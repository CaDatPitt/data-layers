By noarmr C. MACIIESNEY

This typewriter is about to launch
into a rave review by Clifford Odets’
“Golden Boy” as done by the Pitt
Players.

A difficult play to interpret be-
cause of the many character types
and a difficult play to stage be-
cause of the multiple changes of
setting, Pitt Players have harness-
ed it shrewdly. In fact, they would
seem to have met Mr. Odets more
than half-way.

Odets’ Best Work

“Golden Boy” is probably far
and away better theatrical fare than
any other Odets play. He is still re-
cording rather than creating, still
not quite dramatically mature and
all of his faults are as plain to see
in his playwriting as white ﬁg-
ures on a blackboard, but he has
vigor and a spiritual pressure of
ideas that never let his story down.

By now the professional produc-
tion and the later Hollywood ver-
sion have made the story a pretty
familiar one. It tells about the in-

Pitt Players will present “Gold-
en Boy,” their last production of
the current season, for the second
and ﬁnal time this evening at 8:15
o’clock in Foster memorial.

ternal conﬂict of an unhappy boy
who has some hope of becoming an
expert musician, but whose in-
ordinate ambition leads him to
trade cadenzas for uppercuts.

“Golden Boy” relates Joe Bona-
parte’s struggle concretely and well
. . . the swift although unthinking
plunge into the ﬁght world, the ﬁrst
defensive ﬁghts in which he sub-
consciously protects his musician’s
hands from danger, the growing lust
for success, the love for the girl who
belongs to his boss, the separation
from his family, the defeat and
death of his opponent, the ﬁnal
disillusionment.

Outstanding Cast

Director Buell Whitehill has as-
sembled a cast that is entirely com-
petent to develop such a pungent
story. Chief among these is Law-
rence Morris-who gives an intelli-
gent and sensitive picture of the un-
happy Bonaparte.

Bob Ryan as the ﬁght manager;
James Dunn as Tokio, the trainer;
Allen Gould, as the excitable Roxy:
and August Trovaioli, as grim
Fuseli, the gangster, have their roles
sharply defined at the core, and they
al_l deliver realistic, incisive per-
formances.

Leo Harter, in a difficult assign-
ment plays the father of Joe gent-
ly and persuasively, if not always
with a convincing Italian manner.
Israel Grossman, as Siggie, the so-
cial-conscious, cab—driving brother-~
in-law of‘ Joe shows a talent for ‘vis-
ualizing the rough, impulsive qual-
ities of the part.

Biology Group
To Visit Mine

Two trips have been combined
into one for the Collembolae ﬁeld
trip on Sunday. The trip will in-
clude a biology ﬁeld trip outside of
Uniontown and an expedition to
the Ralph mine of the Frick Coal
company.

At 10 o’clock in the morning, an
“early-bird” group will meet for
a biology ﬁeld trip. After this, the
group will pick up the late-risers
in Uniontown and continue on to
the mine.

This second trip is a special at-
traction for those members of Col-
lembolae who want “an-honest—to-
goodness” geology ﬁeld trip, the
leaders declare.

Those who wish to make the trip
are urged to sign up outside the
biology office, and to be at home
Friday when arrangements for the
excursion are made. Transportation
will be provided.

will be held Monday from 3:30 to 5
o’clock on the twelfth floor. Attend-
ance is required for all pledges.

Carnegie Tech Students Get
New United States Postoffice

. By the Anti-Tech Editor

Announcement that a United
States postoﬂice has been estab-
lished at Carnegie Tech reminds us
of the stamp-buying possibilities
here at the University.

‘What was once known as a post-
ofﬁce at Tech up until this week
was nothing more than a place for
the sorting and distribution of mail.
The Tech postofﬁce has been grant-
ed a contract to function as a reg-
ular government station, and in
addition to its former functions,
now takes care of money orders,
registered mail, and wholesale sell-
ing of stamps. Tech students can
even cash money orders there.

This is in contrast with Pitt stu-
dents who have to go all the way
down to the Oakland station on
Myron street to buy post cards.

The University postofﬁce. located
in 167 Cathedral. adequately
handles the thousands of pieces of
mails that come in and go out each
day, according to the mail clerk.

However, purchase of money or-
ders, registered mail, and purchase
of more than a few stamps or post-
cards cannot be made here. Stu-

dents are permitted to mail letters
through the University postofﬁce,
and can sometimes buy stamps.

University postal employees ex-
plained that there isn’t much great-
er demand than this for regular
postal services, and therefore the
system is adequate. Probability of
establishment of a United States
postofﬁce in the near future also was
discounted.

“The University doesn’t need a
better postoffice, it needs more post-
ofiice,’ one employee said. confused.

CA Announces
New Functions

F rankovich Explains

Reorganization Plan

New functions, designed to make
the College association more effec-
tive as a government group for stu-
dents in the College, have been set
up by the CA cabinet and commit-
tees which met twice this week,
furthering plans for reorganization.

G. Richard Frankovich, C41, vice-
president, stated the new proposals
tend to eliminate the overlapping
of jobs in the organization at pres-
ent, and eliminate alsothe disper-
sion of authority. “There will be
centralization. CA wants to create
a closer relationship between fac-
ulty and students in the College and
also a greater uniﬁcation of stu-
dents in the College itself,” Franko-
vich explained.

Outstanding among the proposed
new functions are:

1. CA members act as student
aides at registration, assisting stu-
dents of the college.

2. Sponsoring of activity for-
ums with activity leaders to discuss
various activities in the College.

3. To improve the system of fac-
ulty advisers for freshmen so that
students will see them more often
than at present.

4. To furnish
ance clinics for
dents.

Carlson to Start
Opening Round
With 5 Seniors

. By ART REINSTEIN

Pitt’s Golden Panthers step
out in basketba1l’s high society
tonight, meeting North Caro-
1ina’s VVhite Phantoms in the
ﬁrst round of the NCAA basket‘-
ball championship tournament
at Madison, Wis.

No slick trick of the hardwood
game will be missing when the
embattled Panthers try to get in
the ﬁrst blow in this “sudden death”
elimination series. Both teams have
played sound, well—drilled basket-
ball all year, at least in spots, and
should be at top speed as they go
“all out” for the biggest prize the
game has to offer.

One big problem faces the Panth-
ers. His name is George Glamack,
he stretches 6 ft. 7 in. into the at-
mosphere and up to enemy baskets,
and he has averaged something like
20 points a game. Glamack is not
only the most elusive of the Phan-
toms, he’s practically the whole
ball club.

And Pitt mentor, Doc Carlson,
thinks that his defensive set-up will
stop the dangerous Glamack colder
than the Stadium in mid-winter.
Duke University, no Panther in
basketball strength, tied up Gla-
mack twice, and won both times,
by taking diagnostician Carlson’s
advice on how to stop the Tarheel
ace.

While Glamack carries the whole
load for North Carolina, and tries
to ﬁght off close-checking Mel Port,

termined the winner of the trophy.
The nearest challenger to the cup
had a total of 106 points.

This afternoon on the home camp-
us. the same team will again meet

Pitt Players’ Director

LAST WEDNESDAY Pitt Players presented
“Golden Boy.”

That the play may have been considered good
or not good by those who saw it is of little con-
sequence. What does matter is that there are
so many students interested in the develop-
ment of what is one of the oldest forms of artistic
expression.

Those who know Buell ‘Whitehill well say
that he is hard and exacting. For this, he has
made some enemies and a good many more
friends. Whatever  be said of him, it must
be conceded that he has produced results.

Never has he cast any role wit‘:.iout t1'».e idea
in mind that it was his job to present a well-
acted play. This has been his '"irst law and to
that law he has constantly adhered, placing it
before any motives of favoritism and general
popularity.

He has rais+:c‘». the status -3.." Pl j-xers from an
activities—point-garnering‘ «:-rganiza ion to that of
a group of interested students presenting, time
and again, performances which may be ‘termed
professional.
I From his actors he has developed into 1"

dication of a job well done.

Sociology §.’roject
Anal its Beadiy Risks

The current practice of suggesting “actual”
problems to students has resulted. in several in-
vcidents which, frankly, have left us gasping at
the average students susceptibility to sugges-
tion.

To illustrate a lecture at a famous eastern
school, an inquisitive freshman opened a tank
of chlorine gas in a dormitory. His housemates.
not appreciative of the Hemingway realism
touch, took to the streets.

At a Southern California school, two more
freshmen took a sociological ﬁeld trip to see
“how the other half lives.” Some time later,
they tangled with a couple of police ofﬁcers,
were arrested for vagrancy, and suffered 1) “a
nose fracture, a black eye, and face and leg
bruises,” and 2) “a cracked chestbone, a black
eye, a broken tooth, and body bruises.”

The two boys positively identiﬁed the “as-
saulting ofﬁcers” out of a lineup of 55 police-
men “in four rows, identically uniformed and
without stars.”

We’re worrying about this tendency of the
student to ﬁnd out for himself. Several students
we know are down at the coroner’s office coin-
piling a survey of murders, Pittsburgh, 1910-1925.

A «Criticism of Existing
Solutions to the Problem

(This is the first of two articles, written by James
Butcher, Ed43, on the contemporary situation.)

In the face of existing or impending chaos, it is to
be expected that some of the more thoughtful among
us will give expression to forebodings.

The convictions of such individuals, nurtured as
they are by buffeted intellects, reveal to the casual
student of human nature only a fatalistic deploring of
contemporary tumult. A neutral bystander, willing to
remain aloof from futile prophecy, can readily detect
the abortive evidences of human superﬁciality.

I am convinced that the achievement of human cul-
ture is predicted primarily upon the species’ desire for
self-glorification, and is perpetuated to the more real-
iistic impingements inherent in the institutions which
he creates in order that his achievements might be pos-
sible. Ironically, these institutions do not invariably
Zbuffer; they frequently defeat, by offering themselves
:as alibis, the purposes for which they were created.

The Basis for Judging

The restrictions of society have, by their very ex-
aistence, offered a material basis of evaluation with
which it is possible for members of a cultural pattern
-to categorize a fellow or a group, without regard to a
more fundamental basis for comparison. In effect we
are judged by, and react accordingly to, a man-made
yardstick, conceived to expedite classiﬁcation, not to
promote the attainment of a desired philosophy.

What are the alternatives to this philosophy of prox-
imity which man has chosen to revere in place of a
more admirable one? The answer is not to be given
without consideration. It might be best to scan some
ideologies now given credence and some being con-
sidered, lightly or more ‘seriously. All have as their
precept »a fervent allegiance to that vagary known as
“destiny.”

The Solutions So F ar

The quest for a solution most frequently finds its
fulﬁllment in a profound religious conviction. But re-
ligion too in its immediate aspects, churches, repre-
sentatives, and teachings, typiﬁes adherence to estab-
lished institutions. Christianity has not provided a prin-
ciple so universal in its appeal as to be able to embrace
heterogeneous human interests and give them judicious
admiration.

In addition there has not been established concretely
an affiliation with or rejection of, emanating truths de-
manding either acceptance or refutation. In not being
taught either to recognize, or discard, many have had
recourse only to an uncertainty far worse in the last
analysis.

Others may and do seek the solution in speciﬁc
achievement, with its accompanying idolatry. In this
grouping might be listed most political ideologies.
These also enlist many supporters, but are to a great
extent, responsible for contemporary bewilderment.

t

‘No accomplishment is able to continue nor is worthy

of continuance which pretends merely to establish an
altered status on an unaltered perspective. Such a
list might be endless, encompassing even the anomalies
of moral rearmament and kindred secular Waifs.

l The American Empire

The American Empire is an economic need. Capi-
talist economic systems must expand outside national
boundaries in order to stave off internal economic
change. And our system will expand in an empire
sort of way because it is more proﬁtable to the con-
trol group, more practical to the politicians, and con-
eistent with the status quo.

Rhodes : Empire Builder

I wasn’t by any means the ﬁrst to think this up. A
fellow by the name of Cecil Rhodes (South Africa and
scholarships and the British Empire) was once quoted,
back in 1895, as having said some very interesting
things, for instance:

“I was in the East end of London yesterday and
attended a meeting of the unemployed. I listened to
the wild speeches, which were just a cry for “bread,
bread, bread,” and on my way home I pondered over
the scene and I became more than ever convinced of
the importance of imperialism . . My cherished idea
is a solution for the social problem, i.e., in order to
save the 40,000,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom
from a bloody civil war, we colonial statesmen must
acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to
provide the new markets for the goods produced by
them in the factories and mines. The Empire, as I
have always said, is a bread and butter question. If
you want to avoid civil war, you must become im-
perialists.”

To Avert Explosion

And another fellow by the name of Wahl said,
“Owing to the difficulties of life which weigh not only
on the masses of the workers, but also on the middle
classes, impatience, irritation, and hatred are accu-
mulating in all the countries of the old civilization and
are becoming a menace to public order; employment
must be found for the energy which is being hurled
out of the deﬁnite class channel; it must be given an
outlet abroad in order to avert an explosion at home.”

In a way this seems to apply to our own present
condition in which to avoid a reaction to reform, Mr.
Roosevelt has to indulge in power politics to draw off
the energy of the business men who were all for
wrecking the New Deal. (This is the third of a series
of articles.) ‘

Swing Things
1 By A: 1. Gator

Probably you’ve never heard of
“Calypso” music. We never had
until Decca came forth with an
album last week called, “Harlem
Seen Through Calypso Eyes.”

“Calypso” is the music of the na-
tives of Trinidad, according to the
album booklet without which we
would have been lost. The records
are the original, descriptive im-
pressions of Harlem life sung by a
Trinidadian, Wilmoth Houdini, now
entertaining at the Villege Van-
guard in Greenwich Village. He

sings of alley cats, popcorn men,
and married life in off-key chants
of accented English.

0 Savage, Spanish Rhythms

All the records have that peculiar
admixture of savage and Spanish
rhythms. After listening for a while
however, the weird monotonous
strains got us.

(Sub—sub editor’s note: In a
sense these records are folk music,
quite modern folk music, and to this
sub-sub personage, very interesting
and humorous. Othver records made
by the Calypso singers of the Brit-
ish owned island, were very popu-
lar during the past year. Our sub-
sub visited the Vanguard last sum-
mer and stood in the cellar there-
because of both the minimum and
the crowd—and heard some songs
personally and now considers him-
self an authority.)

0 Swing Classics

After an absence of quite a few
weeks Victor this week releases the
famous “Swing Classics” once again.
On this one Duke Ellington holds
forth with two compositions by his
son, Mercer. “Blue Serge” is sort
of a spineless, tuneless creation—
blues carried beyond reason.
“Jumpin’ Punkins” has a lilt and a
lot ‘of drive. It’s the kind of thing
Wl'11Ch will satisfy the connoisseur
but leave the average listener un-
impressed.

Final EXEIIII for telephones

HIS electrical ‘mouth at Bell Telephone Laboratories is
putting a new telephone to one of its ﬁnal tests. ‘Over
and over, it can repeat these odd sentences without the slight-
est variation. They contain all the fundamental sounds that con-
tribute to the loudness of sound in our speech. This month can
also make tests with simple tones of known pitch and intensity.
At the same time other telephones are being steamed, baked,
frozen, lifted and dropped into their cradles by tireless ma-
chines. All this is part of a carefully planned curriculum
that makes every piece of telephone equip-

ment prove it is capable of giving you the best
possible se-rvice—under any and all conditions.

Chatter

by Bill JIoElu:ain

Sports Editor

 

_Alt.hough Pittsburgh basketball fans are having difficulty real-
izing it and Penn State fans refuse to believe it at all, Dr. H. Clifford
Carlson and his “busy bees” seek to clear the ﬁrst hurdle tonight
in their bid for the National Collegiate Atlile-tic association ﬂoor
title.

The Pittsburghers knew that the Panthers had a good year,
‘but hardly anyone expected they would be asked to compete in the
country ’s most important tournament. The Penn S-taters still
cherish the idea that their beloved Lions deserved the invitation

. more than did Pitt.

Be that as it may. there is no possible doubt that the team
which opposes North Carolina at Madison in the quarter-ﬁnals this
evening will really be Pitt. \Vhat remains unsettled is how long
Dr. Carlson ’s boys will remain in the running.

Privately, we have a hunch that it may be longer than the
average observer would think. \Ve have practically convinced
ourselves that this Pitt team can win any game it sets its heart on
winning. ’

The boys certainly aren't nnderrating teams like North Caro-
lina, Dartmouth, and \Visconsin, but for various reasons we agree
with Dr. Carlson's contention that a. trip to the ﬁnals at Kansas
City next week is not out of the question.

Car0lina’s hopes for advancement to the second round rest
on towering George Glamack, a gent who can see out of only one
eye, but who has seen out of it well enough to rank as one of the
country "s leading scorers. Carlson believes that if the Panthers can
stop Glamack, the Carolinans will be ﬁnished. That Glamacl: can
be stopped has been deinonstratea on a few occasions, and the occa-
sions have been coincident with North Carolina losses.

Dartmouth has Gus Broberg, a splendid forward, but’ even
Broberg has not been enough to keep the Indians unbeaten. Prince-
ton dumped the New Englanders in the ﬁnal game of the regular
season. It could happen again, reasons the Doctor, with Pitt doing
the dumping.

This leaves ‘Wisconsin, beaten by the Panthers in the season ’s
opener. Gene Englund is a real threat, and Pitt would have trouble
checking him, but just because it’s \Visconsin’s turn to win is no
reason to expect Pitt to take a trimming.

Having neatly disposed of all opposition for the Panthers
(you’re welcome, Doctor), we pass on to our main point, which is
just this: the 1941 Pitt basketball team is potentially one of the
best in the country, perhaps the best. They play their ﬁnest game
when the chips are down, and the chips are certainly down now.

Short series like the N CAA’ tourney are not always conclusive
and a lot of good teams have fallen by the wayside when least
expected (remember Duquesnel). Consequently, we don’t care to
predict, but——don’t count the Panthers out.

Jots and Dashes: Stan VVoodWard recently signed Pitt’s Ted
Konetsky and George Kracum for the 1941 Eastern all-star game
. . . which isn’t odd . . . since Stan made up his mind about Konetsky
when he saw the Panther captain in action against Missouri this
past fall.

Hal Klein will join the professional football Pitt alumni asso-
ciation next season meaning Jock Sutherland’s Brooklyn
Dodgers . . . with Ben Kish in the army, the Dodgers were short on
their Pitt representation. ‘ '-

Continued from page one
quintet of capable shooters at the
Tarheel defense. ‘
Doc Carlson plans to start his
senior ﬁve again, though reserves
Larry Paffrath, Lefty Ziolkowski,
and Tay Malarkey are almost sure
to see action. Junior Jim Egan and
sophomores John Swacus and Bob
Artman are also at Madison and
may be needed it the fast pace
wears down the Panther regulars.
Starting for Pitt will be Ed Stra-
loski. sharp-eyied little forward

. who showed Madison fans a sample

of his shooting ability by rolling up
16 points against Wisconsin; Mel
Port, dependable red-head whose
biggest assignment will be to tie
up Phantom flash Glamack; defen-
sive. star Sam Milanovich; hand-
some pitch-er Jimmy Klein; and
hard-playing George Kocheran, re-
nowned in the C'=rolina camp for
his ‘great performance against Duke.

Both teams play a deliberate,
short-passing game and take few
chances on the circus tactics em-
ployed by western clubs. The
Phantoms, however, depend almost
entirely on Glamack to break
through and ring up his hook shots.
If Pitt stops Glamaack, the Panth-
ers are in.

Next opponent for Carlson’s kids
will be Wisconsin or Dartmouth.
Should the Panthers drop the deci-
sion to North Carolina, they will
meet the loser of the Wisconsin-
Dartmouth battle in the prelimin-
ary game Saturday night. Most
probable ﬁnal round pairing, how-
ever, is Pitt and Wisconsin in Sat-
urday’s feature for the Eastern di-
vision title of the NCAA.

As Doc Carlson puts it: “If we
beat North Carolina, we’re in the
semi-ﬁnals; if we win again, we’re
in the ﬁnals; if we win that one,
we’re in clover.”

Come triumphs over North Caro-
lina and Wisconsin (or Dartmouth),
Pitt will meet the Western division
winner at Kansas City on March 29
for the NCAA title.

Independents, Electricals Score Wins

To Clinch League Championship Cups

Bulletin — Bowling playoﬂs be- enemy plays, and scored eight points

tween the fraternity champions,
Pi Lambda Phi, and the Independ-
ent titleholders, Amity Club, will
be held today at 4:30. The match-
es will be at the University Rec-
reation Center Alleys.

By virtue of their decisive victor-
ies over the second place challengers
last Tuesday evening, the Indepen-
dents and the Electrical Engineers
walked away with the independent
and engineering championships.

The ﬂoor wars of Tuesday even-
ing opened with the Electricals
swamping a highly favored AE &
ME combination by the score of
23-11. Rudy Tratar copped most
of the individual glory in this upset
victory as he consistently broke up

for high point man of the game.
John Knoll hung up ﬁve markers
for the losing cause of the AE & ME
team.

This victory over their arch-riv-
als gave the Electricals undisputed

ﬁrst place with a season record. of"

nine wins and one defeat. The AE
quintet with an honorable mark of
nine victories against two losses
ﬁnished in second place.
Edgar Jones Stars

The independent league scramble
ﬁnally ended last Tuesday evening
when the pre—season favorites, In-
dependents, toppled an underdog
Big Five basketball team by the
score of 32-12.

with 14 points to -his credit, sparked
his team to the triumph. Hal Knus-
man helped the Independent cause
quite a bit, ringing up 10 points.

The Independents ﬁnished the
season with a total of 12 triumphs
against one defeat for ﬁrst place,
while the Big Five copped second
place with 11 and two. Last year’s
independent league titleholder, Val-
ley Boys, ended in third place with
8 victories and three losses.

The Phi Kappa and the Phi“ Delts
batt].ed in the last game of the eve-
ning to break their deadlock for
third place in the IF league stand-
ing. This proved to be the best
contest of the evening as the last
year’s champions were extended
before they could pull out a 40-24
victory.

Tyberski Scores 20

Bobby Tyberski ﬁnally came into
prominence by making 20 points to
pace the Phi Kaps to their third
place cup. Tyberski has been cast
into the background for the past
two seasons by the brilliant play-
ing of his teammate, Jack Glenn,
but last Tuesday Tyberski, not his
all-intramural brother, gained the
limelight.

Rae Young, playing his usual ﬁne
ﬁoor game, came through again
with high point totals for his Phi
Delta Theta team with 11 markers.

Michigan Swimmers Dominate
Pitt All-(Ipponont ZVominations

As has been the case year after
year, the super all-opponent swim-
ming squad named by the Panther
mermen isconspicuously top heavy
with Wolverine champions. And
for a good reason, since the aquatic
stars were chosen on the basis of
outstanding performances against
the Panthers in dual meets this sea-
son. '

It seems that every time; Matt
Mann’s mighty Michigan rnermen
make with the muscles, they walk
away ,with some sort of record. In
the Big Ten swimming champion-
ships‘ just concluded, the boys from
Harmonville took ﬁrst place by a
“meager” 68 point margin.
Michigan Mermen Outstanding

On Pitt’s list of troublesome op-
position, Michigan takes six of the
available eight first team posts and
comes in second at one of the tvo
spots not accounted for. The Wol-
verines excelled in the Medley Re-
lay, 220 free style, 150-yard back-
stroke. 200-yard breaststroke, and
the 400—yard free style relay.

Barker, Skinner. and Williams
combined to down the Panther med-
ley relay entry, when the two teams
met earlier in the season. They
were “clocked” at 3:043, and though
this time is good enough to win
against almo:t any opposition, th«:_~.
trio even showed improvement in
later matches. Barker, by the way,

.7lfedici.s Sextet
Score i7ourth
Period Victory

After a very closely matched
game between the teams captained
by Harriet Blair, C43, and Mildred
Medic, C44, the freshman team
came out ahead by a score of 25
to 14.

Both teams ﬁnished up the first
half with a score of ten each, but
the freshmen shot ahead in the
fourth quarter and ended up the
victors. High score for the game
was freshman Ann Agnew, who
played an outstanding game both in
baskets made and ﬂoor play.

Games scheduled for next week
have been revealed by chairman
Mary Hilda Fagan, Ed41. On Mon-
day at 4:30 o’clock, Midge Ander-
son’s junior team will play Lois
Davis’ freshman physical educa-
tion major team.

Oﬁicials .for that same game will
be Dorrie Weaver, Ed41, Ruth
Steeb, Ed41, Adele Yorio, Ed41, and
Florence Boney, Ed41.

This game will be followed on
Tuesday by a game between Harriet
Blair, C43, and Mabel Moore, C43.
WAA members who will ofﬁciate at
these games will be Harriet. Harris,
Ed42, Irma Hotz, Ed41, Patsy Deans,
Ed41, and Florence Levy, Ed42.

As this has been scheduled as a
double elimination tournament, all
teams which have either lost or for-
feited one game will be given an
opportunity to play again before
the tournament is over.

Captains have been asked to
check with Mrs. Robb in the W0-
men’s Health Service concerning the
health ratings of their team mem-
bers. All participants must have an
“A” health rating to take part in
the tournament.

However, any girl whose health
rating is not high enough, may
check with Dr. Jamison, and receive
permission to play. This must be
taken care of immediately by each
team captain.

New Instrument
Helps Bradford

An electromagnetic microbaro-
graph is now in operation on the
roof of the Cathedral, announces
Donald C. Bradford, University
seismologist.

“The microbarograpn detects
and measures small periodic pres-
sure ﬂuctuations in the atmos-
phere, which ordinary instruments
will not show,” says Bradford.

The instrument was constructed
by James Shear, a. graduate stu-
dent assistant in physics.

for three years.

Michigan’s Earl Patton won the
mythical nod for his 2:18.6 perform-
ance in the 220-yard free style race;
Dick Price of Franklin and Mar-
shall lost out by four seconds.

Ohio State Divers Tops

Buckeye free styler Bob Leitt,
with a 24.1 in the 50 gave the Panth-
ers more trouble than Bill Kirkpat-
rick of Penn State. Charles Rein-
icker, another Ohio State star, re-
corded a quicker time in the 100-
yard tree style than Gus Sharmet
of Michigan. Although Sharmet is
rated as the fastest 100 man in the
country, he just wasn’t giving his
best at the Panther meet.

There was very little doubt as to
who would win the divine laurels.
Both Earl Clark and Arnold D:—mp-
sey are graduates of the Patnil:
school in the art of springboard
capers. They’ve spent their ap-
prentice years, learning how to dive,
from the greatest diver of all time.
And since the graduation of Al Pat-
nik from Ohio State, Clark and
Dempsey have continued the tradi-
tion of winning all the diving titles
available.

Smith Explains Similarity

Of Musical,

. By CHARLES CAMARATA

Verbal Wit

The similarity of jazz and slang, musical wit and verbal wit, was
explained by S. Stephenson Smith, educational adviser for the American
Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, last Monday in Foster

memorial.

Lecturing on “The American Language—Words and Music,” Smith

stated that just as idiomatic slang
is peculiar to the American lan-
guage, so is jazz a deﬁnite part of
American folkson$——and both are
used as vehicles of humor.

Smith told how, in his experience
with the entertainment world, he
had become acquainted with the
lingo of the stage, radio, and motion
picture industry. He gave a few
examples of each.

“For example,” said Smith, “the
people of the stage and the musical
revue use such terms as ‘legit’ to
mean legitimate, as the legitimate
stage, and “pic’ for picture, ‘B O’
for box oﬁice, ‘hypo’ for box ofﬁce
increase. Some fancy coinage of
the movies are ‘budgetitis,’ referring
to economy in production, and ‘bud-
geteers,’ meaning a person whose
job it is to see that the cost of pro-
duction is not excessive.”

As examples of radio slang, Smith
gave the following: “adenoid” means
a person with a tight, high voice;
“canary” or “Madame Cadenza”
means a soprano; “cliff hangover,”
a serial; “creeper,” a person who
moves about in the radio studio;
and “Lady Macbeth,” an aged tra-
gedienne. A funny line is spoken
of as an “O. Henry;” “tear jerker”
is a highly centimental story; and
“turkey” is a ﬂop or failure.

Continuing further his discussion
of radio, Smith said that profession-
al men of radio are always skeptical
of educational programs, and try to
steer clear of them.

Smith gave several reasons why
he thought slang and idiomatic hu-
mor find such favor with the Amer-
ican people.

“The American people use slang
as much as they do because they
have a sense of irreverence, because
they don’t like anything that looks
like a ‘stuffed shirt.’ Another rea-
son is the American liking for speed
in everything they do. As for hu-
mor, radio humor especially, it usu-
all falls in between two poles; that
is, exaggeration or tall talk like
Mark Twain uses, at the one pole,
and ironic understatement or the
‘picklepuss’ variety, at the other.”

As for the permanence of jazz,
swing and the blues, Smith pre-
dicted that not ﬁve per cent of such
modern music would become a part
of the American folk song reper-
tory, just as less than ﬁve per cent
of contemporary slang words and
phrase would ﬁnd their way into
the standard American language.

Smith then gave the examples of
a slang word and a jazz song which
he thinks will become permanent
and standard. They are the word
“razz” and the song “St. Louis
Blues.”

ﬁghts against her growing love for
Joe and as she seeks to slow his
driving urge to be top man with
money. Peggy Martin, as Joe’s sis-

As much credit for the success
of the undertaking should go to the
technical staff as the performers.
Confronted with the task of 12
changes of scene on the limited con-

Gallup Survey
Reveals Views

On Education

Poll Discovers Many
Surprising Opinions

Student Opinion Surveys of America

AUSTIN. Tex., March 20.—Last
year the National Education asso-
ciation had Dr. George Gallup con-
duct a survey that revealed only 17
per cent of the adults in this coun-
try feel too much importance is be-
ing placed on education these days.

What about college training? It
is the advisability of higher edu-
cation that often causes debate
. . . “The colleges are over-crowd-
ed . . . we are grinding out bach-
elors of art as if by machinery

look at men like Ford and
Knudsen who never went to col-
lege.” Student Opinion Surveys of
America has taken the question di-
rectly to that group of nearly a
million and a half young Ameri-
cans now going through the process
of higher education.

Do they feel that the idea of go-
ing to college is being emphasized
too much, about right, or too little?

Every fourth student that the in-
terviewers contacted answered
“yes, there is too much emphasis.”
A slight majority of 51 per cent
declared “just about right,” and the
rest said “too little.”

Although three-fourths of the stu-
dents believe higher education is
not being pushed too much in this
country—which already has in its
colleges and universities a greater
proportion of its youth than any
other nation——a surprising set of
answers was obtained from this
question:

“Without mentioning names, do
you know any students personally
who would be better off at work
than in college?”

YES, said . . . . . . . . . . . .88 per cent
N 0, said . . . . . . . . . . . . . .12 per cent.

Of course, any response to that
question is necessarily based on
personal opinion. Barring prejudices
and some duplication, the survey
nevertheless provides an indication
of the extent to which many col-
leges may be wasting their energies
on campus misﬁts.

More men than women believe
there is overemphasis on college
education, the results of the poll
show. This is perhaps to be at-
tributed to the greater demand for
“college men” than for “college
women” that has been in vogue for

some time. A tabulation by sexes
follows:
