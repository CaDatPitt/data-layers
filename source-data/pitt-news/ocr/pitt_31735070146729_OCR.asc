Pitt forwards State Department alert

‘The University advised students studying

abroad in Europe to take extra precautions‘
after the U.S. Department of State issued
a warning Sunday about possible terrorist
attacks on the continent. .
The alert, which expiresjan. 31, has no
affected study abroad students’ classes or
travel throughout Europe and should not
affect spring study abroad programs, said
Jeffrey Whitehead, interim director of the
Study Abroad Office. I
An e—mail sent to students Sunday night
included a link to the travel alert — which is
one step below a more serious travel warn-
ing — and recommendations for staying

He said students should “maintain cau-
tion and vigilance in their travels” and in-
structed them to walk away from a situation
at the ﬁrst sign of trouble. Whitehead also
warned students‘ to make sure they keep
their cell phones fully charged, turned on
and with them at all times.

He also encouraged students to register
with the embassy nearest to the city where
they study, a tip the U.S. Department of
State echoed when it suggested that U.S.
citizens should register their travel plans
with the embassy nearest them.

“At this time,_ this travel alert will
not affect programs for next semester,”
Whitehead said. “We will make the same’
recommendations to our spring students
that We are currently making to our fall

. students.”

with their parents about the best possible

- location, since “study abroad is typically a

decision that a family makes together.”

Safety should always play a role when
students decide where to study abroad,
he said. 4

Current information from the Depart-
ment of Statesuggestedxthat al—Qaida and
afﬁliated organizations are continuing to
plan terrorist attacks on major tourist des-
tinations across Western Europe.

The main targets, according to the U.S.
Department of State website, include public
transportation systems and other tourist-
attracting infrastructures. Terrorists have

Melissa Swafford, a junior who plans to
study abroad in Spain in the spring, was
shocked to hear about the travel alert but
ultimately said that it will most likely not
affect her plans.

“This is the chance of a lifetime. People
always say you have to do it. I don’t want
fear to ‘overrule my drive to go. I think I’ll

Government hopes to lower dropout rate

application process increased students’ ac-
cess to ﬁnancial aid. He said the government
now needs to help students graduate.

“It’s sad to say 56 percent of students

' who enter college graduate in six years, and

one of the problems is the idea of how we
should and canﬁnd and develop ﬁnancial
aid programs,” Caperton said.

Caperton called this a waste of money.
Students face mounting costs — the U.S.
Bureau of Labor estimated that tuition in-
creases at twice the rate of inﬂation. Fail-
ing to complete —— a degree means wasted
funds.

He blamed uncompleted college degrees
on students. A

“The waste of cost that is, not the fact
that they go, but the fact that they haven’t
prepared themselves to go,” he said.

A generation ago, the United States pro-
duced proportionally the largest amount of
college graduates in the world. Today, itsits
ninth in global rankings.

Duncan and Caperton mentioned plans
meant to spur students toward graduation.
Most involved ﬁnancial reward. Graduates
who work in public service will have loans
forgiven after 10 years.

. Those not working in public service will
have income—based repayment. Loan pay-
ments are capped after students have paid
10 percent of their yearly income. D

Colleges that cap tuition, adopt three-
year programs and have a “no-frills campus”
can make graduating easier for students,
Duncan said.

He also said the government can act as
a “bully pulpit” to encourage colleges to
give students a good educationfor a good
price. I

EA should stick
to The Sims

hings were simple in the days of
I The Sims.

Controversies were few and limited to
the occasional affair, child abduction by
aliens or a Grim Reaper appearance.

But now, with Electronic Arts’ new

Medal of Honor first—person shooter, p

everything’s a bit more complicated.

Set to release this month, the game is
“set in the midst of the bloody conﬂict
in Afghanistan [and] is as realistic as it
because real_Special Operations soldiers
from that conﬂict helped them make it
that way,” reports MSNBC.

We see problems already, but few "

people-owere apparently bothered by the
game until word got out that it featured
a multiplayer mode that allowed players

to ﬁght or play as the Taliban. Accord-'

ing to MSNBC, Electronic Arts opted to
remove the Taliban name after hearing
from friends and family of soldiers killed
by the Taliban.

Other than the removal of the Tali-
ban name, nothing about the game was
changed. .

In our opinion, a simple name omis—_
sion doesn’t really change anything.

We fear the game is likely to fuel an-
ti-Muslim sentiment at a particularly
Vulnerable time — amidst debates on
whether or not a mosque should be built
at the site of the Sept. 11 attacks.

And although all war games stand to
turn war into entertainment, we find

problems with Medal of Honor being

concurrent with the war it is simulat-

mg.

What makes this dangerous is that a
lot ofpeople playing it might not under-
stand the context of the game. We’re sure
there are plenty of gamers up to date on
current events, but we’re also sure there
are plenty who aren’t.

The game is also distasteful, disre-
spectful and inappropriate.

On Fox 82 Friends, Karen Meredith,
the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq
said, “War is not a game, period. They’ve
already done games about World War II
but that’s far enough removed. People
aren’t dying in World War II anymore 
Right now we’re going into a really bad
time in Afghanistan, we’ve just come off
of the worst month of causalities in the
whole year  families who are burying

their children are going to be seeing and

playing this game. I just don’t see how a
video game based on a current war makes
any sense at all.”

Video games have always been at-
tacked for being too violent. In N ovem—
ber, the Supreme Court will hear a chal-
lenge to a California law banning the
sale or rental of certain “violent” vide
games to minors. ‘ ‘

Medal of Honor will not only be vio-
lent but also authentic to a currently
ongoing conﬂict, according to MSNBC.

And although it could be argued that
the game will educate players about the
true experience of Special Operations
soldiers, when it comes down to it, video
games are really just for entertainment
and profit. I

When profile becomes person

How ’.bout a round of applause for social media performances

Kayla Hunter
For the Pitt News

This summer, at a coffee farm in Nicaragua
without electricity or running water, I wound"
up witnessing an accidental social experi-
ment. Though my primary comfort concern
had been remaining calm in a spider—infest—
ed outhouse the size of a refrigerator, what
ended up being more difficult to deal with
was the blanketing darkness.

_ The sun sets around 5 p.m. there, hours
before our group of 10 undergraduates and
two graduate instructors was able to fall
asleep. We didn’t have a campﬁre and were
not willing to drain our ﬂashlight batteries for
the sake of shadow puppets. So we were left in
the dark with nothing to entertain ourselves
but that most archaic of all communication
forms —- face-to—face conversation.

This scene had all the elements of my most

‘nostalgic bonding moments at Girl Scout

camp, but something was different this time.
The darkness, the erasure of faces, ‘made it
feel a little as if no one else was there —~ just
a collection of ﬂoating voices. '
Instead of telling stories, we threw out
random quips that dissolved, into nothing,
creating a conversational black hole. At the
time, I didn’t think of this as peculiar — we

‘ were tired and didn’t know each other really 4

well, so we did what we could to be friendly

' and avoid awkwardness.

;Then, back in ‘Pittsburgh a month later,
the 29- and 34-year-old graduate students

who were present that night commented to
me that they had been baffled by the conver-
sation, or lack thereof. It wasn’t the topics
that were unfamiliar to them, but rather the
way in which we were talking. One of them
described it as “15 different CD players play-
ing pop culture sound bites.”

I realized at that moment that I had wit-
nessed social media surreptitiously replicat-
ing itself in real life. We, the world’s young
Internet addicts, responded to social awk—.
wardness by falling back on the tactics of

. the medium with which we were most com-

fortable: Facebook. A place where we spurt
out disconnected snippets tonobody and
everybody at the same time, where we do
whatever we can to seem cool or funny, be-
cause you never know who is listening or
watching, only that somebody is.

Online, we have become more performers
than partakers in a conversation, whether
we’re being nosy Voyeurs or narcissistic acé
tors. We become mini-versions of the celebri-
ties we obsess over on blogs and E! and VH1
— at least in our heads. And now these ten-
dencies are spilling over into our real lives.

But what happens when we start perform-
ing so much that we stop listening? What hap-
pens when we become a copies of the copies of
ourselves we create online, and those copies
happen to be incredibly self—absorbed?

Google the phrase“generation of entitle-
ment,” and you’ll ﬁnd that our elders have
already been discussing this occurrence in

a variety of forums, from teaching blogs to
sociology journals. In her book “Genera—
tion Me,” Dr. Jean Twenge chronicles the
simultaneous proliferation of self-esteem and
depression in young people who, after repeat-
ing the mantra “I am unique” all throughout
their childhood, hit ‘adulthood to ﬁnd out
that, well, what do you know, they’re not all
that unique. .
Perhaps Facebook is just one way of deal-
ing with this reality —— ina modern world
ever more connected, competitive, public

and entrenched in the celebrity, we feel tinier
every day —— increasingly aware that each one
of us embodies less than one six-billionth of
the creative energy on this planet.

So we perform online to create something
that is only ours, without realizing that we’re
just further complicating things. With Fa-
cebook, private and public lives have been
fused, and somewhere along the line the self
has been muddied, if not lost altogether.

v We’re not alone in this. ‘ 1
It seems that no one is immune.This phe-

nomenon has been encapsulated in real life
once again in the oh—so—Facebook-esque
ﬂurry of controversy surrounding “The S0-
cial Networ ,” the recently released movie
about the creation of Facebook.

In the mainstream media’s unshakable
eye, Facebo‘ok’s ironically private creator,

‘Mark Zuckerberg, has criticized the ﬁlm’s

storyline —' which hints that he might have
stolen the idea for the website — for being
overly dramatized and ﬁctional. According to

Facebook is only about profileimage, says Hunter

tried to make behind-the—scenes changes to
the script to portray Zuckerberg’s character
more positively. _ .

Then, in what New York magazine re-
ferred to as “the PR move of the month,”
Zuckerberg announced on Oprah last week
that he’ll donate $100 million to schools in
Newark, NJ. — an impressive philanthropic

move that comes at a very opportune mo- ~

ment.
After all, we all know Facebook is only

the Wall Streetjournal, Facebook executives about proﬁle image. ﬂ

Songwriter Grutka opens up

i Liz Keeney
Staffwriter

Mike Grutka
Howlers Coyote Cafe
Wednesday at 9 p.m.
412-682-0320

It’s not every day that you wake up and decide
to change your life.

For singer—songwriter Mike Grutka, that
day came about ﬁve andla half years ago. With
the release of his newest album, February
Sessions, and an upcoming show at Howlers
Coyote Cafe in Bloomﬁeld, he hopes to show
fans just how far he’s come.

After the death of his mother in 2004,
Grutka, who cites.musicians like Dave Mat-

- _ thews, Neil Young and Michael Stipe among

his many inﬂuences, decided it was time to

“live the life you’re meant to live” — a slogan '

that has inspired all of his albums for the
past several years.

Growing up in Syracuse, N.Y., Grutka
spent most of his childhood listening and
singing along to his parents’ records, learn-
ing the musical nuances he would use later
in life. Although he spent years playing the
violin, Grutka truly realized his love of the
art when he joined the jazz band in high
school. ,

“It was the ﬁrst time music wasn’t a les-
son,” Grutka said of the experience.

Soon after, he began to study music theory

and composition, and with the purchase of a I

$50 guitar from Sears, he started focusing
on learning how to produce as many songs
and sounds as possible. .
“The ﬁrst song I wrote happened by ac-
cident. I was showing off to my brother, and
I just made up a verse in like 10 minutes.
And even though it took me about a year
to actually ﬁnish the song, I got the bug,”
Grutka said. i
, For the next few years Grutka honed his
talent, learning to play as many instruments

' as he could. Aside from the drums, every

instrument featured on February Sessions
was played by Grutka himself, something
mixer/producer Larry Dizizo said sets him
apart from other singer—songwriters.

“My job is to make everything sound co- '

hesive, to bring a better balance to all the

. instruments. So it deﬁnitely makes my job

easier that he can handle all of his instru-
ments,” Dizizo said.

. ‘Dizizo mentioned Grutka’s ability to ar-
range songs —- something the musician at-

tributes to his background in orchestras and

 

Mike Grutka, a singer-songwriter, plays several instruments on his latest album *

musical theater. Grutka also prides himself
on providing listeners with a variety of dif-
ferent song styles on each album.

“Style-wise, I’m all over the place. I guess
I’m a little bit jammy, a little acoustic. I’m best
summed up as acoustic-based funky mod-
ern roots rock’n’roll. I like the harmonies of
bands like R.E.M., but_I also like how Neil
Young has all different kinds of song styles
on each album,” Grutka said.

His new release February Sessions got
its name from an online event called the
RPM Challenge, in which artists compose
and record a full album during the month
of February. Grutka believes that, lyrically,
this album is the most honest and direct he’s
ever created, as several songs, deal with the
death of his mother.

‘‘[After she died] a lot of the songs weren’t

sad. It was so sudden, I talked to her on a
Wednesday and by Friday morning, she was

gone. It inspired a very seize-the-day atti- '

tude. I was working on my third album, and
after that I got bored with what I was doing.
I wasn’t changing,” he said.

In the ﬁve and a half years since her
death, Grutka believes he has grown both

v personally and as a musician. Not only did

he release two records in the span of one year
—— Ria, his album before February Sessions,

came out on iTunes in September 2009 —— .
"but February Sessions is also a new sound

for him. It’s tracks are more organic than

_ his previously released material.

For now, Grutka plans on making the
most out of his current tour, visiting cities
like Pittsburgh and hoping his message of
change will resonate.

Simkin: Two
courses of 
enjoyment

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

 

When my roommate told me she’d liketo
invite eight friends over for a multicourse
dinner featuring recipes she’d learned
studying abroad in Florence, I knew it
was going to be epic. Ifa person buys bak-
ing ingredients in amounts that threaten
to warp ﬂoorboards — i.e., 50 pounds of
flour in a single outing — you take her
seriously when she says she’s going to
bake something.

i The only possible flaw in her plan? She
was going to do all this in our tiny galley
kitchen, on a student’s budget. Was such
a feat possible? , '

A sane person would have retreated to
the safety of her bedroom and returned

when the ﬂurry of kitchen activity was

finished, but I’ve never claimed to be one
of those. So I volunteered my assistance,
comforted by the thought that if I man-
aged to make it out alive, the story might
make for a decent food column.

To. my shock and awe, the dinner wasn’t
nearly as difficult to prepare as its baf-
ﬂingly named Italian ingredients led me
to believe. I managed to doit, and yoff
absolutely can too. All of the lush and
foreign-sounding foods required were
purchased at Giant Eagle;

The Appetizer

‘J

The trickiest part of the appetizer, Pera e l

Pecorino con Miele — pears and cheese
with honey — is ﬁnding the right cheese:
pecorino romano. And even that really
isn’t that difficult. Around 1/2 a pound

of cheese and three pears served eight

people comfortably, so you can scale down‘
from there. I

Cut the pears and cheese into wedges
and drizzle them with honey. It’s that sim-
ple. Arrange individual portions on plates
or s_erve them as a sticky ﬁnger food. El-
egance, sophistication and scrumptious-
ness are yours.

Gnocchi ‘ as five or six more cups —— to form a stiff

The next step is the only slightly dif-
ficult pa.rt. Knead the dough until it’s
smooth —— about six to eight minutes —
on a ﬂoured surface. Then place the dough
in a greased bowl, cover it and allow it to
rise until its volume is about doubled. This
should take about an hour and a half.‘

Now comes possibly the most enjoyable
moment of the entire dinner—preparation
process: Punch the dough down like it’s a
belonging—stealing sibling. Then, if you’re
doing this ahead of time, pop the dough
into a Ziploc bag andstick it in the freezer.

Place the rolls on a greased baking
sheet and brush with butter and garlic
powder before baking for 15 minutes at
375 degrees. Serve with even more butter
for absolute hedonism.

If the baking-from—scratch process
doesn’t appeal to you, store—bought rolls
will be sufﬁcient. We served our dinner,
with sparkling apple juice and raspberry
iced tea. If you’re of legal age and know of
a more ﬁtting wine pairing, by all means,
trythat.

And there you have it: two courses of
a relatively easy-to-make Italian dinner.

For the main course, my roommate served

A pound comfortably serves four people.
When the pasta risesito the surface -

— it’s ﬁnished.

For the sauce, heat four cups of heavy _
cream to aboil. Reduce the heat and al-
low it to simmer for 45 minutes or until it
halves itself in volume — a bizarre thing
that cream does. Remove the’ pan from

Hafley slept in office, earned respect

After suffering a career—ending injury, Haﬂey turned to coaching and is ﬁnding success.

Haﬂey 4 1

take the traVeling—salesman approach to at-
tracting talent. He acts more like an older
brother, making players feel welcome but
giving them the sort of insights that they’re
usually shielded from. ~

Haﬂey considers this approach to be a
key aspect of fostering strong relationships
with his recruits.

“I try to be very up front with them,” Haf-
ley said. “Gradually, they begin to believe the
things‘ that I tell them. I don’t lie to them. I
don’t promise them anything. I don’t sugar-
coat anything. I’m very straightforward with
them. I like to learn a lot_about these guys, so
it’s a two-way street.”

Haﬂey’s desire to learn goes far beyond

his recruiting. He graduated from Siena _

College in New York, where he played wide
receiver. But Haﬂey raninto injury problems
numerous times, ﬁnding himself hampered
by three separate surgeries during his col-
legiate career.

Haﬂey’s football career appeared to hit
rock bottom, but his coaches at Siena saw
potential for him to succeed on the sidelines.
They had him sit up in the coach’s booth and

try his hand at assisting them. Haﬂey thor- .

oughly enjoyed the opportunity.

“I think it was from that moment on that I
knew I wanted to coach,” Haﬂey said. “I kind
of take the injury as a blessing. It ultimately
brought me to where I am today.”

The coaching Venture breathed new life
into Haﬂey’s career. He spent the 2001 sea-
son coaching running backs at Worcester

' Polytechnic Institute before performing a

smorgasbord of coaching duties at Albany
during the next four years.

After receiving his master’s degree from
Albany in 2003, he gave recruiting a shot for
the ﬁrst time during the next two seasons.

He came to Pitt in 2006 as a graduate as-
sistant. He worked tirelessly to prove himself
to the coaching staff, even sleeping at the
team’s facilities to maximize his efficiency.

“I basically gave up those two years of my
life,” Haﬂey said. _“I didn’t want to look back
at such a great door that had opened for me
through [head] coach [Dave] Wannstedt and
walk away saying that I didn’.t give it every-
thing I had, whether or not I got hired.”

Haﬂey’s tireless efforts earned him the

recruiting base in Newjersey, including players.like Dion Lewis and Ray Graham.

respect of.Pitt’s coaching staff. He was pro-
moted to hiscurrent role as secondary coach
in 2008 and has continued to impress his
superiors.

Wannstedt praises Haﬂey for his recruit-
ing prowess, but sees the young coach making
his mark in other'ways as well.

“Jeff is as strong a Voice in our defensive

‘meetings asvanyone,” Wannstedt said. “He’s

got a bright ﬁxture, there’s no question about
it.”Phil Bennett, defensive coordinator, is also
conﬁdent that Haﬂey will continue to make
strides in coaching. V V
, ‘‘He’s awesome. Don’t think for asecond
that he’s just a recruiter,” Bennett said. “He
absorbs everything you tell him, and it comes
to him. He ties things together. His growth
in my three years here is awesome. His next
step, without question, will be a coordina-
tor job.”
in the meantime, though, Haﬂey contin-
ues to ﬁnd talent in New Jersey, including
two more four—star recruits‘ who will join
the Panthers next season — multi-purpose
player Bill Belton and defensive tackle Mar-
quise Wright. I

TONY’S TOP 10

Pitt needs,
new,
unique    

traditions 

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Pitt football’s slogan this year is “My City. My
Panthers.” ‘

If they are truly my Panthers, then for my
Top 10 this week, I give you the traditions that
I wish my Panthers had —— for all sports. 4,

This list only includes things that could
actually happen, so an on-campus football
stadium and a renewed Penn State football
rivalry are ineligible.

And no, a “winning tradition” doesn’t
count.

10. Wear moustaches to everyfootball game.
No matter how you feel about Dave Warmst-

Z edt’s coaching abilities, there’s no denying the

awesomeness of his moustache. Instead of
giving free T—shirts to students who buy season
tickets (which leads to an ugly, multicolored»
student section), the tickets should just come
with one fake moustache per game.

9. A homecoming parade. How does Pitt
not have a homecoming parade? The only
homecoming off-ﬁeld tradition Pitt has is

ﬁreworks the night before the game. Hos?’

cool would a parade from the Cathedral to
Heinz Field be?

8. Sing “Sweet Caroline” at basketball
games. Let’s be honest here, “Sweet Caro-
line” is the best part of the Pitt football game?‘
day experience. Why not bring that energy

Wear animal costumes

about Pittsburgh. West Virginia has that an-
noyingly catchy “Country Roads.” Pitt needs
something like that. But as far as I know, there
aren’t many songs that mention Pittsburgh,
other than Simon 8: Garfunkel’s “America.”
So listen up, music department, and start
writing one.

6. A student section at baseball/softball

games. With the completion of the new Pe— ‘

tersen Sports Complex, there is no excuse
for students not to go to baseball and soft-
ball games. The softball team is looking to be
pretty decent this year, and the baseball team
is looking to make the NCAA Tournament. A
student section at the new ballparks would
give the Panthers an edge in every game.

5. Throwback uniforms. I haven’t met a
Pitt fan who wasn’t in favor of bringing back
the script logo for a football game. I don’t
know why it is taking so long for the athletic
department to listen. If Pitt can wear that
ridiculously epic Nike Pro Combat uniform
as a third jersey this season, why can’t it use

the script logo next year?

4. Midnight Madness. Every year, in the
middle of October, students at schools like
Duke, Connecticut and Kentucky wait in line
all day to pack the basketball arena. No, not
for a game, but for practice. The ﬁrst official
practice, to be exact. Pitt just has Fan Fest,
which is nice, but a midnight basketball prac-
tice would be a little more energized.

3. An NCAA hockey team. A few weeks ago, a

Penn_ State alumnus donated $88 million for
the construction of a new hockey rink and

an upgrade to NCAA Division 1 hockey for
the Nittany Lions. I’m more than a little jeal-
ous. And I don’t easily admit jealousy of Penn
State for anything. I’m not sure if the Pete has
hockey capabilities, but I’m sure that’s nothing
a little renovation can’t ﬁx. Pitt can’t let Robert

_ Morris and Penn State have the only Division

1 hockey programs in the state.

2. Turn Heinz Field blue and gold. Turn-
ing Heinz Field blue is nice ~—-" but like I said
earlier, some people still wear those hideous
pink shirts anyway. How cool would it be if
Heinz Field were like Iowa’s apd Boise State’s
stadiums, where each _section wears an al-
ternating color for big games. So for West
Virginia and Notre Dame, every fan should

get a T-shirt, and Heinz Field will actually feel '

like a college stadium.

1. Wear animal costumes in the Zoo. Duke

' has the best student section in college basket- V
ball. Theyalways have and they always will —

unless Pitt fans start taking the Oakland Zoo
literally. Sure, a few students come dressed
as gorillas or even Winnie the Pooh, but Pitt’s
student section — which is already among

~ the nation’s best — would skyrocket to the top

of the list if every student came dressed in a
full animal costume. Imagine how opponents
would react as they try to shoot a free throw
with an elephant and an alligator behind the
net trying to make. them miss. ,
There’s a reason this is at the top of my list.
It needs to happen. Someone should /start a
Facebook group or something. Maybe even
the athletic department can get in on it.
Halloween is coming up. So do your part,
loyal readers. Go buy an animal costume. I
