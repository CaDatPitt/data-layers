Book Exchange Opens In Alumni
Hall; Harvey Stresses Need
For Student Cooperation

By Herbert Rackoff

Vlfilliam Harvey, C36, chairman of
the executive committee of the Stu-
dent Faculty Association, indicated
yesterday the approximate course of
action which SFA would follow
throughout the year.

The activities carried on last year
by SFA will be continued at the dis-
cretion of the assembly, Harvey said.
He mentioned two ideas which he will
introduce; one, a committee to select
interviewers to discuss the University
and college life with incoming fresh-
men. In this way statistics would be
collected for the extension speakers’
program in high schools. This, Harvey
pointed out, would aid: the school in
enrolling more out-of-town students.

Another committee to be proposed
is a body to aid in improving the cam-
pus. Two of its ﬁrst problems would
be the widening of Alumni Hall Drive
to permit parking on both sides, and
the construction of steps behind
Heinz House. ‘

“Entering Crucial Year”

“SFA is entering the most crucial
year of its existence,” Harvey stated.
“Last year the assembly was in a
trial period in which criticism was
reserved, since its activities were in

more or less of an experimental
stage.
“This year, however, we will be

standing squarely on our own feet.
All that we ask is a spirit of coopera-
tion- in the -student body, so‘that,:if it
should criticize any of our projects,
it might also offer some constructive
suggestions.”

Assembly meetings will be held on
the second Tuesday of each month.
with the exception that the ﬁrst will
be held on October 1, and the second
on October 22. The October 1 meeting
will be a dinner affair with arrange-
ments to be completed by -the social
committee.

Book Exchange Opens

Opened yesterday in the furnace

room of Alumni Hall, the SFA Book
Exchange becomes the latest SFA-
sponsored activity to appear on cam-
pus. There will be no branch in the
Cathedral. A committee under the
chairmanship of Elizabeth Black,
BA36, is managing the exchange.
Other members of this committee are
Alan Lloyd, Ed36, Louis Bearer, E37,
Leo Ryan, C37, Florian Majchrzak,
E37, and Leah Stark, C36.
' Appointments to other SFA commit-
tees were completed by executive com-
mittee representatives yesterday. The
appointments committee, which inter-
views all applicants for dance chair-
manships and other appointive cam-
pus positions, has Charles Allcroft,
C36, as chairman, with Marcella Ley-
ton, C36, James Nicholas, E36, Har-
vey Goldstein_ C37, William Churchill.
C37, and Robert Ayars, professor of
accounting as aides. The appoint-
ments committee endeavors to choose
from the applicants 011 the basis of
worth as opposed to that of political
preference.

The social committee includes VVil-
liam McQuade, E36, as chairman,
with Sylvia Fixel, C36, Charles Ebert,
C36, Leo Ryan, C37, Betty Glass, C36,
James Ballantyne, C36, and Miss Isa-
belle Anderson, assistant dean of
women, as members. The social com-
mittee prepares a social calendar of
University events, and passes upon
all proposed University and fraternity
social events.

The men’s customs committee, a
newly organized body with ﬂexible
powers, includes Charles Herald, C36,
chairman, and George Strong, Ed36,
William Blair, BA37, Edward Lincoln.
Ed37, and Peter Noon, C36. ‘Not
judiciary, ‘but a ‘regulative body, the
group will control the administration
of the new freshman men’s customs
system.

Abbreviations Followed
By Pitt News Explained

There has been some confusion on
the part of freshmen and transfer
students in interpreting the symbols
used by The Pitt News to designate
the names of the various schools of
the University. For their con-
venience, the following list is pub-
lished: College, C; Business Ad-
ministration, BA; Education, Ed;
Engineering, E; Mines, M; Medicine,
Med; Law, L; Dentistry, D; Phar-
macy, Ph; Graduate, G; Petroleum

Reﬁning, P.

Subdivisions in Engineering are
designated thus: Aeronautical, AE;
Industrial, IE; Mechanical, ME;

Chemical, ChE; Civil, CE: Electrical.
EE. Students’ class standing are in-
dicated by the numbers of the year
in which they graduate, thus: senior
in the College, C36.

Markley Awarded
Chi Rho Nu Plaque

Pre-Medical Group Announces
Season ’s Plans At Smoker

Markley,

William, Med39, was
awarded a plaque in recognition of
outstanding scholastic achievement

during the past year at the annual
smoker for freshman pre—medical stu-
dents held last Wednesday at the Y
Hut.

The plaque was presented by Rob-
ert Churchill, C37, president of Chi
Rho Nu, honorary pre—medical frater-
nity which sponsored the smoker.

The award goes annually to the
outstanding pre—medical student who
has averaged 2.5 or above for the
past year.

Churchill announced that the fra-
ternity will sponsor a drive to have
all pre—medical students sit in one
block at football games, in order to
promote more friendly relations
among them. Plans were also an-
nounced for a series of informal lec-
tures to be addressed by practicing
physicians and members of the
School of Medicine faculty.

Chi Rho Nu will sponsor a fall ini-

tiation and rushing smoker in the
near future, and a dance in the
spring.

Dr. Omar C. Held, personnel as-

sistant to the dean of the College,
will continue to act as adviser for
the coming year. Oflicers in addition

to Ghurchill are Kenneth Clark,
Med39, vice president; Allen Simp-
son, M.ed39, secretary; and James

Dornenburg, C37, treasurer.

At.the smoker the students were

Old, New Members Will Attend
Meeting, Register For Year

Pitt Players’ ﬁrst general meeting,
which all students wishing to try
out for the season’s productions must
attend, will ' take place tomorrow
evening at 8:15 o'clock in Room 315,

bers register within the scheduled
times as there will be no further try-
outs until after Christmas.

ductions on the Players’ schedule,
one, “Candida” by George Bernard
Shaw. may not be given. Miss Kath-
erine Cornell may present it at the

The Nights Are Getting
Colder There, Dale

By Ray Mclntyre

“No, I shouldn’t like to be in-
carcerated in Zelienop1e’s new jail,
even if it does have running
water a.nd other modern conven-
iences,” declared Dale Van Or-
mer, E37, as he sat dejectedly on
the curbstone in front of the Ca-
thedral yesterday. Dale was pon-
dering over the possibility of be-
ing returned on suspicion of burg-
lary to the old constable with the
pointed beard who always sat on
the pickle barrel in the Zelienople
Emporium.

, A complaint against Van Ormer
has been lodged by. the downtown
Y authorities after discovery late
yesterday of an infamy perpe-
trated during the Freshman Camp
session. Van Ormer swears he is
innocent. '

University authorities _disavow
all responsibility in the matter.

So will the freshman who bor-
rowed the keys to the boathouse
at Camp Kon-O-Kwee kindly 1‘e-
turn them to Dale Van Ormer at

the Y Hut?

Continue Orientation Plans

Men Inaugurate Entirely
New Student-Faculty
Cooperation '

Inaugurating the new system of
men’s freshman orientation, the ini-
tial meeting of the ﬁrst-year classes
with the upperclass counselors and
faculty advisers was held yesterday.
A similar session will follow tomor-
row.

The purpose of these meetings is to
familiarize the new students with
University traditions and to assist
them in problems of study and voca-
tional aims. 

At the freshman banquet held last
Thursday night Vvilliam Harvey, SFA
executive chairman,

stated ﬁg
purpose ‘ of the traditions A perio‘ 

Green and white “PITT” pins were
given to each freshman. After a two

or three week period a test will be[
"given, requiring a knowledge of the

branches of the University, its history,
the names of the deans of the schools,
at least ﬁve cheers, and the following
University songs: “Panther Song,”
“Hail to Pitt,” “The Victory Chant,”

"and “Alma Mater.”

A passing grade on the examination
will entitle the freshman to a perma-
nent pin bearing the class numerals,
’39. This insignia must be worn dur-
ing the traditions period, which ends
with a freshman jamboree shortly be-
fore Thanksgiving. No high school
insignia is to be worn by freshmen
during this time.

“Traditions period should be wel-
comed by all new men as an oppor-
tunity to learn to know Pitt,” said
Charles Herald, C36, chairman of cus-
toms committee. “At the conclusion
of this period, it is likely that the
freshman class will be fully accli-
mated to the University, with a new
ﬁeld of college life open to them.”

Symphony Orchestra Calls
Candidates For Membership

Under the leadership of Lee M.
Lockhart, director of the University
Band and Orchestra, the Symphony
Orchestra will consider candidates
for membership tomorrow in Room
728, Cathedral, between 4:30-5:30 and
7200-8 o’clock, and on Thursday of
next week from 6:30-7:30 o’clock.
The Orchestra, boasting 65 to 70
pieces, includes ensemble and cham-
ber units.

Members of the Orchestra of last
year will meet for rehearsal from
7:30 to 9 o’clock next Thursday in the
same room. '

Coeds Will Attend Revised
Courses For Learning

Ways Of Campus

Freshman women will begin the
newly revised college orientation
class tomorrow at 1:30 o’clock under
the direction of Miss 'I‘hyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women. At this ﬁrst
meeting Miss Amos will speak to all
freshman women on the purpose of
the course. In subsequent meetings
the women will convene in small dis-
cussion groups of 25, each of which
will be in charge of a regular mem-
ber of the faculty.

This plan of having small dis-
cussion groups with regular faculty
as instructors developed out of last
year’s experiment in which large lec-
ture classes and small discussion
groups were used interchangeably on
taitei-irate: ‘weeks. :-'The~a‘dvisa~bility- of
the smaller groups was proved to
such an extent that this year the
larger lecture sessions have been dis-
1 continued.

The second innovation is the change
in the hour at which the course is
scheduled from 8:30 to 1:30 o’clock in
the afternoon. The course, similar to
that of previous years, will deal with
problems of adjustments to Univer-
sity life.

Facult.y and administrative oﬂicers
in charge of the course will be: Miss
Amos, director of the course; Helen
P. Rush, assistant dean of women;
lsa.belle S. Anderson, assistant dean
of women; Dr. Auleene ,M. Jamison,
director of the student health service
for women; Elizabeth C. Rearick,
head of the women’s physical educa-
tion department; Dr. Lotte Lohs-
toeter, assistant professor of modern
languages; Helen C. Battrick, execu-
tive secretary of the YWCA; Dorcas
C. Ll-Iall, graduate assistant in the dean
of women’s office; Theresa Kahn, in-
lstructor in English; Dr. Plorence
Teagarden, professor of psychology.

152 Juniors Enter  
Education School

New Term Marks Second Use
Of Admission Tests

 

 

One hundred ﬁfty-two of the stu-
dents who applied for admission to

‘ the School -of Education last -Spring

met the requirements and were ad-
mitted this year to the School, ac-
cording to Theodore A. Siedle, assist-
ant to the dean. In all, 167 applica-
tions were made.

The 15 who were eliminated were
advised to transfer to another de-
partment of the University.

Those admitted will specialize in
11 various subject ﬁelds in secondary
education, and in elementary, com.
mercial, and physical education. They
will be classiﬁed as juniors in the
School of Education.

This year marks the second appli-
cation of the selective plan of ad-
mission. Applicants were required
to meet standards of superior rating
in intelligence, average or better
scholarship in all subjects, grades of
B or better in the major ﬁeld, satis-
factory health rating, superior ability
in the use of written and oral Eng-
lish, and a personal interview with
the admissions committee of faculty
members.

“The new teacher preparation pro-

gram is not designed to eliminate stu- .

dents.” said Mr. Siedle; “Its chief
purpose is to ‘produce "a better—trained
teacher.”

Tea Dances And War Clouds

'1‘ IS VERY unlikely that the College Associa-
tion’s tea dance this afternoon will be any less
gay an affair simply because a crisis_is nearing

in the set-up of European events. \Vith energy
and freshness renewed by a long vacation, and
with the darkness of summer suntaiis still on their
faces, the tea dancers should be a happy and care-
free lot, not at all perturbed about Haile Selassie
and his Ethiopians or Benito Mussolini and his
demands.

Nevertli-eless, there -are appearing every day
more circumstances which bring the European ket-
tle closer to the boiling point. Mussol1ni’s recent
refusal to accept terms ‘prescribed by the League
of Nations puts the dictator in a. position from
which he cannot easily back down in the sight_of
his countrymen. Meanwhile Great Britain, which
not many months ago was looking only fairly in-
tently froiii the balcony upon the show around the
Mediterranean, has come rushing down to occupy
a reserved seat in the orchestra.

Newspapers are presenting columns of facts and
ﬁgures, uncovering all sorts of comparisons in re-
gard to ﬁghting, strength of possible belligerents,
and listing possibilities and probabilities in the
manner with which. the.sports_ pages forecast ‘a
heavyweight championship boxing bout. But in
these comparisons not many of them neglect to men-
tion the fact that Serajevo seemed as  removed
from this country in 1914 as Ethiopia is today.

At VVasliington last week there was formally es-
tablished a division in the State Department to be
known as “the office of arms and munitioiis con-
trol.” This new office will be charged with regu-
lating the arms and munitionsindus-t.ry and, in
particular, will control the exports of arms and
munitions, through a license system. _

It has been emphasized that the new organiza-
tion has no direct relation to the European crisis.
If trouble should start, the system of making a reg-
istered license necessary before a shipment of arms
could leave the country would add an additional
check to the President ’s arms embargo against the
warring nations, which he is obligated to place
under the neutrality law.

That should help. It has always seemed very
hard for the fellow in one corner of a ring to main-
tain an even feeling toward the fellow who is tying
on his oppoiient’s gloves in the opposite corner.
Let us hope then that the European difficulty shall
be conﬁned to Europe, and that there shall be no
war-time pall cast over University tea dances to-
day, next week, or next year.

Just One More Credit

HAT VVAS A STATEMENT made often during regis-

tration proceedings last week, “Just one more credit.”
That statement was used, it is learned, when a great
many students reach a point in scheduling their classes
where they ﬁnd themselves signed up for 14 credits.
Immediately a frantic hunt is begun to locate the 15th
credit, and the student soon ﬁnds that the open season
for oiie-credit courses is not on and that the hunting
grounds are rather sparse.

Courses giving only one credit are not very satisfac-
tory, it may be true. But so long as there is a general
requirement of the University which makes it necessary
for a student to be registered for 15 credits before re-
ceiving an athletic book, then steps ought to be taken to
provide more openings for those seeking the single credit
course to round out a schedule.

The added hardship resulting from courses which meet
by appointment and other systems of unusual arrange-
ment is undoubtedly something of a burden to professors
and instructors. Be that as it may, it seems no more
than proper that the curriculum committees might well
consider now the problems of the student, especially the
uppérclassmen, who run into a lot of grief chasing the
final credit.

Most of the courses being offered are available only to
advanced students or are concerned merely with the lec-
tures of a three or four-credit course. There appears
to be a lot of room and a lot of demand for the one-
credit classes.

Of course, there is always a neat little subject listed
as “G1ass Manipulation, 1 credit.” Upon investigation
this turns out to be a class in glass-blowing. Now Pitts-
burgh has always been noted for its high position in the
matter of glass manufacturing, and the art may be one
well worthwhile. But it certainly would be monotonous
to have a June graduating -‘class march out of the Sta-
dium, each graduate being a capable glass blower. The
idea, then, should be to develop a few more one—credit
courses for such people as English and history majors
who never attempted blowing anything other than soap
bubbles.

A Letter For You?

T SOME TIME IN EVERY boy’s life there comes the
desire to earn a college‘ or university letter in ath-
letics. Generally, by the time he reaches college age
that yearning for a letter in athletics has been replaced
by a desire for the healthy body and quick mind which
athletics are intended to develop.

Whether it be for the glory of a letter or for the de-
velopment of a more healthy body, men at the Univer-
sity have an opportunity to compete on some of the
ﬁnest teams in the country and to work under the coach-
ing direction of men who are very close to the top in
their respective sports.

Football and track are the current sports to which
newcomers are invited, Pitt football is known through-
out the length and breadth of the land; to play on a
University of Pittsburgh team is an honor. Successes
that have come to former University gridiron stars prove
that their sports’ training has been worthwhile. There
is only one door through which a Pitt man may enter

varsity football. That is by way of the freshman team. .

The University's track teams have become more and
more strong during each of Coach Carl Olson's three
years here. Participation in track does 3.1-3t require near-
ly so rugged or so large a physical make-up as does foot-
ball, although the beneﬁts derived from track competi-
tion are equally worthwhile. No matter what his size
or weight, any boy is welcome to try out for the track
team and receive the coaching advice of one of the
foremost instructors in the country.

A degree and a varsity letter make a rather ﬁne com-
bination to show as results of four years of coliege life.
A good mind and a healthy body are better yet.

Athletes’ Marks

Surpass Grades
Of Fraternities

Pitt athletes proved their versa-
tility in classroom activities by rais-
ing their quality point average to
1.354 for a new high during last
semester.

The high light of the averages
shows that “Jock" Sutherland‘s grid-
men climbed from an average of
1.146 for the group in February to

1.428 in June. Four gridders placed
their names on the honor roll, the
foursome being composed of Miller
Munjas and Doc Hartwig, All-Ameri-
cans and both repeaters on the honor
roll, and Walter Balasia and Earl
McCue.

The tennis team, with an average
of 1.460, replaced the swimming
squad as the leading sport academ-
ically. Second place honors went to
the football squad, which was fol-
lowed in order named by boxing with
1.425; track with 1.354; basketball
with 1.349; riﬂe with 1.339; swimming
with 1.287; wrestling with 1.115; and
golf with 1.098.

It is interesting to note that the all-
athlete average is higher than the all-
fraternity average. The athletes
compiled an average of 1.354 as com-
pared to the Greek’s average of 1.296.

Individual honors for last semes-
ter’s athletes went to Bill Albright of
Bellevue, whose average of 2.77
topped all other athletes’ individual
marks, and placed his name on the
honor roll for the ﬁfth time in six
semesters.

Charles Hartwig, 1934 football cap-
tain, placed his name on the honor
roll for the ﬁfth time in six semesters,
and Arvel Fleming, track star, had
his name go on the list of the 20

Freshman Eleven
Rounds Into Form

Milligan Wants -More Candidates;
35 Now Working Out Daily

Freshman football candidates are
gradually rounding into shape under
the tutelage of Coach Milligan on the
Trees practice ﬁeld. With some 35
men aspiring for positions on the
yearling eleven the call is still out for
ﬁrst-year men.

Daily practice sessions start at 3:30
o'clock on schooldays, continuing for
approximately three hours. Any after-
noon this week candidates for both
team and managerial positions should
report to the Stadium where cards
may be secured and equipment is-
sued.

The Frosh eleven will open the sea-
son with the Tartan pledges from
Carnegie Tech on Saturday, October
12, at Tech. The Schenley Park boys,
with a wealth of outstanding second-
ary school players of last season, will
be formidable in the opener role with
the little Panthers.

Goldberg, former -Elkins, West Vir-
ginia ace, and Steggins, Williams-
port-prepped halfback, continue to
stand out’ in the backﬁeld department.
Sabitch from Wilkes-Barre looks
strong at tackle.

Panthers Prepare
For Waynesburg

Game Saturday

Wolf To Bring Promising Eleven;
Shedlosky Sparkles In Final
Intra.-Squad Camp Clash

Vi/'ith the ﬁrst hurdle of the 1935
football season only three days away,
Coach Jock Sutherlands sun-tanned
gridders buckled down to serious work
for the opening game against Coach
Frank Wolf's Waynesburg outﬁt on
Saturday.

Although the Yellow Jacket’s ranks
for this season were riddled by grad-
uation losses, Coach Wolf will bring
to Pittsburgh an eleven which prom-
ises to give the Panthers a stiff open-
ing day encounter.

Losing such stars as Rab Currie,
Billy Paul, Tom Holland, Andy Sepsi,
Jim Conroy, anzl Ross McCracken,
Coach Wolf has been forced to develop
a teamgmade up for the most _part
with sophomores and juniors. His
starting lineup for Satr.rday’s game
will probably include ﬁve sophomores,
four juniors, and two seniors.

At ends for the Wolfpack will be
Wasko and Parker. Wasko, a junior,
was a reserve last season and appears
to have his varsity berth clinched.

He weighs 174 pounds. At the other
terminal position one of the two sen-
iors on the squad, Don Parker, will
start.

Bill Cummins, a sophomore, and Joe
McCune, will hold down the tackle
posts. Both these men are 180-pound-
ers. Replacements for these two grid-
alers will come from Bob Coen, a vet-
eran of three seasons, and Pete
Brown.

IFor guards Coach VVolf will call
upon Al Jones, 1934 regular, and Guy
Tornabene, the other senior on the
team. Charles Richnafsky, John Sulli-
van, Fred Bartoletti, and Romeo Ron-
co form the reserve group for the
guard jobs.

A promising sophomore, Don Avery,
will be used at center. His alternate
for the post is Glenn ll-Iarshman, a
freshman.

Waynesburg Misses Currie

Coach Wolf lost a real halfback
threat in the diminutive Rab Currie
but still has a couple of ﬁrst-rate ball
carriers in Jim Worden and Bill Mc-
Glumphy, a pair of sophomores to ﬁll
in at halfbacks. Arnold Koepke, at
quarterback, and Bob Criss, at full-
back, round out Coach Wolf’s back-
ﬁeld. Red McCombs, regular fullback,
was injured in training drills and will
probably be withheld from the Pitt
game.

The Panther gridders returned
from Camp Hamilton late Saturday
afternoon after spending two weeks
in the mountains-at Windber, Pa. In
the ﬁnal intra-squad game played on
Saturday morning, the varsity eleven
kept its training camp slate clear by
defeating the reserves, 14-0, Leon
Shedlosky, veteran halfback, gave the
several hundred spectators watching
the game a treat with his ﬁne ball-
carrying.

While Coach Sutherland has select-
ed no starting lineup as yet, it appears
as though the two sophomore Franks,
Souchak and Patrick, have Won var-
sity berths at left end and fullback,
respectively. Two other sophomores,
George Delich at tackle, and Dante
Dalle-Tezze at guard, continue to
hold the edge over the other candi-
dates for these two posts. Art Detzel,
veteran tackle, who missed a few days
of camp training, has been coming
along at a fast pace and may nose out
Delich —

With Verne Baxter temporarily out
of action due to an injury, Coach
Sutherland has been using Eddie
Quarantillo at right end and Leon
Shedlosky h_as taken over Bob La-
Rue’s post at halfback. LaRue is also
on the injured list.

Arnold Greene continues to have
first call at the signal-barking job and
{Hub Randour will probably get the
starting assignment at left halfback.

The remainder of the probable var-
sity eleven includes Ave Daniell, jun-
ior letterman, at tackle, Nick Klisky,
husky senior, at center, and Bill Glass-
ford, at guard.

Seventeen Men Report To Olson"

For Cross-Country Tryouts _

Minus the services of three crack
cross-country runners, Head Coach
Carl Olsen will have to build virtually
an entire new team for the 1935 sea-
son.

Gone are Charley Kirpkatrick, Sen-
ior AMA champion for the past year,
Ken Wagenhouser, '33 AMA title-hold-
er, and Bill Albright, three of the
ﬁnest cross—country runners in Pan-
ther history. Only Sam Musico and
Red Tost remain from last season's
National Junior champions.

However, with six varsity squad
members returning, in addition to nine
sophomore prospects from the frosh
ranks, Olsen will have a nucleus from
which to develop his ﬁrst ﬁve runners.
Musico, who holds the record for the
four-mile Navy course with a mark
of 19 minutes and 36 seconds, and
Tost, lettermen, are virtually assured
of positions in the select group of
ﬁve. Charley Groat, half-mile record
holder at the University, Alex Leggin,
other likely
prospects. ,

Other former varsity squad mem-
bers in the running are J. Albright,
Harold Connelly, and H. Walmsley.
Sophomore candidates trying for their
initial berth on the varsity include
Franklin Theriault, Ray Northrop,
Ray Nordstrom, Pencis, Crawford,
James Van Kennan, Jim McConnell,
and Heller. Edmunds, a senior is al-
so making his ﬁrst bid for a varsity
position.

On October 19, the Panther hill-and-
dalers will travel to South Bend for
a dual with the consistently-strong
Notre Dame runners. On the 26th,
Penn State, only victor over Pitt in
seven meets during the past season,

wisdom to the gridiron backﬁeld as-
pirants, Charley Bowser is no
stranger to Blue and Gold athletics.

As a varsity pigskin performer, he
earned his letter in 1920, ’21, and '22,
and was acting captain in his ﬁnal
campaign. Following graduation he
went to -Grove City College as an as-
sistant coach.

Taking over the reins in 1924, he
had a lean year during his initial sea-
son, but achieved considerable suc-
cess in his next two years by produc-
ing Class “B” champions and winding
up the 1926 session without a defeat.
His ﬁrst return to the familiar haunts
of his undergraduate days was made
in 1927.

Dr. Zehfuss, who was one of the
ﬁnest court performers in Pitt
history during his undergraduate days,
was promoted to assistant varsity
basketball coach under Dr. H. C. Carl-
son, popular head coach. “Poison
Paul,” as he was known to his team-
mates, was one of the best “ball chas-
ers” and team players in collegiate
ranks.

Zehfuss coached the Pitt freshman

Concerning The Candy Stand Story-—
From Fudge To Fancy Confectionery

 

Maybe you thought that like the
river the YWCA candy stand has gone
on forever. You’re wrong. Long ago
there was no glass case to shelter
your peanut bar from the menace of
ﬂies, germs, and unscrupulous students.
There were only a girl and a candy-
box and a handful or so of home-made
pieces of fudge. That's the way the
YVV of yesterday collected its money
-—homem_ade candy. Later they start-
ed cafeteria lunches, which members
and interested faculty wives brought
in boxes from home and served on
the arms of chairs in the old physics
lecture room in Thaw Hall. The wild-
est estimate of proﬁt for that ﬁrst'
venture was $25; they made $40.
During the years of 1927, 28, and 29,
the candy stand netted $2,500 a year.
Could Mrs. S. B. McCormick, who
mothered the idea of the lunches see
the candy stand as it standsnow, with
the crowds of students jostling after
their chocolate bars, she would be
very much amazed. The stand has
taken on all the outer aspects of an

Mortar Board Plans
Fall Rummage Affair

Mortar Board, senior womeii’s hon-
orary activities fraternity, is planning
a rummage sale, the date of which
will be announced in the near future.

At a recent diinier meeting held at
Heinz House, Martha Marsh, Ed,
chairman of the service committee,
and Margaret Chalmers, -Ed, chair-
man of the alumnae committee, spoke
about more eﬂicient contact with
Mortar Board alumnae and with the
Quarterly, Mortar Board’s national
publication.

Miss Thyrsa VV, Amos, dean of
women, addressed the group concerii-
ing Mortar Board as an aid to the
Parents’ Council.

Future undertakings of the group
were discussed, and among the
projects planned are an alumni card
ﬁle to be prepared by members and a.
system of alternating committees to
be responsible for supper meetings
a.iid programs. The next meeting will
be held on Thursday, October 17.

Ofﬁcers of the organization are
Ruth Seitz, BA, president; Anna June
Elmer, C, vice president and social
chairman; Maxine Hirsch, C, secre-
ta.ry; and Margaret Speer, Ed, treas-
urer.

Lantern Rehearsal

 

Rehearsals for the Lantern Night
ceremony will be held today in Heinz
House at 12:30 o’clock and again at
3:30 o’clock on the Thaw Hall lawn.

All members of the WSGA Coni-
mission, traditions committee of
WSGA, and Cwens are asked to be
pre_sent.

intricate organization. The chairman,
Ruth Raup, Ed37, appoints girls to
sell for every hour of the day; the
cashier, Betty Brown, C36, receives a
salary for counting out changeand
standing over the cash-box. The treas-
urei°’s office of the University aids the
girls in making out the accounts and
keeping the books straight. And the
sales girls themselves form a battery
which answers questions and dispen-
ses candy.

Time was when candy lay under a
heavy ban here. That was when the
medical department rose up in righte-
ous anger against the number of stu-
dents who lived through their days
here on diets of candy lunches. Ini-
mediately the YW took steps, and for
many a weary week the students who
came for candy went away with crack-
ers and milk, the only food they could
buy at the stand. But once more the
students asserted themselves, and
now Miss Brown says that the busiest
hour is ﬁfth, a.nd the most-called-for
item is chocolate bars.

Women Of 1939
Favor Teaching

Over Chiropody

The world may change, but appar-
ently the college wonian’s aspirations
don’t. This year’s crop of‘ freshman
women ‘has, according to the vocation-
al choices indicated in a Heinz House
questionnaire, practically the same
ambitions as last year’s. Again almost
a third of the class want to be teach-
ers, with social service running a
poor second, and journalism and busi-
ness just about tying for third place.

Unless some thorough changing of
minds is done within the next four
years, 98 would-be schoolmarms will
be uiiloosed on the educational world
in 1939, along with 35 social workers,
14 (the same number as last year)
journalists, and a sprinkling of doc-
tors, lawyers, dieticians, and librari-
ans. The University’s new govern-
ment service course has ﬁve prospec-
tive members in the female half of
the class of 1939.

And, as last year, the class has its
one future chiropidist, this time in
company with one museum worker, an
interpreter, and a young lady who
wantsto enter “any of the professions
relating to the building and housing
business.” Of the class of 238, 14
simply coiildn’t make up their minds
what they intended to do.

Panhel Council Meets

The Panhelleiiic Council will meet
Thursday evening at Heinz House at
7 o’clock. Following a discussioii of
affairs of the year, refreshments will
be served.

Final Tryouts For Choral
To Take Place This Week

Today and Friday will be the last
two days for tryouts for students in-

Those who have colds or for some
other good reason a.re unable to try

diately with Mrs. Robert D. Ayars,
director of the choral, for appoint-
ments at some other time, since the
membership of the Choral is limited
to from 50 to 55 members.

“However,” says Mrs. Ayars, “if
l’ve just ﬁnished choosing 50 men‘-
bers and ﬁnd" one more golden voice,
I’ll try to make room for it.”
