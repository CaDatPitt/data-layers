a state park. Dum de dum. Okay,
time"s up. Odds are you picked
someplace like Moraine or Wash-
ington's Crossing or Tobyhanna:

If you did, take 10 points off your
SAT’s because you haven’t realized
you’re in Pittsburgh yet.

Pittsburgh is practically devoid
of lakes and woods and squeaky‘
water pumps, so you've got to stop
thinking of places like Raccoon,
Keystone, and Promised Land.

We have our ownistate park only
three miles from Pitt, where the
Allegheny, Monongahela, and
Ohio Rivers ” meet to make
Pittsburgh Pittsburgh.

It's built on the resulting triangle
or point of land, and it's called
Point State Park.

At first glance it doesn't look like
a state park. Just a large grassy
area in front of some chrome
buildings with a walkway leading
under a gracefully curving over-_

I pass covering a stone inlaid pool.

Walk under the overpass and it
still doesn’t look like a state park.
It doesn’t have a campground. It

‘doesn’t have a beach. It doesn’t
have any nature trails. ~ \
However. there might be a

symphony orchestra playing on a
barge tied to its wharf area, or
there might be water skiers braving
the murky waters to put on their
own kind of show. .

. fascinating history. _Tn addition,

the city boasts a surprising number
of “world records.”

This uniqueness is noticeable
even at Pitt, whose Cathedral of
Learning is presently _the world's
tallest university building.

The’ Oakland-Shadyside area
surrounding Pitt offers a number of
varied activities withinwalking or
biking distance of the University.

Concerts
Oakland are most frequently held

at the Syria Mosque, half a block

from the Cathedral on Bigelow
Boulevard. The Mosque’s rather
strange appearance stems fromthe

circumstances under_ which it was”

built. The building’s Arabic
architecture and decorative Koran
scripts were determined by the
Mystic Nobles of Pittsburgh--a
society of Freemasons--who—built it
for $750,000 in 1916 for the secret

Before the ‘renovation project"

which cleaned and renovated
downtown‘ Pittsburgh, Oakland was

known as the cultural center of the 1

city. The Mosque, the Memorial,
the now-defunct Pittsburgh Play-
house, and Carnegie Library,
Museum, and Music Hall were all
located in the area. The library and
museum, across Forbes Avenue
from the Cathedral, are still the
largest and best in the City.

The building housing the mu-

seum, ‘library, and music hall was
first built in 1890, when Andrew /

Carnegie offered the city $1 million
to build it, on the condition that the
citywould maintain it. ’ The ,library
is still “Free to the People',”' as
Carnegie’s inscription over the
door decrees. The museum is free
to alfon Saturdays, but costs.$1.00
for adults and $.50 for, children all
other days, exeept Monday, when
it is closed. The Library is open 9

am to 9 pm Monday through_

Friday, and 9 am to 5 pm on
Saturday.

One of Oakland's most unique
resources is Phipps Conservatory,
across Panther Hollow Bridge from
the library. The conservatory is a
huge hothouse, containing rooms
full of strange varieties oftropical
and desert plants. There is no
admission charge, and the building

is built on the highly probable
premise that dorm foqd gets fairly
disgusting in a very short time.

The immediate area around our .

hallowed halls is choked with a
plethora of restaurants ranging
from the sublime to the ridiculous,
with something somewhere to
placate both a student's stomach
and,budget.

The most “traditional” spot
around town is the Original, a shop
on Forbes and Bouquet that started
as a humble hot dog stand and has
grown’ to include a larger menu
under its “Beef and Brew” banner.

What makes the Original so
popular is not just the wide variety
of sandwiches but the availability
of beer, even on Sunday.

According to Vrana, who was a
junior when the circular structures
opened in 1963, the" Towers
operates on a break-even budget.

“Students who live here should
receive the benefits they pay for,"
Vrana said, pointing out that room

employees wages, renovations, and

In addition to citing the

“This is community living,”
Vrana said. “Student life centers
around the residence halls and

place to meet people and make
friends.” ,

Vrana added that, partly due to

last fall, more residents than ever

people——their close neighbors.

But what about the cost? This
may be a problem Vrana over-
looked. Budget minded students,
the kind who might substitute
powdered instead of fresh milk,
may be interested in shopping for
substitute housing.

For example, according to the
files of the Off Campus Housing
Office located‘ in the Towers lobby.
which assists students interested in
non-dormitory living, rooms can be
obtained in homes near the
University at $40 per month and
up.
When this is contrasted with
private dorm housing rates. which
are $475 per term (or approxi-
mately $155 p.er month) a student
could easily save $300 a term for
basic housing.

Then there are double rooms
where two roommates cheerfully
pay the University $850 [$425 each]
per term to_live in a single room.

month.

New Orleans, looking for more
steel and helping make Pittsburgh
one of the busiest ports in the
country.

Oh. you don't feel like romanti-
cizing about carp and fountains and
barges? How about history?

The Point was the site of two
major forts that helped get the
country started the way it did. and
they've got the remnants to prove
lt. ‘
That strange looking five-sided
block house just happens to be an
original part of Fort'Pitt and the
oldest structure in Western Penn-

sylvania.
Next to it is the Fort Pitt
Museum, built right inot a

facsimile of the original British
fort‘s bastion. Inside is a scale
model of the Point during the
1760's. with every imaginable
detail complete. Other exhibits
include a full scale log cabin of the
time and a cutaway of the soldier's
quarters. (with two of the redcoats
shooting craps).

Outside, between the museum
and the fountain is a stone outline
of the earlier French Fort Du-
quesne, with stones also marking
the old shoreline, quite different
from today’s perfectly symmetriacl
one.

Look, even if you're not a
romantic and a historian. and all
you like to do is throw frisbees
around, get on one of the 70's
buses. (Negley, Hamilton, High-

Everybody has a leader. Ethiopia
has its emperor, England has its
queen, and Pitt has Chancellor
Wesley Posvar.

The Chancellorship at Pitt has
always been occupied by outstand-
ing and talented persons. It was
from the administration of John
Bowman that the Cathedral of
Learning emerged as did the

I

Towers under Edward Litchﬁeld for
instance.
It is an office which demands a

strong hand in leadership to run

the State’s second largest univer-
sity while at the same time
requiring the ﬂexibility in spirit
needed to deal with the creative
energies and varied opinions of
over 30,000 people on the way up.

was the man for the job.
Graduating ﬁrst in his class at
West Point in 1946, Pitt’_s chief
administrator became a Rhodes
Scholar at Oxford University in
England where he received both
bachelors and masters degrees in
Philosophy, Politics, and Econom-
ics. ,
That wasn‘t enough for Posvar
however, because in

received a 'Master in Public

Administration _and a PhD in‘
Political"Science from Harvard.

Nor did Posvar’s achievements
go unrecognized. In 1959, he was
named one of the Ten Outstanding
Young‘ Men in the US by the
National J'aycees. '

Posvar was born in Topeka,
Kansas in 1925, but received his
early education in Cleveland where
his father was a newspaperman,

Later he rose to the rank of colonel.

in the Airforce and co-piloted a

C-54 in,the Berlin Airlift.

The Chancellor has been known
to ride as a passenger in Pitt's
Road Racing car, climbing our
through the window to the cheers
of thousands of football fans at Pitt
Stadium. Also, students have had
to look twice as the man pedaling

his bicycle along Shadyside streets

turned out to be their chancellor.

Although Posvar was selected by
the Board of Trustees, the buck

College students- have been
described as “cool” towards
politics and social-oriented prob-
lems in the wake of the militant
activity of the 60’s.

At Pitt however, large numbers
of students ‘are still actively
pursuing change in our cultural and
political institutions. The entire
.spectrum of social philosophy is
represented on campus and open
for your participation.

POLITICAL

‘ Involved with the traditional
_American parties are the College
Young Democrats [CYD] and
College Young Republicans [CYR],
iwith aims of working within these
‘institutions to inject a youthful
iewpoint.

" Pitt’s CYD, is the strongest
chapter in Pennsylvania with an
estimated membership of some
-365, according to state-wide CYD
president Betty Nelson.

9 “The main purpose,’ Nelson
said “is to foster political involve-
ment within the Democratic party.
Our main goals as an organization
"are voter registration absentee
balloting and political education.

“We're trying to inform the
 students that they can run for
office, and that they can have an
impact in the nation."

Pitt's CYD has members which
have run for positions within the
Democratic party especially at the
local level.

“Many CYD members ran for
committeemen and committee-

9

*woman positions," Nelson said.

“lt’s the lowest post in the
,'Democratic party, but it's closest to
the people."

The CYD is involved in all levels
of the Democratic organization,
-‘local, county, state and national,
according to Nelson.

Pitt CYD offices on campus are
located at 318 Student Union (SU)
and phone number is 624-5945.

-. While the traditional Republican
party structure is reeling from the
effects of Watergate, Pitt's CYR
president Doug Yauger still finds
support for the basic tenets of GOP
philosophy which he describes as
' “less government.”

“Our purpose as a student
organization is to inform people,
we want to serve as an information
clearing house," Yauger stated.

_ There is basically no difference

in the “groups controlling either
major national party, with “Big

Money” deeply involved in both

. Republican and Democratic ma-

_j . chinery, according to the CYR

‘” v president.

“I don’t see the difference,
Besides,’ with the genera] rush to
the Democratic party there are
‘A . more openings for young people in
the Republican party,” Yauger
said.

. "As I said before, the basic
principle of the party is less
government, with more importance
placed on the individual.

Pitt’sl CYR has been involved
locally in the Arsenal Center
debate, in the election of Hi. John
Heinz III and in non-partisan
educational seminars for the
University student body.

Pitt’s CYR is located in 318 SU

, and phone number is 624-5945,

for a Democratic Society (SDS) and
the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA).

Opposed to totalitarian gov-
ernmental systems which rob the
individual of freedom of choice, the
YAF was formed “to advance our
viewpoint. We believe in the
individual as the most important
unit of society, the individual right
to choose freely,” said YAF
Western Pennsylvania Chairman
Dave Washington. '

The YAF organization, according
to Washington, is admittedly
conservative, viewing detente as
“a _ sell-out” and opposing en-
croachment by welfare-oriented
political systems.

“We operate on the ideological
level and on a practical level. The
only way to get something done is
through the system. You can talk
all you want to.” Richard
Meritzer, YAF president said the
organization offers great latitude
for “personal expression."

“We're against authoritarian
government," Meritzer said,

"even if it be the pseudo-demo-
cratic government we've got in this
country. We are anti-government,
but not quite anarchist. Maybe you
could call us conservative anar-
chists.“

YAF has offices at 315 SU, phone
is 362-5358.

At the opposite end of the
political spectrum, Pitt's YSA
actively pursues a world-wide class
revolution on the scale of Leon
Trotsky's vision.

Mark Satinoff, president of the
Pitt chapter of YSA. said revol-
utionary thought is still the basis
for the organization, even though
YSA is now engaged in political
races for Pennsylvania's US Senate
seat and for state governorship.

“We’re out to change society
from top to bottom,” Satinoff said,
“to present a realistic alternative to
the two big parties in this country
so people can fight and alleviate
the oppression of working people,
women and blacks.

“We think this country needs a.
revolution. But that revolution will
need direction and leadership, it
will not comeiof itself."

The YSA actively supported the
custodial workers strike earlier this
year at Pitt, was involved in
Student Government (SG) elec-
tions, and holds periodic public

forums on topics such as Water-‘

gate, according to Satinoff.

“We’re involved in all the mass
movements of social change,” said
Satinoff, “We’re Trotskyist in
nature, and part of an international
group.”

“We offer a variety of programs,
Satinoff said, “for instance this
Tuesday night we're going to have
Harry Ring‘.a guest speaker at our
office on South Bouquet’ Street..
His V subject is Socialism and‘

   

 

Individual Freedom."

During the summer, the YSA can
be contacted at 304 South Bouquet
or call 682-5019.

Also representing the leftist
perspective on campus is the SDS,

' a student organization of 60's fame

dedicated to supporting worker’s
movements and dealing with issues
of racism, male chauvinism, and
war.

The SDS led the fight on campus
this year against use of textbooks
which they labelled “discrimina-
tory" and “racist in nature."

The SDS office is located at 509
SU and phone number is 624-5960.

SOCIAL

Other socio-political associations
in the University community
lobbying for defined minority
groups are the Gay Students at Pitt
(GSP) and the Undergraduate
Women's Union (lJ_YVU).'

GSP chairperson Debbie Boyle
said the goal of the organization is
freedom of sexual expression for all
people, not just homosexuals.

“It's also to support people at
Pitt who are gay," Boyle said, “so
even if they won't come out of the
closet they can talk to other gays,
it's also to pressure the adminis-
tration and the student body into
protecting gays at Pitt. _

“Most people, especially ‘ SG,
think we just do things for people
who already deﬁne themselves as
gay. This is wrong. For instance
we want to hold a Human Sexuality
Conference next year which would
be interesting for everyone,
straights as well as gays."

GSP is a political organization
with a militant outlook “which
scares some people,” according to
Boyle. .

“We've done ‘zaps, which is
when we go around and chant,
make some noise, a lot of us in the
Tuckshop, just to let people know
we exist."

“It's militant, it's kind of
pounding at the door. The whole
gay movement is working towards
making it possible for people to
make choices."

GSP is currently involved in
prodding University administrators
into scheduling a course dealing
with homosexuality.

GSP is in the process of changing

offices, but can be reached through
a city organization, Gay Alterna-
tives Pittsburgh, phone number
363-0594, or at 317 SU.

Structured as a lobbying body for
the female population at Pitt, the
UWU focuses on “trying to interest
more undergraduate women to take
part in the liberation issue”
according to former UWU co-chair-
person‘Pam Steffey. _

As a watchdog organization the
UWU has become involved in
investigating health care in Uni-
versity ‘ medical facilities, estab-
lishment of a rape-crisis center on
campus and sponsorship of the
Women’s Cultural Festival.

“The Undergraduate Women’s
Union is feminist in nature, that is
the direction of the people involved
in it," Steffey said.

Although the University em-
ployment policies have been
corrected, there is still aineed for
redirection of health care policies.

“It is getting better on campus,”
Steffen acknowledged, “there have

. »- been cases of proven discrimina-

tion in hiring, but it’s not as bad
now as it was. However, the health
care issue is still important, health
care for women is still very bad in
Pittsburgh.”

The UWU has offices in 317 SU;
telephone number 624-5944.

One of the great movements of
this century has been the surfacing
of black consciousness in American
society, resulting in political,
spiritual and economic reverbera-
tions still affecting major policy-
making decisions today.

During the 60’s at Pitt, the Black
Action Society [BAS] was formed
as a- “black student government”
to coordinate and consolidate
efforts to reform University and
community prejudices and policies
and to provide black students at
Pitt with an organization capable of

expressing their cultural and’

historical perspective.
BAS president Graylyn Swilley
viewed the purpose of the

organization as one of “continuous

vv

struggle.
“Our scope isn’t limited to
blacks, we are oriented toward
breaking the barriers that exist in
the community, BAS is one of the
vehicles to help students get out of
here." ' '
Gary Plumber, chairman of the

BAS Political Action Committee‘

said, “Our purpose is making sure
they can survive in an environment
which is predominantly white.”

According to Swilley the BAS has
been involved in community and
educational activities such as the
Black Solidarity Fair, support of the
Arsenal Child Care Center, Pitt's
Black Week and Day Care in
Homewood.

“Black students entering Pitt,"
said Swilley, “‘will encounter
problems, and we're here to
alleviate those problems, we like to
think of ourselves as the black voice
of the students.

“Our purpose is to meet the

The Children's Crusade

needs of the black student, their
academic, political and social
needs, as a distinct group,” Swilley
added.

Plumber emphasized Pitt’s BAS
is a member of BASICS, a
state-wide network of black student
union organizations designed to
disseminate information and ideas
concerned with the black struggle
on campus and in the community.

“It has opened the state up for
us,” . Plumber said. “We’re
expanding beyond Pittsburgh.”

The BAS office is open Thursday
for an open house, in 420 SU from
11 am to 1 pm; phone number is
624-5957 or 624-6363. _

Dealing with the problems of
veterans readjusting to civilian life",
especially campus life, Veterans at
Pitt (VP) is an organization
focusing on involving the veteran,
with his special circumstances, in
the total_university community,
academically and socially.

VP is a lobbying agent, to make
the University officials aware of the
impact their policies have on
veterans on-campus.

VP has offices at 511 SU; phone
is 624-5961.

CONSUMER ADVOCATE

Apart from strictly political
purposes Pitt’s chapter of the
Public Interest Research Group
(PIRG) is a consumer advocate
group, functioning as a clearing-
house for information on defective
products, and a testing agency to
determine the worth of speciﬁc
market items. . 4

“We're basically a research‘
group, investigating social prob-
lems. We are not funded by the
University as are other PIRG
groups around the country so we
are a little limited. However Pitt’s
PIRG is the only functional PIRG in
the Pittsburgh area,” said Lisa
Kunst, PIRG president.

“We’ve done candidate research
for the New Sun, and study to-
determine if corporations and small
businesses were biased against
hiring ex-cons.”

Pitt's PIRG is currently involved
in a research program for the Yale
Institute for Responsive Education
to determine means of involving
parents in the decision making
processes ofischool systems.

Programs designed to inform the’

consumer of poor quality services
such as a seminar on the dangers of
certain food additives are included
in PlRGis community activities.

PIRG has offices at 313 SU,
telephone number is 624-5942, with
office hours this Tuesday from 1
pm to 6 pm. ~

These are the major political
groups run on campus by students
which invite. your interest and
participation. Each ~organization
represents unique opportunities for
young people to learn the ropes of
government and internal -party
politics. ‘

All ideals aside, they are
worthwhile experiences for that
alone. ‘

Student Responsiveness

 Needed for Effective SG-

BY GENE GRABOWSKI It doesn't take much ambition or
Pitt Student Government (SG) is intelligence to knock Student
alot of wasted time and.words. It's Government--it has enough critics

here at Pitt will tell you. Sadder adage goes, however, is the first

care to change it. This apathetic elaborate debate of trivial points,
miasma that pervades our campus, redundant discussions, and waning
relieved only during a successful deV0ti0n among some members
toward their work. One Board
member has called its meetings “a
circus." What we need now is a
responsive-student body, aware of
the Board's special duties and
-problems, to affect the necessary
[changes and create a governing
body truly representing all stu-
dents faithfully and efﬁciently.
This is not to say Student
Government is currently doing a
poor job. As a matter offact, under
the present circumstances, the
Board as a whole is doing a ﬁne
job. It's the student body that's
doing a poor job--about 2000
students elect seven Board mem-
bers and leave it at that, expecting
the members to reach decisions on
nearly every issue affecting 12,000
students! With odds like that, it’s
.no wonder Student Government
has problems. Obviously, it needs
all the help it can get from us.

allows a limited number of actively
concerned people to control the
direction of the entire student
body. For these few, Student
Government works. For the
majority, however, SG is little more
than a harmless start for the future
politicians.

Student Government is not the
weak ineffectual organ of the
student body many people think it
is. The policies Student Govern-
ment supports affect us for] years.
It functions as the primary
governing body of allrecognized
student activity and represents
student opinion to the University
administration. Pitt's SG makes
decisions concerning dorm se-
curity, funding of student organ-
izations, service fees students‘ will
pay, on-campus entertainment,
and operations of the student
advising center, to name a few. It
also serves as the student body’s
watchdog, pointing out short-
comings in the administration’s
service to students and proposing
alternated plans to correct them. It
has members on the Chancellor’s
Student Affairs Advisory Com-
mittee, the Provost's Advisory
Committee, the University Senate
and the Senate Council.

When students claim oppression
by a new University policy or
program too many do nothing more
than curse their fate and deride
Student Government for its inep-
titude. Had these students aired
their views.before a ﬁnal decision
was rendered on the matter, their
needs may have been met in a more
satisfactory way. Students should
make a special point to be informed

Frosh Statistical Profile: , 
   .. Where Do You Fit In?

BY RITA VITOLO

Confronted with the daily pre-
sence of approximately 28,000
self-proclaimed Pitt students, in-
cluding at least 18,000 undergrads,
a freshman at the Oakland campus
can feel comforted knowing he has
a statistical leg to stand on.

The Class of 1978 has enrolled
2271 students at Oakland, a 15
member decrease from the size of
last year’s class at'this campus.

As of June 1, 371 freshmen were
enrolled in the School of Engi-
neering. and 106 in the School of

Nursing. The bulk of any first year '

class--in this case‘l794 students-~
opts for the College of Arts and
Sciences.

Bucking a nationwidetrend in
decreasedenrollment in institu-
tions of higher education, applica-
tions to the University were slightly

higher this year than in the past. V

According to Dean of Admissions

‘Kenneth J. Wenger, approximately

50% of the students who apply to
Pitt begin college here and
approximately 60% of Pitt students
receive some kind of financial aid.

A survey of last year’s freshmen
conducted by Pitt’s Office of
Institutional Research and Plan-
ning Studies found their primary
reason for attending Pitt was its
reputation as a good school.
Second, they , came because’ of
interest in a specific major.

The male-female ratio of admit-
ted students is nearing a 50-50
distribution, with figures from the
previous freshmen class ‘showing
1290 males and 996 females
admitted. Minority representation
at Oakland was slightly over 10%
of the 1973 freshmen, with 10.3%
blacks 0.1% American Indian and
0.2% Oriental.

Michelle and Barb

Seven per cent of that clas were

non-Pennsylvania citizens and 93%

claimed state residency. Of those,

56%—-1291 students--lived in Uni-.
versity housing during their first
year.

According to Dean Wenger, Pitt
students traditionally rank high
academically in their high school
classes. Half of the freshmen
engineering class in 1973 were in
the top 20% of their respective
graduating classes; 86% of the
freshmen nursing students and

g 65% of the CAS group were in the

same percentile. The average SAT
score for the three schools was just
short of 1100.

V Admissions to the University are
stabilizing, with the boom Amer-
ican colleges and universities
experienced during the mid 60's
effectively over, Wenger said.
Admissions to the School of
Engineering are up substantially
however, as thejob market in those
fields grows ever more tantalizing.

The Engineering”School's Direc-
tor of Recruiting, Dr. Wesley M.
Rohrer. estimated 1/6 of the
incoming freshmen class will be
female. Minority students account
for 8% of the group.

Less than 30 women have
graduated from Pitt’s Engineering
School in its 125 year history.
Presently, S6 undergraduate wo-
men are enrolled in the school and
12 women in graduate depart-
ments. Rohrer claims women
engineering students actually have
an easier time in the program than
the men: “Women are more
advantaged scholastically, usually,
when they get here and more

highly motivated, more determined

to last.”

‘Eighty per cent of the freshmen
class wil1_ﬁn-ish the four year course
by Rohrer’s estimate; 30% of
those go on to attend graduate
schools of engineering.

, Freshmen engineering students
face two major problems, Rohrer

, said: ' little contact with engineer-

ing courses at the outset and an
inability to ‘schedule time to
balance school and social life.

Advenjuj-GUS Search for Jobs jIr'rosh\Slolisficol- Profile: .1...
Where Do You Fit In?" 

BY TOM SMITH

On an urban campus such as Pitt
many job opportunities are avail-
able for students seeking part time
employment during the school
year. With effort, determination
and ingenuity a freshman willl have
little trouble ﬁnding a part time
job.

Pitt students-can take advantage
of three sources of employment
when job hunting. They are the
Student Employment Placement
Service, the streets of Oakland and
the Pitt News Classiﬁed Ads
section. .

The Ofﬁce of Student Employ-
ment is responsible for the
placement of undergraduate and
graduatestudents seeking part
time employment on and off
campus. “All kinds of jobs are
available both through the Univer-
sity and outside the University."
according to Supervisor of Student
Employment, Thomas W. Rush.

The Placement Center is located
in room 219 Student Union. The
bulletin board located outside the
center lists jobs available from
prospective employers outside the
University. ‘

The Employment Center will not
assist incoming freshmen during
the orientation session. “I can't
even take care of them now." Rush
said. "I cannot help them until
September, 1974, ‘and then they
mustlhave both the validation and
ID cards. That's University policy.
not mine."

- wait

Rush added freshmen should
about two weeks before
applying at the center in the fall.
“It takes about two weeks for any
jobs to come into our office in
September."

If the Employment Center does
not offer adequate adventure for
job seekers, freshmen can be
advised to take to the asphalt
jungle of Oakland. Enough
business establishments are lo-
cated in the area, so stumping the
streets should result in more than
sore feet.

Most of the stores and restaur-
ants located on the strip hire Pitt
students. both male and female.
The response of one quick service

restaurant manager was typical. ’

“We demand only one thing from
our employees, and that is simply
that they be able to work the hours
they are needed.”

Job hunting on the -streets of
Oakland is best done in the
daytime. But, nighttime job
hunting could result in jobs which

pay more than the minimal wages

offered by the stores and restaur-
ants on the strip.

Those freshmen unsatisfied with
both the Placement Center and the
streets of Oakland and who desire
even more ‘adventure while job
hunting can consult the Pitt News
Classified Ad section. The Pitt
News will satisfy freshmen looking
for the ultimate in job hunting
adventure. 1

Ads for

babysitters run fre-

quently. In addition, free room and
board is often exchanged for
babysitting and other light chores.

One such ad recently offered_a free
Florida vacation in exchange for
babysitting services for a three
year old girl.

In addition to legitimate jobs
such as cocktail waitresses and
shoe shine boys, the Classiﬁed ads
section provides _ a forum for
businesses which if advertise em-
ployment best described as unique.

Someday, when opening the Pitt
News to the classified ads do not be
surprised to find ads such as the
following which have appeared in
the paper over the last two years.

“Girls of exceptional physical
strength wanted for paid research
interviews." “Mariachis wanted--
two or three to serenade at surprise

“Are you...Male, 21-30 yrs?

smoker? Interested in earning

questions, and desire further

Before the Freshman Engineer-
ing Program was adopted two years
ago Rohrer claimed, the drop-out
rate among first year students was
near 40%. By Rohrer’s estimate,
the two-term offering of introduc-
tory engineering courses supple-
menting the required basic science
and math cut that to 10%.

One hundred and twenty women
make up the School of Nursing's
1974 first year students, including
transfers from degree programs
and Pitt's branch campuses. Six
hundred undergraduate nursing
students are enrolled in the school,
which was founded in 1939.

More students traditionally opt

into one of CAS's 32 majors and six
programs of pre-professional study
than any other school of the
University, although 22.7% of 1973
freshmen were ofﬁcially undecided
about their future. The ﬁve most
popular majors among entering
students were biology (5.3%),
psychology (4%), political science
(3.3%), mathematics (2.6%), and
chemistry (2.2%).

The six pre-professional areas,
which can not be used as majors at
Pitt, accounted for more than 28%
of the 1973 freshmen majors. The
number of students entering as
pre-meds--10.5 per cent of the 1973
freshmen--continues to rise, ac-

Remember Malcolm!

“. . . So in this country you find two different types of Afro-
Americans, the type who looks upon himself as a minority
and you as the majority, because his scope is limited to the
American scene; and then you have the type‘ who looks upon
himself as part of the majority and you as part. of a micro-
scopic" minority. And this one uses a different approachin-
trying to struggle, for his rights. He doesn’t thankyou for
what you give him, because you are only giving him what he
should have had a hundred years ago. He doesn’t think you

are doing him any favors . . . ”

sense of inﬁnity in those words.
:But 30 years from now, no matter
where you are or what you’re
doing, there will always remain an

Pitt. There is also a tangible bond
here however, which will inform
‘you and enlist your help in regards
to the future of the University of
Pittsburgh. This bond is the
Alumni Association.
. Pitt graduates around the world
compromise the group known as
the General Alumni Association

until you leave Pitt four years from
now. Once you’re a Pitt alumnus,
however, there are rewards and
beneﬁts we can all take advantage
of.

For example, not only do the
alumni sponsor career seminars
and help in setting up job-
training sessions, but they also
provide a job service which will
help Pitt graduates ﬁnd employ-
ment any time throughout their
lives.

“Anytime that Pitt graduates
need our help,” Fyock noted,

i“we’ll serve their requests, whe-

ther on the status of their
children's admission, or just
general complaints about the
school's policies.” '

To keep their members inform-
ed, the Association publishes Pitt
Magazine, The Alumni Times, and
periodic newsletters throughout
the year. Through these publica-
tions, information about the school
circulates and a constant up-to-
date report on what's happening at
the University is available.

Like most college alumni associa-
tions, Pitt is interested in raising
money to improve programs and
facilities. This year Pitt is
approaching the $1 million mark for
the first time.

A graduate from Pitt--Class .of
'07 summed up perfectly, the
benefits of being a Pitt alumﬁus.

improve their communicative
skills and their ability to relate to
the needs of their fellow humans.

At designated round tables in
efficient mini-labs. the mentors
debated questions that predeces-
sors in their role had asked. How
can we most effectively help the
freshmen?

As their training progressed
and their growth expanded. the
Mentor were now readying them-
selves for the opportunity to de-
vote all of their time to studying
the human condition and its per-
plexities. It was then that they
gathered into one group and went
on pilgrimage—to Titusville.

It was here that the Mentor was
readied for the real task he had
been preparing for—helping the
freshmen as much as he could.

 

Their stay was disciplined and
demanding. They were expected
to build towers and castles out of
practically nothing. And they
were asked to absorb the essence
of their surroundings. Some were
so overcome that they claimed
they had finally found their Titus-
ville.

But. of course. duty called and
the Mentors returned to the land
of Pitt to wait in silent medita-
tion for the arrival of the fresh-
men.

Lady DeJean and her indispen-
sable staff also spent hours in
carefully planned preparation for
the big moment.

Then suddenly. in_the early
hours of a Sunday morning it_
happened. The first of them ar-
rived. In small numbers. then by‘

Job Hunting
Takes Ingenuity

(Continued from Page 7)

“Part Time Help (5 gals and 5
guys)--Massage work. Experience
preferred but if need be will train.”

Incoming freshmen must first
decide, though, whether it is in
their best interests to take a part
time job before testing the job
market. For many freshmen the
change from a high school
environment to the college" scene
can be a traumatic experience.
“Most incoming students do not
work their first year in school
because of i that readjustment of

habits from high school,” accord- .

ing to Rush.

Rush does not encourage fresh-
men to take part time jobs. “I
think they ought to think twice
about taking a job in the first year
of college because they must take
on added responsibilities from high
school." He admits in the past his
warnings have fallen on deaf ears,
and this fall will probably be no
exception.

 
  
  

 

‘ drinks

BY JESS BRALLIER

What do boredom, depression,
graduation, Tuesday, sexual frus-
tration, rain, snow and sleet have
in common? Good enough reason
for a beer, that's what.

I was once told\that bars serve
for all those drinking
reasons. so following is a list of
your best bets in the Oakland area.
' Wooden Keg: Everybody tends
to ﬁnd the Wooden Keg. before
theirjfour‘ years at Pitt are drunk
away. and in fact, there may be
some validity to the rumor that an
evening at the Wooden Keg is
mandatory before one's diploma is
issued. Of course. there's beer on
tap, but the Keg's best offering is
its short stumbling distance from
the dorms--and at 2am that
becomes surprisingly important.

The Original Hot Dog Shop: It's
a terrible atmosphere for sit-down
drinking but the take‘-out selection
is huge. One of very. very few bars
selling take-outs on Sunday. Also,
a complete quick-food menu to help
you out if your drinking starts
before dinner.

Bimbo's: ' Bimbo's offers an
impressive decor which may we_ry\
well become blurred through, the
glories of Schlitz on tap. Ray
DeFay leads a rag-time-sing-along
every Friday and Saturday starting
at 9:45 pm. Bimbo's pizza isalso a
tasty enough way to soak up those

pitchers. The $.75 cover charge is

well worth it is you're fed up with
scratchy juke-boxes, talk, and bad
groups. .

Luv Inn: If for so-me strange
reason you've got $2.00 for a cover

-charge and if for solne under-

standable reason you want to hear
some good live entertainment, this

is the place. Two of Pittsburgh's
better groups. Gravel on Fridays
alld Magpie on Saturdays are here
year around. The music's great,
but it you insist on being drunk,
you could afford somewhere else
before the music starts at 9:30 pm.
The Decade: One of Oakland's
newest bars, it's located on Atwood
Street. Under the new manage-
ment of Hank Zunder, the
Decade's going to be offering quite
a bit. If you get a mean thirst, the
Decade's ﬁve drafts for a dollar
ought to help every Monday,
Tuesday and Thursday. Fridays at
10:00 pm there's live 50's music
and Saturday, again. at 10:00 pm
Dearﬁy supplies the live 70's
,music. Wednesdays and Thurs-
days at 9:00 pm ﬁlms ranging from
sports to Marx Brothers to Steve
McQueen will be shown-—what
better way to enjoy a drink? Or
two? The Decade also offers a 2 for
1 evening and Thursday is ladies'
evening. Nothing's perfect in the
ﬁeld of economics so if you're a

little low on cash, you just might '

want to skip Friday night's cover
charge. -,
- Sonny Daye’s: Sonny steadily
offers Eric Kloss, a jazz saxo-
phonist, 13th in Playboy's jazz and
pop poll, one of the country's very
best. The atmosphere is pleasant,
there's no cover charge the prices
are decent, and there's no excuse
for missing out on the music.
Wolfarth’s Pub: Wo_lfarth's is
basically a drinking bar. They offer
Schlitz and Iron City on tap and the
price is right--$1.00 a pitcher
before  pm alld $1.25 til_l .that
terrible hour of 2 aln. Live
entertainmellt is offered on and off
durillg the year and for a drinking

bar, there's a surprisingly nice
sexual and racial crowd mixture.
' Pink Panther: Another drinking
bar. but/if you're not here on an
athletic scholarship, you might feel
a bit out of place.

Sam and. Bernie's: Another of
the few too many with Iron City on
tap. A good college drinking
crowd, the prices are cheap, and
you can't beat the Iron.

The Holiday Bar: The Holiday's
on the far end of Forbes toward

' Carllegie-Mellon and is one of the

best known in the. area. I've
personally never made it, to the
Holiday but I can suggest that you
might want to ask around before
dropping in--you'll either enjoy the
atmosphere or ﬁnd yourself dis-
interested.

The Portfolio: The Portfolio's on
South Craig just off Forbes. For
the male chauvinist in all of us
chauvinists, Sue, the bar maid,
may prove of interest. The
Portfoliofeatures live folk music.
. The Luna: Part of wino's heaven
where Center and Craig intersect.‘
Within a block you'll ﬁnd the Luna
(the Wooden Keg of upper
Oakland),~Chief's_(a great drinking

‘bar with a great bartender--you

a nicer one),
and a- beer

may never meet
Rudy's Tavern,
distributor. /

Hadden Hall: One of 'Oakland's
best. Free popcorn every night,

ladies night on Wednesday, and

Tuesday is $.15-a-hotdog night.

'Th"e atmosphere is pleasantly clean

and the men's roomgrafﬁtti is a
highlight in itself. The price is
right, too—-$1.00 a pitcher before 8
pm and $1.25 from there on. The
bar chairs here are .the most
comfortable in Oak1and——just right

a Tuesday, June 13, 197'<'1—THE PITT Nnwsxpag

AnOakland Bladder is a Happy Bladder

for a long anti-depression bout.

There's plenty of older neigh-
borhood bars ill the area such as
South Craig St. Inn and ‘Coyne's
which you can try, but the
atolnsphere of such places all too
ofter_ put a damper on your
drinking. There's a state store on
Forbes and one on Center for those
of you who enjoy the taste of
hard-stuff at home.

That’s about it except for a few
warnings to the unknowing. This is
Pennsylvania and you don’t drink
unless you’re short on hair,
equipped with false cards or 21.
Trying to get served when under 21
is difficult and if you’re legal but
don’t look it, you’d better\take all
your cards along.

From downtown, transfer busses
fan out to every part of Pittsburgh.

It may seem surprising to find
that the true center of Pittsburgh is
a park. Point State Park is located
where the Allegheny and the
Monongahela Rivers join to form
the Ohio. The 36-acre park is one
of the results of the City’s attempt
to reclaim its heritage from the
encroachment of commercial
slums. T

It was at the Point in 1758 that
General John Forbes and the
British Army defeated the French,
resulting in English dominion over
the colonies. The Fort Pitt Block
House, built in 1764 by Colonel
Henry Bouquet, still stands at the
Point as the oldest authentic
structure in Western Pennsylvania.

It is open to the public Tuesday
through Saturday from 9 to 5 pm
and Sundays from 2 to 5 pm. There
is no charge. Two of the original
ﬁve bastions of the fort have been
restored and house a museum
devoted to the frontier period of
local history. ‘

The Civic Arena shares with
Point State Park the distinction of
being part of the city's rejuvenation:
attempt. Dedicated in mid 1961,
the $20 million Arena boasts the
world’s largest steel retractable
dome. Covering 20 acres of the
Lower Hill, including parking, the
building can seat 14,000. It is
Pittsburgh's center for concerts,

exhibits. political, business and
civic meetings, and various sports
events such as Triangles tennis,
wrestling and ice hockey. The box
office, located in the building,
doesn't accept. checks for tickets.

Heinz Hall, located at 600 Penn
Avenue is the plush home of both
the Pittsburgh Symphony and the
Civic Light Opera and a showcase
for big-name performers like Lena
Horne, Liberace, and Marcel]
Marceau.

With the redevelopment of the
Golden Triangle area, which
replaced warehouse slums with
high rise office buildings of steel,
glass, and aluminum, came a
number of Pittsburgh's most
impressive buildings. In the
cluster known as Gateway Center,
consisting of the Westinghouse,
State Office, and Bell Telephone
Buildings among others, resides
another Pittsburgh first: KDKA--
the world's oldest broadcasting
company.

The triang_ular,US Steel Build-
ing, Pittsburgh's tallest, is unique
in several ways. The exterior
construction is of COR-TEN, a new
steel which slowly coats itself to
avoid corrosion, turning from its-
present russet brown to a blue-
black ﬁnish. The building features
one of Pittsburgh's best, and most
expensive restaurants The Top of
the Triangle, on the 62nd floor.
There. is also a heliport on the roof
to accomodate vertical take-off

I each way.

planes. -

Not only the structures in
Pittsburgh are noteworthy. The
City has developed unique ways to
see itself. The oldest of these is the
Duquesne Incline, a cable railway
climbing the side of Mount
Washington. The view from the
overlook at the top of Mount
Washington is beautiful, especially
at night. The incline is open every
day until 1 am and the fare is $.25
One of the few
remaining in the US, the Incline
was repaired and restored in 1963,
although the cable drum and
wooden-toothed drive gear are the
same ones in use in 1877.

- Taking a cruise on the Gateway
Clipper ﬂeet presents another view
of the City. The Fleet consists of
the Clipper. the Gateway Party
Liner, and the Good Ship Lollipop.
Sailings are from a dock on the
Monongahela River, at the foot of
Wood Street.
daily cruises are $2.25 for adults
and $1.50 for children under 12'.
Reservations are required, and

times vary, so it is necessary to call ~

the ticket office. Special cruises at
night, with dinner, are also
available.

A more mundane way of seeing
Pittsburgh lies in the busses and
trolleys. However, even these are
beginning to present a unique facet
of Pittsburgh. - Port Authority
Transit (PAT) has begun painting
these vehicles in rainbow ‘shades

Fares for the twice ‘

withappropriate wording such as
Spirit of '76, Fun Bus, Ecology, and
Pittsburgh: Some Place Special.
The North Side of Pittsburgh is
an area of special interest, and was
also subject to intense redevelop-
ment efforts. The North Side is
reached by taking- a" 16 D Woods
bus from downtown, or by walking
across the 6th street Bridge and
skirting the Allegheny Center Mall.
The Old Post Office, located on
Allegheny Commons, now a
museum of Pittsburgh’ past, was
built in 1894-7 as the Post Office of

-Allegheny City. It was markedfor

demolition in.the late 1960's but
persistent organized citizen protest
finally’ saved the building. The
Museum is open 10 am to 4:30 pm
Tuesday through Friday, 1 pm to
4:40 pm Saturday and Sunday.
Admission is $1.00 for adults, $.40
for children under 16.

Next door to the Old Post Office
lies Buhl Planetarium. The
Planetarium, built in 1939 as an
attempt to halt the blightof the
North Side, features a sky show
titled the Last Question until
October. The 45 minute show
begins at 2:15 daily and costs $1.25
for adults and $.55 for children
under 16. Special exhibits in the
building cost $.85 for adults and
$.45 for children. One of the most
famous annual exhibitions, the

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

Jacques-Yves Costeau, the am-
azing Kreskin, a pornography
symposium, The Way We Were
and The Fantasticks will highlight
entertainment programs being
planned for the coming school year.

Those organizatons playing a
dominant role in planning enter-
tainment on campus are the

' Student Union Board (SUB), the

Franklin Pangborn Film Society
and the Student Government
Programming Committee (SGPC).
Assistant Director of Student
Activities, Jack Brown, said, “The
SUB ischarged with the responsib-
ility of creating programs of an
extra-curricular and educational
nature for the undergraduate
students. '

- “The Board seeks to increase the
awareness and appreciation of a
variety of cultural art forms, issue
oriented programs, lectures and
social events. We do a lot of
different, unique and fun things.”

According to Brown, the SUB
will sponsor such diverse programs
as a lecture with films by_

oceanographer Jacques—Yves Cos-I

teau, a pet show where students
can show their pets and win prizes
andra symposium on ‘pornography

from an educational point of view. A

A dance marathon, and a New York
Theatre production of the Off-
Broadway play,Th'e Fantasticks,
are also being organized for the
upcoming school year as well‘ as a
fall greenery show where students
can I learn" to grow plants.

The SUB will also sponsor a
Friday night ﬁlm series in David
Lawrence Hall beginning on
September 13 with Jesus Christ
Superstar. Other films include
Sleuth with Sir Lawrence Olivier,
Sounder and Tales From The
Crypt with Peter Cushing.

The Pangborn Film Society will
also offer a Thursday and Saturday
evening film series to be held in
David Lawrence Hall.

The Saturday lineup of outstand-
ing movies will include the
Academy Award winning picture A

Touch of Class, The Way We

Were, Stanley Kubrick’s A Clock-
work Orange, Woody Allen’s
Bananas, The Day of the Jackal,
High Plains Drifter with Clint
Eastwood and an all night horror
festival.

The Thursday series will consist
mostly of notable foreign films.
Bert0lucci’s The Conformist, Truf-
faut’s The Wild Child, Fellini
Satyricon, Costa-Gavras’s The
Confession, and Bogdanovich's

»Targets with , Boris Karloff will

highlight this series.
The Student Government Pro-
graming Commitee (SGPC) has

plans to bring the psychic Kreskin, ‘

a major political leader, a best-
selling authorand a rock group to
Pitt during the year. Plans for the
SGPC programs for the school year
are still not definite according to
acting chairman, Chip Sipcic.

“We will be offering six major
concerts for the year plus three
coffeehouses," Sipcic noted.

Last year, the SGPC.sponsored
such people a. Senator Hubert
Humphrey, Paul Simon, Kris
Kristofferson, BB." King and
George. Carlin. I

Freshmen interested in working
with student programming can do

The Conservatory-Aviary, lo-
cated across Allegheny Commons
from the Planetarium, is unique in
that it affords an opportunity to see

a variety of rare and tropical birds

in a natural setting, and in free
flight. The birds are not caged.
Visitors simply walk through rooms
planted with tropical trees, among
which the birds are free to fly. The
Aviary is open 9 am to 4:30 pm
every day. Admission is $.50 for
adults and $.25 for children under
18.

Three Rivers Stadium, home of
the Pittsburgh Pirates and the
Steelers, lies on the north side of
the Allegheny River. The Stadium
seats approximately 50,000 and
covers about 10 acres. In addition
to sports events, it sometimes hosts

exhibitions, concerts and other

special events.
Pittsburgh has a reputation as
the f‘biggest small town in ‘the

' world.” That could be the best of

both worlds. For all its size and

is that great American delicacy. the
hamburger. served in a tepid
greasy condition at the various\fast
food spots. lt it happens to be your
kind of place. McDonald's Town-
house is ' probably the least
objectionable. with hours lasting
long enough for an active popula-
tion. The Eat 'n' Park Big Boy
restaurant across the street rates at
least a close second. and the menu

"includes more than just the “big

boy" hamburger structure.
Papa Joe's at the corner of
Forbes and South Craig features

the ground beef monotonies at a

special volume rate. plus other
quick service sandwiches. For
those with no regard for taste,
there’s Winky's on Forbes, who

will make you "happy to be
"elsewhere. And for the truly
adventurous. Oakland has three

White Towers, on Forbes and
Bouquet, on Atwood. and further
away on Baum, where the all-night
hours. coffee and ‘eternal breakfast
are now bigger attractions than
their original hamburgers. And
alka-seltzer is quickly available at
all local drugstores.

There is culinary life beyond the
plastic little burgers. As all you
finger-lickers know, there’s fried
chicken. Kentucky Fried Chicken
has two local outlets, but you’d
better be willing to walk, to the
Boulevard of the Allies [by the
Playhousel or up to Baum
Boulevard. Winky’s also carries

Page l2—THE PITT NEWS—Tuesday, June 18,1974

if The Cheaper, the Quicker, the Less You'll Eat

fried chicken for the more daring,
and Roy Rogers, at Forbes and
Oakland, offers “Western-style”
chicken. The “howdy, pardner”
place features roast beef sand-
wiches, a bit/ juicier than those
offered by Arby’s several blocks
down Forbes.

Pizzas and hoagies have_become
a staple for many, and Oakland has
a number of places that offer one or
both. Bobby’s _of Oakland on
Atwood has a full menu of Italian
dinners, pizza and sandwiches.
Beto’s on Forbes, sells a variety of
pizzas, as does Gino and Pete’s"on
South Craig. Bimbo’s, on Bouquet,
is a bit more expensive for its fare,
The Wooden Keg Sandwich Shop
on Forbes offers a number of
different subs and hoagies, as well
as pizzas. T here’s other sand-
wiches- available at the S&B
Sandwich Store on Craft, near the
Playhouse, and the Dawg Patch on
Oakland, featuring hot dogs, of
course.

But man doesn’t live by the/same

’old thing, there’s a little bit of the

unusual around that won’t kill your
wallet. Three Middle Eastern
restaurants offer totally different
menus that will tantalize your
palate and be kind to your pocket.
Ba’albek, on Atwood, and Ali
Baba’s on South Craig, are both
within walking distance and stu-
dent‘s price, ranges, while Omar
Khayyan, further away on Baum
Boulevard, may be a bit elegant for
a casual meal.

Also for people seeking some-

Schenley

thing different is the Taco Hut on
Forbes Avenue. which features
Mexican food at prices competitive
with McDonald's. And of course
there's the expected Chinese
cuisine. at the Bamboo Garden on
Forbes, which can offer a refresh-
ing change of pace from hamburg-
ers. '

When you,get tired of .counters
and have saved the bread for the
table and waitress scene, there's

several restaurants around‘ to take _

care of you. Canter's, on Atwood.
has a high level deli menu and
reasonable bar that caters mainly

to a non-student crowd. Cicero's, '

on Forbes Avenue, features an
Italian menu and booze, also for an
older crowd. .Pace‘s. on Fifth
Avenue. is more the counter
service routine. but has a varied
menu and convenient location to
the dorms. Th_e Pancake K_itchen,
on Forbes. specializes in (guess
what) pancakes served in many
different ways. as well as. other
items. Sweet Williams. on Forbes.
has the-preservative taste of the
fast food places. and it's safer to
stick to the take-out ice cream
cones. In any case, remember to
tip. or risk dirty looks (at the least).
Your waitress may be a fellow
student. Save Nino's and the Park
trips for when your
parents decide to treat you to
dinner.. .

There's more to life than the few
blocks defining the Pitt campus.

one at Forbes and Wood and one on

There’s also an Arby’s neat to

BY ADRIAN MCCOY

If you are going.to be living in
Oakland for the ﬁrst time this year,
you are probably already hearing
nasty rumors about how there is
Nothing-To-Do-On-Weekends, es-
pecially if you enjoy good ﬁlms and
live stage shows. If you already
live here, you probably believe it.
It's not quite true, though. Here is
a modest list of theaters in the

Oakland area that pres_ent both live _

performances and good ﬁlms.
Theatres
University of Pittsburgh Theatre--
Stephen Foster Memorial

Presents one Show per term. -
Productions are well-known plays
that have been given innovative
interpretations. Provides working
experience for acting and technical
theatre majors. This year's
productions will be Cabaret,
Pantaglieze, and Look Back in
Anger. Season subscﬁptions are
available. _'
Studio Theatre--Basement, Cathe-
dral of Learning

It is to the University Theatre
what Off-Broadway‘ is to Broadway.
While mainstage shows have some_
popular appeal or commercial
value, the Studio gives performers
and directors a chance to experi-
ment with works of a more
avante-garde nature. Theatre Arts
majors direct productions. Small
theatre achieves intimate atmos-

.phere, intense emotional exper-

 

4 ing.

 

 

 

  

ience. Presents both well-known
plays and esoterica (some works
are written by students) that
otherwise would never be produced
in that nasty dog-eat-dog world Out
There. Nice shows. Real cheap.
Only one dollar, that's it.

Other college theatres:

. Carlow College--3333 5th Ave.
Worksin pretty much the same

, vein as Pitt's University theatre. ‘

Carnegie-Mellon--Fine Arts Build-

Productions always worth see-
ing. Hard to get in if you’re not
part .of the schoo'l~. You have to wait
until all the students and alumni
are seated. If there are empty
seats, you get in. The breath-tak-
ing technical effects are well worth
the wait.
Pittsburgh Poor Players UACM--
corner of 5th and Bellefield
Presents about three shows a
year. Does a lot of social

‘quality that
famous someday. You used to have
., to go to New York to‘see these

consciousness raising plays (Kop-
it’s Indians, Berrigan's Trial of the
Catonsville Nine). Company works
under the most primitive —of
conditions. and does very good
work in spite of it. . Bad
acoustics--don't expect to hear
every line. Good place to go when
you’re tired of the foggy avante
garde stiiff and want to see a play
that means something.
The Playhouse--222 Craft Ave.
Once upon a time, the Playhouse
was the place to go for live theatre
in Pittsburghflt wasljust about the
only place you could go. Now it

seems dead and sits on the corner,

of the Boulevard and Craft‘ Ave.
looking like a great white whale
stuck on a sandbar--very impres-
sive, very noticeable and totally
useless. Several small ship-
wrecked acting ‘companies occa-
sionallyiﬁnd refuge there. Point
Park College stages its very ﬁne
productions there. The indepen-
dent companies bring out the real
commercial stuff like Hello Dolly
and No No Nanette, which leads’
some to believe the Playhouse still
lives, if that can be called living.
The Laboratory Theatre--3300 5th
Ave. »

--Does some of the most innova-
tive performance work in the city.
Presents three orifour shows a
year. Productions are .the
culmination of a 12-week workshop
in which members apply some
concept of theatre aesthetics
(Brecht's alienation techniques,
Artaud’s theories) to a perfor-
mance situation. ‘Essentially an

actor's theatre. Good place for real‘

theatre junkies in search of bigger,

better kicks from a live ‘perfor-

Pittsburgh. North Side is all bars,

hot dog shops, porno places--and
the North Bank. An_ exotic
neighborhood_that tries to be all
things to all people.

Movie Theaters

King's Court--3807 Forbes Ave.
The most convenient movie

house for Pitt students. Hard to

miss. It's the fake Arthurian castle

next to the White Tower restaur-

ant. Runs high quality ﬁlms that

usually do well when the Oscars are ‘

being handed out. p

The Strand--3615 Forbes‘_Ave.
Has a single or double bill of

second run, second class ﬁlms at

‘ reasonable prices. Mostly R and X

ratings. Features the sludge you
see at drive-ins, but it’s always
good for a laugh». A,drive-in for
people without cars. ,

The Strand _leads a double life by
being the Pittsburgh screening
place for the American Film
Theatre, which is a series of art-y
ﬁlms. These are usually successful
stage plays that have been adapted
to thejscreen, featuring the creme
de la creme of the theatre
profession. Chekhov wrote, Pinter
directs. Kate Hepburn acts. Many

critics feel these works are
over-rated. Subscriptions are
available.

The Forum and Manor Theaters--

TONY DORSETT spins away from two tacklers in route to a record
breaking afternoon against the Fighting Irish. Dorsett gained over

1500 yards last season earning him All-American honors as a

freshman.

' BY DAVE FOUST

Prior to my arrival at the
University of Pittsburgh in January
of last year. my curiosity concern-
ing the negative statements people
passed my way about Pitt athletics
provided me with the expectation
of exactly that. Events occurred.
however. which disproved dog-

 matic statements.

Three months after my arrival I
was convinced Pitt_was indeed a
“tired" placeand a great many
individuals were making it that way
by behaving as though going
through the motions of existence on
a big-time university campus was
enough in life. Like football teams
of the past Pitt basketball was on
its way to a losing season. _

Then one day in early spring,
something happened which caused
my most solidified opinions to be
threatened. Before my very eyes
was a herd of people in sweat-suits

'\staggering around the track in Pitt
Stadium, actually perspiring! Was
it the “Major Change,” for real!?

Since that day there have been
drastic changes. People sharing
the same environment normally
enjoy seeing their efforts equal to
the efforts and achievements of
their peers.

Buzz Ridl. Tim Grugrich. and
Fran Webster certainly didn't let
Coach Majors and his fine staff
have all the attention. The hoopers
answered the gridders Fiesta Bowl
invitation by winning the Steel
Bowl (Pittsburgh) and the Razor-
back Classic (Arkansas).

One small tragedy befalling the
Panthers early in the season was an
82-78 surprise defeat in their
season opener with West Virginia

 

at Morgantown. Then came the big
train of victories.

At Philadelphia it was Pitt 36
Rutgers 21. a game shortened
considerably by a demonstration.
Pittsburgh's Civic Arena and The
Steel Bowl found Pitt 82- Duquesne
65. Things did not go well for Red
Manning and Lionel Billingsby;
Pitt sports fans began to believe.
The next night: Pitt 82~Florida
State 60 and Pitt's first silver cup
since 1963.

Then at the University's Fitz-

gerald Fieldhouse. Pitt 90-Cornell _

55. A few more began to believe as
Howard University. a small black
school trying to make it big in
basketball. suffered the Cornell
treatment: Pitt 98-Howard 73.

_ It was Fiesta Bowl time. The
hoopsters answered by devouring
Army 86-56. Christmas vacation,
everyone goes home. Like well, the
hoop squad is off the scenic

‘Arkansas for its three day vacation

and commences to pour on the East
Coast basketball for sports fans in
Little Rock.

The Razorback Tournament

Dorsett also set a new one—game

265 yards against Northwestern, 79

Of course, Dorsett couldn’t have
led Pitt back to national promi-
nence by himself. He was joined
by the Panthers’ head coach and
resident miracle worker, Johnny
“Pride and Enthusiasm,” Majors.

Majors. who helped work the
Panther miracle in 1973, was hired
in December. 1972 after working
perhaps a greater miracle
leading the blighted Iowa State
football program to its first two
bowl invitationsin history.

The US Football Writers and the
Walter Camp Foundation agreed
on Majors as II973 Coach of the
Year. following Pitt's reversal of
their miserable 1-10 year in 1972.

“We have to continue to grow,
and not be self-satisfied or rest on
our laurels,” Majors said. “It’s
not going” to be easy, ‘buf we

Look for another ‘major change’

in Pitt athletics this year. But, this"

time, not in football.

Pitt Athletic Director Cas Mys-
linski has revealed plans for a
totally revamped and greatly
expanded women’s athletic pro-
gram, that he says “will be among
the best in the country." The new
program will include scholarships
for women athletes for the first
time ever at Pitt, expansion of the

intercollegiate teams, the hiring of
an all new coaching staff of eight
women, a new women’s assistant
athletic director, an‘ increased
budget, and steppediup schedules.
“Now the women will have a true
intercollegiate program instead of
just an intramural one,” Myslinski
noted in outlining his plans.
“We’ve intended to build up our
women’s program, and with the
social climate today’, now is the
time to move forward with a

progressive program.”

Starting with the basic structure,
it will be an all new approach. The
program has been placed in the
Athletic Department under the
overall direction of Myslinski.

In turn, Myslinski has named
Sandra  Bullman to head" the new
program as Assistant Athletic
Director for Women’s Intercolleg-
iate Athletics. "Miss Bullman has
coached the Pitt women’s basket-
ball team the past five years and

compiled a 42-7 record. A graduate
of West Virginia, she also has
taught and coached at Slippery
Rock State College and Parkers-
burg (WV) High School. .
Miss Bullman, who will have her
office in the Field House, has set
some high goals for her program.
“I have no doubts that we will
have one of the best programs in
the country for women’s athletics,”
she says. “We’ve got good
facilities, great cooperation and an

But. of course. the greatest
graduation lbss is that of world-
class long jumper Bill Rea, who
was lC4A champion, both indoors
and outdoors. in all four years of
his eligibility -at Pitt. His
achievements would till a modest
sixed book.

 

Despite this loss the Panther
program looks strong in the future.
Rick Markley, who won the
1000-yard run at the Ohio State
Invitational, returns as a senior to
head a bountiful group of middle-
distance runners including juniors
Martin and Jack Patrick, and
sophomores Betterley and Wayne
Cooley.

Hurdler Jay Sharpley leads a
potent group of sophomore hurd-
lers, and George Jupin and

weakness will be in the field
events.

That is, if his team'doesn’t spend
another season in sick bay.

Pitt Wrestling Dismal?  

earned his spot in the meet as the Pl

Pitt wrestling fans suffered
through a dismal year last season
as the Panthers compiled a dual
meet record of only 5-12. The
young. inexperienced Pitt squad
were up against probably the
toughest schedule in‘ the East,
facing such college powers as
Navy, Penn State, Clarion, Michi-
gan .and Oklahoma, last year's
NCAA champions. E The team
showed great courage and deter-
mination but they came up short in
nearly every match.

The Panthers./ opened their
season against .Michigan and
almost immediately their record
was 0-1 as the eventual Big Ten
champs completely dominated the
meet. However, the Panthers
came right back to take a big win
over Temple just two days later.

The Panthers next traveled to
New York for the Long Island

“Invitational where they dropped

two matches to Michigan State and
Oregon State. Then they moved on
to the Naval Academy - for three
more matches inltwo days. Navy
had little problem torpedoing the
Panthers and Oklahoma also
defeated them in a laugher, but the
Pitt wrestlers salvaged "a bit of -the

A weekend by defeating Princeton.

On the way home the Panthers
stopped off in College Park,
Maryland and _their record was
soon 2-6.

Throughout the first few weeks
of the season it was obvious the
Panthers were no match for the
tough schedule Coach Dave Adams
had arranged for them. They were
defeated by wide margins in nearly
every match with only freshman
Rande Stottlemyer showing any
true wrestling ability.

When the Panthers. traveled to
Lehigh College for another quad
meet, George, Bryant ,was with
them. Bryant was inactive during
the first term but he made his
presence known at Lehigh with
three big wins at 118 pounds.
Bryant teamed with Stottlemyer,
Pitt's 126 wrestler, to give the
Panthers a one-two punch which

was as good as any team's in the

nation. ‘

Bryant and Stottlemyer couldn't
do it all alone as ‘the Panthers
continued to lose. After dropping
matches to Lehigh, Indiana State
and Oregon State for_the second
time, they traveled to West
Virginia where they won big. Next
was the match against powerful
Clarion which lowered their record
to 3-10. With two more wins in
their last four matches, it was
obvious the Panthers were one of
the weak teams of the East.

Bryant and Stottlemyer didn’t‘let
the poor showing of the team hold
them back. They were both headed
for the NCAA tournament. Bryant

“Minor Sports”: Depending On Football.

BY BART MACK
SPORTS EDITOR

I can remember the time when,
being just a sophomore or
freshman in high school and my
older brother just entering college,
I was asked by friends. “hey man,
where's your brother going to
school?" And with all respect for
the academic reputation of the
iiistitutioii aside. I answered.
“Penn State."

"Yea . they've got a p'retty good
football team."

“You'd better believe it."

And so when it was my time for
that “big step” into the higher
levels of education I was approach-I
ed by a youth barely of high school
age with that same question--
“hey man, where you going to
college?” « *

"Pitt."

“You've got to be kidding...their
football team stinks. their basket-

‘ball team stinks..."

I really didn’t care much--I didn’t

 have plans to _play any sports



      

anyway. But when I caught my
first look at what Pitt was calling
“college football,” I knew exactly’
what that kid meant.

With Carl DePasqua then coach-
ing. an autumn Saturday afternoon
at Pitt Stadium was more like a
circus than a football game. After
two_ years of utter disgrace in

_athletic circles, Cas Myslinski
figured it was time for a wholesale
change.

The move was underway to bring
the days of old back to Pitt
athletics——and more money into the
athletic department so a general
renovation of the entire sports

program coLIld take place.

Enter Johnny Majors.

Enter Tony Dorsett.

Give them both anything their
hearts. desire and bang--Pitt is\
changed into the winning team. A‘

cinclerella story. rags to riches,_

from I-10 to 6-4-1 and a trip to
Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl. Next
year‘? Well. the rumor is a major
bowl bid would be in order at Pitt
can handle its relatively rough
schedule. ’

And there are always those who.

voice their arguments of the over-
emphasis of athletics and the sheer
neglect of academics. They cried
when "Majors was given an
‘unlimited account to recruit new
fortunes. They cried about ‘the
possible jrecruiting academic atro-
cities that just might be taking

place. They asked, “What about
the other students? What about-
intramurals?”

Well if you don't know it by now,
there just isn't any other way to
build up the athletic department
and intramural program of any
university unless the varsity sports
can make money. Losing football
teams don't make money and
football is the money making sport
of every college in America. You
just don’t get something for
nothing and it took a sizeable
investment to turn Pitt around.
The results so far have been
nothing short of remarkable and
the future looks even brighter.

The other varsity sports can only
prosper from the “Major Change."

Right now.
reputable program going and
should have one of the best in the
country in five years.

The following are just short
accounts of what Pitt has going in
sports besides football and basket-
ball. sports that deserve recogni-
tion. sports that will get “that
recognition with the success of the
money makers of the athletic
department.

soccER

Leo Bemis. who is the head ‘of
intramuralsi besides coaching
soccer. is an institution at Pitt. He
has coached soccer for more than

Pitt has a fairly.

20 years and has quite a record to
show for it. Lately, however. he
has geared his program to the local
soccer player and has a reputable
team every year. Pitt graduated its
first professional soccer player just
this spring in Joe Luxbacher, who
signed with the Philadelphia Atoms
of a newly formed North American
Soccer League. Bemis always
produces one of the finest
defensive teams in the east and
plays such powers as Akron,
Cleveland State, Penn State and
West Chester.

BASEBALL

College baseball is currently

gaining the importance it deserves '

as a bonafide “minor league" and
coach Bob Lewis has had Pitt
contending for the NCAA tourna-
ment every year. Last season was
not up to par for Lewis but the
spring weather in Pittsburgh hasn't
been conducive for baseball for
quite a while. The last Pitt grad to
make it in the world of pro baseball
was Ken Maccha. who a_t last
report was paying his dues

. catching in the Pirate's chain of

farm teams. The most successful
Pitt grad of late is the New York
Yankees' starting pitcher George
Medich, who by the way is also an
alumnus of Hopewell High School.
as is Tony Dorsett. Medich was
both a football and baseball star for

SWIMMING

Next year will be the year for
coach Diclf Bradshaw. who sent

several youthful representatives to I

both the ECAC
competition last winter.
by diving coach Al Coffey, Pitt's
swim team enjoyed a successful
season last year but had sporadic
performances in the pressure
meets. Divers like Hector Bass,
who represented Puerto Rico in the
Pan Am games last year, give Pitt
added strength in that department.

Two years ago the AAU Diving
Championships were held at Trees
Hall Pool with some of the best in
the country attending.

GYMNASTICS

and NCAA

Coach lg Perez didn't win a

Assisted ’

match last year but it was a recent
milestone of achievement for the
Panther gymnasts. Two years ago
gymnastics was considered nothing
more than a joke by even the most
ardent Pitt followers but Perez has
instituted a change in the program
that equals none. That they lost all
their matches can't be denied, but
each score was a respectable one.
The future is bright for that sport
also.
