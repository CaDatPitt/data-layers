Delays

Appointment

By ANN WALKER

Pitt‘s Faculty Assembly decided
to postpone the appointment of a
new associate provost for the univer-
sity‘s libraries, preferring instead to
hold further discussions on the
position.

The ' decision to postpone the
appointment came after a report by
the Special Senate Comittee on Uni-
versity Library Reorganization at
Monday‘s special Faculty Assembly
meeting.

The proposed centralized library
system would include the appoint-
ment of an associate provost and
director of libraries. The directors
responsibilities would include
budget reviews, automation deci-
sions and uniformity of personnel
and cataloging, said Allen Janis,
chairman of the -committee. The
new position and its office would
cost approximately $l00,000 a year,
Janis said.

“Its hard to see why a new admin-
istrator is needed, said Mark King
of the School
Professions.

“Aren’t those people in the library
now able to handle the automation
without the need for a new adminis-
trator?” King asked. He added that

books are needed more than
administrators.
Philip Koch, a professor of

French and Italian,‘ said the asso-
ciate provost “would have the right
of review but wouldn’t be able to act
on that review or be able_to do any-
thing about it.”

SAAC Plans For New Term

By LARRY LEDERER

In the past the agenda of_the Stu-
dent Affairs Advisory Committee
(SAAC) has included such things as
student dorm vandalism, allocation
of football tickets, and deciding uni-
versity bus routes, according to
Chancellor Wesley-Posvar.

The SAAC, made up of represen-

,tative student leaders, was formed

by Posvar to give representative stu-
dents a chance to speak up and inte-,
ract with administration.

At yesterday's SAAC meeting, the
first ofthe year, Director of Student
Activities Andy Smith said the
group is valuable because students
can freely voice their university con-
cerns to high level administration
and get -feedback. According to
Smith, the purpose of yesterday’s
meeting was primarily for everyone
to get to know one another.

Chancellor Posvar said SAAC is
important because “you as students
can speak for your constituency; you
know what they are, and you know
what they want.

“Our meetings produce no deci-
sions because we want an informal

' exchange process. We try to meet

once a month to discuss problems
arising from studentzlife."

Posvar pointed out topics for
future meetings might include any-
thing from student athletic facilities
to grading systems.

' “The book center, the honors pro-
gram, teaching fellows, and the ren-
ovation of the student union will be
topics of future discussion," Posvar
said. “For instance, the renovation

Joe Resnick, a University of
Pittsburgh senior, has developed
a revolutionary device that will
restore speech to those who have
had their larynx removed
because of cancer.

Resnick has created an tone

emmitting device that would be
housed in a patient’s dental
work. According to Resnick this
device makes use ofall remaining
speech apparatus i.e. tongue,
teeth, hollow ofthe mouth, etc...,
by simply replacing the “reed-
type tones that have been lost
through surgical removal ofthe
larynx.
“Tone quality will be reproduced
to match the patient‘s forme.
natural tones. for instance mid-
dle C, Resnick explained. Inflec-
iions and voice level will vary
with articulation of the tongue.
Lowering the jaw will activate
the device.”

Resnick, a College of General
Studies undergraduate and engi-
neer for Penn Center. began
researching the idea when a close
friend. Murray Marcus. with
whom‘he works, became a victim
of Laryngocaroenoma (cancer of
the throat) and lost his ability to
speak.

What ‘happens to a woman after
she is raped—-how she adjusts, to
whom she turns-—is the subject of a
recent study by a Pitt social work
professor.

lt’s also a subject ofincreasing sig-
nificance, especially in the light ofa

- recent bill introduced in the Penn-

sylvania legislature that would pro-
hibit a husband from using marriage
as a defense against rape‘of his wife.

‘Dr. Barbara ‘K. Shore, chief
researcher of a Pitt studyon the long
term social consequences of rape,
commented favorably on the
spousal rape bill ‘now awaiting
action in the House. A

“I approve of giving women the
right to bring charges of rape against
their husbands” Shore-said. “l think
theibill has some chance of passage.”

Shore and a teamof researchers‘

spe_nt two years studying 127 women
from the Pittsburgh area who had
, been raped. She said that the women
xwere from the’Pittsburgh~Center For
Victims of Viole/n/t Crimes, Pitts-
burgh Action Against Rape, and a
large number of college-age women
who had been raped while in college.
The latter group of women had

volunteers for-‘the study.

Shore said the researchers looked
-at various factors in the lives of rape
victims, such as the nature of their
backgrounds, and how much emo-
tional support they had.

‘fNot surprisingly, women who
had strong support could adjust bet-
ter after t a rape than those who
didn’t,” Shore said. 0

Effects of Rape

Shore said a sample of the find-
ings were: '

0 Women are most likely to turn
to other women for support after
being raped;

' '0. A woman’s husband is not
initially supportive of her after a
rape occours.

“Marital relationships are often
disrupted after a wife is raped,”
Shore said.

According to Shore, bills such as
the spdusal rape bill are the likely
result ofthe growing women’s move-
ments and an increasing awareness
of women.

If the legi-slature passes the bill,

‘Pennsylvania will become one of

only six states to expand the crime of

If the ideaof living in a shelter of
concrete two feet thick in order to
escape nuclear fallout frieghtens
you, you are not alone and there is
an organization at'Pitt madejust for
you.

The Arms Race Study Group,
which meets Tuesday’s at noon in
the English Department, discusses
some of the aspects of the threat of
nuclear war, according to Assistant
English Professor Liane Norman, a
member of the group.

» The sessions are a follow up to
convocation held in November
between Pitt and Carnegie Mellon
University, to educate people on the
perils of nuclear war, according to
Norman.

She said that although the
convocation was well attended,
there were “publicity problems”
with such a large scale event and that
the group’s present operations grew
out of the need for “more modest
and achievable” objectives.

, The group was formed in
December l980 when “a group of
professors, graduate students and
undergraduates” got together and
decided that the arms race was a real

ydanger, of concern to English

 eachers because we deal in
something that has longevity~——~
language*~--——and we intend it to

go on into the future,” Norman said.

“We thought that there was some
reason to be concerned aboutlthe
danger of nuclear ~ war, which
seemed to us" to be growing and we
organized the group,” she said. The
group discussed- literature on the
arms race.

As the organization grew,
Norman said, “it saw the need to
become "more organizationally
active and so it got involved’, with the
convocation.”

One of the primary concerns of

the group is what happens when the l

issue of the threat of nuclear war is-

brought into the
according to Norman.

classroom,

She said it can.be an “upsetting
and frieghtening.thing’~’ when it’s
discussed in the classroom.

The biggest problem of teaching
about the threat of nuclear war in a
classroom setting, Norman said, is
that of emotions. '

“Everybody is terrified that we.

may blow up the world and that fear
is usually repressed," she said’. “The
fear comes out when we talk about it

and l think teachers are afraid they _

may lose controlioftheir emotions.”

Another fear many teachers have
concerning the threat of nuclear war
is that of it being so controversial
Norman said.

“I think a lot ofteachers are afraid
they’ll get flack from administrators,
and even
students,” she_said. ’

A third problem, according to

i Norman, is that teachers don’t quite

know how to introduce it. “lt’s a new

thing and there are questions oﬁhow.

to do it," she said.

The immediate goals ofthe group
are to have people “think through

‘aspects of the issue".

Ona longer term basis, she said
she would like to have the group do

something to “educate the university
community” on the special session T
of the United Nations on
disarmament in June.

Scott Rex, a Pitt student and a_
member of the group, said the .
discussion sessions were “an
educational process for everyone.”
“We kick a lot of ideas around, and
debateiamong ourselves,” Rex said.

Membership in the group stands
at about l2—l_5'regular members,
according to Norman, but she added
that it fluctuates and she expects it to '
grow “when people become more
aware of what we’re doing.” ‘

She said the group is “functioning
well. We’re organizing and doing
what we were organized to do.”

Calling the training of El Sal-
vadoran troops in the United
States“insane,” a group of about
40 demonstrators gathered
downtown outside the Federal
Building Monday to voice oppo-
sition to the arrival of the troops

\ and to Reagan’s decision to con-
tinue draft registration.

“lt is insane for the American
taxpayers to spend millions of
dollars to train these assassins,
only to have them return to their
country to slaughter innocent
citizens,” said Al Petrarca, a
'member ofthe Central American
Mobilization Committee, one of
the groups who organized the
protest.

The New York‘ Times reported
that L500 El Salvadoran troops

‘ were expected to arrive in the

US. on Jan. ll to begin l0 weeks
of special forces and guerilla
warfare’ training at Fort Bragg,

A North Carolina.

Upon completion of training,
the soldiers would return to El
Salvador, the paper reported.

Petrarca cited a report by
Amnesty International and the

. El Salvadoran Human Rights

Committee on human rights in
El Salvador.

The report lists massive ci-
vilian casualities attributed to

l

 Draft Policies

killed in the first nine months of
l98l. The military, security for-
ces, and right—wing.death squads,
which operate with the coopera-

_ tion of the government forces,

were responsible for 90 percent
of these deaths according to the
report.

Petrarca also said that the
French and Mexican govern-
ments have recently recognized
the guerilla opposition as the sole
representative ofthe El Salvado-
ran people, and called upon the
present military junta to open
negotiations with them.

“The junta’s call for elections
in March is worthless consider-

ing the forced absence of the
opposition parties from the bal-

lot and the political repression

and violence directed against the
people,” Petrarca said.

“The American government’s
military and economic aid and
their training of these Salvado-
ran troops will only prolong the

suffering of the El Salvadoran
people,“ he added.

ln addition to criticizing Rea-
gan’s position on El Salvador,
the protestors expressed their
opposition to the continuation of
draft registration in the U.S. and
prosecution of those who failed
to register.

“The ACLU (American Civil
Liberties Union) opposes peace-
time draft registration and the
prosecution of those who fail to
sign up, according to Tom Kerr,
president of the Pennsylvania
ACLU.

“It is crazy for the Reagan

 administration to threaten those
who fail to register with prosecu- ‘

tion five years imprisonment and
a $10,000 fine, considering over
one million draft-age youths
have failed to do so.”

The current police of the"

Gina Miller, a graduate of La
Roche College, was recently named
as the new assistant director of the

,Pi_tt Program Council.

After serving as the Director of
Student Activities at La Roche for
three years, Ms. Miller worked for
Duquesne University, where she.
coordinated fraternity and sorority
activities and later served as the
assistant to the Dean of Students.
Two months ago however, she
moved up in the world when she
accepted her present position at Pitt.

“The organization was healthy
when I arrived, so ill basically be
trying to keep things rolling. I'm also ‘
interested in helping develop the
leadership of the different commit-
tees,” she said.

Ms. Miller’s areas of concentra-
tion are the planning, budgeting and
promotion of PPC events. She spe-
cifically deals with the concerts, art
performances and lectures.

“This term we have Chic, The
Outlaws, the Moral Majority
Debate, The Amazing Kreskin, and
several other events to go along with

' the movies,” she says. She added,
“It's already a full schedule, but we
may even be able to plug in a few
surprises if we get lucky.”

“I started doing this as an act
of compassion,” Resnick said.
“My friend was really suffering
and so was his family. The ability
to speak is tied in very closely to
one’s identity, and it's loss can be
a crushing blow.”

"My mend could no longer
interact with people, causing
great pressure and pain to both
and his family.”

“I believe that the root of all
science and medicine is helping
people, compassion. As I
thought about creating a device
to give speech, I set about to
make something small enough
and inconspicuous enough to
reduce the social stigma of the
present devices.”

Present communication for
Laryngocaroenoma is by esto-
mer, a hole in the throat that is
used to make belching sounds by
diaphramal speech. Only one-
.fourth .of these patients are ever
able to attain this skill.

Two hand-held devices, also
used by these patients have
proved to be cumbersome and
unacceptable. V

Resnick’s device would be
installed in a cancer patient‘s
mouth immediately after sugery
and would end the tramatic
peroid of readjustment that the
patient and his family go through
before learning new ways to
communicate.

Laryngocaroenoma strikes
nearly eighty-nine thousand
Americans annually. Resnick
has already received many letters
from victims who are seeking to
have the device installed.

“The device will be out on the
market very soon but the first
Resnick Emmitter will go to my
friend Murray Marcus,” Resnick
said. “He’sjust one hell ofa nice
guy and I’d sure like to see him
helped by this."

Resnick is in the process ‘of
receiving Food and Drug
Administration approval, which
must be done before the device
can be placed in human patients.

' It took Resnick three years of
researching electronics, medi-
cine, anatomy, physiology, and
neuro-anatomy to create his
ernmi_tting device.

Stronger
Voices

Ther_e’s an old axiom: lfyou can’t do it, teach it. And
if you can’t teach it, teach gym.

While there certainly is no validity to this statement,

it probably grew out of a sentiment that prevailed a
few decades a-go~—teaching is an easy way to earn
money while working a few hours a day for only nine
months a year. But growth in science and technology,
along with new meanings and interpretations in art_
and literature, have created the need for highly sophis-
ticated, better-educated and more well-rounded
teachers and professors in our school and university
systems. .

This becomes relevant in light of the recent desire of

i Pitt professors to take a more serious, active role in the
decision-making processof administering the univer-
sity. Last week, Pitt faculty members indicated this
need at a University Senate Council meeting. As engi-

’ neering professor Wesley Rohrer, president of the
Senate, pointed out, the university has not yet even
begun to approach the idea of truly collegial
management. f

Two recent events signal loud and clear that the
faculty not only has the capability to participate in the _

‘process, but has the need for a strong voice as well.
First, the. Faculty of Arts and Sciencesdeveloped,
streamlined and finally approvedthe new curriculum '
reform package that will have alnajor effect on the
future of academics at Pitt. Certainly no single level of
the Pitt hierarchy. could have accomplished such a ~
formidable task without the knowledge and expertise
of the faculty. .

Secondly, and mostimportantly, the recent merger
of the faculty unions is a strong indication that the
faculty not only wants, but needs, a voice in university
management. As Pitt Professional Union President
Philip Wionssojuccintly points out, the only guaran-
teed way to get this voice is through collective bargain-

’ ing. By involving the faculty in the decision-making
process, the administration would not only placate ~
any problems that would arise in the faculty-
administration relationship, but would prevent our
internal problems from being solved by an outside,
th_ird-party arbitrator. -

’' There’s only one hitch, however. Such a plan can
only work if the faculty members make “decisio_n- .
making” their third priority. They’re hereto teach
first, followed by their research and publication
responsibilities. Too much activism in the decision-
making process and not enough time spent in teaching
and research would defeat the very purpose the faculty
seeks~a smoother, well—run university. '

The communication process" is essential inevery

. organization, whether it be a giant corporation, ’a
small club or a university. Effective communication
depends upon how wellall functions of the organiza-
tion interact with each other. lt’s time for the univer-
sity administration to recognize “this and give our
faculty Amembersja stronger voice in the decision-
making process. '

Cheerleaders Overdoi‘ Whip It?’ 7

Dear Editor:

As Pitt sports fans, weattended
the soiriewhat disappointing Pitt-
Rutgers game "last Saturday. As we
began our cold walk down the hill

\after the game, the loss was not what’

stood out in our minds. Instead we
were disappointed and offended by a
specific routine performed by the
Pitt cheerleaders.

Late in the second half, during a
break in the action, the cheerleaders
took the court as the, pep band»
played.the popular song “Whip It”
by Devo. The ch :erleaders began to
bop up and down in a manner famil-
iar to any Pitt student who has hit
thedance floor inthe last six months.

After the first few bars, the ten or
so cheerleaders paired off into
male/female couples and the males

proceeded to pretend to slap their
female partners across the face back
and forth. The act was repeated sev-
eral times as these young college
women jarred their heads from side
to side in a jerking motion to, the
beat of the music. We were appalled.

The “’cheer'leading routines are
supposed to be performed for enter-
tainment, but the underlying mes-
sage of this routine “is not

entertaining. A slap, which may

have seemed harmless in this rou-
tine, is often in actuality a very
serious and painful form of physical

M0vePitt

Regarding the Student Govern-

ment Board’s weekend junket ’82: l I
can certainly sympathize with the

problems of having meetings'on
campus. I go to classes and meetings
here in Oakland and I’m sorry to
report that it is difficult. As Joyce
Giangarlo said. “On campus there
are too many distractions." A
Right. Joyce. Often I find myself
distracted by fire sirens. noisy stu-
dents. radios an other things. \
1 Linda O’Connor had a good
point, too~the SGBers had to get to
know one another. l've.been living
near Oakland for years and We
never gotten to know an_i'bod_i' here.
O‘Connor also stressed the impor-
tance of sharing a room- with a
stranger for the night to get to know
“these little habits before we start
making policies." Certainly nothing
like that happens in Oakland."
Perhaps Spencer Davis was wisest
ofall: “We worked together for eight
hours and then had the opportunity
to party together}; Golly, Spencer.

sexual assault. Sexual assault and

violence against women is a serious
and frightening matter. One outof
everyifive women has been physi-
cally or sexually abused by the time
she reaches eighteen years of age.

This-issue cannot be ignored and
should not be condoned, especially
on college campuses. The average
sexual assault victim is twenty--one
years of age—'making us realizethat
such abuse is taking place on college
campuses across the nation.

A while ago we witnessed an
assault on a Pitt coed" by her boy-
friend at the end of a party in one of
the dormitories. To the many bat-
tered women who suffer in our
society, incidents such as the one we
witnessed at the party or even a
“supposedly”_ harmless dance rou-

tine at the basketball game are evi-
dence_that the problem is hidden,
ignored and even made light of.
This letter is not meant to be a
general criticism of the Pitt cheer-
leading squad. Granted,vthey work
very hard to cheer on our teams and
represent our school. However, as a
group representing the university to
home and away audiences, they have
a responsibility to keep their’perfor-
mances in good taste and realize the
implications of their actions. 7

— 

OK. You’re a skiing aficionado.
You’ve skied the slopes at Vail,-
climbed above the tree line at Mam-
moth Mountain in California,‘
cruised the moguls in Vermont, and
cut the powder in Utah. Regional
skiing is, well, simply not up to par.

Fine. You go to those mountains

‘ and leave the regional ski areas for
the rest ofus. An extra spot in the lift
line would certainly be welcome at
Seven Springs, Hidden Valley,
Snowshoe, or any other local ski

0 area.

Because the truthiof the matter is
that Pennsylvania and the regional
area offer some of the nation’s best
skiing, and it doesn’t cost alot to get
there.

With 40-plus ski areas in the state,
Pennsylvania actually has more pla-

ces td cure terminal ski-fever than

, California, Vermont, Utah, or Colo-

rado, which has 36 ski areas. News ‘

a York, with 80, has‘_more‘ than any
other state in the nation. a
But it’s notjust the quantity ofski

areas in the region that is impressive, '

it’s also the quality of each individ-
ual area—'making for some fine ski-
ing south of the Vermont-New
0 Hampshire border.
"As a rule, regional ski areas dor_i‘t

usually have more than 25 slopes or 0

trails.‘ and I2 chair lifts.‘Conditions
can vary greatly, from the infamous
boiler plate or ice, to untracked
powder, particularly along the edge
ofthe slopes.
Lift lines, however, can be a prob-
._lem at many of the regional resorts.

; ' On a good winter‘ weekend, Seven

Springs can get ‘up to 8,000 skiers,
Camelback in the Poconos up to
l0,000, and Ski Liberty near Gettys-
burg up to 6,000. So itis good stra-
tegy to plan your skiing during the
weekday whenever possible to avoid
the crowds.

College students can usually find ‘
-S a good dealon /lift passes to their

liking, such as Snowshoe in West
Virginia, which offers -students $4
offthe regular price ofa lift ticket on
weekdays, and Blue Knob has half-
price days on Tuesdays and Thurs-
days. If you havea lot of friends who
enjoy skiing, you can probably
arrange for group lift ticket and

4 lodging rates.

Here are some tips to keep in mind
when skiing in the region:

0 Know your trail markings, and
avoid the slopes or trails which
might be beyond your ability. Rem-
ember: a green circle points out the
area‘s easiest trails; the blue square
marks the more difficult terrain; and
the black diamond denotes the most
difficult terrain.

0Learn ‘to recognize .ice, rocks,
trees, and other natural hazards.

0Make sure your bindings are
loose enough to release in a fall, but
tight enough so that they don’t
release at random.

0Bring your own food or some-
thing to snack on, as the food is
often times expensive at ski areas.

ODress properly: this means not
wearing jeans just because they
make you look sexy—-jeans can also
absorb water, and nobody looks

sexy with a cold. Any ski shop has a, ~

wide selection of nylonvbibs or— ski
pants, and you can usually find a
pair to yourliking.

0Wear goggles or some other

/

form of eye protection during snow '

storms or on windy days, preferably
with yellow lenses, which highlight
the terrain on‘ overcast days.

What follows is a selection of
some of the region’s best ski areas,-
including descriptionsofthe terrain,
prices, locations and telephone
numbers for additional information.
Some terms used ‘are: mogul—a
large mound of snow caused by ski-
ers turning; vertical drop—th'e dif-
ference between the elevation ofthe
mountain and the base ofthe slopes;
headwall—-«any single, continuous,
steep ‘area of a slope, usually at the
beginning, which tends to have a lot
of moguls; bump—-a mogul.

BLUE KNOB-With the steepest
vertical drop, I052 feet, and the
longest run in Pennsylvania,-two
miles, Blue Knob is the place to go if
you‘re serious about skiing but don't

have the time to go to Snowshoe in

West Virginia or the money to go to
Vermont, anyway.

There are enough steep headwalls,
treacherous mogul fields and show-
off runs at this mountain near John-
stown to keep even the most diehard

enthusiasts‘ happy. But with ski
areas like Blue Knob, there‘s no need
to go to Vermont, anyway." Q

Of I46 slopes on the 3,l50-foot
mountain, I2 arerated more or most
difficult, .while only two‘ are rated
easy. Probably one of the most
trickytruns in the state, Blue Knob's
2,l00—foot Extrovert is so steep that
the lower headwall as seen from the
beginning of the run actually disap-
pears under’ its own steepness.
Extrovert - cuts diagonally under
both of Blue Knob’s double chair-
lifts, giving the lucky skier a captive
audience, and the unlucky skier a
lesson in humility.

Hotdogs will enjoy 2,250—foot

High Hopes and 2,400-foot Route

66, more to most difficult runs that
shoot down under the length of both
chairlifts. Pennsylvania's longest
run is ‘Mambo Alley, which is more
than two miles of beginner to inter-
mediate skiing with a few small
bump fields. Other good runs for the
bump addict include 4,000-foot
Stembogan and 1,400-foot Edgeset,
which has a short but ' difficult
headwall. i

Because all skiers were not created V‘

equal, Blue Knob also offers novice
and younger skiers their own area,

which has two platter pull or Poma ’

lifts-. A 90-minute group lesson is $6.
and a one-hour private lesson is $l5.
e Of interest to college students are
the half-price days for students on
Tuesdays and ‘Thursdays. Other-
wise, adult lift tickets are“ $l2 on
weekdays and $18 onweekends and
holidays. Ladies" lift tickets are also
half-off on Wednesdays. Night ski-
ing from 6 to l0 p.m. seven nightsa
week. is $9. Lift lines can get pretty
hairy, since there are only two lifts
servicing the entire mountain, so
make it a point to get your best runs
in early beforeethe crowds arrive.
Blue Knob is not called Blue
Knob for nothing; It can get pretty
cold on top of this windblown peak
in Claysburg, so it is advisable to
bring lots of warm clothing. Make
sure you have antifreeze in your car.

HIDDEN VALLEY—lf your defi-
nition ofa bump is the thing you get
when you hit your head as you walk
through the door, this neighbor to
Seven Springs is just the place for
you. The slopes here are notﬂtoo dif-
ficult; and it’s an excellent place to
learn tolski.

There are some difficult runs with
steep headwalls, such as Cobra,
Thunderbird and Ski School, but
most of the slopes are generally well-
manicurediand manageable, and the
vertical gets no steeper than 500 feet.

The best feature of Hidden Valley,
however, isthe price. Adult weekday ’
lift passes are only $l0, while night
passes for skiingifrom 4:30 to l0:30
p.m. are only $8 for adults. Weekend
l_ift tickets are $l4 for days and $8 for \
nights. Group lessons are $7 and a
private lesson is $17. Day rentals are
$l0 foradults and $7 for juniors.
Hidden Valley also has lodging in its
hotel for $45 a night, and offers con-
dominium, townhouse and chalet
rentals at reasonable rates.

To get to Hidden Valley. take the

' turnpike east and get offat exit 9. the

same exit for Seven Springs. _But
instead ofturning off Rt. 3|, take 3l
all the way to Hidden,Valley. For
additional information or ski
reports, call (8l4) 443-l4l4.

SEVEN SPRlNGS——Probably the
most popular~and largest-ski
area for Pittsburghers not wanting
to travel a long distance for good
skiing, Seven Springs has opened
this season with some major renova-
tions to its snowmaking and already
extensive lift systems. .

A new $450,000 triple chairlift

, was installed on the moderately dif-

ficult Tyrol slope, and six Fan-Jet
portable snow cannonswere pur-

chased by Seven Springs. With the; 
addition of a fifth compressor';""

Seven Springs can now pump more
than 8,000 gallons of water per min-
ute or about ll.5 million gallons a
day into 300 of its 450 snowmaking
towers.

But skiers do not live by artificial
snow alone; there has to be some
place to put all that snow.,And if l8
trails and slopes spread across 5,000
acres of former farmland isn‘t put-
ting all that snow to good use then
the thousands of skiers who visit
Seven Springs each week certainly
are. ,

Unfortunately, those thousands
of fellow skiers can be one of the
drawbacks of Seven Springs, partic-
ularly on weekends and ‘Friday
nights, when local high school and
college skiclubs like to schedule
their trips to the slopes. Although
the large crowds Seven Springs
tends to get during these times don’t
pose any particular safety hazards
on the slopes, it‘s getting to the top
of the slopes that can be the prob-
lem. Lift linesican be long. especially
on weekends. so try to arrive early-
around 9 a.m. when the lifts open-
to get in some good runs and avoid
the crowd. Weekdays ‘and nights,
like in most ski areas, are the best
times for uninterrupted skiing.

Another way to escape the crowd’
A

is to take one of three lifts--Tahoe.“
Blitzen or Sunrise to Sunset-to the
North Face of the mountain for
some medium to difficult skiing on‘
great and Little North Face slopes.

skiers can find some nice bumps and
even some powder before the snow
gets packed down. Be forewarned.
however; first headwall on North
Face can get pretty icy, especially
when_there is a heavy wind.

Other medium to difficult skiing

can be found on the Avalanche. 

Tyrol and Stowe slopes, while
beginners and less advanced skiers
will enjoy the Fawn Lane trail and
the Bunny slope. Morning and after-
noon lessons are offered daily at $7
per person for a class lesson, and $15
per person for" a private lesson.
There are also a number ofski pack-
ages available for groups and
individuals.

Seven Springs has four triple and.
five double chairlifts, two rope tows
and a Poma lift. Adult lift tickets are
$17 on weekends and holidays and
$14 on weekdays, and $12 for night
skiing.‘Rental. including skis, boots

and poles, costs $12 on days and $10 '

at night.

It takes aboutan hourand 15 min-
utes to get to Seven Springs from
Pittsburgh. Take the turnpikeeast
and get off at exit 9, and follow the
signs from there. Roads leading to
the mountain are generally pretty
good, but be careful during heavy
snow storms or in bad weather
before the roads can be cleared. Call
(814) 352-7777 for ski conditionsor
additional information.‘

SNOWSHOE, w. Va.—~lfyou want V

anything better than Snowshoe,
you'd probably have to go to Vt --
mont, or maybe even Colorac
Simply put, Snowshoe offers
best skiing on the East Coast outs 3
of Vermont and Maine, if you re
willing to make the four hour drive

from Pittsburgh to this West Virgi-

nia ski area.

In the first place, Snowshoe’s ver-
tical drop of 1,500 feet is as steep as if
not steeper than many ski areas in
the « Vermont. Green Mountains.
Secondly, ‘Snowshoe’s mountain is
one of the highest peaks in the
region, with an elevation of 4,848
feet, and certainly one of the highest
ski mountains in the East. And
thirdly, but certainly not lastly,
Snowshoes 7,500-foot Cup Run is
by far one of the most challenging
runs on any skiimountain, with more
than enough headwalls and bump
fields for the skiing aficionado. The
triple chair servicing Cup Run is one
of the longest of its type in the
nation. And Cup Run should posea
challenge~—it was designed by
Olympic superstar skier Jean-
Claude Killy. I ‘

And there’s still more. For some

reason,“the management of Snow-
shoe outdid themselves this year by

‘clearing four new slopes and build-
. . ing a new triple’chair_lift. One ofthe

new slopes, an expert run called for
obvious reasons Widowmaker, beg-
ins at the summit of the mountain

and is a straight, steep drop to the -

basin. The three other new runs are
“J” Hook, Hootenanny and Flume.

All the slopes areiserviced by the.

new, 2,550-foot triple lift, which is
also called Widowmaker.
The new lifts and slopes were con-

usually good places to get in those

the likes of Cup Run‘ or
Widowmaker. ' ~

Speaking of warming up, Snow-
shoe offers some fine lodging and
overnight mountain-top accommo-
dations for skiers planning to spend

‘more than one day at the area. The

best place for college students with
small bank accounts is Spruqe -
Lodge, since the rates are the lowest
of all the lodges on the mountain.
four-person bunk
rooms for $33 per person on week-
day nights,,and the rooms have pri-
vate baths.’ Rates are slightly higher‘
in Timberline Lodge, although the

1 rooms tend to be more spacious and

have telephones and televisions with
cable service. There are also con-
dominium packages for large
groups. ’

_ Althoughthe first hour of skiing is
free, from 8:30to 9:30 a.m.,don‘t get
caught without a lift pass after that. \
The lift operators are very strict
about passes, and it's not an uncom-
mon sight to see skiers stranded at

’ the base ofthe mountain or walking

up it (whew!) because they forgot or
lost their pass. Lift ticket prices are
higher than average: $21 for an adult
one-day pass. Passes are $17 Mon-s

day through Friday if you have a

student ID. Those prices decrease
relative to the amount‘ of days you
plan to ski. Group lessons are $10 a
person and private lessons are $22.

Snowshoe is -about 215 miles from
Pittsburgh, a little over four hours
driving time. Just take 1-79 south '
from Pittsburgh and get off at the -
Weston, W. Va., exit. From there,
go east on US 33 to. Elkins, then
south 48 miles on US 219. '

Pitt, Duquesne Fight for Life In,E-8

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Roy Chipman has no illusion
about his Pitt Panther basketball
team. Even when his team was 8-2
and beating good teams on the road
Chipman warned people that his
team was a long way away.

Of course, nobody believed the
good doctor. '

Panther Coach Roy _

Chipman, whose team -is
reeling slightly atter two
consecutive losses, was

ggqispleased with Pitt's
P effort in the George

Washington loss.

games so far this season.

By MARIE HUFF

it would appear that the New
Year‘s resolution for the Lady
Panther basketball team is: Show
’ the enemy no mercy. in their second
game of the new year, Pitt plowed
down the Youngstown State Lady
Penguins 83-54.
The win raised the Lady Panthers’
record to 10-4 as they head into the
great of their schedule, which

 eludes seven nationally-ranked

teams. _
Freshman Jennifer» Bruce started
the Lady Panther assault with a

three-point play to open the game.’
it Debbie Lewis also converted a

three-point play in the opening min-
utes, Bruce added two more buckets
and a bucket apiece came from Pam
Miklasevich and Carol Dugan_—-
which added up to an early l4-l lead
for the Lady Panthers. Thanks to
the resurging defense of the Lady
Panthers. Youngstown State did not
score their first field goal until the
i322! mark of the first half.
“We’re getting much better on our
‘man-to—man defense,“ said second-

‘i,,wr%’ear Pitt Coach Judy Saurer. “The

girls are getting much more aggres-
sive, and at the same time they‘re
staying out of foul trouble’?

The Lady Panthers did suffer a
minor offensive drought in theclos-
ing minutes of the first half. scoring
only seven points in the final seven
minutes. Youngstown State took
advantage ofthe lapse, scoring eight
unanswered points to pull within
eight, 25-17. The two teams
exchanged baskets in the remaining
five minutes, with Pitt takinga 32-25
halftiine lead to the locker room.

_ Although Youngstown State
“cored the first bucket ofthe second
~ .. If, the opening minutes were

..:arly dominated by the Lady
Panthers. Lewis turned into a scor-
ing machine for the first five min-
utes, putting in three layups and hit-

imuiumgil an ;ur_::tH{ wi'c:rI7'«'i:

 
  
  

   

The euphoria created by last
second upset wins over Tennessee
and Temple made Chipman look
like nothing but a smart con artist.
He’s just playing with our minds,
right? He knew he had a winner, but
just didn’t want to tell anyone, right?

Wrong! The evidence: Mondaey’s
75-70 loss to the George Washington
Colonials.

Whether Pitt will ultimately be a
winner or not is still up in the air, but
there is no doubt that Roy Chipman
has proved to be clairvoyant. Before
you could say Top 20 as some zeal-
you could say Top 20 (as some zeal-
ous fans had begun to dream), the
Panthers dropped two successive
games—league games-to Rutgers (no
real suprises here), and George
Washington. And you had GW

- chalked up as a win, huh?

No disrespect intended the Colon-
ials vastly improved, thanks to
frshman center Mike Brown; Never-
theless, it was a game that Chipman
figured to be one of his easier East-
ern 8 contests.

The Panthers two league losses
make tomorrow's Pitt-Duquesne
game at the Field House that much
more crucial. Granted it is Pitt-
Duquesne, and when the two get
together, a little jostling and a lot of
gut wrenching basketball are ussu-
ally included. Okay, okay ,it’s
always The Game for the two intrac-

, ity rivals, but it’s also a league game
_that neither team can afford to lose.

Duquesne Coach Mike Rice is in
pretty much the same bind as Chip-
man. Expected to be one of the
league hotshots, Rice’s Dukes have
gotten offto mediocre 5-6 start and a
horrible l-4 league record. A loss at
Pitt would make Duquesne 1-5 and
likely candidates to be on the road
for playoff basketball in March.

The Dukes took a step toward
averting that fate when they pulled
off a 10 point win against Rhode.
Island on Monday. Rice admittedly,

was ready “to throw in the towel,’»’,_

had his team lost.
Why haven’t the high expecta-
tions of Duquesne panned out?
For starters the team has had
trouble getting the ball to Bruce
Atkins. Atkins, a Sam-Clancy type

power forward with a much better‘

shooting touch than Clancy had, has
felt like a loner at times on the court.
The senior power forward has been
the victim of collapsing defenses
which make his power move inside a
rare occurence these days.

When a team has a player of

Atkins’ caliber, the offense can

become one dimensional.‘ Other
players devote most of their atten-
tion to feed the ball inside to him,
forgetting that to effectively feed the
inside, some outside shooting to
loosen up tight defenses is a problem
that came close to being rectified in
Monday’s win. .

1»... I I 4‘.-

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

A year ago, Darren Geary
wasn't even a member ofthe Pitt
men's track team. Garland
Brown was a wide-eyed fresh-
man not above quaking in his
spikes at big meets, while Terry
Gallagher was hampered by sev-
eral nagging injuries and Greg
Conover had little in common
with any of the other three
runners. Conover, you see, was
actually having a fairly good
season.

This year, as they proved last
week, the newly-assembled four-
some is the fleetest 2—m'ile relay
team in the nation by virtue of

their 7127.7 clocking at Satur-
day’s Eastman Invitational at
East Tennessee University. Their
first-place time has already qual-

' ified them forthe NCAA Nation-

als Mar. I3—I4 at the Silverdome
in Pontiac, Michigan.

What's equally remarkable is
that it’s the first time the quartet
ran together competitively this
year. And, while neither Brown,
Geary nor Pitt Coach Mike
Agostinella was surprised at the
team’s time~—a time which

_ makes them a frontrunner for the
All—America honors annually
bestowed on the NCAA’s top six
in each event—all three agree it
can only get better.

“They finished five or six
seconds ahead of the second-
place team. They’re much more
capable of running faster when
they’re pushed,” Agostinella
said. “Its an excellent start and a
good sign too. Now they won‘t
have to chase a (qualifying ) time
all season.”

lt’s that position of setting the
standards for other teams to

‘chase that especially pleased

Brown whose attitude has

changed “I00 percent” since he

. arrived at Pitt last year.

The Pitt Neiws, Wednesitlay,   I982

“Last year, we went to the
same meet, and I ran really
poorly. There were about 50 peo-
ple running the 800, and I was
terrified,” Brown recalled and
laughed. “I looked around and
saw guys I had on my wall at
home, people like Don Paige,
Steve Scott and Renaldo Nehe-
miah, all just sitting there. I fin-
ished last.” «

Since that early-career
fiasco—~ Brown saysjokingly that
he ran a 2:08 that day as com-
pared to the I:52 he now runs—
Brown has gained confidence
that accompanies winning. Bol-
stered by his success this past
summer in AAU competition,
Brown is over the jitters and
especially confident about the
immediate future of the 2-mile
relay team.

“I don’t think there’s a team in
the country that we can‘t run
with,” Brown said. “A quality
time this early makes you want to
do better and better. You get a
little hungry. Plus,.we’re more
committed this season'to getting
up in the morning to run, lift
weights and do the little extra
things you don‘t have to do—the
things that make the difference in
being champions.”

The return of Geary, after a
season-long absence from the
team last year due to what he
calls a “head problem", has per-
haps made the biggest difference
to the relay. Agostinella, a man
not quick to rave, last year called
Geary a potential “international
caliber” 800—meter man based on
Geary’s vast natural talent. and
torrid times. lt’s a billing Geary is
now hell-bent on earning.

“I honestly believe I have the
physical talent, the potential, to
make the U.S. 1984 Olympic
team,” Geary said. “That’s all I’m
working toward right now. I
have the desire.” In that season

Pitt’s two-mile relay team of (I. to rJTerry Gallagher, Garland Brown, Darren Geary,

Two-Mile Relay Now Ranks as Nation’s Best

and Greg Conover currently owns the nation’s top time in the event this year— and

the foursome expects to only improve as the season goes on.

off, Geary says he’ gained an
appreciation for the need for

desire, an attribute he thinks is

almost as mandatory as two
strong legs for a successful
runner. —

‘tlt all comes from attitude.

Leaving one season showed me-

how m.uch desire I do have to
run,”Geary said. “I realized I had
too much talent to waste. And it
showed over t-he weekend.”

Geary admitted the 2-mile
relay’s performance was espe-

cially gratifying since it was
recorded at one of the nation’s
most prestigious ‘meets, before
12,000 spectators.

“They (Brown, Conover and
Gallagher) made it easy for me.
They gave me the baton with a

.I0—yard lead in one ofthe biggest

indoor meets in the country, and
I ran, by myself, one ofthe fastest
splits ever run indoors,” Geary
said. “Our time this early doesn’t
surprise me. I know the potential
of the other three guys, and we
can only get better.”

The foursome has already
proved they're better than most;
Can best be far away‘?

Minik’s Loss Hurts
Team Against PSU

By SEAN BARNES

The Pitt Panther swimmers will
face a tough after-Christmas opener
as they travel to State College to
meet the Penn State Nitanny Lions.
Lewis is not-conceding defeat but the
deciding factor of the meet may be
the recent loss of —Pitt’s defending
Eastern champion diver, Mike

‘Minik. Although not on probation,
Minik decided his grades have
slipped too much and quit the diving
team. This was especially disturbing
to his coach, Julian Krug, who was
confident Minik could repeat as the
Eastern champ again this year and
earn NCAA All-America status.

“The timing of the loss was very
disappointing,” Krug said. “With
only one men’s diver left(Rex Nord-
heimer), I can only hope there is a
diver amongst the Pitt student body
that thought he could never make
our team. I feel bad also forthe swim
team. Now, they must notjust pick
up the points Minik would have got-

Although the diving situation
sounds bad, it has given Krug more

and it has given those divers a
greater sense of responsibility.

As for Lewis, he is expectinga lot
from his swimmers and he feels he’ll

Ladies Face PSU

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

The eager Pitt Lady Panther swim
team will happily exchange the
tedium of practice for some stiff
competition when they meet the
Penn State Lady Lions tomorrow at
State College.

Pitt, which last competed on Dec.
13 in a narrow loss to Michigan, is
coming off a month of heavy train-
ing that, even if most of it was done
in sunny Puerto Rico, has the team
“itching to get back and see how our
times go,” according to first-year
Pitt Coach Dave Belowich. “We got
in the (training) background that
will carry us through the rest of the
year.”

Belowich, though confident about

’_ ' the Lady Panthers’ chances tomor-
,{. row, inferred that Pitt will need

’ ’; whatever edge it can get against the

 improved Penn State team, a team
’/. coming off two recent, narrow

.  losses to Brown and defending East-

Mike Minik

:1-4-4-¥¥-¥«¥¥--V-V-I-1-¥¥¥¥¥¥

ern champion Princeton. Both
meets were not decided until the last
relay, according to Belowich, who
fully expects Penn State to swim

with a special interest in avenging an
earlier season loss to Pitt this year in
the Penn State Relays meet.

“it would be a feather in their cap
if they could beat us,” Belowich said.
“It could be very, very close all day.
It should be like flipping a coin and
seeing who the winner is.”

Besides the rivalry between the
two foes, there is also the little mat-
ter of last season’s Pitt win over the
Lady Lions, a win in which Pitt pre-
vailed, as Belowich eloquently put it,
in “a blow-away.”

The results could be quite differ-
ent tomorrow. While Pitt has a clear
edgewwith standouts like All-
Americas Amy Jackson, Jan Uje-
vich and Sue Heon—on capturing,
er. . . pardon the pun, the lion’s share
of first-place finishes, Penn State
should strongly challenge Pitt for
the second and third-place slots and
the valuable points that go into the
team scoring column.

“We can’t let down. They do have
the personnel, if we make a mistake,
to be right there,” Belowich said.

The Pitt Panther wrestling team,
coming off a big season opener win
over Youngstown last week, will test
the Marauders of Millersville this
Friday in Pitt’s first home match of
the year.

Last year’s match ended with Pitt
at the lower end of a 20- l 5 score, but '
this’ year may be a different story.
Although Millersville Head Coach

Jerry Swope will bring back three I

Millersville also has strength in

senior, Pitt’s Eric Harris (2-2).

At l77 pounds, Pitt will start

each had a basket in the first part of
a skein of 12 unanswered pointsthat
ended with three consecutive layups
by reserve guard Beth Tarasi. The
Lady Panther onslaught increased
their leading margin to 7l-40 with
five minutes remaining.

Once again, the Pitt veterans
made it possible for Saurer to give

..~- the reserves some playing time. and
once again the reserves responded
well. Along with Tarasi’s six points,
junior Lynn Love and freshmen Ste-
phanie Collins and Ellen Gilhooley
contributed four points each. Gil-
hooley also pulled down four
rebounds.

“The reserves are very supportive
of the people on the floor,” said
Saurer. “They come off the bench
with enthusiasm and they play hard.
That’s what a coach looks for, and
l’m very pleased that l’m seeing it.’‘

Lewis was eight-for-eight from

the field in the second half, giving
her a game-high 21 points. Bruce
contributed l5 and Miklasevich l0

alﬁoulled in l3 rebounds, while Gail

Aughburns collected l0.
For the second game in a row, a
Pitt team record was set. This timeit
was Aughburns, whose six blocked
shots gave the 6-3 center 2l4 for her
career, surpassing the career mark of

The coach expects some of the
_meet’s most hard-fought action to
come in the butterfly and diving
events, two of Penn State’s
strengths. Pitt is extremely strong in
the butterfly and rates an edge, but
making an accurate forecast for the
two diving events is more difficult.

“Penn State has five divers. and
they‘ll pick their three (competitors)
out ofthat five, depending on who is
hitting that day. It gives them an
advantage of having a little more
flexibility there," Belowich said. The

Penn State also showcases some

the team’s quality drops off in the
longer distance races unlike Pitt,
whose Sue Heon has excelled in the
early-going. At thie Michigan meet,
Heon posted national qualifying
times in two events en route to set-
ting five team and pool records.
“It seems like every time Sue

Both the opening and closing
events are relays, and_ both of Pius
arerespected nationally——~a strength
that could counter the sweep Penn
State should take in the two diving
events. The rest of the meet will
probably be a tight, hotly contested
fight for places and points.

“It could be a one mistake meet,”
remarked Lewis. “Our seniors-~
Rick Carter, Sandy Pidgeon, Greg
Pelton, Don Keer and Bill Pierce-—
will have to be swimming the hardest

they have since they‘ve been on our _

team.“

Not only will Pitt be swimming
hard just to determine the meet’s
outcome, but also to beat the
national cutoff times. Pitt has only
four meets left in which to qualify
for NCAA Eastern Regionais or
Nationals, whereas most other
teams have six or more. lt should be
an exciting meet with a packed
house at Penn State. The Panthers
just barely-overcame them at home
last year at Trees Hall Pool in the
final relay. The final score was 59-
54.

The Panthers hit the road for two
more consecutive weekends as they
battle LaSalle on Jan. 23. and thena
strong rival, the WVU Mountaineer
team. on Jan. 30. t

Quicksilver guard Darrell Gissendanner’s defensive
hounding oi Duquesne’s young guards could be a key to

victory ior Pitt tomorrow night.

Duquesne to win, Harris has to hit
those outside shots.

A sagging defense’s worst enemy
is a good shooter.

One problem that Duquesne
hasn’t had is rebounding.’ Rhode
Island was the first team to outre-
bound the Dukes. It is a‘ strength
that Chipman is very aware ,of.

“Like l said earlier in the year, we
are very limited. Its not that were
not boxing out against Rutgers, Roy
Hinson was going over Steve Beatty
to grab rebounds,” Chipman said.

Chipman’s lament is well
founded. Clyde Vaughan, a 6-4 for-
ward, has been Pitt’s leading
rebounder. Aga-inst GW; Vaughan
pulled down 16 rebounds, while the
next highest total was a mere five by
Roosevelt Kirby.

Whilevaughan has done a yea-
man’s job off the glass, he cannot
always be expected to keep burly
forwards like Duquesne's Atkins
and Joey Meyers off the boards.
Some help is needed, especially from
Pitt’s other front court players.

The reason is simple: no matter
how good a defense your playing, if

a team allows Atkins or Meyers to

Bruce Atkins
plant themselves under the basket
you can bet on watching a game,
called Taps—all night long. 1/
Going into the game with a
decided disadvantage off the boards
may force Chipman to order a press
against Duquesne’s guards. In last
year's second Pitt-Duquesne game
(which Pitt lost), Chipman utilized a
full-court press which not only
helped-bring the Panthers back from
awl6 point deficit, _but totally frus-

trated the then freshman guard
Andy Sisinni. Sisinni was s o frus-
trated that, upon fouling out, he
made some uncomplimentary hand
gestures to a disgruntled crowd.
Chipman admits the ides had
occurred to him, but... ‘
“Yes, l think Duquesne’s guards
can be pressed, but then again l
thought George Washington‘s
guards could be pressed.” Chipman
said. You know how that worked--—
GW’s Wilbert Skipper responded
with 24 points. '

against George Washington.
Duquesne’s young guards (Farrell is
a freshman and Sisinni is just a
sophomore) will probably be more
susceptible to pressure from super-
quick Darrell Gissendannner, who
dismantled Sisinni last year, and
Dwayne Wallace.

Pitt is very quick and impressive.’
But we’ll come out running and we
feel we can run with anybody in the
Eastern 8," Farrell said.

While Farrell’s statement may
include some freshman cockiness,.it
is nevertheless true that his coach,
Rice, woiild prefer a running-type

ballgame. It is the kind of game thataﬁgi;

Chipman would be all too happpy to
have, for the second-year Pitt coach
has no apprehension about his
team‘s»ability to run. g

A fast,-paced ballgame could ease
up some ofthe rebounding pressures
off Pitt. Roy Chipman wouldn't
mind that at all.

At l9O freshman Frank Vulcano

Panther Coach Rande Stottlem—
yer expects an exciting‘ match with
several ‘very close contests. Said
Stottlemyer, “I feel confident that
we can beat them , but those toss-
ups will decide it.” I

It is an important match for the
Panthers. Besides being the first
home match, and the first league
match of the season, for Pitt, a win
over Millersville, presently ranked
tenth in the East, could win Pitt
some recognition .

The match is set for 7:30 this Fri-
day night at the Field House.

It just seemed so ”Hollywood.”
Here's Warren Beatty, premier play-
boy of the Western World. best
remembered as the blowdryer king
or bhampoo, teaming up with Diane
Keaton, who never seems to be able
to blow her air—head Annie Hall image,
to tell us the story of the Russian
Revolution. Then the ‘rumors
began——Reds was turning out to be
the Heavens Gate of 1981, with $20
million turning into $30 million, and

$40 million and on and on....

Well Reds is very Hollywood, but in
the best sense of the word. It has as
much passionate spirit, sweeping
drama, and adverturous intelligence
as the best old fashioned Hollywood
epics. If this doesn't put Beatty’s play-
boy image to rest nothing will, for
he's not only shown heis a fine actor,
but an incredibly gifted director.

Reds is basically a domestic drama
about the troubled relationship
between journalistv_a.nd communist
John Reed (he wrote Ten Days That
Shook the World) his wife Louise Bryant
and the social upheavels of America
as it entered World War I. By con-
stantly interweaving "these
upheavals—the emergence of com-
munism, feminism and the Bohemian
movement with the Reeds’personal
lives Reds masterfully portrays an
America in transition.

Beatty, who not only stars as Reed.
but also directed, produced and co-
wrote the screenplay with Trevor
Griffiths, is able to capture the ten-
sions of these transformations per-
fectly. Scenes of the growing labor

movement and the emergence of the.

communist party in America sweat
with tension. But the film truly
becomes an epic when Reed and Bry-
ant go to Russia to witness the
revolution.
V Half a dozen scenes literally take
your breath away as Beatty sweeps
us through the tumultuous revolu-
tion, with the anthem ”The Internati-
onale” spurring the film on. Beatty
makes it look easy b ;- - ' . -

Ken Shapiro's addition to this

year's (actually last year's) barrage of
holiday movies, Modern Problems, is full’

' of just that——problems. What starts
out't_o be a potentiallyhilarious flick
quickly dissipates into an unfunny
imitation of Abbott and Costello Get
Nuked.

The story begins when an‘ air-
traffic controller (Chevy Chase) loses
his wife (Patti D'Arbanville) because
of his over-protectiveness towards
her. In order to ease his sorrow Chase
seeks the company of his ex (Mary
Kay Place). To add to-his frustration,
Chase frequently sees his wife in the
company of Barry, an ex-friend.
While returning home from a party,
where he once more sees Barry and
his wife in addition to watching his ex

' friendlinvalid, Chase is contaminated
"with nuclear waste that is spilled in

through his sun roof from a leaking
truck. This "baptism of fire" imbues
Chase with telekinetic powers, and
the remainder of the movie deals
wit‘l1.the.7m.ayhem that resultsgvyj 

ifs-

films, has a director thrown his
audience into the upheaval in such a
dramatic way. _

Beatty’s brash use of the larger pol-
itical arena to reflect the lives of the
Reeds works so well because their
personal lives are as dramatic as the
events swirling around them.
Another technique Beatty uses,_32
”witnesses” who reminisce about the
Reedsand their times works remar-
kable well. Not only do these wit-
nesses add a touch of history and
reality, but they also put the film into
historical context. It's daring of
Beatty to tur1"ftx~=—"e romantic passions
the‘ Reeds lived by into funny little
anecdotes, but it works marvelously,
and only makes Beatty’s directoral
skills more obvious.

John Reed's reputation as a radical
journalist has already been made
when he meets Louise Bryant (Kea-
ton), the wife of a Portland dentist
who is trying desperately to be
Bohemian. Reed takes her to Green-
wich village,'where his commitment
grows while Bryant's fails miserably.
His friends, including Emma Gold-
man (played grandly‘ by Maureen Sta-

pleton) and Max Eastman (Edward
Hermanngives just the right touch as
a smug intellectual) -squeeze her out
of their tight circle because she does
nothing to prove herself. The com-

turns Bryant into a rather whining
complainer and we soon begin to lose
sympathy for her.

Our loyalties to Bryant are ambig-

uous. She is trying to live by her phi-
losophies, butshe lacks the courage
to do so. She blames Reed for her own
inadequacies,‘ and does nothing to
earn the respect she obstinately
demands from him. When she begins
an affair with playwright Eugene
O'Neill, played with a marvelous cyn-
icism by Jack Nicholson, she's clearly
out of her element.

O'Neill tests Bryant's belief in free
love, constantly questioning and
badgering her, which only makes
Bryant appear more hypocritical and
ambiguous. He is used to great effect
to question the ideals the Reeds hold
so dear, but unfortunately he does
not confront Reed, so it throws the
balance of the film out of sync.

Diane Keaton just doesn't have the
star quality to make us understand or
sympathize with Bryant. A stronger
actress could have made us under-
stand what Reed and O'Neill saw in
her, while at the same time strug-
gling with her own insecurities. Its
hard to take Keaton seriously, until
well intothe film, but by then it's
almost too late.» .

On the other hand Beatty plays
Reed with a boyish charm, which cap-

‘ tures our loyalties and keeps hold of

them. He is zealous and talented, but

   
  
 

' at‘the same ‘time vulnerable, so his

strident political beliefs are
acceptable.

Beatty’s intentions become clear
when Bryant must go into Russia,
which is impenetrable during the civil
war, to find Reed, who has been
imprisoned by the Finns. Finally put-
ting her commitments to the test
Bryant finds the courage she has
been lacking, faces up-to her own vul-
nerabilities, and we come to respect
her. This transformation is trium-
phant because not only O'Neill, but
the film itself has so relentlessly, and
brutally attacked Bryant._ Keaton has
the most complex role in the film, and
although we still have doubts about ‘
her at the end, she redeems herself
beautifully.

‘Set against all of this of ‘course is
the Russian Revolution, and Beatty
joyously exploits it to the/ fullest.
There is nothing political about it, it
goes beyond politics and Beatty
wisely avoids polemics about the ulti-

mate repression that strangled the '

original spirit of the revolution.

Instead he subtly uses the growing,
bureacracy of the Bolshevik regime
to foreshadow the death of the revo-
lution. Novelist Jerzy Kosinsky (Being
There, The Painted Bird) masterfully
playsthe fast talking bureacrat Gri-
gorii Zinoviev who effectively kills
the passion that spurred Reed and
others on. Set against the glorious
scenes of Russia, which beautifullyr
reflects the vaseness and emotions of
the country, and the memory of
Reed's futile attempts to develop a
communist party in America, this
pervading bureacracy is almost

heartbreaking. A

This monumental film, though ‘cast ‘
with a decided radical, tint, is strik-
ingly similar to Gone With the Wind in
the emotions it stirs in the audience.

I If it had had a stronger leading lady it

could even have surpassed Gone With
the Wind, but nonetheless Reds is easily
the best epic to come out of Holly-
wood in 40 years.

he uses these powers to wreak havoc

and revenge.
Unfortunately, the movie

doesn't work. Once more Chase is
trapped in a movie that wastes his
talents in boring and listlessways.
The rest of the cast is convincing but
the script isn't. It's like a dog with a
respiratory problem——-it starts out at
full speed_but quickly lays down and
pants.

The beginning of the movie is quite
funny. There are some great air-
traffic controller gags; Chase is at his
best bumbling self, andin one off-
beat restaurant scene, Chase causes

Barry to have a nosebleed that turns --

into a gushing hemorrhage. How-
ever, after this episode the laughs are
sparse. The viewer is left waiting for
humor that doesn't exist. Ultimately,
the movie becomes a‘ ‘ senseless
hodgepodge of slapstick humor that
the Three Stooges have done
before—and much more humor-.
ously, I might add.

So, if the craving is for humor,

By LESLIE .VAN BUSKIRK

THE SET—UI’

Being in the same room with
Bow Wow Wow is sort of. like
being at the circus;it's fright-
ening in a way, but really
entertaining and funny, and
you keep waiting_ for someone

non. .

I found myself in just such a
position a scant two minutes
after their performance at
’Heaven had ended. The con-
cert was great, though» there
weren't enough people there to
satisfy me, probably due to it
being a cold, snowy night with
the icy streets leading to the
downtown disco untouched by
salt crews. I must admit that I
hadn't expected to enjoy the
show as much as I did. Like alot
of/American music watchers, I
was skeptical of such a trendy
British band; BWW's singer,
Annabella is scarcely 16, and,
yet, she's already a rock 'n roll
covergirl (just look at the cover
of this magazine...) with an
armful of well-publicized sto-
ries: her Burmese refugee sta-

to come shooting out of a can-'

 

tus, her ”di_scovery" in an
English laundromat, her
mother who objects to all the
hoopala, and on and on and
on...The biggest hype, how¥
ever, is the band's association
with Malcolm McLaren, the
Kim Fowley of England.
McLaren well—known‘for the
launchings of several of the
world's faddier bands, espe-
cially Adam & The Ants, also
put together Bow ~Wow Wow.
He and the Wows have been
accused of using the band as a
plaything, a way to express

' McLaren's own personal ideas
’ and opinions, however trivial

or dumb they may seem. And
many of them are just that. I
mean, really , all this garbage
about home taping and being
banned byall sorts of govern-
ment agencies and declaring
unemployment as the way to
go, well, it's all just so
much...garbage.

So, seeing. them live was
quite a surprise because they're
not all hype———they’ve really got
some backbone. While the
”deeper" meanings of the

Photos _ By THOMAS JEFFERSON

songs ought to be ignored, the

music  itself is wonderfully
exciting. The tribal stuff is car-
ried a step further with BWW

than with the obvious compari-A

son of Adam & Co. Songs like
”]ungle Boy" and the instru-
mental ”Orang—Outang," both
Burundi beaters, sounded just
as good in concert as-they do on
the album (See junglef See Iunglel
G0 ]0in Your Gang Yeah! City All
Over, Go Ape Crazy./).

The stand-out of the perfor-
mance, though, was Annabella.
Running about with total
abandon, she sang, danced, and
smiled her way into your heart.

Despite what we've all heard

about her, she's a real enter-
tainer who deserves to be
where she is. '

T’ Anyway, getting back to the
story, I find myself in an oh—so—
posh room on the upper level of
Heaven surrounded by the
members of BWW: Matt Ash—
man (guitar), Leroy Gorman
(bass), Dave Barbarossa
(drums), Annabella, of course,
the band's" two dancers, B00
and Fuffi (honestl), their

much-abused tour manager,
Andy Corrigan, and assorted
hangers on.’ Spying Annabella
at the far end of the. bar fiddling
with a piano, I head her way,
not knowing what to expect; a
spoiled, bratty teenager, per-
haps? (I'm half—hoping thism'.s.«
what’ I'll find, so that I could :1 
the interview, be soundly
offended, and write a properly
vicious story. All in a night's
work; you know!) Hardly.

What I discover instead, is a‘
young woman (photographs

  

don't do her justice) who's

nobody's fool. Some of her rep-
lies were a bit curt, but you can
chalk that up to the fact that
she had a bad cold and wanted

to get some much needed rest.

THE INTERVIEW

How did you think the show went
tonight?

Terrible! I ,mean, it's
embarassing——-not that many
people and hardly any of them
dancing. Don't they like us
here?

 

‘. J‘.".4

Well, yes, Imean no...uh, Ithink it's
the weather and the fact that it's hard
for kids to get in here; good fake ID.
isn't easy to come by.

You mean kids aren't allowed
to get in?!?

No, you have to be 21...

You're kidding! I think that's
awful! (Annabella then cross"-
examines the road manager as to why
they booked at such a place) Listen,
let's go sit over here (motioning to
some furniture on the other side of the
room); can I get you anything?
(Am I hearing things?) Uh, no, I'm
fine. Let's see now, why don't we start
off with your childhood...

Oh, no! why would anyone
want to know about that? No, I

don't want to talk about it——it.

was very boring.

(Okay, I'll try a different approach)‘
Do you really like what you're doing? '

Is it a job or a career? V_
Of course I like it!,I mean,
what kinds of question is that? I

wouldn't bedoing it‘ if I didn't _
like it! I hope it's a career——I,

can't imagine doing anything

“else. Besides I can't do any-

thing else...I wasn't good at
schoolwork...I mean, what

- good is it?«You go there for all ‘A

these years and they ask you
what you learned by reading a

bunch of books; they give you -

all these tests...it’s just so
bloody stupid!'I droppedout
and I'm much better off, I mean
just use fuckin' common sense!
(Gee, maybel shouldn't tell her that
I'm from a collegemagazinel Come
on, now, tell me the truth, wereiyou
really discovered by Malcolm in a

 laundromat? -
No, actually it was a dryclean-

ers, and I originally said, "No, I
can't sing" because I thought
Malcolm was trying to pick me
up. Then some girlfriends of
mine found out that he really
was who he said, so I joined up.

Is it true that you were kicked out of _
Bow Wow Wow before?

‘Yeah, I was, but I don't really
know why. I guess I wasn't

working hard enough and they
thought, "Oh, she's just a
schoolgirl," so they tossed me
out. .

Any chance of them doing thdf again?
No, I work as hard as everyone
else. This isn't easy, all this
touring, recording, rehear-
singfjespecially rehearsing,
which I just hate. But I don't
really mind, I like it; being on
the road isn't so bad because I
get bored easily, so when I'm at
home, there's nothing much to
do and I go crazy! ,
What kind of reaction have you been
getting from American audiences as
opposed to English ones? ’

Well, we expected the Ameri-
can audiences to be a lot less
inhibited, which they are-
some of them, anyway. But,
like tonight, onlya-few people
near the front were dan-

cing...hey, I saw you on the
stairs, how come you weren't
dancing?

(Deciding never again to wear clothes

that stick out in a crowd} Uh, I was

taking lots of notes; (changing the sub-
ject quickly) What do you like best
about America? M

Its -sandwiches.

Sandwiches??

Yes, especially thick, turkey
sandwiches. T,

(Uh, right, anything you say) How do

you feel about being called a band

that's here today, gone tomorrow?
You mean that hype thing?
Well, we're not a gimmick. The

" whole thing with Malcolm has

been both good and bad;
because of it we got into the
limelight much quicker than
most bands, and were able to
tour and put out records
quickly..But we've also had to
prove ourselves, probably peo-

ple have been more critical of '

us because of our becoming

/famous in such ashortlength

of time, so we have to go out
and work doubly hard to prove
that we're not justa gimmick.
(fast then, Dave Barbarossa sits down
next to Annabella and gives me a

rather frightening look. Glancing at ‘

his biceps, I instantly decide not to
interview (him and to get away from
here as soon as possible.) Last question,

’ Annabella, what are your long-range

goals? . e ‘

That's easy, to keep on doing
what I'm doing now, and to be
very rich and happy.

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

With the scores of movies released
during the holiday season, you'd
expect to find several of them worth-

-. while, perhaps just one~half of them.

But with the exception of Reds and
possibly Ragtime, Tinseltown’s latest
crop is full of rotten apples. Few are
barely coherent, much less worth the
ticket price or the muscle pain you'll
surely encounter if you manage to sit
through any of them. Pennies From
Heaven, for example, is an absolute
disaster. Not able to make up its mind
as to whether it's a musical, a comedy,
or a drama, it stutters, stumbles and
finally falls——and all within the first
30 minutes! The story line isimpossi-
ble and ill—conceived; see if you can
follow this: a travelling salesman
(Steve Martin) during the Depres-
sion, who longs for excitement,
leaves his mousey, frigid wife (Jessica
Harper, who looks like a worn-out
washrag) and falls in love with a vir-
gin, small-town teacher (Bernadette
Peters). After deflowering her, he
returns to his wife and opens a
money—losing record store, where he
once again dreams of a better life.

’One day he runs into the school

teacher, who became pregnant in the
interim, was fired from her job, got
an abortion and is now a hooker.

(Whew!) He leaves his wife for the
second time to find true happiness

‘with the hooker, only to find his

happiness short-lived when the law
comes after him for the murder of a
beautiful, blind girl. But he didn't kill
her; we assume that a black, street-
corner musician did it, but we're not
really sure, and even if he did murder
her, we have no idea why. In between
this so—called ”plot,” there are song
and dance numbers ripped straight
out of Busby Berkeley which are
spliced in whenever and wherever
someone (the director? producer?
Steve Martin?) felt like it. Old musi-
cals, like those of the Fred Astaire-
» inger Rogers group, or even

 Saturday Night Fever, should have been

studied by Pennies From Heaven's Crea-
tors tor a better understanding of
how to incorporate music and dance

Ragtime begins in the same viva-
cious spirit as the novel. It opens with
a close—up of a black ragtime pianist’s
hands playing the keyboard to the
flitting images of a newsreel. It is an
appropriate beginning, effectively
evoking the period. The film then
expands. Grand images sweep across
the screen; a host of characters, fic-

Ttional and non-fictional, emerge and

their storiesare intertwined into the
intricate weavings of a larger story.
There are moments of great passion
and momentsof subtle affect yielding
the promise of an extraordinary
movie experience.

Unfortunately this promise is not
fulfilled. Director Milos Foreman
(One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and
Hair) and his screenwriter Michael
Weller eventually decide to center the
story on the ragtime pianist Coal-

l:f.,house Walker and his rage against the

injustices done to him by a group of
white men. Coalhouse, played by
Howard Rollins, embarks on a spree

.of murders and bombings and even-
tually, takes hold of. the . Morgan

into a film.

‘sion of The Young And The Restless.

Barely «3 few minutes into the
movie, Steve Martin utters,”...1 like

feeling empty." Fine, but why punish
your audience with the same hollow
torture?

Jane Fonda is thought of as an
actress who can be counted on to
make reasonably good, and some-
times even great, pictures. But, as
evidenced by Rollover, that's just
another myth. Rollover is a tedious
movie about high finance ‘-‘and rom-
ance that seems like a two hour ver-

As a former movie star turned pet-
rochemical heiress, Jane Fonda makes
a half-attempt at pretending like she
knows‘ what she's doing, but fails
miserably. ' Bogged down under a
soap—opera script and draped in
clothes too fancy for royalty, her
character is simply too unreal to take
seriously.

America's most unlikely leading
man, Kris Kristofferson, plays her
love interest with the same phoni-
ness that colors the entire movie.
Suffice it to say that Kristofferson as
a Wall Street wizard(he still has his
hokey drawl and cowboy gait) is bad
casting, to put it mildly. S

The story line here is as confusing
as Pennies From Heaven's and trying to
explain it could only cause irreverable
brain damage. As a bad movie with
big stars, it will probably attract a few
fans, but it certainly doesn't deserve
to....No one ever expects good movies
from Burt Reynolds, and Sharlcy's _
Machine is no exception. Much more
grisly than previous flicks like Smokey
And The Bandit and The Cannonball Run’,
its yet another story about New York ,
police officers, crime kingpins, psy
chopathic killers, and high class cal
girls. Hardly original. Reynolds acts
the way he usually does: cute, boyish
and cheeky, but Rachel Ward is fine
as the beautiful $1000 a nighthooker
he falls in love with. If you're at al
offended by excessive violence and
gore——characters are blown to bits
every few minutes and their remains
are then splattered all over the set-—
and, well, even if you're not, do your-
self a favor ‘and stay away from
Sharlcy's 1\/iarhine....

 

 

 

 

Library threatening to blow it up if
his demands are not met. The film
dwells on this matter until the very
end and loses the grandeur it evoked
in the beginning. It becomes little
more than a story of black revenge. It
also becomes predictable and quite

unbelievable.

Foreman and Weller have stripped
E.L. Doctorrow’s novel down to what
they apparently believe to be the bare
essentials,‘ leaving out several impor-
tant characters and (episodes, and
decided to dwell sole'ly'c‘m the" story of

 

Coalhouse W.all<er's revmge, with
Evelyn Nesbit's rise to fame as Amer-
ica’s first Sex Goddess as a subplot.
The decision is no surprise, for sex
and violence is what sells the tickets.
Obviously ticket sales is producer
Dino DeLaurentiis' main concern.

Robert Altman was De Laurentiis’
first choice for director, but was
replaced when apparently he was not
making the film De Laurentiis
wanted. Altman had spent quite
some time collaborating with Doctor-
row in trying to transcribe his bust-
ling novel to the screen and one can-

not help but wonder what they might
have accomplished. Altman was the
perfect choice to direct the film, his
1975 film Nashville being his main
recommendation.

But despite the fact that Foreman's
film is ultimately disappointing, there
are many aspects to recommend it.
There are indeed fine moments, due
mainly to the many fine perfor-
mances from the cast. In the lead is
Rollins, an exceptional newcomer

_whn delivers a fine and effective por-

trait of Coall ouse Walker. Then
there is Debbie Allen as Walker's
wife, who dies defending him, Mary
Steeriburger. and James Olsen as the
leaders of a white family that
befriend Coalhouse before he is pro-
vokecl to anger, and Elizabeth
McGovern, who displays ample dip-
piness as the airheaded Sex Goddess,
i ’.'.'l_\~’h l\l€Sl)ll:.

One might feel a bit of anger at the
...!-.l.(‘Cl potential of this project, lcer-
minly did. But rather than lament
over the failings of the film, I feel it
can be recommened for the good
moments that it does offer.

FREEZE-FRAME
I. GEILS BAND
EMI

The I. Geils Bands’ Freeze-
Frame arrives like yet another
flank of the cavalry that
returned home in 1981 to retake
the fort. Freeze-Frame reaffirms
what works as diverse as The
Rolling Stones’ Tattoo You and
Smokey Robinson’s'Being With
You boldly confirmed-that no
contradiction exists between

growing old and rock’n roll. If
anything, Geils and Co. have
shown that the arrival of
middle-age often welcomes a
resurgence of the human spirit
needed to . fuel rock’n roll
dreams.

Freeze—Frame prances about
with a devil-may-care penache
that new wavers grapple for but
rarely find. The I. Geils Band
have seemingly found a niche
where it's all right to reminisce,
revolt, and rock’n roll without
the need for self-indulgence or
the fear of pretense.

Seth Iustman fills the credits
as sole or co-writer of all nine
tunes and also takes bows for
production and arrangements.
Side one kicks the gate with the

Hail Hail Rock And Roll

upbeat rap of the title track and
for the next thirty-five or so
minutes Geils and band stand
and deliver a concoction of
blitzkrieg rythyms and street-
corner soul somehow rescued
out of their greaser roots, a
splash of techno-pop, and the
salvagable remains of disco’s
quiet remission. The intangible

ingredient here has gotto be the
seasoning of many years on the
road which has driven this
group to a new level of musi-
cianship and studio mastery.
Even the potato chip hit single
”Centerfo-ld” succeeds where
similar attempts (e.g, ”Miss

You,” Emotional Rescue) led their
British counterparts to the edge

of nausea.

Standouts on the album
include ”Do You Remember
When,” an elaborate arrange-
ment which sways with early
Motown harmonies, and
”Insane, Insane Again,” high-
lighted by Geils’ fibrilating gui-
tar and some spastic drumwork.
Side two opens with the exotic
"River Blindness," a pulsating
opera which oozes from the
haunting din of ]ustman's key-
boards only to erupt into Geils'
seering lead. The best cut, how-
ever, is ”Angel In Blue,” which
could stare a Springsteen ballad
straight in the mirror with a
perfect reflection. The marriage

, of icy cool keyboards and acous-

‘ tic 12-string back the ever-
present youthful angst of the
lyrics: There were guys she could
number/Bat none she had known/And
she never had dreams‘/So they never
came true.

By the time the needle skates
off of side two, Freeze-Frame has
reached temperatures that
would melt the gay apparel of
most New Wave offerings. This
is possibly the best TRUE rocker
since Petty's Damn The Torpedoesl
TODD ERKEL

GREAT WHITE NORTH
Bob and Doug McKenzie
Polydor

G’day, eh? Like, hey all you

hosers put on your tuques
because Bob and Doug McKen-
zie of Second City and the Great
White North have an album out,
and like--so that makes them a
group, eh?

Like the album is funny, ok
hoser? It's a take-off on all those
wilderness shows like the ones
you see on Saturday afternoon
on those independent UHF
channels right after the cheap
Japanese ~inonster movie and
Woodworkers Corner. So, like eve-
ryone wears a plaid hunting
jacket and a tuque, but like you
can't see them because it's an
album, eh? But still everyone
talks like a hosehead and there
are lots of beauty jokes about
beer and backbacon; and oh

yeah, beer and tuques and cof—.

fee sandwiches. Then, like Bob

~ and Doug" talk about all these

worthless subjects and even
interview YOU!

it that's not enough, hoser,

Bob and Doug do a beauty ver— «

sion of "Twelve Days of Christ-
mas” (only they really do only
seven) and Geddy Lee gets paid
ten dollars to do "Take-off"
that's like bound to be a plati-
num seller-—at least in Canada.

"So like if you think Second

, City is funny or if you like how
Canadians talk, or if you like
‘pump loads ‘on’ beauty jokes’,

about beer and backlgaconthen
buy Great White North, eh?--’
because like nowjthat Bob and

I  e .Doug are a group‘ they have to

pay their roadies and back-up
singers or all cops will be after
them. So take off hoser...

SHAKE IT UP
The Cars
Elektra

Reaffirmation. Yes, that's the
feeling after listening to the
Cars new one, Shake It Up. No
doubt this album signals the
group's return to basics--their
own basics.

Whereas, on Panorama, The
Cars drifted off on a musically
monosyllabic tangent, Shake It
Up marks a return to the womb
for some more of the musical
style that made their first album

and Candy-O (less so)'so damn .

infectious. _
Of course, the album contains
the usual Cars’ trademark of Kit?
Ocasek’s liquidly bizarre lyrics
that oddly enough, as Musician
Magazine puts it, ”seem to make
sense.” The abstract quality of
Ocasek’s songs are enough to
make Picasso's corpse jealous.
- Yet, the album's calling card is
its music. It's this year's model
of that stuff that made "My Best
Friend's Girl," ”The Dangerous
Type," and ”Let The Good
Times Roll" so irresistible. It's
futuristic yet fifty-ish; dance-
able yet emotionless...it’s the
Cars.

S0 for Cars fans and just plain
music—lovers, Shake It Up is posi-
tively an album to consider
strongly. Put it this way, if Pano-
rama was a 1981 Chrysler then
Shake It Up would be an '82.'Edsel.

ROUND TRIP
The Knack
Capitol

The Knack has always been a
strictly soda pop? band-—hits
popped out of them like cans of
coca-cola, filled with sugar,
indulged in by mostly prepubes-
cent teenagers, but with a

somewhat nasty fizz. Well
somebody threw a little rum
into_ the Coke and the- result,
Round, Trip is, well...a trip.

As the title implies, The
Knack mean to take us some-
where beyond the smug,
smutty past of  but the lifilegirls
understand, and this in itself is
encouraging. Instead of Doug
Fieger's perverse pedophilic

fantasies we get an almost intel- ’

lectual, or even a psychedelic
feel, which amounts to about
the same thing in pop music.

Despite a few paisley print
rip-offs of the Beatles, circa '
1967 (like "We Are Waiting")
Round Trip contains some excel-

lent material. "Lil' Cals Big Mis-
A take" is the ultimate ”Humphry
Bogart in L.A.” songfwhile

 

"Another Lousy Day in Para-

dise” and "Pay the Devil" are the
K'nack’s own two—scene version
of Faust; (Everyhody's got to read the
reviews/ooo baby ooo even you/ Got ‘to
learn to give the devil his due.) It is
nice to see the Knack eat hum-
ble pie, and Imust say, they do it
quite well.

There is only one "knack
song, the obnoxious ”Boys Go
Crazy,” which only stands out
because Doug Fieger claims not
to be a chauvinist in it, which is,
in its own way, quite hilarious.

All in all the Knack isstill like
soda pop; it tastes good, and you
can drink as much as you want
without being affected. Round
Trip won't get adolescents

/flushed and nervous, but it goes
down smoothly just the same.

MSG
Michael Schenker Group
Chrvsalis

The trouble with a lot of
heavy metal albums is that they
get monotonous. There is rarely
anything fresh on them; they
never catch the excitement of
the-‘heavy’, metal group in
concert. I  " ' ‘

j The Michael Schenker
Group's MSG album is an excep- ,

tion. Schenker's guitar sounds
are ALWAYS fresh? He has a
way of taking hold of a guitar
and letting his fingers set the

strings on fire. All the tunes on

'MSG have ‘great guitar work,
and fine musical touches by the
rest of the band as well.

A All eight songs on the album
are good. ”Are You -Ready To
Rock” starts the disc on at high
that never lets down. The
second tune, "Attack Of The
Mad ~ Axeman," has sneaky,
dangerous-sounding- vocals,
and sums up (the approach of

Schenker and his band, "On

 

And On" and ”Let Sleeping
Dogs Lie’? close out- side one by
making you want, to listen to _it
again. \

Side two opens with "But I
Want More," a solid, hard-

, hitting rocker. ”Never Trust A

Stranger,” the next cut, is
slower and slightly mellowed.
"Stranger" is more vocally-
oriented, with Stephen'Stills
and Billy Nicholls guesting to
help out Gary Barden,
Schenker's vocalist, while
”Looking For Love" and "Secon—
dary Motion," are a couple of
real ‘butt-kickers.

“On MSG the band is
extremely tight; Chris Glenn

(bass), Cozy Powell (drums),

and Paul Raymond (keyboards
& guitars) lay down the perfect
backdrop for Schenker's
screaming guitar and Barden's
vocals. "On And On"gives Ray-
mond a chance to show his stuff
on the boards; Powell and Glenn
are the much needed adhesive
that transform MSG into a fine

' musical album, instead of just a

fine guitar album.

wHo's LANDING IN MY  

HANGAR?

Human Switchboard
I.R.S.

If, like me, you're bored with

faddy t'echno—electro pop our »

A. dear cousins have been shipping
to us across the Atlantic and sick
of the bruises you discover after
a ,Black Flag encounter, there's

- hope yet. A trio of saviors has

arrived called Human Switch-
board.Who's Landing In My Han-
gar? -might easily be the best
debut album by any band during
the post—punk interim of the
past few years. Everything
here-——from the lyrics to the
vocals to the music itself—
smacks of one—in—a-million orig-
inality and true beliefs. This
band isn',t merely doing justice
to the concept of rock ‘n roll,
they're redefining it and setting
new standards for it.

\

Although the Switchboard,

has only three full-fledged
members (Myrna Marcarian,
Robert Pfeifer, and Ron Metz)
there is surely no lack of imagi-
nation and talent. Pfeifer wrote
‘all of the cuts here, except for
two co-written with Marcarian,
and they're all devastating. The

unusual vocal deliveries have a A

lot to do with Hnngar's sucess,
Pfeifer and Marcarian sharing
credit in this department, also.
His is a hyper screamer's voice
that's used on most of the faster
numbers, like the titletrack,
while hers is rich, emotive-just
right for the slower songs. Mar-
carian's phrasing is unusual,
too; just listen to the inflections
‘she puts into "(Say No To)
Saturday's Girl,” ”Where The
Light Breaks," and especially on
her startling duet with Pfeifer,
"Refrigerator Door.” ,
There's a lot more that could
be saidyabout Human Switch-
board and Who's Landing In Mu
Hrmgar?, but why bother? When
somethings’ this incredihle,

CHANGESTWOBOWIE
David Bowie

‘ RCA

 Definitive. Bowie? Well

maybe but I'm not too sure...
Greatest .Hits? Well, OK, as
long as it's not taken too"li"ter-
ally. I know—"B'eginrier's Bowie
Part Two...” I "

David Bowie was not meant
to be collected in singles or in a
compilation of "singles.” One
has to listen to all of Aladdin Sam:
or Ziggy Stardust to realize the
excellence of this esoteric yet
diverse performer. .

Practically all of the cuts on
the albumare what's considered
”good.” Actually, that_’s all been
established before for an album

of this nature. The album picks '
_ up where CHANGE5ONEBO-
WIE_left off so to’ speak. The p

album cuts are "Aladdin Sane
(1913-1938-197.7)/' "Oh! You

Pretty Things," "Starman/’ ‘I

"1984," "Ashes To Ashes,”
"Sound And Vision,” "Fashion/’

”Wild Is The Wild,’’ ”]ohn I'm A

Only Dancing (Again) 1975,”
and "DJ." ‘

But can you really just take a
bunch of ”best—selling" Bowie
songs and, put them on an
album? I don't think so. For as

  
   

performer like

songs are but different parts of

different wholes. When these
songs are mixed on a compila-

tion album it's like mixing dif— 
feren~t atoms of different 1

molecules: the end result is just
not the same. A mutant ' is
produced.

However, despite these aes-
thetic ravings of a rock n’ roll
zealot the album can have some
objective value. Most obviously,
for those AM/AOR groupies

(the same as listening to DVE or .
— -YDD here), the album has all

 

those songs" like "1984" and V '

"Ashes To Ashes" that will be
familiar to the little pinherads.
Secondly, a lot of good Bowie

albums like Aladdin Sane or Pinups-

or Ziggy Stardust are becoming
increasingly difficult to find. So

for the Bowie newcomer,

CH/INGESTWOBOWIE and
CH/INGESONEBOWIE might
be used as temporary pacifying
devices until the albums can be
obtained. Finally, for those who
don't ‘know Bowie beyond
"Fame" or "Golden Years” -this
album might be a good starting
point. —

If, however, none of these I
» categories applies to you, spin, "

around twice, put your hands
over your eyes, and do yourbest
imitation of a dinosaur.

cake band, the Tigers, were
quite tame this evening, but hot
as a fever just the same. Nor-
man, of course, was the whole
show,’ always in motion like a
fiend, badgering his band and
having a great time. And, of

‘ course, Norman plugged Pitts-

burgh during the whole show,
though no conversions were
necéssary. But while the
audience was burning up, Nor-
man, unlike the Silencers‘, who
only improved on the big stage‘,
seemed dwarfed by it all, and
the intimate feeling of his bar
shows was missing. Even so,
there was mass hysteria by the
time Donnie Iris came out.

.. Pittsburgh does not have the

luxurvxof seeing Iris all that

ff..-

often, and tonight was clearly a
special event. Returning like. a
conquering hero, he took com-
mand of the proceedings with a
charming sense of awe. Iris and
his band, the Cruisers, have an
uncanny knack of recreating
their plush studio mood,‘ and
sounding spontaneous at the
same time. P
. Iris certainly doesn't look like
' a rock star, but he's got the voice
of one and commands his band
and audience to thrilling rock
and roll heights. His show
leaned heavily on material from
his new album, King Cool, but
generously ‘included ”The
Rapper” and ”Ah Leah.” After
all these years "The Rapper”
still punches you right between
the eyes. '

Looking amazed at the raven-
ous response he got, Iris
thanked the crowd the bestway
he knew how——by giving a great
show, and the audience's
response to it was quite

‘vehement-Iris was-the hero of
the night. .

..Somewhere in the midst of all '

this the new year was cele-
brated, and let's just hope the
“Stanley madea new year's reso-
‘ lution ‘to be a little more il_idul-
gent with local talent. This
concert proved that Pitts-

burghers wouldn't mind having 

the local boys headline the Stan-
ley a little more often.
