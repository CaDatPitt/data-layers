ed after tr)/buts Monday.

Scheduled to meet at least four major schools, the men
In the ﬁrst contest, against

pearances tonight and tomorrow night.

Pitt Players Open.
Two-Night Stand

“March Hares” Wins Acclaim Of IKS
Audience At Premiere Showing

Ring up the curtain!

Tonight and tomorrow night, in the YMHA auditorium,
Pitt Players will make their last appearance of the cur-
rent theatrical season before a campus audience.

The vehicle by which the Players will climax a. suc-
cessful season is the diverting 3-act comedy, “March
Hares,” by Harry Wagstaif Gribble, The initial perform-
ance was given Sunday night before a large audience in
the Irene Kaufmann Settlement auditorium.

The ﬁrst-nighters particularly liked the ranting of
Geoffrey, an aesthetic elocutionist, portrayed by Charles

'Foreman, C35, who thought that the world was conniv-

ing against him.

They also found considerable enjoyment in a rollicking
scene in which Geoffrey became involved, in a purely in-
nocent way, with two women; one, his ﬁancee, Janet
Rodney, partner in el.ocution; the other, a perfervid lit-
tle creature called Claudia Kitts, who found Geoffrey
“fascinating.” A Janet is played by Louise McKirdy, C36,
and Claudia, by Maxine Christensen, C35.

Passion and intrigue play a large part in the plot de-
velopment. Miss Kitts, not content with making a con-
quest of Geoffrey, sets her cap for the rather ordinary
Fuller, played by Joseph Wasel, CE36, who longs for
someone to love him.

The cook, played by Ola McGrail, C36, and the maid,
Margaret Lewis, C36, are likewise affected by this cu-
rious spell which Geoffrey casts over women. Mother
Janet, played by Ruth Shapiro, C37, catches the spirit
ofromance also, and becomes infatuated by the mascu-
line charms of the commonplace Fuller.

The phantom-like Oliver, manservant, supplies back-
ground and evokes laughs by his urbane dignity. The
role is played by Paul Stinner, Phys Ed35. Mr. Brown,
an obliging young man who enjoys seeing people tortur-
ed, is portrayed by Francis Devlin, C37.

SFA, News Heads

On Druidgommittee

Four Students, Dr. Lanfear To Select
Nominees For Sophomore Plaque

Two activity leaders, Leonard Marks, C35, SFA head,
and John Tibby, C35, editor of The News, along with
two Druids, Cortland Leigh, C37. and Edwin Beachler,
C37, were elected to the nominations committee for the
Druid plaque award, at the regular meeting in the Kappa
Sigma house Sunday.

These four students, along with Dr. Vincent VV. Lan-
fear, dean of men, will act as a committee of ﬁve to cut
down to 10 the nominations for the Druid plaque. The
award will honor the outstanding sophomore man in
the class of 1937. Dr. Lanfear will preside as chairman
of the group.

Preliminary nominations are being made by 34 activ-
ity leaders throughout the University. These men will
name their choices by Friday_ April 12. Selections may
be turned in to either Miss Mary Milburn, Room 801,
Cathedral, or IV. Gordon Rauck, procedure chairman of
the plan.

The first meeting of the nominating group of ﬁve will
probably be held Monday, according to Dr. Lanfea1'.

At the same meeting, it was decided to set Friday as
the deadline for all petitions for the spring tapping. At
this time, 12 second-semester freshmen will be inducted
into the Druid group to take the places of the 12 men
selected at the last spring tapping. "

The group will also try a new interview plan to help
in the coming spring selection. Tomorrow, all the can-
didates will be interviewed by the executive committee
headed by E. Ernest Rose, C37, and including Raymond
Scheib, C37, Cortland Leigh, C37, Stanley D. Rogaliner,
C37, and Edwin Beachler, C37, from one to 4:30 o’clock,
on the eighth ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

Co-op Will Award First
Eﬂiciency Prize At Banquet

A bronze trophy for management etﬁciency and co-
operation will be awarded to a fraternity by the Cooper-
ative Buying association at its banquet early in May, ac-
cording to Samuel Strauss, head of the Association.

The award will be based on three years’ participation
in the Co-op. Speciﬁc points to be considered by the
Judges in making the selection are: an improvement in
the ﬁnancial condition of the fraternity during the past
three years. the degree to which a fraternity has cooper-
ated with the association and the promptness of the fra-
ternity in meeting its obligations. Percentage of cooper-
ation rather than total buying volume will count in the
awarding of the trophy.

All members of the Cooperative Buying association are
eligible for the trophy.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men, is to be one of
the judges. Dr. Omar C. Held, personnel assistant to
the dean, and Robert D. Ayars, professor of accounting,
will probably be the other judges.

Annual CA Spring Formal
Closes Four-Dance Series

The College Association’s yearly series of four dances
comes to a.n end Friday night at the Hotel Schenley,
when the Spring Formal takes place from 9 to 1 o'clock.
Soon after, the cabinet will get together, count over its
ﬁnances, and determine just how much money it can pass
on to its loan fund for needy students.

Fran Eichler’s ten-piece orchestra, which is almost as
well known to the undergraduate body as “Hail to Pitt,”
has been booked for the four hours of dancing.

For the ﬁrst time in many semesters, a CA formal has
been billed into the Hotel Schenley——for the past three
years most of the Association dances took place on the
Northside.

Tickets for Friday night’s stiff-shirt, low-back event
are on sale for $2 per couple. Don Campbell, ’35, presi-
dent of CA, advised that “bargain rate” tickets this time
are non-existent—-—those who purchased semester passes
for $2 in February just aren’t selling any part of their
tickets.

Available in the oﬁice of-the dean of men, Room 801,
Cathedral, in the College oﬁice, Room 205 State hall,
tickets may also be purchased from the following mem-
bers of the cabinet:

Campbell, Frank Frederick, ’36, Arthur Stroyd, ’36,
Harvey Goldstein, ’37, Oscar Schlossberg, ’35, Drew
Steele, ’37, Beverly Brown, ’37, Edward Durkin, ’36,
Maxine Christensen, ’35, George Gehres, ’36, Eleanor
Humphries, ’36, Frank Reich, ’36, Ray Scheib, ’37, Ger-
trude Schein, ’36, and Charles Holstein, ’36.

 

Little Addresses Forum
On Overprotected Child

“The relation of maternal overprotection to school
acliievement” was discussed at the Psychology forum
Monday afternoon, A study of overprotected children
compiled by the Child Guidance center was presented to
the group by Dr. Harry M. Little, director of the center
and assistant professor of psychology and lecturer in
social work.

“The trend among overprotected youngsters,” Dr. Lit-
tle concluded from the study, “is toward acceleration in
reading ability and verbalization. and retardation in sub-
jects involving arithmetic. On the other hand. rejected
children often show reading disabilities and poor vocab-
ulary development.”

“One explanation for this trend, though perhaps some-
what oversimpliﬁed,” Dr. Little added, “holds that over-
development of reading ability is the result of close ,
association of the child with the mother and the adults
in the home, to the exclusion of childhood contacts in
play groups. In such a sheltered life, the child gains
verbalization concepts characteristic of adults and is de-
nied concepts of an arithmetical nature such as he might
gain from trips to the store and the like.”

Owl, To Appear Tap Day,
Dedicated To Dr. Bowman

Dedicated to Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor of the
University, the 1935 Owl will appear on the campus dur-
ing Spring Festival Tap Day, featuring the Hall of
Fame announcements, yearly selections of outstanding
senior activities leaders, according to Charles Foreman,
editor.

Between embossed leather covers of black and white.
275 pages will depict the University of 1935’. This rep-
resents an increase of 25 pages over last year. Twenty-
one pages will be devoted to campus snapshots, views,
intimate snaps of activities leaders, and fraternity house
pictures.

Herrymon l\iaurer_ literary editor of the Owl, will con-
tribute ﬁve pages of editorial material.

Approximately 700 copies of the Owl have been sold
by the circulation and advertising staffs of the Owl.
Jules Green, C35. business manager, has ordered 75
additional copies to sell at the regular undergraduate
subscription price of $3.50. Subscriptions may be pur-
chased at the Owl oﬁice, Room 801, Cathedral, for $2
down payment, the remaining $1.50 to be paid on de-
livery.

March F—ERA Ifeport

The University FERA ofﬁce reports that 669 students
worked on FERA projects during the month of March.
These students earned a total of $8,623.80, the allotted
amount for this University.

distributed a total of $54,397.80, of government money.
Eight hundred and thirty-six students have shared in

Deans Approve Plans
For Peace Assembly
On Friday Morning

Dr. Clausen Chosen To Address Meeting
In Heinz House; Students May Leave.
Glass In Time For 11 ()’Clock Talk

Select Student Board

. Dr. Bernard  Glausen, pastor of the First Bap-
tist church, will address the peace assembly in
Heinz House Friday morning, it was announced
late yesterday. .

The deans of the University S|.fl100l.S, meeting
together Monday morning voted their apprxobation
of a peace assembly open to those students who
wish to attend. "

The assembly will be held Fridav morning from
11 o’clock until noon. Students who leave their
classes to attend the assembly will not receive cuts.

The deans‘ voted to delegate to the Student-Faculty
Association responsibility for securing :1. proper meeting
place and for securing suitable speakers. They will rec-
ommend to their faculties that they say to their ciasses
at 10:55 o’clock:

“You are privileged to attend the peace assembly. If
you care to leave for that purpose, please do so at this
time.”

The Assenibly will last until 11:40. After the meet-
ing there will be a student forum for those wishing to
remain.

In the meeting of the deans it was felt irnulvisable,
since certain students and faculty members had express-
ed to them a wish not to disband classes for 9. peace
assembly, to dismiss all classes for the third hour.

Leonard Marks, chairman of the Executive committee,.

Monday appointed Herrymon Maurer, C36, Ruth Belle
Strothers, C37, Jules Green, C35, and Bill Edwards, C35,
to act with himself as a student arrangenlents group.

The deans, however, wished to give deﬁnite support to
those students who feel that an assembly should be held.
Faculty members, they decided, will continue their
classes and may themselves attend the 11 o’clock meet-
ing if members of their classes attend.

Modern World Seeking
New Philosophy For Living

Ma-urer Contends Materialism Has Warped Society; New
Social Force Needed To Alter Mental Attitudes

By Herrymon Maurer

Y THE MIDDLE of the 13th century writers were certain enough of the

nature of the new bourgeois order to attack or to praise certain ‘of its
manifestations. Samuel Richardson, himself beautifully equipped with a
petty morality, took it upon himself to praise its respecta.bi1ity, its property
interests. He reassured the good burghers that God in his heaven, would
look happily upon all those who treated their women as
commotlitles and who went. to church every Sunday.
In Cross’ “History of the English Novel". you may find
the following condensation of one of Richardsorrs’ moral
tales, "clipped of its -decorations.” It is typical.

“There were once two little boys and two little girls,
who never told fibs, who were never rude, noisy, mis-
chievous, nor quarrelsome; who always said their
prayers before going to bed and as soon as they arose.
They grew up. The masters became fine gentlemen;
and the misses became ﬁne ladies and housewives.
There were once three naughty boys who had a
naughty sister. They were always quarreling and
scratching, and would not say their prayers. They,
too, grew up. One of the boys was drowned at sea,
the second turned thief, and the third was forced to
beg his bread in a far country. And the naughty
little girl fell from a tree and broke her arm and died‘ of fever.”

 

Maurer

An Ausgpicious Beginning

Under such ideological auspices did our civilization begin. Those cou-
ceptious which appear when a civilization is still comparatively new have
,a way of becoming grotesquely gigantic when a. civilization can boast of
years. When Richardson wrote his novels be dealt with God and Business;
ﬁche one helped the other. Benjamin Franlrlin, a few years later, had very
little to say about God. His morality revolved about the central ideas of
thrift and industry. Still later, more realistic persons stopped worrying
about God altogether (though conceiving, as Swift says, "some scattered No-
tions about a Superior Power to be of singular Use to the Common People”)
and considered only business and those scientiﬁc precepts which would help
to bring in the bank notes.

Swift, who by criticizing the institutions of an age at its beginning
touches home against those same institutions today, comments savagely on
the ag‘e’s lack of any religious force. In his essay, "An Argiirncnt to Prove
tfnat the Abolishing of Cln'istia.nit.y in England may . . be attended with
some Inconveniences,” presenting the thesis that religion-~by such being
meant activities which affect action—-—be abolished and that Christianity—-
by such being meant something on the order of Huey Long's sugar teat--
be retained, he showed satirically that his age was prevented by the most
practical considerations from following any vita]: way of life.

“l hope no reader imagines me so weak as to stand up in the D‘efe-use
of Real Christianity, such as used in Primitive Times . . to have an in-
fluence upon Men’s Beliefs and Actions: To offer at the. restoring’ of That
would indeed be a wild Project; it would be to dig’ up Foun‘.d‘a.tions-, to de-
stroy at one Blow all the Wit, and half the Learning of the Kingdom;: to
break the entire frame and constitution of Things, to ruin Trade‘, ex-
tinguish Arts and Sciences with the Professors of them; in" short,. to“ turn
our Courts, Exchanges, and shops in-to Deserts.”

Swift lived only shortly before RiIch:.i.r(lson. He gmve expressio-'£x~ to con-
ceptions totally different from those which r.-l1aracte1'iz'e.d those held by the
new middle class. People generally realized-—just as S"-wift saw they would
rea.lize——that it was much easier for tl.'1ei.r own comfort and mu-cl’; better for
business to live according to Richardson: than acconling to Swi?f.‘t..

George Eliot, writing in the middle ljlltb century, complained’ that the
life of the people she knew was not t()u‘clJ:ted at all by any conscious wa * of
living. The T ullivers could achieve only a limited in:tere.s-t inn theisr family
welfare and in 8. respectability that stood‘. them in good stead at the market
place. .

No True-Way Of Living

’l‘0da._v we are still without a way of life; which can‘ give meaning; or‘ di-
rection to the lives of great, groiips of peop.l'e.. Our civil‘iza.t‘i‘on proclztiiiis as
its highest ideal the acquisition of money" or material: possessions. The
b0u1‘;;e0i.sie', who have the wherewithal to iirdhlge. their‘ ideal‘, engage in: com-
petitive buying of bath-tubs and automobilesgz for the fzilnil-"yr'w'itl1 the most
re.splend-’ent l)-Zl.l.'ll—lEUl)l= an-d the sleekest liinousiiie is supreme over all-. The
workers, how scarcely need to be told lllftt‘ they cannot atternpt. out-buying‘

tells that they can find} happiness and nobility by sw~e'at.iu‘g day after  to-
support. a. few plntocmzts in luxury.

In other ages different religions have triod'fum'bl‘1'”ngl‘y and lblifud-‘ly per-
haps, to pres-‘eut some concepts to guide pers'o11sain-their re.'u.*.tions- to other
persons. No age‘ other than ours has cast the pr-.3l‘)l'exn aside. Qur religions-

‘for virtue and r.ig.lil.eousn.e-s:s, they may have the good’ things in life. Attem-

Ma.teria.1 Religion

Small wonder it is that material consiclerations have become so important
today. Religion, at the time of the reform:2hti‘esn became openly an excuse for
getting money; sometime before that it ceased to be a. way of life.

Phi'lo.s0pl1y began to discuss the Inachiue, the principles of tit-e revolu-
tion planets, of the evolution of animals, this principles-.absti'a.ctly considered
in the light of scientiﬁc materialism-——of‘ animal nature. ‘When it condes-
cended to speak of man, it associated him with the vulgar concepts of so
cheap it bourgeois as Herbert Spencer, who beo.uti'fully reconciled his so-
ciology with the supreme interests of business. ‘Nith the cries. of “Progress

. order . . survival of the fittest” the Dhilosopliers and scientists ele-
vated those ideas in the minds of a group of grasping entrepreneurs into a
science.

The whole tradition has been so indoctrinated in us, we have so been
led to think of it as an eternal absolute that it has stuck to us entirely too
long. Things have come to such a pass today that an expression of any de-
cent idea or sentiment if made in public is condemned in the newspapers, or
righteously slandered if made in private. 80 strong is this tradition that
the blueprints of the reformers and the ra.dica.ls, so-called, deal mostly with
bathtubs. Success is to be reckoned in terms of the number of bathtubs “pro-
duced. Vslheu all have bathtubs, people will be decent and good.

Warped Characters

But the matter is not so simple. Materialism with its by-product ex-
ploitation has warped us; it will warp those who try it in the future. Inter-
ests which characterize a civilization in its infancy have 3. way of becoming
all—important in its maturity and completely oppressive in its old age. Today
we seek a. way of life, not 3. way of getting money. \Ve need the socialiand
regenerative force of ways of living which, like primitive Christianity, can
completely alter the world by altering the minds of the people who live in it.

Education A Vital Force
In Democracy’s Strength

By Alan C. Lloyd

UDGED BY the standards of Education. there are four
kinds of government. There are the ignorant leading
the ignorant. This is tyranny. There are the ignorant
leading the wise. This is a. prelude to revolution. '1‘l1ero
are the wise leading the ignorant. This is dictatorship.
possibly a. benevolent autocracy. There are the wise
leading the wise, giving liberty, equality, and fraternity.

This is the ideal of democracy.

Deﬁnitions

At the present time, the wise, or semi-wise are lead-

ing the people, and unless the people wise up to them.
thus creating democracy, we will have
a. dictatorship. And this dictatorship,
as wisdom loses ground, may degen-
erate into tyranny. The problem con-
fronting education at this time is that
of “wising up” the ignorant populace;
not a. process of disparagement, but of
interpretation.

There is much to be learned by the
people. They all know that our fore-
fathers set up a government of laws,
not of‘ men, 3. government of balances
and checks. Perhaps they do not
-need. to be told that we now have a.
government of men, not of laws. Per-
haps they realize that balances have
been swept away and the scales are

‘ measured by a lone, partial eye. \Ve
have a new deal, and the dealer holds the pack of cards.
And each time he deals one, he lessens the pack in his
hand; yet deal he must.

The Romans Had A Way

If the ignorant public does realize this, they must only
be taught how to place the limitations on the dictator-
ship. Of these the Roman system is simplest: merely
place at. time limit on office. The Roman dictator, you
may 1-em.-milier, was elected for a period of six months.
Yer. the diﬁiculties of limiting the New Deal to :1 deﬁnite
number of months is obvious.

The right of selection and removal is 9. second guard
against tyranny. hi the public school systems, admin-
istrative oﬂ'i<':ers are appointecl, and can be removed.
Most universities, like ours, however, have a govern-
ment of men, not laws. Only by changing the men can
cliange of opinion become’ expressed, VV'e elect our
president: we: elect our delegates to treat with him.
Our delegates have given him unheard-of powers. It is
possible to replace them a.lI—-—but‘no-t soon enough to
be effective  a method" of checking dictatorslxips.

Another limitation is through the direct observance of
the powers (tonlerred by writteti law. Unfortunately for
this phase, Amerimm laws live not on face values, but
on interpretation and SlIg,‘._’,’€Sl.l0l1 and implication; so the
only possible limitation of dictato1“sl1ip' is education.
Only through knowledge of politics and 'goveru-ment can
a. democracy, with its a.tte-nd:-mt liberties, be maintained.

Original Purpose 01' American Schools .
Tlie origrinz-11 purpose of American education was to

 

Alan C. Lloyd

. perpetuate the idea-ls: of liberty through eul'i'gbte,ument, ‘

through p1'eD2l1'ati011' for pa.rticipat.i'on. For if left with-
out El. draft, the ilanie of liberty flickers and burns low.
It. was the J:iC(>l)ll1 cl'ul')‘s of Fra-.nce- and others of the
same- ilk that carried‘ one of the mos. effective adult-
cducati'o-zt plans into completion that the .wo~rld had
known’. lt, was the early American press where wrote
.l'eff'erson, Paine. ‘Webster; ]?Iami'l‘tovr:, and llladison, that
started’. and upheld the first surge of liberty in this coun-
try; but it was the American school, tlial: opened‘ with
the Star-Spangled Banner or the American. Creed’ that has

' ma;i'ntai’ued* the spirit of’ patriotism.

Realizing, then, the obl'igat.ion of’ education, the pres-
out crisis‘ in education is truly" a-l’a'rm-lug. The numerous
*tev.cl:e-r-salary cuts, the i‘ncrease in class sizes, the in-
crease‘ of the teachers’ burdens‘, tlle: IH"8'V€IItl0-XI‘ of curri-
culum em-'.i'chment, the cl‘osi"n'«g; of" schools. the e1i'mina--
tiou of post-graduate courses have brought about a.
i-':rgi*z121t youth, unemployed‘, unwanted, polit.ica_Ily and so-
<-ia.ll',v ignorant. Closing, and cutting down, of ecl'uca~
ti'm1‘al’ fa;c1’l'ft1"es is not only 3. barrier to the sirccess of
the New Deal, but also a type‘ of‘ social suicide for the

. naﬁorr.

At. a time vrlien the curricu'l'a; of‘ both elementary and
secondary schools are wa.rpi'm>;. changing, add’1”n=g', grow-
ing: and l)e(:01i1ix1g‘ practical’-mi'n‘d"ed", the opportirnirty for
pub-lie service of teacher co.l‘l'eges is great. Alnrost the
entire staff’ of the '.l'ea.cliers C‘ol’.l’eg:e- of C'o~ltm1lri'a i1neiver-
sity has cliirectly given help to state e-cmcatioiiatl org.;.a1i-
izations.
A professor  sent here to a.-id -state board‘s;- a-uotlier
there to n1al‘:e‘- efficiency suggestions: another comes with

, plans for more economic elemen-tzr.r_v‘ school education.

The school is, and has been‘, an 1‘uﬁuent1’a:I force in
moulding the public curricula- They have had frequent
gifts from societies and priv:1.te.- phﬂantbropists to enable
them to carry on this work-

(overburdened Stall

Here at the University, profess~ors and fnstructcrrs have
been overburtlened with classes since September to the
extent that their public tiscfrclness is almost nil, and
they are d'eﬁni’tely prevented‘ from (lire-ct ptrblic aid, if
the state 1”nvestfgation- proves true-.

If the state appropriation is withheld, the lesser in-
structors-, who do so much toward lightening the load of
the tops, will be released, and greater burdens will be
forced upon those rem-zrining-~. Wllen that occurs, the
school will become 3. negli,g1‘bl’e- social agent.

On To Leadership

‘What is needed is a l‘ar:.:er- appropriation than ever be-
f'o-re, one which will en.a.bl‘e- our a.utl1o1-'ities in the school
to divide their work between enlightening the stuclent
body and guiding public affairs. If the issues of the
Nesv ‘Deal would be ra-is-erl by prot‘essors with possible
a-nszwers, and lines of’ theory explaiiietlt if students could
get—as they 11eed—unb1‘a.sed exam.ina.tions of the poli-
tical‘ instittttions of our foreign neighbors; if the local
commercial and economic issues were properly, publicly
analyzed: if education would be more than a matter of
polishing, then, and not until then. would the public be-
come educated into democracy. Our University staff
should be composed of leaders; leaders are essential to
public welfare. Leaders to train leaders! And at Pitt!

Take It Gently
We'll have the facts, forsoothe!
Hal investigate their classes!
The truth, sir, nothing but the truth;
What color are your glasses?

Letters To The Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

The investigation of the University of PllLl’.Sl)lll‘_l2'll is a
direct challenge to the ideals of every student. The ﬁrst
two days of investigation unfolded the sinister and un-
founded insinuations of the demagogues of education.
Their testimony revealed how far a. radical will go to
damn an American institution.

Those gentlemen of ability and intelligence, who have
made it possible for the University of Pittsburgh to at-
tain its prominence and stability in the realm of educa-

tion, have been insulted by pseudo-radicals whose only
thought is personal aggrandizement and egotistical glory.

The idea of suppression of free speech and free as-
sembly at the University of Pittsburgh is laughable.
There exists in our school that degree of freedom of
speech and assembly that would not be permitted in
other institutions oi.’ learning. Students, the honor and
integrity of our University have been challenged. Let us
unite to defend our school against the insidious lies of
the demagogues.

Basketball’s ﬁrst “Rose Bowl” classic, sponsored by the At-

Intercollegiate title, shared one-half
of the city championship with Du-
-quesne, and chalked up 19 wins in a
'24-game schedule against the best
-"teams in the country.

On the other hand, Louisiana
:State’s iive also makes claims to a ti-
‘tle, having won the Southern Inter-
collegiate conference ﬁrst place hon-
-01's with 12 victories in as many con-
ference games. During the season,
LSU scored an amazing high average
of 48 points a game, scoring more
"than 60 points on three occasions.

Newspaper reports from the South
-sing the praises of Coach Rabenhorst,
“"Sparky” Vvade. and the Tiger team,
‘placing the LSU boys on a par with
any team in the land. ‘Wade is the
captain of the State team and is claim-
ed to be one of the greatest basket-
ball players ever to come out of the
South. Scaling only ﬁve feet, seven
inches, \Vade mixes speed and ac-
curate shooting to lead his team to
victories.

Tigers Are Rather Small

The average height of the Louisiana
‘State boys is only ﬁve feet. 11 inches,
:giving the Panthers a decided advan-
tage with their average ot‘ six feet,
one inch. An interesting feature of
the game will be, from advance re-
ports, Louisiana Sta.te’s showmanship
-during the game. Southern teams
plan their attack and defense with an
eye to pleasing spectators as well as
developing a winning team, with the
result that ahnc-st all southern teams
are colorful in action. Captain Vvade
besides being a great ball player is a
genuine showman and sometimes
answers to the name “Clown of the
Court.”

Teaming with W'ade at the forwards
‘ls Buddy Blair. at the center position
is “Shongaloo” Lindsey, one inch over
six feet, and at the guards are Tex
Journey and Bucky Harris. combining
to give LSU a fast, sensational, ac-
curate-sliooting ﬁve which is out to
ﬁght the Civil War all over again
when they meet their northern rivals.

The Panther golf team defeated
Western Reserve’s crack quartet over
the Sleepy Hollow course a.t Cleve-
land in the ﬁrst match on the Pitt
spring schedule.

In their initial test the Panther
team defeated a team composed of
seasoned veterans and thereby sound-
ed a warning to their future oppon-
‘ents_

The bright spot of the first victory
was the ﬁne play of Padden Gamble,
a sophomore, who will likely be one
of the In-iainstays of the 1935 team. In
his first intercollegiate match Padden
saved the day for Pitt by sinking a
birdie three on the last hole to give
the Panthers a tie in match play.

Net Season Will
Open Tomorrow

At Wash ington.

Pitt's tennis team s-wings into action
tomorrow afternoon in ‘Washington, D.
C. against. George Washington univer-
sity’s outﬁt in its -first encounter of
the season. The netters left this
morning for the Capital city.

Coach Dave O’Loughlin, Panther
tennis coach, will probably rely on
virtually the same team that swept
through a. 12-game schedule last sea-
son with the loss of one match. In
place of Nate Ganger, last year’s No.
1 player, Coach O’Loughlin_has a ca-
pable replacement in Bob Madden,
star of last year’s frosh team.

Joe Madden and Jimmy Slocum.
veteran lettermen, will likely be found
at No. 2 and No. 3 posts in tomorrow’s
lineup. For the remaining positions
on the squad. it will be a. battle among
three veterans and two newcomers.
The letterman angling for places are
Roy Heckler and Jimmy and Lloyd

Thompson. Willie Norton and George
Golanty are the other prospective
competitors.

Following the George Vvashington

niatcll, the netters will travel to An-
napolis for a struggle with the Mid-
dies. The Navy lads were responsible
for the one blot on Pittfs record last
year. After the Navy, O’Loughlin and
crew will journey back to 'Washington
for the Georgetown match.

 

Riflemen Get Fifth Place
In Intercollegiate Match

There was some tall shootin’ in the
Eastern Intercollegiate Riﬂe tourna-
ment. at Annapolis Saturday when the
Navy and the Cornell teams both broke
the previous match record of 1382.

«Navy took first place with the high '
score of 1391 while Cornell took sec-
ond place with a 1385 total.

Pitted against 12 of the East's out-
standing contenders, Pitt ﬁnished up
in the ﬁrst division by placing ﬁfth.
The Panthers, with a" score of 1340,
followed Carnegie '.l‘ech’s 1344 point
l:ot.al. Lehigh ﬁnished tllird with 1355
points. -

The Pitt News

Coach Carl Olson's varsity and
freshman track performers will wind
up heavy practice routines in antici-
pation of the ﬁrst big outdoor show of
the season, the annual University
Handicaps, scheduled to hold the in-
terest of district track fans on Satur-
day afternoon at the stadium.
Freshman athletes will probably
have their only chance of the season
to compete with the varsity and in-
dications point to some i-nteresting
['rosh—varsity duels. Art Thomas,
freshman dash star, will start from
scratch in the 220-yard dash with
Arvel Fleming. Bennett, in the high
jump, has been given a scratch rating.
In the 100-yard sprint, Mason, Baran
and Thomas form a trio of threats for
the varsity performers.

Captain Fred Kiger will find his
hands full in the quarter-mile event.
Starting from scratch with Kiger will
be Hal Connelly and such luminaries
as Great. Mcldunn, and McDonald have
been given slight handicaps indicat-

and Great start from scratch with
Kiger, McConnell, and Theriault in
good positions to give the two favor-
ites plenty of opposition.

Pelucha with a scratch rating will
‘ﬁnd Will Johnson, Gerrety and Blair
with favorable handicap assignments.
In the discus, Fassinger looms as the
favorite with Bonavita, Gongloff,
Avizienis, and Hanley boasting nice
handicaps.

Taano will have no advantage on
the ﬁeld in the javelin throw starting
out from scratch. Gongloff with a 5-
foot handicap and Bonavita. with 20

If student enthusiasm can be taken
for an accurate criterion, a very large
and most. enthusiastic group of Intra-
mural boxers and wrestlers will be on
hand when the third annual tourna-
ment gets under way the week of
May 6.

The tournament sites have been
clloscn by Coaches Schricker and
Oster, who are sponsoring the affair,
and the method of conducting ‘the
bouts has been decided. In both the
boxing and wrestling matches, trial
eliminations will begin May 6, at
Trees gymnasium and continue
through the week up to the ﬁnals,
which have been set for the evening
of May 10, at the stadium pavilion.
Admission for the bouts will be either
by student athletic book or 25 cents.
For the boxers, there will be the
regulation three two-minute round
bouts, with the decision being given
by the referee. Vi/restlers will also
compete. under existing collegiate
rules being decided by one fall or de-

cision.

Entry blanks for the tournament
will be accepted at Trees gymnasium,
together with the 10 cent entry fee
being charged for the events.

Eligibility rules will follow those
set for other Intramural sport events.
Any registered student, with passing
grades in twelve or more credits is

who have competed in any meets are

from 3 to 5 o'clock. for both boxers
and wrestlers, with coaches Schricker
and Oster in attendance. Fundamen-
tals and conditioning are being
stressed at these practice sessions,
and the increasing number of turn-
outs has boosted the prediction of a
large entry list in each of the eight
classes.

Although the officials have not been
chosen, as yet, plans are being made
to have the bouts handled by well
known local boxing and wrestling
ﬁgures.

At Balloting Boxes Today

 

9 Major Groups
Will Elect New
Campus Leaders

Senior Court Supervises Voting;
Informs Winning Candidates;
Seniors Choose Queen

 

By Ruth Belle Strothers

“Thou shalt remember the day of
election to keep it holy . . .” reads
in part the fourth commandment given
by Miss Theresa Kahii, debating
coach, for the women’s general elec-
tions today.

And with this thought in mind, un-
dergraduate women on campus will
troup to the Heinz House voting polls
today between 9:30 and 3:30 o'clock to
select next year’s leaders for the ni-ne
major women’s organizations on cam-
pus.

Organizations in which oﬂicers for
1935-36 will be selected include VVSGA,
WAA, ‘YWCA, Panhellenic, Glee club,
Debating, and the classes of ’36, ’37,
and ’38.

In observing the regulation voting
procedure, each woman will have her
name checked off the voting list of
that organization before she receives
a ballot, and when the ballot has been
marked, it must be placed in the speci-
ﬁed ballot box.

When the polls close at 3:30 o’clock,
Senior Court will convene in Heinz
House to open ballot boxes and to
count the votes.

Successful candidates will be noti-
ﬁed of their election by phone on Wed-
nesday evening if they live in the city.
Official results of all elections will be
published in the Friday issue of The
Pitt News.

At the same time that undergradu-
ate women are selecting their leaders
for the coming year, senior women
will be selecting their Senior Queen,
the highest honor that can be attained
by a graduating woman.

The Senior Queen is chosen, not for
her beauty alone, but for her charac-
ter, her personality, her academic
achievements, her social qualities, and
her contribution as a leader to the life
of the University of Pittsburgh, ac-
cording to the ritual by which the
Senior Queen is crowned.

‘The results of the election of Senior
Queen and Alma Mater, made by
preferential ballot, is not revealed un-
til Activities Tap Day on May 3, dur-
ing Spring Festival week.

Names of all candidates are printed
011 Page 1, and a list of voting quali-
ﬁcations for each organization can be
found at the right.
