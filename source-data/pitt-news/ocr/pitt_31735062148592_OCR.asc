ma Delta; most sociable, Pi Lambda
Phi; best dressed, Delta Tau Delta;
and the best decorated house, Phi
Delta Theta, whic.h used Tuxedo

Perring [Wakes “Spring Bet’

Humor Magazine Appears on Campus Today

By Lew Riley

If you found Panther editor
Mary Lou Perring and business
manager Jack Hoeveler out on the
Cathedral lawn» this morning gap-
ing at the skies, you may be as-
sured that they were looking for
spring and very much in
earnest.

Miss Perring and Hoeveler devel-
open their sudden interest in the
weather only last Monday after a
Panther delegation journeyed to
the Pittsburgh ofﬁces of the United
States Weather Bureau, where Miss
Perring o.ffe.red to bet bureau chief
W.‘ S. Brotzman that today would
find spring in Pittsburgh, despite
all wintry weather predictions to
the contrary.

The wager, by the way, was
prompted by the appearance this
morning of the “spring issue” of the
Panther, campus humor publica-
tion. The Panther staff declared
its conﬁdence Monday that only
blue skies and balmy breezes could
greet their spring issue, and they
were ready to l.et their editor and
business manager prove‘ it.

The stakes: Miss Perring and
Hoeveler pro-mised Mr. Brotzman
that they would roller-skate around
the Cathedral walks tomorrow in
“spring togs” in case this year’s be-
lated spring failed to show up on

Maybe

A new and larger lunch room will
“probably” be built in the near fu-
ture, Mr. Weber declared, but no
definite place was revealed “until
plans have been studied carefully.”

He said that the anticipated lar-
ger eating place will be located on
the same floor as the kitchenette.

No deﬁnite menu was released
but Mr. Weber pointed out that it

Friends Talk
To McCor1nick

The University students who last
week testified at the trial of former
University senior John McCormick
said this week that there was “no
noticeable change in his demeanor”
when they talked to him for twenty
minutes during a courtroom recess
a week ago Monday.

Bob Miller, C40, and Bob Ben-
jamin, C40, said they didn’t talk
about anything important with Mc-
Cormick, who last Saturday was
sentenced to life imprisonment after
a jury found him “guilty, with a
recommendation of mercy.”

Miller and Benjamin appeared at
the trial on Monday, March 11, as
character witnesses for the defense.

“When we had our short talk
with John last week our conversa-
tion wasn’t too coherent or impor-
tant. We gabbed about Cleveland
night spots and that’s about all,”
Miller said.

Registrar John G. Quick made an
appearance on the same day at the
trial, testifying as to the grades
McCormick made when he attended
the University.

Next issue of the News will ap-
pear a week. from today, Wednes-
day, March 27, announces Robert
C. Adams, C40, editor.

less of the temperature. When ﬁrst
asked to come in on the bet, Mr.
Brotzman remarked with a broad
smile, “Sure, just as long as it’s a
stunt.”

According to the Panther board
of strategy, a panel of three well-
known Pittsburghers will decide
late today whether spring actually
was in the air today, and which
party to the wager would have to
carry out his promise tomorrow.

F PC President
Lists N 0 Action
011 ‘Purge Bill’

Helen Wilson, C40, president of
the Fraternity Presidents’ Council,
announced Monday that there will
be no further action taken this year
to enforce the sensational “no poli-
tics” plan for women’s fraternities.

“We will be glad to open discus-
sion of the situation if the matter
is ever brought before the council
again,” Miss Wilson stated, “but as
we have accomplished our purpose
in bringing the resolution before
the various houses, we do not feel
that any discussion of the matter is
necessary.”

Instead of the heated argument
which was expected to continue
over the “purge bill” for women’s
politics on campus at Monday’s
meeting, the council peacefully dis-
cussed plans for a “dessert round-
table” to be held on April 15 as an
introduction of the new fraternity
presidents to the activities of the
council.

Nationalism is an ugly word; it is also a glitter-
ing generality. In history books it is easily recog-
nized. But as contemporary red scares, alien re-
strictions, religious and race prejudice, trade bar-
riers, or ﬂag-waving super-patriotism nationalism
is not generally called by its true name.

The United States is in the throes of super-
nationalism. The thoughts that were held by men
of good will about breaking down the barriers be-
tween nations and peoples have been snowed under
by a wave fear and hatred for all that is different
or strange.

Yet, there are still a few who remember that
all men are brothers. Here at the University the
Y is bringing Dr. T. Z. Koo to speak to students
and faculty tonight; Dr. Koo is one of those who
remembers t’hat in order for us “to make our com-

. bi11ed*lom"el‘eJt*‘ofipeace ‘and happiness for all, we

must each break our own shell.”

The Y, itself, is not bringing the speaker here
just to be preached to. They have arranged the

services, that there might be a proﬁt Which can

would seem almost compulsory that the students
and the faculty escape for an evening from narrow
provincialism and narrow nationalism, by breaking
their own shells and going to hear Dr. Koo tonight.

New \Ve Face
A Traffic Prebleln

One of the hardiest of our perennial campus
problems popped up again yesterday, with the de-
cision of Pittsburgh police to enforce strictly the
two-hour parking limit on Fifth Avenue and
Lytton Avenue.

According to the city department of trafﬁc
planning, this action was forced on police by the
complaints of Oakland residents. A survey of the
streets surrounding the Cathedral will indicate the
extent of the parking problem faced by University
students.

A This latest action by the Pittsburgh police will
make much Worse the already-serious I parking
problem of students. SFA and the University ad-
ministration would do well to confer with city
officials to reach some remedy to this parking
problem.

:and director of Pitt Players, ap-
peared in last month’s issue of the
«Quarterly Journal of Speech, official
‘publication of the National Associa-
tion of Teachers of Speech.

The article presents’ the problems
facing the college director of this
type of show, the larger number of
actors with which he has to deal,
the assembling of material from his-
tory or other data, and the present-
ing of this dull material. in interest-
ing fashion.

In describing what he calls the
most convenient method of handling
these ‘problems, Mr. Whitehill uses
as an example a college pageant he
produced while director of the the-
atre at Marshall college, Hunting-
ton, W. Va. .

Fraternity M ushball Nines Pry Oﬂ
Lid on Spring Intramural Campaign

By Alex Zelenski
Fraternity mushball, highlight
of last year’s program, will offi-
-cially open the spring intramural
rsports program on Tuesday,
March 26. Director James Potts
‘will contact the 13 competitive
fraternities on the arrangement of
their first day’s schedules.
Sammies Favored

Sigma Alpha Mu, led by Pitcher
Lou Mendlow, will again be the
top choice for the crown, for im-
portant cogs in their championship
wheel are returning. Artie Hur-
witz, Hal Wintner, and Harry Nem-
rod will be the returning veterans.

Phi Delta Theta, last year’s run-
ner-up, should again have a suc-
cessful team with Johnny Dickin-
son and Dick Fullerton returning.
‘These. boys, . through their hitting
ability, kept the Phi Delts in the
race.

The third place Phi Eps, minus
the services of Marshall “Biggie”
Goldberg, will still have several
regulars returning and should be in
the thick of the race. The outstand-
ing players returning are Wally
Hirsch, Jay Silverberg, and A1
Kippen.

Gamma Gamma Woo, boasting
such players as Babe Stark, Joe
Aaron, and . Charles Sapper, is
again the favorite in the independ-
ent league, largely on the custom-
ary rating given defending champs.

Newman Club, outstanding in
every sport, will also rate consid-
eration with a team made up of
football and basketball players. Joe
Connell, Sam Milanovitch, Char-
ley Ptacek, and Mel Port are on
the Newman Club roster.

Amity Club, Sweepers. Debaters,
and Aces are other teams that will
ﬁgure in the championship races.
l\Ietallu_.vgists Strong

Last year’s champs, the Oil and
Gas team, will be favored as Saun-
ders, Spence, Sekela, Baker, and
Bielek are back.

Metallurgists, runner-up of last
year’s campaign, and -the Chemical
Engineers will bear watching. In-
dustrials, Civil Engineers, Mines,
and Electrical Engineers will round
out the league.

Golf again will be staged on the
Schenley links and will not start
on March 26, but at a later date.

Mile Relay Quartet Will Attempt

To Avenge Indianapolis Defeat

A vengeful Pitt relay squad gets
:21 return match with the University
of Michigan mile quartet when sev-
eral of the Panther trackers travel
to Ann Arbor for the invitational
Michigan AAU meet this week-end.

With the return of Frank Ohl to
‘the Pitt foursome, one of the great-
est indoor races of the year saw the
Panthers beaten by inches in the
Butler relays last Saturday by the
Michigan quartet. Phil Breiden-
bach, one of the nation’s top notch
quarter milers, broke the tape
ahead of Larry Tregoning by the
thickness of his Green and white
jersey.

Ohl had performed his famous
leadoff stunt of outdistancing the
pack by ten yards; the Indiana and
‘Michigan squads moved closer on
the next two legs. Breidenbach and
Roy Cochrane, famed world indoor
440 record holder, set out alter Tre-
goning. The conditioning the'Wo1-
verine star has had since Septem-
ber made the difference as he edged
‘Tregoning, although Larry staved
off the brilliant Cochrane.

In addition to the mile relay
squad, which will probably include

Polar League

Playoffs Open

The ﬁrst two games of the fresh-
man basketball Polar league elim-
ination series will be played today
as the Defrosters tackle the Pen-
guins at 3:30 o’clock and the Cold-
spots take on the Snowﬂakes at
4:30.

Captain Tay Malarkey should
make things hot for the Penguins
in the first game, with the team of
Anania and Williams assisting, if
Anania can leave football practice
long enough to play. The Penguins
will place their hopes on their
‘high-scoring forward, Bill Lewis,
and captain Frazier.

If footballer Bob Malloy can play
for the Coldspots, the team of
Spartz, Allcorn, and Malloy may
be too much for the Snowflakes.
Artman and Swacus will carry the
load for the Flakes.

Sweepers Score Upset
‘Over Hi-Rock Bowlers

In the quarter-ﬁnal round of the
open intramural bowling tourna-
ment. the underdog Sweeper team
handed the ‘Hi-Rocks their first de-
feat Monday, 2-1.

George Lanz with a one—game
‘high of 200 led the scorers. Harry
Leonard bowled his usual good
game and Dick Trimble and D.
Bodycombe rounded out the team.

This victory put the Sweepers
into a semi—ﬁnal match with the In-
dustrials today at 4:30. The win-
ner of this game will battle the Hi-
Rocks for the open bowling cham-
pionship at a later date.

(ENlER- NEVILLE

Center at Neville

Ohl, Tregoning, Bud Graf and
either Hap Stickel, Al Ferrara, or
Al McKee, the flashing sophomores,
Bill Carter and Stickel will seek a
repeat one—two ﬁnish in the 60-yard
dash,

Last Saturday night at Indian-
apolis the two winged yearlings
staged a whirlwind sprint, and had
the ofﬁcials in a quandry when it
came to choosing the winner. Stick-
el and Carter clearly showed their
superiority over their Western Con-
ference rivals, but a photo was
necessary to determine their own
order of finish. It was apparently
Carter’s turn to win, as he was giv-
en the gold medal.

Other Panther track stars to put
points in the Panther third place
total of 19% were Johnny Bazyk and
Dusty Rhoades. After ﬁnishing

second in his sophomore and junior-

years behind the dusky Michigan
powerhouse, Bill Watson,
pushed the iron 49 feet 8 inches to
grab ﬁrst place. Rhoades, the best
pole vaulter to compete for Pitt
since the days of Vic Pickard, Uni-
versity record holder, tied for sec-
ond place with a leap of 13 feet 4
inches.

 

Bazyk ,

nedy, Jones, and Kramer will de-
fend their championship.

The Newmans and the Oil and
Gas team will also be out to de-
fend the golfing crowns in their
respective leagues.

Horseshoes will be played in only
two leagues, the fraternity and the
engineering. Metallurgists and the
Delt duet will defend their laurels.

Tennis races will be close in all
leagues, for challenging teams will
have improved lineups. Newmans,
Metallurgists, and Delta Tua Delta
proved their superiority last year
by virtually walking away with the
championships.

Outfield Holds
First, Wo1°l{out

Mild weather Monday gave base-
ball coach. Ralph Mitterling his ﬁrst
opportunity to send his outﬁeld can-
didates outdoors to workout.

The practice, however, was some-
what curtailed due to the soggi-
nessof the Stadium turf caused by
a heavy snow earlier Monday aft-
ernoon.

The Panthers mentor, a la Frank
Frisch, drilled his inﬁeld and out-
field prospects for a. considerable
length of time in the newly con-
structed sliding pit.

Sophomore Bill Ritenbaugh and
senior Frank Goodell are the most
dangerous threats to Gabby Hart-
man and Guy Guadagnino in the
catching department.

Contrary to reports persistent at
the start of the spring practice ses-
sions. Ben Kish will not pitch for
the Panthers. Coach Mitterling re-
vealed Monday that, to date, Kish
has failed to put in an appearance.

of hard fought swimming scraps
when the University holds its an-
