Committees

At Meeting

Assembly Creates

New Division,

Statistics Survey

The main business of the ﬁrst
nieetiiig of the newly-elected Stu-
dent Faculty Association assem-
bly was the reorgaiiizatioii of sev-
eral of the committees of the
body, including the abolition of
three former committees and the
creation of the new Statistics Sur-
vey committee.

The new committee, suggested by
Patrick Cusick, E40, president of the
assembly, is designed to conduct sur-
veys of University student opinion
on conditions at the University. Cu-
sick stated that the assembly could
act more intelligently if it knew the
opinion of the students on important
matters. '

The three committees abolished by
the assembly on the recommendation
of former president John Downie,
BA39, were high school relations,
leadership training, and forum. Dow-
nie explained his recommendation
was based on reports submitted by
the chairmen of these committees.

The assembly discussed plans for
the year’s work, and decided that
meetings will be held at intervals
of three weeks during the coming
year, and that absence from two
meetings without sufficient reason
will , be cause for dismissal from the
group. . __

Downie, who opened the ‘meeting,
commented on the work of the SFA
assembly. “What the assembly can
do, I ‘feel is very limited. It can
out
.worthwhile projects, and cooperate
Its work is done
mainly through executive and stand-
i__ng committees.”

‘ Mary Letsche, C40, stated that the

g*f.undamental problem is the lack of

money for all activities. “The rea-

. son why SFA can’t do things is that
.it doesn’t have money.” Nancy Dig-
.4 by, C40, suggested that the heads of

other campus organizations meet.
with SFA in order to understand
its probems.

The suggestion of David Mackey,
E40, alternate member of the as-
sembly, to provide half-hour relig-
ious periods in Heinz Chapel on
Wednesdays and Fridays for students
was adopted upon the motion of
Jack Hoeveler, C40.

 1-OFFICIAL STUDENT TRI-WEEKLY

Legislature to Cut
University Grant
For Coming Year

The smallest University appro-
priation in ten years is slated for
probable passage through the
state House of Representatives
within the next few days.

Slashed by $88,000 this year, the
grant of $1,100,000 as approved
this week by the House Committee
on Appropriations is the lowest ﬁg-
ure since the 1927-29 biennium
grant. For the last two years, the
University has had a grant of $1,-
188,000.

Although a bill introduced by
Representative Lawrence P. Kee-
nan, Pittsburgh Democrat, proposed
to increase theappropriation to
$1,320,000, the approved grant is
$220,000 short of that figure.

Although $85,000 was cut from
the $1,485,000 appropriation for the
University of Pennsylvania, eight
other Pennsylvania institutions, in-
cluding Penn State college, were
granted increases in the House re-
port.

Penn State’s grant was raised
$50,000 from the budget proposal
to $4,475,000. An extensive build-
ing program on the Penn State
campus is responsible for the raise.

Temple university’s $900,000 ap-
propriation, although cut to $750,-
000 in Gov. Arthur H. James bud-
get, was restored in full by the
committee.

Penn Military college at Chester,
never before subsidized by the
state, was listed for a $150,000
grant by the committee.

Graduate Student Assistant Wins 1
rHonors in Field of Dog Breeding

By Jack Brady

As the last days of school draw
closer andcloser and students begin
worrying about examinations, term
papers, and degrees, a wandering re-
porter found that tests and degrees
are given to others besides college
students.

“Man’s best frie‘nd—-his dog” can
also earn degrees, according to
Charles M. Hepner, graduate student
assistant in biology, and one of Pitts-
burgh’s leading dog fanciers.

Corresponding to the bachelor,
master. and doctor degrees awarded
to students are the CD, companion
dog, CDX, companion dog excellent
and UD, utility dog degrees, which
are given to those dogs performing
before judges at ﬁeld trials through-
out the country. reveals Hepner,

of the German slieoherd breed. Reg-

Hepner hopes to reduce the vicious
temperament prevalent in the breed.
He says, “Only 20 per cent of tem-
perament is inherited and the other
80 per cent is due to upbringing.”

At the present time he is raising a
litter of pups at his Steinbern ken-
nels. The pups are the offspring of
Pffer Von Bern, German champion of
1937 and American champion of 1937-
1938, and Elsa Rabenﬂug of the Sher-
anston strain.

Steinbern Kennel name was de-
rived from the German word “stein”
meaning stone-—because of the rock
garden surrouunding the dog run, and
Bern because of the Pffer Von Bern
strain in the dogs.

In the last Western Pennsylvania
Kennel club show, Bosko, an eleven-
months-old shepherd pun, owned. by

Hepner won the first novice dog prize ,

and the first prize for local German

Block ‘No Corsage’
Motion at Meeting

Again raising a problem which
has perplexed SFA in the past,
Sam Whiteman, BA40, proposed at
Tuesday’s meeting, “that we do
away with all corsages for all so-
cial events.”

Whiteman said that this would
be a progressive step, especially
when times “are so bad.” His mo-
tion was seconded by Theodore
Biddle, assistant dean of men and
sponsor of the earlier motion.

The motion met the same fate as
predecessor——det‘eat. Only four
votes were recorded in favor of
it: Whiteman, Mr. Biddle, Robert
Adams, C40, and Ted Konetsky,
C41. A.ssembly-women were op-
posed to the motion, as they have
been in the past.

Dorothy Ann Carrier, C41, sug-
gested that the idea be referred to

the Statistics Survey committee to
sample student opiiiioii on the mat-
ter. Whiteman warned the group
that he would revive his motion at 1
the next meeting. ?

Tells of Nazi Rule

i In Czechoslovakia

By John Minno

In the following article John Min-

lates his account, as told to Sam‘Ro—

during the recent crisis.

I felt the greatest thrill of my life

when I looked over the deck bars of
the Georgia to the welcoming hand
of the Statue of Liberty last Friday.
I ﬁnally had made it.

My most exciting experience oc-
curred March 15 when I saw over

60,000 Nazi sol-
diers goose - step
into Prague. On

that day German
sympat h izers
poured out of their
hiding places to
cheer the entering
troops.

They had been
“imported” f o r
‘just this purpose.

After their “Heil
Hitler” _ saluting,
cheering, and

swastika - waving
activities w e r e
completed they, as an entire “cheer-
ing block,” moved on to other Czech
towns. But as this colorful seizure
took place the natives of Czechoslo-
vakia, dumbfounded, could not com-
prehend the meaning of what they
saw.

Finally they began to answer the
cries of “Heil Hitler” with “Zlodie”——-

many brawls, which were permitted
to ﬂourish unrestrained.

Eventually the Czechs crowded in-

FRIDAY, IVIAY 19, 1939

Editor’s lliary

"_ ()l)AY’S Student Opinion Surveys poll, the last

of the present school year, comes up with the
iione-too-startling fact that 60 per cent of Amer-
ican college students have some indictment. to
make of the current state of higher education. The
results were unusually interesting to us, who have
had occasion to discuss our own private gripes
before.

We can’t, however, agree with the prevalent
attitude noted by the Surveys, which deplores the

Lack of Vocational Training . . .

in our colleges and universities. For it seems to us
that our schools have been drifting dangerously to-
ward that extreme. Not, understand, that we are
opposed to vocational education. It is highly ad-
visable, of course, that the University student
should have the opportunity to prepare for some
speciﬁc sort of work.

But he should not.‘ become lop-sided by concen-
tration on that one ﬁeld or vocation. If he is to
obtain the full beneﬁt of a liberal college educa-
tion. he must not specialize too intently but should
try to obtain a background in the various fields of
learning-—tlie social sciences, ﬁne arts, as well as
physical sciences and the more technical studies.

Else what is “education” but a “bread—and-
butter” or a gloriﬁed trade school training, where-
in students think only in terms of preparing thcin-
selves to rake in the liigf-inoiiied positions when
they graduate. Such a system only throws out into
the world, as potential leaders, students of narrow
outlook, who add little in the way of culture aiid
.—undcrstanding in the c0.nsidera.tion. of the prclileins
facing the countries today.

A step in the direction of a more—iiicliisive
education lias been in ken at Carnegie Tech. during
the past year. President Dolierty, aware of the
lop-sidediicss of the engineering Cl1l‘I‘lCllll1lll, helped
iiiauguriite a program to give the engineers “social
consciousness," to make required subjects other
than the <:i;istoiiia1'_y technical studies.

Poll Shows Schooling 
Fails to Meet N cells

By JOE BELDEN, Editor
Student Opinion Surveys of America

cation, in the opinion of the majority of the million and
half college students now getting educated, is not meet-
ing present day needs.

Sixty out of every one hundred students in our col-

The Student Opinion Surveys of America have discov-
ered this in a national poll conducted for The News and
87 other campus publications cooperating in these
studies, on the question, “Generally, do you think edu-
cation is meeting present day needs?”

Want Vocational Training

chronic complainer about his school work. But inter-
viewers for the Surveys found that most of these stu-
dents are able to put into words what they think edu-
cation needs. The great cry is for more vocational
training and specialized study. Overwhelmingly, col-
legians everywhere made that statement—although
many were found who want colleges to change their
courses of study with an emphasis on cultural back-
ground and liberal arts.

Still, approximately, every student approached
seemed to say, “We are getting too much theory that
we cannot use in ﬁnding a job when we step from col-
lege into a world crowded with unemployed.” That
attitude goes hand in hand with a recent poll taken by
the Surveys in which students declared they believe
they are facing a world that offers less opportunities
than it did before they were born.

‘Faults in Curricula’
Whether the American college student is right or
wrong the Surveys do not try to point out. This is
merely a record of what they say and why. For ex-
ample, there are a good many who would like to see
education “atuned to the world of today, modernized.”
Faults, they say, are found in curricula that do not ﬁt
individual needs, and there are many incompetent
teachers. This might be corrected, one student sug-
gested, by paying faculties higher salaries.

Same state that schools should teach more patriotism,
educate people to distinguish between democracy and
“isms.’ There is too much emphasis on grades, some
ho1d—and a few even complain that the courses they
are now taking are “snaps”—too easy.

Local Results

Mirroring national results almost exactly, 59 per
cent of those questioned locally for the Student Opin-.
ion Surveys of America on whether modern educa-
tion was meeting present day needs agreed that it
didn’t.

About one per cent of those questioned had no
opinion on the subject and the other 40 per cent felt
that education was satisfactory to them.

Contrary to reports published in an earlier issue
of this column, Bud Ellis did not take a different girl

to the intersections of the streets,
blocking the tanks and stopping the
parade. In deﬁance they sang their
national anthem “Domovmoy” (My
Home).

The entire demonstration left me
tense. A wild shot at any moment
by a native would have been the
spark that set the power barrel off.

After many hours the crowds were
dispersed and Czechoslovakia became
“unser Czechoslovakia.”

STUDIES INTERRUPTED

Soon following the invasion my
studies were interrupted. I had com-
pleted my ﬁrst semester and attend-
ed but three days of the second when
the government ordered abandon-
ment of the University of Prague.
The building has since been con-
vertcd into an emergency hospital.

The glamorous march into Prague
did not mark the end of the German
seize. Immediately I noticed the in-
jection of German propaganda. My
favorite paper of Prague, “Narvdni
Polika,” the New York Times of
Czechoslovakia, became a disturbing
organ of the government. The editor
and staff remained unchanged. How-
ever, the material used as news came
via the Gestapo, secret service police
of the Nazis.

The favorite subject of the Gestapo
was the Jew. Frequently the head-
lines streamed “Zide Ven’’ —— Jews
out!

CONCENTRATION CAMPS

From a friend who had spent 100
days in a concentration camp I
learned many exciting things. He
told me that all men slept like cows
on straw in one huge room. A sheet-
like cloth constituted their whole
attire. Baths were taboo and lice
roamed freely over the bodies of the
prisoners.

Chores that the prisoners did ‘~.r.'e1*-c
ridiculous and accompzinirs-d by un-
believzible tortures. For example,
aged men, who were broken morally,
pliysically, and fll‘lEtl’lL'lally by the
Nazis, were forced. to rise before 
a. m. ’l."heli' daily task was to spend
“.O‘iI'£llILlO'i,lS hours carrying single
glzissses of water up 5 ﬂights of stairs

to a basin. Their duty was to ﬁll
this basin. In the middle of the
basin, however, was a dime-sized
hole.

as designed by our fashion leaders.

Even the music of Europe has gone
American. I attended a jazz con-
cert in Prague which, incidentally,
was a sell out. The concert was an
imitation of Benny Goodman swing.

While I observed these activities
of the exciting political activities and
simple folkways of Europeans one
thought remained dominant in my
mind. It was: I am glad I am an
American—a citizen of the greatest
country in the world.

Professor E. F. Carpenter, of the
University of Arizona—“College stu-
dents, at least American college stu-
dents, are different from all other
people on this planet; they are the
only people who try to get as little
as possible for their money. They
will spend the most valuable years of
their lives, thousands of dollars of
their parents’ money and some of
their own if they can get any, in try-
ing to derive as little as possible out
of their college courses, provided only
)that they will. receive their coveted
|dip1oma at the end of four years of
‘such effort.”

Perhaps he is right.

We did lend billions of dollars

battle.

We did end up with a national debt
which has never been overcome. We
did suffer from an economic depres-

fensive war.

News Predicts Again;
Picks Pitt over State

A powerful, well-balanced Lio11 will try to stop a proud Panth-
<er’s bid for a two year undefeated streak tomorrow on the State

‘College cinder path.

Another streak at stake is that of The News statistics bureau
which correctly called the exact score of Saturday’s meet with In-

diana.

For the second successive week end We are forecasting a

‘Pitt victory over the head of Coach¢

'Carl Olson, who seldom sees victory
in his crystal ball.

Tomorrow’s contest should be even
closer than the Panther-Hoosier bat-
‘tle at Bloomington. Penn State
seems to be exceptionally strong in
‘Pitts weakest events, and has a
strong backing in the others. In
‘spite of dark forebodings, our method
of prediction claims the Blue and
“Gold should vanquish the Blue and
‘White, 71-64.

‘CUB TEAMS UNDEFEATED

In addition to the varsity fracas
‘that brings together two undefeated
outdoor dual meet teams, the Panther
and Lion cubs tangle. Both yearling
‘outﬁts have well balanced squads, so
‘evenly matched as to prevent us from
“making any predictions on the ﬁnal
outcome.

Pitt’s ﬁrst varsity points will be
earned by Frank Ohl and Larry
’Tregoning as they place one-two in
‘the 100 yard dash. This same duo
will later on ﬁnish in the same posi-
‘tions in the 220 yard dash. In the
latter event Ohl aims to crack both
‘the meet and University marks of 21
ﬂat.

Coach Werner doesn’t possess one
‘top-notch quarter-miler; consequent-
"ly, Al Ferrara, Clyde Graf, and Al
‘McKee will add nine points to the
Panther cause in the 440. Ferrara
learned his lesson last Saturday when
‘he ran himself and Cochran into the
ground, and will make amends for
his novice performance.
WOODRUFF WILL WIN

Captain Johnny Woodruif will
have things entirely his own way in
the 880 and mile; none of the middle
distance stars from Mt. Nittany has
ever approached Long J ohn’s Indiana
‘marks of 1:55.6 and 4:12.8. Griest
of State will push Del Anderson in
‘the four furlong contest for second
place, and in the mile State’s Frank
‘Maule and Al Zamborsky of Pitt
should ﬁnish in the order named for

Finally Clicking . . .

second and third places.

The two mile should produce one
of the most thrilling battles of the
afternoon. Al Boulanger, who shat-
tered the old University two mile
mark by 16.2 seconds in whipping
famed Mel Trutt of Indiana, matches
strides with Len Henderson and
Johnny Strange, who were clocked
in a dead heat ﬁnish at Syracuse Sat-
urday in 9:29.2.

We are picking the Pitt sophomore
star, for in beating Trutt he had
enough stuff left for a double kick
and a 63 second quarter on the gun
lap. The presence of two of the na-
tion’s cross country top-notchers,
Walt Sterner of Pitt and Willy Smith
of State, adds color to the event.

Coach Werner’s timber—toppers,
Captain Miller Frazier, and Bill
Hutchins rate the ﬁrst two places, in
both the hurdle races. Frazier’s time
of 14.6 for the higher obstacles is far
superior to Joe Newman’s 15.3 effort.
Frank Kristl does not rate any bet-
ter than third in the 220 lows.

MORE PREDICTIONS

Dave McDowell, sophomore high
jump star, cleared six feet three
inches at Bloomington, his best ef-
fort, and is better by far than any of
the Staters. He also rates a second
place in the broad jump on the basis
of his 22 feet, 71/4 inch lap last week.
Frank Ohl is a cinch for ﬁrst in this
event. George Clifton, senior pole
vaulter, doesn’t ﬁgure to beat either
George Jackson or Bob Clark, Lion
veterans, in the pole vault.

Johnny Bazyk will outheave Nick
Vukmanic, NCAA javelin champ, in
the shot put, and if the spear-tossing
ace’s sore arm still bothers him,
Johnny will take the discus. Vuk-
manic will capture his specialty with
ease and State’s Dean Hanley should
also earn second place. Ted‘ Konet-
sky will vie with Hanley for the re-
maining places in the shot and dis-
cus. The hammer throw will be a
sweep for the Blue and White.

iiufek and McLaughlin beat McClos-
key and Hulton; Harmuth and
Goehring won over Bingham and
Moorhead; but P. Gilles and J . Gilles _
took the measure of Smith and Carl’
'Kaufman.

Last Wednesday the Pitt squad‘
hit the high spot of the season with
a smashing 8-1 triumph over West
Virginia. Only the number 2 sin-
gles, in which Harmuth lost a tough
one to Elsey, went to the Mountain-
eer contingent. Kristufek trounced
Dudderar; McLaughlin defeated Cof-

Stark’s ﬂutfit
Tops Mendlow

Well sir, Mr. Stark and his inde-
pendents ﬁnally beat the fraternity
league Tuesday. The little-public-
ized Gamma Gamma Woo nine
snapped Sigma Alpha Mu’s game
winning streak with a 14-8 win.

Jules Cuburnek kept things pretty
well under control for the independ-
ent champs, while Lew Mendlow
failed in his bid for a second victory
in two days. The big southpaw’s
ﬂipper went dead early in the ball
game, leaving “Cookie” Kurtz on the
wrong end of a six run GGW rally in
the sixth which clinched the win.

With the score tied going into the
sixth, the winners staged a scoring
party on ﬁve hits and a walk, cli-

maxed by Kramer’s home run. Was- -

serman, Mendlow, and Rossen were
the leading SAM hitters, producing
ten safe swats among them; Aaron’s
3 hits lead the independent attack. A

On Wednesday, SAM outlasted Oil
and Gas in a thrilling 17-15 battle.
The fraters had to call on “meal
ticket” Lew Mendlow’s sore left arm
to save the game, and Lew finally
came through in a struggle that went
two extra innings.

Hurwitz and Chickerneo were both
hammered consistently, with

into the sixth. Mendlow was called
in to prot-ec't the lead at this point,
but after striking out the side in the
sixth lost control anti al.l~f>wc<‘l the
engineers to tie the score in the final

FRIDAY, MAY 19, 1939

By Bill McElWain
After a. layoff of nine days
from intercollegiate competition
Ralph Mitterling takes his base-

ballers to Indiana, Pa., tomorrow-

with more than just a hope for a
win over the Indiana State Teach-
ers nine.

In brief, the Panthers feel conﬁdent
that they will be back on campus
Monday with their second win of the
season laid away in the records.

A tipoff on the strength of the
Teachers may be found in the 5-4 de-
feat handed them last Monday by
Kiski Prep. Held to six hits by
Kiskis Dudley, Indiana trailed 5-2
until the ninth inning. Golish, In-
diana pitcher, drove out two of his
club’s six safe blows.

SLUMP’S END

Just as much in Pitt’s favor as the
lack of punch shown by Indiana is
the hitting slump from which Panther
batters should emerge tomorrow.
Until the Penn State series, the Ca-
thedralites had pounded all kinds of
pitching even when losing, but three
Lion chuckers made Mitterling’s
bombers resemble nothing more than
duds. V

But it is the depths of pessimism
to expect the Panthers to repeat their

performance of only nine safeties in ‘

two games. Blasting Bobby Foliart
is past due to come out of his slump,
and Frank Goelz should hit much
better than he has in recent clashes.

Al Holbrook may not start at sec-

AL HOLBROOK
. may sit it out . . .

ond base tomorrow if his broken
ﬁnger continues to bother him. Hol-
brook snapped a bone in the ﬁnger
just before the State doubleheader

and played the ﬁrst game with no
protection on the injury. By the
beginning of the nightcap, the ﬁnger
was swollen considerably, and after
having it tightly bandaged, Al went
through seven more innings with the
handicap.

At the present time, the ﬁnger is
in splints, making it almost impossi-
ble for Holbrook to throw with ac-
curacy or hold a bat properly. If he
is given a rest, either Eddie Hughes
or Bill Brown will probably take
over the keystone sack duties.
LINEUP CHANGES

Several other changes in the make-
up of the traveling squad and start-
ing lineup are likely to stick. Little
Pat Patterson will open in right ﬁeld
in place of Ed Kieper, and Lefty
Drobnuski is scheduled to cover ﬁrst,
Phil Scheiding’s former stronghold.

It Mitterling carries only two
catchers, Guy Guadagnino will go
along rather than Eddie Salko.
George Hartman will start back of
the plate as he has in all but one
game. Ed Lawry_ has been shoved
into the “favored four” of the pitch-
ing’ staff and the axe has, temporar-
ily at least, fallen on Red Pommer-
schein.

As for the rest of the club, no
further revamping is contemplated
for a while. Foliart and Straloski
will continue to form a strong com-

bination on the left side of the in-

ﬁeld‘, while Goelz and Al Butch hold
down their regular outﬁeld positions.

eliinksmen Play
Hillbilly Golfers
In Repeat Battle

Pitt ’s golfmen will get another
chance at the ‘Nest Virginia
swingers tomorrow morning on
the Alcoma links.

The Panthers opened the sea-
son with the Mountaineers and
received a 71/2 -21/2 setback. From all
indications the Hillbilly contingent is
all set for a repeat performance un-
less it has suddenly been seized with
an attack of extreme self-conﬁdence,
incited by a glance at the Panther
record.

V West Virginia has been burning up
the links this season with golfers
Graham, Hopkins, and Lipucci con-
tinually breaking into print. The
presence of Tony Kaye in the Pitt
line-up may spell the diﬁerence be-
tween victory or defeat, for Tony
failed to play in the ﬁrst encounter.
The rear guard, judging from their
showing in the Grove City meet, can
be counted on to turn in a few wins,
maybe.

Last Tuesday Pitt took the Grove
City outﬁt, 8-1, with Tony Kaye
starring. Kaye turned in the medal
score, a low 70, two under par on
the Alcoma course. Daddio contin-
ued winning, Reilly chalked up an-
other win, and Seybold caught the
spirit, turning in a victory. Geyer,
a recruit, dropped the only match.
Pitt took all three best ball mtaches.

The Eastern Intercollegiate Golf
Association is all over as far as the
Panthers are concerned. They ﬁn-
ished last in their _division with 1
win and 4 defeats. Today Dartmouth
.meets Yale and tomorrow Princeton
.meets the Friday winner for the EIA
championship.

Views Athletics

Associated Collegiate Press

The records of the National Inter-
collegiate Athletic Association meet-
ings reveal much argument over the
pros and cons of subsidy, until at one
meeting a man came along with a
new idea.

He was President James L. Mc-
Conaughy of Wesleyan university
who says he is in favor of a laissez-
faire attitude toward proselyting and
paying athletes. He would like to see
each college allowed to carry out their
athletic program in their own way. ~

Dr. McConaughy says, “If an insti-
tution decides to proselyte to secure
a football team, and pay them in any
way as players, it does this because
it believes that the assets outweigh
the liabilities of this program.”

He clearly shows that presidents of
different types of colleges are now
facing situations which make athletic
subsidation a wise policy for their
particular institutions. He also clear-
ly shows that there are college presi-
dents for whom a non-subsidizing
policy is most suitable.

He generalizes: “We don’t expect
all institutions to be alike in other
matters; why should we expect it of
athletic programs?” He points out
that in no other phase of , collegiate
activity do any two colleges use ex-
actly the same tactics.

Fantasy . .

Educator John Dewey, University
of Vermont Alumnus-——“There is con-
fusion and conﬂict in education be-
cause there is confusion and conﬁict
in social life. This much is inevita-
ble. But that we are going back to
that complete separation between
knowledge and practice, between the
intellectual life and the natural
sciences, which existed in earlier
days is but a fantasy of those who do
not understand why and how the
present educational system has grown
out of its earlier condition.”
