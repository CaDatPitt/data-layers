UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

arifies Position on Regionalism - 

CottamReveals Causes,
“Views and Solutions

Of Middle East Crisis

by HALDUN K. SCIIUELER

“To grasp the essentials of the Israeli-Arab crisis one
must understand the reality of how people see things,”
according to Dr. Richard Cottam, professor of political sci-
ence at the University and specialist in Middle East affairs.
Professor Cottam addressed over 150 members of the aca-
demic and local community in his talk on the Israeli-Ar-ab
crisis last night. The program was sponsored by Western
Pennsylvania Academic Committee and the Students for

Peace.

Professor Cottam’s view which is based on the theory of em-

«pathy entails experiencing the “sense of outrage” felt by both they '

Arabs and the Israelis.

“The Arabs, betrayed by -the British after World War I, have

viewed the state of Israel as

“an advance guard of British im-
perialism designed to keep the
Arabs colonialized.” Today, the
Arab picture -is one of an “un-
holy alliance of the British,

T Americans, Jews and traditional-

Discusses Middle East

ist Arabs working to prevent
the freedom and dignity of the
Arab nations.”

The Israeli picture has been
one of search for hope and se-
curity following the genecide in
Germany. This according to Cot-
tam, “may be one of the cruelist
acts that man has ever known.”

“Both have experienced out-
rage,” Cottam pointed out. Here
are “two people who believe (in
the moral justice of their case.”

Some - Israelis, particularly,
Foreign Minister Abba Eban,
understand the Arabs. They un-
derstand the intensity of moral
outrage that the Arabs feel.
“'llhis,” said Cot-tam, “prov-ides
some optimism for a peaceful
settlement.”

“Much of what happened is
the result of accident. The Arabs,
encouraged by a USSR intelli-
gence report that Israel was
about to launch an attack on
Syria, began a frantic prepara-
tion. “What's important,” said
Cottam, “is that the Arabs ac-
tually believed this report.” Fur-
thermore, “the blockade of the
Gulf of Aquaba was inadver-
tent. Na.sser’s behavior,” re-

marked Cottom, “was a reﬂec-
tion of the people's will.”

Serving Nation Is Achieved 

By Solving Local Problems

See Editorial, Page 4
“It is wrong, I think, to
try to distinguish between
Pitt’s role as an ‘urban” or
‘regional’ university and a
university with a national

a n d international interest,

said Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar in aspeech given’
yesterday before the annual
dinner of the Negro Emergency
Education Drive. '

“Every university has a con-
stituency, ‘by simple virtue of
its locatio-n,” stated Posvar. -“It

Harvard Losing

by DOUGLAS STANTON
Hertz Rent-A—Car is not

the only institution which
is having trouble staying on

top. The other is none other

than Harvard University.

In an article in Science
Magazine, published by the
American Association f o r
the Advancement of Science
Bryce Nelson, describes how
Harvard, “. .' . like every other
university in the country, is
having trouble attracting fac-
ulty members.” ’

According to Dr. Charles H.
Peake, vice—ch~ancellor for aca-

demic disciplines, this is just as '

true for the University. “There
are two factors which are in-
tensifying the competitive sit-
uation for professors,” said Dr.
Peake.

“One factor is the new system
of state schools in New York
State and California, and the
newly converted teachers col-
ieges in Illinois. These schools
have nothing else to offer so
they attract professors with very
high salaries. Another factor,”
said Dr. Peake, “is that many
schools are offering extensive
perquisites along with high sal-
a.ries.”_ These include retirement
premiums, special research funds
and clerical assistance. 1

Despite the fact that Harvard
has the highest average faculty
salary in the nation, the mone-
tary factors mentioned by Dr.
Peake also affect Harvard. But
Nelson points out that the main
com-plaint is over Harvard’s sys-
tern of obtaining tenure.

At Harvard, a new Ph.D. must
spend three years as an instruc-
tor and ﬁve years as an assis-
tant professor, and then only
one out of every -three-- or four
assistant professors receives a
professorship. According to Dr.
Peake, “The competitive situa-
txon for professors is causing
the ‘instructorship at the Uni-
versity to become extinct.”

Most new Ph.D.’s at the Uni-
versity spend two three-year

terms as an assistant professor ,

 

    

 :-  ~ '.’-3   -5-.-. .. .:_~'«_.‘.  -

and receive tenure if they are
appointed to an associate profes-
sorship. Although the instruc-
tor at Harvard can be consider-
ed equivalent to the assistant
professor at the University, ten-
ure can come two years sooner
here.

Author Nelson points out that

_ Harvard loses many of its jun-

ior faculty in “raids” by other
universities. Dr. Peake stated
that the University is “constant-
ly” getting new faculty mem-
bers from the junior faculty of

‘ Harvard and of other Ivy League

schools.

More alarming than raids on
its junior faculty, Harvard is
concerned that they can no long-
er count on professors at other
institutions to eagerly accept
professorships at Harvard. Dr.
Peakt could not remember any
denials to Harvard, but he did
point out that recently, “Two of
the University’s most prominent
professors turned. _doWn posi-
tions offered to them at Yale.”

Although Harvard has the
highest average salary, many

may be Columbus, or Dubuque,
or Brady's Bend. Ours, fortu-
nately happens to be Pittsburgh
whose problems are common to
all of 20th century society. So in
the very act of servicing our

locality,” he stressed, “we can --

become both a national as-set
and an international intellectual
force.”

In Posvar’s view, “a universi-
ty by its very nature must be
cosmopolitan. We would be fail-
ing our region if we were not,”
he pointed out.

“We would be failing the stu-
dents of Pennsylvania if we did

not bring them into close asso-
ciation with students‘ from other
states and nations.”

He emphasized that “we would
be failing our industrial support-
ers if we persued -the outdated

notion that regional problems.

are distinct from national and
international problems. They
know this at Westinghouse,”
said Posvar, “whose executives

and their wives we have been *-

helping to prepare for overseas
assignments for the past few
years. They know this at the
Gulf Oil Corporation, where
cri.-sis in the Middle East can
have a direct effect on the jobs
and lives of men and women
who live next door.”

Chancellor Posvar also spoke
brieﬂy on the “new status of
state-relatedness of the Univer-
sity.” He asserted that the Uni-
versity could continue to drive
for scholastic excellence under-
this “new statu-s.”

He delved into the essen-
tials of public and private ﬁnan-
cial support by stating that he

thought that the University’s ‘

“program of ﬁnancial support
from a mixture of sources is go-
ing to become a typical model

for universities. “It is represent ~

ative,” he pointed out, “of what
is happening and what will hap-
pen all over the country.”
Looking at -the pattern of ﬁ-
nancial assistance a bit more
closely, Posvar thought _it proper
to funnel public funds into such
areas as‘ tuition reduction, basic

operations, and capital expan-- ,;
sion. The achievement of cul- i

tural advances, of high stand-
ards in the professions, and serv-
-ice to industry through research
and training,” said Posvar,
“make up the proper sector for

private support . . . and our own,

needs for private in this sector
are greater than ever.”

‘News,’ WPGH Cop Prizes  

In Journalism Contest

Pi Delta ‘Epsilon, -the honor-
ary collegiate journalism frater-
nity, has awarded ﬁve prizes to
the Pitt News and one to W‘-PGH
in its annual Newspaper and

were 157 entries in the sports
news contest.

Both other newspaper awards

were for photography and went

aries at the University are kept
I’ :-within the same limits, endowed

“This is exactly what the Uni-

for,” stated Dr. Peake. “Even the
most illustrious professors teach
undergraduates here.” _

“The University is also aware,”
continued Dr. Peake, “that ‘along
with salary and beneﬁts, teach-
ing loads are part of the com-
petition for professors. Our com-
petitors are lowering their teach-
ing loads so we will have to low-

Cottam Talks
On Crisis

(Continued from Page 1)
its 1956 agreement, decided that
the Arabs would -have to be stop-‘ --
ped,” Cottam pointed out.

“Thus, the crisis began. It"
ended withdefeat andiia loss of
bargaining power for the Arab
states, and an “increase in cred-
ibility and bargaining power for
Israel."

Professor Cottam made two
perceptions: first, “the Soviets
are indeed a ‘paper tiger,’ not
willing to even take us on in

_ their own back yards.” Second,

“the solution in the Middle East 1

lies in a ‘detente.’ between the
USSR and the U.S.”

Professor Cottam’s proposals
for a settlement were the fol-
lowing:

>“A large UN combat force
in the Middle East conﬂict areas
with a group of men attached
to no state deciding when there
is aggression.”

> Phase disarmament.

>“Agreement of the UN to
pay complete costs of the set-
tlement of refugees.”

>'I‘-he U.S. and USSR should
refuse to take side&—no inter-
vention in internal Arab dis-
putes.”

Hallowe d tradition
of "pinning" a girl is

up-dated by   -   

Sprite bottle caps .

According to an independent survey (we took it
ourselves), a startling new practice is becoming
widespread on some college campuses.

Suddenly, fraternity men are no longer "pinning"
the lovely young things that catch their eye.

Instead, they reach for a bottle of tart,
tingling Sprite--and proceed to "cap"
their affections.

Why has this
come about?
Perhaps because
ofwhathappens
. when you go
throughtheceremony.ofopening' a bottle ofsprite.
It fizzes! Roars! Buzzes! Tingles!Bubbles!

All of which makes for a much more moving moment
than to simply "pin" a girl.

Then, too, the intimacy of two people engaged
in the act of opening a bottle of Sprite in itself
leads to strong emotional involvement.

Capped off, of course, by the sharing of a
few moments of delicious abandon. (Tasting the
tingling tartness of Sprite, that is.)

The beauty of the idea is that if the course
of true love does not run smooth, you don't have
to go to the trouble of getting back your pin.

You just buy another bottle of Sprite.

’ - In discussing this topic, Dr. Posvar emphasized, “Every University
.- has a constituency, by simple virtue of its location . . . Ours, fortunately,
'— _ happens to be Pittsburgh, Whose problems are common to all of 20th
century society.” He then proceeded to illustrate the importance of relat-
ing the problems of our own region to the problems of other societies.
A The Chancellor’s comments are significant to us in light of the past
Controversy over whether the University would or s'hould became a re-
gional university. because of its state-rrelated status. Students are, of
course, adverse to that occurrence, and feel that the lower percentage of
-out-of-state students in this year’s incoming freshman class is a step in

the wrong direction.

Dr. Posvar presented another aspect of the “regional” issue in his
' address last evening, one that might be misinterpreted upon first reading
excerpts of his speech. He‘ is in no Way defending the purpose served by

 A Problem   To R

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar delivered his first public address last
night since he assumed his position June 1. During the course of his
speech to the Negro Educational Emlergency Drive members, he touched
upon several points that are directly related to the issue of our University

 
     

Some Questions To Answer

‘ The Pitt News.)

THE RECENT controversy
over the policy of our Universi-
ty Book Center requires that
several points be m-ade clear -to
reinforce -the student viewpoint

 ,’ on this issue.

Before ‘any meaningful discus-.

‘  sion can take place on this topic,

however, there must be a sin-
cere attempt on the part of the

We agree with this statement, just as we concur with Dr. Posvar’s
remark that “We would be failing the students of Pennsylvania if we did
not bring them into close association with students from other nations.”

beneﬁts to supplement what
was promised them on paper but
never came to pass.

In line with thi-s thinking is
the student discount at the Book
Center that was requested by
the student body in the form of
a petition at the end of the Win-
ter Term and was endorsed by
Chancellor Emeritus David H.
Kurtzman. We must stand ﬁrm
on our request for this discount
that is now available to the ad-
ministrati-on, faculty, and staff
of our University, but not to the
students.

A KEY issue to be discussed
before this controversy can be
effectively resolved, however, is
a decision as to what is the pri-
mary purpose of our Book Cen-
ter. The purpose o-f the Book
Center is to best fulﬁll the needs
of the students. If it is not per-
forming that‘ duty, no matter
how grandiose -its illusions, the
Book Center cannot fulﬁll its
real purpose——4to serve our stu-
dent body. A university Book
Centershould exist for the stu-
dents, not for the City of Pitts-
burgh. While we certainly have
a duty to the community, is not
our primary duty to the Univer-
s-ity students?

The recently established Com-
mittee to Review the Book Cen-
ter Policy is a step in the right
direction only if all the mem-
bers recognize the students’
needs. For unless this is done,

state student ratio, the Chancellor told The Pitt News that he has asked
for a study on this topic, to be conducted by Student Affairs and the Of-
fice of Admissions. One problem that will be reviewed by this committee
is the lack of dormitory space until our new dorms will be completed in a
few years. If a satisfactory means of providing widespread off—campus
housing can be found, we will not have to wait several years to‘ accept
greater numbers of out-of-state students.

Dr. Posvar is taking a step _in the right direction by establishing
a committee to resolve the problem our lack of dorm space has created
in forcing the University to accept primarily Pennsylvania students. If a
solution can be found, the students currently enrolled in our University
will benefit from a diverse student body just as theiimmediate classes be-
fore us did. If the University can find a solution, it will be providing the
vital service to its constituents — the students — that is so essential to

‘Pitt News’

Statement

of Letters’ Policy

In the _ past few weeks, the
Pitt News has published a num-
ber of letters, some of them un-
signed, which are in the nature
of personal criticism of people
involved with this University.
We believe, therefore, that it is
necessary for us to restate our
policy on Letters to the Editor.

From now on, the Pitt News
will publish no letter of per-
sonal criticism unless the writer

signs his name and allows it to;

be printed. These writers show
no hesitancy in naming names,
and we believe they should be
willing to reciprocate.

Two of these letters have been
aimed atsoccer coach Leo Be-
mis. While not in any way com.-
menting on his coaching meth-
ods, we believe that he, along
with all other individuals de-
serves the right of accuracy. We
do not believe than an obvious
distortion of the facts should go
unanswered.

Column Policy

Columns appearing on the
editorial page of The [Pitt
News reflect solely the opin.
ion of the author, and are not
to be construed as reﬂecting
theopinion of either the edi-
torial board or the editor. Un-
less otherwise speciﬁed, edi.
torial Columns are written .by
members of the editorial board.

   

 

Therefore, we wish to correct
a few of the “facts” which were
stated in two unsigned letters.
First, the former player said
that at Michigan State one play-
er put on his uniform at 9 in
the morning in hotel room be-
cause he couldn’t believe that
Mr. Bemis had got them a. lock.
er room. As a matter of fact, the
players had used the locker room

the day before for a short prac-

tice.

Mr.‘Bemis is also blamed for
not setting a deﬁnite practice
time when in reality this was
due‘ to many players being re-
quired to attend labs, and for
using the carnpus bus for one
game, when the blame for this
lies with the Athletic Depart-
ment. These are just a few of
the misrepresentations which,
we believe, greatly reflect on the
credibility of the letters as a
whole.

Editor, The Pitt News:

The large urban university is
viewed by many as a place of
anonimity, isolation, and aliena-
tion. The_ average student feels
lost, an IBM card number in an
atmosphere of large classes,
small faculty, and little com»
munication. Teachers, too, ex-
perience th-is, compounded with
the concern for what is getting
through to the students. How
can 250 students get to really
know one teacher, and vice
versa?

Obviously, the classroom lec-
iture -si-tu-ation will not change
—-‘how can it? . . .not enough
money, n-ot enough teachers, too
many students, not enough mon-
ey . . . ad inﬁnitum! Nonethe-
less, something can be and has
-been done to improve the rela-
tionship between faculty and
students. The recently ini-tiaited
St-udenit-Faculty.-Seminar enables
students to get -know and ex-
change ideas with students and
faculty of various disciipilines.

Recently, the experimental
ﬁlm, The Hand, was presented
for discussion. The interpreta-
:-tions brought out were as num-
erous as the participants in the
Seminar. *

We, as well as most of the
other participants in the Stut-
dent -. Faculty Seminar, found
this to be a very rewarding ex-
perience. We are eagerly look-
ing forward to other Seminars
in the future.

(The following article is reprint-
ed from the Camden Post in Cam-

ior enrolled in the School of Lib-
eral Arts.)

“Were there to be a war I
would-n-’~t leave . . . people are
coming to help and volunteer
all sorts of services and I’ll
leave?”

These words were written by
a 20-year old Haddonﬁeld stu-
dent studying in J erusalem’s He-
brew University. They were writ-
ten only a few days before ﬁght-
ing erupted between Israel and
the Arab. states. .

(Last night Abba Eban, fo-r-
eign minister of Israel, speaking
before the United Nations an-
nounced that the university was
one of the buildings hit by artil-
lery shells from Jordan.)

In letters sent to her family
before the outbreak of war, Miss
Ruth E. Levikoff tells of events
and feelings preceeding the con-
ﬂict. ‘She is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Jack Levikoff of 711
W. Greenman Road.

Miss Levikoff, who attends
the University of Pittsburgh, is
spending lier junior year study-
ing at the Israeli university un-
der a student program spon-
sored by the American Friends
Society. Since ﬁghting broke out,
her parents have received no
word from her.

Following ‘are excerpts from‘

her recent letters:
Tuesday, May 23 —
Dear Folks: -

Don’t press the panic button—
I'm safe and sound and will re-
 so. Heard Johnso_n’s and
the U.S. Embassy of the Middle
East suggestion to evacuate-at
this point, in particular, the
thought is absurd! I shall not
leave!

I shall continue going to class-
es and take my exams come hell
or high water-—and it’s not just
a matter of the year’s credit and
time—I have no intention of
leaving until I had originally
planned.

You over there worry and
have more reason to than I here,
knowing the situation and my
situation. I do not envy the par-'
ental role, it’s a hard one—but
try not to worry—there’-s no
cause. I am 20, and when and
if I see the need, I shall not be
the recipient of parental com-
mands to return westward.

I’m not frightened, worried,
nor mouselike. Do not ﬁll your
letters with these demands or
insults to my integrity in this

matter—-—I want to read your-

mail and enjoy it—don’t take

away -this enjoyment and make, .

me not want to open your let-
ters. /

I write all of this in anticipa-
tion of your reactions—but I do
hope they will not fulﬁll those

anticipations and you will under- '

stand and rely on me to take
care of myself. Love.
Wednesday, May 24
To My Dear and wonderful ‘
parents and Sue of course: -

I realize the letter I sent you
yesterday rather harshly out-
lined my in-tentions and feelings
about the Middle East crisis.-I
felt I had to assert myself, while
at the s-ame time I wanted to
feel that you have faith in me
and trust my judgment as a
20% year old adult—no longer
your child, but your offspring
who has sprung.

On the other hand, I realize
that the tone of my letter was
not as mature as it should have
been, especially if one of my

propositions is that I am old
enough -to handle my affairs (it’s
a shame I’m not ﬁnancially in-
dependent so that it would have
a t=ruer ring when I say that).
Thirdly, having heard of the
“moves” of various frantic par-
cnts in the past few days—tele-

give you any ideas) I was re-
acting against “their moves” as

things not so worthy to worry)

“The forthcoming merger of

A TIME FOR FUN ,

There are some _sportswriters and broadcasters who
I. take the view that sports is a serious, intricate business.
‘ These people believe that the public must be made aware
of every conceivable angle and every relevant description.
’ They also feel that it's their job to do the informing, af-
“ltenregardless of the validity of their insight.

' Then there are those sportswriters and broadcasters
who take columnist Larry Merchant’s view. “Sports is fun
and games, not the48Iuremberg trials,” says Merchant.

_, Lindsay - Nelson has broadcast sports events rangeing
— from professional and college football to major league base-
pball to NBA basketball. As a member ofgthe N. Y.cMets
. broadcasting team, he was in Pittsburgh last week and he
7 _had a -chance to express some of his opinions on a broad-
" caster’s responsibility. I _ e “

. “A LOT_ OF PEOPLE. treat sports like a chess game,”
, Nelson said. “There’s a cause and effect for everything that
"happens. A

“Personally, I think that sports is far over explained,”
he continued. “People don’t pay to see a chess ‘game. For
“example, many times a ballplayer will do something on the
-ﬁeld-and in the morning paper he’ll read a half dozen rea-
sons for why he did it. But actually, he just did it. I don’t
think people like to read or hear about the complex ex-
planation for his action.” -

._ For Nelson, the efforts of people in his business should
. be geared towards stimulating the enthusiasm inherent in
‘sports. He points out the current trend away from the
ballplayer by the medias. -

*‘YOU’LL NOTICE that the ballplayer doesn’t get
much of a play anymore,” he said. “Everybody’s concerned
with. franchises, general managers, and unions.” He in-
ferred that the essence of sports is the aura of enthusiasm
it creates and not the artiﬁcial sidelines. A

» ‘,‘That’s why I enjoy college football so much,” explain-
ed?» Nelson. “Pro football has tried without success to cap-
ture the enthusiasm _the college game has.” ‘

. He adimtted, however, that the pro games are much
easier to broadcast than the college encounters. “I spend
a -quarter of the time to prepare for a pro game,” he con-
ﬁded. “The pros use the same formations, the same person-
nel year after year, and the stadia are ~usua1ly.closer to the
ﬁeld. Even the numbers on their uniforms are bigger.”

 
  
  
 

  
  

  
   
  
  
   
   
   
  
  
  
 
   
   
  
  
    
   
  
  
   
 
 
 
  
  
  
   
  
   
 
  
 
 
   
  
   
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
 
  
   
   
    
    
  
 

paredto other sports. f‘Football is more intense than, say,
baseball,” he said. “Football games are a week apart, ‘so that
gytheotime-of the opening kickoff, your work’.s just about
one. . . A

“Baseball, on the other ‘hand, is away of life,” he went
on day and twice on Sunday. And too, a baseball player is-
more relaxed. You can talk freely with him, whereas a foot-
ball player may not know where he is a half-hour before the
game.” i «
 Nelson described baseball announcers as essentially disc_
jockeys. “There's so much time to ﬁll,” he pointed out, “that”
you spend most of your time keeping your audience inter-
ested.” ' ‘
‘Contrary to popular though, basketball is the easiest
[sport to broadcast. “It sounds so tough to everyone,”’Ne1son
7said. “But actually the six years I did the NBA Game of the
;Weekiwere the easiest‘I’ve had. I could almost fall asleep
describing the play. The action is so concentrated that you
'fcan’t miss any of it.” '

in identifying a player, Nelson feels that he should always
correct it. “You’re doing a bad job if you try to finesse your

gay out of it,” he said. “You should try to be as accurate as
you can, and you’re really the only judge of how you’re
doing.” . A
._ Nelson cited this year’s Rose Bowl and Pro Bowl games
as examples. “After the Purdue-UCLA game, the Cincinatti
Enquirer wrote that my broadcast was the -most horrible job
they'd ever heard,” he recalled. “But the -N. Y. World Jour-
-nal Tribune said it was the best job ever on television.

threw a touchdown pass to a ﬂankerback I kept calling Gale
Sayers,” he contnued. “But after the receiver sidestepped
a- few defenders, I know it wasn’t Sayers. It turned out to
be Ken Williard and there wasn’t anything I could do ex-
cept "correct myself on the air.”

, . If Lindsay Nelson can convey speed, accuracy, and en-
thusiasm the play he sees in person to the audience at home,
he ccnsders his_j.ob well done. But most announcers have
the speed and the accuracy. _ '

Sign Major League

by MIKE BROURMAN

Welty May Leave Panthers,
Contract

__ 4 Dave Welty, explains one scout, is a typical lefthanded pitcher. “He’s not normal.
No southpaw is,” the scout continued. “There’s something about them. They just don’t

throw like regular people.”

Looking at Welty at the top of his windup, one would _tend to agree. His left
arm distended, theforearm twisted, the wrist cocked a full half-turn farther, he seems

incapable of pitching.

But a split second la-ter he uncoils and the ball explodes. across -the plate, eluding contact

with the enemy bat.

His -success at eluding.enemy bats has been so great that in this, his second year of varsity

will return next year for his ﬁnal season.

As Dave Welty himself puts
it, “This was a great ‘year for
me and my bargaining power is
at its best. If a couple of de-
tails can be worked out, I'll
probably" sign a pro contract
this summer.”

The two details which Welty
is trying to clear up are ﬁrst,
his draft status, and ‘second, his
education. Welty minimizes the
importance of neither.

“Whatever decision is made,"
he says,=“I’m going to ﬁnish my
education. No matter what. So
we'd have to settle on that.”

The “we” refers to a major
league team, and Welty is p_r_'e-t:ty
sure that they will meet that re-
quest. As he points out, “There’s
a couple of boys at Pitt right
now who signed pro contracts.
The team sends them to school
in the oif-season.”

. A‘ much bigger obstacle. and
much less generous than major
league ball clubs is the United
States Army in general and the
Draft Board in particular. “Let’s
face it,” Welty explains. “I’ve

’ got to go, Everybody’s got to go

for at least six months. So I’m
trying to get into the reserves
so I can go in the off-season.”
The crisis in Vietnam has cre-
ated a massive frontal attackon

reserve units all over the coun-‘

try, as Welty has discovered.
“It’s -awful tough to get in. The
waiting list for some units is a
year and a half.” ‘

As certain lawmakers ‘have
discovered, big league sports
franchises have an "uncanny
knack of placing their 1-A stars
in the reserves. But, at least
until August, Welty cannot ben-
e-ﬁ-t from this approach.

For, the major leagues passed
a rule which makes it illegal for
scouts to contact college play-

ers until they have been -out of

  

' ball, he lead_ all college pitchers in strikeouts. This same success also‘ makes it doubtful that he

ALONG with his pitching, Welty was one of the best hitters on

the team, batting .330. He expects to continue playing the outﬁeld

when he's not pitching in the minors, thus giving him a better
' shot at the majors. ’

though Welty knows the scouts
are interested in him, they ’can’t
discuss terms with him until
August.

Until then, Dave intends to '

try and settle the draft problem
on his own. But, he is confident
that if he can't solve it, when
August rolls around one of th
big league clubs will. '

This conﬁdence has led Welty
to reﬂect over another problem,
one that is the deep concern of
every red-blooded, 19 year old
pitch—Money.

“As far as me knowing what
I'm worth, I couldn't say,” Wel-
ty adm-its. “What makes it hard-
er is that I can't talk to the
clubs, so I really have no idea.”

“But I would say that it would

have to be something big enough. .

I don’t think I would sign on a
shaky deal.” After ‘further delib-
eration‘, he came up with the
figure $25,000.

“If you have a chance to make

it and the club has a, lot, of
a money 1‘-i‘.’~‘?5t°<1.-i'i=‘Y°‘.1:--‘hf?‘°W’ i

 

‘ jthenl‘.

  

usually will push you along;
stick with you 1onger,” Welty
explains. “And if you don’t make
it, you will have t-he money.”

“I won’t just go straight in
without having something to fall
back on just in case. ’I‘hat’s—why
I'm going to make sure that I
get a good bonus and that's why
I’m going to ﬁnish my educa-
tion.’ ’

Despite the obstacles in his
path, Welty believes that a. so-
lution is forthcoming. “Some-
thing can be worked ou ,” he
insists.

He realizes that if he plays
another year here, there's a
chance that his value on the
open marked may be increased.
He also realizes that it may de-
crease if, for instance, he is in-
jured.

“A lot of things can happen
between now ‘and next year,”he
says._ But for now it looks like
playing for Pitt won't be one of

(SPECIAL TO THE PITT NEWS)

Zeta Beta Tau" stunned the Graduate
School champions with their second
straight victory to capture the all-campus
softball championship last Thursday at
Trees Field.

ZBT twice came from behind to post a
12-8 defeat on the Grads, a team which hadn’t
lost a game in the past two years.

As in their previous contest, the Zeebs were
led by centerﬁelder Jeff Heimberg. Heimberg
drove in ﬁve of the 12 runs scored to raise his
league-leading RBI total to 25.

If, was evident from the ﬁrst inning that the
game would be played differently from the league
title game won by the Zeebs the day before. The

Pitt football team had then managed only three
hits against ZBT pitcher Jay Rosenstein, but the
Grads jumped on Rosenstein for four hits their
first time up. - .

Safeties by Bill Ott, Randy Smith, Don May-
ﬁeld, and A1 Tartaglia scored two quick runs for
the Grads in the top of the ﬁrst. ZBT came back
with one in their half of the inning on singles
by.Bi1l Goldstein and Joel Schlesinger and a
ground rule double over the right ﬁeld fence by
Heimberg. _ L

'I‘=he score held until the bottom of the third
when the Zeebs scored three times. Goldstein and
Jeff Gerson stroked back-to-back singles, and
Schles-inger followed with a double to drive in
Goldstein. Heimberg and Bob Ziff then lofted
sacriﬁce ﬂies to put ZBT ahead for the ﬁrst time,

  4-2. ' .

A New Coach

Dr. Darrell Lewis, who became freshman football coach
10 days ago, will have two graduate assistants with coach-
ing experience to aid him in directing the Panther Cubs
next season. '

Lewis has adjusted his dental practice so that he can
devote full-time attention to the freshman squad. Steve
Petro, who handled the Cubs last year, can now concentrate
on working with the varsity as the offensive guard coach.

The latest reports on Panthe-r halfback Denny Ferris
indicate that his eye is slowly healing, although he can’t
see out of it yet. Ferris’ doctor had originally planned to
sew the eye shut for approximately six months, which
would have meant no football for F_erris next fall.

As it is, Ferris must be listed as doubtful for the Sept.
23 opener against UCLA. He injured the eye in a freak
accident while on a construction job last month.

Coaches Dave Hart, Leo Bemis, and Bobby Lewis are
all hoping that the new athletic ﬁelds behind Trees Hall
will be 1'eady for the fall. The State’s General Authority
wants to hand the ﬁelds over to the University but since
they haven’t been completed, the University won’t accept
them.

It seems that the contractor for the ﬁelds has gone
bankrupt and Athletic Director Frank Carver is currently
attempting to work out a solution.

. I-lart needs the football practice ﬁelds, Bemis would
like nothing better than to have his soccer team play on
grass for once, and Lewis wants a home for his baseball
team._

.|ersey’s 145 pound champ this past season. New swim-
ming coach Bill Grant earlier declared that he’s “not ac-
customed to mediocrity” and his recruiting program has
met his standards. -

 

In the top of the fourth, how-
ever, the Grads threatened to
put the game out of reach. They
rapped six hits, including triples
by Tartaglia and Ed Gabler, as
ﬁve runs crossed the plate to
give the "Grads a 7-4 advantage.
Only a sparkling defensive play
by ﬁrst baseman Bob Gropper
on a line drive over the bag pre-
vented the Grads from scoring
more. ‘

The Zeebs narrowed the deﬁ-
cit to 7-6 in their half of the
fourth. With one out, Gropper
and Neil Guberman singled, and
Art Rosengarten doubled to
right-center to drive in Gropper.
Rosenstein followed with a ﬂy-
ball to the same spot that en-
abled Guberman to tag up and
score.

The Grads added one in the
ﬁfth to tie the, score, 8-8. A triple
by Heimberg talled Gerson and
Schlesinger with the tying runs.

After holding the Grads score-
less in the sixth, the Zeebs erupt-
ed for four runs in the bottom
of the sixth to break the game
open. Guberman, Rosengarten,
and Rosenstein all singled toload
the bases with none out.

Goldstein tzhen bounced ahard
grounder to third, but the throw
to the plate Was too late to get
the streaking Guberman. Ken
Weiss, put into right ﬁeld for
defensive purposes, lashed aline
drive which was mishandled by
the centerﬁelder, that scored one
run and left the bases loaded.

game and a ground ball by

‘Pitt News’ Review

 

‘Barefoot’ In The Barn»

by ROBERT L. HOROWITZ

The Witty Neil Simon
comedy Barefoot In The
Park is the “in” thing for
summer-stock and full-time
theatre this year. It has
been playing at numerous
theatres in and around the

Pittsburgh area. It is easy to
see Why this particular play
is A having such popularity. Si-
mon’-s easy to follow plot mixed
with written-in sight gags and
humorous dialogue is an -audi-

ence drawer and, therefore, a .

summer-srtock theatre’s dream
come true. ,'

Last Friday I went out to the
White Barn in Irwn to see the'ir
production of Barefoot. This
humorous story about problems
faced by newlyweds in their
new home is done well despite
-some over acting and poor tech-
nical apparatus (the plague of
summer-stock barns and tents).

Corie (Soralie Levin) is the
scatterbrained, fun loving girl

‘married to P-aul Bratter (Don
George), a res-trained; striving
young lawyer. The play revolves
around the basic conﬂicts in
their personalities: “fun doing”
vs. “staid watching.” The con-
ﬁict spreads and soon engulfs
Corie's mother, Mrs. Banks (Hel-
‘en Wayne Rauh), a lovely, tem-
perate, hyipochondriac; and Vic-
tor Velasco (Alan Pinsker) a 58
year old epicurean of ﬁne foods
and women. Simon's handling of
this personality conﬁict is inter-
esting. He is not a Shaw or -a
Coward but his use of the con-
temprary drawing room situa-
tion .( a one-room flat) is very
good. Simon's -secret is his use
of what theatre people call t-he
“build,” i.e., starting low or slow
and getting louder or faster. The
“building" tetes-a-tetes in Bare-
fot in the Park are the soul of
the whole play: and the greatest
challenge the play offers to both
the actors and the directors.

It is in this capacity that the
White Barn Production succeeds.
The very funny face to face
scenes between the actors are

handled beautifully. It is dur-
ing these scenes that the actors
are at their best and problems
such as overacting and uncon-
trolled voice modulation are at‘
2: minimum.

Soralie Levin and Don George
seem to be involved in a who
can out shout whom competi-
tion. Miss Levin bounds around
the stage screeching her lines.
Her enthusiasm andlack of con-
trol are such that the other ac-
tors must work twice as hard
in order to reach her level. Don
George is the most guilty of her
competitors. He is on stage with
her quite often, and exaggerates
his actions to prevent Miss Lev-
in from overshadowing his per-
formance. During their “build”
scenes, however, they show signs
of working together rather than
against each other. ‘

Joe Coyle (the telephone re-
pairman) and Alan Pinsker give
delightful performances. Coyle’s
use of his huge physique is a
sight gag in itself. His role may
be small, bu-t it is exceedingly
comical. Pinsker’s portrayal has
its moments despite his unfor-
tunate tendency to get into the
Levin-George compet-ition.
