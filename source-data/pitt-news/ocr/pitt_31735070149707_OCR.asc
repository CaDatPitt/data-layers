.Internet gians go offline in protest of SOPA, PIPA

By Nate Kreichman
For The Pitt News

l‘ When freshman neuroscience ma-

jor Wasi Mohamed navigated to
Wikipedia on Wednesday to seek
information to help with his chem-
istry lab, he found a mostly black
screen instead of the site’s usual
trademark globe:

Mohamed read on the screen
that the site had blacked itself
out in protest of something called
SOPA, but he had a project to ﬁnish
and no time to read further into
the acronym,

Wikipedia, Reddit and many
other major websites went vol-
untarily dark Wednesday to raise
awareness of the proposed Stop

Online'Piracy and PROTECT IP
acts, which seek to rein in online
piracy of copyrighted material.
The sites’ blackouts were meant
to show Internet users what the
Webwould be like if theacts get
signed into law, speciﬁcally dem-
onstrating the levels of censorship
that may occur.

The two bills have, become a»
major source of controversy ‘on
the web over the past few weeks as
the House of Representatives and
Senate debated the issue.

SOPA, ﬁrst introduced in the
House on Oct. 26, would make
sweeping changes to the methods
by which companies seek to re-
move copyrighted content posted
online. Tech giants such as Google,
Yahoo, eBay and Twitter have come

out against the legislation, pitting
themselves against the entertain-
ment industry — the bills’ main
proponent — in a ﬁght that could
change the Web as we know it.
“Today, Wikipedians from
around the world have spoken
about their opposition to this de-
structive legislation,” said Wiki-
pedia founderjirnmy Wales in an
ofﬁcial ‘release on the website.
“While we regret having to pre-
vent the world from having access.

T to Wikipedia for even a second,

we simply cannot ignore the fact
that SOPA and PIPA endanger free
speech both in the United States
and abroad, and set a frightening
precedent of Internet censorship
for the world.” '

The Senate was originally set

to vote on its version of the bill,
PIPA, onjan; 18, but the vote was
pushed back untiljan. 24.

According to Politico, at least
four senators originally sponsor-
ing the bill have withdrawn their
support. '

Markup of the SOPA bill in
the House has been delayed until
February. In a statement released‘
Tuesday afternoon, Rep. Lamar
Smith,R-Texas, said the delay was
caused by a number of Republican
and D_e-mocrafretreats scheduled
over the next few weeks.

On Saturday, the Obama admin-
istration stated its opposition to
the bill in its current form, saying,
“We will not support legislation

Bus system  
braces for

steep slashes  

By Amy Friedenberger »
Assistant News Editor

-

Come September, students might
have to ﬁnd another way to get
around the citylate at night.

The Pittsburgh Port Authority
‘unveiled plans Wednesday to cut
service times, raise bus and trolley
fares and eliminate dozens of bus
routes this year in response-to a
lack of state funding.

The new plan would take effect
on Sept. 2, 2012, and lead to'th,e
elimination of 45 routes as part of
an overall 35 percent service re-
duction. The cuts would terminate
service for most routes at about

10 p.m. and eliminate 500 to .600.

jobs, according to the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette. V

~ The cuts would result in 100
municipalities and neighborhoods
having no bus service, and riders
whose routes are still running
would pay more.

The Zone 1 fare is set to rise by
25 cents to $2.50, and Zone 2 rides
will cost $3.75. ‘

The Port Authority is facing a
projected $64 million deﬁcit in its
2012'-2013 operating budget, and
the shortfall creates pressure for
it to make deep cuts.

The Port Authority cut 15 per-
cent of its services last March,
eliminating 29 routes and reduc-
ing weekly service on an additional
37 routes.

Gov. Tom Corbett will be mak-
ing his 2012-2013 budget address
byearly February, and the speech
could address the transportation
issue.

Allegheny County Executive
Rich Fitzgerald released a state-
ment on.Wednesday saying the
proposed cuts will have a “sig-
niﬁcant and profound impact”

Occupy Pittsburgh member Bob

“People rely on buses to get to

said. “But another feature is that
mass transit reduces congestion
on the roads and pollution. You
also need to remember that some
people don’_t have vehicles and
older people may not drive.”

opposition for the planned cuts.

French abassador

» By Gretchen Andersen
. A Staff Writer

In a time of ﬁscal and economic un-
certainty, France’s ambassador to
the U.S. said in a Wednesdayspeech
at Pitt, his country is counting on
the United States.

V. “We i believe in y,o'ur- caou-ntry ‘

based on the fact that you reinvent

yourselves, and I believe Pittsburgh -

is avery good example of this,” Am-
bassador Francois Delattre said.
Delattre delivered his remarks
to 150 people at the University Club
Wednesday morning as part of a

breakfast brieﬁng titled “New Op— ‘

portunities for the Franco-Ameri-
can Partnership and for the Trans-
atlantic Relationship.” His speech
focused on U.S.-French relations,
happenings in the Middle East and
the .Egropean ﬁnancial crisis.

_ The United States is the No. 1
foreign investor in France, Delattre
said. “That shows Americans have
good taste,” he joked, to ‘laughter
from the audience. F

The backbone of the Franco-

American “strategic and political

partnership” is cross-investment,
Delattre said, describing how sub-
sidiaries of French companies lo-
cally employ Pittsburghers and how
both countries employ millions of
workers globally. ' — t V
Delattre brought up ‘the Euro-

pean ﬁnancial crisis and his belief H
‘ in the strength of the euro.

“All in all, [it] has been a great
success story,” he said of the euro,
explaining how the currency helped

promote trade and investment
in Europe and with_ the United
States. /

Josephine ‘Olson, professor of
business administration and di-

rector of the International Busi-

ness Center in the Joseph M. Katz

Graduate School of Business, said L
- she isn’t sure if she agrees with

Delattre aboutthe current status

of the euro.

. “It seemed to work for a number

. of years, butwith theﬁnancial cri-

sis, the problems of the euro have
become more obvious,” Olson said
in an email. “The countries do not
coordinate their ﬁscal policies (tax-
es and spending), and the European

Central Bank is not able to act as a ‘

‘lender of last resort’ the way the
Federal Reserve or the Bank of Eng-

~ landldoes. Policies will have to be

changed for the euro to continue

. in_the,longrunV._’’ .

.7 Delattre was‘ named French am-
bassador -in February 2011, after
serving three years asambassador
of France to Canada. The ambas-
sador — who said this was his ﬁrst
trip to Pittsburgh —— was in town

for a social engagement, .organ'iz- /
fers said. The breakfast was spon-

sored by Pitt and the World Affairs
Council of Pittsburgh, a nonproﬁt,
non-partisan organization that
helps promoteethe understanding
of international issues throughout
Western Pennsylvania;

The ambassador spoke about
how France and the United States
share common interests and values,
including their joint ﬁghts on many
fronts, stfch as during World War II
and most recently in Afghanistan

 

talks U.S.

and Libya.

‘,‘Our<countries have stood side
by side ‘and shoulder-to-shoulder
to promote the values of freedom
and liberty,’_’ Delattre said. “French
relations have never been closer
than they are today.” A

Delattre outlined three of what

he _called France’s competitive as-

sets: its growing population, b'oom— .
ing -‘entrepreneurship. and recent

downsize of its government. He
also acknowledged that innova-
tion is one of the top priorities in
France.

“We found last year.- that there
were more than 650,000 new

“businesses, and that is expected a
to increase. The younger genera— ‘

tion, instead of knocking on the
government’s door, rolls its sleeves

up. ;And.it’.ll fail at ﬁrst e because A-

c’est la vie — but then it succeeds,”
D‘e,la'tl;1’€-Said. . -. .0 ‘

nese, Indians, Brazilians and other

rising powers [with our] shared .val—’ '

ues andinterests.’-’
Later thatafternoon, Delattre

expanded on the-French support for '

American intervention in Afghani-
stan and for the War on Terror. -
“We have to succeed in Afghani-
stan, of "course. Our common duty
is never will al—Qaida rule and
grow again in Afghanistan. A_ lot is

. at stake — a transition to democ-

racy. We are on the same boat,” he
said, affirming his support of U.S.
efforts. '

Delattre also brought up that
both the United States and France

are at the forefront of efforts to
promote democracyamovements

in the Arab world. In regards_ to '

Iran, Delattre said both countries

must prevent Iran from becoming -

a nuclear weapons state. 7
“A nuclear Iran would be a to-

‘ tally unacceptable thing for every

one of us,” Delattre said.

Olson described how the United‘

States is affected by the European
ﬁnancial/crisis, since the global

ﬁnancial system is highly int'e— ‘

grated.’ —
“U.S. investors hold European

- ﬁnancial assets and Europeans hold

American assets. Thus, when there
is a crisis in one -country, it affects
investors in many other countries,”
she said. . _ I «

the last couple» years has affected

In order to come out of the debt
crisis, Delattre said Europe needs to
tighten”its belt,,.impose structural
reforms to promote growth and

establish a governance to better ~
‘ regulate policies. '

During the breakfast, Chancel—.

‘ lor Mark Nordenberg said he hoped

Delattre would return to Pittsburgh
andpresented the ambassador with
a hand-forged plaque featuring the
Cathedral of'Learning. “We hope
there will be many return visits.

This is the beginning of developing h
lasting friendships and partner-

ships,” Nordenberg said.

~non’t evaluate higher  r

Many college studentsfinlsist that if

tuition rates overstate higher ed-

to one blogger, universities like

I Pitt only charge a fraction of their

market price. , i 0 t 
This Monday, Mother Jones

political analyst Kevin Drum used .
a supposed $1 million lifetime— '

income gap betweencollege
graduates and high school gradu-

‘ ates as a basis for placing the net .g

$300,000, or $75,000 per year.

Given that most‘ universities’

haveyet to demand more than
$50,000 a year, Drum predicts
tuition rates will continue to
rise, underscoring the need for
federal aid. - .

Columnist _'

By Oliver Bateman .

After watching those thrilling
Republican debates, you’ve prob-
ably found yourself wanting to
start and ﬁnish a few arguments

of your own. Whether you’re for,-

against or indifferent to a scalding-
hot topic like gay marriage, there’s
no denying thatthis is something
more than a few people are talking
about, whenever they’re not dis-
cussing the weather or becoming
completely absorbed in the fast-
paced lives of those two adorable
broke girls on the hit CBS sitcom
“2 Broke Girls.” If you

A aren’t capable of

making a compelling argument
about such issues, there’s a very
good chance that the folks who

. can will wind up getting all of the

attention, pay raises, Facebook
“likes,” Google+ +15 and comel
dance partners. v
But never fear, dear readers:
As this slate of presidential con-
tenders has demonstrated, there

are many ways to make your point.

'Let’s examine some of the most

notable ones.

1) Bullhorning it: This is prob-
ably the easiest way to ensure your
voice gets heard, since it involves

little more than raising your voice .

to a level sufficient to drown out
the voices of everyone else around

. you. And those of you who try to

limit your communications to tex-
ting and Facebook chatting needn’t
fear, because there’s an easy way to
“bullhorn it” right on the World
Wide,Web.

urfriend: Kevin Love is def the

‘best baller.

u: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
urfriend: nah dawg truth
u: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
O0 ' '

2) Indisputable facts and ﬁg-
ures: If there’s one thing that most
people usually get wrong, it’s the
facts. Since it’s very difficult to
remember anything, arguments
based on “evidence” frequently de-
volve into long—winded recitations

. Yasmine_Bleeth '

tales (“Mountain Dew causes impo-

‘ tence,” “Mountain Dew causes you

to develop an impossible—to—deﬂate
pup tent”), inaccurate sports sta-

tistics (“Barry Bonds hit 899 home .

runs in 2004”)_ and meaningless
tautologies (“That child molester
deserves the death penalty because
he should be killed for what he’s
done”). Instead‘ of w-asting pre-
cious words on a “tlgdr” rebuttal
that could be better allocated to

.the term paper you’ve been mean-

ing to semi-plagiarize for the past
few weeks, silence your opponent

by directinghim or her to the re—_ .

pository of all human knowledge.

urfriend: look man I’m telling

_ you that Yasmine Bleeth is dead

u: no way dawg

urfriend: 4 serious she is be-
cause I heard that somewhere ‘

u: http://en.wikipedia.org]wiki/

3) The appeal to authority: Sure,

one could just blindly accept Wiki-
pedia’s claim that Yasmine Bleeth

isn’t dead ——_ but what if the person _ V

you’re debating makes an appeal
to a higher and far more powerful

authority? Here’s where things .

can get murky.

urfriend: yeah but I just
prayed to some angels and the

4 sure she’s dead

urfriend: it’s in there bro

editors would like to assure read-
ers Bleeth is not dead]

4) Ad hominem = rad hominem:
Even if ‘you’re on the ropes, don’t
surrender. The person‘ you’re de-
bating might have you over a barrel
by virtue of being smarter than you
or invoking God, but he’s probably
too much of a sweetheart to retali-
ate if you’re willing to make it per-
sonal and take it personally.

Q&A

Pitt artist

ialks shifting from

barber to Ban! 

By Sarah Simkin
Senior Staff Writer

ThePitt News caught up with the Pitt the-
ater department’s teaching artist—in—resi—
dence Theo Allyn for a few questions about
her role as Phoebe in Pittsburgh Public
Theater’s production of “As You Like It,”
which opens Jan. 19 and plays until Feb. 19
atthe O’-Reilly Theater. _ I

V"'%The Pitt;’News: Tell me a little about be-
ing a teaching artist—in-residence in the Pitt
theater department.

Theo Allyn: Very good question. It is

a position that’s in flux — we’re feeling
out how best to use that particular posi-
tion. Part of ’
whatl do is
work with
the Shake-
speare—in—
the—Schoo1s’
“Lovers and
F ‘ig h t e r s ”
production
that tours to
elementary _
and middle 
Schools. I Pittsburgh Public Theater
don’t spend

a lot of

time teaching classes. That’s something
I’m looking forward to next year. Having
artists—in—residence gives theater majors a
chance to work closely with professionals
on the main—stage productions before they
head out into the world.

TPN: Pittsburgh audiences last saw you
on stage as Mrs. Lovett in Pitt Repertory
Theatre’s production of “Sweeney Todd.”
Shakespeare is a big switch.’How was pre-
paring for this role different? Is acting
Shakespeare different from interpreting
other playwrights?

TA: For Mrs. Lovett I obviously had to
do a lot of work musically. I’m not a singer
at all so there was a great deal of prepara-
tion and working with the vocal director.
Ultimately though, the preparation‘ is the
same: I read the script as many times ‘as I
can and think about what the characters
are ﬁghting for, what is getting in the way
of what they’re ﬁghting for. .The difficulty
of performing Sondheim [the composer
of “Sweeney Todd”] is not completely dis-
similar from Shakespeare in terms of really
high stakes and big language. = ’

getting them out of your drawers. Do-

really loved a particular pattern — that
might not be your best option. Thank-
fully, there’s something else you can do:
Recycle them into T—shirt bags. These‘
bags are easy to make, hold a lot of stuff
and are eco—friendly. I

TPN: What challenges does the language
present from an actor’s perspective?

TA: I don’t ﬁnd the language to be archa-
ic; I think it’s heightened. It isn’t the way we
speak today contemporarily, but it totally
supports what’s going on in the characters’
lives. Once you look up the words you’re not
sure aboutand ﬁgure ‘out: “Is this verse? Is

- it prose? Is it in rhythm? Can I break the

rhythm?” I ﬁnd the -language that much
more delightful.

TPN: Tell. me about your character,
Phoebe. ‘

TA: She is a shepherdess in the forest of
Arden. She’s rather scornful and disdainful

end everybody ends up in love with who

in the heart of the Cultural District

Theo Allyn, who last performed as Mrs. Lovett in “Sweeney Todd,” is playing Phoebe in “As You Like It."

Vere and the forest is white and a place of
freedom‘, so there’s a pretty distinct shift
from the court to the Forest of Arden. The
set and the costumes help us tell the story.
In terms ofthere being a concept, it’s very
lovely and really simple. It’s about the peo-
ple and the words and the story, not a lot
of stuff and gimmicks. Just people saying
words that they have to say.

TPN: Is Shakespeare still relevant for"

modern audiences?

.1. Jlliil lllillﬁlliiliill 7

Courtesy Pittsburgh Public Theater

 

TA: I think so, when the actors know
what they’re saying and can be really clear
about who these characters are and what
they want in their lives. Everyone has been
in love with someone they can’t have or had
a difficult encounterwith a family member
or had a best friend, and that’s all in these
plays. The language sometimes strikes us
as so foreign that we can’t wrap our heads
around it, but when actors can commit
to the task and invite the audience in, it’s
deﬁnitely still relevant. I

  Beware:S

. By Tucker Vento
WPTS Contributor

In today’s world,‘ the music you
listen to accounts for only half
of your coolness — the blog that
you get it from counts too.

Every wannabe hipster is
starting a _ music blog lately,
which means a lot of sifting for
blogosphere hunters. Of course,
there exists the gold standard of
music blogs: Pitchfork, Gorilla
vs. Bear, even Stereogum — but
can you rely on them anymore?
The music‘blog industry is suffer-
ing from burnt-out middle-aged
men who no longer understand

’ the concept of relevancy and hip

angst. ~
Pitchfork Media — p4k, for
the tweeters out there —‘ was

founded in 1995, which is a mil-
lennium ago in buzz-years. How
has it remained relevant to the
indie community over the span of
almost 20 years? Well, it hasn’t.

age 35-year-old and my mother: They grew
up with the same indieand alt feelings that
we have now. _ It’s just that, lately, they’ve
been a little preoccupied with that whole
“money” thing, and they’ve realized that a
good review on their website can make or
break an album. If Pitchfork can tap back
into their early twenties and rediscover the
indie that still dwells inside, we could see a
resurrection of the buzzworld in 2012.

A . ‘ 'It’s looking good, too: Pitchfork has‘

acquired the ‘hipster-acclaimed blog Al-
tered Zones (R.I.P.) as a regular column
on its website, and many of its other fea-
tured articles do a good job of promoting
content that you can’t ﬁnd in other places.

_ ‘The problem is, taking advantage of that

worthwhile content requires some sifting
— on a site that used to exist so that you
wouldn’t have to sift.

If things don’t change, we might Wit-
ness what can only be called a buzzpoca-
lypse, and the relevant content of Pitchfork
will be buried under irrelevant reviews of
soon-to-be Billboard chart toppers. If you
wake up one morning and Kanye West is
descending from the sky ﬂanked by Zooey

Deschanel‘ and Lana Del Rey, you’ll know
it-’s happening. If Pitchfork continues its

current trend, we could see this buzipoca— '

lypse happening as soon‘ as next fall. A
revolution will occur, and new blogs will be
thrust to the forefront as indie readers de-
mand fresh content. Pitchfork has given up
on trying to ﬁnd anything new, and is only
telling us about things we already know
and enjoy. Want to survive the revolt? Clip
this out and save it. You just might need it.
It is our job, as educated concertgoers
and relevant MP3 sharers, to .maintain
this demand and not grow complacent
with the same old releases. While it will be
scary at ﬁrst, start branching out from the
Pitchfork intravenous feed, and check out

the blogs listed here.‘ Or take a look at the ~

, Hype Machine —- hypem.com —— for an ag-
gregate of the most popular MP3s gathered
from hundreds of up—and—coming blogs.
This way, the seemingly inevitable fall of
Pitchfork will-be much less painful for you.

V Who knows? Its writers could always re-
discover themselves as the indie demigods
they once were. But for most, selling out is
a one-way street. . -

Staﬁ” Writer

The Pitt Division I club hockey
team lost six forwards to gradu-
ation last year —- including its
all—time leading scorer — and

' earned no votes in the preseason

top—25 poll.

With a new coaching staff tak-
ing over and a roster ﬁlled with
seven freshmen and just three
seniors, few people expected the
Panthers to make an impact on
club hockey this season.

But now the Panthers (16-5-2)
are ranked No. 22 in the nation
and are in position to qualify

for the national championship‘
, bracket. After a loss to West Vir-
ginia on Monday night —' the.

Panthers went 1-1. against their
rival this season — Pittnis now
second in the division standings
behind John Carroll University.

In order to qualify for a bid to .

nationals, Pitt needs to win the
division title or move inside the
top-20 mark nationally.
Forward Robert McDyre might
be the key to that success.
McDyre — one of the squad’s
three seniors — ' is averaging

 SPORTS 

nearlyone goal and one assist per
game. ‘ .

“He always makes a play when
needed and will be a strong player
for us in the next couple weeks,”
freshman forward Matt Johnson
said.

McDyre has 40 points through
22 games this season, including
four game-winning goals, and
he has become a - leader for the
younger athletes.

“He is a good leader on and
off the ice,” freshman Brian Stein
said. “We sometimes need to
rely on him to create offense and
score a goal.”

Led by ﬁrst-year coach Stu
Rulnick, Pitt Division 1 club hock-

. ey_ plays in the College Hockey

Mid-America Conference of the

- American Collegiate Hockey As—

sociation. _

Club sports teams compete
with teams from other univer-
sities, but their athletes aren’t
on athletic scholarships and the
teams aren’t governed by the
NCAA. ' _

Rulnick arrived at Pitt after
serving as an assistant coach.at
Duquesne. He took the job as the
Panthers’ head coach after Tom
Rieck stepped down from the po-

‘\

sition after eight years, . I

, As a new head coach facing the
loss of key veteran ‘players, Rul-
nick focused on giving his young
squad strong leadership.

“He does ‘a good job at getting

Atlanta move to Winnipeg spurs divisional realignment"

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

About 1,300 miles —— that’s how
far the Winnipeg Jets have to
travel to play a National Hockey

. League Southeast divisional game

against the Washington Capitals.

The Jets, previously based in At—'

lanta and known as the Thrashers
before this season, have thrown a
wrench in the NHL’s division for-
mat. _

In order to create a more bal-
anced travel format for all teams
while attempting to maintain ri-
valries, ESPN reported that NHL
Commissioner Gary Bettman and
the league’s Board of Governors
have agreed to implement a dras-
tic change. '

Four conferences — yet to be
named -— will replacethe two-
conference, six-division align-
ment already in place. Every team
will be guaranteed a home-and-

» home series with every noncon-
' ference team in the‘ league and

ﬁve or six against every_ confer-
ence foe.

‘But this isn’t the ﬁrst time the
NHL, or its teams, have switched
it up.

The capital of ‘Georgia and
hockey just don’t seem to get
along. Atlanta is now the only city
in the modern era to have an NHL
team relocate on it twice, and the
city constantly "causes the league
a headache.

In 1980, just eight years after
debuting, the Atlanta Flames —
whose name harkened back to the

burning of Atlanta by U.S. Army J

General William Sherman during
the Civil War —- went north for (_a
little longer than) the winter and
settled in Calgary. .

The NHL has _a relocation and

’ expansion history that many cur-

rent fans know nothing about.
For example,- how many of you
knew that the New Jersey Devils

franchise is currently in its third _

city?

There are many ignorant fans-

out there that had no idea that the
Devils started as the Kansas City
Scouts in 1974 before moving af-
ter just two horrendous years to
Colorado, where they became the
Rockies.

After six equally bad years in
Colorado, they jumped‘ cross-

country to New Jersey in 1982,

pact on the Pitt’s squad. Bass has
nearly '25 years experience as a
hockey coach and Hestin was the
4Mid—America Coach of the Year at
IUP. ' «
Bass said the success this sea-
son has been the result of a team
effort — and that includes Pitt’s
defense. Pitt has only allowed '52
%goals this _season, which is the
fourth—best in all of the ACHA. _
“Our defense . and goaltend-

, ing have been outstanding,” Bass

said. “These guys really over-
achieved this season”

Bass .said sophomore goalie

where they’ve been ever since.

i That started a trend in the
1990s in-which teams left less-
populated but hockey-rich areas
in search of bigger markets. In
1993, the Minnesota North Stars
went south after 26 years .— and

ances — and landed in Dallas.

Behling had a .94 save'.per-

and has carried that success to

starting, he has a .91 save per-

“He -keeps us in the game and

son said. “We always _ feel‘ real

Lakers, Bryant look to     .
make title run post-lockout

Nate Barnes
Staﬁ"—Writer

For the duration of the lengthened lockout
offseason, NBA reporters around the nation
found themselves hard—pressed to come up
with news to reporton the league.

Excepting ESPN.c’orn’s rankings of the
league’s top 500 ‘players and NBA Draft
news injune, fresh content was rare.

As a result, fans of the basketball

by association became subjected to sports-

media-outlet stories that dealt primarily
with the most recognizable faces of the
league. Eventually, much of the discourse

,,focused on the seemingly’. inevitable.

demise of the Los Angeles Lakers and their
superstar guard Kobe Bryant.
After being swept in the NBA Playoff

' semiﬁnals by the eventual champions, the _
Dallas Mavericks, the Lakers appeared to .
. be heading into a tailspin that would lead to

a season filled with losing and strife in the
. realm. of Los Angelesbasketball. Questions

ran , wild‘ regarding how the team would

perform in the next season. .

‘ Phil Jackson, the greatest coach in the '

history of the'league, ‘took his eight NBA
Championship rings and rode off into the

' Montana sunset he holds so dear. New
coach Mike Brown became the sheriff in
the City of Angels. _ ’
The team supposedly only ﬁelded three
‘quality players. They had no depth. Kobe
Bryant; after what was arguably" his worst

season since "his rookie year, seemed to be

heading toward the end of his career. Many
‘ wondered whether other players were

~ entering the dusk of their careers as well.’  _

_ ' After the loss to Dallas, Hall of Famer
Earvin “Magic”_]ohnson, who won ﬁve NBA
;{:'Championships with Los Angeles during

lits “Showtime” days, called. for drastic ,

changes to the roster. He went so far as to
say that the teamshould be “blown up” in
the l’0ﬁ'Season:’ .  -. ~ ' 2 “

— “The Lakers" have two problerifst they’re a ‘

too’ slow andi',l-they have no If athletes,”
Johnson said to ESPN; in May. “This is an
V athletic league now. When you think about
all the teams that are in the playoffs right
. now, they all can run fast and jump high.”
But now, eight months later, the Lakers
sit at 10-5. Bryant ‘is leading the league in
- scoring. Los Angeles defends the basket
with the best of any team in the NBA and
it’s leading a division that many thought
the Clippers —— after pairing their exciting
young superstar Blake Grifﬁn with an_ even
more exciting young superstar, Chris Paul
— would dominate.
And despite ]ohnson’s ﬁgurative call to
arms, the roster of the Los“Angeles Lakers
remains nearly the -same as it was in May.

The only notable change was the departure
of Lamar Odom, who expressed discontent
after the much—publicized trade for then-
New Orleans Hornets point guard Chris

Paul fell through when NBA Commissioner '

David Stern nixed the deal. Days later, Los
Angeles traded Odom to the Mavericks

in exchange for a trade exception of $8.9 ’

million, indicating at the time that more

transactions lay waiting. .
Speculation abounded about Whether

the Lakers would attempt a trade for

disgruntled Orlando Magic center Dwight '

Howard ‘or other players. Instead, the
Lakers ﬁlled out their rotation_ with
forwardsTroyMurphyand]oshMcRoberts.
Both players addressed an-issue prevalent
in the previous roster: the lack of a deep

bench. . - 4 y ,
McRoberts, a former Duke star, and

Murphy, who averaged a double—double
during his_tenure with the Indiana Pacers,
provide the hustle and rebounds missing
from last year’s team. The efforts of both
players cannot be undervalued and have
helped Los Angeles become the league’s
top rebounding team, averaging 45.6 a
game. ' . " ‘

The resurgences of Matt Barnes
and Steve Blake, players signed before
last season, also play a large part in the
newfound _depth of _a supposedly weak
Lakers team. Under Jackson, these, players

found the concepts of the coach’s famed.
' triangle "offense difﬁcult to grasp.

Along with the artist formerly known

’ as Ron Artest (now'Metta World Peace),

these players thrive in Brown’s ‘new
system. }5In addition to new signee and

3-point marksmanjason Kapono, who won
f back—to-back NBA 7If_hree—Point Shootout

crowns at the 2007 and 2008 NBA All-Star
Weekends, Brown has ﬁve bench players
who provide quality minutes, a rare luxury
for NBA coaches.

Head coach Mike Brown has silenced

 nearly all critics regarding the quality of
‘team he would produce this season, guiding

the Lakersto a rank of third in the Western-
Conference. Besides that, the Lakers rank

ﬁfth in the league in scoring defense, only’
allowing 89.4 points to their opposition -

on a nightly b,asis.,With the body of work
Brown put together during his tenure] in
Cleveland — a tenure during which he was
one of the NBA’s most winning c_oa_ches 4
it should come as no surprise to anyone
that the focus of this Lakers team is on
defense._ I - , -
As for the questions of age: ‘Well, I
believe we all know what Bryant spent his
extended summer doing-—workingharder
than anyone else. All the criticisms of his

ers moved to Raleigh, N.C., and became the
Carolina Hurricanes. « -
The last time the NHL needed to tweak
its divisions came in 1999, when the
Thrashers entered the league as an expan-
sion team along with Minnesota’s second
chance, the» Wild. The NHL then moved

~ from four divisions —— Smythe, Norris,

Adams and Patrick — to the six geographi-

_ cally named ones we see today.

But with the NHL’s reported plan, the
current divisions will soon fall by the way-
side as well. A i

The Eastern time zone will contain two
seven—team conferences. Boston, Buffalo,

'’ Florida, Montreal, Ottawa, Tampa Bay and

Toronto will make up one, and Carolina,
New Jersey, both New _York teams, Phila-
delphia, Pittsburgh and Washington will
form the other.

will contain the Central time zone teams of
Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Detroit, Min-
nesota, Nashville, St. Louis and Winnipeg.
The problem with this realignment ap-
pears at playoff time. The top four teams
in each conference will make the playoffs,
and the ﬁrst two rounds will be used to de-
termine the champion of each respective
