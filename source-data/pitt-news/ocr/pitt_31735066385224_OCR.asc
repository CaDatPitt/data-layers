Potential  
violence

By Brendan Kevenides

Staff Writer -

Last week Pitt's New Student
Network, along with other col-

glege organizations across the

country, made plans to counter-

a demonstrate at the ”White Pow-

er Day” demonstration sched-
uled for November 5 in

I Philadelphia.

However, due to its potential

for violence, the white suprema-
‘ cists’ demonstration has been

canceled.
Scheduled to appear at the

II-demonstration were the Ku Klux.

Klan, the United States League of
White Christian Patriots, the Skin-
heads, the White Aryan
Resistance Movement and at least
15 other white supremacist or-
ganizations, according to the As-
sociated Press.
Counter-protesters scheduled
to attend the rally, included Stu-
dents and Youth Against Racism,
an affiliate of the All People's

I Congress, and the New Student

Network, a University of Pitts-
burgh human rights organization,

"I don't want to restrict the
Klan’s freedom of speech, but I
think it's important to counter-
demonstrate,” said Angie Hirsh,
NSN business manager and form-
er president.

The decision to cancel ”White
Power Day” came after lengthy
discussions between representa-
tives from the National Park Serv-
ice, the Philadelphia police and
the Klan.

The announcement came on
Wednesday from Philadelphia
Park Superintendent Hobart Ca-
wood, who said that the demon-
stration was canceled due to

By Lou Grieco »-

The Pitt News

Sen. Paul Simon (D-|II.), speak-

ing of the narrow presidential vic— ’

tories of Harry S. Truman and
John F. Kennedy, urged students
to vote for Gov. Michael Dukakis
last night at Carnegie Mellon
University.

”Forget the polls,” Simon said.

— ”We are in a state that is vital. If

you can't carry Pennsylvania and
Illinois, you're not going to do it.”

Simon said that during his race
for the Senate, ‘polls showed him
behind by double-digit figures,
but he won the election. He said
that the presidential race is still
close, and.Dukakis could win.

”Non—issues seem to dominate
this election,” Simon said. ”The
confusion with the Pledge of Al-
legiance and furlough issues has
caused peopleto lose sight of the
issues.”

Simon said that the issues he
feels are most important are edu-
cation, jobs, the environment, the
quality of judicial appointments
and the arms race.

”Government is not the en-

emy, it is a tool,” Simon saidin

response to Vice President Bush's
charges that the government
should not interfere with the at-
fairs of private citizens.

Simon said that though Bush
wants to be the ”education presi-
dent,” his record in the House of
Representatives shows no sup-
port for education. Simon served
on the House Education Sub-
committee for 10 years, and is
presently A on the Senate sub-
committee. A

Simon called Bush's attacks on
Dukakis’ record ”distorted." He
named Presidents Lincoln, Tru-

The crowd circled the building,
chanting, ”cast out the demons,”
and ”no more war.” The pro-
testers carried torches, played
tambourines and beat on drums
to attract attention to the parade.

Carnegie Mellon was chosen as
the site for the protest because 70
percent, of CMU’s research is

that there are people who care.
If people don't stand up for their
beliefs, things like this will keep
going on. We have-to get the apa-

MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) —

‘The lone operating reactor at

Three Mile Island made an
unscheduled shutdown on Sun-
day morning for reasons believed
to have originated in the plant's
non-nuclear turbine system, a
spokesman said.

News BRIEFS

The Unit 1 reactor shut down
automatically at 8:50 a.m. Sun-
day, said Gordon Tomb, a
spokesman for the plant operator,
CPU Nuclear Corp.

Plant systems operated normal-
ly during the shutdown and no
emergency condition existed, he
said. - ,

The federal Nuclear Regulato-
ry Commission was notified,
Tomb said. Plant and agency offl-
cials were checking the system

‘ Sunday afternoon to'try to deter-

mine the cause of the shutdown,
he said.

E At the time of the shutdown,
-the reactor was operating at full
power, generating about 880
megawatts of electricity, Tomb

said.

Three Mile Island was the site
of the nation's worst commercial
nuclear accident on March 28,
1979, when equipment failures
and human error led to a_ loss of

coolant and partial core. melt-'

down in the plant's Unit 2
reactor.

The NRC approved the restart
of the undamaged Unit 1 reactor
on May 30, 1985.

Kraft agrees to Philip

Morris buy-out terms

NEW YORK (AP) —— Kraft Inc.
said on Sunday it had agreed to
a $13.1 billion buy-out by Philip
Morris Cos. Inc'., ending a short
but intense takeover fight in the
biggest merger ever between two
non—oil U.S. companies. E

In a joint statement, the two
food giants said they reached a
definitive agreement in which
Philip Morris would pay $106
cash for each of Kraft’s outstand-
ing shares.

Kraft shares closed at $96.50,

up $2 a share, Friday on the New 8

York Stock Exchange. Philip Mor-
ris closed ' down 25 cents at

$94.75 a share.

The agreement comes just five
days after Kraft, which is based in
Glenview, I|l., said it would
negotiate with Philip Morris only
if the tobacco and consumer
products company raised its ini-
tial $90 a share buy-out offer to
equal the value of a defensive re-
structuring proposed by Kraft.

Stanford racial

un rest not isolated
STANFORD, Calif. (AP) ~— The

president of Stanford's Black Stu- —

dent Union spoke calmly, con-
trolling her anger in the tumult of
a protest against racism on
campus.

There's a dangerous link, she
said, between racist terms
scrawled on posters at Stanford,
racial slurs at Smith College and
a ”ghetto party” at DePauw.

”These aren't isolated inci-
dents,” said Mary Dillard. ”And
it's happening at Cornell, Penn-
sylvania, Harvard and Yale.
There's something wrong with
the best and the brightest.”

Officials of the nation's top
universities are trying to figure
out what is wrong and how to fix
it, but the results so far have been
disappointing.

add resses
state

_educaﬂon

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

Thomas K. Gilhool, Pennsylva-
nia’s secretary of education, an-
nounced on Thursday that the
Casey administration plans to
continually increase financial
support for the state's public
universities.

Gilhool delivered a speech, fol-

lowed by a question—and-answer '

period, at the University of Pitts-
burgh on Thursday.

A recent listing by the Nation-
al Education Association ranks
Pennsylvania last in the amount
of state dollars allocated for
higher education on a per—student
basis.

”We were immersed in a lega-
cy of neglect, but we have taken
steps to overcome that legacy,”
said Gilhool.

Gilhool explained that be-
tween 1976 and 1986, Pennsyl-
vania had dropped from the low
30s to 50th among the states in
supporting its state institutions of
higher learning. .

Gilhool said that this year
however, 68 cents of every state
tax dollar has been dedicated to
education -— an amount he called
”a historically unique per-
centage.”

This year's education budget is

~ up 7.8 percent over, last year, he

said.

”This will not offset Reagan's
overall 26 percent cut in federal
aid to education. My expectation
is that a Bush victory will further
compound these problems," Gil-
hool said.

Secretary Gilhool addressed
numerous other issues, including
one raised by several mothers of
handicapped children in atten-
dance. Should a physically or
mentally handicapped child be
taught in the same classrooms as
those childreniwho are not han-
dicapped?

’’I believe the Congress was
correct when it said that han-
dicapped children should be edu-
cated with children who aren't

handicapped,” Gilhool said. ”It~

is not surprising to me that there
is some unrest over the main-
streaming of disabled peop]e be-
cause many of us were brought
up that way,” he said.

.He asked all school district su-
perintendents at the meeting to
utilize new state-of—the—art educa-
tional techniques when teaching
disabled children in the future.

”My instinct is to tell school
districts, ’You’ve got a year to
integrate or you will suffer the
loss of federal funds,’ ” Gilhool
said.

Gilhool claimed that the
American people are very clear in
their desire for ’’accountability in
education.

”Peop|e knowing of the perfor-
mance of their schools can take
the schools where they desire
them to be.

”We must improve teaching
and learning so that no child is
left behind,” Gilhool said.

The artistic talents of disa-
bled people from across the
United States and Europe are
on display at the 1988 Har-
marville International.

This year's art exhibit in-
cludes 180 works of art by 84
artists. The purpose of the
show, according to publicity
chairwoman Myra Landau, is
to ”encourage independence
as well as to gain recognition

for outstanding artistic accom-

Works of disabled artists exhibited

plishment.”

Landau, who has been in-
volved with Harmarville for
two years, is proud of the art
show. She said it is ”very im-
pressive, and something
special.”

A catalog describing the ar-
tists and their disabilities is
available at the exhibit.
However, Landau said that
viewers are ”looking at [the ar-
tists’] ability, not their disa-
bility."

The 1988 Harmarville Inter-
national is sponsored by the

Harmarville Rehabilitation
Center and has been juried by
three distinguished people in
the field of art. The jurors are
Herbert Olds, a professor of
drawing at Carnegie Mellon
University, Carol Siegal of
Gallery C, and Thaddeus
Mosley.

The exhibit opened on Oct.
27 and will be open to the
public everyday until Nov. 18
from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on
weekdays, and noon until 4
p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.

THE PITT NEWS

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

The Penn State Lady Lions
scored a decisive victory over
the Lady Panthers in round
one of volleyball’s battle for
beast of the east.

Before an enthusiastic
crowd of 1,500 at Fitzgerald
Field House on Saturday even-
ing, Pitt was unceremonious-
ly defeated in three straight
games by the score of 15-7,
15-2 and 15-6.

The Lady Panthers led 4-2 in
the first game before Penn
State caught fire. The Lady
Lions scored five straight
points before Pitt could side-
out, but the momentum had
shifted. Aided by poor passing
on the part of the Lady Pan-
thers, Penn State won the first
game going away.

ous ball—handling errors, the
Lady Panthers were unable to
muster much of an offense,
while Penn State’s offense ran
efficiently, making easy work
of Pitt.

The Lady Panthers’ frustra-
tion continued in game three.
Penn State jumped off to a 3-0
lead before a Denise,Frawley
kill and a Michele Adamson
block narrowed the visitors’
lead to 3-2.

At that point, the Lady Lions
reeled in ‘six’‘ of the next seven
points to extend their lead to

Pitt's woes continued in j
game two. Plagued by numer-

9—3 and went on to close out
their sweep.

The Penn State squad had
numerous standouts in con-
necting on 60 percent of their
kill attempts for the evening.

Noelle Zientara converted
on nine of 10 kill attempts, as
well as notching a pair of aces.

Elizabeth Ramirez registered
nine kills and had a couple of
blocks at the net.

JoAnn Elwell had eight kills,
two blocks and served up
three aces.

For the Lady Panthers, it was
an exasperating evening. They
struggled in all aspects of the
game while Penn State
romped. '

”We are a lot better than
what we showed. Arizona was
in the nation
when we beat them a couple
of weeks back. We certainly
did not play as well as we
have before,” noted dejected
Pitt coach Shelton Collier.

The post game statistics do
nothing to refute the coach's
assessment.

While the Lady Lions
seemed to hit at will against
the Lady Panthers at times, Pitt
was only able to hit at a 42
percent clip against their
rivals.

Even more indicative of the
match were the statistics con-
cerning ball-handling.

The Lady Panthers suffered

Akeem ”The Dream” Olajuwon leaps above the rim to block one of the Sixers outside shots.

 

Barkley and Olajuwon i
hope to lead teams to
'89 NBA Championship

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

Charles Barkley of the Philadel-
phia 76ers and Akeem Olajuwon
of the Houston Rockets are two
similar players. Both are consi-
dered members of the upper
echelon of the National Basket-
ball Association. Both are terrors
around the boards, and both
make well over a million dollars
a year.

That is where the similarities
stop, though. Barkley is an out-
spoken player and very wild on
and off the court, while Olaju-
won is a quiet player on and off
the court.

These two philosophies met
head—on at the Civic Arena this
past Saturday night in the second
game of the second annual
Cameron Coca—Cola NBA
Challenge. The Sixers used a big
comeback in the fourth quarter,
spearheaded by Barkley, to beat
the Rockets, 122-119.

”We were kind of flat in the be-
ginning,” Sixers coach Jim Lynam
said. ”But it was a nice comeback
in the end. It is good to come out
of this game with a win.”

As much as Barkley’s inspired
play and 24 second-half points
led to the win, it was helped

along with Olajuwon’s fouling
out with eight minutes left.

”The fouls definitely hurt us,”
Rockets coach Don Chaney said.
”When Akeem left, you could
see they [the Sixers] were in-
spired.”

Barkley has been considered
the ”bad boy” of the NBA ever
since he passed up his final year
at Auburn University to try his
luck in the pros. He has been
known to taunt opposing players
and fans. Yet, he got the loudest
cheers from Pittsburgh fans when
his name was announced.

”First of all, I don't worry about
the fans,” Barkley said. ’’I mean,

I'm going to be Charles, and if the H

people don't like it, I don't wor-
ry about it.”

Barkley, 6—foot-6 and 253
pounds, has always been a tough
competitor, but last season was a
little trying for him. The Sixers
suffered through a disappointing
36-46 season and finished fourth
in the Atlantic Division.

They have made a few key ac-
quisitions this year to help reme-
dy that situation. The Sixers got
much-needed outside shooting
help in Bradley’s Hersey
Hawkins and picked up forward
Ron Anderson to help off the

Panther soccer team defeats Villanova 1-0

By Eric Wassel

For The Pitt News

For much of the 1988 fall soc-
cer campaign, the goalkeeper po-
sition for the Pitt- soccer team has
been filled by a revolving door of
players.

Mark Hendricks, Tim Sable-
man and Jay Kapusta have all
shared duties with moderate suc-
cess. Following Saturday’s 1-0
victory over Big East foe Villano-
va, it seems Kapusta has put a
lock on the spot. Kapusta record-
ed his second consecutive
shutout as the Panthers improved
to 6-7-1. ~

Much of Kapusta’s success can
be attributed to strong defensive
performances. The defense has
allowed the sophomore goal-
keeper to face a limited number
of shots and has made his work
seem routine.

”The defense has played well
and has made it easy for me. I
really have not had to work too
hard,” Kapusta said.

Unfortunately, the offense has
had difficulty scoring goals. This
problem has been exploited in
several one-goal losses. Against
Villanova, the Pitt offense strug-
gled again, forcing the defense to
keep them in the game. Kapusta
and the defense came through,

and Marc Mostinckx scored Pitt's ‘

lone goal late in the second half,
accounting for the winning

‘ margin.

Mostinckx scored on a feed
from Ivan Amayo with just under

seven minutes remaining.

‘ ”lvan’s hustle and determina-
tion made the play happen, and
Marc finished the chance very

well,” Coach Joe Luxbacher com-

mented.

Both teams were sluggish in the
opening half as neither could ap-
ply substantial offensive pressure.
Ball control was nonexistent and
play was sloppy.

”We didn't control and pass ef-
fectively," Luxbacher said, ”and
we missed on the chances we
had.”

'Offensively, the game opened

up late in the half, primarily in the
Villanova end. But the Panthers
failed to cash in and went into the
intermission with the game
scoreless.

Midway through the second
half, Pitt began to apply pressure.
Shots by Amayo, Mike Blatz, Sam
Lanza and Scott Armstrong were
turned away. The possibility of
another one-goal defeat was
lurking.

lt looked as if the game was
headed for overtime when
Mostinckx buried the pass from
Amayo in the top corner.

,Steelers lose to Jets for first time in history

By Barry Wilner

AP Sports Writer

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -
John Booty didn't want to hear
about any losing streaks. He was
too busy helping win a game for
the New York Jets.

”We knew the Jets hadn't ever
beaten them,” Booty said on Sun-
day after his blocked punt, inter-
ception, fumble recovery and six
tackles helped New York defeat
the Pittsburgh Steelers for the first
time ever, 24-20. ”But the young
guys on this team didn't play in
those losses. We were aware of
the problems."

Theylsolved them with some
big plays. Booty’s blocked punt
set up Freeman McNeiI's clinch-
ing 5-yard touchdown run as
New York, 5-3-1, ended a nine-
game losing streak against the
Steelers, 2-7. The rookie’s fourth-
quarter play punctuated how well
the Jets’ special teams have per-
formed under assistant coach Lar-
ry Pasquale.

' ”Larry said ifl had a chance to
block it, to go ahead and do it,”
said Booty, a backup cornerback
who was a 10th-round draftee
from Texas Christian. ”We didn't
have a block on, but I went in

yourself and your team. Today,
the Jets felt they could beat the
Steelers, and we didn't back
down.” .

New York had taken a 17-10
lead thanks to three Steelers mis-
takes. Rod Woodson fumbled a
punt in attempting a fair catch,
and the Jets recovered on the
New York 48. Lupe Sanchez ran
into Jets punter Joe Prokop six
plays later and, with fourth-and-
four at the Pittsburgh 33 and
Prokop temporarily unable to
kick, O'Brien threw into the end
zone for Wesley Walker.
Dwayne Woodruff ran into Walk-
er, drawing an interference call.

Johnny Hector then scored
from the 2.

Gary Anderson brought the
Steelers within 17-13 with a
21-yard field goal 3:04 into the fi-
nal period. Earnest Jackson's

17-yard run provided the Steel-
ers’ last score.

It was the first game played at
Giants Stadium since the Jets lost
to_ Buffalo on Oct. 17. That Mon-
day night game was marred by
fights in the stands and several
small fires in the seats, leading to
curtailed beer sales and heavier
security. There were no incidents
on Sunday.

The Jets moved smartly on the
first possession of the game, even
making 13 yards on a fake punt
run by Nuu Faaola. But they gam-
bled on fourth-and-four from the
Pittsburgh 24 and had a touch-
down pass negated by an in-the-
grasp call. O'Brien twirled away

from one rusher and threw to’

wide-open Billy Griggs, who
eased into the end zone. But the
officials ruled that Tim Johnson
had his arms around O’Brien’s

legs.

The Steelers then used a
60-yard pass from Bubby Brister
to Troy Johnson on third—and-18
to set up Anderson's 26-yard field
goal.

Pittsburgh took a 10-0 lead
with 23 seconds to go in the
opening period when Brister
found Rodney Carter behind dou-
ble coverage for a 24-yard
touchdown.

O'Brien passes of 10 and 14
yards to Griggs and a 26-yarder
to Al Toon led to Pat Leahy’s
41-yard field goal in the second
period. On Pittsburgh's next play,
Hoge fumbled a swing pass and
Cole recovered at the Pittsburgh
26. -

Griggs caught an 1 1-yard pass,
Toon took a 10-yarder to the 2
and O’Brien then connected with
Mickey Shuler in the back of the

  
     
   
     

 
 

end zone to tie it. It was Shuler’s
first touchdown this year.

Anderson kicked his 193rd
consecutive extra point, the lon-
gest current streak in the league.

Safety Erik McMillan set a team
rookie record with his seventh in-
terception, tops in the league.
McMillan picked off Brister’s pass
at the New York 5 after Wesley
Walker's fumble had turned it
over at the Jets’ 25.

McMillan also dropped an in-
terception just before Carter's
touchdown reception. McMillan
had a clear field in front of him.

Pittsburgh lost defensive end
Tim Johnson to a sprained back,
while New York tight end K.D.
Dunn sprained his ankle.

The Jets were missing lineback-
er Alex Gordon, cornerback

James Hasty and guard Dan Alex-
ander, all starters.

Lady Panthers can learn from
the experience.

”We can be disappointed,
but we have next Friday night
to get back at Penn State. I
hope we are hungry enough to
beat them at State College. If
we can channel the disap-
pointment, we have a good
chance to even the score,”
said Collier.

With the loss, the Lady Pan-
thers’ record drops to 15-6,
while the 20th—ranked Penn
State squad leaves town with
a 25-1 record and their nation-

’’I think we are going to have_

had a great preseason, and I think
we are starting to play well. I'm
really looking forward to the
season.” '

Lynam isn't suprised by what
Barkley says or does anymore.

”Sometimes he shocks me a lit-

player, and great players do
different things.”

Rockets were able to go up by 15
points at the end of the third
quarter. He was a terror inside
and controlled both offense and
defense.

”Akeem is the catalyst on our
club,’’ Chaney said. ”He makes
our team go.”

Olajuwon, 7 foot and 252
pounds, has blossomed into the
most dominant center in the
league after four years, but hasn't
let it go to his head. _

’’I just want to play to the best
of my ability and help the team,”
Olajuwon said.

The Rockets’ star has also been
mired in controversy. Last season
he feuded with several team-
mates both during the season and
afterward. Then, this past sum-
mer, he said he would leave
Houston to play in Italy if his con-
tract was not renegotiated. That
is all behind him now, and he is
ready for the season.

’’I am ready now,” Olajuwon
said. ”The games start to count,
and I am ready for them.”

He has only one goal in mind
for the Rockets and feels that it
can be accomplished.

”To win a championship,”
Olajuwon said. ”My goal is al-
ways to win a championship. I
think we are going to have a great
year. l am very happy with the
direction this team is heading in
and I think we can do it.”

Barkley and Olajuwon are the
leaders of their respective teams,
and their year will be the deter-
mining factor in how well the
teams do. "
