Police preparing for

Super Bowl bonanza

b_y_L_ori Stover
Sl1z_/_/ W/ritcr

With the Steelers in the Super
Bowl, students can almost expect
trouble on Sunday. But whatever
happens, the police have a plan.

The Pitt police met with state,
county and city police last Thurs-
day to coordinate resources and
make a plan for Super Bowl Sun-
day, Pitt police chief Tim Delaney
said.

The police plan is to follow basi-
cally the same template as they did
for the last Steelers Super Bowl in
2006, he said.

“Pittsburgh has the beneﬁt of a
recent Super Bowl,” he said.

Delaney said the policewould

 

make some minor changes to the
plan, but he would not release spe-
ciﬁcs.

‘ He said the police plan to fo-
cus their forces on the South Side,
Oakland and the North Side and
use barricades.

They have asked the fire depart-
ment to be prepared to respond,
he said.

“We have to prepare for the

.worst,” said Delaney.

When the Steelers won the Su-
per Bowl four years ago, the police
ran out of fire extinguishers and
had to call the ﬁre department for

' reinforcement.

“It’s getting more intense,” he
said. “They try to outdo each oth-
er each time.”

Hemingway’s Cafe has been one
of the most popular bars in Oakland
for Steelers games all season, but
don’t expect owner john Glavsky to
keep its doors open for Super Bowl
Sunday.

‘Tm  to go to Florida,” he
said.

W/ith the exception of Heming-

Oakland businesses will be open for
customers who want to watch the
game and celebrate afterward.

Ambulances a concern
for riot controlteams

Bonanza, page 2

After the last Super Bowl, students in
Oakland overturned two to three vehicles
and stuffed the gas tank of one vehicle with
terrible. towels and lit them on ﬁre, said
Delaney. Police put out the fire before any
destruction" could occur.

Other students also lit a couch on“ ﬁre
and then tried to sit on it, he said. Ofﬁcers
immediately pulled the students off the
couch.

Delaney said the police will cite and arrest
students for underage drinking, disorderly
conduct and any other applicable charges,
but they -won’t have enough officers to at-
rest everyone. _

Police will also attempt to stop anyone
who tries to overturn vehicles, he said, but
this opens up the chance of a car overturn-
ing onto an officer or other person.

If the police apprehend people destroy-
ing property, those people must pay for the

property damage as part of their punish-

ment. Otherwise, the owner of the property
can ﬁle an insurance claim.

In any celebration, the police must make
sure that ambulances and buses can still get
through the street, he said.

“There are people-who don’t care about
football,” said Delaney

Recently, thepolice have noticed an inﬂux
of students from other universities partici-
pating in these celebrations, Delaney said.

In terms of how long the celebrations
last, Delaney said the police try to give
people time to celebrate, but sometimes the
weather does the work for them.

When the Steelers won the AFC cham-
pionship  18, police decided to give the
crowd ‘until midnight before they broke it
up, but facing cold temperatures, the crowd
left shortly before midnight, Delaney said.

As advice to those celebrating, “Enjoy
yourselves, but don’t go over the line,” said
Delaney.

Oakland establishments to
beef up security on Sunday

Businesses, page 2

Primanti Brothers bought a new surround
sound system and ﬂat screen televisions for
the big game.

However, rowdy revelers beware. Restau-

rants and bars will taken extra security precau-

dons

“Our biggest worry is having people in
here who are over—served,” said Mad Mex’s
manager, Nicolette Chilton.

Chilton said her employees will watch for
those who have been  and will be care-
ful when supplying alcohol.

Spice Cafe, which usually only has one
employee staffed for Sunday night, will have
someone checking identiﬁcations at the door,

in addition to a bus boy and a bartender, said.

jesse Creegan, manager of Spice Cafe on At-
wood Street

The businesses have also stocked up to
prepare for the surge of the Steeler Nation.

Six employees, instead of the usual two,

will work at Mellinger’s Beer Distributor on
Semple Street, which has ordered extra Pitts-
burgh beers for the game rush.

“State law regulates we close at 5 p.m., but
as long as you are in by 5 p.m., you get served,”
said owner Jaime Hively. ‘

I-lively said that the disnibutor had its high-
est sales the past two times the Steelers made
the Super Bowl.

Closer to Pitt campus, the answer to a suc—
cessful Super Bowl night is simple.

“A lot of fries. A lot of beer. A lot of dogs,”
said Terry Campasano, owner of The Onginal
Hot Dog Shop.

Those looking for a late night pizza ﬁx can
head over to Antoon’s, a “Steelers family—run
business,” said co-owner Ray Abraham.

Abraham expects Antoon’s to stay open
until 4 a.m. to accommodate the revelers, but
he suggests pre—orde1ing food.

“One year we ran out [of pizza]. They
started making pizza subs,” he said.

If Antoon’s becomes too rowdy, employ-

ees are ready to kick people out of the restau-
rant, added Abraham.

Although they have to work dunng the
game, the staff of Oakland’s bars and res-
taurants is still looking forward to an exciting
evening.

“If we’re stuck in here, we might as well
have fun,” said Chilton, whose employees can
watch the game while working at Mad Mex.

Pnmanti Brothers manager Bill Lantz
agreed. 4

“The atmosphere is pretty much to cel-
ebrate with customers,” said Lantz.

There‘ are many Primanti Brothers restau-
rants and different bars in Pittsburgh where
people can watch the game, he said, so he does
not expect his restaurant to become too un-
rub’-

As Super Bowl XLIH comes to a close
Sunday night, Oakland businesses will brace
themselves for the surge of students preparing
to take to the streets.

The Steelers last won the Super Bowl in
2006, and many businesses recall the mayhem
that ﬂooded’ Oakland following the game.

“It was ridiculous,” said Creegan.

People kicked down street signs, over-
turned cars and set couches on ﬁre, he said.

When mounted patrols came to clear the
streets in the early morning, garbagecans and
Terrible Towels were everywhere, added An-
gela Gaitaniella, a manager at Primanti Broth-
ers. I

In anticipation of this year’s celebratory ac-
tivity, Pittsburgh police will close Fifth Avenue,
Forbes Avenue and the majority of Central
Oakland to vehicles at the start of the ﬁnal
quarter, around 9 p.m. (Seepage Zgrap/Jia)

Many business owners agree this is im-
portant for crowd control, but some wish the
roads would stay open. ‘

“It’s not fair for the people who go back
and forth to work,” saidjoanne Keys, manager
at The Original Hot Dog Shop.

Five-day Postal Service
proposal delivers A

In an effort to negotiate eco-
nomic difficulties, the US. Postal

Service might be deducting from ‘

its daily duties.

On \X/ednesday, the postmas-
ter general announced to Con-
gress that the post ofﬁce is asking
to reduce the delivery of mail to
ﬁve days a week, according to the
Associated Press.

The Postal Service would not
necessarily cut Saturday delivery
should its schedule be abbrevi-
ated. Tuesdays are typically one
of the lightest days in mail ﬂow,

according to previous post-of— .

ﬁce studies. So the service might
forego a business day.
Regardless of which day the

i Postal Service might select to.’

omit, its proposed measure is an

acceptable response to dealing

with the difﬁcult economic condi— A

dons

Last year the post ofﬁce was
$2.8 billion in the red, and its pro-
jected to lose $6 billion this ﬁscal
year. i —
Although stamping out a day
of mail delivery might seem like a
drastic measure, there are appro-
priate substitutes and solutions to
sending snail mail. -

By no means is the Postal Ser-
vice the only agent that can trans-
mit mail. Privatized services such
as UPS, DHL and FedEx all of-
fer- services involving sending and
receiving mail. Consumers are far
from helpless —— even when the
Postal Service has the day off —
should they need to mail some-
thing on the ﬂy.

Other technologies also exist
that provide a similar service as
snail'mail. Since before the turn
of the 21st century, e-mail has

been a predominant method of
sending mail. E-mail is quite often
preferred since it’s faster than snail
mail and just as — if not more so
— reliable.

Faxing, although_ not quite
cutting—edge technology, provides
another alternative to using the
Individuals that are not up to
speed with technology or don’t
have access to e-mail would have
to rely on privatized services.

Snail mail, as its name implies,
is. infamously noted for being,
well, slow. Letters sent through
the mail, unless sent overnight,
are usually expected to take a few

days to deliver. If delivery takes A

one extra day, the change wouldn’t
be terribly drastic or intolerable.
Should the post ofﬁce consider
raising money by means of a hike
in stamp prices or a boost in taxes,
both measures would likely ‘be ill
perceived by the American people.
The next increase in postal rate -

_ scheduled for May — is projected

to raise stamps by 2 cents from
its current 42-cent ﬁrst—class rate.
A price boost beyond the typical,
steady increments would likely re-
sult in fewer users of the Postal
Service and thus more debt -for
the post ofﬁce. ‘
I A Postal Service study project-
ed annual savings of $3.5 billion
should the service stop one day a
week. I

The decision to take out a day
of delivery would be a great com—
promise for both the post ofﬁce
and the American people, but the
result might be for the better in
the long run. It is better to lose
one day a week of service than to
lose the service entirely.

Obama to restore national image

 
    

by Shane Levy
Colummidt

 studying. in London, I
recently traveled to Speakers Cor-
ner in Hyde Park. Speakers Cor-
net is a unique place: It provides
an experience unlike anything that
exists in the United States. It is an

unimpressive physical area com— ”

posed of concrete on the back-
drop of Hyde Park. The people
and wild array of opinions that
travel through ‘that’ small corner

of Hyde Park on Sunday morn— '

ings make Speakers Corner truly
distinctive. There, people are al-

lowed to speak freely on any sub-
ject they choose, so long as it does
not pertain to the Queen or the ‘

monarchy.

On that cold Londonmorn-I

mg, I wandered over to a small

group of older Londoners only

todiscover they were full of wis-
dom. They discussed the current
state of international’ affairs, par-

ticularly their views on the United '

States. It is hard as Americans to

admit our flaws and failures. But
if anything was made clear to me
on that brisk morning, it is that we
Americans are, indeed, stupid. To
quote one of the men I encoun-
tered, f‘How could we possibly
elect a former alcoholic and pe-
rennial goat to two terms of of-
ﬁce?” "

To quote  “How
could we
possibly elect a
_ former alcoholic and
perennial oat to two
terms o office?”

ti?

P For the past eight years, the
United States has been under

_ the leadership of an administra-

tion guided by warmongering
and sharp partisan politics.#Our
former president acted with de-

_ liberation to tear down _the walls

of our constitution and construct
an America that deals in torture,
deceit and corruption.

The former president left our
military stretched ‘too thin ﬁght-

ing a war against a global army of

terrorism. He‘ left our economy
teetering on the brink of total col-
lapse. Perhaps worst of all, he left
our nation struggling to live freely

_and peacefully in a democratic
society, while our government

continuously abused its powers to
destroy the principles this nation
was founded on.

Yet as President Barack Obama
placed his hand on Lincoln’s Bible

two days later, it was made clear,

in a most stirring fashion that
the United States‘ will correct the
failures of the previous admin-
istration and restore its national
image. .

The severity of the current
economic crisis that the United

.,States — and for that matter the
global community — is "experi-

encing is unquestionably great.
However, following the inaugura-
tion of our 44th president I ﬁnd
myself asking the question: Is

_there any doubt that the United

States will persevere through this

troublesome storm? A .
Throughout U.S. history, we

have overcome greater threats and

To the Editor,

Joseph W Fink
Associate Vice Chancellor
Facilities Management

Letters  

We would like to respond to. the Jan. 29 editorial, “Pitt’s weather response was not right for conditions,”
from the perspective of Facilities Management.
Prior to the main storm arriving,_ snow crews had already been on campus removing snow and salting
roads and sidewalks. As the storm intensiﬁed, additional crews and support personnel were called in. Cus-
todial support staff began to shovel and treat the areas near building entrances so that the grounds crews
could concentrate on the sidewalks and larger areas.
As the storm continued to intensify,~custodial and grounds crews were once again supplemented by
additional staff from the laborers shop who concentrated their efforts on the steps and hilly areas. In all,
we had more than 100 employees assigned to snow removal. We utilized more than 343 tons of salt and ice
melt and deployed 14 pieces of motorized equipment. Keep in mind this occurred from early Tuesday eve-
ning and izontinued non-stop through late Wednesday evening. Many of these same crews were called back
out early Thursday morning to deal with the additional snowthat accumulated throughout the night.
Despite our best efforts in preparation and contingency planning, the timing, intensity and duration of
this storm admittedly resulted in difﬁculty for students and personnel making their way around campus.
_ Facilities Management’s main objective is always the safety and convenience of the entire Pitt commu-
nity -—— during good times and bad. Sometimes it helps to remember that we are a “city within a city’ ’ with
an extremely large area to cover in a short period of time during extreme weather events.

 

ditor I

To the Editor,

Giles Howard has done it  He wrote yet another bigoted and one-
sided column, yesterday's “Obama should put America ﬁrst”

Statements such as, “The Obama administration must act quickly to reverse
this declaration and to purge the medical profession of religious zealots who
would deny their patients health care,” are laughably ridiculous.

‘ How can there be a free society with a multitude of viewpoints that also
denies anyone the right to conscientiously object to something he ﬁnds morally
reprehensible? , -

If patients want a speciﬁc procedure or drug, then they should go to a doc-
tor who provides it and not attempt to force that responsibility on someone
who thinks it is wrong. What about the “reproductive rights” of that not-so-

. small minority of women who disagree with pro-choice ethics? Don’t they also
deserve the right to go to a medical professional who shares their views? '

Howard goes on to call these same medical professionals “religiously de-
ranged.” This kind of language aimed at well-respected physicians should be
condemned. Sure, the moral standards of physicians may determine what pro-
cedures they do and do not do, but it does not affect the quality of their work.

more pressing circumstances than
the crisis we ﬁnd ourselves in. The
inauguration of the United States’
ﬁrst black president, ina country

,with a long and horriﬁc history
of slavery and racism, serves as

an incredible testament to those
achievements. .
It seems like an eternity in hell

‘since Obama was elected presi-

dent on Nov. 4, 2008. From that
point, we have endured. endless
waves of devastating economic
news, the deaths of more inno-
cent Americans and Iraqis and the
collapse of peace between Israel
and Gaza. ' ‘

. United Stateswill bea

The recent months have been
so devastating ‘that I had almost
forgotten why Obama had been
elected in the ﬁrst place. Events
had forced me to believe that
nothing short of a miracle could
possibly save the United States
and the global community from
certain collapse.

However, as the. sun shined
down on the Capitol and millions
of Americans stood through the
bitter cold, I was reminded that
as Obama stated so eloquently
in his address, “The Cynics fail to

. understand ...that the ground has
shifted behind them — that the

o

new country-

stale political arguments that have

consumed us for so long no lon-
ger apply.” Simply put,-. Obama’s
United States will not be the same

"country we have become accus-

tomed to. _, -
.  20, 2009, marked not only

- the inauguration of .our 44th pres— _

ident, but also the point in history

when the world will remember-
i that the United States took its ﬁrst

steps to creating a new and stron-
ger nation. _

Throughout his inaugural ad-
dress, O_bam_a continuously reiter-
ated that the United States would
take “bold_ and swift” action to

recreate our nation and ourselves

so that we may be a stronger and
better people and country as a
result. Andwith a strong guiding
wind of hope and determination
at our back, it is unquestioned"
that the United States will break
through these troubled waters and
will undoubtedly. come out, once
again, as the world’s leading su-
perpower.

Just as President John F.. Ken-
nedy remarked that “the torch has
been passed” or like President
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s statement
that the United States “has a ren-

inauguration marks the passage
from the old boys network in
Washington into a nation run on
the backs of a new “generation of
Americans.”

It will be on the backs ‘of our .

generation that the Unites States
rebuilds its roads, ﬁxes its schools,
builds a’ stronger eye on our ﬁ-
nancial institutions and ushers in
a new age of energy production

We face a long and arduous
road ahead, but with Obama at the
helm, it appears that the sun will
rise again in the United States.

Davis‘ classic rings true ahalf-century later

Kind of Blue 50th Anniversary
Legacy Edition

Miles Davis
Columbia/Legacy
Rocks Like: the greatest
jazz album ever made

 

 I could sit here-and criti-
 ‘. cally analyze every single track
 of Miles Davis’ “Kind of Blue”

     

‘F?’ by discussing structure, chord

progressions and. timbre’ even.
Scholars have released countless essays and
books praising Kuul of Blue as the ultimate
jazz masterpiece.

I could go into the Columbia/ Legacy 502%
Aunlueriagl Legag» Edition, noting how it in-
cludes, in addition to the ﬁve original tracks
already immortalized in the jazz world, the
rest of the studio recordings. It even features
four bonus tracks — one of which with an
alternative take — as well as a live recording
of “S0 What.”

But I don’t think I need to.

These bonuses are like the special features

on a DVD. For dedicated collectors, the I_,ega- _

gt Edzﬁon will be one more disc to treasure.

Kind of Blue was my ﬁrst jazz album. My
drum teacher had me go to Gallery of Sound,
a record store in my hometown of Scranton
(he always made me support the local music
efforts, no Best Buy or f.y.e. garbage). I knew
that Miles Davis was going to be good: All
my pot—head, hippie friends told me Davis
was a god for his 1970 album Bite/yes Brew

' (“There’s nothing like tripping on ‘Bitches

Brew,”’ they would say).

The only jazz I had listened to before Kuul
of Blue was the soundtrack to Disney/Pixar’s
2004,“The Incredibles,” if you even want to
count that. .

I won’t lie. I was bored after the ﬁrst
track, bored of the same verse and chorus. I
thought those notes 'only could combine so
many different ways in solos before making
me want to go read an encyclopedia. I

So I tried to think, ‘‘\What made this in-
teresting to the musicians playing this?” An
idea struck me. Ilgrabbed a pen and some
paper and started the album over. I figured
out jazz my own way,  down stories to
each song, why Davis wrote them and what
they are about.

* » -‘‘So \What’’ starts with a quiet, subtle pi-
ano solo, but then a moving bass line brings
the rest of the band in. You picture an early

morning in New York. The sun dominates
the crisp winter sky, and everyone is off to
work in trench coats and withbriefcases.
“Freddie Freeloader” is the guy who de-
cided to stay home and avoid the bustle, wake

‘ up at 11 instead of 7 and just wander around

the city without anything to do. 1 didn”t just
assume this description from the title of the
track: The tune is relaxing and laid—back, al-

though every now and then, I get the vibe

that Freddie sometimes wishes he had some-
thing to care about, be it either from a long
whine during Davis’ trumpet solo or an ir-
regular chord of tension from Wynton Kel-
ly’s piano. I

The rain starts to pour right before the
lunch hour in “Blue ir1 Green.” People are
already tired of the hustle and bustle, but

‘that doesn’t mean it’s oin to sto an ' e
. 8 8 P

soon.

Maybe some workers already miss their
signiﬁcant others. Davis’ muted trumpet in
the beginning of the track just adds to the
depressing milieu, and you can picture each
drop fall  an almost black—and—white back-
ground. "

Davis deﬁnes cool in “All Blues.” \X/alking
back to workfrom lunch break, there’s al-
ways this one“ guy who’s the epitome of cool.

He’s got the good clothes, the lovely women
andcis always  This guy is deﬁnitely
listening to “All Blues” while he walks.

Lastly, “Flamenco Sketches” is coming
home from the long day. The trumpet and
sax solos both remind‘ you that there’s just
another day tomorrowiwith tliegsatne old
chaotic push'and shove crowds, with each
person going their own way. At least there’s
relief occasionally from a note that reminds
you of your loved one, waiting for you to get
back, and those few hours you get to spend
with each other before going to a peaceful
sleep. A i

I’m no jazz expert. I know that Kiml of
Blue revolutionized jazz, but I don’t know
how, or why. All I know is that Davis puts
on a genuine performance in Kind 0]’ Blue. It’s
like when you get so absorbed inteta movie
you forget about the real world.

Kind of Blue is not only 21 jazz album for
beginners, it’s for experts too. It’s “The Dum-
my’s Guide to Jazz” and “The Jazz‘ Bible,” si-
multaneously.

Go to the library, the record store, your
dad’s old vinyl records, look for Kind of Blue
and experience something that should be

‘ On Your Sleeve

Jesse Malin

One Little Indian Records
Rocks like: A really good open-
mic night singer playing his
favorite tunes

 

Covers may scream with potential for murder,-

but in the hands of the right people they be-

come timeless and accessible throughout gen-
. erations.

Jesse Malin’s On Your Sleeve might be covers
galore, but this unique singer—songwiiter crafts
his covers in style. . ‘

He isn’t shy about his variety of choices, ei-
ther. Lyrics from song No. 1

Ion” willprobably sting deep,
as Malin laments, “I say your
dollar, dollar cut down real
low / You ain’t got nothin’
to show / Gonna step right
through the door / Not gon— _
na come back no more.”

And while the music for
Paul Simon’s “Me And Julio
Down By The School Yard” V
is much more lively, the contrast with the lyr-
ics should bring a look of bewilderment to
anyone paying attention: “The mama pajama
rolled out of bed / And she ran to the police

station / When the papa found out he began '

to shout / And he started the investigation /
It’s against the law.”

But no worries, Malin deﬁnitely brings more
to the musical table. Neil Young’s ‘‘Lookin’ For
A Love” introduces a bouncy beat and words

that will make everyone smile while 
lovers past, present and even future.

 

- Courtesy One Little Indian Records Side»

Malin threw in an Elton john redo with a
funky yet classic twist ~—- “Harmony” lives up
to its name with plenty of classic instruments

and a possible synthesizer. Oddly the mix is .

able to throw peace at listeners rather well. It

. should, if it wants to match the words, “Har-

mony, gee I really loveyou / And I want to
love you forever / And dream of the never,
never, never leaving harmony”

' Rolling Stones fans will recognize the song
“Sway,”_ just as Bruce Springsteen fans will rec-
ognize “Hungry Heart.” And while Malin has
adapted them to be ‘his own, sung in his subtly
passionate voice, neither can be classified as
mutated and mutilated.

Malin can go on to offer some more classic
rocking  to share in “Russian Roulette.”
In the tune he eagerly proclaims,‘ with hippie-
era slang, “Hey hey hey we’re in the movie. I
feel up and I feel groovy / Let’_s go out and get
i ' some of that. Gimme gimme
gimme some Russian Rou-
lette.” The track was origi-
nally by 19803 post—punk act
Lords of the New Church,
but in Malin’s hands it takes
a new  rock force,
verging on U2 territory.

Don’t rely entirely on
music‘ throughout the al-
bum. “Walk on the Wild
is not exactly musically
able to live up to its name, with just 
and brass"— but this is only because there’s a
story to  and it isn’t really a happy one. Ma-
lin’s smoothed-out, Sunday morning version
doesn’t exactly capture Lou Reed’s glory. '

Malin is a good judge of when to  up
the tunes and when to back off and let “the
words do what words do best: Tell a story.
Each song is emotional, the majority are rock-

ing and  in their instrument se1ec- .

tions and all have something to offer 
listeners. ,
