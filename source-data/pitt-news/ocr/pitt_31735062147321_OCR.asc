Assembly Refuses Approval
To_St_udentAAlliance Group

Decision Of Executive
Committee Upheld
After Debate

By Herbert Rackoff

While a crowd of students ﬁlled
Room 801, Cathedral, to overﬂowing
Tuesday evening, the Student Fac-
ulty Assembly oﬁicially rejected the
petition of Student Alliance for Uni-
‘versity recognition.

Coming as a climax to the most
spirited series of debates SFA has
heard since it replaced Student Coun-
cil two years ago, the assembly ap-
proved the action of the executive
committee in refusing Student Alli-
ance a charter.

The case for Student Alliance was
upheld by John Penrod, Ed36, presi-
dent of that group, and Israel L. Gold-
berg, C36. But, despite appeals by
Penrod and Goldberg, the motion for
recognition, after more than an hour
of heated discussion, could muster no
more than ﬁve votes.

Penrod, in opening the case, claim-
ed that the objections brought forth
by the executive committee when it
rejected Student Alliance’s petition
two weeks ago were invalid. The ex-
ecutive committee had insisted that
the program which Student Alliance
had laid out for itself was being car-
ried out by the Inquiry Forum, Inter-
cultural Associates, and SFA itself.

Penrod showed that the leaders of
both Inquiry and Intercultural Asso-
ciates ha.d empha.tically stated that
their groups could in no way serve
purposes parallel to those planned by

 Student Alliance, and that, in fact,

both of these leaders had signed peti-
tions which asked for its recognition.

Pen rod Defends Cause

“We not only feel that your com-
mittee’s objections to our application
for a charter are
continued, “but we also feel that
those objectio-ns raised are entirely
extraneous; to the problem, at issue.
If SFA" feels that there is no value-
to an organization which works con-
tinually to organize student sentiment
for ‘peace .  which prepares to
ﬁght, -e ,i.»‘32£1s!;.,.a«n.Y .1.'e.I>res.s.i.9.s..of the
constitu ional ri'gh’t'"df' 1553?‘ st'u'd‘e’n’t"o'r‘
teacher to expresshis opinions on any
subject . . . which strives to protect
minority groups on campus . . and
which conscientiously tries to clarify
the student’s customary confusion as
to his status in our society as a whole,
then, and only then, should SFA re-
fuse to extend legal recognition to
the Student Alliance.”

Concluding, Penrod stated that he
had petitions signed by 255 students
and 24 teachers and professors.

During the course of the meeting,
George Strong, C36, arose to protest
that his name was included upon one
of these petitions only because he
had signed it, thinking it was a class
roll. Penrod stated that.the petition
had on it a complete description of
the purposes of Student Alliance, and
that it was made perfectly clear what
was being signed. Strong insisted
that he had been duped. Robert Me-
tosky, C37, arose and pointed out
that “the roll went around, the peti-
tion went around, a.nd Strong signed
both.” Penrod, however, was unable to
produce the Strong-signed petitions.

Other Schools Cited

Goldberg continued Penrod’s argu-
ments on what he called a “slightly
different tack.” “I like to think,” he
began, “that I am speaking, not only
for myself, but for my constituents.
(We were elected, you know.) There-
fore I am going to support this re-
quest for a charter, though I am not
a lrtnember of Student Alliance my-
se .”

He went on to explain how practic-
ally every college and university,
large or small, which he has visited
on debate trips, was interested in the
a.ttitude of the University to the ques-
tion of liberal groups. He said, “As
far as I can see, we are absolutely

isolated, in the position of Mussolini“

against the world. How are we going
to break down the perhaps mistaken
attitude at other schools regarding
the University? I believe that only
by the recognition of liberal groups
such as Student Alliance ca.n we right
ourselves.”

Continuing, Goldberg raised the is-
sue of whether Student Alliance
would merely duplicate the work of
other organizations, saying: “There
is a need for any organization which
has a following. Inquiry Forum last
week voted solidly in favor of the
recognition of the Alliance, and the
signed petitions serve to affirm the
fact that the group has a following of
quite some size.”

Represent Minority Group

“Perhaps,” said Goldberg, “the char-
ter was denied because the executive
committee did not want to embarrass
the University. But when two years
ago the Student League for Social
Justice was denied a charter by the
then-existing Student Council, a simi-
lar action was taken, because its ex-
ecutive committee ‘did not want to
embarrass the University.’ Even if
this reason were valid, I am certain
that Student Alliance would not be
an embarrassing body to the Univer-
sity, since it is not representative of
the entire student body, but merely
representative of one minority group
on campus.

“I should like to correct an impres-

invalid,” Penrod . ,

Assembly Accepts
Laws, Constitution

Of M en’s Council

Plan For Activities Supervision
Of Men To Provide Complete
Campus Representation

The establishment of a Men’s Coun-
cil, a group to supervise the “admin-
istration of all activities pertaining
strictly to men students at the Uni-
versity,” was approved at SFA’s meet-
ing Tuesday evening.

Following the recommendation of
James Nicholas, E36, and his commit-
tee, the constitution and by-laws of
the new organization were adopted in
their entirety, indicating a Men’s
Council will be set up at the end of
this term.

Nominations of candidates and elec-
tion will take place before May 1.
Petitions for nomination, similar to
those for SFA, must be signed by 25
students in the school to which the
petitioner belongs. Membership is
limited to one representative for each
20'0 men in each of the undergraduate
schools. “This, said Nicholas, would
bring the total membership to 13, in-
cluding six from the College, three
from the School of Business Adminis-
tration, two from the School of Engi-
neering, and one each from the
School of Mines and the School of
Education. '

If only one candidate is to be elect-
ed, he must be a. senior; if two, the
next must be a junior, and, following
this rule, the third must be a sopho-
more. According to Nicholas’ ﬁgures,
there will be six seniors, four juniors,
and three sophomores in the Council.
The Council is in some, measure
self-perpetuating.’ Provision is made
in the constitution for the election by
the seniors of the group_ of, "not more
than 50 percent of the ‘underclass
membership by a two-thirds vote.

According to the constitution, the
Men’s Council will have under" its
_.jurisdiction. ..the  .. ..admin.istration — of-
men’s_customs, men’s loan fund, men’s
Spring Festival activities, men’s intra-
mural athletics and commencement
events for men.

A recommendation was submitted by
Ralph Appel, BA36, chairman of the
commencement events committee,
that all senior men wear blue and gold
bow ties during the last month of
school, _ ’

“Something’s Wrong Here"

Israel Goldberg, C36, moved that
this report be rejected on the ground
that it would add a tone of levity
which might overcome all good effects
that establishing such a tradition
might produce. This motion was
voted down. Then Charles Ebert,
C36, moved that “we adopt the recom-
mendation, but let them enforce it.”
This motion was also voted down.
“Something’s wrong here,” said David
Racusin, C37.

Racusin, chairman of the Sub-Fresh-
man Day committee, then recom-
mended, for the third time, that Sub-
Freshman Day be held on May 1. This
date had twice been rejected in for-
mer meetings, but wa.s readily ap-
proved Tuesday.

Regarding the coming Peace Assem-
bly, Herrymon Maurer, C36, chair-
man of the peace assembly commit-
tee, announced that the date for the
meeting ha.s been set for April 22.
He hopes to secure Bishop Francis J.
McConnell, of the Methodist Church,
as the principal speaker.

The report of the poll taken by the
transportation committee, as an-
nounced by Florian Majchrzak, E37,
chairman, showed that students spent
approximately $5,500 a week or $21,-
500 a month, coming to school. He
had no deﬁnite action, however, to
report. " -

The publication of scholarships and
fellowships available to students will
begin within the next two weeks, ac-
cording to a report submitted by Alan
Lloyd, Ed36, chairman.

Seniors To Name
Outstanding Man
In Voting Today

Booth Will Be Placed In Rooni
801, Cathedral; Result Of Poll r
May Guide ODK Selection

From 10:30 until 4:30 o’clock today,
senior men will vote in the ODK elec-

tion for Senior Award candidates.
The lone balloting place will be in the
Y Conference Room of Room 801, Ca-
dral.

Every man who receives at least
onevvote, according to Russell Con-.
nolly, C36, president of ODK, will be‘
considered for the ﬁnal choice. “To-‘
day’s result,” he said, ‘‘will not deter-
mine the ultimate winner, but will
give the faculty committee choosing
the winner an indication of the rela-
tive popularity of the candidates.”

A committee of eight juniors, in-
cluding members of ODK and the Stu-
dent Faculty Assembly, and headed
by Harry Zinsser, M39, assisted by
David Racusin, C37, will supervise the
election. After the group has turned
the totals over to Dr. Vincent W.
Lanfea.r, dean of men, active student
participation will cease. ’

Dr. Lanfear’s group, including Dr.
Omar C. Held, personnel assistant to
the dean of the College, Robert D.
Ayars, professor of accounting, Car
Cass, assistant professor of English
and Vifalter Rome, former assistant
dean of men, will begin work Monday.
Their decision will be made before the
end of’ the month, but will not be
announced until Tap Day, May 1.

According to the code approved one
year ago by ODK, the purpose of the
Senior Award is twofold: '

First—to recognize annually the
senior male student who has attain-
ed a high standard of leadership in
collegiate activities, to encourage
him to continue along. this line, and
to inspire others to strive for sim-
ilar attainments.

Second—to recognize that type of
student which, in the opinion of the
committee, the University should
aim to produce. 7.

The committee mentioned in the
above code, headed by Dr. Lanfear,
will determine the outstanding senior

--on—~t-he--basis of ch~a.raeter, -scholarship‘,"~

leadership, activities record, and so-
cial hearing.

The name of the winner of this
award each year is to be inscribed
upon the ODK walk, a promenade
which has been planned to connect
the entrance of the Cathedral with
Heinz Chapel. The walk will be lined
with granite blocks, upon which the
name of the award winner each year
will be engraved.

Only senior men are eligible to
vote. To check against duplications
in the voting, each senior must sign
his name opposite his place on ,a list
of eligible voters obtained from the
Registrar's office.

Brandon -Speaks On Civil Service
Before Governmental Group

Announcement of a proposed na-
tional civil service training school and
a talk by Albert Brandon, C36, on
“The American Civil Service” featur-
ed the regular meeting of the Curti
Club Tuesday. ’

James Donoghue, C38, reported on
the civil service school bill which was
recently introduced into the House of
Representatives by Congressman Dis-
ney of Oklahoma. The measure pro-
poses to establish a National Academy
of Public Affairs in Washington. Ac-
cording to the terms of the bill the
function of the school will be to train
men and women “in administrative
service in national and international
affairs, with a view to career service
011 the part of‘ its graduates.”

The academy would be maintained
on a nonsectarian basis, and tuition
would be free. Each member of the
House of Representatives would be
permitted to appoint one student per
year from his district; each senator
would have the right to appoint two
from the state-at-large. The Presi-
dent would have the power to appoint
50 students per year from the coun-
try-at-large, including the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico. The sum
of ﬁve million dollars‘ would be appro-
priated for the establishment of the
Academy. The bill has been referred
to the House Committee on Educa-
tion.

Brandon in his talk declared that
the extension of the civil service
throughout the government would
tend to give the party which had the
most money at election time an over-
whelming advantage at the polls, be-
cause patronage, a signiﬁcant element
in the succes of any party, would
thereby be eliminated.

Speaker Blames
Japanese Crisis

On Silk Decline

The trouble that is taking place in
Japan today has nothing to do.with
Russia or China but is merely the
result of a struggle for national con-
trol by a young group in the army,
according to Lennig Sweet, who spoke
before Inquiry Forum Wednesday.

The collapse of the silk market in
1929 and afterwards, due both to the
increasing use of rayon and to the
world-wide depression has created a
problem of first magnitude in Japan.
Since 1929 the agricultural groups
have suffered increasingly, and their
debt has almost doubled. 2 However,
the industrial elements have pros-
pered to some extent during the last
few years. The industrial control in
Japan is bound up closely with a
small group of families and they have
made substantial proﬁts, some ﬁrms
being able to issue 16 per cent divi-
dends on their earnings.

However, many of the younger

‘army officers come from the agricul-

tural groups. They are seeking to
alleviate part of the sufferings of the
farmers. This, according to Mr.
Sweet, is the reason for the Japanese
expansion into Manchuria for new
lands. Yet the industrialists object-
ed to the method by which the young
officers attempted to gain their object.
The business men held the opinion
that substantially the same beneﬁts
could -be achieved by a program of
friendly commercial expansion rather
than by shaking of the mailed ﬁst
and seizing of the new territory by
force.

In respect to the Russo-Japanese sit-

uation, Mr. Sweet said that the trou—’

ble between Russia and Japan is not
economic. Japan is afraid of Rus-
sian ideas, hence its attempt to set up
the buffer state of Manchukuo. One
of the primary questions in the minds
of many Japanese leaders, he said, is
whether Japan should not strike at
Russia now before the Soviet gets too
big for Japan to tackle.

Alumni Council To Select
Nominees For Trustees

Four alumni will be nominated as
candidates for positions on the Uni-
versity Board of Trustees at a din-
ner of the Alumni Council to be held

dral.

Two of the four nominees to be
selected at the meeting will be elected
to trusteeships through an election in
which all degree-holding alumni of the
University will be asked to partici-
pate. Ballots will be mailed to ap-
proximately 25,000 graduates not later
than April 15. They are to be re-
turned by May 1.

Dr, Kimball has become well-known
to student audiences over the country
as an engineer, author, editor, pro-
fessor, and administrator. He has
advanced f1-om his ‘original ﬁeld of en-
gineering to wide-sprea.d recognition
as an authority on educational prob-
lems.

At least 16 honorary fraternities
will tap initiates. according to lsra.el
D Goldberg, chairman of the com-
mittee. These include: Chi Rho Nu,
pre-medical fraternity; John Marshall
Club, pre—legal fraternity; Kappa Phi
Kappa, education fraternity; Phi
Lambda Upsilon, chemistry frater-
nity; Pi Tau Phi, scholastic fraternity
in the College; Quax, women's sci-
ence fraternity; Quill Club. literary
fraternity; Sigma Kappa Phi, modern
language fraternity; Sigma Tau, engi-
neering fraternity; and Meda, wo-
men’s scholastic society.

The name of each tappee will be
inscribed in the “Book of the Schol-
ars," a permanent volume containing
a complete record of students honor-
ed on this day.

To Present Awards

The Pi Tau Phi award of $10 will
be presented to the College senior
who has made greatest scholastic im-
provement during his last three se-
mesters at the University. Phi Lamb-
da Upsilon and the American Chem-
ical Society will each announce an
award. Sigma Kappa Phi will give 3
prize to the student outstanding in
each of the foreign languages.

Cash scholarships to be given in-
clude two City Panhellenic scholar-
ships, the Margaret Enright Memorial
award of Theta Phi Alpha fraternity,
and the scholarship of the Delta Phi
Epsilon fraternity. The Panhellenic
scholarships are valued at $100 each.

The congratulations hour at 3_:30
o’clock will follow the tapping exer-
cises and the distribution of awards.

mony will be Edward Parrack, C36,

Governor Rejects Plan
For Electing Trustees

Governor George H. Earle delivered
his second “ultimatum” to the Uni-
versity Vvednesday in a letter to Sam-
uel A. Taylor, ﬁrst vice president of
the Board of Trustees.

Rejecting the University’s plan for
a reorganization of the board, the
Governor indicated that he will not
approve the University’s state appro-
priation next year if the reorganiza-
tion of the board to suit his sugges-
tions and those of the legislative in-
vestigating committee is not made.

The Governor had previously set
March 1 as the deadline for the Uni-
versity to effect the “necessary
changes” in its policies. At that time
the school submitted a plan to elect
six alumni trustees, who, in addition
to the nine alumni already on the self-
perpetuating board, would complete
the demanded quota of 15 alumni
members.

“The suggestion,” wrote the Gov-
ernor, “is not satisfactory to me.”

;ing with a Congratulations. Hour in Heinz House later in
the afternoon, the good students will bask in a round of
gloi'y—glory, that comes perhaps all too seldom.

Ordinarily, it seems, the scholars come into their own
on but three occasions during the year. Two of these
are connected with the end of the semester and the
issuing of blueprints and the third is the affair of today.
At these times the outstanding students ﬁnd some mate-
rial rewards for movies they passed up, automobile rides
they avoided, and walks in the park they didn't take.
At the same time the average student is quite apt to
hazard a look around to take stock of things and render
unto himself a healthy kick in the ‘pants because he
could have made a better scholastic showing than he did.

For the sake of consistency, it must be added that the
scholars come in for one more taste of glory, that of
havingnone or more asterisks to form the stars in their
crowns as their names appear in the commencement pro-
gram. These, of course, indicate that the student has
graduated “with honor,” “with high honor,” or “with
highest honor." Here again the scholar has it all over
the average student, whose only hope for a decoration
in connection with his name is the ﬂeur-de-lis aﬁair, sig-
nifying “in absentia.” _

By and large, the big day for those who reach the
heights in academic circles is today’s Tap Day. The 16
honorary societies and the donors of several individual
‘awards and prizes will pass out a lot of honors to stu-
dents who have attained them by no quirk of fate nor by
any trick other than hard work. To the tappees and the
award winners belongs the glory of the day, for it is
rightfully theirs and its spirit should carry over to other
days. ‘While we're not permitted to print your names
today, The News extends congratulations to those ac-
corded these new honors.

How Are Your Cavities?
F SOMEONE TOOK A LOOK into your mouth and
remarked that you had seven cavities that required
ﬁlling, you'd probably tell him he was a bit touched.

If someone told you that you could, without going off
campus, have a thorough examination made of your
‘teeth at no charge to you whatsoever, you would still be
:somewhat skeptical.

And if someone asked you how long it has been since

:you’ve given your teeth any attention other than the

daily once-over or twice-over with a toothbrush, you
might tax your memory in recollection.

All this is apropos of the results of the ﬁrst day’s den-
tal -examinations for men students, sponsored by the
Men’s Student Health Service. This new aid to students
is designed to acquaint them with defects in their teeth
and to encourage them to have these corrected.

From the results of the ﬁrst day's examinations, there
is a lot of room here for such a service. Eleven stu-
dents reported the ﬁrst day and a check-up on their
teeth revealed no fewer than 83 cavities in all, an aver-
age of more than seven cavities each! One needn't be
a dentist to surmise that this is not as it should be.

The eleven were of no special selection, doubtless
there are scores of other students whose dental hygiene
has been similarly neglected. It seems somewhat strange
that in this day and age college students, particularly,
should have to be warned about neglecting a vital part
of their health. It will seem more strange if the Univer-
sity men do not take advantage of the opportunity pre-
sented by the Health Service. No charge whatsoever is
made, and no obligation is entailed that the boy must
have the necessary dental work done. That is, with the
exception of his own intelligence on the subject. It has
also been announced that an X-Ray will be taken free of
charge if the condition of the student's teeth warrants it.

There is no getting around the point that the time-
honored statement, “Always be true to your teeth or
your teeth will be false to you,” is more of a truth than
a wisecrack. It might not be amiss to advocate a new
battle-cry on the campiis.' This would be something like
“Open wider, please."

And Still They Go

The Panther basketball players should be summoned
to turn in their Union cards any day now.

After wading through a 26-game schedule, the Panthers
are being called upon to play still another ball game
Monday night. “West. Virginia’s Mountaineers upset the
Pitt apple-cart Wednesday night and gave the Panthers
the odd experience of seeing one foul shot throw the
whole Eastern Intercollegiate Conference race into :1 tie.

No one is particularly worried that the Pitt cagers
won't have enough stuff left to sock it to Carnegie Tech
Monday night. It might, moreover, be suggested to the
crusading Tech boys that maybe they'd better leave Mr.
Max Hannum’s scalp alone while he still has a chance to
bring them their ﬁrst cage title.

At the University of Southern California all candidates
for student oﬂices are required to attend a special short
course in constitutionality and to pass an examination
on the course.

Sehr Gut Nicht Wahr?

A professor at Miami University is going to try a
new experiment in teaching foreign languages to stu.
dents. Radio equipment will be installed in the room
and the students will listen to short-wave broadcasts
from abroad in order to improve their pronunciation.

Their Own Medicine

Instead of being a lazy individual who sticks to the
Cambus because “it's a nice, easy life,” the average uni-
versity professor is one of the nation’s busiest profession-
.al men, according to a Northwestern University study.
It was found that the average teacher spent nine hours a
day in work connected with his classes and research,
delivered 4.8 outside lectures each year, traveled 1,213
miles, wrote two articles for publication, published a
fifth of a book, taught evening classes, gave radio

speeches and served an official for some learned society.

 

Alliance Refused
Oﬂicial Standing

(Continued from Page One)
sion,” Goldberg said, “that the mem-
bers of Student Alliance are danger-
ous Reds and disrupters of the peace.
They are not dangerous radicals. I
know almost all of them, and they are
nice respectable people who comb
their hair regularly."

Goldberg concluded by remarking:
“If we keep on denying st.udents the
right to petition and to group together
as they wish, then SFA will go the
way of Student Council."

During the discussion, printed plat-
forms of the ='Alliance were passed
around to the members of SFA. Dr.
S. P. Franklin then arose to say that
SFA had as objectives every one of
the points submitted by the Alliance
on its programs. Said Dr. Franklin:
“It would be an admission of weak-
ness on our part. and a show of in-
competence, if SFA agreed to let any
other organization take over those of
its duties which are listed here on the
platform of the Student Alliance. In
my opinion, there is nothing here
which is not amply covered by pro-
visions made by SFA.”

Need Not Spread Propaganda

N. Robert Ayars, professor of ac-
‘counting, continued this argument, in-
sisting that it is not the function of
the University or any organization
connected with it to spread propa-
ganda on anything whatsoever.

Dr. Vincent W, Lanfear, dean of
men, emphasized the fact that the
students of the University have a
great deal more freedom than stu-
dents of many other schools, and that
they are in no danger of losing it.
He censured members of Student Al-
liance for making undercover remarks
about the methods of the executive
committee.

Regarding the methods of the exec-
utive committee in discussing the
charter, Theodore W. Biddle, assist-
ant dean of men, stated that this
committee had discussed all angles of
the matter with Bruno Pozzi, C36,
former president of Student Alliance,
for a period of more than two hours,
and that the meeting was character-
ized by “careful consideration and a
spirit of friendly cooperation on both
sides." On practical admission by
Pozzi, stated Mr. Biddle, the only real
purpose of Student Alliance was
thoroughly to discuss controversial
questions. This, he said, is a policy
of SFA itself, so that the executive
committee decided not to grant it
recognition.

Enlarge Forum Committee

Following Mr. Biddle’s statement,
the motion made by Goldberg, and
seconded by Elizabeth Glass, C36, that
the Alliance be recognized, was
brought to a vote, and defeated. Then,
following a suggestion by Miss
Theresa Kalin, instructor in English,
Goldberg moved that the SFA Forum
committee be enlarged, and that Pen-
rod be given a position on this com-
mittee, so that it might take over the
purposes of Student Alliance. Penrod
was willing to accept the position,
but made ‘ the statement that this
could in no way be interpreted as
taking the place of. Student Alliance
and its functions.

This motion also was defeated. Dr.
Lanfear then moved adjournment, but
Elizabeth Glass, 036, rose to a point
of order, and moved that the Forum
committee be enlarged and empower-
ed to hold frequent forums with Pen-
rod as a member. This motion was
carried by a close vote.

Syriaiisﬁ Hold Initial
Meeting In Cathedral

The» ﬁrst meeting of the Syrian
Committee ever held in the Cathedral
was held last night in Room 1309.
Under the chairmanship of Dr. Nich-
olas Bitar, D28, the committee met
to lay plans for a Syrian Room in the
Nationality group.

A sum of money was deposited by
the committee with the University to
assure them a room.

The Scottish Room Committee is

morrow afternoon in Room 1309, Ca-
thedral. Students and faculty mem-
bers are invited to attend the affair.
A small admission fee will be charg-
ed.

legiate Club of Pittsburgh will be

Letter

Editor, The Pitt News:

I wish to clear up a misunderstand-
ing which arose concerning my alleged
signing of a petition asking for recoc-
nition of the Student Alliance.

At the Student-Faculty meeting
Tuesday evening, I was accused of
signing this petition. To say that I
signed this is false.

On March 4 about 3 o'clock I refused
to sign such a petition. Later in a
class the same day there was circu-
lated a class roll and there was also
said to be circulated a petition_ Mr.
Metosky said that I signed both. I
saw no recognizable petition and
signed my name but once on what I
considered the class roll.

Members of the Student Alliance
when asked, in the meeting, said they
would produce this petition showing
my signature. They failed to do so.

However, they told me outside of
meeting that the petition was dis-
guised as a class roll and that I had
been tricked into signing.

If an organization has to use such
tricks to gain its supporters, would
not such action be typical of all its
work? Such being the case, there is
no place at the University of Pitts-
burgh for the Student Alliance.

GEORGE W. STRONG.

 

Fine Arts Movie
Patrons Shaken

By ‘Intolerance’

By Ray Maclntyre

Four mighty and tempestuous cli-
maxes to the four parallel stories of
“Intolerance,” coming all at once and
with bewildering rapidity, left Fine
Arts moviegoers a little shaken last
Monday night when the D. W. Grif-
ﬁth ﬁlm of 1916 was shown in Falk
Schooh

The ﬁlm concerned the slums of
today (1916), persecution of the
French Huguenots in the sixteenth
century, the betrayal of ancient Baby-
lon by the high priests, and the story
of the Cruciﬁxion, all illustrating the
“evil which the self-righteous have
perpetuated through the ages.”

The Babylon story ends with the
ﬁghting hordes of Cyrus the Persian
attacking the unsuspecting Babylo-
nians, revelling and feasting in tribute
to Ishtar, goddess of love. They have
been betrayed by the high priests,
worshippers of the God, Bel, who are
jealous of Ishtar. The Persian army
is reinforced by Northern barbarians
dressed in skins and pagan headdress,
and savage Ethiopians bedecked in
layers of rings and bracelets.

Mercenaries of the French army en-
gaged in a terrible orgy of butchery
and carnage instigated by the queen
in an attempt to wipe out the Hu-
guenots climaxes the French episode.

“Intolerance in Palestine” is con-

cluded in the picture with Christ be-

ing led to the cross to the jeering of
the angry mob. .

The modern version ends more
pleasantly, with the hero saved from
hanging at the last minute. The
black hood and noose have been ar-
ranged and the executioners stand
ready with knives which will cut the
strings releasing the trap door, when
a special order from the governor ar-
rives, and husband and wife are re-

united.

Panther Trackmen Defend
CIC Team Title Tomorrow

 

Only Groat And Connelly Remain From 1935 Champions;
Relay Team Holds Central Intercollegiate Mark

 

Pitt's “suitcase” trackmen packed

their spikes, pushers, and suits yes-

terday and will move westward to defend their CIC title at South Bend

tomorrow.
Last year seven men drove home
victory in the Central Intercolleglates

from South Bend with a “surprise”
by scoring 23 and one-sixth points,

three more markers than the runner-up Notre Dame contenders.

Arvel Fleming and Freddie Kiger,¢
who between them accounted directly
for 15 points and indirectly for ﬁve
more of the 23-odd total, will not re-
spond to roll-call at the 1936 meeting.
Fleming tied the existing American
and CIC records in the 65-yard low
hurdles.

Cy Pelucha and Johnson, who ac-
counted for the remaining points in
the pole vault, will also be absent
from this year’s running, which leaves
Coach Olson with just two relay men
to show for the remains of that 1935
CIC championship outﬁt.

For the 1936 event Olson has boost-
ed his squad to 12 men to help offset
the loss of Kiger, McDonald, Fleming,
Pelucha, and Johnson. Tomorrow,
however, the Michigan State, Mar-
quette, Notre Dame, Kansas, and
Michigan title-aspirants will not take
their eastern opponent so lightly.

Pitt Enters 12 Men

In replacing Kiger and McDonald,
Art Thomas and Jack McConnell have
not taken away any speed from—the
relay quartet, yet lack the experience
and seasoning of last year’s seniors.
The Pitt relayers will not be favored
to ring up a repeat victory in the
relay championships since the Unit
versity of Michigan team nosed out
the Pitt boys in the Butler Invitations
earlier in the indoor campaign.

Pitt entries include: Thomas, Groat,
McConnell, and Connelly in the mile-
relay; Pete Bennett and Redmon
Oden in‘ the high jump; Harold Test
in the mile; Andy Lasky in the hur-
dles; \Valter Good in the broad jump
and hurdles; Dick Mason in the
sprints; Bob Gerrety in the pole
vault; and Franklyn Theriault in the
two-mile.

Coach Olson also plans to use the
IC4A 60-meter indoor champ, Art
Thomas, in the sprints. Olson, As-
sistant Coach Potts, and Ted Cor-
bett, former two-mile champ, will be
included in the Panther party.

Boxers Conclude
Season Against
Tarlans Tonight

Carnegie Tech’s .crew of battlers_ in-
vade the Panther lair tonight at the
Stadium in the ﬁnal match of the
season for both teams. The ﬁrst bout
will start at 8:15 o’clock.

For the ﬁrst time this year, the box-
ers will be the main attraction. Usual-
ly basketball or wrestling, sometimes
both, were listed on the program
along with the boxers.

Schricker will probably start Conti
or Vogel in the 115-pound class; Cap-
tain Paslowski in the 125-pound
group; Konick in the 135-pound divi-
sion; Tomarelli in the 145-pound class;
Dines in the 155-pound bout; Leonard
in the 165-pound division; Linderman
in the 175-pound group; and Schmidt
in the heavyweight class.

The Eastern Intercollegiate Boxing
Conference's individual champion-
ships will be decided on March 20
and 21 in a tournament to be held at
the PAA. Only four entrants, selected
from the teams in the conferences on
a basis of their season's record, will
ﬁght in each weight division.

Captain Al Paslowski and Abe
Konick are being groomed by
Schricker for this year’s National 111-
tercollegiate Boxing Championships
at the University of Virginia on
March 27 and 28.

Swimmers Enter
ESA Title Meet

Capt. Lindberg, Anderson, Locke,
McQui1lan To Make Trip

A quartet of Pitt swimmers will leave
today for New York where they will
compete in the Eastern Collegiate As-
sociation swimming championships,
which will be held tomorrow after-
noon in the DeWitt Clinton high
school pool.

VVith Franklin and Marshall and
Rutgers favorites to capture the team
title, Coach Corr hopes to salvage
some of the spoils of the affair by
concentrating his entries in a limited
number of events. That explains his
reason for taking only a few men to
the eastern center.

Captain Russ Lindberg, winding up
a spectacular career as a varsity star,
heads the list of Panther mermen.
IL-indy, who took second in the 440-
yard freestyle last year, will seek new
honors in the 150-yard backstroke in
tomorrow’s carnival. In dual compe-
tition this season, Lindberg hasn’t
been beaten, and his chances for add-
ing the backstroke title to his long list
of honors are exceedingly bright.

Red McQuillan, defending ESA ti-
tleholder in the fancy diving. will be
out to keep his crown. Red, handi-
capped by sickness earlier in the sea-
son, has returned to top form in the
last three meets and should give the
cream of the eastern crop divers a
good run for their money.

Corr will pin his hopes for a title
in the distance events on sophomore
Tom Locke, thus far unbeatable in
the 440 this season, except in the Ohio
State meet where he was touched out
by All-American Dexter Woodford.
Locke will participate in the 440 and
perhaps the 220.

The fourth Pitt entry will be Tom
Anderson, another sophomore, who
will race in the 220-yard breaststroke.

Last-Minute Foul
Drops Panthers
Into League Tie

Pitt Loses, 43-42, At Morgantown,
With Gocke, Phares Leading
West Virginia In Upset

Lights burned brightly Wednesday
night down along the Morgantown
trails, for West Virginia’s brilliant
basketball ﬁve came from behind in
the ﬁnal 30 seconds to score three
points and a thrilling one-point victory
over Pitt's then league-leading cagers,
43-42.

It was Squint Phares who did the
dirty work. With three seconds to go
and the score knotted at 42-all, Mr.
Squint was fouled by Ted Roderick.
He took a squint at the rim and in
went the ball for the deciding point.

The Panthers’ loss pushed them
from their top position of the confer-
ence down to a tie for the lead with
Carnegie Tech. It means another
play-off for the title, the second in
the last two years. The playoff game
between Pitt and Tech has been
scheduled for Monday night at 8:15
o'clock in the Stadium pavilion.

Wednesday night’s game was a nip-
and-tuck affair from the very start.
The Mountaineers jumped to an 8-2
lead but the Panthers got hot and tied
it up at 10-10. From here until the
end of the half the lead see-sawed
back and forth with the West Vir-
ginia outﬁt spurting ahead at the half,
25-22.

Score Tied Four Times

In the ﬁrst ten minutes after the
rest period, Pete Noon swung the
Panthers back into the running with
his short shots under the hoop and
the score was deadlocked no fewer
than four times with the Mountaineer
ﬁve coming from behind every time.

With one minute to go, the Panthers
went into the lead 42-40, when Eddie
Spotovich dropped in a basket_ Thirty
seconds later, Barna, the Mountaineer
center, sank a long shot from the mid-
dle of the court and the 3,200 fans
went wild. _‘R.'oderick then fouled
Phares, and the scrappy little guard
dropped in the free throw to give the
Mountaineer ﬁve the game.

Red Gocke and Squint Phares led
the scoring for the Mountaineers with
12 points apiece, while Pete Noon led
the Panther columns with his nine

markers.

Tobacco in its natural state is harsh»
and strong. Though “cured” by the
grower before sale, itis unsuited for
use Without further aging. During
this aging period (which ranges in
the case of Lucky Strike from 1%
to 3 years) important changes occur.
These “Nature” changes result in
the partial “smoothing out” of the
original harsh qualities of the leaf.
Our process of manufacture carries
these improvements many steps
further—as every Lucky Strike
Cigarette exemplifies: A Light
Smoke of rich, ripe-bodied tobacco.
