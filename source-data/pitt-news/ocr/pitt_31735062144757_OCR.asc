GOW DECLINES CLUB
OFFER AS ADVISOR

States Relationship To Liberal
Group Must Be Same
As To Others

The necessity of maintaining an
equally close connection with all
campus student organizations has
caused J. Steele Gow, executive sec-
retary of the university, to decline
his election to the faculty committee
of the Liberal Club, he said late yes-
terday. Mr. Gow was chosen to ﬁll
the vacancy caused by the recent
resignation of Dr. G. A. Lundberg,
associate professor of sociology.

In a letter to the organization Mr.
Gow said that he has tried to “fol-
low the policy of not having any
closer connection with one student
organization than with another.” He
further states that this policy is de-
sirable in his opinion from the point
of view of his responsibilities as a
university administration officer.

One vacancy now remains on the
committee of faculty advisers of the
club following Mr. Gow’s declina-
tionf Present faculty advisers are:
Dr. Ralph S. Boots, professor of po-
litical science; Dr. Oliver F. Reiser,

assistant professor of philosophy;
Walter R. Hovey, assistant professor
of ﬁne arts, and Dr. P. W. Whiting,
assistant professor of zoology.

The duty of the faculty committee,

say officers of the Liberal Club, is
to reject or approve speakers, and
advise the club in any investigations

it undertakes. .....  .

Dr. lLundberg’s resignation wasoc.-
casioned, he said in a letter to the

club Wednesday, through his refusal

to serve with the club board of ad-
visers which “it appears is expected
to be in reality a board of censors
through which the administration
desires to protect students against
new, and in its opinion, possibly
dangerous ideas.”

TWENTY CHOSEN FOR
OWL HALL OF FAME

Seniors Selected As Model:
Of Type Pitt Aims
To Produce

Twenty Pitt seniors representing
the highest type of men and women
the University aims to produce have
been tapped to the traditional Hall
of Fame and will be a feature of the
1929 Owl, announces William Niles
Anderson, Col ’29, editor of the year
book. The ten men and ten co-eds
were elected by Student Council in-
stead of by the Owl staff as in pre-
vious years.

Explaining the new manner of
electing the members of the Hall of
Fame, Anderson. said the staff felt
that Student Council, whose mem-
bers are juniors and seniors, is in a
better position to judge the qualiﬁca-
tions of candidates than a staff of
juniors and underclassmen. This
custom of honoring seniors who had
been outstanding in activities and
personality began» three years ago
when the Hall of Famevsection ap-
peared in the 1927 Owl forthe ﬁrst
time. Until this year, Owl staifs
acted as judges. ;

Members of the Student Council
who voted on the Hall of Fame are:
Harry Decker, Dent. ’28, president;
Mabel De Forest, Ed. ’29; Betty
Clark, Ed. ’29; Patricia O’Leary,
Dent. ’28; Harry G. Ellsworth, Dent.
’28; John Davis, Dent. ’29; Andrew
Salata, Dent. ’28; E. Colvin Hassen-
plug, Dent, 29; Allan Booth, Dent.

voice was heavier and more resonant
then than it is now.

Russel spent several years with
the troup and then left it to enter
the Pittsburgh Chorus I nning ae-
riously the cultivation 0 his voice.
At this time singing was only a
preoccupation and he spent his time
as loan teller in a local bank. This
was necessary, he explains, to earn
the necessary funds to enable him
to obtain a college education.

Russel held his teller’s position, for
ﬁve years during which he spent
much time in the training his
bass voice. The Pittsburgh C was

Older than most of his classmates
he is content with school because he
feels that he is approaching the goal
he set for himself ﬁfteen years ago
when his position did not allow him
to even attempt to approach it in a
concrete way. He ‘tells about him-
self in this fashion:

“I ride for recreation, I am op-
posed to Prohibition, and I like asso-
ciation 0 men who can win without
boasting, and lose without whimper-
ing. I have been taught ego but not
to a repulsive extent. I know my
limitations but I must believe in my-
self and my abilities to gain self

“I am the best bass that ever was
on the Pitt campus,” Russel states.
And he is willing to back this state-
ment with actual proof.

And Russel is self conﬁdent.

Victory

 

 

 

The freshman tennis team de-
feated Peabody high school on the
stadium courts last Tuesday, 6-1.
Although Peabody won but one
match they proved a stubborn foe.

“Eddie” Jacobs had little trouble
defeating Goodman, No. 1 man for
Peabod . He won his match 6-0, 6-0.
“Eddie' was later aired with “Milt"
Cohen in the doub es against Good-
man and Broida. “Eddie” and “Milt"
won the doubles b the convincing
score 6-0, 6-0. “Mit” also won his
singles, 6-8, 6-4.

Snodgrass played Fry in what
later proved the closest match of the
afternoon. Snodgrass won the ﬁrst
set 6-1 but dropped the second 3-6.
Snodgrass ﬂashed sparkling form to
cop the third set 2-6, giving Pitt
the victory.

‘Gurley and Foote each won their
matches but only after a hard ﬁght.
Gurley defeated Davidson 6-3, 7-5.
Foote won from Maites 6-3, 6-4.

In the second doubles Pitt met
their only setback. Vollmer and

-Abrams were no match for Fry and

Davidson, who won 6-2, 6-1.

KENNETH WIBECAN,
GIBBY WI-ILCH CLOSE
WORK TOMORROW

Both will Attempt To Set
New Records In Big
Four Meet
___.L__

PANTHERS ARE FAVORED

Many Long Standing Marks
Certain To Fall In
Annual Carnival

Two brilliant Panther trackmen
will take part in ‘the last meet of
their career in the stadium under the
colors of the Blue and Gold tomor-
row afternoon when Captain Gilbert

Welch and Kenneth Wibecanmake
their ﬁnal stand in the Big Four
track meet on the stadium cinders
and turf. Both men are seniors and
providing they do not make the tri
to the intercollegiates at Harvar ,
May 26, it will be their last inter-
colle iate meet.

Wi ecan, Pitt’s great Negro ath-
lete, raced the 220-yard dash in
211-6 seconds against Penn State
last week to better the old Pitt
mark established in 1926 by 3-5 of a
second. Ken also covers the 100-yard
dash and the 440-yard sprint in close
to record time and tomorrow after-
noon he will attempt to break the
existing 220 mark and will also set‘
a terriﬁc pace in the other two
clashes. Wibecan is one of the best
runners to ever run under the colors
of. the Blue and Gold. He has sel-
domed iinished~ - other than first place
in the entire fouryears of his run-
ning career under Coach Shea.

Welch Closes Career

Captain Gibb Welch will take his’
last crack at local records in’ the
discus throw, broad jump, shot put,-
and javelin throw and attempt _to
lower his own mark in all of these
events. In the recent meet with Penn
State Gibb added an inch to his
javelin mar established_this spring
when he tossed the-spear‘ 182 feet,
3 inches. He will take a crack at this
record and also throw to beat his
heave of 137 feet 2 inches in his pet
event, the discus. Gibby is the most
versatile athlete ever to perform at
Pitt and he will be the busiest con-
testant on the field tomorrow when
he attempts to write ﬁnish in the
highest ﬁgures that l have been
marked down beside his name in the
four events.

Pitt Favored

This meet which was man
last ear at Morgantown wil bring
the avorite harriers, jumpers, and
weightmen of Carnegie Tech, Wash-
Jeﬂ', and West Virginia to the Pan-
ther stadium for their annual track
and ﬁeld competition. Pitt is the
heavy favorite in every event but
due to the fact that five places will
count the Panther’s chances are not
so certain. The Panthers should
make a clean sweep of the sprint
events while the Mountaineers have
a very sli ht edge in the distances.

Coach hea.’s men have walloped
both West Virginia and Carnegie
Tech in dual meets durin the sea-
son while the other mem er of the
Big Four, Wash-Jeff, has been in
very few meets this season. The
Presidents’ marks no way a proach
the Big Four records and t ey are
conceded little c ce of placing
anything but fourt place.

One of the closest events of the
afternoon will be staged in the 150-
yard high hurdles and the 220- ard
hurdles. Knobloclt of Pitt, Lock art
of Carnegie, and Maxwell of West
Virginia are all expert timber top-
pers who have won over each other
alternately in these two races this
season. ‘

Pickard To Try 13 Feet 5 Inches

In the pole vault Vic Pickard,
Pitt’s record holdin vaulter, should
have an easy time ut he—-will not.
Despite the fact that he will have no
competition from any of the con-
testants he will battle with his own
mark of 13 feet 1% inches and at-
tempt to raise it to 13 feet 5 inches,
the mark which he tried for in the
Carnegie Tech meet.

Don Gwynn, Panther lightweight
hammer tosser, will attempt to break
his old hammer mark established
last year. Roy will try to take the
measure of Buvinger, classy Moun-
taineer distance man who paces
along with Steinder, a teammate in
the half mile, mile and two mile.

Competitors from other schools
who will bear watc ' tomorrow
are Amos and Harris rom Wash-
Jeff, Kennedy and Murray of Car-
negie Tech, Stender, Buvinger, and
Taylor of West Virginia.

Si-ZYMOUR TOURNEY
STARTSNEXT WEEK

—..4._—__.

Dave O’Loughlin Will Defend
Univers ty Net Title
In Stadium

 

The annual Harry Seymour
Trophy‘ Tournament for the Univer-
sity tennis championship will be re-
vived on the campus next week when
the cream of the University netters
will start the eliminations. Not only
the varsity and freshmen racquet-
ers are eligible to compete in the
tournament, but any student‘ en-
rolled ‘at the University is eligible.
In past years there have been many
non-varsity and non-freshman team
players in the tourney, although the

winner has always been a member
of the varsity.

For many years it has been the
custom to hold the tournament at
the conclusion of the school year to
determine the champion Pitt tennis
player. The matches are chosen by
lot, but the probable winners are
seeded into various‘ sections so that
they will not compete early in-the

play. The eliminations are then run

in regular fashion until the cham-
pionship is settled. The winner is
considered the best tennis player in
the school for the year.

The tournament gets its name
from the fact‘ that any Seymour,
former sports writer for the Pitts-
burgh Sun,_ presents the-winner with
a magniﬁcent silver lovin cup,
which the player may hold for the
year,‘s.nd' may retain. permanently
after he has won it three times in
succession. However the probability
of anyone winning the cup perma-
nently for many years is not likely.

, Winnersof the trophy in the last
few years are Arnold Silverman, the
Baltimore ﬂash, who captained the
varsity in the year that he won the
cup, 1924; Dave O'Loughlin, who
won‘. the tournament twice, once in
1925 and again last year. In 1926
B ron. Baur took the tournament
a ter ﬁghting his way through some
of the best players that have ever
competed, for it was in this year
that the Pitt racqueters went unde-
feated. _

Baur is still in school and will
probably be one of the seeded play-
ers in the tournament this year.
Dave O’Loughlin has not played this
year with the varsit , but is in
school and will probab y be another
seeded player providing he enters,
which is almost certain. John
0’Loughlin, captain of the varsity

this year, will certainly compete and .

it is probable that all the other var-
sity net men will also enter the com-
petition. The freshmen, too, are en-

tering a large delegation and it is -

probable that one. of their number,
Eddie Jacobs will come through and
win. the cup. Eddie has beaten some
of the best on the varsity team al-
ready this year and the man who
eliminates him will certainly have
earned the title.

sleigh ride 5 to 2. It is doubtful if
the team will have much trouble re-
peating the process. But the Plaid
are bound to put up a good ﬁght and
have an outside chance to upset the
dope. In the last meeting of the two
teams, Baur and Cable wonia mara-
thon set from Schmidt and Glosser
of Tech 18-16, proving that the two
teams were better matched than the
score showed. At least we can ex-
pect to see some good tennis.

Next Tuesday afternoon Juniata
will visit the stadium and meet the
Panthers. The Indian netters have
not played very impressively in their
last few matches and are not liable
to cause the team much trouble.
Dickinson defeated the Indians last
week by a wide margin of 4-2, how-
ever the 'individual matches were
very close and with 9. slight im-
provement the Juniatians ma rove
dangerous. The Blue and Gol s icers
walloped Dickinson 3-1 early in the
season; so on paper they are heavy
favorites. Flory captains the Indians
and is said to be about the best on
the team. Harley Ellis and Angstadt
are the other men that are certain
to cause our boys some worry.

The varsity, however will have its
full stren h on thecourts and since
the oppos tion is not so tough should
make a creditable showing. Practice
has been somewhat irregular during
the past "week because the men
seemed stale from their tri East,
but the Bucknell match put hem in
ﬁrst rate condition for the coming
matches. '

The match with Tech will be
played on the Tech courts at two
o’clock tomorrow afternoon. The
Juniata match will be played on the
stadium courts Tuesday afternoon at

Recognition
 ND as the semester draws to a close, we pause
’ in our hustle and bustle in the ﬂurries before
ﬁnals, and pay some sort of tribute to those
' who have given the University a certain amount of
, service. -.
_ Naturally, the lists of tappings are not complete. No
glilt ﬁould ever be complete, for no single groups of
_: people can realize the work of those around them.
_ ffﬁecognition, therefore, comes to_those better known
’ who have done some task, large or small, in the scho-
 or extra-curricular activity ﬁeld.
, V» We can only stop and wonder, as we read, whether
“many who have done their humdrum duties in a less
conspicuous, less spectacular way, can ever rpceive
. their rewards.

"Nowsnd then in theevening when Mrs. Bascombe is not too
tired from cleaning, cooking, sewing (she makes ‘her own clothes,
and does it beautifully) or attending the Ladies’ Aid, she comes up
with her work to my-sitting room. She came last night carrying a
‘red woolen scarf. She chose a tall rocker and sank into it with a
‘sigh, leaning her dark head against the chair back.

I'm so tired. I've had a hard day.”

her just before she died. He was so pleased, for they were not
members of our church. It means so much to his success, getting

Mr. Bascombe thinks they would not have given him the funeral
if they hadn't meant to join our congregation.”
“Was this the child who was run over by a motorcycle?"
“No; she got well. Mr. Bascombe paid her nine visits in the
hospital. He is not fond of children, but those people are mem-
bers of our church,-—inﬂuential members; the father is chairman
of the parsonage committee. " I believe they will paper the house
now. It was such an opportunity to make a gopd impression! That
chairman was the only diﬁiculty—-a stingy, unreasonable man. Oh,
yes, this child died of appendicitis. The doctor did not "arrive
in time. It seems he had a bill unpaid.” ’
"What a brute!" » - ‘
“Oh, no; he’: a member of the Elm Avenue Church. It was
unfortunate, but he has his livng to make. He is young; he ‘must

be too soft-hearted. He must“ think ﬁrst-of success inﬂhis pro-

an hour late, with a group of spiri-
tuals of which the best done was
By“ an’ By. The second group by
the glee Club consisted of three re-
ligious songs. The third group by
the club contained such old favor-
ites as The Belle of St. Mary's,
Handel’: Where _'ere You Walk, and
The Staines Morris.

The piece do resistance of the
program, if one may call it such,
was Richard Kountz’s cantata The
American Ode. This was per-
‘formed by the entire club and the
-soloists. The work" was well sung,
but in itself is a very mediocre bit
of+’music._ The idea“ of an ode cele-
brating; American spirit is a good
idea,» but apparently; it meant little
"to" 'Mr.1Kountz.- While emptily im-
p'ress‘ive,. the composition contained
very little that was original. An-
other thought in connection with
this selection —-since when has
America’ become the national an-
them that one stands to sing?

The ﬁrst soloist of the evening
was Henrietta Bodycombe, pianist.
Her first selection, a Brahm's Rhap-
sody, and one in her second group,
Ravél’s_Jeua: d’eau, were the most
pleasing.

Rachmaninoff Serenade——but it's

" I Theother soloist was" Helen Bell
_Rus_hr,., one.» of thezwell-known singers
about town; Miss‘ Rush, sang a
group of modern songs of which
Campbell-Tipton’s'A Spirit Flower
was by ‘far the best. She was also

"the ,soloist in the~Kountz Ode.

_But“I ' see I have neglected to
mention the woman whose hard and
sincere‘: work made this fine concert
‘possible. That woman‘ is Mrs.
James H. Greene, the director.
Mrs; Greene's efforts have made a
real chorus from “just a bunch of
girls." And Mary Drum as ac-
companlstrdeserves much credit. In
fact, everybodyeamsd lots of it.

‘ "Kat and Skyscrapers, Frank

I-Iarling in Deep‘ River and A
Light from St. Agnes, Deems ‘Tay-
lor in parts of The Henchman, and
lots of other young composers have
 jazz themes and rhythms suc-
cessfully. In fact, the jazz of such
shows as Oh Kay and Funny Face
is much-preferable, from a musical
standpoint, than the sentimentality
of «the ones which have “charming
melodies.’

Jazz is here to stay, and although
much of what is“ ‘constantly benig
written is worthless, its inﬂuence is

* marked. Stokowski — and Toscanini,

to mention two well-known‘ conduc-
tors, are both patrons of jazz. Prac-

«tically every composer writing‘ in

America today has used jazz in some
phase or ‘other. Even children are
