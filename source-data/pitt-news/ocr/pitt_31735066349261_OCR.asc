WSGB Elections

  Campaign Restrictions Ease

BY BILL MOORE

Campaigning for the upcoming
Student Government Board (SGB)
elections will begin Friday under
much looser restrictions than in
past yearswvith a probably increase
in the number of candidates.

Q

The $10 registration fee for
candidates and the ban on parties
have been eliminated for the Jan.
21 and 22 election, and the

. . .€/‘Cluired number of petition signa-

‘tures has been cut in half.

The SGB rejected the recom-
mendation of the Student Govern-
ment. Election Committee (SGEC)
to retain‘ the $10 for board and
presidential candidates to help
defray the costs of running the
election.

SGB member Mark Satinoff, a
nrobablv presidential candidate in
this year 5 race, argued for the
elimination of thefee, saying the
cost restricts certain students from
running. A motion by Satinoff to
drop the fee passed, 4-2.

Satinoff also argued strongly for
complete elimination of the petition

_requirement. “Petitioning has no-

\

thing to do with a candidates
program or platform,” Satinoff
said. ' -A -

SGEC chairman. Lee -Moses
claimed the petitions could be
signed during the campaign
process and ,would ensure the
candidate spoke with the students.
“Any candidate who doesn’t want
to go out and speak with as much of
the electorate as possible wouldn't,
I think, be much of a candidate,”
Moses said. _

The board voted to retain the
petitions, approving an SGEC

Faculty Union Ruling

Delayed in Hdrrisburg  

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The State decision dividing the
University for the purposes of a
-‘faculty union election may be

 elayed, according to State Labor

Relations Board Secretary Harold
Light. There had been indications
the decision would be made today.
The ruling was expected to
ﬁnalize the size of the bargaining
units for faculty at Pitt, along with
decisions on the issue of inclusion
of chairmen and nonteaching
professionals in'a faculty union.
“All I can say is that it’_s not on
the official agenda as of right
now,” Light said last night, “It’s
not on the sheet but there’s always
the chance it could be entered
sometime tomorrow.“
Light did not elaborate on the
reasons for the delay, but said that
.as late as 5 last night the University
case had not been included on the
ofﬁcial agenda for today's Board

-."Q>s.ession.

A source close to the Labor
Board recently revealed that the
conﬁdential proposal now being
considered would divide ‘Pitt into
four areas for the election: one unit
each for the Law School, the
Medical School, the schools in the
health-related professions and the
schools remaining under the
‘provost.

Board decides to divide the campus
for a faculty union, election may

. prove to-be, the determining factor

in the contest, according to some
union_ spokesmen.

Since the bargaining unit ruling
will specify what faculty may vote
in the elections, and in how‘many
“communities of interest” "they
will be grouped, the decision will
have an effect on the strategy of
various unions in their heightening
campaigns for votes. 2

In another development, a new -.

faculty group has emerged in the
collective bargaining question. It is
composed of faculty who oppose

‘the idea of faculty unionization at

1_iSs.u.e-.2 . , 

Pitt. .

Calling itself the Teachers for an
Independent Faculty (TIF), the
group is investigating the alleged
beneﬁts and drawbacks cf faculty
unionization, according to TIF
spokesman Dr. Ned Arnett of Pitt’s
chemistry department.

“The ordinary person will make
a decision on faculty‘ unionization
on the basis of costs and beneﬁts,”
Arnett said. “The unions, of
course,-will tell them about the
beneﬁts. but- someone’ has to tell
them about the costs as well.

The TIF is not anti-union in a
strict sense, Arnett added, but is

simply, aiming to analyze _the_

impact of unionization on Pitt with
as many tools as possible. ‘

According to Arnett, ﬁnancing of
the TIF has come_only from faculty
members interested in supporting
research on the union question. ’

Also in‘ faculty union news,‘ the ,

University currently hasbpened an

Satinoff argued that contributors to
Socialist candidates in the past
have been harassed.

The board also approved the
SGEC’s recommendation to _re-
introduce the party system to
Student Government eledtions.
Any group of one presidential
candidate and up to four board
can_didates mayvregister and
advertise as a‘party, under the
revised election procedures.

’ As in previous years, the voting
will take place over a two-day
period, with voting booths in the
Cathedral, the Student ‘Union, the
Towers lobby, the Benedum Hall

lobby, and Scaife Hall.

At least four students unofﬁcially
have acknowledged plans to

campaign for president and a large ,

slate of Board candidates is
expected.

Housing Crunch Ecisecl  

‘BY DENNIS KELLY

There is ‘a shortage of
on-campus housing again this term
but last term’s problem of
discontented students being placed
in facilitiesoutside the University

has been alleviated, according to

Fred Fonseca, director of Resi- .

dence Life. V
“In preparing for fall term we
ﬁlled all the regular bed spaces we
have. At‘ that point we began
placing students in temporary
areas,” Fonseca said.
The University is equipped to
‘handle 3,512 students in existing
housing facilities. Lastterm can
additional 400 students needed
housing according '?o Don Hughes,
University housing director; '
Lounges in the nurse’s residence
were converted to living spaces and
double rooms in Holland Hall were
remodeled to accomodate three
persons. , _
Students also were placed in
dorms at'_Carlow College, Point

volumes from last semester to this
semester was caused by the
addition of 20,000 volumes previ-
ously in storage.

The new law building also will
provide room for more students
and faculty in Pitt’s Law School.

“We will eventually up our
enrollmentwto 650 students,” Sell
said, “We also expect some
increase in faculty.” According to
Sell, the Law Sc-hool also should
expect an increase in applications
with '-the completion of the new law
building. Sell said that he expects
the new building will make more"
people interested in coming to
Pitt's, Law School. _

Robert Harper, "Law -School dean
of admissions, agreed that the new
building will attract students to
Pitt. P

“It will‘ deﬁnitely help us in our

- admissions for people to see the

new Law School instead of the ]'4th

said, “With one of the ﬁnest law_

Though the student capacity of

the~school of law will increase, it p _ 3

“will not affect the admissions

“At the end of the term
additional space opened on campus
and we tried to eliminate some of
the temporary rooms," Fonseca
said.

“The lounges were the first
places to be cleared, then we began
ﬁlling other holes,” he added.

People placed outside the Uni-
versity were given the option to

{come back. A number of them did,

’ ""but some prefered to remain where

they were, according to Hughes.

“We now have about 72 female
students at Webster Hall, along
with 22 males. There are also 12
women at Carlow who opted to
remain there,” Hughes said.

“Only a dozen or so at Webster
Hall wanted to return. A They
seemed happy with the accomoda-

problems have arisen,” Fonseca
said.

Fonseca explained that the
University is making a decision on
the bidding for rooms next year. In
the past. top priority was given to
returning upperclassmen with
freshmen, relocated students,
transfers and commuters following.

There is a growing request every

year for returning students, espe-

cially for female students, accord-
ing to Fonseca, and some changes
in housing can be expected in the
future.

Hughes speculated. that Pitt will
have to expand its facilities but
for now there are no definite plans.

“We don't see much of a decline
in store for next year,” Hughes
‘said, “Certainly if the increasing
pattern of last year continues our
need for space will increase and

s_ome changes will be necessary.”

rates lower for commuting students

plaints, revealed in a. survey
conducted by the Commuter
Association‘ and published last
month. .

Of the 580 responses, 42.9%
rated the parking situation at Pitt
very poor. Most students
attributed the parking problem to a'

costs, and said a daily parking fee

A Cood Neighbor Policy

Though the major part of the University's physical expansion is over,
rumblings from various parts of the community still come up from time
to time. - , '

- Whether the complaints stem from noise in a school facility or lack of
upkeep on University grounds, it’s clear that Pitt has not yet earned the
status of a good neighbor. H

' While the University erects ediﬁces that cover the space of a sports

stadium, it seems incomprehensible that it doesn’t have the means to
_renovate_ the dilapidated. houses" it owns ingthe residential _
 _ . Thernsluggishness’ with which the University has respondedto the
appeals of citizens’ groups has become characteristic of its attitude
toward Oaldand and the people that live here.

While the administrators bought up tracts of land on which to

 ‘expand, the mission to educate formed a convenient shield behind

which they could hide. Now that the boundaries are somewhat
‘stationary, Pitt and Oakland residents are moving toward a period of
accommodation. » _
The old arguments no longer hold, and neither do the new ones.
A failure to respect the rights of the community on the part of the
University will only postponefriendly relations. ‘
_While Pitt’s public affairs administrators have for years been
- spewing forth rhetoric about a new phase in comminiity relations, we
have little tangible evidence of any change. Although Pitt is no longer
eating up whole blocks, it’s not returning anything to Oakland
residents either. i .
Bearded-up buildings with weeds in the yards don't make for pretty

J '‘ neighborhoods, and Pitt ofﬁcials who live on streets with such eyesores

,are as rare as a foot of snow in Pittsburgh.

Maybe a little more empathy on the part of administrators is
necessary for them to understand what it’s like for -some Oaklanders to
live next door to such aesthetic crimes. ’ » I

Promises and good intentions won’t make the burs and rotten wood‘
go away. But it’s high time ‘something did.

A Bowl Days at P°tt
The football Panthers have resurrected their standing as a national
power with the victory over Kansas in the Sun Bowl.

The  no doubt -means a myriad of things to those involved in the
season-long effort of developing a cohesive squad of players who now

, ﬁnd themselves ranked just outside the nation’s toughest dozen teams.

For the players, it means a crack at‘the_ Top Ten next year and the

  likelihood of a major bowl bid. Pitt football fans long have yearned for

Eastern dominance, which can come only throughlthe defeat of Penn
State. After coming within a hair’s breadth of it this year, the Panthers
have every reason to believe it'll be theirs next year. -

A For Coach Johrmy Majors and his staff, the Sun Bowl win means the
full realization of the goal of pride and enthusiasm in a team that has
reversed a decade of losing seasons. _ ‘ '

For Pitt .-in general, the success of the Panthers brings national
esteem,‘ additional applicants and even revenue. That brings usto a
disconcerting point. . ‘ - ‘ 

_ We hope the greatness ofthe football team does not foster the

administrative maneuvering that brought on the coupon system and i

' generated such‘ controversy. \ c
It needs to be reasserted that the Panthers play for students and
those in the Pitt’ community ﬁrst, the alumni and former affiliate
second, and ticketholding outsiders third. . e~ '

No matter how good or bad the playing is, this natural priority "

remains unchanged.
Football at Pitt must be kept in the proper prospective also. In the
, headlong rush to produce a winner, the University mustn't lose sight of
its basic education mission. I R ‘

College ‘sports are only as essential to. this school as the Franklin '.
Pangbom Film Societ_y’s and Student Union Board’s weekend films. S’

It should never be forgotten that raison d’etre of sports is
entertainment and that nationwide, many an educational program has

 been cut when ill-advised administrators saw it as something greater. I

The swift rise of ,the.Panthers is therefore not only a call to glory but
also a reminder that there are greater goals for this University,

We extend sincerest congratulations to Majors, his staff and the
team for making Pitt football the welcome diversion it now is. Their
prospects are probably the only thing that makes one‘ look forward

Who’s in charge here?

i The CIA Hits the Talkies

BY HAROLD BILOOMFIELDI

. “Ladies and gentlemen‘, we have

. with us today an assistant to the

director of the CIA, Mr. Robert
Bugger, on the Ned Newman
Show. Mr. Bugger has consented
to talk with us about alleged CIA-

involvement in domestic surveil- V

lance."

“Rubbish. Such a thing never
happened and never will.”

“Then you deny charges that the
Agency spied on anti-war activi-
sts?" V _

“Of course I do. Any American
has the right to voi_ce his opinion
about anything heiwantsto, in
anyway he wants to. Speaking of
raising your voice, did you.know._
that Jane" Fonda was areal quiet
kid? The first time she yelled at‘ her
dad was when he caught her and
this boy..." I it

‘‘We're on the air, you can't talk
about such things. Now it has been

’ said that the CIA was looking’ into

communist ties with resistance to‘

the Vietnam war."

“Horse feathers! How could
there be any communist ties if
Jerry Rubin and.Abbie Hoffman
never made or received an overseas
phonccall. Nor did they ever speak

with a foreign-sounding person on
the phone." ' 
“How did you know that?"
‘;‘Well...ah...statistics have
shown that those statements are
true of most Americans. That
explains‘ it, doesn’t it?"« ‘

“Well, we can pretty well see the
ClA"s involvementwith well-known
people. What about your ﬁles on
everyday, average Americans?"

“There are no such ﬁles. The
other day Iwas in the ﬁle room and

‘ lean safely tell you that there’s

nothing in ’ there ' out i of i the
ordinary. Regular stuff like
coups—for exaniple—how to stop

one (see Cuba), or how to start one

(see Chile). Most of the ﬁlesiare
like that." _ ._ . 
"Domesticsurveillance is bad

enough but interfering in other’s
people's civil wars is a disgrace."

“Look. our people just happen to

  

pick the wrong vacation spots at the
wrong times." X It
“I feel that those ﬁles you '

mentioned should be» made’pub-
lie."

“New-nian. those ﬁles are our
business. You've been nosing into
things for a long time. Like in
college, when you wandered into
the professor's office before the big
exam."

"Well folks it seems that our
time has just about run out."

“Why don't we talk about that
little waitress you met when your
wife was in the hospital? That was
almost as funny as your income tax
returns. for last year."

“I hope our little talkicleared up
suspicions in the minds of .our
listeners as well as it did in mine.

_Tune in tomorrow when our topic

will be: The pigeon, Friend or Foe?

r:Studerit Welcome

Forthe'PSEA

" In your editorial of December 3,
' 1975 _you expressed concern that

the_ “students would not be.

.represented at the table.when the

faculty sits down toibargain with
the administration. I agree that

' students have a vital interest in

what will go on at that table, but
unfortunately,Public Law 195 does
not permit students to take part in

appreciate that students may feel
that the gains the faculty will make
through collective bargaining will
come at their expense, literally.’

It should then reassure you to
know that this will not be the case if
the bargainin 21 cnt turns out to

be PSE /NE - ITT. The PSEA/
strongly supports V lower tuition
costs to students as well as

increased benefits for faculty. Does
this sound like pic in the sky? The
PSEA represents the faculty at the
state-o.\\'ned colleges in Pennsyl-
vania. Since Public Law 195 took

‘ effect in I970, and the faculties at

the colleges afﬁliatcd with PSEA,
faculty salaries at these institutions
increased roughly 40% while
tuition has increased 14%. Over
the same period, tuition at Pitt has
increased 17%. but faculty salaries
have lagged to the extent that
salaries are now act.ually lower at
Pitt than at Slippery Rock. How is
this possible? The answeris state
’appropriatioiis. The. state-owiicd

colleges have seen their appropiria-v ,

I can further '

tioiis increase 104% since 1971,.
while the appropriations for Pitt
have increased only 47%. PSEA’
_dcserves much of the credit for the
1I_1_Q1_‘e_aSe.- at the state-owned
colleges because of its lobbying in
Harrisburg on_ behalf of the
appropriations for them. PSEA will
be able to dothe same on behalf of
Pitt’s appropi‘iat_ions once they

V ifeprcseiit the Pitt faculty.

However, one must not suppose

‘that the PPU (AFT) or the AAUP

will be able to do the same in.
Harrisburg. PSEA has seven full
time lobbyists in Harrisburg, AFT‘
has two and the AAUP has none.‘
Nor can the AFL-CIO lobbyists be
couiiicd on to support the AFT, and
higher education in ‘particular,
because they are not a strictly
educational organization, as is the
PSEA. A recent poll ‘published in
the Philadelphia Inquirer; showed
that the «state le islators them-
selves perceived t c PSEA to be
the n_iost powerful lobbying force in
Hari'isburg. This is remarkable
when 'one considers that the
lobbyists in Harrisburg include the
Pitt administration. the AFL—CIO,
and niziiiy large corporations‘.

So itis clear that the students
should not fear faculty .un'ion'iza-_
tio_n.' but,shouldwclconie-it‘ and the
PSEA, in‘ ‘particular. PSEA will!

For Owl Photo

I would like to register a
complaint against the handling of
senior"pict'ures this year. -_Having
made arrangements for a sitting, -I
arrived wearing a sports jacket’ and
shirt——both appropriate for a
formal photograph. l was rudely
informed by the photographer that
I should “go home and put on a
decent‘ shirt.” By his deﬁnition,
“decent” meant a solid-color shirt,
an item I do not own.. . l .

Since the sitting fee is paid by
the student, I feel ,that color
combination and style should be
determined solely by the student.

Insigniﬁcant as it may.appear, this 

incident is representative of a
greater offense——-that being an
attack on my right of choice.

I just hope the photographer
reevaluates his deﬁnination. of
“decent." Otherwise many sen-
iors’ pictures will be absent from
next year's Owl. ~

Propaganda and the ERA

ﬁg, ln reference to the article in the

Pitt News of November 21. by Dan
Mulholland. we would like to
comment on his wonderful use of
propaganda and would like to
expose it as such.

First of all. if this is a free society
as he claims, then why are women
prevented from getting jobs they
qualify for. simply because of their
sex? It has always been said that
analogies make a poor argument.
Mulholland reinforces thisby his
poor use of equating the Prohibi-
tioni Act with the Equal Rights
Amendment.
refers to the fifth and fourteenth

protect the rights of women. He
also refers to “subsequent laws."
Where and what are they and why
aren't they being enforced?

The ﬁfth amendment deals only
with the rights of the accused in
criminal proceedings. The four-
teenth amendment deals only with
the rights of citizens in a very
general way, that is, life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness. It
also deals with the apportionment
of representatives to Congress,
persons disqualified from holding
offices, and the public debts.
Obviously, these are not sufficient.

Mulholland refuses to accept the
phenomenon of the single and

-»f_5§independent woman. His attitude

is typical of an egotist, everything
depends on him, especially women.
He further assumes that every
woman, if she has a husband and
kids, is “tied" down to them.
Mulholland also refers to
“mothers with young children
having to go off to war. Just as
there are exemptions from the
military for men, so ‘will there be
exemptions for women (as in the
above mentioned situation).

The article refers to the benefits
of being a homemaker and
housewife.’ What are the advan-

In the article, he‘

tages to being married to a house?
Granted. there are advantages to
being a homemaker. but there are
equal benefits in working outside
the home. The ERA would simply
give men and women a choice as to

,, their roles in life. It is a matter of

individual freedom to choose one's
own career, whether it be a
teacher, nurse, engineer, or
laborer. The ERA would guarantee
this to everyone.

Mulholland speaks of such
benefits as alimony and tax
deductions, when in reality women
are at many disadvantages. One
example of this is trying to obtain
credit———without your husband’s
signature. (For Mulholland’s
information, there is no alimony in
Pennsylvania.) Also, why should a
man dish out money to a woman
simply because they were married?
Unless, of course, she had no
marketable skills with which.to
support herself. —

What makes Mulholland think
that ‘simply because a woman
works outside the home that the
children will be neglected? We
would question the validity of his
statement that child-care centers
are “impersonal and dangerous.”

. When was the last time he was in

one of these? Also, has he never
heard of babysitters or the father

staying home? So many times
these centers provide better quality
care than the home environment.
Numerous studies have shown that
there are many advantages in
having a child exposed to child care
centers. not the least of which
being interaction with other child-
dren of rich and varied back-
grounds.

Mulholland's remark about se-
parate facilities is not only totally
unfounded. but totally irrelevant.
Using the. University as an
example, co-ed floors (not bath-
rooms) are being implemented and
are satisfactory to many. There are
still. for those who so desire it.
single-sex’ housing. The ERA will
have no effect on this.

Churches will in no way be
“harrassed" as Mulholland states.
This is due to a law upon which our

. constitution is based, separation of
’church and state.

It is most obvious that Mulhol-
land has not read the ERA or he
would be aware that it does not
have any direct influence on the
abortion controversy.

The mass media is dedicated to
revealing both sides of ‘issues as

. stipulated by the fairness doctrine.

Consequently, there is no basis for
Mulholland’s statement: “The

seeing one side of the issue."

We are shocked and appalled in
reading that a supposedly intelli-
gent college student would be
influenced so greatly by such
unjustified claims. We can only
hope that he and all others who

BY BILL MOORE

A recommendation to increase
the Student Emergency Loan Fund
by $15,000 over the next three
fiscal years has been drawn up by
three vice Chancellors to correct the
depletion of loan funds due to

_ defaults and increasing enrollment.

Student Government Board

(SGB) President Larry Platt was
_ notiﬁed of the recommendation by

Vice Chancellor for Business and
Finance Joe Dutton, in conjunction
with Vice Chancellors Jack Free-
man (Planning and Budget) and‘
Alfred Moye (Student Afﬁars).

The announcement was made by
Platt at the SGB meeting yester-

(day.

Platt said the agreement was
made as an offshoot of the SGB

attempt to gain control of interest
generated from the Student Activi-
ties Fee. after the administration
said it would not be possible to give
the interest to the SGB.

“The money will go directly to
the students. It won't be eaten up
by administration costs, but will
still be in the hands of the
administration,” Platt said,
plaining the compromise.

In a letter to Platt, Dutton said

6X-

the funds, if separately invested, "

would generate approximately
$5,000 per year, the amount that
would now be shifted to the Loan
Fund.

Dutton explained a direct alloca-
tion of the $5,000 to the SGB
budget would be impossible, citing
the administrative costs incurred in
collecting the activities fee.

Also at Tuesday’s meeting, the
Board argued over responsibility
for an approximate $200 phone bill
consisting, according to SGB
member Mary Schwarz, of long-
distance calls made on the SGB
phones by the Student Coalition
Against Racism (SCAR).

SGB member and SCAR organi-
zer Mark Satinoff said in response,
“In my opinion, SCAR should pay
for some, but not all, of those calls.
Some of those calls were made by
myself as an official representative
of the Board.

“I consider my activities in the
anti-racist movement- as my legiti-
mate duty as an SGB member.”

The Board voted unanimously
that SCAR pay 50% of the long

Aid Office Releases
Information Pamphlet

BY CONNIE GIEL

_ Trying to defray the inevi-
table, traditional panic of penniless
students who stampede the Stu-
dent Aid Ofﬁce every year, the aid
ofﬁcers have culled a bite-sized
pamphlet of igeneral—-that is,
essential——information from the
formidable official aid booklet.

Aid Officer Debbie Rupert said
students should observe the
deadline dates and complete all the
required forms. The pamphlet,
bright orange like its (full-length
form, lists the deadlines on the
front cover.

Freshmen must apply for aid by
Feb. 1, and upperclassmen by
April 1. All students filing for the
springand summer sessions should
apply by March 1.

These are _deadlines, Rupert
stressed, and students who can ﬁle
earlier should do so to ensure
prompt, correct processing.

Aid application forms should be‘

ready for distribution by Feb. 1,

Rupert said._ A completed package '_
consists of a Parents’ or Student-’»s

Conﬁdential Statement, at student

‘ ‘ i —an irate Star Trek fan

 

BY KEN MINARIK

Though nearly a month has
passed since Pittsburgh’s ﬁrst Star
~_ Trek convention, thousands of irate
4 fans are calling for the heads of the" '

‘ convention’s organizers.. — -
The “Pittsburgh Star Trektacu-
- , lar,” ‘billed by its creators as the
 ﬁrst Star Trek convention in this
’ area of the country, was plagued by
 problems of overcrowding, of a lack
_1 of facilities and of a noticeable lack
 of stars.
’ ’ With all its shortcomings, one
W thing the convention did not lack
‘was fans. .An estimated 6,000

 three-day convention. With tickets
' ‘ at the door going for $15 and
dozens of vendors ﬁlling the rooms

The Saturday-night
costume party,‘ billed as the
highlight of the convention, was
little more than an apex 'of
_calamity—it was held in the
seventh floor hallway.

The chairman of the “Pittsburgh
Star Trektacular,” Nanci Hoy,
often was noticeable absent from
the convention. None of the
event’s "organizers would answer
questions from the press concern-
ing the convention’s financial

"success, which. led one irate

reporter to remark that “Silence is
golden, and so is Star Trek.”,

The event was not without
entertainment. Throughout the
convention, three Star Trek epi-
sodes and blooper films, were
shown continuously in smoke-filled
rooms with as many as 75 people
packed into one hotel room. A lack
of projectionists was’ solved by
pulling volunteers out of the hall.

James Doohan (Engineer Scott)
was the first Star Trek cast member
to make an appearance at the
convention. Thousands of fans
waited for hours in a single-ﬁle line
to get his autograph, while
thousands of others simply couldn’t

and greying beard helped hide

 Gay Hotline Opened

, V The Gay Students at Pitt (GSP)
established a hotline last semester
to make information about homo-
sexuality available to the Univer-
sity community. .
“We are strictly an information
service,” said Roger Manahan, a
spokesperson for the GSP Hotline.
Manahan stressed the hotline is not
‘a dating service, but that a caller
will be provided with information
about places to meet other gays.
Most callers have questions
. about GSP and other’ gay organiza-
. _ tions in the area where social
functions are held. “People want
to know of places to meet and
socialize with gays," Manahan
said. “Some have questions about
gay bars."
To meet the needs of callers, the
GSP has compiled an index.
' Included are social locations, area

bars, gay functions and places .
where counseling can be obtained. -
“We try not to counsel people on
sexual questions, but we recom-
mend meetings and groups where. a
caller's problems can be worked

on," Manahan said.

The hotline is open every‘
Tuesday night between _7 and 11
p.m. Servicing the phone are GSP
members, who have been receiving
three to four calls per week.

GSP feels the hotline has been
successful and it may be expanded
this semester to include Wednes-
day and possibly Thursday nights.

“The calls we receive encompass

‘more than just the. University
ccommunity." Manahan said.

He
called the service a “clearinghouse
of information about _the gay
community in Pittsburgh." ‘

If a one-word description was

“commercialism” fits the bill
nicely. .While the organizers of the

Undercover Repoﬁler‘

"I

At Christmas time, people's
hearts are supposed to melt like
snowﬂakes on a child’s tongue.
Putatively. Scrooges become ﬁlled
with generosity and kindness and
people take time out to count their

blessings rather than their spare‘

change.

For some reason, I never really
believed all this happens at
Christmas time. Sure, there are
always a handful of people who get
ﬁlled with the Christmas spirit.
They stand on snow-covered street
corners with bare feet , holding out
their hands to collect pennies for
orphans and Vietnameses refu-
gees.

But what about the common

year hunting for Christmas bar-
gains? I had a strong suspicion
they would ﬂick ashes into the
hands of a charity worker before
they dropped a coin into them.

Two days before Christmas, as cold
winds whipped through the streets
of downtown Pittsburgh. I walked
into the warmth of the Salvation
Army headquarters.

These Salvation Army people
were -probably a bunch of Scrooges
too. I muttered to myself as I
climbed the stairway. They were
probably nothing but fat-paunched
businessmen and heavilv ieweled
wives of neurosurgeons, who put

‘ in time for charity in order to claim

immense deductions on their tax
forms. ' .

“Hi. I'm May. Pleased to meet
you." . '

I was confronted by a tiny old
lady-who looked like she had seen

more years than Gerald Ford had

,seen tumbles on theski slopes.

She wore a neatly pressed blue
uniform, -military fashion, and a
starched white shirt.

May extended an ancient vein-
covered hand and shook mine
ﬁrmly. ‘‘It’s very good of you to
volunteer to collect for the
Salvation Army,” she said. “A lot
of poor children are going to have a
nice Christmas,_ thanks to you.” 1

Poor children? I had always
thought this money went toward
ﬁnancing a gala Salvation Army
beer blast on New Year’s Eve. It
was good to ﬁnd out there were still

-a few people who knew Christmas
was a time for generosity.

After I donned the traditional
Salvation Army outﬁt_——long black
trenchcoat and an ofﬁcer’s cap with
a badge on it—May handed me a
little gold bell and a red bucket.
“Good luck,” she said as I walked

There was one way to ﬁnd out.

Melting Hearts of Scrooges

out of the door.

In no time, I was planted in front
of Kaufmzmifs department store
ringing my bell furiously.
Occasionally. I peaked cautiously
out from_under the brim of my hat
to make sure I wasn't spotted by
any friends. casual acquaintances,
or enemies.

Fifteen minutes passed. and not
a cent had been dropped into my
bucket. Just as I had expected.
These people were so cheap they'd
sell ' their grandmothers for a
handful of...

“Thank you ma'am. Have a nice
Christmas.” Someone had drop-
ped a quarter in my bucket.
Granted it wouldn’t buy a poor
child even a tube of airplane glue
for Christmas. But at least it was a
start.

Before long, the bottom of my
bucket began to disappear under a
thick layer of coins and bills. There
were at least one hundred quarters, ~
a handful of dollar bills, andz..what
was that? Some cheapskate had
thrown a Canadian dime into my
bucket. Bah. humbug.

Then I saw her. A little
15-year-old beggar from one of
those crazy Oriental religions-
Hare Krishna, I think. She would
run up to unsuspecting shoppers,
pin a two-cent candy cane on their
lapels. and demand a dollar
contribution. '

“Sir, would you like to donate
some of your money to-me?” the
little urchin asked, peering wide-
eyed into my bucket of money.

The nerve of her! First she
scared away my business, then she
demanded my money. I quickly

shooed the rascal away. She looked
back at,me with large. sad eyes. I
snarled at her. . . ~

“Thank you, sir. I hope you have
a good Christmas," I said as a
gentleman dropped a check for $10
into my pot.

After a quick break to gulp down
a supposedly hefty lunch of an

;Arby’s Roast‘ Beef sandwich,

French fries and a coke, I returned

- to my spot.

Unbelievable. An entire high-
school band had set up 20 feet from
my post. It was bad enough they
were collecting for the School .for
the Blind and stealing my business,
but to top it off, they-sounded like a
herd of water buffalo being led into
a tar pit. I had no choice. It was
time for my'se.cret weapon. '

BY M.C. PILECKI

 ,'Hollywood. has given out is

Christmas gifts this season, and,
rdependingi upon which ﬂick you
~-picked, you wound up with a
 bauble or a piece of coal in your

stocking. ‘ -

. ' Very probably the top movie of
5 _the season is the ﬁlm adaptation of

' Ken Kesey's 1962 novel, One Flew’
7~Oyer The Cuckoo’s Nest. Needless
T] to say, in the time/ cultural gap and
"necessary condensation, there's
’ quiteaa bit lost in the translation.
“There's also a certain amount of

mixed feelings involved.

L‘ The original was a poignant tale

' about a modern day hustler-cum-
Christ figure who lands in a mental
hospital and teaches the inmates of
the world how to unite and get their
S respective acts together, the basics
Z of which are not lost on ﬁlm. As
well.as being viciously misogynis-
tic, the novel was bravely individu-'
'alistic, -but ﬁlled with a Kafkaesque
 horror that could hardly fail to

inspire, paranoia. The mental

— hospitallwas a perfect microcosm of
— a society that reduced men (gender
.. intentional) to various stages of
I ' pitiable helplessness. ,
‘ .» Time, feminism, and--mored_real-
 istically;-a need to shorten the
whole thing, drastically blunted the
 -lmisogynistic edge of the story. The
_ movie chooses instead, to point the
« ﬁnger” at authority in general--and
, only a few women’ in particular.
’ , This ‘watering down has .also
’ ;'_ affected the horror aspect of the

hatred, and certainly not terror.

Cuckoo’s Nest is a ﬁlm full of
feeling and rich images, touching
upon emotions running the old
gamut of pleasure and pain. It can
cause one to -laugh, and to think,
And any movie that can do that
deserves a round of applause.

"And for those whosimply want to
laugh, there's a new comedy_that

' provides at least a few chuckles,
The Adventures of -Sherlock
Holmes’ Smarter Brother.

The comedy is quite spotty, but
has three good things going for it:
Gene ;Wilder, Madeline Kahn and
Marty Feldman. The same trio

madedlast year's Young Franken-
. stein a success, and now endeavor '

todo the same.for a young Holmes.
Wilder (who also ‘ wrote’ Young
Frankenstein) combines his acting
and writing talents here with his
directing debut and not alwayscwith
great success. ‘ ,
Part of the problem is a devotion
to a rather confusing mystery plot,
which involved a dance hall singer
(Kahn) in— the theft of a very
important document. The crime, of
course, is backed by that nefarious

Holmes nemesis,’ Professor Mori-.-

arty, dealing with a questionable
Italian opera star (Dom DeLuise).

, For reasons that seem necessary

only to continue the movie,
Sherlock has decided to involve his
young brother Sigerson (Wilder),
‘who holds his sibling in such
contempt that he calls him “Sheer
.Luck.” -
Anothe problem is_the weakness
of the characters. Only —Feldman‘s
character, a Scotland —Yard man
with a photographic memory, is
comic without ever being foolish or
unsympathetic. He also has the
talent to be funny without trying
very hard.

Kahn does try pretty hard in .a'

son does embody McMurphy, a role that calls for a rather nararow

hustler who gets himself placed
into the hospital looking for an
easier life and more pigeons to
pluck, and ends up acting the hero.

Louise Fletcher's nerse Ratched

features to create some humor. But '

anyone else in the movie. As comic .

comes across less as a malevolent - heroes go, he's ‘ not very heroic.-

,of the album should not be

misconstrued, however. “The
Romantic Cello” refers not only to
Solow’s romantic style of playing
but to the Romantic style prevalent
in most of the nineteenth century.

Many of the" pieces chosen for
this album were originally written
for either piano or violin and later
transcribed for the cello. Two of
the works are best known as songs,
the “Vocalise” and “Il Pleure
Dans Mon Coeur."

“Pezzo Capriccioso, Opus 62"
by Tchaikovsky alternately plung-
ed, dived and turned soulful. This
was just a taste of the superb
material to come. “Nocturne” by
the same composer contained
tremendous depth of feeling in
chromatic scales toward the end of
the piece.

Ernest Toch wrote “Impromptu”
for Piatigorsky (cello maestro)_

-honoring his 63 year birthday
- celebration.

Solow’s talents as
arranger make themselves evident

in his version of a work containing

tricky runs, double stops and
challenging, liquid movements. ‘

The Loch Ness Story,
by Nicholas Witchell.
Penguin Books, 156 pp., $2.25.

There was a time when the Loch
Ness Monster ranked with such

Triangle, .and UFOs. Curiously
enough, that time wasn't so long

about 15 knots. Mv estimation of
the length of the part of it we saw
would be about 20 feet, and it was
standing three feet or so out of the
water. The wash it created caused

our boat to rock violently..."

Witchell' mentions another

observer describes the creature's
head:

in abits the loch, the excitement
surrounding the animals still
abounds.

But wait a minute, you say, I
didn't know there was proof.

Nicholas Witchell presents a
fascinating narrative of the history
of the “myth,” bringing together
interesting accounts of both scien- '

Yet for all its vivid prose, the
book's most valuable feature is its
32 pages of photographs of the

The Kinks Present Schoolboys
in Disgrace,- The Kinks.
RCA Records, LPLI-5102
The «Kinks are still very. much

think up a better word for it), as
this album clearly shows.
An all but beaten band after their

  The Theatre Division

announces

early success with punk rock, the
Kinks attempted a long-needed
transition. embodied in the new
style of songs like “Lola" and
"Apemanj." '

They abandoned Top Forty
altogether and tried to attain
greater stature with a concept
album, Preservation Act I. The
group and its buyers were terribly
satisﬁed, so on came Preservation

‘Act II.

Here is yet another concept
album, this one revolving around
the theme of education and all the
bullies and mean principals that go
with it.

The Kinks have a hard time
hiding their second_-rate band
status, or else this album very well
could have meant something to
them and us.

The music is well-arranged;
melodic themes are submerged,
then recur, as they should on these
concept records, but the develop-
ment is flat and extremely
commercial. Practically any song
on the album could fare well on AM
radio—not that that's particularly
wrong. just that it saysjsomething
about to whom the thing's geared.

“I'm in Disgrace" sounds like
Alice Cooper. and that’s oneoflead
singer Ray Davies’ pitfalls. It's
hard to break out of a mold into
which listeners put you, simply
because you sound: like another
singer or another group. But that's
competition. '

Much of the album is influenced
by Fifties music, which the Kinks
pull off with the best of mimicry.
They never allow their parody to
dominate, however, and that shows
a degree of artistic restraint.

“Schooldays" and “Headmas-
tcr" are genuinely good songs.
Their lyrics are trite, but the band
lays with an element of seriousness
that otherwise is rare here. A few
more layers of development and a
little climax would have served the
group well.

The most intricate piece on the
album is Ray Davies’ tribute to
education. entitled “Education."
He serves up seven minutes of
harmonic power, simple but
balanced, like middle-Beatles. The
time changes; ‘choruses come in,

 weave out, then speed to a finish.

“No More Looking Back" uses
the same device, only on a smaller
scale. The strength in this one‘ is
therefore more concentrated.

“Finale” isn't a ﬁnale, but
merely a reprise from ,“Educa-
tion," and it seems the Kinks
didn't-know quite how to end the
record, so theytacked this on.

lt's nothing to write home about
for user them, but an interesting
and at times pleasant morsel to
savor in between repeated playings
of other, more accomplished
musicians. ' ’

Although the question is not
directly related to commuting, the
survey asked students if they felt
professors should be evaluated by
their students. More than 89% said
yes, and 66% said the results of the
evaluations‘ should be published
regardless of the professor's
wishes.

Among other problems listed by
a large number of the commuters
were traveling time, expenses.
inability to meet people, lack of
involvement, inconvenient class-
scheduling, lack of informaiton and
traffic.

In its conclusions, the CA
suggested remedies to the prob-
lems cited in the study survey.

. On parking, the Association
recommended that parking lots
under University control be open to
all faculty. staff and students and
that spaces be allocated on" a
first-come, ﬁrst-served basis. The
CA also asked that car pools be

given priority in parking lot spaces,‘

In response to commuters being

unable to attend programs, the CA’
offered the simple suggestion that
more programs be scheduled
during the daytime.
’ “To do,,_this,” the report read,
“it will take a concerted effort by
the people that plan the programs
and those who allocate money. It is
necessary for the program-
planners -to be sensitive to
commuter needs.”

CA President Larry Chaban is
using the survey to point out the
problems to the people who can
act on them, he said.

Chaban has planned a meeting
with University parking coordina-
tors and representatives of PAT,
and said he has already met some
success in convincing program-
planners to accomodate more
commuters.

“As.°-- shown by the survey,”
Chaban said, “the people who did
respond are apathetic, but they are
a little less apathetic than other
people because they vote and fill
out surveys. But they still aren’t all
that active on campus.” ’

Adversity ls Theme

BY TOM HALL
f Sports Editor

Upon examination of the 3-7
won-lost record, you might term

,the 1975-76 Panther basketball
- ‘campaign a losing effort. But you
. couldn’t call Coach Tim Grgurich

-and his players losers.
Perhaps the best way to deal
with adversity is to confront it. But

f how do you confront the loss of Mel
‘ Bennett and the disqualification of

lKelvin Smith? How do you heal a
broken wrist and a damaged knee?

4 UHow can you finish a 40-minute

‘basketball game with only four
players? How can you win
basketball games giving the
opposition an average of 6.5 points

‘ per game at the free throw line?

Recounting the past month’s
efforts on the hardcourt would be a
chilling experience for any Panther

’- fan. But there have been some

interesting developments ﬁltering

 down from the Fitzgerald Field-

house.

i 'First there was Ohio University
on Dec. 13. With the Panthers
trailing by a point with four
seconds remaining, Tom Richards

_i bombed a 40-foot desperation shot

at the buzzer to give the Panthers a
72-71 ‘win, in "a "game played so
raggedly by both squads, it hardly

' ' v met NCAA -standards. For the time

being, the Panthers had beaten the
Grim Reaper. Their luck soon ran

 Out”.

In’ the Big Sun Invitational in

" Florida ', the Panthers faced their

biggest test of the young season in
i_.ninth,-ranked Alabama and All-
American center 6-10 Leon Doug-
las. The Panthers responded to the
challenge, drawing to within three
points of the Crimson Tide with
less than three minutes to play.
But the bottom fell out of their
gallant effort, 62-53. They fared as
badly in the consolation game,
losing to Southern Florida, 70-63.
Back to the friendly Fieldhouse.
Down but not out, and dragging
their 2-5 record behind them, the

Panthers hoped to mop up on _

Evansville. They needed some
conﬁdence, just a touch of poise
and a win to get their feet back on
the ground.

_ What they did was shoot an
incredible 29% from the floor, as
the Fieldhouse win streak of 27
games came to an abrupt halt. The

' Panthers lost to Evansville, 62-61.
If all this wasn’t enough, the
beleagured Grgurich had another
problem. It seems that seven of the

 

I I Of Panther Basketball

on their excursion in Florida. The
result was a one-game suspension.
Four of the seven starters: Larry
Harris, Willie Kelly, Ralph Mc-

V Clelland and Frank Boyd.

With 6-5 Terry Knight, the
tallest Panthers starter, the game
against Cleveland seemed hope-
lessly stacked against Pitt. Not so,
as the Panthers makeshift lineup
played its hearts out, losing~the
contest, 60-56. The problem was
that the Panther travel squad for
the game had only seven players,
including three walk-ons. Three

players fouled out, leaving only-

four to finish the ﬁnal few minutes.
Cleveland State raised its record to
2-8 and proved that it is the worst
2-8 team in the NCAA.

Part "of the problem facing the
Panthers as they near the halfway
mark in the campaign seems to be
the lack of scoring. (No joke, folks).

El Paso, Texas...Maybe they
should have called it the Kansas
Turkey, or how about the Kansas
Chicken or—yes, the Kansas
Whatever it was, It
certainly wasn’t the mighty bird
that was supposed to pick apart the
Panthers in the 41st Sun Bowl. The
Cats won, 33-19, in a contest that
wasn't as close as the score
indicated.

“We came out here to have
fun," said Head: Coach Johnny
Majors after the game. “We knew
what we had to do though and we
just went out and did it.”

_ From the start, it seemed the
Hawks were going to beat
themselves as they were penalized
again and again. On the third play
of the game, quarterback Nolan
Cromwell, a converted defensive
back who led I the Big Eight
Conference in rushing, kept the
ball and swept the left side. Before
being tackled, he supposedly
pitched the ball to teammate
Laverne Smith, who blew past the
Panther defenders for a quick six.
Unfortunately for Kansas fans, the
toss was ruled an illegal forward
pass, erasing the-go-ahead tally.

On its second possession, Pitt
got on the boards. With a second
down and ﬁve at his own 40,

quarterback Robert Haygood, a
surprise starter, pitched the ball to
Elliott ,Walker, who broke three
tackles and, after a great downﬁeld

nder Sun (Bowl)

block by center Mike Shaffer, went
in for a 60-yard touchdown. Carson
Long kicked the point after and the
quarter ended with the Panthers on
top, 7-0.

It was a penalty again that gave
Pitt its next score. Near the end of
the initial quarter, Kansas was
awarded a 15-yard no-no for
unnecessary roughness following a
punt. giving Pitt the ball on the
Kansas 35. With Walker getting
eight and “The Hopewell ';Ex-
press" Tony Dorsett chugging for
13 additional, it was ﬁrst and goal
at the eight.

TD went in on the next play but
the point after was blocked,
bringing back the awful memory of
another blocked extra point a few
weeks earlier. But this time it just
wouldn't matter.

With 26 seconds left in the first
h_alf, the Panthers again went for
the Jayhawks’ throat._ On 11 plays
starting at the Pitt 49 following yet
another Kansas error——this time a
fumble—Haygood moved to the
two, from where Dorsett scored his
second touchdown of the day. The
score was 19-0 at the half.

As was to be anticipated with Pitt
ahead so far, the third quarter
won’t go down in the NCAA’s
record books for one of the best
ever played.

“We were in control at the half,”

Majors said. “But in the third
quarter, we ran into a lull of sorts.

~ We weren't in command.”

Behind Cromwell keepers and
halfback Smith sweeping the ends
plus a fumbled kickoff by Pitt’s
Gordon -Jones, the Hawks were on
the Pitt 32. '

But that was as far as they were
to get—at least for the time being.

It was fullback Norris Banks who
had the honors of carrying the
pigskin across the goal for the glory

fo the Big Eight when, on a ﬁrst‘

and 10 on his own 45, he blew
through the line .and outraced
Panther defenders for the six-

pointer.

The fourth quarter was made up .3
of a lot of scoring, with the teams‘. .-

taking turns. When it was over,
the Panthers had their first bowl
victory since the 1937 Rose Bowl.
when they defeated Washington.
21-0.

“Our defense played a great
game." said the happy Majors
after being thrown into the locker
room showers. “The offense

- played well, too, despite the layoff

which took their timing away, but

things went generally well.

For All-American Dorsett, who,
picked up 142 yards on the day, it
was fun all the way.

“For the first few days, we
didn't have any curfew and were
pretty much on our own. But as
things got closer to game time, we
all knew what had to be done.

“We didn't do anything different
out there; we just executed well.
When we do that, there isn’t a
team in the country we can't stay
with.”

With 18 of 22 starters returning
next year, plus the starting kicker
and punter, Dorsett’s words could
very well be truth itself.

Panthers Seek Revenge

BY JIM SPANOS

They call it a rivalry, but it is
generally recognized as a war. Not
your typical tanks and jeeps war,

but a Pitt-West Virginia matchup is z

a war nonetheless. The two

Terry has shown good strength under the boards -for the maligned

Panthers. _
They have only three players
shooting over 45%. Panther fans
have to be wondering just how
much they squad needs Keith Starr
back in the lineup.

Starr, who injured a knee in a
pre-season game, has yet to see
any action this year. ‘It was
announced that he has turned down:
a medical red-shirt, which would
extend his eligibility for another

year, andl can’t say I blame him.

He’s hoping to be ready for Notre
Dame on Monday, but as time
passes, it appears more and more
likely that Starr may never play in a
Panther uniform again.

‘ TICKETS FOR WVU GAME

Exchange tickets for the Pitt-
West Virginia basketball game will
be required for admission to the
game. They maybe picked up at
the  ticket 0ff1C6.- f -

combatants involved this evening_

atthe Pitt Field House are the
respective basketball teams of the
University of. West Virginia and of
the University of Pittsburgh, and
like so many of the contest that
have taken place between these
two schools, it’s likely to be pure
mayhem before the night is over.

The Panthers enter the battle-

ﬁeld with a 3-7 slate, and because V

their 28-game home winning streak
was broken in a disconcerting loss
to Evansville, they’ll be working on
increasing their current at-home
streak to two. Buffalo fell victim to
the Panthers by an 18-point margin
on Jan. 3. i

In light of all the unfavorable
publicity Coach Tim Grgurich and
the Panthers had received in the 10
days before the Buffalo game, it
was a much-needed win for at least
two reasons.

First, it provides Pitt__with some
momentum as it begins the most
rigorous segment of the schedule.
The next 12 dates on the basketball
schedule consist of games at
George Washington, Marquette,
Virginia, Rutgers, Cincinnati and
West Virginia, home games
against Notre Dame, Temple,
Syracuse, and South Carolina,-and
games against Pennsylvania and
Penn State at the Civic Arena.
That’s some mighty‘ respectable
opposition. And the Panthers are
quite aware of it.

_ Second. rumors had abound-ed
that there was a morale problem
on the squad.

Grgurich adamantly. denied the
rumors, but noted that players felt
they had to prove to the public that
there was no such problem.
“Buffalo was really a pressure ball
game for us,” he said.

West Virginia historically, has
been a formidable foe for Pitt,
regardless of its record. The
Mountaineers always play beyond
their .potential, itseems, when in
the Field House. And when Pitt
crosses the. border and plays in

infamous West Virginia Coliseum, V

it’s like they're walking into a
lions’ den armed with a slingshot.
, Last year, in the opening round
of the Eastern Collegiate Athletic
Association playoff, the most
bizarre ever of all the contests
between the schools took place.
The Mountaineers upset the
Panthers, 75-73, and there was
little doubt the ‘referees had an

3*‘



unusual hometown bias. When the,-.j

Panthers’
West Virginia player ' on the
backside in a friendly manner after
a WVU player had scored a bucket,
he was charged with a personal
foul.

And everybody remembers Jack
Fleming. the WTAE sportscaster
who also broadcast West Virginia
basketball games, pounding his fist
on the table and shouting “Beat
the hell out of Pitt.” His colleague
Bill Hillgrove, who does the Pitt
play-by-pay on WTAE. called it
unprofessional in nature, while a
group of Pitt rooters prepared to
hang Fleming. and not in efﬁgv.

All that is in the past, but if you
want to understand what transpires
tonight. or is likely to, it’s»
necessary to understand what
occurcd last year.

This year, the only West Virginia
player not returning from last
season's team is Jerome Anderson,
so the cast of characters remains
the same. One newcomer for the
Mountaineers still to be initiated
into this classic confrontation is

6-11 freshman center Julius Lewis,
who has seen some action this year.
V "Wonderful" Warren Baker, a
6-7 forward who averaged 16 points
per game last year, is one of
several Mountaineers who pose an
offensive threat to the Panther
cagers. Joining Baker in the startig
lineup will be ex-Albert Ballatin
star Stan Boskovich, a forward

whose most impressive games was~~,3§\—;._;_

against Davidson last year; he
poured in 40 points in that one.

(Continued from Page 16)

Ernie Hall, a 6-0 guard, Tony
Robertson, a 6-5 playmaker guard
who scored 20 points in the West
Virginia victory over Syracuse on
Saturday, and 6-0 sophomore
forward Maurice Robinson round
out the starting lineup.

Unlike their foes, the Panthers
will sport some new faces tonight.
Oh, Larry Harris ‘and'Tom Richards
have some memories -of last year’s
ﬁasco, but starters Terry Knight.

 Scott Nedrow, and Ralph McClel-

land are newcomers to the starting
lineup. Harris continues to pace the
Panthers in scoring with a 22
points-per-game average, and Mc-
Clelland leads the team in
rebounds.

“They can move the ball,"
McClelland said. “We know
they're noted for their offense more
than for their defense, and I'm
looking forward to it."

Despite the Panthers’ off-year
thus far, McClelland has some
positive feelings about the season.

“We've been in every game so
far," he continued, remembering
that the Panthers greatest margin
of defeat has been 10 points against
in the Steel Bowl.
“What's happened recently has
really brought this team together, a
lot more than most people think.

“Buffalo was the best game of
the year in that we put it together
both offensively and defensively.
We have more to prove now than
we did last year."

Indeed, they do. Especially
tonight. Each game during the next
two months is going‘ to be a
pressure cooker, each signiﬁcant in
its own way.

The key to the game tonight will
be how well Pitt is able to break the
stingy West Virginia zone defense:
Pitt has had some serious problems
with the zone at times this var, but
against Buffalo the Panthers
showed some ability to break it.

“At times this year, we haven't
been alert offensively," Grgurich
noted. “But I think that we’ve
found ourselves recently.

“Many of our problems have
come about because many of the
players on the team hadn't played
together very much before this
year, but they're working together
better now. I know the rest of the
schedule is difﬁcult, but this is
what we're looking for."

What the Panthers will also be

' lookingfor is some good shooting

from guards Richards, Bob
Shrcwsbury, Frank Boyd, Pete
Strickland, and Scott Nedrow, and
forwards Hararis, McClelland,
Terry Knight, Willie Kelly, Wayne
Talbott and Wayne Williams. If the
points are not forthcoming, it could
be interesting.

The Russians are here.

Yes, two so—called clean, dedica-
ted and sacriﬁcing bands of
Russian “amateur” hockey players
have invaded the United States and
Canada to take on eight dirty,

cocky and lazy teams of National . -

Hockey League professionals in
what is being billed as “Super
Series '76."

Well, that’s according to the
Russians, whose only hopeis that
the influence from our profession-
als will not rub off and hurt their
type of players. ~ ' '

We’ve all heard about the
Russians, and their play so far has
reinforced what everyone has
believed for years——the Russians
are very good.

The Soviet-North American bat-
tle began in 1972 when a
contingent of NHL stars, known as
Team Canada, battled the Reds in
an eight-game series. The
Canadians were expected to win
every game, but came away_
reevaluating their abilities with the
skin of their teeth.

Down 1-3-1 in the series, Team
Canada had to rely on the heroics of
Paul Henderson to pull out
victories in the ﬁnal three games,
the last coming on a Henderson
goal with seconds remaining.

North America saw several
Russian stars in the Series when
they led the Soviets to a series
victory over the,World Hockey
Association's version of Team
Canada two years later.

Alexander Yakushev is now
regarded by many as the greatest
left winger in all hockey. He is
followed by fellow Soviet Valery
Kharlamov, before Canada's Bob-
by Hull. Also emerging was a ﬁne
goaltender named Vladislav Tre-
tiak, who ranks with Ken Dryden
and Bernie Parent as the world's
best goalkeeper.

These three Russian stars lead
the Central Army Club (last year’s
champion in Russia) and the
Soviet Wings (the runners-up)
against what the NHL considers its
eight best. The results so far have
once again been chilling.

The Central Army Club, led by
‘Tretiak, has yet to lose. It trounced
the New York Rangers and tied

Soviets Better Than NHL Best

Montreal, currently best in the
NHL. Tomorrow and Sunday, the
Army will appear in televised
contests with Boston and Philadel-
(last year’s Stanley Cup
winner), respectively.

The Army is the Soviet version of
the Montreal Canadiens, winning
19 of 29 in the Major League of the
U.S.S.R. Hockey Cha-mpionships.

The Soviet —Wings,v representing
a trade unio (the civilian aircraft
industry), as do all-other sports
clubs be_sides the armed forces’,
are even in their series, defeating
Pittsburgh, 7-4, and being shel-
lacked'by Buffalo, 12-6. Remaining
games include Chicago and the
New York Islanders. "

T Differences in the Soviet brand

of hockey are easily noticed. The.
Russians employ short, crisp-
passes and try to isolate one man

for a good shot at the goal. They

often use picks, as in basketball,

which are illegal in the NHL" and

slap shots are also very rare.

Penalties in Russian hockey are
ifar and few _between,___ Soviet
teams average 8.3 penalty minutes
per game, while the Flyers average
more than 25 minutes. This may be

because the Russians rarely check

against the boards, where many

penalities occur. The Sabres won
because they" started hitting from
the start, with Jerry “King Kong”
Korab doing most of the intimida-
ting. ' _- _ I
Discipline, however, proves to be
the biggest difference between
Russian and" North American
players. No Soviets have long hair.
Only Yuri Tjerhin of the- Soviet
Wings has a mustache. The

playersare expected to practice

and play 11 months out of the year.

‘And there 1. are curtews.
Yakushev was asked once, “What
happens if you miss a curfew?”
“You don’t miss curfew,” he
replied‘. “Ever.”

Yes Canada, _there is a Russia
and, don’t look now, but she’s right
behind. The Soviets took up
hockey only a little over 30 years

.ago, but have dominated world

championship and Olympic compe-
tition since 1946. Not bad. It took
the Pittsburgh Steelers 40 years to
win a title.

Just don’t give the Russians a
football. They might win the Super
Bowl. '

BY STEVE SYBERT

New York City has a lot to
offer—the Empire State Building,
the Statue of Liberty, "Grand
Central Station. It also has some
quality hockey teams. But try to
tell that to the Pitt Hockey Club.

The Pitt skaters included three
skirmishes with New York teams in
their sight-seeing schedule, win-
ning two games for the second year
in a row, and tying the third.

The only blemish in the
successful roadtrip was the Pan-
thers’ inability for the third time to
defeat Iona College. Iona won, 2-0,
in New‘ York last year, then
defeated Pitt, 4-3, earlier this
season at the Civic Arena. This
year in New York, the teams

'battled to a 6-6 tie.

The trip began Dec. 20 with a 7-4
decision over Nassau College and

concluded with a 9-4 walloping of

Wagner following the tie with _Iona.
Overall, Coach Len Barcalow was

more than pleased with his club’s .
. performance. ‘

' “The whole trip was a success,”

when you consider that we lost a
few key players." -

The injuries could play an
important role against ACC, most
notablyin the case of forward Kim
Raymond, who returned to practice
on Tuesdav. her first time on the
courts since she injured her knee in
the Invitational. She's an integral
part of the team.

However, the Pantherettes do

just shows how much we really

the year, unbeaten in their last five
games following the opening loss to
Iona. As in thepasttwo years, the
team’s statistics are awesome-48
goals scored in six games (8.0
average) and 19 goals allowed’(3.3
average)". ‘- .‘

Barcalow feels his 'club’_s quality
play is having an effect on the
alumni and will someday lead to
major changes in the Pitt hockey
program.

“The New York alumni, repres-
ented by Owen Daley, were
extremely enthusiastic about our
club,” he said. “They even drove
from New York City to New Jersey
to see the Wagner game. They
were amazed to see the University

represented by a winning hockey’

club." .
Against Nassau, the‘ Panthers

jumped to a 3-0 lead and never fell .

behind. Nassau closed the gap to
5-4 in the third period, but Pitt

players in the Northeast.‘ And
Debbie “Big Red" Jones is in good

- condition and ready to go at center,~

after proving to be the team’s
binding fo_rce in the Invitational.

“She still has a few rough edges
offensively." Wallace admitted,
“but her reb(“_""-ling is excellent.”

As for ACC, Wallace is ‘a bit
apprehensive. Most of the ACC
players are veterans. Also..despite

its 7-4 victory.

Bill Gedeon and Rick Vernon
scored short-handed goals 11
seconds apart with Gary Fries in
the penalty box for slashing to
surprise Nassau and take the sting
out of its third-period comeback
attempt.
with three goals, followed by
Vernon, who had two, and Gedeon
and Curt Heti, who each had one.

Pitt jumped out to an early lead
against Iona only to see it dissolve
in what was a seesaw battle all the
way. Hetz opened the scoring only
19 seconds into the ‘game, but Iona
rebounded to take a 3-1 lead with
seven minutes elapsed.

Then, with 4:24 to go in the first
period, the Panthers caught fire
and scored five goals before the
16-minute period was out. But Pitt
failed to hold onto its 6-3 lead. Iona
scored three times in.the second
period to gain a tie. The ﬁnal
period was scoreless.

“We would have had three wins
if not for costly penalties,” said
Barcalow. “We came so close to
getting ‘ that winning goal, but
couldn’t get it.”

Scott Kimmick led Pitt .

(whom the Pantherettes take on
Jan. 12 when they play preliminar-

ie.-. to the men's game at the Civic
Arena).

So, injuries notwithstanding, the
Pantherettes are ready. They've
survived a controversial preseason
that included a coaching change’.

“Everybody is really ready to get’

in and play.” Wallace said.
‘‘I think we’re going to have an
exciting year." '

Hetz led the Pitt attack with two
tallies. Kimmick, Vernon, Gedeon
and Jeff Saunde_rs scored one each.

The Panthers had no trouble with

Wagner, skating-away with a 9-4 ‘

victory. ‘Led by Vernon, who had a
hat trick, Pitt jumped out to a 5-1
first-period lead. Paul _Fischione

before Wagner rallied for three
goals to narrow the margin.

Pitt added three goals, including
two by Vernon, to ‘put the contest
out of reach. In a surprise move,
Vernon was
familiar right wing position for th
road trip. Barcalow explained why.

“Billy Day came back on
defense,” he said, “so we put
Vernon back on right wing. You
can put Rick any place, though, and

he’ll score. He's the heart of our
club.”
Pitt will play Duquesne on

Saturday 1:00 p.m. at the Civic
Arena and Barcalow hopes the fans
will comeout and support the club.
“We’re still getting our usual
standing-room-only crowds.
There’s usually about 10 or 12
people standing around,” he said.

“He was producer, the director
