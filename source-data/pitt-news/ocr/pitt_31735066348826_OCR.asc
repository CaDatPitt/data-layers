  For Teacher Evaluation

BY LORI VALIGRA

-7:  Student Government Board
‘ "“(SGB) is considering a new

teaching evaluation survey aimed
at improving the former Under-
graduate Academic Review, which
has been defunct for the past few
terms. The Board discussed plans
for the new survey at its Monday
night meeting.

A blue ribbon committee, pro-
posed by College of Arts and
Sciences Dean Robert Marshall,
may. be established to examine
faculty attitude toward evaluation,

‘ explore how valuable evaluations

would be in promotion considera-
tions, and look into the feasibility of
systematic University-wide evalua-
tion.

presented to various committeesin
If approved, the blue
ribbon committee will become
effective.

According to some SGB mem-
bers, the present system is
haphazard, with only "some stu-
dents and professors participating.
In University-wide evaluation, one
criterion for tenure would be
teaching effectiveness, according

.~_/"‘oto,\a position paper describing the

need for evaluations. _

“The University of Kansas has a
good system,” SGB member Mary
Schwarz said. “The professor
evaluates the class and the class
evaluates him.

“They have a grant from the
Kellogg Corporation for their
evaluations. The system is
effective,” she said.

Another SGB activity planned for
fall is the Freshman Register.

Platt moved to reject the
Committee's recommendation and
provide $2,100. Four SGB

  City Paper Strike Drags On  

BY BOB MAYO

The Teamster strike against The
Pittsburgh Press Company, which
has halted publication of both of
the city’s daily newspapers for the
last 12 days, appears no closer to
any settlement despite special talks
held yesterday.

Press and Teamster lawyers met
yesterday in US District Court
Judge Barron McCune’s chambers
after he ordered the two sides to
begin negotiating.

“I want discussions to start
immediately and continue until I
decide whether they are successful
or unsuccessful,” McCune said.

The talks began after a hearing
in the judge’s office at 10 am and
continued through the afternoon.

Neither the attorneys for the
Press not those for the Teamsters
indicated whether substantial.
progress had been made.

Another hearing before McCune
is scheduled for 10 am today, when
the Press is expected to request a
temporary injunction ordering the
union back to work. The Press
attempted unsuccessfully last week
to obtain the order.

The strike began after the Press
assigned a union member to a new
position for two of the three nights
per week that he worked.
Teamster Local 211 charged this
was a violation of its contract and
its members voted to strike.

. The Press later offered to
reinstate the union memberto the
original job, but the union said that
would be insufficient.

After the Press offer, Circuit
Court Judge Joseph Weis told the
paper’s laywers that in hisopinion
the union could not in good faith
continue to strike, and suggested it
should again seek an injunction.

The Press already has laid off
some employees because of the
halt to publication, but the editorial
staff is being retained. The strike

Savill can pay a $190,000 deposit
on the team within five days after
the NHL approval, which is a point
in his favor, Leiber said. In
addition to his other hockey
investment, Savill is associated
with K.M.S. Mortgage Company of
‘Cleveland.

Although Savill is planning to
purchase the Penguins in partner-
ship with other businessmen, there
are no Pittsburghers involved. The
identity of the other partners is
expected to be revealed at the
hearing today.

“The reason for the hearing held

this ‘week is the need to move

Local Students Break
Guiness World Record

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

A Pitt student and his friend
made a bid for immortality
Saturday by breakingthe world’s
record for brick-carrying by 3.57
miles, in a 43.57-mile marathan
event for the beneﬁt of the Western
Pennsylvania Leukemia Society.

Kenneth Gormley, a College of
Arts and Sciences student and
reporter for the Pitt News,
accompanied by Paul Schweibinz’ of
Swissvale, trained for over two
months, carrying two eight-pound,
f1fteen—ounce bricks up and down
streets between Swissvale and the
Oakland Campus.

“It was hell,” Schweibinz said of

the record-breaking effort,” but

I’m working on another world’s

' record and I should be ready to try

it in the fall.” _
‘Following rules set down by the
Guiness Book of World Records,
the two record-breakers had to tote
wire-cut bricks weighing at least
eight and three-quarter pounds for
The previous

record was set in Australia.

The attempt to break a world’s
record was originally a feature
story idea by Gormley for the Pitt
News.

In the past Gormley has

 

wrestled bears and researched
ginko trees for story matter.
“There were more low points
than high points,” Gormley saidof
the attempt. “One of the highest
points was when Paul and Idecided
to walk for the Leukemia Society.’-’
The attempt caused as much
mental strain as physical, accord-
ing to Gormley and Schweibinz,
because Guiness rules require
sworn afﬁdavits, testimonials, wit-

nesses and conﬁrmations before an- I
attempt legitimately can become a _

world record.
“It-strains your mind,” Gormley-

said of the paper work, “but it was 7 

worth it.
“Everyone thinks you’re insane

until you’re about to break the ' '

record, then they’re glad they’re
there to see you do it.”

Donations and pledges totaling
nearly $600 :were collected for the 1
Leukemia Society of Western

ley. .
The witnesses who accompanied
the pair were Herschel, a,_DJ for
WYDD-FM radio, PA Representa-
tive Tom Flaherty and John
Hurley, president of the Duquesne ’
University Student Government.
The walk was sponsored by
WYDD and the Leukemia Society.

rivals those used against Barry
Goldwater in 1964 and the late
Senator Joe McCarthy in the early

One need only glance at the
editorial pages of the two major
dailies in this city to see the extent
of this massive effort at character
assassination. Syndicated colum-

nists such as Clayton Fritchey,,

Mary O’Hara and Carl T. Rowan,
as well as the local editorial staffs
have accused Wallace of every-
thing from misadministration in
Alabama to supporting the Nazis in
World War ll. Fritchey has
referred to this as a “fresh sober
look at the record” but it is nothing
more than the oldpractice of yellow
journalism.‘ They use the. time-
tested techniques of twisting
statistics and quoting out of context
in an attempt to slander and
malign.

What they fail to come to grips
with are the indisputable facts that
Alabama under Wallace has been a
pioneer in the fields of health,

average. In addition, the Alabama
crime rate is higher than many
other states because over 85% of
crimes there are reported and
effectively prosecuted, in sharp
contrast to the major northeastern
states where upwards of 60% of all
crimes go unreported. It is clear to

anyone who takes time to investi-"

gate these charges, that they are
nothing more than calumnies.
The reason for these vicious
attacks by the press should be
obvious. Prior to this, Wallace was
viewed as a less-than-serious
contender, or at best a spoiler at
the convention. But now, although

_they are loath to admit it, the

political pundits fear that Wallace
may have a better than even chance
of capturing the nomination on the
first ballot. Not just because he has
assembled a substantial campaign
chest and staff, but because of this
ever widening popular appeal. In
response, the powers that be have
tried to undercut this appeal with

large doses of malicious lies and_y,,f'\.~

Woody Allen has made a funny
movie.

Now, to his diehard fans, that is
just as obvious as saying Allen

it’s an announcement of the second

comedy movie maker, but also has
produced his finest film to
date--one that may be counted as a
classic in the all-too-‘lonely realm of
intellectual comedy.

The dialogue, though funny in
itself, is merely secondary to a
master plan" that tackles the
perennial Allen themes of anti-
violence, the absurdity of author-
ity, and the seeming futility of
individual action. Now, though,
Allen has taken to making himself a
bit more of a “hero” and less of a

goat in his ﬁlms, thus eschewing,

many of his previously held nihilist
views. ,

But all the deep stuff aside, Love
and Death is a funny movie that
operates on many different levels
of humor. The intentionally

‘Love& Death’: Allen's Best

a film that, with a classic sense of
coa’n::—dy', isretensiinyts.

Since‘ comedy is something like
mystery or suspense, giving away
the humor is definitely cheating,
and it lessens the enjoyment for
those who haven’t yet seen it. But
there’s enough to go on, both
visually and aurally, and more than
one viewing is certainly in order.

Once is just enough (to pun
another recent flick, which is better
left forgotten) for seeing Russ
Meyer’s Supervixens. The ﬁlm is
rated X, so if any of you are
particularly horny and want a few
laughs, Supervixens may be the
answer.

But it’s not a porno ﬂick. It’s
more like a wild sexual fantasy with
some thread, of a plot, passable
acting and eye‘-boggling photo-
graphy. The plot is too absurd to
recount here in detail, but
generally involves the plight of one

Clint Ramsey, his flight from the
law and his encounters with
extravagantly chesty women.

It’s not exactly the stuff of which
a Citizen Kane is made, but it does
provide more than one laugh, and,
curiously engrossing (please DOUCG
the prefix on grossing)- Russ
Meyer produced, directed, wrote,
photographed and edited his film,
so it’s not exactly a Hollywood epic.
But it doesn't have a cheapie/low-

. budget look to it.

Another film surfacing in the
summer crop is‘ The Drowning
Pool, a Paul Newman portrayal of
Harper that isn't really as bad as
most of the talk would lead one to
beheve.

It’s acceptable enough escapism
and an entertaining way to pass a
couple of hours. This time around,
Newman is called down to New

[Orleans by a former girlfriend,
played by Joanne Woodward, who

« Diane Keaton and Woody Allen as Russian peasants in a typically
incongruous scene from Love and Death, Allen’s best film to date.

has received a letter threatening
blackmail. -

That original purpose is quickly
forgotten (in the finest_tradition of
detective movies) as our hero
becomes embroiled in a twisting
plot that includes murders, psy-
chopaths, nubile women flinging
themselves at Harper, under-
handed business schemes and, of
course, the watery predicament of
the title. ‘ '

As is usual with detective ﬂicks,

one part of the plot has little to do

with the next, and 7.11 the who’s

why‘s and wherefore's are really
inconsequential (remember the
classic The Big Sleep, the greatest
example of its genre? After the
movie's release, even the director

admitted he didn't know who shot - _ I
whom). It's the action of the film, , _ 

the coolness ‘of the hero as he
scrapes out of each scrap, and the
general unreality -of a “gritty
slice-of—life" mystery that provides
the appeal here. ‘ ._

So as the “little movies" go, The
Drowning Pool is not a complete
waste of time. If nothing else, you
can ogle Paul Newman_ F
