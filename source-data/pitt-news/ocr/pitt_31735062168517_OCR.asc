“Good” Fraternity Rush 

Student Parking Woes
Evoke Various Ideas;

Experts Set To Meet

by NAN ISEN

The problem of student park-
ing _Was the main topic of discus-
sion at Monday’s meeting of the
Commuter Association.

Ron Cowell, chairman of the
group, announced that represen-
tatives from the -Port Authority
of Pittsburgh, traffic engineering,
and the University planning de-
partment, would attend a meet-
ing next Wednesday to answer
questions, and propose possible
solutions to the problem. Cowell
stated that since both students
and faculty are directly affected
by the parking problem, that it
would be possible for the Univer-
sity to build a large parking lot
and charge for its use on both,
an annual and daily _basis. In
this way, the University would
eventually make a proﬁt from
the project.

Other solutions suggested at
the meeting included the install-
ment of eight hour parking me-
ters, so that the students would

Democratic candiate for Lieuten-

ant Governor of Pennsylvania,
will appear today in the SU Low-
er Lounge at 3:30 p.m. He will
be a guest of the Pitt Young
Democrats at an informal recep-
tion, where he will discuss the

al Industries, Agriculture, Labor

ey in the meters during the
school day, or an informal agree-
ment with the meter maids to
distribute tickets only on the
hour, giving the students time to
reach their cars between classes
before receiving tickets.

The Association whose purpose
is, “To integrate the commuters
into the University Community,
and to act as a service organiza-
tion to try to ﬁnd a solution to
speciﬁc commuter problems,” is
also trying to solve the problems
of an insufficient number of lock-
ers and commuter lunches in the
Towers careterias. There will be
no commutter mail boxes as pre-
viously planned, since no funds
are now available.

This year’s fraternity rush was
“very good,” according to Ed
Stack, central rush chairman. A
total of 483 men signed up for
rush this fall, a drop of 190 men
from last fall.

Out of the 483, 275 men ac-
cepted bids from the 15 fraterni-
ties. According to Interfraternity
Council President Ken Frederick;
40 less men are expected to sur-
vive the ﬁrst weeks of pledging
than last year.

Stack explained that last fall’s
rush “was just a freak year,” and
was “out of proportion with pre-
vious years.” He cited as a rea-
son for this year’s reduction in
pledges the greater number of
freshmen living on campus last

year.

Forum on Red China

..w

  United Nations’ Activities Set

This Monday is United Nations
Day. In order to coordinate the.
observance of it, the University
chapter of the Collegiate Council
for the United Nations has plan-
ned an eictensive series of activ-
ities, including several programs
run in. cooperation with the UN

I ‘ ~ Association of Pittsburgh.

The ﬁrst will be for fund-rais
ing purposes. There will be a
booth set up in the Marble Con-
course of the SU, where UNICEF

 gcards and calendars will be on

sale. The proceeds are “solely for
the beneﬁt of the United Nations
Association.”

The second event of the day

’’ will be a forum, to be held at

noon in 304 CL, where the ad-
mission of Red China will be
discussed. The forum will begin
with paper speeches. When these
are concluded, the audience will

be encouraged to speak.

Finally, the CCUN has been in-
vited to attend a dinner, spon-
sored by the UN Association,
to_ commemorate the establish-
ment of the UN. The speaker will
be Paul Hoffman, former director
of the Marshall Plan, and cur-
rently head of the UN Develop-
ment Committee. His speech will
be the first of a two week ur-
banization seminar which will
bring many speakers from the
UN to th-e Pittsburgh area.

The CCUN is also_ planning to
sponsor a model General Assem-
bly later this year. The purpose
of it is to “increase student in-
terest in the UN, while at the
same time providing a deeper in-
sight into the actual ways that
the UN functions,” according to
Peter Kemeny, vice-president of
the organization.

Hill District Still Needs
More Tutorial Help

The Hill District Education
Project (HEP) knows of over 100
children from the Hill District
who are still badly in need of
help. Several grade school teach-
ers and counselors have asked
HEP for college students to work
with slow children in the class-
rooms.

In addition to the regular pro-
gram HEP is also channeling in-
terested students into the Up-
ward Bound program. This will
enable college students to work
with a select group of high school
students who are preparing for
college. Some of these tutors will
be offered a full-time job this
summer working as counsellors
with Upward Bound students.
These high school students will
be tutored in the Cathedral of
Learning.

HEP urges students interested
in the regular evening sessions,
the morning in-school tutoring,
or the Saturday sessions, to call
ext. 7419 or come to 418 SU some
afternoon.

Transportation directly to and
from the Hill District is now sup-
plied to reduce the time spent
traveling.

Engineers

Latin America.

In an eﬁort to prepare for this,

c-ver the East. Among the places
they are going is Furman Uni-
versity in South Carolina, where
a model Assembly is to be or-
ganized; Elmira, N. Y., where a
seminar entitled “Europe 1970”

ARE REGIONAL cam-

,, ‘puses part of the Pitt ma-

  chinery striving to increase

Li - ‘higher education in western

 Pennsylvania? Do they suc-

 _ ceed in their aim to expand

 1 educational facilities in or-

der to make the goal of um-

 ' vesal education a reality for
al?

Following the success of
Johnstown, the ﬁrst Univer-
sity-related campus, ex-
Chancellor Litchﬁeld an-
nounced the choice of three
other University - affiliated
two year colleges. In Octo-
ber, 1962, Bradford, Greens-
burg and Titusville were
named as regional campuses
to continue the experiment '

S of organizing a multi-Uni-

* versity community similar to
that of the University of
California.

. THE BASIC premise for
the establishment of these
branch schools was to effec-
tively curb the expansive
need for additional college
facilities and to solve the
problem of rising college

_, _ costs. Although both of these
 7  goals were attained by new
' _ ‘facilities and lower tuition
‘ .: rates, a deﬁnite plan is need-
ed to integrate these vari-
ous campuses into the Uni-

, versity community at large.

The 1966 Owl deﬁnes re-

.gional campuses as a “ﬂour-
ishing and growing part of

.. the University community,”
 that “provides the same
, scholastic opportunities
_' available in the ﬁrst two
  years at the Oakland cam-
‘ ‘ - pus.” ‘
_ [ - To begin with, regional
_f campuses offer the possibil-
- ity of introducing many stu-
dents to college life without
 haying to worry about the
' adjustment problems usual-

smaller in size, closer to
  home, and offer few courses,

 most of the students were

Fraternity Rush came and went this term as it had for many years.
There was the crowded smoker followed by the jammies, tea dances,
« brunches, stags and mixers. Then at the end of thhe two weeks of frenzied
 partying, bids were given and accepted. The only difference this year
was that‘ if you had your ear to the ground you might have heard a lit-
tle more grumbling about how freshmen men are rushed on this campus.
Surprisingly enough these complaints were muttered not by fresh-
' man, independents or administrators, but by fraternity men themselves.
At_ the Interfratemity Council smoker as many as 250 men would “sign
, up” at a particular fraternity’s table. Usually by the time of the Smoker
" the Greeks already havespotted many men they want to rush.
Yet the Smoker will yield new prospects, some of whom the frater-
‘ nity will never 'have time to contact. Because of the large number of
rushes, it also becomes difficult for the fraternity men to really meet
' and talk with. all the freshmen who c-ome through their house. Often
_ , bids are given or not given on the basis of scant ﬁrst impressions. Like-
wise a freshmen rarely has had more than a brief encounter with many
of the brothers in his house when he accepts a bid.
The simple facts of the situation are that two weeks at the be-

ginning of the term is simply not enough time for a rational and know-
ledgeable decision to be made on either the part of the brothers or the
rushees should be polled as to whether they feel a defered (second-
know each other. It is just this kind of a situation that results in high
drop-out rate of pledges in the course of a term.

At the sametime it can be effectively argued that pledging is a
period where the older experienced brothers help the pledges adjust to .
college life. This is trueand such aid given to younger men is one of the
implicit values of the Greeek system. If our present system of ﬁrst term
rush was changed, freshmen would go through their ﬁrst trimester with-
out the guidance and structure of fraternity life.

What is needed here is a‘study to be done by the Interfraternity

- Council and the Dean of Men’s Office. Fraternity men, pledges and
rushees should be polled as to whether they feel as defered (second-
term).rush would be better. If they favor a deferred rush, it should be
determined whether the men would prefer a “hands-off” or an open

  

policy during the ﬁrst term. If both the Greeks and the ‘freshmen feel

they are straddled with an untenable system then action should be taken.

relationships with many of
the teachers. Because the in-
structors have the time and
ambition to get to know the
student both as a scholar

and individual, they are more .

qualiﬁed to help him with
his academic problems.

Although the regional cam-
puses are revising their pro-
grams yearly, a number‘ of
academic problems still exist-
Because most of the stu-
dents are undecided as to
what their major ﬁeld of
concentration will be, they
are forced to take distribu-
tion courses. These students
willing succumb to taking
courses in 15 different sub-
jects, because only one or
two courses. a-re offered in
each discipline.

ANOTHER academic dif-
ﬁculty is that many of the
students are unaware of the
many degree programs which
are available at the main
campus in Oakland; or if
they are familiar with the
programs, they are unfamil-
iar with the degree require-
ments. This poses many prob-
lems when the student relo-
cates because he discovers
that he wasted time, energy,
and money on introductory
courses which not only do
not count for his major but
also do not count for grad-
uation.

To rectify some of these
counseling difficulties, I feel

that a number of orientation
programs should be offered
to freshmen and advanced
standing students, with man-
datory attendance required.
A testing, counseling and
orientating program should
be proposed, similar to
Freshman Camp. A big-
brother or sister program
should be started to help in-
coming freshman with any
difficulties that have in ad-
justing to. college life.

STUDENT government
(SG) should send represen-
tatives to the regional cam-
puses to explain their func-
tions and each campus should
have at least one representa-
tive at SG meetings. Region-
al Campus Day, featuring a
football game, should be con-
tinued with an expanded
program, enabling the stu-
dent to see the main cam-

pus and to decide if he wants a

to continue his studies in
Oakland.

Although I do not expect
all of these and -other rec-
ommendations to be adopt-
ed, I hope this article has
enlightened ' someone. It is
imperative that a new pro-.
gram to relate regional cam-
puses to the main campusin
Oakland be adopted, so that
these auxiliary campuses can
expand and extend their ‘ed-
uctaional opportunities to
many other students.

TRAFFIC COURT~was
closed. on Columbus Day.
That just happened to be a
Wednesday night —_—_ the only
night established for the
convience of people who can’t
appear in court during the
day to answer traffic com-
plaints lodged against them.

Gabe made his way from
the darkened court room on
the fourth ﬂoor of the Traf-
fic Safety Building to the
No. 1 Police Station on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor.

The same‘ white-shirted
police officer who just mo-
ments before had given
Gabe directions to the traf-
ﬁc court" but gave no men-
tion of it being closed that
day was sitting in a chair
against the wall. The room
was new and well-lighted
and the desk sergeant was
typing a report behind a
high court room type bench.

GABE APPROACHED the
white-shirted officer and ask-
ed, “Do you know if there
will be an extension on the
seven day limit to answer a
complaint. because traffic
court was closed tonight.”

“Of course not!” answer-
ed the. officer. “Wednesday
night traffic ‘court is set up
for your_ convience. So if
you can’t make. it, it’s too
bad.”

“Well, it’s not. that I can’t
make it,” exclaimed Gabe,
“but the court is closed. Are
extensions usually made
when a holiday falls on a
day when the court is sup-
posed to be in session?”

“LISTEN FELLA!” snap-
ped the officer. “I’m not
guilty! You broke the law.
So you answer the complaint
on your own time. If you
can’t come during the day,
we’ll be sending a constable
out with a summons for your

In any case a clariﬁcation of opinion seems to be badly needed.

arrest in a couple days.”

“I’d like to talk -to the
chief, if I may,” said Gabe
in a perturbed tone.

The officer answered quick-
ly in an arrogant tone: “To-
morrow morning. Ten o’clock.

Fourth ﬂoor. Better still, why
don’t you go on the ﬁfth
ﬂoor and see the traffic safe-
ty’ director while you’re at
it.” i

“I WILL!” answered Gabe.
I will!” ~

But this trip was unnes-

sary. The administrative ar-
rogance on the part of this
officer was balanced when
the ticket was ﬁxed, and
. justice under the law and
the much needed respect for
law enforcement agencies
took, onke step* backviards.

Perhaps this episode is

eulogized by Yale’s Prof._

Alexander Bickel: “The crim-
inal law must be enforced
and visibly enforced. But if
it is remembered -that‘ its
prime function is to encour-
age and sustain civilized con-
duct, to declare and conﬁrm
the basic moral code, then
the justice and evenness of

its administration, the de-‘

cent and civilized calm and
self-consistent manner in”
which it is brought to bear
are crucial to the attainment
of itsobjectives . . .”

“IF THE criminal law can
realistically aim only at sus-
taining and vindicating the
conduct of the great peace-
a_ble majority of the popula-
tion . . . then a civilized and
even handed administration
of the criminal law, which
can command’ res_pect-and
identify itself with the mor-
al values it vindicates, is the
ﬁrst and essential require-
ment for effective pursuit of
its aim.”

Moving your body around
is highly inefficient.

lf communications were perfect,
you would never have to.

Of course, you would still
have to get exercise.

But that's your problem.

We want to make it easier for you _
to contact people, learn, ~

get information, attend lectures,
and hold meetings.

We developed Picturephone*
service so you can see as well as talk
when you call. And be seen, too.
We introduced Tele-Lecture service
(two-way amplified phone calls)

to let you hear lecturers

in distant locations. And so you
could ask them questions

no matter how far away they were.

Right now, many students can dial
from their dormitories to a

‘language lab. Soon a student

will be able to dial into a
computer thousands of miles away
to, get information for his courses.

 

If communications were good enough,
you could stay in thesack all day

Depending on the nature

of the information, he might get
his answer back audibly,

printed on a teletypewriter,

as a video image,

or a facsimile print.

Some of these services
are available now.
Others are being tested.

For the next week or so,
better get a move on.

Create Success Story

_ by DAN LICHENSTEIN
Raw ability, when it lacks the

I ' necessary psychological attitude,

will doom a distance runner to
mediocrity. For any truly ﬁne
runner, desire and determination
to work and to sacriﬁce are as
much a part of his success as his
legs and lungs. Such an athlete

~ , is Fran Shor.

Currently the number two man
on the cross-country team, Shor

 has always been one of the best.

At Mt. Lebanon High, he was on
the country’s third best four
mile relay team and on the
state’s second place cross-country

-‘team. And his district record for
the two mile run still stands.

He attributes much of his suc-
cess to his coaches. “My high

school coach is considered the

best in the state. He turned out
great teams and great individ-
’uals.” Shor almost went to Penn
State, but chose Pitt for a better
scholarship offer. He’s happy with
his decision. “I feel I’m getting

I a good education and coach Ban-
’ner is one of the best.”

Shor believes that ‘since Ban-
ner himself was a collegiate run-
ner, he is more aware of what
problems may exist for the ath-

I  . letes he coaches. “He knows that

running and winning are very

 important, but also that college

life, and other activities are just

' as important.”

Any member of the cross-coun-

0 try team will tell you that Ban-
2 ner works them hard, very hard.
He knows when they’re loaﬁng,

so he knows when to get on their

backs. The athletes accept this.

“There is an affinity between
the runner and coach Banner; it’s
not just yourself that you’re run-
ning for. He has a fantastic abil-
ity to arrouse you.” It is this
arrousal that produces winners
like Fran Shor.

Shor claims he has no real
natural ability. If so, his high
school and collegiate successes
must come from something else.
This could only be his desire to
work hard and long, to run liter-

ally hundreds of miles. a year, to
run almost every single day.

But it takes even moreﬂ “You
must have an intense hatred that
drives you. You must narrow
your scope to the one focal point
of winning the race. Think of
anything other than this and
you’re dead.” Shor admits he
lacks this “killer instinct.” He
says he’s beaten on a matter of
determination to pass his op-
ponent and leave him far he-
hind. iHe feels that he is not al-
ways a real competitor.

Is Fran Shor not a “real com-
petitor?” Has he no “real natur-
al ability?” Perhaps, but his suc-
cesses tend to prove otherwise.
A friend once said there should
b'e a million mile race for Shor
to accomplish something. As a
Wilson Fellowship nominee and
as a ﬁne runner, Fran Shor has
accomplished a lot.

 
   

Some Hope
On NCAA’s

“Hope springs eternal in the
human breast,” sayeth some fa-
mous bard. Last Saturday the
soccer team was down in the
dumps. Their chance for a sec
ond straight NCCA champion-
ship bid was gone. But now all
that is changed. The ﬁeld is wide
open, and they are in the run-
ning.

' Only three playoff spots are
available in the Middle Atlantic
division. Last year West Chester,
East. Stroudsburg, and Pitt got
them. The same trio was expect-
ed this year, but the booters’
three loses would eliminate them
in a normal year.

But this has not been a nor-
mal year. West Chester is still
on top, but East Stroudsburg has
fallen on hard times. When Pitt
faltered, it was expected that
Penn State, Penn, Temple, or
Bucknell would take their place.

Penn State is already out of
it. Penn is in the same shape as
the booters are, but their weaker
schedule will hurt their chances.
Temple is a solid bet for one
spot. That leaves one up for
grabs between the soccer team
and Bucknell. The booters get a
crack at Bucknell in November.

 

While one intrainural sport has not even finished its
schedule, another sport has already taken over.
Last week in a dorm “A” league softball game, Key-

stone swamped Litchﬁeld 16 to 7.
Keystone’s tight defense coupled
with an explosive offensive at-
tack put the game out of Litch-
ﬁeld’s reach. House of Lords, in
another game, won over Pleasure
Palace by forfeit. Both victorious
teams faced each other yester-
clay in the “A” league ﬁnals.

In the “B” league contest, Key-
stone met Random House for its
league championship. The win-
ners play each other Friday for
the all dorm championship.

Monday afternoon fraternity
“A” league football got under-
way. ZBT beat SAM, 15-0. Pi
Lam edged Delta Tau Delta, 6-0,

in overtime, while Sig Chi down-
ed Delta Sig, 12-0. ‘
The ZBT passing attack was
too much for the Samrnies’ de-
fense. Steve Mirken, ZBT quar-
terback, passed first half touch-
down passes to Joel Schlesinger
and Tom Geiger for all that was

necessary. Neither team could‘

cross the goal line in the second
half as both defenses tightened.
In the Pi Lam Delt overtime
thriller, Pi Lam’s Bruce Martin
intercepted a Jim Dockey over-
time pass. Quarterback Richie
Baumgart then ﬁred a pass to
Fred Pickney to end the game.

Hart Nixes

Air Attack
For Army

To stay alive, Dave Hart must
get reinforcements up to the
front lines. Last Saturday, is was
Navy interceptors which doomed
the Panthers to their fourth de-
feat. This Saturday, the Panthers
face the cadets of Army. And
coach Hart wants to go against
them with a strong force.

“We have to establish a run-
ning game,” Hart said. “We just
can’t keep throwing the ball.”

Against Navy, quarterback Ed
James strecthed his season inter-
ception mark to 11. Enemy de-
fenders have turned ﬁve aerials

into four touchdowns and one

ﬁeld goal. “Until we establish a
running game, our passing attack
will never go,” Hart said. “Navy
always double-teamed our ends
knowing we could not run the
ball.”

'Three fumbles and two punt
returns also resulted in scores for
the opposition. Directly or indi-
rectly, 64 of the opposition’s 139
points have resulted from offen-
sive mistakes.

Hart plans to run against Army,
despite scouting coach Frank Cig-
netti’s report. “They are a. strong
defensive team,” he said. “They
get to the football; they gang
tackle; and they hit hard.”

Fullback Mike Raklewicz, who
has averaged 4.3 yards per carry,
will probably be the main recepi-
ent of the ball against the cadets.
He has gained 197 yards and has
socred one touchdown.

Tailbacks Joe Jones and Dewey
Chester will also see action. Jones
has gained 137 yards and Chester
has rushed for 102 yards. Each
averages 3.0 yards per carry.

Thus far the opposition has
out-gained the Panthers 2-1. The
Panthers are credited with 516
net yards while the opposition
has surmassed 1,106 yards.

Except for wingback Skip Ors-
zulak, who has a fractured ﬁnger,
offensive tackle and place kicker
Howie Heit is the only doubtful
starter due to a leg injury.

by JAY ROSENSTEIN A -3,.

Dave Randour’s Navy play book remain-
ed closed with the fruitless words “victory
number 2’»’ lettered across its cover. Ran-
dour lay on his back, eyes half-closed, ﬁngers
clutched behind his balding head. In this position,
it’s easy to understand why his teammates call
him “Piggy.”

 

It was the morning after the defeat. Frustra-
tion and disappointment had replaced the optim-
ism of a day before; the satisfaction of victory
a week past.

But with half the season yet to be played, you
could see the spark returning as Piggy began to"
answer questions and talk about this week’s game
with Army.

Randour plays offensive guard. He used to be
a fullback but when a sophomore football player
is 5-10, 205 pounds and can’t move quickly enough
to be a back, he ﬁnds a more suitable position.

“It was quite an experience,” he remembers.
“I had never played on the line before and I guess
that’s the reason I didn’t play my ﬁrst year.”

Even though Randour sat on the bench as a
sophomore, his nickname made him pretty well
known. “Marty Schottenheimer had gone to my
high school and he carried the name over,” Ran-
dour explains.

Piggy claims that his physical appearance and
mannerisms have nothing to do with the name
he’s been stuck with since high school. “My father
was called Piggy and that’s all there is to it,” he
emphasizes. “Everybody handed the name down
to me. There’s no relation between the name and:
my lack of hair.”

Last year Piggy played enough minutes to win
his letter. This year he’s already become a sort
of a lengendary hero.

When offensive line coach Jim Royer instituted
the Top Hog award, it was poetic justice that Pig-
gy received the ﬁrst piggy bank. Royer, it seems,
had the brainstorm during a rainstorm. As Piggy
tells it, “We were rolling around in the mud, do-
ing ﬁgure eights and other exercises, when coach
Royer noticed we looked like hogs.” I

Randour gives Royer more credit as a teacher than as a farmer.
“His little techniques,” Piggy notes, “help a awful lot. Especially
since the guy on the other side of the line is usually bigger than me.”

Piggy won the Top Hog award against California. His ex-room-
mate, Dick “Birdeye” Miale edged him out by one and onehalf
points in the West Virginia victory.

“We jag each other off about winning the Hog, but I think it’s
a good incentive,” says Piggy. “I couldn’t keep a serious face when
the photographer took the‘ picture. Birdey-e kept screaming at me.”

It’s obvious that he doesn’t let his nickname bother him o-r af-
fect his play. Of course, hehopes to eventually get rid of’ the moniker.
“It’ll go away sooner or later,” Piggy forecasts, “probably later than

sooner.”

Vince Bartolotta Lecwes Behind
His Share to Soccer Tradition

by GUY BUCCI

Over the past three years the
varsity soccer team has achieved
the best won-lost percentage of
all University teams. Fellows like
Dave Reichenbach, Tom Staab
and George Sommer has earned
a meaningful place in this soccer
tradition. This year, senior half-
back Vince Bartolotta is contri-
buting his share to that tradition.

As a junior he was All-Penn-'

sylvania, Delaware, New Jersey
and was an alternate in the
Olympic trials. This year he is
headed in the same direction.

Teammate Blaine Popp says,
“Vinnie is as hard nosed as they
come. He plays the game hard.
That’s the way it should be play-
ed.” As a freshman, Bartolotta
led the fresh to a 2-1 victory
over Slippery Rock’s varsity, scor-
ing both goals. After the game he
collapsed and had to be carried
off the ﬁeld.

Bartolotta’s real value to his
team and his coach, Leo Bemis,
is demonstrated by the fact that
be adapted from the front line to
halfback. As a soph, Bartolotta
was a high scoring wing, but be.
cause he could contribute more
130 the team good as a. halfback,
Bemis converted him.

DAVE “PIGGY” RANDOUR exhibits the Top Hog Award he. won for his offensive. line
play.’ Piggy became the ﬁrst recipient of assistant coach Jim Royer’s prize hog,

although he insists the symbolism is coincidence.

“It’s the halfbacks,” wing Bob
Racunas explains, “who control
the middle of the ﬁeld and the
game. They run the most because
their coordinate the offense with
the defense. Vince has good game
sense and this helps him do the
job. If the halfbacks don’t get‘
the ball to us, we can’t do much
about scoring.”

Bartolotta, as with many other
American soccer players, started
his career almost by accident. He
was a disillusioned sub inﬁelder

on the Monongahela baseball’

team in high school when en-
couraged to try out for soccer.

“I just sorta took to it natural-
13',” Vince admits. “It gave me a
chance to combine body contact
and ﬁnesse in the same sport.
I’ve n-ever loved any sport so
