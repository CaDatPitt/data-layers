Students return to school for hope

By April Ann Hoak
For The Pitt News

A‘40-hour work week, classes
and homework keep some College
of Arts and Sciences students as
busy as their one-man advising
team.

Any student over the age of 22
who is either beginning college, or
returning, is classified as a non-tra-
ditional student. By either request,
or assignment by the Admissions
Office, many of these students are
advised by the Co-Director of
Special Student Programs Dick
Wood. .

In addition to his various other
responsibilities at the Office of
Continuing Education in Thackeray
Hall, Wood advises between 60 and
80 non-traditional students per
term.

His basic duties as an advisor are
much the same as any other but
include some extra obstacles that
advisors of traditional students
don’t often come across. Most have

a family and/or work schedule, and
their classes must be scheduled
around those.

“[Students] don’t know how to
get from where they are to where
they want to be,” Wood said.
“Frequently, these students ‘have
time constraints. They can only
take courses at certain times
because they have jobs, or maybe
they share in the care of [their]
family. They are in more unique sit-
uations than that of the traditional-
age student.”

Wood said people decide to
attend college later in their lives for
several reasons. “All realize that
they are not going to do anything
with just a high school diploma.
Some have very clear ideas and are
focused on what they want to do
and know what they want to do.
Others are here exploring,” added
Wood.

Georgia Dawson, an English liter-
ature major who is into her second
year at Pitt, works full time as a

The Interfraternity
Council has initiated
its own investigation
into the allegations
that a sexual assault
took place at the

Phi Gamma Delta
(FIJI) house last
month.

“We’re in the
process of gathering
information, and we
will issue a report to
Dr. Haley by Monday,”
said IFC President
Brian Rifkin.

Leon Haley, vice
chancellor for student
and public affairs,
said the IFC contacted
him about the investi-
gation.

“IFC came to see
me with a series of
things they wanted to
initiate, including
an investigation into
the alleged sexual
assault at the frater-
nity house,” Haley
said.

Haley said Rifkin.
along with a few other
IFC officers, told him
they would be con-

ducting their own
investigation with
the understanding that
if they could
identify the people
responsible for the
sexual assault, they
will.

About the three fra-
ternities that sponsored
the party, FIJI, Sigma
Chi and Delta Tau
Delta, Rifkin said they
“are not having social
functions” this week-

end.
Rifkin said that
everyone involved

with the incident is
very frustrated.

‘‘It is total confusion
right now. The IFC is
frustrated. Haley is
frustrated. Public
Safety is frustrated.
The fraternities are
frustrated,” Rifkin
said.

Haley said he has
not made any offi-
cial decisions relat-
ing to the alleged
assault.

“Monday, I will
decide on how I
would like to proceed
with the information
given to me,” Haley
said.

Pitt engineers plan
for productive year

By Tamara A. Goodman

For The Pitt News

As the sole governing body of the School of
Engineering, the Engineering Student Council
plans for a productive year with more student
awareness and participation.

“We not only represent the engineering stu-
dent body to the administration, but campus-
wide as well,” said Lori Plesz, vice president of
the council. “We are promoting social interac-
tion as well as academic achievement.”

. So far this semester, ESC has had two suc-
cessful programs geared toward preparing stu-
dents for careers in the future.

Professional Development Week, the last
week in September, featured different work-
shops and seminars to help students to write
resumes and to develop interpersonal and tech-
nical writing skills. The Corporate Job Fair on
Oct. 6 provided company representatives who

_ were available to meet with students on an
informal interviewing basis.

“The job fair was an excellent opportunity
for students to make contacts and ask ques-
tions,” explained Alka Patel, organizer of the

TEL AVIV, Israel — A bomb
possibly set off by a suicide
terrorist tore apart a bus in the
center of Tel Aviv Wednesday,
killing at least 22 people and
wounding 42 in one of the
bloodiest bomb attacks in
Israeli history.

Anonymous callers claiming
to represent Hamas told Israeli
and Palestinian radio stations
that the militant Islamic move-
ment was responsible for the
bombing.

Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the
army chief, told Israel radio
that it appeared the bomb was
activated when the bomber
saw the bus was relatively full
and near a second bus. —

WASHINGTON —- The

United States is prepared to

act unilaterally to‘ lift the arms
embargo against Bosnia if the
United Nations” refuses to do
so, White House Press
Secretary Dee Dee Myers said
on Wednesday.

She said the United States
was trying to gain support for
a U.N. resolution lifting the
embargo but warned that if it
“doesn’t succeed by Nov. 15
 then we would look at ways
to perhaps lift the embargo
unilaterally.” _

President Clinton has tried
repeatedly in the past to lift
the embargo, saying the
Bosnian Serbs have been able
to receive supplies while the
Muslims and Croats in Bosnia

have been unable to arm them-

WASHINGTON — Record
exports helped shrink the U.S.
trade deficit by 12.9 percent in
August to $9.74 billion, the

Commerce Department said
on Wednesday, but the gaps
with Japan and China kept ris-
ing. I

Exports increased 6.1 per-
cent from July to $59.8 bil-
lion, while imports rose 3.0
percent to a record $69.5 bil-
lion. The resulting deficit was
smaller than the $49.9 billion
shortfall anticipated by Wall
Street economists.

Despite the overall improve-
ment, the deficit with Japan
grew 2.4 percent to $5.8 bil-
lion, and the deficit with
China was a record $3.24 bil-
lion in August. —- Reuters

effort to develop campus

decision—making and healthy
alternatives to alcohol and
other drug abuse. During the
week the health education

‘office kicked off its year-

long “Be a Smart Cookie

In order to increase aware-
ness and correct the many
myths regarding alcohol use
and abuse on campus, survey
responses of Pitt students are
being published in various
ads throughout the year.

ESC meets every
Wednesday at noon in Kresge
auditorium at Benedum Hall.
All six of the departments
within the school are repre-
sented at the meetings (indus-
trial, chemical, civil, mechani-
cal, electrical and mathemati-
cal science).

ESC is now planning its
Awareness Day, which is to be
scheduled sometime this
semester. In previous years,
Awareness Day has been a
picnic layout geared toward
freshmen.

“We are looking for new
ideas and are anxious to get
feedback from the student

body.” explained Vicki
Vi’-1’baI16C, president.
Currently, the Student

Government Board’s approved
budget for ESC does not allo-
cate money for food.

On Oct. 26, the ESC will be
having a Halloween hayride at
Roundtop Stables in
Monroeville. There is a sign-

another facet of Heinrichs’
busy life. She currently vol-
unteers at the University
Center for Sports Medicine.

“I think it’s a good program
for students interested in the
health care fields.
Volunteering gives the stu-
dent a chance to test your
interests,” said Heinrichs.

Heinrichs said she is now
busy planning for the upcom-
ing SGB election.

“I’m hoping for a large
number of candidates, and
hopefully it will be a fair
[election] campaign,” she
said.

Heinrichs also said she felt
the university is doing a good
job in expanding housing and
in food services to keep stu-
dents happy on a day-to—day
basis.

When it comes to com-
plaints about the university,
Heinrichs said, “Complaining
won’t do anything.

“A student needs to direct
their complaint to SGB.
Sometimes the administration
isn’t even aware of some of
the student’s problems.”

At such a big school as Pitt,
Heinrichs said the “student
needs to make an effort so
they’re not just a number.”

WASHINGTON — Striking
Major League baseball players
and team owners met for the
first time in more than a
month Wednesday, opening
talks with mediator W.J.
Usery.

Usery is a veteran mediator
and former secretary of labor
who helped settle the 1974
NFL players’ strike. He was
asked by President Clinton
last Friday to help resolve the
baseball impasse. V

Clinton, perhaps indicating
the hope of other fans that
there will be baseball next
year, wore a T—shirt proclaim-
ing “Play Ball” on his morn-

ing jog in Washington. —

WASHINGTON — Former
top BCCI executive Swaleh
Naqvi was sentenced
Wednesday to more than 11
years in prison for conspiring
to take over U.S. banks in an
international banking scandal.
Federal Judge Joyce Green
handed down the sentence
after Naqvi pleaded guilty in
July to three criminal charges
of fraud and conspiracy. He
admitted he engaged with
other BCCI officials in a rack-
eteering conspiracy to illegally
take over several U.S. banks,
including First American
Bank in the Washington area.
Naqvi, a British and
Pakistani citizen, was BCCl’s
former chief executive officer
before the bank, with nearly
$24 billion of assets and oper-
ations in 71 countries, was
shut down three years ago
amid allegations it engaged in
the largest bank fraud ever. -

waitress. She decided to
return to school after having
attended college on two sepa-
rate previous occasions. “My
lifestyle needs more money to
sustain it. [Before] it was
strictly for fun, and now it’s
strictly to get out.”

Lora Dermody is a fifth-
year professional majoring in
elementary education. She
attended the University of
Michigan from 1973 to 1976.
Having suffered from cancer
on two separate occasions, “I
told my husband I wanted to
be a teacher before I died.”
Dermody returned to the
University of Michigan but
transferred to Pitt when her
husband's employer relocated
him to Pittsburgh. She works
full-time as a paramutual at
Ladbroke’s Off-track Betting.

Dermody was advised by
Wood. “I have a lot of respect
for what he does,” she said.
While being assigned to the
Office of Continuing
Education, she added, she
wasn’t lost in the shufﬂe and,
“received a real personal

touch.” From time to time she
still goes back to drop in and
say “hi.”

Asked about her overall
feelings toward the university
and her life as a student,
Dawson said she enjoys
attending college much more
now than when she was tak-
ing classes purely for fun,
and she finds all of her class-
es interesting. She enthusias-
tically described student life
as “Fabulous! I could spend
the rest of my life here.”

Even though Dermody said
she enjoys most of her class-
es, during her animated dis-
cussion, she confessed to see-
ing a problem between non-
traditional ‘students and the
administration.

“I don’t feel our existence
is acknowledged by the
administration,” she said.

She said that she and other
non-traditional students she
has spoken to often feel left
out from special events due to
the scheduling of the events.
Many are scheduled into
evening time slots — a time
when most non-traditional

students have other responsi-
bilities such as family and
work and can’t return to cam-
pus to participate.

Dermody also remarked
that people should realize that
older students can give “a dif-
ferent spin to different topics”
during class discussions
because of their life experi-
ences.

“I think the big difference
between them and the tradi-
tional-age student is here is a
group of people who have
made dramatic adjustments in
their lives in order to get an
education,” added Wood.

The estimated average age
of the non-traditional student,
according to Wood, is early
30s, and that has dropped
from five years ago.

Also, the composition of
the students as a whole has
changed. A group that once
consisted of about 80_percent
women is now evenly divided
between men and women.
The actual number of non-tra-
ditional students attending the
University of Pittsburgh
changes from year to year.

Republicans out to lunch

The 1994 election is rapidly approaching and, under heavy
attacks by the Democratic party, the holes in Republican doc-
trine are beginning to shine through.

This year’s elections are perceived nationwide as a possi-
ble turning point.

Many commentators think the Republicans have a good
shot at achieving a majority in one or both houses of
Congress, as well as significant gains in local and gubernato-
rial elections.

To this end Republicans have attacked President Clinton
and have attempted to capitalize on the powerful
anti-Congress mood. Republican rhetoric argues that
Congress’ faults are due to the Democratic majority. But
now, as the election nears, the Democrats are starting to go
on the offensive. -

The Pitt News is not endorsing either party; every race
must be looked at individually and should not be decided
strictly along party lines. However, the recent Democratic
attacks, we believe, demonstrate the essential inconsistencies
of the Republican rhetoric broadcast by the Republican lead-
ership in general and Congressman Rick Santorum (who is
running for U.S. Senate against Senator Harris Wofford)
specifically.

The first issue is simply the fact that a large reason so little
was accomplished by this year’s Congress, despite a
Democratic majority, is because of Republican efforts to
stonewall just about every major piece of legislation. Nancy
Reagan’s “Just say No!” policy has been taken a little too lit-
erally by the Republicans.

Perhaps the most deserved attack has been on the GOP’s
“Contract with America.” This is a throwback to the days of
Reagan’s voodoo economics. The “Contract with America,”
was signed by over 300 Republican candidates in a political
extravaganza staged by Representative Newt Gingrich last
month. The “contract” calls for a balanced budget amend-
ment, an array of tax cuts and an increase in military spend-
mg.

Hello!?! What possible sense does this make? We already
have an annual deficit in the hundreds of billions of dollars,
but we are going to achieve a balanced budget by cutting
taxes and increasing military spending? To do that we would

'have to virtually eliminate every other spending program we

have — notice the Republicans have no proposals for what
would be cut.

Again they are promising logical impossibilities, capitaliz-
ing on the desire of most Americans to receive more from
government while giving the government less in taxes. As
for military increases, this is pure insanity. We already spend
eight times more on our military than any other nation. Who
do we need additional protection from? Are the Martians
planning an invasion?

The Republicans’ “Contract with America” is one of .

the most ludicrous proposals in recent memory.
Pennsylvanians, when deciding between Senator,Harris
Wofford and Rick Santorum for U.S. Senate, should keep in
mind Santorum’s lock—step ideology with the Republican
leadership.

Sexual assault

How dare you of all cam-
pus organizations criticize
anyone’s handling of a sexu-
al assault allegation. Those
of us who have been here a
while recall The Pitt News
printing the name of a rape
victim in a story two years
ago. Now, suddenly, you’ve
become the pious iittle news-
paper seeking justice for
everyone.

If you are trying to win
over the approval of the
CWO, that is fine. However,
do not drag the fraternity
system or its members down
to do it. That is not your
right, your privilege or your
job. Your editorial criticizes
fraternities for not being
cooperative. Can you name
one instance where this was
the case? Over four weeks
ago, composite photos were
submitted by all three frater-
nities to the proper authori-
ties and now, when there has
been nothing done by law
enforcement officials, the
blame must fall on someone.

The university community
should be concerned with
finding and prosecuting any-
one who was involved in the
alleged incident, not going
on a witch hunt. Let’s try to
remember that we are stu-
dents, and we have rights as
such. We’re also citizens of
the United States where, last
time I checked, you were
innocent until proven guilty.

Panhandlers

In reference to the
Tuesday, Oct. 10, article
“Not all panhandlers ‘home-
less,”’ by Mark Gordon and
John B. Moore, I am quite
upset with the proposed plan
to sweep the beggars from
our streets. A letter from the
Department of Public Safety

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

seems to suggest that this
will be the intended course
of action.

Welcome to the city,
everyone! We’ve decided to
study at Pitt for the acade-
mics but an added bonus is
the energy and charisma of
this city that we wake up
inside each morning. With
that comes the museums, the
street vendors, the night life
and, yes, even the beggars.
We cannot simply shun them
because we’re afraid or even
guilty each time they ask for
spare change.

The fact that the majority
of these panhandles have
extensive criminal records is
irrelevant. How many uni-
versity staff members have
criminal records? And how
is that any kind of criteria
for dismissal from our
streets? The cases of crimi-
nal mischief from these beg-
gars are certainly minimal.

Instead of creating more of
a fantasy land here at the
University of Pittsburgh, we
should learn to live with our
neighbors on the street who
have as much right.to stand
there as any student. We
need to open our eyes and
see that the real world is
among us right here in beau-
tiful Oakland. Otherwise,
before we know it, this uni-
versity will be totally isolat-
ed, with students never even
having to leave their dorm
rooms. Does anyone else
want to go to school in a
vacuum? Not me.

Abortion column

I would just like to say
a few words about the article
“Nowlin takes a close look
at religion and abortion.”
First of all, I was
also “unshocked” at the
death of the doctor..from
Pensacola.

Actually, I began to fear
for my own life. I was
an escort at a local abor-
tion clinic in New Jersey,
and since an escort was
also killed, I was unsure
how the protestors
would react. Luckily, I’m
OK.

I don’t believe that most
pro-lifers . act this
way. However, I do believe
strongly in a separation
of church and state -
something which I believe
the anti-choice move-
ment does not see.
Godlessness and moral

degeneracy must not inter-.

fere with abortion politics.
Abortion has to do with
women choosing what they
do with their own bodies, not
with a god.

Legalized abortion is not
to blame for many of the
social disfunctions of our
country.

Actually, legalized abor-
tion saves women from
deadly back-alley abortions.
It also provides rape victims
with a choice; pregnancy
for such women could be
horrifying. Therefore, I
believe that a religious issue
should not interfere with a
woman’s right to have an
abortion.

To sum it up, I regret that
the pro-life movement getsa
violent reputation from the
minority of crazy people.
Yet, why should innocent
people be killed because of

their support of legal abor- i

don?

If there is a god, I don’t
believe that s/he would
believe that killing those
who perform or support
abortion is moral. In addi-
tion, our government. who
we elect, runs our country.
God should not tell me
whether or not I can have an
abortion.

Shall We Dance?

PuIpFiction

Written and Directed by
Quentin Tarantino

Starring John Travolta,
Samuel L. Jackson, Uma
Thurman and Bruce Willis

When Mr. Blonde lops off
the ear of a cop while dancing
to the Stealers Wheel’s “Stuck
in the Middle With You” in
Reservoir Dogs, we may
wince at the scene, but we
laugh even harder at the

movie. lt’s the Roadrunner ,

bashing the anvil on Wile E.
Coyote’s head for the
umpteenth time. This is signa-
ture Tarantino.

It’s the same idea behind
Pulp Fiction — we’re watching
cartoons, real people playing
real (violent) games, only
they’re caricatures, never
characters. Distorted and
extorted properties of the
hyper-real and hyperviolent,
two-dimensional genre
glossies are all that populate
this mish-mash 70s/90s filmic
landscape and prove
Tarantino our first postmodern
auteur.

What makes Pulp Fiction a
cute cut above the pop-lit
genre from which Tarantino
models his characters after
a-re these ironic sensibilities —
at the moments when the

Wreauedience should be most

appalled, we’re laughing. Call
it screwball Scorsese, comedic
Coppola, gore with a split gut
or a souped-up sitcom —
whatever. The film’s strength
lies not with a Reservoir Dogs
visceral gangster appeal, but
rather in the slimy telling of
silly, unpredictable stories.

The Pittsburgh Public Theater Presents

Quentin’s camera goes over
the top with cheap gimmicks
and an adolescent flare for
excessive stylization which
vulgarly, and appropriately,
match the film’s freakish mate-
rial.

Sure the thugs blow each
other away with reckless,
indulgent abandon and zippo
remorse, but unlike many a
Hollywood crimescape these
characters are subject to a
tragic-comic humility. While
the movie may be based on
stock characters reminiscent
of noir: the boxer who takes a
dive for cash, the
adultress/seductive wife, hard-
boiled criminals, impish crimi-
nals and a couch potato dope
dealer — their stories get a
more absurdist lampooning
than the traditional confines of
lurid literature, sometimes
waxing philosophically with
highly sensationalized dia-
logue.

Hitmen Vincent Vega (John
Travolta) and the superbad
Jules (Samuel L. Jackson)
help give the film its comic
book of hyperbole tone. Their
dialogue before they blast a
couple of chumps who did
bossman wrong rambles jocu-
larly from McDona|d’s Quarter
Pounders, European hash
bars and whether or not foot
massages constitute sexual
innuendo, but without advanc-
ing the action one bit.
Tangential vignettes similar to
these abound throughout the
film, and are often punctuated
with graphic violence provok-
ing a “that’s disgusting, ha-hal”
from the audience.

But rarely are audiences

sntnn      
stunts  

allowed to watch their protago-
nists screw up the way they do
in Pulp Fiction. After accidently
blowing away one toe in the
back seat of their car, Vega
and Jules wind up domesticat-
ed in suburbia, dressed like
dorks, wiping blood off the rear
windshield and picking brain
off the seat. Marsellus Wallace
(Vingh Rhames) and Butch
Coolidge (Bruce Willis) are
enemies who beat each other
into a helpless situation con-
trolled by redneck rapists (in
one of the film’s most tense
and bizarre scenes)? Over and
over and over, the movie
delights in making a mockery
of its befuddled characters a la
Dog Day Afternoon.

Acolorful, stick ‘em up tone
is ‘set early on in the jumpy tri-
part narrative with Rosanna
Arquette’s hasty declaration of
a robbery in a restaurant she
and her Pumpkin (Tim Roth)
happen to be eating breakfast:
“Any of you fuckin’ pricks
move and l’ll have to kill every
one of you mutherfuckers,”
she screams. Abruptly, Pulp
Fiction then breaks into its
opening credits, juxtaposing
the robbery with Dick Dale’s
50s surfer—twang ‘fMisirlou”
which screams, “This is a
Tarantino flick, laugh or leave.’’

Like Jules’ wallet, Quentin’s
a “bad muthafucker” these
days and he’s found a cozy
niche in Hollywood. In regard
to Dogs ear slicing scene,
Tarantino told Rolling Stone,
‘‘It never bothered me when
people walked out. It just
meant that scene worked. Go
to a video store, and nine out
of 10 films in the action-adven-

.,',,
“Trix, - .

Uma Thurman and John Travl

ture section are more graphic
than mine. But I’m not interest-
ed in making a cartoon. I’m
interested in making violence
real.” Not quite, Quentin.
Tarantino’s films are hyped-up
cartoons, mean as hell but
less than real. If anything he’s
a new Warhol, turning pop-cul-
ture conventions on them-
selves and into a new kind
high art. Tarantino’s way
avoids the problematics of

ta in Pulp Fiction.
addressing real cultural vio-
lence, and we’re never in dan-
ger of getting an annoyingly
heavy-handed effort like Oliver
Stone’s Natural Born Killers.
Instead we’re in receipt of a
smart, slick pop-culture guru
toting a double-barrelled cam-
era whose films satisfy our
habitual need for bigger, bad-
der low-life cartoons.

WHAT IS YOUR
BIOLOGICAL
TIME?

TIMOTHY MONK

Associate Professor of Psychiatry
University of Pittsburgh

Friday, October 21, 1994

3:30-4:30 p.rrL
3500 Cathedral of Learning

The new field of Chronobiology yields -

startling insights into processes that govern
how well we sleep, feel, work and behave,
and what happens when the circadian system
——the human biological clock—-is dismpted by
night work, mental illness, space travel and
advancing age. In this lecture Dr. Monk will
explain these insights and the latest
challenges at the frontier that he and other
leading chronobiologists are investigating.

ALL ARE WELCOME!

 

    

Hey ‘Pittsburgh! How y'all
feel out there? I’m just diggin’
through some stuff here, and
guess what I dug up? The
mouths and minds that you
loved in Wu-Tang Clan,
Stetsasonic and T00 Poetic
are here in the all-writing, all-
producing group, The
Gravediggaz. I know that my
man Blakk Steel hit you off
with a record review, but I’m
going to hit you with an
overview of the group itself.
So let's unearth some shit.
The name Gravediggaz
itself, as Prince Rakeem says,
“is wicked, but it's more than
that. its significance and
derivation is that so many peo-
ple are slaves of the mental
death; they don’t know what’s
going on. Our idea is to dig up
their mental grave and shed
on them a little light about
what time it is.” The words of
the Rza ring true if you listen

to the actual songs them-
selves and not the titles.
Unfortunately, this group has
been lumped into the latest
phase of Hip-Hop “Horra
Core,” which is known for its
lyrics refering to the macabre.
The artists are a mix-and-
match of people from other
groups. Prince “The RZA”
Rakeem from the Wu-Tang
Clan, Fruitkwan and Prince
Paul from Stetsasonic and
T00 Poetic make up the
group. To add a different fla-
vor to the group, they each
chose a character to perform
their task. Too Poetic is the
Grym Reaper; he brings them
in. Then Prince Paul, The
Undertaker, prepares them.
Fruitkwan is the Gatekeeper;
he sees who’s gonna go
through the gate and decides
whether to let them burn or to
give them to the Rzarector,
who is the Rza. The Rzarector

it was Prince Paul who
brought the project together.
When he wanted to probe, to
push deeper into the unknown
with his music, he “called
together the most talented
people I knew that weren’t
really out there.” Except for the
Rza with his recent success

had to resurrect ourselves.
There was a darkness. And
within that context, [the music]
fed off the negative vibe, and
so anger is the underlying ele-
ment. A lot of stuff within this
record is_ a good artistic
release for us. We made this
record as though our lives
depended on it”.

Says Poetic, “The industry
was skeptical about all of us;
they felt that we had our
chance and that we were
over. But this album proves
we have the creative stamina
to overcome any obstacles
that the industry put before
us. We discovered our music
trapped the mind in the fourth
dimension by going into areas
that haven’t been explored in
hip-hop before, both in subject
matter and in production. You
gotta dig deeper than the
songs to get the message”.

Their sonic soundscapes
paint a vivid picture of the
ghetto, according to Prince
Paul. Everyone goes around
talkin’ about what they do to
people, but the Gravediggaz
tracks talk about what people
do to themselves. It's true that
the Gravediggaz do talk about
stuff that the censors would
say is cold, but they only do
that if they don’t listen to what
the Gravdiggaz dig and
understand about “Suicide” or
about “Trippin.” Poetic
explains, “The titles we hit
deal with reality, with people
stupid enough to take their
own life  we talk about the
social conscience as well as
the political aspects of the
dark side. People may say
we’re morbid, but if you
wanna be morbid, turn on the
news!” Prince Rakeem adds,
“We’re also diggin’ up the
past. Hip-hop had strayed
from its original’ sound and
feeling, and we’re bringing it
back. On our cut, ‘Constant
Elevation,’ we say, ‘Diggin’ up
your past, we blast like a shot
from a blue-eyed cop that
clears the block  we’re
bringing the past to life, and
bringing light to people.’’’

Well, now that you have a
bettenunderstanding of the
crew, check out the album.
Other than that, l’lI let
Fruitkwan take me out. “We
dug up a lot of skeletons, and
they told some grim stories.”
One love.

This brother went from carry-
ing the bags and cleaning the
tour buses of EPMD, to the
very short-lived recording
career as MC E2 of the group,
MC EZ & Troup (mad shots to
ButtaMilk for putting up on that
one), back to carrying bags for
EPMD, to meeting Sean
“Puffy” Combs, doing a

cameo with Mary J. Blige and -

having the hottest and phattest
single out right now. Craig
Mack went from hard times to
big time on the charts and in
the business. But, the question
that plagued everyone was,
can his album live up to that
smash-chart-wrecking single?
For somewhat of a rush job

(considering the fact that he

was in the studio the
Wednesday before the album
was due to drop), Mack provid-
ed the cure for a seriously
oversaturated wack rush of
music (with the exception of
Biggie Smalls, Nas,
GraveDiggaz and few others).
The first single, “Flava In Ya
Ear,” set you up for the struc-

ture of the album; bare bones,
never-crowded, slow-ooze
funk that, in Puffy’s words, 
Sounds familiar, but is very
unique.” From the intro
(“Project Funk Da WorId"),
you can tell this brother was
on some ol’ sci-fi, Johnny-
Quest-Jetson-Cyborg type of
shit. in this, he flips an ill battle
rhyme over a simple loop.
“Real Raw” uses the theme
song from the soap opera
“Days Of Our Lives.” With an
EPMD-style bass backing it
up, Mack catches wrek, but he
slides in a little message to the
women that front on him. He
says:

“Manson’s my grandson, not
so handsome l’m grotesque/
fuck it, girls still rub my chest.”

“Get Down” is crazy phat
with that smooth guitar lick and
DJ 45 (aka DJ K-La Boss
from EPMD’s first album) rip-
pin’ shit like he always could.
“That Y’aIl” has Sly & The
Family Stone's “Sing A Simple
Song” beat chopped up lovely
with a bass that makes you
think of Miami. “When God
Comes”, the only story rhyme

on the album, tells an all-too-
true story about the music we
love so much.

“What the fuck’s going on
inside the biz/ shit ain't raw no
more/ fake is how it is/ I hear
brothers talking ‘bout shooting
and killing/ then going home
chilling/ frontin’ like a villain. ” ,

Aside from the smooth
groove weaved between a
sturdy, pounding drum track,
the message makes this one a
serious contender for the next
single. The rest of the album
just falls into place very nicely.
The shit’s buttahll

about the album is the Easy

“Judgment Day”). Although
they are very dope, they sound

Eve
Over the Rhine
|.R.S. Records

I first heard Over the Rhine
two summers ago when they
released their second album,
Patience. I listened to it,
enjoyed it and then wrote it off
as the easy—listening folk
music adored by the WYEP
listenership. Eve is pretty
much the same situation. The
characteristic Over the Rhine
sound (The Cowboy Junkies
trying really hard) is more
prominent than ever in Karen
Bergquist’s vocals and in the

' repetitive melodies. I suspect

that Eve is Over the Rhine's
rush for the big time, suppos-
edly guaranteed to make the
band transcend the land of
peace," love and acoustic gui-
tar. lnto what you ask? I hon-
estly don’t know.

Over the Rhine has done a
tricky thing here, making each
folk-soaked tune bubble over
with single potential. But like
the Cowboy Junkies, since
commercial success is certain-
ly not lurking in their future,
l’ve decided to look at Eve not
as a sell—out but as a_n album
with, for the most part, superi-

The folk soaked fursome, Over The Rhine.

or listenability. Occasionally,
Over the Rhine gets haz-
ardously creative and pulls this
emotionally-charged blues
thing out of nowhere.
Unfortunately for them, since
their appeal rests in traditional
folk simplicity, this lame
attempt falls short of anything
worthwhile.

The album’s first few cuts
found me quietly musing to the
band’s harmless sound, remi-
niscent of Patience. I turned it
up real loud so I could hear it
while I vacuumed. The lead
off, “Happy with Myself’ is just
that —— a little ditty bursting
with self-esteem. _“Within
Without,” which borderlines on
a lyrical masterpiece, is about
a woman persuaded to take
the side of a murderous man
because he “sets fire without
permission/in (her) heart for
sure/and maybe elsewhere
too.” Later, just as you’re sure
that Bergquist can’t possibly
be a feminist, she comes out

with “Sleep Baby Jane,” a dis-
turbing look at a woman’s
thoughts as she contemplates
abortion. Other pleasant cuts
to listen to while cleaning your
apartment are “June” and
‘‘Falling (Death of a Tree).”

The fourth tune,’
“Conjectures of a Guilty
Bystander,” begins with some
fabulous slide guitar work but
then falls off into a hackneyed
attempt at the blues.
Metaphors of the caliber of my
fifth-grade speller run rampant
in this one like, “You are a
Gardener/You cultivate my
soul.” “My Love is a Fever”
fails miserably for the same
reason and "Daddy Untwisted”
finds Over the Rhine sinking in
a struggle to emulate Luscious
Jackson. The moral of the
story: Sometimes it pays to
just stick with what works.

Eve is not a party album, a
CD for drug meditation oreven

“Satellite,” with its syncopated
on-beat, off-beat style.
“Rhyme & Reason” explodes
into the darker side of Dave
Matthews. The album then
turns sentimental with “Lover
Lay Down.”

The Dave Matthews Band
gets some help from Blues
Traveler front man John
Popper on “What Would You

Say” and “Dancing Nancies.”

Under the Table and
Dreaming
The Dave Matthews Band

RCA Records

The Dave Matthews Band
comes through loud and clear
with its latest release of Under
the Table and Dreaming. An
eclectic mix of jazz, acoustic
rock, rhythm and blues and
folk vocals make this album a
well—rounded package.

Vocalist Dave Matthews’
unique sound turns dreamy
melodies into upbeat jams
from track to track. Highlights
come through brightly on

Jazz intervention from saxo-
phonist Leroi Moore and violin-
ist Boyd Tinsley blends grace-
fully with percussionist/drum-
mer Carter Beauford and
bassist Stefan Lessard. Say
goodbye to vocals and listen
to the heartfelt, repetitive
strums of the acoustic guitar
on “#34.” Like a lock on a
musical treasure chest, “#34”
winds up with a progression
from solo guitar rhythm
through an acoustic mix and
then comes to a climax with a
sax-drum counter action. Like
all good stories, the pace
slows and finishes with the

same
melody, ' as if
“Goodnight.”

The musical message of
hope and hardships mixes well
with each pace-changing,
mood-arranging song. Like a
society brought to terms with
the ever increasing struggles
of living the American dream,
reaches
toward the light, saying, “Take
these chances...” and “my
head won’t leave my head
I’m dead and
gone....” He calls audiences to
wake up and look around.

Dead Soldier’s Coat
Peach
Caroline

Peach is not too keen on
what it takes to produce a
thoroughly good album. Dead
Soldier’s Coat is the latest CD
single from their album Siesta.
It contains four songs, of

guitar-strumming
saying,

produced the other three.

just love it!!!

which only one is worth play‘-
ing more than once. The other
three are just there. It seems
as though Peach put all their
creative effort in the title song
“Dead Soldier’s Coat,” and
after they sobered up, they

“Dead Soldier’s Coat” rolls
and twists through the speak-
ers while spreading auditory
bliss into the atmosphere. |t’s
so damn good!!! The song
consists of a bittersweet para-
dox of jagged vocals and pol-
ished melody. It starts out with
a seething, churning guitar
tangled up into the boisterous
vocals of Rick Roberts. The
schizophrenic sound varies
from violence to passivity and
back again, making it soothing
and vexing at the same time. I

Unfortunately, my love soon
turned to disappointment after
hearing the next three songs.
They’re stupid! “Children of a
Revolution” is the most stereo-
typical ‘alternative rock’ song I

have ever heard! The lyrics
are just a superfluous repeti-
tion of the song title. The
vocals consist of lazy over-
tures and Dinosaur Jr.-like
melody. lt’s typical headbang-
ing music, which is terrible.
“Smart Went Crazy” is just a
bunch of high-pitched silent
screaming. Silent because the
guitars and bass supercede
the vocals, which is not neces-
sarily bad because Roberts is
no songbird. At the end, there
is a noisy attempt at distortion
which only results in sonic
tragedy (my ears have yet to
recover!). “Stop” is not really
worth mentioning, so I won’t.

Overall, Dead Soldier’s Coat
is a we|ter— of discordant
sounds that can induce nau-
sea if listened to for prolonged
periods of time. But, if you’re
the type of moron who buys a
whole album for one good
song, then go for it!

It's a family thing  B

OT Reuben, one of the best

By J ack Becker
Senior Staff Writer.

Reuben Brown hung out at a
friend’s house one night with a
group of current and former Pitt
football players for the kind of
evening that cries out for a bun-
dle of war stories and a bit of
trash talk.

Brown, a senior left tackle at
Pitt, got into a friendly verbal
exchange of egos with Los
Angeles Rams defensive end and
former teammate Sean Gilbert.
When the debate had raged long
enough, it was time to go outside
and settle it Panther to Ram.

Gilbert and Brown dropped
into their stances. Gilbert
charged.

And the winner was 

“Oh, I won. I got him,” Brown
said. “We were kidding around
and [Gilbert] said he won and I
said I won.”

“I’d have to chalk that one up
to Reuben,” Pitt center Lawson
Mollica, who witnessed the
clash, said. “Sean was a little bit
surprised.”

The heavyweight joust was the
result of a couple good friends
clowning around. But the fun-
loving Brown has matured
enough in the last two years to
mold himself into a serious can-
didate to be the top offensive
lineman picked in the NFL draft
next April. A

DE Cornell forms
own idenrily at VT

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

Ask around Virginia Tech’s
campus about sophomore
Cornell ‘Brown, and you’ll
hear his name murmured in
the same breath with Bruce
Smith, the best defensive end
in Hokie history and one of
the NFL’s premier pass rush-
ers.

Mention Cornell Brown’s
name around Pitt and you’ll
get an answer like this:

“I think his brother is an
Outland Trophy candidate,
who plays in the East some-
where,” Pitt center Lawson
Mollica said jokingly.

Mollica was referring to
Reuben Brown, Pitt’s huge
offensive tackle and Cornell’s
older brother.

Playing on opposite sides
of the line,
Cornell and
Reuben will
most likely
bump heads
a few
times in
Saturday’s
P i t t - Vi r-
ginia Tech
matchup at Blacksburg, Va.

“That will probably be

‘worth the price of admission

by itself,” Hokie head coach
Frank Beamer said.

Cornell, who’s three years .

younger than Reuben, has
always been overshadowed
by his older brother’s acco-
lades. But now, Cornell has
begun to establish his own
identity, in a big way.

His nine and a half sacks
lead the Big East, and he
ranks among the conference
leaders in tackles for losses
(seven for minus 30 yards).
He is third on Virginia Tech’s
swarming defense with 58
tackles.

“Cornell Brown is an
exceptional player,” Beamer
said. He’s just a really, really
talented ball player who
means a.lot to our football
team.” , _

Standing at 6—feet—2-inches
tall and 228 pounds, Cornell
will give up almost 70
pounds and an inch against
his toughest competition yet
his brother.

“He was always a small,
tough little guy,” Reuben
said. “I always beat him up,
but he always fought back.
He has always been small,
just this year he put on some
size and gained some
weight.”

It’s hard to believe that one
of the best ends in the Big
East has never beaten his
older brother.

Soccer beats another non-conference opponent, 3-l

By Michael Kovak
For The Pitt News

The Pitt Soccer team contin-
ued its mastery over non-con-
ference opponents last night
with a 3-1 victory over Canisius
University at Pitt Stadium.

The first 15 minutes of the
game looked more like a kick-
ball game than soccer, as both
clubs sent long kicks and passes
ﬂying through the night sky.

Pitt had a few opportunities to
score early but was not able to
take advantage.

Senior midfielder Charlie
Wasson finally put the Panthers
on the board first with a goal at
the 25:40 mark of the game.

Wasson received a pass from
forward Eric Prex and sailed a
shot into the upper 90 past div-
ing Canisius goaltender Nick
Christou.

“That goal was super lucky,”
Wasson said, “You’re lucky if
you get two or three of those
goals during the year.”

Wasson gave the Panthers a
2-0 lead with an unassisted goal
eight minutes later. The goal
was Wasson’s second of the
game and third of the season.

That goal was set up by a
Panther throw-in, on which

Charlie Wasson (2) scored 2 goals against Canisius last night.

Prex bounced a shot off the
Canisius goalkeeper. Wasson
found the loose ball and put it in
the net.

“I guess you can say I was in

the right place at the right‘

time,” Wasson said.

The first half ended with Pitt
leading 2-0.

The Panthers, who had 14
shots to Canisius’ six, had
numerous opportunities to score

,'/l I/7,.’//.//./f7)"/7 ,;;:-.-~ 4.

Jim Madl/Staff Photographer

in the first half, but the pesky
Canisius defense kept Pitt from
widening its lead.

The halftime entertainment
consisted of selected Pitt soccer
fans getting a chance to score

, .

on a penalty shot against Pitt
placekicker David Merrick.
Four contestants took their
shots at Merrick, but he denied

all four shots on spectacular ’

diving saves.

After Merrick, who played

soccer for two seasons at
Marshall before transferring to
Pitt, displayed his goalkeeping
prowess, the start of the second
half put everyone back in a lull.
, Maintaining the theme they
established in the first half, the
Panthers missed several scoring
opportunities at the Canisius
doorstep.

Cani.sius took advantage of
Pitt’s missed opportunities
when forward Sal Galvano
placed a header past Pitt goal-
tender Kirk Brodows 27 min-
utes into the second half, nar-
rowing Pitt’s margin to 2-1.

Pitt forward Keith Hoetzlein
and Canisius midﬁelder Gordon
Anthony were both issued yel-
low cards late in the second half
for a shoving match that result-
ed from a holding penalty on
Anthony.

Pitt then finished the scoring
with just 5:45 remaining in the
game when Pitt back Mike
Dyer scored on assists from

No. I 7 Hokies explode on both sides of ball

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

No. 17 in the nation. That is
where the Virginia Tech
Hokies stand in the Associated
Press poll, and odds are they
will climb higher in the rank-
ings after facing the Panthers
this weekend.

An explosive team that is
potent on both sides of the
ball, Virginia Tech (3-1 in the
B i g
East, 6-
1 over-
a l l )
show-
c a s e s
standout
athletes at numerous positions.

“With a team like [Virginia
Tech] discipline is going to be
the name of the game,” Tom
Barndt, Pitt senior defensive
end, said. “Everybody has to
concentrate on what their job
is, or else they will run all over
the place.”

The most exciting Hokie is
senior quarterback Maurice
DeShazo, who led the Hokies
to a victory against Indiana in
the Independence Bowl last
year.

Yet, collectively, it is the
defensive unit that displays a
lot of these athletes. They are
rated second overall in total
defense in the Big East confer-
ence.

Not admitting his strong suit,
head coach Frank Beamer said,
“Defensively, we’ve played
pretty well for the most part.”

Statistically speaking, the
Virginia Tech defense is one of

the best in the Big East.

Ask Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors.

“Their defense can run. They
are highly ranked and they
play very well.”

Consider this. The Hokies
rank first in scoring defense
and place second behind
Miami in the other three defen-
sive categories. After seven
games, they have held their
opponents to an average of
271.4 yards and have limited
those teams to an average of
13.6 points per game.

They are a cohesive group

« built around a trio of solid

players who epitomize the
ruggedness that the statistics
indicate.

It is a sort of hierarchy that
Beamer has in his defensive
core, and it starts in the middle
with an athlete who has the
most seniority in every sense
of the word.

“Our leader of the defense
and only senior we have on
our first two units is linebacker
Kenny Brown,” Beamer said.

With 69 tackles on the year,
two interceptions and a
blocked field goal, Brown
spearheads the defense along
with junior linebacker George
DelRicco.

Leading the team in total
tackles with 83, DelRicco has
been a consistent player for
Beamer.

It is the play of sophomore
Cornell Brown that has
impressed Beamer the most.

“He had a great game
[against East Carolina], and
he’s bigger and stronger than

he was last year.”

Filling the position of rover
for the Hokies is sophomore
Torrian Gray.

It was Gray’s interception
and return for a touchdown
that helped Virginia Tech beat
Boston College 12-7 in the
third game of the season.

The stability of the defense
has been a crutch for the
inconsistent play of the
offense. Though they are

the terminology and some of
the formations have changed,
Beamer said. . ‘

This may be one reason for
the drop off of play compared
to last year for DeShazo, but

is playing his best football
now.

“Maurice has taken some
time into playing his best foot-

. ball,” Beamer said. 4'

From Majors’ perspective,
the offense as a whole is play-
ing great football.

“Their offense [has] an out-
standing, hell of a quarterback,
with four tailbacks that they
mix up and quite an array of
receivers.”

Complimenting the whole
offense is easy to do with a
versatile athlete in DeShazo.

A quarterback who has led
his team to only one loss in
seven games, DeShazo is
doing something right.

A top option quarterback,
DeShazo has shown durability
and poise indicative in the
game against West Virginia
after returning from an ankle
injury the week before.

Returning to spectacular
form, the senior quarterback,
who needs only three touch-
down passes to set a new
school record, led the Hokies
to a come-from—behind win as
he engineered two consecutive
touchdowns, one of which he
ran in himself last week
against East Carolina.

“That was the old Maurice
DeShazo,” Beamer said.
“When a game like that is on
the line, you want your main
man to take charge, and
Maurice did.”

It always helps to have
strong support, and "DeShaz'o
has found that in his running
backs and receivers.

The Pitt News, Thursday, October 20, 1994

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

Sometimes you can’t argue
with statistics. When your
quarterback throws for 433
yards and- four touchdowns, it’s
hard to keep him on the bench.
Especially when you are going
to be facing one of the top
defenses in
the nation
sooner than
you’d like.

John
Ryan, who
replaced Sean
Fitzgerald in the second quar-
ter of the West Virginia deba-
cle, will try to lead the
Panthers past the No. 17
Virginia Tech Hokies Saturday
in Blacksburg, Va.

It will be no easy task. Ryan

 

will be facing a stingy Hokie
defense that is surrendering a
paltry 161 yards per game in
the air. Saturday, Pitt amassed
480 yards passing. Wide
receiver Dietrich Jells account-
ed for 225 yards himself. Pitt,
which is ranked third in the
Big East in total offense, will
be pitted against a defense that
is ranked second in the confer-
ence and 10th in the nation. In
this situation, a team has got to
give.

Last year, the Panthers yield-
ed to the Hokies and were
thrashed by them, 63-21, at Pitt
Stadium. Virginia Tech scored
touchdowns on seven consecu-
tive possessions as they racked
up a school record 675 yards of
offense. The Hokies were
ahead 42-6 at the half and lim-
ited Pitt to 290 yards of offense

with their second- and third-
string defenses on the ﬁeld for
most of the second half.

“That game was just a case
of things going from bad to
worse,” defensive lineman
Tom Barndt said. “They were a
team that we really didn’t
know much about. Once things
started to go wrong, they just
snowballed and got bigger.”

The Pitt defense is still trying
to figure out what went wrong
in Saturday’s 47-41 loss to
West Virginia. Hokie quarter-
back Maurice Deshazo will
lead his squad against a
defense that allowed almost
400 yards passing last week,
including the infamous bomb
with 15 seconds left that eulo-
gized the Mountaineers on
every sports highlight film in
the nation for two days.

 

 

GUCCI HALSTON CHERYL TIEGS

The Panthers are, dead last in
the conference in defense, as
they are allowing a whopping
433 yards a game in total
offense. To make matters
worse, Tech will run the
option. You can be sure that the
Hokies saw the Syracuse films
from two weeks ago when the
Orange optioned Pitt right out
of the Carrier Dome for 414
yards and a 31-7 drubbing.

The Panthers will also try to
avoid the numerous mistakes
that plagued them Saturday.
The glaring errors were the two
blocked field goals.

“One of the worst parts of
our football team was our field
goal and extra point unit, if you
could call that a unit Saturday,”
head coach John Majors said.
“I was disturbed and upset
after the game.”

Pitt hopes to rebound from WVU debacle last week

“Our offense was West

,Virginia’s best friend,” he said.

“We will try to eliminate all the
terrible, terrible mistakes.”

And unfortunately for the
Panthers, a number of key
players will be missing the
game. The critical blow is the
most obvious —— Curtis Martin
is still out. It is likely that he
will miss the rest of the season
and may be redshirted,
although an official decision
has not been released.

Linebacker Tom Tumulty
will also most likely miss the
game.

T umulty sprained his knee
early in the first quarter against
WVU and is out indefinitely.

“Virginia Tech is one of the
two toughest opponents that
we have to play so far,” Majors
said.

The Pitt News, Thursday, October 20, 1994

Cornell

°Frompage9

“Never. And he’d agree to
that — he better,” Reuben
said.

But with Cornell’s new size
and strength, the outcome
could be different this time
around.

As a true freshman last
year, Cornell played more
downs (681) than any other
Hokie lineman as a 10-game

' starter. He finished fifth on

the team with 57 tackles and
three sacks. His coming-out
party was in week two against
Pitt when he registered eight
tackles and a sack, although
he didn’t line up against
Reuben.

“He was all over the field
last year,” Mollica recalled.
“He’s definitely one of the
premier defensive ends in the

speed and size, but the ability
to disrupt a play.”

With a year underneath
him, Cornell now alternates
between right and left ends.
Reuben, the left tackle, will
be waiting.

“I’m going to feel bad for
him when he lines up against
Reuben,” Mollica said.
“‘Cause I know Reuben is
going to be ready. It should
be fun.”

“I’ll tell you what, there are
going to be a lot of fireworks
on the field,” Reuben said.
“We’re both pretty aggres-
sive, so I’m not going to look
at him as a brother, I’m going
to look at him as a very good
football player.”

The location of the matchup
raises the ante. The brothers’
roots lay at Lynchburg, only
an hour away from where the

lK<>'

two will clash. Hoards of
family and friends, including
parents Reuben Sr. and
Oglessa, will witness history
in the making.

“I guess they [parents] like
the idea of us going against
each other,” Reuben said.
“They’ve known through the
years how we reacted to each
other and how we used to
play against each other.

“They’ll probably be upset
if one takes a dirty shot at
another.”

Is that going to happen?
“Yeah.”

But no one is happier for
Cornell’s success than
Reuben.

“Right now, he’s really
maturing and coming into his
own,” Reuben said. “I’m real
proud of him. I’m probably
more proud than my mom and

dad because we’ve always
competed against each other.
And now he’s experiencing
the spotlight and having a
good time.”

Come gametime when
Cornell and Reuben glare into
each other’s eyes across the
line, reminiscent of when
they were youngsters playing,
they’ll find out who’s the best
when Pitt quarterback John
Ryan drops back into the
pocket.

In a clash of titanic broth-
ers, they’1l pound pads,
shoulder to shoulder, helmet
to helmet. It makes no differ-
ence if Reuben pancakes
Cornell to the ground or if the
apprentice jukes his mentor
and sacks the quarterback,
they will always know blood
is thicker than water.

°Frompage 10
The rushing leader for
Virginia Tech, sophomore

Dwayne Thomas, who has.
351 yards on 79 attempts, has‘

been nursing an injury.

“We think he’ll be back this
week,” Beamer said.

Tailback Ken Oxendine, a
true freshman, has rushed for
234 yards on 27 attempts in
place of Thomas.

At split end, DeShazo will
look to his favorite receiver in
senior Antonio Freeman. So
far this year, Freeman has
hauled in 22 receptions for
373 yards and two touch-
downs.

Lining up on the other side
at the flanker position is
junior Bryan Still, who has an
impressive 268 yards receiv-
ing on 13 catches with two
touchdowns.

With all of the weapons on
offense along with a strong
line, this could be the week
that the Hokies put up record-
setting numbers.

Prex, his second of the game,
and Matt Gray.

Pitt outshot Canisius 22-17,
with Brodows coming up with
16 saves.

The game was also marked
by a large number of penalties.
Pitt committed 18 fouls to 17
for Canisius.

The win raises Pitt’S record to
7-6 overall, with a 6-1 mark
against non-conference oppo-
nents.

Despite the victory, the
Panthers were not particularly
pleased with there performance.
Last season Pitt defeated
Canisius 9-0.

“It feels good to win again,
but we definitely would have
liked to have won by a bigger
margin,” Prex said. “We didn’t
play very well at all tonight.”

Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher
said, “We’re all starting to get
frustrated. Something seems to
be missing. This team lacks that
killer instinct to put other teams
away.”

Pitt’s next match is this
Saturday against the St. John’s
Red Storm —— ranked 20th
nationally.

A victory for Pitt, which is 1- r

5 in Big East play, would be a
big boost to a dismal confer-
ence season.

“In order for us to beat St.
John’s, our defense will have to
play a superb game, better than
they played in this game,”
Luxbacher said. “Our offense
will have to cash in on their
opportunities too.”

Luxbacher feels the season
can still be salvaged with victo-
ries against St. John’s, West
Virginia and their Season finale
against national power Penn
State.

“Our schedule has been really
tough this year,” Luxbacher
said. “ The Big East is very
strong this year plus Penn State
1S very good, but I feel that if
our team gets it together we can
ﬁnish on a strong note.”

Reuben

°From page 9

that draws interest from pro
scouts, but Pitt’s Brown is gener-
ating waves of attention. Henry
says that he entertains six to
eight scouts, who grill him on
Brown’s abilities in every imag-
inable situation, each week.

Before coming to Pitt, Henry
worked with the Pittsburgh
Steelers for two years. He
coached Pro Bowlers Dermontti
Dawson, Tunch Ilkin and
Carlton Haselrig. Henry says
Brown has everything it takes to
be in their class.

“His athletic ability is certainly

‘in their range,” Henry said.

“He’s certainly at their level.”

“It’s great to hear the pro
scouts say you’re doing well, but
in the same sense I think I’ve
taken a step back this year,”
Brown said.

If Brown has regressed at all,
it’s hardly noticeable on the ﬁeld.
Brown has been restricted by a
cumbersome bandage on his
right hand since he broke a
knuckle earlier this year, and still
his performance consistently
grades out in the mid-80s.
Against West Virginia last
Saturday, Brown graded out at
90 percent, his best effort this
season.

“If you consider he’s only
blocking with one hand, that’s
pretty good,” Mollica said. “I
think Reuben is one of the most
technically sound blockers in
college football.”

Brown will carry his one-
armed blocking skills, along with
his 6-3 295-pound frame, into
"what he‘ calls the biggest game of
his career. When Pitt meets
Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va.,
on Saturday, Brown will be play-
ing less than 30 minutes from his
hometown of Lynchburg, Va.,
and he’ll be going head-to-head
with his brother -—— Tech defen-
sive end Comell Brown.

“Everyone that’s important to
me is going to do be at the game
at once,” Brown said. “I can’t
even’ count the number of people
that I’ll know that are gonna be
in the stands."

The game will be the ﬁrst time

Brown has played before his
family and friends. Not even his
best friend from high school
(E.C. Glass H.S.) has ever seen
him play in person. .

“I want to show them that I
can play this game,” Brown said.

But Reuben and Cornell aren’t
the only members of the family
who can play the game. The
family bloodlines date back
before either Brown was born.

In the late 1960s, two of
Brown’s uncles played football
collegiately. John Miller Jones
was an offensive tackle at
Arizona and later played stints in

the NFL with the Denver .

Broncos, New Orleans Saints
and New York Jets.

The other uncle, Andrew
Jones, competed at Yankton
College, where NFL-great Lyle
Alzado recruited him out of high
school.

Brown is generally regarded
by his friends, and himself, as a
prankster and a guy who loves to
have fun. But Brown’s good-
time days nearly cost him his
football career. A

He was arrested for being
involved in a fight outside the
Original Hot Dog Shop two
years ago, which got him sus-
pended from the team for a short
period of time. A

“Reuben was a little bit crazier
and a lot more undisciplined
when he was a young guy,”
Mollica said. _

“I wasn’t worried about the
future back then,” Brown said.
“But I’ve calmed down. Now I
know how to go out and have
fun and not drink up the whole
bar.” I

Not only has Brown calmed
down, but he has matured in the
process. Henry said the differ-
ence between Brown then and
now is “tremendous.”

Brown is nine credits away
from a December graduation
with a degree in sociology. He is
among a group of Pitt players
who volunteer to speak to kids in
Wilkinsburg about staying in
school. The group often visits
Children’s Hospital as well.

degree,” Brown said.

But where Brown has made a
name for himself is on the foot-

ball field, where few can match

him. , .
“I’ve been coaching for 25
