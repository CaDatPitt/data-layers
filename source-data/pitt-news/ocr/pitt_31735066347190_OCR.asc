Hard Adm is

BY RICH HARRY

Pitt may become more selec-
tive in admitting next, year’s
freshmen, College of Arts and
Science (CAS) Dean Robert Mar-
 shall said at Friday’s CAS Council

meeting. ‘ —

In a lengthy report that appeared
in last week’s Faculty of Arts and

Science Gazette, Marshall ex-

l
\

— plained in the past Pitt has- not
been selective in admitting“ stu-
dents to its freshman class,

DEAN ROBERT MARSHALL

requiring only “a high school
diploma and a certain number of
high school courses” to meet a
ceiling of 1,750 admittances.
According to Marshall, this
procedure is a “contradiction, even
a hypocrisy,” because Pitt “be-
haves now in almost every other

aspect like a highly selective school .

-except in our admissions policy.”

  Academic ,
Probation  
Declines I

_.The number, of Pitt stt_1de_nts on
academic probation dropped from
1,000 in the 1974-1975 school year.
to approximately .750 between 1975
and 1976, according to’College of
Arts and Sciences -"Dean Robert
Marshall. 0 -  ‘

No reason for the decline of the

high number of students 0 on

~ probation _can be pinpointed,
Marshall said. ‘

V A student who averages below a

2.0 Q.P.A. or does not complete 12

credits per term may be put on

academic probation for one term or

fa

N

until the student completes atterm *

with 12 credits and a Q.P.A.," above

sions Policy

Marshall said discussions ’at

— future Council meetings should
determine whether Pitt will con-
tinue its current admissions trend
or become more selective in
admitting next year’s freshman
class. the Council will present its
decision to Kenneth Wenger, dean

' of admissions.  - T ‘
Marshall in his report, indicated
selectivity. could mean a loss in
tuition revenue incurred by. a drop
in‘ enrollment. “It’s- most
important to realize there are
‘serious implications with these

decisions that have to be made, he .

told the council.

Marshall’s. report also disclosed
1,000 students last year failed to
meet minimum 'Q.P.A_. and credit
requirements during ‘the fall and
winter terms and _touched off a
discussion on teaching effective-
ness at the University." '
 ‘fO,n.e,out_.o..f three students, if
Q.P.A. means anything, are barely
hanging onto‘ school,” Marshll
said. “We’re not sure whether
grades indicate what a student

lknows.” . .

Associate history professor Lau-
rence Glasco called on Councilto
institute “monitoring” procedures
to determine the scholastic pro-
gress of students.

“Thereeis no way of assessing’

whether students are getting skills,
knowledge or ' any different set
values,” Clasco said. “There are
ways of monitoring this, but they
have -never been done.”

In response to Glasco’s sugges-
tion, Jack Daniel, assistant dean of
CAS, pointed out a. survey of
graduating senior conducted in the

_jPitt “students, wferiti ‘fapefﬁ-'ST  .. Q
E S- .

BY PAUL MATHEWS’

Students do not feel safe on
campus because they hear and
believe‘ harassment and assault
. rumors that grossly distort’ actual or
alleged incidents, Campus Police

Chief Curt‘ Graham said Friday.
“The campus is actually safer to
live on this year than in previous
years,” Graham'said at an RSA

, security committee meeting.

“There has been a 36% decrease in

crimes against persons on campus‘

over the last four years,” he said.

Graham also said last year’s
reports indicate the same number of
assaults occur during the day as do
in the night and ' “70% of all
assaults on and around campus
involve people who know each
other, such‘ as friends, relatives ad
lovers," he said. ' L

‘ ‘I can't help but feel that much of
our fears are also racially based,”
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs,

William Markus said. ‘ ‘Because we '
are not all the same color,” he said, .

“we have some subtle gut feelings
. that lend the'mselves”to anaura of
misperception. ’ ’

“We don’t like to feed students’
-misperceptions about safety, but on
the other hand, we feel it is prudent
to promote a little bit of healthy
paranoia on campus so students will
act cautiously,” Campus Police.
Lieutenant Sam Conte said.

Conte said it is most important for‘
"students to‘ act responsibly and
cautiously if they wish to avoid
trouble while walking at night." '_

“Caution is important,” Marcus
said, “but we don’t want to
heighten the anxiety problem by
excess advertising. Students,

especially freshmen, should be
made aware during . orientation
sessions of how to avoid trouble at
night and where to go should they

resident students some pointers on campus security‘ at a  

‘ afternoon;

0 encounter problems,” hesaid.

‘ ‘There are 96aemergency phones
located on campus where students
can get immediate help from the
CampusPolice,” said Graham. “So
far this year we have made ﬁve
arrests as a result of students using
these phones.” —

Contesaid if students encounter
trouble on campus they should not
fear involvement; rather, they
should call the Campus‘ Police and
let them assist or investigate.

“We can't do our job unless.

students want to get involved. call
us and give us a chance to do our
job,” Graham said.

. “If students don’t call and
involve themselves,’ nothing will be
done,” Graham said. “Student
dollars pay for the police, so if
students don "t call when they have a
complaint, they are only cheating
themselves,” he said.

“The results of those polls show H

Glasco added Pitt should become
more “structured” in its programs

and courses. “The emphasis now ,

is minimizing structure and says
education is what the student
himself says it is,” he said.

We'll Say It Again

Tomorrow is election day and the presidential race has been labeled
too close to call by the pollsters. The winner of the race will not be
determined by those who vote, but by those who don’t. Voter apathy is a
real problem and not just percentages trumped up by the pollsters.

A two-day voter registration drive on campus last month fell 40%
short of the ﬁrst day registration total during a drive in 1972. It is a fact
that students are the section of the population with the worst attendance

- at the polls on election day, which isironic, for it was a difficult struggle

to bring sufferage to the 18-21 age group.
Voter turnout always slackens during periods of citizen disillusion-
ment with government. Obviously the power of the ballot it not taken

seriously.

Not only is voting aright, it is also a responsibility. It was not diﬂicult
to register to vote. Political organizations bent over backwards to go out
to the people and register them. Registration was even accomplished by

mail.

/ It is too late to register now. Those apathetic enough not to register
' have affected the outcome of the election as much as if they had voted.

And commentators have been talking for the last month» about the
registered masses who will not show up at the polls either. Between the .
non-registered and registered no-shows, there will be enough votes to
give the loser the victory, or the winner a majority of those registered.
This is especially signiﬁcant in Pennsylvania, which is one of the states

 ‘One of the most important United States senatorial races is in this

But it needn’t bethat way. It is not diﬂicult to reach the polls and cast '

. Issues That Break The Stupor

BY TOM WASELESKI

I’ve become as omery as a
sunbather in Oregon.

First, watching Carter’s margin
over Ford narrow to the point where
I'm gonna be afraid to get up
Wednesday morning, then hearing
from this paper’s editorial board (as
of this writing) that is will not
endorse a political candidate this
November, I’ve wondered if people,
in addition to notpcaring ‘to vote,
don’t care who wins, because
there's a subtle if not deﬁnite

A difference.

So I began amassing information
over the past weeks -until it occurred
to me that this is not a year to try to

' appeal to voters’ reason.

The assessment that this is a
campaign of personalities and not of
issues is not only correct, but is also

.the «way voters want it. Do you
-actually. think the candidates could‘

A fresh point of view on national

into this presidential election.
Carter . brings to this
campaign a perspective on govern-

' ment that is unencumbered by
special interest deals so «frequently

Running for re-election in the

19th Legislative ‘District for the’

Pennsylvania House» of Represen-
tatives is Democrat K. Leroy lrvis.
Irvis,was ﬁrst elected to his present-
post in 1958, and he has been
re-elected by ‘increasingly larger
majorities ever since._

After serving only six years in the

House, Irvis was elected by his -

Democratic colleagues to be caucus
chairman. Presently, Irvis serves as
Majority Leader in the House.

In addition to these political .

leadership positions, Irvis, a Pitt
Law School graduate, presently sits
on the Pitt‘ Board of Trustees. He
was a prime sponsor ‘of, the
legislation which made Pitt a
state-related institution. This saved
Pitt from a situation which could
have made it financially -insolvent.
Taken,‘ as a whole, Irvis’
legislative credentials and his
service to Pitt are little short , of
fantastic. ‘Thus, if you live in
Pittsburgh Wards 1, 2,3, 4; 5, 17 or
18 (the campus is in Ward 4) and are

GERALD FORD/ ROBERT DOLE

Heading up the Republican ticket
(Lever 1B) are presidential and
vice-presidential candidates, Ger-
ald R. Ford and Robert Dole.
Senator Dole, from Kansas, is a
rough and tumble politician. He is

ithe former chairman of‘ the

"Republican National Committee. In
fact, he held that post when the
Watergate break-ins took place, bu
when questioned on this, Dol '
replied, “Oh, yes, that was nﬁ
night off,” He has a quick wit, but
can‘ also be a piercing force to the
opposition. ~
A disabled veteran, Dole has_
supported legislation for veterans,

He also has joined the
forces of the consumer advocates

vivacious and brilliant Mary

upon the resignation of Richard
Nixon. Ford had not bargained for
the office, but he made the most of
it. He proceeded to restore dignity

(‘Continued from Page 4)

American voters see _ Ford and
Carter as caring little for the needs
of working people. And they're
right.

Capitalist politicians can promise
the electorate world, but there’s no
way that they can deliver.
Politicians like Carter and Ford act
in the interests of a small minority
in this country—the ruling rich.

ut being part and parcel of the
"capitalist system, they are simply
incapable of ameliorating the
problems caused by that system.
And most people see this.

According to the polls, a record
70 million voters will boycott this
election. Last week the Daily News
reported that in New York “there
are more than twice as many voters
who believe the nation is on the
wrong track than there are ‘those
who have faith that it is moving in
ﬁe right direction.”

I '1 But there is one presidential

‘campaign that does support full

"employment, equal rights for

opporesed nationalities, women’s
rights and an end to cutbacks in
social -services. I In fact, this
campaign supports these demands
so much that they are included in a
campaign program called, “A Bill
of Rights for Working People.” By
now you’ve guessed whose cam-
paign this is—-the Peter Camejo-
lﬁillie Mae Reid Presidential ticket
ff‘ the Socialist Workers Party
(SWP).
The Socialist Workers party‘
believes that most people agree
with these positions. But the

« people who run this country don’t

want the American public to hear
what the SWP has to say. The
ruling parties go to great lengths to
maintain their monopoly on the
electoral system and on the media
itself. They erect immenserlegal
barriers in front of independent
parties and candidates who try to
get on the ballot. They make every
effort to legally institutionalize

Democratic and Republican access A

to TV time without allowing any
alternative views to be heard. They
fear, quite correctly, that a real.
debate with representatives of
working people cvould expose the
fact that Carter and Ford support

nnlv the rich. _
The ruling rich need desperately

to preserve the concept that the
Democratic and Republican parties
are the “Majority” parties.

The truth is that both the
Democrats and Republicans repre-

sent only the tiny fraction of people
-who own the banks and corpora-

tions. Voting for them is voting for
their system of minority rule.
When you pull the lever for
Socialist Workers on Nov. 2, you're
not only rejecting the capitalist
politics of Ford and Carter, but also
you’re endorsing the social strug-
gles of blacks, women and students

BOB CASEY

STATE TREASURER
The race for the ofﬁce of the State

Treasurer is not the focus of
attention in this election year. But it
still is an important race.

Bob Casey is the Democratic
nominee_ for the ofﬁce of State
Treasurer. Casey’s previous
experience includes being elected
to four ‘successive terms as the
Recorder of Deeds of Cambria
County. Casey also has had
experience serving as president of
the State Association of Recorders
of Deeds, president of the State
Association of Elected County
Officials and a member of ‘ the
National Association of County
Recorders. .

Combinedwith his seven years of
public service in elected office, his

record is impressive. Casey proved
he had the overwhelming support of
the voters. He is qualiﬁed in
government and ﬁnance and those
are qualiﬁcations needed to be State
Treasurer. His primary victory was
evidence of-his popularity with the
democratic voters of Pennsylvania.
ALBENEDICT
AUDITOR GENERAL
“When Pennsylvanians pay in $8
billion in taxes, they deserve to
know how that 8, billion is spent,
down to the last penny.” That is
what Al Benedict’s pledge is to the
voters of Pennsylvania as their next
Auditor General. Benedict has the
experience and the background to
do the job. As Controller of the City
of Erie, he has established a new
voucher system which increased
accountability, and he has restruc-
tured ,three pension funds for
increased returns to the city. He

also has established a safeguard.

system of review of past depart-
mental expenditures. I

As a director of the Controllers
Association of _ the Pennsylvania
League of Cities, and as a leader in
the Municipal Finance Officers
Association of America, he has the
respect and confidence of govern-
merit professionals and ﬁnancial
experts. As Auditor General, Al

Benedict will be responsible only to ’

the citizens of Pennsylvania. He
will be the man who you can count

is young, energetic and assertive. _‘
He has long been involved in the

lbmdura_1ns did once they learned to

iiliipdaling about skydiving. Maybe
it $,tne'rlsk_i-nvolved—the chance to

A Why’ did my ‘good chum, Krack,
and-I decide to go parachuting?
 A it to brush shoulders .with

l‘his must be the place,” Krack
keenly observed. “Looks like the
pilot’ just ﬁnished his breakfast.”

~_ He pointed to a garbage can in’the
A corner.
, Miller cans.

It was overﬂowing with

"Very funny Krack. I told you
before, this is completely safe.”

A gentleman handed us each a
piece of paper to sign. Just a
formality, he explained. We, were
simply freeing the center from
liability in case of injury, damage to
personal property or death. Oh.
lhat made sense...DEATH?

The pen slipped around on my

 sweaty’ fingertips as I signed the
* paper, trying to keep my eyes off the '

mound of beer cans. Kracki just

laughed.
TRAINING

Contrary to popular belief,
learning to skydive is not a quick,
painless process. No—they_ don’t
just blindfold you, stick an apple in
your mouth (so you don’t try to hold
onto the propellor with your teeth)
and dump you out of the _aircraft.
'1 hat would be too easy.

"I raining is an all-day ordeal. It
started in the early morning with
learning to exeAcute=PFL’s (for you
novice skydivers, that’s what we in
the profession call parachute ﬂight
landings). _ '

'1 here were 40 other beginners.
Most of them were college students
(and most of them were aiming to

dislocate a bone or two before.

 
 

 it for the sheer thrill of
pliiinmetiing through nothingness?

rugs and tumbled off little

platforms.
lhe idea is to learn tofall on the
right parts of your body. ‘Some

sections of your Aanatomy will 3

bounce and bend when they hit the
ground. (Go ahead...tryAit., Fall on
that well-padded cushion you carry
around behind you. Springy, isn't

But other parts, most notably

yourhead, will crunch and splinter

A when they fall a few feet and smack A

a surface (no need to try‘ this one).

Imagine what happens if_Ait-_hits the

ground after falling half‘ a ’ mile.

Now do you understand why we ,haAd; 

toA"sign those papers? A’ 

lhe rest of the day was devoted to‘

learning how to react if one of many
possible calamities occurred. Here

are some of the more _interesting

tidbits passed on to us.

simply splatter on the ground like
an overripe tomato. _  A
I —Perhaps you'll accidently pull
your reserve parachute in the plane,

~ or bump someone else’s ripcord.

Foolish move. The impact of the
opening chute will undoubtedly
blow a hole through the plane,

’ taking out the controls.

Everyone else has 15 seconds to
pull their reserve chutes. You
might as well enjoy your ride down
(at a few thousand miles per
second). It will be your last.

—Watch out for those electrical
wires. If you happen to straddle two
of them...ZZZZTT! In other words,
you'll resemble a marshmallow that
just fell into. a bonﬁre.

"lhe moment of truth had arrived.

IWANT MY MOMMYT .

‘'1 don’t know , about this.
Krack,  I said as we waddled out to
the plane, overloaded with gear.
“What if 1 black out when I jump

My heart was racing.
~ lxrack calmly fiddled with his rip
cord. "There's nothing to worry

about," he said. “Only two people '

have ever died) here out of the
00,000. who jumped. That’s good

'odds:"

' “I guess so," I replied, alittle
angry that Krack could remain so
calm while I was shaking like an
electric toothbrush- "But you could
look at it this way——they’re long

overdue to have..'.", _ __ _
My words were drowned out by
_ the small aircraft,’ which was taxiing

in to pick us up. Krack and I
AsoleAmnly ‘shook hands.

with a Camel dangling outhof the‘
side of his lip, motioned for us to

lhe door was closed.

‘ With a roar~,‘:the propelloryvhirled

‘ into motion, and we rolled along the
' smooth asphalt runway. In seconds

we were airborne.
It was a beautiful day to be up‘in

‘the clouds. The sun was shining,

and the shrinking houses and cars
shimmered below. '_‘lsn't it neat up

here," I said to Krack. No reply.

I look/edat my partner, cramped

. BILL GREEN
U.S. SENATE

...~ -

Bill Green is the Democratic
candidate for the U.S. Senate.
Green has been an advocate of the
public interest, as opposed to the
private interest, for his 12 years in
the House of Representatives.
Green fought to eliminate the oil
depletion allowance, which gave oil
companies millions of dollars in tax
breaks every yearwnow oil com-

panies pay an additional $1.7 billion

a year in Federal taxe_s_-,___

Green has pledgeddiiihself to be a

_senator for the whole state of

Pennsylvania: He comes from a big
city, but he also knows Pennsyl-
vania needs a Senator that will
represent rural areas and the west
as well as the east. 1

He is a man who sticks to his
guns, and fights for his principles.
Green ran against Frank Rizzo for
the mayorality primary in 1971 and
he is the candidate who insisted in
an open primary for the Senate
nomination in 197.6,.  As Jaclc
Anderson said, ‘ ‘Bill Green’s one of
the 10 most effective people in

Congress. ’ ’ -

PATRICIA CRAWFORD
STATE TREASURER

Patricia Crawford has represen-
ted Chester County in the
Pennsylvania General Assembly for
the past eight years. In that time,
she has fought to eliminate
unnecessary spending in state
government. She proposes three
new programs for the State
Treasurer's office: pre-audjtgchecks
and balances to allow all expendi-
tures’ to be reviewed before the
checks are signed; refusal to sign
for any unnecessary expenses; and
open books sothe public may know
how their tax dollars are being
spent. Crawford is intelligent and
hard-working, and what’s more,
she cares about how your tax dollar
is spent. A vote for Crawford is a
vote against continued waste of
your taxes. (By the way, her
opponent is not the current Auditor
General of Pennsylvania.)

PAT GLEASON
AUDITOR GENERAL

Pat Gleason is also a member of
the Pennsylvania General Assem-
bly, where he has served the
Johnstown area for the past six
years. He is an attorney and‘ is_
firmly against corruption in all
levels of government, so he is
running for Auditor General (Level
4B). ’

Among G1eason’s credentials is
the fact that he was chairman of the
Select Committee to Investigate
State Contracts, better known as the
“Gleason Committee,” which ex-
posed fraud and corruption within
the Shapp administration. The
conviction of Frank Hilton and the
indictment of Turnpike Commiss-
ioner Egidio Cerilli can be directly
attributed to the indepth work of the
Gleason Committee.

Gleason believes that the only
way to stop corruption is to expose
his source, and so he is seeking the
ofﬁce of Auditor General in order to
be a "watchdog over the Shapp
administration. -

JOHN BRADLEY
14TH DISTRICT

There are two Congressional
races of interest and importance to
the Pitt community. In the 14th
District, of which Pitt is a part, John
F. Bradley is attempting to unseat
'18-year incumbent William Moor-
head.
Bradley is 30 and a newcomer to
Pittsburgh politics. He is an
attorney and a man who is
concerned about the people of the
District. Bradley also is opposed to
the fact that his opponent voted for
a bill passed by only one vote, and
Congressmen pay hikes
regardless of public opinion and
actual need.
Bradley would rather see this

/money channeled into tax credits for

higher education, quality education
for neighborhood schools and many
community-oriented programs. As
a Congressman, Bradley will not
ignore the needs of the people in the
14th District.

is «“New" Kansas Adds
* Bright Concert Visuals  

BY M._PATRICK MONAHAN
, If there is a tighter, more

professional band than Kansas in

rock n’ roll, I have yet to see them.

Before an enthusiastic sold-out
crowd at the Syria Mosque last
Saturday night, Kansas hypnotized
everyone in attendance with a

Mid-Western blend of hard-driving /
rock n’ roll,’ classical structured’

song arrangments and progressive
‘impact.

The “new” Kansas has cleaned
up its stage show. No longer do
they walk on stage like bewildered
fzirmboys who shyly pick up their

'’:.-,instruments depending on the

music to carry them through.
Kansas is now a highly visual act.
The intricate stage lighting,
gigantic “Kansas” logo and, above
all, the members’ new looks, were
a pleasant and effective surprise.
Bassist Dave Hope has lost

Syphony
  In Mozart

BY PAMELA EUSI

Precision in the form of a piano
concerto and grandeur in the form
of a symphony characterized the
program of the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony this past weekend. Also
present to liven up the proceedings
was the Czechoslovakian conductor
Rafael Kubelik.

 e , vakian conductor Rafael Kubelik. V
 Rudolf Firkusny, also from
 p Czechoslovakia, commanded the

Mozart piano concerto (No. 25 in C
major for Piano and Orchestra,
K.503) with a delicate balance of

V I. ‘technical ability and interpretative

qualities. Execution is probably the
most difﬁcult part of this piece with
L t changing tempos, intensities and
techniques. Firkusny had ample
experience and training to handle
all of these problems and, for music

 , of this caliber, this is a must.

“The treatment and presentation

‘ . of the theme in all three movements

with the development of the theme

bushy-bearded Steinhardt ﬁnally
boomed out from behind the black
curtain, the entire audience was
already on its feet. The curtain
slowly parted, a ﬁre ﬂash exploded
in frontof drummer Phil Erhat s
kit, and there they were, the
“new" Kansas. Looking better
than ever, they tore into “Carry On
Wayward Son,” a cyclonic twister
off of their new album. Leftover-
ture.

Williams and bland Kerry
Livgren, Kansas’ dual leading
guitarists, provided the hard
metallic edge to the music. Their
work on “Down The Road,"
“Sweet Child of Innocence” and
the lengthy “Mysteries and May-
hem.” was highly charged guitar
ﬂash.

Steinhardt introduces the songs
and is the cheerleader‘ of the band.
His violin playing on “Lonely
Wind” and the magniﬁcent “Mag-
num Opus” would put many
concert violinists to shame.

In Pittsburgh, Kansas always
generates enough response to
warrant a second encore Saturday

night wasno exception, “Belexes” 
closed their exciting set but noti-the 

mouths of those in attendance.
People will be talking about Kansas
for a long while.

  Meyer.-soft  

MREA CSORBA

Usually Russ Meyer ‘shys ‘away
from the police. But here last week
to promote his latest soft-porno
ﬁlm,‘ Upi, Meyer brought with him
a policewoman. V

“I want you to arrest me as soon
as possible,” demanded the
Homewood-Brushton ﬁlm reviewer
of Meyer’s accompanyist, as his
fellow journalists scrambled for
front row seats in the Cinamette
Fulton screening room. The lady in
blue smiled and adjusted her
thigh-high police uniform and
tossed her raven black hair about
the swooping U neckline that
plunged daringly between her
nipples.

The lady was no cop; Raven de la
Croix, Meyer’s freshest discovery,
was dressed in her policewoman
Up! role. I -

Back in '58, Meyer’s budding film
career was almost nipped at the
start by the commotion his The
Immoral Mr. Teas whipped up
among Philadelphia's vanguard of
Puritanism. But court casesmove,
slowly, and when ‘it came time to
pay indecency fines, the box office
returns had netted a hand:-'.ome_
profit. . p 4 -

Thus Meyer had his start, and
being ﬂuent in money-language,
has since settled into the Mr. Teas
movie formula." Only his ﬂops-
deviated from his characteristic
light-message ﬂicks starring’ the
inapproachable sweet Alices, up
against dumb.‘ jocks.

Entourage Steps with Style

seven people involved create a total
artistic impression.
One man enters. Many colored
instruments surround the full-
bearded solitary ﬁgure. One shaft

of light across his long, sensitive. -

fingers and full, blond beard ﬁlls
the stage. The sound from his
ﬁngers alone on the guitar is
beautiful.

One note, then two, ‘then more
surround him. ‘Another guitar by a
black-bearded man plays softly at
ﬁrst. A horn seems to sound from
the hole in one guitar, its player
has entered unnoticed.

From back in the shadow, "a light,
tinkling of brass cymbals weaves
its startling quality through the
other smoother sounds.

Still a brighter beam of light cuts
across the space as a woman glides
in upon it. ‘She is long, willowy.
She mirrors sound with movement
as fast, then slow, her sensitive
body becoming an instrument in
space. .

Turning, she .meets another

Kansas Talk Yie__Ids Boredom

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

When I walked into Kansas’
dressing room an hour before the
band’s show last Saturday night at
the Syria Mosque, bushy haired
guitarist Rich Williams was practic-
ing on his Les Paul.

In the same room was a guy who
looked like an unfamiliar, no—name
roadie. Much to my embarrass-
ment, I asked if he was with the
band. He turned out to be bassist
Dave Hope minus 100 excess
pounds, ratty, belt-length hair and a
bushy beard. '

“Yeah everybody has trouble
recognizing me. They’re always
asking me if I’m with the band,”
Hope said. “I cut my hair, my
weight and beard. No real reason,
but when you’re 5’10” and weigh
260 pounds, you know there's
something wrong.”

, Pittsburgh has become Kansas’

adopted hometown. They receive .

an astounding amount of air play
and all their concerts here are sold
out weeks in advance. , _

Their snowballing Pittsburgh
success started two years ago at the
Stanley Theatre when they were the
third band on a three-act bill, which
included Queen (who canceled) and
Styx (who were forced to headline).

“We were ready to cancel that
gig when [we heard that Queen had
backed out,” Hope said. “We
thought it was gonna be real bad.
When the headliners cancel, and
they go ahead with the show
a’nyway.. .oh. . . oh... that means pop
bottle time.

“That was our ﬁrst time in
Pittsburgh, and We thought they
were going to tear the place down. _
But it went pretty nice, and no pop '
bottles. . We were in pretty bad

‘ « shape for money at the time, so we

really had to play no matter what the
circumstances.” ,_ '
Kansas is so popular in
Pittsburgh, I assumed the band was
really starting to make big money

,'and‘ headline all over the country.

Not true. But it’s not from the lack

, of effort on the-band’s part.

“Look at these bloodshot eyes.
Last year we were out eight months
'on ‘the road. Out of that eight
months, we got four weeks off,”
said Hope, shaking his head. “After

a while you can’t even remember I
what city you’re in. When you run _

into a stretch of nine one-nighters in
a 10-day period,’ you can barely keep
your \ eyes open when you go on
stage. ’ ’ l '

Everyone knows that three .is a
magic number--theologians and
mythologists toss it around as
being symbolic. So when you put a
pair of threes together to get a
thirty-three and guy named Tony
Dorsett. there's no limit as to what
might be conjured up.

And the number 33 was what got
the Pitt Panthers hectic 23-13 win
over the feisty Syracuse Orange-
men. at Pitt Stadium on Saturday.
Not only could the Orange see the
33 on the back of Dorsett’s jersey
all day long, but the leading

"candidate for the Heisman Trophy
(after Ricky Bell’s “concession”)‘
escaped for not one, nor two, but-
three 33-yard run_s, including one
which went for the Panthers’
winning touchdown in the third
quarter. '

including head coach Johnny
Majors.

“I'm glad we had him," Majors
said. “His ﬁeld goal kicking was
outstanding and that wasithe big
difference."

. Long’s counterpart on the
Syracuse team, Dave Jacobs, also
staged a kicking exhibition for the
50,399 fans, booming through the
uprights kicks from 45 and 55 yards
out. the latter to set a Pitt Stadium
record. Jacobs also set a stadium
record at Iowa with a 52-yarder
earlier in the year and eclipsed the
Syracuse school record with a boot
from 58 yards last season. ,

The Orange's other top per-
former, Hurley, awed the crowd
with his near-perfect running of the
"option, from which he rushed for

112 yards in 23 attempts and.

passed for 203 yards more, hitting
on nine of 18 tosses. Hurley’s
season rushing total now stands at
520 yards, not bad for a
quarterback.

  

Al Romano [91] and the Pitt defense jump for joy after thwarting a

It looked to be a tough day for
Pitt against the upset-minded
Orange, led by sophomore sensat-
ion Bill Hurley at quarterback, who
got Syracuse a 13-10 lead in the

Johnson recovered at the Pitt eight
to put down a Syracuse threat.

Both I.ock Haven (now 6-4-1) and
the Panthers (now 4-6-1) displayed
almost identical records going into
the game and had played pretty

much the same competition-
" Edinboro, Grove ‘City, Indiana

‘As a matter of fact, even before
the match began, ‘Pitt coach Leo
Bemis predicted a close contest.

“Should we get. back to oiir

be a fairly even’ match,” »he said ..
early Friday afternoon‘. 5

Well, he was. right. Pitt and Lock
Haven went tooth and nail in an
even match that would have made»

‘the Bobsey Twins proud.

Unfortunately, the outcome wasn't .
even. as Haven nudged the
hustling Panthers, 1-0. '

Actually, the game belonged to
Pitt as far as a territorial advantage ’
was concerned. The Panthers
performed very aggressively——per-
haps their best showing to
date—-and gave their twin foes
more than their money's -worth.

Pitt played well, but was lucky to

come away with a 23-13 victory over

- much-improved Syracuse Saturday.

‘ ‘That was a real heart thumper, ’ ’

' said Pitt head coach Johnny Majors.
“It was a game of breaks.”

Although the record shows each

3 team committed three turnovers, it

must . be noted that all three of

“ ,Syracuse’s came inside the Pitt 20.

Syracuse amassed 384 total yards

on offense, most of them directly

attributable to sophomore quarter-

, back Bill Hurley, who rushed for 112
yards and passed for 203 more.

“That little quarterback is a
jewel,” said Majors, referring to
Hurley. “They utilized him to the
best degree.”

Hurley was especially elusive
scrambling out of the backﬁeld,
often converting apparent losses
into substantial gains. Still the Pitt
defense stopped him when it had to.

“They came out with an
unbalanced line,” said Pitt line-
backer Arnie Weatherington, who
calls the defensive signals. “It was
the first time we’d seen them use it,
and the first time we faced it this
year.”

The only Syracuse touchdown
came on an 80-yard pass from
Hurley to Don Mage, which
developed from a blitz that didn't

defense with a pitch from Yewcic.

Dorsett’s career Ifushing mark now
stands at 5,447 yards and he is in
striking range of the unpreced-

ented 6,000-yard plateau.

Jacobs’ 55-yard field goal only
three minutes after his ﬁrst boot of

the half put Syracuse on top, 13-10,

until Dorsett’s touchdown scamper

with 4:45 left in the third quarter.

Dorsett took a pitch to the left and
merely followed his blocks to the
end zone, so smoothly that he held
the ball triumphantly at the
seven-yard line, with a Syracuse

defender almost close enough to
grab it away. It was not a smart act
on_Dorsett’s part, no matter how
happy he was.

With a minute and half gone in
ﬁnal period, Long upped the score
to 20-13 with a 47-yard ﬁeld goal,
after a 10-yard gain by Yewcic on a
third and 14 call put the ball within
Long's range.

An interception by Pitt safety
Bob Jury at the Panther three
ended still another Syracuse

- scoring opportunity, but the Cats
“were unable to sustain a drive and
were forced to punt, giving the
Orangemen another chance at
knotting the ‘score--a chance they
almost cashed in.

Syracuse drove from its own
34-yard line to the Pitt 11 where
they stood with a third and one
facing them. The call went “to
fullback Jim Sessler who was
planted in his footsteps by the
Panther front wall. , After calling
for a timeout and thinking over the
situation, Syracuse again handed

. the"ball to Sessler and again the
Pitt defense came through and took

possession of the ball with only
3:32 remaining in the game.

A 15-yard against Syracuse
coach Frank Maloney for unsports-
manlike conduct (arguing about the
placement of the football following

the fourth down try) started the .i

Panthers on a ﬁnal drive, which
ended in 29-yard ﬁeld goal ‘by Long
withjonly 24 secondsﬁremaining, to
make the ﬁnal score 23-13.

“It’s amazing how hard itis to
beat a team that maybe is inferior
to you,” Majors said. "If they don’t
fumble or throw interceptions or
they have a good kicking game--it’s
a long hard day.

“You’ve got to win-some close
ones along the line. They’re not all

‘walkaways. They’re not gonna be.

Everybody’s getting ready for us.”

work. Two ﬁeld goals from 45 and
55 yards out rounded out the
Syracuse scoring.

‘ ‘The defense made the key plays
in crucial situations,” said Weath-
erington.

The biggest play of the game
came late in the fourth quarter, with
Syracuse trailing by seven and
facing a fourth and one at the Pitt
11. Jim Sessler tried to penetrate
the left side of Pittis defense, but he
was thwarted by Don Parrish.

Parrish made the big play by
leaping over his blocker and making

the stop. He was beneﬁtted greatly

by teammate Joe Stone’s detection
of a giveaway in Hurley's signal-
calling that enabled the Panthers to
anticipate the snap.

As Syracuse was getting close to
the Pitt end zone, Matt Cavanaugh
was warming up on the sidelines.
Majors refused to say whether or
not he would have inserted
Cavanaugh into the game had
Syracuse scored, perhaps because
he hadn’t decided. ‘I guess we’ll
hever know,” he said, smiling.

It seems that Tom Yew-cic’s days
as starting quarterback are num-
bered. ‘Cavanaugh practiced some

last week and expects to see at least
some action Saturday against
Army.

Yewcic has played beyond
everybody’s expectations in his
three starts. He ran the option
game ﬂawlessly Saturday, and
when Cavanaugh recovers, Pitt will
have two capable, experienced
quarterbacks, just as it did at the
start of the season in Cavanaugh
and Robert Haygood.

‘ ‘I still have a lot of admiration for
thatlittle number 13,” said Majors.

. ‘ ‘Number 33 came through when we

needed him, too.”

Number 33, also known as Tony
Dorsett, also known as the world’s
ﬁnest, had one of his best games
despite incurring three injuries.
Enroute to smashing Howard
Stevens’ all college career rushing
record, Dorsett came back from a
jammed elbow, a bruised thigh and
a poked eye. _

He ﬁnished the game with 241

yards on 34 carries and ‘now has a.

career total of 5,447 yards. As the
“Hawk” says, “six thousand yards
is not my goal, but I don’t think it’s

. stretching it to say I could get it.”

Dorsett needs to average 184
yards in the last three games to hit
6,000. He’s averaged more than
210 in the last two games.

Asked to comment on a report
that Ricky Bell conceded the
Heisman Trophy to him, Dorsett

' said, ‘ ‘If him saying I was gonna win

the Heisman Trophy would get me
the Heisman Trophy, I would ﬂy out
to Los Angeles as quick asil can and
hug him and say thanks a lot.”

. Dorsett knows that Tony Dorsett
is going to get the Heisman Trophy
for himself, and since he’s running

better than ever, he seems to have it ’
all wrapped up.

  Johnson Finds Home  

BY KAREN KADILAK

You’ve probably heard of the man
without a country." ‘Well, Pitt
defensive star Cecil Johnson was

, once a man without a position.

lt’s kind of hard to believe, but it
took Panther head coach Johnny
Majors and his defensive coaching
staff two full years and several

position changes for the rangy H

Johnson (6-3. 225) before Majors

' and the staff ﬁnally decided that the

senior’s talents best suited those of
a defensive end.

The Miami Jackson High School
product was juggled from line-

backer to tackle to nose guard to his i
present ‘home at right defensive V
end. Wherever and whenever his .

immense (talents--speed, ‘mobility

and strength--were needed, he‘

played.

While it obviously is beneﬁcial to
excel in so many areas, the
continuous moving must have made
Johnson feel like a I_J—Haul truck. As
it eventually turned out, the
continuous shifting back and forth
backﬁred on the gifted Johnson--

, especially after settling in for good

at defensive end this past season.

“For a while it was getting to
me." the friendly defensive end
admitted. “l was doing a lot of
things l used to do when playing the
other positions, like taking fakes
like a linebacker does.or getting
down like a tackle and doing some
f°“9“’ln8 Up into the guard’s

‘ Pdcket. ‘

_“Then I realized I was at end

-':..ind1cation*; 

  

something and the, other team
would take advantage of me. They
sure shoved me the right way,” he
added.

Although the constant shufﬂing
from position to‘ position was
apparently annoying to the out-
going senior, it nonetheless taught

. cncn. JOHNSON

him a few basic facts about play at
defensive end--be patient,’ don't

b stray into anyone else‘s area but

your own, and. diagnose the _play
before taking appropriate action. In
other words, don’t overplay.

“I tried to stay clear of all the
wrong things," Johnson commen-
ted. “I stay and kind of sit ‘-there
until 1 know what’s going on and to
know what,l'm going to exactly do
before lrtake a step anywhere.”

If pasti perforrnance is -. any
' John'son‘ {has "'f*in'deed. ._‘  1

 

learned such facts well. Defensive
end, which’ at one time was
considered as a Pitt defensive
weakness, now looms as a strength
with Johnson and counterpart Ed
Wilamowski patrolling the ﬂanks.

“Cecil- is probably one of our
more improved players on the
defensive team,” defensive end

coach Larry Holten said. “He’s
performed consistently. He’s a
strong ball player. He’s played‘

every position on defense except the
positions in the secondary. That

- fact alone shows some of his ability

to move around.”

With Johnson's success paral-

leling that of Pitt’s performance as 3
whole during the ﬁrst half of this
season, dreams of a possible
national

mind. But they’re not.

“Really, I’m not  about a

national championship,” Johnson
added nonchalantly. ‘‘It’s in the
back of V my mind somewhere
because people keep throwing it in
my face, but I feel that if it’s there.
for us, we'll_have'it and if it’s not,

Salsbury State Invitational

BY -JOHN FINN

What is the key to a successful
athletic team?

In any game it is fundamentals.
In football, the game is won in the
“pits.” In basketball, it is won by
whoever can control the boards.
And in volleyball, the game is won
at the net.

The Pitt volleyball team domin-
ated net play as well as every other
phase of the game as they captured
the eight-team Salsbury State
Invitational last Friday in Mary-
land. ‘

Pitt coach Mike Hebert had
nothing but praise for his young
team. “We’ve shown steady
improvement each week,” he said,
“and this time we were lucky
enough to come away as a winner.”

Hebert noted a ﬁne team effort
with.everyone playing well. He
did, however, credit freshman
Cindy Chambers and senior co-
captain, Cathy Hudgens for what
he called an “outstanding” per-
formance.

‘Once again, the Pantherettes

swept through round-robin play,
having trouble only with Maryland.

‘ Pitt also defeated Virginia Comm-

onwealth and Gallaudet.

Pitt had no trouble in the playoffs -

either as they defeated Madison,
15-2 and ' 15-9, _in the
semi-ﬁnals, and Virginia Comm-
onwealth, 15-3 and 15-2. in the
ﬁnals. The victories raised the

Mel Boyd, however,‘ brightened his

Top-ranked Michigan squeaked
out a narrow victory over Penn

was also a battle between Michigan
and Penn State for top honors for
individuals, but Penn State won
this one. George Malley edged out
Michigan’s Greg Meyer by two-
tenths of a second for ﬁrst.
Boyd’s ﬁfth-place ﬁnish was the

Pitt polished up its skills by
downing a usually tough Ohio State
team, 14-7, then demolished
Youngstown State, 17-4, in what
rivera called “an easy game for
us.”

Freshman Mike Mere poured in

scorers versus Ohio State, though
Rivera jokingly insists Mere is the
team's “top defensive player."

Luis Toro contributed two goals,
while Jorge Machicote, Peque
Rolan, Butch Silva, Mike Schoe-
ﬁeld and Robert Simonetti added
one each. Goalie Walter Young
sparkled in goal with 15 saves.

“We dominated the game in the
ﬁrst quarter and were winning
5-1," Rivera said, “but I made

_some changes and substitutions
and they came within a goal, 6-5, at
halftime. But after that we
dominated all the way.” -

Ohio State, along with Michigan
and Indiana, is usually one of the
tougher teams in the Big Ten in
water polo but played defense in a
zone, something the Panthers diool
at because of their deadly outside
shooters.

‘ “I wasn’t expecting Ohio State to
play the way they did," Rivera
said. “Maybe they were im-
pressed with our passing perfor-
mance. We have really good ball
control. Ithink that’s why-we are
so good." ‘

And the Panthers really dis-
played their talent and versatility in
dumping Youngstown State. Four

JOHN HEINZ
U.S. SENATE

H. John Heinz III, 38, is the

Republican candidate for the United 4

States Senate. Heinz has been a
Congressman from the 18th District
since 1971, when he was over-
whelmingly elected despite a large
Democratic registration lead. He
has a Masters Degree in Business
Administration and so he is
qualiﬁed for the work of the Senate.

Heinz is the former vice president »

of the Urban League and a trustee of
the University of Pittsburgh.
Although he is a Republican, John
Heinz has consistently voted as he
feels the people of hisDistrict would
-want.

In. other words, he has been an
independent voter, not always
choosing the side which had the
most Republicans. H. John Heinz
of Fox Chapel can be found on Leyer
2B and will make a very good United
States Senator, the first one from
Western -Pennsylvania since 1958.‘
