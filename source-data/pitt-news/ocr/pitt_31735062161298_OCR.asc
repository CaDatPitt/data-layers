UC Court

”TightensUp

On Frosh S

Realizing that its dink pro-
gram has not gone over too
well this semester, Men’s

. _Council has started this week

to enforce the program.
Upperclass Court is ‘again func-
tioning and freshman English

-classes are being checked to see
A that freshmen keep their dinks on
s their heads

and not in their
pockets.

There are 128 freshmeh regis-
tered for orientation classes. Up
to date only 90 have purchased

dinks. Upperclass counselors have
been instructed to make sure that
these 38 dinkless freshmen get

’ dinks.

According to Richard Cun-
ningham, assistant to the dean
of men, this semester’s orienta-
tion program has not gone over
‘as well as it did in the fall.
Commenting on the situation, he
said, “I don’t think that the
freshmen are meeting their ob-
ligation as well as they should
regarding the wearing of dinks
and the participation in the ori-
entation program.

Cunningham went on to say‘

that the apparent lack of dinks on
campus was probably due to the
obviousfact that there are fewer
freshmen this semester.

The orientation period will end
Mar. 29 when freshmen take their
customs examination.

Dr. Lillian Gilbreth
Industrial Engineer

The 1951 Vocational Guidance

Large Student Crowds

Men’s Lounge on the eighth ﬂoor has been open only
four days but has already made a hit with the students, ac-
cording to Richard Cunningham, assistant to the dean of
men and advisor to Men’s Council. »

Cunningham said he was pleased with the interest shown

in the lounge and hopes that this
spirit will increase when the
lounge is completed sometime in
April.

Double Duty

Campus organizations will soon
be able to reserve the room for
use during the evenings from 6:00

bles, and jukebox, gum, candy,

Chapel Head

Speaks On‘
‘Tollgates’

Emphasis on the spiritual aspect
of college life will continue today

at 1 p. m. as the regular Wednes-
day chapel service becomes part
of the program of the conference
on “Religion-in-Life.

Dr. Raymond F. Brittain, as-
sistant professor of history, will
be the main speaker. His topic is
“Life’s Tollgates.”

Oliver Lerch, College sopho-
more, will act as student leader.

The Heinz Chapel Choir, direct-
ed by Dr. Theodore M. Finney,

With -Me,” an anthem edited by
George Lynn.

Dr. Brittain, who is also direc-
tor of Heinz Chapel activities, is
a graduate of the University of
Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh
Xenia Theological Seminary.

He came here in 1936 to con-
tinue his studies and has been a

member of the faculty since 1937.’

Congress
Re-Dates
Tap Day  

At its Monday meeting Stu-
dent Congress spent most of
its time listening to visiting
speakers, taking action "on
only one issue.

_ First Robert Lyles, chairman of
the Spring Festival committee, ap-
peared with a request that the
lawmakers reverse an earlier de-
cision and replace Tap Day on
the Festival program.

Congress had originally lifted

Tap Day from the Festival in the.

belief that such a move would
help to make it a ﬁnancial suc-
cess, and ease the Festival Week
schedule at the same time.

Traditional Grounds
'Lyles said, however, he thought
that Tap Day should be included
in the spring celebration on
grounds of tradition.

In addition he said the schedule
of events had been lightened by
eliminating Fraternity Open House
and the IF track meet.

SC responded to his plea by
rescinding its previous resolution,
thereby replacing Tap Day on the
program. .

Andy Schurman then took the
ﬂoor with a proposal designed to
ease the financial plight of the
Owl.

He introduced a motion which
read as follows: “Resolved; that
Student Congress recommend to
th e University Publications
Board that the basic cost of the
yearbook be added to each stu-
dent’s graduation fee.”

Held Not Fair

The debate which followed cen-
tered-around the objection that it
would not be fair to charge some
students for something they may
not want or cannot afford.

A vote on the motion resulted
in a tie, thus tabling the issue
until next week.

Next came Edie Davis, presi-
dent of the YWCA, with an ap-
peal for help in the Y-sponsored
program to bring European dis-
placed persons to the U. S. for
study in’ colleges here.

She said that the immediate
need is to ﬁnd people who will
guarantee homes and jobs for
these students for at least a year,
and she requested that Congress
consider what action they might
take in this direction.

The legislators decided to sit

on the problem for a week before
taking any action.

Religion Speakers Call for ‘Goodwill’

sor of religious thought at the
University of Pennsylvania, and
an author in the ﬁelds of philoso-
phy and religion. , .

Outstanding events on Monday
were the addresses by Dr. Kirtley
Mather to a convocation of stu-
dents in Carnegie Music Hall, and
by Father James M. Keller to an
afternoon assembly in Stephen
Foster Memorial. *

Dr. Mather, professor of geology
at Harvard University, chairman
of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, and
of the Commission on Religion in
Higher Education, went beyond
the combination and resolution of
viewpoints on science and religion
in his address, “Science Looks at
Religion.”

Speakers Ask ‘Goodwill’

According to Mather, the tech-

niques of both physical and social
science may be used for either
good or evil, and something else,
in the realm of religion, is needed.
This “something else” he named
“Goodwill,” the quality which will
spread like an atomic chain re-
action.

Father Keller, in his afternoon
address, made concrete Dr. Math-

er’s keynote of “Goodwill.” As the

founder of the Christopher move-
ment, which applies _ Christian
principles in all spheres of pub-
lic life, and the author of “You
Can Change The World,” Father
Keller explained the potency of
individual goodwill, and its power
for making this world a better one.

Booklets containing the time,
place, and subject of the remain-
ing conferences and seminars may

be obtained at the Student Desk.‘ '2

YVV Head
Calls for
DP Help

A campus leader is trying
to make Religion - in - Life
Week live-—by giving a help-
ing hand to some of the 3,000
potential college students among
tht Displaced Persons in Europe.

She is Edith Davis, president of
the ‘YWCA, who made an appeal
to Student Congress Monday for
help and is now asking every per-
son or group connected with the
University to pitch in if they can.

The situation, brieﬂy, is this:

There are right‘ now 3000 DP
students in European Countries

S who are well qualiﬁed for further

education but right now are in a
position where they can get nei-
ther employment or education.
By an act of Congress, these
students can enter the U. S. to

I ~ study here but they need a spon-
sor to do s0—either~a group or an

organization. The job of the spon-
sor, however, is a painless one,
according to Miss Davis.

The sponsor is obligated only_

to ﬁnd housing and a job for the
student for a year and to pay
transportation expenses from the
student’s port of entry to the place
where he will live.

But time is short and people
who are interested in acting as
sponsors must notify Miss Davis
at the YWCA office in the Cathe-
dral by Mar. 145.

Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity has
sponsored student Paul Weiner
during the past year. .

Pitt Graduate
Brings Back
The Dead _

Peter M. Czarniewski, a for-
mer Pittsburgher, owes his life
to Dr. August H. Becker, a 1944
graduate of the School of Medi-
cine.

Last Friday, Mr. Czarniewski
was being readied for a kidney
operation, when suddenly his
heart stopped beating.

Assistants immediately called
Dr. Becker, who, without stop-
pinggto don a pair of sterile
gloves, rapidly made a 10-inch
incision in the patient’s chest
and began massaging the heart
with his hands.

In less than 30 seconds, the
heart responded and resumed its
beating.

Mr. Czarniewski is recovering
in Cleveland where he has ‘.ived
for the last 25 years. Doctors
expect him to be ready to un-
dergo the surgery in a few days.

19 Campus Fraeternities Pledge 190 Men

 

Nineteen fraternities have wound up the spring rushing
derby by taking in a total of 190‘ pledges.

Pledging ten more than last year atthe same time,
the fraternities apparently were not handicapped by the
drop in freshman class enrollment. There were only 128
frosh‘ this year while 300 were on the books a year ago.

Pi Kappa Alpha grabbed off 23 new men to ﬁnish well
ahead of Theta Chi with 17. P1’

Religion does strange things
to people sometimes—ask the
PiKA’s.

As a part of Religion-in-
Life Week observances Mon-
day night they met with Delta
Zeta Sorority at the PiKA
house on Craig Street to hear
Father Gordon F. Knight
speak on ‘Mixed Marriage.”

After an hour the talk broke
up; but not for long. As
Father Knight stepped out
the front door to leave, sev-
eral men followed him out
and persuaded him to talk a
little bit more.

This small group of five ad-
journed to the third ﬂoor of
the house and talked right
through the regular PiKA
business meeting. Later others
joined in.

At midnight they stopped
brieﬂy for coffee and then
continued. The talk-fest ﬁnal-
ly stopped at 4:45 Tuesday
morning.

As one exhausted PiKA
said later, “We covered every-
thing!”

The Men’s Council Bookstore has closed after chalking

0

up a proﬁt of $150.

Bookstore manager Ronald Ecker said that the proﬁt
might have been higher if there had been no competition

from the University Bookstore.

Ecker stated that this was the
first year that the University
Bookstore sold used books, and
that they had copied the system
that the MC Bookstore has been
using.

Ecker" announced that post-
cards have been sent to students
whose books have been sold.
These students may pick up their
checks now in the dean of men’s
office. They must present their
pink receipts in order to get their
checks.

Students whose books can no
longer be used have been asked
to pick them up by Mar. 5, or the
books will become the property
of Men’s Council.

Students who have not been
notiﬁed about books left at the
store may have their books sold
in June or September. If the
books are sold, the students will
be notiﬁed.

Ecker also announced that the
Bookstore has been moved to 832

ilN0w Hear This

Even to you students of no faith; even to those of you
who profess agnosticism or atheism, this year’s Religion In
Life Week offers one of the greatest opportunities for edu-
cation for living that you can get out of any phase of your
study at Pitt. ' “

To us who have a faith of sorts, the words and ideas ex-
changed here this week can exert the greatest inﬂuence of

our entire lives.
=l=

Without going into all of the subjects and speakers
still to be heard today and tomorrow, we do want to call

=l= =l=

 attention to the last formal assembly of the week.

It takes place tomorrow in Foster Memorial Audit-
oriumfat 2:30 p.m., when Rabbi _Solomon Freehof is ‘go-\
ing to speak on “A Faith Worth Fighting» For.”

i The faith Dr. Freehof refers to is the faith that every
man, every nation, every religion has in itself. And just as
millions in Europe and Asia feel they have a cause worth

ﬁghting for, so must we ﬁnd our cause and ﬁght for it.
V :1: =3:

=l= .
Dr. Freehof, we are sure, has something to /say to all
‘of you.
We suggest that every faculty member who-has a class
thatphour consider seriously the merits of taking that class
in a body to hear Dr. Freehof. There are few courses, we

feel, that can offer anything of the importance of what he
has to say.

‘A Beard Grows In Pittsburgh

By usual. Lulsovsxfjfvfl

The theme for this year’s Spring Festival “Pitt Goes
West” can no doubt lend itself to a great many ideas, but
the best one I’ve heard so far is the beard growing contest.

To the Spring Festival Committee I say congratulations
on this brainstorm. At long last the women at Pitt will be
able to separate the men from the boys.

A beard does ‘so much for a man. It gives him a dis-

it saves him from about ten to
twenty minutes in the morning
when he could be getting his much
needed beauty rest, and it can
cover up a not too handsome face.

Strategic Camouflage

This latter is very important.
We all know that not every man
is blessed with the face ‘of, say,
Tyrone Power or Gregory Peck.
With a beard covering almost half
of a man’s face, no one need know
that he has a double chin or maybe
no chin at all. _

Right here it must be brought
out that Tyrone Power appeared
in “American Guerilla in the.Phil-
ippines,” and Gregory Peck ap-
peared in “Yellow .Sky” with

tinguished and sophisticated look,¢

beards. Even these handsome
specimens looked better (if possi-
ble) with whiskers. So to the al-
ready goodlooking Pitt men, imag-
ine the heights you can reach
with a beard.

A beard can bring out a man’s-

originality. A clever male with
the aid of a few bobby pins could
curl the ends of his growth and
create an unusual effect; another
whose hair doesn’t grow fast could
cultivate a goatee. There is prac-
tically no limit to the different
types of beards a man could grow.

Whoso Would Be a Man . . .

A man can show his individ-
uality by growing a beard. In our
present society it is the unfor-
tunate fact that most men don’t

have beards. If a man would ap-_

pear in public with a unique

growth and walk with his shoul-' ,
ders back and his head up high he‘:
would prove to the public that he:
is an individual and not a slave,
to the present fad of clean-shavenf.

faces.

I for one think that it is every
Pitt woman’s duty not to go out

with a man during the contest ufn-r_ 7

Of course the question is going;

some girls say that they don-’,t

think they would like to kiss a-
man with a beard. Let me »nowT

Profs Are Hardy Lot

By ED JENSEN I

I admire professors. They are a hardy lot.
y The man who follows the teaching trade in the States
in this year of 1951 has to have a lot more than just a couple
of degrees. Hehas to be more than just a learned scholar

and beneﬁcient pedagogue.

He has to, have a lot of some-
thing. Just exactly ‘what that
something is I am not sure. I do
know that it is composed of a
great many things. Certainly, it
must include some of that won-
derful, and all—too-rare substance,
courage. Along with courage I
should say he has to have a cer-
tain amount of integrity.

Probably no other ‘professional
group in the land is so often in
the national doghouse as are the
profs. They are mentioned almost
every time a congressional inves-
'tigating committee gets its paws
on some’ kind of an issue that in-
volves matters mental.

The profs have been charged
with almost every kind of skull-
duggery the learned solons can
concoct. They say our venerable
mentors are forever leading us

. astray, always corrupting us with

that foul idealogy, the Truth, al-
though it is referred to in differ-
ent terms.

Un-American Instinct

The truth of matter is that the
profs’ only deviation from the
true way, the American way, is
their lack of the acquis-itive in-
stinct. No other group is content
with so little of the national
wealth as the profs. They are al-
most suicidal in their avoidance of
money.

We have an example of this sui-
cidal tendency among our own
professors here on campus. The
other week the faculty hierarchy

if you are trying to ﬁnd your way
around the University. The print-

—..ed compass is great for computing
how many more days before the

next vacation, but don’t count on
it for directions. The truth of the

‘matter is that the great majority
,of students don’t know whether
"east is east or south is west.

Ask anybody in the Tuck Shop
where the Stephen Foster Memor-

iial is, and he will point to the

,lShop. Actually, that end of the
lTuck Shop faces Fifth Avenue,

b.ut, for some odd reason, most

fpeople think that it faces Forbes
tStre,et. The absolute lack of any
it-sense of direction in the Univer-
{sity is phenomenal.

Ask the Chancellor
:One gay blade told me that the

best way to get to the University
Post Ofﬁce was to go to the Chan-

cellor and ask him. The Post Of-
ﬁce was the place I wanted to ﬁnd.
The Tuck Shop was where I was
usually guided. All of which
proves that more post ofﬁce is
played in the Tuck Shopthan cof-
fee is served in the office of the
United States Mails.

“Turn left at the far end of the
Commons Room. Go down the hall
until you come to the elevators.
Go up to the eighth floor and get
off.”

“Is that where the Post Office
is?” » ~

“Well, not exactly,” he replied.
“But the mailman usually deliv-
ers a fresh case of cards every day
and you can ask him.”

Do you want to know how to
get to Ellsworth Center? One
young‘ lady felt that the best way‘
was to take a 73 Highland street
car until you came to Hunt Arm-

ory. Get off the car and walk a

few blocks left and you can’t miss

it. Not if you walk far enough,
that is.

Don't Ask Engineers -

The best answer of the day came
from a fellow student who
scratched his head thoughtfully
and replied “Sorry, bud, I’m an
engineer.” You can make of that
what you will.

Maybe it’s good that not too
many people ask directions. If they
did, a great congestion would
follow in the Dean of Men’s of-
ﬁce. Apparently Dean Biddle is
well thought of, for more people
told me to go to his oﬂice than

decided itwas time they let the
Trustees know they needed more
money. So they got together, dis-
cussed the issue and drew up a
report of their ﬁndings.

The report revealed that the
cost of living has, ‘ﬁguratively
speaking, joined the Air Force and
soared into the wild blue yonder
while their salaries had remained
in the prosaic infantry. The re-
port was then presented to the
chancellor who informed the profs
that their plight was known and
under consideration. That was all
there. was to it.

No Strike

No strike, no threat of picket-
ing, no plans to go before the La-
bor Relations Board. The’ report

was submitted and that was the
end. Now the profs have nothing,

to do but sit back and watch the
enrollment ﬁgures. ~
While they wait the cost of get-
ting food and board will continue
to soar. They will continue to
watch the Bureau of Labor Stand-
ards Index and submit reports.
But you have to admire their

ter. Then the Dukes began to co-
ordinate, and by the end of the
third period, they held a 12-point
lead, 47-35.

At that point the Mert attack
broke loose. With less than half
the closing period gone, the Mert
Five had torn through the Dukes’

the Duke lead to 48-46.

playoff game at Trees gym on

anxious Dukes continually threw

quickly took advantage of their

Mixers Upset
By Mert Five

A strong Mert Five defeated"an
equally strong Pharmacy Mixers
aggregation, 48-46, in a semi-ﬁnal
IM playoff game that was not de-
cided until the ﬁnal seconds of a
ﬁve minute overtime period at
Trees gym on Thursday.

The first half gave no indica-
tion of what was to come as both
teams started slowly. The Mixers
led at the end of this half, 18-13.

In the third quarter the Mixers
led at one time by ten points, but
the determined Mert team quickly
closed the gap and trailed at the
end of this quarter by only four
points, 30-26.

The action really got hot in the
fourth period when, with one min-
ute and 15 seconds to play, the
Merts led 40-39. A foul and a
quick ﬁeld goal by Harold Cath-
cart put the Mixers ahead, 42-40,
with thirty seconds remaining.

Jim_ Van Kirk saved the game
for the Merts as his two-pointer
with ﬁfteen seconds left sent the
teams into overtime play.

With less then a minute re-
maining in the overtime period,
and the score again knotted at
46-46, the Merts scored the win-
ning basket and then effectively
froze the ball. Primo Sette gar-
nered 21 points for the Merts and
Harold Cathcart scored 18 for the
Mixers.

Coach’s Son Unbeaten
In Argentine Games

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
America won the wrestling championship in the Pan-
American Olympic games at Buenos Aires, Argentina, last
week, and one Yank who helped insure the victory was
Pitt’s own frosh wrestling star, Hugh Peery.

The 19-year-old grappler,

son of wrestling coach Rex

Peery, won the 114.5 pound ﬂyweight title by registering
four consecutive victories—all by falls—over his Pan-Ameri-

can opponents. 6

Following his fourth win which
gave him the title, young Peery
immediately wired his father of
his victory and said he would 're-
turn home by plane Sunday.

Yanks Win Four

Peery’s victory was one of four
registered by the Americans, who
also captured two seconds to take
the championship.

Among those who fe1l)before
Hugh were Fiorivaldo Santanna

 

Hugh Rex

of Brazil, R. Davula Cardenas of
Mexico, and Manuel Barela of Ar-
gentina.

Hugh, who wrestled as a 123-
pounder for the little Panthers,
was undefeated in four starts be-
fore leaving for Argentina.

Another Peery

But Hugh isn’t the only Peery
making Papa feel mighty proud
these days. His other son, Ed, is
a championship winner in his own
right on the mats.

Last Saturday, Ed, 112-pound
sophomore a t t e n cl i n g Shaler
Township high school, captured
the WPIAL and Western Regional
championship at Waynesburg Col-
lege.

Young Ed, who is 15, will com-
pete for the PIAA championship
at Johnstown Saturday.

Meanwhile, Coach Peery named
ﬁve matmen to participate in the
Interstate Intercollegiate Indi-
vidual Invitational tournament at
Case Tech in Cleveland Friday
and Saturday.

The ﬁve are: John George (117),
Ray Cappelli (123), Harold Miller
(130), Frank Skirpan (147), and
Heavyweight Gail Ellis.

tLead Scorers

Pitt basketball for the 1950-51
season was buried Saturday when
Penn State’s Nittany Lions re-
venged an earlier loss by shellack-
ing the Panthers, 64-44.

The Panthers ﬁnished with a
season record of 9 wins and 17
losses. The t'reshmen’s 70-51 vic-
tory at State gave them a 10-3
season chart.

Mike Belich tallied 17 points at

— State, boosting his season scoring

total to 415, a new all-time Pitt
high.
Clarence “Dutch” Burch was the

leading frosh scorer with 177

points in 13 games.

Sports Editor
Members of Pitt’s sports family are getting to be quite

the television personalities.

Latest to appear on TV was Tom Hamilton, athletic

director, who aired his views 0110

the collegiate TV problem over
Channel 3’s “Pittsburgh Story.”

Doc Carlson and his ice-cream
eaters have made two appearances
on TV this season over Channel
13. Their second time out they
obligingly put on a good show by
upsetting the Army Cadets, 48-44.
Television Hifs .

Previously, the Pitt-Navy game
had been televised. .

One of the lucky individuals
who can get Johnstown on his set
reports that the Panthers can be
justly proud of their play on TV.

Pitt had its ﬁgure-eight weave
working to perfection, according

to our informer, and the game
commentator was high in his
praise.

Doc Deiecfed

Carlson did a solo earlier this
winter, just after his team had
returned from the disastrous west-
ern trip. The doctor was not his
usual effervescent self, sorry to
say. Seemed rather dejected some-
how.

We feel that he should be in-
vited back for another crack at
TV. Certainly his teams play in
recent weeks has the doctor in

The most unfortunate Pitt tele-

 

Avision performer was Dick Firsch—

ing, the‘Panther track captain who
competed in the IC4A indoor track
championships at Madison Square
Garden a week ago.

Firsching Flubs

Dick qualified for the 600-yard
run in the afternoon and was all
set for his big debut in the eve-
ning in the ﬁnals before thou-
sands of television fans all over
the country.

Came time for the 600 yard run.
The runners lined up on their
marks, got set, and off went the
gun.

But Poor Richard ﬂubbed his
TV chance——through no fault of
his own, however. A Colgate run-
ner stumbled and fell, and Dick,
hot on his heels, tumbled right

over the Colgate man——and right
out of the race.

For the thirteenth year since
baseball coach Ralph Mitterling
has been Chief Panther, the mitt-

the Stadium for spring training.

This year, as in the past, Mit-

has the opportunity to search for
suitable replacements to his var-

Graduation losses created only
one apparent weakness for Mit-
terling—pitchers.

I Tells of Flight From Reds

Korean Prof, Keller

By DAVE

WINTER

A reunion between two old friends who hadn’t seen each

other for 27 years was an unexpected by-product of a Reli-

gion—in—Life assembly Monday

afternoon.

The two men who renewed their friendship were Father
James Keller, Christopher founder who spoke here Mon-

day, and Dr. Louis Pal Chang,

ﬁne arts who recently arrived
dodging Communist killers in his.
homeland.

Students Together

Dr. Chang and Father Keller
first met when they were students
during 1923-4-5. Father Keller
was studying at the Maryknoll
missionary seminary at Ossining,
N. Y., and Chang was going to
Columbia.

One of the reasons why the
Reds were anxious to lay their
hands on Dr. Chang last year was
because his brother, John M.

visiting Korean professor of
at Pitt six months late, after

be shot because I was a Rightist
and a Catholic.” .

“I have eight children, and I
had a hard time with my family,
moving, shifting, all the time.”

Dr. Chang had decided to come
to Pitt as a visiting professor in
February, 1950, :~v.d had planned
to arrive here Sept. 15. When the
North Koreans attacked in June,
he says, “I was so conﬁdent about
the strength of the Korean gov-
ernment and of American support,

Renew Friendship

I never dreamt we would be

chased out.”
Hid in Suburbs

When the Communists invaded
Seoul, Dr. Chang hid for days in
the houses of Catholic friends in
the suburbs of the city. He stayed
indoors most of the time, know-
ing that his face was well-known,
and sometimes had to ﬂee from
house to house several times a
day, one step ahead of the Reds.
Sometimes he slipped out and
slept in the mountains at night,
without cover on the bare ground.

Two Christmases

On Christmas Eve, 1950, Dr.
Chang received word that he
would have to leave his family
behind and ﬂy to the U. S. He
took a plane from Pusan to Anch-

Chang, was then the South Ko-
rean ambassador to the United
States. (Last month, he was made
prime minister of South Korea.)

With only a slight, hesitating
accent, Dr. Chang tells the story
of his ﬂight from the Reds.

son, by the Communist standpoint,

Critic Says Playhouse

Production Misses Boati

By DICK SNYDER
In his staging of The Wedding, Playhouse director Fred-
erick Burleigh affirms what he hinted at last season with
“Captain Brassbound’s Conversion,” that, given the oppor-

tunity to tamper with Art, he can come up with a pretty
. ..

tiresome evening in the theater.
Mr. Burleigh has chosen a
plodding, dramaless, talk—heavy
fantasy by Poland’s Stanislaw
Wyspianski, and added sluggish
direction and casting that ranges
from satisfactory to muddling.

‘The Wedding’ has to do with a
brief hapless insurrection in a
small Polish village during a
Wedding in 1900.

SeniorMi:xes ‘Mike ’and Math

By BOB THOMAS

As you can see from the
picture at the right, Alan
Boal is a busy man.

A senior who will be 21 on
Friday, Boal is merely doing what
for him is all in a day’s work-—
except he is doing it all at once
for the beneﬁt of our Pitt News
photographer.

For Boal this ‘all in a day’s
work’ includes an eight-hour trick
at the microphone of station
WBVP, Beaver Falls, Pa., as well
as a full schedule of classes at
Pitt. C

Now in his third year as a staff
announcer at WBVP, this journal-
ism major with the barrel-chested
voice of an auctioneer puts in a
full forty-hour-plus week at the
station and has been doing it since
the end of his freshman year at
Ellsworth Center. ‘

Disk Virtuoso

At the same time he has become
sort of a virtuoso among disk
jockeys until he now runs record
4 shows ranging from popular to
it classic and from Italian, Polish,
"ff and Croatian to Serbian and Span-
‘ , ish. In fact Boal sends out over

the air every Sunday what he
calls “the only authentic Spanish
language program in this part of
the country—the “Latin-American
Hour.”

He learned to speak Spanish
ﬂuently at first hand during his
travel ’and schooling in Mexico

Hackenberg, advisor to student
publications, also will take part.
The panel was chosen to represent
different age and social groups at
the University.

Student Views Aired

The program is the second in
the radio series by Pittsburgh uni-
versities and colleges entitled,
“Manpower 1951: Education and
the National Emergency,” design-
ed to place before the community
the opinions of young, minds on
the national crisis.

The ﬁrst topic was, “The Draft

Fine Arts and Science Students,”
broadcasted by Carnegie Tech on
Feb. 28th. The succeeding topics
are, “Military Training Programs
in Colleges,” by Duquesne Uni-
versity, Mar. 14; “Should Women
be Drafted?” by Mount Mercy,
Mar. 21; “Women’s Contribution to
the Defense Effort,” by Pennsyl-

The programs will be aired
simultaneously over KQV and Du-

casting week Boal airs such shows
as ‘Polka Program’, ‘Variety Un-
limited’, ‘The Back Page’, and
‘Music You Want’-plus newscast-
ing and regular staff work. All
in all he has to please nearly
every type of audience—-the polka
fanatics, classic bugs, John Q.
(popular) Fan, and the listener
who merely‘ wants to get the
news.

To get everything done in a
week Boal has to chalk up some
300 miles of commuting, plenty
of hustle, and not too much sleep.
Studying he does between shows
at WBVP, so that he is usually
doing homework and preparing for
the next program at the same
time.

An overall ‘B’ average testifies
that it has workec‘. out pretty well.
