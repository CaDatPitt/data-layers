US. government says Pitt must pay

— Byjenna Ferrara

News Editor

Pitt owes the government about $75,000
for expenses wrongly" charged to
administrative overhead costs for federal
research grants  fiscal year 1990,
according toan audit completed Friday by
the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. .

The government had denied Pitt’s
proposal for new indirect—cost rates last
week. HHS official Stan Phillips said rates

Smoking ban
‘low priority’
of Pitt police

Byjeff S. Griffin
For The Pitt News

Seven months after its implementation,
the university—wide smoking ban remains
a low priority at Pitt’s Department of
Public Safety, according to the assistant

, director.

‘‘We’re not going out of our way to
enforce it because we have to answer the
calls of other crimes on campus,” said
Walt Waters, assistant director of public
safety. “Hopefully I'm not being too naive,
but we expect voluntary compliance.”

Waters said his department hasn’t issued
any citations since the policy went into
effect Feb. ' 1. ~

If a smoker repeatedly disregards the
ban, Waters suggests making a complaint
to a department head or the university
official in charge of the area in which the
violation occurred. , ,

The present policy designates smoking
and non-smoking areas in the academic,
laboratory and housing space of university-
owned buildings, said Larry Keller, director
of environmental safety and public health.

Keller said property leased to third parties
such as the Schenley Quad would not fall
under the policy’s guidelines.

“These would be up to management to
comply with city ordinances,” he said.

Keller said the current policy —— a

lower than those requested were set to get
back the $75,000.

Wllfried Daehnick, associate provost of
research, said the lowering of the indirect-
cost rates to recoup the $75,000 will lose
the university millions of dollars.

“The difference was referred to by
[Treasurer Edward Hunia] as $5 million,
but we don’t know exactly what it is  It’s
definitely millions of dollars  If they had
just decreased the indirect—cost rate by
[$75,000], it wouldn’t have hurt. $75,000

doesn’t’ar‘nount to much,” Daehnick said. I

Indirect—cost rates include the money

beyond the research grants. that the '

government pays for ge‘neral.university
overhead expenses such as libraries,
heating and administrative costs. The
indirect—cost rate is a percentage of these’
expenses that the government says are
related to research.

Daehnick said getting back the money
for the inappropriate expenses wasn’t the
only reason Pitt’s indirect—cost proposal
was rejected.

Coping on Campus

First-year anxiety is nothing to worry about

Welcome to the University of
Pittsburgh! These are exciting
words for entering students.
Starting college is something most
of you have been eagerly
anticipating for some time.

' Despite the excitement of this

time, however, many of you find
doubts beginning to creep in
about whether this is the right
setting for you.

Anxiety may also grow from
parental pressures, financial
stresses, career uncertainty,
separation from a high—school
sweetheart or fears about meeting
compatible friends.

These are all predictable fears,
and it is important to know that

 most incoming students share one

or more of these concerns.
Accepting this fact is one way of
reducing your stress.

If you can brieﬂy set aside your
own fears and take time to listen
to those around you, some of the

4 fear and aloneness that often

accompany entrance into a new
environment may pass.
‘ Another way to address the

   

pi. I {oerit
Gallagher

early jitters is to actively confront .

them.

You might, forinstance, decide
to stop asking yourself all those
“why” questions that are so
upsetting: “Why am I such a
baby? Why am I not meeting any

«new friends? Why am I so stupid?

Why did I choose this schedule?”
These questions are self-
ﬂagellating and never lead to a

solution.

If you can change your “whys”
to “whats,” you can begin to‘
reduce your anxious state. “What
can I do to get over these fears?
What steps can I take to feel
better about myself in this

Don’t stop with asking these
questions, however. Either
answer them, or determine to

By Lisa Tylak

For T be Pitt News

When \X/endy‘Brindle was having stress-
related stomach problems, her doctor
suggested she take a stress—management
course.

Brindle, a doctoral student at the
University of Pittsburgh, was unsure of
what to expect but was willing to try
anything.

She said the course she took from the
Student Health Service at Pitt helped her
learn to gain some control over her life.

“I would really highly recommend it to
people,” she said. ’

The stress~management program is one
of many programs offered free to Pitt
students to help them with their personal
problems. I

In the %tress program’ students are
educated about stress and different ways
of dealing with it.

They are taught to challenge thoughts
such as “I can’t do this!” which might
cause students even more unnecessary
stress.

“I did worry more than I should have
about things that I couldn’t do anything
about," Brindle said. I

According to Brindle, she learned many
useful things from the course, such as time
management.

She said she used to feel like she was
always running with no time to get anything
done. I

Since she has taken this course, she
said she has been _able to ﬁnd time
for everything she needs to do,
including exercising and walking to
school.

During the course students are also
taught relaxation techniques, such as deep-
breathing exercises and mental exercises,

such as imagining themselves lying on a.

beach».

“They incorporate these skills into their
daily lives,” said Shirley Haberman, health
education administrator for the Student
Health Service.

Beginning this term the Health Service
will be offering asmoking-cessation group.

There are various other support groups
offered, such as an eating-disorders group
for students with anorexia nervosa, bulimia
or any other unhealthy relationship with
food. » '

Rhonda Torninello, a co—facilitator of .

the group and a recovered bulimic, said
young women and men turn to food as a
way of dealing with other‘ problems in
their lives. ' 0

‘‘It’s socially accepted. We’re socialized
with food in a way that we aren’t with

-drugs and alcohol. _We’re socialized that
‘food can make us feel good,” T ominello

said. »
’Ihe_Health Service also offers help for
students who are facing drug and alcohol

problems.

Alcoholics Anonymous and 
Children of Alcoholics group meetings are‘ q  l “
held. weekly and are open to. all Pitt?

students.

Because of special requests from 

students, this year the ACOA group is
open to students who come from
dysfunctional families as well as alcoholic
families.

Whilezthese support groups can be very

helpful to some people, students who - . V
need more help ‘are referred to the . » —

counseling center/for more intensive
therapy.

Haberman” said the staff at the Student’ 
Health Service believes students’ well» i 7

being depends on their emotional, social

.. and spiritual health, as well as physical
"health. ' ' 

“That’s why we do more thanjust take

care of students when they get a‘ cold,” . 

Haberman said.

Audit
Continued from page 1
A $100,000 grant with a 47-

percent indirect cost rate would

leave $68,000 for the
researchers and $32,000 for
indirect cost expenses,

Daehnick said.

In effect, “the government
says, we give you $100,000
and then you_take out of it
what you need for the indirect-
costrate.” \ ‘

“Even if we were permitted
a higher rate, we wouldn’t
have changed it right away
because it would have
disrupted research,” Daehnick
said. ’

A high indirect-cost rate
would leave less money for
the researchers, according to
Daehnick.

The University of Pittsburgh
tries to strike a balance

, between the indirect and direct

costs, he said. ' I
Expenses such as travel costs

for» university. officials,

membership fees for
professional organizations and
entertainment were among the
$75,000 in disallowed
expenses.’

The audit conﬁrmed earlier ,
reports of. $528,681 - in ,
questionable general and-
administrative spending, of
which $75,178 was charged
against overhead for federal
research grants.

According to Daehnick, the
HHS was applying new
regulations retroactively.

The rules prohibiting the
expenditures weren’t in effect
when the expenses were made,
he said.

The auditors disallowed the
purchase of a wastebasket,
Daehnick said.

“They said a wastebasket
doesn't support research, but
would you want a lab without
a wastebasket?”

Rights (U.S. Department of
Education). .

“I tell every person who seeks
advice from" our office that they
have the right to file a complaint
outside the university,” Frampton
said. ' '

In addition to investigating

inquiries or grievances, the office
is responsible for educating the
university about affirmative-action
issues and sexual-harassment
policies and procedures. Since
the university must report to both
federal and state agencies, it is
the office’s responsibility to ensure
the university complies with
government guidelines that
ensure equal opportunity.

The office also reports the status
of the university’s affirmative-
action programs to the president.

“I   UCO not ‘a bunch of born-again Christians’



3‘?

By Diana McLaughlin

For The Pitt News

It’s a deathly boring Friday
night, so a group of friends gather
to liven it up. You know — walk
around, listen for police sirens,
hassle passersby with questions,
maybe even try to tip off a car
alarm.

Normal weekend activities for
some street gang, right?

But for the University Christian
Outreach?

Contrary to popular belief, the
UCO isn’t just “a bunch of born-

again Christians.” Last week’s

scavenger hunt (where the
participants had to tape—record

sounds like car alarms and police
sirens) was one of many activities
sponsored by the group.

“Because we do a lot of social
activities  they see that we do
have fun but are serious about
our faith,” said Bob Sette, a Pitt
graduate student who heads the
organization.

Other student leaders are junior

Jed Althouse, president, and,

sophomore Andrew Wilson, vice
president. .

Volleyball games and pizza and
sundae parties attracted about 35
first-year students to attend the
first meeting, bringing the current
membership total to over 80
Christians, mostly of Catholic or

quality Apple computers, according to Schatz.

Benedum Computing Lab received a second. LPS 40 laser
printer. David Lawrence Computing Lab has ordered but not yet
received a third LPS /10 laser printer.

The money to purchase the new computer equipment for all
labs came from five—year bonds purchased with the intent of
being used to upgrade computer and telecommunications
equipment on campus, according to Schatz.

Smoking
Continued from page 1
response to the overall campus
community seeking a smoke—free
environment — was a challenge

to execute.

“It was certainly hard in terms
that it was one of those policy
decisions which was widely
debated rigorously by many
groups,” he said. “There was also
expenses in signage and the
distribution of sufficient
information.”

Although designated smoking

areas dot the campus, many
University of Pittsburgh smokers
are unaware they exist.

“I just wish there was a place
within the building to smoke,”
said senior Jim Hayes. “I was
kind of upset when Roy Rogers

cut smoking out. I think it hurt-

business.”

Paul Kissel added, “They should ‘

have smoking lounges because
smoking is still legal. If you’re in
a room with other smokers, what’s
the harm?”

Sette considers this year’s
recruitment “a very good
response,” stressing that of 400 to
500 people who completed
surveys at the. Student Activities
Fair, half requested more
information about UCO.

Sophomore Becky Tedesco, a
UCO regular for three years, said,
“lt’s been a real support to me
through college because of a lot
of things you get confronted with.”

At UCO she said she found
students who didn’t care about
what everyone else was doing
and provided alternatives to
drinking and partying.

But the meetings aren’t all fun
and games. Students participate
in prayer, scripture readings,
songs and discussions about God.

“You’re surrounded by people
that are striving to have a better
relationship with God,” said Rick
Strom, a former Pittsburgh Steelers
quarterback.

‘‘It helps to make it stronger 
to make it more real,” Strom said.

“God just isn’t off in heaven

, somewhere,” Sette said. “I think

that’s ' what the message of
Christianity is about — to
acknowledge that God loves us
and wants to be involved with us
on a daily basis."

The .UCO as a whole doesn’t
speciﬁcally support other groups
such as Students for Life, a pro-
life organization. UCO leaders
said the group doesn’t have an
official stand on abortion.

Women 19 studies growing  

By Tammy Carothers
For The Pitt News

Director of women’s studies Susan Hansen said enrollment
in women’s studies at Pitt has seen a 74—percent increase since
1985.

Hansen said interest in the women’s studies program has
increased because more classes are being offered or cross-
listed.

returning women students, who have been exposed to these

issues  We want to encourage all women to take part in our -

studies,” Hansen said.

Being a political science professor for 11 years has made
Hansen aware that historically, women haven’t been asked
how they felt about politics, she said..

“Studies have proven that women want a lower defense
budget,” she said. According to Hansen, women, unlike many
men, realize that war is about shooting other people.

Hansen said there is strong evidence that the world would
be different if women were in more positions of power. Recent
reforms in health care, education, and abuse and battering of
women reflect the influence of women in politics, she said.

Hansen teaches three courses: Women and Politics, which is '

regularly offered; Religion and Politics, which is now in its third
year and American Public Policy. '

Hansen holds an undergraduate degree in history but was
discouraged to pursue any kind of graduate studies. “During

the 19603 society’s attitude was that a woman would be taking ,

a position that a man with a family should have.”

This and an increasing awareness ofwomen’s issues sparked
her interest to do further research. She specializes in the impact
of gender in academic disciplines and how women’s roles were
either ignored, distorted or underplayed.

Among her 30—plus scholarly articles is “State Differences on
Abortion Rights” in the May 1980 journal of Politics. This past
year she has written a revised version of this article for a
conference. The article, on reserve for her Women and Politics
class, will be published soon.

Hansen’s plans for the department include a performance by »

the Meg Terry Theatre Group scheduled for the spring.

Of course, it is impossible for the campus police to _

To ensure that smoking in campus buildings continues

If a campus police officer sees a smoker inside a campus

might be calmed down a bit. Since Feb; 1, when the _

waiting for the environmentalists to designate official

but life-threatening because of the recent studies that
show thousands of deaths are caused by passive smoking.

Smokers have been somewhat patient with the policy,
as a/walk around any campus building would indicate —
the presence of non-biodegradable cigarette butts has
escalated in the past seven months. _

It is time for the university to make a decision about
whether the smoking ban was worth the effort. Time and
money have been wasted since the implementation of the
program, which hasn't proven itself to the university

‘ community yet. When it does, it is a possibility that once,
‘ just once, the Pitt campus can form a compromise through
the administration. ‘

This is now my fourth year
here at Pitt, and in my tenure here

I have come to the conclusion I

that the vast majority of students
here are stupid. '

Well perhaps not really stupid,
but they’re definitely naive. Not
until they become victims of crime

" do most of them give serious

thought to how to protect
themselves and their property.
While there are a lot of things one
should pay attention to, the top
two on the list have to be keeping
your dorm or apartment door
locked and keeping your ID
separated from your keys.
Common sense should tell you
that in the time it takes for you to
sing the complete Led Zeppelin
repertoire in the shower, some
punk could be creeping into your
unlocked ‘room to ﬁnance his
education with stolen
merchandise. And the only thing
worse than coming back to your
room to ﬁnd that someone was
there and gone would be to find
that someone hadn’t gone. I’m
sure a great percentage of campus
burglaries and rapes are blamed,
partially, on unlocked doors.
Your door should always be
locked._Lock it even if you are

Rob
Lewis

just running down the hall to
borrow a highlighter. When I lived
in Lothrop Hall I learned to lock
the door when I was in the room,
too — to keep out a greasy geek
named, Stu, who wandered the
building all night and bothered
people.

Another stupid move is buying
those contraptions at the

__ bookstore that attach room keys

to your university ID. If you are
thinking of buying one, don’t. If
you've bought one already, get
rid of it, because this is one of the
most senseless and dangerous
items I have ever seen sold.
Think about it. If you‘ should
happen to lose your keys, your
university ID goes with them.
You nowvhave to face the twin
hassles of getting a lock change
and replacing the ID card (which
costs a total of $35; $25 for the
lock change, $ 10 for the ID). This
will probably mean days of waiting
around for lockout service and
using a temporary card to eat in

to danger

the dining halls.   e
To make matters worse, the
card could be found (or stolen)

 by a person who could then find

out where you live, get into the
building (those desk guards don’t
generally check the photos on
the cards too carefully), unlock
your door and_rob you blind. Or
worse. And this is not just
theorizing.

I know people who have been
victimized this way. It's no secret
that college campuses are hotbeds
of criminal activity and that college
students are quite likely to be
victimized in some way. Why
give a helping hand to the
collegiate criminal by practically

handing over to him your name,
address and the keys to your
place? _

Follow the old advice about
not putting your name or address

on your keys. Keep your keys .

separate from your ID, and for
God’s sake don’t save seats in the
dining hall with them. And keep
your confounded door locked.
Not doing so is stupid and
dangerous, plain and simple.

Unfortunately Israel's small

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, September 10, 1991

C beers turn to fears

Some of my fondest memories are from high school. Dances.
Parties. Friends. Football games and  murder. Yes, murder.
Every now and then I hear things about my alma mater that
make me realize that times are changing. But times in Harrison

City, Pa. aren’t changing as
rapidly as they are in . _
Chrissy
Cortazzo .

Channellview, Texas.
Activities that are meant to
show school spirit are taken
to theextreme. Football camps
last for weeks, and specialists

girls on the proper cheering techniques. Nothing can quite
compare to the events that happened in the small town of
Channellview, Texas.

Let me set the scene for you. Shauna Holloway and Amber
Heath were best friends since kindergarten; they were even
neighbors. There was one thing that always stood in the way
of their friendship, though ——.cheerleading. Amber and Shauna
were both competitors for the hi gh-school cheerleading squad.

Since Amber had beaten Shauna in the past, Wanda Webb

‘Holloway (Shauna’s mother) decided to take matters into her
own hands. Instead of doing something rational like hiring a
private coach or enrolling Shauna in gymnastic lessons, Mrs.
Holloway decided to hire a hit man to murder Amber and her
mother, Verna Heath. .

You might be asking yourself, “How does a woman go about
hiring a hit man?” Well, that’s easy. You keep it all in the family
and go to your former brother-in-law, Terry Lynn Harper and
ask for his advice.

To begin with, Harper admitted that he didn’t think he knew
anyone that would kill a child. When “the ultimate stage
mother” (Holloway’s new nickname) heard this, she decided
to only have Verna Heath killed for the bargain price of $2,500.
Holloway figured that Amber .would be too emotionally
distraught to try out for cheerleading if her mom had just died.

What Harper didn’t‘rea1ize is that Holloway was dead serious
(no pun intended) about her plans. Holloway tried to reach
Harper a few months later, after which he went to the police.
Harper did so “to cover me if anything happened to this woman
and little girl.”

The police later wired Harper and made tapes of five
conversations between Harper and Holloway aboutthe murder
plot. In one of the conversations Holloway offered a pair of
diamond earrings valued at $2,000 as a down payment for the
job.

Holloway was arrested and tried for solicitation of murder
and solicitation of kidnapping. After six hours of deliberation,

she was found guilty on the murder charge and could face up ‘

to life imprisonment for her crime.

- Think about this for a minute. This woman is going to jail
because of cheerleading. Not because her children were
starving, and she robbed a grocery store to feed them. Not
because she robbed a bank to save the homeless, but for
cheerleading.

One has _a hard time believing or understanding some of the ,

things that go on in this world. We now haveto worry about
whether or not our rival’s mother is going to have us knocked
off at the next “friendly” cheerleader tryouts.

If Mrs. Holloway’s highest expectations were for Shauna to
make the cheerleading "squad, and she felt that she had to kill
anyone that got in her way, imagine if Shauna were to enter the
job market or, better yet, be a competitor for the title of Miss
America. Just picture it — one by one, all of the contestants
would die, leaving Shauna to claim the crown and $250,000 in
cash and prizes. R

You would think that people would feel a great sense of
pride and accomplishment when they managed to do something
on their own. If my parents pulled strings or even killed
someone so I could get what I wanted, I don’t think I would

Television encourages alcohol abuse

During the summer it seemed that every other
commercial on TV revolved around beer. However
now that the football season is in full swing, it’s
gotten worse.

Budweiser. Miller Genuine Draft. IC Light. Rolling
Rock. You name it; t.here’s a commercial for it, and
rest assured, it will be shown every 15 minutes.

The constant reminder that beer is nearby not
only entices the over—21 crowd, but it also influences
the younger kids of this world. Now I’m not talking
about the 16- to 20-year-old drinking crowd. I’m
talking about the YOUNGER ones: the 8, 9 and 10
year olds. The same ones who are being brainwashed
into chanting “Say No To Drugs” on command are
also viewing half-dressed females and bare-chested
men “tapping into the cold.”

Beer commercials have been glorifying alcohol
abuse for years. Advertisers may be attempting to
target the of—age crew, but their ‘ads are having an
adverse affect on children. '‘

T ruthfully, when I was, say, 14, I would see beer
commercials on TV and be enthralled by them. This
whole country is in.a race to grow up faster, and
what could make anyone feel older than drinking?
New Jersey law (and most other states for that
matter) declares 21 the legal drinking age. Underage
drinking has almost become a national pastime,
and almost everyone on this campus has at least
one ‘l‘you—can’t-beat-it” story about how they

obtained alcohol while underage. Hell, half the fun -

of underage drinking (besides having tales and
memories of the night’s adventures) is not getting
caught.

In the Jan. 29, 1990 edition of TV Digest, it was
determined by the Department of Health and
Human Services that, “Research has yet to document
a strong relationship between alcohol advertising
and alcohol consumption.”

Please, folks, let’s be realistic. OK, here’s my own
little parallel. . ' ~

Imagine: You're on a diet, but you have a five

dollar bill in your possession. Afte/r__a ,daylof_hard,

classes and only a salad for lunch, most of your
willpower is drained. You ﬂick on the TV andare
face—to-face with a Snickers bar. (If you'don’t like

Lisa Raff

Snickers, insert the candy bar of your choice here.)

7-Eleven is only a hop, skip and a jump away, so

you bound over to the deadly convenience store ‘- 

and purchase the high-calorie treat.

Now imagine this: Your apartment is hotter thanl

a 976 number on a Saturday night

The only slightly refreshing liquid in your apartment 0

is water. You turn on the TV and come face—to-face
with an ice-covered bottle that is “cool and refreshing
as a mountain stream." Again you have five bucks
to spare. Stress question: What do you do?

Like most Americans, you go out and buy a beer,
right? Right. »

-And underage folk, what do they do? They go out ' 9

and have someone buy it for them.

HHS, in 1984, had produced a study which
stated, “Reducing the use of glamorization of
alcohol in the mass media, or at least emphasizing
the realistic portrayal of the negative consequences
of consumption, is believed to be a useful prevention
method." ' ‘

It baffles me how a department so concerned
with human safety can even suggest that, in the past
six or seven years, alcohol abuse has not increased

due to advertising. . I 
Not to be a martyr, but the world has been going,
downhill. Kids are glued to MTV, which, I have.

observed, has the most advertisements for alcohol.
Ironically these ads for beer are most often followed
by a father questioning his son, “Where did you get

this stuff? Who taught you how to use this?" or. .» "

something to that effect. Our nation's hypocritical
belief is that marijuana, cocaine, crack and heroin
are not in the same league with alcohol. Wrong.
Alcohol, too, is a drug".

But are children being taught that fact? Yes, they
are —but most programs that deal with alcohol and

Pittsburgh Students for Peace At
Any Cost.

Erin Bush from PSfP told me
that the “demands” they made
last spring to ex-President Wesley
Posvar have not yet been made
to new President J. Dennis
O’Connor because he is difficult
to reach. I

What PSfP “demanded” was
the immediate removal of the
Reserve Officer Training Corps
from campus, the banning of
armed forces recruitment and
the refusal of any military funding
directed toward Pitt. I know, I
know; this is ridiculous. So let us
examine exactly what these

' a misguided souls want.

First they want ROTC booted
off campus. Never mind that

between the Army and Air Force, J

over 200 studentstake part in’ the

I program, and the number keeps

increasing each year. And I guess
PSfP doesn’t give a hoot about
the many students who are on
full scholarship and would have
their lives tremendously
disrupted if ROTC were removed.
Why should students from this
area who wish to serve their
country be forced to attend distant
colleges because some out-of-

many students’ lifelong wishes?
Maybe PSfP and BiGALA should
merge into one, hypocritical
group. \ _

Second, PSfP doesn’t want
military recruiters operating on
campus. That is absolutely asinine!
Recruiters have the same right to
be on campus as any business
representative.

There are many students who
may be thinking of joining the
service, and they have a right to
examinegtheir options and speak
with a recruiter. I was told by Erin
Bush that PSfP thinks that the
presence of recruiters helps to
“militarize" the campus. I_don’t
see any tanks or artilleryroaming
Oakland, so I guess we can forget
that one. ' . '

Third, PSfP wants Pitt to refuse
any military funding for research
projects. I wonder if these folks
learned anything from the quite
necessary beating Iraq suffered a
couple ‘of months ago. It is
because of our superior weaponry
that so few Americans lost their

lives. And how do you get such‘

weapons? That's right. It’s because
we invested millions of well-spent
dollars in research to develop

‘ them.
It’s ironic that PSfP wants.

d{Y€¢‘h‘..‘

 

-..°.."’.°. ..

The more research, the better.
The’ security of America is of
utmost importance, and I feel
that PSfP is ignoring centuries of
historical precedents that illustrate
the need for a strong national
defense.

It’s quite hypocritical for PSfP
to assert its right to protest and
hold activities on campus while
simultaneously demanding that a
very important part of _our society
be excluded. ROTC and recruiters
have every right to be a part of
campus. ' '

I sincerely hope that new Pitt
President J. Dennis O'Connor

won't cave in to a very small but =

very vocal special— interest group;

According to polls conducted by . 0 ’
the Pitt News during the Persian‘ 9
Gulf war, the overwhelming

majority of Pitt students disagree
with PSfP.

' So the next time they protest,
speak your mind! PSfP may have
noble goals and truly believe in
their efforts, but “ﬂower power”
and unilateral dis-armament will

never be able to ensure our,
national security. Only a large,

well-equipped and well-trained
rnilitarywill. Gives you something
to think "about.

Women’s Cross country opens season with win while men falter“

By Keith Dowling

' For The Pitt News

The women’s cross—country team started
its season with a‘ surprise win this past
Saturday at the Marshall University
Invitational while the men opened their
season with a loss.

Overcoming a small budget, a small
team and a relentless fog that rolled in
from the Ohio River that morning, the
Lady Panthers outran Eastern Kentucky by
a close 48-54 score. ,

Leading the pack was junior Carmela
Mariani, who ﬁnished third overall in 18:33
for the 5,000-meter course. Junior Laura
O’Donnell followed in 18:34 for fourth,
with senior Stacy Wyzykwoski finishing

fifth in 18:35. Rounding out the top ﬁve
were senior Jen Hrach’s 11th place ﬁnish
andJudy Facey’s 25th. Rio Grande’s Renee
Peck won the invitational with a time of
18:09.

“They did it themselves,” said head coach
Jim Lear. “The team ran the early pace
conservatively and worked together. They
seem to run well despite the obstacles
against them.”

Unfortunately the men’s team couldn't
handle its own obstacles, despite an easy
win by senior Jason Bodnar. The harriers
began their season with a second-place
finish to Eastern Kentucky, 55-62.

“Now they have to work to be good,”
said Lear. “I think they realize that they
can’t live off of last year’s team.”

 

Easier said than done. The 1990 men’s
cross-country team had a ground-breaking
season that peaked with a 17th place ﬁnish
at the 1990 NCAA Championships. But
after losing three seniors to graduation and
with several members new to the pressures
of being key runners on a nationally ranked
team, this year’s team may have an uphill
battle to qualify for the 1991 NCAA
Championships in Arizona this November.

“Nationals won’t be easy,” said senior
Mike Formica, who ﬁnished Saturday’s
race as Pitt’s second man and placed
fourth overall. “I know we’ll have better
races than this one. I think this loss will
help us focus more as a team."

Bodnar outsprinted West Virginia

‘ University's Bob Donker to win the five-

mile race in 25:24. Bodnar is positive about
the team's outlook despite its loss. “I think
the team is where [it] ought to be,” Bodnar
said. “We want to be one of the best teams
in the country at the NCAA’s in November,
not one of the best in early September.”

Rounding out the top ﬁve were senior
Steve Forrester’s 17th-place ﬁnish, along
with junior Tom Swartout’s 19th placing,
and graduate student Craig Woshner’s 21st
place finish. _ . f

This Saturday’s race at Penn State's Spiked
Shoe Invitational will challenge both the
men’s and women’s teams with even better
competition than at Marshall. Penn State,
Shippensburg, ‘West Virginia and the
University of South Florida should provide
the Panthers with a new obstacles.

Pitt aims to restock
its Wares with top

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

The game behind college
;,£g9tl2a1l..is...r.esnii1ing.---.._. .. ._
in, The annual process of luring
high-school players to attend
collegesaround the nation is as
important to a coach as viewing
films of upcoming opponents.
With today's technical prowess,
recruiting has become a national
endeavor. One look at the current
Pitt roster will prove that:
Although 57 Panthers come from
Pennsylvania, 10 are from Florida,
‘eight are from Texas and an
additional six are from California.
Pitt even has a Canadian player
on the roster.

The ﬁrst, or early, signing period
comes in November. Even though
that’s two months away, colleges
have been hot on the trail of high-
school seniors for months now.
This year seems to be an excellent
year for all the skill positions and
also for down linemen. Western
Pennsylvania’, as usual,’is turning
out another good collegiate crop.

Paul Hackett had a good ﬁrst
-recruiting class a year ago (Tom
Tumulty, Curtis Martin), and Pitt
will have a few holes to ﬁll on the
offensive and defensive lines
(where all of this year’s starters
are juniors or seniors), in the
secondary, at tight end and at
outside linebacker. OLBs Ricardo
McDonald, Curtis Bray and
Nelson Walker are all seniors this
year. >

Of course it never hurts to get

A players at the skill positions, and

Pitt could use a fullback or two
for the future.

One of the best area players is
offensive tackle Jeff Craig of
Connellsville. Craig, listed at 6
foot, 6 inches and 285 pounds, is
one of the nation's top-line
prospects. Accordingly, besides
Pitt, tall the big schools are
interested: Michigan, ,Notre

high school seniors

Dame, Florida. Craig is also
reported to be atop student, which

' increases his popularity among

colleges. -

Other top area players that "Pitt _

is interested in, include safety
Richard Brooks of Penn Hills,
lineman Jamaal Crawford of Erie,

running back Essex Law of«

Rochester and quarterback Steve‘
Taneyhill of Altoona.

Pitt has had recent recruiting
success in Virginia, ‘Texas and
Californiaand is recruiting several
players from those states.

Current Panthers Keith
Hamilton, Jimmy Morrison,
Reuben Brown and Vince
Williams all hail from Virginia;

‘Brown and Williams both

attended E.C. Glass High School
in Lynchburg.

Now Pitt is after Glass receiver
Curtis Anderson, as well as
lineman Quincy Wynn
(Chesapeake) and Ronell
Williams, who is one of the biggest
defensive line recruits in the
naﬁon.

Huntingdon Beach, Calif., has
been good to Pitt recently.
Offensive linemen Lawson
Mollica and Mark Fely both hail
from that locale. This year
Huntingdon Beach has receiver
Brandon Jessie, the son of ex-pro
star Ron Jessie. At 6-6 and 215
pounds, Jessie has attracted
attention from USC, UCLA,
Colorado and Notre Dame. He is
also a star basketball player, and
that could ﬁgure into his collegiate
plans. I

Texas is famous for producing
skill players, and this year receiver
Mike Adams is one of the best in
the state. Nicknamed “the Missile”
because of his 4.35—second 40-
yard time, Adams is on the list of
Colorado, Houston, Florida and
Virginia, in addition to Pitt.

There are many talented
linebackers this year, and Pitt is
after oneof the best in the nation,

Paul Diarnond/The Pitt News

Pitt is hoping it can ﬁnd talented players like Curtis Martin, who is playing as a true freshman this year.

Ken Times of Winter Park, Fla.
Unfortunately Florida State,

Florida and Miami are hoping
Times will stay in-state, so the
Panthers have an uphill battle.
Other linebackers on Pitt’s list
include Donell. McDonald of
Charlotte, N.C., Jon McCray‘of
Akron, Ohio andJames Cuttino of

Mt. Vernon, N.Y.

Pitt’s 1991 secondary includes
_two senior cornerbacks in Steve
Israel and Dave Coleman. With
Tinker Harris seemingly ready to
grab one of those spots, high-
school CB5 aren’t a huge concern,
but Pitt is in on a few players,
including Brian Penecale, from

Central Bucks East High in eastern
Pa., QB-convert Charles Young
of Atlanta, Ga., and Jim Lynn of
Sarasota, Fla.

On the offensive line, in
addition to Craig, Pitt is recruiting
Doug Morgan of Mentor, Ohio.

When Tim Sobelman walked
into Pitt Stadium as a first-year
student four years ago, he
wondered what it would be like
to be the starting goalkeeper for
the Panther soccer squad.

Today his wondering has
ceased, because this season he

will lead the squad as the starting.

goalkeeper.

Sobelman began his soccer
career in the fourth grade in his
home town of Ephrata, Pa. He
continued to play soccer
throughout high school, and it
was there that his love for the
sport grew into fruition.

Upon his arrival at Pitt he was
awarded a position on the team
as a walk—on. As fate would have
it, he ended up sitting out his first
season as a redshirt due to the
team’s depth at his position.

In his second year Sobelman
became a part time starter. “It was
tough trying to get" used to the
college game,” he said. “The level
of play is much harder than in
high school.”

Last year Sobelman "again
shared the duties with then—senior
Jay Kapusta. Of his competition
with Kapusta Sobelman said, “It
was good competing with Jay.
We always had to work hard; we
were always pushing each other."

As a part—time starter last year
Sobelman played in many of the

Panthers’ Big East Conference

games. At the conclusion of the
season Sobelman had a stellar

,- 0.51 goals against average, good

enough to win him the title for
lowest GAA in the conference.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Ihesday, September 10, 1991

W/éll/6-O7“l starts at keeperfor Pitt

GAA is a statistic designed to
display a goalkeeper’s ability to
prevent goals.

Sobelman remembers the hard
work it took to reach that
milestone. “The highlight of my
career so far was beating Syracuse
at the end of the season last year.
I knew that I had the GAA title on
the line because I only led (Charlie
Wilkie) by a few percentage
points. I knew that if I lost the
game, I would lose the title.”

As it turned out there was no
need to fret‘ as Sobelman and his
Panther teammates shut out the
Orangemen 1-0, thus earning fifth
place in the conference, one point
shy of a playoff berth.

This year with the reins in
Sobelman’s hands, the Panthers
have jumped out to a 1-0 record
with a 2-0 victory over Geneva

College, a game in which

Sobelman got an assist on a pass
to Ted Noethling, who scored
the goal.

As a student at Pitt Sobelman
has managed to perform well, as
he juggled his duties as president
of the Civil Engineering class,
being a founding father at Phi
Sigma Kappa fraternity and
playing soccer.

One person who Sobelman
eagerly heaps praise on is his
former goal coach, Bobby
Cambell.

“Bobby has been an integral
part of my development as a
college player. He has improved
my playing ability by 200
percent.” He later added, “This
year we'll miss Bobby’s vast
experience and presence.”

Of the upcoming season
Sobelman, who now makes his

 

home in Placerville, Calif., is
expecting a lot from his
teammates. “The defense will play
a major role for this team and in
my success. If they play smart and
tough, then it makes my job a
whole lot easier,” Sobelman said.

Of his duties as starting
goalkeeper Sobelman is very
excited for the upcoming season.
“While I finally have things to my
own here, we always have people
competing here, and they are all
playing well,” Sobelman said.

Another key to the season
according to Sobelman is the
steady play of senior co-captain
Nick Liberati. “He plays harder
than anyone I have ever played
with,” Sobelman said.

He also credits many other
teammates with being key role
players. They include co-captain
Mike Watson, first-year player Erik
Prex, senior Don Overmeir,
sophomore Ted Noethling and
senior Ivan Amayo.

Last year the Panthers were
picked to finish last in the Big East
"Conference and wound up
finishing a very respectable fifth
place.

This year Sobelman and his
teammates have a brighter
outlook on the upcoming season.

“Last year,” Sobelman said, “We
could practically taste (the
playoffs), and this year we still
have. that memory of being so
close.

"Realistically our goal is to make
it to the Big East Championship. It
would be the icing on the cake for
me to win it all,” Sobelman said.
