Pitt students must follow the
Student Code of Conduct at all
times during the G—2o Summit,
whether they are on campus or at
the event Downtown, according
to a spokesman. .

 

Thestudent Code of
Conduct applies to Pitt
students wherever they

go.

Both locations have hosted the G—2o.
Delaney said he couldn’t comment of
the speciﬁcs of their discussions but
thathe“tooksome positive pointsfrom
their experience.” '

Lloyd saw how police dealtwiththe
protesters in London and said, “The
idea that protesters incited a riot is ut-
terly ridiculous.”

Shortly after Tornlinson’s death,
the Metropolitan Police released a
statement saying that protesters were
throwing objects at officers as they
surrounded and tried to revive Tom-
linson. But when the video footage
was released, Commissioner Sir Paul
Stephenson changed his tone.

“The images that have now been
released raise obvious concerns,” Ste-
phenson said in a statement ‘And it is
absolutely right and proper that there
is a ﬁill-investigation into this matter,
which the Metwill ﬁrlly support.”

tion. Lloyd attended as an oﬂicial legal
adviser and described Climate Camp
as more ofafestivalthanaprotest. The
groups’ members held workshops and
gave speeches about climate change.

In London, protesters do not need
to obtain permits. Organizers need
only to inform police of their actions
beforehand. Climate Camp followed
this procedure.

But the police contained everyone
in the area for hours without letting
anyone leave to get food or go the
bathroom, according to Lloyd, who
was there with some members of Par-
liament, also known as MPs.

. “We were given reassurance that
members ofdte media andMPswould
be able to move freely,” he said.

Lloyd and MP Tom Brake were

“Iwasthereinthe crowdas anob—

“I saw police smashingpeoplewith
their shields against their heads and
using the sides of their shields to bash

“Thesewerepeoplewhohadtheiranns ~

“People were sitting on the ﬂoor
saying ‘This is not a riot,’ and the po-
lice were actually stamping on them,”
he said.

London-based Imperial College sm-
dent Maria Rathbun said she believes
that the police were the ones acting
foolishly, not the protesters. —

to be that it was the police who pro-

into the G-2o,” Rath-
bun said Rathbun, a
global studies major,
had intendedto goto
the protests outside
an RBS bank, but of-
ﬁcers wouldn’tlether
near the area.

V Lloyd said that
months before the
summit occurred,
police used their re-
sources to set a nega-
tive public mood to-
ward the protesters,
citing‘ a February -
article that ran in
The Guardian — a
British daily newspa- -
per —— where police
wamedthe public of a

Superintendent \
David Hartshorn,
who heads the Met-
ropolitan Police’s public order branch,
told The Guardian, “We’ve got G-20
coming, and I think that is being ad-’
vertisedon some ofthe [activist’s] sites
as the highlightofwhattheysee as a
‘summer of rage.”’ T

He said that the rise in unemploy-
mentwouldleadtomone angryandvio-
lentprotests.And onApril1inLondon,
that is exactly what happened.

Lloyd believes the attitude toward
the protesters was partly to blame, as
the police used brieﬁngs to convince
people thatthe protesters were simply
outto cause harm.

“Policewererunningmeetingswith
companies for how to protect them-
selves against the protesters,” he said.

,,§ about the Student Code of Conduct be-
2087 - Mon.-Fri.

cause students she spoke with last year

    

To protest responsibly, students should
obey all federal, state and local laws and
obey any police directions, according to
the code. Destroying property or endan-
gering people’s safety also violates the Stu-
dent Code of Conduct, Humphrey said.

She encouraged students to be appro-
priate and responsible in their protests,
should they decide to become involved.

Students who violate federal, state or
local laws may be brought before the stu-
dent judicial system, Humphrey said.

However, a conviction of a crime that
violates the code is not necessary to bring
a student into the student judicial sys-
tem. The student judicial system works
off evidence presented by police or an
investigation, not on convictions made by
an outside court, Humphrey said.

She added that the University’s Judi-
cial Board won’t necessarily wait for civil
courts to complete a case, and it may begin
its process before a case is ﬁnished in an
outside court.

The Student Code of Conduct says that
the violation of any local, state or federal

. law also violates the code.

More serious infractions of the code -
such as directly endangering a student’s
own safety or that of someone else -
might result in immediate action by the
Office of Student Affairs, Fedele said".

Those immediate actions are only an in—

the Judicial Board, Humphrey said.

The safety tips advertised by the Uni-
versity advise students to carry their IDs
at all times, lock doors when entering or
leaving a residence and travel with others
at night. These tips are very similar to
those that Carnegie Mellon issued to its
students early last week."

Editorial

Extended warfare blurs
line between conflicts

resident Barack Obama is
Previewing a commander’s

assessment that could po-
tentially add tens of thousands of
troops to the burgeoning military
conﬂict in Afghanistan. The re-
port, submitted by Gen. Stanley
McChrystal to Defense Secretary
Robert Gates, warns that “resourc—
es will not win this war, but under-
resourcing could lose it.”

Public support wanes for this
once-popular war, and the acti-
vation of more troops will surely
disrupt the education of many en-
listed college students.

While the war in Iraq is under-
standably controversial, the Amer-
ican citizenry needs to stave off
war fatigue. This will be diﬂicult,
especially given that The New York
Times projects the general’s pro-
posal to request 10,000 to 45,000
troops, in addition to the 68,000
already approved.

It will disrupt more lives and
send many soldiers to their deaths.
It will also confuse many family
members who sit at home wonder-
ing why, eight years later, a super-
power is struggling to win against
a rudimentary insurgency which
ﬁghts from caves.

There have been 1,400 ca-
sualties in Operation Enduring
Freedom — the ofﬁcial title of
the military action —-— and at $65
billion, the budget request for
Afghani operations eclipsed the
request for activity in Iraq for the
ﬁrst time ever.

More troops might work, but

then again it might not —- Obama

"acknowledges that he won’t ap-

prove more troops until he sees
a strategy. Less troops will surely
result in disaster, and the current
strategy is failing.

Outside of some Sun Tzu read-
ings or reﬂection on past wars,
most citizens do not have a com-
prehensive understanding of war-
fare — much less modern warfare.
Unfortunately, this results in a
blurring of the differences between
the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The Afghani problem has no
historical reference point. It can-
not be solved mathematically, as
citizens are wont to think of war
because employing more troops.
does not ensure success; Gen. Mc-
Chrystal admits as much himself.

It is what happens with those
troops that matters, and thank-
fully Obama said he will not make
a decision on activating more sol-
diers until a concrete strategy is
ready. Gen. Mcchrystal alludes to
less search-and-destroy missions
in favor of protecting Afghani citi-
zens.

This rhetoric is starting to
sound familiar: They stand up
and we stand down. This makes it
even harder for people to remem-
ber that Iraq and Afghanistan are
two very different conﬂicts in two
very different countries.

As we revitalize the public dis-
cussion, let us recall the lessons
learned from Iraq —- but not forget
that we are in Afghanistan for a
very different reason.

Green demands cat

In a dog-ea.t—dog world, Princess Sugar.Pie reigns supreme

Molly Green
Columnist

 

It’s hard to be a cat person in a dog-
person world. '

Everywhere you can see the over-
whelrningly dog-loving inﬂuence. Pet-
related billboards, advertisements or
photographs are more likely to show-
case a dog than a cat. Movies like “All
Dogs Go to Heaven” and “Cats and
Dogs”vilifyca1sasevil,while glorifying
dogs as some furry, drooling Captain
America icon.

These images — propaganda, re-
ally —- ﬁirther perpetuate the “Dog
Complex,” which is quite similar to
the “God Complex" in its delusion-
to-reality ratio, so that if one does not
succurnbtocanine hegemony, tiieyare
thoughtof as cold, unfeelingpeople. Or
they are told that one day, they will die

smell of Fancy Feast cat food.

Some people think cats are un-
American. Lately I’ve heard the word
“socialist” thrown about a bit (admit-
tedlyinajol<ingmanner).'I‘hisisironic,
howeveigbecauseijustwantedtnopoint

outthatthe supposedly red—white-and-
blue-forever dogsarethe onesthathunt
in packs, share food and tend to one
another’s wounds. ’ ,

Cats are act11allyvery independent
animals. Theyarecumﬂng, andwould
probably turn on one another to get
morelfood. Cats are self—reliant. .It’s
actually very American. Dogs, on the
other hand, are almost helplessly de-
pendent on their “master.” Also, have
you everheard someone referto acafs
owneras his master? Ifthe doglifestyle
isn’t some kind of Pet Welfare, I'don’t
know what is. They -receive all of their
food, exercise and medications from
its master; i.e., the government. At least
cats are capable of catching their own
food. '

Yes, the tyranny of the dog—ob—
sessed masses is everywhere. The most
recent example is the Tuesday night
dog-therapyprograminthe Cathedral
of Learning.

Iwentto this program — dragged

Yes, I am talking about weekly cat
therapy- ~

Before you tell me cats don’t have
the personality to act as therapy ani-
mals, I would advise you to check out

the November2007 issue of Cat Fancy ‘

Magazine, which tells the heart-warrn-
ingstory of a schizophrenic patientwho
was aided by cattherapy. Or check out
“famous therapy and show cat” Prin-
cess Sugar Pie, which receivedthree of
the top hits on Googlefor“therapy cat,”
so you know she must be as famous as
her owner’s website says.

According to an article in Mental
Health Matters, animalbehaviorists say
thatcatsareequally, if notmore capable
of comforting the sick and elderly.

“Cats raised more like dogs and
breedsthathaveaneasygoingtempera—
ment, such as Maine coons, can make

West Palm Beach veterinarian, said in
the article.

Rock Plaza Central
(with The Weakerthans)
Rex Theatre

1602 E. Carson St.

Sept. 23

General admission: $14

Rock Plaza Central hangs out
with all of the outsiders.

That’s how front man Chris
Eaton tells it, anyway.

“It’s a real bonding of outsid-
ers,” he said. “People who may
not feel exactly part of the crowd
they’re surrounded by  some-
how come together through the
music and ﬁnd some kind of com-
munity.”

This sentiment captures the
spirit of the band’s music, from
its blend of sound to its actual
formation.

For Rock Plaza Central, music

bum represents a formless sort
of ﬂow of ideas, which becomes
a puzzle of complicatedpcreative
structures. A

Sounds become a cloud of in-
struments and harmonies, press-
ing yet appealing in their collec-
tive rightness.

The building ensemble sound
of the track “Oh I Can” ﬁts into
this idea. The song also proves
that one man cannot create on
his own.

“It was an old song about
something totally different,”
Eaton said.

“Then we started playing it,
and I said, ‘Oh, the way this is
going now, the words, everything,
has to change.”’

Eaton said he welcomes
change.

He never opposes a creative
suggestion or push in a new di-
rection.

Rock Plaza Central operates
on an “If it ﬁts, go with it” ap-
proach.

Eaton said the band was

time friends.

“It was one
of these amaz-
ing things where
people were com-
ing up afterwards
and going, ‘Wow,
that was so tight.
How long have
you guys been
together?’ And I
didn’t know the
names of several
of the people,” he
said.

Friendly con-
nections don’t af-
fect the way music
sounds, and ano-
nymity can be a great inﬂuence.

Rock Plaza Central keeps its
music ever—changing, especially
in live shows.

“A song can go from one night
being a really loud, rocking song
to then being really quietand
pretty,” Eaton said.

Creativity cannot be an exact
science, but Eaton describes his

in one direction and that’s ‘ki-
netic meaning,”’ he said. “I like

‘potential meaning.
Eaton’s approach to giving in-

terviews delightfully mirrors his

approach to creating music.

“I don’t ever go into these con-
versations having any sort of idea
of where they’re going to go,” he
said. .

Rock Plaza Central’s creative
perspective means that its music
will never get boring because it
will never be quite the same from
show to show.

The sound takes on the qual-

ity of a musical conversation.

N o benchmarks are set beyond a
good set and a good time.

Even though audience mem-
bers won’t know one another’s
names and wo n’t have heard these
songs in the past, they shouldn’t
worry —— neither has Rock Plaza

Central.
The songs are elusive and

‘ -complex but true to the outsid-

ers community. ,

Outsider communities be-
come possible with Rock Plaza
Central. .

Anyone with an obscure mu-
sical skill, a creative sense of
play and a dedication never to
get stuck in a rut will appreciate
this band.

With Eaton, art might be phys-
ics, but musical creativity falls far
from a science for the band.

No formula will make a piece
sound right all the time.

Something more organic
shapes the Rock Plaza Central
experience, like sowing a cre-
ative seed, unsure of what’s been
planted. . .

“[What] I like to go see is
something new, something be-
ing created at that moment,” he
said. “That’s, what we do.”

Could privatization save
NASA from budget black hole?

Costs of photographing Earth don’t have to be astronomical

Donald Campbell

You know that phrase “This isn't rocket:
science?” Well, this story isn’t. But it might
prove to change the face of the ﬁeld.

Two: MIT students challenged the re-
quired expense of scientiﬁc experiments,

imaging and travel in space.

A user post on iReport.com recently i
told ya‘ brief story of two students, Justin:
Lee and Oliver Yeh, who successfully put ‘
a craftvinto the upper atmosphere, allow- fr.‘
ing them to photograph the curvature of

the earth. _

How much do you think they spent?
You’re probably overestimating it. Lee and
Yeh spent just less than $150. A _

Space missions might be able to succeed
despite a lack of complexity, and they will
be more practical with a reduced price

Recent news published by The New
York Times suggests that NASA is in deep
trouble. P

A panel of expertsdeemed NASA’s cur-

. rent plans of scrapping the space shuttle
and developing the new Ares I launching

‘ system impractical and unsustainable. '

‘ The panel, whichjP»resident Obama cre-

L ated to present scenarios for future-Ameri-

can space exploration, found it difficult to
believe that NASA-could successﬁilly create
a system‘ by which humans could affordably
and sustainably explore space. S

‘It found that Ares 1, although a good
idea when it was initially approved, would
prove too costly to reach the ultimate goals
of the space agency in the future.

This leads to_the prediction that per-

haps NASA will begin looking to private '

industry to augment its development and
design capabilities.

. This project will probably remain a

But what does this mean for space ex-
ploration? It simply reinforces the old
dictum that less is more. .

It might also suggest that space ﬂight
shouldn’t always betas grand and com-
plicated as the s.toriedrApo1lo missions
of old.

Perhaps Lee and Yeh proved that NASA
might be better off attempting to keep its

projects simpler rather than inching to-

_ a fresh perspective
to the American space effort and -might
ﬁnd a solution to the current quandary
of space exploration that will be cheaper
and more elegant than any solution NASA
has produced.

It’s true that a camera strapped to a
balloon and the Ares I missions, designed

for-deep space exploration, cannot be con-

sidered fully equivalent.

But one can perhaps ﬁnd inspiration in
a 2o—mile sideways, 18-mile vertical ﬂight,
beginning in Massachusetts.

Lee and Yeh could attest to the fact that,
with a little spark of ingenuity, anything
is possible and that anything, even rocket

- science, can be inexpensive.

often miss out on the ﬁin, as Oakland locals
are often the ones meeting here for dancing
and a general good time. '

The food is not that fantastic, but it’s a
chance to get away from traditional college
bar food and student hangouts, making it a
great alternative for half-price.

Mi Ranchito is exactly what you pay
for. -

Chips and salsa were served even before
we ordered. But the chips weren’t that fresh
and needed salt. The salsa was watery and
lacked any ﬂavor or texture, which can make
or break salsa. -

I ordered the cheese enchiladas with
mole sauce ($7.95), which were rather
bland. _

A good mole should satisfy an endless
desire for chocolate but surprise the eater
with a Chuck Norris chili kick to the mouth.

Mole should be thick and rich, not thin like

Mi Ranchito’s. '

The guacamole was pretty good, but
there just wasn’t a lot of it. The Mexican
rice was cooked well and was ﬂavored with
corn and chili powder. The beans, obviously
cooked in lard, were scrumptious. '

Mi Ranchito also serves these side dishes

I with lengua, or cow tongue, which "is abso-

lutely delicious if cooked well.

My friend across the table ordered three
Mi Ranchito barbacoa tacos ($2.95 each).

The barbacoa, which is just barbecued
beef, was done well with picante peppers,
salt and black pepper. But there just wasn’t
a lot of ﬂavor with the tacos.

On the side was a spicier salsa, made
thick with chili powder. The salsa really gave
the meal its ﬂavor. The tacos were alright,
but nothing special.

As it’s almost impossible to get Mexi-
can food without imbibing some sort of
tequila, I settled on a strawberry margarita,
($5.00) hoping for a tropical drink with a
little umbrella served to me by beautiful
girls in grass skirts. I V

The drink looked good. It was served in
an actual margarita glass, unlike some other
places. But it had a weak ﬂavor.

Too much tequila can make a margarita

unenjoyable, but this one was underwhelm- .

ing. A good margarita should have the ﬂavor,
but not the harshness, of tequila. This one
could have been virgin, for all I know.

i Mi Ranchito . serves half-price food

Overall, this place is ‘perfect for the half-
price munchies or a sit—down burrito after
a long day in class or at work.

V But when you’re there, don’t expect
amazing Mexican food. Keep it simple with
burritos or easy chicken dishes. We’re just
too far north for mole.

Panthers pro ve ‘golden ’ at Tournament

Volleyball team takes Blue-Gold Tournament to break fwe.— game losing streak in time to begin conference play

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
got what it needed at this week-
end’s Blue-Gold Tournament at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

The Panthers were struggling.
They had played nine out of their
11 games on the road -— including
three tournaments — and were on
a ﬁve-game losing streak after un-
successful trips to State College and
Albuquerque, N.M. .

But the Panthers dominated this
weekend, winning the tournament
championship on their home court
and improving their record to 8-6
before heading into Big East play.

“It’s one thing if you play easy
competition, but we weren’t doing
that,” coach Toby Rens said. “We
played ﬁve teams that were ranked
in the top 20, RPI-wisejugglingthat
with school and travel can be chal-
lenging for any team — let alone a
team with four new starters — but I
think we’ve really grown through all
that and have really good prepara-
tion for the Big East games.”

The Panthers notched victories
over Valparaiso (3-1), Maryland-
Eastem Shore (3-0) and Youngstown
State (3-2).

After averaging4.92 digs per set,

notching four assists and serving
three aces, senior Michelle Rossi was
named tournament MVP.

“Michelle’s been one of the most
consistent players on the team,”
Rens said. “Her passing and de-
fense is consistently there, day in
and day out, in practice and games.
Her leadership and commitment is
really helping the team right now.”

Seniors Melissa Stadelman and
Meagan Dooley and junior Amy
Town joined Rossi on the all—tour-
nament team. .

Dooley recorded 22 kills against
Youngstown State in the ﬁnals, while
Town notched a double-double with
19 kills and 14 digs.

Stadelman just missed her own
double-double,‘ scoring 13 kills,
nine digs and two blocks. Sopho-
more Allyson Hodnik also notched
a double-double with a career-high
66 assists and 16 digs.

“We get spoiled because Meagan
shows up every single day. Her and
Melissa really lead the charge forthis
team,” Rens said. “Meagan’s been
on every all—tournament team we’ve
played in all season — and deserv-
edly so.”

Pitt picked up a big win against
Valparaiso in its first game Satur-
day. V

Rens said it was a signiﬁcant win,
as the Crusaders were picked to win

the Horizon League this year and
have outside hitter Angie Porche —
the reigning Horizon League player
of the year and a two -time AVCA all-

American honorable mention.

“We worked hard to prepare for
that match,” Rens said. “The play of
our middles in that match — Dooley

and Imani Harper— was exception-
al. That reallyopened up things for
our offense.”

In the ﬁnals, Pitt needed all ﬁve

Sports Editor

In his first collegiate start, Pitt
freshman Dan Mason was named
the Big East defensive player of
the week.

His 11 tackles and two sacks '

paced the Panthers (3-0) during
their 27-14 victory over Navy on
Saturday. Mason, a Pittsburgh
native from Penn Hills, is one of
four true freshmen listed on Pitt’s
two-deep roster. I
His teammates noticed his
strong effort. V
“He’s a young guy, but-he[didn’t

act like it,” defensive end Greg
Romeus said after the game.

In three games, Mason is third
on the team with 16 tackles and
two sacks. 3

As Pitt’s middle linebacker,
Mason anchored the defense
against Navy’s triple-option at-
tack ~ a type of running play in
which the quarterback can hand
off to the fullback, pitch to the
running back or keep the ball
before pitching it to the running
back. .

Mason took the starting job af-
ter a left ankle sprain held senior
Adam Gunn out of the game.

‘ Gunn was named conference

defensive player of the week last
week for his 11-tackle effort in
Buffalo on Sept. 12. The datie
of his return to the team is un-
known. -

Pitt’s defensive presence held
the Midshipmen (1-2), the na-
tion’s top rushing team for the
past four years, to 129 yards rush-_,
ing. Navy’s performance this year
was more than 100 yards below
its average.

The Panthers will take on NC
State (2-1) Saturday at 3:30 p.m.
They defeated the Wolfpack 34-19
in the 2001 Tangerine Bowl, btﬁ‘
this will be the team’s first trip to
Raleigh since 1988.

Huerbin proves he’ s
still a fan of Stull

Jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

Remember when Pitt fans booed Bill Stull?
And then booed him again? And one more
time —- you know, just to get the message
across?

A year later, Stull took heat from a
hostile hometown crowd in Pitt’s season
opener against Youngstown State on Sept.
5. His response? He threw for two touch-
downs on 123 yards and a passer rating of
162.08 in the Panthers’ 38-3 victory.

In the Buffalo game, Stull looked nearly

1 ﬂawless at times as he completed 21 of 30

 

If Stull continues to put up solid numbers  I’ll

feel conﬁdent that this year will be Pitt’s year to
play in a BCS bowl game. .

Well, it looks like the quarterback is
ﬁnally ﬁghting back. When fans booed him
last year, he shrugged it off and ‘kept quiet
as he led the Panthers to a 9-3 regular
season record and their first bowl game
since 2004.

attempts for 170 yards and three touch-
downs. He also rushed from three yards
out for a fourth score.

It wasn’t a statement game because
Stull didn’t need one. He just needed to
play his game and ﬁnd chemistry with

With Stull leading the pack, it could be a possibility

his teammates. His passes weren’t over-
thrown, wobbly or poorly executed. He
played with poise — on the road —— and
found success.

» Stull’s performances inpthe first two
games of the season were impressive
enough for Pitt .coach Dave Wannstedt
to reﬂect on the redshirt senior’s adver-
sity.

-- “Last week, the best thing that . could

have happened for Bill was to play on the 1

road,” Wannstedt said. “I think it was

‘ good for him mentally to get away and play

in front of a road crowd where he could
focus on just playing football. He went u
to Buffalo and had success.” '

Stull kept it going in Pitt’s win over
Navy Saturday. The Midshipmen (1-2)
nearly upset then-No. 6 Ohio State in the
first weekend of college football and were
coming off a 32-14 stomping of Louisiana
Tech.

But Navy’s recent strong play didn’t
affect Stull. He threw for 245 yards and
one touchdown by completing 17 of 24
attempts, including two passes to sopho-
more receiverjonathan Baldwin on crucial
fourth ‘down plays.

In three games this season, Stull has
completed 70 percent of his passes and
has thrown for six touchdowns and only
one interception.

Say what you want about Pitt’s oppo-
nents so far this season, but Buffalo is
the defending Mid-Atlantic Conference
champion, and Navy’s defense has aver-
aged six sacks per game and is a threat to
take down a team any week.

And when freshman running back Dion
Lewis was only able to put up a solid 81
yards. -— not nearly as impressive as his
previous effort —- Stull was steady.

Stull’s only mistake — a fumble at

Navy’s 4-yard line after catching his own _ —

deflected pass and running for 20 yards
— came early in the game.

' As the Panthers’ offensive playcaller,
Stull expects big things from his team this
year. For him, there is only one team that
can take down Pitt.

“The only thing that can stop us is our-
selves,” he said after the Navy game.

Some quarterbacks can play superb
football right out of high school, while
others need a few years. Wannstedt has

1 stuck with Stull for this long and now the

quaterback is shining under in his ﬁfth

If Stull continues to put up solid num-
bers as the Panthers head into Big East
play in a couple weeks, I’ll feel conﬁdent

that this year will be Pitt’s year to play in

' And as much as some will be surprised

sets to beat Sloungstown State. The Panthers
were down 1-2 heading into the fourth set after
the Penguins took two highly-contested sets
27-25 and 25-20.

The fourth set was also a tight match until
the Pantherswent on a 7-0 run to open up a
21-14 lead.

From there, Pitt ended the set but not after
the Penguins got within three points.

Pitt jumped to an early 5-1 lead in the ﬁﬁzh

Panthers pounce the Penguins

The Panthers take their three—game wilf-
ning streak into their ﬁrst Big East matchups
of the season.

They host two of the better teams in the
Big East — Marquette (10-4) on Saturday and

' Syracuse (9-4) on Sunday — with the hopes
r of improving last year’s 8-6 in-conference

record.

“Marquette is a much-improved team from
last year,” Rens said. “It’s deﬁnitely going to be
abattle against them, and the same with Syra-
cuse. They’ll make you earn your points.”
