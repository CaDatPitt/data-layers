This past Saturday, Pitt students who
weren’t atthe Homecominggame could
most likely be found at the MTV “Real
World” castingcall in Pitl3burgh’s South
Side. ‘

From 10 am. to 5 p.m. on East Car-
son Street, numerous hopefuls could
be spotted standing outside ﬁlling out
“Real World” applications against the
windows ofTown Tavern bar. ,

As of 3:03 p.m., casting director
Kasha Foster had interviewed ap-
proximately 150 people with 30 more
lined up for the next hour. “I’ve seen
people from all over,”.she said. Local
residents and smdentsfrom Pitt, Point

Fireworks shoot off of the Cathedral of Learning Friday night as part

of Homecoming celebrations.

Pitt students audition for

ParkandDuquesne cameto thecasting

call, along with non—native individu— ‘

als ﬁ'om Akron, Ohio, and even West
Virginia. .

As a casting director for the past i

eight years, Foster has worked on six
seasons of “Real World.” This casting
call was her ﬁrst time in Pittsburgh,

_ which, despite getting lost often, she

described as an inviting experience
overall. ' ’

“I love the look of the city and the
vibe of the people,” she said. “It feels

East Coast, but it’s Southern atthe same

time.” ‘

As for her experience with appli-
cants from Pitt, she noticed arecurring
theme of “Pitt party pride.” , '

“They went out of their way to tell
me Pitt was a party school,” Foster

‘Real World’

said. .

Casting-call protocol had about
a dozen or so applicants talking to
Foster and co—casting directorjessica
Thompson.

“We doaroundtable discussionand
tiytoﬁnd outwhatpeoplearepassion-
ate about,” Foster explained. “Young
peoplearetryingto getjobs, sowe may
discuss the economy.”

Before candidates got the chance
to talk to Foster and Thompson, they
ﬁrst had to ﬁll out a questionnaire-
style application, attach a picture and
wait. The lucky ones get a phone’ call
withinaweek. They are then that much
closertobecominga“RealWorl ”cast

Mayoral

candidates meet

sans Ravenstahl

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

Therewas amayoral debate last night,
but the mayor wasn’t there.

The two Independent candidates
for Pittsburgh’s mayor, Franco Dok
Harris andKevinAcklin, spoketo about
a dozen Pitt students at the Student
Government Board—sponsored event
in David Lawrence Hall last night.

“Where’s Luke?” Acklin asked, re-
ferringto Mayor Luke Ravenstahl. The
mayor, who is both the Democratic and
Republican parties‘ candidate, canceled
Sunday morning, SGB government re-
lations chairNick Trainer said.

Harris and Acklin both spoke for
halfan hour about the city’s budget
crisis and otherissues andthen opened
up to questions.

Harris proposed using “found
money” through dialogue with state

- legislators from new taxes on table

games, ratherthan taxing college stu-
dents.

Acklin, who spoke second, said
that he didn’t understand Ravenstahl’s
proposal to taxstudents’ tuition, when
the city needs to do everything that it
canto keep youngpeople here. He said
that Ravenstahl did it because there
was no way for students to hold him
accountable.

“He doesn’t believe you guys have
political power,” Acklin said.

Both candidates encouraged stu-
dents to go out and vote, saying that
this election is very important to their
future as students.

Harris said that the long-term so-
lution to the city’s budget problems
would be to increase Pittsburgh’s popu-
lation by luring college graduates with
“transition jobs,”or entry-level jobs in

Police testify that crowd became ‘belligerent’  

Court 4 4 _ F

“Ijustwantto say thatthis is in no
wayanadmission of guilt,” Martin said.
“It is solely so this  arrest doesn’t use
any more of my time or interfere with
my attempts to be a teacher.”

 

Martin was one of 72 people who
appeared in court Friday. The 36 who
took the community service will ap-
pearincourtjanuary alongside others
who took the same deal during their
Wednesday hearings, to prove they’ve
done their service and possibly have
their charges withdrawn. ‘

For most of the others, Friday
consisted of shifting through hours
of often conﬁising testimony.

When police and students conflict

Pitt st1rdentAdamDulakand police
officers presented different accounts
of Dulak’s arrest Thursday, Sept. 24,
the night before the G—20 Summit.

City police Lt. Ed Trapp provided
an overview of the night, saying about
800 to 1,000 people had gathered in
Oakland.

The crowd became “belliger-
ent” and ofﬁcers used a Long Range
Acoustic Device, a machine capable
ofbroadcasﬁngmessages arninimum
of a quarter mile away at its lowest set-
ting, to tell people in Schenley Plaza
they needed to disperse, 'I‘rapp said.

Initially, the crowd only had to dis-
perse from Schenley Plaza, he said. But
as the crowd moved, the area from
which they were ordered to disperse
changed.

Trapp said the order to disperse

did not apply to people who were in
buildings, including businesses and
dormitories.

Detective Dave Honick testiﬁed
that he had been working a 16- to 18-

hour shift for the S.W.A.T. team the ’

night Dulak was arrested.
He said he saw Dulak, whom he
ﬁrst referred to as “Mr. Dulsky,” in a

group of 20 to 25 people on Oakland . ,.
Avenue. He said the group impeded . ' '

the ﬂow of traflic. _
Honick said he yelled at the crowd
to move away from ofﬁcers, but the

crowd approached oﬁicers, anyway. . ..

He said oﬂicers deployed smoke into
the crowd, “tryingto give them awam-
ing not to come down this way.”

He said ofﬁcers then_deployed a
canister of OC gas, or pepper spray,
into the crowd.

“Mr. Dulak marched through the
smoke toward me,” Honick said,
which caused him to deploy the gas
between him and Dulak. “I-Ie fell to
the ground, and I picked him up and
moved him out of the way.”

Honick said he thoughtDulak, 22,
was intoxicated. .

Oﬂicers arrested Dulak shortly af-
ter midnight for failure to disperse.

Dulak’s friend, Pitt student Michael
McDermott, 22, testiﬁed in court Fri-
day morning.

He said Dulakmethimathisapart-
ment around 8:30 p.m. Sept. 24 and
that the two stayed there until they
decided to go to Peter’s Pub.

They arrived at the Oakland Av-
enue bar between 11 and 11:15 p.m.,
he said. Dulak had two drinks before
the pair decided to leave so Dulak could
meet his girlfriend.

Both McDermott‘and Dulak said
they didn’t hear any warnings to dis-
perse while they headed into the bar
and that they didn’t hear any warnings

A judge questions a student at Friday’s hearing.

when they were in the bar.
“It was very loud in there,” Dulak
said.

But when he stepped outside, he '

quickly encountered a cloud of gas.
“I inhaled it, started coughing,

spun around and went to one knee

against the building. I saw something

coming at me and got sprayed,” he .

said, referring to the riot control gas.

Dulak said he was on the sidewalk
when police arrested him and that of-
ﬁcers moved him into the street.

Noting the differences between
the two accounts, Assistant District
Attorney Geoffrey Melada asked Dulak
during cross-examination, “So when
the ofﬁcer testiﬁed before  that was
a complete lie?”

“Yes,” Dulak said.

Orders to disperse confuse

Trapp said thatwhen he arrived inthe Plaza,
“There were peopleinthe crowd thatwere throw-
ingthings. I could see something going through
the air — bottles.”

He said police gave the order to disperse at
10:42 p.m., when the crowd became “more and
more belligerent toward police.”

Attorneyjon Pushinsky asked Trapp what he
meant by “belligerent.” ’

“Coming up to the police, screaming, yelling,
that sort of thing,” Trapp said.

“Is there anything illegal about screaming at

the police?” Pushinsky asked.

“N0.”

‘ Pushinsky said one of the critical elements
of a disorderly conduct charge is that three or
more people acted disorderly. He asked Trapp if
he would give the names of speciﬁc people who
acted disorderly. V

“I speciﬁcally can’t point anybody out as act-
ing disorderly,” Trapp said.

He said ofﬁcers had left: the northeast corner
of the Plaza, near the Forbes Avenue and Schenley
Drive Extension intersection, accessible.

“We didn’t want  to close the ,gap,” he
said.

Pushinskyasked Trapp if itwould be reason-

ableforpeopletothinkthey’ddispersedifthey’d v

leftthe plaza. A ,
Assistant DistrictAttorney Courtney Butter-
ﬁeld objected to Pushinsky’s question, saying it
was speculationto ask what people would think
is reasonable. ' V ’
Trapp latertestiﬁed that officers received the

l orderto arrest at 11:07 p.m. He said he wasn’t sure

what time the order to arrest people speciﬁcally
on the Cathedral lawn was given.

He said oﬂicers arrested people on the Cathe-
dral lawn because Pitt police chief '1‘im Delaney
told him the campus police didn’t want anyone
on University property Thursday night.

“My understanding was that it would be
the same Friday night,” 'I‘rapp said, later add-
ing that he hadn’t spoken with Delaney, about
Friday night. .

When contacted by The Pitt News, Delaney
declined to respond to Trapp’s testimony. ‘

“I am moving forward. Respectfully, I don’t
have a comment,” he said. V

Attorney Cindy Cooke asked Trapp if Pitt
students were told to leave Pitt property

“All we told them was to leave the Plaza,”
'I‘rapp said.

“Did you tell them which direction to go to
get home?” the she asked.

By the time police began to arrest people on
the Cathedral lawn, ofﬁcers had surrounded
most of the Plaza and lined up across Forbes

Avenue near the Belleﬁeld Avenue intersection. ' -
Some police had also traveled down Belleﬁeld

Avenue. .
Several students later testiﬁed that they

thought moving across the Cathedral lawn was .

the best, if not the only, way to disperse.

One woman said ofﬁcers told her to jump the
hedges and move onto the Cathedral lawn, where
shewas eventually arrested. ‘

In response _to the lawyers’ question, Trapp
said he “ﬁgured they were college students. They
could ﬁgure it out on their own.”

Both said theywant to move back toward com-
munity-oriented policing, where policewalktheir
beats and build relationships with the community
to help prevent crime rather than react to it.

Acklin said he would promote development
thatwould beneﬁt neighborhoods. He discussed
money sources, suchas arena revenue, thatcould —
help run community centers and pools for the
neighborhoods that host them.

The candidates made few references to each
other’s policies, but made several critiques of the
Ravenstahl administration.

Harris called for more transparency in city
government and government motivated “by vi-
sion, not politics.” '

Acklin agreed with Harris and said that Ra-
venstahl listens to corporate interests more than
the community.

Some students were disappointed by the low
uimout and the mayor’s absence.

The ’Burgh’s new nicknames

itisburgh just isn’t content to

settle with “the ’Burgh” for its

nickname. Pittsburgh likes its
monikers st1'aight—to —tl1e-point.

We have aplethora ofbridges. Thus,
“City of Bridges.” The familiar skyline
image showcasing the Point appears
on every Pittsburgh postcard.Thisview
also shows the connection of the three
rivers. Hence, the nickname “Three
Rivers.” So Pittsburgh has a pretty ex-
tensive list of nicknames, but we’d like
toaddafewmoretothe mix.

Cityofnot-‘Philadelphia

It’s a de facto Pittsburgher para-
digm: Pittsburghers don’t like Phila-
delphia.

Call it an entrenched inferiority
complex. Pittsburgh loves to berate its
big brother, and Pittsburgh’s unﬂag—
ging affection for its sports teams is
paralleled only by its  for those
of Philadelphia. But all this contempt

feelsabitliketheantiquatedcontempt ,

ofthe CivilWarerainwhichPhillyisthe
North and Pittsburgh is the South. To
the North, the CivilWarisancienthisto-
ry. But inthe South, subtle resentment
lingers. It’s true that you can still ﬁnd
a Philly fanatic with a steadfast scorn
for the ’Burgh. But on the whole, it’s
a one-sided ﬁght. Maybe it’s the City
of Brotherly Love living up to its nick-
name, but Pittsburgl'1ﬁansinPhilly seem
more accepted.

The intrastate location seems the
only real common ground. When it
comes to population, acornerstone
of comparison between cities, Phila-

delphia obviously trumps’Pit1sburgh. '

Philadelphia’s population in2006 was
an estimated 1,448,394, while Pitts-
burglfs estimatedat312,819, according
to the U.S. Census Bureau.

City of Champions - for now

No, this self-congratulatory nick-
name didn’t originate after this past
year’s Super Bowl and Stanley Cup
sweep. It was used largely when the

, Panthers, Steelers and Pirates eachwon
championships in the 1970s. Now, the
title has made a resurfacing. Save the
abysmal shipwreck the Pirates have
become, the Penguins, Steelers and
Panthers are still on their game. So
soak up the glory now. Your die—hard
black-and-goldjerseybearerwont be-
lieve it, but teams can’t reign forever.
There’s a reason for salary caps and
draitlotteries.

Greener City

Pittsburgh was chosen to host the
G-20 SLunmitbecau_seit’sanemblem of

Forbes magazinerankedPit1sburghthe

look greener, considering that in the
steel production days of the 20th cen-

Lewis Lehe Endorses Things
Cultural identity separate from race

Lewis Lehe
Columnist

   

In 2004, Alan Keyes was running
against an upstart lawyer named
Barack Obama in a U.S. Senate
race. Down for the count, swing-
ing wildly, Keyes made the following
accusation:

“Barack Obama claims an Afri-
can—American heritage  Barack
Obama and I have the same race
—— that is, physical characteristics.
We are not from the same heritage
 My ancestors toiled in slavery in

 

this country.”

Obama not an African—Ameri-
can? It is hard to argue that you are
an African—American only if your

great-great-great-great grandfa-
ther was born in Africa, but not
if your dad was. Are you only an
Irish-American if your ancestors
ﬂed the potato famine? The denial
rings especially false from Keyes’
lips: He believes Obama was born
in Kenya.

Keyes is clearly fumbling for a
word, though. His quip illustrates
the need for a word that means
more than “an American of Afri-
can descent” —— something like
what W.E.B. Du Bois had in mind
when he titled his book “The Souls
of Black Folk.” Fortunately, we do

‘African—American’ too ambiguous

Lehe 4 7

have such a word. The word is “Black.” As in
“Black people.”

Today I endorse saying “Black” sometimes,
instead of saying “African—American” in every
case. Here is what I mean by Black:

First of all, Black is a-capitalized word.
Black people are not black.

What makes Black people Black is that they
participate in Black culture — the culture
that has evolved from the culture of West
Africans who were brought over to the New

J World as slaves.

Black people aren’t just Americans, if by
“American” we mean “United States of Amer-
ica.” Black people live all over the Western
hemisphere. A

g;___

‘I3lack’ preserves conformity across
languages and places.

- Here are afew reasons to embrace “Black”
over “African—American:”

First, it takes a long time to say “African-
American.” The phrase has seven syllables ——
one more than just outright saying “of African
descent.” It’s rare that a noun elongates its
own deﬁnition.

Second, because of how awkward it is to
say, “African—American” has become a phrase
White people use when they are afraid of of~
fending Black people. It says, “Look how much
effort I’m spending to show I respect you.”
But respect is something better revealed in
actions, not word choice. Black and White
friends nearly always say “Black.”

Third, replacing “Black” with “African-
American” implies that all people of African
descent participate in Black culture, and
thereby cut-and—pastes an identity onto Af-
rican immigrants. These people are African-
Americans, but might not want to be Black.

Fourth, if we use “African—American” to
denote exclusively whatl call “Black,” as Alan

ts-

Keyes does, then what will we call recent ar-

- rivals from Africa? We would have to call them

“African—African Americans,” or “American-
Africans” or something else stupid that no
one will ever actually say.

Fifth, “Black” preserves conformity across
languages and places. “Negro” is the word
used in_Latin American Spanish and Brazilian
Portuguese. it translates directly as “Black.”
These are two of the three languages that
Black people speak in numbers, so they should
inﬂuence the English usage. In the United
States, we have gotten away with confusing

“African—American” and “Black” only because .

the United States happens to not share bor-
ders with countries that have many Black
people —- all the Black people wemeet are
also African—Americans. But elsewhere, Black
cultures span national borders. Should we
expect Colombians to call a woman Afro-
Colombiana when she is in Colombia and
then Afro—Venezuelana when she crosses the
borderjlo miles to visit her sister in Venezuela
on the weekend?

Finally, cutting “Black” fromthe language
leaves an asymmetry, since no one actually
says “Caucasian—Americans.” I could never
explain to my child that he is White — at

' least half — but that his friends are African-

Americans. And if you can’t explain such a
common word to a child, to hell with it.
Now for the question you’ve been waiting

. to take offense at. Is Obama a Black man?

I say that Obama is, today, a Black man.
He has become Black by moving to Chicago’s
South Side, marrying a Black woman, join-
ing a Black church and immersing himself
in Black culture. So, he participates in Black
culture. But he grew up in Indonesia and Ha-
waii, outside of Black culture. So, I would say
that, before he was in his 205, no, Obama
was not Black.

However, there is-plenty of room for.am+
biguity. Who’s to say for sure a man is African-

American, African, American, Caribbean, ‘

Latino or Black? Words are just useﬁil tools

I we have. And language, therefore, is never

African—American or White.

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

I would like to express my objection to
Samantha Stah1’s Oct. 21 column, “Calling all
hipsters! Date needed.” In the column; Stahl
encourages her imaginary hipster dateto talk
ab out “the latest group of whining whiteJew-
ish 20—somethings marketing themséﬂves as
the world’s next electro sensations.”i'7§;l'1e use

' of the word “Jewish” to describe a ﬁctional

band is extraneous and distasteful, particu-
larly when this Jewish band is juxtaposed

with a group of people the author mocks. A
I am sure that there are many electro

‘bands withoutJewish members. Why make

this distinction in the article? It is wrong to
associate Jews with hipsters.
Jews have been unfairly associated with

‘ groups disliked in American society in the
I past, such as the comttflunists. There is no
. need to add hipsters to the list.

Though FACI‘ stays true to its met-

sounds catchier and more cohesive.
“Recorded music is great because

you can actuallyfocus on the music and
listen to the very small details that you

i may not hear in a live performance,”

drummer Eij i Matsumoto said in an e-
mail, with the help of translator Taeko

“We wanted to ﬁgure out what is
the best way to engage the interest of

something visual as an image, we be-

regardless of genre.”

The band said it’s a greatwayto stay

simultaneously focus on the music.

The One More Brick Tour is FAC1"s

Senses Fail is no stranger to the

world of rock ’n’ roll and claimed some
well-known modern bands, including
Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day and
Thursday, as inﬂuences.

B Because it’s on an independent

label, it retains control over the musi- —

had songs featured on numerous movie
soundtracks, including “Underworld:

Senses Fail’s music evolves with each

the songwriting.

“The guitar player comes up with .

and song melodies are added later,-

Nielsen said.

Real World 4 1

Victor Powell I Contributing Editor
“Real World” hopefuls let their personalities run wild in a
preliminary group casting session.

he opportunity to be a part ofthis
show came on a whim. 1

“My buddies found out “Real
World” was casting [nearby] and
told me to go try out I’d never really
watched the show before. I thought it
was stupid,” Bruzgo said.

But Bruzgo had the weird name
and the crazy personality— inshort,
he was perfect.

Like Bruzgo, Pitt student Brittany
Lynch didn’t come to the casting call
with direct intent to become a cast
member.

“I came to provide moral support
for my best friend, Maggie Barton,”
Lynch said. She didn’t have much to
say about herself when asked to list
qualiﬁcations that made her an ideal
candidate. Instead, she gave a long
list of reasons why Barton would be

' perfect for the show.

“There’s never a dull moment with
[Maggie]. She is literally the most awe-
some person I’ve ever met,” Lynch
said. “I get excited to be around her.
I get excited to see her, and she’s the

toughest girl I know.”

Candidates like Barton, with origi-
nal and genuine stories to tell, are what
castingdirectorsarelookingforinnew
cast members. a

“We’re not looking for prototypes
or stereotypes of cast members we’ve
had before,” “RealWorld” supervising
castingdirectorﬁainon Furbergsaid.
“We’re looking for people we’ve never
met before and stories we’ve never told
before.”

“We’re looking for any person
who is genuinely passionate about
an ' g,” Foster said.

Be it pride in partying at Pitt, reli-
gion or triumph over adversity, noth-
ing is excluded.

“We’re trying to give viewers an
opportunity to be introduced to things
they may not know about,” she said.

The opportunity to become a
“Real World” cast member might
mean missing a semesters worth of
school. Last season, Bruzgo leaped
at the opportunity regardless of the
consequences.

or chance to become a ‘Real’ roommate

“I ﬁgured, what else was Igoingto
do? It was such a cool and unique op-
portunity that one in a couple billion
people get to do,” he said.

“I spent my entire life inschool,” he
added, admitting that itwas intimidat-
ing to veer away ﬁom the familiarity
of college life.

“All of a sudden I’m out of school,
and it it’s alittle scary to throw yourself

off the beaten track,” he said. Having».

had the experience, Bruzgo admits that
he made the right decision.
Furbergcalls“RealWorld”achance
for people within the 18-24 age range
to grow up. The show, unlike other

reality TV contests, presents sup-pr

port from peers who might be going‘
through the same changes.

The difference between “Real
World” and time at a college or uni-
versity, according to Furberg, is this:
“When allis said and done, they get to
have a document of their experiencesr
afterward. They get to see themselves
in a different perspective than they
would in everyday life.”

Tybout: Industry inside joke is areal scream

Though you might not have realized it, you have probably heard the scream heard around the celluloid world

Andy Tybout
Columnist

From now through Oct. 31, channels like
AMC and ABC Family will be hosting a tire-

uless celebration of scary movies, from the

legendary to the terrible. For viewers, this
means a lot of fake blood, a lot of creative
deaths and a lot of screams.

In fact, there’s one scream in particular
— one recording — that will probably be
used in excess. It’s a legend in its own right
—- a staple of any movie of peril. You’ve
almost certainly heard it before —— perhaps

in “Tropic Thunder” or maybe in “The Day '

the Earth Stood Still” remake. It’s called the

Wilhelm Scream, and it’s one of the biggest

inside jokes in the ﬁlm industry.

+ Like all great American legends, the Wil-

helm Scream came from humble beginnings
speciﬁcally, an otherwise forgotten 1951
ﬁlm called “Distant Drums.” The plot goes
like this: Professional badass Quincy Wyatt
(Gary Cooper) leads a small group of soldiers
into the Everglades to quell some Seminole
Indians, and, to make a long story short, a
character gets dragged underwater. by an
alligator. And he screams like a girl.

You ﬁlm fanatics know what I’m talk-
ing about: that convincing, if effeminate,

I7>uy - sell -

yelp.

But the scream —- recorded after the
ﬁlming by an unknown voice, actor — didn’t
catch on overnight. In fact, it didn’t even

less largely forgotten Warner Bros. ﬁlms,
echoing through the silver screen like the
ghost of all those dead extras. Then came
“Star Wars.” If you own it, jump to the scene

have a name until 1953, when it was used
again in “The Charge at Feather River.” The
movie’s plot is almost disturbingly similar
to “Distant Drums” — a couple of gung-ho
soldiers charge into American Indian terri-
tory to rescue some damsels. Unfortunately,
they pay a terrible price — the life of Private
Wilhelm (Ralph Brooks), who is cut down
by an arrow to the leg. The pre—recorded
yelp he lets out is a disgrace to all movie
cowboys. ' -

After that, the scream appeared in count-

where Luke Skywalkeris on theledgieiof some I

endless pit shootingjdown storm'jjtroop—
ers on the_ other side. See if you can hear
it now — that one luckless trooperfcrying
out in both pain and girlish desperation as

1 he tumbles into the abyss.

After that, Wilhelm became a fad.

I’m guessing many “Star Wars” fanatics
are quite familiar. with it — it’s in every
movie in the series, including the new ones.
And fans of “IndianaJones” should also feel
some sort of affinity. Remember that scene

in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” where a Nazi is
hurled off the back of a truck? Or the ﬁnal
scene in “The Temple of Doom” where a
certain character gets eaten by, interestingly
enough, an alligator? It’s all Wilhelm.

The scream owes its popularity mainly
to “Star Wars” and “Indian Jones” sound
designer Ben Burtt, who discovered the
original sound clip while doing research,
and he decided to make it a subtle signa-
ture of his —— a proverbial grafﬁti—mark on
the otherwise personality-less lan'dscape
of sound editing. .

Burtt has since retired the ‘scream, but
the movies haven’t. The shrilly scream

 -penetrates.nevsi..ﬁlms. .(.like..last—.vyear’s “In—

So the next time you’re at the movies
—— maybe during “Toy Story in 3-D,” when
Buzz Lightyear gets knocked out a window
by a lamp —— you can nudge the date/friend/
complete stranger sitting next to you and
inform them they just heard a cinematic
Easter egg. As long as someone knows the
secret, Private Wilhelm didn’t die in vain.

' Senses Fail hopes its audiences’ sense of hearing won’t fail at its upcoming show.

Once he records a song, he said, it’s no lon-
ger his song. It means something to his fans, and
while performingon stage, Senses Fail focuses on
presenting a good show.

Because theband has played and written to-
gether for so long, performing live unfolds like a
dance, and each member can anticipate the next
move of his fellow band member, Nielsen said.

A Senses Fail show might be a dance, but
Nielsen said FACT is pretty aggressive on stage
and that it’s impossible notto watchthe theatrical
Japanese band command its instruments with such
precision and explosive energy. '

But will FAC1"s ﬁrst experience playing for
mostly American audiences slow it down? Mat-
sumoto thinks not.

“Panthers earn’

ninth shutout
of season

For The Pitt News

Senior Meagan Dooley led the
women’s volleyball team to victo-
ry in the volleyball version of the
Backyard Brawl with 11 kills and
ﬁve blocks in the match against
West Virginia University.

Junior Amy Town also contrib-
uted with 10 kills from the outside

The Panthers, now 15-8 overall

and 7-2 in the Big East, earned
a victory over WVU (13-11, 3-6)
for their ninth shutout of the
season.

While earning the conference
victory, Pitt raised more than
$400 for the Susan G. Komen
Foundation in its ﬁrst Blocking
Out Breast Cancer match.

In the spirit of National Breast
Cancer Awareness Month, colle-
giate women’s volleyball organiza-
tions have joined the foundation
in ﬁghting the disease.

Before the match, foundation
representative Linda DeVos said
she was excited for the event and
the attention that it would bring
to breast cancer.

“I purposely brought informa-
tion and resources that would es-
pecially beneﬁt young women,”
DeVos said. “In educating the

*young people, we hope to accel— ‘

erate the discovery of a cure for
the disease.”

The Panthers responded to the
crowd of more than 300 people,
dressed in pink for the occasion
as they defeated their Big East

- prival.

Head coach Toby Rens said he
was pleased with the overall bal-
ance of play and the contributions
of certain role players.

“We had Melanie Feldman step
up with her passing in the back

' lgrow, and Rachel Kalberer was a

factor at the net with four kills in
the ﬁnal set,” he said.

The rotation adjustments
made by Rens are dictated by the

cer has had in our history,” head coach
Sue—Moy Chin said.“Right now, though,
we are disappointed knowing that the

season is over for us.”

Tara Ricciardi scored the winning
goalinthe 13th minute off an assistﬁom
Caitlin Hostetler andjill Cambum.

Chin said the gamewas disappoint-
ing because the Panthers started slow

"when they needed the game to stay in

toumament contention.

The Panthers had several opportu-
nities to score, with 16 shots — nine of
them on goal — during the game.

Although Providence out—shot Pitt
11-5 in the ﬁrst period, the Panthers
attempted 11 shots after the break to
the Friars’ 10. ‘

“It was a tale of two halves,” Chin
said. “We played extremely well in the
secondhalf, butwe weren’t able to ﬁnd
the equalizer.”

The Friars out-shot the Panthers
21-16 for the game, but Pitt held a 7-3
comer kick advantage.

Liz Carroll and Kat Weiler led the
Panther attack.

Carroll attempted four shots, with

three on goal. Weiler turned defense

into offense with three shots on the
day. .

Pitt -goalkeeper Morie Kephart
had seven saves, while Providence’s
Jill Schott stopped nineshots.

Pitt: 1
Connecticut: 0

In its eighth overtime game of the
season, Pitt defeated Connecticut to
end its weekend and regular season on
ahigh note. '

“It’s alittle bittersweettoday,” Chin
said. “We are happy aboutthewin and
what we accomplished, but we look
back and see [that] if we would have
won on Friday, wewouldbeinthe tour-
namen ” »

In the 93rd minute, senior Katie
Caslin booted the winning goal to the
upper left comer ofthe net oﬁ'aCarroll
assist. Carroll attempted ﬁve shots of
her own in the game.

The goal marked Caslin’sﬁ1stofthe
season, and Chin said it was a way for

the seniors to end their careers on a
positive feeling. ‘ b

“We didn’t have the toumament to
play for coming into this game, but we
wanted to tryto achieve goals and work

' toward theﬁitureofthe program,” Chin
said. “That was the ﬁrst time we beat ‘

Connecticut in our history.”

Kephart collected 12 saves, includ-
ing seven in the ﬁrst half. Connecticut
goalkeeperjessica Dulski stopped ﬁve
Panther shot attempts. ' .

_Pitt led the Huskies in comer kicks
6-2. The teams were  even in
shot attempts, withthe Huskies holding
a slight 22-21 advantage.

“We had a lot of things we were
lookingfor, andIwasn’t sure how they
would respond, but they respond ,”
Chin said. “'I‘heyplayed tremendous in
regulation and in the overtime.”

Chin said that despite not making
the Big East tournament, the team
broke the record for shutouts (10)
and tied the record forwins (eight) in
aseason. ‘

Men ’s isoccer remains  
winless in the Big East

Diana Connor I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Senior midﬁelder Mike McDade and the Panthers have struggled this season, especially
in the Big East. Pitt is 1-12-2 overall and still winless in the conference.

Ben Duignan
Staﬁ” Writer

A lone goal in the 48th minute by Notre Dame
was all the Irish needed, beating Pitt men’s soc-
cer 1-0 on Saturday afternoon. .

Kickoff was moved from 1 p.m. at Founders

* Field to 4 pm. at North Allegheny High School

because of inclement weather and poorﬁeld
conditions.
‘ Notre Dame midﬁelder Michael Rose scored

. the goal for the Irish, the ﬁrst goal of the sopho-
' more’s career. Senior midﬁelder Michael Thom-

as and junior forward Jeb Brovsky registered
assists on the tally.

Rosescoredwhen he knocked inacross from
Thomas, who leads the Irish with ﬁve assists
on the season. I A

The Panthers were out-shot 16-8, managing A

to get only one shot on goal, while the Irish put

six shots on the net.

Junior goalie Zack Matthews recorded ﬁve
saves for the Panthers, while his counterpart
in net, Phillip 'I‘uttle, stopped Pitt’s lone shot
on goal.

The Panthers, now the only winless team in
Big East play, dropped their record to 1-12-2 and
0-8-1 inthe conference. Pitt is now winless in
its last 14 contests since beating Robert Morris

on Sept. 1.

Notre Dame moved to‘9—6—1 on the season,
including an impressive 7-3 record in the ex-

tremely competitive Big East conference, and i

a 5-1 mark on the road. '.

The Irish are now tied for second place inthe
Big East Blue division with Georgetown, trailing
powerhouse Connecticut by one point.

Pitt will look to snap its losing streak when
it returns to action on Wednesday against Seton
Hall at Founders Field. The game is set for 7
p.m. -

“We use practice as an evaluation time,
and rewards are given out in the form of
playing time on game day,” Rens said.

In the second set, the Panthers found
themselves in a 20-20 tie after giving up
seven consecutive points to the Mountain-
eers. '

But three timely kills by Melissa Stadel-
man, Imani Harper and Kalberer secured
the Panther victory.

Rens said he believes the poise shown in
this set comes from a young team gaining
experience. A

“We have four new starters out there

this year,” he said. “Our difﬁcult schedule

this year has allowed us to develop our
consistency so that we can bounce back
after adverse situations.”

Pitt heads to St. John’s (8-16, 1-7) in a
Big East match Friday.

The future of the NFL

Greg Trietley
Staff Writer

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell recently an-
nounced his desire to play more regular season
games in London. New England Patriots owner
RobertKrafrthinks the city could supportafran—
chise within 10 years.

A decade from now, the NFL might look very
different. _

EA Sports releases Madden NFL ’20 on the
Xbox 1080, a game revolutionary for its “su—
per truck stick” button. The computer player
still doesn’t understand what zone defense is,
though. ‘

Owners and playersstillfeel the impact ofboth
the 2011 lockout, which the owners won, and the
2017 stﬁke, which the players won. All contracts
now include the infamous “I can’tbelieve the own-
ers conceded this to us” clause’, which allows every
player to demand a trade to the Giants halfway
through his college sophomore season. '

Thesalarycapislongforgotten, leftfordead at
the 2011 bargainingtab1e.Asaresult, afewteams
struggle to earn revenue in their markets.

The Buffalo Billsvhave relocated to Toronto
and have become the Toronto Bills, which fans
note makes little sense but still more sense than
the franchise keeping the Buffalo logo.

The St. Louis Rams, which Rush Limbaugh
brieﬂy owned in2014, moved to Mexico City and
became the Cameros. * a

Los Angeles ﬁnally ﬁnds a team when a local
politician notices that the part of the map that
had “avert your eyes!” written on it was actually
the Oakland Raiders. Al Davis, long unhappy in
Oakland, gladly packs up his windbreakers and
moves the team to Hollywood.

With all the franchise relocation, Goodellwill
calm every fan’s fear that his team is next, boldly
claiming that every franchise is deeply rooted
in its current home, and there will be no ll.l1‘tl‘l€I‘
relocaﬁon.

Hours later, the Baltimore Ravens pack up
under the cover of darkness in Mayﬂower mov-
ing vans and move to London. Just as Baltimore
named its team ‘after an Edgar Allan Poe poem,
London names its team the Rowlings and casts
Daniel Radcliffe—— not Harry Potter, justthe actor
who played him — as its mascot.

for a full division overseas. He calls it “European
NFL,” or, as the press dubbed it, “NFL Europe.”

Strappedfor cash afcerthe 2017 strike, Goodell
optsto reuse old Rhein Fire and Frankfurt Galaxy
jerseys. For ease, the league just places ﬁanchises
in Rhein and Frankﬁrrt and pretends that the old
NFL Europe never folded in the ﬁrst place. Most
fans buy it. _

A few players will opt out of their “I can’t be-
lieve the owners conceded this to us” clause and
sign overseas. The group will consist mainly _of
offensive linemen,‘ backup running backs and
Tarvaris Jackson, but rumors of an aging Tom
Brady signing with Olympiakos for $50 million
per season persist. ,1

The UFL still exists. The league rapidly grew

duringthe 2011 lockout and 2017 strike. The cham-
pion of the UFL — the Las Vegas Locomotives,

Detroit Lions, again _— meet for the ﬁrst time
