Valentines

Freshman David Hefelfinger
stood in front of a shelf of flow-

It was Valentine’s Day, and he
was on the prowl for the ﬂoral
combination that wouldn’t max
out his $20 to $30 budget.

After some internal deliber-

employees, Hefelfinger walked
out after his first trip ‘to Gidas
Flowers, mixed bouquet in hand,
with plans to meet his girlfriend
for dinner. .

Swarms of customers like

Honors College housingto expandinthe fall  

Pitt will transform Brackenridge Hall into the third dormitory dedicated to on-campus honors housing.

By~Megan Triinble
For -The Pitt News

Next school year, Pitt will allo-
cate 300 more beds on campus
to University Honors College
housing. _ '

The fall 2012 planned trans,-
formation ofBrackenridge' Hall
into what will be the third dor-
mitory on campus dedicated to
on—campus honorshousing will
create more “satisfied custom-
ers” out of students, according to

University Honors College Dean-

Edward Stricker.»

And even though Stricker is
working toward making the UHC
less exclusive and more opento
all students, he still wants to
ensure that students who are
“serious about their academics”
have the opportunity to live to-
gether.‘ ,

The additional 300 beds dedi-

cated to honors housing will aug-
ment the 400 beds in Suther-
land Hall and the 100 beds in
the Forbes Craig Apartments

_ currently reserved for UHC stu- -

dents.‘ ‘
‘As of fall 2011, there were

V 7,400 studentbeds on campus.

That number will increase with
the opening of the new 556—bed
dorm at University Place this
fall. A

“The situation is not much
different than the situation that
other students face,” Stricker
said regarding on-campus hous-
ing for honors students. “Pro-

V grams that are run in each dorm

building are catered to the stu-
dents.in residence. In this case,
we are catering to a subset of
the student population that is
serious about themselves, seri-
ous about their academics and
serious about their plans for the
future.” ‘

If a‘ student attains a mini-
mum grade point average of 3.25,
he or she is eligible to apply for
honors housing. Enrollment in
specific honors courses is not
required. ' '

The University selects stu-
dents for honors housing based

_ on application essays and aca-

demic credentials. Stricker said
that the essays require ‘students
to explain, in approximately 250
words, why they want to live in
the dorms and what beneﬁts they
believe they- will receive if their
request is granted. .

Stricker said the UHC looks
to ‘confirm that individuals are
the “serious students” that they
claim to be. He said that rarely
are they faced with instances of
misrepresentation.

There are guidelines that
must be met for admittance into"
UHC courses as well. A 3.25 grade
point average is required for stu-

dents to be automatically eligible
to enroll in honors courses,».but

' those who do not meet the re-
quirement can ask permission
from the professor offering a
course. If professors cannot meet
with students prior to schedul-
ing, UHC advisors can also grant
this permission.

“We are trying to make the
processas easy as possible, but
we are also trying to make sure
it is a sensible, suitablesituation
for each student. And the same
sort of thing applies in regards
to-the dorm selection process,”
Strickersaid.

Organizers envision that
Brackenridge Hall will operate
similarly to Forbes Craig — as a
housing option for honors upper-

’ classmen who are seeking to live

. with other honors students and
participate in programs that ap-
peal to their specific interests.

were expecting to receive to fund
their Floridalcompetitions over
spring break. '
Though SGB has approved re-

quests to fund these trips for the ’

past two years, the Board denied.
the requests at Tuesday night’s
weekly meeting in Nordy’s Place
because of a guideline in the SGB
Allocations Manua. In doing so,
the 2012 Board has followed a
precedent set last week.

The manual says that SGB can— I

not fund trips that conﬂict with
Alternative Spring Break — a
University-sponsored trip that al-
lows students to spend their week
off in March doing community
service work in different partsof
the country.

This funding issue also came
up at last week’s SGB meeting
when Panther Parkour requested
$1,966 to fund a trip to Washing-
ton, D.C., to train during the ﬁrst

half of Spring Break..The club.

members withdrew the request

dreneau said that the Board would

ing it to_the postseason. .
f‘Baseball players need to play
baseball,” said Rob Perkey, the
men’s club baseball team man-
ager. - .

The baseball team requested a-

total of $9,019.75, but the club’s
president, Marc Foster,'said the
team only expected toget about
$5,000. The women’s team re-
quested $4,655.29. ,

Michael Nites, the-Allocations

Committee Chair, could conﬁrm ‘

that SGB‘ funded both‘ teams’
Florida trips for the past two
years. The men’s team received
about $6,000 last year and about
$5,000 in 2010 for the seven-day
trip. - 5

The wo_n_'1en’s team received

_ $2,800 last year for their annual

eight-day trip.

Nites, said that the teams re- '
ceived exceptions in the past from »

the Allocations Manual guideline
because the trip gives the teams
the chance to play many-games in

selling ﬂowers in the early 1900s.’

Things have yet to change since
then.

able scents pervades the shop’s
compact arrangement from top
to bottom, wafting throughout

is aesthetically pleasing, the real
work happens in the back room in
an assembly-line—like process.

ing station where employees ar-

a short time period.
Landrerieau said that SGB de_—

cided not to fund the team’s trips

this year mainly. due to the guide-

line —- which the Board plans to

"continue following, making it a
2012 precedent — of not fund-
ing spring break trips for student

groups. SGB also does not usually_
. fund competitions outside the im-

mediate area — Pennsylvania and
Ohio — unless the team is going
to nationals. ‘ 0

_ This year, the club baseball
team declined to. ask for any

funding during the fall in order '

tormake sure that they would re-
ceive money for this trip.

Foster said that the club has
already sunk about $13,000 of ,
team funds into ﬂights and rental ‘
cars, and they were counting on

the funds from»SGB -to su/bsidi_ze
the rest of the cost of their trip.

Foster said he was aware of the .

SGB policy but still applied for the

funds because exceptions have

been made for them in the past.
Ashley Pallone, president of

V ;the Women’s Fast-Pitch Softball
‘Club, said that the team needs to

take this trip during spring break
because it is the only time that the

Sophomore roommates Joshua Gyory,
and Nuwan Perera have decided to retain
their spot in honors housing next year
and continueliving in the Forbes Craig
Apartments.

“I deﬁnitely value the intellectual at-
mosphere of honors housing,” Gyory said.
“There is a community feel, and we are
never afraid to leave ourldoors "open or
walk into other rooms if people have left
their doors [open.] We’re all friends.”

Perera said that honors housing is deﬁ-
nitely a close-knit community, but both
roommates said they fear that planners
of the expansion could overestimate the

number of students who are looking to live’ i

in honors housing in-the future. .
“What is so great about the Honors Col-

lege is that people care about it,” Perera .

said. “Everybody who is chosen to live
here wants to. But I am not sure if there
will beenough students interested to fill
both Forbes Craig and Brackenridge, and
if people are forced to live in the Honors
College [housing] to fill space, then it will
make the environment less special.”
Pitt spokesman John Fedele said that
there are no potential challenges to mak-
ing the transformation because it will
have a minimal impact on the already

predominately sophomore Brackeriridge ~

dormitory.

“This will allow more students to con-
tinue living in the academically rich and
engaging environment of the Honors Col-
lege,” Fedele said.

Stricker said that he does not view
the approximately 700 beds dedicated
to honors housing as creating a conflict
of interest for the University. T

“The students who are part of the
honors housing are already part of the

Pitt undergraduate population, so we are

not taking beds out of the circulation,”

Stricker said. “We are not diminishing

the pool of ‘beds for those who are seeking
beds, and we certainly are not sequester-

ing them because the beds that University T

students want are the ones they will be

Fedele'- agreed that the reserving of

additional beds for honors students is_

not any different than reserving beds fo
other students. ' ‘ g » '

“They are students who already have
housing guarantees, and this move will
simply create a living—learning community
for them,” Fedele said in an email.

He said the demand for honors hous-
ing has been rising, and more students
regularly apply for this housing than there
are beds available. This prompted UHC
admi_nistrators'to offer students an an-
swer to the problem.

Sophomore Enoch Tse said that he
originally chose to live in honors housing
for the academic community and environ-
ment, but that friends have played a role
in his decisionto remain.

February -15, 2012 I The"Pitt News I wvvw.pittnews.com

“I definitely value
the intellectual
atmosphere of-

honors housing.”

* - Joshua Gyory

1 “My friends decided to stay in hon-
ors hous_ing,'so _I decided to as well,” Tse
said. “It is nice because Forbes Craig has
a lounge that people actually use, and it
is nice to always have people to talk to. If
Brackenridge expands the community for
honorsstudents who are looking for the
same atmosphere, then, for them, signing
up probably just feels right.”

The UHC did not specifically choose
Brackenridge Hall for the transformation;
rather, organizers simply ﬁled a request
for more housing options for their stu-
dents with Pitt’s upper administration,
which then agreed comply with the re-
quest.

“The goal was to come up with a build-

3

ing that was appropriate for sophomore/
junior—sty1e living,” Fedele said. “Brack-

enrid_ge, because it contains suites, was -

a natural place to look.”

Pitt’s UHC provides services for all
students who seek them out, and its ser-
vices are not limited to those who con-
sider themselves members of the Honors
College. '

Stricker said that in no way does Pitt A

need to worry about a sense of elitism
around campus. '

“We don’t present ourselves in a way
that should cause concern,” he said. “We
are not saying that we have something spe-
cial for only one type of student and that
others aren’t allowed to be included.” I

Hey guys, this sh*t’s getting
real, isn’t it? I mean, I lost ﬂyover
country by a pretty signiﬁcant

' margin to an out-of-touch, ho-

mophobic, windbag ex-senator
who couldn’t even get: re—elected
in his home state and a wizened
old kook who probably wouldn’t
stand in your way if you wanted
to sell your children into slavery.
Considering that I’ve got the best
tan, haircut, sweater vests (Rick
Santorum’s don’t even have the
cool little alligator on them!)
and academic pedigree of the
remaining Republican contend-
ers, this is nothing short.of _ri—
donkulous. .. ‘

Let me lay it on the line for
you: I’m your typical all—Amer-
ican success story. My great-
grandparents ﬂed the country
because the federal government
was cracking down on the prac—
tice of polygamy, and my dad was
the governor of Michigan and a
former presidential candidate.
I’ve also amassed a personal for-

tune that’s large enough to allow
me to ‘pay in cash for the Colum-
bus Blue Jackets andlstill have
enough left over to sign portly
Cleveland Browns runningback
Peyton Hillis to a multiyear deal
to wash my laundry. Throw in my
beachfront mansion in La jolla,
Calif., and we’re talking one re-
latable dude, right? V ‘
No? You don’t think I’m re-
latable? Look, if you’re willing
to make a convincing argument
for why Santorum or Ron Paul is
more relatable than me, I’ll give
you $2,500,000. Chicken feed,
to be sure, but times are tough
all over, economically speaking.-
As I noted earlier, I’ve got enough
cold hard cash to purchase the
Bluejackets outright, but I’d need
to borrow against my consider-
able holdings to acquire a bet-
ter—known team like the Cleve-
land Browns‘or the Washington
Wizards. And is that the kind of
country I want my clones  er,
sons to inherit? A country where
they ‘caVn’t just walk out the door,
buy the Washington Wizards and
then kick back while notorious
brick—layers like ]aVale McGee,
Andray Blatche and John Wall
miss shot after shot? No sir, that’s
not Mitt Romney’s America, and
it’s certainly not your America,
either.

let’s talk about corporal punishment

Parents hitting their childrenis something we should address

Andrew Kaback
Columnist.

I was never hit as a child. “Hit” is
not to be confused with getting “hit
on,” which I was regularly experi— -
encing through my middle school
years. What I mean is that my par-

. ents didn’t engage in corporal pun-

ishment. Instead of a ﬁrm hand, I
would get “the look.” One ﬂash of
this look and the knowledge that I
had disappointed my parents was
supposed to compensate for the lack
of a spanking.

‘ Now I know what some of you

might be thinking.- I must have been '

the ultimate weeny. Or maybe Iwas

. just the ‘ultimate awful child, hav-

ing never learned right from wrong.
Probably more along the lines of a
weeny though, right?

I honestly can’t tell you why my
parents decided against corporal
punishment, but I originally imag-
ined it had something to do with
my extreme cuteness as a child. I
eventually decided thatafter turning
me into a Cleveland sports fan they
simply ﬁgured that I was going to
suffer enough throughout my life.

Right before I graduated high
school, the topic of physical pun-
ishment of children came up one
day in ‘sociology class. The class
was discussing how different social
groups have different views toward
child rearing, and the teacher de-
cided to take his own poll. “How
many people in here were raised
without being hit?” It was a simple
enough question, and one that I had
no‘ hesitation in raising my hand»
to answer.

What happened next? Crickets!
I looked around and felt like I had
just confessed to being that kid who

pulled the ﬁre alarm. It was just like
a movie where'the 360—d_egree cam-
era angle showed how completely-
deserted I was in this classroom of

30 people. I could hear the laughter '

and chants coming from the back:
Weeny! Weeny! Weeny! .
The class members then
launched into‘ intense discussions
on the worst they had ever been hit
by their parents, telling stories of
slaps, punches and spankingswith a

' survivor-like pride. It seemed as if I ’

hadmissed out on somensocietal rite
ofpassage thatlwas supposed to go
through with all of my friends. I felt‘
like I should havetaken off my shoes
and walked across burning coals.
Imitations of angry mothers and
stressed fathers issuing threats of
violence were followed by laughter
in this world that was completely

foreign to me. . . -

I was certainly curious after this"
discovery. I had never known that

my upbringing was a somewhat '
unique one. The more‘ that I asked ’
people, the more it se.emed:like_

my parents were downright weird
for never offering up a spanking.
I started reading up on the topic
and looking for related news stories
wherever I could ﬁnd them. .
Recently, a decades—long survey
has been published in the Canadian
Medical Association Journal that

_ approaches this topic that is seem-

ingly so difficult to understand. The
study found a link between receiving
physical punishment and anxiety
and alcohol abuse l_ater in life.
With some studies concluding
that ‘up to 80,percent of Ameri-
can children report growing up in
-homes with corporal punishment,
Iwas most shocked by a very differ-
ent number: Thirty—two countries,
including Sweden, Kenya and Costa

‘Rica, have laws against physical pun-
ishment of children. For something
so commonplace in many Ameri-

can lives, the practice is outlawed in

quite a number of countries.

I can’t tell you what effect physi-
calpunishment had on me, because
I wasn’t physically punished. Yes,
it always seemed very ironic to me

' that kids could be spankedby a par- I

ent saying, “Don’t hit!” with each
pat, but I have no idea whether or

‘not it’s effective. Having beenan
.. elementary and middle sch_ool'wi‘es} '

ltler and, more generally; ajteenagéi
boy,-I’ve had my fair share of physi-
cal struggles, although they were’
never in an attempt to change my
behavior. . - ,. i

As the election year approaches
and the nation debatesmany social
issues, we see topics such as abor-
tion and'gay marriage thrust into

i the limelight. No matter our indi-

vidual political views on the sub-
jects, we are forced to think about
them and critically analyze our own
positions. '

As far as corporal punishment,

however, national discussion has _
been swept under the rug. With ‘

the practice widely removed from
schools, the issue has become one
of what we can and can’t do within
our own families and private homes.
But that shouldn’t mean that nobody
can discuss the topic. -

_ There might be an acceptable
level of responsible physical pun-
ishment, or it might be that every
spanking is harmful. Why can’t we

talk about it? It seems like 32 other ’

countries found the time to at least

I discuss the subject, and it might just

be time for us to_ do so as well. I.

changing those positions dur-
ing the general election, but for
now, you owe me the benefit of
the doubt. '

Then_,there’s this whole gay- .

marriage controversy. Look, I’m a
big believer in marriage. In fact,
if you’re a Mormon supporter of
mine, I’ll even ﬁnd a way to men-

GREGORIAN RANTS

Pireda

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ Writer

The Buffalo Bisons, the Triple-A af-
ﬁliate of the New York Mets, have a
player named Valentino Pascucci. On
chilly summer nights in downtown
Buffalo, the 33-year-old Californian
— at 6-foot—6, 270 pounds —— lumblers
-to the plate to bat for a‘ minor league
franchise that hasn’t made the post-
season in six years. '

Pascucci spent 32 games with the .

Montreal Expos in 2004. He -hit so
poorly (.177) he didn’t sniffthe majors

again until last September, when the _

lowly Mets gave him 11 at-bats as a

September call—up. .
But for the perennial also-rans 0

the International League North, Pas-

cucci is a star in the follow-through l

of his career. Fans witnessed him
dominate the team’s home run derby
againstawiry, 5-foot-10 second base-
man. They also saw him strike out’149
times last year, most of the time with
spectacular, air-splitting cuts. When
he connects, itlands on the entrance
ramp to Interstate 190. ..

Three hours south, the Pittsburgh
Pirates entered February with Alex

- Presley, Andrew McCutchen andjose

Tabata as their starting outﬁelders.
The franchise also brought back for-
mer Pirate outﬁelder Nate McLouth,
who hit .229 in three overpaid sea-

     

sons with Atlanta, as a reclamation

project. ' _ '
Presley, at 26, is the oldest of the

starting trio. McCutchen is 25, and.

_ Tabata is just 23.Jenifer Langoschof

MLB.com wrote that they have “tre-
mendous upside,” which means they

are too young and too unproven to -

be labeled as anything substantive.

I Presley and Tabata are both coming

off injury-plagued years to boot. .
The Pirates, whose highest-paid

1 player is new shortstop Clint Barmes,

won’t sign a big-ticket free agent bat.
To do so would undermine the frugal-

ity the franchise rests on. Pittsburgh _ '

coulduse a discounted A.J. Burnett on
the mound, sure, but it really needs
an outﬁelder to add some pop to the
lineup.

The Pirates need their own Ver-
sion ofValentino Pascucci: a margin-
ally productive box—ofﬁce draw on
the cheap, a name and personality
just slightly bigger than the market
he plays in. Somebody who can’t do
better.

Aging outﬁelders litter the free *
. agent market. JD. Drew, Kosuke Fu-

kudome, Raul Ibanez, Magglio Or-
donez,Johrmy Damon, Hideki Matsui,
Vladimir Guerrero and Xavier Nady
all remain unsigned and are past their
prime — Nady is the youngest at 33.

Guerrero, 37, is a big-league ver— .
. sion of Pascucci. He doesn’t bother

to wear batting gloves. At 6—foot—3, he

than the other. V l

) Guerrero hit .300 with 115 RBIs
two seasons ago with Texas, ‘but he
functioned solely as a designated hit-
ter with Baltimore last year en route
to respectable, yet un-Guerrero—like,

numbers. He’s undoubtedly on the .
V decline. ‘
Accordingto ESPN’s Buster Olney, .

Guerrero let the Yankees know that he

‘ wants to play for them. Unfortunately

for him, though, the Yankees _want
Ibanez instead. 4

Nobody will bite at his $5 million I
asking price. But Pittsburgh fans .
would love to see Guerrero swing at

'— and sometimes make contactwith
— pitches inthe dirt and to watch him
use what’s left of his carmon arm in
right ﬁeld. His style of play would be
a curiosity worth admission.

Drew, 36, might retire. His inju-
ties, bloated paycheck and perceived
laziness overshadowed his produc-
tivity — he still averaged 20 homers

and 73 RBIs betWeen2006_ and2o1o.' .

If Pittsburgh signed him, fans might
show up just to héckle.

Once upon a time, Ordonez, 38,
routinely totaled morethan 30 hom-
ers and 110 RBIs per season with the
White Sox. The Tigers opted not to
resign the Venezuelan veteran this

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Byjasper Wilson
stajffwriter

_On a night when the Pitt women’s basket-

ball team did so many things right, the issue
that has plagued the Panthers thegmost this
season —- turnovers —— proved to be their
downfall.

Pitt (8-17, 0-12 Big East) turned theball 0

over 21 times, compared to just nine turn-

_ overs for the Cardinals. Louisville (19-7, 8-5 .
_ Big East) capitalized on the opportunities,

scoring 18 points off Pitt’s mistakes en route

to a 71-66 win at the Petersen Events Center

Tuesday.night. ' »

The Panthers"12-game losing streak is t

their longest under head coach Agnus Be-

_ rénato, and no Berenato-coached team has

ever failed to win atleast two games in the
Big East. The 2002-2003 team went 2-15 in
conference p1ay.- . e ’

With just four gamesleft on the schedule,
Pitt isin danger of setting a new mark.

Pitt managed to build a seven—point lead.
in the second half, but the Panthers let the ’

advantage slip away.

Pitt guard Brianna Kiesel —-_- who ﬁnished
the game with 22 points -- said it was a mis-
take for her to try and slow the game down
with three minutes left in the contest and
the Panthers holding on to a lead. '

“I’m a freshman and it was a freshman

mistake,” Igiesel said. “I ‘should’ve kept us_

going, because that’s what we were going for

— the game and scoring. And once I started

slowing the ball down, we started_ getting

turnovers and they scored on us.”
Berenato agreed.

"‘We were attacking and all of a sudden

we looked tentative,” Berenato said. “We
didn’t have anyone that took over for that
one minute, and it really hurt us.”

Kiesel hit a baseline jumper off the in-
bounds as the shot clock expired to give the
Panthers a 53-46 lead with 5:02 left in the
game. " ' .

But Louisville battled back and, with two
minutes left in the game, Louisville sopho-
more point guard Shoni Schimmel hit an
NBA-distance 3-pointer and knotted the
game at 55. _

Pitt center Leeza Burdgess —-— who ﬁn-
ished with seven points and seven rebounds
—— regained the lead for the Panthers when
she scored a layup and hit an.ensuing foul
shot to make the score 58-57 with 1:22 left
in the game. . ~

Louisville tied the game with one foul

Pitt women.”s basketball took No. 19
Louisville to overtime on T uesday, but the
Cardinals pulled away ibr a 71-66 win.

muscling her way -‘into the lane where she

released a ﬂoater intraﬂic. But the shot hit 5

iron and, despite their earlierasecond-half
lead, the Panthers went into overtime.

“She gave me the right side,” Kiesel said.
“I’m right-handed and I had a clear way to
the basket. I thought it was going in, but it
just rimmed off on me.”

With both Burdgess and Ashlee Anderson
playing with just one foul to give, Pitt seemed

to be caught between playing aggressive de- _

fense 4 and risk losing two of its most effec-

' tive players —~ or playing conservatively. ‘

The team appeared to choose the lat-

ter, playing pedestrian defense in overtime I

as Louisville went 4-5 from the ﬁeld_on all
layups and 3-4 from the,line in the extra-
period. 1 '

Anderson — who scored 22' points with
the Panthers— went 1-4 from the foul line
in overtime and ﬁnished 3-6 from the foul
line for the game.

“They sent me to the line, and especially
in overtime. And it’s something-I have to do,”
she said. “My mindset for the next game is
to make my free throws.” ‘

The pressure Pitt had easily navigated in
regulation ﬂustered the Panthersin over-
time. Dunn threw an ‘errant pass over the
head .of Kiesel with two minutes left and
Louisville leading 67-66. A

_ With the score 69-66, the Panthers had
a chance to tie the game with just more than
30 seconds left in overtime, but Kiesel’s
close-range effort along the right baseline

hit rim, giving Louisville possession with -

30 seconds left.

- Needing to foul, Anderson’s‘ sent Becky
Burke to the line. Burke made the pair to
push the score to 71-66 and seal the game
for the Cardinals.

Staﬁ” Writer '

After starting the season with a 1-1 Big East
record, the Pitt'women’s tennis team will face
two conference matches this weekend that
could prove key factors in determining ‘the
direction of its season.

After ﬁnishing the 2010-2011 season be-

' low .500 and failing to qualify for the [Big East ._

Tournament, the Panthers strung together an
early three-game winning streak thisseason.
_Pitt currently sits at’4-3 overall. "

The Panthers’ ﬁrst Big East wingcame after
they started tlteyear with a :7-0»vi‘_ctory over

5 St: Bonaventure. The next day,-however, the

team dropped its match on the road against
Penn State. 

Pitt then headed to West Virginia on Feb. ‘

3 to take on the Big Eastrival Mountaineers, a
team the Panthers lost to in the previous three

' seasons. Pitt picked up a 5-2 victory, spurring

the beginning of the three-match win streak
that gave Pitt a valuable Big East win to start
conference play. .
Sophomorejocelyn Lu played a key role in
helping to pick up the victory over the Moun-
taineers.,In No. 1 singles,- Lu defeated West

Virginia’s Emily Mathis in a three-set match (6— _
4, 3-6, 6-3) and paired with.fellow sophomore -

Taylor Washington in No. 1 doubles.to defeat
Mathis and Mary Chupa (8-6).

“Losingto Westvirginialastyearwas really .

tough,” Lu said. “It really motivated us tohit the
ground running. We made sure we all were ﬁred
up for the match and ready to give it all we had
from the get-go.” . , 2

Washington not only contributed to the
doubles victory, but also posted a point in sin-
gles ‘play with her victory over Ikttesh Chahal
in No. 3 singles (6-4, 6-4).

“Beating [West Virginia] was a good conﬁ-
dence builderfor us,” Washington said. “Itwas
a close match, and it really showed that we can
overc_ome any kind of obstacle.”

The win over West Virginia provided mo-
mentum for the Panthers in their next two
matches.'The Panthers defeated Bucknell by
a 6-1. tally the day after defeating the Moun-
taineers. -

February 15, 2012 1 The Pitt News | www.pittnews.Comy

(hope to build f 
start to season

The streak carried into last weekend, when
the Panthers dominated St. Francis in a 7-0
shutout victory at home on Friday. '

“it was really good to have awin streak early
on,” Washington said. “It gave us conﬁdence
and put teams on notice that we are ready to
compete.” _

But the Panthers lost 6-1 to Georgetown
on Saturday in their second Big East match
of the year. ‘ .

' Pitt’s only point came from.Washington’s
Victory in No. 3 singles against Kelly Comolli
— a match forced into a tiebreaker that Wash-
ington won by two points (7-5, 4-6, 10-8).

Pitt fell again at home on Sunday against the
New jersey Institute of Technology in a close
4-3 match. The Panthers took the doubles point
with victories in No. 2. doubles by Gabrielle
Catanzariti and Kimmy Borza and N o..3 doubles
by Amanda and Molly Wickman. ' A

In singles, the Highlanders rallied to win '

four of six matches to overcome their deﬁcit
and pull out the Victory. At the No.1 spot, Lu
defeated Ksenia Kuzmenko in straight sets (6-
2, 6-2), and Washington won in No. 3 singles
. against Monika Graff (6-3, 6-3) to post two
more points for Pitt. ‘ .
But N]IT took the remaining four singles
matches to seal the win. Pitt head coach George
Dieffenbach said‘ the match willhelp the Pan-
thers learn. .
“Today’s match was a challenge,” he said.

“Despite the loss, the Panthers battled and L V V’

competed strong. The bright spot was that we
won the doubles point._We will improve as a
result of this contest.” _ ~ *
' Although the Panthers played well this
weekend, Washington said’ that playing three
matches in three days certainly became-a fac-
tor. ‘
A The matches took a toll on the team, both
physically and mentally, Washington said.
She added that it becomes difficult to focus
on each individual match and thestyle of the
opposing playerwhen playing matches so close
together. ' .
Fortunately for Pitt, the Panthers have
more than a week before their next matches,
for which they’ll head to Cincinnati for the

weekend. The team will face Cincinnati on Feb. '

24 and Connecticut on Feb. 25. ’ﬁ

away after some consideration, accordingto the
Detroit Free Press. He has no contract offers. '
But the Pirates have two young Venezuelan

' outﬁelders in Tabata and Gorkys Hernandez.

Ordonez could go 0-for-4 nightly and still have

value to Pittsburgh if Tabata improves under

his guidance. .
Nady paid off once for the Pirates when they
traded him to the Yankees in a deal that sent

Tabata.andJeffKarstens to Pittsburgh. Signing
Nady three months after luring McLouth back
' would be the baseball equivalent of “The Blues
Brothers.” L
Signing free agent Milton Bradley, last seen
‘ in the majors in May, would be the equivalent
of“Slap Shot.” - '
Matsui, one ﬁnal possible Pascucci,'brings

with him the nickname “Godzilla.” He won the A

World Series Most Valuable Player Award in
2009, and then he posted a strong season with
the Angels and another with the Athletics — so
he might actually still have one or two useful years
in him before he becomes Pirates fodder. j
