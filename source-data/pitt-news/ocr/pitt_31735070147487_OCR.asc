A Pitt freshman walks into Tow-
ers lobby, dragging a wooden
sword on the ground as he weaves
through the crowd, trying to bal-
ance the armor strewn across his
shoulders.

He scrambles to ﬁnd his Pitt
ID, carefully making sure he

doesn’t drop his gear. When he ‘
reaches his room, he chucks the if
clunking armor under his twin_ . f
bed and leans the sword against?

the closet wall.

it is one that current club mem-

former member said that when
she attended Pitt nearly 13 years

ago club members could often be

seen donning their armor in the
dorms, but recently, enrollment
has been low, and the unusual club
is barely active.

student membership as similar

Freshman Marty Robertswas getting
readyforbedalittle alterz am. Mon-
day morning when he heard a loud
pop and the sound of rushing water.

He walked over to his door to
look out the peephole. Roberts lives
in Room E813, perpendicular to the
trash room on the eighth ﬂoor of
Sutherland Hall East.

“At ﬁrst I thought that someone
was showering in there, because that
would have been really weird,” Rob-
erts said later.

Roberts saw smoke and water

spewing out of the top of the door.

The ﬁre alarm started going off.

“Uh, we have to go,” Roberts told
his roommate, realizingthat it wasn’t
aﬁre drill. .

The small ﬁre brought the city ﬁre
department, Pitt police and city police.
Students evacuated into the cold night
where they stayed for aboutan hour
until they could re-enter. More than a
dozen rooms had water damage from
the incident, across several ﬂoors.

“I wasn’t really scared or any-
thing,” Roberts said. “After I saw the
smoke and water, Ithought awaterline
must have broke.”

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said in
an e-mail that a burning bag of pop-
com discarded into atrashcan caused
the ﬁre. No residents reported any
injuries. The small ﬁre triggered the
sprinkler system in the trash room
and the stairwell, sending water into

include failing to recycle entirely or

Pitt increasing recycling efforts

Recycling 4 2

percent of our total wastestream and in ﬁscal
2009 we recycled 42.3 percent of our total waste
stream,” Zullo said.

In 2005, the University sought to increase
the visibility of its "recycling program by add—
ing more receptacles. And with the approach
of the RecycleMania competition, a national
competitionbeginninginFebruary to see which
university can recycle the most, the housing
department is working to add more receptacles
to residence halls.

In addition, the University has also increased
the types of materials it recycles.

“We recently changed the plastics recycling

program to accept plastic grades one through
ﬁve. It used to be that we accepted only grades
one and two. We now recycle batteries as well
and we’ve also recycle construction and demoli-
tion debris for the past couple of years,” Zullo
said.‘

With the emphasis on recycling on campus,
students seem to be doing their part. -

“We requested recycling'bins so we can col-
lect our recyclables in our apartment before

. bringing it to the bins outside,” junior Alyssa

‘ Lyons said; ‘in Bouquet, the University seems to
pro mote it more, and I feel better about recycling
here because it’s almost like it’s my home.” I

The groups work with weapons made

Usually the weapons are wrapped in duct
tape to give them a metallic look. Group
members also purchase or make helmets

Students can make at least two weapons
out of the standard 10 -to -12 foot long rat-
tan stick. Rattan costs between $10 and
$20, and students can-make armor out of
plastic milk containers. The -helmets typi-
cally cost the most because they are made

A‘ the knees, and if an arm or leg is,hit, then

that soldierican not play with that limb.

‘ Judging “kills” depends on a code of
chivalry. It is solely a judgment call for the
struck knight to decide if he has in fact been

killed. The system works well, members -

said, as chivalry is a founding principle

Should Pitt screen
for depression?

A neuJ study suggeststhat the Student Health
Service could be doing more

hances are that a student
you know isstruggling with
depression.

And unfortunately it’s possible
that student isn’t receiving the
treatment he or she needs.

As the rate of diagnosed depres-
sion in college students hovers
between 10 and 20 percent, de-

; spite most colleges’ best efforts,

collegiate depression often goes
unnoticed and unreported. A 2008
study from researchers at Emory
University found that 85 "percent
of surveyed students who screened
positive for depression were not re-
ceiving treatment, and a 2004 Har-
vard Medical School study found
the delay between onset of mental
health symptoms and treatment is
on average more than a decade.

Depression is the most common
mental disorder. .

It is associated with reduced in-
terest or pleasure in daily activities,
feelings of worthlessness, risk of
self-injury, falling GPAs and a hor-
ror that too regularly afflicts the
Pitt community —— suicide.

There’s no doubt our University
proactively combats depression.
The 2,000-or-so students who
visit the Counseling Center each
year and the University’s ongoing
involvement in the Talk About It
+ formerly Talk To Me —— depres-
sion awareness campaign conﬁrm
this. According to James Cox, the
director of the Counseling Center,
identiﬁcation of mental health is-
sues is emphasized as well. “We
are actively involved and consult
with the Oﬂice of Residence Life
staff, concerned friends, parents
and faculty regarding students who
may suffer from depression and

other mental health problems,” he A

said in an e-mail.

It’s tough to judge the efficacy
of counseling services, and with-
out the proper resources, we won’t
try. But in light of a research paper
published this month in the Ameri-
canjournal of Orthopsychiatry, we
think the way Pitt identiﬁes stu-
dents needing treatment for de-
pression could be improved.

In the study, scientists based
at the University of Wisconsin
surveyed college students'at four
university health clinics located
in the Midwest, the Northwest

and Canada. Consistent with pre- .

vious research that found a higher
prevalence of depression among
people utilizing primary health
care than the general population,
they similarly found higher-than-
average rates of depression in stu-
dents who visited their university
clinics. Backedby their results,

the paper’s authors argue for the '

“routine screening for depression
in all students seeking routine care
in college health clinics.”

If extrapolated to Pitt, their
proposal would affect the Student
Health Service. Although it does
ask students to indicate a past his-
tory of mental health problems at
their initial visit, Student Health
“does not routinely have students

complete a depression screen at _

every visit,” Elizabeth Wettick, di-
rector of Student Health, said in
an e-mail. -

Even as Pitt has stressed mental
health awareness and as the Coun-
seling Center serves more students
each year, we think the authors cre-
ateda new opportunity to enhance
Pitt’s services. Screening students

for depression at Student Health _

could have drawbacks — such as
potentially reducing demand for
appointments — but at least a pilot
program is worth exploring.

Student Health screens offer
the ability to cast a wider net in
which to catch those who could re-
ally beneﬁt from help, but would
otherwise shy away from publicly
displaying their needs.

Making that ﬁrst step — realiz-
ing the need to get help and contact-
ing the appropriate professionals
— can be hard for many people, but
a simple survey_at Student Health
could make it a little easier.

If a few more harmless ques-
tions on the Student Health intake
form could make a positive differ-

ence — of any size — in students’

lives, why not try? I

Have a DREAM?      
Republicansdon’t    

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

Pathetic. Next to Congress’ failure

to pass the DREAM Act last year, ‘

only Pitt’s recent struggle to ﬁnd
a head coach could compare in
embarrassment.

When it became evident that
the DREAM Act, which would have
allowed immigrants who were
brought to the United States as mi-
nors a chance to become citizens
over time with military service or
educational training, would slip
through the cracks of rhetoric and
ignorance, I felt that our repre-
sentatives had fai1ed.~I don’t mean
failed like when our football team
renamed’ the Backyard Brawl the
Backyard Give Up at Halftime — I
mean failed like Ralph Nader run-
ning for president.

The DREAM Act would have
served as one of .the ﬁrst steps
toward a logical solution to the
immigration problems this coun-
try faces. Instead our Senate was

almost as bad as the stream of
sequels _to “Pirates of the Carib-
bean.” ' - '
Maybe they were just trying to
preserve America? After all, if you
follow conservative pundits, you’ll
know that the DREAM Act’s poten-
tial beneﬁciaries are drug-running
criminals who don’t even know
how to speak English.AOther than
Canada, Belgium, India, China, Is-
rael and some other no—namers,
how can acountry ever have more
than one language widely spoken?
Outside of California,‘ Massachu-

l setts and the other centers of sin

that now have decrimiinalized
marijuana, no respectable worthy

Americans could have anything to

do with drugs.

But I’ll buyit. I will. As disgust-
ing as it is that partisanship al-
lowed sensibility to be thrown by
the wayside, I will give a break to«

. those ﬁlibustering senators. I will

refrain from calling them out as
spineless fear-mongerersand trai-
tors to the American dream  OK,
maybe I didn’t-refrain. Maybe we

weren’t ready for the DREAM Act

and maybe it needed to be sym— _

RADVICI-lLS FOR MODERATES

 

After Tucson, Iet’s Vfixrottingi maw of civil discourse

Brendan Sullivan
Columnist

In the summer of 1907, Wall Street
had a little freakout. The sale of
a major copper production com-
pany had gone sour, and because
of the intensely complicated and
esoteric workings of the national
economy, credit began to contract
and people began to feverishly
withdraw their money from some
banks perceived as weak. The for-
mula is fairly routine — contrac-
tion, panic, further contraction
—— and it should be familiar to
those of us who’ve been awake
over the past few years.

In response to this most re-
cent recession, the government
stepped in with former President
George W. Bush’s Troubled Asset
Relief Program and later President
Barack Obama’s stimulus‘ package.
These governmental responses
were necessary — somewhat
akin to cauterizing your own bul-
let wound as you’re ﬂeeing from d
an assailant. Since the measures
passed, the economy is showing
signs of life. But in any case, as
unemployment lingers, the body

politic’s still in a great amount of
pain, and nobody’s happy with
one another. “

In 1907, however, recovery

came in a different form —— the.

form of a septuagenarian J. P.
Morgan. This was the man who
wielded more power on Wall
Street than anyone before or af-
ter. When Morgan’s banks and
trusts began to fail, he stepped
in, organizing relief committees
of ﬁnanciers to raise millions of

- dollars toensure liquidity in cer-

tain failing companies. This was
not charity, of course. While real-
izing that a prosperous economy
was to his beneﬁt, Morgan made

calculated decisions that propped;

up certain ﬁrms but allowed oth-

ers to fail. _
Incredible asthese personal

monetary commitments were,

even more incredible was the

way that the business commu-
nity banded not only together
but with the Secretary of the
Treasury George Cortelyou, who
provided $25 million to the relief
cause from government coffers. A
combination of the private ‘and
public sectors working together

I can barely conceive a similar
cooperation today.

But in light_of the political
response to the recent shoot-
ings in Tucson, Ariz., politicians

should start learning these col-.

laborative skills. Beginning on
Sunday morning, on a special
edition of “Meet the Press,” our

In 1907, individuals and the
government came together for
the beneﬁt of the larger group. But
to_day an inhospitably adversarial
culture has surpassed itself.

The problem we face today is
not one of excessive rhetoric or
targets on congressional maps.
It is a problem of a hugely adver- .
sarial culture among the power-

a ful. The laissez-faire economists

‘assume the worst of any regula-

hopefully harmonious function-

business.

A Horriﬁc as the tragedy in Tuc-
son was, it was not the product
of overexposure to Fox News. It
was a random act of violence just
like those that occur every day in
this country. To take this event
and make weightless pledges of
civility is weak. It is a decision
derived from the least amount
of introspection possible. This is
a country where random acts of
violence occurred before political
invective and will continue long
after it is gone. We cannot really
allow ourselves to avoid looking
deeper into the rotting maw of
civil relationships.

   fay Agenda’ brings gay news to Pitt

 

Jennifer Hirsch
Staﬁ" Writer

With two shows already behind
them, Pitt student Kevin Ramser
and his friend, Pitt alumnus Mi-

, chael Elko, have already settled

comfortably into their roles as
co—hosts of “The Gay Agenda,” a
new show on the University radio
station WPTS. _

_ “The Gay Agenda” airs every
Thursday from 4:30 to 5 p.m.
and currently serves as Pitt’s
only broadcast devoted to ad-
dressing issues affecting the gay
community. Elko said he believes
it is the only station in the city
to do so.

Although Elko graduated
from Pitt in 1989, he rekindled
a relationship with the Univer-
sity when Ramser asked him to
co-host what would become his
second broadcast on the station.
Last semester, Ramser was part of
the team that created “The Love

WPTS sponsors concert for

Located in the hazy Andean highlands of ‘

Columbia, the mythical School of Seven
Bells will teach you how to expertly pick a
pocket without getting caught — at least,
that’s if you believe the legend. ’
Learning about this school that might
or might not have existed in the 1980s late

one night from a PBS documentary, Ale— ',

jandra Deheza decided that the best way
to perpetuate the myth was to name her
band after it. Thus, the School of Seven Bells
lives on in the form of a two—person band,
consisting of Deheza and fellow musician

Benjamin Curtis:

 ‘-24

  
 

 "~-._, .-

Benjamin Curtis. The duo will perform this
Friday at Mr. Smalls in a concert sponsored
by Pitt’s radio station 92.1 WPTS and Opus
One Productions.

School of Seven Bells formed in the
spring of20o6 after Deheza and Curtis met
while their bands, (On!Air!Library! and Se-
cret Machines, respectively) were touring
with Interpol.

- “We just kind of hit it off. When it was
time to go our separate ways, we decided
what we had was too good,” Curtis said.

Both experienced musicians, Curtis and
Deheza found that their new collaboration
opened doors for a different kind of song-
writing experience.

“Yeah, it’s totally different but not inten-
tionally so. The collaboration is just differ-

’ ent; we don’t approach songwriting from a

band point of view. I’m way not familiar with
it. I almost don’t want to know,” Curtis said
of the process. “_I’m afraid'we’ll lose it”

Unlike their previous musical ventures,
the members of School of Seven Bells focus
on the lyrics of a song ﬁrst and then arrange
the instrumentation. Lyrics are more ab-
stract, but they do have an overall message
and make sense in context.

“Lyrics come really early on. Usually
we start with a sound or an atmosphere.
We ﬁgure out what the song is saying and
then write from there,” he said.

Both Deheza and Curtis" have almost
haunting voices, which when combined
with synthesizers and uneven beats, give
School of Seven Bells an electronic yet ethe-
real sound. Often described as a kind of
dreamy pop, the band’s progressive sound
has made a home on radio stations like
Pitt’s WPTS.

“WPTS chose to sponsor the School of
Seven Bells show because the bandwis fre-
quently played on our station. I believe the
band can appeal to a collegiate demographic
due to their fresh and crisp sound,” Pokuaa
Owusu, WPTS promotions director, said
via e—mail. I ‘

Owusu described the band as “shoegaze”
i-n the way that their more electronic sound
is inﬂuenced by the distortion and reverb-
ﬁlled music.’ She_added that the band’s so-
called ethereal sound is relaxing for listen-
ers of any demographic but maybe more so

  - as  

for students.

“This band is pretty indicative of our

‘progressive format’. Their second album,
Disconnect From Desire,-was released in
July and was immediately hailed by crit-
ics. It also received.a lot of plays from our
station. It’s airy, shoegaze—inﬂuenced pop
that’s still quite danceable at times,” Ga-
briela DiDonna, music director for WPTS,
said via e—mail. _ .

This isn’t the ﬁrst time WPTS has col-
laborated with Opus One to produce a show.
“On our end, we work to promote the event
with on-air promotions and ticket give-
aways for our listeners. An artist won’t suc-
ceed if nobody knows that they are playing
a show,” DiDonna said.‘

At a typical School of Seven Bells show,
Curtis said the band will play different types
of styles — including acoustic and crazy
dance party — claiming that the band’s
music lends itself to various musical tech-
niques. According to Curtis, the college—age
demographic is the one that School of Seven
Bells usually appeals to most.

“They’re the people who seem to come.
Pittsburgh students are a little smarter
though, right?” he joked.

It also devoted time to address the run of
gay teen suicides at the end of the year and
Dan Savage’s “It Gets Better” project— an
effort that encourages celebrities, politi-
cians and regular people to reach out to
gay teens. _i ,
The second “Gay Agenda” broadcast
last week was largely devoted to discussing
how gay intern Daniel Hernandez helped
save Rep.. Gabrielle Giffords’, D—Ariz., life
during the Tucson, Ariz., shooting earlier
this month. Tonight on “The Gay Agenda,”
the hosts plan to discuss the issue of teen '
homelessness in the gay community.
Though the show focuses on some seri-

r ous issues, its names “pokes fun at radical

elements in society [that insist] gays have
an agenda to plot and take over the world,”
Elko said. ’ l
So- many of the news stories about the
gay community are about “victories being
won” as if it’s aiming for world domination,
Ramser said. A " '
“They think we’re trying_to assimilate
and then take over,” he said.
' Thus the two men are, using the show
as a springboard to discuss issues affect-

ingthe gay community and to promote

awareness —— not tolerance.

“I hate the word ‘tolerance.’ It promotes
a hierarchy,” Elko said. “It’s awareness that
sheds light on ignorance.”

The hosts hope to add diversity to the

show by inviting guests to educate listen-
ers on certain issues, but they admit that
securing the guests can be frustrating.
“There is a strong connotation with the
word ‘gay,”’ Elko said as he explained why
some people might be hesitant to speak on

r a gay news radio show.

For now, the two said they are satisfied
with providing a voice and support system
for the gay community at Pitt. n

“One thing that prevents a community
from becoming a culture is that culture is
learned,” Elko said. “In cultures, people
get support from their parents or their
neighbors. The gay community doesn’t
have that advantage.” ' ' '

All young people feel alone.at one time

or another, but it can be exponentially I
' greater among gay’ youth, the hosts said.

“The Gay Agenda” might currently be

' the only news show. at Pitt dedicated to is—

sues affecting the gay community, but it is
not the ﬁrst of its kind. WPTS News Direc-
tor Richard White said that from 1992-93
Pitt aired another show focused on the
gay community. He could not provide the
‘name of theshow. ' - ' '

“Unfortunately, we don’t havetimuch of

an archive,” he said. , , «

a He echoed the two hosts’ beliefnthat
“The Gay Agenda” is the only gay—dedicat—
ed news show in Pittsburgh now.

“We’re Pittsburgh’s progressive FM,” he ‘

said. “We ‘bring perspective to the news.”.

the role of middleweight championjake La
Motta, De Niro engaged in a rigorous train-
ing regiment, sparring some 1,000 rounds
with La Motta himself and, according to
Vanity Fair, La Motta suffered chipped teeth,
blackeyes and a broken rib, courtesy of De
Niro. Thankfully, the hard work paid off: In
addition to netting an Oscar for his perfor-

_mance, the actor engaged in three profes-
, sional bouts and won two of them.

Of course, De Niro’s physical condition-
ing wasn’t limited to one ﬁlm — the actor
ground his teeth to portray the degenerate
Max Cady in “Cape Fear” — but “Raging .
Bull” is still cited as a pinnacle of method
acting and ﬁlm in general.

occurred during the shooting of the 1993 '

ﬁlm “In the Name of the Father,” about a man
wrongfully convicted of committing an Irish
Republican Army bombing and subsequently
sent to prison. In preparation for c_onvey-
ing the ordeal, Lewis conﬁned himself to
a frigid cell for three nights and asked that
those on the.set, according to the London
Evening Standard, “abuse him” and hurl
water on him.

The game Monday night between
No. 4 Pitt and No. 3 Syracuse had
a Final Four feel to it. Two Big East
programs with incalculable depth,
impeccable coaching and seemingly

, 3 no weaknesses collided.

But will Pitt or Syracuse make it

  to Houston? There are six teams that
V E" have risen above the rest — and they

don’t call it the Final Six. That doesn’t
even have alliteration. So which four

will advance?

No. 1 Ohio State: In

Statistically speaking, Ohio State
can barely outrebound Southeast
Missouri State. The Buckeyes are
150th in the nation inrebounding.
But if you’ve seen them play this
year, you know that nobody can stop

Jared Sullinger. Teams can limit his ’

touches, double-team him or place
a beehive under the rim, but he’s
still going to end up with a double-
double. ‘

Combine Sullinger with some
of the best passers and perimeter
shooters inthe country, and you have

a Final Four team.
No. 2 Kansas: Out

they can make it to Houston. Can
you tell I have a love-hate relation-

If you’ve seen this team play
this year, you know that no-

The Jayhawks look fantastic on
paper. They have size and skill. They
rebound. They score more than 83
points per game. Yet I don’t think

body can stop Jared Sullinger.

Kansas put up 113 points against
the Longwood Lancers. Congratula-
tions. Unfortunately, I don’t think

 Mid—season front runners to make Final Four-

3  Ohio State tops the list whereas perennial powers Kansas, Duke don’t quite make the cut to play in Houstonthis April

the Lancers will be an Elite Eight op-

ponent. Kansas beat UCLA by 

USC by two, Nebraska by three,
California by ﬁve and Iowa State by
ﬁve and Michigan by seven in over-
time. Some — mostly Midwestem—
ers —- call this “coming through in
the clutch,” but it also shows the
Jayhawks’ proclivity to play doiﬁs.

probably in the Tournament.

Competition, challenges

Wrestling < 11

  fuel brothers’ success

 

' john Elster I Staff .Photographer

. Pitt’s Donnie Tasser (left) has helped to serve as a mentor to his younger brother P.J., a

all of the brothers being underclassmen,
the team could have six brothers in its top
10 in the upcoming season.

Aside from just being a rarity, the broth-
ers are even "more intriguing in how they en-
courage and challenge each other through-
out the season. They all show a large amount
of respect for each other and what they can
accomplish as a whole.

“He’s been a pathgblazer for our family,”
P._]. Tasser saidof his brother, Donnie. “Being
able tonot just learn from his mistakes but
learn from him in general, having him as an
example has really helped.”

P.J. and,Donnie are both just pieces of a
family, puzzle that hopes to continueﬁa strong
competitive wrestling tradition.

“My dad also wrestled Division I,’’ B].

said. “Hopefully one day my little brother I

will, too, and then we can all share that.”

Not surprisingly, the competition doesn’t
stop at the mats.

“Even [while] playing pool or video
games, I want to beat him,” B]. said of Don-
nie. “He wants to beat me, my dad wants to
beat all of us, and my little brother just wants
to beat somebody.”

Even as the oldest, Donnie agrees that
wrestling his brother has always brought out
a certain type of competitiveness in him.

“When I’m wrestling my brother in prac~

tice, it’s not just practice,” Donnie said. .

“Even there, I don’t want to get taken down
by my brother. I don’t want him to score
points on me.”

Tyler and Matt —— who are both techni-
cally “inactive” this season and are also in

. separate weight classes as well as the Tasser ‘

brothers —— continue to ﬁnd ways to compete
with each other.

redshirt freshman for the Panthers.

Matt, who weighs 197 lbs., said of his
157-lb. brother Tyler, “Lucky for him, he cut
down enough weight so he doesn’t have to
wrestle me in the room/ We still compare
our mile—times and things like that.”

Much like the Thomusseits, the Wilps
have the same age difl'erence,.with Matt be-
ing a junior and Tyler just in his freshman
year. Matt also serves as a mentor to his
younger brother,

. Matt acknowledges an interesting posi-
tive of having your brother as a teammate,
even though he is usually the one doing the
teaching. _ V

“I understand how he thinks about the
sport and I can help him even more now. It’s
just moved up alevel. There is so much more
to the sport than there was in high school,”
Matt said. “You can be more critical to your
sibling. You can tell him exactly what is on
your mind, so I think that’s a good thing.”

In the history of athletics, there have .

been other memorable sets of brothers.
From Vince,Joe and Dom DiMaggio as well
as the Griﬂin brothers, Blake and Taylor —
who dominated the Oklahoma basketball
scene — brothers have always been pushing
each other to greatness in their respective
ﬁelds. .

With at least one more season to look
forward to as a group, the expectations are
inﬁnite. But no matter the individual success

’ 4 of these brothers, the family—like bond on the

team isn’t going to waver anytime soon.

“There’s a really good bond on the team.-
Everyone’s close and knows each other really
well,” Max Thomusseit said.
