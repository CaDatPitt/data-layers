{(;lJ;i4::te1l:JMB\E7:;6eekend Announced;
l~ Talent Show Added t o Plans

MONDAY, DECEMBER 7,9 1964
Thermodynamics Center 9
  Established; Fitterer

To Direct Research

 

A talent show will mark the begin-
ning of Winter Weekend, 1965, Feb. 4-6.
In a report to the Student Government

T Winter Weekend Committee, general

chairman Sherree Merenstein outlined the
events of the Weekend.

After the talent show Thursday night,
there will be a dance on Friday. Saturday
will begin with skiing, skating, and slep riding
at a ski lodge, as yet unnamed. Buses will be
available to the lodge.

Saturday night there will be a carnival held
in the Student Union. Miss Merenstein urged
groups to consider operating booths at the car-
nival, since last year some organizations grossed
65 dollars from carnival proceeds.

At the meeting last Thursday night, SG

* -. passed a. resolution recommending" that teachers

refrain from scheduling exams on Feb. 5 and
Feb. 8 so that students could participate fully
in the Weekend.

Michael Libo will serve as Weekend business '

manager and Marcia Malvin as ticket manager.
Jean Adamchic and Neal Colton are chairmen
of the talent show; Harriet Hersh and Jim Gold-
ing, dance committee chairman.

Gerri Siegal and Ray Baum head the Satur-
day event committee and Judy Ruebush and Bob
Franklin the carnival committee. Barbara Elman

— will serve as hospitality committee chairman and

Sue Heiker will direct publicity. _
SG also passed a resolution establishing a
class organization committee. Senator Mark Se-
nick, who introduced the bill, explained that the
committee’s main purpose will be to facilitate
alumni activities. SG established class commit-
tees forthe graduating classes of 1965 and 1966.
Senator Senick urged the passage of the bill
because there are many activities after gradua-
tion which require class organization. Under the
trimester system, where seniors complete their
requirements for graduation in December, April,
or August, the class composition is constantly
changing, and there is little class unity.

L There is a- resolution before SG to make the
class organization committee a standing one. It
will vote on the amendment at the ﬁrst SG meet-
ing next trimester.

SG ratiﬁed the selection of Miss Beverly
Reifman as the chairman for Tap Dayfor 1965.

She was recommended by student leaders who '

interviewed candidates for the position.

The University has established a center for the study I‘ " i

of thermo-dynamic properties of materials. under the direc-
tion of Dr. G. Raymond Fitterer, director of research and
Distinguished Professor of Metallurgical Engineering. Dr.
Fitterer was formerly chairman of the Metallurgical Engi-
neering Department and Dean of the School of Engineering

 

.and Mines.

Thermodynamics, the study of -
heat-behavior, is a relatively new
fundamental science. The Center
will be devoted to applying ther-
modynamic principles to metal-
lurgical materials and processes
to develop new materials and to
determine their high temperature-
low pressure behavior.

Special equipment is now be-
ing installed in Engineering and
Thaw Halls. The laboratory in
Thaw Hall occupies the entire
fourth ﬂoor. The Center is being
ﬁnanced by grantsfrom industry,
a government agency, and by pri-
vate contributions. .

Dr. 0. Kubaschewski, principal
scientiﬁc officer of the National

  Mellon Lecture Series

 Scheduled for Monday

Dr. Dragan Plamenac, visiting-. Andrew Mellon» Profes-
sor of music, will speak Monday in the Andrew Mellon Lec-
ture Series on “Music and Society in the ‘Late Middle Ages.”
The speech will be given at 8:15 p.m. in the auditorium of

the Graduate School of Public Health.

Dr. Plamenac is professor emeritus and past chairman
of the division of musicology at the University of Illinois.

He studied musicology at the Uni- ’

versity of Paris and the Univer-
sity of Vienna and received his
Ph.D. from Vienna University.
Issuing publications on the ear-
ly baroque and a large number
of studies on music from the
14th to 18th centuries, he has

l_ also published journals in the
‘United States and abroad. The

American Musicological Society
published his edition of the col-
lected works of Johannes Ockeg-
hem, a 15th century composer.

Dr. Plamenac has discovered
signiﬁcant unknown sources of
old music and manuscripts in the
Royal Libraryat Copenhagen and
in the University Library at Pa-
dua. He has also served as vice-
president of the American Mu-
sicological Society. In 1947, he
was a. recipient of a Guggenheim
Fellowship, and later several
awards by the American Council
of Learned Societies.

The lecture is open to the pub-

Cooley Favors Abolishing
‘Unnecessary’ Committee

Thomas M. Cooley, dean of the School -of Law, is sup-“  V
porting the abolition of the House Committee on Un—Ameri--  "
can Activities (HUAC). He is one of a hundred constitu- “ 
tional law authorities who have petitioned the House of '9

Representatives.

The petitioners feel that there is no real reason for the  

existence of a separate committee in Congress, said Dean

said Sherwood Lingenfelter, dep-
uty chairman of the Advising
Center.

Leroy Brown Concludes Jazz Series

 

By LARRY BERNFELD .

The Leroy Brown Quartet appeared in the final PM
series jazz concert of the fall trimester, Thursday evening
in the SU lower lounge. 

The quartet, until the second half of the program, gave
the impression that they specialized in dinner music, not
jazz. From the beginning of “Green Dolphin Street” to the
closing bars of “Ow,” however, the group played. a series of
well-known jazz pieces that were received with approval by a smaller
than usual PM audience. ‘ -

The success of the second half of the program can be attributed
to a sudden awakening in the drummer, Bob Story. The musicians.
as soloists, all had their virtues. Leroy Brown on bass guitar provided
a strong foundation for the clear tones of lead sax man, Jose Gon-
zales Taylor. Pianist George “Duke” Spaulding performed with a
pleasing, light touch and exhibited a technique that indicated a solid
musical background.

Yet, the first half of the program was relatively dead. Brown,
Spalding and Taylor all indicated that they could function well as
soloists; but together, the group lacked an essential cohesiveness. This

unity was provided by drummer Bob Story in the second half of the A V

program’ when he; began playing like he ﬁnally had a story to tell..-

Cooley. They charge that the existence of the Committee “is irrecon--_ 4 " '9
cilable with a system of free expression in this coun ." ’ i .. ..
I The signers, all professors, law  ;,
school deans, and lay authorities, ' ST »;
declare that HUAC’s activities;  l }_
have hindered new ideas and new‘; _.

approaches to problems “which;-‘

face us in a rapidly changing 7:_._._'

world.”

Pointing out that adequate

authority for investigations of in-

ternal security matters already .1 

exists in the Judiciary Committee,
they are asking that the House re-'
fuse to continue HUAC as a stand-

ing committee when Congress " 
convenes January 4. At that time, , - 

when the new house rules are

ed.

The petitioners note that the ‘

sole power which Congress gives.

to HUAC is to‘ investigate ‘“un-1 --

Aznerican propaganda activities“

and “subversive and un-American 
propaganda.” They also declare” 

that HUAC’s jurisdiction “is thus

‘limited to inquiring into ideas, V
opinions, speech, and other forms 

of expression.” V

 Interviews:

    

By MARVIN zunxowrrz

(Acting Attorney General Nicho-
las Katzenbach spoke here last

' , Tuesday at Stephen Foster Mem-

orial on “C't'm'l Rights: Yester-
day, Today, and Tomorr/row.”)

“Acting” Attorney Gener-
al Nicholas Katzenbach con-
siders himself THE Attor-
ney General. He doesn’t an-
ticipate any changes in his
position in the near future,

  and is conﬁdent that he will

remain as attorney general.

“I'll be here as long as Presi-
dent Johnson wants me,” he said.
“But _I don’t know long he'll
want me. He’s the only one who
could answer that."

Katzenbach, however, does not
consider his appointment tem-
porary. “I’m the attorney gen-
eral,” he said. “As far as I can

- tell there is no ‘interim’ in front
1 of my. title.”

Katzenbach will
perform as if “I’m in this job for
the rest of my life. I’ll serve for
the next 60 years if I’m asked.”

In the next few years Katzen-
bach expects to see an even
wider acceptance of the Civil
Rights Act he has been vigorous-
ly enforcing. Katzenbach had ex-

“ plained in his lecture that dis-

2 Philosophy

Lectures Set .

Dudley Shapere, professor of
philosophy at the University of
Chicago, will deliver two lectures

in the Philosophy of Science

series today and tomorrow at
8:15 p.m. in Clapp Hall auditori-
um. The general topic is “Mean-

C ing and Scientiﬁc Change.”

Professor Shapere will offer a
constructive criticism of perva-
sive contemporary concepts of sci-
entiﬁc change, analyzing parti-
cularly what constitutes scientiﬁc
revolutions.

Tonight's lecture will concen-
trate on “The Revolt Against
Positivism.” Professor Shapere
will discuss “Meanings, Methods
and Ideals‘ in the Development
of Science,” tomorrow night. The
lectures are open to the public.

crimination in housing, and poor
housing for Negroes are two of
the problems that must be solved
in the near future. The respon-
sibility for solving these prob-
lems, Katzenbach stressed, does
not lie solely with the Federal
government.

He explained that although
many housing projects are built
with Federal funds, it is the com-
munity’s responsibility to make
its people aware of how to live
in a house.

“Education is very bit as im-
portant as building houses,” the
attorney general contended. “And
as education improves, there will
be less slum area.”

If slum dwellers had been bet-
ter educated, Katzenbach main-
tained, they would not be slum
dwellers. He added that there
are tenement houses that are not
slums, and that the slum ‘came
as much from an ignorance of
good hygiene as from old houses

—perhaps even more so.

“The people of a community
have to be made to realize the
value of education in public
health and welfare,” he said. “If
people were more educated, we
wouldn’t be facing many of the
problems that we now face.”

Asked if he felt it was part
of the responsibility of the Fed-
eral government to provide this
education, Katzenboch answered,
“Yes, it is, but only if the com-
munities can't carry out the pro-
gram on their own.”

Because many integration prob-
lems have not been solved yet,
and because many people still
refuse to accept integration, the
attorney general expects further
indignities and violence this com-
ing spring and summer. But he
also expects less trouble than
during the past summer, and pre-
diets that eventually discrimina-
tion could practically disappear
—-even in the “citadel of Missis-
sippi.”

Cooley Favors Nixing
House Committee

(Continued from Page 1)

The petition states: “When
such power is directed exclusive-
ly against the rights of Ameri-
cans to free and open expression,
or association for such purposes,
it carmot be justiﬁed under any
concept of democracy.”

“A legislative body should not
be concerned with whether we
think bad thoughts or say bad
thoughts to friends, but whether
we do something bad,” Dean
Cooley said. “It is unconstitution-
al to pass statutes saying that
we can’t think bad thoughts.”

The petition also claims that
HUAC is “quite unnecessary” to
guard the internal security of
the nation because there are ade-
quate laws, regulations, person-
nel and machinery for that pur-
pose.

Traditionally the judiciary
committees have dealt with these
problems, but the petitioners)!

‘have emphasized that any powers
given to the Judiciary Committee
should be limited to investiga.
tion of overt acts such as “mu-
tiny, espionage, sabotage, insur-
rection and other overt actions
relating to internal security,”
and should not include “matters
Of Opinion, speech, association
for such purposes, or other forms
of expression.”

The petition also asks that the .

 Still Needed for Work

_ Of course, men like Putnam Jones, acting dean of the School of Liberal Arts, and
James Watson, assistant to the dean, are going to defend an undergraduate advising sys-

_ tem, that theyare responsible for.

_ We are encouraged by the fact that Watson has already taken steps to better in-
form the advisers and maketheir advising precedure more uniform. But the very fact
that student interest is so high in this area that the Student Union Board presented a
panel discussion to air the problems indicates a persisting need for re-evaluation and

correction.

Chancellor _Litchﬁeld has recognized the need for constant betterment in advising,

~ especially with the rapid rise in student quality over the past few years. We urge the

Liberal Arts deans __to consider carefully the points brought out in Friday's discussion
and never to "consider their work complete.

still others haven’t reacted
yet or just don’t giv.’e a
damn. But the fact is clear:
the University has increased
its -campus again, this time
by eight acres.

  

The University was judg- «

ed by the Department of

’Health, Education and Wel-

fare (which distributes such
land) to have the best plans
for the acreage. Some,don’t
agree, with this judgment.

Most who don’t belong to‘

the group of public insti-
tutions, who also submitted
plans when the land was
originally up for bid in
1960.

One such group is slight-
ly miffed, not because of
-what the University got, but
because of what they did not
receive. This group was in-
in the 20 - acre
launch site some distance

from the University’s al- .

lotment. They found to their
disappointment that they
did not meet certain Health,
Education and Welfare re-
quirements. As a result they

' had to pay, and pay heavily,

for a large portion of the
launch area land, whereas
the University received its
allotment free. But any
group or institution which

from all‘ forms of business]

 

the University is probably
able to find some evidence
which can justify their an-
ger. The greater percentage
of these complaints are eco-
nomic.

THE UNIVERSITY, ac-
cording to some of these in-
stitutions, is beginning to
take on the quali'ties of a
social evil, such as those
found in an Upton Sinclair
book. The worn-out phrase
“Today Oakland, tomorrow
the world,” thought up by a
local radio personality,
seems to have credability
for many, especially when
they read about property
acquisitions. But they are
wrong on two accounts. One,
that the University has de-
signs on the rest of the
globe; two, that the Uni-
versity is an economic evil.

To say that the two great-
est things to happen to Pitts-
burgh are steel and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh sounds
as though it originated in a
release from the sixth floor
of Bruce Hall. But more
and more it is becoming
true. If one looks at the
University from the econom-
ic standpoint alone, the fig-
ures involved should be
enough to silence most crit-
:«.cs.

THROUGH ITS expendi-
tures in wages and materi-
als, as well as the related
businesses which are de-
pendent upon it, the Uni-
versity is a vital part of this
area’s rather precarious
economy.

Take away the second
largest private employer in
Pittsburgh and its $51 mil-
lion a year in wages and
salaries and you take away

3&9

   

   

in this area. Take away the
40 million dollars worth of
new buildings now under
construction and you under-
mine the local buildings-ma-
terials industry, which re-
ceives 90 per cent of the
money spent on construction
supplies.

TAKE AWAY THE 250
million Oakland Corpora-
tion Research Park, which
will be both tax paying and

_proﬁt seeking, and you kill -

any chance for Pittsburgh
to become a national space
research center. With steel
actually only a shadow of
its former greatness in this
area-, something is needed

to fill the Void. Hopefully,‘

this can be done with the

The University’s educa-
tional contributions to the
community are great, but
that seldom tempers any ar-
gument against the Univers-
ity. That is unfortunate.
You cannot dissect the eco-
nomic aspect of the Univers-
sity from the educational or
vice versa. This is why
many people do not realize
the scope of the Univer-
ity’s programs, whether
they be acquisition of prop-
erty or otherwise. People
tend to criticize what they
think is blatant without con-
sidering the overall picture.
As an example the Nike
Base critics see it as anoth-
er case where the University
has trampled on smaller,
less equipped institutions.
This is false. Perhaps Pitt

did have an advantage be-’

cause of its size, but it also
has that much greater
chance to make the best pos-
sible use of the site. Be-

-cause of that, the whole
 community“ prospers-.

Coed Criticizes
Football Story

Editor, The Pitt News:

_ Once upon a time there were
two football teams. For our ex-
amples let us use the names Pitt
and Penn State. Well, every year
these two teams were ﬁred up to
play each other and every year

* statistics could be thrown to the

winds when Pitt and Penn State
clashed._

One year, for example, Pitt
was one of the top teams in the
country with only one loss. The
same year Penn State had a 7-2
record going into the game, yet
when the Lions and Panthers
met, the score was a close 22-21.

The boys on the Pitt team have
.always been ﬁred up for Penn
State. Here they have the chance
to beat some of the players
against whom they have fought
throughout high school as well as
college. _In fact, this personal
animosity makes the, ﬁght an
even more spirited one.

On Nov. 21, the Pitt Panthers
once again went to meet Penn
State, but this year things were
different. Suddenly, out of .a clear
blue sky, the Panthers decided to
let Penn State win.

After a rivalry of so many
years, the Panthers were charit-
able; or can we detect a note of
payola envolved? Maybe the Pitt
Panthers were given $1,000 each
to lose the game? Could this be
the reason behind, as Mr. Smizik
calls it, “the Pitt-attitude”?

Of course, playing football is

very easy in 19 degree weather.

with 65 m.p.h. winds, That had
nothing to do with the game at
all. It is true that Penn State
found our holes and Tom Ur-
banik drove through us. It is
true that State has a team that
has steadily improved this sea-
son. These facts, of course, have
nothing to do with our loss.

An overwhelming loss is never
as good as a win, so on this

ground we can be upset about.

our annihilation by Penn State.
But I am sure that every player
on our team goes into each and
every game with one thought on
his mind and that thought is to
WIN.

Even if .a player is on the 20th
string he still wants his team to

 

Letters To The Editor

   

rival. So before you knock Pitt
attitudes, why not interview
every player on the team? Then
you may have an accurate pic-
ture of the true Pitt attitude,
and you cannot criticize the de-
sire to WIN.
Belinda, Stein
, Liberal Arts '67

(Ed.—Mr. Smizik quoted a mem-
ber of the Pitt team saying the
Panthers were not up for the
game. As to “throwing statistics
to the winds,” Miss Stein may be
interested to know the favorites
has won five times in the last
seven meetings between the two
teams. She may also be interest-
ed in knowing that the Penn
State players also had to play
in 19 degree weather and in a 65
m.p.h. wind.)

Student Requests
CL Rest Place

Editor, The Pitt News:

If a commuting student has
holes in his schedule, Pitt offers
excellent opportunities for him
to study, eat and socialize. But
what if he has stayed up late
studying and think of nothing
more gratifying than a few hours
sleep?

Granted that some contortion-
ist with apparently no inhibitions
can accommodate themselves on
the slippery chairs and sofas in
the Student Union, but what

about the shyer, less agile stu- _

dents, who can’t sleep in public?

I would like to propose that
Pitt dedicate .a room, perhaps a
portion of the Commons Room,
to beds. Rows and rows of beds,
separated with curtains or
screens, each with a sleeping me-
ter and an alarm clock would
probably augment the Univer-
sity’s income to say nothing of
improving the students’ health.
Of course, these would be strict-
ly for commuting students. The
others can darn well walk back
to their rooms.

Miami Shooting Outshines Panthers
e»5

In Steel Bowl Final at A

Coach Timmons Calls
Guard ‘Unstoppable’

By FRANK SMIZIK

The Panthers reached the ﬁnal of the Steel
Bowl this weekend but Mia.mi’s superior shooting
was too much as the Panthers fell before the Hur-
ricanes 85-71. On Friday night in a slow-moving
and foul ridden game the Panthers defeated VPI,
74-69, after coming from a 14 point halftime
deﬁcit.

On Saturday night the Panthers stayed close to the
Hurricanes but Rick Barry on the inside and John Dam-
pier hitting from the outside they couldn’t be stopped.
“Miami’s shooting really killed _us, especially Dampier’s
long jump shots,” said coach Bob Timmons.

“Our men were dropping back to help underneath the
boards,” said Timmons, “and when Dampier started hit-
ting from outside we couldn’t do a thing.” Dampier had
18 points all on ﬁeld goals.

Timmons was equally impressed with Rick Barry un-
der the boards. “He has fantastic timing and is always
underneath the basket in the right place at the right time.
He boxes his men out and is able to get a lot of tap-ins,
however, if he has to take a longshot he has a ﬁne touch.”

Barry was named the Most Valuable Player in the
Tournament and Timmons couldn’t agree more. “He is
really smooth for a big man (six feet seven) and one of
the most complete big men in the country. In my opinion

RANGY BOB Lovette pulls down a rebound in Saturday
night’s game against --1V)Iiami of Florida. Love-tte scored
22 points.

I would rate him over Bill Br.adley of Princeton, because
of Barry’s all around play.”

Although the Hurricanes have a lot of offensive punch
they don’t play much defense. “They would stay close to
the basket and not come out to meet our men so we had
plenty of shots but we couldn’t hit,” said Timmons. “The
boys seemed to be having trouble with the baskets here.”

The statistics prove Timmons right. In the ﬁrst game
against VPI the Panthers shot only 31 per cent and
against Miami they weren't much better, shooting only

 ‘I)‘eI‘”(:'éI"1t.

DARYLE RUBY shoots among three Virginia Tech de-
fenders. The Panthers won the game, 74-69.

Timmons wasn’t dissatisﬁed with his team’s play, how-
ever. “We didn’t lose the ball to much which is very
important,” he said. “We had a bunch of sophomores and
inexperienced players out on the court and they did a
credible job. We can’t complain when we get beat by a
ﬁne team like Miami.”

One of the surprises in the tournament was the hustle
and ﬁne rebounding of Jim LaValley. In fact, LaVa11ey
started the second game at center moving Lovett to for-
ward. “Jim played a tough game under the boards and
on defense, but he’ll have to learn to shoot. He got free
a few times but missed the shots,” said Timmons.

Another sophomore Roth » 

McNauy, a guard, came on -

the bench and pleased his *

coach with his ﬁne offensive

and defensive play.’’ I ex-

pect big things from Roth,

he has a ﬁne shot and he

also played some great de-

fense tonigh "

In the Panther win over
VPI, it was persistence that
ﬁnally won out. The Pan-
thers continually plagued the
taller but slower Tech men
and forced them into mis-
takes. VPI had a tremendous
height advantage but could- -
n’t put in the rebounds.

The high scorers for the .7
Panthers were Larry Szy- 5»
kowny with 24 points against
'VJI and 17 against Miami
and Bob Levett with 19
points the ﬁrst night and 22
against the Hurricanes.
