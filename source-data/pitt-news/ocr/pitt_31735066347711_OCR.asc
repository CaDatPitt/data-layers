Injunction Curbs Nyden Rally

3, MREA CSORBA

The second sit-in in eight days on
the behalf of professors Paul Nyden
and Yusel Ali was stopped outside
Chancellor Wesley Posvar’s first
floor Cathedral office pWednesday.

The University’s legal staff
obtained a temporary injunction
beforehand to prevent the protest-
ers from occupying the administra-
tive office. ”

Common Pleas Court Judge John
Hester granted the University an
injunction against seizing buildings
and holding demonstrations inter-
fering with normal campus opera-
tions. Hester also granted the
campus police the right to remove
protesters who violated the injunc-
tion.

The injunction, according to
Legal services director William
Hannan, was directed speciﬁcally at

Penn State Unionization

the Njyden-Ali protesters and would
onlybe in operation for five days.

“We had to point out to the judge
what this group had done in the
past. Once he saw its history, he
issued the injunction. We tried to
keep things low-key and didn’t even
tell the protesters that we had the
injunction. It wasn’t like the week
before,” Hannan said.

The protest rally, sponsored by
the Student Committee to Defend
Dr. Paul Nyden, the Western
Pennsylvania Alliance Against
Racist and Political Repression and
the Black Action Society, was
conducted more peacefully than last
week’s demonstration which re-
sulted in the occupation of the
offices of the Chancellor and FAS
dean Jerome Rosenberg.

The protesters left the Chancel-
lor’s office three hours after they
had enteredit on the strength of a
trespass injunction obtained by Pitt

University Park—Pennsylvania
State University’s two-day faculty
vote on unionization for collective
bargaining ended yesterday.

Results of the election, which
featured three options,‘ the Amer-

will be tallied by late this
afternoon. _

As the polls closed yesterday, it
was reported that 93 percent of
eligible Penn State faculty mem-

cast ballots on Wednesday, the
first day of voting, according to the
student paper, The Daily Colleg-

professors will be unable to devote
the proper amount of time to
students if committed to both

honors and departmental courses

and seminars.

“Does a professor have such an
unlimited supply of energy to be
able to deal with his or her honor
students and at the same time give
equal attention to his or her
non-honor students? If this is the
case, then we ask for the rationale
behind teaching assistants and
teaching fellows,” the SG Report
stated.

The honors task force advised the
establishment of separate honors
program facilities in a central
campus location. The facilities will
include ofﬁces for staff members as
well as seminar, group study and
reading rooms and a student-faculty
lounge.

According to the SGB report,
separate facilities encouraging the
interaction of honors’ students
among themselves may result in
elitism which could lead to further
segregation and factionalism
among the student population.

“We are in agreement that the
honor student should be provided
with an enriched educational
experience and be encouraged to
study in both breadth and depth the
curricular program which he or she
chooses. However, this experience
should be provided for all students
on campus, not just a select few,”
the report said. . . A V 0

' STUDENT PROTEST
SHUTS DOWN COLLEGE
HOLLY SPRINGS, Miss.

(AP)-—In a throwback to the
turbulence of the 1960s, a ﬁre
during a student protest caused a
shutdown of a small liberal arts
college here yesterday. ’

Rust College ofﬁcials ordered all
842 students to leave the campus by
nightfall, following the ﬁre which
caused $500,000 damage to the
administration building.

A steady stream of cars left the
rural campus of the predominantly
black college throughout the day, as
students complied with the order for
what» ofﬁcials said would be a
“cooling-off period” of at least two
weeks.

Student spokesmen said the
disagreement with McMillan had
been building for several months
and prompted a three-day boycott of
classes in December. They said
many students were especially
upset because trustees had voted
Wednesday to renew McMillan’s
contract.

McMillan, 57, who has held the
post for 10 years, declined to
discuss problems which led to the
unrest. He said of the ﬁre and
school closing, “I’m sorry this had
to happen.”

Student body vice president
Charles Dawkins was arrested for
investigation of disorderly conduct
and attempting to incite a riot, but
administrators later dropped
charges on condition he return to his

A Damaging Reversal

When the American Sociological Association adopted a report
finding no substance to assistant sociology professor Paul Nyden’s
charges that Pitt’s sociology department did not renew his contract
for political reasons, a mysterious reversal took -place. Nyden, who

 

lauded the ASA when its president supported him, changed his
mind when the critical report was adopted. ,
Contradictory behavior on the part of Nyden can only serve to
- E undermine any other arguments that support his case.

Nyden contends the University is not renewing his_contract
because of political, not academic reasons. In September, an
unofficial resolution introduced by the ASA’s president at the
group’s annual meeting supported Nyden and criticized Pitt for
the way it handled his case. r

Last week, however, the ASA adopted a report that found no
substance to Nyden’s charges. It also censured its past president

, . -for his outspoken support of Nyden, claiming that he could have
jeopardized the Nyden investigation and compromised the
legitimacy of ASA’s investigation into Nyden.

Last September Nyden considered support from the ASA’s
president a “substantial victory.” He claims he doesn’t consider
last week’s decision a “substantial loss;” it won’t affect his case
because it was an “external review.”

Does ASA carry so much weight that the support of its president

;is a-substantial victory? Or is the society so unimportant that its
decisions do not affect a case such as Nyden’s?
‘Nyden should make up his mind.

A reversal like this on the part of Nyden does nothing but
‘damage the credibility of his arguments. For a man fighting
dismissal on principle, this action is indeed surprising. Similar In
tactics in the future can do nothing but cloud even the most valid
argument advanced in his behalf.

Grad Worker
Rights Ignored

Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Assistant Dean Baranger respon-
ded to the graduate employes’
collective bargaining election by

calling it a “straw poll” and saying

that it would not be recognized by
the University. Her statement
appeared to be an ignoring of the
rights of graduate employes on two
counts. _ .

One, Chancellor Posvar has said:
“If any section of the University is
confronted with the question of
unionization, the decision should be
made by that constituency. ” In this
case, of the 366 graduate employes
who voted in the collective
bargaining V election, 80 percent
(292) voted in favor of unionization.
The Dean refers to this as a straw
poll.

Second, the Internal Revenue
Service has no doubt that graduate
employes are employes. The

As a representative to the

Kenneth Quayle’ s March 30th letter
to the Pitt News concerning the

election. I am very sorrythat you
did not have an opportunity to
express your opinion on unioniza-
tion. Apparently no one in the
computer science department
thought that you had an opinion to
express or they would have
provided FAS-GSO with a list_ of
your department’s employes as was
requested.

_I participated in the election
procedure from the very beginning.
At no time did I notice anyone from
computer science exercising their
“democratic rights” or giving any
imput to this democratic procedure.
At the last FAS-GSO meeting
before the election, your depart-
ment was the only one in FAS that
had not provided a list. It was
imperative that individual depart-
ments provide these lists since the
Dean's office refused to do so. The
best that we could do, in the
absence of official lists, was to
suggest that “questionable
people” produce their appointment
letter. We did not want to be

.accused of unfair procedures.

Perhaps a better method could have
been devised. . .in fact, you or one of
your colleagues in computer science
could have suggested one if you had

UGE Outlines
E|igibility“iHunt

Kenneth ‘Casey’ Quayle, a
graduate employe in the computer
science (CS) department, has raised
the question of why he and other
graduate employes in the CS
department were not permitted to
vote in _the Graduate Student
Organization (GSO) collective bar-
gaining election of March 23-24
(Pitt News, Mar. 30). He implies in
his letter that the Union of Graduate
Employes was at fault. He is wrong.
I should like_ to set the record
straight with the following points:

1) FAS-GSO secretary David
Hess wrote to the computer science
department GSO representative on
February 7 and requested a list of
graduate employes in that depart-
ment. No list was provided.

2) FAS-GSO secretary David
Hess wrote to the chairperson of the
CS department and requested a list
of graduate employes in that
department. No list was provided.

3) FAS-GSO asked the admin-
istration of the University to provide
a list of graduate employes for the
election. No list was provided.

4) The UGE did not provide its
mailing list to GSO for the election
because our lists are unofficial. The
UGE had no way of obtaining an
official list. 7

Mr. Quayle’s conclusion, in
which he strongly hints that UGE
conspired to prevent CS graduate

employes from voting, is without ’

foundation. The fault lies with the
"CS ‘GSO representative, the chair-
person of the CS department and
the administration of the University
for failure to provide GSO with an
official list. GSO went to great.
lengths to insure that a democratic
election was held. The UGE
members campaigned in a fair and
honest fashion.

While it is unfortunate that Mr.
Quayle and one other graduate
employe in CS were denied their
right to participate in the election, it
is clear that the fault is neither

~ UGE’s or GSO’s.' Better coopera-

tion from the administration would
have prevented this incident.

Letter :
Arnjco Ad  

Attacked

“Environmentalism —— will it
muddy the job pool?” So asks that
avowed friend of clean air and pure
water, Armco Steel, in an ad placed
in the March 30 Pitt News. The
answer, according to the ad, is

' probably deﬁnitely yes.

A Armco certainly knows a lot about
muddying things up—notably the
environment-—but it is to be hoped
that no one takes the
industry’s equation of environ-

mentalism and unemployment too.

seriously.

‘Armco says America needs’ 18
million new jobs by 1985. Armco
also says that the average job costs
$42,168 to create. Armco concludes
that America can’t afford to place as
much emphasis on expensive
pollution control as environment-
alists would like. 8

But Armco doesn’t mention that
it costs $42,168 to create a job
because the only job that American
industry is willing to create is one
that necessitates a man to run a
machine—-in other words, a capital-

’ intensive, energy-intensive job.

Armco doesn’t mention that it could
create a labor-intensive, probably
much less dehumanizing job for
quiet a bit less money. Armco
doesn’t mention it because labor-
intensive jobs are deﬁnitely not
profit-intensive and Armco doesn’t
really care about those 18 million
job-seekers as much as it cares
about proﬁts.

I think we could view industry’s

sob stories about environmentalism
much less critically if companies
like Armco would demonstrate an

i honest commitment to serving the

body~'public—by creating a few
labor-intensive jobs while unem-
ployment is such a big problem, for
instance. Instead, we get drivelling
ads that claim massive, although
indirect, social beneﬁt from cor»
porate profitability-and large
scale layoffs every time proﬁts are
threatened.

Unless major changes in cor-
porate attitudes come, let's hope
the environmentalists’ keep the
pressure on our ﬁnger-wagging
industrialists, lest they ‘choke us
before they render -us obsolete. .

have been unfortunate enough to do
their graduate work in the late ’60s
when a number of others actually
tended to believe the university was
the proper place for voicing
dissenting opinion, raising fund-
amental questions and taking
action, but that sort of person has
now been safely “terminated”—
even at Harvard. Somehow we
seem to have a small resistant strain
of the “unconverted” who tena-
ciously cling to some ideals that
never really existed here or
anywhere for very long. Such
naivete is really incomprehensible
and, I suppose, unforgiveable. I

..imagine the art and history

professors of last year did the
“proper” thing andleft quietly.
We are not supposed to take the
guidelines for promotion and tenure
all that seriously, for the real basis
for promotion and tenure ‘are
unwritten, but generally known.
One does not really have to publish
very much, or at all. I can cite a
number of recent promotions I know
of where it was not a case of quality
of publications, for these particular
professors published nothing-
nothing at all. And it is not a

question of quality of teaching, for" .

some of these same professors not
only had no. evaluations of their
teaching ability but in two instances
unblemished reputations as the
worst teachers in their school. In
fact, excellence in teaching is one of
the most grevious faults to include
in one’s promotion papers.

Community service is not to be
confused with service to the
community but is deﬁned by sitting
“on committees. Now here is where
promotion begins. It is not
necessary that the committee
accomplish anything—most don't
—but that its meetings be long, its
members inform‘ everybody how
hard they work and that it submits
lengthy reports. V The real
evaluations take place ‘here, on the
17th ﬂoor of the Cathedral and the
Faculty Club—sometimes in
departmental meetings. The
credentials presented in these
places are intended to certify
safeness, that the professor is a
‘ ‘nice guy,’ ’ difﬁcult for the women,
which is probably why so many are
involved in court actions with the
University. ‘

Now the ﬁrst rule is that an
avowed Marxist cannot be a nice
'guy—especially if he/ she is an
activist on top of it—especia1ly
sitting with a group -of avowed

capitalists who have mortgages and
tenure. Even at B_erkeley——good

old “radical” Berkeley——.a black

professor—Harry Edwards-is
being denied tenure. He virtually
created the sociology of sports,
draws 900 students to his class
each quarter, his textbook is used
in 150 colleges and he has a long
list of published articles. He did, of
course, break all the real rules for
promotion and tenure and is paying
the price.

I don't happen to be a Marxist but
it would seem logical that since a
majority of the world’s people live
under some form of Marxist
ideology, a university cannot be
ﬁrst-rate without a Marxist on the
departments of sociology, history
and economics. But of course we‘
are not ﬁrst-rate by any of the
published national rankings—with
a few exceptions of a department
here or there. And we will not
become ﬁrst-rate, for we are
desperately trying to be third-rate
and will, I am certain, succeed.

Of course no one is going to give
tenure or promote a professor who
is a‘ threat to them, especially if the
professor is academically superior
or so different in her/ his orientation
that the basic structure of the
discipline is threatened. Blacks,

women and Marxists have a similar

problem. They feel‘ they can simply

present their credentials and they

will be fairly and objectively judged.

This is not true anywhere-—

Washington, business or\ the

university. It is a fundamental fact

here at Pitt and Nyden, Ali,
Johnson, etc., etc., etc., should
have learned right off.

Certainly it is disillusioning and
disappointing for many of us who

expected the academic life to be ’

exciting, challenging, a clash of
ideas where there was room and
acceptance. for a wide variety of
ideas and very different kinds of
people. Well, it isn't so. Rather, it
is merely an extension of the
pettiness, power plays, game
playing, deceptions and flattery of
the larger society. The “uncon-
verted” who continue to cling to the
ideal in the face of this reality will
pay the price. Their loss effects all
of us and adds to the continual
errosion of that ideal academic
community which, in the seventies,
as far asl can determine, no longer
exists anywhere. ‘

However, the letters section is a

And it is this that leads to occasional

nothing on which to vent my
annoyance, no scapegoat to blame.

Really annoyed. Because I have
met many turkeys like Mulholland
before and have come to understand
the gallinaceous psychological cy-
bernetic sufficiently to predict with
assurance that if old Joe McCarthy
himself were to fly up from where he
is now, appear before Mulholland
and personally order him to shove
it, the latter would leap up off his
knees in a twinkling and denounce
old Joe as a dirty pinko communist
ratfudger. And what old Joe cannot
do, none of these letters-to-th.e—edi-
tor can do. A

On the other hand, I understand
these letter-writers, too. They do
not mean to mislead me into reading
about Mulholland; rather they
earnestly attempt to debate the
issues with him in the hope that
some good may issue from the
attempt. Let them write on!
Sooner or later they will realize that
all this quixotic jousting with
windbags matters little and will
then stop.

What can we do in the meantime?
Ideally, everything written by, for
and about Mulholland should be
required to strike the ground with a
stick and cry, “Uncleanl Unclean!”
at the reader’s approach. But ideal
solutions are inordinately difficult
to implement. Thus I suggest that
from now on, anything written for

Pitt News preceded and terminated
by an easily recognizable logo that
will warn selective readers to keep

be a singularly appropriate logo for
this. And for the journalistic edsels
that he faithfully churns out every

seems eminently apt, wouldn’t you
say?

In fact, you can begin this early-

Pitt Panther Keith Nixon doesn’t
mind people thinking that_ he’s

, weird or that he’s not playing with a

full deck because of his desire to

.dress up as Pitt’s mascot for the

football and basketball games. In
fact, Nixon doesn’t mind at all if
people think he’s crazy and laugh at
him, for if they do, he’s doing his job
successfully.

Nixon, a junior economics major,
is the brother of last year’s Panther,
Don Nixon, stepping into the
position after ﬁlling in for his
brother on a number of occasions.

“He’s more or less responsible

Panther Mascot Nixonll   

for giving me the opportunity,”
Nixon said, “but through ﬁlling in
for him I learned how crazy it was
and how fun it was to do.

“Basically, I just try to make
people laugh and I act like a clown in
front of them,” the 6-0, 167—pound
Nixon said. “I’m not really like
that, but it gives me a chance to get
rowdy and do stupid things that if I
did them outside of the suit they‘d
lock me up—certain things that you
wouldn’t ordinarily do. But just
being a part of it is just great.”

Besides the ability to clown
around, being the mascot involves
using the art of gymnastics to a
large degree, especially in using the
mini-trampoline in executing air-
borne somersaults. Nixon gained
his gymnastics experience at Peters
Township High School near Wash-
ington, Pa., where he earned four
letters in one of that school’s most’
popular and successful sports.

But his gymnastics career ended
soon after his arrival at Pitt due to
aggravated tendons in his ankles.
“The pain got so bad I used to get
cortisone shots,” Nixon related. He
subsequently gave up gymnastics to
avoid undergoing surgery to correct
the problem.

Though he is very coricerned
about remaining anonymous (f‘I’d
like to remain anonymous until I’m
through doing it,” he said. “I’m
not a glory-seeker; ljust don't want
to be known.”) Nixon at least
returned to the limelight and
excitement of sports by inheriting
the Panther position. He has no
trouble now with hs ankles, but
other adversities are numerous.

“When I’m in that suit and
running around I’m soaking wet,”
he said, “but I don’t really feel hot
because I move around so much.

First casualty of the yet-to-begin Pitt football season is none other than Panther
mascot Keith Nixon, whohas lost a little more than his balance.

sweatshirt. In basketball, I'm hot
because I can't move around as
much.”

Rival crowds pose a major
problem for anyone who serves as
the Pitt mascot. Two years ago in
Morgantown, W. Va., Keith's
brother had to run for his life after
West Virginia’s winning ﬁeld goal
sailed through the uprights in the
ﬁnal seconds. Even the home
crowds pick on Nixon—when they
pass him around the stands, for
instance—but that’s all in fun.

“At the last basketball game
down at the Civic Arena versus
Duquesne, ” Nixon said, ‘ ‘I was just
being a turkey, like normal. I was
sitting on a felding chair and fell
backwards and the Duquesne
students started calling me “stu—
pid” and other names—they didn’t
know I did it on purpose.”

Though Nixon said of the West
Virginia mascot, the Mountaineer,
“I’ve heard he’s big turkey; I just
stay away from him,” he gets along
with such rival mascots as the Notre
Dame Leprechaun, the Duke Blue
Devil and the Temple Owl. Nixon
also relates with the rival cheer-
leaders, though they may not think
so. .

“I stole a Miami cheerleader,”
he said proudly. “She was
screaming and saying, ‘Let me
down’ the whole way as I carried her
around the track. I don’t think she
knew what in the world I was going
to do.”

But Nixon's biggest test ‘came
during halftime of a basketball
game this past season at the Field
House when he wrestled Victor, the
700-pound bear. Despite being

Have you heard the one about
the wino who sells his blood to buy

That’s what worries Tom Wacker,
manager at Sera-Tec Biologicals on
Forbes Avenue.

Sera-Tec pays blood donors and
sells the plasma to many pharma-
ceutical houses and a few hospitals.

According to Wacker, paid donor
establishments usually receive
unwarranted, adverse publicity. He
said the idea of selling blood seems
wrong to some people.

. “The large number of .Pitt
students who donate here are
probably not aware that they do a
tremendous ‘service for the com-
munity,” Wacker said.

“Donors who contribute twice a

for the time, not their plasma.”

muzzled and declawed, Victor had
an easy time with his presumed arch
enemy, the Panther.

“He still had all his strength
though,” Nixon said of the attempt
at equalizing the bout. “I went in
and got on his back and he threw me
down on my knees?‘ I tried to throw
him down and he hit me. That’s
when he gave me the fat lip through
the helmet.

“That thing really smelled,” he
continued, “but I’m trying to get to
do that again next year. I wanted to

' - . see how well I could do with it.

Someday I’d like to wrestle an
orangatang.”

Nixon calls that experience the
most fun so far in his career and one
of his methods of revitalizing the
position, a process which. he said
began last year when his brother
was the Panther.

“It’s unique,” he said. “We’ve
more or less been changing the
image of the Panther by not

I standing around, but doing corny
stuff and getting people to laugh.
We’re just more or less clowns.”

When the Panthers scored a’

touchdown or a ﬁeld goal, Nixon hit
the turf for push-ups, doing them
cumulatively, of course, with the
number of push-ups reaching

 

astronomical totals.

“It gets a little difficult,” he
explained. “Like at Navy, it was
42-0 and I got a little tired——like my
chest and arms were going to fall
off.”

Nixon thinks of himself as a
one-man show beside the football
ﬁeld or basketball court and takes
great satisfaction in what he does
despite wishing to remain anony-
mous as far as his real face is
concerned. ’

“I practice with the cheerleaders
and try to participate in what they
do slightly,” he explained, “but
most ofthetime I’m on my own. I’m
not known very well as a celebrity,
but basically it's just having fun. It
keeps me busy and just being part of
it all is great.

“The little kids are usually pretty
nice,” he continued. “They come
up to me for an autographed picture
and I just eat that up. But I’d rather
be a thing than people knowing me
as a person when I’m out there.”

Besides sporting‘ events, Nixon
also attends such events as the
Chancellor's receptions. pep ral-
lies, Golden Panther brunches on
Saturday mornings during football
season and visits hospitals. He has
also tried his hand at portraying
Pirate Pete, a position his brother

Chekov’s ’ Three Sisters’ Triumphs at Studio

Studio Theatre.

By JOAN GUBERNICK

The Three“ Sisters
Studio Theatre
Directed by. Donald Eisen

Like dynamite with a long fuse,
“The Three Sisters,” Chekhov’s
drama in four acts, exploded into an
excellent Studio Theatre production
Wednesday night.

' Professionally directed by Donald

P Eisen and performed by an

extremely able cast, “The Three
Sisters” played on every emotion
and drew tears by its end.

The Prozorov~sisters are bored.
They are unhappy, they are
unfulﬁlled. Stuck in a small Russian
peasant province, the three women
cling to a dream of when they can

By KEITH BRIAN

Imagine, if you can, a forty-year-
old musician standing more than six
feet tall, wearing pointed cowboy
boots and chewing Beechnut
chewing tobacco. His massive body
is topped off with a felt stetson that
is elipsed with a pheasant-feather
hat band. And then, imagine
meeting and talking with such a
man, Charlie Daniels.

The Charlie Daniels Band arrived
at the Marriott Inn at 1:30 p.m; It
was to perform that night at the
sold-out Stanley Theatre at 8:00
p.m. with upcoming talent LAW
and the more established Atlanta
Rhythm Section.

Daniels played in a “country
rock” or “southern rock” style, but
as he put it, “I haven’t heard an

V accurate adjective to describe our

)7

music. The corpulent songwriter
went on to say, “They can supply
the adjectives, I’ll supply the
music.”

Daniels, who first picked up a
guitar 25 years ago, picked one up
again March 29 and proceeded to
display what a quarter-century of
practice can do with such songs as;
“Long way back to Vicksburg,”
“Birmingham Blues,” “Saddle
Tramp” and “Long Haired Country
Boy.” »

The lyrics are pure and powerful;
no wasted words. “I don’t ask for
much of nothing, if I can’t get it on

my own...” comes from "Long V

Haired Country Boy.” Daniels’
inﬂuences vary "from reading the
books of Louis Lamour (who has had
more than 30 books made into films)
and the paintings of Western artists
such as Remington and James
Bama, to “I don’t know...it just
comes to me.”

The talent on the band is by no
means limited to Daniels. Joel
DiGrigorio is a ﬁne pianist‘ whose
pleading vocals blend well in the
tune “Oh Mississippi.” The use of
two lead guitarists is by no means
original, but with two excellent
pickers such as those possessed by
C.D.B. it is a pleasure to listen to.

“The Three Sisters,” a play by Anton Chekov, opened Wednesday night at the
Bob Gehlbach, Jocelyn Johnson, and Joseph Passarello
portray three of the leading roles in the production.

he met his death. Moscow-Olga,

‘ Irina and Masha’s last chance for an

escape from the mundane lives they
have built for themselves.

Olga, the eldest, is a gentle and
sensitive school teacher with so
much love to share and no one to
share it with. She realizes she is
getting older with each passing day
and tells her sisters that she'd
marry anyone who ‘asked her, as
long as she respected him, that love
didn’t matter anymore.

Irina, the youngest, is beautiful
and childlike. She was loved by
many men but found herself unable

“I’d like to see the boys get a
break and start off on their own
some day,” Daniels said of the rest
of his band. One of those boys is the
other guitarist, Barry Barnes, who
did much more than hold up his end.
On “Cumberland Mountain No. 9”
he did all the guitar work and a
majority of the vocals:

Daniels, a 1955 graduate of
Goldstone High in North Carolina,
grew up listening to Flatt &
Scruggs, then Elvis, and now
enjoys Marshall Tucker, a band he
has appeared with all over the
country. There is a feeling from
each of these bands in his songs.

The music is strong but it never
drowns out the lyric. “We’re a sit-
back-and-listen-to type of band.”
Daniels said. But try to tell that to
the 3,800-plus dancing in the aisles
to the powerful ‘ ‘The South’s Gonna
do itl” and its lyrics, “be proud to
be a rebel, ‘cause the South’s gonna
do it again.”

Charlie’ls ambitions are “for
every album to be platinum and for
every concert to be a sellout.” His
next album is due in September. He
played the title track, “Whiskey,”

and if the rest of the album is .

anything like the title cut he won’t
have any trouble reaching his goal
for the record.

As the concert’s closing drew
nigh, the band came out for its
second encore. It had to be drawing
its energy from the crowd; after

to give any love back. She was
unfulilled by her work and
frustrated by her inability to feel
true love. Irina was a victim of a
blase existence. A

Moody and hot tempered, Mash
Prozorov, the middle sister, was
locked in a marriage that had her
totally revolted and married to a
man she couldn’t bear to be in the
same room with. She attempted an
ill-fated love affair with a married
army ofﬁcer and as a consequence
almost lost her mind.

The play opens with the three
sisters reminiscing about the past
and dreaming of happier tomorrows
awaiting them in Moscow, if only
they could make do with their
present day situation just a little
while longer. Characters ﬁlter in
and out of their lives-—lovers,
ﬁances, friends, even a brother who
gave up any right to his dreams
after he marries a shrewish woman
from their town. ,

These characters all stay for a
time—but by the end of the play the

three sisters are alone, drawing on
each other for the strength enough
to realize that their dreams are
futile and they will never break out
of their hopeless situation.

“The Three Sisters” is lengthy
but Eisen manages to keep
audience contact throughout. One
felt caught in the quicksand of the
Prozorov women’s lives. There was
never a letdown in the three and a
half hours spent in the theatre.

Chekhov, as a playwright, builds
his work to a gradual climax,
unwinding a complicated plot,
assuming off-stage actions while
focusing on emotions within. Eisen
captured the audience and this
reviewer; one waited anxiously for
the next act to unfold.

The leading roles were ﬁlled by
three talented women. Nardi Novak
gave us a tender, wistful’ai_id gentle
portrayal of the aging Olga; Pat
Wade Robbins was seen as the
charming, captivating and naive
Irina and Jocelyn Johnson gave a
quick-tempered, moody Masha,

jolting us with her ﬁne outbursts of
emotion. Johnson’s facial expres-
sions and strong voice constructed
an excellent performance, which
she has done consistantly in past
Pitt productions.

Edwin -Gur as the henpecked
brother and Debra Lynn Gordon as
his shrewish wife added personal
touches to the interpretations of
their characters. He, the pictured
henpecked husband forever push-
ing that baby carriage around; she
is the domineering woman, striding
around the stage, always in a rush,
her skirts rustling about her. ‘ It
made one cringe inside every time
those starched petticoats were
heard.

Stan Finegold, fine as Masha’s
dull but well meaning husband, and
Joseph N. Passarello, Masha’s

lover with problems of his own, A-

executed two ﬁne and strong
performances.

“Cosi is about two young, naive
fellows who have an older, wiser
friend who bets them that their
fiaiicees, such paragons of virtue as
they are, would dump them if given
the chance. The rest ofthe opera is
devoted to the episodes of the
couples as they try to best each
other. Of course it all turns out fine
in the end. ’

A pleasant surprise came about
when the audience discovered last
night.’ s version was in English. This
particular cast worked well with
each other in dramatics and timing.

Johanna Meier as Fiordiligi stood
above the others in the cast for vocal
talent and characterization. She
didn’t have many funny moments
but she played the haughty, proper
society woman and didn’t need
many laughs to get her message
across.

Mildred Miller, otherwise known
as Mrs. Wesley Posvar, had an
overabundance of talent in the
dramatic ﬁeld. She had trouble with
some of the vocals but she still has a
good top range. The real treat was
watching her clown. around on

stage, hopefully she will be cast in
more of these parts in the future.

John Stewart as Fernando lived
up to the legendary tenor role with
statuesque physical appearance
and the voice to match his classic
style. His aria “My Love is a
Flower” was poignant and tender.
His manner balanced that of Meier.

Jake Gardner as Guglielmo
complemented the ensemble per-
fectly. His solo “You Lovely
Women” was a spoof on all
gentlemen of the 18th century and
he carried it off with a typical tongue
in cheek attitude.

Gwenlynn Little as the maid and
general troublemaker gave the best
comedic performance as well as a
strong backup for the ensembles
and a few good arias of her own
(“Do Unto Men What They Do Unto
You”). Her disguises were
hilariousand the voice changes she
adapted for them added to the
humorous element.

Mozart collaborated with his
favorite librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte
for “Cosi”. Mozart’s musical
genius extended itself to many
forms. Some claim his operas are
the best ever written, even before
those of Verdi, Puccini and Rossini
and Wagner. “Cosi’f was written in

1789 and Mozart, one of music’s_

biggest contributors was buried in a
pauper’s grave two years later.

Tracksters RevUp

By DAVE McDONALD

The Pitt track team opens its

. outdoor season this weekend at

William & Mary minus a few young,
key performers. Not making the
trip to Williamsburg will be
freshmen sprinters Bud Cooper and

Larry Shippen, out with ankle '

injuries, Mark Studnicki, out with
the ﬂu,_ and sophomore Eric
Drescher, out at Duke University
where he has taken a position on the
Blue Devil football team.

However, coach Mike Agostinella
believes the remaining members
can pick up the slack and ﬁnish
respectably at the Colonial Relays
this weekend.

“I believe our sprinters will be
right up there with the southern
teams which are specialists in the
short sprints,” he said.

Making up the Panther’s 440-and
mile-relays are Willie Walker, Dan
Schuerle, Keith Leckenby and
Kevin Carpenter. In the sprint

. medley relay Walker, Leckenby and

Carpenter will be joined by Rich
Moore, who will also anchor the
half-mile relay.

Dan Goodyear and Keith Taylor
will be leaping towards seven-plus
feet this weekend in the high jump,
while Taylor will also compete in the
triple jump. Jim Chapin, Jim
Munier and Mike Wallace will be
heaving» the hammer and Munier
and Wallace will also come back on
Saturday to put the shot.

 The Colonial Relays will host a

variety of distance events and the
Panthers will be well represented.
On Friday, two freshmen, Dan

Dattilo and Gary Siriano, Will
compete in the freshrnen 1,500-
meter even't. Siriano, out with a leg
injury’ since fall, remains question-
able, but Agostinella sees it
differently.

“Gary has really been perform-
ing well in practice, despite the fact
that he was away from running,”
Agostinella said. “I believe he will
run agutsy race.” .

Even though this is a new race to
Dattilo, Agostinella believes he,
too, will hold his own. ,

“Dan has been getting in extra
miles and this extra work will be

beneﬁcial to him in this race,” the
Pitt coach stated.
Two sophomores will be running

V new events this weekend with Bob

Lee competing in the l0,000-meter

- - race and most improved runner of

the indoor season, Ron Wirick, will
try the steeplechase event.

In the 5,000-meter run, most
valuable runner from indoor
season, Mel Boyd, and Nort
McDonald will compete against
experienced runners from teams
such as Penn State, Georgetown
and the host team, Wil1iam’& Mary.

» The ﬁnal distance event of the day
will be the four-mile relay, with Pitt
being represented by Tom Herr-
mann, Tom Fitzgerald, Siriano and
McDonald.

If Pitt can do as well in the
outdoor season as they did in the
indoor season (3-1 record), then this

» season’s opener at Williamsburg
could be the start of a new
revolution for the Panther track
team.

‘ " M Promises , Promises :
‘Hockey Arena

* By STEVE SYBERT

Politicians are famous for their unfulﬁlled promises, especially after
promising the world during a tight election race. Once in office, they
promise even more to keep a high image. They promise mostly to those
in need, but the words seem to disappear. Promises, promises.

Pitt athletic director Casimir Myslinski would make a great politician-
In February of 1973, he was quoted as saying of the athletic program at
the University, “Our only purpose is to build a program to the point
where it can bring in enough money for a better overall program. We
don’t want to cut sports, in fact, I’d like to add hockey, but it will all 1
depend on how much money we have.”

Hockey, ah yes, that ﬂoundering soul seemingly destined to years of
wanderin g, in search of a home—-one that would provide the funding for a
quality program that team members have worked so hard to achieve.
Over four years have ticked away since Myslinski expressed his want of a ,
hockey team at Pitt, but the hockey players on campus are still organized
as just a club with only meager funds (though: thanks to Student
Government they are adequate) with which to work. So much for

promises.
The overall sports program at Pitt

(compared to others at universities

of similar size) stinks. Except for Trees Hall and the astro-turfed Pitt

Stadium, the facilities are deﬁnitely

lacking——most avid tennis players

have more spare rackets than there are tennis courts and the Field
House surely must have been mistaken for an airplane hanger by many

an unknowing pilot.

  Another Yank Dynasty ?

, a By RICH HARRY

It’ll take nothing less than a
miracle on the part of the Cleveland

‘Indians and Boston Red Sox to

unseat the New York Yankees this
year as top dog in the American

~ ‘League East.

Unfortunately, Cleveland lacks
the hitting and Boston the pitching
to topple New York, which is
threatening a dynasty as domin-
ating as any of its predecessors.

In Baltimore, a rebuilding
program is the order of the day as
the Orioles were severely crippled
by the re-entry draft and will most
likely end up somewhere in the
middle of the pack as a result.

NEW YORK YANKEES
Even before the Yanks signed

free agents Reggie Jackson and
Don Gullet, this was the team most

experts picked to steamrool its way

to a second consecutive division
And rightly so.

Add superstar Jackson (27 home
runs. 91 RBI, .277) to a lineup that
already includes the league's Most

.‘.Valuable Player, Thurman Mun-

son; the league's home run champ

C(32), Graig Nettles; the league's

leader in runs scored (104), Roy
White; and other notables like
Mickey Rivers (.312) and Chris
Chambliss (17 HR, 96 RBI, .293).
and you have an offense of
awesome proportions.

Then insert Gullet (11-3, 3.00
ERA with Cincinnati last year) into
a rotation withvl9-game winner Ed

‘Figueroa, 17-game winners Catﬁsh

Hunter and Dock Ellis and 14-game
and you
may possibly have the best staff in
the majors.

In the bullpen, the Yanks have
two legitimate aces——Sparky Lyle
and Dick Tidrow. The pair put out
the fire 47 times last year.

The only weakness in the team is
shortstop where Fred Stanley

 ‘carries an anemic stick. And that

situation may change if Mickey
Klutts is as good as most D€‘<)Dl€‘

believe he is. Klutts hit .319 and
hit 24 homers in the minors a year
ago, and will pose a serious threat
to-Stanley's regular status.
Whoever plays short will have
one of the ﬁnest young inﬁelders in
the game as his keystone mate-—
Willie Randolph. Randolph, a
rookie last season, hit a respectable
.267 and was brilliant in the ﬁeld.
The Yanks will be devastating.

CLEVELAND INDIANS

The Tribe has come a long way
under the tutelage of manager
Frank Robinson and general
manager Phil Seghi. Through a
series of trades that have panned
out favorable in their favor and an
inﬂux of youth from the farm
system, the Indians have ﬁnally
emerged from the doldrums of the
early '70s. _

The reason for optimism is the
signing of free agent Wayne
Garland. a 20-game winner at
Baltimore, who is counted on to
anchor an already impressive
group of starting ihurlers. providing

Robinson with one of the best staffs

in the league.

Include in the rotation with
Garland will be Pat Dobson, Jim
Bibby. young Dennis Eckersley and
Al Fitzmorris. obtained from
Toronto. All four performers
chalked up wins in double figures
last season, with Dobson and
Fitzmorris totalling 16 and 15
victories. respectively.

Robinson will have some prob-
lems with his offense. The Indians
traded their top power hitter,
George Hendrick (25 homers). to
the San Diego Padres in return for

singles hitter Johnny Grubb,

last season. j

The rest of the lineup is
populated by some good hitters
such as third baseman Buddy Bell
(.281), centerﬁelder Rick Manning

(.292) and catcher Ray Fosse
(.301). The keystone combo of
Frank Duffy and Duane Kuiper are
known better for their defensive
prowess than their bats.

Cleveland is good, but not good

enough.
BOSTON RED SOX

Will age ﬁnally catch up with
Ca-rl Yastremski and Luis‘Tiant?

Will Bill Lee bounce back from
an injury-plagued year?

Will Bill Campbell prove his
miraculous relief stints last season
were not flukes?

And will George Scott ﬁnd
happiness in his return to Boston?

These are the key questions
facing Red Sox manager Don
Zimmer this season, questions
whose answers will ultimately
decide his team's fate.

If the 36-year-old Tiant comes to
contract terms and duplicates last
‘season's total of 21 victories and
lefty Lee returns to pre-1976 form,
the Bosox will have a respectable
starting rotation. *Without those
two, however, the Sox have
headaches. Complimenting them
in the rotation will be Fergie
Jenkins, Rick Wise and Reggie
Cleveland.

Campbell, secured as a free
agent, was the best ﬁreman in the
league a year ago. appearing in 78
games with Minnesota while
saving 20 and picking up 17 wins.

Graybeard Yastrzemski, 37,
enjoyed a ﬁne 1976 season with 102
RBI and 21 homers and will be used
primarily as designated hitter.

That leaves George Scott.

So maybe it’s too far out of the

Perhaps Myslinski has forgotten his.
interview with Greg Benedetti (then

the WIIC-TV color commentator on

hockey telecasts) in November of

, 1974, when he said—Pitt did not have

a varsity hockey team because it had
no rink on campus and that the
building of a rink, perhaps as part of

a new sports complex, was ﬁve years away. Three years down, two to

go.

In early 1975, the Hockey Club polled 38 colleges and universities ,

which participated in hockey programs of one sort or another. ' The
replies showed 33 hockey programs receiving the bulk of their funds
from their respective athletic departments, while 21 schools owned or

’ had access to their own rinks.

A second survey polled 169

I schools with the results as follows:

of the 44 questionnaires returned,
30 showed a rink on campus, while
14 other hockey programs rented
nearby rinks (as is the situation
currently at Pitt). The survey also
showed attendance ranging from a
low average of 150 per game to a
high of 8,600 per game with the
NCAA champion Wisconsin Bad-
gers, whose hockey program rivals
football. Other notable attendance

ﬁgures received were St. Louis ‘=

University——7,500;Denver—4,500;
Colorado
Dame and Western Michigan-—
4,000; and Yale—3,500.

CASIMIR MYVSLINSKI

Not all successful hockey programs belong to Canadian border or New
England colleges as Myslinski supposed in the interview with Benedetti.
According to the surveys, the average attendance for collegiate hockey

hovers around 2,000 per game. The

teams practice from one and a half__

four hours per day and schedule from ﬁve to 22 home games‘pe.r year.
The key to hockey. success at Pitt lies in the building of a rink, one that
could be used for public skating and lessons.as well as other activities

when the ice is thawed.

Will the promise be fulﬁlled or tabled by the politicians?

BALTIMORE ORIOLES

The Orioles are in trouble.
Reggie Jackson, Wayne Garland
and Bobby Grich have gone for
more favorable environments.
Brooks Robinson and Mike Cuellar
are memories. And what's left is a
team with more holes than
manager Earl Weaver can be
expected to adequately fill.

Returning to the lineup are
first baseman Lee May and his
powerful bat (25 HR, 108 RBI, a
league high), underrated Ken
Singleton in rightfield, defensive
stalwart Mark Belanger "at short-
stop and Al Bumbry in center.

In his best move to rectify the
loss of Grich and the decline of
Robinson, Weaver can move Doug
Decinces from third to short.
clearing the way for Richard Dauer,
a .336 hitter in the minors last
season, to move in at the hot
corner.

Fighting for the leftfield spot will
be speedsters Pat Kelly and Elliot
Maddox, both obtained in off-
season trades. If Maddox can
recover from leg. troubles, his
presense in the lineup will be a shot
in the arm for the Orioles. He was
a. .300 hitter for the Yankees a
couple of seasons ago.

’ Weaver has only two reliable
starting pitchers, but one of them is
tops in the league. He's Jim
Palmer, who beat the opposition 22
times last year while registering a

. spectacular

2.51 ERA en route to the Cy Young
Award. He must be rated a good
bet to repeat the honor.

But after Palmer the talent drops
considerably. Rudy May won 15
last season, but that was when the
Birds provided more run support
than can be expected this season.
Ross Grimsley will follow in the
rotation but he is plagued by a
bloated ERA (3.94) and a tendency

to allow too many home run balls. '

The Orioles are flying in the
wrong direction.

DETROIT TlGERS

Last ‘year Mark “The Bird"
Fidrych set the baseball world on
its ear with his eccentrics and
pitching, and this
season the Tigers may again have
the majorls best rookie in their
midst, power hitting‘ Steve Kemp.

Kemp, only 22, cracked '19
homers last season while blistering
the ball at a .386 clip at the Tigers’
Evansville affiliate. He's labled
“can’t miss" and will be handed
the left field assignment.

Kemp will h.ave good company in
the garden. Ron Leflore is one of
the better centerfielders in the

circuit, hitting .316 last yearwhile...

swiping 58 bases. Flanking Leflore
in right will be Rusty Staub, the
Bengal’s main run producer with
96 RBI, 15 roundtrippers and a

p.299 batting mark.

The infield stacks up with
sophomore Jason Thompson at
first, veteran Tito Fuentes at
second, Tom Veryzer his keystone
mate and Aurelio Rodriguez at
third. None are standouts .with
the bat, although Thompson's
team-leading 17 home runs may be
a portent of better things to come.

MILWAUKEE BREWERS

The Brewers finished dead last
in the division last season and the?
expansion Toronto Blue Jays are
the only barrier keeping them from
repeating the dubious distinction
this year.

Despite the gloomy picture, the

Brewers did pull off a couple of“

good trades that will help them in
the long run. First they swapped
catcher Darrell Porter and. hurler
Jim Colburn to Kansas City for
tlychasers Jamie Quirk and Jim
Wholford, then sent first baseman

George Scott and reserve Bernie
Carbo to Boston for first baseman \ ‘

Cecil Cooper, a player yet to
perform up to his potential. ~
Nevertheless, the changes are
for the better. Manager Alex._
Grammas’ new lineup consists 

vOakland refugee Sal Bando at

third, Robin Yount at short, Tim
Johnson at second and Cooper
replacing Scott at first.
Catcher Charlie Moore hit only
.191, but is young enough to
improve.

“Milwaukee's finest" does not 

mean its baseball team.
TORONTO BLUE JAYS

Toronto, Canada’s second entry’

to the big time, has all the
earmarks of an expansion team:
ancient hurlers hoping for a last
chance, utility infielders and a
staggering amount of personnel
unfamiliar to even the most astute
baseball observer.

Bob Bailor or

In the outfield, John Lowenstein
