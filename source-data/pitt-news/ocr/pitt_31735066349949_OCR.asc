 Administrators Wary

by DENNY KLEPPICK
- Suggestions for registration re-

form have been proposed by Lee '

Clabots, a student who worked

. for theRegistrar during the sum-

mer.

2., Clabots suggested that the Reg-
istration Office be provided with

a small computer system of its.
own which would be capable of

' producing an invoice immediate-

V ly upon registration.

A The ‘Data Center not only pro-

ﬁcesses all invoices but adminis-

ters the_business functions of the

....personnel processing, and pre-

pares reports for various state

The basis of Clabots' proposal
is contained in an unpublished re-
port prepared by a systems ana-
lyst for the Data Center. The re-

ration Refo

  
  

port, according to Clabotsi recom-
mends the implementation of an
immediate invoicing concept.
Such a system could be achieved
by the installation in__theCregis-
tration office of a'small com-
puter or a satellite system of ter-
minals connected with_the exist-
ing computers. I , ’

According to Clabots. such a
system would “save the students

weeks of waiting for his invoice v

only to find errors." .
Registration is presently a_three

-stage process. ‘The student regis- '

ters at the Registrars Office,
where he can also institute-add-
drops, address changes, and name
corrections.

The information is sent to the
Data Center where it is processed
and fed into the computer.

At this point. the Comptroller
is responsible for assessing fees
and tuition costs.

The invoice is then processed
and mailed with various bro-
chures_ and information to the stu-
dent. According to-Dr. Richard
Allshouse, Registrar, this pack-
age costs “a minimum of 18 cents,
and usually around 24 cents to
mail.

Allshouse pointed out that pre-
vious student proposals have re-
sulted in changes in the registra-

tion system. “The process of reg- 3‘

istering by class. senior, junior.
and so on, was the result of a pro-
posal by the Student Govern-
ment." he stated, -

at-oLot Operator Denies

i  "Commuter Charges

by BOB GEDEKOH

Parking lot operator John Kat-

.0 sur has denied charges made by
3 Commuter Association members

who. claimed that Katsur's park-
mg rates for Pitt games are ex-
cessively high and that one car
had been stuck in a muddy area
of one of his lots.

or The car. said Katsur. was stuck

. in an area not designated for park-

‘ ping and which bordered on a neigh-

bor‘s property. He stated that
there was no need to park there
because the lot is not being used

- to capacity and space was avail-

able elsewhere.

Katsur added that adequate di-
rection is given to lot patrons.
noting that he is there almost ev-
ery morning instructing them in
the parking system to be used.

Katsur claimed that the lots in
question can accommodate 154
cars and that at present there are
17 openings. He has operated
these lots for over 20 years,
originally as the owner of the
propertyand presently as a ten-

Ipv:-ant of the University. Katsurstill

Katsur said. “We have little»

students who park here. But there
are always five or six who do not

noting that they had no complaints

concerning the operation of the lot.

Katsur renewed his offer of a

added that persons wishing to
‘utilize this offer should see him

Politicians Ponder Law And   Order

 

‘ » by PATRICK A. TIERNEY, JR.

The way the Democratic can-
didate for County Controller
talks, he knows exactly what he
wants and what he is going to
do.

“I’ll be a good County Con-
troller the same way I've been
a good lawyer,” said Rolf Lar-
sen. .

During an interyiew Tuesday,
Larsen stated that the qualities
he feels have brought him thus
far-a highly propelled drive for

, excellence, an awareness of to-

'"'day’s problems, and an ability to

get things done-prepare him well
for the position he seeks.

“People, have to realize that I
have never been a strict eight
hour-a-day man,” he said. And
aside from being immersed in his

,'attorney’s job, he has been a
long time-associate of numerous
ecological and environmental or-
ganizations. He has been a mem-
ber of one of these, the Sierra
Club, for 11 years.

, Larsen insists that a County
Controller is not just a super-

visor or an auditor. The position _

_.he said, has other functions than

‘being the “watchdog of all coun-
ty monies.“ The Controller serv-
es on the prison board and the
salary board among others.

The way L/arsen looks at it. the
diversity of his interests can only
work to his benefit.

His fiscal knowledge. he
claimed, prepares him for the sal-
ary board; which deals with all
pay raises affecting county mon-
ies. But‘ because his life encom-
passes so much more than mon-
ey, he feels he can bring a more
open outlook to such functions as
the prison. board. '

Larsen revealed that his inter-
est in the position stems from his
wish to see priorities, both new
and old, fully implemented. He

/

 

deplored what he termed “fa-
cade ch'ang'es.f’

"I hate to see people killed.
but my money still goes to the
war. I hate capital punishment.
but to this end a lot of our mon-
ey (allocated to prisons) is be-
ing used. And this ‘paradox of
life is all around us.“

Larsen‘s opponent is Robert B.
Friend. who isnot only the in-
cumbent but a well-known name
to old Pittsburgh Pirate Baseball
fans. Larsen has pledged to "do

- the job that Bob Friend has re-

fused to do."

“I know I’m not ‘the biggest
person in the world,” he said,
“but I’ll make my dent, I’ll make
my contribution.” .

Though aware that Friend is a
formidable opponent. Rolf Larsen
fully expects to unseat him. When
he talks of his plans forloffice.
it's not too hard to understand
what. he is trying to say. Rolf

Philadelphia District ‘Attorney
Arlen Specter spoke Monday to
over 100 law students about
crime. air pollution. the prisons
and drugs at the Law School.

Touching on the prisons. Spec-
ter said that "our correctional
system is a misnomer because it
doesn't correct anything. Its big-
gest contribution is a recurrent
eruption of prison riots." He said
that penal reform won't be a re-
ality "till the average man" on
the street understands that we're
talking about his personal safety
as well as prison reform."

‘He said that prison reform
“is the most critical issue in cri-
monology because every prison-

er gets out of jail eventually and-

the high (63%) recidivism repeat
rate proves that he only comes

out more hardened and brutal-

than when he went in ” Specter

 

.Iohn O'Brien, a Democratic
nominee, expressed a general
view of the candidates on this
campaign. “I was amazed at the
apathy of the public towards the
candidates for Common Pleas
Court judge,” he said, Marion
Finklehor, another Democratic
nominee, agreed to this and add-
ed, “The courts are the people’s
courts‘ and are ‘here to protect the
rights of the people of the com-
munity.” «

Most of the candidates tried

-to appeal to’ the youthful aud-

ience by mentioning their acti-
vities to help young offenders
through the courts and in the
community.

Richard Wentley. an incumbent
backed by three parties. said.
"The courts must be partial and

~ also must be aware of the prob-

lems in today‘s society." Edwin
Martin. an incumbent backed by
the Republican and Constitutional
parties. also appealed to the audi-
ence by maintaining that the
courts need “young. energetic.
and active judges" and that he
was the "youngest member of the
court."

In contrast to the views of Mar-
tin, Frank Bolte, an incumbent
backed by the Republican Party,

noted that the average length of

incarceration for a “lifer” is
only 17-18 years.
Turning to drug addiction.

Specter pointed to the increase
in drug related deaths in Phila-
delphia. “In 1962 we had seven
such deaths. last year it increas-
ed to 186 and this ‘year we ex-
pect it will be over 300." He
said one of the major reasons for
the rise in drug use “is the
tremendous shortage of preven-
tive and treatment facilities."

Regarding pollution Specter
stated that “the present fines
against polluters are too small
and are merely a license to con-
tinue polluting," Specter is pre-
sently suing Franklin Smelting
Co. for repeated violations of
anti-pollution laws and has plans
-‘to go after‘ other firms in his
area in'the near future.

During the ensuin‘g question

Judge Richard Wentley, Pitt Law School professor Thomas Cooley

and answer period Specter stat-
ed that he was in favor of civi-
lian review boards but said that
there were sufficient controls on
the judiciary and any irregu-
larities were matters for the bar
associations and not the public.
He also doesn’t believe in “raid-
ing or closing down movie
houses showing alleged porno-

i grapic movies.”

“Our city solicitor wanted me~_.Q:“'

to close a theater that was show-
ing I Am Curious Yellow and
lines five blocks long were wait-
ing to see the film afterwards
because of the qblicity that was
generated," he said.

Specter stated that it is ex-

tremely difficult to successfully

prosecute movie theater owners
because of the publicity that was
the ‘law relating to obscenity. The
same. he said. is true of abor-
tion cases; '

this insight the nurse gives di-

The demand for the profession-
al nurse has produced an upsurge
in the number of baccalaureate
programs with concurrent de-
crease in the number of diploma
schools of nursing. The purpose of
a baccalaureate nursing program
isvto furnish a general education
which strives for effective think-
ing, communicating, and recog-
nizing differing values. Upon
graduation, a nurse adapts this
formal education to her specific
field of interest. To a baccalaure-
ate nurse such fields as teaching,
public health, nurse practitioner,
industrial nursing, and school
nursing are open, as well as the
specialized areas of care within
a hospital.

Graduate education creates fur-
ther opportunities. The recently
developed position of clinical spe-
cialist permits a nurse to con-
centrate her energies in a parti-
cular area. Research, administra-
tion. and community health also
require a masters or doctorate.

Nursing salaries and fringe
benefits vary across the country.
An average salary for new grad-
uates ranges from $7.500 to $8.-
500 per year. A fringe benefit of-
fered by many university hos-
pitals is tuition reimbursement
for advanced education.

PHYSICAL THERAPY students practice techniques on one another.

Therapists Endure

Long Hours, Isolation 

by SUZANNE MCDEVITT

If you are ever unfortunate
enough to lose the use of one or
more limbs. the person who would
teach you to lead a normal life
with your disability would be a
physical therapist. -

Physical therapy is part of what
is called "continuing health care"
and as a part of the whole range of
health. its function has grown and
changed in the past few years.

The University‘s Department of
Physical Therapy (in the School of
Health-Related Professions) this
year instituted a newprogram to
cope with this shift.

Formerly the Physical Therapy
Department ran a program in
which students spent three years
in the College of Arts and Sciences

and one in the Physical Therapy I

Department. This year it changed
to a program where a student
spends two years in the College
and two years in the Physical
Therapy Department.

The reason for this change. ex-
plained Nina Zwahlen. chairman
of the department. is that seniors
were in class 35 to 39 hours a week
(as compared to 15 to 18 spent by
CAS students). Under the new
program, the hours are still long
but the program is spread out
over two years and the students
have more time to correlate the
knowledge they receive.

The change also made it possi- _I

ble to add other courses needed to
facilitate the developments in
physical therapy. The courses are
designed to help physical thera-

pists provide better total care to ‘

their patients, not just teaching
patients to get around on crutch-
es‘. but also informing them of
options open to them after they
leave the therapist's care.

The aim is to make the thera-
pist’s background more broad-

based, not singly oriented to the _' I

patient _but also to the community
around him. )-

One of the biggest (and one of
the few) complaints heard from
physical therapy majors is that
they are isolated from the rest of
the University. More than half the
students enrolled in the program
have transferred to Pitt from
other campuses and schools. so
many of them never have a taste
of university life.

Most days classes are from '9
a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m. “And then."
says one student. "Yhu have to
come back and do’ your anatomy.

And by the time that’s done you‘re~- -

too tired to do anything but go to
bed."

One transfer student believes
that when she leaves Pitt she‘ll
know where the Nurses Residence
and Pennsylvania Hall are located
and not much else. '

The seating arrangement at home football
games is a headache to many students.

The student section is already very small’
and poorly-placed; seat-saving by fraternities
only adds to the problem. Rather than write an-
other in a long series of angry letters to the
Pitt News, we propose _a compromise solution
in the hope that the problem will not-have to

We do understand the rationale behind seat-
saving. Members of any group are justified in
wanting to sit together ata football game. How-
ever. there are two actions taken by fraterni-
ties at Pitt which are not in line with appro-

'* The fraternities have consistently had the
best seats of the student section at every home
game. This leaves the end-zone seats, the goal-
line seats. and the seats at the top of the sta-
dium for the rest of the students (who. by the
way. do represent a majority. > V

The fraternities obtain these seats by send-
ing their pledges to the stadium at‘11:30 A..VI.
save sections of seats for the brothers and
their dates. According to the University. seats
are not to be saved at home football games. In
fairness to all. seats are to be available on a
first come-first served basis. No individual or
group should be allowed to stroll into Pitt Sta-
dium at 1:30 to find the best seats reserved for
their convenience. Ifthe members of 'a frater-

nity want to sit together in the best seats, they‘
should arrive en masse at Pitt Stadium at 11:30.

a University _policeman will
uphold any students ‘right to sit in a fraternity
section, but the seat will not be worth the bo-
ther of finding a University cop or the hass-
ling with fraternity brothers who will become
rather uncivil, to say the least. »

As independent students, itwould be possi-
ble for us to enforce the University‘s no seat-
saving rule. but also very impractical’. As head
of IFC it would be possible for you to stop the
practice of seat-saving. but again very imprac-

Therefore, this compromise is offered. The
independent students will allow the fraterni- ’
ties to ‘continue the practice of saving seats if
a seating arrangement is worked out whereby
the fraternities do not continuously save the“
best seats in the student section. In this way.
the members of a fraternity will be able to sit
together and the independents will be able to
obtain something other than -an end-zone seat.

Should you accept this compromise. a seat-
_ ing arrangement can be worked out by contact-
ing us at 687-6054.

Should you not accept this compromise.
there will be an extra number of University
police on hand for tomorrow's game against
Navy. There will also be an extra number of
independents at the. game early. and we won't.
be saving your seats—we‘ll be sitting in them.

 

Wade continued to mumble
how the bullshit didn‘t mean
nothing. Before leaving he men-
tioned that the Social Commis-
sion of which he is a member
would soon take another look at
just how much money the Frank-
lin Pangborn Film Clubgot and
how it was being spent.

On the following Monday af-
ternoon. his accomplice. Social
Commissioner Lennie Klavonic.
walked into the Pitt News office
and announced with a straight
face that it was his duty to
conduct a public inquiry into the
Film Club. justifying such ac-
tion with the standard collection
of wild charges to which he holds

New Voters’ Impact Probedfo

Youth Vote Analyzed

(Continued from Paye 5)

It is in such a situation that a
minor party candidate with great
personal appeal. from either the
right or the left, could capture a
significant minority of the votes
of the newly enfranchised. If, on
the other hand, one of the parties
nominates a candidate of great
personal appeal to the young or a
candidate who emphasizes issues
which seem relevant to this
group. then the “new voters“
would probably vote overwhelm-
ingly for that party or candidate.

Although great uncertainties
exist concerning the exact nature
of candidates and isses in the ap-
proaching presidential campaign,
the most probable scenario seems
to involve a Nixon-Muskie contest
fought over the President’s han-
dling of the economy.

Preliminary indications are
that neither candidate is excep-
tionally appealing to the newly-en-
franchised and that no issue di-
vides the candidates so much as
the economic one.

Two teams of the William Pitt
Debating Union placed third and
fifth last weekend at the 22nd an-
nual Varsity Invitational Debate
Tournament held at Johns Hop-

A kins University in Baltimore, Md.

The topic .debated was: That
greater controls should be impos-
ed on the gathering and utilization
of information about U.S. citizens

’_by government agencies.

The tournament was the first
major gathering of the season. At-
tendingwere such eastern teams
as Cornell, Penn, Georgetown,
and Navy,‘ and included teams
from as faraway as I‘owa._

' The«Visitor’s Center, in cooper-
ation with Parents’ Weekend will

-tionality Classrooms in the Ca-
thedral of Learning on the hour.
On’Saturday, the tours will begin

If this scenario is reality a year
from now, then I would predict
that young voters will not be a dis-
tinguishable group—-their prefer-
ences will be split much like the
preferences of old_er voters.

This is not to say that one of
these candidates will not move out
in the ‘next year to capture a
greater share of the new vote.
Such a path seems clearly open
to Muskie because of the substan-
tial Democratic margin among
those “new voters” who claim a
party allegiance.

On the whole, however, I sense
that these new voters are still
very much “up for grabs.” They
are likely to maintain this open-
ness until the nature of Campaign
1972 has been well-defined, in-
creasing uncertainty about the
election result but also making for
a much more exciting finish.

There is an added factor which
may increase this uncertainty
substantially. In the past, political
independents have been less in-
terested in politics, less informed
about politics, and less likely to

participate in elections than those
individuals who identified with a
political party.

There is some evidence. how-
ever. that political independence
among young voters represents a
haven for the most politically
aware in a two-party system is
which neither party seems attrac-
tive.

If this is true, then the Demo-
cratic margin among those who

have declared a party affiliation V
may be less important than it-

would have been in the past,
thereby increasing the impor-
tance of the candidates and issues.

More is at stake for the two par-
ties or lanyother political move-
ments, not to mention the rest of
us, than who wins the 1972,elec-
tion. The way in which the “new
voters” vote next November will
influence the ways in which they
are likely to vote in future elec-
tions. ‘

' These voters have been tradi-
tionally not only the most unpre-
dictable but also the most impor-

tant in producing political change.

Not every performer can afford tomake an al-
bum whose purpose is torinsult another performer.

Just as he has caused other controversies and
set trends. John Lennon may do so again with his

latest release. Imagine.

The butt of Lennon’s musical jabs is ex-song writ-
ing partner Paul -McCartney. Presently, McCart-
ney is out trying ‘to create a new group consisting
of himself, his wife Linda, and Denny Laine, refugee.

of the original Moody Blues.

The song: which directs the barbs is “How Do.
You Sleep." It accuseslPau1ie of being just another -
pretty face. and one that is not only stuck on him-
self. but one that is only Muzak to Lennon‘s ears.

To add insult to injury. Lennon doesn't miss.a
trick in his elaborate practical joke: a small photo-
graph of John holding back a peanut-eating pig is
‘included. To those familiar with McCartneys‘Ram
album, this is obviously a take-off on that album‘s

cover photograph.

But.don’t worry, ‘Lennon is too smartto waste a
whole album on any one person, A especially one
‘ ‘toward whom‘ he feels bitterness. _ ‘
Though the rest"of the album is filled with both
direct and indirect social comments,"a few‘ songs
are simple love ditties dedicated to his wife ,Yoko. ,
These are some of the albums lighter tunes. ,

And who ever. thought the day would dawn when

 

% /

Beatle song would remind you of another artist?
Well. "Crippled Inside“ fits that description.

x"Cybernetics’ Exhibits‘

, Although most certainly John
Lennon, it reminds you a little of
early John Sebastian, and you find
yourself filling in the expected
“Spoonful” of harmony. ’

_ Nevertheless, this cut emerges

_ as one of the album's best by vir-

tue of the fact that it is definitely
one of the catchiest melodies on
the entire recording.

The album is an improvement
over the last album in some ways.
probably because there is more

mentals which complement Len-
non’s vocals. ' ' ' .

and dramatic, suffering from a

. slight case of the Long_-an‘d-Wind-

ing Road Syndrome that producer
Phil Spector induced upon Let It

as always. Pleading, witty, mel-

If the Panther football team is
going to build momentum for
the remainder of the season. to-
morrow‘s 1:30 game against the
Naval Academy may be the
perfect opportunity for them to
start.

The Midshipmen enter the
Stadium with a dism_al record
behind them (1-3), while the
Panthers mark is not much bet-
ter. However, in all three of the
Middies' losses they were com-
pletely outplayed. while the Cats
have only been humbled by pow-
erful Oklahoma two weeks ago.

Michigan, Boston College. andi

Penn State have swamped the
Midshipmen in the past three
weeks, with their only victory be-
ing a 10-7 squeaker over V.ir-
ginia.

In all its games Navy ‘has
been hampered by extremely
poor field position. The offense
has operated behind its own 30
yard line about 70 per cent of
the time and inside its own 20
over half the time.

Navy Coach Rick Forzano ad-
mits to the problems of his of-
fensive unit quite readily.
“We're not able to move the foot-
ball too well,” he stated. "We
usually run three plays and then
punt."

Szabat Gains Matured
Outlook In Running

by VINCE DiNARDO

Dave Szabat is a Junior at the
University of Pittsburgh. He is a
psychology major and one of the
many talented athletes on the
Pitt Cross Country and Track
teams.

Szabat is also a different type
of athlete, a refreshing type of
athlete, to talk to. Instead of star-
dom, being an All-American, and
going to the “Olympics as his
primary concerns, he talks of
getting his head together, de-
veloping a correct attitude. and
trying not to get down on him-
self.

This does not mean that Sza-
bat doesn’t want to be a prem-
ier athlete. Rather, that straight-
ening out these other things be-
forehand serve as a prelude to
It. -

Last year, Szabat was, after
Jerry Richey, the top Cross
Country runner. He continued
his fine running in indoor track,
but something happened to him
in the outdoor season. _

“I got down on myself,“ he
said. "I was letting little things
really bother me and as a result

I was developing a bad attitude‘

towards track.”

 

AVE SZABAT
Harrier Star

Szabat really couldn't pinpoint
his problem, but looks to his
more matured outlook this year
to preventing a reoccurance.

This year, to go along with
his better attitude towards run-
ning, Szabat has also been train-
ing harder than before to ‘scratch

-the surface’ of his potential.

That potential, according to
Assistant Coach Don Mollenau—
er, hasn't been tapped yet.

“I don’t think Dave has realiz-

ed .his potential yet," said Moll- .

enauer. “His range is from two
miles up and he could be an
All American."

If anyone should know about
Szabat’s capabilities, certainly
Mollena-uer should. It was un-
der Mollenhauer, when he was
Mt. Lebanon’s track Coach, that
Szabat first began to run. In his
senior year, which was the first
year Szabat had corrfpeted in ei-
ther track or Cross Country,

‘Dave won the WPIAL 2 mile

championship and went on to
place third in the state cham-
pionship.

Before his senior year at Mt.
Lebanon, Szabat was always in-
terested, but never had the
urge to make a team. When‘ he
finally- got the urge. his long
rangy legs took care of the rest.

“Because_of his late start, Dave
didn't get the high school back-
ground in running," continued
Mollenauer. “I thought he 'could
be a good runner. so. I recom-
mended him to Pitt."

Last year, Szabat was running
about 80 miles a week while in
training. This time around, the
lanky runner is averaging about
110 miles a week. Maybe he is
trying to make up what he miss-
ed in high school?

“Sure I would like to go to
the Olympics. and I would like
to be an All-American. but I
don’t set these goals for myself.
I set up hazy goals for myself.
I would just like to be one of
the best runners on our team."

His training so _far seems to-

betworking for that ‘hazy’ goal.
“I think training, is a progres-
sive type thing: Each year is a
new phase. This year I am into
increased mileage." he said.

This year, because of his ma-
tured outlook and increased mil-
eage, Szabat could go far. If
he doesn’t let little things both-
er him, he might not make it to
the Olympics, but All American
is definitely within his hazy
reach. I '

Forzano relies on two sopho-
more quarterbacks to move the
team. Al Glenny and Fred Stu-
vek fill the position vacated due
to the transfer of Ade Dillon
from the Academy.

“I think both have done well
under the circumstances,” prais-
ed Forzano. “Neither of them ex-
pected to be in there.”

Since Navy‘s offense is basi-

-cally the same style as Okla-

homa's. though certainly not as
fast.‘ they pass infrequently.
Totally, the Middle QB's have
passed for just under 300 yards
in four games.

When the Midsh.ip.men resort

to the air. their primary receiv- '

er is wide receiver Larry Van
Loan. a sophomore. Close behind
him in yardage gained is tight
end Steve Ogden.

Bert Calland and Dan Howard
are the top running backs in the
Navy Wishbone. Howard, a Pitts-
burgh native, leads all Navy
runners with 140 yards for a 4.8
average per carry.

Both the offensive and defen-
sive lines for the Midshipmen
are smaller in size as compared to
the Panthers. Forzano recogniz-
es this fact ias another grave pro-
blem for his squad.

“We're not capable of knock-
ing people around on the field."
he said.

Although the Naval defense
has been overpowered in past
weeks (giving up 151 points).
Pitt Coach Carl DePasqua feels
that it is the Navy's strong point.

“Remember, they were losing
to Michigan by only 15-0 at the
half, and similarly to Penn State
14-3,” he commented.

Navy boasts two outstanding
defenders — linebacker Chuck
Voith. and lineman..Glen Nartli.

Owl Soccermen Invade

Following

by STEVE ZYCH

Fans going to the Panther foot-
ball game this Saturday will have
a rare opportunity to see a soccer
game when the soccer team (2-1)

. plays host to Temple (1-1) imme-

diately following the conclusion
of the grid contest.

A large crowd at a home soccer
match would be a novelty to the
soccer team and Coach Leo Bemis
is hoping that most fans stay and
watch his booters take on Temple.
The usual crowd at a Pitt soccer
match is very small. Bemis and
the team hope that they can
change all that and win over some
fans to the sport of soccer.

To win over some converts both
teams will have to score goals.
something which neither team has
been able to do with consistency.
Temple has scored five goals in as
many games (includes three ex-
hibitions) while Pitt has done only
slightly better. netting eight

markers in three games. Both,
clubs. however. boast tough de— A

fenses.

Leading the scoring effort for
Pitt will be juniors John White
(three goals) and Gus Theofilos
(two) both of whom are capable
of scoring in bunches when
they’re hot. White was the team's
leading scorer two years ago,
while Theofilos is rated “a poten-
tial All-American” by Coach Be-
mis.

Attempting to score for the
Temple Owls will be John Al-
bright who transferred from Penn

JERRY KRUTH (25 dark jersey)
contest.
State and Mickey Campion, a Phil-
adelphian. Campion scored only
two goals all last year and his
coach. Walt Bahr. former Tem-
ple All-American. is counting on
him to increase his pro_ductiorL
Bemis said that according
to scouting reports. “Temples of-
fense isn't fast but they’re a good
stand and pass team."
Among the backs that the Owls

will have to get by to score are
fullbacks Fernando Carriquiry.

all of whom are tough defenders.
Senior fullback Jerry Kruth is a
doubtful starter. having injured
his leg two weeks ago against
West Chester.

Thus Saturday’s soccer match
shapes up to be a defensive battle
between two stingy teams. A hard
fought contest could convince a

“ large number of fans that soccer

- is an interesting spectator sport. "

 

Fijis

Smack Triangle;

1971 Touch Football

Season Starts Thurs.

Despite their emptying the bench and using all 21 available play-
ers. Triangle was overwhelmed by the Fijis on Wednesday. 8-0. and re-
mained undefeated in intramural softball this season.

A victory over‘ SAE on Sunday will give the Fijis (Phi Gamma Del-

ta) the division crown. However. an SAE win would force a three-way

playoff.

Half of the Phi Gam tallies were unearnedgwith all eight runs be-

ing scored in the first three inn-
ings. Hurler Barry Sicard pitched
his second straight shutout. with
relief help from Larry McHugh.

Sunday's softball contest on the
Stadium Astroturf between the Fi-
jis and the SAE’s will be the re-
playing of a game two weeks ago
which was won by Phi Gamma
Delta, 11-9. A protest filed by the
SAE’s Mike Poremba was upheld
by intramural director Leo Be-
mis, thus nullifying the win and
necessitating the Sunday game.
A Phi Gam triumph would propel
them into the fraternity league
title round with Delta Sigma Phi
and either Pi Lambda Phi or Phi
Kappa Theta. The latter two
teams will also engage in a divi-
sional tie-breaking game on Sun-
day.

* * *

The 1971 touch football season
will get underway next Thursday
on the all-purpose fields behind
Trees Hall. Phi Gamma Delta,
the 1970 fraternity champs, re-
turn ten of their 12 starters from
last year’s squad. Phi Kappa The-
ta and Delta Tau Delta loom as
the principal challengers.

Any group interested in forming
a touch football ‘team must con-
tact the intramural office im-
mediately. In addition, those de—
siring to referee these gridiron
contests must sign up with Coach

Leo Bemis. _by SIGMON

Knight Named

All-American

Although sophomore Billy
Knight has yet, to see either var-
sity or freshman action for Pitt's
basketball squads. a national bas-
ketball magazine has honored him
with honorable mention All-Amer-
ican status.

Street and Smith’s 1971-72 bas-
ketball yearbook named Knight
and 25 other top cagers in the
country to the list. The maga-

zine’s editors also selected 19 All-‘

Americans, including West Vir-
ginia’s Wil Robinson.

Knight starred at Braddock
High School two years ago and
made the All-State squad.

Last year, Knight was ineligible
to play with the Pitt frosh due to
academic reasons, but he is ex-
pected to be in the starting line-
up for the Panther hoopers this
winter.

"Knight, who is 6-7, is an excel-
lent rebounder and shooter and
will be playing one of the forward
)ositions for Coach Buzz Ridl.

' ' end Steve Moyer, “We’re doggin’ each other.”

DePasqua proceeded to guide his squad to a 46-19
.shellacking of the Middies in the second of four big wins
that year. In 1971 the scene is the same but the squads are
somehow different.

4 Two years ago the Panthers were so numbed to losing

-that a victory was more of a shock then a predictable out-

come. This year there is a» confidence that hasn.’t been
polluted by three years of humiliation. This year there is a.
' 1 winning attitude that pervades the

' entire squad. As Joel Klimek so ac-
curately put it, “Everyone who could
-5 have hurt us has gone.”

Again the Panthers are home
against Navy. They’ve already op-
* ened at the _Stadium but their re-
cord stands at 1-2 the same as it
was two years ago at this time. The
Midshipmen 1-3 have been plag-
.ued by hard luck and mistake-rid-
dled football. They have been burn-
ed by their opponents. Relatively
. s eaking both schools are looking

DAVEHAVERN . fiirabreather. ‘

Coach Rick Forzano’s comments notwithstanding, the
Middies will be out for blood tomorrow. With Miami,
Duke, Notre Dame and Georgia Tech in the wings, Navy
realizes that they are in for rough seas no matter where
they turn. If they plan on winning at all this season Pitt
looms as a primary victim. ’

Last year the Panthers put a damper on the Academy‘s

 

Homecoming week-end by stinging the Middies 10-8 on a A

Joe Spicko field goal late in the game. Then, like now, the
Cats were expected to triumph by a big margin.

The oddsmakers have given the Panthers a 21 point
edge "in tomorrow’s contest, but DePasqua “doesn’t want to
hear about that. This is a better football team then we
faced last year. We were lucky to bring that one out of
there. - '

“His (Forzano’s) team is extremely aggressive,” De-
Pasqua added. “They have a multitude of defenses and they
dog like hell. They’re-headhunters all the way. -They’ll come
at you just like everyone has been comin’ at them.”

The Panthers appear to be_ confident about their abili-
ty to handle the Middies. Their practices this week have
been more spirited then usual. According to veteran split-

The squad is healthier then it’s been at any time be-
fore this season. The original starting offensive line will be
intact with a good deal of game experience backing them
up ‘among the reserves. Dave Haver’s shoulder is okay and
Ernie Webster’s groin injury has been responding to treat-
ment. Dan Lynn was in pads for the first time on Thursday
but he’s been running all week. In short, the Panthers will

be at full strength for the Middies.

As long as confidence doesn’t turn to cockiness the
Cats should play the part of a Naval destroyer tomorrow at-
ternoon. -
