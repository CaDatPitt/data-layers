STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Board seeks

student opinion
on yearbook

Danielle Fox
Staff Wrz'ter

The student body has one more week to voice
its opinion on the fate of Panther Prints, the
University’s yearbook.

The Student Government Board will offer
its survey to assess the studentbody’s opinion
on Panther Prints for one additional week.
The survey is designed to determine whether
students knew the the yearbook existed, how
likely they are to purchase the yearbook and
if they think it is a good use of the Student
Activities Fund. Each student contributes $80
to the fund per semester through the Student
Activities Fee, and the axmual yearbook cost
roughly $41,000 from the fund to produce.

In a ﬁnal effort, SGB President Gordon
Louderback sent an email to the roughly 600

students who had expressed interest in SGB 4

at the Student Activities Fair at the end of Au-
gust. By the meeting at 8:45 p.m, the number
of responses had risen to about 200. Board
member Dave Rosenthal and Louderbackpre-
viously told The Pitt News at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday
that the Board would release the survey results
at the public meeting, but decided to extend
the survey to acquire more responses.

The survey responses are expected to in-
ﬂuence the Board’s decision on whether or

District 8 City Councilman Bill Peduto is
Pittsburgh’s newest mayor after securing
a widely anticipated victory in the general
election Tuesday evening.

As of 11:25 p.m. more-than 95 percent
of the votes were counted. At this point
Peduto had received 35,257 Votes, or'84
percent of all votes. Former state constable

 

josh Wander, the Republican candidate for
mayor, received 4,844 votes, or about 12
percent of the ballots cast.

Because more than 60 percent of Allegh-
eny County’s voters are registered Demo-
crats, Peduto’s victory yesterday evening

» was considered a mere formality by many.

But Wander maintained that during his
campaign he wanted to remind the city,
which has not had a Republican mayor in
almost 80 years, that there is more than

one political party.

 When Peduto took the stage at 9:45 p.m.
at his victory party, which was held at the
Homewood Coliseum on Frankstown Av-
enue, he told the more than 500 supporters
that his election would be the beginning of
a new era for Pittsburgh.

Peduto said that former mayor David
L. Lawrence and other recognizable ﬁg-

ures in the city’s history ushered it into the
“Pittsburgh Renaissance,” which he said
was characterized by “big things.”

These innovators tried to build big at-
tractions that they thought would draw
people to Pittsburgh, such as a racetrack
in East Liberty.

“Tonight we end the era of Renais-
sance,” Peduto said before the cheering
audience, many of whom wore the same
Peduto campaign T—shirts that were on sale
near the entrance to the hall.

Instead, Peduto said he wants to build
up public transit thatwill foster economic
growth by bringing people to the center
of the city. i

of ﬁnance for the Peduto campaign, said

The single fossil site Dmanisi, Republic of
Georgia, rivais numerous sites in Tanzania
and East Africa not only in geological
age, 1.85-1.78 million years ago, but also
and especially in morphological diversity
of human fossils. Recent research has
demonstrated that although brief, the
geological history of the site was not,
as might be expected, relatively
uniform, but rather very complex. This
interesting and unique situation impacts
interpretation of the human remains
and, more broadly, raises important
questions about the interpretation of
human evolution during this period.

Pedutoﬁchose to hold his party in Home-
wood to showcase the neighborhood and
demonstrate his commitment to develop-
ing it and other depressed areas.

“He wants to know what the community
wants and not just have some big—money
developer coming in,” Holtzman said.

Lara Sullivan, a senior adviser to Pitt
College Democrats, and about 15 other
members of the club attended Peduto’s
victory party Tuesday night.

Sullivan, who also serves as the presi-
dent of the Pennsylvania College Demo-
crats, said that she was convinced that
Peduto is committed to diversity.

”If you look around the room,..there’s
deﬁnitely people from all walks of life,”
she said.

Low turnout

While the crowd that greeted Peduto in
Homewood was enthusiastic, things were
slow at Oaldand polls throughout election

From 2:45 to 3:30 p.m., only four vot-
ers left the Engine Company No. 14 polling
station on'McKee Place. Turnout decreased
as the day went on. Between 5:30 and 6
p.m., only two voters left the same polling
station.

Ann Pasquerelli, 64, of Oakland, who
voted at the polling place on McKee Street,
said she voted for Peduto, though she wasn’t
overly enthusiastic about his candidacy.

“He was the only one worth voting for in
the primaries,” Pasquerelli said. “If anyone,
I would rather have [Mayor Luke Ravens-
tahl] back, but that can’t happen.”

The area outside the main entrance of
Soldiers 8: Sailors Memorial Hall, another
polling station on campus, was mostly va-
cant around 1 p.m.

Students walked through Posvar Hall to
and from classes at about 7:30 p.m. without
taking notice of the polling station set up

The Allegheny County Division of Elec-

out while elections are underway.

Mark Wolosik, the department’s man-
ager, said that interest did not seem strong
ampng voters Tuesday. I

“The higher the turnout, the higher
the voter interest, and the more people
will call us asking where they can vote,”
Wolosik said. “And we’re not getting very
many calls.” —

Tuesday’s turnout, which was about 2
percent, was lower than that of thehtwo
previous mayoral elections.

In 2009, voter turnout was about 24
percent, according to Wolosik. In 2005, it
was’29 percent.

mained the last obstacle between Peduto
and the city’s top executive oﬂice. Because
of Pittsburgh’s status as an urban Demo-

primary is usually considered the main
hurdle for those hoping to attain the city’s

A uploaded submissions.

. Louderback explained that the Board does
not have a ﬁnal say on the decision to switch
to the digital photo album and that the vote
represents the opinion of the student body.

Rosenthal told The Pitt'News that he be-
lieves the Board began to distribute the survey
about 2 1/2 weeks ago using Facebook Univer-
sity groups. According to SGB’s Facebook, the
surveywas posted for the ﬁrst-time eight days
ago and posted for the ﬁrst time on Twitter

one week ago. i " “  A

 _ The survey also distributedduring p

last week’s public “meeting. _ -
Louderback said that the deadline lex-

tension was made after he talked to Nuwan

Perera, Academics ‘Affairs Committee chair-

man, about a petition that was released that -
garnered more than 500 student responses. _ .

Perera worked with Board member Thomas
Jabro on the surveyregarding the publication
of OMET scoresvand released the survey in
early October: _ A O
The Board members, according to Louder-
back, would feel more comfortable about their
decision’s reﬂection of the student body if they
had more responses to the survey.
Rosenthal said none of the Board mem-
bers completed the survey, but he posted the
survey on the Facebook pages of each of SGB’s
eight committees.
Rosenthal shared the results of the survey
with The Pitt News at4:30 p.m., when about

i 60 students had responded. Accordingto the

SGBD4

State Auditorjack Wagner, Peduto’s closest

rival, received less than 40 percent of the ‘

Democratigavote. State Rep. Jake Wheat-
ley of the Hill District trailed behind, with
less than eight percent of the Democratic,
primary vote. Community organizer A].
Richardson won less than one percent of
the vote. ‘ ‘

Pitt graduate Ian Lauer, 26, of Oakland,
said he largely agreed that Peduto’s victory
was inevitable as heleft the polling place at
Engine Company No. 14 on McKee Place.

”The primary is really where the mayor

is determined,” Lauer said. “We have been
transitioning power to Bill Peduto since he
won the primary because it is the virtual
assumption that he will win.” ,
Wander, who works as a security consul-
tant, said that he has been in and out of the
United States during the last few months,

traveling to Israel and other countries on

business.

Hezsaid that he ﬂew in Sunday from
Moscow, Russia, and on Tuesday afternoon
said he visited dozens of polling stations
throughout the city, including the Squir-

rel Hill, Oakland and Brookline neighbor-
hoods.
Although Wander’s absence during the

’ campaign season drew criticism from some

members of the public, Wander said the at-
tention he received proved that Pittsburgh
is tired of electing a Democrat as mayor
every election cycle. _
“[Pittsburgh voters] miss having an op-
position,” he said. “They miss havingan
alternative.” I ’

Board in September to discuss the lack of
student interest in the yearbook.

b “While we wanted to get the opinion of the b
student body, we have been the ones working

with [the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs] and have
the most knowledge,” Rosenthal, said. “It’s
the Board’s decision in terms of ﬁguring out
if [the yearbook] is obsolete.”

Board member C.J. Bonge said in aninter—
View Oct. 4thathis biggest concemwas hurt-
ingatradition that students feel is valuable on
campus, butbased on the number of students
who purchased the yearbook, the Board does

not see a sufficient demand.

Bonge estimated that the online photo
album production will cost about $10,000.
According to Bonge, a portion of the remain-
ing $31,000 willpossibly go toward producing
a Traditions book, or a book detailing cam-
pus life and traditions that ﬁrst-year students
would receive at Freshman Convocation. The
rest would revert back to the Student Activi-
ties Fund. 

According to the survey, students com-
mented that they felt the yearbook should
have been better marketed.

Ahearn defended his group’s advertising
techniques.

He said the yearbook was advertised
through email, letters sent to students’ homes,
ﬂyers on campus, social media platforms and
newspaper advertisements. He said that in-
creased advertising would not increase de-
mand for the yearbook. ‘

.. According to Ahearn, 114 seniors regis-
tered to receive afree online copy of Panther
Prints lastyear, and only 40 seniors purchased
a hard copy, for $50.

Rosenthal said the Board had expectedthe
feedback to support the elimination of Pan-
ther Prints because of the students’ reactions

at the Board’s public meeting Oct. 1. During

the op en ﬂoor, students told the Board that it
was the ﬁrst time they had ever heard of the
University’s yearbook.

Rosenthal said he could not answer how
the Board would have reactedif the survey
resulm indicated that students were interested
inypreserving the yearbook because it is too
much of a “hypothetical situation.”

Louderback said that if the surveys showed
that students were interested in preserving
Panther Prints, the Board would sit down
withAheam and Fisherfor further discussion.

He added that the Board would have done

. what it could to save the yearbook, but still

wouldghave cut back the costs.

_ Louderback said that based on the cur-
rent number of students who beneﬁt from
the yearbook, the Board members do not
believe Panther Prints is a responsible use
of allocations. I '

NSA agenda oversteps boundaries of
national security, questions US integrity

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

Before Edward Snowden released
the documents revealing the depth
of the National Security Adminis-
tration’s information-gathering
operation 7 which we all know
now as the PRISM program —
there was a very different idea of
what spying was.

Spying was traditionally’re— .

served for situations in which
diplomacy failed and espionage
became necessary for national
security’s sake. Inlother words,

~ if the government knows little

about a perceived foreign threat
and ﬁnds that communication is
limited or unattainable, then es-
pionage is much more practical
than, say, invasion: I’m looking at
you, George W. Bush.

A After all, the easiest way to im-
pede your enemies is to be one step

t ahead of them, especially when it

comes to terrorism. T
The NSA makes this same argu-
ment for its espionage practices to-
day. Unlike classicjames Bond spy
ﬁlms, the NSA’s practices involve
computer data, not explosions,
and its enemies are terrorists, not
communists. Nonetheless, they
claim that the overall goal is the
same: national security. ‘
However, I have very serious
doubts about the means and the
intentions of the PRISM program,
as I’m sure countless other global
citizens do. In fact, it’s very pos-
sible that the United States uses
the information to gain an upper
hand in the global economy.

"‘ “I'"*can"grant to the NSA._th._at , I

terrorists are indeed an invisible
threat and that this threat requires
a vast amount of information in

n

9

order to unearth it, but there is a
speciﬁc kind of intelligence that
is logically necessary, and I think
the NSA’s scope extends far beyond
the speciﬁcs..

For instance, the documents
Snowden leaked revealed that
the NSA tapped millions of civil-
ian phone records in the United
States. Consequently, the media
publicized this information, and
for very good reason, because it
is seemingly superﬂuous. Admit-
tedly, however, terrorists have his-
torically concealed themselves as
U.S. citizens, so at least the reason
for gathering intelligence within
the populace is somewhat justiﬁed,
even if it is a blatant violation of
privacy rights.

I’m more skeptical, however, of
the reasoning behind spying on the
other subjects revealed through
the leaked NSA documents. It has
recently been disclosed that the
NSA was also spying abroad, not
just on Iran or on Russia, but on
our allies as well. Our very close
allies in the war on terror, in fact.
Evidently,’ the N SA had tapped Eu-
ropean Union oflices and hacked
various computer systems in order
to gain information. The admin-
istration has apparently done the
same to 38 different embassies
and has spied on various United

Nations missions. What has been ,

seemingly most embarrassing for
the United States, however, is the
fact that the N SA has monitored
the private cell phones of 35 world
leaders, most notably, Germany’s
chancellor, Angela Merkel.

U.S. Secretary of State John
_Kerry said that activities such as
these are“notunusual?’ in intema-
tional relations. Perhaps that was
true in the Cold War, but in 2013,

T I ﬁnd this very unusual. As Merkel

put it, “Spying among friends is not
on  Trust amongfriends will now
have to be rebuilt.” Trust is essen-
tial among allies when it comes to
ﬁghting terrorism, simply because
cooperation is necessary in com-
bating a universal enemy.

So why was the NSA commit-
ting risky activities such as tap-
ping Merkel’s phone? Logically, it
doesn’t add up. Germany is just as
threatened by terrorism as we are,
so how does spying on Germany
help us achieve national security‘?
Either this is an extreme case of
paranoia or there is some reason
other than security for spying on
our allies.

This all goes back to something
called the Echelon Network, which
was revealed by the European Par-
liament in the late ‘90s. This was
a more primitive version of the
PRISM data collection program
and was allegedly a cooperative
effort between the United States
and United Kingdom. The net-
work’s primary focus was on in-
ternational trade and ﬁnances. For
instance, the U.K.’s M16 (the British
equivalent to the CIA) reportedly
placed agents inside the German
Budesbank (the German National
Bank) in order to track Germany’s
ﬁnancial ins and outs in an attempt
to be better equipped to compete
economically with the state.

There was also evidence sug-
gesting that the United States
spied on a French ﬁrm bidding
for a contract in Brazil and then
passed the information along to
an American competitor, allow-
ing the American competition to

win the contract. Both of these

Voutsinos  5

examples should clarify the intentions of
the Echelon Network: to use espionage to
cheat the global economy.

What’s concerning is that the NSA’s .

PRISM program might act simply as an ex-
tension of the Echelon Network, and owing
to the allegations that PRISM has already
spied on oil and energy ﬁrms in South Amer-
ica, it doesn’t appear to be too unlikely. All
of this phone tapping and bugging of em-
bassies could reﬂect an American effort to
gain the upper hand in trade negotiations,

Szfcgff Wrz'ter

Pitt senior forward Chris Davis
didn’t start the men’s soccer game
against Howard University with
much luck Tuesday. .

In the 17th minute, Davis sent a
shot at Howard’s net that rocketed
off the crossbar. He corralled the
rebound and attempted to take an-
other shot, but was pulled down
in the box.

Davis, moments away from
scoring his ﬁrst goal, instead drew
a penalty. He’s not the team’s pri-
mary option for penalties, but Nico
Wrobel, Pitt’s go-to in that situa-
tion, was on the bench.

The night began turning around
for Davis, who was awarded the
opportunity to take the kick. He
looked calm for a goalless player
in his approach and tucked the ball
into the bottom left corner to put
Pitt up 1-0. .

“It was great to ﬁnally get a
goal,” Davis said.‘ “[The scoring]
has been absent this season, but

I it is just about the win, really. It’s

nice to ﬁnally get a win.”

And his performance only im-
proved from there.

Davis tallied a hat trick, fresh-
man Kevin Murray added two goals
and freshman goalie Braden Hor-
ton recorded a shutout in Pitt’s 9-0
victory at Ambrose Urbanic Field.

could finish converting the
layup, a whistle blew.

The play was blown dead,
but not by a referee. Rather,
head coach Suzie McCon-
nell—Serio blew the whistle
in the middle of the intra-
squad scrimmage to charge
a personal foul to McManus,

.who attempted to neutralize

Anderson’s forceful motion
off—track with a subtle body
nudge.

McConnell—Serio and her

staff have served as practice-
squad refs to help the Panthers
adjust to 32 rule changes im-
plemented by the NCAA this
summer, ‘most of which pri-
oritized controlling the game’s
physicality.

If Pitt’s exhibition last Sun-
day was any indication of the
degree to which officials will
enforce the new set of rules,
the Panthersand the rest of

the NCAA are in for high—sc0r—

ing games with plenty offouls

A combined 56 infractions
were called Sunday, a signifi-
cant increasefrom last season
when the -Panthers and their
opponents combined for an
average of 32 fouls per game.
Pitt converted 70.6 percent
(24-34) of its free throw at-
tempts in the game, ﬁve per-
centage points higher than the
team average last season.

The offensive outburst led the Panthers
to their ﬁrst victory since Sept. 19, 2012,
against Robert Morris.’

Pitt (1-10—4, 1-8-2 ACC) saw further of-
fensive contributions from John Cordier,
Michael Tuohy, Ryan Myers and Ryan McK-
enzie, with each of themjchipping in one
goal against the Bison (1-16).

Head coach Joe ‘Luxbacher attributed
the ﬁrepower to the momentum Pitt gained
through its early lead.

“The guys got into it and started playing
with a little bit of conﬁder_1ce,” Luxbacher

. said.

After failing to score in their previous

« seven matches and scoring just once in 10

conference games, the Panthers more than

tripled their overall se‘aso'n scoring’output

from a lowly four goals to 

Just 12 minutes, after his ﬁrstagoal, Davis
continued his torrid play  struck again
to give the Panthers a 2-0 lead. Then Tuohy
notched Pitt’s third point when he rocketed
a shot into the upper left corner of the net

past Howard goalie Eric Hamilton, who

unsuccessfully lunged after the well-placed

shot. ,
After striking for three goals in 38 min-

_ utes and two in 12 minutes, the Panthers
would score once more in the ﬁrst half.

After receiving a perfect pass from junior
defenderjulian Dickenson, Cordier ﬁred a
shot from about 12 yards out that eluded a
sprawling Hamilton.

“ [Tonight] is bittersweet, but obviously
it is nice to get a win in your last time play-
ing‘on your home ﬁeld,” Cordier said of
his ﬁnal contest at Ambrose Urbanic Field.
“Tonight’s effort showed that we were ca-
pable of putting up this kind of performance
scoring-wise, so going into our last game,
we’ll give it one more chance.”

Following the halftime break, the Pan-
thers continued to pressure the Bison. De-
spite the continued offensive onslaught,
the Panthers couldn’t convert on a pair of
early opportunities. One shot clanked off
the post, another off the crossbar.

P Pitt did, however, ﬁnally score its ﬁfth
goal in the 61st minute, when Zane Meehan

slotted a through ball to Davis, who turned

V and riﬂed a shot that found the back of the

net for the senior’s third goal.

Davis’ hat trick was the 17th in the
program’s history and the ﬁrst since Nick
Wysong accomplished the feat last season
against Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne. ’

After Davis’ goal, the Panthers struck
again in the 65th minute. Myers buried a
goal oil‘ a passfrom Tuohy, who recorded

 

 

his second assist. The goal was Myers’ sec-
ond of the season and the Panthers’ sixth
of the game. '

_ But Pitt kept up its pressure, even with
a 6-0 lead, through relentless runs, persis-
tent shots and physical tackles on the ball.
The effort resulted in 38 shots, 20 of which
went on goal, and 15 fouls.

Despite his team’s apparent dominance,
Luxbacher credited the Bison for hanging
tough the entire season.‘

tonight, but they are a quality team,” Lux-

last home game, Pitt has one opportunity
remaining on Friday at No. 1 Notre Dame.

Luxbacher said. “We’re capable of playing
pretty well, and we have done it in certain
games, but we’ve always shot ourselves in
the foot. Tonight things started to click,
and the conﬁdence should help, but we’ve
still got to go out and play.” I

RULES

The players have taken note of how
the new rules. might affect their play.

“I think it changes the element of
the game a little bit,” redshirt senior
guard Ashlee Anderson said ofthe of-
ficiating changes. “We have been work-
ing on [adapting], and our coaches
have been harping on not putting our
hands [on offensive players] in prac-
tice and trying tonot be overly aggres-

sive on the ball.” A

Even though Pitt has played only
one game, a 97-67 exhibition victory
over California University of Penn-
sylvania on Sunday, the changes in
the flow of the game and officiating
were clear.

McConnell—Serio admitted that the

.transition is a work in progress for

her team. . A
“It has been tough,” she said. “Look-

ing at some box scores of exhibition

games, there have been games with

THE PITT NEWS

30-some, free throws ta§en.”

With 12 minutes remaining in the
first half Sunday, the Pantiliefrs had al-
ready entered the double  nus, which
granted them two free thréws for each
foul for the remainder _of the half.

McConnell-Serio said 1’
to the players to learn theg;
ofthe officials, saying, ‘‘I think it’ll be
an adjustment by our players.”

She added that stopping the mo-

  
 

mentum ofoffensive players — espe—"'

cially slowing down ball handlers by

using the forearm — will no longer
be tolerated.

V “I think that is the biggest thing
that we have to get adjusted to [is]
getting a feel for the personnel you
are playing against, their speed and

‘quickness and making adjustments in

that regard,” McConnell-Serio said.
In a prepared statement on officiat-
ing, the Women’s College Basketball
Officiating Board of Managers said,
“The state of women’s ‘basketball is at

Ma critical juncture, and we have an op-

portuhity to move the -needle in a posi-
tive way to improve the game through
officiating.”

At officiating clinics this offseason,
the Board emphasized consistency in
regular-season and postseason-play.

“We fully recognize that there is
an expectation that more fouls will
be called and coaches and players will
need to adapt,” the Board continued.
“We are united on the concepts we
want to see emphasized on the court,
and this is a tremendous opportunity
we cannot afford to miss.”

The change was most evident Sun-
day on the perimeter for Pitt, where

, junior guard Brianna Kiesel —-— typi-

cally an aggressive defender on and
off the ball —— struggled to adjust to
the new rules and was the only Pitt
player to foul out. ‘

“Brianna Kiesel ended up having a
tough game defensively just trying to
make plays,” McConnell—Serio said.
“[There were] some tough calls against
her where she fouled out. I was kind of
hoping she would be able to get into
a flow [in] our first game together.”

Kiesel and the Panthers are set to
take on Bucknell at home Friday, which
will be McConnell—Serio’s first regular-
season game as Pitt’s head coach.

Although the transition has just be-
gun for Pitt players and coaches, Sun-
day’s exhibition game left Anderson
feeling that the Panthers will benefit
from the rule changes once players
adjust and the game opens up for of-
fensive players to perform.

“I feel like it will work in our fa-
vorjust because we trust each other,”
Anderson said. “Ifyou are going to be
aggressive, you know that your team-
mates are going to have your help.” I
