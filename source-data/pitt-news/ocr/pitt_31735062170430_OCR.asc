Arrest /vlors SDS Protest

by JOHN A.,,CAPITMAN

A demonstration called “to
support a nationwide action by
the Union of Vietnamese Stu-
dents" was held Saturday in down-
town Pittsburgh. The Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS) and
the Pittsburgh Guerilla-Theater

A‘ ” sponsored the event.

The demonstrators gathered in
Mellon Square initially and moved
on to picket the Frick Building.
headquarters for this area's Com-
mittee to Reelect the President.
The group later marched down
Fifth Ave. to Market Square. re-
turning eventually to the. Frick
Building.

Saturday’s activities were pre-_

viewed on Friday with a rally in
the form of Guerilla Theater held

ygn the Cathedral of Learning lawn
‘ at noon.

Richard Fishkin of the School of
General Studies explained that the

rally. entitled “Tricky Dicks
First and One and Only Press
Conference," was an attempt to
“give people something to laugh
about because the real Richard
Nixonis something to cry about.
but the main reason was to build
for the demonstration on Satur-
day."

Among the attractions of the
open press conference were the
“Mellon Genocide. Award,” given
to the “most racist member of

A the presidential staff,” and “Mel-
vin Laird as the Cisco Kid who
can wind down the war while drop-
ping seven Hiroshima’s a week.

Saturday’s demonstration was
marred by the arrest of an SDS
member at the Frick Building.
Matt Schneirov, a Pitt junior, was
charged with disorderly conduct
and fined $10. with an additional

_ $11 in court fees.-

Before handing down the fine.

. Denounces draft, drugs, and Nixon

Judge John Chappas of the Muni— '

cipal Court Number One told
Schneirov. "I don’t care if you
were demonstrating against the
war or picketing, that is an exten-
sion of your civil rights under the
second amendment. but being loud
and boisterous, and scaring the
people. as the police have said you
were. is clearly illegal."

Schneirov maintained that his
arrest was “a form of harass-
ment,” but added that “we must
have been doing something right
or they wouldn’t have bothered ar-
resting me.”

He told Judge Chappas that he
“had not been told not to use a
bullhorn. and as soon as I was. I
put it down." Schneirov admitted
being "upset" about his treatment
by the police.

After his initial release. several
members of SDS engaged the ar-
resting officer. Sergeant Seigreff.

Russell Promotes People Power

Bill Russell. former basketball
player for the Boston Celtics.
packed the Student Union Ball-
room at a speech sponsored by
the BAS last Friday. A member of
the U.S. Olympic team in 1958. he

ﬁﬁs played basketball for 25 years.

In 1968. Bill was named Sports-
man of the Year by Sports Illus--
trated. and in 1970. Athlete of the
Decade. He recently appeared on
the Flip Wilson Show.

A very amusing speaker, Rus-
sell kepthis audience laughing
while he revealed hislthoughts on
.a number of subjects.

“When I« went to college, the
food was murder” was a remark
which received a sympathetic re-
sponse. “I always thought that
our parents were trying to kill
us,” he continued. '

Blll. RUSSELL: "Be happy!”

The speech soon turned from
general topics to more specific
ones. Speaking of marijuana. Rus-
sell said. “I personally oppose the
use of drugs and strong alcohol.
The reason that I oppose this is
that we have too much to do in too
short of a time and too much to
see. And the best thing to see is
the truth—the pure and beautiful
truth."

Russell also mentioned the fact

that when he was in high school-

the conviction for smoking mari-
juana "was greater than the..con—

 

yiction forfsecond degree ._murder. if  .-B“? hal7¢.,,tl‘l5 P_"°ble".‘.‘_ We

Russell remarked» that it was
"rather weird.“

He spoke of the Olympics as the
“political event which has just
finished” and of the elections as
“the athletic event which has just
begun.”
thought of the African nations and
the brothers here who were trying
to get Rhodesia out of the Olympic
Games, Russell’s answer was:
“The Olympic Games are 60 per
cent politics and 40 per cent ath-

letics.‘ The only time we get upset ‘

is when we disagree with the po-
litics.”

He also said that it would be a
good idea if all the countries
would wearthesame uniforms in
order to get nationalism out of the
games. -

When asked about the situation
of the two black athletes who did-
n't stand at attention_ duringthe
playing of the National Anthem

hand were consequently thrown‘

out of the games, Russell said:
"They were looking for the black
athletes to do something. The first
time they would do something
they would put them up. " V -

Speaking about the draft, he
said, “The idea of a volunteer
army is the most frightening thing
I’ve ever heard of in my life.” He
referred to the aspect of the army

-becoming an elitist group with no

checks and balances built into the
system. He would “draft every-
body—the women too,” but- three
regulations would be imposed.

First. nobody would be drafted
unless they were at least 40 years
old. Second. nobody would be
drafted who made less than $10.-
000 a year. Lastly. anyone who
ran for politicaloffice would have
top priority. v A 19 year old young
man has not lived enough or loved
enough to go off to war." Russell
said.

Healso spoke of drugs in pro-
fessional sports. saying that for a
time he used dexies and sleeping
bills. but "my performance as a
player kept going down. What hap-

- pened was that I was playing like

a regular player." ,

Russell mentioned unemploy-
ment, “Five per cent of the'peo-
ple in this country are unemploy-

don’t-like people who are on wel-
fare. That’s kind of weird.”

Russell stated that although it
took us only eight years (from
1961 to 19691 to land on the moon.
15 years after the Supreme Court
ruled out segregated schools.
Richard Nixon said. "I don't be-
live in desegregation."

A constantly recurring theme
was that people must be concern-
ed about each other and about
what is happening in their society.
"If I would give you any advice.
it would be to think and ‘partici-
pate in society.“ he said.

“The greatest thing that we’ve
got going for us is the people, and
the biggest problem is that a lot

of people don’t want to get involv--

ed. Life is all about people. So-
ciety is a creation of man, made

to work for man. I get high on peo- .

ple.”

Bill Russell spoke of his great
belief in people and his concern
for their welfare. His last words
were "do me a personal favor-

be happy!"

Labor Committee to

Assess ZPG’: Worth

by KARL BALDYS

On Oct. 19. the Pittsburgh Labor Committee of the National Cau— 
cus of Labor Committees will hold a forum. entitled "The Zero Growth 
Movement." The forum will be a discussion of the zero population‘; . 
growth movement. its worth for. and effect on, the working class. P‘  

“Within the coming week we’re going to send ZPG an invitation‘ to l—.)."=l‘.“l¥l-
the forum," said NCLC publicity man Mike Micale. “But, I don’t know ,5-.:
if theyllaccept. _ . . 1 ' ~  ' ' ' 

In a brief summary of NCLC policy, Zero Population Growth was
tagged a “threat to the working class.” The paper contends, “The.cur-
rent rush of “zero growth” ecology movements which prepare to»bolt..; 
economic growth, represents a reactionary trend which translates em.- ' "
pirical evidence of economic and technological crisis into a despairing, 9,
anti-human policy of austerity.” The paper goes on to claim that the-

development of technology, particularly nuclear fusion, is the answer  .
to population growth. I ‘ 

“The Zero Growth Movement" is the first of several forums set”
up by the'NCLC for the comingmonths. A second forum" is already
scheduled for Oct. 25 to discuss "The Socialist Alternative to the _.
Phase Two Twins (Nixon and McGoverm.“ Future conferences will‘;
examine the counter culture, Marxist analyses of history and artand -
analyses of the world economic situation. ‘ "I

 

  
  
 

According to Micale. NCLC was formerly a part of the Studentsfor‘ *9 -:,‘i
a -Democratic Society. “In 1968. the SDS Labor Committee of Columbia "1 
split with the ‘SDS over a strike on campus. By 1969, the NCLC’ was
formed,“ He went on to note that one of the founders of the organiza-
tion was Lyn Marcus, political theorist and author of Dialetic Econom--~
ics, which will be published in the spring of 1973. '

The PLC has been operating on the Pitt and Carnegie-Mellon cam—

Last Thursday's Student Govern-

.-ment meeting touched on a num-

ber of areas, but the major decision
made was to draft a letter to the
Chancellor to inform him of stu-
dent’s feelings concerning the ath-
letic program at Pitt, especially
the football program.

""We won't say- if someone
should be asked to leave." said
Ken Krenicky, “but we have to
improve the athletics program be-
cause the students care. Student
Government and students are
fed up with athletics and a good
football program improves school
spirit."

' Other topics discussed at the
meeting included the ground-
breaking for the Law School. re-

‘. organization of the programming

committees, a report from the
Legal Awareness Committee and
the long sought after Szabo Food
Contract.

President Tom Bailey reported
on his talks with Szabo Food man-
agement. The dinner hour w.ill

 be‘ extended to 6:30 p.m., and

there is a chance that breakfast
hours will be extended. The
Tuck Shop will be open until-
8:30' p.m. daily, vending mach-
ines in the Cathedral will be
open until 9:15 p.m. to allow

‘ »..night students a chance to buy

minutes in the Towers.

plan. According to his computa-
tions, aqstudent pays $222.00 to
Szabo for food; the remaining
$78.00 goes to the University for
upkeep of the cafeteria. On a
daily basis, a student pays $2.11
for three meals.

Discussion on. programming
began when Terri Weaver said
that it is not being done in ac-
cordance with the Student Gov-
ernment constitution, causing
problems with emergency alloca-
tions.

"It’s not our programming com-
mittee's fault, or the Student
Union Board committees fault.
or Allocations. but the way it's
set up now is poor,“ she said.

"We have to iron out a way
so our Programming Committee
can talk with the other‘Pro-
gramming Committees—not to
compete, but to fill in the
gaps." -

She suggested a new committee,
comprised of three members
of the Student Government
Programming Committee, two
from the student Union Board
Programming Committee and one
member from the Student Gov-
ernment Board.

Dave Wahljchairman of the
Committee of Student Organi-
zations (CSO). reported that
his office plans to run compre-
hensive checks on all student

organizations because many dup-,.

licate others on campus.

Bailey also requested a change
in the wording of the CS0 by-
laws for new members on coin-
mittees based on “the approval
of the Student Government pre-
sident and senate" to "approval
of the Student Government
Board."

Freshman Nancy Shanhan and

per year, per student of the meal

Richard Tarquinio were approved
by the Board as new members on
the CS0.

Bailev mentioned that tickets
are still available at $7 per stu-
dent for the Penn State-Pitt foot-
ball game. The ticket includes
the $6.00 admission fee to the game
and $1 bus fare. Tickets for the
Jazz Seminar, to be held the 18,

able at the Student Union Ticket

ROTC Fights For Credit

by JOHN A. CAPITMAN

“The College of Arts and Sciences ‘gives no
credit for ROTC, and this is not much different from
other institutions throughout the United States.“
said Army Colonel Basil Mishtowt, to the assem-
bled members of the CAS Cabinet last Thursday.

The Cabinet, a student advisory forum for the
CAS and FAS Councils, holding its third official
meeting last Thursday considered the proposal by
the Army and Navy ROTC that they be given the
same status as other departments of the University,
thus making their courses eligible for credit and
subject to CAS review.

“I will be the first to admit that we have courses
that I would be afraid to put before an Academic
Review, but all we’re asking is that, as in any other
departments, credit be given to our courses which
have real academic value,” Mishtowt explained to
the Cabinet. A

Jeff Pasek, from Legal Awareness, and a
member of the CAS Council, brought up the question
of "whether or not sufficient remuneration is given
to ROTC students without the addition of academic
credit,“ but the sense of the meeting was that since
"not all ‘of the students involved in the courses were
paid by the military,” this would not be a consider-
ation.

Two other questions about the ROTC program,
however, were considered: the first brought up by

‘Cabinet Chairman Ron Eskin was ROTC's status‘

as “an outside, self-perpetuating group, working on
a purely contractual basis” with the University.
The second was raised by members of the SDS who
were present at the meeting, charging"that “75 per
cent of the officers in Vietnam are graduates of

ROTC and credit for military courses would imply A

University support of the war."

The three students presently enrolled in ROTC
who attended the meeting felt that these were not
the correct considerations; “that the point, in fact,
is that students spending large amounts of time in
ROTC courses also have to carry a full CAS sched-

ule, and since the courses are academically val- '

uable, this-seems unfair.”

The discussion of standard departmental stat-
us being given to ROTC was called at 9 o’clock, at
which time the question “of giving legitimacy to
the CAS Cabinet” through the election of represen-
tatives from each department of the College, was
brought up.

Ron Eskin explained that the present goal was
to clear with each department head the idea of elect-
ing a student who would be privy to departmental
decisions concerning curricular matters.

After reports of the results of “confrontations"
with various department heads, the feasibility of
such a Cabinet seemed good. Eskin went on to say.
"We can, with this system, be influential—this is
the way you get power.”

number of students. Kozol noted
with humor that his girlfriend,
who failed college because of
math became the math teacher
and libraries were set up "by peo-
ple without degrees in library sci-
ence." .

‘Kozol stated that the best

ic in Boston. -
Stephen is just one example of
the brutalities that exist under the
guise of education in ghetto
schools. Through the development
of the free school, Kozol and the
people who have worked to create
the free school, try to counteract
the ridicule, the conditions, and
the educating of children into vio-
lence that they have suffered.

Ending the war in Indochina is
.the most important issue facing
the American people in this elec-
tion year. The people of this coun-

 by our government and the mad-

‘ bomber Richard ‘Nixon.

The U. S. has had an involve-

 sources in Indochina. This war

of his “secret plan” and “Vietnam-

of “changing the color of the

Nixon’s slow withdrawal of U.S.

_ land troops was planned as an elec-

tion' maneuver to create enough
illusions in the minds of the peo-
ple to win Nixon’s re-election. But,
from the very beginning this
plan included the concept of leav-

Government of S. Vietnam has a
Seven Point Proposal that could

They ask that Mr. Nixon with-
draw all U. S. forces from Indo-
china, and that he stop the sup-
port of Thieu by setting a date
for the end of military and eco-
nomic aid to his regime. In re-
turn, they will release all P.O.W.‘s,
safely return allU. S. troops and
they will set up a coalition gov-

ally refused all such proposals.

On the other hand, President Nixon, displaying

troops have been withdrawn from South Vietnam.

No Second Chance

by JAMES PROZZI
College Young Democrats

A man who thought in 1965 that Lyndon Johnson wasn‘t bombing 1"

the North enough, that U S planes and warships should strike "day
by day. and for that matter, night by night" to prevent the war's be-
ing lost to "imperialist Communism“-was not a very good bet to get
us out of Vietnam. But, circumstances can alter opinions, and that
man, Richard Nixon, later said he had a plan for peace; Four years
ago this week, on October 9, 1968, he wanted, to "Make one thing
clear: Those who have had a chance for four years and could not
produce peace should not be given another chance. . . . We will take
that chance." Well, in 1968 the will to believe was strong, even
though Nixon's performance was weak. So he was given his chance.
And here we sit, four years later, on the verge of giving Richard
Nixon the second chance he himself said should not be given.

At this point in time, it doesn‘t do much good to once again
review the history of our involvement in Indochina in order to ‘per-
suade people to repudiate it. A better way, perhaps, of "debating”

the war is to look at some of the myths people have come to ac- A

cept this year about the war.

The history of our involvement in Indochina the past 25 years
is one of deception—as the Pentagon Papers clearly show. But today,
we are in danger of being deceived again, lied to again, in an elec-
tion year. ‘ 1

The biggest lie is that the war is winding down.

When Nixon took office he could have gotten out of Indochina
and let the people settle their own affairs, as we should have done
from the beginning. Instead he chose war, to prolong our involve-
ment through the substitution of American air power ‘for ground
troops. He called it “Vietnamization.” Ellsworth Bunker, Ambas-
sador to Saigon, called it “changing the color of the corpses”, The (‘L
policy, then and now, really is a cynical belief that Americans will
indefinitely accept a relatively .“invisible" war _from the skies. and
ignore all else so long as American blood is no longer shed.

This administration has lowered American casualty rates and
withdrawn US troops from South Vietnam, but the war still expands
and the costs are increasing. In his search for “peace” Nixon has
invaded Laos and Cambodia, and mined the harbors of the North. He
has dropped four million tons of bombs, a million more than 1965-68.
There are today 150,000 military men in Indochina along with one-
half of our B-52 force, one-half of our aircraft carriers, two-thirds of
our fighter bombers, and half of the Seventh Fleet. According to
official Pentagon and US Senate statistics, under Nixon six million
people have been killed, wounded, captured, or made refugees
since 1969. Thus, rather than winding down the war, Nixon has re--
Americanized it by his substitution of US planes for ground troops.

Another cruel myth is that we are remaining in Indochina in
order to force the return of our Prisoners of War: It now seems the,-
opposite. Nixon is using the POW’s as an excuse for keeping our milii‘ 
tary forces in Indochina. If his sole concernwas the POW’s why
should he increase their numbers by sending more bomber crews to 1
be shot down? Common sense should tell anyone that no country
is going to release captured enemy personnel while it is still being
attacked and threatened, as North Vietnam is by our military forces. 0
And common sense should also reveal that once we set a date to end
this immoral war, the North Vietnamese would have no sensible rea-
son for keeping our prisoners. '

The third lie is that "progress” is being made at the peace talks.
This is perhaps the most deceptive claim of all, because it leads Ameri-
cans to believe that, in our present situation, we can have an "hon-
orable" end to this war. What Nixon shuld be doing instead is pre-
paring the ‘country for the realization that our involvement was a
mistake, that we were wrong to intervene, and that we must get
out now. For the hard truth is that no progress had been made or
ever will be made as long as the American government clings to
Saigonsmilitary dictator Thieu. With his one-man elections, his jail-
ing of his opposition, his forced urbanization of his rural countrymen,
and his abolition of Parliament, hamlet level elections, and opposi-
tion newspapers, the illusions of democracy and self-determination
have vanished. This imposition’ of a puppet government, against the
will of the Vietnamese people, in the last analysis, is the main ob-
stacle to peace. ' ‘ '

Nothing stains the honor of the US more than the continued kill-
ing of the Indochinese. The only “peace with honor” is the position
of George McGovern. He has been forthright on the issues of the
war, calling it, in 1963, a “policy of moral debacle and political
defeat.” He would end all US bombing and ground naval opera-
tions immediately. He would set a 90 day deadline for total with-
drawal and would terminate the imposition of the Thieu regime on
the Vietnamese people. The Provisional Revolutionary Govern-
ment of South Vietnam (PRG) has made it clear, as have the North
Vietnamese, that if we do this our POW’s will be returned. This
is the only way we can get them back. In addition a coalition gm?-
ernment will come to power in Saigon, composed of members of the
Saigon government'(minus Theiu), neutralists, and the PRG. If we
do not set the ‘date, and if we allow the “secret” plan of Nixon to
continue, the slaughter and the POW imprisonment will continue
indefinitely.

Mr. Nixon flubbed his clance, and whatever the B-52 in the
White House may next promise or threaten, there can be no return
to sanity until he is replaced—by George McGovern. The war is
the paramlount moral issue in this election. We need a leader who ~
willturn away from Vietnamization and toward the pacification of
America. For we ought not forget that ‘the war has shown us what is
wrong and must be changed in America. If this tragic war then per-
mits us to view ourselves in. a more realistic light, stripped
of the illusions and the arrogance of power, something indeed worth-
while will have come from it. And in the end, if the Vietnamese
secure theirlindependence, the American people will be the vic-
torsaswell.. . '  -‘ 1 ‘  1 5  _' V

* Corps cles Gourmandes

by JEFF PAS_EK

' Everyone in Pittsburgh who en-
'  joys kosher style food usually
makes his way to Weinstein’s at
one time or another. Having eaten
there once, he usually returns.

Weinstein’s was a Squirrel Hill
. favorite for many years until a
i,‘ fire gutted the entire building.
After several months of, renova-
tion, the restaurant was reopened
' A last year under the same manage-
__ ment that owns the Gazebo in
 Shadyside and Canter’s in Oak-
~ - land.
  Featuring a large selection of
' 2 food, Weinstein’s has gained its
,' reputation for many dishes rang-
. -ing from corned beef. sandwiches
and baked goods, to full course
_ dinners. Weinstein’s is one of the
only restaurants in the Pittsburgh
' area which serves both Great
 "Lakes white fish and boiled short
'1 ribs of beef.

The dinner menu offers 25 dish-
es and is changed daily. Prices
2 are a little high for sandwiches,
' -and range from $3.50-$7 for a full
course meal. Entrees are also
available a la cqrte.

  

 

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
  
   
 
 

. Unlike many of the area’s finer
' (restaurants, Weinstein’s does -not
limit itself to a dinner menu. A
wide range of breakfast and
brunch items is featured. Not

only are the typical breakfast
.dishes offered, but such foods as
jg-smoked salmon, sable fish, and
cheese blintzes are among Wein-
stein’s most popular dishes. If you

. start

are looking for a good place to
Sunday, Weinstein’s for
brunch has to be the top attrac-
tion in Pittsburgh.

If you happen to stop in during
the afternoon or after a movie
(several theaters are nearby) be
sure to look at the sandwich
menu. Not only does Weinstein’s
offer a choice among roast beef,
turkey, corned beef, and pastra-
mi, but you also have the delica-
tessen choice of mixing and
matching pretty much at will. For
example, you can order a roast
beef‘ sandwich by itself or with
chopped liver. Then try adding
either turkey or corned beef if you
like. Or else, you can start with
a pastrami sandwich and add tur-
key and swiss cheese. On the
other hand you can have your
dream sandwich built around hot
corned beef with turkey and swiss
cheese, or convert it to a Reuben
sandwich by- adding pastrami,
saurkraut, and swiss cheese.
Whatever sandwich you choose, be
sure to sample the relish dish;
Weinstein’s serves some of the
best pickles in Pittsburgh.

If you would rather have a_ sal-
ad than a sandwich you can
choose from a shrimp bowl, Mau-
rice salad, chicken salad, tuna
salad, antipasto, or Caesars salad
bowl.

And, of course, Weinstein’s is
also aidinner restaurant. While
some entrees change daily, you
can usually count on finding prime

If you're the kind of person who
enjoys more in a restaurant than

just the dinner, you can probably.

find dozens of reasons to make
Weinstein’s one of your-favorite
eating places. Weinstein’s con-
tains a small lounge where _you
can order your favorite cocktails
before dinner. The average price
of mixed drinks is about $1, and a
fair assortment of wines, bran-
dies, and liqueurs is offered.

Weinstein’s is one of the few
restaurants left these days where.

the service is still friendly. Even '

students are attended to prompt-
ly.

After dinner, if you can still
think of eating, we would suggest
a visit to the delicatessen and
bakery department. Here you
can choose from a full line of pas-

“ tries, cold cuts, cheeses, and

other food specialties.

However, Weinstein’s isn’t the
perfect restaurant. The dining
room isn’t particularly well dec-
crated. The restaurant. is often
crowded and noisy. The busyboys
are a bit overzealous in clearing
dishes so that one sometimes
feels a bit rushed through dinner.

But Weinstein’s doesn't bill it-
self as a gourmet paradise. Wein-
stein’s is a family restaurant. And
when you combine a family res-
taurant with kosher style food,
you have a place that’s good to eat
at anytime of the day, a place
where the chicken soup is good,

Folksinging ‘Werewolf’
v *Prowls of Bimbo's  

by WILLIAM SMITH
Entertainment Editor

(Editor's Note: This is the third in a series spotlighting local talent.)
Who is Harry Waller. man? And why does he sleep with his eyes
open? '
Color his beard Dylan. Put a Donovan twinkle in his eye. Give him
the Guthrie gift of a wry smile and cynical wit. Pepper this with the

light-hearted spirit of a Kweskin and you’ve got a delightful mishmash

named Harold Eugene Waller.

The other night I stopped in Bimbos for a pepperoni twist (not the
one recorded by Joey Dee and the Starlighters) and there on the stage
in a halo of red, yellow, and blue lights stood the one and only, Man for
All Squeezins . . . mostly lemon, the Werewolf of West View himself. ‘

Harry Waller isa folksinger/songwriter leaning toward the jug ‘

(band that is) and he sleeps with his eyes open because he’s afraid of
falling out of bed and ruining his white goose-feather suit by Haresong
of Bwana Dish.

I first heard Harry in 1968 when he was spotlighted by a now de-
funct band of potted begonia fanciers. This was about a year after he
had decided to drop the “heavy“ veil of rock and go solo.

“At 13 I watched the Steve Allen Show and ‘Jim Kweskin’s Jug
Band came on. They did Washington at Valley Forge, and from that mo-
ment on I haven’t been the same.” -

“I went through the typical high school hip scene,‘ played in a
14 year old punk band doing folkrock, Byrds stuff. then a stint with a
"heavy" rock band, and I finally ended up on downtown street corners
playing for nickels, dimes. and peach pie.”

He feels the folk scene in Pittsburgh is very poor.

“Pittsburgh is not a folk town.”

"This towndoesn’t recognize its own talent, especially in the field
of folk." . _

“Other college oriented areas have places where big name folk tal-

ents can just walk in and start playing. Bostonand other college towns

do it but_nowhere in Pittsburgh can you find any clubs which are geared
to this." ,

Waller is the Nijinsky of flat pickers. He plays six and 12 string
guitar, six string banjo, autoharp, harmonica, mandolin and B flat
kazoo.

‘ Most of the songs Waller writes are in the contemporary folk vein
but he has a “raggy side” that he falls back on.
He believes that most musicians have a lighter side that, they rely
on "when things get sticky or serious." V
“When you’re down you need your friends to help you but some-
times everybody seems to be falling out and hostile.”

“That’s when you have only yourself to depend on and if reality be- 
comes too intensely depressing you_have only your natural absurdity to ‘ ‘L

save your psyche."

The ragtime spirit is by no means common in the Pittsburgh area
and it is this element which has made Harry stand out.

‘ He has been featured on several local radio and television specials
during the past year. A Channel 13 coverage is tentatively due to be
aired within the next week or so.

Harry’s favorite musician is Barney Cook, who plays the world’s
only E trombone (made from the melted down cannon used in the mo-
vie The Pride and the Passion. 2 ' _

The question is “Can a young folksingerforsake the love of a
blonde, semi-acoustic Gibson girl and find happiness in a test tube?"

For the answer to this and other questions consult the Lusitania‘s
logbook or go see Harry Wallerwnow playing at Bimbos on Monday,
Tuesday or Thursday night. i » '

An Academic Appraisal

  I Italian Exhibition Attacks Aesthetic Anemia  

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Any examination of the philoso-
phy which has motivated the pho-
tographic exhibition, "Art and
Landscape of Italy, Too Late to be
Saved?” which opens this Thurs-
day at the University Art Gallery
of the Frick Building, poses a
number of questions which throw
light upon the aesthetic amemia

which infests our technological

society.

According to Dr. Arcadi Nebol-
sine, executive director of the
Italian Art and Landscape Foun-
dation, and Pamela Bardot, Di-
rector of the University" Art Gal-
lery, the present exhibition has
been designed “to protect the fu-
ture integrity of works of art”
with the Italian project as a def-
initive "case study” of what re-
mains to be done in other areas
of the world as well.

Due to pollution, ignorance,
and general apathy, the’ desecra-

v tion of some of mankind’s finest

artistic achievements has occur-
red and continues to occur. A ca-

tastrophe has been specified and _

the problemvhas been set before
us in black reality through this
upcoming exhibition.

While we have all been made _

aware of an ecological movement
which (mis) places too much em-

phasis "on the "elements and the ‘

earth and completely ignores
man’s varied attempts to express
his creativity through works of

art, the sin of desecration looms’

ever more darkly as entire build-
ing and other artistic achieve-
ments fall completely into ruin.

I The reader may very naturally
ask what hearing this exhibition

and the entire movement have

upon him, and this is, of course,

- when aesthetic ignorance has be-
come so deriuer. Personal ex-

perience on the part of this writer .

’not4on1y on the Pitt campus but
even in Europe leave him to won-
dering just where aesthetic con-
cernhas gone.

Not only are our universi'ty’s
students unconcerned-but so are
the Venetians and the Romans.
And while there are admittedly
many Fine Arts courses offered
on’ this campus and while there
is likewise an opportunity for the
Venetian and Roman citizen to
experience some of the glories

-of man’s artistic achievements

“in the flesh,” the apathy wrought
from ignorance is indigenous to
both sides of the Atlantic. -

Needless to say, we have not

defended our call for an aesthetic -

awareness on the part of our stu-

dents. While we could discuss all’

 



the artistics niceties and__drawi

upon such terms as “apprecia-
tion,” "heritage,” “cultivation,”
and others like them,‘ this would
obscure the message completely.

We have depended much too
much upon academicians and
their research (as Berneson des-
cribes it). Books, lectures, "(and
papers have been written while

things have fallen into absolute

ruin, and all because we have not
cared to be independent and to
think of such matters on our own.
Our ignorance, however. is not

— entirely of our own accord. The

idea of education and exposure
in these instances have ‘not taken

hold of those who are responsible I

for the academic community.-

Despite this, good news has
come our way with the advent of
the upcoming exhibition. The pros-
pects of a “floating” program de-
voted to the training of students
in not only artistic appreciation
but also in the necessitiies of
preservation may yet be a reality
in our own academic community.
A program such as this has al-
ready been formulated at Colum-
bia University and it certainly
would be commendable if we were
presented one on the same order.

-And if only such a program
could emerge as some phoenix
from the artistic ashes for which
our city is noted. Primarily, our
principal worry is that of the
bureaucratic red tape that such
a new program entail. Those in-
volved inevitably go here and go
there and explain this and explain
that and the process becomes so
drawn out that the idea eventually
dies out. (Need we recall to what
extent other programs have de-
teriorated? )

Both the exhibition and the pos-
sibility of a preservation program

centered in our city’s academic

institutions point to a wider ac-
cess to places of artistic beauty‘

within the sphere of our existence »

and the need for the general pub-

. lie to feel a concern for aesthetic

matters.

If we are to be true to our roles
as students, we must go and seek.

And this is why we urge all stu-

dents to go and see this often
startling exhibition. We also ask
that they express their concern
and be prepared to -support a
“preservation” course of studies
which may "originate here. If we
do not express our concern now,
no one will remain to do so after
we have lost our already waning
opportunity.

South Bend, Indiana—With a sell-
out crowd of 59,075 enthusiastic
fans on hand. the Fighting Irish
of Notre Dame handed the Pitt
Panthers their sixth consecu-
tive loss of the 1972 season. Notre
Dame blasted Pitt by the deceiv-
ing score of 42-16.

With the Panthers bringing it
to the 7th ranked Irish and play-
ing the most exciting football of
the hapless season, they let mis-
takes get the best of them, never-
theless. The Irish capitalized on
two first half breaks to go into
the _locker room with a 14-0
halftime lead.

Ara Parsegian's troops, using
the talents of seven_ different
runners, proved too much for the
agressive Pitt defense.

Andy Huff—thei5-ll, 210 pound

fullback from Toledo, Ohio--who

is turning into the Notre Dame
bread and butter man, scored three
touchdown on short runs.
That, coupled with the smart
running of Pittsburgh native Tom
Clements and Darryl Dewan was

Booters Break Slump
  At Grove City '5 Expense

by BART MACK

Breaking out of a short two
game losing slump, the Pitt soc-
cer team romped to a 5-1 victory
over Grove City College, Sat-
urday at Grove City. The win is
the second for the booters against
West Penn Conference oppon-
ents.

Joe Luxbacher, the team’s lead-
ing scorer, powered the offensive
line, scoring a, three goal hat
trick. Luxbacher now has tallied
six goals so far this year in six
games.‘ Bob Kohlmeyer and John
Curly also found the range as
the booters enjoyed their most
productive effort this season.

Pitt, the defending West Penn
‘champs, are now 2-0 in confer-
ence play with three more
West Penn opponents remain-
ing on the schedule. Although the
booters will probably post a per-
fect record in conference play,
they may run into some problems
in attempting to retain their
crown.

‘NA  .

JOE LUXBACHER, number 22 pictured above, pursues the ball against

   

Akron. Luxbacher tallied a three goal hat trick against Grove City on
Saturday, and now leads the team in scoring with six goals in six

games.

Currently, Pitt is in second place
in their division, trailing Alliance
College. Alliance posts a 6-0 re-
cord to date with a match against
Grove City coming up this week.
The problem’ is that Pitt does
not face as many opponents as
Alliance, and will not meet Alli-
ance either.

Harmful Triad

  Stops

arriers

by LYNN HARRIS

Confusion about the course, injuries, and a virus all contributed
' to the 23-32 loss suffered by the Pitt cross country team at West Vir-

ginia University on Friday.

Don Sauerand Bill Huntington both of WVU took first and sec-

£3-ond place respectively with winning times of 31.118 and 31.135. Mickey

Collins of Pitt took third place, his time being 31.39. Other Pitt run-
ners to place were Bob Steele capturing fourth. Nick Martin-sixth,
Bob Schurko tenth and John Black 19th. '

Running a six mile course changed radically from two years’

‘ago the harriers ran into confusion. When the team arrived at WVU
two guides showed them the golf course on which they would be run-
ning. While looking it over the two guides noticed the map they had

was incorrect.

Not knowing what to do they continued to show the team the
course. Instead of running around the perimeter, the course was
extremely complex. It went criss cross. Receiving further instructions
the team was told to take a particular loop three times.

With actually a half mile to go WVU kicked and Pitt thinking
they had another mile of more to go was confused. Not realizing what
was going on they later found out that instead of taking the particu-
lar loop three times they were supposed to take it only two.

Since the division champion-
ship will be determined by per-
centage. both Pitt and Alliance. if
they. both remain undefeated in
will qualif_v for the
title. ~

Pitt coach Leo Bemis. one of
the founders of the West Penn
league and president in the first
two years of its existence. had a
solution to offer if the situation
does come up.

“It was never discussed and
there is no provision for it, but a
playoff could be arranged to de-
termine a champion.” Bemis
said. “It would have to be agreed
between the two teams.”

Grove City could play the role
of the spoiler against Alliance
and Bemis had some words of
praise for Grove City after the
game.

"They were real hustlers and
showed good spirit,” Bemis re-
marked. “They outheaded us,
especially at midfield.”

Pitt goalie Eric Holt had a shut-
out going throughout the first
half as the booters controlled the
first frame with a three goal lead.
Grove City managed to beat Holt
midway through. the second half,
but Pitt countered with two goals
of their own to put the game out
of reach.

One factor that Grove City
used somewhat to their advant-
age was the familiarity of the home
field. The Grove City field is a
shorter, more narrow field than
any Pitt has ever played on and
the booters had to adjust-their
game plan. - ' '

 PanthersFﬁllTo Powerful Irish

enough to springboard the Irish.

The Panthers, extremely ex-
cited, stole the show and domin-
ated the first half of play, de-
spite being down by 14 points.

Near the end of the first quar-
ter. Notre Dame posted the first
score of the mistake filled after-
noon. The drive did not come
without the help of the big
break, however.

Punting on a fourth down
and four situation from their
own 26 yard line, ND punter Briam
Doherty was roughed by Glenn
Hyde. Hyde had partially blocked
the first ND punt and barely
missed doing it again. With the
fifteen yard penalty and the first
down, the Irish completed the 80
yard drive in 11 plays. Clements
highlighted the surge with a dra-
matic 22 yard gain, after being
apparently trapped in his own
backfieId.: .

Huff scored from the four and
Robert Thomas converted for the
point.

Defensive end Rod Kirby cut
short another Irish drive by re-
covering a Dewan fumble on the
Pitt 16. but the South Benders
used a Pitt offside penalty to
score their second touchdown.

Apparently stopped on the Pan-
ther 22 yard line, Thomas missed
a 38 yard field goal. In apparent
eagerness to block the try, one
of the Pitt defenders jumped
off-side.

The revived drive brought
about the second Irish score, with
Huff going in from the four again.

Unwilling to fold. the Panthers
took the second half kickoff and
engineered a 61 yard 13 play
drive of their own.

Quarterback John Hogan even-
tually hit fullback Dave Jana-
sek with a two-yard scoring pass._
It was Janasek also who had
kept that drive alive earlier by
breaking through the Golden
Domer's rugged defense on a
crucial third down situation, rip-

Murphy’s Law doesn’t apply on
Friday, the 13th. Not only doesn't
it apply. but everybody on the Pitt
’-junior varsity football team knew

it. Every player knew that they

 would defeat Maryland, and that's

exactly what they did, by a score
of 27-13.

The game was held at Pitt Sta-

f"i.- g dium Friday afternoon before an
 1' -enthusiastic crowd of about 500.

Terps; Berrien Stars

the first period on a 62 yard 11
play touchdown drive. The drive
was highlighted by longruns by
Ted Berrien and Mike Mehalik,
as well as a 23 yard pass from
Rich Washinko to Doug Bolog-
nese. Calvin Branch carried the
ball across the goal line from the
two yard line to net the TD.

Maryland was unable to move
the ball against a stingy Pitt de-
fense and was unable to get near
scoring position until late in the
first half. Meanwhile, Pitt’s of-
fense kept plugging and the next
time they got the ball after the
first TD, they scored again.

Don Herold replaced Rich Wash-
inko for this one, and Herold took
it in on a one yard run for the
touchdown. «

The second TD was set up by a
35 yard interception return by
Grant Abe, which gave Pitt the
ball on the Terrapins 14-yard line.
Herold’s pass to Branch gave Pitt
the two point conversion, and Pitt
lead, 14-0.

Maryland began to move the
football but time was running out
on them in the first half. A pass
interference call in the end zone
gave the Terps a first down on the
Pitt one, and two plays later, sec-
ondstring quarterback Tom Scar-

MARYLAND

bach ‘carried the ball across with
20 seconds left in the half, mak-
ing the halftime score 14-7, Pitt.

The Maryland team, which had
won its first three games of the
season, came out of the locker
room for the second half highly
enthused, but not as high as they
had been at the start of the game.

Their enthusiasm was to no
avail though, Murphy’s law had
the day off. Pitt’s enthusiasm be-
gan to increase.

Following an exchange of punts,
Pitt took over on the Maryland 35,
courtesy of a roughing the re-
ceiver call against Maryland. ‘

With Herold again in at quar-
terback, Pitt marched down the
field on a succession of running

I plays, and finally, with the ball

on the-three yard line, Herold
dropped back to pass.

All of his receivers were cover-
ed, but Herold scrambled until he
saw Berrien all alone on the op-
posite side of the end zone. Just
as he was about to get creamed,
he threw to Berrien and the score
was Pitt 20, Maryland 7.

Maryland came right back, and
on a drive again aided by penal-
ties, scored when Roger Tuck
rolled in from the two.

The score was 20-13 and shortly
after a 45 yard run by Washinko,

Berrien scored his second touch- .

down of the game from two yards
out to cement the victory.

"This was a total team effort."

Bill Russell:
  The /vl-A-N

by BILL PROUDFOOT

The name conjures up multiple images. Bill Russell—for a dec-
ade the only living mortal who dared swap elbows and stomp on the size
sixteens of black Goliath named Wilt Chamberlain. Bill Russell-
whose shot-blocking ease was akin to plucking fat, ruby red McIn-
toshes from your backyard tree. The man who made the Boston Cel-
tics. The man in NBA history, baby.

As part of their monthly lecture series, Pitt’s Black Action So-
ciety brought Russell to town on Friday. He was in Pittsburgh not as
another ex-jock-turned-jokester, stumbling through some time worn
anecdotes, but as a man. That’s M-A-N. ’

_ “You must be a basketball player," a gawking spectator, who
spied Russell at a large hotel, once told him.

“I’m a man who plays basketball, not a basketball player,” Rus-
sell calmly told the ogler, “and you can’t deny my humaness without
losing some of yours.”

And, that commet set, the tone for the entire
hour and a half talk to the crammed standing room
crowd at the Student Union Ballroom on a chilly,
gray Friday the 13th. Sometimes downright hilari-
ous, often times somber as a preacher, Bill Russell
succeeded in conveying his humanism.

Towering above the microphone, Russell warm-
ed up the gathering with a few boyhood tales ala

 

RUSSELL Bill Crosby.
“Parents were always trying to kill us kids,” he deadpanned, "No,
really. . . . Why, they’d cover the vacant lots with asphalt, then put up

money bars and swings so‘s we could kill sourselves.”

The crowd buzzed and cackled, and from that point, Russell was a
maestro playing virtuouso with his audience. He brought in the more
serious stuff.

“Marijuana had been smoked in the ghetto for years, virtually un-

‘ noticed by apathetic whites,” he said. “It wasn‘t until drugs reached

out into their white communities, that they became concerned. Drugs
affect us all," Russell continued. “They affect you and they affect me.”
It had been 15 years since the Supreme Court declared segrega-
tion to be unconstitutional. After a decade and a half “we’re still trying
to get our kids in school together. When you see evil anywhere, fight it.
If you see injustice, fight it. Fight it out of enlightened self-interest.”
Then the billy goatichin perked up and his darked eyes twinkled.

Despite the tightening of purse
strings in Pitt‘s athletic depart-
ment, the Women‘s Physical Edu-
cation Department is still trying
to do its part in involving fe-
male students in athletics.

"We try to do our part to pro-
mote the athletic programs offer-
ed." related Margaret Covert.
head of the Women’s Physical
Education Department at the Uni-
versity. "We are also always try-
ing to promote excellence in per-

however. have forced a reduction
in the programs offered to the
female members of the student
body.

Last year Pitt boasted five
women’s varsity sports—swim-
ming, gymnastics, volleyball,
tennis, and basketball. ‘ ~

This year, however, only four
varsit_v sports will be carried
along with a modified tennis
program.

cided to go with a modified pro-
gram." explained Covert.

Another contributing factor to
the placing of tennis on a non-
varsity level is that Pitt's tennis
coach. Dr. Merigold “Goldie’
Edwards, is on a sabatical leave
for a year.

The revised tennis program
consists in only scheduling to
play schools in the Pittsburgh
area.

"We’ve scheduled some matches
within a small radius," said Co-
vert. "The team is still practic-
ing—they're trying to keep up
their skills.

“But they need more women
to join the team. Right now there
are only about five to six people
who are basically interested,” she
continued.

Covert would like to see more
attention from Pitt students give
the various programs in the de-
partment. -

    s..i.s....,...,i    

"At most of the games a few
people show up. The different
teams play good schools like Kent
State. Ohio State. and Penn State."
commented Covert. “It‘s very in-
teresting. we only wish the stu-
dent body would come up and
see what's going on here.

“We try to enrich the program
and we’re always looking for
talent. We only wish the student
body would show some interest,”
she said.

Three of the four sports still
on a varsity level of competition
are in the process of practicing
for the upcoming seasons. These,
teams are volleyball. swimming.
and gymnasties._ Coaching the

‘squads are Eileen Surdoval. Vir-

ginia Grindle. and Gail DiCicco.

respectively.

Basketball will begin practice
drills in December and heading

There were two injuries at the
outcome of the meet. Micky Col-
lins suffered a pulled tendon in
his foot and Bob O‘Neil suffered
a strained tendon in his calf.

“Having a rocky start this
season,” stated Mollenhauer, “I
really thought the team could do
better.”

Mollenhauer also commented.
"Confidence is extremely im-
portant in running.”

"I can‘t really say but I feel
that WVU was in excellent mental
condition and ran as a team.” said
the coach.

“Pitt had a slightly weaker
mental condition,” he added.
This was probably due to the triad
of injuries, illness and confusion
over the courses.

The next 'ineet will be the
Canesious Relays on October 28th.
Hopefully the harriers will score
their firstvictory there.
