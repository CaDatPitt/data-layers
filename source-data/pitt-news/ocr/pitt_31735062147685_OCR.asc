Reading a well-written, carefully-

phrased speech, Harold‘L. Ickes; sec-
retary of the Interior and director‘of
the Public Works Administration,
Monday evening at the Community
‘Forum discussed Herbert Hoover, at-
tacked the American Liberty League

_ and‘ William Randolph’ Hearst, and de-

fended the New Deal.

Shortly after his opening remarks,
which had to do with the growth of
public political discussion in the last
few years, Mr. Ickes launched into a
vigorous survey of the political philos-
ophy of the “old deal administration”
under Hoover. He satirized the two-
chickens-in-every-pot ideology, and
pictured Hoover as a pitiable, bewil-
dered ﬁgure, the leader of “a do-noth-
ing-administration.”

In the same vein Mr. Ickes momen-
tarily touched on other prominent
ﬁgures of the Republican party of that
administration. He mentioned Andrew
W. Mellon‘; he named David Reed,
former U. S. senator from Pennsylva-
nia, as the man whose career was “un-

M; Beck, prominent constitutional at-

“the TVA were not shared by the Su-

These gentlemen, continued Mr.
Ickes, “and other of their ilk com-
prise a school of turtle-like statesmen
. The administration of Hoover
was the ne plus ultra in govern-
ment . . . and takingtheir cue from
Mr. Hoover they go about the country
moaning the familiar dirge of despair
. . . The perfect ﬂower of their
statesmanship is the proposal that we
discard the New Deal and reclaim the
old deal from the junkyard.”

According to Mr. Ickes, this is the
issue before the voters. At this point,
he deﬁned what the term “New Deal”
means to him: “. the greatest
good for the greatest number.” Mr.
Ickes claimed that this isn’t a new
idea, that it has been the aim behind
any enlightened government. The
difference, Mr. Ickes maintained, is

The Court Question ~ 

I-IILE APPEARANCES may be deceiving, it is gen-

erally felt that any week now we're going to run
into some good, old-fashioned spring weather, with its
accompanying outdoor life, and particularly outdoor
sports.

This brings us around to the often quoted observation
that the University could well use a few more tennis
courts. At present, four courts are available for close to
10,000 students. Two courts have been built in the Sta-
dium, but these are strictly for use by the tennis team.
With the exception of those enrolled in physical educa-
tion classes, students pay $1.50 for the privilege of using
the courts in the spring and $1.50 for the same rights in
the fall. A fee of $5 gives the student year-round priv-
ileges.

The charges are fair enough; they are virtually the
same at other schools. There is no questioning the fact
that the courts must be kept in condition and repair if
they are to be of any great value at all. But it does
seem certain that several additional courts could and
would be put to good use, particularly when more than
a few students will claim they have signed up for tennis
in gym classes during four or six different semesters and
have not yet found an open court on which to play.

It may seem ludicrous to suggest more tennis courts
in the face of the recently published ﬁnancial report of
the University, which shows a four thousand- dollar ‘de-

The Pitt News

ﬁcit for the last ﬁscal year. There is, however, some-
thing of a way out offered in the form of an area, located
behind Trees Gymnasium, which is already graded and
drained, two major items in court construction costs.

Material for the necessary fences, posts, and nets
would not cost a great deal, and there may be a possi-
bility of diverting NYA workers to assist in preparing
the courts. There is also the conjecture that the addi-
tional courts would bring, in greater ratio, more money
in the form of fees.

Tennis is rapidly becoming the outstanding form of
individual exercise. A team of players does 11012 halfe 120
be gathered for a game and virtually anyone who can
hold a racquet gets a kick out of playing.

All work and no play makes Jack and Jill a. pair of
dull youngsters. If a lot more University students want
to play tennis than can be provided for with present fa-
cilities, then there ought to be a way to enlarge those
facilities, particularly when the students are willing to
to pay fees for the chance.

Dr. Carlson, President

T was NO SURPRISE that Dr. "H. Clifford Carlson re-
turned home from New York thislweek with the title,
President of the National Collegiate Basketball Coaches’
Association. If the Pitt students had been doing the
electing, Dr. Carlson would have had the job from the
ﬁrst and could retain it indeﬁnitely.

Newcomers to Pitt have to meet this fellow Carlson
because he gives them their physical examinations down
at the Falk Clinic. And this fellow Carlson. who com-
bines the duties of director of the student health serv-
ice and varsity basketball coach, has made it his game
to remember every one of the newcomers he meets there.

A graduate of the University, recorded in the annuals of
Pitt athletics as an outstanding performer in football,
basketball, and baseball, he is devoting his life to the
students of the University. He has sacriﬁced the ﬁnan-
cial gains of a private medical practice to be with young
men, to help see that the youth of Pitt gets along.

Vi-rtually all of us could take a few pointers from “the
good doctor.” He is one of Pitt’s ace boosters; he will
at any time turn the subject of conversation to stress
this or that feature of the University, or to offer this or
that suggestion to aid one of its students. He has never

been too busy as a physician and coach to have a
word of greeting for any one who comes along, He robs

himself of more time by being a salient part of the Uni-
versity’s orientation period for freshmen each fall; he's
a faithful visitor at freshman camp and sees to it that
his freshman basketeers get down there.

Whenever you see that huge gray touring car, loaded
with college boys, making its way over the campus, you
may hail its driver with every assurance that there will
be an answering hail and a smile from him. He will be
Dr. Carlson, doctor, basketball coach, now president, and
always a gentleman, one who has an incurable desire to
be of service to the boys who come-to Pitt.

Calling All Platforms

AST YEAR The News made an attempt to gather

brief statements concerning their platforms and

plans from each of the 60 candidates for seats on the

Student-Faculty Assembly. A large majority of the can-

didates submitted these, and the interest the statements

aroused was of such extent that we are planning to re-
peat the procedure this year.

Before someone else does, we hasten to admit that a
very large percentage of those who were listed as “did
not submit a platform” were swept into oﬂice last spring,
most of them by high ballot totals.

Whether this was coincidence, a. trick of Fate, or a
logical consequence, we are not prepared to say. We feel
certain, however, that no symptoms of “bad luck" will
dog the footsteps of anyone simply because he .has had
his platform published. A platform is only a platform
but it does give voters some insight.

Key To The Wedlock

Some of these new courses on marriage and marriage
problems seem to be very popular. At Syracuse Uni-
versity there are 130 enrolled in a marriage course
and there are 415 on the list waiting for a chance to
enroll.

 

Keep Off The Grass
The grounds foreman at the University of Georgia is
poetically inclined and, as a result, the Georgia cam-
pus displays this sign: ‘

 

“U. of Georgia son or daughter
Do you love your alma mater?

If so, it should be your duty

To protect her vernal beauty.
Man or woman, youth or lass,
Please don't step upon the grass."

is That Nice?

Officials of DePauw University have posted direc-
tions for proper conduct in case of ﬁre. Students
have added their own pertinent comments, most ap-
propriate of which is: “Notify the dean of women-
she’ll throw a wet blanket on it."

 

Why In The Spring A Young Man, Etc.

Love making is caused by vitamins, according to
findings at the University of Washington. The reason
for renewed and increased enthusiasm of lovers in the
springtime is laid to the fact that the change of diet,
dependent on spring fruits and vegetables, arouses that
romantic vein of thought. Professors claim that a fel-
low has a. betterchance of standing in better stead with
his girl friend duringthe» winter if he“ drinks plenty ‘of
orange juice.

Some Become Umpires

A blind student was a candidate for the Syracuse
University wrestling team this past season. The stu-
dent has been blind for only four years and depends on
his remembrance of wrestlers in action shown in motion
pictures.

Maybe He Does
Miami University calls its annual freshman dance
the Freshman Strut.

Or Earle On Troubled Waters

Governor Martin L. Davey of Ohio has been rather
rough on the state allotments of funds to Ohio State
University. As a result, an old epligram is being
passed about on the campus in this new form: “Don't
put off until tomorrow what you can do to Davey."

No Homework

Warner College gives a course in “Life Problems"
to its seniors. The course deals with the more intimate
difficulties of everyday life and includes everything from
how to ﬁll out your income tax blank to how to select
a mate.

Where Avoirdupois Counts
’Tis said that the freshman class at Texas A. and
M. is planning a dance where the price of admission
would be determined by the weight of the girl friend.
The rate was set at one-half cent a pound, but if one

should take a girl weighing more than 140 pounds, ad-,

mission would be free."

lated these promises into legislation."

Commenting upon critics of the
New Deal who have advocated going
back to the policies of older adminis-
trations, Mr. Ickes asserted that these
critics are guilty of “some dishonest
thinking" . . . or . . “making reck-
less promises. I venture that there is
not a candidate who would dare to
turn back the clock.”

That the New Deal has made mis-
takes, Mr. Ickes does not deny. “We
are merely human, but we have at
least honestly tried to do something."

In considering the American Lib-
erty League, Mr. Ickes waxed ironic,
with such phrases as “liberty-loving
d_u Ponts,” “master economists Wil-
ham Randolph Hearst and Colonel
Robert ll/lccormick.” A new principle
in taxation technique has been advo-
cated by these gentlemen, “a soak-
the-poor” program, he said.

During the question period, when
asked what he thought of the Alle-
gheny County Authority, Mr. Ickes
replied:

“I think differently about that on
«different days. However, tonight I
am your guest.”

Dr. Metzger W/ill Speak

Dr. Irvin D, Metzger, prominent
Pittsburgh eye specialist, will be the
speaker at today's ﬁfth hour meeting
of Chi Rho Nu, honorary pre-medical
fraternity. Dr. Metzger will discuss,
“This Business of Obtaining a Posi-
tion.” The meeting will be held in
Room 801, Cathedral.

‘Dr. Metzger is scheduled to speak
on various aspects of specialization,
general practice, and the relationship
between the city and country doctor.

Letter

Editor, The Pitt News:

As members of the Senior Class, we
believe Margaret Speer, our presi-
dent, worthy of nomination for Senior
Queen. Perhaps she has been over-
looked; if so, we think our class has
erred.

Peg has led the class successfully
this year, and if she is capable of per-
forming that job, she is surely de-
serving nomination for that perform-
ance alone. Her activities this year
are numerous and she merits recog-
nition. In addition to leading the
class, she was treasurer of Mortar
Board, chairman of the successful
Heart Hop, chairman of the Float
committee of Spring Festival, Senior
Mentor, member of Transfer Council,
and member of the Senior Ball Com-
mittee, without mentioning numerous
other positions she has held during
her four years at the University.

Her scholarship rating is well above
average. Peg has worked hard this
year, We are ﬁrmly convinced. She
has done all in her power to make this
Senior Class an outstanding one. Last
year she worked for us as chairman
of the inter-class Sing. We are, we
believe, expressing the sentiment of
the class when we say that we think
Peg Spear deserves nomination for
the Senior Queen award.

Trackmen, Golfers Open ,
Outdoor Season Saturday

University Handicap Meet
Listed For All Trackers
Saturday Afternoon

' Coach Carl Olson"s track season
there at the University gets going full
blast after last week's clinic at-‘the
track house with this week-end fea-
turing the third annual running of the
University handicaps Saturday on the
Stadium cinders.

The handicap meet opens the out-
door season for the Olsonmen and
plans are being made for the most
successful handicaps since its inaugu-
ration back in the 1934 season. More
than 100 entries are expected, includ-
ing the entire varsity and freshman
squads. V

Even cold weather and a soggy
ltrack failed to slow up last year's
handicap meet. Charley Groat tied
the University record in the 880-yard
run, while Menaker, Musico, and
Kiger showed high class running for
so early in the season.

With the trackers expecting a bet-
ter break in the =wea.ther,than that in
the ﬁrst two meets, old records seem
to be in danger of being broken. Most
of the varsity men will start the
track events from scratch, thus giving
them a fair crack at the records.

Many Winners Back

A list of 14 events is on the pro-
gram and handicaps of distance will
be determined in each event. Last
season, handicap ratings ranged from
four to 200 yards in the different
track contests, while thewiie,l_d events
had a range from afew inches to‘ 30
feet. The same variations will also
probably be used in the meet Satur-
day. -

There will be a number of men in
the entry lists this year that won
events in the 1935 meet. Sol Menaker
will be back in the 220-yard dash,
Charles Groat in the 880-yard run,
Andy Lasky in the 120-yard high
hurdles, Gene Taano in the javelin
throw. Fassinger in the discus throw,
and Pete ‘Bennett in the high jump
and broad jump. Bennett led the in-
dividual scoring last year with ten
points.

Pitt Riﬂers Take 11th
In Sectional Title Meet

Panther riflemen didn’t fare so well
in the sectional match of the inter-

The varsity sharpshooters had to be
satisﬁed with 11th place.

First honors were taken by the Mid-

At Alcoma Course '

 

When they step out onto the ﬁrst
tee Saturday, four Pitt golfers are
hoping that they will have plentyof
trouble packed up in their old golf
bags for the Red Cats of Western ‘Re-
serve with whom they match strokes
at Alcoma in_the season’s fairway
premier. . .

Two weeks has been all the time
the Panthers teemen "have had to
sharpen their irons, and these two
weeks have been ﬁlled with distinctly
negative weather conditions. Even so,
Saturday’s match will serve’ as agauge
on the potentialities of Pitt’s,1936
golfing hopes. V - - ‘

ters’ league standing.

As yet the playing quartet has not
been deﬁnitely decided. According to
Art Snyder, golf coach, the ﬁght for
positions will continue on until Sat-
urday afternoon.

One certain starter is Johnny Was-
co, the only remaining regular per-
former from last year’s crack brigade.
Frank Souchak seems headed for a
position among the ﬁrst four. No. 5
and No. '6 men of last year, Bob
Mease and Morry Rosenbloom, will
rank a. few notches higher Saturday;
a.nd then there is Art Symonds, who
toured California's links last year for
the Stanford team in addition to Chris
Herron.

Mountaineer Mitt
Team Wins ECA
Ring Title Again

The ﬂood only delayed the inevita-
ble as West Virginia's rangy Mount-
aineers, coached by Eddie Vacheresse,
again» captured ‘the’ ‘coveted "team
trophy of the ﬁfth Eastern Intercolle-
giate Boxing Conference tournament
held last Friday and Saturday at the
PAA gymnasium.

After two closely fought rounds,
Captain A1 Paslowski of the Panther
team ﬁnally succumbed to the speed
and shiftiness of Denver Welch’s left-
handed attack in the 125-pound ﬁnals.

Conti, 135-pound W. & J. pugilist,
gained an unpopular decision over
Pitt’s Abe Konick in one of the best
bouts of the evening.

As the only other Panther entry,
George Dines lost by decision to
Mountaineer Littlepage in the 155-
pound division. Littlepage carried
a bit too much height advantage for
Dines.

Carnegie Tech took its lone title
when Brooks Ely, the outstanding
ﬁghter in the tourney, scored his sec-
ond knockout of the championships
against Neilson, Mountaineer mitt-
man, in the 165-pound class. .

game of the spring training session.
, Every man on the squad of 45-odd

Bob LaRue scored late in the ﬁrst
quarter from the three-yard marker,
as he bumped off an opening over left
guard for the initial touchdown. Pat-
rick’s conversion was inside by inch-
es, with LaRue holding the ball.

The “Blues,” composed of the boys
with the greater amount of varsity
experience, did not score on the less-
experienced Yellows until mid-way in
the third quarter when LaRue again
pulled the ball into scoring position.
Patrick ﬁnally scored" the touchdown.
This time, Frank Souchak scored a

When 11 Pitt boys outfought, outgained, and completely upset a team
that had been “the talk of the country,” Dr. John Bain Sutherland, c0a.ch
’ of the “11 iron men,” made no sub-
stitutions in a 60-minute session of
bruising defensive football. It was
the greatest thing he has witnessed
in his many playing-coaching experi-
ences with the most successful sport
teams in intercollegiate athletics.

.-Pitt that year had only average

Howard Harpster had quarterbacked
the Skibos to one of their few vic-
tories over the Panthers, 6-0. In the
opening game of the season, the
Mountaineer “shootin’ irons" from the
West Virginia foothills blasted aerial
shots that hit. the Pitt score-board
nine times as compared to the Pitts
six-point total. A

' But with only two games to go,
they moved into the land of six-foot
corn and grid huskies. Jack Doyle,
of New York and points East, quoted
the Pittsburgh odds at 3-1 or several
touchowns. Blue Howell, fullback,
was rated as one of the best backs in
the country as was Nebraska's Reb
Russell, who two years later moved
on to Northwestern where he won

Fifth Avenue Boys
Take Swim Crown

 

Nose Out Strong-Vincent Natators
In Interscholastic Carnival

Coach Larry Danver’s Fifth Avenue
high natators came through in gallant
fashion to win the 22nd annual Uni-
versity interscholastic championships
held at Trees pool last Saturday. All
told, the swimmers from 24. high
schools cracked 11 records during the
day. I

During the afternoon trial events,
six old marks were erased, and in the
evening some of the afternoon times
were smashed as the high school boys
wen-t ﬂying through the water.

Al Beacon and the state champion
medley relay team led the city boys
to a hard fought triumph. After the
qualifying events, it looked as though
Erie Strong-Vincentfwhich sent eight
men into the ﬁnals as against Fifth
Avenue’s ﬁve, would have things its
own Way, but the city champions,
making every qualiﬁer a point-getter,
nosed out the Erieites, 25 to 23.

In the Pitt championships, two old
records went off the books. Tom
Locke broke Jack Hanna's mark in
the 440-yard freestyle and Captain
Russ Lindb-erg bettered his time in

, the 150-yard backstroke.

Football Candidates Scrap,
For Varsity Team Positions

 

Double Practice Drills Planned For Tomorrow As Squad
Looks Ahead To Short 3-Day Vacation Period

 

Double practice sessions are scheduled for the Trees Hill practice ﬁeld
tomorrow as the small squad of 45 Panther grid candidates advances to the

close of the third week of spring training drills.

Following the Friday ses-

sion, the squad enjoys a three-day vacation while the bulk of the students
call “time-out" for a period twice that long.

Spirited ﬁghts for team positions on the 1936 eleven have increased the
pace of the Pitt squad. From now on in, every man steps along at a fast
clip in this swift-moving, formative: '

period of Panther football elevens.
When next fall rolls around, Dr.
Sutherland and his coaching corps
will have a pretty good line on just
“who’s who” for the strenuous nine-
game fall campaign.

In typical Pitt fashion, the full-
back department is reminiscent of
the late Weinstock-Weisenbaugh days
with several boys showing every indi-
cation of forming a new combination.
Bill Stapulis, Frank Patrick, John
Dou_gert, and Chickerneo form a quar-
tet of lads with plenty of that “Fly-
lng Dutchman and line piling”
drive. Patrick, although only a soph-
omore letterman, can boast the most
experience at, the position.

Stapulis, the California ﬁyer who
only last fall was converted from
half to the ball-handling slot, how-
ever, has been developing rapidly and
now ﬁnds himself sharing top-position
with Patrick.

Dougerﬂ Still In Running

Chickerneo, quarter on the 1933
frosh team, shows possibilities but,
as is common with most freshmen in
the shift from the freshman to the
varsity type of ball, lacks experience.
John Dougert, though giving away
several pounds, sticks right in there
and must be. reckoned with.

Biff Glassford, a veteran with plen-
ty of experience, shapes up as the
outstanding lineman and is expected
to develop into the leader of the for-
ward wall. Glassford, converted from
fullback to guard since his freshman
year, enters his ﬁnal grid campaign
next fall. Dante Dalle Tezze looks
like a good bet for the other guard,
with Raskowsky, Richards, Stark,
Petro, and Walton, in that order, still
very much in the running.

Arnold Greene, at quarter, is lead-
ing the signal barkers at present and
has shown improvement both defen-
sively and offensively. Michelosen,
who comes next, is just about at the
point where he left off last year,
showing little improvement. Bob Mc-
Clure rates third, followed by Howdy
Jackman, a freshman.

Tackles Are Tough

The tackle department looks typic-
ally strong, with Matisi and Delich a
step ahead of a quartet of formidable

linemen in Scnrfpini, Schmidt, and
two freshmen, Lezousky and Merkov-
sky. The latter two still make plenty
of errors which can be attributed to
inexperience. "

Perhaps the weakest position on
the line is the center position. Only
Don Hensley has had‘an‘y experience
of note and this was only in a relief
role to Kliskey, last’ year. ‘Dannles,
a freshman, has a lot to learn, but is
plenty anxious to progress, according
to the coaches. The others with the
exception of Linderman have been
converted. Clem Cambol, frosh full-
back, and Curry, ex-back and end,
a.re now being groomed for work in
the snapper-back department.

Paul Shaw looks best among the
ends, a department that caused plen-
ty of concern before the end of last
season. Frank Souchak holds the
other job at present, but is being
pushed by Miller and Daddio. Adams,
who last fall was converted from cen-
ter to end, rates second to Shaw.

Backfie|=d Gives -Coaches Headache

The coaches have plenty of worries
in the backﬁeld. This concern points
to the fact that there are really only
seven or eight boys competing for
the backﬁeld positions. “A squad
needs at least 10 or 12 boys in the
backﬁeld department," according to
Bill Kern, assistant coach, “if you ex-
pect to give ﬁve or six boys plenty
of offensive experience.” When a.
backﬁeld runs the ball, another quar-
tet must be across the line to offer
secondary resistance

Bob La Rue lines up at right half,
with John Wood, an excellent punter,
Harold Stebbins, and Shea close be-
hind. At the other half, Leo Malar-
key and John Urban have been shar-
ing the assignment equally, with
Goldberg and Trogileon as alter-
nates.——B. B.
