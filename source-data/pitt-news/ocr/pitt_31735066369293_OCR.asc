SGB Pushes Issue
Of Schenley Repairs

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

Student Government Board pres-
ident Josh Baylson, chairing a
Student Affairs Advisory Commit-
tee meeting yesterday, urged the
university to act on proposed
student union renovations.

The meeting was held in the
Schenley Hall room to emphasize
the need for change in- the
building’s structure, Baylson said.

“This is the only room, as far as ‘I
know, on this campus where
students and faculty can sit down
with a cup of coffee and talk. It’s a
noisy place, not conducive to a
social atmosphere. This is a
community lounge and I think it's a
disgrace,” he. commented.

The results of a survey taken in
fall term by 702 students were
distributed at the. meeting. The
survey indicates greatest demand
for a quiet study area, a bar,
overnight facilities for commuters,
additional recreation facilities, a

snack bar and a post ofﬁce in any
renovated student union.

On the question of charging a
mandatory student union fee to
fund the renovations, 39 percent of
those polled indicated they would
pay a fee, 32 percent would not and
29 percent was undecided.

Director of Student Activities
Terry Milani said a total renovation
would cost approximately $13
million, with a deﬁcit of $6 million
existing after university sources
were tapped.

A face-lift renovation, he stated,
would cost approximately $6.5
million and would leave the
structure of the student union
“pretty much the same but in a
nicer fashion.” ,

“My sense of students’ feeling is
that if the building is to be
renovated it should be done
adequately and comphrehensively.
It certainly would be a wise
investment,” Baylson said. .

Inadequate faculty involvement
with programs, insufﬁcientlyt ri-

stated, “We’ve got to do some-
thing and something signiﬁcant
and with non-public funds. A
student union fee is typical of most
major universities. We are going to
have to make a decision about this
(renovations) soon.”

Particularly stressed in the
discussion of renovations was the
proposed overnight facilities.

“Maybe we could get some kind
of dormitory arrangement, but»: I
think we really could‘ not get into a

hotel type of thing where we would
have to charge $20. That would just
be impossible,” Posvar said.

“I think the intent was not
necessary any extensive area, but
just a place where someone could
stay‘ during mid-term or ﬁnals
week, especially during weather
like this where you might have an 8
a.m. final and need someplace to
sleep for an hour or so without
having to use a couch,” said SGB
president-elect Stan Galanski.

Also presented at the meeting

were copies of a proposal prepared

by SGB member Jan Medoff that I

would alter the campus bus
system, which is currently one bus
circling sections of campus every
25 minutes to a two-bus system.

A survey of students on the
campus bus was included with the
proposal. '

The proposal advocates the use
of an express bus from lower
campus to ‘Trees Hall and an

, l

additional bus that would extend

transportation into larger sections
of north and south Oakland.

Medoff said the Cost of the bus
service would increase because of
the addition of another bus and
driverand because service hours
would extend to midnight from the
currentcut-off time of 10:30 p.m.

However, he said, “We under-
stand this proposal would call for

states, “(They) provide excel-
lent service. They react to
every complaint within 30
minutes. They serve both day
and night.” 1

Both of the above comments
are written about the same
realtor.

Sosso said the ofﬁce receives
complaints and pats-on-the-
’back for landlords in equal
numbers.

In ‘regard to procedures that
should be followed when
.1-enting, Sosso said,.“The first
thing students should do when .
thinking of renting is always
take an inventory and have the
landlord sign it. This way if a

window’s broken the landlord
can’t say the student did it.”

If a student does have a

after signing a lease and efforts
to have the landlord correct it
fail, then the Allegheny County
Board of Health’ ‘should be
contacted, she said.

  Conversation
Over Pinball

It was a -surprise last «minute ‘move by Student
Government Board President Josh Baylson when he
switched the location for the Student Activities Ad-
visory Committee meeting from the normally
dignified confines of the Schenley Crogan room to
the chaos of the Student Union recreation room
Wednesday.

The main topic on the agenda was the proposed
Student Union rennovations and, after Chancellor
Weslev Posvar and other dignitaries were ushered in
amidst whizzing pingpong balls and a gaggle of local
pinball wizards that made conversation difficult and
listeningnext to impossible, Baylson made his point.

“This is the only room, as far as I know, on the
campus where students and faculty can sit down with
a cup of coffee and talk,” Baylson said.“It’s a‘"*noisy

place; not conductive to a social atmosphere. This is
a community lounge and I think it’s a disgrace.”
Disgrace is putting it mildly. Resident students
have their dormitories and faculty members have of-
fices. Commuters must struggle along from tables in
the Cathedral to Hillman Library and then study
room in the Student Union. There is no place to
visit, no harmonious surroundings, no place geared
to their needs. There is a sort of Catch-22 in the way
Pitt treats commuters: ‘ they can study in provided
areas, but can’t imbibe so much as a cup of coffee.
They can eat‘or play in the recreation room, but it is
impossible to study there. The university has yet to
put taboos on the Cathedral lawn, but weather poses

_a problem there and regulations on this last place of

refuge are likely to come.

A recent survey revealed that students feel the need
for a quiet study area, a bar, overnight facilities for
commuters, additional recreation facilities, a snack
bar and a post office in the rennovated Student
Union. ' M’  '  I A ’'

Along with Baylson’s last stand came another
breath of hope for student government by way of
President-elect Stan Galanski’s defense of the request
for overnight facilities for commuters‘.
chancellor halfheartedly discussed the issue and said

‘the university “could not get into a hotel type of

thing,” Galanski pointed out the problems com-
muters encounter with inclement weather and finals
week.

Students aren’t asking for a Holiday Inn. But a

his job as head football coach) should be able to of-
fer a student a bed when studies keep him in Oakland
overnight. p i I

It is to Baylson’s credit that he used the outdated
recreation room to illustrate the problem, but we
have yet to see what effect the meeting had on Posvar
and company. ,

The commuter situation has been an em-
barrassment to the administration for years, yet
nothing much has been done. A

With the Student Union rennovations schedule for
sometime in the future, here is an excellent oppor-
tunity for Posvar to right some old wrongs and
correct the situation; maybe not completely, but at
least to recognize the unfairness of t-he present
system.

  Spreading ‘Good News’ With Big Names

' By LAURIE D. T. MANN

During the 1960s,'there was a
away from
organized religion. Clergymen and
women warned that religion in
America was dying. At the same
time, Eastern religions and bizarre

I religious cults very slowly gained a

foothold, particularly among the

‘young. By the end of the decade,

“Flower Children” could be found
panhandling on street corners,

alongside the Hare Krishna con-_.

verts in some big ities.

Now in the 1970s, organized _p

religions have undergone a big
resurgence. Christians of all ages
and most denominations talk about
being “born again.” There are
many_ more religion-oriented tele-
vision shows aired, like the daily
“700 Club” and the “PTL (Praise
the Lord) Club.”

Evangelists are making big
names, and‘ big bucks, -for

themselves on the crusade circuit
spreading the “Good News.”

» Entire colleges, most notably Oral

Roberts University, have been
devoted not so much to a religion,
but to one man’s concept of a
religion. Smaller religious cults
have gotten a great deal of
publicity and in the case of the
People’s Temple, this can hardly
be considered “good news.”

While religion can have its
positive aspects, there also are
many negative aspects as well.
The biggest problem seems to be
the number of people accepting
everything “on faith.” A belief in
God or any deity ought to be the

~- result of an honest inner feeling

and not the result "of external
proddings from either‘ the media
or a streetcorner evangelist. Many

religions, particularly many Chris- I

tian denominations, are guilty of
chauvinism and blatant prop-
agandizing.

Recently,

one concerned Pitt.

student wrote: “I can understand a
person who does not believe in
God, or one who does not believe
that Jesus is God. But there are
many who say that Jesus is one of
many paths to God and yet Christ
himself says that he is the only way
to God.”. ‘ ‘

In response to this type of
statement, it is safe totsay that the
initial source of this information is
the Bible. Most scholars admit that
the Bible can be interpreted in
many ways. These interpretations
can become even more varied when
the Bible is not taken literally. /

When it is

not interpreted

literally‘, individuals often ignore '

some passages, while taking others
to heart. As a result, it is quite
possible for a Christian to believe
that Jesus is just one_of many paths
to God and be “as good” a‘
Christian as the author of those
lines. X

Part of the problem with this

REMNANTS or: THE weos

FRHNKS ewe»

 

‘their need to see

~4

religious resurgence is that many

people are forgetting how to think
for themselves and- are letting
religion think for them. It is easy -to
point the finger at cults for this sort
of activity since Jim Jones is now
infamous. However, major
religions are also guilty of
mesmerizing minds. "

e, In a recent issue of the
Minneapolis Tribune, Sharon Nie-
derman, an author and college
professor, addressed the problem
of students who no longer knew

’ how to think for themselves; they

had given it up in favor of religious
faith. .

Niederman said, “Lest anyone

misunderstand, I am not objecting '

to faith or religious practice. What
shocks me is that students use their
religious fervor as justification for
information
presented in absolutes. ’ ’

If this type of blind faith in

religion-—-as opposed to faith in a
personal God.-——continue, it is
possible society may enter another
“Dark Age” in which all human
knowledge will be bound up in the
ceaselessly parroted books of the
Bible.

Religion today is a big problem
for many people. Some reject
religion out of hand. Others not
wishing to exercise self-deterrnina-
tion, self-reliance and indepen-
dence, throw themselves into
religion without really questioning
their own motives. The rest put
religion into the context of their
lives, questioning certain aspects
that do not make sense to them.

An honest faith in God should be
a growing experience and it ought
to encourage, not censor, intellec-
tual questions on the nature of life,
death and the universe. Indivi-

A duals ought to be able to seek out
their own way, without too much
evangelizing about “absolute
truths.” I

deadline for me in applying to the
school that I chose for my major. I
had to go through considerable
inconveniences to get the require-
ments in on time. Three reference
letters and two transcripts (from
two different schools) were mailed
to the admissions office in Schenley
Hall and never arrived. I know for
sure that all of these were sent
because I phoned the people who
mailed these‘ items and they
assured me they mailed them. On J
Jan. 30. the day before these

required letters were due, they had
still not arrived at,the admissions
office. I spent the entire day going
to each person and asking them to
rewrite their evaluations and
recopy the transcripts. Then I
delivered them personally to the
admissions office.

There are far too many letters
that never make it to their
destination for this to be taken
lightly. After reviewing the
possibilities, it appears to me that
the responsibility falls on the
shoulders of the Pitt mail system.
This problem can not be overlook-
ed, especially when someone’s
education is at stake.

Studio Theatre to Offer Weekly Lunchtime Plays 1

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Entertainment Editor

Last year, Pitt Union Program Council brought in
noontime concerts as a special treat for students. This
year, the Studio Theatre is providing the entertainment
with Wednesday afternoon mini-productions called the
Lunchtime Theatre Program.

The, program, designed especially for commuters and
staff workers will offer something for everyone, according
to publicity director Kathleen, Scuffle, who said the shows
will include musical revues, one act plays and student ﬁlm
festivals. A

All performances will take place on Tuesdays and
Wednesdays in the Studio Theatre, located in the
basement of the Cathedral of Learning. Curtain -time is

12:15 with the scheduled shows lasting no longer than an
hour. ‘

The upcoming schedule for the Lunchtime Theatre
Program is as follows:

“A Couple of Hamburgers,” with “The Subpoena.”
Feb. 20-21. .

“Mrs. Daly has a Lover.” Feb. 27-28.

“Reader’s Theater.” Mar. 6-7.

“Film Festival.” Mar. 13-14.

’ “Musical Revue.” Mar. 2-21.

“To Jiggle the Xerox.” Mar. 27-28.

“Brecht on Brecht.” Apr. 3-4.

The Lunchtime Theatre Program will be an addition to
the Studio Theatre’s spring‘season, which will expand this
year to include two plays. The first presentation, opening
Mar. 14, will be “The Shadowbox,” a Pulitzer Prize winner
making its Pittsburgh debut.

Scufﬂe said the Lunchtime Theatre will showcase the
talents of Pitt students. ‘

“We’re including more musicals this year so we can
feature’ some of the students, ” she said. “Some of the kids
made it to the Civic Light Opera ﬁnals last summer.”

The Studio Theatre is celebrating its 10th anniversary
amidst a renaissance of theater in Pittsburgh, Scuffle said.

“Theater groups in Pittsburgh are not only doing well
but thriving,” Scuffle said. “The studio is probably the
most ﬂexible theater space in the city. The possibilities are
endless. It’s intimate, yet large enough to hold a big
production like ‘Once Upon a Mattress.”’

Scuffle discussed the two plays scheduled for the
Theatre’s debut as “funny but very different.”

“A_ Couple of Hamburgers” is adapted from a short

A story by James Thurber. It deals with a married couple and

a narrator and “it’s typical Thurber,” Scuffle said.
“The Subpoena” is based on a short story by Donald
Barthelme and is about a man and his robot.

“It’s a sort of futuristic piece, funny but not slapstick,”
Scufﬂe said. “Very subtle.”

Scufﬂe said the productions each run about 5 minutes

.. and the gap will be ﬁlled by a mime who will play a

harmonica.
The Studio Theatre is going to be something to watch,”

Scufﬂe said.

Harry Chapin made his annual visit to the Stanley Theatre last nightand d elighted the audience with his ballads.

 

By JIM PANE

Pitt News Staff Writer
Harry Chapin drives more than a
taxi. With a story on his lips, this

charmer of a singer-songwriter

mystically drives one’s sense of
romanticism to its bounds.

- What,Chapin does exactly is to
enchant audiences—such as last
night’s at the Stanley Theatre——is
to immerse them in his music.
With each song, Chapin’s listeners
live a desparate, vicarious life, be it
through .a midnight watchman or a
Midwest launderer, a strutting
father or a neglectful dad, a
morning DJ or a taxi driver. ’

The breadth of Chapin’s char-
acters is equalled only by the clash.
of his intentions. At times he is
didactic; at others, comical.
Sometimes he gushes with irony
and others with pathos. But,
whatever his purpose, Chapin

' ' always is entertaining.

Such songs as “Circle” and
“30,000 Pounds of Bananas” draw
the audience into the act and, more
importantly, build the basis -of the
relationship between Chapin and
his card-carrying fans. He doesn’t
just sing with them; he talks with
them, during and between songs.

And Chapin gives them what
they want, the lamenting “Cat’s in
the Cradle” and the transcendental
“Taxi.”

But he also gives them what they

 Chapn ar Adie at Stanley Theatre  

need, namely such lessons of life as
those in “Flowers Are Red.”
The song is about a little boy who
sees “so many colors in the
rainbow, so ‘many colors in the
morning sun, so many colors in-a
ﬂower, and I see every one”—only
to be bullied out of that idea by his
teacher’s views:

“Flowers are red, young man,
and green leaves are "green.
There’s no need to see ﬂowers any
other way than the way they always
have been seen.

However, Chapin’s best songs,
are ones in which vicariousness
reigns. .. It’s easy to sittback and
become “Mr. Tanner,” live
through his «double tragedy, suc-
ceed with him and fail with him.

In all, Harry Chapin was a suc-
cess. Aided by his longtime
traveling band of John Wallace on
bass, brother Stephen Chapin on
keyboards, Doug Walker on lead
guitar, Kim Scholes_on cello and
Howie Fields on percussion,
Chapin provided three ,hours of
song and story—23 great stories by
one refreshing performer.

Equally refreshing is to see
Chapin exert such effort into a
needy cause: World Hunger Year
and the battle against starvation.
Other richer singers should take
notice, and, as for Chapin, he
deserves a tip:

Harry, keep the change.

Elvis Costello Arms Forces on New Release

By SAM ROSSI

Pitt News Staff Writer

Armed Forces

Elvis Costello and The Attractions-

Columbia V -

After listening to the first few
cuts from Elvis Costello’s newest
release “Armed Forces,” the
listener may get the feeling that

Costello should be dubbed the

infamous man with no conscience.

Costello takes on the most
serious and provocative topics in
his songs and does it with a sneer
and a wry smile.

In one of the album’s better cuts
“Oliver’s Army,” Costello takes a
mockingly sinister look at the

. butchery committed by mercenary

soldiers abroad. Next, in “Senior

. Services” he remarks without a

qualm that he would rather die
than live in a home for the
elderly——not exactly wholesome
subject matter.

Costello, ever the fatalist,

believes bad breaks should be

taken in stride, as he points out in
“Accidents Will Happen.’ '

In “Goon Squad,” he makes
beating, electrical shock and
torture sound attractive and even
appealing when compared to the
crimes on city streets every night.

In “Chemistry Class” a young
girl runs the risk of electrical shock
if she doesn’t acknowledge the
advances of an admirer. “Two
Little Hitlers” ﬁnds a quaint couple
trying to out terrorize one another.

The winner gains supremacy
over his fallen partner, who is
subject to the victor’s every whim.
Only,Costello’s twisted mind could
view love in such a distorted
manner. '

Looking like your basic nerd from

‘the 1950s, Costello gives bizarre

subject matter the attention he
believes it merits through his
music. To a degree, he has
popularized this approach to music.

In addition, Costello has boosted

’ the respectability and appeal of the

nerd’ image he conveys. Heroes do

not exist in his imagery but the
‘anti-hero reigns supreme. In three
albums, the anti-hero has yet to
“get the girl.” Costello would say
that’s appropriate. Why should a
loser get the girl?

He is high on cultural relativism.
He wants the listener to take the
image he presents in context. He
doesn’t ﬁnd the perverse so wierd,

but just different from everything
considered normal.

“Armed Forces" is probably the
weakest album yet released by
Costello. It is a very good album,
but not up to par with his earlier
releases.

“Armed Forces” is the first
album where Costello’s back-up

band, The Attractions, gets atten-
tion. They are a tight trio that
compliments Costello’s lead guitar
and vocal work.

However, it should be noted that

the stoic Costello is particularly

brutal on “Armed Forces,” which
causes one to remark appropriat-
ely, “no'prisoners."

  J ong Opens Poetry Forum

“I may be short, but I write
tall,” said poet-novelist Erica Jong
at the opening of the International
Poetry Forum’s 1979 season at
Carnegie Lecture Hall Wednesday
night.

As a feminist, Jong constantly
explores the theme of womanhood

‘when she addresses the topics of

marriage, childbirth, love, sexual-
ity and women in relation to jobs

’ and the arts.

At the age of 36, she has

published ﬁve books of poetry:
“Here Comes and Other Poem’,”
“Fruits & Vegetables,” “Half-
Lives," “Loveroot” and “At the
Edge of the Body,“ released this

month.

In the newest book, she
introduces new topical dimensions:
personal death, loneliness and
religious introspections.

Her novels include “How to Save
Your Own Life” andthe best seller

“Fear of Flying.” She is currently
working on a large novel and a
collection of essays.

.Iong’s reading revealed her as a
warm, sensitive and sincere artist
who has the talent to make a
transition from irony to seriousness
iii her poems. I
“I’m clear in my writing,” said
Jong. “Even people who normally
have a difficult time reading poetry
can understand mine.”

Pitt’s men’s and women’s
gymnastics teams will both be at
home Saturday. The women will
face William and Mary (8-2) at 2
p.m. and the men will compete
against 20th-ranked Navy at 7 p.m.

The Pantherettes will rely on
Bonnie Tressler, Holly Martino and
Alison Hoburg in the all-around.

According to coach Donna DeMari-
no Sanft, Myra Bachuchin will
hopefully be the other all-around
competitor.

“lf Myra doesn’t go all-around, I
don’t know who will,” she said.

The women are shooting for a
season high of 133 points against
William and Mary, who, according
to Sanft, has scored a high of 127
this season. '

“Although their high score is
only 127, they are still capable of
scoring higher,” she said. “It
could be a tight meet.”

Against Navy, the men will have
to equal or improve on last week’s
record-breaking score of 194.55,
coach Frank D’Amico said.

“Navy has broken 200 already
this season, while their low score
was 190,” he said. “It should be a

close meet, but I put Pitt as a four
point underdog.”

The Panthers will rely on
all-around performers Bob Besong
and Doug Smith, who placed
one-two at Slippery Rock last week.
Allan Meyers will compete in every
event except the side-horse,
despite a wrist injury. Keith
Wipprecht may compete on the
high bars.
Wipprecht is an 8.8-9.0 scorer in

D’Amico said V that '

«   Men, Women Gymnasts Face Tough Navy, William & Mary

that event, but didn’t compete last
week due to an injury.

“Pitt and Navy,” D’Amico sail,
“have developed into great rivals
over the years and the guys are
really psyched. We’ve lost to them
by one-tenth of a point in the past
and really want to go out there and
pull off an upset.

' “We may not pull off a big
upset,” said¢D’Amico, “but we can
give them one hell of a scare.”

Lions, coupled with lengthy.bus

rides to and from this frozen
campus, was a seven-hour waste of
time. .

The Panthers, pushed to poor
performance by a curious Penn
State approach to the game, left
State College with their eighth
consecutive win. For that they
could be 15-8 and happy; nearly
everything else connected to the

contest could better be forgotten. '

The game began with a ﬂurry of
excitement:
grabbed Sam Clancy’s tip and, one
ﬁne pass and ﬁve seconds later,
Sammie Ellis’ fast-break lay-in
gave Pitt a 2-0 lead. It ended with
39 minutes, and 55 seconds of
boring basketball.

Statistics have been sweet this
season to the Panthers, a small
team that has outrebounded and
outhustled its opponents. ‘ But
Wednesday evening was not a good
one for any Panther save perhaps
Ellis, whodid not miss a shot and
propelled Pitt toward victory with a
ﬁve-point spree during the second
half of what had been a close game.

Ellis’ 13 points (four of four from
the ﬁeld, ﬁve of ﬁve at the foul line)
paced Pitt, but ﬁve of those points
allowed Pitt to shake off the
stubborn Lions as the game’s ﬁnal
five minutes approached. Ellis

grabbed a teammate’s missed foul,

shot and scored as he was fouled.
He made the foul shot to give the
Panthers a four-point lead, then
stole the ball and scored again. The
six-point lead allowed Pitt to

‘become patient on offense and

familiar with the foul line.

Perhaps the single notable
statistic produced by the game
involved foul shots. The Panthers
made 30 of 38 free throw attempts
in a poorly ofﬁciated game; the
Lions were seven for nine at the
foul line.

Penn State, a team with little
talent and less conﬁdence, frus-
trated Pitt with a close man-to-man
defense that gave the Panthers
fits—and the foul shots that

allowed them to win a game in
which they made just 12 ﬁeld goals.

Pitt News Staff Writer

An eight game winning streak  '

on the line for Pitt tomorrow night
when the Duquesne Dukes visit the
Field House is a key Eastern Eight

game. The game has been a sellout '

since early this week, and 2,500
Pitt students will admitted on a
first come, ﬁrst served basis. The
game will be televised by WTAE,
Channel 4 at 7:30 p.m.

Much has happened to the Pitt
and Duguesne teams since last
they met at the Civic Arena two
weeks ago. Pitt has continued
winning, while the Dukes have
gone south, losing three in a roe’;
and four of ‘their last ﬁve. The
Dukes are out of contention for the
home court advantage in the
opening round of the upcoming
tournament. A Panther victory
would virtually clinch a top four
spot for Pitt.

Pitt is coming off a 54-45 win
against college basketball’s edition
of the Minnesota Vikings, the Penn
State Nittany Lions. The Panthers
kept their composure in the second
half,

defense while the Lions worked for
a good shot.

While Pitt was winning at State '

College, Duquesne was losing an

 87-84 decision to George Washing-
' ton in Pittsburgh. The Dukes have

been hindered by the “B.B”
Flenory incident poor play from
their upperclassmen (while their
freshmen have played well),'and at
times, disorganized play.

STATE COLLEGE—Weird.

It was as if the Penn State basketball team had just
scored ten points in arow. The fans kept shaking lit-
tle blue-and—white pompoms and cheering en-
thusiastically as the Nitanny Lions passed theball
around. . .and around. . .and around.

“Isn’t this great?” asked one PSU fanatic. It was

one way of staying in the game but it wasn’t exactly a

thrilling exhibition of college basketball.
There is an explanation for the Penn State sup-

porters’ approval of a game plan designed to put '

fewer points on the scoreboard than found at many
high school girls’ games. It seems that a close
slowdown is preferable to a fast-paced slaughter.

“You should have seen this team at the beginning
of the year,” said a student. “Nobody wanted to see
the team get killed all the time. Now it’s a lot better.
We see closer games.”

On the,Run

By MARIA SCIULLO

 

When it was suggested that a quicker pace might
make for a better game another fan replied,” If you
want to watch run—and-shoot, turn, on the TV and
follow the pros.”

After Wednesday night’s sleeper, watching the
preliminary game, and intramural championship,
would have been sufficient.

. >For the second time this year, Sam Clancy was
ineffective against Penn State. Clancy could hardly
be blamed, however; once again he was triple-teamed
by the Nitanny Lions’ answer to the proverbial lint
on a blue serge suit. ' ,

‘This defense might have worked had Pitt been a

one- player team. But, as anyone can tell you (just
ask Mark Haymore of Massachusetts) one fine player
doth not a good team make.

Said coach Tim Grugurich of Clancy, ‘‘He’ll take
charge when he has to.”

Watch out, Duquesne. -

>It appears that few of the big—name Central
Collegiate schools are planning to compete in the
conference’s indoor track and field championships
this weekend. Pitt, along with Penn State and
Michigan State, has dropped out of the running at
Illinois State and will instead travel to Delaware.
> More than a few PSU fans must have been puzzled
by the Rec Hall basketball\program’s roster of Pitt

players that included “Dan Landy-6 foot, 9 inchesm;

160 pounds.” ’

>If the Panthers don’t deserve a standing ovation
when they take the court tomorrow night, no one
does. ‘ '

SPrestiege Missing as Wrestlers Meet Rival Penn State

ByJIMLEWIS
Pit: News Asst. Sports Editor

The heated rivalry between the
Pitt and Penn State wrestling
teams will be lacking Saturday at 1
p.m. in the Field House.

Both Eastern Wrestling League
(EWL) teams, accustomed to
ﬁghting for first place at this time
of year, will be struggling to stay
out of the league basement.

The Nittany Lions, a perennial
Top Twenty team, are 0-11 so far
this season and occupy last place in
the EWL with an 0-4 record prior to
last night’s home match against
Lock Haven (1-2).

Injuries have destroyed State’s
hopes for a third consecutive
league title. Standouts Dan Pfautz
(177) and Sam Sallitt (190) have

1 been injured at some point in the

season and returned to the starting
lineup, while 118-pounder Ray

Frantz and 142-pounder George
Medina are out for the season with
injuries.

Pitt (5-8) isn’t in much better
shape. 1 Jeff Gordon (134), Ed
Bredniak (150) and Steve Gouletas
(142) are all out with injuries and
may not compete in the EWL
Tournament Feb. 24 and 25 at the
Field House. '

“We’re working to try to get a
healthy team on the mat,” Panther
head coach Dave Adams said. “I
think the match will be very
exciting. We can’t afford to lose
any close matches.”

The two teams have already met
twice—in the Penn State Invita-
tional (PSU ﬁnished sixth; Pitt,
seventh) and the Eastern Eight
Tournament (PSU ﬁnished first,
Pitt, second).

“Both teams are very close,”
Adams admitted.

But since those tournaments,
both teams have fallen on hard
times.

“Penn State is by no means as
bad as their record,” Adams said.
“They have the potential to be a
much better team.”

Pitt, meanwhile, clinched a
losing season by dropping all three
matches in the Pitt Quadrangular
-—to Cleveland State (26-8), Navy
(21-16) and William & Mary
(20-18).

“I think we’re a better team than
our record, too,” Adams said.
“When we’re healthy.”

MAT NOTES: Pitt’s ﬁnal
home match of the season will be
against West Virginia next Wed-
nesday at the Field House...a Penn
State loss to Lock Haven could
clinch last place for the Nittany
Lions...Pitt’s EWL record is 1-3.

Women Tracksters Retum to Work at Princeton Relays

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s women’s track team (1-1)
returns to work this Sunday when it
competes in its toughest meet of
the season, the Princeton Invita-
tional Relays.

The Pantherettes relaxed against
Slippery Rock State College last
weekend, defeating the Rockettes
57-34. Conﬁdent that Pitt would
win, Pantherette coach Freda Goff
rested several of her runners so
they would be ready for the
invitational.

However, Pitt cannot afford to
relax this Sunday. The Princeton
Invitational traditionally draws
many of the top teams from the

East, including Maryland, Temple,

Delaware State, and Morgan State,
which placed in the top ten in the
Pitt Invitational several weeks ago.
Because it is a relay champion-
ship, team scoring will not be kept.
Emphasis will be placed on
individual performance. ,

“Next to our invitational, this
will be our biggest meet of the
year,” Goff said. “With the
Eastern championship coming up,
our girls want to improve their
times. This will be a good time for
them to do that.”

The Eastern Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Wo-
men Championship will be held at
Princeton March 10 and 11.

Competing for Pitt this weekend
will be Marie Ribik and Pam
Gearing, high jump; Cissy Wilborn
and Kim Green, long jump;
Carmen Scherich and Peri Jude
Radecic, shot put; Leslie Palmer,

0.60-yard dash,‘60-yard hurdles, and

880-yard relay.

Gwen Murray will run in the
880-yard and mile relays; Lisa
Haupt and Karen Kritchko, mile
and sprint medley relays; Margie
Lee and Melanie Nickerson,
two-mile run; Linda Mitchell,
sprint medley, 880-yard relay, and
mile relay; Jane Strauss, Maria

Panthers 8 owed Down
In Forgettable Victory

(Continued from page 8)

“That wasn’t the defense they,

used when we played at the Field
House,” Neverson ..said. “They
were all over us all over the court.
We had some problems in the first
half (which ended with Pitt holding
a 22-20 lead) because we were
rushing a little.”

“We came into the game
thinking we had to get out in front
quickly,” said Wayne Williams.
“We thought they’d slow it up if
given half a chance.”

Williams, a guard, earned four
rebounds Wednesday night.
That’s not surprising-—-his average
is near that——but it is odd that no
Panther had more. Only one team
in the country-—Alcorn State—had
outrebounded its opponents more
decidedly than the Panthers before
Wednesday night, and Clancy
leads Eastern Eight rebounders by
a nearly insurmountable margin.

But Clancy was scoreless during
the first half, ineffective during the

_, second half and flustered all night.

He finished with 36 minutes
played, six points, four rebounds
and an easily detected desire to
forget Wednesday existed.

“If I knew what was wrong
tonight,” Clancy said, “I could
have corrected it. But I’ll just take
it as a bad game. I got frustrated
early...especially about those
(three) foul calls against me. I

i didn't foul anybody in the first half,

but there I was, sitting on the
bench with three fouls at the end of
the half.”

Pitt coach Tim Grgurich praised
the Lions, who never allowed the

I

more-talented Panthers to pull
away before Ellis’ spurt and who
used a seemingly interminable
final minute to give Pitt a
last-moment scare.

“They played hard as heck,”
Grgurich said, “arid they gave us
our hardest physical half of the
season. That first half was
frustrating.’ ’

PSU coach Dick Harter, whose
offense is patient to the point of
timidity, said his team “played
well)at times but broke down when
Pitt needed key plays.

“Their quickness was one key,”
he added. “They played conﬁ-
dently...unselfishly, especially
Clancy...they just deserved to
win.”

Pitt certainly deserved to win.
Any team that travels to State
College and plays Penn State,
whose hustle is misplaced and
directed toward losing, will deserve
to beat the Lions until Harter
allows his players to play basket-
ball.

Pitt students are reminded that
the Athletic Department has set
aside 2,500 seats for them for the
Pitt-Duquesne basketball game
Saturday, Feb. 17th.

Student seats are on a first-
come, first-serve basis, so students
are urged to arrive early for the
game. The Pitt women host Lock
Haven that night in the first game
beginning at 5:15 p.m., followed by
the men's contest scheduled for

p.m.

Sciullo, and Karen Bradley, two-
mile relay; and Brenda Chorpenn-
ing, two-mile and sprint medley
relays.

Sprinters Haupt and: Murray
missed the Slippery Rock meet
because of leg injuries, but

definitely will compete this Sun-
day.

TRACK NOTES: Radecic will
compete in the Amateur Athletic
Union (AAU) Championship at
New York’s Madison Square
Garden this weekend. The
freshman from Brentwood broke

Pitt.’s team record in the shot put
during every one of her first three
collegiate meets.

Radecic did not compete ‘against
Slippery Rock last weekend be-
cause Goff did not want the
Pantherettes “to run up the
score.” '
