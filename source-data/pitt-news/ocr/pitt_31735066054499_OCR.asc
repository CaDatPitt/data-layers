There are
thousands and

thousands of schol-
arships offered by
private organiza-

tions that go
unclaimed each
year.

At least, that’s
what the compa-
nies that sell schol-

arship books,
materials, and databases say.
Those scholarships are

sponsored by private corpora-
tions, foundations, and organi-
zations, and are available for
many undergraduate students.

However, there is a skepti-
cal part of the population that
feels very few scholarships go
unclaimed and that there is an
uneven ratio between the large
amounts of students applying
for scholarships and the limited
number of them available.

There are many reference
books available in local
libraries that are full of scholar-
ships awarded to students
attending colleges and univer-
sities.

These reference books
state that students can get
scholarship money for things
like being a lineal descendant
of an honored Confederate sol-
dier, having an interest in horti-
culture and plant pathology, or
being the son or daughter of an
employee that works for the
Quaker Chemical Foundation.

But the large majority of
private scholarships award rel-
atively small sums of money,

have very specific require-
ments, and are sought after by
hundreds of students making
them difficult to obtain.

It is also important to note
that when a student notifies the
college or university that they
receive an outside scholarship,
the institution often deducts
that amount from the aid pack-
age they have put together for
the student, or from the schol-
arship the student might be
awarded.

From the university’s point
of view, the student’s need just
got smaller and therefore the
money that was originally ear-
marked for him can be given to
another student who has
demonstrated more need.

“I think private scholar-
ships on an individual student
basis can be a real source of
income,” said Kevin Altomari
of the Office of Admissions and

”'l'ANS'|'AAFI.."

Financial Aid,
“When you look at
the entire student
body, however, the
answer becomes no.
The majority of stu-
dents are relying on
money the
University provides
whether it be need-

ased or merit-
based.”

This money
can come in the

form of financial
aid, academic scholarships, and
athletic scholarships, but it can
also be found within the differ-
ent schools and major depart-
ments of Pitt.

Often times, alumni, mem-
bers of faculty, and private
foundations and corporations
express an interest in donating
money to Pitt for the purpose of
making merit—based scholar-
ships available for undergradu-
ate and graduate students.
Usually scholarships are donat-
ed by individuals to honor a
deceased friend or relative who
was connected with Pitt in
some way while alive.

Many other scholarships
come from private corpora-
tions.

Rosalyn Markovitz, direc-
tor of Development of Arts and
Sciences, said, “We help raise
the funds for the scholarships
by working with individuals,
corporations, and foundations
who want to contribute money
for undergraduate scholar-
ships.”

arships available to students of

President, spoke Sunday at
the Pathfinder bookstore in
the South Side and on Pitt’s
campus Monday night at
Forbes Quad.

Malcolm Jarrett, a social-

Pennsylvania’s 14th district,
said he wants young people
to see the Socialist Party as

  

an alternative. “We want to
build the confidence of the
young, blacks, women, and

Both Garza and Jarrett
said they knew they weren’t
going to win any election but
they wanted to try to make a
difference, because capital-

suffering and corruption hap-

“Do not waste your

Around the World

DUBLIN, Ireland — Responsibility for
Monday’s car bomb attacks at the British
A1my’s headquarters in Northern Ireland
has been claimed. On Tuesday night, the
Irish Republican Army took credit for
the bombs that wounded 21 soldiers and
10 civilians.

' This attack is the first that the IRA
has claimed responsibility for since a
cease—fire was called over two years ago.

Kimberly Smartt, the eighth-grade
honors student who had been expelled

declared that the 10-day suspension she
had served was correct, they reduced her
80-day expulsion to the three days that

1 she had already served.

Erica Taylor, the girl that Smartt
gave the pill to, was suspended for nine
days even though she didn’t take the pill.

sunlight, according to another researcher.

While the research for sunlight’s posi-
tive aspects may be documented and true, the
key is moderation. Too much sunlight may
outweigh the beneﬁcial etfects.

Tanning booths emit two types of rays
(UVA and UVB), much like the sun, accord-
ing to the American Cancer Society (ACS).
The radiation of the sunlamp at the surface of
the skin is much more intense and thus pro-
duces its elfects in a shorter period of time.

The American Cancer Society states
that a small amount of UVB can cause skin
damage, and an excess dosage increases the
chance of skin cancer. Both UVA and UVB
can cause eye damage, although skin and eye

- burns typically occur more frequently with

UVA exposure.

UVA radiation in high doses could also
increase the risk of developing skin cancer
and cause premature skin aging.

Recent studies also suggest that those
who tan in the sun and with sunlarnps have a
higher likelihood of skin cancer than those
who tan in the sun alone.

Ifyou still decide to use a tanning booth,
be sure to use these precautions from the
American Cancer Society:

- Don’t over do it. Just as with natural sun-
light, you must begin with short intervals,
then build up your exposure times.

- Don’t tamper with the timer. The radiation .

THE PITT NEWS

Mayor honors Pitt dean
for dedication and service

   

Some people only get 15 minutes
of fame. Others get a whole day.

Mayor Tom Murphy has dubbed
today “Dean Zoffer Day” in recognition
of the business school dean’s contribu-
tions to the Pittsburgh community. Katz
School of Business Dean H.J. Zoffer
has held that post since 1968 and is the
longest—reigning dean among all major
business schools in the country.

Zoffer, who will retire from his
position this year, is being honored
tonight with a congratulatory dinner at
the Hilton Hotel downtown with school
and administration officials, as well as
business leaders from around the city.
More than 400 people are expected to
attend, according to Sharon Flake,
director of public relations for the
school.

“This is a man who is really pas-
sionate about the school.  This is a
way for people to recognize his service
not just to the school, but to the business
community at large,” Flake said.

Zoffer said the scope of the cele-
bration was a lot broader than he had
expected. He has received recognition

from both the city and state levels.

“It’s very touching,” Zoffer said.
“I’m looking forward to it with some
enthusiasm.”

Since Zoffer was named dean, the
school has constructed a new building,
implemented a new MBA curriculum,
and established an undergraduate busi-
ness school.

Earlier this year, Zoffer was award-

l ed the first Joint Presidential Citation

ever presented by the Board of
Directors of the American Association
of Collegiate Schools of Business and
Beta Gamma Sigma, the national busi-
ness honor society. The award was
based on Zoffer’s 40 years of service to
business and management and his
accomplishments in business educa-
tion.

Zoffer is traveling to Hungary for a
Board of Directors meeting of the
International Management Center. After
that, he’s off to Prague to work with
Pitt’s program with the management
center there. Once he returns, Zoffer
plans to return to teaching and research.

“I’ll be getting myself ready to
harass the next dean the way all the fac-
ulty have been harassing me these last
28 years,” Zoffer said, jokingly.

Scholarship

Pitt can be found within the bulletins of
the different schools on campus, such as
the School of Arts and Sciences, the
College of Business Administration, and
the School of Engineering.

According to Carol Lynch, dean’s
assistant of undergraduate studies, stu-
dents within the School of Arts and
Sciences who have maintained a 3.5
GPA, have obtained between 50 and 90
credits at Pitt, and who have no more
than 30 advance credits from other insti-
tutions are eligible for those’ scholar-
ships funded through the School of Arts
and Sciences.

A computer compiles data and finds

those Pitt students who meet these
requirements and sends them notifica-
tion that they are eligible to receive
scholarship aid together with a bio-
graphical data sheet which asks for the
student’s name, address, current QPA
and GPA, major, and activities they are
involved in. I

Once the student completes the
form and return it to the Dean’s Office
for the School of Arts and Sciences, the
office reviews the application while
paying close attention to the student’s
ﬁnancial aid.

If the student is in need of aid and
shows a level of high merit and achieve-

ment, the Dean’s Office matches the stu-
dent with an appropriate scholarship.

The process of obtaining scholar-
ships within the other schools follows
much the same format. Students inter-
ested in scholarships directly related to a
particular department or major are asked
to speak with their advisor.

Another type of scholarship avail-
able for undergraduate students is
known as an Upperclass Merit

Pitt credits or more with a 3.7 GPA can
apply for this scholarship. Those inter-

possibility of obtaining aid for next year.

While students can turn to private
scholarships outside the college or uni-
versity as sources of college aid, it is
more likely they will find this aid from
their own school.

“The biggest source of college
assistance is the college or university,”
said Margaret Dennis, vice president of
Suffolk College in Wesley, Mass. and
contributor to the Barron’s scholarship
series. “My advice to students is to con-
centrate on obtaining aid through their
college or university, since that is the
better and surer way of securing
money.” '

Boot camp is the
answer for bad kids

The Pemisylvania State Legislature is considering a bill which
would take the state’s responsibility to pay for the tutoring of
expelled students and place it on the shoulders of the students’ par-
ents.

This might sound like a good idea to many taxpayers who don’t
think their tax dollars should pay for this service, but the impact of
completely shirking responsibility for these unruly students is much
more costly than a few tax dollars.

First of all, in the case of families that cannot aﬂord tutors for
their expelled child, no home tutoring will take place. Therefore, the
underprivileged, problem children are denied any chance at further
education after they are expelled from school.

Second, the policy of having expelled students tutored at home
is already too lenient The statement that this sends out is that ifyou
don’t like school, do something to get kicked out. You’ll get to earn
your diploma in the comfort of your own home. The fact of the mat-
ter is that most of these students have no regard for education in the
ﬁrst place.

Anotherproblemwiththecurrentandtheproposedsystemis
that it allows these individuals the opportunity to get themselves into
more trouble. Instead of being in school, they are set loose upon soci-
ety. As these students have already shown themselves to be a prob-
lem, the next logical step in their lives is more mischief and crime.

What Pennsylvania needs to do is to institute a reform
school/boot camp system where students expelled ﬁom public
schools are educated under round—the-clock supavision. If a student
screws up in public school, then more attention should be placed on
that student, not less. However, this attention should not come at the
expense of the students who learn and behave accordingly in public
schools.

It’s four weeks before the elec-
tion.

Do you know where your
party’s headquarters are?

Apparently some don’t —
because I went looking last week

I contacted both the Allegheny
County Democratic and Republican
committees last week to ﬁnd out their
respective locations, so I could check
them out. This politicaljunkie will be
writing a series of columns this term
aboutthecarnpaign, soifanyonecan
tell me where the third parties, such
as the Libertarian or the Refonn par-
ties,canbefound,pleasedroprnea
line at ThePittNewsore—mailrne at
danst11.I’m trying to be fair and get
everyone involved

Fust, the Democrats.

I visited their Smithﬁeld Street
headquarters at around 8:35 last
Wednesday evening, expecting to
ﬁnd the proverbial sea of humanity
scurrying in and out, phones ringing
off the hook, and buttons and bumper
stickers piled high to the ceiling. I had
volunteered for the last three cam-
paigns (and in fact the Democrats
called me this year again, but I had to
beg off for obvious reasons) so I
thought I knew what to expect. (Now,
before you denounce me as one of
those “liberal media” types, I’ve
already said that I do try to be fair.
Heck, my girlfriend and most of my
friends are conservative
Republicans!)

I was, therefore, not at all pre-
pared for what I witnessed — a place
which was all but dead. I cormted just
six people, which included a recep-
tionist and a communications direc-
tor shipped to Pittsburgh from

 

Washington, D.C. And in fact, the
receptionist told me they were about
to shut down for the evening! (As it
tumed out, federal election law pro-
hibits phone calls after 9 p.m., which
may explain the light tumout.)

Anyway, if you believe Andre
Biscoe, the communications director
who once worked for the late Ron
Brown in the Commerce
Department, things are going pretty
well for the Democrats. He said that
the mood was “pretty upbeat right
[then], but we’re not letting up. The
polls say we’re up, but we’re not tak-
ing anything for granted. We’re play-
ing all as even until we actually win.”
He said about Ross Perot, “At this
point, I don’t think [he’s] a major fac-
tor. We’re not really concerned.” (Of
course, the GOP would hope that he
becomes overconﬁdent.)

Biscoe also downplayed poten-
tial scandals concerning the presi-
dent, saying that the voters would
make their choices based on issues
and not on personal morality. He did
admit, however, that “any little thing
[the Republicans] get on him they
will blow up to major proportions.”
For his part, he believed that charges
of impropriety in certain business
dealings against his late boss were
politically motivated, as were allega-
tions from the far right that Clinton
had the plane he was riding in sabo-
taged.
And the Republicans? Well, as
of last week, they hadn’t even opened
a headquarters. The woman I talked
to at the county committee said they
were trying to negotiate a lease for
space in the downtown building
where their oﬂice is located or, if that
doesn’t work out, perhaps out on
McKnight Road in the North Hills. I
guess most GOP supporters don’t

 
   

e explores campaign trail

need public transportation, or maybe
they’re just writing oil‘ the urban vote.
It does seem to me, however, that if
they want to be the inclusive party,
they say they are they should look for
a more central location. As of last
week they were only running a phone
bank in Mt. Lebanon.

As it was, the local GOP sent me
its roster of 23 candidates nrnning for
state and local ofﬁces, and at least
seven of them had their own offices,
phone numbers, and management
staﬂ°.Irecognized some ofthe names
— Mike Fisher of Upperenrst St.
Clair (as my roommate calls it) run-
ning for attorney general; former
Elizabeth resident and current auditor
general Barbara Hafer for state trea-
surer, and fonner Pittsburgh mayoral
hopeful Kathy Matta for the state sen-
ate.Iwouldthinkthat,iftheywere
serious about winning, they would
try to pool their resources. Then
again, many of their more conserva-
tive members likely fear anything
centralized. ‘

You know, one of the major
complaints I’ve heard about the
Dole-Kemp campaign is its organiza-
tion — or more accurately, the lack
thereof. From this viewpoint at this
time, such a description applies quite
well. Indeed, one of my colleagues
here at The Pitt News opined that the
GOP may be conceding western
Pennsylvania — to the chagrin of a
lot of people I know.

More from the campaign trail
next week —— provided there is a
campaign trail to follow. Who
knows? By that tirrre it might be a
campaign swamp, especially consid-
ering the mud already being slung in
the treasurer’s race.

Rick Nowlin hopes to be paid some-
day for shooting his mouth oﬂf

No Midnight
Madness at Pitt

 

College basketball could be the best
sport in the world. Nothing can match the
energy of the NCAA Tournament every
March. Ofﬁce polls abound and the entire
country is wrapped up in the Big Dance.
All of this mayhem begins in rnid-fall,
when the squads reconvene and get pre-
pared for their exhibition games against
the likes of Marathon Oil and groups of
nomads with hi—tops from Yugoslavia and
Turkey.

All of this starts with the Dick V1tale—
bom trend we know and love: Midnight
Madness. Arenas are packed with stu-
dents ready to get a glimpse of their hoop
favorites. There are the Izzy Dizzy race
and the half-court shots to win fabulous
prizes. It’s one of the most exciting times
before the season starts, reality sets in,
and the next thing you know we’re star-
ing at another losing season. That’s all
beside the point. The point is Midnight
Madness attracts attention and gets
school spirit back up.

Sounds great, right? Then why isn’t
Pitt having Midnight Madness this year?

Nobody has noticed the absence of
the Madness promotions at the football
games. The 73 people that stayed for the
entire Temple game told me they didn’t
see anything about it at all. There is no
countdown of days remaining until
Midnight Madness because it’s not hap-
pening.

No dunk contest. No Ralph Willard,
in his best Brooklyn accent, encouraging
the fans to get out and support the team
this year. Willard doesn’t need to give a
speech to make fans go to basketball
games. The girls’ basketball team does,
though, and they’re getting the shaft from
the athletic department. The more public-
ity they get, the better, and what better
way to do it than to put them on the same
bill as the men and draw about 5,000 peo-
ple to Fitzgerald.

The reason behind the desertion of
this tradition is that the first ofﬁcial day of
practice falls on a school night. That’s

 

THE PITT NEWS

It happens, iust ask Temple

Jason Morris

If you missed Pitt’s
come-from-behind victory
against Temple because you
went out to drink with your
friends, you may have seen
the last win of the year. Our
Panthers showed that they
are not yet ready to quit on
the rest of the season, and the
two fans left at the game can
attest to that.

Coming off the heels of
their dramatic 53-52 win
over Temple, our Panthers
(2-4) now prepare for a trip
north to visit Big East foe
Syracuse (2-2) at the Carrier
Dome.

Pitt practiced this week
with the stadium speakers
turned on high volume to try
to deal with the noise they
will encounter at the Dome.

If Pitt is to win this
game, they must find a way
to contain Syracuse’s
speedy, multi-talented quar-

Matt Lytle hopes to work some magic against Syracuse.

Pitt lacks speed throughout
the entire defense. If Pitt
gives up 445 passing yards
like it did against Temple’s
Henry Burris, then you can
just mail this one in.

If Pitt has one thing
going for them in this game,
it is heart. They showed a lot
of it by coming back from a
big fourth quarter deficit
against Temple, although it
is the first time the team
showed any life or heart in
the last three years. They
must build on the momen-
tum of this game to give the
Orange a run for their
money.

They will need all the
heart that they possess, espe-
cially in the secondary. The
leader of that secondary,
John Jenkins, must prove
that he is indeed the true
leader of this unit. Coach
Johnny Majors and the rest
of the staff have said all sea-
son that he is the heart and
soul of the secondary. He’d

terback, Donovan McNabb.
There has been no sopho-
more slump for this guy. _He
was brilliant in their last two
victories against Virginia
Tech and Rutgers, passing
and running his way for

touchdowns galore.
McNabb and the rest of
the Syracuse offense are of
utmost concern to the
Panthers. The Panthers’

“defense” has given up a ‘

whopping 252 points (an

average of 42 points a
game), one of the highest
points—against totals in the
nation. With McNabb’s
throwing and passing talents
this could become a big
problem, especially since

better show it.

McNabb had his way
with the secondary last year
in a 42-10 blowout at Pitt
Stadium. Just imagine what
a more experienced McNabb

More winners and The Voice of the Panthers

    

Some may disagree, but I submit that
the Big 10 Conference is, year in and year
out, the most overrated and mediocre foot-
ball conference in the country. To be sure,
programs like Michigan and Ohio State
have glorious traditions, and Penn State has
deﬁnitely been strong in the Patemo era,
although they really don’t have much of a
tradition prior to that. \V1thout a doubt, the
Big 10 is nothing if not steady. You can
almost always bet that Michigan and Ohio
State are going to be good, ifnot great, and
every couple years an Iowa, Michigan State,
or Illinois will rise up.

But the conference is also spectacularly
unspectacular. For example, no Big 10 team
has won a national championship since
Ohio State has in 1968. And you really can’t
explain the championship drought by saying
that it’s due to the conference teams beating
up on each other, because the Big 10 almost
always gets its clock cleaned in bowl games,
including the Grand Bore of them all, the
Rose Bowl.

Thatbeing said, letmebethe ﬁrstto say

s . . q y . , , — ‘.

tl1atifOhio Stateisn’tthebestteaminthe
country right now —- who is? Don’t let
soores deceive you; the Buckeyes physical-
ly dominated Penn State about as tl1orough-
ly as they dominated Pitt. Ohio State should
be in the NFC East, not the Big 10. The only
obstacles standing between Ohio State and
the national title are a potentially weak
opponent in the Rose Bowl (if Arizona State
loses) and Michigan. John Cooper is 1-7-1
against the Wolverines. VV1sconsin, on the
other-hand, won’t even cause the Buckeyes
to break‘ a sweat. Ohio State 49, Wisconsin
10.

Southern Mi$issippi (4-1) at East
Carolina (3-1) — This game pits two pro-
grams which never get top recruits, never
get on TV, and generally don’t get much
national respect. In fact, two out of three col-
lege football fans don’t even know whether
East Carolina is in North Carolina or South
Carolina (it’s in South). However, these are
two teams with established programs. If you
beat one of them, there’s no prestige. And if
you lose, you’re ridiculed. And you most
deﬁnitely might lose; just ask Alabama and
Georgia, who both have lost to Southem
Miss in recent years. As for East Carolina,
both North Carolina and North Carolina
State have refused for years to play them,
although N.C. State ﬁnally plays them this

Louisiana State (4-0) at Florida (5-0)
— ISU has made enormous strides under
second-year coach Gerry DiNardo, who has
reversed what had become a common trend
on the bayou by stopping the ﬂood of blue
chip recruits from leaving the state. But LSU
is not on Florida’s level, and Steve Spinner
loves to run it up, especially with Ohio State
breathing down his neck. Florida 44, LSU
17.

Washington (3-1) at Notre Dame (3-
1) — If you followed Pitt football in
February 1993, you know that Ron Powlus
was within a whisker of choosing the
Panthers over Notre Dame. In fact, so many
signs were pointing to Pitt that many fans
were shocked when Powlus chose the Irish.
If you’ve paid attention to Powlus’ oom-
ments over the last three years concerning
his experience at Notre Dame, you get the
impression that he feels he made the wrong
choice. You get the distinct feeling that he’s
just not happy. Things will get even uglier
for Powlus in South Bend this week, as the
Irish bow to Washington. First Blue Plate

SU — deep in the backfield

yh/like Kovak

The Orangemen entered the 1996 sea-
son ranked as high as third in some preseason
polls and topped everything in the Big East.

Things have changed for Coach Paul
Pasqualonfs crew after dropping the ﬁrst two
games of the season to North Carolina and
Minnesota. But the Orange (2-2) are 2-0 in
the conference after convincing wins against
Virginia Tech and Rutgers.

Everybody talks about the super-soph
quarterback Donovan McNabb. He’s back
on track and has the rest of the conference
nervous. Against the Hokies, McNabb
rushed for a career—high 127 win.

He’s improved his stats over the last two
weeks. He’s passed for 528 yards and six

 

 

touchdowns for the season and rushed for
202 yards and a touchdown.

McNabb leads a deep Syracuse back-
ﬁeld that sports several gamebreakers.
Tailback Malcolm Thomas is the driving
force, leading the team with 318 yards on 62
carries and four touchdowns.

Last season, fullback Rob Konrad
destroyed Pitt. He hit paydirt three times on
carries of one, 16, and 58 yards en route to a
130—yard, 10—carry performance — the best
rushing performance by an SU back in 1995.
So far this season, he’s rushed for 157 yards
and caught ﬁve passes for 60 yards.

The big play man in the SU backﬁeld
has been Terry Monis, Konrad’s backup.
He’s averaging an extraordinary 13.9 yards
percanyfromthefullbackslottogoalong
with his two touchdowns.

could do to the Panthers at the Dome.

Majors put it as bluntly as one
can put it when describing Pitt’s pass
defense.

“Our pass coverage is highly
porous,” he said.

A Majors did, however, offer some
optimism on the defense after the
Temple victory.

“We played so much better
defense the second half, it wasn’t
even funny,” he said.

Defense is the key for the
Panthers if they are to win this game.
Maybe equally as important is the
play of quarterback Matt Lytle, who
sparked the comeback ﬁlling in for
Pete Gonzalez against Temple. Lytle
completed 12 for 20 passes for 155
yards and two touchdowns.

“I was ready to go. I was in the
ball game the whole time mentally,”
Lytle said. “The only thing that was
going through my mind was to get
the ball in the end zone.”

Majors seemed to agree.

He said of Lytle’s work, “That
was one of the most outstanding
comebacks that I’ve been involved
with. In the locker room, I was still a
little bit dazed and shocked. It
brought tears to my eyes.”

The Orange are a 30-point
favorite in this one. If Pitt is even to
cover the spread, let alone win, they
must once again get Billy West
going. West caught fire in the second
half against Temple and ultimately

‘ scored the winning touchdown. West,
Dwayne Schulters, and Chris
Schneider have all had solid seasons
that must continue against the
Orange to set up the passing game. If
Lytle and the offense are not forced
into numerous third-and-longs, then.
they might have a chance. If not,
Lytle will be seeing those bright
lights in the dome quite vividly from
his back.

Yes, the outlook on this game
does look pretty bleak. However, that
is what we thought when Pitt trailed
52-35 in the fourth quarter against
the Owls.

ence a drop—oll' in the next ﬁve years due to the
fact that NCAA probation has cut the number of
scholarships the ‘Canes can give in half for last
year and this year’s recruiting classes. However,
Miami freshmen are not heavily counted on
anyway, so tl1ey’re not yet feeling the effects of
the scholarship reductions. If you look at the
point spread, you could call a Miami victory an
upset. But I could never call a Miami win at
home an “upset.” Not Really an Upset of the
Week: Miami 22, Florida State 14.

Texas (3-2) at Oklahoma (0-4) —-— When
I was a kid, the Battle of the Red River was the
one big rivalry that I most looked forward to
each year, aside from Pitt—Penn State. Those
two, along with Michigan-Ohio State, USC-
Notre Dame, Alabama—Aubum, and Texas-
Texas A&M, are the most intense rivalries in the
country. The scariest thing about the Sooners’ 0-
4 record is that they’re just starting to get into the
difficult part of their schedule. Oklahoma is one
of those schools that should never have a losing
season, let alone one that is spiraling toward 0-
11. Texas 35, Oklahoma 24.

Arizona State (5-0) at UCLA (2-2) — If
Florida or Florida State go unbeaten and win the
Sugar Bowl, Ohio State would still have a
chance to leapfrog them to Number One by
crushing an undefeated Sun Devil team in the
Rose Bore. UCLA’ s two losses have come
against brutal competition -—— Michigan and
Tennessee — and they trounced Oregon last
week, 41 -22. Looks like an upset in the making.
Second Blue Plate Upset Special of the
Week: UCLA 31,Arizona State 24.

Army (4-0) vs. Rutgers (1-4) — Rutgers’
only win was against Villanova, and they strug-
gled for it. Army is thinking bowl game at 40.
Nevertheless, the Scarlet Knights over the Black
Knights in a minor upset. Third Blue Plate
Upset Special: Rutgers 30, Army 28.

Guest Pick of the Week: Bill Hillgrove,
the Voice of the Panthers. Temple (1-4) at
Virginia Tech (3-1) — Hillgrove is a Duquesne
grad, but the 23-year Pitt play—by—play man is
probably as much associated with the blue and
gold as Tony Dorsett, Mike Ditka, or Bill Fralic.
He also became the play—by—play announcer of
the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1994, working with
legendary color commentator (and former Pitt
News alumnus) Myron Cope. Bill  that
future-Panther opponent Tech is ﬁnally getting
its act together, while recent Panther victim
Temple is likely to be emotionally drained.
Virginia Tech 42, Temple 10.

understandable. Students, especially
student—athletes, need their rest for early
classes.

I have never personally known
someone to stay up much past 10 p.m.
on a school night for anything. Unless I
get 10 hours of sleep, I can ’t ﬁmction
the next day.

Sorry, athletic department, this
excuse just isn’t going to cut it. Do you
not realize the affect that no Midnight
Madness is going to have? No ESPN
coming to town to give Pitt free air
time. No money generated from ticket
sales that are struggling in the Pitt
sport’s area as a whole. No Chris
Gardella soaring through the air and
shocking the crowd with a shortness-
defying slam.

 

What were you thinking? Imagine
the benefit a charity like the Kevin Cecil
Foundation could have from a simple
$2 ticket charge. Think of the advertis-
ers that ﬂock to events like this. What
about the Phantom of the Fieldhouse
contest? Most of all, think of how much
dumber (yes, it’s possible) we look by
not having it. Why not move it to
Friday‘? Duquesne did, but then again
they were able to draw in the first two
rounds of the Eastern region for the
1997 NCAA Tournament, and Pitt has a
hard time getting the Pennsylvania

I’m not quite sure, but I know that
when I’m watching schools like
Kentucky and North Carolina packing
their gyms to the rafters until 3 a.m., the
Pitt hierarchy should keep an eye on
Jamaal Magliore and Vassil Evtimov.
These big men will be wearing Wildcat
and Tar Heel uniforms, re. pectively, on
that night.

They sure would have looked good
in the Panther blue and gold, huh?

he Cher: ore grs
for Grisl1am’s mill

The Chamber

Directed by: James Foley

Starring Chris O’Donnell and Gene
Hackman

In most cases the book is better,
than the movie.

In most cases.

The good thing about the new John
Grisham movie The Chamber is just
that ——- it’s a movie. Even if a Grisham
adaptation is bad, it’s much easier to sit
through a two—hour film than to wade
through 300—plus pages of Grisham
prose.

His stuff is fun —— never that deep,
and never too complicated. But in The
Chamber, Grisham’s material gets a lit-
tle heavier on his audience. At times it
works and is very touching, but he fails
to aim high enough and crashes the
story into the ground.

Chris O’Donnell plays an idealistic
young (you guessed it) attorney trying
to stop the execution of his racist
grandfather (Gene Hackman) for the
murder of two Jewish children. The
title of the movie refers to the gas
chamber Hackman’s character is sen-
tenced to die in, and I guess it’s sup-
posed to hang ominously over every
move the characters make, but it does-
n’t. There’s tension in the end of the
ﬁlm, but more like what you’d find in
an out-of—tune guitar. The audience is
too confused over why O’Donnell
cares so much for this old bigot to feel

 

   

\.

empathy.

The movie fits nicely into the pop-
ular Hollywood notion of execution
(i.e. the critically acclaimed Dead Man
Walking, and the Sharon Stone copy
Last Dance.) It’s a decent attempt by
Grisham to be serious, but he falls back
too soon on the old intrigue devices of
mysterious strangers and secret ﬁles.
From then on the movie becomes a typ-
ical lawyer-on—the-run-with-his—best-
girl flick.

The most powerful scenes occur
while Hackman spits out the wicked
history of his family, and O’Donnell

  Bdhst ill at box

office in Glimmer Man

Glimmer Man
Starring: Steven Seagal and Keenan
Ivory Wayans

Want to see a Buddhist kick
some ass? With prayer beads, deer
penis, and all, Steven Seagal takes
the martial arts to a new religious
plane.

_ This movie was almost as good
as Seagal’s first, Above the Law.
Unlike almost every movie since
that one, we did not find out in the
first five minutes exactly who the
good guys are, who the bad guys

wrestles des— are, or why
perately £"’£ Seagal is
against the E in going to have

notion of being
next in line for that legacy of hate.

The performances are fine (though
O’Donnell plays it just a little too cool
sometimes). Hackman is great as the
gnarled Southern killer and coughs out
his lines like a strange cross between
Strom Thurmond and a grizzly bear.
The character loses believability in the
end, but Grisham is guilty of that, not
Hackman.

The supporting characters are
interesting, but we’ve seen them
before. Faye Dunaway tries really hard
to make us feel sad as the shattered
daughter of the killer. Robert Prosky is
the Santa Claus-like mentor to

CHAMBER, PAGE J7:-mu

 

to kill all of
these people. No, this one actually
has a plot and a bit of mystery. It
could almost be called —— gasp —-
suspenseful!

Keenan Ivory Wayans is pretty
good in this. He adds an ability to
deliver comedy that Seagal hasn’t
mastered yet. Don’t get me wrong:
Seagal has come a long way with
his acting talent. But, well, he’s no
Sylvester Stallone. Then again, per-
haps that’s a good thing.

Wayans and Seagal do well
together, and they manage to do so
without turning this into Lethal
Weapon. They don’t have quite the
chemistry that Gibson and Glover
do, but they have their moments

together.

Seagal has put on a bit of
weight, but he can still put up a hell
of a fight. This film is chock-full of
that most important element of any
Steven Seagal movie: gratuitous
and vicious fight scenes! Agreed,
the fights don’t have the flair and
grace of Jackie Chan’s, but they
are, in some sense, believable.
Once again, Seagal is a highly
trained martial artist with a shady
background, but for once, he’s not
an ex- Navy Seal or CIA agent!

Unfortunately, this movie, like
Seagal’s last three, has shown signs
of the dreaded Hollywood fight
scene cinematography fads that
plague otherwise good action
movies and turn off real action
buffs like myself.

For instance, the shots in the
first fight are reminiscent of the
fragmented MTV rap-video crap
that refuses to hold single camera
angle for more than a millisecond,
and never gives us a wide-angle
shot at all. All we see is a flutter of
hand-waving with some sound
effects to suggest that somebody is
getting hurt. I know that I’m proba-
bly expecting too much —— to be
able to actually see what happens in
the fight scene. This is, after all,
Steven Seagal, a bona fide martial

Atmospheric rockers Jessamine land in Bloomfield tonight

This week Jessamine is on the
cover of CM], and tonight they are in
Pittsburgh. You can catch them on
stage at the Bloomfield Bridge
Tavern, and here’s why you should:

Jessamine is from Seattle, but
they are not otherwise associated
with that scene. Instead the band is
linked to the Chicago label Kranky,
which put out two of their albums.
Recently, Jessamine did a split 7”
with Flying Saucer Attack, and in the
past has collaborated with Sonic
Boom’s band Spectrum. Besides
these musical associations, the group

* .~,'\,f it-;.-. ‘-

has been compared to Stereolab and
Can because of their ambient and
atmospheric nature. This description,
though, only assesses one dimension
of Jessamine’s sound. The band
maintains a rock drive and the struc-
tural aspects of their music are
formed by intense dynamic shifts in
the mood of the sound. Bassist Dawn
Smithson grounds this sometimes-
improvised music and supplies the
music with wispy vocals. She is
accompanied by guitarist/vocalist
Rex Ritter, drummer Michael Faeth,
and electronics master Andy Brown.

Brown acts as the band’s lifeline,
creating various sonic titillations
with keyboards, a moog, and an
oscillator.

If witnessing this orgy of
ambiance, rock, and electronics live
is not enough to get you to the BBT
tonight, here are two more reasons:
Storm and Stress and The 1985.
The innovative sound of Storm and
Stress has recently caught the atten-
tion of Steve Albini, who will record
their upcoming album. Although it
may come across as improvised,
their music is highly calculated and

W5".

7'1:

structured. Guitar and drums work
together (or against each other) to
create intense rhythmic tension while
the bass sound moves simply in order
to anchor this musical experience.
The 1985 is another local act which
has been described by two fans as
“monster rock” and “animals who
got their hands on electricity.”
Enough said.

The show tonight is in Bloomfield on
Liberty Ave. (54C) and starts at 9
p.m. Cost - $6. 682 - 8611

Chamber

O’Donnell, and even Bo Jackson steps
into the camera for a while as a death
row security guard. It’s fun to see him,
but he still looks like he’s practicing his
lines in front of a mirror.

Director James Foley weaves them
all together nicely, but some characters
seem out of place, like they walked in on
the wrong scene. Foley works the ﬁlm
best during the ﬂashback sequences, but
only lets the power of those scenes
transmit to the present action a few
times. His cramped prison scenes work
well, often focusing the action directly
on the eyes of the two main characters.
But as the young protagonist zips from
city to city in search of secret files,
Foley’s sweeping panoramic views of
Mississippi look more like overblown
car commercials than anything else.

The movie is ambitious but never
gives us all it’s got. The Chamber is bet-
ter than most Grisham film adaptations,
but it becomes so typical of his other
work you half expect to see Tom Cruise
or Julia Roberts running away from
other Grisham hoods in the background.

The movie rolls along quite nicely
in the beginning, but seems to give up
(dare I say die?) by the end. The actors
do their best, but with the material they
have to work with, the only real surprise
is why they don’t give up, too.

'l'I-IE PITT NEWS

Here is a suggestion for the alt-
interested and for those whose knowl-
edge of artistic happenings is limited to
what is going on at the Warhol: go to
METAL ORGY. This is the exhibition
that can entertain anyone -- art by
emerging national artists for the intel-
lectual, and pure visual stimulation for
the sexually-absorbed.

ROY and Steve Mendelson are the
curators of this exhibition at the
Mendelson Gallery which runs until
November 2nd. Artists from around the
country were invited to interpret the
unusual theme of eroticism and metal, a
concept that lent itself to be represented
broadly. Works range from the blatant-
ly pornographic to the subtly sensual.

Erotic pieces from the gallery’s private
collection are also being shown, which
adds to the multimedia nature of this
exhibition. Everything from sculpture
to photography is accounted for, and by
the close of the show literature, film,
and performance art will have played a
part in this art orgy.

You already missed the highly
attended and successful opening at
which Jennifer Boughner presented
Nude Transcending a Staircase, but
you can still find a yard of her white
hair on the staircase which she disem-
bodied during this art performance.
More erotic events are also scheduled.
On Wed., Oct. 16th there will be an
open mike for erotic readings from 7 to

‘I7

 

9 p.m. The following Wednesday (Oct.
23rd) will feature erotic films, several
of which may be sexy enough to
deemed worthy of the title “porn.”
Here’s your chance to watch what
might otherwise be branded as “XXX”
under the guise of art.

The Mendelson Gallery is located
at 5874 Ellsworth Ave. (take the 71C)
and the hours are Wed. through Sat.
from 12 to 6 p.m. or by appointment
(phone: 361-8664). Take your signifi-
cant other - or better yet, potential sig-
nificant other to this show and enjoy an
art event that has a refreshingly loose
and unpretentious atmosphere.

Eels
Beautiful Freak
Dreamworks/Geffen

The video for “Novocaine for the
Soul” may have pushed Eels into the realm
of mainstream popularity with frequent and
repeated MTV airplay, but in truth, the band
is everything that MTV is not.

The beauty of Beauaﬁtl Freak comes
from the melding of the intense heartfelt
lyrics and a sound that can be best described
as pop—grunge. It has a folk—rock feel, yet it
retains many inﬂuences from the Seattle
sound of the early ‘90s. It is as if Tori Amos
and Nirvana were blended together.

Beautiﬁtl Freak is an exploration of
softly played guitars, fat bass lines, catchy

THE PI'l"I' NEWS

drum loops, and synthesized strings. All of
this is mixed together with the insightful
and intelligent lyrics of E, the singer and
guitarist. S

E’s lyrics show a world where not
much is right, but he attempts to examine
the beauty that is under the surface.
“Novocaine for the Soul,” the song popu-
larized by MTV, shows the persistent theme
behind Beautzﬁrl Freak. Throughout the
song, E complains about the complexity of
life.

“Life is hard, and so am I,” he sings at
the beginning. “You better give me some-
thing, so I don’t die.” E’s cure -——— his “novo-
caine” — is love. “Oh my darling,” be con-
tinues, “will you be here before I sputter
out?” By the end of the song, the first line

43:.

has changed, “Life is good, and I feel great,
‘cause Mother says I was a great mistake.”

Beaatzﬁtl Freak examines the dirty,
freakish side of life and then pulls out the
beauty. It is one of the few albums where
the lyrics are as important (perhaps even
more) than the music itself.

E examines life’s harsh reality on songs
like “Susan’s House,” with spoken words
over a drum loop and heavy bass riff.
Throughout the song E speaks of the many
problems of the world. He sees a boy who
has been shot, a kid selling crack, and a
teenage mother:

“Here comes a girl with long brown
hair who can’t be more than seventeen,” he
says. “She sucks on a red popsicle as she
pushes a baby girl in a pink carriage. And

I’m thinking, ‘That must be her sister. That
must be her sister, right?’ They go into the
7—ll and I keep walking.”

The song continues to dwell on these
themes, and he ends up looking for solace
with his love. “Going over to Susan’s
house, I can’t be alone tonight,” he sings.

Although the lyrics are what makes
Eels great, their sound only magniﬁes and
intensiﬁes them. There is a simple feel to all
the tracks, but the simplicity is what magni-
fies the intense lyrics. The grunge—like
inﬂuence that overlays the basic, almost
music—box quality, adds grit to E’s lyrics.

Before he joined up with Butch, the
drummer, and Tommy, the bassist, E had
two solo albums, A Man Called (E) and
Broken Toy Shop. Those albums never gar-
nered as much attention as Beautijitl Freak,
partly because the sound never truly
matched the lyrics. The inﬂuences on E’s
solo albums dwelled more in the Britpop
area of bands like XT C, the Beatles, or
Squeeze. As a result, his lyrics never truly
shined as they do with Eels.

In fact, I once owned Broken Toy Shop,
but I sold it to a used CD store, never notic-
ing the lyrics. I thought it was just an aver-
age album. After experiencing the insight
and charm of Beautiﬁtl Freaks, I’m consid-
ering picking up another copy of Broken
Toy Shop, to try to hear what I might have
missed the first time.

D3: The Mighty Ducks
Starring EMILIO!

I saw the preview for D3: The
Mighty Ducks and thought to myself,
“There is no way they made another
one. Sure, the first one was good and
the second one was alright, but a third
— that is just too much quacking.”

Until I saw it for myself. It lacked
the humor that the first one possessed,
but for once, it was a sequel that
offered something different. It didn’t
have Emilio Estevez jump behind a
bench to coach a bunch of rejects to
the championship. It put someone else

After admitting the Ducks into his
old high school with full scholarships,
Gordon Bombay (Estevez) takes off
on a job with the junior Goodwill
Games, and leaves the team with
another coach. The varsity squad of
the school is very disappointed about
this because the school’s admitting
them was all a publicity stunt and
plans to make their lives a living Hell.
The Ducks now have to adjust to
mature high school life and a bitter
varsity team without its leader. As if
that wasn’t enough, they also have to
give up their name and be called the

protege and hero of the first install-

coach and begins to rebel against the
squad, until Gordon shows up to show
him the way. When the squad pulls it
together and learns how to play more
“defense,” the Ducks fly again.

As much as I did enjoy the new
Ducks, there are some negative points
to stress. One is that I was in an audi-
ence with a large group of small chil-
dren, and there are some jokes that
they wouldn’t get, so they were sound

D3 was interesting, but could use
some improvement. I like the fact that
it was a different theme and plot
because a conforming theme would
have made the third movie a “dead
duck.” Also, I am sorry to say these
kids do not handle maturity well. They
still insist on being Ducks and staying
together. It’s called growing up, and
they need to do it. I would hate to see
these kids in college.
