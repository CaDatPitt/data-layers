Ph.D. at Pitt. He did his under- ‘

graduate work at Pitt as well. In

chairman of the Department of
Physics and was largely respon-
sible for the steady growth of that
department. It was under his lead-
ership that Pitt was awarded

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

In ‘3rd Annual’

by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, The Pitt News

Disciplinary action will be tak-
en against eight University stu-
dents as a result of theiractions
during the panty raid Tuesday
night.

Initially, the heads of the Hous-
ing Office issued letters to four
males four females informing them
that they would be suspended from
the dorms in 48 hours, but that
they could appeal their cases to

_Dean of Students Donald Pease.

The students met with Pease
Wednesday, and he listened to
their stories and asked them to
return to see him on Thursday.

Yesterday morning, Scott Baum
and Sy Adler, representing Stu-
dent Government and the Legal
Awareness Committee, met with
Pease and urged him to refer the
cases to the respective student
Judicial Boards, and to inform the

~ students of their rights to appeal

 _ I   8 ‘Panty.Raiders’Disciplined    

the decision of these Judicial

~ Boards to the University Review

Board. -

Pease said that he had already
decided to refer seven of the eight
cases to the Student Boards. He
added that the one case dealt with
the Men’s Dorm Council Judicial
Board, and since it has not yet
been completely established,
he upheld the decision of the Hous-
ing office. ‘

Alder and Baum later met with
Pease and Jack Critchfield, Dean
of Student Affairs. During’ the
meeting, Baum expressed a de-
sire to hold the Judicial Board
meetings next week, in order to
give the students time.to prepare
their cases.

Pease replied that it was up to
the individual Boards as to when
they would meet, but indicated that

6 as students, Baum and Adler could

petition the Boards to hold their
meetings next week.

‘Peace Movement

Ziferstein

by HARRIS MILLER
' Staff News Reporter

‘Dr. Isadore Ziferstein, leading,
psychiatrist and psychoanalyst,
during his noon lecture in the S.
U. Wednesday,_ “The” Vietnam
peace movement is in great dan-
ger of beingcaughtasleep at the
switch.” - _

Before a crowd of 75, this lead-
er of the peace movement out-
lined his view of present involve-
ment by the U. S. in Vietnam. His

House Approves   A
Bill Lowering  

-Voting Age to 19

The Pennsylvania State House,
of Representatives has approved
a bill whichwould lower the
legal voting age in this state to
19. »

Indications in Harrisburg are
that the state Senate will also
approve the bill. The Senate has
previously suggested a lowering to
age 18. .

Sen. Robert D. Fleming (R-As-
pinwall) said he would accept the
bill, despite his earlier sponsor-
ing of a bill to punish students
causing campus disturbances.

According to Fleming, the en-
tire Senate would probably. pre-.
fer the 19-year age.

Many legislators feel that, since
many 18-year olds are still in high
school, they are not mature enough
to assume voting responsibilities.

Most of the debate on the bill
in the House was centered around
the question, “If persons under
21 may vote, should they also-be
permitted to enter into. contracts
and drink?” . .

The bill was approved" by a vote.
of 158-37, Only 102 votes were .

\"

'1".

 

Analyzes

speech, entitled, “Psychological
Habituation_ to War,” was bas-
ically taken from a pamphlet which
he authored two years agounder

.the same title.

The pamphlet has .achieved-

great importance in the peace move

ment. Soon after it was written,

former Senator Wayne Morse en-r
tered the contents of -the pamphlet

into the Congressional record. All

in all, over 35,000‘ copies of the

article have been distributed

throughout the world. '

Dr. Ziferstein first pointed out
that‘ according to public opinion

polls, Americans’ opinion of in-
volvement in Southeast -Asia had
changed drastically in the twelve

.years from 1954 to 1966., Accord-,

ing toguziferstein, while 70‘ per

,-cent of Americans opposeddirect -

intervention in 1954, over 70 per
cent supported intervention in 1966.
This ‘was achieved by “several
public relations techniques employ-
ed by our government.”

Ziferstein went on to say that
the most important technique was
psychological habituation — gradu-
ally escalating our involvement
while continuously ‘convincing
the American public that the gov-
ernment is right. The end result
is to Ziferstein that “We are en-
gaged_in a war without‘ knowing
when, how, or why it began.

Two other techniques were also
outlined by the doctor. The first
is news management; or as Zifer-
stein prefers, “Lying to the peo-
ple.” The second is confusion and

‘manipulation of public opinion.

“President Johnson leaked a rum-
or about troop increases, came out

publicly "and denied the rumor, v

and while everyonewas breathing
a sigh of relief,_ slowly escala-

ted -our,-troop strength until. it’ ,

reached. the rumored level,” Zifer-

;  .lastt_echniqu_e1."  , z 

movement is

stein‘ said’ in‘ ‘explanation of this ‘I '

 
 

In response to Baum’s request
that students be informed of , .,
their rights in the initial state-"V"
ment from the Housing Office, .
Critchfield agreed and said that-
he would bring the matter to the .
immediate attention of the Hous- - 
ing Board officials through a -if
letter. 

    
  
   
 
   
  
  
   
  
    
  
   
    
   
  
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
     
   
   
  
  
  
    
  
   
  
  
  
   
 
   
    
  
   
    
 
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
     
   

Pease noted that the reason he I
waited a day to refer the cases‘ 
to the student Judicial Boards
he was informed that the ,Wo—_'*"‘
man’s Housing Board indicat-.31
ed that they didn't care to hear _the ’
cases, and "would uphold the de- .-
cision of the Housing Office.

The Womans’ Housing Board. _
met with Pease yesterday, ,.at,..-.
which time he indicated that he_,f_elt 
they should hear the cases. They‘ .~
agreed, and the cases will be

heard sometime in the future. '1,

iTo Blind School

‘,-In contrast to some of the
.;‘unfavorable publicity gen-
erally given to college

stu-
dents, the students of the
School of Engineering did a
good deed -Wednesday. With
the funds accumulated from
.Engineer’s Week, the engin-
- eers donated over $2600 to the
. Western Pennsylvania School
for the Blind.

, The money was raised by
service projects, which was
part of the competition between

 the nine departments in the
 school.

 ‘The service projects were
designed to be both amusing and
money-making. The CE’s dres-
sed up one student as a gorilla,
and had two organ grinders
carrying small cups. A pancake

1 marathon was held by the IE’s,

. andthe Chem E's set up a booth

-' where students could throw pies

. at their beloved professors.

_- The money was presented to

Dr. Alton G. Kloss by a dele-
 gation which ‘included Max

eer’s Week, Dean Hoelscher,

Why TWA? V

Because we have more ﬂights going to
where you’re probably going during the
summer, than any other airline.

That means you can leave when you want
to leave—not when someone tells you it’s
your turn to leave.

Call_TWA, your travel agent or the TWA
campus representative.

TWA .

The things we'll do to make you happy.

_ TWA will fly you to the language of your
choice.

Your teachers will be waiters, waitresses,
bartenders, barmaids, shopkeepers, bellboys,
chambermaids, hotel clerks, policemen, cab
drivers...and just plain and fancy natives.

You‘ll do more than learn a language.
That, you can do through text books.

You’ll learn how to communicate with that
language. __

1 What language do you want your forte to
be? French, Italian, German, Swahili,
Spanish, Portuguese, 'Greek???? You name it.
And TWA will ﬂy you there for your summer

7313!’. Wesley W. Posvar
Chancellor 4~
106 Cathedral of Learning

Dear Dr. Posvar:

. Several months ago I wrote
-you to convey my pride for the
University in the statement you
made regarding our responsi-
lbilities with respect to the Black
community; again in January I
felt similar pride in your forth-
right response to the B.A.S. ac-
tion at the computer center.

§,_,Unfortunately I am unable to
find any way to feel approval,
let alone pride, in your public
statements during the recent fast
and “free university” activities.
,1‘ would like to refer specifically
to the-reports in the news me-
dia of your statement upon ac-
cepting the petition from stu-
‘dents in the School of Pharmacy.
’_'First, in accepting the state-
ment from Mr. Doperak, you also
accepted the implication that the
‘validity of criticism can be meas-
ured by the fraction of a consti-
tuency which voices it. You fail-
ed to saythen in that public con-
text what you have previously
siad: that the dissenters, re-
gardless of style, are raising many
important issues of educational
content and method. You know
this; you know that failing to
state 2 it then left the clear pub-
lic impression that the serious con-
cerns of the group who partici-
pated in an “open university”
were no more than a “pain in some
part of the anatomy.”

Dear Taxpayers of Pennsylvania:
Thank you for the $2,000.00

;Daytona Beach.

iyou could join me. '

     

Secondly, you also accepted by
what Mark Twain called the “si-
lent lie” the implication that the
Concerned Students and Faculty
had in fact “disrupted” the func-
tions of the University. Again, you
had ample means to know that
this was not so. Perhaps the state-
ment by Sam Hays is the clear-
est expression of the facts, but

Messrs. Critchfield, Freeman,
and Pease had all been much
earlier eyewitnesses.

In short, it seems to me that,
presumably while attempting to
“defend” the University from un-
enlightened misconceptions held
by the public and by legislators,
you have actually strengthened
these misconceptions and thereby
weakened the University’s ability
to define its own role in a gen-
uine process of education. How
much stronger your position and
the University’s had you stated, as
soon as it became clear to you,
that the administration welcomes

creative activity and responsible '

action and had sent members of
the administration to meet with
the fasting group — not to read
ultimatums, but to join in a two-
way discussion of the issues on
their merit.» No confrontation
then, no injunction, but an ac-
ceptance of what Josh Chasen
has called “accountability,” a
concept sorely lacking through-
out our mass society.

In sadness,
David F. Bramhall
Professor of Economics

by WILLIAM HANKS
Instructor of Speech

Today several teachers at

the University of Pittsburgh
were forced to ‘dismiss classes
as unidentified but highly or-
ganized bands of students blared.
rock and roll music from the
Patio of Schenley Hall
and milled about the lawns, block-
ing sidewalks and building en-
trances. Some ran chariot races
down Bigelow Boulevard, which
they had barricaded, blocking
‘normal traffic between Forbes and
Fifth Ave. Other students, some
wearing crew-cuts and ties, shout-
ed in unison, taunting students
trying to pass through the crowds
on their way. to classes. I

This apparently was the first
disturbance of any size and ser-
iousness-on the University cam-

pus. Earlier gatherings of stu-
dents prevented no one from free
access to class, reliable sources
here said. These sources also in-
dicated that the pruposes of earlier
demonstration occuring in the
Cathedral of Learning and in the
Common Facilities Building
last week had the clearly announ-
ced purpose of discussing Uni-
versity policies. The function of
today’s disturbance remains
cloudy to administration offi-
cials, students, and teacher trying

to continue the normal process of
orderly classes.

ONE INSTRUCTOR FROM the
Department of Speech was seen en-
tering his office hurredly at
about 11:20 a.m. today. He said,
“I finally just had to give up —— I
couldn’t hear the students and
they couldn’t hear me with that
damned noise outside. It’s a hell

terested in creating a disturbance
than they are in getting educa-
tion. I just don’t know what some
of these people came to college-
for.” ‘

This reporter questioned sev-
eral students standing on the
curbs, separated from their class-
rooms by the speeding chariots.
One dazed co-ed said, “I just
didn’t believe it would happen
here. I know many of these kids
and they are nice people at heart.
I just don’t know how they could
get so stirred up and act so wild.
I’m sure there are a lot of out-
side agitators here too.”

Analyst Diagnoses National Psyche:

‘Psychological Habitua tion To War’

by MIKE EDELSTEIN
Staff Feature Writer

The secretary of the ritzey California
psychiatrist’s office enters the room and an-
nounces the patient to the Psychiatrist. The
United States of America, the patient, enters the
room and, at the Doctor’s suggestion, sprawls
out on the couch.

“Now then, Mr. and Mrs. America,” the an-
alyst begins as he looks up from a file marked :‘Clas-
sified: Vietnam File,” “We are going to probe your
past history and try to locate the source of your
problem.” I

Putting on his reading glasses the analyst shuf-
fles through a mass of documents and pulls out the
relevant material. “Now would you mind going in-
to more detail on this French affair in 1954.”

Sometime later, the intricate chain of occur-
ances has been fully deliniated. The exhausted
patient lies sprawled out on the couch. The Doctor
walks out to the receptionist who inquires of the
patient, “What's the matter?”

‘ The answer“Psycho1ogical Habituation to war.”

I

The above situation is not very farfetched for
Dr. Isidore Ziferstein, well-known Psychiatrist who
spoke here Wednesday. As Ziferstein himself ex-
plained it. “In 1954 a Gallup poll showed 72 per
cent of American people were opposed to U. S. in-
tervention in Vietnam. In 1966 and 1967, with sev-
eral 100,000 troops in active combat, the Gallup poll
showed 70 per cent of the American people either

’ supported or didn’t oppose the war. I set about as

a behavioral Psychologist to find out how this mir-
acle of a 180 - degree shift in American opinion
was achieved.”

The results, as revealed by Ziferstein’s investi-
gation, are set down in an article, Psychological
Habituation To War: A Sociopsychological Case
Study, which appeared in the American Journal of
Orthospsychology in April, 1967, show a careful
collection of convincing political happenings.

I The danger is that lack of success in the Paris
Peace Conferences and increasing activity in Viet-
nam will allow the administration to make all-out war
in Vietnam. According to Ziferstein, this has been
the goaliin Richard Nixonfs “Goldwaterian Heart”

since his days as Vice-President.’

Graduate Education Council Tackles Apathy

by COLLINS DE’ARTH
Member, International
Education Program

The Dean of the School of Ed-
ucation has been advised far more
than two years by a Council sup-
posedly representative of the
graduate students in the School of
Education.

This academic year has seen a
number of significant changes
both in the composition of the
Council and in the issues with
which the Council feels it should
become concerned. Some succes-
sful attempts have been made to
involve graduate students them-
selves in the Council member-
ship selection process. In certain
programs students now elect their
own representatives to the Coun-
cil.

Proposes
 Solutions

by DAMIN E MARTIN
Staff News Writer

In conjunction with Project
Point—Blank, Issac Greene deliv-
ered an address Tuesday on the

Black man’s view of God.

Speaking before predominant-
ly white audience in the Common
Facilities Building, Greene
stressed that in the past, society
placed too much emphasis on the
spiritual needs of man and ignor-
ed social conditions. He feels,
however, that the Modern Chris-
tian Church can merge with so-
cial reform movements to effect
real social change. Quoting from
the Bible, he said that “Where
much is known, much is re-
quired.” Now that we realized
what social change is needed,
it is required of us to initiate
that change.”

Greene also expressed his be-
lief that Christianity specializes
in reaching the spiritual life
of man. “Unless mankind is ful-
filled in its spiritual relation-
ship with God,” he cautions, “we
will always have violence.”
Greene elaborated this point by
noting that the only restraint on
violence or transgression is a spir-
itual relationship with God.

The Point-Blank speaker end-
ed his address with his personal
three point formula “for Chris-
tians to try in order to bring
about a better America and solve
social problems.”

His first point was that people
should try to accept others
as they are. Nothing that in the
United States acceptance is not
a general practice, Greene feels
that this has led to segregation.
“Accepting others,” he em-
phasized,” is the first step toward
constructive change.”

Loving people is the second
step Greene outlined. “Man
is never free until he is in love
with people,” he said. “The foun-
dation on Christianity itself is
love.” Greene then expressed his
admiration of the late Martin
Luther King’s love of human-
ity.

Finally, Greene looked to ser-
vice as a third way to effect so-
cial change. He stressed that one
of the greatest ills of segrega-
tion is that it inhibits some from
serving manking. “If young peo-
ple really aren’t committed to
service,” he warned, “they won’t
find happiness or fulfillment.”

 

  
 
 

is a sample of what has been dis-
cussed recently in Council, in com-
mittees and informally among
members.

Urban education

Selection process for students
in the school.

Student representation and in-
volvement in decision making.

Faculty and administrative

personnel.

Problems of particular students
and groups of students.

The Council is beginning to
feel and act as though it is some-
thing more than an appendage
to the establishment. However,
it does have grave problems, in-
cluding one of identity. No one
is bound to recognize its decis-
ions and recommendations. In ef-
fect it can be regarded by the
Dean, if he so wishes. as a “not
responsible,” or inconsequential,
body.

No one in the Council, in-
cluding the Chairman, is con-
tinouously a party to what de-
cisions are being made in the
School of Education. Certainly,
the Council has infrequently
been involved in the decision-
making process even where policy
decisions will vitally affect stu-
dents.

Each program, and there are
nineteen programs, within the
School has its own particular stu-
dent problems and own “culture”
some programs, particularly small
ones catering for full—time stu-
dents may not have problems of
student — faculty - administration
communication. Large programs
oriented part-time students cer-
tainly do have this problem. In
this latter situation representa-
tion without some sort of student
cohesiveness is difficult.

As this stage the Council
could aim at securing strong stu-
dent organization at the pro-
gram level and act as a federal-
type institution. It could have a
dual role in this capacity: as a
“court of appeal” for students
not able to settle problems at the
program level and as a coordina-
ting body for programs having
common problems.

»VVvvvvVVV

"r V going to school

Providnig there were no over-
tones of a subordinate superordin-
ate relationship, many Council
members could accept a federal-
type arrangement. Certainly,
strong program student organiza-
tion should enable members to
communicate with the bulk of the
Schools scattered 2,300 students.

If the Council should wish to
assume the role of a Consultative
body information must be sup-
plied by the Dean. Unless the
Council is specifically allowed or
directed to play some part in
the decision making process it
would, in this situation, merely
have an opinionative role.

Another consideration is
whether the Council should con-
cern itself with matters which
directly concern the School and
the University or with matters
which are of national and in-
ternational concern.

In terms of student's imme-
diate interests, it might be wise
to deal with a few specific
problems, such as the abolition of
the Miller Analogy test for ad-
mission, or the resolution of the
Cole demands.

This then raises the question
of time perspective. If Council
members see themselves as in-
itiators and anticipators of
change, they would do well to keep
their fingers on the universal
educational pulse and observe
what is happening on cam-
puses in California, New York,
Paris, and Berlin.

Finally, the Council would
do well to look at itself in terms
of a liaison role. Concretely, it
could examine its position on var-

with that of student government
and faculty and administrative
councils or committees. The coun-
cil recently established inter
locking membership with the fac-
ulty Urban Education Commit-
tee.

It might be, if adequate lia-
ison can be established both in
terms of information and per-
sonnel exchanges, that the Coun-
cil will be more patent than if it
maintains its current lonely
stance. It can definitely achieve
more by acting in concert with‘

other groups in action programs
than it has in the past.

The implicit assumption in the
article is the existence of apathy
in the School of Education gradu-
ate Council. This article has at-
tempted to suggest ways of
strengthening Council in terms
of student participation, repre-
sentation and direction. It is a sad
comment on the whole education-
al system, however, when stu-

.dents seem to have no interest in

policies which have great signifi-
cance for them.

...And The Real University Community

The ghetto is dark and deserted tonight. Only a few young
prostitutes loiter on the corners awaiting customers, until the shrill
siren of a police patrol wagon causes them to quickly dis-
appear. The sky is lit up in a myriad of colors from the multi-
tude of bars and nightclubs which line both sides of the streets.
From a distance -the sidewalk resembles a field of dazzling gems,
but on closer inspection the field of gems turns back into the piles
of broken wine and whiskey bottles. Dead end alleys so narrow
that a child would have to tread his way through them are prom-
inent in the ghetto. Obscene words are scribbled in white paint
on every wall. Contorted and grotesque drawings of nude fig-
ures engaging in the act of sexual intercourse are common sights.
Huge black sewer rats ‘dart in and out of rotted tenement apart-
ments-paying attention to nothing except the urges of their own
stomachs. The ghetto is perforated with large pot holes. '

The acrid odor of urine is all about the ghetto, and at cer-'
tain times reaches an almost stifling thickness. Hundreds of
stray dogs and cats wander around the avenues and sidestreets
of the ghetto, turning over garbage cans and scourging in gutters.
A puppy lies in a puddle of blood, a few feet from the curb.
Over him a small boy dressed in rags stoops, and, with great tears
in his eyes, looks towards a car careening down the ghetto street,

An old man lies in a sewer, and a few feet aw_ay,from him‘

IS ANYBODY LISTENING
TO CAMPUS VIEWS? .-. ~.'

BUSINESSMEN ARE. “ ' '

Three chief executive officers—The
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's
Chairman, Russel/De Young, The Dow
Chemical C ompan y’s President,

H. D. Doan, and Motorola's
Chairman, Robert W. Ga/vin—are
responding to serious questions and
viewpoints posed by students about
business and its role in our changing
society . . . and from their perspective

as heads of major corporations are
exchanging views through means of
a campus / corporate Dialogue
Program on specific issues raised by
leading student spokesmen.

_Here, David G. Clark, a Liberal Arts
graduate student at Stanford, is
exploring a question with Mr.

De Young. Administrative activities in
Greece and Austria, along with
broadening experience in university
administration, already have claimed
Mr. Clark's attention and auger well a

career in international affairs.

in the course of the entire Dialogue
Program, Mark Bookspan, a I
Chemistry major at Ohio State, also
will exchange viewpoints with Mr;
De Young,‘ as will David M. Butler, in
Electrical Engineering at Michigan
State, and Stan Chess, Journalism,
Cornell, with Mr. Doan,’ and similarly,
Arthur M. K/ebanoff, in Liberal Arts at
Yale, and Arnold She/by, Latin
American Studies at Tulane,

with Mr. Galvin.

All of these Dialogues will appear in
this publication, and other campus
newspapers across the country,
throughout. this academic year.
Campus comments are invited, and
should be forwarded to Mr. "
DeYoung, Goodyear, Akron, Ohio,’
Mr. Doan, Dow Chemical, Midland,
Michigan,‘ or Mr. Galvin, Motorola,
Franklin Park, Illinois, as appropriate.

Mr. De Young:

Dear Mr. DeYoung:

’?It is an extraordinary fact, that
at a time when affluence is
beginning to be the condition, or
at least the potential condition
of whole countries and regions,
rather than of a few favorite
individuals, and when scientific
feats are becoming possible,
which stagger mankind's wildest
dreams of the past, more people
in the world are suffering from
hunger and want than ever
before. Such a situation is so
intolerable and so contrary to
the best interest of all nations
that it should use the determina_-
tion on the part of the advanced
and developing countries alike
to bring it to an end."

This eloquent statement by the I
Secretary General of the United
Nations points up a problem of
which any informed citizen must
certainly be aware. Corporations,
also doubtless sense the
magnitude of the disparity
between the rich and the poor,
between the thriving and the
hungry. As the chief executive
officer of a giant multi-national
corporation, and as an individual
who has had considerable
working experience around the
world, you have seen first-hand
the wretched state of mankind
referred to by Mr. Thant.

At the same time, as Chairman of
Goodyear, you are the one most
responsible for the long-run
maximization of stockholders’
interests in the company. To
that end, you have led
Goodyear through a period of
significant growth in sales and
capital investment, most
dramatically in areas outside
the United States.

In response to a rapidly growing
market for rubber goods abroad,
more than 50°/o of Goodyear's
capital expenditures during
1963-1967 were for expansion of
international operations.
Consider the earnings on total
assets at home and abroad

for the same period.

Average

Domestic
Operations

5.3%—6.0%

Had Goodyear lnternational's
return for 1967 been at the same i
percentage level as the home
company's, foreign earnings
would have been $12.5 million
lower.

Whether the countries where
these operations are located have

Can you justify  

foreign exploitation?

gained as much as Goodyear has
gained is questionable,
especially so in the developing
countries. Exploitation is, after
all, nothing more than taking
advantage of the favorable
circumstances of another
country which may lack capital
and /or know-how while
justifying to ourselves that it is
in their best interest. Admittedly
such undertakings do provide
jobs, educational facilities,
medical care, better clothing and
shelter to employees and their
families. But this gives rise

to other questions.

Are these direct benefits for a
few people really enough?

Where are the "above normal"
foreign earnings going?

What right do we as Americans
and you as Goodyear have to
take resources from another
country for our own profit?

What is Goodyear doing to help‘
developing countries become
economically viable and ‘
independent members of the
world community? ls‘Goodyear
doing anything to help build up

indigenously owned businesses? .

Isn't it possible that several U.S.
and other foreign firms operating
in a small, developing country

' could become so centrally linked

to the economic health of the
country and hence to its
financial base as to be able to
strongly influence the composi-

tion and style of its government?

Mr. DeYoung, perhaps the
fundamental issue in all these
questions relates to the ever-
growing gap between the
prospering and starving nations.
Can American firms really
justify their position in the
developing countries when even
the most conservative population
biologists tell us that the world
will be experiencing severe food
shortages by 1980? Certainly
firms investing abroad may
expect a normal return on their
investment, but when so many
of the emerging nations are so
desperately in need of resources
for development in the broadest
sense, are we reallyjustified in
taking so much out from those
countries for our own

Dear Mr. Clark: .

Whether measured by economic
or social yardsticks, the direct
results of most modern multi-
national corporate activities in
the emerging nations is the
fostering of progressive
development—not exploitation
under the outdated concepts of
19th Century mercantilism.

Any casting of accounts reveals
that corporate policies, and their
implementing operations, are
focused toward growth within a
country. There is also a realistic
understanding that those
operations can be the essential
motivating force for any viable

V progress of the region.

Essentially, the "in-p_,ut" is‘ far
greater than the outflow,
all factors considered.

This is clearly revealed from an
economic perspective by the
fiscal policy planning and profit
position of many major
companies abroad. As demon-
strated by Goodyear's own
position, we have repatriated
considerably less than half of our
foreign earnings over the past
ten years. Conversely, more than
half of our earnings, have been
re-invested abroad. This has

been buttressed further by
additional capital investment-
both equity capital and long—term
Ioans—in the emerging nations.

' Even with this continuing

infusion of additional capital.
coupled with re-investment. for
the past thpee years, returns on ’
capital investment in these areas
still does not equaI—|et alone
exceed——returns on domestic

. operations.

This disparity is broadened
further by the tax factor. Taking
into account an overall tax rate
abroad of some 40,per cent, as
compared to the U.S. corporate
tax rate of 52.8 per cent. foreign
investment returns still are
markedly less than in our A
domestic operations, notwith-
standing the more favorable rate.

Implicit to this picture is the
posture of the major corporation
abroad both in terms of its
relationship to the hosting
foreign government. and the
effects of its operations on
economic and social growth.
Essentially operations are
designed to establish a base
for growth while meeting
immediate local needs,
disciplined by the realities of
the profit-motivated free
enterprise system.

 

In direct consequence the
host-country's GNP is increased,
tax revenues swelled, local
manufacturing stimulated, local
employment is expanded
broad|y‘with a wide range of
new jobs, and local consumer
needs satisfied-—which is of
crucial importance in conserving
"hard-money"reserves or foreign
exchange credits.

Equally, the impact of these
operations upon local living
standards cannot be dismissed
casually. For many it has meant
the incredible step forward from
"bare-surviva|”existence to a
viable way of life. To an
inordinate number this can be as
basic as obtaining an adequate
supply of potable water,
treatment of diseases we've
forgotten about in this country.
sufficient food, and at least
literacy level education.

The dimensions of this picture
are broadened further by the fact
that an investment climate is
generated that begins to attract
other major enterprises to the
area resulting in broader
diversification.

The simple truth is, Mr. Clark,
that the modern multi-national
corporation, disciplined by the
profit and loss risk, is the only
mechanism capable of creating,
implementing and managing
change. Accordingly it is through
its operations that rapid social
and economic development will ‘
occur in the emerging nations.

Don't you agree that its position’ ‘

isjustified?

Sincerely.

Russell DeYoung, Chairman
The Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Company

.‘Glass Wants Other

by ED CONLEY

Most ballplayers would" get worried if they couldn’t ‘hit
their own team’s pitchers in practice. That doesn’t worry Sam-

.my Glass, the Panther catcher.

The other day during an intrasquad game most of the mit-
ters were getting good wood on the ball, but Glass couldn’t

make contact:

“I’ve always had trouble hitting my own pitchers,” the receiver
‘mentioned. “I guess it’s because of the way I catch them.”

,“I‘ just find out the good points
of my pitcher,” he continued. “I
tell myself that he .is good. I try
to build the kid up in his mind.”

This method of handling. the

“ moundsmen seems to have work-

ed out well for the mitters. With
Glass behind the plate in twenty
of twenty-five games last spring the

f starting corps compiled a 2.67
ERA.

Glass feels that he can hit
against hurlers, as long as they
are from other teams. He proved
this last year when he hit close

' to .300 most of the campaign. He

finished at .270 after a late sea-
son drought, but the only return-
ing mitter who did better was
Bob Kohl with a .290 average in
eleven games.

“I started off real good. Then,
I hit a slump and got only two
hits in my last seven games,” he
noted. “But, I believe I can hit.”

In practice Glass showed that
he was ready to field. He picked
a runner off first after a strike
and was all over the field chasing
fouls. Once, he outlegged his first
beseman to a pop between first
and home, and another time he
crashed into the stadium wall af-
ter making a difficult running
catch on a ball that looked out of
reach.

But Glass wantsmost to prove
his ability with the bat. That op-
portunity will come as soon as he
gets to see some unfamiliar faces

Graduation, Indecision Dim
Tennis Prospects In Tough
New Season For Ben Pope

by BILL NAAB
Tennis coach Ben Pope

must feel as though he just V

stepped off the ledge of a ten
story building. With the sud-

I denness of such a fall, coach
‘ Pope has lost almost his entire

squad of the previous season.

Bill Nicholas, his “greatest
loss,” Bob Salembier; Elliot
Sainer; and Chuck Wilson have
all graduated. In addition to los-

'ing his number 1, 2, 5, and 6

men of last season, Pope may al-
so find another push from the
rear.

His. number 3 man, John King,
may not be eligible because of a
lack of credits. Doug McKee,
Mike Riggle, and J. D. Lewis,
are also probable disappoint-
ments. McKee, a promising fresh-
man, is on probation, and Cager
Mike Riggle is reportedly look-

 ing ahead to an early spring in

his home‘ town.

"‘Riggle’s on a tightrope,” said
‘Pope. “Sometimes he says that
.he can help us, then he says he
can’t. Right now he says he
hasn’t recovered from basket-

ball. I can’t tell you anything that .

he’s going to do. He's a fine ten-
nis player, though. He was rated
aboutthe sixth best in the state of
Indiana.”

The J. D.,Lewis story is just as
complex. Lewis, a sensational kick-
off return man for the Panther
‘grid-iron squad, is more interest-

ed in’ spring football practice than "

participating for Pope’s netters.

At first, Pope said that Lewis
would play in some matches. “We-
re going to try to get him for the
April 1st and 4th matches.”
There’s a special reason why Pope
wants Lewis for the early matches.
His frosh netmen do not bloom in-
to eligible sophomores until
the winter term reaches a climax.

But, that spring football practice
begins March 28 and doesn't
end till April 26. Lewis in all
probability will not participate
until the last few matches, if at
all.

The sticky situation could be-
come somewhat slicker, though, if
Riggle who will be freed from

basketball practice this Satur-

day would__offer his services] until
the- end of the winter term. In
this spin of the needle, Riggle
would arrive home to the Hoosier

state come the end of the term
and still look like a Patrick Henry
to Ben Pope. As for Lewis, he’d
be ready at the end of the sche-
dule.

With or without these two ath-
letes, Pope will not be short of
players. It’s just that most of
them will be fill-in men until the
frosh can trot down to the courts
as sophomores. About 11 fresh-
men are trying out for the team,
although only a few have devel-
oped enough to participate in var-
sity competition.

Veteran Tom Stromp, how-
ever, will have no trouble mak-
ing the varsity. In fact,,Stromp is
expected to be the number 1
man. Last year he had the best re-
cord on the squad, 10-3.

Besides Stromp, Pope main-’

tains hopes for freshman Dick
Wright and last year’s number 7
man Jim Thompson. “Thompson,”
Pope said. “didn’t produce a

win for us when he was used in’

emergencies.” With a year’s ex-
perience, the coach hopes that
Thompson will be ready for the
season ahead.

Wright, Pope suspects, should
be a pretty fair performer. The
other frosh must also turn out to be
‘pretty fair’ in order to prevent a
long, dark fall from 1968’s 6-7
record. I '

on the mound.” This means the
Miami Tournament action which
starts Monday.

Glass welcomes this tourney
for another reason, too. He re-
members a similar one in River-
side, California last spring.

“I’m real happy about the trips,”
he said. “Not because it means
going some place. I just like to
play baseball.” I

“And people know you’re com-
ing to play ball,’’ he continued.
“The. whole town was ready last
year. It was like the Mardi Gras
to New Orleans, almost.”

“The people would yell at you,
‘God Luck,” or ‘Go Get ’em,”
he added. “That tournament at
Riverside was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me in base-
ball.” ’

Actually, one would get the im-
pression that the greatest thing
that ever happened to Glass was
college baseball. ’ "

“I’ve sort of always wanted to
play college ball,” he said. “A
long time ago I decided not to
try pro ball even if I would be
good enough‘. It’s just a great feel-
ing playing with ateam like this.”

0 Spring

by JERRY GRUEBEL
Sports Editor

 

A week ago Thursday, baseball coach Bobby Lewis was
restlessly sitting on the chair behind his desk when in walked
catcher "Sammy Glass. Lewis was experiencing his version of
euphoria, sort of doing his own thing. '

“Where’d you get the money?” asked Glass, smiling in-
tuitively.
The baseball team is going to Coral Gables, Florida for

. spring training this season. They’ll fly down tomorrow nightz¢;’l"r-

loosen up Sunday, and then play seven teams in the next six
days.

But that is nothing new to Lewis, who three weeks ago in-
sisted, “We’re going,.period.”

What is new is that the trip is financed. Earlier in the
year, concerned alumni contributed half of the $4,000 needed
to make the trip; butfor quite some time it looked as if the
mitters, pledged to participate in the Florida tournament, would
have to pay the remaining expenses themselves. That would
have meant $78 out of each player’s pocket. '

“They will not pay,” new athletic director Casimir My-
slinski told Lewis firmly. “Mypolicy is — subsidized by the
University or they don’t go.”

For Lewis it was a temporary victory. Last year, the mild-
tempered mitt mentor took his first step towards a career-long

goal of boosting the University's‘! baseball program to the big,-~._

time. He entered his team in the annual National Collegiate
Baseball Tournament. Sunny Riverside-California marked the
first spring training site ever.

Lewis and his players had to sweat,out that first step.
The athletic department hadn’t budgeted for such a tripand it
refused to “find” the needed money. So, Lewis had a television“
set raffled off, leaving the saleswork up to his players.

That was against University policy and, as a result, the
players were faced with the possibility of paying their own way

to Florida when they learned that this year’s spring training was ,

not "considered in the budget either.
Lewis wants his team to fly South again next year. In fact,

Lewis expressed publicly his intentions of making such a trip a

tradition. That will probably never happen. ‘

Myslinski wants big - time baseball at the University‘. too.

However, the athletic director disagrees with Lewis’s concept of ’

how this can be achieved. He sees a two-step solution: (1) play-

 ing at the new baseball field behind Trees Hall instead of

Leech Farm Field which is miles away; and (2) scheduling
home games with big-time baseball teams.

“If the weather here was like it is in Arizona year’-round-,:”;’

I’d never want to leave,” explained Lewis. “But you can’t
play baseball in the snow.”

Lewis’s quest for big-time baseball brings to mind more
‘than just the surfaced problem of how to achieve such a goal.
It brings to mind the question raised by ex- Pitt News Sports
Editor Roy Jacobs, in his final column last Friday. is big-time
athletics necessary at all? ‘

";Bemis Takes Spring Look  
.,At Soccermen Tomorrow;

First Of Two Scrimmages

Soccer is considered a fall sport, but for the hooters it is also
a spring sport. Tomorrow morning at 10:30 a.m. on the All-
Purpose Field, the hooters will scrimmage Harmerville.

“It’s just a scrimmage,” explained soccer coach Leo Bemis. “It’s

not for blood, or anything like that.”

Spring practice is advantageous
for both Bemis and his team. It
gives the coach the opportunity to
experiment with his team, and it
gives the freshman booters the
opportunity to play with the
varsityrnen.

Last year, spring soccer prac-
tice was limited by bad weather.

_ In fact, the booters were able to

F» scrimmage only once. But Bemis
hopes this spring will be a little
more congenial.

Another scrimmage is tentatively

scheduled for March 29. The
booters will face a team of foreign
students.

Next F or Wessel

National Indoor Swimming
competition is set for next week-
end in Bloomington Indiana, but
sophomore diver Dave Wessel
won’t be among the competitors.

‘Wessel placed fourth in Eas-
tern championships last week-
end, but according to swim
coach Bill Grant, Dave wasn’t
pleased with his performance on
the three meter board.

“He has two bad dives on the
three_ meter board and wants to
work on those,” explains Grant.
“He’ll work on those over the
summer and then plans to go to
the outdoor nationals this sum-
met.”

The outdoor nationals will be
held in Toledo sometime during
July or August, and just as in
the case for the indoor cham-
pionships, the competition will
include the best in the country.

Coach Perry will have to build
this year’s team from just three
lettermen of last season’s squad
which attained a, 6-9 mark. They
are Henry Higgenbottom, Mike
McGuire and John Meteney.

Right now, Peery has about
twenty boys out for the squad.
“After a little practice, we’ll put
them head to head and see
which ones are best in compe-
tition, ” explained Peery.

The site of the squad’s prac-
tice sessions and home matches
