Politicians reach compromise, but street stays open

Marc Nuzzo

 

Years of heated debate over the deci-
sion to close Bigelow Boulevard or keep
it open ofﬁcially ended yesterday after-
noon in a compromise.

Mayor Tom Murphy announced the

city’s plans to keep the
street open but to signif-
icantly constrict the
boulevard and improve
the surrounding area.

In a noon press con-
ference, the mayor said the city will nar-
row the road from its current 60-foot
width to approximately 30 feet, eliminate
the line of parking spaces along the front
of the Cathedral of Learning, and ‘‘sig—
nificantly increase the amount of green
space in the area.”

The improvements are expected to

 

 

begin this fall.

Murphy went on to say the city will
pay the proposed $500,000 to $750,000
cost without Pitt’s assistance and will
seek no compensation for the land gained
by Pitt.

By comparing the Bigelow improve— «

ments to recent improvements on Liberty
~‘ Avenue carried out by
the city, Murphy said the
street remains a city
responsibility. '

Council President Jim
Ferlo agreed with the
mayor and said this was the city’s half of
the Bigelow bargain.

“We turned from the [concepts] of a
land swap and cost sharing to do what we
want to do [with the street],” he said.
“It’s our street, let’s keep that in mind,
and we’re upgrading it appropriately.”

Murphy said the city council’s vote

was “technically” not required to make
this decision, but its vote will be needed
to approve some of the expenditures. He
said he expects no major problem in get-

project.

our students’ money in a fair and just man-
ner,” DalMolin told the council. “You do
not do that right now.”

The proposal was crafted over spring
break and shown to administrators for their
input, according to its authors.

The rest of the CGS council said they
thought this action was “behind their
backs.” When an audit of their budget was
revealed, members of the council were
even more upset. T

At least three members had received
the proposal on the same day as the meet-
ing. They had not heard of the audit and
said that they felt unprepared to discuss the
document.

“All of this information is really a
shoe ,” said member Sheila May-Stein. “I
had no preparation [for the proposal or the
audit].”

Member Linda Messineo felt that a
school break was an inappropriate time to
write the proposal and questioned the pro-
cedures surrounding it and the audit.

“These are two very signiﬁcant mat-
ters that are taking place + and in writing,
without my knowledge, and I object to
that,” Messineo said.

This lack of preparation did not pre-
vent a two-hour discussion over the vari-

The College of General Studies stu-
dent government may dissolve itself, only
to congeal as a governance group under the
board that serves students in the arts and
sciences.

In a proposal presented to the CGS
student government Monday night,
President Erika Nanz and Vice President
Marjorie Carlson asked the board to con-
sider reforming themselves under the aus-
pices of the FAS Student Government
Board.

Carlson cited budget constraints as a
problem and said the proposal was
designed to create a student group that
could better serve current constituents.

“We are neither adequately serving the
needs of CGS students or non—traditional
students,” she said. “We need more pro-
gramming; we need to be more visible.”

The group could do these things by
becoming a governance group, according
to Nanz, Carlson, and the SGB President
Justin DalMolin, who was also involved in
drafting the proposal.

DalMolin made a brief presentation
about the proposal and pointed out what he
saw as the problems with the CGS student
government.

year battle to determine what should be
done with the Bigelow Boulevard corri-
dor, which slices through the busiest sec-
tion of Pitt’s campus. Both the
University and the city see this as a suit-
able compromise.

Murphy said this compromise is the
best solution for Pitt and the surrounding
community, which must strive for a part-
nership in improving Pittsburgh.

“Pitt is a valuable ally and a partner
in rebuilding Pittsburgh,” said Murphy.
“It is critical to the success of the city.”

Though city council members are
still waiting to see the results from the
closing—study report, Oakland
Councilman Dan Cohen and Council
President Jim Ferlo supported the move
as beneﬁcial for the city. ’

Cohen said he believes the compro-
mise may begin a North Oakland revital-
ization effort. He said he also expects the

with the University of Pittsburgh.”

Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
said he sees both beneﬁts and drawbacks
in the decision but still views the result
with optimism.

“It’s not everything we sought,” said
Nordenberg, but he still called the deci-
sion a “good compromise.”

“I understand the student disappoint-
ment at not achieving a complete clo-
sure,” he said.

Nordenberg also said he shared the
sentiments of city ofﬁcials and wants Pitt
to be a part of the city’s improvement.

“This is the first example of the
ways in which [the] city and the
University can cooperate for the good of
the city  we expect to cooperate [with
the city] on other projects that will bene-
ﬁt the general good of Oakland.”

College Republicans accuse Pitt
Program Council of liberal bias

Heidi Price & Rick Bruni, Jr.

 

The Pitt Program Council’s last
five lecturers — George
Stephanopolous, Greg Louganis, Chris
Darden, Maya Angelou, and Billy Joel
— have one thing in common, accord-

ing to some angry College
Republicans.

They’re liberals,

Members of the College

Republicans have criticized the PPC,
saying the lecture committee has failed
to slate speakers who represent conser-
vative students on campus.

“[The PPC] is bringing in people
like Greg Louganis, a guy who’s
famous for being a gay Olympian,” said
Matt Mills, president of the College
Republicans. “When , .;
it's a politically cor- ll‘
rect cause, it certain-
ly doesn’t hurt the
Program Council."

Recounting the
names of the PPC’s
recent lecturers,
Mills said he thinks
a left-wing political
slant exists.

“It seems to me
that this is more than
just a coincidence,”
Mills said. 

PPC lecture director Ethyl Uy said
it is exactly that, a coincidence. Uy
described the speaker selection process
as a “bottom—up rational process,”
where students on the lecture commit-
tee suggest speakers. Uy said the crite-
ria for choosing lecturers for upcoming
semesters doesn’t include political
views, but rather “people who are now,
people who are headliners” and are
economically feasible for the group’s
budget.

Civil rights activist Winnie
Mandela is still chartered to speak at
Pitt. She was originally slated for
February to coincide with Black

     

History Month but had to reschedule
for personal reasons and will come to
Pitt in April.

However, College Republicans
question the partiality of the lecture
committee.

“I think when you have people of a

liberal perspective choosing speakers,
it’s only natural,” said Paul Clark, a
freshman member of the College
Republicans.

“I don’t think there’s a huge con-
spiracy, but just looking at who they’ve
brought in so far, I’d say there’s a defi-
nite slant,” he said. Mills aired,.his
views to PPC’s executive director,
Lisabeth Dixon during an SGB town-
hall meeting in February.

“Matt told me he wanted to become
involved, and I told him [that the com-
mittee] is open to everyone,” Dixon
recalled. “I haven’t seen him any-
where.” "

Mills said that he hadn’t joined
because he was graduating in two
months.

“One of the other CR’s joined the

 lecture committee,”
he said. “In the
future we can try to
do things differently,
straighten them out a
little.”

Dixon said she
is frustrated by
Mills’ critical com-
ments.

“I don’t take
criticism well from
someone who does-
n’t want to work,
someone who’s
going to stand outside the office and
say, ‘You suck,”’ Dixon said.

Mills has claimed that through his
membership in the Young Americans
Foundation, a conservative group, he
would be able to bring in less costly
speakers who would represent a wider
spectrum of political views -— includ-
ing Oliver North and Christian
Coalition Director Ralph Reed.

“They paid [$30,000] for George
Stephanopolous, If I had $15,000 I
could have brought in Dan Quayle,”
said Mills.

Dixon and Uy stressed that any stu-
dent who wishes to participate in the
speaker selection process should attend
lecture committee meetings on
Tuesdays at 6 p.m. in room 504 of the
William Pitt Union.

“You can’t drag people in to partic-
ipate,” said Uy, who then added, “The
door is never shut to new ideas.”

all the plans are reviewed at once.

“Reviews will take place

throughout March, and we’ll prob-
ably reach our conclusions in early
April, the first week of Ap ' ,” said
Vice Provost Robert Pack.

The plans are ﬁrst reviewed by
the vice provost with lead responsi-
bility for that unit. For example,
Pack handles the regional campus-
es. Those initial reviews resolve
outstanding questions —- whether
the plan is complete or not, and
whether it contains all the infom1a-
tion needed. A

Pack said that assuming the
plans are complete, copies are then
given to all ﬁve senior staff mem-
bers in the provost’s ofﬁce and to
the provost area’s Planning and
Budget Committee (PBC).

The senior staff then have an
all-day meeting to discuss as many

‘of the plans as they can get

through. Pack said that they also
prepare budgetary and historical
information on the units, so that
everyone has the same level of
understanding. The PBC also
meets with Provost James Maher
to give its reactions.

From there, Pack said, the
provost makes determinations
about each unit and gives them his
reaction to their plan and the con-
sequences of that reaction in terms

 

of the unit’s budget.

The chancellor does not look
at each of the unit plans, according
to Pack. ’

“He will generally meet with
the provost and discuss his general
reaction to them,” Pack said. “A
number [of them] he will read, if he
has a particular interest in issues
within that unit. [Maher’s decision]
certainly is a detennination that
would be consistent with the chan-
cellor’s own views.” .

The provost’s ﬁnal decisions
do not include the six health—sci-
ences schools, which do not report
to him but rather to Thomas Detre,
the vice chancellor for health sci-
ences.

The provost has asked for a 5
percent reallocation of budget
resources within each school every
year. Of that 5 percent, halfis guar-
anteed to stay within the school to
be used for important projects. The
other half goes to the_ provost’s
ofﬁce for reallocation between
schools. Maher has said that it is
possible for that money to be
returned to the school from which

' it came.

The proposals answer ques-
tions about each school’s goals,
how close they can come to meet-
ing them while still setting aside
that 5 percent every year, and what

 

 FROM PAGE I  I
they need to cut to make those
goals possible. Budget documenta-
tion is expected to support these
goals.

Maher has stressed the impor-
tance of ﬁnding an “appropriate”
faculty size and that having a
smaller faculty would free up addi-
tional resources for individual pro-
jects. FAS has 555 tenure-stream
faculty this year, and the provost
has said that that number needs to
go down.

Once it is approved by the
committee, the proposal will rec-
ommend a new target size for the
school. Ten graduate departments
have been the focus of a debate
over the University’s priorities and
how all the FAS departments were
evaluated.

' The Classics, East Asian lan-
guage and literature, French and
Italian, German, linguistics, Slavic,
geology, religious studies, sociolo-
gy, and theater—arts departments all
face possible cuts. Chairs of these
departments and members of the
FAS Graduate Student
Organization spoke to the commit-
tee last month.

Maher has said that he hopes
cooperation between these depart-
ments is possible to avoid the elim-
ination of departments.

 

ous facets of the plan. Despite
attempts to explain the plan at
the outset, there was confusion
over what would happen if the
CGS council was to become a
governance group and about
what a governance group actu-
ally is.

DalMolin said that by hav-
ing governance status, the CGS
group could eliminate duplicate
costs.

“We can adequately supply
your organization’ with ade-
quate supplies and the use of
our secretary and our oﬁce,”
DalMolin said.

Other duplicate costs that
the proposal could eliminate
include Pitt Program Council
dues, student employees, tele-
phone expenses, ofﬁce sup-
plies, and mailings.

The proposal was written
because the predicted budget
for ﬁscal year 1998 totaled
$90,000, but before the meet-
ing, the authors received some
unexpected information.
Advisor Karrie Valauri told
them that the budget would be
$125,000 again, and that this
would not leave the CGS stu-
dent government in debt for
this year.

This information did not

FROM PAGE 1

cause Nanz, Carlson, and
DalMolin to withdraw their
proposal. They’ said that even
with the $l25,0()0 budget, the
CGS council is not meeting the
needs of CGS or non-tradition-
al students. They raised the
concern that $90,0()0 of their
budget was being spent main-
taining the CGS student gov-
ernment oﬁice, which had only
provided $500 in programming
in the last year.

Amelia Joiner, a member
of the council, expressed
doubts that the student govem-
ment was serving its students

“If the students really
knew what was going on with
their money . they’d be
pissed,” Joiner said.

By 10:30 pm., all involved
agreed that it would be best to
give the council a chance to
read the document, do some
more research, and formulate
questions.

The CGS council will meet
again to discuss the proposal in
a special meeting on Monday,
Mar. 17, at 8:30 p.m. DalMolin
said he will be there to help
explain what will happen if the
change goes through. All CGS
and non-traditional students are
encouraged to attend.

Bigelow Boulevard bustled with pedestri-
an and car traﬂic yesterday, after the city
announced that Bigelow would remain open
permanently.

Mayor Tom Murphy and City
Councilman Jim Ferlo announced yesterday
that Bigelow will remain open, but that it will
be reduced to a two—lane street with no parking.

The decision raised both criticism and dis-
cussion among Pitt students and business own-
ers. Most had a preference but said they didn’t
ﬁnd it a very important issue. \

“Basically, it doesn’t matter to me.
Sometimes the cars can get on your nerves. I
think they need a better walkway for students to
cross, but other than that, I really don’t care,”
said Marla Sarns, a freshman.

As she waited patiently for an opening in
the trafﬁc, Rui H. Zhang said she thought the
inﬂux of students in the area during the shut-
down was almost as bad as the cars.

“It didn’t matter really, although I thought ‘

there were too many people hanging around
[the Cathedral] when it was closed,” Zhang
said, right after she waved to the car that
stopped to let her cross.

Jemrifer Molluso, head of the SGB’s
Bigelow Boulevard Task Force, described the
narrowing of Bigelow Boulevard as “an empty
victory for students.”

“I totally disagree with Ferlo that this is a
win-win situation.” Molluso said she wants to
continue the ﬁght to close Bigelow and hopes
that the narrowing ofthe street “is a step in the
right direction.”

She also felt conﬁdent that students will
continue to work toward a permanent closing.

Surprisingly, many of the business owners
said the fate of Bigelow Boulevard probably
wouldn't affect them.

Stop Outside Vendor, located on the comer of

“Actually, I think it would be nicer closed

little harder, but... I’m the only one it affects,
and I’m okay with it,” he said. ‘
Other business owners said they weren’t
able to tell whether the previous closing affect-

Khalil said the shutdown was a conve-
nience for pedestrians, though driving in
Oakland was made much more difficult by the
shutdown.

Terry Campasano, employee and daughter
of the owner of the O restaurant, was very
happy to hear the city’s decision.

“It’s great! It’s perfect! Excellent!” she
exclaimed. “It’s good to see that all the money
we spent ﬁghting it wasn’t in vain.”

Carnpasano reported a 50 percent
decrease in business when Bigelow was closed.

She said the city’s decision was “a great
compromise.”

“It was the right thing to do. It saved the O
and all the businesses in Oakland.”

CWO isn't as
controversial as some
people think it is

I would like to address a number of
comments made by Marc Friedberg in his
column, “CWO Will Never Be A
Governance Group.” First of all, CW 0 has
not yet even applied to be a governance
group; it has simply been discussed.

Second of all, I am interested to know
what controversial issues CWO takes a
stance on. As far as I understand, our pro-
choice position is the only controversial
one, and we do not exclude people who
differ in opinion; they may simply choose
not to participate in events dealing with
reproductive rights. Maybe believing that
women shouldbe equal is controversial, or
maybe saying rape is wrong and that
women should not be beaten are contro-
versial positions. ‘

Thirdly, CWO does not claim to rep-
resent over half of the students at this
University. If this message was ever con-
veyed, I apologize. We would never claim
to represent all women. We do, however,
address issues that could affect any woman
on campus, such as sexual assault. Also, if
the allocations process did not operate on

an all-or-nothing policy,
we wouldnft necessarily
be working toward gov-
ernance status. I am not
talking about a small
monetary difference
between governance

opposed this concept.
The call for a civilian
review board is nothing
new. In the early ‘70s, a
civilian review board
was promoted but was
successfully defeated

groups and student orga-
nizations. At the least,
some governance groups
are allocated more than
25 times more money per
year than CW 0.

Lastly, I think that it is important to
note that CW 0 endorsed Justin DalMolin,
Marc’s previous SGB presidential oppo-
nent. So when Marc says that he will tell

the truth on issues, he may be just a bit’

biased.
Laura Bardwell
Publicity Chair, CWO

Know the facts
before you support
a Civilian Review

There is a current push to impose a
Civilian review board over the Pittsburgh

Police. The Support Your Local Police
Committee of western Pa. has long

 

when the citizens were
given the facts. Through
the decades, there has
been a subtle, then an
increasingly I bolder
effort to harass and discredit local police
forces and their individual policemen.
Civilian review boards are among the more
carefully plotted schemes for harassing the
police, discrediting individual policemen,
and discouraging all those who would
want to do their duty. We have long said
that the chief function of these boards, in
practice, if not in theory, is to make every
individual police ofﬁcer scared to death as
to every action he takes in dealing with
vicious criminal situations, of being called
before some board weeks or months later
and condemned with loss of pay or maybe
loss of job, for having been too unkind to
those who were about to shoot him or
stomp in his face.

-We don’t say all police ofﬁcers are
perfect, but statistics prove that half of 1
percent of them do a disservice to their uni-
form! The Pittsburgh Police already have

an excellent discipline system in place and
are working to make it even better. For
those interested in the origin of the civilian
review boards, according to Bella Dodd, a
former member of the Communist Party
who defected in 1948, “The idea was orig-
inated and invented by the Communist
party in the 1930s. The idea was somehow
to get the police out from under the control
of elected officials and subject them to dis-
cipline of a civilian group which the Party
could inﬁltrate and control.” She stated that
by these means, they intendedto mete out
harsh and arbitrary punishment against the
police until they were intimidated into a
benumbed, neutralized, impotent, and non-
functioning agency. We urge all concerned
citizens to oppose the Civilian Review
Board. When you do come across ques-
tionable criticism of your local police,
learn the facts. If the criticism is unjusti-
ﬁed, help set the record straight. For the
record, we feel the Justice Departrnent’s
intervention is unacceptable, especially
their demands for an “early—warning sys-
tem” and “sensitivity training.” The cry of
the federal bureaucrat has always been to
neutralize, federalize, and centralize. Let’s
work to support our local police and keep
them independent! The stakes could be
your home  or your life.

If it weren't for Jefferson, there wouldn't be an Independence Day

 

I suppose I would be asking a dumb
question if I inquired as to how many of my
fellow students took the time out of their
day to watch Ken Burns’ documentary
‘Thomas Jefferson” last month on PBS.
Watch something educational? I under-
stand that is a foreign concept to many peo-

ple. After ‘all, how can educational stuff .

compare to mindless, adolescent dribble
like MI‘V’s “The Real World?” Well, I
think it’s a real shame that teens and twen-
tysomethings don’t seem to take an interest
in history.

Those who didn’t watch “Thomas
Jefferson” missed a real treat. It was a ﬁlm
10 times better than the endlessly repetitive
action ﬂicks that Hollywood produces
today (e.g: Independence Day), and 50
times more interesting than the garbage
that television shows like “The Real
World” hoist on us. Is the real world a
bunch of self-centered, hedonistic, spoiled
children lounging around all day in la beau-
tifnl million—dollar house in Miami, shriek-
ing at each other and acting like immature

‘ brats? I don’t think so.

Produced by acclaimed documentary
ﬁlmmaker Ken Burns, the creator of the
riveting “The Civil War,” “Thomas
Jefferson” was a fascinating look at one of
our most mystifying founding fathers, a
man who helped to create America and

s overnight.

who has spoken some of the most profound
words ever uttered about freedom.
Narrated by the phenomenal actor Sam
Waterston (for those who want to watch a
good TV show, I suggest Waterston’s NBC
legal drama “Law & Order”), “Thomas
Jefferson” delved deeply into the life of a
man who was called by one historian “the
greatest enigma among major ﬁgures in
American history.”

For those who for-
got what they were
taught in their high-
school history classes,

 

ed the catechism.” When Jefferson wrote
that Americans have the right to. “life, liber-
ty, and the pursuit of happiness,” he was
articulating the principles of mankind’s
dream of freedom. The words Jefferson
wrote in the Declaration of Independence
have been quoted by practically every rev-
olutionary group that has fought oppres-
sion (real or otherwise) for the last 200
years His words were profound in the 18th

 century, and they have
relevance to the
American experience
today as we near the

Territory from the French in 1803, practi-
cally doubling the size of the United States
However, merely listing
Jefferson’s achievements simply. doesn’t
give you a proper understanding of what
his legacy is. George Will called Jefferson
“The Man of the Millennium” (and for
once, I actually agree with the sometimes
loopy rhetoric of the archconservative
columnist) and noted in the ﬁlm that
Jefferson “gave us our creed... we have a
civil religion in this country, and he provid-

 

have used to deride
Jefferson’s accom-
plishments. While in
Paris as ambassador to
France, Jefferson voiced his support for the
bloody French ‘Revolution, and when a
group of poor Massachusetts farmers led
by a man named Daniel Shays attacked
their creditors, Jefferson wrote to a friend:
“The tree of liberty must be refreshed from
time to time with the blood of patriots and
tyrants. They are its natural manure.”
Given his sympathetic attitude toward anti-
authoiity insurrections like Shays
Rebellion, one may speculate whether or
not Jefferson would have considered the

actions of right—wing militia groups like the
Oklahoma City bombers and those who
violently resist federal agencies like the
ATF and FBI as justiﬁed. (I suspect he
probably would have regarded such actions
as good insofar as they sent the government
a wake-up call.) Critics have also attacked
Jefferson’s legacy by noting that the man
who wrote that “all men are created equal”
also owned slaves, making him a hyp-
ocrite.

With all of these chinks in his armor,
should we still respect J efferson? I think so.
Jefferson himself wrote: “None of us, no
none of us, are perfect. Were we to love
none who have imperfections, this world
would be a desert for our love.” Thomas
Jefferson tells us a lot about who and what
we- are as a people. He was a man riddled
with contradictions and tremendous
achievements. Those words that Jefferson
wrote so long ago still affect us today.
Without Thomas Jefferson, who knows
what sort of world we might live in today‘?
Perhaps the writer Gore Vidal summed up
Jefferson best when he said, “If there is
such a thing as the American spirit, then he
is it.” It is a shame that people today don’t
seem to remember the fact that courageous
men and women worked hard so that peo-
ple today can lounge around and watch
MTV. I’m proud that I do.

Michael Berquist thinks that we should
admire great Americans like Thomas
Jeﬁerson and not the losers on MTV

Go and get iWVith your good
credit.
——- Tower of Power, “Credit”

If there’s one thing I’ve
learned in the past year, it’s that
having a good credit rating isn’t
always to your advantage.

You see, I sort of made a mis-
take about two years ago. I com-
pletely paid oﬂ° my Citibank Visa,
which I had maxed out a few
months before.

So guess what? Everybody
thinks I have money now, and

people want it.
T'hat’s probably the way the
American capitalist system

works. That is, you try to ﬁnd
ways to soak folks out of their
money so that you can go and get
yourself soaked out of that money.

For the pastthreedecades,

you could actually go into a store,
pick out an item or service, and
walk off owning it without cash
changing hands. All you need to
do is hand the merchant or repre-
sentative a thin piece of plastic

with rounded comers, a magnetic ing on. more way to soak you out of your
strip on the back, and a bunch of Next thing I know, two years money.

embossed numbers, sign some later I’m pushing the $1,400 limit. Of course, once you get a
kind of form, and it is all yours, I got lucky once, when Citibank credit card, most card companies
lock, stock, and barrel. raised it $700 without my knowl— offer sweet incentives to use it.

Given this reality, it’s no
wonder Americans owe so much
money. The modern concept of
credit gives us the freedom to buy
now and pay later. I think the aver-
age credit card debt now
approaches four ﬁgures per per-
son. Sadly, we often pull out the
plastic for stuff we really don’t
need. A stereo system? That new
outﬁt? Even I admit that I did
without a lot more when I didn’t
have a credit card than I do now.

I got that Visa, my ﬁrst major
card, in 1992. Ofcourse, I said at
the outset I would be disciplined
—— using it only for emergencies,
making only small purchases, and
paying it off in full each month.

But then, reality hit. I thought
to myself, “Well, the interest
charges aren't really that bad. A
dollar here, 50 cents there —— no
big deal. So what if they're mak-
ing a little money off me? I can
handle it.”

Which Citibank was count-

edge, but I ended up plowing
through that with ease. Only
inheritance money I didn’t know
was coming saved me from ruin.

So was that the end? Hardly.

Apparently, I’ve ended up on
someone’s “good credit” list, and
now I’m getting all these applica-
tions for more cards —— preap-
proved, mind you. Occasionally,
telemarketers even tried to push
Visa Gold cards on me, but I man-
aged to beg off by telling them
that my salary didn’t qualify.
(Which is the truth.)

As it was, I did decide to take
them up on some of those offers.
VV1thin six months, I picked up, in
this order, a second Visa, a
MasterCard (which I later got rid
of because it was charging 25 per-
cent interest), a Bravo, and a
Discover. The last two, by the
way, came from the same compa-
ny, which I assume started issuing
Bravos because you’re only
allowed one Discover Card. One

My Citibank Visa offers rebates if
I ever want to buy a new Ford
automobile; my Bell Atlantic Visa
lowers my phone bill; my
Discover gives cash back. Of
course, they can afford to offer
such incentives because they
know they’ll recoup the money in
interest charges given the way
Americans spend. Then they
encourage‘ you to make cash
advances “for a small transaction
fee”(such as your ﬁrstbom child).

Then, more phone calls from
those dreaded telemarketers, usu-
ally around dinner time, undoubt-
edly because that's when they ﬁg-
me people will be home. It’s got-
tentothe point that my roommate,
who himself has four major credit
cards, and I don’t even answer the
phone before 9 o’clock if ,we’re
there. I can usually tell when a
telemarketer tried and failed to
reach us; the red light on my
answering machine comes on
whenever callers make contact,

but if there’s no message, I’m
pretty sure they only sought busi-
ness.

Usually, they try to push
magazines, which are a real temp-
tation because I do like to read,
and occasionally I get an offer for
a cruise. Of course, they want me
to putit on my card. (I did get
burned twice. Fortunately, I had
the money — and to them, that's
all that counts.) ’

How do I survive? By living
simply. I indulge in only two lux-
uries: cable television and a coni-
pact-disc collection nearing 250. I
only recently got a car as an early
graduation gift. My stereo system
is 25 years old, and I spend little
on clothes. I usually don’t have

time to travel, and when I do, I

usually visit out-of-town friends
who live in or near big cities.

So, the next time I get one of
those calls, I plan to say, “No,
thank you,” and hang up.

Just because I have good
credit doesn’t mean I have to use
it.\

Rick Nowlin now has more money
than he used to ——- but no phone
calls, please.

Prepping for
the not-so-big
dance

  

A mixture of post-spring-break hang-
overs and a few rampaging viruses have half
the campus laid up.

Tonight, you can add another sickness
— NIT fever.

The Privateers of New Orleans

_ University bring their act to the Fitzgerald

Field House this evening, representing the
feared Sun Belt Conference in a life-and-
death struggle against the Big East jugger-
naut Pitt Panthers.

Talk about a hangover. Panther sports
fans, still reeling from being destroyed by
Boston College in the Big East Tournament,
are now faced with a home game in the most

' worthless athletic enterprise this side of the

NFL Pro Bowl.

Some fans might be willing to go on
with their lives, but that would mean looking
forward to football season. In other words:
Bring on those stinkin’ Privateers!

Yes, the NIT is a gloriﬁed consolation
bracket to determine the 65th-best college
team in the country, give or take a few auto-
matic bids. And yeah, Pitt’s real postseason
test ended in failure at the hands of Danya
Abrams. For all practical purposes, the sea-
son is over.

So what?

Instead of trying tocure NIT fever, sit
back and let the symptoms sink in for a sec-
ond.

Thanks to this postseason joke, we get
one more evening of Jason Maile dropping
3—pointers from different zip codes. One
more night of Chad Varga throwing oppo-
nents around under the boards.

One more glimpse of Gerald Jordan
doing  well  doing better than he did last
week, hopefully. It’s a chance for redemp-
tion for a fonner starter who had as many
points as he did ‘fouls against UConn and
BC.

After tonight, these three players will
vanish into European leagues, family life,

Still not enough to
go to the Dance

Victory over UConn, loss to BC _

Matt Townsend

 

At a quick glance, Pitt’s
performance in last week’s
Big East Tournament can be
seen as an improvement.
They won a game —— a feat
that eluded them last year,
losing to Boston College 70-
66 in the first round.

Not only did they win,
but they beat Connecticut for
the third time this season 63-
62 in a down—to—the—wire
game that saw the lead
change ﬁve times in the ﬁnal
two minutes.

“It was a hard-fought
game. I was proud of the way
our kids battled back late in
the game,” said Head Coach
Ralph Willard.

Despite leading 38-35 at
the half in their quarter ﬁnal
game against Boston College,
foul trouble and the inability
to rebound at their end sealed
Pitt’s hopes of an NCAA
tournament bid 76-68.

Adorned in their home
jerseys, Pitt exploded in the
first nine minutes against
Connecticut to lead 23-8.
After a 9-0 run to start the

game, the Huskies finally
ended their drought at the
17:20 mark. Senior Jason
Maile and Vonteego
Cummings then hit back-to-
back threes to give Pitt an 11-
point lead.

“We dug ourselves a hole
early. They jumped all over
us, and it took a while for us
to come back from that,” said
Connecticut Head Coach Jim
Calhoun.

With Pitt up 15, Willard
put on a full—court press, and
the Huskies dismantled it
with ease for a dunk.
Connecticut hit a three, and
then Husky guard
Monquencio Hardnett con-
verted a three point play for
three of his 12 first half
points.

Pitt was up 31-20 with
6:46 to play but would only

a score five points in the

remaining half and allow
Connecticut a 10-0 run to tie
the score at 31 with two min-
utes to play.

In the second half, the
teams traded run for run.
Connecticut opened the half
with another 10-0 run to go
up nine. Pitt then tallied with

an 12-0 run of their own.
Jordan slammed home a
Kellii Taylor miss to give Pitt
the lead 49-48. ’
Connecticut again came
back to go up 56-51 with 6:44
to play. Over the next four
minutes, Taylor and
Cummings each scored four
points. Cummings’ steal and
short jumper gave Pitt the

lead 59-58 with 2:22 to play.
After Connecticut hit two
free throws, Cummings was
stuffed in the lane, and the
ball found its way to Taylor
for a open three. Taylor
missed, but the Husky
rebound try went off his foot,
giving Pitt the ball with 51.6
seconds to play. On the

Panther gra

:_Br' n Kna 'sh

While many Pitt students were
spending their spring breaks lay-
ing on a beach or resting lazily at
home, the Panther wrestling team
wrapped up a second-place finish
at the annual Eastern Wrestling
League tournament held Saturday
and Sunday at Clarion University.

The Panthers, who finished
third in the conference during the
regular season, earned 105.5
points to edge out third place
Edinboro by a single point. Lock
Haven clearly dominated the
seven-team tournament by earning
130 points to secure their first-
place finish.

A wrestler must place among
the top three in his weight class in
order to qualify for the NCAA
Championships. Seven out of 10
Panther mat-men qualified, creat-
ing a school record.

P

  

“That was a pretty good per-
formance, finishing second and
sending seven guys to nationals in
one of the toughest conferences in
the country,” Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer said.

Two Pitt grapplers advanced
all the way to the championship
match in their weight classes.
Freshman Rob Loper finished sec-
ond at the 126—pound weight class,
as did junior Mark Bodo at 190.

Bodo rolled to the finals by
way of an 18-3 technical fall in the
first round and a 4-2 win in the
second round. Bodo lost to
Edinboro’s Jason Robinson,
ranked first in the nation, by only
one point in the championship
match. _

_ “I’m not happy with the match;
I wanted to win,” Bodo said. “But
I think I had a good tournament
overall.”

Loper also earned a technical
fall in his first-round match and

plers head to Nationals

followed that up with an 8-6 win
in the semi-finals. Brett Tullo
defeated Loper 6-3 in the champi-
onship match.

With Loper and Bodo as the
only Pitt grapplers to advance to
the finals, the team prospects
appeared pretty bleak early on.
Five Panthers, however, impres-
sively fought their ways through
the consolation bracket to capture
third place finishes and qualify for
nationals.

“All the guys who wrestled
back to get third deserve a lot of
credit,” Assistant Coach Dan
Payne said. “That’s not an easy
thing to do.”

The third place finishers
include Chad Jesko (134), Kevin
Johnson (150), Jacob Schaus
(158), John Withrow (167), and
Bryan Matusic (177).

Other Panther finishers includ-
ed Jonathan Hazi (4th at 118),

The door closes on another
disappointing year for Ladies

_ Pat Robertson

 

 

The Pitt women’s basketball team

bowed‘ out early in the Big East_

Tournament to Miami University 64-50
last week.

The Lady Panthers had hoped to
repeat their surprising tournament per-
formance from last year, but it just was
not in the cards. Last year they were the
No. 13 seed, but they surprised everyone
and advanced to the semiﬁnals before
they lost to UConn.

Desma Thomas led the Hurricanes
(14-13) with 14 points. She also dorr1i—
nated the last matchup between these
two teams at the Field House. She hit
two 3—pointers to extend her streak of
consecutive games with a 3—pointer
made to 27.

The teams played in front of the

Lady Panthers’ largest crowd of the sea-
son, 10,027, at Gampel Pavillion on the

campus of the host, UConn.

Octavia Blue and Kym Hope pitched
in with 12 points each to help Miami to
their victory. With the loss, the Lady
Panthers dropped to 8-22 on the season.
Pitt has dropped to 14-46 over the last
two seasons.

Latia Howard again paced Pitt with
25. She made 11 of 22 shots. Michelle
Katkowski was the next leading scorer
for the Lady Panthers with nine.

Pitt again threw the ball away much
more often than did their opponents.
They committed 26 turnovers as opposed
to Miarni’s 16. Miami stole the ball from
Pitt 17 times, and the Lady Panthers
made only nine trips to the foul line.

The Lady Huskies of UConn walked
away with the Big East title once again.
They now march into the NCAA
Tournament as the No. 1 seed. They ﬁn-
ished the season as the top team in the
country in all the polls with a 30-0
record.

“It was the craziest thing I ever
experienced. I had
the choice [based
on a coin ﬂip], and
I chose to go
down,” Matusic
explained. “I
almost got out a
couple of times,
but he locked
hands [illegally],
and the ref didn’t
see it. Then, with
one second left, he looked hands

mat. This time the ref saw it and
gave me the penalty point and the

Matusic explained that Koss
was irate after the match. Koss’
brother stormed onto the mat and
went after Matusic as Koss headed
for the locker room, tearing up
several lockers and breaking six
benches. Both brothers were
arrested.

The NCAA Championships
will be held Mar. 20 through 22 at

will contain 34-35 wrestlers. The
top eight finishers in each will be
crowned All-Americans.

and relative obscurity, respectively. Think of"
it as one last chance to show appreciation —
a fond send-off to three guys who brought
drama and general mediocrity to the ﬁeld
house for four seasons. ~

As the past fades away, the future:
comes into focus. Most Panther diehards‘
saw the national emergence of Vonteego
Cummings at Madison Square Garden last
week via ESPN, but the NIT will bring one
last, live dose of the sophomore’s circus‘
shots and airborne acrobatics. As the team’s

Kellii Taylor and Mark Blount were
right behind him, until the Boston College
game. When Varga and Jordan hit early foul
trouble, the nation was exposed to the awe-
some, raw freshman power that is Issac
Hawkins. Dunking over everything that
moved and grabbing rebounds from twin
towers Mickey Curley and Kostas Maglos,
Hawkins thrilled a Garden audience.

Pitt fans, though, were at home or in
beachfront drinking establishments, trusting
television sets to show Hawkins’ intensity.

live before Midnight Madness (or later,
depending on the mood of University ofﬁ-
cials).

Don’t forget Taylor’s thievery and
Blount’s blocks, either. Freshman Jarrett
Lockhart should see some playing time, and
Kevin Willard will get the opportunity to
atone for his 23-minute, four—point perfor-
mance against the Eagles.

If you still don’t have NIT fever,
remember one last thing — Panther Paul

cising appearance this season.

Trip to the desert leaves Pitt tennis on top of its game

“Jeffry S. Qwen

   

The Pitt women’s tennis team left for

Texas on Mar.l with an 8-2 record, only to
return a week later with three more losses.
But what they brought back to Pittsburgh,
however, can’t be measured in wins and
losses.

“It was good for us to go down to a state
where we knew there would be some good,
hot weather, and to compete against some
tough competition,” said Head Coach
George Deiffenbach.

“We came back playing much better
tennis.”

Pitt’s closest match was a 4-3 loss to
Schreiner College on Mar. 4, and it provided

inbounds, Cummings calmly sank a
jumper. Connecticut then tipped in a
missed shot to go up 62-61 with 25 sec-
onds left. Blount inbounded the ball
quickly to Cummings, who streaked
down court and drained a one—handed
ﬂoater in the lane.

“Vonteego has turned into one of the
premiere guards in the league and has the
conﬁdence in himself to take the pressure
shots,” said Willard.

The Huskies put up a shot with six
seconds left, and tried two put backs
before Blount snatched the rebound to
end the game.

Pitt’s game against Boston College
had the makings of a typical late season
college basketball game. There was the
underdog Panthers, trading jab for jab
with the Big East co—charnpions. There
was also some rough and physical play,
namely Mickey Curley’s ﬂying elbow to
the chops of Chad Varga. Individual play-
ers also took over the game: Cummings
had 20 points and six assists, and BC big
man Danya Abrams led all scorers with
22.

“Danya played great again. He didn’t
win Big East Player of the Year, but I’ve
always considered him the best player in
the league because of all the attention he
receives,” said Boston College Head
Coach Jim O’Brien.

In their last meeting against Boston,
Pitt double—teamed Abrams and forced
him into turnovers and a sub—par, game. In
New York, because of foul trouble to
Pitt’s big men, Abrams saw some single
coverage. When he was double-tearned,
he found the open guy or bullied through
Pitt’s defenders.

“The foul trouble we got into early
hampered us tremendously. They did a
good job feeding Abrams the ball, and he
was a force,” said VV1llard.

Pitt was down just two with three
minutes to play, but late in the game they
couldn’t convert some easy shots, and
BC was clutch from the line to ice the
game.

the only victories the team would get during
the trip.

In singles, no.3 seedAmanda Hoffman,
a junior, defeated Jenni Cobb 6-4, 7-6.
Freshmen Beth Gang and Alison Bucher
also won matches. Gang defeated Wendi
Johnson 7-6, 6-3, and Bucher beat Sarah
Vuillemin 6-0, 6-3. I A

The doubles team of Fran Davis and
sophomore Erin Shalbrack continued to tear
up the court. The duo grabbed its 14th victo-
ry of the season with an 8-6 win over Lisa
Nichols and Shannon Schaefer.

Pitt lost 9-0 to powerhouses Southwest
Texas St. and Texas-San Antonio on Mar. 5
and 6, respectively. Against Southwest Texas
St., Pitt lost despite the courageous efforts of
Shalbrack, Hoffman, and Kalesnik.

Shalbrack lost to Kati Windham 6-1, 2-6, 7-
5, Hoffman was beaten by Aubrey Mika 6-
4, 5-7, 7-6, and Tamara Kalesnik fell to
Tilfany Schmidt 7-5, 6-3.

“I played really well, so I wasn’t disap-
pointed,” Hoffman said of her loss.

Although Pitt failed to record any victo-
ries, the team feels the stiﬂ’ competition will
better prepare them for April’s Big East
Tournament in 

“It brought us a lot closer to our goal of
how we want to play this season,” said
Gang. .

“I think the team did really well,” said

_ Bucher. “We lost but we got experience

playing tough teams. Now we know what
it’s like to play at their leve .”
The trip to the Lone Star State also

allowed the team to spend “quality time”
together. They went horseback riding, spent
a day at the beach, and went out to dinner
every night. A
_“It was really laid—back and relaxing,”
said Bucher, who often spent her afternoons

Panther fielcl star spends spring break in the winners’ circle

Pitt Track Head Coach Steve
Lewis was more upbeat than usual
about his team’s season—ending per-

“We had a good one this time,”
he said, grinning.

Actually, the Panthers had two
good ones at last weekend’s NCAA

Championships in Indianapolis.

Senior Angie Martin came
home from the meet an All-
American, and sophomore Trecia
Smith a national champion. The
Pitt women have now had an indoor
national champion for three
straight years.

Smith nearly won two events.
After winning the long jump with a
school—record performance of 21-

big meet was a week earlier at the
regional championship meets. The
women placed second at the
Eastern College Athletic
Conference (ECAC) Championship
meet at Dartmouth. George Mason
easily won the meet with 107.5
points. Pitt had 68.5.
The Panthers were
paced by their two
All-Americans.
Smith’s fourth-place
finish in the high
jump (5-7 3/4) and
her victories in the
pentathlon (4058
points) and long and
triple jumps (20—9
1/4 and 44-4, respec-
tively) earned her
Most Valuable Performer honors at
the meet.

The strongest event for Pitt was
the 800 meters. Martin won the
race with a time of 2:09.38.
Freshman Chantee Earl was fifth

with 2:13.15. Martin and Earl,
along "with juniors Anna Kohler and
Amy Francy, earned a third place
finish with their 9:07.12 perfor-
mance in the two—mile relay.

The men ended their season
with somewhat less fanfare. At the
Intercollegiate Association of
Amateur Athletes of America
(IC4A) Championship meet at
Princeton on March 1-2, Pitt fin-
ished in 27th place with 12 points.
Georgetown won the regional team
championship, scoring 81 points.

The Panthers were led by senior
captain Orrel Green. Green was
eighth in the 55—meter hurdles with
8.21 seconds and fifth in the 500
meters with 1:04.70. Also in the
500 meters, Carl Taylor concluded
his rookie season in style, finishing
seventh in 1:04.87.

Rounding out Pitt’s scorers was
Scott Curry. Curry placed eighth in
the 1000 meters with a time of
2:29.55.
