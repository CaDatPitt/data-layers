Thursday night Pitt students
attended a forum to try to get
answers from administrators
concerning accusations of
police brutality last weekend,
but many left with as many
questions as when they came.

“What I saw that night
scared me,” graduate student
Rachel Bower said. “And it
could happen to any one of us
here. They’re still going to see
a black face first and ask ques-
tions later.”

"University administrators
responded to complaints by
Bower and several other stu-
dents who testified at the
forum, sponsored by the
National Society of Black
Engineers and the Black
Action Society.

According to members of
the NSBE, the organization
was meeting near the William
Pitt Union the evening of April
1 for a bowling trip when they
were caught up in a fight

which resulted in the arrest of

12 people, six of whom were

Most of the accusations of
abuse were directed toward
the city police, whose chief
declined an invitation to the
forum.

“A lot of statements were
made about police, police,
police,” Pitt Interim Public
Safety Director Walter Waters
said. “True, you are Pitt stu-
dents, but you are also living
in the city of Pittsburgh. With

all the accusations that have
been made —— police brutality,
excessive force, racial slurs —
not one has been attributed to
campus police.”

Coyne says health care plan almost complete

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer .

Pennsylvania State Senator Bill Coyne
said the United States will probably have a
national health care plan by the end of this
year.

“There are probably six proposals at the
national level right now. I think we are
going to have a plan by the end of the
year,. combining elements of each of the
plans,” he said during the Colloquium of
Political and Health Care Reform Friday in
the Graduate School of Public Health.
Coyne said hopes are to have the project
completed be September.

“If I were to give a percentage of how far
we are on the project, I would say 30 per-
cent, with the other 70 percent to be fin-
ished by September of this year,” he said.

Coyne said although specific provisions
of the plan have not yet been decided, the
plan will offer universal coverage.

“Clinton said he would veto anything
that is not universal. I think that is to his
benefit,” he said.

Also speaking at the colloquium were
Jack Tye, who aided Governor Casey in
developing his Pennsylvania Health
Security Act, and Pitt Professor of Health
Services Administration Beaufort J.
Longest.

Tye said there were three main points
considered in developing Casey’s health
care plan.

“First, we focused on universal coverage
and regional approved cost shifting. We
tried to look at it from a political standpoint
but also put it on a level that would not
erode our position.

“Second, we spent a lot of time on the
bill making sure individuals would have
physician choice on it.

“Third, we looked at malpractice reform.
This is a small part of the problem but a big
part of the debate over health care. Both
local and federal governments have includ-

Leader says
Women
must work
for change
in politics
By Sam Gresoek

News Assistant

Women must work to “change
the face of American politics,”
according to National Women’s
Political Caucus leader Harriett
Woods.

“There is no way to share power
as a bystander,” Woods said.
“Someone is going to have to
make decisions in this countiy.”

Woods, a former Missouri state
lieutenant governor, spoke about
women’s roles in improving
American politics Friday at the

Holiday Inn-University Center in»

Oakland.

According to NWPC figures,
women currently make up 10 per-
cent of the U.S. Congress and 20
percent of state legislatures. In
1971, 5 percent of Congress mem-
bers and 5 percent of state legisla-
tors were women.

Though men still make up the
majority of Congress and state leg-
islatures, Woods said the
increased’ participation of women
in politics has given the American
government some much—needed
diversity.

“What a difference it makes to
have a greater participation of
voices in making the decisions,”
Woods said.

“All issues are women’s issues,”
she said. “But there is a difference
between just supporting or under-
standing issues and providing
leadership on them.”

After being elected NWPC presi-
dent in 1991, Woods said her goal
was to help increase women’s visi-
bility in government.

“We had to make sure that
women moved inside where they
would make the decisions,”
Woods said.

“Our voice wasn’t that visible [at

Male elected co-president of Campus Women's Organization

By Jennifer Sikora
Staff Writer

One man and one woman
will lead the Campus Women’s
Organization next year, follow-
ing the election results on
Thursday.

Scott Dolin and Stephanie
Sudzina, both first—year stu-
dents, will serve as co-presi-
dents and will begin their duties
in the fall. The two ran unop-
posed, and members of CWO
approved the new officers by

ballot during the final meeting
of the year.

Dolin said a male co-presi-
dent for CWO shouldn’t be
unexpected. “I’m very excited,
actually.”

According to current CWO
co-president Bianca Stoner,
Dolin is the first male to hold
the organization’s presidential
position. Stoner said the CWO
has traditionally divided the
presidency in half.

“I love this cause we’re
involved with,” said Sudzina, a

political science major. “I hope
to make it as active as it was this
year.” Sudzina said she hopes
that more males will become
involved with CWO in the
future.

“I was a little apprehensive
[about running] at first because
I’m a first-year student,” said
Dolin. “But once I thought
about it, I thought it would be a
good opportunity.” Dolin, who
majors in philosophy, film stud-
ies and English writing, said he
did not hesitate from running

for president because he was a
man.

Senior Howard Goodman
said male membership shows
that the organization is open to
both sexes. Goodman, a one-
year member, said he thinks
Dolin and Sudzina will do a
good job. “I’ve known both of
them all year  T hey’ve both
been very active, they’re very
well-spoken. They have an
agenda for next year.”

Dolin said some of his plans
for next year include more

speakers and lecturers, informa-
tion tables and working with
the Student Government Board
on the sexual harassment poli-
cy.

Sudzina said her plans
involve campus safety projects
and continuing the Take Back
the Night march. Both Sudzina
and Dolin said they want more
people to realize that anyone is
invited to the CWO meetings.

Another goal is promoting
better attitudes for women’s

Committees crea tedfor
1995's dance marathon

By Marc Miller
Staff Writer

The tables were being set up, the band began playing and
people awaited enthusiastically for the event to start.

Thursday was the day for people to sign up for committees
for the campus-wide dance marathon scheduled for April 7,
1995.

The money raised from the dance marathon will go to
Family House, “a home away from home” for families staying
with somebody who is being treated for a life—threatening ill-
ness.

‘ According to Sonya Shumway, director of public relations
and development at Family House, the dance marathon will
be similar to an annual event at Penn State.

“We are looking for participation from everybody,”
Shumway said.

Representatives from Pitt’s Student Government Board
were among those participating.

“It’s good to incorporate Greeks and non-Greeks into
something that everybody can participate in,” SGB board
member Julie Crowell said. Family House will also be next
year’s Greek Week charity.

There were many different committees to sign up for, one
of them being the morale committee. SGB board member
Deena Buchanan said her job was to “keep the morale up of
the dancers during the marathon.”

“It’s just a word to agitate
people,” said Dolin. “It’s an
incorrect use of the word
‘Nazi,”’ which is rightist and
feminism is leftist, he said.

“A feminist is just simply a
person who believes in equality
for women and men,” said
Sudzina.

“ICWOI is just trying to be a
voice for women who feel
strongly in these issues and
hopefully give women a place
where they can find their identi-
ty, their strength and their pur-
pose.”

Sudzina said she is worried
about measuring up to the past
year’s success.

“ICWOI really made a lot of
progress, a lot of headway.
They really made a name for

themselves. People know who '

CWO is now,” she said. “I think
we’re gonna have our work cut
out for ourselves to follow in
[Shira Hassan and StOner’sI foot-
steps.”

“One of the things we’ve
done most effectively is become

 NEWSI, Monday, April‘ 11, 1994

known,” said current co—presi-
dent Hassan, citing increased
membership and more press
coverage as evidence of suc-
cess. She also said a proud
achievement was attaining an
office in the William Pitt Union.

During the meeting, Hassan
was elected to the new position
of administrative director.

She said that after a year of
forming liaisons with adminis-
tration and faculty, ‘‘I feel it’s an
important position for me to
maintain.”

As administrative director,
Hassan said, she will continue
to push past projects, such as
establishing a Women’s Studies
degree at the university, and
transportation issues.

Hassan said she thinks Dolin
and Sudzina will do a fine job
as co-presidents.

Stoner’s advice to the newly
elected officers was to “prepare
for a lot of hard work. And
fun.”

The election of CWO’s busi-
ness managers was postponed
until the fall semester.

presented by Chapter Vice
President Christopher Capers,
the NSBE requested full internal
investigations and an explana-
tion from the campus and city
police for their actions that
night. In addition, NSBE
requested a public apology and
“financial compensation for
monetary loss” from both police
departments.

“The university  takes seri-
ously the concerns of African-
American students and takes
seriously what happens on this
campus,” Pitt Executive Director
of Public Affairs Leon Haley
said. “There is a commitment to
justice and an educational envi-
ronment which is appropriate.”

He said Pitt will form a com-
mittee to make a recommenda-
tion to the chancellor on “avoid-
ing these types of incidents in
the future.”

BAS chair Keith Davis
slammed Public Safety for not
standing up for students. He
said police were not protecting
but violating the rights of stu-

dents who pay tuition to sup-

port this university.

Brian Morrison, a member of
the NSBE, said racial remarks
were repeatedly made by police
during the incident.

“We were not involved, we
had nothing to do with this and
the initiators [of the fight] had
gone by this time,” Morrison
said. He said he told police that
the NSBE was not involved, but
was still told by police to get off
the campus.

According to Morrison, a per-
son with him was arrested
because they had confronted
the officers about the abuse.

“I feel the police officer had a
personal vendetta against me
and the person who was arrest-
ed,” said Morrison, who also
said police would have arrested
him if given the opportunity.

Assisstant Director of Public
Safety Gary Moses said he is try-
ing to put all of the information

together in order to know what
happened. He said whenever an
incident happens on campus, it
is inevitable that students may
appear involved.

“Across the board, when the
police come down  I tell our
our students to leave because
we don’t know who is a Pitt stu-
dent and who isn’t,” Moses said.

Morrison said he does not
think the matter is being han-
dled correctly.

“[The police] are looking at it
as being in the wrong place at
the wrong time,” Morrison said.
“I feel it was more than that.”

' Moses said those who criticize
the actions of the city police
may not know all that happened

before the fight in the union.

“I want everybody to realize
there was a start of this in the
union Assembly Room which no
one here witnessed,” Moses
said. He said a very large fight
broke out which every campus
police officer was summoned to
that area for, leaving city police
to deal with much of the territo-
ry outside of the union.

Charles Lockler, the national
leader of the NSBE, said the
campus police did make an
effort to help, but students
should make sure the university
is not just treating the incident
with lip service.

“This turnout shows you are
concerned,” Lockler told stu-

dents. “The fact that the univer-
sity has not been commenting is
just politics  everyone knows it
was wrong. Don’t let it get
reduced to a case of ‘wrong
place at the wrong time.”

Carmen Stockton, president-
elect of NSBE, said it appears as
though the university is making
an effort to fulfill their obligation
of resolving this issue.

“I expect the committee to
work with our organization as
well as the entire campus to
resolve this situation with city
police,” Stockton said. However,
she said the committee should
have more than one student
member, which is the present
plan.

ed it in their proposals. Also,
abortion was included on a
neutral stance because on
that issue, it’s hard to please
anybody.”

“We didn’t look at
Medicare because it’s a fed-
eral service. We included no
opting out by employers,” he
said.

Longest said because he is
not part of the political sys-
tem, he was able to offer a
different viewpoint on health
care reform.

“We’re here talking about
this subject because today it
is the most important public
policy issue. There is an eco-
nomic imperative involved
with health care reform,” he
said.

“Health care costs have
consumed an additional 1
percent of the Gross National
Product every 35 months for
the past five years. We have
a real and consequential
problem in which all ideas
pushing toward health care
reform must be based.”

that timel.”

Woods said the 1991 Senate
confirmation hearings of
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas increased
women’s awareness of politics,
since women were largely
underrepresented during the
hearings.

“Suddenly people began to
pay attention to who was not
there [meaning the women] and
said, ‘We’ve got to change,”’
Woods said.

“It gave great impetus to what
came to be called ‘the year of
the woman’ in American poli-
tics.”

According to Woods, women
made a great deal of political
progress in 1992, a year in
which 24 women were elected
to Congress for the first time
and the number of women in
the U.S. Senate tripled.

Woods attributed the
progress to retirement of long-
time office-holders, congres-
sional redistricting and prepara-
tion and hard work by the
women involved in the cam-
paigns.

“1992 was a year of opportu-

nity that was seized by women
who were well—prepared and
who had the capacity to put
together good campaigns,” she
said.

“The new women entering
Congress clearly felt a mandate
to bring about change.” '

Woods said women’s recent
progress in government, partic-
ularly in higher—level positions,
should serve as inspiration for
women considering entering
politics.

“It makes such a tremendous
difference to see women in
defense, finance and law
enforcement,” Woods said. “Its
astonishing, and I hope it’s
inspiring to women in this
country, especially young
women.”

According to Woods, guber-
natorial seats will be up for
election in 36 states this fall.
Woods said this could prove to
be a “great opportunity” for
women candidates, since state
governors often move on to
bigger and better things.

“lFema1e gubernatorial candi-
dates] are extremely important,
because three of the last five
U.S. presidents were [former]

governors,” Woods said.

“People always say, ‘When
are we going to have the first
woman president?” Woods
said.

“First, we’ve got to have
women who are in position to
be considered credible candi-
dates.”

Woods said NWPC will be
doing what it can to help
women become credible candi-
dates for public office through
promotion, education and train-
ing.

“We are going to have to do
some training of one another so
we and the young women
understand the ways you can
earn credentials and gain
knowledge  and get some-

Failing grade

There is a new grading system being considered by
various schools around the country and is currently in
use in at Walker Grant Middle School in Maryland,
according to the Washington Post. The students at
Walker Grant must score above a 78 percent on all
quizzes, tests and papers. If the student doesn’t earn a
score meeting this requirement, they must retake the
test until they do. The idea behind this is to get the stu-
dent to work with the teacher until they master the
material well enough to earn a high enough score.
They can go to school on Saturdays or for an extended
school year in June to complete the material.

This system will have a pernicious effect on the edu-
cational system, although its proponents say it will
allow slower students to have a chance to master mate-
rial without serious penalty. However, students are too
often merely sliding by without putting out their best
effort. This system will encourage more students to try
to slide because they know they will be able to retake
the test until they manage to earn a satisfactory score. It
is reasonable to expect that classes will be slowed by
this system.

According to Katya C. Zablotney, “students learning
under this system will understand that nothing less than
their best effort will be accepted,” (The Washington Post
4/10/94). They are not expected to do things right the
first time and they face no responsibilities for their
work until it is outstanding. People learn from mistakes
as well as from things done well, but this system
attempts to remove the possibility of error. Students
under this system learn that mistakes don’t count, but
are simply something that can be brushed off. Although
students are expectedto learn the concepts they missed
on outside time, are teachers going to be able to keep
up with the demands of the classroom when their out-
side time is devoted to rehashing subjects that should
have already been mastered? '

Employers will not allot time for their workers to
continuously attempt to relearn a skill. Employers
expect assignments to be handled correctly the first
time and often issue punishments for those who do not
perform an adequate job.

In a counterpoint article to Zablotney, Joette Bailey
made the following excellent point: “... is there not a
contradiction of values  in the fact that we consider
lowering our standards of expectation for our students
while simultaneously developing stringent merit evalua-
tions for their teachers” (Washington Post 4/10/94). In
fact, lowering the standards students are held to is what
this is all about. Studentsare expected not to learn, but
eventually absorb at least 80 percent of the material,
and this does not teach them anything.

All  must face the hard questions

Well, it was inevitable. With the opening of
the Holocaust Memorial in Washington, D.C., it
was inevitable that other wronged ethnic groups
would call for their own museum. On the elec-
tronic bulletin board to which I subscribe, one
writer noted that American Indians had suffered
their own genocidal episodes, either starved to
death, or forced to march or just plain massa-
cred. Unlike the Holocaust, the writer said,
Americans were directly responsible for the deci-
mation of an indigenous race, a race that peo-
pled this very continent.

Which is entirely true, and entirely beside the
point.

What’s surprising is that the writer stopped at
Indians. Let’s face it: world history is far more
catastrophic than Treblinka or the Trail of Tears.

years and 6 million lives, justice isn’t possible.

Justice is fairness, making things right. And
fate, with its usual sense of irony, has blended
together the oppressed and the oppressors so
we can’t tell the compromises from the princi-
ples anymore. After SO years, Demjanjuk is now
“one of us” again. So is Lax. But so is Ivan the
Terrible, whoever he was. The Victim and the
Victirnizer — history’s yin and yang.

The Holocaust Memorial is more than a monu-
ment to one culture’s brush with extinction. It is
— and should be — a specific shrine to a
unique crime. But it is also a metaphor of uni-
versal proportions for both Jews and Gentiles,
uniting all of us in the memory of misery. For
every victim of Nazi aggression — Jews,
Gypsies, Polish Catholics, the Russians in
Leningrad — there was someone who caused it,

The Israeli Supreme Court
recently ruled that retired Cleveland autoworker
John Demjanjuk is not “Ivan the Terrible,” the
horrific guard who tortured thousands in the
Treblinka concentration camp. Witnesses and
documentation haven’t provided conclusive
proof; Demjanjuk was either a reluctant guard or
a monster, or somewhere in between. “Who’s to
say?” asks fellow Clevelander Martin Lax, who
raised money for Demjanjuk’s defense. “I might
have done the same thing myself,” Lax says — a
mighty generous insight from someone who sur-
vived Auschwitz, whose parents were killed by
folks not very unlike John Demjanjuk.

Does Demjanjuk deserve proper punishment
for his sins? Certainly. But some people are cry-
ing not for punishment but for “justice.” After 50

The motto of the Holocaust sur-
vivors is simple: Never again. American Indians
—— like Jews, like Armenians, like victims every-

They deserve more than a search for blame,
because finding the guilty is too, too easy. What
they deserve — what we all deserve — is to
confront the black night of hard questions, to
peer into the darkness of our past and see our-
selves among the aggressors and the aggrieved.

If we continue to find solace in'easy cate-
gories — we vs. them, the Nazis vs. the rest of
us —— then all of the memorials in the world will
make one poor fortress when the hatred and the
fighting break out. Again.

Letter to the Editor

As a supporter and observer
Tuesday at the “Pitt off" of Mt.
Graham” protest, I had expect-
ed to see an educational
demonstration of why the area
of Mt. Graham should be saved
and not subjected to another
ecological holocaust. Instead, I
saw the typical 1960s format of
protestation: the hippy
wannabes were there, the New
Agers were there and curious
students such as myself were
also there. But due to the
atmosphere in which the
protest occurred, a large pro-
portion of these people had

come stoned, or were getting
stoned at the protest. Yes, the
echoing rhythm of the drums,
the hippy dancing and the rest
of the ‘60s traditions attracted
that controversial drug which
left a waft of pungent smoke.
This seemed very ironic to me
how we were chanting
“Education, not extinction,” and
everyone was getting high and
forgetting what to yell.
Speaking from a biologist’s
point of view, I applaud the
efforts to save this species and
to preserve the sacred land of
the Apache Indians, but where

was the seriousness in all of
this? Without a seriously edu-
cating demonstration, the
protest is all fun and games
and sadly ineffective. Next
time, get out of the 1960s form
of protest and begin a new
19905 form which will attract a
more serious crowd: one that
isn’t there because it is an
excuse to smoke. Remember,
reality cuts deeper into the soul
of human beings than the
dreamy escape that drugs give.

Fear can be a major motivator!

Pitt will finish the tripleheader
and go for a perfect 9-0 in the
Big East today at 10 a.m., after
Sunday’s scheduled game was
rained out.

Mother Nature was probably
the only thing that could have
stopped the Panthers arsenal in
the first two games.

However, the first game
proved to be the toughest Big
East test so far.

Pitt needed late inning hero-
ics by second baseman Scott
Etsell to win. Tied 1-1 in the
sixth inning, Pitt looked like it
might finally fall in the Big East.

With two outs and no one on,
Danny Gonzalez singled, setting
the table for Etsell. On a first-
pitch fastball, Etsell ripped a
two-run homer down the left
field line that gave Pitt a two-
run cushion going into the sev-
enth.

“I was just trying to get a
good at-bat,” Etsell said of his
home run.

starter Gregg Mrochko said.
“This time it came in the later
innings with Scott’s home run.”

In the top of the seventh,
Wildcat catcher Tom Koerick hit
a leadoff homer to left ﬁeld, but
that was all Villanova could
muster.

Pitt head coach Mark Jackson
brought in stopper Clayton
Beirne, who retired the side in
order to collect his second save
for star starting pitcher
Mrochko.

Mrochko gave up two runs on
only four hits, to up his record
to a ﬂawless 6-0.

“I have a lot more conﬁdence
now than I ever had before,”
Mrochko said. “I just have to
remember to keep doing what
got me here and not ease up or
take it easy just because I had
some success.”

“We have confidence in all
our pitchers,” right-hander
Kevin Kramer said. “But he’s
[Mrochko] got this aura of conﬁ-
dence about him when he
pitches.”

Riding the momentum of their
win in the first game, the
Panthers wasted no time getting
to Villanova pitching early and
often in the second game.

Pedalpns/oers Compete at Pitt

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

Pedal power pushing you tothe edge.
Competitive cycling has come to Pitt in the
form of the Panther Cycling Club, which is
enjoying its inaugural season.

The club was started by second-year med-
ical student Dan Latt. Latt was involved in
cycling at the University of California at San
Diego. When he came here, Latt began riding
with at Carnegie Mellon University bike club
and decided that it was time for one at Pitt. Latt
got together with fellow riders Derek Davis
and“Casey Williams and began the processof
forming the club.

Currently there are about 85 active members
in the club. There are 35 competitors, who
compete in races. The rest are recreational rid-
ers of either mountain bikes or road bikes. The
team has two seasons. In the fall, mountain
bikes are the rage and in the spring the
Panther pedal pushers take to the roads.

“The goals of the club are to coordinate a
collegiate cycling club, network riders to get
them together, create a social atmosphere
around cycling, organize trips and become an
advocate for cycling,” Latt said.

The club is a member of two associations,
the National Collegiate Cycling Association
and the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference.
This affiliation, along with approval from the
United States Cycling Federation, allows the

Panther cycling club to host races. The first of
these was held this weekend at Schenley Park
through a combined effort of the Pitt and CMU
cycling clubs. The riders were placed into divi-
sions based on their abilities. The classes were
Men’s A, B, C, D and Women’s A and B.

The teams that came to compete were Penn
State University (University Park and Behrend
campuses), Mercyhurst College, Lock Haven
University, Bucknell University, Millersville
University and Slippery Rock University.

On Saturday morning the teams competed in
a team time trial at Plaingrove, near Slippery
Rock. It was a fairly easy course considering
what the riders would have to face later that
day. Saturday afternoon’s competition was the
Flagstaff Hill Criterium. A criterium is a short
course race, usually under a mile for each lap.
The Flagstaff course, set in Schenley Park,
proved to be grueling. The course was a four
corner, three-quarter mile lap with a fast
downhill corner and an uphill finish. This
course proved to be too much for some riders,
many of whom pulled out of the men’s C 8: D
race.

“It was a hard race. Everyone is exhausted,”
Pitt’s Dave Fertal said.

The races on Saturday afternoon had to be
combined due to a delay in getting parked
cars cleared from the course. The men’s C-D
race took to the course first. A three-man
breakaway pulled out and never looked back.

See Pedals, page 8

With one out in the first
inning, Gonzalez singled and
Etsell followed with a double.
One batter later, Tyler Shantz,
fresh off being named Big East
Player of the Week, launched a
two-run homer to right-center
field. The next batter, Ken
Strish, mirrored Shantz’s shot
with one of his own. _

‘We came out, scored a lot of
runs and set the tempo,” Etsell
said. “We just played our game,
and when we play our game we
are successful.”

“We jumped on them early,”
Jackson said. “That sometimes

“They were
definitely out for
revenge,” defense-
man John Foris
said.

“This was the
best game of the

College by a final
of 8-3.

This is the same Loyola team
that Pitt knocked off in last
year’s National Collegiate
Lacrosse League Championship
by rallying to tie the game
with 55 seconds left and
eventually winning in
overtime.

So coming into yesterday's
championship game the two
teams were definitely familiar
with each other, not to mention

real big. Everyone was playing
defense, even the short-stick
middies.

"We played against a team
that is very explosive and likes
to score in bunches, but we
were able to keep them in
check,” Foris added. ,

Pitt was able to keep not only
Loyola but all of its opponents
in check throughout the tourna-

ment.

Friday night they opened
up by trouncing
Shippensburg 17-0, with Josh
Gochnauer contributed six

goals to the cause.
Saturday they played two
games.

The team faced off against
rival Penn State and pretty
much dominated the game
from start to ﬁnish, going on
to Win 17-2.

Once again Josh
Gochnauer was the leading
scorer with four goals and an
assist, and Chris Rice also
added to the attack with
three goals and an
assist.

Their second game of the
day was against the
University of Buffalo and

was much more
competitive, as the final was
8-5.

The win qualified the
Panthers for the A bracket
semifinals, where they
would once again face Penn
State.

Penn State played Pitt
much tougher the second
time but still couldn’t defeat
them.

The final this time was 10-
3.
The win qualified Pitt for
the matchup against Loyola
yesterday.

“This will not be the last
time we play Loyola,”
Jeff Shaner said.

“We will most likely face
them again in the
league championship.”

The pack attempted to give
chase but the break was too
strong.

Winning the men’s C—D race
was Mike Hertner of Penn State.
Behind him were Mark
Mcjunkin of CMU and Sean
Davis of Pitt.

Other results from Saturday’s
races were in the Men’s A class.
Finishing first was Christian
Fischer from Slippery Rock.
Coming in second was Chuck
Dedmarczyk of Penn State and
in third was Greg Bachman
from Slippery Rock. Notable fin-
ishers for Pitt were Craig Coles
in sixth and Casey Williams in
ninth.

In women’s action at the
Criterium, Amy Thompson of
CMU won and Catherine
Hawthorne from Slippery Rock
finished second.

On Sunday the teams were
once again back at Schenley
Park for another grueling
course. This time, however,
Mother Nature did not cooper—
ate and proceeded to get the
racers more than just wet
behind their ears. Sunday’s
course was a 1.75 mile loop in
Schenley Park.

Each loop consisted of a
steady climb (approximately
three quarters of a mile in
length) and a long winding
descent with a wide 180—degree
turn.

“Everyone was in good spirits
despite the weather," Williams
said.

"There were some strong fin-
ishes in the Men’s C-D race and
the women all stayed close
together. It was a good experi-
ence for everyone who partici-
pated."

In the second inning, Pitt hit
the ‘Cats for ﬁve more runs.

Jason Conti and Bob Miller
singled and then Craig Crawley
singled Miller in. The inning
was capped by Shantz’s second
consecutive two-run homer.

Just as they did to UConn’s
ace, the Panthers sent
Villanova’s No. 1 pitcher David
Herr to the showers in the sec-
ond inning.

“The last time we faced Herr
he really shut us down,”
Jackson said. “We did a good
job being patient and getting
good at—bats, and we were able
to score some runs off him.”

Two more runs in the third
gave Pitt an 11—run bulge.

To lead off the fifth, Josh
Tyler spanked his team-leading
fourth home run of the year
(tied with Etsell).

Starting pitcher Tedde
Campbell brought a two-hit
shutout into the sixth inning
when Villanova exploded for
seven runs —— closing the gap to
18-7. ’

The inning prior to that,
Campbell struck out the side.

“I think he got a little tired,”
Jackson said. “He’s had some
physical problems the last cou-
ple weeks, but it hasn’t affected
his velocity.

“He lost some concentration
which most people do when

they are up a lot of runs.”

Kramer finished the game,
pitching 3 2-3 innings. He fed
the ‘Cats a steady diet of curve-
balls as he stymied them for no
hits and no runs.

“Coach called for a lot of
curveballs, which set up my
fastball,” Kramer said.

Even with a 13—run lead,
Jackson still had his team
bunting and stealing.

“We continue to run because

that’s our offense,” Jackson said.
“It’s in no way to degrade a
team. To stop bunting and steal-
ing would stop our offense.

“It’s out of respect because all
these teams are good and they
can put up big innings at any
time.”

Pitt stole 10 bases in the sec-
ond game —- six of them com-
ing from first baseman Crawley.
He also went four-for—five with
three RBI and three runs scored.
