Student Government candidates share platforms

The following are the platforms of the
eight candidates vying for the vacant
Student Government Board slot.
Candidates will answer student questions
at an open forum tomarrow at 2p.m. in
Dining Room A of the William Pitt Union.

Stephanie Bacine:

“I am running for Student Government
Board because I would like to create a
more open and accessible communication
link between the Student Government
Board and the university community.

“In reality, too many students are unaware
of the programs implemented by the
Student Government Board. I feel that
better public relations would effectively
increase the opportunity for students to
become more informed and thus potentially
more involved with Student Government
Board programs.

“I believe that making a persistent effort
in bridging this gap would be my
responsibility as a board member, to take
a pro—active approach toward the students
for their opinions, responses and ideas.

“A method of a pro—active representative
would be an individual that will go and
interact with students, rather than having
the students come to them.”

Kevin Docherty:

“Last semester I decided to get involved
with the governmental relations
committee. My interest in this committee
was due to its involvement in trying-to
save Engine 14, the first-due engine at
fires at Pitt.

“My interest in this was due to my being
an active volunteer fire fighter with the
fourth—busiest fire department in the state,
the Reading fire department.

“Mayor Sophie Masloff wants to
eliminate Engine 14, and I feel that this
would severely endanger the Pitt
community. Through my experience as a
fire fighter, I know how important it is to

"have a fire engine respond quickly, and

I know that the mayor’s plan wouldmean
more property loss and maybe even the
loss of lives. We cannot let this happen!

“Public safety is a very important issue
to the students of this university, but it
means more than just the campus police
and crime. If I am appointed to SGB, my
priority will be the complete safety of the
students of this university.

“Public safety would be my main
concern, but I am also interested in other
things that affect Pitt students. The

conditions of many of Pitt’s classrooms is
a disgrace, and some of them do not
provide an atmosphere congruent to
learning.

“I am also interested in students’ concerns
about the residence halls, and I feel that
my experience as a [resident assistant]
would help me work with the Housing
Office to try to improve the living situation
of a great number of Pitt students.

“I promise that if I am selected to Student
Government Board, I will do everything I
can to improve the quality of life for
students at Pitt.”

Joseph M. Foner:

“Last year I served on the governmental-
relations committee, the student-relations
committee, and I was the Freshman Council
business manager. Service on these
committees has given me a working
knowledge of the SGB as well as permitted
me to exchange thoughts and ideas with
the current board.

“I am running because I want to “open
up” the SGB and make it more accessible
to students by getting a bigger SGB meeting
room. I also plan to use extensive surveys,
with the help of the SRC, to find out what
students want.

“I would like to establish “get to know
the board member” meetings that will
more directly apprise students of our
progress as well as let them express
thoughts and wishes directly to us.

“These ideas would enable me to set up
more programs that would let the SGB
better serve the student body."

Linda Kazmerski:

“The Student Government Board needs
candidates to represent students, not
candidates to represent the organizations
in which they are members of. Yes, I have
been involved in several student
organizations, but as a candidate for board,
I am a student who wants to represent all
students, not just these specific groups.

“I have gained valuable leadership skills
throughout my involvement in
organizations and the community, and I
feel that I can be an achiever of student
needs and a responsible student
representative.”

Kevin Leckerman:

“I am running for the open position on
the Student Government Board. I am a
sophomore and a brother at Pi Lambda

Phi fraternity. I have worked extensively

Free refreshments and 40
health—related information tables
were available for Pitt students
and faculty at the annual Health
Fair held yesterday in the William
Pitt Union.

About 2,000 people attended
the “Elect a Healthy U. ‘in ’92" fair,
sponsored by the Student Health
Service. -Guest appearances were
made by the Pirate Parrot and Pitt
Panther.

“It was interesting and there
were a lot of fun things to do. I
learned I’m out of shape, though.
I had my eyes checked and [the
strength of] my grip checked,”
said ’ f1rst—year student Meredith
Balsam.

First-year student Ann Trevellini
found the fair informative and
said she overcame her stage fright
by participating in the aerobics
demonstration.

‘‘I learned a lot at the organ
donor table,” she said. “In fact
I’ve decided I want to be an
organ donor myself.”

Health educator Shirley
Haberman said she was pleased
that so many people attended
and she hoped they picked up
some valuable information.

“This is a campus-wide event
that gives students and faculty
the opportunity to gain
knowledge and increase their
awareness about disease

prevention, alcoholism, oral
hygiene and many other health-
related services at Pitt’s campus
and the surrounding community.
We’re trying to encourage people
to adopt healthier lifestyles,"
Haberman said. ’
Physical education teacher Beth
Sussman and some of her students

‘ put on an aerobics demonstration

to let students know about the
classes offered for credit.

“It’s not a stressful class. We
just do it to have fun,” she said.

Nutritional information was
available at the Allegheny County
Health Department booth. The
registered nurse handed out
pamphlets about eating disorders,
alcohol and general information
on subjects like weight control.
Students could also test their
cholesterol, blood pressure and
body—fat percentage.

The slgn—language performance
group Beautiful Hands signed
and danced to different Top 40
songs and taught the audience a
few signs.

Jeremiah McAuliffe, a
substance-abuse prevention
specialist, explained that the fair
doesn’t “reduce health to just the
physical. It’s all aspects of health
promotion."

The fair offered gift bags with
mouthwash, toothbrushes, dental
ﬂoss, nail clippers and first-aid
kitsfRefreshments such as apples,
popcorn, and mocktails (with
recipes) were also available.

Pitt pro-life
group gathers
at DC. rally

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Pro—life activists walked out on .
a conference with Sen. Harris
Wofford at the national March for
Life yesterday in Washington,
D.C., which was attended by
about 25 Pitt students.

The march marked the 19th
anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade
Supreme Court decision which
legalized abortion in the United
States. »

Students for Life President
Melissa Collins described the rally
as “re—affirming” but said the
conversation with Wofford (D.-
Pa.) was “a total waste of time”
because he evaded most of their
questions. Collins and SFL
member Joel Garrett said they
had never heard of people
walking out on a politician before.

Thousands of marchers
attended the rally yesterday. “I’ve
gone every year since I was four,
and I've never seen it this
crowded," Collins said.

Collins said protesters carried
signs which read, “I'm Pro-Choice A
(NOT)” and “Abortion Stops a
Beating Heart. ” They also chanted
“Hey, hey, ho, ho, Roe v. Wade
has got to go," and “Pro—choice,
that’s a lie. Babies do not choose
to die,” according to Garrett.

Associate dean expert
in East Asian studies

By Jennifer Sozio
For The Pitt News

Professor Katheryn Linduffs interest in Chinese art and
archaeology was sparked during her college years, which
coincided with the Vietnam War. As a pacifist disturbed by the
war, Linduff began to examine Asia’s history. She eventually
decided upon China as her focus for study.

Linduff is associate dean of academic affairs in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences and is also a professor in the anthropology
and fine arts departments. She specializes in the Shang. and
Chou dynasties.

“China andjapan are in the news so much now it would be
unthinkable not to know something about them,” Linduff said.

Linduff first traveled to the Chinese mainland in 1978, the first
time China opened its doors to the outside world. She returns
to China each year. Before traveling to China’s mainland,
Linduff visited Taiwan numerous times. She studied Mandarin
Chinese and can speak the language ﬂuently.

As a graduate student Linduff did research at Taiwan Normal
University. Beginning her education at Dickinson College in
Carlisle, Pa., she later traveled to Taiwan.

She received her doctorate in art history from the University
of Pittsburgh and went on to attain a post-doctoral fellowship
in archaeology and anthropology at Harvard University.

Fears that study abroad is too
expensive or not useful are easily
rebuffed by veterans of the
program.

“You come out with an
awareness you could never gain
from a book or a class. You learn
about family, social and political
culture points that’ you didn't
ever knew existed,” said Pitt
student Mark Seaman, who
studied in France.

David Schurz, who went on
Semester at Sea before spending
a year injapan, said study abroad
helped him gain “a greater
appreciation for the globalization
of our world and perspective on
how your studies fit in, {plus} a
better career focus and feeling of
responsibility.” ’

abroad, but Pitt-sponsored

Pitt communications chair
enjoys passion for teaching

By Diana McLaughlin

For The Pitt News

You can only be a. good teacher “if you're
teaching something you’re really passionate about,”
according to communications Professor Henry Krips.

Although he has “no traditional background in
communications,” Pitt’s new chair of the
communications department researched many
aspects of the subject before settling into his
present position.

Originally interested in philosophy, Krips was
advised to study science because it was thought to
be strongly related to the arts. “Science was the way
to find out about the world,” Krips said.

He accepted this theory and majored in physics
at Adelaide College in Australia, where he “kept on
waiting to get so bad at [science] that I’d be able to
stop doing it.”

But he found college-level science to be more
enjoyable and eventually attained his doctorate in
theoretical physics. Afterwards he went back to get
his degree in humanities. '

Once out of college, he taught at the University
of Melbourne as a philosopher of science. From
there his interests branched out. He began to set up
a technique of literary analysis to study myths and
their relation to science and applied these techniques
to aspects of popular culture, such as advertisements.

In the last three to four years, he decided to apply
literary analysis and rhetoric analysis to scientific
texts. This new program in the rhetoric of science
is the first project Krips intends to set up at Pitt.

Krips first came to Pitt 17 years ago as a junior
faculty member, giving lectures during Australia's
off—term. He said he was attracted to Pitt because its
departments of history and philosophy of science
were “the best in the world."

The next year he taught in Cambridge, England.
He continued there until about two years ago,
when the English system became “non-supportive
to education.”

Krips then returned to Pitt and became highly
interested in its rhetoric program.

He has been here since the end of June and said
he is able to understand both sides of the
communications department, rhetoric comm-
unication and communication disorders, because
of his background in both science and humanities.

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Peter
Koehler said Krips was hired because “he spans, in
a unique way, the two rather distinct parts of the
department.” Koehler also said Krips was determined
as “best person for the job” after a two—year search.

Krips’ goals as chair include his rhetoric of
science program and strengthening ties with the
film program and the center of philosophy of
science.

Pitt’s Quo Vadis more
than just tour guides

By Kelli Herd
For T be Pitt News

Hidden behind the main elevators on the first floor ‘of the
Cathedral of Learning is an organization that is probably one of
the university’s best—kept secrets.

Quo Vadis, Latin for “whither goest thou” or “where are you
going,” consists of 25 students who give guided tours of the ,
Nationality Rooms located on the first and third floors of the
Cathedral.

The group has existed for over 40 years, according to Quo
Vadis adviser Barbara Myers, who said QV was established in
1938 when the Russian, Swedish, German and Scottish Nationality
Rooms were completed.

Today, there are 23 Nationality Rooms, and QV guides are
responsible for knowing the art, history and architectural
background for each, Myers said.

Myers said the number of guided tours have doubled since
1986. “We get over 30,000 people a year,” she said.

Tours during December are the most popular because each
room is decorated to celebrate the holidays celebrated in each
country and each guide dresses in the native attire of the room.

Quo Vadis members are constantly learning and gaining
experience, Myers said. The group takes at least one weekend
trip a year to a different city to study its cultures; they take tours
of various libraries and museums in the area and each year one
of its members is awarded a scholarship for study abroad.

QV members are also participate in a variety of other
university activities, including escorting VIPs and delegates on

GRO Secretary Christine.

Biancheria said the slur was hate
speech and she would not attempt
to communicate with the person
or persons who wrote it.

“Hate speech does not
encourage dialogue. It just seeks
to intimidate,” Biancheria said.

The Student Bar Association

was equally upset by the slur.
“I don’t have a hard time
condemning it. I find it offensive,

and it lacks a place in any
community,” SBA President Anji
Dumm said.

Biancheria said she does not
plan on pursuing the matter
further for lack of a culprit, but
said, “If I ever gain personal
knowledge of a person
doing that here, I will pursue it to
the maximum disciplinary
limit.”

GRO said an incident like
this has never happened
before.

with student government before
coming to Pitt, but my experience
with college leadership roles is
limited.

“Thus far, I have attained the
position as assistant Inter-
Fraternity Council representative.
I feel that my ability to work with
others, my willingness to listen
to others’ ideas and my ideas for
improvement will qualify me for
this leadership role.

“Two of the more important
problems on campus that need
to be attended to are interracial
relations and campus security.
More programs need to be
instituted to increase racial
awareness and promote
cooperation between all students
at Pitt.

“But seemingly more important
is the need for student protection.
Students should feel safe at all

times of the night anywhere in
Oakland."
David Ott:

“I am a sophomore in the
College of Arts and Sciences and
have held many chairmanships
in the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. I
am also a member of ROTC, the
ROTC fraternity and the
Pathfinders Organization (tour
guide/recruiting).

“I have a very diverse
background and understand the
views of the ROTC members and
the Greek system.

"But I am most of all a student
and understand the problems that
students face. In order to
have change we must have a
plan that will benefit the student
body and not just certain
individuals.

“I have created a process in
order to achieve my goals if
selected. The process is called

MOU: Motivation-Organization-
Unity.

“In order to make Pitt a better
place, students must first follow
MOU. Any idea is only as good as
the students make it.

"Without the support of the
student body, change will be
very difficult.

“Using my MOU method, I have
five goals which I would like to
accomplish:

0 Increase the size of the choice-
dollars program to include more
businesses

-Increase the hours of the
campus shuttle and try and
provide service on the weekends

olncrease hours of operation
for athletic facilities so students
can have more time on sports
equipment

-Expand awareness of
nationalities and cultures in order
for all students to become aware

of the wide diversity on campus

0 Increase security on campus
by expanding the campus police
force and adding more foot
patrols.

If you are looking for results,
then I am your man.”

Shon Robinson:

“If chosen for the Student
Government Board position, I
intend to deal with the following
issues: first is student safety on
and around the university. The
second issue is the problem of
discrimination against
race, religion and sexual
preference by various sectors and
individuals within the university
community.

“I would also like to facilitate
an accurate and thorough way to

evaluate the competence and

quality of our professors’ teaching
ability so that students are able to
get the kind of education we pay
so much for.

"Another issue I would
concern myself with is that
of the university's spending
policy.

“Regarding my personal
qualifications, I have just entered
the first semester of my senior
year at Pitt and I have lived in the
dormitories for my entire
academic career, so I have a
better awareness of the concerns
of the on-campus student.

“However, I also have an
awareness of the off-campus
students’ concern, being that
many of my friends live off-
campus.

“I have not held an ofﬁce in
either of these organizations,
therefore, I feel that if chosen for
the SGB, I shall be able to remain
impartial and avoid conflicts of
interest.

Finally, I must stress that my
main concern is to be accessible
to my fellow students to hear and
discuss their concerns and
suggestions."

“As a sophomore at the
University of Pittsburgh I have
become involved not only
academically but also as a student
concerned with the relationship
between students and

  Making decisions

N The race was on! And then it was over! But wait, there's
‘Tan empty slot! So...now what? Another race for a new
Student Government Board member?

The eight members of the SGB will decide on Friday
who will fill the empty seat left by former member Abbie

Campsie. Following an open forum in which the new

if candidates will present themselves to the SGB and the
university community, the final decision will be made,

ending the first, short-lived SGB controversy of the new
semester. When Campsie resigned from her position two
weeks ago, the search began again and turned up a new
crop of hopefuls.

' Well, not a completely new crop. Defeated candidates

« Linda Kazmerski and Joe Foner have returned to compete
' for the seat they originally ran for last November.

But five others have also sprouted from the woodwork.
Kevin Docherty, Stephanie Bacine, David Ott, Shon
Robinson, Kevin Leckerman and Melissa Smith are the
latest Pitt students who have chosen to apply for the
position.

The one hopeful who stands out from the group is
Melissa Smith, Pitt sophomore and co-president of the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance on campus.

Srnith’s experience proves that she is a responsible’
candidate who understands student needs. Having been
a TA last semester for freshman studies, Smith knows

* what incoming students desire from our campus. Her

involvement with New Student Programs as _a cultural
diversity facilitator makes it clear that she has a deep
knowledge of the vital concerns in situations around Pitt.

Campus safety seems to be a major concern for most of
the applicants. However the campus—safety bandwagon
has given more rides around here than Greyhound. If
there were legitimate, viable options which would change
the condition of safety at Pitt, we would hope that the
Department of Public Safety would have changed.them

  

 

by now if it had the means. However it doesn’t have the »

budget, and that should be the main concern. of the
candidates.

Although safety is the center of controversy around Pitt
these days, there are also other things we complain about
on a daily basis but never seem to get around to doing
anything to change. One of these things is access to
educational materials and facilities which are profoundly

A lacking on a campus as large as this one. ,

Smith has decided to take her opportunity to run for

SGB as a chance to change Hillman Library’s often
., inconvenient hours. The fact that the most centrally
 located library on campus closes its doors to students at
' midnight is ludicrous. Realistically, students do not turn
out their lights and go to sleep at midnight. We don't turn
into pumpkins if we study after 12, but Hillman’s hours
make access impossible to the student who needs to use
its facilities after midnight.

Budgetary concerns are also issues when discussing
extensions of operating hours, but they are alsoissues that
we feel confident Smith will explore and attempt to alter
should she be elected the ninth member of the SGB on
Friday.

Conditions in cafeteria unsanitary

I would just like to bring to the
attention of the general student
body an experience I had at the
Towers Cafeteria on the morning
of 'Ihursday,_Ian. 10. I came down
for breakfast around 7:40 a.m. to
a mostly empty cafeteria. But as I
entered the Tower A side of the
cafe, another student stopped me
and pointed out a large rat eating
crumbs off the ﬂoor in front of
me. I am not at all exaggerating
when I say this rat was about the
size of a small rabbit. Keeping an
eye on it, I went to get my food,
albeit with less of an appetite
than when I arrived. About a
minute later, one of the workers
ended up smashing it with a
broomhandle and killing it. To
the credit of the staff, it was all
cleaned up very well afterwards.
However, I am outraged thatsuch
an event could even occur at all.
To have a large rat living in a
cafeteria where thousands of
students eat every day is just
about as unsanitary a situation as
I can imagine! Is it too much to
ask as a student, that having paid
for a meal plan, I can eat in a
clean, sanitary environment? I've
heard many complaints about
cafe food before, but this is
something totally different and
more serious. [...l A message to
UPDS: Clean up your act!

Clarifying “pro-choice”

“For years, the debate between
pro-lifers and pro-choicers has
raged on concerning a woman’s
right to her body and whether or
not to continue a pregnancy." So
began an unsigned editorial in
the Jan. 21st edition of The Pitt
News. The debate between pro-
lifers and pro-abortionists has
raged on concerning a woman's
rights to kill her child before it is
born. The scientific evidence
clearly defines the unborn child
as a unique human being, so the
question is not over “a woman’s
rights over her own body.” The
question is whether a woman
should be allowed to have the
child killed before it is born.

In stating that someone is “pro—
choice,” one should make the
distinction of what choice they
support —— in this case the choice
is whether an unborn child dies
or lives. Unfortunately, this paper,
like most others, continues to
phrase the debate in exactly the
terms that abortionists like: those
that evade or otherwise cloud the
issue.

'l'hank you for speaking out
against the Blue Cross policy that
would limit women to a single
day in the hospital after giving
birth. On the support of women
who choose life, both pro-lifers
and pro-abortionists can easily
agree.

Missing the point

I am writing in response to
Adam Richter’s article entitled,
“Health insurance confuses even
the best of us.” I was wondering
how long it took Richter to write
his column. Ten, maybe fifteen
minutes? Obviously not too long
since he throws around more
innuendoes than facts and would
rather attempt to humor us instead
of addressing the situation at
hand.

Last summer I interned at an‘

independent insurance agency.
In June I became licensed in the
state of Pennsylvania to sell
property and casualty insurance,
and I hope I can shed some light
on the situation.

Many people feel that the “Pay
or Play” plan might be the most
beneficial way to fund this
program. Don't jump on the
bandwagon yet. The “Pay or P1ay”
program would require
businesses to provide health
insurance to all their employees
or pay a sizeable tax. (Sorry
Richter, you really missed the
point.) The obvious losers in the
setup are the small to medium-
sized businesses that would find
the cost of the program

overwhelming. Requiring
businesses to offer health
insurance is an extremely
expensive proposition. Consider
this: Insuring a small to medium-
sized group (10 to 50 employees)
can cost an employer, depending
on the coverages and deductibles
chosen, respectively, between
$5,000 and $25,000 per month.
Placing these laws upon
businesses will not help stimulate
our economy, and they may create
a tremendous barrier to anyone
attempting to entering any type
of business proposition.

Rectify disorganization

At‘ Wednesday’s screening of
“JFK,” there was an enormous
lack of organization displayed by
the Pitt Program Council. The
PPC does provide many activities
for students, however there is no
excuse for situations such as this
getting out of hand. The PPC
advertised to “...come early,
seating is limited.” Our gripe is in
the fact that we arrived by’6:15
p.m. and stood in line for 45
minutes while the David
Lawrence lobby became
overcrowded, and PPC members
did nothing about it. As soon as
the doors opened, there was a
total disregard for the early
arrivers. There was inexcusable
pushing and shoving, and it’s a
wonder no one was injured. The
PPC, we're sure, anticipated a
great crowd, yet took no measures
in controlling the chaos.

For future screenings, may we
suggest allowing students to enter
the auditorium earlier, or passing
out tickets to students in line
prior to opening the doors. This
would be fair to the students
taking the time to arrive over an
hour in advance and being
refused a seat because they didn’t
exert enough force to get to the
ticket center.

Mourning

Georgetown

By Derek Willis
Sports Editor

It wasn’t the contested shots
that hurt Pitt last night against
Georgetown, but the uncontested
ones. The Panthers missed 12 of
26 shots from the free throw line,
and the Hoyas won the Civic
Arena contest 65-S9.

Georgetown veterans Alonzo
Mourning and Joey Brown sank
18 of 21 free throws to lift the
patient Hoyas to their 10th win
against four losses and put their
Big East mark at 3-2. Pitt fell to 11-
7, 3-3 in league play.

The Panthers nipped at the
Hoyas’ feet all evening but never
took the lead in the game.
Georgetown led by three at
halftime, and that margin seemed
to last the rest of the way.

Down by four with 3:27
remaining, the Panthers drew a
charge from Brown and then
used baskets by Darren
Morningstar and Sean Miller to
bring Pitt within one point with
1:43 left to go. But Brown hit two
free throws and Miller missed
one of his two at the other end,
forcing Pitt to foul again.
Mourning and Brown each
canned two to push the lead to
62-56. Orlando Antigua nailed a
three-pointer with seven seconds
left to trim the margin in half, but
Mourning sealed the game by
making one of two shots from the
charity stripe.

Mourning, the six-foot, ten—inch
senior, finished with 19 points,
15 rebounds and seven blocked
shots. -

After resting for eight minutes
in the first half, Mourning played
the entire second half. The effect
on Pitt’s shooting was staggering.
The Panthers converted 13 of 28
shots from the floor before
intermission, but just 8 of 24

Pitt swimmerjanine Atiyeh has
spent some 14 years dedicated to
her sport. From being an All-
American at Emmaus High School
in Macungie, Pa., to being team
captain in a major college swim
program, Atiyeh has continually
displayed a strong desire to
achieve in both her studies and
swimming. When asked about
her conviction and work ethic,
women’s swimming head coach
David Belowich could only rave
about the senior backstroke
specialist.

With this in mind, how did
Atiyeh make swimming a passion
of her life? Watching the
Olympics? No. A vision from the
‘swim god? Nope.

How about a poor Cathy Rigby
impersonation?

As an eight-year-old in the midst
of her typical busy schedule,
which included gymnastics at 3

center swats away Panthers’ chance to break slide

afterwards.

“They put pretty good pressure
on our outside people,” Pitt head
coach Paul Evans said. “Neither
team shot very well.”

Using a multiple substitution
pattern in the first half,
Georgetown managed to slow

the game down and make every

trip upcourt an adventure. In the
second half, the Hoyas
consistently ran down the shot
clock to single digits before
shooting.

"‘It was like a chess game,”
Mourning said. “If your opponent
takes one move away, you go to
the next step. We were able to do
that tonight.”

True to form for Pitt-
Georgetown games, it was ugly
at times, mostly on offense.
Georgetown shot just 36 percent
from the field, while the Panthers
managed 40 percent. The fouls
were numerous but even, as the
Hoyas committed 24 and Pitt 25.
But the Hoyas -dominated the
boards, grabbing 46 to Pitt’s 30,
including a whopping 17 on the
offensive glass.

“The rebounding was pathetic,”
Evans said. “We just can’t get
outrebounded like that.”

Still, the Panthers were in a
position to win if they would
have connected from the foul
line.

Even Miller missed two of five
attempts. The other lines were
worse: Morningstar made one of
four, Eric Mobley made three of
seven.

“Foul shooting is a big factor in
a lot of games,” Mourning said,
“especially in Big East games.”

Morningstar led the Panthers
with 13 points and eight rebounds,
while Miller scored 10 and nine
assists. Antigua added 10 in his
first Big East start, and he hit five
of six free throws.

p.m., swimming from 6 p.m. to 8
p.m. and ballet from 8pm. to 9
p.m., Atiyeh attempted what one
could call a less than perfect
handspring. "I was doing a back
handspring and my wrist
snapped,” Atiyeh said. “I think I
just decided on swimming due to
my injury.”

While she never got the
opportunity to capture the hearts
of America as an Olympic

gymnast, the gymnastic
community’s loss is Pitt
swimming’s gain and then

some.

Considered to be one of the
most consistent backstroke
specialists in school history,
Atiyeh will lead a depleted but
gutsy Panther squad against Big
East rival Villanova this Saturday
atTrees Pool. A fixture in the 100-
and 200~yard backstroke, the
psychology major is encouraged
by her steadily improving dual
meet times. “My freshman year
was my fastest year,” Atiyeh said.

1.

Jason Hillman/T he Pitt News

Alonzo Mourning grabbed this and 14 other rebounds despite the M&M boy's efforts to stop him last night.

Swz'mmerAt2'yeb dives head first into leadership role

“But right now, I’m doing the
best times, dual meet—wise, that
I've ever done. I’m really happy
with how I’m doing.”

“Once the ‘big’ shave and taper
comes, I expect a big drop in my
times,” Atiyeh said. To the
question of when she’ll beat her
a1l—time best, she quipped, “Give
me some time.” V

Equally happy with Atiyeh’s
progress is Belowich, who values

V her efforts both in and out of the

pool. “I really think very highly of
Janine,” Belowich said. “She
works really, really hard. And as
a leader of the team, people can
depend on her to give good
advice, either in the pool or out.”
Those sentiments are echoed
by first-year swimmer Keri
Killinger, who was impressed with
how Atiyeh and the other captains
acclimated incoming swimmers
to Pitt. “They sat down and made
sure we were adjusted and
comfortable," Killinger said. She
added that Atiyeh’s upbeat nature

sets an example for all teammates
to follow. “She works hard, and
really cheers everyone on.”

For Atiyeh the final year of her
Pitt swimming career has gone as
expected. “I think it’s been what
we’ve anticipated," Atiyeh said,
adding that the intensity of Big
East competition has reached an
all—time high. “We never had any
Big East rivals before. But this
year, Syracuse and Villanova
really came after us.”

Along with Villanova and
Syracuse, the addition of the
University of Miami to conference
play should make this season’s
league meet one of the best yet.
For Pitt to keep their undefeated
meet record intact the Panthers
will need contributions from the
entire team, according to Atiyeh.
“It’s gonna be a bigger challenge
this year,” Atiyeh said. “It was
different in my freshman and
sophomore [years], when we had
a big team. There wasn't as much
pressure on individuals, and not

everyone went to Big Easts. With ‘

the small squad we have this
year, everyone’s gonna go to Big
Easts.” '
Atiyeh’s presence as captain
and team leader has never been
more valuable than now. With
the loss of three seniors, Pitt's

senior class of swimmers has been '

whittled down to four. Atiyeh
said the team learned to handle
the adversity, turning a negative
into a positive. F, '

“It does create a little rift, but
we just went right ovez§,3it,” Atiyeh
said. “You just havﬁg to keep
going.” ‘ 
Keeping her “going'~ uringthe

Netballis a playground game
in St. Kitts, the West Indies home
Of Carol Morton. It is a hybrid
version of basketball with seven
. players on a side, only two Of
whom are allowed to shoot. It is
a game that features a lot of
' A passing.

This is where Morton, now the
starting point guard on the Pitt
women’s basketball team, got her
start.

Morton is a five-foot, three-
inch, first-year student who never
played organized basketball
before this year since there are
no leagues in St. Kitts.

She went from netball, a game
she says she really didn't like
very much, to playing pickup
basketball.

“I tried to play basketball with
‘the guys," Morton said. “They
didn't let me play because I wasn’t
good enough. I wasn’t strong
enough when they pushed. I
worked on my Own, two Or three
in the afternoon when the sun
was very hot so the courts were
empty. After a while, I got to the
point where I could do things so
that I was good enough to play.”

She became good enough to
catch the eye Of Larry Vignella, a
Uniontown, Pa., native who
worked for the Peace Corps in St.
Kitts.

“lvignellal called me and
wanted to know if I could help

  

 

this girl get into school, if I thought
she was good enough to get in,"
Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce said.
“I said, ‘We’ll just do it the way
we normally do it, you send me
a tape.’ If there's someone that far
away that we can't see them live,
they send us a tape. He sent us
the tape, and we just thought that
there was a lot of potential there.
We called him back and said, ‘We
like her, do you think you can get
her here?’ He took care Of the
rest."

Morton tells how Vignella sent
tapes of her playing to Old
Dominion University, Howard
University, Boston College and
Pitt, all after the recruiting period.
Bruce was the only one to
respond.

“He told me to apply, and it
took ten months to get in,” Morton
said. "Coach Bruce told me there
was no funding left for
scholarships so I should come in
now and I would get one in time,
when it became available. I just
wanted to get into school, so I
didn't contact anyone else.”

MOItOn’s exposure to organized
basketball was watching games
On television and visiting Pitt to
watch games and practices during
December 1990.

“lt was very different,” Morton
said. “We only play zone [defense]
back home, and the game isn’t as
constricted. I newl had the athletic
ability to play [Division I
basketball], but the little things,
the way they dribble the ball,

Especially the shooting, because
I can’t shoot the ball. I just don’t
have the confidence.

“When I was finally doing it,
setting screens, rolling Off screens,
things were very foreign,” Morton
added. “It’s cOming.”

Bruce seems to agree, since"

Morton moved into the starting
lineup for the Jan. 3 game at
Providence and stayed in it for
six games since.

“I think she’s done fine,
considering she’s never played
organized basketball, let alone
Division I college ball,” Bruce
said.

“This is her first experience
with competitive basketball.
There's no leagues at all where
she lived, she just played pickup.
As far as a clock and a referee 
, it just doesn’t exist where she’s
from. We had to teach her all
that.”

Morton doesn’t seem to worry
about those things. She is very
calm on the court, sometimes too
calm.

Morton knew nobody in the
area except Vignella. She said
she had been to the United States
before but had never lived away
from home this long.

“I was aware [Of how things are

get a little down, then the team,

Predictionsfor ’92 include Star cameo, Bonilla-Bonds swap

By Bennett Zamoff
For The Pitt News

Editor's Note.- W.'P7S~FM (98.5)
is the campus radio station. Aside
from musical programming, ‘PTS
has a daily sports show which airs
Monday-Friday from 4: 30- 5p. m.
The staffis made up ofa variety of
students who not only bless the
airwaves with theiryouthful ﬂair,
but will also he authoring a weelely
column in The Pitt News.

Ah! Can you feel the biting cold
of an arctic January wind smack
against your cringing face? Are
the books you waited two and a
half hours in line to purchase, but
still just haven’t found the time to
open yet, forming a nice attractive
stack in your room?

We’re now well into the new
year. 1992 is three weeks old and
with this new year comes a variety
of things 4- among them
resolutions, tender hugs by the
fireplace (or radiator, or air vent,
depending upon your living
situation) with that special
someone, and of course, those
wonderful ‘predictions! And for
those of us who help to cover the
endless majesty of sports, sports
predictions!

Now, I know what you’re

- saying. Why wait three weeks

into thenyear to offer your
whimsical sports predictions for

1992? Well, I was busy. And I was
lazy. But the real reason is the
one that every sports fan is sure
to realize. For if they do not, then
they cannot be a true sports fan.
I was waiting for Sunday, Jan. 26,
to roll around.

What is this Sunday, you ask?
Yes, it is the Super Bowl. But it is
also something more. Something
infinitely more special. This
Sunday is the birthday of one of
my heroes, the great Bob Uecker.

And it’s the day that sports
prognosticators like myself will
dig deep into the corners of their
clairvoyant minds, stare long and
hard into their crystal balls and
honor this great man by telling
the world all that will happen in
the months that lay ahead.

So now, without further ado,
and in the spirit of “the Ueke,”
here are my fabulous sports
predictions for the Bob Uecker
New Year. -

Tom Tumulty of the Panthers
will follow the leads of Sean
Gilbert and Keith Hamilton by
becoming the first Pitt player ever
to forgo his sophomore, junior
and senior seasons to enter the
NFL draft.

Jim Kelly will announce his
retirement from the Bills and
become the national spokesman
for Rogaine Hair Products.

Sid Fernandez will announce
his retirement from the Mets and

become japan’s most celebrated
sumo wrestler.

Eric Mobley will send the city
of Pittsburgh into a frenzy, when
he sinks two free throws in a row
in the waning seconds of the
championship game to give Pitt
the national title.

The Pirates will thoroughly tick
off Bobby Bonilla by getting him
back from the Mets in exchange
for Barry Bonds.

Americans everywhere will
flock to their local theaters to see
the first motion picture ever made
about the UNLV Runnin’ Rebels,
with Elmer Fudd as Jerry
Tarkanian.

Sylvester Stallone will decide
to go ahead and make just one
more Rocky film, with former
Vikings head coach Jerry Burns
as the ghost of Mickey.

Darren Morningstar will
become America’s newest teen
heart throb when he makes a
cameo appearance on “Beverly
Hills 90210,” as Dylan’s long—lost,
older brother.

Every professional sports team
from every league in North
America will do something really
original, and reel in as much
money from merchandise as they
possibly can by changing their
colors to silver and black.

That Bob Saget guy from
“America’s Funniest Home
Videos” will get fired, and his
program cancelled. (I realize this
has absolutely nothing at all to do
with the world of sports, but I
really can’t stand that guy and his
dumb show.)

Bob Walk will send movie-
goers everywhere howling in
terror with his gripping portrayal
of the monster who just wanted
to play baseball, in “Welcome To
The Majors, Frankenstein!”

’ Yeah, and the Bullets will win
the NBA Championship.

Hey, it could happen. Happy

Birthday, Ueke!

described the march as «.1 great
success, they were disgusted with
Sen. Wofford.

“He ran around in circles and
responded to most of the
questions by saying, “I already
answered that in another form,"
Collins said.

Garrett compared Wofford
unfavorably to pro-choice
Pennsylvania senators Arlen
Specter and the late John Heinz.
Garrett said he interrupted
Wofford’s speech by shouting,
“We gave Specter 12 years; were
not going to give you that long,"
to loud applause.

Pennsylvania Senate contender
and state Rep. Steve Freind
attended the march, along with
Sen. Jesse Helms (R.—N.C.) and
other politicians.

Most people do not understand
how violent abortion is, according
to Garrett. ,

“You ask most students at Pitt
and they just think you’re
removing a piece of tissue,"
Garrett said. “Five to seven weeks
after conception the child is so

well-develoned."
He said he recently saw an

abortion through a sonogram
where the “doctor was tearing
the baby apart limb from limb 
and you could see the baby
screaming in the womb.”

Wade would soon be overturned
and President George Bush has
firmly pledged his support v to
prohibit abortion.

But University Democrats
President Joel Leonard was
confident that the Supreme Court’
wouldn’t threaten a woman’s right
to a legal abortion during an
election year.

“The last thing the Republicans
and George Bush want to do is
run on the issue of abortion when
this country is polled time and
time again as pro-choice,” he
said. “The vocal minority says it’s
murder, and the silent majority
says it’s a constitutional right.”

Leonard said there are glaring
inconsistencies in the pro-life

movement. “If they are truly’

devoted to sanctity of human life,
they wouldn’t use violent tactics
like bombing abortion clinics.”
Pro-life activists are also
insensitive to the needs of
pregnant women, he said.
College Republicans public-
relations director Jonathan
Kurland disagreed because pro-
life support services like Birthright
and Mom's House in Pittsburgh
exist to help unwed mothers.
Garrett objected to the use of
the word “choice" by the pro-
choice movement. “This beautiful
word ‘choice’ covers up what
you're really choosing — the
eating apart of a child,” he said.

From Illt

By Brian Berger
and Rob Pugliese
The Pitt News

Coming straight outta Illtown,
East Orange, N. ].’s Naughty By
Nature invades Pittsburgh for a
rare rap show in this town. Of
course, NBN is known for their
platinum-selling summer anthem
“O.P.P.” which has culminated in
masses of bootlegged t-shirts and
hats. But their Tommy Boy debut
album is much more than a
Jackson S hook-and-catch phrase.
A member of _Iersey’s Flavor Unit,
Naughty By Nature is following
the footsteps of Lakim Shabazz,
Chill Rob G, Apache, DJ Mark the
45 King and Latifah. The band
has put Newjersey as well as East
Coast hardcore back on the rap
map, proving the New York area
can still blow up anywhere, even
in California.

Consisting of T reach, Vini Rock
and Kaygee, NBN’s self-produced
debut is a slammin’ up—tempo
romp over funky, live drum tracks
and bass lines with keyboards
and piano loops dropped by Dave

’ Bellochio.

Treach comes off like a wild
roughneck with a fierce, furious
rhyme style while Kaygee and
Vini use the live studio
instruments over subtle scratches
and samples, producing a
refreshing blend. Lyrically T reach
hits hard and drops many crazy
stoopid lines all over the wax like
“My pants always sag cause I rap
my ass off,” and “I left so many
lumps I’ll leave your head as a
braille book” and “that's about as
fun as Barbara Bush in a bobsled.”
It’s hard to keep up with him.

Before NBN there was The
New Style, which released a
sparse LP on Sugarhill subsidiary
Bon Ami Records, but nobody
got paid and nobody heard the
record. Thanks to the summer’s
catchiest loop, dope lyrics, sing-
along chorus, new catch phrase,_
and mad radio, jeep, MTV and
club play, NBN is finally getting
the bank it deserves. While
“O.P.P” is still lingering and the

new single “Everything’s Gonna
Be Alright” (courtesy. of a Bob‘
Marley sample, although the song
on the album is called “Ghetto

rest of the wax is real phat. The
piano-laden cuts of “Guard Your
Grill” and “Rhyme’ll Shine On”
ﬂow, while harder tracks like
“1,2,3” and “Strike A Nerve” slap
the rough beats, making a
combination that appeals to all
funk fans, from the sappy to the
undecided to those in the know.

boots and hardcore poses, NBN

Cannibal Corpse spells
pure gore and mayhem

By Jennifer Profﬂtt
For T be Pitt News

“Carnage is my fetish/body cavities scraped of guts. Brains’
seeping from cracks as/my axe continues to hack."

This tasteful scene is described by five fun guys from Buffalo,
N.Y. Cannibal Corpse, consisting of vocalist Chris Barnes, guitarists
Bob Rusay and Jack Owen, bassist Alex Webster and drummer
Paul Mazurkiewicz, spells pure blood, guts and gore—grindcore at
its finest-.

The album cover of their latest effort, Butchered at Birth, an
honorable follow—up to Eaten Bacle To Life, both on the Metal .
Blade Records label, was surrounded by a lot of controversy.
Rusay wanted to explain the cover for those who have not been
able to feast their eyes on it as of yet.

“It’s got a lot of blood, a lot of babies hanging from meathooks
and it’s gore. I mean, there’s zombies involved and it's rude,” the
guitarist said. _

The cover was banned in England and in the States, so to see
the real thing one must send away for a copy of the lyric sheet
and cover art. Originally, according to Rusay, the cover was to be
wrapped in butcher paper, but the plain white cover with the red
Cannibal Corpse logo won in the end.

Superchunk
No Pocley For Kitty

Through the special powers of
telekinesis, the merits of a fine-tuned
engine can be transported to another
medium. Concentration, transplantation
and mechanicsgnow equal Superchunk.

Pay close attention ‘cuz it seems that the
buzzword of today and the commodity of
tomorrow is this North Carolina quartet.
Between the recent press (including a
glistening review in the mass-audienced
Spin) and their soundtracking a British
Knights spot, the members of Superchunk
are 1992’s undercurrent darlings. Rumors
that big time labels are scouting the band
have not panned out and, as it stands
today, Superchunk is still hangin’ to the
indie rope.

The band’s second LP on Matador
records, No Pocley for Kitty, contains 12

and bass. “Press” and “Throwing Things,”
two faster cuts, speed along with lengthy
guitar spats and near-exhausting thumps.
By far the most rambunctious cut on the
platter is “Tower” — Superchunk at its
lubricated best. With lyrics like, “I have
my days for sure but I don’t count them/
When everything’s just right I’ll come

Local band brings (North Neville) blues to thecity

By Larry Chough

Staff Writer

A fresh, new sound has taken
Pittsburgh by surprise. The thing
is this new sound comes from old
roots: the blues. Although
Pittsburgh offers many
opportunities to hear many
different styles of music and
although the blues is one of those
styles, the city never seems to
earn much notoriety for being a
place to hear some good blues.
Well, the North Neville Blues
Band hopes to change that —— or
at least have a lot of fun trying.

Noteven six months old, the
North Neville Blues Band has
gained the kind of reputation and
following that takes some bands
six years to achieve.

Often a top draw at such venues
like the Decade, Thirsty’s, Graffiti
and the Artery, the members of
this band have achieved this status
by doing what comes easy to
them: having fun playing the
blues.

All players in the band are
either students or graduates of
the University of Pittsburgh.
Harmonica player/singer, Marc
Simoncelli, 25, graduated from
Pitt in 1991. He, like all of the
players in the band, says he loves
to play the blues and he couldn’t
find a better band to play the
blues with than the North Neville
Blues Band.

“Our band is a great band —

the only band I'd ever want to be
in,” he said.

Simoncelli’s main influences
come from James Cotton and
Little Walter, both harmonica
players of Muddy Waters fame.

It was through casual jam
sessions with Simoncelli and
guitar player Terry McKain that
the North Neville Blues Band
began to take form.

McKain, 21, whose main
inﬂuence is the sliding acoustic
style of Robertjohnson, says that
aside from putting a band
together, it was the passion for
the blues that was just as
important.

Eventually, they began
recruiting other players to fill the
necessary spots for a solid blues
band. In doing so, they picked
up Dave Dutwin, 22, on guitar;
Stephen Grada, 24, on bass guitar
and Larry Arrigo, 23, on drums.

The North Neville Blues Band
was only one ‘month old when it
got its first show, opening for
another popular local band,
Blackfish, at the Artery in
Shadyside.

“We knew about eight songs,”
Simoncelli recalled, “and just
auditioned our singer Rich Bindell
the night before. B1ackfish’s
opening band cancelled at the
last minute, so they called us. In
turn, we called Rich and asked
him if he would want to sing a
few songs at the show. It went
really well, and the Artery booked

us as a headlining band soon
after.”

The day of the Artery show
also served as the day the North
Neville Blues Band would
officially get its name.

“Just as a joke, we called
ourselves the North Neville
Instrumental Blues Band, so when
we were put on the spot, we
decided to go with the name,"
Simoncelli said.

Although the players come from
different musical backgrounds,
their common interest in the blues
is what makes the band work.

Drummer Larry Arrigo, who
has played in the Pitt drumline
for four years and served as
section leader his senior year,
said, “If I could do this-for the rest
of my life, it’s all I'd want to do.”

Arrigo also has significant
experience in jazz performance
— the most notable is his winning
the Most Outstandingjazz Soloist
in a Florida Jazz Competition.
He, along with McKain, also
instructs the Moon Township

 

High School drumline.

“Blues is so down to earth,”
Arrigo said. "You can get in touch
with the feeling.”

Success on the local level,
however, does not distort the
band’s dedication to the blues.
Although almost any band would
enjoy mainstream success (some
strive for it), the North Neville
Blues Band isn’t setting its goals
as high. Simoncelli, along with
other band members, stresses the
importance of having fun while
playing.

“You never know. We'd like to
conquer Pittsburgh in a sense,
but when it comes down to it, it’s
all for fun.”

Guitarist Dave Dutwin, who
has played in various jazz bands
in the past, including the
McDonald’s American High
School-Jazz Band and the New
England All-Starjazz Band, offers
a more realistic attitude to the
potential mainstream success of
the band.

“I’ve been in too many bands,

and because of that I’ve had too
many reality checks — too many
disappointments — to have high
expectations,” Dutwin said.

McKain also recalls his past
experiences in bands as
inﬂuencing his present attitude
toward hopes of mainstream
success.

“I really don’t care about being
famous,” he said. “What does it
really get you? I’ve been in bands
before where they want to get on
MTV. It just doesn’t happen.”

Bassist Stephen Grada prefers
to take a casual approach to the
band in general — to the point
where, “I think at times it drives
them crazy.

“If we got millions of dollars, I
wouldn’t complain, but I’m
deﬁnitely in it for the fun," Grada
said.

Simoncelli sums up the band’s
attitude by saying, “We want to
keep having fun and keep
entertaining people, and we’ll
take it as far as we can go.”

All throbfilled Tuesday with Chicago’s Tar and The Vivians

By Mike Sula
_ Staﬁ' Writer

God told me not to write about
Tar. I’m gonna be sorry. I have
walked through the valley of the
shadow of  uh  Chances are
yunz will be reading about the

I ‘ latestOliverStone jerk-off instead

of this anyway. Once upon a time
this Chicago filmmaker, who
doubles as an urban anthro-
pologist studying indi-genous
Pittsburgh cave dwellers, came
over with a coupla’ mouth-
breathers who said, “Yinz got a
nice place here.

Yinz like t’ porty?” So this
ﬁlmmaker likes to shoot whirling,
spinning manhole covers
superimposed over short-haired,
Chi-Town rock ‘n’ steamrollers
like the boys in Tar.

Tar stands for Tough and
Rumble. Or is that Rough and
Tumble? Tusk and Bubble? Muff
and Stubble? It’s all of those. Tar

Lock~Me-Tight like any other
AmRep band.

Tighter than the God Bullies, I

smarter than Helmet, Tar is the
Ubermensch, the highest order
of a long evolution of noise-cum-
punk Chicago units including Big
Black and Naked Raygun. It is all
tight, structured and loud like the
rumblings of Jim Belushi’s lower
intestine after deep dish. It is
Tar’s third record release the band
will be supporting on this tour. It
is called jacleson after the
blaxploitation film Action
Jackson of a few years back which
starred Carl Weathers in his finest

role. It is dense, pregnant guitar
wonk, murdering silence with
layers of thick, bulldozed riffs
and drill-press rhythms. Hear it
or wear it. ’

That is, Tar comes to you by
way of Greg Panchisin, M.B.
Bookings reincarnated in the form
of Slacker Productions, the
spreading, rolling juggernaut of
hip trip. Obey or this band will
crush you.

What else has the cat dragged

in? How about the epitome of

rock ‘n’ roll in these thrashy days,
and from right next door.

and the Flats and The Vivians, a
three-girl, one-guy assaultvehicle
doing more damage than Hussein
and his zombies wreaked upon
Kuwait (not to mention their own
folk).

Duncan’s psychologically
inflicting lyrics, the wails of
Temple’s sonic geetar, Martello’s
throb-ﬁlled bass and Benedict’s
relentless kick and power-punch
skins all meld as The Vivians, It’s
been said before, but if Heart
knew how to rock the result
might sound something like the
Vivs’ roll.

Mice, birds and everything else
the great outdoors has to offer
the lonely feline, she brings
Pittsburgh’s newest freaks saliva,
blood and guts;

Swab will headline this trifecta
that is sure to offer a large payout.
MC Lingo wishes he was born a
Dane so he could have played

, with The Ex (or even the Dog

Faces Hermans). But instead, his
Meadville-bred behind conjures
up images of far away places
where dissonant noise is king.
We’re all rooting for it to happen
here as well, Swab.

One chemical sunrise I woke
to find the drummer from the

self-promoting folk singer named
after a ﬂowering gastropod.
(“C’mon, what’s yer real name?”)
It is still unknown whether the
stars were shining on Charlie
Ondras (the aforementioned skins

he was cursing some cosmic twist

then goes after Q as the two
battle on top of an apartment
building roof in the film's finale.
The ending becomes corny as
Bishop falls over the ledge only
to be grabbed by Q, but Bishop’s
grip starts to slip and, well  see
for yourself. Regardless, the scene
is hardly original as two friends
part ways because of views only
to ‘be reunited in a lifesaving
situation at the film’s climax.
Hollywood’s corporate vultures
have preyed on that decay
countless times before.
Dickerson has been around
enough fine productions to know
better. He’s been Spike Lee’s
cinematographer of choice for all
of Lee’s films, including the
upcoming Malcolm X. In
addition, Dickerson has worked
with john Sayles on Me Brother
From Another Planet and Robert

like a who's who of the rap
community. Treach, Kid Capri,‘
EPMD, Special Ed, Queen Latifah, ’
DJ Richie Rich and others show
their mugs, adding to the film's
street flavor which essentially
keeps it going. I

It’s easy to relate to the daily
struggles of the characters’ lives,
making the actors’ adventures
refreshing. Unfortunately the
characters suffer because of the
mediocre script. Dickerson seems
more concerned with making his
point than with allowing the
viewer a chance to grasp the
characters.

For most Hollywood
productions I would say this is
great, but in this case I was anxious
to see the characters hangin’ out
more. A

When they do hang it often
becomes serious, turning into an
ideological struggle instead of

Dickerson’s résumé reads like a

the point, putting the characters’

The band attributes its success to Blackﬁsh for giving the
group its start and to the loyal fans who come out consistently
to support the North Neville Blues Band.

Singer Rich Bindell, 21, a member of the Pi Lambda Phi
fraternity at Pitt, said, “We just want to show our appreciation
to all the people coming to the shows.” _

Arrigo noted, “The support has been fantastic, and we really
owe a lot to the people who come out to hear us.”

The North Neville Blues Band is bringing the blues to
Pittsburgh, and it's having a lot of fun in the process.

Ah, but then came Christmas
with gold, frankincense and a
roommate bearing the first full-
length Unsane LP on Matador
(home of Superchunk and other
indie heroes).

Recorded one year ago today
(the odd coincidences in this tale
are too numerous not to warrant
mention in some Time/Life
series), it's the big bloody entree
to follow the two previous
appetizers.

Thick, controlled swipes of
atomic wind-tunnel guitar and
bass chug around in so many
effects to produce tonal white
noise, like KDKA after Love
Connection and broncho—
dilators.

And then there’s the lime-in-

Lover Boy himself beating on

As for the content, the album is
dedicated to Albert Fish, “The
cannibal who was dismembering
little children and all sorts of rude
things. The zombie‘ cutting into
the carcass on the table represents
him,” Rusay said.

“We are more or less going in
that direction because we are

going for the guts. We're going ..

for the gore. We're going for the
real thing,”Rusay said. Does Bob
support serial killers? “Yeah! Go

» out and butcher your family!,” he

yelled, joking of course.

“No, serial killers have a
problem which they take out on
society. They need help, like that
dude in Milwaukee, Jeffrey
Dahmer.

Now there is a classic example,
I mean, they found people in his
meatlocker. That’s the stuff we
are looking for. It’s the real stuff
that is really out there,” Rusay
said. _
