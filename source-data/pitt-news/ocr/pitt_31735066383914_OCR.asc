Pitt football coach Jackie Sherrill
said at the beginning of the season
that if Pitt lost quarterback Matt
Cavanaugh it would beome a very
ordinary team. He was right.

Cavanaugh had the Panther
offense moving almost at will in
yesterday’s opener against Notre
Dame when injury struck, and not
even Pitt’s brilliant defense could

pdeny the‘Fighting Irish a 19-9

comeback victory before a sellout
crowd of 56,500 at Pitt Stadium and
a national television audience.

Pitt’s chances for upsetting the
number one ranked Irish were
shattered in the ﬁrst quarter when
Notre Dame’s defensive end Willie
Fry hit Cavanaugh on the Panthers’
ﬁrst touchdown play of the year. As
a result, Cavanaugh fell on his hand
and walked off the ﬁeld With 3
broken left wrist, which will sideline
the Heisman Trophy candidate for
possibly six weeks.

“I said’ at the beginning of the
season that we couldn’t afford to
lose a couple of players—and Matt
was one of them,” Sherrill said.
“We thought things were starting
to jell for us before he got hurt. A
Things were starting to fall into
place-and then everything was out
the window.”

The anticipation of Cavanaugh’s
condition was evident; complete
silence fell over the wall-to-wall
crowd when the public address
announcer confirmed what every-
body hoped wasn’t true-
Cavanaugh was indeed lost to the
team. . The disheartening news took
the spirit out of the Pitt supporters
for only a moment, though.

Seconds later, they sprang to life in
hopes of instilling a new confidence
into the team and backup quarter-
back Wayne Adams.

What the Panthers needed,
however, was more than a standing
ovation. They needed an offense

that could hold on to the ball.

By DAN ROSENTHAL
Pitt News Staffwriter ‘

A Pitt electrician is in satisfactory
condition at West Penn Hospital
following an electrical explosion
which injured two men at Langley
Hall Aug. 25, the Pitt News has
learned.

The explosion occurred during a

gley-Crawford complex while
power was being transferred to a

_j M eduled outage in the Clapp-
 it

transformer in Crawford Hall.

Switches were being thrown in
the basement of Langley when one
malfunctioned, .. throwing out ‘ ‘an
arc of electricity like a momentary
ﬂash of fire, ” according to Richard
Barnhart, Pitt’s director of health
and safety.

There was no connection between
last month’s accident and the Jan.

ing 23 percent of his body.

Glenn Schott, 32, a Pitt electrical
engineer, was treated at Presbyter-
ian University Hospital for burns on

released. ’ i I

The cause of the accident is still
undetermined and power is being
rerouted around the faulty switch
until a new one arrives and the old
switch can be removed and
examined. _

Scattered blackouts were report-
ed from the electrical substation in
the new Forbes Complex to the
Library and Information Sciences
building on Belleﬁeld Avenue,
according to Barnhart.

Most power was restored by 1
A.M. Aug. 27 but “a rented
emergency generator and dry ice
were brought into the (Clapp-Lang-

preserve experimental projects,”
Barnhart said.

Some materials, however, were
destroyed because of the accident.

“Some people lost drugs and
chemicals due to lack of refrigera-
tion,” said Anthony Caggiula,
associate psychology professor.

“And many of the experimental
animals may have been" affected,”
Caggiula added.

Temperatures in animal rooms

variety of stress effects on rats,
according to Caggiula.

“The lack of air conditioning for
any amount of time can be a stress
factor,” Caggiula said. “He
(Zigmond) may have lost his whole
control group.” A

Zigmond was unavailable for
comment, but according to his
secretary, had been working on the
stress project for about a month.

Charlie Saller, a life sciences
graduate student, said that as a
result of the power outage, “many
drug standards and radiation
samples are being questioned.”

Some tissue samples are kept at
temperatures of -70 and -20
degrees, according to Saller.

“Most of the -70 degree samples
were all right, but some frozen
blood samples thawed and other
samples were at room temperature
by the time the power was
restored, ’ ’ Saller said.

A sign posted in Crawford Hall
lists persons to contact “in case of
power failure or other emergency. ’ ’
The list includes Zigmond and
Saller. A

“That sign went up after the
power outage,” Saller said.

Student Reps j
.Plan Lobby

By PATTY TASCARELLA
and MARK MURPHY

Pitt News Staff Writers

Representatives from Pitt’s and
Penn State’s student governments
met this weekend in a series of
meetings to ﬁnalize plans for a joint

response to the budget crisis caused.

by deferred appropriations for
non-preferred categories in the
state budget.

Student government officials
from Temple University and Lincoln
University, the state’s other
state-related institutions, failed to
attend the meeetings, reportedly
due to internal squabblings.

Student Government Board
(SGB) members Chip Hubbard,
Dave Hesidence and Gary Tweed
made up the Pitt contingent.
Undergraduate Student Govern-
ment (USG) President Grant
Ackerman led the Penn State group
which also included Denny Rupert
vice president of USG, Bill
McCullough, staff member of the
student liason, Tony Gaertner of the
USG Senate, Matt Hanna, chairman
of the Senate Government Relations
Committee, Mark Robbins, director
of the Department of Common-
wealth Campuses and Mike
Stinson, the USG state government
liason.

Student efforts will be 00-
ordinated on the basis of geograph-
ical districts, and possibly senator-
ial districts. Pitt will take the
western portion of the state, Penn
State the central, and Temple and
Lincoln the eastern.

Student Reps Prepare
For Harrisburg Fight

(Continued from Page, 1)

A Hesidence and Hubbard have
already begun the Pitt ﬁght by
organizing the ad-hoc Student Task
Force for Higher Education,
consisting of a core of 16-20

‘ students.

“These people will be respon-
sible for orginizing students on
several levels, trying to give them
directions on writing to legis-
lators,” Hesidence said. “We
don’t want abuse and we want
letters written to the right
legislators.

“These committees also will be
getting students to meet with their
individual legislators in their home
ofﬁces or Harrisburg,” Hesidence
added.

Both schools expressed the desire
for a “highly organized, highly
controlled, well-written letter
writing campaign. To achieve this
goal, Ackerman proposed a system
whereby the students learn how
their legislators plan to vote on the
tax increase ( yes to taxes or no to
taxes). After this information is
obtained, a committee member will
instruct the student in the
composition of the proper letter,
based on the leanings of their
legislator.

Ackerman also emphasized the
importance of personal phone calls
to legislators from both students
and parents, citing the need for
each constituent to have the proper
information as a prerequisite of
such a campaign.

Also planned is a major public
relations campaign using buttons
and flyers and an as yet
undetermined slogan, one that can
last as long as the. appropriation
ﬁght continues, possibly several
years.

“We don’t want to sell ourselves
short, but we must have a slogan
that will last for years,” Stinson

said. “This ﬁght will be a year to
year thing and we need something
that people won’t forget.”

Both schools assured the other
that their respectives adminis-
trations are securely behind them
and will be of some help.‘

“The administration (Pitt’s) is
solidly behind us, ’ ’ Hesidence said.
“They’ve been very supportive,
extremely so, in every level. As far
as economic matters go, Pitt has not
had to borrow yet. It’s a tribute to
Dr. Posvar and the Board of

' Trustees that Pitt has a strong

enough cash flow that it won’t have
to borrow until October.

“But once we have to borrow
troubles arise,” Hesidence con-
tinued. “If the legislature dallies
around with us too long, something
drastic will happen by January. The
last thing the University would do is
shut down all together.”

The major obstacle to .Pitt’s
appropriations is the attitudes of the
taxpayers and their reluctance to
make up the budget deﬁcit in higher
taxes.

“Certain legislatures are trying
to hold Pitt hostage,” Hesidence
said. “It’s to the point now where
people will begin believing that Pitt
is responsible for the tax increase.
We have to shift the burden back to
certain legislators. It’s their
responsibility to devise a method of
coming up with the needed money
without shutting Pitt down.”

If the state-related universities
are to receive the needed funds, the
votes of two-thirds of the state
legislators are required.

“The Senate doesn’t seem to be
much of a problem,” Hesidence
said. The trouble is the House; an
equal number is for and against us.
We’ve been given data that points
out it’s an uphill battle.”

The Student Government Al-
locations Committee is now auth-
orized to make ﬁnal decisions
regarding budget modiﬁcations.

The Allocations Committee
member, serving as a liason
between Allocations and all other
committees. will be empowered to
make emergency date, time and
facility changes. ‘providing the
designated program remains the

'. same.

Previously. all budget changes
were submitted to Allocations for
review. then forwarded to the
S udent Government (SGB) for
at lroval. All actions taken by the
crmmittee must be reported to
,‘.3B. -

Other amendments regarding
1977-78 policies and procedures for
allocating funds to student organi-

zations were drafted at last week's
meeting.

The starting date of the one-year
term of office for Allocations
Committee members has been
changed from Jan. 15 to Oct. 15.

The date change will give the
new Allocations Committee time to
become acquainted with the
policies and procedures for allocat-
ing Student Government funds,
according to SGB member Gary
Tweed. ’

“In the past students were just
thrown into ofﬁce not knowing
what they were doing," Tweed
said. “This date will give the
Allocations Committee an extra
two—and-a-half months to learn how
to handle budget modiﬁcation and
procedures.” '

Other changes were made in the
allocation of student activities fees.

 A|loca’rionpGuide|ines Revised

No political candidate .can be
backed or campaign contributions
made with money accrued from
activities fees. The fees also may
not be used to subsidize materials
espousing specific political or
religious ideologies. However,
money will be allotted to those
political or religious programs
providing an open forum, with
opportunities for expression of‘
opposing viewpoints.

The Board also decided to set
aside $13,000 from the activities
fund for all concerts. The
maximum dollar ﬁgure for honor-
ariums will not be permitted to
exceed $8,000.

All parties, according to Tweed,
will be encouraged to promote
smaller. less expensive shows. The
board indicated their goal is to
program concerts that break even
between ticket revenue and gross
expenditures’ whenever possible.

ECONOIVY OUTLOOK DULL

WASHINGTON (AP)——The
world economy is characterized by
high unemployment and serious
inflation in many countries and
there is little likelihood of any rapid
improvement, the International
Monetary Fund said yesterday. _

The fund said it will require
“skill.’patience and courage” on
the part of many governments to
keep the situation from getting
worse.

It attributed the failure to reduce
unemployment “mainly to the
moderate pace of output growth,
which has barely offset” the
normal growth in the labor force in
most countries.

De-Programming
Concerts

It has long been a fact of Oakland life that Pitt students do not
enjoy many benefits usually associated with campus living.
Recreational facilities are few and poor. A student discount in
Oakland is rare, the student buying card notwithstanding. And for
years, Pitt students have not received even adequate campus
entertainment, especially in the area of music and despite the fact

' they have been paying for it.

This makes student government’s recent move to stifle the dying
programming committee and offer Pitt students discount tickets to
professionally produced concerts featuring big-name acts a
welcome one.

Large amounts of student activity fee monies are spent on
programming. .This year’s student government budget set aside
more than $100,000 for concernts and lectures. But in recent years,
at least, such expenditures constituted money down the drain.
Programming used large sums of money (some $80,000 last year) to
finance ill-planned programs that drew barely enough students to
man a pre—8 a.m. registration line.
Dave Mason concert, which cost student government
approximately $40 for each student who attended.

A far better idea is to allow a downtown promoter to handle
arrangements for the concert—with some student input—and
spend student money on discounted tickets instead of on
champagne for the band. In exchange for a guaranteed purchase of
more than a thousand student seats, some promoters have agreed
to allow student government a say in who will play where, and
when. Student government would buy 1,500 or more tickets and
sell them to I.D.-carrying students at a several-dollar discount.

At the projected loss of $4,000 per concert, almost 20 concerts
could be subsidized for the amount of money recently spent on the
likes of Geoff Muldaur, Andy Pratt, Up All Night or the infamous
Star-Spangled Washboard Band. Using the results of a survey,
SGB is considering Chicago, Ronnie Laws and Al J arreau, Kansas
and Hall and Oates for fall term shows. $6.50 tickets would sell for
$3.50 under the SGB plan. It sounds like a good deal.

This is not to say small, inexpensive lower-lounge shows should
be forgotten. A programming committee formed to produce such
concerts could be a worthwhile addition to SGB’s entertainment
division.

Stopping programming’s recent hugh drain of student funds,
however, will be a good step, whether the result is more
entertainment or just less wasted money.

A Correction

An, error made during the composition of last Friday’s
editorial page resulted in the omission of part of the
editorial concerning Paul Nyden’s cash settlement with the
University. The affected paragraph should have read:

If Nyden was competent, and his dismissal the product of
political disagreement, the only fair remedy was the
offering of a contract that would have allowed Nyden a
fair chance of receiving tenure. And if he was not capable
of teaching at Pitt, he should have been fired, not paid riff.

Tuition increases each year, giving us the impression Pitt
does not have money to throw at each dismissed instructor
who creates controversy.

One notable example is the '

‘Gang of Seven’ Fiddles Around

We are appalled to find that, as
the University opens this fall, the
State Legislature has failed to
appropriate the funds that Pitt
requires in order to function. For
many of us, things will seem to be
“business as usual,” because the
University will borrow money from
the banks to tide us over while the
Legislature ﬁddles. Employees
probably will be paid, and classes
will continue. However, the
University community should not sit
on its hands in this situation. Make
no mistake about it: this crisis is
serious.

The banks will not lend money
without extracting their pound of
ﬂesh in the form of interest
payments. While the Legislature
delays, the interest payments will
mount up. This will ultimately take
its toll through higher tuition, larger
classes, and layoffs of University
personnel. The cost of education
will rise, while its quality will
decrease.

The responsibility for this crisis
rests in several areas. The
Administration’s failure to realize
the need for popular support in the
budget struggle cannot be ignored.
For example, last spring the
Graduate and Professional Student
Association contacted the Adminis-
tration and expressed its desire to

direct a letter-writing campaign to .

the Legislature in support of the Pitt
budget. The Administration
refused to cooperate with this
proposal, reassuring us that Pitt’s
lobbyist, ex-Senator Thomas Lamb,

disagreements with some of the
points in Peter Butch’s September
7th article on the “Star Wars”
soundtrack album.

First, I ﬁnd the whole soundtrack
a delight to listen to. I’m not bored
by all but the titles, battle music and
Cantina Band. Some especially

NEWS reserves the right to

missions no longer than four
paragraphs will be con-
sidered lor earliest
publication.

“The Return Home. ’ ’ I ﬁnd that ifl
read the scene description and John
William's comments, which are
included on a sheet of paper in the
album, I can visualize the context
quite easily. And even that is not
necessary. The soundtrack can be
enjoyed as ﬁne music in itself,
without a context to give it validity.

As for the disco version, I find it
rather distasteful. I suppose it’s not

as bad as it could be, but there is no
comparing it with the London
Symphony. The sound effects
especially urk me. R2-D2 and
C-3PO’s voices seem out of place. I
like the two as ﬁne people, but
singers they’re not.

Finally, Mr. Butch’s assertion
that the disco version is more
popular than the soundtrack is
difﬁcult for me to believe. Did he
read last Sunday’s Press? He might
have noted that the soundtrack
album was number four on the top
ﬁve albums of the week, whereas
the disco piece didn't even place in
the top 10 singles. ‘

had the problem well under control.
Later, during the budget crisis, the
Chancellor did appeal to the
University community to write
letters, but the move was too little
and too late. We now ask, what
sense does‘ it make to pay Lamb
$40,000 per year (part-time) to
accomplish nothing? Administra-
tion ineptitude certainly is respon-
sible in part.

But blame does not stop at the
Chancellor’s ofﬁce. We cannot
ignore the fact that seven legislators
from western Pennsylvania teamed
up with reastinnary Repuhlisans ts
block the state budget for two
months. This ‘gang of seven,’
headed by Thomas Nolan, has no
compassion for the plight of‘ state
employees or for the citizens’ need
for state assistance, ‘be it health,
education or welfare. We also need
to have an explanation from Senator
Heinz, who failed to inﬂuence his
party mates in the Legislature on
this issue. He found western
Pennsylvania votes helpful to his
election victory, yet he deserted us
in our time of need.

Given the presentcritical situa-
tion, does the Legislature really
expect the University community to
sit idly by while Pitt’s funding is
used as a political football, tossed
back and forth -between the

Legislature and Governor Shapp?
Do they assume us to be so‘
politically naive that we ca.ty§j'~
understand when we are being
made scapegoats for a tax increase?
It is time for all members of the
University community to join forces
and state emphatically that this
charade must stop!

Other citizen groups in the
Commonwealth have done this.
Earlier this summer, during the
budget crisis, funding for the
Department of Public Welfare was
about to be drastically cut. Welfare

tions on the Capitol steps, and
state-wide work stoppages that tm
would not be used as the proverbial
‘political football.’ Only then did the
state legislature back off, pass a‘
budget, .and restore full funding.

It is obvious that we at Pitt and
other state-related Universities
have been _ singled out for the
scapegoat role precisely because we
are unorganized, and thus incap-
able, of confronting the budget
crisis. Let us learn a lesson from the
state employees: through uniﬁed
action we have the power to stop
this abuse.

Need ‘Fall’ Training

Fumbles, eight!

Eight?! Eight?! Eight?‘

Well what would you expect?
After all it is natural for a person to
use his limbs to protect themselves
when he falls. So even if one is
carrying something when he starts
to fall, it’s likely that he will drop it,
so he can protect himself with his
hands and arm when he lands. The
torso and head are rather impor-
tant.

Now, ifl want to break a natural
behavior, I'll need to spend a great
deal of time training the. subject in
the intended new behavior, before
the subject ceases to use the old
behavior.

We can spend a great amount of
time and ﬁnally train a cat to play
Ping-Pong; we can spend more time
to train a pigeon to play the same
game. We can even train a rat to
run across a charged plate to
complete a task for a reward, even
though it is not natural for an animal

to do something which is harmful to
it. So, if we want a football player to
hold onto a football, even after he is
hit at eight to twelve “G’s,’ ’ then it
follows that we need to train, and

concomitant with falling and still
holding onto the football. Dorsett
learned it. Matt Cavanaugh learned

- it. Even Bradshaw learned it. But of

course, all of these players were
given a great amount of training.
We wonder why training, and more
training, and more training was not
given to number two man Wayne
Adams’ and number three man Tom
Yewic, because there was every
reason to know that we would need
them, sometime. Can you give us
an answer Mr. Sherrill? No,

editorial in question argued that
the University allowed “the
moral issues to remain

Administration for failing to
defend its professed interest in
academic principles by deciding
to jettison them “if money was
concerned.”

The University has just V_!’Ql_1 a
case against Sharon Johnson

ihich cost it (or, more

curately, the citizens of
Pennsylvania) some $300,000.
This money was spent to defend
the University’s commitment to
academic integrity and to
demonstrate that Johnson’s
claims of sexism were baseless.
However, this judgement did
not generate any useful or
worthwhile social change since
the University was simply
defending itself against a suit
that never should have been
submitted.

However, the expenditure of the
smaller sum has probably done
this more effectively.

As far as what the editorial did

not say is concerned, the truly
worrisome thing about the
Nyden affair is that is
demonstrates how easy it is for
an individual without any
proper grievance to bully the
University by raising the
banners of opposition to
“racism” and “sexism.” From
personal acquaintance and close
observation of some Nyden
supporters, I noticed that the
key themes of “anti—racism”
and “anti-sexism” were
sufficient to compel their
allegiance to Nyden’s cause,
even if the connection between
such themes and Nyden’s

WASHINGTON-For almost nine
years a small battle has been waged
in Congress. As a leader on one side
of the line sees it, “This is a classic
conﬂict between political democ-
racy on one hand and business
interests on the other.”

The speaker is Ralph Nader and
the conﬂict is the ﬁght for the
proposed Agency for Consumer
Protection. This agency was first
’ced to the House in 1968 by

jamin Rosenthal of New York. Since
that time, consumer groups have
been battling with Goliaths such as
Exxon, General Motors, the
National Association of Manufac-
turers and the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.

The ﬁght hasn't been an easy one
for consumer groups like Common
Cause and the Consumer Federa-
tion of America: they have lost
almost every battle. Many versions

 we Consumer Protection bill
‘ ‘have

been through Congress
several times. One of them reached
the President's desk, only to be
vetoed by President Ford.

This time around, prospects for
the bill’s passage do not look
much better, despite the support of
President Carter. Carter sums up
the pessimistic outlook as : “When
we had a President who had
promised to veto the bill, the
Congress was more inclined to give
it support. Now, when it is sure the
White House will approve the

 legislation to set up an agency to
ic.»*‘.V"ﬁ;atect consumers, the lobbyists

have come out of the woodwork and
Congress is under intense
pressure.”

Oh, Those Lines! , ”

By SUSAN MORAN

Everyone has been doing it, yet
no one enjoys it. Waiting in line is

7’ difficult to avoid, especially in the

most crowded areas of campus.

In the Financial Aid office.
located on the sixth floor of the
Student Union, the length of the line
varies from day to day. On one
particular day when 20 people were
in line, a graduate student, who
didn’t wish to be identified, said,
“Today the line is reasonably short,
so I guess I’m going to wait it out.”

Students who were either having
I.D. cards made or picking them up
waited in two very long lines in the
Cathedral. The wait didn’t bother
freshman Mary Hinterlang, a
computer science major. “I know
this is a necessity. It’s really
inevitable. I'm not impatient.”

Most people responded to the
lengthy lines with annoyance rather
than patience. A junior majoring in
history took one look at the line and
said, “This is unreal. Irefuse to go
through this.” He walked away.

Leaving the scene is not an
uncommon way to cope with a line.
Kim Lynn, a freshman majoring in
social work, reacted in this manner
while waiting in the football ticket
line in the Student Union. “I stood
in line for a while and there was
some complication that slowed
down the line. So I took off and
came back later.”

Freshmen have no frame of
reference to compare the length of
this year’s lines to those in previous
years. As endless as today’s lines
seem, the situation has improved
considerably in some campus
locales. A senior in line for football

tickets remarked, “This year, the
lines here are separated alphabeti-
cally, so a person can pick up tickets
by the first initial of his last name.
Last year it was just one big line.”
The campus Book Center lines
appeared long, but they moved
efficiently. The system there has
also improved over the years.
“When the Book Center first

opened, the lines were from one end /

of the store to the other,” said Mary K /F \ Z‘  \ ‘-\
Bonach, director of book centersfcw ‘D   5
“The lines for check and cash J“ ’ 1’ ’

purchases weren’t separate as they 

are now.’ ’

The customer plays a substantial‘

role in how swiftly the lines move, .f
Bonach said. “If the lines for check

purchases move slowly, it’s only “_
because people take so long to write ,

out their checks. When customers \

Protection, (ACP) as written in
House bill 6805, would give
consumers a voice within the
Federal government where, too
often, the only voices heard have
been those of lobbyists and other
representatives for powerful special
interests.

The advocates of the ACP point

out that it would streamline
government, making it more
efﬁcient and responsive to citizens.
Carter has explained that the
combination of the 13 existing
consumer-oriented ofﬁces will re-
organize, not add to, government
bureaucracy.

The opponents of the consumer

bill see it as a costly new agency that
would add to Federal government
bureaucracy. They believe that the
already-existing consumer agencies
should be revamped, if the
consumer needs them. ,
The yearly budget of the
proposed agency would be around
$15 million, or one hour of the

Wilamowski In Retrospect

By KAREN KADILAK
Pin News Staffwriter

As a starting defensive end for
last year’s Pitt football team, Ed
Wilamowski wreaked havoc on
Panther opponents. The tall, lean
end would ordinarily make tackles
in a pop, crash and bang style that
had opposing ball carriers mum-
bling to themselves.

Of course. if you’re a Pitt fan, you
know that Wilamowski doesn’t play
for the Panthers anymore. His
football class graduated last year.

Nevertheless, he keeps in contact
with Pitt football by frequently
visiting the locker room at Pitt
Stadium, either to chat with
ex—teammates (Arnie Weathering-
ton, Jim Cramer, John Pelusi and
Larry Swider all have been
spending a lot of time around Pitt
Stadium these days, helping Jackie
Sherrill and the rest of the coaching
staff in one capacity or another) or to
talk with this year’s players.

During one of his recent stadium
visits, a few days before Saturday's
Pitt-Notre Dame game, Wilamow-

, ski, now employed by a trucking
in downtown Pittsburgh,

ﬁrm
recalled past seasons.

‘ ‘I had a lot of pleasant memories
here,” Wilamowski said as he stood

on the newly-installed artiﬁcial turf.
“Just standing here brings back
the memories. l’ll never forget
’em.” A

The Hopewell Township native
paused to note the improvements
made at the Stadium this year. He
was impressed by the artiﬁcial turf,

en WILAMOWSKI

the new paint_ job which brightens
the old, concrete structure and the
modernized scoreboard.

However, something less notice-
able than those additions caught
Wilamowski’s eye as he looked at
the wall by the corner in the far end
zone. There, spelled out in royal
blue lettering, was the heading
“National Champions.” Seven
years were listed under it, including
1976. For Wilamowski, that ﬁgure
was the best part of the newfangled
Stadium look.

Last year was one Wilamowski
will always remember, and for good
reason. In 1976 both he and the Pitt
football program ﬁnally came of
age. Both player and team made it
to the top. And oddly enough,
Wilamowski probably had his ﬁnest
game as a Pitt football player
against Notre Dame that year.
“Willy,” it seemed, was in on every
defensive play as Pitt whipped the
Fighting Irish 31-10 in the season
opener. ' I

‘ ‘I had a lot of fun playing football
here,” Wilamowski continued.
“The national championship was
really something. Everything

Fightfor Consumer Protection Agency Persists

Pentagon’s budget. The Ofﬁce of
Management and Budget con-
cluded that $20 million would be
freed by consolidating the other
agencies. It also believes that a
single consumer agency will
conduct more efficient consumer
representation activities and also
create a savings for taxpayers.

Esther Peterson, Special Assis-
tant to the President for Consumer
Affairs, said the reorganization will
answer charges that_t_he new agency
will create more bureaucracy at an
increased cost.

“Federal agencies and courts are
making decisions that signiﬁcantly
affect the health, safety and
pocketbooks of American
consumers,” Peterson said, “The
ACP will make sure the consumers’
side of the argument is heard, along
with the arguments of business,
industry and other groups.” -

She also explained that the ACP
will operate a complaint-handling
clearinghouse, to assure that
consumer complaints are promptly
sent to the government department
and/or business that can best
resolve them. The ACP also will
make consumer information and
educational material available to
the public.

The opponents of the bill claim
the public as a whole is against the
agency and that the “vast powers”
of the ACP will make it difficult to
carry on business. But Mark Green,
director of Congress Watch, a
Nader-based group, believes that
the agency will have no political
power or regulatory authority. “All
the agency may do is advocate
before the other agencies, and
occasionally require agencies to
defend the soundness of their
rulings in court,” Green said.

A 1977 Louis Harris poll revealed
an overwhelming 63 percent to 17
percent majority for the ACP.

Ralph Nader, long a strong
supporter of the bill, told a crowd at
a National Town meeting at the
Kennedy Center that he is confident
the bill will pass this time. “A
consumer watchdog in Washington,
with ‘the standing to intervene in
agencyproceedings and in court, is
an essential step to making federal
agencies fairer and more
effective,” Nader said.

Many skirmishes over the ACP
have been held in Washington. In
the latest battle, hundreds of
nickels are being sent to Congress-
men from constituents across the
country. The reason for this nickel
barrage is the “Nickel Campaign, ’ ’
launched by Congress Watch and
the Consumer Federation of
America. The nickel represents the
price each person in the U.S. will
pay to support the ACP.

Some special, targeted Rep-

resentatives have been receiving
hundreds of nickels from their
constituents back home, and for the
most part the campaign seems to be
Many in the Congres-

working.

sional staff members claim the voice
of the constituent is very important
in this case.

Representative Paul McCloskey
Jr. , an opponent of the bill, has sent
all of his nickels to Nader with a
note. “My ofﬁce doesn’t accept
bribes.”

“Bribes?" Nader retorted.

The National Conservative
League, another ACP opponent.
Recently started their own money
campaign, using pennies as their
slogan. This drive is called
“Common Cents.”

Despite substantial opposition
from business, Nader believes the
Agency for Consumer Protection is
badly needed. “Special interests
have spokesmen within the Federal
government. Farmers have the
Department of Agriculture,
Business has the Department of
Commerce. It is therefore illogical
and self-serving for big business to
argue that a $15 million-a-year
agency shouldn’t represent the
consumer voice in executive and
regulatory agencies.’

Nader and other proponents of

For commuters who bus it to
school, the Port Authority Transit
(PAT) is either a best friend or a
worst enemy. In some sectors of the
city, bus service is prompt and
efficient; in others, slow and
undependablé;

But according to PAT, this will
change. Recent announcements of
new buses and better service come
as welcome relief to Pittsburgh
suburbanites.

The PAT Board this summer
authorized submission of an
amended application to the Federal
Urban Mass Transportation Admin
istration (UMTA) for funds to
construct the seven-mile East
Busway.

The Busway, which has a total
expected cost of $110 million, will
be constructed over an existing
railroad right of way from
downtown Pittsburgh to (Wilkins-
burgh, through Shadyside, East

The Board's approval of the

Initial construction activities will
focus on the relocationof two main
lines of the railroad system and the
preparation of an adjacent right of ,
way for Busway construction.

Completion of the entire facility is
set for 1982; certain sections are
expected to open before that time.

The East Busway is expected to
provide highly improved transit
service to anestimated 90,000 daily
riders from the city’s east end and

Since the spring of 1976, more
than half of Pitt's student popula-
tion has lacked a voice in
undergraduate student govern-
ment. With the demise of the
Commuter Association last ye'ar,
commuters’ needs and wants have
been virtually ignored.

Early this year, the prospect for
commuters was looking better.
JoAnn Levinson, a Student Gov-
ernment Board (SGB) candidate
whose campaign was based solely
on promises of better commuter
representation, won in the January
At the time, Levinson
vowed commuter problems would
be her top priority. But according
to SGB member Dave Hesidence,
Levinson did little to ease
commuter problems.

“JoAnn had nothing to do with
commuters after the election,”
Hesidence said. “She campaigned
heavily on behalf of commuters,
but she put little committment into
commuter problems. I chased her
for weeks to get her help and got no
response. During the summer, she
wasn't even in the ofﬁce. I was
under the impression she was
dedicated to commuters, but I was
very disappointed with her.”

Taking the suggestion of former
SGB member Larry Gleason, the
Board appointed an ad hoc
committee on commuter represen-
tation last November. The
committee, chaired by Hesidence,
is trying to create a system to air
commuter grievances.

“The main task facing the
committee is to analyze com-
muters’ needs," Hesidence said.
“We will tie in SGB’s Research

Committee, along with past sur-
veys, to determine and measure
those needs. The committee’s job
is to advocate the interests of
commuters. They will be inﬂuen-
Clng other committees to consider
commuters when planning activi-
ties.

“Pitt is a commuter school and
there are few services geared to
commuters,” Hesidence contin-
ued.

One of the problems facing the
commuter committee will be the
Administration's displeasure over
the condition of the Cathedral's
Commons Room.

According to Hesidence, the
Commons Room, a noontime
meeting place for commuters, is
littered with lunch leftovers and
Burger Chef bags.

“The Commons Room is a
national landmark and a tourist
attraction. The litter and damage
is giving a bad impression,”
Hesidence said.

A 15-day extension of the
afternoon cafe on the Union lawn is
under consideration as an activity
for commuters. The cafe will
include free live entertainment and
free drinks.

' The extinct commuter bandit
may be revived as another help to
commuters. The bandit, a best
friend to car owners, would
intercept the meter maid by putting
a nickel into each meter on which
the time had run out. The bandit
then deposited a note on the
driver’s windshield explaining the
system. The bandit was thanked
time after time, as he saved many a
driver a trip to Traffic Court.

Fall and spring intramurals may
also be organized for commuters on
the Cathedral lawn.

Pennsylvania and Allegheny
County will pay the remaining 20
percent.

Contracts for 190 new buses, all
of which feature diesel-power and
equipment to aid elderly and
handicapped persons, were
awarded mid-summer. Delivery of
the modern buses is expected in
February or March of 1978.

The new buses will permit PAT to
retire many of their older buses,
according to PAT Executive
Director James R. Maloney,
particularly all those not equipped
with air-conditioning systems.

“About 82 percent of our buses
currently are air-conditioned, and
with the addition of the new buses to
our ﬂeet we will meet our goal of
100 percent air-conditioning,”
Maloney said.

“Even more important, the new
buses will mean a dramatic
reduction in automotive failures. In
turn, this will lead to further and
substantial improvement in
schedule reliability.”

The contracts for the buses total
over $14 million.

In addition to air-conditioning
and the latest in pollution control
systems, the new buses will have a

Poet’s Life Goes On Stage

A critic once called her wrok the
longest suicide note ever written.

That may be true, but the power
of. Sylvia Plath’s poetry has
extended far beyond her death in
1962. The life and work of one of the
greatest contemporary women
poets comes alive in Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theatre’s current pro-
duction of ‘ ‘Sylvia Plath: a dramatic
portrait.”

Conceived and directed by Kate
Royston, this play breaks all the
rules of conventional theatre.

The cast is comprised of three
versatile and very capable actresses
—Trish Beatty, Jodie McClintock
and Caryl Opshinsky.

These three women handle all the
roles in the play interchangeably-
Plath’s father, Otto (a world famous‘
entomologist); her mother Aurelia;
her boyfriend Buddy Willard; her
college roommate Doreen; and
other ﬁgures in Plath’s life.

The play begins as the three
actresses, dressed in white robes,
tell the story of Sy1via’s birth and
early childhood. The actresses
assume the roles as the play
chronologically portrays the major
events of Plath’s life; the death of
her father when she was ten, her
years at Smith College as a student
and later as a teacher, her emotional

breakdown, her marriage to the
British poet Ted Hughes, the birth
of her children Frieda and Nicholas,
her eventual suicide.

Plath’s poetry, ‘much of which
comes from “Ariel,” (including
“Daddy,” “Lady Lazarus” and
“Lesbos”) provides the necessary
transitions between the stages in
Plath’s life. ’ -

Caryl Opshinsky, Trish Beatty, and Jodie McClintock tell the story of Sylvia
Plath in the Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre’s production of “Sylvai Plath: A
Dramatic Portrait.”

Manifest Destiny
The Dictators -
Asylum

Andy Shernoff is a regular
middle "class ex-biochem major
whose mother made him take piano
lessons through age 21. That is a
pretty odd background for the head
songmaker of a band from the
punk’n’roll jungles of lower Man-
hattan.

But creating brain-liquifying
manifestos like “Science Gone Too
Far!” beside such wear-your-
heart-odn-your-C-chord classics as
“Heartache” isn’t exactly status
quo for the Lower East Side itself.

Shernoff plays keyboards for The
Dictators, whose keyboards walk as
softly as the second “e” in science.
But who needs an organ when you
can have alter egos like lead
growler Handsome Dick Manitoba
and guitar wiz Ross The Boss?

If they aren’t enough,. there's
always the rhythm section: bassist
Mark “The Animal” Mendoza,
who when inspired plays.his axe
like a punching bag; Richie Teeter,
the singing drummer; and Top
Ten, accomplished gymnast and
Fender Stratocastorian. Most of
these people have forsaken their
true identities in an effort to
become perfect mouthpieces of
Shernoff’s psyche!

Shernoff’s compositions on the
second Dictators album can be-
divided into two. groups. First,
there are the slower, sensitive
pieces, built from tempered chunks
of rock and pop. This is where
_Shernoff__ crafts his melancholic,
bruised vulnerability into song;
examples are the adolescent poetry
of “Hey Boys” and the revelation
‘in “Steppin’ Out” at the core of
this album (“Sentimental thoughts
,from a hard rock kid/trying to

preceive the damage done”).
Other numbers in this class are
appropriately entitled ‘ ‘Exposed , ’ ’
“Heartache,” and the lyrical gem
“Sleepin’ With The TV On.”
To ballast the album are the pure
rock cruisers, the escape songs, in
which Handsome and The Boss take
center stage and usurp the “lost
and lonely boy” of “Heartache”
with the energized sci-ﬁ melodrama
of “Science Gone Too Farl”

The lighting, set and costumes
are suitably simple; it is the talent of
Plath and the emotion-packed
deliveries of her poetry that provide
the mainstay of the performance.

The power of Plath was best
expressed during the reading of
Plath’s most famous poem.

On Poet’sTragic Life

By BETSY NORMAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Kate Royston, an already
proven actress, has once again
shown Pittsburgh, audiences her
ability behind the scenes——this time
as the‘ director of Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theatre’s current pro-
duction, “Sylvia Plath: a dramatic
portrait.”

Royston, who has been with the
Lab Theatre since its birth, had this
to say about Plath:

“She’s aterriﬁc poet. She’s been
made into a lot of other things, but
she still remains a terriﬁc poet.

“I first got interested in Plath
when Iread ‘The Bell J ar.’ Igot into
her as an artist. Then I started
reading her poetry and I found
myself wondering what was behind
it all. Her poetry can stand on its
nwn.

“I wanted people to see her
poetry—-to experience it,” Royston
continued. ‘‘I pulled material from
everywhere for this production.
I've been doing research for about a
year.”

“When I read Barry Kyle’s
version (on which this production is
based), I saw he had left out Ted
Hughes (Sylvia’s husband and
himself a poet). Kyle also edited
her poetry. He chopped it up. I felt
he lacked transition. In Kyle’s
version, the important thing is her
suicide. I.think the important thing
is her writing.

‘ ‘ Plath’s ﬁrst book of poetry, ‘The
Colossus,’ is full of metaphors and
alliteration. You get the sense of
something missing,” Royston said.

‘ ‘She wrote ‘The Bell Jar’ to clean
up her emotional mess-—in order to
get down to serious writing. It’s not
a particularly great novel, but her
‘Ariel’ poetry is just great. By the
time she hit the ‘Ariel’ stage, she
had mastered her craft.”

Royston expressed her belief
Sylvia didn’t mean to commit
suicide.

“She was really into dying. I
don’t think she realized dying led to
death and death was ﬁnal.

“She went through elaborate «

rituals the three ’ times she
attempted suicide, Royston ex-
plained. “It seems as though she
really had this overwhelming will to
live; she planned her attempts as
though she wanted someone to ﬁnd
her before it was over.”

The three actresses in the
cast—Trish Beatty, Jodie McClin-
tock, Caryl Opshinsky—all ex-
pressed their views of the woman
and the poet.

“Sylvia looked at things as
extremes. I’.m disillusioned after
doing this show——disillusioned
about marriage, about me, about
life. She was deliberately’
self-degrading. She subjugated
herself for her husband,” Beatty
said.

“One On One” combines a
couple of standard Hollywood

 Director Gives

Views On Play

(Continuedfrom Page 14)
Jodie McClintock, who played the
lead role in the Lab Theatre’s recent
production of “Kaspar,” saw Sylvia
as many things.

“She was a woman trying to be an
artist; a person trying to keep her
sanity; a mother protecting her

children; a persontrying to cope; a V I

marvelous poet.

“I learned about her happy side.
Instead of seeing her as only a
person who killed herself, I began to
understand her state of mind,”
‘McClintock said.

Caryl Opshinsky, a Lab Theatre
veteran, ﬁrst saw Sylvia as an
“anti-social, depressed person who
was obsessed with death.

“She was actually very ordin-
ary, Opshinsky said. “She dated a
great deal, wrote poetry for her
school paper and was very
outgoing.”

\ "Royston summed it up best--

“The pity is that people label Plath
and don’t explore the total person.
You can’t just label her as one thing
and stop there because—there is so
much more.”

Every woman adores a Fascist,

The boot in the face, the brute
Brute heart of a brute like you.

You stand at the blackboard, daddy,
In the picture 1 have of you,

A cleft in your chin instead of your foot

But no less a devil for that, no not
Any less the black man who

Bit my pretty red heart in two

I was ten when they buried you

mtwenty I tried to die

And get back, back, back to you.

I thought even the bones would do.
But they pulled me out of the sack,
and they stuck me together with glue
And then I knew what to do.

I made a model of you,

A man in black with a Meinkampf look
And a love of the rack and the screw.
And I said, I do, I do.

PEANUT BUTTER PRICES UP

HARRISBURG (AP)"Now’s the
time to buy peanut butter, before
the federal government again
changes the price of peanuts.

Every Oct. 1, the government
resets the minimum price for raw
peanuts, most times upward. Once
those supports are set, the
minimum price stays the same for
another year.

When the price support goes up.

Music Helps Make The Game

(Continued from Page 16)

When Tug McGraw is called in to
bat is Greg Luzinski, and the
stadium sound system jettisons an
electric drum-tambourine beat
whose persistency generates
thunderous clapping.

Luzinski drills a barely fair blast
down the‘ left ﬁeld line. The
animated scoreboard flashes
“Never A Doubt,” then switches to
a cartoon showing a pitcher headed
relief pitch, the organist plays an
Irish ballad.

The organist at Three Rivers does
his own plays on the game. He
starts with the theme song from the
musical “Oliver” when Al takes his
turn at bat and enters with “I was
strolling through the park one day”
when slugger Dave Parker hits.

But Veterns Stadium wins
soundly.

Without Cavanaugh, the offense
was sluggish at best. Neither
Adams nor last year’s savior, Tom
Yewcic, could mount anything
resembling an offensive attack. Pitt
fumbled a total of eight times
(losing ﬁve), threw two intercep-
tions and could register only two
ﬁrst downs in the second half.

The defense, in a spectacular
display, was as good as the offense
was bad. Even though the Panthers
couldn't put any points on the board
after the opening seconds of the
second quarter, the defensive unit
shut off Notre Dame’s scoring
chances and made it look easy.
Time and again, Irish drives that
began in Pitt territory were
thwarted, but the defense could
only do so much.

Notre Dame recovered four Pitt
fumbles inside the Panther 26, but
the Irish were unable to take the
lead Pitt held throughout the game
until late in the fourth quarter.

Fighting Irish)

Notre Dame’s inability to capital-
ize on Panther mistakes was
certainly evident and Irish head
coach Dan Devine felt it may be a
factor in his team’s national
ranking.

“We are deﬁnately short of a

national championship off this
performance,” The 19-year coacli
said.

The Panthers drew first blood
in the game on their second
possession, and ﬁttingly, it was the
defense that set up the score.
Defensive back J .C. Wilson inter-
cepted a Rusty Lisch pass deﬂected
by Dave DeCiccio and returned it to
the Panther 46. From there it took
Cavanaugh 13 plays to ﬁnd Gordon
Jones all alone in the end zone.
Mark Schubert added the extra
point and Pitt fans were once again
thinking national championship.
The Panthers’ only other score
was provided by the defense when
DiCiccio pounced on punter Joe
Restic in the end zone for a safety,
giving Pitt a 9-0 advantage.

 

Pitt defensive tackle Randy Holloway (70) chases down Notre Dame running
back. Holloway made 12 tackles to help the Panthers’ punishing defense

thwart the Irish.

After a second-quarter touch-
down by tight end Ken MacAfee
(the extra-point was blocked) and a
fourth-quarter ﬁeld goal by Dave
Reeve tied the score, the Irish
ﬁnally took advantage of the
Panther miscues. Reeve hit on a
26-yard ﬁeld goal with 5:42 to play,
giving Notre Dame a 12-9 lead it
never relinquished. Minutes later,
halfback Terry Eurick added a
four-yard touchdown run and Reeve
connected for the point after to put
the icing on the Irish cake, 19-9.

Gasparo vie for Kicks

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer
Through all the adversity in the
Panther-Irish contest last Saturday,
one thing’-s certain—Pitt got a kick
out of Joe Gasparovic.

Actually, they got several kicks-
punts of 51, 50, 42, 36, 45 and 31
yards for a total of 291 and a 41.5
average. I

“I was hoping I’d do well,”
Gasparovic said, “though I wasn’t
sure how well I’d do. There was

. some pressure before the game, but

once I kicked that first one (51-blast)
I wasn’t very nervous.”
Gasparovic’s pre-college record
made rivals of Harrisburg’s Central
Dauphin East High School nervous

—a punting average of 44.9 yards, ‘

not to mention action at tight end
and linebacker which put him on
Panther coach’ Jackie Sherill’s
favored “all-around athlete” list.
But Gasparovic almost didn’t
make it as Pitt’s starting punter. No
one seemed to want to ﬁll the void
left by Carson Long and Larry
Swider—two of the most successful
kickers in Pitt’s history. The
atl_1l_e_t_ic department even went as

far as to offer scholarships to

 

student walk-ons who could ﬁll
spots—most notably the two kicking
positions—that returning Panthers
weren’t worthy enough to have.
And so Gasparovic, who was
experimenting at tight end, saw his
chance.

“I knew I’d have a chance-
there weren’t many punters out for
the job,” he remembered, “Al-
though Woody (Jackson) put up a
lot of talent against me.”

But experts still expected Pitt to
drop out of the national limelight
due to lack of any realistic kicking
game. Even the ‘Notre Dame punt
returners were planted ridiculously
closer to the kicker than normal.

“They (the Irish) didn’t think I
could kick,” Gasparovic said
vengefully. “No one during the
pre-season thought we could. But I
thought everyone was wrong——I
knew we could do it.”

And so Notre Dame’s punt return
unit suffered-—scurrying back-
ward‘ for booming _kicks and
scratching out only 28 yards in 5
trials, including a non-returnable
31-yard effort that was downed‘
one yard short of the goal line.

“Notre Dame just thought I was

«

lucky after the ﬁrst couple of kicks, ’ ’
Gasparovic chuckled. “I didn’t
notice them moving back any, so I
just tried to kick it over them.

“As for that 31-yard punt,” he
added truthfully, I didn’t practice
that much—I just hoped it would
bounce, and as it worked out I got
one.”

With a couple more of those
bounces this season, people may be
saying Gasparovic and Swider in the
same breath.

“Larry (Swider) helped me in
every way,” Gasparovic stated.
“He watched me, showed me what I
was doing wrong. He’s the main
reason why 1 improved this year.”

Hopefully Gasparovic will im-
prove as much as there is room to
allow it. I

“I’m going to try,” he decided.
“I think I’ll do as good a job against
everyone else as I did against Notre
Dame.”

And does that mean no more
experiments at tight end?

“I doubt I willdo anything in the
next thre .years but punt,”
Gasparovic said.

A lot of Pitt fans will get a kick out
of that.

Besides the defense, Pitt’s kicking game provided a bright spot for coach
Jackie Sherrill in Saturday’s 19-9 loss to Notre Dame. Freshman punter Joe
Gasparovic responded under pressure and boomed seven punts for 291 yards
and a 41 .5-yard average, including a 51 yard blast-his longest-ettort of the day.

No one was less impressed with
the Irish victory than Pitt’s middle
guard Dave Logan.

“They were supposed to come in
here with so much power,’ ’ he said.
“They beat us but I’m still not
impressed. Really, we beat
ourselves. ’ ’ <

That could be the understatement
of the year, but considering the way
the defense performed in so many

.-"Vf'."\._-.~“"-,_5‘4*“'.”'r.f’;g -‘:91-.;t‘«.-‘t :'< 9 Fee: < t at r estate 4»; as I u u a.- I c 1 I - v -

ideline Panthers 

pressure situations and the loss of
Cavanaugh, there was no disgrace
in the Pitt loss. ’

Still, it was a loss, and the only
way to prevent further losses will be
for Jackie Sherrill to come up with a
quarterback—somewhere,
somehow—who can hold on the the
football.

PANTHER NOTES: The Pitt-
Notre Dame series dates back to
1909 and Saturday’s win boosted
the Irish edge to 30-13-1. Next
year’s meeting between the two
powerhouses will be the last for a
while. Schedules are made up years
in advance and Notre Dame hat
earlier dropped the Panthers from
its schedule because Pitt wasn’t
competitive enough.'..The loss was
Pitt’s first opening game loss in ﬁve
years. It also snapped a 13-game
winning streak, the longest streak
of the major colleges and Pitt’s
longest in 60 years...Linebacker Al
Chesley and tackle Bob Gruber led
the defense with 15 tackles each.
Randy Holloway, who had seven
unassisted tackles, made 12 and
Jeff Pelusi, Jeff Delaney, and
freshman end Hugh Green had 11
each...Sherrill said, “I’ve never
experienced a more frustrating
afternoon on a football field.”

an

Panther Superman Role Now Being   

One of the most memorable scenes from last
football season was this: Robert Haygood, the fallen
hero dressed in a blue-and-gold cape, watching from
the sidelines as his teammates marched to a national
championship.

After the season, however, with Matt Cavanaugh
established at quarterback, Haygood decided his
future as a Pitt football player was not worth playing
out. His pride prevented him from playing behind
Cavanaugh; Jeff Delaney, J. C. Wilson, Bob Jury
and LeR0y Feldr prevented him from playing
defensive back.

Haygood thought he might like to play basketball.
Most 6-21 teams could use a good, quick guard.

Then Matt Cavanaugh had his season interrupted
by Willie Fry’s shoulder pad and Pitt was without a
quarterback capable of handling three consecutive
snaps. And Bob Haygood has a chance to throw off
his cape, don his No. 10, and rush out onto the field
in a possible imitation of Superman——salvaging what

-could be a lost season (7-4 would be a lost season

after a year at the top)in the process.

It is possible. Haygood was in the Pitt locker room
after the game, and the thought of stepping behind
center must have been with him. Someone close to
Pitt football said yesterday that he’d heard talk of
Haygood coming back. Haygood wouldn’t say
anything yesterday, but he’s eligible. All that
remains to be seen is if he’s willing. I’m betting that
if his knee can accept the challenge, so will Bob
Haygood...

If Haygood isn’t playing against William and

Mary, Jackie Sherrill has more problems than do the
non-preferred appropriations. Wayne Adams
looked great in a Johnstown scrimmage against a

 

 

freshman defensive backfield, but against Notre
Dame he brought nothing but gasps———the Cr0Wd W38
too shocked to boo.

Tom Yewcic, the man to whom Pitt owes a
substantial part of last year’s glory, was little better.
With offside calls due to cadence changes, bad
passes, muffled handoffs and botched snaps, Pitt’s
offense (and that of Notre Dame) used Saturday to
re-enact the joke about two ethnic groups playing
football. One team got so mad it quit, and, four
plays later, the other team scored.

. Neither Pitt nor the Irish will be winning any
national championships this year, but Pitt, at least
could have a good season thanks to a defense every
bit as good as the one that saved last year’s
undefeated season. Tony Dorsett and the offense got
the publicity last year, but the defense is what handed
Pitt several of last year’s games and almost held off
the Irish.

To prevent what happened Saturday (Notre Dame
had the ball almost twice as much as Pitt did),
Sherrill must find a quarterback. Rich T rocano
appears to be his man. Trocano, green as Oakland
isn’t, could, in Haygood’s absence, keep Pitt in the
running for a bowl until—and if——Cavanaugh comes

back. His running ability showed at fall camp; his

passing ability is shown by his passing statistics from
high school. Maturity and practice will come this
week—I doubt he’ll be attending many classes—and,
since Pitt could beat William and Mary with Tom
Brzoza receiving snaps instead of making them,
experience will come Saturday... '

Though doctors are said to be attempting to speed
the healing process and Matt Cavanaugh is a
determined young man, he may be thinking about a
red shirt, for several reasons. First, coming back too
soon could lead to a career-ending injury, and
Cavanaugh doesn’t expect his career to end until
after he signs a pro contract. Also, pro scouts will
remember that Matt Cavanaugh hasn’t played any
prolonged stretch of college football without falling
to the ground in some sort of grimacing heap. And it
is not impossible that one of the other quarterbacks
could do an adequate job. Given the play of Pitt
defense, scoring 10 points would probably be an
adequate job...

Pitt’s defense should be Sports Illustrated’s
offensive player of the week given the role it played
Saturday, especially since Pitt’s offensive
performance would have been aided by several first-
down punts. ..

CORRECTION

On Wednesday the Pitt News
erroneously reported that former
Pitt tight end Jim Corbett had been
cut by the Cinncinati Bengals.
Corbett, in fact, is still listed on the
Bengal roster, according to_Pitt’s
sports information office.

Tired of dulll

humor? So are
we, but “tAtwood" is
the best we can do
for the time being.
For an occasional
laugh or small chor-
tle, read “Atwood”

Sooners Trip llandy; USC Rips Misso

“Whew!” gasped the backers of
what was supposed to be the
nation's No. 1 football team.

“Phew! ’ ’ added Oklahoma Coach
Barry Switzer.

The top-ranked Sooners had just
struggled to a 25-23 opening-game
victory over
Switzer was saying that it wasn’t
only whether you win or lose but
also how you play the game. And he
didn't like the Way Oklahoma
played it. _ _ _

“It was the worst exhibition of

Oklahoma football I’ve ever seen,”

he snorted.

- “Mistakes, fumbles, bad execu-
tion, fumbles, mistakes. I am
embarrassed.” '

Vanderbilt Coach Fred Pancoast
wasn’t happy either, but the
officials were the targets of his
wrath.

“As far as I’m concerned, my
team won,” he raged. “You
understand, I’m not criticizing the
ofﬁcials—-not until I see the films.

downing Baylor 17-7 while No, 10
think I saw out there, I’m going to
do some complaining like you never
heard before. There were too many
darn questionable calls for any
football game.”

It was a rather embarassing
afternoon for the haughty Big
Eight, which likes to think of itself
as college football's mightiest
conference. Nebraska, ranked
15th, was upset 19-10 by unher-
alded Washington State, coached
by ex-Nebraska aide Warren
Powers.

Missouri, an upset winner over
Southern California on last year’s
opener, couldn’t do it again and
bowed to the fourth-ranked Trojans
27-10. Kansas tumbled to No. 9
Texas A&M, 28-14, 12th-ranked
Colorado outlasted Stanford 27-21,
and Brigham Young clobbered
Kansas State 39-0.

To save face, though, Terry
Miller rambled for 199 yards and
two touchdowns as No. 20
