‘ THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

  First Yearbook Copy

    T F ' ld
Goes   o itzgera
. By MARlLYN HARTMAN .
The ﬁrst copy of the 1955 Owl was presented to Chan-
cellor Fitzgerald yesterday afternoon, at a reception in the
publications section of the eighth ﬂoor. . .
Jack Caldwell, Owl editor, -presented the magazine, this

year dedicated to Pitt’s retiring chancellor: Reading from
the dedication, he said the staff pledged this record to Dr.

Fitzgerald

“in grateful recognition of his leadership and

Wisdom.”

iHe continued that Dr. Fitz-
gerald, during his ten years as
cancellor, “had maintained mas-
terful control” of advances of
national inﬂuence emanating
from Pitt, and improved every
segment of the ~ University’s
world, although “his direct con-
tact with students and their
best interests had been his prim-
ary goal.”

Caldwell concluded with a re-

mark from the University of Iowa,

when Fitzgerald came to Pitt in
1938, “_‘It is difficult to realize
that he is leaving. Even so, what
can be said, except, ‘Thanks,
Rufus I-I._Fitzgerald, for a job well
done. May you continue your well
deserved advancement.’ ”
The Owl staff also presented
a copy to~Mrs. Mitchell, Director
of the Nationality Rooms pro-
gram, who Was greatly respon-
sible for the color pages of the
Owl. A special copy was reserv-
‘ed for Mrs. Clifford Heinz.
Members of the ‘Publications
board, which Chancellor Fitzgerald
headed when he first came to Pitt,

‘Dean of Women Helen P. Rush,

Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle,
andrmembers of all student pub-
lications were invited to attend
the presentation. '

stub drawing and crowned Knight
and Lady of Pitt. Their dates will
also be honored and the two cou-

Students of Pitt’s Schools of Engineering and Mines will

soon have their own modern

library, because of a Texas
alumnus.

George Bevier, class of 1913, has given the University
$35,000 for the construction of a library on the seventh floor
of the new Engineering and Mines building now under con-

struction. It will be known as theé
George M. Bevier Memorial Li-
brary.

The new library will provide a

and facilities for an adequate
library staff._

The nation’s major engineering societies are one by one

ivoting to make Pittsburgh the engineering capital of the

world. First the electrical engineers voted the move and
last week, the Society of Chemical Engineers authorized a
liason officer to “encourage” plans for the development of
offices here. A

Only the Mechanical Engineers, the American Society
of Civil Engineers and the American Institute of Mining
and Metallurgical Engineers need authorize the move from

s New York to Pittsburgh that will place Pitt in the fulcrum

of the engineering world.

The two organizations that have already decided have
designated a spot in Oakland for their headquarters. It
will be located near the sandlot baseball ﬁeld behind Forbes
Field. ' "" ‘-‘-u

What is so signiﬁcant for us to realize is that the School
of Engineering & Mines willhave available for their use
the research and library facilities of the groups. Combined
with the Carnegie Institute, CIT and their own newly-
acquired library facilities, engineers will have enviable “op-
portunities to advance their status and research efforts.
The location also offers the Founders’ Societies a unique

g position—betwee‘n two major engineering schools. Every-

body will beneﬁt. .

Considering the fact that Pitt E & M student research-
ers will, under a new operation plan, work with Westing-
house to determine uses of peacetime atomic energy be-
ginning this coming year, we can easily see an expansion
in the already increased enrollment of that school and a

nationwide reputation that will do no small amount of good

to help recruit students for other ﬁelds also.

, We await with anxious anticipation the announcement
of the other societies in June to move to the Oakland area.

Evaluating Coronation

Administration ofﬁcials concerned with Women’s ac-
tivities have expressed the democratic concept that it is
the coedstudent who determines what programs should
function. When the women recently found the Guild pro-
gram, as it had functioned for many years, to be inadequate,
they changed it. ‘

In a few days Coronation will have arrived. The pom-
pous ceremony and extravagant features of an un—American
extravaganza will again be featured in the Commons Room.
Memorized speeches will be recited, women in gaudy» cos-
tumes‘ will pound their staves and “Hail to the Queen.”

Many women ‘are not in‘ favor of the program. Others
who sincerely \believe in it have come to the University
for other reasons than to get a liberal education we think.

‘ _It offers little purpose, as far as we ca.n see, other than be-

ing a pretty, static women’s function. And it’s costly.

Again, administration can not assume the greater part
ofresponsibility for the continuity of’ the show. If the
women who seem so wholeheartedly against it once they’re
away from the twelfth floor would refuse to participate
in or support the program, it would not continue. '

We don’t mean to cause a strike, or ‘a boycott of this
year’s proceedings. We only ask the women to watch the
ceremony intently; to evaluate it; to ‘discuss its values
among WSGA or some other official organization; then to
explain to the Pitt News or through Student Congress why
they wish it to continue if they so ﬁnd it a valid element in
American university life.

Mr. Robert Newman, coach of Pitt’s Men’s Var-
sity Debating Association added ﬁre to smoulder-
ing, brimstone when he invited Governor of Penn-
slvania, ‘George M. Leader and U. S. Senator James
H. Duff to debate the proposed Pennsylvania fin‘
come tax program at the association's annual din-

ner this Thursday.
Leader Slammed I

The blow off came when Duff 

shot back his telegram answerto
Newman Monday afternoon. He
slammed.Leader in refusing to
attend the dinner by saying “I
can see no good come from this.

I might as well debate with a 
POLL parrot ‘as with Governor '

Leader. He merely keeps repeat-
ing,information his ghost writ-
ers hand him.”

Thus, Duff threw a‘ damper on.‘
what probably would have been one of the best
political debates since the popular Lincoln—Douglas

speeches of the 1850’s.

Why should a state senator, a Pennsylvania
state senator if you please, ‘divorce himself com-
pletely from the problems of his constituents? ,
Isn’t it his job to represent the people who voted
for him? Even though his adversary is a Democrat
doesn’t the people’s welfare come ﬁrst? It is the
old story all over again—-—playing politics all year

 

people.”

‘Kept Promises‘-—Duff“

Duff went on to explain his position, “It is up
to Leader toexplain his rock-em, sock—em tax pro-
grams. He alone can do it. When I was gover-
nor of Pennsylvania I kept my promises to the

Sure he did. But isn’t he still a representative?

Leader is a new man on the joband, as we can
see, he needs help and plenty of it to emerge

Recently,

successfully from this ﬁnancial mess the state is
in. ‘If Leader’s statements are true, that the Re-
publicansare responsible for the huge deﬁcit, why

Even if Leader does pad the truth, wouldn’t
it be apolitical boon to the state Republicans tb

prestige they have lost over the past few years?

Circus In Town -

By Joan Thomas

It seems that the golden trum-
pets areno longer blaring at the
proverbial judgment days that
follow each spring carnival. The
annual dance is held, intermis-
sion is called, awards are dis-
tributed, and a
few hands are
c l a p p e cl.
Awardees usu-
ally a c c e p t
their trophies

ingly, but on-
lookers h a v e
begun to blink

Vin dissatisfac-
tion, di.sagree-
ment, and dis-
illusionment.

Dissatisfaction creeps in when
participants and viewers are left
completely in the dark. So far
nobody knows
judging is based on, what points
had particular appeal, which
areas needed touching up, ex-
panded, or deleted, what lowered
the rating of shows they con-
sidered good, or just what makes
up originality. Perhaps the
heavy disagreement would be
shed with a little enlightment.

Rating Sheets . A

Rating sheets should be drawn
up, with maximum point possi-
bilities in each category. Each

 

exactly what _

4-

section should be scored indi-
vidually, along with comments
on weak points, reasons for low,
medium, -or high scoring, and
suggestions for improvements.

At the time of the award an-
nouncements, the high-points in
the winning shows, as stated on
the rating sheets, should be
publicized, giving others some-
thing to work for.

Things considered poor by the
judges could be discarded, good
ideas could be better developed,
and theappealing phases kept
on. Soon more winning shows
would result and fatter fi-
nance books would be operating

Helpful Criticism .

The completed rating sheets
should be given to‘ all participat-
ing organizations. With intelli-
gent, helpful criticism, the or-
ganizations would work much
more enthusiastically. It has
often been proved that better
results are achieved when deﬁn-
ite goals have been established.
Right now too many are not sure
what they are. '

And if people are working
towards a good» show with a
sharp eye cocked toward judge
appeal, decisions should be made
only after thorough viewing.
Judges should be drawn from

_ variedprofessional sources. Those

actually qualiﬁed to discern

Things were coming to a head when
Leader broke the ice by inviting Duff to a tele-
vised debate on the state’s financial condition and
the proposed tax program. Duﬁ, as in the Pitt case,

It could be that Duff, a Republican_ from way
back, is holding out for a nation-wide hookupsuch
as the Edward R. Murrow show, “See It Now.”

Don’t look now, Republicans, but one of your
state leaders has dropped the ball.

qualities in the dancing, singing,
writing, construction, sing, and
overall originality and plot,
should be accepted. _
Ban Bands '
Nor should bands be included
in the evaluation. It does not add
up when show crews work long
hours sewing costumes, thinning
paint with turpentine for their
show fronts, and collecting sun-
dry scraps for use on the set,.
and then shell out the $200 neces-
sary‘ for adecent 10 piece band.
People can be trained to dance,
sing, speak, or even smile
adequately for a ,carnival per-
formance, but can hardly become

~~ proﬁicient at playing a musical

instrument after two week prac-
tice sessions. Many fraternities
have‘ members who are‘ talented
in this ﬁeld, and their services
are offered free. Those groups
spend alloted money on addition-

al, good musicians; and therefore

additional, unearned points.

A four piece combo that-pro-
vides a d e q u a t e background
music, should suffice. Too often

, the bands? play roles too large

for them in what are to be fra-
ternity-sorority s h o w s. The

H. money saved by a small band

should be channeled "into more

rewarding, or charitable uses.

Shall we say that‘ music should
be barred? It seems like a pleas-
ant note to endlon.

Letters to the Editor

Cooperation Cited
Dear Editor: ’

It is with deep gratitude that

I write this open letter to the
students of the University of
Pittsburgh. The 1955 Spring
Festival “The Great 48” was the
best ever at Pitt. When Ivsay best
I refer to the cooperation from
the participants and the general
student body. I especially thank
all chairmen and committee
members for their long and un-

tiring effort toproduce this out- '

standing event.
I must give particular thanks
to the Miss Liberty Contest

chairman who established and O

carried through sound basic rules

for the contest. This contest was

of high caliber through student
cooperation and a larger number
of votes were cast than in the
past few years.

Also, I should like to thank the
many University administrators
who were helpful in all aspects
of the festival. 1 should like to
thank each student individually
but being physically impossible
I want to strongly emphasize my

sincere thanks to each student

 

  

who made “The Great 48” really

great.

Editor, the Pitt News:
: Being chosen toirepresent the

thrilling was the effort put forth
by Pitt News, Student Congress,
and the student body and their
families to help me, as Pitt’s en-
try, to win.

If it were at all possible for
me to thank each one of them
personally and individually, I’d
try to do so; unfortunately, I
haven’t had the opportunity of
meeting all the campus'support-
ers. » _

School ‘spirit was certainly
shown? in the contest; and, after
all that has been done to make
this campaign a success, I would
like to extendmy very sincerest,
“thank you.” ‘

SUMER IS ICUMEN IN .

Sumer is {camera in;

Lhude sing cuccu! —

Thus, as every schoolboy knows, begins T. S. Eliot’s immortal
Hiawatha. And no wonder “The Boy Orator of the Platte” (as
T. S. Eliot is commonly called) was moved to pen such light-
hearted lines! For summer (or the “vernal equinox” as it is‘
frequently referred to) is the happiest season of the year, mild “ I
and balmy and contented-making.

Which brings us, of course, to Philip Morris Cigarettes. They,
too, are mild and balmy and contented-making. But that is not
all. They are also genial, placid, and amiable. But that is still not
all. They are, moreover, smooth, paciﬁc, and lenient. But hold!
There is more. They are, in addition, tranquillizing, clement, and
dulcet. 5

Indeed the list could go on and on, until every adjective is
exhausted that would describe the mildness of Philip Morris,
the subtlety of their blending, the delicacy of their ﬂavor. What
more perfect companion could be found to a summer’s day?
What more apt complement to a summer’s night?

If you have been pleased with Philip Morris through the win-
ter and spring—-as who has not who has a taste bud left in his 5
head ?—you will ﬁnd your pleasure compounded, your enjoyment
trebled, when you smoke Philip Morris in the warm and joyous
months before you. ‘

n ‘* ‘

My own planslfor the summer (except that I will smoke Philip
Morris through all my waking hours) are still vague. I‘have been
invited to attend a writers conference, but I don’t think I’ll ac-
cept. I’ve been attending writers conferences for years, and I
always have a. perfectly rotten time. The trouble is that Alexan-
dre Dumas and Harriet Beecher Stowe are always there. Not
that I have anything against these two swell kids; it’s just that it
breaks my heart to see them. They’re.so in love-so terribly de-
voted and so hopelessly! Dumas will never divorce Jane Eyre
while she is with Peary at the North Pole, and Miss Stowe has
long since despaired of getting her release from the "Pittsburgh 4
Pirates. So hand in hand, brave and forlorn, they go from writers
conference to writers conference while Dumas works on his mon-
umental Stove?‘ at Yale. ’

No, thank you, I’ll do without writers conferences this summer.
I think instead I’ll try to improve my ﬁshing. As Izaak Walton
once said, ““No man is born an artist or an angler.” I often turn
to the works of Walton (or “The Fordham Flash” as he is fa- ,
miliarly called) when I am searching for a choice aphorism. In

, cc ,   '99
  . fact, I told him so when we met some years ago at a writers
V . J conference. Walton was accompanied, as always, by Henrik

.~., Ibsen (or “The Pearl of the Paciﬁc” as he is known as). They --
Ibsen (“The Pearl of the Paciﬁc”) and Walton (“The Fordham
Flash”)——were collaborating on Mister Roberts at the time, but
they fell to quarreling and abandoned the project and the world,
as a consequence, was deprived of a truly robust and entertain-'
ing comedy. .

 
  

It is not uncommon, I must say, for writers to fall into dispute.
They are, after all, a sensitive and high-strung lot. I’ll never
forget what William Makepeace Thackeray (or “The Body” as he
was universally called) once said to me. “You show me a good
writer,” said Thackeray, “and I’ll steal his wife.”

Well, as I was saying, I think I'll give writers conferences a
miss this summer, and I recommend that you do the same. Why
don’t you just take it easy"? Swim and ﬁsh and sail and smoke and
read and sleep and tan your lithe young limbs. I want the best
for you because—if I may get a little misty in this, my ﬁnal
column of the year—I think you should know that ‘it’s been real
kicks for me, delivering this nonsense to you each week. '

And in conclusion let me state what Jane Austen (or “Old
54-40 or Fight” as she is called the world over) once said to
me. “Nothing is so precious as friendship,” she said, “and the’

richest man in the world is the one with the most money.”

Indian Cage Star Don Hennon -77 

To Become Panther H oopster

By GENE AROMATORIO

Don Hennon, a pint-sized (5-9) basketball star for Wam-

pum.High’s Indians, and one of the most sought-after school-
boys in the State, announced last night that he would enter
Pitt next fall—he’1l be a Panther. ,

With 61 other colleges throughout the country trying
to land the Wampum phenom, Hennon chose Pitt as the

place to s‘tdy for his medical career, mainly on the advice of. 0

his father and coach, L. B. Hen-6
non. A '

Panther Coach Bob Timmons
had been on the Indian’s trail
ever since the Class B playoffs
ended at the Field House. It.was
at the Field House that Timmons
ﬁrst saw Hennon, although Fresh-
man Coach Carl Peterson ‘had
scouted him earlier. ”

In amassing his amazing record
at Wampum, Hennon in his ﬁnal
season, led the Indians to their
ﬁrst State Championship in as

many years as that small school
has played basketball. The high
school, of only 127 pupils copped
both the WPIAL and PIAA crowns
recently and was the only un-
defeated high school in the state.‘
Some of the records Hennon
has set in the process are: ~96:
points in the WPIAL champion’-,
ship playoffs, 36 points in a single
playoﬁ game, 1,003 points for 31
games, and 2,376 points in four
seasons of play-—a state secord.

Well, Cliif, I’d say the answer to that question depends
largely on your own preferences. In a company the size of
Du Pont there are opportunities for growth along either line.

In my own case, I’ve followed the route of diversiﬁcation

--and I think you’ll ﬁnd that’sAthe general procedure when
a fellow is interested in administrative Work.

For example, after graduation I started work in the re-

search lab at Du Pont’s Niagara Falls plant. That was fol-
lowed by two years of process improvement work, and a
stretch as assistant supervisor over one of the plant areas.
Next, I spent a few years in liaison on the design and con-
struction of our ﬁrst full-scale plant for making nylon inter-
mediates from furfural. Then, I had assignments on “plant

start up,” and production supervision before I was given my
present post. I was made Assistant Director of Research for

The Panthenbaseball team lost to Duquesne. 6-3, in a game
played yesterday afternoon at Mellon. Field. Dick Ricketts hurled
for the Dukes while Ronnie Moog pitched for Pitt.

,Rained out in their last try to play the Panther mit-
ters, those powerful Mountaineers from West Virginia ‘W111
get another crack at the slumping Lewismen this Friday
on their Morgantown diamond.

Currently one of the hottest teams in the district——-and

a sure bet to represent their sec-
tion in the .NCAA playoffs--the

strikeouts a game thus farthis sea-
son, while issuing less than two
walks" iper contest. ,

The locals ' ran their. losing
streak to ﬁve by dropping two
games to Penn State last weekend.
State overcame a four run deficit

in the third inning by pounding.

starting pitcher Ronnie Moog and
_a host of relievers for eleven runs,
and coasted in from there for a

20-5 decision in the ﬁrst game.
John Jacobs’ hitting streak was
stopped at eleven games by
pitchers Stan Larimer and Lynn
Harbold, who combined to hold
the Panthers to ﬁve hits.
It appeared that Don Miller

would salvage some glory for the

Lewismen in the second game as
he_took a two run lead into the
last inning, but he ended on the
losing end of a 6-5 score.

Those old Panther nemeses—-
errors and bases on balls--proved.
their downfall against the Lions.
In the ﬁrst ﬁasco the Lions scored
20 runs on only ten hits—-but they
had 13 walks and were aided by
six Panther errors.

. After Losses to Navy and F &M

No matter how tough Geneva and Carnegie Tech are,

they can’t be any tougher than the Navy tennis squad which I

trounced the Panther nets'ter‘s- 9-0 at Annapolis last Satur-

day. ,

Neither the Covles nor the Ski-
bos, who meet the PI tites on con-
secutive afternoons. this weekend,
will oﬁer the Tullymen the same
kind of competitionthe Midship-
men did. 6 ,

Navy wasn’t the only rough
team the netters met_this past
weekend. The Franklin .& Mar-
shall squad was good enough to
beat the Panthers 5-4 last Fri-
day. ‘

Herb Thompson managed to re-
main unbeaten Friday when he
beat Dave Dubinstein of F'&M,
1-6, 6-4, 6-2. Thompson however,
had his unbeaten string stopped
at nine when he succumbed to the
Navy barrage Saturday.

"Only one other Panther gained
a singles victory this past week-

“ end. Niel Zweig defeated Franklin

Linkers Pun Against Tartans

Following Eastern Appearance

Returning to the home front after ﬁnishing eleventh in
the Eastern Championships at New Haven over the week-
end, the Panther linkers hope to continue their winning Ways
in dual—meet competition against Carnegie Tech Friday.

With a record of six wins and three losses over the season,

_ A
including SlX of their last seven,‘

the McCormickmen will be favor-
ed’ to notch another victory at the
expense of their intra-city rivals.
A win over the Tartans would

assure a winning season by giving ~

the golfers their seventh win of
a thirteen-game schedule.

Playing on the difficult, well-
trapped, Yale course, the duffers
could not keep out of the sand
traps and failed to equal last year’s

ninth place ﬁnish. However, they

were handicapped by having the
minimum four players instead of
the usual six.

Only the scores of the top four
men on each team’ count in the
standings but an extra man or two
might have fared better than one
of the quartet that participated.

The local representatives were

 

Billstockdale, Dick Ryabik, Ken
Fisher, and Jim Zoccola. Standout
performer for the Panther aggre-
gation was Ken Fisher as he miss-

ed qualifying for the individual‘

championships by only one stroke.
The top sixteen were eligible.
Fisher shot an 8l_‘and a 76 in his
two rounds on the par 70 course.
Ryabik carded an 82‘ and an 85
while Stockdale’s 83-94 and Zoe-

.cola’s 86-90 were far above their

Chevrolet "Tlirbo -F ire V8"!

This is the engine that’s writing a
whole new chapter in the book at
automobile performance records. This
is the engine that has stock car timers
doing a ‘‘double take” at their stop-

watches wherever experts” gather to '

compare the abilities of the 1955 cars.

For example, in the recent NAS CAR *
stock car competition at Daytona
Beach, Florida, Chevrolet literally ran
away from every other car in its class
-—and a raft of others besides. In the
one-mile straightaway _run for low-
priced cars, the ﬁrst two pIaces——and

six of the ﬁrst ten—-went to Che.v- ‘

rolets. And in acceleration runs from a
standing . start against all comers,
the Motoramic Chevrolet beat all other
low-priced cars—- and every high-priced
car except one!

What's behind this blazing perform-
ance? A compact honey of a V8 that
only the world’s leading — producer of
valve-in-head engines can build. Chev-
rolet’s new “Turbo-Fire V8”. 2

It puts a new kind of fun in your
driving life. You’re in charge of 16.2
high_—spz'rz'ted horsepower— or if you’re
looking for even -more excitement, the new
“Super Turbo-Fire V8” (optional at

extra cost) puts 180 12.1). under your toe!

Pick the one you’d rather have fun
with, then come in and get behind the
wheel. You’ll see why the Motoramic
Chevrolet is showing its heels to every-‘
one else on the road!
