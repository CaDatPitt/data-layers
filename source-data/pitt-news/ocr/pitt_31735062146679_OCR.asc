“One local bootlegger in Madison

Volstead Law has been an ineffec-
tive weapon to stop drinking," the
editorial continued. “Its failu-re

‘ shows that it is impossible to-- legis-

late morals, and that abrupt changes
wreak much‘ havoc with the youth

Activities Man Scholastic In-
ferior to Student Without
Extracurricular Interests

Do the students who are hard
workers in activities make the scho-
lastic honor roll?

A few of them do. _’But Pitt stu-
dents in activities ranked 30 per-
cent lower scholastically than stu-
dents not in activities, last spring,
according to statistics compiled
from the 1926 Owl, Of the 600
students in activities, only 72, or
12 percent, made the honor roll. Of
all the 2,079 students not in activi-
ties, 370, or 17.8 percent were honor
students. ' -

Three-tenths of one percent of

spring were athletes, includingione
‘football player, three co-ed basket-
ball players, and two members of
the riﬂe team.
‘ In non-athletic activities,‘ 66 stu-
dents out of a total of 409 partici-
pating, made the honor roll, a per-
cent rating of 16.1.‘ . nactive stu-
dents maintain a ‘ substantially
higher average, statistics show.
Tables comparing numbers "of stu-
dents in various activities who made
the honor roll with non-active stu-
dents on the roll are given elsewhere
in the Weekly. '

Coal ‘Prices’. to Stay

Cost of coal will continue at its
present high level for several weeks,
in the opinion of Dr. M._ O. McKay,
head of the department “of Eco-
nomics.

  Unwillingness on the part ofthe
 ; mine operators‘ to open the mines

with Union labor has caused prices
to-soar, Dr. McKay believes. Oper-
ators prefer to employ non-union men
: at exceptionally high wages to break
the strength of the Union, he says.
Dr. McKay believes that coal mines‘

- should be declared a public utility

ment. ‘

S_ '-QUEEN MARIE’S VISIT

. ir:

.Y,our column last week recorded
the "coming of an event of un ara-
in the e uca-
tional realm. I refer to the.pro--
jected ‘visit of Her Royal ‘Magesty,

-, .

Queen Marie of Roumania, to the .

University of . Pittsburgh, for the

purpose of receiving an honorary de~ ,

gree. It is partly with a view of
instilling in the minds of all right-
tbinking students the duty of doing

their utmost to make the reception

of the lovely Queen one that shall _be
in keeping with her royal dignity
that I write this letter. If any
should be tempted to falter, let us
shame them with the remarkable
devotion of those hundred youths
who are willing to risk their very
lives “to protect the path of the
Visiting Queen.”

A ‘still more important purpose, .

however, impels me to the action
I am taking. A delicate situation
has arisen. NThe University rulers,
according to accounts, are in a quan-
dary concerning the kind of degree
most’ beﬁtting the sterling qualities.
of the illustrious Marie. May your
humble correspondent submit a few
suggestions ‘2 .

Why not a degree of Lit.D. in
recognition of the Queen's. literary
achievements? From her proliﬁc
pen there has proceeded a veritable
deluge of newspaper articles every
whit as incisive "and profound as

anything -ever written by “Peaches” _

Browning or Beatrice Fairfax. Or
how about 9. LL. D. in appreciation
of her proﬁciency in statecraft?
Probably few rulers of modern times
have shown greater skill in sup-
pressing every activity and utter-
ance that would challenge one of
the most reactionary and oligarchic
governments in Europe.

Would a Ph.D. for her contribu-
tions to political. science be inappro-
priate? Surely the merit of the fol-
lowing should not go unacknowl-
edged: “I do not believe in equality.

God made one class‘ higher than

another. Some of us havevbeen born
to ahi hrplace. Mine happens to be
the big eat of all. ‘ Go - put. me
here.” , ‘ _

Finally, there is nothing to pre-
vent her being awarded a degree
of ~S’c.D.'in recognition of her busi-
ness acumen. Lest some think this

inconsistent, it should be added that

this honor was bestowed on no less
Out

of the learned.Judg‘e.

These Suggestions I submitin the
hopes that they may assist in solv-
ing a perplexing problem. I ...l‘l'l

‘motivated also by the desire to as-

sui-e.the student body that the Uni-
versity has in mind the sole ob-
ject, of rewarding» achievement and
rendering to genius its just‘ deserts.
Of ‘course, it might be mentioned,
but the point must not be empha-
sized, that “should the Queen be.
unable to visit" the school she will

not get the honor.” M , - _

The‘ American. Iona Society‘ has
made the ﬁnal arrangements to
erect 1a $10,000 college of Celtic

MRS. SPENCER SPEAKS

  

Mrs. Anna Garlin Spencer, Co-
lumbia University, gave an address
on “Mutual Decisions Men and
Women Should Make Before Mar-
riage in Order to Insure Happi-
ness in Family Life” at Heinz
House yesterday noon under the
auspices of W. C. E. , She’
pointed out the basic principles of
the home as an institution. That
modern marriageis. a contract and
should be made -with the_ perfect
understanding of those concerned,
is her belief.

lntollectuals Blamed I _
F or Starting Of‘ War,

“The intellectuals were chieﬂy re- ,

sponsible for the world war,’.’ said‘
Dr. Gerhart von Schulze Gaevernitz,
professor of Econornics, University

of Freiburg, Monday afternoon at‘

Heinz House. His subject was “In-
ternational Intellectual Co-opera-
tion.” Dean Louis K. Manley, School
of Business Administration, presided.
The lecture was held under the aus-
pices of the social science seminar.
Historians were also partly to
blamefor the recent war, thinks Dr.
Gaevernitz. The great present need
is the conversion of students, pro-
fessors and intellectuals? to a cos-
mopolitan view of life, he says. In-
tellectual disarmament, abroad as

well as in America, is a real neces-

sity, says the German economist, who
believes the development of inter-
national f scholarships will promote
the movement of students and profes-

-sorsto European schools and a closer

international co-operation.

Dr. von Schulze Gaevernitz is head
of the St ientiﬁc section of the League
of Nations Commission on Interna-
tional Intellectual Co-operation. .

Bishop, Joseph B.: "NOTES
AND ANECDOTES OF
MANY YEARS." .

“In his long experience on
the editorial staff of three New
‘York newspapers, Mr. Bishop
has met and known many fa-
mous personalities.‘ Anecdotes
of the great and near cling.to
every. page and keen delight
will be takenvin readingpthis
quietly humorous and good-
natured book.” '

Chancellor, E. Beresford: “THE
LONDON "OF THACKE-
RAY.”

“H e re, charmingly. illus-
trated by a number of old
prints, isthe London. known to J
the Newcomes and Pendennis,
and the effect "upon the reader‘
is to want to sit down immedi-
ately and readjThackeray all
over again.” .

Gildei-,' Rosamond, »ed.: “LET-
TERS OF RICHARD WAT-

< SON GILDER.” _

“In the book will be found’,
expressed in his letters or set,
forth in the connecting narra-
tive of’ his daughter, the full
current of life of ‘one’ of. the‘-
.. most vital and variously in-'

 

ﬂuential A In e r i c a n s of his

time.” _ - ’ _

Guedalla Philip: “A GAL-. '
LERY. . '.

“A galleryvof many literary
and political ﬁgures. The au-V»
thorl has wit and intellectual
responsibility; he is fre uently
unappreciative, frequent y one-s "
sided, but he is never ill-
natured.” ‘

,Kennai°d, Joseph S.: “GOL-
DONI AND THE. VENICE
OF HIS TIME.”

“This famous Italian play-
wright, 1707-93, is an imper-
sonation of the Italian modern '
character, both to those who,
across his charming Person-
ality, are desirous to compre-
hend the soul of modern Italy
and to those who trace out of
it a resemblance to their _own
soul. The book givesthe his-

. torical and literary background

of Go1doni’s life and work."

M Mason, Daniel G.: “CONTEM-
PORARY COMI-"OSERS.”‘_
“For his contemporary com-

posers the author has selected
those who in his judgmentare
carrying on the_ great. tradi-

. ing and well written, it is a
most able and authoritative»
volume.” -

TERTAINMENT.” W
“This book provides a1 run-

ning commentary on books" and

their authors. Material not

the information, both bio-
graphical and critical, is pre-
sented' in a most readable

Train, Arthur: “THE NEE-
- DLE’S EYE.”

“A novel of unusual scope
and vitality. In its descriptions

niﬁcant than the average. fic-
:ion of the day.” '

Walpole, Hugh: “JEREMY.?f
“Engaging story of 8. little.-
eight-year—old English boy. ‘A

[Editor’s Note--This istlie fourth of I
series of interviewswitli leaders in campus
activities. The ‘purpose is not only toglvo
new students of the University an idea

 

the activities concerned,‘ but also to present 3‘

an intimate picture of campus lift]-

 

“I think .it’s the greatest. thing '

that’s happened to me since I came
to Pitt,” said‘ Katherine C.. Rowell,
editor of the 1928 Owl, when asked
about her appointment. ,

“I anrwriting a theme on In

said Alfred M. Lee upon being ques-
“The
ﬁrst part deals with my childish‘ am"-

_ bitions.on ﬁrst taking office.”

“And .I think I’ll enjoy my work.

I learn so much from the printers‘

and the ‘cngravers and the others I

have to deal with, you know.” (Miss.

Rowell.) .
“But how's a girl going to swear
at the printer?” asked Lee after dis-
cussing the appointment of his suc-
cessor. . '

“Getting the magazine together
will be interesting, too. Dont you
think so?” (Miss Rowell.) ' ~

“Another part of my theme de
scribes how I had to pull the last of
the copy out of my staffby main
force and how I worked from twelve
to four in the morning pasting the
dummy.” .(Lee..)

A striking contrast between the
feelings of the new and past editors
of the Owl toward the office appear-
ed in the two interviews. P

Lee’s forthcoming theme describes
his career in several well marke/d off
divisions. First _he takes up his
childish ambitions on ﬁrstbeing ap-
pointed; the worst part about his
original ideas. says the 1927 editor,
is that he cai..ied some of them out.
The highly efficient methods of ap-
pointing his staff take up another
section of the theme; Lee became
highly sarcastic at this point. A
third section deals with the asinine
method employed in choosing him-
self as editor; he does not ,wish to
criticize the method, employed "

Co-eds may storm about equal‘

office is given a certain number of
points accordmg to the discretion of,
thecommittee. When 2; student is
found tobe carrying more than the

is ten, he is notiﬁed by the commit-
tee to drop an activity. If he chooses,
he may petition, in whichcase, his
scholastic record is investigated and
a copy is sent to each of the nine-
members of the committee. A major-
ity vote of the committee isrequired
before the student can continue ‘in
all his activities. This system of pe-

_hole through which the persistent
office-seeker can hold many posi-
tions, Dean- Harrison says. Instead,
-it is an Opportunity to measure
‘every student according to his indi-
vidual ability and not subject him to
aset of cast-iron, rules. ‘

The highest number of points as
signed to any office is eight, Har-
rison stated. Editorships of the three
major student publications are each
rated. eight points._ The ‘presidency.
of the Interfraternity Council is four
points‘ while the presidency of the
Pan,-Hellenic association;-‘a similar
co-ed organization, is" seven points.

How this system helps-V‘-in the dis-
tribution of oificese andetheir accom-
panying honors is seen in- the ratings
of three of the co-ed offices. Pre'-
idency of a sorority counts ve
points and the president of-the Pres-
idents’ Council, an organization of
sorority presidents, c.eunts‘"two. In
addition, there is the office of pres-
ident of the Pan—He1lenic associa-
tion, which counts seven points. It
would be impossible for one girl to
hold "all three of these offices at the
same time without having, recourse
to the petition. Managers of foot-
ball, basketball " and ‘track squads
are each charged with eight. points,-
while the managers of swimming,
cross-countryiand tennis teams are
only charged three points- Some of
these’ points are only effective for
one semester, when the bulk of the
work is done. The football‘ mana-
ger is only charged withfour points
the -second semester and the tennis
manager is not credited with any
points until the secondsemester.
Members Of the point—scale com-
mittee are W. Don Harrison, dean
of men, chairman; John Johnston,‘
assistant dean of men, secretary;
Thyrsa Amos,'dea.n of women; El-
len W. Geyer, of the College faculty;

Saturday by negotiating the. Pan-

almost unbelievable time of 27 min-
utes, 48 seconds. He broke the rec-
ordﬁset byoffenhauser of State last.

after ﬁve‘Orange men had crossed
thelline, were Ted Gorski and Wood

mostimportant. _ M 
‘Commenting on‘ the progress of the
‘school, the. chancellor _;says:, “The
interest which the citizens have taken
in the University is good; They have
given time‘ aand‘.mon_ey. They re-
gard the Universitywith more un-
derstanding; they accept more re-
sponsibility for it; they see in it an
expression, in eternal language, of
their aims to bring-‘about a better
Pittsburgh.” ‘B ' '
“Teaching is the primary active

inﬂuence of the University,” says’

Chancellor Bowman. “Whatever oc-
curs to a student in the University,
whatever happens there to help him
grow, will be largely, affected b -the
teacher,” says the report, ,a 'ng:
“Buildings, however good and beau-
tiful, and libraries andflaboratories
and curricula adjusted to all grades

and teniperaments—-these are noth-‘

ing unless we have good teaching.
The strength of a_ university lies in
the strength of its teachers.” '
‘Chancellor Bowman concludes his
reportlbyfsaying: “As "we look at
the problems of the University——stu-
dents, ‘teachers, and buil_ding'._need——-
it seems clearly wise to'try now, as
our next major project, to make
teaching better,‘ to cultivate and to
strengthen _-teaching as a‘cre_ative art.

L And ﬁnally, over all, there .is satis-
faction in bringing ourselves, by,

whatever we can do, to .love_wisdom
and to suffer‘ other men to obtain it.”
