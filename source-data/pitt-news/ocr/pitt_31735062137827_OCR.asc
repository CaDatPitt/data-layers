Freshman House
Rules Announced

 

Approved Homes List Ready
For Out-Of-Towners

 

Regulations for freshma.n housing
have been announced by N. Robert
Seidle, newly appointed assistant to
the dean of men. The contracts which
students are required to make with
the householder must be ﬁled not
later than September 29, at the Men's
Housing bureau, Room 801 Cathedral.

An adequate list of approved homes
is available this year to out-of-town
students who are not living at a fra-
ternity house or with relatives. Fresh-
men who are not living in approved
homes must obtain the written ap-
proval of one of their parents ab-
solving the University of all respon-
sibility in connection with living
quarters and submit such approval to
Mr Seidle at once.

“Freshmen should be very careful,”
Mr. Seidle advises, “in their choice
of fraternity and should give greatest
consideration to the members in the
chapters which they visit, rather than
to the national standing or luxurious
furnishings in the house. While na-
tional recognition and ﬁnancial sta-
important factors, they
should not be placed ahead of the
character of members of the frater-
nity.”

The Housing bureau ha.s a great
many more rooms available than
necessary, and is also able to advise
upper classmen, graduate students,
and faculty members of available
apartments or rooms. An estimate of
average weekly rates is app-roximate-
ly $9.75 for room and board.

Carnegie Report
Gets Hint From

Held Satyricon

Vvellsburg has its “marriage mill,”
where a license is just something for
which you pay the clerk two dollars.

But then the state of Pennsylvania
has its “diploma mill,” (a term ap-
plied in reviews of the Carnegie Foun-
dation report on the colleges of this
state), the diploma having just about
as much signiﬁcance as a Wellsburg
marriage license.

After a six-year study of 49 institu-
tions in the commonwealth, including
Pitt, Carnegie Tech, and Duquesne,
the Foundation has discovered that
thousands of boys and girls are wast-
ing four years of their lives and four
thousand dollars of their parents’
money in order to get a degree that
means almost nothing.

The conclusions of the report are
based on the results of a test on
which college seniors made scores 30
per cent lower than did high school
seniors four years younger. The
Foundation especially lamented the
fact, disclosed by a vocabulary test,
that in four years the college senior
had managed to add only seven words
to his vocabulary. His knowledge of
100 representative words had in-
creased from 57 to 62.

Several years ago the Foundation
disclosed the startling news that col-
leges paid money to their football
players. Today, after laborious re-
search, they have unearthed what
John Held has known for a decade:
that the average collegian’s vocabu-
lary is limited to two words—“swell”
and “lousy.”

 

McKay Reviews Taxes

The next state Legislature will be
forced to impose new taxes in order
to raise the necessary revenue for
relief, Dr. Marion K, McKay, pro-
fessor of economics, told the Rotari-
ans yesterday evening at a meeting
in Carnegie. Dr. McKay’s topic was
“The tax situation in Pennsylvania.”

Registrar Says
Freshman Gain

May Be Offset

Although no deﬁnite ﬁgures can
be given for registration, indica-
tions for freshman registration
point to an increased enrollment
over ﬁgures for the past few
years. However, J. G. Quick, Uni-
versity registrar, said, “VVhile
there will be an increase in
freshman registration, a falling
off among the students in the up-
per classes may balance the total
registration so that there will be
no increase in total enrollment.”

Deﬁnite registration figures will
not be available until possibly
early next week, '

Women Prepared
For Mentor Aid

41 Seniors Complete Training For
Freshman Advisory Work

 

Forty-one senior women completed
yesterday an intensive three-day
course in preparation for their work
as senior mentors, or advisers to
freshman women, which positions they
will assume tomorrow at the assembly
for freshman women.

The mentor system replaced the
big sister movement on the Univer-
sity campus nine years ago. During
the time they ‘aid freshman women,

the department of the dean of we-
men and as aides to the University
in the freshman orientation program.
Senior mentors were chosen on the
basis of scholarship, participation in
activities, reﬂection of the University
ideal for its women, and general in-
terest and spirit in the University.
Senior women who will serve as
mentors are: Adele Ash, Jane Ban-
_vasz, Helen Bart, Mrs. Anna Berry,
Betty Bowser, Helen Bruun, M.axine
Christensen, Frances Dent, Muriel

Marian. Epping, Helene Green,

Hovey Shows Photographs
From Fine Arts Library

 

Walter H. Hovey, p-rofessor and act-
ing head of the Fine Arts department,
has arranged an exhibition of photo-
graphs to be displayed all during regis-
tration week in Room 1001, Cathedral.
The display will be composed of six
exhibits, each exhibit giving an in-
sight into one of the courses offered
this semester by the department,

Included among the exhibits are
two very valuable original Russian
icons. These icons, ancient paintings
on wood, are actually mouldy with
age. This and other material has been
taken from the ﬁles of the Fine Arts
library, which is always available to
the public.

composed of members of the adminis-
tration, faculty and of representative
students.

Until Friday morning, October 5, at
8:30 o'clock, no member, pledge nor
alumnus of any fraternity may ap-
proach a newly registered student on
fraternity affairs, invite him to the
fraternity premises nor entertain him
in any way. The rushing period will
extend until 2 o’clock, Sunday morn-
ing, October 14. During this period, a
rushee may be the guest of one or
more fraternities as op-portunities are
afforded him, but in no case may he
remain overnight at any fraternity
house, nor the home of any member
of the fraternity-

‘Record’ Treats
Tizrner’s Case
In Last Issue

 

From the Amazon to Brookings In-
stitution; from Nazi Germany to an
American university mark the inter-
est of the articles appearing in the
September issue of the Pittsburgh
Record," quarterly alumni magazine of
the University of Pittsburgh,

The editor, Don F. Saunders, in his
“Matters of Record," has some per-
tinent comments on current and past
issues of the University. Among
these are comments on Dr. Ralph Tur-
ner’s dismissal from the University,
and the change in the policy of the
Record.

This new policy is to publish a
supplementary pictorial magazine in
which will be concentrated news of
the al;1mr.i and illustrations of vari-
ous events and personalities connect-
ed with the University. The Record
still will be the official magazine of
the Alumni association and again will
concentrate on the publication of in-
teresting and stimulating articles.

Among the articles in this issue
are: “Exploration in Green Hell,” by
Dr_ Samuel H. Williams, professor of
zoology, in which he tells of the ad-
ventures that accompany scientiﬁc re-
search in the Amazon jungle.

“America’s Capacity to Produce,"
by J. Steele Gow, Pittsburgh indus-
trialist and director of the Falk foun-
dation, is a review of the ﬁrst results
of a study made by the Brookings In-
stitution to determine if economic
progress in America is deterred by
maldistribution of wealth and income.

“Four Weeks in Nazi Germany,” by
J. F, L. Raschen, professor of modern
languages, give his impressions of a
Hitlerized Reich.

Jennings Hammer, an instructor in
English, clariﬁes some puzzling points
of correct English usage in the arti-
cle, “Clarity Preferred.”

Another scholarly article, titled
“For VVhom Is the Graduate School?"
an analysis of the function of the
graduate school, is by former Dean
L. P. Sieg, now president of the Uni-
versity of Washington.

‘Students Meet
School Deans
After Session

Athletic Confab, Dr. Lanfear’s
Conference Also Scheduled
Today And Tomorrow

Nine hundred freshmen oiiicially
entered University life this morning
at their ﬁrst assembly, in the main
auditorium of Meinorial hall.

Dr. John G, Bowman, Chancellor of
the University, delivered the welcom-
ing adlress to the new students. “Do

you know what you want to do? Do
‘you know what you can do best?” he
inquired as he began.

“These are important questions,”
Dr. Bowman declared. “But if you
say ‘No’ to them, I should answer,
‘Well, don’t get down about that.’
Now I want to ask some questions to
which I hope, out of the depth of
your heart, you will impulsively say
‘Yes’.”

“Do you want
know?” he asked.

“Have you the cheerfulness, the
ready attention, and the good man-
ners that make people glad that you
are around?

“Does that something we call
beauty, let us say in a tree or :1 dan-
delion or a sunset or in music or in
the character of a friend, sometimes
bring you a sense of victory and open
to you a spiritual conception of the
universe?

“Have you the character and the
will to try steadily to become a cre-
ative and intelligent part of that uni-
verse?”

“If,” the Chancellor concluded,
you can honestly answer ‘Yes’ to these
questions, a light is in you beyond
which there is no darkness, You are
started upon a great life. Your native
sense tells you, I think, that your op-
portunity here is not primarily to
learn how to earn a living. It is to
enter into the wonder, bea.uty, knowl-
edge. and spirituality of the world and
of life.”

Presiding over the meeting was Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men, In-
vocation was delivered by Dr. Samuel
B, Linhart, secretary of the Univer-
sity.

Beginning at 11 o’clock this morn-
ing, students are scheduled to meet
with the deans of their respective
schools. Conferring with the fresh-
men will be Dr. Herbert L. Spencer,
dean of the College, Dr. Charles E.
Prall, who will meet with pre-educa-
tion students, Montfort Jones, pro-
fessor of accounting, who will pre-
side over a meeting of Business Ad-
ministration students, and Dr. E. A.
Holbrook, dean of the School of En-
gineering.

This afternoon the men’s athletic
assembly will feature VV. Don Har-
rison, director of athletics, and the
varsity coaches. The meeting is
scheduled for the main auditorium of
Memorial hall. ,

‘Freshman men’s conferences with
Dr. Lanfear and with their upper-
class counselors will take place to-
morrow afternoon. After Dr. Lanfear
has explained the functions of his
ofﬁce, the student advisers will meet
with their groups, explaining the pur-
pose of fraternities and distributing
the Freshman and lnterfraternity
handbooks.

A majority of the- new students
have already completed registration,
and those entering advanced classes
in foreign languages took their place-
ment tests in Memorial hall Monday
morning. According ,t,o,,statistics re-

Rising Enrollments

After declining for four years, en-
rollments at the University have
turned about and are rising consider-
ably, according to early estimates
from the office of the registrar.

An increase of approximately 13 per
cent over last year is indicated by the
number of freshmen who had made
application for admittance previous to
September 17.

Just what sort of an index this in-
crease may be, when commercial in-
dices are kicking about at despondent
levels, is interesting and uncertain.
Certainly the fairly large number of
Federal jobs available under FERA
have encouraged students who would
otherwise have lacked necessary part-
time work. But FERA funds can em-
ploy only about a quarter of those
seeking that aid, and such funds can-
not largely have inﬂuenced the en-
rollment of new students, in whose
registration the increase appears.

Moreover, parallel gains are expect-
ed throughout the United States, with
the biggest increases promised in the
Middle West, where leading schools
anticipate from 5 .to 15 per cent
greater enrollment. The Vxfest and
the East show smaller gains, while
Ohio State declares 52 per cent more
freshmen than last year,

Such general increases in the face
of a lowered standard of living must
have one cause: faced by the con-
tinued blocking of employment pos-
sibilities, high school graduates are
betting and borrowing on college
“training,” as it is called.

If this explanation be maintained,
then this University and other Amer-
ican universities need to question the
desirability of training more men and
women, with the paraphernalia of
credits and degrees, for jobs which do
not exist.

Freshman Week

In the last four years freshman
week has been expanded so generous-
ly that freshmen nowadays need a
freshman week-end to recuperate,
physically and socially, from the in-
tense hospitality.

In the old days (it was back in
1931) a freshman found his way to
not more than two of the Memorial
hall convocations, including the Thurs-
day night banquet for men, and man-
aged to explore by himself the geo-
graphical and intellectual mazes of
the University in spare moments.
Those were the days of rugged indi-
Vidualism, and save a conducted ele-
vator trip to the battlements of the
-Cathedral we considered ourselves
unregimented. -

This week, however, freshmen en-

tering the University have stepped
into a planned society. Meetings,
convocations, conferences, advice

about fraternities and advice against
fraterllities sweep the new students
about the campus with military pre-
cision. Seldom in the next four years
will a freshman feel the press and
bustle of his group signiﬁcance so
keenly,

Doubtless social planning is the
coming science, and doubtless the
freshmen of these days require more
varied and more concentrated in-pour-
ings than those freshmen of the old
days. So many things have happened
since 1931, as the newspapers would
say. But if towers topple and if grass
grows in the streets, our suspicion of
these innovations will be conﬁrmed.

youths were "jazz-crazy and sex-
feverisli” there would be several

thousand fewer students sent to col-
lege.

Nor does there seem to be any pos-
sibility that the average college stu-
dent will be mistaken for :1 Com-
munist. College groups, it will be re-
membered, were among the few
groups that voted for Hoover in the
straw contests of 1928. And though
the supposition leans perilously to the
inevitable intercollegiate poll, college
students are about as interested in
preserving the ideas of their elders
as their elders themselves.

But Mr. Leach has exhumed an old
myth, Flaming youth passed long
ago.

College Editors
The organization in New York last
week of 30 student editors into the A2-
sociation of College Editors, represent-

ing universities and colleges in East-,

ern United States and Canada, antici-
pates more than just another annual
soup—and-ﬁsh with the editors wearing
dinner jackets, The threefold aim of
the association is to arouse student
interest in promoting peace, good
8‘0Vernment and a. higher standard
of living.

The proposed covenant sets forth
the purpose as follows:

“To stimulate the interest of
students throughout the world in
promoting international under-
standing and cooperation in the
hope of ultimately achieving an
enduring international peace and
security; to arouse the students
in the several countries to seek
to understand and obtain an
honest, intelligent and efficient
government; to enlist the aid of
all students in securing a higher
and sounder standard of living in
the spirit of the greater good for
the greatest number.”

These aims are suggestive and gen-

commanding your fatigued attention
with sharp glances; leans your typi-
cal potential columnist giving vent
to one of his orgies of expressionism.

O1’, to localize. him, you find him at
that serious center of intellectual ac-
tivity, the News office, distracting the
desperate efforts of newspaper men
bent on plunking out copy not more
than two hours after deadline; his
strident voice booms above the clatter
of the typewriters, and squish of copy
pencils, and the modulated tones of
the editor to inform the oflice deﬁ-
nitely of the last word about Hitler,
Dick POWe11. or that new waitress at
the Tea room.

Sometimes his phrases blossom
like wild orchids or skunk cabbages
with plays on words——puns, to the hoi
polloa; sometimes every ﬁfth word is
a queer sort of French; sometimes he
gets you to know more about good ol.‘
Schnozzleville, Tennessee, than the
good ol’ Schnozzlevillians, pillowed in

typical potential columnist.

ple have died mute, inglorious Mil-

teresting to observe that the 30 mem-
bers of the association represent the
leading colleges for women, the Naval
Academy, and the traditionally disil-
lusioned “big three," as well as urban
institutions such Columbia and Tem-

About Titles

S IS VVIDELY known (Maulsby

and his journalists will appra-
ciate the high quality of grammatical
precision in that phrase), one of the
hardest tasks of the prospective col;
umnist is choosing a general title to
head his art. This is 34 years into
the twentieth century, you know, and
there have been titles even since
papyrus was invented. Really, the
job is difficult. Solomon has assured

us sadly that there is nothing new un-,

der the sun, and the great man said,

Such a pro- I if not practiced, wise things. Yet the

gram has been repeatedly suggested , columnist must hit on a word combi-

by former and present college edi-
tors interested in disproving charges
of insularity and imniaturity in col-
lege life. The new association should
indirectly acquaint American stu-
dents——where they have yet to be
acquainted — with the fundamental
similarity of campus and post-cam-
pus opportunities.

the Connecticut College News lists
the following: Ping Pong (Univer-

(Oglethorpe university), horse shoe-
ing (Michigan State college), charm
(Rollins college), sleeping (University
of Texas).

About Content
LL RIGHT, I’ll admit I haven’t
given you a ghost of an idea yet

about. what subjects this column is
going to bore you with for the rest
of the season. But I had an insidious
purpose in leading you along gently.
Frankly, I don’t have more than a
vague notion about the ensuing ma-
terial myself, By a vague notion I
mean one as deﬁnite as Mrs. Parry or
Vvilbur D. Clark has. At least I do
not intend to write about the little
slate-colored sparrow that ﬂits and
chirps at my morning window. ‘We
have an energetic cat that seems to
gobble up all the poetry from my life.

You ‘see, I might be able to get
along chattering very pleasantly
about nothing in particular, adding
variety with words or phrases in cap-
ital letters, but vanity jabs me to
higher things. I want to discuss from
time to time current economic, po-
litical, and social problems. Here,
however, is the rub. Like Will
Rogers nearly all I know about the
world today is what I read in the pa-
pers. And I have come to the un-
happy conclusion that the papers have
a habit of telling you everything
about important matters except what
you want to know. I could follow the
example of the average college com-
mentator by digesting the Nation, the
New Republic, Harpers, and the other
sophisticated interpreters and then
rehashing their stuff in my own pecu-
liar lingo. The ten or ﬁfteen students
who read my stuff and only skimmed
through those magazines would pos-
sibly say, “Bright child.” On the
other hand, if a professor happened
upon the article by chance he would
undoubtedly give a Mona Lisa smile.

This column won’t do me much
good unless I can believe that I am
presenting the results of my own
thinking and not somebody else’s.
And nobody can tell me that he can
write an intelligent column on the
strike situation or the new movie
censorship after reading three or four
articles and chewing his Phncil or a
package of Five Brothers for half an
hour. Nine out of ten national prob-
lems are entirely too complex to un-
ravel in a day—especially when you
haven't even reached the hour when
your father clamps his hand on your
shoulder and solemnly utters the sig-
niﬁcant words, “You’re a man, my
son.”

Nevertheless, there will be columns,
I warn you, in which I shall timidly
comment on the same subjects that
‘Walter Lippman, The American Lib-
erty League, and Colonel McCormick
discuss. But be prepared for plenty
of qualifying adjectives and adverbs

PINGr—PONGr TABLE

i As You Like It 

By Raymond Pearlman

Freshmen: As soon as gvou, my
freshman readers, chance upon this
column, you will undoubtedly make
the nearest waste basket 21 present of
it. I do not blame you in the least,
for I recall how I, too, was unwilling
to read :2. column of this type

However, it is not my purpose to bore
you with any roaring platitudes, nor
to reiterate the prosaic admonitions
which you by now have heard ad
nauseam. I leave that to Florence
Fisher Parry; and I refer you for
sane advice to the essay, “From
School to College," by Le Baron Rus-
sell Briggs.

There is something, on the other
hand, I must impart to you—some-
thing I myself should like to have
read a few years ago. It is by no

means novel, and it you wish, you
may take it with a grain of salt:

There is one sad feature about col-
legiate activities which I believe not
negligible. In the potpourri of college
football, dances, fraternities and all
of the countless numbers of activities
which harass you curious freslnnen,
there exists a tendency to neglect the
most integral element which makes
such things go round. And that element
is you, yourself! I would not oppose in-
scribing Socrates’ “Know Thyself” on
the portals of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, no more than did the Greeks
over the doorway at Delphi. “He is a
fool that will forget himself.”

Know for certainty who you are
and what you want to get out of col-
lege. There are too many students
who squander four years, merely be-
cause of the lack of self-realization.
Self-realization should be the ideal of
every one of you. Vvhether you strive
to be the drug store sheik at Yohe’s,
or whether nocturnal lucubrations in
a garret on Craig street entice you,
whether your ideal is to read Statius
and Lucan in the originals, whether
your aim is to ﬁnd a mate, or whether
you are one of the many ones who
are striving to write the philosophy
of the twentieth century—whatever
your ideal may be, be dogmatically
certain that you will achieve it as far
as your talent allows, and that it will
germinate in the four years of your
college experience,

The next four years should be a
period of development, culminating in
self-expression. It should be a time
for intellectual progression. And don’t
be bashful. Give thought at least half
a chance to sear your forehead with
its lines.

Policy, Program
For This Season

—_-1

Announces Freshman Reception
Will Take Place In October;
Dance Dates Set

 

At the annual fall conference of
Panhellenic council last Friday in
Heinz House the year’s policies and
program were discussed with the
president and the two representatives
of each women’s fraternity. During
the morning session, Muriel Dils,
Ed35, president, welcomed the group
and asked for their cooperation in
making the coming year the best in
the council's existence_ The associate
members were acquainted with the
functions of Panheilenic by Lois
Ivlilliken, C35, vice president, who
also reported on the major achieve-
ments of the University chapter from
the viewpoint of the Urban Panhel-
lenic association. Louise McKirdy,
C36, secretary, discussed the Pan-
hellenic reports, which each repre-

sentative takes from the council meet-
ings to her fraternity.

Miss Helen Rush, assistant dean of
women, and the representative and
secretary of the faculty women's fra-
ternity committee, presented the
University’s viewpoint on the Pan-
hellenic council. The committee be-
lives that it is the duty of council
to ﬁt fraternity life into the whole
of University life.

Following lu11ch there was a busi-
ness meeting in which the standing
committees gave reports on their
planned programs for the coming
year. Lois Milliken_. social chairman,
announced these events: October 17,
the freshman reception; 19, an in-
formal open dance; November 26, a
tea dance for transfers in conjunction
with the YWCIA; December 17:, a
Christmas party and sing; March 8,
a pledge luncheon; May 14, annual
banquet; April 5, ball; April 11 and
12, convention; May 9, banquet for
new council members. The social
committee is composed of Martha
Green, C35, Rose Mary Kraeling, C35,
Ada Bella, Ed36, and Marion Messcr,
Ed37.

The freshman education committee,
headed by Margaret Chalmers, C36,
and including Alice O’Rourke, Ed35,
and Dorothy Benson, Ed36, plans to
foster interfraternity spirit and good-
will by a wide program of Panhel-
lenic education. The committee also
prepares the fraternity material used
by senior mentors.

Mildred Schuh, C35, chairman of the
conference committee, which is com-
posed of Grace Grobe, Ed35, Betty
Kelly, C37, Jean Lawson, C37, and
Marcella Layton, C37, reported on the
committee's work, which includes ed-
ucation of new council members, keep-

Pitt Men Participate
In Chemistry Meeting

 

At the eighty-eighth convention of
the American Chemical society, which
took place in Cleveland, Ohio, Sep-
tember 10-14, over two per cent of
the authors of papers presented were
members of the chemistry faculty of
the University or graduates of that
department.

Fifty-three alumni and faculty mem-
bers of the chemistry department and
Fellows of the Mellon Institute of
Industrial Research met for a
luncheon, which took place last Wed-
nesday in the Terminus club. Dr. E.
R. Vveidlein spoke about the new
Mellon Institute and stressed the im-
portance of the industrial research de-
velopments of the Institute. Dr. Alex-
ander Silverman discussed progress
in the chemistry department and
mentioned the fact that at no time
during the -depression were there
more than ten per cent of the chem-
istry graduates out of employment.

A similar reunion luncheon will be
scheduled for the spring convention
of the American Chemical society in
New York City.

University Women Get Handbooks
With Issuance Of Vade Mecum

A
V

 

No more will the women of the;

University have to bribe the men for
their YMCA freshman handbooks.
Varie Mecum, women's handbook, pub-
lished by the women's oiganization,
brings .the 900 full-time women stu-
dents their own.

For years the women have been
clamoring for a calendar with space
enough to scribble down dates for
meetings, dances, luncheon engage-
ments, conferences and tests. Forty
pages -of the handbook are devoted to
this -date schedule.

A part of the book has been set
aside as a freshman section. In this
section freshman women are informal-
ly oriented into women’s activities
at the University. The methods and
attitudes of women's organizations are
explained. A novel feature of this sec-
tion is the friendly, expository letter
which Panhellenic association extends
to freshman women. This letter of-
fers clues to freshmen on how to act
and what to say when approached by
a fraternity woman.

Panhellenic, WAA, YWCA, WSGA,
Woinen’s Choral nd the Women’s
Debating associatio combined to pub-
lish the book. Each organization ex-
plains the aims, purpose and activ-
ities of its particular group.

Traditions of the University from
Lantern Night to Senior Coronation
ceremony are described,

The book is bound with a durable.

leather cover._ All women ‘will _re-
ceive the publication at registration.

The editorial staff of the handbook
was composed of: Helen Rose Gib-
son, C36, editor; Leah Stark, C36, as-
sistant editor; Florence King, C35;
Charlotte Atwell, C37; and Dorothy
Miller, Ed36.

 

Hold Rites

Introduce Women Of 1938
To University Customs
With Fete Tonight

 

 

Lantern Night, the introduction of
freshman women to University life
and customs, will be observed on Wed-
nesday evening, September 26, accord-
ing to plans being made by the tradi-
tions committee of WSGA.

As in former years, the colorful
pageant will be held on the lawn by
the side of Thaw hall and will be
enacted by members of Senior court
and ofﬁcers of WSGA.

Following the traditional ritual, to
be attended this year only by fresh-
men, and their Senior mentors, each
woman will light her lantern and join
a procession winding up the steps.
At the Heinz House, the evening will
reach its climax in a ceremony par-
ticipated in by all women present.

Anna June Elmer, chairman of the
traditions committee of WSGA, will
be in charge of the program.

 

Pant-her’s Freshman
Number To Go On
Sale Monday

 

With articles ranging anywhere
from .a “Fraternity Forum” to “Love-
Making Made Easy,” and with inter-
views ranging from subjects such as
Chic Sale to subjects such as a stork.
the first issue of the Pitt Panther
will come out on campus Monday.

Appropriately enough, the number
will be labeled as the Freshman issue
and will contain many features and
helpful hints designed especially for
freshmen. Intimate glimpses of cam-
pus activity readers will be prominent
in this section.

This year's Panther will be consid-
erably different in style and material
from previous editions and will con-
tain four more pages than it did last
year, according to Charles Ruch, C36,
editor of the humorous magazine.

 

Faculty Announcements

Will Appear In Pitt News

 

Faculty announcements, containing
notices of interest especially to mem-
bers of the University teaching and
administrative staff, will appear reg-
ularly this year in The Pitt News.

standing head and will be found in
relatively the same position in each
issue of the News. Faculty announce-
ments will begin with the next issue,
Monday, September 24,

Items must be sent to William Mor-
rell or Miss Alena Horner in the Uni-
versity Editor's ofﬁce and not to the
editor of The Pitt News, and copy for
such announcements must be in the
University Editor's ofiice by noon on
the day before publication. Another
requirement imposed by the Univer-
sity Editor governing Faculty an-
nouncements is that all announce-
ments must be submitted in writing;

’ no notices will be taken over the tele-

phone.

Transfer Tea

Mentors, New Students
Will Be Entertained
By Heinz House

Transfer women will begin a pro-
gram designed to acquaint them with
the University by attending a tea at

Heinz House, Monday, at 3:30 o’clock,

be introduced to their mentors. The
mentors are senior women whose duty
it will be to act as advisers and guides
to the transfers assigned them,

Last year a series of weekly
luncheons sponsored by the various
women’s organizations on campus con-
stituted the orientation program.
Whether or not a similar plan will
be followed this year is yet to be de-
cided.

tions for either student part-
time work or FERA work prior

student can be assigned to FERA
work until he has complied with
these two requests.

Freshmen To Meet Coaches
At Annual Men’s Athletic
Assembly This Afternoon

The second annual athletic assembly, a genuine “know your
coaches” al'I"air, will take place this afternoon in Meinoi'ial hall at 1
o’clock with \V. Don Harrison, director of athletics, presiding.
Harrison is conducting the assembly primarily to give every fresh-
man an opportunity to meet the athletic coaches of the University.
The coaches will do their best to convince freshmen that there is a

 

place for them in Pitt athletics.

M 1'.

\Vith ten varsity sports on the

athletic program:
ball, swimming, track,
cross-country, riﬂe, wrestling and
boxing besides freshman competition
in all these sports with the excep-
tion of golf, the athletic officials hope
to double the percentage of students
now competing in University ath-
letics.

Following a short informal talk by
Mr. Harrison, students will be given
an opportunity to meet the coach of
the sport in which they are most in-
terested. Although the student has
had no previous experience in ath-
letics the coaches will be anxious to
attract his interest and will devote
as much time as possible to funda-
mental instructions for his beneﬁt.

The football players will meet
“Skip” Gougler, head freshman coach,
and Ralph Daugherty, center coach.
Dr. H. C. Carlson, varsity basketball
coach, and Dr. George Kowallis, fresh-
man basketball coach, will be glad to
receive any basketball candidate who
cares to step up and say hello.

Men who are track-minded will be
sure of a hearty welcome from Carl
Olson, coach of the track and cross-
country teams. Jack Schricker, newly
appointed boxing coach, will be will-
ing to enlighten freshmen interested
in that sport. Swimming coach, Pat
Corr, will be on hand to meet pros-
pective swimming candidates. Dr.
David O’Loughlin, tennis coach, will
interview tennis enthusiasts. Assistant
rrestling coach, Bradford Ilsley, will
greet the students interested in
wrestling. Head wrestling coach, Dr.
John Sutherland, will not be present,
since his duties at Camp Hamilton
keep him too busy. The future Bobby
Joneses will be received by Regis
VVolff, varsity golf coach. Lieutenant

'Kleininan, recently appointed to the

military department, is taking over
the riﬂe coaching reins.

150-Pound Stars
Get Grid Chance

Hogan And. Meredith To Coach
Lightweight Footballers

 

 

_VVhistle! Kick off! Signals! A
light snappy Panther "football team
falls into formation; the ball is

snapped; 127 pounds of halfback tears
into the line. He is playing football
for Pitt, and what's more his 127
pounds is no extreme handicap, for
he is playing on the ﬁrst 150—pound
football team in Pitt’s athletic his-
tory. The old story, “I never had a
chance to play football at Pitt; I
weighed only 145 pounds soaking wet,”
is out. The athletic department spoiled
that one by sponsoring a team for
students who weigh less than 150
pounds,

This year the project will be en-
tirely experimental. However, if
enough interest is shown in the
game, the athletic department will
make it a permanent branch in the
_SD01't program. There will certainly
be enough candidates to form at
least ﬁve teams if all the boys who
maintain thajt they never had a
chance report for the squad. Should
the sport arouse sufﬁcient interest,
games will be arranged with other
teams in the 150-pound class.

Bob Hogan and John Meredith,
quarterback and tackle respectively,
on last year’s varsity football team,
will coach the squad.

 

Seidle Explains
Rushing Orders

made by the students to protect, ﬁrst,
the interest of the freshman in en-
abling him to make an intelligent
choice of a fraternity, and, second,
to give the fraternity an opportunity
to choose the new students whom
they wish to rush. It is an arrange-
inciit of mutual beneﬁt which as such
should be carefully observed by all
men on the campus.”

“If you have any problems or ques-
tions, no matter how trivial they may
seem on the surface, I hope you will
come in to see me for help in work-
ing them out.”

Thus Mr. Seidle, greeted all under-
graduate men this week. He will act
as adviser to fraternities, replacing
Theodore A. Biddle, recently chosen
as graduate manager of student activ-
ities,

While an undergraduate, the new
assistant to the dean was prominent
on the campus as a member of ODK,
Sigma Tau, Scabbard and Blade, as
technical manager of Pitt Players, fra-

ternity editor of the Owl, and as a-

member of a number of social com-
niittees.

Nichols Predicts Static
U. 5. Population By 1940

 

 

The prediction that America’s pop-
ulation will become static by the
year 1940 was made last week by
Bervard Nichols, speaking before the
Wholesaler’s and Retailer’s councils
of the Chamber of Commerce. As a
result, said Mr. Nichols, who is editor
of. the Pittsburgh Business Review,
published monthly by the Bureau of
Business Research, the chief problem
of industry will be the supplying of
replacement products rather than the
discovery of new markets,

freslinicn of Pitt.

So confident is Mr. Olson in his be-
lief that any boy who is sound of
limb and free from heart trouble can
become a varsity letter-winner by
conscientious practice, that he and his
associates will sponsor the third an-
nual Fall track and ﬁeld games on

teams. All those who have earned[
either letters or numerals are deﬁ-
nitely barred from the competition.
Gold and bronze medals will be award-
ed the winners.

While the opening date of the meet
is exactly four weeks away, Olson
urges all those who are interested to
ﬁll out the adjacent entry blank im-
mediately and to report to the sta-
dium for equipment with which to
begin training, The main purpose of
the meet is to allow Olson to get
a line on what track material he may
count upon for the coming indoor sea-
son. All students carrying 12 or more
hours per semester are eligible for
the competition.

In addition to the call for the all-
University meet, Olson has requested
that all men interested in varsity and
lreshniaii cross-country participatioii
report to him at the Stadium any aft-
ernoon after 2:30. Those who report

 

immediately will likely get into better
condition and consequently will have
a head start on later arrivals.

Powell For Pitt

-—Coast’s Ranking Rooter
For 1 9 3 4 Panthers
Says “Thank You”

 

 

The Cathedral of Learning is Pitts-
burgh’s trade mark from coast to
coast, according to Dick Powell, the
local boy, who made good from coast
to coast. In town last week for one
of his infrequent visits, Dick was
rooting loudly for Pitt’s eleven to
triumph over Southern California. It
seems that out in Hollywood they’re
still razzing him about the last west-

ern trip the football lads made. Dick
is still the same, is still greeting his

‘audiences with the old familiar,

“Thank you very, very ki11dly;” is
still singing songs the old Powell
way, is still trying to dance grace-
fully,

As for the value of a college ed-
ucation in the show business, Dick
says that he would like to have ﬁn-
ishcd his proposed courses at the
University of Arkzmsas, but marriage
intervened.

His work in the movies has kept
him busy with almost continuous re-
liearsals; his favorite picture so far
has been “Twenty Million Sweet-
hearts.” He requests that Pitt stu-
dents write and tell him the type of
picture they most enjoy and would
most like to see. And, “Thank you
very, very kindly.”

Panther Football Team Faces
Nation ’s Outstanding Squads

 

By Jimmy Nelson

V-V'a.shington and J eiferson, \Vest Virginia, Southern California,
Minnesota, VVestminster, Notre Dame, Nebraska, Navy, and Carnegie
Tech—a long tough row to hoe for the 1934 Panther football team.
Losing eight regulars from last year’s team isn’t making the task
any easier for Dr. Sutherland and his staff of assistants. VV'hen you
lose that many men you don ’t ﬁll in the vacancies, you start from
scratch and build all over again, and that’s just what has been

Carideo Checks E
Classy Clothes

By Charles A. Ruch

For a long time now there has been
a pretty little saying that clothes
make the man. Out west, at the Uni-
versity of Missouri, it seems that our
old friend, Frank Carideo, has devel-
oped a. new slant on the saying. His
idea is that clothes break the football
player. In accordance with his new
idea, the one-time Notre Dame super-
quarterback and now coach of the
Missourians l1a.s declared that the
boys shall wear neither vests nor
neckties at school, VVhat the well-
dressed football player will wear at
St. Louis will be a pair of corduroy
slacks and a shirt open at the throat.

There’s no telling what this may
lead to. If the boys from Missouri
start dropping their opponents in a
very decisive fashion, the idea might
spread. Those pants may get a little
warm down south in Georgia Tech
and Alabama way, but then it seems
as if they wouldn’t mind a little dis-
comfort if they could win a few ball
games. The same situation applies
out in sunny California. Harvard,
Princeton, and Yale might ﬁnd such
an arrangement a little out of order,
and we’ll likely see an agreement be-
tween those schools to the effect that
the football lads must wear three-
piece suits, neckties, and a plain blue
or a plaid scarf. The Army and Navy
will simply have one terrible time of
it, unless they make the boys stick
to their fatigue outﬁts.

On the other hand, Mr. Carideo’s
teams may keep right on losing. Then
we may expect anything. In a couple
of years the Missouri boys ought to
be down to burlap and carrying
around large clubs. This would cer-
tainly offer a natty effect at afternoon
tea dances and would set the town
wild when the Missouri U. boys go up
to play the University of Chicago.
For Carideo’s own sake and for the
sake of the suit and pants manufac-
turers in St. Louis, we’ll hope that
Frank's outﬁt doesn’t lose many
games this year.

At any rate, coaches and suit-mak-
ers all over the country will keep a
watchful eye on Coach Carideo’s dis-
closures, especially the suit makers.

A terrible pun like the one in the
second sentence above this is pretty
bad to have preceding a survey of
what the well-dressed Panther will
wear when he steps out on the grid-
iron this fall. This news ought to
help you forget the pun. For the ﬁrst,
time in, let us say, history, the Pan-
thers will have white jerseys. Blue
stripes around the arms and huge
blue numbers on the back will be the
only marks of color on the white.
Pants this year will be of airplane
cloth, a very light but durable ma-
terial, and will be the conventional
khaki color with blue stripes up the
back. Headgears will be of solid
blue. As an alternative, the Panthers
may blossom forth in navy blue jer-
seys with the trimming and numbers
in gold.

More than describing the colorful
appearance which Pitt’s gridders will
present on the ﬁeld, it is interesting
to note that when the Panthers get

out there in the Stadium with South-

ern California's Trojans and the
Irish of Notre Dame, those who set
the styles in football fashions may
get a rare treat. Notre Dame, with
all-green jerseys and gold silk pants
has long been recognized as perhaps

the best-dressed team in the country..

Southern California, whose stock in
jerseys ran to white before that fatal
day in Los Angeles when Notre Dame
handed the Trojans a crushing de-
feat, now uses a dark blue jersey
which looks quite classy. Let’s all
hope it won’t rain on those two Sat-
urdays.

on at the Panther training¢

the Tech team down Duquesne earlier
in the season, the Panthers will meet
a plenty tough Kiltie team when they
make their bid _for the city champion-
ship against the Tartans in the Sta-
dium on November 29.

The Trojans had a bad season last
year, They lost one game and that
one game to Stanford, 13 to 7. A
team like the Trojans, that is quite
unaccustomed to losing a game
through the course of a season, will
be back to redeem themselves at the
expense of their opponents on this
year’s schedule, and need Ixremind
you that the Panthers head their list
of foes_

a veteran team with but one excep-
tion, Oen, the center. Minnesota has
been promised an undefeated season
by sport writers and the Big Ten
conference championship. Also,
Messers Lund and Alphonse will be
back to aid the Gophers’ scoring at-
tack.

VVestminster is a. well deserved
breather for the Pitt team, especially
so since it is the only one in a nine
game schedule. But the breather
will barely give the Panthers time to
catch their breath, for the following

Saturday they meet Notre Dame.
With Elmer Layden directing the
destinies of the Irish, the Pitt game
will be their main objective. The
process of pointing the Panthers for
the game with the Irish is a problem
in itself, for if Pitt is at its peak
when playing the Irish, there is likely
to be a slight let-down before they
meet Nebraska.

Against the Corn Huskers any sign
of a let-down‘ is likely to prove dis-
astrous to the Pitt cause. VVhat’s
more, the game will be played at Lin-
coln, and Nebraska is always a tough
team to beat in its own back yard.
It is only logical for the Middies to
point for Pitt after a 34 to 6 defeat
last season. When a team starts to
point a year in advance of the game,
as in the case of Navy, the opponent
is certain to be in for a long after-
noon.

After three strenuous games, Notre
Dame, Nebraska, and Navy comes
Carnegie Tech, and in the past the
Tartans have always been one of the
toughest teams on the Panther sched-
ule.

Vhile footballs have hardly begun
to ﬁy through the air, Dl'_ H_ Clifford
Carlson, Pitt basketball coach, is al-
ready laying plans for the cage sea-
son which will have the Panther
basketeers tossing basketballs on
courts from Wisconsin to Florida.

Carlson has set the opening (late of

have Skip Hughes and Claire Cribbs.
co-captains for the coming season, to
form the nucleus for his quintet, the
Panther coach and his assistant, Dr.
George Kowallis, will have something
of a job pic-king replacements for
Charley Hughes, Russ Ochsenhirt, and
Don Mccamant, all of whom have ﬁn-
ished their careers as Pitt ﬂoormen.

The Panther schedule will, call for
at least 23 games, with several other
engagements undergoing negotiations.
The big event of the year will be the
Florida trip, scheduled for Christmas
vacation. 

Freshman basketball will be under
the tutelage of William Kowallis, for-
mer Pitt noor star and brother of the
assistant yarsity coach. Prospects

look good for’ one of the ﬁnest year-
ling aggregations in Panther history.
