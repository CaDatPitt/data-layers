Minority ‘
enrollment
declining

By Diane Leﬂrowitz
The Pitt News

Chancellor Wesley Posvar met
with student leaders at a student
assembly meeting yesterday. to dis-
cuss the problems of decreasing
minority enrollment and defend
medical school management.

Student Government Board presi-
dentx Ken Stram and members
Robert Kramer, Betsy Fitzpatrick,
Avery Abrams, Pamela Hart_and
Dave Pikovsky attended the infor-
mal forum.

Black Action Society president

Daryl Davis was also present, as
were representatives from the Col-
lege of General Studies student
government, the Panhellenic Asso-
ciation and the Graduate and Pro-
fessional Student Organization.
_ “I think the number of admitted
black students should be much
higher," Posvar said. “One thing we
need to look at is the way we’re using
our funds. Are we admitting some
people who are very, very high risk
and maybe leaving out some people
who have a higher chance of
success?”

He admitted that because stu-
dents drop out, take time off or
retain part-time status, it is difficult
to know exactly how many black
students are enrolled at Pitt. He said
better methods of recruitment
should be developed.

“Our fundamental goal is to assess
the way we are deploying our resour-
ces for minority student retention
and recruitment," he said. “It‘s one
of our really serious problems."

He said schools should be encour-
aging blacks to be more involved in
fields like engineering, medicine and
the sciences, fields in which they
tend to be less active. The key to
doing this, he said, is to develop the

interest when the students are still in .

high school.

A small proportion of the black
students in Pittsburgh, as opposed
to other cities, take the Medical Col-
lege Admissions Test.

“It must have something to do
with the environment in their [high]
schools,” Posvar said.

Posvar also defended recent accu-
sations that the Pitt School of Medi-
cine has been poorly managed and
has had serious financial problems.

“The management of our medical
school is as good as any,” he said.
“All medical schools have...prob-
lems.”

Student Government Board
member Dave Pikovsky brought up
the subject ofextended library hours
during finals and midterms, a sub-
ject that has been ofongoing debate.

“This is an issue, that always goes
on year after year," Posvar said.
“The cost of keeping the library
open isn’t worth it for a handful of
students."

On Dec. 22, the Pennsylvania
Liquor Control Board (LCB) unex-
pectedly appeared on the doorsteps
of several local bars. It was not
Christmas spirit that brought the
inspectors, however. it was the
Christmas spirits being sold to
underage revelers.

“Nobody expected them to come
around during the holidays,” said a
Danny’s Pub doorman. “You would
think that since many ofthe students

had already gone home, the LCB
would slack off a little, but all of a
sudden, there they were.

‘‘I’m real strict about letting peo-
ple in without proper ID,” he said.
‘‘It’s a laugh with some of the things
people try to pull over you at the
door, but ever since I heard that l
can be arrested and brought down-
town if an underage person is caught
in the bar, I don’t let anyone in
unless they have ID."

Bob Berg, supervisor ofthe South
Western Pennsylvania LCB, said
that since Oakland and the sur-
rounding neighborhoods are full of
underage college students, there will

be a much higher rate of violations
served than
areas. “The bar owners [licensees]
have a tough battle in keeping out
the many underage students in the
area," Berg said.

“With such a high enrollment at
Pitt, let alone the smaller surround-
ing colleges, the situation becomes
much like that of a state college ~
since there are so many students to
regulate, it becomes a very difficult
job to keep them away from the
bars."

Berg said that they have no set
inspection periods for the bars, but
they usually answer complaints that

Bullman ends I0-year stint

Women’s AD leaves post

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Although administrators in the
Pitt athletic department fail to con-
firm it, the associate athletic director
for women’s sports is no longer serv-
ing in that capacity.

Sandra J. Bullman, in her l0th
year as overseer of six varsity pro-
grams, either resigned or was fired
for “not performing up to job crite-
ria," according to one Pitt coach.

Athletic director Edward Bozik
refused to comment on Bullman’s
leaving. It is believed the decision on
her status was finalized sometime
last week. '

“The only comment I’ll make is
that I’m not at liberty to talk about
personnel in this department or at
the university,” Bozik said late yes-
terday. “We consider those matters
personal in nature."

When contacted yesterday, Bull-
man asked that any questions con-
cerning her position be referred to
Bozik. Pitt women’s swimming
coach David Belowich, however, did
confirm Bullman's leaving the
athletic department but did not
question the motives behind it.

“She told me last Friday [Jan. 13]
I think," Belowich said earlier. “No,
maybe it was sometime last week
when I talked to her about it. I’m not
sure of the reasons. I think some
people decided she was not perform-
ing up to the job's criteria.

“She said she was no longer going
to be here."

Bullman first came to the Pitt
campus 20 years ago after a three-
year coaching and teaching stint at
Slippery Rock University and con-
tinued her instruction in physical
education majors. Bullman also
coached basketball, volleyball and
field hockey.

During her last season as coach,
she led an undefeated basketball
team in I973-74. Subsequent to that,
Bullman was appointed women‘s
assistant director of athletics.

The current women's basketball
coach, Judy Saurer, had nothing to
say about Bullman’s leaving except,
“It's a matter of personnel. I really
don't have a comment."

With the exit of Bullman comes a
heightened concern on the part of
Belowich. The third—year coach,
afterestablishing what he called a
“professional relationship” with her,
is unsure of what this latest action
means.

“The obvious concern is who‘s
going to replace her and where do we
go from here,” Belowich said. “I
have no jurisdiction; I’m under her
auspicies. I have my program. It's
very critical who replaces her.”

Belowich, who has had his reser-
vations about Bullman‘s capabili-
ties, said he remains unconvinced
she performed adequately.

“I want to give people the benefit
of the doubt, but I’m not sure she’s
been able to do more than she’s
done," he continued. “I don’t have
facts or figures in front of me on
scholarships, travel money, food
money and so on.

“There have been situations where
there have been some doubts that to
what I’ve been told is reality. I've
accepted [the answers], but that
doesn’t mean I like them.”

It is Belowich who believes that
his squad, in addition to squads
from other non-revenue sports, con-
tinues to be extremely competitive,
but at the expense of fewer dollars
per athlete each passing year.

“When recruiting, which is our
bread and butter, we have that
reputation..."

Belowich also thinks that Bull-
man lost a certain amount of respect
from others around and above her.

This receptivity, though, atilicts
most administrators in non-revenue
spams, Belowich added.

Io get “more arguments pres-
ented in a different light than in the
past,” Belowich acknowledged the
need for more liaisons between the
athletic department and the univer-
sity administration.

“Reputations precede some peo-
ple," he‘ said, “and decisions are

made without regard to those peo-V

p1e’s voices. Dr. Bozik is a classic
example. He brought credibility that
can be lost at the bottom ofthe hill.
Bozik could go in and talk to [Vice
Chancellor Jack] Freeman or
[Chancellor Wesley] Posvar.

“He’s coming from a credible
position. We never had that under
Cas [former athletic director
Casimir Myslinski].”

Belowich added, “I think Sandy,
somewhere along the line, lost that
credibility. That hurts us overall.
While she’s had excellent ideas and
ones that are beneficial, they were
not received by people making deci-
sions that perhaps may have
occurred otherwise.”

These are decisions that revolve
around money —— and lots of it.
Belowich said that that which is gen-
erated by the nationally—recognized
football team and the emerging bas-
ketball program are more than
welcome.

It is the recognition of these two
money-makers that Belowich said
he believes is not being exploited
enough,

“There’s a lot we can do as a
department that we could do a better
job in the community at large to help
out everybody," he said. “We need
the coordination of people who go
out and start talking about it. We

need spokespersons, people making 3

contacts — a point person.”

Med student honored after death

B N P Id

Monday night, the Allegheny
County Medical Society presented a
posthumous Medical Student
Award to a Pitt student for his out-
standing example of how to die.

James Sheehan transferred to
Pitt‘s medical school after one year
at the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine. He returned to
his home in Pittsburgh because
father’s health was not good and
also because he wanted to be with his
friends.

“Jamie" did exceedingly well in
his junior year at Pitt, Dr. Francis
Drew, associate dean for student
affairs, said. And that April, doctors
removed a large tumor from his
abdomen.

Pitt‘s department of medicine sent
Jamie to the National Institute of
Health in Washington, [).C.. where
he could get chemothrapy
treatments.

Jamie soon came back to Pitts-
burgh for the rest of his medicalcare
and to be with his close friends and
family. Being close to the people that
he cared about was one of Jamie's
priorities, even before he became

PennRlSE
prospers

By Molly Brown

I For The Pitt News

The Universityof Pittsburgh
and three other Pennsylvania
universities have created a com-
puterized information system
that enables area businesses and
industries to gain access to uni-
versity resources.

The service is called Penn-
RISE,— The Pennsylvania Reg-
ister of International Skills and
Expertise. The register is a direc-
tory of faculty experts and their
backgrounds in international
affairs. It includes the experts‘
specialties, foreign language
background, overseas expe-
rience and academic and
research work.

Jonathan Flint, director of
PennRlSE at Pitt, said. “The
concept was introduced by Gov.
Thornburgh in an attempt to
make Pennsylvania businesses
more international."

With businesses and universi-
ties working together,the univer-
sities’ vast resources can be made
available to businesses wishing
to expand into the international
arena.

The information is obtained
by a questionnaire given to Pitt
faculty and staff members. Over
600 have already responded. and
Flint hopes to expand even
further.

The individual information is
then put into a database. A
notice announcing the service
was sent to approximately 8,000
businesses in the Pittsburgh area.
Over I00 requests for informa-
tion have been returned to Pitt,
said Flint, who is also director of
public service programs at Pitt's
Center for International Studies.

He said most seek informa-
tion relating to either specific leg-
islation about US. exporting or
general questions about the
country’s business climate. Busi-
ness practices and customs are
also important. requiring infor-
mation about the culture and
language.

If a request cannot be fulfilled
by one university, it can be
tapped from either the Univer-
sity of. Pennsylvania, Temple
University or Penn State Univer-
sity, which are also involved in

sick, Janice Anderson. 'Jamie’s class-
mate and friend, said.

“Jamie liked people and was very
aware of their needs," she said. He
believed that doctor—patient com-
munication was very important.
Because of this, Jamie‘s patients
really liked him.

Jamie also enjoyed close com-
munication with his friends. Even
before he became sick, Jamie talked
to Anderson about his very strong
spiritual beliefs. He believed that life
on earth was only one type of exist-
ence, and that after death, there is
another level of existence in another
time and place, she explained.

As he was watching his physical‘
being dwindle with his disease, his

spiritual self expanded. It was Jam-
ie’s acceptance of this that helped
Anderson and the others who were
close to him.

last summer, Jamie married Pat
Downey. They designed their wed-
ding ceremony and wrote their
vows.

In September, Jamie, his wife,
Anderson and another friend went
to Key West, Fla, for a week. The
trip was very significant, Mrs. Shee-
han said. Jamie became increasingly
weak. He felt his physical body leav-
ing him, but his spiritual sense pro-
vided him with the ability to deal
with it. The week drew them all very

‘ close.

In October, the medical school
gave Jamie his diploma, before the
rest of hisvclass would graduate. Two
weeks later, Nov. 7, Jamie died.

The award given in Jamie’s honor
two nights ago was one of four
awards given to outstanding medical
students. Drew nominated Jamie for
the award, which has been given
primarily to athletes in the past.

“He wouldn’t have been given this
if he had lived,” Mrs. Sheehan said.
“Through his death. people had an
opportunity to get to know him."

Mrs. Sheehan accepted the award
for Jamie at the society‘s annual

Students have rights...

When university students leave their parents’ homes and
move into the dorms for their first day of school, they begin a
maturation process that will forever change their lives. One
hopes that as responsible young adults, the students will learn
to eventually take care of themselves and gain a greater respect
for their fellow men.

The personal development that comes with leaving home.

and living in one’s own care is an integral part of the university
learning process. The present Pitt dorm policy restricting stu-
dents from having guests in the dorm rooms after 2 a.m. treats
resident students as immature children, unable to take care of
themselves — as if they need babysitters.

This is an insult to the entire resident population and the
student body. Ifthe university administration holds this view of
resident students, what do they think separates the levels of
responsibility between residents and students who live off cam-
pus? '

It took a long time and hard struggles to get schools in
America to rethink their archaic residential policies and give
the much-deserved trust to the studentsthey admit to universi-
ties. In the recent years of discomforting conservatism, Pitt
administrators should not withhold that trusting relationship
from the students. »

It is an embarrassing comment on our society when its
universities will boast of their students’ achievements and
speak of a united university while not trusting the students with
the responsibility to decide when they should end their evening
conversations. All this policy does is drive the wedge between
the student and administration deeper’.

The students of the university are a microcosm of our
society. Th_e majority of Pitt students are mature enough and
responsible enough to be treated with the same rights as any
adult. This university ruling is long overdue for change. It, is
about time that the university stops living in fear of its student
body and works with the students to improve the quality ofthe
residential, educational and administrative environments at
Pitt.

and responsibilities

Twelve million dollars and one and a half years later, the
William Pitt Union stands as a shining testament to the pride of
the university. Or does it? .

There’s no question that the new union is a beautiful building

' or that its new interior is far superior to the old. But the union

has been struck with a horrible plague that is ravaging so many
of the university’s buildings. The place is beginning to look like
a pigsty, and the responsibility for this lies primarily with a
handful of students. .

It is so terribly disheartening and contradictory to ‘hear the
endless drone of Pitt students moaning over tuition increases
and then see them leave food, garbage and failed exams all over
the union’s dining area. Later, a tuition-paid university
employee is going to waste his time and our money picking up
after these lazy and disrespectful people.

There is no greater insult to these visiting benefactors than to
force them, or ourselves, to eat in an unfit dining room or to
visit a bathroom strewn with revolting defecation that is so
disgusting and nauseating that common decency prohibits any
further description.

The student union —— and the whole school — should be
showplaces of our achievements, our maturity and our pride in
the university. Instead, there isn't a building on campus that
hasn’t been affected by this destructiveness. A _

The students who are destroying the university are friends
and_acquaintances of ours. It is clear that the majority of the
student body recognizes this vandalism as an intolerable indict-
ment against all Pitt students. Ifthe student body can’t appeal
to this unruly bunch, then, as in a “real"society, the law should
be brought to bear against them.

Letters To The Editor

Readers claim writers all wrong on Punk

1 can see it now! “The Scandal of
the Madness and Corruption in the
Message of Punk Music“ a.k.a.
“Punk: Music, Madness or Mes-
sage,” The Pitt News, Jan. ll, 1984,
by Richard Schnap and Diane
Lefkowitz.

Schnap, a senior English writing
major, who last term took a course
in journalistic writing, must have
been asleep in class much of the
time. For instance, journalistic
integrity entails not using the media
for personal gain. ln this case.
Schnapojust happens to be the lead
vocalist for the band Toxic Shock,
to which he repeatedly refers to in
the article.

While I am not necessarily accus-
ing The Pitt News of promoting his
group, I do question Schnap‘s inten-
tions in the selection ofthis particu-
lar group. There are many other
local bands of superior quality that
have been on the scene for a much
greater period of time and have a
better reputation than Toxic Shock,
such as The Five and the Imprints.

Schnap quotes a newcoming band
that most local “punks" consider to
be less than third rate and probably
not punk at all. Just mentioning
Toxic Shock in the same breath as
punk leads to a direct comparison as
absurd as calling Lawrence Welk a
pop orchestra leader.

Punk began as a direct rebellion
against the “peace, love, freedom
and happiness" movement of the
late '60s and early ‘70s. The econ-
omy. especially in England, had
taken a turn for the worse. Johnny
Punk's father got laid off, his mother
had to work full-time to support the
family and became an alcoholic, sis-
ter Susie became promiscuous, and
the whole premise of the peace era
was replaced be a sense of helpless-
ness and a feeling of “anti-anti."
People dressed to show discontent
and protested against everything.
This movement was delayed in its
entry into the United States because
of the pressing issue of the Vietnam
War. Punks became an outward
symbol of an internal rebellion,
much as long hair had started out to
do in the ’60s. In the early "705,
groups such as the Sex Pistols and
the Dead Kennedys began to make
the scene. i

Eventually, as with all move-
ments, punk becameco-opted by the
status quo of Hollywood and New
York, especially Madison Avenue.
Unlike the down-with-society, thrift
shop punks of earlier times, current
punks are intensely materialistic.

To purchase one stylish “punk"
outfit requires a sizeable cash outlay

— $l6 for a simple haircut, $30 fora A

loose fitting shirt, $35 for tight
pants, $9 for fishnet hose (remember
when a good pair cost only 89¢?) and
more for miscellaneous items,just to
look poorly dressed.

Even the formerly good bands,
such as the Police and Duran
Duran, have changed their styles to
suit the record companies and acne-
faced teenagers who buy their

T albums by the millions and emulate

the singers with intense fervor.

This leads me to my final objec-
tion to “Punk: Music, Madness’ or
Message" —— timeliness. Schnap, for
instance, was a Pitt student several
years ago when punk was new, and
he was very much involved in the
movement, hosting his own new
wave radio show on CMU's WRCT.

Why didn‘t this article appear
then, when the movement was some-
thing new, exciting and refreshingly
unique?

Nancy J. Weiner

I write in reply to the inconclusive,
uncertain tone of Richard
Schnapp’s and Diane Lefkowitz’s
article on punk in the Jan. I0 issue of
The Pitt News. My letter takes for
granted that there actually is some-
thing called punk and completely
ignores the supposed differences
between punk and new wave, which
arise from the misconception that
punk is only a kind of music.

When asked to define jazz, its
musicians always suspected that
anything said beyond the actual
music itself was inaccurate, or at
least superﬂuous. This is not the dif-
ficulty with defining punk.
Although the punks, the musicians
especially, are unwilling or find it
difficult to say what punk is, it is not,
as it seemed with jazz, as though
there were simply no room for a defi-
nition. Punk is a style; yet despite all
the hard work of the l960s, the term
“style" is still regarded as an insult.
Style is perceived as a king of sys-
tematic superficiality; the term
seems to imply affection, and a lack
of seriousness. This is unfortunate.
A few people, such a David Bowie, a
punk precursor, and Malcolm
McClaren, a punk entrepreneur,
have realized this. True style is an
artistic medium. Punk, whatever
else it may do, entertains. Nothing is
more serious than entertainment.

The first punks, whether the Sex
Pistols, or the New York Dolls, or
the Stooges or ? and the Mysterians,
played music. Punk music provided
the focal point for dress, politics,
iconography, makeup, behavior
and the other elements that came to
comprise the punk style. The aes-
thetic of punk, unlike that of jazz,
came to address more than ques-
tions of music. lt looked for its
expression in other artifacts and
came to embrace old television pro-
grams, the commercial art of the ﬁf-
ties and a wide range of post-war
hairstyles, skirts, and sunglasses. It
also looked for expression in the
artifacts of previous styles: Nazi
style, mod style, beat style. The punk
style drew from an array of iiiﬂu-
ences and eventually found itself
comfortable employing the imagery,
vocabulary, and artifacts from
nearly every ‘look’ or ‘scene’ since
I945. The tremendous difference in
sound between Black Flag and the
Cramps, two groups equally worthy
of the name punk, serves as an
example of the diversity of which
punk style has been capable. It is the
kind of diversity that an ‘attitude’ or
a ‘movement’ could never sustain.

A punk today ,may accurately
represent his or her exercises in style
with African music, futurist posters,
“The Jetsons," civil defense films or
by wearing the same hairstyle her
mother did in a prom picture from
I959. Punk has become, ﬁnally, a
style made of styles, a style about
style. Those punks who struggle to
find a suitable label or definition for
punk should feel quite satisfied with
this. lf being practitioners of style
makes them uncomfortable, then
not only do they ignore the impor-

tant roots punk has in the ’60s of

Andy Warhol, Peter Meaden and
Susan Sontag, they will never be
able to achieve in the art form they
have chosen.

The Pitt Ne_ws_, Wednesday, January l8, 1984

From the Foul Line/ Mark A. Sindler

Textbook cover-up, no party

The Pitt Book Center, ever a role
model of textbook-pricing conspira-
cies, will celebrate an anniversary
today that no one will commemo-
rate or remember. Those affected by
it would do well to treat the day as
any other since this is nothing to
throw parties for.

On Jan. l8, 1983, two employees
were informed that their services
would no longer be needed and were
formally fired from their bookstore
positions. The day stands as a mile-
stone, and proved to be the starting
point of a unionizing effort‘ that
eventually became swallowed up.

That's nothing to be celebrating
except that what followed the two
terminations might serve as an
example to those who seek similar
ventures.

Prior to Charles Delaney and Tim
Brady losing their jobs, a union
card-signing campaign was insti-
tuted at the bookstore. A silent but
strong minority ofemployees sensed
a need forprofessional affiliation, so
went about obtaining that by taking
the first step —— polling their fellow
workers.

Conjecture here says they did not
stand much ofa chance of unioniza-
tion. History has shown that unions
don’t make it at the bookstore. So it
wasn’t until three employees were
suspended and two others fired that
several workers realized the bomb-
shell they were sitting on.

They figured that if it could be
shown that the employees‘ firings
and suspensions involved could be
tied to their unionization attempts,
then all the more power to them.

Those directly involved in the
unionization effort know it, as prob-
ably do those who have been repres-
enting the employees, the Allegheny

Joint Regional Board. They know
what kind ‘of coverup they painted
and expected outsiders to be sympa-
thetic to their plight.

First there was talk of several
employees being dismissed and sus-
pended because of their support for
a future union establishment‘.
Employees were not satisfied with
grievance procedures. Poor condi-
tions —— in the receiving areas -—
included tolerating carbon'
monoxide fumes from delivery vehi-
cles and working with tabletops,
stacked with books, teetering on
cinder blocks.

Some even charged they were

"under management surveillance in

the workplace. Others seemed
uneasy about blue-collar workers --
some who upend wastebaskets --
earning four times that which cash
register" tellers pulled in. The
employees saw their work as impor-
tant and inﬂuential; they wanted
compensated accordingly.

Maybe one or two of these items
have substance to them. And if the
employees pursued conciliatory
action regarding these items, the
results would likely have rectified
their complaints.

The same could have been said for
this unionizing effort — if the
employees and their representatives
had gone about getting it the right
way. Instead of just chasing their
union cause, the AJRB had to mix in
the suspensions and dismissals.
When they knew that establishing a
union itself would not likely suc-
ceed, the prospects of the discipli-
nary actions became blue-chip
material.

During the spring the AJRB first
went before a state hearing examiner

to win back Delaney's and Brady‘s
lost wages and jobs. The AJRB lost
this once the examiner found the
two were fired for failing to heed
overtime schedules and cussing out
their immediate superivsors.

Later, in a hearing before the Pen-
nsylvania Labor Relations Board in
June, the AJRB brought its case
before another examiner to show
that Book Center director Mary
Bonach and her immediate “lieuten-
ants” purposely put up union-
busting fronts and thwarted union
activities there. Again, this examiner
found in favor of the university.

Even later, in an October gather-
ing with the PLRB, the AJRB

finally came around to presenting its
case for a union at the Book Center.
This was a hearing that should have
been petitioned for in January; by
now it was too late. The PLRB,
looking to avoid overfragmentation
of campus unions, shot down the
AJRB‘s latest plea.

The movement died. Of course,
the Book Center came out of this
“crisis” smelling like a rose. lt didn't
hurt to have the power ofthe Office
of Human Resources behind it.
Pitt's university counsel office
joined the effort, too. Andjust to be
sure that this state-funded school
didn‘t embarrass itself, it went out
and hired Pittsburgh’s largest law
firm, Reed Smith Shaw & McClay
—— with a specialty in labor affairs.

Obviously there were many
employees knowing that all could be
overcome and a union would even-
tually find a way into the bookstore.

But the pure dream was tainted by
shaky dreamers. The half-truths evi-
dent here ultimately led to the dem-
ise of a unified hope.

violent situations that the LCB tries
to avoid at all costs," he said. “In
many cases, the inspector will con-
tact the police for assistance or
return to the office to get an addi-
tional inspector."

According to ‘Berg, the violation
carries with it an administrative
penalty to the licensee as well as a
summary offense to the minor. The
licensee must answer to the LCB in
Harrisburg. at which time a fine may
be levied and a temporary suspen-
sion of his liquor license invoked.
The licensee has the right to appeal
the violation, however, and remain
open until the appeal is heard.

Last term, several violations were
served to the Oakland bars. The
Decade received a five-day liquor-
license suspension, the Keg is pres-
ently appealing a hearing that took
place sometime in September, and
Peters received a $600 fine.

“Although we have a very limited
enforcement staff,” Berg said, “we
can only do our best to see to it that
bars remain fairly bare of underage
drinkers." '

Fire alarm
rings in
Union

By Wendy Sharkey
The Pitt News

The series of false alarms at the
Student Union since the beginning
of January do not have a common
origin, said James Watters, assistant
director of the campus police.

The five alarms that have been set

_ off since the beginning of the term

were not the result of a malfunction
in the system itself, Watters said.

There are two types of alarm acti-
vations, according to Watters.

“On the one hand, the system is
working legitimately, and the work-
men in the area are not aware of the
location of the alarms. The fumes
that are produced while they are on
the job, get picked up by the detec-
tors and trigger the alarm," he said.

The workmen have to get accus-
tomed to where the alarms are
located so they can work in other
areas of the building, Watters said.

“The sensitivity of the alarms,
which is a mechanical difficulty.
needs to be worked out by the con-
tractors,“ he said.

The contractors have already
solved the initial problems in the sys-
tem, and there has not been an alarm
set off at the Student Union since
Jan. ll.

Although the students‘ welfare is
not in jeopardy if an alarm proves to
be false, the Pittsburgh Fire Depart-
ment is concerned about the evacua-
tion practices employed by some
students, fire captain Moe Esta said.

“We never know whether there is
a real fire or not when we respond to
a call, and neither do the students,"
he said. “We have to treat every
alarm seriously, and so should the
students.”

, Problems arise when there is a real
fire, particularly in the Student
Union building, where there are
many different activities going on
and where a large number of people
congregate. The students should
always exit the building quickly
when instructed and should not
assume that the alarm is false, Esta
said.

Thanks to you...

  Pitt ‘upsets’ St.John’s. in OT 63-61
.Pitt’s first

BE win

By Todd Erkel
The Pitt News
Head coach Roy Chipman

emerged from the Panther locker
room Monday night, tilted his smil-
ing face back and gave a short but
telling gasp ~- ‘‘sheewww" —- to
those gathered outside.

With that breath, Chipman blew
out a second half and an overtime
period full of missed shots, errant
passes and costly mistakes that
almost turned into the biggest disap-
pointment of the Panther’s early Big
East schedule.

But when Billy Culbertson
climbed upon St. John's freshman
Willie Glass and stole the ball with
three seconds left in overtime, the
disappointment turned to joy, and
the Panthers escaped with a 63-61
victory over the Redmen before a
sold-out and starving Fitzgerald
Field House crowd.

The tendency is to compare this
game with last year’s 72-71 win over
the Redmen, which delivered the
Panthers from obscurity, but the dif-
ference between the two games is as
simple as a point and a half.

Pitt, 9-4, 0-3 and sweeping the
basement of the Big East Confer-
ence, came into the contest as a
point-and-a-half favorite to beat St.
John’s 11-2 and ranked in the mp 20
nationally.

What must have looked like a sure
thing a fortnight ago to the Big
Apple’s chance-takers could be
heard crumbling to the floors of

Andre Williams kissed a fall-away

time period to give the Panthers the
lead to stay at 61-59.

“I prayed on that shot,” Williams
said. “Not that it was a lucky shot,
but I prayed."

“1 don‘t consider the game an

are at the point where beating good
teams at home shouldn‘t be a
surprise.”

Both teams played down the
stretch as if winning were the farth-

M est thing from their minds. Pitt, up

by six points with two minutes
remaining in regulation, allowed St.
Johns back in the game, and the
Redmen tied it at 55-55 on Mike
Moses’ 22-foot jump shot from the
top of the key. Neither team
bothered to score in the final two

Watkins plays unsung hero

By Charlie 0’Hara
The Pitt News

Chip Watkins stepped to the
foul line in Monday night’s Pitt-
St. John‘s contest with 1:54
remaining in overtime and his
team’s fortunes depending on his
accuracy.

Neither the Panthers nor the
6,586 crazed fans in attendance
could have been any more
relaxed. His poise at the line was
more indicative ofone enjoyinga
good book rather than that of
deciding what could be Pitt's
most pivotal game of the season‘:

He sank both shots to com-
plete an eight-for-eight evening
from the free-throw line.

“I thank the doctor for that,”
Watkins said of Dr. Jerry Ches-
siii, who has recently been called
on by Pitt for hypnotic treat-
ment. “The crowd was in the
game all the way, but at the foul
line, 1 keep my mind on the free
throws.”

Eight seconds remained in
overtime, and the junior from
Louisville, Ky., was to inbound
the ball from beneath the St.
John’s basket. The Panthers

“We beat St. Johns and Clyde didn’t even
score in the second half ”

—Chip Watkins

were leading by two and needed
to connect on the inbounds pass.

The Redmen had Pitt covered
like a blanket. The inbounds play
had to be completed within five
seconds or a time—out called
before four, so Watkins called
time—out. The referee didn't
acknowledge, although replays
proved that the call was made in
time.

Despite the errant judgment,
the Panthers went on to win 63-
61 in what coach Roy Chipman
did not consider an upset.

Watkins‘ ﬂawless foul shoot-
ing and court awareness in the
Panthers’ victory typified his
overall improvements through-
out this 1983-84 season.

“Chip is playing very well,”
Chipman said. “He's really
working hard on offense and
rebounding the ball. He’s always
played good defense.”

“Its been a mental thing for
me,” Watkins said of his relaxed
style of play. “As ajunior in high
school, 1 remember taking con-
trol my game. My first two years
here at Pitt were a lot like high
school.

“Now, We realized what 1
have to do. 1 play opposite of
Clyde [Vaughan], and I should
take full advantage of that.
Coach Chipman told me at the
beginning of the season that ifl
play hard defensively and
rebound aggressively that the
scoring will come."

Last season, Trent Johnson
mastered the “opposite of
Vaughan” position, but Watkins
has added a, leadership dimen-
sion to the role in this transition

. year.

“This is not a one—man team,”
said Watkins, who as a senior
was rated the second best player
in Kentucky as a senior at Doss
High. “We beat St. John’s

tonight, and Clyde didn't even
score in the second half. We’re all
playing to win. I felt we could
play inside with them from the
start. We‘re gonna throw our
bodies around if we have to."

Watkins is presently averaging
6.8 points per game, after 3.0 and
2.6 points per game as a fresh-
man and sophomore, respec-
tively. He’s also grabbing close to
six rebounds per outing.

Watkins’ most consistent
improvement since coming to
Pitt has come from the foul line.
After 57 percent shooting as a
freshman and 69 percent as a
sophomore, Watkins is up to 74
percent this season.

“He gives them good strength
inside," St. John's coach Lou
Carnesecca said of Watkins. “He
plays with great intensity. He’s
an excellent foul shooter; he
proved that down the stretch."

Chip Watkins has proven to
the Big East that Pitt has another
forward besides Vaughan.
Opponents are going to have to
defend him as intensely as they
do Vaughan, or they may suffer
consequences similar to those the
Redmen did on Monday night.

Panther wrestlers prepare for Cleveland State

By Tim Dinger
The Pitt News

The Panther wrestling team will
attempt to boost its record above
.500 by traveling to Cleveland State
to take on the Vikings in an Eastern
Wrestling League (EWL) match-up
tonight at 7:30 p.m.

The Panthers go into the match
3-3 overall and 1-1 in EWL contests,
while Cleveland enters at 4-2 overall
1-0 in the EWL. At last ranking,
Cleveland was 15th in the nation.

“It’s going to be one of the tough-
est.' matches we’ve had so far this
year," said assistant coach Chuck
Coryea, “but I still think that we can
go out there and do a good job
against them.”

For various reasons, the Panthers
will be sporting several changes in
the line-up, most notably at 134 lbs,
where senior co-captain Joe Throck-
morton (213-5) will miss action due
to sickness.

Replacing him will be sophomore
John Hnath.

Hnath returns to the mats after
illness forced him to miss most of
last season-in which he compiled a
4-2-1 record at 126 lbs.

Another major change will come
at 150 lbs., where sophomore Joe
Bond (12-10) will get a rest, being
replaced by either senior Dan Lecce
or junior Greg Dille. '

Despite the changes, Coryea
remains confident that Pitt can give
Cleveland a run for its money‘.

“We have enough depth that we

can be competitive with anybody,

regardless of who we put in," said
Coryea. “We’ve wrestled more

second-teamers this year than we

have in the past, so we're not sending
in people who have had no varsity
experience.”

At 134 lbs., the Vikings will coun-
ter the Panthers with junior Dave
Budnar (6-5), while at 150 lbs.,
Clemson transfer Steve Babyak (6-
2) will get the call for Cleveland.

At 118 lbs., freshman Hal Bolin
(2-1) of Pitt will battle Cleveland’s
John Velemesis (5-4).

At 126 lbs., Panther Kyle Nellis
(18-4) will get a strong fight from
C1eveland’s Dan Foldesy (12-5), the
defending EWL Champion and
three-time national qualifier.

At 142 lbs., Pitt‘s Gary Bolin(7-9)
takes on Viking Bob Richards (11-

Clvde Vaughan, after burning the
famed Redmen man—to—man defense
for IS first—half points, went one for
the final 25 minutes and missed
badly on crucial foul shots.

With their leading scorer skid-
ding. the rest of the Panther offense,
including an unearthed George
Allen. forced itself into maintaining

Dthe lead. Or as Chipman said,

persevering.

“Clyde is a time bomb, and maybe
that is a problem," Chipman said.
“It looked as if the kids who got us
there ~— Billy [Culberston], George
[Allen] and Andre [Williams] Aw got
tentative, and they all started look-
ing to go to Clyde.

“When you haven't had a lot of
big games, you become a little
tentative.”

Allen, who had been stagnating
benchside in his last three games,

‘,,shattered his shooting problems

with consecutive 20-foot plus
jumpers and a three-point play with
a left-handed layup that crested
somewhere above the scoreboard
level. -
“George was frothing at the
mouth to play, and we felt it was the
right time to go to him,” Chipman
said.

Allen agreed.

“I had a feeling that if the game
came down to the wire, I would get a
chance,” Allen said. “I just didn‘t

a‘ know how big of a chance.

“Everybody thinks New York is
the godfather of the league. Every-
body wants to beat the New York
team.”

Chipman also knew that his New
York City connection "Allen.
Vaughan and Williams  didn’t
want to go back home with their
collective tails between their legs.

“It‘sapridething,”Chiprnar1 said.

Staring at an 0-4 Big East record
seemed to remind the Panthers how
hard it was to swallow that pride last

‘season.
Panther Notes: Pitt freshman Curtis
Aiken finished the game with eight
assists in 20 minutes of play but
didn‘t score a point....Keith Arm-
strong didn‘t score, either....Clyde
Vaughan needs only 20 points to

McGuire probes NCAA

By Al McGuire
For The Pitt News

Sometimes the NCAA Rules
Committee reminds me of the story
my father used to tell about the
bouncer, back when l was a kid
tending bar in Rockaway Beach,
N.Y.

About every third week, if things
were quiet, the bouncer would start
a fight, just so the guy that owned
the place would think we needed
him. It's like that with the rules com-
mittee. Sometimes, it seems like they

change rules just for the sake of"

change.

l‘ve always,said, hey, if some-
things not broken, don’t fix it.
We’ve got it. We‘ve got a game that's
ﬂying high on two networks and
whatever cable or box office you
want to mention. Its got excitement,
thrills, roller coaster emotion, it
shimmers like the Jello when you
shake the dish.

So why change it?

This year, the rules committee
made two major changes and one
minor one. And then ended up res-
cinding one of the major ones, just
four weeks after the season started.

The three were the Jim Valvano
Rule, which was later rescinded, the
Patrick Ewing Rule, and the Al
McGuire Rule. The last two are
okay, but the Valvano Rule was
dead wrong from the start. A Dun-
kirk for college basketball, that I
had predicted wouldn't be around
for the opening of the 1984-85
season. i

I give the rules committee credit

for rectifying its mistake so quickly. ’

But the point is, it was a mortal sin to
adopt the rule in the first place.
The Valvano Rule called for two
free throws to be awarded for each
common foul committed within the
last two minutes of the second half
and entire overtime periods, if the
bonus rule was in effect. lt‘was an
over-reaction because last year, in

I North Carolina State’s Cardiac Run

to the National Championship,
Coach Valvano won six or seven
games by having his players inten-
tionally foul opposing teams that
were leading in the last two minutes,
figuring their players would miss the
front half of the one-and-one.

' The reason for this rule was to foil
that strategy and to take the pressure
off an official’s having to call an
intentional foul. But if the inten-
tional foul was such great strategy,
then the leading team would be
doing it too. And hey, it’s never been
easy to ref, but the rules commitee
shouldn’t be trying to do their job.
Basketball will always be ajudgment
call, a roller coaster, up-and-down
type sport where things happen in an
instant.

Plus, there’s something about that
young kid getting up there, having to
make the first shot ofa one-and-one
that puts goosebumps on your arms.
And officials‘ will always be the
enemy in hoops. It’s like the Chris-
tians and the lions: it never changes.

I think the rules committee should
meet only every second year. I
believe the Valvano episode shows
we’re tampering too quickly with
rule changes. Experiments should
run two years, and only in one
conference.

The Ewing Rule is that the T-shirt

vmust be the same color as the uni-

form and there will be no marking
on the T-shirt. It's called the Patrick
Ewing Rule because the last two
years Patrick Ewing wore a T-shirt
with a Nike emblem on the arm.
That’s a no-no, so the committee
passed the T-shirt Rule.

Lots of players have to wear T-
shirts because the material of the
uniform irritates their skin and
creates rashes. But the rule was
passed to stop the wearing of Nike.
It seems inconsistent, because all the
show companies have emblems on
their shoes, and if you carried it out
to the end, everybody would have to
play barefoot.

Also, we~have a serious problem
interviewing coaches because they’re
making like race drivers, who have
caps that say Goodyear and suits
that are walking marquees. Lots of
coaches now have a Converse or
Adidas or Puma T-shirt or sweat
jacket on. But that's a broadcasting
problem, nothing more.

What I'm saying is, I think the
insignificant Ewing Rule was right

because the pros were getting intoéﬂ
amateur sports by being on the mar-"

quee, that is, the player.

The McGuire Rule, I believe, will
stand the test of time. It‘s something
l’ve pushed for years, that in all
commercially—televised games, the
number oftimeouts be reduced from
five to three per team during a regu-
lation game.

See, in the past, the normal TV
game had 8 to l0 automatic com-
mercial timeouts on dead balls, usu-
ally occurring at l6, l2, 8 and 4
minutes remaining in each half. So
what the coaches would do is wait
for a commercial timeout, rather
than take their own. So then he had
five left. So in the last three minutes
of the game, coaches sometimes
could call as many as 10 timeouts,
and it would take 30 minutes to play
the last three minutes of the game.

You must remember, if all

I timeouts are used in a game, some-

times you could have l8-20 timeouts

during a 40 minute collegiate games 3.

It‘s like taking a 400-meter run and
making it a marathon. It may be
great for the guys on Madison
Avenue, but three extra pantyhose
commercials don’t make for good
basketball. And nobody needs time
for three more trips to the fridge.

Lady Panthers play host to West

Virginia tonight; Tanner speaks

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

 

Climbing those West Virginia
mountain ranges will not be one of
the problems Lady Panther basket-

ball coach Judy Saurer must con-'

tend with when her squad takes on
the Lady Mountaineers tonight at
7:30 p.m. at Fitzgerald Field House.

One sizable obstacle in Pitt's path
to victory however, is Mountaineer
Georgeann Wells, whose 6-7 counte-
nance casts a long shadow on Saur-
er‘s hopes of success.

“They say she can slam dunk,"the
Pitt coach remarked. “l’ve never
seen her do it, but that‘s what l’ve
been told.”

Wells, scoring 10 points per game,
is one of three WVU players scoring
in double digits. Olivia Bradley, at
6——7,puts in I3 ppg, and freshman
guard Alexis Basil contributes I0.
Janet Hoffman (9 ppg) and fresh~
man Kim Houser (also 9 ppg) com-
plete the probable Mountaineer
starting lineup.

“Our starting lineup changes from
time to time. game to game and even
practice to practice." said WVU
coach Kittie B1akemore.“lt depends
on who’s healthy.”

Coach Blakemore is hesitant
about making predictions but con-
cedes Pitt‘s home court advantage.
“Pitt~WVU games are always
tough, always competitive because
that’s how the teams play.”

“There have been a lot of
improvements on the field house,
renovations that make it look a lot
better,” Blakemore explained. “The
fans are very close to the floor, and
that makes a big, big difference."

Coach Saurer agrees, recalling
last year's game in Morgantown.

“Its always tough to play down
there,” said Saurer. “The Collise-
um‘s enormous, but that’s not the
reason. When we played down there
last year, we were even until the end.
There were a few bad calls near the
end, and we lost the game.”

The Lady Panthers lost to WVU
84-66 in a season when the Atlantic
[0 team went 17-12, including a vic-
tory over St. Joseph’s in the first
round of the conference
championships.

Pitt will be forced to combat the
Mountaineers without Lisa Fubio’s
8.6 ppg and 5.4 rebounds; the sopho-
more suffered an injury to her ankle

T in Saturday’s 65-58 loss at Seton

Hall and will be out 4-5 weeks. Top
scorers for Pitt in that game were
Jennifer Bruce and Kim Tirik, with
l6 each, and Stephanie Collins, with
I 1 points. Bruce also pulled down 9
rebounds, and Tirik had 8 assists.

Paste-up: Please insert a divider
here. Ask Charlie for details.

Tuesday afternoon, the Lady

Panther basketball team was visited .

by Pittsburgh Pirate manager
Chuck Tanner.

Tanner spoke to the women about
his philosophy on coaching and par-
ticipating as an athlete. “Don’t be
afraid to fail,” Tanner said. “As long
as you do your best and try your
hardest, then a coach can ask for

nothing more.” _
He went on to stress that the girls

have an outstanding opportunity
being able to represent a school like
Pitt. “When Pitt comes on the floor,
other teams believe they’re in for a
tough time.” .

“Those people in the stands wish
they were lucky enough to have the
opportunity to take one foul shot,"
he said.
