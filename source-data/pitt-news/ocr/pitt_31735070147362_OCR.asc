Walking in a “winter wonderland”
might be pleasant, but when stu-
dents are sniffling, coughing and
have exams all week, it becomesa
different experience.

Being sick or missing a ﬁnal

could be devastating, and there '

isn’t a University—Wide policy on

missed ﬁnals.

Dr. Elizabeth Wettick, director
of Student Health Service, provided
some advice for students as they
push through the ﬁnal days before
winter break. 2 _

One of her suggestions warned
students against relying on prod-
ucts that claim to boost people’s
immune systems. ,

Although Airborne woos buy-
ers with the promise of maximized

immunity, Wettick said in an e-mail
that standard health practices are
the most effective wards against
sickness. _

In order to prevent getting sick
during ﬁnals, she saidthere area
few things students can do.

Students should wash hands‘

“frequently,” get about 8 or more
hours of sleep and avoid those who

are ill by not sharing “drinks, lip.

balm; etc.” Wettick also stressed

that students should get ﬂu shots.
Drinking eight to 10 8—ounce
drinks per day is also helpful, Wet-
tick said. '
“Hydration is always impor-
tant. I generally recommend that
students take a medication that

‘targets’ the most bothersome

symptom. I am not partial to OTC
products . . . which combine a low,
often inadequate dose of multiple

C medications,” Wettick said.

Dave Wannstedt’s resignation left
even the experts scratching their
heads. .

He left, but he really hasn’t. His
decision to resign came amidst
rumors that he would be ﬁred.
And he might continue to coach
even after his resignation.

' The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette’s
Colin Dunlap sees the end of the
Wannstedt era as inherently para-

“It will be impossible to find

Protesters take a stand against drilling

The group took issue with the possibility of drilling on land owned by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History

Marissa Meredyth
Senior Staff Writer

Shouts and chanting broke
through yesterday’s chilly af-
ternoon air at a small protest in
front of the Carnegie Museum
of Natural History about poten-
tial Marcellus Shale drilling at
a nature reserve owned by the
museum. V

About 25 people showed up
at 5 p.m. to discourage the mu-
seum’s directors from leasing
2,200 acres of the Powdermill
Nature Reserve to gas drilling
companies interested in extract-
ing resources from the Marcellus
Shale Formation.

The Powdermill Nature Re-
serve has served as the biological
research station for the Carnegie
Museum of Natural History for
more than 50 years. The Carnegie
Museum joined 140 other land-
owners in Westmoreland County
to gain bargaining power in drill-
ing negotiations.

On the corner of Forbes Av-
enue and Craiggstreet, six secu-

rity guards for the Carnegie Mu-

‘ seum of Natural History awaited

environmental activists during
rush hour yesterday after hear-
ing news a protest would occur
around 5 p.m.

As reported by the Pittsburgh
Post Gazette last month, the
Western Pennsylvania Conser-
vancy would prevent a drill rig
built directly on the nature re-
serve, but it would not prevent
a drill on nearby property. New
horizontal drilling technology
would allow a company to reach
the shale a mile under the Pow-
dermill Nature Reserve.

Protesters said leasing the
land could negatively impact the

‘environment, making any proﬁt

on the museum’s part moot.

Representatives from the
museum could not be immedi-
ately reached for comment last
night.

Most concerns involved the
poisoning of water resources as
a potential result of the use of
fracking to extract the gas. Hy-
draulic fracturing, or fracking,

would violate the student’s privacy,”
Wettick said.

Students who get sick and miss
their ﬁnals need to communicate
with professors about their illnesses
and make up exams, Wettick said.

For students who miss their ﬁ-
nals because of illness, Katherine

adviser and lecturer — said most
professors state their policies in

the syllabus, but “if you have a ma-
jor problem, go to the department
chair. It’s not up to me to decide
how sick you are.”

“A cold is not an excuse. I can
come to work with a cold,” she said.

“If you are ill, see your department‘
_chair, It’s your best bet.”

Oronde Sharif, major adviser
and lecturer in the Department of
Africana Studies, said that he makes

accommodations. ,
“I try to ﬁgure out what is going

on, either set up a time to somehow‘

make it up if they have a medical
reason,” Sharif said. “I work with
people. You need to make arrange-
ments.”

Sharif also advised students to
go to their adviser and dean’s of-
ﬁce.

History Department Chair Reid

Andrews said his department has A

no ofﬁcial policy on ﬁnals absences;
those decisions are left to the pro-
fessors’ discretion. Andrews said
that students rarely have to come
to him to make up aﬁnal, but more
often a midterm. If students provide
proof that they are sick, Andrews
said he will arrange a make-up ﬁ-
nal.

“The student is almostalways

sors,” he said.

Amy Smith, a freshman, said she
is not the type to get sick for a long
period of time and that she would‘

week if she got sick.

“I would just lay in bed and
study,” she said. _“Maybe get some-
one to help me study.” I

involves the pumping of liquid at high
pressure into the shale formation to break
up the rock, freeing the natural gas.

On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh City Council,
which has already banned drilling within
city limits, issued a ‘.‘Will of Council” urg-
ing the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie
Institute to “reject any and all offers of
shale gas exploration and extraction,” ac-
cording to the City Council’s minutes.

The Council also urged the Trustees -

“to stay true to its mission” and said that
they will help “support them in any and all
actions necessary to preserve the natural
integrity of the Powdermill Nature Re-
serve.” ,

Mel Packer, with the Marcellus Shale
Protest, said, “We never said we are against

 _ drilling.” The group just worries about the .

safety of it, he said.

While the majority of those protesting
held banners saying, “We can’t drink mon-
ey!” or “Save Powdermill,” others chanted,
“Proﬁts from drilling are thrilling, safety
from fracking is lacking.”

A few protesters handed out ﬂiers de-
tailing how toxic chemicals such as ben-
zene, ethylene, toluene and xylene could
end up in drinking water.

Seven police officers also showed up

to observe the protest, which remained

peaceful. The police advised one protester .

to stay out of the street when she tried to
hand fliers to cars passing by.

One motorist shouted,‘ “Drill, baby,
drill,” as he passed the protesters. »

Two Pitt students joined the predomi-
nantly older crowd. Senior Tyler‘Custer,
a math major, expressed concern about
why drilling would be allowed in what is
supposed to be a conserved space. .

“It’s dangerous,” Custer said’, fearing
contamination of the area.

Environmental studies major Mike
Rhodes said he’s heard about the issue in
most of his classes.

“It is a hot issue right now,” Rhodes
said. ’ .

Bystanders paid little attention to the
protest, and attempted to walk around the
scene with headphones, in.

Victoria Sarra, a Pitt student who was
waiting for the bus, watched the protest.

- Sarra said she had heard about drilling

in her hometown in the Monongahela
valley.

“I’m not really an environmentalist,
but I did see the documentary ‘Gasland.”’
Sarra said. “Some of the stuff that happens
is pretty scary.” I

— metal which could be thrown away
when it dulled. On Sept. 28, 1901, Gillette
founded the American Safety Razor Com-
pany — later changing the name to the
Gillette Safety Razor Company — and in a
few short years, he made his fortune. After
all,’ at least half of the world’s population
would be the targeted consumer.

For some time, Gillette was something
of an international celebrity, with his face
featured on every wrapper of the billions
and billions of Gillette razor blades sold
around the world.But today, like a discard-
ed coffee cup, Gillette’s story is out of mind.
Even though the philosophy of convenience
and accessibility might have created a tra-
jectory leading to later inventions such
as disposable syringes and paper—saving
e—mail, the consumerist empire Gillette
began to found directly contradicted his

' innate philosophy.

Gillette was actually a utopian socialist,
believing in a society based on idealism
rather than materialism. He wrote books
promoting a socialist utopia. In one of his
polemical tracts, “The Human Drift,” he
cited competition as thefroot of all evil.

Gillette’s story, we should be more aware
of what happens when we compromise
our morality in favor of money. Money is
the way our world works, and I think that

everyone — no matter how virtuous —

has a price.

So even though I’m not the world’s
greatest environmentalist, I think that Gil-
lette’s story should make us more aware of
how much we do throw away. Maybe in all
things we should start looking for more
permanence and less disposability instead
of always pitching out what we could later
use. Disposability makes money, but it also
makes for cheap production. There’s no

‘harm in taking reusable cloth bags to the

an idealist to say that we can undo what’s

learning to value something, to hold onto

The Second City presents “Fair
and Unbalanced”

Mocking politicians is nothing new,
but for the Second City, it never ex-
actly gets old, either.

The Second City — the Chica-
go improv troupe that gave rise to
comedy bigwigs like Tina Fey, Steve
Carell and Bill Murray — has put

together a collection of new and
old sketches that cast member Tim
Stoltenberg believes are timeless in
their ability to poke ﬁm at America’s
leaders.

“It’s a collection of archive
scenes that still pertain to today,”
Stoltenberg said. “Political satire is
the theme to a lot of the show. How
can we put our own spin on it, you
know? But we don’t favor one side
or the other.”

Whereas many people know the
Second City more for its famous
alumni than its current rosterof
comedic talent, Katie Rich, another
cast member, said “Fair and Unbal-
anced” is sure to draw attention to
some of the troupe’s most uproari-
ous sketches.

“It’s a ‘best of’ review. We fea-
ture things from our 50-year his-
tory. We have scenes written byjohn
Belushi, Tina Fey and a few originals
by us,” Rich said. “The scenes deal
with politics. It’s mostly social and
political commentary.”

Whereas some of the Nixon and
Reagan jokesmight seem dated,
both Rich and fellow cast member
Shad Kunkle promised that all the
older sketches have an updated
twist that will appeal to audiences
of any age. 4

As far as politics go, “Fair and
Unbalanced” straddles the line be-
tween political parties, trying not
to ridicule one side more than the
other. The idea is1_1’t to make fun of
any one group in particular, but the

Year after year, many Christmas
productions feature a basic nativity
plot, a children’s choir and a script
that doesn’t change. “Nativity: A

Christmas Gift,” however, has only.

one thing in common with these
productions: the story itself.
“Nativity: A Christmas Gift”
is a loose adaptation of the 1960s
Langston Hughes play, “Black Na-

tivity.” The Shona Sharif African Dance and
Drum Ensemble — part of Pitt’s Department

of Africana Studies — will perform the musi-'

cal production on the Seventh Floor Audito-
rium of Alumni Hall this weekend and next
weekend.

’°' Uma Satyavolu, who teaches in Pitt’s Eng-

lish department and is familiar with Hughes’
work, said “Black Nativity” is a “basic nativ-
ity play.” .

“It uses a narrator who tells the birth of
the babyjesus,” she said. “It strings together
African—American spirituals.” V .

Hughes, Satyavolu said, kept his play simi- .

lar to the biblical story. He connects black
traditions to the earliest models of the na-
tivity story, and the two separate acts each
represent a different time period. The ﬁrst act

focuses on the birth ofjesus, and the second V

is set in more modern times.

Oronde Sharif, the artistic director of »

“Nativity: A Christmas Gift,” and son of the
late Shona Sharif, the founder of Pitt’s pro-

duction, said the performance — although
a liberal adaptation — retains one aspect of
the original play: a similar conception of the
birth of Jesus. This, however, is where the
similarities end.

“Everything else [in “Nativity: A Christmas
Gift”] is kind of ‘us’,” said Sharif, who also con-
tributes to the choreography and acts as a cast
member. “We still use some of the dialogue,
but it’s really a combination of how we tell the
story and use different characters.”

Unlike “Black Nativity,” “Nativity: A
Christmas Gift” does not have two distinctly
separate acts. Rather, the adaptation jumps
from scene to scene and seamlessly combines
the two portions of “Black Nativity,” Sharif
said.

The biggest difference between “Nativity: '

A Christmas Gift” and other annual Christmas _
shows is that it incorporates African dance
and drumming.

“Most of the African dances come from

. Senegal and Mali, in addition to modern and

jazz dance,” Sharif said.

Sharif explained that many different
groups perform a variation of “Black Nativity,”
but to his knowledge, this production is the
only one with traditional African dance.

Lamont Chatman, a drummer in the per-’

formance who also plays the role of King
Herod, has been part of the show for 12 sea-
sons. He explained that each year something
changes in the production.

“Every year it’s a little different.’ We change
something — from choreography to dancing
to drum rhythms to singing. The audience
doesn’t see the same thing,” he said.

“He keeps the legacy going —— his mom’s
legacy,” Chatman said of Sharif.

Sharif said the production eventually be.-
came so differentiated from its source mate-
rial that anew title was necessary.

“We took a step further and changed the
name, because it’s no longer Langston Hughes’
play,” he said. ,

With a different title, Sharif has more room

‘Nativity’ touches onlfamilystruggle during holidays

for variation, and can covera wider range
of issues. . .

Whereas the play sometimes touches on
difficult events -—— one scene depicts a char-
acter struggling to cope with a death in his
family —— Sharif said the production aims to
demonstrate how to ﬁnd cheer in hardship
during the holidays.

“Sometimes you’re dealing with family
problems around Christmas,» and it’s‘ not all
happy,” Sharif said. “Howcan we make some-
thing like that cheerful? It’s a different spin.
It’s what the Christmas season is all about.”

Both Sharif and Chatman stress the im-
portance of their unique take on the play and
the ability it has to reach a cross—cultural au-
dience.

“It gives  awhole other look on the nativ-
ity,” Chatman said of the play. “A lot of people
are used to seeingthe one form of nativity that
you see on TV, but with the African drum-
ming and dancing it’s telling a story, all done
through the dancing and drumming.” I

Second City grounded in vvit, ‘blue collar sensibility’

Unbalanced 4 7

entire system as a whole.

Drawing from what Kunlde calls Chicago’s
“blue collar sensibility,” the cast member
said, “Fair and Unbalanced” does what many
other comedic shows fail to do: Convey down-
to—earth humor while still remainingsmart
and clever. '

“It does have that ‘everyman’ appeal. The
Second City started out entertaining blue—
collar guys who were just getting off from
work. But we really don’t take ourselves too
seriously,” Kunkle said.

Rich added that whereas the show will be
tweaked on certain occasions to accommo-

’date the city in which the cast is performing,
on the whole, the comedy stays the same re-
gardless of whether the state is red or blue.

Along with appealing to both sides of the
political spectrum, both Rich and Kunkle
feel that “Fair and Unbalanced” is the kind

   

of show that will engage people of all ages,
especially college students.,In fact, the Second
City has already made strides in attracting
such an audience —— gaining attention this
past'year through viral videos like “Sassy Gay
Friend” and “Advice from a Disney Princess”

— and believes this production is another .

step in the right direction.

“It will deﬁnitely appeal to college stu-
dents. Students are the ones who enjoy Sec-
ond City. Things like ‘The Daily Show,’ ‘The
Colbert Report,’ The Onion’  we’re in that
same vein. And they enjoy that,” Rich said.

All in all, Rich said the Second City prides
itself in one thing: staying sharp.

“The Second City is deﬁnitely on the cut-

ting edge of comedy, we have launched a lot of
careers, and students are savvy to the up-and-
comers in comedy,” Kunkle said. “In general
the material is very smart.” I‘

Wannstedt situation uncommon

Wannstedt 4 1

experts yielded little consensus
about what is happening at Pitt
right now. .

The experts generally agreed
that Wannstedt staying at Pitt
makes this coaching change un-
like most of the hundreds that
came before it. ‘ L

“From where I sit, it looks
normal, other than the golden
parachute Wannstedt got to stick
around the athletic department,”
said Gregg Doyel, a columnist for
CBSSports.com. “But given that
Pitt’s his alma ‘mater, it’s not a
surprise.” _ ..

Part of the confusion sur-
rounding Wannstedt’s current
status centers on athletic direc-
tor Steve Pederson giving him the
option of coaching the]an.«8 BBVA
Compass Bowl. The journalists
agreed that Wannstedt’s ties with
Pitt might have played a role, but
only a couple could remember
somebody coaching a bowl when
his departure was imminent.

.“When a coach leaves for an-
other school, the school he’s leav-
ing never lets him coach,” blog-—
ger Chris Dokish said. “The only
coach I can think of that was asked
to resign was Bobby Bowden at

Florida State last year. He beat
West Virginia, and they carried
him off the ﬁeld. I’m guessing
if Wannstedt coaches the ﬁnal
game and Pitt wins, there will be
a similar outpouring of emotion
for him.” .

CBSPittsburgh.com blogger
Chris Gates doesn’t see Wannst-
edt deciding to coach the game,
although the Tribune-Review
reported last night that he likely
will. V

“I don’t think that’s something
he’s going to elect to do, given that
they’re actively pursuing a new
coaching sta ,” Gates said;

Impact on recruiting

Pantherlair.com’s Chris Peak
closely follows Pitt’s recruiting
efforts, which he said will inevi-
tably be hampered by Wannstedt’s
departure. 7 '

&“With the recruits, it’s all just 1 A l
uncertainty right now,”jPeak said. ,

“They got recruited by the cur-
rent assistant coaches. If they’re

gone, then the recruits have to,

wonder, ‘Well, ,who’s going to be

 BASKETBALL

No. 11 Tennessee

Kelly Flanigan
Staﬂ" Writer

Pitt already has one home, and sort
of two. Over the years, the men’s
basketball team has shown that
it has a clear advantage at both
the Petersen Events Center and
Madison Square Garden in New
York City.

This Saturday though, No.
3-ranked Pitt will attempt to ﬁnd
a third “home” when it takes on

~ No. 11 Tennessee at its second

game in the Consol Energy Center

Downtown.

The ﬁrst win for the Panthers
at Consol cameagainst city rival
Duquesne, which Pitt (10-0) hand-
ily defeated 80-66.

Pitt hopes for a similar out-
come when it tips off at 3:15 p.m. in
what could be its most challenging
matchup so far thisseason.

The Volunteers (6-0) come to
, Pittsburgh as a dangerous team

riding a six-game winning streak

and 11 days off to focus on prac— _

tice. .
“[Tennessee is] very experi-
enced; I’d say they’re probably

to testPanthers at Consol

more experienced than we are,”
head coach Jamie Dixon said.
“They are very deep. They run a
lot of plays similar to what we run.
They’re good, and our guys know
that, and I think they have a re-
spect for our program as well.”
The Volunteers boast a con-
vincing win early in the season
against Pitt’s Big East Conference
rival Villanova, a preseason top-
10 team. , ' A
“‘It’s a good matchup, and I
‘think it’s what everybody hoped
for when they put this Big East/SEC
matchup together,” Dixon said in

131\iI.A11AnA,4n-rllnotinun --4*--~<<-

a news conference.

The Volunteers have a healthy
mix of leadership and youth in
their starting ﬁve. In particular,
Pitt needs to look out for junior
guards Scotty Hopson and Cam-
eron Tatum. Hopson averages 16.3
points per game, and Tatum aver-
ages 11.8. A

Head coach Bruce Pearl cited
breakdowns in communication
and especially turnover issues as
his team’s major weaknesses at this
point in the season.

“We turned it over too much,”
Pearl said. “I thought many of our

3..

turnovers were just bad decisions
about the way we take it, when to‘
break it down. We forced it in some
trafﬁc situations and made some
poor decisions.”

The Panthers come into Sat-
urday’s game off a 70-42 win over
Delaware State on Wednesday,
night.

The team’s performance against
the Hornets encouraged Dixon.

“I thought we did some things
well, such as rebounding, defend-
ing and taking care of the ball,”
Dixon said. “Those were some‘
points that we’ve been emphasiz-

THINKING OF QUITTING

SMOKING?

 

The University of Pittsburgh seeks smokers aged f8~65
who are already planning to quit smoking to participate
in a 9-week research study on the shon-term effects of

p two oral medications on smoking behavior, craving,
and mood. One is FDA—approved for smoking cessation,
Zyban (buproplonl, and the other is FDA-approved

, for wakefulness, Provigil (modaiinil). This is not a
treatment study.

You will be asked to take study medication that may
or may not contain the active components. Research
study participants will be compensated.

Although this study is not a treatment trial. everyone
who completes the study will be offered optional brief
counseling and Zyban tbupropionl at no cost after the
study is over to help them quit permanently.

to take care of them. It’s been a good stretch
of games for us.”

Pitt currently leads the nation in re-
bounding. -

If Pitt wants to have similar success on
Saturday, it will need players like Brad Wa-
namaker, Ashton Gibbs and Gary McGhee
to be scoring threats like they were early
in the season. ' V

Gibbs scored only nine points on Wednes-
day, well below his season average. McGhee

I will have competition on the boards, too, as

the Volunteers boast two players at 6-foot-
8-inches, one at 6-foot—9 and another at
6-foot-10.

In addition, Pitt will need continued
production from bench players like Dante
Taylor,_].J. Moore and especially the physical

play of Nasir Robinson.

Not only does this game feature two
competitive teams, but two successful head
coaches as well. Jamie Dixon is two wins
away from his 200th career victory and has
a .786 winning percentage at Pitt.

Bruce Pearl has a .775 win percentage in
his six years at Tennessee. Both coaches are
among the top—four winningest active head
coaches in at least ﬁve years of Division I
college basketball.

But Saturday’s contest is the only thing
on Dixon’s mind right now. .

“Our focus right now is solely on Ten-
nessee,” he said.

The game is part of the DIRECTV SEC/
Big East Invitational, which also features
a Rutgers—Auburn matchup at 12:30 p.m.

work with him?’”

Peak does see a silver lining for Pitt,
though.

“A lot of guys were sold on the idea of the
University — playing at Heinz Field, play-
ing at this school,” he said. “They all talked
about education during their recruitment,
when they were committing.

“Well, if they really care about the educa-
tion and the value of the education here,” he
said, “then they’ll stick with Pitt.”

Replacements
The experts think there area wide vari-
ety of candidates who could ﬁt as Wannst-

edt’s successor.
Suggestions included Paul Chryst (Wis-

coach), Paul Rhoades (Iowa State head
coach and former Pitt defensive coordina-
tor), Mike Leach (former Texas Tech head
coach), Al Golden (Temple head coach) and
Tom Bradley (Penn State defensive coor-
dinator). I
Stewart Mandel, senior writer for Sports
Illustrated, ﬁnds it difficult to predict who
Pitt’s next head coach will be based on Ped-
erson’s history as the athletic director at
Nebraska. I
- “Pederson is anything but predictable,”
Mandel said. “Nobody in a million years

would have guessed that Bill Callahan would

coach Nebraska football.” ,
Wannstedt’s Future

Wannstedt will remain with Pitt as a spe-
cial assistant to the athletic director, but the
meaning of that is unclear as well. But Doyel
thinks it’s a poor ﬁt for Wannstedt.

“Dave Wannstedt is a football coach. I i

can’t imagine he doesn’t want to keep being
a football coach,” Doyel said. “And I can’t
imagine that it’s as amicable as they’re mak-
ing it out to be in the press release.” 3
