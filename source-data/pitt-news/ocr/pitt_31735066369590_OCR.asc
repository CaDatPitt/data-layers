Board of Trustees Revamps Library Science Program  

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Graduate School of Library
and Information Sciences, begin-
ning in September, will offer a new
undergraduate program leading to
a bachelor of science degree in
information science.

The new program was approved
yesterday by Pitt’s Board of
Trustees at its spring meeting in
the Executive Suite of the Forbes
Quadrangle. S

The graduate school, to be
known as the School of Library and
Information Sciences this fall, will a
accept third-year undergrads for
the program but will continue to
offer graduate programs.

“A major in information science

is relevant to a wide range of fields
or careers,” reads a statement by
Thomas Galvin, dean of graduate
school. “The behaviorial emphasis
of the program is of particular

significance to those planning to.

continue studies in business
administration and in the social
science areas.”

As expected, the trustees post-
poned approval of Pitt’s 1979-80
budget and passage of any tuition
increases because of the state
budget deadlock by the General
Assembly.

“The development of a final
budget proposal should be deferred
until the state assembly passes the
university’s state appropriations,”

said Jack Freeman, vice chancellor

. for budget and planning.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar and
Board-Chairman Roger Ahlbrandt
expressed hope that the appro-
priations situation would be solved
before July 1, the beginning of the
new fiscal year. A tuition increase
will most likely be passed by the
Board’s Executive Committee
sometime in mid-June.

“I doubt you will get a resolution
by June,” said trustee W. Louis
Coppersmith, democratic senator
from Johnstown. “I think you may
get it by the end of June. - I think
Senator (Robert) Fleming would
agree on this.”

“I tend to disagree,” responded
Fleming, former republican Sena-

tor from Allegheny County. Fe1m-
ing is an emeritus member of the
board.

In other business, the board
approved the document “Univer-
sity Planning Policies for the
1980’s,” which was drafted last
summer. The document analyzes
the projected decline in enrollment
for the next decade and resulting
monies and facilitites.

Described as a “living, revolving
document” by Posvar, the plan will
undergo periodic revision and will
be extensively reviewed by‘ the
trustees at an all-day meeting
sometime this fall to “review
planning for the 1980's.”

“We expect the. document to
undergo constant revision," said

Posvar.

the most up-to-date version.”

“It (the document) is an
excellent approach,”
of enrollment and financial
affairs.”

Posvar congratulated David
Engel, president of the University
Senate, on his nomination as
Pittsburgh Board of Education
representative for the seventh ward
(parts of Oakland and Shadyside).
Who’s name appeared on both

ballots, lost the democratic bid but_ '
, won in the republican primary.

“David went to bed a democrat
and woke up a republican,” Posvar
joked.

Cause of ForbesA ve.
‘Explosions Still Undetermined

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

The cause of last week’s
electrical explosions and accom-
panying power failure is still
unknown, according to Dick Dwyer
supervisor of _ public imformation
for Duquense Light.

The explosions knocked out the
Oakland power substation which
serves 25,000 customers in the
city’s East End. A chain reaction
resulted setting off explosions in
the underground lines on Forbes

Avenue near the Carnegie Institute
and museum and at a transformer
in Squirrel Hill.

Manhole covers were blown off
the ground in a seven block area
around Carnegie Institute and
injured five persons in front of the

Stephen Foster Memorial on"

Forbes Avenue.

It was originally reported by the A

local news media the unexplained
failure of a 23,000 volt power cable
caused an accumulation of sewer
gas to explode.

what I did on my summer vacatlon?!?....

Dwyer said yesterday that city
inspectors found no evidence of gas
in or around the underground lines,
however.

“The explosion was due to a
faulty cable-why (the explosions
occurred)-I don’t know,”‘he said.

Dwyer said Duquesne Light was
still investigating the cause of the
explosions and that it may take a
long time to determine those
causes.

Three of the five people injured
in the blasts remain hospitalized.

Alphonso Provenso, 12, of
Oakland, remains in serious
condition at Mercy Hospital while
Meyer Feinberg, 64, of Squirrel
Hill and Robert Robertson, 35, of
Mount Lebanon remain in satis-
factory condition at West Penn
Hospital.

“When the trustees ,
discuss it in the fall they will have ‘

Ahlbrandt. “It brings up questions ‘

Duquesne Light Company authorities are still uncertain what caused Forbes

Ave. manhole covers to explode last Wednesday.

Environment, Finance Problems
Cause Possible Titusville Close

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

In an effort to alleviate foreseen
enrollment and financial problems
associated with the Titusville
campus, a proposal has been drawn
up to close that branch.

The proposal ‘was initiated by
Associate Provost Robert Nossen to
become effective as of the end of
the academic year, 1980-81.

Since its inception in 1963,
Titusville, which is one of four
branch campuses of the University,
has enrolled the least students and
yet remains the highest in per unit
operating costs.

Nossen said that attempts to
increase enrollment and lower
costs were made prior to his
proposal, but that there is little
evidence indicating any significant
change at Titusville in the coming
years.

The proposal points out ﬁscal
reality facing Pitt the next decade
is significant.

Charts show that total university
revenues have increase 17 percent
in the past four years while
inﬂation four has climbed by 21
percent. To compensate for the 4

9

percent differential probably
means continuation of a tuition
increase_ trend established over the
past few years. Such a trend could
more than likely price middle and
lower income students out of
higher education, dropping enroll-
ment at Pitt.

A The university has begun a
review of every program, depart-
ment, school, and regional campus
of the institution to find areas in
which to make program reductions
that release funds for assisting the
university during financial crisis.
Rational priorities along with con-
ceived program reductions and
resource management is what
Nossen believes will allow the
university to sustain the quality of
essential programs.

Faculty Senate Committee mem-
ber Professor Frank Wediken is
one of many who are in opposition
to Nossen’s proposal. In his fight
to keep Titusville running Wediken
does not believe that closure would
relieve financial problems as much
as Nossen states they will.

“Closing the Titusville campus
will not really save the university
that much money,” said Wediken.

“Figures show that money saved
will only constitute ﬁve-tenths
percent of the ﬁnancial costs. “I
think that we could start cutting
elsewhere, like the duplication of
courses,” Wediken added. I

Another disagreement between
the two sides arises over the fact
that Titusville was originally
constructed to give students in the
area a local access to the
university.

Nossen believes that enrollment
of this sort is not really present,
while Wediken shows that distri-
bution of enrollment brings many
students from a seven county area
surrounding Titusville.

“We enroll about 40 percent of
our students from the area, and
another 40 percent from South-
western Pennsylvania,” said Wed-
iken. “The remaining 20 percent
comes from a member of different
areas. We took a survey of other
area colleges such as Edinboro and
Gannan, and found the same
figures of enrollment, give or take
one or two percent. I can’t see why
our school "should then seem so
outlandish.”

Pitt Batmen Finish With 1 4-6 Record But Miss NCAA Bid

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s baseball team finished its
season with a 14-6 record.

The Panthers were scheduled to
meet Buffalo Tuesday at Trees
Field, but the makeup double-
header was cancelled because of
Buffalo's appearance in the up-
coming ECAC playoffs. V

Panther coach Bob Lewis,
encouraged with his team’s record,
already looks forward to next
season and the start of fall
practice. '

“I think we have improved since
last year,” Lewis said, noting last

 

season’s 11-17-1 record. “Our
sophomores played much better
than they did as freshmen.

“But we haven’t peaked yet” the
Panther coach said. “We have a
young team. We only lose three
people. (Pitchers Marc Bianco,
Dave Crist, and Tony DiSaia are all
seniors).”

Returning next ‘season will be
catcher Jim Pastin, first baseman

Invitational this Monday.

00 Pantherette Mitchell

By ANNA ARLOT'I‘A
Pitt News Staff Writer
After ﬁnishing her sophomore
year in high school, Linda Mitchell
decided running in individual races
just wasn’t what she wanted to do

"injthe sport of track at nearby North

Hills High School.

Mitchell had just taken sixth in
the running of the 220-yard dash at
the WPIAL meet when she made
up her mind to switch to another
area.

Since the days when she began
to run or; many of the high school
relay teams, up until her participa-
tion on the AIAW national"-bound
440- and 800- medley relay teams,
Mitchell's young career has been
rewarding.

Mitchell wasn’t able to run track
in her early years in school because
her junior high didn’t have an
organized team. In order to run,
Mitchell sought her own competi-
tion in the form of the boys track
team or other girls. Upon arrival in
senior high, Mitchell began run-
ning the 100 and 220 open races,
along with running a number of the
relay races (she ran just about all of
the relay events-—the 440, 880.

Bigler photo

mile and medley). After her
sixth-place honors in the 220 her
sophomore year, she decided to run
only the relay events.

“I didn't want to run the open
races because I’m better in a team
situation,” said Mitchell. “I run
better when I know that people are
depending on me than when I run
open events.”

Her accomplishments since
starting to run relays have been
proof that Mitchell is a good runner
to depend upon. Running the
anchor leg on the mile relay teams
in her junior and senior years, her
team was able to place second both
seasons at the state meets. Her
performances earned her the Most
Valuable Player award of her high
school, along with being named the
MVP for the Mars Invitational meet

' (a big high school event in her area)

for three years in a row.

After high school, Mitchell really
didn't want to run on a competitive
level. Fortunately for Pitt head
coach Alfreeda Goff, she was
convinced to come to Pitt.

“Things turned out rather well
since I have been at Pitt,” said
Mitchell. “I'really‘enjoy the people

. Massa,

Mesiano, Sakanich, Stevens and
Roperti are juniors, while Pastin,
Mihalik and Kline are
sophomores. *

Pitchers Jim Boyle, Don Koller,
Mike Luciow, Tim Moran, Allen

Lachowicz and Larry Lamonde will

also return next season.

According to Lewis, Pitt will
work on “fundamentals” during
fall practice.

“Fall practice is good in that it
allows us to concentrate on our
fundamentals,” the Panther coach
said. “The more you practice, the
better you are. Repetition makes

things automatic and mistakes are
minimized.

“Our fundamentals were good
last season, but we want continued
improvement,” Lewis said. “We
only missed two signals this
season. We were very alert on both
our pickoff and relay plays.”

Because of Pitt's continuing
de-emphasis on non-revenue
sports, scholarships will not be
given to baseball recruits next
season. 0

Despite this, Lewis does not

anticipate any problems recruiting. *

“The education itself at Pitt

attracts its share of recruits,”
Lewis said. “I get a lot of kids who
are interested in pre-dent and
pre-law because Pitt has such
excellent programs in those ﬁelds.

“Allen Lachowicz came here he
wants to be an engineer,” Lewis
continued. “Jim Boyle and Marc
Bianco are in pre-dent.”

Lachowicz, a pitcher from
McKees Rocks, is the first Panther
baseball player to receive an
athletic scholarship. He, Larry
Lamonde and Mike Fitzpatrick
were Pitt's top recruits last season.
All played for the Panthers this
season. ,

Coaches Make Changes
For Track Invitational

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

When the Panther men’s track
travels to the Penn State Invita-
tional Monday there will be an
emphasis on preparation for’ next
week’s Central Collegiate Con-
ference meet.

Coach Mike Agostinella and his
assistants Mel Boyd (long distance
coach) and Dan Goodyear (jumping
events coach) will be involved in
some serious realigning of runners
in an effort to create the best team
possible to compete at Central
Collegiates, to be held at Notre
Dame.

“We are using Monday’s open
invitational as preparation for the
conference meet,” said
Agostinella. ,“We want to look at
all our individual runners in events
other than the ones they have been
participating in throughout the
season. This will allow us to cover
all phases of the team, with the
moves allowing us to look at
everyone in different. events. ’ ’

Distance coach Boyd (a 5000
meter run specialist on last year's
Panther track team) agrees with
the advantages of change.

“We are going to put some of the
runners in different events than
those in which they have been
participating in all year, so that we
are able to come up with the best
possible combination for the next

weekend conference meet,” said
Boyd. With the long distance
runners, our aim is for them not to
have to be worked too much earlier
in the week, since they will be
running the conference meet only a
few days later. For instance, Mark
Studnicki who would usually run
the 10,000 meter run, will be
running the 5000 meter and Gary
Siriano, who would have run the
5000, will be going in the 1500.”

A number of other changes will
take place besides these two long
distance moves. Instead of running
the usual quartet of Larry Shippen,
Dwayne DeFoor, Buddy Morris. and
Keith Leckenby in the mile relay,
Agostinella will be choosing from a
large group of half-milers. The
individual runners who par-
ticipated earlier this year in the
2-mile relay team will be among the
top contestants for the job; Darren
Geary, Greg Conover, Bill McShea
and Joel ‘Alvers. In addition to
these, Dan Dattilo, Mark Bodnar
and Curt Goltz are also being
looked upon to run one of the legs
for the relay.

The Penn State Invitational will
be open to all colleges or clubs, and
an expected 25-30 teams will be
involved. Considered to be among
the top competitors in the meet will

‘be Howard University, who has a

ﬁne group of half-milers, and a
respectable mile relay team. Other

top -name teams involved in

‘Mondays’ meet will be Rutgers,

Essex Community College and
Hagerstown (who competed last
weekend at Pitts Invitational, a
meet headed by Hagerstown’s first
place ﬁnisher in the high jump,
Ken Glover).

Penn State was by far the most"

impressive overall team par-
ticipating in last week’s meet at
Pitt. The Nittany Lions took a total
of ﬁve ﬁrst-place honors. Winning
events for the Lions were the
400-meter relay‘ team (Pitt was
runnerup), Larry Mangan in the
1500-meter run, Mark Heckel in
the hammer throw, Bill Austin in
the intermediate hurdles and Bruce

Baden in the 3000-meter
steeplechase.
The Panthers are looking

forward to a successful ﬁnish on
Monday and will then look forward
to the Central Collegiate meet a
few days later.

“We are looking forward to
ﬁnishing the season on a strong
note,” said Agostinella. ‘‘.We are
looking forward to ﬁnishing the
season on a strong note,” said
Agostinella. “We have done well
indoor and outdoor this year, and
we expect to do well this coming
week. We are hoping to ﬁnish in
the top ten in the conference meet,

as we have been able to do in past
years.”

is One to Rely Upon for Relays

here, the track team and being able
to go to so many different places to
run.”

The Pantherettes were happy to
have Mitchell at the Eastern meet
last weekend in New York, as she
was an important part of the 400'
and 800 medley relay teams
successfully qualifying for the
national meet to be held next
weekend.

When the Pantherettes travel to
Michigan to compete, four mem-
bers of the team will be entered

only in both relay events. Both of .

the teams will consist of the same
girls: Leslie Palmer, Cissy Wil-

born, Gwen Murray and Mitchell... ,

Mitchell will anchor the 400 team
and run the third leg (200 yards) of
the medley.

“Finally... we (the medley team)
were, able to take ﬁrst place at
Easterns along with running the
440 relay third with a time of 47.2,”
said Mitchell.

Looking towards the nationals,
the Pantherettes will leave next
Tuesday. Mitchell sees a bright
ending to the season. i

can always rely upon in relays.
