Vendor
returns
until case
appealed

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Staff Writer

A young woman in a purple
turtleneck walked up and shook
Charles Bonasorte’s hand,
congratulating him. “I don’t even
know who that was,” said
Bonasorte. Another woman, a
student, said, “You guys are back.
Good for you.”

Bonasorte, the Oakland vendor
whose petition to the city was
signed by approximately 3,500
students and passers-by, was once
more on the intersection of Forbes
Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard,
open for business last Friday.

“I pulled [my truck] up, and the
crowd was cheering and giving
me the thumbs—up lsignl,” said
Bonasorte. “I love them. These
kids and the faculty are great.”

Two weeks ago Bonasorte was
notified by the city building
inspector’s office that his license
and the licenses of his four
employees had been revoked for
violations of the Pittsburgh
Business Licensing Act.

On Thursday a hearing was
held in the office of building
inspector Chief Dominick Cimino
to appeal the revocation.

During the appeal Bonasorte’s
lawyer, Raymond Radakovich,
maintained that his client had
never been provided with any
solid reasons as to why his license
and the licenses of his employees
had been revoked.

“We’ve heard various reasons
given to us over the last two
weeks, which we have attempted
to dispel,” said Radakovich. “You
[Cimino] revoked the license. You
tell me why. We have absolutely
no idea under the law.”

Cimino maintained that
Bonasorte was charged with
conducting his business at a
stationary location, which he

celebrates
Coming
Out Day

By Marietta Pacella
Staﬂ" Writer

National Comin g Out Day gives
people an opportunity to be open
about their sexuality and to
express themselves, according to
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance co—president Melissa
Smith.

An information table was set
up in the lower-level hallway of
the William Pitt Union on
Thursday, surrounded by a large
group of BiGALA members,
outside supporters, a Gay Cable
Network camera operator and a
door poster of Madonna. A

“lThe] Madonna [poster] was
with us last year on National
Coming Out Day. There’s an
openness about Madonna. She
expresses herself, and that’s what
we're doing now. I think that if
we were a lot more open about
ourselves, things would be a lot
different,” said Smith.

National Coming Out Day
originated after a march in
Washington, D.C., in June 1987.
The march supported the
Stonewall incident in which a gay
bar in Greenwich Village suffered
what was proven to be a
harassment attack. An estimated
600,000 people took part in the
march, yet it was entirely
unrecognized by the media. This
event got people to fight back,
and National Coming Out Day
was born, according to Smith.

Ben Heggy, who supported the
event, feels that it is extraordinarily
important for everyone to do his
or her share in support of National
Coming Out Day.

“It is important that we be as
out as possible so that other
people don’t feel repressed,” he
said.

“This day is important to pierce
people’s consciousness. People
don’t think they know anyone

SGB's South Oakland Shuttle will run permanently

By Randy Legersky
Staff Writer

The South Oakland shuttle will continue
on a permanent basis, after high student
use during a six-week trial period proved
it was a necessary service.

“Bill Brennan, vice president for
administration, decided to rework his
budget and shift the shuttle schedule
around so that there was money there to

continue it,” said Student Government
Board member Brian Felgoise.

The SGB announced the continuation
of the shuttle at its meeting last week.

“Initially, what they have been doing
[is] leasing the van and the driver. It was
just a period to determine if it was a
necessary service, and once [Brennan] got
the results, he realized that it was. Instead
of continuing the leasing, he decided to
shift the existing shuttle schedule around,

consolidating routes that weren’t very
necessary,” said Jay Gervasoni, SGB
member. .

In other business the SGB addressed a
continuing problem with cleaning services
in four of the student-residence halls.

In past years maids would come in
every week to clean the bathrooms in
Bruce, Brackenridge, McCormick and
Amos Halls. Two summers ago, according
to Felgoise, the maid service was done

away with and changed to other services.

“lNow] they clean the hallways and the
stairways every day to make the outside
of the suites look more presentable. So
they take the maids who would normally
be cleaning the bathrooms away for those
duties,” said Felgoise.

“Right away last year it caused a pretty
big uproar, and right away there was a
petition with 500 or 600 signatures. It was

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, October 15, 1990

 

Homecoming

Continued from page 1
“Initially when I came, I hadn't
expected to participate because,
as you can see, I'm not quite
dressed, and neither is Dr.
Posvar,” said Harmon, who wore
a suit and a pair of dress shoes.
“But, in the interest of good,
wholesome, clean fun, I gave it
my all; I gave it my all. It's a fun
activity. I'll be more appropriately
dressed next year." _
The 13 teams that participated
in the competition may have
arrived with clean sweatpants, T-
shirts and sneakers, but once the
games were over, they left with
patches of mud on their clothing,
whipped cream in their hair and
some cracked eggs on their faces.
Troy Lehman, who was one of
the members representing the
Absolute Webster team, said, “I
kind of wish it wasn't so muddy,
but actually I think that makes it
kind of fun. You get more dirty.”
Senior Robert Kathary, also on
the Absolute Webster team, said,
“The competition is a little messy
and a lot of fun, but we're a

bunch of seniors, so this is what
we do instead of study. We blew
off classes to practice for the egg
and cake competition, so it's like
a piece a cake because we’ve
been practicing all week."

The four-member teams took
about three" minutes each to
complete the competition. The
game involved Player 1 pushing
a blue keg with a broom to Player
2. Player 1 was shaved using
whipped cream by Player 2. Then
Player I threw three whipped
cream pies into a garbage bag
worn by Player 2.

Afterwards, Player 2 ran over
to Player 3, who searched wildly
for a balloon hidden in Player 2’s
garbage bag. Player 3 put the
balloon between his/her legs
and ran over to the jump rope.

Placing the balloon on the
ground, Player 3 then had to
jump rope seven times. Then 5/
he went over to a bucket ﬁlled
with whipped cream and eggs.
Player 5 had to pick three eggs
out of the bucket and throw them
into another bucket on top of

Player 4’s head.

Then Player 4 got into a sack
and hopped to reach a bat near
the end of the obstacle course.
Player 4 then placed the top of
the bat on the grass and bent over
to place the bottom of the bat on
his/her forehead and spun around
the bat 12 times. Finally, Player 4
rolled the last keg with a broom
to the finish line.

Bradd Devello, a team member
of Spoons and Forks, felt
disoriented after he completed
his 12 revolutions around the bat.

“That is the toughest part of the
obstacle course — there is no
doubt about it,” said Devello,

Stacy Roth, a sophomore and
member of Alpha Epsilon Phi
sorority, did not find it as easy to
complete the bat spinning. In the
middle of spinning her knees hit
the ground, and she laid her head
on the grass.

“That is definitely not the easiest
part of the game,” said Roth after
she was able to stand without
leaning to one side. “I did go
around for about six times,

though, but I couldn’t get off of
the ground after that.”

Students who watched the
event from the sidelines thought
that the competition may have
been more exciting to watch than
it was to participate in.

Marcy Lightfoot, a senior and a
member of Sigma Sigma Sigma
sorority, said she thought the
competition was hysterical.

“I love it. I think it is so funny,
especially when they do that bat
thing. I was just standing here
thinking that I’m glad I don't
have to do that, but if I did, I
would like to catch the eggs on
my head,” said Lightfoot. _

According to. New Student
Programs, the winners of the
Keg Roll/Anything Goes
competition, there was no
possible way anyone could have
stayed pretty in those events.

“The competition is really dirty.
I stink, and I smell sour," said_l.R.
Fisher.

“I was in the Pie Pants event,
and I had a garbage bag around

unmentionables.”

Laser Show and Fireworks

They weren’t unidentiﬁed
objects that Pitt students were
watching Friday night between
the Cathedral of Learning and
the William Pitt Union.

The streaks of green rays that
were bounced off mirrors located
on the Cathedral and on trees on
the Bigelow Boulevard side of
the union were part of a laser
show. This year was the first time
the show was added to
homecoming festivities by the
Pitt Program Council.

While music was played from
the union, ﬁgures of ﬂying birds,
circles and spinning globes were
projected on the trees.

Freshman Susanna Kodlick said
that the laser show was very well
done.

“It was really great. There is
always something going on here,
and this was one of the most
super things. It is one of the
advantages with going to a big
school —— they put on great shows 2

for you,” said Kodlick.

The laser show was held right
before a fireworks display which
was also part of homecoming.
Shawn Eckman, a student at Pitt,
said the ﬁreworks were not like
anything that he had imagined.

“I was surprised. I didn’t think
that it would behalf as good as

it was," said Eckman.

The laser show and fireworks
display lasted for about half an
hour, as students stood on
Bigelow Boulevard, underneath
the laser rays and listened to the
theme song from the movie
Chariots of Fire. -

Junior Brian Holmes said, “It
was great; I liked it. The laser

show was a neat idea; I would

have liked to see more images,
but I think that they did a great
job, just for a half-hour display."

Alumnus Mark Merlin said he
came to campus just to see the
laser show.

“This was the most exciting
year that I have ever seen at Pitt
because of the laser show."

King and Queen Crowned

The moment had finally arrived
during halftime of the Panthers’
football game Saturday.

The 10 homecoming —court
candidates waited patiently on
the field to find out who was
going to be crowned this year's
homecoming king and queen.

After the names of the winners

were announced over the
loudspeaker, Pitt President
Wesley Posvar placed the crowns
on the heads of Franzjobson and
Lisa Tate.

As Tate was given a dozen
roses, Jobson escorted her into a
blue Sunbird LE. The winning
candidates waved to the cheering
crowd as they were driven around
the football ﬁeld.

“I was just astonished and
surprised. I'm glad that - Franz
Uobson] was there because he
was a good, stable person, and I
was holding on to him the whole
time. I was thinking, ‘Please don’t
let me fall,”’ Tate said in between
hugs and congratulations from
Pitt students. “It was very time-
consuming, but it has paid off
more than I could ever imagine.
This is just the most incredible
feeling.”

“ It hasn’t sunk in yet  maybe
tomorrow [it will]. The
homecoming event has been even
more worthwhile now because I
got something very wonderful
out of it. I had a good time,”

Jobson said.

given to Bob Robinson,
who happens to be the
assistant administrator in
the housing department.
What that did was create
some concern for the
problem and generate some
meetings. Last semester
Dusty Rhodes handed out
a survey. Six hundred
surveys went out, and 125
came back, and that’s a lot
for a survey. People were
saying that they want this
maid service back,” said

Felgoise.
“Dusty and I went to Dr.
[William] Harmon, vice

president of student affairs,
and told him about the
problem, and he thought it
warranted a meeting,” said
Felgoise.

On Oct. 11, according
to Felgoise, a meeting was
held with Hal Robins, who
is in charge of support
services; Gary Houston,
executive assistant to the
vice president; Robinson
and Resident Student
Association members. It
was decided that the SGB
would have to get more
proof that students wanted
the bathrooms cleaned on
a weekly basis.

“I guess we’re going to
have to go out and do
another survey to prove to
them that the students want
this service.  I think that a
petition with 600 names on
it and a return of 125 surveys
is enough to warrant the
return of the past services,”
said Felgoise.

Shuttle service sustained

Because of the efforts of the Student Government
Board, Pitt students who live in South Oakland finally
have something to cheer about: a way to stay safe.

The public safety department has given its approval for

the South Oakland shuttle. This means that this service

will be a permanent transportation option for students.

Through the efforts of board member Katie Malaspina,
the SGB got students to ride the shuttle, showing that it
was a helpful service for the campus.

Because of this, Public Safety Director William Brennan
decided that the service was necessary. This decision was
one of the best Brennan has made during his tenure. By
doinlgthis, he has partially fulﬁlled one of his goals to help
make South Oakland safer for both students and local
residents.

But applause should also go out to the students who
reside in South Oakland. They realized that this was a
useful service, and they made the most of the opportunity.

With their decision to show Brennan that this is a useful
service that should be kept, students living in South
Oakland will now have a way to avoid the streets not only
to prevent crime but also as a means of transportation
during the cold winter nights. J ‘

As the people of this nation diligently watch NBC all this
month, hoping for a chance to win millions of dollars in
the “McMillions” game, sponsored by McDonald’s, they
also must pay attention to their family trees. _' J

Thelma and Charles Bellows received a game ticket for
T hursday’s pick. That night, when the winning number
was announced, she discovered that she was holding that
number. This meant that she had won $10 million.

. Unfortunately, her daughter works at the McDonald’s
where she received the ticket. Under contest rules,
employees and their families are automatically disqualiﬁed
from any prizes. I

Earlier in the day, Bellows told contest auditors that she
had a daughter working for McDonald’s. At that time they
said that her relation did not matter because the girl did
not live with them. _

Later, this decision was reversed by the higher authorities,
who said that her relationship with their daughter did
make them ineligible. McDonald’s then took back the $10
million they had given to the Bellows.

T hedecision to take away this money should be re-
evaluated. If the auditors of the contest decided that her
daughter’s employment did not matter, then McDonald’s
should stand behind that decision and award the money
to the Bellows family, regardless of the rules.

The Bellows deserve a break today.

Pitt lost chance to gain money

I had an opportunity to speak
with one of the University of
Pittsburgh’s renowned faculty
from the philosophy department
this past summer. Our
conversation led in a direction
which made him claim that
agnostics lacked “moral courage.”
I didn't V agree but was very
intrigued by his statement and
excited to have him elaborate. I
anticipated this gentleman had
done much thinking on the

subject and would provide a_

convincing argument for such a
controversial statement. Needless
to say I was not convinced nor
impressed by his beliefs;
however, the concept of lacking
moral courage persists in my
memory. , Throughout the
remainder of the summer, I
attempted to think of situations
where one would lack moral
courage. I became my ﬁnest
example.

About three weeks ago a staff
writer at The Pitt News asked me
if I would mind sharing with her
my feelings on the university’s
recycling efforts. I was more than
happy to share with her how I
felt and made it clear that I wasn’t
pleased at all with Pitt’s new
program. I insisted that it was not
what one expect from a university
which claims to be first rate.

I speciﬁcally told her that it
was my opinion that the
university was absolutely
lethargic in its recycling efforts.
The reason for this lack of effort
is quite evident. The powers that
be received word that the
university was required to begin
recyclingbyseptember ofthis
year. These people in turn decide
to let facilities management
handle the problem, who in turn
gave the responsibility to
someone under its jurisdiction.
Recycling begins to sound like
the game "hot potato.” Finally
one person receives word that
[he or she] must find a solution to

this problem and hasn’t the power
to pass it on to someone else.
This person who is already
overworked has no desire to put
muchtime into an effective and
responsible recycling plan. He or
she then decides the best thing to
do would be to hire a group from
outside the university to handle
the problem. Therefore, the

Letters

person who seemed to be stuck
with the task is once again able to
make it someone else’s
responsibility. This problem is
now out of everyone’s hands at
the university and now must be a
concern of the waste-disposal
company which received the
recycling contract. They of cou rse
aren't looking to get rid of it,
because this means big money.
If this truly were a first—class
university, it would have taken
the time to see the amazing
amount of opportunity that -was
generated by the recycling law.
Not only has the recycling
program barely started (it’s
October), the student life at Pitt
will play almost no part in the
university’s efforts. It seems to
me an institution of higher
education should involve
everyone in this landmark
legislation. Pitt had a chance to
promote and provide a direct
link to educating people in the
necessity of protecting our fragile
environment from the glut of
waste that now threatens its lands;
instead, most of university life
will not be asked to put an end to
their wasteful habits; the

university will do it for them. The
ancient Chinese proverb comes
to mind about giving a man ﬁsh
and he will eat for a day but if you
show him how to fish he will eat
for a lifetime (assuming the water

I organized

is clean). It seems obvious to me
what the university should be
doing.

The university could have hired
a recycling coordinator supplied
with a staff which would have
been in charge of an appropriate
recycling program that included

students, faculty, etc. This team .

of individuals could have
the method of
separating me garbage, collection
of the materials and ﬁnally,
distribution to buyers of the new
commodity. The money which
they made for the collected

‘materials could have likely paid

the salary of the coordinator and
his/her staff, not to mention the
possibility of leftover funds that
could have been reinvested in
the university (in undergraduate
programs  doubtful). A program
like this could have been an
example for all university’s to
follow. Pitt is so interested in
research——— why was the recycling
law not construed as a potential
research project; instead, it
became a big headache for a few
lazy individuals /whose futile
efforts resulted in a big contract
for a big waste-disposal company.

I told Rebecca Wilkens, the
staff writer who was doing the
article, that students have been
disregarded in a huge university
decision, and once again Pitt lost
focus of the original intent of
higher education.

After I explained the situation
to Robin, I asked that she not use
my name as a source of
information because I am a
peaceful person who does not
like to cause controversy. There

is no better example of someone

who lacked moral courage than
when I told Robin to leave my
name out of her article. .

I've been to the Wizard  hear
my roar.

Pitt victory over Rutgers ends five-week drought

Byscott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

The way his Panthers keep coming in
and out of the lineup, Pitt Coach Paul
Hackett may want to install a revolving
door in the team’s_ locker room.

Last Saturday Darnell Dickerson, Tinker
Harris, Heath Snell, Joe Conlon and Mark
Gunn came in, and out went Hosea Heard,
Curtis Bray, Derrick Lewis and Sean Gilbert
for a variety of reasons, and the Panthers
won their first game in ﬁve weeks, 45-21,
against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights.

“All kinds of roles are changing for this
team; ... It was Mark Gunn’s time today. It
was time for Mark to show he could play,”
said Hackett. “Darnell also stepped to the
front today. He was critical in the offense,
taking the pressure off Olanda lTruittl.”

“And who would have thought a month
ago that Heath Snell would be _our starting
linebacker? Who would have thought a

month ago that Joe Conlon, a wrestler, a
walk-on, would move from defensive end
to fullback and provide three key blocks?
Joe got an opportunity and reached up
and seized it.”

Dickerson got the start because Heard
had been suspended for two games for
violating team rules. Snell replaced Bray,
who is out with a dislocated elbow. Harris
came in after Hackett decided that the
defensive backs needed a fresh face.
Conlon was moved to fullback to replace
Derrick Lewis, who quit the team. And
finally, Gunn replaced Gilbert for a second
time this year after Gilbert sprained a
ligament in a non-contact drill on Thursday.

Since opening day_ the Panther lineup
has undergone more facelifts than -the
entire Gabor family combined. Of the 22
Panther starters against Ohio University,
only 13 held that same title last Saturday.
Patchwork lineups have been one of the

2 reasons for the Panthers’ inconsistent play

over the last month, but after a week off
the Panthers were ready to get back to
work —— no matter who was on the field.

“With two weeks off we got to sit
around and think about how we were
playing, and a lot of us weren’t happy with
how we were playing,” said defensive end
Keith Hamilton.

The game marked the return of the
Panther defense, which had been playing
like it would rather have been studying for
midterms the past month.

Pitt had surrendered 987 rushing yards
in its last three games but limited the
Scarlet Knights to 19 first-half rushing
yards and 93 overall.

Hamilton and linebacker Ricardo
McDonald each registered 3- 1/2 sacks and
combined for 16 tackles.

“I haven’t felt that [good] in a long time,”
said McDonald. “I got tired of saying, ‘I
should’ve done this’ or ‘I should’ve done
that.’ We had to go out and prove that we

could play.”

Pitt held Rutgers scoreless until the third
quarter, when Knights’ Coach Doug Graber
replaced Bill Chesna at quarterback with
Derek McCord. The junior went 11 for 16
with 165 yards and three touchdowns in
his first collegiate action.

“We didn’t even know he was left-
handed until he stepped out onto the
field,” said Hackett. ‘

McCord brought the Knights to within
35-21, but Vernon Lewis blocked a punt
with 8:40 to play, setting up an Alex Van
Pelt one-yard sneak to snuff any hope of
an upset.

PI'I'l‘ BITS: With 238 yards passing Alex
Van Pelt now has 4,191 career yards and
needs 50 to pass Rick T rocano for third
place on Pitt’s all-time passing list 
Conlon replaced Lewis in more ways than
one; he also now wears Lewis’ old No. 26

 Pitt is now 8-0 in the all-time series

Dickerson returns to Panther lineup as receiver  

By Rob Mazur
sum’ Writer

A familiar face to Pitt football

fans returned to the Panther

starting lineup this past Saturday.

However, if you were looking for
junior Darnell Dickerson to be
starting at his position of old, you
would find sophomore phenom
Alex Van Pelt there. Van Pelt

took over the starting quarterback
position last year after Dickerson
was ruled academically ineligible

to play. The rest on that story, as

is said, is history.

But what is this about
Dickerson’s playing? If you
listened closely and actually
watched the game, you would
have discovered Dickerson
starting at ﬂanker.

Dickerson had seen minimal
playing time this season. When
he did come in, usually it was
only to serve as a decoy for a play
or two. He got his second chance
to be a vital cog in the 1990 Pitt
Panther football team on Saturday.

PS U mins on Lady Pomt/9erpama’e;

His chance, however, came at
the expense of a teammate.
Hosea Heard, a chronic
problem case for the Panthers,
was suspended for two games
prior to Saturday’s clash with the
Scarlet Knights for breaking team
rules. Heard has been disciplined
in each of the past three years as
well. His distress became
Dickerson’s opportunity.
Stepping in at ﬂanker, Dickerson
caught three of six Van Pelt
offerings thrown to him. Only
one of these three counted on the
stat sheet because of two holding
penalties. _
Dickerson’s play was not
flawless either. He misjudged a
long pass in the first quarter which
would have sustained the opening
drive for the Panthers. Dickerson
admits he still has something to

learn. “It’s been hard to learn this »

position,” said Dickerson. “It takes
a lot of running and learning the

-routes. I think I’m finally getting

to where I need to be.”
See Dickerson, page 10

game was more competitive, but
Penn State won handily, 15-5.

only .089, compared to .272 for
Penn State.]oAnn Elwell (15 kills,3
digs), Leanne King (16 kills, seven
digs), and Michelle Jaworski (14
digs, 41 assists) gave Pitt the most
problems.

‘‘[It was] The adrenaline of the
first game, and the tough way it
ended.” said Coach Sue Woodstra
when asked what happened to
the team after the first game.
“That call at the end of the first
game [bothered us]. I have no
complaint,butyou justdon’tmake
a call like that on game point.”

“Our passing broke down, and
we weren’t quite as emotional or
intense,” Lantagne said of the last
two games, “We tried to keep it at

team’s injury problems, but said,
“I don’t want to take anything
away from Penn State.
Offensively, they are very strong.
They just don’t make errors.”

The Lady Panthers had
extended their winning streak to
nine earlier this weekend by
pounding Villanova and
Georgetown. They defeated
Villanova in three straight games,
15-5, 15-2, 15-9, on Friday, and
then traveled to Georgetown
Saturday to beat the Hoyas in
four games, 15-13, 15-2, 12-15,
15-13.

Susan Zonneville led the team
this weekend with 26 kills in 41
attempts and had only 5 errors.

success with a total of 22 kills.

With a record crowd on hand
for the Pitt—UConn soccer game,
Pitt Stadium was still 55,997 seats
shy of a sell-out. In a must~win

‘situation, the Panthers battled the

Big East's No. 2—ranked Huskies
to a 0-0 tie in front of S03 excited
fans.

Both teams began play in
defensive modes, volleying the
ball back and forth without many
scoring chances. Pitt midﬁelder

Mike Saunders exchanged shots
on goal but were both denied by
the opposing goalkeepers. With
21:52 left in the first half, senior
Roberto Croce sent a pass to
sophomore j.R. Perdue. Perdue’s
shot narrowly missed the goal as
it was deﬂected wide by Husky
goalie Tom Foley. With a little
over five minutes left in the first
half, the UConn offense burst
forward and pressured Pitt into a
one-on-one situation. Luckily for
Pitt, the shot went wide.

Pitt junior defenseman Brian
Pelligrino saved the game. In a
brilliant heads—up play, Pelligrino
stopped the Huskies in an almost
guaranteed goal-scoring
opportunity.

With 17:50 left in the second
half, UConn midfielder Corey
T urnage blasted a shot which
was deflected by the diving Pitt
goalkeeper, Jay Kapusta.

However, a UConn forward
kicked the ball toward the empty
net. Pelligrino made a save worthy
of a highlight ﬁlm, kicking the

ball away and preserving the tie.

Early in the second overtime,
Kapusta and Husky forward Rob
Lindell collided at the 18-yard
line, and both went down hard.
Lindell was carried off the field
while Kapusta made two
outstanding saves, leading his

Continued from page 8

Dickerson has found some of
the new job responsibilities
challenging as» well. “It’s been
tough. While there isn’t much
difference in reading coverages
from a quarterback to a wide
receiver, you have to block a lot
when you play receiver. I never
had to do this when I played
quarterback. ”’

“I’ve never

caught passes

V before; I’ve just thrown them.”

' While Dickerson may have had
his problems at his new spot in
the lineup, he also showed great
promise. The three passes he
caught were on three different
types of routes.

“I’m not really frustrated about
the catches thatwere called back.

I’m happy I caught one that
counted and that I’m playing
football again,” said Dickerson.

“I just can’t say enough about
Darnell Dickerson,” said Coach
Paul Hackett. “He gives us a
whole new dimension. Now all
we need to do is get the ball in his
hands and let him do the things
he used to do at quarterback.”

Dickerson’s playing flanker
does indeed increase the Panthers’
offensive potential. Those that
remember his days at quarterback
will remember his quickness and
rocket arm. This gives the
Panthers a quick receiver to not
only keep drives alive but also to
gain substantial portions of
yardage in a crunch.

more opportunities, too. With
more than one dangerous receiver
to contend with, opposing
secondaries can no longer afford
excessive coverage of Truitt. This
extension of the defense was
shown in the game with Rutgers.
With Dickerson to worry about,
the secondary was burned by
T mitt for 87 yards on three catches
and two touchdowns, one a 45-
yard strike.

“With Dickerson and T mitt we
have two guys who can play with
each other for another year and a
half,” said Hackett. “Plus, we have
[Chris] Bouyer and [Junior] Green
as well. I think our receivers are
finally fitting together.” With
Heard coming back for the Notre
Dame game, the Panthers will
have a deep arsenal to choose
from against the Irish.

During his interview Dickerson
never brought up the subject of
going back to play quarterback.
The possibility of returning to his
field-general role was not ruled
out.

“Darnell is definitely an
offensive threat. If we get the ball
in his hands, who knows what he
can do? Also, his playing at
receiver does not preclude the
possibility of him playing some
at quarterback,” said Hackett.

kills in the two matches.

“It was a pretty tough
weekend, with a lot of
traveling,” said Lantagne
before the Penn State game.
“We had to drive to Villanova,
then drive to Georgetown.
Under the circumstances I
think we played pretty well
considering we had to hurry
back to play Penn State.”

The team continues its nine
game home stand on
Wednesday with its third
meeting with Duke this
season. Pitt won the two
previous meetings in three
games each. The Lady
Panthers then play Big East
rivals Boston College‘ Friday
and Providence on Saturday.

A LOOK BACK...

History shows Pittsburgh
and Providence as the only
two squads to have won team
championships in the Big East.
Pitt has won four while
Providence follows with three
team championships to its
credit since the Big East's
inception in 1982.
