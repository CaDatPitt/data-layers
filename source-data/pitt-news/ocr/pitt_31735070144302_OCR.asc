E-mail changes affect security

by Alie Gensheimer
Staff WrL'ter

Pitt students, faculty and staff
need to make a minor adjustment
to security settings if they want
to continue third—party e—mail cli-
ents, like Microsoft Outlook or
Thunderbird.

Last semester, representa-
tives from Computing Services
and System Development’ sent
an e—mail saying that they were
“enhancing the security of the
University’s IMAP e—mail envi-
ronment on Nov. 22, 2008  You
must make these changes prior
to Nov. 22, 2008, so that you can
continue to use your e—mail client
with the University’s IMAP e—mail
service.”

Individuals who received this
e—mail could follow links and in-
structions in their e—mails to make
any necessary changes.

CSSD director Jinx Walton
said, “Prior to the change, secure
connections to IMAP were pos-
sible, but optional. The change
put into place makes secure con-
nections mandatory.”

Security changes protect the
usernames and passwords o‘f
those who use third—party clients,
said Walton.

If people who use third—party
clients don’t make the proper
changes, it’s possible that “some-
one could intercept a person’s
username and password as they
are sent from the user’s computer
to the IMAP system,” she said.

The changes in the security
system encrypt information. This
is beneﬁcial because if e—mails are
intercepted, they are unreadable
and unusable, said Walton.

-Walton said that all students,
faculty and staff who use third-
party e—mail clients should have
received an e—mail about the se-
curity changes, but some students
who do use third—party e—mail cli-
ents said that they never received
the message.

Jake Kastrenakes, a sopho-
more who connects to his Pitt
e—mail using Mac Mail, said, “I
never got the e—mail, but I’m still
able to receive messages without
problems.”

The e—mail sent out included

links speciﬁc to each third—party
client with step—by—step instruc-
tions explaining how users could
conﬁgure their e—mail services.
It also included a link with help
sheets.

The changes affect only those
who use the IMAP mail system
and have programs on their per-
sonal computers such as Thun-
derbird, Outlook and Mac Mail,
said’ Jinx Walton, director of

Computing Services and Systems _

Development.

“Only 8,000 University af-
filiates use this particular system,”
said Walton. “So, only these peo-
ple receivedthe e—mail.”

Several students said they don’t

use IMAP and therefore weren’t‘

affected by these changes.

Another student, Drea Cham-
berlain, said she has her e—mail
forwarded to a Yahoo account.

People who access their e—mail
using Webmail or UNIX Time-
sharing Service PINE don’t need
to worry about security changes,
as CSSD has already put security
in place.

Soldiers & Sailors Military Mu-

admission to everyone during Jan-

The museum’s president, Ron
Gancas, said in a press conference,
“During these economic times, ev-
ery citizen is made to be more fru-
gal with their spending. We want
to make sure that they still have
a cultural place to Visit. Not only
will they learn about American his-
tory through artifacts and art, they
will take with them the stories of
Americans who sacriﬁced, some-

times everything, to protect our "

country and freedom.”

Gancas requested that museum
Visitors make a donation to the
museum’s Memorial Garden Proj-
ect. The museum plans to place
on its lawn a life—size monument
in honor of today’s members of
the military, as well as benches and
paths.

Pitt's Scantron ‘machine

by Lori Stover
Stat/]l‘" l«l’7rite/'

Hidden on the ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral

’ of Learning, a machine exists that determines the

fate of many students each semester.

Except for a small  the large metal doors
of - the office that holds the machine might _seern,
to a passerby, to lead to a closet or perhaps to a
secret passage Even the loud  of the nu-
chine cannot penetrate the walls of the oﬁice and
drift into the hallway.

Each Scantron test astudent takes at Pitt must
pass through this machine

- Nancy Reilly, the director of the Ofﬁce I of
Measurement and Evaluation of Teaching, has
supervised this process for years ‘

“We’ve never lost anything,” said 

In a norrnalweek, Reilly said, the ofﬁce handles
about '90 orders During ﬁnalsiweek, however, that
numbercanriseias  l30orders

During ﬁnals week’ for fall semester, ﬁve people
had the respon'sibility for processing the sheets

 the machine does most of the work.
When it’s in good condition, it can handle 6,000
Smntron sheets per hour or 100 sheets per min-
ute; ' I _ _

On Dec 12, however, the machine gave the
staﬂ some trouble '

iWhen this happens, Elaine Rubinstein, who
works in the Office of Measurement and Evalu-
ation of Teaching, tries a few nicks. Armed with
a bottle of dusting spray, Rubinstein attempted
to ooaxti1emachinebackintowod<ing,butthe
sheets continued to pause midway through rim-
ning under the scanner. I .

 or tries alittle “sweet talk.”

“Now, you" should be on your good behavior.

There are people watching,” said Rubinstein to the
machine ,

The ofﬁce itself seems to run even more ef-
ﬁciently than the machine on which it depends
No one there said they could remember ever los-
ing any tests, and the ofﬁce workers keep all of the
tests they receive organized  labeled folders

(Typically, either the professor or a teachers as-
sistant drops off the tests’ After  them
of]; the person receives a card with a number on it,
which he can use to retrieve the graded tests This
process is designed to keep students from having
contact with their tests In the absence of the card,

When the oﬁice returns the tests, it also includes _

gives instructors a number that measures the dif-
ﬁculty of the test.

In addition to  Scantron tests, the oﬁice
handles teacher evaluations The oﬂice has worked
together with each school at Pitt‘, except for the
School of Law, to create these evaluations

Because the office must complete most of
these toward‘ the end of the semester, these evalu-
ations create even more work for the office in an

Sister cities ‘date’
before pairing up

by Estelle Tran
Amtzltta/zf Newa Editor

Being a sister city is like being in a mar-
riage, and Pittsburgh has a lot of love to
give. "

Pittsburgh formalized a relationship with
the Vietnamese city of Da Nang, its 16th
sister city, at a signing ceremony last month
in the City Council Chambers.

“This is another kind of exchange pro-
gram. It builds a long—term relationship. It’s
likea marriage because these cities are joined
forever,” said Patrick Madden, president and
CEO of Sister Cities International.

Aside from the common goals of cul-

tural, educational and economic exchange _

between any two sister cities, Pittsburgh of-
ﬁcials have other expectations for the initia-
tive with Da Nang.

City Council president Doug Shields said
he is hopeful that the formal relationship

with Da Nang will reinvigorate old bonds.

with other sister cities, which were hard to
maintain during Pittsburgh’s economic trials
in 2003.

“One of the issues here in the city of
Pittsburgh is money. Part of the sister city

' relationship program is there is an exchange

of business,” said Shields. “We still don’t
have the kind of funding to support it.”
Both Shields and Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl attended the signing ceremony that
solidiﬁed Pittsburgh’s relationship with the

. fourth most populous city in the Socialist

Republic of Vietnam. There will be a similar
ceremony in Da N ang next month.

Before the two cities become sister cit-
ies, Madden said that they should “date.”
Though this is usually done through eco-
nomic investments, it was a charitable group
in Pittsburgh called the Friends of Da Nang
that took interest in building schools and
facilities in Da Nang, a city that used to be
an important U.S.  base (See related
story about the Friends of Da Nang).

Pittsburgh already has "a small presence
in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Bernt
Reitan, executive vice president of the Pitts-
burgh—based company Alcoa Inc., signed an
agreement in June with a Vietnamese min-
ing company concerning a bauxite mine and
alumina reﬁnery in the Dak Nong province,
which does not contain Da Nang, said Al-
coa Inc. spokesman Kevin Lowery.

Dr. Thach Hong Nguyen, the ec_onorn'ic
counselor at the embassy of the Social-

ist Republic of Vietnam who attended the

signing .ceremony, could not be reached for

comment.

Many of Pittsburgh’s sister cities deal
with the steel and mineral industries, and be-
cause of this kinship, representatives from
Pittsburgh and its sister cities can have valu-
able talks about moving the cities forward,
said Shields.

The Slovakian steel city, Presov, is one of
Pittsburgh’s sister cities. South of Presov is
the largest ﬂat-rolled steel producer in Cen-
tral Europe, U.S. Steel Kosice.

U.S. Steel operates out of Pittsburgh,
even though Pittsburgh is no longer the
great steel city it was during World War II.
Pittsburgh, however, still holds the reputa-
tion as the “Steel City.” That might be why
it is a natural partner to its steel—producing
sister cities: Bilbao, Spain; Ostrava, Czech
Republic; Wuhan, China; and Sheffield,
England.

Shields said that the relationship with
Shefﬁeld holds particular value.

“Sheffield is another steel town,” said
Shields. “We went through this. There were
a lot of discussions about economic devel-
opment, managing environmental condi-
tions and government building.”

Phil Roberts, the director of strategy
and corporate services at Creative Shefﬁeld
Limited, said that both Pittsburgh and Shef-
ﬁeld endured a restructuring of the steel
industry in the last 30 years. After a series
of new investments, both cities can now of-

fer aerospace, medical technologies, creative

and digital industries and environmental ex-
pertise.

Sister cities started by Eisenhower

Sister Cities International is an organiza-
tion based in Washington, D.C., that began
in 1956, when President Dwight D. Eisen-
hower recognized the need to promote cul-
tural. understanding among people around
the world, without bureaucrats getting in the
way, said Madden.

Now there are about 2,300 sister cities in
135 countries. Madden said there’s no limit
on thenumber of sisters a city can have.
However, he encourages leaders to work
within their means.

' Sometimes when a city does not havevthe
resources to maintain its sister cities, rela-
tionships go dormant, like they did in Pitts-

vburgh in 2003. There are other occasions

when industries and priorities change or
there are political disagreements that cause
participants to cut “forever” short.

“Just like a marriage, they can go down,”

Da Nang one of

said Madden. “\We do have a
mechanism for divorce, but we
don’t want to promote that.”

Sister Cities International is the
only organization that certiﬁes sis-
ter cities. For two cities to become
sister cities with each other, lead-
ers from both cities must sign an
agreement. ‘

However, the cities determine
the level of involvement. Cities
might just host musical groups,
provide scholarships for students
to travel abroad or send consul-

tants to help analyze problems

with water systems.

Cities pay annual dues based on
their population, not the number
of initiatives. The dues range from
$150 to $1,960, and Pittsburgh,
with an esginated population of
about 311,218, pays $1,190 annu-
ally in dues, said Laura Giroux, the
membership manager of Sister
Cities International.

Chicago has thriving programs
with 27 sister cities. The smallest

population to have a sister city is
the town of Gilbert, Ark., with a
population of 32. Its sister city is
in the United Kingdom, said Mad-
den.

Pittsburgh’s other sister cities
are Soﬁa, Bulgaria; Zagreb, Croa-
tia; Matanzas, Cuba; Saarbrucken,
Germany; Saitama, Japan; Skopje,
Macedonia; San Isidro, Nicaragua;
Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay;

Donetsk, Ukraine; and Karrniel-

Misgav, Israel.

Shields said that Pittsburgh
does not have a sister city in Africa
and has expressed interest in an

‘alliance with Kampala, the capital

of Uganda. He said he applauds
the missionary work that has been
done in Kampala and the humani-
tarian work of the Friends of Da
Nang.

“Rather than be a deﬁcit in the
world equation,” said Shields, “it’d
be good to be a contributor and
give support to people who are
doing the right thing there.”

Friends build bridge in Vietnam

by Estelle Tran
Aadiata/zt New E9itor .

After the Vietnam War, Tony_

Accamando, like many other
American veterans, traveled back
to the Socialist Republic of Viet-
nam to see the country post—war.

“In 1997, [a friend and 1]
went back to Vietnam just to
see it, just to see the country at

peace and not at war,” said A’c- .

camando. “When we were there,
we saw this thatched roof, dilapi-
dated school. And we thought
this is pathetic. So, we thought
we should try to build a school.”

On Veterans. Day in 1998,
they began a campaign to build a
school in Da Nang, the location
of the U.S. military base where
Accamando was stationed.

Other people in the area took
interest in their project, and to-
gether they formed the Friends
of Da Nang.

The Friends of Da Nangheld‘
‘ numerous fundraisers, raising

$50,000. And the next year, on
Veterans Day, it opened‘ an el-

ementary school in Da Nang.
After it accomplished its goal,

the Friends of Da Nang decided’

to build another school. And an-
other. And another. ,
The organization built the
elementary school, seven kinder-
gartens, a bridge that connects
poor villages during monsoon
season and a medical clinic,

' . which opened in 2002.

The group also started a
program called Let Them Walk
Again, Da Nang. This program
has helped 1,000 Vietnamese
children who were born with
birth defects caused by Agent
Orange or lost limbs by stepping

on land mines left over from the ,
war‘ by offering them therapy, ,

operations and prosthetic limbs.

Since its beginning, the friends .

of Da Nang has raised nearly
$500,000 through fundraising

breakfasts, jewelry sales and din— '

ners with Vietnamese food, said
Accamando.

T Accamando said the Friends
of Da Nang consists of about
50 members. About 20 people

attend the group’s monthly
meetings. He added that many
veterans in the group are just in-
terested in the charitable efforts.
“We have no overhead — 100
percent of every donation that’s
given goes to the projects. That’s
appealing for donors. Any ad-

’ rninistrative costs are covered by

donors,” he said.

The group has been pushing
Pittsburgh to become sister cities
with Da Nang for several years,
and members of the Friends .of

Da Nang attended the signing V

ceremony in December.

Accamando, who graduated
from Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Affairs in 1971, said that
he believes the U.S. military and
its allies were in Vietnam to halt
the spreading of communism
and to help the Vietnamese peo-
ple. ‘ ‘‘

“So, for all these years I have
felt that the mission wasn’t com-
pleted ‘and maybe I wanted to do
somethingto help the country,”

said Accamando. “I believe I am
still continuingithe mission.”

Located in the heart

by Becky Reiser
("if Pit:‘t"s campus!

Staff Wrder

Almost everyone saw them —~ the stu-
dents following crowds down the sidewalk,
asking groups to register to vote, the adver-
tisements for President-elect Barack Obama
written in chalk on the Litchﬁeld Towers’
patio that seemed to appear overnight, ta-
bles set up around the citywith hope para-
phernalia and volunteers ready to persuade
passersby to vote Democrat.

A few Pitt students felt especially com-
pelled to dedicate their work to the cam-
paign. They were so dedicated, they decided
to take a semester off from classes to work
full-time for the Obama campaign.

Robin Lane, a Pitt sophomore from St.
Louis, Mo., said she has supported Obama
since the primaries.

“I wanted to directly affect something,
fix all the country’s problems,” said Lane.
She said she felt like she was making that
impact as a summer volunteer. “It was cool
to be involved with so many young people;
that’s what hooked me.”

“I learned that the biggest issue was not
about Obama. It was strong, motivated peo-
ple standing up to do something,” said Lane,
echoing the familiar “change” motto that
was so familiar during the campaign.

Robin was a field organizer on the first
ground team in Missouri. Beginning in May,
her duties included registering voters, mak-
ing phone calls to potential supporters and
going door-to—door to distribute literature.

As the summer progressed, Lane started
to hone leadership skills that later aided her
in her position last fall. V

“There were originally ﬁve of us,” said
Lane. “The others were older campaigners,
and they asked me if I was interested in tak-
ing a semester of .”

The answer, said Lane, was a no-brainer
because she “had so much invested at that
point.”

While other students were stressed about
classes, Lane said she was stressed about
planning rallies in St. Louis and meeting for-
mer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Vice President—elect Joe Biden, Obama and
their families. ' I I

The months didn’t pass without a few all-
nighters. Lane said that one of her favorite
‘_ J I 3 A M '  memories revolves around the night before
i ' ii 3 ' the St. Louis kickoff party for Obama.

“We came tovm.y house to make a map
and list of people [to distribute ﬂiers], and
we worked until 3 a.m., then fell asleep on
my basement ﬂoor,” said Lane. “The next

day we got up and worked again all day. It
was awesome.”

Instead of sprinting down Forbes Av-
enue after Obama’s victory, Lane was at the
Chase Hotel in St. Louis with her family, co-
workers and volunteers.

“After my job became paid and full-time,

my parents supported me,” said Lane. “My
dad even knocked on doors with the other
volunteers.”

Although she doesn’t plan on majoring in
political science, Lane said she is interested
in learning more about the government and
has decided to take her first class about it
this semester. Lane said she’s also interested
in interning in \Y/ashington, D.C.

“I’m only 19, but I learned to manage
other people. I learned tools and skills dur-
ing this campaign,” said Lane. “I would deﬁ-
nitely do it again.”

Lane will return to Pitt this semester. She
said she hopes to graduate on time, with the
class of 2011.

Lane wasn’t alone

Pitt senior Sarah Posner, a political sci-
ence and international studies major, also
worked for Obama’s campaign, forgoing a
semester of college.

“For me it was less a question of wheth-
er I could afford taking a semester off of
school to work for the campaign and more
a question of if I had the opportunity, how
could I pass it up and not devote all of my
energy to a cause that I was more passion-
ate about than anything else in my life,” said
Posner in an e-mail. '

“The sense of urgency was too strong to

V ignore.”
Posner, who served as president of Pitt »

Students for Obama, helped the campaign in
the primaries. During ﬁnals week last spring,
she volunteered in Indiana and West Virginia
for their primaries. She then received an of-
fer to work full—time in Indiana, North Da-
kota and Virginia but decided to stay ‘close
to home, working full—time in Pennsylvania,
a “guaranteed battleground state.”

“My experience working for the cam-
paign was undoubtedly the best experience
of my life,” said Posner. “It was absolutely
worth it to miss one semester of school, be-
cause I was a part of something truly spe-
cial.”

Posner met numerous celebrities, such
as actors Deirdre Hall, Kal Penn and Dan

Rooney, the band Rusted Root and the

Obamas.

But not all of her experiences were as
pleasant.

ences, which mainly involved en—
countering racism during the pri-
mary and general election,” said
Posner. “It really saddened me to
see that racism was still prevalent
in our country, and I was disap-
pointed that Obama’s race seemed
to be such an obstacle to him be-
ing elected president.”

Posner said her favorite mem-
ory is seeing a woman at a “Get
Out the Vote” event the week-
end before the election holding a
sign that read, “Rosa sat so Mar-
tin could walk. Martin walked so
Obama could run. Obama is run—
ning so our children can ﬂy.”

“Seeing this put tears in my
eyes and rejuvenated me for the fi-
nal stretch of the campaign,” said
Posner.

Posner said she plans to seek
a job in Washington, DC, after
graduation.

Professors
nominated

for award

Three Pitt professors have been
nominated for awards for excel-
lence in teaching online courses.

Pitt School of Information Sci-
ence professors Mary Kay Biagi—
ni, Bernadette Callery and Ellen
Gay Detlefsen were among seven
people nominated for the 2008
awards for “Excellence in Online
Teaching, Best Practices.”

The Web—based Information
Science Education consortium,
an organization that works to un-
prove the quality of online educa-
tion, sponsors the awards, which
will be given out at the Annual
Conference of the Association
of Library and Information Sci-
ence Education in Denver later
this month.

The professors were nominat-
ed by students who took online
courses but do not attend Pitt.

Students, guards say they'd prefer a faster system

the new SGB is committed to improving student

“We are open to dialogue with Residence Life

he said

Security guard Gail McWhorter said, as she

likes the schools current policy, “but at certain
times, it’s a littie extreme.”

day of  break as parents were bring-
ing students back.

“[The sign—in policy] is time—consuming after
the holidays when you have your parents and
grandparents helping you move in with groceries
and everything,” said Mc\Y/hotter: “It would be
great if they could wear the wristbands like they
do during move—in. We need to have something

She calls Sundays “food days” Signing in par-

Powers is among the students who like to see
the process speed up

“I don’t think you should have to  in other

single dorm in Tower C, so she spends a lot of
time with her ﬁiends in the more spacious Ruskin
apartments.

“I don’t see why they can’t just check to make
sure that Pitt students aren’t on the [persona non

Powers

’ Mc\X/hotter agreed -

“Maybe another ID-card reader that checks to

called it her “Christmas list”

Another issue is weekend guests Mc\X/horter

“There needs to be weekend guest passes ——
something that they could wear,” she said ‘That

“Other than that, I like the procedures,” said
McWhorter ‘‘In case there is something damaged

In addition to the guest sign~in guidelines,
Pitt has also recendy installed computerized lock-

. May Democratic primary.

ed from Mt. Lebanon High School and the
Community College of Allegheny County.
He later enrolled in Pitt’s College of Gen-
eral Studies to pursue a degree in public ad-
ministration. . 0

‘‘I’ve always wanted to go to Pitt, be-
cause Pitt plays such an important part in
Pittsburgh,” said Frank. “The education is
of great value. And Pitt has a great reputa-

-tion around the country as being an excel-

lent educational institution.”
At Pitt, Frank wrote for The Pitt News

and served as vice president of the College _

of General Studies’ student government
board. He was actively involved in Univer-
sity Democrats at Pitt and once drove a
motorcade with both former President Bill
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.

With the University Democrats, Frank
also worked with mayoral and senate cam-
paigns, along with voteriregistration.

“But the motorcade was probably the

stores with Nabiscb products to boycott,”
said Frank.

He then worked as an administrative

assistant for former city councilman Gene
Ricciardi. In 2004, he became a volunteer
coordinator for the Young Voter Alliance,
which worked to increase youth turnout.
i Frank said his management helped the
alliance increase the turnout of Oakland
area voters ages 18 to 35. Some say this
helped then—presidential ‘candidate john
Kerry win Pennsylvania.

“We would knock on doors and say
where the candidates stood on the issues,”
said Frank. “The.No. 1 reason young peo-
ple say that they don’t vote is that they don’t
know enough about the candidates or the
issues. We would educate them and empow-
er them so they felt like they had enough
information to make a decision.”

“That’s what I’m -doing on my cam-
paign,” he added.

Frank said keeping young people in
Pittsburgh is a major "challenge. He said he

"‘I love where I come from, and I think
it’s about time that people get involved and
stop sitting on the sidelines,” said Schubert.

Schubert said he believes his experience
working as the city’s zoning code adminis-

to be a successful city councilman.

“As you can see, the city’s issues are right
in my background,” he said. “I’m working
on improving the city every day already.”

Schubert said that, if elected, he would
concentrate on the economy.

Schubert added, “We need to evaluate
taxes on a case—by—case basis and ﬁgure out
how we can getipeople to believe in Pitts-
burgh government again.”

Schubert said he began working on cam-
paigns when he was in high school.

“I worked with my dad, who was a trial
lawyer, with grassroots campaigns and also
helped several state legislators become
elected,” said Schubert.‘

When he was in college, he became a
member of Pitt’s College Democrats and
Judicial Board. Both experiences, he said,
have led him to where he is today. ‘

But he said his classes and professors in-
spired him even more.

“I loved my history of the European

said Schubert. “The subject didn’t particu-

know Professor Hagerty and found out that

he had worked in politics in \Washington,

D.C., for 20 years, which really encouraged
my political aspirations.”

Schubert said that Hagerty introduced
him to politicians working in Pittsburgh

whom he now has friendships.

Another of Schubert’s professors, Nello

“W/hile Brendan was in my class, he was

definitely one of my better students, and

Hillman should move

A month or so from now,
when the lull between the be-
ginning of the semester and
midterms ends, stressed-out
students will ﬂood Hillman Li-
brary to toil on papers, projects
and rnidterms undl it closes at 2
a.m.

We often joke that no seri-
ous studiers enter what’s com-

 monly known as “Club Hill-

man,” a nickname attributed to
the more social atmosphere of
Hillman’s ﬁrst ﬂoor during the
library’s peak evening hours.
But as the night continues,
Hillman transforms into a ha-
ven for academically minded
students, many of whom will
continue studying well past the
building’s closing time.
Though Pitt maintains some
24-hour operations —— the Ca-

thedral of Learning and Da-i

vid Lawrence computer lab, as
well as residence hall lounges
— for students wishing to con-
tinue their studying late into
the night, it has not joined the
growing number of colleges
nationwide that boast 24-hour
libraries on campus.
All-nighters are not a new

 occurrence on college campus-
.,. .
es, but college hbraries have be-

gun to switch to 24-hour opera-
tions during the week in order
to stay relevant in an age when
students can access most study

_ U materials online. In the Inter-

net age, the college library is
no longer the go—to source for
study and research materials. _
Instead, it has morphed into
a quiet area for students to

.l,, work without the distractions

of roommates, television and,
most importantly, sleep.

This fall, Carnegie Mel-
lon University’s Hunt Library
began to experiment with a

rr. 24-hour operation, keeping its

basement and ﬁrst ﬂoor open
during the week.

, to 24-hour operation

When the university ob-
served twice its target number
of students working in the li-

,brary overnight,’ it decided to

make the hours permanent.
Other colleges. that maintain

24-hour libraries during the‘

week include Villanova Univer-
sity, Penn State University, MIT,

the University‘ of Virginia, the‘
University of Illinois and the

University of California at Da-
vis, according to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. »

‘While Pitt does offer. a few
24-hour study spots on cam-

"pus, making Hillman a 24-hour

library would provide a central
location on campus for stu-
dents wishing to study later
than 2 a.m. Pitt has traditionally
kept Hillman open for 24 hours
during final exams with much
success. '

Permanently transition-

*ing its operations to 24 hours

would require maintaining the
finals week structure during the
entire semester.

Rather than operating the
David Lawrence computer lab,
which offers no table study
space, for 24 hours, the Uni-
versity could instead close the
David Lawrence lab earlier and
maintain its 24-hour operations
at the Hillman computer» lab.

One possible objection _to
moving Hillman toward 24-
hour operations might be the
difficulty of staffing a build-

ing as large as Hillman for 24

hours. '

Keeping Hillman open 24
hours ‘would require staffing
additional computer lab, library
and security attendants, which
would no doubt cost the Uni-

" versity more money.

, Though cost is a drawback,
it seems a small trade-off for
the beneﬁts of having a central

campus location for all-night_

studying.

Pan flute mockery a disease of ignorance

by Lewis Lel1e
Colum/zidt

 

We need to be on the lookout
for echo chamber effects. You
know what I mean: You start
hearing people say" something,
and because everyone is saying
it, you start saying it without veri-

fying the source. Some folks say

that’s how the subprime crisis got
started.

Something similar is happen-
ing  the comedy world. It has

' become subtle andinsightful hu-
mor to make "fun of Peruvian pan

ﬂute bands.
The first time I‘ encountered
the trend was in David Sedaris’

new book, -“When You Are En-

gulfed’ in Flames.” He remarks
how there are Peruvian pan ﬂute
bands all over the world, annoying
people. 1 read this and thought,
“That is so true!” I thought Da-

vid Sedaris was really onto_some—

thing. ' .

' Later, my friend who works at
NPR told me about editing sto-
ries about Andean farmers for a

globalissues show. She and her -

coworkers were expressly banned,
in a memo, from using Peruvian
pan ﬂute music. On getting the
memo, everyone laughed_ and

said, “Thank God! That stuff is
so annoying.”

Then, the TV show South
Park_ came out with not one but
two episodes dedicated to a Peru-
vian pan ﬂute epidemic. The pe.
ruvians were out of control,,an-

noying people around the world. 1

When this phenomenon was used
to justify a government conspir-
acy that involved quarantining all
the Peruvian pan ﬂute players, the
fictional .American public agreed
blindly. Meanwhile, life imitated
art. , -

My roommates and I laughed.
We talked about how when we
were traveling, the Peruvian pan
ﬂute bands were everywhere-and
they were all annoying. We all
had a Peruvian pan ﬂute story to

share. It’s part of being a citizen _

of the world these days, as much
as buying FairTrade and listening
to MIA and losing a bundle in an
emerging markets mutual fund.
For Christmas, I got a copy of
The Onion Atlas. There is an arti-
cle for every country  the world.
With a racing pulse and sweaty

brow, scarcely aware of just what

I was looking for, "I ﬂipped to the
South America section. There,
glaring from under the heading
for Peru, was the introductory
subtitle that unveils the central
comic conceit for each country:

“Always with the Goddamn Pan
Flutes.”

Under the subtitle:

“The former seat of the Inca
Empire is today driven by the joy-
ful, sickening melodies of the pan
ﬂute ...” I -

Where did this epidemic ‘of
pan-ﬂute hating come from? Are
they really annoying us? Have you
been personally annoyed, or was
it just a friend of a friend? It is
time ‘to reverse this echo cham-
ber effect with some cold and in-
disputable facts that no one can
argue. Here are some common
fictions about Peruvian pan ﬂute
bands and some facts to accom-
pany them.

-l. Fiction: They always play Si-
mon and Garfunkel’s “El Condor
Pasa.”

Fact: They hardly ever play
that? song. That song is lame, in
sharp contrast‘to condors, which
are awesome. Peruvians even have
an illegal festival called Yawar Fi-
esta‘—- ‘,‘blood festival,” in Span-
chua — where they tie a condor
to a bull’s back for a light, know-
ing full well the condor will win
by pecking the bull_’s eyes out all
the way to the brains. Having seen
the condor in action against a gi-
ant bull, Peruvians would not ‘dis-
grace the condor by playing such

a lame song.

Home shopping one true constancy in a sea of trashy TV

by Erik Hinton
Colum/ziat

 

My relationship with QVC and
the Home Shopping Network has
always been one of subtle ani-
mosity. Like a pair of mutual ex-
boyfriends, we tolerate each other
when together. Apart, we make bit-
ing remarks about the other’s inan-
ity and doubt that the same person
could love us both. If this conceit
sounds a bit stretched, let me as-
sure you it is only because years of
silent aggression have forged a very
complex hatred between television
merchants and me.

Truthfully, I doubt that they
reciprocate this lukewarm disdain,
but would they ever if they knew
how often I made fun of a host’s
hairline, how frequently I paro-
died their empty ramblings about
camcorders that become decora-
tive chickens or how violently I
criticized their three-hour paeans
to consumerism, which they dare
to call “specials.” No, the good
name of Hinton should rightly be

spat upon and dragged through the
mud by every QVC video jockey
and HSN barker.

The delicate pas—de—deux be-
tween these stations and myself
would carry on just ﬁne were I not
forced to endure so very much QVC
when I came home for holidays.

- My parents do not necessarily enjoy

those plastic—faced trinket hawkers;
home shopping just happens to be
a very neutral background noise
during our fever-pitched board
gatning sessions. When we’re not
gaming, conversation is just that
much easier with a television ﬂick-
ering in the background. QVC is
somewhat like a pastel—colored
digital ﬁreplace distracting our pe-
riphery just enough to smooth over
any gaps  thought or dialogue.

Rather than my normal seeth-
ing, though, I set out over this
break to determine why home
shopping is so popular — not the
act of shopping itself, but why so
many televisions are permanently
tuned to a loop of QVC.

I refuse to believe that the suc-
cess of home shopping might be
linked to the quality or prices of

home—shopping networks’ prod-
ucts. These networks feature offer-
ings such as pre—made chicken and
dumplings that cost $11 in shipping
and handling alone to be  ice-
ferreted to your front door. What
possibly could inspire anyone, even
the most reluctant cook, to order

such a product in lieu of simply’

stepping outside and going to a res-
taurant or calling his local grocer?

Other times I’ve seen QVC
advertise sweaters with hens ap-
pliqued to them.iI grew up in the
backwater of York County, and I
can assure you that rural folk are
every bit as sensible in their fashion
choices when it comes to 
away applique. There is a universal
quorum on the matter.

No, there is something deeper
to home shopping.

QVC and HSN survive because

of something like an, existential
constancy. If one turns on any
other channel, he is likely to find
syndication of shows from years
ago, programming that has long
since jumped the shark or serials
that were never very good to be-
gin with. Television is very much

a muddied collection of pilots and
ﬁnales, special episodes and guest
stars. Struggling to capture the at-
tention of capricious audiences,
networks are forced to court that
coquette Nielsen ‘and his ratings
through elaborate ﬂourishes of
dynamic programming: incessantiy
killing off characters, bringing in
celebrities, plot—twisting the night
away and layering on impenetrable
back story. With most series, if you
miss one episode you might as well
just give it up, as the curve to get
back on is too steep.

However, amid all this com-
motion, home shopping charts a
steady course. The most gradual of
changes in product lines mask the
passage of time. Hosts are retained
for decades. You could set your
watch ‘by the programming. At any
time you can tune in and pick up
right where you left off. You might
have missed a few sterling silver
onyx chokers, but the current is
welcoming — two more hours of
Black Hills Gold.

Furthermore, home shopping
offers a gentle reminder that other
people actually do exist. Most tele-

vision bears no traces of connec-
tion to the outside world other thaii '
a timely reference here and there.
Sure, the news is a much more di-
rect link to civilization, at large, but
it is rarely an index of the vitality of
the world as much as it is a testag,
ment to the new ways people have"
found to die and kill one another.

QVC, however, happily chugs
along, touting human inventive-
ness. “An egg timer shaped like
Barack Obama?” Yes, man hasn’t
lost his touch since ﬁguring out ﬁre
and the wheel. Moreover, folks are
always calling in to talk about their
lives actually improving, saying
things like, “I made my husband
happy for the ﬁrst time in years
with a GPS unit.” I

Home shopping succeeds be-
cause it armounces a happy con-
sistency. Although thoroughly
spineless, QVC and HSN anchor
viewers in a ﬁrm communion with
mankind. It is a fellowship of buy-
ing stuff, but a fellowship neverthe-
less.

Before hating, separate pan ﬂute fact from pan

Lehe, page 22

2. Fiction: They never play The
Beatles’ “Obla Di-Obla Da.”

Fact: They actually play that
song as often as you might believe
they’d play “El Condor Pasa.”
“Obla Di Obla Da” is a great
song that you like.

3. Fiction: Peruvian pan ﬂute
bands are everywhere.

Fact: There are not that many
Peruvian pan ﬂute bands, and def-
initely not enough to base an_ “Is
it just me or ...P” joke on, which

is the kind of humor that makes '

you laugh when someone points
out this  that is really com-
mon but that no one thought to
talk about, like if you said, “It’s so
awkward when you say goodbye
to someone but then it turns out
y’all are walking in the same direc-
tion.” Everyone who travels has
probably heard two Peruvian pan

C ﬂute bands. So sorry! Gently weep

me a damn river, backpackers.
4. Fiction: You do not like Pe-

ruvian pan ﬂute music.

Fact: You like Peruvian pan
ﬂute music. The pan ﬂute’s pil-
lowy tones cradle the ear in a
hammock of harmony, a salt bath
for the soul. The music is uplift-
ing, calming and somehow vague-
ly ancestral for all the world’s
peoples. Peruvian pan ﬂutes stir
up visions of Druid ancestors,
riding alpacas over the Andes,
harvesting nutmeg for a solstice
with Elijah and some ‘samurai and

Sufjan Stevens.

5. Fiction: Pan ﬂuteimusic is
the only music of the Peruvian
people.

Fact: Peruvians also have this
type of music called Huayno —
pronounced like “wino.” Huayno
is awesome. It is the blues of the
Andes —— the musicians are of-
ten drunk and always yelling with
their cousins on the recordings,
and the songs are about pretty
girls who run around or have to

flute fiction

leave the old homestead for the
big city life. As much as you adore
Peruvian pan ﬂute music, you will
like Huayno better.

i The next time you hear some-
one ripping on Peruvian pan ﬂute
bands, remember this colurI1n‘{"'
Then, give the column to him be-
cause you printed out some cop-
ies just in case. Only the facts can
put an end to the vicious cycle.

If convicted, Blago will join legacy of Illinois corruption

 
    

by Mark Kozlowski

Co/um/zidt

It was more than a triﬂe em-
barrassing to have my home state
‘-"thrust into the house of national
consciousness at 6 a.m. Central
Time. Even more depressing is
the realization that scandal is not
so unusual so as to be unheard of.
The only unusual end to this story
is that the governor accused of
corruption was publicly humili-
ated.

If convicted, Gov. Rod
Blagojevich, D—Ill., or “Bleeping
Blago,” would be the second con-

Qsecutive Illinois governor to go to
federal prison. George Ryan, who
preceded him in this dubiously es-
teemed ofﬁce, is currently serving
time in the federal penitentiary in
Terra Haute, Ind., and is seeking
a pardon from President Bush.

Ryan’s “conviction stemmed from '

numerous accusations of graft.
Most odious of these was a scan-
dal from when Ryan served as Il-

linois Secretary of State. In return
for donations, this ofﬁce granted
commercial drivers’ licenses to
some who had no business hold-
ing them, with unfortunate and, in
one case at least, tragic results.

It would be convenient to
gloss over these two individuals
as somehow aberrant. It would
be similarly convenient to wonder
if the federal prosecutor, Patrick
Fitzgerald, made a mistake. How-
ever, there is a larger culture of
corruption in this state that makes
almost anything sound plausible
and likely

Chicago has had some aston-
ishing allegations of corruption in
city government. Nineteen—year—
old building inspectors. Trucks
hired to do nothing. Afﬁrmative—
action contracts given to white-
owned ﬁrms. High—level indict-
ments in the water department.
The stories sound fantastic to any-
body not a native of Cook, Lake,
McHenry, Kane,~DuPage and Will
counties. However, to the more
than 6 million residents who live

in these counties, this is politics as
usual. C

It has been politics as usual for
a long time, too. The city was built
on pork twice-over — once from
the meatpacking houses and once
from the pork-barrel. Johnny Pow-
ers, a notorious Chicago alderman
of the 19th Ward on the West
Side, was known as a “boodler,”
or an expert at securing bribes and
similar consideration in return for
government favors.

Oddly, he sounded remarkably ‘

like Blagojevich when facing an in-
vestigation: “I will show thepress
that unwarranted attacks cannot
be made upon an innocent man 
I defy the world to prove I have
ever done a serious wrong.” This
ﬁery quote ran in The New York
Times of Jan. 9, 1898, in an article
bemoaning the “Corruption With
Which Chicago Is Larded.”

So, what happens next?
Blagojevich has decided to ﬁght
the charges, and his lawyer, Ed-
ward Genson, has been running
around Springﬁeld proclaiming

just how innocent his client is.
The General Assembly, however,
is probably not going to wait for
a conviction in federal court and
might move to impeach the gov-
ernor following its re-assembly on
Jan. 6.

Talk of impeachment is not
new in Springﬁeld, and some citi-
zens of the state wanted a recall
amendment to be added to the

- constitution for the express pur-

pose of removing the governor.
However, the programs intended
to remove the governor have been
blocked by one of Blagojevich’s
few friends in the Assembly: Sen-
ate President Emil Jones Jr. In-
deed, it is interesting to wonder if
House Speaker Michael Madigan’s
reluctance to open impeachment
proceedings had anything to do
with the difﬁculty of obtaining a
conviction of the governor in the
Senate. With Jones retiring, this
logjarni is removed.

Meanwhile, anyone ‘vaguely
associated with government has
tried to distance himself from the

governor. Lisa Madigan, daughter
of the Speaker, has been particu-
larly strident, and as attorney gen-
eral of the state she has attempted
to have Blagojevich declared inca-
pacitated by the Illinois Supreme
Court. This sort of toughness
from the attorney general’s ofﬁce

' is probably nothing more than a

- \\

large display for political purpos-
es. '

How much of a difference
will this chaos make to the Illinois
political scene? It’s hard to‘ say. If
Patrick Fitzgerald remains the U.S.
attorney in the Obama adminis-
tration, we will probably see more
indictments and convictions of
inﬂuential politicians. However,
Fitzgerald’s future might not be
certain, and, if the history of Il-
linois is any indicator, the “Illinois
Combine,” as the graft—ridden sys-
tem is called, will likely survive this
investigation and roll on to more
golden times.

Locals LoveBettie look to the national stage

by Sarah Sirnkin
Staﬂ W/riter

Everything from the president

_ to the year itself is new, so why not

a new sound for the alternative rock
scene?
The Pittsburgh—based band Love-
Bettie is ready to step up. ‘
“I would say our music is rock
with a bluesy, soulful, edgy kind of
Hair to it. There’s pop in there, too,”

said Alexandra Naples, the group’s
lead singer and pianist, about the
band’s sound. “Our songs are our
own style, our own ﬂavor, our own
thing. But at the same time, we want
them to be memorable”

And ll7e’re N ever Coming Back, the
band’s debut album, takes its title
from the chorus of the main track,
"The \World is Falling” The album
was released on Nov 26 and will be

‘available for purchase on iTunes,

Rhapsody and Amazon in early]anu—
39’-

Band members expressed pride in
their ability to blend with any group,
a major asset when planning shows
with a variety of other groups. Love-
Bettie has opened for national acts,
including Lifehouse and Ingram Hill.
Guitarist and vocalist C.T. Fields put
it this way: ‘‘\We aren’t punk, we aren’t

meta]. We’re whatever we want to be.

We like it that way.”

But being indescribable can be a‘

caveat as much as an asset at times.

“It’s so hard for even us to de-
scribe our sound. We’re excited to see
what everyone else has to say,” said
Fields.

And now LoveBettie is on the
brink of going from a regional act to
one with national recognition.

Courtesy LoveBettie

“We kind of feel like we’re at the
lifting off point, and we don’t ever
want to come back to sort of where
we are now,” said Naples, referring to
the album’s title \

Since  on the regional
scene in early 2005, LoveBettie
has performed frequently at lo-
cal venues and has been gener-

- ally well received not only by starry-

A The 88 missing a few

January 5, 2009

keys on Not Only

by Alison Smyth
Staﬁ’ Writer‘

Not Only  But Also

88

Island Records
Rocks like: Kaiser Chiefs, Snow -V
Patrol 8

 

With music that’s fairly
popular in the entertain-
ment industry, ‘one would
think The 88 could meet
its own standards on an
entire album.

The 88 brings its L.A. inﬂuence to its
newest album, N02‘ Onﬁi  But/1/so. The
three—person grouphas been around since
2003, but The 88 is more likely known by
its songs featured on reality and enter—
tainment shows, including “The O.C.”
and “Grey’s Anatomy,” rather than by its
name. ' '

Producing under a new label and in-
sisting that nothing has changed, The

 

88’s newest album has a few moments of '

glory, but somehow its catchy tunes only
result in a dull overall tone.

Right from the beginning the band has
bad luck. “Go Go G0” was a terrible pick
to start the show —— the song is whiney

‘ and barely understandable, with music

and vocals that painfully clash. “Love You

' Anytime” is, well, just like it sounds.-It’s a

tribute to a girlfriend.

Luckily, the album isn’t completely lost
-—— there’s a hint of progress beginning by
the third track. ,

“Coming Home” ﬁnally hits the sweet
notes, quite literally. The 88 found its bal-

ance at this point. The Vocals are in har-
mony with a guitar and drum-driven song
that goes along the lines of, “Send me a
letter / Pick up the phone / Make me feel
better / Don’t leave me alone / Because
I’m feeling sick / Honey, please come
quick?’ Use this as a siren’s call on your
long—distance girlfriends or boyfriends
and see how they respond.

‘Immediately after is a melodic piano
addition to the guitar and drums, and the
jewel of a track “No One Here” show-
cases vocal skills. You know how you feel
after anonmutual break—up — that no
one could love your ex as much as you?
Here’s the song for you — slow, gorgeous
and lamenting: “But there’s no one here
who loves you like I do / And thank God
this much is true.”

Unfortunately, after this, The 88 goes
back to its fast track style —— it’s too fast
to understand entirely, but it’s perfect for
head banging and fast dance moves.

The track titled “It’s A Lot,” with its
repeating chords lulling my ears to bore-
dom, says it all. It’s a lot of the same. In
the end, The 88 ﬁts a classic mold in that
it focuses on love. No amount of catchy
drum and guitar with decent vocals can
make up for hearing about one single
thing repeatedly. '

Just like 90 percent of other bands
around the nation, it’s a semi—different
perspective of the same thing.

I lived a Hollywood celebrity relation-
ship storylinei with Not‘ 0725/  But A/so
—— there were a couple moments worth
enjoying, but otherwise I found myself

disappointed and unsatisﬁed. I guess it’s _

time to move on to the next option, L.A.

style. '

For Jews on Christmas, it's all about rice

Jews and Chinese food have a
long, delicious history

by Marc Schutzbank I
Staff W//‘ite/'

" Christmas is one of the best times of
the year, no matter your religion.

After the presents are bought, most
families put away their wallets and go home
together. They sit around the fire, relaxing
and enjoying one another’s company. After
about 10 minutes of that, the eggnog comes
out during one of Uncle George’s onerous
and long-winded speeches about walking
to school in the snow, without shoes, uphill
both ways.

Jews, on the other hand, have a little
plum wine at their local Chinese restaurant.

There are two traditions in my family on
Christmas. First, because Santa is a nondis-
criminatory gift—giver, he dutifully comes to
my house every year, bringing the new socks
that I need and, on occasion, a deodorant
stick with a thinly Veiled hint to use it. Sec-
ond, when Christmas comes to town, my
family goes out for Chinese —— along with

seemingly every other Jew in the world.

When Jews first came to the United
States, the melting pot hadn’t quite melted.
Jewish neighborhoods coincided with Little
Italy and Chinatown. Italian food, with its
blatant combinations of meat and cheese,
was out of reach for many Jews. Chinese
food, on the other hand, far from being as
porky asit is now, was often vegetarian. Lo
Mein never included shrimp, just vegetables
— meat is an American addition. Jewish
immigrants dined in Chinatown not only
because it was cheap, but also because it was
a safe place in an often hostile world. It was
a relationship based on need.

Now, the symbiotic relationship is so
strong that many Jews cannot live more
than a 20—minute drive from good Chinese.
We just cannot survive. However, in today’s
world, where Jews live and work in all parts
of society, Chinese food is no longer a sta-
ple of necessity, but rather one of love.

Chinese restaurants are open ori
Christmas, but which are the best?

by Marc Schutzbank
Staﬁ’ W/liter

Chinese take—out has its benefits. It’s
fast, cheap and easy.

Finding great Chinese food, though,
is not an easy task. It requires a certain
know—how and a lot of scouting. Yet, once
found, a great Chinese restaurant is the
perfect date, a place with great food and
a casual atmosphere or a place to meet up
with your friends after a movie.

If .you’re in the mood for Chinese,

check out these questions that you can ask‘

yourself before entering. They’ll help you
find a great Chinese restaurant:

1. , No English, right? Chinese
people frequent great Chinese food res-
taurants. Your ﬁrst line of defense against
bad Chinese is making sure that there are
Chinese patrons. The wait staff and own-
ers of the restaurant should also be Chi-
nese. The atrnosphere of the restaurant

should feel foreign. If people ﬂuent in any
of the Chinese dialects are munching on
Peking duck, you know you’re in the right
place.

2. Are there ducks hanging from
the window? Pittsburgh, unfortunately,
is unable to step up on this front, but it
is an important note if you’re traveling to
more Chinese—food friendly cities. Ducks
hanging upside-down in the window sym-
bolize that the food is fresh and that the
restaurant is legitimate. This might gross
you out. That’s just part of the fun.

3. Are they open on all tradition-
al American holidays — Christmas,
Thanksgiving and New Year’s? Good
Chinese food operates on a different cal-
endar. Like the Jews, the Chinese use a lu-
nar calendar. The Chinese New Year, one
of the most important Chinese holidays,
is a two—week celebration. This next year,

rant's cuisine is a staple for American Jews at Christmas tirne.

Jews and lo mein: a

Christmas Food, page 27

rector of Jewish Student Life, explained,
‘‘[We eat] Chinese food pretty regularly. It’s
not that unusual to do it on Christmas —
we do it all the time, but on Christmas, it is
tradition.” ‘

During Christmas time, when families _

are inside watching the snow fall, eating
Christmas cookies and spending time to-
gether, Jews are out celebrating the festival
of immediate seating. Long lines are for the
rest of the year, but on Christmas, theonly
people in the movie theater are the Cohens
from up the street and the Rosenblatts "from
Sunday school. i ' J

The Jewish community moves out of
the synagogue and into Chinese restaurants.
Junior Amanda Cohen went out this past
Christmas Eve. “We saw a lot of people
that we know. You know, the Jewish com-
munity is only so big, so even if _ you don’t
know that one person, chances are that you
both have a mutual friend.” It’s six degrees
of separation. .

No lines for movies, no lines for»Chinese
food —— the only two places open for Jews
to patronize. '

So, after seeing the '. latest Christmas
movie matin_ee,Jews gather up their_kin and
get down to dumplin’ town.

For a lot of Jews, getting on your mu shu
is easy. Get on the subway and head down

to Canal Street in New York City, or head -.

to any other major city’s Chinatown. Yet,

should always include some sort
of whole ﬁsh. And yes, when I
say whole, I mean the head, gills,

eyes, everything. A great ﬁshy

dish signals that your restaurant
knows what it is doing. Fish is
not an easy dish to prepare, and
if they can get this one right,
you’ve found your place.

5. Dim sum, anyone?

dumpling meal is very difficult.

waiters travel around your table,

dim sum is that you can sit down
with about eight of your friends
and share the whole meal. It’s
inexpensive, and you get a wide
variety of dishes.

6. Forks, knives, no way.
Chinese food is not eaten with a
fork — it’s eaten with chopsticks.
Although many restaurants can
and will accommodate guests
whose ﬁngers are not so nimble,
the restaurant should have chop-
sticks already at the table. This
signals that most of the restau-
rant’s patrons are Chinese—food

nese food around. These are only
guidelines to ﬁnding a great res-
taurant. If you are unsure, don’t
fret, call some of your Jewish
friends — they canhelp you ﬁnd
the best Chinese food in town.

dard rock audiences but by groups other ‘for them to our parents’ and grandparents’

than the demographics one might expect

Band members attribute this wide success to
the fact that they are not part of a niche band.
In LoveBettie’s biography on its Web site, the
band describes itself as both “marketable and
original,” a balance that’s difficult tostiike.

“It takes a lot of effort,” said Fields. “We
blend so many styles into one — our style re-
ally ranges from song to song. I think that’s
what gives us a really wide fan range, everyone

friends.”
Though all four members —— Naples,
Fields, Banks and Matt Sharrow — originally

hail from the Greensburg area, the band is now I

based in Pittsburgh.

“Pittsburgh is a tough [music] scene,’~’ said
drummer Banks. “There aren’t a lot of venues,
but at the same time there are a lot of people
here starting in the music industry right now I

think that kind of works with the general Pitts-
burgh scene, the hardworking mentality.”

Naples explained the story behind a band
name even more puzzling to decipher than
most

“We had a name for almost a year before we
realized that it had a national tie and we couldn’t
use it,” she said. “Sowe had a bunch of friends
come over one night, threw a bunch of words
ir1 a hat and picked out combinations.”

LoVeBetlie was the unlikely winner because
the musicians “wanted something fun and
good—natured, but something you couldn’t tie
down to a specific genre,” said Fields. “Some-

times we still think, ‘Oh God, what did we pick
that for?’ A name can be so cool and so stupid
at the same time. You have no idea how hard it
is to pick a band name!”

But of the many such challenges a new band
might have to struggle with, gender stigma has
not been among them. LoVeBettie  .per—
formed several shows with female bands tour-
ing the area, including the Hell on Heels tour.

“Believe it or not, I’d say being female-
fronted has helped us,” said Fields. “_It’s ironic

. because a lot of people think this is a male-

dominated industry, but it’s definitely not.”

' LoVeBettie is currently focusing on publi-
cizing its album, released by its own indie label,
Syrnbiosonic Records, and pushing for major
record label representation. The band looks for-
ward to planning an East Coast tour for 2009.

Naples said of playing live concerts, “For
me, the best part is when you see that everyone
is singing the words with you. When we’re play-
ing a show, and the crowd is really into it with
us, it’s like this magic happens. All the stresses
and worries just melt away. It’s like, ‘This is what
I love, this is why I’m doing this?”

Pitt women’s basketball coach Agnus Ber-

Brawl victory at the same time on Sunday, as the
Panthers opened up Big East play at home with a
72-63 win over rival West Virginia (10-3, 0-1 Big
East).

The win was the closest for the No. 19 Pan-
thers (11-2, 1-0), who were  wins by
36.7 points

“It’s 100 wins for Pittsbuigh,” said Berenato
“Sixyears agowhenwe came,we didn’t have 100
people here, literally Needless to say, we didn’t
have agreatteam, butwe believedin each other
and in this University” _

The story of the game for Pitt was senior
guard Shavonte Zellous But that didn’t come un-
til the second half

West Virginia and senior guard Takisha Gran-
berry started off the game’s scoiing, driving the
scoreto6—0inthe ﬁrsttwominutes. Pittgotthe
game started with a rebound from freshman
Pepper Wﬂson and the team’s  points from
senior Xenia Stewart, bringing the score to 6-3.

After a foul on West Virginia’s Cynthia Full-
ard, Wilson went 2-of-2 at the line,  the game
at 8.

The teams continued to trade baskets, and the
game stayed close for the remainder of the first
half until Shayla Scott stole the ball and scored
late.irLthe.hal£  Pitt a 33-27 lead --— its big-.

gest of the game. West Virginia fought back, but
Pitt led 34-31 at halftime

The Mountaineers started the sconng in the
second half as well,  a 35-34 lead before
Zellous shot a jumper and a three to help Pitt
back to a 44-42 lead.

West Virginia hung on, despite ﬁve travel-
ing calls and two more 3—pointers ﬁrom Zellous,
 the score at a close 47-45.

The Mountaineers’ Granberry then tied the
game at 47 before Pitt went on a nine-point run
that included 3—pointers from Stewart and-Ta-
neisha Harrison. '

Gianberry ended the Panthers’ streak with a
shot from behind the arc, biinging the score to
57-50. ‘

West Virginia closed the gaptoj at one

point, but Pitt never gave up its  »

“It felt like desperation,” said  “We
just broke down [Zel1ous] is an ujnbelievable
player. She just went off on us”

Zellous ended with 34 points; 28 of which
came in the second half She added four assists
and five rebounds to lead her 

‘The second half is always myhalﬂ’ said Zel-
lous. “I kind of let my team down in the first half,
so coming out of halftime I knew I had to pick
up my game” ‘

Free throws proved to be another deciding
factor in the game, as Pitt went 22-of-28 from the
line, while West Virginia shot 6-of—9;:i

throw off of his back foot many
times to escape the Beavers’ pass
rush. _

Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt
credited Oregon State’s defense
for forcing Pitt into obvious pass-
ing situations, but he also blamed
overall sloppy play. i

“We didn’t protect well enough,
routes weren’t clean, and the ac-
curacy was not what it needed to
be,” said Warmstedt.

No. 18 Pitt (9-4) found itself
in tough third-down situations of-
ten, especially in the second half,
in which it went three-and-out on
six straight drives.

The team was only able .to sus-
tain one drive all day. In the sec-
ond quarter, Pitt had the ball at
the Oregon State 37-yard line but
threw two incompletions on third
and fourth down. Only needing 3
yards for a first down, McCoy did
not get the ball. \

McCoy was not a factor in the
Pitt offense ‘early in the game,

McCoy ﬁnished the contest
with 85 yards on 24 carries.

\While the offense never found
its groove, the defense had one of
its best performances of the sea-
son. "Without Jacquizz or James
Rogers, Oregon State’s best weap-
ons, Pitt held the Beavers to only
a Justin Kahut 44-yard ﬁeld goal
late in the second quarter.

V The Panthers’ defense found it-
self backed up inside its red zone,
but didn’t allow a point. At the end

of the ﬁrst half, Pitt dodged a bul-
let when Beavers tight end John
Reese was ruled out of bounds on
the best touchdown opportunity
of the game. The next play, Pitt
senior linebacker Scott McKil-
lop intercepted Lyle Moevao in
the end zone to end the scoring
threat.

Pitt’s best opportunity for
points came late in the fourth
quarter, when a 57-yard ﬁeld goal
attempt by Conor Lee sailed wide
right with 2:36 left in the game.
On the play, Pitt was faced with a

fourth-and—eight on the Oregon

State 40-yard line.

But the Panthers’ offensive in-
adequacies forced \X/annstedt to
make the decision to kick.

“On fourth-and-eight, I felt
more comfortable kicking a 57-
yard ﬁeld goal,” said Wannstedt.

Pitt backup quarterback Pat
Bostick moved the offense to its
own 49, but he was sacked by
Slade Norris on the ﬁnal play of
the game.

About midway through a the second half on
Saturday, Pitt forward Gilbert Brown left the game

shoulder with Pitt trainers According to Dixon,
though, ifs nothing serious

“They told me he could go back in at the end,
so we almost put him in, but we got that far of a

Brown had nine points and six rebounds in 20

minutes and threw down two momentum-swing-

Withwin oVerHoyas, pat
the team to beat in the nation

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

WASHINGTON - Neariy every Pitt player
talking to the media after the Panthers’ 70-54 win
against Georgetown on Saturday mentioned mak-
ing a statement.

Pitt center Dejuan Blair made his statement
with his ninth doubledouble of the season — dom-
 Georgetown’s Greg Monroe and showing
that even though he might not be the tallest cen-
ter in the league, he could very well be one of the
best

Forwards Sam Young and Tyrell Biggs made
their statements by scoiing 14 points and playing
lockrlown defense But the most important state-
ment came from the team as a whole

A 3-point underdog on the road, Pitt handed
the Hoyas their worst loss at home since 2004 and
plowed through their 29—game home 
streak like it was nothing. It showed that when
there’s a complete team eﬁort, there might not be
too many teams that can compare

That’s exactly what Blair was 

“We showed everybody that we can play in
a tough game with anybody,” said Blair after the
game “Ithinkwecanplaywith anybodyinthe na-
tion” ‘

Pitt will likely jump into the nation’s No 1
slot after No. 1—ranked North Carolina was upset
at home last night by Boston College But Pitt
couldn’t worry about that on Saturday —— it had to
take care of Georgetown

Blaifs 20-point, 17-rebound performance’

came only ﬁve days after Georgetown took down
the No 2-ranked Connecticut Huskies on the
road In that game, the 6-feett—11-inch Monroe
limited Connecticut center Hasheern Thabeet —
a 7—feett—3~inch junior — to only four points and
seven rebounds

Saturdays game showed that Blair, who is four
inches ‘shorter than Monroe, doesn’t care about

  

height. He cares about results.

“Dejuan played his butt off today,’ ’ said Young
“When there’s another big guy who is supposed to
be ranked really   comes to play.’ ’

Blair might have impressed the most, but the
team followed

As a whole, the Panthers outrebounded the
Hoyas 4621. They scored 26 more points in the
paint and never lost energy. Every time George-
town tied the game or made it look close, Pitt
pulled away and made the crowd a non—factor

“We ﬁgured we could come in and outrebound

them by alot,’ ’ said Young, who had eight rebounds A

‘ ‘But we didn’t think it would be by that much.’ ’

Young said he was also impressed with the way 1

that the team continued to apply defensive pressure
throughout the game

‘ ‘Even when we were playing our worst basket-
ball, we always seemed to hold them down untilwe
could be playing our best,” said Young “If we can
continue to play defense like that until our offensive
game kicksin,wecanbegreat”

This game doesn’t make the season for Pitt; But
it’s deﬁnitely a great way to get Big East play 
There will be some tough games in the Big East.
There might be some  and some losses
along theway. But Pitt now has a win it can base
its season off of And there won’t be another team
along the way it’ll be scared of

As faras theBigEastisconcerned,Blairand
the rest of Pittwere tight The Panthers made a
statement to the Big East that they are the team
to beat And aﬁer North Carolina’s loss, Pitt is the
team to beat in the nation. But don’t expect it to
takeiteasythisweekand enjoythewin——orthe
ranking——- too much. i

‘We knowhow good of a team [Georgetown]
is,” said Pitt coach Jamie Dixon ‘We beat a very
good team”

But he’s  the statement made on Satur-
day is a little bit diﬂierent; '

“We’re gettingbettet,’ ’ said Dixon. “That should

be our statemen ”

Strong defenses expose Weak offense

.5 El Paso, page 51

“Never in 100 years did I think it would
end up like this,” said Wannstedt.

Pitt expected to move the ball much
more effectively on the Beaver defense,

. and it also expected that holding Oregon

State to just three points would almost
guarantee a victory.

But the offense could never ﬁnd a
rhythm. The Panthers could not contain
Oregon State’s defensive line and ultimate-

ly couldn’t move the ball down the ﬁeld.
They were forced into long pass plays on
a day when the passing game was nowhere
to be found.

“Going into halftime, I felt like we
could stick with the game plan, but we had
to hit some passes,” said Warms-tedt. “But
we [did not] come up with any big plays.”

Many of Pitt’s players were frustrated
with how the game unfolded. Running back

LeSean McCoy put most of the blame on
himself and his teammates.

“A lot of it today was us,” said McCoy.
“Some of the stuff we’ve done all week we
couldn’t execute. [It was] one of the most
frustrating games I’ve played in.”

Those sentiments were felt on the other
side of the ball as well. Pitt’s defense played
a spectacular game, forcing turnovers and
getting in the face of Beavers quarterback

Lyle Moevao all game. But Big East De-
fensive Player of the Year Scott McKillop
was still critical of the defense.

“It’s upsetting,” said the senior line-
backer. “We didn’t come out in the second
half and set the tone. We left a lot of plays
on the ﬁeld.”

Wannstedt disagreed. He praised both
Pitt’s defense and special teams. Instead,
he was much more critical of the passing
game.

“The defense played great and gave us a
chance,” said Wannstedt.

Starting quarterback Bill Stull played
with a heavy heart after the death of his
grandfather and could not get comfortable
in the pocket all day.

He was taken out in the waning mo-
ments of the fourth quarter. Wannstedt
admitted he might have waited too long to
make the change.

“Maybe I should have done it sooner to
provide a spark,” said Wannstedt.

The quarterback discussion will be the
biggest question mark going into the 2009
season.

For a team that ﬁgures to be in the Big
East race, the Panthers need a passing at-
tack to capture the conference title.

W/annstedt indicated that the starting
quarterback spot could be up for grabs,
with Pat Bostick, Kevan Smith, Greg Cross
and Tino Sunseri ﬁghting to possibly sup-
plant Stull, who will be a senior next year.

“W/e’ve got to play better in the quarter-
back position,” said \‘(/annstedt. “It should
be a fun spring.”

Some players looked at the game in a
more positive light. Linebacker Greg Wil-
liams said the loss would make the team
better.

“We all went out and played hard,” said
\X/illiams. “[The loss] will give more moti-
vation for us in the offseason.”
