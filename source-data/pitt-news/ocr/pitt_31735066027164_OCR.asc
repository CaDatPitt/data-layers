What's wrong wiih Oakland?

By Mary Mares
and Mark Gordon
The Pitt News

(This is the first of a three-part series on
Oakland researched and written by students
in a Pitt journalism class.)

Lia Daly remembers the time her landlord
at her North Oakland apartment was ﬁxing
the plumbing.

“In the process, he put a hole in the wall,”
said Daly, a Pitt psychology major. “When
we asked him to ﬁx it, he said, ‘Don’t worry
about it, it’s summertime.”

To many Pitt students, stories like Da1y’s
are run of the mill around Oakland. The aver-
age Pitt student only lives here for a few
years, but it’s enough time to realize some of
the problems of Oakland. The shortage of
on-campus housing (approximately 1,800

means that many students live in the neigh-

borhoods of Oakland, often in substandard
‘ buildings with relatively high rents.

Housing problems, lack of parking, too
much crime and not enough police officers
were common complaints from an informal
survey recently conducted by a Pitt joumal-
ism class.

Many students complained about housing.

In response to a question asking about the
problems with off-campus housing, one stu-
dent wrote: “Dirt, ﬁlth, general slum condi-
tions in South Oakland.”

“Prices are outrageous,” said another.

Complaints usually focus on landlords.
Some Oakland landlords were among those
who had water in their buildings shut off
recently for non—payment after the Pittsburgh
Water Authority took action against those
who had continuously failed to pay their

water bills.

Jennifer Glathom, a Pitt student who rents
an apartment from Lobos Management in
North Oakland, said her water was recently
shut off for a day.

A representative from Lobos, who would
not give her name, said she did not know
how long the water was shut off, but that it
was an “oversight.”

“It was a mistake, but [the bill] was paid in
full the next day,” she said. J

Another concern was crime. Chuck
Bruder, a junior communications major,
wrote he does not feel safe at Pitt because
“there are too many people not associated
with the university [such as] burns and
gangs.”

A complaint echoed frequently by students
who filled out the questionnaire was that are

not enough police ofﬁcers on the street, or

By Julian N eiser
For The Pitt News

In September of 1995,
Lothrop Hall cafeteria will be
closed and replaced by a fitness
center due to student requests
and an initiative by the Student
Government Board.

A 1,500-signature petition
and a survey sent out to 700 off-
campus and 250 on-campus
students produced a decision to’
open a fitness center on the
lower campus.

“We looked at how we can

ter,” said Leon Haley, vice
chancellor for student and pub-
lic affairs.

Haley said the university
looked at both Lothrop and

locations, but the inefficiency of
the Lothrop facility was the
deciding factor.

Tomorrow, ten students from
the University of Pittsburgh plan
to talk with state legislators in
Harrisburg about topics such as
the school’s budget, and, in the
process, put an end to the myth
that all college students are apa-
thetic Generation Xers.

Those 10 students intent on
making their voices heard are
members of the Governmental
Relations Committee, a part of
the Student Government Board.

They hope to meet tomorrow»

morning with the chairs of the
state government’s appropria-

tions and education committees
and other legislators over break-
fast in Hanisburg and chat about
subjects that concern the majori-
ty of Pitt’s students — particu-
larly, the school’s budget for
next year.

However, changing the bud-
get, or any number of other pro-
grams, isn’t their objective —
making their interest in govem-
ment known is, said Jodi
Leibowitz, a junior and chair of
the Governmental Relations
Committee.

“We’re not trying to change
anything,” she said. f‘We just
want [the state legislators] to
know that Pitt students know

what is going on.”

After breakfast, the committee
members are free to “wander
around” Harrisburg and meet
with the state legislators of their
choice.

They will make appointments
ahead of time with those legisla-
tors that they really want to meet
with, Leibowitz said. But just
dropping by the oﬁice of a state
senator isn’t out of the question,
she added.

The students will seek out leg-
islators that share or oppose their

views, she said, and they will '

attempt to learn the opinions of
their lawmakers better and make

“When someone wants some-
thing on this campus, some-

DeV1tto said his office acted
on the suggestions of SGB.

SGB researched requests by

ties they would want in the pro
posed facility.

in the lower campus,” said SGB
President Julie Crowell. “It’s the
SGB’s responsibility to accom-
modate the students.”

Crowell said a new ad—hoc
committee sponsored by the
SGB is active in improving stu-
dents’ time spent at Pitt.

Students at Lothrop hall were
not speciﬁcally asked about their
opinion of the closing through
the surveys. Haley said this was
to see what the whole Pitt com-
munity wanted.

“This is stupid,” said Jennifer
Sprague, a Lothrop resident.
“They ‘didn’t even tell us that
this was happening. I had to call
Food Services to ﬁnd out after
heating rumors.”

Pitt undergraduate student Jill
Morgan said, “My parents are
upset about the closing and are
questioning it.”

Haley said that notiﬁcation of
the Lothrop closing was in a let-
ter to the students in the April 12
edition of The Pitt News and
parents should be notiﬁed by the
students.

‘_‘The cafeteria should stay in
the dormitory,” said Mary Glass,
grandparent of a Lothrop resi-
dent. “The ﬁtness center would
be nice, but everyone has to
eat.”

DeVitto maintained that the
fitness center will be good for
the whole campus, and Lothrop
students who ﬁnd the cafeteria
closing a hardship could be
offered other living accommo-
dations.

When asked if there was any
other option available, DeVitto
answered, “What other space is
there? We try and do everything
we can to accommodate the stu-

dents of our university.”

Haley speculated that the cost
of opening this facility would be
approximately $75,000 to
$100,000, and the surveys
showed a willingness of students
to pay a small fee for use of the
center.

John O’Leary, resident direc-
tor of Lothrop Hall, said he is
concerned about this decision
because of Pitt’s budget crunch.

“I’m disappointed because the
cafeteria is closing. Very few of
the 703 students in Lothrop
seem to be in favor of the clos-
ing, and some of them want to
move out,” said O’Leary.

O’Leary said some students
specifically live in Lothrop
because of the cafeteria and the
close proximity to Scaife Hall.

Most Lothrop residents are in
health-related ﬁelds, and the pre-
sent Lothrop cafeteria allows
them to goto classes, use the
medical library at Scaife and eat

‘all in one centralized area.

Lothrop resident Stephanie
Scates said her concern is for
cafeteria workers who might
lose their jobs.

“I would use the ﬁtness center

and I usually don’t eat in the‘

cafeteria,” said Scates. “Maybe
if we had more of a food choice,
it would still be in use and the
workers might not lose their
jobs.” '

Managers of the Maniot cafe-
teria would not comment on.the
closing or its impact on the
workers.

“This has been a tough deci-
sion,” said Haley. “But I think it
is clear what the Pitt community
wants as a whole, and this was
the best option we had.”

cheap gasoline in an Indy car, a Pinto could beat it. It’s the

regular software, the speed is downgraded a bit.

So, in order to make the decision, you have to know what
you are looking for. If you want great speed all the time, go
for the Pentium. If you are doing work on software that

°From page 1

they should be more visible.

Surveys indicated that the
assault in January in which
David Orsborn, a junior, was
severely beaten right outside the

Towers, shook students’ sense of

security.

“People can’t feel safe at night
because you can get beat up on
the Towers steps,” one student
wrote.

Police believe the assault was
gang-related. Less then two
weeks later, Pitt Police appre-
hended five suspects for the
crime, a first step toward reassur-
ing students that Oakland is a

safe place.

Director of the Pitt Police
Department Rick Boyd, who
came to Pitt last September, is
trying to change the image that
many have of Oakland. .

“Oakland is not an unsafe
place,” Boyd said. However, he
acknowledges that aspects of
Oakland make it seem that way.
“The biggest problem is that
because of public inebriates,

‘panhandlers, con artists, as well

 
 

as the occasional appearance of
gang kids and the deterioration
of housing and storefronts along
Fifth and Forbes avenues, people
get the perception this is an
‘unsafe’ or ‘seedy’ area. In reali-
ty, it’s not. Our officers must be
visible, so people can feel
secure,” Boyd said.

Heather Harrison, a senior,

suggested two changes to

improve Oakland.

“Van call should go all night,
[and] Pitt cops should know how
to help drunks wander home
[such as] calling van ca1l,”
Harrison wrote in the survey.

Beyond the safety concerns of
students, there are parking and
traffic congestion problems.
Oakland is the third-most con-
gested area in Pennsylvania,
after downtown Pittsburgh and
downtown Philadelphia. Long
lines at campus lots, the six-
block/45-minute commute syn-
drome and harried drivers end-
lessly circling in search of that
elusive 12 x 8—foot space sum up
the parking situation. There are
about 9,000 on-campus spaces,
according to Pitt’s Master Space
Plan — clearly inadequate for
Western Pennsylvania’s largest
employer.

Evelyn Hoey, a sophomore,
put parking at the top of her list
of complaints.

“There aren’t enough parking
spaces. People park on the
streets and block them,” Hoey
said. .

One student summed up the
typical attitude in a response to

.. the survey question of whether

there is adequate parking in
Oakland: “No way.”
, The difficulties caused by per-
mit parking was another con-
cern. “It’s a pain that you need a
parking permit to park in
Oakland — especially if you
have family or friends visiting,”
one student said.

Another complained that

» parked cars “get vandalized or

hit all the time.”
The problems with Oakland

, living voiced by students are

echoed by non-student residents
of the community. Community
groups have long sought to alle-
viate parking problems, and are
concerned with crime and with
the rundown conditions of many
apartment buildings in which
students live, since it affects the
value of their property. In addi-
tion, they. may see the students
themselves as a problem in the

community — a source of
noise, trash and property dam-
age.

However, students and non-
students sharing Oakland agree
that despite the problems, it’s a
community with a great deal to
offer. People who live in
Oakland have fought hard over
the ‘years to preserve their com-
munity, and many students like
living in this diverse urban envi-
ronment.

"They would just like to be able
to get a parking spot.

the way it is today.)

their own opinions known as
well.

Leibowitz said she would like
to see an official from Gov. Tom
Ridge’s office [the secretary of
education, for example] and

' Rep. Thomas Michlovic, a

Democratyfrom Pittsburgh, or
any other representative from
Pittsburgh.

Leibowitz also said she and
her comrades hope to gather the
details of bills “that will concern
Pitt students and pass that infor-
mation on” when they return
from Harrisburg.

During the day, there is a
chance that the students will be

said. It’s happened before. On
Feb. 28, Leibowitz was intro-
duced to the General Assembly
while taking part ' in the

when students accompany legis-
lators around Harrisburg for one
afternoon. Leibowitz was
Michlovic’s companion for that
day.

Hopefully, this trip will help
dispel the myth that all college
students, particularly those at
Pitt, are Generation Xers,
Leibowitz said. -

“I want the legislators to
know that we care as students
and university representatives,”
Leibowitz said. “I want my
voice heard.”

Leibowitz said she despises
the term Generation‘X.

“It makes us seemlike a
bunch of apathetic, low-life stu-
dents who don’t care about our
future. That isn’t true.”

liljaboutrthe-evils of bi-g government? '

Strange beclfellows

Politics makes for strange bedfellows. If anyone had said in
1992 that Republican stalwarts like Bob Dole and Rush
Limbaugh would have been trying to sell America on the
ideas of Democratic presidential candidate Jerry Brown, they
would have been called crazy. Brown himself is probably not
much pleased to see his ideas appropriated by the GOP, but in

the market place of ideas, free enterprise sometimes takes the

form of piracy.

A flat tax rate, under which everyone in the country would
pay the same percentage of his or her income, is the idea that
has been so liberally appropriatedby the Republicans.
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, there are currently
two flat tax proposals under consideration in Washington.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey has submitted a proposal
in which 17 percent of income wouldbe taxed with no ‘deduc-
tions. There would be a personal allowance forindividuals,
and this would be doubled for couplesewith an added deduc-
tion for each dependent child.

Sen; Arlen Specter’s plan sets _a 20 percent tax rate with
deductions for home mortgages and contributions to charity.
Under his plan, four-person households who have under
$25,000 incomes would pay no tax at all. " ‘

While its supporters like to tout that people would save
money and time, this tax is a another attempt to aid the
wealthy at the expense of the population as a whole. This is
clear evidence that those politicians who claim to be helping
the middle class and “the American people” are either lying
(as hard as itis to believe), or their conception of who “the
American people” are is much wealthier than the reality
would indicate.  ‘ _ _ » ~

Jack Kemp, whohas been appointed to lead a GOP com-
mission to .reform :t_he,"tax syste:m,’.was’ quoted in the Post-
Gazette as saying, "‘(7‘)rie°‘thifig’?"‘I Tarn’ adamant about is the tax
code should not be used’ to redistribute wealth. It should be

used toencourage the creation of wealth and jobs and oppor-

tunitytefor people -to escape poverty~.”: Why is ~it;< then, that any-
time the. federal-;go_\gernrnent='zseeks.to :.us-e-:.-s.ome of-ithrose«7t2:ix
dollars for such things as student loan programs, Americorps

« or the summer job program, the GOP stands up and screams

If....the.!wejalthy garner a greater proportion of growth at the

ii ‘expense of society, then they should have to "bear a greater

proportion of thecost for helping to keep the society togeth-

V er. By giving everyone a flat rate tax, the working poor and

middle class will have to pay a disproportionate cost, in both
human and fiscal terms. Part of the ﬂat tax plans would make
capital gains, interest income and dividends all tax free. This
is money which primarily comes from investments which the
average American does not have.

The flat tax is a red herring through which those‘ who? have
money can keep it and avoid contributing a share proportion-
al to what they take from the society.

Views on Singapore too Eurocentric

 

. . e c ently,
 Singapore
 as been

receiving a lot
ofbad press in
. the ' United
States from
conservative
Tony critics such as
' . William Safire.
Dlckensheets Safire, a colum-
nist for The New York Times,
who has been one ;of the loud-
;est~ (‘aird;1nost' -inaccurate): crit-...

 
 
 
  
  

Colummst

'ics  5Si'ngapo1f<e]’go‘yerni ‘-

ment’s “repression of .dissent.”
In a recent column, Safire ’had
this to say about Singapore’s
former Prime Minister, Lee
Kuan Yew: “[He] justifies his
repression of dissent by equat-
ing opposition with crime,
turning his judicial system into
black—robed enforcers of con-
formity. And the money ﬂows
in: He rationalizes his old-fash-
ioned despotism by exalting
the prosperity that comes with
his ruthless enforcement of sta-
bility. His acolytes condemn as
decadent a respect for individ-
ual dignity; they hail their
leader’s claim that Asian cul-
ture prefers putting ‘society’

. first.”

Before one can fully under-
stand the stupidity of this
Eurocentric rhetoric, it is
imperative to comprehend the
short history of Singapore as
well as its cultural and ethnic
composition. Following World
War II, Singapore became a
member of the Malaysian
Federation; in 1959 Lee Kuan
Yew became the prime minis-
ter. By the early 1960s, racial

strife between the majority eth- _
nic Chinese population and the_
minority Malays began to .

threaten the Federation. In
1965, Singapore was thrown

out and became an independent .

nation.

The government and people
of Singapore have never for-
gotten that period of racial

‘strife, and the promotion of

racial harmony has played a
key role in public policy deci-

sions over the past three»



island of 616 square kilometers
located at the ‘tip of the
Malaysian peninsula. With a
population of only around 3
million, Singapore is constant-
ly worried about its security.

The nation’s ethnic/racial‘

make-up is comprised of
Chinese (76 percent), Malays

(15-percent) -and Indians. (7 per- '

CCIID; .  [V , _
The main goal of the govern-

ment durin.g the 1960s was to-
.develop the economy and to:
maintain racial’ harmony. Once ‘T

again, this needs to be put into
historical context. Ethnic
Chinese businessmen have not
been, and still are not, well-
liked throughout Southeast
Asia. They have been extreme-
ly successful in the business
sphere throughout the region
and dominate the banking and‘
financial institutions in
Malaysia and Indonesia. While
this economic success has
turned Singapore into one of
Asia’s “four dragons,” it has
also caused much animosity
with its neighbors.

Singapore’s economic mira-
cle has been accomplished by
the government promoting
individual, responsibility
among the citizens and an
atmosphere of social stability.
For people like Safire to say
that Singapore’s style of politi-
cal system assumes that
“Asians were genetically
designed to kiss the cane”
shows how little he knows
about Asian society. It is just
an undeniable fact that Asians
possess a different view toward
human rights than do most in
the West. Had Safire ever taken

a cultural anthropology» class, I

he would know that ‘this is-1a
phenomenon caused by
culture, not politics!

The fact is that the Singapore
government has done a fabu-
lous job in not only developing
the economy,’ but also main-
taining social stability that has
given nearly all Singaporeans a
good lifestyle. This was done
in spite of the fact that the gov-
ernment only spends 0.5 per-

fare and has no unemployment
benefits. Most Singaporeans
are appalled at the social condi-
tions of Western democracies.
They lookat the United States
as a‘ nation that creates -welfare
slaves and where the streets are
full of crime and drugs. In {a
critique several years ago, Lee
said; ‘fWe should not substitute
 the state for the parents or the

’ family. If you bring a child info

the world in the West, the state
...caters’fo;r him“. That’s danger-
o'iis.” l“:wo'nder'. which countiy
truly respects human dignity
and who really needs to “kiss
the cane?”

While most of Singapore’s
detractors admit that
Singaporeans" have a good
material life, they claim that
these benefits have come at the
expense of most political free-
doms. The Heritage
Foundation has ranked
Singapore very low with
respect to “human rights” or
what it calls the Freedom
House‘ Index. Their scale
ranges from 1, which is high,
to 7, which is low. In 1993, it
gave Singapore a 4 for political
rights and a 5 for civil liberties.

Besides finding the rankings
laughable, I believe that they
are quite telling as to what
many of these organizations
consider to be “civil liberties.”
In Singapore, children can play
in the parks without fear of
being gunned down by rival
gangs in a drug war. women
can walk the streets without
fear of being raped by some
homeless vagrant and Carjack-
ing is nonexistent. Murder is
almost nonexistent in compari-
son to the rate in the United
States. In Singapore there are
two murders for every 100,000
citizens; in Washington, the
rate is 84 per 100,000. Tell me
again who has the civil liber-
ties?

The next time you read a
negative article , about
Singapore, look at the facts and
forget about the rhetoric.

ing heavyweight division. But
don’t get too excited, Tyson is
not all that eager to step back
into the squared circle.

Having signed a deal with
Showtime as its version of a
ringside George Foreman,
Iron Mike spent last week
buying a new mansion and a
few BMWS to fill his drive-

A way.

But peering behind the
fence of the Tyson estates lies
George Foreman, heavy.-
weight champion, eager as a
child to fight Tyson.

“He’s like a turkey on
Thanksgiving, hiding and
ducking,” Foreman said.

Yet Tyson, who remarked
while in jail, “I’m not fighting
a 46 year-old man,” wants
nothing to do with Foreman.

' Now if the grandfather and
the felon were to meet, the
purse could reach a staggering
$100 million, something
Foreman does not want tolet
get away.

“We wouldn’t have to fight
ever again,” the Midas man
stated.

So what’s wrong with
Tyson? Doesn’t he want to
earn an absurd amount of
money?

I think he does, but not if
the path has to run through
Big George. ’

Tyson sees Foreman for
what he is: an old fighter who
was in the right place at the
right time. Foreman has as
much right to hold the title as
Tommy Morrison, and Iron
Mike knows it. The ranks of
the heavyweight division are
so depleted talent wise, Tyson
and Don King know they will
have no problem regaining the
title. But, they’re going to take
their time.

They’re going to fight who
they want, for how much they
want, wherever they want.
And when I say “they,” I
mean King and Tyson.

The path back to the title
and to the color of green,
whichever may come ﬁrst,
lies through the land of

Pitt track and lielcl stomps competition  

Women,
men couple
for 73 first-
place finishes
at home

By Keith Pompey
Special to The Pitt News

Pitt’s track and field teams
were unstoppable, walking
away with 13 first-place fin-
ishes without their top athletes
during the Panther Relays at
Pitt Stadium Saturday.

“It was a good meet,” cap-
tain Wes Alexander said. “On
the overall, we as a team ran
well.

“[This meet] was a tune-up
for the Penn Relays [in two
weeks]. We had a chance to
look at certain events for the
Penn Relays.”

In the men’s' competition,
the one event the Panthers
wanted to glance at was the
shuttle hurdle relay.

Pitt’s shuttle relay team of
Orrel Green, Wes Alexander,
Jon Dixon and Jay Murphy
won the race with a timeof
57.2 seconds.

Drrel Green, part of Pitt's winning shuttle relay team, jumps a hurdle at the Panther Relays.

Alexander, a senior from
Hampton, Va., continued to
shine on the track, placing first
in the 400-meter hurdles.

Alexander’s winning time of
52.15 seconds was his fastest
time of the year.

“Basically, every week I run
faster,” he said. “If I keep on
improving, then I will be right
on pace [to qualify for the
nationals].” '

Alexander wasn’t\ the only
Panther who shined in the
intermediate hurdles. Z

Sophomore Jerel Williams
finished second (52.70) and
Dixon placed fifth (54.68).

Pitt also faired well in the
110-meter hurdles. Murphy, a
one—time Big East champion,
crushed the competition, win-
ning in 14.09 seconds.

Pitt baseball sweeps onnecticut

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

Mark Jackson has seen a lot
of things in his five—year tenure
as Pitt’s head baseball coach,
but never has he seen this. His
baseball team went on the road
to Connecticut this weekend
and swept the Big East three-
game series. _ ,

This is the first time Pitt has
ever swept a Big East series on
the road under Jackson.

“That’s a very rare accom-
plishment,” Jackson said. “It’s

hardly ever done in this confer-

ence. The team played well
overall. It’s really tough to
sweep on the road.” ' -

After winning the first game,
8-3, and the second game, 8-5,
the Panthers, who are now 26-
9, were in jeopardy of dropping
the last game. -

Down 2-1 going into the sev-
enth inning, Pitt erupted for
three runs. With one out, Sam
Crowley got the ball rolling
with a walk. After a UConn
pitching change,'pinch hitter
Jeff Murse followed with
another walk, and leadoff man
Josh Mellor was hit by a pitch,
loading up the bases.

UConn made yet another
pitching move, but again the

attempt was futile. With Kurt A

Womelsdorf at bat, the Husky
pitcher threw a wild pitch,
scoring Crowley and advanc-

ing the other runners.
Womelsdorf followed with a
ground out RBI.

Jason Conti, who went 3-for-
4 for the game, came through
with an RBI single to solidify
Pitt’s three—run outburst on
only one hit.

But UConn roared back with
two runs in the bottom of the

seventh to tie the game. The
game remained tied at four
until the ninth.

Once again Crowley got
things started with a one-out
single. With Crowley on third
and two outs, Mellor stepped to
the plate. With a strong wind
blowing in, Mellor belted a

been forgotten by boxing, which
isn’t entirely boxing’s fault.

The Great Lazy ﬁghter who
has been ducked and left behind
by Foreman was a frequent visi-
tor to the Indiana prison where
Tyson stayed to serve out his
tenn.

Over the course of this time,
the two ﬁghters became good
friends as well as potential rivals
in the ring. Bowe wants a shot at
Tyson, and after a few warm up
bouts, Iron Mike will oblige. -

Because of the hype and
potential earnings surrounding
the re-emergence of Mike
Tyson, the heavyweight title
means even less now than it did
when-Foremanwon it.

As Foreman ﬁghts some guy
named Schultz from Germany in
the next week, Tyson will con-
tinue to organize his personal
life and avoid all matters relating

 Wl1o.everSaid     p
“the best things in life are free”
probably l1ac:l a trust fund,

to Foreman.

With boxing and the heavy-
weight division in the chaotic
style they are in, the title that
once was heralded as the great-
est title of all sports has now
become a phantom title.
Whoever ﬁghts Tyson and
somehow miraculously wins
will be deemed champ. If not by
the associations, then by the
financial rewards.

Foreman’s best bet is to take
the advice of another fonner
champion one year his younger,
Larry Holmes. The Beast from
Easton replied a “hell no” when
asked if he would want to ﬁght
Tyson again. If you recall, Tyson
is the man who took the title
from Holmes back in the ‘80s
and sent him into retirement.

Foremanhas done enough for
boxing as well as for himself.
The man who became a savior
for people going through their
mid-life crisis needs‘ to realize he
is too old, too slow and obvious-
ly not man enough to realize that
Tyson will kill him, literally.

So for all those 40-year-and-
older fans who think they are
living in their 20s vicariously ,
through the jolly fat man, take

"“Jo'sh Mellor has been clutch

hitter Tyler Shantz said.‘ ,

Mike Rohrbach_closed the
bottom of the ninth to seal the
5-4 win. Rohrbach landed the
win, raising his record to 6-3.
He pitched 1 2/3 innings,
allowing only one hit.

, “Mike Rohrbach came in
and did a great job to close the
game and pick up the win,”
Shantz said. ‘ ‘

Starter Gregg Mrochko
pitched 5 2/3 innings, giving
up eight hits, two runs with
four strikeouts.

The Panthers didn’t waste
much time in the second game
getting on the scoreboard.

The Huskies touched up
starter Chris Bean early, as
they scored three runs in the
first, giving up three runs and
three hits —- but the defense
committed two costly errors.

Down 3-1 going into the
second, Pitt bombed UConn
for seven runs. As Husky

pitchers had problems finding
the strike zone, the Panthers’
first four hitters got on. Having
already scored four runs, Jon
DeBernardis spanked a three-
run double to give Pitt an 8-3
lead.

UConn managed two more
runs, but behind reliever
Rohrbach, who pitched the last
3 2/3 innings, the Panthers
three-run cushion was safe.
Rohrbach again picked up the

win by completely shutting .

down the Huskies.

On Friday, the first game of
the series, run production
wasn’t a problem because
Pitt’s ace Tedde Campbell was
on the mound.

Campbell hurled the com-
plete nine, only giving up three
runs on six hits. He struck out
five and walked four. Campbell
upped his record to 8-2. .

“It started off a little rough,”
he said, “the umpires were real
tight. After the fourth, I adjust-
ed and I felt like I pretty much
had the game in hand.”

Campbell, whohas pitched a
team-leading 68 innings with
12 appearances, has deﬁnitely
not been under-used. .

“I guess I got what people
call the ‘rubber arm,”’ he said.

UConn scored one in the first
after Campbell let up a leadoff
single, and followed with a
walk. But Pitt retaliated back
in the second when it scored
four.

DeBernardis and Rob
Garvey led the inning off with
singles. Jeff Murse followed

with a walk, loading up the‘

bases. After a strikeout, Ed
Shaffer walked, forcing home
DeBemardis. Crowley, the next
batter, singled in another.
Mellor capped off the inning
with a fielder’s choice RBI.

UConn scraped a run in the
sixth and another in the ninth.
But Pitt also cashed three more
runs in the seventh to put the
game out of reach. Final score:
Pitt 8, UConn 3.

“We played pretty good
overall,” Jackson said. “We hit
the ball OK, our pitching
wasn’t outstanding, but we
played steady.”

UConn dropped its record to
5-20-l.

Jackson said Pitt’s confi-
dence going into UConn was
attributable to its preceding
doubleheader against
Cleveland State last
Wednesday. In that double-
header the Panthers’ sticks lit
up Cleveland State’s pitchers.
In two games Pitt scored 29
runs while only allowing five.

The Panthers won the first
game 18-1 and the second 11-
4.

After stealing the third game
of the tripleheader against
Seton Hall two weekends ago,
the Panthers are on a six-game
winning streak as they head
into the last leg of their season.
The Big East playoffs are only
a month away.

“Our goal right now is to get
into the Big East playoffs,”
Jackson said. “We just have to
keep doing what we’re doing.”

almost every event.

Pitt swept the intermediate
hurdles with sophomore Angie
Martin, freshman Joetta Purter
and senior Lakeya Smith steal-
ing the top three spots.

Martin’s time of 60—ﬂat gave
her the easy victory, while
Purter (63.25) nipped Smith
(63.87) at the finish for second
place. _

Pitt’s Zenia Ayrton, “the
fastest woman in India,” easily
won the 100 meters with a
time of 11.80. Shawna Hardy
of Lincoln University placed
second with a 12.27.

Ayrton broke the meet and
school record in this event last
year, when she was clocked at
NCAA qualifying time of
11.56.

Other individual first-place
performers for Pitt were Staci
Suggs in the l00—meter hur-
dles (13.7), Gennifer Williams
in the triple jump (37-3.75),
Stacey Anderson in the 5,000
meters (18:27) and Megan
Ferrara in the long jump(l8—
8.75). - .

The Lady Panthers were also
successful in winning the 400-
meter relay, the mile relay, the
shuttle hurdle relay and the
two—mile relay.

Women’s—

°From page 9
She became the school’s all-
time leading scorer and
rebounder. Balich was named
Inland Player of the Year and
was selected to the California
Interscholastic Federation

' Team. She was also the leading

free throw shooter in
California, with an 88.8 percent
mark.

“Alecia comes from apro-
gram where they all shoot the
three, but she has the unique
ability —— at her size — to still
be able to go out to the perime-
ter and make the shot,” Bruce
said. “That’s a need we were
looking to ﬁll on our team.”

Durham averaged 18 points,
seven rebounds and three
assists per game for Sullivan
Junior College last season.
Durham, who played her high
school ball’ at August Martin

High School in Queens, N.Y., .

was a National Junior College
Athletic Association All-
Region selection. She shot 50
percent form the ﬁeld and 43
percent from three-point range,
which was eighth in the nation.
This season Durham’s Sullivan
squad advanced to the NJCAA
Final Four, where it placed
third.

Balich and Durham will join
the Lady Panthers’ other three
recruits who signed during the
early signing period last fall.
Those three early signees are
Kellie Ne1son,’a 5-foot-3 point
guard from Washington
Township High School in
Sewell, N.J., Kortni Webb, a 6-
1 forward from St. Francis
Academy in Baltimore and
Gina Montesano, a 5-9 guard
