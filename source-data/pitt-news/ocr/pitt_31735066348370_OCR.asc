The Senate Organizations and

undergraduate seats-~.currently
chosen through Student Govem-
ment Board [SGB] will be
reassigned. The Committee asked
SGB to relinquish one of its seats
but the proposal was voted down at
a January 9 SGB meeting.

SGB’s decision. “It means General

"M Vfand the Young Socialist Alliance’

.(YSA) ﬁled a written complaint
with the Committee on" Student
Organizations against a new by-law
which went into effect in early
January. , 9 '
The by-law requires all student
groups to f'1le as complete list of ' all
members of their organization. It
also mandates all organizations to
have at least 25 members, an

,ﬁ"'increase in the former ten member

“"19
h--r-\'—(1‘§

requirement. ' .

The complaints were ﬁled with
Loryane Seman, assistant director
of student activities who explained,
“The members of the organizations
do not wish to have their names
made public, the YSA fearing

political reprisals and the GSP ‘

fearing sexual’ discrimination.
“I’ve also received a verbal
complaint from ‘the "Third World
People’s Coalition who also fear
political reprisals, should members
of their organization be known.
“The CSO agreed to look into the

matter at last week’s meeting.‘

Members are now talking to the
groups to determine an alternate
arrangement.” _

The next CSO meeting is tomor-
row at 5:30. The membership
matter will be on the agenda.

YSA member Steffi Brooks ex-
plained why the protest was filed.
"Certain members of YSA are
willing to be open while others are
not. YSA has to protect these
people."

Brooks also disagreed with the
new SG statute increasing the
minimum member requirement for
student organizations from 10 to

3425, calling it “a change from one

arbitrary number to another.
"YSA has cooperated in finding
an alternate method,” said Brooks.
“We've volunteered to give ofﬁ-
cers’ names plus other proof that
YSA is an active organization. All

without Council representation for

six months or a year,” Ham said. _

“The 6,800 SGS students are not
represented through the day school
and we feel that, since there are
two student governments recog-

nized at Pitt, we need some kind of

representation on Council,” SGS
Student Cabinet Agent Debby
Hornbake said.

H The proposal at the last meeting

to grant the SGS seat was made by
out-going SGB« president Mike
Furick.

SGS has attempted to gain
Council representation since 1971
but has never been successful. Any
change in the makeup of Council
will probably require a change in

parties involved‘now have to’ get
together for "a democratic deci-
sion." ‘ x

A spokesperson for GSP explained
their protest. “The main reason we
ask for an exception to this regu-
lation is we feel that GSP members
will be open to harassment. This
will depend’ on how open the list
will be. It’s common knowledge
that gay students are harassed,

‘ even in liberal, surroundings.

few years ago,” the GSP member

Student aid

BY HARRIS LEVY

Students applying for the renew-
al of Pennsylvania Higher Educa-
tion Assistance Agency (PHEAA)
grants ‘for the 1975-76 academic
year will have until May 1,1975 to
file. - i

Over 4,500 Pitt students received
grants totaling $3 million this year,
according to University Student
Aid officer Agnes Allen. .

Seventy thousand dollars renewal
applications for ' the 1975-76 aca-
demic year have been sent ’to
students already holding PHEAA
grants with more applications to be
sent out in February.

The grants of 330 Pitt students
were delayed this year after ‘Gover-
nor Shapp cut the Legislature’s
appropriation for processing an
overdraft from $8.7 million to $4.1
million.

“It appears that the 330 students
whose decision was held up will get
their aid,” said Allen. Statewide,
10,000 students were affected. In
determining who would receive the
amount approved by the governor,

time-consuming process.

University Senate president Frank
Slaughter said enlarging the
Council to accommodate an SGS
Cabinet representative would not
mean positions will have’ to be
created for other schools. “Student
Government encompasses CAS,
Engineering and the other schools
but really does not represent _SGS
students. The type of students and
interests are different,” Slaughter
said. ‘

In addition, the Governor had
indicated he would like to see these

appropriation.
' PHEAA used the delay to contact
the schools to verify the applicants

as full-time enrolled students.» ’

“This way money wouldn’t be sent
hereand sit unused,” said Allen.
‘ ‘The delayed decision was because
of the ﬁnancial strain.” .

’ More than 9,000 Pennsylvanians
missed the deadline for grants for
the 1974-75 academic year. Most
applications for aid for this year
were due .in January of 1974.

The amount of money to be
granted for the summer and the
1975-76 academic year is uncertain
at this time- “We will be forward

to several GOP-controlled investi-

Shapp said his administration is
working on its own to reduce costs,
taking 2,300 jobs, off the state
payroll by attrition and moving
toward another review of state
spending by a panel of business-
men.

He promised to submit by. March

Shapp‘s. major recommendations
in other areas included:

HUMAN SERVICES

2. Development of health care
centers in rural Pennsylvania.

3. Accelerated use of community-
based facilities for state prisoners
and the mentally ill.

of a constitutional change to permit
a graduated state income tax.

achieve “true tax justice” in
Pennsylvania.

The Socialist ruling

Jeapardizing 86 Elections

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

Elections are over, a new board
has been elected and, hopefully,
the rhetoric which usually sur-
rounds penny-ante politics will give
way to some sort of action.

Unfortunately, however, whatever
the new board accomplishes it will
labor under the onus of having won
its position in an election marred by
incompetence, not of the Elections
Committee, but of a Judicial Board,
which failed to live up to its
obligation to insure consistency in

enforcing the Elections code. In

particular, the Board’s decision’
permitting the Socialist candidates
to use their party name has_
seriously jeopardized the validity of
last week’s elections.

When the Elections Committee
ruled against ‘the ‘use of the
Socialist party title, two objections
were raised in protest of the
committee’s stand. First, many
people (not only the Socialists but
also letters to the Pitt News) stated
that -the Socialists’ constitutional
rights were violated by the denial
to run as a party. . Second, there
were objections to the way in which

' the Elections Committee made its

decision, supposedly after the fact
or “ex post facto.” V ‘
This second point is obviously

' ridiculous since the Elections Com-

mittee approved its bylaws in the
middle of last term, and copies of
the election code and the candidate
information sheet were available
before the Christmas vacation.

Unless the posters were printed’
before November, the ruling was

votes with little jugs of crude and
get the law changed _that says
you’ve got to be natural born to be

president and he'll become presi-.

dent. And we’ll be stuck with this
guy who wears a burnoose at his
inauguration. And Washington
streets will be splattered with

camel dung because he’ll probably

get homesick and decide that
everyone should ride camels in-
staed of taxi cabs. Hotel lobbies
will be cluttered with huge hookah
machines and he’ll probably steal
all the sand from Atlantic City New
Jersey and spread it around the
White House lawn. "
And then ' the other story.

Remember Bangladesh? They just
got a shiek for president, and they
didn’t even get a chance to say
whether they ‘wanted him or not.
He just came in and told, Parlia-
ment he wanted to be president, so
now he’s President Shiek Mujibur
Rahman of Bangladesh. No elec-
tion, no coup de’tat, no war. And
the story doesn’t‘elaborate on just
how he managed to do it. They

' were probably afraid to. The New

York Times needs a lot of oil for
their delivery trucks, you know?

Ah well, Bangladesh is way the
hell on the other side of the planet
and nobody cares about the place
except George Harrison, anyway.
But watch out, isolationist fools,
there’s always the domino theory,
and completely unofficial reports
have come in that Rahman and a
number of his liquored up com-
rades were seen in a slightly lit
Dacca bar the night of his inaugur-
ation clapping their hands and
slapping their knees while a thinly
clad chorus of belly dancers sang
an impromptu version of “Today
we've got Bangladesh, ‘tomorrow
the world.”

Smack off, Rahman. Top hats
aren't so bad. 2 '

certainly not “ex post facto.”
Further, as trite as it may sound,
ignorance of the code is no excuse.

The first point, the denial of
constitutional rights, is much more
serious and is, consequently, worth
closer consideration. It raises the
question of what the rights of
candidates are as well as whatthe
role of political parties are.

It is true that political parties play
an important part in American
politics, and that they are accepted
practice in many college elections.

However, the constitution does not

guarantee people the “right” to
form political parties. In fact, there.
is no mention of political parties
anywhere in the constitution or the
Bill of Rights.

What is protected are the rights of
Americans to participate in an open
election as either a candidate or an
elector. The Socialist candidates
were not denied the right to
participate‘ in the Student Govern-
ment elections, or even the right to
identify individually as Socialists.

Further, the Elections Committee
is a standing committee of Student
Government, the recognized rep-
resentative organization of Pitt
students. It, therefore, has the
power to establish whatever rules it
deems necessary to the conduct of
a fair election. The prevention of
the formation of political parties is
not the denial of a right, since there
exists no such right, and it does not
prevent anyone from participatin ’
in the election. s -

The motive behind this rule is
clear--to encourage students to
vote for a, candidate because of his
qualiﬁcations, not because of a

Overburdened:
Full of B.R.

To the Pitt News:

It has come to my attention that
Joseph White of the History
Department of the U. of Pittsburgh
has written a letter to the 18

.October Pitt News in which he

says, “Since students might feel
reticent about criticizing a faculty
member in a public forum...I’d like
to respond...”

I express my kindest regards to

‘ Joseph White forthis gallantry, but
at the same time, I did not respond
to the letter of Joan Huber,
“...once that egg gets fertil-
ized...”, because I was intimidated
by her position, but because I did
not want to dignify the assinine
supposition,‘ a fertilized egg owns a
woman’s body, by responding to it.

I am adamantly in favor of a
woman's right to choose and, had I
an audience with the lad, I would
not hesitate to express my point of
view to his holiness, the big daddy
of the Church of Rome.

As for faculty members and the
academic community, they are as
full of barnyard refuse (hereinafter
to be referred to as b.r.) as any
other segment of our society, and I
hope that no one allows themselves
to be intimidated by someone
burdened with an overload of b.r.
However, it is politic, as well as
polite, to refrain from telling the
overburdened that they are full of
b.r.; the resultant explosion is
rather messy and traumatic for all
involved.

Sincerely,

Karen Marsden -

label, be it Greek, Engineer, or
Socialist. The endorsement of

Mark Satinoff by the commuters _

and the Pitt News shows the
validity of this intention. Satinoff
was endorsed because of his ability
as an organizer, not his identiﬁca-
tion with‘ socialism.

Much has been made about the
ambiguity of the passage in'the
code dealing with political parties.
Actually, the wording is quite
clear.
set of candidates joined together to
“form a meaning greater than the
individual parts.” This clearly
points to the .use of any sort of
labels.

The passage also states, “Any
multi-name campaign material
with a generic title has the effect of
a political party.”
bothers to look up the definition of
generic (p. 348 in Websters 7th
Collegiate Dictionary) the meaning
is obvious.

By overturning the election com-
mittee’s decision, the Judicial
Board repudiated a code which it
had approved only two months
earlier, thus destroying the consis-
tency so desperately needed in
Student Government elections.
The Judicial Board is supposed to
be‘ apolitical and objective. It has

. failed miserably by succumbing to

outside pressures.

Perhaps one of the ﬁrst actions of
the new SG Board would be to
reevaluate the Judiciary and its
role. at Pitt, or at least try to select a
body of competent students who
can separate themselves from
emotional jargon.

H /-sfyemale nationalism in the Women's‘

1 “’-37'“

   

BY FELICE NEWMAN
_ AND HARRIS LEVY
Ti-Grace Atkinson, noted femin-
ist theorist, outlined the dangers of

‘Cultural Festival kickoff speech last
night._

Atkinson, the author of Amazon
0dyssey,_ called for a heightened
political awareness among women.
Distinguishing between cultural
nationalism, reactionary national-
ism, and revolutionary nationalism,
Atkinson said “Revolutionary na-
tionalism looks to thefuture.

“Reactionary nationalism runs
parallel to cultural nationalism
which promotes escapism, fantasy
and spiritualism,” she said.

Atkinson said the bond between
people is the core of nationalism. A

Nationalism depends upon a class

members of a group. This concept
of identity precedes nationalism.
Nationalism is .later developed
within the evolution of a given

people,” Atkinson said.

“In. order for a nation to form,
people must be objectiﬁed,” At-
kinson continued. “Organization-
ally, we all utilize some tactical
nationalism. But the temporary use
of ideology is dangerous, if. not
impossible. What was temporary
becomes permanent and the means
become the end.”

Atkinson then turned her atten-
tion to the various phases and

4, Zuvarieties of female nationalism.
-/

An early romantic period of
feminism was seen as the interim
stage to feminist cultural national-
ism. ~Atkinson’s sarcasm enter-

_ tained the audience with recollec-
tions of their own early naivete as
she-dramatized this romantic per-
iod. - . A

“That was when women ran
‘around saying, ‘Oh wow isn’t it
great we’ve found each other, isn’t
it beautiful; Oh wow! let’s hold

hands.’ But we’re into full-ﬂedged "

cultural nationalism now and have
been for the past three years. And
we’re in big trouble.”

The proliferation of feminist art,
poetry and media ‘ are possibly
evidence of cultural nationalism.
“Cultural nationalism is a signiﬁ-

One aspect of reactionary feminist
nationalism --is a tendency to judge
anything female as inherently
‘good,-’. which turns’ the tables, but
does not eradicate the sex roles
feminists are so concerned with.

The rising identiﬁcation of women
with the Earth Mother image is an
example of this which she implied
was self-destructive. T

Said Atkinson, “The ﬁrst issue I
really worked my. ass off on was
abortion...and here we are with
motherhood.”

“Matriarchy is reactionary na-

’f’“tionalism. It’s a revolution in the

power structure, not a change in
the system itself.” _

Reactionary nationalism deals
with the past while ignoring the
present impact. “A bad depression
can wipe out a lot of gains,”
Atkinson warned as she advised
women to be concerned with the
impact of economic problems.

Revolutionary nationalism, how-
ever, she‘ said, recognizes oppres-
sion as a phenomenon with many
variants.

Above all, nationalism should be
realistic. “We must cast a cold and
:1ln‘ony eye on present variables and
dangers.”

She cited the recent Boston March
Against Racism as an example.

“We have to be open to other,

, disaffected groups, people .who
know how to move. We can learn

she said,

from them and. we “can, teach. 

them.” Atkinson inferred that wo-
men can contribute a knowledge of
history gained through education.
“They know how to fight and
organize," how to stick together,
where to hit. One handhas to wash
the other.” V A
Separatism was not the answer,
calling for alliances
between feminists and other op-
pressed groups, for specific goals.
“But alliance does not mean mar-
riage, integration or trust,” she
cautioned. I . _
Atkinson was particularly ‘con-
cerned about the now-superﬁcial
bonds among feminists holding up
in the futurewithout a heightened
political awareness’ among women.
“There are many here tonight,
but when the shit" comes, the.
audience will thin out--radically.”
A friend’s dream was related to

the audience as Atkinson illustra-
ted the danger of politically blind
sisterhood. She said her friend had
dreamt of “women sitting Central
Park with earphones listening to
women's music. And. the’re all
happy listening to that music while
the pigs are putting up barbed wire
all around them.” _

“We don’t know how strong our
bonds are until we’ve been hit.
Given the reality factor at present, I
would not expect a great deal.”

In answering a question of the
suicidal nature of these bonds of
cultural nationalism, Atkinson said
“Some people would just as soon

suicidal, but, negative. I didn’t say’
it was suicidal-- just unesthetic.”

Questions of sexuality were also

You can do it, too. So far over 550,000 other people have done it. People who
have_dif_ferent jobs, different |Qs, different interests, different educations have
completed the course. Our graduates are people from all walks of life. These
people have all taken a course developed by Evelyn Wood, a prominent
educator. Practically’ all of them at least tripled their reading speed with equal or
better comprehension. Most have increased it even more.

Think for a moment what that means. All of them—-even the sIowest—now read
an average novel in less than two hours. They read an entire issue of Time or
Newsweek in 35 minutes. They don't skip or skim.- They read every word. They
use no machines. Instead, they let the material they're reading determine how
fast they read. And mark this well: they actually understand more, remember
more, and enjoy more than when they read sIow|y.‘That’s rightl They

timized themselves because of
these fantasies of love."
Individuals’ autonomy is included
in Atkinson’s vision. “I am for
people relation to each other--but
not as if their lives depended on it.
Only in the street, when you’re
facing the pigs is that called for.”
Atkinson's views on sexuality are
also discussed in “The Institutions
of Sexual Intercourse” in Amazon
Odyssey. Atkinson called the vol-
ume her “hood of errors,” saying
that would be its greatest value.
“Since my growth parallels the
growth of feminism, I hoped that
women would see the contradic-
tions in the book and not make
‘some of the same errors. In the

movement we have tended to
oversimplify everything. We tend
to think of violence as guns, bang,

“We’ve confused fantasy, rhetor-
ic and reality a great deal. We talk
so much about violence, yet the
people I know most connected to
violence never speak of it because
of a deeper respect for its conse-
quences and fallout. _

“We believe rape and getting
your brains blown out are synon-
yrnous. They're not. One is more
permanent. We must not oversim-
plify this because at our first

contact with it we will fall to ‘

pieces." Violence in the women’s

movement is discussed in detail in

   

The essays and speeches in
Amazon Odyssey make several
major points. Atkinson writes that
“female oppression was essentially
a class confrontation.” Atkinson

"also writes that feminism raised

philosophical issues; for instance,
the distinction between “function”
and" “capacity.”

The tactical/ ideological confusion
in the book is about the male-fe-
male confrontation,” Atkinson
said. “Is it biological or behavior-
al?” Atkinson believes it is beha-
vioral. _ p

The attack on men as the enemy
was directed at their behavior.
“But what you use as a tactic
becomes your ideology. If you live

The ballet itself was first
conceived to introduce the Fla-
menco style into
repertoire at the turn of the’
century. Nureyev choreographed it
along the lines of this early version
by Petipa. Sequences of Spanish
folkdances alternate with variations
on classical ballet form to provide
relief. This also gives the dancers a
chance to show off their ﬂexible

talents. A group of gypsies comes‘

to town and adds violence to the
dancing with their mock bullﬁght
and their dance of knives. The
chaste fantasies of Don Quixote on
the other hand allow a corps of
ballerinas to dance the stricter
classical style. The choreography
is not particularly innovative but
the alternation of scenes gives the
ballet freak the classical precision
he wants and it gives
uninitiated somecolor and vigor.
Surprisingly enough, Nureyev did
not choreograph the ballet all for
himself. His solos, when they
come, are dynamic. He plays the

news specials.

The picture it painted was of a
nation of women free from the daily
drudge of ‘domesticity, of men with
“raised consciousness” (the. term
should be destroyed), of little girls
on the football field and little boys
on the bench waiting to replace
Suzy the star halfback, of husbands
and wives working at careers while
a live-in minds the children.

These personas were presented
with such assertiveness and so

' little comment‘ or comparison that

one was easily led to believe that
these are the established norms of
living. As anyone with the slight-
est amount of perception knows,
these life-styles are in no way the
standard, but rather the exception
at this stage in the, women’s
movement. "Thus, “Of Women and
Men” was a prime example of
media propaganda.

A glaring example of choosing to
ignore the other side of an issue
came when a doctor afﬁrmed that
women in such sports as boxing
and bronco busting suffer no
damage to breasttissue or the
uterus wall. Maybe so.
from over is the debate since many
articles are being written by both
sides as to the effects of heavy
physical sports on the female body.

NBC’s failure to provide a state-

’ ment from the opposition was not

so much a ﬂaw in production as it
was a deliberate attempt to in-
ﬂuence the audience.’

Walters relayed a shoddily ar-
ranged morsel of bias when she
complained that though the local
hiring of women in television was
signiﬁcantly expanding, the hiring
by the national networks was not.
She then proceeded to cite the
three major networks and how
many male, as opposed to female,

correspondents were being em--

ployed. The ratios were severely
imbalanced, and sympathy was
again won for the feminist cause.

The Pitt Panther wrestling team,
with strong performances by every
member, handily thrashed Mary-
land by a score of 31-3 upping their
season mark to 3-2, while Terrapins

Ziropped to 6-8.

The match opened with a tough
bout between Kevin Nellis and the
Terp’s Henry Moore. After strug-
gling to gain momentum, Nellis
took the advantage and scored the
only ‘pin ‘ of the meet with 13‘
seconds left in the second period.
From there on, it was all downhill
for Maryland.

After sparring brieﬂy with his
.opponent, George “Fuddy” Bryant
threw in a quick reversal and two
point near fall to ice his match with
Greg Filipos, a 9-4 decision.

At 134 pounds, Pitt ace Randy
Stottlemeyer had a tougher time

\ﬁ,With Maryland’s Bill Schoy ‘(O-7)
‘ - fthanhe anticipated. Schoy miracu-

lously avoided. being pinned
despite three near fall decisions
awarded Stottlemeyer giving him
nine quick points. It was of little
consolation however as Stottle-
meyer ended up on the winning
end of a superior 19-2 decision
leaving Stottlemeyer undefeated
after ﬁve matches. '

The next match, one of-‘thecmore

. exciting of the evening, pitted Bill

Korth against Tim Rowan in a

matchup of 142 pounders. h
After matching escapes and take

downs, knotting the score at 3-3,

 Korth managed an escape in the‘
3 _, period for a ,4-3 edge.

Rowan fought back but couldn’t
manage_the take down until after
the ﬁnal whistle. In a ﬁt of rage,
Rowan stormed toward his bench,
only to sarcastically‘ applaude for

his victor, eliciting a chorus of boos
from the 400 plus fans on hand. _

Incensed, Pitt’s Skip Bolin came
out to hand Maryland’s Scott
Turkel only his third defeat in
ﬁfteen matches on a deliberate 3-2
contest at 150 pounds.

Terrapin Tyrone Neal,,with eight
takedowns to his credit gained a
superior decision over Pitt’s
scrappy Bob Kebr 21-10. With Neal
leading 10-1, Kebr made a _quick
move gaining a reversal and a three
point near pin, tightening the score
at 10-6. From there, it was Kebr
who would continually escape while
Neal scored five consecutive
takedowns to cop the match.

An unsportsmanlike conduct pen-
alty against Neal at the conclusion
of the match dropped the Maryland
point total to three.

“This was just a super perfor-
mance by the whole team” said an-
elated Coach Dave Adams. ‘ ‘Randy
Stottlemeyer is undefeated after
ﬁve matches. I was very very
pleased with the performances of
(Dan) Levine and (Craig) Evans,

(both of whom are wrestling only
their second varsity match.” '

At 167 pounds, Dan Levine
waltzed with his opponent brieﬂy
then handed the Terrapins their
sixth beating of the evening, a hard

fought 10-2 win, raising his record

to 2-0.
In the 177 pound weight class
Craig Evans squared off _ with

Terrapin Kevin Johnson (9-2-1) in
what might well have been the
highlight of an eventful evening for
the Panthers.

On the strength of a super-slick

reversal early in the match, Evans
found himself deadlocked. 10-10

Pitt scored- over twenty points on
the vaulting and floor exercises and
were only three tenths of a point
short of twenty on the beam. The
uneven bars were still their
weakest area with only a score of
16.4

‘‘I’m quite pleased with their

_ erformance,” Coach Donna De-

goal of twenty points on every
event for midseason, but we’ve
nearly accomplished it now.”

Warbutton won all-around honors
with 32.15 points, a score good
enough to qualify for the Easterns

Monday the team traveled to
Clarion for a meet and found the
going rough. Two members of
Clarion’s team had competed in
Nationals and the coach was an
international judge and an expert
in the field of gymnastics.
Nevertheless, the Pantherettes
scored a respectable 70.25 while
Clarion took 99.85 points. Only
Warbutton placed for Pitt and she
took third in the balance beam,
fourth in the ﬂoor exercise and
fourth all-around. '

“It was a nice meet, the girls were
very friendly,” coach DeMarino
said. ‘.‘Our girls were excited and
inspired by the Clarion team, -they
wanted to stay and practice after
the meet.” “Our progress is very
good,” she continued. “They have
years of experience over us, in fact
we have three girls that had never
competed in gymnastics at all
before this year.”

Two more of the Gymnastics team
qualiﬁed for the Easterns which
will be held March 20-22. Diane
Baumgartner will compete in the
floor exercise and Nancy Weisser
will be in the vaulting routine.

The Pantherettes will go on the
road again and try to improve their

Evans however had other plans. A

quick reversal took his opponent '

completely by surprise, and John-

a last second pin, and on the short
side of a 15-10 decision. Evans was
no less than spectacular.

Bill Bailey (2-2) and Ron Train

The Pitt basketball team will put
its four game winning streak on the
line tonight when they travel tocthe
Palestra to face the Temple Owls
and quite possibly win their ﬁrst
road game of the season.

Two things standuin the way of a
Pitt victory. Temple has the tenth
best defense in the country, and
the game is being played in the
Palestra, the haven for Philadel-
phia’s Big Five college basketball
team.

“City teams‘ have a tradition of
winning in the Palestra,” says
Coach Ridl. “Although their court
is 94 feet by 50, just like ours.”

Penguins con tinue Fine

  Play   Despite   Rumors

BY CONNIE GIEL

Everyone is so ‘concerned with
the Penguin’s precarious ﬁnancial
situation that a lot of excellent
hockey games have come and gone

without recognition.
The Pens have .. ‘several good

things going,‘ not» the least of which 2
is a current NHL record, Saturday

night’s 5-2 win over the New York
Rangers gave Pittsburgh fifteen
games without a loss at home.
Montreal handed down a 3-2 loss
November 27, but the Pens skated
back‘ to compile a 9-0-6 home
record since then.

The Penguins are 19-18-10 over-
all--just one game over .500--which
is another Pittsburgh ﬁrst. Never
before have the Pens collectively
held on to a plus ﬁgure after
mid-December.

Having lost only two of their last
20 home games, the Pens head into
an extended road trip after Wed-
nesday night's home game with the
Chicago Black Hawks. They’ll play

six games away before returning ’

home February 12 to meet the
Buffalo Sabres at the Civic Arena.
The team record is the result of a
revitalized roster. Goaltender Gary
Inness is at- .500 with a 13-13-8
mark that gives him a 3.38 goals
against average. The average
clung stubbornly to 3.48 for a while

as Inness’ efforts couldn’.t carry the
entireteam to the top of the charts.
Newcomer Michel Plasse has
helped the Pens square away the
goaltending problem that ﬁlled the
sports pages but, according to the
Penguin. front ofﬁce, never existed.
Anyway, no one goalie is number
one or two for-the Penguins. Plasse
and ‘Inness have been alternating
regularly since Plasse’s arrival
from Kansas City early in January.
Lately, too, the defense has
sneaked into the games. Tenacious
fore- and backchecking has made
the Penguins an exciting team to be
Defensemen two
through six are making life miser-

The best defense, however...is to
be found in any one of the
Penguin’s three high-scoring for-

ward lines. Center Syl Appls, back -

from his MVP performance in last

week’s ALL-Star game, is racking‘

up the points for himself and his
wingers. Right wing Jean Pron-
ovost, another ALL-Star, leads the
Pens in goals with 25.

Rookie center Pierre Larouche

goals by a ﬁrst-year player with 19.

  Oats “Strive” For Five  

pared to four players in double
ﬁgures for Pitt’s hoopsters.
Temple’s offense is a slow, delib-

erate offense, averaging only 50 to

60 shots a game, and the only thing
keeping them close to many other
teams is their ability to slow down
the pace of the game. Pitt’s fast
break offense should offer a great
challenge to Temple's style, pos-

sibly forcing them away from their '

game plan.

Temple’s starting roster includes‘ - 9 

three freshmen and one sopho-
more, and this inexperience could
provide Pitt with the opening they
need tobring home their ﬁrst road
win of the season. /

On paper, there is no reason why

Pitt should not beat Temple, even '

with the Owls’ tenth ranked de-
fense and home court advantage.
The only thing that could possibly
get in the way of ‘a Panther victory
is the supposed “road-game jinx.”

“This game _is pivotal from a
mental conﬁdence
says Ridl. “A win at Temple would
really help the conﬁdence of the
whole team.” V

Not only will a win at Temple help’
team conﬁdence, but it will extend

Pitt’s winning streak to ﬁve and .  V’
virtually assure the Cats of a place »
in the regional playoffs at West

Virginia in March?

~ The conﬁdence and poise ‘exhib- -

ited by the Panthers in the last four
games has been phenomenal, al-
lowing them to upset nationally
ranked Notre Dame and defeat a
tough Rutgers squad. That conﬁ-
dence and poise should extend
itself to the Palestra.

There is no question that Pitt
should defeat the Owls. Temple
just has too many weaknesses that
the explosive Cats can take advan-
tage of, Palestra or not. By the
time the Temple game is over, the
“road-game jinx” should become a
phrase of the past.

  Harris Fine Addition To RidI’s ’7 5 Squad

came here the rest of the guys on
the team got behind me and they
just told me to play my game.”

The value of that guidance is
becoming more apparent with each
game the Panthers play. Harris
has one of the smoothest jump
shots you'll ever see, and has
averaged 7.4 points per game this
year.

Furthermore, to the delight of the
Pitt fans and coach Buzz Ridl, in
four of the last six games the
amazing Harris has scored in
double figures. Just as impressive
has been the way Harris has begun
crashing the boards, and conse-
quently has become one of the

‘‘I feel better in there now,”
Harris explains, as a slight grin
appears on his face. “At the
beginning of the season I had a
little trouble with the defense. It’s
tough to learn, and for it to work,
the guys have to work together.
But now I sometimes flnd myself
calling out the defensive signals,
and that makes me feel good.”

Harris’ defensive play has im-
proved considerably since those
days early in the season when he
and the rest of the Panthers had to
do some soul searching because
things weren’t going their way.
Larry contributes the Panthers’
recent successes to “being more
aggressive on defense and re-
bounding.”

The future appears optimistic for
the Cats, primarily because they
have an excellent opportunity of
receiving an invitation to partici-
pate in the ECAC Southern Divi-

In the Panthers victory over
Rutgers on Saturday, Harris
grabbed seven rebounds, barely
missed sinking several tip-ins, and
blocked three shots in spectacular
fashion.

  

sion playoff, and then to appear in
the NCAA tournament.

For Larry Harris, however, these
are not primary concerns at the
present time.

“The rest of the year is going to
be tough’, Harris explains, shaking
his head which signiﬁes the
struggle to come. “We have to win
on the road in order to get into the
playoffs. I’d like to get into the
playoffs for the seniors’ sake;
that’s about the best thing we could
do for those guys. It’s important to
me, but even if we don’t get in, I
want to feel that we had a
half-decent season.” V

The sincere super-freshman is
completely devoted to basketball.
He doesn’t fish because “it’s too
boring, nor hunt because “I’m
afraid of guns.” He was recruited
by such schools as Alabama, Notre
Dame, and all the big ten schools
as a football player because he was

all-state as a wide receiver. In this
era of super jocks with super egos,
Harris remains himself and keeps
basketball in perspective.
“Basketball is my first love,”
Harris explains. “I love the game,
but if basketball wasn’t there I’d

still be the same person. No matter_*._-g--.\V ‘

what I’m doing, I like to be helping ‘ ‘ "

people." ,

Harris has connected on 48 per-
cent of his shots this year, a superb
statistic for a first year collegiate
player. His personal objectives are
to improve his ball handling and
rebounding.

The young man cracked the
starting lineup against North Caro-
lina State, and the fact that he was
playing against the nation’s top
college team had an immediate
effect on him.

“I was all shaken up against NC
State,” Harris admits with a half--
grin. “I used to watch those guys

on television, and there I was “5*;".,__“.‘

playing against them.”
Instant success of the type Harris ’

among the rookies. His wingers
are both well on the way to twenty
goal seasons, with 30 not too high a
plateau, either.

Captain Ron Schock’s 55 points
make this season by far his best

 H ever. Left wing Vic Hadﬁeld has 17

goals and 24 assists (sign on the
Arena message board--New York,
thanks for Vic). Rick Kehoe has 18
goals, a total that snuck into the
books almost unnoticed.

Penguin hockey is certainly some-
thing to yell about now. It’s as if
General Manager Jack Button sits
in the locker room and programs
the team before each game. “You
WILL score goals. You WILL keep
the goals against to a minimum.

' RON SCHOCK

 

You WILL win this game.”
Whatever he’s saying or doing, it’s
working._

Maybe the stories of a move to
Denver or Seattle have brought the
hibernating hockey fans out of their
caves. Saturday night’s game with
the Rangers was a sell-out as
13,403 fans responded to media
editorials urging them to support
Pittsburgh hockey. .

Earlier this month, owner Tad
Potter reportedly said the Pens
would have to attract an average
10,000 fans for weekday games.
He said 13,000--near capacity--
would have to show up for Saturday
games to help the Penguins ﬁnish
the season. Saturday night’s
sell-out raised the Penguin’s sea-

son attendance average to 10,249--
still far short of Potter’s mark."
Button, Potter, and coach Marc

Boileau are at a loss to explain the -

fluctuating attendance ﬁgures. All
are convinced that Pittsburghers
will stick with a winner. They cite
as a case in point the Super Bowl
champion Steelers. Well, the
Penguins are winning--were the
sellouts of the 25th and 18th mere
flukes? ‘

The Pens are 10 points out of ﬁrst
place in the James Norris Division
of the Prince of Wales Conference.
Montreal and Los Angeles are
battling at the top with 67 points
each, while the Pens have 48.

Pittsburgh is practically assured
of .a playoff spot in the Stanley Cup
championships, so the goal now is
to creep higher in the standings. If
the Pens were to ﬁnd themselves in
the first playoff round playing the
Boston Bruins or the Montreal
Canadians, all might well be lost at
the start. But now, heading into
the ﬁnal -third of the season, the
Pens are paired with the second
place New York Rangers.

Broke or not, the Pens are playing
extravagant hockey. High scoring
games have become their trade-
mark. Wide open hitting and

I checking is right at home in the
Arena. Too bad a lot of people are

missing it all.

But

Barbara didn’t mention that.

On the brighter side, believe it or
not, was an excellent point made in
a dramatic reading by Viveca
Lindfors. She proclaimed herself a
housewife and began to tell the
story of a divorced man who
needed his house cleaned, his
meals cooked, his laundry done--in
short, he said, he needed a wife.
Lindfors said, “Well, I’d like a
wife, too,” then went on to tell how
she could begin enjoying her life
while her wife would keep the
house going. ,

A disheartening segment of the
program ‘occurred when actress
Ellen Burstyn branded the giving
of one’s self to another “a delu-
sion." She remarked that people
are alone and will be alone at the
end also, and that when someone
claims someone else as his or her
own, they are fantasizing. You’ve
come a long way, baby, it’s sad to
say. '

Despite the fact that male chauv-
inism (this term should also be
destroyed) will soon be nonexis-
tent, the justice in the victory will.
somehow be empty unless both
men and women abandon
Burstyn’s self-seeking attitude.

who could very well stand to lose
the most in the push for equality: «
the world’s children. This is not to
say that women should be denied
the same life that any man has, not

But a government-sponsored day-
care program is no substitute for a
family, and I shudder to think what
such a government-weaned society
would be like at the age of, say,
forth. The only solution, if we are

Mixture of Ari Forms:

(Continued from Page 7)
village bantam, so of course his
dances are full of twists and triple
kicks in midair. But a good part of
the time he spends supporting
Lucette Aldous in her leaps and
pirouettes.

The success of the cinemato-

graphy lies "in the fact that the

ballet is not just rolled onto film.

The human danceis translated into
a dance of color and light. Part of
the time the camera focuses on the
movement of the human body’.

Part of the time it catches the
sweeping fans and the ﬂouncing
red skirts. The ballet becomes
abstract motion. The scene below
the windmills cuts an especially

brilliant contrast. At first we watch
a pas de deux between Nureyev
and Aldous that is little more than a
silhouette against the twilight sky.
Then as night takes hold, an entire
company of gypsy dancers is
reduced to the shadows and gleams
of their satins. g
Perhaps to the purists the
technicolor was a ﬂashy washtover
top of the dance, but it made the
ballet tangible to others. The ballet
came into its own as entertainment.
