The concert given by the Pitt Band
‘in Carnegie Music Hall on.._Thursday
evening o—f_1,ast".week probably marks

Specter, cornetist, as .a member of
the organization and directs attention

service which will be exceedingly dif-
ficult for others to duplicate.
" ‘For seven years, four as- an under-

signia. and has been one, of the stars
of the comet section. He is well-
known to thousands of alumni and
others as the jazz cornetist‘ whose
work has been featured for years be-
tween the halves at football games

has performed. .His real ability and
worth as ea Icornetist, however, “has
been best illustrated at the annual’
home concerts ‘of the band where by
his rendition of classical numbers,
Specter as cornet soloist. has won
praise. from "musical" critics and lay-
men alike. " 

in the fall of 1916 and his service has
been continuous.s‘in.ce’that time. A
musician whose services have ever-
been in demand by outside agencies
he has never permitted his allegiance
to swerve but has readily and Willing-
ly sacriﬁced both time and money to"

EDWARD S-PEOTER

help make, the band the creditable mu-
sical organization that it is today. "
That Specter’s loyalty and eﬁorts
have been appreciated by band auth-
xorities is evidenced. by ‘a "statement
‘made by M. S." Rocereto at the conclu-
sion of last 'Thiursday’s concert. “The”
graduation of ‘Specter in ‘June will
mean the losslto,-the Pitt Band of one
of the most capable musicians who as
"a member of the band has lightened
my work tremendously." With Spec-
ter in Chair No; 1 in the cornet-_sec-
tion, I knew ‘there was nothing to
worryabout. ~No matter how difficult.
the number 1 could always depend,
.upon- Specter -to carry his‘ section
throug .” — h .
._Specter’s‘ scholastic-work has been
on a par with his playing, his record
“as a student on the campus and also
at Law School being an enviable one.
He is. also a composer of ability, hav-
ing written the music for the “Survey
Song” and f‘I’m~No't in LoverWith,

among the-best sung by the Cap and

‘given by Dr. Francis Tyson, Professor

of  Economics in the ’ University,-

7 5-_before" the Pumas Club, in the Ruskin

- Apartments, Thursday noon. _ 7‘
Dr. Tyson advocates, a new econom-
ic immigration policy which would

 provide legislation for a National Im-

7 ,.njiigration Commission, or Board, who

.would, operate a sliding scale‘ of ad-

’, missions. The percentage of new-
 comers should be elastic, shifting with

. ‘ relation to: First, economic condi-‘

..‘j-tions in America, as interpreted by

‘ the board; and secondly, such a com-
mission should raise or lower the

 jscale of admission,_group by group,

. -_with,re_lation- to the effectiveness of

__ “ naturalization and Americanization of

 T the foreign born in this country.

‘.‘The presgnt three per cent restric-
tion of nationalsas returned by the
census of '1910,”.said Dr. Tyson, “is

; ind_efensible,,whether on economic or

humanitarian‘ grounds. ‘. The recently

reported house resolution of the im-

I

‘s-migration‘ and labor committee is

jeven more reactionary. lt;,_changes-
the per centum, restriction to"‘two per

Mr. Fieldner stressed pari_}?icul'arly
the development of the gas mask for

explained -that a gas mask can be used
in places - where there is sufficient

oxygen in the poisonous area,”'Abut3notA A
in places where the oxygen has been

depleted by -ﬁre orexplosion, as IS
the" case after mine explosions." In

such cases; he-said, a mask having" an '
