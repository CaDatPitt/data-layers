MORE POWER TO THEM is all
we can say about Carl Olson’s cross
country boys. Personally, we have
never had the least desire to go run-
ning around in our underwear in
the rain and wind, especially when
the running was mostly uphill. But
everyone‘ has dicerent tastes and if
Carl’s boys like that sort of thing, it’s
their privilege. We admire their
“vigor,” but we do not envy them.
We catch cold just thinking about it.

THERE WAS A ’1‘IlV£E when Pitt
athletes made a point of advising

their brothers, cousins, and friends-
not to go to lPitt'i. .But a glance at

this year’s freshman class creates the

. imp_ressio_n that those days are over;
Included in the class of 1943 are a

Test, a Malarkey, and a Nadaro. You
may remember Red Tost of ICAAAA
fame and Leo Malarkey, former Pitt
halfback.- Their brothers are here.
You probably don’t remember a Na-

Iron, Steel Production
l Reaches New Heights

 

Ostensibly materializing from the
need for war materials, business ac-
tivity in the Pittsburgh district last
week recorded one of the largest
[gains of the year, according to ﬁg-
lures just released by the University
§Bureau of Business Research.

Above the 100 per cent level for
‘ the ﬁrst time since October, 1937, the
Bureau’s general business index for
the district was 103.2 per cent of the
1923-25 average against 97.1 for the
week ending September 9.

Iron and steel production, nucleus

of heavy industrial production of
war materials and by-products, rose
to new heights for the recovery
movement that zoomed from 59 last
May to this week’s 103.2.

Retail trade, in comparison with
manufacturing, received its ﬁrst
substantial gain in two months, ad-

vancing four points on the trade ‘in-
dex. Department store sales rose
more than seasonally.

With the reconditioning of river
barges, and large re—employment of
