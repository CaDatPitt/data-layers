ARNE SORENSEN A
' First Assembly speaker

 

the time of the assembly are en-
couraged to accept the invitation
to attend. _

“In View of Mr. Sorensen’s po-
sition in Europeyand his gifts as a
speaker,” said T. W. Biddle, dean
of men, it is conceivable that he
will have much interesting and
unpublished information to pre-
sent.”

Mr. Sorensen is a speaker with
a remarkable range of intellectual
interests and a very striking plat-
form ability. His past has been
colored by. experiences as ‘a leader
of the Danish resistance movement
at the time of the Nazi occupa-
tion.» A 4

He _is currently engaged in
launching a European magazine
designed" to relate the isolated
German’ _culture to the main
stream of European culture.

Mr. Sorensen was brought to
this country ‘to tour American
universities because of his inter-
est in the university life of Eu-
rope.

Since he has just completed a
survey in Germany for .the Am-
erican Military Government, _the
Danish leader is especially equip-
ped to discuss the -German uni-

tyersities.

Steals Show at Stadium

Even the cheerleaders took a
beating Saturday. E '

One energetic young man with
a whistle (well wet) did what
generations of white-clad cheer-
leaders with megaphones seldom
achieved —— he got Pitt to cheer.

Late in the third quarter, when
the Panthers were getting used to
crossing the goal line backwards
and the men in white sweaters
had tired of doing their mute pan-
tomime before the student stands,
Mike Hill, a Bus Ad senior, shov-
ed his bottle ﬁrmly into his hip

"pocket, pulled out a police whistle

borrowed from his brother, blast-
ed it, and yelled for a big ‘Sock
it to "em.’ , “

Starting with the farthest stu-
dent bleachers, the cheer picked
up momentum until it rocked the
stadium, with Mike giving out
with an unorthodox but effective
exhibition of cheerleading down
front.

After a few more "'sockittoem’s’
and an ‘alleghenee,’ Mike jumped
from the stadium wall to the play-
ing ﬁeld, got up, and ran over to
join the red-raced cheerleaders.

Evidently Blackstone’s Bounc-
ing Boys cramped Mike’s style, or
vice-versa, because it wasn’t long
before Mike had the ﬁeld to him-
self. ‘

“Give ’em Hill,” muttered Cap- 
tain Blackstone. i

Chased from the ﬁeld in the
fourth quarter’ by the gendarmesf
Mike waited beyond the goalposts

for one of the many Irish con-_

Local Chapter
Of Sigma Tau
Sponsors Meet

Engineers from Tallahassee’
to Tacoma converge on Pitt
this week. as representatives
from 25 chapters of Sigma. Tau
engineering fr-aternit_‘v gather
here for their biennial con-
clave.

Beginning Thursday, Pitt’s Psi
chapter plays host to student en-

gineers and alumni from all over’

the nation, more especially f1‘.O111
the West.

The local chapter, one of the
larger Sigma Tau groups, is head-

ed by President John Shmunk,

who together with Professor Philip
E. Rush, faculty adviser. and Mr.
C. L. Schultz, conclave chairman,
have planned a well-balanced
program of feasting and fun to

round out a heavy schedule of leg— ‘

islative sessions.
_'? Registration on Thursday

Headquarters for the conclave
are the Foster Memorial and Ho-
tel Schenley. Registration for the
week-end -convention begins at
Foster Hall Thursday morning_.
followed by the opening session.

Thursday evening’s program in-
cludes a smoker for all delegates,
local members and alumni in Fos-
ter social room. Publicity Chair-
man Joseph Keepﬁnger promises
a varied program- for the get-to-
gether.

Following Friday morning’s
meeting, delegates will travel to
Braddock for a tour of the Car-
negie-Illinois Steeel Corporation’s
Edgar Thomson Works. This plant,
site of Andrew Carnegie’s ﬁrst
mill, also includes one of Pitts-
burgh’s newest steeel mills. The
Sigma Tau men will be conducted
on their tour by Dr. M. A. Gross-
man and ofﬁcials of the plant.

Banquet in Cathedral

Returning from the tour, the

engineers will hold their Official

Conclave Banquet at the Faculty ..

Club, on the seventeenth floor of
the Cathedral. _ .

NOT SPECTACULAR-

Arne Sorensen comes to the University Thursday for the
ﬁrst lecture of the current school year. ' .

Mr. Sorensen was one of the leaders of the Danish resist-.
ance movement during the German occupation and served in
the ﬁrst postwar‘Danish cabinet. He also achieved considerable
note as an educator and recently completely a survey, of edu-
cation in Germany today for the United Nations. I

With such a speaker it would hardly seem necessary to
urge sudents to turn out for the assembly. But it is. Many,
many speakers, authorities in their own ﬁelds and with back-
grounds comparable to Mr. Sorensen’s, have spoken here——and
spoken to half-ﬁlled auditoriums. There have been experts on
the United Nations, the \Vorld Federalists, Palestine, and a host
of otherimportant topics. Yet, for some reason, students feel
that such lectures just aren’t Worth their time. .

It ’s so inconsistant.' Not so longlago students were on their
hind legs demanding the right to hear political speakers. They
were mature enough, they said, to hear divergent ideas and
then form their own opinions. .

Maybe so. But the thin scattering of people in attendance -
at «most of the Student Congress-sponsored assemblies stands
as evidence to the contrary. Mature people form the. habit of
basing their opinions on information as Well as argument.

Mr. Sorensen, and men like him who -speak at student
assemblies, certainly are not as spectacularly attractive as the
Vllallaces, Roosevelts, and representatives of the various other
political parties. But at the same timehis talk is much more
likely to be fact rather than propaganda.

Classes won’t be dismissed Thursday for the assembly. But_
there. certainly are enough studentswithout third hour classes
to ﬁll Foster Memorial several times over. If they can just tear
themselves away from the Tuck Shop for a while.

A HAND FOR THE BAND "

Newspaper policy is such that most editorial columns are

..
of praise is passed out.

The News feels that the so-called power of the‘ press can
be used for constructive means by calling attention to that
which -is praiseworthy. as well as the less commendable phases
of University life. -_

In line with this policy, it seems that the Pitt band de-
serves an editorial bouquet. Director Robert L. Arthur ’s troup
of 120 musicians has always been popular with th_e_st.udent
body and rightly so. Through the years of dietempliasis, probes,
and mud slinging, the band has consistantly maintained a top-
notch level, of performance. . _. -

lVith their services often in demand, the band has played
for a great number of University aﬁairs. Pep rallies, smok-
ers, banquets, and concerts all have been sparked by the musi-
cians. But.it hasn’ft'been -easy. ’ -

Each. routine that is so ﬂawlessly performed at the‘ Sat-
urday football games requires hours of preparation, and re-
hearsal. The elaborate formations always come off without
error and the music is excellent. This is made allthe more
remarkable by the fact that the University does not sponsor a
music school. Other institutions that do, often have bands that
do not approach Pitt’s in quality. .

\ When the notes-of “The Thuriderer,” the band’s theme,
swell in the stadium, 10,000 students thrill. to t_he sight of the
Pitt band marching onto the ﬁeld. Their 'pride is fully justi-
ﬁed for Pitt has the finest band in the land. ‘us

So here’s a journalistic blue ribbon to "the boys in the
band—-winners every time.

E,ditor’s Note: The University’s
multi.-million dollar building pro-
gram is only one of the many such
expansion movements in progress
on campuses across the country.
Recently a survey was made to
determine -the exact extent of
these building programs and what

they mean in dollars and cents.

The results, recently released are

published below. A ‘

Washington, D. c.-— (I.P.) —-A; '

composite picture of college and
university building needs for the
future from the, generally ,con—,

 

servative reports of presidents and I .

business oiﬁcers ofhigher educa— ‘
tiO_n reveals their need for an ad- i
ditional 265,000,000 square feet of‘
buildings, according to a recent
survey completed: by the U. S.
Oﬂice of Education.

The report showed that the col-
leges now have 341,500,000 square
feet of plant. It also sketched the
activities of the Federal Govern-
mentin providing temporary’ fa-
cilities and the efforts of the col- I
leges in building permanent struc- '
tures.’

“The difﬁculty in. meeting -the
college building "needs has" been

inﬂation of construction , costs,
which on the average are now

states. “In. ‘addition to space pro-
vided prior; to March, 1947, the
Government has constructed or is
in the process of constructing 31,-
000,000 square feet of war re-used
buildings for the colleges, and the
colleges themselves have funds in
hand or in sight to build an esti-
mated 48,000,000 square feet of
permanent buildings.

“Together this accounts for 30
per cent of their needs and is es-
timated to be worth approximately
$l,000,000',000.

“The $64 question, which the
report does not attempt to answer,
is -h0W Will colleges get the $2,-
500,000,000 required to complete
and equip ‘the additional buildings
needed or"the.$l,500,000,00 likely
to be required for replacements,

for meeting higher standards, for .

colleges not covered by the sur-
vey, and for new college ventures.

“Since two—thirds of the build-
ing space is sought by tax sup-
ported institutions,” the report
concludes, “presumably that pro-
portion of_ the costpwill be sought
from -taxpayers, However, no one

is at all sure that taxpayers. and

philanthropists together, will by 5‘

Alldred Room Books
Listed By Writer

Editor, The -Pitt News:

A New students should learn early
in their University life of the A11-
dred Room, apart of theiUniVer-
sity Library ‘located on the sixth
_ﬂoor, opposite the Reserve Book
Room. It is a combination brows-

ing room and circulating library,‘

books for which ‘are purchased
from a fundlleft by the Alldred
family in memory of Peter All-
dred, a lover and collector of good
books.

In this room are to be found
almost complete collections of
standard authors used in connec-
tion with courses in English and
American literature, together with
writings of new and promising au-
thors from here and abroad. About
half the ‘shelf space is taken up
with ﬁction and letters, the rest is
occupied by the best of the new
books in the ﬁelds of biography,
history, travel, science,’ and phi-
losophy, which have been written
with the general publicin mind.
Because of the smallness of the
collection in the Alldred Room, a
quicker and more personal service
is possible than in the main Lend-
ing Department.

Presides Over

  lantern   Night \»

Queen Corinne Nelan of the
class of 1948 returns to campus
Saturday night to participate in
traditional
ceremonies.

In what is known as the oldest
of traditional events here, 350
girls of the class of 1952 are’

I scheduled to be feted.

The evening’s activity is-divided
into two sections. The ﬁrst gets
underway in the auditorium of
Foster Memorial at 7 p.m. when
the freshmen, clad in white, re—-
ceive their lanterns from Father
Pitt, Lenore Mussoff, Chief Jus-
tice of Senior Court.

Later, the assemblage of men-
tors and freshmen follow Father
Pitt to the Commons Room where
the main ceremony occurs.

It is ‘at this time that the class
of 1952 pledges to seek the ‘inner
light ‘of truth.’ This light is passed
on to them from the light [of

- knowledge, which at the time of

the ceremony burns in an urn at
the feet of Alma Mater, Virginia
Reynolds. It is from thisﬂame of
truth that the freshmen receive
the light for their lanterns. , '
During the ceremony in the
‘Commons Room,
will again be greeted by Father
Pitt and by Miss Nelan.
' Metal lanterns used in the cere-
mony are individual presents to
each freshman woman from Dr.
John G. Bowman, President Hon-
orarius of the University. Each is
personalized with the respective
girl’s name.

¢News last year.

Under. the program name of
“Music ——i For You,” Walk rides
herd Monday through Friday on a
record program that features light
classical music exclusively.

“It’s a little different from man-
aging the business end of the

having a good time.”

“By that ‘we’ I meant myself
and the listeners who call in to
shoot the breeze. If some poor fel-
low.climbs out of the wrong side
of bed and feels like calling me up

pathetic wife, I feel low with
him.” i .

“I play‘ different music,” Walk
went on proudly. “The program’s
built around ‘pop’ music, light
classics,’ and selections from musi-
cal comedies. My listeners seem to
like it.”

No vocals are allowed on W alk’s
program, which goes out from 6:30
to 8'a.m.

In addition to his unique brand
of records, Walk throws in for
good measure the usual time

ery half hour, and an occasional
weather report.

He admits that he could use.
some more listeners. “Just turn
to 860 on the dial,” he asks.
“WHOD is the only station in that
range and I have no interference,
which is more than I can say for
the time I spent with the News.”

Walk, a business administration
senior, also claims to his fellow
students that he tells no jokes on

Before the war, the band used
the 23rd ﬂoor for its tuning up.
in
1946, the 8th ﬂoor became its new
stomping -grounds. .

Later, with the resumption of
remodeling in the interior of the
building, the musicians once again
were asked to vacate.

Arrangements were made to use i"

Logan Armory; plenty of room
but bad acoustics prevailed. Mr.

‘ Arthur yearned for a better place

but made the best of things at the
Armory.

It wasn’t long until his dream
came true, but along with it was
the familiar headache. The Na-

tional Guard had expanded so!

greatly that it was deemed neces-

sary to take over the armory com-_
pletely. The band was given the

stadium basketball court for prac-
ticing and once again bad acous-
tics made it a tougher job for the
players and director. '

helping hand from Ivan Holm,

Pitt Players technical director,

who had some old stage curtains
hung up, the band is making the

best of it. The curtains have re-‘

lieved some of the sound trouble
but the members would stilllike

ter when the ball was snapped.

In the—Double 'I‘ there ‘are two
quarterbacks stationedjjust behind
the center, but no detection was
made of the misdemeanor in the
abundance of publicity given the
new allignment.

So at Pitt Stadium the trap was
laid. A ﬁve-yard penalty would
greet the Double T, and‘ a much-
talked-about, ‘nationally famous
invention would be rule-booked to
death. ‘

The victim, however, never ap-
peared for its own execution.

Notre Dame coach Frank Leahy,‘
asked after the game why he did

not use the formation, said that

there was no need for it because

his more orthodox plays were get

ting good results. -
As to the legality of his creation,

Leahy stated, “Oh, it's deﬁnitely

legal. We’ve measured .the dis-

tances ‘involved very carefully.”

Photographs, nevertheless, of
the Notre Dame-Purdue game in
which the formation made its
debut, distinctly show. the second
quarterback to be in the forbidden
territory. '

5 Fine Form

By DAVE SMITH

Scatbacks arepotent weapons in any football team’s ar-

senal.

Pitt’s freshman grid squad has such an asset in Bob Best-

wick, former Shaler high standout.
In recent scriminages, Bob has demonstrated the form

which gained for him a post
A

on the ALL-TVPIAL Class A,

roster last season. D

His speed, drive, and defensive
ability stamp him as a player to
be watched in the future.

Bestwick servedhis high school
apprenticeship at two positions,
fullback and left .half. At the pres-
ent time he is,_running-from the
latter slot.

Shaler. coach Forrest (Red)
Ford employed the‘ T formation

_ during Bob’s three years on the_

eleven._ Thus, the single wing is

‘something of a—.new experience

for him. However, he seems to

’ have caught -on quickly to the

plays involved in the power sys-
tem. _
The 18-year-old frosh tailback,
who stands; ﬁve—feet—nine ‘and
weighs a trim 176 pounds, proved

instrumental in leading last year’s.

vShaler outﬁt to a successful sea-

son. A
Bestwick also performed under

the lights at Forbes Field in Au— _

gust, when the All-stars clashed.

Other sports in which Bob par-
ticipated and received letters in-
clude basketball and track.

In last week’s drills, freshman
mentor Ted Schmitt used Best-
wick on offense against a group of
red-jerseyed ﬁrst—year candidates.
The scarlet tops,‘ holdovers from
the Shaughnessy regime, were
worn by the - defense as distin-
guishing features.

‘Concentrating on basic running
plays, the offense found it rough
going against -the opponents’
heavy line. In spite of this, a few
notable gains were recorded by
some of the backﬁeld prospects.

Palestine Reviewed
ln Van Paasen Talk

,_ Arbiter, journalist, and observer of world aﬁairs are three Ways
to describe Pierre Van Paassen who spoke at a meeting sponsored
-by the IZFA at the YM&WHA on Monday evening, September 27.

Mr: Van Paassen, a_ native of

of the Sorbonne, chose as his subject, “Palestine.” He explained
the miracles wrought with the barren soil of Palestine by the Jewish
people and their perseverence through series of’ misfortunes _and

opposition -from Great Britain.

Incomparing the -situation of ‘the Israeli with that of the, Span-
_ish Loyalists, Mr. Van Paassen asserted that receiveing ‘help from
Russia in this case would only serve to type the Israeli cause as

A
V

communistic.

.Pierre Van Paassen began his C
1 career as a journalist in Canada,

where he was reporter
Toronto Globe. ‘

Next he became foreign corres-
pondent _for the New York World
with his assignments taking him
to many corners of the globe cov--
ering such events as the Riff re-
volt in Morocco, the Pilsudski
putsch in Poland, the rise of Mus-
solini in Italy and Hitler in Ger-
many, and the Ethiopian War.
Many times he visited the ghettos
of Eastern Europe and observed
conditions in them.

In his lectures over the United
States, Mr. Van Paasen has traced
the development of Palestine and
the pressure brought to bear

for the

against the rising state by Great .

Britain.

Books such as “Days of Our
Years”, “The Forgotten Ally,” and
“Earth Could be Fair” have in-
creased his reputation as a novel-
ist. -Moreover, Mr. Van Paassen
is an ordained minister in the
Unitarian Fellowship, a doctor at
Hebrew letters, and an honorary
citizen of Tel Aviv.
