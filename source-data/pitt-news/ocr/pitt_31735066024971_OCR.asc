 

Henderson criticizes retention

By Megan Bertino
Editor in Chief

A minority coordinator “ain’t gonna

make a god damn bit of difference” at Pitt .

without the support and commitment of

the entire university community, according

to Provost Donald Henderson.
Henderson said he opposed the idea of

"the university establishing a senior staff

position to concentrate on minority
retention. He said such a position would
establish a ‘-‘Super Nigger” who would
only have control over funds specified for
African—American students.

someone who has access to all university
resources. I

The idea of a minority coordinator
was proposed at Monday’s Senate
Council meeting ‘by Jonathan Schooler,
head of the Faculty Senate under-
graduate affairs committee on minority
retention.

The proposal, which was unanimously
approved by the Faculty Assembly, would
link all university minority-support
programs and expand current scholarships
for minority students.

The proposal, which has been in the
making for three years, was withdrawn by

or table it was initiated. -

Senate members asked that Schooler
seek greater input from the Office of the
Provost, which has been working on
solutions for poor minority retention at
Pitt, and Eqipois, a committee of African-
American faculty which has also been
working for a solution

Currently, 35 percent of all minority
students who enter Pitt will graduate within
five years, compared to the 70 percent of
non-minority students who will graduate
within ﬁve years.

While acknowledging a need for better
minority programming, Henderson

State Senate
ok's campus
security bill

By Julie Sabol

News Editor

All students attending a college or
university in Pennsylvania may soon
have the right under the law to have
access to reports of criminal activity
on ‘any campus in the state due to
the Pennsylvania Senate's
unanimous passing of the the
Tilghman bill.

If the bill passes the state House
of Representatives, college and
university police departments will
be required to open their police
logs to public scrutiny, to maintain
daily logs of all responses to valid
complaints of reported crimes and

to include the names and addresses H
i’ of persons arrested and the charges

filed against them.

Though crimes may not decrease,
Tilghman said he believes if people
are unaware of the crimes occurring
around them, their safety and welfare
are compromised and their chances
of becoming victims increase.

All logs would be required to -be
made public and available without
charge to all students.

‘_‘Students at a university . in
Pennsylvania have a right to go to
the campus security and look at the
crimes that are being’ done. Some
[colleges] are doing it now, but in
some cases students have a very
difficult time getting the
information,” Tilghman said.

“It’s important to know [what
crimes are occurring]; at least the
campus paper can report what's
going on on the campus.”

Tilghman is optimistic that the bill
will pass the state House .of
Representatives swiftly and will then
be sent to Pennsylvania Governor
Robert Casey for his signature.

Pigheadedness, irresponsibility
and arrogance are the reasons
why the newspaper is no longer
appearing on doorsteps around
the city, according to Teamster
lawyer Joseph Pass_.

“lTbe Pittsburgh .
negotiators] are arrogant, ignorant
and absolutely irresponsible to
their workers They are
corporate pigs  They’re like the
robber barons of the 18005,” Pass
said.

The strike, which has been
going on ‘for over a month, is
between The Pittsburgh Press
Company and Teamsters Local
211, which distributes the papers
for the Press and Post-Gazette.

Although they are separately
owned, the two newspapers
operate under a joint-operation

Press-

distributed by the Local 211.

The Teamsters went on strike
over the proposed redistribution
system the Press had announced
earlier in the year.

Although the plan would cause
450 jobs to be lost, Press
spokesperson Randall Notter said
the number of job losses was
flexible and indefinite.

“We are flexible in the effects
of the distribution chain. We feel
that we have a right to change
our method of delivery, but in
that change We’re willing to
negotiate how it affects our
workers,” Notter said.

He said that the Teamster’s
statements are untrue, that the
Press has been very cooperative
and rather that “the Teamsters
have not been very cooperative.”

Notter said he was disappointed
with the infrequency of the

hoped they would increase. He
said the Press is willing to sit down
at the table and work everything
out. - '
“We’re just kind of plugging
along; we want to work through
this. We’re hopeful the meeting
will become more often,” Notter
said. _

Pass agreed that the Press was
willing to meet, but he said it did
not matter because it was not
changing its position at all.

“They’re a bunch of show; every
time we meet it’s the same story.
Sure they’ll meet, but it's the
same thing. Th'eir ﬂexibility is
quite simple — my way or no
way,” Pass said.

Though Notter said no
predictions were being made as
to how long the strike would last,
Pass said if the Press continues “in
their present mindset, hell no”

Pass said the Press is using this
strike to its own benefit and that
it does not care if it continues.

The Press is using this as its *

opportunity to corner the -morning
paper market and run the Post-
Gazette out of it, according to
Pass.

“Mark my words: when this.

comes out, the Post—Gazette will
not be a morning paper,” he said.

Due to the strike, both the
Press and Post-Gazette have laid
off workers. The Presslaid off 500
employees who were not
Teamsters, while the Post—Gazelte
laid workers as well.

Both the Press and Post-Gazette
are attempting to ﬁll the void left
by the absence of these papers.

The Allegheny Bulletin, which
is written by Press employees, is
being distributed via the post

V office. Though no bylines appear

advertising do.

“ 7beAllegbenyBulletz'n is a very
good stride in satisfying the need
of our advertisers. It was by choice
there was no bylines. It’s meant
to be a benign, generic product
to fill a temporary void,” Notter
said. _

The Bulletin is not to be

associated with the Press or Post-
Gazette, Notter said. “When we
publish a paper under this
situation, we have to be fair to
both papers," he said.
4. Though all the writers of the
temporary paper are from the
Press, Notter said that is because
only one staff is needed and the
Press was chosen because it is a
non—unionized staff.

The Post—Gazette is continuing
to put out its Daily News Faxes‘
and offers telephone updates and
services to inform its readers.

For The Pitt News

A doctoral graduate student at
the University of Pittsburgh has
reached an out—of-court
agreement with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation after ﬁling
suit in April with the help of
lawyers working on behalf of the
American Civil Liberties Union.

Following a six-year—old
Freedom of Information Act
request for the FBI to release its
documents about the Workers
Alliance, a left-wing organization
that lobbied for the unemployed
during the depression, and its
leader David Lasser, Pitt student
Eric Davin obtained a settlement
with the FBI.

4 “The lawsuit brings success —
maybe you can fight the feds and
win! Everybody laughed when I
said I was suing the FBI,” member
of the Pitt history department.Eric
Davin said

Davin was notified by his
lawyer ofthe agreement Monday
afternoon. The local attorney for
the FBI has agreed to release

three of the 41 volumes to Davin
by the end of June. The FBI will
work out a schedule to release
the remaining volumes over the
next 13 months.

Davin compared. the
concession to an out-of-court
settlement with the FBI. “They
have Stated we will get it in
writing that they will release
everything else by next summer,”
Davin said.

“We’re glad to see it, but we’re
not dismissing the lawsuit. We’re
not going to pursue it or request
any court action on it unless they
don’t meet the schedule for
releasing the documents. We
hope this is not just another
stalling tactic by the FBI,” Davin
said.

According to Davin, the local
attorney for the FBI said an analyst
would be assigned to work solely
on this document request. “It
seems that they are sincere about
getting this thing done. In fact
they admitted that six years is a
long time to not have gotten any
documents,” Davin said.

Hypnosis
By Edward Goldhahn
For T be Pitt News -

The only way people can
escape a rut or pattern they can’t
get out of is by isolating
themselves from the negative
pattern by means of meditation
or hypnosis, according to
Pittsburgh Hypnosis Research
Group leader Bill King.

The power of suggestion is the
best universal term to define
hypnosis, King said, as he led
the non—profit hypnosis group's
weekly meeting last week at
Friends Meeting House in
Shadyside.

“Hypnotism is probably most
popular for people with
overeating problems and
people with smoking problems;
that’s where the most money is
made by hypnotists,” King
said. ’

Ironically, statistics show that
hypnosis is least successful in
treating smoking and overeating,

helps students cope

he said.

According to King, “There’s an
ability for people to change, but
they don’t change.

They get stuck in a rut or a bad
situation that was suggested to
them in some way or
another.”

The mind integrates all negative
suggestions from other people
and then rationalizes the
suggestions into accepting and
believing them, he said.

This ability causes people to
convince themselves that they’re
happy and keeps them in ruts.

Meditation is also practiced and
discussed within the hypnosis
group.

“Meditation is the psyche of
experimenting ——§ experimenting
with the mind.

It explores all the avenues
and capabilities of the mind. It’s
not being content with what
average or mediocre mentality
or experience is,” he
said.

“Both hypnosis and meditation
can offer quite a mental clearing,
getting rid of all the things that
are burdening you or weigh-
ing down heavily on
you.

King compared the effects of
meditation to those of
psychoactive drugs.

“Meditation, like drugs, offers
a clearing of all distractions to a
clear mind. Meditation allows you
to free yourself of what everyone
thinks of you, and I think that’s
the underlying reason why
people will experiment with
drugs. It cleans ‘the slate,’ even
for just an hour or two,” he
said.

King suggests all interested new
members of the group choose
one problem they want to
overcome and focus their
attention on that.

He works with his members
using his hypnotic and meditative
techniques to gradually overcome
their problems.

Students protest Israeli
occupation of Gaza Strip

By Heather Gahres
Asst. News Editor

The Muslimb Student Association will be sponsoring a march
on Friday to remind the public of the ‘25 years of Israeli
occupation in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, Samir Khalil said. *

“[The purpose of the march] is to create awareness of the
public in general,” Khalil said.

The Muslim Student Association is comprised of students
from all of the surrounding universities.

Over 80 percent of the students involved are Pitt students,
Khalil said.

The march was originally scheduled for June 5, the 25th
anniversary of the occupation of Eastjerusalem, the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip

However, rain postponed the march.

There were similar demonstrations scheduled to occur
across the country on Saturday, June 6, Khalil said.

The march -is centering on Pitt’s location because it is the
largest university in the area, Khalil said.

The group will meet at the Pittsburgh Islamic Center on
Forbes Avenue Fri., June 12 at 1:45 p.m.

The group will then walk one kilometer to the University of
Pittsburgh.

Continued from page 2
from the FBI. Lasser was the head
of the Unemployed Council of
the Socialist Party of America and

was chosen to be the head of the‘

Workers Alliance organization
jointly created by the Communist
Party of America and the Socialist
Party of America in 1935..

Davin said he couldn’t locate
information about the
organization or Lasser and found
this unusual. “It was a very
important movement. It was the
primary organization of the
unemployed in the ’30s,” Davin
said. '

Davin said he felt this was a
void that needed to be filled. “It’s
virgin territory. Historians are tied
to documents. If there are no
documents, it’s almost like it
doesn’t exist. And there were no
easily accessible documents on

the Workers Alliance. No archives
existed. This really needs to be
explored further,” he said.
Davin considered that the FBI
might have investigated the group
and contacted them. “I didn’t

’ know,” he said. “Maybe they had

nothing. So I filed the request.”
The FBI then told him they had
9,200 documents regarding the
Workers Alliance organization
and another 1,200 on David
Lasser. “I had no idea they had

that much. I said ‘Eureka! I have

struck gold.’ .

“It’s just by sheer accident that
history is preserved,” Davin said.
The Socialist Party of America is
an example. “If it was left up to
the Socialist Party, we would
hardly know that there was a
socialist party in America.”

Due to failing membership in
the 19508, the Socialist Party of

America closed its national office
in New York City and threw
away everything, including the
minutes of meetings, publications,
periodicals, correspondence and
membership records.

“Luckily, the junkman was a
good Capitalist. He knew
someone would pay for this stuff.
He was paid to clean out the
Socialist Party office and then
sold the documents to a rare
paper and ephemera dealer. The
dealer sold it to Duke University,”
Davin said.

Duke University in North
Carolina is now the location of
the archives of the Socialist Party
of America. “The Workers Alliance
was not as lucky. It did not have
a" good junkman On the scene.
When it folded up in 1940, they
trashed everything,” Davin said.

Davin has made arrangements

to archive the documents so that
they can be used by other
scholars. The Workers Alliance
information will be sent to the
Tamiment Library at New York
University. Tamiment Library is a
major repository of labor and
leftist documents. “I am sure that
a lot of publications in the future
will result from it,” Davin said.

James Lorence, a history
professor at the University of
Wisconsin, is also writing a book
about the Workers Alliance.
Lorence filed his Freedom of
Information request over four
years ago. “I’m quite pleased,”
Lorence said. “This is possibly
just in time to do one more version
of my manuscript.”

Lorence states that the FBI may
still edit 80 percent of the
documents. “On one occasion, I
received 25 percent of what I had

requested,” Lorence said.

“Sure they'll be edited,” agrees
Davin. “They black out stuff that
is entirely trivial as far as we can
tell.” Davin discovered this during
a previous Freedom of
Information Act request on a leftist
poet who died in 1948.

The poet had lived in New
York City, so Davin applied to
both the New York City office of
the FBI and its national
headquarters. “I got the same

document released from both 8

offices. The New York office
crossed out some things on this
document, whereas [Washington]
D.C. would cross out other
things."

To Davin, the crossed—out items
were trivial and harmless. “For
example, ‘... they met and had tea
with their friends ...’ What's the
danger in that?” Davin said.

Free speech defended

American universities continue to mirror social problems
in the country. On June 8, a federal appeals court in New
York affirmed at lower court’s ruling against City College,
adding another chapter to the continuing racial tensions
in American universities.

Dr. Michael Levin charged that college officials violated
his free-speech and due-process rights. Levin, a philosophy
professor, published letters and articles asserting blacks
on average were “significantly less intelligent” than
whites. Levin made no such claims in class — his
comments were outside the university setting. However

’ campus reaction was quick, drawing student protests in

Levin’s classes.

In response, the City College developed parallel courses
for offended students, did not stop classroom disruptions
and set up an investigative committee to examine Levin.

The court agreed Levin’s academic and constitutional

rights were violated, stating, “It is the chilling effect on
free speech that violates the First Amendment, and it is
plain that an implicit threat can chill as forcibly as an
explicit threat.”

just three days prior to this decision another tenured
professor, Dr. Leonard jeffries, Jr, filed a $25 million
lawsuit against the City College for violating his civilrights
by dismissing him as chair of the Black Studies Department.
Both instructors inﬂamed campus racial divisions --
jeffries caused an uproar over his anti—Semitic
views.

Free speech is a peculiar term. In these instances it can
be successfully argued that a First-Amendment violation
occurred. '

Clearly, investigative committees raise questions about
the college's authority to scrutinize opinion and dialogue.

If“ ‘claii'r‘1§“<')‘f’ ’ ra‘cism' 1' in the ’ classroom? were present, an “

investigation would be appropriate for possible civil-
rights violations. 4

Classroom demonstrations offer students the ability to
express contempt against bigotry, but not allowing an
instructor the ability to teach oversteps those bounds. As
with many struggles that call for civil disobedience,
individuals must face criminal penalties challenging
oppressive law. However, no law was being challenged
in this circumstance — an individual was under
attack. _

Surely no one should be forced to take this man’s course
— other sections, if not special sections, should exist.
Levin was not charged with bigotry in the class. Free
speech gives students theability to fight bigotry. Fighting
racism is only aided by one’s ability to attack prejudice in
an open environment.

The court was correct to defend Levin’s First Amendment
rights. These rights defend the righteous and the
bigots.

The concept that we Americans
take for granted the most is that-
of freedom of ideas. This freedom
is recognized by the First
Amendment to the Constitution,
and it guarantees freedom in
several ways. The most notable is
that of free speech itself, but it
also prohibits government

‘ intervention within the practice

of religion.

While religion’s importance has
been overshadowed in recent
years, the FirstAmendment rights
concerning religion have been
important in this country since
before its official inception.

Contrary to popular opinion,
the United States was never
intended to be a “Christian”
nation. The first settlers were
ﬂeeing religion—based bigotry and
persecution. To them, having
been denied the right to worship
as they. pleased, the idea of
denying others that same right
was anathematic. -

These memories were still fresh
in the collective memory when
the Founding Fathers drafted the
Constitution and the Bill of

Rights.
Large-scale social forces in this
country swing between

individualism and conformity. As
problems in a society increase,
there is a tendency to push for
more conformity. This makes
people more comfortable because
it decreases the number of
“outsiders” and makes people
feel they are part of a larger
group (“safety in numbers”).

The government has been using
this phenomenon to its own
advantage.

In recent years, the government
has acted to reduce individual
liberties and enforce “order.” This
provides a dual purpose: it makes
the masses feel more secure, and
it increases the government’s

A power and authority. Many

freedoms are currently under
attack: an artist’s right to free
expression, the people’s Second-
Amendment rights and the right
to free speech itself. Ironically

enough,not only the government ,

but also the “Politically Correct”
movement is chipping away at
our rights to free speech.

In one of its rulings

J David
Winters  

(Employment Division Oregon
DepartmentofHuman Resources
U. Smith), the Supreme Court has
harnstrung the religious freedom
clause of the First Amendment.

_ Before Smith, the government
was only permitted to intervene
in a particular religious practice if
it could provide deﬁnite reasons
for doing so.

Following this ruling, there is
virtually nothing preventing
governmental interference in
private religion. .

In Minnesota it was cited in an
attempt to infringe upon the
Amish community. Because of
the Smith decision, an autopsy
was performed in Michigan even
though it violated the boy’s
Orthodox Jewish faith. To this
date it has been used in more
than a dozen intrusive cases of
this nature.

There is absolutely no limit to
the amou nt of damage to religious
expression that this precedent
can cause. There is also no
religious sect that is safe from
interference. To date, I know that
the Amish, Jewish and Native
American faiths have all been
adversely affected by this
precedent. Tomorrow it very well
could be Quakers, Roman
Catholics, Muslims or Baptists.

There is another angle to the

Religious freedom under attac/e

freedom of religion clause, one
that is overlooked in this age of
religious attempts at political
influence and televised
evangelism: in a very real way, it
also guarantees the people’s right
to be free from religion, if they so
choose. Smith could be cited in
an attempt to force atheists, New
Age individuals, spiritualists or
other religious sects deemed
“heathen” and “blasphemous” to
convert to whatever religion the
government officials deem
“acceptable.”

To counter this, the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act has been

J introduced into the House. If

signed into law, it would prohibit
the government from interfering
in religious practiceunless it can
prove (I) it has a compelling
purpose to do so and (2) it is
interfering in the least intrusive
manner.

This will simply and effectively
force the government to keep
itself out of the private practice of
religion. ’ ‘

At the present time the
government has a “Big Brother”
view of itself, and it is interfering
in public and private life’in a
manner never intended when this
country was formed.

Because it fears for its power,
the government is afraid of
individualism, and it attempts «to
force conformity wherever
possible. Unless concrete checks
are put on its actions, ' it will
continue to grow until it becomes
stagnant and the United States
becomes a police state.

Sadly, just as communism and
state-backed socialism are being
discarded by most of the rest of
the world, this country is rushing
toward it with open arms.

Howards End, the latest
adaptation of an E..M. Forster
.novel transposed onto the big
screen, does justice to the writer's
legacy, much more than previous
screenplays A Passage To India
and Maurice did. ‘

Both were directed by this film’s
visionary, James Ivory.

Set in the 1920s urban and
provincial life of London, England,
one sees the intercon-
nectedness of three intrinsically
different families:The Wilcox
clan, which claims the title of
the stately,= country home,
Howards End; the Schlegel sisters
and brother, who fancy
themselves as modern-thinking
and liberated; and the young
Leonard and Jacky Bast, who live
in a small and. squalid London
flat. _

Cutting to the chase without
giving away the meat of the
plot, we find these disparate clans
fused together by the
acquaintance, and later firm

friendship, that is forged between B

Margaret Schlegel (played by
Emma Thompson) and Ruth
Wilcox (played by .Vanessa
Redgrave).

Margaret invites Ruth ‘to attend
a luncheon, and during its
course we see an undercurrent
that guides the film for its
remainder: how to find good help
in London, a concern of Ruth
due to her recent move to the
city. ' ,

Margaret, on the other hand,
does not share Ruth’s problem
because she trusts her servant,
Aunt Juley, implicitly.

The second and most thorny
topic of lunch- is the suffrage
movement.

Young Helen Schlegel spiritedly
argues for the vote, and she nearly
receives a consensus from the
other luncheon guests but for one
—— Mrs Wilcox. She is thankful
that she does not have the right to
vote and expounds this by saying

pursuit of politics, causing an
awkward moment and a
pregnant pause in the
conversation. As the guests
adjourn, Margaret, who feels
that Ruth’s sen-sibilities have
been offended, asks her if she
has enjoyed her visit.

Ruth responds affirmatively
and begs her pardon, saying
that she has not been feeling
well and she feared her company

wasn't adequate due, to her

failing health.

Thus their quibbling over
current events was simply that,
and an unspoken friend-
ship, based upon mutual
admiration is forged.

Nowhere is this better seen
than within the eyes and facial
expressions of one of the finest
actors of the 20th century,
Vanessa Redgrave.

The Bast clan is weaved into

‘Helena Bonharn Carter and Sam West star in Howards End.

between young Helen Schlegel
and Leonard Bast, who sit
alongside each other at a music-
appreciation lecture of
Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony —
a fitting piece that essentially
chronicles the tragic fate of poor
Leonard. Helen, in a fit of
undefined rage which she is
inclined to experience," rushes
out mid—lecture.

Leonard follows her all the
way to her ﬂat and comes cal-
ling under the pretext of
retrieving an umbrella that Helen
mistakenly pinched
him. .

The encounter between the

two is brief, but it has all the ‘

markings of boy-meets—girl,'
especially with the pseudo—rap
laid by young Helen's dropping
of her calling card on poor
Leonard.

Both Helen and Maragaret are

the confines of his circumstances,

greater.

Margaret calls him a born

for stargazing and late—night
walks. She further tries to help
Leonard risein the professional
world by asking Henry Wilcox
(enter Anthony Hopkins) if he
could give Leonard a position in
his trading firm. Wilcox declines,
saying that no positions are
available, but as a con-
solation offers her some" inside
advice.

So here is Hopkins, playing a

British_ capitalist, ,O.f, , German’
"descent who strikes up the other

boy—meets—girl scenario with
Maragaret.

He does this with a fluent
exchange of German. Of course
this is post—Ruth, who has

Hopkins’ character is the true
blending of English refined
sensibilities with Teutonic
strictness and order. A good clue

As the chef carves a prime rib
alongside the chatterings of
Margaret and Henry, Henry
adroitly pulls‘ out three
shillings and dispatches a tip to
the chef, advising her that it
is always right to tip the

As technical things go, the

cinematography is a knockout.
The camera seems to adopt a
sensual quality, showing the

Ind1e Fest 92 goes coast to coas or e roe
By Heidi Glenn ’ A if C  I
Staﬂ’ Writer

In a town where one—upman’ship reigns supreme, look forward to
an appropriately impressive night of indie rock galore on Tues., June
16. Yes, it’s better than that day—long Perry F. schmaltz, and it’s
showcasing four outta town bands on one bill. WPTS(98.5 FM) and
WRCT(88.3 FM) activate their wonderpowers and proudly welcome
Pavement, Rein Sanction, Cake Kitchen and Toiling Midgets to the
William Pitt Union Ballroom on June 16.

Ask any local yokel, coffee—swillin’ sub/urbanite to name the
better-than-sliced-bread band for this week, and you’ll probably hear .
a puss-faced cheer for Pavement. I’d place money on it. It seems that
this Stockton, Calif, band which intended to play three weeks a year
has become the buzzword of the year and the members are probably
scratching their heads at their “success.” Their recently released’
“Slanted and Enchanted” on Matador has been praised ad nauseam
in just about every rock rag printed‘ nowadays, and heavies in the
tastemaking business have ordained them Best Art Rock Band.

Why should you pay to let some guys from Cali do something that
you could and should have been doing in your basement long ago?
Because they're good. Damn good. Pavement sounds like someone
‘we know and can sometimes place (comparisons to rock staples like

Also, you get the dank and
dark disgust of the Basts’
tenement, which for many of
us in our twenties is an all-too-
real portrayal.

One faultl give to the ﬂick is
in editing. Two very emotive _
scenes, one between Ruth and
Helen and the other with Helen
and Henry, are botched by
choppy fade-ins and -outs
that are supposed to signify
the old “time passes”
schtick.

It’s just plain stupid, and it
destroys the mood of true
confession. But hey, it’s a film
trying to cram a 300-page book
into two hours and 20 minutes
of footage. Back in the old
pictures, they would only use
short stories for screenplays,

like Capra’s Meet John
Doe. , v
But all in all it’s a solid
production, worthy of your
time and money, and it serves
well to whet your whistle for
a further examination of
Forster’s work.

The characters are very
complex, and this film
demonstrates that. Who
would think that a woman
who is against the suffrage
movement would be the
catalyst for so much dynamic
change within the lives of
three such different families?
Ruth Wilcox’s legacy is not
simply a contradiction, it is a
paradox.‘

Indie

Continued from page 7
Velvet Underground, the Fall and
Swell Maps are often used), but
then they comb it with a backhoe
until it’s pulp. Their lo-lo-fi
schlock combines gnawing guitar
gravel, . chafing feedback and
sandpaper static with an
identifiable hum.

Some may say they’re basking
in raison d’etre sunlight for their
hard work and (ahem) pavement
pounding. I mean, you don't get
to be Spz'n’s Platter du Jour (March
1992) without a modicum of
schmoozing, right? Wrong. The
members have been
conspicuously elusive: no
interviews, no band photos, no
musician identification on
records. Intentional planning or
plain ol’ luck, Pavement has
prescribed the perfect formula
with a seemingly anti—hit

sentiment. It appears to be a bit
bitter that the Wedding Present-
covered “Box Elder” from the
band’s first 7" (on its own label)
— exposure ain’t exposure unles
it’s good, I guess. *
After two 7"s and one helluva
10'' (both on Chicago's Drag City
label), the long-awaited “Slanted
and Enchanted” satiated some

but left others salivating for more P

soon after. Here’s your chance to
fill your tank with the band's bag
of tricks. P.S.: I hear they’re pretty
cute, too.

Not to be outdone or
overshadowed by Pavement is
Florida's claim to Sub Pop fame,
Rein Sanction. The “Broc’s Cabin”
release in 1991 was produced by
that Shimmy-guru—guy, Kramer.
The two major selling points aside,
Rein Sanction spews hard—hitting
stomp and splashy distortion 

can you really not rely on the
Sub Pop branding iron for
this?

Dubbed “New Zealand’s Sonic
Youth,” Homestead recording
artist Cake Kitchen takes the
speed ride on the love train to
ensconce us in its delicate vocals
and guitar mush. A

And last (but not yeast) is San
Fran’s Toiling Midgets. Don’t
expect any Thinking Fellers
quirky business — the Matador
7" I heard slurps white-hot
bombast.

Indie rock will never die like
punk rock did if you bring your
bread to the WPU Ballroom on
Tues., June 16. Pay homage to
Pavement, Rein Sanction, Cake
Kitchen and Toiling Midgets, and
maybe even see some of your
favorite D-jocks starting at 7p.m.
Yay for Indie Fest ’92.

Carmela Mariani is a star athlete
almost by accident. She began
running while a freshman in high
school.

—“It was something to do,
something to be involved with,”
Mariani said. She chose distance
running over any other kind of
running because, “It’s all I could
do. I’m not very fast. It was
something I was decent at.”

The junior distance runner has
gone from being “decent” at
something to becoming an All-
American. Sh_e’s coming off her
best season at Pitt, but she said
the whole year wasn’t as good as
the NCAA ﬁnals.

“The year didn’t start that well,”
she said. “I had a good cross-
country season and [the indoor
season] was a little shaky, but
towards’ the end, everything
started to look pretty good. Then
came [the outdoor season]. There
weren’t too many meets and the
weather wasn’t very good, but I
just had one good race. I gues
that's all it takes.” -

That one good race was at the
Penn Relays, a meet in which she

Pens: great but no dynasty

set Pitt’s record in the 10,000
meters.

Then at last Wednesday’s NCAA
Division I Track and Field
Championships in Austin, Texas,
the Pittsburgh native and Taylor-
Allderdice graduate finished sixth
in the 10,000 meters to become
the first women’s distance runner
in Pitt’s history to earn A11-

« American honors. Her time of

35:12.17 in the 10,000 meters was
enough to place her in the top
eight and secure her All-American
status. _ P

The weather conditions in
Texas were hardly ideal for strong
distance running. Mariani
described the conditions as
horrible.

“It was unbelievably humid,”
she said. “I kept telling myself,
‘It’s [The race is] going to be at
night, it’s going to be better.’ I

hoped I was ready.I started out’

in back. I try to run as consistent
as possible. That’s what worked
for me at the Penn Relays.

“I slowly started to pass people,
and I got to a point to where I was
in the top eight. Coach [Jim] Lear
cheered me on the last four laps.
It was a great feeling. I felt like
pinching myself after it was done.”

She said she feels the coaches
at Pitt are great, especially Lear,
the men’s and women’s distance
coach. “He’s very good at what
he does. I can’tsay enough about
him. He doesn’t put any pressure
on you. He leaves it to you.'He
wants you to do what you can
do; no more, no less.”

She also gave a lot of credit to
her parents, Dominec and
Domineca. “My parents’ support
helps a lot. My mom's very
encouraging. Whenever I get
down, she picks me up.” She

- said her parents wanted to attend

the championships, but they
couldn’t because of its distant
location. They usually attend local
meets in which their daughter
competes.

Mariani, a biology major and a
Big East Academic All-Star, said
that balancing track and.
schoolwork is tough. She said
she feels that it’s important to
stay disciplined, adding that she
works better if she has a schedule.

In her three years of running at
Pitt, she said she’s learned to
respect the opposition. “In high
school-[track] people would do
well, but they did it to have a
good time. Now everyone’s great

and a lot of work goes into it, so
you get a lot of respect for them
because you know what it" takes
to be there.”

Women's Head Coach Steve
Lewis found it easy to explain

Mariani as a runner. “Three words

said she has gotten better every
meet of every year. He said her
performance at
championships was a “major
accomplishment.”

Cup run to be annual affair

the ’

The Penguins’ fans are buzzin’ to the
tune of a possible hockey dynasty in
Pittsburgh for years to come. That theory
does hold some water. After all, the Pens
just won back—to—back Stanley Cup
Championships. And next year’s team
should "be healthier

long shot. Super Mario could be crippled
at the drop of a puck due to his sporadic
back spasms. Perhaps he_ could be
grounded for good much- sooner than
expected, so he cannot be the foundation
upon which to build. "

problem? '

Well I wish I. had a dollar every time a
team was supposed to win another
championship or was supposed to be a
dynasty in the making. How many people
chose the Pittsburgh Steelers to win three
super bowls in a row?

When pondering the future of the
Pittsburgh Penguins, remember these
points: _

It is true that Pittsburgh has the most
talented player in hockey in Mario Lemieux,
but he is not the healthiest player by a

the role of the new
management. There is still a mystery in the
intentions of the new owners, Howard
Baldwin, Morris Belzberg and others.

‘Are their true intentions to own an NHL
hockey team for the long term or to turn
a quick profit? The two do not go hand in
hand.

, Itwas Baldwin and company who wasted
no time in trading Paul Coffey, who just
happened to be the Penguins’ second
highest-paid player on the team.It was
also the new management which decided

head in Pittsburgh

these days because the Stanley Cup
Champions are just that young, talented
team to become the next dynasty in hockey.

The Pens showed how good they could
be as they won the Cup last season. This
year they proved how’ great they are.

It all starts with the superstars. Mario
Lemieux , the best player in the world,
heads that list, but he is no longer alone.
Lemieux is complemented by two of the
top power forwards in _the game, Kevin
Stevens and Rick Tocchet. Stevens set a
new scoring record for left wingers this
year, and Tocchet regained his all-star

, goalie in the regular
season, when his teammates often forget
to play defense, but he has been great
during the playoffs in the last two seasons.
Barrasso has been at least as important as
Super Mario to the Pens as they won the
Cup the last two years. _

There is talent, and there is youth.
Barrasso and Lemieux seem to have been
around forever, especially to opponents,
but are only 27 and 26 years old
respectively. Even older players, such as
Tocchet and Francis, should be around
for another four or five seasons. -

Bonilla’s homecoming tarnished by cheap seat assault

Ugly: adj, I. offensive to the
sight, hideous." 2. Pirate fans when
the Mets visit Pittsburgh.

This past weekend marked the
much anticipated return of Bobby
Bonilla to Three Rivers Stadium.
Since Bonilla’s defection to the
hated New York Mets last fall,
Pirate fans have diligently berated
the smiling superstar. But the
harmless, jealous rantings of
ungrateful fans turned ugly when
a fan (if that is what he deserves
to be called) fired a golf ball at
Bonilla’s head, forcing him to
play right ﬁeld with a batting
helmet on.

This inexcusable act is an
embarrassment to every sports
fan in Pittsburgh, but it is not an
isolated occurrence. Fans threw

batteries at right fielder Dave
Parker when he was still playing
in a Pirates uniform. And even if
the golf ball incident didn’t
happen, the behavior of Pirate
fans resembles that of a spoiled
child.

Bonilla, along with Doug
Drabek and Barry Bonds,
resuscitated a dying baseball
franchise. He helped lead a team
that was for years a civic
embarrassment to two
consecutive National League East
championships, and he did it
with a smile and gracious charm
that is rare among today's baseball

superstars.

How soon Bucco fans seem to
have forgotten what Bonilla
meant to Pittsburgh. Remember

spring training last year? Bonilla
served as a buffer between Jim
Leyland, the press and the volatile
Barry Bonds, perhaps keeping
the National League East
champion Pirates from self-

Jim Lakely

destructing. And how did the
Pirates’ faithful welcome this
generous player who never failed
to give 100 percent for the team?
With a chorus of boos that echoed
through the rafters of the stadium,
and this was in front of every
television set in the city.

The most troubling aspect of
this whole episode is what

motivates a fan to display such
vile conduct. Bonds said the abuse
his good friend Bonilla suffered
was racially motivated.
“It’s a black thing of course,”
Bonds told New York Newsday.
“You’re telling me the fans would
have done the same thing to
Andy Van Slyke, Mr. Pittsburgh?”
. Bonds’ statement may come
from deep left field, but there is
evidence to support it.
Following the 1990 season, first
baseman Sid Bream left the Pirates
for the bigger bucks and greener
pastures of Atlanta. Bream, a solid
fielder, was instrumental in
helping the Braves beat the Pirates
for the National _ League
Championship last year. Despite
the fact that Bream’s efforts helped

keep the Pirates out ofthe World
Series, he has been welcomed
back to Three Rivers Stadium
with standing ovations. Bream is
white.

Bream was indeed a solid and
popular player, but his talents
and contributions to the Pirates
do not compare to Bonilla’s. Yet
Bonilla is abused. Bonilla is black.

Is the difference in crowd
reception directly related to the
color of the player’s skin? Perhaps
it is. If it was related to merit, they
should have been throwing roses
at Bonilla, not golf balls. With all
other factors being equal to
Bream’s, it is a safe conclusion
that Bonilla was booed because

he was a black man making big 0

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, June 10, 1992

Buncher

Continued from Page 9

Age is an immediate concern
only in the cases of Bryan Trottier,
Kjell Samuelsson and Gordie
Roberts.

As age claims some of the
Penguins, youngsters like Shawn
McEachern and Markus Naslund
will step in. McEachern came on
late in the season and played
well. Everyone knew he had
great speed and could score, but
he also showed great strength,
defensive ability and a willingness
to throw his body around.

The Penguins also have the
ability to play any style. They
have so much offensive talent
that they can outgun any team in
the league in a shootout. They
can also back off and play
defense. The Pens have enough
big players to play a physical
game and the speed to blow by
opponents. They have top-notch

grinders to play along the boards.
There is no one style that can
beat this team.

Neither can bad luck: The loss
of Head Coach Bob Johnson to
cancer was devastating. Holdouts
followed, and Lemieux’s back
continued to be a problem. The
sale of the team was a distraction,
as were continuing trade rumors
involving Paul Coffey, until the
deal was finally made. just when
the team finally put it all together,
ripping off an 11-4-1 streak, the
players’ strike broke their
momentum.

Once the playoffs finally
started, the Penguins came back
from a 3-1 deficit to beat
Washington in the first round
and were forced to defeat the
Rangers mostly without Lemieux.
The Pens showed they cannot
only deal with adversity, they
thrive on it.

They willprobably need that
ability to deal with adversity again
next season. It is looking more
and more_like Scotty Bowman,
arguably the best coach in NHL
history, will not return as the
Pens’ coach. Lemieux’s back will
continue to be a problem. A
possible holdout by Barrasso is a
concern, and the team could lose
Mullen or Bourque to free agency.

The Penguins do have one
major ace up their sleeve —
General Manager Craig Patrick.
He has done a masterful job
building this team since taking
over during the ’89—’90 season.
He" has proven that he can
continually make adjustments to
the roster as needed.Having the
best GM inhockey is_the best
argument of all for throwing the
d-word around in Pittsburgh.

money outside of Pittsburgh. To
say that Bonilla’s verbal. and
physical assault is not (at least
partially) racially motivated is to
brush’ a serious problem under
the astroturf. A

The New York fans are the
ones who are supposed to be
violent and rude, but although
Mets fans boo poor efforts on the
field, they do not uphold a
tradition of physically assaulting
baseball players.

Bonilla tried to negotiate a
contract to stay with the Pirates,
but club management would not
meet his demands. Bonilla later
stated that if they had negotiated
seriously and in good faith earlier
in the 1991 season, he would
have stayed in Pittsburgh for less
than the $29 million he now gets
from the Mets.

The fans in this town do not
remember that little detail either.
Instead of finding fault with
management, Bonilla is labeled a
money-grubbing traitor,
unworthy of respect.

Let’s look at the way the Pirates
have ' handled contract
negotiations: Van Slyke, Zane
Smith and Steve Beuchele had all
signed multi—million dollar
contract extensions, while Bonilla
was being locked out of
Pittsburgh’s future.

By the way, negotiations
continue with Doug Drabek for a’
big-bucks, multi—year deal, while
negotiations with Bonds have
been closed for months. Is it just
coincidence that white superstars

' sign for big contracts while black

stars move to different clubs?

If this is the way great players
get treated by the city of
Pittsburgh, then indeed the
franchise should have moved out
when it had the chance. If this is
the way Pittsburgh fans reward a
champion, then it does not
deserve one.

When Bonds leaves the Pirates
at the end of this season, he
should try to latch on to an
American League team. Because
if this is the way Pirate fans react
to an amiable superstar’s return,
what would happen to a man as
grating as Bonds? Security had
better check for guns at the gates.
