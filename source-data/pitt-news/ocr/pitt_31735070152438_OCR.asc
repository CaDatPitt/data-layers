Pitt professor uses social Work
to treat emotional disorder

Joelle Smith
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

When the ﬁrst trial of Cognitive Enhance-
ment Therapyto treat schizophrenic indi-
viduals ran in 2004, Shaun Eack said it was
met with some skepticism. ' '

“There was a whole series of articles
saying the brain and schizophrenia can not
be changed — and it sure as hell can’t be
changed by a social worker,” Eack said.

That was the case until the development
of Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET),
a rehabilitation program intended to treat
individuals suffering from schizophrenia
through brain—stitnulating exercises.

Eack, an assistant professor in Pitt’s
School of Social Work, explained the details
of the rehabilitation-program in a lecture en-
titled “Social Work Interventions to Improve
Cognition and Recovery of Schizophrenia
and Autism” Wednesday at noon in Room
2017 of the Cathedral of Learning as part of

  ' ‘ '”
_ Lad .-
C’

ss    S 

the School of Social Work’s lecture series.
Eack said he and his late predecessor,

Jerry Hogarty, a former professor in Pitt’s

School of Medicine, faced a lot of opposi-

tion while establishing the program. Oppo- ~

nents said research on schizophreniawas not

within a social worker’s realm. But according‘

to Eack, he and his team of researchers are
proving these skeptics wrong.
He_said the premise of the study sprung

' from research Hogarty conducted in the late

1990s. By.drawing from a compilation of
existing literature, Hogarty came to a vital
conclusion.

“The problems that people who suffer
from schizophrenia have in their thinking
and cognition  _are really challenges that
many individuals experience at the adoles-
cent and preadolescent stages of cognitive
development,” Eack said. i ‘

Based on this assertion, the team worked,

wished to remain anonymous.

“They are all in inner—city schools,”
Primack said. “We focused on them be-
cause that’s where smoking is more of a
problem.” _ .

The class focused on empoweri g the
ninth graders to analyze and evaluate the
messages that the media circulates.

According to Primack, media literacy
is an issue that is becoming increasingly
important in today’s society that exposes
teens to messages in social media, televi-

. sion and music.

Brenton Malin, a communications pro-
fessor at Pitt, said media literacy enables
viewers to discern how the media is made
and how its messages should be received.

Malin added that media literate viewers
should'be thinking about what they’re see-
ing and how they’re “supposed to be seeing
it and then determine how the creator of
the message wants them to -see it.

“Critically thinking about how the
media is made forces people to be more

skeptical of what they are seeing,” he said.

Malin said that regardless of an ad-
vertisement’s goals, the media still has a
heavy effect on individuals.

“Advertising affects everyone directly.
It mighfnot be that it gets people” to buy
products, but it deﬁnitely gets people to
think things are cool,” he said.

Malin added that smoking has long
been associated with being cool and re-
bellious. ‘

“It’s one of those things that if you want
to make someone seem cool, you can show
them smoking,” he said.

Advertisements for smoking have been
widely curbed by sanctions such as the
surgeon general’s warning and the ban
of cigarette ads on television. On April 1,
1970, then—U.S. President Richard Nixon
signed legislation that banned cigarette
advertising on television and radio.

According to Primack’s results, becom-
ing more literate in media could, inﬁfact,
alter teenagers’ decisions.

The study showed positive results in

, terms of responses to media. After the

l_ECTURE   

to /develop a rehabilitation program to give

schizophrenic individuals the ability to spur °
their cognitive development through a series -
. of exercises. Instead of trying to rehabilitate

the brain through medicine, Eack hopes to

renew its ﬁmctions through social-and logi- Z

cal activity.

The long—term program incorporates
CET, which engages schizophrenic individ-
uals in neurocognitive training and social
cognitive group therapy so they can return
to the workforce. ' _ A

.Neurocognitive training requires indi-

viduals to complete various programs via‘

computer.

Eack demonstrated a sample program-

in which shapes ﬂash across a screen and
users name the shapes from memory. He
said such activities will improve brain ﬁmc-
tions such as basic logic, problem solving
and memory skills that are often impaired
by schizophrenia. .

Social cognitive group therapy involves
.a group of people enacting various social

scenarios. Activities in the group sessions
prompt the participants to empathize and
see from the perspective of another indi-
vidual. Social interaction is key for schizo-
phrenics, Eack said.

“But a group  isan extremely powerful

b settingforworking on problems associated

with social cognition and social skill,” he
said. .
Eacksaid the rehabilitation program may
affect those who suffer from other emotional
disorders. He and his research team are de-
veloping a preliminary program that will
incorporate a majority of the CET methods
to treat individuals suffering from autism.
Eack said the similarities between
emotional disorders such as autism and
schizophrenia ‘make it easy to convert the

rehabilitationprogram. Such a program is -
. desperately needed in the adult autism com-

munity, Eack said. . .
“Since 1960, the number of psychosocial
treatment published studies for adults with
autism spectrum disorder — I can ﬁt on one
slide.” Eack said. “We know nothing about
how to treat adults with autism spectrum
disorder, let alone about how to improve
cognition.” -

wer 

This lack of research challenged him to
translate the CET to autistic individuals, he
said.

Kristen West, afreshman majoringin psy-
chology, said she was shocked by the dearth
of research in treating emotional disorders.

She added that she was unaware of “the
need for an increase in outreach.”

, Edie Brozanski worked with Eack as a stu-
dent before she graduated from the School of
Social Work in 2010. After researching Eack’s
latest work on CET, Brozanski stressed the
value of the program.

“Anything to assist people with schizo-
phrenia is so important because it’s such
a debilitating mental-health issue, and I’m
very interested in tha ,”‘she said. ‘

_ Monica Ceraso, an administrative assis-
tant at the School of Social Work, helped to
organize the lecture series. She said she was

' not only impressed with Eack’s presentation,

but also with his career as a researcher.

“I would not have thought, personally,
that social—work intervention could actually
help with an illness such as schizophrenia
and autism,” Ceraso said. “The way he ex-
plains the outcomes of these studies — it’s
just fascinating.” I

They are the ones who'chaper—
one prom in order to watch their
daughter and make sure her date
stays three feet away at all times.
‘They are the ones who visit you
in college every single weekend.
Having a helicopter parent is
kind of like having a conjoined
twin, only instead of being at-
tached to a look—alike version of
' yourself, you’re connected to a
woman in hair curlers clutching
a Nikon D7100 who keeps wallet
photos of you in her purse that
she likes to hand out whenever
you casually come up in conver-
sation — which is all the time
because her life revolves around

you.
It may seem like I’m jok-

ing, but helicopter parents are
becoming a serious problem.

.. Google the phrase “helicopter

paren ” and you’re barraged with
articles bearing titles such as,
“Hover no more: Helicopter par-
ents may breed depression and
incompetence in their children,”
“How helicopter parents can ruin
a kid’s job prospects” and “He—
licopter parents have neurotic
kids.” These aren’t from hack
sites, mind you‘ —— that second
headline is pulled straight from
CNN. . .

I was confronted with a he-
licopter parent situation earlier
this semester when one of my
professors told me he had a stu—
dent whose mother tweeted him.

Now take a second to think about
that. Not only does this mother
presumably know the names of
all her’child’s professors, but she
took the time to ﬁnd them on
social media sites and send one
of them a message. That’s ter-
rifying. My parents can’t even
remember what street I live on,
let alone my class schedule and
professors.
Just because we live in the In-
formation Age and it’s easier to
connect with one another than
ever before doesn’t mean you
. have to be connected with your
parents all the time, on all dif-
ferent platforms. It’s good that
you’re not Facebook friends with

your parents or, more drastically, -

parents not conducive to * growth of their children

that they don’t know your pass-
word and can secretly check up
on you (this is a real thing, trust
me). Privacy is helpful to. every-
one, especially at this age. -
Before I went abroad, I friend-
ed my parents on Facebook so
that I wouldn’t have to individu-
ally email them every picture I
uploaded. After I got back, my

. dad told me that nowwquld be a

good time to unfriencl him and all
the other adults that friended me
while I was away because it was
a natural ending point.

POTENT POTABLES

East End BrewingCoi. makes creativity pay off at festival by

Jackson Crowder _
Staff" Writer

East End Brewing Co. has always placed apre-
mium on community. Local quality always
trumped national recognition for the small
brewery, and its slogan is as neighborly as
can be: “Buya goodfriend agood beer._”Atthe
beginning o_fthis month, East End once 
reached‘ out to the Pittsburgh community,
this time inlthe annual Festival of Darkness.

Though it sounds like a heavy-metal con-‘ '

cert to rival Ozz-fest, Festival of Darkness is '
actually a celebration of dark beer. For a mere
$5 ——‘all of which goes to support Light 'of
Life Ministries, alocal ministry that as_sists
the homeless — lovers of good beer came to
sample EastEnd’s darkest offerings. b
There is some disagreement within the
small ranks‘ of East End as to when Festival
of Darkness started. Company founder and
CEO Scott Smith admitted that even hehad
to use Google to ﬁnd the earliest reference.

It supposedly began in‘2oo_'7,- but there is '

still suspicion that the event goes back even
further and no one seemsto know for sure.
In any case, an event that started with three
beers on tap has grown to feature 12 and has
become a marquee tastingfor local craftbeer

-enthusiasts.

Perhaps because of its bleak na_ture,winter

has always been the prime season for big,

malty, dark beers that warm the body and

- put a smile on your face. Smith seemed to buy

into that idea, saying, “We?ve been, fora long
time, in love with the notionlofhelping people

with their seasonal-depression by putting a ”

whole bunch of dark beer into their hands.”
Referencing the traditional association of
darkbeers with winter, as well as Pittsburgh’s

recentarcticclimate,Smithsaid,“[Darkbeer] ‘

is a greatway to carry you through the winter,
ainice fur coat to carry into spring.” Despite
its name, Festivalof Darkness features a di-
verse selection of beers that ranged instyle

from relatively light Scottish gruits to imperial

stouts the color of crude oil.

hind the bar pressed a sample glass of East
End’s Toaster Imperial Stout into my hands.
True to its classiﬁcation, the beer’s head was
a deep, chocolate brown and light failed to
penetrate through it even when held up to

a bulb. It smelled of rich roasted malt with a _
' lingering alcoholic sweetness that forewarned

of an abusive sip, but, unlike many imperial
stouts (which can feel like drinking a glass of
thick paint), Toasterwas smooth and forgiv-
ing. As Ifenjoyed the ﬁrst of many morning
beer samples, Smith said that Toaster was a
Festival of Darkness veteran and, true to the

brewery’s ﬂexible timeline, it was either four -
' or ﬁve years old, leading Smith the dub it “the

ﬁfth anniversary of our fourth anniversary.”
Next came a palate cleanserin the form

of the decidedly light Honey Heather Ale. ‘

This beer, unlike Toaster; was no stranger to
me, having had it atThe Porch more than a
fewtimes. Still, its subtléherbaceous quality
coupled with the sweet punch of Pittsburgh

honey (courtesy of The Porch’s bees) made it _

‘delicate and robust all at once.

Abeerthatlhad never sampled beforewas
Lord Nordsberry Belgian Ale, East End’s take

. on a Belgian dark ale brewed with raspber-

ries. Where most Belgian darks are thick and
heavy, Lord Nordsberry—— named for Nordy
(not that Nordy), one of East End’s brewers,
Nordy Siljander, —- was anything but. Con-
traryto my expectations, the medium—brown
ale was light and effervescent with a soda—like
carbonation. The ﬂavor of the raspberries
came through but was not so dominant as to

4 snuif out the malt, makingthis awell-balanced

and easily drinkable beer. Unlike many of
its Belgian counterparts, Lord Nordsberry
was designed to be sessionable, with an ABV
of only 6 percent. Easily my favorite beer of
the day, I bought a half growler (32 ounces)
afterwards.

Amid all of the quality dark beer ﬂowing
into my glass, there was one that the staff
seemed particularly keen for me to try --
Smokestack Heritage Porter. Normally I’_rn

For all of its earnest, heavy-handed themes

ironically, a forgettable and miscalculated

Andrew Bassford is a senior pursuing a
double _rnaj or in English literature and phi-
losophy. When asked to describe his style
in one word, he simply replied: “Honest.”

Bassford prides himself on being his own
inspiration when it comes to fashion. He
prefers to peruse through thrift stores
such as Goodwill rather than opting for
more popular or brand-name clothing. He
is drawn to “interesting patterns” that he
sees in South American, Native American

FASHION ON THE STREET

and Indian clothing. Winter helps Bassford
be more creative with his style choices. He
says men’s clothing is better suited for the
colder seasons becausehe prefers sweaters
and pants to shorts. He laughingly sums up
our conversation with, “Sweater weather
is better weather.” I A i

Soundsilike: Motown, baby“

It’s been nearly 26 gears since Motown:
Records was sold-zto MCA-by-its disen*i—..-’

chanted owner Berry Gordy and 42 years
since the iconic music label abandoned its
blue-collar hometown of Detroit for the
star—speckled streets of Los Angeles. In
the years since, itis been a §fouvenir ofa

major labels, such as Universal and MCA,_' D

who aremore interested in reaping the

‘ label’s royalties than producing the next L

Stevie Wonder. J
With all this in mind, it’s tempting to
writesoff‘ neo_-soul group Sharon Jones

and the Dap-K'ing’s curiously titled new _

albufn, Give the People What They Want,

as a bit of nostalgic ﬂuff more at home i
in a bygone era when theworld of music

 

revolved around the latest 7-inch pressing
from Gladys Knight and the Pips or The
Jackson 5, (instead of a pirated version
of Kanye West’s newest opus discovered
days before it’s set to be released). V

- But Jones and her brilliant backing

band aren’t offering listeners a retread J
V of the old'Motown tunes. Instead, they"re-
’ looking to give us a revival of the Motown ’
spirit. Though the effort -is tiresome at ‘
’ times,Jones and company remind us‘ that,

of the reasonslwe turn to musi¢ajre- still

A not so attracted to ‘porters, seeing them as

weaker versions of stouts and more suscep-
tible to being mined by the addition of sickly
sweet vanilla ﬂavoring (I’m looking at you,
Leinenkugel). Still, as this particular offering

was once considered the best smoked p'orter
"in the world by the_venerable Beeradvocate.

com, I ﬁgured a taste was in order. Happily,
the beer lived up to its accolades with a big,
chocolatey ﬂavor accented by a heavy dose
of hickory smoke. l'~‘or any lover of dark beer,
this is a must—have. - .
The surprise of the day came in the form
ofEast End’s Chocolate Covered Cherry Stout.

’Normally when a beer advertises cherry as

an additional ﬂavor component, it is a clear

sign to run. Most cherry-ﬂavored beers taste '

more like cough syrup than cherry, so natu-
rally, I had my doubts. But like all of East End’s
beers, this one was a success. The cherry ﬂa-

chocolate mixed into the batch. The resultwas

ﬁ‘uit to keep its drinker interested.

While a trip over to East End is always a
worthwhile adventure, Festival of Darkness
exposed visitors to something more than a
simple tasting. Itwas achance forthe brewery
to show skeptics that a ﬁm, experimental ap-
proach to beer pays off deliciously. I

MONUMENTS ,

undone many times over by a plethora of
bafflingly poor ﬁlmmaking decisions.

The most obvious ﬂaw is the lack of a con-
sistent tone. “The Monuments Men” has been
marketed as a historical caper of sorts —-— the
presence of Clooney and Damon, who previ-
ously teamed up for “Ocean’s Eleven,” only
adds to this. But the ﬁlm —‘grappling with
jarringly serious and upbeat elements — awk-
wardly oscillates between dramatic historical
account and lightheartedwar comedy. It takes
about a half-hour to realize that this ﬁlm has
no idea what it wants to be. A

Alongwitha cleartone, anarrative rhythm
is also entirely absent. Theﬁlmﬂounders and
stumbles through each scene, some of which
lack any purpose at all — early on Murray
and Balaban’s characters enjoy smokingwith
a lone and frightened German soldier in an
uncomfortably long and unﬁmny scene. And
with a script stuck in inertia, fractured even
further by multiple storylines — most of
which are fairly uneventful —- experienced
editor Stephen Mirrione couldn’t save the

HOFBRAUHAUS as

slightest bit of coherence.

Even more disappointingly, the impressive
cast is caught in the whirlwind of clumsy ﬁlm-
making, and not one talented actor is able to
transcend the ineptitude happening behind
the camera. The divided storyline hinders not
only the ﬁlm’s narrative pulse, but also the
ability of its characters to seem_like human
beings instead" of plot devices.

Additionally, “The Monuments Men” has
a generic look and feel, thanks to irritatingly
stale production value and lousy cinematog-
raphy void of creativity. Seemingly designed
to be unremarkable, the ﬁlm is a crushingly
disappointing waste of talent and a promis-
ing story idea. . L -. _ ‘ ~ '

For all of its ﬂaws, “The Monuments Men”

' does have its moments ,— Murray’s character

receives a touching Vinyl message from his
grandchildren, and the climax is far more
exciting than any other part of the ﬁlm. But
these instances are too few to be considered
saving graces. '

Delivering neither thrills nor laughs nor
historical lessons free of Clooney’s obliga-
tory speeches on the value ofhuman achieve-
ments, “The Monuments Men” is a stunning
example of human failure. JI

JONES

greets a cocky suitor with a barrage of
sonic warning shots.

“Stepback boy, "because you can’t ﬁx
crazy./ Raise your white ﬂag high because
I’m coming in blazing,” she belts out,
her just-slightly-gravelly voice bristling
with conﬁdence. She’s simultaneously
intimidating and sexy. If — as Pat Benatar
famously asserted —"— love is a battleﬁeld,
Jones is an -accomplished veteran with

scars on her heart and medals pinned to ‘

her uniform. _

Yet on the album’s last track, “S1ow
Down, Love,” she carries that same self-
assurance without giving up an ounce
of sentimentality. As the guitar’s softly
strummed chords playiatop an under-
stated horn section and gently swirling
bass- line, she softly tells a lover: “Slow
down love, and come closer. The time
has come for you to hush.”

Jones’ refreshing conviction saves
much of the album from out—and-out
mediocrity, but even her vocal swagger

can’t save the middle of the record from
lapsing into monotony. The middle of
the album’s tempo is so uniform that,
although each track stands up perfectly
well on its own, they tend to blend to-
gether, dulling the emotional edge each

' SOI'lg can carry.

It’s a contradict_ory—and somewhat
frustrating experience. The album’s
aforementioned standouts prove that
the Dap—Kings’ band leader (as well as
producer and. Daptone Records label
owner) Bosco'Mann is fully capable of
orchestrating powerful, original music
in a genre that was abandoned decades
ago. To structure the album in such a ho-
mogenous fashion almost feels lazy — as

‘ though Mann felt that the songs were so

good on theircown that their placement
Wouldn’t matter.

Still, Give the People, What They Want
is a collection of-inspired tracks and proof
that no matter how many touchscreen
devices we own, a sexy bass line still hits
home. Between Mann’s songwriting and
Jones’ charisma‘, the band reminds us that
we still want that Motown sound, even if
we didn’t realize it. I

right, crossed back to his left to shake
Patterson off the dribble and pulled up
for ajump shot that brought Syracuse
within one. _

“We were up ‘six, obviously, but
the two possessions where we didn’t

score, they obviously got the ball im— _

mediately after that and hit a basket,”
Dixon said. “And then obviously the

Ennis then took over, making two
free throws and the half-court shot
that 'will go down in infamy among
