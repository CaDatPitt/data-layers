ODK To Increase
Grade Standards
For Membership

 

'- Former 1.0 Quality Point Rating ‘

Revised To Meet National
Ruling, Connolly Says

 

“Effective at fall tapping this year,"
says Russell Connolly, C36, president
of ODK, “junior and senior men will
need a quality point average of al-
most 1.4 to be eligible for member-

-ship in the fraternity.” ’

“A new national ruling of Omicron
Delta Kappa,” Connolly said yester-
day, “makes it necessary for us to re-
vise our election requirements up-
ward. The former minimum of 1.0,
which meant a “C” average for the
candidate’s period in school, is there-
fore insuﬂicient.”

Adopted at the last national con-

'vention of the honorary all-activities
group, the new regulation sets a
scholastic standard of the University’s
all-men’s quality point average. AC-
cording to a preliminary survey of
the registrar, the all-men’s average
during the second semester last year
was 1.445. Addition of the ﬁrst
semester’s total is expected to lower

, the, requirements.

Proponents of the change arglleli
that the‘ fraternity, tapping as it does

leaders in campus activities, should‘

recognize in its tappees a higher
scholarship record. It was argued
that such a policy would encourage
better curricular work among activi-
ties heads.

Opposers to the idea stated that the
aim of ODK is to recognize leaders in
activities, not necessarily men out-
standing in scholarship. They argued
further that many worthwhile candi-
dates would be excluded by more
stringent regulations.

A survey conducted by ODK mem-
bers last May showed that the present
active group has a quality point aver-
age of 1.9.

*SchuIt;Appointed
Soph Hop Leader

Chairman Is -First ‘Non-Fraternity
Man Picked In Recent Years

D. C. Schultz, BA, has been named
chairman of the annual Sophomore
Hop.

Schultz, a graduate of Mt. Lebanon

-High School, was selected late Wed-
nesday afternoon after the Executive
Committee of the Student Faculty As-
sociation interviewed four candidates
suggested by the SFA Appointments
Committee.

The other candidates who survived
the ﬁrst eliminations Tuesday after-
noon are: Lucy Conn, C, Thomas
Howard, C, and Julian Ruslander,
BA. A committee headed by Charles
Allcroft, C36, had recommended them
from approximately 25 petitioners.

The Soph Hop, traditionally formal,
i-s usually an elaborate affair featur-
ing a nationally known orchestra. It
is scheduled for Friday, November 8.

Last year Ferde Grofe’s orchestra
played for the affair at the \Villiam
Penn Hotel.

The Executive Committee, which
makes ﬁnal selection of chairmen for
all major University undergraduate
functions, consists of William Harvey,
C36, SFA president; Dr. Vincent W.
Lanfear, dean of men; Miss Thyrsa
W. Amos, dean of women; Theodore
‘W. Biddle, assistant dean of men;
Jlunes Nicholas, E36, SFA vice presi-

’ dent; Roberta Nern, Ed36, treasurer;
Lois Follansbee, Ed37; Charles Ebert,
C36, and Dale Van Ormer, E36.

As far as can be determined,
Schultz is the first 11on-fraternity
man in recent University history to
be made chairman of the Hop. Ellis
H. Tumpson, BA36, it is thought, was
the ﬁrst non-Greek student in past

-years to chairman any major affair,
having headed the committee of the
Spring Festival Dance last spring.

The Student Faculty Association
was conceived here two years ago to
replace what was called a “decadent"
Student Council whose impartiality in
the awarding of dance chairmauships.
particularly, had been questioned.

HO ANNOUNCES THE raising

of scholastic requirements for

Discovery Of ‘Old King.Coel’s’ Island
Doesn’t Surprise Dr. Amundson At All

 

By Ethel Shrom
The story of the discovery of ‘the

I ancient city of old King Coel which

was broadcast to the world by Lowell
Thomas in his radio news report of
last Tuesday, came as no surprise to
Dr. John Amnndson, instructor in his-
tory at the University. Dr. Amund-
son observed the actual work of the
Cambridge expedition which uncov-
ered the city last summer.

Coel, by the way, is the proper
form of spelling the King's name,
thus putting all Mother Goose books
out of kilter.

After ﬁnishing research work in
London, Dr. Amnndson journeyed to
Colechester where he stumbled on the
expedition in progress.

The remains were discovered he-
neath an old mound about half a mile
from the modern city of Colechester.
The city, surrounded by a wall 100
feet high. was built upon the site of
a primitive village which ﬂourished
long before the Roman occupation.

Vfith the coming of the Romans, the

legions occupied the Celtic city, but
they later moved, and laid out their
city of Camulodunum. The ol.der
city was left to fall in ruins and to
be buried under a mound of earth
and rubbish until the recent discov-
ery again made known its location.
Its fame, however, has not died, for
children throughout the generations
have sung the praises of Old King
Coel.

Colechester also shows traces of
the Roman occupa.tion, for the street
plan still follows the pattern laid out
by the Roman engineers. The Ro-
mans excelled in the art of brick-mak-
ing. The bricks of many of their
buildings were used once again by the
Normans to build the castle which
still stands.

l The Cambridge expedition has
{brought to light many hitherto un-
 lznown facts of the civilization of that
s time. It has ﬁlled up the gaps of his-
itory between the time of Caesar and
;the coming of Claudius to the British

ilslcs, according‘ to Dr. Amnndson,

Hill Answers Question Volley

At Forum On

African Crisis

 

Urban League Secretary Defends Customs Of Ethiopia,
' Scores Italian Views, Discusses League Action

 

By James R.

Donoghue

An undercurrent of strong anti—Italian sentiment marked’ the second
meeting of Inquiry Forum Wednesday, before which William E. Hill, indus-
trial secretary of the Pittsburgh Urban League, presented “The Ethiopian

View of the Present War Crisis.”

At the beginning of his talk Mr.
the subject, stating that
And probably for that reason
Forum lacked the penetrating ques-
tioning that characterized last week’s
session, when the audience caught
Dr. Giacomo Brunetti, head of the
Italian department of the Mellon Na-
tional Bank, up on any possible dis-
‘-utable point—and there were many.

Italy’s arguments for her present
course of action in Africa were dis-
cussed by Mr. Hill early in his ta.lk.
He admitted that Ethiopia had a cer-
tain amount of slavery within its
borders, but contended that Haile
Selassie was doing his best to clear
up the situation as he had promised
the League of Nations.

“VVhy does Italy claim that Ethi-
opia is not a state when she was the
one that proposed the admission of
Ethiopia to the League of Nations?”
he asked. He paused and let the
question- provide the answer. - 5

From this point he proceeded to a
discussion of Italy’s claim that she
was cheated out of her share of the
World War spoils. “Why should
Ethiopia be penalized because Italy.
did not get her share?” he asked.

The present trouble, he stated, is
more of a war between Italy and Eng-
land than between Italy and Ethiopia.

The Forum was turned over to
nuestions by the audience after Mr.
Hill had spoken for about ten min-
utes.

“Italy Claimed Sovereignity”

"Is Italy pushing the war to divert
attention from internal industrial
uifﬁculties?” was the ﬁrst question.

"The war arises out of imperalistic
motives,” Mr. Hill answered. “ -. . .
Italy ca.nnot make capitalistic econ-
omy work.” '

The next question referred to a
charge made by Dr. Bruuetti last
week. “Has Ethiopia refused Italy

‘phVsi(?a.l~ possession‘ «of concessions‘-?”‘

“Italy claimed sovereignty over the
concessions. She has not been hon-
est with her dealings with Ethiopia
and her motives are suspect.”

“Is Ethiopia rich in natural
sources?"

“There are rumors to that effect.
but no accurate survey has been
made.” "

“Has Italy made a survey?”

“I don’t know.”

“Is it true that Ethiopian tribesmen
have made raids into Italian terri-
tory?” .

“Yes. But natives from Italian ter-
ritory have made raids into Ethiopian
territory. This happens chieﬂy be-
cause the boundaries are not clearly
deﬁned. The League has ruled, how-
ever, that neither Italy nor Ethiopia
is responsible for these raids.”

From this point the questions
veered to the actual state of affairs.
“Can Ethiopia successfully resist
ltaly?” a student asked.

“Not on the border,” Mr. Hill re-
plied. “In the inner portions of the
country it can offer strong resistance
as it is beginning to do—that is, if we
can believe the news reports.”

"Can Ethiopia resist Italy for more
than a year?”

“Yes, I think it can with the help
of ‘nature.’ ”

“Germany Would Sit Tight”

“Are England and France backing
up Ethiopia with military supplies?”

“I don’t know. There is no way
to prove it.”

The impending sanctions expected
to be made by the League were in-
troduced into the Forum. “Do you
think Italy would feel economic sanc-
tions made by the League?” ran the
first question.

“Yes,” answered the speaker.

“Do you think closing the Suez
Canal would mean war involving Eu-
rope?"

HI do.”

What Germany intends to do in
case of a war involving European
countries was the drift of the next

re-

question.
“Germany would probably sit
tight,” M,r. Hill replied. “Later she

would ally herself with whichever
side proved of greatest advantage to
her interests.”

A coed, sympathetic toward Italy’s
economic
prorblemsyasked how the world could
help solve those problems.

The speaker suggested internation-
al control of raw materials.

“But it would take ﬁve years at
least to get such control working,”
obit-cterl a realist in the audience.
The point was admitted without much
argument.

“Does I-Jngland want Ethiopia?”

“I don’t think so. England is pri-
marily interested in. the Ethiopian
situation because she feels that
Italian control of the country might

[Panthers To Meet
Formidable Foes
In Mountaineers

West Virginia Outﬁt Anticipates
First Victory In Seven Years;
McNish At End For Pitt

With claws well sharpened, Coach
Jock Sutherland’s Pitt Panthers were
set to face the barrage of pigskin
buckshot that the Mountaineelﬂs from
West Virginia are expected ‘to un-
leash in the annual .grid.st-ru-ggle be-
tween the two. teams, tomorrow after-

noon at the Stadium. Both elevens
will be making their third start of

the season.

Pitt will be seeking its third
straight victory while the Mountain-
eers would like to chalk up their sec-
ond win having been held to a score-
less tie in the opening encounter by
the West Virginia Wesleyan Bobcats.

Coach Tallman’s boys have been
pointing for this game and, accord-

’ing to the reports from Pitt scouts

who saw the Mountaineers in action

last Saturday, the Panthers will have
their hands full tomorrow afternoon.

West Virginia has not won a foot-
ball game from Pitt since 1928, when
the Mountaineers surprised the Pitt
boys with a 9-6 triumph. Last year
the Blue and Gold representatives
won a hard-fought 27-6 victory over
the Hilltoppers down at Morgantown.

Both teams will start their strong-
est lineups, although the Panther
forces were weakened by the loss of
Frank Souchak, who was injured dur-
ing one of the practice sessions this
week. In his place Coach Sutherlan-.1
plans to use Bernie McNish, a junior
‘with very little varsity ‘experience.’

McNish got into the Wash-Jeff
struggle for about ten minutes last
Saturday which, incidentally, tells the
extent of his experience as a varsity
competitor.

At the other end Vin Sites, who was
acting captain last week, will start.
Ave Daniell and Art Detzel will likely
hold down the left and right tackle
berths, respectively. The center trio
will include Biff Glassford at left
guard, Nick Kliskey at center, and
Dante Dalle Tezze at right guard.

Coach Sutherland will probably
rely on the same quartet of backs that
started last-week. Johnny Michelosen
will handle the quarterback and punt-
ing duties, Bob LaRue and Hub Ran-
dour will start at the halfback posts,

Seibel To Sp¢:alz
To Interculturals

Next Wednesday

George Seibel, noted literary and
dramatic critic, will address Inter-
Cultural Associates in the ﬁrst of a
series of evening meetings on Wed-
nesday, October 16, in Room 1309,
Cathedral, at 8 o’clock. He will dis-
cuss “Personality and National Cul-
tures.”

Seibel, aside from his regular con-
tributions to a Pittsburgh daily,
speaks weekly over a local station in
an informal manner on "The World
of Books.” In December of 1934 he
completed his 400th broadcast, one
of the longest features on the radio.

Though Seibel never entered an in-
stitution of higher learning as a stu-
dent, he is a master of German and
French, knows Italian and Spanish,
and has a library that includes over
10,000 volumes——one of the largest
private collections in the United
States. He has lectured in England
and Germany,-and he has written sev-
eral plays and books.

The German Club of the University
has been extended a formal invita-
lion to attend the meeting. All stu-
dents interested are invited. Ann
Fell, C36, program chairman, has ar-
ranged for refreshments.

Debate Tryouts Continue
For Remaining Openings

The Men’s Debating Association
still has openings on its squad for
students of the University, according
to Dr. W. M. Parrish. professor of
public speaking and rlirector of the
debaters.

Tryouts will be held Monday at 2:30
o'clock and Wednesday at 12:30
o’clock in Room 308, Alumni Hall.

tion, business manager of the 1936

Owl, who has been named cadet—col-
onel of the University ROTC corps.

Bowman, Weber,
Trustees Praise
S Band In Audition-

Before an audience of Chancellor
John G. Bowman, Mr. John Weber,
business (manager of the University,
and members of the board of trustees
Tuesday evening, the University Band,
under the direction of Lee M. Lock-
hart, received the commendation of
all attending.

"This year the band shows unusual
promise. The optional pre-school
drill period, according to Mr. Lock-
hart, accounts for the ﬁne perform-
ance of the organization at the Wash-
ington and Jefferson game last Sat-
urday. The band went through its
spelling lesson in rare form. '

Among the band ensembles being
organized this year is the saxophone
quartet which introduced itself last
Tuesday night. The unit is composed
of William Johnson, Ed36, Charles
Smith, C38, Herbert Cohen, BA38, and
John Cheffey, C38. A trombone quar-
tet has also been formed with the fol-
lowing members: George Gehres,
C35, James Earhart, BA36, John Shir-
ley, BA37 and Robert Matzen, Ed36.
Other ensemble units will be organ-
ized within the next few weeks.

Mr. Lockhart wishes to announce
the last ca.ll for members of the fresh-
man beginner's band. Those inter-
ested who have had no previous ex-
perience are eligible.

Following the Waynesburg game
two weeks ago, the band played sev-
eral numbers before the Children's
Hospital. Soon afterwards a letter
was received from the Hospital
thanking the band for the entertain-
ment. The musicians will pay a re-
turn visit tomorrow following the
game at the Stadium.

afternoon. Frank Engel, C38, will
preside at the meeting, acting with
the executive committee on the ritual
1 roceedings.

Reports will be made by the na-
tional convention and smoker commit-
tees in addition to the regular treas-
urer and social reports. Letters have
been sent out to the seven universi-
ties holding Druid charters in 11.11 at-
tempt to call a national convention
here in Pittsburgh during the current

University Plans
Freshman Award

 

Customs Observance, Scholarship
To Be Standards Ofiudging

As a further incentive to freshmen
to observe freshman customs, the Uni-
versity will present between 30 and
40 percent of the highest standing
freshmen with shields, symbolic of
outstanding achievement during the
freshman orientation program.

The shields will be about one foot
square, with the University seal in
the center, and will also contain a
Latin quotation inscribed above the

seaL

To qualify for this plaque, freshmen
will be rated according to scholarship,
cbservance of customs, and the rec-
ommendation of upperclass counsel-
ors.

In addition to this honor, accordinzz,
to Charles Herald, C36, chairman of
the SFA customs committee, fresh-
men will be examined on their knowl-
edge of the University’s history,
school songs and cheers, how much
they read the campus publications,
and their knowledge of the names of
administrative oflicials and campus
leaders.

The examinations, Herald explained,
will be given by upperclass counsel-
ors at the regular meetings of the col-
lege orientation classes on Tuesday
and Thursday. , __ .-..-/*4

Upon the successful completion of
this examination, freshmen will be
given a second pin, to replace the
green buttons, which were distributed
at the beginning of the school year.
Herald also requests all freshmen to
wear their green buttons at all times,
to show their cooperation with the
University in orieutating them to
Pitt, its customs, and its traditions..

Herald further added that wearing
of the green button is necessary to
qualify for the plaques to be dis-
tributed later in the semester.

Rushing Period Ends Sunday Morning;
‘Mum’s’ The Creek Word Next Week

 

Only two more days remain of the
hectic 10-day men’s fraternity rush-
ing period. Sunday morning at 2
o’clock, all rush-ing activity by fra
ternities will cease for a period of
nine days, extending until 5 o’clock
on the afternoon of Monday, October
21.

During this week. rushees will make
known to the office of the dean of
men their choice of a fraternity. The
fraternities will submit to that office,
before 9:30 o’clock, Monday morning,
October 14, the sealed bids, on the
prescribed forms, for the students
whom they wish invited to pledge-
ship. As rapidly as possible, the of-
ﬁce of the dean of men will then issue
these invitations to the rushees.

During this period from October
13 to October 21, known as the “si-
lence” or “bidding” period, no “mem-
ber or members, pledge or pledges, of
a. fraternity shall approach, talk to,
or communicate by direct or indirect
means with any newly-registered stu-
dents.” (Quoted from the lnterl‘ra-

ternity Council rushing rules).

The office of the dean of men will,
at the conclusion of the silence
period, transmit to the fraternities
the acceptances andadeclinations re-
ceived from their rushees.

-Coincident with the close of the
bidding period at 5 o’clock on Monday
afternoon, October 21, the fraterni-
ties shall not pledge or issue invita-
tions to pledge to any newly-registered
students for a period of one month.
This rule interpreted by Mr. N. Rob-
ert Seidle, assistant to the dean of
men in charge of fraternities, as pre-
pared by the Interfraternity Council,
means that a student who has not
been pledged during the 1'egular
pledging period, may not be pledged
until a month has elapsed. This period
extends to 9 o’clock, Thursday morn-
ing, November 21. Newly-registered
students. however, may be enter-
tained during this month period. The
fraternities will follow the regular
procedure of submitting bids on the

deﬁnite forms in pledgiiig these s*g- ._

dents.

Five Minutes For Alma Mater

OMETIME, PERHAPS many years ago, soine-

 one instituted the idea that University stu-

dents sliould remain at their seats following

the ﬁnal whistle of a football game and sing

“Alma Mater” while the band played. It is likely

a good idea to point out to students that this same
bit of ceremony is still being used.

All spectators at football games may be divided
roughly into three classes: those who go to the
game only to have the fun of leaving early while
-everyone else is watching, those who make tracks
for the exits and the street cars at the moment
the ﬁnal gun sounds, a.nd those who haven’t a
thing else in the world to do but hang around for
‘five minutes and sing a song.

It has always seemed rather unnecessary for stu-
dents to go racing down to the street cars or to
hotfoot it over to an automobile when the min-
utes they attempt to save will be lost again while
the traffic entanglement is cleared. \

If each person in those cheering sections could
lend the cheerleaders not only a hand, but a good,
strong voice as well, there would be a great deal
more of concerted noise coming from those sec-

Try To Beat The Band

' AYS BEFORE SCHOOL STARTED this fall,
" a. bunch of fellows were tooting and blowing

for many hours in a seventh ﬂoor room of
the Cathedral. 'l‘he University h.ad authorized an
early band practice and drill, and the boys were
‘hard at work. On one occasion the unit was heard
to repeat one short strain of a selection for an
hour before it was played to the satisfaction of the
directors. . ,

This intense effort and training has shown splen-
did results. Director Lee M. Lockhart appears to
have put a new and different sort of pep into the
organization. Captain Donald Tredeiinick has
kept the marching activities of the unit at the
usual top notch.

The University may well be proud of its band,
‘this year more than any other. The band incin-
bers may certainly feel that they ’ve begun a good
job. ' The fact that they must constantly improve
need hardly be pointed out to them. After all,
we’re expecting them to give the Army boys a

-marching lesson early in November.

The work well started must be kept up. It is

"hoped that each successful “boom” may not prove

‘a ‘boomerang.

Some Trio!

Of all things: Bill Fox, Bea Abbiss, and “Ape” Ro-
derick comprising an inseparable trio . . which one is
the stand in? Incidentally, why didn't Roderick trundle
around to the recent CA dance . . or was Bea there
with somebody else? . . Who was the guy that said
to Ruthie Mills, "Oh, so you ﬁnally got to a Delt rush-

it happen up in Youngstown? .

The Old Army Game .

Real fraternalism: Harry Pinsky, SAM, sidles up
to a brother and moans, “Fellow, I haven't eaten for
two weeks. How about lending me a couple of

bucks?" The brother kicked in and Harry put the
dough on the Cubs. . .1 now both of them are. starv-

By Jean Barnes

The Allegheny Observatory is hav-
ing a good year. It has just received
a coat of paint, a dome and metal
trimmings, and now its director, Dr.
Frank Craig Jordan, who is also pro-
fessor of astronomy at the University,
has written an article for the Natural
History Magazine for October.

Its name is “Infant Class in As-
troiiomy."

The theme is the mistakes made in
astronomical allusions in literary
documents.

But these days are not the only
good ones the Observatory has seen.
Back in 1867, when itwas just found-
ed and stood on Perrysville Avenue,
S. P. Langley was its director. In
those days aerodynamics was the
moot question. and Langley was a
scientist who rated “tops.”

Very few people know it, but Lang-
ley was the man who really invented
the airplane. The VVright brothers
did not do it, they simply developed
the idea.

In 1887 Langley left the Observa-
tory for the Smithsonian Institute at
Washington.

Then, in 1904, the old place took
on new life in a new place, in River-
view Park where it is today. In 1914
it got the Thaw refractor telescope,
the best photographic refractor iii the
world. The telescope has a 30-inch
lens, with a focal length of 555 inches.
Since that time, 53,000 plates have
been made with it.

VVitli the aid of this instrument,
star distances and more accurate
ones have been found than in any
other observatory in the world.

The plates from this telescope are
used for photometry, the light curves
of variable stars. This study will
aid in solving some of the puzzles of
the universe and its structure, but
it still hasn't solved the one of how
to go to a College Association dance
on half a dollar.

Since the new refractor telescope
has been put in, the old 30-inch re-

endanger the Lake Tsaiia project for
Nile valley irrigation.”

Concerning the proposal of certain
nations to cede territory in Africa to
Italy. a student wanted to know who
should cede what.

“Those countries which have the
most territory,” answered Mr. Hill.

Japan was brought into the picture.
“Do you think Japan would take a
chance in Mancliuria if a general war
should result?”

Mr. Hill admitted that there was
such danger. “That’s why the U. S.
prefers to remain neutral,” he added.

During a lull in the questions, Mr.
Hill commented on the supposed
penchant of Ethiopians for eating raw
meat. He explained that many years
ago when the Mohainmedaiis were in-
vading the country, the Ethiopian
soldiers didn't want to light ﬁres on
the battleﬁeld for fear they might give
away their position to the enemy.

Tliafnight they ate raw meat. Since
then this action has been made into
a ceremonial much like the aiiiiual
celebration of the Fascist march on
Rome. ,

“When I was a student, Mr. Hill
contiiiued, “I waited on the table in
the school cafeteria. One day an
Italian gentleman came in and or-
dered steak, which he wanted cooked
according to the directions he gave.
it. was the rawest piece of meat I
ever served. The geiitlemairs name
was Enrico Caruso.”

“Is the Negro press of America
spreading pi-opaganda‘?” was the ques-
tion that brought the forum back to
serious business.

“Yes. It is decidedly pro-Ethio-
pian.”

Mr. Hill feels that Italy would be
wise in submitting to the League of
Nations because it "will eventually
‘ﬁnd that the costs of the war will
be prohibitive. Besides, he thinks
that Italy is morally wrong, for she
is duty bound as a signer of the tri-
partite treaty of 1906 to keep hands
off Ethiopia.

Larkin Speaks Today

F. L. Larkin, head of the depart-
ment of mechanical engineering at
Lehigh University and chairman of
the student relations committee of the
American Society of Mechanical En-
gineers, will address juniors and
seniors of the School of Engineering
at 2 o'clock today in Room 1409,

Tickets For Smoker,
Dance On Sale Today

Tickets for the Engineeriiig Associa-
tion Dance will appear on the campus
this afternoon. These tickets, costing
one dollar, can be used not only for
the dance_ November 15, but for the
Smoker which is to be held on Janu-
ary 9.

The plan was decided upon at a
cabinet meeting on Vvediiesday which
12 members attended. The orcliestra
will probably be a well known local
band. As yet, the pla.ce has not been
deﬁnitely decided upon, and Iﬂdward
Slieplierd, IE86, is interested in sug-
gestions from engineeriiig students.

ﬂector telescope has been collecting
dust and ﬁnger-marks.‘ -The—~platform
on which the Thaw telescope is
mounted is too small for both iiistru-
ments. This telescope was used for
spectrographic work before the Thaw
refractor was installed.

A 13-inch refractor which Dr. Lang-
ley used for his sun work and which
Keeler, his successor also used, is
now in the small visitor's dome.

This work of measuring star dis-
tances, known to the initiated as
stellar parallax, and the photometric
work are carried on every clear night
of the year. This work ﬁnds practi-
cal outlets in three ﬁelds. It meas-
ures exact time, it aids in navigation,
and it is used in large scale survey,
such as surveying the boundaries of

The Mountaineers will probably
line up with Herb Barua. and Angelo
Onder at ends; Joe Stydahar and
Sam Mawhinney at tackles; Dave
Volkin and Carl Hall at guards; and
Oley Hedrick at center.

In the backﬁeld Coach Tallman will
probably start Bob Kyle at quarter,
Carder and Gocke at halves, and Joe
Zaleski at fullback. Kelly Moan,
brilliant sophomore back, may get the

starting assignment in place of
Gocke.
Scouts who saw M,oan in action

last week were impressed by his for- 
Long .

ward passing ability. The
Beach, California boy hit the mark
ﬁve out of-seven times last Saturday.
The only reason that he did not con-
nect the other two times being that
Joe Stydahar dropped a couple of
perfect throws.

Stydahar, although he plays a tackle
position, ﬁgures prominently in the
Mountaineer passing offense. On
some shift plays, Big Joe moves to an
end post where he is eligible to re-
ceive aerial ﬁings. , ,

Tomorrow's game will be the Pan-
thers’ last “test game” before they
meet the Ramblers from South Bend.

West Virginia is by" far the heaviest
and most formidable outﬁt that the
Panthers have stacked I up against
this season. «  " '

Carlson, Davies,

Sutherland ‘OK’
All- Time Choices

Three famous ex-Panther football
stars, “Jock” Sutherland and “«Red”
Carlson, both ’17, and “Tommy” Davies,
’21, appeared to have this business of
circumlocution well in hand when in-
terviewed for comments on tl.e all-
time Pitt elevens selected by George
Trevor, New York Sun sports writer.

Carlson’s statements were conﬁned
to “Fine, ﬁne——very good selections."
Why should he point out that De Hart
and Hastings, both backs on the
nythical second team lineup, never
made a tackle in 1916. That De Hart
couldn't toss a pass. “And then too,”
he added, “all Caruso could do -was
sing!” Gibby VVelch was really the
finest halfback in his opinion.

Dr, Sutherland went his coaching
colleague one better in handling this
business. Declining to comment
publicly on the all-time issue, he
pointed to a ﬁner classiﬁcation for
football “greats.”

“Because his physical make-up of
200-pounds adapted him for play at
the tackle position much better than
a lighter man, shades of “greatness”
Is _a 200-
pound boy at tackle as “great” as the
boys under this mark?” he queried.

Tommy Davies, present freshman
mentor at Tech, considered “Skip”
Gougler a great blocker. He also liked
the play of Andy Gustafson, fullback,
and Lloyd Jordan, end.

Bob lVTadden Advances
In Tennis Tournment

Bob Madden, Panther net ace, de-
feated Frank Williams, Universit_y of
Virginia star, 6-2, 6-4, to gain the
fourth round in the seventh annual
Middle Atlantic States Intercollegiate
tennis tournament now in progress at
VVhite Sulphur Springs, West Vir-
ginia.

After playing a hard and fast brand
of tennis in the ﬁrst two sets, Ralph
Bald, the other Pitt contestant, tired
in the third set and was eliminated by
H. Newman, Elizabethtown College
net star, 6-1, 3-6, 6-2.

Brilliant play carried Bald and
Madden through two triumphs in the
doubles matches to enter the ﬁnal
round. They defeated the University
of Virginia’s doubles team 6-2, 6-3,
and Penn State’s doubles combina-
tion, 8-6. 6-0.

Madden had little trouble in beat-
ing Vvilliam VVest, Lynchburg College
6-0, 6-2, to reach the quarter ﬁnals in
the Greenbriar Autumn tourney.

The Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate
matches are being played in the morn-
ing, while the Greenbriar Autumn In-
vitation event is held in the afternoon.

 

Quarantillo Quits Panthers
To Accept Business Offer

_:_—

Eddie Quarantillo, Panther right
end, has withdrawn from the Univer-
sity, it was announced Wednesday
afternoon by Pitt a.t......:l'.lC authorities.

Quarantillo, a varsity letterman,
who was counted upon for heavy duty
this year__ missed several practices last
week. Upon his return to drills this
week, he stated as a reason for his
absence that he had )na.1'l1ULL, thereby
making himself ineligible for further
athletic competition at the University.
This policy was adopted last year by
athletic authorities.

Pitt Band To Greet Novicesi
In Annual Fall Track Meet

 

Pitt’s 125-piece band will open the
ceremonies at the Fourth Annual Uni-
versity Track and Field Carnival, Oc-
tober 16-17.

Novice runners at this time dig- at
their marks to inaugurate this year’s
track season here at the University.

The pole vault, running broad jump,
high jump, and all other track events
will be run off in the S-tadium on the
opening day, I/Vednesday, October 16.

The hammer, javelin, discus throw,
and 12-pound shot events _ will take
on ’lnursday, October 17. Coach Carl
Olson expects even _greater perf_orn=.-
ances than those of last year. To sub-
stantiate this, he reports that approx-
imately 75 men will compete in the 12-
event program.

Candidates are hard at work in
their daily workouts at the Sta_dium,
preparing for their respective events.
Since the meet is being conducted for
the purpose of uncovering track mate-
rial, every boy, regardless of previous
experience is urged to compete.

“There is a place for every boy,
large or small,” Coach Olson said. Let-
ter and numeral winners in track or
cross-country are barred, to give the
inexperienced t-rackmen a fair chance.

Officials for the meet, composed of
faculty and varsity members, are as
follows: James Hagan, director of the
meet; John VVeber and Don Harrison,
honorary referees; Dr. J. B. Suther-

Olson To Enter Entire Yearling
Squad In Intramural Event

The ﬁrst Panther Run, will not be
all Greek since track Coach Carl 0}-

son has announced that the entire '

freshman cross-cou~ntry squad, with
the exception of Johnny Woodruff,
will be very much in the running dur-
ing the novice climb at 4 o’clock, to-
day.

In fact, the conditioned Greenies
aim to push the Interfrat lads far in
arrears at the ﬁnish. Unaffiliated en-
tries loom up only in the question
mark column.

Indications at the beginning of the
week pointed towards Greek dom-
inance. This was especially noticea-
ble when the meet offered competition
among the Greek houses for a team
trophy.

The Run starts promptly at 4 o'clock
near the taxi-stand on the Cathedral
corner of Fifth Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard. Thysical education ma-
jors will clock the hill-climbers at the
ﬁnish on the Alumni Hall ramp. The
entire course covers’ approximately
one mile. I

Martin .T. Feely, director of Intra-
mural athletics, estimates that at
least 45 novices will be in the running
for the three individual awards to go
to the ﬁrst three ﬁnishers. Interest is
high in the Greek title-ﬁght due pri-
marily to the competitive rushing pe-
riod now nearing a ﬁnale on the cam-
pus.

“A majority of the 13 social houses
will be out to break into the head-
lines on the sport page, Friday,”
Feeley maintains. “It should be a real
scrap from start to ﬁnish,” he con-
eludes.

Touch Football competition in both
Intramural and Greek divisions opens
Tuesday, one day later than originally
scheduled.

Team entries have been coming in
slowly for the football competition.
They should be sent in immediately to
either Room 801, Cathedral, or the
Trees Gymnasium office.

scorers; Dr. John J. Geise, Dr. Francis
D. Tyson, Dr. S. C. Crawford, and Dr.
V. C. Wright, timers.

Head of the judges at the ﬁnish line
will be John Dambach, who will be
aided by Dr. Omar C. Held, E. S. Os-
berg, T. Corbett, Don Saunders, and
Sergeant A. A. Gunter. Head of the
field judges will be Charles Gongloff,
present holder of the National Inter-
Collegiate javelin record.

Field judges in the various events
are as follows; Dr. S. P. Franklin, Dr.
George Gould, William Follansbee,
and Dr. John A. Nietz, high jump; Dr,

James H. Potts will be the starter
and T. A. Seidle, clerk of the course,
will be assisted by Fred Kiger.

honors were carried off by Irvin

in the pole vault, 220-yard dash, and

15 points to lead the ﬁeld.

Team Meets Tech

Mil1igan’s Fresh -Eleven Makes
Initial Appearance Tomorrow

Having already applied the ﬁnish-
ing touches to his freshman football
aggregation, Mike Milligan is busy to-
day priming his boys for their sea-
son's inaugural with the Carnegie
Tech Plebes at the Tartan Bowl to-
morrow morning.

At 10 o'clock, the time set for the
opening kick-off, the men who may
play leading roles in the Panther foot-
ball fortunes for the next four years
will make their ﬁrst public appear-
ance. The starting lineup will be
studded with a galaxy of high school
pigskin stars, attempting to make
their mark on the collegiate gridiron.

Word from the Highlander’s camp
indicates that the neighborly oppon-
ents boast a formidable array of
talent which is bound to make the
morning somewhat uncomfortable for
the Panther yearlings. With the lac-
ing the Panthers handed their pre-
decessors each year still fresh in
Tech memories, the Tartans will be
ﬁghting with revenge in their hearts.

Several positions in the Pitt lineup
are yet to be ﬁlled. Ben Asavitch
and Al Berger are battling it out for
the right tackle assignment, while
right end is a toss-up between Louis
Daddio and Charlie Fleming. Al-
though John Chickerneo has received
the nod for the fullbacking duties,
Chuck Shea and A1 Lezovosky are cer-
tain to see plenty of action.

Women To Train
Before Debating

Association Plans To Develop
Speech, Debate Techniques

 

Plans for two months’ training in
debate and speech techniques before
any actual debates are presented be-
fore outside audiences were formu-
lated last night by members of the
\Vomen’s Debating Association at
Heinz House in their ﬁrst meeting of
the year.

No extension debates will take place
this year before December, Miss
Theresa Kahn, coach, announced. In
the meantime, the squad will hold
weekly meetings at which socialized
medicine, the topic for the year’s ex-
tension debates, will be discussed.

The Association will further be di-
vided into two groups, one to meet
and discuss debating technique, the
other to consider problems of voice
and delivery. All members of the As-
sociation will be required to attend
the general weekly discussion meet-
ings, and may attend the sessions of
either of the other two groups. The
bulletin boards in front of Room 220,
Alumni Hall, and in the women’s de-
bating ofﬁce in Room 215 will be used
for deﬁnite announcements of the
dates of these meetings.

Thirty women attended the Associa-
tion’s meeting last night, the largest
number ever in the squad.

ance last year when it was felt that

part, be the same as last year's ex-
cept that the method of cataloging
the names will be different. This
year the names of the women will be
in alphabetical order, regardless of
class, in order to facilitate its use.

New WAA Plait
To Be Instituted

Women Belong Indirectly; Sports
Units Comprise Sub-Divisions

The VVomen's Athletic Association
is following a different course in its
annual membership drive this year.
The new feature is a club for every
sport.

Instead of joining VVAA directly,
the prospective member will enter a
seasonal sports group under the di-
r(-.cti0n of WAA, but with a manager
and an organization of its own.
These clubs will follow the seasonal
sports plan, which is the usual routine
for WAA.

The four clubs for the fall season
are: riding. hockey, SWllli1Till1g’,~8.ll'l
recreational sports. The latter, in
turn, includes tennis, archery, bad-
minton, paddle tennis, squash, ping
pong and volleyball. The fall clubs
will be under the general manager-
ship of Betty Cox, Ed37, who will an-
nounce her separate chairmen in the
Sports Side-Light on Monday.

In addition to these four there will
be an Outing Club, open to members
of any other group. Members of this
organization will go on week-end out-
ings and other excursions.

Club dues will be 25 cents a semes-
ter. Any woman desirous of joining
more than one club at a time may do
so by paying 25 cents for each one.

In addition to the managers for
each group, appointed by the fall
chairman, the members will select
their own treasurer. A portion of the
club dues collected will be turned over
to the club so that they may sponsor
their own events.

More detailed plans .will be a.n-
nounced at the ‘series of luncheons to
be given by WAA next week for the
upperclass women.

Mortar Board Plans Sale

vert old clothes into cash at their

clothes, furniture, jewels or bric—a-

brac may take them to Heinz House
before the sale.

Ruth Seitz, C36, assistant chairman,
are in charge of the sale.

The Pitt News
