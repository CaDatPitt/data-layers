Interpretations of Freshman
Test Scores Lead to Debate

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL
Pitt News Staff Writer
College of Arts and Sciences
Dean Robert Marshall, using
statistics based on the current
freshman class, argues Pitt is

admitting students who may be

unable to compete academically
here, and that the school should
take steps to help those students.

A spokesman at the admissions
ofﬁce, using statistics based on the
current freshman class, claims the
Class of ’81 is not unlike the 10
classes that preceded it; Pitt
freshmen are above the national
average determined by the Scho-
lastic Aptitude Test.

‘ ‘The enrollment trends of recent
years, ’ ’ Marshall wrote in the latest
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Gazette, “have resulted in the
admission of many students to the

College of Arts and Sciences for‘

whom successful completion of a
college program will require
considerable guidance and‘ aca-
demic help.”

Marshall has sought to bridge
what he sees as a schism between
Pitt’s admissions standards and

Pitt News Staff Writer

Howard Beck, Socialist candi-
date for mayor of Pittsburgh said,
“you would have to be out of touch
with the political reality in the
United States to think that I was
going to be elected.”

However, the 26-year-old ‘ Oak-
land resident’s candidacy has been
taken seriously enough to draw
widespread media attention, in-
cluding talk shows on KQV and
KDKA radio.

Beck, in a recent Pitt News
interview said, “I decided to run in
Pittsburgh because I have a
background in the area and I feel I
have an understanding of the
political situation in Pittsburgh.”

He sees the steel industry and
the pending referendum concern-
ing it as the main campaign issue.
The referendum states: “Should
county and municipal elected
ofﬁcials ﬁght to change federal
environmental laws in order to
preserve jobs in the steel indus-

“It’s an unfair issue,” said Beck.
“I’m urging A a ‘no’ vote. We
shouldn’t have to make a decision
between jobs and clean air. If the
corporation were forced to put
human need before proﬁt, we could
have a clean environment and jobs,
too.”

A second issue he cited is the
amount of Federal funds Pitts-
burgh receives. .“Forty cents of
every dollar of Federal income tax
is returned to the city. We should
get much more than that. Federal
money should be turned back to the
city and used for Federal public
works projects,” Beck said.

Beck, a Social Workers Party
member, said the party does not
fund his campaign, rather dona-
tions averaging between 50 dollars
and 100 dollars from working
people make up most of his funds.

Beck accused his opponents of
not being able to produce what the
people want.

“Tom Foerster is themachine
candidate, obviously. The more he
talks and the more he tries to

defend himself, the more trouble
he gets himself into.”

Originally from Hermann, Butler
County, Beck has been a city
resident since 1969. He is a
machinist at Miller Western
Printing.

“At first it was an amusement,”
Beck said of his fellow workers’
reaction to his candidacy, “that one
of us could run for ofﬁce.

“But within the last month the
serious response that I've been
getting from the media and the
different candidates has also been
reﬂected in the attitudes of the
people Iwork with, he said. “There
is a certain amount of not only
sympathy, but support for the ideas
I put forward.”

On other issues, his basic
solution for unemployment, trans-
portation and neighborhood main-
tenance rests in Washington. “The
only way you are going to upgrade
the quality of life in Pittsburgh is
by demanding Federal funding,”
Beck said.

academic expectations by introduc-
ing a program that identiﬁes and
aids such students, especially in the
area of writing.

But “standards here are not
really declining,” said Edmund
Harper, freshman admissions ofﬁ-
cer. “The class has been the same
for about 10 years.

“National SAT scores have been
declining,” he added, “but ours are
staying about where they have
been.”

Harper said the mean SAT scores
for the current freshmen are 500 on
the verbal section, 550 on the math
section and 1,050 combined.

“We’re considerably above the
national average for SAT’s,” he
said.

According‘ to Shih-Wei Lien,
assistant CAS dean, the averages
do not present a problem; the
difﬁculty occurs when the lower-
scoring students are considered.

Figures From
Dean's Article

The following is excerpted from an Oct. 15
FAS Gazette article by CAS Dean Robert
Marshall that discussed admissions and
academic policies.

Again, to deﬁne the reality of
the present, last year we
admitted 641 freshmen with
SAT Verbal scores at. 440 or
below (i.e., approximately un-
der the national average).
This year we admitted 783 such
freshmen. We admitted 3,509
of the 4,569 students who
applied. We referred 780 to the
regional campuses. ‘We
rejected only 121 of those 4,569
students.

CAS granted admission to
(not to say that all accepted)
1,153 students who scored
below the national average in
both Verbal (430’s) and Math
(470’s) SAT’s. We have a
freshman class of 1,983 (as
opposed to the 1,750 students
speciﬁed in the CASC resolu-
tion of a year ago). We continue
to have in CAS large numbers of
students each year who do not
meet the minimum require-
ments of 24 credits and a 2.0
QPA in one year (958 in
1974-75, 632 in 1975-76, 834 in
1976-77).

“We don't like to talk about
average,” Lien said. “The kind of
information you need is the range.
It is easy to be deceived by the
average; the average is good.

“But what do we do with the
students who are below the
average?”

According to Marshall, CAS this
year offered admission to more than
1,100 applicants who scored below
the national average on both SAT
sections. Disregarding athletes (for
whom academic help already is
available) and University-Com-
munity Education Program stu-
dents (who are enrolled in a
remedial program of advising and
classes), 451 new CAS students
scored below 430 on the SAT verbal
section, Marshall said.

“We believe . . . the 430 SAT
(verbal) ﬁgure does provide us with
students who need a special skills
curriculum,” Marshall said. “At
this time, the SAT scores seem to be
proving far more useful than we had
expected.”

Harper said SAT scores were one
of several factors that should be
considered by those who wish to
gauge a student's ability to tackle a
course load at Pitt. He cited ﬁgures
indicating 64 percent of this year’s,
freshmen were in the top ﬁfth of
their high school classes and that an
additional 27 percent were "in the
second ﬁfth. “That’s pretty good,”
he said. “Standards are not really
declining here.”

He said 6,100 applications were
received by the University for this
academic’ year, and that 4,436
persons were offered admission.
Some 2,475 matriculated, he said.

“It was a good year for
engineering and nursing students,
especially,” said Harper,
since there were institutions that
didn’t meet their freshman class
goal ﬁgures, I’d say we did pretty
well.”

Whatever the outcome of the
debate, which will be continued by
the CAS Council. Pitt Will 113%
beneﬁtted, Lien said.

“This type of discussion is
necessary,” he said. “In an
academic community such as Pitt,
this topic should be considered
often, but it hasn't been here. I
hope this will get people excited

Editor’s note: This is the first of
three interviews with Pittsburgh
mayoral candidates.

By JIM GEFSKY
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Republican candidate for
mayor is Joseph Cosetti, city
treasurer since 1970.

Q. What can you do as mayor to
alleviate Pitt’s budget crisis?

Cosetti: This is entirely a state
matter, and though I would like to
see this problem resolved, the
mayor is in no position to require
that the state do anything. I believe
this is caused by partisan politics
and a lack of leadership in
Harrisburg. The governor has
remained obstinate about budget
cuts, and Harrisburg has placed
Pitt in a hostage situation. I believe
the best solution lies in working
with individual legislators. I would
like to think that I could use some
sort of unofﬁcial pressure but
apparently, as shown by the
Philadelphia school crisis, the
mayor doesn’t have a lot of clout in
Harrisburg.

Q. Do you favor Pitt’s continued
physical expansion in Oakland?

C: It depends on just where that
expansion takes place. If that
expansion were to uproot resi-
dents, I would think it would be
unfair, but if it were to involve
parks or empty lots, I have no
objections.

Q: What about special problem
areas like fraternities?

C: I don’t view them as special
problems. There has always been a
problem between town and gown. I
was president of my fraternity and
of the IFC, and so I view it as more

of a generation gap. The only ‘real
solution is to put all of the Greeks
in their own special area, but until
that time, the fraternities and
neighbors are just going to have to
live with each other.

Q: Do you have any thoughts as
to how security in the Oakland-Pitt
area can be improved?

C: Ithink security in that area is
pretty good. The campus police
force is already quite large. I think
I could have the city police undergo
more training in the problems of
college-aged people. I would want
to make sure that minor things
don’t become major_ones. This can
be done only by expanding the
training in the police force far
beyond the basic training they now
Teceive.

Q: Is there any way you could
assure us of continued bus service,
so as not to repeat last winter’s bus
strike?

C: No. The buses are under the
county’s jurisdiction, and I don’t
think it’s useful or proper to tell
PAT or the county how to run their
business. If there is a speciﬁc
city-related problem, such as bus
routes in the city, then I can get
actively involved. Other than that
type of problem, I think that by
getting involved the mayor pro-
bably might complicate things.

Q: Do you favor any type of rapid
transit, or lowering of bus fares?

C: I’m not positive about
speciﬁcs or exact costs, but I think
what the city really needs is some
type of limited access system going
from Craig Street to downtown.
After all, this is where the largest
congestion of traffic is. As for-
lowering bus fares, I’m not sure it

could be done without
countywide tax supporting it.
Eventually, some type of tax might
have to help the bus system. I just
don’t feel that they can make a
proﬁt simply by the fare box.

Q: What job opportunities would
you create, so as to encourage Pitt
graduates to remain in Pittsburgh?

C: In the public sector, I’d like to
create more middle management
jobs; I think in that area, GSPIA
could be extremely useful. The
private sector also is limited but
with the colleges providing a
supply of trained labor, I would
encourage new private industry to
locate in Pittsburgh and tap it,
along with Pittsburgh’s already
existing commercial and cultural
advantages.

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Building Bridges

What a differenge a decade can make.

In the early '60s, Pitt usually admitted only those students able to
tackle a rigorous and rigid academic load, which Pitt usuallv

provided.

But, in the past 10 to 12 years, state-relatedness, the quality of
high school education and other factors have forced the University
to lower its standards, at least in admissions.

Statistics cited recently by College of Arts and Sciences Dean
Robert Marshall show Pitt is admitting many students who, like
athletes and U-CEP students, need academic assistance if they are
to survive even the least difficult of Pitt’s courses of study. But,
until recently, only athletes and U-CEP students were given the
opportunity to receive that help.

It is obvious there can be no gap between what enrollees can do
and what they are expected to do.

Whether it is desirable or not, Pitt cannot return to the days in
which foreign language was required and everyone recognized a
Shakespeare play. Today’s Pitt students, especially in the arts and
sciences, are different because of the economic situation and the
area in which Pitt finds itself.

The current statistics should not be interpreted by Pitt
administrators as an alarm whose cause can be corrected by the
rejection of all but the academically elite. The elite, it appears, will
have an honors program. Those somewhat below average should
also have an opportunity to receive higher education at a state-
related school, and in western Pennsylvania, Pitt is it.

But the fact remains that teaching Plato becomes difficult when
some students have trouble with the book’s introduction. A sink-
or-swim attitude won’t do much for a student who has trouble
floating, yet this is a good illustration of what has been the case at
Pitt.

Marshall advocates, and we agree, that Pitt should place a
greater emphasis on retention of those students to whom Pitt has
made a commitment through acceptance.

While this calls for the implementation of more basic-skill
programs and, perhaps, less student freedom in scheduling,
academic standards that have withstood state-relatedness should be
preserved. And the honors program, if accompanied by equally
strong programs designed for others, should be encouraged to
flourish.

But if Pitt wants to keep the ivy on its walls, it will in fairness,
also, have to empty its halls.

The Season To Make Promises

By R. DAVIDTIVE The , same is true for political

promises. People tend to accept

It’s hard to believe it's the

' beginning of November already.
Why, in just a couple of weeks, it ,_
- will be “The season to be jolly.”

Right now, however, it is the season
to make promises.

‘With Election Day only six
sunrises away, it it appropriate to
paraphrase the wise politician who
once said, “Never have so few
promised so much to so many with
so little result, proving that you can
fool all thepeople all the time.” Or
something like that. It ‘is ﬁtting,
therefore, that we should take a look
at political promises and learn how
to deal with them.

It has become the in thing today
to paint all politicians with one
brush, to call them all liars and
crooks, andto let it go atthat. While
it is true that some politicians are
liars, someare crooks and some are
both, most are neither, and we
should not assume that all are,
simply becauseit is easier to make
that  than to make the

eﬁottto  the truth.

them or reject them, in toto,
because it is easier to do that than to
analyze each on its merits. But if
one takes a good hard look at them
and gives them some critical
thought. some interesting things
may appear. Two examples from
the current election prove the point.
This year, we are electing a
number of judges to various
benches, ranging from Allegheny
County Court of Common Pleas to
the Pennsylvania State Supreme
Court. As has been the case for the
past decade, most of the candidates
are running on anti-crime plat-
forms. Maﬁy of them would have us
believe that if they are elected, they
will single handedly make our
streets safe by throwing all
criminals in jail for life. That is an
exaggeration, but the point re-
mains. Most voters hear those
promises, agree with them, and
voila, we have a new judge. ,
Ifone stops to look at it, however,
two glaring facts emerge. First,

Letters To The Editor

Student Assails Library Noise

There is a particularly insidious
kind of environmental pollution
going on at Pitt. The pollutant is
noise; the environment is the study
environment if Pitt’s libraries,
especially Hillman.

Signs are posted conspicuously
in all of Pitt’s libraries requesting
library users to study quietly,
except in group study rooms, to
smoke only in designated areas,

and not to bring food or beverages
into the library at all.

Why is it, then, that our study
environment is being polluted by
full-voice conversations, accom-
panied by the slurp of coffee or
pop, the crackle of food wrappers,
and the crunch of Fritos?

Can’t it be that some Pitt
students cannot read, and there-
fore cannot understand the signs

Oakland Patron Rips

Bar Cover Charge

It’s hard to believe that in this
consumer-conscious age, Pitt stud-
ents put up with the antics of
Oakland bar owners, who charge a
$1 cover charge. Not only that, but
once the cover charge is paid, one
ﬁnds out that the drink prices are
outrageous. Inthe article “Oakland
Bouncers Do More Than Card,”
(Pitt News, Oct. 10), it was stated
that one of the reasons for the cover
was to make up for those who come
into bars and don’t drink. Mean-

deals with Criminals. Most of the
judges of the Court of Common
Please work in civil HlluI.Cl'S such as
law suits, in divorce proceedings, in
orphan’s court or in any one of a
number of other divisions. On any
given day, only a small percentage
of judges handle criminal cases. In
addition, the State Supreme Court
doesn't handle trials of criminals. It
deals with appeals over interpreta-
tions of the law from lower courts,
which occasionally involve cases in
which someone is accused of a
crime. It is unlikely any judge on
either of those courts could have
much of a drastic impact on the
crime problem in our state.

A second relevant fact is that
every year, for nearly 10 years, we
have elected a batch of new judges.
Most of these judges have promised
to throw all criminals in jail until the
sun no longer shines and the grass
no longer grows. This is an
exaggeration, but only a slight one.
Yet in spite of these promises, the
crime problem continues to exist.
This seems to suggest that merely
electing  iudgesi is not

while, girls, who are known for their
remarkable ability to nurse one
drink for hours at a time, are let in
free. Maybe the girls don’t realize
they are being used. Let the girls in

follow. I just wish some student‘
organization would organize a
boycott. Then we would see how
fast these ripoff establishments
would come crying on their knees.

the solution. It seems to say that
maybe we should ask more of our
judges than how many years they
will put a purse snatcher away.

A second example from this
year’s election is the so-called steel
referendum. , It asks voters, in
essence, to choose between clean
air and good health on one hand and

employment and the ability to feed 

one’s family on the other. The
implicit promise being made is if we
change the anti-pollution laws, we
will have increased employment. At
ﬁrst glance, the choice looks easy.
One can live withiilirty air, maybe
not for as long, but one can live. Our I
ancestors did. One cannot,
however, live without food.
If that's all the thought voters

give to the matter, the referendum
willipass almost unanimously. If,
however, they look closely and
analyze the promise of jobs in return
for dirty air, there may be a
different result. There are many

other factors involved in the

referendum, as was pointed out in a
column on these pages on Monday.
Without going into the details here,

nor occupy themselves appropri-
atelv in a library? Unfortunately, it
is more likely that a few students
simply do not care that they are
abusing the rights of the rest of us.

I urge a campaign by all whose
rights are being thus abused. In a
ﬁrm and unequivocal whisper tell
the person at the next table to stop
polluting your study environment,
to be quiet or to leave!

From Top To Bottom,Pitt Buildings StackUp..,

By BARB THOMAS

The architecture on the Pitt
campus is varied and seems to have
no continuing theme—the Cathed-
ral is neo-Gothic, the buildings on
the bill are Grecian, the science
buildings are modern. However,
one theme unites these buildings:
all have interesting backgrounds.

‘Originally, the campus was to be
patterned after the Acropolis in
Greece. From Pennsylvania Hall to
the Cathedral of Learning, the
buildings were designed clas-
sically. These buildings are Old
Engineering, Th'aw, Mineral
Industries, Alumni and Pennsyl-
vania. Remodeling still is taking
place. A recently-built tunnel for
the handicapped extends from

Alumni Hall to the Chemistry

Building. '

Quadrangle area contained the

The Litchﬁeld Towers were
chartered in 1961, with the idea of

The Langley complex was not

The three neo-Gothic buildings
on the lawn also were not built
together. The Cathedral was
chartered ﬁrst, in 1937, then the
Stephen Foster Memorial (named
after the Pittsburgh-born
composer) and then Heinz Chapel.
The chapel is not named after its
benefactor, H.J. Heinz, but after
his mother.

The Frick Fine Arts Building was
donated by Henry Clay Frick’s
daughter, who designed the
building after an Italian cloister.
She pays for the building’s upkeep

walls.

Benedum was built in cooperation with Pltt’s School of Engineering. Although

reports of it sinking are as widespread as the theories about California slipping
into the Pacific, it’s still intact except for the cracks in the walls.

Chaos In Pitt ’s Laundries i’i

By JOHN FINN
Pitt News Staff Writer
In the corner of a dim lit closet is a
bulky, faded denim laundry bag.
Each morning, as part of his daily
routine, he gathers his clothes that
are strewn about the room the
previous day and stuffs them into
this bag without regard to color or
material.

Toward the end of the week, the
bag begins to ﬁll. When there isn't
room for even one more sock it
means “W-Day” is here: Wash
Day.

Learning to wash clothes is one of
the extra beneﬁts—-or hassles,
depending on how you look at it—of
a college education.

The resident students at Pitt take
advantage of the laundries provided
in the dormitories. At the Towers,
the laundry is located in the
basement of Tower B. In the other
residence halls, laundries are
located in either the basement or
the top ﬂoor of the building.

Because Pitt is largely a

’commuter school, students natur-

ally have their wash done at home.
However, the commuter statistic is
a misleading one because students
who live off-campus in fraternity
houses or apartments are techni-

cally referred to as commuters by

the University, although they do not
live at home.

Most fraternities and apartment
dwellers in Shadyside take their
laundry to one of four laundromats:
Centre Avenue, Schenley, Supreme
or Betty Brite.

At the laundry on Centre Avenue,
you can have your clothes washed,

'dryed and folded for you. This is

particularly enticing to fraternity
members and people who hold jobs
or are involved in time consuming
activities and don't have time to
wash their own clothes.

In South Oakland, many apart-
meht residents rely on Pitt Hand
Laundry on Bouquet Street to have
their clothes washed.

Initially, the experience of
washing one’s clothes is traumatic.
Most people are mature enought to
handle a reasonable amount of
responsibility by the time they enter

college, but when it comes to '

washing clothes, the cry rings out
across campus, “Mom, help!”

One of the most common
mistakes made by freshmen
washing clothes for the ﬁrst time is
a failure to separate colors.

“All I did was throw my red
football jersey on top of my load of
white clothes,” said one embar-
rassed freshman,
came out pink. You can’t play
football with pink socks.”

forlorn freshman is that of how
much detergent to use. “I wasn't
sure how much to put in,” said
another forlorn freshman, “so I put
in half the box. My clothes were
never cleaner, but when I went to
play basketball, there were soap
bubbles coming out from under my

arms.” _
These accidents are by no means

limited to freshmen or males.

an athletic supporter. I was never
so embarrassed .in my life, and,
needless to say, I had some
explaining to do.”

Perhaps nothing haunts a student
as much as a dryer. You can almost
read a students lip as he stands in
front of a dryer with an article of
clothing. The response is universal:
“Hmm, I wonder if this will
shrink.” Usually, it does.

 Pose Problems

There are an inﬁnite number of
similar stories concerning students
and washing clothes. The two go
together like rain and picnics——not
very well.

There are also cases of students
“getting even” with the machines
as well as fellow classmates.

Some students have been known
to take another students clothes out
ofthe machine in mid-cycle and toss
them into a corner in order to use
the machine.

One student found a way to ripoff
the machine. “I just put money in
the machine and push in the lever
until it clicks, he said, “then I pull
the money out and the machine
starts.”

According to the student, the
system is not fool proof, but it works
about 75% of the time.

Despite dirty clothes, soapy
T-shirts, pink socks and shrunken
pants, washing clothes can be an
enlightning, interesting, amusing
and educational experience.

Babys Music Well Received

By JIM FARERI
Pin News Staff Writer

Why does a young English rock
band decide to call themselves The
Babys? According to head Baby
John Waite, naming the group was
a matter of coming up with
something different enough to turn
heads.

“The Babys is an outlandish sort
of name in the tradition of The Who
and The Faces, ” said bassist-vocal-
ist Waite after The Babys’ debut
Pittsburgh performance at the
Stanley Theater Sunday night.
Waite, a- boyish Rod Stewart-type
who sparkles with plenty of British
rock star charm, lead his band
through a classy set that exceeded
the audience's preconception of the
relatively unknown foursome.

Opening the show was a new
American band, Piper, who, like the
Babys, have just released its second
album. Apparently, someone
forgot to tell this ﬁve-man outﬁt
they were only second on the bill.
They excited the near sell-out crowd
through with hot, racy rock and a
crafted stage presence.

Items of note in the Piper
inventory included several numbers

from its new album (“Can’t Wait”).

such as "Little Miss Intent,”

“Blues For The Common Man” and
the title track and an irnpeccibly
synchronized trio of guitars.

The Baby’s half of the show
actually began in the break between
sets as the roadies set up the band’s
elaborate drums and keyboards.
Expectations were raised when the
group was introduced by a man in
white tails and top hat, who
disappeared in a blinding ﬂash of
light as The Babys took the stage.

Before the audience could regain
vision, The Babys went into the first
chords of “If You've Got The
Time,” one of the best tunes on its
first album. The group’s music is
characteristically rooted in the
blues-oriented rock of earlier
British musicians, and apt compari-
sons are drawnpto Englishbands
like Free (now defunct) and Bad
Company. But these boys are no
mere imitators; its material and
style is fresh in its own right.

Waite described his music as
“very melodic." He insists on a
richer, more patient kind of rock ’n’
roll that isn’t just all rhythm and
chords. Waite also ‘advocates
variety and action in a live
performance: “You can’t just go out
and stand there like some bands
do,” he said. But The Baby’s did

        
     
     
     
   

 

    
 

much more than just move around.

Numbers from the new album
(“Broken Heart”) included, “Isn’t
It Time,” a slow, moody love song
as well as its hit single, "Give Me
Your Love,” a classic British mix of
rock and rhythm and blues and a
representative Baby’s tune. They
also played a version of the
high-rocking “Broken Heart,” with
a bit of “Wrong Or Right” thrown
in for good measure.

Captivating extras included a
synthesized keyboard solo by
Michael Corby and a short,
devastating drum solo by Tony
Brock. Both solos were elevated
into events by accompanying
lighting effects, which were excep-
tionally employed throughout the
night. ‘

Waite continually kept up a good
rapport with the audience; casually

pounded silly Sunday night at
Homestead’s Leona Theater by
Pure Prairie League. Loud music is
ﬁne, louder sometimes is helpful,
but not in this case. The first song,
“Outward Bound” revealed the
strength of electrical power.

Pulsating and pounding, Pure
Prairie League served its first
portion of ‘ ‘noise mush’ ’ vocals that
could not quite be understood. The
songs that followed included
“Lucille Crawﬁeld,” “Louise” and
“Heart of Her Own.”

The crowd, a partying lot,
seemed content with the frequent
driving guitar solos and with the
duets that showed little picking and
a lot of string bending. However,

Waite had reason to be in good
spirits. “We’ve been together for
18 months,” he said after the show.
“I never thought we'd make it this
far.”

No doubt the taste for bluesy
British rock isn’t what is used to be,
but between the freshness of youth,
charisma and innovation, and .
engaging, multitudinous live act:
The Babys may just have what it
takes to revive English rock in
America. Take shelter, Ted Nugent.

Rock Than Noise

crowd reaction was most intense
during “Let Me Fix Your Flat Tire,
Merle,” a song with clearer lyrics,
due to its slower, simpler lines.
The sound became most distinct
on the best received song of the
evening, “Amie.” The song was
not as loud because an acoustic
guitar was used, and it was the only
tune that showed the band at its
best. The words weren't drowned
out, and there was much less
distortion. Most of all, the song
could be heard above the crowd,
and the crowd was overwhelming.

Pure Prairie League had innova-
tive ideas and good staging, which
were demonstrated in most of the
numbers played. The singers

Pitt ’s Reutershan Unlikely Hero 

By KAREN KADILAK
Pin News Staff writer

For the past two games, the Pitt
offense has unveiled two unlikely
pass-catching heroes, Steve Gaus-
tad and Randy Reutershan, in
Panther wins over Syracuse and
Tulane. ’

Against Syracuse two weeks ago,
it was Pitt tight end Gaustad’s pass
catching that undid the opposition.
Gaustad seemingly came out of
nowhere to pull down a game high
six catches, two of which helped to

 

Stickwomen’s Offense Locked, 10-0

By SUE MCFARLAND

The Pantherette ﬁeld hockey
team traveled to I.ock Haven
Monday only to suffer their sixth
defeat of the season, 10-0, to the
number three team in the nation.-

The shutout occurred largely
because Pitt was unable to move the
ball to the goal—the Pantherettes
took only nine shots to I.ock Haven’s
20.

Pantherette goalie Robin Brust
picked up nine saves for the day.
After the game, the junior from
Hatsboro, Pa. .-_ commented, ‘ ‘They
were deﬁnitely an excellent team,
but I thought we played a good
game against a team that is ranked
as high nationally as they are.”

Lock Haven has long been a

set up Panther touchdowns, in
Pitt’s 28-21 comeback win over
Syracuse at Pitt Stadium.

This past week, the Pitt attack
got its best game, as far as catching
the football was concerned, from
another unexpected source—Reu-
tershan—as Pitt trounced Tulane,
48-0.

Reutershan, a sometimes starter

and full-time special teams terror,

nabbed four passes for 73 yards,
while filling in for the injured
Willie Talyor at ﬂanker. This

power in women’s ﬁeld hockey and
as a result has experienced good
recruiting years, drawing the best
players from the West as well as the
East. It is once again enjoying a
successful season sporting a 16-0-1
record.

Pitt’s second year head coach
Janet McDowell said of the game,
“lock Haven played a much more
aggressive game than we did. They
were just out of our league. What
can I say? We were outclassed and
outskilled.

“This is only the second year for
women’s ﬁeld hockey at Pitt, and at
this time we are in the process of
building,” McDowell added.

As freshman Becky Martin said,
“For a lot of our players this is only
the second year of ever playing the
game, yet when we played Lock

performance earned him offensive
player of the game honors in Pitt’s
convincing win over the Green
Wave at Pitt Stadium.

The senior ﬂanker, like Gaustad
a week before him, really didn’t do
anything spectacular in earning
pass-nabbing honors for the game.

Reutershan’s biggest gain went
for 37 yards (Gaustad’s long-gainer
was good for 31 yards against

Syracuse). But when Reutershan.

did get his hands on the ball, it paid
off. All of his pass receptions set up
Panther scores, just as two of
Gaustad’s grabs resulted in Pitt
six-pointers the week before
against Syracuse.

“I’d have to say they had the
poorest pass defense we’ve faced
this season,” Reutershan said, in
reference to the Tulane secondary.
‘‘It wasn’t that they were slow,
they just weren't fundamentally
sound.

Haven on Monday, 10 of the 11
players they had on the ﬁeld were
seniors. A few of its players are
even members of the U.S. hockey
team.” Martin, one of Pitt’s
experienced recruits of this year,
was a high school all-American at
her PIAA championship Manheim
Central High School.

The experienced players
McDowell will have to rely on next
year may be found in the
Pantherette junior varsity players.
The junior varsity squad also went
scoreless on the Lock Haven ﬁeld as
it sustained its second loss of the
season, 8-0. This brings its season
long record to a respectable 3-2.

The Pantherettes will end its
season on Nov. 3 with a home game
against Davis & Elkins.

“They seemed to have their
defense geared to stopping the
run,” Reutershan continued, “just

‘like Syracuse did against us last
'week. We were running what was

successful and it kept working.”

Against the Green Wave Satur-
day, what was successful for
Reutershan was a post, a curl, an
out and a broken pattern that
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh, who
had an outstanding game with 10
pass completions in 16 tries for 140
yards, completed to Reutershan.

“They let us throw underneath
the zone," Pitt head coach Jackie
Sherrill said. “That's why Randy
had such an excellent game. Giving
us the cushion, or the zone
underneath, we were able to
complete our medium range passes
to him.”

Reutershan, who will start again

in Saturday’s game between Pitt

 

and West Virginia at Morgantown
if Taylor’s ribs are still sore, knows
catching the football will be a lot
tougher this week than last.

The Mountaineers have a strong,
quick, ball-hawking defensive back
line Reutershan feels “may be the
strongest secondary faced this
season,” and a group of overly
vocal fans to support it and the
rest of the West Virginia team.

“When you talk about West

Virginia,” the senior from Mah- ~

wah, New Jersey, said, “you’re
talking about their fans. Talk about
enthusiasm? Their fans just Z’t
let up. It’s unbelievable.”

So was Reutershan’s perfor-
mance Saturday. The third time is
supposedly the charm, and Pitt
hopes it can unveil another
pass-catching hero on the order of
Reutershan or Gaustad at Morgan-
town Saturday.

Bradshaw Struggles With lnconsis tenc y

There is, within Western civilization, a ﬁxed belief that
the study of the past helps us to understand the present and
form the future. Considering this well-established theory,
one can be only increasingly mystiﬁed by the play this
season of Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback Terry Bradshaw.

How can a man who has shown steady—though not
spectacular—-—improvement since his rookie year ﬁnd
himself playing more inoonsistently than ever? How could
he very capably lead the Steelers to the pinnacle of the
National Football League twice, only to resume the errors
which plagued him in his ﬁrst two seasons in the league?

A survey of Bradshaw’s past shows that he has had his
share of both success and failure. The failures, however,
can be found predominantly in the early stages of his career,
which began with the greatest of expectations in 1970. The

 

ﬁrst player chosen in the NFL draft that year, Bradshaw
responded with a season in which he learned that a superb
throwing arm alone does not make a good quarterback.
While he ignominiously topped the league with 24
interceptions, his physical ability was unquestioned; most
fans ﬁgured the mental half- would come later.

Bradshaw had a vastly improved passing year in 1971,
completing more than 54 percent of his passes, throwing for
13 touchdowns and running for ﬁve. But once again, the
critical factor was interceptions: 22.

The 1972 season brought Franco Harris to Pittsburgh, a
move that directly led to two major developments: the
Steelers became a run-oriented team, and they made it to
the playoffs for the ﬁrst time in the history of man. Harris
was superb and Bradshaw complemented him effectively
with a competent passing game: he threw only 12

' interceptions.

Bradshaw had a disappointing year in 1973, -for with

Franco hurt muchof the season the Steelers were forced to t

Ill

throw more and Bradshaw did not respond strongly to the
challenge. The season reached a horrible bottom for.the
young man from Louisiana in a game at Three Rivers
Stadium against the Cincinnati Bengals. Bradshaw had
been having a poor game when, in the third quarter, he
suffered a separated shoulder. As he limped off the ﬁeld in
agony, the frustrated Steeler fans cheered in jubilation, a
move that Steeler President Art Rooney said, “almost made

. me sick.” The Steelers staggered through the rest of the

season and, even with Bradshaw back, were blown out in the
playoffs against Oakland.

  

The NFL Players’ Association voted to strike the ’74
pre-season camps, and Steeler rookie Joe Gilliam blazed his
way through the camp and into a starting job at quarterback.

Through the ﬁrst six games (in which the Steelers were a
disappointing 4-1-1), Bradshaw was in for only 2'passes.

But when Jefferson Street’s aerial extravaganza began to
run out of wind, Bradshaw regained his starting job and led
the Black and Gold to the playoffs for the third straight year.
And once there, he was nothing short of brilliant. He
completed 60 percent of his passes with three TDs and only
one interception as the Steelers blitzed three post-season
opponents and inscribed their names on the Super Bowl IX
trophy. Most important for Bradshaw, he had acquired that
extremely vital intangible: the conﬁdence and secure

self-assuredness that he could play football under the
greatest of pressures. ‘

P

If ’74 was good for Bradshaw, '75 was even better. Now
unchallenged as the Steelers’ number one quarterback, the
big blond completed 58 percent of his passes, threw for 18
touchdowns and again guided Pittsburgh to the Super Bowl
crown. In 17 games, he was intercepted only 14 times. His
play-calling was sharp and reflected the coming of poise and
maturity; it appeared he had paid his dues to the defensive
backs of the NFL.

But something funny happened to Terry Bradshaw on his
way to superstardom, and whatever it was, or is, it is a ost
puzzling problem. ‘W

In ’76 the Steelers were out to win themselves a chunk of
immortality by taking an unprecedented third straight
Super Bowl. Bradshaw was hampered throughout the year
by both a neck and a back injury, but regained his form of ’75
in the Steelers’ opening playoff game against the—Baltimore
Colts, as he threw for three touchdowns in a 40-14 rout.

But the following week, the bad boys from Oakland sent
the Steelers home in a box, the Raiders dominating not only
Bradshaw but also the entire Steeler team. Observers cast a
suspicious glance to 1977 to see which Terry Bradshaw
would return: the impatient, unsure one whom Oakland
stiﬂed, or the calm, take-charge commander who led the
Steeler romp over Baltimore. _ 7

Unfortunately for Bradshaw and Steeler fans al' , ,
manifestations have shown up this year; Terry has been
unpredictable as never before. Good against San Francisco,
terrible against Oakland. Good against Cleveland, terrible
against Houston (four interceptions in the ﬁrst half). But
then he was back up to good in the crucial game against
Cincinnati, and he followed that with a ﬁne performance as
the Steelers routed the Oilers. Had Bradshaw found the
groove once more?

  

Last Sunday’s Baltimore game would seem to indicate
that no, he most certainly has not. He threw ﬁve
interceptions in what I must call the worst game I have ever
seen him play. Steeler broadcaster Myron Cope summed up
Bradshaw’s apparent color-blindness by saying that every
once in a while Bradshaw has games like this in which he 5
can't seem to help but hit the defenders. :-

As to the cause of this most strange effect, Bradshawjisi
confused, Coach Chuck Noll is confused and certainly the
fans are confused. But perhaps by the end of the season,

. Bradshaw’s carer will have resumed its upward swing. And
_if history is to be believed, it  f

Is There Life Outside of the Dorms?

By Deanna Louise

Pitt is a commuter school. Over 20,000

' students from Pittsburgh and its suburbs

shake the campus awake between 7 a.m.
and 10 am. It's difficult to define who
these . people are. University
administrators agree they are the majority
of Pitt students, and quote statisitcs
placing them between 60 percent and 90
percent of the population.

There is no commuter stereotype.
The commuter student has many
identities—housewife, businessman,
high school graduate, fu|l—time
employe, mother, child, professor,
secretary. They are a sampling of the
population, and saying, “this is what it's like
to be a commuter" is like saying, “this is
what it's like to be a person."

Commuting between the educational

world and the social world makes
college an impersonal vacuum for many.
And the shuttle from independent adult
and student to someone’s child can be
devastating. While some commuters
feel restrained. by parental influences,
others find house duties cumbersome,
and deplore wasting time in transit.

Although they form a majority,
commuters are at the periphery of

campus life. Separation of a student's

social world and educational world

Bearina touise is a writing major at

Pitt who commutes from Point Breeze.

breeds apathy toward activities, most of
which seem oriented toward the
dormitories. The commuter’s college
life easily can be shallower than, and
certainly is different from, that of the
resident student.

The commuter living with parents is
more likely to continue in the role of
child than a dorm student who is far
away from home. “As long as you're
under my roof, you'll do as I say," is a
common statement made by parents
who provide room and board for their
student-child. For a person who
resists this psychological stronghold
during his years in college, meals with
the family can be a strain. Although
each person absorbs the attitudes and
tendencies of those in his immediate
environment, many people come to
think for themselves.

It's hard, in fact wrong, to generalize
about the tendencies of commuters
living with theirparents. “Living at home
is only a problem if a difficulty already
exists there,” said Dr. Tom Schlesinger
of the University Counseling and
Placement Center. During the last
decade, Schlesinger said, Pitt students
with homelife problems have been a
steady clientele at the center. “Home
may be the sole source of frustration or
only a contributing factor," Schlesinger
said. “Quite often, students don't
recognize the problem as such.”

In the Apartment

‘‘I spend more time at Pitt than in my
apartment,” explained Anita Tyler, a
former dorm dweller, who now must take
a bus to school. “That's kind of
sickening. Distance keeps my friends
from visiting. I visit their dorms, and I call
them."

Anita, a night student living 15 to 20
minutes from campus, is a senior in
Business Administration. Her family's
home is 300 miles from Pittsburgh. She
spent three years in the donns, but
decided to move away from Pitt because
she felt she could never escape from
school while in the dorms.

“Everytime I looked out the window, I
saw the Cathedral. I couldn't escape it.
Moving has helped. You kind of leave it
behind when you live away from Pitt.”

Anita feels dorm students tend to
isolate themselves as much as
commuters, and remain unfamiliar with
Pittsburgh outside of Oakland. “Students
from the dorms may go to Carnegie
Mellon, Carlow, or possibly Chatham, but
no one would go to Point Park or
Duquesne. It's too far."

Anita spends her free time with her
friends. ‘‘I’m in the donns mostly. Almost
everyone I know is from out of town and
they don’t like it here.”

By moving out of the dorms, Anita has
also moved out of the worid of the donn
student. Her friends are unwilling to visit
her, because, she says, “they don't have

By M.H. G.

By Martha H. Garvey Jr.

“lt's easier living on campus. I can't
study on a bus. I am extremely distracted
at home. Everything’s in Oakland," says
Ellen Hoffman, a senior in the School of
Education, and a commuter from Carnegie.

Ellen was a commuter her freshman year
and spent her sophomore and junior years
in an apartment in Oakland. By the first half
of her freshman year’, after several months
of bus schedules and hassles with parents,
she knew she wanted to live in Oakland.
Living in Oakland allowed her to spend a lot
of time with her fiance, and gave her more
time for studying.

While she never has been involved in
any organizations, Ellen feels she was able
to participate more in things happening on
campus. ‘‘When I lived in Oakland, I never
missed a football game. They knew me in
Chances R. Lan'y—my fiance and l—used
to hit the movies and plays.”

Elen decided to move back home when
a friend from Mexico, Maru, came to visit
her and to study at Pitt. “Maru is a big
reason for staying in Carnegie,” Ellen said.
‘‘I am sure I could have afforded living in
Oakland—but without her. I can't ask ‘her
to share the rent. But I'm not sorry she's
here."

Elen feels an increase in family conflicts
since she's been back home. ‘‘It's always
little stuff—like who overloaded the
refrigerator. And my mom talks all the time.

"I get along much better with my parents
when I live away. My mom and I talked to
each other when we‘ really had something
to say. "

At Home

 

N_vs waner photo

While she feels in some ways she has
broken from her parents’ values, Ellen
feels physically restricted by her parents:
‘‘I don't have to be home for dinner—|
can't, I work—but I have to go to bed at 1 1
p.m. because my parents go to bed at 1 1,
and they don't like the lights left on after
they go to bed."

Ellen was speaking on the phone from
her fiance's apartment. Her’ fiance has
moved to an apartment very close to her
house, but Ellen still feels she spends less
time with him now that she's commuting.
She has little time for friends in between
work and school. What free time she may
have is usually spent at Hillman Library.
She misses the atmosphere of Oakland:
“Oakland is more home to me now, but
now commuting I spend less time with my
fiance, and zero time with my friends.
Zilch. You miss something."

Martha H. Garvey Jr. is a junior writing
major at Pitt.

Going away to live at college is a
springboard to adulthood for a portion of
society's members, Schlesinger said. Of
course, some people aren't prepared to
take the responsibility for their own lives
until their late 20's or after. College,
prep schools and running away from
home are vehicles for the transition from
adolescence to adulthood. Enrolling at
an educational institution is the socially
acceptable route, although not
necessarily the best route for everyone.

go home," Kathy said. ‘‘It is kind of hard
to meet people.
parking, it’s hard to come in at night and
get involved. It's also easier to study at
home. Here you always want to do
something."

Kathy said she will submit an
application for a dormitory room next
year. “The only reason I'm commuting
is because I applied late last time.”

She said she gets along well with her
parents, but doesn't feel totally
independent. “There probably would
be things I would do on campus that I
wouldn't do at home, because my
parents disapprove of them.”

Kathy has graduated to grade 13.
She has one home, not the two common
to resident students. She studies, eats,
sleeps and socializes there. The
horizons of her formal education have
expanded infinitely since high school,
but her potential for character
improvement through interaction with
others is limited.

A complete break from the family is
not necessary for everyone, though.

to Pitt's Johnstown campus, and Sue
commuted from Boston to the University of
Massachusetts.

“I liked living at home. It wasn't a
matter of getting away from my
parents," Sue said. ‘‘I never had the
idea to move away."

“Saving money wasn't my
consideration for living at home," Kim
agreed.

“Because I had a one hour drive to .

Boston each day, my parents made
exceptions for me," Sue said. ‘‘I didn't

going home," Kim said.

Neither Sue, who has three brothers,
nor Kim, an only child, found studying at
home a problem. Kim said, ‘‘I can't even
remember studying at the branch
campus."

Living at home can provide a
reciprocal education for parents and
student, especially when your father is a
jeweler and you register for a gem
cutting course, as Kim did.

“My parents helped contribute ideas
to my political science papers’ and
sometimes read over them.” Sue said.

Arby’s and Sera-Tec Biologicals, the
bank clock that blinked 9:57 (late again)
and the burned-out Strand Bowling sign.
My view of Oakland, through grime-
spattered U-Bus‘ windows, narrowed
like a bowling alley, with the Cathedral
as a grotesque head pin.

I stumbled off the bus at Hillman
Library, clutching the tell-tale
commuter’s burden: a day‘s load of
books and folders and a crumpled bag
lunch. I ran to class and slipped into a
seat, feeling conspicuous and foreign,
like a housewife returning to college
after 20 years. And, like a housewife, I
lived in a suburban world of lawns,
family dinners and next—door neighbors.
For me, Pitt ended at 5 p.m., when the
1 1 U sighed to a stop across from the
Cathedral.

In class, conversation floated around
me——talk of roommates, cafeteria food,
weekend plans. My remarks were
limited to coursework and professors’
eccentricities. Other students, with
their room keys and meal tickets, were
unreal to me. All I had was my ID and a
wrinkled bus pass. I never would run
into them in Towers lobby or Hillman
some evening, or sit near them at a
Pangborn movie.

College life is fluid. Around me,
people were changing, discarding and
remolding their ideas, friends, habits

and lives. But how could I change,
when I came home every night and
dumped my books, high school-style,
on the kitchen counter?

‘As my life narrowed, l clung to the
few high school friends who attended
Pitt. We ate lunch together, an isolated
circleon the Cathedral lawn when the
weather was good, a group huddled in
the neo-Gothic shadows of the
Commons Room when the weather was
bad.

Even this enforced togetherness
was preferable to the days when, due to
schedule or sickness, I was left alone. I
sought refuge in a nook in the Cathedral
or in a chair in Hillman. There, I felt safe.
My loneliness was not exposed, as-it

The Lonely Long Distance Commuter

- Wilson photo
was the few times I Ioitered in Burger
Chef, using a Pitt News (filled with
events I couldn’t participate in) as a frail
defense against the chatter around me.
I also was saved from wandering
through the decaying, Hot L Baltimore-
like Student Union, with the sinking
sensation of being checked out—and
rejected-30 times in as many seconds.

In the evening, during the long, rush-
hour bus ride, I lapsed into commuter
mononucleosis, as the jargon of poli sci
50 or math 80 jangled in my head, and
the world—the guarded faces of the
other riders, the graying scene
outside—pressed in with relentless
ugliness.

At home, life continued in the
disjointed, empty pattern of high school.

   

‘.'.'s:.i>e'..

to PATI

I».

  

Weekday nights blurred by with TV or
study. More television than study—it
was hard to concentrate, and the loud,
mindless action on the tube numbed my
fatigue. Weekends slipped away with
bickering or reading. I took trips to silly
movies and aimless drives to escape the
house and the sensation of endless
childhood.

I decided to move to Oakland one
winter night when the U Bus didn't
come. I stood in the bus shelter across
from the Cathedral for 45 minutes, the
cold attacking my feet and my book-
cramped hands. I had a headache, and
hated the prospect of taking a 70's bus
and blundering downtown in the dark,
looking for my bus stop.

I walked to the Cathedral basement
and called home, the only person in the
row of phone booths. A ride? O.K. My

. mother's voice sounded remote, long-

distance.

I hung up and trudged upstairs. The
Commons Room was deserted—chairs
pushed away from tables, lights
clouded, and stone gnomes grinning
spookily in the dusk. It reminded me of
a story in which a man wandered
through an empty town; each building
he entered seemed to have been
deserted the moment before. My
footsteps‘, hurrying outside, sounded
loud and hollow.

I stood on the Cathedral balcony for a
long time, hands hooked onto the cold
stone railing, watching my frozen breath
dissolve in the night. I looked out on

Oakland, the small warm lights in the
library and the Towers, trying to imagine
the people living behind them. I failed.
One group of people, then another,
passed beneath me, laughing.

After a while, I went to meet my ride. _

  
        

 
 
   
 

By Wendy Rich

Every freshman bus commuter starts out the first term with a kind of virginity, a
blessed unknowningness of the workings of PAT. To those rare souls who have never
had occasion to enjoy a Pittsburgh bus ride, I salute you for your ingenuity. However,.
these fortunate souls have missed out on a whole world of experiences that my fellow
commuters and I know only too well.

Commuters, think back, before you became hardened. Before you kicked at white-
haired old ladies just to have a pole to hang onto. Before you experienced that sinking
sensation in the pit of your stomach as the bus rolled into view and you realized you
had no change. Before all that, when you were trusting, innocent and gullible.

Little did we know of the ungodly morning hours when we would have to get up, just

to catch a bus for 10 a.m. class. No one told us that after gulping our breakfasts and
racing to the bus stop 10 minutes early, the bus already would have been there, or be
at least 20 minutes late. If and when the bus did arrive, there was a good chance it
wouldn’t stop, but race by, leaving us standing, choking in a cloud of dust.
. I went to the freshman orientation lecture on commuting, and I listened to the PAT
spokesman very closely. Then’ I went to an event called “The Trials of Connie
Commuter." where I was told commuting’s benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. How
could they have lied to us? What they should have given us was a lesson in the Fine
Art of Commuting.

The Fine Art of Commuting consists of skills slowly Ieamed and slowly cultivated to a
state nearing perfection. A true commuter can time it so he or she amves at the bus
stop at almost precisely the same time as the bus. If you are really good, you will have

\/

  

made friends with the bus driver, and, some morning when you are late, you might find
him waiting for you.

There is also the Fine Art of Sleeping on the Bus. This neocesitates getting a
window seat, so you are not disturbed by people getting off, and also always having
some article of clothing you can wad up and use as a pillow. Note: The pillow is
neccesary so when the bus hits a pothole, your head won't go through the window.
Also, you will find yourself developing a keen sense for waking up exactly at your stop.
Again, having friends on the bus who know you (such as the driver) will help on the
days your timing slips up. . I _

Once you arrive at Pitt, you blend in with all the other students quite well. The only
earmarks are dark circles under the eyes, an incredible load of books and a vaguely
lost look. If you are a thoroughly experienced commuter, these signs will soon fade.

As for me, I showed my ignorance for some time. My first day of commuting I ended
up in Penn Circle with a transfer clutched in my sweaty hand. In a state bordering on
hysteria, I begged total strangers for help. Suffice to say, I got home that night, else I
might still be wandering in East Liberty. ’

Now, I'm an old hand at commuting. I've developed an alarming squint from trying to
read bus destination signs, and my change purse always bulges. I have even struck
up a friendly acquaintance with a few bus drivers. Yes, I'm quite indoctnnated to
commuting now, but knowing I wasn't alone those first few weeks, and that others
were botching up, too, really helped me. So, if you’re still not at ease with PAT, relax.
Some people take longer to lose their virginity than others, that’s all. ‘

Wendy Rich is a freshman commuter who lives in Springdale, a 45 minute to L

an hour commute to Pitt.

Life on the Outside

with commuters as satellites to this
activity. Usually, each group is oblivious
to the other.

Karen Christie was in Burger Chef
eating a bag lunch, one hard-boiled egg
and a grapefruit, when she talked about
commutino from Monroeville, where she
lives with her aunt, uncle and their five
children.

“I just flunked a midterm. I don’t
study very much,” Karen said,
“although last night my aunt tried to
keep the kids quiet because I had an
exam.

“My aunt is great to talk to, but it's
hard to study there. Plus, I really don’t
have much time between commuting
and work."

Karen works part time at the K-Mart
in Monroeville to pay for room and board
at her relatives’ house. The 10 or 15
hours she spends commuting each
week is as time consuming as a second
part time job.

‘‘I’m going to apply for winter term
housing. I can’t attend functions here at
night because the last bus home leaves

\ around 6 p.m. It's insane. There was a

meeting for commuters and PAT
officials here a few weeks ago, and I
wanted to go but I couldn't. It was later
than the last bus home,” Karen said. ‘‘I
can’t do much here; even meeting
people is difficult."

A commuter must make a special
effort to form the friendships that come
more easily to dormitory residents.
Shyness, awkwardness or fear of
rejection inhibit many students from
forming strong friendships on campus.
Commuter loneliness is common. Most
make some effort to meet other
students, but resent the difficulty being
a commuter imposes on this effort.

One junior economics major said her
friendships at Pitt are “one term.”

“Once a class is over, and our
schedules change, you automatically
grow apart.... Most of my friends are
commuters, and some are from my high

school. You meet a lot in Burger Chef,
Uncle Charlie's or on the bus."

It takes this student one and a half

hours to reach Pitt from her home in

Being Involved

David Goldman is a Junior political
science major. He always has lived at his
home in Pittsburgh, and it takes him an
hour and 45 minutes to reach Pitt from
Stanton Heights. He currently is carrying
15 credits and working 1 1 hours a week
in Hillman Library. In addition, he
estimates he spends from six to seven
hours a week on activities_ and
organizations.

David is a member of the College
Young Democrats, _the Committee on
Student Organizations, the Owl and also

does a weekly sports commentary for
WPGH. He also is pledging a social
fraternity.

While David admits he is not “totally
involved in all of my activities,” he does
say that “rather than just going to
school...it’s better to get involved than
just to sit in classes."

But David is at a loss to explain why he
is involved in all these activities, when it
seems many commuters aren't. ‘‘I really
get more enjoyment out of my activities
than my classes," David says. Politics,
though, does provide a focus for both
his academic and social life.

“I've always found politics interesting. I
worked very hard on the Frank Lucchino
mayoral primary campaign and will try to_
involve myself in the Caligiuri for Mayor
campaign-”. A

David, as a member of the
undergraduate Committee on Student
Organizations, is in the process of
evaluating various student organizations
for the Student Government Board.
While he acknowledged there is a
problem involving commuters in campus
organizations, he could see no solution.

Nyswaner photo
“That's just the way it is. Most colleges
are set up this way. The only really good
activity time for commuters is in the
aftemoon-—but everyone is in class.”

David lives with his younger brother and
his mother. His brother also attends Pitt.
“He is a freshman and not at all involved in
activities. He's still getting his feet wet,”
the older Goldman states.

David says he prefers Stanton Heights
to the center of the city, though he
spends most of his time in Oakland. He
doesn’t feel hampered by living at home.

“I’ve thought about living in Oakland.
Sometimes I thought it would be nice,
though I prefersuburban living. At home I
can get a car anytime I want, and home-
cooked meals.”

' David said half of the reason for living at
home is economic. ‘‘I feel comfortable at
home,” he said. “For the most part, I
have enough privacy. I haven't had any
problems. My mother doesn’t intervene.”

By M. H. G.

accompany them. If Oakland crime
keeps them behind bolted apartment

doors, they may avoid campus
activities.
Generally, campus organizations

gear their functions and meetings
toward the resident student or Oakland
apartment dweller, but some will
reschedule meetings if its long-distance
commuter members request it,
according to Committee on Student
Organizations chairmanwlichael Bates.
The CSO has rescheduled its meetings
to the afternoon to accommodate
commuters.

It is possible to build a social life on
campus, if a commuter can stay
overnight at a friend's house. John
Russon, Churchill, economics major,
stays in the dormitories with his friends,
or at one of the Oakland efficiency
apartments his father owns when
there's a party on campus or he has a lot
of work that must be done here.

John was staring over a textbook at
the other commuters studying in the
Commons Room when he said, ‘‘I
considered living in the donnltories to
get more involved in activities. Glee
Club rehearsals are in the evening, so I
didn’t try out for that. If I lived on
campus, I'd probably join a fraternity,
too. During Hell Week a pledge is
expected to spend a lot of time at the
fraternity, and I wouldn't be able to do
that.

“My free time on campus is spent
with the dorm students I know. I didn’t
have any problems making friends. I
stop to wonder if I have too many
friends. I don’t have enough time to
spend with all of them.”

Commuting doesn’t have to be a
hassle. Distance from campus imposes
extra hardships on the commuter, but

South Hills. The time consumed
traveling and the rigidity of bus
schedules make it impossible for her
even to find out if she wants to get
involved in campus activities, which
would afford her regular contact with
individuals who share her interests. She
is applying for on-campus housing next

year so she can “get more done on

campus,” and be close to facilities like
the library.
Being closer to_ campus affords
commuters the option to “get involved."
Accessability to campus makes it
easier for students to participate in
projects. These commuters often feel
uneasy about walking home alone when
it's dark, and arrange for friends to

none that aren't insurmountable with a
litt|e'effort. Not every commuter has
difficulty making friends, utilizing time in
transit and being at the bus stop on
time.
Or so it seems.
“Did the 67F go by yet?"
“Yes, just a minute ago.”
I “Shit.”
