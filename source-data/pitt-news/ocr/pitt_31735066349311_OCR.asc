Teachers’ Strike Jolts
Pitt School of Education

BY DENNIS ‘KELLY

The effects of the Pittsburgh

_.f":eachers’ strike are now being felt

at Pitt.

Students in the. School of

Education have been shut out of
classrooms in the City's Arlington,
Beechwood and Northview elemen-
tary schools, where they normally
would complete programs in

student teaching. These schools
closed Dec. 1 when the teachers’
walkout began. A

With the loss of these facilities,
there was an immediate need for

' reorganization. V

The number of education stu-
dents using the Falk school was
doubled, and" according to an

‘‘It was an emergency. situa-

regular basis we try to limit the use
of facilities to a one-time basis."

‘Edward Kiley, public relations
director for the Steelers, said, “In
fact, we had to change our planned
practice time in"order not to disrupt
classes.” ' —

Myslinski said that other than
the practices Friday and Saturday
by the Steelers, no further use of
the facilities by the Steeler team
was planned. “It's a public
relations move,” he said. “What

SGB Candidate=Field Definite

BY BILL MOORE
Five presidential candidates and

17 Board candidates had taken out
 A titions as of Sunday for the
%coming Student Government
Board (SGB) elections.

Seeking the
presidency will
be Larry Cha-_
ban, Joe Gron-
sky, Paul Hert-
neky, Mark Sat-
inoff and Barry
Weisband.

Hertneky was a Board member
during 1974 but was unsuccessful
in his presidential bid last year.

Satinoff, presently a Board
member, edged out Commuter
Association President Larry Cha-
ban by 25 votes in the 1975
election.

Weisband has never held elected
office in Student Government, but

 

is presently serving on the Board’s
allocations committee.

Gronsky is the -only fraternity
member seeking the top office.

Running for Board are Gary

Arcuri, Stefﬁ Brooks, Carl Cox,
Larry Gleason, Jo Ann Haller, Chip
Hubbard, Bill Kalman, Larry
Krain, Ezra Krieg, Robert Kurey,
Benita Marcus, Clifford Protzman,
Joe Scalamogna, Bruce "Stephen,
-Sue Turner, Bill Waddell and
Robin Wertkin. " *
Hubbard is the sole incumbent.
Gleason was expected to_run for
president but told The Pitt News
Friday he would not. ' ' ,

Most of this week will be spent
campaigning and filling petitions
with the required amount of names
in time for the Thursday deadline.
At present, the only announced
political party is the Young
Socialists. headed by Satinoff, but

others_ m1g'ht by formed before
Thursday. ‘

_ A major factor‘in this year’s -
election, according to many of the

candidates, "will be the endorse-
ments made later this week by_ the

fraternities. sororities, engineers

and other student groups.

Five of the Board candidates are
fraternity members and two are
sorority members, including, Pan-_
hellenic Society President Turner.
None, however, is in the Engineer-
ing School.

In previous years, the Greeks
and engineers endorsed the same
slate of candidates, but no decision
will be made this year until ‘after
the 22 candidates have been
interviewed, according to members
of both groups. A

The Pitt News will ‘carry
interviews with the candidates
beginning next week.

 

Clopp Hall Radiation

Leak Called Harmless   

BY BRUCE WALDHOLTZ .

A leak discovered over the
Christmas vacation in a waste
container for radioactive liquid in
208 Clapp-Hall “was not a’ health
hazard" because of the minute
Quantities involved,” according to
Edward Durkosh, director of Pitt’s
Radiation Safety Office.

The leak was discovered on 

December 28 by Cathy Vergona, a
graduate student doing an experi-
ment in a laboratory headed by Dr.
Edgar F. Carell of the life sciences
department. The leak from a
ﬁve-gallon container had allowed
the liquid waste to flow out and
cover several feet of ﬂoor.

Carell was called home. and
the Campus Police were immedi-
ately summoned. Health and
Safety Officer,, Eugene Barry
nearby with a Campus Policeman
was ﬁrst to arrive in the lab. Barry
was unable to reach Durkosh, and
finally reached Barbara Fasiska,
Durkosh's assistant in the Radia-
tion Safety Ofﬁce. She arrived and,
with Barry’s help, placed the
leaking container into a larger one
and put down towels to absorb the
liquid. ' '

Durkosh, when reached, decided’

no danger was present, because of
the small amount of radioactive
material in Carel1’s lab, and that

there was no need fo'r.it‘to be_

cleaned until Monday morning.
Durkosh said the
radiation was much less than that
received in a medical or dental
X-ray. "

 Livewire: Freshmen Criticize 19-Meal Plan  

 i' Ihe'v*Uﬂi.V
.1 1 '4 _Y_. 1 ‘if 

 

BY GEORGENE KALEINA
Several freshman recently have criticized the
mandatory 19-meal-a.-week cafeteria plan as unfair

stipulation for living in the dorms.

One student complained he went home on weekends and

couldn't make use of the extra meals. Another student said
it was an unjustifiable extra expense imposed only on
freshmen. _

,President_ of Key Management—(professional food-service
contractors. for Pitt) Kinney J. Thens explained why the

._ T‘ - ' an is mandatory for freshmen. A“The first year on campus
‘' is hard for the student to decide how he should eat and we_ ‘

feel this plan helps,” Thens said.
-“ Another..reas'on_jthat it’s_ mandatory fo'_r.f_reshmen is that

   
  
 
 

 

base and this base is provided by the plan being mandatory
for some,” Thens added. . -

He said the food service probably would go broke
without the first-year mandatory board plan.

Under the present food-service plan, a student can eat
three meals for $2.83 a day, according to Thens. “If every

student showed up for every meal, it would be difficult to‘

operate under that $2.83,” Thens said. “The service
would have to cut back somewhere or raise the $2.83 a

day.” s _ . I .
' “T-here is one discrepancy in the meal plan, however,”

Thens’ said. “-Someone who is a very light eater usually
pays for the heavier eaters." ' ' ’ '
There may_' be some changes in the

_ _ M nextfew years,
‘ according to~Director of Auxiliary Services Tom Albert.

innovations such as an a la carte system for the cafeteria,.”
he said. “There may be changes by '77 or ’78.”

According to ’ Albert, there is only a $15-a-term:
difference between the 1‘4-meal plan and the 19-meal plan;
The 14-meal Dlan costs $283 a term, and the 19-meal plan,
costs $298 a.term.'
for ﬁve morermeals a week during the term. -

The student who misses meals usually makes up for it all

other meals, Thens said.

“Students also fail to realize that the service has to pay

for the people working in'the cafeteria, the dishes, utilities,

  New ROTC
Program
‘Going Well’

BY CHARLES W. OGG

The consolidation of Pitt’s ROTC
programs with those of Carnegie-
Mellon University and Duquesne is
going well, according to Dr. Donald
Goldstein, head of the Air Force
ROTC program.

Under the consolidation plan,
which wentiinto effect in July, all
Army ROTC instructors operate
through Pitt’s ROTC department,
either circulating among the three
universities or teaching courses at
Pitt to C-MU and Duquesne
students commuting to Oakland.’

‘ ‘Enrollment is up approximately
25% in the AFROTC program and

program,” Goldstein said. He was
unable to give exact ﬁgures this
early in the term. -

Goldstein attributed the rising
student interest in ROTC to the
state of .the economy and the
decrease in anti-military senti-
ment. _

At the time of the consolidation,
former AFROTC head Colonel
Donald D. Mueller said, “Right
now, we are struggling to keep our
program alive, despite the fact that
credits will not be awarded for
ROTC courses.”

When the Duquesne AFROTC
was cancelled, the Pitt program

from going on probation.

While the attention of most
students has been away from the
Air Force and Army ROTC
programs, both have [prospered
despite the fact that no credit is
given for the courses, and there
have been major changes in
personnel._ _ _I

In addition to the recent
appointment of Goldstein, who also
is afﬁliated with the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs, James Bambery has
replaced Col. John Roehrn. as head
of the Army ROTC.

Wilkinsburg. Turner, Kelly. John-
ston and Allison elementary
schools are training Pitt students.

“Overcrowding in these schools

is not a problem. as we've found.-

new qualiﬁed teachers who are

' willing to work with our students;"

Allen said.

If the strike is settled soon, there
will be no difficulty in swinging
back into a regular program.

According to Allen,‘ the students
have been scheduled to spend half
a term at their present schools and
the second half in the Pittsburgh
school system.

REAGAN FAVORED OVER FORD '

MIAMI (AP)—As Republican
presidential contender Ronald

Florida. his campaign ofﬁcials
predicted an outright 3-to-1 victory

_ A Controversial Clause

’ Through the swift action of the Resident Students Association (RSA),

allowed the raising of rates even after they were signed.

A Housing Office to make cost adjustments at any time was dropped afte

Tom Albert, who said that failure to notify the RSA was .an

The Housing Oﬁice, although no longer pressing the issue this year,

A seems dead set on such a clause for future’ contracts.

The need for a clause that allows room and board -prices to be

V‘ ' changed because of unforeseen cost escalations would arise from poor

_ *-planning on the part of the Housing Oﬁiee and not from erratic
‘ ﬂuctuations in the food and housing industries. ’

This kind of clause means nothing but trouble for students who like

to know what another year at Pitt is going to cost before putting their

BY ‘GENE GRABOWSKI

There has been a quiet rumbling
recently among the more literate
sector of Pitt’s student body over
the great number of young brutes

allowed entrance to its halls of

learning. “Why,” they ask with
resentment, “should these lum-
moxes come to Pitt on a four-year
scholarship to play brutal and
ofttimes idiotic sports when'they

. cannot even spell their own
names?” After all, they are taking .

the spots that might be put to much
better use by a hungry young
scholar who may do the school and
its reputation more good.

The truth of the * matter is,
though, that big-time football and
basketball are a lot of fun for many
students, for a handful of learned
professors and to almost all the
alumni and trustees. And you
cannot have big-time football when
you’re forced to suit up Phi Beta
Kappas——that is, if you can muster
enough Phi Beta Kappas willing to
soil their shirts in a game. ,

Big-time sports insures that most
of the frustrated-jock alumni will
contribute not only to the athletic
program but maybe even to the
library and faculty club while
they're at it.

In a recent column, Bill Kalman,

“off-base," the description of the’

United Nations’ vote on Zionism as
being a'denial of the national rights
of the Jewish people. Mr. Kalman
is correct on this point. The vote
did not represent a denial of the

national rights of the Jewish_

people, but instead, a denial of the

ridiculous in her statements. It
looks as though she perhaps dates

some ﬁneyoung boy an opportun-
ity to get a quality education. Most
of the athletes who leave this’

people. Instead of making
anti-semitic pronouncements
against Jews on an individual or
group basis, something which the
United Nations is not empowered

to do, it did the next best thing, '

which was to make slanderous
accusations against a country, the
majority of whose inhabitants are
Jewish. A

Mr. Kalman goes on to state,
“Zionism, from the very begin-
ning, was expounded by Theodor
Herzl as a means_ of colonizing an
empty area in the colonial world,
enslaving_ or driving out the
non-white, non-European popula-
tion.” In the first place, Zionism
did not begin with Herzl. Zionism
comes from the word “Zion."
which is the name of a mountain in
Judea or modern Israel. The
Zionist yearning began two thou-
sand years ago when the Jewish
temple was sacked by the invading
Romans and the majority of the
Jewish inhabitants were, as Mr.

-Kalman would phrase it, driven,

from their homeland .by the

L oppressive regimes of thecoloniai, -

expansionist Roman Empire.
Secondly, how could the Zionists
have enslaved the Arabs. and
driven them out at the same time?
Maybe there was a lottery to get rid
of some and the rest would be

What I suggest be done,
however, is "to make football and
basketball separate courses of
study like the others in
University. Athletes could major in
pre-professional football just _s

writing, psychology and economies
‘majors. As the situtation stands
now, athletes don’t get much out of
charading as physical education or
urban studies students.

Such a healthy dose of honesty,
which at ﬁrst might be painful,
would benefit all; Trustees and
administrators could still root for
the team they help sponsor and
students could still root for their
fellows on the ﬁeld. Athletes, while
being graded on their performance

- in the arena, would no longer have

to keep up the painful and

ridiculous sham of marching

class for their token grades.

Best of all, purists, like myself,
would no longer have need to feel

jealous of athletes because of their ’

special treatment. Nor would we be
angered because of the deprecation
they have ‘shed on our hard-earned
diplomas.

honest, square way of dealing with
what is now a ticklish situation-
and thus probably too much to ask
of our administration.

driven out of their homeland on
weekends and national holidays.
' Throughout his column, Mr.
Kalman quotes statements from
respected Israeli leaders, which it
would seem, would not be in their
best interest to make. What were
his sources? Why couldn’t he
document his assertions? -For
example, lwould be very interes-
ted to know where and when the
leader" of the party in power in the
Israeli government admits to
attacking Jewish housewives in a
market place. ‘
‘Mr. Kalman describes how

“legal restrictions are imposedﬁy

against Arab membership in trade
unions, attendance at universities

and voting." These allegations are .

patently false. Arabs in Israel can
vote, there are Arabs in the
Histradut Labor Organization, and
thcy- can and do attend universities

/

Finally, Mr. Kalman calls for
“the ending of the domination by
Zionist organizations, such as the
Histradut, the Israeli Army. and the
Mapai party.” In other words, he
is calling for the destruction of the
state of Israel which is what would
obviouslyresult if its Army, social

 An.Offer That
You Can't Refuse

I am writing with regard to the .

article in the Dec. 5 Pitt News
about Dr. Theodore Taylor. I
strongly object to the following
quote; “Crude nuclear explosives.
according to Taylor, can be built
relatively easily by one person. In
fact. once the necessary plutonium
is stolen, a bomb can beproduced

an entirely false impression of the
difficulty in constructing-a nuclear
bomb. j

* The following is a quotation on

that subject from Taylor's recent‘

book. Nuclear Theft: Risks and
Safeguards":

“Under conceivable circumstan-
ces, a few persons, possibly even

one person working alone, who’

» possessed about 10 kilometers of
plutonium and a substantial
amount of chemical high explosive

and build a crude ﬁssion bomb. By

technology and chemical , explo-
sions (and) would also have to be
willing to take moderate risks of
serious injury or death."

at Los Alamos:

for $8.95, costs $1.50 at Bryn

an opportunity to buy and sell used
books. Since the exchange is
entirely Pitt-organized and Pitt-

sponsored, students have a good‘

chance of ﬁnding required texts.
But, since each seller establishes,

his own price,- a little shopping.

around is necessary. A copy of
State and Local Government may
sell for $7.95 or for $2.50,
depending on the ambitions of its
owner.

So. ‘if you're a little short of cash
or suffer from claustrophobia in
long, stuffy lines, you maybe able
to ﬁnd books you need in‘ Oakland
without setting foot in the Book
Center. However, the Book Center
obviously carries all texts required
for Pitt courses and at least
provides “one-stop shopping."

BY GEORGENE KALEINA .

It's a lousy, dismal night in
Oakland. You ﬁnally drag yourself
out of the library, unlock your car
and...and your car won't start. lt’s
raining and you don’t .feel like
trudging to the nearest gas station.
.-You don’t know hide nor hair about
cars.

Well, there is one way to avoid
such hassles right here—the
Leisure.Learn Center’s do—it-
yourself method. .Novice Auto
Mechanics.

The Leisure Learn Center offers
a 10-week course for $12. How
many times has a gas station tried
to charge you $40 to‘ change your
spark plugs? Maybe there_wasn’t
anything wrong with them, but
since you aren’t well-versed on
auto mechanics, who are you to
say? You might save yourself one
of those outrageous gas-station
bills by doing it yourself.

As Susan Kaye, enrolled in the
course last term, said, “You learn
how to tell if what the service
station says is wrong with your car
is the truth. You’re taught what to
look for.” .

Cars aren’t the only area in
which you can acquire some
expertise through the Leisure
Learn Center. A host of classes is
being offered this term for students
lost for" something to do in their
spare time. After all, you can
spend only so much time in the
bars or afthe movies.

Have you ever sat at a concert
envious of the guitarist?

For a beginner ‘unwilling to spend
$4 a half hour, that’s not bad.

A class in ceramics and pottery is
also offered for $15 (materials
included). At the Pittsburgh Arts
and Crafts Center, you’d pay about
$62 for a 12-week course.

The Leisure Learn Center has
ﬁnally made its way to Pitt. You
might as well try it out. Other
courses are modern and folk

dancing. Again, over at the Arts”

and Crafts Center, you’ll pay $35
for 12 modern dance classes, while
at Pitt you’ll pay $10. According to
Assistant’ Director of Activities
Jack Brown, in many cases, some
of the same instructors from the
Arts and Crafts Center teach in the
Leisure Learn Center."

The courses offered through the.

Center are _introductor_y for the

most part but, if they work out,"

Well, ‘
there's a basic guitar class for $10. '

  Learning at
A Reasonable Price

additional advanced courses may‘
be offered later.

The concept of the Center started
at Pitt three years ago with free
knitting, macrame and crochet
classes in the Towers. The turnout
for these classes was so big that the
Student Union Board (SUB) wrote
to Indiana University of Pennsyl- ‘
vania concerning the whole concept
of leisure learning. Indiana has
had a similar program for about '12
years. The Center has turned into
a full-scale operation at Pitt‘

ofﬁce. .

“We want the Center to
eventually pay for itself but not by
placing the classes out of reach of
the student,” Brown said. There is
a strong emphasis to keep the’
course fees nominal, he added. The
present program is subsidized by
the SUB. ‘

Because it’s a developmental
program for students, the Center’s
coordinators are open to sugges-
tions. A survey has been sent out
to help‘ the coordinators project
what kind of courses should be
offered, at what time and for
whom. _

Right now, the Center doesn’t

through the Student Activitic-;~,“_'.-K;

have a home within the Universityffs‘

Student Activities is requesting use
of the space behind Uncle Charlie's
in the basement of the.Student
Union. If the Ofﬁce of Space and
Planning agrees, plans to set up a
permanent home for the’ Leisure
Learn Center will start.‘

“We want to design a place
where students can go to learn
bridge or billiards if they want,”
Brown said. “It should be a center
where you can see something, do
something or get a new idea.”

The ofﬁce, as Whippet calls his
two-room business apartment, is a
dingy living room and kitchen, with
a shoebox-sized bathroom off to the
side. The twentieth coat of
Landlord Green is peeling off the
walls. Black lines run across the
wooden ﬂoor where dirt has been
ground into cracks‘, and, when you
walk, there is a crunch-crunch of
cookie crumbs and marijuana seeds
nobody bothers to sweep up.

The furnishings ﬁt the rest of the

brown stuffed chair with a
telephone on one of its flat arms.
Over the sofa is a picture ripped out

only three people to see. It has
been almost two weeks since the

calls, each more or less the same.
His manner is abrupt, even terse,
when he talks.

“I'm at the crib.._.how many you
want? Uh-huh...not_on the phone
man, wait till you get here. Don’t

While he talks he is walking around
the room. scratching himself,

nine or ten people he feels he can

Theater X Focuses on Human Fears

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The seventh offering of the
99-cent ﬂoating theatre this year
was the return of Theatre X, a

...g group who last year converted

7"?»

‘ /’ Stephen Foster Memorial into the

guts of a rotted cathedral in the
slums of Boston, armed with
nothing but music and several
ﬂashlights. 4

Theatre X has become involved
in terror, horror and fear over the
last year—their first production in
this line
Unnamed," a story of the destruc-

tion of the humanmind when con--

fronted with the powers that lurk

behind the shields of complacent U ,

everyday living.

Razorblades, the latest produc-
tion continues the exploration of
human terror on other planes, once

again examining the everyday for I

5 the underlying sacraments that
 ,...r‘often do not bear seeing.

u"
,/
.. /,
:1. .1

\
x\"i

 

Unlike their earlier production, ‘

Razorblades uses -more props,
more people and a wider range of
demands both on the actors and the
audience. Theatre X has managed
to salvage their tendency to work
with bare minimums, focusing the
attention on ‘the action, the
movement and the ideas of the
presentation. .

Whether: for lack of money or
common sense, Theatre X keeps
props to a minimum, and the result
is a delightful exploration of what

       
  
 

simply called The’,

fear means to people. Not-onlythe

fear of the mystical or. the
unexplanable, but the fear of the
cold toilet seat, the raging mother
and subconscious desires. -

The play explodes into a seriesof
vignettes, scenes and images, each
one self-sustaining and probably
containing more than enough
material for an entire production on
its own. Thus we are given a
whirlwind‘ tour of our society, the

inside of our heads and the inside
of our fantasies, most of it
uncomfortable.

The audience is taken from

childhood fears of toilet training to»

fears of underarm odor, from fears
of incest to fears of death,‘from
fears of sexual impotency to fears
of failure, on and on with only the
sudden blackness on stage between
the scenes.

Because of the‘ exploratory
nature of the play and because of
the immense georgraphy of human
emotion Theatre X‘ attempts to

i maintained by

cover, the play builds up a
centrifugal force, as if all of the
images and thoughts and actors are
about to be ﬂung off the stage and
into space.

The cohesion of the action is not
some theatrical
mummery; there is ' no sly or
mathematically calculated rhythm
to connect the scenes. The things
that binds the pieces of this play

\ __ <_i':
I . I. .' - ,
. .~-‘‘\

(«"3

  
 

together are the bounds between
the audience and the actors—por-
traying their fears, live, under the
lights, in real flesh. The real
cohesiveness that allows Theatre X
to balance on the edge of anarchy is
simply our ownlattachments to our
fears, and to the actors who can
make those fears come out from
under our beds.

Theatre X has perhaps taken one a
great weight in this subject, for the
range and power of fear is the
actual cement which makes our
society work. Whether it is the fear

  

of being an outcast or the fear of
punishment, the emotion of fear is t

the energy that maintains the

taboo, rituals, ethics and standards

that create a stable civilization.

In Razorblades, the play began
as the actors studied the sharp
edges ‘of the barber’s blade,
turning it, watching it glint in the
stage lights. The play ends with the
actors using the same mysterious
edges to cut apples, andoto shave
faces, andbelly-buttons. The thing
of mystery becomes a tool, perhaps

" ~ ‘bereft of its excitement, maybe
boring or prosaic, butno longer an
instrument of" terror or. reason, for ._

ﬂight. .

. Throughout ‘the play we are l
invited to examine our fears, to

- laugh atiour ‘latent ‘homosexuality,’

. to attempt suicide,‘ to watch an ‘

incestuous rape, to be.impotent, to
be stupid, to be lazy, to be ridiculed
and to fai_l. In the end, we can use
all of that to cut apples into
managable slices. -

It is a simple allusion simply

done, like that of a fairy tale told by

the Grimm Brothers. It is a story of
death, corruption and murder‘.
Razorblades is an education, a
fable and a revelation. To say

anything more is to bury goodness '

under rhetoric a-nd to succumb to
the fear that something, some-
where, cannot -be easily defined,
boxed and put away in, the attic.

To escape our fears we only have
todancev with a vampire, or invite
the shadows_to step forward into
the torchlight.

by forward Mimi Senkowski, a 5-7

Wallace was all smiles at the end

“I was pleased with everyone,”
she said, “although Ithink we need
a little more rebounding overall.
There are still a few weak spots

Pitt News A A

BY JIM SPAN OS

Like the handsome guy whose

blind date turns out to- be a
disaster, the 10-year old boy who
comes down with the measles the
day after the beginning of summer
vacation, and the housewife who
burns dinner, the Pitt Panthers‘
haven't had much about which to
cheer this year. -
‘ Sure, the new year began with
impressive victories over Buffalo
and West Virginia, but in the
latter, senior co-captain Tom
Richards severely injured an ankle,
and just how long,he’ll be sidelined
has still not been determined.

Nothing vanishes as rapidly as a
dream, and Pitt Head Coach Tim
Grgurich is discovering just how
quickly a vision can dissolve. On
Saturday, the Panthers lost a
hard-fought contest, 75-74, in triple
overtime, this time against a good
George" Washington squad.

With Bob Shrewsbur.y replacing
Richards in the starting lineup, the
Panthers actually outplayed GW
throughout the game, and.though
they trailed at the half, 41-40, the
scrappy Panthers had led most of

. the half. '

-In the first half, Larry Harris,
who finished the game with a
team-high 26 points, scored 12, and
freshman Pete Strickland and
senior Willie Kellytallied eight
apiece to keep the game close.’

In the ﬁnal analysis, however,
the inability of Pitt to contain 6-3
guard Pat Tallent,, whose brother

’-Bob is the George Washington,_

coach, was a major factor.- When
the Colonials" needed a basket, they
looked to Tallent, who finished with
31 points. _

The lead changed hands contin-
ually in thesecond stanza, and at
the end of regulation time, the
score -was tied at 60. A . .

During the first overtime period,
Kelly hit a 16-footer to‘ put the
Panthers ahead, 62-60, but GW’s
Les Anderson hit a reverse layup at

the 2:38 mark to tie the game. Penn ’

Hills graduate Kevin Hall missed
two foul shots a minute later,_and

.a one-arid-one to send the game
into Overtime II. .
In the second ﬁve-minute exten-
sion,r?Pitt’s Scott Nedrow made a
three-point play after John Hol-_

laran sank two -free throws. With
l:l6 to go. Tallent stole the ball
from Harris. was fouled, an_d made
both shots to put GW up, 66-65..
Harris later hit the second of two
ree throws to send the igameuinto
Overtime IlI.- _ _ '- .
Harris scored the Panthers‘ first

Notre Dame in scoring in each of
the nine games played thus far,
and the only defeats the men from

Indiana have suffered have been 

UCLA, Indiana and Kentucky.
Last year, Pitt ‘stunned Notre
Dame, 84-77, in overtime, and
went on to win nine of its next ten
games. '
_ Whether or not Pitt will use a
Notre Dame win as a'springboard
for the rest of the season remains to

.be seen, of course, but certain

patterns are beginning to show.

The most important of these is
the average margin of defeat for
the Panthers. This year, Pitt has
lost eight games by average of less
than ﬁve points per game. .

A Swimmers 

Still Unbeaten

BY JIM LEWIS

The Pittiswimming team broke

an old tradition Saturday.

And the swimmers are very

proud they did.

Bucknell University had domi-
nated the Panthers longer th_an
anyone cares to remember.

Until this year, that is.

The Panthers, with the help of
Jerry DeMuro’s three wins, blasted
the baffled‘ Bisons, 84-29, and

ended Bucknell’s six-year domina- '

tion.

The score was never close. Pitt.
won 11 of the 13 events and took‘

second places in 10 to totally
dominate the meet. ~ 8

But Head Coach Dick Bradshaw,
despite his team’s crushing victory,

still has lots of respect for Bucknell.-

“They’ve always had one‘ of the
best teams in the East and_ do again
this year,” Bradsh_aw said.

‘ That’s true; Bucknell has won
the Atlantic Coast Conference title
for the past two years, but

compared to the Panthers, the

Bisons looked extinct. _
Jerry DeMuro took three big.

We all know there is no such

thing as a one-man team, yet the

term is always thrown around when
one player excels. Examples—‘—O.J.
Simpson and the Buffalo Bills,
Bobby Orr and the Boston Bruins,

and Tony Dorsett and the Pitt .

football team. .
Many people: who follow‘ Pitt
hockey have been saying the same

thing about ,_Rick Vernon and the
Panther skaters. After all, what do

you say about a fellow who scores

 an averageof three goals per

game? .

But thePitt Hockey Club is not a
one-man team (Vernon will be. the
first to tell you that) as it showed in
an 11-2 thrashing of Duquesne at
the Civic Arena Saturday.

Though Vernon got his usual
three goals and freshman Dave
Carns surprised everyone by
gathering four, it was a team effort
all the way. ' . -

“I couldn’t believe our passing,_”
Carns said, lauding his teammates,
“Everyone . kept setting me up
perfectly. and I couldn't miss.”

Defenseman Bob Arturo started

The whole team was in full bloom

‘as the Panthers out-skated, out-

checked, and- out-shot (50-9)

game. But by matching Pitt’s
hard-hitting, fast skating type of

(who, along with Catinchi, Bill
Wagner and Dennis Harrington,
won-the 400-yard medley relay) and
the diving duo of Dave Reeder and

Tom Fatyol.

Tracksters on Right Foot  

BY JIM GEFSKY

Once upon a time. indoor track
was just a prep session for outdoor
and cross country. But things
change, and so has the status of
indoortrack.

- “Indoor track used to be merely
a training session, but gradually
took on a greater signiﬁcance,”
said Coach Mike Agostinella. “Pitt
had been in the Eastern Confer-
ence, which still didn’t stress
indoor track.

“This year, however, Pitt joined

the Central Collegiate Conference.

This is a conference of midwest
schools, and because of their colder
climates, they place a great deal of
emphasis on A indoor track.
Conseauentlv. so will Pitt.”

The debut of this “new-look”
indoor track team came in the Gulf
Classic at the West Penn Track
Club. Against Bucknell, Mt. Union
and Mt. St. Mary’s, Pitt had Nick
Martin, Dave McDonald and Mark
Studnicki, who placed third, fourth
and’ sixth respectivelyin the mile.
Don Goodyear finished second and
Keith Taylor third in the high
jump, while Dan Maydak wound up
fourth with a 22.3 long jump.

Pitt’s brightest note came when
Mel Boyd won the 5,000-meters,
Agostinella was naturally pleased
with the ﬁrst match.

‘‘It was a good start. Since in
track a runner’s time peaks at the
end of the season, right before the
NCAA tournament, I would con-
sider this first- match like an
exhibition game in baseball.

I thought we were making good
progress in our training and
practices. This match apparently
confirmed that thought._”

In looking ahead to the rest of the

season, Pitt has good reason for’
optimism. Only two runners have ’

graduated, while a 48-man team
thatincludes Karl Farmer. Mike

Matter, Willie Walker, Mel Boyd,
Dan Goodyear, Nick Martin, Rick
Markley, Keith Taylor, Don May-
dak, Dave McDonald and Mark

Studnicki -returns. ,

The actual size of the team is still
a question mark because of an

NCAA ruling limiting the visiting
team to 22 players. Agostinella
would prefer 28 players for a

14-event match to avoid having the _

sprinters prepare for double or
triple events.

The NCAA is presently meeting
on this issue, so the possibility of a
larger team still exists. 1

“This team has a lot of potential.
Their actual match experience is
somewhat limited,‘ but I have every

reason to believe that they'll
improve'with each match. The
talent is no doubt present,”

Agostinella said.

Their limited experience does
include some cross country. Indoor
track’s distances are. somewhat
longer than cross country's. But
cross country is sometimes an
indicator of indoor track. If that
proves true, it would be quite a
plus, for Pitt went 3-0 in both
individual meets . and invitations,
and finished 24th nationally.

The indoor track team’s next
encounter will be a triangular
match with West Virginia and West
Liberty at the Field House on
Saturday. Agostinella is not taking
that match lightly.

“West Virginia has a ﬁne team
that features Alex Kassius, a
cross-country All-American. West
Liberty has several 9.6 100s and it
would be a big bonus for them if
they could beat one or two large
universities in a single meet,” he
said. '

The big match of the year is the
Pitt Invitational on Jan. 30-31. The
Invitational will feature 23 schools,
foremost’ among them Maryland
and Seton Hall. This match could
well be Pitt’s chance to achieve
national recognition in indoor

' track.

Yes, things can change for the
better. The “new” indoor track
program has shown signs that it
will do a lotmore this year than just
go around in circles. ‘

. NIXON FOCUSES oN BOOK.

SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP)
—~Former President Richard Nixon
‘has decided to concentrate on
“working on the book” rather than
enter the political arena during this
presidential election year, say
fellow members of the Lincoln Club
of Orange County. '

“I got the_impression that Nixon
probably felt it was wrong to get
involved in politics at this time,”

said Robert Beaver, treasurer of"

the conservative club which has
long supported Nixon."

Coalson Morris, club president,
said the former chief executive told
the group recently that “he
planned to spend 1976 working on
the book.”

Tankers Wind
  . Against
Cleveland  

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette swimming team
won a 10-5 victory over Cleveland
State Saturday afternoon.

Jamie Conley and Kathy Stetler
each took first place in two events.
Conley won the 200-yard butterfly
and the 500-yard freestyle. Stetler
took top honors in .the 200-yard
freestyle and the 50-yard butterfly.

' Pitt also took ﬁrst in the
following individual events: indiv-
idual medley-—Jennifer Price; 50-
yard breast stroke—Angie Lopez;

50-yard freestyle—Connie Elston. 

The Pantherette team of Elston,
Price, Lopez and Nila De Jesus won
the 400-yard medley relay, and Pitt
divers Connie Hiester and Jennifer
Brooker finished first and second
respectively in the P one- and
three-meter diving.

“We had some good swim-
ming," Pantherette Head Coach
Kate Mathison said. “The kids
looked good in the 2003; they
started out smooth with good
strokes. All our swimmers did a
good job.”

“Cleveland State had a few good
swimmers, but they lacked depth.”

Before the season, Mathison
cited depth as the major weakness

of the Pitt team. Now, it appears $8,

less of a problem.‘

“This meet gave the. kids a lot of
experience and a chance to see how
they feel in each race,” Mathison

V said. “I think we’re ready for Penn

State."
