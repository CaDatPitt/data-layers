joining the medical staﬁf of the Amer-
ican University of Buiret. He sailed
with his family September 11. “Jack”

promised letters concerning» our trav-
els and work. We left New York on
September 11, on the S. S. Braga, of
Faber line (French), our kit and bag-
gage, all household effects and auto-
mobile on board. -

The sailing was smooth all the way
and consequently we suffered no sea-
sickness. Stops and shortvisits were
made at Providence, R. I.; the Azore
islands; Lisbon, Portugal; Jappa, and
we landed in Beirut on October~2, one
weekiago this morning. I’m sure the
stop at Jappa was the most interest-
ing asit was our ﬁrst, real glimpse

 

’ of\the people of the near east.

.To see them unloading freight (one
touring car slid into the sea and to
thebottom and was rescued next day
by naked divers in plain view of all
the ship's passengers) into ancient
boats manned by red-fezzed, -baggy
trousered (Shrine_rs will please note),
moslems, were sights never to be for-'
gotten. Some of the laborers were
only the fez, or-tarbush, as it is called
here. The night ride up along the
coast to Beirut last Sunday was inter-
esting, as the lighthouses of Mt. Car-
mel, Tyre, lSlld0I1,‘al1d other old bib-
lical cities were all seen.

We were met by Sister Jean and
herhusband-, Dr. F. Smith, who are
stationed 100 miles north of here, and
a number of the university men. Ex-'
perienced no difﬁcultles with the cus-
toms oflicers as far as baggage was

concerned,» but the auto and house-’

was put on the ticket.‘ Well when
election came off all these other boys

for ’-help-—butI did mine myself. When
I goes’ to vote, one bird says to me
to vote for him and for somebody else
for .some other oﬁice and I turned
round and I says I guess you don’t
know who I am--and I told him,and
he says I was —a good joke and he
laughed and I said his bunch wasn’t
square the way they tried toget votes
from the fellows. He says he guessed
the student senate knew by this time
how to run an election onlythere ’s
one rule I says they never made and
he says what's that I says theyshould
make rule that there should be no
electioneering within an inch of the
ballot box.‘ And so I guess that shut
him up because I didn’t7 see him after
that but you know that is why I
couldn’t ‘get an ‘oﬁice. » A

We had a big pep meeting and a
parade before the W. &.J. gameand
so I wish you would send me anew
hat and a,WoverAcoat as my head

the excitement but AI guess it ‘was

worth it for we made those fellows A

look‘ cheap.

\ I ain’t had a good muealfor an awful 5

long-time and so I’ll beftickled pink
when‘ I ‘get home Thanksgivin’ and

You know I didn't say much about.
Philly last letter but I meant totell
you that it» was a lot bigger than
Pittsburgh only the pAeoplerthere ain’t
near as high class as they all live in
houses like everybody’s elses house
and there ain’t no originality. I ‘rode
in one of them Subway things which
are underground some times and up
in the air the rest of the time. Where
they ever got the name of calling that
placefthe city of brotherly love I don’t
know for I was in four ﬁghts.

Well this is“ about all until next

-"Beat Penn ,.State!

 

‘st-:voNo HUMAN ENDURANCE

 

All endurance records appear to
have -been shattered by the. Michigan
student of recent newspaper fame.
Not content with carrying. sixteen
hours of university work, he a.ttempt-
ed the stupendous task of putting
himself through school by "working
twelve hours every night. He wanted
an education and he is wi_AllinAgA to sac-"‘
riﬁce his health for it. i ‘ 

A will as strong as this could rule
the world but for one thing, the frail-
ty of the human body. Muscles and
nerves -cannot stand as unrelenting a
pace as this without giving, away.

‘ 'l‘here are many other students who
are -‘attempting the same thing, think-A
ing they are exceptional in their
strength and endurance. To be sure
many of them are not motivated by
the -same desire, but the fact remains
that -they spend anywhere from 15 "to

quently this mania for work ﬁnds. ex-
pression in campus activities. When
this is the case the activity ceases to‘
be an integral part of their educa-
tion and becomes a positive menace
to their well being- ' .

Thehuman body is} not the unbreak-
able 'tool that ‘many people would
make it.» It demands consideration,
and if that consideration is steadfast-
ly refused it will cease to" function
properly. When that time comes life
becomes a task. ' "' AA

“mu KNIJW ME, llllll”
mus hour runinu

Chalmers Hall, Mines ’13, of Port-
land, Oregon, the well known writer

of “You Know Me, Al,” letters, has
‘sent the secretary another one relat-
ing to his proposed trip to the Stan-
ford game and also his feelings when
he heard the W. & J. score. We
llchalii
thinks that Stanford ‘ will be easy
picking for Pitt, but with ‘A‘Andy”
Kerr and Thornhill on the job, “Pop”
Warner’ cannot afford to take any
chances.‘ The Pitt team will be out

other game. HerAe’s “Chal’s” letter:
"Friend Karl:   » .
A Well I seen byAthe ‘weakley’ that
you got my last letter .about the Pitt'-
Stanford game‘ and as deserved give
the letters lot of advertising among
the students, etc. As you dident

that you either got me some or dident
get me any in which case I will half
to buy some so you can put in my
order for 8‘ instead 4. as originally
asked for. I, my sister and her hus-
band, 2 parents are going and probly
Bob Forman his Mr's and mother will
be on deck to. see the slaughter,
whitch is 8. . .

I send the clipping from the weak-
ley‘ to my sister in Frisco believing
it would be a little hint to ask me
to occupy one of the 4 guest rooms
of which they was bragging but to
date I got no reply so I sippose they
are sore acct what I said about them
and you published it. ‘So you see you
probly got me in wrong with them; It
is too bad you had to Asacriﬁze me in
order to use my letter and boost your
paper. You might of "signed the letter
Bill or something instead Al so that
they would notof knew about who
was ment. . ' - _

Well‘ I was down at Medford last
Sat and hung around the newspaper
office all ‘day in order to get W-J score.
Finely thescore at the end of the 3
quarter come. in showing Pitt 19 W-
& J 0 and I fell over onthe floor: and
got all dirty but I dident give a dam
about that as the porter at the hotel
would loan me his brush to clean of
witl1._ Well I know that when Pitt had
a_ lead ‘of .19 they would be able to
hold off any 2 teams that could be
recruited this side of atlantic city for
the,ﬁ1_1_el quarter if they was "all on
the ﬁeld at once andthey did as I
seen by the ﬁnel score. '

Well tsltate dont look so dangerous
now“ and Stanfordvis a total less so,
the season is sucessful. .1 dont see
any need of Pitt coming out_to Frisco

ence in the middel of the ﬁeld and an-
nounce to the crowd that Pitt was
better by 25' points and the. crowd
.would go home satisﬁed which would

‘the hospitals out of a lot of meat then
the" jack could be split between the.
ball park and the home for ball headed‘
men and everything would be ﬁne. .
«Well I must close as. I got to run

ence with some magnates, etc.‘ Tell
Harry Greb I will be gladto see him‘
when he comes to Portland soon.-

I=oR THE MAIL BAG

Dear Editor: - »

_On behalf of a numberof Freshmen,
wewish to reply to the notice of the
Sophs ‘in a former edition of the Week-
ly. "We beg to -differ with them on
.'sever_al matters.‘ In the first place,
-the majority of the. Freshman class
are abiding by the rules. There are
only a, few Frosh who are making
fools"of themselves and theirclass by

c trying to buck up against the Fresh-

man regulations. However, in regard
to some of the alleged violations,‘ how
-can we Freshmen be expected to obey
the rules ’when the upper classmen
disagree as to just what these rules
are? As an instance of this: A-tithe
beginning of the semester, ‘we were
-forbidden the use of the Bridge of
Sighs. Later, this restriction was ‘re-
moved, but in the last edition of the
Weekly it was again included -among
the list of Freshman regulations. How
are we to know what the rules are?
Again, ‘the rules say nothing‘ about
the wearing of jewelry, nor do they
forbid -black silk socks. Yet some.up-
'-per-classmen persist in niakingboth
taboo,‘ We repeat, we are willing to
oabcy the rules when the-‘Siophs will
get ‘together and decide just what
these. rules are. One or two Sophs
should. not be allowed to make their
ownrules. Such actions reﬂect un-

‘and. spirit. . .

‘turned out, and urges all women stu-
dents to come out equally strong for

SMIIKER   ‘FESTIVAL

.

 

The Pitt Engineering Association’
had a very successful smoker in Alum-
ni Hall, Friday evening, there being
a ﬁne’ turnout of students, alumni and
faculty members. In fact, almost 100
per cent of the student body of Dean
Bishop’s School was out to smoke, eat
and enjoy the fun._ Fred Henrici,
'05, was. chairman of the committee on
arrangements and acted as master of.
ceremonies, the other members of the
committee being C. L. Wooldridge
’97, W. D. ,Hockensmith "01, Harry
Reizenstein ’10, C. W. Ridinger ’93’,
Prof. H. ‘E. Dyche, C. ‘L. Henry ’23,
J. W. Hal1ock,.__’12, and K. E. Davis ’10,’

One of the big features of the pro-
gram was a 13010 match on “kiddie
cars” between the teamsirepresenting
the mechanical and electrical depart-
ments. W. .L. Ryman captained the
mochanicals and A.-C. Stambaugh the
electricals. “Pie” Williams, varsity
footballend, acted as referee ant af-
ter the teams had -"battled for two hec-
tic sessions the matchwas decided a
draw. The two teams’ played in the
hallway of Alumni Hall, the players
being mounted on kiddie cars and be-
ing provided with .wooden mallets,
with which they attempted to. knock
an elusive indoor" baseball past the-
defense. The spectators, crowded
around the battle ground and. ran
grave risks of having their shins
cracked by the vicious polbists in
their wild swings.‘ '1 - 

The mechanical team in additionpto‘
Captain Ryman, consisted of M. S.
Jacobs, Raymond Little, A. T. Bohren
and A. W..‘Zetl1. _, Jacobs, who is
plunger on the swimming team, and
who weighs somewhere between 2509
and 300 pounds, proved to be a star
goal. tender, his bulky form « taking
up almost the entire space of the hall-
way. Captain Stambach’s ‘electrical
team was made up of C. M. Ralph,
P. O. Longguth,,W. M. Connell and J.

WHY Go To COLLEGE '

 

1 Students offer‘ ai-large variety of
reasons as to why they are spending
four yea__i's of their youth,’ the most

gated from the outside world of men
and affairs. College need not mean
segregation, but it often does.

Somevattend in order to escape four
years of labor, others that they may

culture. All rthese, with the excep-
tion of the ﬁr.'st_,‘are _praiseworthy ob-
-jects of » endeavor, but all “could be
obtained without four years of non-
productive labor. Men can. increase
the value of their serfuices without
Reading widely

forrnation ..tha.t will give him therap-
pearance of a" cultured man, for’ the

to talk on _a wide variety "of topics,
such as art, politics and religion."

5-Too‘ few stirdents pay attention to‘
the development of their own per-
sonality by" contact with other men
of ability in ‘particular lines of en-
deavor. ‘ In‘ the development of per-
sonality. the college is in its own‘ pe-
culiar sphere. No correspondence
course, no reading; no social ambition
of the individual can take the, place of
tlievcollege with its corps of special-
-ists in every line of endeavor. With‘
theassimilation of knowledge under
the guidance‘ of an able’ faculty the

an _outlook- that cannot be‘ imparted
through the pages of a book. Since

‘most easily gained... inside the walls
of a‘ college, the student.,sho“n‘1d put
forth his most serious efforts in that
direction, proﬁtiiig through both his
afrienrls and instructors.———Temple Uni-
versity .Weekly. 4

HARRlERS‘ swear‘   
ALLEGHENY MEET

 

In the last run of the season the
Panther Harriers made aclean sweep
of the ﬁrstﬁve places in their cross-
country ra.ce with .A1leghen_y College.
‘The team score was 15 to 313. 

The_,meet‘ was held Saturday over
the Schenley Park course starting and
ending at the foot of‘Flag Staff hill‘.
opposite Carnegie Tech.‘ The ground
was hard and covered with an inch
and a half of snow,’ and this coupled
with a strong Wind and-falling snow
made the running exceedingly diffi-
cult, especially to the visiting runners
who were rnot equipped with s_piked
shoes.  - ‘

Corbett,'the Pitt star, was the ﬁrst
.runner to ﬁnish, completing the long
"grind of 4%. milesin the ﬁne time
of 25 minutes, 23 seconds.“ '
 At the crack of the gun, Corbett
took the lead which ‘he steadily in-
creased to the end, ﬁnishing about 200
yards "ahead of Ec. I-lays, the second
Pitt man to ﬁnish. Wadkins,‘ the
third Panther gave I-Iays ‘a hard ﬁght
for‘ second place and was forced out
by ‘only a few yards. Close on the
heels of VVadkins came Schroedel and
White, who completed the Pitt score,
as ‘only ﬁve men countin the ﬁnal
team score. L  ~ _

._~B1iss, the ﬁrst Allegheny man to
ﬁnish, crossed the line in sixth place,
about .30 yards behind White. Fol-
lowing came ' his teammate, Little.
Brook Riley of Pitt, was eighth, fol-
lowed by Homer, Beyer, and Borgor-
das, all'o_f Allegheny, who ﬁnished in
the order flamed. Shaffer of Pitt and
I-Iartzell of Allegheny brought up the
rear. ' . t _ Z .

The cross-coLuntry team does not
lose‘ a man through’ graduation and
the-. outlook for a good ‘team. next year
‘is very bright. The Frosh class has
‘a numberof promising men_who will
beweligible’ next year and _who will
strengthen the s_qu.a_d greatly. “

Meetings

 

The football team will play its last.
home game of the year tomorrow at-
ternoon ‘at Forbes Field, where the
Pennrstate eleven will be met in their‘
annual Thanksgiving Day clash‘. Af-
ter tomorrow the Panthers “will have

Concerning the importance of this

, game with State, little need be» said,

for everyone knows the signiﬁcance
and importance of all Pitt-Penn State,
games. The game here in Pittsburgh
every Tlianltsgiving-Day is always the
-biggest game, of the day throughout
the country. L‘ _ .- _ A "g '
Many Pittites will witness tomor-
row’Ls struggle in‘the hope that Pitt
.m;ight score against the Nittany Lions
after ‘a period of three years, during
which Penn State’s goalline has been
uncrosrsed by" a Pitt eleven. Few
present‘ students in the .University
were enrolled here the last time Pitt

defeated or scored against «State, that -

time being during the S. A. T. C. year
in 1918. That year and each year be-
fore that as far back as _1914, Pitt
managed to win from State by large
scores. But since 1918, Pitt has not
been able to score ag'ainstLState. How-
ever," -State did not win all three
games sincel~1918, for the last two

games between tlle‘Center Countians ' '

and the Panthers have ended in score-
less] ties: ' ' ‘ ’ ' .
In 1919 Penn ‘State won from Pitt
20-'0, when the Bezdekians executed a
play very 1-‘rarely seen or even at-
tempted, the throwing of a forward
pass from behind their own goal line.
The forward pass was so_Well planned
and it surprised Pitt so greatly, that

it enabled, Penn ‘Stateto score a. __

touchdown, after Higgins caught the
ball and ran 90 yards with it. Before
that forward pass was thrown, Pitt
had carried the pigskin. to Penn-
State’s one-yard, only to ‘lose it on
downs. After Penn State scored the
touchdown, they played super-human
football and won 20-0, andearned the
right to be classed -as the Eastern
Champions in football. _ .

Since that defeat Penn State an
Pitt have met twice and on each oc-
casion Statewas the heavy"favorite.
On eachtoccasion Pitt outplayed Penn
State, but was forced to be content
with a scoreless tie.

This year Pennstate is not the fa-
vorite, but this fact is going to make
tomorrow’s game more diﬂicult than

I either of the‘ last two games with

State, Penn State considers Pitt its
biggest rival and willhesitate at noth-
ing to beat her. Not even the fact
that their-only’victol'y over a Class
A team was a 10-0 win over- Carnegie
Tech is .suﬁicient to causethe Lions
_to believe that they ‘are inferior to
the Panthers. A '

Even if the records of the-tW.0 teams

are ‘compared which is by no means a A

reliable ‘method of ,L comparing two‘

teams, especially in"the case of. such . ‘ I
