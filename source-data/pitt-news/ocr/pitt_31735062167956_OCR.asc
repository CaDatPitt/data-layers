 Inflation plagues nearly every
5-‘conceivable aspect of modern so-
if-iciety, and parking is no less af-
f fected. As the amount of unoccu-

' counts for hikes in meter rates.

 timeothey allow. These increases
Tare gradual, and they are influ-
’ enced by demand for pa rk i ng
~ f -spaces in a particular area, the
., kind of people that use such facil-

_l vities, and the number of hours the
C  average person parks.

V When an area is first inspected,
 parking there is free of charge. As
-‘ ; time progresses, however, and
— many motorists leave their cars
 in thisrarea, meters are instituted.
‘This is done to insure «that others
have access to parking spaces as
well, rather than having one per-
1 Ion occupy a space for a whole
.day. '
_ This was precisely the problem
. in Oakland before parking meters
‘ were installed. At one time, work-
ers would take advantage of free
i.  "parking spaces. while students.
V . "arriving too late to park near the
ll University, were forced to walk
 several blocks. Since the install-
' ’ " ’_ment of meters, however. parking
V time is more equally distributed.

ments are determined also by the

the day. In shopping districts. on
the other hand, rates are higher.
and parking time is shorter. since
few people ever park for much
more than an hour in these areas.

  

    
  
   
   

, However, on-the-street parking
 creates difficulties. At certain

on other occasions, a car parked

Borrowing Limit

by ELEANOR ADAMETS
Staff News Writer

HARRISBURG, February 11—The heads of Pennsylvania’s
three state-related universities urged the passage of the full ap-
propriations requested by their schools. Hope faded that their
appeals might spur rapid enactment of long overdue tax legislation as
legislators continued to hassle over the type of tax program needed to

Secure Il€C€SS8I‘y I'€V€llU€S.

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar expressed along with Chancellor

Paul D. Anderson, Temple University_, and President Eric W. Walker.

Penn State University, the gravity of the financial crisis existing at

each school due to the failure of
the State Legislature to appropri-
ate expected operating funds.

“The limitation of our borrow-
ing capacity can only carry us to
late May or early June," Posvar
said. “When we reach the end of
our borrowing power,’ we will
have reached the end of our rope."

All three school executives ex-
pressed the fear that deteriora-
tion of morale among both the stu-
dent body and faculty, as well as
the undermining of the Universi-
ties’ image of stability could cause
damage that would take five or
ten years to remedy.

The University executives met
briefly with Governor Raymond
P. Shafer, who advised them not
to give up all hope and to keep
pressuring the Legislaturefor ac-
tion. H

House Speaker Herbert Fine-
man, Philadelphia Democrat, bit-
terly criticized Governor Shafer‘s
lack of legislative leadership and
charged that the Governor simply
listened politely to the Chancel-
lors‘ ‘ftale of woe.“

“Governor Shafer sits back and
watches these exercises in futility
instead of offering a voice of lead-
ership,” Fineman stated.

House Majority Leader K. Le-
roy Irvis, Pittsburgh Democrat,
expressed his belief that the Chan-
cellors' visit and statements were
beneficial since the effect was to
dramatize the crisis that exists in
the schools.

Upon his return to the Universi-
ty, Chancellor Posvar stated that
he believed the Harrisburg trip
was beneficial because direct
communication had been estab-
lished with the Legislature. He
stressed that although no imme-
diate results were evident from
the trip, the importance of the
Chancellors‘ effort was to im-
press upon the State Legislature
the extreme seriousness of the fi-
nancial situation at the three
schools.

Senate Budget Policies Commit-

INFORMATION REPORT ON
THE CURRENT FINANCIAL
AFFAIRS OF THE
UNIVERSITY IN RELATION
TO THE SENATE

BACKGROUND

The University of Pittsburgh.
as a “state-related university.”
requests an allocation from the
State Department of Education
which, after such modifications
as they consider necessary, trans-
mits a suggested budget to the
Office of Administration which
in turn makes a recommenda-
tion to the Governor. The Uni-
versity has currently requested
$41 million. And the present re-
commendation of the Governor is
$38.4 million. The corrected for-
mula recommendation of the De-
partment of Education is $38.5
million. The amount finally
awarded is determined by the
legislature subject to approval
by the Governor who may di-
minish., but not increase. the
amount of the award.

The State Budget is divided
into preferred appropriations go-
ing to those institutions. agen-
cies and departments directly
under its control and non-pre-
ferred budgets going to instru-
mentalities operating under their
own jurisdiction. Pitt is in the
latter category. The total budget
at present under discussion by
the legislature is approximately
$2.5 billion. which is roughly
$450 million in excess of the pro-
jected tax income. Of this $450
million. It is anticipated that
approximately $250 million will
be secured from the recently ap-
proved business taxes leaving a
gap of about $200 million. The
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Association Agency. from which
scholarship and student loan
money is derived. has already
been funded from the $250 mil-
lion business tax levy to the ex-
tent of $51 million.

PRESENT:

The University has received
during the current fiscal year,
no State money for its general

Monday,iFebruairy 16, l070—THE PITT NEWS—-Page 5

 

operating budget for the reason
that no appropriations have been
passed by the legislature. In
consequence of this the Univer-
sity has been forced. in order to
meet its payroll and other obli-
gations. to borrow roughly $20
million. The interest charges on
this amount to nearly $5.000 per
day. If the legislative impasse
is not resolved, this borrowing
must continue since both major
periods of tuition receipts have
already passed.

It is probable that our total
indebtedness on this account
alone at the end of the year will
be $40 million, provided that this
sum can be borrowed. Two fac-
tors must be considered. First,
there are statutory limits to the
amount that any bank may lend
to any one borrower; second, it
must be pointed out that the Un-
iversity has of itself no credit
and is borrowing against its im-
mediate expectations from the
State. a collateral that some
bankers might regard as dubious.
The pending appropriation bills
do not make provisions for re-
imbursing interest charges paid
by the University under these
circumstances.

FUTURE:

The total estimated interest
charges that will have to be

-met, if the legislative impasse

continues, will amount to about
one million by the end of the
present fiscal year. It is obvious
that this sum will have to come
from current budgets, from anti-
cipated but no longer realizable
expansions, and from potential
new programs. It might, in fact,
come to a point where the Uni-
versity would be unable to
continue its present rate of ex-
penditure and possible that it
might not even be able to con-
tinue any expenditures at all.

It will be seen that, before
any n_on-preferred budget can be
approved, approximately $200
million must be raised by new
taxes. Four sources of this mon-
ey are at present under consid-
eration. First, a tax on utility
properties. Second a tax on un-
incorporated business, by which
is meant not only the corner
grocer and the barber shop but
also physicians-, lawyers and
other professional men. Third,- a
tax on royalties, rents, interests,
dividends and capital gains.
fourth, a broad-based
tax with which, it has been sug-

Tuition Increase Or Shutdown?

By ELEANOR ADAMETS
Staff News Writer

Chancellor Posvar reports that
no official decisions have yet
been made by the Administra-
tion concerning a tuition in-
crease or possible shut-down of
the University as a consequence
of the current financial crisis.
The Chancellor indicated that
these decisions. as well as oth-
ers such as the possible elimina-
tion of summer session. may
have to be made within the
"near future" unless the expect-
ed appropriation from the State
Legislature is received by the
University. -

If the State Legislators do not
find a method to secure suffi-
cient revenue to fund University
operating expenditures for fis-

. cal year 1969 very soon. the Uni-.

versity faces the prospect of rais-

ing tuition to as high as $2.000
per year or be forced to “sus-
pend opening" until such funds
are appropriated.

The Chancellor attributed the
cause of legislative inaction to
what he termed a "political par-
adox".

“A tiny nominal majority
exists in each house of the legis-
lature, which means that both
houses lack a clear majority to
go in any direction or command
a firm caucus,” he explained.
“In Harrisburg, both parties are
fragmented and perhaps 10-20
per cent of the Legislators won't
follow a party vote on any given
issue. “Without a firm caucus,
where a majority of Legislators
would vote the position of their
party, it is extremely difficult
to pass any bill.”

Chancellor Posvar pointed out
tha-t in Pennsylvania, unlike the
situation in California. most Leg-
islators are not hostile toward aid
to higher education.

“It is incorrect to consider
the Legislature as an abstract
and say that they are not do-
ing their jobs. Individual Legis-
lators in both parties are work-
ing very hard to remedy the sit-
uation." the Chancellor said.

The Chancellor also stated
that the state-related status of
the University is part of the
current funding problem. The
fourteen state colleges in Penn-
sylvania are completely state-
owned and have received pre-
ferred appropriations out of the
original $2 billion budget. The
three state-related universities

must be separately funded from
other sources since they are not‘
wholly state controlled.

..Chancellor Posvar stressed the
need for the University to re-
ceive the full amount of its ap-
propriation when it finally is
awarded.

"It's absolutely too late in the
year for economizing. on our
budget. Our monies are already
committed and there is no way
on this earth for us to econo-
mize a current year's budget
without bankruptcy or ruin,”
the Chancellor said.

The Chancellor indicated that
he felt a letter-writing campaign
is probably the best way for stu-
dents and their parents to inform
their legislators of the kind of
taxation legislation they prefer.

income .

  
   

gested, be included tax reforms,
such as a reduction of the sales
tax and a restructuring of occu-
pational taxes.

Which of these measures will
be passed depends almost en-
tirely on the reaction of the vot-
ers since all repesentatives and
a half of the senators will run
for election this year.

It must be emphasized that
any action taken by the faculty
as such would be both ineffec-
tive and unwise. Pennsylvania
legislators are friendly to educa-
tion and would be generous, if
only the people would allow
them to be. An indivudual facul-
ty member as a citizen, if he
wishes to assist the resolution of
the present impasse, should write
to his representative stating
clearly which form of tax he
‘would himself prefer to pay, and
assuring him that he is willing
to convince his friends and
neighbors that a legislator vot-
ing for such a tax should be the
one to be re-elected.

HARRISBURG, Feb. 11 — The
State Senate today voted down ap-
propriations totaling $276,300,-
000, including partial funds for
the hard-pressed state-related uni-
versities.

The voting closely followed par-
ty lines, and reflected a partisan
dispute over how the revenues
from higher business taxes should
be allocated. The Republican ma-
jority, which sought to pass the ap-
propriations, wants to grant frac-
tional amounts of the appropria-
tions recommended by Governor
Raymond P. Shafer in his general
budget. The GOP was unable to
muster the strength to pass the
bills without Democratic help.

As the bills were being defeat-
ed, the heads of the three state-
related schools were meeting with
Shafer to discuss their plights.
The Universities — Pennstate,
Pitt, and Temple — have been bor-
rowing funds with the interest
running at $15,000 per day for the
three of them, due to the failureof
the State Legislature to enact
their appropriations.

Following the meeting with the
Governor, Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var of Pitt and President Eric
Walker of Penn State warned that
their schools were meeting the
end of their borrowing capacities.

Both Posvar and Walker said
their institutions could not func-
tion fully beyond May without ad-
ditional state funds, and both
stressed that it was too late to ad-
just their budgets to account for
any reduction in their recom-
mended appropriations.

Among the major bills defeated
in the Senate were three appro-
priations totaling $106,400,000
for the three schools. The total is
75 per cent of the educational bud-
get request.

How Our State Legislators See It

Election Year

by BOB GIN G
Staff Writer

In a recent interview with
Thomas F. Lamb, The Pitt News
questioned the state senator on
the financial crises which the Uni-

‘versity is now experiencing. One
reason for the impasse in the State
Legislature, according to Senator
Lamb, was that their is a funda-
mental disagreement as to the
type of tax which is needed in or-
der to come up with the required
money.

“There are some people in the
Senate, and probably in the House
too, and I think it’s fair to say that
most of these people are Republi-
cans, who feel that there should
be no additional tax whatsoever,
that the budget should be cut. If
this happens, of course, the Uni-
versity would only get a fraction
of the appropriation that it re-
quested. There are others like my-
self who feel that we have an ob-
ligation to fund the full amount,
and if this requires additional tax-
es, we ought to do it."

When asked by The Pitt News if
one of the reasons for the alloca-
tions and related legislation being
held up, was the fact that this is
an election year, the Senator re-
plied, “There is no question that
in an election year it is difficult to
pass taxes, and especially con-
sumer taxes." Lamb went on to
say that the fact that 1970 is an
election year is one of the prime
reasons for the lack of action
which is being exhibited in Har-
risburg.

When asked whether this policy
might backfire, and give the leg-
islature the appearance of do-noth-
ing body, Senator Lamb pointed

Senator Sesler

Of W Rep Plan

by MIKE EDELSTEIN
Staff Writer

A Republican plan to fund State
Universities at 75 per cent was
soundly criticized by Erie Senator
William Sesler in an interview
with the Pitt News Feb. 11 at the
ADA dinner in the William Penn
Hotel. Sesler charged that such
action would be “totally unfair in
light of the legislature’s commit-
ments.

The Democratic caucaus secre-
tary also criticized an Assembly
plan to fund 50 per cent now and
50 per cent next year as being
“probably illegal (to impose such
commitments on a new legisla-
ture). a strain on next year's bud-
get and a threat in that another
donnybrook might then occur."

Sesler said that Senate Demo-
crats where pushing to have the
“sloppy” House Bill 1417, which
calls for taxes on the property of
public utilities, discharged from
committee. The Senate then can
take the initiative in improving
the bill which could raise $470 mil-
lion, thus providing sorely needed
funds for long-overdue allocations.

 

  Lamb Explains Lack

out, that this was the image that
the State Legislature already had,
but he also explained that there
were some men who realized that
they had an obligation to live up to
the accepted mandate such as
making Pitt a state-related Uni-
versity. “We in effect said to the
University, ‘I will make you state-
related and will fund you substan-
tially.’ Unfortunately, there is a
large group in the legislature who
don't feel any particular obliga-
tion in this way.”

Lamb continued to point out that
there is some hostility in Harris-
burg toward the subsidies which
are now granted to the University
and that many Representatives
feel that the students should be
forced to pay more of their edu-
cational expenses. Senator Lamb
disagreed with this type of think-
ing, however.

the University, Penn State and’

Temple, for the most part, stay
in Pennsylvania, and take upon

Republican John P. (Jack) Murtha of the 72nd District (Johns-
town area) said that "as the election gets closer, it gets more and
more difficult to get votes for.:a tax." Elected in a special election
just last May. Murtha, likes his constituents in the Assembly, faces
a primary election this May. The general election is slated for No-
vember. '

But the Assembly‘s newest member stated, “It's not only a mat-
ter of political courage, but of frustration-not knowing which way
to turn. Everyone needs money, but no one wants to pass a tax to
raise the money.

“The most frustrating thing," Murtha continued, “is that there
isn't enough staff in the committees to get the work done. While the
state employs 110,000 people, the Legislature has only 500 people
working for it, and they cannot monitor a $21/2 million budget._"

“I fear it may not be settled until after the primaries,” Murtha
added. “I just‘don’t know where the money will come from. All the
tax plans have little chance of passage. The alternative is to cutback
programs, which would hurt Pitt. Besides it’s hard to do this after
six months of spending.”

Unable to offer an immediate solution, Murtha looks for neces-
sary changes to prevent a replay of the present fiscal fallacies. “We
must anticipate revenue needed to appropriate money. We should
have had the budget for next year back in November, but a realistic
appraisal can't be made until the present problems are solved. Then
the burden will be on the small staff."

In addition, Murtha called for full-time legislators, comment-
ing, “State Representatives are paid only $7,200 a year and work an
average of two days a week. A day is spent in caucaus and another in
committee meetings and voting. The rest of the time IS suppose to

It's a very short sighted approach
to thwart educational opportun-

When asked his feelings con-
cerning the economic effects of a
University shutdown, the Senator
explained, “I don't think that the
legislature as a whole is con-
vinced that we are anywhere near
that point, where, the University
would be forced to shut down. I

Governor Blamed

“The Governor and the Legislature share the failure to raise
and allocate money," explained Allegheny County Commissioner

“The Governor has exerted no pressure on his party. Not one
Republican will co-sponsor the income tax bill," noted ‘the former
legislator before last Wednesdays ADA dinner. “This is a disgrace-
ful situation," he continued. “I voted to make Pitt a state institution.
Now we're reneging. It's the worst performance I’ve ever seen—a
game of musical chairs to see who gets blamed for passing taxes.”

Fineman Responds

To Penn State’s Letter-Writing Campaign

(Editor's Note: The following response
rom Speaker of the House of Representatives
erbert Fineman originally appeared in Penn-
ylvania State University's The Daily Collegi-
n, February 6, I970.) ,

The following is a letter from the Speak-

' er of the House of Representatives Herbert
g Fineman in response to the many letters he
 has received urging that the University's ap-
 propriation bills be passed.

Fineman, a Democrat, listed three areas

 in which Democratic attemps to raise mon-
 ey were blocked by Republicans.

The letter reads:

May I respond. through the columns of
The Daily Collegian, to those who have writ-
ten me personally or sent clippings of -“An
Open Letter to the Pennsylvania General As-
sembly" in regard to the fiscal impasse
which has proved so detrimental not only to
Penn State and other educational institutions
but to the entire Commonwealth.

First, I must emphasize that I am as dis-

I-tressed as you are over a situation which

need not have arisen in the beginning and
should never have been permitted to reach
the point it has. It is costly to state institu-
tions like Penn State and to the students and
their families; it is unnecessary and uncon-
scionable.

But I do not think it is fair or enlightening

 to scapegoat the entire Legislature for this
E situation. It is not, for example. accurate to

ay that “the Legislature has . . . forced the
Pennsylvania State University to borrow
money at a current daily interest rate of
6,000, compounded daily.“

Conceding as I do that the Legislature is

555%: not without flaw, and conceding as I also do .

that all the saints are not in the Democratic
Party and all the sinners in the Republican
Party, let me call attention to certain facts
which should be considered in assessing the
responsibility for the situation.

It is , in the first place, an obvious fact
that the Commonwealth cannot provide serv-
ices without the money to pay for them. This
means, for the current fiscal year, about
$450-$500 million in new revenues.

Now the fact is that the House Demo-
crats, last October did pass measures which
(with the addition of the subsequently pass-
ed increase on cigarettes) would raise the
necessary funds.

The fact is further that these measures
were passed over the monolithic opposition
of the House,Republicans (with a single dis-
senter who refused to follow his party line ).

The fact is that. last February, the House
Republican Party took a‘ party position on a
“hold the line" budget and held to their line
for many long months, insisting on the floor
and in the press that Pennsylvania could
limp along in the current fiscal year on the
previous year's budget, notwithstanding the
simple fact of inflation and the legislative
enactments for which they themselves had
voted and did vote.

The fact is that when they finally surren-
dered their "hold the line" political position
—blandly admitting. incidentally that it had
been a partisan stance throughout—they still

‘refused to accept the House Democratic fis-

cal program or to propose any viable alter-
native of their own.

The fact is that after the House sent its
fiscal program to the Senate, that body. con-
trolled by the Republicans. took no action
for several additional weeks.

Then—after proposing such regressive
tax schemes as an extension of the six per
cent sales tax to clothing, medical expenses
and other necessities and a 10 percent sur-
charge on utility bills, to be paid entirely by
the ordinary consumer—the Senate Republi-
cans agreed just before Christmas to accept
part of the Democratic fiscal program. But
only in part; they left the state underfunded
for the current fiscal year by at least $200
million, and it is estimated that we will be
underfunded in the next fiscal year by an-
other $500 million.

I believe that the Democratic Party has
met its responsibilities to provide revenues
for education, welfare, environmental im-
provement and the other vital State Govern-
ment programs. I know that I have personal-
ly met with the leadership of the other party
on at least 30 separate occasions, making
plain our willingness to consider any propos-
al they might suggest but preferring, of
course, that taxation be levied in accordance
with the principle of ability to pay.

We shall continue to meet our responsi-
bilities, but I think it important to under-
stand two things.

One is_that the friends of education are
not just those who talk about providing ap-
propriations but those who are willing to put
their votes on the line for taxes.

The second is that the Democrats, who
have put their votes on the line for taxes,
are in a majority—and a slim one, at that-
in only one chamber, and that with the lack
of leadership from the Executive Branch
and the lack of cooperation from the other
party we are not in a position to do the entire
job alone.

 How Our News Reporters See It

 Soon As Possible

 

Adoption Of State Income Tax Favored

By ELEANOR ADAMETS
Staff News Writer

State Senate Republicans failed to
muster enough Democratic support last
week to push through Senate Bill 1255.
The bill would have provided that the
tﬁee state-related universities receive
75': of their appropriations now from
available funds, along with a legisla-
tive “resolution of intent” to provide
the additional 25‘; of their appropria-
tion as soon as revenue should be-
come available from future tax legis-
lation. But legislators supporting full
appropriations for the universities may
still have to fight stopgap “piecemeal”
legislation.

Shortly before that Bill came up
for vote in the Senate, House Speaker
Herbert Fineman, D—Philadelphia, ex-
plained to me why he would bitterly
oppose any piecemeal programs.

...“It would be catastrophic to pass
laws giving only a portion of the uni-
versities’ expected appropriations,” the

aker said. “This would provide a.

erfect out for legislators who are anx-
ious to get back home to campaign for
re-election, and still not have provided
a solution to Pennsylvania’s tax prob-
lem.”

Speaker Fineman said he believes
the way to solve the Universities’ ap-
is to pass an
equitably structured income tax at 3
per cent with a $1,500 exemption for
,each dependent. Coupledwith such an
income tax would be reform measures
designed to lower the rate of the
Pennsylvania Sales Tax, which now
stands at 6 per cent and is ranked high-
gt in the nation.

 

After talking to other Legislators
and considering the other tax package
options, I tend to agree with Speaker
Fineman’s analysis. The real danger
seems to lie with a legislative “reso-
lution of intent” to provide the remain-
ing percentage after a tax bill is pass-
ed.

If tax legislation is not passed un-
til after the November elections, a leg-
islature composed of many new mem-
bers, who might quite conceivably re-
place current Legislators due to the
dissatisfaction of many Pennsylvania
voters with legislative inaction, might
not feel that such a committment is
binding. Seventy-five per cent or some
other percentage figure might even-
tually end up as the total appropriation.

Chancellor Posvar, along with -the
executive heads of the other two state-
related universities, appealed personal-
ly to legislative leaders for a full ap-
propriation as soon as possible. These
men are well aware of the inherent
dangers of temporary piecemeal legis-
lation, no matter how attractive re-
ceiving even a portion of their appro-
priations now may seem.

Full appropriations for the univer-
sities as soon as possible, without stop-
gap measures now and more legisla-
tive promises for the future, are nec-
essary and vital. The state income
tax proposal seems to be the best way
to secure revenue for these and other
appropriations since only the income

tax would provide for lower income"

bracket exemptions, as well as lower
the State Sales tax.

Key drawbacks of the other three
tax options have convinced me that
passage of the state income tax is the
only equitable solution to the tax di-
lemma. A tax on Utilities would tax
rich and poor indiscriminately, as well
as result in a probable rate increase
for utility service.

A tax on unincorporated business
would stradle small businesses like the
local barber and beauty salon operator
with taxes in addition to those already
paid by them in many localities. Small
businesses would have to suffer more
taxes in order to tap the income of pro-
fessional men like physicians and at-
torneys sihce it is unconstitutional to
single out a distinct group for special
taxation purposes. '

The final option, a tax on Unearned
Income, Dividends, Rents, Interests
and Capital Gains would effect many
aged persons who have worked to save
money for their retirement years by
taxing the interest of their savings.

No one of the tax options, includ-
ing the state income tax, is going to
completely solve Pennsylvania’s tax
problems. However, the income tax
would provide for a steady source of
income and entail fewer inequities than
the other tax options.

House Majority Leader K. Leroy Ir-
vis, D-Pittsburgh, has favored the en-
actment of a state income tax for some
time now, and has led House opposi-
tion to temporary “piecemeal” legis-
lation.

State Senator Ernest Kline, D-Beav-
er Falls, also favors the passage of the
incometax and is leading opposition in

the State Senate to any attempt to give
the universities less than the full
amount of their appropriations.

Vice-Chancellor of Finance Edison
Montgomery, stated that he personally
favors the state income tax, although
his preference, he stressed, is strictly
personal and does not reflect in any
way a university position of support for
a state income tax. The Vice-Chancell-
or said he supported the income tax be-
cause he believes the continual in-
crease of business taxes could bring ec-
onomic ruin to Pennsylvania.

As a student vitally concerned with
the future of the University, as a Penn-
sylvania voter, and as a state resident,
I support the adoption of a state in-
come tax knowing full well that such
action means that I will pay a propor-
tionally larger share of state taxes as
my income increases in future years.

That prospect does not especially
please me. But, I would rather pay
more taxes, as I am able in the future,
than face the possible repetition in
future years of the legislative debauch-
ery now going on in the state capital.
Such ineptness threatens to disrupt, and
perhaps seriously damage not only the
state-related universities but many oth-
er state institutions.

The passage of a state income tax
as soon as possible to avoid the possi-
ble dangers of temporary “piecemeal”
legislation by nervous politicians and
to insure a steady source of revenue
in the future for the State seems the
only viable solution to the current leg-
islative fiasco in Harrisburg.

The impasse in the State Leg-
islature has opened two very real,
and rather apocalyptic paths to
the University's future. The first,
is the fact that the University
could very’well shut down, come
June. and the other, which is
ﬁnally pessimistic, is the fact
that if Pitt remains open, tuition
could be raised so high as to put
the University out of reach of a
good majority of the students who
are currently in attendance.

The problem in Harrisburg.
though is not just should we or
shouldn't we give Pitt money. The
Pennsylvania State Legislators
are divided as to how they should
raise the money to fund the Uni-
versity and other programs; that
is. what tax do they initiate. It

that time of the year when all good
politicians begin to wonder if they
will be back to the state capital
next year.

Well people, it’s you and I
who will make that decision, and
not those ever-able politicians.
What is going on right now, is
that the men who we have chos-
en to represent us are sitting in
Harrisburg, playing political
games, that are not only endang-
ering the future of our educa-
tion, but are also threatening the
jobs of thousands of University
employees, and the welfare of
many people whose livings de-

munity.

As the second largest employ-
er in the city and the largest
where women are concerned, the
University, if shut down, would
leave thousands jobless and their
families in need. Since Pitt is
non-unionized due to the “non-
profit making" status of the
school, the out-of-work employ
ees could not collect union bene-
fits in their unemployment.

bers directly affected would in-
clude the more than 6,600 listed

The fallacy in this type of think-
ing is that sooner or later, a tax
bill mustbe passed, whether be-
fore or after the November (im-
agine if they wait that long) el-
ections, if the state is to keep
operating. No matter who we
elect, we are going to get the
tax, and yet, we are content to
sit by and watch in agony, as
hundreds of thousands of people
have their livelihood threatened
by a group of self-centered, un-
representative representatives.

Since we know that we are go-
ing to get a tax, one way or an-
other, even if our legislators

deny it, we should force them,
through letters, calls, telegrams,
and any other means at our, dis-
posal, to pass an appropriate bill
now. Each day we wait, the Un-
iversity must borrow more, and

these numbers by family res-
ponsibilities and a staggering
amount of people would suffer
economically from a Univer-
sity shutdown.

Indirectly hit would be the
business interests and landlords
of the Oakland-Shadyside area
whose sole staple

apartment dwellings and other
student catering services would
inevitably be run out of opera-

bers of unemployed would reach
sky-high proportions.

increases.

But now, the question be-.
comes, what kind of a tax should
be imposed. A number of taxes
are now being considered, but
the many lobbyists in the capi-
tal are using there influence for
the tax that will hurt their inter-
est group the least.

A Utility Tax has been propos-
ed, but you and I know that if
it were to go into effect, the
utility companies would pass it
right on to the consumer, who,
as you and I know, is you and
I. An across-the-board Consumer
Tax has also been proposed, but
that is just as bad as the Utili-
ty Tax.

Another tax proposal, and the
most logical, if one sets aside his
traditional fear of taxes, is the
state income tax. Wait, don't

stitutions, maintained in whole
or part by University funds and
personnel, would fold or face

with the Falk Clinic that pro-
vides inexpensive medical care
to University and community re-

tions.

passed, it is based on income,
and, income varies. The income
tax is probably the fairest tax to
be proposed, because it hits
those who can afford it, and is
easier on the poorer people, than
would be any kind of a consum-
er tax. ’

But the problem is still the
same, we must force our legisla-
tors to act, immediately, and not
after the May primaries or No-
vember elections. Let your Rep-
resentatives know how you feel,
and do it now, because each day,
our tuition goes up a little more.

 Shutdown Serious Threat To Community

Senate President Jack Matthews

One of the most widely discuss-
ed items on campus lately has
been the possibility of a drastic
tuition increases as suggested by
University Chancellor Wesley
Posvar last week in a letter to stu-
dents. parents. and alumni.

According to a Pitt News sur-
vey taken over a wide cross-sec-
tion of students. the range of opin-
ion ran from “my father is the
vice-president of Dravo Corpora-
tion” to “I simply couldn‘t afford
to stay in school.”

Greg Spridik, sophomore politi-
cal science major, said. "I'd work
until the new lottery was out, and
if my number was low. I'd go to
the University of Toronto. As for
marching to Harrisburg. it prob-
ably wouldn't do any good, but it
would be better than sitting here.

“It just goes to show how inef-
fective our state government is
and how our Governor can’t com-
promise with or even persuade the
legislature,” he complained,
“Back in December when Pitt’s
money bill was to be voted on, only
seven members showed up. But
when it came to declaring Penn
State the number one team in the
country, everyone was there to

Earl Jones, freshman English
major, said, "If there is a tuition
hike. it will force me out of school
and I'd hate to leave because
there’s some really beautiful peo-
ple here. If there's a hike. it will
mean they will have to go also.

"I have a feeling that my legis-
later is almost totally deaf, dumb,
and blind because of the fact that
he’s so divorced from anything the
people want to say to him, and I
don't think writing would do any
good." he went on.

Kerry Greene, junior French
major, commented, “It doesn‘t
affect me since I'm from out of
state. It couldn‘t go much higher
for us. I sympathize with those
who couldn't go because of a tui-
tion raise but out-of-staters
shouldn't have to pay any more
money since it isn't their states
school. I wouldn't go on a march
or write anyone because this is
an in—state fight."

Rich McDonough, senior philo-
sophy major. shouted. “My plans

tariat revolution!" McDonough
then said. seriously. "It's just
about time that this kind of stuff

ploited for purely political or eco-
nomic ends.

“I fill out a form in the Student
Union. People are under the im-
pression that this is a representa-
tive democracy." he added.

ing student. frowned and said. “I _

couldn't come unless I got a super
raise in financial aid. I'd prob-
ably go to West Virginia Univer-
sity or a nurse's training school. I
would definitely participate in a
march if one were organized. That
is what we need. and everybody
should do that."

On the other hand, another nurs-
ing student, Lynnie Dunn, said
"I'd have to go here since I’m in

to transfer. I'd definitely march
and give the legislature trouble
and even collect petitions.

“It’s ridiculous for them to sit
and do nothing. They have an obli-
gation to give at least partial sup-
port. Besides, California has free
education, and in a country such
as ours, there is almost no excuse
for everyone not having it. Legis-
lators can raise their salaries, but
how come they can’t take the time
to give money to a state-related
school?” questioned Miss Dunn.

John Wilborn, sophomore Eng-
lish major, joked, "I have a track
scholarship, and if they take that
‘away. I'd transfer to Susquehan-
na or some little place where I
could be a superstar."

Danny Maclntyre, junior politi-
cal science major. sarcastically
said. "I'll be forced to quit unless
I get a scholarship. I'll go to Flor-
ida where the weather's nice. I
seriously think a march is a good
idea, and I was thinking of inquir-
ing if there was one." _

Nancy Cluss, freshman elemen-
tary education major. pointed out,
“Since my dad has the money
and Pitt is a good school, where
else would I go? I don't think I'd
consider another school unless tui-
tion got too high and certain
courses had to be shut down and
the University had to stop expand-
ing due to lack of money."

Bill Newman, freshman math
major. said. "I have scholarship.
and it would depend on whether
they would raise my scholarship

along with tuition, which would be
doubtful. I could probably work it
out, but it would be tough; my par-
ents would have to pay a lot more.
If I’d found out about it earlier, I
would have applied to other
schools, maybe Boston University
and tried to get aid there."

suming that. if the tuition were
raised that high, there would be
little scholarship money. I'would
simply have to go out and get loans
and contribute a maximum of
money that I've earned. I've pre-
pared 'a little bit. so I guess I'm in
a little more favored position than
people who never figured on this."

On considering other schools,
Van Horn added, “If it was a mat-
ter of tuition and caused a mass
exodus, I’d probably get the hell
out of here too.”

way.

Myra Werrin, junior history ma-
jor. asserted, “It wouldn't affect
me since I didn't come here be-
cause it was state-related. I'd be
very unhappy if an increase came
about, anyone would be. The only
thing is, the University would
drastically change since a lot of
kids would drop out. Since it does-
n't affect me closely enough, I hon-
estly don't think I'd go on a march.
However, my parents have writ-
ten some congressman or sena-
tor."

George Schroeder, sophomore

art major, questioned, "Politici-
ans are trying to bridge the gen-
eration gap? How can they possi-
bly expect to win our trust if they
won't even allocate for educa-
tion? What's the sense of having a
state-related University if tuition
is raised? I would never be able
to go here is it were raised to $1,-
000."

Mark Pastin, senior philosophy
major. commented. “I think it
makes clear the order of priorities
of our legislature. It is most im-
portant that tuition doesn't go up
and things proceed as they are. I
don't think a march on Harrisburg
would do any good. The most im-
portant consequence is that we'll
lose many of our senior faculty
and this place slowly will turn into
a high school."

It is interesting to note that
many of the students polled will
be able to vote in the next election.

-port of the University for such
issues as the Black Construction
Coalition and the 1199 labor
dispute could make an impor-
tant dent because of the school's
involvement with them in a poli-
tical and economic sense.

The University began the year
with a number of community 
tion projects that are heading in
a strong direction for social
change. One example is the New
Professionals program which giv-
es to people, who would not oth-
erwise have the funds and the
time, the opportunity to earn a
college degree.

If these and other programs of
their genre were to be aborted
in mid stream, the chance of im-
mediate recovery would probab-
ly be dim.

As it is, grad assistanceshi s
have already been cut back -
the trend is to curtail signifi-
cantly special programs who
would drain needed funds from
the University budget. What this
means in specifics is that special
seminar type classes will have to
be cutback or discontinued to
provide teachers for the benefit
of larger classes.

And what about the educa-
tional innovations that the facul-
ty is toying with, and in many
cases formalizing.? Because of
the leadership of the University
in academic matters, it is ex-
pected that these innovations,
ie., nongrading systems, com-
munity involvement accredi .-
tion, etc. would filter down to
the lower schools. But if the Un-
iversity can no longer support
these projects (or frighteningly,
any others), the lower schools
may persist in their mediocrity.

The effects of a University
shutdown are so widespread that
they cannot be adequately sum-
marized in the space of a news-
paper column. a lenghthy re-
port would be more enlighten-
ing. But even a brief consider-
ation of the obvious. demonstra-
tes the immense ‘number of sou

In The Arena

By Ed Conley

Associate Sports

Editor

Casimir Myslinski, the Pitt Athletic Director,
couldn’t get into the Panther locker room at the Civic
Arena Wednesday night after the “experimental” game
against Temple, and there’s a good chance that Pitt
basketball won’t be getting into the Arena very often in
the future.

Myslinski was heading for courtside and the floor
entrance to the dressing area when one of the gendar-
mes stopped him. The A.D. argued briefly, explaining
who he was, but the reasoning was to no avail.

I was silly enough to think that the officers would
permit me (with a’ press pass on my possession) to get
into the forbidden territory.

“Nobody gets onto this floor,” I was told, even after
attempting to attract the attention of Pitt publicity man,
Dean Billick, for identification purposes. Thinking back,
I guess I was a bit rediculous to think that I could suc-
ceed where Myslinski had failed.

Anyway, the A.D. and I walked around the Arena
stands, attempting to find a solution to our delemma.
Myslinski noticed Cub Coach Tim Grgurich standing
near the floor entrance to the locker room and suggest-
ed that I quickly sneak through to the dressing area.

I did, the Myslinski never made it to his coach and
the Panther quintet.

....“They’re a professional outfit,” Myslinski said a
couple days ‘-later. “They just don’t want people to get
into the locker room. You have to be either a coach or
an owner.”

The difficulty Myslinski had attempting to reach

the locker room probably won’t affect any plans for fu-'

ture encounters in the “Big” Igloo”, but the turnout for
the game certainly could.

Two “pilots” prepare for take-of at game in the Civic Arena.

The announced attendance was 2080,’ most of whom
were students. And that’s probably not enough to excite
the Athletic Department.

....Myslinski agrees. “If it happens (a future appear-
ance in the Arena), with the number of students we
had—fine,” he said. “But I’d say the number of others
was sort of a flop.

“We had only about 2,000 people and the Arena’s
cost is too high to bring just that many people in.”

Myslinski mentioned that he still prefers to keep the
athletic events on campus, anyway.

The events might be forced to stay on campus if the
halftime antics at the Arena game are truly an indica-
tion of the behavior of Pitt students.

The fans didn’t have many opportunities to root in
the 101-72 trounce by Temple, so they decided to have

some fun.‘ Over 100 paper airplanes were tossed to the

floor, causing many of the men from the press area
and perhaps from the other sections to scoff at the Pitt
“intellectuals.” '

Billick had one of the planes land against him.
And, he (like myself) was disturbed by the riciculous
showing of our loyal band.., “That’s a real tribute to
Pitt fans,” he mentioned to Mike Miller, one of our writ-
ers.

Overall, then, the “experiment” wasn’t very suc-
cessful. At least not for anyone other than the kid who
let fly the plane which smacked Billick.

Pete Maravich, Calvin
Murphy, Rick Mount, and Au-
stin Carr weren’t in uniform

at the Field House Friday night,
and yet 235 points were totaled-

up in the Panthers‘ conquest of _,

the Syracuse Orangemen.

Like the above-mentioned col-
legiate super-scorers, the Pan-
thers’ Kent Scott, Paul O’Gorek.
Cleveland Edwards, and Mike
Paul rippled the cords in All-
-America fashion. All four start-
ers collected at least 19 points
and errored on only 18 of 54
shots from the floor.

Overall, the team’s pin-point
marksmanship (.649 field goal
percentage) might cause the
roundball fans in the nation to
glance a second or third time or
else doubt the accuracy of the
local printing press when their

eyes meet the “Pitt 127  Sy--

racuse 108" outcome in the dai-
ly sports pages.

Only twice before in this cur-
rent basketball season has any
college topped 127 points. The
defending national champions
and present number one team
in the country, UCLA, accumu-
lated 133 tallies against LSU;
and Notre Dame’s 130 total
crushed St. Peter’s of New Jer-
sey.

The 127 point outbutst crack-
ed all previous school scoring re-
cords. In 1957-58 the Cats set
the school scoring record by
trouncing Geneva, 109-74. The
235 combined total. points is also
a new Panther game record. The
Panthers and Boston College
collaborated for the previous
game-high, 202 points. ,

Coach Buzz Ridl mentioned
that he doesn't believe that any
of histeams had scored as many
points. “I think that one of my
teams might‘ve hit 124 once,
but never as high as 127. "

Ironically, the last time
the Panthers had use for a three-
digit scoreboard was against
Ridl’s alma mater in 1964-65;
the cagers crunched the West-
minster Titans, 101-71.

Syracuse’s fullcourt press, a
slackened zone defense, and 82
free throw attempts propelled
the production of points to the
new all-time total output. Ridl

PAUL O’GOREK (50) lays-up two of his 27 points in the Pan-
ther record—breaking 127-108 victory over Syracuse, Friday night.
Orange Forward, Bob McDaniel defends against the cager center.
The Syracuse press provided the Cats with plenty of opportunities

attributed the scoring explosion
mainly to the fact that his squad
could move over and through
the double-teaming Syracuse
press.

"We had a good, long work-
out concentrating on the press
last night (Thursday) against our
freshmen. We came through by
hitting the man on the side or
in the middle down court and

-then going right to the basket.

Our ability to beat the press and
also the high number of fouls
caused the high-scoring," Ridl
explained.

Obviously, the experience
against Georgia Tech, Temple,
and the Cub freshmen proved
beneficial. The Orangemen, no
doubt, thought that by duplicat-
ing the pressing defenses that
the Panthers had faced earlier
in the week, they could provide
the same critical kick in the bel-
ly which the Panthers had been
receiving.

The Orangemen were a bit
startled, however. M i d w a y
through the‘ first half the Pan-
thers had blitzed through the
Orange defense for a 26-13 lead.

Then after Paul O’Gorek (27
pts.) hit a eight foot shot from
the side, the crowd roared (ton-
gue—in-cheek), "We want a hun-
dred." At that time the cagers
led 47-27 with 3:29 remaining in
the half. In the next few minutes
the hoopsters increased their
margin by a point and led at in-
termission, 58-37.

Once the Orangemen dis-
covered that the cagers could
handle the full-court press and
would continue to work the ball
for the good shot, the Syracuse
defense became aggressive to
the point of physical roughness.

Were it not for a considerable
amount of self-restraint, two box-
ing exhibitions might have taken
place: Paul O’Gorek .vs. 6'11”
Bill Smith and Cleveland Ed-
wards vs. Ernie ‘elbows' Austin.

"We had a 25 point leadgand
they didn’t want us to hold the
ball; so thei went out to get us.

They made the ugame agfarce,

 

though. The last ten minutes
(because of the excess fouling)
lasted longer than the rest of
the game,” Assistant coach Fran
Webster stated.

The closest Syracuse could
come was 97-85 in the second
half. Immediately following the
basket which squeezed the cag-
er advantage to twelve points,
Mike Paul put the Panthers over
the century mark for the first
time in 5 years. 5

Gerry McFadden fouled Paul,
and he struck success on both
ends of the one and one free
throw. Then the Panther forward

took a third shot (a technical
foul shot) and swished the ball

through the hoop. Almost in-
stantly, the Pitt band. began
playing, and the cheering crowd
jumped to their feet.

The Panthers’ fiery, 82 per
cent second—half field goal aver-
age, Cleveland Edwards‘ 13 as-
sists and 20 points, and Kent
Scott’s 28 points kept Syracuse
far out of reach.

 

CUBSREVENGE
SARAH LOSS

The point Park freshman
squad couldn’t show up Fri-
day night for their schedul-
ed rematch against Tim Gr-

Grgurich didn’t let
Cubs rest, though. He ar-
ranged a game against the
Sarahs, a group of ex-colleg-
ians who drubbed the Cubs
earlier in the year.

Things were a little dif-
ferent this time, though. The
' Cubs led the Sarahs through-
out the encounter, and the
final score was Cubs-92,
Sarahs-88.

Shattering three school rec-
ords and two Trees Pool
marks, the Pitt mermen de-
molished the swimmers from
Youngstown. Ohio. 79-34. Saturday
at Trees Hall.

Copping 011 out of 13 events. the
tankers never let up throughout
the entire meet. According to as-
sistant coach Dick Bradshaw.
"you can go_ right down the line

and find that everyone improved

in something."

Coach Grant let the evidence
seak for itself "We tried some

   

DAVE

 
 

WESSEL, Pitt's outstanding diver, shattered two more pool recordsin

different combinations in the re-
lays and started some different
people in the individual races. Ev-
eryone was psychologically up for
the meet. We were at home and
they knew what they had to do to
win.

Grant also points out the fact
that after the first event the mer-
men had the meet pretty well sew;
ed up. With 5’ seven point‘ lead
Rick Rowe, a new entree in the

1000 yard freestyle race, set a-

new Trees Pool record with a time
of 11:09.2. Rick came back in
the 500 yard freestyle event and

the Panthers 79-34 victory over Youngstown. Dave, a junior from Pitts-
burgh, is rated among the top divers in the country and will pariticipate in
boththe Eastern and National championship meets.

Even bathing every day
can’t stop it. .

R Feminine odor starts inter-
nally, and no amount of bath-
ing can remove it. Soap and
water simply can’t reach the
area where the odor starts.

That’s the reason you need
Norforms® . . . the second deodor-
ant?” These tiny internal sup-
positories kill germs—stop odor
effectively yet safely. In fact, gen-
tle, doctor-tested Norforms are
so safe and easy to use, you can
use them as often as necessary.

No bath or shower can give
you Norforms’ protection. Get
Norforms, and you’ll feel se-
cure and odorfree for hours.

won that too. His time: 5:16.6.
The amazing part of the Rowe
story is that Rick has been sick
this past week with a very bad
cold.

David Wessel once again awed
the crowd with more spectacular
diving. Dave shattered both of his"
diving records. one from the one-
meter board and the other from
the three-meter board. Eclipsing
his old mark on the low board by
over 40 points (his old record was
249.50. yesterday he scored
290.20). and then coming back in
the high board event to record a

I point total of 317.85. Dave exhibit-

ed some of the best diving of his
young career.

Coach Grant commented. "Dave
‘is just starting to come into his
own. He‘s getting ready for the
Easterns and they'll have a tough
time keeping him out of the three-
meter event. Last year he broke
into the one-meter event and now
all he has to do is make a name for
himself. He's already ‘qualified for
the Nationals."

With records being set all after-
noon, Al Morris got his share with
alightening time of 2:32.2 in the
200 yard breast stroke event
eclipsing the old Pitt mark of
2:23.5.

In order of their appearance.
