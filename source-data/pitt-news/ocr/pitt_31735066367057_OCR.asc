“Press” Goofs on State Story;
Leaders Disclaim Article

“Tuition at the University
of Pittsburgh for full-time
students will be $450 a year
starting in September.”

“Moreover, tuition for
part-time students at Pitt
will be reduced 50 per cent.”

With these paragraphs, the
Pittsburgh Press began a story
which misled readers and which

prompted leading state legislators,

to deny emphatically the claims
made in the story. The newspa-
per report stated that a agree-
men.t had been worked out among
leaders of the Senate and House
to pass the Pitt appropriation bill
sometime this week and make
the University state-related.

However, as soon as this was
printed, State Representative Jos-
hua Eilberg, House majority lead-
er, said that the speculation that
the deadlock would break up this
week was premature. He also said
that he had no additional con-
versations with the Senate ma-
jority leadership concerning the
University legislation.

Sen. Robert Fleming, chairman

of the Senate Appropriations Com-
reported that he
knew of no new developments in
the legislative stalemate with the

mittee, also

general appropriations bill or the
Pitt bills.
Another legislative leader, Rep.

Martin Mullin, chairman ofithe
House Appropriations Commit-

tee, also knew of no new agree- .

merits and said that it will be at
least two weeks before his com-
mittee completes its version of
the general appropriations bill.

According to traditional legis-
lative procedure, no other appro-
priations bill can be considered
or passed before the general ap-
propriations bill is passed. This
bill provides funds for the run-
ning of all the executive and leg-
islative offices of the state. Gov-
ernor William Scranton, Sen.
Fleming, and other Harrisburg
leaders have urged the Senate to
break with tradition and pass
the University appropriations.

But the Senate has held with

tradition. According to Rep. Eil-

berg, “The Senate has arbitrarily

taken the position that the Pitt _'
bill will not be passed until they
get their way with the general
appropriations bill. It is part of
the pressure. We have passed the .
bill and all the Senate has to do

is pass it and the students at

Pitt will know that their tuition
will be $450 Sept. 1.

-The information for the Pitts» 7

burgh Press article came from ‘
James A. Gallagher, chairman o-f 

the House Committee on Higher"

Education. Gallagher h a d said
that Senate Majority Leader Stan-

ley G. Stroup approached Rep.

Eilberg with an offer to move

the Pitt appropriation bill today‘ 
if the House would put the $1.4 
billion general appropriations bill 1 I
into a conference committee ‘so P" I

that Republican and Democratic _
differences could be settled.

Pitt Greets Foreign Students
Through “Operation Meet”

University students will meet
newly arrived foreign -students
and take them into their homes
over Labor Day Weekend through
“Operation Meet.” The program
is aimed primarily-at American
students who plan to travel
abroad or join the Peace Corps
or YMCA Overseas Workcamp
Projects. ,

“This on-the-spot exchange of

ideas and mutual self-help will
be a great advantage in getting
to know a foreign culture through
the eyes of an international stu-
dent,” Frank Watanabe, execu-
,tive-of the Pitt YMCA, explain-
ed. The Pitt YMCA and the Of-
ﬁce of Cultural and Educational
Exchange (OCEE) instituted the
program this year.

Watanabe emphasized that even
this type of help on a short time
basis is needed because “even the

V simple act of paying a trolley or

bus fare can be confusing to an
international student.” Dr. David
Hoopes, assistant director of
OCEE feels that the international
student will gain immeasurably
from the initial contact with the
American culture through the in-
formal family situation.
“Operation Meet” will hold
brief orientations for students at
8 p.m. July 26 and August 10,
although students may arrange
other times, if necessary.
Applications are available in
212 SU and in 1101 Bruce Hall,

Are the ‘Pitt News’ 6'9’ SG Rubber Stamps?

  Forum Discusses the Right to Protest

By DAN BOOKER

Is there a right to dissent

at the University? Should
their “dirty” image bother

., campus dissenters? Are Stu-
3? dent Government and The

Pitt News “rubber stamps”
for the administration? These are
a few of the questions discussed
before a sparce audience of 30
people in a recent SU program,
“The Right to Protest in Aca-
demia.”
Though some argument arose
among the four speakers in the
, , forum-like program", none of the
5, ",,;;{.,sri_eakel*s expressed ‘disagreement
’  -: with a charge by panel member
 1 ifsi.-ink Kofsky that, to the admin-
: df,t,ion, ‘..‘diss_ent is a privilege

   
   

  

time,” continued Kofsky, a teach-
ing fellow in history.

Another member of the forum,
Robert Supansic, a senior history
major, though not disagreeing
with Kofsky, dealt with ‘fthe right
to dissent” in general and not just
ill the University community. He
said that “to refrain from dis-
sent is less than human.” He
further maintained that “dissent
is a personal matter,” which
should not meet with interfer-
ence.

What might be considered a
personal matter by dissenters was
the only thing which seemed to
arouse differing opinions, among
.the dissenters. Steve Jenkins. a
graduate student and teaching
fellow-,in' SD}?-ech, ‘began the argu-

 ".2'¥’  l-*—*_*.*.*2f..»:-...S..i?L.c..<=., - they" ‘

pus h ‘

persuade others to accept their
viewpoints, they could do a much
more effective job by destroying
their “dirty” image. Average
Americans, said Jenkins, see stu-
dent protesters as unshaven, un-
clean persons. This image must
change if campus dissenters want
to put across their point eﬁec-
tively,

But, Vic Papale, a member of
the William Pitt Debate Union
and one of the panel members,
said that, not persuasion, but
protest for its own sake is the
goal of dissenters. “If one makes
small changes for practical ad-
vantage (such as clothing), one
may also have to make ideologic-
al adjustments,” added Papale.

Kofsky said that external con-

vincing others of his views.

When Jenkins remarked that,
at a university, some central
agéncy, such as the newspaper or
radio station, should act as a ve-
hicle for dissent, Kofsky returned"
to a discussion of Pitt specifically
and declared that The Pitt News,
as well as SG, are merely tools
of the administration which do
not promote dissent. According
to Kofsky, this situation should
be “radically changed.”

Since the newspaper apparent-
l_y is not available to dissenters,
and, based on what Kofsky had
said about the administrations
hostility to dissention, Jenkins
suggested that dissenting groups
move off campus to set up their
own newspaper or some other’ or-

pganization, Kofsky answered that
‘ 12,11.-3, W‘91i1.d—b.¢: ﬁnancially impose--~'

In November, 1965, a great
transformation occurred in
Woodrow Wilson Hall at
Princeton University —
James Perkins, Ph.D., be-
came James Perkins, l\l.D.
Perkins achieved the trans-
formation by delivering a
prescription for the placidly-
pulsating system of United
States higher education. His
Stafford Little lectures had
adrenalin—like affects on the
patient. There was a sudden
palpitation as journalists and
educators praised the doc-
tor’s provocative and “un-
sparing critique” of the pa-
tient’s plight. Eight months
later the prognosis reads:
the patient has experienced
some temporary relief with
poor diffusion through the

‘system- Pulse is back to nor-

mal and the doctor’s pres-
cription has been bound into
a neat—looking 89-page vol-
ume by the Princeton Uni-
versity Press.

Dr. Perkins presents an
essentially functionalist mod-
el for analyzing the ills of
the modern University. He
dilineates the acquisition,
transmission, and applica-
tion aspects of knowledge.
which are institutionally re-
flected in the University’s
missions of research, teach-
ing, and public service, re-
spectively. Harmony among
these often divergent inter-
ests can be achieved by the
proper mixture of adminis-
tration, faculty, and student
contributions to the Univer-

sity’s internal management.

its integration in the larger
social system lies the essen-
tial variable — technology.
He mentions briefly the im-
portant relationship between
the “impact of cost and size
on the levels and focus of
decision—making” (p. 86). He
illustrates this in a two-page
account of the location of
synchrotrons.

When early work was be-
ing done on the synchrotron
low energy physics were in-
volved and the cost and size
allowed decisions to be made
at the departmental level. As
scientists moved to high-
energy physics with 10-25-
billion-electronic-volt (BEV)
sychrotrons being located,
decision-making moved to
the University and Federal

‘government levels. In the 10-

cating of a. 10-BEV sychro—
tron at Cornell, a budget de-
cision had to be made at the
White House. Perkins al-
ludes to similar movement of

decision-making “up the hi-'

erarchical scale, and away
from the educational institu-
tions toward political struc-
tures” (p. 85) as the cost
and importance of education-
al matters increase.

Dr. Perkins evades the
breadth of the problem by
systematically concluding
that universities must work
in closer collaboration to
avoid “more direct interven-
tion in university affairs by
government agencies” (1).
87). The impact of techno-
logy has already had such a
pervasive influence on edu-
cational decision-making that
the Perkins’ treatment of
the ill displays some naivite.
There are reams of journal
articles concerning the “pub-
lish or perish” dilemma of
many faculty and the impor-
tance of federal grants in
maintaining departments,
especially in the natural and
social sciences. The recent
exposure of the Central In-
telligence Agency’s Michigan
State University project in
1956 shows the high degree
of political inﬂuence already
being exercised in the aca-
demic ﬁeld.

THE INTIMATE relation-
ship between the realms of
educational professionals and
public government has been
further reported in Corrine

By Bill Cabin
Lathrop Gilb’s new book,

Hidden Hierarchies: The
Professions and Government.
Clark Kerr, in his review of
Perkins’ book, states that
“We live in a pluralistic so-
ciety with many competing
centers‘ of power.” Kerr
views Perkins’ solution as
only being able to temper,
not avoid, political inﬂuence.

THE UNIVERSITY IN-
TRANSITION by deﬁnition
does not concern itself with
the full development of such
ideas as the technology-deci-
sion—making relationship. It_
delves into a variety_ of edu-
cational problems as they ﬁt
into Dr. Perkins’ functional-
ist model. The model itself
presents many vulnerable
arguments by trying to ﬁt
the numerous, conﬂicting
problems of the modern Uni-
versity into a scheme of
harmony. The analysis is
far from a panacea, but the
Perkins prescription contains
provocative, stimulating
ideas essential to anyone in-

volved in higher education.
