The Association of Colleges in

_At the"present time, Pitt is fully
accr_edited by allsuch societies in
all its departments and branches.
Full accrediting is termed a_ "val-
uable asset to a college. It means
that its students may transfer from
school to school‘ with little loss of
credit. ,It also means’ that gradu-
B-ates" are better considered when
they apply for positions.

-_This is the day every Pitt student’ of non-legal ‘age has

a chance to make hispreferences in the presidential‘ race
knowniin the most positive way possible—by voting. Today,
from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the Commons Room, the Political
~'-Week committee, with the coperation of the downtown politi-

‘ ' cos and the Board" of Elections, has set up a. dozen polling

booths and have on hand an. ample supply of ballots which
‘duplicate those to be used in the national election‘ next Tues-
‘day. The election is a dry run, of course. The vote‘ we cast
‘will haveno effect on the outcome of the presidential cam-
paign, but that we all cast a vote is miportant, nonetheless.
, For our mock election will be «looked to as an indica-
tion of the political leanings of the coming generation of
voters, and the total vote an indication of student interest
in public affairs. We hope that the. turnout to the polls to.-

of politicking now ending. So far student response to the
idea of politics»-as expressed in Political Week has been down-
right. discouraging. Less than 300 attended the rallies of the
two parties on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Does this indicate that we who are about to take up the‘

-responsibility of government are indifferent to that respon-
sibility? Are weafraid of it? Are we -to be carbon copies

Today is Election Day at Pitt. ¢

uate students may cast their bal-

whole week of political campaign-
ing at Pitt. Rallies, which were
held Tuesday and Wednesday,
were attended by "approximately
300 persons. - ‘
Twenty—one polling booths have
been set up in the Commons Roorn,
for the balloting. Engineering stu-
dents may vote in State Hall and
harmacy juniors and seniors vote
at the School of Pharmacy.
ID Cards Needed
Identiﬁcation cards must .. be

. presented at the time of voting and

those graduate schools which do
not have ID cards will supply lists
of students’ names which will be
checked’ at the time of balloting.
In this way, it will be made cer-
tain that‘ no student votes more
than once.’ = q
The questionnaire part of the
ballot need not be ﬁlled out if the
student so chooses, but it is asked
that he do so in order that the po-
litical science department may
make its survey on why a student
votes as he does, Chairman ‘Joe
Trattner stated. - ‘

There will be cit wide public-

Players Review

 

Saroyan Play
Good, But Too

Much for Cast

By JOHN DE NINNO.

Unfortunately “The Time of
Your Life,” the Pitt Player’s
initial production for the year
now at Foster Memorial does
not live up to its title.

The play, as written by Wil-
liam Saroyon, is a difﬁcult
undertaking, and for his
“bravery” in attempting it Mr.
Harvey Pope, the,player’s director,
is to be congratulated.

However the attempt does not
make the play and Mr. Pope’s cast
does not aid the cause.

Cast Large

The cast itself is large, twenty-
six people stumbling about the
stage obviously not believing the
philosophical lines they have to
speak.

There is no deep or involved
plot to the story, or it would
seem that way since the actors
never get across the meaning of
the words they speak. The lines
are there, some of them great,
others cynical but the power or
perhaps the desire to put them
across is missing.

Laurels Handed Out ’

Some laurels, however, are to be
handed" out. Gene Miles, Chuck
Stetler and Curt Snodgrass fare
well while Anna Lou Alex hand-
ling the female lead is believable.
But Lloyd Krapp as the pianist,
more than as an actor, is superb.
To hear the music he plays and
wrote, incidently, is well worth
the price of "admission so if the
play bores you, as it did us, we
recommend you turn your atten-
tion to the background music.

Office of Panther
Staffs Changed

Both the business and advertis-
ing stat of the Panther magazine
have been temporarily moved to

sary because the Owl photogra-
pher is taking yearbook photo-

It is _our conviction that the
highly commendable spirit which
has‘ been exercised concerning
the political activity in behalf
of the ‘coming elections could be
furt7her*promo_ted in the follow-
ing manner. Students of voting
age who are registered in their“
(Altoona,
J ohnstown, Oil City, Erie) which
‘are. at a reasonably great ‘dis-

tance from the University, should-
’ be legally- excused from attend-

ing classes on Nov. 4, so that they

“ may perform their civic duty by

voting for the candidate of their
choice. I ' '

The students involved in this 4

matter would, in effect, deny ‘the
of democracy

of the University has promulgat-
> ed in its attempt to stimulate po-

litical consciousness among the,
T student body: '

_ We believe that this is a con-
structive effort ‘to further" tile

“interest of good government "and

‘should not be construed as an
adolescent attempt to gain an
authorized holiday. If the hones-
ty of the individual desiring to
exercise the franchise is so ques-
tio_ned, may we suggest he re-
ceive a veriﬁcation from one of
the oﬁicials of his election board.

parents, friends, Romans and
"countrymen. .-They brushed up
on their psychology and stated
_that there must be controls ‘on
such an experiment, and since
there could be no control, the
project would fail. Well, the dean
of men’s office devised a system
of. proper identiﬁcation for stu-
dents and their spouses and sold
ﬁfty tickets to the West Virginia
game. The game wasn’t much,
but the method worked and at
least the husbands and wives
were happy.
Faith. Hope. and Charity
W e are-called men and women.
Except when we beat Notre
Dame, we presumably ‘act like
adults. Perhaps we should be
given achance to prove we can
show a little ‘restraint. by not
abusing a guest ticket privilege,
if granted one. , ‘
I A situation like this not only
needs, but demands, intensive
study if justice is to be done for
all concerned. Granted that the
Athletic Committee is unable to
devote.the time from their reg-
ular duties to do the necessary
research, but a committee of
student leaders, ‘working under-
their supervision, could investi-'
gate .and exhaust all possible
"means and methods of installing
such a system. _
Not only would this result in-

a worthwhile project, .but the“

cooperation between students
and faculty thus required would
be a ﬁne means ‘of improving re-I
lations between the two groups.
Possibilities ' A '

This thing has possibilities. It '

deserves more than casual perusal
followed by_ an equally casual
rejection. There are many sub-
sidiary, but vital, points to be‘
run down and cleared up, and
the only way to accomplish the
task is by honest effort.
’ If this is done, we cannot voice
any valid objection or criticism;
butirwe are entitled to, and can
demand, ‘reasons and explana-
tions for ﬁnal decision on stu-
dent—sponsored requests. .

Let’s try a little of that har-
monious faculty-student cooper-
ation for which Pitt is noted.

ls -School . I .
SpnH Dead?

It has been «said, “Everybody,

sticks with a winner,” but what
about the loser? Do you kick
them, forget them, or stand by
them?

After ‘the Notre Dame victory
rally, people were saying, “Well,
Pitt’s school spirit is back.” Then
came the loss to West Virginia-—is
this spirit still at Pitt? For the
ﬁrst time in my three years. at
Pitt, I saw some demonstration of
spirit after West Virginia scored
their second touchdown and the
score read 16-0. The student body
rose in mass and gave the Pitt
squad a"well deserved hand. Was
this a last showing of spirit or
will it continue and grow through
‘the years as it should?

Pitt students and faculty will

have a chance to ﬁnd the answer ‘
to this question tonight when-the ,

team and coach Dawson will be
in attendance at the homecom-
ing pep rally on the Cathedral
lawn. This is where school spirit,
if any, will be shown. If the stu-
dent body can stick with the
team when they are down, then
‘and only then can anyone say
school spirit is back at. Pitt.

EDITORS NOTE: The Pitt News has decided» not to.
back any candidate in this year’s presidential race,
but tougive space _to individuals from both side. Dan.

  Ike Has Disappointed

it His i‘F'rs . o e
I t F ll ow rs
* By ROSS‘REESE ‘
Chairman of the Pitt’Young Democrats
Many people are beginning to think that we have
two degraded and incompetent candidates running
. for ofﬁce. But I contend that both parties did an
exceptional job in selecitng their candidates. Even
Gen. Eisenhower- is a better man than any of the
other Republican possibilities. I’m for Stevehson,
simply because I think that he would make a more
competent and more effective president.
Eisenhower has drawn a portrait of‘.hims,elf in
this campaign which has disappointed most of the
liberal and‘ independent voters who originally sup-

_ ported him. He has displayed a decided lack of

knowledge concerning domestic affairs and the
machinery of the government. "

Ignorance Na-l-ural‘ -

This is natural because Democratic government’

is difficult and complex. Only a lifetime of experi-
ence can prepare a man towbe president.‘ Up to
now, the general has only had to deal with the
iron ‘discipline of military life.

It is to be expected then, that "if a president
does not have suﬁicient experience to make" de-
cisions for himself,’ he will try to ﬁnd competent
advisors and supporters. It is in this ﬁeld that
Eisenhower has shown his greatest defects. Since
the convention, there has been a complete change
in Eiserihower’s high command. Instead of follow-
ing the advice of men like Morse, Lodge, or Duff,
he has been listening to the Words of such rela-
'tive incompetents as Arthur Summerﬁeld, Sherman
Adams, and Frank Carlson. They have urged Eisen-
however to speak in vagueggeneral terms and very
often, to compromise his opinions for" the sake of
winning a few votes.
seen ﬁt to endorse men like McCarthy, Jenner,
and Martin. - ‘ A '
‘Taken » Logical Position

v .

While Eisenhower has disagreed .with the Su-~. '

preme Court on Tideland’s Oil, Stevenson has taken
the only logical position that the _oil belongs ‘to
all the people. While in order to please Sen. Taft
"the general has. modiﬁed his position on collective
security, Gov. Stevenson has continued his support
of NATO in._Europe -and Point IV in Asia. While

Eisenhower has been shouting loudly» about cor- —

ruption,.Stevenson has very effectively cleaned up
the corruption which formerly existed in Illinois.

Displayed -Abili'l'ye

himself in this campaign. He_ has displayed a re-
markable ability to write, to’speak, and therefore
to think. He has spoken out clearly on all ofghis
issues, and he has spoken clearly in every part of
the country. _

He has frankly told powerful pressure groups
that they cannot expect any special favor K from his
administration. In a word, Stevenson has't.alked
sense to the American people. I I

In view of all this, I think it is safe to say that
Adlai Stevenson will, and by right, should be

elected the next president of the United States.-

Political Morality   -
At Lowest Point .  

- By DAN Puanv
President of the Pitt_Young Republicans

  
  

Republicans have used the phrase “It’s 

for a change” so often that to most people it has 
become meaningless. But in the light of the l_952,'[”"'

campaign, itihas more meaning than ever before. 7_,
Following the Civil War, when the Republicans,’
became corrupt through 24 years of power, it was?’

natural to give the Democrats a chance. The Demo-' 

   

crats have been in Washington foritwenty years'U'

and political morality is at its lowest point in half‘
a century. - ’

Record Bad

The record of the Truman administration is 
Since 1945 various inﬂuf-‘*-3
ence deals have implicated four members of the K15
White ,House's_taff. Fourteen high Federal ofﬁcials 

not an honorable one.

have been found using their inﬂuence indiscretely.
Nine members ofthe Administration family have 3

 

 
   

accepted valuable gifts. And President Truman. 

says, “My people are ‘honorable—-—all of _them..'’?

Shady deals’ have implicated ten Federal agenci,e§§.»_ 
and 900 employees, yet the President swears .tha-=E_' - 

there ‘is notmess in Washington. Apparently it’s

time for a change. . g 
Would Stevenson be a suitable change? He is

reputed to have cleaned up themess of a. Rep_u_bli_-

can governor in Illinois., 4‘ There is’ considerable»

doubt about the truth of this.

Would He Fire Democrats? , ,,
Even if he has cleaned up the Republican ‘mess.

U‘

in Illinois, there is no reason to believe he can i *

No, Stevenson
would represent no change. “

But would a Republican administration be any
better? Many people fear either another Teapot

‘clean up his own party in‘-Washington. It is one 
thing to rid a government of the ineﬁicient and '
 dishonest men of the opposition party, and some-
‘ thing else to ﬁre members of your .own party and
‘friends’ of your political cohorts.

Dome scandal or another depression. These fears 

are as valid as the fear of a barbarian invasion.
The Teapot Dome scandal, in spite of all its pub,-A

. licity, involved‘ only nine people, and was attended

to by a Republican administration. The depression
was more serious and deserves more consideration.-

Based On False Reasoning , .
Fear of a depression with a Republican ad-

ministration is based on some false and oversimo I '

pliﬁed reasoning. It runs, something like this:
There was a depression under ‘the Republicans and
there is prosperity under the Democrats. There-
fore we can expect a similar pattern in the future.
Carrying this false ‘reasoning to its logical conclu-
sion we can expect war fron}, the Democrats and
peace from the GOP. A 'l -

So instead ofa change to the Republican party - g
of 19.00 or 1920, voting for Eisenhower would mean‘ 
a change to the party of the 80th Congress, the 

only" congress in the past 20 years to balance the _

budget and reduce taxes. It would mean a__change= I

to the leadership of a man who is respected in in:

ternational circles, and a change away from ade. ‘ ‘

cadent party, too long in power.

‘Two weeks ago Pittsburgh held a “Gladys Sch°mitt
Week,” honoring one of .the University’s most distinguished

graduates.

Miss Schmitt, internationally known author of “David

the King,”
‘ achievements in the ﬁeld of liter-
’ ature. The celebration was timed
to launch her new book, Confessors
of the Name, which has already
been named the October selection
of the Literary Guild.

Always loyal to her alma mater,
Miss Schmitt says,” I owe a great

deal to my former teachers at Pitt,‘

Professor Percival Hunt, wh 0
taught me a tremendous‘amount
about style and concentration of
_material and" Professor Edwin L.
Peterson, who gave me, along with
a sense of structure and style, en-
couragement.” ‘
Active as Undergrad
During her undergraduate days
at Pitt, Miss Schmitt was ‘active in
Cwens and Mortar Board and was
_ also president of the Quill Club,
a‘ literary association then on cam-
‘pus.V Besides’ these activities, she
read themes for Professor ,Peter-
son and Professor Frederick P.
Mayer of the English “department.
‘_‘I made some of my best friends
at; Pitt,” she remembers. “The
man I married, Simon Goldﬁeld,
and I_ had been engaged during our
college days.” i . "
' Missschmitt, of course, majored-
in English at Pitt. “And, purely by
accident,” sheisaid» as" her deep-
colored eyes smiled behind the

dark frames 1 of her glasses, "‘I‘

picked up ‘a major in Fine Arts

too.” -
Same Weaknesses Appeared

_ “It seems to me,” she went on,’

“‘that interests in painting and

writing go together. I noticed

that the same weaknesses appeared

in both ~my pictures and my.
: Stories.” . , V . ‘
- ' bout. f the characters in her

" novels, Miss Schmitt says, “Peo-
ple often try to ‘identify my char-
acters with me. Actually my char-
acters may be anyone at all, a face

. I have seen, someone from history,
someone I know—anyone.”

[She considers her husband one

of her most acute critics. Often he _ -

helps her work out a difﬁcultscene
or checks the ﬁnal style of her sen-
tences.

“I‘think,” she stated, “that the
Iiing James version of the Bible
has deﬁnitely "inﬂuenced my Writ-
ing. Every writer, ' every child,
should be_brought up on the Bible
and Shakespeare.”

volved reading about 180 books

thousand note cards. She manages

to write between the English and
drama classes which she teaches at
Carnegie Tech.

“Playwriting,” she mentions,» “is
something I would like to try. '

But because much of herlwork
involves the stream of conscious
technique peculiar to novelists and
short story writers, she confesses
that she doesn’t think she ‘would
be very successful in that ﬁeld.

_Pitt’s freshman grid- team
will attempt - to. make it two
in-ea row tomorrow, afternoon
when they play the Navy
Plebes at Annapolis.

Coaches Steve Petro and Edgar

- Jones have made only two back‘-

ﬁeld changes in their lineup for
the single-wing minded Middies.
Dick Manson, a swifty running
back from Franklin will probably
start at right half" and Bob Grier
from Massilon is expected to open
at left half.

Until the Army game in which
the. Panther Cubs triumphed, in
their only start this year, 19-14,
Manson was‘ just another back one
the squad. -His play against the
Cadets earns for him. a starting
berth tomorrow.

The team left here yesterday
and will arrive at Annapolis to-
night. Both coaches hope that the
bus ride will not take‘ too much
out of the boys, Jones believes that

Thinly-Gods Are
Harriers. Too

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
.Sports Editor

 

Carl Olson has walked quite a distance in his time. Maybe
he hasn’t covered the trail in the fast time his cross country
and track proteges have, but then no one ever said Olson
could do everything. , ,

At the risk of learning too much, though, I concentrated
on just one of his qualities—talking—and the popular after
dinner‘ speaker did exactly that. , _=__.\._.\,‘.‘,,O,l.,,§,,.,..

I think I know now why a '“‘T“’*’4"“'g
thinclad is one and why a harrier
can’t be. But Olson explains the
situation much better than‘ I do.

“Thinclads are thinclads be-
cause they are thinly clad,” ex-
plains the Panther coach, “and
harriers get their tag because
hounds onced chased hares in the
hare-hound races that originated
in‘England many years ago.”

At this point Olson quickly crossed the ocean to inform me that
in American colleges freshmen and upperclassmen imitate hares and
hounds during initiation ceremonies.‘ Through this brief.history he
revealed how cross country pathﬁnders come by their names. They
simply picked them up from the playboys.

‘Brief’ Explanation’

“Now,” he continues,-“a harrier can be called a thinclad be-
cause he, too, is thinly clad in briefs. Never, he warns, “must a
thinclad be called a harrier.” End of explanation. ‘

I promised him faithfully that the mistake would not be re-

CLASSIFIED

[peated and went on to more important things—mainly his surprising
harriers or thinly clads (if you prefer).

Tomorrow at West Point they hope to outrun Army and Sy-
racuse. Olson has instructed his all-winning harriers to work as a
team—not to pull individually for some sort of record.

The strategy worked before and the cunning Olson ﬁgures it
may again. “Against Georgetown our boys faced the best harrier in
America, if not the world, in Charles Capazolli,” he recalls.

Watch Out for Fire

“But instead 0: sticking closely to Capazolli we concentrated
on the other key places and won?” Syracuse, NCAA title—keeper, has
that type of a performer in Ray Osterhout and Olson hopes to
duplicate the feat.

“We haven’t reached our top form yet,” he boldly announced,
.. “and when these kids get ﬁred up—just watch out.” I strongly sus-
pect that Olson was hedging a forecast and pointing to tomorrow’s
quadrangular meet as the time and place for such goings on.
