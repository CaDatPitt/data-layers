‘Umbrella’ Satire
Takes First Place

By Betty Greiner

“llnibrell.a Man,” the ﬂoat (lec-
oratcd by Delta Zeta, won firstt
prize in the Women’s fraternity
ﬂoat parade last Friday afternoon.

llmbrella man was interp.rete(l
as Neville Chamberlain. Chanig
berlain was standing at 10 Downing
street, while Hitler, across the Eng-
lish channel, aimed a water gun at
him. Mussolini and General Franco
stood back and watched the pro-
ceedings. A
KAPPA KAPPA GAMMA

Second prize in the contest went
to Kappa Kappa Gamma for their
ﬂoat, “My Heart Belongs to Daddy.”
On the ﬂoat was  young girl sur-
rounded by ‘five suitors. She was
chained to a packing box which con-
tained a, large heart. “Daddy,” sit-
ting on top of the box, held the key,
a “Kappa key,” to the girl's heart.

Alpha Delta _Pi won third place for
their interpretation of “Three Blind
Mice.” Two of the mice were sell-
ing pencils and newspapers while the
third one was lying on the ﬂoor minus
his tail. A lady with a carving knife
was standing over the mouse with the
tail in her hand. The cabin of the
truck was covered by_a cardboard
house. , .
TULIP TIME

A very colorful ﬂoat was presented
by Delta Delta Delta sorority in Tu-
lip Time. The "idea was conveyed
chieﬂy by a wooden shoe, a dutch
mill and‘ tulips.

“Darktown Strutters Ball (Striker’s
Brawl)” was erected by Zeta Tau
Alpha. The ﬂoat showed three strik-
ers: two were carrying strike posters,
and the third held a canary. John
L. Lewis and William Green were
sitting on a coal pile.

Other ﬂoats were “Nightmare,” by
Kappa Alpha Theta, “Wedding of the
Painted Doll,” by Chi Omega; “Three
Little Fishes,” by Phi Mu; “Ferdi-
nand. the Bull,” Theta Phi Alpha;
“Toy. Land,” Phi Sigma Sigma; “Mu-
tiny in the Nursery,” Beta Sigma
Omicron; “School Days,” Alpha Epsi-
lon Phi; and “When Pa Was Courtin’
Ma.” by Beta Phi Alpha.

Coal Strike Halts

Business Recovery

First rise in Pittsburgh business
since the April 1 shutdown of bitu-
minous coal mines was seen last week
in the weekly summary of the Uni-
lversity Bureau of Business Research.

The index of district business
climbed fractionally from 63.2 to 63.3
per cent during the week, although
production in many lines dipped un-
der the pressure of negligible bitu-
minous coal production.

The trade index was boosted by
an unusually heavy gain in depart-
ment store sales during the week.
Coa.l. shipments both by river and by
rail, as expected, were small during
the week.

 

During the last half of July Vieh—,

Announcement of the 1939-40 pub-
lication heads of The News, Panther,
and Owl has been delayed until early
this week, Robert C. Machesney, ad-
viser to student publications, an-
nounced Thursday.

Although expecting to release the
appointments‘ at last Friday’s Tay
Day ceremonies, Machesney indicat-
ed that the delay has been “occasion-
ed by the desire to give as complete
as possible consid.eration to the qual-
iﬁcations of the various candidates
for the positions.” 1

announcing that interviews for can-
didates would be held, he explained
that the new oﬂﬁcers would organize

month.

To investigate a permanent publi-
cation policy, a group of student lead-
ers and faculty members have held
two meetings recently with Rufus H.
Fitzgerald, provost of the University.
Problems and policies of The News,
Panther, and Owl were discussed.
Another meeting is scheduled for the
near future.

Mellon Institute of Industrial Re-
search has been designated “the hub
of the scientiﬁc organization in the
Pittsburgh di.strict"’ according to an
article in the science magazine, “In-
dustrial and Engineering Chemistry.”

Sponsoring 86 fellowships—30 mul-
tiple and 56 indiVidual— which em-
ploy 161 fellows and 96 assistant fel-
lows, the Institute carries out. re-
search in as many ﬁelds of industrial
science in conjunction with private
business and industrial concerns, the
report declares. Of that number, 39
have been in operation for ﬁve years,

80 have operated for 10 years, and
eight are more than 20 years old.

In 1938-39 17 new fellowships were
created: acid recovery, draft, electro-
deposition, ethanol, felt, ﬁlter, gyp-
sum, iodine, mcter, pearl, printing,
rubber, silk, dyes, plastics, and tube
and watch technology. A

One of the most interesting devel-
opments made in industrial research
was the Kroger grocery fellowship
which created a “more palatable”
beefsteak. Other groups have been
working on problems such as finding
practical uses for waste liquors of in-
dustrial and chemical processes, pre-
vention of stream pollution by Waste
pickle liquors, new uses for iodine,
and the application of synthetic re-
sins and plastics for the construction
materials of gas meters.

Microscopic studies made by the
,Pearl Associate fellowship have re-
fvealed that not all pearls are com-
iposed of the same variety of carbon-
gate, and that natural pearls are su-
lperior in esthetic quality and homo-
geneous structure over all artiﬁcial
pearls.

The Five Per Cent
Take a Stand

OLLS taken recenllv to test student opinion

on war show a deﬁnite correlation of ll’lO‘ll§’,'ll'l
and a decisive attitude among" the general student
bodies of our colleges and tiniversities.

in a poll conducted by the Daily Nortliwestern.
75 per cent of the student body said they would not
wi.lllng'l_v take part in a foreign war. and 55 per
ceinti declared that tliey would clioosc prison rather
than go to war overseas.

Another, more ‘inclusive poll, concluctctl by a
p’romu1e11t weekly iiiagzizliie, finds that lf the l}'nit-
ed States is drawn into a f01‘t?'lg'll war, 18 per cent
of th ,. students will volunteer, 99 per cent’ will wait
for the draft, and  per cent will 1~c‘t'1isc .tl2:itl._v to
ﬁlght.

Convincing as these ﬁgures seem. the <:1‘istoina1'y
reaction of the tliinking student these days  “so
wl1at'°l” VVasn’t there, he asks, a similiar senti-
ment for peace before and during the early stages
of the ‘World ‘.Va1“? l)idn’t that attiiiide cliangc in
a hurry? Can’t. we expect the same bandwagon
rush, when and if another war should be declared,
or as is more likely, be not declared’?

\Ve, of course, can’t be too optiniistic about
tliese ﬁgures. It's foolish to discount the «neat
possibility of amass niilitarlstic stanipctle wlien
the drums start beating.

Yet in these statistics is a ray of hope. For
here  proof that students are still tliinklng
S‘l.l_‘{l'lQ,‘l’ll'., are as yet (*oi11pai'atively unatfectctl by
the ever-increasing propaganda of lllllll‘c1l‘l$i1ll.

They are definitely pessimistic. as sliown liy tlie

' N01-'t.liwcs‘t.'ern poll indicating that 78 per cent be-

lieve there will be another world war witlim ﬁve
years, and that over liali.’ t.h'inl.: the llnlted States
will become involved.

Some Comments
In Retrospect

l‘.\‘7l"i‘.- of the most hectic weeks in Spring l¥‘csti\'al
liistory is officially eiided.

From arclicry contests‘ to Tap Day asseinbl_v,'

from tea dance to Senior Ball, the week was one of
fast-paced gayciy and festivity. It was, we are
convlncecl, geniiiiicly apprcc'iated by the stiuleiits.

Many tliiiigs were done which, (li1i'i1i§_>' an or-
dinal:-y school week. would have been coiisidci-ed
Iinusual. or out-of-place. Students eagerly took
&(lV.*’3l1l‘.::l.g‘€ of the opportiinity to l"or_<.>'e1" studies and
itililliitions, do a bit of fooling around, and ﬁnd an
outlet for some excess Gll€1‘g‘_‘,' and steam.

lt was, we think, natural that this was so. For
tlic confdmial tension of studies and actlvitisxs de-
mand some relaxation, and the l~‘e:<.l'ival’.~; llardl
Gras atinosplierc was the riglit setting.

For some. the Festival Vv-as a last real ﬂing in
Uni\'crsity life; for ()tl‘l9l.‘S, it was 1nci'cly a plea:-iaiit
interlude.

So it’s back to tlie gi~ii1«.l.

I It is becoming evident to anyone who reads modern
lﬁction today that a slow revolution is making itself felt
‘in that special province cf literature known as “the,
novel of social signiﬁcance.” \

It is about ‘time.

Since the depression, this type of ﬁction has been the
prevailing diet, and it has not been a healthy one. Of
course, the historical romance is still going strong, and,
it still continues to transplant the
tired reader into the happy haze
that was generally supposed to
have su1'rou..nded. human activities
in the reign of good Queen Anne
or in the more robust days of the
Aincrlcan pioneers.

But the Fiction of social signiﬁ-
cance has followed as stereotyped
a path as any swashbuckling ro-
mance, and in doing so, it has lost
‘v\r"l1Jl'.C\7C-‘I’ s.igrilﬁca1'1ce it possessed.

Alniost without exception, the
pa.ter:.1 has been the sanie. Ther- is the :§7oun._g .‘1e1'o
who is ﬁlled with great dreams of making the world
good again, and he sets out to do it. He meets the girl 
- of his dreams, who works in a pickle l'actc‘~.‘y, and ever"-
iliing looks rosy. However, modern society, in ’ll1.~'3 guise
oi’ a coal boss, cuts off his source of revenue, and ‘then
three things happen, namely (1) the young man jumps
.cfi’ a bridge, (2) he starts a strike and gets hit in '-;he
head, or (3) he joins the Communist party and loses; ‘Elie ;
girl who does not give a hoot for the Communists.

This has been the proletarian novel. Then there is
the other type, written by the disillusioned college ,grad-
uate who is out of work. His hero is from the upper
classes. He also has a girl, a sulky beauty who -expects

 

 

Bob Brown

like any other modern young man. But our hero has
read sociology books and has taken a fling at “Das Kap-
ltal” and he has heard the cry of the masses for bread.
So he goes the same way as his proletarian brother, and
the book closes on a note of despair as he looks out over
the roofs of the factory houses and sees no hope for
their inhabitants.

But this stuff which passes for ﬁction is on the way
out. For the new writers realize that there is more in
the picture than’tTrustrated sex-mad ’individuals with
cheap ideals and crazy dreams who are tired of a society
they have not even attempted to understand.

America iepresents more than that, and the newer
writers are realizing it. Europe is a tired continent

America is not. The cities are more than a mad testi-
mony to the shortsightedness of the capitalists. Every-
thing  not rosy for the farmers, but they are still proud
of their great grain ﬁelds and fat hogs and herds of
cattle.

And so we have men like John Steinbeck and Thom-
as Wolfe—men who can write about the slums and still

country with its sorrows and its joys intermingled to
make a picture that is without the distortion and the
bias that makes the other stuff little more than idea
essays with occasional quotation marks to squeeze it
into the class of fiction.

So it seems that there is a new deal for American
literature, and it is a better one. There will still be
-protests, and they will be justified. But the primary
purpo.<.‘.e of ﬁction—-that of creating real people who

“In my opinion, the Great war was
a clash between the old aristocratic
and militarist systems and the new
liberal and democratic conceptions as
they had grown out of the French
and American revolutions one and a
half centuries ago,” the stateman,
of‘ sociology at the
University of Chicago, declared.

Several nations of Europe, especi-
ally Germany, were not prepared for
this freedom, and did not understand
what to do with it. “The difﬁcultles
of the new democratic regimes in Eu-
rope engendered strong, anti-demo-
cratlc movements, and ﬁnally a num-
ber of European states beguii to pass
over to the atithoritarian system,”
Ur. Bones said.

Dr. Beues summed his statements up.
that “an ideal life and world cannot.

One can only ﬁght for an ideal.”

But we should not be discouraged,
for “the noblest part of human lift‘
is not the realization of the ideal-
it is one human nature that as soon
 such an ideal is even partly rea-

everyday great reality with all the

“And only a constant, unrelenting

By Arthur Reinstein

Phi Delta Tlict;-i is in! Paced
by burly t'ootballe'r John Dickin-
son, the Phi Delts rolled up 43
points, 11 more iilztll the deteiid—
iiig clianipioii Phi Gains. to pace
the field in ’.l.“lu1r.s(‘lz1_\"s Spi-i1i.g'
Festival feature.

Kappa Sigina’s 14 was good enough
for third, Delta Tau Delta’s 10 for
fourth, and Phi Kappa’s 8 for third,
SAE also scored a point.
EU1\lNE1lT{-UPS LAST YEAR

This win made up for a couple of
battles which had established the
‘Phi Delis  second—place champions.
‘Last year, they were runner-up to
LT-‘hi Gamma Delta in th_e Frat Track
Meet; just last Monday these same
Fijis blasted the Phi Delt mushball
t;ro_ph;.r vision with a humiliating 16-0
triumph. But Thursday’s meet told
a different story. (We might add
here, before the champs start throw-
ing tomatoes. that the name “Phi

Delta Theta” was not even mentioned 

by us in the pre—battle plug). Now
I know I’m an expert.

The Phi Delts took three ﬁrst, and
placed in every event but the pole
‘vault. Although Dickinson scored
two of these first places, and anchored
the 440 relay to the third, Bob Dan-
nies was the surprise of the meet.
‘The famous football man, mushball
-coach, and man-about-girls put on a
neat exhibition of speeding on two
occasions; the 440 and 880 relays.
DANNIES IN RELAYS

In the 440, Bob helped fraters
*Gregg, Smith, and Dickinson to the
‘top spot. “Fumbler” Dannies was in
second place when he snatched the
"baton from Gregg, but he ended his
lap a step in the lead. Smith handed
Dickinson a slight margin, and big
“Dickshot” snapped the tape ahead
of Phi Gam Pressel’s driving ﬁnish.

Delta Tau Delta, with Geiger,
‘Jones, Hawkins, and Hepburn, ﬁn-
ished third, while the Phi Gain run-
neriup four showed Roberts, Grosset,
Smith, and the aforementioned’ Earl
Pressel. Incidentally, this race had
exactly the same result last year:
Phi. Delt, Phi Gain, Delt.

Kappa Sigma took care of the Phi
Delt-Phi Gain feud in the 880 relay,
ﬁnishing ﬁrst in 1:38, a good 11 sec-
onds under last year’s mark. And
this despite the fact that Kappa Sig
anchor man Wuertenberger was
coasting at the ﬁnish.

MORE FOOTBALL MEN

This race was even up to the half-
way mark, but there George Kracum
(What, another football player‘?
‘Maybe I should have saved that “lu-
gitives t'rom a football practice” line
for this story. But I guess one air-
ing for a gag like that  enough)
. .  I was saying, there George
I~Zracuni settled the issue with a blaz-
ing .920 which pushed the rest of the
ﬁeld into the also-ran pile.

Chucl: Wu.erten’oergei' was running
all by himself when he C1'OS.>€fd the
:tln:ish line. Edmunds and Conrad
were numbers 1 and 2 for the win-
ners; Phi. Delts Springer, Dannies,
Sinith, and Snyder, and Phi Gams
Smith, Goodriazh, Bowiiian, and Rob-
erts nailed down second and third re-
spet:tive-ly.

Add deep thoughts: Phi Gain Doug

In the ﬁrst heat, Dickinson of the
Phi Delis barely otitstricled Phi Gam
Pressel by .2 of a second. George
Kracuin, the ﬂying Kappa Sig, sand-
wiched into second place with a
sprint just .1 of a second off Dickin-
son’s time.

Phi Kap Pat Cusick clipped 31/2
se«,:on.ds oﬁ last ye:-ii"*s 440 mark with
a 55.5 quarter mile. The red-headed
SFA prez moved out in front at the
first turn and was  headed.
Delta Theta. grabbed 4 more points
in this race as Scherer and Park took
second and third.

TEIURBON' VVINS DASH

Bobby Thurbon oi the Phi Gams
scored easily over Gurzenski of the
Phi. Kaps and Stebbins of the Phi
Delts in the 100  dash. (Say.

didn‘t anybody go to football prac-E

der of Delta Tau Delta sneaked into
third place just 21/, inches ahead of
Phi Gam Quick, who couldn’t get any
further than 37 feet 8 inches.

The shot put brought Sigma Alpha
Epsilon its lone point. Macneil’s
heave of 42 feet 3 inches fell over
ﬁve feet short of Phi Gain 'Watson’s
winning toss—47 feet, 41/3 inches, and
7 inches short of Bob Dannies’ sec-

substantial third and one big point.

An unscientiﬁc, unofﬁcial, and un-
necessary poll of the spectators show-

popular one. Typical comment:
First Kappa Sig-—“There’s no one I’d
rather see win than the Phi Delts.”
Second Kappa Sig—-“No one but us.”

Potts Postpones

Faced with the dismal prospect of
running two-car races over the level
and unexciting course of Pitt Sta-
dium’s running track, Intramural Di-
rector James Potts has done the only
logical thing—postponed the frater-
nity sweepstakes until one week from
today when it will take place over the
original course, Lytton Avenue, climb
and all. Many of the ten frats enter-
ed in the pushcart derby complained
bitterly when the scene of the race
was shifted, so the new arrangement
should be satisfactory to all.

Netters Oppose
Grove City Six
in Next Match

Still elated over their surprise win
from Duquesne last week, Pitt’s var-
sity tennis team tackles Grove City’s
netmen tomorrow at 2:30 o’clock on
the Trees Gym clay. The line-up for
this afternoon's encounter is the
same as the one that downed the
Dukes.

Pitt’s ﬁrst tennzs victory of the
current season was perfectly timed.
The win over the Blufﬁtes put the
Panthers in the top position in the
race for the city net championship.
In a match that was hard fought all
along the line, the Blue—and-Gold
tennismen blasted the high-flying
Dukes by a 6-3 score.

Joe Kristufek shone at the No. 1
position with a brilliant 6-1, 6-0, win
at the expense of Ray McCol1igan,
ace southpaw for the downtown net-
ters. Hartman and Harmuth, at No.
2 and No. 3, lost a pair of tough duels
to McConnell and Pasqualicchio. By-
ron McLaughlin in the No.4 spot de-
feated Kram of Duquesne in straight
sets. Goehring downed Gardlock in
the No. 5 match, and Burns bested
Johnson in a lackadaisical three set
farce.

In the doubles. Kristufek and Mc-
Laughlin beat Duquesne’s McCol1i-
gap and Krarn; Goehring and Har-

from Pasqualicchio and Johnson; and
McColligan and Gardlock took the
measure of Hartman and Kaufman
in the ﬁnal tandem battle. The
Panther netters took four singles and
two doubles matches altogether.

Notiﬁed last week that C. K. Holt-
man, BA39, had been named as a
member of the 1939 All-American
Intercollegiate Small Bore Riﬂeman
Team, and winner of the Golden Bul-
let Award, the University military
department has received another bul-
letin from the National Rifle Associa-
tion stating that Evan T. Sage, C39,

has been named as a member of the
second team.

Sage becomes the third of Capt.
John D. Mitchel1’s team members to
receive All-American rating in two
years. Last year J. Stuart Dieteti-
dorf, C38, now a second lieutenant in
the Coast Artillery at Fort Monroe,
Va., was named to the ﬁrst team, and
,received the Golden Bullet.

The Golden Bullet award, the
highest honor in intercollegiate riﬂe
shooting, is given annually by the
National Riﬂe Association to the ten
highest ranking small bore riﬂemen
in the United States.

The members of the riﬂe team will
receive medals and awards for the
year at the annual ROTC regimental

Back home from Saturday’s match
with Temple, the Panther nine faces
a week of non-competition before
traveling to Indiana State Teachers
College next Saturday.

But that doesn’t mean that the
boys won’t be busy in the meantime.
The recent Penn State doubleheader
brought out several weak spots in
both the Pitt attack and defense
which must be strengthened before
coach Mitterling can feel secure dur-
ing any game, no matter how far in
front the Pitts are.

The most painful feature of the
double loss to the Nittany outﬁt was
the helpless way in which the Pitt
inﬁeld allowed the Lions to bunt
across four runs in
succession. Part of
the trouble can be
traced to the fact
that the bunts
w e r e extremely
well-placed, b u t
the lead—footed re-
trieving of the
Panther inﬁeld
didn’t help a bit
either.

Pitcher Andy
Johnson particu-
larly needs drill-
ing. Despite an
inability to hold
runners on the bases. Johnson
breezed along easily until the bunt-
ing began. Too far in front of the
plate for Gabby Hartman to pick up,
the balls caught Johnson off guard
again and again, and by the time
Andy was ready to make the throw,
another run was in.

Hartman will probably chase high
fouls all week. Half a dozen poten-
tial outs got away from the husky
receiver in the State game, and while
several of the chances were foozeled
after long runs, the others were di-
rectly in I-Iartman’s mit.

Both catchers, Hartman and Guad-
agnino, were off in their throwing
and the State runners stole and stole
and stole. Holbrook and Straloski
spent most of the afternoon backing
up each other on heaves to second.

One cheering piece of work was
Eddie Lawry’s twirling efforts in the
abbreviated second game. Lawry, in
his ﬁrst intercollegiate test, gave
State four singles, two of them
scratchy, in seven innings, then lost
1-0 in the ﬁnal frame on an unearned
run.

The frosh get, their first workout
today on Trees ﬁeld at 3 o’clock un-
der the tutelage of Nick Kliskey.
Kliskey has the basis of a fairly
strong team with Jimmy Egan, Ed

Jones, Eddie Ziolowokski, and
Dichter.

bly only, engagement is scheduled for

Carlson Continues
Similar Testings
For Men Students

Following a Spring Festival week
postponement, the women’s health
service, under the direction of Dr.
Auleene Jamison, will begin tubercu-
lin tests for women students today.

Dr. Jamison, expecting another
“enthusiastic response that marked
the Wasserman test campaign last
month,” will be aided by Dr. Marcela
Acker Helsel, in addition to her
health service assistants. No ap-
pointments are-necessary for the
tests. - |

Second strength tests for men will :
be given today, tomorrow, and Wed- i
nesday in the Falk Clinic offices of,
the men’s health service by Drs. H.‘
C. Carlson and Paul Zehfuss.

Dr. Carlson hopes that the 400 men
who reported for the ﬁrst strength1
tests will return for the repeat per-
formance, providing they reacted;
negatively on the ﬁrst tests. 5

However, all students who react;
positive on either first or second tests 
are advised to be X-rayed, in order]
to locate the presence of tuberculini
baccilli in the body, and thus facili—!
tate a treatment.

The tuberculinu tests mark the

l Glossy ﬁle cases, floods of library

gprints have poured into the school to
‘be arranged within the University’s
‘new “Laboratory of Experimental

g Reason for the valuable inﬂux is
lDr. J. M. Rogoff, who came to the

ifrom Chicago early this year with
[the task of developing here the rela-
}tively new and increasingly impor-
tant ﬁeld of endocrinology.
With Dr. Rogoff brought his private
llibrary, which he estimates as “one
of the ﬁnest research libraries in ex-
|perimental medicine” in existence.
Its 35,000 reprints of research publi-
cations, collected over a period of 75
years, is now available to local med-
,ical authorities and University stu-
dents.

A graduate of Ohio Northern Uni-
