An investigation of discrimina-
tion complaints in Pitt’s employ-
ment practices is under way,
according to Pittsburgh’s National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) Chair-B
person Robert Pitts.

In a letter to Chancellor Posvar
dated May 9, Pitts accused the
Universityof lacking concern for
the afﬁrmative action plan. This

' aw“ {ﬁe pool of job candidates with

qualified minority group and
women applicants.

These complaints stem from an
unequal ratio of black CAS faculty
members to the total faculty. ,

The letter also stressed that the
University keep its commitment to

 Plait Reports:
’ $75 Per Term

 Tuition Increase  

BY PAUL MAZUR

Pitt administrators think the
tuition'may be raised by 15%,
President Larry Platt said at last
night’s Student Government Board
(SGB) meeting.

“That would be an increase of
$75 per term,” Platt said.

Platt emphasized, however, that
this is neither a ﬁnal nor an ofﬁcial
ﬁgure, but merely one that has
been discussed by the administra-
tion. “We know that an increase is

Ounavoidable because of a tight

state budget,” Platt said, “but no
ﬁnal ﬁgure hasbeen reached.”
SGB member Chip Hubbard
asked that, since some sort of
tuition increase is inevitable, SGB
look into thepossibility of having

the invoice _due date pushed back?

“The blacks need this consider-

press conference Monday. “We

utilize the available goods and
services in the black community.”

When asked if the complaints
implied reverse discrimination,
Pitts insisted they did not. “This is

State ‘review begins

Univ. Structur

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The Universityadministration is
under scrutiny by a state review
team that arrived yesterday for a
one-month study of the efﬁciency
of Pitt’s operational structure.

The review team, a part of
Governor Shapp’s program for
improving the impact‘ of state
dollars on. community service, is
basically a follow-up of a 1972
analysis. V .

“It's aimed at making state
operations more efficient,” said
Tom Simon, project consultant for
Warren King Associates, which is

Pitts noted the phrase “lack of

deserve ‘on the job’ training,”
Pitts said. . i '

New Campus Food Firm
Taking Charge June 27

. BY GENE GRAVI/30WSKl U

A Pittsburgh-based food service
management company has been
awarded contracts to manage the
dining facilities at Pitt’s Oakland
and Johnstown campuses begin-
ning June 27, according to
University Director of Housing and
Food Service Tom Albert.

Key Management Serv-ices, lo-
cated in Peters Township, will take
over the job held for the past three

years by Szabo Food Service of"

Illinois.

The one-year» contract was
awarded Key Management Servi-
ces because of its low bid and the
“workability” of a local firm,
Albert said. ‘ .

The decision to give the job to
Key Management Services was
made by Albert, the Resident
Student Association (RSA), and
Vice-Chancellor of Business and
Finance Joseph Dutton.

The University has the option to a

renew the one-year contract at.th
end of next winter term, C‘

probably because it offered the
“good, detailed management”
Pitt’s administration was looking
for. ,

“As a local company we can
better control and manage the
operation than can other _out-of-
state ﬁrms,” Thens said. “That
had even more to do with our
appointment than our bid.”

Negotiations for the contract,
which took place in April, originally
involved, seven food service com-
panies, according to Thens, but in
the end only three companies were
considered seriously for the .job--
Szabo Food Services, Professional
Food Management, ‘and Key
Management Services, Albert said.

Thens, a Greentree resident, is a
graduate of Penn State University.
.The’ vice president of Key
Management_ Services, Victor L.
Scrivo of Mount Lebanon, is’ a Pitt
graduate. Both men are principal
owners of the ﬁrm. .

The company operates dining
facilities in many other colleges,
school districts, nursing homes and

sylvania ~a'n’d ieastern.'Ohioi ’ L ‘F '

 

management ‘in the whole state.
The project is ﬁnanced by the state
business community, it doesn't
cost the taxpayer a cent,” Simon
stated. ,

Pitt is only one of the state
institutions involved in the review
process. According to Simon, all
state-related and state-owned
schools are now under similar
scrutiny. ,

At yesterday's ‘Senate Council
meeting, Chancellor Posvar an-

nounced the arrival of the

management review team, and said
the University will give the full
cooperation to the study.

Two members of the team are

from the study will be made public
and the recommendations will be

Posvar" Pushes Look at‘

-2-Year Degree gProgiram‘

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN T

A proposal giving Pitt authority
to grant associate degrees is being
explored, Chancellor. Posvar an-
nounced yesterday at ‘a University
‘Senate Council Meeting. . .

Two-year programs resulting in
associate degrees would be res-

. tricted to areas without institutions

like community colleges, Posvar
said. ‘‘In a comprehensive

university like Pitt, we have an"

obligation to serve people who are
not servedby such programs.
“The programs must- be viable
ﬁnancially and contain justiﬁable
material,” he added. “Students
enrolled in the associate degree

programs would be subject to the...

same admission standards as other
students.” '

The associate degree plan, which ‘

has been approved by the Senate
Budget Policies Committee with
the stipulation that each program
be examined on its own merit, will
be sent to the Educational Policies
Committee.

s~In his report. to the Senate
Council, Posvar discussed the

   

,9», V

recent State Appropriations hear-_ A

ings. “Despite pessimistic reports,
the attitude on the whole of ‘the-
‘legislature was not hostile,” he
said. i — g I i '

. Posvar explained that because of

the legislative recess it would be A

impossible to provide any concrete
information regarding the budget:

In reference to the, Governor’s'-
Management Review Task Force,
which visited Pitt Monday, Posvar.
emphasized plans for cooperation." -
“There are bound to be some’ good

,ideas--management, ﬁnance‘ and

business affairs--without interfer-
ing with the University’s academic‘
mission.” if  
Reporting to Senate Council,
President Frank Slailghter ex.-'4
plained the Organization .,an-d-L‘
Procedures Committee" is setting;
up a mechanism to provide‘ for,
representation of students of‘-the
branch campuses on Senate Coun-
cil as outlined in the Senate*bylaws_."
Student Government (SG) Presi- V

dent Larry Platt announced ‘SG’s 
interest in reinstatement of the

“We can’t say that (the

Although representation -is high

_g ,4-THE PITT NEws—‘ruesday,”May 13, 1975

The Hopes for Boston

The ﬁght for desegregation in Boston schools has escalated into a
national issue during the past year, and has become an ever-important
symbol in the continuing struggle for equal education.

_ It was long thought that such primitively racist attitudes could be
, ..'found only in the South, the much-touted hotbed of racial conﬂict in the
United States. But the recent display of violence over busing to
achieve integration in Boston shocked the nation into ﬁnally accepting
a North whose social views were not so advanced.

a The nnssive protest scheduled by the National Association for the
, Advancement of Colored People on May 17 in Boston will undoubtedly

47:  a student delegation under the auspices of the National
 Student Coalition Against Racism. .
Its duty at the protest will be to represent the desire forintegration
V" by Pitt "students in not only Boston schools, but all schools throughout
4:. the country. ,
 Despite court decisions and social laws to the contrary, the past 20
years have found a large portion of Americans guilty of the same
{ prejudices that ﬂourished a hundred years ago. If we have learned one
;thing in the past two decades "of civil rights legislation, it is that a
, country ‘cannot hope to follow its own laws regarding human equality if
‘those beliefs are not ﬁrst a part of the national conscience.
' ’IheBostondemonstratorswillhaveas their prime objective thetask
* ofimpressingupontherestofthecountry their seriousness, andmore
fiimportantly, their numbers. If any movement in the United States
 hopes to succeed, it must show a consensus of support. For the student
 nnrchers, the goal is a loftier one." Not only must they present
 ‘themselves as responsible leaders in the struggle, but they must
 has a future in America. -
A whole generation has come and gone since the historic Supreme
 Court decision Brown vs Board of Education, a case that originated in
Little Rock, Arkansas, provided for nationwide integration. “Separate
" but equal” schools are inherently unequal and do nothing to alleviate
the conﬂict between cultures. The integration of color hopes to lay a
», foundation on which a new national conscience may be built.
A Those Pitt students who will march in the streets of Boston this
r_ weekend will prove that prejudices based on mere color are tragically
» out of place in the Twentieth Century and that violence in reaction to

I the enigma is just an impulsive and irrational response by those who
fail to see reason. ,

In the ill-fated words of his predecessor, President Ford apparently
 trying to “stonewall it.” .

i’-Commission’s “one-bullet theory” is supported by available evidence.
’  A This is true, but only in regard to the evidence released to the public.
 . Skeptics have based their theories on the gaping holes left in the
‘ Warren Report by the Commission’s failure to call on literally
3 hundreds of eyewitnesses and its refusal to release select information
 before the year 2013. ‘
" - ‘Though those who ﬁrmly believe in a conspiracy have conﬂicting
; hypotheses, the endless list of questions left suspiciously unanswered
’ if by the Commission has outweighed any validity the Warren Report
may have had. -
Several independent investigators have booked campus tours and
television spots to gain support for latmching another investigation.
‘_ v One of their contentions is the Commission’s neglect in determining
 any involvement by the CIA, which ‘in those days was untouchable, and
y by Lyndon Johnson, who in those days was president.

,_, - So many questions and so few answers reﬂect a government and a
-‘society unconcerned with historic reality. And the decision to withhold
, certain evidence until 50 years hence, under the premise of protecting
 a grieving family, can ' signal only the advent of an age of
.__totalitarianism in which the government decides what the people
» should and should not know about events that change the fate of
. _ mankind. Such an Orwellian preordering of history and historic fact is
I  ;« exemplary of the Soviet government, not a modern democratic system.

. " C , Had the assassination taken place before the nuclear age, the world
_ ,  * would not have been so dennnding of clear-cut answers. But at a time

when the chief executive is subject to split-second decisions that.

  conceivably can decree the death of billions, there can be no room for

glmsights that may be uained on him.
 _- ’ The transition .to power cannot be made quickly enough in times of
. x crisis. Powerful groups that seek to manipulate history for their own
_’ 1 design will be able to do so with little effort. '
 V ‘ The failure to reopen the investigation and come to an indisputable
 conclusion leaves the United States helb
invisible puppeteer. In light of the nature of conspiratorial
assassinations, such passivity on the part of society may even by
encouraging to cabals, since trigger-pulling dupes are a dime a dozen
and chains of command are long enough for conspirators to hide
behind. .
The investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy must

New Economics: Cry Uncle

BY CAL RITCHEY

When one-has something to sell,
and when there are no customers--
or when there are not enough
customers to support the continued
production of that ‘something,’ the
cost of that item should be reduced
to persuade buyers to examine the
item.

In economics, that translates into
the law of supply and demand: The
supply, in an open market, will
equal the demand, and vice-versa.
Taken a step further, if two people
offer the same or similar items for
sale, and if the supply is greater
than the demand, both people
cannot survive unless they make
their product attractive enough to
create an expanded demand. The
traditional method of creating
additional demand is by lowering

T "prices, or increasing the effective-

ness of the product. ,

Somehow, we Americans seem
to have forgotten about that law.
Somehow, we have gotten the idea

. that if we cannot attract customers

because our prices are too high, we
can make more money be increas-
ing the prices--or by ‘_ crying
“Uncle!” and asking Washington
for some help. ‘

The list of US corporations in
ﬁnancial_trouble is growing almost
daily: Lockheed, PanAm, many of
the nation's °majo_r railroads and
auto industry giant, the Chrysler
Corporation. While Chrysler has
not yet asked for government
assistance, the other three corpor-
ations have requested massive

transfusions of black ink, in the
form of taxpayer dollars.

No one has satisfactorily ex-
plained why it is right, or even
logical, to expect consumers to foot
the bill for mismanagement of
corporations by top executives who
in some cases earn more per year
than the President of the United
States.

There are those who argue that
the collapse of major ﬁrms would
place an unbearable strain on the
economy. With the possible
exception of the railroad conglom-
erate, most ﬁrms would not
collapse--in fact, if they did not
have the _security of knowing a
government subsidy was virtually a
certainty, their executives would

. probably either shape up or ship

out, at the— request of the
stockholders.

American railroads may be the
exception; some railroad managers
have held that the plight of US

railroads is a result of World War

II, when the railroads were forced-

to run full-tilt for several years
without adequate men and mater-
ials to keep up maintenance on a
regular schedule. Wherever the
fault lies, even the most cursory
examination of railroad lines
reveals that many industries

_depend heavily, if not entirely, on

railroads. Some industries--heavy
equipment manufacturers, for ex-,
ample--simply cannot ship their
products by highway.

But even the railroads "are
plagued by the same ‘narrow

viewpoints that seem to have
infected much of American busi-
ness interests in recent years.

Despite the law of supply and
demand cited earlier, these various
industries apparently see only one

solution to their problems: raise
their prices.
The auto industry is the 

best-known example of price hikes,” -'
but until very recently, airline fares
were going up steadily. Now the
Interstate Commerce Commission

has been handed a proposal to
increase railroad freight rates by a

total of 7‘/2% while those same
railroads complain that they must
have federal aid to continue to
operate.

The problem is that such
injections amount to tacit national-
ization: if an industry is assured of
its survival, where is the incentive
to trim operating costs? The
construction industry has some_
19% of its members unemployed,
yet the remainder are expected to '
seek large wage hikes in this year’s
contracts. The reason is that,_,,,,,_:‘,’°‘\“x.;y,
somewhere along the line, every‘-V"  '
one knows that the US government
will ultimately come to the rescue

if things really get tough.

Perhaps it is time to dust off the
history books and re-examine the
New Deal policies, still in effect
,after 40 years, which have outlived
their usefulness. It Uncle keeps his
ﬁstfuls of dollars safely in the
treasury, perhaps the nation’s
economic picture won't be so bleak
in the near future. K

experience recently in Oakland.

We went to visit a dear friend of
ours who had a serious operation at
Monteﬁore Hospital. We just
drove around for about 2 hours
without any luck to park. We went
up around the Field House and not
knowingthe roads we went on this
concrete road around the ﬁeld
house. We didn’t see the way out
near the Pitt Campus police build-

the pavement and he couldn't move
anywhere. About 5 or 6 campus

there lifted up our car and got it

‘Moby Dick’ in review

 wo Lab:

BY HARRIS LEVY .

Silence. -

The human voice pushed from
speech into chilling laughter and
searing moans. An hour and a half
followed by stunning silence. .

Stillness. --

The human body. Swift,
graceful, precise‘ movement.
Running, stalking, caressing,
crawling. An hour and a half and
the audience was mesmerized into
stillness.

The stage was bare, the light was
on. .

But no one moved or spoke.

N f ,5 Because ‘the Iowa Theatre Lab
V "actors, by revealing their deepest

feelings through sound and move-
ment, had challenged us to explore_
our own emotions. The air was
charged with the impact of people
lost in contemplating newly ‘* sur-
faced fears and visions. New-
comers were afraid to look at each
other, afraid that their faces might
reveal too much, while experienced
viewers drew strength from the
plunge.

The most impressive moment of-

Moby Dick: A Response to
Herman Melville occurs after the
show is over, when you see how

 

 

New ‘Soun

found the experience even more
rewarding. -
Getting to know director Ric
Zank and his nine actors is
remarkably ea_sy. Talking to them
after performances, I found the
preliminary acting that generally
occurs when strangers meet was
avoided. Through their work, the -

. Lab actors hadhelped remove our

masks as well as theirs.

The more familiar I became with
Moby Dick, the more I appreciated
its beauty, honesty and complexity.

I saw Moby Dick three times last
weekend. I’ve never seen a show
three times before--and rarely
wanted to. Most shows would be
disappointing if they were seen‘
more than once. The tricks, the
way the author and production
manipulate the audience would
become more noticeable. -

Moby Dick strikes deeply be-
cause it eschews an artificial
veneer for an unencumbered view
of the actors. There’s no

‘proscenium stage to separate the

actors from the audience. Or to
separate the audience members
from each other.

Moby Dick is performed in a
square space surrounded entirely

  

cl’ System

hangs from a rope in the center.
Zank leads people through a tunnel
in groups of three or four until the

- chairs and pads lining the floors are

ﬁlled. Perhaps 60 people can see a
performance." 

The Lab’s use of the space is
extraordinary. Actors suddenly
materialize from gaps in the wall or
curtains. Many of the sounds are
made off stage and some scenes
even occur behind the curtains, lit
from the back. The Lab really
becomes involved with its space.
The stage doesn’t serve merely as a
platform to hold a play on. Moby
Dick became a different show each
time I viewed it from a different
perspective. Each new angle
revealed new sights and sounds.

The costumes and lighting, like
the set, are austere. The Lab
creates the feeling of a whaling
ship, not the appearance of one.‘
While a whaling ship set is
obviously not a real ship, the Lab
works with real feelings, real fears
and dreams, creating a much
stronger truth.

In Dancer Without Arms, move-
ment was the main technique the
actors used to achieve intimate
contact with the audience. But for

by black curtains. A single lamp ' Moby Dick, the company has been

   Niws is

expanded from six to nine and
audience seating has been doub-
led. The close-range physical
intimacy is no longer as feasible.

So what _could Zank and his
company create that would reach
everyone? Sounds. Moby Dick
shows the Lab pushing into new
ways to reach people without
sacrificing its agility.‘

Pounding, singing and whistling.
There are also a lot of words ‘in
Moby Dick, but they're not used in
a conventional way. Like the other
sounds, they’re used for their pitch
and rhythm. They’re not there to
tell the story, they’re there, as the
other sounds are, for their volume.
The rhythm of incessant repetition.

“I am the Devil!”

“You are the Devil! ” The power
of a scene between Ahab (George
Kon) and the Devil (Ryan Cutrona)
derives mainly from the repetition
of those two short sentences, their
intertwining, slurring, reversal.
Distinct speech becomes shouted
fragmented syllables slammed into
each other with a .haste born of
panic.

A good example of the Lab's use
of words occurs when Ishmael
(Christopher Amato) is crouched
over a dead whale (Jamie Leo). In
dialogue taken straight from
Melville, Ishmael talks about
squeezing the whale, squeezing his
crew mates’ hands, squeezing into
each other. More important than
the content of the lines is the
rhythm established by the use of
“squeezing.” The names of'the
characters are used fortheir poetic
sound as well as for identification.

The Lab has not forsaken the use
of movement.

Expansion of the company has

' enabled the Lab to explore the

power of group scenes, such as the
singing and dancing led by Susan

Rich as she beckons the crew
home. Scenes involving the crew

Greenberg and Helen Szablya}“”

Jamie Leo is interested in visual

things like light shows. He wanted 

to see Buhl Planetarium while he

In case you’ve lived in a cave for
the past two years, the rumors are
true--Pittsburgh does indeed have
a professional tennis team housed
in the big “Igloo” down the block.

The Pittsburgh Triangles have
been smashing and volleying
before few but loyal followers and
playing some of the best talent in
the tennis world. Although a few
faces have changed, the quality
and style haven’t been altered in
the least. - r

Last year, for example,’ Ken
Rosewall, an Australian well-liked
by all who knew him--including
opponents--was the big male star
for the Tri’s. At the end of last
season, however, the 41-year-old
Rosewall announced he was retir-
ing from the Pro ranks.

This year a bright new face has
taken his place. Vitas Gerulaitis
came to the Triangles and was
immediately pressured to perform.
Gerulaitis is a quick player who
uses excellent moves to return
opponents’ shots. He also is a
young player with many years of
playing left.

Probably the biggest star on the
team is “the tallitree by the still
water,” better known to those who
don’t speak aborigine as’Evonne
Goolagong. Goolagong came to the
Tri’s just last year and made a hit
with the crowd and with her
teammates. With her quiet actions

’ and shy smile, she seems a perfect

lady. But on the coiirt she can be a
viper, her brow tensed in steady
concentration. V

A few years ago, the word on
Goolagong was that she broke
down and lost concentration during
big matches. This isn’t the case
any longer. Perhaps it took a few

more years of growing up, or-

maybe it was a .-matter of playing

“It was very depressing to
me,” recalled the 18-year-old
Cefalo, who will be the starting
flanker for Penn States 1975
football team.

"It s not easy to live with that
kind of pressure,” said the deep-
thinking young man. “I was
hoping it wouldn't happen when I
went to college."

But it has.

Lefalo gained .344 yards in 53
carries for a 0.2 average and caught
0 passes for 144 yards last season.
for States Cotton Bowl champions.

He showed signs of greatness in
the way he ran and received.

Despite Coach Joe Paternois
efforts to protect the freshman, the
Not
only was he a good athlete, but he

was refreshing to interview. He’s
just what Paterno looks for, a
student-athlete.

»Lelalo has resigned himself to
the publicity.

"1 in starting to realize that’s the
way it s goiiig.to be," Cefalo said

before one of last week's windup'

spring training practices. “I keep
in mind, though, that I don't really
have to satisfy people. I only have
to satisfy myself and my coaches
and the team. I don’t feel like I
have to score or rush for 100 yards
a game."

Lefalo was genuinely surprised
that he played as much as he did
his freshman year. He knew
Paternos fixation about playing
sophomores, let alone freshmen.

“It really startled me,” he
recalled. "I didn’t expect to start
my first year. I was surprised with
my success. I think I played in
situations where l was able to rack
up statistics.”

Lefalo obviously is modest as
well ‘as talented. ‘I-Ie starred in
States victory over Baylor in the
Lotton Bowl, not considered a
proving ground for freshmen.

the I57-pound Cefalo sees his

sophomore season as a much
tougher challenge.

"The other teams have had a

chance to_ defense my style of

play,” Cefalo said. “And the
public expects more of me. I hate
to get into a situation where people
expect something frome me.”

Pl’aterno feels the same way as
the 0-foot Cefalo about the fall
season ahead.

"He (L‘ef'aIo) will have to be
better to do the same job," Paterno
said. "People are aware of him.
they now realize how good he is. It
won t be easy.“

Paterno, however, has no doubt
that Cefalo will rise to the occasion.

"I-les got that poise," said the
coach. "lies a smart kid, -a good
student. He has awfully good
judgment. He’s humble in
dealing with people, not a false
humility. He's genuinely con-
cerned about other people."

Paterno believes Cefalo has the
confidence of a great athlete.

"bive him an opportunity and he
can take it." the coach said. "He’s
a big play football player. I hope
we re smart enough to use him
properly."

harder and wanting .to win more,
because today she is regarded as
one of the top five women players
in the world.

Rayni i~‘ox may seem like a
strange name, but the 18-year-old

who bears it was the top junior-

player in the United States until
she turned Pro. She is the new face
of _the Triangles, and last week
against the Los Angeles Strings she
received her baptism by fire from
the dragon lady herself: Ms Rosie
Casals.

Although Fox and her partner,
Nancy Gunter, lost to Casals and
Kathy Harter, it was little Rayni

who dazzled everyone-.-including"

Casals--in the doubles matches.
Even the acid-tongued Rosie
praised the youngster’s play,
saying she had performed very
well, considering it was her first
time in team tennis.

Team tennis is still in its infant
stage and has many bugs to be
“worked out. But the point is, the
Triangles are in town and are
playing some of the world's greats.

Triangles in Action

 

The pictures on this page show
the Triangles’ top two players-- »
Evonne Goolagong and Vitas
Gerulaitis--in action at the Civic
Arena. Both players are young and
very talented and hopefully will
stay with the Tri’s for many years

to come. Wilson Photos.
