 Campus Committee 8

By PAT POLLINO

Student Government has adopt-

ed. a proposal -for the organiza-.

tion of a Regional Campus Com-
mittee to coordinate activities with
the University’s four regional
campuses.

Purposes outlined for the com-
mittee are:

-—To introduce University stu-

"dent activities to students at
regionals.

—To organize visits to the Uni- .

I versity so that these students will
become acquainted with the phys-
ical plant of the University.

' -—To, encourage regional stu-
dents to attend University
athletic events and social events.

—To devise ‘a systemized com-
munication between the Univer-

‘sity and regionals.

—To conduct a pre-orientation

—To provide outstanding stu-
dent leaders on regional cam-

lend themselves to University
student activities when they ar-
rive on Oakland Campus.

—To create a feeling of one-
ness among the four regionals and
mother school.

New Coffee Hour Forum Series

p Brings Administrators To SU

By J OSEY GROSSMAN

The Student Union Forum Series, as spurred by

A chairman Mike Marcuse, is bringing Chancellor Edward"

H. Litchﬁeld to the SU Lower Lounge next Monday at 3
p.m. to chat with the student body, in the ﬁrst of a num-

ber of “Administrative Coffee Hours.”

Challenged by~the “great communication void at the

University, where the policy makers rarely know What
the students are thinking and therefore may make policy
inadequate for the total student picture and where ad-

ministrative rationale may seem nebulous to the students, '

the SU Forum felt it could ﬁll the gap.”

Marcuse approached the Chancellor last spring out of

a personal interest realizing that he “really didn’t know .

‘theipresident of his university.” Between his initial’ at-
tempt to make the appointment in February and the 15-
minute interview in June, Marcuse devised the means to
let all students have the same opportunity he was getting.

Chancellor Excited

“The Chancellor was really excited about the idea,”

Marcuse exclaimed. “He said he certainly would partici-
pate and that he would strongly urge any other adminis-

trator we approached to do likewise.”

The committee decided to pose two types of ques-
tions — the one set previously prepared “covering the
general areas the committee judged the students would

question,” and the other spontaneous questions from the

floor.

The eight general ‘tops given» to the_Chancellor last-— 7
Thursday for his consideration cover 1) the right, lack of 4 ~

right, ‘or the responsibility of individual professors to

express his owngviews to his students regarding Univer- ; _~
.sity or world issues " 2) what value is placed on class-

room teaching ability in; the acquisition of new professors.

3) the non-academic responsibility of the individual

administrator to the student body .4) the current state

of the Oakland Redevelopmenfproject 5) the speciﬁc at-

tempts being made to attract the academic elite of both

Pennsylvania andout-of-state high schools. 6) the role of
Pennsylvania and out-of-state high schools.’ '

7) the role of the Department of the Dean of the Stu-
dents toward the other administrative department and

toward the whole of the student body and

8) what

vigorous steps the University has taken to stop discrim-

ination on its campus.

Calendar Planned For October

Tentative plans call for the in-

week of October. Organizations
delinquent in replying to the let-
ters are asked to do 'so immedi-
ately.

The Freshman Outing was at-
tended by 675, an increase of 175
over last year. Chairman Bar-
bara McKcever has, been re-
appointed chairman for the
Freshman Outing, winter tri-
mester. -

Trophy Meeting Scheduled

Representatives of the Trophy
Committee will meet with mem-
bers of fraternities and sororities
at the Field House tomorrow night
to discuss the awarding of Spirit
Trophies. Letters will be posted
concerning this matter on each
floor of the dormitories.

An information desk will be
open from 5 to 11 p.m. Friday
and 8 to 10:30 a.m. Saturday in
the Student Union lobby for
Parents Weekend. Football tick-
ets will be sold or distributed
to parents at that time.

For those parents who are not
attending Saturday’s game, the
Pitt Players will present “The
Sand Box” at 2 p.m. in Stephen
Foster Memorial. Eleven organiza-
tions will hold open house and
two organizations a brunch fol-
lowing the game.

' Great Response

Owing to a large respoise re-
ceived from letters dispatched,
discussion groups for Parents
Weekend_have been moved to" the
Cathedral.

A proposal to forward a re-
quest to the library asking for
longer weekend study hours
(and longer weekday hours
come mid-term’ and ﬁnals) was
adopted. The smoking prohibi-
tion in the library was also
rapped.

Ineligibility of three athletes
was discussed in’ a report submit-
ted by the Athletic Committee.
Complaints were aired on the ra-
tioning of great pases to Trees

. Hall pool and the issuance of only

one -date ticket per student per
season. It was suggested an ex-
pansion of the student section at

-the Stadium might be a solution

to the problem of inadequate seat-
ing procedures.

Panhel Clarifies Ideas

On Acts of

Friendship

Student to student relations clearly meant only as acts
of friendship are not to be construed as violations of women’s
rush rules, Panhellenic Council clariﬁed at Wednesday night’s

meeting.

Speciﬁc reference was to the rulein the Panhellenic
Handbook that states “Be careful to accept chat dates only

for the (proscribed) days and¢

times and in the proscribed man-

ner . . . (and) make no dates for
meals or other university events
other than athletic events.”

Panhel was concerned to make
clear that this was not meant to
restrict sorority girls from eating
in groups with non-Greek trans-
fer students or from polite casual
conversation when approached by
freshman women ignorant of the
rule.

Not Avoiding Freshmen

“We want to make sure that
freshmen women and new trans-
fer students realize, however, that
we are not trying to avoid them.
After careful deliberation, Pan-
hel has established these rush
rules ‘for the good of the fresh-
men —— to give them time for a
fair look at the college and to get
adjusted to college life,” presi-
dent Susan Canter explained. '

At the meeting Panhel also
voted not to raise dues.

Present dues are a minimum of
$20 for each sorority plus $2 for
each member after the 16th mem-
ber. -

Tomorrow night, according to
plans made at the end of the
meeting, -all sororities members
will meet in the quadrangle in
order to go in a body to the stad-
ium for the all-Greek pep rally,
arranged to stir fraternity and
sorority enthusiasm for the foot-
ball games.

Bostonians Hear

Chancellor Speak

Last Tuesday and Wednesday
Chancellor Edward‘ H. Litchﬁeld
traveled to Boston where he ad-
dressed the Alumni Association of
that city; This trip is the ﬁrst in

a series of ﬁve one- or two-day
tours. He will also speak to alumni
groups in Chicago, Buffalo, St.
Louis and Atlanta.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld engages in
a similar series of tours every

of the tours is “to tell the story of
the University of Pittsburgh and
the changes at Pitt to interested
alumni.” _

The remainder of the tours will
be spread out over the fall and
winter seasons. Colangelo also
stated that several other cities
may be added to the present
agenda.

In addition to alumni associa-
tions, Chancel1or.Litchﬁeld ad-
dresses high school guidance
councelors from the area in which
he is speaking.

Well, Clean .

By LARRY BERNFIELD
The Inter-fraternity Council an-
nounced that with few exceptions,
fall rush was clean and well-run.
Howard Drucker, chairman of
the .Rush committee, presented
ﬁgures showing the total number
of men involved in Rush. 335 men
registered at the smoker and dur-
ing the week following, 250 re-
ceived bids, and 166 men accepted
bids. '

IFC president, Mark Bebko
pointed out that although this ﬁg-
ure represents a, drop from the
187 men accepting bids last year,
the present ﬁgure does not include
those who are eligible to join dur-
ing open rush. Bebko expects this

, year’s total to surpass last year’s

when-open rush is taken into con-
sideration. .
Open Rush Planned

The council decided to hold
open rush this term from last
Thursday until Friday. During this
time a fraternity can bring a man
directly to the Dean of Men’s
oﬂice to register, or they can send
the bid to the office and have the
rushee pick it up. ‘

One infraction of rush rules
was officially reported to the
rush committee. The infraction
consisted of a fraternity man

Current Aims
Call for Span
Of N ew Areas,

By_BETSY EDISON '

In colleges ‘and universities

across the country there is almost

always a student government of
some sort, existing either on a
name-only basis or as an integral
part of compus life.

4ft the University, SG president
Martin Landy and vice-president
Gussie Smith have ambitious aims
for the 1963-64 year.

a “We think that last year’s stu-
dent government was quite good,”
noted Landy. “We’d like not just
to equal it, but to keep the stand-
ard going up.” ' ’
Role Dependent on Leaders
The role of a ‘student govern-
ment is dependent upon its lead-
ers and activities. “The prime.role
of student government is to make
it possible for the student to'ex-
press himself in university af-
fairs," stated Landy, “and to make
known his opinions. . _,
“Part of our platform last
Spring was better communica-
tions with the students; 'we’d
like to reach a larger number
of students and to "go into new
areas.”

“As fulfillment of this, we have
set up the Liberal Arts Cabinet,
composed of six people, to deal
with personal grevances in aca-
demic areas, to recommend chang-
es, and also to‘ act as communica-
tion between students and admini-
stration. This cabinet will work
closely with Dean Martin.”

Freshman Immersed in SG
“If you take a look at this year’s
incoming freshman,” added, Miss
Smith, “he is immersed in stu-
dentgovernment even‘ before he
steps onto camptis. During the
summer he is sent a letter telling
 [the advantages of‘ SG‘ and
making him aware that it can only
be as strong as he makes it.
“He receives the handbook,
which is also an SG project.
Next comes Freshman Outing
and then Parents’ Weekend -in
October, all SG-sponsored.”
“The role of SG then,” con-
tinued Landy, “is a multiplicity of
roles, the most obvious ‘being so-
cial, for example Homecoming
and Parents’ Weekend. There is
also the service aspect in the
Health Service, Book Exchange,
Personal Grievance committee,
and Human Relations committee.
Covers Academic Field
“The academic ﬁeld is. also cov-
ered by SG in the Liberal Arts
Cabinet and the Scholars Banquet
on the day of Honors" Convocation.
These are a few of the things and
the roles‘ emanating ,from SG.
“I think thatperhaps the best

deﬁnition of SG.is found in the
SG Handbook,” said Miss Smith.
“ ‘Student Government . . . is
continually working to accom-
plish varied goals, to provide a
channel of communication be-
tween. faculty, students, and
administration. SG promotes,
sponsors, and supervises. activi-
ties which it deems to be in the

best interests of -school and
student."

“I think because of the dormant
status of SG in the past -at Pitt,:'

she continued, “people were just
not interested. This year, to keep

students aware of what activities.

are going on, SG will publish a
bi-monthly Calendar of Events
‘telling what each organization
has planned ‘for that two-week
period.;_ _

’ Posts Calendars

“These willvbe posted on the
SU bulletin board, in the dorms,
and other key areas around ‘the
campus.” ' ‘

“Communications b e t w e e 11
students and administration are
of prime importance,» and we
are the group to provide under-
standing between the two,”
stated Landy.

“Our role is not that of a Cru-
sader,” added Gussie, “but rather
as a sounding board to try and
explainboth sides of a question.

That’s one place that the Human

Relations committee comes in. By
coming to a committee meeting or
by callingthe ..,cha_irman of this
committee, a student _can make

surance " that something will be

from the student body.

This is an opportunity which should not be passed up. i

 The Chancellor cannot be aware of all the minor and major
complaints which students have registered in the past,aand
‘this is a way to bring them personally to his attention.
This program is not designed to ‘put the Chancellor on V‘
the spot, but it is designed to place him in a position where
he can be reached. Viewed-in this light, it is the most in-
- teresting program involving administrative participation
 which the SU Board has yet offered to the student body.

‘ Even more interesting would be a Coffee Hour at which
Dean Helen Poole Rush was the guest of honor. So many
complaints have been directed at her and_at her depart-'
bents in the past that such a program would go far toward
establishing either the truth or falsity of these accusations.

V The Chancellor has stated that he would encourage any
other administrator to participate in the program if they
were asked by the Board to do so. '

The Board is planning to approach Dean Rush, and we
believe that in the interest of the truth, she should agree to
appear at a Coffee Hour whenever asked.

C-oldwaferi for President . . .i

 

  Ideological Battle

In Scottsdale, Arizona, there is a ranch home
with an electronic ﬂagpole that automatically
raises and lowers Old Glory at the correct times
"of day and night. The owner of the house is the
junior senator from Arizona,~ -
Barry Goldwater- Mr. Gold-
water, for those of you that
compose the 75% of America
that is politically unaware, is
a “conservative” Republican.
In addition, he is also a possi-
ble candidate‘ for the Republi-
can nomination for president
in 1964. Such a candidate, es-
pousing ‘Mr. Goldwater’s right- .
wing views, has been viewed —
with joy by the Kennedy fam- *

-. ily, affection by most right-wing groups, and

suspicion by eastern liberal Republicans. Now
that they have a handsome, articulate, and per-

’ sonable man‘ in the ﬂesh, all of these groups are
morejand rnore concerned, with the substance of-

Mr. Goldwater’s beliefs.

I would argue that the nomination of Barry ‘

Goldwater, for president could lead to- the most
sensational change in American politics in this
century. The root of such a change is Mr. Gold-

water’s belief in the structure of American pol-I

itics.‘ He believes, as do most people of the ex-_
tremes, that politics is an ideological contest -
between good and‘ evil, right and left, moral and
immoral, Communist and anti—C_ommunist. There
is an ideology to ‘defend, namely rural, nine-
teenth-century Americanism—and an ideology to
attack, namely socialism, statism, Communism,
and welfarism. K’ ‘
Ideological Contrast

Mr. Goldwater believes that once America
can see this contrast between ideologies, can dis-

,cern the “deviation from the true path, victory

will be his and j the conservatives will guide us

back’ to righteousness. All of this may seem tri- -‘

vial, but not when we examine the way "Ameri-

Our nation has not operated on an ideological

basis for almost all of its history. Rather, we have

operated 'under a complex system of interest
groups vying for self—gain, and recruiting other

 

By Jim Kleinberg

‘groups to support their cause. ‘No one interest
group, whether formal, as in parties, or infor-
mal, as the AMA, NAM, ADA, B’nai, B’rith, or
DAR, has been able to wield sole and absolute

-power. Every group, in order to pass its wishes

onto society, must glean support from _othe1-
groups. Reciprocity exists to such an extent, that

. there‘ has arisen a wholeset. of unwritten rules

-by which our government abides.

Certainly the Congressional “pork barrel” is
a hot example of this. Every Congressman is, out
to get projects and grants for his district-—and -he"

 

‘‘‘.(.A\

will not criticize other Congressmen for doing the ‘

same thing. The Teamsters Union support“s- gov-
ernment intervention into many ﬁelds, including
Social Security, minimum wage, and anti-trust
legislation. When the union comes under anti-
trust -legislation itself, or is even considered for
such laws, the Teamsters respond exactly as big
business: “This Kennedy -government is a dicta-.
torship!” Self-interest on the part of many groups,
is the modus operandi of the American policy.
Dying System _

Senator Goldwater and the extreme right and
left wing groups in this country all believe this
system is either dead, or-dying. There ‘is a right
and a wrong to politics. This] reciprocal back-
wiping is not effective any longer. As a conser-
vative Republican at the University explained
to me last /year, “Ideology- is the important thing.
American politics is becoming the politics. of
ideology.”

~ There are two reasons why this student is
wrong, and why Senator Goldwater is mistaken.
First, the interest-groups” approach to politics is
that one best suited to our traditions in America
and is too ﬁrmly ingrained in our daily political
process. Second, the vast center of American poli-
ties,‘ the majority of Americans, are either ‘too
apathetic to care about ideological battles or too
wedded to their current system to swing out of
the middle and towards the extremes.

{As this year. comes to a close, and Senator
Goldwater pushes harder and harder for the Re-
‘publican nomination, he will ﬁnd this fact indis-
putable: ideology is not the way to win a con-
vention or run a nation, when the environment

is the United States.

For Women A.-. .

 

_  i Salt On His Tail I

 

,After a midnight stroll across the Cathedral
lawn, an afternoon trip through Schenley Park,
and a visit‘ to a local lingerie store, I’v accepted

the fact that in at least one aspect of our cul-‘ .

ture the male -‘female roles
have been reversed. Courting.

Accepting this stark reality
—I tripped over a female body
as. it inched along the lawn
toward its unwary victim——I’ve
developed a feeling of respon-
sibility to you- the “courters,”
to you the “pursuers,” _to you
the women. I intend, to pass

 

But ﬁrst ‘my qualiﬁcations. V _
After all, why should I be telling‘ you, perhaps

even older ,than I, just how to go about tailing, _
~ unveiling, and nailing a mate. If no other rea-

son, be it this. I was born into blue botties. You
were born into submission. (Theoretically)

And thus we begin. At _ this point I might
state that there are various adequate methods
which the pursuing female couud use. The ,pol-
icy. of this press, however, requires that I‘de-
lete the most apparant. But there are other
means. Among sportsmen there is a rumor that

the way to bag a stag is to put salt on his tail. '

This method I’m sorry to say has proven unsat-
’isfactory on the human male. First of all, you
won’t get him to sit still long enough after that
for’ you to crossyour pre—shaved, pre-messaged,
preposterous legs.

The Best Approach _

Probably the best_ approach is this. For ten
days you don’t smoke, and you don’t drink any-
thing heavier than diluted honey. For the next
two days you watch Casey and Kildare on tele-
vision. For the next day you carry your math
book instead of your Panda bear to bed with
you. "For the next two hours you rub your neck
with a shoe-brush. (That prepares you for a
blue—beard) For the ﬁnal ten 'minutes. you‘ “ run
your ‘tongue gently over th‘e.rim.,of._a coke bottle.

Y6“ are “OW prepared in the most acceptable I

manner—you ‘are desperate.

"Assume this technique has put you in rela._

ii tively close contact with your prey. (Pray? Now,'."

that’s a-thought) Various other gimmicks may be ”
employed at this stage. Dentine behind the r_igh_t
ear serves as a ﬁne adhesive. With a bit of man-
dible manipulation you may be able to mono-
gram youreinitials on his left cheek. A ‘mutual
wound—say two ﬁngers cut as he refrains and
you restrain-—serves' as a ﬁne starting point for
a skin graft. Very permanent.

Of course some of the ._traditional methods
may be reversed to your advantage. For instance,
you mayvshare your cashmere sweater with hima,
simultaneously for the best "results. Or you may
give him one of those sorority pins—you know—~ '
the ones with the ﬁve foot chain.

Consider Oualificai-ions

But by far the most important-matter for you
to consider is just what_ qualiﬁcations your-spouse
must possess.,First of all he must cook. Or have
a degree in chemistry; which little bit of knowl-
edge will do wonders for oatmeal and egg-nogs, .
He must also be somewhat tolerant of children,
or else extremely tolerant of you. Don’t look,
for honesty, you’ll be happier if he lies to you. I

It is wise that your relationship be based 0;;
a realistic attitude toward responsibilities, This
requires that your chattel be familiar with the
innards of an electric washer-dryer, sew_ing ma-
chine, and vacuum cleaner. Shopping is an easily
acquired talent, so you need not worry about
conditioninghim in that role. But be extremely
conservative with his allowance; you never know
when one will marry for money.

Oh, yes. To avoid frustration, marriage coun-
seling, legal compromises and such, he must" be
properly stimulated by the essence of you. .This
means that when in your dainty tone you beck-
on him hesitantly from the bedroom, he must be’
capable of bounding up! the s t airs , crashing

through the-dolor, and movingthe vanity dresser -

‘ craters:

Some Build Rockets, Others Orbit in Them . . ..

Dr. Cohen Explores Craters

By NANCY FUCHS

To prepare for exploration
of the moon, some men build
rockets; others orbit the earth
in them; Dr. Alvin Cohen ex-
plores craters. A professor of
geochemistry at the Univer-
sity, Cohen has been to all but
seven of the 30 North .American
craters in hopes of adding to

scientiﬁc knowledge about the
formation of the earth and the
topography of the moon.

In his most recent trip, to the
wilderness of Northern New Que-
bec, Cohen accompanied four
Canadians from the Dominion Ob-
servatory, as the guest of the
Canadian government. Last Aug-
ust these scientists visited ﬁve
Manicouagan, Lac Cou-
ture, New Quebec, and the two
Clearwater Lake craters.

Caused by Meteorites

All of the craters except Mani-'

couagan and Lac Couture were al-
ready known to have been caused
by meteorites. Cohen and the
Canadians found evidence to in-
dicate that they are meteorite
craters too, thus increasing the
number of such crates by 20
per cent.

The material is believed to
be breccia, angular fragments

held together by a ground mass ‘

of melted rock, resulting from a
shock wave produced by hyper-
velocity impact. Up until then
it was thought to be lava.

Manicouagan Lake, 45 feet in
diameter and probably the deep-
est in Canada, was believedvto be
“a volcanic structure but.,is now
considered a possible impact

_structure,” Cohen explained.

“Very Eroded” . ,
“It is very eroded and could
be several hundred million years
old. If it is a meteorite crater, it
is the largest on the North Amer-
ican continent and the second
largest in the world,” according
to Cohen.

La Couture was charted on
aerial maps several years ago
by.Dr. C. S. Beals, director of
the Dominion Observatory. This
territory was believed never be-
fore explored by human beings
and the lake itself is “150 miles
from the nearest settlement and
inaccessible,” according to Co-
hen. The lake is contained in
two craters, one 18 miles in di-
ameter and the other 13 miles.

The entire ‘lake region is the
sub-arctic tundra a few hundred
miles north of the timberline.
Cohen described it as “very sterile
country.” Many of these glacial
lakes are frozen year-around.

“Impact Structure”
“They are never over 225 feet

“I WAS THERE,” says Dr. Alvin’ Cohen, professor of Geochemis-
try at the University, as he points to the map. ~

deep so when a lake in the area
exceeds this depth—as Manicoua-8'
gan and La Couture — there is a
good chance that it is an impact‘
structure and not a volcanic one,”:
he said. 3

The depth of the lakes was
taken from antique seaplanes.
the only means of transporta-
tion in this area. The scientists
traveled over 5,000 miles-- in a
1938 twin-engine seaplane, using
it as a canoe and tying it up
to ‘the islands.

The expedition was made pos-
sible by a research grant from
the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and the
University. The discoveries will be.
scientiﬁcally announced next
month in Ottowa at a meeting of
the American Meteoritical Society.
But it will take over a year to;
study the materials at the Domin-
ion Observatory and the Univer-i=
sity’s Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences.

Hope to Date Glass v .
Besides studying the breccia;
that was found, the scientists hope
to date glass found at Clearwater
Lakes by the potassium-argon
method and examine shatter
cones, resembling miniature
mountain peaks, which indicate.
that a hypervelocity shock occur-
red. ~

The craters are important, j
“because most of the main fea- A
tures of the moon are believed —
caused by such collisions,” 00- ;
hen explained. The moon has
more craters on its surface be- .
cause it has no atmosphere and
no water, thus keeping the cra- '
ters intact. K .~

Cohen views the moon as “the

International Students Enjoy Picnic

A picnic for International stu-

Pittsburgh.

The day in the country was
jointly sponsored by the Brother-
Sister program and the YWCA.
Some ninety students attended,
according to Han Nyo, chairman
of the Brother-Sister program and
a graduate student in Metallurgi-
cal Engineering.

The students enjoyed an
afternoon of soccer, volleyball,
canoeing, archery and a ten-
man hootenanny. “Everyone had
a good time though we had sore
muscles for a "few days after,”
said Han Nyo.

One of the features of the day,

according to Ha Nyo, was an
American style bull "session around
the campﬁre. One of the subjects
discussed was the new “At Home
at Pitt” program recently set ‘by

the YWCA in cooperation with‘

University professors.
Under the program,

worms: THEIR CAUSE AND CURE

Today let us take up the subject of etymology (or entomology,
‘ as it 15 sometimes called) which is the study of word origins

(or insects, as they are sometimes called).
Where are word origins (insects) to be found? -Well sir, some-

times words are proper names which have passed into the A

language-. Take, for instance, the words used in electricity:
amperewas named after its discoverer, the Frenchman Andre
Marie Ampere (1775-1836); similarly, ohm was named after
the German G.S. Ohm (1781-1854), watt after the.Scot James
Watt (1736-1819), and bulb after the American Fred C. Bulb
(1843-1912). B . ' . . _ «

There is, incidentally, quite a poignant little story about
Mr. Bulb. Until; Bulb’s invention, all illumination was pro-
vided by gas, which was named after its inventor Milton T. Gas

-- , ,_;.w..

   

,1. '1 - ,.u-- '~,'.‘) '\...

who, strange to tell, had been Bulb’s roommate at Cal Tech!
In fact, strange to tell, the third man sharing the room with

Bulb and Gas was also ‘one whose name burns bright in the '

annals of il1umin.ation—Walter Candle!

The three roommates were inseparable companions in col-
lege. After graduation all three did research in the problems
of artiﬁcial light, which at this time did not exist. All America
used to go to bed with the chickens, and many ﬁne citizens were,
alas, severely injured falling off the roost.

Well sir, the three 'comrades—-Bulb, Gas, and Candle—-
promised to be friends forever when they left school, but
success, alas, spoiled all that. First Candle invented the can-
dle, got rich, and forgot his old friends. Then Gas invented gas,
got rich, bankrupted Candle, and forgot his old friends. Then
Bulb invented the bulb, got rich, bankrupted Gas, and forgot
his old friends. . -

Candle and Gas, bitter and impoverished at the ages respec-
tively of 75 and 71, went to sea as respectively the world’s
oldest and second oldest cabiniboy. Bulb, rich and grand, also
went to sea, but he went in style-—as 9. first-class passenger on

_ luxury liners. 1

Well sir, strange to tell, all three were aboard the ill-fated
Lusitania when she was sunk in the North Atlantic. And
strange to tell, when they were swimming for their lives after
the shipwreck, all three clambered aboard the same .dinghy!

Well sir, chastened and made wiser by their brush with peril,
they fell into each other’s arms and‘ wept and exchanged for-
giveness and became fast friends all over again. 

. For three years they drifted in the dinghy, shaking hands
and singing the Cal Tech rouser all the while. Then, at long
last, they spied a passing liner and were taken aboard.

They remained fast friends for the rest of their days, which,"
I regret to report, were not many, because the liner which picked
them up was the Titanic. '

What a pity that Marlboros were not invented during the
lifetimes of Bulb, Gas, and Candle. Had there been Marlboros,
these three friends never would have grown apart because they
would have realized how much, despite their differences, they
still had in common. I mean to say that Marlboros can be lit by
candle, by gas, and by electricit , and no matter how you
light them, you always get a lot to like—a. ﬁlter, a flavor, a
pack or box that makes anyone—including Bulb, Gas, and Can-
dle—settle back and forswear pettiness and smile the sweet

smile of friendship on all who pass! ,, -.

» Slide Rule Registration

ENGRAVING a serial number on the frame of a slide rule  in-
,___,gs sure against loss or theft on a special machine.

;Beta chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, national service
fraternity, is making it possible for all University students
and faculty members to _help insure against the loss of their

slide rules.

The chapter has inaugurated a program of engraving a
serial number on the frame of the slide rule. This engraving

will be done by a special machine:

.,;, .‘-furhich will produce uniform

V

_ 45;,

ﬁgures, according to APO mem- _

bers. _
Any student can register’ his
slide rule between 10 a.m. and 3

p.m. in the _APO.ofﬁce, 312 SU ‘

from October 21 to 25. After. the
initial. registration, students who
have not already done so, may
have their slide rules engraved on

7*the ﬁrst Wednesday of every

month.
, , Aids Recovery «

Walter Turkes, Dean of the
School of Engineering and Mines,
said that “the inauguration of
this program for ,the registration
of slide rules should aid the en-
gineering student in the recovery
of a lost_ slide rule.

“The effective operation of
the plan will assist the admin-

_ ‘wlstrative oﬂices in the School of

 ..

I ‘ gly Man on Campus contest, and

. .~:,z~'.t.-.-.

Engineering and. Mines in the
return of lost slide rules which
are deposted with them.”

A twenty-ﬁve cent fee will be
charged. According to several
APO members, this may well
save a student about $21, the
price of a new one. All money
collected will be used for campus
improvements and projects "such

s the Homecoming queen’s ﬂoat,

a possible combining of all~camp-
us lost and founds.

The students will be given a
wallet—sized registration card and
other cards will be kept on ﬁle.
Several members of APO say this
about the plan, “It’s not a fool-
proof system, but it gives them a

reliance to recover their slide rules
if they are lost and turned into the
APO ofﬁce.”

‘Bags of Glory’

By IVIATTHEW SWETONIC

One sure ﬁre way to make money now days is to build a gigantic novel around the
gigantic events of some gigantic war. The Civil War, for example, has served as back-
ground for hundreds of novelsand a trilogy by Eugene O’Neill.

One war, however, has been ‘mysteriously neglected by Writers in the past, but,

‘fear not,.Stuart Colete, victor of some dozen African-based novels, ‘has come_ through with
.Mgs of Glory (Doubleday, 6319 I ' I

pnggs, $6.95), a chronicle of the
1899-1902 Boer War in South
Africa. E '

‘ After reading Rags of Glory, it’s
a wonder that someone hasn’t
fiumped on the topic before, be-
cause if Mr. Colete is to be be-
lieved (and why shouldn’t we be-
lieve him, he lives in South Af-

rica) the whole bloody mess was
— pretty bloody and thus good novel

material. Maybe other authors
Qured that any book about.South

{Africa would necesarily have to

‘include something about the Ne-
gro problem and thus be rendered_
guite diﬁicult to handle without
offending someone here or there.
,. _ Narry a Negro

'_ This didn’t bother Coleti,
though, he just went right ahead
and wrote about Africa without
including a single Negro in his

_mammoth list of characters (un-

les you consider a stable boy who
lingers around in the shadows
until the last page so he can tell
our ‘hero where Mother burried
the -gold). But this is only a
minor fault.

His major fault lies in his

- , inability to tell a good, convinc-

, ing story. The plot (for want

. of a better word) centers
around a dozen or so major
characters who ﬁght, spy. and
generally raise all sorts of hell
from one end of the Boer re-
public to the other.

Not content with this, Coleti
"carries his tale across the At-
lantic to Britain and into the halls
of Parliament itself with a minor
one hundred page detour into the

swankiest whore house in Lon-.

don. ‘ . ~
‘Take of Two Cities’
Colete’s Tale of Two Cities
(London and Pretoria) is likewise
ﬂlled with the same sort of emetic

characters who populated .Dicken’s’

earlier attempt. First "there is
Elsie, the -sweet, never-;harm-a-
ﬂy prostitute who gives up . her
profession for a «career as a re-
spectacle war nurse. Her lover
is the gallant Captain John ‘Tun-

bull of the second "Hussara who

saves Elsie‘ from her life of sin.
Then there is the Boer fam-
ily Du Toit consisting of Moth-
er, two sons, and a lovely
daughter who exists from the
scene before the novel begins,
a few days before she was to

have wed . . . you glessed it . . . A

the -gallant Captain Turnbull.

There are hundreds more .
or so it seems; the spy, the hus-
sey, the sadist, the coward, the
maniac, the killer, etc.

Lots More
Backing up these stock char-
acters are Winston Churchill,

Lord Roberts, Lord Kitchner of-

Khartoum-, the President of the
Boer Republic, The Prime Min-
ister -of England, and ‘I'm sure

- Nick the Greek is in there some-

where.

The trouble isn't that the char-
acters aren’t interesting (gallant
English captains always set the
heart aﬂutter), but that these per-
sonalities really have nothing in-
teresting to do. They ﬁght, and
spy, and raise hell and when

they’re done; all that can be said
-was that they fought and spied
and raised lots of hell. Whatever

book just doesn’t. come across‘.

O “M other’ 3? ’ ' Not
It Can Be Had for Love‘;

Ron Caplan is a student at
the University. He is also
editor of the unusual literary
sheet, Mother, which will pub-
lish its. second issue some-
time this week. ’

Mother is a mimeographed sheet

,_ of submitted. articles spanning the

ﬁelds of poetry, prose or what
have you. Anyone may submit an
article'—established writer or nov-

“We will publish any form of

writing," said Caplan. “If a per-

son hands in enough «copy, we
may even devote an “entire issue

to his works."

Would Publish Weekly
Plans call for .Mother to pub-
lish every two or three wees,

according to Caplan. He added

that Mother “would appear ﬁve

ted should warrant it." u __
Caplan explained that the
idea. to initiate this literary ven-

ture evolved from the words or .

Robert Creeley—“the dignity of
our own statement.” The title
for the sheet was “lifted” from
a statement by poet»Allen Gins-
berg.

   

for Sale; 

“We're publishing Mother be-
cause we want to,” said Caplan.
“We’ve pondere_d the idea for a 5
long time, and the fact we’ve done 
it is its own defense." 5

Not Libelous 

Asked if his lierary sheet
would harbor on the border of
libel, Caplan replied, “If it’s
honest, it isn't libelous."

Articles for Mother can be
submitted to Mother Press, 230 a
North Craig Street, _'Pittsburgh E
13. Copies of the sheet are dis-‘gr

Vtributed free of charge. ‘

Caplan explained the ﬁrst issue
of Mother was distributed by
hand to University students and
citizenry of the area. He request- ,
ed that “those who would like to I:
get their hands on Mother should 5
send ﬁve 5-cent stamps for the 
next ﬁve issues (to the above ad-
dress).”

Along with the publication of ..
Mother, Caplan hopes to publish 4,, iv
Chap Books — l6—page booklets *7‘ 
of poetry or prose. Covers, he re- H
lated, will be made ‘of original
prints and the booklets will be

one interested in contributing

Michelosensingled out two linemen, in particular, for their outstanding play  the is  .1

tion,” he said. “I wasn’t knocked
down once. This was even better
than the pros do it.”

_ Open Up Holes

The line also opened up many

 

holes for the runners to romp,

through. In the second quarter,
Borghetti threw a block which
sprung Paul.Martha for 25 yards
and set up a ﬁeld goal attempt.
Grigaliunas and guard Ed Adam-
chik also made several blocks
which sent Panther backs for long
gains.
One development which was
a surprise to most fans, but not
to the coaches was the pass
receiving of John Jenkins. The
6-foot-4 end made two sensa-
tional catches which set up the
ﬁrst Panther touchdown, a one
yard sneak by Mazurek. “He’s
always been a good receiver,”
said’ Michelosen. “He hasn’t
had much opportunity. before.”

On the whole, Michelosen was

-yard effort which gave the Hus-
kies'the_ ball in Panther territory
and ‘led to their only score "of the
day.
Michelosen was pleased that
the Panthers did not quit on

. themselves at any point in the_

game. “After they scored, the
boys came right back. This
game wasn’t like last week. We
had to sweat for this win. We
didn’t get the jump on them
like we did against UCLA.”
Husky coach Jim Owens praised
the Panthers for their perfor-
mance. “Pitt has a big, strong
team. They are good players who
know what they’re doing. They
have a well balanced attack and
their linemen blocked V well.”
Owens felt Mazurek’s intercep-
tion was the turning point in the
game. “It took everything out
of us,” he said.

Team Whips

F rostburg For
Fist Victory

By FRED MARCUS

Coach Leo Bemis’ soccer
team will go after their
second straight ‘win of the
season Saturday against Ohio
U. following a 4-0 shutout of
last Wednesday.

Bemis hopes the ' improvement
shown in the Frostburg game
after an opening game loss to
Akron will continue against Ohio.

Against Frostburg the Panthers
slammed in three quick‘ goals in
the ﬁrst period and added another
in the fourth. Dave Reichenbach
scored three goals from his out-
side left post, the third a, head
shot,‘ and Bruno Schwarz ram-
med in the ﬁrst goal of his col-
lege career. '

Reichenbach, a junior, now has
a college total of nine goals.
Bemis said “Our line should
have scored seven or eight goals
without any question. That’s one
of the reasons for our having to
work hard.” / _
Midﬁeld Work Improves
He also thought the team mis-
sed a lot of headballs. “And we

i'weren’t able to possess enough
‘ goal kicks,” he added. -“We con-

ceded the goal kicks on both sides
or the ﬁeld to them about 90
per cent of the time. Our midﬁeld
work improved a little, but we
ran out of steam in the second
half." I.
Bemis was well satisﬁed with
the team attitude. “They showed
they wanted to win that gaine,”
he said. He also was satisfied’
with team play in the ﬁrst pe-

tiod, during‘ which the half-

A  Freshman Football Squad Aids

Varsity; Plays Opponents Hole

By FRED

\

BERLIN

When the freshman football ,team opens its season
against the Navy October 5th they will present an offense
that will leave even Chancellor Litchﬁeld wide eyes. In
past weeks the Cubs have been assuming the roles of the

}'”varsity’s opponents and they intend to use a combination of

‘these plays in their games according to coach Bill Kaliden.

, _As the result of this type of_
practice Kaliden feels that the

young Panthers have had some
good drilling. The work of the
‘tackles has pleased him particu-

larily. At present however, he has
no plans for nameing a starting

, lineup. i

“We’re trying to develop a new
policy here,” he stated. “We
don't plan to have_a starting team
as such. We want to keep every-
one playing. This should keep all
the boys happy and give'them a
good chanceto learn.”

Frosh Show Eagerness

Practicing with the varsity has
other advantages. Kaliden said,
“I think that these practices help
the varsity tremendously. These
freshmen are real eager and this
makes it rough on the reegulars.
We did as well against them as
UCLA did.”

The only drawback to not
training alone isithat the Cubs
fall short _on defensive work.
“We try to sneak some in when-
ever we can,” commented the
Cub mentor, “but it’s some-
what of a problem. On the
other hand, we’re fortunate
because this year it would be
-hard practicing by ourselves.
We don't really have ‘enough
players for that.”’ ‘

So far the freshmen have not
shown any special weaknesses.

Meeting Set

The intramural athletic de-
partment’s ﬁrst step toward
increasing participation in
athletics faltered last Thurs-
day, but Leo Bemis, the program's
director. is still optimistic; An-
other meeting is scheduled for to-

I A Vfnorrow noon in the lower lounge
of the Student Union. ‘ A

The meeting will note, be as

comprehensive as-the ﬁrst, which

was designed to set up the three
geographic teams determined by
the city’s three rivers. This meet-
ing also marsﬁthe last time for
entry in the independent touch

l football ‘league. -

Bemis expressed confidence in
the geographic teams program. ‘_‘I
think if we keep working on it,

,and can once get this program

established, it will be successful,”
Bemis said. ‘

Bemis expects word-of-mouth
publicity to contribute to the
success of the program. “If the
guys who come bring their
friends with them, the idea will
spread. .

“As of now we have about 20

students in the new program,‘so ~

we have two sure touch football
teams,” Bemis said. ,

Bemis attributed the failure of
the ﬁrst meeting to the Jewish
holy days, Rosh Hashanah, “I’m
sure we would have had more
students there if not for the holy
days,” he said:

Bemis has stateduthat he be-
lieves’ there are many students
who communte to school7 that do
not participate‘ in intramurals be-
cause they have" no ‘group to af-
liate with.,_- "Under this new plan

_name appears in the headlines.‘

Besideshis name does not ﬁt in
most headlines. P

As one Pitt coach put it: “John
is not spectacular. He just does
everything well.”
' -Too Awkward

But John hasn’t always lived
up to his appraisal. When he en-
tered Pitt in 1959 his awkward-
ness was obvious to coach John
Michelosen’s staﬁ. So, they de-

cided to hold him out of competi-
tion fora year under the erst-
while “Red Shirt” program.

‘(If I ‘hadn't been red-shirted, I
probably never would have had
the chance to play football like I
really could. It also helped me in
school, too, for I’m in a ﬁve-year
engineering program.”

Actualy, John doesn’t need
any help in school. He’s an
electrical . engineering in a j o r
with a B average.

In fact, it was a worry over the
lack of‘ concentration on his
studies last year that makes him
one of the few collegiate gridders
in the country with an ulcer.

?‘Yeh,” he said, “I guess that
probably was the reason for my
ulcer. But it’s cured now, so the
doctors say. ‘But I’m not sorry I
took the time to play two sports.
I’d do it over again if I had to.
I really enjoyed both sports.

If John plays as well this year
as he did last, perhaps even the
citizens of Ellsworth will take no-
tice. '

Pittsburgh Weekly Sports Fore-sees
Eventual. Decline in F oothalli Here '

Pittsburgh Weekly Sports, the
provocative tabloid edited by Jim
O’Brien, poses a challenging edi-
torial question in the coming issue
concerning the future of Pitt’s
football teams. A .

The editorial says that both Pitt
and Penn State can not survive as
ﬁrst .rate football powers’ under
the present academic standards.
Both teams have recruited below-

i

par freshman teams for the third
straight year, according to the ar-
ticle, and next year’s results may
prove this..

Pittsburgh Weekly Sports con-

tends that Chancellor Edward H.
Litchﬁeld is wrong when he says
that Pitt can be both _a pillar of
scholarship and football at the
same time. ..

e ’   't’;s

Two games. were played in
the Fraternity B softball league
last week. Phi Kappa Theta
nocked off’ Pi
10-4 and Phi Gamma Delta
clobbered Sigma Alpha Epsilon
25-10.

The Dorm Leagues"are also

in full swing as the double
elimination league is already in
the semi-ﬁnals. The winner of
Tower A, ﬂoors 5-7 and A 8-10,
will then meet the winner of
the Hornets and Tower B, 5-7
game. ‘ *

The Independents have been I

apathetic to any type of sched-

uling and with only three teams ~

in the league, forfeits have
been the word.

The league includes the MBA ‘A I

(Business school), Varsity Hall,
and the Untouchables.

“Varsity Hall s_eems ‘much
more powerful than the other.
two teams and should win
easily,” said assistant director
of intramurals Torn J ones.

“The reason the‘ Independ-
ents aren’t going well this year
is that the Dorm Leagues took

all the boys from school,” he i

said.
