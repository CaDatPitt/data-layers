T-shirt sale proceeds help Pitt alumna

By Colleen Denne
Staff Writer

- Sisters of the Chi Omega sorori-

- ty are selling T—shirts to raise

money for a Pitt alumna who

3 received a liver transplant in
June. _

The sorority hopes to raise be-
tween $4,000 and $5,000 by the
middle _ of February. Michelle

' Freed, chairwoman of the sale,
said that $1,000 has already been
raised. «

‘ All of the profits will be donat-

pay the medical expenses she has
accumulated since the transplant.

Hugus, a communications
major and a sister of the Chi
Omega sorority, graduated from
Pitt in April of 1988.

On May 28, 19,88, Hugus be-
came violently ill. Her condition
worsened and after seeking med-
ical attention in Greensburg, Hu-
gus admitted herself to
Westmoreland Hospital, where
she was diagnosed as having
hepatitis. Hugus was then moved
to Presbyterian—University Hospi-
tal. A liver transplant_yvas perlg»

formed by Dr. Thomas Starzl, a
transplant surgeon.

Although Hugus is still on daily
medication to prevent rejection,
she is able to work. She recently

-began working at Sears in

Greensburg.

Hugus still receives medical at-
tention and incurs medical bills.
According to Judy Hugus, Jen-
nifer's mother, insurance covers
quite a bit of the cost, but there
are still bills which need to be
paid.

A group called ”Friends of Jen-
nifer” has been set up in Hugus’

hometown of Greensburg to help
her with long—term costs. Chi
Omega’s fundraiser will provide
additional help. 4

According toMrs. Hugus, ”Jen-
nifer was pleasantly surprised and
grateful.”

Freed said, ”lt gives me a lot of
pride to see people’ buying» T-
shirts supporting a Pitt [alumna]
who needed a liver transplant. I
think that is great.” ,

full
accrediting

By Michelle L. O'Brien

Staff Writer

Six months after a recom- A
mendation that its accredita-
tion be revoked, the masters of
public administration program
at the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs
has proven itself and main-
tained full accreditation.

The National Association of
Schools of Public Affairs and
Administration recommended
the suspension of accredita-
tion for the MPA program in
June 1988 because . of or-
ganizational and procedural
problems within GSPIA.

Pitt, led by GSPIA Dean Da-
vis Bobrow, appealed the
recommendation to the
NASPAA Commission on Peer
-Review and Accreditation.
The appeals board reversed
the recommendation and
awarded full accreditation to
the program through June of
1993. '

The MPA program main-

tained its accreditation

throughout the appeals

process. 
Dean Bobrow said,

Germany fights image

By Kevin Costelloe
Associated Press Writer

FRANKFURT, West Germany

' — Charges that West German

companies helped Libya build
what may be a poison gas plant
recall horrors from two world
wars and images of what a poli-
tician called the ’’evil, self-
deceiving German.”

Germany shocked the world in
World War I by wiping out 5,000
Allied soldiers on April 22, 1915,
with chlorine gas, introducing the
era of chemical warfare. The Na-
zis later used Zyklon B gas to kill
millions of prisoners, most of

them Jews, at the Auschwitz ,

death camp.
In addition to lessons of the
past, the current debate dwells on

I moralstandards in a nation that

- has developed an arms export in-

dustry in the last 15 years that

ranks fifth in the world.
”German profits have grown

much more quickly than ethical

standards," said the Rev. Fried-V

helm Hengsbach, a social
sciences professor at St. Georgen
theological university in
Frankfurt.

”The Germans are very smart
in the sense of economic realities,
but they're not that shrewd when

it comes to ethical responsibility.

and political realities,” the

51-year-old Jesuit priest said in an '

interview.

Norbert Gansel, a member of‘
Parliament for the opposition So- '

cia_l Democrats, put the problem
succinctly: ”Now, our history has

Bush cautious in praise of Soviet Union reformsé

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ Presi-
dent Bush Wednesday credited
the Soviet Union with ”definite
improvement” in human rights
but said the United States will
watch what develops in the

’ months ahead while weighing

the decision whether to carry
through on a promise to attend a
Moscow summit on human rights
in 1991.

”I think we need to look for
performance, and there will be
time in which to see performance
in that regard,” he said. He add-
ed ”there has been definite im-
provement in some ways there,

, but let's see what develops as we

move toward that conference
date.”

White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was
not backing away from a commit-
ment to attend the Moscow con-
ference but said, ”There’s plenty
of room for independent analy-
sis” between now and 1991.

Bush made his comments in an
interview with two reporters as
part of a White House experi-
ment to make the president avail-
able. to the news media in

1 different forums. A transcript of

the session was made public.

The president hinted he may
visit China next month after stop-
ping in Japan for the Feb. 24
funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
”Stay tuned,” he said. ”We may
have something on that  yea or
nay before the close of business
today [Wednesday], but I just
don't know yet."

There also is speculation that
Bush will visit South Korea while
in the Far East.

On other subjects, Bush said:

0 He does not want the Feder-
al Reserve Board to act too
strongly to bring down inflation
rates. Fed Chairman Alan Green-
span said Tuesday that inflation
was too high and he would press
to reduce it.

While noting that he had not
talked with Greenspan recently,
Bush applauded the upward
movement in the stock market
and said ”there’s no signals out
there in the markets that this
economy is in real trouble.  I
don't want to see us move so
strongly against fear of inflation
that we impede growth.”

0 The administration is con-

sidering imposing a fee on cus-
tomers of savings and loan
institutions to help the federal
government pay to insure the
troubled S&L industry. ”That’s
one option,” he said, adding that
the idea had not been presented
as a formal recommendation.
”And so I'm not going to say
what I'm going to do but that is
one option."

0 He is not considering drop-
ping Dr. Louis W. Sullivan as his
candidate to head the department
of Health and Human Services.
Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
said some senators who have met
with Sullivan report that the
nominee personally supports the
Supreme Court decision that
legalized abortion — a view
different from that of Bush, who

says he wants the decision:

reversed.

However, Bush said, ”He has
supported my position 100
percent.”

Subpoenas issued in
Iran-Contra hearings

WASHINGTON (AP) + Attor-
neys for fired National Security
Council aide Oliver L. North dis-
closed Wednesday that they have
issued subpoenas in the Iran-
Contra case to three House com-

, mittees and two members of the

House.

North attorney Barry Simon
said the subpoenas were sent to
the House Intelligence, Foreign
Affairs and Armed Services com-
mittees.

The two members of Congress
were not identified. Defense sub-
poenas also were issued for two
unidentified House staff
members.

The House, through the gener-
al counsel to the clerk, subse-
quently moved to quash portions
of the subpoenas to the commit-
tees. A 22—page court brief said
the panels could» not allow the
”wholesale rummaging through
the records of the House” sought
by North's lawyers.

North's subpoenas require
”surrender of the broadest im-
aginable range of privileged
documents,” including ”the
whole set of records” for the

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras
(AP) — A former armed forces
chief who helped the Reagan ad-

Nicaraguan Contra rebel forces in
Honduras was ambushed and
killed Wednesday, officials and

- witnesses said.

Salvador Lobo, director of
emergencies at the State Hospi-

Gustavo Alvarez Martinez died of

Witnesses said six gunmen
waited for Alvarez Martinez out-

Cordova.

Campus ban on beer
kegs lifted at UPenn

PHILADELPHIA (AP) ~— There
is no longer a campus ban on
beer kegs at the University of
Pennsylvania.

But there are still some restric-
tions on alcohol consumption as
part of a compromise to end a
dispute between students and ad-
ministrators. I

William Epstein, aide to univer-
sity President Sheldon Hackney,
said the new policy, which was
recommended by the president
and unanimously approved last

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 26, I989

week by the school's University
Council, an advisory group, went

' into effect Tuesday.

The prohibition on kegs at
fraternity and sorority houses was
imposed last fall. Now, organiza-

tions can hold keg parties, but all ‘

campus groups must have ad-
ministrative approval before plan-
ning parties with alcohol.

In addition, groups must desig-
nate a person who is of legal
drinking age — at least 21 in

Pennsylvania —— as the official

host at any party where alcohol
is served. They must also require
identification before drinkers are
served and offer non-alcoholic
beverages at parties. I

Epstein said the policy revision
met the concerns raised by stu-
dents, staff and alumni while
maintaining ‘compliance with a
new state law, which took effect
in May. I -

Under the law, a university can
be held liable for furnishing alco-

'hol to minors if underage drink-

ing occurs on property owned or
controlled by the university.

Garrett Reismari, president of
Penn's lntrafraternity Council,
said Tuesday that fraternities
were ”thrilled” with the lifting of
the keg ban, which he said was
formulated by the university's
lawyers last summer without in-
put from student groups.

He said the ban had forced
drinking underground, increased
use of hard alcohol, which was
not banned, and fostered off-
campus beer blasts.

Air pollution levels

day dropped to safe levels.

A monitoring‘ station in Oak— '

those were steadily dropping,

Germany  

Continued from page 1
self-deceiving German is back.”

In its current issue, the left-
leaning magazine, Der Spiegel,
said the attitude of West German
industry is ”export at all costs” to

- guarantee prosperity at home and
”tens of thousands of people pay
for the exporters’ prosperity with
their lives.”

”First comes the food, and then
morals?” it said, referring to a line
by the -German author Bertolt

-6 Brecht. ”Not even that: many

deals are made completely
without morals.” _

Government statistics say West
German companies legally sell
about $16.6 billion worth of
guns, submarines, munitions and
other arms overseas each year.
That puts the country in fifth
place behind the United States,
Soviet Union, France and Britain.

Several state and local investi-

‘ gations are under way to deter-

6 mine the amount of arms and

arms-related goods sent abroad
illegally.
Included are inquiries into

reports of West German involve-
ment in Iraqi poison gas produc-
tion in addition to allegations that
West German companies helped
build the plant at Rabta, south of
Tripoli, that Libya says makes
medicines and the United States
says is for producing chemical
weapons.

Iraq acknowledged using poi-

‘ son gas during its war with Iran,

in which a cease-fire was reached
in August, and has been accused
of using it on minority Kurds.

Reports arise frequently of
West German companies evad-
ing export restrictions, as Gansel
reminded a noisy parliamentary
debate on the Libyan matter last
week.

”The string of arms-export
scandals is long,’’ he declared, in-
cluding sales of sensitive nuclear

technology to Pakistan, India and ‘
‘South Africa.

Gansel, 48, said Zyklon B gas
killed ”countless defenseless
Jews” and reminded fellow legis-
lators the image of the ”evil, self-
deceiving German” had become

a theme for both newspaper car-
toons and editorials.
Many newspaper stories, maga-

‘zine articles and TV programs

about the chemical plant scandal
point out the German history of
poison gas dating to World War I.

In Munich, the Suedeutsche
Zeitung reminded readers in an
editorial Jan. 13: ”Not everyone
may like the Germans; no one
has forgotten their past. Whoever
has as much power as the Feder-
al Republic must also bear
responsibility.”

Joachim Perels, a political
science teacher at Hanover
University, said in an interview:
”It is a question of current—day
morality and the Nazi past. You
just can't lose sight of that second
point. It would be better if West

Germany didn't supply Libya
with any materials that could be
used for war.”

Friedrich Justus Perels, the
professor's father, was executed
by the Nazis along with thou-
sands of others for alleged in-
volvement in the unsuccessful
attempt to kill Adolf Hitler in
1944. ,

Michel Friedman, spokesman
for Frankfurt’s Jewish communi-
ty, said of the Libyan scandal:
”German companies should be
more conscious of what's taking
place in Libya,” an enemy of Is-
rael. ”It’s part of the special
responsibility of the Germans,

and a special responsibility isn't

just something to pray about on
Sundays.”
Andreas Hillgruber, a conser-

vative historian on the Universi- .

ty of Cologne faculty, said
attempts to link the scandal with
the Nazi era are an example'”of
the past that won't go away." '

”You can view everything that
the Germans do today against
that background,” Hillgruber
said. _

Hillgruber and other conserva-
tive historians have tried to com-
pare the extermination of 6
million Jews with other atrocities

to show that Nazi genocide does"

not stand alone in history.

Bush's concern about

ethics a nice change Lobbyists have s

With the shadow of Iran-Contra looming over him,
George Bush is having the Office of Government Ethics
brief all his senior administrative officials on ”moral prin-

ciples and practices.”

Bush seems to be making an effort to follow up his in-
augural address, in which he said, ”Use power to help
people.'We are not the sum of our possessions  We can-
not hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger

bank account ...”

The differences between Reagan and Bush are becom-

. ing more apparent as the new president seems to be seek-

ing to unite his cabinet and establish a higher standard

‘ sof ethical responsibility.

After a Reagan administration tarnished with the repu-
tation of a ”sleaze factor,” where there were many accu-
sations of wrongdoing and unethical conduct, Bush

' appears to be trying to ensure that such a problem will

not occur duringhis administration. By emphasizing ethics
and turning away from Reagan's tacit approval of selfish-
ness, Bush is already working on solving one of Reagan's
biggest problems: corruption. I

The actions of the Meeses and the Poindexters look to

future Iran-Contra scandals by creating a ”responsible ex-

Let’s hope he can keep it that way.“

It hasn’t been an exactly harsh

. winter here in Pittsburgh, but it

is cold enough for the electric
blanket on some nights. Last
Thursday night was one of those
evenings on which I would have

' used it, had I slept in bed instead

of sleeping outside.
No, I wasn't camping or. run-
ning around the woods. I was at

the shanty for the homeless that
was set up by the Student Action .

union at Pitt.

I have a feeling I know what‘

most of your reactions will be. To
sum it up, ”Why?” My roommate
said to me as I was leaving the
apartment. ”Why are you going

{out in thewinter? I'd go with you

if it were spring or summer, but
it's too cold.”

.”Exactly!” I said. ”We have a
choice, but the homeless don't
get to choose between sleeping
outside or staying inside in the

warmth.”

“Do they?” my . roommate

' posed, insinuatingthat they did
 . - have a choice. ”Why arenft they
‘  at theshelters?” ~  ‘

_ Hmmm... that was a valid

’ ,Cgp.oint,t. and one that I couldn't,

readily argue. ”I’|| tell you tomor-

row,” I answered, and she shook —
her head as my friend Cheryl and

I left for campus.

" When I arrived around mid-4

night, there were about six peo-
ple there, two of whom were
homeless. I introduced myself
and my friend and then sat down,
ready to assume the role of a
homeless person for a night.

Jay Katz, the president of SAU,
was asleep at the time, so I talked
to Jeff Ayres, the vice president,
about why this was being done.

"Visibility. We need to educate
people about who the homeless
are, and the fact that they need
to be protected,” Jeff said.

That sounded good to me. I
had never been homeless, and it
would be interesting to find_out
why there is such a problem. We,

being people who have never ~-
been in a situation where we’

were without a home, are subject
to believing a lot of myths as to
why these problems exist. Some
of them being that the homeless
are lazy, alcoholics, drug addicts,
etc. . »

 Well the truth is. as I disco‘-

What kind of big changes are
going on in Washington now that
we have a new president?

I dropped in to see the lawyer-
lobbyist, Norton Nesbitt, the day
after the inauguration. He was

. removing all the photographs of

the Reagan appointees and
replacing them with autographed
pictures of Bush people.

' ”Redecorati_ng the office?” I
asked.

”Just changing the decor a lit-

tle,” he replied. ”You get tired
looking at the same faces all the
time." ,_=‘~

”You’re not throwing an auto-
graphed picture of Ed Meese in

the trash can, are you?”

”What kind of a friend do you
think I am? I'm taking it home

' and putting it in the bathroom. Ed

was good to me. He always took
my calls.”

”I notice that you have a big
gap where you used to have an
autographed photo of Ronald
Reagan."

”Yeh, I decided to take Ronnie
down and put him in the store
room so that no one will steal

vered after I spoke with some of

the homeless at the shanty, that
these sorts of problems do exist.

_ But show me a,class in society

where there aren't problems such
as this, I thought. But it is not

‘necessarily valid to assume that

all homeless people are drug ad-
dicts or alcoholics.

I wanted to know who these
people were. One of the men
there, whose name was ”Reg,”
was a veteran of the Korean War
and at one time» worked for the
state penitentiary.

”How did you wind up on the
streets?” I asked.

”I had a good job, but I was go-
ing through a rough divorce, and
I don't know how it happened,

_ but I just wound up not having a

house, any money, or a place to
go,” Reg said. He then told me
how he lived underneath a bridge
in Pittsburgh for eight months un-
til he got a‘ full-time job and was

_ able to get a home. He was par-v

him.” _

”Who are you planning to put
in his spot?”

”I’m waiting for a picture of the
big guy.”

”You mean President Bush?”

Nesbitt said, ”I could kill my-
self. I had thousands of opportu-
nities to have my picture taken
with him when he was vice presi-
dent. I remember one time I was
at the New Jersey State Fair for
the crowning of Miss Bergen
County, and George wanted to
get a photo with me. I turned him
down and went off to get myself
a beer.”

’’I just hope for your sake that -

Bush doesn't remember that you
walked away from him.”

”I doubt it. People were doing
it to him all the time. I have some-
one in the White House working
on an autographed picture of the
prez right now. They owe me for
all ‘the money I raised for the

ticipating at the Pitt shanty to
show his support of the efforts by
the SAU.

Reg also spoke of other vets
who were homeless because they

—weren’t able work well in society

after returning to the states (he
spoke of one particular veteran of
the Vietnam War when using this
as an example). ~

A big concern of those at the
shanty was how the homeless are
looked upon by people who do
have a place to live. Even while
we were sitting there talking, a
group of_ people drove by in a car
and shouted, ”Penn State rules
and the homeless suck!” and
then, around two in the morning,_
the bars all closed and a crop of
belligerents also made various
comments of ”Get a job!” or ”I
work, why don't you?”

It's hard when people have the
sorts of attitudes mentioned
above, because it's virtually im-
possible to clear up the myths dis-
cussed above. At the very least,
they could have stopped by and
talked to the people staying. in the
shanty. _ -

party in Michigan." 

”Nesbitt, people will think of
you as a good lobbyist whether .
you have a photo with the presi-
dent or not.”

”That may be true of "those who
know me, but what about the
potential clients who don't? They
will only judge me on the basis
of whose picture I have hanging
on the wall. This is a dog-eat-dog
business, and the reason that they
hire you is because they think
you have access to the top dogs.”

”I guess once they're out of
power there is no reason to keep
in touch with the Reagan people
anymore.” .

’’Some folks may feel that way
— but I don't. Those I dealt_with
during the Reagan years are still
my friends —- regardless of what
they are doing now.”

- Nesbitt’s secretary came up to
him and said, ”George Shultz is
on the phone.”

”Well, for‘God's sake, don't
tell him I'm here.” He turned to
me, ”The man thinks I have noth-
ing to do but chat with him on
the phone.” I

ne word isn't enughtodescribe the homeless

It was bitterly cold that night, .

and I could only sleep for about
an hour. When I woke up, the
other participants were up dis-
cussing the big event of the day,
the inauguration of George Bush
and Dan Quayle. ‘We spoke of
the $25 million dollar party that
would held that evening and how

much that money could help the

homeless effort.
When I first went out ‘to the
shanty, I thought I had a pretty.
good idea as to why I was doing
it; but after the night was over, I
realized I had learned a lot more
than I bargained for. I'm not ad-
vocating or justifying anything,
just saying that I was happy to
learn about something I had
never experienced. -

Continued from page 8

For those about to slam,
however, Naked Raygun salutes
you. Their raw, Chicago power
pop is more than famous among
scenesters in the know, on equal
footing with, say, Government Is-
sue or Bad Brains. /ettison is their
third full LP, setting the pace for
the new era of melodic punk
rock, where it is appropriate to
sing along with the whoa-whoa
chorus on songs like ”Soldier’s
Requiem” and the previous al-
bum’s ”Home of the Brave.”

No safe mosh supervisor is
needed, just an ambitious urge to
rock ’n’ roll. In other words,
Naked Raygun are for you.

Opening up for this death-
defyingdouble bill are the nota-
ble newcomers known as Bitch
Magnet. Hailing from Oberlin,
Ohio, where some of their mem-
bers are active at the college sta-
tion‘WOBC, they serve to meld
the styles of the other two bands
into a melodic noise—unit. ‘

Star Booty, the trio's recent I
debut LP (they have made cas— -

settes), was released on their own
Roman Candle label and
produced by the Rape Man him-
self, Steve Albini. This vinyl cause
for celebration begins and ends
with distorted waves of guitar,

‘while Sooyoung Park's vocals

creep slowly in the background.
Bitch Magnet are certainly des-
tined to follow the success of
other Ohioans such»as Scrawl
and My Dad Is Dead.

So now you know what it all
sounds like. If that isn't reason
enough to rush to Winterblast,
take this little fact into consider-
ation —- $3. Yes, three bucks is all
it takes for anyone with any sort
of college |.D. to gain admittance
to the show, pretty much the
most incredible bargain ever con-
ceived. For regular, non-aca-
demic-type folks, it's only $5, and
all ages are welcome.

Winterblast promises to be the
biggest concert of the season and
may portend well for the possibil-
ity of many future alternative
music eventsin Pittsburgh and

   
  

the foundation of a positive-
scene. Don't miss your chance to .
be a part of history. -
Winterblast begins at 9 p.m.
Friday in the Skibo Ballroom 0

see a ”play,” and now their ears
reverberated with noise, that rock
’n’ roll garbage. _

Painting It Red holds a surprise

‘for theater goers who usually be-

come fidgety after the first inter-

'mission. This ”concertplay”

skillfully coordinates monologue,
dialogue and entertaining num-
bers by a live rock band.

Utilizing a relatively small cast
(four performers and a three-
piece band), Director/writer
Steven Dietz, assisted by Leslie
Ball, has created an intimate look
into the trying world of the 19805
singles scene/.

Liz, played by Leslie Ball, who
also doubles as the lyricist, finds
herself thrust into the drudgery‘ of

_ singles life after her breakup with

a snobby restaurant critic, Eric,
played by Whit MacLaughlin.
MacLaughlin also plays William,
an eccentric chimney sweep who
is Liz's unsuccessful blind date.

Danni (Peggy Sanders) and Roy

ber. These people had come to

NC

   

‘%~

(John Hall) are two of Liz's
friends, who help console her
and try to resurrect her social life.

Painting It Red's band is com-
posed of Phil Harris (guitar), D.
Holbrook Duer (bass) and David
Klug (drums), all Pittsburgh—area
musicians. They perform upbeat
pieces combining jazz, blues and
straightforward rock. Each piece
parallels the moods of the play.

The unusual concept of inter-
spersing the movements of the
play with musical performances
keeps Painting It Red rolling from
one scene to the next. The.dia—
logue is funny, as well as realis-

    

tic, and it would surely stand on_

its own, but the band is a definite
plus, extra insurance against mo-
notony. _

Deitz deals with today's rela-
tionships with stunning verity.
Anyone who has ever been
dumped, on a botched blind
date, or had friends trying to
make amends will relate to the

will be two of America's most
outrageous comedians.

, Gilbert Gottfried is the same bi-

zarre, energetic comedian you
noticed in Beverly Hills Cop 2
(the accountant), and on count-
less promotional spots on MTV.
Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., his first
performances were as a teenager
doing stand—up comedy in the

Greenwich Village section of

New York City.
A few of Gilbert's many suc-
cesses include being a cast mem-

ber, along with Eddie Murphy

‘and Joe Piscopo, on Saturday

Night Live, from 1980-81, a fea-

tured spot on two Cinemax spe-«

cials, Caught in the Act and
Greetings from Gilbert; and he
was, as many agree, the funniest
cast member on the nationally

syndicated show Th/'cl<e of the
Night.

He was awarded, twice, the ex-
clusive Charlie Award (named af-
ter Charlie Chaplin) as Best Male
Comedian in New York. Recent-
ly, he was a guest host on Friday
Night Videos and on Max
Headroom. His bizarre, off-beat
humor captivates, hitting his au-
dience with a dynamic force.

Pittsburgh's funnyman, Shang

to leave you in ”stitches.” Per-
forming at such local clubs as the
Pittsburgh Comedy Club, Graffi-

The dreamy life of Spaniard
Salvador Dali finally ended Mon-
day at age 84. Dali was the most
controversial of the surrealist
painters and the last survivor of
the great Spanish art trio which
included Pablo Picasso and Joan
Miro.

Some will remember him more

for his flamboyant behavior and
publicity genius than hiswork.
But the startling nightmare world
he brought to the canvas remains
one of the unforgettable ex-
periences in modern art. 1
Dali is largely responsible for
the immense popularity of sur-
realism, the movement of the
1920s and 1930s which delved
into the subconscious mind. Us-
ing the grotesque quality, of

dreams, the surrealists tried to
bring out man's inner torment.
Surrealism began as a move—
ment in painting and literature.
Today it can be found throughout
pop culture: from the films of

David Lynch to the comic rou-_

tines of Steven Wright to the rock
lyrics of Robyn Hitchcock.
Dali's subject was his imagina-
tion. Lifelong obsessions with
sex, violence and paranoia be-

in memorium

came vibrant, hostile fantasies.
Dali took the bleak Catalonian
landscape of his youth and popu-
lated it with his shocking images.

In one of his early works, Ac-
commodation of Desire (1929),_
he depicted a roaring lion's head
transforming into ‘a circle of
rocks. In Inventions of Monsters
(1937), he drew himself and his
wife Gala amidst pale, lascivious
nudes and a flaming giraffe.

He often put commonplace ob-

An example of this is his master-
piece, The Persistence of
Memory (1931), which shows

',droopy clocks and an insect-

ridden stopwatch at the edge of
an endless desert. ’ '

This sensationalistic dream-
world also foundits way into the
motion picture medium.‘ His

, 1928 movie, An Andalusian Dog,

is considered a landmark in film
history. Its most famous image is
a human eye slashed open by a
razor. In Alfred Hitchcock's Spell-
'bound,'Dali created the sets for
Gregory Peck’s climactic dream

. sequence. -

Pampered by his parents, Da-
li’s eccentricity revealed itself at
an early age. As -a child he wore
a crown and ermine cape. In
1926, he was expelled from his
art school for arrogance. Dis-
covering Freud's writings on
dreams and the subconcsious
was a revelation in Dali's life.‘
Shortly afterward came his
greatest years of work, lasting
from the late-1920s,until the
mid-19305.

In 1929, Dali became a mem-
ber of the surrealist group which
was centered in Paris under the
leadership of writer Andre Bre-
ton. Breton once said, ”During
three of four years, Dali was the
living example of the surrealist
spirit, and he made it shine in all
its splendor.” Also during this
time, Dali met Gala Eluard, the
wife of surrealist writer Paul‘_Elu—
ard. Gala married Dali and be-
came his lifelong inspiration.

ype.
Everything from his showy man-
ner to his famous waxed
moustache attracted attention as
well as created detractors. The
surrealists eventually expelled

   

- him for his pomposity and con-

servative political views.
In the late 1930s, Dali turned

‘ away from surrealism in favor of
-a more classical style. By the
 19505, Roman Catholic themes

had become more prominent,

centering around the enigma of

Christ.‘

After the death of his wife in
1982, Dali was unhappy and be.-
came a recluse. Shortly before dy-
.ing,- he painted a message to his
dead wife: ”Wait for me! I'm
coming!’.’ ‘ -

Much of Dali's ’ work is
devalued because of fraud. The
artist himself-is to blame. He ad-
mitted to signing blank sheets of
paper in the 1960s. But this can-

notlmar the strange-beauty of his - «

legacy.-  .
‘ Shakespearewrote, ”We are

such stuff as dreams-are made‘ "
i on.” In his life and art, Dali took A .

these words to. heart.

The Hellenes lived it, Nietzche
interpreted it, and Iggy Pop ar-
ticulated it for a generation ot
kids: Raw power is a healing
hand.

The Heretics are the one Pitts-

burgh band that has consistent- I

ly and most honestly dived to the
dregs of human nature to tap

r‘~1F---1'w§~vu'r

"'»'¢zr=*""~t

  

that hysteric, electrochemical
darkness and return barely alive
with ultraloud guitars and
pounding drums to bear a
screaming witness to the cathar-
tic power of rock 'n' roll rage.

Didn't Waste Ne ‘lime

The Heretics self-titled first LP
recently hit the stores and sta-
tions. Wild Iive bands don't al-
ways sound great on vinyl, and
vice versa, but the Heretics seem
to pound out the best in both

worlds. The Heretics is a world-
class, hard-rockin', I<S—song

monster replete with loud, dual '

guitars; Stooge—y leads; cursed,
wild—man vocals; and clear,
pristine production.

The songs are quite melodic
and distinct (they're not all the
same chords played in E). ''Even
if one song reminds you of
another, I like to think that each

‘song has something special

about it," said Mike Michalski,
the band's guitarist.

_ He added, rather passionate-
ly, ''I'm good for about a song
a month. I lie awake every sin-
gle night worrying that I'll write
something that sounds like
another song. I don't play gui-
tar that well, and I don't care to
get any better, but it really piss-
es me olt to see a successful
band, who's played uitars IO
years more than me, p aying the
same chords over and over. I'm
preoccupied with variety."

Variety indeed! The tunes

Till New

Amazingly enough, the record
was rush-recorded in record
time and at minimum expense.
The Heretics recorded a record
a year ago which will never be
released. It cost over twice as
much money and took three

‘times as long, but they say it

sounded "wimpy." Ever
plagued with lineup troubles,
they couldn't go back in and
redo the songs, so they started
from scratch.

Like many Pittsburgh bands, "

the Heretics have had " ore
bass players and drummers than
The Pitt News has had writers,"
according to Michalski. Mike
and Steve Fabian are the origi-
nal members. Many drummers
who either were bad, couldn't

Continued from page 14

Mike Kolosar, formerly of the
Cynics.

Steve Fabian now drums. He
used to be Mike's alter ego on
guitar, but at a party this post
New Year's Eve, Steve found a
drum kit and walled away. He
called Rube, the group's singer,
the next day, and suggested
drumming.

Chris Kasporowski is the
band's new bass player, replac-
ing Brad Rogow from the LP and
Gregg Bloom from the single be-
fore it. Like Steve, she has only
been concentrating on her new
instrument for two weeks. Sur-
prisingly, she has never played
bass before, only guitar.

With all the previous problems
involving bad bass players,
muffing notes and missing cues,
the band agrees that Chris’
phrasing and speed (and
volume!) have earned her a per-
manent spot in the Heretic's tour-
van, a used ambulance. "ln a
way," she said, "the Heretics
are Pittsburgh's least-hated
band because of all the down-
‘falls they've had."

Rube, the band's ex—choirboy,
ex—army singer, joined the band
about a year ago.‘ His rough,
loud voice sounds like a cross
between Henry Rollins and
Grant Hart. He is the vocal
equivalent of Mike's Marshall
stack. .

The former five-piece lineups
caused a lot of problems, so
they now plan to stay with four.
"We're not going to replace
Steve with another guitarist be-
cause there is no replacement
for him." After their incendiary
_Metropol set, Mike came. up to
me, "Two weeks! They've only

, been playing for two weeks! lm-

*3 '80s Electric Banana scene as in-

51

"This it

’_agine» what-we'll-sound like -insix
months."
6 Now, with a permanent
lineup, the band feels like they
can finally go lOO percent.
"Never before have I felt like
it,’ " _said Rube.
Cily of Ihe Dogs
The lack of places to play in
town has been a hamperito the
Heretics. They all recall the early

spirational. They named Car-
sickness and The Five as bands
they used to see before the "big
freeze." Their regular crowd

‘ now is made up from a lot of

people from the old scene.
"Ourfollowing is small, but it's
loyal," said Michalski. "Some-
how we've acquired a reputa-
tion of not being team players,"
he continued, which seems to be
a very suspect criticism now that
Mike has been in the studio

producing -the Pleasureheads,’
Johnny Rhythm and. others, as A

well as running sound at the

legendary American Legion

1987 and '88.
The Curse
About the time:that the Heret-

shows of

ics released their first"single.,’

Search ’ and ~ Destroy/Lesbian
Grudge /Vlatc/1 at the end of
1987, they'd gained the repu-

tation of "the single loudest ele-
‘ ment in Pittsburgh." This muchis
not hyperbole: Pittsburgh Police‘

showed up at their Metropol

A show this post Tuesday and or-

deredthem to-turn down. .

But not all that's been ‘said
‘about .the Heretics is true.
They've also gained a reputa-
tion as 'club destroyers and fire-
starters. "Well," said Fabian,
"we did blow some fuses at one
place."

And the fact that the Heretics
are not a ubi uitous "rock

" "show" apparenty stems from

' , _. theirfallsezreputation rather than  

a non—team player attitude.
"Really, it's all politics and
money," said Michalski. "We'd
like to play with anyone. We
want to be the band that can
play anywhere. But we won't
kiss anybody's ass to get
booked."
Morning Sun

Fabian said that they "feel
held back here in Pittsbur h."
The Heretics have had aTwigh
playlist rating in college radio
stations around the country as
faraway as Hawaii and have
had overwhelming crowd
response in the places they've
traveled to, including all around
Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio
and West Virginia.

Now that they feel secure with
their current lineup, the band
agrees with Mike: '’If I could
spend all year on the road, l
would do it. We are definitely
always better received outside
of Pittsburgh."

I.ivin' Fast and Soon

The Heretics say they're
ready to do a new record as
soon as possible. They're plan-
ning on. working with the new
lineup to polish up the songs
they know and get ready to tour
when Skyclad, their distributing
label, gets their record out
around the country. They expect
the LP, like their single, to reach
the continents of Europe and
Australia. _

You Don’! Know

‘Still, like the proverbial

prophet, the Heretics are not
well received in their home. The
crowds‘seem to go for more
conservative music and places:
safe pop, safe rock, safe looks.-
"l can't get over how people
who see other bands think that
they're so sexy. They don't

-<»know‘wh'-at is sexy about mus-~ -

ic," said Chris.
Steve added, "They don't
know what is. '
"We lust want to write a var-
iety of really good songs and
play them really loud," said

. Mike. "Other bands have great

songs, but they play them too
wimpy. ..." ,

Like the lg sang, Raw Power is
a hea/ing hand; can you fee/ it?

7 Seconds had their beginning
way back in 1979 (They were
really young!) in the straight-
edged genre with Minor Threat.
Both bands played stop-and-go,
hardcore riffs with underlying
themes of anti-drugs, anti-alcohol
and anti-discrimination.

The band includes found-
ers/brothers Kevin ”Seconds”
Marvelli (vocals) and Steve
”Youth” Marvelli (bass), accom-
panied by Troy Mowat (longtime
drummer) and Bobby Adams
(guitar).

Their hardcore projects came
to -an abrupt halt with the 1986
release of New Wind. The
straight-edge ethic remained

_ strong, but their fast and furious

music had been replaced with
melodic rock ’n’ roll. Twinges of
their punk roots surfaced occa-
sionally.

The ”new” 7 Seconds have
been compared to U2 by writers
more times than anyone cares to
recall, but the fact remains that
they have picked up a milder,
new—wave sound.

Long-standing hardcore fans
were shocked and disgruntled by
the band's change. 7 Seconds’
move seemed to be wimpy, the
ultimate sellout, and selling out

I in the hardcore business is a fate

worse than death.

But 7 Seconds didn't die. They
went on to release another EP
and two more LPs, including their

» most recent, Ourselves.

Sure, they lost some of their

original following, but many die-

hard fans made sense of the
change and stuck around. The
band was greeted by an entirely
new group of listeners as well.
The shocking change seems to
pale when you look closely at 7
Seconds’ past work. Not only
were they brave enough to sport
the often downtrodden, straight-
edge image, but they also sang
about love. ”Trust” was hard-
core’s first serious love epic. They
sang about treating women with

respect, a move that can be
credited for the band's large fe-
male following, even before they
broke the hardcore mold. (Not
many women enjoy hardcore.)

7 Secondslhave bridged the
gap and crossed over to a whole
new scene. Their change has ena-
bled an even larger audience to
come into Contact with the
band's ideology.

After all, hardcore, even with
its powerful messages and severi-

ty, has always had a limited ac-
cessibility. It takes a lot of
persistence and sacrifice to grasp
hardcore. Persistence that many
people are not willing to deal
with.

This is not to say that 7 Seconds
fans are any less devoted; the
band has simply slowed down a
bit, making their messages easi-
er to comprehend.

7 Seconds have always pro-
duced intelligent lyrics, and their

”new wind” projects are no ex-
ception. Smart, thoughtful lyrics
carry the band over any musical
shortcomings they may have en-
countered in switching styles.

Ourselves takes 7 Seconds’ dis-
tinctive ”new sound” to a higher
level. They've left the hardcore
scene in their past, opting for a
refreshing, upbeat, rocking
sound.

Ourselves has also proved to
be a benchmark for the band.
They seem to have settled in af-
ter the move, something which
may account for the consistency
of the album.

7 Seconds have paid their dues
in the past, taken a brave step
toward change, and are now
reveling in some well-deserved

Panthers
dispose of
Pirates,
82-79

By Tom Conavan

6 AP Sports Writer

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —
Paul Evans probably doesn't want
an entire slate of games against
Top 10 teams, but playing the
best in the nation has brought out
the best in Pitt in January. A

Jason Matthews scored all 15 of
his points in the second half and
hit two go-ahead free throws with
1:28 to play as Pitt scored its third
upset of the month by knocking
off No. 9 Seton Hall 82-79 Wed-
nesday night.

Earlier this month, the Pan-
thers, 10-7, defeated then—No. 2
Syracuse'91-86 and followed that
with a 99-91 victory over No. 3
Oklahoma. -

”Look around,” Evans said.
’-’Most teams don't have all five

5 7' starters play well at one time. We

don't have a bench. We need all
five starters to play well. When
we do, we can compete with
anybody/’

Evans’ starters didn't play all
that well against Seton Hall, 17-2,
but they were at their best in the

final 5:41 when the Panthers ral-

lied from a seven-point deficit.

 ”We’re a young team, but we
never gave up,” Matthews said. '

”We never quit. I don't know
what it-is. Maybe somewhere
down deep we say to ourselves
we're going to beat the Top 10
teams.

Pitt held Seton Hall to just one
field goal in the final seven
minutes in breaking the Pirates’
seven—game winning streak at the

, Brendan Byrne Arena.

’’I thought when it mattered,
they made the plays and we
didn’t,” Seton Hall coach P.J.
Carlesimo said. ”That may be
simplifying it a lot. I thought we
had our chances. I didn't think
we had breakdowns.”

Trailing‘ 70-63, Brain Shorter hit
two free throws to ignite a 9-0 run
that forward Bobby Martin
capped with layup for a 72-70 Pitt
lead. Ramon Ramos then hit two
free throws and banked in a
10-footer to put Seton Hal-l ahead
74-72 with 2:41 to play in the Big
East game.

Sean Miller tied the game with
a 17-foot jumper from the left
baseline, and after Michael Coop-
er missed the front end of a one-
and-one for Seton Hall, Matthews
put the Panthers ahead for good
with his two free throws.

Darelle Porter followed with a
12-foot jumper to extend the lead
to four points with 29 seconds to
go. .
In the final seconds, Gerald
Greene got Seton Hall within

79-78 before Matthews hit two J 4

free throws to make it 81-78.
Greene sank a free throw, but the
Panthers got the ball inbounds
and Martin hit a free -throw.

Seton Hall fell to 4-2 in the Big
East, while the Panthers are 3-3
in the conference.

Shorter topped Pitt with 22

A points and Rod Brookin had 15,

all in the first half.

Late victories give Pitt wrestlers
a 28-17 victory over Cleveland St.

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer '

Sparked by three pins, the Pitt
wrestling team pulled a late vic-
tory over the Cleveland State Vik-
ings by a 28-17 tally-last night at
Fitzgerald Field House.

The Panthers are currently.
7-1-1 on the season and 1-1 in
Eastern Wrestling League compe-
tition.

Pitt's Bob Simpson came out
on fire as he pinned Mike Elsass
at 3:52 in the first match of the
night and Pitt was up 6-0.

Pitt head coach Rande Stott-
lemyer said, ”Win or lose, Bob
creates momentum for the team;
that's what a 1 18 pounder is sup-
posed to do." ’

Simpson said, ’’I definitely
think I did my job tonight with
that pin and really helped the
team out.”.

One of the tougher matches of
the night for Pitt came in the 126
pound division as Panther Matt
Rizzo took on Guy Sako, who
had a substantial height advan-
tage. Rizzo lost by three points af-

,'ter it was all over, but was visibly

struggling the entire match.

Rizzo lost to Sakoin tourna-
ment competition earlier this year
1-0.

”The guys I've been wrestling
all year have~ been bigger than
me,” Rizzo said. ”I’m used to that
now, but tonight I think I made
a couple dumb mistakes and I

The biggest surprise of the
night came as Pat Santoro moved
up to 150 lbs. for this match to
wrestle number five ranked Dave
Wlodearz.

Santoro dominated the match
in a weight class in which he nor-
mally does not wrestle. The
defending national champion (at
142 pounds) showed his exper-

ll ‘ .

. ldefinitely think I did
my job tonight with

-tise while carrying an extra eight

pounds by pinning Wlodearz at
the 4:46 mark.

Santoro replaced struggling
Scott Hovan, who decided to sit
out last night's match. Alan Utter
replaced Santoro at 142 lbs. and
won his match 6-4. The weight
shifts did not hurt the Panthers at
all in the match. ‘

Stottlemyer said, ’’If Pat's not

an inspiration to somebody,’

they've got to be blind,” Stott-
lemyer said. ”He moved up to
wrestle a kid [\Nlodearz] whose
ranked fifth in the country in his
weight class and just ranhim into
the ground.” . .

lete compete, come up and
watch Pat Santoro.”

Pitt's Perry Miller (190 lbs.)
pulled out the final Panther pin
with the match tied at 17. Miller
pinned Ernie Slone at the 4:57
mark to put the Panthers up
23-17.

It was especially filling that
Miller won his match after the
disappointing loss against

Nebraska which could have won ‘

it for Pitt in the season opener.

’’I had a decent height advan-
tage and I think that might have
helped out a little bit,” Miller
said.

”Last year he [Slone] beat me
pretty bad,” Miller continued.

.lndeed, Miller lost by a techni-
cal fall (five match points) to
Slone last season.

Pitt wrestlingwas not without
it_’s problems, however. Bill Lewis
at 167, was destroyed 17-2 by
Viking Frank McKeon. _

Panther Brian Shaffer (134) lost
14-6, giving the Vikings a four
point major decision victory.

There are lessons to be learned
in losses, as Stottlemyer will at-
test to.

Panther Jeff Turner (158), ex-
pected to win his match, stubbed

his toe early on and struggled for -

about six minutes. Turner wound
up dropping a 7-4 decision to
Matt Peters.

’’I thought Jeff epitomized the
whole night,” Stottlemyer said.

Adams’ three-point streak is over [)any|uk__

By Bob McMahon

Associated Press Writer

I EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —
One of the NBA’s most incredi-
ble streaks ended before a half-
empty arena and against a strug-
gling team.

Michael Adams failed to con-
nect on a three-point shot for the
first time in 80 games, and his

. string was broken at 79.

For nearly one year, the
5-foot-10 Denver Nuggets guard
had launched his unorthodox
shots from afar with uncanny ac-
curacy. Just Saturday night, he hit
a league-tying eight three-

pointers against Milwaukee.

But that performance may have
burned him out. On Tuesday
night at the Brendan Byrne Are-
na, a streak begun on Jan. 28,
1988, ended as six Adams shots
banged far from the rim in a
117-115 loss to the New Jersey
Nets.

The Nets’ home court was the
only one Adams failed to master
during his streak. The end of the
streak was partly due to the cling-
ing coverage of guards Lester
Conner and John Bagley, and the
poor road play of the Nuggets,
according to both coaches.

Denver did not play in Boston,

Detroit or Charlotte during the

streak.
Nuggets Coach Doug Moe

seemed only vaguely aware of

the streak’s end.

”Our offense stunk. We stood
around and took jump shots in-
stead of moving the ball,’’ Moe
said. ”[Adams] had a bunch of
good shots at the three, but he
just couldn't hit them.”

Adams also seemed more con-
cerned about the team’s slump.

’’I had a number of shots, but
it just wasn't there tonight,” he
said. ”It had to end sometime.
I'm just glad I was able to enjoy
it while it lasted.”

Adams added, ”What I'd real-
ly like is a winning streak.”

The Nuggets, 20-20, have lost
four straight" games and nine

"straight on the road.

His record appears to be secure
for some time. Nuggets assistant
coach Allan Bristow has predict-
ed that ”nobody in our lifetime
is going to break this streak.”

Adams obliterated the previous
NBA three-point -record of 23
games, set by Boston's Danny
Ainge early last season.

During the 79 games, Adams
hit 193 of 530 three—pointers and
had a respectable percentage of

w,esﬂing_Lady Panthers pull two game split

Continued from page 19 _
posed to win, I was counting on
it. But he stubbed his toe and lost
it but not because of a lack of

effort.

”He went out, he fought hard
after he got behind and tried to
fight back. In my view, he really
didn't get beat. He just ran out of
time. I can live with losses like
that, when somebody’s putting
forth that kind of an effort.”

Pitt's next match is upcoming
this Saturday whenthey will take
on the Navy Middies at Fitzger-
ald Field House. They then trav-
el to Bloomsburg University next
Friday.

 

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

Pitt's women's basketball team
split its two games this past week,
beating St. John's 68-66 at Fitz-
gerald Field House Saturday after-
noon and losing to Seton Hall
83-69 on the winner's court Tues-
day night.

The Lady Panthers (9-9, 2-6 in
the Big East) put a solid first half
together against the Express and
held on in the second half to
come out with a hard-earned vic-
tory that snapped a seven-game
losing streak.

As seems to always be the case,
Pitt junior forward Lorri Johnson
got her team started, scoring 11
of the first 13 points for the Lady
Panthers. That jump start
propelled Pitt into a lead they
would relinquish only rarely the
rest of the way, and even those
few times St. John's pulled ahead,
the visitors never could gain even
the semblance of control over the
contest. .

The game also marked the
resurgence of Lady Panther
sophomore center Connie Hurt,
who dominated the inside game
for the first time this season, grab-

bing a career-high 13 rebounds
and notching 18 points.

In the past, Hurt had been in
head coach Kirk Bruce's prover-
bial doghouse, and at one point
earlier in the year, things got so
bad that Hurt was benched for
entire games. -

”Practice habits are what made
Connie play well,” Bruce stated.
”When she practices well, she
plays well; it's as simple as that.”

Hurt, ‘Johnson and company
faced a formidable task on Tues-
day, however, as they ran straight
into a tall Seton Hall contingent.
Despite the fact that Johnson
scored 26 points and Tabatha

Long added 13, the Lady Pan-
thers bowed to superior free-
throw shooting in the second half
and walked away from the court
with a 9-7 overall record.

Although his squad suffered a
tough road defeat at the hands of
a Big East opponent, Bruce still
felt that Pitt has sprung out of the
nadir that accompanied their
seven-game losing streak.

”We won one and we lost one,

but those two games were the _. -»
hardest ones we've played this '

year, in my opinion,” Bruce stat-
ed. ”But we have to play hard
like that in every game, or we're
going to lose.’’
