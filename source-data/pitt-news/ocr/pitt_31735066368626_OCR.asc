Reagan
Meets With
Enthusiasm
And Anger

By BRIAN BALK

Inside, sophisticated politically
minded partisans assembled in the
Pittsburgh Hilton to hear the ideals
of the nation's commander-in-chief
at a conference of dislocated
workers. After a luncheon of
chicken and red wine, the guests,
dubbed with name tags, listened
intently to the proposals and opin-

Inside, they were orderly, polite
and eager to listen.

Outside, the reality of the nation’s
No. l problem——unemployment—
waited in the form of 4,500 protes-
tors. It was a smaller number than
expected, these who gathered not to
hear plans for retraining the work
force. They were not concerned with
mingling with the right people. The)
were unemployed and furious.

The pouring rain did not inhibit

the protestors from jamming into '

the northern section of Point State
Park. If anything, the inclimate
weather heated their rage.

“All those people standing, get-
ting drenched in the rain showed a
sign of the seriousness of the prob-
lem,” Molly Rush, Director of the
Mertian Ministry of Justice and
Peace and a speaker at the rally,
said.

Though Michael Morgenstern’s
book is entitled “How To Make

Love To A Woman,” his message.

during his lecture last night was one
of romance and a return to feelings
instead of mere sexual encounters.

During his lecture, Morgenstern,
a writer and practicing attorney,
expressed the need for romance in
today's relationships between men
and women. Men are afraid to
express romance, and he believes his
book can help bring back a new kind
of romance.

“I wanted to find out what women
wanted and what they didn’t want:
the idea for the book came out of -a
situation in San Francisco where I
pulled out a seat for the woman I
was having lunch with and she had a
tantrum. She said I was being a
chauvinist and left the restaurant. It
made me question what was happen-
ing to -romance in the world,” Mor-

Author Urges Return To Romantic Sex

His research consisted of inter-
viewing over 200 women from
across the country about what their
most memorable romantic and sex-
ual experiences were. He also asked
what women wanted out of their
sexual experiences and most women
said that romance was lacking.

“Although my book deals with
such things as technique, the thing
I’m stressing is romance, the art of
making a woman feel important and
wanted," he said. “I'm not saying
you have to buy your girlfriend or
lover a rose every day, but the simple
act of courtesy is welcomed by
women.

When classes are over for the day
and you and your girlfriend are try-
ing to decide what to do, even
though you know exactly what you
really want to do, have something
else in mind. Even if it is a walk in the
park, she will appreciate the roman-
ticism of the act,” Morgenstern said.

As his ﬁrst book, Morgenstern
said that there were some complica-

tions invpublishing. ‘He said that

  Reagan Sees Retraining

As Answer To Problem

By PAUL CORREA

President Reagan called on Pitts-
burgh this Wednesday to address the

. unemployment issue, but not the

thousands of unemployed.

As a crowd -of protestors, esti-
mated to be as large as 4,500'by
Pittsburgh police, chanted their dis-
pleasure with Reagan, he spoke to a
more appreciative crowd inside the
Pittsburgh Hilton. Reagan chose to
address his administrations concern
with unemployment by speaking to
the National Conference on the Dis-
located Worker.

‘'1 came here not only as a speaker
but as a possible vi.C..tim-y-‘L-?Reagan
said as he began his speech. “A
number of Democrats would like to
see me dislocated."

The conference, sponsored by the
National Alliance of Business, dealt
with the problem of the “unem-
ployed worker who is unlikely to be
able to return to his previous or sim-
ilar occupation.”

Reagan did not offer any new
proposals at the conference. He did
use the occasion to underscore his
administration's concern about
unemployment, promote legislation
to retrain workers in the face of new
technology and attack the 1984
Democratic budget plan.

“I read through the “help wanted”
ads in The Pittsburgh Press and its
obvious why so many are frustrated
whenethey see jobs available,” Rea-
gan said to an audience composed of
labor and business leaders. “There
are a lot ofjobs in this paper and in

papers all across the country, but the
, jobs don’t always match the skills of
those who need the work.‘

Reagan read off some want ads
for jobs available in highly technical
areas——mostly computer-related.

“The permanently laid-off steel-
worker has never had the training
even to understand what the want

ads mean let alone apply for 

positions,” he said.

Before going to the Hilton, Rea-
gan toured the Control Data Insti-
tute where I35 unemployed people
are being retrained for jobs in the
computer undustry. After touring
the institute, located in the Alle-
gheny Center Mall, he turned to the
institute’s students and said “this is
going to date me alittle bit, but lean
tell you that I don‘t know a single
thing about what We just seen.’

Reagan said that this nation must 1

help those “who have to pay the
price of economic readjustment.’
He offered the Jobs Training Part-
nership Act as a way of helping the
unemployed readjust. Reagan
signed this act into law on Oct. I3,
1982. The act provides $240 million
to retrain an estimated l(X),0lll peo-
ple in I984. Pennsylvania would
receive between $6 to $8 million of
that amount.

Reagan promoted his proposal
for a “youth opportunity wage"at 25
percent lower than the regular $3.35
minimum wage.

“The old cliche that you can‘! get a
job until you have experience and
you can’t get experience until you
have a job is true for too many of our

tine’s, one of Oakland’s oldest bar
/restaurants, changed hands this
week.

Frankie Gustine, a former Pitts-
burgh Pirate star, turned control of
his lounge over to the owners of C. J.
Barney’s.

The new owners of this Oakland
landmark confirmed that the sale of
the nightclub had already taken
place; however, they refused to com-
ment on any possible changes at the
bar, saying their plans are not
definite.

The future of the bar is completely
undecided according to the owners,
who now control a maior part of the
Forbes Avenue block.

have held classes in the restaurant
and final exam papers have even
been dropped off there by profes-
sors. In addition, many campus
clubs and organizations hold their
meetings in the popular bar.

;~‘*What Did Reagan's Visit To Pittsburgh Accomplish?

H;

1 of; btirglj.”.?-

By JOHN HOUSTON

President Reagan's visit to Pitts-
burgh on Wednesday has received
extensive press coverage. It has been
referred to as the stop where Reagan
met his match. Many questions have
arisen as a result. While some people
think that the visit was a political
move, others feel that there was

me true meaning in his visit. The
answer probably lies somewhere in
between. _

This week's Forum focuses on the
visit and what it accomplished.

 ?
Professor Richard

Oestriecher,

Pitt History Department

Pitt history professor Richard Oes- ’
treicher wastpart of the demonstra- ,
Jtion that met in front of the Hilton

,7

Hotel. Oestreicher called the presi-
dent's trip here "a travesty."

"The image of his visit is like that of
his policy," he explained. "He comes
to a center of unemployment to talk
to the corporations." '

Oestreicher said he thinks Reagan
was only in Pittsburgh to assess pub-
lic reaction and that his visit did little
good.

The demonstration, however, was
a true indication of the sentiment of

the people, according to Oes- ’

treicher. He added the people at the
demonstration were "angered and
disgusted." '

Oestreicher said that Reagan is
compromising the social agreement
and is putting the power back in the
hands of big business, a move which
he said will lead to some sort of class
war in the end. He described Rea-
gan's policy as outmoded and said
that giving money back to big busi-
ness will not solve anything.

Professor Reuben
Slesinger,

Pitt Economics
Department

Reagan, he said, should put his
money into the economy instead of
defense. Reagan is only making a
token gesture to the unemployed by
giving so little to unemployment,

-according to Oestreicher.

young people, especially minori-
ties,” he said.

The reason too many teenagers
have difficulty in finding jobs is the
current minimum wage, he said,
adding that employers cannot afford
to pay the current minimum wage to
kids with no work experience.

“So to help young people find-
jobs, I‘ve proposed a youth oppor-
tunity wage,” Reagan said.

He added that young people don't
have to accept this amount and “I

.. know many young people will be

able to command more, but this new
wage will allow those who don't
have any work experience to make a
start in the work place.”

In an attempt to stifle criticisms he
has already received about this
proposal, Reagan said since this spe-
cial wage would only apply in the
summer, there would be no danger
of displacing current workers with
young people at lesser wages.

Reagan couldn’t leave Pittsburgh
without saying a word on the econ-
omy in general and attacking the

A Unemployment

Democrats. -
“The leading economic indicators

are positive, and I can tell you, so am ,

I,” he said.

‘ He went on to say that inﬂation
has been “knocked down to 0.4 per-
Cent in the last six months, the low-
est rate in nearly 22 years.
Unemployment, while still painfully
high, has decreased to 10.3 percent
from 10.8 percent peak in
December. If you count our men
and women in uniform as employed,
the rate is l0.l percent.”

The Democrats received a mild
tongue—lashing from the President.
Reagan said, “We have worked long
and hard for this recovery and we
are not going to see it shattered.” He
attacked‘ the Democrat’s budget
proposal saying their budget calls
for a $315 billion tax increase over
the next five years. According to
Reagan the Democrats are playing
politics with the budget again. He
said of the Democratic proposal “it
provides for a recovery all right‘-
the congress’s recovery of money
thaft: belongs to America's wage
eaiwriers and taxpayers.”

People, however, are blaming the
wrong person when they blame Rea-
gan, according to Pitt economics
professor Reuben Slesinger.

"People are blaming the wrong

- person because he [Reagan] has no

control over the steel problem," Sle-
singer said. "The Congress is the
place from where the changes have
to come."

Speaking abut the visit, Slesinger
said it was too short.

“The visit was a good-will gesture,"
he said, "and nothing but good will
was achieved."

The retraining program is not

worth it in the long run and is only a‘

token effort, Slesinger said. The
economy would not be able to
absorb the trainees if it were on a
large scale. Therefore, the number of
those who could be retrained is
limited, according to Slesinger.

 

 

Dr. Michael Johnston,
Pitt Political Science
Department

 

Dr. Michael Johnston, Pitt political
science professor, said Reagan did
not have much to say.

“I really don't know if his visit did
any good, and at most, it was a sym-
bolic gesture," Johnston said.

Reagan was making a grandstand
play when he accepted the resume
from the unemployed worker,
according to Johnston, and while
that person will get results, in reality,
others who are unemployed will not
benefit

Reagan, however, is not confront-
ing the issue, Johnston said.

‘By helping that one person, other
people will falsely believe that Rea-

gan isihelping," Johnston said. He

added that he hopes people will see
through Reagan's ploy and see what
Reagan is really doing or what he's
not doing.

“The work-training program is
only a short-term solution, and if we
stick with it, we will only have to
retrain the workers later," Johnston
explained. The only solution John-
ston said he sees is for people to get
a good liberal arts background so
that in the future the people can train

themselves rather than be depend- V‘

ent on this type of program. V
The demonstration truly voiced
the feelings of the public, or at least
those who are unemployed, accord-

ing to Johnston. And while Johnston ‘

said that Reaganomics is working, he
also said that jobs still may not
become available to the worker in the

future because of the increased use .

of machines.

Spﬁng
Pressures

It's gettingclose to ﬁnals week and tension builds

among Pitt students. Pitt is acknowledging finals by
throwing a “Spring Fling”. Most of the activities are
going to be held in Schenley Quadrangle, ignoring the
need to consider resident students.
, The purpose of Spring Fling, which includes soft-
ball, volleyball and rollerskating, is to relieve pressure
for students before finals begin. But it actually could
add to the pre-final pressure.

It should have occurred to those who planned and
approved this weekend for the Spring Fling that many

students who live in the Quad buildings will be study- -

ing for tests and that students could find the noise
made by Fling festivities to be disturbing.

This, however, is part of a greater problem.

Resident students wake every day to the sounds of
drills, trucks and construction workers. And this week
brought a new surprise to Quad residents: the invasion
by huge cement pourers and other various equipment
rolling through the Quad on the course ofa school
day.

Not only is the presence of such equipment unsafe
around so many students, but it is a gross inconsidera-
tion of the many students who must walk through the
Quad to get to class.

Students did not complain when the Quadrangle
entrance to the Student Union was closed because of
renovation, forcing them to walk a block and a half to
reach the next building over.

They also did not complain when the steps leading
from the Quad to the Cathedral of Learning were

blocked, also for the renovation, and passively _

accepted the fact that it would mean more
inconveniences.

The situation with Spring Fling, however, could be
more of a nuisance. Activities for this weekend include
broadcast by campus radio station WPGH in the
Quad daily, mud-wrestling in the Quad until 11 p.m.,
movies until Midnight in the Quad, etc.

Many professors insist on moving their final exams
to this Monday to “get them over with.” In addition,
students have paid and deserve peace and quiet in their
own rooms, especially for finals. '

Students have been putting up with noise in the
Quadrangle all semester and now, when they need
quiet for studying, which they came to college to do in
the first place, the University has overlooked this basic
need in favor of a ﬂing.

The Spring Fling is not a bad idea, but it means that
many students will be disturbed unneccessarily. A
compromise has not been proposed, but next year
more thought should be given to the Spring Fling and

I a students right to be left undisturbed.

The activities have been organized to relieve ten-
sion, but they will do little more than increase it.

Letters To The Editor

‘Buck Rogers’ Mentality

Dear Editor:

President Reagan’s appeal for
more research in space is a turning
point in his term as president, and as
a member of the National Space
Institute and the L5 Society, I am
glad to see The Pitt News give it
coverage (4/ l / 83).

The militarization of space is an
important issue that brings the
future closer to us. It cannot be dis-
missed lightly by calling it “Buck
Rodgers"; the same objections were
made against nuclear missiles,
weather and communications satel-
lites and the Apollo program. “It
could take 10 years” doesn’t hold
water either, as the Soviets are work-
ing on satellite weapons systems
now. (It should also be noted that
this same objection effectively ended
many high-tech proposals to make
the United States energy indepen-

dent in the early seventies. Had this
objection been ignored and the
research conducted, we would be
energy independent today in the
early 80s!)

If President Reagan is to be criti-
cized for his attitude towards space,
it should not be for wanting to use
space to maintain the balance of
power (perhaps “Ronald Raygun”
was prophecy as well as punl), but
rather for a relative lack of enthusi-
asm for the peaceful development
(commercialization, industrializa-
tion and eventually, the coloniza-
tion) of space.

For example, take the recent Jobs
Bill which Reagan touts as proof of
his commitment to help the unem-
ployed. According to Congressman
Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia), the
amount of money authorized by the
Jobs Bill could have purchased four

example, do you like biology?
The student will take his No. 2
pencil and respond by ﬁlling one
of four dots corresponding to
answers ranging from “not at all"
to “very much so." When the stu-
dent submits this form to the
computer, it will respond with
something like English major or
Psychj Business, perhaps even
transfer.

There will be no discussion of
what the student's career or edu-
cational goals are. The machine
will only know the student as a
number, and the entire process
will only take seven minutes.

The idea I am trying to get
across is that the advising center
at Pitt is run just this way-——
except the computers are peo-
ple. I don't know whom they are
trying to fool by callin.g_t_.h‘i.s. an
advising department; if is only so

Advising is an important part
of any educational institution.
Being a student in a large univer-
sity can leave a student quite con-
fused. A university offers many
options, and the student needs a
good quality source to which he
can refer about how the univer-
sity can help him achieve his
goals. This is especially crucial

when ii student’s goals are not
defined. Unfortunately, this is
where Pitt's advising department
is most lacking. Whoever organ-
izes our advising center here at
Pitt should realize that efficiency
is not first priority when it comes
to something as important as
advising.

Decision
On Duties
Hasty

Dear Editor:

President Reagan's recent deci-
sion to increase import duties from
4.4 percent to 45 percent on japa-
nese motorcycles of 700 ccs and
larger is a hasty maneuver that I
feel is worthy of more considera-
tion. While I am concerned about
the flood of foreign products and
their negative impact on our
unemployment rate and sagging

, economy, I really don‘t have any

sympathy for the Harley-Davidson
Motor Co. of Milwaukee. Harley-
Davidson has never made an effort
to effectively compete with the Jap-
anese motorcycle industry. Harley-
Davidson persists in churning out
overpriced, overweight, under-
powered and unreliable machines
based on an antiquated engine
design that has remained virtually
unchanged for the last 40 years.

I'm glad you wrote to me first! I have just discovered a sure-fire cure for
people with your problem. It is quick, easy, inexpensive, relatively safe, and

Dear Editor:

We feel that Mr. Andrews‘April 6
letter to The Pitt News contained
many unfounded and biased
generalizations.

Any student can participate in a
varsity sport, provided he has what

 takes. Each varsity sport within

 

 

the university has its own share of
“walk-ons," those students who try
out for a varsity team without ever
being directly recruited. There are
no restrictions on a student who
wants to be a walk-on athlete other
than maintaining a minimum 2.0
QPA; this includes freshmen, who
must have a 2.0 QPA out of high
school. '

So what is preventing more peo-
ple from becoming walk-ons? Per-
haps it's because of the demanding
schedule that a student-athlete must
handle. .

Q: Do non- or limited English-
speaking students have a right to
a bilingual education?

A: Yes, according to the
Supreme Court in Lau v.
Nichols, at least when there are a
substantial number of non- or
limited English-speaking stu-
dents who speak the same domi-
nant language.

Lau was a lawsuit filed on
behalf of l,800 Chinese-speaking
students who were being taught
only in English by the San Fran-
cisco school district. They
argued that they were being dis-
criminated against in violation of
the Fourteenth Amendment and
of Title VI ofthe Civil Rights Act
of 1964, which bans discrimina-
tion “based on the ground of
race, color or national origin” in
“any program or activity receiv-
ing Federal financial assistance."

The Supreme Court's decision
in Lau, although it was brought
on behalf of Chinese-speaking
students, has its greatest impact
in requiring bilingual education
for Spanish-speaking students,
members of the largest language
minority in the country.

Q: May jury commissioners
use source llsts for jurors, such as
voter registration or tax lists.
which underrepresent minori-
ties?

A: Yes and no. No source list
may be used for juror selection

Rights Of Minorities,

As for the statement that athletes
carry “negative QPA‘s," for every
example of an athlete who abuses
the academic system, (and let's face
it, there are a few individual who
attend college for the sole purpose of
playing sports or use college athlet-
ics as a stepping stone to the pros),
there are numerous examples of stu-
dents who benefited from participa-
tion in athletics.

Seldom do we hear of the athlete
who qualifies for NCAAs or makes
All-America. You only hear of the
few bad events indecently blown out
of proportion by the news media. If
only the media would give the same
publicity to the numerous student-
athletes who graduate each year, on
time, rather than sensationalize an
isolated incident of infrequent
occurence.

From the tone of his letter, it
sound as if Mr. Andrews has never
participated in a varsity sport other

which itself is discriminatory or
which fails reasonably to reﬂect a
cross-section of the population.
Thus, the use of segregated tax
digests in drawing grand and
trial jurors has been held to be
unconstitutional. By the same
standard, use of voter registra-
tion lists from which minorities
have been excluded should also
be unconstitutional. However,
without exception the courts
have approved the use of voter
lists, either as the sole or primary
source for jurors, even though
they underrepresent minorities
and even injurisdictions in which
there has been a long history of
discrimination in registering and
voting. The justification for use
of voter lists has been the practi-
cal one, that in spite of their deﬁ-
ciencies, they are probably the
most broadly based lists
available.

Q Are racial minorities
entitled to elect minority candi-
dates to office in proportion to
their presence in the population?

A: No. But racial minorities
are entitled to the opportunity,
equal to that of the majority, to
elect candidates of their choice to
office. Experience has shown
that where such opportunities
are in fact equal, minority candi-
dates have been successful at the
polls.

Dear Fred:

Fred

Have you ever thought about an exciting career as a plasma donor?

icipate in Varsity Sports

than punching his calculator and cri-
ticizing things he doesn't fully
understand. There is more to the col-
legiate experience than just
academics.

By participating in athletics, a stu-
dent can gain a more rounded edu-
cation as well as a greater
perspective of the real world.
Obviously, Mr. Andrews cannot
comment on the good aspects of
competing on a varsity team: ties
made with your teammates and
competitiors, learning how to win
and lose graciously, and developing
discipline and dedication involved in
both daily training and competition,
just to name a few positive aspects.

Through the course of any day
during the week, one can find stu-
dents drinking excessively. Non-
athletes are especially included in
this group, so why not mention
them? To single out two incidents
that also just happened to involve
athletes is extremely biased.

What about the near-riot at a Pitt
fraternity this past fall orthe some-
times extensive damage caused by-
intoxicated individuals over the
course of any weekend? How about
the harassment females endure by
some students at a bar or the number
of incidents of rape or assault that
have occured in Oakland within
recent months? Sometimes these
incidents get publicized, but more
often than not, we hear nothing
about them. Those incidents
involved non-athletes, so why single
out other certain individuals when
everyone has the potential to
become involved?

Our point is this: While there area
few bad apples in every batch, as in
all walks of life, let us not forget
about the good ones. Not all

student-athletes (but a few,) are the
drunk, rude, stupid, drugged-out
animals that the media makes us out
to be.

Very few students will contribute
three or four hours of leisure time
daily to an activity that only another
athlete would deem worthwhile.
Less than 5 percent of the athletes
coming out of college get profes-
sional careers. Due to the fine work
of organizations like the Senate
Athletic Committee and Support
For Student-Athletes, an organiza-
tion run by the Senate Athletic
Committee, not the athletic depart-
ment, Pitt student-athletes have’ one
of the highest rates of graduation of
any NCAA Division I school in the
country.

What about the academic All-
Americas this school has’produced
in the past three years? Speaking for
ourselves, we are proud to represent
the. University of Pittsburgh by com-
peting in varsity sports and main-
taining above average grades in a
demanding curriculum.

By your reasoning, Mr. Andrews,
if any student with arms could go
out for the crewing team, (such a
team was looked into a number of
years ago but was turned down
because of the amount of commer-
cial traffic on the rivers), then why
ean’t this same principle be applied
to any sport? What is your excuse,
Mr. Andrews, since you, we assume,
have a pair of arms? To us, it sounds
as if you have a bad case of sour
grapes!

Japanese, on the other hand, have

produce a wide variety of both on-

sizes that the people can afford to

Now Ronald Reagan steps in to

The Flying Karamazov Brothers

“riié i¥i£é“Néw:;"1tiiliawiBrii"éi ‘i'9’§3

I

By CHRISTOPHER
APPLE-GS/ATE

Crooked accountants juggle
books. Big men on campus jug-
gle dates. But who would dare to

' juggle things like sharpened meat

cleavers, live cats, scythes, and
swords, providing a barrage of
outrageous one liners and puns
at the same time? The Flying
Karamazov Brothers, that’s
who——five enormously talented
and profoundly unpredictable
artists who are appearing at the
Stephen Foster Memorial Thea-
tre through April 17.
The Flying K’s are much easier
to watch than to write about.
Their act, which they call “Jug-
gling and Cheap Theatrics,”
defies description, and compari-
sons pale. Their improvisational
zaniness suggests the Marx
Brothers, and their blend of daz-
zling juggling and, quick wit
evokes. W.C. Fields (a brilliant
juggler as well as a comedian),
multiplied by a factor of five. But
not really. The Flying K’s are
that rarest of experiences in the
theatre—a totally unique perfor-
mance group.
The Brothers (Ivan, Smerdya—
kov, Fyodor, Alyosha, and Dmi-
tri) are actually brilliant

practitioners of a form of theater
that was dead before any of them
were born—Vaudeville. If this
were 1930, they would be playing
the Orpheum Time circuit and
soon to be discovered by some
lucky agent and shipped to Hol-
lywood. In 1983, the Flying K's
are on their way to Broadway,
where they will open at the Ritz
Theatre on May 12.

As if their other talents were
not enough, the Brothers are also
superbly musical. Juggling and
music, we are told, share a com-
mon rhythmic basis, and the Fly-
ing I(’s demonstrate this fact in
startling ways. The five perform
'a complex jazz percussion piece,
for example, generating. the
rhythms by juggling fifteen
bowling pins. As if this were not
difficult enough, they insist upon
performing the piece in 5/4 time.
Howard Patterson (“Ivan") and
Paul Magid (“Dmitri”) perform
a xylophone duet, each juggling
three sticks without missing a
note of the melody.

If their musical and comic tal-
ents were taken away, we would
still be in awe of the Brother’s
juggling abilities. Their skills
defy belief; the space above the
stage is glutted with flying
objects, moving among the per-
formers ‘in patterns of bewilder-

Comic Brothers Live To Juggle”,

ing complexity. When you
consider that these objects are
frequently uite dangerous
(flaming torc es or sharpened
scythes) and that the Brothers
casually trade comic quips with
one another while doing it, you
can only conclude that their
powers of concentration border
on the superhuman.
Randy Nelson is “Alyosha,”
Samuel Ross Williams is “Smer-
yakov” and Timothy Daniel

. urst is “Fyodor.” The groups 0)

performing cats 'are Wow and

‘ Flutter (ouch).

The Flying K’s are aided and
abetted by a very talented group
of musicians performing on
instruments ranging from elec-
tric guitar to accordian and pic-
colo. The” music, by Douglas
Weiselman and Douglas Spae, is
a curious‘ blend of march music,
Jewish folk rhythms, jazz and
rock. Oddly enough, it works
wonderfully, but please don’t ask
me how.

Curtain times at Stephen Fos-
ter are 8:00 p.m. Thursday and
Fridayand 7:00 p.m. Saturday
and Sunday. There is also a 10:00

p.m. show on Saturday, and 2:00

“If I had had the chance to title the
book, I would have called it ‘The
New Romance,’ “ he said. “I’m writ-
ing a second book which deals with
keeping romance alive. I found
throughout my research that women
are more unsatisfied than they ever
have been before. '

The second half of the lecture was
a question-and-answer period which
became somewhat heated. A young
woman expressed her dissatisfaction
saying that she felt Morgenstern was
sexist in calling one of his friends a
“lady lawyer.” Reading a passage
from his book, which was read out
of context, she said that he was belit-
tling women.

There were many comments from
men saying that they agreed with
Morgenstern and questions from
students asking how a man is sup~
posed to know whether or not to
open a door for a woman or do
something romantic and not fear
being rejected. Morgenstern said to
keep trying: if ‘a girl says no the first
time, keep calling 'if you’re
determined. -

“There is a breakdown of com-
munications between men and
women today. If both sexes would
speak up and say what they want,
sexually and emotionally, we would
all be a- lot happier. Men must be
prepared-to take the lead and make
the first move. They must be decisive
and emotional to provide romance
in a woman’s life,” Morgenstern
said.

QQAQLQQQ
T

By MARK_KENNY

Recent allegations against the
Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) regarding the misuse of funds
allocated for use in the clean up of

— toxic chemical waste sites across the

country have brought the issue’ of
environmental contamination into
the public eye and under the scrutiny
of the Reagan‘ ‘Administration.
Though most of the controversy is
taking place in Washington, the
work of a Pitt graduate student has
brought the issue closer to home.

Scott Fazden, a student in the
environmental chemical hazard
assessment program at the Graduate
School of Public Health, recently
finished investigating a case of
chemical contamination of the water
supply in Valencia, Pa., a small com-
munity just north of Pittsburgh. The
results of his study demonstrate that
even minor incidences of chemical
contamination have an effect in the
overall picture of environmental
pollution.

Fazden began his study by check-
ing the results of test run by the
Department of Environmental
Resources (DER) more than two

and a half years ago, which found-

benzene, a carcinogen present in
gasoline, in some of the wells located
in the community.

Fazden chose the casein Valencia S

as the subject of his graduate thesis
after he discovered that the DER
had done nothing to correct the

_ situation once the problem had been

defined.
His goals were to find out how
many families were affected by the

contamination, to determine the

geographic boundariesiof the con-
tamination throughout the
borough, and to locate the source of
the pollution. ’

He began by sampling the wells
that had been tested previously by
the DER to make sure that the wells
were still contaminated. After find-
ing that they were, he measured
them for the actual benzene content
and found that of the 103 wells in the

'community a/pprozimately 20 per-

cent of them contained measureable
amount of the chemical.

Fazden, said the I8 contaminated
wells were all relatively isolated geo-
graphically from the rest of the com-
munity, so there was little chance

that the contaminant would spread-
The next step of his research was .

to determine the quantities of the
pollutant involved. He said the
results of this test produced a disper-
sion pattern which showed higher
concentrations in some areas than in
others. From these results, he set up

a concentration gradient, which

indicated that one particular area of
the borough had the highest concen-
trations of the pollutant. It was in
ths area, he said, that an abandoned
gasoline storage tank was ‘dis-

covered that still contained material. '

For the purposes of _his_ study,
Fazden said his research is now com-
plete, but he will be going to Phila-
delphia on April 20th to present his
findings to the water quality director
of the EPA’s mid-Atlantic region to
suggest that the borough be supplied
with an alternate public water
supply. He said he believes that
because the problem was due to a
leak into the environment, the case
should be considered for emergency-
action funding from the EPA’s con-
troversial Superfund. .

The current problems within the

administration, he said, will increase
the chances that the leak in Valencia
will be cleaned up. ‘ _

“I think that the EPA in the past
has been a little reluctant to act when
there aren’t vast numbers of people
involved,” he said. “But since they’ve
been getting such bad press and
they’ve had such a hard time, I think
right now they’re very eager to do
things which have a very positive
public connotation.”

Fazdenlsaid he wants to follow up

on the human health effects of the =

benzene on the citizens of Valencia.
The levels of exposure to humans
were 70-80 times higher than recom-

_mended levels of exposure, he said,

but the recommended level was only
an extrapolation from laboratory
animal and industrial testing. At the
levels found in Valencia, however,
there is no way to really tell what
kind of effect the exposure will have.

Fazden said that rural «water sup-
plies should be checked much more
closely than they are now because of
the potential pollution problem they
face from agricultural pesticides and
contamination from the septic ‘sys-
tems common in rural areas.

‘‘All of that goes someplace,” he
said. “I think that’s going to be a
major concern in the future.”

Concerning the widespread effect

of toxiccontaminants in the envir-

onment, he said there is anational
problem, but it‘s especially a prob-
lem in Western Pennsylvania.

“When you consider the number
of in-ground storage tanks that have
been just abandoned, you get some
idea of just how pervasive this prob-
Iem can be,” he said.

Fazden also said there are chemi-
cal storage sites in this area which

are on the EPA’s1list of sites to be®

cleaned up. Onerof the top fivesites
in the nation is in Butler County in
the Bruin Lagoon.

“Even though the Bruin Lagoon
presents a greater danger in that it
would effect more people if some-
thing happened,” Fazden said, “I see

' the problem in Valencia as needing a

more immediate resolution because
it’s already there, it’s already having
some sort of impact on their health.”

Situations such as the one in
Valencia should be remedied by the
DER and the EPA together, he said,
but the questions remaining are
whether cleanup of this area will be
done and whether it will be done
expeditiously.

“I think those are the real ques-
tions that I hope to get answers to
when I go to the EPA headquarters
on the 20th,” Fazden said.

  T Hypnotist Demonstrates Powers

“By ANN WALKER

“Journey to a world of fantasy,
where great experiences happen and
total relaxation is the key."
Although these words sound like an

, invitation to Disneyworld, they are

the words of John Kolisch, a hypno-
tist and mentalist.

Kolisch, who performed before a
large audience at David Lawrence

Tuesday night, was speaking of the
altered state of consciousness called
hypnosis. The show was an array of
Kolisch’s ESP talents and his art as a
hypnotist.

During the first half of the show,
he performed such feats as stating
the amount of change in a man’s
pocket and telling the time arbitrar-

RE: LSAT, GMAT, GRE Test Preparation

Each year more and more students are preparing for
and taking the LSAT, GMAT, and GRE. Because of this
increase, the competition to attend the better Law,
Business, and Graduate schools has become awesome. A
failure on your part to adequately prepare for the LSAT,
GMAT, or GRE will put you at a competitive disadvantage.

One of the best ways to prepare for these important
exams is to take the professional classroom instruction

tape and a blindfold. The most
intriguing of the blindfolded-
perception demonstrations was
when Kolisch described a woman
and her outﬁt—right down to a
string of pearls-simply by holding
her gold bracelet.

The second half of the perfor.$l:i"L“"

mance proved to be the funniest.
Twenty volunteers ran to the stage
for their chance to be hypnotized.
He said ‘he is the world’s fastest hyn-
otist, and within five seconds, the
subjects were indeed in a trance-like
state.

This is where his promised “jour-
ney to the world of _fantasy” began.
The audience was entertained by
comedians Richard Pryor and Steve
Martin and by vocalist Roberta
Flack, all present by way of students
under hypnotism. Finally, Kolisch
first made his subjects think the
audience was naked by hypnotic
suggestion, and then he made them

think they themselves were na,ked,‘Q§i.

and they ran for cover.

- Kolisch said he does not only use
his powers for performances; in
everyday life, he finds his persuasive
powers helpful. '

“When I want a seat on the bus, I
merely suggest to the person with my
mind that they should like to offer
their seat to me. And they get up and
ask if I’d like to sit down,” Kolisch
said.

He also conducts seminars in
which he hypnotizes people and con-
vinces them to quit smoking or helps
them to lose weight. Kolisch has
written “How to Better Yourself
Through Hypnosis” and “Lesson in
Dynamic Auto-Conditioning” and
hs appeared on such television pro-
grams as The Tonight Show.

“Positiveness is essential for hyp-
nosis, you must want to be hypno-
tized,” Kolisch said. “You are aware
of everthing around you—it is a
state of total relaxation—but the
subject makes his own decisions and
wouldn't do anything he wouldn’t
normally do."

Born in Vienna, Austria‘, Kolisch,
said he is an extremely happy man
and that through hypnosis, his life
has been filled withjoy. He has been

LIFS JUST A BOWL OF sNAo<£

By MARY ANN KRUPA

Monty Python's Flying Circus is I

airborne once again, and this time
they've zoomed in to train their guns
on some more sacred cows in The
Meaning of Life.

Python's brand of humor has never
been good clean fun, and their follow-
ers are by now accustomed to the
extremes they will reach in lampoon-
ing the human condition.

In The Meaning of Life, they pull out
the stops relentlessly, for they have
given themselves a large arena to
muck about in, and the results are
relentlessly hilarious. _

The movie is not, however, for the

faint of heart or the weak of stomach, F

and anyone expecting a good, cheap
laugh should prepare himself for the

I price he will pay to get it since Python

does not restrict themselves to mere
gratuitous gore and scatology-——they
take it to an unthinkable degree.
They get away with it every time,
too, because they use it efficiently to
expose the conceits, hypocrisies and
absurdities of our time.

The movie takes us from birth to
death in seven stages, which is the

m)’°

- TRANSPORTATION (ROUND TRIP)

“ts I0‘:

only adherence to any sort of form
that the film bothers to allow, since
Python insists upon cramming as’

.much into each sequence as our

senses can absorb without
overloading.
Birth is an institutionalized night-
mare for mother and baby as they are
slammed and shunted about in a sea

of technology-mad doctors and

administrators more enamored of a‘

machine that goes ”ping” than con-
cerned about the welfare of the
patients.

Catholics take a full frontal assault
in a song-and-dance number cribbed
straight from Oliver!, where an over-
populated industrial town hits the
streets with a lush musical tribute to
the sacredness of sperm in the
Catholic ideology.

As in every Python film, the princi-
pal characters are all taken over by
the six Pythons themselves, and
Chapman, Cleese, Palin, Jones, Idle
and Gilliam still manage to do old
ladies better than old ladies and every
conceivable class stereotype better
than members of the class
themselves;

They have some wicked fun with

organ donors in a scene that is both
appalling and, ultimately, surreal, as
it closes with another musical
number about the insignificance of
life on earth. ‘

The most talked-about, and proba-
blypthe most unforgettable, scene in
cinema history, is oneythat features a
mammoth fat man, played by director
Terry Jones, in a chi-chi French res-
taurant, alternately gorging himself
and disgorging into a slop pail pro-
vided by the obsequious waiter,
played with prissy perfection by John
Cleese. It is a ghastly business, and it
would drive audiences to the exits in
search of their own place of relief,
except for the fact that is so shock-
ingly, unbelievably funny.

Heaven for the middle class is a
plastic, glitzy hotel presided over by a
Barry Manilow-style showman after
an inconvenient visit from the Grim
Reaper at a dinner party.

Python persists in alerting our
senses while shredding our sensibili-
ties in a style that has no equal in
cornedytoday. Mel Brooks may satir-
ize anal ablutions and use lots of dirty
words, but Python can take the same
tools and slam home a point in a way

PSYCHEDELIC PURSITHE FIVE
March 31. 1983

David Lawrence Auditorium
By I-‘RANK DIGIACOMO

"A wolf in sheep's clothing" could
be used to describe last week's Psy-
chedelic Furs concert, but_unfortu-
nately, this time the wolf couldn't get
past the wool. The Furs took the
stage ready and able to win their
audience but were unmercifully
stopped short by a shoddy sound sys-
tem that left the group bleating with
helplessness.

It's a ‘shame, too, because anyone
standing close enough to the band to
hear and see them would have sensed
that their extensive touring has
groomed the Furs into one exciting
live band.

The Five opened the night's event
witha very well-received but short
set. This band is another example of
what extensive practice and perfor-
mance can do for a group's appear-
ance. The Five has come a long way
since "Napalm Beach," and their set
showed that they've done much more
than just survive. Their sound was
much better than the Furs’, but it was
still muffled by the rotten acoustics
of David Lawrence. This tended to
over—enhance Dave Doremus' bass
and drown out Reid Paley’s vocals,
but it was still a far cry from what
happened to the main ‘act. The
group's best were ”Ha Ha” and ”Last
Rite," not to mention Paley’s shiver
dance, which consists of his turning
his back to the crowd and shaking his
Ileft leg——all he needs is a fire hydrant
to complete the effect.

Showcase, Friday April 8, 1983

Sound Puts Furs
On Bargain Rock

When the P—Furs took the stage
almost an hour later, one thing was
apparent right away—this is a band
that loves its hairdressers. Every
member, except for bassist Chris
Butler, has some type of bizarrely
coiffed hairdo. Singer Richard Butler
looked like a cross between Shirley
MacLaine and Bowie with his wavy
locks and all—leather tuxedo ‘while the
rest of the band sported a gypsy look
that seemed to (more) satirize the
group's musical attitudes-fashion

has never been one of the Furs’ cal- »

ling cards.

Drummer Phil Calvert counted
time and the band lurched into ”Into
You Like A Train.” Immediately, it
was evident that the band was having
problems. Between verses, Butler
was constantly looking back at the
monitors as if he couldn't hear him-
self (if he could, the audience
couldn't), and saxophonist Gary
Windo was also having problems
with his miking. The rest of the band
sensed this but kept the beat steady.
The horrible sound was relentless,
and by the time the band did ”Love
My Way,” Butler seemed too bored
and disgusted to try any more. His
vocals became flat and monotonous
and at times seemed to drop outcom-
pletely.

Despite this aural kiss of death, the
rest of the band did not follow
Butler's course of surrender. In fact,
they showed a lot more polish than
what was evident at- their November
stint at Heaven last year. The biggest
improvement is drummer Calvert,
who seems to have added a lot of his
previous Birthday Party flourishes to

the Furs’ backbeat. Last concert
found Calvert bored with the Furs’
simple drum patterns; this concert
showed him gleaming and deter-
mined. Moreover, the guitar combo
of Ashton and Chris Butler is getting
better than ever—especially Ashton,
who has progressed a helluva lot.

A change came during ”Mrs.
Jones.” Suddenly, the tang came back
to Butler's voice and the band burned,
making this the best song of the set.
There was no improvement in the
sound, but Butler's icy heart was back
into it. His cold stare and gritty vocals
on ”Sister Europe" capped off the lat-
ter part of the set, making it much

Book To The Egg

Ioe Egg: A Thoughtful Commentary
On Contemporary Life

By LINDA HENRY

One bare twig stands in a pot
among prolific greenery on the win-
dow stand in the corner of Bri and
Sheila's living room. Life is.every—
where: two cats (with ﬂeas), a guinea
pig, goldfish, the plants and 10-year-
old Joe. Bri feels like -one of Sheila's
menagerie or ”all alone like Joe
Egg"—a saying passed down from his
mother. He isn't getting enough
attention, a common- complaint by

‘men whose mothers never told them

no, as we discover is the case with Bri.
]oe Egg, being performed through
April 10 in the Studio Theatre in the
basement of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, makes numerous statements
about contemporary life.

Written by British playwright
Peter Nichols, the full title of the play

 72.6%’
Blue  ii A‘

is A Day in the Death of ]oe Egg. The
action takes place one evening when
Bri (Brian) is left home to watch
daughter Joe while Sheila goes off to
rehearsals with the amateur theater
group she has joined. While his wife is
gone, Bri gives their daughter a full
bottle of anti-convulsive medication,
which leaves her in an almost coma-
tose state. Later, he takes her out into
the snowy evening wi only her
nightgown on in hopes that the shock
will kill her. Ten-year-old Joe is "spas-
tic," a vegetable confined to a wheel
chair whose only movement comes
when she is having a fit. And so,
among other things, we are con-
fronted with the issue of_euthanasia.

The characters in this play have a
sensitivity toward their predicament
that could only come from someone
who has had to deal with raising a
retarded child, which is the case with
Peter Nichols. These people may
question God, cling to each other, and

defend their child, but they joke and
make fun of their situation as well.
Directed by Jane Rothman, this pro-
duction has found a way to make all
of these emotions real and valid,
Bri is played thoughtfully and with
jesting cynicism by Douglas Krizner.
When we see him, he is drained of
life, fed up with his job, feeling neg-
lected by his wife and tired of his
mother. His only hope seems to be to
get rid of Joe, so after his failed
attempt to kill her, he leaves.
Maura Minteer is lovely and pas-
sionate as the full of faith Sheila. Not
happy with her fate, but nonetheless
accepting, she finds a way to endure.
Even as Bri walks out (supposedly to
make a phone call), she is optimistic as
she comments to Joe, ”We have a
wonderful Daddy, don't we?"
Despite the excellent performan-

ces, the first act, one long confronta-

tion between Bri and Sheila, drags a
bit. The timing is too slow, but when
the other cast members enter in the
second act, the pace quickens, and our
emotions are held util the final fading
of the lights._

Bri’s friend, Freddie, is played with
just the right touch by Dan Wyse.

   PABST Is THE PLACE.

     
   
 
 

While Bri thinks he is interfering,‘
Sheila says he is trying to help; we see
him as doing both. Wyse is convinc-
ingly earnest despite his misplaced
zeal

Elena Bertolino tilts her nose at
just the right angle as Freddie's wife,
Pam, keeping herself one step below
snobbery. She is uncomfortable here
because her three children are all
beautiful, and by her own admission,
she can't handle anything NPA (Not

mother, played by Caryn I. Ronis,;
also captures our sympathy. And
there is Joe herself, a demanding role
played with amazing realism by 10-
year-old Sigal Mandelker.

The cast is well-balanced and sensi-
tive enough to pull us back_and forth
between the different ways of deal-
ing with Ioe and life; soon we realize
nothing and no one is totally right or
wrong. ' ‘ V

Technical work was adequate-—
nothing very risky or outlandish. The
difficult script was well-performed,
leaving us to ponder the question of
who is‘ the tragic hero here: the man
who can't cope and walks out or the‘
woman who is left holding the" bag?

Rock's Misonthro

LEGENDARY HEARTS
Lou Reed I
RCA

This album is a triumph for
Lou Reed. I-Ie’s often been a
man of many personal failures,
but he has always converted his
miscarriages into masterpieces
of poetry and music. Whether
meant to be warnings or simply
some sort of course descriptions
of life, Reed's songs have always
been damn good at describing
what it's like to screw up. Legend-
ary Hearts, however, is not a mis-
anthrope’s testimony——it is,
instead, a well-crafted state-
ment that Lou Reed has found
control.

While this album still has its
share of songs that deal with
weakness and shortcoming,
Reed is no longer in their midst.
Instead, he takes an omniscient
role; observing the human frail-
ties but no longer participating
in them. Some of the songs like
”Don't Talk To Me About
Work” and "Bottoming Out"
speak in first person, but are
removed from a lot of the pain
and boredom. Still, Reed is an

accurate voyeur, and he does

Musically, legendary Hearts is

no great change from Blue Mask. .

A lot of the songs are slower

Women"'s chord structure,
though it  not suggest that

there is a lot of repetition. While
”Martial Law" and "Bottoming

side of Reed, a lot of the claus-
trophobic atmosphere of Blue
Mask seems to have been

on Legendary Hearts.

Lyrically, this is some of
Reed's better work. Unlike the
vague and often galactic ram-
blings of Blue Mask, Legendary
Hearts brings Reed's poetry back
to street-level. His lyrics are
substantial and filled with imag-
ery. Some, like ’’Make Up Mind”
and ”Bottoming Out” even fare
well as pure poetry. ”Home Of
The Brave” is "People Who
Died” ala Reed while ”Don’t
Talk to Me About Work” des-
cribes the terrors of the nine—to—
five grind. It is ”Betrayed,”
though, that captures Lou Reed
at his best. This is a sad but see-
thing song that captures the
tragedy of incest and how it
effects a woman's relationship
with a man other than her
father. It's a tough subject to
handle, but Reed never did ally
himself with the easy things in
life.

Legendary Hearts is an excellent
album that puts Lou Reed in a
new perspective. With this
record, he proves that he can
touch the affects of others with-
out destroying himself in the
process.

INARTICULATE SPEECH or

THE HEART “
Van Morrison
Warner Bros.

What is this, Van Morrison

gone prolific? It used to be that

he'd put out an album about
once every solar eclipse, but
since 1979, there have been five
Morrison releases, including his
latest, Inarticulate Speech of the
Heart. What all five records have
in common is their failure to live
up to everyone's expectations of
"Van Morrison's next great
album," and while the injustice
of suchwa burden is obvious, the
‘reasons for its continuing are
not. '

His insistence on innovation

certainly plays a role; evidence
the use of the more traditional

musical forms of his native Ire-
land and a steady flow of jazz-
fusion riffs. The synthesis of
the two again dominates this
latest effort, providing musical
imagery dripping in mood and
legend against which Morrison
spins mystic and ambiguous
tales to the obvious delight of
his art but to the understanding
of few.

Morrison's real poetry isn't
lyrical; it's his use of a musical
caden_ce led by Pee Wee Ellis’
hypnotic flute and sax work,
especially on the instrumentals
"Connswater" and "Celtic
Swing." But even musicianship

M MM MM

. as elegant as this takes a back

seat to Morrison's timeless
vocals, those earthy, R&B-
tinged laments that make it all
but impossible for the man to
make a bad album.

The interpretive powers of - '

his voice are heard immediately
on the first cut, ’’Higher Than
The World,” as its placid jazz
beginnings give way to an up-
tempo bounce and Morrison's
gritty vocals. That progression
is repeated time and again,
whether on the half-spoken
”Rave One, John Dunne,” or the
pop-like ”The Street ‘Only
Knew Your Name.” The back-
ing vocals retain a distinctive

when Morrison ventures off
into more folk and country 8:

western avenues on "Irish
Heartbeat" and "Cry For
Home.”

Overall, the album leaves the
listener somewhat unsettled, its
pastoral shapings at once both
romantic and yet remorseful.
But that dichotomy may be just
what the title proclaimed, and
this is clearly music from the
heart, not from the wallet or
balance sheet. After the seem-
ingly endless stream of synthe-
pop and garage punk filling the
airwaves of late, the simple
beauty of Van Morrison's music
comes as a welcome relief.

DEEP SEA SKIVING
Bananarama
!.ondonlPolygram

If you're looking for music
with meaning, stop right here.
Bananarama, as you can surely
tell by their name, have about as
much in common with
Nietzsche as the royal family ‘
has with politics. Nil.

If you don't already know
about these ‘three young, Eng-
lish girls with hair that looks
like wind-blown palm trees and
voices that sound like those of
dippy debutantes, then you're
way behind the times. They've
already been featured on those

_covers of every major English
music ’zine, gathering hordes of
fanatic young followers who
imitate their make—up and dress
throughout Britain and beyond.
In America, they've had. only
one solidified dance-club hit in
”Really Sayin' Somethin'," but

‘just last week they made an
appearance on Dick Clark's
American Bandstand plugging
their new single, a remake of

"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him

Goodbye," so it shouldn't be

rncshowcase, Fmiay April*>8;'3P933

long before you start seeing
Bananarama clones in your
hometown, too.

Deep Sea Skiving (these women
seem to have a fascination with
the odd title) is, for lack of a
better description, a cute little
debut, slick but not greasy.
While it's apparent that Siob-
han, Sarah and Keren aren't
good singers or songwriters and
that the producers had to work
extra hard to make them sound
as good as they do, many of the
songs are somewhat overpro-
duced. Barry Blue, the main
producer, seems to be the main
culprit; "Doctor Love" (written
expressly for the band by Paul
Weller of The Jam), "What A
Shambles," "Hey Young Lon-
don," "Young At Heart" and
"Wish You Were Here," the
disc's newer songs (the rest
have appeared elsewhere, on
singles and EPs), all produced by
Blue,‘ suffer slightly from too
much OOMPH! The girls’ weak,
thin vocals are made so much
more the obvious by such glitzy
backdrops.

"Really Sayin' Somethin',"

V "Shy Boy," "Boy Trouble," (the
B-side of "Shy Boy,-" which was

originally titled "Don't Call Us")

on Deep Sea Skiving, which might

tations of a Pittsburgh band.

Technical problems held up the
start of Wall of Voodoo until 10:30,
way past thesbedtimes of those fortu-
nate waifs whose mommies let them
go to the concert. So far past their
bedtimes, in fact, that Wall of Voo-

Stanard Ridgway, the crowd

the distance between itself and the

audience but could do little to close

The audience finally woke up and

and Ridgway exclaimed, "Oh, so now

and the video junkies slammed and
pogoed through the homage to South
of the Border. The response exasper-
ated the band, which finds itself
unable to live with or without its
MTV success. Voodoo tried to over-
come this hurdle by taking special
care to thank its pre-video fans, but

"ATLAS
by Glen Baxter
Knopf

Glen Baxter's Atlas ought to be on a

‘ coffee table somewhere; it looks very

sedate and thoroughly respectable, at
least from the outside. Of course, it's
bad form to judge books according to
that. Look inside, past the cover,
because Atlas leads to some

surprises-—it's a collection of car-

toons, ‘vaguely geographic in con-
tent, and they are quiet classics.

Baxter is marvelous——his draw-
ings are highly detailed and well-
defined, a style somehow
old-fashioned, reminiscent of 19305
adventure comics, or something sim-
ilar. Some of the work is categorized;
he explores "Great Culinary Disas-
ters of Our Time" and some other
"Great Failures” (a square’HuIahoop,
for instance).

The captions match with deadly
accuracy and matter-of-factness.
" ‘We don't hold with Puccini at the
Lazy Z,’ snarled Tex” or "He spoke
fervently of his vision of a chain of
multi-level pancake houses in every
major city in the Netherlands...."

Baxter achieves perfect’absurd syn-

are most disarming.

Cartoonist B. Kliban does similar
things with cats and various charac-

GOD'S HELICOPTER

Slow Loris Press '

"It was 1955...it was fall, Ike was
President, the leaves were changing
colors and complexions, and Ralph
Kiner, left fielder for the Pittsburgh
Pirates, was the greatest man ever to
live." And God's Helicopter takes off.
There's a comfortable, tasty famil-
iarity to Lee Gutkind's compact
novel of growing up in Pittsburgh.

With great care, Gutkind paints
his major characters, three young
boys with nothing in common except
a misfit status in the neighborhood,
at school and perhaps even at home.
Willie Heinemann is 12, and he has
an ulcer—he narrates the proceed-

Willie has overheard from his par-
ents that young‘Middlebaum has
cancer and will not live long.
Willie's interest expands into a
friendship overshadowed by some

inevitable and unpleasant facts, but 

in the meantime, he and Rip and
Middlebaum discuss and explore
with sixth-grade daring—sex, alco-
hol, fantasy and murder—in short,
"all part of growing up."

Willie has imaginative concep-
tions of God, who visits him at odd
times. God is a random fellow in a
white robe and buck shoes who over-
sees the world, and Middlebaum's
future in particular, from the seat of
a large and loud velvet-interior heli-
copter. Willie hears the warning clop
and thud of the machine and asks
why his friend should die. "Don't you
see? There's nothing I can do about
this,” God explains-, and Willie can
only watch, apprehensive and
concerned.

God's Helicopter is concisely told
with honest humor and poignancy.
Author Lee Gutkind, an English pro-
fessor at Pitt, has two books of non-
fiction to his credit; this is his first
novel, a nicely memorable debut.

THE METROPOLITAN NEW
YORK IOB BANK .
Senior Editor, Robert Lang Adams
Bob Adams, Inc.

Once the job prospector has earned
his college degree, he naturally seeks
an alternative to the want ads. The
Metropolitan New York ]ob Bank provides
options for the hunter with New
York City as an employment objec-
tive. The Bank is a specific, detailed
guide designed to provide a head
start for the graduate seeking a pro-
fessional career. Virtually every
major business and institutional
entity in the area is listed. Arranged

alphabetically, each entry contains‘

the name of the organization,
address, telephone number and usu-
ally names of whom to contact, a
brief description of operations and
possibilities for jobs. Special sections
on hospital, university or govern-
ment employment information are
included, along with an industry
cross-listing.

In addition to the New York spe-
cifics, Iob Bank provides some realistic
(although rather simplistic) infor-
mation on job-winning techniques,
offering basic guidelines for drawing

up a resume, researching and pros- _

pecting, interview etiquette and
direct contact with business firms.
The information is general and
applicable anywhere, and it's upbeat.

Although it offers no promises,
The Metropolitan New York ]ob Bank pres-
ents employment options in the city
and surrounding areas——northern
New Jersey, Long Island, southwest-
ernl Connecticut and Westchester,
N.Y. Similar Banks are available for
Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles,
northern ‘and southern California,
Texas and Pennsylvania—-—each a
comprehensive guide which may
prove to be a valuable aid for the
graduating student.

WVU Smashes Panthers, 6-0  

By TIM DINGER

The Pitt tennis team was rained
out after they completed the singles
matches last night, but it may have
been for the better as they lost the
singles 6-0 to a powerful West Virgi-
nia team.

“Anytime you have a team come
in with 23 games under its belt, you
know they have some experience
over us,” tennis coach George Dief-
fenback said. “It’s not like a basket-
ball where the underdog goes out
and upsets a better team. In tennis, if
you have six guys that are better
than your six, it's virtually impossi-
ble to pull out six upsets.

“They were an awesome team,
they just came off a big win over
William and Mary and they just got
back from a southern trip with a 6-4
record," he said. “Any time a north-
ern team can do that well against
southern teams, you know they have
to be tough. They have some guys

that are deﬁnitely national caliber.”
The loss puts Pitt’s record at 3-4

. while WVU goes out at 15-7.

In the number one spot, WVU’s
Joey Cambers (12-I2) eased past
Pitt’s- James McDonald 6-2, 6-0.

At the number two position,
Panther D.J.‘Mariano did not fare
much better as he fell to Mountain-
eer Pete Perrotta (l5-7) 6-3,6-2.

At number three singles, Larry
Lederer (2-5) had the closest score of
the day, losing to WVU’s George
Veronis 6-4, 6-4. Lederer was win-
ning the second set 4-l before falling
to the powerful Mountaineer.

At number four singles Panther
Jack Warwick (2-5) lost to John
Nilsen 6-1, 6-2, while at number five
singles, Pitt's Dave Kortyna lost to
WVU’s John Moore 6-3, 6-3. Clos-
ing out therainy-day match, fresh-
man Jim Blackburn got his first
experience as a singles player only to
lose to John Prokity (14-3) 6-0, 6-0.

“We had some interesting perfor-
mances on our part,” Dieffenbach
said. “Lederer and Mariano were in

their matches all the way, and Jim
Blackburn filled in well. It’s verydif-

5 ficult for a freshman to come into his

first match against a team like this.”

Although the match was one’

sided, Dieffenbach plans to have it
work to his advantage.

‘‘It will help us tremendously. I’ve.
told my players to convert this into a
learning experience. I think we're
going to go into the rest of the season
with a much better attitude,” he said.
“I'm expecting a much improved
team the last ﬁve games of the sea-
son, starting today with St.
Vincent’s.-

“We're looking to sweep all the
matches this weekend. Gannon’s
going to be tough, and Duquesne
will be competitive. It's going to be a
case of who’s more aggressive. My
goal for the rest of the year is to have
a 6-4 record on the season.”

The Panthers start a tough wee-
kend schedule with a trip to St. Vin-
cent’s today and will host Gannon

Gymnast Exercises  

By CHARLIE O'HARA

For Panther gymnast Dave
Smith, respect has been hard to
come by.

For the third consecutive season,-

Smith, a native of Butler Pa., who
has-gone virtually unnoticed all sea-
son, has qualified for the NCAA
championship meet in the floor
exercise this weekend.

Having competed in the presti-
gious meet twice before, Smith
believes he has a definite advantage.

“I know what the judges‘are look-

ing for now,” he said. “Too often,
the competitors will try the toughest
tricks that they know and fail. The
judges are looking for strong clean
routines. -

“There is another determining
factor in how the judges often times
come up with scores. Almost no
matter what, the opening guys, the
guys who have to go first, get lower
scores. I‘ve been fortunate in the
past to get late draws. I hope that
this year is no exception.”

The competition is excellent; in

fact, the United States Olympic.

team will include several of the

entrants ‘in this weekend’s

competition. _

“Anyone who makes it to Nation-
als has toibe pretty good,” Smith
said. “The season averages of almost
everyone competing is somewhere
around a 9.5 or a 9.7. It’s all a matter
of who has the outstanding routine
on that given day.”

   
     

 

T-I

  Consistency Easily

There will be approximately 50
competitiors in the ﬂoor exercise, of
whom eight will qualify fori the
finals. Smith’s goal is to make it that
far.

“I think .I’ll need a good draw and
then a clean routine,” he said. “I just
missed making the finals last year. If
you can make it to the finals; then

you stand a good shot at All-‘

America honors, which are awarded
to the top six in each event.”
Though he regrets not having the
entire team competing, Smith is
pleased with the accomplishments

made by ‘the team throughout the '

season. - A

“I think we had a very good sea-
son," he said. “Thefreshmen did
quite well, despite the fact that we
lost Kevin Garren, whose absence
may very well have made the differ-
ence in. our being at Nationals as a
team. We finished the season ranked
l4th, which is an accomplishment.
We have already been given next
season’s goal, make it to Nationals
and beat Penn State. Coach
D’Amico believes that next year will
be the year. 4"

“I think we all know now what it A

is going to take to make it next
year.” .

Smith is confident about the ablil- ’

ities of D’Amico. ,

~ “He knows his techniques,” Smith
said. “He is very determined to have
a winner. He doesn’t settle for any-

For Her,

Charla Lineman envisions bodybuilding on protes

circuit someday.

Seezox Photo

By MARK A. SINDLER

Not many people at her age take
to changing a daily lifestyle as radi-
cally as she did about a year ago. But
her body was telling her something,
so she figured that it was time to take
some action.

Staying fit and trim was to
become a No. 1 priority with her.

Charla Lineman not only took to
a running schedule togtone her mus-
cles and give herself a healthy glow,
but she ended up competing in
women’s bodybuilding. It turned
out to be quite a reversal in lifestyles
for the 5-4 brunette, now 23.

“Right now, bodybuilding is
really important to me,” Lineman
said. “As you get older your body
starts falling apart, and that's what
happened to me. I then started dis-
tance running for weight control and
to stay trim. It turned into a compet-
itive sport for me.”

As an indication of Lineman’s
situation, she said her weight stood
at I28 lbs. during her sophomore
year at Pitt. Now down to 106, after
a “pre-Christmas” 120, Lineman fin-
ished first Tuesday evening in the
second annual Pittsburgh Collegiate
Bodybuilding Contest.

Her placing serves as a tribute to

the previous 10 months of strenuous

1*}té’l>ait ivats,"r’ria‘;y wstii ‘§:‘l <.ss"3“

LiftingBuiIds Body, Personality 

work, including four days a week of
lifting, three hours each day. Run-

ning four to five miles a week also

occupies her time.

Through all this training over a
relatively short time span, Lineman
not only saw a change in physical
features but in personality, too. The
discipline and work regiment totally
reshaped her.

“Bodybuilding gives me a lot of
confidence,” she said, “and has
made me realize what I can accom-
plish physically; it’s really changed
my outlook on myself. It’s a lot psy-
chologically because you have to be
disciplined and motivated to train
and to diet.

“It’s strengthened me not only
physically, but it has emotionally,
psychologically made me more con-
fident. I feel more in control of
myself now that I can diet strictly-—I
can handle it; I can handle being on
stage in front of 300 people.”

That isn’t how many people she
posed before on Feb. 19 for Miss
Allegheny Mountain, but it was still
a difficult situtation for Lineman.
She had no confidence then, she
said, and could not have competed if
it had not been for her sister, Janice,
who also competed.

“I couldn’t have done it myself,"
Lineman said, “because I was too

Summer Internships in

 

Homebuilding Management

WHY ]OlN AN mousmv
IN TRANSITION?

Because the future belongs to those who prepare for it. Ryan Homes,
one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, is actively preparing for the

future with investments in new products, programs, and most impor-
tantly, people. Our stable ﬁnancial resources, innovation and produc-

tivity have put us in the forefront of our industry today, and will keep

us there in the future.

This summer, we have outstanding opportunities for students who are
interested in learning homebuilding management from the inside out.
You'll be relocated, at Ryan's expense, to one of our major metropol-
itan markets on the East Coast. You will spend 10-12 weeks gaining
valuable exposure to all aspects of our business, including Planning,
Construction and Sales.

These internships, which offer competitive salaries, have a two-fold
purpose: they let us see potential managers at work, and they give
you a foothold on a promising future with our expanding organization.

We seek people with strong leadership qualities who are within one
year of receiving their degree. While Business degrees are preferred.
applications from Liberal Arts students with a demonstrated interest in
a management career will also be considered. Reliable transportation
is also required.

Right now is the time to join an industry in transition. Preparing
together, we'll both come out far ahead of the game. Send your
resume, and cover letter, today to: Personnel Dept. l’, RYAN HOMES,

afraid, not too confident. Even when
l was on stage, I couldn’t believe I
was there.” ,

Janice, a bodybuilder herself, not
only provided psychological sup-
port for Lineman but also got her
started in bodybuilding last June.
Two months later, after “starting to
see results and wanting to see what
would happen," Lineman got offthe
recreational kick and intensified the
bodybuilding part of her daily

schedule.
Part of that schedule requires that

she eatrmore than the balanced meal 

an everday person would encounter.
Not included on her daily menu-
composed of high protein, whole
wheat, vegetable and fruit entrees~
are those foods containing salt, fat
or sugar.

Now looking forward to someday
becoming part of the professional
circuit, Lineman is aware ofan iden-
tity image she must defend during
her aspiring drive to be the best.

“I'm really proud of this,” Line-
man said, hoping to attend colle-
giate national competitions in
Tennessee late this month. “A lot of
people look at it negatively because
they right away think of a woman

[bodybuilder] as a very large, mus-,

_cular, masculine woman. It’s really
not about that, nor is that the type of
woman that is big in nationwide
contests.”

Two Stepping Down....

Ray Grebey announced his resig-
nation as executive director of the
Major League Player Relations
Committee yesterday. He plans to
stay on indefinitely as a consultant.
Grebey, 55, is a career labor rela-

ions professional who took the
ﬁaaseballjob in 1978. He represented
major league owners during the 57-
day strike by players in 1981.
Also announcing his retirement
yesterday was Denver Bronco cor-
nerback Aaron Kyle. The seven—year
veteran is leaving pro football to
enter private business.
Kyle attended Wyoming and was
the No. 1 draft choice of the Dallas
Cowboys in 1976. He joined
Denver’s ranks as a free agent in
1980.

Head coach Dan Reeves, a former
Cowboys backﬁeld coach, said Kyle
was a “major contributor” to the
team.

Possibly Stepping Up....
San Diego Chargers quarterback

Dan Fouts will meetwith USFL
commissioner Chet Simmons on

Spring Breaks Open Miscellaneous Ideas

Sports Column

By MARK A. SINDLER

The term is ending, which means
it is time to clean out my cluttered

desk and release those thoughts

symbolic of a still sane person living
admist weather conditions that
make a mockery of Ft. Lauderdale
sunshine:

0 Skepticism has gripped me ever

“since Pitt football coach Foge Fazio
' said that he was giving strong safety

Tom Flynn a shot at quarterbacking
a team that hopes it won’t nosedive
after Dan Marino’s departure.
Formerly a high school quarter-
back, Flynn is a highly-touted candi-
date for All-America honors at
safety once the I983 campaign ends.
Now that he’s switched sides and
hopes to play commander-in-chief
for a sluggish offense, chances of

that happening are slim to
nonexistent.
More importantly, Fazio, by

experimenting with Flynn at quar-
terback, is attempting to solve a
long-term problem with a short-
term solution. Flynn is entering his

./1y-final season; he won't be around

after that. So who's going to be Pitt's
offensive general after that?
Obviously, Fazio’s going to have to
train another man for the position.

There’s little hope now for a
potential championship or major
bowl bid on the horizon.

‘My longshot candidate is sopho-
more Chris Jelic. He hasn't thrown a
pass in the blue and gold, but neither
has Flynn. Maybejunior John Cum-
mings has the ability to remove

Flynn from starting offense, but as
of now, anything would be better
than sticking with Flynn.

He's proven himself in the back-
field; the only reason he should stay
there is that when you look at
Fazio’s current quarterback
dilemma, you have to think ahead
further than one season down the
road.

0 Sports Illustrated arrived a cou-
ple days late in the mail last week.
but that didn’t,stop me from eyeing
the catcher's mitt that Expo great
Gary Carter was donning on the
front cover. It was none other than a
product of the Mizuno athletic
equipment supplier.

The company is out ofJapan and
is yet one more industry the Japa-
nese have infiltrated in this country.
Not only has it been steel and
autos—to name a couple——but now
the Great American Pastime is being
affected.

lronic, isn't it? Soon, ‘American’
will no longer be as symbolic as it
was during the days of Ruth and The
House he built in New York.

0 After North Carolina State
guard Dereck Whittenburg
launched the shot heard around the
world with four seconds remaining
in the NCAA basketball champion-
ship game, Houston is just about
now done reeling from the devastat-
ing loss that it experienced.

Had the Cougars won it all for
coach Guy Lewis, one who’s been in
the business for 27 years, his two
stars, Akeem “The Dream” Ola-
juwon and Clyde “The Glide”
Drexler would most likely have
opted for the pros by the time draft
rolls around.

thing but extra effort. He has tried
very hard to instill consistency in our
routines, thus we were able to main-
tain consistent scores.

“There were many meets that we
won because we didn’t try things
that we hadn't rehearsed in practice.
This is Coach D‘Amico‘s style, and it
was pretty successful for us this
season."

Aside from his gymnastic efforts.
Smith has some solid objectives con-
cerning his academic future as well
as the possibility of doing some
coaching.

school for business,” he said. “If it’s
possible, I would like to be a gradu-
ate assistant coach here at Pitt for
the gymnastics team."

Prior to choosing Pitt, Smith had
been one of the outstanding high
school performers in the state. He
won the state title in the floor exer-
cise as a senior and WPIAL titles in
both the floor exercise and the vault.

For Smith, success has come with
each of the upgraded levels of com-
petitions that he has undertaken.

This weekend isjust another step
up the competition ladder, and ifthe
past is any indicator, Smith should
perform well.

Now, however, it would only be to
the two’s advantage to stick around
for one more year. Drexler, ajunior,
is still considering the NBA but
would fare better if he remained for
his senior year and lapped up the
year’s experience. Akeem has
already stated that he is indeed
returning to Houston; Drexler
would do well to follow.

His play under pressure, the kind
evident in the championship contest
against the Wolfpack, indicated that
Drexler may not yet be ready to han-
dle professional basketball.

He hardly came close to scoring in
double figures, raked in four fouls
before the first half even ended and
didn't slam or jam all evening. He
left “The Glide” somewhere in his
hotel room before starting.

0 While on the subject of basket-
ball, one cannot avoid the growing
pains Center High School's Marlon
Ferguson is now experiencing. Late
last week the center-forward’s par-
ents said neither would endorse his
letter-of-intent to Duquesne because
both believed Marlon was pressured
into a commitment by Dukes coach
Jim Satalin.

The 6-8 Ferguson, according to
his parents, seemed to have given a
verbal commitment to all three
schools in hot pursuit of him-—Pitt,
Ohio, Duquesne. What his parents
say about the multiple commitments
is probably true, but who can blame
him? Ferguson is likely trying not to
let any school down after their
intense recruitment of him.

He’s still an 18-year-old senior
who doesn't know any better, but for
his parents to say that he wants to

play for coach Roy Chipman is
unfair. The kid wants to play for all
three schools right now.

0 The Steelers, I have to believe,
are in a bit of a quandary right now.
With the passing-on of wide receiver
Jim Smith to the USFL’s Bir-
mingham Stallions, there are about
two veteran wide receivers left for
Coach Noll to work with.

After Lynn Swann opted for. an
ABC broadcast booth and early
retirement last season, only John
Stallworth and Calvin Sweeney are
sure starters for the upcoming sea-
son. lt’ll take a strong rookie crop in
the wide receiver slot if Noll is going
to get the necessary backup he’ll
need in case of key injuries.

0 Awfully pessimistic at first, the
Pirates now look to me like legiti-
mate second-place finishers in the
Eastern Division. Their hitting
should be solid as newly-annointed
captain Bill Madlock will slug his
usual .300-plus despite recent
surgery on his knee.

First baseman Jason Thompson
should replicate last season, during
which he belted 30 homers, espe-
cially since hejust inked a fancy con-
tract during the off-season. Then
there’s transistor-battery prone
Dave Parker. The big guy is in shape
and raring to go as he‘ll probably
shoot for the Triple Crown.

Parker has good reason to. This is
the last season of his ﬁve-year, $1
million pact. If he does well, which
he expects nothing less, it’ll make
him that much more marketable
once October arrives.

PRIESIENTS

Only trouble is, manager Chuck
Tanner's pitching corps presently
looks like the remains of a crystal
vase that fell to the floor. Thirty-
eight-year-old Jim Bibby is making
a comeback after taking last year off
due to rotator cuff surgery. He'd be a
definite question mark even if his
age weren’t enough to worry about.

With the possible exception of
veteran Tommy John, not many
pitchers return to the fine pitching
form exhibited prior to this surgery.

As if his age isn’t enough to fret
over, Bibby is about ready to turn
his glove in. Then there’s John
Candelaria. The Candy Man tore a
bicep muscle a couple years ago and
has been questionable in cold
weather conditions ever since.

It is likely that Candelaria could
be affected by the early, chilly weeks
of April and May and subsequently
be sidetracked the rest of the way
through. Third man in is the good
ole boy from West Virginia, Don
Robinson, who has a history of
shoulder problems and can only
hope to duplicate last season’s 15-
win output.

Dodger castoff Rick Rhoden is
peaking 30, still the ‘same mediocre
hurler he was after joining the
Pirates. Manager Tanner’s bullpen
seems secure with Kent Tekulve and
Rod Scurry, but might need some
shoring up.

Here’s my longshot trade early on:
Send second-string catcher Steve
Nicosia to Minnesota for reliever
Ron Davis, no strings attached.
Nicosia is unhappy over Tony

Prognostications

Pitching Key To St. Louis, y
San Diego Finishing First 

By IRA KATZ

(Editor's note: This is the first of a
two-part series predicting the fin-
ishes in baseball's National and
American Leagues.)

Major league baseball swung into
action this week; all of the clubs have
now opened their seasons in what
promises to be an interesting year of
baseball.

Part of this interest will be gener-
ated by the group of outstanding
rookies who will surface on many
teams’ rosters this year. A number of
these rookies will play key roles in
the success or failure of their teams.

During spring training in Florida,
scouts reported that this may be the
best group of first-year players to
come along in a decade.

In the American League, there are

_no less that five new managers,
including Billy Martin, who returns

to guide the Yankees for the third
time.

_ In the National League, Bill Vir-
don takes over as manager of the
Montreal Expos; but other than
that, not too many changes have
occurred in the Senior Circuit this
past off—season. First, the prediction
in the National League:

St. Louis: I’d like the Redbirds to
return as the NL East leaders mostly
because they have the best overall
balance and a guy frorn.Lancaster,
Pa., named Bruce Sutter, probably
the best relief pitcher in the game
today.

Montreal: On paper, the Mont-
real Expos appear to be the class of
the NL East, but as the saying goes,
pennants are won on the field, not
on paper.

Last year, six Expo players hit
better than their lifetime batting
averages, and three pitchers pitched
belowtheir career earned run aver-
age, yet somehow the club didn’t win
the division. V

Now the Expos have a tough drill

1 sergeant in new manager Virdon,

who replaced front-office seeker Jim
Fanning.

Virdon won’t win any popularity
contests with his players. The Expos
have had disciplinary and drug-
related problems with several of
their players in the past, and Virdon
was hired to run a tight ship.

Another problem that seems to be
holding this club back in realizing its
full potential is its bullpen. Woodie

Fryman, at age 43, isn’t as dependa-
ble as he was in the past, and Jeff
Reardon hasdhad arm problems this

‘spring.

Pittsburgh: “You never have
enough pitching," said Pirates gen-
eral manager Pete Peterson. That
statement may sum up the Bucs’
1983 season.

Although the Pirates have
received some encourging news on
their pitching staff this spring with
young hurlers Lee Tunnel] and Jim
Winn, both pitchers are still short on
experience in the big leagues. Don
Robinson, the teams’s biggest
winner last year (15-13), has been
suffering from arm problems again
this spring. The Bucs will probably

lead the league in hitting, but they -

will go as far as their pitching takes
them.

Dave Parker, who has trimmed
his 6-4 muscular frame down to 240
lbs. this year, should have a very
productive season. An added incen-
tive for Parker is that his $1 million-
a-year contract expires at the end of
the season.

Philadelphia: In Florida, one
baseball scout, Eve Goldberg of the
Houston Astros, probably summed
it up best about this ballclub.

“This club is very hard to figure
out; they could finish anywhere
from first to sixth.”

Already the Phillies have been
dubbed “The Old Red Machine”
and “The Wheeze Kids.” Take your
choice. The Phillies could be the
greatest thing since Geritol or they
could fall flat on their wrinkles.

The Philadelphia infield features
42-year-old Pete Rose, 39-year-old
Joe Morgan and the man at the hot
corner, whom many believe is the
best all-around player in the game
today, Mike Schmidt.

Cy Young Award winner Steve
Carlton should reach the 300-win
mark this year, but aside from him,
the Phillies’ pitching staff is a ques-
tion mark.

Chicago: General manager Dallas
Green is laying the ground work for
a winning team; however, it’s going
to take him a couple more years to
completely put things together. In
the future, you’re going to hear
about the Cub talent, which includes
infielder Ryne Sandberg and pitcher
Lee Smith.

To baseball's most devoted fans, it
will be another long summer at Wri-
gley Field. But wait until next year—
the future should be bright for the
Chicago organization.

New York: It is ironic that Met
general manager Frank Cashen is in
the same position as Green of the
Cubs. He has some really good tal-
ent developing in the farm system;
unfortunately, though he inherited a
club that was destroyed by the pre-
vious management. Other things
with which Cashen is going to have
to struggle are the fans, and the
media, who won’t be as patient in
New York, as they are in Chicago.

In the National League West:

San Diego: When the Padres
acquired long-time Dodger ‘star
Steve Garvey this winter, they put
themselves ahead of the pack. Man-
ager Dick Williams should be able to
manipulate his fine young pitching
staff to his advantage.

Los Angeles: A close second, but
no cigar. Rookies Greg Brock, Mike
Marshall and Candy Maldonaldo
will certainly do any adequate job,
but where the Dodgers will get hurt
this year is the schedule—it favors
San Diego, which has more home
games than LA does in September. .-

Houston: Manager Bob Lillis is
back after replacing Bill Virdon at
the midway point last year. Things
didn't go well for Lillis, initially. He
first learned that his ace reliever, Joe
Sambito, will be out for the season
with a shoulder operation, and that
one of his starting pitchers, Mike
Scott, can’twork until June because
of back problems.

Nevertheless, Lillis is going to be
pleasantly surprised by rookie
second baseman Dan Doran and ex-
Pirate Omar Moreno.

Atlanta: Braves manager Joe"
Torre finds himself in a peculiar
situation. No one expected his
Braves to win the National League
West title last year, but they did.
Now his club is favored, but it
appears as though it doesn’t have the
pitching strength to repeat last year’s
performance.

The difference this year will be
that Phil Niekro, at age 44 can’t be
expected to repeat last year’s 17-4
performance. Names like Perez,
Bedrosian, McMurty have yet to
become established.

Despite one of baseball's most
colorful owners—-Ted Turner-—
Amer1ca's team should suffer a drop
in the_standings.

San Francisco: The Giants proba-
bly have the best pitching staff and
most pathetic offense in the
