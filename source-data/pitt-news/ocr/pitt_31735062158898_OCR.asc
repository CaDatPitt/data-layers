week was the BXgt_9¢1I.Sl()Il Of The

Tokyo. While it  naive to
argue that no u_r'iderstanding
existed heretofore among these
three powers, ‘the fact remains
that there was nopublic statement
of agreement upon common POU-
cies. _ . '

The implications of this an-
nouncement are manifold. _ There
is now a_possibilit__y. of_;,a jdeﬁnite
alignment of great l?0W€,I’_-S. 1113011
the two mdes of an issue, the issue

being Democracy versus Fascism.

European Jigsaw. 
In 1935, when Italian-aggression
in Ethiopia threatened to upset the
peace of the world, thinking per-
sons could breathe easily because
there were too many bones of con-
tention among too many P0W€‘—1"5
for any deﬁnite alignment to mate-
rialize. ’ . R’ A
Thus we had France “and Italy
at each others throats, with Eng-
land favoring France because of
her desire to keep the Mediterra-
nean safe as the life-line of her
Empire. But, at the §ame time.
England and Germany were striv-
ing to arrange a naval accord, and
Germany was sympathetic‘ with
Italy. Russia was still an unknown
quantity, -and ,Ja‘pan‘ was ._1yins- 10W
to let the world forget the Man-
churian invasion. 3 .

Russia Ready , ' . - g

A radically different. situation
now confronts the diplomats of the
world.‘ The completion ofthe ac-
cord among Rome, Berlin, and
Tokyo has produced an announce-
ment by the Soviet Union that her
military forces are ready- for war.
In the face of such. a situation,
England may be forced to commit
herself, and it is incon'ceivabl.e that
the rapidly lengthening Fascist
axis will reach London.

This leaves an alliance with
Russia as England's alternative,
and this is not so inconceivable as
it might have been a few years
back. if the favorable press which
Russia has been receiving in Eng-
land and the United States isvany
indication. France, faced with in-
ternal collapse, and probably of
little help in any future emergency,
may be counted in with the Eng-
lish-Rumian alignment.

And: where do we come in—-
Probably as we did during_ the
World W31‘; somewhere in the last
act to inject fresh blood and to
pay the bills after it's all over.

means for peace action and educa-
tion, explains John Fritzmeier,
C39, chairman. It is the ﬁrst of a
series of Peace Council sessions
scheduled in an effort to ‘provide a
positive program of action for the
group.

“But primarily this meeting
should be merely one step in_ a
peace program, backed by inter-
ested students,’ who realize the real
meaning of present peace crises,”
says Fritzmeier. .

DEVELOP GOOD WILL

Present aims of the Peace Coun-
cil program, according to Fritz-
meier, are “intelligent interest in

the development of international‘

understanding and good will; basic
fundamentals of peace education;
cooperation in local andnational
programs for peace; demonstration
of the strong desire for peace that
is felt among students and teach-
ers of the nation; and unification
of the peace movement on cam-
pus.”

At the next session of Pitt Peace
Council, the expansion of mem-
bership through representatives
from all campus organizations will
be discussed.

MCFES Debating
Team Releases
Year’s Results

At the conclusion of the ﬁrst 16
intercollegiate debates this year,
records show that so far Men’s
Debating Association has faced a
larger aggregate audience than
they did during the entire season
last year.

The University team met West-
ern Reserve at various high
schools throughout Pennsylvania
and Ohio before 8,815 persons,
compared to the 7,900 faced dur-
ing the entire season of 1936-37.

Present plans call for regular
meetings of the’ varsity team on
Thursdays at 2:30 o’clock and
Saturdays at 9 o’clock in 1617 Ca-
thedral. According to Charles;W.
Lomas, instructor in English and
debating coach, the meetings will
be held to start work on a new
question.

The proposition to be discussed
in the next series will be the na-
tional Pi Kappa Delta question:
“Resolved: ‘That the National La-
bor Relations Board be empower-
ed to enforce arbitration in all in-
dustrial disputes.”

Stage Make-Up

University students will now be
able to study make-up for the
stage, according to an announce-
ment by Carl Cass, assistant pro-
fessor of English and director of
Pitt Players.

Because 90 students asked to be
allowed to help in Pitt Players’
make-up work, Cass said he had
received permission from the
Foster Memorial authorities to
hold classes in make-up in the
Foster dressing rooms.

Minimum cost of make-up
equipment for the course will be
$3.00. If a student wishes to buy
his own set, one can be obtained
for $6.75. Cass has posted a list
of the students who have asked
for the new class.

The new make-up classes will
be extra-curricular and will car-
ry no credits. They will proba-
bly meet twice weekly for two-
hour periods. The entire course
will take ten weeks. '

olis orchestras.

In his program tonight, Balok-
ovic will play several arrange-
ments of Yugoslavian. folk songs.
The main number on the program
will be Vivaldi’ Sonata in D ma-
jor, arranged by Ottorino Respi-
ghi, an Italian composer who died .
last year. 6

STUDENT RATE

Vivaldi, who was one of the
founders of the Italian school of
violin playing, was a vital inﬂu-
ence in the lives of Johann Sebas- I
tian Bach and George Frederich
Handel, the two German compos-
ers. Both of these men used Vi-
valdi’s Sonatas as models for their
early sonata works. The D Major
sonata is in four movements.

Other numbers to be given to-
night by Balokovic include Ern-
est Chausson’s “Poeme,” a one-
movement sonata by Slavenski,
and shorter pieces by Granados,
Schumann, Debussy, Rimsky-
Korsakov, Novacek, and Manoj-
lovic.

Tickets for the concert may be
purchaser at Mellor’s. A special
student rate of 25 cents may be
secured if the registration card is
presented.

Mrs. Mitchell, adviser to Na-
tionalities rooms, recently re-
ceived a letter from Mr. Benda,
the famous Polish mask-maker
who visited the Cathedral a few
weeks ago. Mr. Benda comment-
ed on the plans for the Polish
room by saying, “The design for
the Polish classroom, in Polish
Gothic style and based on the
architecture of the J agellonian Li-
brary, is superb.”

Hold Assembly
In Foster Hall

Miss Amos Will Talk‘,
" ‘ -To Freshmen Women
On Unit System

Announcement of assignments
to units will be made at the fresh-
man Unit Assembly Friday dur-
ing drill hour at the Stephen Fost-
er Memorial; At the meeting,
the purposes of the unit -system
will be explained more fully and
advisers will be introduced to the
freshman women.

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, will open the assembly
with a speech that formally ends
the eight—week mentor period.
Following Miss Amos’ talk, the
meeting will be turned over to
Lea Goldstein, C39, chairman of
the Unit Advisory Council of
WSGA, who will introduce the

 unit advisers.

Since units are being limited to
25 or 30 members each to facili-
tate cooperation and to avoid
confusion, freshmen were asked
to choose two units on the cards
which they returned to their men;
tors Friday. Each woman will be
assigned to either one of the units
she designated.

Pamphlets explaining the pur-
poses of the units and their plans
for the year were distributed to
the mentor groups several weeks
ago. '

Advisers to the units this year
are: Acting, Mary Annette Camp-
bell, C39”; .French, Lorraine Simp-
son, C39; Current Literary Re-
views, Edith Stewart, C39; Cam-

Faculty Hears
Expert Friday

Contrasting modern methods of
printing with those of the Eliza-
bethan period, Dr. T. M. Parrott,
professor of English at Princeton
university, will address the facul-
ty at a formal dinner-lecture Fri-
day evening at the Faculty Club.

Editor of many Princeton pub-
lications as well as a popular con-
tributor of research articles to
magazines, Dr. Parrott is consid-
ered by many to be one of the
greatest living experts on the
Elizabethan period.

A feature of Friday’s lecture on
“Plays and Players, or the Trib-
ulations of a Modern Editor,” ac-
cording to J. S. Fisher, social
chairman of the Faculty Club, will
be a discussion of the work of re-
search men. These so-called “G-
Men” of literature come across
many humorous and unusual inci-
dents, which will be described in
detail by Dr. Parrott.

Cabinet
Selects Officers

Ray Nordstrom, ’38, was elect-
ed president of the newly-formed
Mines Cabinet at the ﬁrst meeting
of the group Monday afternoon.

Other officers elected were ‘Wil-
liam Philipp, ’38, vice—president;
Louis Reilly, ’39, secretary; and
Donald Saxton, ’39, treasurer.
Ralph Dempsey, ’38, was appoint-
ed social chairman.

The new social chairman has
announced that plans will be
started immediately for a smoker
this semester and a dance next
semester. Officers of the organi-
zation ‘are also considering revi-

sion of the group’s constitution.

étheir test after today, but only by

making their appointments not
later than 4:30 o’clock this at-
ternoon.

SERVICES URGE TEST

In a joint statement released
yesterday. the health services
urged those students who have
not yet taken the Wassermann
test to “safeguard the health of
the other students in the Univer-
sity, as well as themselves, by
ﬁnding out deﬁnitly whether they
have contracted the syphilis di-
sease.

“Syphilis is so prevalent,” the

statement continued, “that it may
be contracted innocently—so in-
nocently that a mere handshake
may transmit the disease to an
innocent person. The t-treatment
is comparatively simple in the
primary stage, and if you do have
the disease it is best that you
learn about it when it is in its
ﬁrst stage; otherwise, in years to
come, the suffering will be so
much worse.
TESTS SIMPLE

“The Wassermann tests being
offered free through the sponsor-
ship of The Pitt News, and with
the cooperation of the health ser-
vices, and the City of Pittsburgh
Department of Public Health, is
the only method of ﬁnding out
whether the disease has struck,”
the statement concluded.» ,

Each test takes only a few
minutes to complete. The stu-
dent merely submits to a blood
extraction; the blood is then tak-
en down to the City health lab-
oratories, where it is tested. Re-
ports are available for the stu-
dents a week or ten days after
the test is taken.

Hop Features
New Rhythms 

Famous is the class of ”40 for
its discovery of “new” bands.
Newest ﬁnd is Phil Levant, who
will bring his rhythms to the Im-
perial room of Webster Hall, next
Friday for the Soph Hop.

From a run of 43 weeks at
Chicago’s Bismarck hotel, and
several weeks in Cincinnati, in-

cluding nightly broadcasts over,

WLW, Levant will bring his or-

ganization to Pittsburgh for Uni-.

versity approval Friday night.

Only once, at Kennywood Park
this summer, has he ever appear-
ed in Pittsburgh.
’ Chairman Pat Cusick, CE, and
bizman Homer Mcclintock, C, re-
port that sale of tickets is at a
fast pace, and that the few left
of the 250 quota may be pur-
chased from any of the commit-
tee members or from themselves
for three dollars each.

Committee members are requir-
ed, according to McClintock, to
attend a short meeting at 12:30
o’clock, tomorrow in 801 Cathe-
dral.

B001; Store Rents
Student Lockers

Three hunder and ﬁfty lockers,
in the ground ﬂood locker room,
are still available to students, ac-
cording to William F. Lenz, man-
ager of the University book store.

In all, 500 lockers have been in-
stalled in the Cathedral for the
convenience of students. These
were moved from their old loca-
tions in State and Alumni halls.

Yearly rental of the lockers is
one dollar, and locks are for sale
at the wholesale price of 70 cents.
Rental and sale of locks is taken
care of at the book store.

To the faculty and administration people

To SFA, social fraternities and other groups

l>a.ric war that 3-lad ever ‘taken place.

it meant peace and a return to home for
those who .';urvivcd whether mutilated or mere-
ly weak and tired from the strenuousness of
keeping alive, alert, and causing death.

It meant a possible rehabilitation of the
co11nt.rics wliossje land had been devastated. It
meant that tlic natioiis were returning to in-
ternational :sa.nii.y, that tile destruction of civi-
lization was enniling.

But that was nineteen years ago.

Toinorrow Armistice Day will be celebrated
-in China and Spain. with '.he boom of shells,
the death of men, and ihc destruction of prop-
erty.

In Europe the tension of the pending strug-
gle between fascisin and democracy will be at
its highest. The “haves” will be looking :Eear-
fully at the “have-not” countries. And the
“have-nots” are prepared to go to war for
things they want. -

‘In America we look on with smugness, tak-
ing part in the “armistice” with only a gallant
display of our decimated veterans.

Armistice Day, 1937, will see the World-wide
expression of preparedness for war, and this
country, pcac'e-loving in words, will take part
in the program beside- those nations she damns
for their aggressiveness. -

Editor, The Pitt News:

Armistice Day on the American campus signal-
izes a renewed effort on behalf of peace this year.
Students are realizing more "and more the signiﬁ-
cance of the major ward in the Far"East’ ,and'tl1‘é
revolution in Spain-—and of the ommous eventsin
Europe, where "nations are apparently preparing
for a second world war.

In the face of these world emergencies, most stu-
dents ‘sense that before long nations‘ will be jump-
ing at each other’s throats, and that possiblyythe
United Statespmight unwillingly but inevitably be
Therefore, students of
perception are forming peace groups, which crys-
tallize studenti sentiment for peace and form‘ a
representative nucleus for peace*educat;ion on the
campus. ’_l  '

In varying degrees students support, or think
about supporting, such a program. It is important
that students at the University of Pittsburgh realize
that such a peace group, a non—partia1, intelligent,
representative group working for peace, can con-
tribute much to the campus.

As chairman of the University of Pittsburgh
Peace Council, I would like to clarify its program
and explain its purpose and aims to the campus.
Its aims are these: Intelligent interest in the de-
velopment of international understanding and good
will; basic fundamentals of peace education; coop-
eration in local and national programs for peace;
demonstration of the strong desire for peace that
is felt among students and teachers of the nation;
and uniﬁcation of the peace movement on the
campus. ‘ “

In order that all groups on the campus can par-
ticipate in this program of creative education and
serious action, the Peace Council is broadening out
this semester. The program——centered, around a
monthly study group-—-consists of panel discussions,
forums, and peace waves. The ﬁnal end is to en-
able students to hear speakers and discuss among
themselves pertinent peace problems.

Representatives of all campus groups which wish
to participate in the program will actas a guiding
committee for the council. In addition administra-
tion and faculty heads will serve in an advisory
capacity. There is a deﬁnite need for such corre-
lation of groups and individuals on the Pitt cam-
pus; much can be accomplished by this‘representa-
tive Peace Council, if students View its purposes
in their true light. ‘ V ‘ ~ '

All out of breath, Saul Dizen—

a three-day tour of debating in;

“The more ‘I debate one side,

Reports Of Sturdy Nebraska

Team Worry Panther Coach

‘Strongest Foes
Yet To Be Met,’
Says. Sutherland

‘If it ’s the Notre Dame game
you're still feeliiig pretty swell
about, quiet your whoops for a
few minutes. andvthink of Ne-
braska. ‘I-‘he Cornhuskers .will

'1

be, in town this week-__end with

‘only one thoughtin mind and
according to’ record and re-
ports they have plenty on the
fdotball to accomplish it.

Even in Monday’s vigorous
celebration there was one discon-
solate note. It was the reminder
that Biff Jones .is bringing one of
the strongest Nebraska teams in
history into the Stadium on Sat-
urday to husk the Panthers.

Awakening in his P.A.A. apart-
ment, Dr. Jock Sutherland was
not at all startled by the horns
tooting out in front of the Cathed-
ral. He thought it was the Tar-

tans.
. SOMEWHAT PREMATURE

“I couldn’t really understand it
when I looked out and found that
Pitt was doing the celebrating.
We certainly. won a ﬁne victory
Saturday, butithe strongest team
we will have played this season
is coming up Saturday. I am con-
vinced that the celebration was
quite premature,“ said the good
doctor.

“And for further substantiation,
I refer you: to "Josh Williams.”
The Pitt_ backﬁeld coach has han-
‘died the Nebraska scouting as-
signment this year and has seen
the Cornhuskers in action for
quite a few Saturdays. f

NEBRASKA BIG

The ' Williams report was
enough to change the entire Mon-_
day outlook.’ In more than em-
phatic terms the former Panther
halfback corroborated the rumor
that the boys from out “where the
west begins” have a very able
outfit.

It seems that out in that part
of the country they grow ’em big
and that all the big. boysin the
state play football. At least, Pitt
teams have found in the past that
the huskiest boys they play dur-
ing the course of aseason are
‘those found on the Nebraska out-
ﬁt. .
This bigness has always been a
chief contributary factor in mak-
ing Nebraska a stubborn defensive
group. This year, the Cornhusk-
ers have a new coach, in the per-
son of Biff Jones, who is to ‘be
remembered in these parts by his
stay at West Point at which time
the Army produced some of its
finest football teams.

JONES HELPS,

Jones has brought a lot to Ne-
braska "football a1ready..
Cornhuskers now. have a really
dangerous ,off_e_n,se.. And the_ Ne‘
braska boys have been doing_.,a
whole lot to’ show their apprecia-
tion to Jones. He had a record
which never; showed a defeat in
the opening game of the season.

Nebraska ‘opened this season
with Minnesota, and the boys
kept that Jones record intact. In
order to do it, they accomplished
one of the season’s major upsets
and also classed themselves as
one of the country’s leading
teams. C

X-Country Dual

Season Ends

Having completed a dual meet
schedule of ﬁve meets, the Panth-
er hill and dalers will travel to
New York Saturday in order to
compete in the _Michigan State-
dominated IC4A cross-country
championships to be run oﬁ‘ in the
Big City’s Van Cortlandt park.

For the past four years the
meet has been all Michigan State.
In every meet since 1933 the
Spartans have taken ﬁrst place
and the team honors. Last year
_the Michigan boys took the IC4A
trophy home for keeps.

It will be a new trophy they’ll
be battling for this year but it
will be the same old tourney.
Michigan again is the favorite
with Penn State, Manhattan, and
Syracuse conceded a good chance
of coming through in the payoff
positions.

Coach Olson does not expect the
Pitts to be in the running for the
trophy, although he would not be
surprised if George Zamborsky,
captain of the Panther team,
should ﬁnish“ up among the scor-
ing runners. _

The Panthers . do not have an
impressive record in IC4A compe-

 

tition- Way back in 1923-24.,they.

held the _ __ championship, but V the.

best that they have done in recent .

years was a fourth place in 1935.

every man for himself, and the
best men get places _on the ‘first

. The two-team system will prob-
ably be in vogue again this year,
which means v_ that“ only ten men
will be taken on trips to play away
from home. Thus a spot on the
first or second team means that a

THREE PRACTICE VVEEKS

The team will practice for the
next three weeks, winding up the
sessions with a game on Sunday,
November 28, at Ligonier. They
will play an athletic club team
there.

With four returning seniors, the
team will have plenty in the way
of experienced hands. Garcia,
Zeleznik, Radvansky, and Captain
Johnson are on the floor showing
their stuff. - ~

Joe Fabel, a junior last year, will
not be back because he has left
school.

With a flock of good juniors and
ten good sophomore men coming
up, the team will not be without
material. So there will be plenty

will be much dribbling, while the
places on the ﬁrst two teams are
contested.

  "Sehricker caus 
. Ring Candidate

With one ~week of boxing
practice completed, J ack,Sch-ricker
reports that he has a large- turn-
out of freshmen, but a_ poor re-
sponse from the upperclassmen.

Forty freshmen candidates re-
ported for practice on November
1, but only a few upperclassmen
answered the call to gloves. This
was a disappointment to the
coach who said, “No varsity berth
is cinched.”

Thus far, there has been no act-
ual boxing by which any position
determination can be made. The
squad has been limbering up with
calisthenics. Regular ring ses-
sions begin the latter part of this
week.

POSITIONS OPEN

It is not too late, however, to
tryout. for the team. If you are
between 65 and 75 pounds, you are
particularly urged to come out for
there is a shortage in this class.
Those . interested report to the
Stadium at 3:30 o'clock any day
this »week except , Thursday.

Managers. for the varsity and
freshman squadsyare needed. Can-

.didates report to the Stadium at

the same time. .

The University has provided
the boxing team with one of the
ﬁnest training quarters in the
country. The. boxing room is
equipped with a rowing machine,
wall pulleys, wrist machines, a
mirror forshadow boxing, an 18-
foot square boxing ring, a calls-
-thenic mat, «two striking bags,
three dummy bags, and a private
equipment room and showers.
These improvements will aid in
rounding out a much better squad

‘ than ever. before.

Schedule Among

Problems

Hagan, director . of athletics, called
in the ho‘ekey_-squad for the ﬁrst
ofﬁcialf meeti'ng.; Twenty-eight
candidates responded to the re.-

Dr. Carlson for physical examina-
tion. '

Hagan V left” no doubt’ in the
minds ofthose present that there
would be ’a Pitt " hockey team.
Hagan, after completely, throwing
the backing. of the athletic ofiice
behind icehockeya at Pitt last ‘Fri-
day, announced that plans were
being formulated to secure a -pro-
fessional coach- for the hockey
squad. " ‘ '

Nothing further along 1 the
coaching line -was given out but he
did indicate that possibly a mentor
would be selectedein time »forvprac-
tice sessions scheduled. in Du-
quesne Garden beginning next
week. , I

LETTERS POSSIBLE

According to Hagan,’ the Uni-

with holding games between peri-
ods of regularly: scheduled profes-

would. rather
University games only. Of course;
since hockey is in its-embyronic
stage, _if no , other arrangements
can betmade, the former willhave
to be.

Hagan . hinted that. letters rather
than numerals will be given to
those‘ earning ;awards this year.
Jimmy preferred not tomake a
deﬁnite statement either way.

Developments along -this line
are entirely left to the athletic
council. I-Iockey will have to be
carried out "along the same lines
as other sportsiin the athletic pro-
gram in “order to earn letters.
There being no major and minor
sports in’-the University, hockey
letters, if they are given, will be
the same letters given for football,
basketball, track, tennis and the
rest of the departments.

TWO DISTRICT OPPONENTS ‘

' The policy carried out in other
sports of playing only officially
recognized teams of other schools
will be applied to hockey. Teams
available for Pitt opponents in this
district include only Tech and
Duquesne.

The league Pitt is expected ‘to
participate in will be made up of
these two local schools and other

is to be a meeting sometime this
week in Cleveland to organize a

Professors
Telepathy
-Drs. Root, Dietze

A Await Further I 

O Investigation

By FRED GREGG

Believe - it - or - not programs
have overworked the mental tele-
pathy gag for many years without
any 'conﬁrmation from reputable
psychologists. ‘ .. ‘ ‘

Psychologists have experiment-
ed with thought transferance and
clairvoyance for many years but
not until a recent radio series has
general interest been awakened.

Lately, Dr. J. B. Rhine, psych-
ology professor at, ‘Duke univer-
sity, announced the r_esults of his
newest. successful, experiment,
and the opinion that some people
do have “minute flashes” of clari-
voyance.

Local professors hesitate either
to reject or accept Dr. Rhine's
theory. Dr. William T. Root,
dean of the Graduate School and
head of the University phychology
department, is frankly doubtful.
Dr. Root spent four years at Stan-
ford during extensive experiments
on this propects. All results were
negat.ive. 4

(Dr. A. J. Diet:/.e, assistant pro-
fessor of '&.sycl)‘()l0gy, commented,
“Professor Rhine's theory is in-
consistent with allthe principles
of-psychology and ._ mathematics.
However, I amimerely going ;-to
wait until the results of the many
other experiments started, come
in.” . . 4 

In the Rhine tests, subjects
were selected at random. Five
cards of various symbols were
placed face down on a table. In-
dividuals were asked to name the
order of the symbols.

When scores were tallied, some
had perfect answers, with the ma-
jority averaging three or four
called correctly. The results,
claimed Dr. Rhine, are too good
to be explained by chance.

Among foremost psychologists
also carrying on telepathy experi-
ments are Professors Estabrook
and Gardiner-Murphy at t h e
Harvard laboratories.

Dr. Thompson
Writes Article , 

An illustrated story on “Mono-

frax” by Dr. A. P. Thompson of‘

the abrasive fellowship of Mellon
Institute, is the lead article in the
November issue of The Glass In-
dustry.  v- - - *
 “Monofrax" is the generic name
for a series ofnew electric fur-
nace super-refractories developed
at Mellon Institute in coopera-
tibn with the research laboratories
of the Carborundum company.
They are made by ‘melting various
refractory oxides or. mixtures of
oxides in the electric furnace, and
casting them __much. injlie same
mannecas 'a metal is cast.

In addition to outlining and de-
scribing brieﬂy the method of
manufacture, Dr. Thompson’s ar-
ticle summarizes the historical
background and the succession of
events and ideas which resulted in

the development of these novel-

refractories.
