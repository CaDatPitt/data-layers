(Editor’s Note—Pitt. News copy
editor Rosemary Ray and news
editor Ed Bachman gained a pri-
vate interview last Tuesday after-
noon , from .General Matthew B.
Ridgway, the ﬁrst ‘such press con-

. ference he has permitted since
P coming to the city.)

By ROSEMARY RAY .

The Mellontname has again
helped to bring a distinguish-
ed personality to the City of
Pittsburgh. This time the dig-
_nitary is General Matthew-B.

Ridgway who has just assum-

ed the post of Chairman of the
Board of Trustees, at Mellon In-
stitute. / A

“I want everyone to understand
that '=I am not a scientist,”ithe
General said. “My job here is '60
be an executive.”

I 1 . “ General Ridgway, vxiho has been
in Pittsburgh since Aug. 18, was

very impressed with the city.
. '_ People Warm
-“The people have been wonder-

‘T ful to me,” he said. “They’ve been
. very warm and interested and have

made me feel right at home.”
The former commander-of the

=Eighth Army in Korea was also
'. impressed with Pitt. The General

has turned down a number of
speaking invitations ‘but has ac-
cepted to speak at Pitt tomorrow
for UN'*Week. »«
“Pvelaccepted this invitation,”
he said, “because the,University'
..and Mellon are, and ‘should be,
very close.” -"
In answer to a question con-
cerning Pitt’s ROTC Dept., the
General said that he doesn’t know

_ "enough about Pitt.particularly but

he does feel that the. ROTC pro-
gram in colleges all over the coun-
try is adequate.

“ROTC is importantgin our
defense picture since it is ,the
major source of our officer ma-
terial,” he said.

When asked about a recent
statement’ Secretary of Defense
Charles E. Wilson made ¢oncern-

' ing the cutting of Army manpow-
er, General Ridgway asserted,,“L-

'don’t believe our Army should be
cut. Another war would come so
quickly that our reserve forces
would not be ready for it. We need
a standing army ready for im-
mediate action.”

Warns About Nuclear Research
A On the subject of nuclear re-
search, Ridgway~feels that the de-
tense program will suffer if too
much reliance is placed on nuclear
weapons.

“The destruction they cause is
so great that nations may agree
not to use them,” he said.

Concerning the United Nations,
the General was asked how well
he thought the U.N. was carrying
out its role as leader for world
peace. He replied that he thought
it was a step in the right direction.
' “After all,” he added. “it’s bet-

ter to sit down and talk than
stand up and _shoot.’) A

“The survival of American life is in Asia, for there is
fwhere the United States is most misunderstood and mis-

Facts Cited
The UN delegate brieﬂy outlined
hererthe U. S. stands with re-
ard to Asia. “Let us not indulge
in wishful thinking, these are the
‘ a9tS’i=
V There are 650 million Chinese
who follow “that godless ideol-
 known as Communism.”-
;These were the people whose
' load was dropped in Korea
for the Russians’ ‘war by proxy’.j’
Then, there are the neutrals,

 “Neutralism,” said Romulo, “is

Asia, “there are 650

million who 'aren’t with the West.”
M_But, according to the diplomat,
these ﬁgures do not complete the
picture. For there are 119 mil-
‘, on people unaccounted for who
ﬁe allied with the U. S.- These
girifclude ,the Philippine Islands,
‘Thailand, and Pakistan.
At this point, Romulo went back
 11 history to before World War II.
o_b'ody, ‘at that time,” he said,
,could beat the West in the use of
__rms." ,
But‘Japan proved to the world

‘better so that we may have cornplete mutual understanding.”

that this was wrong. “The West’s
invincibility was gone after that.
Much hate which‘ is found today

in the Far East springs from that.” .

Hated Us

' The General recalled that as a
youth he was “trained to hate the
United States. But, because you
(the U. S.) underscored the spir-
itual values of America,» followed
the Golden Rule, and respected,
above all, the dignity of the human
soul, you are, today, our greatest
ally.”

“You fought in Korea because
you couldn’t allow the U. S. to
fall to Communism,” he said.
“You are ﬁghting a struggle for
man’s minds.” ’

This, said the educator, should
be done “by spiritual values, not
by manpower.“ _

The Philippine delegate then
cited the fact that the U. S. did
just such a thing in the Philip-
pines, and, now it must do it in
the rest of Asia. ,

Follow Golden Rule

He said that the ‘Philippines

learned that “Your (the United

States’) word is your bond. The

American policy ‘was the Philip-

pine for the Philippine, the Ameri-
can conscience asserted itself.

ye:  general   Address

., ' General Matthew B. Ridgway, past. commander of
SHAPE and past army chief of staﬁ will inaugurate United
Nations~Week tomorrow in the Commons Room at 10:30 a.m.

. It is signiﬁcant that up until now he has refused ap-
proximately sixty speaking engagements throughout the
. Y country since having accepted a post as chairman of the
r ' board of trustees of Mellon Institute. He agreed to speak
 ' '4 ' ;.here because of the close relations which he.hopes will be
1 ' continuedbetween _Mellon Institute and the University.

 As one of the foremost world authorities on the interna-
. -tional scene, today, the general should be able to pinpoint
some of the major issues which faces the UN in its tenth
‘ year of existence. Being so "fortunate as._to have him speak
here, the, student /body should take full advantage of his
‘speech. The deans. have dismissed classes for the talk./

' .1 . . P What he says should be of vital concern to every col-
lege student who is thinking and establishing views for

, deal to be said.

In the past ten years, Walkouts in. the United Nations

_t "have usually been conducted by’ members of the Soviet

Union. We attributed these sporadic tantrums to stubborn-

1 ' 'ness. and an unwillingness to accept the reasoning of the

West, But within thelast ‘month, France called back its

| cortege from the Assembly -in a dispute over’. Algerian in-
 dependence. ""‘ ' ' ',

.-

By lrv Rothman

/
Despite that it is only Oct. 17, most of the
student governing bodies are well under way to-
ward a season of spirited activity. This is unusual.
It was only last year that Student Congress ofﬁ-
cials told this reporter programming_g:ioesn’t-“spark”
until December. \ i
This rather candid declaration came as a sur-
prise. The Pitt News had always

managed to print election results

in late March or early April.
We ﬁnally came to the con-

clusion that the time lapse was

due to faulty scheduling by fau1t- ; 1
less politicos who had cleverly 
maneuvered into offices so that _
interviewing employers wouldn’t ’

be too disturbed by empty activi-
ties records near their names.
A General Notion

It’s generally known in" educational circles,

unrealistic academic achievement.
But this year, government leaders have shown

" a thorough interest in student ‘affairs. Student
Congress has taken an important step. to assert
Pitt inﬂuence upon our city fathers. They’ve sent
a letter of protest to traffic authoiiities condemning
the tagging and towing away of student autos
Friday afternoon prior, to the Eucharistic Rally.
If «it receives a reply either to the eﬁect of
revocation of ﬁnes or least towardrconsideration of
future student. needs,.the leading solon group will
have done more of merit than was done all last
year. This doesn’t include the discount fund which
was effected only in the ﬁnal weeks of thesemester
and hardly received the ‘impetus it deserved. - -

ESA :Wha”rf's That?      1

By Ray Hostler
I Past.,Pres'ident, ESA

The scene is set in one of the.

halls at Pitt as two students are
talking during a break between
classes. One student asks the
other, “Say, how wouldyou like
to buy a» ticket to_ the Square
Dance that the Evening Students
Association is holding next Sat-
urday night?”

Most likely the other replies,
“Evening Students’ Association?
What’s That?”

Some of you have probably

been students in that scene. For .

those of you who have been ask-

ed that question by ticket sales-

man or may have wondered it -to
yourself, we would like to try to
, answer that question.

The answer
really, for the Pitt Evening Stu-
dents’ Association is YOU. Every
student who registers for late
afternoon, evening, or Saturday
classes, even if it is for only one
class, is automatically.’ an ESA

Promotes Socials ,
The Association was organized
to try to promote sociability and
more school spirit among ‘the
evening students. It strives to
make the Evening School more

.than just a school where stu-

dents come in, sitthrough classes,
and get‘ up to go home. again.
Through social activities, such as
Get Acquainted Parties, Square
Dances and the Annual Semi-
Formal Dance, the Association
tries ‘ to encourage fraternity
‘among the widely diversiﬁed stu-
dent body. The Association has
made it possible for the Evening
Student to buy season football
tickets at reduced rates and thus,
in another way, tries to bring the
Students together in an atmos-
phere other tha nthe classroom.

ning Students Association are

Cross-country Streak

. Snapped By Villanoava

By DON KAISERMAN
Twenty—one was the unlucky number for the Panther
harriers as they dropped a 27-30 thriller at Villanova Satur-
day after racking up twenty consecutive dual-meet victories

over a three year span.

Although the Panthers displayed a marked superiority

in depth, they could not place a9

_man in the top three. The host’s§

Alex Breckenridge copped first-
place honors in the very good time
of 27:45.

The pace was not as fast as
had been expected for this meet-
ing of two cross-country power-
houses due to the poor condition
of the course and the inclement
weather.

The meet wasrun in a steady
downpour and the thinclads were
so drenched that they discarded
jerseys during the course

 

The track, which served as both
the starting and ﬁnishing point,
was completely flooded and‘ the
main portion of the hilly 5.2 mile
trail was comprised of rain-slicked
streets.

Following Breckenridge to the
ﬁnish-line in 28.12 was the Blue
and White’s lone sophomore, Jim
Delaney. Both Breckenridge and
Delaney hold the ‘mile cham-
pionships of their homelands,
Scotland and Ireland, respec-
tively. ‘

Harry Kopil, who boasts the_
world interscholastic mile record,
nailed down the third spot in 28:35.

From the very start, Brecken-
ridge, Delaney, and Kopil forged

away from the field. There-was a
lapse over a minute and a half be-
tween third-place ﬁnisher Kopil
and the first Panther to cross the
ﬁnal stripe, Jim Moore, who was
timed in at 30.09.

Localpride Arnie Sowell ﬁn-
ished a. poor ﬁfth, more than
three minutes behind the winner.
Undoubtedly, Sowell’s sub-par

In First Seance

‘With crys of’ “Let’s play the
‘Huskers’ every week” those ex-
hausted (from -the ascent of Sta-
dium mountain) Pitt News Yogis
threw themselves in a heap into
a corner of the locker-room to
study the results of last week-
end's prognostications.

-By unanimous vote it was de-
cided to present guest yogi Bob
Grier with the title of “Worst
Swami of the Century.” Fullback

-Grier dotted his helmet last
week and put on his turban to
lend his superb selections. The
result: two right out of eight se-
lections.

Disturbing news reached the
seers concerning the “Game. of‘
the Weak“ between Hogback and
Possum I-Iollow. It seems that
when game time rolled around
1:30 a.m.) only seven players
from I-Iogback (the others were
evidently stuck in the mud) and
four from Possom Hollow had
showed up. (The others appar-
ently got holed up somewhere). ’

So, since they had lost their
football anyway, they decided
to play Capture the Flag. Unfor-
timately, the result of this game
will not be recognized by the
Rose Bowl Committee. '

Soccerites Surprised

By Duke and Wolfpack

By ALAN BERMAN

Two teams that were not expected to give them much-’
trouble handed Coach Leo Bemis’ booters successive defeats,
this past weekend. Duke copped a 1-0 decision and at North
Carolina State the Wolfpack caught the Panthers on the re-. --
bound, 2-1. .

The game at Duke will perhaps?
be the roughest the locals will play 
all season. From the opening mo—;
ments to the final whistle, play was t
marred by illegal blocks, clips,
and ﬂying elbows which escaped
the eyes of otﬁcials. It wasn’t until
Panther right fullback Harry Suz-
ick had his nose broken that the
officials got things under control.

Three scoreless periods went
by the boards with both sides
threatening often but neither
scoring.’ Early in the fourth the
Blue.Devils scored what was to
be the winning goal. ’

The situation at North Carolina
was'about the same. Rough play
was again the keynote of the affair
with the Wildcats taking advan-
tage of the physical condition of
the Bemisman to score once in the
firstquarter and again in the sec-
ond. -

Bob Cherry cut that margin in
half early in the third quarter.
Paul Griffiths, Karl Sheil, Norm
Zanardelli, and Bressanelli appear-
ed ready to tie the score at various
times only to.ﬁnd themselves _il-
legally interfered with until ﬁn-
ally two State boys were thrown
out of the game. But the Panthers
were unable to capitalize andthe
second setback of the season went
into thebooks. ~ 1

ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE: NO. I

“The proper study of mankind is man," said Geoffrey Chaucer
in_ his immortal Casey at the Bat, and I couldn’t agree more.
In these tangled times it is, particularly proper to study man-
how he "lives; how he functions, how he works. Accordingly, this
column, normally devoted to slapdash waggery, will from time
to time turn a serious eye on the social sciences.

-\In making these occasional departures, I have the hearty ap-
proval of the makers of Philip Morris Cigarettes, whose interest
is not only in promoting the pleasure of young Americans ‘by
providing them with a gentle cigarette, matchlessly‘blended of .
vintage tobaccos, grown with loving"-' ‘re and harvested with
tender mercy, then cured with compassionate patience and rolled
‘into ﬁrm, tasty cylinders and brought to you in king size or
regular, wrapped in fetching packages of lively crimson and
pristine white, at prices that wreak no havoc on the most
stringent of budgets; but who are equally concerned with
broadening the minds and extending the intellectual vistas of
every college man and every college woman. .

I, for one, am not unmoved by this great-heartedness in the
makers of Philip Morris, and though I ow it is considered

  

chic these days to disparage one’s employer, I shall not. Indeed, ‘ ’

I shall cry “Huzzah!” for the makers of Philip Morris. I shall
cry “Huzzah!” and “Bon appétz't!” and “Stout Fellows!”

But I digress. For our ﬁrst lesson in social science, let us turn
to the study of economics, often called the queen of the social
sciences. (Sociology is the king of the social sciences. Advertis-

ing is the jack.) Economics breaks down into\two broad general a

classiﬁcations: 1) coins; 2) folding mbney. But before taking
up these technical aspects, let us survey briefly the history of
economics. ‘ ‘ « i 4

Economics was discovered by the Englishman, Adam Smith.
He published his theories in 17 7‘8, but everybody giggled so hard
that Smith, blushing hotly, gave up the whole thing and went
into the cough drop business with his brother. '  "

For long years after that, economics lay neglected while the
world busied itself.with other things, like‘ the birth of Victor

‘ Hugo, thelast days of" Pompeii, and the Bunny Hug.

Then one day while ﬂyingra kite during a thunderstorm, the

’American Henry. _George~ (also. called Thorstein’ Veblen) dis- '

covered‘ the law of di-minishing returns, and then, boy, the fat
was in the ﬁre! Before you could say “knife,” the Industrial
Revolution was on! Mechanization and steam power. resulted in
prodigies of production. For example, a Welsh artisan named ‘
-Dylan Sigafoos before the Industrial Revolution used to make ,
horseshoes by hand at the rate of four a day. After the Indus-
trial Revolution, with the aid of a steam engine,.Siga.foos was
able to make entire horses. I ’

Men’s Council

   

Elects Schultz

Vice President

In close balloting, Ed Schultz,
Col. ’57, was elected Vice—Presi-
dent of Men’s Council last week.

Schultz defeated Sheldon ‘Mon-
sein, Col. ’56, and Ron Sobel, Col.
’57, for the position during the
MC meeting last Wednesday after-
noon in the Panther Room.

Schultz replaces Dave Guyol,
who has withdrawn from school.
Only one vote separated each of
the three aspirants for the import-
ant post.

-The three nominees temporarily
left the meeting while their merits
were discussed by their nomina-
tors. Chris Christ, Bis. Ad. ’57;
who nominated Monsein, remark-
ed that, “Everyone knows that I
don’t usually support members of
the opposition party, but if Coun-
cil business is to be run smoothly,
we have to vote for the best man.”
Christ is a member of last semes-
ter’s coalition of the Pitt and V.I.P.
Party, whereas Monsein was affili-
ated with the Panther Party.

John Lomond, Bus. Ad. ’56, said O

that Schultz, his nominee, “had
the desire as-well as the time to
ﬁll the vacant post”. '

Schultz is currently chairman of V

the important Student Relations
.committee. He ' is also Assistant

Manager of the football team and

‘the Vice-President of Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity.’

The answer to that is deﬁnitely “Yesl”, Charlie. We've
employed quite a number of college graduates. with
deﬁnitemilitary commitments, sometimes knowing that
they could Work only a few weeks before reporting for
active duty.
The reason is that Du Pont is primarily interested
in men on a “long range” basis. The fact that they’re
temporarily unavailable—for a good reason like mili-
tary service—isn’t any bar to being considered for
employment. After working only one day, an employee
is guaranteed full re-employment .rights—that’s the
law. But if a man works for Du Pont at least a full
year before joining the service, he gets a bonus of two
months’ salary. If he’s entitled to a vacation but doesn’t
have time to take it before leaving, Du Pont gives him I " ,
equivalent pay instead.
Even if present employment is impossible, Charlie,
we deﬁnitely recommend your talking with Du Pont’s
representatives-and those of other companies, too.
The very least you’ll gain will be valuable background
cts which may‘ be of realibeneﬁt to you
