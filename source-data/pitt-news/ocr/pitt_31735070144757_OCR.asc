Stereotypes have continued throughout

jfithe years: becauseleaders in the commu-
 continueto perpetuate them, a Stu-

dent Government Board member said at a
roundtable discussion Monday night.
“These leaders, maybe a pastor or an-

” other personin a h_igh position, sometimes
_think they’re speaking for a whole race or

culture,” said board member Alexa Jen-

nings. “They, and everyone else, have to»,

realize that- their ideas don’t ‘represent ev-

eryone that they’re leading: Each person.

has their own beliefs.”
Students came together to discuss_ gen-

eralizations about different cultures, races‘
and sexual orientations at the SGB diver-
sity committee’s second annual stereotype.

forum. _

Twenty-one students, representing
black, ‘caucasian,'Italian and Cuban back-
grounds, held .a roundtable discussion
about the origins and reasons behind ste-
reotypes in today’s world.

The group began the discussion by de-
ﬁning the word “stereotype.” The group
agreed that a stereotype is “putting a cer-
tain group in a certain box” to deﬁne it,
that it can be positive or negative and that
it is based on perceptions and ignorance.

Pitt sophomore Kayla Comrie said she
believed that most stereotypes are sim'ply
exaggerations of the truth or completely
false.

“I think people can see one thing or_

one person andithen let that one person

or culture,” said Comrie. “Onepperson can

tunate, but that’s_ijhov_i?i’,it is.” it A ‘A y P: .

Students also tackled common stereo-
types :}2iifid—'asked questions about 
that theyihavep heard over the .years. Diver-
sity committee _€§h'anning' Maids read
a list of diffetrent'.stereotypes“l.that_ targeted
black, caucasian, Asian‘, Jewish and Chris-
tian people, as well as immigrants; ‘

The group also touched on how stereo-
types ‘affected President Obama.

Jennings said because we are so fo-
cused on people’s races, important issues
are lost or looked over.

“People were so focused on Obama’s
race and middle name that.they lost sight

. _ on whether or not he was qualiﬁed to do

the job,” said Jennings. “The discussion

-, should have focused primarily on his role

as the president, not on his ethnicity. That
shouldn’t even matter.” .

In the end, stu'dents agreed that most
stereotypes are ampliﬁed generalizations
based on ignorance of different people
and cultures. ‘

Comrie said she thinks everyone should
educate themselves about different groups

p of people.

“I think it’s important to strive to defy
the negative stereotypes and. to educate
ourselves instead of settling  the com-
fort of ignorance,” said Comrie.

Martin agreed.

“It’s important for us to always defy
thestereotypes and to not stereotype our-

_ selves,” said Martin.

Pennsylvania court issued a restraining

order that froze all \X/estridge assets.

However, Pitt and CMU requested that
the judge temporarily suspend the trial be-
cause of similar" allegations raised in New
York City. '

Shortly after court‘ proceedings began
in Pittsburgh, the U.S. ‘Securities and Ex-
change Commission and the Commodity

tion against Westridge. , ,

The universities did not want Pittsburgh
action to interfere with‘ the efforts of fed-
eral ofﬁcials, said Nordenberg. ' V ‘ .

Because the case is still. pending, Pitt
could not release ﬁgures as to how much it
will lose, said Vice Chancellor Robert Hill.

There are no foreseen short-term im-
pacts o'n distribution from the endowment,
said Nordenberg, but potential losses must
be gauged before thelong-term effects can
be determined. 

Choy, page 5

‘he spent three years working on a farm har-
_ vesting bearis and sweet potatoes.

When the buffet in Atlantic City closed
in 2006; Choy moved to Connecticut, where
he worked for another restaurant owner he
knew.

He moved 'to Pittsburgh shortly after,

partially because he knew the former owner
' of the Sushi Boat.
Still, Choy will always refer to Malaysia as
“my country.” . .

- Choy was born in Kuala Lumpur in 1961.
He was the youngest of ﬁve children. He has
two older brothers and two older sisters.

Choy and his wife, who also works in the
restaurant rolling sushi, live in "Greenﬁeld.
They. rent one room in the house of the
three owners of Sushi Boat. .

Their three children live more than 9,000
miles away, on the outskirts of Choy’s home-
town. Though Choy has traveled back to
see them only twice in’ the last nine years, he
doesn’t complain about-how much he misses
them. He calls his children every week.

 Choy a proud father

Sitting in a booth at a neighboring restau-
rant, Taiwan Cafe, Choy straightens up and
‘ ﬁdgets as he talks about his children, who
are experiencing life in ways he could not.
Choy’s son, 26-year-old Chee Kuan, studied
computer science in England. Chofs elder
daughter, Chin Phei Ying, 25, worked her
way through medical school and now works
in a hospital. Choy’s 19-year-old daughter,

Hswu Huey, earned nearlystraight “A”s last .

Choy never ﬁnished school. He said that
he didn’t like studying and dropped out after
ﬁve years — Malaysian people typically at-
tend 12 to 13 years of schooling before they
graduate. . _ _ ‘ ‘

Though Choy didn’t have a knack for
academia, he respects young scholars.

“I didn’t take the tips from students. I
say,‘ ‘You’re students.‘ —You’re not working.
You don’t give me the tips.”f said Choy. “If
you’re working [professionally], and you give
me tips, no problem  A lot of students give

 Van poiicy bad

 students, advisers

, There aren’tia_lot of college
’ students 25 or older. They exist,
sure, but they’re certainly not nu-
} merous — at least, not numerous
enough to drive all the student
?'groups oncampus to their des-
tinations "for trips and activities.
 But if one of thosegroups wants
 to take more than seven people
 in a single van, the driver has to

_ ..._a. .._ _._ -- _. .... ,.. .. .

 be at least 25 to be in accordance '

 with a new University Fleet Ser-
 vices policy.

 The new rules dictate that stu-
 dents must be at least 21 to drive
seven-passenger minivans " and
25 to drive 12—passenger vans,

3 than 500 miles the students must
 have an adviser along for the ride.
And, as you may have ﬁgured out
on your own by now, this policy
sucks for student groups.

The 25—or-older rule is the pri-
mary concern of many groups,
3 but arguing that point is moot
because younger students can still
drive the smaller vans. Students

to buy more minivans and sell
off the old 12—passenger vehicles
,— which will probablyget next

 to no use any longer — rather
 than to try and change the policy
' back. i A -

' What’s of more concern is the
 rule that advisers must accompa-
ny students on longer trips. Not

sense, because truthfully it would
probably be beneﬁcial to have
 older, experienced adults along
on some of these long trips. This
policy is concerning because Pitt’s
advising system is not set up to
cope with regulations like this.

V Although all student groups
 have an adviser, a large propor-
 tion of them don’t serve in close

and- that on round trips ‘longer ‘

should really push the University ~

because the idea doesn’t make

or

communion with their groups.
Asking them to take their time
to go on long trips with student
groups is not only inconvenient
to the professors who agree to do
the job, it stretches their resourc-
es far thinner than is. fair.
Because Student Government
Board can’t reimburse advisers to
go on these trips with students,
they would have to pay out of 1

‘pocket for their expenses’. The

vast majority of student group

advisers are uncompensated, and

asking them to pay for their own
travel expenses" in order to chap-
erone student driving — notthe
trip, only the driving — is ludi-
crous. ‘
Dean of Students Kathy
Humphrey’s response to‘ these
problems is _ that she will ﬁnd
people who can drive for groups,
but ﬁnding people is just a'tem-
porary solution to the problem
—-— it alleviates the symptom, not

. the cause.

Pitt’s reasons for changing

.the policy were assuredly well-

intentioned, but this policy would
make it nearly impossible for stu-

AIG bonuses iaren't.igreat,lbu—t have to be left alone

 
    

by Mark Kozlowskii

Colum/ziat

Outrage! Outrageous! Boy, I’m
mad! The discussions in the news,
where they. ask the question: “AIG:
scumbags or the biggest scumbags
ever?” seem perfectly reasonable to
me. Why, those AIG executives are
worse than Bernie Madoff by 
their bonuses, worse than Benedict

Arnold,and almost worse thanjudas '
- Iscariot The public demands, and

must receive, their heads on a plate
By golly, cruciﬁxion is too good for
-them. .

The very public outrage over
the AIG bonus scandal has been re-
markable. You don’t usually see the
public this worked up unless abor-

tion is somehow involved or Brad_

Pitt is showing up to giveiautographs
Unfortunately, mobs are not -known
for exhibiting a great deal of rational
thought There are many  that
are being overlooked about these bo-

nuses, lost in a sea of condemnation _

and irritation. So, at the risk of being
thought in league with perﬁdious
Wall Street and the World Banking
Conspiracy — ofﬁces convenient
to those of the‘ Masonic and Papist

‘ conspiracies — some perspective, if

Imay. '
First, there _is the  and

‘overlooked fact that Congress can-

not do  whatsoever to force
those bonuses to be returned. At-
tempting to do so would be either in-

effectual or unconstitutional. This tax

that the House  through, to
tax bonuses at 90 percent,‘ could not

apply to the AIG bonuses "for one

simple reason: The law was passed
after the bonuses were given out
If the bill becomes law, and that

then Congress has-just done one of
two  It has either passed an ex
post facto law, a law that is retroac-
tive; or it has passed a bill of attain-

_ der, which is a legislative act that con-

ﬁscates property without the target
_of the attainder being convicted of a;
crime in a court of law

Both of these actions are explicit-
ly no—doubt—about—it, no-penumbras—

needed unconstitutional Article 1,
Section 9,is unequivocal on this point:
“No bill of attainder or ex post facto
Law shall be passed.” Congress can
stand on _its head, but the bonuses
will stand. '

Next, theiamountof money in
question is trivial. According to ABC

- online, the size of bonuses was a

mere $165 million. OK, OK, $165
million does sound like an awful lot
of money, particularly when viewed

from the perspective of a bunch of -'

college students who don’t'have any
money at all. - , -

However, overall, AIG received
$170 billion in federal money. In
short, that means a whopping" one-

_ _ thousandth of the federal money
law is applied to the AIG bonuses, i

went into these bonuses. That’s 0.1

percent, folks That would be like '

being outraged after you gave some-

. body $100 because he spentl0 cents

in a way you thought was irrespon-
sible_ iv '

We also have to wonder where
our heroes in Congress were when
all this bailing—out business started.
Well, surprise, surprise, there were
loopholes in bailout legislation that

allowed these bonuses. These loop-
holes were imer/ed in the legislation
at the request of Treasury Secretary

iTimlGeithner. The Hartford Cou-

rant from March 19 has Sen. Christo-
pher Dodd, D—Conn., admitting that
he was  around somewhere
when ‘this loophole was inserted at
the request/of the Treasury Depart-
ment

Now,-he claims he was unaware
of -the bonuses involved, which is
funny because according to his own
Web site, dodclsenategov, ‘he is
chairman of the Senate Committee
on  Housing and Urban Af-
fairs If Dodd, head honcho of the
committee, didn’t know that this very
important loophole had  in-
serted, then he is incredibly incompe-
tent However, Dodd aside, what this
means is that AIG was only actingin
a way that Congress had speciﬁcally
authorized. They broke no laws

Finally, Secretary Geithner, quot-
ed in the Courant, provides the ﬁ-
nal needed perspective, namely why

.Treasury requested that loophole.

AIG had already made promises of
bonuses to these executives Had

AIG not delivered on those prom-
ises, they would have been sued for

fraud by the very people receiving._

the bonuses The government would
have been legally liable as well, and
more -money probably would have
been lost in the legal wrangles and
the court—ordered paying of the bo-
nuses anyway.

In_ short, lost in the outrage. are
some very important facts that seem
to paint a very different picture from

the one the media is feeding us.AIG,-

contractually obliged to provide
these bonuses, took advantage of
legislation pushed through a Demo-

crat—controlled Congress to ﬁll those-

obligations, which were trivially small
compared to total bailout money re-
ceived. Because those bonuses have
alreadybeen paid, Congress risks act-
ing unconstitutionally if it attempts
to recoup them. AIG did nothing
illegal by  the bonuses, and

those who received bonuses are not
criminals How unfortunate that an-
ger is a substitute for

Some of the sayings are so em-

Celebrating the magi

by Tom VanBuren
Senior Staﬂ Writer

    

I’m not one to disparage mo-
dernity, but it’s changed the land-
scape of so many aspects of hu-
man interaction that it’s hard not
to be a little wistful.

— In a time when you no longer
need to even leave the house to
rent a movie, one beautiful little
slice of Americana suffers more
than any sense of nostalgia: the
local video store.

You know you-had one grow-
ing .up, before Blockbuster came
to your town and put it out of
business. It was a place with a
willfully quaint name like “Home—
town Video,” packed with wire
shelves of VHS tapes in plastic
squeeze boxes. There were worn
cardboard display cases of Su-

.per Nintendo games and, if you

were lucky, an adult video section
tempting your adolescent curios-
ity from behind a set of wooden
swinging doors, like some kind of

 

pornographic saloon.

Of course, 15 years later ‘and
the Hometown Videos are all but
extinct, wiped out by national
chains with in-stock guaran-
tees — corporate giants that are
now themselves feeling the pinch
from people who rent their mov-
ies on the Internet or their cable

' box. It’s hardly news that small,

independent businesses lose out
to the giants —‘ just watch *-‘‘Be
Kind Rewind” or, if you’ve got
the stomach for it, “You’ve Got
Mail.” _ A j

What might surprise_ you,
though, is that not all of them
have closed. Not yet. .

Six years ago today, a member
of a dying breed was miraculous-
ly born. "

Its name is Dreaming Ant,

and its home is the almost corni-
cally cramped back corner of
ai Crazy Mocha coffee shop in
Bloomﬁeld. The location seems
like an obvious choice _— Bloom-

Still‘, this isn’t a sad story. It

Dreaming Ant is a sign, though
-7 a testament to a nostalgic icon
that has yet to completely fade

As of today, it’s proof that
for six “years and counting we

So there it is —— that’s just for

thriller

Pitt moves to second straight Sweet I 6

by Emily Steiner l
Staﬂ Wrtter 4

Shavonte Zellous found some
help from her teammates in the

. second round of women’s NCAA
Tournament play Monday night as -

the Pitt women’s basketball team
beat Gonzaga 65-60 en route to
its second straight Sweet 16.

In one of the closest games the
Panthers played ‘all year, Zellous
scored 24 points to lead the
Panthers after scoring only two in
the first half. Fellow senior Xenia
Stewart contributed 12 points
and three assists, along with. 10
points and seven rebounds from
freshman Shawnice “Pepper”
Wilson.

Early turnovers, foul trouble
for Zellous and a struggling Pitt
offense led to an early 9-0 run
from Gonzaga, which has never
been to the Sweet 16., Zellous had
two early fouls and was taken out
of the game ﬁve minutes in.

Pitt ended the Bulldogs’ run
 back—to—back 3—pointers

from Stewart and Shayla Scott, _

bringing Pitt back  one, 9-8.

It regained a 10-9 lead withva layup

from Chelsea Cole.

The game remained close for
most of the half with Pitt retaining
the lead throughout. Zellous, who
was obviously frustrated, struggled
offensively when she came back
on the court, shooting just 1 for 6
with two points and four rebounds
in the first half.

With four minutes to go in
the ﬁrst half, Pitt raised its lead
to seven, the largest of the game,
after shots from Wilson and
Sophronia Sallard, bringing the
score to 24-17. ‘

Pitt’s defense, namely two
important blocks by Cole, limited
Gonzaga’s scoring toinothing for
seven minutes. But the Bulldogs
made a run" in the half ’s waning
minutes.

With five seconds to go in the
half, a Sallard turnover led to a
Gonzaga layup, leaving the score
tied 24-24 at halftime.

Zellous tied the game back up
at 31 with two free throws. After
scoring only two in the first half,
Zellous, Pitt’s all—time single-
season leading scorer, scored five
in the opening minutes of the
second half.

Despite a better scoring
performance, the game got
physical and more Panthers found
themselves in foul trouble, as Scott
got early personal and technical
fouls after blocking a shot from
Janelle Bekkering. Sallard and
Zellous each committed fouls
soon after.

Scott ended. the game with
seven points and eight rebounds.

With _Gonzaga up 47-44, Pitt
went on a 7-0 run, giving Pitt a
four—point lead, the biggest of
the half. The Bulldogs answered
quickly and gained a 52-51 lead.

With less than one minute left
in the game, it looked like the
win could go -either way when
Bekkering, expecting to make
contact with Zellous while going
for a shot, traveled and turned
the ball over to Pitt. Gonzaga’s
Courtney Vandersloot missed a
3—pointer and Zellous and Stewart
each went 2—of-2 at the free—throw
line in the final seconds for the
victory.

The Panthers resume action
on Sunday against the winner
of Tuesday’s game’ between
Oklahoma and Georgia Tech. _

Determining A-Rod’s   I

Senior Staﬂ Writer.

 

Surely by now you’ve seen the pictures
Alex ‘Rodriguez took forDetails magazine.

‘ The photos brought A—Rod some much

needed attention last week when they first

-popped up on the Internet. The most popular

is one of Rodriguez in a skin—tight blue'tank

top facing a mirror, with his lips laying the '

faintest, most gentle kiss upon his own lips.
There’s another of A-Rod on a mattress in

I a white tank top,.and he’s-lifting the top off, ,

exposing his -lower belly region. And this
photo shoot took place the dayafter he was

told Sports Illustrated was about to run a

story that exposed his steroid use.

The day after the photo shoot, Rodriguez
supposedly called Jason Gay, who wrote
the article, frantically asking him "to take

something out of the story. As all of‘
' Rodriguez7s accomplishments were about to

be tarnished forever, what was bothering him
so much?

He wanted to make sure Gay didn’t

mention A-Rod’s favorite song_by Madonna, ,
to whom ‘Rodriguez wasromantically linked '

last year. In interviews since the story broke,
Gay won’tiname the song, claiming he gave
his word to A—Rod, who said he was afraid
opposing teams -would play the song in their

stadiums. . *
-Of course, the. big question is what is

the song that freaked A—Rod out? \X/ell, non— ,

Yankees teams, let’s work this out so you can
embarrass Rodriguez to the point where he
cries while standing at third base.

“Like A Prayer” — This certainly seems I‘
V like a strong possibility based on a few choice

lyrics. First off: “I hear you call my name, /

favorite Madonna song I

And it feels like home.” It’s no secret that

' A—Rod just wants to_be loved. Also: “In the
midnight hour I can feel your power” is what -

A—Rod‘could possibly say to himself after
injecting steroids, because they really start to
kick in around midnight.

One reason it might not be this song,
though, is the inclusion of prayer. Like I
said, A—Rod wants to be universally adored.

Atheists and non—praying people like sports,

and purchase merchandise or whatever
products he endorses. . W _
“Into The Groove” - Can’t you just
picture A—Rod iI1_tl1C midst of a hot streak,
hitting everything anyone can throw at him,

-coming home after a game and dancing
to this song? Most likely, he’s in front of a'

mirror while doing some sort of dance where

he rotates his shoulders and arms around '

while snapping along with thebeat, ’

“Like A Virgin’? — Once again, check
out these lyrics: “I was beat incomplete. / I’d
been had, I was sad and blue, / But you.made

me feel. / Yeah, you made me feel / Shiny I I

and new,” Hmm, what could help A—Rod feel
shiny and new? Maybe these lyrics will make
it clearer:‘“You’re so fine and you’re mine. /
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold. 
Oh your love thawed out, / Yeah, your love
thawed out / What was scared and cold.”
Are you serious? It’s like Madonna’s not
only a hit~making machine ‘who can reinvent

' her image almost yearly, she’s a prophet!

Steroids make you stronger, and can warm the
body even when sticking a cold, cyst—inducing
syringe into your hip. Plus, when A-Rod’s in
the playoffs, he plays timidly and his-at-bats
don’t last long, just like a, well, you get it.

“4 Minutes” - One of Madonna’s newer . .

songs, so it’s probably not it. Also, A-Rod
wouldn’t like seeing his potential woman

it.
“Material Girl” — In all likelihood, it’s

- not this one, but I would donate an organ

tomorrow if it came out that this was his
favorite song. Seriously. -
“Papa Don’t Preach” — This is a tough

including a double play, backed Baker’s bid.
The opening conference—play sweep

loomed for Pitt, but Cincinnati topped the

Panthers in the ﬁnal game of the weekend,

' 9-5. The loss snapped Pitt’s six—game 

streak. . ,
Scoring the game’s first four runs, Cincin-

- nati jumped to _the lead, but Pitt clawed its’
.way back to tie the game in the bottom of
the third. A

. The Bearcats retook the. momentum,
however, and rolled along with timely hitting
and strong defensive play to knock off the

‘Panthers. A
Despite the one loss, Pitt stands in good '

position at 11-6 overall for the year and 2-1
in the Big East. ,

I Pitt will travel to Akron today at 3 p.m.
before another ﬁVe—game homestand there-
after, including non—conference contests with

. Youngstown State and Akron. and a three-

game set with. Big East opponent Notre
Dame this weekend at Trees Field.

and deciding to keep her baby, which sends
a_ positive message to the kids. Conversely,
some might see this as A—Rod giving his

stance on the abortion issue, and he doesn’t .

want: to do anything to make people dislike
him. Working out well, no? V
_ “Erotica” —' This song might be more
famous for a grainy music video that featured
lots of suggestive behavior and partial nudity,
to which A—Rod’s photo shoot could be seen
as an homage. But how about these lyrics:

  ‘Vogueimight be the leader heading toithe clubhouse

“There’s. a certain satisfaction / In a little bit
of pain.” Sound like anything A—Rod might
know about? '.
‘_‘Vogu_e” — This has to _be a favorite, if
only because A—Rod clearly likes posing and
 is the posing anthem. It also‘ mentions
Joe DiMaggio, and hey, he was a Yankee.
“Justify My‘ Love” — -See: “Material
Gir,.’.’ . 4
“American Pie” — Here’s how I picture
this playing out in a clubhouse. A—Rod walks

. ‘ ~ . ‘g >
in, hears the Don McLean version of the song ’

and asks, “Hey, who’s this old guy playing the
depressing version of that Madonna song?”
So yeah, Pd say this is in the

-n.

at baseball stadiums. See which you think it J

is. Now, let’s just hope A-Rod’s Madonna

ﬁxation only spreads to her music, and Details
doesn’t have a picture of him hitchhiking

- naked. Or worse, wearing one of those cone
bras under his Yankees jersey.
