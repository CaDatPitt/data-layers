Seniors Take Podium S.G. To Aid Baseball Team
In Effort to Obtain Funds

At Tap Day Ceremonies
To‘OpenUp’University

by ANNE DORN
(See Linda Goldste2'n’s Tap Day Ad'd'ress——Page 4)

The 1968 Tap Day ceremonies Wednesday turned into a New
England style town-meeting when Loren Hershey and John Ruskay,
both graduating seniors, bounded unexpectedly onto the stage and
announced they were giving students the “chance to talk.”

Hershey and Ruskay interrupted the Ceremonies after Linda
Goldstein, editor of The Pitt News, finished her keynote address.
They demanded 20 minutes to “open up this school,” reasoning that
most of the student and many of the administrative leaders were
present to hear student complaints.

Ruskay emphasized that Miss Goldstein presented a “great
speech,” and that she openly stated what must be said about Uni-
versity. affairs for the first time. He challenged, however, students
to “step out of their molds” and to defy the standard schedule for
just a few minutes to say what was on their minds. He urged the
student body to try to emulate the atmosphere of the medieval uni-
versity by regaining its dignity. _

William Weber came up to the podium to speak and received a
round of applause from a number of students. He began to speak but
was stopped by chairman of the Tap Day ceremonies Paul Stoller.
Stoller eventually relinquished the microphone, prompting Rich
Peters, member of the Young Republicans, to step up and cry that
Tay Day is “not a debate.”

passed a bill last night
which will aid the baseball
team in their effort to raise
money to pay traveling ex-
penses for an upcoming
tournament to be held in Cali-
fornia.

Senator Roy Jacobs introduced
the bill, which was passed unani-
mously. The bill stated that SG
purchase a block of tickets, the
number of which will be recom-
mended by the executive, for a

rafﬂe that the team is sponsor-
ing.

The bill mentioned that other
organizations and students may
follow _SG’s example, and aid the
team in raising some $1000 need-
ed to make the trip to California.

Also passed was a bill resolv-
ing that a symposium be held at
the University on an annual bas-
is. Senator Dave Guydan cited
that the success of symposiums
at other schools as a basis for
the need of one to be held here.

The purposes of the symposium
would be “to combine students,

Seminar Analyzes ESP

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY
“I believe everyone has the power of ESP (extra sensory per-
ception) but not everyone is fit to have it,” said Marilyn Eastman,
an actress who spoke at the student-faculty seminar on ESP Wednes-

day night.

The seminar is the second of a series called “New Trips in

Space.”

“When you have ESP,” Miss Eastman said, “it changes the whole
course of your life. It makes you a medium, which is a disturbing

thingto be.’-'

She pointed out that “it can be fun having ESP experiences, but

terms at Wednesday night’s Tap
Day Banquet.

Belly offered a challenge to
the students which he didn’t think
the liiiiversity “is up to.” Pro-
fessor Lee's challenge was one
of “justice and maturity for all
men to which I ask you to com-
mit yourself.”

In sharply criticizingmthe Uni-
versity, Belly listed three major
areas where change is needed
(1) a second campus newspaper;
(.2) the abolishment of student
government and (3) a change in

_ attitude of everyone “in this room

and this university."-’

But University has failed to

people who try to stop students."
Fugo said that he had “no en-
thusiasm in the school.”

Frank Courvares, who was to
receive a Junior Worthy Award,
spoke next. “We shouldn’t be
putting up a facade of honoring
students,” he claimed, and de-
clined his award.

The Alpha Epsilon Delta Award
to the outstanding senior pre-
medical student was awarded to
Ronald Cohen. Daniel Booker won
the Pi Delta Epsilon Medal of
Merit. The Ben J. Lubic Award
for good citizenship went to Ken-
neth Huber, and Randi Hurowitz

Jamie Ginsberg, a senior psychology major at the University,

related several of her ‘psychic experiences. She cited dreams which

turned out to be predictive, such as in the case of Kennedy’s assass-

lection committee.

SG president Ken Schueler,
meeting with the newly elected
senate for only the second time,
expressed disatisfaction with the
applications for chairmanships of
certain committees.

Schueler stressed the responsi-
bility of the senators to bring in
capable students to apply for the
position of chairman on impor-

tant committees. Schueler how- .

ever, did find some capable stu-

dents for certain positions, and

12 students were elected to com-
mittees by the senate.

Dave Knopf, Ken Weiss, and
Diane Ulyon were nominated and
elected as voting members of the
recognition committee. Paul Stol-
ler and Chuck Green were elect-
ed as non-voting members.

Stew Lowenthal was elected as
director of finance; Jane Fenten
was elected as director of re-
search; and, Lenny Baxt was
elected as activities coordinator.
Baxt’s main duty will be to im-
prove» the quality of entertain-
ment for events such as Winter
Weekend and Homecoming.

Cherl DiPaolo was elected as A

recording secretary; Vic Willem
was elected as parliamentarian;

and Linda Cahan was appointed,

to the library committee.
Joanne Telerico, chairman of

an “ad hoc” SG committee for a

reception to be held in honor of

the College Bowl team, reported-

ination.

Dr. Janos Schrossberger, visiting professor of psychiatric medi-
cine at the Medical School, stated that “many things start in an un-

scientific way and later become
scientiﬁc. We must get concrete
evidence before judging ESP."

He went on to say that “may-
be ESP is a more innocent state
of mind, such as characterizes
the minds of children. Perhaps
the reason most scientists cannot
accept the existence of ESP is
that they are a function of their
time and are compelled to think
along certain lines.”

Exhibit of Miller Drawings

The Committee on the Arts of the Student Union is n6'vi‘r showing
an art exhibit in the new gallery on the ground floor of the Student

The exhibit includes twenty-nine pen and inks, drawn by J’.
Howard Miller, an artist in Glenshaw, Pennsylvania. The subjects‘
of the sketches are streets and scenes in the Pittsburgh area. "I just

challenge of the times.”

Conc ern'i n g student govern-
ment, Belly added that it should
concern itself with instruction of
students. “There are some in-
competent faculty members here
and we should havea say in get-
ting rid of these people,” he re-
iterated.

Belly bluntly expressed his de-
sire for an attitude of free speech
and presented a challenge to the
distribution of literature law in
the men’s dormitories. “I don't
care what anyone thinks of me,
I’m going to do what I can on
this issue in the future,” he prom-
ised.

Professor Lee, in following Bel-
ly, sarcastically commented on
specific remarks by Belly. “I've
been inspired by what went be-
fore me," he began, “but by what
you've said I'm surprised that
the pillars of this building aren't
fallinz down.”

After referring to Belly’s speech
as a “brilliant undergraduate pro-
duction,” Professor Lee warned
students of the dangers of vio-

‘Fanny Hill’ Fine Example

Taube Probes Pornography

“Fannie Hill is undoubtedly one of
the finest examples of pornographic
literature in history,” began Dr. My-
ron ‘Taube in his lecture on the uses
and abuses of pornographic literature.
"it is very elegantly written, has a
certain artistic aire, and, of couse,
numerous pornographic adventures.
“Fannie Hill is a prostitute, and has
those qualities we expect to find in
one. It is an intellectual and pictures-
que wandering of a woman from one
sexual experience to another."

Taube ascerted that Fannie Hill,
and in fact all pornography, is n_ot
realistic. He said the more unrealistic
it is the better it is. Its chief aim is
to take you away from rezrity. “It
is unreal in the fact that anyone hav-
ing as many experiences as Fannie
would have to become pregnant. Fan-

ini_e’s unbelievablity is seen in the

~ stories of how she was deflowered.

Dr. Taube pointed out that although
is is pornographic you will not find
one dirty word in Fannie Hill.“There
is not a damn, a darn, or a drat in
thebook." He said that this seems to
dehumanize the people until they
seem almost not to be human beings
at all, but mechanisms, ‘or engines of
love.

Taube showed that the book had a
surprising quality of democracy, be-

cause Fannie didn’t measure people
by class or outward qualities, but by
how good a lover they were. In fact,
Fannie worshipped men and used very
idealistic adjectives in describing them.
He pointed out that the novel also had
a very definite plot, sex notwithstand-
mg.

“But even though the book has all
these things in it," said Taube, “it is
still pornographic, and the question
remains, should we allow this type of
novel to be read." Some say this type
of literature warps peoples‘ minds,
and therefore, should not be read.
“But if this is the case," .as Dr. Taube
pointed out, “One could easily say
that Chaucer’t or Shakespeare's works
should also go on trial, or anyone who
has tried to deal with human condi-
tions." » ‘

In defense of pornographic litera-
ture, Dr. Taube pointed out that even
the Bible had some pornography in it.
“If you define pornography as some
written material about something dir-
ty, or-about sex, I don't think that you
would want your children to pattern
themselves after Adam and Eve walk-

don't think that fig-leaf was a very

Dr. Taubes feeling‘as to the choice
of reading novels like Fannie Hill_ is
that it is up to the individual. As to
those people who feel that this sort of
writing warps the mind. he says, "Tlie
written word isn't really as powerful
as many people seem to think. It is
written in tablets of stone ‘Thou shalt
not steal,‘ and "l'hou shalt not covet
thy neighbors wife,‘ but people still
go around doing these thihgs. So,"
concluded Dr. Taube, "It is entirely
up to the individual to decide if nov-
els like Fannie Hill really will hard-
en his heart and damn his soul."

Probes ESP Experiences

(Continued from Page 1)

He added that “years ago peo-
ple would not believe that eclips-
es could be predicted. Right now,
ESP cannot be predicted, but it
may become a regular phenome-
non in the future.”

Dr. Edward Waldman, director
of education at Mercy Hospital,
has an- interest in ESP as an
agent for ameliorating a person’s
health. “I believe in ESP and
I’ll put my career on the line to
teach it,” he said.

Dr. Daryl J. Bem, associate
professor of psychology and in-
dustrial administration’ at Car-
negie - Mellon University, was
“the skeptic of the group.”

Dr. Bem does demonstrations
in mental telepathy for his class-
es, all of which he can explain
by natural methods. “The ma.-
jority of Americans believe in
ESP, although the majority of
psychologists feel that the evi-
dence is not yet sufficient for the
credibility of ESP.”

He clarified his stand by say-
ing that “I am not accusing any-
one of being a fraud; I just think
that there must be an experiment
that can be repeated under lab-

Dr. Bem explained the “Las

Linda Go1dstein’s Tap Day Address

When I first began to write this ad-
dressk I had decided to center it around
the student politics that are reflected
in the selection of the key Tap Day
Awards. But then I realized how wrong

it would bd to highlight an issue that

is really insignificant in discussing
the impact of politics on our lives to-
day, we cannot limit our discussions to
student politics. We cannot ignore the
far more vital politics that affect us
as students at a state-related" Universi-
ty, nor can we ignore the national po-
litical scene where our nation’s com-
mitment in Vietnam has precipitated
an unprecedented call of college stu-
dents to serve in our armed fores.

H Those of us who came as freshmen
in Sdptember of 1964 will soon be
graduating from this institution. For
it is such a different world
from 1964 in so many respects that
it is difficult to accept that so much
has happened in less than four years.
For in our freshman year, the most
active political organization on cam-

'pus was the Students for Johnson-

‘ Humphrey. Today’s students are turn-

spiration that Lyndon Johnson has

failed to give them. Four years ago,

a new campus political group, the
Pitt Progressive Party, was fromed.
This year, those same students who
rallied to the liberal PPP worked for

abolish Student Government. The PPP

A as a force, working to create a viable

and powerful Student Government, is

dead.

’ Four years ago, we students were
enrolled in a University that was her-
alded by many as approaching the
status of ,a great institution. Today,
our University is as the mercy of a
state legislature that even denies us

the security of knowing whether or

not we will meet our operating ex-
penses. The feeling of hope and en-
couragement we experienced fou r
years ago has dissipated, to be re-
placed by a sense of futility. Too
many of us show by our actions that
we adhere to the phirosophy that -
why should we bother trying? Our

efforts will only be in vain. We can-

not even be optimistic about the fate
of our University, a school that made

I A phenomenal strides in the ten years

preceding our matriculation. For we
just do not know what the full impli-
cations of state-relatedness will be:
all we know is that in 1965, 38 per
cent of the freshman class represented
other states and other nations. Last
fall’s class had but eight per cent who
were not from Pennsylvania. We know

, that the new dormitories that were

supposed to be nearing completion by
now as of yet do not even an approved

site. Our school is one more becoming

the commuter school it was years ago,

"”‘as we just do not have enough dormi-

tory space to do anything but say,

 when the new dormitories are built,

this will change. But there is little

we can believe is what we see, and

 what we see is that our student body

into a university cooperative, such as
now exists at such schools as Cornell,
Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Four
years later, we are still trying to
achieve a students’ book center and
we are stymied in our attempts. No
wonder there is a sense of futility and
hopelessness: our goals are virtually
impossible to achieve at this Universi-
ty. I know, for I sat on the book cen-
ter policy committee this summer as
one of three student representatives.

I sat and listended to the commit-
tee unanimouly agree on a ten per
cent student discount for all textbooks
to begin last September. I sat and list-
ened to an administrator promise to
work on carrying lines of soft goods
in the Student Union, the profits of
which would help defray the cost of
this student discount. What happened?

’We were told shortly before Septem-

ber that there was no provision in the
budget for the ten per cent discount
because the fiscal year had already be-
gun. We were told this, although the
two highest ranking administrators in
finance had sat on that committee
while our agreement was reached. We
were expected to believe that they
were unaware that there was no pro-
vision in the budget for this discount,
and we were asked to accept a water-
ed-down A version of our proposal, a
ten per cent discount on only hard-
covered textbooks beginning in Janu-
ary, one term later than the original
agreement. Now we are told by a high
ranking administrator that the book
center is losing money and there is a
real possibility that the administra-
tion will have to‘ revoke the discount.

We are told to accept that the one
small gain we made, the results of
months of painstaking investigation
and lenghty discussion, will in all
probability be taken from us. No won-
der there is a feeling of frustration:
how can we feel anything else when
our attempts to prove and research
our case have no correlation to the re-
sults we achieve. We'll lose in the end
anyway, for we must take what we are
given. But do we have to accipt this?
Why shouldn’t we employ such tactics
as boycotting this book center that
serves us only after serving the com-
munity at large? For how many years
must we accept defeat withour active-
ly and openly defending our rights?
The odds for success are against us,
but by acquiesing we lose all, and
that is far too dangerous a risk to take.

Unfortunately, far too many stu-
dents have accepted defeat. When a
group such as the Pitt Progressive par-
ty works year after year to build Stu-
dent Government, then disbands as its
workers rally to a candidatd running

_on a platform to abolish Student Gov-

ernment, are we not in effect accept-
ing defeat? For we are cutting off a
recognized channel to represent the
students. But in a way we cannot
blame those students, for year after
year they have gotten shut out of vic-
tory, as students who all too frequent-
ly accepted compromise won the vic-
tories. How long can people be expect-
ed to fight a losing battle?

But the battles the PPP may have

lost year after ‘year in Student Gov-' 

ernment races are miniscule compared

year graduate students on this cam-
pus are now fighting so that they may
be allowed to continue their educa-
tion. With the new draft regulations,
these students must sit through the
painful process of waiting each day to
see what their mail will bring them.
They do now know where they will be
next fall, all because of a national
commitment in Vietnam in which the
majority of them do not even believe.
Four years ago many of them were
strong supporters of President John-
son, just as a Eugene McCarthy also
stood by our President. But four years
ago, these students’ futures were not
threatened as they are today. Four
years ago, they had every intention of
completing thelN education. Today,
they must decide wheteher to enlist
in Officers’ Candidate School or find
another alternative preferable to wait-
ing to be drafted. And all this agony
is for a war which an ever-increasing
number of Americans strongly oppose.
No one can say that our generation has
never known war: we now know war
at its worst, for it is a war so many of
us cannot’ justify. This is the saddest
tragedy of all facing our graduating
class, being caught ih a trap from
which there is no relief. And our na-
tion is paying vitally for this commit-
ment, as the number of educated peo-
ple will continue to be drastically re-
duced. A predicted ten-year setback
in Ph.D. output is but one indication
of A the catastrophic effect the new
draft regulations will have on the aca-
demic community of the United States.

 Andlin our disheartened state, we

can recall the words of the poet John
Greenleaf Whittier: of all sad words
of tongue or pen, the saddest are these:
“It might have been.” For we were
optimistic four years ago, optimistic
about achieving goals at our universi-
ty, encouraged about the heights this
university would attain, and hearten-
ed by the liberal platform of Lyndon
Johnson. It is hard to comprehend
that four years have brough so much
disillusionment. Everywhere we turn,

our hopes have not been fulfilled. It

is easy to see why so many students
have become embittered and alienat-
ed: they have more than enough rea-
sons to justify such an attitude.

But we must remember that just
because there are so many circum-
stances to justify our feeling of dis-
pair, we still do not have to accept the
status quo without trying to change
current conditions. We can still join
an organization kile Hill Education
Project and avail ourselves of the op-
portunity to bring something to the
lives of these underprivileged children
which is sorely lacking: an inspiration
that there can be hope for a better life.
We can participate in a Students for
McCarthy movement to fight for the
causes in which we believe. We do
not have to sit on the sidelines even
at our own school and watch those
whose motives are aimed more to-
ward recognition than achievement
become our student leaders. Passivity
can never be justified. We cannot
change the course of the world, but
if we make a small inroad, we have
taken that first step toward altering
what we cannot accept.

As John F. Kennedy once said,
“The credit belongs to the man is ac-
tually in the arena: whose face is mar-
red with dust and sweat and blood,
who if he wins, knows the thrills of
high achievemnet, and if he fails,
fails while daring greatly, so that his
place will never be among those cold
and timid sjouls who know neither
victory nor defeat.” Let us heed those
words and remember that the high
price we may pay for victory in terms
of time andienergy can reap the kind
of satisfaction that complacency can

different t an it was four years ago,
and the odds against achieving con-
crete goals may seem almost impos-
sible. But once we stop trying, :we
have committed the worst sin of all:
we have accepted a fate which we
cannot justify to ourselves. We have
lost hope. And by our resignation we
have reinforced all that we detest, en-
suring that things will only worsen.

If one thing must happen in 1968,
it is that we leave behind us the aphor-
ism--“why bother tyring.” Let this
Univdrsity cease to be a place which
shields and prtects cold and timid
souls. Let us dare and dare greatly.
It is not only our highest duty: it is
our greatest hope.

As Timmons Retires

Cagers Down CMU

by MIKE BROURMAN, Assistant Sports Editor

It took Bob Timmons more than a half day to find the right
combination against Carnegie-Mellon, .and, as it turned out, two
“.forgotten" men sparked the Panthers to a 85-74 comeback vic-

tory.

Ken Bollens and Len Kalata, who
have spent a lot of time languishing
on the bench lately, led the charge
which vaulted the cager( from a 36-
30 halftime deficit to a l0‘point lead
midway through the second half.

Bollens finished with 13 points, and

Kalata had nine, but their most val-
uable contributions were hustle and
heads-up play. Registering over a doz-
en steals between them, they contri-
buted innumerable assists, and hit the
boards hard.
/For Bollens, the victory was espe-
cially sweet, sine the senior co-cap-
tain was closting out his career. “It
felt good to "play again,” he smiled.
“I was more nervous than usual this
afternoon, and I didn't think I was
going to play much. It felt good.”

Guards Tony DeLisio and co-cap-
tain Pete Smith, ‘also playing his fi-
nal game for the Panthers, also turn-
ed in outstanding performances. De-
Lisio scored 24 points, and Smith net-

Cubs End Season With

Unimpressive Victory

by JERRY GRUEBEL

T h e freshman basketball
team ended a long season of
bad breaks Wednesday night
beatih- the Carnegie-Mellon ]Vs, 86-
49. But the score was in no way rep-
résentative of the way the Cubs play-
ed.

"The kids got an early lead," ex-
plained freshman basketball coach Tim
Grgurich, “and then they started play-
ing as if it didn’t matter."

That's the was it seemed. It probably
wouldn't have made a difference if
less than five players showed up in
Pitt uniforms either. And that almost
happened.

Forward Tom Withers who pured in
27 points in his lat game against West
Virginia's Little Mountaineers, watch-
ed the game from the scorers’ table in
street clothes. He was nursing a sprain-
ed ankle.

On his right was 6-6 Bob Gailus,
keeping the official book. Calcium de-
posits has changed Callus’ role from
star of the frosh cagers to official
scorer.

.“We’ve been running a ‘hospital
ward all season,” complained Crgu-
rich. “Look at tonight’s game—two of
my five starters couldn't even play.”

Earlier in the season, guard Pat Mc-

, Clellan was side-lined with a broken

leg. But against the Tartans Wednes-
day night, a healthy McClellan chip-
ped in 13 points. /

Three other players finished in dou-
ble figures in the last game of a 7-5
season. Footballer Bill Kennedy and
Billy Downes were high scorers with
14 points each. Mike Caldwell drop-
ped in ten points and Rocco F iorvanti
added nine.

Overall, however, the Cubs played
sloppy. Turnovers, unnecessary fouls,
and pur shooting dominated the ac-
tion. Y

But Crgurich remained proud of his
players.

ing to come out a loser in my last
game,” said retiring coach Timmons.
“But, after the‘first half the boys
knew they had to play ball to win, and
they came through."

Timmons credited . CMU with a
good first half performance. "They
hustled and shot well. They were
finding thd open spots against our
zone.“ »

So. in the second half the Pan“
thers swithced to a man-to-man clog-
ged up the open areas, and Timmons,
Bollens, and"Smith finished on a win-
ning note.

varsity and freshmen grapplers. The varsity hosts deceptive Sy-
racuse at Trees Hall tomorrow at 11 a.m. while the frosh visit
Annapolis tonight and tomorrow for the Navy Plebes Invitational
Tournament.

Syracuse is rebuilding its wrestling team this season and is
sophomore dominated this season. As a result, they lost six of their
first seven meets, defeating only Cortland State. Still, coach Dave
Adams reserves judgment on the visitors. ‘

“Their talent is better than their record," remarked Adams.
“The talent they have is pretty good. They supposedly had the best
freshman team in the East last year.

“We’re about the same as they are," Adams continued. “We’ve
got a good chance to beat them. It depends on how far their sopho-
mores have come."

Tomorrow’s outcome also
grapplers Bruce Unangst and Ron Schuchert have

dicated Adams. The coach added that, if necessary, Ron Reicheld-

erfer will replace Unangst at 123 and Ken Case will sub for Schuch-If

ert at 145.

Meanwhile, the freshmen welcome back a key wrestler to ac-
tion for the Plebe tournament, Buddy Morris. Morris, Jack Hopkins,
Mark Payne, Pat Lavery, Pat Lavery, Bob Kuhn, Gene Reese, and
Ralph Cindrich have been entered.

lnicdently, Morris will compete
least two classes above normal weight.

“Buddy will give a good account of himself,” figured Adams.
“He's not in the best of shape, but the main idea is to get him ex-
perienced.”

“These state teachers’ colleges usually have one or two out-
standing boys," warned frosh coach Bob Fehrs. “But the type of
boys we have here have great individual pride that will have him
working for himself and then for the team."

‘ Referring to the varsity again, Adams was worried that the 11
a.m. starting time might hold down the Trees Hall crowd. He ex-
pressdd the hope that students would come up and perhaps provide
some extra spark in his squads’ (ginal dual meet.
