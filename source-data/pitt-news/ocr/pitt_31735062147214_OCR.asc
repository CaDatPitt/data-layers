Cass Announces
‘Show-Off’ Cast;
Parks Gets Lead

Pitt Players’ First Production
Of Year Is Famous Comedy
By Proliﬁc George Kelly

John Parks, BA36, has won the
ﬁrst Pitt Players lead of the year.
Carolyn Hall, Ed36, and Margaret
Lewis, C36, will play the leading"
feminine rolls in “The Show-Off,”
three-act comedy written by George
Kelly. '
Other roles have gone to Richard
Frankel, C39, John Weisbrod, C38,
Chalmers Brown, C37, Raymond Mc-
Intyre, C38, and Robert Madden, C37.

Selection of the cast is announced
by Carl B. Cass, associate professor
of English and director of the student
dramatic organization. Tryouts were
conducted last week, ending late Fri-
day aftenoon.

“The S-how-Off” is one of a number
of hit comedies by Kelly, who wrote
“-Craig’s Wife,” and “The Torchbear-
ers,” plays produced by the Players
over the past few years. Pitt Players
annually produces three major plays.

Miss Lewis, cast opposite Parks,
may not be able to accept the part be-
cause of excess activity points. If her
eligibility can be established, however,
she will retain the role.

Semi-Annual Bio’ Total Dilemma
Finds Sage Seidie Prepared Again

Braver than the freshman who at-
tempts to accept four conﬂicting invi-
tations for the same evening, N. Rob-
ert Seidle, assistant to the dean of
men, has ventured forth with his sec-
ond annual fall fraternity pledging
estimates. Although a tense air of
competition prevails around the office,
none of these who so ably congratu-
lated him upon his guesses last year,
have, as yet, come forward with their
prognostications.

Mr. Seidle estimates that 565 bids
will be extended by the 16 fraternities
involved in the present rushing pro-
gramto 380 men, and that 165 bids
will be accepted. Last October, Mr.
Seidle made his estimates “wildly,”
and was far off from the actual re-
sults. Some justification for the poor
guess lies in the fact that he had just
been appointed as assistant to the
dean of men in charge of fraternities.
In the spring estimates, however, he
guessed exactly the number of accept-
ances.

Mr. Seidle has smarted under the
stigma of his fall attempt for one full

Pre-Ed Students  
File Applications

Education School Sets November
1 As Deadline For Interviews

All pre-education sophomores and
other students who have earned or
will have earned 60 credits by Feb-
1-uary, must apply for admission to
the School of Education this month,
Theodore A. Siedle, assistant to the
dean, announced today. Applications
must be ﬁled in Room 210, State Hall,
on or before November 1.

“If a student is planning to prepare
for teaching,” Mr. Siedle said, “he
should complete his degree in the
School of Education, and if he has
completed or is completing 60 credits
or more by February he should ap-
ply for admission at this time.”

At the close of the application
period, complete information about
applicants will be tabulated and re-
viewed by a committee 011 admissions.
Each student will then be interviewed
by the committee. , . , '

Among the items'c.ons'idered’in rat-
ing pre-education applicants are
health, intelligence test score, general
quality point average, quality point
average in the major ﬁeld, personal-
ity, and interview rating.

Students who are in doubt about
their status should make inquiry at
the ofﬁce of the dean, Room 210, State
Hall.

New Instructor
In Engineering
Beats Handicap

Although adversity has visited
Latham Yates, new instructor in oil
and gas engineering at the Univer-
sity, it has not swerved him in the
slightest from his chosen career.

During the spring of his fourth year
as an undergraduate at the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma, he was charging a
cannon with power at an engineers’
St. Patrick’s Day celebration. The
powder prematurely exploded and the
resultant injuries deprived him of the
use of both hands.

Undaunted, the young engineer mas-
tr:-red the use of a pair of specially
constructed mechanical hands, ﬁn-
ished his college year and then went
on to obtain his master’s degree.

With the passing of time, his man-
ipulation of the mechanical hands has
enabled him to keep pace with other
individuals. He can write, illustrate
problems on the blackboard and run
a calculating machine. Without any
mid other than the manufactured hands,
Yates is able to dress, shave and
drive a car.

year. Taunted by the loss of an inter-
department wager, this year he has
made “a scientiﬁc and more expe-
rienced guess.”

Evidently frightened by the fact
that revenge has been burning in Mr.
Seidle’s eyes for the last few weeks,
the usual competitors in this game of
estimation have failed to make public
their ﬁgures. The victor of last year
(name withheld by special request),
has declined to make a public bid, but
admits that she is willing to wager
in private.. Editorial note: There is
a brand of cigars known as Factory
Throwouts which can be purchased
for less than a dollar for a box of
ﬁfty; and candy can be bought for as
cheap as 29 cents a pound ‘in boxes).

Mr. Theodore Biddle, assistant to
the dean of men and formerly in
charge of fraternities, has not yet
made his estimates. He wants more
time. But, unless his bids are turned
in before this is printed, it will have
to go down in the records as a default,
It looks like an open ﬁeld for Mr.
Seidle.

Transfer Women
To Attend Dinner
Today As Guests

Upperclass Hostess To Creet
New Students With Informal
Gathering At Heinz I-louse

Forty-four transfer women will be
the guests of the University at an
informal dinner at Heinz House to-
night at 5:30 o’clock. Ten upper-
class women will attend the dinner

in the role of hostesses and to in-
troduce themselves as members or
the transfer council of women stu-
dents.

The council will consist of the pres-
ident, social chairman, and one other
member of each of the three upper
classes, and the WCEL representa-
tive of WSGA. The members will help
the new students to become better ac-
quainted on the campus and will in-
troduce to them the traditions and
customs of life at this University.

According to the program arranged
for the transfers, they will be divided
into small groups, each group being
headed by a counselor who will thus
be enabled to have a closer friend.-
ship with the newcomer and person-
ally bring her into the activities of
the University.

Almost all of the new students have
come from Pennsylvania colleges and
universities, there being only eight
who have formerly attended out-of-
state institutions. Approximately one-
ﬁfth of the women have transferred
to the University from the University
Extension -Center at Johnstown, which
contributed nine former students.

One of the newcomers has traveled A
College in Tennessee, and one from
the northern University of Western
Ontario. Four of the women were
enrolled in Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology last year.

Kathryn Hardy, C37, is general
chairma_n of the transfer council, and
Doris Fuhs, Ed37, is in charge of ar-
ranging the program for the group.

Janet Hallock, C37, Rose Nugent.
C37, Mary Gealy, Ed37, Margaret
Speer, Ed36, and Betty Rieger, Ed37,
will assist Miss Fuhs. A committee
appointed to select a suitable name
for the council includes Helenclaire
Goldsberry, C38, and Alice Musel.
Ed36. Ruth Thielman has been chosen
secretary of the group.

Zoology Graduates Given

zoology at Union College.

‘We’re In Favor  It,’ Say C
Freshmen Regarding Rushing

Inquiring Reporter Finds
To Greater Part: Of

Freshmen are groping around the
campus this week in a state some-
where between wonderment and be-
wilderment. An inquiring reporter of
The Pitt News succeeded Friday in
rescuing several of the rushees from
the unrelentless hounding of the fra-
ternity men to gather the following
impressions of the fraternity rushing
season:

Leonard Quint, BA: “It’s a great
way to meet a lot of fellows.”

Howard Krell, C: “Just too bad
there are only 24 hours to a day.”

Robert Brown, C: “They take up a
lot of time but they’re worth it.”

Milton Lehman, C: “I wonder if I’ll
be as important in two weeks as the
1-ushers would have me believe I am
now.”

Bernard McKenna, C: "It’s a splen-
did opportunity for all the members
of the freshman class to get a super-
ﬁcial glimpse of fraternities.”

Mansfield lHyat‘d, C: “I think the
whole idea is great stuff.”

Stanley Markey, C: “I think it’s the
most gloriﬁed period in the college
life. It gives a freshman self-conﬁ-
dence and the will to succeed in both
activities and scholarship.”

Mack Milliken, ChE: “Undoubtedly
it’s a ﬁne idea.”

Sam Marcus, C: “Pretty swell. It’s
a great idea!”

Fred Mccamic, C: “I don’t know
who it’s tougher on, the rushees or
the rushers.”

Tom Dickson, E: “Good thing if you

Well-Chased Rushees

want to get something for nothing.”

Jerry Harris C: “I’m afraid I won’t
be able to plsclge this year, and so
haven't accepted any rushing invita-
tions.”

John Rice, IE: “The Oakland eat-
ing places probably don’t show much
proﬁt this week.”

Herbert Passakoff, B-A: “At least
there are plenty of people looking after
““3.i.‘i.“”.§i§§.i‘3.f.§“‘f;-f"5?i‘§.”‘§‘i;{£1 some
of the professors’ make allowances for
all this.”

Charles Conick, C: “Southern hospi-
tality looks sick by comparison.”

Michael Karolcik, M: “I haven't
been rushed yet. The fraternities are
missing a great guy.”

Francis Durkin, C: “Yes, my last
name is the same as that of Interim-
Lernity Council’s President. What?"

Arnold Schutzman, BA: “I don’t
know where to 0'0 ﬁrst.”

Joseph Daughzzarty, BA: “I’d hate to
foot the bill for some of those lunch-
eons.”

Phil Bishop, C: “Imagine! Dog races
in connection with fraternity rush-
ing!”

Probably the most capital blurb
brings a shade of grlilefs into thePpic-
ture. Tearing throng chenley art
in his orange-wheeled sedan, Bob
Kornhauser, freshman of the College,
was stopped by the iron hand of the
law. “Where’s the rush?” demand the
cop. “At the Phi Ep house,” blurted
Kornhauser as he stepped on the gas.

Rehearsal Held

Director Asks Instrumentalists
To Apply October 10

The University Orchestra held its
ﬁrst general rehearsal Thursday eve-
ning under the direction" of Lee M.
Lockhart, director of instrumental
music at the University and Theodore
W. Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men and in charge of men’s activities.

Both Lockhart and Biddle expressed
pleasure over the rehearsal and pre-

dicted a successful season ahead. Al-
though the ﬁrst turnout was fairly
large, there are still several positions
in the orchestra to be ﬁlled. Those in-
terested should attend the next rehear-
sal, scheduled for Thursday, October
10, in Room 728, Cathedral, at 7
o’clock.

New applicants are asked to report
shortly before this time in order to
talk with Director Lockhart. All in-
struments are needed and anyone may
try out. The director expressed the
hope that the orchestra would grow
so that tryouts would be on the same
competitive basis as in the University
Band. Plans are under way to pur-
chase more instruments.

At the rehearsal, several chamber
music groups were selected to repre-
sent the University at various planned
entertainments the ﬁrst of which will
be presented in behalf of the Scottish
Committee in the Commons Room of
the Cathedral, Thursday, October 17.
These groups consist of string trios,
a string quartet, and woodwind ensem-
bles.

As in the past the orchestra will con-
tinue to play at the Chancellor’s recep-
tion, for the Pitt Players production
as well as its annual home concert. Its
ﬁrst concert will be in November, al-
though the exact date has not yet been
announced.

The manager for this year is Ed-
ward Teats, IE36, assisted by Stanley
Ambrose, C38. Apprentice managers
are needed.

 

Mathematicians Hear ’

Culver Paper Today

The Mathematics Colloquium, meet-
ing tomorrow afternoon at 2:30
o’clock, will hear a paper “On Roots
of Unity,” presented by Dr. M. M.
Culver, professor of mathematics.

Tomorrow's event, the initial meet-
ing of the year, will be held in Room
104, Alumni Hall. In the future bi-
weekly meetings of the Colloquium,
papers of original research will be

read.

Committee Checks
Applicants Filling
Job Assignments

Directors To Select Men, Women,
Who Will Contribute Most
To University Work

Although approximately 30' of the
578 NYA jobs allowed the University
have yet to be ﬁlled, there will be no
corresponding decrease in the work
of the NYA committee headed by
John G, Quick, University registrar.

The present big job facing the com-
mittee is checking to see that stu-
dents are reporting for their assign-
ments. In some instances, students
have not been able to register after
being notiﬁed of their acceptance by
the committee, and, in a few cases, a
student who has registered has not
reported to Miss Isabelle Anderson,
assistant to the dean of women, or J.
C. Barton, director of the Placement
Bureau, both of whom give students
their assignments.

First or original applicants are given
two weeks to register after which
time their names will be removed
from the NYA lists and the vacancy
ﬁlled by other students. The time lim-
it, Mr. Quick believes, will probably
be shortened in order to give every
worthy and needy student an oppor-
tunity for this employment. «

In an address before the Allegheny
County Scholarship Association last
Friday afternoon, Mr. Quick discussed,
“The NYA at the University of Pitts-
bugh.” The University was l1ost to
the association at this time.

Among the many points he brought
out, Mr. Quick emphasized the fact
that this year the NYA has sought to
aid students who give promise of abil-
ity in college more so than its prede-
cessor, the FERA.

This of course entailed more work on
the part of the committee, Quick sum-
med up the steps in the administra-
tion as follows: the ﬁling of the appli-
cation by the student followed by fur-
ther inquiry and, when possible, by
personal interview.

Then came ﬁling of projects by
members of the faculty for jobs inside
the University, and outside for which
a faculty member or members stood as
sponsors. These projects were then
scrutinized to ascertain their eligibil-
ity under NYA rulings,

In his Concluding remarks, the reg-
istrar read a list of typical projects
and referred to excerpts from the let-
ters ﬁled by applicants revealing ex-
treme cases of need.

In the last of the NYA bulletins,
which was devoted to the status of
graduate students seeking- part-time
employment under this plan, the gov-
ernment stipulations 'covering this
class were presented.

After deﬁning the type of graduate
work as designed “To include activi-
ties and research of all types, super-
vised by members of the faculties
. . .” it stated that no such work
could be given if it resulted in the un-
employment of workmen formerly on
the payroll. There was a further limi-
tation, “Nor shall part-time service
include the giving of any regular class
room instruction in the University.”

Pending further word from the na-
tional Committee, only the basic aver-
age of $15 per month will be paid. In
accord with a previous announcement,
this will be increased to the larger
monthly average, as soon as authoriza-
tion is received.

Orientation Moves On
RIENTA’l‘ION PROGRAMS for freshman men
and women move into the third round tomor-
row. The new plan for men, sponsored by
Dean Lanfear and carried on by a corps of fac-
ulty men and upperclassmen, appears to be hitting
its mark. The program for women, revised in
part this year, can expect even more than its ac-
customed success. Never, in an undergraduate
generation, at least, has there been such a concert-
ed and whole-hearted attempt to spread Pitt spirit
among the newcomers.
In the light of all this, it is interesting to note
a bit of editorial comment which the University’s
orientation program has evoked in the weekly
paper of a smaller district college:

(K

. . It seems clear that even a four-month pro-
gram such as Pitt’s will not obviate the quite evi-
dent fact that this college enjoys tremendous and
inestimable assets in the very smallness of the stu-
dent body. Those of our freshmen who were slightly
wearied by what they thought was simply a flow of
words must admit that the very size of their class
and the simplicity of our campus organization, es-
pecially as compared to Pitt’s, makes this campus a
much more sociable and friendly place. to get ac-.
quainted on.”

The writer of the editorial plainly believes that
the little school has it all over the big school when
it comes to getting acquainted. There are few
who can doubt his argument. The point is that at
the University the truth of the writer ’s statement
is not so marked as it was last year. All indica-
tions point to the probability that it will be even
less accurate next year and in successive years
to come. The University can well be proud of the
steps it is taking in that direction.

No one can doubt the fact that orientation is
exceedingly difficult for a thousand or more young
men and women from Greensburg and McKees
Rocks and Jeannette and Tarentum who swarm
upon a campus that is entirely new to them and a
life that is totally different from any they have
known. That Dean Lanfear and his associates
have dug into the problem of effecting that orien-
tation, regardless of its magnitude, is in itself a
tribute to those men and to the University which is
being strengthened by their efforts. That Dean
Amos and her assistants are constantly on the alert
to consider changes in their program, one which
has been interesting and effective for many years,
is proof enough of their eagerness to orient fresh-
man women in the best and most attractive
manner.

After viewing all this, it seems almost superﬂu-
ous to suggest to the ﬁrst—year men and women
that they should cooperate in every way possible
with the administering of these two programs.
Planned at the cost of much research and executed
with the cost of considerable time and effort, the
orientation courses are designed for but one pur-
pose, to help the freshmen.

These, then, can be satisﬁed with nothing less
than whole-hearted cooperation in adding unto
themselves the information and ideas presented to
them, learning the prescribed songs and cheers,
thoroughly acquainting themselves with the Uni-
versity, and wearing the felt arm band and the
green button with a. certain proudness in that they
are the ones for whom a new beginning is being
made.

And So To Bed

OVV‘ THAT THE UNIVERSITY social pro-

gram has swung into high gear, it might not

be amiss to suggest a few words of caution
in regard to students missing out on sleep. A hun-
dred and ﬁfty years ago, Benjamin Franklin de-
clared that sleep makes us healthy, wealthy, and
wise. After a century and a half, it is still evi-
dent that Mr. Franklin had something on the ball
when he made that declaration.

Particularly at this time of the year, when.
changing weather brings a certain susceptibility to
colds, there is need for a sufficient amount of sleep.
Every notice about the common cold that has come
out of the University Student Health services is
headlined by the suggestion: “Get at least eight
hours of sleep each night.”

According to science, those people who boast
that they can work almost indeﬁnitely without
sleep are making inaccurate statements. They
simply enjoy periods of semi-consciousness during
the hours when they think they are awake, which
take the place of orthodox slumber.

Observing that many students practically slept
through their early morning classes, the University
of Texas has adopted courses for teaching stu-
dents how to sleep. Classes of more than 200 have
been materially beneﬁted, it is reported.

Experiments in sleep laboratories show that
manual workers might miss sleep for a time witli-
out ill effect, but that business and professional
workers still needed their regulation eight hours of
sleep in order to be healthy, happy, and efficient.

Students are urged to mingle in as many social
functions as possible because of the accepted
values derived. They are also urged to ﬁnd eight
hours a night for sleeping purposes. It might be
wise to look around before lighting the candle at
both ends.

I Pitt Personals

Margaret Doescher, C35, past president of the Women’s
Glee Club, is working for the Old Folks’ Assistance Fund
in the new county building. Peg got a chance to renew
some campus acquaintances at the College Association
dance Friday night.

 

Edward Durkin, C36, president of Interfraternity Coun-
cil, ran into some of the toughest luck imaginable. Ed
burned three of his ﬁngers on a stove. at his fraternity
house and is going around with a bandaged hand. The
set-up is a natural for the obvious crack “Too much hand-
shaking, eh, Ed?” Of course, it had to happen in rushing
season.

 

Charles Foreman, C35, winner of the ODK award and
now Carl Cass’ right-hand man, is also wearing his hand
under wraps as a result of a couple of burned ﬁngers.

Frances McLaughlin, Ed35, last year's Alma Mater,
talked things over Friday afternoon with Don Elser, pop-
ular Notre Dame backﬁeld ace, who came with the Irish
to play Tech.

 

Notre Dame, by the way, this year has something new
in the way of traveling equipment for its team. Each
player has a smart blue jacket, embellished with a Notre
Dame design in gold. This jacket ta.kes the place of
sweaters and coats for the hours the players spend
lounging indoors, for the table, and for walks about the
streets. The uniformity provided by the jacket aroused
favorable comment here.

_Dr. Marion Hathway, assistant director of the divi-
sion of social work, spent the week-eiid in New York
city at an executive committee meeting of the Associa-
tion of Schools of Social Work. Dr. Hathway is execu-
tive secretary of this body.

The well-known combination of George Roll, Ed35, for-
mer cadet-colonel of the ROTC, and Enice Natalie, Ed34,
leader of many da.nces as an undergraduate, made a re-
turn visit to campus social life by turning up at Friday
night’s dance at the Grotto. Roll is on leave from a gun
crew detail at Mt. Gretna.

 

McCready Huston, ‘director of University publicity,
looked over the publicity and news services of North-
western University while on a visit there last week. Mr.
Huston reports that in the past year the news services

 

of the University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania,
Notre Dame University, and Temple University have
been‘ studied by the Pitt division with a view to learn-
ing now the accomplishments of students and faculty
may be best made known to the public.

 

Freshman Robert ‘Rudolph, who comes from South
High School, has quite a reputation among classmates
as an amateur chemist.

Coal Tie-Up Lowers General
B_l1_S_l_l1eSS Level In District

Survey Shows Average
Still Above Similar
Period In 1934

Because of the almost complete
stoppage of coal production, business
activity in the Pittsburgh district
slumped severely last week, accord-
ing to the Bureau of Business Re-
search.

The Bureau’s index of general busi-
iiess in the district dropped from 69.5
in the week ended September 21, to
60.2 for the week ended last Satur-
day. In the week ended August 31,
the index was 70.9, and, in the week
ended September last year, it was
53.6.

An encouraging note is that al-
though the coal industry was almost
at a standstill last week because of
labor troubles, the level of business
in the district was substantially higher
than it was in the corresponding week
last year, when coal production was
relatively active.

An agreement was reached between
operators and miners on Tuesday;
consequently, coal production is (-:.l.’-
pected to increase appreciably in the
next two or three weeks. It should be
noted, however, that stocks of coal
are heavy, and production may be
held back temporarily until they are
materially reduced.

The index fell 9.1 points last week,
the fourth severe slump so far this
year. Each time, moreover, the slump
in the index resulted from the same
cause, stoppage in coal production.
The ﬁrst sharp drop came at the be-
ginning of April, when the index fell
from 72.8 in the week ended March
29 to 61.2 in the ﬁrst week of April;
the second came at the middle of
June, when the index fell from 71.1
in the week ended June 15 to 63.6 in
the week ended June 22; and the
third came at the beginning of July,
when the index went down from 66.9
on June 29 to 57.4 in the week ended
July 6. After each of these slumps,
the index recovered rapidly.

The index of iron and steel produc-
tion declined a little last week, but
operations were expanded enough this
week to offset the drop. Electric power
production also went down a little
last week, largely because of the de-
crease in coal mining operations.
Freight shipments were smaller, of
course, as a result of the decrease in
coal tonnage. On the other hand, the
index of trade advanced slightly, a.nd

the index of bank debits increased 

appreciably.

Three Nationality Bodies Plan
Elaborate Affairs To Raise
Funds For Cathedral

An abundance of social affairs,
sponsored by committees for the na-
tionality rooms in the Cathedral for
the purpose of raising funds to fur-
nish these rooms, will be held during
the month of October.

The committee for the French room
of the Cathedral is sponsoring a raffle,
the lucky number to be awarded an
ocean voyage on the Normandie in
conjunction with “Bal Tarbarin” din-
ner and dance to be held at the

-Longue Vue Country Club, October 25.

Chances are priced at one dollar
apiece, and may be purchased at
Room 1309, Cathedral of Learning.

The affair will be a beneﬁt, the pro-
ceeds to go towards furnishing the
French room. An entirely {French at-
mosphere will prevail. The menu
will be in French, and the dinner
guests will be served by French wait-
ers.

A feature of the evening will be the
parade of French historical charact-
ers. The famous women will be por-
trayed by local debutantes, appropri-
ately and elaborately costumed for the
occasion. The Masquers will imper-
sonate the chivalrous males of the era
of the Louis’ and other famous per-
sonages of even more ancient times.

Following the dinner, which will
be served at 8 o’clock, will be a typic-
al French ﬁoor show featuring an
Apache dance. Mrs. S. Brainard West
will also do a specialty dance titled
“Le Dance des Flames Boles.” Music
for the dance will be supplied by the
Felix orchestra.

A “Feast of the Mouths" will be
held by the Scottish Room Committee
in the Commons Room on the even-
ing of October 17.

The banquet will be all the title
implies. Each table will be decorated
to represent a month of the year, thus
providing a delightful atmosphere for
the festivities.

The committee for the Yugoslav
Raoom will sponsor a- dance at the
Knights of Columbus Hall, Friday, Oc-
tober 18.

The admission price will be 50 cents,
and the proceeds, as in the other func-
tions, will be used by the committee
to equip their nationality room.

Wash-Jeff Falls
Before Improved
Pitt Attack, 35-0

Patrick Gets Three Touchdowns,
Kicks Field Goal; Dougert,
Wood Put On Best Play '

Washington and JeHerson’s Presi-
dents retired from football competition
with the Panthers Saturday at Wash-
ington. The retirement proceedings
were marked by some pleasing per-
formances by Mr. Frank Patrick, Pitt
fullback, and ended on a high note
when Jack Dougert and Johnny Wood
collaborated to produce the ﬁnal touch-
down on the prettiest play of the year.

Five touchdowns, a ﬁeld goal, and a
couple of successful placement kicks
after touchdowns added up to 35 points
for the Panthers. The retiring Presi-
dents failed to score, The battle on the
gridiron was augmented by vigorous
ﬁghting along the borders, causing
state policemen to have a ﬁeld day
with quarrelsome spectators.

W. & J. started out to make its last
stand something of a surprise. After
receiving the opening kickoff, the
Presidents picked up a ﬁrst down by
a ﬁve-yard gain and a Panther oﬁside
penalty. The ﬂurry ended right then
and there as LaRue recovered Etzwel-
ler’s fumble and Pitt was off to the
races.

LaIRue and Patrick had the ball
down near the goal line in jig time
and the stocky fullback smashed it
across for the ﬁrst score. Patrick al-
so added the extra point.

Pitt got hold of the ball again on
the 50-yard line and Randour, Michel-
osen, LaRue, and Patrick all ﬁgured
in the drive which brought a ﬁrst down
on the nine-yard line. Coach Hank
Day sent in his ﬁrst string backﬁeld,
consisting of McBurney at fullback,
-Croft and Merlo at halfbacks, and
‘Hardy at quarterback.

Three plays later Patrick was div-
ing through the air for the second
touchdown. A couple of holes in the
Panther line and a slip-up on hand-
ling the ball ruined Pitt’s attempt for
the extra point.

Reserves Continue Parade

Dr. Sutherland sent in a new back-
ﬁeld to start the second quarter. The
combination of Rector at fullback and
Shedlosky and Stapulis at halfbacks,
picked up where the regulars left
off when Shedlosky intercepted a W.
& J. pass and scooted 25 yards to the
Presidents’ 41. The trio of ball car-
riers niarched along to Pitt’s third
touchdown, with Rector going over
for the score. Frank Souchak, who
spilled more President plays than a
nervous waitress can spill glasses of
water, accounted for the extra point.

Near the end of the ﬁrst half the
Pitt attack bogged down conveniently
on the ten-yard line to allow Patrick
to boot ,a perfect placement goal from
the ﬁeld.

Pitt picked up another Prexy fum-
ble early in the third quarter. This
one gave the Pitt offense a chance to
get moving from around the W. & J.
30. LaRue and Patrick took charge of
things once more and the fullback
again leaped over the line to score.
He missed the extra point attempt.

After that the game assumed very
tame proportions until the ﬁnal spark,
engineered by Dougert and Wood,
made several hundred fans resolve
never to leave a game early again.
Dougert picked S.zewezsyk’s pass right
off his shoe-tops and raced for the W.
& J. goal. A couple of enemy tack-
lers loomed in his path and, as they
closed in, Dougert wafted the ball to
his left, where Johnny V»/'ood took it.
in full stride. Dougert then picked
oﬁ the two prospective tacklers and
Johnnyiloped across the line to his
ﬁrst collegiate touchdown.

Pitt looked twice as good, both of-
fensively and defensively, as it did
against Waynesburg last week. Pat-
rick’s play appeared to hold the list,
although LaRue, Shedlosky, Souchak,
and quarterback Michelosen did some
high class work. McBurney was a
great part of the show for the losers,
although Captain Paulekas and Slen-
ski were very much in the way of
Pitt plays.—-C. R.

University Tennis Champion
Watches Tilden ‘Cannonball’

Madden Mixes Strokes
With Pro In Recent
Trip To Gotham

By Thomas Locke

Bob Madden, University tennis star,
not only had a taste of top ﬂight ama-
teur competition, but also had the
privilege of playing several matches
with the greatest of all tennis players,
Bill Tilden, in his recent trip to the
national championships at Forest
Hills.

Madden No. 1 man of the Pitt var-
sity, and Dr. O’Loughlin, Panther
coach, both competed in the champion-
ship. Madden was eliminated in the
ﬁrst round by Gabe Lavine of Phila-
delphia, who is the ﬁrst ranking play-
er in the middle states. His coach
won his ﬁrst match, defeating Nate
Herndon, New York, but was elimin-
ated in the next round by ‘Henry Cul-
ley of California.

Dr. O’Loughlin, who toured with Til-
den several years ago, introduced Mad-
den to the international star. Madden
played three sets with “Big Bill” on
each of the two days following his
elimination.

The Pittsburgh star was justly proud
of the fact that he was able to win
four games in one of the sets with the
man who has limited many famous
opponents to less. Bob claims he was
more exhausted after playing four
games with Tilden than he would have
been after a set with any other play-
er whom he has met.

Tilden told Dr. O’Loughlin that he
was well impressed with Bob's play,
especially his speed. He advised Bob
to get into the Eastern Grass Court
circuit next summer. This circuit in-
cludes tournaments at Southampton,
Newport, Rye, Seabright, and Spring
Lake and ends with the National Dou-
bles and National singles tournaments
at Forest Hills.

Bob said, “Playing Tilden was good
stuff. For the ﬁrst time in my life I
enjoyed being trounced.”

At the present time Bob is in White
Sulphur Springs, VVest Virginia, where
he is participating in the seventh an-
nual Middle Atlantic intercollegiate
tournament and the Greenbrier invita-
tion tourney.

Madden’s many titles include: ninth
ranking junior in the United States,
No. 1 ranking junior in the Middle
Atlantic States, and fourth ranking
player in the Pittsburgh district. Al-

 

though placed fourth in the district-

this past season, he has defeated each
of the three players ranked above him,
Frank Broida, Dr. John O’Loughlin,
and Dr. Dave O’Loughlin, at least once
in tournament play.

Yearling Runners
Trounce Jayvees

Woodruif Leads Ivlates To Win
In First Cross-Country Event ‘

Johnny Woodruff, national Inter-
scholastic mile record-holder, led his
freshman mates to victory over an ex-
perienced junior-varsity Friday, by a
score of 18-37. The lanky Negro ace
breasted the tape in 15 minutes, 29
seconds, some 200 Yards in fI‘0I1t 5'5
the runner-up Filson, a frosh team-
mate.

This was the ﬁrst cross-country
meet for 11 successful yearlings.

Attempting to shake their slower
starting opponents, Walmsley, McCon-
nell, and Pfaff, all jayvee men, took
Flagstaff hill in full stride. At the
foot of the hill adjacent to the golf
course, Cogswell passed the early
leaders to take the lead for the frosh.

Meanwhile Woodruff, running a
heady race in fourth position, moved
up and at the half-mile mark stepped
out in front of the others, never to be
headed.

The golf-course hill was more than
the Junior-varsity men could take.
Filson, Nordstrom, Baronati, Treden-
nick, and Zamborsky, all of the fresh-
men, swept by the faltering upper-
classmen. Nordstrom in third plaace,
was the ﬁrst Jayvee to place.

The ﬁnishers in order were: VVood-
ruff, F, 15:29; Filson, F, 15:51; Nord-
strom, JV; Baronati, F; Tredennick,

F; Zamborsky, F; Cogswell, F;
Walmsley, JV; Cummings, JV; and
Montroll, JV.

Those following the ﬁrst 10, re

spectively, include: Northrop, JV;
Cilletti, F; McConnell, JV; Follett, F;
Bright, F; Pfaff, JV; and Edmunds,
JV.
Varsity Works Out

Coach Olson’s varsity hill-and-dalers
practice daily over either the four or
six-mile route. On October 12, the en-
tire varsity squad will run against
Bethany on the S-chenley park course.
The ﬁrst six Pitt ﬁnishers will not
count in the point score according to
Olson. While this contest offers the
“varsity” time-trial competition, the
juniors will have actual meet compe-
tition.

The Penn State cubs come to the
University October 26 for a race with
the little Panther hilltoppers.

Ferguson Again Makes
Headlines With Feline
Pet; “It Crawls”

 

Dr. John M. Ferguson, assistant pro-
fessor of economics, is a man much
respected by those many students
who have taken his courses. None
would be so bold as to call Dr, Fergu-
son a seeker of the spotlight, a pur-
suer of publicity. But a recent action
of the good doctor’s looks . . (libel
deleted) . suspicious.

Not too long past, Dr. Ferguson’s
famous feline mongrel, “Ism” was re-
ported lost, stolen, or most probably
strayed. Now the professor hits the
headlines by virtue of adopting a. suc-
cessor to that precocious little rascal.

Regina McCabe, C37, sister of Dr.
George K. McCabe, former assistant
professor of economics here who is
now active head of the economics de-
partment at Catholic University in
Washington, D. C., donated the speci-
men to Dr. Ferguson.

The new edition to the economics
department is nice enough to have
around, says Helen Snyder, Ed37, Dr.
Ferguson’s secretary. “but I wish it
wouldn’t crawl all over my feet when
I'm trying to type.”

Italy Not So War-Minded,
Say Prfen Who Were There

 

Instructors Crow, Gerber Of English Department Return
Convinced Country Is Artiﬁcially Stirred Up

By Jean Barnes

“England, does not want war,” said
Miss Theresa Kahn, instructor in Eng-
lish.

“Neither does Italy,” declare John
Gerber and Charles Crow, instructors
in the same department.

Mr. Gerber and Mr. Crow included
Italy in their travels this summer
through Europe. They said of the
Italians’ attitude towards the Ethiop-
ian crisis, ”The Italians seem apathe-
tic. One Italian soldier to us, “If
Mussolini wants Abyssiiiia, we want
it.’ Which is a very cryptic state-
ment, and could be interpreted al-
most any way.

“But on the whole, the people do
not seem to want war. The land-
scape seems as peaceful as it has al-
ways looked; the people are rather
indifferent. Really, the whole trouble
seems to be one of propaganda, aiit1-
English propaganda. ‘While we were
there, a booklet was circulated, called,
rather sarcastically, ‘Our Friend, the
English.’ The picture on the cover
was one of John Bull playing golf
with a skull.

“The papers are coloring the facts
at great deal. Rickett, who attempted
to put over the Standard Oil deal,
was represented as an English work-
er. The fact that he was working for
an American company was sup-
pressed.”

Mr. Gerber went on to tell of an
interesting incident that happened to
him while he was traveling to Na-
ples. Mr. Crow had stayed behind in
Rome.

“There were several Italians, in the
train compartment, including a sailor,
a woman who had just bade her hus-
l.-and good-bye as he set off for war,
and one who spoke English. One man
was reading a newspaper. Suddenly
he jumped up, scarlet, crumpling the
newspaper in his hand.

“If I had an Englishman in this
compartment, I would choke him to
death,” he cried. There was a large
anti-English story in the paper.

“The sailor laughed.

“‘You have an Englishman in the
compartment,’ he said, pointing to

me. He had heard me speaking.

“The Italian who could speak Eng-
lish cut in quickly, explaining to the
irate passenger that I was American,
not English; and my neck is still all
right. Fortunately, they do not hate
Americans.

“We saw several parades while in
Germany and Italy. Compared to Ger-
many the Italian troops look ill-trained,
almost sloppy, and very young. The
boys seem about 19 years old. The
trains are packed with them on their
way to the sea and warships.”

They also saw a Nazi demonstra-
tion in Germany, in Cologne. About
8,000 men marched in the night ex-
hibition, all bearing torches.

“I never saw such precision,” said
Mr. Gerber. “And even the boys and
girls have it. It is a common sight to
see a crowd of young people sudden-
ly swing down a busy boulevard, all
singing their rousing Nazi marching
song. They enjoy it hugely. It seems
to me that they are getting back na-
tional and personal pride through
their demonstration and marching.

“The persecutions in Germany are
not so marked as it would seem. To
a casual traveler, everything looks
rosy and prosperous. The German peo-
ple naturally do not open up to all
tourists, as they would if one had
relatives in the country.”

Mr. Gerber and Mr. Crow spent ﬁve
weeks in England, also, particularly
in the southern and cathedral towns.

They also Went to Oxford and to
Cambridge. At Oxford they spent
some time with an Australian grad-
uate student, who seemed shocked at
the amount of work done at Pitt.
’.=‘here the students work only three
or four hours a day. He was also
amazed at the description of the Ca-
thedral of Learning.

“Forty stories high,” he would re-
peat, “forty stories high.”

The travelers noticed one other
thing. Travel is expensive, every-
where but England—and particularly
in France.

It's Just An Old

Freshman Custom

Custom examinations are over
and freshman women are display.
ing the familiar blue and gold felt
armbands. The examination was
rather easy and most of the girls
that took the test past it with fly-
ing colors.

To those young ladies who con.
ducted the exams a few very re-
markable answers regarding the
purpose of the customs regulations
were submitted: to acquaint fresh.
man women with upperclass men
by wearing the green armband so
that if you are in trouble he will
help you. (Nice opportunity
there, gentlemen).

Here is another one—“To make
freshman women acquainted with
various parts of the campus which
part they would not know if they
did not use back doors." (What
part if the campus is that?) And
still another one-—“To encourage
industry.”

Then there is the little fresh-
man who asked her Mentor in all
seriousness, “Is it true that every
girl who comes to Pitt gets an en-
gagement ring with her diploma?”
They pay enough for the sheep-
skins, anyway.

More cigarettes are smoked today because

more people know about them—— they are better advertised.
But the main reason for the increase is that they are made

better-—made of better tobaccos; then again the tobaccos are

blended—a blend of Domestic and Turkish tobaccos. A
