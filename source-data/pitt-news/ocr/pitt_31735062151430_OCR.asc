MAKING PHYSICAL EDUCATION
o   A'TTRAC"I‘IVE - '

_ An announcement appears in this week’s issue of the PITT
‘ WEEKLY of the reorganization of the Inter-fraterniay Basket-
ball League and we are -glad to see that such action was taken.

 The main idea in maintaining -athletics at the University, and:

T this includes physical education,  to keep the students _in good
physical condition. Varsity athletics are maintained not only

 for physical beneﬁts but also to create'and maintain school
 spirit. V V
men and women, but ‘for the most part, the students consider.

The department of physical education reaches all our

. gym work drudgery. _ . V
"'Inter-department or any form ‘of student activity which

creates enthusiasm ‘and ﬁnds its outlet through competition in_

'gaI'nes’i_s much moreattractive to the students and is better‘ sup-
ported by them. We would like to see more of this sort of thing.
Under the direction of Athletic Director Miller, the Inter.-fra-

7 ternity Basketball League last year was_a decided successand

V  0 VA “we havono doubt that this year’s venture will be just’ as success-"

  V  ful as that of last year. The only objection to inter-fra?rnit»y
  ' athletics is that cit excludes all those who do not belong

o fra-
ternities. However, an -inter-fraternity league reaches a large
number of st_udeents,and for this reason it should be encouraged,

 A Universityfciedits  for   Musiclessons

In certain departments of the University credits are~‘al1o_we_d for private
lessons in musictaken outside the University, and there “is an arrangement

- for an, exchange of credits with the Pittsburgh Musical Institute.” (Quoted
from Summer Term Bulletin, 1917.) The Institute oﬁers private lessons in
piano, voice, violin, organ and ’cello, with a faculty‘
teachers. Situated at the comer of Fifth and Tennyson Avenues, only ﬁve’
minutes’ walk. from ‘the University, a most economical arrangement of
schedules is pos_sible. An inquiry at the Institute oFﬁce, 4259 Fifth Avenue,

or phone ‘Schenley. 1000, will bring full particzulars.

When -the United States entered
the war, he volunteered ‘for the
Ma_ssachusetts_. General Hospital
Corps, whichfwas one of the first
medical units sent. to'France. In a
recent‘ letter he writes: ,"‘Had a
wondrous two weeks,at the front——-'.
sent up on detached duty for observa-
tion and I'll never forget it, you may
be sure. I.t.;only ‘served to tell me
that reading, hearing and seeing pic-
tures can never convey the ‘desolation
and horror of it, all. "It meant a" wholly
new‘.point of view andia new under-
s'tandin§~.().f ‘what it does to a':rnan’s
sou.1,as well is to his"body.”  l
' Since before Christmas, Dr. Wright
has been in Paris.‘atta'ched, on army

orders, to -the American RedjC-ross

for.tempora1‘y‘duty. He is working
with Major Richai-3ﬂ¥Cabot, the dis-

_ 1 Schoplhas for,some-.time~-
felt the’ ad isability of insisting upon

quirement. 
am told, an unwritten arrangement*h'a:_s
been in effect between this school jalid,
yours with the aim in view th'at!-$t_.u-
dents should be advised to include this '
much Latin
paration. - V - . V, 3,

At a recent faculty meeting the.='In.s;t-
ter was brought up for further consid-
eration and it was decided, to 1nsl8t.'uI30n
two years of Latin as a._ 'deﬁn,1te:.‘ pro,-r
medical requirement. This Latirnsfhoulldl
preferably be taken;as a. par.t=‘j.i-Vf the.
high school course, but in case a student
has not included at least two years’. of
Latin in his preparation before hej-'r'egl.s-
ters in"the six-year combinedw.de'gr‘ee
course, we should like.- to recommend
that_ he be required to takefu-p .two_
years of Latin as part of his ‘college
preparation. This action is :ta.'ken,-on
our part after .due consideration . of :-the.
situation-and in conformity with the‘
ideas expressed by the Council on Medi-
cal 'Education of the American Medical

‘Association. ' -_ . _ - I . -
kind as to bears-this

’ Will Ybu be so A
new requirement in mind and to "give

it warrants? _ ' .  .;
