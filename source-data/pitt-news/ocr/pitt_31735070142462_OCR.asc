Former mayoral write—in candidate
discusses ideas with persistence

Lindsay Carroll

Assistant News Editor A

In the Jewish faith, there’s a prayer
about being idealistic. God gives you
your ideas while you’re on the moun-
taintop, and youtakethe idealismback
down into the valley with you.

LesterLudwigtranslatedthat ideal-
ism into3 cents inthe city’slastmayoral
election.

Ludwig, who ran as awrite—in can-
didate, wanted grocery stores like Gi-
ant Eagle to ask customers for 3 cents,
which they could donateto one of three
different programs. 'I‘his, he said, would
fimd an increase in police oﬂicers and
allow many Pittsburgh students to at-
tend college forfree. He advertisedthis
idea on yellow ﬂyers that had pennies

mayoral electionthis pastfall after los-
ingto Bob O’Connorinthe 2005 Demo-
cratic primary and later in the general
election. Ludwig felt he had a chance,
despite what he called a “political ma-

chine” here in Pittsburgh, referring to _

the city’s political system.

City Councilman Bill Peduto, who
represents areas including North Oak-
landinDistrict8, saidthathehasknown
Ludwig for almost 10 years. Ludwig is
one of a group of people who come to
meetings regularly to voice concerns.

“He’s acolorﬁil individual,” Peduto
said of Ludwig.

When he ran for mayor in 2005
againstludwigand MayorLukeRaven—
stahl, Peduto saidLudwigwas especially
harsh on him at a debate one night.

“Througiout the debate, he kept

To the surprise of students and

starting on a Wednesday to satisfy as-

Beeson dismissed the speculation
some students had that the economy
caused Pitt to change its schedule in
order to save money.

“We haven’t changed our calendar
guidelines at all because of the econ-
omy or fun ' g,” she said. “The only
changewe’ve madeinrecentyearswas

request of students.’ ’

Like mostlarge universities, Pitthas
an independent Calendar Committee
that is responsible for developing the
University’s schedule. The committee
includes professors, provosts, faculty
members and, sometimes, students.

“The committee always brings in
students to discuss issues with sched-
ulingifthey aregoingto deviatefrom
the ﬁve-year cycle,” Beesonsaid. “We

always make sure students participate
in the discussion.”

Chelsea Vincent, aphysics and as-
tronomy major, was perturbed by the
calendar’s quirks.

C Vincent lives in Maine and ﬂies
out of Pittsburgh for the holidays. She
normally schedules ﬂights months
inadvance to get the cheapest ticket
prices, butthis semesterVincent’s plans
backﬁred when she realized students

could not move back into their dorms

move into her dorm early, she choseto
reschedule the retum leg of her ﬂight,
which she said cost $150.

“I ﬁgured there must be exchange

Vincent said.

Beeson said commencements at Pitt
are scheduled for the last weekend of

“You’re damned,” Ludwig said.

“What do you have to do?” he asked.

“You have to pick yourselfup,” he answered.

Ludwigproceeded to go into the salvage busi-
ness, where he sold everything from “nuts and
bolts to ﬁlet mignon.” ”

“Of course, I don’t have to tell you, I did quite
well,” he said.

When business began to die down, Ludwig
opened an assisted living business at the sugges-
tion of afriend. Assisted livingended up beingtoo
hard, he said. He went back to salvage and later
retired. Now, hefocuses on politics andparticipat—

Earningsupport '
In2o06, while Ludwigwas runningagainstfor-
mer mayorBob O’Connor as awrite-in candidate
inthe general election, Ludwig earned the support
ofDaveAdams. Thatyear, Adams, who works for
Facilities Management at Pitt, created the Pitts-

burgh Conscience Group. As a black man ﬁom V

Pittsburgh, Adams hoped the group would reach
outtothe black communityto stop the “crime and
culture crime” plaguing it. Adams said thatwhen
he met Ludwig, he thought hewas differentﬁom
the other candidates.

“I kind of liked him because some of his
thoughts were outside of the box, and some of
his thoughts were innovative and progressive,”
Adams said.

Forthe nextthree years, Ludwigworkedwith
51—year—oldAdarns and the Pittsburgh Conscience

Group. Ludwig was the chief investigator for the g

group, whose seven members aimed to be a con-
sulting agency for local law enforcement on crimes
such as drugtraﬂicking. Ludwig’sjobwasto amass
information andto make sure the group wasn’t du-
plicating services provided by any other agency.

. Adams said he didn’tthink Ludwig should have
runinthe current electionlike he did. Ludwig didn’t
pay the $100 ﬁlingfee or collect250 signatures for
his petition, like the other official candidates.

“Les has some great ideas, but I think he’s a A

little old for the stress,” Adams said.
He said he didn’t think write—in candidates
have a chance in Pittsburgh, or anywhere else.

“It’s not about what the write-in candidates
do,” he said. The system is designed to make it as
diﬂicult as possible, and the general community
isn’t educated enough to know they can run that
way. Individuals who want change carft always
move past the political process in place, Adams
said — or the people’s obedience to it.

“It’s almost like the town crier. You’re scream-
ing in the wind, ‘It’s raining, ifs raining,’ and the
people don’t see it,” he said.

Ludwig said he didn’t participate officially be-

cause he didn’t want to be aﬂiliated with parties,

Foreign students
get culture primer

he University of Southern

California is offering a dif-

ferent sort of America 101
class. No, it’s not a history course.
It’s a course that’s designed to help
international students get accli-
mated with the new country and
culture in which they ﬁnd them-
selves..

As if trying to learn a foreign
language isn’t difﬁcult enough,
many international students aren’t
attuned to the range of idioms and
cultural practices Americans ex-
hibit in everyday life. Think about
it, there’s a baseball reference or
saying that describes every facet
of our way of life. But that’s where
“The United States: An American
Culture Series,” steps up to the
plate.

The course is offered for free to
international students, although it
isn’t taken for credit. The course
offers more than just baseball idi-
oms. It also helps students learn
about how to acclimate to the
American diet, according to The
Los Angeles Times.

Foreign students can feel iso-
lated because of language and
cultural gaps, and ‘a class such as
this offers a direct way to aid the
confused international student.
This course takes a novel approach
in that it moves beyond a simple
course designed to improve stu-
dents’ English speaking skills.

Still, it’s difficult to distill a
comprehensive cultural guide
into a single course, especially as

American culture is noted for its
diversity and expansiveness. The
age-old idea that the classroom
doesn’t always translate to the real
world could prove especially true
with a course in cultural ﬂuency.

Perhaps the class’ real beneﬁts
come from its more concrete tips.
In one class, a campus police offi-
cer provided practical safety tips
and instructed new students to
lock up their bicycles and apart-
ments, and told them how to deal
with emergencies. Even though if’s
second nature for those born in
America, foreign students might
not know to dial 9-1-1.

While most larger schools and
universities have an ofﬁce devoted
to international students that has
orientations and resources to help
them adjust, USC has a special
need to aid foreign students -
the school has one of the largest
foreign student bodies per year in
the U.S. Last year more than 7,500
students were international stu-
dents. That’s about one—ﬁfth of the’
school’s enrollment.

Generally, around 1,800 inter-
national students study at Pitt each
year. Yet Pitt might be better off
letting the Office of International
Services’ current resources handle
helping foreign students. Should
a similar class be initiated, there’s
bound to be abundant confusion
between traditional American cus-
toms and sayings and those classi-
ﬁed under the all too esoteric label:
Pittsburghese.

Acclimation tough in reality

Travel Channel Show provides myopic view on cultural adjustment

   
 

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

I’m generally a big fan of the
Travel Channel. It offers an in-

‘ triguing mix of beautiful land-

scapes, outrageous hotels and
the occasional clip of someone
eating an animal testicle. But I
recently caught an episode of the
network’s newest venture called
“Meet the Natives: USA” and was
slightly perturbed.

The show is based off a similar
program that appeared on British
television during 2007. It features
ﬁve men from the South Paciﬁc
island of Tanna who were brought
to the United States for an experi-
ment in what some are calling re-
verse anthropology.

It has often been Western an-
thropologists who explore cul-
tures by living like the people
they study. This attempt at a role
reversal has the ambassadors of

Tanna encounter the broad spec— ,

trum of American culture. In the
ﬁve-part series, the tribesmen

have been introduced to ranch-
ers in Montana, WASPS in New
York, and nuclear families in the
Midwest. _

Along the way, they have some
funny, heartwarming and con-
fusing encounters. The men are

nel.com. ,

It would seem that the observa-
tions the Tanna tribesmen make
during their travels are meant to
illuminate the shortcomings of
American society. By exposing us
to our unquestioned fast—paced

cc

I guess you could call it a classier
version of “Borat.” A

astounded by their ﬁrst glimpse
of snow in Montana and marvel at
the opulence of supermarkets.
Using the observations of
these visitors, the producers of
the show hope to “force us to look
at ourselves through brand-new
eyes,” according to travelchan—

lives, the show hopes to examine
why we put so much emphasis
on ironing our shirts or why we
sometimes value our pets more
than our fellow citizens.

I guess you could call it a class-
ier version of “Borat.”

But despite these admirable

ambitions, “Meet the Natives”
portrays an idealized version of
how these men interact with their
new surroundings. Some viewers
might understand their experi-
ences as typical of newcomers to
the U.S., but such an impression
would be inaccurate.

From the onset, the men are
allowed to question and criticize
the new world in which they’ve ar-
rived. They can ask a farmer why
he needs so many cows and they
can tell a woman that her methods
of cooking are unhealthy, all with-
out repercussion. Their thoughts
probably reﬂect how many people
feel as they enterthis country, but

their ability to scrutinize Ameri-
cans overlooks many realities that
foreigners must face daily.

This distillation belittles what
many immigrants experience
when they arrive in this coun-
try. _

My family came to the U.S.
from India in 1995 and we ob-
served many of the same things
that the Tanna natives did. Our
ﬁrst sight of snow was just as
exciting and our acclimation to
American grocery stores proved
to be just as confusing.

We came here before the In-
ternet gave people from around
the world access to other cul:

tures and languages. Like the
men from “Meet the Natives,”
we sometimes felt like we were
on another planet, surrounded
by people who ‘acted, spoke and

V dressed differently.

My initial exposure to America
and its people was also ﬁlled with
many ugly encounters. Meeting
the natives of this country can be
ﬁlled with hardships that no one
would want to see on television.

For me, being an immigrant
meant that I skipped lunch regu-
larly because the other kids in the

cafeteria made fun of the food I .

brought from home. As for my
parents, it meant that they had. to

reaffirm their place as functioning
members of society by learning a
new language.

While the U.S. did afford us
time to adjust, we had to do so
unquestioningly.. Even when my
family and I were made to feel un-
welcome and totally out of place
in America, we kept quiet because
there was no television audience
backing us up.

The Travel Channel’s show
was likely not intentionally over-
simpliﬁed, but it needs to be ap-
proached with the understanding

that the Tanna tribesman have

the privilege of -so overtly and
freely asking questions and ex-

pressing their own beliefs — a
privilege that most newcomers
do not have.

Still, “Meet the Natives” has
potential. Because this country
has so much wealth and power,
we’re often inclined to see our life-
style as superior. Anything, even
if it’s a TV show, that could bet-
ter attune us to different cultures
and lifestyles and positively affect
us is worth our attention. At any
rate, it’s better than watching the
mindless, superﬁcial programs so
rampant on TV today.

Idol looks to ‘Fightfor Love’ in Pittsburgh

A8'E Editor.

Pittsburgh-loves its idols, and
especially its7gId’ols. a

Elliott  the second run-
ner-up on ﬁfth season of Fox’s

hit singing competition “American
Idol,” is about to come tdthe Steel
City for the ninth time. I _

“I love the city [...]— the fans are

great there,” he said, adding that ‘

Primanti Brothers restaurants stick

out as a particularly fond memory.
Yarninwillperform tonight at the

Altar Bar in the Strip District ($22

' admission at the.do_or). The bar acts

as one of the ﬁrst stops on a month-
long tour, which began last Saturday

    
 

in Alexandria, Va. Though the set 

"list will feature many ‘songs from his

latest album Fight forLove, released
in May, Yamin doesn’t see the tour as
strictly promotional. _

“It’s_been going great so far,” he
said. “It_’§ [going to be] afully acoustic
show with a twis .”

Ironically, one of Yamin’s past
trips tofI>ittsburgh placed him in a
role reyersal, from ‘his origins as a
contestant. In April 2007, Yamin

" hosted the Hillel-jvewish University
Center’as annua1'gAmerican Idol—in-

spired Campus Superstar, in which
local college students compete for
a scholarship. ‘

Yamin’s career began in a season
studded with other artists like win-
ner Taylor Hicks, runner-up Katha-
rine McPhee and third runner-up
Chris Daughtry. The 2006 season
proved surprising in that the major-
ity of the top 12 ﬁnalists, and even
some semi—ﬁnalists, were signed to
major record labels.

After Idol, Yamin released his
se_lf—titled debut in March 2007 un-
der the Song/ATV Music publishing
“label, with the hit single “Wait for

' You” ﬁnding success on multiple

Billboard music charts. Yamin also
released two consecutive holiday-
albums in 2007 and 2008.

Yamin said Idol had a life-chang-
ing impact on his career.

“It was the best experience of
my life so far. Why would I regret
it? I wouldn’t have a career if not for
Idol.”

Yamin said he’s “still very close”
to Hicks. The two toured together
on the American Idols LIVE! Tour
in 2006, and Yamin appeared on
a duet track on Hick’s sophomore
album release.

Being on Idol gave Yamin the op-

portunitytoperforrn andcollablorateil

with a number of legendary music
artists such as Mary]. Blige, but he
notes that Bobby Caldwell and Steve

Russell are two ofhis favorite individ—_ _

ualswith whom he collaborated.

“[Caldwell] is an amazing artist,
and Russell is really great to work
With,” he said.

The recent changes to Idol —the
addition of judge Kara DioGuardi
and the recent replacement of Paula
Abdul with Ellen Degeneres, for
example— haven’t phased Yamin.

“It’s not going to make or break
the show,” he said.

Yamin doesn’t know what he’ll
do when his tour ends. He said a live
EP might be inthe works, but that he
is still trying to’ “ﬁgure everything
ou ”

“I’m, just going to take things as
they come and continue gradually,”
he said.

Yamin gets particularly excited

about his Twitter page, a sentiment .

shared by many artists wishing to
connect with their fan bases.

“I use Twitter for the fans,” he
said. “I just want to give back to them
as much as possible.” ‘

Since arriving in Pittsburgh on
Tuesday evening, Yamin has tweeted
about the beautiful weather saying,
“its snowin its arse o .” He has also
shared his disdain for The Bachelor
and tweeted “That show the bach-
elor, or fake love, as I like 2 call it, is

Best-of lists offer chance to argue,

The results are in. Now let’s talk.

   

Kelsey Shea
Assistant A8rE Editor

As 2009 came to a close, an explo-
sion of activity took place in music
newsrooms across the country,

Fevered debates, ever—changing
lists and crucial decision-making
went down to produce this year’s
music lovers’ bread and butter —
the best-of lists.

The annual frenzy was even
more daunting this year as music
writers and editors had to come to

a consensus on the best albums,

artists andsongs of not only 2009,
but of the entire decade as well.

Ah, and what a great decade
it has been.

The new millennium intro-
duced us to The Strokes, The Ar-
cade Fire and Bright Eyes as well
as many other bands and artists
creeping under the radar and just
waiting to break out in 2010.

The votes are counted and the
results are in. As the readers it’s
now our responsibility to serenely
nod in approval, indignantly point
out who was forgotten and show
outrage at who the lists chose to
include.

Personally, Iwas immensely dis-
appointed to see that The Strokes
didn’t snag any major “Number
One” slots, but I was thrilled to see
multiple magazines acknowledged
The Decemberists.

To sum it up, most major me-
dia Isources agreed that Wilco,
The Strokes, The White Stripes,
The Arcade Fire and Radiohead
presented us with some of the
top albums of the decade and
similarly agreed that Neko Case,
Grizzly Bearand Animal Collec-
tive jammed out some of the best
albums of the year.

Of course, every list is wildly

different even if they do feature
some common favorites. The Avett
Brothers’ newest album was fea-
tured 33rd on Spin’s “Top 40 Al-
bums of the Year” but snagged the
prestigious spot of number nine on
Paste’s “Top Albums of the Entire
Decade.”

Lists are always as different as
the people and publications that
put them out, which consistently
make for some great debates and
discussions. - ‘

Reviewing a year or decade of
music is also a great way to sift
through years of music and pull

"out what’s actually worth our

explore

time. _
Even if you missed some of the

great album debuts of the decade ‘

(which wouldn’t be surprising,
since most of us were still sporting
braces and Aeropostale monkey

«t-shirts for the ﬁrst few years of

the 2000s), all is not lost. _

Now is a great time to give bands
that are always on the edge of your
radar a place on your iPod and to
check out what you missed.

Do you have your own top 10
list or lists? Send them to us and
check back at pittnews.com next

week to see Pitt’s favorites of the .

decade!

Ke$ha unleashes her inner ‘Animal’

: 

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

Ke$ha

Animal

RCA Records

Rocks Like: An Auto-Tune-addicted Katy
Perry who hasn’t showered for a few
days

Grade: B+

Whether or not you will appreciate
Ke$ha’s debut album Animal depends on
your ability to tolerate frighteningly vapid,
party-minded lyrics paired with catchy yet
overly auto-tuned electro—pop. Also, you
will need a strong stomach. The music is
unapologetically filthy.

Try this on for size:

“And now we lookin’ like pimps / in my
gold Trans Am / Got a water bottle full of
whiskey in my handbag / Got my drunk text
on / I’ll regret it in the morning,” she sings
in “Take it Off,” a pulsating club banger
that servesas a high point on the album. V
T Ke$ha certainly doesn’t come across as
the classiest pop princess to hit the scene
recently.

In fact, she makes Katy Perry and her

girl—kissing seem like material fit for an
episode of “Hannah Montana”.

But the fun part is, it doesn’t matter.
Sure, you may feel the need to shower after
listening to only a few tracks, but this is
one guilty pleasure that merits the associ-
ated pop cultural guilt.

It’s refreshing to not only hear a pleasant
new collection of cotton candy pop tracks,
but to hear songs that are so straightfor-
ward in their paper—thin themes of super-
ﬁciality and the rock—star lifestyle.

“Hungover,” “Boots 8: Boys” and “Blah
Blah Blah” are all as ﬂighty and devoid of
intellect as they sound, but —— gasp! —
it’s surprisingly fun to turn your brain off
in short, three—minute increments. from
time to time. 7 ‘ ‘" ' " " 

Of course, when Ke$ha doesl{try)_tAol I; 

serious, it’s hard to suppress giggles”at'the

ridiculousness of her attempts. “Dancing f‘ if. 5
With Tears in My Eyes” and “Stephen? are  . 5 " if

laughably bad missteps —— trust me Ke$ha,
stick to partying. .

“I threw up in the closet / but I don’
care,” Ke$ha sings in “Party at a Rich
Dude’s House”. ‘

I may have just also thrown up a little
bit imagining that, but I suppose I don’t
really care either. i .

THERAPY

cover of his newest release Sex Therapy:
The Experience, accurately depicts his
in—demand status as a talented musical
triple threat. ‘

Though already a Grammy award win-
ner for his songwriting contributions to
Jennifer Hudson’s self— titled R&B album
and Lil’ Wayne’s “Tha Carter III,” Sex
Therapy: The Experience reminds audi-
ences that Robin Thicke is a capable artist
on his own. Each of his three previous
records have spawned hits like “Shooter,”
“Lost Without You,” and “Magic” and have
surprised listeners with their traditional
and .decidedly sensual R&B sensibilities.

Thicke’s fourth effort is just as pleas-
ant as his previous releases in those re-

Aspects.

Among the guests on the new CD are
Jay-Z, Kid Cudi and Jazmine Sullivan.
No matter whether Thicke sings alone
or shares a song with another artist, his
worldliness and romanticism are commu-
nicated through his lyrics and melodies.
These attributes are particularly evident
in uniquely titled tracks like “Meiplé” (Me
I Play) and “Brand New Luv.” ’

In an effort to avoid alienating prospec-
tive audiences, he also invites the rising
star Nicki Minaj to join him on the album’s
most mainstream hip-hop track “Shakin’
It 4 Daddy.”

Thicke has named his fourth CD aptly
because “Sex Therapy” is more than just
a solid album. It is an experience.

Gibbs off to a hot start in Big East play

Sophomore is shooting .409 from beyond the arc and 93. 7 percent from the free throw line

Alex Oltmanns
Staﬁ” Writer

Coming into this season, sopho-
more guard Ashton Gibbs knew
that he would have to improve his
4.3 points per game average if his
team wanted to continue its string
of success.

So far, he’s done just that.

This season, he is averaging
17.5 points per game.

Much of his scoring can be
attributed to his astronomical
3-point shooting percentage of
.409. , '

He also leads the Big East in
free throw shooting at 93.7 per-
cent.

Gibbs spent part of this past
summer in New Zealand with the
gold-medal winning United States
Under-19 team.

This summer and early this
season, helworked hard, taking
hundreds of shots a day, but ac-
cording to head coach Jamie Dix-
on, his improvement in the other
areas of his game has helped the
team the most.

“Everyone talks about how
many shots he puts up, but what
truly stood out to me was how
much his defense has improved,”
Dixon said. “This summer with

the Under-19’s, he really became '

our best perimeter guy.” .

Gibbs hasn’t just improved de-
fensively, but in rebounding as
well. He has 16 rebounds com-
bined in Pitt’s three games against
Big East opponents — DePaul,
Syracuse. and Cincinatti — and
often jumped over much bigger
players to get them.

[Brandin] Knight have really been

Panthers compete in tournament

Three Panthers place in the Midlands Championships

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

After the first day of the Mid-
lands Championships, the No. 21
Pitt wrestling team sat in ninth
place. But when the tournament
concluded the following day, the
Panthers finished 12th.

“The competition the second
day is much stiffer,” Pitt coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “We just
didn’t have the intensity the sec-
ond day that we did the first.”

The Panthers (6-1-1) had five
wrestlers advance to the second
day of the tournament, held Dec.
29-30 in Evanstown, Ill. Three
wrestlers — Anthony Zanetta,
Eric Albright and Ryan Tomei —
placed in the tournament.

“It’s the best [tournament]
we’ve hit this year,” Stottlemeyer
said.

Zanetta went 2-1 on the first
day of the tournament, earning
a 4-0 decision against Ilyass El-
massouri of Rider and a 9-4 deci-
sion over Northern Iowa’s Caleb
Flores. Zanetta lost to Brandon

in that weight class.

The freshman’s record re- Z

versed the second day of the tour-

nament. After beating Michigan
State’s Eric Olanowski with a 4-3

BCS: It’S.
all about
the money

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬂ" Writer

Tonight when you turn on your
television, say around 8 p.m., you’ll
most likely ﬁnd yourself tuned into
the BCS National Championship
game between Texas and Alabama.
Both programs went undefeated
this season, and both deserve to
play in the game.

The only problem is, the Crim-
son Tide and the Longhorns aren’t
the only teams in the country de-
serving of that opportunity. What
I’m trying to say is this: The BCS
system is a bunch of junk and
college football needs to go to a
tournament format for the post-
season.

Fans and sports casters alike
make the argument every year.
There is rarely a deﬁnitive year-
end No. 1 team in college football,
because typically there are more
than two teams worthy of playing
in the championship game. This
year the third team turns out to
be Boise State, which dropped for-
merly undefeated TCU in the Fiesta
Bowl Monday.

But here is why the BCS is in-

. nately wrong when it comes to col-

legiate sports: It’s about proﬁts and
exploiting student athletes. It is a
system driven purely by capital ——
it is far more about making money
than competitive legitimacy and
the growth of young adults. If the
players were professional athletes,
it might be acceptable, but they
are students.

The winners of the six major
conferences — the Big East, Big
Ten, Big Twelve, SEC, Pac-10 and
ACC — get automatic bids to a BCS
bowl game. The top_ two ranked
teams nationally at season’s end
go to the championship game. In
order to be ranked No. 1 or No.
2, teams have to start the season

Dixon: Gibbs’

practice and

work ethic ‘stands out’

Gibbs 4 11

on him about rebounding, and he’s really

. improved in that area,” Dixon said.

Gibbs broke Pitt’srecord for consecutive
free throws made in a season (34) against
Syracuse, exemplifying his hard work in_
other aspects of the game. Gibbs extend-
ed and set the record at 40 in Pitt’s game
against Cincinnati, but missed onhis 41st
free throw attempt. ..

Gibbs’ work hasn’t gone unnoticed. He
was honored as the Big East player of the
week last week. ’ L if ,

f‘Guys like to work on things they do
well, but working on your weaknesses ,_a‘nd
improving those is what really stands out
to me,” Dixon said. '

Even DePaul coachjerry Wainwright had

high praise for Gibbs following his 24-point

and eight rebound performance in the win _
A against the Blue Demons.

, “It looks like Ashton Gibbs will be the
next really good guard to come out of this
building,” Wainwright said.

“ That’s saying a lot considering that
guards like Brandin Knight, Carl Krauser

A and Levance Fields came before-him;

Gibbs is already well on his way to fol-
lowing in those players’ footsteps, but,
considering he’s a sophomore,’ his poten-
tial couldlbe even greater than that of his
predecessors. ’ 4

' But for now, Gibbs’ energy is focused
on helping his team get back to the NCAA
Tournament. -

Bowl system deeply ﬂawed

Burgos <_ 11 1’

ranked fairly high and preseason rankings
are voted on by coaches from around the
country to begin the year. Typically, pow-
erhouse teams from mid—major conferenc-
es like Boise State do not begin the season
ranked within the top-10. This year the Bron-

" cos started the season at No. 14.’

Though Boise State ﬁnished the regular
season 13-0, with an impressive win against
Oregon and a ﬂawless conference record,
the team ﬁnished just sixth nationally head-
ing into their bowl game. Despite a strong
schedule that included six road games, the
Broncos started the year in too big of a hole
to ever ascend to No. 1 or 2.

So, how does this happen? Well, it’s obvi-
ous. When coaches vote on preseason rank-
ings, coaches from major conference tend
to favor bigger schools based on reputation,

ignoring factors like strength of schedule A

(see: Texas). The higher the major teams are
ranked from the outset, the better probabil-
ity they will be standing one or two at year’s
end. So, what’s the incentive? Well, when a
team reaches a BCS bowl game, $17.5 million
is given to each conference represented. The
more major teams in BCS games, the more
money that is paid to each program. The rich
get richer. Somebody call in Robin Hood,
because this is highway robbery.

Not to mention that college football
coaches don’t get paid to know the best.25
teams in the country. They get paid to know
their schedules and win games. No coach can
submit a fully valid list of programs in the
top—25 because it’s too subjective and they
simply don’t know. A

The obvious remedy is to transition to
a tournament format. I think the top eight
teams at the end of the season should hold
a single elimination tourney to declare a
victor —— call it January Madness. Give ev-
ery conference represented, say, $5 million

just for qualifying, then use the rest of the

money (a total of $87.5 million is given now)
to pay teams and conferences for each round
they advanced. We still won’t have ﬁxed the
problem of the money—saturated culture of

collegiate sports, but at least we will have V

instituted fair competition.

That way, we can see who really is the best
—— Texas, Bama or Boise State. We wouldn’t
have to speculate, we wouldn’t have to gripe
and people would still get paid.

Will it happen any time soon? Probably
not. Is it the right thing to do? I think so.

Panthers face
tough competition

Wrestling 4 11

 

Diana Connor I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
According to coach Stottlemyer, “It’s the best [tournament] we’ve hit this year.”

Lara from Oregon State. Zanetta ﬁnished
eighth in his bracket.

“He had a great ﬁrst day,” Stottelmyer
said. “He’s young and still learning. This
tournament will help him get better.”

Senior Eric Albright advanced to the
semiﬁnals of the 149—pound weight class

after earning an 8-0 major decision against '

Central Michigan’s Justin McDermitt, a
4-3 decision over Greg Lewis of Clarion
and a 9-6 decision over Bucknell’s Kevin
LeValley.

Albright was pinned in his first match
of the second day by Iowa’s Brent Met-
calf, the top seed and eventual winner of
the bracket. After losing to Iowa State’s
Mitch Mueller, Albright won his last match
thanks to a medical forfeit by Central
Michigan’s Anthony D’Ali_e to place Al-
bright ﬁfth.

Heavyweight Ryan Tomei pinned his
first two opponents of the tournament,
Dustin Bles of Triton in 4:49 and Iowa
State’s Eric Thompson in 5:56, before
falling to No. 4 Dom Bradley of Missouri
5-3. .
On his second day of competition,
Tomei beat Ed Bordas of Rider 3-1, but
then lost to No. 1 Aaron Anspach of the
Nittany Lion Wrestling Club via pinfall.
He finished out his tournament earning

a 3-0 decision over Rutgers’ DJ Russo to

place Tomei seventh.
“The heavyweight division was just

stacked,” Stottlemyer said. “It was good
for him in terms of just seeing the com-
petition.”

Sophomores Tyler Nauman and Matt
Wilps also wrestled on the second day of
the Midlands. Both wrestlers lost in their
first matches of the consolation rounds to
end their tournament.

Iowa, the No.» 1—ranked team in the
country, won the tournament with a total
of 168.5 points, in their third consecutive
Midlands title. No. 2 Iowa State ﬁnished
second with 144.5, and No. 4 Central Mich-
igan came in third with 118.0. Six teams
ranked in the top—10 in the most recent
InterMat and wrestlingreport.com rank-
ings sent competitors to the Midlands.

“There are a lot of top programs in that
tournament, and that’s why we go there,”
Stottlemyer said. “We’re trying to be a top
program.” V

After hosting a meet this weekend
against Waynesburg, Columbia and East-
ern Michigan, the Panthers open up the
Eastern Wrestling League action next week
when Lock Haven comes to the Fitzgerald
Field House Jan. 15. Stottlemyer thinks
having his team compete against some of
the best wrestlers in the country will help
improve the Panthers as they continue to
compete.

“Having that experience, you’re better
prepared,” Stottlemyer said. “The biggest
part of our schedule is ahead of us.”

 Fee is for one class for the entire semester.
