Police declare Sunday a success  

Keith Gillogly
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

Despite adisappointing Pittsburgh
Steelers loss to the Green Bay Pack-
ers, Pitt’s Chief of Police Tim Dela-
ney declared the night of Super Bowl
Sunday a success. -
Compared to the" celebratory
havoc that proliferated around
Pittsburgh and Pitt’s campus after
the Steelers’ 2009 SuperBowl vic-
tory, fans were much quieter and less

frenzied this year ——- likely because .

of the loss. Delaney said the area on
Bigelow Boulevard proved ample for
student celebrators. During and fol-
lowing the game, students gathered
there around a big screen that tele-
vised live updates and scores while a
DJ played various dance tunes.
“The screen was a success on
Bigelow,” Delaney said. ‘.‘It took

the crowd away from the business .

district.”

The crowd of 250,students that"

gathered on Bigelow Boulevard alter

the Super Bowl presented minimal
problems to police, Delaney said.
After ofﬁcers noticed some people
setting off ﬁrecrackers within the
celebratory area, they asked the D] to
make an announcement to cease the
ﬁrecrackers. Everyone adhered.
Delaney said that Pitt didn’t re-

ceive any damage to its property.

One couch ﬁre occurred on Mey-
ranAvenue, but the ﬁre department
quickly extinguished it. By contrast,
2009’s Super Bowl celebrations saw

40 ﬁres reported within a 45-minute.

period in Oakland. 4 A

The University and police’s plan
to keep celebrators contained to
Bigelow Boulevard meant minimal
clean up was centered in one area,
said Rob Kaczorowski, director of
Pittsburgh’s Public Works depart-
ment. '

The South Side — which hosted
thousands of fans watching the game
in its multitude of bars —- saw no
property damage and just one ar-
rest, according to Kaczorowski and
police. Clean up was not much dif-

Whether looking for anew place to

_ live or visiting afriend, Pitt students

taking their ﬁrst walk through off-
campus Oakland neighborhoods
will notice some sharp contrasts in
appearance. '
Around Oakland, many area
that house businesses, restaurants
and apartments are clean and well-
maintained. On other streets, it’s
common to ﬁndshattered glass lit-
tered between cracks inthe sidewalk,

and the buildings lining those streets _

aren’t always in the best shape. -
Wayne Bossinger, ﬁeld opera-
tions manager with the Bureau of
Building Inspection, said that resi-
dents had submitted more than 200
complaints about building code vio-

lations in 2010, many of which re- ‘

sulted in citations. The BB1 inspects
homes for city zoning law issues like
maintained ﬁre escapes and ﬁre exits
and construction code violations.
“Oakland is perfect for us college
folk,” senior Nick Brink said. “It has
more pizza places than anyone could
possibly enjoy and a park nearby to
‘run off all the pizza. If all else fails,
there is always a hospital just up the

A street.” *

The diverse urban atmosphere
that excites students like Brink also

excited City Councilman Daniel

Lavelle, whose district includes parts
of South and West Oakland.
“Oakland is not just an extension
of Pitt or any other school’s cam-
pus, it is a home to many long—terrn

residents and young professionals as well as
a region of strong business development,”
Lavelle said.

This diversity sometimes results insur-
prising sights. -

Sophomore Kelly Lakis shared an example
of odd behavior in South Oakland seen from
her porch on Ward Street.

“Honestly, I swear several times a week,
there is this one kid who walks up and down
the street playing his banjo and singing show
tunes. Sometimes he is barefoot. Sometimes
not. You never know. That’s what makes it
exciting,” Lakis said.

Local landowners ﬁnd positives in the di-

verse area as well.

Nick Kefalos, of the real estate company‘

Kefalos & Associates, owns units in both North
and South Oakland. To him, Oakland provides
an ideal area for landlords and tenants alike,

“We refer to Oakland as the golden coast
of real estate. It has so much to offer  the
various universities, hospitals and people. We
love all of our buildings in Oakland,” Kefalos

_ said.

Whereas the eclectic nature of Oakland
draws much appreciation, there are other fac-
tors that evoke less positive remarks. Some
20,000 people live in the 1.5 square mile area

of Oakland’s four neighborhoods — more than ,

4 four people for every square foot '— according

to the most recent‘censusdata._ V »

-.  “The overcrowdingcauses discomfortiat 

times in‘ Oakland.‘ There is constantly a heavy

ﬂowoftraﬂicand entirely edspace,”Lavelle '

said.
Kefalos agreed.
“My units on Bates, Meyran and Sernple
cause me more problems than those in North

_ Oakland, but the problems are few. We usually

credit this to the general overpopulation‘ in
that area," Kefalos said. “[South Oakland is]
far more dense, more exciting. Little issues
are bound to arise.” ' ‘ ' “

Lavelle said.

4 Crime statistics reported by the city seem
to verify Lavelle’s claim. Last year violent crime
fell city—wide by 8 percent, and all reported

Steelers game not a total loss

Super Bowl 4 1

Ohad Cadji I Assistant Visual Editor

Fans in Gene’s Place react on Sunday to thesteelers’ Super Bowl loss. Despite the fans’

disappointment, some business owners said they felt relieved after the loss.

ferent than a regular busy weekend, Kaczo-
rowski said.

Given the 2009 Super Bowl’s aftermath,
the city was braced for a much messier
scenario.s

“Every time you experience something like
that —— be it a Super Bowl or a snow storm —

you learn from it,” Kaczorowski said. “So the V

city was prepared for the worst.”

The throngs ofblack—and-yellow—clad fans
who watched the game in Oakland’s bars were
feeling pretty blue by the end. Shane Drennen,
a cook and bartender at Peter’s Pub, described
the fans’ reactions as “very, very, very dis—
traught.” Drennen noted several girls in tears
and one man hanging his head sullenly. The
bar, however, stayed full alter the loss.

‘ “Surprisingly a lot of peopleystayed. It gave A

them an excuse to just keep drinking,” Dren-
nen said. - ‘

-Drennen —— a Philadelphia Eagles fan ——
felt little remorse, and he was relieved he didn’t
have to face the chaos that could have resulted
from a Steelers win. '

Others in Oakland reported similar feel-
ings of relief. ‘

Nathan Patterson, a bartender at Spice
Cafe, usually parks his car on the street while
heading to work, but opted for the garage on

‘ Sunday in case the situation became crazy

after the game. He too witnessed customers’
depressed mood whenthe game ended, but
about 15 minutes later their spirits lifted with
the help of a_ little music. i

“Overall it was a really good night. Bad
game. Good night,” Patterson said.

Fans at Bootleggers seemed quite angered
by the Super Bowl’s outcome, but also calmed
down after a few minutes, said Ryan Skinner,
a bartender at Bootleggers. But disappointed
fans found a common remedy: “Nobody was

drinking light,” Skinner said.

Skinner said the bar’s location on Semple
Street near Bates made the possibility of up-

’ roarious celebrations less of a concern.

“We’re‘lucky enough tobe off the beaten
path where we don’t have to worry about that,”

,he said. -2

the year. South Oakland residents
reported only nine violent crimes.
Violent crimes include homicide,
rape and aggravated assault.
Despite the overpopulation,
landlords in the area take some sort

of pride in providing a quality place-

for the young people of Oakland to
live.

Harold Perlick, an owner of nine
different Oakland properties, cites.

the garbage and overabundance of l

cigarette butts that litter the streets
of Oakland as some potential areas
of improvement. Lavelleagreed that
the students have a responsibility to
take care of Oakland.

While the majority of 0aldand’s
residents are between 15 and 24,
about 40 percent of the area’s resi-
dents are older that the typical col-
lege age. Also, about 2,QOO of the
residents own their own homes
rather than rent. .

Other organizations, like the
Oakland Planning and Development
Corp., currently have plans that fo-
cus on rehabilitating vacant areas
and abandoned buildings through-
out Oakland. More than 800 homes
— almost 10 percent of Oakland res-

Garbage an issue in spots 2

» idences — were vacant in the most

recent census information.

Wanda Wilson, the director of
OPDC, said that achievinga “peace—
ﬁll and cooperative” coexistence
between all Oakland residences
remains a preeminent topic of

‘ discussion among members of the

corporation.

5 “I would likehto see students more
involved in the planning process. I
would like to get a discussion group
with the neighborhood together to
discuss behavioral problems, and
what the actual residents of the area
would like to see developed,” Wilson
said.

The Pittsburgh City Council,
landlords in the area and organi-
zations such as OPDC all work to
improve the living conditions in
Oakland. , l

“I didn’t fall in love with Pitt
until I moved to South Oakland,”
junior Brooke Wieczorek said. “It
has pockets of different ethnicities,
creeky, cramped and cozy housing
and around the clock energy that is
even more apparent when it disap-
pears in the summer time. I wish I
moved heresooner.”

EDITORIAL

The power of

his might come as a sur-
prise, but writers are hu-
man beings with feelings
—— not just mildly stalker-ish
individuals that creep around

looking into windows .of frater- '

nity houses.

We are more than ourjealous-
ex-girlfriend-like behavior. Most
of us develop a thick skin against
criticism, but some online com-
ments hit below our construction-
paper Batman belts. You know
the types‘of character—defiling
comments we are talking about
— the ones that have nothing
to do with the writing itself, but
instead verbally attack the indi-
vidual with extreme malicious-
ness that would almost never take
place in a face—to-face setting.

What is it about the Internet
and the online-commenting at-
mosphere that channels our inner
Regina George and unleashes her
unadulterated wrath a thousand
times over? '

In a CNN Opinions piece,
sports writer Jeff Pearlman

tracked down some of his “online I

haters,” only to ﬁnd that speak-
ing to them over the phone was
a much more civil — and almost
pleasant —— experience than read-

‘ ing their comments online.

According to Pearlman, “Read-
ers can easily lash out. The ﬁlter
that was a pen and paper has van-
ished, replaced by the immediate
gratiﬁcation of ‘negativity. The
concern for a writer’s feelings?
Ha. What feelings?”

The gratiﬁcation he is talk-
ing about often comes from the
power of anonymity that com-

anonymous comments

menting—enabled»websites give
online readers. And no, it is not
limited to the lack of accountabil-
ity for all you say anonymously,
although that plays a part. In-
stead, the words of an anonymous
person are magniﬁed and given
power because “when someone
makes themselves anonymous
online, other people assume’ they
are like them and are really per-
suaded by them,” Caite Lamber-

ton, assistant professor of busi- -

ness administration and social
media researcher, reported.
- In addition, the social norms

that guide our behavior ofﬂine
are not as strong as when we take _

on an anonymous persona on the
Internet — allowing people to
sayand do things they wouldn’t
normally, in an oﬁ‘line setting.

In a way this serves as an out-
let, but of course the consequence
of such an outlet rears its ma-
niacal head in the form of online
bullying and other types of online
harassment.

Can’t we ﬁnd a better outlet?

Our hope with this piece
would be to bring back some sort
of shred of online civility — to
remind Pitt students that weare
all human beings, and that we

should apply some of the con-

straints of everyday social norms
to our online presences. We want
to keep the opinions ﬂowing, but
"with the thought and intelligence
that normally accompanies a Let-
ter to the Editor. Above all, don’t
respond to pieces online with a
comment about how we are obvi-
ously all inbred, but with why you
disagree with us instead. I

Obama’s got eyes for  

Columnist

 

President Barack Obama has his
eye on the South. Like Darth Vader
to Luke Skywalker, soishall he at-
tempt to lure North Carolina away
from its life in the Republican-
reigned Bible Belt to the. Demo-
crat-dominated “.dark side” —— the
mid-Atlantic!

b Last Tuesday, Obama" an-
nounced Charlotte, N.C., as the

host city for the 2012 Democratic V

National Convention. This deci-
sion sends a clear message that

S Obama-will attempt to hold those

traditionally Southern states that
voted Democrat in the last- elec-
tion —- including North Carolina
and Virginia— in the upcoming
2012 race. ’ ’

neapolis and Cleveland ‘— which

Molly Green.

the South  

are all Midwestern states with tra-
ditional political battlegrounds.

But the decision to host the’

convention in Charlotte might
indicate a change in political ge-
ography. Though Obama carried
North Carolina against Sen. John
McCain by a very small margin ——

‘ 50 percent t0 49 percent — 2007

was the ﬁrst time the state went
blue since 1978.

And it seems the support for’

Obama was not a one-time ﬂuke.
According to Public Policy Poll-
ing, the president had a49-percent
approval rating as of Jan. 25, and
when polled against Republican
2012 hopefuls, he came out vic-
torious against every prospective
candidate. .

Many believe that this is reflec-
tive of an evolving North Carolin-
ian population. According to The
New York Times, Obama’s advisers

“believe the advantages of North 7

Carolina include a population that

is 22 percent black, an inﬂux of new
residents because of research and
banking jobs and laws that allow
last-minute voter registration.”
Indeed, North Carolina ——
‘Charlotte in particular —— seems
to be a state caught between two '
worlds. On one hand, it boasts the

second—largest banking center in ‘

_ the United States after New York

City -—— headquarters to Bank of
America (and former headquarters
of the-now—defunct Wachovia) -
and an up—and—coming technologi-
cal center populated by Northern
imports from Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and New York. Yet on the
other hand, the state has a rich‘
Southern history e not to men-
tion it’s the NASCAR capital of the
United States. .

Still, I ﬁnd South Carolina and
its limitless supply. of NRA rallies
and-its coterie of over-tanned,
over-zealous ‘politicians ‘ consid-
erablygmore frightening.

Exhibit explores lov,e’s omnipresence

Pitt student Jordan StreussmIg’s “Aga1Inst/ Throughout/ Within ’.’ showcases photographs of various heart shapes ’

Sierra Starks
I Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Against/Throughout/Within
Now through Feb. 18

Conney M. Kimbo Art Gallery
William Pitt Union, main
ﬂoor

One Pitt student is on a mission
to prove that love is everywhere,
if only you look.

With iPods, Zunes and other
mP3 players blasting in our ears,
cell phones ﬁrmly attached to our
hands and other matters on our
minds, juniorjordan Streussnig
believes distractions are keeping
students from truly seeing the
world around them. '

Last winter, in the span of a
few days, Streussnig stumbled
upon two different illustrations
of ‘love: an old receipt and a few

fallen leaves,both in the shape’

of a heart. g
’ In reaction to the strange co-

incidence, Streussnig decided
that from that day onward she
would carry her camera with her
when she left the house.

“I just wanted to just see What

I could find,” she said. “It was '

incredible to see what happened
when I began to pay more atten-
tion to my surroundings.”

Walking to class on weekdays,
Streussnig soon noticed apat-
tern: Most of the photos in her
collection were in the shape of
a heart. ‘

“I have a ton of them from all
different kinds of things,” she
said, adding that the artwork

‘ranges from natural to artiﬁcial

ﬁndings e from a patch of snow
to a vacuum cleaner cord. . -

She decided toshare her dis-
covery with those who could
appreciate it most — other Pitt

. students who, like her, were too

distracted to notice such things
on their own.

Streussnig called Alana Miller,
Pitt Program Council’s arts and

ﬁlm director, whose job is to
gather student talent to showcase
in the Kimbo Art Gallery, located
in. the William Pitt Union.

Miller is a ﬁrm believer in al-
lowing others to recognize the
talent and ability of Pitt students“.
Together, she and Streussnig de-
cided that February was the best
time to present Streussnig’s col-
lection of hearts. _

In her artist" statement,

“Streussnig said that she created‘
the exhibit “as a metaphor for.

the ubiquitous nature of what is
probably the most resonating
daily phenomenon — love.”
Streussnig said she hopes that
theiexhibit encourages her peers
to be more present in their daily

routines, to notice the world .

around them.

“Sometimes, the everyday‘

miracles you come across can
inspire you and change yo'ur‘out—
look,” she said.

If there were seven bursts of bluesy
decadence that deﬁned rock post-

‘ 2000, they were the notes that com-

posed the intro to The White Stripes’
“Seven Nau'onArmy.” Everyone knew
them — from marching bands to mu-
sic mavens to kid brothers learningto
play it on their little Stratocasters.
This week, fans” donned their
sackcloth and ashes as the Stripes’
members, Jack and Meg White, an-
nounced that they were parting as
a musical duo last Wednesday. The
amicable split was initiated with the
intent ofpreserving“whatisbea1itiful
and special about the band and have
it stay that way,” according to a news

Wagner:

2011 acrucial year in garage rock

release on the website ofjack White’s
record label. - ‘

Though not entirely unexpected
—— the band had been on hiatus for
several years —— this news comes
among a storm of other develop-
mentsthatsignal2011’s signiﬁcancein
that quintessentially countercultural,
genre, garage rock.

When The Rolling Stones, The
Kinks and The Yardbirds started play-
ing American-styled music with an
edge — getting gaggles of screaming
girls in the process — young Ameri-
can men started imitating them. The

p way the Americans played wasn’t as

polished as their heroes, but they
held a raw edge that inspired a label
of “punk” by the late 1960s.

The genre’s  wave died out by
the early 1970s, but scores of bands

that loved the raw style continued to
‘develop music that rebelled against
this new decade of increasing deca— ’
dence and industrial music produc— '
tion. In many places these groups.
became theﬁrstpunkbands, and the A

legacy of garage rock continued to live

' 0 through its descendent genres.

_ . By the late 1990s, groups yearned
for that style once again, and on both
sides of the Atlantic they set the tone

for the post-Limp Bizkit era with a .

garage—rock revival. ’

The White Stripes was among '

the ﬁrst to bring the raw, tube-driv-
en sound to the modern era, taking
the guitar-drum duo format from
the seminal rockabilly group Flat

Jets Duo and combining it with the _

experimental  of The Stooges,
circa Fun/route.

CD REVIEW

Big fHurry’s ‘Low’ uplifting

Pittsburgh band releases a more mature, upbeat follow—up to its debut

Sara Pecora
Staff Writer

Big Hurry ,

Gets Me Low - _
Rocks Like: Garbage, Yeah Yeah

Grade: A-

i In the somewhat male-dominat-

"ed Pittsburgh music scene, bands
with female members remind us
that women can be involved in
great local music-,,,too. Thank-

fully,VBig Hurr'y’s follow-up EP 1

to its 2009 debut Silver Screen:
does just that. ‘ ’

The band’s new CD, Get: Me . ‘ii

Low, demonstrates a distinct
maturation. while still retaining
many of the initial promising
qualities. Like theprevious al-
bum, an indie-rock feel is omni-

present, with-crunchy guitars and-

slamming drums. This time, how-
ever, Big Hurry’s sound seems
tighter, crisper and more driven,
as opposed to themopier, wan-
dering nature of Silver Screens.
The band’s tone has under-
gone a similar makeover: Where-
as Si/ver Screen: had an anger and
sadness reminiscent of a young

 

teenaged girl, Get: Me Law is
more controlled — it has a simi-
lar wounded feeling, but manages

?to pick itself up and move on.

The title track,'for example, has

N a bouncy rhythm to it — some-

thing 2'/per Screen: lacked. ‘

One of the most welcome ad-
ditions is the voice of drummer
Dani Buncher. Haunting and gor-
geous, her vocals are the perfect

R complement to indie-rock instru-

mentals. On “This In‘Between,”
for example, she and vocalist Kel-
ly Tobias harmonize beautifully,
creating a triumphant melody

‘while drums crashland guitars

reverberate behind them.
The album is short —— just

ﬁve tracks and 17 minutes — but ‘

promises a great listen for lovers
of indie or someone who’s just
getting "out of a bad breakup. '

accomplish with this particular

' display, Miller noted, “I think

that even if you don’t believe [in
the message Streussnig-is trying
to convey], the exhibit can sway
you to believe that anywhere you
look, you can see love.”

To people who know Streuss-
nig, this mentality seems in line
with her personality. Betty Re-

ese, who helped Streussnig orga— .

nize her first exhibit in 2008 in
Greensburg, Pa., said the student

' struck her as “just a really sweet

little girl.” »
Her first exhibit was titled,
“This is How I See It,” and fea-
tured a variety of charcoal draw-
ings and paintings — many of
them abstracted pieces about
personal feelings. ‘ .

As Streussnig was just starting

out, Reese said, “I had to show
her a lot of framing methods.”
However, the then-high school

senior proved to be an industri-‘

ous learner.

V “She really put herself to it in
a big way,” Reese said. “She was
using her imagination, she wasn’t
just copying things.”

Now Miller said Streussnig’s
imaginative qualities are pro‘-
'nounced. .

“I thought it was a very in-
teresting idea, very creative and
clever,” Miller said of Streussnig’s
current collection. “She put a lot

of thought and effort into it, and‘

I think it’ll be something worth-
while for Pitt students to see,”
she said.

As the band departs the industry,
it does indeed leave behind a legacy
of something“beautiﬁ.1l and special.”
Jack White remains one of the most
outspoken advocates of keeping the
record industry viable with his Third
Man Records, inspiring a love for
physical releases that’s admirable in
the age of torrents.

Along with releases from Jack
White’s other projects, The Racon-
teurs and The Dead Weather, more
White Stripes material is available
with a copy of the 2010 live album

L Under Great White Northern Lights,

whichcapturedjack and Meg during
their last tour through Canada. '

The whole album burns like a
match, singeing the listener with
each solo, madcap rhythm and key-
board ballad from “Icky Thump” to
“Jolene.” ' .

The Stripes aren’t the only rockers
making news, though. A

to the Detroit—based Stripes 4- plays
like the Velvet Underground pumped

through a Blondie-saturated ampliﬁer. .

This yearthe band is comingback with

its ﬁrst album together since 2006’s R

Pifstlmpressions ofEarth. The album,
tentatively titled Angels, will release
sometimethis spring. '

Considering how long the band’s
members have been apart and how
many different musical avenues the

‘ members have taken — see my previ-

ous colurnn.on the boys’ side projects

— itwill be interestingto see how they -

come back together. With ﬁve years of
musical development on the other
members’ parts, theycould transcend
their previously patriarchal structure
to show that they makeup the most
diversely creative group in music.

moment for garage rock across the

MEN’S BASKETBALL

 

Pitt passes tough road test at WVU

With Ashton Gibbs out, the Panthers used a balanced scoring attack to defeatthe Mountaineers in Morgantown, W.Va. *

Alex Oltmanns

Sports Editor_

With point guard and leading scorer
Ashton Gibbs sitting out with an
MCL injury for the Panthers’ game
at West Virginia on Monday night,
many questioned who would st :p
up for the Pitt men’s basketball
team.

' _ But for the players and coaches

in the Panthers’ locker room, the
game was just business as usual --
that meant continuing to do what
made them successful to this point,
playing defense and rebounding.

' No. 4 Pitt did just that and
walked away from WVU Coliseum
with a 71-66 win over No. 25 West
Virginia with Gibbs sitting on the
sidelines. '

“We didn’t have to have anybody '

step up, we just had to play the way
we play, do the things that we do,”
Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon said
in a post—game press conference.
“I think we really got that message
across and we rebounded and de-

fended and those are the things that
we can always do.”

The Panthers (22-2, 10-1 Big
East) dominated West Virginia‘

on the boards,_ holding a 40-28

rebounding edge while not allow-

ing the Mountaineers to get many

quality shots. _ _ T
Yet, ‘even with that strong de-

fense,Mountaineerforward‘Deniz9 lib",

Kilicli put on an offensive clinic.

He came into the game aver-
aging 6.9 points per game off the
bench but showed an array of moves
inside along with tough-hook shots
to lead the Mountaineers (1_5—8, 6-5
Big East) in scoring with 19 points,
a career high. '

“We ﬁnally threw him the ball,”
West Virginia head coach Bob Hug-
gins said.,“We should’ve thrown him
the ball at the Villanova game and
we didn’t. That was an emphasis
yesterday, to make sure we throw
him the ball when he’s working to
get it.” -

Even with Kilicli’s impressive
offensive output, Dixon and the
Panthers didn’t panic because they

TONY’S TOP 10

There is plenty to laugh at in college basketball

 
  

Tonyjovenitti
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

  

One of the best things about being a
sportsfanisbeing able to laughatother
teams. ' i

No matter how bad the Pittsburgh
Pirates are, Bucsfanswillalways be able
to laugh at the Chicago Cubs’ “curse.”
And even though the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers lost Super Bowl XLV, theirfans can
still laugh at the Dallas Cowboys’ pa-
thetic season.

Then there are those moments and
games that make you simply laugh out
loud. Yes‘, the phrase “LOL” is overused
nowadays, butitwas act11allyappropri~

ate whenlyou sawthat the Cleveland

 Cavaliers lost 24 straight games.

So for my top 10 this week, I give
you the biggest LOLs of the college
basketball season. _

10. Tennessee. As if their NCAA T

violations weren’t enough to make you
laugh at them, the Volunteers lost to

, Oakland, Charlotte and USC in three

straight games. But the joke is really
on Pitt here, since the Vols had just
defeated the Panthers before going

' on their losing tear.

9. Duke losing to St. John’s. The
fact that St. John’s defeated Duke isn’t
a huge-surprise, but how St.]ohn’s de-

’ feated Duke certainly is shocking. The

WRESTLING

Pitt beats W VU in a close match

Pitt remains undefeated in the Eastern Wrestling League

Mike Fdrlong
Staﬁ Writer

- The wrestling team is still unde-
feated in the Eastern Wrestling
League. ‘

Pitt team out-muscled the West
Virginia Mountaineers in the Back-
yard Brawl Friday night as the Pan-
thers picked up a 21-14 win in front
of a season—high home crowd of
1,287.

On a night the Pitt Athletic De-

, partment promoted as “Fill” the
Fitz,” The Panthers and Moun-
taineers split the match with ﬁve
victories each, but Pitt earned six
bonus points on falls to produce
the difference. -

“The team did a good job. They
started off good and did wel ,” assis-
tant coachjason Peters said. “The
team fought hard, it was a good
night for us.” .

Redshirt junior Tyler Nauman '

alsothought the team put forth a

—- good effort.

“I thought we wrestled really

well. Everyone went out there and
got after it.” Nauman said. “A couple
close matches went the other way,
and I feel like we could’ve gotten
them too and made it a blowout.”

Before the match began, Pitt wel-
comed back 20 wrestling alumni to
the Fitzgerald Field House crowd.

“It’s always great for our guys to
havesupport from the past wres-
tlers here.” Peters said. “For them
to continue to come back to see our
guys wrestle, it’s exciting.”

One of the alumni was Hugh
Peery from the class of 1956. Peery
was described by fellow former
Panthers as a true wrestling leg-
end at Pitt. During his career at the
University, Peery was a three—time
national champion and compiled a
56-1 record in his time. He studied
at the School of Dental Medicine.

Peery comes from a wrestling
family. His father, Rex, was the
head coach at Pitt in the 1950s and
brought theprogram to prominence

in that era. His brother, Ed, was also

athree~time national champion for
the Panthers. '

thought they were doing everything
they could defensively, forcing him

-L to take tough shots.

“I thought we defended as well as
we could,” Dixon said. “I didn’t get
angry with our guys, I said ‘Hey the
kid made a tough shot, we guarded

. it the way we wanted to.’ He made
some incredible shots.”

Pitt started off a bit sluggishly — '

trailing 10-4 -— but was able to stay
close behind forward Nasir Robin-
son’s effort, as he scored six of the
team’s ﬁrst eight points on the way
to a 15-point performance.

" Guard Travon Woodall started
in place of Gibbs and ﬁnished the
game with 12 points, including a key
3-pointer with 6:30 left in the game
to put the Panthers ahead, 54-48,
right after West Virginia scored,

5 bringing the raucous crowd to its
feet. ‘

‘‘He’s played so many‘ minutes
and started games so I wasn’t too
worried about that,” Dixon said

of Woodall’s move to the starting
lineup. “I thought he played a little
better defense.” ‘

As for Gibbs, the team willlbe
cautious with his return to the
lineup. -
“He doesn’t feel pain,” Dixon
said. “He still doesn’t think he’s
hurt. Our trainers are being very
conservative with it.” '

Pitt’s seniors Gil Brown, Brad

Wanamaker and Gary McGhee I

scored nine, 11 and 13 points, re-
spectively, and showed why they’ve
been successful throughout the ma-
jority of their Pitt careers — scor-
ing when the team needed them to
down the stretch.

Leading 59-58 with 3:44 re-
maining, the Panthers needed a
score and Brown was able to drive to
the hoop and convert a layup while
drawing a foul. Not to be outdone,
Wanamaker penetrated the defense
and converted a crucial layup of his
own to make the score 63-58 with

2:04 left.

, Then, on Pitt’s very next pos-
session, Brown got to the hoop yet
again to convert a layup while draw-
ing a foul and making the ensuing
free throw to put the game out of
reach. .

“They just out-manned us,”
coach Huggins said. “They beat us
to death-on the offensive glass and

drove it where they wanted to drive

it, they just out-manned us.

“They drive it more [with Gibbs
being out]. Wanamaker, Brown,
drive it. Robinson_drives it. They
just attack the rim.”

Pitt’s next game is Saturday at

‘ Villanova, another tough road test

for the Panthers. Regardless of
whether they have Gibbs, at least
one coach expects that the Panthers
won’t be rattled — they’ll just play
the way they always do.

Huggins said in a courtside in-
terview, “You never see Pitt get out
of character.” I

major conferences.
5. Michigan State. The Spartans
were ranked No. 2 to start the season,

_ and the green and white faced a daunt-

ingschedule.Alltheteamreallyneeded
was one ortwo bigwins in nonconfer—
ence play, but Michigan State lost four
games before Big Ten playbegan. Then
itlost sixmore. The once-mighty Spar-
tans have oﬂicially hit rock bottom.

4. Syracuse losing four straight.

When Pitt defeated Syracuse in]anuar_'y,_

it sentthe Orange into aspiral oflosing,

where they fell to Villanova, Marquette
and Seton Hall. Not only did they lose
to Seton Hall, but they lost at home ——’

by 22 points. Again, the joke is kind of
on Pitt here as the win didn’t look as

impressive following Syracuse7s los-

ing streakg, but it’s not as bad as with
Tennessee, since the Panthers actually
beat the Orange.‘ V

3. Texas being ranked above Pitt.
This is perhaps the biggest jokeof all.

Pittis inamuchbetter conferencethan
Texas, and Pitthas abetter recordthan
the Longhorns. And, oh yeah, Pittbeat
Texas on a neutral ﬂoor. Granted, the
rankings really don’t mean anything,
but this justperpetuates the feelingthat
Pitt gets overlooked and disrespected,
even when it is aTop steam.

Pitt eyes EWL titles 5

Wrestling '4 12

“It’s great to be back here to see the boys
take on West Virginia. It’s very exciting.”
Peery said prior to the match. “It should be
a good match, but I think we’re gonna get
5 97 ‘ .,
em. _ . .
. At 125 pounds, sophomore Anthony Za-
netta started the match in the same way he

often does, with a fast-paced victory. Zanetta

took down his opponent, Shane Young, and
rode him out for the entire second period.
Zanetta went on to win the match by a score
of 5-3. ,

“I thought Zanetta did a great job tonight.”

5 Peters said. “He focused on wrestling and not

on the outcome and the scoreboard spoke
for him.” - . -
At 133 Pounds, Pitt freshman Shelton

Mack had the tall order offacing off with

No. 15 Nathan Pennesi. Mack stayed close and
entered the third period down only 1-0. After
two Pennesi takedowns in the 3rd period,
Mack fell by a score of 5-2.

Tyler Nauman:

lift takedown in the ﬁrst period and a key
reversal in the third period. . '

Thomusseit’, now ranked No. 20 in the
nation, won his 22nd match of the year, tying

' him for the team lead with redshirt junior

Ethan Headlee. _

, .With junior Zac Thomusseit still out of the
lineup at 197 pounds, senior Phil Sorrentino
continued ﬁlling in for the Panthers, wres-

.. tling up from his usual "165 and 174 pound v

weight classes. Sorrentino wrestled another
tough match, but came up short when Cam-
eron Gallagher scored an escape in the second
period and added an additional point for
riding time. - —

As redshirt senior heavyweight Ryan
Tomei took to the mat, the Panthers held onto
a one-point lead with the score at 15-14. The
Mountaineers sent out senior Kyle Rooney,
the usual starting 197-pounder.

Despite a scoreless ﬁrst period, Tomei
used his size advantage and quickness to es-

“We want the dual meet title, but we
also want the EWL Tournament title too
because We’ve never had that before. i’

At 141 pounds, Nauman, now ranked N o.
8 in the nation, scored eight points in the ﬁrst
period, including a takedown to opponent Mi-
chael Morales’ back, as well as a half-nelson
turn for another three near-fall points. In
the second period, Morales couldn’t escape
anymore as Nauman ﬁnished the match with
a fall at the 4:02 mark. ,

“I really think Tyler is getting back on
track.” Peters said. “We need our stars to

V win to beat good teams.~That’s what they did

tonight. Not only did they get wins, but they
got pins, which is what we needed.”
Following the match, the Mountaineers
were deducted one team point for unsports-
manlike conduct. ~ 4

’ With the Panthers up 9-2, Pitt sophomore A '

Dane Johnson took the mat against former
All-American Brandon Rader. Johnson took
an early 2-0 lead on a double—leg takedown,
before falling 5-4 on a late Rader takedown.
Redshirt sophomore Donnie Tasser pulled
in a dominating 3-0 decision after controlling
Ryan Goodman for most of the match.
After the Mountaineers scored back-to-
back victories at 165 pounds and 174 pounds,

, the Panthers were up just 12-11.
‘Freshman Max Thomusseit helped the 1

Panthers along with a 7-5 victory at 184
pounds. Thomusseit scored on a single-leg

cape from bottom and take down Rooney with i

a single-leg takedown in the second period.
Tomei turned Rooney to his back and ﬁnished

A the bout with a fall. at the 4:31 mark.

""[Tomei] did a good job.” Peters said.

“West Virginia tried to bump a [1] 97—pounder .

up to wrestle him and Tomei did what he’s
supposed to do and he pinned him.”

The fall by Tomei was his 36th of his ca-
reer, putting him into sole possession of 2nd
place on the Panthers all-time pins list behind

only Pat Santoro, now the head wrestling '

coach of Lehigh. _

Nauman said the Panthers should pick up
two solid wins next weekend.

We got Edinboro the week after that,”.
Nauman said. “Edinboro is always a tough
match. It’s not quite as big a rivalry as West
Virginia, but we always want to beat them.
Everyone says they’re having a down year, but
I know they want to try and beat us.”

Nauman said that one of the goals of the
team was to go on and win the EWL dual title
as well as continue on after that. .

2  “We want the dual meet title, but we also
want the EWL Tournament title too because
we’ve never had that before.”
