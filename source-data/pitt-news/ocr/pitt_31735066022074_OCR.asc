Labor Board rules againstfaculty unionization

By David Ballarotto
For The Pitt News

A Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board examiner decided Thurs-
day that Pitt's full—time faculty
cannot unionize.

This preliminary ruling is an
upset to the United Faculty, a

group seeking collective bargain-
ing for more than 1,600 full-time
professors and 700 part-time
teachers and librarians.

The PLRB made the ruling by
using as precedent a U.S.
Supreme Court decision for
Yeshiva University, saying that a
school's faculty are managers and
could not bargain collectively
and manage at the same time.

lnterAction Counci

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Two days of discussion by the
|nterAction Council have drilled
home a common theme: The
world is becoming increasingly
interdependent, and nations as

-well as universities must do all

they can to facilitate internation- _

al co-operation.

Bohdan Lewandowski, former
under secretary general of the
United Nations, said, ”Thinking
must change from a bipolar to a
multipolar approach to the
world.’.’

Economics and technology, the
council agreed, figure to play a

major role in the revamping of in-’

ternational thinking..

In a statement issued Thursday,
University of Pittsburgh President
Dr. Wesley W. Posvar said, ”We
are gratified that the PLRB ex-
aminer has recognized the high
level of share_d management
responsibility [that] our faculty
hold.”

' Posvar also stated, ”Faculty are
colleagues in governance of the
university and we hope that the
outcome of this whole review
will reinforce the standing of the
positive relationship.”

However, United Faculty Presi-
dent Philip Wion said his group
will appeal the decision, ”Penn-
sylvania is the first state where
someone has ruled the federal
precedent ‘should be followed.
We think that was‘a mistake for

”We must encourage the shar-
ing of technology among na-
tions,” said Harvard professor
Lewis Branscomb.

Such sharing, the council con-’

cluded, might_ help bridge present
gaps of economic inequality.

”The prevailing economic ord-
er must change,” said Layachi
Yaker, former Algerian minister to
the United States. ”We need
changes within nations and
among nations. ...’lnterna|ly, poli-
cies in nations must see that there
is a relatively fair distribution of
income.”

The council concluded univer-
sities will have a primary respon-
sibility for shaping future
economic and political thought,
but as Manuel Ullca of Peru

a variety of reasons, and we'll
fight it all the way to the state
Supreme Court.”

University Counsel Lewis Pop-
per believes the PLRB made the
right decision. ”Pennsylvania law
has not been settled for good, but
this was a compelling decision,
in my opinion, and it was the
right decision in my opinion,” he
said.

A crucial factor in the case lies

developing nations are inade-
quately prepared for 'the
challenge of tomorrow. Many, he
said, have terribly limited

resources. Most model their cur— » '

struction.

-”Curriculum in developing na-
tions is not [at] all representative
of national needs,” Ullca said.

While international co-
operation is of primary sig-
nificance, as President Posvar
pointed out, it must not be facili-
tated at the expense of national
identity.

terpretation of the Yeshiva
precedent depends on faculty‘in-
volvement.

”Management depends on de-
cisions made, say, in 95 percent
of the time in key issues involv-
ing the determination and im-
plementation of policy,” Popper
said.

Wion disagreed. ”On being
called managers, [faculty mem-
bers] think it's a joke.  There are
a number of reasons why faculty
should be unionized. Salary is
very important. Professors here,
as elsewhere, have lost 20 per-

should not play a large role in the
case. ”No one would disagree
that I'm management. I don't set
my own salary; the president
does not set his salary. Salary set-
ting is part of budgeting authori-

~ty. Faculty are not here to set

budget; they're here for academ-
ic reasons.”

‘ However, the United Faculty
claimed that academic influence
is attributable to their professional
expertise. The faculty feels they
have no authority, and there are
800 people (involved with the
university) above them.

Popper said those 800 people

are easily identifiable. ”The hear- .

65 limit faces opposition from the White House

WASHINGTON — A 65 mph
speed limit for many rural high-
ways and an $88.6 billion high-
way bill, both approved by the
House, face a minor hurdle in the
Senate but a possible brick wall
at the White House.

The House approved a meas-
ure that would allow states to in-
crease speed limits to 65 mph on
interstate highways outside urban
areas with populations of at least
50,000.

The 21 7-206 vote was seen as
the final meaningful congression-
al test of the speed limit proposal,
because the Senate has gone on
record repeatedly as overwhelm-
ingly favoring it.

That tally came shortly after the
lawmakers passed the highway
measures 407-17, which will dis-
tribute assistance to states and
communities for road and bridge
projects and for mass transit
systems.

”I think people realized the
troops out in the rural areas of our

country weren't abiding by the '

law,” Rep. Kenneth Gray (D-lII.),
an active supporter of the 65 mph

proposal, said after the vote. ”The
American people have spoken.”

Contents of ad replies
are re vealed to bosses

CHICAGO —— A clandestine
group crusading for ”the com-
plete ruination of homosexuality”
ran a newspaper ad seeking
responses from gay men, then
revealed the respondents’ sexual
orientation in letters to neighbors,
landlords and bosses.

The ”Great White Brotherhood
of the Iron Fist,” whose members
have not been identified, has
claimed responsibility for the ads
placed in January in a weekly
Chicago newspaper called The
Reader.

In at least 12 cases, the group
mailed copies of responses to
people who knew the men, along
with a letter saying the individu-
al ”may be a carrier of AIDS,”
said Jonathan Katz of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at the Universi-
ty of Chicago.

The letter warned recipients to
”avoid this homosexual at all

[obs in steel industry
are scarcer than ever

WASHINGTON —— Steel indus-
try employment declined to a
new record low in January, the
14th consecutive monthly record
low since the American Iron and
Steel Institute began compiling
such figures in 1933.

Average employment in Janu-
ary was 150,500, including
110,800 production workers,
compared with 196,300 and
143,900, respectively, in January
1986, the industry trade group
said. December’s average em-
ployment was 154,300 overall
and 1 13,300 production workers.

The drop in employment
paralleled the decreases in steel
industry production and ship-
ments, reported earlier in March
by AISI.

Aquino inspects site

. MANILA, Philippines — Presi-
dent Corazon Aquino traveled to
the Philippine Military Academy
on Thursday to inspect the
damage from a bomb that ex-
ploded the day before, killing
four people and wounding 39
during rehearsals for a weekend
graduation ceremony.

The explosion twisted steel
beams holding the grandstand’s

.roof and hurled roofing tiles and
other material up to 40 yards,
said witnesses.

Academy superintendent Brig.
Gen. Rodolfo Biazon said the ex-
plosion occurred at-the grand-

Director asks FAA to

support new terminal

WASHINGTON — The Feder-
al Aviation Administration has
been asked to pitch in more
money for a proposed $503 mil-
lion midfield terminal at Greater
Pittsburgh International Airport.

Allegheny County Aviation
Director Stephen George, in the
capital with county commission-

‘ ers on their annual lobbying trip,

said he asked the FAA this week
for up to $127 million for the
project.

That amount would match the
state and county commitment to
the new terminal and would be
an increase of approximately $75
million over the amount of fed-
eral money previously expected.

The extra money could en-
courage USAir, the major tenant
at the airport, to sign a Iong—term
lease in the new building.

More federal support would
diminish the size of the loans
needed to pay for construction.

,,Reagan regrets Iran policy

7‘

if‘.

«By Terence Hunt
AP White House Correspondent

WASHINGTON —- President‘

Reagan conceded Thursday night

that his Iranian policy had turned"

into an arms—for—hostages arrange-
ment, and said, ’’I would not go
down that same road again.”

At his first news conference in
four months, Reagan said anew
he was unaware until last
November that profits from the
arms sales had apparently been
funneled to Contra rebels in
Nicaragua, and said he still
doesn't know what happened to
the money.

At a question and answer ses-
sion dominated by the tran-
. Contra affair, Reagan also said he
had never deliberately lied to the
public, while admitting to a mis-

statement at his last news confer- E

ence in November. ’’I’m not
going to tell falsehoods to the

to others,” he said after being
questioned insistently on the
subject.

He told one questioner that for
some time, ”all you knew was
what I told you.” ’

Asked whether disclosure of
the affair had complicated efforts
to free remaining hostages, the
president turned the question
around.‘

”The day that the information
leaked it was my understanding
that the other two were due to get
out in the next few days,” he
said. ”If it hadn't leaked I don't
know  whether we wouldhave
gotten more .out.”

Reagan -opened the 39th news
conference of his presidency by
uttering a ”rock solid” pledge to
veto any attempt in Congress to
raise income tax rates. And he
called on the House and Senate
to adhere to the requirements in
Gramm-Rudman legislation to

”It's time for Congress to cut
the federal budget and leave the
family budget alone,” he said.

The news conference was the
first since Nov. 19, a four-month
period of political and personal
trial for Reagan.

The Iran-Contra affair has
mushroomed into a full—fledged
scandal in _the intervening
months, with the president's
popularity plummeting in the
polls to the lowest level of his
presidency. On the personal side,
Reagan underwent prostate sur-
gery on Jan. 5 and spent several
weeks working on a reduced
schedule.

Thus, many ‘Republicans in
Congress and some administra-
tion officials said in advance that
Reagan needed a skillful,
polished performance at the
news conference to still any
doubts abouthis ability to lead

American people. I'll leave that make new spending cuts. the nation for the next two years.

State Representative Rob
Cowell spoke to Student
Government members last
night about three bills in-
troduced to the House Wed-
nesday which will affect
financial aid for Pennsylvania
students. I

House Bill No. 10, which
Cowell said introduces meas-
ures the state has taken in the
past, would allocate money

‘ for colleges and universities to
purchase updated equipment
and facilities.

The amount stipulated in the
Bill represents $58.00 for
every undergraduate student
enrolled "in "Pennsylvania's
universities. _

of the state Education Commit-
tee, also serves on the State

government] doing nothing for
those students who, because
of financial restraints or'fami-
ly commitments, have got to.

sis," Cowell said. ‘
House Bill No. 961 would
provide $13 million in grants
for part-time students, who
Cowell defined as those stu-
dents carrying six credits or
more. .
House Bill No. 692 is a var-

Where is the good
relationship now?

The Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board hearing examiner
Elliot Newman ruled yesterday that Pitt's full-time faculty mem-
bers are managers and, therefore, cannot unionize.

This comes as an upset to the United Faculty, a group con-
sisting of at least 30 percent of Pitt's faculty who have been
petitioning for the past two years for the right to vote on form-
ing a collective bargaining union. «

In a prepared statement, President Wesley Posvar said that

' he hopes the outcome of the review will reinforce the stand-

ing ”positive” relationship between the administration and the

. faculty. .

How is such a relationship to occur when the faculty knows

‘that several other state schools in Pennsylvania have unionized

faculty? The administrators at these schools do not feel that a
union would separate them from the faculty nor would it cre-
ate an adversarial relationship. The administrators at these
schools realize that the‘ faculty is the core of a productive,
progressive university and, therefore, will try to rrieet their needs-

United Faculty members feel that they do not have enough
authority in the decision-making processes at this university.
They have alsoexpressed discontent with their salaries, likely
to be one of the leading factorsin the administration's fear of
a collective-bargaining unit. .

Students want, — demand —— quality instruction. Quality ,

professors will go where there are fair salaries.

The full PLRB has the opportunity to either reject or accept
Newman's ruling. Should they decide to accept the ruling, the
United Faculty would do well to appeal the decision. For a
school of such size and prestige as Pitt, a fair salary and partic-
ipation in the decision-making process are not unreasonable
demands.

The difference-in sexual appe-
tites can‘be adjusted when the
relationship is good, but you are
right — this one is lousy. If there

is a woman for him, I don’t know _

where. But that is not your
problem. Your problem is that
you even consider leagalizing a
relationship where you work I-ike
a horse, and he makes demands
for dinner, sex and endear-
meants. Get rid of him, begin to

get the sleep you need and never-‘

mind about his getting his.

Q. There is a guy I don’t really
know well but I’ve liked since I
first saw him. He knows I like
him and, as far as I know, he
could care less. What can I do to

get him to like and notice me?

A. You mean it seems he
couldn't care less, not that he
could care less. I don’t usually
give English lessons, but this ex-

pression, that he could care less,

meaning he couldn't care less,
confuses me. My editor tells me
that it is wrong, but I don’t care
about wrong as long as people
understand each other. To get
him to like and notice you, this
is not something I can guarantee.
You can sometimes make him

and everybody else notice you by .

being noisy, but who says he
likes that? ‘

. I think the key to your problem I

shows when you say, ”I really
don’t know him very well.” So
you don’t even know that you
really like him. That is worth find-
ing out. If you see him a lot
(something tells me that you go
to school with him), take note of

what he says and does with his

.,—§

«.-

friendsand be sure you really do I

like him. And then you might tell
this to someone, that you think
he's nice and that will get back
to him. If he is ever going to like
you, this news will encourage
him to do it.

Smokers arebeing denied their rights in Hillman

. The question at hand is a sim-
ple one: Why is the university ad-
ministration spending inordinate

' sums of our finances to refurbish

Hillman-Library, and yet we are
denied our rights to have a facili-
ty in which smoking is permitted?

The university states several
reasons for revoking the
privileges we have enjoyed and
appreciated over the years. The
hypocricy and stupidity of this in-
nane policy should be changed

 promptly.

To begin with, the university is
‘valid in its points of fear of
damage to the newly remodeled

. A library. Unfortunately, there will
I ‘always be students, including

non-smokers, who have no
respect for public property. 
That we cannot change. Despite

I I this, we would like to make

several suggestions that hopeful-

‘ '|y will return our_ smoking

privileges.

We attempted to address the
situation with the library staff but
were quickly dismissed with ‘such
statements as, ,”Smoking is social-'
ly unacceptable inour society.”
Insofar as ”social acceptibility” is
concerned, there are far more
pressing issues in society [that]
need to be addressed! In the
meantime, this new rule has,
several damaging repercussions.

The most important of these is
that it is a detraction from the
quality studying.time of students.
A student must break from their
studying to go indulge them-
selves. Where do they go? Most
seek refuge in the bathroom. This
causes added discomfort to the
non-smoker than the smoker ever
did. Is there a legitimate reason
why we are being forced to be-’

_ have as high school kids? This is-“
. sue never would havearisen 

 

LETTERS  

Hillman Library never had a

- separate section for smoking stu-

dents. However’, they did. We en-
joyed that _right and resent its
being revoked without a decent
explanation, proper notification
and a discussion of possible alter-
natives. ‘ .

The renovation of Hillman
Library is attractive and most ap-
preciated. However in doing so,
they are discriminating against
smokers. The policy is unfair, and
we would like it to be changed.

We understand and respect
that smoking can be offensive;
keeping that in mind, we ask for
one room iniwhich smoking is
permitted..We hope that you will
respect and grant our request, so

-that we_ can continue _to_ respect_

 

the feelings of non-smokers.

Crary and cats E

James Crary," you might agree,
is a remarkable species. We were
interested to see what enlighten-
ment Mr. Crary offered to equate
cats with people. (”Cats are peo-
ple as well,” The Pitt News,
March 18, 1987. What we read
was  well, enlightening."

If Mr. Crary is looking to repeal
the Pennsylvania tax laws, maybe
he should stand on the Highland
Park Bridge and throw cans of cat
food into the river (it worked for
the Boston tea tax).‘Perhaps the
problem is [that] cats are being
taxed withoutrepresentation. Mr.
Crarygcould next propose a Kitty
Senate or House of Cats (not to
be confused with a cat house) to

 

address the problems of Pennsyl-
vania cats. After confronting the
pressing issue of cat food taxa-
tion, the pussy politicos could ad-
dress the problems of unwed

-’j)

I’'\_

feline mothers or the increasing '

number of street cats.

If, however, Mr. Crary is just
looking for a delectable repast for
for lovable Grendel, we reco-
mend the lobster.. If Grendel is
that necessary, then it deserves
the best. Maybe on a student
budget, tuna fish would be more
feasible. Neither is taxed.

No doubt, Mr. Crary would
gladly pay the tax on cat food if
only he realized that his tax dol-
lars will help keep alive thou-
sands of cats in shelters until
other Pennsylvanians find cats as
necessary as he does.

Balancing eggs and more

What follows are a few
thoughts and observations on Pitt
and the world in general.

0 Why are time schedules kept
in Thackeray Hall, and course
descriptions in the CAS Advising
Center? Would it not make more
sense to keep them in the same
place?

0 It's true, red M&Ms are back!

0 The vernal equinox occurs at

rive in the Northern Hemisphere.
Legend has it that it is possible to.
balance an egg on its fat end at
that precise moment. Try it.

0 If there were a Nobel Prize
awarded for general wisdom,
whoever said ”never move in
with your best friend” would win

V hands down_.

0 If the refuse on the sidewalks
is any indication, condom use is
up markedly in America's most
livable city. .

0 Last week's episode of Fami-
ly Ties ("My Name is Alex Kea-
ton”), was a welcome departure
from the "usually mindless fare 0
network television. 1’

'0 Sit in Forbes Quad someday
and watch how many people
avoid walking under the sculp-
tures that hang from the ceiling.

0 John Poindexter needs an
enema.

0 The latest doctrinal edict
from Rome, the one that calls test

tube babies and sperm banks -im-,

moral, is bound to be followed

' about as closely by American

Catholics as they follow Human-
ae Vitae (the one that prohibits
use of contraception).

0 If you don't know it, under-
graduate advising for fall term has
started already.

This is the story of an addict,
and that addict is me.‘

I have been patronizing the

Oakland bars sincegrade school.
Thén I saw nothing wrong with
it, hitting the bars once a week or
so. But since coming to college,
I have been going there much
more often. Last week I went five
times, sometimes with friends
and sometimes alone.

I do not want help. It is already
too late. There is nothing that can
keep me from the bar scene.

The salad bar scene, that is.

I'll never understand how,,Joe

Schmoe (a fictitious name) could‘

walk into Wendy's and order a
hamburger‘ and french fries
when, for the same price, he
could buy enoughfood to feed
three sororities. OK,\ two
sororities. '

He could horde every last cling
peach, and someone would bring

.' him more. What's more, he
'1. could eat lunch and stick around

fordinner and a late-night snack
and even breakfast the next
morning if he hides‘ in the
bathroom overnight. '
Schmoe could choose from
five Oakland bars if you count
Roy Rogers twice. Personally, I'd
rather Rax, but everybody is en-
titled to their individual prefer-
ences. Roy Rogers offers two
locations and goldfish crackers;
Wendy's has a round salad bar
and a basket of bread logs; and
Burger King has red gelatin with
carrots in it. '

I have establi~shed_office hours‘

don't think anybody was looking.
I used the ladle to stuff the salad

ate it without dressing.

set a salad-bar tomato atop his
roast beef sandwich, it is her
responsibility to repossess that

equinox

tomato and direct the offender "to-

the works baron the lower level.

Another high-crime salad bar is
Wendy's. Their new chili tastes
especially good with salad-bar
cheese, and people are not shy
about walking to the bar and
helping themselves. At Roy
Rogers on Forbes Avenue, the
salad bar sits between two en-
trances, making it convenient for
someone to enter from‘Forbes
Avenue, walk past the salad bar
and sneak ahandful of goldfish
crackers onto Oakland Avenue.

Don't get any ideas.

You might upset the regulars,
the same people who frequent
the same bars at the same time
nearly every day. For instance, I
usually see Lyresa at Rax. The
salad bartenders have never no-
ticed that Lyresa always smuggles
her own can of Diet Coke inside
her oversized purse. But that is
our secret. Most of the other
barhoppers are nameless faces,
bodies to crash into while walk-
ing the wrong way around the
salad bar.

Incidentally, the right wayto

.walk around the salad bar is

counterclockwise. But you prob-
ably wouldn't know that unless
you were an addict — like me.
Not that it bothers me. I'm in no

hurry to order a-hamburger — at

least not until after the latest
batch of Rax salad coupons ex-
pires next week. A

And probably not then, either. .

Greene sees the
best in America

Hi. Bob couldn't make it
today, so I'm filling in for
him as best I can.

He tried to get here, of
course, but the column he
wrote is lost somewhere —
perhaps pigeon-holed at a
post office in Peoria —
rather than here with us in
Pittsburgh.

I spoke with him the
other day.

He was on the road
somewhere gathering the
material for another
column about America.
Bob Greene has one of the
finer newspaper beats in
America because the nation as a whole is his story source. He
is paid to travel and write about what he sees.

His column and his books (eight in all) are not high-browed
pontifications about what's right or wrong with what he sees.
In his writing, we are afforded a chance to view only what is
there —- whether it be a man selling urine in Texas or a young
boy dying after his liver transplant failed in a hospital in
Pittsburgh;

”Column writing is almost like letters from home or getting
letters from a friend,” he said. ”What I do is still reporting, but
it's reporting of a different kind.

"I'm reporting on the way people live their lives." ‘

Greene grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and started working for
a newspaper at the age of 17. Unlike many reporters who con-
centrate on how they are writing, for Greene the writing seems

 

DIRK
KAUFMAN

to be only the medium for themessage, not an art to be fussed A

over. _
That message is one that arises from "the common man in

America. When he does speak to the rich or fashionable in this '

country, it is with the same shy fascination and awe we all have.
"I feel like I know my readers, and they know me," he said.
"I like the idea of reaching the people in your hometown every
morning with the news that happened the night before.”
He has not forgotten that newspapers are not solely printed
to inform the public of political scandal or about the lives of
men who are paid millions of dollars to throw a baseball.
How much does it matter to us all that Gary McLain was ad-

dicted to drugs? Does it matter that Rick Rhoden is now play- '

ing for the New York Yankees? Should the political position
of Mario Cuomo result in fascination for us? A -
Ultimately, what highly publicized individuals do or think
doesn't matter to the rest of us. Greene seems to understand
this, _and he travels back and forth across. America to find the
people doing the same things all of us are doing —— or finding
and talking to the people who do the things most can ‘only

- dream of doing.

Do not doubt that Greene is quite well off doing what he does. I

_ Bestselling books and nationally syndicated columns, as well

as spot stories on Nightline, do not leave him without substan-*
tial reward- ~

But the reward, as with the art of writing, is not the point.
Again, it is the opportunity to tell a story that is his prime moti-
vation for being in the business. It's all there in the stories he
tells. I

When I talked with him the other day, each question cam
from a three page list I had compiled, and hislwords were
recorded on tape as they came over the phone. I asked him
about his interviewing technique. ' ’

'’I never have a list of questions, and I never use atape record- '

er,” he said. . ~
. He went on to tell me that Ted Koppel never uses one on
Nightline and that the list and recorder only take away from
the effectiveness of an interview. ~

Boy, did‘! feel like a jerk. ' I

But then he told me about his tie, which is loose in all his
photographs. I wondered what kind of image he was trying to
present to the public.

”I have these memories of when I was about 9 years old and I

getting ready to go to dancing school at the YWCA in Colum-   

bus,” he said. '’I remember my dad buttoning the top button
of my shirt and yanking my tie up against my throat.

"I remember how constrained I felt. It's still very hard for'me'

to wear a tie all the way up. I feel like I'm in jail.”
If you've ever worn a tie, you know what he's talking about.

I As it turned out, he wasn't trying to present an image at all —

‘a simple point that doesn't really matter, but it's comforting in
a way. ' ‘
‘Bob will be back Monday. It's hard to tell what his subject

will be then. Whether good or bad, I'll read it, if only because _-I ‘

Bob Greene wrote it.
He'll be here in person next Friday for the Writers’ Confer-
ence. I don't know about you, but I can't wait to meet him.

syndicated columnist from Ruffs Dale, Pa.

By Sandy Rhodes

For The Pitt News

The Nicaraguan Ambassador to
the United States told a group of
law students that the people of
Nicaragua want peace with the
United States.

Nora Astorga, who spoke Tues-
day night at Pitt's law school, said
her government wants a relation-
ship with the United States but
also wants to be nonaligned with
any nation. _

”The relationship between the
United States and Nicaragua,
historically, has not been the best
of relationships,” said Astorga.

”We have been trying since 1981
to try [to] talk to the Reagan ad-
ministration to say, ’If you are
concerned about Nicaragua, why
don't we talk about it? Why don't
we sit down and see what your
concerns are and what our con-
cerns are and try to find a way
out?’ ” '
According to Astorga, the
Nicaraguan government wants
peace and is willing to negotiate.
She said, ”My government knew
the concerns of the United States
about having Nicaragua become
a military Soviet base, and we
have told them [the U.S.] very
openly and have repeated it

 THE P|'lT N

several times, that we are not"
willing to become a military base
of any foreign country. And we
are willing to sign any type of
treaty in that sense.”

Astorga continued, ”The Rea-
gan administration is not willing
to change its policy toward
Nicaragua. And this policy, un-
fortunately, is causing problems
in Nicaragua. Not only is the poli-
cy causing a lot of economic
damage and a lot of death in
Nicaragua, but [it is also] causing
problems in other countries in
Central America. Nicaragua is the
direct victim of the Reagan
policy.”

Concrete Blonde

Post-punks prove it's OK to sing nice songs too

By Dave Zafris

She's not blonde, OK? Some
bands have integrity. They don't
feel that they have to portray a
false image for the discriminat-
ing public.

Then again, some bands try
and don’t succeed.

"I tried to bleach my hair
blonde — and it all fell out," said
Johnette Napolitano, the sultry
yet hardened singer for Con-
crete Blonde, who will be per-
forming at Grafitti next Tuesday
night.

”So now my hair's black and
about five inches long. lt’s grow-
ing back, though.”

The name Concrete Blonde
may not fit the band's appear-
ance, but it certainly fits their
music. Napolitano’s singing
voice has a softness and vulner-
ability not found in post-punk
rock bands from LA. But she can

”l used to blow out a lot more
than I do now. l think that sub-
tlety is a lot more important,”
she said.

On their debut album, Con-
Crete B/onde,
proves she's willing to take

Napolitano.

2 also wail with the best of them. .

chances. ln ”Can Make Me‘

Cry," she sings in asultry voice

‘that anyone’s. mother would like,

backed by guitarist Jim Man-

key’s acoustic strumming.

Then her voice explodes into
the pseudo—punk cover tune
”Still ln Hollywood."

”lt would be boring to play
the same kind of things all the
time," said Mankey. "At differ-
ent times, you feel different ways
— so we make different kinds of
songs/'

Concrete Blond sounds a lot
different from paisley-covered
bands that came out of L.A. in
the early '80s. ' .

ln l980, Napolitano’ m
lvlankey while they were both
working for Leon Russell's back-
up band.. Russell moved to
Nashville, and Napolitano and
Monkey decided to stay in L.A.
and start a new band.

They finally’ settled on the
name Dream 6 — like a bunch of
other Southern" California bands
with the ”dream" in their
names.

But by the time Dream 6 got
a recording contract with IRS,
L.A._'s "-Paisley Underground”
had psyched itself out. So the
band set out to change their
name.

Labelmate and rock guru
Michael Stipe of R.E.lvl. said the
band sounded like a ”concrete

,blonde," because their sound is
tough sometimes and sexy other

’’It came back to us that
Michael thought that up, and
everybody liked it," lvlankey

‘said. ”We realized it was time

to change our name."
Ivlankey declined to analyze
Stipe's reasoning.

“We

the other bands play-
ing in LA. I don’t know

--y Jim Mankey

”lt’s hard to say what thatguy
really means. But if you don't
think about it too hard, he al-
ways seems to mean some-
thing,” he said. -

One reason for Stipe's obser-
vation might be Concrete
Blonde's diversity — cutting from
fuzzy guitars- to light acoustic

._~melodies in the middle of a set.

That's because the band is
heavily influenced bysuch psy-
chodelic relics as'Cream and
Jimi Hendrix. And their album
sounds a lot like —— shield your

lin was adept. at having sharp
distinctions in their music, citing
their radical mood changes.

She likes Led Zeppelin so

much that she sent a copy of «

their album to Jimmy Page in
hopes that he would produce
Concrete Blonde's next effort.

’’I’m sure we had different in-
fluences from the other bands
around us, because we never
really matched up with the other

said.

”l don’t know what they

But don’t think Concrete Blond

That reggae “riddim”

THE GLADIATORS
Graffiti
March 12, 1987

By Karen Michele Gardner

Reggae is finally beginning to
be heard in Pittsburgh.

It was reggae night last Thurs-
day as the Dub Squad, maybe
the hottest local Reggae band,
opened for the Gladiators.

Dub Squad kicked the show

‘off with one of their original

jams, "Where I Stand.”

Curt Resch, lead guitarist and
vocalist, screamed into the
microphone: "ls everybody
feelingall right!?" The crowd
shouted back an emphatic:
IIYes!I/-

Dub Squad has come a long
way. Their music isn't rootsy —
it's crossover reggae. It's. uplift-
ing and exciting.

The Ethiopian, one of Jamai-

 ca's original reggae artists,

want to hear one kind of music.

''I'm the same person who
-sings 'Still ln Hollywood,’ so I

, think it's stupid that some want

to hear other stuff I want to
play," Napolitano said.

The band has also entered the
'pre—fabricated realm of MTV.

"Half of me is grateful to it,
and half of me says there's so
much shit on MTV that they're
lucky to have something decent
to play. '

"So in spite of the guilt feeling '

that l have for participating in
such a sham of a medium, l
guess I'm glad we're on MTV,"
she said.

rocked the crowd in a different
way.

The "riddim" and the vibe
were just right on that night.
Anyone there .could tell the
difference between crossover
reggae and roots reggae.

Crossover isn't solely from
Jamaica because it's mixed with
pop and rock music.

Roots reggae is pure reggae
—- the way it's played in
Jamaica.

The Ethiopian had everybody
who was anybody up skanking
with "Dread-lock Prophecy."

The headlining act, The Gladi-
ators, put on an enthusiastic
show, but the audience didn't
participate to its fullest.

But The Gladiators sound bet-
ter live than they do on~record.

-It was a night of peace, love,
brotherhood and joyous vibra-
tion —— and a lot of skanking.

THE JOSHUA TREE
U2
Island Records

By Jerome Thomas Newton

The Joshua Tree is the name
of a plant indigenous to the
American Southwest. The cli-
mate in which the tree thrives is
as dusty and desolate as the mu-
sical and lyrical landscape of

U2's fifth album.

U2 close to self-parody

in Joshua Tree — but

The Joshua Tree is also the
name of a seedy motel in which
country-rock pioneer Gram Par-
sons died from a drug and alco-
hol overdose in l974.

Again, the significance of the
album title rings true. Death and
the nightmare of drug addiction
seemed to have blanketed the
lives of some of the band's
‘closest friends and have provid-
ed the subiect of two of the
record's finest songs, "One Tree

that's not all that bad

Hill" and "Running to Stand
Still."

But the most significant Parsons
connection is that American
country—blues has colored the
trademark "U2 sound," which
has, at times, veered danger-
ously close to self—parody. The
Edge's much imitated staccato
guitar figures are still in great
abundance ("Where the Streets

' Have No Name" and "l Still

Closet REO ran reveals high infidelity

LIFE AS WE KNOW IT
REO Speedwogon
Epic Records

By Ike Shibley

The affliction could be diag-
nosed as pop susceptibility. The
obvious symptom is an abnormal
amount of top 40 music in one’s
record collection. The illness is
often accompanied -by feelings
of guilt whenever a pop album
is purchased.

The Joshua Tree

continued from page I0

Haven't Found What l’m Look-
ing For") as he remains the sin—'
gle most rhythmic ”lead”
guitarist in rock.

His chiming eigth note attacks

6 on The Joshua Tree provide as

strong a pulse as the drumming
of Larry Mullen Jr. What saves
the record from an oversatura—

tion of relaxed tempos is the ap— .

pearance of the dobro and
acoustic guitar shadings that
creep into the mix on ”Trip
Through Your Wires" and ”Run-
ning to Stand Still.” '

Even though these two exam-
ples don't allow the band ‘to
serve up the ”fire” they so often
sing about, the expanded in-
strumentation adds to the impact
of what is easily one of the most
beautiful recordings of the year.

I must reluctantly admit that, at
times, I suffer from this not-so-
horrible sickness. The most re-
cent manifestation of my tenden-
cy to be overcome by pop sus-
ceptibility has been my purchase
of REO Speedwagon's new al-
bum [ife As We Know /1‘.

Despite a lot of harassments
from friends and enemies alike,
l hear a lot that l like on this
album. . -

Five out of the IO songs are
some of the best they have ever

 

recorded (which may not mean
that much to some people),
while the other half are so-so.

The best song on the album,
and possibly the best that they
have ever done, is‘ ”ln My
Dreams," a tender ballad that
plays more smoothly and more
emotionally than ”Keep on
Lovin' You." It is clearly the
highlight of the record.

”New Way to Love,” ”One
Too Many Girlfriends" and
”Can't Get You Out of My

Heart" are typical Speedwagon
numbers, having a light lyrical
content reinforced with a
pleasant blend of rock rythms.

REC Speedwagon doesn’t,try
to hide their weaknesses. In-
stead they play to their
strengths. They have no- political
messages and no stylized views
of life. Their music is simple, as
are their lyrics. Sometimes it is
relaxing to listen to music simply
so that we can forget about life
as we know it.

Life is not quite as simple as in
an REO song or as in a John
Hughes film. But like the movies
Hughes’ produces, REO albums
do serve their purpose. They
give their listeners a simplistic
view of life that is a welcome
relief in the complicated era in
which we live. lf only life as we
know it were like an REC song,
then maybe people could
emanate the happiness that this
group does in almost everything
they do. , ‘ ‘

Bono’s voice is once again the
band's dominant instrument, but
his lyrics are no more lucid than
in the past. (Has anyone ever in-

voked more images of the sky -

and the sea?) ln one instance,
after completing a somewhat
muddled lyric about a destitute
”red hill town," the singer felt
compelled to title the song ”Red
Hill Mining Town," in order to
clarify the message of the song.

However, all of Bono’s am-
biguities are forgiven when he
slides effortlessly into his upper
register at_the.climax of "With
or Without You," a gorgeous
single and a fine example of
howgreat passion can be creat-
ed by U2's most subtle musical
arrangements.

Since the number of bands

ences between the music of
Crowded House and Bruce
Hornsby and also the differ-
ences in the audiences they
attract.

But when asked if he thought
_a tour pairing the two was a bit
odd he replied, ''It is, and it isn't.
When we perform to Bruce's
audiences, they are very warm
towards us.

"Basically, we will tailor our

‘show to our audience, l sup-

pose, and see which way the
audience is going to go. And
then we try [to] take them
there."

Seymour cites The Talking
Heads, Los Lobos, World Party,
XTC and the Woodentops as
current musical influences — as
well as the Beatles being a
maior influence for band front-
man, Neil Finn.

Seymour is also an artist and

a film and set director. He at-
tended art school for five years
and is involved in the art and set
direction for the band's videos
and live perofrmances, as well
as being solely responsible for
the creation of the Crowded
House album cover.

"An album cover should have
some input of the artist. I basical-

‘ly wanted to, in some way, ex-

tend the individual personalities
of the members fo the group
onto the actual cover."

The cover is layout of the trio
in three distinct positions, iuxta—
posedon top of a quilt—like open
space that Seymour believes is
"indicative of a stage.” Each
space that the band members
occupy is to be indicative also of
their individual roles within the
band.

Seymour describes himself as
the artistic one in "the Pablo
Picasso designed suit," while

He also spoke of an amusing
story behind one of the other
songs on the album written en-
tirely by Finn, "Mean to Me."

"The song's about a girl who
came all the way from America
to New Zealend and contacted
Neil's parents and basically
made her prescence felt so much
that Neil's parents organized [a

meeting with Neil] in this small
hotel that he was playing a gig
in a couple of summer's ago.

''It's [the song] talking about
why she would spend so much
creative energy actually just
meeting a person that writes
songs. lt's hard for somebody
who is a public figure to be
responsible for people's getting
out of control in their life 
whether they can actually be
held responsible for the way
people perceive them and them-
selves."

Finn later met up with the girl
again in Los Angeles when
Crowded House was playing
live. Fortunately for Finn, at least
according to Seymour, the girl
felt that the song had "changed
her life."

Billy Osborn in the paint during the winter-...

Three sport
Osborn is
ready for
the spring

By Thomas Zuc
Staff Writer '

When some students gooff to
school for the first time, their
mothers sometimes tell them that
they should make the most of
their free time.

In Bill Osborn’s case, he may
have _taken his mother too
seriously.

In three years at Pitt, Osborn
has been on three athletic teams.
He plays football (the sport he
was recruited for out of high
school) in the fall, basketball in
the winter, and now, with spring
approaching quickly, Osborn is
in Florida with the baseball team.

With three different coaches to
whom he has to answer, it is vir-
tually inevitable that there will be
conflicts of interests between Os-
born and these same coaches.

Last yearat this time Osborn

had a small run-in with head foot-

ball coach MikeGottfried.

It was Gottfried’s first year, as
the Panthers coach, and he need-
ed to evaluate the talent on his
team. But Osborn chose to go to
Florida with the.-baseball team.
When he came back, Gottfried

took disciplinary measures‘

against him.

”He [Gottfried] needed me
there in the spring "to evaluate me
and the team as a whole,’’ said
Osborn. _

Now, though, the problem is
resolved. ”We have talked about

please see Osborn, page '14,

both sides of the coin   A

... and on the gridiron during the spring and fall.

Pro Dayprovides scouts with
good look at Panthers’ talents

By Thomas Danyluk’
Staff Writer

Yesterday the Pitt football pro-

gram held its annual Pro Day,
providing an opportunity for the
juniors of the squad to display
their talent to professional scouts.

”lt’s a way for NFL teams to get
an early look at the upcoming
college talent,” said Pitt head
coach Mike Gottried. ”Most- Di-
vision I-A schools, like Penn State
and Miami, have something quite
similar to this. Scouts from a lot
of these clubs come to get an idea
of what will be available in future
drafts.” ,

The Seattle Seahawks, Dallas
Cowboys and the world champi-
on New York Giants were just a
few of the teams that attended the
event that marked the advent of
spring football drills.

- The format of thiscrude evalu- ‘
.ation is quite simple: Each‘ play-A

 

er runs two timed 40-yard dashes,
giving scouts a small sample of
what the players can do on the
field.

”It’s really not much to go by,”
said Gottfried, ”but these [scouts]
will have something to refer to
when the real evaluation starts.
The times that they're clocked at
today will categorize them for the
rest of their college careers. Of
course, if they're offered a ‘tryout

' with a team, they'll have to run

it [the 40-yard dash] for them
again.” .

The upcoming sophomores
and juniors also participated in
the event, but their activity was
monitored solely by the'Pitt assis-
tant coaches. ”’We’ve just com-
pleted _ our indoor workouts,”
said Gottfried. ”This is a good op-
portunity to get everyone reac-
customed to practicing outside.”
2 On Wednesday,-theseniors of

‘the 986., team held. their ‘own

 

separate workouts forthe profes-
sionals. ”A whole bunch of teams
— Detroit, Seattle, the Giants and

Jets, Houston, Miami —‘ they «
were all watching us run sprints,” ’

said fullback Tom Brown, who
participated along with Lorenzo
Freeman, Tony Woods, Steve
Apke and Keith Tinsley. ”They
usually hold these type of work-
outs for the seniors who aren't in-
vited to the league-sponsored
scouting combine.”

‘ Incidentally, Brown, Dixon and
Woods were among those invit-
ed to the Indianapolis Hoosier
Dome, the site of this year's NFL
combine.

Women swimmers 
head   for N CAAS   

By Jeannette Ayoob
For The Pitt News

This 4 weekend eight Pitt
women swimmers will com-
pete in the NCAA Champion-
ships in Indianapolis, Ind. This
is the largest number of swim-
mers to qualify from one
school.

Leading Pitt's contingence is
senior Sue Hickman and ‘fresh-
man Sandy Albright who were
named the outstanding swim-
mers of the 1987 Big East
Championships. Also attend-

_ ing will be seniors Jodi O'Neil
and Tracey Pfister, juniors
Cindy Rose and Mariam Cas-
sidy, sophomore Tricia Rickert
and freshman Laure Walzak.

Albright, O'Neil, Walczak
and Hickman make up the
strong 200-yard medley relay

team which set the meet

record of 1:45.77 at this year's

Big East meet. Walczakand.  I ll

it, and he wants me to get up
there for football as much as pos-
sible,” added Osborn. ”Just so I
know where I stand and to know
some plays and get involved with

the offense, especially the quar— .
-terback, whoever [he] is.”

Spring football practices, which
begin this Saturday, prove valua-
ble.— not only to Osborn — but
every other player aswell. ’’It
keeps the mind fresh with foot-
ball,” said Osborn.

And this freshness seems as if
itlwillbe sorely needed by next
season. With three new freshman
quarterbacks being brought in for
next year, an experienced
receiver like Osborn could help
clear the confusion surrounding

’ the quarterback positionbefore

any of the new recruits arrive.
”Coach Gottfried .and I have

"talked about the situation, and he

knows what I want, and I know
what he wants,” said Osborn.

Last season Osborn took a few
days off after football to rest and
get ready for another sport a
basketball.

‘ He chose, however, to discuss
the idea with basketball coach
Paul’ Evans, who recruited Os-
born when he was at the Naval

" Academy. Osborn, a 6-0 junior,

felt Evans needed to understand
that when baseball season rolled

around he would leave the
basketball team.

Osborn just wanted to squelch
any possibility of a controversy
that could have arised.

”Coach Evans knew I played
baseball, and I discussed that
with him at the beginning of the
year,” said Osborn. ”But we did
have an agreement that when it
came time for baseball I would
join theteam.”

But playing in only two basket-
ball games all year made this de-
cision easier.

’’If it would have been a differ-
ent situation if I was being count-
ed on“ as a major player during
the games and was one of the first
guys off the bench,” said Osborn.
’’In that situation, it would have
been hard [to leave]. But that was
not the situation and I didn't hurt
the team by doing this.”

So last Wednesday evening

when the basketball team left on .

a plane for Tucson, Ariz., to com-
pete in the NCAA tournament,
Osborn stayed in Pittsburgh for a
few days. Then he hopped on a

plane 4- but this one was head-.

ed for Florida. a
Osborn said that he will prob-
ably not play basketball next year
making hima two-sport star.
”I just came out to help.the
basketball team this year,” said
Osborn. ”I don't think I'll change

Pitt baseball" coach Bobby
Lewis said he has no objections

to Osborn playing three sports. .

”Iust as long as he keeps his
schoolwork up,” said Lewis.

Getting into the swing for the
Pitt baseball season, which began

on Monday, should not be too

difficult for Osborn. ”Physically,
he is ready,” said Lewis. ”He has
done more running for basketball
than he will have to do for base-
ball. It is a different kind of get-
