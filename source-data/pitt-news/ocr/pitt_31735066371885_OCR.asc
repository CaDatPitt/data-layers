SGB discusses
proposed aid cuts

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

The state legislatures proposal to
limit financial aid only to students
whose families’ annual incomes are
less then $32,000 prompted the Stu-
dent Government Board to discuss
the available tactics to combat the
proposal.

According to Student Govern-

ment president Luke Kluchko, there
will be an open forum on Monday,
March 18, to further organize plans
for a student writing campaign to

their district representatives.

“We have to get moving. The stu-
dents have to be educated on how
this may effect them. If the proposal
is accepted, it could mean losing up
to one-third of their student aid,”
Kluchko said. “It's important to get
as many students as possible
involved in writing letters. Letters

Recommendations of the uni-
versity’s Five-year Plan have
been finalized and will be offi-
cially released April 19, accord-
ing to Dr. Roger Ahlbrandt,
associate provost for planning
and development.

“We have modified a number
of the preliminary recommenda-
tions as a result of the past 90
days of responses that we have
received from the various
schools,” Ahlbrandt said.

The provost‘s office circulated
a draft to all the deans that sum-
marized their respective areas.

“They have been kept abreast,

so it is not as if they are seeing it
for the first time,” explained
Ahlbrandt.

Following the March 19
release, a 30-day response period
will ensue.

“Anyone within the university
community or outside may com-
ment or respond to President
Posvar,” Ahlbrandt said. “The
President and whomever he
chooses, most likely executive
staff members, will review, mod-
ify or change based upon the
responses he receives.”

President Wesley Posvar will
issue the final plan for the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s future in
May. In late May or early June,
the plan will be submitted to the
board of trustees.

Breast cancer study
revolutionizes treatment

By Joelle Latine
The Pitt News

On Wednesday, a press confer-
ence was held at Scaife Hall to
release information concerning a
new and better way of removing can-
cerous tumors of the breast.

The project, which began in l97l,
is headed by Dr. Bernard Fisher,
project chairman for The National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Projects, which is headquartered at
the University of Pittsburgh. It is an

international, multi-disciplinary,

cooperative group of 500 specialized
physicians working in more than 100
major medical centers and hospitals

Fazio

throughout the U.S., Canada,
France and Australia. The National
Cancer Institute has contributed
$5.5 million to the study.

In the past, surgeons have treated
breast cancer by removing the entire
breast, along with the surrounding
tissue and muscle. Dr. Fisher has
found that removal of only the
tumor in the breast is often all that is
necessary. This procedure reduces
the physical disﬁguration and emo-
tional strain that women experience
when undergoing a radical
mastectomy.

The medical point in question was
whether radical mastectomy (re-
moval of the entire breast, lymph
nodes and pectoral muscle) was
always necessary. Fisher now has
conclusive data to support the new

suspends wide

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Another Pitt football player has
been suspended from the team after
involvement in a dormitory incident
Feb. 7.

Freshman Tony Williams, a wide
receiver who was redshirted last sea-
son, has been indefinitely suspended
by Coach Foge Fazio after allegedly
punching a female student in the
face.

It is not known how long the 6-7,
220-lb. native from Freedom, Pa.,
will be barred from the team as
Fazio did not return any phone calls
to The Pitt News yesterday.

Reached early last night, Williams
refused to discuss the suspension.
“There’s just no comment. I have
nothing to say about it.”

He was scheduled to appear
before District Magistrate Nicholas
Diulus at 9 a.m. today in his Atwood
Street chambers. Fourth-yearjunior
Staci Camp, 21, filed one count of
simple assault against Williams.

She is seeking monetary compen-
sation for suffering what she de-
scribed as a bruised cheekbone and
other facial swelling.

The action comes in the wake of
two other recent dormitory inci-
dents involving freshmen football
players. Late last week tailback
Craig “Ironhead” Heyward of Pas-
saic, N..I., was handed several sanc-
tions, including a one-year football
suspension, after reportedly attack-
ing two students with a wooden
crutch Jan. 22 in Tower A.

Earlier this week, a Judicial Board
panel of five students assigned safe-
ty/quarterback Dante Wiley of
Jeannette several sanctions for
allegedly punching another fresh-
man in the face. Among them was a

medical expenses. Vice President of
Student Affairs Conney Kimbo has
yet to accept or reject those recom-
mendations. The incident occurred
on Lothrop Hall’s 12th floor.

Camp‘, a Pittsburgh native major-

ing the simple assault charge against

In selection of patients to be stu-

confined to the breast or breast and
auxiliary lymph nodes; measure
four centimeters or less; be movea-

muscle and chest wall; and that there
be no evidence of skin involvement.
The breast also had to be of suffi-
cient size and the tumor had to be’
located so that following its remov-
al, the cosmetic result would be ade-

tumors are more amenable.

Crowds of cheering Greeks filled,
half of Roy Rogers in the Cathedral
basement Wednesday night to coax
one another to victory in the Greek
Gorge, one ofthe events taking place
in this year's Greek Week.

Twenty-four fraternities and 12
sororities ate 450 roast beef sand-
wiches (150 lbs. of beef) in a contest
in which the first person to eat seven
sandwiches for the men or five sand-
wiches for the women wins a trophy
and a $250 check donated in his
name to Eye and Ear Hospital.
Second-prize winners were given
$50 checks to be donated.

Among the fraternities, Fiji took
first place, Phi Dclts took second
and Alpha Epsilon Phi took third.
Delta Phi Epsilon took first place
for the sororities, with Kappa Delta
in second and Kappa Kappa
Gamma in third place. The average
contestant took five minutes to pig

  LCB under fire

HARRISBURG, Pa.(UPI)—
The Thornburg administration
yesterday accused the Liquor
Control Board of knowingly
awarding a contract worth more
than $11 million to a trucking
company convicted of fraud and
whose ownership has been iden-
tified as having ties with organ-
ized crime.

The allegation was contained
in the latest of a recent series of
bitter written exchanges between
the administration and the LCB,
which Thornburg has long
sought to dismantle. The admin-
istration’s letter, signed by
Thornburg’s press secretary
David Runkel, was sparked by a
letter earlier in the day to the
governor from LCB chairman
Daniel Pennick.

In his letter, Runkel says the
trucking contract is about to
erupt into a scandal that “will
engulf the LCB.” He says the
company has been convicted of
fraud in federal court and its
ownership has been identified by
the state crime commission as
having ties to organized crime.
According to Runkel, Gary Div-
ito, the chief counsel of the LCB,
was informed of the company’s
criminal history and its ties to
organized crime prior to his
recommendation ofthe contract,
later approved by the board.

The press secretary says the

The Pitt News

Some enterprising Pitt students
are launching their own businesses
now.

“I like the feeling of owning some-
thing and working for my dream
rather than working for someone,”
explained Tom Reinsel, a freshman
computer science major who owns a
small computer consulting business.

Reinsel purchases, installs and
assists in setting up computers for
local businesses.

“I've got what it takes to make it
on my own,” he explained. Ten years
ago, a student’s extra-curricular
activity was probably protesting on
campus. Today, the tide is turning
toward enterprise. -

There are atleast 65 self-made
millionaires in the country under the
age of 18, according to the National
Federation of Independent Busi-
ness. In fact, 33 percent of all new
businesses are founded by entrepre-

neurs 30 years old and younger.
“An entrepreneur is an innovator.
He looks at the world and sees it as
an opportunity," stated Ted
Schwab, an undergraduate in CAS
who is also a real estate developer.

Schwab is the co-founder of the
Association of Collegiate Entrepre-
neurs here at Pitt. ACE is a national
entrepreneurial club for students
who wish to discuss small business.

Many student enterprises, like
Reinsel’s computer consultation
business, begin as hobbies, but the
student has developed his interest
into a profitable career.

Scott Kramer, a CGS business
student, used to mow lawns. Now he
owns a small landscaping business.

“I like working on my own time.
But a major disadvantage is trying to
manage school and work — espe-
cially in the fall and spring terms,
when I cut grass all day and then go
to school. It can be difficult,” Kra-
mersaid.

In addition to landscaping, Kra-
mer has just bought into a disc
jockey business. Kramer always has
“something going all the time.”

“I used to take my wagon to the
little league games and sell ﬂavored
ice cubes for a nickel. Since then, I

'have marketed products, and

invested in stocks,” Kramer stated.

However, unlike Kramer, some
students “fell into" their small busi-
ness. Diana Thorton, a senior
archeology major, used to work in
McDonalds. Then her mother lent
her a computer. Today, Diana
works for herself in a typing service
business.

“I’m not making bags of money,
but it does help me finance school.
The advantage of doing work for

yourself is that you don’t have a-

9

boss; only your bills are your boss,’
Thorton said. “I didn’t anticipate-the
number of people who needed typ-
ing done. It really was a surprise.”

Both Thorton and Kramer admit
that money is the primary motiva-
tion. “I know I'm ambitious. My
goal is to make $50 million,” stated
Kramer.

Students all over the country like
Kramer are inspired to start their
own businesses because of success
stories of men like Frank Carney,

who as a student at Wichita State
University in 1958 started a pizza
business with his brother. That small
pizza business became Pizza Hut.

Chris Warman, 24, the owner of
Goodies in Oakland and one in Cape
Cod, also believes in the “American
Dream." “I'm not a follower. I’m a
high achiever who will do whatever
it takes,” Warman said.

Warman was recruited to Pitt to
play football. Two years ago, he
took time off from school because he
was “bored and wanted‘ to start
something on [his] own.”

“I have learned more about busi-
ness since I started Goodies than ifl
stayed in school. In fact, I’lI die
before I’ll fail,” stated Warman.

Failure is the entreprenueurs
nightmare.

“The most important thing to do
to avoid failure is to get rid of your
idiosyncracies, such as thinking
you’re so hot because you own your
own business. You really have to
find your weaknesses and improve
your strengths,” Warman said.

idea, you must turn that energy into
systematic analysis. You have to
take a step back for evaluation.

To help the student entrepreneur
avoid failure, ACE offers advice to
the student entrepreneur. David
Castaldo, director of the Advanced
Technology Entrepreneurial Center
and owner of his own software com-
pany, collaborated with Schwab to
start an ACE program here at Pitt.

ACE offers forums and speakers
from the local businesses. The asso-
ciation also has group discussions
about the problems such as com-
munity responsibility confronting
student entrepreneurs. All is open to
students, faculty or staff.

“We get together and toss ideas
around. If anyone is having a prob-
lem or an idea, we discuss what is
wrong with it and what is right so
that the entrepreneur can refine his
idea or confront his problem,”
explained Castaldo.

“You have to give any business a
chance; Endurance is important.
You can’t expect success overnight-.
That does happen but it’s not the
rule,” said Castaldo.

Repeat Performance

Any time there is a change in the leadership ofa major world
power, the manner in which other nations view that nation
changes in some way. In 1980, American hostages held in Iran
for more than a year were released on the eve of Reagan’s
assumption of the office of the president. Although it is possi-
ble that the release was the result of many hours of hard work
put in by President Carter, it is more likely that the release came
about as a result of the change in leadership and the consequen-

ces of that change.

Given the recent change in power in the Soviet Union, our‘
nation has been given the opportunity to open the doors of
diplomacy and to pursue with new optimism the goal of world
peace. As he elected to do 13 months ago upon thedeath of
Chernenko’s predecessor, Yuri Andropov, President Reagan
again chose to send Vice President George Bush as this coun-
try’s_ emissary to the Soviet’s state funeral.

Granted, the government of the Soviet Union made no mis-
take about its desire to promote a smooth transition of power
with the swearing in of Mikhail Gorbachev only a few hours
after the announcement of former President Chernenko’s
death. But this did not limit the Reagan administration in terms
of "a quick and open response. Unfortunately, that response

never came about.

President Reagan determined earlier this week that there was
too much for him to do at this time, and that he “didn’t think
much could be achieved by going [to Chernenko's funeral].”
The events that Reagan deemed too important to postpone
were a meeting early this week with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and another meeting this Sunday and Monday with
Canadian Prime Minister Brian_ Mulroney. Surely these two
leaders would understand the importance of open diplomacy
with the Soviet Union and not be so offended at a delay in their
respective meetings with Reagan.

Thus far, the only attempt that Reagan has personally made
with Gorbachev is a letter in which White House officials say he
“broached the subject of a summit,” preferably here in the

United States.

The president has said that he is seeking a meeting with a
“legitimate agenda” and not just a meeting in which the two
leaders would “get acquainted.” The error in this type of think-
ing is that it would simply be foolish to ignore the opportunity
to speak with the new Soviet leader on any terms, even ifit were
only to become acquainted. It is very doubtful that either the
Soviet Union or this country would allow its leaders to make
any final decisions in terms of peace initiatives anyhow.

Given the gravity of the situation, we believe that anything
Reagan might have had on his schedule could not match the
need for immediate dialogue with the Soviets. In failing to
pursue that sort of dialogue with the new Russian leader, the
Reagan administration has passed up a ‘rare chance for pro-
gress. We hope that this will not be the standard in future

dealings with Gorbachev.

Letters to the Editor

,More on
Farrakhan

In deference to both Mr. Grayson
and Mr. Eisenstat, I do not wish to
address the issue of anti-Semitism
and Farrakhan to campus. As a stu-
dent at this university, I do, how-
ever, wish to protest, the use of
student activity fees, to which I've
contributed, to fund the appearance
of an avowed anti-Semite.

Tamara Deutsch
Pitt Hillel Club

The Black Action Society intends
to invite Rev. Louis Farrakhan of
the Nation of Islam to speak at the
University of Pittsburgh during
Black Week ’85. Because of this
intention, the BAS has been con-
demned by certain sectors of the
Jewish student body at Pitt. Yet for
all the condemnations, we offer no
apologies for attempting to bring
Farrakhan to our university.

Louis Farrakhan is the most con-
troversial man in America. For this
reason, he is deeply loved by some
and vehemently hated" by others.
Only the uninformed members of
our society can ‘beapathetic about
the man. Yet for all the controversy
surrounding Louis Farrakhan and
his statements, very little is known
about the man, the Nation of Islam
or the Black Nationalist tradition
that spawned them both. V

This lack of knowledge pertaining
to him is acutely evident among his
detractors. When asked why they
oppose Farrakhan, _
opponents will rattle off a series of
isolated statements attributed to
him. At the end of the Farrakhan
quotes is usually attached the asser-
tiori that he is anti-Semitic. Unfortu-
nately for all concerned, his
detractors can go no further than
those isolated statements that
they've heard or read in the news
media.

By inviting Louis Farrakhan to
speak at the University of Pitts-
burgh, the Black Action Society is
-affording black students, as well as
the Pittsburgh community at large,
the golden opportunity to gain first-
hand knowledge of what Farrakhan
stands for and represents. Only
someone who is culturally arrogant
and historically ignorant can argue
that “no purpose could possibly be
served by giving him [Farrakhan] a
platform at Pitt  other than the
propagation of hate.“ The above
quotation is the position taken by
Zachary L. Grayson, the past presi-
dent of Masada’, is his March ll let-

0170*

By inviting Louis Farrakhan to
speak at Pitt during Black Week ’85,
the Black Action Society intends to
enrich the cultural and educational
environment of our university. The
BAS never intended to offend any
sector of the Pittsburgh community.
However, the members of the Black
Action Society do not live in a
vacuum. We are fully aware of Far-
rakhan’s villainous image within the
Jewish community. We are equally
aware of the general public’s paucity
of knowledge concerning him. It is
this dearth, or lack of knowledge,
that the Black Action Society is
committed to eradicating.

In response to Mr. Zachary Gray-
son’s letter of March II, I would like
to agree that the situation in South
Africa is not just a black American
issue but is also of concern to all
human beings who believe in equal-
ity and the dignity of man. I do not
believe, however, that allowing the
Rev. Farrakhan to speak at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh is anti-Semitic
(or more correctly, anti-Jewish,
since Arabs are also Semitic peoples
whose religion is either Moslem or
Christian). When the Rabbi Myer
Kahane, who advocates the forced
expulsion of Arabs from the Occu-
pied Territories a_nd promotes strife
and vigilante-ism, was hosted at
local Jewish synogagues, no one cri-
ticized the sponsors of this speaking
tour of rabid anti-Arabism, preju-
dice or of being warmongers, etc.

Additionally, while the plight of
Soviet Jewry is a human rights issue,
so is the plight of thousands and
thousands of Palestinian Arab
women, children _and other civilians
who are not the minority of people
who oppose Israeli occupation and
usurpation of their rights and prop-
erty with physical violence and ter-
rorism. And yet it is Israel who is the
staunchest ally of South Africa,
supplying arms and expertise in
guerrilla warfare and occupation
techniques, and support for South
Africa in the United Nations.

The recent Israeli attacks upon
villages in South Lebanon have
again raised the stakes for the Unit-
ed States and the moderate Arab
states in the region. The results of
the buildup of Shiite Moslem hatred
of Israel have profound and debili-
tating consequences for the United
States. Because of our veto in the
United Nations and our massive mil-
itary and economic aid tolsrael (.at a

esoseoeeoséoeesesasooocctafaosaoorscsvossoqggu

.ne when money for educational

enefits, aid to farmers and other
irograms designed to aid Americans
IS being greatly reduced), the U.S. is
considered a full partner in Israeli
actions in Lebanon and elsewhere in
the Middle East.

Enraged Shiites in the oil-rich gulf
states of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates
and Iraq may force these states into
a decision consisting of either civil
war or anti-American policies. The
only beneficiaries of this disruption
of vital and pro-western states will
be the Soviet Union and Israel,
which considers U.S. ties to Arab
countries as a rivalry to its stated
position as the only pro-American
state in the Middle East. '

The dangers of Israeli policy and
the implications for the United
States are too clear to ignore -— the
-United States could lose the entire
region to Soviet influence if we are
not careful to state that we do not
approve of the massacre of civilians
-— either in Lebanon, Jordan or the
occupied territories.

In response to Zachary L. Gray-
son’s letter (“Lend Your Voice,”
March 11), we are insulted by your
assumption that these “powers that
be,” as you posit, are not outraged
by the Black Action Society’s
attempt to bring Louis Farrakhan to
Pitt and your insinuation that “quiet
diplomacy” is merely a conspiracy to
prevent students from being active
in the fight against racism and anti-
Semitism.

As active Jewish students of this
university, we are deeply concerned
with facilitating friendly and coop-
erative relations with the various
student groups. We feel that an
exchange of ideas between all parties
to a controversy is the first priority
when searching for a mutually
acceptable solution. Protest should
be utilized only after all other
responsible efforts have been
exhausted.

Because Louis Farrakhan is a
highly controversial figure, those of
us who were informed about the
plan to give Mr. Farrakhan a
podium on this campus agreed that
“quiet diplomacy" in this case was
the most reasonable starting point.
A meeting was subsequently
arranged between a number of
active Jewish students and represen-
tatives of the Black Action Society
in order to discuss and resolve the
situation.

We agree with Mr. Grayson’s con-

rejection of “quiet diplomacy." The

ing between human beings is

through open communication.

In my five years at the University
of Pittsburgh, I've never felt as com-
pelled to write a letter as I do now!

This letter is in response to
Camille White’s and Adam Eisen-
stat’s letters in the March I3 issue of
The Pitt News.

Camille White claimed that we
should not blindly condemn some-
body without hearing what they
have to say. I couldn't agree more
with her! Let’s take a. look at what
Louis Farrakhan has to say. In a
radio broadcast, he called Judaism
the “gutter religion.” In other
speeches and articles, he referred to
Adolph Hitler as a “great man” and
Khadafy as a “nice guy.” We know
what it is that Farrakhan has to say.

I turn my attention to Adam
Eisenstat. He claimed that when
Farrakhan_speaks, he combats anti-
Semitism by allowing us to hear his
racist vitriol. How many times do we
have to listen to it before we under-
stand what is being said? By using
Eisenstat’s logic, I conclude that he
would have argued to bring Hitler
on campus because reading “Mein
Kampf” would not be sufficient to
see what Farrakhan had to say. I
think it is Eisenstat who is not recog-
nizing the seriousness of the matter,
and I ask him a simple question:
Would you rather argue in defense
of listening to somebody call you a
person from the gutter or would you
rather use your freedom of speech to
make people aware of the anti-
Semitism and racism that the
speaker possesses?

The other day, our Econ 11 class
got back an examination. Every-
thing was seemingly routine, except
for the last question. Based upon a
given paragraph, we had to decide
whether Mondale or Vice President
Bush was speaking correctly, in
terms of economic principles. In
explaining the exam, our instructor
said that Mondale had been correct
in that particular circumstance. He
rather insightfully added in jest:
“Yes, Mondale was right, even
though many of you may not like to

hear it." At that instant the majority
of the class chuckled; a few members
outright laughed.

The class’ response lasted but a
few seconds and was seemingly of no
significance whatsoever. To me,
however, the laughter was of pro-
found importance. It suggested to
me the metamorphosis the nation
has undergone in the last few years.
College students, and college stu-
dents at the University of Pittsburgh
no less, an institution that has
always been on the liberal side of the
American political spectrum, were
not only rejecting liberalism, but
they were belittling it.

If one had predicted I5 years ago
or, for that matter, seven or eight
years ago, that college kids would
someday scorn the ideals of Hubert
Humphrey’s protege, he would have
been rendered insane. If one had
prophesized in 1970 or 1975 that
hundreds of young people would be
on their feet screaming at the 1984
Republican National Convention to
re-elect a 73-year-old conservative,
he would have lost all credibjlity.
Nevertheless, on both counts, such a
prophet would have been right.

The fact is, Ronald Reagan has
done far more than boost the econ-
omy, resurrect the military or even
revive patriotism. He has instilled in
the minds of ‘a new generation the
values of conservativism. America's
young people no longer live in the
world of illusion —— the world of
riots, drugs, meaningless liberal
idealism and constant tension is
thing of the past. Thanks to Presi-
dent Reagan, we are truly a new gen-
eration of Americans, one that has
in itself the power to begin the world

over again.

Power forgotten

What ever happed to good, old-
fashioned protest? During the ’60s,
many students from colleges and
universities across the country stood
up (or sometimes sat down) for what
they felt was right. What happened?

With the recently proposed tui-
tion increases at the University of
Pittsburgh and the government’s
threat of reducing loan and grant
availability, I expected — even
anticipated — student protest and
dissent. Yet at this university and
others, the powers of protest seem to
have been forgotten.

I am only one person. The echoes
of my protest fill the quads, the
cafeteria and the entire university. I
call on the student government and
the student body to make an organ-
ized effort to let the voice of the
students be heard. If no action is
taken soon, some of us may not be
here to defend ourselves next year.

Jim Brueckner penned an article
in the March 13 issue of The Pitt
News entitled “Student-athlete: It's
not as simple as it seems.” I happen
to believe that it’s much simpler than
he thinks it is.

I, too, agree that a university is
first and foremost a learning institu-
tion before it is an “athletic factory.”
In fact, I believe that this university
is a lot of things before it is an
athletic factory. Furthermore, it is
unfortunate that in most sports, the
only channel an athlete can take
toward a professional career is
through college; there should be
other alternatives. And yes, he’s
absolutely right: We’ll never hear
“Superbrain Jones will be barred
from the classroom next semester
because of his 48-percent free throw
average” on the news.

And there is the bone to pick: his
double-standard argument that
“nerds, wimps and geeks” are
allowed greater opportunities and
liberties than are athletes. He
implies that when athletes go to col-
lege, they are not treated like human
beings, nor are they given a fair shot.
And there’s no way that this kind of
prejudice —— where “a law student
must meet no athletic standards to
forward his career, but an athlete

This letter is in response to Marie
Evans’ letter on March 11. The
“advertisement / article" she refers to
was not written by an SGB member
but by the newly reformed Student
Relations Committee.

The SRC exists to serve as public
relations for the Student Govern-
ment Board and its standing com-
mittees. As a former member, I
know that this can sometimes be dif-
ficult when, (l) you’re a freshmen;
(2) board members are too busy to
sit and chat for a decent article to be
written; and (3) you’re starting a
committee from scratch and have no
previous members to look for
guidance.

Give the Student Relations Com-
mittee a chance. With the coopera-
tion of the board and fellow
students, SRC will be able to
proudly present student government
to the students.

He asked why there was a double
standard for two areas that he thinks
are unrelated. Although he certainly
understands what double standard
means, he doesn’t.seem to realize
that this prejudice he’s seeking to
justify doesn’t exist. The double
standard he claims doesn’t apply not
because athletics and academics are
unrelated, but because sports are
extra-curricular to academics.

That relationship is what he over-
looked in his midweek commentary.
Athletics doesn’t get equal footing
with academics. Participating .in
sports is something extra, something
additional, something beyond what
is usual or expected. A college stu-
dent can always choose to partici-
pate in a sport, but a college athlete
cannot elect to “participate"in a uni-
versity class. One is voluntary; the
other is mandatory. If these areas
were regarded as equal priorities of a
university, then we’d all be student-
ath1etes.,However, it isn't that way;
as we’ve already agreed, the univer-
sity is primarily a learning
institution.

Of course, everyone has the right
to pursue the career of his choice.

the person from responsibilities and
expectations seemingly unrelated to
that career. In fact, the choice to
pursue a goal is also a choice to
accept those responsibilities and
expectations.

Giving student-athletes a free ride
on the coattails of “receipts and TV
money” profits simply teaches them
to keep riding piggyback, just as
they have throughout their school-
ing. Although some athletes who
“can't cut it in the classroom” may
be products of inefficient education
systems, others are totally responsi-
ble for their ignorance and illiteracy.
It isn’t that they can‘t cut it — they
won't.

As I’ve said, it’s too bad that col-
leges and universities are the only
route for athletes to reach profes-
sional status. There's a lot of poten-
tial lost once aspiring athletes are
weeded out because they can’t afford
to pay tuition costs. But I don’t agree
that improving athletes’ opportuni-
ties should call for changing the uni-
versity’s inherent purpose.

The solution shouldn’t restructure
the purposes and goals ofthe univer-
sity. Instead, other avenues outside
the university that can lead aspiring
athletes to a professionalcareer need
to be explored.

therapy followed the segmental mas-
tectomy in order to treat skin, breast
tissue, muscle, lymphatics and entire
scarring of the breast. Radiation
inhibits the recurrence of another
breast tumor. The amount of radia-
tion administered is usually 5,000-
5,300 rads. “These are not surgical
or radiation studies, these are bio-
logical studies for cancer in general,
not just breast," said Fisher.

1n the way of figures, 72.1 percent
of those treated by segmental mas-
tectomy without radiation have
remained tumor-free in that breast.
Ten years ago, radical mastectomy
was performed on 100 percent of
patients with breast tumors; now it is
done in only two to four percent of
cases. There have been 3,928
patients who have consented to be
included in the study, and follow-
ups of many of these patients are
conducted about every nine months.
Of the patients receiving radiation,
92.3 percent remained tumor-free
after five years, compared to 72.1
percent of those not receiving
radiation.

“We believe in our results and we
believe they are solid,” said Fisher.

Williams, equally recruited as a
standout basketball player at Free-
dom Area High School, followed in
his brother Chuck's footsteps to
Pitt. Neither had a chance to play in
their freshman years as the red-
shirted Chuck, a defensive tackle,
was hindered by knee problems sim-
ilar to his brother’s. As a senior aver-
aging 21 points per game, Tony
Williams left Freedom as its all-time
leading scorer. That same season
(1983), he caught 35 passes for 561
yards.

The student involved in the earlier
incident with Heyward, sophomore
Matthew Black, plans to withdraw
from Pitt. Contrary to earlier indica-
tions, however, he said his exit is due
only in part to the incident.

“I'm not leaving specifically due
to that incident. l’ve been disillu-
sioned with the University of Pitts-
burgh for over a year and a half. It‘s
pretty apathetic here."

Black, who also said he suffered a
one-inch deep facial gash below his
eye that required 40 stitches to close,
contends that he'll leave for at least a
year “to get my life in order.” A reli-
gious studies major, Black added,
“l’ve suffered a lot of emotional and
physical trauma, but that’s not the
whole reason l‘m leaving." Black
said it might be at least nine more
months before doctors determine
whether plastic surgery would be
necessary to cosmetically repair a
scar he said has formed.

Ladyhawke brings a medieval legend to life

by Scott D. Rosenberg

Enter the walled city of Aquila
with its ramparts, cobbled streets,
thick-set stone houses, markets,
moat, palace and majestic cathedral.
With all these are the enchanting
times of the medieval period tucked
neatly together to provide the setting
of Ladyhawke.

Adventure and plenty of drama

abound from the start as we follow‘

quickly falls on the wrong ears.
Recaptured and moments away from
execution, he is spared by the myste-
rious appearance of a knight in black
armor who succeeds in freeing Phil-
lipe, taking him away.on horseback.
Riding with the knight is Navarre
(Rutger Hauer), the knight’s con-
stant companion.

By nightfall, Phillipe learns of a
strange and frightening occurrence:
The knight changes into a prowling

»wolf, and his companion hawk trans-

forms into a bewitched maiden. At
daybreak, Navarre explains to Phil-
lipe that a spell was cast upon them by
the demonic Bishop of Aquila, who,
spurned of his own passion for the

‘maiden Isabeau of Anjou (Michelle

Pfeiffer), curses the two lovers to be
”always together, yet eternally apart.
She was to be a hawk by day and he a
wolf by night.”

Navarre isn't interested that his
newly found companion is on ”speak-
ing terms” with God. The larger fact
is that for two years, Navarre has
sought entrance into Aquila to take
the Bishop by surprise and carry out
his well—deserved revenge.

The Aquila prisons were notor-
iously inescapable, at least until ”Phil—
lipe the Mouse” proved it wasn't.
Navarre shrewdly deduced that if
"the mouse” can escape, -the mouse
can re-enter. ‘By sheer intimidation,
he persuades Phillipe to undertake

the mission.

The two characters provide a star-
tling contrast, with I-Iauer's icy arro-
gance and ruthless manner playing
off of the happy-go—lucky antics of
Broderick. Broderick’s choice is
essentially made for him.

Ladyhawlce is action-packed and
adventuresome, with appealing
aspects American audiences can gen-
erally agree upon: the machismo of
the handsome blond hero driven to
succeed for his own cause, a beautiful
heroine, a lighthearted tag-along,
romantic pursuit and rich settings
chock-full of scenic effects to fulfill
the escapist in all of us. And with a
hero comes a villain — ironically a
man of the church, an evil and cor-
rupt bishop. Poetic justice prevails,
and through a fine climactic buildup,
the film demands applause.

Fine performances are turned in by
the entire cast, but Rutger Hauer
deserves special mention for his por-
trayal of Navarre. Hauer, perhaps
best remembered for bad-guy roles in
”Nighthawks” and ”Blade Runner,” is
menacing, with an Aryan look and
disposition and makes good use of
these characteristics in Ladyhawke.

Filmed in Italy and adapted from a
legend originating in the 13th cen-
tury, Ladyhawke offers adventure, sus-
pense and convincing characters
along the way to creating an exciting,
worthwhile film.

Richard Thompson's Across a Crowded Room

Drawing

ACROSS A CROWDED
ROOM

Richard Thompson

Polydor

As the ‘founder of Britain's
legendary folk-rock band Fair-
port Convention, Richard
Thompson has established —
both with that band and on his
own —— a string of critically
acclaimed albums that few
artists have equalled. His collab-
orations with his wife Linda
have earned unanimous kudos
from the music press with
1982's Shoot Out the Lights making
a number of year-end 10 Best
lists, including those of The Vil-
lage Voice and Rolling Stone.

Thompson's life, however,
has since taken a number of dra-
matic turns. A split with Linda
and a recent jump to a major
label have undoubtedly affected
Richard Thompson personally
as well as artistically. As one
might expect, these change-
have created an atmosphere for
Across a Crowded Room that is a
subtle departure from his pre-
vious work, which was more
strictly influenced by folk and
traditional styles.

NORMAN NARDINI AND’
THE TIGERS

Norman Nardini and the Tigers
CBS Associated Labels

For Pittsburgh's rock main-
stay Norman Nardini, this
recent excursion into the
national arena is the culmina-
tion of years of hard work. In
essence, it is the Swissvale

from the well f exp

With an elegant string of
songs, this album projects itself
like a moving docudrama of the
tribulations of a humble life, a
life that Thompson has always
embraced, raising it to poetic
beauty. "When the Spell is

Broken” echoes with the anx-
iety of romantic discord, its
somber, ruminating style
reminiscent of Lindsay. Buck-
ingham. The crackling guitar
leads provide the song with its
emotional release. The cranking

enence

straightforwardness of ”Fire in
the Engine Room” and the back-

porch easiness of ”You Don't‘

Say” illustrate the overall
moodiness of the record. ”Love
in a Faithless Country” dives
forcefully into the spiritual
squalor at the base of this pro-
ject, like the cripple warning the
king of the inevitable down-
swing of the high ride. Learn the
way to melt into a crowd/Never catch
an eye or dress too loud/You ’ve got to be
invisible, my friend/To find the joy on
which we must depend.

Though the album is an
impressive mixture of songs
from the heart and gold star
musicianship, Thompson seems
unsure as to the album's intent,
undoubtedly having to make it
more accessible this time
around for his new label. The
material is certainly drawn from
the same Celtic wellspring that
nurtured past projects, but the
production seems to be aimed at
enticing the listener into giving
Richard Thompson a chance,
moreover, to buy Richard
Thompson.

There is no need for come-
ons. The spirit speaks for itself.

native’s dream come true.
Unfortunately, just as dreaming
is more often than not linked to
sleeping, so falls this album into
slumberland. ’

Of the 10 tracks, only two are
genuine attention grabbers.
The album's initial single, ”If
You Don't Want Me," which is
Nardini’s rock ’n’ roll paean to
self-esteem, sports a delightful
throwaway, pop-tune quality
and enough energy to get the lp
moving. However, with the
exception of the acoustic ballad
”Anything You Do is Alright,”
the rest of the album moves like
a car with its emergency brake
still cocked.

”Loverman” begs similarities
to Talking Heads with its chink-
ing, semi-muted guitar work
and backing vocals but winds up

being more of a garage band
imitation. The material on side
two is so weak that it may as
well be one long outgroove.
”Girls All Around The World,”
with its earthy feel and guttural
vocals, could have been done by
Joe Ely. Unfortunately, the
resemblance is only one in pass-
ing. In addition, an uninspired
cover of The Shondells’ ”I Think
We're Alone Now” paints the
album in a stale color — a dirty
beige —— that tends to over-
shadow the portions of the
album‘ that are generally well
done. I

The biggest problem is that

this album lacks the urgency\

and individual color that are
needed to propel a debut. If Nor--
man is indeed clawing his way
into the unpredictable world of

FIRE ME UP
Roman Holliday
Arista

If I were a 13-year-old girl
with a subscription to Tiger Beat,
listening to Fire Me Up would be
an intensely moving experience.
Alone in my bedroom, I would
gaze at my Roman Holliday pos-
ter and pretend that such lyrics

.THE DEL LORDS
The Decade
March 10, 1985

by Michael Selz

The Del Lords fit very neatly into
the most recent wave of new. music.
Variously called American music,
twang and thump or, more literally,
country punk, bands like The Del
Lords, The Long Ryders, Rubber
Rodeo, Los Lobos and Lone Justice
borrow liberally from America's

   

DLCSGDTSI .

Annual   Commencement

   
 
   
  

country and folk tradition (or Tex-
Mex, in the case of Los Lobos) and
inject it with some of the punch and
vitality of new wave. Clean produc-
tion, meticulous engineering and
mixing the drums way up front are
ways that these idioms have been
updated.

I don't want to contradict myself,
but The Del Lords work even better

in the tapestry—swathed Decade than _

they do on vinyl. Their show Sunday
night was a foot-stompin’ good time.
The record's OK, but it doesn't indi-
cate what fun this band can be.

No keyboards cluttered the stage
— just three mike stands and a drum
kit. Tearing into the first song, ”True
Love,” the two guitarists, bass player
and drummer took turns singing,
making you think of The Byrds or

The Flying Burrito Brothers. With

the second song, a twanger called
”Pledge of Love,” the bass player took
lead vocals, sounding like Roger
McGuinn. A dirty slide guitar solo
embellished this one, and the room —
respectably filled up for a Sunday

* night — was won.

me of Creedence, and John Fogerty
would probably be proud to have
these fellows back him up.

Later on, these originals were suc-
ceeded by what might be called hom-

this portion of the show, The Del

Room Service offers a limited menu

by Michael Selz

At one point in the Pittsburgh
Public Theater's production of the
1930's classic Room Service, the director
wakes up from a dream with a vision
of a new kind of theater, Of "a stage
without actors, a theater without an
audience, just scenery and critics.”

Although this play isn't bad, it does
hobble a little. You can make two dif-
ferent mistakes when staging a ”clas-
sic.” One is that if you try to update
or’ transform it, you can murder an
already proven formula for success.
The other is that if you are so faithful
to the original that you become com-
placent, a bubbling, lively drama can
become as likable as a three—day-old
glass of Coca-Cola.

Basically, the story is of would-be
Broadway producer Gordon Miller
(Don Howard) with a sure hit on his
hands. He puts up his actors, director,
playwright and stage manager in the

‘ White Way Hotel — feeding, lodging

and rehearsing them there, using its
resources and escalating the bill
indulged by the hotel's manager, his
brother-in-law (Alan Sues). When an
ambitious supervisor (Patrick
Farrely) comes in to improve profita-
bility of the establishment, he is a-
ghast at what he finds. And that's

when the fun starts.

The. problem with Room Service can
be summed up in a word: pacing. The
play works in its written form
because it's a frantic, kinetic comedy.
It abounds in wordplay and sight gags
and exploits the Great American
Love of the Con Artist. It has to move
fast, never letting you recover from
one stitch before sending you into
your next set. This production, how-
ever, only does this some of the time.

There also were inconsistencies.
Claire Beckman ,(as Hilda Manney,
the hotel secretary) had remarkable
timing for a newcomer, but her
Brooklyn accent occasionally disap-
peared entirely. ‘Alan Sues is a comic
professional, but instead of showing
difficulty getting an enormous bunch
of bananas through a door, he
showed difficulty getting through
the gag. In a number of almost-funny
instances, you know you're supposed
to laugh. Instead, you feel short-
changed, like you have to meet them
halfway.

To its credit, when this play
worked, it really worked. When Miller
puts all the clothes he owns on him-
self and his colleagues in order to
leave the hotel unobtrusively and
skip out on the bill, he looks like big-
suited David Byrne in Stop Making
Sense.

Alan Sues, from the 19605 TV

 

show Laugh-ln, clicked into his charac-
ter after the first act and revealed the
good reason for casting him. He
seems to have explored every angle of
the word ”distraught" and has a
brimming arsenal of voices and man-
nerisms to take his character to hilar-
ious extremes. The director, played
by eight—time Broadway veteran

-Michael Lipton, is not the center of

the play, but he's onstage almost the
whole time and was easily the most
consistently enjoyable. His timing
was flawless, and the wry expressive-

ness of his voice suited the role to a T.
For a brief time, Allan Pinsker stole
the show as a Russian waiter and
expatriate actor who gives away food
to the starving troupe to buy an audi-
tion for their show.

It's worth noting that the overall
pacing picked up as the play went on.
On the whole, the performance was
an enjoyable experience. But a pro-
duction like this has to run like
greased lightning, and the Public’s
Room Service was a little late and a little

_ paltry.

John Scherer, Allan Pinsker, Don Howard and Michael Lipton star in Room

Service.

Pitt decked by Louisiana Tech 78-54

By Bob Travers I
The Pitt News

TULSA, Okla. —— The experts
said playing in the Big East confer-
ence was an advantage. They said
going 8-8 in the Big East was like
winning a lesser conference, and
they said there wasn’t a Big East
team in the NCAA tournament who
should have had trouble with a team
from one of those “wimpy”
conferences.

Well, they were wrong. .

Pitt came out ﬂatter than th
Oklahoma landscape yesterday

afternoon, losing to Southland Con-.

ference champion Louisiana Tech
78-54.

“The game was over early,” head
coach Roy Chipman said. “They
totally outplayed us in the first 3-4
minutes. We just couldn’t put the
ball in the basket and they played
tough defense.” \

A lot of times, Pitt couldn’t put
the ball even close to the basket.
They shot a horrendous 35.5 percent
from the floor and only 66.7 percent
from the line. The Panthers were
stymied from the perimeter and any
time it looked like they had a chance
to go inside, the Tech defense closed
the hole quicker than you could say
“maybe next year."

“We took a lot of shots we proba-

Versatile

By Laurie Kubll
and Mitch Vingle
The Pitt News

Her success as a freshman has
been, to say the least, worthy of a
second glance. Beth Waters, who
racked up a 36.05 inthe all-around
against seventh-ranked Ohio State,
has a fair shot at making the
national gymnastics tournament in
April. In order to do so, Waters will
have to perform well at the Eastern
Regionals.

“Beth has become our most con-
sistent all-around performer,” said
Pitt head coach Donna Sanft. The
coach said that Waters had scored
36 in each of her previous four meets
and had not fallen, either. “For a
freshman, that‘s pretty amazing. We
have high hopes for Beth and we can
count on her to hit. She’s exciting
and dynamic to watch.”

Prior to these competitions, how-
ever, Waters and her teammates face
Penn State —- a team that seldom
lacks talent - tomorrow in the
Lions’ den.

“Everyone looks really strong —
or at least we looked great until the

T injury,” Waters said, alluding to the

fact that Kim Calderone is on
crutches with a sprained ankle, and
it looks doubtful she will compete.

If Calderone does not compete,
she will be missed. However, Waters
hinted that Penn State may be
forced to perform without an impor-
tant athlete in their lineup, all-

 

qualiﬁers.

Press Box

Magniﬁcent 7?

Three women and four men from .Pitt’s
diving team head to Harvard for the pre-

bly shouldn’t have taken, and then I
think we got a little tentative,” Chip-
man said. lntimidated would proba-
bly be a better word. With Tech big
men Karl “Mailman" Malone and
Willy Simmons playing like a
quieter version of Kentucky’s famed
twin towers defense of Sam Bowie
and Mel Perkins, Pitt found itself in
a bit of an offensive quandary.
For the entire Pitt team, the game
seemed a microcosm of what has
ailed them all year. Along with poor
shooting, the Panthers’ troubles at
center continued. Using no fewer
than four people in the middle —
Andre Williams, Charles Smith,
Keith Armstrong and Matt Miklase-
vich —— they combined for a total of
just 10 points. Take away Smith’s

. output, and the total was one free

throw (by Armstrong).

The four also nabbed a total of
only nine rebounds, with only four
of those coming on the defensive
boards. Tech totally dominated the

,boards, outrebounding Pitt 56-26.

Smith was playing with an injured
foot, which was not revealed ’to
Chipman until 12 minutes remained
in the game. Smith injured the foot
in practice Wednesday and chose to
keep it to himself. Chipman, how-
ever, conceded a sore foot was no
explanation for the poor play of the
Panthers.

“That’s no excuse,” Chipman
said, “Tech is a very good team.” ‘

Indeed they are. They put the

Panthers on the ropes early, going
up 9-2 four minutes into the game.
Capitalizing on Pitt’s terrible shoot-
ing and frequent early turnovers, the
Bulldogs built up such a wide mar-
gin that Pitt could only chisel at it,
never coming close to knocking it
down.

“I felt it was a very typical game

for us,” said Tech coach Andy Russo ,

of the one-sided contest. “We always
have a few players who do well for
us. At different times, different play-
ers rise to the occasion.”

Rising highest for the Bulldogs
yesterday were junior sixth man
Willie Bland, who scored 16 coming
off the bench, and starting forward
Robert Godbolt, who pumped in a
game-high 17. “We weren’t expect-
ing to win," Godbolt said.

In the end, it wasn’t so much the
offense but Tech’s stingy defense
and experience that was Pitt‘s unra-
veling. “Our defense kept us in the
game and gave us the lead at the
half," - Russo said. “We have the

utmost respect for them. lt’s obvious .

Pitt has good, young players and
they will be a force to reckon with.
Right now,-I think it was our expe-
rience that made the difference.”

Tech will play Ohio State on Sat-
urday in Tulsa, as the Buckeyes
downed Iowa State 75-64 yesterday.

The versatile performer has a new

‘‘It’s kind of shaky but ifl do them in

As for making the NCAAs,
Waters is cautiously optimistic. “I’d

afternoon's action.

Fellow Panther John Hnath
(I26 lbs.) defeated Cliff Gosse of
Fresno State 8-5 in a match that
determined who would compete
in the first round. Hnath subse-
quently lost to No. 12 seed
Anthony Amado of Portland
State 5-4 in overtime after reach-
ing a 14-14 tie in regulation time.

Bolin earned his ranking by
winning the Eastern Wrestling

received a wild-card spot when
he finished third in his weight
class two weekends ago at the

The Pitti'News, Friday, March 15, 1985

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

Pitt will be represented by three
women and four men divers at Har-
vard this weekend for the NCAA

-Prequalifying Diving Meet.

According to diving coach Julian
Krug, the prequalifiers are designed
to provide a more objective basis
with which tojudge divers‘ qualifica-
tions for the national championship
which will be held March 2l-23 in
Alabama.

The women diving for Pitt include
juniors Jennifer Brown, and Tricia
Shultz and sophomore Tricia Ney.

Brown was named most outstand-
ing diver two weeks ago when Pitt
hosted the Big East Championship.
According to Brown, the Big East
was a good transition for the divers
after the dual meet season: “Before
the Big East, we hadn’t had that
much exposure to dive meets like the
prequalifiers.”

Shultz, who was the 1984 Big East

0 Outstanding Female Diver, was the

1984 conference champion on the
three-meter board. This is the
second consecutive year she has
qualified for NCAA prequalifiers at
both heights.

Ney has had a successful season
and hopes to continue her momen-
tum into the national championship.
According to Ney, she would like to
qualify for the Olympic trials if she
makes it to nationals.

The men’s team has barely had
time to take a breath as they travel to
Harvard this weekend after taking
the Eastern title this past weekend at
Cleveland State. ‘

The four divers representing the
men arcjuniors Todd Mulzet, Mark
McCormick and Mike McCalley,
and sophomore Jack Shuten.

Pair of “Willies” lead Tech over Panthers

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

. TULSA, OKLA. -— They are eas-
ily the most overlooked team in the
Top Ten, the Louisiana Tech Bull-
dogs are. And what attention they
did get from the nation’s media
revolved around Karl “the Mail-
man" Malone.

But in yesterday’s 78-54 demoli-

tion of Pitt, “the Mailman” did not
deliver. He only had nine points,
well below his 16.3 ppg season aver-
age, playing just 25 minutes. While
Malone sat, it fell to a couple of guys
named Willie — Bland and Sim-
mons —- to bring the Panthers their
termination notice.
’ In appearance and style they are
as different as their first names are
similar. Bland is a stocky, yet some-
how sleek 6-5, 200 pounds, while
Simmons is a rail thin 6-5.

Bland is Tech’s sixth man, an all-

Malone. “When Karl’s not in there,
the role of the big man falls to
me,”said the soft spoken senior from
New Orleans. Yesterday Simmons
played that role very well. He had l3
points and 10 rebounds against Pitt.
But more important than that was
his presence on the court. Malone
could sit and Tech didn’t miss a beat
with Simmons more than picking up
where “the mailman” left off.

The lack of notoriety Louisiana
Tech is rapidly becoming known for
does not seem to bother Simmons.
“I don’t think about that,” he said.
“Today wasn’t our chance to prove
anything -— wejust wanted the game
for the playoffs.”

bar impersonation. “They are pers-
cription,” Simmons said of his
goggles. “I probably wouldn‘t wear
them ifl didn't have to.“

If Willie Bland didn't have to sit
on the bench every time a Tech game
starts, he probably wouldn’t. But for
now he is content with his role as the
sixth man. “You're supposed to have
a good sixth man, and that’s what I
am,” Bland said. “That I don’t start
doesn’t bother me; I am a role
player. If the coach wants me to
start, l’ll do it. If he wants me as a
sixth man, then l’ll do that. I'll do
anything as long as we win.”

Bland, contrary to his surname, is
the most electrifying player on
Tech’s team. His two dunks in the
Pitt game sparked the Bulldogs dur-
ing two of the few stretches Pitt
resembled a basketball team. When
asked about the flash, the affable
junior smiled and said, “ I’m not
looking for it, it just happens, you
know?”

After_ his second dunk, Bland
appeared to be injured. It required a
Tech trainer to help him to his seat.

After nearly putting a damper on
what was almost a perfect afternoon
for Bulldog fans, he limped to the

Men gymnaststackle No. 2 Lions

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

When head coach Frank.
D’Amico takes his men gymnasts to
University Park this Saturday night,
he may very well be facing his tough-
est meet ever as a coach. The Nittany
Lions are currently tabbed as the
No. 2 team in the nation at the Divi-
sion I level, but D’Amico concen-
trates on setting a point-goal for his
team rather than worrying about
beating an obviously superior
opponent.

“We’re very optimistic at this
point in our season," commented
D’Amico at 'yesterday’s practice.
“We are still striving for the 270-

- point mark. If we don’t get it now,
we'll have to wait till next season
because this is our last meet.”

Even if the Panthers do reach
their goal, the chances of victory are
still very slim. Penn State usually
scores in the high 2705 or low 2805.
In last weekend’s meet with Illinois,
the Lions scored a phenomenal 284
on the road. Furthermore, they did
this without pommel horse specialist
Mario Gonzalez, one of the nation’s
premier gymnasts. His absence
forced Penn State to go with an
eight-man lineup, yet the team

members maintained their usual
high scores.

Nonetheless, the meet should
prove to be one of highest quality. In

rivalry is always high, and Saturday
will prove to be no exception, as
several key matchups indicate.

The first battle will be waged on-

the floor exercise as All-East per-
former Mark Klafter faces Lion

Steve Freidman. Freidman is cur-'

rently the Eastern ﬂoor leader with
an average of 9.77, but Klafter has
not lost in this event so far this year.

“This is definitely going to be an
exciting meet. I started getting
psyched about two weeks ago,"
Klafter said. “There’s no question
that they’re' a tough squad. We just
have to keep consistent and hope-
fully finish the best we can.”

Another important confrontation
will involve the high bar. The tal-
ented Lion duo, Terry Bartlett and
Spider Maxwell, will face off against
Matt Peters, another of Pitt’s All-
East competitors. Bartlett is a
member of England’s Olympic
squad and has also competed at
nationals for the Lions. Although he
competes in the all—around, Peters is
especially strong on the high bar and
defeated Bartlett at last year’s' meet‘
at Trees Hall.

The Panthers will go with the
same lineup they used at their
Slippery Rock meet last weekend,
although a neck injury to sopho-
more Jim Gemelas at the meet
caused a slight scare. Gemelas hurt
his neck on the high bars but will
compete on Saturday. “I know what
I did wrong, and now all I have to do

is correct it,” Gemelas‘ said.

Another gymnast Pitt will rely on
for key points is sophomore Ben
Rovee. Rovee’s effort on rings last
weekend earned him an 8.7 score —
one of his best yet.

“The routine l'1l.use this week will
be slightly different because I‘ve
stepped it up to full difficulty,”
Rovee explained. “It will include
such moves as a hip-swing hand, a
power down front lever, and an inlo-
cate back-up breast L-crossed.”

Besides Pitt.’s All-East duo of
Klafter and Peters, the Panthers will
need a strong performance from
freshman all—arounder Jorge San-
chez. Although his consistency is
strong in most events, quality scores
on rings and pommel horse should
raise his point total even higher.

“Because this is our last meet, we
are going to have to keep our enthu-
siasm and team spirit at a high,” he
said. “My goals right now are for a
270 [team] and a 54 for myself.”
