Hundreds of “Survivor” fans packed
into the Wﬂliarn Pitt Union Assembly

Room last night to hear the story of a blue- ‘

collar truck driver. _ C A
But, it wasn’t just any old trucker. Pitt

_ Program Council presented T CBS
‘ “Survivor”. Susan Hawk to hundreds of

curious fans.
Marc Brasof, Pitt Program Council lec-
ture director, said Hawk was really excited

about talking at Pitt.

“This is her ﬁrst lecture by herself and

she is really prepared,” said Brasof before C

the speech. T ,
Harsh opinions of Hawk ﬂoated

T through the audience before her appearance.

“She seems really cruel and back-stab-
bing,” said PPC member Jason ‘Stanberry.

‘,‘She was vicious with not much class,”
said fellow PPC member Sara Marks,
regarding Hawk’s -behavior on the ﬁnal
episode of “Survivor.’_’

Hawk told a fellow castaway rather

‘ harsh words at the last ‘Tribal Council”

meeting which voted for ﬂue winner of the
$1 million prize. —. H

especially interested in what Hawk had to
say about her ﬁnal speech regarding fellow
cast member Kelly.

“I would like to believe it was spur of
the moment, but I think someone may have
wrote it for her,” Christofes -said.

Clapping and cheering replaced talking
whenthe ﬁghts went down and the opening
sequence of the weekly show played before
the audience on a large white screen. Hawk
took stage as the clip ended, wearing a-furry

‘purple sweater, black ﬂoral skirt and plat-

form black sandals showing shiny silver
“I am just a contestant on a game show.
Andwehadagoodtimewithit, didwe
not?” she asked.
The audience roared.

And she began her story. She grew up‘

with two older brothers, a younger brother

and sister.

—“I grew up in the boon-docks and
played all my life with boys,” Hawk said.
 That is one of the reasons ‘she’, she felt
overly qualiﬁed to be a “Survivor.” .

“I was pretty unsure of what to expect, '

Normally the
Government Board president serves

.a year—long term, beginning in

January. But a referendum Oct. 18

could change the starting time to the

summer term. . _ _ g

The referendum, which could
change the election ‘time for SGB,
was conceived of by the constitu-
tional" review committee
announced at this year’s second
SGB meeting last night. A

L “The referendum will ask stu-
dents if they want to change the
time of the election from November
to April,” said Lee Rutledge, co-
chair of the ‘

.e constitutional review commit-
tee. He added that the referendum
will be advertised over the next few
weeks to encourage ‘awareness
among students.

Essentially, if passed, the refer-
endum will allow SGB to be more
in;line with other student groups,
which typically .change officers at
the end‘ of the spring term. The
slower summer months ‘also allow
SGB and student leaders- to forge

relationships for the next school

year. _ .
_Also at the meeting, N eha Patel,
the co—chair for community rela-

tions, announced that SGB will help

with Pittsburgh Project on Oct.,14.
The project will bring hundreds of
students together to clean up -the
Oakland area and Pittsburgh neigh-
borhoods.

Patel said that last year, over

600 students came out for the event.

The students were placed into
groups of about 20 who were
assigneda general area to clean.
Patel said that her committee con-

tacted radio and television stations

At Friday evening’s
Homecoming events, SGB managed
to register about 30 people to vote.
To further educat_e Pitt students
about the upcoming presidential

. election, SGB’s environmental com-
mittee will be providing information‘ ‘
about each candidate’s. stance

environmental issues.
A student attending the meeting

last night voiced his displeasure to

the audience of about 30 of the situ-
ation after Saturday’s football game

A at Three Rivers Stadium.

“There was an unsafe situation
at the footbridge leaving the stadi-
um,” said Mike Guss. “People were
coming. from two different direc-
tions and running into each other.”

Guss urged ‘SGB to ask Pitt to
add police to help along the throngs
of people leaving the stadium.

“After the meeting before the

first football game, we haven’t
talked with athletics,” said SGB
President Joan Snyder. “We want to

She added that athletics liaison John

Voinski will be talking to ‘Pitt to‘
ensure fans are satisfied_ for the rest

of the season.

Although the rivalry between»

Pitt and Penn State brought out
thousands of students, Snyder hopes
that the large crowds will continue.

- “I just hope that people see ‘how
much fun it was-to tailgate before

the game at the stadium--We’re,
- going to try to make sure that we

plan more events to get students to

China Sea and the new television show
while driving her rigger one moming and
decided to apply to bea contestant. She had
been trying to ﬁnd a new job that paid by the
hour for more than a year. I

“I thought, ‘Oh my god, I can do that. I
can survive in the bush.”’

She ﬁlled out the three-page applica-
tion and had her husband, who writes songs,
compose a poem for herto say in her video.
Her favorite part of the song went, “If you
fail it’s only your fault, a survivor is not
born, a survivor is made.” ’ .

And with these words, she made the
ﬁrst cut. ‘ '

“I thought, this is a nice dream, but it
isn’t gomia happen,” she said. A .

But it did, she made it down to the las
22. She was told to pack one nice outﬁt and
ﬂy to CBS in Los Angeles. Here she went
through one day of psychological tests and

_ challenging physical tests. 

On the day of her ﬁnal interview ‘she
wore farmer bib shorts to show off her L.A.
tan She thought she was getting a tour of
CBS studios. _ _

“They all [the other contestants] had on
good clothes. And I was like  ‘this is why
I’m supposed to have good clothes.”’

Then, she was led into a big ‘sound-
proof room with 30 people. When she
began feeling comfortable in the room, she
ﬁnally uncrossed her legs. ‘

“I thought, so what — if I make it, I
make it.” A

L And that was it, she was in.

She and the other cast members were
vaccinated for everything —— even rabies.
They were not allowed to speak to one

» another at all before they rode in the yellow

boat shown in the weekly show introduc-
tion. The CBS network had spies watching

them and four alternatives ready to take the _

place of anyone who disobeyed the rule.
Hawk commented that when she got to

Asia, she was the minority among “little

Oriental people.” I
“And they make airplane seats for little

oriental people too,” she said.

CBS gave the contestants a few days to
rest before shipping off to the island. Then it
was time for the game to begin.

5,:

. The contestants ' got litﬂe Reebok back- ‘

packs to pack for the trip. _

“I shoved all that I could ﬁt,” said
Hawk ' « .
But the network wouldn’t have that.
Representatives from CBS came into her
hotel room like drill sergeants, telling her
what she could take.

“I felt so raped. I was pissed,” Hawk
said, “They thought they were being lenient
by letting us have three pairs of underwear.
In one week [on the island] we didn’t even
wear them because of butt rash.”

Before they left I. for the ‘island, they

were told three rules of the game.

“We couldn’t hit anybody, we couldn’t
split the prize money, and we had to be at
every tribal council and competition on
time.”

' When the survivors were ﬁnally on the
raft, it was a “scream, fest.” They talked for
one and a half hours. Hawk immediately

‘disliked Jenna Lewis. ‘

“I thought, she can’t be on my team,
she’ll drive me crazy.”
' She was lucky that Lewis was not in
Pagong with her. ‘
She was also very happy wiﬂr the set-
up of the beach that her tribe was one
“It was set upperfectly. The latrine area
was way down the beach in a private coVe.”

The rats all over the island bothered.

Hawk a lot at ﬁrst.

“You could hear the rats nmning
through the leaves They ‘are everywhere. I
had a rat crawl across my back,” she said.

The Pagong members avoided rats by
sleeping undermosquito netting. When the
rodents tried to crawlunder the netting, the
Castaways kicked them away.

Hawk had a low opinion of Rudy
Boesch at ﬁrst 3

‘‘He really got on my nerves in the
beginning. He was a crotchety old man,”
she said. it s ‘

But her opinion changed about Rudy.

rThe most memorable moment of her life

‘ was spent with him.

“When we went to the snake island to
get the immunity idol, 1 was sitting there on
that boat, with the oldest navy seal. And he’s
bitchin’ at me because he said I wasn’t steer-
ing right,” she said. “And I could see the

Reconsidersurvey in light
of Morgantown success

In this unstable world, there are a
few unchanging things that you can

.. count on. Two plus two always equals

four, peanut butter always goes well
with I marshmallow Fluff — even
though that sounds weird in theory —
and West Virginia will always be the
butt of jokes as the most-redneck,
least-classy state in the union.

- K Strangely enough, it looks as if it

might be time to rethink that last one. -
- Demographics

Daily, an online
newsletter, recently ranked
Morgantown the most livable small
city  thecountry out of 631 contes-
tants. En route to its victory,
Morgantown scored well in criteria

. such as employment, freedom from
stress, support for education and -

health care. “Access to a’ cultural
mainstream” was another category in

7 which Morgantown got high marks

that A
Pittsburgh.
The news of such ratings may

cultural mecca being

come as a surprise to many, especially '
’ to Morgantowifs neighbors approxi-

mately an ‘hour northeast, who have

long considered themselves superior. .

In the same survey, the highest—rank-

ing Pennsylvanian town was State.
College at 25. Finding out that ,

Morgantown is apparently cooler than
the dwelling place of Pitt’s most hated

enemies is potentially devastating,
cause to weep,‘ throw up or ponder
extensively what this world is coming’
to. .
But why are these ratings so
important anyway? Any Joe Surveyor
can rank cities (or songs or cars or
movies and_ so on) on any basis he
chooses.‘ The criteria that“ Daily

Demographics used sound important

but are inherently subjective. Each
individual is bound to vary in the way
thathe or she weighs different aspects
of a city’s reported livability.

There are several criteria that such

surveys rarely seem to take into,

account — night life, entertainment
and attractions targeted toward

teenagers (so you don’t have an abun-

dance of bored teen hooligans causing
trouble), - traffic and quantity, rather
than quality, of educational institutions
(i.e. there seem to be about 800 col-
leges in.Boston and it’s a really cool
city —— probably not a coincidence).
Ultimately, no matter what sys-
tem a survey uses, there’s no substitute

’ for actually visiting a city to find out if

you like it. Cool, friendly people live
in just about every comer of the world,
and as long as you T have people to
hang out with, just about any city will
seem peachy. Even Morgantown and
maybe even State College.

The decline in the rate at which young peo-
ple vote is not the travesty that stalwarts defend-
ing democracy may believe. However, once the
leaders of this nation believe that lack of political
participation on thepart of any sect of society is
tolerable, the nation inadvertently suffers a self-
inﬂicted wound. Thus, it is irnpor—

voting more accessible. This means taking
advantage of technology. Internet voting would
be a pivotal move in compelling the young to
vote. Furthermore, the government or other
impartial political organizations can use ‘the

Internet as an agency to enlighten young voters.

Such organizations, not political parties, could
provide links to reputable and relevant informa-
tion on allcandidates. '

However, I think it might be necessary for
accessibility to be taken to an even more extreme
level. The young would indeed be less hesitant to
phone in their vote, as compared to going to the

polls. However,voting by phone might also be

intimidating. Providing a sample telephone ballot
could combat this problem by supplying simple
Codes for certain offices and certain candidates.

A potentially scary picture is now before us
—— that of a 19-year-old ‘pausing momentarily
from Internet chatting to hastily place a few votes,
or other young Americans dialing in votes while
watching television.

But is that not the desired result? To see
young people taldng a break from their apparent-
ly busy schedules to vote is a beautiful picture.
Young people, in general, are not stupid. True,
such meﬂrods produce no promise that these
votes will reﬂect months, let alone a week or day,
of thorough investigation. However, there will be

 

some reﬂection over the decision even if it is just -

pondering over what is written in the ballot.

, Perhaps more important than getting young
people to simply vote is teaching them how to
vote. In order to do this, lowering thevoting age
may be necessary.

Concerns about how ludicrous lowering the

  A Way 0 increase youth votr tumout

voting age would be are wananted. Upon reﬂec-
tion, however, one may realize that such an action
would increase voting in youth.

However, the answer is not lowering the vot-
ing age to 17. The answer lies in dropping the vot-
ing age to 15. Political awareness and activity
should begin in high school. High

Enfranchising 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds gives
them a chance to vote in high school when,
though they may care little about political issues,
they do have time to spare in investigating char-
acter and platforms.

The voting experience, though it cannot be
forced on anyone, should be a part of the high
school education. High school is ” compulsory.
Even if voting will never be compulsory, being
taught and exposed to the voting process and
overtly encouraged to actually vote should be.

Though enfranchising the very young may
encourage the frequency of voting, the'impor-
tance of voting still needs to be established. Along
such lines, there needs to be another more fr1nda—
mental change in the electoral process. Even avid
voters often believe, and know considering ger-
rymandering and other facts, that their votes do
not count in the grand scheme of things.

To make individual votes more important
means a restructuring in voting practice. Namely,
the adoption of proportional representation
should be -enacted. Down with the electoral col-
lege and on to a pure popular vote for president.
In regards to other elected -positions there should
be a completely open list, so voters elect candi-
dates and not parties —— that is choice voting. The
ranking of candidates for offices of which there
are single and multiple seats would make the vot-
ing process more democratic while causing
involvement to rise. r

No sides, soups or salads are included with the 7

meals, but after eating the extra-large portions, and

it overwhelmed by a full belly,‘ customers will feel

like they just devoured an entire Thanksgiving din-

All the menu items are of Mediterranean

I have Olympic fever. ,

I’m not ashamed to admit it. I
know, I know, I go through all
kinds of fevers during

 
  
 
  
 
  
 
   

the year — baseball
fever, Pokemon fever,
yogurt fever, and, most

recently, Pitt football fever
— but these are all merely
fadscompared to the fervor

, A  T, I feel for the Olympics.
 This isn’t a new
7 ‘thing. When I was lit-
-  tle I begged my parents
V ' for cable on a regular
basis, but those little blow—the-candles-out wishes
paled in comparison tothe tantrums I threw the sum-
mer before seventh grade for the almighty “Triple
Cast.”

And when the Olympics were in Atlanta when I
was in high school, I seriously thought about selling
my soul to score tickets and a plane ride. I didn’t care
what sports I got to see —- I’d even have watched mar-
bles if that tasty little game had somehow made it to
the Olympic smorgasbord.

’ I don’t know what it is about them —— I don’t real-
ly care who wins, just as long as someoneidoes and I
get to hear a national anthem and see some tears. I
don’t have a favorite sport, although the equestrian
competitions definitely top my list, even if they’re
shown on television at the crack of dawn.

‘I even spent Friday night glued to my TV set for

"the greater part of four hours watching the opening

ceremonies. Life went on around me .— fireworks and
ﬂames engulfed the Cathedral, freshmen were clued in
on the time-honored tradition of hating Penn State and
lots of kegs were tapped. I eventually made it down the
hill to frolic with the rest of civilization, but with a
great sense of remorse that I didn’t get to see what silly
hats the American team was wearing.

Now that the weekend’s over, I find myself in the
biggest of quandaries — are the summer games worth
skipping classes for? The answer, unfortunately, is

probably not. T here’.s no Dream Team this year, but the

women’s soccer team will definitely be recorded, and
lots of action will be broadcasted during the wee hours
of the night —— perfect for an insomniac like myself.

There are televisions all over campus to utilize and
catch up on the track and field events (aside from the
obvious choices of the big screen in the “Red Room”
of the Union and the TV room on. the ground ﬂoor, a
lot of student organizations have sets, as does the
laundry room in Holland Hall), and there’s free cable
in every dorm room, as well.

So, even if I have to cart my 13,-inch around all day
and woo some sophomoreinto letting me set up shop in
his bedroom, 24-hour Olympic coverage, what I have
been craving for so-long, will be had.

LESLIE HOFFMAN
Staff Writer

You may_ not associate Graham
Nash, of Crosby,*Stil1,s, Nash and
Young fame, with photography or

technological advancements, but N ash.

is in fact a pioneer in the ﬁeld
of digitally enhanced
photography and
printing.

In 1990, Nash
and colleague R.
Mac Holbert founded
Nash Editions, a studio
dedicated to the print-

ing of digitally, enhanced photographs. I

‘Since 1990,.photographers of all gen-
res have explored this new photo’-
graphic frontier to print and publish

‘ their work. '

The South Side’s Silver Eye
Center for Photography currently hosts
“Digital Frontiers: Photography’s
Future at Nash Editions.” ’

During the late 1980s, Nash and
Holbert searched for ways to “output”
Nash’_s digitally manipulated black-
and-white photographs. At this time,

the technology existed to create quali- '
ity digital photographs, but not to print

them. ‘
Enter the ‘IRIS. 3047 Graphics‘

Printer. Nash and Holbert call IRIS the 1

“key to the process.” In the early
1990s, the duo recognized the printers
potential and perfected it to print on

   
  
  
  

specific types of photo-quality paper. A
Nash himself has only two pho-
tographs in the exhibit. One of the two,
“Self-Portra.it,”w'as initially taken in
1974, but reprinted in 1992..

“Self—Portrait’,’ pictures young
Nash in a tiled bathroom. The black-
and—white photograph employs the use

i V of reflections so that Nash appears in

both the background and -the fore-.

ground, where he peers at himself in a‘

shaving mirror.

Nash’s unassuming photographs
hang in the gallery alongside other
innovative» photographers’, work.

Some pieces are reminiscent of -

surrealist images of ‘the 19203, inter-
weaving poetry and visual art with
photography to comment on ethnic,
political, and social issues. Other
pieces rely purely on the unique print-
ing process to enhance the image.
Peter Alexander’s
complementary prints
“Westwood” and
“Bundy” explore
the use of light.
Both prints feature
out-of-focus Los
Angeles skylines at
night and have been
printed on translucent Japanese Gampi
paper, which enforces their lumines-
cent quality. 9
Another interesting use of the

process includes photographer Olivia ,

Parker’s digitally enhanced b1ack—and-
white ~° photographs. . The exhibit
includes three similar images of white
pottery embellished with archaic‘ ,sci—
entific etchings. V

' The etchings mirror the form of
the pottery. For example, an etching of
a pregnant woman’s womb’ adorns a
curvy pitcher. Ahead with its top cut

off decorates an empty cup. .

Regardless of the message th

artist conveys, the process remains-

key. The exhibit features such an array
of work it is apparent photographers of
all genres will continue to embrace
this new technology. I

Pitt vollll ea

wins Cowgirl Classic

FRAN AIELLO

Staff Writer

Pitt volleyball head coach Chris
Beerman says that volleyball competition
depends 'a lot on momentum. The last
three non-conference matches deﬁnitely
helped to build the momentum behind
the Panthers this weekend as they cap-

tured the championship of the Cowgirl

Classic.
“It’s nice to win three in a row,”

[Beerman said. “We got considerably bet-

ter in each mate .”, . .
Beerman and the Panthers went into
this weekend coming off a loss to Indiana

. in the last game of the Pittsburgh
. Invitational and lost again to a tough

Utah State team in a dual match not relat-
ed to the tournament.

Pitt vs. Utah State L
In regards to momentum, Beerman

wished he could have played the NCAA
tourney contenders last. _ -

“They put a lot of pressure on us,” he
said. .

Utah State swept Pitt in three games,
winning by the score of 15-11, 15-12, 15-
1. This match dropped Pittsburgh to 5-4
on the season. Pitt combined" for two total
blocks the entire game and had some
attack problems with a relatively low
attack average, .036. A

When asked what he wants to
improve for the next big matchup like the
one against Utah State, Beerman said that
the team has been working very hard to
improve on almost every aspect of the
game, focusing on every skill. Beerman
also commented that he noticed a little
more instinctual play in the Panthers as
the games progressed and hopes to see
increases inpercentages in the future.

Pitt vs. Wisconsin-Green Bay
The momentum came back -to the

the tourney and increased their record to
6-4 in a three-game sweep of “Wisconsin-
Green Bay. The scores were 15-7, ‘15-10,

1-9 on the season.

The attack average jumped back up

Men’s soccer tops
Friars, now 5-0

MATT MILOSZEWSKI
The Pitt News

The No. 18 Pitt men’s soccer team got
its ﬁfth straight win, beating Providence 2-1
Sunday in overtime at Quaker Va]ley.I-Iigh
School in Sewickley, Pa ‘

The win marks Pitt’s best start since
1986, when the Panthers also began 5-0.

Pitt opened the scoring Sunday with a
header goal by senior midﬁelder Ben Garry.
Redshirt junior defender Chris Churchill
took a free kick from just outside the
Providence goal box. He lofted the ball
toward the right side of the net and Garry
came across and headed it in, giving the
Panthers an early 1-0 lead. The goal came at
the 30:28 mark of the ﬁrst half. It was
Garry’s third goal of the season.

It seemed as if the Panthers’ lone goal
would stand as the game winner because of
solid defensive play in the second half. The
defense, led by Churchill and freshman
Clay Haﬂich, kept the relentless Friar pres-
sure off of sophomore goalie Justin Gaul.

However, the pressure became too
much for the Panthers when, with 12 sec-

onds to play in the game, the Friars got on
the board. Friars senior midﬁelder Dane

Smith crossed the ball from right to left on   .
I the Pitt ‘defense, where senior forward

Kevin Jones quickly ﬁred a shot past Gaul.
The goal tied the game and forced overtime.

It tookthe Panthers just over 10 min-
utes into overtime to end the game. After a
pass deﬂected off a Friars defender, junior
forward Mark Sikora ‘slipped the ball past
Providence goalie Darmy Glynn into the
empty net. ‘

“[I just wanted to] get it on goal. The
goalie Went down then I saw white,” Sikora
said after the game.

The unassisted goal was Sikora’s fourth
of the ‘year, making him the team leader. The

win puts -Pitt in position for a big match A

against No. 4 Connecticut Friday. The
Panthers seem to be looking forward to the
game. . A

“[Our goal is to be] 6-0 going into
Friday night,” Sikora said. “UConn is a big
game because we are both ranked.”

First, the Panthers must get by
Canisius, which they play tonight at 7:30 at
Quaker Valley High School in an attempt to
move to 6-0. '

l_-Iarris not worried about a
letdown after big victory

BRAD CUPRIK
a . . Assistant Sports.Editor

Pitt’s 12-0 win over Penn State on
Saturday was a reason to celebrate for
head coach Walt Harris and his staff. But
in the past the team has seen letdowns
after big wins. . i

In 1997, Pitt stunned Miarni,,21-17,
on a Thursday night in front of anation-
al television audience on ESPN. The fol-

lowing Saturday, Pitt traveled to Temple, -

and promptly 1o_st, 17-13.
Last season, the Panthers closed out

5 Pitt Stadium with a 37-27 win over"

T Notre Dame in front of a national televi-
sion audience on CBS. The following

Friday, Pm traveled to West ‘Virginia and

were lambasted, 52-21,. A _

. Now, a week after again appearing
on CBS, the Panthers host a team that
they will probably be heavily favored
over, the Rutgers Scarlet Knights.

Harris discussed a possible letdown
at Monday’s weekly press conference, as
well as the play of Bryan Knight, who
was honored as the Big East Defensive
Player of the Week for the second con-

secutive week.

I -“I told the team that I’m not going
into this game with the same rnind-set as
I did last year against West Virginia,”
Harris-said. 

He also said that the Panthers were a
different team than they were last year
and in 1997.

“We had different guys and different ’

leadership,” Harris said. “I’m not wor-
ried about us having a letdown.’’

- V -If the Panthers lose‘ to Rutgers on

Saturday, it will be more to do with the
Scarlet Knights playing better, according
to Harris. 0

Marina and Pitt outshine the 

R The city of Pittsburgh played the
numbers game this iweekend. Pitt-12,
Penn State-0 is the sweetest Panther
score in quite a while. A record of 0-2,
and the Steelers’ long year is getting
even longer. No.13, Pitt’s favorite son,
is immortalized in 

For the  of Pittsburgh and its
football fans this last weekend held a

long-awaited Victory, a crushing, per-

plexing defeat, and the last hurrah of
one of its prominent ﬁgures of the past.
Let’s start with that crushing defeat.
Coming off a bye week, the Steelers
hoped to recover from their 0-1 start by
beating the Browns in Cleveland. .

d What they got instead was a 23-20 _
loss to a team that only re-entered the»

league a year ago, and many fans of the
Steelers are still trying .,to: ﬁgure out
why. . ’ ' 

- Well, they don’t need to think really
hard. There’s no multiple choice needed

here. It was t-jheplayer in the No. 11_“

black and gold jersey looking up at the
sky after the Steelers’ third down at the
Browns’ 6-yard line.

It was the player who subsequently

ran frantically around the ﬁeld in disar- ‘

ray as the ﬁnal seconds ticked away
leaving the Browns to celebrate their
first home victory in ﬁve years.
Steelers’ fans, look no further than
quarterback Kent Graham, who at that

‘another hapless fran— “

1’ goal.

moment sat on the ﬁeld and racked his
brain for answers as to‘why he didn’t
throw the ball away instead of being
sacked. Graham’s bumbling is the rea-
son the Steelers lost on Sunday, so let
the callsfor his head begin now, and let
them not end until he is
off screwing up plays

and losing games for

  
 
    
  
  

chise. . J ,
With 14 seconds left
in the game, head‘ coach

Bill Cowher elected not to
go for a field goal that could

have tied the game, but instead
put the gamein the hands of the
veteran Graham,‘ who, Cowher
hoped, would either throw ,a, touch-
down pass or have enough, sense to
throw the ball away, so the'~Stee1ers

could have enough _time7.left"- on the

clock to have one last ‘shot”at=the ﬁeld

R Graham was unable todo either as
he looked for an open P receiver, saw
none and rather than throwing the ball
away, stepped up in the pocket and was
sacked. ; ' A

After the sack, the Steelers tried
desperately to get their ﬁeld goalrunit in
place with Graham, after a short time
jumpingaround, getting down to hold
for the kicker, but time just ran out.

0ﬁSView

Graham. may have actually been
remembered for having a good perfor-
mance on Sunday, throwing for 193
yards and no interceptions, but that one
stupid play killed the Steelers’ chances
and continued to tarnish ‘his reputation
with the other players.
The Browns may have
V looked better than the
 A Steelers on Sunday, but
they still aren’t a good
team and have hardly a
chance of making the play-
offs. '

  

With games against the
Tennessee Titans, the New York

Jets and the
Shaun Jacksonville Jaguars in

_ the -coming weeks, the

 Steelers, scarred by

Graham’s poor deci-_

sion-making, probably just blew their

best chance of getting a win. in quite a,

while. .

At the opposite end of the spectrum,
Walt Harris and the Panthers ﬁnally
stuck it to JoePa and the Nittany Lions,
12-0 at Three Rivers Stadium. While the

Steelers lacked leadership and .consis- -

tency at .the quarterback position, the
Panthers seemed to have plenty to spare
as John Turman and Rod Rutherford
both pulled off big plays against the
Lions.

While the Steelers lacked good play
calling on offense, the Panthers experi-
enced no such shortage, amassing 379
against a strong Lions defensive unit.

And while the Steelers don’t seem

to have a beatable opponent in the next »

few weeks, the Panthers should be
heavy favorites at home against
Rutgers.

Finally, former Pitt star and future
National Football League Hall-of-
Famer Dan Marino had his number
retired by the Miami Dolphins at half-
time of their game against the Baltimore
Ravens.

It rained the entire first half, but the '

dark clouds parted at the break.
Fireworks and a marching band comple-
mented the raising of Marino’s jersey,
solidifying his place in NFL history.

‘ Some of the Panther in Marino must
have rubbed off on the Dolphins. Just as
Pitt could not lose to Notre Dame in the
final game at Pitt Stadium, or back
down to archrivals Penn State in the
ﬁnal scheduled meeting between the
two, the Dolphins celebrated victory on
thenight that their superstar quarterback
from Pitt was taking his ﬁnal curtain
call. Final score: Dolphins 19,
Ravens 6

V “We have him in a sling right now,”
Shea said. “But we expect him to play.
You can tell Walt that we’re doing every-
thing we can to get McMahon ready" to
play-”. I g .

' “I ﬁnally got the chance to meet him
overthe summerand I thought he was a

McMahon is 6—foot_—3—inches, andis

. listed at 215 ‘pounds, and has deceptive
speed. Over the summer, he ran .thei40— ‘

McMahon, a

Panthers two years ago at Pitt Stadium
by a Score of 25-21. . S. i .

The Scarlet Knights were down, 21-

McMahon threw two third-quarter.

touchdowns for the comeback victory.

Shea noted that his defense ’will_

- game.

“I don’t know if were ready for an

Shea ‘said. “We have to ﬁnd different
ways of rushing the quarterback to take
some pressure off of our'coverage.”»

Pitt wide receivers Latef Grim and ‘I
' Antonio Bryant burned the Scarlet

Knights for 16 receptions for 275 yards
inlas_tcyear’s victory.

This week, however, the focus was
on Knight and the Panther defense. .

After the shutout ‘of Penn State, .

Knight earned his second straight award
by recording eight tackles, three sacks
and four total tackles fora loss.

He now has seven sacks on the sea-
son, all of which have come in the last
two games. p ,

“I think ,I’ve been playing pretty
well, but there a few things that I still.

need to do better,” Knight said. “Most of ’

my sacks have been thanks to good cov-
erage by our defensive backs.”

‘Harris’. is concerned, but "not any

more than usual. .
“Our goal is to win football games,”

V Harris said. “In a sense, this is no differ-
‘ent than last week in that our goal is the

same.”
