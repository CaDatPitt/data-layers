Pittsburgh to Host Mayors ’gConference This Weekend

By JEPF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

Until- the state legislature okays the general funds
portions of the Pennsylvania budget. Pitt and the three

other state-related universities——Lincoln, Temple and Penn‘

State—must wait patiently for appropriations.

The Senate voted Tuesday not to comply with the House A

version of Gov. Richard L. Thornburgh’s 1979-80-budget.
Approval was withheld, in part, due to continued division
over funding various components of the state
appropriations bill, according to Thomas Lamb, assistant
vice-chancellor, governmental relations.

House members must make some provision to raise
revenue to cover budget obligations before the Senate
approves the bill, Lamb said. ’

The revenue issue revolves around personal and
corporate net income tax levels. Currently, those levels are
2.2 and 10 percent respectively. Some legislators favor
reversion back to 1977 levels of 2 percent personal, and .9
percent corporate net income taxes.

“If the current tax levels expire, there will be no funds
(to back a recently approved 6.5 percent increase in
appropriations for Pitt),”/ Lamb said. , ‘

He added that if the House fails to act on the tax
question, revenue levels will automatically be based on
1977 levels, effective December .30. I

Scorers Quit After
Kison Controversy    

By The Associated Press

Two scorers for the Pittsburgh
Pirates have resigned in the wake
of a controversial call that kept
Bruce Kison from becoming the
192nd pitcher in baseball history to
have thrown a no‘-hitter.

Kison was four outs away from a
no-hit game against the San Diego
Padres last Sunday when Barry
Evans hit a grounder near the third
base bag. The ball tipped infielder
Phil Garner’s glove and rolled into
left ﬁeld. .

Rather than charge Garner with
an error, scorer Dan Donovan
called the play a hit and ended
Kison’s. dream of a no-hitter.

After the game, a 7-0 victory for

the Pirates, Kison charged scorer-

Donovan with making a bad call.

Donovan, a sports writer for the
Pittsburgh Press, was then banned
by the newspaper from serving as a
scorer after the current season.
This season was Donovan's first on
the job. ‘

“It’s obvious that they don’t
want an official scorer who calls
’em as he sees ’em,” Press Editor

 John Troan said‘ in announcing the
decision.  ' ~ » .

 

“It’s equally obvious that a I
. baseball writer who doubles as an
official scorer places himself in a 

position where he cannot possible

avoid a conflict of interest,” Troan .,

said. _

The team’s other scorer, Charley
Feeney of ‘the Pittsburgh. Post-
Gazette, said Wednesday he would
no longer serve in that capacity

after the current home stand ends.

Sunday. Feeney has been an
official major league scorer for 25
years. 1

“I wish you were scoring,”
Kison told Feeney on Sunday. “I

would have called it a hit,” Feeney -

replied. .
Feeney said in a news story that

a poll of the media watching the ‘

game from the press box indicated
unanimous approval of Donovan’s
call. .~
However, Kison pointed out that
in some big-league cities ‘the
ofﬁcial scorers seem to favor the
home team. ‘ ~ .

“It was a once in a lifetime thing ‘ ‘
for me,” Kison said. Of course; I *
i wanted it bad. Real bad“ I thought; 
under the.tcircumst.ances_he could 

have calledit an erect.” »,

Opinion

I

When and
  How, Much

One of the most helpless feelings one can encoun-
ter, is knowing something disastrous is about to hap-
pen and knowing too, that nothing can be done
about it. .

That feeling is common among Pitt students,
knowing that fall tuition will indeed be-increased this
year, but not knowing the amount of the hike or even

when they’ll find out. The apprehension might not ,

be one of disaster, but will be an undesirable han-

 dicap at best. ‘

.9

The state senate must first pass the general budget
before Pitt and other state related universities receive
their appropriations. Tuesday, the senate rejected
the house version of the budget on the grounds that
the state lacks sufficient revenue to fund various
components of the bill. This pushes passage of the
budget and the consequential dealings with ap-
propriations into some unknown date and time in the
future.

The delay is a particular blow to students applying
for scholarships, most of which must be filed by par-
ticular deadlines. Most scholarships do not
automatically take into account tuition hikes, slipped
in while applications wind through endless rolls of
red tape.

While we realize that Pitt administrator-s are also
functioning—and being inconvenienced—-—byv the
legislators, we believe measures can be taken to aid
students. Perhaps projected estimates of the budget
deficit could be circulated. Possibly, students could
be granted an automatic extension on paying tuition
for fall. Maybe there could even be a means for

’ students to reapply for fall scholarship and other aid

that would take the new figures into account.
\ After all, students will be the ones to bear the
brunt of an insufficient budget, just as they have in

the past, should ' Harrisburg’s contributions fall
short. Since there has been anincrease in tuition at
Pitt every year in recent times, it is prudent to expect

- that this year will be any different.

But it is unrealistic for anyone to expect students to
pay without at least an estimate of the increase.
If the budget is not passed by a set deadline,
deadlines on aid applications should be adjusted ac-
cordingly. It would, at least, give students a fighting
chance.

Carter’s Day of Reckoning Draws Closer and Closer

By RODGRIFFITH

The day of reckoning for Jimmy
Carter’s Rhodesian policy, June 15,
draws closer every day, and
pressures pushing him to lift
economic sanctions against Rho-
desia have already reached their
A “sense of the Senate”
resolution calling for the end to
sanctions and the election of a
Conservativegovernment in Bri-
tain could force Carter eventually
to abandon the British-American
plan for majority rule in Rhodesia.

Although the election of Bishop
Abel T. Muzorewa as the first blaék
prime minister of Rhodesia repre-
sents a significant step toward an
eventual solution to the civil war in
that south African nation, the new
government does not deserve the
enthusiastic embrace many Sena-

..;'j7tors urge the president to offer by

lifting all sanctions. _ The “internal
accord” under which Muzorewa
was elected has enough of
loopholes to. make the new
government only a masquerade of
rule by Rhodesia’s black majority.
Rhodesian whites are guaran-
teed 28 of the 100 seats in
parliament under the internal
accords and thus have enough
votes to veto any attempt to amend
the constitution, which requires
approval by two-thirds of the
national legislative body. The

whites also control the army and
police, so that the minority that has
ruled Rhodesia for so long still
holds the reins of power in the
nation. Such an arrangement
makes the .bishop's government
tenuous at best and a sham at
worst.

With Muzorewa ‘elected under
the ﬂimsy arrangement for major-
ity rule, lifting sanctions only
would alienate’ the front-line
African nations -that support the
Popular Front guerilla movement
and would fail to bring any final
solution to the civil war. The
Popular Front refused to partici-
pate in the recent elections and can
be expected to continue its battle
whether or not the United States
lifts sanctions.

Any disruption of U.S. relations
with the front-line countrieswould
push them into closer alliance with
the Soviet Union and make the
United States appear to be the
white-suited demon defending
neo-colonialism in the third world.
In such a situation, it would be

impossible for the United States to -

influence events in Rhodesia
without collusion with Ian Smith,
and surrenders any chance for
initiating a solution to the civil war
to the Soviets, who undoubtedly
will continue to back the Popular
Front with arms. The Popular
Front with Soviet supplies could
topple the Muzorewa government

and install yet another anti-Ameri-
can regime in a third-world
country.

This scenario for Rhodesia
sounds strangely familiar, because
it mirrors U.S. foreign policy
failures in both Iran and Vietnam.
In these cases the United States
supported doomed governments
that lacked the popular support
needed to sustain them. Despite
the obvious and widespread op-
position to the Shah, and to the
Diem and Thieu regimes, the
United States blindly and deter-
minedly backed these governments
until their inevitable collapse.

Although it should be more than

‘clear that the United States cannot

continue to support governments
such as the Shah’s and Muzorewa’s
and have good relations with
developing nations, the near-sight-
ed moderates and conservatives in
the Senate seem intent on pursuing

the business as usual path of
diplomacy, until the United States
is bereft of any allies in the third
world.

The eventual cost of continuing
support of semi-legitimate gov-
ernments like the Shah’s and
Muzorewa’s is foretold by the
outcome of the Iranian revolution.
Because of the United State’s

dogged backing of the Shah when it

was apparent he had ostracized
himself from everyone in his
country, the United States failed to

make peace with the opposing.

factions such as the Ayatollah
Khomeini and lost any chance it
had to keep CIA installations
needed to monitor Soviet rocket
sites. g ‘
Carter’s policy in Africa has been
amazingly sensible until now, and
shows his administration is aware
oftheconcilatory stance the United
States must take toward move-

ments such as the Popular Front if
this nation is to maintain its
inﬂuence in Africa and the rest of
the third" world. Without this
enlightened policy, the United
(States faces complete isolation as
the forces of change bring rulers

like.the Ayatollah Khomeini and '

Joshua Nkomu to power.

Hopefully, Carter can hold his
African policy on its present course
despite pressure from the Senate to
embrace tacitly the Muzorewa
government.
president's current policy shows
that he has learned more from the
United States’ past foreign policy
mistakes than the Senators who
backed the Schweiker resolution on
Rhodesia. If he choses to follow the
path the,” Senators favor, the
president would hasten the decline
of the United States’ world status,
which the Senators mistakenly
believe they are ensuring.

Insight Offered Into Arrest

It was with interest that I read‘
the short statement on the release
of Anthony Eaves on rape charges.

tion that I have that might be of
interest to your readers.

cause he was identiﬁed from a
5-year-old Schenley High School
year book as resembling the rapist.
It was done by city police although
some Campus police maintained
that he did not meet the original
description given by the student.
He was held on $50,000 bond even
though he was the wrong height
and his voice was- completely
different, and even though he was
documented to be in a’ different
place at that time. He tried without

success to get the police to give him ’

a lie detector and blood test until
finally after a week, his lawyer got
the judge to order them. He was
then freed on reduced bond
pending the outcome of the tests
and released once the tests showed
that he was not the rapist.

Tony is a fine individual who is
very active in his community. In
fact, he was a candidate for election
to a community organization at the
time of his arrest. This incident
has branded him, and as you can
see, the retractions in no way
matched the notoriety that went
withzhis arrest. To many, he will
represent a rapist who “beat the
system," when, in fact, it was the

system that damaged and almost -

ruined him.
There are many lessons--in all

this. It shows that when the police
are put under pressure, people
become expendable. This is
especially true if they are Black.
Since Tony was of a different world
than that of the victim’s ’ or
arresting ofﬁcers, he could be
arrested with little discomfort or
inconvenience to those people. The
fact that little effort is being made
to right the wrong Tony exper-
ienced demonstrates this clearly.
But events like these add_up and
lead to the anger and resentment
and ﬁnally revenge felt “by so many
minorities. Cases like Tony’s
happen much too often.

The University, the police, and
the community owe an apology to
Tony. They also must renew their
commitment to true justice, re-
membering also the harm they
have the power to inﬂict on the
innocent. Lastly, they must
remember that cultural differences
to not excuse slipshod police work.
Every person is entitled to
protection by the law until proven
guilty, and violation of this
protection without clear cut evi-
dence
