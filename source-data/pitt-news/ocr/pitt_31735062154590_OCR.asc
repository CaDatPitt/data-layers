Aciidemic Contests Is
.; c0If,;McKown. Says

Pitt’s spring academic contest,

in w_hichV.Western Pennsylvania and
-.Ea’_stern Ohio high schools have par-
ticipated for a ;n’umber”of years,
will not .be‘ held this year, an-
nounces Dr. H. C.- McKown, profes-
sor of secondary education and
chairman of ‘-the ‘contest committee.
Dr. McKown "was unable. to say
whether or not the contests‘ would
be resumed next year. t .
t , The principal reason cited for‘ the
elimination of this year's contest
was the “unwieldly size" to which
they had grown. Dr.—- -"McKown
pointed -out the fact thatjin the past
five years the number of contestants
increased.‘ from ‘ 250 'to_ approxi-
mately 1,500. The great number-of.
students taking partin the contests
had necessitated the shortening of
the examination to‘ half hour
periods which were considered in-
adequate for _a true test of 3. sm-
dent’s ability.

The contests, which have ‘been
held annually at Pitt since 1919,
reached their climax. last year when
more than‘-£30 schools were repre-
sented. Atfull weekwas’ required to
grade all‘ examination papers. ‘Dr.
McKown has :been in charge of theV
contests since 1923. -

The “Y” hut remodeling plan has
been revived, for after two months
of inaction on the-prop.osal_.toi re-
move student activities and the
dean of~men’s and related«oﬂ_‘ices to
the hut, the project has been resur-'

Apparently agreement has been
reached upon the main point of con-
troversy, which has prevented ‘ﬁnal
agreement on the drawings'and.ac-
tual construction work ever. since
the proposal was approved‘ in gen-
eral January 28. “An understanding
has been reached,” said Don C.
Shumaker, executive secretary of
the Y. M. C.. A., “on the division of
office-space. An extra‘ partition will
be built at the end of the hut.”

A. H. Armbruster, acting dean of
men, indicated Wednesday that the
new suggestions put forth by. the
“Y” for ending-the controversy are

cussion, and said that" he awaited
the arrival of John Weber, business
manager, who was out of ‘the city
all week, to consider again whether
the project is worth the $5,000 it
would cost. _The detailed plans
would then be approved.

While the “Y” hut changeswere
being‘ discussed in" February, com-
muting students who use the hut
opposed them because they would
entail elimination of the cafeteria
service there- Serious question was

Yes, the professor was actu-
ally embarrassed at the men-
tion-of a woman's intimate ap-
parel. Still, “Yip-Yip,” Cap
and Gown show, is modern to
say the least. It presents a
cross section of college life
with all the slangy wise-crack-
ing humoreof Joe and Joseph-'
ine, but .'that is .by,no means
all. There is the usual collec-
tion of cosmopolitans-and the
deck-hand in dungarees.

“The book is new as Cap and
‘Gown productions go,” says
Walter B. Edmundsen, director
.of the show. “It is modern,
