A glance over the events of the
past year’s calendar will reveal to the
eye the prominent parts the fraterni-
ties of the University have played on
the stage of activity during the term
1915-1916. This has been a period of
great accomplishments along fraternal
lines and one not to be cast into obli-
vi-on by any records of time for it
marks an era of unusual development
in the social life of the school.

At the beginning of the ﬁrst semes-
ter there were three s-ororities in the
University, all local, but during the
course of theiterm all were made na-
tional organizations. The C. I. C.‘
Club became, on November 5, 1915,
Zeta Tau Alpha; Pi Theta Nu became

’. Kappa Alpha Theta on December 4,
191.5; Delta Omicron became Tri-Delta
at a. later date. To this list was also
added Delta Zeta, which became ‘na-
tional as soon as it was organized.
After their initiation into their new
respective chapters and other neces-
sary ceremonies, each sorority held
an installation reception to publicly
announce their new standings in the
University.

But this was -not all. The greatest
and best thing of the year was the
formation of the Panhellenic Associa-
tion. Realizing that only “in union
there is strength”, the sororities de-
termined on such an organization,
which is n-ow represented by Kappa
Alpha Theta, Zeta Tau Alpha, Tri-
Delta and Delta Zeta. The object of
this association is to promote the in-
terests of the school and the fra-
ternity, and to raise the present edu-
cational and social standings, relative

REVIEW on WORK

Men Make Trip to Washington
and Have Audience with Pres-
ident of United States.

Judging from the results accomp-
lished, the Miisicafl Clubs this year
had the most successful season of
their existence. Twenty-one concerts
were given besides several appearan-
ces at local and University. functions;
a clear year ﬁnancially was experi-
enced; new territory was invaded with
the resultant publicity given to the
University; the musical standard’ of
the clubs and the University in gen-
eral was enhanced; and the attitude
-toward and the interest in the clubs
were greatly stimulated.

For the ﬁrst time since the plan was
inaugurated the annual Pitt-State
concert on Thanksgiving eve was
eliminated. Much disappointment was
expressed by the students at the time,
but this was annulled by the satisfac-
tion in regard to» the Home Concerts.

The first appearance of the c.lubs
was at ‘Marshalsea, where a ‘ﬁrst-night’
affair was staged before the Christmas
vacation. This pilgrimage to the pity

 Pi»tt-Sta1te1festival. The patroness sys-

tem was eliminated and the students
were. given first choice for the tickets.
This plan met with universal approval
and advantage was taken of the excep-
tional opportunity. 1

And the students I were not disap-
pointed in the concerts. Working un-
der the tutelage of John L. ‘High,
’99, the ‘Glee Club was at its best for
these home aﬁairs, and responded to
the leadership of William T. Canan,
’17, with a precision and exactness
that showed the result of constant re-
hearsals. The Mandolin club scored

1 a ‘big hit and reflected credit on the

Coach, «Geo. ’M~cNemery, and the stud-
ent leader, Floyd A. Franklin, '16.

“Jack” Thompson repeated his cap»
tivating’ performances of last year and
it seemed that the audiences could not
get enough of his readings.”

Tkhemost pleasing part of the pro-
gram, especially from the poiﬂ~ of view
of-amalumnus, was the appearance of

Clubbers of .a quarter century ago, in
the days of W. U. P. “Jack” High

It is hoped
that this will feature many concerts

The1crowning event of the organiza-

tion, from the viewpoint of the mem-

bers, was the trip to Washington, D.
C. after the spring vacation. For four

. days; the musicians enjoyed the sights

to and fromithe Capitol City together
with’ all the points of interest in and
around the City Beautiful. Meeting
President Wilson was but one of many
events which were imprinted on the
minds of the fellows who made the
tip. This concert closed the activi-
ties‘ for the Yhar. , '

' -Prospects for next year are very
bright as only seven men are los-t to
the clubs this year. At least one
long trip will be taken and there will
be plenty of inducements for the men
with any musical ability to come out
and try for places on the clubs.

Omicron Delta Kappa Members
To Be Presented With Pins on
Class Day-

 

An honorary national fraternity, Om-
icron Delta Kappa, similar in pur-
pose to Phi Beta Kappa, but recogniz-
ing -those who have attained special
distinction in undergraduate activities
and leadership as well as in purely
academic pursuits will be installed in
the University Friday morning. The
presentation of the pins to members

will be a part of the Class Day exer-‘

cises. A luncheon will be held at the
Schenley immediately after the exer-
cises. The following will be initiated:
Alumni members——eGeorge M. P. Baird,
and John J. O’Connor; Faculty mem-
bers—-F. A. C. Perrin and H, C. Kidd;
Student .Seniors——J. Dolph Stark, pres-
ident Y. M. C. A.;' S. D. Flynn, basket-
ball manager; A. Parkin Miller, pres-
dent of the Senior Class; Edwin B.
'Hurrel, president Y. M‘. C. A. Cabinet;
J. Steele Gow, baseball manager; Ken-

neth Gould, Past Editor ‘Pitt Weekly;

Juniors——Edward Langdon, baseball;
Al Paul Lefton, business manager Pitt
Weekly; J. Russell Willison, president
of the «Student Senate; Norman A.
MacL»eod, chairman Junior Prom Com-
mittee; Daniel T. R. Dickson, mana-
ger Glee ‘Clubs; John A. Thompson,
president of the Junior Class; William
Churchill Arther, manager-in-chief 1917
Owl; George Ketchum, sporting edi-
tor, University of Pittsburgh; Sopho-
mores, IG-erald Thomas Morrow, man-
ager-in-chief 1918 Owl.

The ceremonies will be conducted
by Carl Fisher of Washington and
Lee University, the general secretary
of Omicron Delta Kappa.

The founding of the Omicron Delta
Kappa was the result of a desire for
some honorary organization to give
recognition to men who have attained
distinction in any legitimate line of
college aptivity, and to bring the
various activities of the camp-
us community into a -closer re-
lationship. The line between the in-
dividual groups in most colleges is

After ”wefeks.of careful planning the

Delta Kappa. Society took place at,-
Washington and Lee‘ University. The“ .

Omicron Delta Kappa. Society occu-
pies aplace. in -campus life peculiar
to itself andfits great success from
the very beginning has demonstrated
exclusively. that no mistake was_ made
bythose who established the organi-
zation.  “

The following extracts from the
constitution of the Society will show
the original purpose by which the
founders‘ of the Omicron Delta Kappa
Society were actuated in its estab-
lishment.

It is the,-desire of the Omicron Delta

Ka.ppa.1?Socie?ty “to recognize men who
have attained a high standard of
efficiency in collegiate activities, and
to inspire others to strive for conspicu-
ous attainments along similar lines”.

Among the advantages of the Omi-
cron Delta Kappa Society may be men-
tioned the following:

1. It includes in its scope all de-
partments and phases of college life.

2. It draws the varying interests

and activities of the college campus me

closer together, thus broadening the
attitude of each. 1

:3. -It is unique in its essential feat-
ures, being unlike any other honorary
organization now in existence.

4. It does not aim at competing
with -any other societies whtever,
whether honorary or fraternal.

5. It emphasizes moral character
and an even balance in the develop-
ment of the college student.

6. It serves as a common meeting
ground for all the leaders on the camp-
us.

7. Its broad scope makes it more
distinctly exclusive than is the case
with organizations.

8. It permits the recognition of a
man as early as his sophomore year
in college.

9. It serves to mould the sentiment
of the college community on important
questions of local ‘interest.

The following quoted from the con-
stitution, is sufﬁcient to indi.cate the
necessary requirements for member-
ship in the Q)micron Delta Kappa. So-
ciety: ‘

“The membership in this Society
shall consist of two classes; first ac-
tive, and second associate.”

‘The active membership shall con-
sist of three divisions: ﬁrst students

of the institution, in which the circle L

is located, as hereinafter provided;
second alumni‘ instructors resident in
the same institution; four members
of the active faculty of the same in-
stitution, who shall be elected, one
each year, for aterm of four years,
provided that no faculty member shall

Engineering’ School to Open
Earlier on June 19—All Schools
End August 26.

 

The summer term of the College,
School of Education, School of Eco-
nomics, Graduate "School and School
of Chemistry of the University will
begin on M’onday, June_26, and will
continue for eight weeks, ending Sat-
urday, August 19. The summer term
of the School of Engineering will be-
gin on June 19 and will continue for
ten weeks, ending August 26. A

Since the adoption by the Univer-

sity of the change from the term
basis of credits to the semester, the
regular University year is thus di-
vided into two parts instead of three,

tained are only two-thirds as many,
although each is of relatively as great
a value.

The full term is just one-half the
length of the semester’s work; there-
fore one-half of a .semester’s work
may be accomplished in the Summer
Term. ; V

A credit in ‘the Summer Term is
equivalent of two recitations a week,
for eight weeks. The work in the
summer term will be of the same qual-
ity as that in any of the other terms.
The instruction will be given by reg-
ular members of the University fac-
ulty, assisted by able teachers from
other institutions. Credits toward a
University degree are given for the
work of the Summer School.

By scheduling classes for Saturday,
the Work of a full term can be done in
the eight weeks of the summer term.

The instruction offered in the sum-
mer term of the University is de-
signed for the following classes of
students:

1. Teachers in elementary schools,
high schools, preparatory schools,
college instructors, or others who
wish advanced instruction and oppor-

reference to a degree. -

2. _Those‘who wish to secure credit
for college work in the University ior
credit towards a degree.

‘1 tional problems or at special class.

 The lectures and conferences of the
past years conducted by eminent edu-
cat-ors and scientists, were so success-
ful that it has been decided to-make
‘them a regular featureof our summer
terms. 1 . . ,

In accordance with the suggestions

of a number of those who enjoyed the

lectures and conferences the past two
years, special effort will be made this
year to. make those features so val-
uable and distinctive as to make each
week of the term-stand out as devoted
to the interests of one prominent as-
pect of education or of social progress.
To this end, not only have lecturers
of national reputation been secured
as leaders, but special efforts will be
made to call to the University for
the entire week those persons in
Western Pennsylvania who are work-
ing in that ﬁeld, or who are interest-
ed in its problems, to participate in
the several programs.

Each week, therefore, there will be

six special lectures by a recognized
authority and ﬁve conferences. The
lectures will be delivered daily at
eleven o’clock, and the conferences
will be held at three o’clock each
Monday to Friday, in-
elusive.
All meetings will be free to the pub-
University credit will be given
for regular attendance by registered
students.

Bulletins for the summer school
may now be had at the registrar’s
office. . -

‘The last regular meeting of the stu-* 

dent senate under the new regime was“
held last Monday. Fourteen members
of the new senate were present.

A report of the Penn State Com-

mittee revealed the fact that neg-otia-' - ‘

tions regarding the matter of the play-
ing of the bands would be concluded
in the fall.

Chairman Armstrong then reported
on the Freshmen Rules. Last year’s
rules were recommended with two
changes: 1st, All freshmen should be
compelled to carry megaphones to var-
sity contests; 2nd, Smoking should be
prohibited in all buildings.

A motion was made by Arnowitz to
accept report. Motion carried.

The Cap committee reported through
the President that they had decided to
handle the sale in the book store.

The following resolution was then
read: “In consideration of the fact that
we believe suﬂici-ent publicity is given
candidates for oﬁice by the publication

of their names in the PITT WEEKLY, -

the posting of the ofﬁcial list on the
bulletin boards, and the printing of the
names on the ballot; and that posters
and advertisements for individual can-
didates are detrimental to the real
aims of elections, and usurp the places
of more important school notices; we,
the Student Senate of the University
of Pittsburgh, resolve that such meth-
ods of publicity should be discouraged.
To this end a copy of this resolution
shall be published in the PITT WEEK-
LY and included inthe notices for the
ensuing fall elections.’’ The resolu-
tion was passedoaftcr some discussion.

The Band Again‘

reetings, Band! You’re a sight for sore eyes.‘ Regardless of how
derful athletic teams may be reared in ourimidst, the majority of the
_nt body, have always harbored the sneaking idea that all was not well
‘sV-illustrated by strains of martial music from an organized bodyof nat-
uniformed musicians. Old Uni has certainly passeedthrough strange ex-
ces in their persistent efforts to locate said band. At times there. have
~~musicians in abundance, but no uniforms. Now, strange to tell, after
vering efforts on the part of Dr. Holder, the band is at last equipped
iuniforms——but there is only a small band. After such tireless energy
been expended looking toward the possession of a good well trained
iformedl band, one would think that anystudent who possessed even the
ow of a talent at blowing at horn or beating a cymbal would‘ be ashamed
efrain any longer from presenting himself to Dr. Holder and trying out
~he1 musical organization. .

his band, contrary to precedent, is really planning to do things. The
l3 ‘s are practicing faithfully, and better harmony and better music are
, vitable consequences of their toil. It is to be‘ on deckat every foot-

‘FINE SPEAKERS LIST

Indications point to the annual ban-

gquet held Commencement evening,
June 14, at 6:30, at the Hotel Schenley
..under the auspices of the General

Alumni Association, being the best at-

‘fair of its kind in Pitt’s long history.
I The general interest among graduates
and undergraduates is keen, indeed,

and everyone seems to be coming.
While the big ballroom at the Schen-

Jley will be taxed tocapacity, the hotel
management is going to prepare for an

overﬂow- Five thousand notices boost-
ing-this affai~r'hEave' been distributed
broadcast among alumni, faculty'mem-
bers, seniors and‘ others who are in-

terested. .

It is being emphasizedthat the ban-
quet is a University‘ ‘aﬁair, broadly
speaking, and that while it. is held
under the auspices ofthe Alumni As-
sociation,’ alumni, students, members
of faculty and friends of the Univer-
sity are cordially invited". It is to be

strictly informal and the ladies are

cordially invited‘.

A special eﬂert is being made to get-

members of the Senior class out as

b all who‘--attend will get afpaid up mem-
. , bership in the Alumni Association

until January 1‘, 1917 and will get the
PITT WEEKLY with it. This starts
them off right after they leave the
halls of Alma Mater, and the majority
of them usually renew their member-
ships. A letter explaining this, with
ticket order blank enclosed, has been
sent. to. every Senior in all depart-
ments, these“ letters in many cases
being distributed personally by the

Life Secretaries to their classmates.

The list of speakers will be com-
pleted this week when’ Secretary S. B.
Linhart ‘receives replies from several
of the distinguished guests who were
invitedto be present. T. H. B. Mc-
Knight, Assoc. Col, '81, is to ‘be toast-
master. Dr. John R. Wightman, a

V men1_be.r of the class of 1865 and one of

the oldest living alumni of Pitt, will
be one. of the speakers from the
alumni ranks. He will have some in-
teresting reminiscences of the Uni-
versity 50 years ago when he attended.
Although he must necessarily be class-
ed as an “Old Grad”, Dr.» Wightman

E lisa boy at heart, and his talk at the
banquet is sure to be very interesting I

to all. n , A  ,
E -J. Steele Gow, manager pr the var-

possibly three speakers from the list
of guests for the Commencement oc-
casion. Gus lS‘chnabel’s orchestra will
furnish the music, the “Old Guard”
willbe there to help with the singing,

MELLON INSTITUTE

One of the best summaries of the
work of the Mellon Institute for the
last year was given at a meeting of
the New York Section of the American
Chem-ical;Soc.iety on April, 7 by Dr.
Mars-ton Taylor Bogart, professor of
Organic Chemistry at ~ Columbia Uni-
versity. At the meeting, Professor
Bogert was one of the persons assign-
ed to discuss a paper by William H.
Nichols on “The-Industries and the
Universities”. In speaking of the Mel-
lon Institute, Professor Bogert said:

“The best proof that such work (in-

‘ ‘dustrialr_esearch) can-be done here is
i that much the same kind of work is

now being done with conspicuous suc-
ce‘s§'*in the applied science ﬁeld. by
the Mellon I-nstitutetof the University
of P—ittsburgh,gan admirably equipped
establishment,f founded by the princely
generosity of the“ Mel-lons -of Pitts-
burgh;l;~and, in the purescience ﬁeld
by, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, in the
Dahlein suburb of Berlin.

. “The success ofgthe Mellon Institute
has been phenomenal, far surpassing
the dreams of its””inost enthusiastic
supporters. Although its ﬁne new

* building was completed "but a year ago,
‘I it is already ﬁlled-to overﬂowing with
- industrial research fellows, and the

Director has announced that they can-
not accommodate any more. , Nearly
forty different fellowships are now in

0 operation there or have been arranged

for, occupying the attention of between
sixty and sev-enty graduate workers
gathered fromqall parts of the country,
for‘ the support of which the manufac-
turers will, s year contribute over
$130,000, with from $50,000 to $60,000

 additional’ offered in bonuses for the
7 ‘~ successful solution of certain of these

problems. The latest addition to this

6 industrial research institute, and it is a
‘ *signiﬁ_ca'nt one, is a professorship of

research in pure chemistry, to which

- chair Dr. Martin A. Rosanoﬁ-' has been
. called.” ‘ ‘ ’

Apart from the remarkable progress

- ofthe In‘dustrial”Fellowship System _at
x the Mellon Institute, the most signifi-
, cant fact in connection with the Insti-
;u.te has been the spread, of the System
, in other’universities-,,.: This has been
due, in, a -large measiure, , to the Euro-
- pean war, - for',it*"-has. brought home,
as nothing else; could, the necessity for

a practical system of co-operation be-

._.tween industries and the universities.

The close of the present academic
year marks the successful completion

of the ﬁrst year’s work of the School

of Chemistry as one “of the ..sépa‘rate
Schools of the University. The School
of Chemistry was organized last sum-
mer with Dr. R. F. Bacon as .dean,‘,and
in addition to continuing the work of
the old department of chemistry in the
College, has oﬁered a course intended
especially for those who plan to enter
chemistry as a profession, and leading
to the degree of Bachelor of Chemis-
tr .

}'rI‘he result of the ﬁrst year's work
has. been very encouraging. The teach-
ing» staff was enlarged by the addition
of two instructors, C’. W. Perkins in
organic ‘and Ralph Brenner in analy-
tical chemistry, G. T. Coleman, also
new to'th_e stat took A. A. C1egg’s
place as an instructor in inorganic
chemistry. Thirty students were; en-
rolled in the undergraduate school and

eight in the graduate. In addition in-
struction has been given to more than

500 students from other departments of
the University. That the School has
labored under a heavy handicap is evi-
dent from the fact that the laborator-
ies now occupied iwere originally
planned to accommodate 2-50 students.
Congested conditions have been slight-
ly relieved by enlarging the sup-ply
room and the organic laboratory. Dur-
ing the‘ year a series of weekly lec-
tures onvsubj-ects of interest to chem-
ists has been given by men connected
with the industries of the Pittsburgh
district. ,

' Members of the staff have devoted
considerable time to research in
addition to their regular teach-
ing duties, .and have‘ published
articles of interest. Among these
are .“The Silvering of. Glass”, written
by Prof. Alexander Silverman. and R.
M. Howe, and published in the Trans-

ciety: “Stoney Glass: Another Possible
Clause”, by Prof. Sillverman in: the
Transactions of the American Chemi-
cal Society and “The Value of the
Glass Chemist” in ‘the Glass Work-
er. Prof. Silverman has cduringthe
yeainlectured on “Glass” at the‘~Chica-
go,‘ Cleveland and Philadelphia sec-
tions of the American Chemical So-
ciety, at 'the,Atademy of science and
Art,_ Pittsburgh, and before ‘ the In-
dustrial Chemists and Chemical En-
gineers at the Convention. of the Amer-
ican Chemical Society at Urbanaglll.

tion, the enrollment of the School of

‘increase. The total registration for

last year, and 57 in 1910. The grad-
uating -class numbers 21, all of whom
have made arrangements to enter their
chosen life work soon after Com-
mencement. Two seniors who last
year hadcompleted all but some minor
requirements for graduation have been
pursuing graduation work and will be
awarded their Master’s degree at the
next degree-c-onferring period. Though
classrooms have been crowded and
facilities inadequate, the students as a
whole have cheerfully made the best
of these limitations and have. done
faithful, consistentowork. This year’s
new faculty members, -Messrs. Wood-
fhead, Kidd, Converse and Jones,‘
whose courses and teaching have
greatly broadened and enriched the
curriculum, have won the respect and
conﬁdence of -all. .. 0
Several changes in curriculum will
be made for next year. . Accounting
heretofore required of all freshmen
will be moved up to the sophomore
year; Political Science and Economic
Resources will each carry three cred-
its instead of two as heretofore. Phil-
osophy will become an elective sub-
ject for” upper-classmen and Psychol-
ogy will be open to sophomores. The
range of electives will be considerably
expanded, especially in commerce and
other courses which prepare for for-
eign «trade. Many positiﬂons were open
this year in the Government’s domes-
tic and foreign service, which promises
to become irfcreasingly attractive for

EDUCATION ‘

While ‘this has ‘been a year of
growth in enrollment, it has been
chieﬂy a., year of intensive, internal
development. All of the departments
of the school have given special at-
tentionto the better coordination of
their courses and their adjustment to
the demands for teachers from the
community. To mention any one de-
partment as having made special pro-
gress would be to do injusticeto the
other departments. ’ I I ‘

-The faculty in’ its meetings this
year has paid special attention to the
elimination of unnecessary ‘work and
the better coordinatioh of required
and elective courses. A number of
special faculty conferences have been
had -for the consideration of school
policies and practices.

The phases of our work which have
attracted most attention fromthe out-
side during the year have been the

cal Clinic, and our scheme“ of prac-
tice‘ teaching. All of these depart-
ments have been represented by one

tional meetings during the year. The
exhibits of the ‘Department of Fine
and Industrial Arts at Springﬁeld,

Michigan, in connection with Nationall
conventions elicited very favorable
comment. I The Department of Physi-
cal Education has aroused the inter-
est of the local community by its sev-
eral exhibits of esthetic dancing and
physical training. »

.Mor"e extension work in education
has been offered this year -than for a.
long time. Courses were given in
and near‘ the City of Pittsburgh -by
Professors Robertson, .Sies, Kirby and
Kniffin, land the boundaries of this
ﬁeld were pushed farther out than
ever before by means of‘ courses
given by Dr. Basset at Harrisburg and
Dean Chambers at Erie.

SWAMP um
    llME lllVAl3

Saturday our track men journeyed
to Washington, Pa., and completely
swamped the runners for the Red and
Black, 109 to 17. It was a complete
runaway for our men, allowing W. &

 

. J_.=:to get only one ﬁrst place by Wil-

son in the 220 yardhurdles. Although
Captain McMasters was kept at home
by examinations, our men had no diffi-
culty whatever in carrying away the
meet. In several events, the 100 yard
dash, the shot put, the 440 yard dash,
the high jump, the half mile run, and

the hammer throw, Pitt took all three

places in each, and allowed only a
third place to W. & J. in many of the
others.

Jack Sutherland was the star of
the meet, winning ﬁrst place in all
three of the weight events, and es-
tablishing a new W. & J. record in
the hammer throw, ﬂinging it 139 ft.
91;Qin,ches. Burwell annexed the 100
and 220 yard dashes, and Albright
themile run. DeHart captured two
seconds in the 100 and 200, follow-
ing closely on the heels of_ Burwell.
Sheehan won the broad jump and
Canan a second and third. These
were the principal point getters, al-
though all of the men were .in part
responsible for the victory.

Our men were not pushed any by
their opponents, so there were no
records broken.

Wilson was W. & J.’s high point
scorer, getting six points. The 220
yard hurdles, with ﬁve points, the dis-
cus with three points, and the broad
jump, with four points, were the only
events in which W. & J. was able to
get more than one point. They total-
ed only 1'7 points. The summary—

PlTT’S CHAMPION

RESUME OF SEASON -

Even six months after the close of
Pitt’s most successful football season,
it is diﬂicult to restnain the natural
thrill of enthusiasm that takes pos-
session of the interested observer
when an attempt is made to write a
critical resume of -the season. Even
a conservative analysis of the season's
accomplishments demonstrates, how-
ever, that in defensive and offensive
power, and because of the notable vic-
tories achieved, Pitt was in possession
of the best team in America at the
close of the 1915 season.

The distinct success scored during
the season may be attributed to four
fundamental factors. In the ﬂrst place
the effectiveness of the plays, the su-
perior morale of the squad during the
entire season, and the wonderful team
work that made possible every vic-

tory was directly due to the superla-

tive genius of Glenn S. “Pop” Warner,
our head coach. Of course it must be
admitted that Warner was fortunate
in having a wonderful aggregation of
material whi-ch was another factor in
the success of the season but material
alone cannot make a team. To the
untiring eﬁorts of Capt. Chalky Will-
iamson too much praise can scarce be
accredited. Finally the management
that left nothing undone for the for-
warding of the ultimate object of the
season comes in for its share of the
glory.

A review of the season would nat-
urally result in the division of the
season intotwo different classes of
games. Penn State, Annapolis and W.
& J. were the major games of interest
w.hile the rest, Carlisle, Westminster,
Allegheny, and Tech can be classed
among the less important contests.

The Annapolis game was one of the
distinct surprises of the season. That
any team should be able to force such
a humiliating defeat on a Navy eleven,
however weak, was a tremendous ar-
gument for the strength of the victor-
ious aggregation.

The Penn game was the critical con-
test of the season. It was. Pitt’s debut
into the exclusive athletic ring of «the
East and it was important that a good
showing be made before the eyes of
the critics of that section. The team
was at its lowest ebb of condition of
the season and failed to roll up the
score against the Quakers that un-
doubtedly would have resulted had the
team been on edge. This failure to
administer a crushing defeat to Penn
was one of the factors that inclined
to favor Cornell for the championship
honors, especially after the Big Red
team had overwhelmed the 'Phillies in
the ﬁnal games of theseason.

It may be safely asserted that the
Penn game displaced the W. & J.
clash as the important game of the
season, in fact State preceded the
Washingtonians in the point of im-
portance. Indeed the affair of this
year despite the stir it created was
surrounded by little more than local
interest. The decisive win over the
Red and Black machine was a source"
of much gratiﬁcation to. the Blue and
Gold supporters who regarded it as a
victory really achieved a year before
-but de-ferred a twelve month in reali-
zation. From a -tactical point of view
this contest was interesting for it es-
tablished the fact that Warner was
possessed of the ability to build up a
great defensive as well as a potential
offensive team, the defensive work
against W. & J.’s forward pass be-
ing nothing short of marvelous.

In many respects the State game
was -the most gruelling contest of the
entire season. The men entered the
play with the determination to win
but under all was the desire to pile
up a larger score against them than
had Harvard. In both these particu-
lars the efforts of the men were
crowned with success. In no other
game of the season was the powers of
the team taxed so heavily and the man-
ner in which they responded to the
demand was responsible for the win.
This game presented more conclusive-
ly than ever the sterling qualities of

BALL EAMIZS AND
MEET WITH STATE

The baseball games and the track
meets with Penn State next week are
the closing events in the sporting cal-
ender of the University. Of course
this is excepting the Titanic struggle
that will ensue when the Varsity and
the Alumni line up against each other
for their annual baseball game. These
events are all scheduled for the first
three days of next week and then
Pitt will be off the sport map until the
fall when the call of the gridiron is
heard and we all journey up to Wind-
her to see the men getting ready to
take the scalps of the teams on their
schedule.

The Track meet with the Mt. Nit-
tany crew that will be held Monday
at State -College promises to be one
of the best meets of any kind that has
ever been held between the two in-
stitutions. Pitt has rapidly come to
the front in track and whereas last
year we were expectionally weak, now
this season sees us up contending for
premier honors in this part of the
state. Pitt has never, in -the past
been on a par with the Center Count-
ains in this line of sport and for the
ﬁrst time in the history of the sport
Pitt will go up to the meet as the fav-
orite. This reaction has been due
largely to the inﬂux into the Univer-

 

H sity this year of some of the best

athletes that the University has ever
No less than sixteen
new men have shown to be point win-
ners their first year here. This has
been the basis of the wonderful swing
that we have compiled.

BALL TEAM Wlll
JllllllNE_l_lll STATE

It's always a consolation to look
forward to the future rather than back
upon the past, especially when you
take a look at the record hung up by
the_ ‘Panther representatives on the
diamond. Of the eleven games played
thus far four have been won and the
remainder (ﬁgure it out for yourself)
have not. _But “wait till next year”.
Oh, yes, we’ll have one next year all
rumors and knockers notwithstanding.
When a bad season comes along all
the knockers get out their little ham-
mers and——but what’s -the use. The
loyal supporters have had their inning
and the enemy have been put to
ﬂight.

The ﬁrst defeat was handed us by
that bunch from Syracuse but then
came two to the credit side when
both Lafayette and Tech bit the dust.
This was before the disastrous eastern
“invasion” and lent hope to the fans
that we again had a champion baseball
team. But the results came in fast
that every where the Pantherites were
being driven back and could not with-

stand the ﬁrst of the enemy, Gettys-
burg, Lafayette, Army, Navy, and
Bucknell all turning the trick in rapid
succession. On the home stand they
{took one from Westminster and let
State get away with the next one. It
-certainly was a shame to beat Tech
again but we needed every little game
we could get on the right side of the
column.

Hastings -as an offensive _and defens-
ive player and brought to light the

tremendous possibilities that would be"

realized in the development of Mc-
Laren the young full back. ,
Among the minor games Carlisle
stood out prominently because of the
glamor that yet surrounded them out
of their pristine glory. The only

object that the team had in the game,

was to administer a worse heating to
them than they had suffered at the
hands of -Harvard, in which object
they were eminently successful.
further demons-trated that it was the

genius of Warner and -not the quali- ‘

ties of the Indians themselves that
placed the Carlisle men on the high
plane they had been wont to occupy.

The Tech affair was among the
hardest con-tested of the minor clashes
but there was not a moment when the
outcome was the least bit in doubt
and there was but once or twice when
the Plaids had the least chance of
scoring.

Allegheny and Westminster were
the easiest games, the latter having
but small interest except as a means

‘of trying out the new Warner com-

bination.

The Allegheny game cast a distinct
gloom over the Pitt supporters, how-
ever, not so much because of its own
importance as because of the fact that
the Blue and Gold aggregation seemed
helpless before an aerial attack but
one week before the W. & J. contest.

When thought is taken of the chan-
ces for next year it must be said that
the appearances are all for the best.
Very few men are lost to the 1915
combination. There can be no doubt
that Williamson and Shapira will be
very much missed, bu-t to all intents
it is not a irreparable one and it is
expected that, with the men who come
up from the Freshman squad the 1916
team will be able to present as strong
a front as ever.

Indeed when a glance. is «taken at the
schedule for the coming season there
is need that the team he a strong one.

This year we have ﬁve big games in-.

ever, that this year Warner was
obliged to uncover little of his re-

little doubt of the success of the seas-

  ii TENNIS

The much heralded Syracuse tennis
cracks did not" line up to advance
notices when they undertook to add
tennis tothe-list of -‘sports in which
the New Yorkers have proved them-
selves superior to the Pitt representa-
tives. The match was one of the

_easiest.of the season for the Blue and

Gold and they came out with only one
scratch, that was the last double

. match in which Norton and Osborne

defeated .Sd1ith -and Myers.

The matches were held on the Traf-
ford _courtQ',; Thursday afternoon be-
cause -Syracuse.~failed.to- reach town in

_ time to hold the matches on the P.

A. A. courts‘ "in the _morning. The

V Pantherites showed -the best form of

the year and there waslno doubt that
at last Pitt had; found at least one
vulnerable spot‘ in the athletics of the
Empire Staters. ’

Mohn took the ﬁrst match in two
sets though he was forced to go into
extra games to -take the ﬁrst one.
Spindler had no trouble at all in dis-
posing Norton, losing only four games
during‘ the match. ” South also took
his match in straight‘ sets, but Myers
experienced a little difficulty when he
bucked up against Osborne. He took
the ﬁrst set easily‘ enough -but his
opponent came.back in the second and
captured it in extra games. Myers
came back in the third and made it
a clean sweep of the singles for the
Pittmen.

Mohn and Spindler had no opposi-
tion in their doubles winning with
ease in two straight sets. South and
Myers lost a tough match to Norton
and Osborne. They run close in the
first set and were just nosed out in
the ﬁnal games, but they captured the
second in handy fashion. The Syra-
cuse racqueters then proceeded to sew
up the match though the Pittites
fought hard to make it a clean sweep
of all the matches.

current school year and the ﬁnal num-

ber will come out to-morrow, bringing
to a close the second year of the exist-
ance of this activity. Last year the
Panther was published four times.
This year it has been published twice

twice as humorous. T 1

?Next‘ year the Panther will con
tinue to come out as amonthly maga-
zine.
and bigger than ever. I V .

The work will be done for the most
part by the present editorial and busi-

PITTSBURGH, PA:

The publication lWlJll’be better T

In the dashes will be represented-
by Burwell, Miller--.an_d DeHa.rt.  All
these men are good at this diwstancpe
and Pitt should be sure of ﬁrst place
and perhaps with a chance for a sec-
ond or third. The same holds true in
the 220 yard dash. In the 440 it looks
as if Pitt will have to -take second
honors. But at that we have many
good men at this distance and al-
though they may not take ﬁrst place
still they should render a good ac-
count of them~selves. In the half mile
Coach Kerr will enter two of the fast-
est half milers that there are in the
western part of the state, Grumbling
and Sebright. It was hoped that Al-
bright could be run against the half
mile Jrecord at V7. & J . but due to the
condition of the track this was found
to be inadvisable. Albright will also
run the mile and should further low-
er the University record for that dist-
ance. V . _ ” I .

The two miles will be taken care
of by Livermore ‘V and Wiegle. Both
these men are fast and should hold up
th_e honors of .-Pitt. The weight events
are the strong points for us.) In these

we will have all the advantage and

along with the other ﬁeld. ‘events they
should prove to be.suﬂ‘lcie11t to Over-
come the .advantage tVhat'Penn' State
will -probably run -up in the’ track
events. The one vtraiskesvent that the
State menare good in is ‘the hurdles.
‘They are certainly good, in these

all the places. V V _

The baseball games with Penn State
will decide. the championship of the
western part of the state as State has

already won outVI over  & J. Al-

though i‘t'lOoks_as..though Pitt will
have little chan-ceagainstpthe upstat-
ers still it was the same thing last

year and it will -be remembered that

Pitt twice shut out the champion, state
team. lWhether they will be able to
repeat this year againor notiis merely
a_ question. . ‘

The election of the baseball and
track captains will be held immediate-
ly after-the completion of these con-
tests. Announcement will be made in
