Druids Tap Four
Sophomore Men
At Fall Smoker

Logan Armory Affair Wednesday
Introduces Freshman Men
To Campus Activities

Sutherland Is Speaker

At the fall tapping ceremony of
Druids, held in conjunction with the
annual Druid Smoker in the Logan
Armory VVednesday evening, Frank

Souchak, C38. Stephen Goodale, E38,
Samuel ‘Werlinich, BA38, and David
Grossma.n, BA38, were named to this
sophomore honorary.

Souchak, who was recently signaled
out as one of the sophomore stars of
1935 by the “Illustrated Football An-
nual,” a national All-America football
review, will undoubtedly play varsity
end on the 1935 football team. Dur-
ing his freshman year, Frank starred
on both the grid and track teams.

Goodale was honored for his work
on the 1935 Owl, participation in Cap
and Gown, and cheerleading.

For his scholastic average of 2.12
and extracurricular activity on the
1935 Owl, Cap and Gown publicity.
and membership in the PBI council,
Werlinich was the third ﬁrst-semester
sophomore to be chosen.

As an apprentice manager for the
football squa.d and for work on the
business staff of the Owl and Cap and
Gown, Grossman was also tapped.
The election meeting for the selec-
tion of these four outstanding second-
year men was held at the Delta Tau
Delta house on Tuesday evening.

The Druid‘ Smoker, featuring Dr.
John B. Sutherland, varsity football
coach, in his initial appearance be-
fore the freshman class was a com-
plete success, Vvednesday evening.
An effort to interest the freshmen in
activities was met well by the ﬁrst-
year men with every indication of a
high percentage entering the activity
ﬁeld during the present school year.

In addition to Sutherland’s talk,
speeches were offered by “Doc” Carl-
son, popular ﬂoor mentor, Frank
Engel, C38, Druid president, and Carl
Cass, assistant professor of English.
Selections by the"Glee Club and trom-
bone quartets offered variety to the
program with their musical interludes.
Refreshments and cigarettes were
served during the course of the even-
1110.

Tentative initiation arrangements
have been set for Sunday, October 13,
according to Paul Kohberger. C38, so-
cial chairman. The Delta chapter of
Druids reaches a new high for active
membership with a total of 18 mem-
bers, three more than the regular 15
of the 14-year period, previous to Jan-
uary of this year.

Debating Tryout
Period Arranged

Men In Four Classes Requested
To Appear Wednesday

Wednesday afternoon at 12:30
o’clock, ﬁrst tryouts for the Men’s
Debating Association will be held in
Room 308, Alumni Hall, Dr. W. M.
Parrish, coach of the team, announced
yesterday.

Both freshmen and upperclassmen
are invited to prepare ﬁve-minute
speeches on one side of the question,
“Resolved, That a System of Social-
ized Medicine Should Be Introduced
in the United States.”

Although the topic set has not been
deﬁnitely agreed upon for the entire
year, Dr. Parrish said that it will be
used for early-season extension and
intercollegiate debating. Members of
the squad are annually chosen from
their work in tryout speeches.

Managing this year will be done by
Frank Doeringer, who will handle
local and extension intramural ‘con-
tests, and Israel Goldberg, who is in
charge of the intercollegiate program.
Tentative plans include twoscore or
more affairs in the city, and at least
two trips. One is projected into the
South or the Southwest, the other into
the East.

“Three of the four men who repre-
sented the University on major trips
last year have graduated,” Dr. _Parrish
said. “Therefore we have openings
on our varsity team for men inter-
ested in platform'work.” High school
experience, he added, is not necessary
for either freshman or varsity par-
ticipation.

Coach of the freshman team will be
Charles VV. Lomas, a graduate of
Northwestern University who re-
places Richard Murphy, now at Cor-
nell University.

 

Four Promotions Made
In Business School Staff

Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, dean of the
School of Business Administration,
announces four new staff promotions
for this fall.

Dr. Carroll R. Daugherty, formerly
assistant professor of economic re-
search, has been given a full profess-
orship. '

Miles H. Jones, Dr. Asher Isaacs,
and Clarence L. Van Sickle, formerly
assistant professors of business law,
economics, and accounting, respective-
ly, have been appointed associate pro-
fessors.

First Assembly
Meeting Planned

Vacancy In SFA Executive Group
To Be Filled Next Tuesday

Student Faculty Assembly will ac-
quire a new member, a new executive
committee member, and a new treas-
urer at its first meeting next Tuesday.

Because Marguerite Swank, former-

at the University Club next Tuesday
at 6:30 o'clock. The committee will
meet the next day to elect a treasurer
to succeed Miss Swank.

According to an agenda distributed
by the oﬁice of the dean of men, re-
ports will be requested concerning so-

Collegiate? Not
Bert Nevin, ’83,
Says Biography

By Robert Saffron

“There was nothing collegiate about
Bert Nevin,” says John Tasker How-
ard in his recently published biogra-
phy, “Ethelbert Nevin,” referring to
the famous musician's year at the
University.

The author of “Mighty Lak a Rose,”
“The Rosary,” “Narcissus_."’ and other
well-known works, Ethelbert Nevin
entered WUP in 1879, but left a year
later to devote his time to music.

“He was always companionable
among friends, but one cannot picture
him as comfortable on a college cam-

pus nor was he a remarkable
academic student,” his biographer
adds.

Mr. Howard, who is also author of
a widely-read “Life of Stephen C. Fos-
ter,” expresses his particular grati-
tude in the preface to Chancellor John
G. Bowman; Mrs. Ruth Crawford
Mitchell, who had charge of the gath-
ering of material for the Nationality
Rooms in the Cathedral; and Mrs.
Mildred Stegeman and Miss Emma
Wolfel, who copied for Howard’s ref-
erence the several hundred Nevin let-
ters in the University collection.

The Nevin memorabilia, to be placed
in the proposed Ethelbert Nevin
Memorial Room, are the most com-
plete extant. They include the com-
poser’s piano and studio furnishings.
42 of his original manuscripts, and
many of his personal possessions.

Kramer, Sobleoviak Get
Military Merit Awards

Paul E. Kromer, C37, and Joseph L.
Sobkoviak, E38. have been awarded
the gold medal for merit in the basic
courses the department of military
science. Kromer was a. member of
the ﬁrst year basic course and Sobko-
vial; was a second year basic student.

The ﬁrst year basic silver medal
was awarded to Arthur C. Kelley. C37,
and the bronze medal went to Vfilliam
M. iVlarkle_v, C37, who, incidentally,
was recently presented with the Chi
Rho Nu plaque in recognition of
merit in the pre-medical department.

The second year basic silver medal
was won by James R. Hoon, C36.
Rhenar L. Freeburg, E38, was pre-

 

sented with the bronze medal.

Panthers Tangle
With Waynesburg
In Season Opener

Four Sophomores Are Expected
To Start Against Wolfpack;
End Position Undecided

Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o’clock,
Coach Jock Sutherland’s football
eleven makes its 1935 debut before dis-
trict football fans, meeting a determin-
ed bunch from Waynesburg College
at the Stadium. .

A crowd of approximately 10,000
spectators is expected to watch the
Panthers in the ﬁrst of a gruelling
10-game schedule which will keep
them stepping until the second week
in December.

With his ‘starting lineup tentative-
ly selected except for the right end
post, where either Eddie Quarantillo
or the veteran Vin Sites will start,
Coach Sutherland will send on the
ﬁeld a team mixed with a sprinkling
of experienced gridders and of untried
sophomores.

Paired at the terminal positions will
be Frank Souchak, husky yearling
star from Berwick, Pa., and either
Sites or Quarantillo. Souchak will
hold down the left end post while one
of the other two possible starters will
get the call at right end. The veteran,
Verne Baxter, is still on the injured
list and will probably be withheld
from competition. Both Sites and
Quarantillo are varsity lettermen but
have never held ﬁrst team jobs.
Souchak will be playing in his first
college game as a varsity performer.

At tackles the probable starters will
be Averill Da11iell, 195-pound junior
letterman, and George Delich, another
190-pound youth, who will be getting
his lll'St taste of collegiate competi-
tion. Daniell, a junior, saw plenty of
service last season, alternating with
Bobby Hoel at left tackle. Art Detzel
and Tony Matisi will be used in the
relief roles.

Fraternity ‘Co-op’
Continues Work

Buying Association Head Shows
Membership Advantages

Under the direction of the dean of
men's staff, the Cooperative Buying
Association of men’s social fraterni-
ties begins this semester its fourth
year of operation.

Supervised by N. Robert Seidle, as-
sistant to the dean, and managed by
Samuel Strauss, L35, the organization
features advantages of wholesale pur-
chasing for men’s houses on campus.
Under the system, dealers in fuel.
foods, and household equipment make
contracts with the association rather
than with individual groups.

“Tliere is no doubt that we are sav-
ing money for fraternities which buy
through us,” Strauss said yesterday.
He produced a chart which showed
comparative prices of chain stores
and the “Co-op” on canned goods. On
the same day, he pointed out, a chain
was selling fruit salad at 33 cents a
can, while fraternities could buy the
same grade at 24 cents.

Competitive business houses, the
manager warned, have attempted
through various devices, such assimi-
larity of firm name, to make fraterni-
ties buy outside the cooperative.
“Several stewards have been taken in
by these maneuvers,” he said. “Any
who doubt the savings of our associa-
tion may verify them at our oﬂiqe.”

Hundreds Say ‘Hyah’ At CA
‘Howdy Hop’; Kaiser Beams

 

Green Armbands, Buttons, Draw Upperclassmen’s Eyes,
Attention; Big Informal At Grotto Friday
Gets Free Plug; Eichler To Play

 

By Special Correspondent

Paul Keiser, C36, whom the cabinet
of the College Association calls
“Boss,” “Chief,” or “Hey, you," ac-
cording to mood, has political aspira-
tions.

Back home in Shamokin, in the
wilds of the Anthracite coal industry
and coal bootlegging industry, the
Keisers rate p0l.lLl.Ca.Uy. Pa.ul raised
the family escutcheon yet another
notch last spring by .-dying up enough
votes to win his present presidency

III the College Association. He hopes
to go further.
Wednesday afternoon the Hotel

Schenley resembled a pre-election
rally, what with much good feeling
passing about with abandon. Keiser,
whose College Association has spon-
sored a "Howdy Hop,” was beaming
like a favored candidate, as hundreds
of men and women from all classes.
all stages, trooped in to dance away
the sunshine and to give freshmen
the proverbial break of meeting and
dinu.-ing with the more beautiful or
more handsome upperclassmen.

Then l{eiser’s chief publicity agent,
Chuck Holstein, C36, made a nervou.~:
speech in which Keiscr’s acumen and
the College Associations ﬁ1"s.*. big
dance of the year, the “Kickoll lil-
formal,” scheduled for next Friday
night, were generally extolled.

The informal will get under way :12‘
9 o’clock, a week from tr.-night, .,f
the large Grotto ballroom on the
Nortlisicle. Fran Eichlei-’s ten-piece
orchestra has been booked, tickets are
on sale, and committee members are
lzusuy selling them in a11 effort to
earn “comps.” (Comps, in-cidentally.
are the nicest things about college

lie, freshmen, if your upperclassmen
counselors have forgotten to men-
tion them to you.)

Undoubtedly the most inexpensive
major social affair in recent Univer-
sity history, the CA irformal next
Friday IS priced at $1 per couple.

This is the ﬁrst year that the or-
gsanization has sold tickets individu-
ally for the two big dances it spon-
sors each semester.

The College Associaticn besides as-
suming the appearance of a mere
dance group, brings prominent speak-
ers to campus at intervals to address
students in the College on important
questions of the day. It also con-
ducts a loan fund of needy students
in the College, the money for which
is earned through the four dances it
runs each year.

Students in all schools are per-
mitted to attend College Association
affairs.

Tickets for the informal are on sale
in the office of the College, Room 201,
State Hall, in the office of the dean
of men. Room 801, Cathedral, and with
individual members of the cabinet.
Included on the cabinet are: Keiser,
Holstein, William Hughes, ’36, social
chairman, Martha Fuller, ’38, Anne
June Elmer, ’36, Elinore Humphries,
’37, Lucy Conn, ’38, Ted Vvhitaker, ’38,
Paul Kohberger, ’38, Doris Evans, ’37,
Edwin Beachler. ’37, Edward Durkin,
’36, and Beverly Brown, ’37.

A sketchy ﬁnancial report of the
Hop indicates a. proﬁt approaching
860. according to Treasurer Ted
Vxfliitaker and Keiser. Bill Daufen-
bach, who took tickets, pronounced it
the most successful affair of its type
in ten years. About 500 attended.

Fraternities Meet
In First Council;
‘Joe’ Louis Wins

Discussions On Housing Contracts,
Banquet, Smoker, Bonﬁre Are
Prizeﬁght Preliminaries

Probably the most important item
discussed at the opening dinner meet-
ing of 24 Interfraternity Councilmen
in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house
Tuesday concerned the possibilities
of one Maxie Baer against one Joe
Louis at Madison Square Garden that
night.

It is true that some interest was
taken in housing contracts, fraternity
banquets, smokers, and even an oc-
casional bonﬁre. But, like the mad-
cap Maxie, council failed to land a
single solid punch in its ﬁrst round
meeting of the year.

There was no visible “Brown Bom-
ber” present, with the result that 12
social houses failed to connect on
even one wild swing. President Dur-
kin, C36, Kappa Sigma, called the
meeting to order “with the hopes of
presenting plans for the coming year.”
Joe Humphries adjourned the gather-
ing promptly at 10 o’clock before any
of these plans could come out of their
corners.

Bill Andrews, C36, SAE, pinch-l1it-
ting for Morris Rosenbloom, BA36, Pi
Lambda Phi, in the secretarial role,
reviewed the executive committee’s
appointments for the year. It was an-
nounced that Frank Frederick, C36,
Theta Chi, would be chairman of the
Interfraternity Ball, with A. W.
Schenck, BA36, Phi Gamma Delta,
serving as chairman of the ﬁrst in-
formal dance.

William Housel, C37, Delta Tau
Delta, and Harry Zinsser, Med38,
Sigma Chi, will handle the athletic
co-chairmanship. Ralph Appel, BA36,
of Pi Kappa Alpha, will be chairman
of Interfraternity Conference week.
Joseph Rodgers, BA36, of Phi Kappa,
was appointed Interfraternity rush-
ing chairman.

Motions Moved in Vain

As to the business itself, William
Harvey, C36, Delta Tau Delta, intro-
duced a motion on the ﬂoor to send
out letters urging freshmen interested
in pledging a fraternity to serve im-
medi_ately a 30-day notice for leaving
rooming houses; motion was defeated,
6-5. Again Harvey moved for his
letter suggestion. This time the mo-
tion was tabled by Durkin at the sug-
gestion of N. Robert Seidle, assistant
dean of men.

The tentative freshman rushing
banquet scheduled for Wednesday, Oc-
tober 2, in the “Pitt Compass,” was
called off’ after a vote of 8 to 3 on the
motion. The uncertainty of a sub-
stantial return in proportion to the
contemplated expense was the con-
census of opinion offered by eight
houses and appeared to be the pri-
mary reason for dropping the project.
Anyhow it was almost “ﬁght time.”

Then, with a rider tacked on to the
tabled letter motion, eight houses

School, and the Downtown Division,
Quick revealed.

When the registration offices closed.

"Vednesday evening, the total number
of men and women enrolled in the
freshman class was 1,001. “This ﬁg-
ure, too, is incomplete,” stated the
registrar. “Freshmen are continuing
to enroll. It now appears that the
class. of 1939 will establish a total
comparable to that of last year’s fresh-
man class. The ﬁnal ﬁgure will like-
ly show a difference of one or two per
cent either way.”

In the School of Engineering the
enrollment of 436 betters last year’s
enrollment on the same date, 430.
The increase of registrants to the
School of Mines showed a rise from
95 last year to 146.

Equally marked was the increase
shown by enrollment in the Graduate
SchooL
dean of the School, will have 834 grad-
uates receiving instruction this year
as against the total of 670 last year.
It is highly probable that the present
ﬁgure will be augmented by additional
registrations in the Graduate School,
Quick averred.

Records of the Downtown Division
already reveal an increase of 193 reg-
istrants over last year’s 1,492 mark.
The present enrollment totals 1,685.

The largest enrollment iii the his-
tory of the School of Mines and the
second largest of the School of En-
gineering were recorded.

This great increase in the number of
freshmen who want to be mine ex-
perts gives the school the largest
number of students since its institu-
tion in 1895, said Dr. E. A. Holbrook,
dean of the Schools of Engineering
and Mines.

In the School of Engineering, this-
year runs second in enrollment to the
record high year 1930.

According to Dr. Holbrook, the in-
creases this year may be traced toa
lenewed iron and steel activity in the
Pittsburgh district which has created
a demand for metallurgists, and to a
greater use of technical men in petro-
leum and gas companies.

Quite a few students were going
through the process of late registra-
tion yesterday and more are expected
to do so today, indicated the registrar,

Rooters Get Chance

NEYV AND UNTRIED Panther team will

take tl1e ﬁeld tomorrow to meet \Vaynesburg

College in the opening football game of the
local season.

It is generally conceded that the Panthers will
have too much in sheer man power to cause any
doubt as to the outcome of the game. The score
may be close, or it may not be close. In the event
that it is not close, there may be a tendency‘ on the
part of the Pitt cheering sections to sit back and
munch chocolate-covered ice cream, satisﬁed that
their cheers are not needed.

That will be a mistake. The boys down on the
ﬁeld have been hard at work for three weeks, prac-
ticing their formations and shifts and adjusting
their timing. Yet there is not one of t iem who will
“ease up” at any time tomorrow afternoon. The
battle for positions on the ﬁrst eleven will guaran-
tee that.

The possibility that the cheering section will be
able to “ease up” tomorrow seems very unlikely
by comparison. The student rooters will be group-
ed together for the ﬁrst time. They have had no
weeks of practice sessions in cheering; this will be
the ﬁrst. It is obvious that the student sections
should put forth extra efforts in order to acquaint
themselves with the ma.nner in which University
songs and cheers and stunts are used. ’

For that reason, it is urged that all students sit
in the cheering sections tomorrow and give their
full cooperation to the cheerleaders throughout the
game. Several new cheers and songs are to be in-
troduced this season. These will not, and some of
the old ones may not, come off perfectly the first
time. The need of frequent repetition to correct
mistakes should not be trying to those cheering.

A lot of conscientious work will have to be done
if the Pitt cheering sections are to give the VVest
Point cadets as much of a battle as we expect our
football team to give the Army down on the ﬁeld
early in November.

Lanterns And Loyalty

F THERE were some sort of gadget which could regis-
ter for each freshman woman the intensity of her
loyalty to the University, it would doubtless record its
highest mark as the coed, dressed in white, walked
away after Wednesday’s Lantern Night ceremony.

_ Lantern Night is a tradition which, in a sense, deﬁes
tradition. Rather than continue, year after year, each
part of the ceremony in strict repetition, those in charge
of this tradiion have looked ahead far enough to observe
that a ceremony which has not reached its highest point
of excellence is not unalterable.

There is little doubt but that preparations for the cere-
mony are no easy task. Painstaking efforts, repeated
rehearsals, and careful planning are required of those
participating. But there can be no one who would regret
those eﬁorts and those rehearsals and that planning if
she could stand on a corner asthe new coeds go away
from that ceremony and hear their expressions of appre-
ciation as they pass by.

Something is behind that event other than a string of
lanterns winding evenly up a campus hill. The Univer-
sity needs more of that something.

Pitt Personals

The Pitt Band has George W. Gehres, student leader
of last year, back with them as assistant director. George
is on the campus working for his Master’s degree.

   

Camp Hamilton, noted for its football workouts and
extra-large menus, has another point in its favor. While
helping Frank Carver get out the football publicity this
year, William McJunkin, BA’39, learned the unique
practice of holding a typewriter on his lap.

Betty Quarrie, chosen Alma Mater
at the University tap day ceremonies
in 1934, was chosen deﬁnitely by Wil-
liam Piggott to be Mrs. William Pig-
gott this summer. Mrs. Pigott is a
member of Kappa Kappa Gamma and
as an undergraduate held several
leading roles in Pitt Players shows.
Her husband, a graduate of the same
University class, was a member of
Delta Tau Delta and also active in
Pitt Players. The two formed one of
the most popular campus couples.

Andy Sable, Cathedral elevator op-
erator, has made three trips to the
coast over the Thumb route to see
Pitt’s Panthers play football. Once in
a while someone still mentions the Christmas cards
Andy sent to University officials last year. The name
“Andy” and two arrows, one pointing up and one point-
ing down, was the signature on the cards.

Mrs. Piggott

Johnny Holbrook, who graduated from the School of
Engineering two years ago, was one of the most active
participants in Freshman Camp last weekend. It was
this same fellow who started the first of these camps for

years.

Betty Jane Martin, graduate of Donora High School
last year, has come to Pitt on an honor scholarship.
Betty Jane is the niece of Malcolm Parcell, a noted por-
trait painter of \Vashington, Pa.

Another honor scholar of the class of ’39 is Sally
Fogle who hails from Mt. Lebanon High School.

Kenneth K. Gust, of Glassport, comes to Pitt with an
envious journalistic record to his credit. Ken was edi-
tor-in-chief of “Hy-Lyf,” oﬁicial publication of Glassport
High, that won First Class Honors in the National School
Press Association last year.

Will Play Tomorrow

At the Waynesburg game tomorrow,
come early and~keep your eyes on
the Pitt Band.

The men are already in mid-season
form from weeks of early practice and
drills, and a half hour before game-
time they threaten to perform as well
as either of the football teams. They
are ready to march with a new assort-
ment of formations and tactics, in-
cluding novel Pitt “P’s” and Waynes-
burg “W’s,” while they “Hail to Pitt”
in music.

What's more, there will be two
bands to watch instead‘ of one.

About 130 high school musicians
from the greater Pittsburgh area will
be on hand to represent Waynesburg.
This group holds practices Saturday
mornings in the Cathedral and will
represent all visitors who do not bring
bands with them to Pitt home games.

Due to the large number of appli-
cants this year, there is also a “B”
organization.

The regular 120—piece band is larger
than that of any other eastern college.

Lee M. Lockhart, director of the
University Band, yesterday praised
the Freshman Ba11d that made its ini-
tial appearance at VVSGA’s Lantern
Night Wednesday.

“With the calibre of freshman
players,” he says, “there is no doubt
that the University musical organiza-
tion is on the upgrade.”

Mr. Lockhart also repeated his in-
vitation for freshmen who have had
no previous musical instructions to
enter the Freshman Unit in order to
be eligible for Band membership as
upperclassmen. A note mailed to him,
in care of the University Band, is sug-
gested for further information.

globe designed by Copernicus in the
sixteenth century to illustrate his as-
tronomical theories should have been
ﬁnished and ready for the Cathedral's
Polish nationality room this summer.

But when Polish master workers had
practically ﬁnished the reproduction,

they suddenly discovered that Coper-
nicus had ﬁxed a little gear mechan-
ism into the original globe to set it in
motion.

Complete now with the gear mech-
anism, the globe replica is due to be
shipped here on October 6. The orig-
inal still stands in the Jagiellonian
library at the University of Cracow
where Copernicus studied for many
years, The reproduction was made

possible by a gift of $1,000 from the
Polish National Alliance, and is to be
placed in the bay window of the
Polish nationality room of the Cathe-
dral.

Dr. T. A. Starzynski, chairman of
the committee for the Polish room,
left for New York this week to dis-
cuss further plans for the design of
the room with Dr. Leopold Kotnowski,
president of the Polish-American
Chamber of Commerce, who arrived
here recently as a guest on the initial
cruise of the new Polish steamer,
“Pilsudski.”

Actual construction on the 17 na-
tionality rooms is expected to get un-
der way next summer. The rooms, to
be used as regular classrooms after
completion, will be grouped around
the Common Rooms on the ﬁrst floor
of the Cathedral and will be decorated
and furnished by interested national-
ity groups.

Mendenhall, secretary of the YMCA.

The affair is sponsored by all the
churchesgof the community, supplant-
ing the separate receptions formerly
held by the individual churches. Dr.
C. Marshall Muir, of the Belleﬁeld
Presbyterian Church, is chairman of
the committee in charge.

Students of all religions are invited.
Representatives will be present from
the University, Carnegie Tech, POW,
Duquesne, and Mount Mercy. Repre-
senting the University on the general
committee are Chalmers Brown, Ed37,

and Martha Marsh, Ed36.

Admission is free, and refreshments
will be served. The Tech Band, the
University Quartet, a drama group
from Tech, and additional features
from Duquesne, Mount Mercy, and
PCW are included as entertainment.

Any student having brothers, sis-

nounced that children's tickets, priced
at 25 cents, plus a 1 cent state tax,

All approved Pitt ticket agencies will

Fraternity Rushing Will Begin On Thursday

Rushing for men's social fraterni-
ties will officially open next Thursday
morning at 8 o'clock, one-half hour
earlier than in previous seasons.

The rushing rules for the ﬁrst
semester, as adopted by Interfrater-
nity Council and approved by the Uni-
versity Fraternity Committee, show
several important changes from pre-
vious year's rules. Headlining the
changes is Rule 5, which prescribes
that coincident with the close of the
regular silence or bidding period on
October 21, the fraternities may not
pledge or issue invitations to pledge-
ship to newly-registered students for
a period of one month. This means
that students not pledged during the
regular bidding season may not be in-
vited to membership until one month
has elapsed.

According to N. Robert Seidle, as-
sistant to the dean of men in charge
of men’s social fraternities, the pri-
mary reason for the inclusion of this
rule is to permit those social frater-
nities which sponsor a deﬁnite period
of pledge training to begin the course
early and to continue it without the
interruptions caused by new pledges
coming in during all stages of the
training.

Changes have also been made in the
scholastic requirements necessary be-

fore pledges may be eligible for initi-
ation.

In addition, the period of rushing
has been extended by one day. The
total number of rushing days is now

ten.
A detailed list of the rushing rules

follows:

1. No member or members. pledge or pledges,
of a fraternity, directly or indirectly, shall
approach on fraternity matters, invite to fra-
ternity premises or entertain in any way
whatsoever any new students prior to the sec-
ond Thursday of the semester at 8:00 a. m.
and then only in accordance with these rules.
(October 3, 1935.)

(a) The above paragraph shall be construed
to include communication by telephone.
telegraph, or by any other direct or in-
direct means the making‘ of an appoint-
ment or engagement with a new stu-
dent by a fraternity or any of its mem-
bers or pledges prior to the opening of
rushing season whether or not a fra-
ternity is deﬁnitely stated as the motive
for the apD0iI1tment-

2. At 8:00 a. m., on the second Thursday of
the semester, the restriction against inﬂuenc-
ing new students shall be lifted and the so-
called “rushing period" shall begin. The rush-
ing period shall end at 2:00 a. In. on the
third Sunday of the semester (October 13,
1935 .

(a)) A rushee may be the guest of one or
more fraternities as opportunities are
afforded him, but under no circum-
stances shall he remain in a fraternity
house over night; nor shall he be the
guest of any fraternity member or
pledge over night.

3. Coincident with the close of the rushing
period at 2:00 a. m. on the third Sunday of
the semester (October 13, 1935). the silence
or bidding period shall begin and shall con-
tinue until the ﬁfth Monday of the semester
(October 21, 1935) at 5:00 p. m. During the

silence or bidding period, no member or mem-
bers. pledge or pledges, of a fraternity shall
approach, talk to, or communicate by direct
or indirect means with any newly registered
student.

4. All invitations to pledge to fraternities
shall be issued by the preferential‘ system
through the Oﬁice of the Dean of Men, and
no invitation shall be issued otherwise.

(a) Before 9:30 9.. m. on the fourth Monday
of the semester (October 14, 1935) the
fraternities shall submit to the office
of the Dean of Men sealed bids, on the
prescribed forms, for the students whom
they wish invited to pledgeship. As
rapidly as possible, the Oﬁice of the
Dean of Men shall issue these invita-
tions.

During the period of silence. a rushee
may make known to the Office of the
Dean of Men his choice of a fraternity.
At the conclusion of the period of Bi.
lence (October 21, 1935) the Oflice of
the Dean of Men shall transmit to the
fraternities the acceptances and declina-
tions received from their rushees.

5. Coincident with the close of the silence or
bidding period at 5:00 p. m. on the ﬁfth Mon-
day of the semester (October 21, 1935). the
fraternities shall not pledge or issue invita-
tions to pledgeship to newly-registered stu-
dents for a period of one month.

(a) Newly-registered students may be enter.
tained by fraternities during this pe-
riod, but in no case shall they be
pledged before 9:00 a. m., Thursday,
November 21,, 1935.

Fraternities Meet
In First Council

(Continued From Page One)
voted for an Interfraternity smoker for
freshmen and letters to the out-of-
town ﬁrst-year men. After a smoker
date was set, Rodgers moved for “no
smoker.” The motion was defeated.
A motion providing for the attendance
at the smoker of only the Greek rep-
resentatives to council was defeated.

Finally, it was decided to drop the
smoker.
Summary: One banquet and one

smoker, after being approved, were
dropped. Only Harvey’s letter mo-
tion was left from approximately two
hours of legislation. Then Zinsser
suggested a bonﬁre to open the drive
for an undefeated football season.
Considering it a rushing project, Har-
vey was quoted: “A bonﬁre doesn’t
make much light; and it would be just
like a nest of thieves in the dark.”
The bonﬁre program was defeated.
Hastily consulting their watches, the
boys decided that perhaps Mr. Baer
was about to enter the ring and the
meeting was adjourned.

After the meeting, Durkin appoint-
ed Morris Rosenbloom, BA36, Pi
Lambda Phi, to the chairmanship of
the temporary housing committee for
the purpose of contacting the out-of-
town freshmen by means of a letter.
_He also immediately made plans for
a special council meeting to be held
October 16. Fraternity rushing starts
Thursday, October 3, continuing up
until 2 o clock Sunday morning, Octo-
ber 13.

Freshman Clubs Start
New Year Next Week

cations, marriage, personal develop-
ment, religion, and other matters of
importance to students. Open forum
follows the speaker of the day.

Mr. Mendenhall advises all fresh-

Sixteen hundred strong, the entire

cadet corps of the United States Mili- '

tary Academy will swing into the
Stadium to execute marching maneu-
vers before the Panthers come out to
do battle with the visiting Army ag-
gregation on Saturday, November 9.

The group of cadets will be the
largest ever moved to a city west of
the Alleghenies. When the Army
corps came here in 1931 for a similar
appearance there were only 1200 of
the men clad in gray. Since then en-
rollment at the West Point school has
been increased. ,

Major R. B. Woodruff, in charge of
the movement of the cadet corps from
West Point to Pittsburgh and back,
recently disclosed plans for the Army
men’s stay here. The corps is sched-
uled to arrive in the city on Saturday
morning, and break ranks for the trip
to Oakland, where they will lunch.

At approximately 12:45 o'clock the
cadets will assemble in the Oakland
district and march to the Stadium.
There they will maneuver on the grid-
iron before breaking ranks and trott-
ing to their reserved sections in the
stands. In case of inclement weather
the marching drills will likely be our-
tailed or called off.

After the game the cadets will dine
downtown and be guests of the Uni-
versity at a military ball in the Wil-
liam Penn Hotel. Proceeds from this

When these two gentlemen are on

Third Corps area, to aid disabled and
needy veterans. A midnight train will
carry the cadets back to West Point.

from East Chicago, Indiana, appears
to have landed the varsity fullback
job. Johnny Dougert, a junior, and
Rector, a senior, form the reserve
group for this position.
Waynesburg Lineup Set

VVaynesburg will line up with Ben
Parker and Matt Wasko at ends; Bill
Lummins and Joe McCune at tackles;
Al Jones and Guy Tornabene at
guards; and Don Avery, at center.
The starting quartet in the backﬁeld
will be made of Arnold Koepke at
quarter, Jim VVorden and Bill Mc-
Glumphy at halfbacks, and Bob Criss
at fullback.

The Yellow Jackets’ main offensive
weapon will probably be a varied for-
ward and lateral passing attack
which should serve as a good opening
day test for the Panthers.

Like the Panthers, the Wolfmen
were hit hard by graduation and will
start a comparatively untried eleven.
Five sophomores will be found in the
starting lineup together with four

will show four ﬁrst-year men, a.
quartet of Juniors, and three seniors
in their starting array.

While indications seem to favor the
Panthers starting their season off on
the right foot, past opening day rec-
ords show that unexpected events can
happen. For the past two years, the
Blue and Gold eleven has met plenty
o- stiff opposition in inaugural affairs.
VV & J , whom the Panthers bump into
next Saturday, was the team responsi-
ble for giving the Pitt boys many
anxious moments both last year and
the year before.

Distributing a gray and blue folder
to all women on campus, the YWCA
starts its silver anniversary member-
ship drive Monday.

The folder will invite sophomores,

It will also serve to acquaint fresh-
men with YVVCA activities in which
they may participate.

In a welcome on the ﬁrst page, Nona
Monks, Ed36, president of the YWCA,
points out that the YVVCA “can help
a girl not only on campus but after
graduation.”

The theme of the folder, “Facing
Frontiers,” is divided into four
phases under which are 15 interests.
The phases are concerned with reli-
gious experience, personality develop-
ment, group relationships, and busi-
ness management.

The interests and the committee
chairman of each interest are: Religi-
ous Experience Conferences, Martha
Marsh, Ed36; Discussions, Frances
Unseld, Ed36; General Program, Sara
Marie Wood, C37, and Anne Thomp-
son, C38; II.-iterature, Jean Myer,
Ed36; Personality Development, Cam-
pus Life, Grace Quil, C37; Freshman,
Margaret Lehm, Ed36; Membership,
Emily Chilcote, C37; The X Club,
Jane Kahler, C37; Group Relation-
ships: Economic Relations, Alice
Crutchﬁeld, C36; Inquiry Forum,
Katherine Monori, C36; International
Relations and Politics, Annabelle

Pallaye, C37, and Alberta Rus-
sell, C36; Business Management,
Candy and Milk Counter, Ruth Raup,
Ed37; Finance, Anne Hayward, C37;
Posters, Louise Jackson, C37.

Any girl who signs the purpose
stated in the folder automatically be-
comes an active voting member of
the YWCA. Those who do not sign
the purpose but wish to do work will
be associate members.

Miss ‘Helen C, Battrlck, executive
secretary of the YVVCA, Will supervise
the membership drive, assisted by
Emily Chilcote, C37, and the member-
ship committee.

Choral To Hold
Tryouts Today

Group To Make A Final Selection
Of New Singers, Accompanist

Toda.y, from 3:45 to 5:45 o’clock, in
Room 817, Cathedral of Learning, the
VVomen’s Choral will hold the last in
a series of tryouts for membership.
Any sophomore, junior, or senior
women who a.re interested in singing
should try out at this time. There
will also be a place for an assistant
accompanist, and any upperclass girl
who would enjoy such a position with
the VVomen’s Choral should try out
today.

Only women who a.re prevented from
trying out today because of a cold or
for some other acceptable reason will
be permitted to try out at a later
date. Such women should consult the
Choral adviser, Mrs. Robert D.
Ayars, and make an appointment. The
list of girls who have been selected
as members of the VVomen’s Choral
as a result of this week’s tryouts will
be posted on Saturday, September 28,
and on Monday, September 30-, on the
bulletin boards just outside Alumni
Hall and in the Cathedral.

The Women’s Choral has made a
change in its plans for this year’s re-
hearsals. The group will rehearse in
Room 1001, Cathedral, in place of
their former Room 817. The -re-
hearsals are regularly scheduled for
each Monday during the school year,
from 3:30 to 5:30 o’clock. There will
be one Choral dinner each month.

Cwens To Discuss Plans
At Meeting Next Week

Cwens, sophomore honorary activi-
ties fraternity, will hold their ﬁrst
regular meeting next Wednesday at
3:30 o'clock, in Room 202, Alumni
Hall.

At the meeting more deﬁnite plans
will be formulated for the affairs
Cwens have planned for this year:
tea dances, a luncheon for members
of Mortar Board, a tea for members of
the faculty, a mothers’ tea.

The monthly dinner meeting of
Cwens will take place on Wednesday,
October 16.

Barton, Who Gives Out
Jobs, Foresees Upturn

 

During the summer vacation stu-
dents did everything from playing in
a sea-going jazz band to holding back
the surging crowds at Oakmont when
the National Open golf tournament
was in progress, according to J.
Clyde Barton, director of the Univer-
sity Placement Bureau.

Passing out samples of a popular
brand of cigarettes provided summer
work for 22 University men.

Prospects for the coming year
seem brighter in Mr. Barton’s opinion.
Placements are 50 per cent ahead of

last year with 101 men from last
year's class being already placed.
“it seems as though business in

general has taken a hold, and appar-
ently we are in for n1al<"-_ng more
money this year than last,” Mr. Bar-
ton declared.

Artists Wanted

Pitt Players requests those interest-
ed in art work to see Alfred Berkowitz,
BA36, in Room 709, Cathedral, be-
tween 1 and 2:30 o’clock this after-
noon.

 

Reporter Finds
Freshman Class

‘Not So Dumb’

The days when “freshman” and
“green” were synonyms are over, ac-
cording to those in the know. The
girls at the registrar’s window in
State Hall say that this year’s crop is
comparatively brilliant.

There are always the exceptions. of
course, like the boy who asked where
the Cathedral of Learning was, and
the people who go to the YWCA
candy stand to locate the Alumni Hall
clock are still too frequent. But on
the whole the teachers have hopes of
this new class’s I. Q's being fairly
high, The stories which the sopho-
mores were wont to circulate with
glee in other years have fallen off.
About the best to date is the one
about the naive coed who examined a
Demolay pin which a second—semester
freshman girl was wearing. She
wa11ted to know what it was, and
when she was told, asked when the
older girl had joined Demolay. She
thought it was a campus fraternity.

Then there was the little girl who
came up to a senior with an air of
deep secrecy.

“May I ask you a personal ques-
tion?” she asked.

“Sure,” said the senior, or words to
that eﬁect. The freshman looked at
the other’s sandal-shod feet.

“Does it hurt your feet to wear
shoes like that to school?”

But perhaps the best story yet is
the one concerning the freshman boy
who asked his upperclass counselor
if he would be excused from a 2:30
gym class to go to the Howdy Hop.

Mentor Meeting Series
Begin At Drill Hour Today

Freshman women will meet their
mentors in an oﬂicial conference for
the ﬁrst time at 1:10 o’clock today.
The mentor groups are smaller this
year, having only ﬁve girls in each
one, with forty-ﬁve groups. It is be-
lieved that the smaller group plan
will facilitate not only the discussion,
but also the college orientation
course.

During the eight-week period the
girls will discuss various phases of
University life, including the unit sys-
tem, fraternity life, and Women’s
place in activities.

The mentor groups will meet in
rooms in Alumni Hall, Thaw Hall, and
the Cathedral of Learning.

With the beginning of another
school year, fraternity groups are re-
uniting and reorganizing for work and
social affairs. The men’s fraternities
are especially busy preparing for the
fall rushing season which opens soon.
Panhellenic Council and the women’s
fraternities are planning to help the
freshman women become better ac-
quainted with the upperclassmen.

Fraternity groups have already
planned extensive social seasons and
l\lother’s Clubs have been helping re-
decorate and refurnish many of the
houses.

The Pitt News plans to print the
news of all these events every Friday.
Each fraternity should appoint one
person to be responsible for reporting
all news of that organization to the
Fraternity Editor every Tuesday aft-
ernoon at the News office, Room 709,
Cathedral, or leave a note on the
News bulletin board.

Hat Designers
For Coed Prom

With memories of the Lantern
Night ceremony still fresh in the
minds of freshman women, their at-
tention is now focused on the equally
picturesque Coed Prom, less than two
weeks off.

The Prom is the first strictly social
event for the new class, and is given
in their honor by the \Vomen’s Ath-
letic Association.

Like most other University events,
the Prom has its own traditions. Tra-
dition rules that the new women shall
be escorted by upperclass women,
garbed in male attire. The most in-
teresting custom, which has been ob-
seryed since the innovation of the
Prom way way back, is the freshman
parade of hats.

Hats, made of blue and gold crepe
paper, and modelled by their own
creators, are worn by each freshman
guest. Generally a definite theme is
announced, but much individuality is
displayed. ‘There is also a grand
march, and it is at this time that a
group of faculty members, acting as
judges, select the winning creations.

And there is another thing about
this hat parade. For some reason or
other, the prize winner for the last
three years has been a future physical
education major. That, too, may be
different this year.

WAA To Adopt
New Group Plan

Members To Organize Into Clubs
For Their Athletic Activities

 

Facilities of the ‘Women’s Athletic
Association will be available to an in-

creased number of women students

this year, it is believed, through the
adoption of a new plan for member-
ship.

A recognized handicap in WAA par-

ticipation has been the necessary
scheduling of many events at the
Trees Gymnasium, 11ot centrally lo-

cated on the campus.

This year, members will be organ-
ized into clubs, small groups that will
meet at a place of their own choosing
and go together to the gymnasium.

In addition, it is believed that some
of the VVAA activities will be sched-
uled at places more conveniently lo-
cated, A member may join two clubs,
making her selection from a list which
includes hockey, outing, tennis, volley-
ball, dancing, swimming, archery,
riding, golf, badminton, baseball, bas-
ketball, hiking, riﬂery, life-saving,
ping pong and handball.

Besides the separate clubs, monthly
Association events are planned. The
WAA board and its advisers will hold
a week-end outing on October 5 and
6. At this time additional member-
ship plans will be formulated.

 

Health Examinations

 

Dr. Auleene Marley Jamison, di-
rector of the VVomen’s Student Health
Service, has issued a last call for
physical examinations. All freshman
women, transfers, and physical edu-
cation majors who have not as yet
had their examinations are requested
to call at the office at Room 222
Alumni Hall, and make an appoint-
ment. These examinations are com-
pulsory_
