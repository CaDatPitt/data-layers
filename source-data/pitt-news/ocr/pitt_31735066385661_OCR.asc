UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Architect's fees for the expansion of the
weight room at Trees Hall have been
allocated by Student Government Board,
the first expenditure from the SGB reserve
fund under the plan set up by Allocations
Committee chairman Gil Borok last fall.

Last Wednesday, acting Vice President
for Student Affairs Dennis Donharn
approved the SGB’s proposal for $1,250,
half of what the fees will cost. The other
half will be funded by the intramural
department at Trees Hall.

“The process went very smoothly,” Borok
said. “The board submitted the proposal

to [the Allocations Committee] two weeks
ago. We followed the procedure I worked
out at the beginning of last term.”

According to Borok’s plan, the SGB and
the Allocations Committee must agree on
a “capital expenditure” from the fund.
After that, it must be approved by both the
director of student activities and the vice
president for student affairs.

"lBorok’s plan] looks like a good idea,”
said Donham. “It gives [the SGB] what the
word implies, a reserve for bi gger projects.

Borok cautioned that the only decision
made was to have the architect’s fees
come from the fund. No other decisions
on the weight room have been made.

“They may or may not [renovate the

weight room], depending on costs and
how many sponsors we get. For right
now, I think it’s a prudent move to have an
architect look at the costs. This is something
that has to be done, because we need the
estimates,” he said.

He added that this was a good project to

I be funded from the reserve fund. “llf the

room is expanded], it will be beneﬁcial for
a large number of students. It also ﬁts the
definition of ‘capital expenditure.’ It is
nice to see money from the reserve fund
go to something,” he said.

“The project is very much in the students’
interest," said Donham. “We don’t have
enough recreational space.”

According to former SGB memberjustin

Lawhead, who worked on the project last
year, “I'm excited that the project is going
through. The fact that it’s coming from the
reserve fund shows that they are using the
fund correctly. There is a direction for the
fund.”

Controversy arose last spring when it
was discovered that there was over $72,000
of student money in the reserve fund with
no plans for use. Borok worked on his
proposal during the spring, and it was
approved last fall by the administration.

In the past, reserve-fund money was
used to buy the neon sculpture in the
William Pitt Union and the African wood
bench on the corner of Bigelow Boulevard
and Fifth Avenue.

SGB sarveyfmds Department of Public Safety inadequate

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

At Thursday night’s Student
Government Board meeting,
board member Michael Cohen
released the findings of a recent
poll taken concerning public
safety.

The survey, which asked
students to answer seven
questions dealing with safety
issues, was given two weeks ago
at various sites across campus. A

total of 848 were collected.

One of the questions asked of
the students was if they had ever
heard of the 624-4HLP tip line for
public safety. Only 22.6 percent
had ever heard of such a line.
SGB Presidentjulie Shepard said,
“Despite the efforts of Katie
lMalaspinal and Jay [Gervasoni],
few students have ever heard of
this line. It is upto Public Safety
to better advertise this phone
line.”

The survey revealed that 95.5

percent of the students polled
said that they had never seen an
incident report, which public
safety director Bill Brennan said
had been placed all over campus
for people to report crimes and
other complaints. Cohen
criticized Public Safety for the
figure.

“Only four percent have ever
seen an incident report,” he said.
“That’s ridiculous. Where do you
go for a problem?” Of the 35 who
said they had seen the reports,

only three claimed that they had
ever ﬁlled one out
Students were also asked to
rate the safety of the streets on
campus. On six of the eight streets
named, less than two percent of
those polled said that they felt
that the safety on those streets
was excellent. Half of the streets
received a poor rating from over
30 percent.
Shepard said, ‘The average
rating for the safety of the streets
was only fair [one grade above

the lowest level]. The students
don’t feel safe. It's up to public
Safety to make the students feel
safer.”

Along with street safety, the
question of a South Oakland
shuttle also appearedon the poll.
86.5 percent of the students
surveyed said that there was a
need for the service.

“Brennan said that he wanted
some sort of proof of how the
students felt," Cohen said. “Well,

foes demontrte outside downtown clinic

By Erik Kr-idle
Staff Writer

The National Abortion Rights
Action League escorts in the
yellow shirts were waiting on the
street corners, looking for clinic-
bound women. The leaders for
Operation Rescue, red bands
wrapped about their arms, were
leading their groups in song and
prayer for, they said, clinic—bound
women.

The street outside Women’s
Health Services downtown on
Saturday was the podium. Both
sides were out in force to speak
their respective minds as 1,200
protestors showed up.

“We’re keeping the clinic open,”
saidjeanne Clarke, a pro-abortion
spokeswoman from Squirrel Hill.
“The anti-abortion forces
announced that they were going
to come en masse and close the
clinic. So we decided they weren’t
going to do it this time."

Clarke and a group of pro-
choicers stood and chanted in
front of the clinic doors.
Occasionally they made way for
a woman accompanied by yellow-
shirted escorts. They intended to
remain outside the clinic, Clarke
said, for “as long as it takes” to
make sure all patients and staff
could get in and out.

“Today is the first day of our
Stand Up for Women project,”
Clarke said. “We’re going to be
using a massive phone bank to

alert our people in the future.

“Every time the anti-abortion
people are here, we’ll be here.
We won't let them close a clinic
anymore.”

While the pro—life faction
chanted, others prayed.

“Heavenly Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do,”
cried one pro-life advocate,
leading a group in prayer. No
sooner had he finished his prayer
than another in the group spoke
up and continued. One after
another, this went on until there
was silence. Pause. Singing.

“It’s church on the streets,” said
Dougjames, area coordinator for
Operation Rescue. “We’re here
to pray, worship the Lord, repent
and stand together in unity to
pray for the end of this child
killing.

“The pro-abortion, the NOW
people  they organized this in
response to what we are doing.

“We’re not here to concern
them. We told our people last
night to get their eyes off the
people and keep them on Jesus."

Beverly Stone, spokeswoman
for the Religious Coalition for
Abortion Rights, said she was
there to prove a point.

"I'm here in support of the
Women’s Health Services clinic
and as a witness to the fact that
there are religious people who
believe that choice is
appropriate,” she said.

Summerlea Kashar/For The Pitt News

Pro-choicers gathered outsideWomens' Health Services to keep anti-abortionists from attempting

to close the clinic.

‘'1 think there’s a difference
between their religious
understanding [and] our religious
understanding and what the state
can or cannot do, It's a religious-
liberties issue.” -

The police also attended the

demonstration. Yesterday, unlike
many times in the past, no arrests
were made. Still, the police were
ready, and paddywagons filled
the street.

This is the ‘nevi?’ Operation
Rescue, James said

‘As you may be familiar,
Operation Rescue in the past has
physically intervened, and there
[have] been arrests and people
dragged away. We’re not sticking
to that principle, but this is an
outreach of it,’ he said.

, Mandela 's release celebrated 

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, February 19, 1990

By Aric Buckholt
For The Pitt News

The release of South African
opposition leader Nelson
Mandela was celebrated with
words and wishes by
approximately 300 people in the
William Pitt Union Assembly
Room Saturday night.

The event, sponsored in part
by Pitt's Black Action Society and
the department of blackeducation
community research and
development, featured speeches
by various educators and
community- group leaders. A
message was signed by everyone
present which will be sent to
Mandela in Soweto, South Africa.

“It was not a white hand that
turned the key to release Mandela;
it was the hand of black Africans
and people around the world
who turned the key,” said the
master of ceremonies, poet-
activist Moe Seager. In his opening
statement, Seager also accused
the Western media, in particular
CBS’s Dan Rather and ABC’s Ted

g Koppel, of “whitewashing” the

situation.

According to Seager and most
of the other speakers, Mandela’s
release from prison does not mean
that apartheid is gone. “He is

alive and free by being out of 9

prison, but do not be fooled; the
Africans and apartheid have not
yet come to terms,” said Seager.

Seager also pointed out
situations in the West which are
very similar. According to Seager,
“If you don’t think we have

apartheid here [in America], you

haven’t opened your eyes.” A
standing ovation by the audience
followed.

Justin Laing, BAS chairman of
public relations, noted that work
still has to be done. According to
Laing, “We may see that the rest
of the struggle is a downhill battle,
and that is the danger.” He also
pointed out that the South African
situation is not an issue of
Mandela, but “an issue of 27
million vs. 5 million.” Laing urged
the audience “to make [Mandela]
the rock that kicks off the
avalanche.”

Many of the speakers pointed
out the success of many different
groups in supporting sanctions
against the South African
government and their success in
getting stores and groups to divest
holdings in South Africa. They
urged that these sanctions must
continue until the “evil of
apartheid" is gone in South Africa.

Professor Ladun Anise said that
“people around the world must

ask many questions about South
Africa.” He pointed out “that Nazi
Germany is rising again in South
Africa.”

“How soon did we forget what
happened in Europe from 1939
to 1945?” he asked. Anise also
expressed his feeling that the
event was also a chance to
“celebrate the chance for freedom
of blacks to continue.”

Keynote speaker Dennis
Brutus, who is himself in exile,
said that people watching the
events in South Africa must ask
two questions: “‘What exactly
does it mean?’ and ‘Where do we
go from here?”’

He reiterated the feeling that
Mandela is not really free, but
that he was just released from a
narrow prison cell into the “larger

g prison of South Africa.”

“Until the system [of apartheid]
is destroyed, no one can really be
free,” said Brutus.

character — that newspaper will generally find itself in
court as the defendant in a libel case.

And if those printed statements are found to be entirely
false and without cause, the newspaper will end up '
paying a large sum of money to the plaintiff.

l So it’s no surprise that two B-94 disc jockeys were found
guilty of harassing a female co-worker over the air,
resulting in nearly $700,000 in damages.

The insensitive remarks directed at B-94’s former new
director, Liz Randolph, were of a sexual nature. “Banana”
Don Jefferson and Jim Quinn reported on more than one
occasion in their morning wake-up show that Randolph
was involved in an orgy, that she had sex with the Steelers
and that she had sexually transmitted diseases, among '
other things. i . ‘

Some employees might have found the remarks amus-
ing and cast them off as harmless antics of the comedy
team. Randolph, however, was well within her rights to
defend herself against the accusations.

Randolph did not have to allow herself to be the brunt _
of these jokes. Yet when she attempted to end them by
talking to the Djs and her boss, she was belittled again.
Her boss said that she should be able to take the jokes,

' and if she complained about them and attempted to land

another job, he’d fire her first. The Djs essentially called
her a baby. \

Under no circumstances should Randolph have had to
put up with any of the harassments. Apparently, the D] s
believed she had no alternatives. Now that they are doling
out _ a large settlement, they must see that they were .
mistaken. _

While it is a pity that Randolph had to be subjected to
this abuse, it speaks even less about the media. Censor-
ship does not begin until a certain rule, unwritten or
factual, is broken. When that happens, authorities, in this
case the Federal Communications Commission, may have
no choice but to redefine their rules of on—air conduct and
further limit the capabilities of the media. For once the
authorities would be well within their rights, and the
members of the media who have consciences could not

argue.

Conﬂicts between the media and the government
should not be reduced to a spitting contest, determining
the full effect of free speech. Save that for the Weekly
World News. Responsible broadcast and print journalists
would never resort to this type of behavior, but they can
nonetheless be punished for it.

Apartheid likened to fascism  

’’When I hear people call South
Africa a capitalist country, I don ’t
know whetherto laugh orczy. ”-——
South African Zulu Chief M.G.
Buthelezi, commenting on the
misconception that many people
hold about South Africa.

Many people think that apart-
heid is caused by capitalism.

However, this is not true. Apart— I

heid and capitalism, have abso-
lutely nothing 1 in ' common. The
capitalists in South Africa have

always been ﬁghting against

apartheid. ,

What apartheid really is, is
fascism. Apartheid is a govem-
ment-instituted policy of racism.
The South African government
has passed many laws that man-
date discrimination. The Popula-
tion Registration Act classiﬁes
every South African according to
race, and that affects how the
government treats the citizens.
The Group Areas Act says which
racial groups can live where. The
government allows whites to live
in the good areas and forces
blacks to live in slums. The gov-
ernment decides who can hold
what kinds of jobs. This is fas-
cism, very much like World Wa
II Nazi Germany. ‘

Capitalism, on the other hand,

is nothing like this at all. In a‘

capitalist society, none of the
above regulations would exist.

Capitalism is a system based
upon individuals interacting with
each other on voluntary terms.
Whether it be the buying and
selling of property, employment
or other things, the actions are
determined by those involved,
without any government inter-
ference.

For years, capitalists in South
Africa have been ﬁghting against
the racial policies of the South
African government.

In the first decade of this cen-
tury, the South African govern-
ment passed laws that required
the mining industry to _discn'mi-
nate against blacks. The mine
owners did not like this. The

mine owners were greedy capi-
talists and wanted to make as
much money as possible. To do
this, they wanted to hire the
workers with the best skills. In
this case, many of the highly
skilled workers were black. In

A order to make money, the greedy

capitalists hired_the black work-
ers.

The government objected. The
government ofﬁcials were bigots
who passed laws that required
the mine owners to discriminate
against blacks. The laws hurt the
blacks, and they also hurt the
greedy capitalists who wanted to
make money. Of course, such
laws did not hurt the govern-
ment ofﬁcials.

Over the years, the South Afri-
can government has passed laws
that require discrimination in
many other professions. Some-
times, the government fines
businesses for hiring “too many"
blacks or for promoting them to
higher positions than the gov-
ernment would allow. However,
the greedy capitalists continue to
break the govemment’s rules. As
long as the blacks have skills, the
greedy capitalists will employ
them.

Besides employment, capital-
ism is anti-racist in other areas.
For example, if someone owns a
food store, he will want to sell as
much food as he can so he can
make as much money as pos-
sble. If he turns away customers,

he will lose money. I l I
The Coca-Cola Company ha

been criticized many times for‘

investing in South Africa. Critics
charge that the company has been
supporting apartheid. I seriously
doubt that this is true. Just be-

' cause a corporation is geographi- _

callylocated in South Africa does
not mean that it supports apart-
heid. . T

.;..-.Ihe,»South.Africangovernment

 
 

but Coca-Cola refused to listen

and hired them anyway. Thus, I

Coca-Cola was fighting against
apartheid.

Many Americans don't under-
stand this and have been criticiz-
ing any and all companies that do
business in South Africa. After
much public pressure from
Americans, Coca-Cola pulled out
of South Africa in 1986. I wonder
how many black South Africans
lost their jobs as a result.

Some people, such as mem-
bers V of the African National
Congress, have been advocating
communism as a means of end-
ing apartheid. In reality, that is a
terrible idea. If South Africa be-
came communist, the government
would have even more power,
and the oppression of blacks
would be even worse.

As an example, consider Ethio-
pia, a communist country. The
Ethiopian government forces

. many of the blacks to live in the

desert. As a result, they are starv-
ing. For those of you who have
seen Sally Struthers on television
begging for money, you should
know what I am talking‘ about.

South Africa needs capitalism.
Capitalism is the only economic
system in which individuals are
free to interact with each other
however they so wish. Under
capitalism, economic activity is
determined by the people in-
volved in it, not by the govern-
ment. The people of South Africa
need such freedom.

Villanova corrects early
mistakes as they shut
down Pitt's inside game

By Jim Tezak
Contributing Editor

VILLANOVA, PA — The Pitt Panthers didn't learn their lesson, and
the Villanova Wildcats did.

That was the difference in the ‘Wildcats 71-68 victory over Pitt at
DuPont Pavilion on Saturday before a sellout crowd of 6,500.
Villanova upped its record to 15-12, 7-7 in the Big East and kept alive
its hopes for an NCAA tournament bid. Pitt dropped to 10-13, 4-8 in
the conference.

When the teams met at Fitzgerald Field House earlier this year,
Villanova’s sharpshooters, led by Chris Walker, riddled the Panther
defense for a Big East record: 15 three—point ﬁeld goals.

OnSaturday, the Wildcats again exploited Pitt’s zone defense,
shooting seven for 12 from three—point range. The first three shots of
the game were three-pointers, two by Walker, who led the Wildcats
with 15 points, as Villanova ran out to a 13-0 lead.

“They came out in a zone [defense]. If they’re going to play a 2-3
zone and we’re patient, we’re going to get the ball inside and kick it

v back out and have a wide-open shot,” said Villanova guard Greg

Woodard, who had three treys in the first half.

The Wildcats also did what they didn’t do in the first game: stop
Brian Shorter. Shorter, who scored 24 points and grabbed eight
rebounds in the first meeting, was held to 10 points and five boards.
Villanova center Torn Greis was the player given the task of defending
Shorter, the Big East’s leading scorer at 21.8 points per game.

“Probably the key to the game was Tommy Greis playing Brian
Shorter,” said Villanova Coach Rollie Massirnino. “It was a challenge
that we gave him, and he responded to that challenge.”

“When you have a guy that plays as well as Brian Shorter, you just
kind of play it by ear. Our strategy was to keep me between him and
the basket. I was just trying to keep him as far away from the "basket
as possible,” Greis said.

Although Greis was the player assigned to guard Shorter, itwas
Villanova’s team defense that actually contained him.

“We decided to attack him a little bit more,” Woodard said. “We
tried to double team him down low. We deﬁnitely stopped them from
lobbing the ball into him. That’s how he gets the ball most of the time.”

Shorter, who managed only seven ﬁeld-goal attempts, said, “My
shot just .wasn’t falling. [Greis] did a pretty good job of fronting me,
and they got a lot of weak-side help.”

Shorter played just 27 minutes due to foul trouble. He picked up
his third foul with 11:26 remaining in the first half and finished the

game with ﬁve.

Lacrosse clubsearching for Varsity status in Big East

Staff Writer

transfers to last year’s team which
had about 30 players. There were
no players lost to graduation.

The Pitt lacrosse club will open
its second season in search of
university and student support.

The team went 10-4 last year
while competing in the Allegheny
Valley Lacrosse League, which
includes local teams such as West
Virginia, Carnegie Mellon and
Slippery Rock. Pitt’s coach, Gary
Neft, who also coaches the Mt.
Lebanon High School team, says
the team will rely on the growing
popularity of the sport for student
(fan) support. He said the addition
of a Pittsburgh franchise in the
Major Indoor Lacrosse League is
evidence of the growing
popularity of lacrosse.

There will be more than 50
players on this year’s team. It is
the second most popular sport at
Pitt next to football in terms of
number of participants. The team
will add 18 freshmen and several

The lacrosse team currently has
only club status at Pitt and is
seeking varsity status from the
university athletic department.
Varsity status would allow the
lacrosse team to receive financial
support from the university.

However, Neft said the
university has not been
cooperative even in allowing
practice time for the team at Pitt
Stadium.

“The university is being, pretty
much, jerks about the whole
thing," said Neft. He said the
athletic department lost papers
submitted by the team to ask
permission for use of Pitt stadium
for practices and games. Neft had
to resubmit forms and wait for
their approval, which delayed
the start of preseason practice.

“If they take any longer, I’m

going to jump through their

Foul trouble kept Brian Shorter from being a dominant factor in the Panthers’ game plan.

throats,” said Neft after he had to
resubmit the forms. “If the
university is going to be jerks, I
can be just as big a jerk.”

Neft has met with Dean Billick,
associate director of athletics,
about the possibility of the
lacrosse team being granted
varsity status. Billick said there
are currently four programs which
have expressed the desire to
become intercollegiate sports.
Billick would not say what other
programs have sought varsity
status.

“At present, we are not in a
position to expand,” said Billick.
“I told that to the lacrosse coach.”
He said although the possibility
of adding more sports is
periodically reviewed, financial
concerns are the main reason
why there are presently no plans
to do so.

There are 18 varsity sports at
Pitt. But Billick said Pitt has not
added a varsity sport in about 24

years.

“What I’m up against is that
they haven't added a new [varsity]
team in 25 years,” said Neft. “The
other thing is funding."

“Periodically, we get [a certain]
number of teams that would like
to become varsity sports,” Billick
said, “but we are not in a position
to expand financially. If we did,
we would increase support for
the present teams."

Billick said Pitt's varsity sports
teams are currently “under-
scholarshipped."

“We give less than 60 percent
of the amount of scholarships
that the NCAA [National Collegiate
Athletic Association] permits.”

The NCAA is the national
governing body for intercollegiate
sports.

The only two sports at Pitt that
receive the maximum number of
scholarships permitted by the
NCAA are football and basketball.

But Neft said it would not cost

the university much money to
add lacrosse.

“When I submitted a budget, it
was one—third less than the least
expensive varsity sport.”

Neft said the lacrosse team’s
budget added up to only about
$5,000 because he would not ask
for any scholarships. He said

tennis is the least expensive sport, _

costing $15,000.

Another hope for the lacrosse
team is the possibility of the Big
East conference adding lacrosse
as a league sport. Neft said there
are issues which would have to
be worked out, but he believes it
will happen possibly as early as
next year.

The Big East, which formed in
1979, welcomes the addition of
more sports to its conference.
This past year it added women’s
softball and field hockey.

“Every year we review the

sports that are conducted at

.. Lacrosse-

member schools,” said Big East
assistant commissioner Tom
McElroy.

“We have had some interest
from member schools that want
to build their [lacrosse] program‘
in forming a Big East conference.
Lacrosse is becoming a very
popular sport in major Big East
markets [New York City, New
Jersey, Philadelphia, Washington,
D. C.]."

McElroy said the first criteria
for adding a sport in the
conference is that six of the
member schools must have a
team. There are currently six Big
East schools which ﬁeld a varsity
lacrosse team. Varsity status for

Pitt’s team would make the total

seven.

McElroy said that every school
in the conference does not have
to participate in all conference
sports. He said the only sports
each member school is required
to participate in are basketball,
men’s and women’s track, cross
country and swimming.

“The next question is
commonality of program,” said
McElroy. “Is it good for Pitt to
play against the national
champions?”

Syracuse, which is a Big East

school, is a national power in I

lacrosse. They lost the Division-
1 national championship game
last year to Johns Hopkins
University of Baltimore, Md.

“Syracuse is an obstacle,” said
Neft. “They are in a class by
themselves. Itwouldn’tbe helpful
to them until other teams got
close to catching up [to their skill
level].”

At present, the Pitt lacrosse
team is trying to gain Division-3
status. a

McElroy added that it may be a
disadvantage for a team like
Syracuse to play a conference
schedule since the NCAA does

not award automaticbids to its _

national championship
tournament for conference

:. champions.

“That’s something Syracuse
would decide,” said McElroy.

But McElroy points out that
when the Big East added soccer,
Connecticut was the defending
national champion. “But the other
teams have come up [in skill
level].” I

McElroy did say that a number

of conference schools have made

commitments to success in
lacrosse. He said St. John’s and
Villanova have been successful
at their levels, and Georgetown
just hired last year’s coach at
Hobart, the Division—3 national
champions. .

He said the possibility of a Big
East lacrosse league will be
discussed at the next meeting in
May.

“You could say we are in a
research-and-developme nt phase
[for a lacrosse leaguel," he said.

But for now, the Pitt lacrosse
team is preparing for this season,
which starts Feb. 27 against
Slippery Rock at Pitt Stadium.

“The best thing we can do is
prove ourselves on the field,”
said Neft.

Lady Pomtbers ozcloieve big conference   win

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
team stole one from the
Syracuse Orangewomen on
Saturday, 79-67 at Fitzgerald
Field House.

It was a crucial conference
victory for Pitt (5-8) which has
three games remaining and is
trying to catch Syracuse (7-7)
for fifth V place. The
Orangewomen won the ﬁrst
meeting earlier this year, 82-
S4.

The Lady Panthers were led
by Connie Hurt with 22 points
and Turia Ransom with 15
points and 11 rebounds. Angie
Alston had 22 points and 17
rebounds for Syracuse.

“We felt like we hadto prove
something,” said Ransom.
“They blew us out up there.

‘We have a chance to get [in]
fourth or fifth place.”

“Today we knew that we had
to beat Syracuse like nothing
else mattered. T here’s no
tomorrow,” said Pitt co—captain
Lorri Johnson.

In the last meeting, Syracuse
was able to run on the Lady
Panthers. On Saturday, Pitt used

a 1-2-1-1 press defense to slow,

down the Orangewomen. The
Pitt defense caused 35 Syracuse
turnovers. J

“We just came out there and
followed the game plan and put
it to them,” said Johnson. “Last
time they made the fast break
work for them a lot. This time
we stopped it. We had to get
back on defense, and that’s what
we did.”

“[We had to] slow them down

and make them think about the _
shots they had to take. And then

we had to crash the boards,” said .

Pitt Coach Kirk Bruce.

When it came to inside play,
Pitt held its own against a bigger
Syracuse team. Pitt front liners
scored 62 of the team’s 79 points.

Pitt had a 34-27 halftime lead.
Freshman forward Ransom
dominated the offensive boards
in the second half. She scored all
of her points in the second half
and had eight offensive
rebounds.

Ransom ﬁred up the Pitt bench
with strong scores inside,
including a pair of three—point
plays.

“T uria [Ransom] played
inspired basketball," said Bruce.

The Lady Panthers have three
games remaining before the Big
East tournament in Connecticut
March 1 to 4. The Panthers feel

they can and must finish strong ‘

to make amends for earlier

season losses they feel they
should have won.

“We're not really satisfied with
the record we have [13-11
overalll,” said Ransom. “We
shouldn’t have lost a lot of [our]
games. We had the loss against
Boston College [77-58 last
Wednesday]  and we shouldn’t
have lost it.”

Pitt plays on Wednesday at St.
John’s (4-8), which is in seventh
place. Pitt beat them onJan. 20,
92-76.

Pitt men gymnasts dominate weekend opponents

By Sharon Kerestes
Staff Writer

Pitt gymnasts took first place in
all six events and scored 255.45
to defeatjames Madison (226.95)
and Radford University (225.95)
Saturday, improving their record
to 4-2.

Kyle MacBeth led off for Pitt
with an 8.85 to win the floor
exercise, and Brock Freehling
followed with a win on pommel
horse (8.75). Stuart Yoss and Dave
Bausrnith each scored 8.75 to
lead Pitt’s-domination on rings;
Bausmith also won the parallel

bars (9.05). Chris O’Loughlin took
the vault (8.85), and Pat Pollaci
won high bar (9.0). Pollaci also
finished first in the all-around
(31.90).

“I was very pleased. This was a
better meet for us,” said Panther
Coach Frank D’Amico, comparing
it to last weekend’s loss to Temple.

D’Amico said that in some
events, especially ﬂoor exercise,
his team scored lower than usual,
but on others it made strong
improvements.

_High bar has worried D’Amico
throughout the season, but on

Saturday the team was strong
enough in the event that he was
able to put two extra gymnasts in
the lineup. Pitt finished with the
top six scores on high bar and
scored two points higher than
last week.

“It was a pleasure to put a few
extra people on high bar and
have them do good routines,”
D’Amico said. “This is so much
better than the last three or four
years.”

In past years, D’Amico said he
had to be careful not to push his
team too hard in practice; if there
was an injury he wouldn’t have

But he hopes that he’ll be able to
continue to add people to the
lineup this year.

“This is really promising,” he
said, looking ahead to future
meets. “I don’tthinkwe’ve peaked

D’Amico attributes much of his
team’s success to its attitude and
sense of unity.

“In practice, there’s a‘ good, a

wholesome, spirited attitude, so
as a team we’ve improved,” he
said. “It’s been a very good team
effort.”

us, but we’re not getting gifts at

toughest competitors of the
season, this Saturday at Trees

Pitt, 27025-25820.

OUR SIDE

The employees of Charles J. Greve and Company
respond to the article in The Pitt News on February 13, 1990:

The Pitt News tried to arrange three meetings between the tenants and Mr. David Greve, but although Mr. Greve

was available and committed to meet with the tenants on those occasions, a time suitable for the tenants could not be

arranged. Charles J. Greve and Company Real Estate is always willing to meet with tenants if problems arise.

#1. The tenants Mast and Brant were renewal tenants. If it was so horrible an apartment, why did the tenants renew
their lease with Charles J. Greve and Company? (it should be noted that a favorable letter from one of these tenants
is on file at Greve’s office.)

“#2. Citing a specific incident where upon the bannister (which was maliciously destroyed), was brought to the Greve

office, David Greve promised replacement of post and repair of staircase and Greve came through within 24 hours
with total repair including repainting. Allegheny County Health Department confirms this.

#3. All Housing Department violations were abated within24 hours of notification to Charles J. Greve and
Company.

#4. All common areas of Greve property including area in the photograph on the front page of The Pitt News are
cleaned weekly. We invite you to follow up and check.

#5. Mr. Yingling has sublet his apartment and no longer resides in Pittsburgh and the current subtenant has no
complaints regarding the apartment and has asked to renew for next year.

#6. Charles J. Greve and Company employs Cathedral Answering Service to handle 24-hour-a-day calls, seven days
a week including. holidays.

- Charles J. Greve and Company is committed to quality housing and management.
- We invite you to inspect any or all apartments that we manage/own.

- We are always willing to negotiate and write into our leases speciﬁc alterations to accomodate
tenants. This has been and always will be our policy.
