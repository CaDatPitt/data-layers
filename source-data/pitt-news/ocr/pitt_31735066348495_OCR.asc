Students Move on Tuition Hike

BY GEORGENE KALEINA
A possible tuition increase ,was
the major concern of the ﬁrst

‘’ Once‘ again the Chancellor has‘
5*" made available to the students and

faculty of the College of Arts and
Sciences twelve
Teaching Fellowships for the Fall
Term, 1975-76. These awardsvare
worth $500 each. In addition, the
Department in which the particular
_course _ is taught may choose to
award academic credits to the
teaching fellow, presumably
through Independent Study.
Applications for these awards
should be sent to CAS Dean Robert

Undergraduate ‘

"Graduate-Professional . Student

Association‘ (GPSA), and the
General Studies Student Cabinet
suggested a coordinated program
between’ the University and stu-
dents to influence the state
legislature vote on Pitt’s ﬁscal
allocation. . '

Ted Brodie, one of the‘-students
present, said a substantial increase
in tuition would decrease the
number of low-income students
attending ‘Pitt.

“What statistics seem to indicate

is a general trend away from V

students (at Pitt) whosefamilies
are poorer,” Brodie said, “and if
tuition goes up we face a market
problem there.”

Vice-Chancellor of Finance and
Budget Jack Freeman said the key
to the problem of tuition increases
was the State allocation, on which
no recommendation has yet come
from Governor -Milton Shapp’s
ofﬁce.

“Most of us are schooled in the

philosophy of zero tuition,” ,Free- .
man said, “But that’s not what's in p
B the cards. Costsiare going up and

what we can expect from the state
will not be what we need.”

_Nick‘ Axten of the GPSA said
student groups had contacted the
administration because of a sub-

of a tuition increase, with hopes of
taking affirmative action in the
matter. -

  Tuition Increase: Inevitable

BY BILL MOORE

No deﬁnite decision on possible
tuition increases will be made until
the Governor releases his budget
for the ’75-'76 fiscal year, and even
then it is expected to take some
time.

But some increase is likely.

As it stands now, vice chancellor
of Planning and Budget Jack
Freeman is drawing up ‘scenarios’

of possible actions to be taken once

the Governor’s
through.

If Pitt is appropriated the roughly
$62 million asked for, the univer-

Budget comes

sity will be in good shape. But the
people in Harrisburg aren’t plan-
ning to give that much.

Aspokesman for the Governor’s
Budget Office, Ray Staffeldt, told
the Pitt News yesterday the univer-
sity can’t expect what they asked.
According to Staffeldt, an appro-
priations increase has been re-
commended for Pitt, but it is not
what was requested. -

“All I can say,” he said, “is that

it is the'best we could do consider-

_ ing the very, very tight revenue

situation.” Staffeldt is saying,

although the cost of living is

shooting up there will be no state.
income tax increase this year-—and
the ‘money to balance things out
will have to come°from elsewhere.

In anutshell, the Governor is not
working with enough money to give
everyone what they want. The
question now is, how much or how
/little can he give.

' This is where Freeman’s scen-

arios enter the picture.

Once the University learns how
much they will have to work with
next year, they will have to decide

ance, and Thomas Albert, Director
of University Housing Food,-;\§.ei.',-.,

Moye said, “My position ‘on
remuneration is in limbo; it isnot

the _present Board before I act.”. 

Dutton was unavailable: for -
comment and Albert declined

for services, .“mainly because the

As a result of vandalism which occured in their lavatory
last November, the 30 resident students of Tower C’s
fourth floor were each billed $8.95 by the University
Housing Office during the fall term.

Because -the identity of the vandals could not be
ascertained, each resident was billed on a pro-rated, or
divided basis with total damage costs to the lavatory
coming to $247.60.

The damage, it was determined by residents, occured

The residents have since protested the pro-rated billing,
complaining to both the Housing Office and the Legal
Awareness Committee that it was unfair, ‘and to date, only
one person has paid’ the charge. I " " .

Furthermore, it said, the students themselves were
responsible for keeping. potential troublemakers off -their
ﬂoor. ’

The residents unanimously disapprove of the reasoning
behind the billing procedure. “I’m against paying it (the
bill),” said one. “How can I be responsible for protecting
the ﬂoor’s bathroom at 3 am? That’s the job of the security
men in the Towers lobby.” '

“How can we guard against someone causing damage
once they get past the security men downstairs?” added
another. “The girls’ ﬂoors have locked glass doors for
extra protection, but we’re wide ‘open for something like
this.” \ -

identity of vandals cannot be determined. They are bound
by contract to pay for the damages.

      

Pitt’s Legal Awareness Committee agreed that the‘
residents are “stuck” with the costs. The only way’ , ,
students can "avoid paying them, it said, is if they take it to,  '7
court and prove the contract’s provision unconstitutional.

The time and money invested in such an operation, though, _
would supercede the total damage costs.

If the students refuse to pay their individual bills’, the 
charge will be put on their invoices next term. In addition‘,
they may not be allowed to reserve‘ rooms for next year if

the bills are not paid. I

Axten also called for “openness of
budget policy” in relation to "the
release of information concerning
revenues and expenditures at the
University. ‘

SG President Larry Platt com-
mented the meeting was aimed at a
coordination effort, and also to
demonstrate that students should
not bear the full weight of financial
burdens.

Freeman suggested a meeting
with _Russ Arnold, University

Director of Governmental Rela-A

tions, and inquiries to ' the
Commonwealth’s Community
Relations Committee as means of
implementing student concern on

the question of the State allocation _

and tuition increases.

The next step is a meeting
Thursday, scheduled for 8:00 pm in

student groups on campus, aimed
at organizing a coalition to prepare
aresponse to further developments
in the tuition question, according to
SG’s ‘Platt. - *

“It’s to let the students know.

hope to develop a network so when
we decide on a concrete action
proposal we can act on it.”

Police Show
Improvement

Campus Police statistics for the
last six months showed a 211%
increase in the number of solved
cases over the previous six months
period, according to Chief Curt
Graham. Part of the conscious
effort at improvement of the force
included increased officer training
and a revamping of the supervisory
structure. _

“We’re real proud,” Graham

' said. He stressed the improvement

‘.‘Is not afluke” and attributed it tb"‘»
“more professional performance
on the part of the officers in the

Last week’s police activity includ-
edthe arrest of a juvenile carrying
a knife in the Towers Lobby, and

Charges the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) was involved in dirty
tricks against US citizens and
foreign countries continue to grow,
and apparently so will the
/ ,_ investigations attempting to dig up
" ‘fiimtrhe facts. I

A special. 11-member Senate
committee formed last month to
probe the agency has decided to go
right to the top and meet with
President Ford, while the House
voted to establish its own 10-
member committee to review

American intelligence practices.
The charges stem from a
December 22, 1974, investigative
report in the New York Times
which claimed the CIA “in direct
violation of its charter, had
mounted massive, illegal intelli-
gence operations during the Nixon
administration against membersof
 the antiwar movement and other

 ”i‘~‘*tlissident groups inside the. US.”

Since then, the CIA has been cited
for spying on‘ foreign transportation
systems, arranging the sinking of
foreign ships,‘and intercepting the

mail of prominent US citizens _

including AFL-CIO President
George Meany.
Another major allegation claims
the CIA was involved in the 1973
, Allende overthrow in Chile.

Senator Richard S. Schweiker
(R-Pa), a member of the special
senate committee, said in a‘ recent

Washington press conference the.

investigation and expose were
triggered by the Watergate scan-

; dals.
" ""‘ “What we're investigating here,

goes back before Watergate, he
said, “but it’s deﬁnitely been a

catalyst. We wouldn’t. have been '

able to do this two years ago.”

- Criticism of the investigations has

surfaced in the belief that “what

the CIA did, they did in the cause

of national security.”

Canadian subway systems you begin to lose the idea of espionage as an

area of information.”

may have to be investigated on a«
“case by case basis, but we
shouldn’t have been involved in
Chile and when you getdown to
spying on Canadian subway sy-
-stemsyou begin to lose the idea of
espionage as an area of informa-
tion.” A

He said many of the CIA
“mistakes” may be tied to agents
who were told to “lie to anyone but
their boss,” and although some
covert operations are necessary in
intelligence proceedings, “‘We’ve
got to let the public know what (the
CIA) is doing as far as the law is
concerned. . . “ 4

“You only have illegal surveil-
lance when you’re contrary to the

-law,’7- he said.

Although the committee has a
September 1, 1975‘, deadline to

complete their hearings, Schweiker _

said it may be difficult tomeet that
deadline.

“I’d be surprisediif we get all we
want to get done in nine months,
dealing with the rhetoric of the
agency,”_he said. “They gave ‘us.

the nine. months because they *

didn’t want to drag it all out, but it
could take longer.” f , A
He said the number of agents and
people involved who volunteer
information would ‘have a large
effect on how fruitful the investiga-

, tions become.

come forth, and‘ that depends ong
how well we protect,them,”. he

Three areas. being considered’

presently are tuition increases,_ a

As far as tuition increases are
concerned, Freeman admits such
action is being considered. This
has been expected.
How much will tuition be increas-

Freeman said yesterday. However,
Freeman and others have said the
probable increase won’t exceed
$100 per term. ' _

What will probably occur, accord-

juggling of the three areas being

hike tuition too high, or cut back
too many programs, or limit salary

 The CAS Catch-all

‘ The largest school of this university, the College of Arts and Sciences,
: -has unfortunately been transformed into a catch-all for
non-professionals. Those students who don’t plan to be engineers,
nurses or phamiacists but want a college education have no place else
to go.‘ They go through -CAS, graduate, and ﬁnd themselves
ﬂoundering in a job market which places only marginal value on

5 Frustration, in terms of wasted time and money, is the result of the
confusion concerning the aims of students and faculty in CAS. Ifwe, as
’ students, are going to put four years and $4000 into an education at
’ Pitt, something positive had better emerge.
A A The solution to this impasse is some sort of restructuring around or
within CAS. As CAS Dean Robert Marshall has suggested, that
. change could be as mild as a gradual adaptation of the Liberal Arts
_ ideal to the pragmaticedemands of students. It could also be as
far-reaching as the metamorphisis of Pitt into an undergraduate
. professional school with a strong complement of liberal arts courses,
perhaps modeled on the School of Education.

' . "Students at Pitt should have options such as those suggested by

 Change In Our Time

Reshuffling the structure of the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) is
certainly drastic. No doubt, faculty would be affected in all areas. But,
a liberal-minded faculty is one of the basic prerequisites of the Liberal

Letter to the Editor

Chilclbeciting: What to Do?

Dear Editor,

The other day I was riding the bus
up from Downtown. I was in a sad
frame of mind, and the experience I
had on that bus ride only served to
make me sadder. It was like this:

There was this woman and her
child [or at least, I assume that the
child was hersl- The W°m3n W35

 young, and they were both seated

near the front of the bus. I was
seated at mid-bus.

The child had its hand in her
pocket. (Possibly, the child had
been reaching in this manner all
day, I don’t know.) Anyway, she
told it to get its hand out of the
pocket. Apparently, the child did
not obey the command, for the
woman found it necessary to hit the
child. The child cried. The woman
told the child to stop crying. The
child kept crying.

She then told it to stop crying once
more. The child persisted, and thus
received another smack for its
persistence. Possibly ‘she was

View from the left

annoyed by the noise, or another
possibility was that she didn’t like
the attraction the child provided for
the other bus riders. The volley
proceded in this manner, until the
woman escalated her'_ attack by
adding a small, plastic white strap
to her offense. At which time the
child retaliated with a coughing fit.

The tension was felt throughout

the bus [or at least by me], and I '

felt the helplessness I always feel
in that type of situation.

Then, an elderly woman interject-
ed a comment, along with an
action. She offered her TV Guide to
the child as a paciﬁer. The young

woman told her that the child-

didn’t wish to lookat the TV Guide.
The elderly woman counterat-
tacked with, “Maybe the child isn't
feeling well.” The young woman
assured her that the- child was

feeling well, and that the child was u

just being evil. -
The elderly woman then caught
the child’s eyes with her own, put

    Radical Think: Alive

BY RICHARD GOLLUB
A recent study of the opinions
and attitudes of American youth
conﬁrms that the radical cultural,
social and political" questioning ﬁrst

expressed by college students in ,

the late 1960’s is today spreading
to increasing numbers of young
workers.

Numerous polls and studies in

V recent years have confirmed the

spread of radical attitudes to"
broader layers of the American
people, but this survey, conducted
by Daniel Yankelovich, Inc., is the
broadest so far. The sponsorship of

the survey by groups like the ‘

Mellon Foundation and the John D.
Rockefeller III Fund enabled
Yankelovich’s extensive research.
It is based on 3,522 one-to-two hour

interviews with Americans from 16 V

to 25 years old. Since it was
conducted in the spring of 1973, the
results can be assumed to
underestimate the degree of
radicalization, since they do not
reﬂect the full impact of Watergate
or the experience of the energy
crisis.

The Yankelovich survey begins by
saying, “These ﬁrst few years of
the decade of the 1970's point to

‘ vast changes in the complexion and

outlook of an entire generation of
young people.” The survey attri-
butes the causes of this change to
1) the impact of the Vietnam war;

2 and 2) ‘ ‘the diffusion of a set of new

values that incubated on the
nation’s campuses in the 1960’s
and have now spread out to /the
entire youth generation."

Here are some of the most
signiﬁcant ﬁndings" of the survey:
Politics, business, democracy

SGB Takes Command 7

-“...more than six out of 10 young
adults today believe that the
society is democratic in name only.
They believe that ‘special interests’
run the political machinery ,of the
nation, with little true participation
by the mass of American citizens.”

~-“Four out of five are critical of
the nation’s, foreign policy, and
predict that involvements similar to
Vietnam are inevitable.” ' A

-“More than 90% of all young
people ‘hold that business is too
concerned with its own proﬁts, and
insufﬁciently concerned with serv-
ing the public.”

' -“In 1969 only 24% of non-college
youth felt that big business needed
fundamental change. Today 45%
think big business needs reform or
elimination. ’ ’

-“In 1969, 44% of the noncollege
group believed that our political
parties needed fundamental
change. Today 64% hold this
.belief.” '

-“Among black, chicano, and
Puerto Rican youth, the prevailing
view is that this is a sick society
(55%) and not democratic (76%).
These youth feel this is a society of
rampant racism.” '

—Religion and sexual freedom
-The percentage of non-college _

youth who feel “religion is a very
important value” has gone down
from 64% in 1969 to 42% in 1973.

Among college youth it went down.

from 38 to 28 percent-.

-Sixty-one percent of students
want more sexual freedom, as do
47% of young workers, which puts
them where college youth were in
1969. .

-In 1969 a majority of working
youth ‘felt that abortion, relations

Government has great potential for such action, but until the new
Board took office, the potential was never fully realized. The new.
Board is now on top of the appropriation issue, and Pitt students will
not pay extra costs because the state ofﬁcials were unaware of our

concern .

But, for the Board’s actions to have aﬁect, students must attend
tornorrow’s organizational rally at David Iawrence Hall to show
support. Possible tuition increases and a cutback of programs are at
stake. Unless the Pennsylvania Legislature learns Pitt students will

her ﬁnger to her lips, and made a
shushing noise. The child quieted
for a moment or two, but began
crying once more.

-The next thing that happened was
strange. The child laid its head on
the young woman’s lap and the
young woman said, “Alright, you
can lay your head there, but don’t
bite my leg or you’ll get hit.”

The child stopped crying.

The reason I related this incident
to you, was to open a channel for
comment on a typical situation; one
thatwe have all either experienced
or dread experiencing.

I would appreciate any clues to the
roots of such a misfortunate
occurrence as the one described.

I would also appreciate any
far-fetched solutions to the
problem.

I already appreciate your printing

vWork..

Attitudes of young people .toward
their jobs are summed up by
Yankelov_ich as: “They want’
interesting and challenging work

but they assume their employers -
‘ cannot--or willnot--provide it. By

tlieir own say-so, they are inclined
to take ‘less crap’ than older
workers.” He says the higher
expectations and new values of
working youth “inevitably clash
with the built-in rigidities ofithe
traditional work place.”
Youth wants new bill of rights
One of the most signiﬁcant
ﬁndings of the Yankelovich survey
is the translation of young peoples

dissatisfaction into positive ideas of '

social and political change. Yan-
kelovich terms these ideas a ‘«‘Bill
of New -Rights” for the American
people. These are:

-“To be ableto send children to
college whether_ or not they can
afford to do so.”

-“To enjoy a secure retirement.”

-“To have access to the best
medical care whether they can
afford it or not.”

Stated in other words these “New
Rights” are: free education
through college; workers control of
production; social care of the aged;
and socializedmedicine. All these
goals run counter to the private
proﬁt system of capitalism. And all
of them are part of what the Young
Socialist Alliance stands for.

Just as it took mass struggles by
working people to win such rights
as free public education through
high school, and Social Security, so
it will take struggles to win these

TerHorst Details White House Resignation

BY KEN GORMLEY
JF terHorst, who rose to national
prominence when he resigned as
press secretary to President Ford
last September, has made it clear

/“S1-iis sole reason for quitting the post

was his conviction that Richard
Nixon should not have been par-
doned when he was.

This announcement dispelled
previous speculation that terHorst,
a White House reporter since the
Eisenhower days, resigned be-
cause President Ford led him to
believe there would be no pardon,
and he- subsequently resented re-
laying this faulty information to his
colleagues from the press.

terHorst told reporters, at a press
conference prior to his lecture at
uﬁquesne University last Thurs-

vid-ay, he ﬁrmly believed Nixon
should have been tried in a court of
law before a pardon was even
considered. This, said the ex-press
secretary, was the only reason he
left his job at the White House.

“I just could not accept the idea of
a pardon before the course of

underlings do.

President Ford’s former top press
aide told the Pitt News he had no
intention of resigning until the day
the pardon was announced, but he
has no regrets about the decision.

“I didn’t plan to leave. The
President had given me a good job,
and I was anxious to re-organize
the Press Office,” terHorst re-
called. “But I would have to do the
same thing if the same issue
confronted me again.”

wnoms?

terHorst quickly dismisses the
misconception he had quit because
President Ford violated his own
“open” press policy by leading
reporters to believe there would be
no pardon. -

He said as a reporter he under-

stood some decisions must always '

be made without prior indication to
the press, and his friends on the
Washington press corps were also
sure to understand it.

A long-time friend and great
admirer of President Ford, ter-
Horst regretted his decision to
resign had negative repercussions
for the President.

He admitted by vacating his post
as press secretary, the White
House reporters became more
skeptical of Ford's dealings with
the media. In this respect, he said,
“I hurt the man (President Ford),
although I didn’t intend to.”

However, terHorst said he has
visited the President three times
since his exodus from the White
House, and Ford is as cordial and
friendly as ever. “He’s just not a
bitter man by nature,” he said,
“and we were both disappointed
that I had to resign.”

columnist for the Detroit News is

more than happy with the Presi-
dent’s choice of another reporter,
Ron Nessen, to replace him as
press secretary.

“After seven years of Vietnam 0

and Watergate, the Washington
press corps almost didn’t believe a
thing. Only a member of the media

(acting as press -secretary) could_

pull the Press Department out,”
terHorst insisted. “So Ford should
be complemented for taking
Nessen as his press secretary.
There was great‘ pressure ‘not to
pick another guy like terHorst.’ ”

?’Dr. Myron Taube, Pitt English
§Professor. His teaching methods
ve. been praised, declaimed,
enjoyed, and indicted; his style is
!unique. Often dramatic, witty,
‘hsometimes verging on the burles-
‘fque, the way Taube conducts his

“Beginning his classes has become

Taube: Teacher With Style  

by his old students. “Some kids
get too caught up in the comedy of
the routine to catch what he’s
getting at.”

Drawing students out is often a
problem. Through demonstrations
or the enactment of scenes, Taube
hopes to bring the point across
more forcibly.

“Take a simple murder. Char-
acters X and Y,” Taube throws his

short story class, “X is dead, so Y

must have done it.”

“Not necessarily,” a student
breaks in, “Someone else could
have done it and blamed Y.”

“With only X and, Y as char-
acters?”

“But that’s no mystery!” the
student blurts.

“Son of a gun,” Taube looks at
him in mock amazement. “No-
body’s gonna fool you, are they?
You see?” to the class, “the plot
has got to have complications.”

He really works to bring a point
across—Taube’s one of the few
English professors who literally
work themselves into a sweat to get
their students involved. You
laugh at yourself—or at him— but
you come out of class remembering
the deﬁnition or point made.
“Sometimes it’s amazing how
much you can come away from his
classes knowing,” says one former
student.

Taube’s classes are not taught on
the I’ spur of the moment, but
planned out and follow a structural
pattern—a writing technique, the
introduction of a literary genre, an
author’s use of irony or language.

‘_‘Learn a word a day,” he shrugs
in class as he illustrates the
entymology of a word or phrase in
chalk. “Why? Language is

power.” He nodded and repeated

the phrase, deliberately. “Lan-
guage is power.”

“That’s right,” a student agrees,
nodding, “What’s more powerful
than words?”

“Actions.” Taube snaps. “Never
set me up.”

He’s a familiar figure around the
fifth floor of the Cathedral of
Learning: round sloping shoulders,
the bouncy stride when he walks,
hands in his back pockets, cap
pulled over his eyes.

Between classes, Taube can be
found in his ofﬁce—S17 E in the

sphere here, as in his classes, is
warm and informal.

“Marshall!” (Taube [always re-
members the name of his students,
sometimes to their chagrin) “No,
come in, come in.” He gets up and
moves some papers and junk mail
out of the way. “Sit down. Would
you like some tea? ‘OK. Hold on,
then.” He rummages across the
top of his desk, chooses a mug from
the several positioned there,
“You’ll get the cleanest cup-.—note
that it’s relative, not absolute,”
and leaves for a few minutes.

The room balances somewhere
along the scale between “sloven-
ly” and “easygoing.” Dr. Taube is
probably the only person who can
find anything on his desk, but the

shelves on the four walls surround- ix

ing his are filled with novels,
collections of short stories and
biographies arranged in alphabeti-
cal or. numerical order. Old
students correspond with him,
dropping cards and letters to let
him know how they’re doing
(“Good Doctor, Desolation, simply
desolation!”) and these are posted

on the wal between festoons of
Salada Tea “Fortunes of the Day.”
All in all, his office bears much
resemblance to that comfortable
old terrycloth bathrobe or pair of
shoes you’ll probably never throw
away. I

“OK.“ Taube returns setting the
mugs on the window ledge. He
rummages through a desk drawer
and pulls out an electrical gadget
which is thrust into one mug.
“What can I do for you?”

What he does is make you feel
welcome. He listens, offers advice

and always treats each person who 

comes to him as an individual. He
enjoys people.

“You have to remember that no
matter what your personal reac-
tions are to another’s goals or
ambitions, they’re still human and
deserving of respect.”

Why does he teach the way he
does? .

“Keep in mind, learningnshould
be a joy...” Taube gesticulates
with his hands. “It’s important to
read the text, to stick within the
framework of the text, and analyze
response to the text. Reading has '

 “Pcmtegleize"...Rinecir's Dramatic Pet

5/'\-5. \_wasn’t set to open for three months *

\ tr.

BY HARRIS LEVY

“Smile, Dave.”

“How can I smile when I just gave
a ﬁnal at 8 am on Friday the 13th
during a 2/3 eclipse of the sun?”
David Rinear replied.

Rinear, an associate professor in
Pitt’s Theatre arts division was
clearly excited about the eclipse.
Why? Because Pantagleize, a play
he is directing, takes place on a day
with a total eclipse. Pantagleize,
the story of an innocent man who
"nknowingly starts a revolution

but Rinear was deeply involved
with the preparations.

“You choose a play you’re going
to direct because it says something
to you,” Rinear commented.

Twentieth century directors are.‘

divided into two camps. If you take
a traditional text, is the director an
interpreter or co-creator? The
co-creators argue that a text is
cannon-fodder. You can chew it up
and spit it out. The director
imposes his concept, like what I did
to Scapin...my concept of what the
play could be.
“This one I feel differently
about,” he said referring to
—.Pantagleize. “As a battle-scarred
veteran of the foment of the ’60s I
feel very strongly about the play’s
ideas.” . _
Rinear explained what the direc-
tor does before rehearsals start.
“A lot of fundamental decisions
must be made,” he said as he lit a
match and tossed the pack on his

 desk.

Ideas are constantly. subject to
modification, Rinear continued.
“The people involved with the
show bring something to give.”

comedies‘. “Not the broad
slapstick element, though. There’s
always a distinct possibility that
something horrible will happen to
the main character.

“Farce has to be underplayed,”
Rinear said. “The actors aren't
standing outside the character--if
they are it’s impossible to make a
transition from the comic.”

In Pantagleize, the characters are
all archetypes and stereotypes.
“Tragedy inevitably deals with

archetypal ﬁgures while comedy‘

goes toward farce and stereo-
' types,” he said.

The difference between an arche-
type and a stereotype is that‘ the
former is serious and the latter is

comic. “A stereotype is just an
archetype cliched,” Rinear ex-
plained.

Rinear adjusted his swivel chair so
he could reach the phone and
answer the interofﬁce call. “Yeah,
True Grit Grainery...”

You choose a play you’re going
to direct because it says something
to you,” said Pantagleize director
David Rinear.

“My script fell apart 300 times,”
a hopeful actor lamented as he
waited for auditions to begin on a
grey, rainy afternoon.

David Rinear roamed the Stephen
Foster Memorial auditorium

Temps: Same

BY B. LAMBL

Sweat dribbled down their necks
into the folds of silk scarves as the
thirty-year-old performers spun
around under the lights. Their
carefully blended voices, however,
did not betray their exertion. They
repeated to the note, old arrange-
ments of Temptations songs. From
sweet Smokey Robinson songs like
“My Girl” to hard songs like
Norman Whitfield’s “Master-

piece,” it was the history of the
Temptations, of Motown, all over
again.

  
   

The Temptations as they whirled

Monroeville’s Holiday House.

Actually, only one of the original
five Temptations remains. The rest
are turnovers, people who replaced
Eddie Kendricks, David Ruffin and
the others as they left. But it
doesn’t matter, because they are
no more than voices to transmit a
particular sound. And the sound
has already been worked out by
songwriters, by engineers, by
producers, by Berry Gordy, Jr., by
Motown Recording Industries.

emptying ashtrays into a brown
paper bag. The stage was clear
except for a few folding chairs.
Pages from scripts were strewn on
the ﬂoor.

Rinear removed his green raincoat
and set his thermos and attache
case by one of the chairs. For the
next several hours he auditioned
actors vying for roles in the play,
his boot-clad legs ﬂung over the
back of the seat in front of him.

“I’m going to give you a set of
people, images, and ideas that I
associate with Pantagleize,”
Rinear called to an anxious actor on
the stage.

“Chaplin-Ferdinand the Bull-
Keaton-a nervous tightrope walker,
waiting for the sun to shine.”

In addition to reading lines,
Rinear told the prospective cast
members to walk across the stage.
“Did/ you ever see Gomer Pyle on
the tube?” he asked an actress
auditioning for Rachel. “You have
an image of this guy with a white
sidewall haircut who marches more
than he walks. I’ think there’s a lot
of that militant storm-trooper in
Rachel.”

Call-backs were held following

auditions. “One guy gave a pretty-

good reading,” Rinear said, ex-
plaining their value. “But when he
did the same scene ﬁve times, he
read it,the same way. He’s not
going to grow.” _

“It’s a mile a minute,” said Tom

There are so many. pressures,”
Bolton added.

She said that Rinear has wanted to
do Pantagleize for many years. “A
lot of his personal ideas. on
revolution and society are in-
volved.”

Bolton attributed some of the
harmony between cast members to
Rinear’s efficiency. “No one ever
loses their cool. So far, _we’ve had
none of the temper tantrums that
inevitably happen. People are
getting enough sleep.”

A barroom scene between four of
the revolutionaries was being
rehearsed. And the lack of
interplay between the characters
made the scenefall ﬂat.

Rinear stopped the rehearsal. “I
want you to imagine that this is
three years ago.” As if they didn’t

‘know each other well and hadn’t

planned "the revolution yet.
So, for half ‘an hour they

improvised.  plotted. And.‘
A came up with a revolutionary

slogan.
Finally they rehearsed the scene

again. This time there was real
camaraderie. And the scene
worked.

How does Rinear feel about the
show now, a week and a half before
it opens? “It’s going pretty much
the way I wanted it to,” Rinear
said.

“It’s hard to assess it properly
during tech week when you lay in
the lights and the sound. It’s
difficult to pay enough attention to
the actors and after you’ve seen it a
hundred times, objective evalua-
tion is hard.

Rinear remarked that improvisa-
tions are often misused in
rehearsals. , “Your improvisation
really served its function,” he said.
The camaraderie of the revolution-

aries has extended into other
scenes, too.

“Some of it’s improbable unless
done with real conviction.” _ The
actors felt good.

The last few weeks of rehearsal
are useful to the cast for developing
a sense of ensemble, according to
Rinear. “Now they can get to
watch each other’s stuff. I’ve
tried to be accessible to the cast.
At this point any tightening up are
movements that have to be slightly
reblocked to go with the sound and
the lights.-

“The cast is working hard and

there's a growing excitement,”
Rinear said. “The show looks the
way I wanted it to look. It’s pretty
much the show I had hoped for,”
he concluded.

Starting March 6, audiences will
get to see if Pitt’s Pantagleize is the
show they hoped for. ' '

A Cry for BetterVoices

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER
What this ‘city needs is a choral group worthy of singing with the fine

symphony orchestra we have here. Usually, the choir which sing”s‘wit—h."

the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is the Mendelsohn Choir, but it is
time to do something about this group. Either its membership should
be severely pruned, to get a smaller, more competent, dedicated
ensemble, or a totally new ensemble should be formed for the express

' purpose of singing in concerts with the Pittsburgh Symphony. I favor
the second option myself. ,

This group, in any case, should have enough funding so that every
member will get some payment as compensation for the giving of their
time and efforts. As it stands, one must pay to he in the Mendelsohn
Choir. This, of course, eliminates the incentive which might attract the
music students from several schools in this area. Funding would also
provide for the salary of a skilled .choral director, and, since the
members would be getting some_ monetary compensation for being in
the group, the director would be_able to make real demands on the
group in terms. of discipline and rehearsal time. Naturally, others who

either need a few extra bucks a month, or feel a little insulted at being ‘

asked to pay for the privilege of singing in a second-rate choir, would
be attracted to this symphonic choir. .

I came to this conclusion over a period of time, but‘ the last concert,
which featured the women’s voices of the Mendelsohn singers in
Debussy’s “Sirens’ ’ confirmed my belief beyond all doubt. The singers
were badly rehearsed. They did not even sing the syllable “ah”
properly. They had no idea what dynamics they were supposed to use.

They came in poorly or not at all in their entrances. The only thing I can 4

BY G. W. STEVENS

The Pitt basketball team will be
facing perhaps their weakest
opponent of the season when they
travel to Ohio tonight to meet the
Golden Flashes of Kent State
University. The Flashes are cur-

sf rently suffering their worst season

in ten years with a record of 4-18.
Head Coach Rex Hughes is only in
his first season as coach of Kent
State. Unfortunately for the Pep-
perdine graduate, his three return-
ing letter men have not performed
well this season, and are currently
plagued by a six game losing
streak. *

The Golden Flashes do play
somewhat better at home than they
do on the road. They have lost 22
straight road games but have
managed to win four of eleven this
year on their home ground. And

. several of their home'loses were
, decided by less than ﬁve points,

. .~>¢_.

“" such as their 52-50 loss to Mid

American Conference leader Mi-7

ami University one week ago.
Hughes, who came to Kent State
from Southern Cal where he was an
assistant coach, has attempted to
stress aggressive offensive and
defensive play. But the Kent State
squad has not taken to Hughes’
style of play and several starters
have suffered from. foul trouble
much of the season. ‘A
Only two members of the Golden
Flash squad have been averaging
in double figures this year. Tom
Brabson, a 6-3 junior guard from
Barberton, Ohio, is the top scorer

3 3-.-._ with an average of just 12.3 points.

77

‘He has improved somewhat over
last year when he managed an 8.7

Brabson’s backcourt mate is 6-2
senior /Ricky Gates, a native of
Dayton and Dunbar High School.
He has led the Kent State squad in
scoring for the past two seasons,
last year with a 13.2 average. He is
making a bid to add a third scoring
title this season and is currently
averaging 11.5 points.

At one forward position is 6-7
junior Bradley Robinson from
Akron, Ohio. He ﬁnished last
season as the nation’s second
leading rebounder with 423 caroms
for a 16.2 average. However, he
has fallen off somewhat this year to
an average of just 8.7 rebounds per

, game while averaging around nine

points.

Part of the reason for Robinson’s
decreased effectiveness on the
boards is sophomore Jim Zoet. At
7-0, Zoet is the tallest player in the
history of the Kent State team. He
has been playing at center which
required the moving of Robinson to
the forward slot. However, the
native of Port Perry, Ontario is
lacking in speed and agility and has
only played on a limited basis. Zoet
has a tendency to get in Robinson’s
way under the boards.

Despite their poor i"'ecord,- the
Golden Flashes pose a serious
threat to the Cats who have only
recently begun to play well on the
road. Kent State has upset four
teams on their ﬂoor, Penn State,
Ohio .U., Toledo and Ball State.
They also lost a_ one point decision
to Bradley back in December.

The Cats are expected to stick
with their usual starting line-up~of
Kirk Bruce, Keith Starr, Tom
Richards, Lew Hill and Melvin
Bennett‘ which has been so

_ Sports Editor j
The Pitt basketball schedule was put together by a genius. After the

Cats" got off to a dreadful 5-7 start, they have come on to win ten of their
last eleven games. The ﬁnal two games are against relatively weak
teams and the Panthers should easily ﬁnish with a respectable 17-8
record. V  l ' ‘ '
Pitt head coach Buzz Ridl obviously foresaw the need to insert his
young talent (Melvin Bennett and Larry Harris) in the line-up. With the
calibre of the opposition in the first half of the schedule (West Virginia

.5 A Minn their Coliseum, Duquesne.at the Arena, Duke and N.C. St. in
4‘ *«” Raleigh, Syracuse in the ‘Zoo’, and Marquette) the young duo was

E;

quickly exposed to the hardships of college basketball, and got some

valuable experience in a hurry. ' .

The tough opposition obviously had an effect on the more experienced
Cats as well. Keith Starr, Tom Richards, Kirk Bruce, and Lew Hill have
improved steadily and can now probably play well against just about
anybody in the college ranks. - - V

By the time the Cats hit the home stretch they were roll_ing. They had
already been in so many pressure situations that the Notre Dame,
Rutgers, and Virginia games were well suited to their style. And the
lesser teams’didn’t have a chance, especially‘ in Fitzgerald Fieldhouse
where nobody can top the Cats.

A team can only improve if it plays the best teams, which is what the
Cats have been doing. Harris and Bennett can now be considered
sophomores in the sense that they already have gotten enough
exposure for an entire season.

 ' The only game the Cats failed to win in the stretch was a

disappointing loss to the Gamecocks which wasn’t too, surprising,
considering the location of the contest. And if ‘Harris hadn’t been
injured in the first half and forced out of the game, he may have been
enough to reverse the outcome.

The Panthers are on their way to Morgantown forthe EC-AC Southern

A Division Playoff, although the bids won’t be given out until next week.

But it is doubtful that even a pair of losses at Kent State and Buffalo
could deny them a spot. Two wins would undoubtedly make them the
favorites. The Cats haven’t been able to beat the Mountaineers in the

j Coliseum, however. But the way they are playing now, maybe WVU’s

time has come, that is if they even make the tourney.

Phil" Musik of the Pittsburgh Press has started a nasty rumor involving
the Pitt ‘football team and their superstar of the future, Elliot Walker. It.
was reported in»th"e Sunday Press that the freshman running back was
considering transferring from Pitt to the University of Miami. The

‘v(:,:,g—-reason for the change was that ‘Walker was somewhat homesick and a

‘:"j[..,g:tle disturbed about his limited playing time last season,-especially

 

  

following his fantastic afternoon against Temple when he scored ﬁve
touchdowns and gained’over 160 yards._ V « -
Walker has supposedly met with head coach Johnny Majors and it is
still unknown exactly what his plans are at the present. Majors and
Elliot’s‘ brother Leverga, who is‘ also enrolled at Pitt, will now have the
task of attempting. to persuadethe speedysback to st'ay“in Pittsburgh.

back-up to Pitt’s greatest running back ever, T.D. Dorsett. -

There is the possibility that Majors could decide to put the two
speedsters in the same backﬁeld and go to the Veer offense. He has
already used it on occasion with varying results. There is another,
option open, however: a wishbone "attack. -

The personnel is there for at least a good wishbone backﬁeld. Robert
Haygood, who is a fantastic scrambler with suspect passing abilities,
would make a fairly good wishbone quarterback. His abilities are.
comparable to those’ of Ohio State’s Cornelius Green. And, at this time,
there really isn’t anybody else to‘ take Billy Daniels’ spot.

Without a doubt the halfbacks would be there. Walker and Dorsett in
the same backﬁeld would surely pose a problem for any defense. All

, that remains is for Majors to find a goodfullback, which is the key to

making the wishbone work. Bob Hutton did a pretty good job- last
season andjhas the best shot at the fullback’s job for next season.
Whethervhe would be effective in a wishbone offense remains to be
seen. i

The Veer option is the most likely of the two. I'm not quite sure if
Majors is an advocate of the wishbone attack. But after facing
Oklahoma while at Iowa State, he certainly must know what a well

A planned offense of this nature is capable. of.

Spring practice will get underway in the near future and hopefully the
problem will be resolved favorably by thenvbecause Elliot,Walker is
simply too good to lose. . ' .

But the Post Gazette has reported another rumor which complicates
matters and could cause the loss of Elliot and Leverga Walker from the
Pitt. squad. It has also been reported that these two Miami natives have
signed contracts with a- Miami attorney, Anthony Pace, who is a Pitt
alumnus. .

The basis of the agreement is that Pace will represent the brothers in
any future negotiations leading to professional" football contracts the
newspaper said. A contract of this nature is illegal in the eyes of the
NCAA and could lead to the suspension from college athletics of the
participating player. Pace is rumored to have enlisted several other

"college athletes from the ‘Miami area. '

It is still doubtful if the NCAA will ever suspend the Wglker brothers
since it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prove that a contract
exists which speciﬁes that Walker has entered into a legal agreement

’ with Pace. It is not illegal for a college football player to have his own

attorney, although it is hard to believe that he would actually need one.

So at least for the present, Walker is still a member of the Pitt football
team. It does my heart good to see the young man stir up a little
controversy. As the Oakland A’s have proved in the past two .years, a
little team dissent doesn’t pull the team apart too much and sometimes
has the opposite effect. If Walker phooses to stay at Pitt, he will
become involvedin a ﬁerce battle with Tony Dorsett for the number
one running back position. A little competition wouldn’t hurt either of

them. .

BY JIM SPANOS

It was 1973, and Pitt desperately
needed a man who could provide
immediate help. A man who could
ﬁght for those bounds, drive a-
gainst the man, play the amoeba
and the center position.

Pitt recruited an unheard-of
player, in Pittsburgh at least,
named Lew Hill, and he provided
the Panthers with the help they
needed. Last year he was the third
leading scorer on the team with
10.3 points per game, second
leading rebounder with 4.8 and
connected on 45% of his shots. He
was largely responsible for the

great season the Cats attained.

The 6'6” transfer from Ferrum
Junior College has had a rather
unusual type of year for the Cats in
1974-75_. After starting the first
three games, he was removed from
the starting lineup,’ only to regain
his position when Larry Harris was-
injured against South Carolina.

“A lot of people were wondering
why I was playing badly,” says
Hill, “but every athlete goes into a
slump at sometime in his career.
People knew what my capabilities
were from last year, and I think
they still respected me. I was just
trying to do too much_because I was

had to get together myself.”

He got it together well enough to
score 19 points at Syracuse, 13
against Notre Dame, 14 at Temple,
15 against West Virginia, and 17
against Niagara, and he has been
an integral part of the Panther’s
recent surge.

Coach Buzz Ridl, although not
always agreeing with Hill on vari-
ous issues, nonetheless acknow-
ledges the contribution which Hill
has- made.

“His all-around play has been
very good,” says Ridl, “and we’re
especially pleased with his overall
defensive play which stabilizes the
team.” Ridl, whose team has won
10 of their last 11, says “Lew

played real well against West

Virgina, although his back is
hurting him.”

team we play," he says. “We lack
the big man, and although Melvin
(Bennett) can hold his own, he has
to work extra hard to do it against a
bigger player. George Washington
may out-rebound us, but they
won’t be able to run with us.”

Hill has shot 42% from the ﬁeld

' this year, while shooting an un-

spectacular 61% from the free
throw line. Part of Hill’s earlier
difficulties can be attributed to “a
matter of not shooting well.” savs

“It depends on the’

 

Ridl, “but Lew’s shot selection has
improved because he’s been work-
ing on it in practice.”

The immediate future for Lew Hill
is of utmost importance; tonight’s
game at Kent State, Saturday at
Buffalo, March 7 & 8 at Morgan-

town, and hopefully onward to the .

NCAA tournament. After that?
“The way I’m playing now I think
I could get drafted in the pros,”
says Hill. “It would help if I could
play more, because the scouts look
at statistics and mine aren’t as
good as they could be. But‘ I'm
playing less than half a game.”

‘‘If I don't get drafted, I’ll

probably try out for the European

Basketball League,” says Hill.
Right. now he’s trying to cure an
ailing back. It’s the kind of injury
that heals best by giving it rest, but
one’s back certainly isn’t dormant
when playing basketball. Hope-
fully the treatments will enable him
to continue to play effectively.

Hill is probably the least under-
stood of the Pitt basketball players,
attributable to "various factors.
Unlike Keith Starr, he never smiles
while on the court. Many fans
thought it foolish for Hill to criticize
Ridl for not playing him, and others
got down on Lew because he has a
tendency to miss crucial layups,
though difﬁcult ones.

say on their behalf is that they stuck it out to the end of their
performance instead of ﬂeeing into the wings after a few lost

entrances, as I felt they might.

When l’ve heard this group at other concerts, it usually displays the
earmarks of a choir made up of a bunch of well-meaning music lovers
who simply do not understand that the only way. you achieve real
quality choral music is through long, hard practice, solid discipline,
many rehearsals, and talent to begin with. I have no way of knowing
how “talented” the group is, and, based on my own experience, I
wouldnjt place much importance on this factor anyway, so long as the
group has some entrance standards. However, the group almost
always has the muddled sound of the poorly rehearsed ensemble. Its
technique, therefore, is usually pretty bad. In short, it simply doesn’t
begin to approach the high standards of the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra, and should not be allowed to sing with them until it

dramatically improves.

Another reason prompts me to point out that the symphonic choir

I should be paid; it is simply a matter of respect to choral music. Choral

music is not one bit less legitimatethan orchestral music. It is quite
true that artistryis more concentrated in the competence of the director
than in orchestral music, but that doesn’t justify the patronizing
treatment that choral music gets here in Pittsburgh. We see the results
of it; there is not any large choir in the city which is really good enough
to sing in Heinz Hall. Choral music is not just for fun. You must work,
and work hard. Until the Mendelsohn group decides to stop being a
social club,‘ and start being a choir, they should not be_inﬂicted on the
public at Heinz Hall (or elsewhere) again.
