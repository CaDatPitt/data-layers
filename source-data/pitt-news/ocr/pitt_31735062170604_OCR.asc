Three Larcenies in Tower's

by KAREN BURGIO

Three larcenies. all involving
students housed in the Tower
Dorms. were reported over the
Thanksgiving recess.

According to the Campus Po-
lice, a television was stolen from
room 207lTower C. record albums
from 1910 Tower A, and close to
$600 worth of valuables from
1217 Tower A. . ‘

Kevin Joyce and Jamsp Jhab-

, vala, occupants of 1217, said-“that »

a stereo, 70 albums, a clock ra-

‘dio, alarm clock, trunk, check
' books and guitar were stolen from

their room sometime after 2 p.m.
Wednesday, Nov. 22. 1

The room had been locked after
the two left and the RA attested
to making sure the door was lock-
ed before leaving duty.

The room was not broken into
but rather entered with a key. ac-
cording to the Campus Police.

One of the occupants of the
room last year has told Joyce and
Jhabvala that his former room-
mate, a supposed drug addict, had

robbed him of $140 of goods. He‘

added that his former roommate
had reportedly lost his key and
attained a second one to the room.

Jhabvala and Joyce have taken
the matter to the Legal Aware-

ness Committee, but Police re-.

port there are no suspects.

The Legal Awareness Commit-
tee is investigating the possibility
that the University ma_y be negli-
gent. When. keys have'been lost or
not turned in. the University has
not always changed the locks even

Dr. Goldsmith Featured

. by MONICA A. CIROCCO.

Dr. Marilyn Goldsmith of the
biology department. was the fea-
tured speaker at a colloquim on

abortion sponsored by Women's

Studieson Nov.10.V

Based on her experience as a
pregnancy counselor for Pitts-
burgh Free Clinic. Goldsmith iden-
tified three options fora pregnant
woman: she can give birth and
keep the child; terminate the
pregnancy; or give birth and give
the child up for adoption.

Goldsmith ‘vehemently dispell-
ed the notion that abortion is an
easy decision for a woman to’
make, “In’the two years as_a
counselor, I haven’t found one
woman that thought it was an easy
decision; it is one you can’t pos-'
sibly-make beforehand.” _

Goldsmith later explained the

history of the abortion issue in Al- '

legheny County, citing‘ in particu-
lar the "Miller, Meyer, Feingold"
case where District ‘Attorney
Robert’Duggan charged the three
doctorsof conspiring to p,erform
an illegal abortion at Magee Wom-
en's Hospital. Judge Anne X. Al-
pern. dismissed the case on -the
grounds that the abortion law in
Allegheny County. stating that no
one can perform an illegal abor-
tion, was declared unconstitution-
al and the hospital could not re-
lease any records. Duggan did not
appeal the case.

C‘ A this point Goldsmith inter-

jected. "The real question .1s:
shall we have sale -or back-alley
abortions; women will have them

whether it is legal or_not and they "

should have access to safe abor-
tions."

The discussion turned to House
«Bill 800 and its history..Martin
Mullen, an antiabortionist from
Philadelphia, first proposed the
bill which said that no abortions

_ could be given for any reason. It

has since been amended to read
that no abortion can be given ex-
cept to save the life of the wom-
an. In addition, stipulations have
been added stating that three doc-
ust concur and'approve.th_e

 

    

    

   

lfective contraceptives,

     

At Abortion Colloquium

Goldsmith sees Mullen as a ma-
jor power figure in the state leg-
islature. emphasizing that» he is
the main spokesman for the Cath-
olic Church and controls the purse
strings in ‘the House Appropria-

- tions Committee.

She also commented on two of

i the state senators. Frank Mazzei

and Stanley Noszka. who were ap-
proachéd about the abortion is-
sue. She called Mazzei a "pomp-
ous pig." and said that when he
was asked if he would vote in fav-
or of taking the issue to the peo-
ple in the formof a referendum.
he said he would, but that the out-
come would be binding. Goldsmith
disagreed that the result would be
binding. '

Moving to Noszka, she quoted
him as saying, “Girls should cook
and have babies,” adding that he
claims there are 100 per cent‘ef-
but he
wouldn’t say what they are. He
also said he wasn’t sure if he
would vote for a public referen-
dum. '

Dr. Goldsmith concluded by
emphasizing that telegrams are
needed to show the representa-
tives where their constituents

stand and encouraged students
and others to write.

though they have been assessing
residents a $10 fee to cover the
cost of the lockchange.

Richard Gaston of room 207
Tower C said that his room also
was locked, but that he had allow-
ed a friend to borrow his room
key earlier in the year, and could
have duplicated it.

Robert ‘Wine of 1910 Tower A

‘ feels that his room was entered

by a pass or master key. and that
the University should be respon-

sible for making sure these oc— ‘

curances don‘t happen, especially
during vacations. "I don't trust
the University.” he said.

Edwin Peterson Dead

FRED STORASKA spoke to women Monday night in the MCNR Ballroom
and the llth floor lounge of Holland Hall. His lecture, titled ‘fTo Beor
Not to Be Raped,” sponsored by the Women's Housing, Board, cited ways
for women to defend themselves in the event of an attack: “scream to
attract-attention, kick him in the groin, and carry an umbrella to use as’:

/ Noted Writing Professor Dies

Edwin L. Peterson. for 40 years
a professor of English at Pitt and
one of the best known and most
celebrated teachers of creative
writing in the country. died on

Nov. 24 after a-brief illness. He.

was 68.

Professor Peterson, or "Pe‘te.”’
as he was known to most of his
students, joined Pitt’s faculty as
a graduate assistant in English in
1927 and remained there until

his retirement in 1967. He earned

his bachelors and master’s de-
grees from Pitt-.

He founded the first writing ma-

jor, as opposed to a literature ma-
jor, in the country at Pitt in the
1940s. Every year, except when

- he took a year’s leave of absence

to serve as a visiting professor at
the University of Colorado, his
students took top writing prizes
in national competition."

Some of his more famous stu-
dents include the late Gladys
Schmitt (Rembrandt, David the
King, Gates of Aulis, Alexandra,
Confessors of_the Name, The Per-
sistent Image, A Small Fire, and
Electra), Peter Beagle (A Fine
and Private Place and The Last
Unicorn), Robert Musser Brown
(Brother, Which Drummer?), and
Lester Goran (The Paratrooper
of Mechanic Avenue, Maria Light,
The Candy Butcher’s Farewell,
The Stranger in the Snow and
Keeper of Secrets). Peter Beagle

In 1958, Professor Peterson’s

students took first, third. fourth,-

and fifth places in an. Atlantic

Monthly contest for college short A

‘story writers. Shortly thereafter,

Edward Weeks, editor of the At- ’

lantic Monthly, singled Professor
Peterson out in his book In
Friendly Candor as one of the best
writing teachers in the country.

Drl. Montgomery Culver, a

' former student of Peterson and an

-English professor at Pitt, said
that “Pete was a good critic, but
his forte lay in the clas,sroom—in
his personality," and in the atmos-
phere he developed successfully.”

Professor Peterson’s own pub-
lished works include Contempor-

ary Composition (1963), Penn’s,

Woods West (1958), Hidden Stream
(editor, 1950), Introduction to
Victorian Prose (1942). No Life

American Crew Member

Explains RA P Expedition

He noted the two hurricane sea-
sons the members of the interna-
tional crew were up ag_ainst—one
set of storms that plague the Afri-
can coast, beginning in March and
the other hitting the Eastern
American coast in April and May.
He added that bothrudders were
lost on the second attempt, the Ra
II.

The first vessel, the Ra I was
lost in a storm soon after the
crew had abandonded it. The Ra
II will soon be found in the Ra Mu-
seum in Oslo, Norway, next to
Kow Tiki, the balsa raft which
Heyedahl sailed from Peru _to
Tahiti.

The Ra expedition crew consist-
ed of eight sailors, each from a
different country. "and represent-
‘ed different societies, religions,
and races.

Baker added that because of the

man could have traveled from the

that this does not prove this event

The first attempt at crossing -
the ocean on a small ship from
Safi, Morocco’, to Barbados, in the
Carribbean, ended in defeat after
traveling 2,700 nautical miles.
Baker explained that the tructur-
al requiuements needed for a ves-
sel to make such a trip across the
ocean were not understood and

. hence the windward side of the

boat was overloaded. Weather,
too, was quite bad—the worst

CAS Cabinet Takes

Complaints on Racism, Sexism

Advisors

At its Nov. 20 meeting the CAS

Cabinet voted to set up a proce-

dure whereby students may file
complaints of racism and sexism
in their coursework. Several de-
positories were established for
this purpose at the Student Gov-
ernment office, 305 SU; the SDS
office, 509 SU; and the BAS of-
fice, 420 SU.

Termed Inadequate

The Cabinet recommened that
the guidelines by which itlwill af-
fect its judgments be constructed
in conjunction with the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences.

Ron Eskin, Cabinet-chairman,
suggested that “positive action
can be taken on all complaints
next term, when the continuity of
our new structure will enable us

Family Planning Center
To See Facilities Move

On Dec. 1', 1972, the Hill District"
Branch of Planned Parenthood
Center of Pittsburgh will move to
the new Hill House Multi-Purpose
Neighborhood Center at 1835 Cen-
ter Ave. '

The move from the former lo-
cation, at 1919 Center Ave., is be-
ing made in keeping with Planned
Parenthood Center’s philosophy
that family planning services
should be an integral part of com-
prehensive health care whenever
possible.

Counseling services for prob-
lems centering around marriage,
human sexuality, the family,
youth, and interpersonal rela-
tionships will be available.

Across the hall from the new
Planned Parenthood facilities will
be an obstetrical-gynecological
clinic administered by Mercy
Hosipital. Arrangements have
been made with, this staff to pro-

vide follow-up treatment for med-
ical_conditions found during ex-
aminations of patients at the
Planned Parenthood clinic, if they
desire it. -

The new family planning serv-
ices are being administered by
Planned Parenthood Center of
Pittsburgh.

to handle problems which entail
research.”

The Cabinet also declared, by a
9-1 margin, that advisors com-
ment cards should be abolished.
The typical position was stated by
junior Al Watterson, “The advi-
sors are not fulfilling their func-
tion by includinginformation to-
tally unrelated to.. satisfying the
need for advides."

BAS Chairman Albert Wynn
added, “Perhaps advisors would

not be so willing to comment on t " ’
the student’s character to govern-
' mental and industrial institutions’

if they didn’t have that little; card
before them.” Some departments
have kept the card after a stu-
dent’s graduation for purposes of
recommendation.

The Cabinet felt that advisors
had insufficient contact with the
student to make decisions about
him. Atpresent, all students in
CAS have the right to demand to
see their comment card.

Con Artist Swindles
Unsuspecting Students

by MYRA SUGARMAN

A man posing as a Pitt assistant professor has conned money from -

several students on campus with the excuse that he has run out of

gas. doesn’t have his wallet, money, or license, and will pay them back:
Students have tried to find him at the address he gave but have al- "

ways reached a dead end.

Kurt Graham, a detective employed by the campus police, contact-
ed the Legal Awareness Committee after students had notified him.

Jeff Pasek, chairman of the Legal Awareness Committee, said,’
"This is the most unusual con job we’ve seen at the LAC. Students are '
put into the position where they either help their professor and get. . .,_1~
taken for a few dollars or refuse to help and run the risk of finding "

out he really was an assistant professor who they have next term. I

would suggest if anyone encounters this suspect they contact the Cam-I ‘ ill I

pus Police immediately at extension 7345.

Judge Bans Juvenile Court Reports I

by MILTON w. MINARCIN
Associated Press Writer

ERIE, Pa. (AP )—An Erie Coun-

” ty juvenile court judge says he is
. standing by his threat to find the

Corry Evening Journal in con-
tempt if it prints anything about
proceedings in his court without
his specific prior consent.

In so doing, the judge apparent.-
ly is abandoning an agreement he
reportedly made with the news-
paper just six weeks ago in which
he promised to rescind the threat,
embodied in la stiffly worded judi-
cial order. ,

The‘ order became the focal
point of one of Pennsylvania’s
most widely publicized controver-
sies pitting a branch of the gov-
ernment against the constitution-
al guarantees of a free press and
due process. For its part in the
controversy, the Evening Journal
recently was given a Freedom of
Information Award by the Nation-
al Associated Press Managing
Editors Association.

The judge. Fred P. Anthony,
commented on the situation
through his secretary in response
to an inquiry about the reported
agreement. Anthony refused on a
half-dozen occasions to speak
with newsinen himself. His secre-
tary said he was too busy. 1

"The judge says he is unaware

of any movement in the Corry sit-

uation." the secretary said when
queried about the agreement.

When asked whether this meant
Anthony’s order still was in force-,
the secretary hesitated, then
said:

"Yes. the judge says nothing
has changed since the order was
issued and that it is still in force."

Anthony filed the order against

5 the Journal six months ago after

the. newspaper carried a six-para-
graph story reporting that the
judge had dismissed charges
against a young girl accused of
passing drug-laced chewing gum
to an acquaintance at Corry High
School '

Similar stories were carried by
other area' news outlets. They
were not served with an order,
however. Courthouse sources said
the order against the Journal
came after Anthony received sev-

    McGoVem Supporters
Keeping the Faith

by PATRICK DiSANTE

I have written this articlerin rebuttal to the open letter to Mc-
, Govern supporters written by George Zrust in the November 15

Pitt News.

The reason.why McGovern—Shriver buttons are still being dis-
played by students is that they are telling everyone that McGov-

.ern’s defeat doesn't constitute a lost cause. They are living in ‘a real
vworld where human beings are still being killed in Indochina. a

world where poverty and misery still exist, a world where equality
of condition andgequality of opportunity are advocated. but not
practiced. ‘This is the real world. and anyone-who doesn't believe
that these things exist are the ones who are living in a dream

world.

There were several discrepancies stated in the Zrust letter con-

cerning the elections of 1972 and 1964. I feel it is my responsi-
bility as a McGovern supporter to correct these discrepancies.

 First of all, the writer stated that “the many Democrats who won

" other races obviously appeal to normal party voters’ morethan Mc-
 Govern ever did.” This is a very interesting point since the biggest
' ',; Senatorial upsets which occurred were won by four liberal Demo-

crats: Floyd K. Haskell in Colorado, Joseph R. Biden, Jr. in Dela-

ware, Dick Clark in Iowa, and William D. Hathaway in Maine. I
, repeat, these were LIBERAL senators, and if my memory serves me
 correctly, the term liberal was also used to describe Senator Mc-

’ f;Govern’s policies. As a result, the Senate as a whole is considered
to be more LIBERAL in its makeup for this session than it was

for the last session.

 It was alsopointed out in the open letter that Senator McGov-
 ern’s defeat was “a more inglorious defeat" than Senator Goldwater’s
defeat. I don't see how a person could make such totally inaccurate

statements. Nixon received 60.7 percent of the popular vote in 1972

 compared to Johnson’s 61.1 in 1964. After the Johnson landslide,

"the Democratic majority in the Senate was 68 to 32; the House of

 Representatives was 295 to 140 in -favor of the Democrats. In the
.. governors’ races the Republicans won only eight out of 25. After
the Nixon landslide, the Republicans still trailed in the Senate 57-

43, still trailed in the House 244-193 (one seat is stil

undecided),

 and trailed in governorships ‘31-19. So, I think that the facts show
i_ , that the Democratic candidates defeat wasn't nearly as disastrous
« V as Goldwater's defeat.

Now, I’ll address myself to the last paragraph of the letter which

 

;:._—»_I thought was utterly repugnant, childish. and vindictive. I don’t
_ think Senator McGovern’s ideas were wrong for America, wrong

3 2’ for the Democrats, or just plain wrong. I will continue to hold these
views no matter how many idiotic open letters are written to Me-

_ Govern supporters in the Pitt News. I, resent very strongly being

7}: told to work “without" the system. because I love my country very

 much and I will continue to support people who I feel will enable
 this country to truly become "the land of the free.“ But. I guess
 some people can‘t understand what it is like to love ones country
  .and its people.

A Heck of a Thing

by GEORGE ZRUST

I make a practice of at least
scanning the Letters To The Edi-
tor section of the Pitt News.
even though on occasion it means
subjecting myself to a storm of
leftist hogwash. Yet, of all the
letters that spout the rhetoric
of the left, the ones that continue
to stick in my mind are the ones
that contain a copious share of
obscenities.

Admittedly. letters of this type
form a minority. but they con-
tinue to appear t'rom time to
time, and I continue to read
them whenever they do. Still.
I fap to grasp the reasoning be-
hind using these famous_. some-
times infamous. “four-letter
words" in print.

Somewhere along the way, I've
been taught that the printed
word is more precise than the
spoken word. There is a cer-
tain amount of wisdom in this.
Aside from prepared speeches,
which are basically written any-
way, no great amount of planning
goes into vocal expression of
one’s thoughts; the exact words
are too easily forgotten to worry
about others’ close analysis of
them. But when a person’s
thoughts are put onto paper, they
are stationary and unchanging,
subject to great scrutiny if the
reader so desires. Therefore,
when most people set out to
write down their ideas, they try
to express them as eloquently
and clearly as possible, so that
they may stand up to this scru-
tiny. Apparently this doesn’t hold
for some fire-breathing idealogues
of the left. ’

They don't realize that "swear-
ing” is a pretty common thing.
being used quite often to fortify
something in conversation or in
writing. If, however, nothing is

being said to begin with. and the

obscenities are of questionable
relevance, the words are mere

will ever be effective in doing
so. _ _

It is quite untrue that student
opinions or so—called “polls”
were ignored during the tenure
deliberations. All available infor-
mation about the candidates was
meticulously collected and care-
fully considered.‘ While the stu-
dent opinions may not have pre-
vailed, they were certainly not
ignored. It should be clearly
understood that in addition to
undergraduate student opinion,
graduate student opinions were
gathered, letters from colleagues
and former professors of the can-
didates were solicited, as well as
information from colleagues with-
in the university. In fact, the
candidates themselves could
place in their “package” any in-
formation they regarded as rele-
vant. -

The assertion that during vyin-
ter term registration “nearly 100
students could not be placed in
any biology course” is simply
not true. Also. we have about
500 majors. not 600 as stated.
Neither is it true that “many
students‘. . . could not take the
courses they needed to complete
their major.“ Scheduling is tight
in biology due to several things.
One of these is a shortage of
laboratory space. There is cer-
tainly not a luxury of courses and
the faculty teaches a'small list of
offerings because we have
such a heavy subscription and

one of the smaller faculties in,

this university. Nevertheless. I

banalities. attracting attention
for a split second and no longer.

This attention-oriented deliv-
ery characterizes left-wing coin-
mentaries that try to emotion-
ally convince readers of the
racist. fascist. anti-socialist ‘na-
ture of our country and its lead-
ers. The obscenities certainly do
stand out, although only because
they are surrounded by a sea of
verbal slop. Worn-out leftist
phrases. requiring no thought on
the part of the writers. make up
the bulk of letters that supposed-

ly give an original viewpoint.
Meaningful vocabulary is -cast
to the wind. and even four-let-
ter words look refreshingly new.

As I said before. I will never-
theless continue to read this type
of commentary, without blushing
or feeling surprised. I will. though.
wonder whether I should laugh
at these unfortunate people. or
just pity their lack of writing
skill. I only hope that these left-
wing rhetoricians never gain any
kind of status in this country-
that would be a heck of a thing.

do not know of any student who
has been forced into retirement
because he tshei coule not fin-
ish a major.

Somehow. the above assertion
is supposed to relate to the ten-
ure situation. It has no connec-
tion whatever.

The statement that the three
tenure candidates “have handled
more than their share of the

_ teaching load in the department”

deserves to be challenged. It
could at best be supported in
only one of the cases. It is true
that handling a class of 600 stu-
dents can be a damanding job.
In recognition of this, people
in this department charged
with- such obligations ordinarily
have a proportionately large
share of the graduate teaching
assistants to man their lab sec-
tions plus one or more full-time
assistants to supervise the labor-
atories and aid with examinations.
Furthermore, the great majority
of the Biology faculty teach one
or two courses a year that con-
tain 150 to 200 students in addi-
tion to one or more smaller cours-
es. There is not a lot of differ-
ence between handling 200 stu-
dents and 600 students when a
proportionate number of asstants
are provided. I believe that most

"of the courses taught in this de-

partment are taught by people
who want to teach them. I have
seen little evidence of coercion.
Senior faculty teach several of
the large courses; the junior "fa-

culty do not inherit a dispropor-

tionate share of the teaching.
Furthermore, there are some
members of this faculty who put
in their, hours teaching, super-
vise the program of several grad-
uate students, carry on grant-
supported research, participate
in the operation of national bio-
logical societies, and fill paren-
tal and community roles as well.

Finally your report attempts to
fuel one of the favorite beliefs
frequently held by
namely that research and teach-
ing are incompatible. There are
people who are supposedly good
in research and indifferent as
teachers; I know some like that.
But I also know even more who
are splendid teachers and lion-
ored researchers. The two quali-
ties are mutually exclusive; in

fact, I‘ would argue that they area

erage. It may be most unwise
for undergraduates to demand a
faculty that is exclusively or
chiefly concerned with their in-

be a parochial. comfortable and
insulated 4-year-romp. That kind
of “education" is readily avail-
able at dozens of American
colleges. A university of any im-

Editor's Note: This article is an
abstract from a 50 page booklet
written by Samuel Moon for the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
in 1971 while he was serving on
the Interracial Justice Commis-
sion.

by SAMUEL L. MOON

American racism probably‘ ori-
ginated in slavery, the most ex-
treme form of subordination by
color. That type of racism, and
all other later types, came. into
being mainly because subordin-
ation of black people provides
definite benefits to those who do
the subordinating. In fact, overt
racism persists mainly because
it still yields significant psycho-
logical. economic. and political
advantages to millions of white
Americans—-and even to a few
nonwhites.

Successful efforts to combat

eliminate these benefits; thereby

/imposing a significant cost upon

people who now enjoy them. That
is why attempts to combat ra-
cism have been so strongly resist-
ed. Moreover, such resistance
is far more widespread than most
people realize because so many
whites receive significant but
only dimly realized benefits from
the subordination of non-whites.
Even many whites who sincere-
ly abhor racism in principle, and
openly combat overt racism, some-
times find themselves resisting
clearly antirac-ist actions for "in-
tuitive" reasons they do not fully
understand. This usually means

~‘5'55uch antiracist actions threaten to

‘reduce certain almost subcon-
sciously perceived psychological

' benefits these whites have been

gaining from living in a society
where they are considered mem-
bers of a “superior” group.

A necessary step.in weaken-
ing this . widespread but unex-
pressed support for racism is
clearly identifying the benefits
which whites receive from con-
tinued subordination of black
people. True, some whites will
still resist losing these benefits
even after they realize that such
benefits result from unjust sub-
ordination. But, hopefully, many
whites who are opposed to overt
racism in principle will begin to
see how they have been profiting
unawares from either overt racism
or institutional subordination or
both—and will therefore begin sup-
porting the antiracist strategies
set forth later in this analysis.

ECONOMIC BENEFITS
DERIVED FROM RACISM A -

Overt racism and institutional
subordination provide the fol-
lowing economic benefits to a
significant number of whites:

1. Reduction of competition by
excluding members of certain
groups from access to benefits.
ﬁrivileges, jobs, or other oppor-

tunities or markets. The ability
to easily identify members of
the subordinated group by sight
is a key factor linking such reduc-
tion of competition to color. An
example is the refusal of many hos-
pital medical staffs to accept
Negro or Mexican American doc-
tors as staff members.

2. Exploitation of members of
the subordinated groups through
lower wages,vhigher prices, high-
er rents, less desirable credit
terms, or poorer working or, liv-
ing conditions than those receiv-
ed by whites. Where racisl or
color discrimination per se is
illegal, such exploitation probably

  

unless the subordinated groups
are spatially segregated from the
white majority. Then differen-

tials in wages, prices, credit
terms, and other policies actually
based upon color can be more
easily concealed and even ration-
alized as based upon geographic
differences.

3. Avoidance of certain unde-
sirable or “dead-end” jobs tlike
garbage collectioni by creating

’,economically depressed racial or

ethnic groups which will be com-
pelled by necessity to carry out
those jobs. even though their
potential skill levels are equal
to those of other groups.

POLITICAL BENEFITS
DERIVED FROM RACISM .

All the political benefits of ra-
cism involve receipt bywhites
of a disproportionate share of ad-
vantages which arise from politi-
cal control over government.
Their share is disproportionate
because they prevent nonwhites
from receiving what the latter

would get if true political equal-

ity prevailed. The benefits of
political control over government
include ability to control govern-
ment actions and policies as
well as jobs. Therefore. political
racism is an extremely import-
ant device formaintaining other
forms of racism.

The main ways political ra-
cism occur are as follows:

1. Manipulation of potential
nonwhite voters in order to main-
tain exclusive white control over

‘ an entire governmental structure

«such as a county government in
the South), or some portion of
such a structure (such as a ward
in a northern cityi. which would
be controlled by nonwhites if all
citizens -enjoyed equal voting
rights. since nonwhites are a ina-
jority of the potential electorate
in thatarea. -

2. Manipulation of political
district boundaries or govern-
mental structures by whites so
as to mimimize the ability of
nonwhite voters to elect repre-
sentatives sensitive -to their‘
needs. This includes “gerryman-
dering" congressional districts,
creating “at-large” electoral sys-
tems in big cities with significant
nonwhite minorities, and shifting
to metropoljtanwide government
when nonwhites appear likely
to constitute a majority of voters
in a central city.

.3. Exclusion of nonwhites from
a proportionate share——or any share
——of government jobs, contracts.
and other disbursements through
the decisions of white adminis-
trative officials.

4. Maintenance of the support
of nonwhite votersby either white
or nonwhite politicians who fail
to provide reciprocal government
policy benefits and other advant-

ages to the same. degree. as for,

/ tablished American

s gr ups...

  

white groups in the electorate.
This can occur when nonwhites
as a group feel themselves too
subordinated in general to de-
mand such benefits, when com-
petitive parties are somehow ex-
cluded from effective operation

_ in all-nonwhite areas, or when

voters are so poor they can be
influenced by small monetary re-
wards and favors.

5. Voter refusal to support a
politician who is clearly superior
to his opponent merely because
he is not a member of the same
racial or color group asthe vot-
ers themselves and his opponent
is. This kind of racism can also
occur among nonwhite voters
in relation _to a white politi-
cian. Even though basing votes
on group solidarity is a long es-
tradition,
it must be considered racist if
it subordinates any candidate sole-
ly because of his race. color. or
ethnic background.

PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS
DERIVED FROM RACISM

Both overt racism and institu-
tional subordination provide the
following psychological bene-
fits to many whites in America:

1. Creation of feelings of super-
iority in comparison to non-
whites. These feelings are ex-
tremely widespread among whites,
though notalways openly expres-
sed or even consciously recog-
nized. Hence it is important to
examine their true implications.
All whites who gain ego support
from feeling superior to non-
whites basically believe that non-
whites are somehow inherently
or biologically inferior because
of their color. This is the “pur-
est” form of racism. It is so bla-
tantly “un-American” that few
whites will admit they believe
it——or even consciously accept
it. Yet all whites who feel the
least bit superior to nonwhites
as pers_ons—in contrast to believ-
ing they live in environmental
surroundings superior to those of
nonwhites—basically adopt such a
“pure” racist viewpoint. This is
true because the obviously in-
ferior economic, political, and
social statusof nonwhites can
result from only two factors.
Either nonwhites are inferior as
persons, or white racism has
prevented their natural equality
with whites from asserting itself
in actual attainments during
their more than 300 years in Amer-
ica. Therefore, whites who deny
that overt racism and institution-
al subordination are essentially
responsible for the currently
lower status of nonwhite groups
are basically implying that those
groups are biologically or other-
wise inherently inferior. ’

2. Suppression. in oneself or
one’s group of certain normal
traits which are regarded as un-
desirable. This is accomplished
by projecting an exaggerated
image of those traits and "legiti-
mizing" attacks upon them. For
example. many American whites
unjustly accuse Negroes of lazi-
ness, sexual promiscuity. and gen-
eral irresponsibility. These are
exaggerated versions of normal
human impulses. But they happen
to be the very impulses which the
Puritan, ethic. long dominant in
America. seeks to suppress in favor
of extreme industry; sexual purity,
and individual self—reliance.

3. Promotion of solidarity and
reduced tension among white na-
tionality and social class groups.
Racism enables them tofocus the

"inevitable hostilities and antagon-

isms which arise in modern life
upon the subordinated black
groups. and to identify themselves
together in contrast to those

   

are bound to produce__anxieties—

Analysis of Racism and Its Benefits

4. Avoiding the necessity of
adopting difficult of costly poli-
cies to solve key social problems
by falsely blaming those prob-
lems upon "immoral behavior"
by members of the subordinate
groups. For example, many whites
erroneously blame unemployment
and high welfare costs upon lazi-
ness and sexual promiscuity among
Negroes. In reality, more than
three-fourths of all unemployed
persons are white. most persons
on welfare are white, and more
than 90 percent of all persons on
welfare are incapable of support-
ing themselves because they
are either too old, disabled,

‘children, or mothers who must

care for children. By falsely con— _
verting these problems into "the
results of sin,” such scapegoating
provides a moral excuse for rela-
tively affluent whites .to reduce
their economic support for the
unemployed and the dependent
poor without feeling guilty about
doing so.

i 5. Diverting one’s own ener-
gies from maximum self-improve-
ment efforts by claiming that
white racism makes any signifi-
cant self-help attempts by black
people ineffective and useless.
Such “reverse scapegoating” oc-
curs—often unconsciously—among
many minority group members. It
is possible only because white ra-
cism does seriously inhibit-
though not entirely nullify— non-
whites selfimprovement efforts.
This phenomenon can lead to
two opposite results: excessive
apathy or suicidal violence. Thus,
by helping to create such “re-
verse scapegoating,” white ra-
cism encourages some nonwhites
to exhibit two of the very charac-
teristics— “laziness” and tenden-
cies toward violence—that it often
falsely attributes to all nonwhites.

REINFORCEMENT OF RACISM
BECAUSE OF HEIGHTENED
ANXIETIES IN MODERN

' SOCIETY ‘V

Recent events have emphasized
the rising level of tensions, anx-
ieties. and other- psychologically
threatening factors in modern
American life. These things re-
sult from acombination of rapid
technological change; high eco-
nomic productivity; instant and
universal communication of
problems; dissent and prevailing
affluence through television; and
the interia and rigidities of legal
and social institutions. The ways
in which these‘ basic causes
interact are too complex to explore
fully here. But their net effect is
to heighten the needs of many
whites for precisely the kinds of
psychological benefits that racism
provides.

For example, television has fo-
cused great attention recently upon
the new lifestyle expoused by “hip-
pies." This style features drugs,
hostility toward authority, sexual
freedom, unorthodox styles of
dress. rejection of work as a cen-
tral value, and willingness to en-
gage in violent protests and demon-
strations. These traits pose power-
ful psychological threats to many
Americans. They are a direct threat
because they imply that the values
ipon which most middle class
.amilies have built their lives are
really worthless. Moreover, “hippie
values also threaten to "seduce”
middle class children, causing pro-
found cleavages between them
and their parents. These values
are also an indirect threat because
they appeal to the suppressed de-

sire of every normal person to .

enagge in such activities to some
degree. Thus. they may weaken
the adherence of, middle class

4 citizens to their existing values.

Such psychological threats

  
   

both conscious and unconscious-—
among many of the middle
class Americans who form the vast
majority of our population. One
way to cope with such heighten-
ed anxiety is to lean more heavily

upon the psychological benefits 

which can be derived from ra-
cism. This can take the form of
more vociferously blaming social
problems upon minority groups,
or projecting traits one wants to
suppress in oneself upon mem-
bers of such groups, or gaimng

feelings of solidarity with other fl. 

whites by uniting in greater«an-
tagonism against nonwhites, or
emphasizing the inferiority of

others so as to reassure oneself it

about one’s own worth. Conse-
quently, powerful recent trends
in American life may be signifi-
cantly increasing the depend-
ence of many whites upon the
psychological benefits they de-.
rive from racism, whether con-
sciously or unconsciously. Unless‘

the anxieties caused by these ‘ I

trends can be alleviated in other
ways, it may be increasingly dif-
ficult to get these whites to give

up such benefits. This suggests - 

that antiracism strategies must

"include, or be linked to, policies

that will help reduce the threat-
ening nature of these recent trends
to the white middle class.

‘The fact that overt racism‘ and I

institutional subordination pro-
duce benefits for many whites

does not mean that these bene- . - I

fits outweigh the costs ‘of ra-
cism. In the first place, such bene-
fits are wholly illegitimate,
since they spring from an unjust
subordination of others. Second,
creation of these benefits imposes
immense costs upon millions of
nonwhite Americans. Finally. by
preventing nonwhites from de-

veloping their maximum produc- ’

tive potential, racism also in-
hibits them from creating much

greater economic. social, and cul-» ' - ~

 

tural wealth than they /do now. A 

This" makes _all of society poor-A
er than it would be without ra-
cism——including th
who benefit from r cist behavior
and institutions.
. CONCLUSION

Americans seeking to combat
racism should understand three
additional points. First, racism in

' this country is the product of -

more than 300 years of system-
atic subordination of Indians and
Negroes by the white majority,
plus later subordination of still
other groups. The racist attitudes,
behavior patterns, institutional
structures, and cultural heritage
built up over these three centur-

 

very, people i 

 

 

ies are.profoundly embedded in j 

our society. They cannot be erad-
icated overnight, or in just a few ,

years. Therefore, effectively com-» ~ 

bating racism will require con-

tinouous and prolonged persist-  

ence by both whites and Negroes.
They must be deeply committed-
indeed. dedicated-—to this goal.

However, there are signs that - 

many white Americans are al-

ready tired of hearing about "the  

race question.” Because most‘

whites conceive of racism}only'; _
in the overt forms, they be‘_l'ieve 
it is rapidly disappearing orfhas 

already diminished to an insig-

nificant level. For example, in 1,966,-
70 percent of the national-sample , _

of whites intereviewed by-«the
Louis Harris organization thought
the Negroes were moving’ too
fast toward integration.

 

4,

i

 

This leads to the second point:  3:

the principal task of those white

Americans combating racism lies‘ 

within the white community,
rather than within nonwhite com-

munities. As pointed out earlier,. ;
no policies or programs aimed at

    Analysis of   Racism

(Continued from Page 5)

improving conditions in black
America or among Mexican Amer-
icans or other minorities can pos-
sibly succeed unless they are po-
litically supported by a majority
of whites. Such support is essen-
tial to obtain the money and in-
stitutional changes required to
alter those conditions. Yet that
support will not be forthcoming
unless most whites significantly
revise their present views con-
cerning racism. Many whites,
especially those living in suburbs,
are almost completely isolated
from anydirect contacts with life
in Negro ghettos, or Puerto Rican
neighborhoods or other minority
group areas. Hence, they fail to
perceive the compelling need

 

 

for further remedial actions there.
Moreover, they do not understand
how institutional subordination
works. Therefore, these whites

-think the plight of ghetto dwellers

is largely their own fault, rather
than largely the productiof racism
expressed by institutions control-
led by whites.

Only two forces can change
this dominant view. The first con-
sists of the dedicated efforts of
well informed white leaders with-
in white communities who un-

. derstand all forms of racism, and

why much more must be done to
eradicate them. The second is
development of greater capabil-
ities and powerwithin the Ne-
g_ro community and other non-
white communities. By its very
nature. this development must

Project Appalachia
Aids Kentucky Poor

By VERONICA MAZZITTI

To aid the people of Knox
County. Kentucky in meeting
their needs. a bazaar was held in
the Student Union on November
20 and 21 under the co-ordina-
tion ofthe Pitt YMCA.

‘All of the over 150 different
items featured were hand-crafted
by the people of’ Knox County.

aThey included jewelry, wooden

stools, ceramic pieces, candles,
knitted vests, and mountain toys.

Knox County, a rural district
of Southeast Kentucky. remains
beset with severe social and eco-

 

County. ""Project Appalachia”
is directed at enabling the peo-
ple of Knox County to become
self-supporting,” said Reverend
John Wersing, director of the
project%“Though some of the it-
ems are not of the finest quality
(ceramics), they are what the peo-
ple have to offer.”

"Kentucky Krafts Store," of
the North Hills, supplied the it-
ems for the bazaar. It sells mer-
chandise solely from Knox Coun-
ty on a non-profit basis. thereby
providing an outlet for the hand-
crafted goods. ,
expensive items found

occur primarily through the ef-
forts of nonwhite Americans them-
selves. Once such development
begins. it will better demonstrate
the true potentialities and abilities
of those Americans, and give their
leaders a stronger bargaining
position from which to influence
public and private policies.
These changes may in turn per-
suade the white majority to de-
vote more resources to the task
of still further developing iion—
white capabilities. both in non-
white communities and through-
outsociety. ‘

Thus. the process of overcom-

. ing racism involves a continuous
feedback between changing the

views of — the white majority and
expanding the capabilities and
power of nonwhite communities.
It is clear that the most critical
role in this process for whites
fighting racism "is influencing
the opinions of other whites. Sim-
ilarly. the most critical role for
nonwhites is developing their
own communities.

This conclusion certainly does
not imply that no_whites should
work in nonwhite areas, or vice
versa._ Intact," such joint action is
important for combating racism.
But the predominant efforts of
whites in this combat should never-
theless involve those strategies

focused upon the white commun-‘

ity itself. For no one else can

carry out those strategies—yet with-

out them, the entire struggle is
doomed. ‘

Opposing racism is indeed a
worthy objective for all Ameri-
cans. It is the highest tradition

. ‘Call You Sweetheart”

By BARB GERAUD

Well. if you’ve been waiting
with bated breath for a brand-
spanking new Neil 1, Young al-
bum, keep holding it——this ain't
it. But if you dig nostalgia. the
Buffalo Springfield. Crosby
Stills Nash & Young, the Beach

(Boys, the Stray Gators or the

Tony and Susan Alamo Christian
Foundation Orchestra and Chor-
us. you'll love his Journey through
the Past. (Reprise 2XS 6480)

This‘ double album set is the
original soundtrack recording of
his film of the same title—Neil‘s
autobiography, which he‘s been
working on for some time and
is due to be released this month.

And it’s really a strange al-
bum. Side Oneistarts out with a
"For What It’s Worth/Mr. Soul"
medley, which sounds as if it
were recorded off the Buffalo's
performance on Hollywood Pal-
ace back‘ in ’68, complete with
screams from the obviously parti-
san audience. -

Side Two is Neil with the
Stray Gators—“Are You Ready for
the Country” and “Alabama”.
There’s also a group of uniden-
tified females singing “Let Me
In a ra-
ther off-key fashion, along with

   

 

a fantastic version of “Southern
Man”—which I can’t tell if it's
CSN&Y or Neil and some back-up
group.

Side Three is a short version
of “Words“ (off the Harvest al-
bum) plus a long session-type
recording, complete with mis-
cues. missed harmonies. Neil
banging piano. and a sho1‘t
glimpse into all the work that
must go into making one of his
recordings so perfect.

But it’s Side Four thats really
weird. The first three songs are
by the Tony & Susan. Alamo
Christian Foundation Orchestra
and Chorus—“Relativity Invita-
tion,’»’. Handel‘s "Messiah” (the
invitatory) and “The ‘King of
Kings’ Theme,” all done in an
excellent, albeit amateur fashion.

(I should explain about Tony
& Susan Alamo. They are the
original Los Angeles Jesus freaks.
They’re "organized and incorpor-

I ated, and quite persistent in their

desire to ‘fspread the wot: .”
They also tend to go a bit over-
board in trying to persuade those
'not of their convictions, to change.
But they are sincere.) '
So either Neil is recording

some facet of life in Hollywood
(their stronghold) or he's been

  Neil's ‘Journey.’ Sentimental    

"saved." Whatever it is. the mu-
sic is good. ’

Those selections segue into
Neil‘s only original composition
on this album. a thing entitled
"Soldier.“ And as many times
as I played this. I can‘t make
out more than a quarter of the
words. and they give no clue to
the song’s meaning. It‘s a bit
over-produced. and Neil’s voice
is drowned out by his orchestra-
tions.

The last -track is “Let's Go
Away for Awhile." written by
Brian Wilson and listed as being
performed by the Beach Boys.
However, it's very difficult to’

._make out any voices on it—it

sounds more‘ like Brian started
playing around with a Moog he
had programmed voices into . . .
But it's beautiful.’ though word-
less. - ~ ‘I

All in all. I can't quite figure
out how to describe this album.
or even to say if I‘d recommend
it to anyone other than those who
think Neil Young is the greatest
thing since rock music. But for
being\Neil‘s own view of his life.
and for the music it contains—
the live recordings of both Neil
andgthe Buffalo—it’s one helluva

' collection of great music.

A Aquatic Delicacies :

  ..On Poli's Bill of Fare!

By ANDREW J. SOPKO

“If it swims. we have it." Cer-
tainly a large claim for any sea-
food -restaurant. especially one
far from the -coast. but Poli‘s in
Squirrel Hill /comes rather

close in fulfilling its favorite ax- 

iom. And while there are no
mermaids on the premises. a var-
ied number of aquatic delicacies
are available for the discerning
gourmand. —

Even though other seafood res-

taurants in our are__a have some-
tim_es stolen the culinary lime-

light from Poli’s (especially one ’

downtown establishment located

in our city’s “financial district.“ ). .

this seafood house offers a ‘list

of fruits de ‘mer which. although

not encyclopedic. gives the¢din-
er a fairlyinteresting selection. *

‘Perhaps the most relished and
most expensive ritual at Poli’s is
the selection of a lobster as one’s
entree. The ritual of the trip to
the lobster tank 'has very often
been frowned upon' by purists
but it nevertheless provides an

. . unusual experience for the en-

-£-

i,.~

A Orr ANY?» PURCHASE

thusiast.

At the tank". the patron choos-
es his “victim" and pays propor-
tionately for its weight (lobster
at this Squirrel Hill landmark is
v_ery dear and hovers near $4.00
a pound). As the lobster is plac-
ed upon the scale above the
tank. both the waitress and the
diner find themselves calculating
in their heads just how much
the delicacy is-_ going to cost.
Without further ado. the animal
is ‘then carried away to meet its

-fate and the diner returns to his

table. , v-.- . l5... ,5

A recent trip to Poli's reveal-
ed a number of fine homardic
specimens in their tank. My din-
ing companion feasted upon a
magnificent three and a quarter
pound lobster which proved it-

 

self equal in flavor to its enor-
mity. The meat of the claws was
especially flavorful and there
was plenty of it.- certainly not
the case-~as far as most lobster
claws are concerned.

‘ My own selection, the familiar
seafoodplatter-, was heaped with
varieties of shrimps, mussels,
fish and other delicacies. It is
such a complete entree that one
usually has not the'room to fin-
ish it or at least does not dare
to do so if he wish to have room
for dessert.

Appetizers at Poli's merit a
round of applause. Besides the
usual list of juices and fruitcups.
there are several honorable men-
tions: she crab soup-a tasty con-
coction but rather lacking in
crab meat. oysters au nature!-
no squabble about preparation
here. and most exotic of all. a
dish combining mussels. wine.
and butter.

The end of the meal carries
with it an acceptable list of
sweets. A. creme de menthe par-
fait or a crunchy slice of pecan

=-pie or probably one’s best bets

3 I

in this regard. ‘

Service at Po1i‘s is Aunrushed
and the entire atmosphere is in-
formal and relaxed. As a family
restaurant. Poli's is unostenta—
tious. Lobster bibs and other such
table traditions add color to the
dining room scene.

While this establishment fol-
lows less, of a formal regimen
than many other restaurants. the
price for dinner for two can top
the twenty dollar mark. The qual-
ity of'the restaurant's lobsters
and other produce. which are
flown in daily. -is c?ertain'ly“'_a
primary reason for what many
budget minded students may con-
sider an unfortunately prohibi-
tive tariff. '

A good hours

By BARBARA GERAUD

Friday. November 24 started
out as a nice evening. I'd gone
home after work to watch Star
Trek, had a nice left-over-turkey
dinner. and was moseying back
into town for the Grand Funk
concert. We had front row seats
and were looking forward to a
laughing watching
Mark Farner prance over the
stage. ‘

But before the evening was
half over. we were both to wish
it had never even started.

Billy Preston put on a medio-
cre set — he only did four songs-
"Satisfaction." "I Wrote a Sim‘-
ple Song." "Outa-Space." and
"That's the ‘Way God Planned
It." It was obvious neither he
nor the audience had any affec-
tion for the other. . . . .

.-The aisles didn’t fill up with
milling people the way they
normally do during intermission,
and my girlfriend and I had
hopes that people would behave
themselves and not trample one
another to death trying to get
to the stage. '

I was in the middle of chang-
ing the roll of film in my cam-
era when I was suddenly push-
ed. shoved and trampled by
what seemed to be hundreds of
bodies, ‘gravitating like lem-
mingstowards the area in front
ofthe stage. heedless of any-
thing and anybody i‘fi"thei'r path. "

We were surrounded,
more bodies pushing their way
in -by the second. Needless to

say, we couldn’t see the stage,"

there was no room in front of
our seats for -us to stand, and my
camera was in danger of immedi-
ate annihilation by various hands
trying to hold on to anything for

support. (Me, I didn’t care about

—Blue..Cross would» pay for any
damages to ‘my priceless. person.

sured (premiums too high) and

Deciding ’twas better to leave

 ria Sabina, an oratorio by Camilo Jose_Cela with music composed and

 terpreted the part in its Carnegie Hall premiere in New York on April
 1. 17.’1970. and subsequently in Madrid. The music will be performed
 '2 bythe Carnegie-Mellon College/Community Orchestra accompanied
by the Carnegie-Mellon Chorus under the direction of Donald Wilkins.

I Camilo Jose Cela, the author of «Maria Sabina, is one of Spain’s
___most prominent novelists as well as beinga member of the Royal Span-
V ish Academy and the Hispanic Society of America‘. Celais oratorio. like
' “the, Honegger-Claudel Joan of Arc at the Stake, dramatizes the trial of
a woman accused of witchcraft and sentenced to death. Based on an ac-
‘ tual incident in contemporary Mexico. the oratorio both exceeds and
l universalizes the mere facts of an otherwise commonplace village
incident.

I Leonardo Balada. pr,eJsently an associate professor of music com-
position at Carnegie—Me’llon University. is a graduate of the Barcelona
Conservatorio and the Julliard School of New York. Inaddition to the
music-for Maria- Sabina, his works include Guernica, Sinfonia en Ne-
E: fgro, Guitar Concerto, and Cumbres.

. , Maria Sabina has already been performed in New York, Madrid,
San Francisco ‘and Louisville, with Balada conducting the New York
and Madrid premieres, and a recording will be made of the piece by the
Louisville Symphony Orchestra in 1973. ‘

3 Tickets for this performance are $4. $3. and $2 and are available
at Kaiifmanns. Gimbels-. Horne‘s. downtown. and at the Student Unions
‘of the University and Duquesne University aswell as the Forum Of-

draw the order. but he declined, to
do so in writing. In return, the
company promised that nothing
would be printed about the with-
drawal in the Journal.

The first indication that Anthony
might have decided to abandon
the agreement came in an edition
of the weekly Union City Times-
Leader two weeks afterward. Un-
ion City is between Erie and Cor-
ry. -

Based on a half-hour interview
with Anthony. the Times-Leader
reported that the order apparent-
ly hadonly been "softened”~not
withdrawn.

The judge was quoted as ac-
knowledging that he had met with
representatives of Bradford Pub-
lications and that together they
did reach an agreement.

But as portrayed by the judge,
the agreem’ent’s terms were

 

 

vague. Anthony said specifically
only that the Journal had prom-
ised not to print any information
about juvenile court proceedings
without clearing the story with
him first.

In his response as relayed by
his secretary. the judge denied
that any agreement existed at all.

Then. following a recent hear-
ing involving a Corry youth. the
judge referred to the order from
the bench.

Three Corry police officers as
well as a state trooper from Cor-
ry were present. .

“For the benefit of you Corry
officers." Anthony said. “I re-
mind you that.there is a court or-
der which prohibits your giving
any information about juvenile
proceedings to the Corry paper.“

That statement was made‘ Nov.
16. The meeting at which Anthony
promised to withdraw the order
was held Oct. 18——a month earlier.

 

Mi... 3.... New. Real.  

Spokesmen for both the Journal
and Bradford ' Publications have
declined to comment on the situa-
tion, but a source close to them
noted that this was in keeping
with their position under the
agreement.

I The source said Bradford Pub— -

lications had decided to seek the
agreement, rather than challenge
Anthony's order through higher
court appeals in good faith and
in the interests of community har-

mony.

Phi Kappa Theta Holds

50th Anniversary Gala

By MARK RINOVATA

Everyone is tamiliar with class reunions; visiting old haunts.
reliving the past with each familiar face. Looking back on the good
times always calls for a celebration. But how does it feel to visit
a part of. the past after an abscence of ten. twenty. even thirty
years‘? How would the changes which occurred in that time affect
someone who had been away so long‘?

These were among the questions asked of the Phi Kappa 'l‘heta
alumni who were on hand for their fraternity‘s 50th anniversary
dinner-dance. The response was unanimous and usually went some-
thing like this: '‘I haven‘t had so much fun in years." or "Reminds
me of the old college days. You know. that was a hell of a long
time ago."

The event, held on November 18, filled the Eric‘ Ballroom of
the Quality Court Motel on Route 19. One hundred and sixty-four

"people, including twenty-four Alumni couples, came from .various

parts of the’ city and country to celebrate Phi Kappa Theta’s 60
year existence as a national fraternity at Pitt. The contrast of the
graduating classes was apparent but didn’t seem to dampen the
enthusiasm of the party. While most of the Alumni in attendance
were recent graduates, several men received Pitt diplomas as far
back as 1949 and quite a few of the alumns were among the gradu-
ates between the years of 1950 to 1958.

Mr. Lou Mclinden, former fraternity advisor. and Dan Melero,
Mr. Mclindens successor, also attended the anniversay celebra-
tion as honored guests. They were seated at the speakers table along
with Tom Agresti. Phi Kappa Theta President. Joe Tarquinia. the
fraternities national representative.- Ed Sobibile. national treasurer.
and Keith Clelland and Jeff Weber. the organizers of the event.

The fraternity received several plagues commemorating its
anniversary. These included presentations by Ed Sobibile. the na-
tional treasurer, Howard Affinito, representative of Falstaff distrib-
utors who supply the beer for the house. and Roger Cerini. the
pledge class president. The main presentation was a plaque given
to Mr. Lou Mclinden by Phi Kappa Theta in honor of his great
efforts for the house and the fraternity systemat Pitt during his
six years as Pitts fraternity advisor.

Unofficial Panel Blames Police
for Southern U. Deaths

By CHARLES LAYTON
Associated Press Writer

BATON ROUGE. La. AP —
College administrators, police and
state officials were entirely to
blame for the Nov. 16 shooting
deaths of two black students at
Southern University. an unofficial
panel of black investigators said
in a preliminary report on Wed-
nesday.

D'army Bailey. a Berkeley.
Calif. city councilman and co-
chairman of the panel, said _com-
mittee members reached the con-
clusion that the students were
killed by shotgun-wielding sher-
iff's deputies- and unanimously
agreed there was "more than
adequate reason for criminal pro-
secution of those responsible for
the deaths."

The committee’s conclusions

were read at a news conference

by Bailey and did not cite spe-

cific testimony of witnesses in-
terviewed. Bailey said a detail-
ed report would be issued in
two weeks.

The black panel’s findings
drew immediate criticism from
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards
who termed it “as much black-
wash as they accuse the state
of a whitewash." .

"It was my feeling that very
few of the members of the pan-
el had come to Louisiana with an
open mind," said Edwards, who
appeared before the black group
Monday to answer their some-
times hostile questions.

An official iinivestigating com-
mittee appointed by Edwards
and headed by state Atty. Gen.
William Guste is looking into

how and why students Denver
A. Smith, 20, of New Roads,
La., and Leonard Douglas Brown,
20, of Gilbert, La. died.

The unofficial committee was
formed by blacks who said they
didn’t trust any official inquiry.

The
tee was in recess Wednesday.
with hearings scheduled to re-
sume Thursday. ~ '

The students died of bucksliot
wounds to the head during the
police-student confrontation on‘
the steps of the Southern ad-
ministration building. Law en-
forcement officials have said no
live ammunition was fired by
the officers. only tear gas car-
tridges. But Bailey said his

committee was sure the depu-. -'

ties had fired buckshot.

cal that played a year Off-Broad-
way. will be staged for the first

row Is The First Day Of The
Rest Of My Life.”

The rock musical will be dir-
ected by Tom Thomas and will

ers and a five piece rock combo.

Thomas has acted in and dir-
ected many Playtiouse main-
stage productions including The
Odd Couple, Little Foxes, Irma
La Douce, The King and I, and

and Dracula in the Theatre Up-
stairs.

iences. Thomas directed the Civ-

 Tomorrow afternoon. coach Dave Adams’ wrestling forces open

or, Michigan. '

Rick'gBay's Wolverines are co-favorites for the Big Ten wrestling
tie and will give the Cat grapplers a tough test right off the bat.

The Wolverines bested the Panthers last year 25-17, in a match

 ‘Which was decided by a few crucial matches. Because there will

_ John ‘Bimbo’ Chatman, who will be looked on to provide a lot

in need of new blood and Jim
Bolla and Kirk Bruce were tem-
porarily introduced to the lineup.

The clock only showed the pas-
sage of 11 minutes and already
the Cats had collected. 10 turn-
overs and Mount Union nine. By
the end of the first half both
squads had accumulated 14
turnovers a piece.

While the Pitt hoopsters con-
tinued to hand over the ball they
were unable to break the Purple
Raiders‘ zone defense to any
great extent. Although the Mount
Union players were a smaller
squad. Pitt had trouble working
in on them for the inside shot and
could only struggle to a 18-18
tie with eight minutes left in the
half.

Pitt‘s head basketball coach
Buzz Ridl expected Mount Un-
ion to be tough but he was un-
prepared for the trouble the Raid-
ers gave the Cats. He felt, how-
ever, that it was probably due to
the fact that it was the first
game.

"I had mentioned to a lot of
people that Mount Union was
good," related Ridl. "But they
didn’t believe me."

“I was hoping to do better
against them but I‘m not sur-
prised we had a tough time in
the first ballgame." '

 DePasqua, Big Four By The Boards

CorIGefs Boot
After HO Cord

By VINCE Di NARDO

Speaking from his office in the Pitt Field House. Pitt Athletic
Director Casimir Myslinski fired head football coach Carl De Pas-

qua last Monday afternoon.

4 Speaking in a solemn mood. Myslinski finally ended the specula-
tion that had been alive,since midway through the recent season.

“This morning. I relieved Carl De Pasqua of his responsibilities as head foot-

seemed like the Cats might pull
out of the game with some dis-
tance between themselves and
their opponents.

With only 4241 left to play the
Cats managed to get 12 points
up on the Raiders. leading 71-59.
But this lead. which was one
of their largest throughout the
contest. was quickly drained.-

Mount Union’s Barry Ring and
Harold Young knawed away at
the Cat lead. scoring four points
each out of the total 10 for the
Raiders in the last minutes.

The tight Raider defense held
the inconsistent Pitt shooters to
only four points and forced the
Panthers to freeze the ball to‘
maintain their slim lead over
them.

One of the brighter spots in,
the ‘game for the Panthers was

  

ball coach at the University of Pittsburgh. It was a difficult decision to reach
and one that was done after much thought and evaluation.”

Along with De Pasqua, Myslinski also dismissed the whole assistant staff.

After taking the job in ‘69 DePasqua guided Pitt to 13-29 mark before dismissal. He
had his team 5-1 one point in ‘70. riding high and ranked top in the East.

But. with only four victories in the last two years, Myslinski sought change.

“I’m not saying Carl was a bad coach,” explained the AD, “I’m saying Carl
was a good coach. He just didn’t fit into the pattern that we had to work with. We
just had the wrong man for the situation.”

Myslinski pointed to “the lack of experience in the juniors and seniors" as
determining factors to De Pasqua’s fate.

“I have to look at the sutiation from the standpoint of crowds at the games. ‘I
don’t think we could have expected too many people in the stands after a 1-10 sea-
son. I think Carl would have had a hard time recruiting." Myslinski said.

“In the next few days,” he continued. “I willcontact several prospective coach-
es that we are interested in. I‘m not saying I‘m going to get a man who‘s going to
work miracles, I'm trying to get a coach who is going to make an impact in the

‘‘I‘m looking for somebody with a lot of impact, somebody who can getius
straight to the top."

Unaffected by. the change will be Serafino Fazio, who was moved up to, head
recruiter last Spring.

All the dismissed assistants will be recommended for an interview by .\lyslinski
when the new mentor is located.

“Because of the recruiting needs. I hope to have a new head football coach within
two or three weeks." the AD announced.

the performance of Bill ‘Moon-
ey' Knight. Knight needled the
Raider defense for a total of 28
points. completing 14 out of 23

field goal attempts. Martin fol-'

lowed Knight with a 151 point to-
tal. V .

Ridl‘s appraisal of Knight's
performance was. “Knight pull-

- ed us out of the game offensive-

ly." -

Ed Lawrence was the high
scorer for the Mount Union
squad collecting 22 points: Law-
rence was also one of the top

rebounders with 10 rebounds.

*' * *

The Pitt_ hoopsters next con-
test will be with the North Car-
olina Tar Heels tomorrow at
2:00 p.m. WTAE radio will cov-
er the game f'or the cagers.

The Tar Heels will prove much
tougher competitors for the Pan-
thers. Last season the North
Carolina squad battled its way
to the NCAA‘championships only
to lose in the quarter finals.

Lost to the Tar Heels ranks are
Robert McAdoo, Dennis Wu_ycik.
Bill Chamberlain and Steve Pre-
vis. All of these players played
key roles in the many victories
in NC's past seasons.

The squad will lean heavily-on
the talents of veterans Bobby
Jones and George Karl to help
rebuild the team and also to
help them retain its traditionally
winning ways.

Jones. 6-9. led the Atlantic
Coast Conference (ACC) in field
goal shooting (66.8) last year
and averaged 10.2 points. Sur-
prisingly enough he was also sel-
ected to the United States Olym-
pic team. '

Karl. NC‘s other top veteran.

might also include Ray Hite or
sophomore Ray.H~ ' '

  
   

Wolverines C

  First Foe

John Buzzato, who was pinned
by Jerry Hubbard last year, will
face him once again. Hubbard
racked up an 18-3 record last
year, enroute to the Big Ten cham-
pionship and8 losing to Wade
Schalles in the NCAA champion-
ship match in that weight class.

Wally Morrell (167), Jim Car-
ramanna or Lamar Hudson at
(177). Craig Trich (190), and
George Calagnini (heavyweight)
will round out the starting lineup.

Adams admitted that his Cats
will either win or lose the match.
There will be no moral victory for
his team if they manage to hold
the Wolverines close.

“There is no such thing as a
moral victory,” he stated. “You
either win or lose. We‘d have.to

be considered the underdogs
however.”

Adams remembers his days as
a wrestler.—days when an athlete
had to wait til his junior year to
get a shot at a starting job. But
is because he is relying heavily on
underclassmen, he feels they can
do the job.

“These guys are stepping
right in and I think they can do
thejob.

“You’ve got to expect the
young kids to make mistakes.”
Adams admitted. "So early in the
season; the mistakes are almost
going to be inevitable.

Cats Lose Out

STATE COLLEGE. Pa. — John
Hufnagel and John Hogan both
went beserk in their last games as
collegiate quarterbacks last Sat-
urday. Hufnagel. with a better
supporting cast helptedthe Penn.
State Nittany Lions to a relative-
ly easy win over the Pitt Pan-
thers. by the score of 49-27.

Hufnagel passed for over 300
yards and tossed three touchdown
passes. all in the first three quar-
ters. "Huffy." as he is’ called.
took the fourth quarter off and
John Hogan took up the slack by
passing for 189 _yards and four
scoring strikes.

.

sive lineman by Gridiron Maga-
zine. Hyde was selected along
with two other notables — Joe
Ehrmann of Syracuse and Mike
Bannon of Penn State.

Still another Panther gridder to
be honored was defensive end Jim
Buckmon. He was named ECAC
Lineman of the Week against
West Virginia.

Shuttle busses for all home bas-
ketball games at Pitt will be pro-
vided for the students‘ conven-
ience. The buses will leave from
Bigelow Blvd. at 7 p.m. and will
return one-half hour after the
game.

Hufnagel passed for his 26th
career touchdown and 13th this
season. Hogan's tosses set a all-
time Pitt record with his 14 TD
passes thisseason. The old rec-
ord was set by Jim Friedl in. 1969
(12). Hogan also set the Pitt rec-
ord for most scoring passes in one
contest.

The Nittany Lions operated as
if they were on a picnic in the
second and third quarters af-
ter a Pitt fumble on their 20 yard
line set up the second Penn State
touchdown in 46 seconds. The

Cats had held them scoreless in

the first quarter.

Bill Daniels started the game
for the Panthers but didn‘t fare
too well. He had extreme diffi-
cultv moving the ball against a
very cohesive Lion defense.

The Panthers had trouble run-
ning the ball all day and only man-
aged a total of 19 yards in 31 car-
ries.

Mike Cappaletti, who rushed
for more than 1,000 yards fog, the
Lions this year, managed to ‘cop
77 yards.

The»Nittanv Lions finished the_

season 10-1 with the win over Pitt
while the Cats accumulated an
opposite 1-10 mark.

The Lions have an engagement
in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's
Day against one of the nations
top teams. They will face Okla-
homa.

.—P'.';!l.ge' 14#—TIlIS PITT NEWS—Friday, December 1, 1972

The Pitt squad knew what the
Dukes. and particularly C. H.
Bender. did to St. Francis and
were determined not to let the
game get out of hand. To say the
least, the St. Francis team is not
at a level of parity with the rest
of the WPIHA and the game re-
flected it. .

With only two-thirds of the first
period gone. Pitt coaches Tom
Meyers and Guy Carole turned to
the bench and ordered the team
not to score anymore. Pitt already
had a 10-0 lead. That’s a difficult
thing for a hockey player to do and
at times it seemed so obvious that
missing the net on purpose would
be more embarrassing to St.
Francis than adding another goal.

Pitt did relax and keep control
of the game, using it more as a
practice session with particular
emphasis on passing and ragging
the puck. The skaters didn’t get a
workout on the defense, however,
as St. Francis did "not get a shot on
goal. In fact, not one Frankie even
took a shot at all.

Meyers and Carole sent out the
third and second linesfor most of
the game, giving the “lush line" a‘
rest. Even with the intentions of
keeping the score to a minimum. «

In fact. each of the metropolitan

i” Win Over MI. Union

By RON SIEGEL
Pitts junior varsity basketball
team got off to a much more im-
pressive start than the varsity did
Wednesday night. as it rolled
over the Mt. Union jayvees.
90-60. g '
Seven players dressed for the

Cubs. and all were freshmen. as‘

had been expected. None of the
frosh dressed for the varsity
game. a

Coaching the junior varsity
Mike Paul. Grgurich is also
coaching the varsity, while Paul.
who pla_yed for Pitt last season.
will concentrate exclusively on
thejayvees.

The game started out as a
tight game, and Pitt trailed late
in the half, 28-27. Finally» Mt.
Union’s hot outside shooting cool-
ed off, and the Cubs picked it
up. With guards Keith Starr and
Tom Richards doing most of the
scoring, Pitt built up a 45-34

Aead by halftime, and the out-

-come was never in doubt from

Richards and Starr lead Pitt
in scoring, Starr hitting for 21
points, while Richards added 20.
Leading» scorer of the game hon-
ors went to Bill Boyer of Mount
Union. who finished the night
with 26 points. if

The entire Pitt team was im-
pressive. and all seven frosh that
dressed saw plenty of action.

up with 18 points.

Mark Disco got hot in the sec-

added eight points, and_ Bobby
Shrewsbury netted six. ‘

Richards and Starr were the
stars of the game though. as

,Richards was constantly stealing

the ball. while Starr seemed to
captain the team. and was do-
ing everything well.

It was Paul‘s coaching debut.
and he found it different from

Bob Steele competed in the
NCAA Cross Country meet in
Houston. Texas last Monday.

Out of a field of 297 of the
top long distance runners in the
country Steele came in 124th
with a time of 30.18.

"He did very well." commented
Head Coach Jim Banner who
also made the trip to Houston.

"The team played real well
though. they hustled and work-
ed hard." he noted. "The first
half was a little sloppy. but they

came around in the second." “He’s come a long way and

Swimmers   Open I In

  Penn State Relays

By: YAIER LEHRER

A This‘Saturday the Pitt Swimming team will compete in the
Fourth Annual Penn State Relays. This is one of four championship
meets the team will compete in this year. The meet consists of nine
swimming events and two diving relays against seventeen other
teams who will be in the meet. ‘

It is very hard to pick one outstanding swimmer for the relays
because a relay race is the calmination of the efforts of four swim-
mers and focusing on the one would be taking away from the others.

The divers ..have already won the Clarion Invitational Tourna-
ment and it appears that they have a great future ahead of them
with only one junior on the team and four freshmen who should be
around for a while.

The team overall is very young with no seniors, three juniors and,

twenty-four freshmen. With so many freshmen, one can’t predict the

‘ stars of this year's team, but there are some hopes riding on four re-

turning Iettermen. They include James Howell and Jerry O’Leary,
both free-style distance swimmers, Ed Cahill in the backstroke and
free-style, and Martin Staley, a diver. '

Last year’s team won four meets and lost six but a better season
is expected and swimming coach Richard Bradshaw and diving
coach Al Coffey hope to finish in the top five in the Eastern Colle-
giate Athletic Conference.

The first home meet will be on Saturday. December 9.

has a great future ahead of
him,” he continued.

Conditions for the meet could
not have been worse. The course
was wet and the mud was very
deep.

Steele did excellent in the
first three miles. then -dropped
back in the fourth and fifth. and
came back again in the sixth.

There was a big rush at the»

finish what times being very
close together 48th place had a
time of 29.48 where Steele who
placed 124 the had a time of
30.18.

"It's the fastest race I‘ve ever
run." commented Steele.

Dan Cussick of East Tennessee
State came in first with a time
of 28.43. As far as team compe-
tion went, the University of Ten-
nessee came in first with 135
pts., Washington State University
came in second and East Tennes-
see came in third.

Steele Finishes In Top
Half At NCAA Meet

While Steele was disappoint-
ed with his perfprmance. he was
competing against the best in
the country. A 1971 graduate of
Beaver Falls High School Steele
only started running cross coun-
try and track in his senior year

‘ of high school. V »

Steele had always played base-
ball. Playing baseball for eight
years Steele had no interest in
running. .While playing

in shape for baseball the track
coach singled him out and from

then on Steele was running track '

-and cross country.

is indeed an honor that he
was named to the All East Cross
Country Team. Next year's cross
country season should prove‘ to

. be interesting for Bob Steele.
