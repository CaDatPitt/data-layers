IF Gives Okay

  For «All College

Get-Togetliers

The plan for weekly open-house
affairs at campus fraternity houses
Friday afternoons was oﬂicially
adopted by Inter-Fraternity Coun-
cil. The program, originated here
by Phi Epsilon Pi and introduced
to IF members by vice-president
Don Gartner, has quickly caught
on. —
IF decided toiundertake the

projectduring their meeting last

Wednesday evening at the Phi

Delta Theta house.
_ Bob Barrickman, Col. ’57, was
appointed chairman of the Open-
house project by President John
King and took over responsibilities
of the “Friday at Four" affair.

The initial plan was increased in
scope by Sigma Alpha Epsilon
which has hosted open-houses the
past two weeks and has opened

' them to guests from other local

colleges.

“Pitt, Tech, PCW. Mt. Mercy,
and Duquesne are so close in
miles. but are so far away when
it comes to knowing the students
individually and doing things to-
gether,“ Barrickman said.

“The Open House affords a
chance for students from the dif-
ferent schools to become better
acquainted with each other.” he
added, and thus become a factor in
eliminating the impersonal feel-
ing."

Experimental Education Study
Initiates Pilot Philosophy Class

A pilot course for! an experimental study ofliberal arts
for adults was initiated this week at the University of Pitts-
burgh. This course, philosophy, will be used as the basis

for the trial project.

Twenty—eight students have been hand picked from the
more than 500 adults who have participated in. the program

of non-credit adult education courses.

The class will meet

every other Thursday evening at 8:15 in the Cathedral of
Learning for 14 sessions which will last until May'24. Dr.
John W. McCarthey, professor of philosophy, will work with
_these students to develop an acceptable program, of study.

Viers W. Adams, director of the
Pitt extension Division, stated
that these class members repre- '
sent a cross section of adults in-
terested in such a course. From
the ages of Zlpto 71, students in-
clude college graduates and non-
college graduates, professional
men and house wives.

-Last summer. these people held
a conference to determine the
aims of the course. They discussed
not only the content of the pro-
posed course but also the most
effective method of presentation.

The conference and resulting

course was started by a Uni-’

versity committee and the Cen-
ter for Study of Liberal Educa-
tion for Adults in Chicago.
Carroll Reynolds, associate di-
rector of the Extension Division;
Arthur Young, professor of clas-
sics and head of the department;
Francis Pray, public relations
counselor; Putnam Jones, associ-
ate dean of the College; and T.,F.

tee. “

of seating arrangements which
had proven a hindrance for Coach
Carl Olson’s track team. After
each game, it was necessary for
stadium workers to pull extending
band bleachers off the'track. an
expensive job that required labor
needed for other work.

Students Too Noisy

Asked what should be done so’

that students could hear the band
so far away, Arthur responded,
“They’re too noisy.” He pointed
out that at Mt. Lebanon and other
high school stadium crowds quiet-
ed down when the band started to
play. T . . .
The band director appeared
mildly surprised that the move
had caused such a furor al-
though he had received mail
protesting the position. “I’d just
as soon move back,”, he conced-
ed, “although it would change a
lot of things forus.”

No changes could now be made.

for the Miami game, however;
plans have already been set up
for band formations.
Wants Band" Back

Graduate Manager Frank Car-
ver fully aware of the fan attitudes
because he has" received “anon-
ymous” letters, stated emphatically
“I’d like to‘ have the band back
with the -students.” But because of
limited ﬁnances due to poor crowds
this season, it. would be difficult to
make the changes required.

He offered the idea for next
season that the first 15 rows in _
the present student section could
be torn out and special seating

installed for band 'mcmbers.
Carver didn’t seem to think the
cost would be prohibitive.

Arthur suggested earlier Wed-
nesday that possibly the student
section could be moved to the
other side of the 50-yard line

, where opposing cheering sections

are now stationed, to be closed to
the band. Although less expensive
than installing new seats, the idea

could not be carried out this sea-.

son, Carver reminded,‘ because
advanced ticket sales.

Jim Nycum, ’55, a Varsity band
line leader, queried by telephone
as to»his opinion of the change,
stated, “It’s been a toss-up. Where
we were sitting, everything was
behind us.” Referring to Arthur,
the Tenor Saxaphone player re-
plied, “He should know best where
the band should be.”

Watched Holes Open

Nycum, who sits in one of the
top rows stated that although
they could nottell where the team
was playing on the ﬁeld, the band
was able to watch line plays and
“holes open.”

Trumpet player Arny Landy,

of

Col. ’58, strongly differed from"

Nycum’s viewpoint. “Most of the
band members I've spoken to don’t
like the change. We’re too far
away,” he answered.

Band publicity chairman Boyd
Swarts favored solutions offer-
ed by Arthur and Carver be-
cause, “Band members deﬁnitely
want to be near the students for
enthusiasm.”

N I Rel 'gious Outlook
1 Ever since Chaplain Emory Luccock arrived on campus
some four years ago, religious emphasis here has steadily
increased. Individual organizations have offered members
of their faiths widespread facilities and opportunities which
are vital in the educative processes this University conducts.
Tuesday, the whole religious program took on new _per-
spective as student representatives and members of the
Religious Workers’ Fellowship met to. organize a binary
organization to further promote participation and leader-
ship in developing spiritual campus life. ' _
The proposed structure of the Pitt Student Religious
Council and the Advisory Committee on Religious activities
will allow for easy exchange of ideas between both’ clergy
and students. More than anything else, it should promote
inter-faith understanding at the University. _ _
Quite ,,possibly, the activities of the group, integrating
: persons ofvall /faiths as workers,. will antiquate the term
“tolerance” and replace it with “empathy”. The second word
is more suited to a college atmosphere which should, enable
students to understand . and sympathize with _another’s
thoughts, rather than to permit them merely to exist along-
' side. ' ”‘ ' I ‘ , _ _
So often, students come to Pitt engrossed _in childish
biblical stories or superstitious dpgma. which exist more in
their minds than in their church philosophy, that higher
education must be provided for religious as well as secular
ideas: ’ p ' ’
It’s a great deal easier to discuss iambic pentameter in
class than religious philosophy because of the emotional at-
titudes students might possess. But eventually professors

should be able to. discuss the topic without being overly.

cautious orlapologetic for fear their statements may prove
objectional, true or not. If peopleobject to presentations,
they should meet them with their own intelligence and
backgrounds rather than grumbling.

If they haven’t anything to express other than emotion-
al retort and still ﬁnd such arguments objectional, they had
best reevaluate their beliefs. '

This,: in effect, might be some
the binary religious group now writing a constitution. It
will provide elbow room for discussions among faith repre-
sentatives and clergy for empathy on campus, it wilf pro-
'mote higher education" in religious affairs, it should stress
individual education in religious. organizations, most- of
which now have their own academic program. ' . .

Eventually it will provide a permanent working nucleus
to run the annual Religion-in-Life program. , '

In four years, religion on campus has taken on added
meaning. ' The present innovation is the most important
move toward a fully intelligent program for college people.

Block "P" For Skeptics

Congratulations with a touch of gratitude are in order

for the Block ‘P” chairmen and their committees. They
have demonstrated to the disturbing ‘sophisticated skep-
tics’ that organization was the prime answer to student
apathy in the Pitt cheering section. .
,. A spirit of enthusiasm and cooperation was the sur-
prising result of weeks of workiand planning in the ﬂash-
card program. The same students who attended football
games last year waiting for an opportunity to catcall their
own team‘ suddenly lost‘ all such cynicism and entered into
the idea of cheering with at least an attitude of trying
anything once. '

Reports from\ the pressbox across the ﬁeld from the
block have been very‘ favorable. Of course there was con-
fusion and frequent error in’ theoperation, but this will
become less noticeable with practice.

The classical indifference of the Pitt student may not

be gone. Indeed, the remarkable showof spirit may prove’

to be a singular’ occurrence and never repeat itself,'or, more

likely, diminish with .a constant ‘rate to the old lack of’

' interest.

Regardless of these pessimistic possibilities, Block “l:'i‘:’/
has proven that the willingness to back a football team really
exists and will be expigessed with much encouragement
and planning._ Although the flashcard cooperation is not a
ﬁnal answer, it IS a gain in the right direction. The real
proof of its success will come if and when Pitt loses a
home game.

Sowell, Moore Pace Harriers

‘ By DON KAISERMAN

4 Arnie Sowell regained his winning form and so did the
-* Panther cross-country team as they outran Manhattan and
1 Army in a triangular meet at West Point Friday. ,

if " With Sowell copping individual honors in 27:04, the
fOlsonmen totaled 27 points to 34 for the Jaspers and 67
' for the-Cadets. 0"" —

' After running ﬁfth in last
week’s loss to Villanova, Sowell
__ romped home more than 50
myards ahead of the second man,
’.-Jim Moore, also of the locals.‘
 Wendell Harford ﬁnished a sur-
-prising ﬁfth, ashe ran what his
tean-if-mates described as “his best
race of the year.” Thornton Smith
,was a strong seventh while Tom
'.Jessup and Jack Shubert also ﬁn-
ished among the scorers.

Manhattan, the defending IC4A
‘champion, was weakened by the
loss of Bob. Sbarra, their number-
:one harrier, due to an ankle injury.
Jasper officials stated- that he
‘would be ready when the IC4A’s
roll ahround next month.

The West Point course was
well suited to the Panthers’ style
of running although it was a
ﬁve- trail as compared "to the
4.3 miles of the Schenley Park
route. .
‘Much of the path wound over
and under ski trails and was ex-
ceptionally hilly. In many respects,
fit was very similar to the local
_course.

Question—-I am a disabled Korea

New Councill\leeds

Student Cooperation

The success of the newly devised Pitt Student Religious
Council will depend upon the cooperation of the students,
according to the committee of ﬁve advisers, who ﬁrst dis-

cussed its possibilities.

The Rev. Earl T. Knaus, of the

II

ciation, hopes that the students realize the challenging op-
portunity on a campus like Pitt to ﬁnd Ways and means of

having religious activities which¢'

will preserve the identity of the
separate groups.

Committee Members

The committee, appointed by
Chaplain Luccock, included: Dr.
Edna Batz, YWCA adviser; Mr. -A1
Louden, YMCA adviser; the Rev.
Knaus; Rabbi Morris Feldman,
Hillel Foundation adviser, and
Father Demblowski, of the New-
man Club.

Louden believes many uni-
versities have similar patterns
for inter.-faith co-operation,
from which some of the propos-
ed ideas have been ‘borrowed.
The reason that“ Pitt _is so far.
behind is that only within the

' last years have religious groups

been organized on this campus.’
According to Rabbi Feldman,

cil is an important development
in the general growth of univer-

Ivy Leaguers 8-3,
Hear Duff Speech

The University of Pittsburgh
debate team, "coached by Robert

. Newman, yesterday completed the

Princeton debate series with two

' wins and two losses. These results,

however, enabled Pitt to win the
series, 8-3.

Of the three debates won by
Allan ,Hor.ovitz and Ronald Bo-
lognese of Princeton, one was
against Paul Balles‘ and Irving
Bloom, and two were against
Harriet Laby and Robert Sedler.
On Tuesday, Paul Balles and Irv-
ing Bloom were able to defeat

V Princeton in one event.

The Pitt debate team of Don
Levitt and Dick Cromie on Wed-
nesday, and Joe Montuoro and
Lynn Watson on Thursday were
successful in winning two events
each. The total score as of Wed-
nesday evening was 6-1 favor of
Pitt, thus assuring Pitt of an,-early
series victory.

, As a conslusion to the series, a
banquet was held last evening at

Plan Called Timely

Mrs. Batz feels that the plan is
a timely one, and that it deserves
the attention of the most maure
and best thinking minds on cam-
pus. She added that the drawing
together of a campus program will
interest many more students.
