Lady Gaga wasn’t the only person who
showed up to her concert sporting outra-
geous duds: many Pittsburghers donned
their own eye—grabbing ensembles, Gaga-
style.

Pitt junior Megan Piplica found out a
week ago that her friend had extra tickets
to the diva’s concert, and she began quickly
crafting a costume modeled after several
of the songstresses’ look. ‘

Piplica was among hundreds of Lady
Gaga’s “little monsters” — the name the

singer has bequeathedto her fans — who-

dressed up in full Gaga gear for the concert
at the Consol Energy Center Sunday.
“Some of the other little monsters were
out there planning a lot harder and longer
than-I was,” she said, adding that part of

A her research was Googling outﬁts other

fans had prepared.
Piplica, choosing to go the homemade

C route, ventured to_ Goodwill to ﬁnd com—

ponents for her costume. None of her

purchases were safe from scissors. She ,

cut up aiblack dress to make a leotard and
used leftover fabric for a bow. Part of her
handcrafted costume also included a deep
yellow, shoulder-padded jacket. She said
that it was reminiscent of Lady Gaga’s “Pa—
parazzi” video. ‘ '

Freshmen can have
rocky adjustment

Mallory Grossman
Staff Writer

Homesickness, making friends, ﬁnd-
ing classrooms and learning to do
laundry —— Conventional wisdom dic-
tates that incoming freshmen have
many adjustments to make during
their ﬁrst few weeks on campus.
James Cox, the director of Pitt’s
Counseling Center, said for the ﬁrst
few weeks of school most freshmen
just try to learn to live on their own.
Some students have never lived away

from home, he said, so the jump to

living independently can be stag-
gering. _

Some students reported adjust-
ing well — feeling relieved that their
ﬁrst days didn’t resemble the scarier
scenes in some movies. Butfor others
who might be longing for help, Cox of-
fered some suggestions for adjusting
to life on campus.

“Students that come from a small
area or a small high school can ﬁnd
the move to a large urban institution
overwhelming,” Cox said. O

While the invention of cell phones
and texting have reduced homesick-
ness on campus, students still have
some obstacles to overcome, he
said.

Some students, such as freshman
Catie Cohn, have smaller fears about
living on their own. '

“I am most scared-about laundry,”

»~ Cohn said. “I’ve never done it in my

life, that’s the one thing my mom al-
ways did for me.” V V
Though many students have their
own individual challenges to over-
come, one of the main difﬁculties
A almost all freshmen face is adjusting
to the workload andlearning how to
manage their time, Cox said.
“Most students areusedto master-

ing their work with little effort,” Cox
said. “But when they come here, they
ﬁnd out they actually have to study
and occasionally ask for help.”
Students seeking help with course
work have a number of resources at
their disposal, including the Academ-
ic Resource Center in the Gardner
Steel Conference Center. At the ARC,
students can attend study skills work-

shops and receive peer tutoring and V

advice from retention specialists.
Freshman Abby Czulada said she
can attest to the difference in work-
load from high school to college.
“PittStart scared me during ori-
entation when they said if you didn’t
study in high school, you’d fail here.

Now I actually have to study,” she

said. .
Some freshmen reported feeling

relieved after the ﬁrst week of class, '

Cohn among them.

“The classes actually aren’t scary,”
she said. “I thought it’d be like ‘Le-
gally Blonde’ where they kick you
out of class if you answer a question
wrong.” 

For the freshmen and upperclass-

menwho remain stressedduringthe ‘

ﬁrst few ‘weeks of school, there are
plenty of resources on campus to help
managethe strain, Cox said. He sug-
gests consulting Resident Assistants
and First Year Mentors, taking part
in the First Year Experience program
and getting involved in organizations
on campus. .

Cox also recommends that stu-
dents attend sports games and other
events to begin feeling like they are a
part of the campus community.

“No student can say that there’s A

nothing to do,” Cox said. “Even just
ﬁnding people that have things in
common and making new friends

Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh
has asked a county-wide agency

that the money will be enough to
keep it from closing branches in
four areas.

The library systemwill likely
have to wait two months before
it ﬁnds out whether it will receive
the extra money it requested when
it ﬁled a modiﬁed budget late last
month with the Allegheny Regional
Asset District, a group of ofﬁcials

county taxes and the state treasur-
er’s ofﬁce to local libraries, parks
and sports facilities.

Money from RAD accounts for
more than three-quarters of the

library’s annual budget, according

for an extra $2 million, in hopes <

who distribute money from two .

Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh displays pamphlets to encourage donations at the main branch in Oakland.

V to docurneintstavailable online. If

the library receives its one-time
9.8 percent increase, it will get just
under $19.4 million from RAD.

, -Until ,it-hears;R,AD’.s verdict,

“[RAD] will not vote or do their
budget until the end of September
or beginning of October, so we will

' not know exactly what our bu,d- -

get is and if they have granted us
any additional money for stopgap
funding,” said Suzanne Thinnes,
the library’s communications
manager.

Julie Goetz, RAD’s communi-
cations manager, said results re-
ceived in September or October
might not be ﬁnal.

“The preliminary budget dead-
line_is set for Sept. -30, and then
there is ‘a time for public hearing

and comment, and then the board
will announce its ﬁnal budget on
or around Nov. 30,” said Goetz,
who also said some county resi-
dents havelalready contacted her
to speak about the library.

Thinnes said it is too soon to tell
what will happen and whether the
library will have to enact its con-
troversial 2009 Action Plan that
would close a number of branches
in Beechview, the West End, Law-
renceville and Hazelwood.

“Our board will meet in October
and we’ll have a better idea then,”

When the library’s board director ap-
peared in front of the RAD board, she indi-
cated that the library’s request would be a
one-time move. Any money given by RAD
would be used to shore up the $3 million

including an additional»1.9 percent in cuts
made recently when Gov. Ed Rendell decided
to reduce the budget by 1.9 percent across
the board, decreasing funding for state de-
partments as well. —

The latest cut will reduce library funding
by an additional $1.2 million, which is 10.1

percent less than the 2009-10 year.
Pittsburgh City Council authorized

$640,000 in aid last year for the library

system to keep all of its branches open, but
with continuous cuts, the library system still
requires additional funding to maintain its
current services and account for rising costs,
according to the Carnegie Library website.

The library has encouraged community
members to make donations or volunteer
time to help maintain current services, hours
and programs. Further information about
donations can be found on the library sys-

Being vegetarian not i
a, flexible position

What is a ﬂexitarian? Although it prob-
ably sounds like someone who’s good in
bed, it actually refers to a person who is
a part-time vegetarian.

Wait, what?

Time recently ran a piece on.“week-
‘day vegetarians,” or those who are only
vegetarian part time. According to the
article, flexitarians choose what to eat
and when.

We thought those were called omni-
vores.

Only a very small percentage of Amer-
icans are strict vegetarians: about 2.5
percent as estimated by the American
Dietetic Association. P

So, can the rest of us be considered
partial vegetarians? After all, we choose
what to eat and when. And if not, when
can one legitimately be considered a par-
tial vegetarian?

Do those people who partake in Meat-

less Monday but eat meat the rest of the A

week count as flexitarians? Does avoid-
ing the tacos at Market Central make us
ﬂexitarians too? '

The livestock industry produces 18
percent of the world’s greenhouse gases,

ety just have a need to divide everything

Time reports. Encouraging people to eat
less meat is therefore a good move for the
environment. A

We aren’t scoffing at the number of
animals that are saved by Meatless Mon-

people go meatless forjust one day. We
understand that partial vegetarianism is
more user—friendly. People can eat fewer
animals and help the environment with-
out making a huge commitment to never
eat a Five Guys burger again.

But why do we give something like
that a label? Does it really deserve one?

the many compromises of his presidency

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Nostalgia for more than just ‘old geezers’

Although they haven’t lived as long, ‘young geezers’ still like to tell stories from ‘backin theirday’

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

The dullest stories that can be told usu-
ally begin, “When I was your age, back
in the good old days...” This is usually a
signal to turn up your'iPod, which Grandpa
can’t hear anyway,’ look interested or at
least awake, and tune out. This _talent_of
looking interested is mastered at a young
age, and your average youth does a better
job of it than anyone this side of a spec-
tator at a House hearing featuring Alan
Greenspan.

Of course, it’s easy to make wisecracks
about the elderly, but back when I was
a freshman, when things were simple,
when we had to read books and not those
newfangled Kindle things, back when edu-
cation was valued for a change, we had
to  hey, wait — look at me when I’m
talking to you!

I have found myself becoming some-
what nostalgic recently, and I wouldn’t
be surprised to ﬁnd other upperclassmen
feeling the same way. Hell, they do feel the
same way.]ust listen to them gas on about
Steelers riots and G-20 riots and victories
against West Virginia. Listen to them talk
about Snowmageddon and Luke Raven-

stahl and the Tuition Tax of Doom.

As these young geezers demonstrate,
there is something universal about nos-
talgic sentiment. Why? Why do we dwell
onthe past, even when objectively there
isn’t much past to dwell on? _

I’m not a psychologist or a philosopher.
I’m a chemist. And I long for the days when
all science was called Natural Philosophy
and all natural philosophers dabbled in
everything. So, for old t-ime’s sake, please
indulge my dabbling. " j _

A key element of nostalgia is storytell-
ing. These could be the stories we bore
other people with or ones that we run
over and over again in our heads. This
storytelling element may go a long way
toward explaining why we sometimes live
in the past.

Humans are driven to tell stories,
and to enjoy them, almost from birth. As
“The Odyssey” or “One Thousand and One
Nights” or the Bible demonstrate, this
drive transcends time, place and culture.
We also. nevertireof hearing the same
story told slightly different ways, as in the

case of the ﬂood of Noah and that of “The '

Epic of Gilgamesh,” or like every Disney
sequel you’ve ever seen. "

Stories that actually happened, and
most importantly, actually happened to

us — now those are the most interesting.
We are certain to be sympathetic with the

M major players. As we usually like ourselves,

personal accounts have a clear protago-
nist. Because we are intimately involved
with these stories, we empathize. We don’t
have to imagine what it was like to be a
person in the story. We are one. ,
Aditionally, we best remember sto-
ries we were a part of. It is much harder
to rememberthe joke about the guy who
_did the stuff in the place than it is to re-
member when I fell into a public fountain
in Evanston, Ill., sometime in the summer

-of 1995.

Stories that form our lives are easy to
tell, so'we tellthem. And as we love to talk,
we tel1.them often.

Of course,when we tell these anec-
dotes, we don’t have to tell them truthfully.
The inherent ﬂexibilityof the past is also a
reason for nostalgia. We might not be able
to inﬂuence past events without the help
of the writers of “Back to the Future” or
“Star Trek,” but we can inﬂuence how the
events are remembered. We can_ compare
the past to the present while conveniently
forgetting that the problems and annoy-
ances that plague us now are essentially
timeless, and plagued us then as well.

This ﬂexibility of the past means it

takes whatever shape we want it to, and
the shape is usually pleasing.

In a tribute to the early days of exis—
tentialism, those days that were just so
much more meaningless than today, I’ll
go out on a limb.

Nostalgia is the result of consciousness
of one’s own mortality. Time slips by, and
its passage brings us ever closer to our
confrontation of the great unknown. So,

we cling to our lives for dear life, with a ,_

constant desire for yesterday to be today
again.

We speak of our pasts also as a guar-
antee that they will not be forgotten. And

i when our pasts are not forgotten, we aren’t

forgotten either. Finally, at least, our lives
have accomplished something! ’

And, of course, nostalgia speaks to the
human desire to live in better times. There
are only two directions to look for times
that aren’t the present, and the past is
one of them. So, a nostalgic is a kind of
an “anti—futurist”.

By-whatever explanation, nostalgia is

I a potent emotion that courses through us

all. If you’ll excuse me, I have to go pretend
to be Henry VIII. '

Sadly, nobody writes letters anymore. _

Obama deserves credit fortryingto get-. rid of p

Green 4 8

opportunity for Obama to rally his base
and rejuvenate some of the energy in
the Democratic Party, especially with
midterm elections just a few months
away. He could have pumped us up, but
instead, most of his speech was cautious,
even somber.

Rather than concentrate on the vic-

tory, he split time during the 18-minute

speech emphasizing other issues cur-
rently troubling our country: the war
in Afghanistan and, most pressingly,
the ‘economy. He even handed the olive
branch to. Bush, remarking, “It’s well
known that he and I disagreed about the

' war from its outset. Yet, no one can doubt

President Bush’s support for our troops
or his love of country and commitment
to our security.” ,

He even wore an American flag lapel
pin. s

Yet despite my initial criticism, it now
appears to me that Obama was doing ex-
actly what he should do: attempting to
unite a nation that is being tugged at from
both sides, ripping it down the middle

and leaving our country in a political
stalemate that has blocked progress at
a time we truly need it.

Unfortunately —— though not surpris-
ingly -— the far Right and, particularly,
the far Left did not see it this way.

Obama’s speech drew’ every criticism

_ imaginable.

, It was too focused “on the ‘huge price’
and burdens of the last seven years,” ac-

" cording to the Wall Streetjournal. It was

too complimentary of Bush, according to
Rache1‘Maddow. It was too disjointed, ac-
cording to The Washington Post’s Richard
Cohen. And'Chris Matthews complained
that Obama is still too dependent on his
teleprompter. Trust me, the list goes on.
And on. And on.

‘ Granted, there was some positive

feedback.

The New York Times appreciated
Obama’s sober tone. “There was no vic-
tory to declare last night, and Mr. Obama
was right not to try,” the newspaper wrote
in its Tuesday editorial. “If victory was
ever possible in this war, it has not been

won, and America still faces the daunt-
ing challenges of the other war, in Af-
ghanistan.”

Strangely enough, in what I’m sure
caused him actual physical pain, ultra-
hawkish Bill Kristol also parceled out
a rare, though still backhanded, com-
pliment, according to Politico, saying,
“Not a bad tribute to the troops and not
_a bad statement of the importance and
indispensability of hard power. Not a bad
speech by the president  On the whole
commendable and even at times impres-
sive.” Of course, I have no doubt he said

. all this with about as much enthusiasm

as a tepid fish, but still.

It’s really a shame that more people
couldn’t appreciate what Obama hoped
to accomplish in his address — though
it was far from perfect —-— and that he
continues to accumulate criticism from
every political direction for nearly every
thing he does. For those who chide his
comments regarding Bush, re—read the
speech. You’ll see that everything he says
is true. Even as an ardent Bush hater, I

artisan politics

can adinit this.
For those-who expected some kind of
celebratory balloon drop while K0018: the

‘Gang played in the background and Mr.

Moviefone announced that everyone in
attendance just won a free trip to Disney
World, ask yourself if it is really worth
celebrating anything that resulted in the
death of more than 4,400 Americans.

For Chris Matthews, get over the tele-
prompter. We elected Obama for his ideas
and intelligence, not for his ability to
memorize a speech. Seriously —— who
cares? .

Obama is operating out of one of the
worst political climates in recent his-
tory — his approval rating is a dismally

low 24 percent, according to Rasmussen _

Reports — and it is very, very likely that

he will not be re-elected-come 2012-. Yet ~

despite all this, and though politically
unwise, Obama is still trying to do away
with partisan politics. For that, I give him
a lot of credit.

Ohad Cadji I Visual Editor

Pitt students Megan Piplica, in yellow, and Chelsea Meyer, far right, prepare to show off the costumes they made while CCAC student

Lady Gaga( 1

“I’m hoping there’s going to be a lot of
other people dressed up with me, and we
can bond over our love of Gaga,” Piplica
said before going to the show.

In the city that fostered one of Lady
Gaga’s icons, Andy Warhol, it seems more
than just fans got dolled up with Piplica
for the event. The Art Institute of Pitts-
burgh got its Gaga on by outﬁtting their
giant Creation Rex like the diva, creating
a “Gaga-saurus Rex.”

Fans didn’t just bring costumes to emu— ’

late the superstar — they brought her
often complicated dance moves as well.
Piplica admitted to knowing the dances
for “Bad Romance” and “Alejandro” and
planned to bust out her moves when the
time came. She also wasn’t afraid to break
out her “Gaga claws” as Piplica called
them -— the“Thriller”-like c1aw—hands
that the singer includes in some of her
choreography.

“I love my Gaga,” she said, detailing the
Gaga-themed party that included “disco
stick kabobs,” “b1ufﬁn’ with my mixed
berry muffins” and “pasta—razzi” that she
and friends threw for the Glee episode
featuring the singer.

And a vast number of people —— young,

, old, male and female — who came out to

see Lady Gaga belt out her chart—topping
hits share Piplica’s enthusiasm.

Among the line dwellers who arrived
early for the big event were some spec-
tacular Gaga impersonators. A young girl
outﬁtted herself in the infamous red lace,
literally head—to—toe ensemble, complete
with crown, that the singer wore to the
2009 VMAs. An older man sported ablack
and silver apparatus that poked out from
the shoulder of his suit jacket in daring
spikes, along with a ,super—high pair of
silver platform shoes.

Steven Sims, of Cleveland, had previ-
ously attended ﬁve Lady Gaga concerts,
sometimes traveling as far as five or six
hours outside of his city to see her.

Sims sported a translucent, mauve
bodysuit that shimmered in the sun-
light. He wore an illuminated black cross
stitched to his chest and a mask crowned
with lights and rhinestones and topped
off with a spray of feathers.

“I’m going to be right up front, and I

want her to notice me,” he said.

It’s Sims’ special bond with the star’s
outlandish antics and bold artistic state-
ments that makes Lady Gaga such a big

Nicolina Diliscia helps with makeup.

part of his life.
“I feel like I’ve been set free. I don’t
worry about what people think about me

v anymore. I know I’m a rock star. I was born

that way, and that’s the connection I get
with her,” he said.

Another devoted fan, who wore a giant
silver chain and caution tape crossing on
his chest, explained that‘he’s been a fan
“since the beginning of Gaga.’-’ He wielded
a sign that proclaimed, “We want your Bad
Romance Gaga!” ' I ‘

“I think she’s a genius,” he said, “I really

think she’s an icon for sure, and I think

she’s going to godown in history.”

Much like KFC and Coca—Cola, Lady
Gaga seems to have her own coveted se-
cret recipe, but hers is for writing pop
music that’s overwhelmingly catchy. And
Pittsburghers were all too excited to belt
it right along withher.

As for the dressing up and the ready
theatricality of Pittsburgh’s “little mon-
sters,” Piplica explained that it’s just a
way to make the show that much more
entertaining. ,

‘‘It’s not just the concert, it’s the expe-
rience  I’m prepared to sing every lyric
and scream my head off,” she said. 

Stop stealing
music to

buy fashion

Merritt Wuchina
Staﬁ” Writer

It doesn’t cost much to have good taste in
music these days. But it does cost to be in
style. .

H A few weeks ago, I went to ‘Carnegie Mel-
lon’s' Rangos Ballroom to see the band The
Books. They put on a great performance,
and for only $10 it was one of the best con-
cert deals of the summer. Before their last
song, bassist Nick Zammuto addressed the
audience:

“You know, we have this thing called
CDs out there. If you’d like to buy one, see
us after the show. We have little children
at home too.”

The band members went on to play the
song “Classy Penguin” along with a video
of children laughing and playing — a subtle
reminder to the audience of the time away
from their families that they sacriﬁced to
go on tour.

I The group actually stopped recording
music for ﬁve years because increased il-
legal ﬁle sharing put a dent in their income.
In a 2007 interview, Zammuto said that he
arrived in cities where only a few albums
were sold yet hundreds of people showed
up to the concert.

Looking around the room at CMU, I
wondered how many people had actually
bought The Books’ album. I knew I hadn’t,
and I felt a twinge of shame for knowing the
songs without actually owning them. While
contemplating this, I began to notice that
most of the students at the show were quite
fashionable.’ There were girls with tattoos
and Urban Outﬁtters jeggings and boys with
iPhones and American Apparel hoodies.
How many would run to the merchandise
table and buy a T-shirt rather than a CD?

We make plenty of excuses for why we
can’t afford to pay for music. Look at the
numbers —- it would take about $7,425 to
ﬁll a 30GB iPod at 99 cents" a song. That’s
about the same cost of a semester’s tuition at
Pitt. And that’s noteven for the largest iPod.
That might sound exorbitant, but consider
the price of a pair of pants from American
Apparel— that $75 would get you seven
albums. For a week’s worth of Starbucks
grande lattes, you could buy two albums.

Pitt Arts’ Cheap Seats program makes art affordable

Natalie Bell
A€rE Editor

Ordinarily, tickets in section B for the
Pittsburgh Opera would cost about
$100.75. Through Pitt Arts’ Cheap Seats
program, a student can buy those same
tickets for $33. , .

“I’m constantly negotiating so that
everyone gets a really good deal here at
Pitt through the Cheap Seats program,”
said Annabelle Clippinger, director of Pitt
Arts.

Tomorrow, at the annual “Attack of
the Cheap Seats,.”held in the William Pitt

Union Assembly Room from noon to 2
p.m., students have theoption of purchas-
ing discounted tickets for entire seasons
while enjoying a free lunch. Students can
also purchase these tickets by stopping
by the Pitt Arts ofﬁce in 316 William Pitt
Union. ‘ ’

Normally, when students buy ‘tickets,
they are givenithe best available seats in
the section they’ve chosen. New this year,
and only during Attack of the Cheap Seats,
students can choose their section and seat
ahead of time. One of the big benefits of
this deal is that students, as some of the

Paying for music matters

Wuchina ( 10

Every day we need more and more music
to ﬁll our snappy gadgets, but we’re buying
less and less of it. And the leftover cash goes
into fueling our fashionable wardrobes.

Of course, counterculture fashion and
music have always been related. The hippies
patched their ripped-upjeans — they didn’t
buy them “destroyed” —— the punks pulled
seams together with safety pins and the
grunge rockers hung around in outdoors-
man ﬂannel. These styles were cheap and
durable andthe rockers separated them-
selves from the rest of society by wearing
lower—class garb. But although these people
might have been among society’s poor and
rejected, I’m sure they didn’t skimp when
it came to building great record collec-
tions. P

~ Although hipsters today are supposed
to be known for their thriftiness, I ﬁnd it
strange that pricey stores like Urban Outﬁt-
ters have capitalized on their trends. The
faded—graphic shirts have goofy slogans,
like things you’d pull off the rack at Good-
will, and the retro dinner sets could have

Now that we’re surrounded by so many

stylish things to buy, why should music, a

. practically free commodity, take priority
on our shopping lists? , - V

Well, because the future of music de-

pends on it. Musicians like The Books don’t
go into their professions to make oodles
of money. _

Sure, there are plenty of talented peo-
ple looking for fame, but among the indie
crowd there is a strong desire to make beau—.
tiful music for even a modest living. T

The effects of illegal ﬁle sharing might

not seem immediate, but if we as a society ’

continue this behavior, many more talented
musicians might start dropping out of the
music circuit to earn a living wage. And
really, who can blame them?

Fortunately, we have the option to pre-
view music before we buy it, using stream-

ing sites like MySpace and Pandora, and ,

don’t have to rely on Top—4O radio. Every-
one wins —— the independent musicians get
to spread their music and the consumers
get to sample the album before buying.

I am in no way saying you need to drop
out of college so you can legally ﬁll your
iPod with songs. Borrowing C_Ds from the
library and buying used are all affordable

' ways to discover new music.

But next time you pull out your wallet
topay for that grande latte or pair of jeans,
think about how good it would feel to really
indulge yourself in purchasing a new album

every now and then instead. Your ears will

thank you for it. I

MOVIE REVIEW

Movie goes the distance
BINGTHE  C

Movie characters Erin and Garrett fall in love despite an inevitable long-distance affair.

Bethie Girmai
Staff Writer

In this current dry spell of successful romantic
comedies, frustrated chick-ﬂick loversﬁnally
have a reason to rejoice. “Going the Distance”
rises well above the bar that recent rom-coms
have set. .

After so many disappointments in the genre
— think, “All About Steve,” “The Back—up Plan”
and “Did You Hear About the Morgans?” — it
was difficult to imagine “Going the Distance”

A having a different fate.

The ﬁlm, starring Drew Barrymore and
Justin Long, chronicles the long-distance re-
lationship of couple Erin and Garrett.

When the two meet in New York, the con-
nection is evident and the star—crossed lovers
begin to cultivate a relationship. But, Erin soon
confesses that she is only in New York for the
summer to intern at a magazine and plans
to return to her hometown of Los Angeles in
three weeks. I if

Once her short stay has come to a close,

Erin and Garrett decide to pursue their rela— '

tionship, despite the daunting thousands of
miles that separate them. And soon enough,
cross-country visits and the vast amount of

distance begin to wear on the couple and put.

a strain on their relationship.

In addition to learning to cope with dis-
tance, the movie touches on themes such as
inﬁdelity and the seVen—month itch.

The ﬁlm’s dialogue is witty and fast—paced.
Surprisingly, the script was original and man-
aged to escape the mold of a typical rom—com.
This, in addition to relatable subject matter,
helped the movie keep a brisk pace.

Though it lasted roughly two hours, the
length was owing to a continuum of relevant
scenes and entertaining quips, and it didn’t
drag on.

The movie’s all—star cast helped make the A

most of its stellar script. Although‘ Drew Bar-
rymore and Justin Long put on great perfor-
mances as the ﬁlm’s stars, itwas the supporting
actors who stole the spotlightjason Sudeikis of
“Saturday Night Live” and Charlie Day of “It’s
Always Sunny in Philadelphia” play Box and
Dan respectively, Garrett’s two best friends.]im
Gafﬁgan, who plays Erin’s brother-in-law, has a
minor role but his lines offer much—appreciated
comic relief. But Christina Applegate, who
plays Erin’s sister, Corinne, proves to be the
highlight of themovie with her one-liners.
So, ladies, if you’re looking for a romantic

- comedy, “Going the Distance” will satisfy every

girly ﬁber of your being and renew your hope

in chick flicks. I

ﬁrst ticket buyers, will have access to the
best seats in the house. _

“My theater is great because I don’t
have a student section ... you could be in
the front row if I ‘have it available,” said
Becky Rickard, group sales and audience
development manager for the Pittsburgh
Public Theater.

This year, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust,

Pittsburgh Public Theater, Pittsburgh CLO
Cabaret, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra,
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre and Pittsburgh
Opera will all be present, giving students
the opportunity to buy some of the very
best tickets they have to offer. _

“They can actually watch the diva sweat
when she’s singing or they can listen to the
pointe shoes [of the ballet dancers on the
stage],” Clippinger said.

It’s obvious how students can greatly
beneﬁt from the program.

“I think the great thing about the Cheap
Seats program is that the tickets that we’re
selling are at a discounted rate and [stu-
dents] get to come and experience some-
thing that adults experience for much more
expensive tickets,” Rickard said.

But one might wonder how selling such

. inexpensive tickets to students beneﬁts -

the arts organizations. 5

“Once [students] get out of Pitt, they’re
hooked. It develops an arts patronage and
a habit of attending the arts,” Clippinger
said.

She explained that the Pitt Arts pro-
gram exposes students to the wonders
of the arts ‘around them, giving them a
more colorful view of the Pittsburgh scene
than they would get just hanging around
campus. Once they develop the habit-, stu-
dents continue to support the arts well
after graduation, when they have more
expendable funds to put toward tickets,
Clippinger said. ’

In addition, the students’ youthful pres-
ence brings new life to theatrical perfor-
mances that other audience members and

' arts participants both appreciate.

Pitt earns first winover Tulane

Senior middle hitter Imani Harper goes up for a kill in last weekend’s Pitt Invitational. She helped lead the team to its ﬁrst win.

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ” Writer

After winning only one set in six losses to start
géthe season, the Pitt women’s volleyball team
found a way to put a mark in the win column‘
during the Pitt Invitational this weekend.
The Panthers hosted the invitational —
which welcomed Lipscomb and Purdue in

addition to Tulane — as a way to prepare for -

Big East Conference play, which begins in the
{ﬁnal week of September.

In the ﬁrst match of the tournament, Pitt
faced Purdue, a Big Ten team that consistently
earns NCAA Tournament bids and, according
to head coach Toby Rens, is a strong competi-
tor.

q

I/Purdue 3, Pitt 0

“With our ﬁrst match against Purdue, we will

deﬁnitely have a good idea on what we need ,

to improve upon,” Rens said. “They are a team

that always plays at a very high level.”

/' '5? That level of play was evident, as the Boiler-
makers beat the Panthers in three straight sets
with scores of 25-18, 25-23 and 25-20.

The matches taught the Panthers that they
need to improve offensively, since they typi-
cally out-dig their opponents on defense.

In the ﬁrst set, the Panthers showed their
ability to match the play of Purdue and man-

‘ aged to keep the score tight, at one point trail-

ing 14-13. But the experience of the Boilermak-
ers allowed them to push ahead with a 6-0 run
and eventually take the set. p

Despite a 3-0 loss, the Panthers did ﬁnd
points of encouragement to lead into their
next match against Lipscomb.

Senior outside hitter Amy Town led the
Panthers with nine kills against Purdue, and
in her performance, solidiﬁed her role as a
team leader. ' ,

“As our captain, Amy has been a complete
player for us,” Rens said. “The rest of the team
looks to her for leadership as they continue to
work hard and come together as a group.”

Lipscomb 3, Pitt 0

The next opponent for Pitt was Lipscomb,
but the positives the Panthers carried over
from the previous match did not result in a
victory.The Panthers were once again blanked
3-0 by scores of 25-15, 25-17 and 25-13.

The ﬁrst set of this match took a route op— _

posite that of the Purdue contest when the
Panthers found themselves in an early 9-3 hole
from which they never recovered.

Imani Harper, another Pitt senior and a
middle hitter recorded eight kills in the con-
test, but the Panthers as a team earned only
30 to Lipscomb’s 48.

The Panther defense also lost to Lipscomb
in the dig category, which is uncharacteristic
of Rens’ team. 1

“Defensively, at times, I feel that we are
better than most teams thatwewillface,” Rens
said. “Sometimes it is just a matter of trying
some things out and seeing where we are as
ateam.” . -

Defensive duties were distributed amongst
the Panthers, as four players recorded ﬁve or
more digs.

Pitt 3, Tulane 0

The persistence of the Panthers’ lineup ma-
neuvers did pay off in the ﬁnal match of the
Invitational as the Panthers earned their ﬁrst
win of the season against Tulane.

Despite the shutout victory, the Panthers
and the Green Wave battled for much of the

Pitt will
overcome  
loss to Utah

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

 

So, Pitt lost its ﬁrst game of the year. I’ve al-
ready seen many fans throw their hands up in
the air and say, “typical Pitt.” And they have a
valid point.

Pitt always seems to get fans’ hopes up, only
to fall short in the most dramatic way pos-
sible — think about the Cincinnati football
game last year and the basketball team’s last
two NCAA Tournament exits versus Xavier
and Villanova.

But losing to Utah in the ﬁrst game isn’t that
bad — it’s not like the Panthers lost to Bowling
Green at home or anything. So for my Top 10
this week, I give you 10 reasons it isn’t the end
of the world.

Pitt actually started the sea-
son on the road — against a
. 0 good team. Only six other top-

25 teams opened the season on the-road. And
only three of those traveled to other ranked
teams, whereas the other three basically took
vacation trips for easy wins. No. 12 Wiscon-
sin went to Las Vegas and crushed UNLV, and
No. 14 USC went to Hawaii where they also
conquered.

Not many ranked teams are willing to open
against a tough team on the road —- especially
a team like Utah that hasn’t lost at home in
nearly three years. So the BCS voters will look
kindly on Pitt for its schedule.

Ray Graham didn’t even play, and

Pitt still almost won. Yes, Dion

0 Lewis is key to the-offense, and he

is going to be Pitt’s.No. 1 playmaker. But without
Graham, Pitt had to give the ball to Lewis on
nearly every running play. It wasn’t hard for
Utah to catch on and eventually stop him — so

of his 75 yards came in the ﬁrst half. So when ‘
Graham returns, likely this Saturday, he will see I

some carries and this will keep the defense on
its toes so it can’t just focus on Lewis.

Sunseri thrown in deep end, managed to survive, improve

Pitt still has chances to 2
prove itself against Mi-
0 ami and Notre Dame.
The Panthers have three big noncon-
ference games on the slate — home‘
against Miami and away at Utah and
Notre Dame. Yes, it would have been
nice for Pitt to win all three, but let’s
be honest here —— it wasn’t likely to
happen. If Pitt can beat Miami at ‘
home, that game will put the team
back on the map. And if it can win at
Notre Dame a few weeks later, then
- people will forget about this early
loss entirely.

Andrewjanocko made up
forthe Cincinnati gaffe.
O Quarterback Andrew .

Janocko remained calm at the end of
regulation time when he'had to hold
the ball for kicker Dan Hutchins to
try to tie the game. Thanks to Utah’s
head coach Kyle Whittingham icing
Hutchins — twice —]anocko had to
do it three times.

_ There is‘ no doubt that his infa-
mous gaffe against Cincinnati last
year — when he bobbled the snap
on an extra point and Pitt lost by

urtsy Lennie Mahler I Daily Utah Chronicle
Tino Sunseri attempts a pass in Thursday’s overtime loss‘ to Utah.

one point — was racing through his
mind. A mistake like that can haunt
a guy, butjano cko stayed steady and
helped Pitt tie the game. Now Pitt
knows it can rely on him again when
the game is on the line.

Pitt knows its weakness-
es. A good thing about
0 opening against a tough
team — and even losing is that the
team’s weaknesses become apparent
early in the season. Do you think
No. 1 Alabama discovered any of its
weaknesses when it pounded San
José State 48-3 on Saturday? Proba-
bly not. Now the Panthers know they
need to improve their pass coverage,
since several Utah receivers were left
undefended for touchdowns. Pitt
has-a slight reprieve and can work
on that against New Hampshire this
Saturday. ‘

The polls forget about

early losses. One ﬂaw —

O of many — in the college
football ranking system is tl1at losses
later in the season are more harmful
than early losses. When ateam loses,
it tends to drop farther in the rank-

ings than it deserves. Think about;
what will happen if the No. 10 team
loses to the No. 5 team. According to
the polls, the No. 10 team is actually
supposed to lose, but if it does it will
likely drop ﬁve to ten spots in the
rankings. So losing early is good.
Now Pitt has 11 games to climb back’
up in the rankings.

Tino Sunseri was thrown

4 into the deep end and sur-
0 vived. Florida also started

a new quarterback this year, butjohn
Brantley got a nice practice game

against Miami (Ohio) on Saturday
before he has to take on a tougher

‘ team when the Gators host South

Florida this Saturday. Sunseri didn’t
have that luxury. 5
Not only did he begin his career
as a starting quarterback on the
road, but it was in one of the tough-
est environments in college football.
The crowd noise is so loud that the
student section, keeps track of how
many false starts it creates. After
an understandably shaky ﬁrst half,

Sunseri played well in the second half and
even threw a nice 44-yard touchdown pass to
Jon Baldwin. Yes, he had one signiﬁcant error
with his interception in overtime. But if not for
Sunseri, the Panthers never would have made
it past regulation.

Utah is a good teamto lose to. Iwent

to the Hofbrauhaus Friday night, and

O for some reason it always turns into

a Pitt-Penn State-WVU battle with the crowd

chanting its teams’ names afterparticular

songs. After my friends tried to start a Pitt

chant after “Sweet Caroline,” the Penn State

fans started chanting “What about Utah?” And
I started thinking  what about them?

The Utes have more BCS bowl wins than
most other teams in the country over the past
ﬁve years. Utah is 2-0 in BCS bowls. They
beat Pitt in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl to cap off an
undefeated season. Then they had another
undefeated season in 2008 and knocked off
heavily favored Alabama in the 2009 Sugar
Bowl. That’s better than any Big East or Big
Ten team. _ ’ ‘

Some people say that there is no such thing
as a good loss, but in college football, because

of the flawed ranking system, there is such a
thing.

All the other Big‘ East favorites are

likely to have similar losses. West

0 Virginia and Connecticut both have

big road games. Connecticut traveled to Michi-

gan on Saturday and lost 30-10. WVU goes to

the bayou to play LSU on Sept. 25, which is one

of the toughest places in the country to play -

right up there with Utah. And Cincinnati plays

No. 7 Oklahoma at home. In all likelihood,

the Big East teams will probably lose all those

games. So we will be back to square one when
the conference slate starts.

It wasn’t a Big East game. Let’s face
it, Pitt probably wasn’t going to win
0 the national championship — even if
it beat Utah. The only games that truly matter
now are Big East games. So even if Pitt loses to
Miami and Notre Dame, it can stillwin the Big
East. That’s Pitt’s ticket to a BCS Bowl game.
So stop sulking and pick up your student
tickets at the Pete. I hope fans will realize the
season is not over and ﬁll Hei‘nz Field on Sat-
urday. I

In her best career performance, sophomore

In the ﬁrst two matches, Pitt earned a com-

MEN'S SOCCER

Pitt wins in double overtime for ﬁrst 2-0 start since 2002

Greg Trietley
Staﬁwri ter

It took two overtime periods to decide a
winner on Sunday, but thanks to the heroics
of Olutomi Ibikunle, the Pitt men’s soccer
team is off to a hot start.

A golden goal off the foot of Ibikunle
pushed Pitt past St. Bonaventure, 2-1, in

double overtime at Founders Field, as the

Panthers erased a second—half deﬁcit to take
down the Bonnies.

Ibikunle tapped the ball off an Andy
Kalas header past the Bonnies’ goalkeeper
David Flynn to give Pitt a 2-0 record to start
the year. V 4

‘‘‘Today’s game was what we needed,”
Pitt head coachjoe Luxbacher said. “It was
a good win over a good team.”

The Panthers fell behind early in the
contest when St. Bonaventure junior mid-
ﬁelder Chris Leko buried a cross pass from
Joshua Gonsalves and put the Bonnies up
1-0 in the 27th minute.

“In the ﬁrst half, we didn’t play as well,”
Luxbacher said. “We still had a couple good
chances, but they got a goal.”

The Panthers out—shot the Bonnies 5-3
in the opening half, but Flynn kept the
Panthers off the board. The stingy junior
goalkeeper earned a shutout in St. Bonaven-
ture’s season opener Wednesday against
Cleveland State. '

But Pitt senior midﬁelderjustin Boehm
cracked Flynn in the 61st minute with a
one-timer off a pass from Sam Luﬂ‘y to tie
the match. _

“The guys were resilient,” Luxbacher
said. “We made some adjustments at half-
time, but adjustments don’t really mat-
ter unless players go out and carry them
out.”

St. Bonaventure was playing three inside
midﬁelders, and Luxbacher said that the
Panthers were having difﬁculty with that
in the ﬁrst half. But after some strategy
changes at halftime, Pitt learned how to
overcome the midﬁelders.

“We dominated the second half,” he

said. ,

The Panthers controlled the game’s ﬂow
from there and out—shot St. Bonaventure 8-2
in the second half, though they were unable.

to capitalize on any moreof their chances. ' p
Ibikunle’s goal in the 105th minute capped
the victory and gave the Panthers their ﬁrst .

 

2-0 start since 2002.

“We’re getting good chances,” Luxbach-
er said. “We have so many good players
in there [offensively] that we’re going to
get better every game. At least that’s our
goal.”

The Panthers out-shot the Bonnies 17-7
for the game.

Pitt goalie Hami Kara made three saves
to record his second win in as many starts
as a Panther. Kara played the last two sea-

. sons at Manchester Community College,

where he earned NJCAA First Team All-
America honors.

“He’s a consummate professional in
how he approaches training and how he
mentally studies for the game,” Luxbacher
said. “We’re only two games in, but I guess
I like what I see.”

St. Bonaventure dropped to 1—1 for
the year with the loss. The team plays
at James Madison Thursday night. Pitt,

1'.

meanwhile, travels down Fifth Avenue to
face Duquesne at 7 p.m.

“We battled back [today] being a goal
down, which is tough,” Luxbacher said.

Last year, the Panthers only managed
one win and two ties, while losing the rest»
of their matches - including an exhibition "
loss to Duquesne. Tonight, the panthers
will look for redemption.

“Duquesne could be the next step.
They’re a good team,” Luxbacher said. I
