Smiles, Laughs Prevail
At Hand-in-Hand Fest  

 V By RICHARD COOK

By lI:30 a.m. Saturday, Forbes
Quadrangle was a sea of people.
Chaos seemed to abound
everywhere; groups of students
worked frantically to match'han-
dicapped children with student
volunteers, members of the food
committee wondered whether or

’ not they would have enough food '

for the 250 children, 900 volunteers,

and countless, number of adults,

and the children continued to arrive
in droves.

For‘ the first few hours of the
1980 Hand-In-Hand Festival for
children many
wondered "whether the huge Forbes

Quadrangle lobby was big_enough_

for such a large group of. people.
But ‘to 25. people that put the
festival together, the sometimes
cramped quarters was hardly
noticeable. This group noticed the

smiles,’ the screams of delight, and.

the laughter.
The second annual Hanc_l-In-

Jewish Festival Passover:

_ multi-faceted Jewishfestival, begins.

tomorrow. So-named because

Jewish homes were untouched;

“passed over”—by the last plague
brought down upon Egypt,
Passover is a joyous celebration o_f
freedom. It’. commemorates the
Jews’ ﬂight from Egyptian slavery
in ancient times (about 3200 years
ago), and thus celebrates the birth
of the Jewish nation." ‘

Hand" festival for handicapped
children was a success. - The
festival, which originated at St.
Joseph’s College near Philadelphia,
was "brought to Pitt. last year by
J ohri" .Fitzsimmon’s. Fitzsimmons
coordinated the 1979 'Hand-In-
Hand Festival and layed the
groundwork necessary to make it an
annual» event. Hand-In-Hand is
designed‘ to bring together physical-
ly and/or mentally handicapped

childrentfrom the Pittsburgh com-
munity with students of the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh for a day of

recreation. Each student volunteer
is paired with a handicapped child
and they spend the day enjoying the
various events of the festival.

This‘ year’s chairman, Harry’

Kuhn, estimated approximately 250
children~_'an'd 900 student volunteers
participated in ‘the 1980 festival.‘ ‘ _‘

“We came pretty close to doubl-

ing the amount of children from‘
last year, but we still hope for more . -

next year,” Kuhn explained.
The festival was sponsored in

The main purpose of this holiday
is‘ to relive the experience of slavery
through ceremonies that remember
the suffering and ultimate triumph
of ancestors, and to look with hope
to the future. In addition, Passover
is a nature festival, welcoming the
spring. It’s a holiday replete with
symbolism. '

month of Nissan. which corresponds
to, our months of March or April;
the Bible says this is the day of the
Jews’ exodus from Egypt. Only the
first and’ last days ate fullholidays;
in the interim, work proceeds as
usual.

The principle symbols of
Passover are the eating of unleaven-
ed (without yeast) bread called Mat-
zoh, and the complete avoidance of
all leavened food. There ‘are multi-
ple meanings given to this key sym-

bol,* but, as Rabbi Joseph H.
Levine, Director of B’nai B‘rith
Hillel says, “one of the rich parts of
Passover is its richness of inter-
pretation.”

One explanation‘ for Matzoh is .

that in their haste to leave Egypt,
the Israelites did not have time to
leaven their bread’ and, hence, ate
Matzoh. For some -people,
however, Matzoh,
‘.‘bread of poverty” or “bread of
affliction,” is symbolic of slavery

called the‘

   Joyous Celebration of Freedom 

and the kind of unappetizing’ food
the poor‘ must eat. Thus it has a
more universal connotation as well.

Whatever meaning one prefers,

the eating of Matzoh ‘and “the  -A
avoidance of yeast, both central to -

Passover, serve to keep the spirit of
the “holiday alive throughout the

week-long celebration, according to "

Levine. _ .

As finals loom ever closerand the
‘school year approaches its end
many students are starting to think
about getting a summer job. The

D Work Study Office located on the
. 3 third floor of Bruce Hall, is an ex-
cellent starting place to find sum-

menemployment. _

There are two individual work
study programs which students may
apply for. There are on-campus
jobs for those in the Pittsburgh area
and those attending school this
spring or summer. ,

The other program is sponsored
by PHEAA (Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance‘ Agency) and
allows students" to get jobs in their
home towns over the summer as

. ' long as they live in Pennsylvania.

“A supplemental allocation of
1.25 million dollars from the federal

' government has made this “home-

town” program possible. This pro-
gram is also inclusive of graduate
students. In order to be eligible for
these programs you must: have a

“This new funding has let us ex-

Albano, “A lot of students don't
realize that they can work full-time
without attending classes.”

Kathleen Miskovich, an assistant
in the work study program said,
“Students can work either full- or
part-time, and now they have the
choice of staying here or working in
their home-town if they are ac-
cepted by the program.”

which is held on the first two nights
of the holiday. It is a family or com-
munal gathering and feast called the
Seder (from the Hebrew meaning
‘‘order’’). ‘

Part of the tradition of the Seder
is to invite friends to the gathering.
It is considered an honor to have
people of different religions and
cultures at the Seder table.

At the Seder, the story of the ex-

odus is retold from a book called ‘

the Haggadah (from the Hebrew
meaning “to tell”). Various foods
are eaten that symbolize the hard-
ships of the Jews during their bon-
dage. these special dishes include
Matzoh; parsley, symbolizing spr-
ing; bitter herbs, emblems of the
bitterness of slavery; wine,

a cup is poured for Elijah——the pro-
phet whom Jews-believe will be the
herald of the good new of the com-
ing of the Messiah; a mixture of ap-
ples, nuts, and wine reminiscent of
the mortar used to mix bricks dur-
ing slavery. These and‘ other
ceremonial foods are held up and
their meanings are explained.

Prayers are said and, after the
recitation of the Haggadah, songs
are sung. . C

Children have a special role at the
Sedar. A special Matzoh called the
Afikomen (from the Greek for
“dessert”; it symbolizes the
sacrifice. of the Paschal lamb, a
tradition that no longer exists) is
hidden and the children receive
prizes for finding it. This tradition
adds to the children’s fun and sense

'of involvement. The Seder service is
not complete- without the
Afrikomen, said Levine.

In keeping with the spirit of the
holiday, people are free to develop
the Seder service in their own way,
says Rabbi Levine. In fact, it is
customary to embellish the Seder
with things of one’s own creation.
For example, an extra Matzoh is
often held up as a symbolic “Mat-
zoh of Hope” for persecuted Soviet
Jews.

The center stage was the scene of
various mime acts, sing-a-longs,
and performing clowns. The day
ended with all the members of the
Hand-In-Hand ‘ committee -ileading
the tired but happy gmn‘13"inl a final

Although the festival is primarily
designed’ for the handicapped

children, there is another purpose in ~
mind.

“We want to get the students at
Pitt to see some of the special pro-
blems of the handicapped,” ex-
plained Mary Beth Deering who
was in charge of volunteer
recruitment. “Almost everyone

feels uncomfortable around the
handicapped until they see that they
are people who want to enjoy life
just like anyone else.”

“The funny thing about the
festival,” Deering observed, “by
the end of the day, it is harder to tell
who had "a better time; the children
or the students.”

According to board president Bill Abraham the by-
laws were rewritten because “committees aren’t

elections. ‘
This might , be a good opportunity to remind
Abraham ‘and the other members of Student Govern-
ment that they are products of a “popular election

Kimbo/Smith Principle: Students Striving» forlncompetence

By MARGI STUMPF

The Peter Principle: in a hierar-
chy every employee tends to rise to
his highest level of incompetence.

' —Dr. Laurence J. Peter

If you reword this theory but
maintain the basic message, you get
the apparent present ideology of
student affairs administrators Con-

ney Kimbo and Andy Smith.

The Kimbo/Smith Principle: In 0

' student body, every student rises to

hislevel of incompetence, voted to
that level in a popularity contest.
This holds particularly in regard to
student media. V ‘
How true. There is, so much
evidence to support this theory. We
are awash in a sea of incompetence.
For example, in 1979 we at The

Pitt News sanctioned an editorial "

board, that won us twelve Penn-
sylvania Collegiate Press Associa-
tion Awards. Forgive us, Lord, for
we knew not what we did.

In 1979, we also .elected an
unknown from’ WPGH.to serve as
our account executive. He impress-
ed us as being suave and
sophisticated and we based our

_ votes on this, thinking that anyone
-with such credentials ought to be
f halfway intelligent.

WPGH, is a’classic example of the
Kimbo/Smith Principle. ‘Their
plumbs of popularity have gone on
to be sports directors, producers,
assignement editors, and on-air
reporters for KDKA, WYDD,
WTAE TV_ and WWSW.' . My
God. How frightening to know
that the students at WPGH have
not only pushed their worst to the
ultimate levels of incompetence at
Pitt but let them gain experience so
they could release their ineptitude

on the city of Pittsburgh. Shudder. ~

Yes, therejs plenty to support the

Kimbo/Smith Principle. It is-amaz- -

ing ' that we—student journalists,

‘~ poets, essayists, newscasters—have
’ not discovered before’that we don’t

vote for ability but for friendship.
Meatheads aren’t we? ,
lt’s a good thing we have people
in high places to point this out to
us, to abolish a totally lu_dicrous
system of appointment that has for
decades made Pitt’s student media
the laughing stock of the country.‘
Yup, the student affairs office
proposal has really made me think

about our ability to judge quality. -

We can’t. And because this is so, I’
have also begun to re—evaluate some
of my other judgments.

I no longer believe that Student
Government Board elections, or
example, are nothing but a measure’
of appeal. How could this be when
last year we voted in one of the
most competent boards Pitt has
ever seen. We had a board member .
who rarely made an appearance at
meetings, and another who came
_very close to bringing down on Pitt
the wrath of the federal guardians
of the Buckley Amendment.

We deﬁnitely voted for com-
petence that year. No need to apply

A the student affairs office proposal

here. _ _ V 

I’ve also had to re—evaluate my
opinion of the division of student
affairs. ~ Until this past week I
thought that some members of the
administration need not look any
further than their office doors to
ﬁndincompetence. But with this
brilliant idea to clamp down on stu-
dent media I ﬁnd myself proved

-. wrong, and‘ shown to be the

childish, imniature, blunderous per-
son with ill conceived values that
the administration implies I am.
Without this proposal, I might in
the future vote for an editor who
can spell, or for an account ex-
ecutive who can add and subtract.‘

And heaven forbid, without this

proposal, I might have encouraged
some of my younger friends to con-
sider the University of Pittsburgh as
a college choice, .- or" become a
member of an alumni association.
That would have been a terrible
misapplication of judgment, akin to

_my past arbitrary . and ninnyish

votes in ‘Pitt News elections. _

Letter .

Student Health Service

I am writing in response to The
Pitt News editorial of March 24
which addressed itself to the pro-
posed Student Health Service fee in-
crease.

The opinion i made several
misleading statements. The first of
these was in reference to complaints
by students with regards _to no
weekend office hours. I’.m_not sure
how anyone can state that the
absence of weekend hours is “a ma-

jor question on the minds of

many.”- The Stude'ntlHealth Ad-
visory Board has been monitoring
student grievances with Student
Health via a waiting room compla-
int box for more than one year.
Although I am sure this does con-
cern a few silent students, we have

, never had one complaint about -the

services’ office hours. If you were
to ask the Student body, .1 am sure
you would find. a majority are op-
posed to the weekend hours because
of the additional cost that would be
incurred. '
would not be happy about paying

' the extra money needed to have the
.service open on the weekend when

they are not on campus to take ad-
vantage of the situation. You may
find.a handful of students “eternal-
ly grateful” as they leave the Health

Commuting students _

Service after a weekend appoint-
ment, but how grateful will-these
students be when they see their
health fee increasing in leaps and

bounds? _ _
The editorial also questioned the

mere existance of the Health Service
in light of the- fact that ‘Pitt is
located adjacent to a major health
complex. It was stated that there is
a duplication of services and it is
easier and more convenient to go to
the hospital and have the visit
covered by individual hospitaliza-
tion plans. . ‘ -

The hospitals are acute care and
emergency care facilities, the Stu-
dent Health Service is a_ primary
care facility. The hospitals are not
prepared to practice primary care
and the Health Service is not equip-
ped to provide acute or. emergency
care. In addition to general
medicine, inte”rnal,,medicine and
gynecology which can be obtained

.at the hospital on an emergency or
in-patient basis only, the Health ‘
"Service

provide other primary care
facilities, these being the private
doctors offices. Any student
visiting these doctors will learn
rather quickly that not only are
there few with weekend office
hours, but most hospitalization
plans will not cover the visits. One
bout with the flu could prove very
expensive if the private doctor is
your only‘ alternative.

would be filtered into the communi-

No one welcomes afee increase
of any kind. But there are times
when an increase is the best decision
when faced with the alternative of

‘cutting services which are very

much wanted and utilized by many
students. A'$22.00 Health Fee is
still far below the national average
for comparable Health Services.

TcikeFrom Poor, Give to Self

So Pitt’s media would not elect
chief officers under the new im-
proved Media and Publications
Board. This strengthened and ex-
panded administrative organ would
have budgetary and editorial veto
power over The Pitt News,
Backspace magazine, the Owl year-
book and WPGH. The revamping
of the Media and Publications

‘Chard occurred at the same time as
the “Student” Government Board
decided to hike activity fees, in the
same piece of legislation "so-to-.
speak. Again, it’s the same old '
story: Pitt robs more from the poor
and gives to itself, A

Student activists connected with .
these media groups are rightly upset
over Pitt’s plan to take more con-
trol over the day-to-day operations
of these groups. Pitt functionary
Andy Smith claims this is necessary
to promote ,“healthy functioning”
and to provide an ‘-‘educational ex-
perience’’ for the students. But,
just as when Pitt moved in to clamp
down on dorm _students in the name
of “campus security,” Smith has
not provided any facts which prove '
that more administrative control
leads to ‘the creation of healthy,
educational media for Pitt students.

In the same light, I hope that the
student activists in the media
groups * don’:t make the same
mistakes the RSA and the dorm
students made in protesting increas-
ed administrative control over
housing regulations. Look at what
happened: In February the RSA
came out protestingagainst Pitts
violation of their individual rights, ‘
but they failed to confront" Pitt on
the issue of rape prevention. They‘
fought against Pitt’s moves against
student rights, but they _failed to
fight for a positive solution -to- a
very real problem. This one-sided ’
method allowed Pitt to side-step
both issues. Pitt went ahead" and
locked up students ﬁve daysa week ~
instead of seven, ‘and, of course, did
nothing to protect students.

The media groups are now in a '
similar situation. They can protest
all they want against Pitt’s denial of
their rights, but unless this “protest -
against” is tied to a “solution for”
the real problems of students they
may as well save their breath. Until
now Pitt has trusted a “small circle
of friends” to control the process of
making poetry obscure, and weak,
making news obscure and weak,

‘printing yearbooks, and 4 playing

Bruce Springsteen records. Pitt
functionaries now want to assume
control themselves. Now students
will receive “professional” obscur-
ity and weakness, but they pay the
bill either way. Student media ac-
tivists will oppose tighter ad-
ministrative’ control by crying out
for looser administrative control.
All well and good, but not of much‘ -
interest to the masses of students
who have real problems to be ad-

’ dressed.

Off hand, I’d say that ninety-
eight percent of the students on this
campus write poetry, yet Backspace
manages only a scattered poetry
reading and one or two glossy issues
a year. Pitt functionaries will blame
the “small circle of friends” who
run Backspace and push adminis-
trative control under the cover of

. “professionalism.” But if there is

L

little student interest in creative
writing, we must lay the blame‘
squarely on the administration. If
an English writing major must
repeat English writing 121 four or
five times instead of moving on to

’°’ higher level classes that are not of-

fered because of budget slashing,
we must blame the administration
for discouraging student interest in

/.

creative writing, not Backspace.
Likewise, if there are few student

journalists, we must blame Pitt,.

because it,is Pitt that does not. offer
a degree in journalism.

The real problems of students
begin with housing, enrollments,
the slow quickening destruction of
CAS, and extend to threat of world
war and certain unemployment, It
may seem likefa philosophical ques-
tion, but what’are""rights for? In
taking a stand for their rights, stu-

dent activists must not forget that
“their rights” are really’ human
rights. Students have a,hu_man right
to be informed and creative people.

“lf"student activists are really going

to defend human rights on this cam-

pus, they will have to demonstrate ‘

some commitment to the real prob-
lems of students. That's what
rights are for.

FIVE YEARS AGO.

A Pitt News editorial suggested moving to Mexico as a way to“deal
with the “Impending New Ice Age”. . .everyone could_be cliff diving

and. drinking margaritas. . .the Pitt baseball team was upset at the

lack of games scheduled for the season. . .“eighteen measly games is
noxindication of what a player can do” said the coach. ‘

TENT YEARS AGO

The April Fools issue ran a feature on the “‘Spring Panty Riot” "
when Holland Hall residents showered undies into the qu'ad and the .

guys “fought valiantly ‘for the cloth”...also in the

Afewsi. . .Chancellor Wesley Posvar “while vacationing in Africa was   

usurped from his position in a coup d’etat led by right hand man
Jack Freeman”. ' ' - ‘ .

TWENTY YEARS Aeo

The actual fight between “a boar and dogs and the lassoing and hog-
tying of the 250 pound beast” could be viewed in a “jungle film” at
the Student Union. . .Students were packing pipes. . . with Sir Walter
Raleigh tobacco. . .Wanted were men and women to live in an ex-
perimental fallout shelter for one or two weeks. __

THIRTYYEARS AGO

April-fools were required to hunt in the Pitt News for''‘dummy '

copy” such as an ad for Noodnicks’ Escort Service (located in

Schenley Park), . .one satisified customer remarked, “I’ve never’
walked so far for so little’’. . .and try Mauchlines sure-lure, scented -
handkerchiefs—“soaked in sluphur dioxide. . .what swain’ could

resist picking his nose with this excruciatingly lovely fabric”-.

  Sidelines  
3}. MIKE DICHiARA if

, It was announced Friday night 'thatARoy Chipman, formally of
Lafayette, will take over as head basketball coach at Pitt. The an-
nouncement came approximately three weeks after the much
publicized resignation of Tim Grgurich. ,

Throughout his tenure at Pitt, Grgurich has absorbed a lot of
"criticism about his recuiting record. It is true that Sam Clancy is
the last recruit to come ‘to Pitt in the last three years who could have
been considered blue-chip material. But Grgurich was hindered by
a recruiting budget that left something to be desired and a facility
- that is sub-par, to be nice.

Grgurich has averaged 17 wins per season over the last three
years. The Panthers over that span have not been loaded with ex-
cellent talent.

The administrations had plans, more appropriately dreams, of
attracting a big-name coach after Grgurich resigned. It was also
believed that the money and support, two key words for any coach,
would suddenly appear for that new coach. At least the ad-
ministration realized that to get a big-name coach would require a
big ‘commitment to basketball. But then why couldn’t that com-
mitment be made to Grgurich? It’s a sure bet that Grgurich could
turn the program around as successfully as any other coach.

Roy Chipman has an outstanding record at Lafayette‘ and
Lafayette is Division I. But Division I and Division II are separated
by a thin line. Lafayette is very close to that dividing line.

-It had been widely known that Jim Valvano of Iona was looking
for employment elsewhere. He recently signed as head‘ coach at
North Carolina State. Why didn’t he consider the job at Pitt?
Because the offer was never made. Iona, although a very small
school, owns excellent basketball program. Valvano is the man
responsible for Iona’s success. First, he had support, and second
was able to pluck outmany New York City players. If Pitt honestly

; felt that Grgurich wasn’t the man forthem, why wasn’t.Valvano
offered the job. He would seem to be more qualified for’ the job

than Chipman. There seems to be a big discrepancy here.

, Players made it clear that they wanted Grgurich back as head
coach.‘ The player-coach relationship that existed was a close-knit
one. A winning and successful team needs this. A r

/

' Roy Chipman’s record or ability is not a question. What is at

to match football. By offering a relatively small-time coach the ex-
act things Grgurich wanted shows a bit of conflict.’

The players have stated that it would be difficult to play for
another coach. Clancy has been quoted as saying, “There will

afterit was clear that Grgurich would not return. Remember, he

' i , ,played three years itfbasketball, ample time to decide that his ‘.‘best

chances” are ‘on the gridiron. ' A
, Perhaps the biggest loss throughout this entire situation is the
recruiting for next year. Three weeksis a long time and both Du-
quesne and Penn State have announced the signings of quality
recruits. Pitt’s basketball program during that same time prob-
ably looked like many roads in,Pittsburgh, rough and full of holes.
That disarray is the worst condition under which to recruit blue-
chippers. , -
Chipman is the coach, however, so hopefully the issue will begin
to subside and Pitt can get to the business at hand: recruiting.
There are still some quality players around for the picking who cold
help the Panthers for next season. It will be a tough job _to get them

season may well be just a transition year._

question is whether the administration wants a winning program, '

never be another Tim Grgurich.” And it isrparticularly interesting '
' how Clancy decided to “devote himself to playing football” only .

' to come here. Pitt has been tarnished during this episode so" next

who was seeded 22nd, placed 12th

in the 200-meter backstroke event,
while diver Scott Winkler despite
his best place ever, narrowly missed
becoming.all-America by five and
one-half points.

“Rick just hasn’t regained lIlS

Fred Lewis. “He swam extremely

town for this meet. We hoped for

more but were extremely satisfied,

with the results. Our boys
represented our school extremely
well.”

A comparison of the two divi-
sions is a prime .example of how
competitive the meet really was.

Last year’s championship division
times were just good enough to
qualify for this year’s consolation
division. Numerous records were
broken, although many former
"champions failed to qualify for the
Olympic trials

This year, the atmosphere left a
lot to be desired also. Petitions and

resolutions were being stated to pre- V

sent to President Carter concerning
the Olympic boycott.

“lt sort of took something out of

the atmosphere,” said Lewis refer--

ring to the anti-boycott sentiment.
“Nonetheless, it was a superguality
meet.”

Greg Louganis, a silver medalist
from the 1976 Olympics, returned

diving competition, as expected.

“I’m happy and excited about
qualifying,” said Swanson. “Yet,
I’m disappointed with my time. I
cold have done better. I’m just glad
I made the best 12 though.
Everyone swam great.”

Swanson will take a couple of
weeks off from the pool before he
begins to train for the Olympic
trials which will be held in Austin,
Texas in June. In the meantime,
the outlook at the present moment
is bleak for the U.S. to participate

BRADENTON, Fla.—Willie
Stargell’s first-inning single with two
men on base produced the winning
runs in the Pittsburgh Pirates’ 4-1
victory over the Philadelphia Phillies

H _ in exhibition baseball yesterday.

The game was stopped by rain
after 5‘/2 innings.

Pirate starter John Candelaria
gave up two hits including a fifth-
inning solo home run by Ramon
Aviles. He got his first win of the pre-
season. Dick Ruthven lost his first.

Tim'Fo1i singled and Dave Parker

doubledebefore Stargell cracked his
single. Candelaria added an in-
surance run in the second when he
singled to score Bill Madlock from
second base.

Pittsburgh scored ‘again in the
third, when Parker singled and ad-
vanced on sin‘gles«by Stargell and
Madlock. '1

Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Don
Robinson, concerned about pain in
his pitching arm, may return to Pitts-
burgh for treatment. ' '

,“.Right now, I can’t throw,” said
Robinson, who was the National

../

League Rookie Pitcher of the Year

in'1978. “I’m going to rest the arm ~

until Monday and try again. If there
is still pain, I’ll go to Pittsburgh and
have it looked at.”‘ ‘ 
Robinson has pitched three times
for the world champion Pirates in
spring training. '
“The second time I pitched my
arm“ was fine for two innings and
then it started hurting again,” said
Robinson, 22. /

“I waited eight days before pitch- ‘L

ing again because I'had muscle
spasms in my back. The first inning I

felt real good. Then the pain came
back in the second and third.”
Robinson, who was 14-6 as a
rookie, slumpeifto 8-8 last season,
although he pitched well in spot
roles for the Pirates in the National
League. playoffs and the World
Series. He underwent an‘ operation

on his ailing right shoulder less than -

a week after the ﬁnal game of the
World Series.
He says the pain feels “like a

~ toothache” and is present only when ~

he is pitching.
“The pain doesn’t last as long as it
