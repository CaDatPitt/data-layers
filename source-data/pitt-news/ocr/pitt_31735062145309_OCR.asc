Pitt Panther prowls tonight. For
half-an-hour, starting at 9:15 o’clock,
the Panther will broadcast from sta-
-tion WWSVV a program replete with
variety and novelty. This marks its
‘ﬁrst appearance on the radio since
‘last spring, and according to Morton
‘Harris, director, “It will be some-
thing worth listening to.” A regular
program has been arranged for every
‘Tuesday at the same hour,

Music, humor, something for the
ladies, a news broadcast, and a fea-
ture interview are all scheduled for
the thirty-minute program. Nearly
twenty-ﬁve students are expected to
participate.

The highlights of the evening will
-be a special interview of two out-
standing football players in Satur-
day's game. Their names will be
sprung somewhat as a surprise, but
what they have to say will “undoubt-
edly be good.” Hry Cohen, the Pm
News Campus Scout, will conduct the
interview.

Lucius R. I-iassenpiug, Panther's
man about the campus, will introduce
himself in a ﬂurry of wit. A campaign
is to be started to make Hassenplug
-the brain-child of the Panther editor,
the by-word of every campus organi-
zation and every student on the cam-

pus.

Israel Goldberg, 036, will broadcast
as the “Pitt News Reeler." His will
be a discussion of activities and pro-
grams as written in today's News.
Sally Sanderson will conduct a “to
the women” department; Bill Murchi-
son will -offer piano selections. *

Members of the band are to play
musical interludes—among them the
new Pitt Victory Song. Arthur Bat-
taligni, BA34, is concert-master.

is based on the following criteria:
superior intelligence rating, better
scholarship average in all subjects,

superior scholarship in the subject of
major interest in which the student!
will do practice teaching, a satisfac-l
tory health rating, special ability in,
preliminary professional education
courses and the satisfactory results

Book Store Rates Most
Seasonal Business
As Rush Ends

The man who has handled more
books than any other person on
the campus leaned back against
the wall and meditated. He was
sitting on a soapbox chair in the
University book store and looked
completely worn out, He smiled
wryly as he gave the ﬁgures of
the last two week’s book store
business, a total of $30,000 in
books alone.

The average price of each book
was quoted by William F. Lenz,
manager of the store, as $2. That
means approximately 15,000 books
were sold by the University store
during the ﬁrst two weeks of
school. This does not include
the two or three hundred second
hand books sold for students at
their own prices.

Six extra employees were en-
gaged in accordance with the
NRA to handle this rush, a rush
which characterized the most_sea

Debaters Plan
Extended Tours

Tryouts Scheduled For Thursday; _
Subject On “Bank Guarantee” '

 

 

 

Withm a budget so reduced that au-
tomobiles must be used on all major
trips, the Men's Debating association,
managed by Saul Shapira, C34, is
planning ﬁve tours during the year.

The ﬁrst trip, to be taken during
the mid-semester interval, will extend
as far west as Chicago, and will in-
clude schools in Ohio, Indiana, and
perhaps Michigan. At the Easter
recess, another lengthy jaunt will
take two men -to New York——Git—y,~-with
stops tentatively planned at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, Rutgers and
Princeton.

At a date so far not determined, a
third group from the association will
Visit \Vashington, D. C., with other‘
week-end trips to West Virginia and
Buffalo also planned. Besides the
contests away from home, many local
debates will be scheduled. Arrange-
ments are being made by Shapira
and assistant managers, Edwin Banks,

35, and Israel Goldberg, C36.

Tryout for the association will take
place Thursday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock, in room 220 Alumni Hall.
Trials will be based upon the deliv-
ery of ﬁve-minute discussions on the
question: Guarantee of Bank Depos-
its. The tryouts will be under the
supervision of the debating coaches,
Dr. W. M. Parrish and Richard
Murphy.

Betty Quarrie, Carl; Swartz Get H
Leads In “The Queens Husband”

Eleven Of Fifteen Roles
Filled In Tryouts
By Friday

 

By Charles Foreman

Tryouts ended on Friday for Pitt
Players’ ﬁrst production of the year,
“The Queen's Husband,” and Carl B.
Cass, director, immediatey selected
players for all but four of the ﬁfteen
available roles.

The queen’s husband, who, as you
may have surmised, is
King Eric VIII, to be exact, will be
played by Carl Swartz, C34, president
of Pitt Players. Swartz is beginning
his ﬁnal year as an actor of leading
roles both in the Players’ and in Cap
and Gown shows. His domineering
wife, Queen Martha, who wears the
royal trousers, is Betty Quarrie, C34,
who also is climaxing her dramatic
activity at Pitt. The king and queen

the king, -

parts were created at the Playhouse
Theater, New York, in 1928, by the
well-known Roland-Young and Gladys
Hanson. ,7

Princess Anne, democratic, young,
beautiful, is in lov,‘ with her father's
secretary, Frederik Granton, and
thereby supplies many of the plot’s
complications. Anne is played by
Elizabeth Black, 036, whose selection
is unprecedented er having joined
Pitt Players only, one week ago.
Granton has not t been chosen.

The politically, aspiring villain,
General Northrup; a ponderous, in-
domitable man of faction, is Herbert
Fine, M34; and "rd Birten, an un-
scrupulous diplomtist who arranges
a political marriage of Princess Anne
to a foreign prinde without either’s
consent, is N-athaniE1-baum, C35. The
prince, who has ot yet been cast,
as heartily dislike I Anne as Granton
loves her. For Aﬁne, the play is a
three-act bout of} Politics versus
Love, with a surpxfise endng.

Sherwood Piece First
Played In New York
Five Years Ago

-Phipps, the comical, checkerplay-
ing footman, is Louis Reizenstein,‘
C35; and Major Blent, His Majesty’s
“old faithful," is George Strong,
Ed36.

The parts of two soldiers will be
played by Nile Faust, Ed35, and John
Hesselbein, BA35. Ladies in waiting
to the queen are-Jeanne Osborn, C36,
and Louise Misko, Ed36. Fellman and
Laker, two revolutionary liberals, are
yet to be cast.

“The Queen's Husband” is a costume
comedy by Robert Emmet, Sherwood
laid in a mythical European king-
dom. The production date has not
been deﬁnitely set but will fall some-
where in late November, ’

Inquiry Learns
Of Mine Strikes

Economics Professor Analyzes
Critical Events Tomorrow

 

 

The why of the “rank and ﬁle”

strike among the miners in the captive -

mines of the soft coal regions in de-
ﬁance of the wishes of President
Roosevelt, the NRA, and President
Lewis of the United Mine Workers
Union, will be analyzed by Dr. Carroll
R. Daugherty, assistant professor of
economics tomorrow afternoon at
12:30 o’clock in 107 Alumni hall at
the regular Inquiry club meeting.

Dr. Daugherty’s analysis will be
based on two points, one, the nature

of the miners and the other,_ thecon-a

dition of the industry.

On the nature of the miners Dr.
Daugherty will discuss their tradi-
tions, their present environment, and
the peculiarities of their work.

Concerning the conditions of the
industry Daugherty will give the
economic background of the case,
out throat competition, the high cost
of labor and the inevitable results of
the latter two factors, wage cuts.
Emphasis will be placed on the pres-
ent situation of the “captive mines”
of Fayette county owned by steel
companies and public utilities, in the
discussion.

“A Subtle Emanation”
By Saul Weisberg

The opinions expressedlin this column are the
personal views of the writer and are not to be taken
as the editorial policy of the Pitt News.

W0 YEARS AGO, AS A sophomore, I was quite a

virulent young radical. in those days, and they aren't
very far away either, I moved about in a crowd of com-
paratively vicious Socialists and Communists, denounc-
ing almost everything except Russia and disagreeing
with everybody except those ﬁrst agreeing with me. I
came very close to editing a wild little bulletin attack-
ing the school authorities and delivered terribly serious
speeches to the delegates at a mock political conven-
tion. At my peak, I even gave a weakly encouraging talk
to a group of “reds” at a Workers’ school.

As I passed out of my second college year, however,
I also found myself passing out of my pseudo-active
radicalism and moving into a sophisticated boredom, a
tiredness of engaging in sloppy efforts to change a badly
constructed society. I had no right to be tired, I had
never done anything in particular to make me tired,
but I was, and what can you do about it?

ATELY I HAVE been thinking these things over and

I believe that I am swinging back towards my soph-
omore phase. I ﬁnd that I do not want to be just a
bourgeois intellectual. It is certainly not very satisfy-
ing, not conducive to moments of uplift, such as I occa-
sionally experienced two years ago. Rarely have I been
so morally raised as when that group of battered and
bruised miners in the Workers’ school applauded my
poor stumbling words about faith in a new society. And
I have always been secretly very proud of myself for
bellowing out for free speech in an Inquiry Club meet-
ing and getting away with it, too.

And I feel sure again that there is as much glory in
ﬁghting the forces of reaction as in struggling with the
forces of darkness. I appreciate again all the pleasure
that the social reformer may get in ﬁghting war and
Fascism and all the other low and mean movements in
the world today. To me, as to the social reformer, the
prevention of sadness and misery and starvation appears
something worth working for. But in this I seem to
differ from most students. who, as we can see, take
little interest in looking forward, in aiding liberalism
and radicalism. They show no inkling of concern over
matters that appear to me and to many others to be of
importance, changes that could be made in our society
if they, the students, rose up and fought.

OR I BELIEVE implicitly that there is a. real pos-

sibility of a society being so constructed that we all
may have a share of its beneﬁts and an equality in its
freedom. I see no intolerable reason why we should
have war and sweat shops and brutal policemen hitting
Communists, far more intelligent, over the head with 8.
leaded mace. I see no reason why we should have any
of the things that make our world so ugly and so nasty,
no reason except that we are controlled by men with no
social vision and no education.

And if students would read and learn and investigate,
they, too, might come to my belief and join in an eﬁort
to make our society a better one. For who knows but
that the student, if organized, might well be able to re-
sist successfully the onrush of war which threatens to
maim or kill everyone of us who is sound of limb and
ﬁrm of body. And who knows but that the student, if
organized, might well be able to prevent the oncome of
Fascism, with its burial of civil rights, its degradation
of the worker, and its almost unnoticed crushing of the
new privileges of women. Certainly, it’s about time the
student tried.

Esquire, a man's magazine for men, coming out

Between

You, Me
And The

Lamp Post

By Wilbur Clark
The Perfect Critic; A Rhapsody in
Reflections.
Characters: Norman, tall, dark,

serious, and aﬁre with the desire to
write something “really good;” Anna
Mae, petite, blonde, and oh so very
helpful.

Setting: The davenport at Anna
Mae’s faces the ﬁreplace where burn-
ing pine logs furnish the only illu-
mination and ﬁll the room with danc-
ing shadows. The ﬁrelight is mir-
rored by the shade of a brass lamp
on an end table and by a black leather
cushion on the ﬂoor between the ﬁre
and the davenport. Wind and snow
beat against a window center back.

Anna Mae is sitting on her foot at
the far end of the davenport, swing-

when the curtain goes up, Reﬂections
of the ﬁre ricochet off her hose and
into her hair where they glow. Save
for her leg, the dancing ﬂames, and
the shifting shadows, there is no
action for several minutes. Then the
door bell rings. She jumps up, over
the cushion, and opens the door.
Wind, snow, and Norman blow in.

Norman, taking off his coat and
tossing it on a chair by the door:
“Wow but it's cold out! Wouldn’t go
out anywhere tonight—except here,”
and he smiles.

Anna Mae: “Did you bring it?
Come, here, sit and toast yourself. I
ﬁxed the ﬁre just before you came.”
She sits, folds her hands-between her
knees and leans back, stretching her
arms.

Norman, sits down and snaps on
the lamp at his shoulder: “Yep, here
it is, I’m anxious to see what you
think of it. I changed the ending a.
bit; it makes the point clearer, I
think.” He reaches in an inside
pocket and pulls out several sheets
of folded manuscript. “Here, I’ll read
it to you.” He adjusts the lamp
shade. “Gee, Anna Mac, I don’t know
what I’d do if it wasn't for your criti-
cisms of my papers.”

She laughs. “Oh if it wasn't me, it
would be someone else.”

“No it wouldn’t either. You’re dif-
ferent. When I come over, like this,
it's not like a date. I’m not expected

. that is . . well . . . you’re
just a perfect critic, that’s it.” And
she, of course, blushes in apprecia-
tion of the compliment.

She settles back on the cushions in
the corner of the davenport, draws one
leg in under her, swings the other,
and the ﬁrelight plays in her hair,

Norman reads: “It was a summer’s
evening and Dave was standing at
the washstand shaving, The wind
blew the soft curtain against his bare
arm and rustled in the trees outside.”
He stops and looks at her. “Do you
think ‘whispered’ would be too senti-
mental there?”

She hasn't been following; the play
of the ﬁrelight on his black, wavy hair
has been more ‘interesting. She
starts, then replies: “Yes, that would
be better.” -

He frowns, then-goes back to read-
ing: “The are light on the corner
sputtered, ﬂared blue, and ﬁnally
burned steadily . ., .” For some time
he reads on; she goes back to watch-
ing the ﬁrelight on his hair. Finally
she reaches over, slowly, and touches
the waves with her ﬁnger tips, gent-
ly, almost as if she expected to be
burned. Absorbed in his reading, he
doesn’t notice at ﬂrst, stirs uneasily,
stops and looks at her. She falls for-
ward, her arms around his neck. He
looks startled, then experimentally
puts his arm around her, at the same\
time calling her name softly: “Anna

ing her leg and staring into the ﬂames '

The ﬁre in her hair shifts as she
nods yes.

“Then,” he slips from under her,
lets her fall on the davenport, “It’s
lights out, ﬁnish, for us.” He turns
off the lamp, picks up the manuscript,
throws it on the ﬁre, and pausing for
a minute at the door looks back and
mutters: “Damn it! Now who's go-
ing to be my critic.” The wind
whistles and the door slams shut.

The shadows retreat to the farthest
corners of the room as the manuscript

‘ﬂares up, then almost ﬁll the room

again as the ashes stir in the draught.
The reﬂectlon of the embers on the
lamp shade, the black cushion, and
in her hair glows dully as she sobs
and the curtain comes down,

 

Copy And Cycles; A Drama
Of Fenders, Headlights,
Wrecks And Love

 

By Wilbur D. Clark

“Greater love hath no man than
this, that he give his life for a
friend.” But I say unto you that
great also is the love of a man
who will give fenders and head-
lights for a friend. Such is my
contention this autumn day, afore-
said contention arising from the
following episode:

It happened when the stream of
traffic on the boulevard was sud-
d_eI11Y _st0pped, as traffic some-
times 18. I was ﬂoating along, as
one can ﬂoat only on a, motorcycle,
with “copy” for the printer in my
pocket as a special favor to ye
Editor. Motorcycles just don’t
Stop as quickly as automobiles.
That accounts for the headlight.
The car behind a.ccounted nicely
for the fender. Nor is this the
first time it’s happened. Once
before this week it happened-
again that copy might get to the
printers on time.

Yes, I am sure of it. “Greater
love hath no man than this that
he give his fenders and head-
lights for a friend."

cover. It is a striking picture
even without the purple teeth
and mustachios that the lovely
lady displays on the sample of
the cover. That irresistible im-
pulse, you know.

Andwhile we’re on the subject
the Panther has a feature on the
“new etiquette,” which you’d bet-

even articles for the thinking
students. One gives various view-
points on “How to get on best

author must have read about
Casanova——Mae West, too), and
the other is a dry question that
won’t set the mind in a turmoil:

I Vesta,HerPriestesses,
Welcome Students
In Autumn Rite

Autumn with her colorful
leaves and harvest fruit was
formally ushered in by YWCA
and YWHA at the Hearth cere-
mony Wednesday evening. Heinz
House was decorated with the
russet leaves typical of autumn.
Gathered around the hearth, lit
by the candle light of Vesta, were
the freshman women and trans-
fers dressed in white.

Lar and Penatis introduced the
hospitality of the home of Amici-
tia. Amicus and Amica begged
Vesta a name for their unnamed
child. Finally, by general agree-
ment of Vesta and the priest-
esses, the child was called Caris-
sima. The lights came on_ The
crowd rejoiced and feasted. Fa-
tigued by feasting, Lar and
Penatis bade good-night to all.

The Hearth ceremony repre-
sented a symbol of the religious
activities of both YWCA and
YWHA. The purpose was to bring
the freshman women and "trans-
fers in closer relationship with
both organizations. The sketch
was written by Thyrsa W. Amos,
dean of women, with the as-
sistance of Margaret Doescher,
C35, and Adele Ash, C35_

Owl Photographer Offers
Senior Girls Three
Extra Negatives

-:—

 

By Florence Fisher Parry

Girls!

Seniors!

I was just thinking there may be
some of you girls—and even boys-
who, when you get your Owl personal
pictures made at The Parry Studio,
might care to have EXTRA Nega-

tives taken, in addition to the three
allowed in each “OWL” sitting, Many
girls like to have a change of costume
—I mean, the dresses they wear in
their Owl pictures aren't quite the
ones they would want to have on in
pictures they’d be giving their boy
friends.

To take care of this diﬁiculty, I
have decided to make it possible for
you to have what we shall call a
“double” sitting; that is, three nega-
tive in the dress for the Owl picture,
and three Extra negative in Another
dress. But in case you do this, you
will pay the Parry Studio one dollar
to cover the cost of the additional
negatives. This is not refunded, nor
does it apply on any order placed.
But where a. dozen or more pictures
are ordered, you may have a choice of
two of the negatives, with no extra
charge. (Of course for the regular
Owl negatives there is no charge at
all).

I hope this will “help out,” girls.
I want you to regard your sitting seri-
ously, and come looking as Pretty as
you can look!

that the deadline for entry blanks
has been extended from Monday un-

Track Coach Olson, sponsor of the
meet, has expressed his satisfaction
with the number of blanks turned in
thus far. “Most of these entries
come from boys who have never tried
out for a Pitt track or cross-country
team. It proves that there are many
boys who have a liking for track and
appreciate a chance to test their met-
tle against boys who are likewise in-
experienced.” 

Tomorrow afternoon’s competition
will be limited to all track events
(the dashes and distance runs), the
high jump and broad jump. The re-
mainder of the events will be run off
Friday afternoon. Activities will get
under way at 3:30 o’clock on both
days.

Gold and silver medals will be
awarded the ﬁrst and second place
winners in each event, with ribbons
going to the third-place winners.
These will be distributed at a track
and ﬁeld get-together at the Activities
building Tuesday evening, October 24.
Everyone taking part in the games is
invited to attend whether they have
been a place-winner or not. Refresh-

Pitt Psychologist Has
First Volume Printed

Dr, Norman L. Munn, assistant pro-

fessor of psychhology. ha.s just
published his ﬁrst book, “Animal
Psychology.” Reviewed in the New

York Times, Dr. Munn’s book has
been hailed as an important contri-
bution to the ﬁeld because it supplies
needed work connecting most of the
research done in this ﬁeld.

Not only does it summarize most of
the important work done on rats, but
it has enough explanatory and theo-
retical material to make it a complete
study.

Dr. Munn has been teaching here
since 1929. He graduated from Clark
university where he carried on some
important experimental research on
rats. For years he has been a regu-
lar contributor to Psychological Fo-
rum, American Journal of Psychology,
and other related magazines.

Well, the 1933 Pitt Panthers finally clicked. After looking decidedly In-

ferior to Sutherland teams of the past three years, this year’s Panther team
, became decidedly “on” and swamped the poor old Navy. The Golden Cats

That pass of Sebastian’s to O’Dell in the ﬁrst period
was reminiscent of the ones Franklin Hood threw when

here. It must have traveled at least

The Panther passing attack, as a whole, was the best
seen here since the Golden Cats of 1931 defeated Army at
the Stadium, 26 to 0.
was the fact that most of the Panther passes were thrown
to Rocker and O‘Dell instead of Skladany, when every-
body, apparently including the Navy players, was expect-
ing Skladanv to be on the receiving end.

And now all we have to do is beat Minnesota, Notre
Dame, Centre, Duquesne, Nebraska, and Carnegie Tech!

Pitt Gross-Country Team Sweeps
Westminster Meet, 40-15

The Panther cross-country team
won its first meet of the season Sat-
urday morning over the Schenley
Park f0ur~mile course, defeating a
veteran Westminster team by a per-

fect score, 40 and 15. The ﬁrst ﬁve
places, all that count in cross-country,
were taken by Panther harriers, Law-
rence, Waggonhouser, Kirkpatrick,
Musico, and Albright crossing the ﬁnal
mark in a tie. The time was 25 min-
utes and 44 seconds, good time for so
early in the season.

Sixth place in the meet was taken
by George Cook, who ﬁnished only
about ten yards behind the ﬁrst ﬁve.
This was a remarkable showing con-
sidering that Cook never took part in
any track activities before he came
to school here. Loncher and Connel-
ly, Panther harriers, ﬁnished in eighth
and ninth positions respectively.

Next week Coach Carl O1son’s har-
~ riers meet the Miami university cross-
country team, Ohio state champions.
The meet is to be run over the Schen-
ley Park course.

Season Program Planned
By University Orchestra

The University of Pittsburgh Or-
chestra will present its second an-
nual concert on April 11. Last year
the orchestra gave its ﬁrst annual
concert in the Frick Training School.
It was so successful that they are to
give another this year. The orches-
tra also plays for all Pitt Players’
productions.

At present thirty-seven members
compose the orchestra class, but po-
sitions are open to any one who plays
the violin, string bass, clarinet or
viola. Any one, however, who plays
any instrument at all is urged to
come out to rehearsal every Thurs-
day night at 7 o’clock in Room 728
Cathedral.
