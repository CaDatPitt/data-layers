Science degree from Columbia uni-
versity in 1911, the Master of Arts

in 1912, and the Doctor of Philoso- .

phy degree in 1915. His major
work was in the ﬁeld of organic
chemistry under Columbia’s Pro-
fessor Marston T. Bogert, leader
in the ﬁeld of organic chemistry.

With Dr. Wilmer Baldwin, as-
sistant professor of chemistry at
the University, Dr. Lowy was co-
author of “A Laboratory Manual
of Organic Chemistry. Dr. Lowy
was also co-author of several other
books in the ﬁeld of chemistry.

Dr. Lowy was a member of the

(Following is a tribute written
in behalf of Dr. Lowy by one of
his former students:)

“On Christmas day, after a
long illness, Professor Alexander
Lowy of the Chemistry Depart-
ment passed from this life. Yet, in
the hearts of his students, his col-

leagues, and his many friends, he

will live forever.

“For three days I stood near his
bier, and watched the long lines of
men and women, young and old,
rich and poor, ‘famous and obscure,
as they silently ﬁled by in a last
token of their respect. For over
twenty years he taught at Pitt,
instilling into all in contact with

him, his own dynamic enthusiasm, _

generosity, and friendliness.

He was a man of wide interests
and accomplishments, and in high
regard in the scientiﬁc world. He
held many patents and responsible
offices, and wrote numerous papers

Graduation

i Seniors Advanced

The war has begun to affect the Univer-
sity fundamentally.

The entire undergraduate program is be-
ing accelerated in order to meet the needs
of government and ‘industry in this time of
crisis. _.

Seniors in the undergraduate schools-—the
College, and the schools of Engineering,
Business Administration, and Education-—
will be graduated about one month ahead of
schedule.

And plans are being discussed for a 48
week school year.

The accelerated program applies to:
Seniors in the undergraduate schools———the

College, and the schools of _Engineering,

Business Administration, and Education.

Juniors, sophomores, freshmen, and pros-
pective freshmen in these schools to a degree
as yet unknown.

The accelerated program does not apply

to:

Students in the professional schools of
law, medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy.
These students will not be directly affected
in any way by the accelerated program, as
revealed so far.

Certain deﬁnite decisions have been an-
nounced by the administration.

‘These deﬁnite decisions are:
First semester:

The ﬁrst semester for those affected by
the accelerated program will close Saturday,
January 17. This is two weeks ahead of
schedule. '

Examinations: V
The separate “examination schedule and
examination week will be eliminated.

g All examinations for those affected by the
program will be given sometime during the
next two weeks. That is, anytime after stu-
dents have returned from Christmas recess
they may expect to be given ﬁnal examina-
tions.

Mid year graduation:
Mid year graduation will take place as
planned, on Friday, February 20.

This accelerated program applies only to
the undergraduate schools of the College,
Engineering, Education, and Business Admin-
istration.

Registration for second semester:
Day and evening students will register

Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, January
19, 20, 21.

Second semester:
Second semester classes in undergraduate
schools will begin on Thursday, January 22.
Recesses: ~
Spring recess has been cancelled, with the
exception of Good Friday, April 3.

End of second semester for juniors, sopho-

mores, and freshmen: ,

Juniors, sophomores, and freshmen will
continue in school after seniors have been
graduated. They will have classes until the
end of May as scheduled. Thus they will not
lose “‘anyvtime‘ although: their first ,semester

 

 
   
    

will be cut short. This can easily be made up
during the second semester. School will not
close for juniors, sophomores and freshmen
at the end of April as it will for seniors.

Certain indeﬁnite and as yet undecided
plans have been discussed.

The indeﬁnite and undecided plans are:

Graduation of seniors:

Seniors will probably be graduated at the
end of April, or the beginning of May. The
date has not yet been set, and probably will
not be deﬁnite for at least two more Weeks?

48 week school year:

The undergraduate schools may adopt a‘ A

16 Week term of three terms a year begin-
ning this summer. However this has only

been discussed, and since it involves a tre-

mendous change and a revolution in tradi-
tional American university life, no prelimi-
nary statement Will probably be issued for at
least two weeks And deﬁnite plans may not
be ﬁnished up for some time to come, al-
though,the change is probable.

University Calendar:

A meeting will be held to consider changes
in the University calendar. No changes out-
side those announced above have been made.

A

. In summing up, the proposed acceleration
in program will have the following effect
upon students:

Seniors: will have their ﬁrst semester cut
short three weeks, two weeks of which would
have been taken up with exams and regis-
tration anyway; will probably be graduated
a month earlier than expected, at the end of
April or at the beginning of May.

Jm-ziors, sophomores, and freshmen: will

have their ﬁrst semester cut short, the same-

as for seniors; but will continue in ,school un-
til the end of May, about one month after

seniors have graduated and thus make up 9

the weeks lost from the ﬁrst semester.

Graduates Working for degrees in the Col-'
lege, or the schools of Business Administra-
tion, Engineering, and Education: Willprob-
ably be given time to ﬁnish work in their
ﬁeld as of the original closing date of the
ﬁrst semester, Friday, January 30. The mid-
year graduation date stands as Friday, Feb-
ruary 20.

Students in the professional schools of
law, medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy: Will
not be affected by the accelerated program.

How activities will be affected is not gen-
erally known, but it is entirely probable that
there will be some shifts:

The 1942 Owl is now scheduled to come
out the week of April 20. Therefore all pho-
tography will have to be in by February 20.
This means that there will be no resched-
uling of group pictures, and that activities
taking place in March, April, and May will
have advanced pictures taken.

Cap & Gown club was scheduled to hold a
meeting last week end, the probable outcome
of which will be the cancellation of the show
due to the emergency and due to lack of
funds. The Cap & Gown show was to be held

the Week of April 20, and if it is held this

year the date will probably be advanced.

Men's Council Book store, for buying  
selling used text books, will probably func--”
tion during the Week of January 19, and if

     

perhaps into the week of January 26.. l.

 H The T.r-iemesterl Plan 

Theigovernment does not believe, ‘as it _did during
the last war, in mustering every college student it
can into_ the army. » V - ‘ v

The government does believe that we are in for a
long war, and it believes that production will win
the war. And to get the men necessary for planning,
increasing, and managing ‘production, the govern-
me.nt is aasking-——real1y commanding—th_e universi-
ties to produce good engineers, scientists, and busi-
ness management men as quickly as possible.

_The government has suggested a 48 week school
year, with school running right through the sum-
mer months. These 48 weeks can be divided into
three terms of ,i16 weeks each. Or. they maybe di-
vided into four terms‘ of '12 weeks each.‘

Some colleges already run on a three: term school
year, and they will probably change to ..a four term

._The University, however, will probably adopt the
three term-or trimester—system,,of three 16, week

,.

This means that juniors, sophomores, freshmen,
and prospective freshmen (may cut from four to 16
months from their regular four-year grind, if they
do not take any summer vacation. - '

If the trimester plan is adopted, and if students _

attend school the summer of 1942, present juniors

can cut four months off their four years, present
sophomores can cut eight months, present freshmen
12 months, and prospective freshmen (present high
school seniors) 16 months. ’ .

’ Doctor Carlson’s baske.tball
quintet returns , to school today
._after the.Christmas recess ﬁnding
themselves in the same predica-
ment _as weretheir football breth-
ren last fall. It seems as though
all the Pitt athletic teams have
something in common whe-n they
engage a" school from the mid-
west or the ‘Big Ten, and that is
they always ‘lose. '

This year the Panthermen's an-

"nual Christmas jaunt through the

mid-west was cut to two games,_
fortunately for the local fans, and
as a result the Blue and Gold lost
only two ‘games. I A ‘
Sophomore Otto Graham led the
Northwestern onslaught on the
Panthers in the opening contest
whenhe c-ontributed 22 points to

the Wildcats’ cause. The North-

western cagers were not pressed
throughout’ the game,
going away. After the game,

The one-handed stars from Indi-
ana threw in points from every an-
gle.of the floor," and handed Pitt
their third straight setback. Still

Carlson said his team’s shots. "just.

didn't drop through. the hoop."

Pitt’s ﬁrst victory came when
the Big Red of Cornell came to
town with the orthodox Eastern
style of ball playing. The local
shots, fell through the basket, par-
ticularly" Ziolkowski’s and Loh-
meyer’s, and the Panthers got ice-
