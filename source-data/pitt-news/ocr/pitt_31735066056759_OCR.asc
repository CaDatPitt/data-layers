Tom Murphy Wins mayoral race by landslide

Plans to overhaul
Pittsburgh’s city government
will soon be underway as
democrat Tom Murphy
becomes Pittsburgh’s 55th
mayor. '

As expected, Murphy won
a landslide victory over
his three rivals. Taking 66
percent of the vote, Murphy
has plans to improve the
financial status of the city and

improve the safety of the
streets.

“We have to recognize that
this is not the cops
and robbers of the 50’s any-
more,” Murphy-said at a Pitt
student forum earlier this
month.

Murphy said he wants the
city’s public safety services
reorganized. A

To address financial’ needs

 

According to Sue McCann RN, coordi-

of the city, Murphy said he
wants the state legislature to
approve a 1 percent county-
wide sales tax with a portion
of the revenue‘ going directly
to the city.

But he said he also wants
to improve the existing finan-
cial structures of the city as
well. J,

“The third-largest bank
in Pennsylvania is right here

 

in Pittsburgh  We need
to pay attention to that
apple,” Murphy said at the
forum.

With 57,172 votes,
Murphy’s strong majority eas-
ily knocked out the other
three candidates. Indepen-
dent Duane Darkins finished
a distantsecond with 15 per-
cent of the vote (13,271

For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center’s department of dermatology has
._been chosen as one of 14 sites across the
country to participate in a nationwide
study of_ “hard skin,” a condition often
similar to arthritis.

nator of the study, scleroderma, meaning
“hard skin,” is an autoimmune dis-
order in which the body’s immune
system attacks its own connective tis-
sues.

This attack leads to the overproduc-
tion of collagen, causing thickening and
scarring of tissues. The disease affects

nal organs.

The Food and Drug Administration
approved a study that will look at photo-
pheresis for the treatment of scleroder-
fna_ .

“The affected tissue can be found in_
"two forms, localized and widespread,”

Bright spots
in future for
republicans,
students say

By Randy Knapick »
Staff Writer

Few Republican candidates were
elected to office in yesterday’s elec-
tion, as might be expected in a
region as heavily democratic as
Pittsburgh. 2

The election did show some
promising signs, however, accord-
ing to College Republicans
President Eric Lurie. ‘

“There were definitely some
bright spots in the election,” he
said. H

Lurie noted the difficulty encoun-
tered by republican candidates
who seek election in Pittsburgh
because the majority of voters in
the city are registered democrats.

“A few races were a little disap-
pointing,” Lurie said. “We are not
thrilled, but we are keeping our
chins up.” ' (

“Its very tough to try to‘ take over
a position in Pittsburgh where
you’re so underfavored,” said Jim
Everlof, treasurer of the College
Republicans. '

Kathy Matta, republican Candi»
date for mayor of the city of
Pittsburgh, _ lost to’, democratic Tom
Murphy, who was strongly favored
coming into the election.

Matta won 14 percent of the vote
(12,058), placing third behind win-
ner Tom Murphy (66 percent,
57,172) and second—place finisher
Duane Darkins (15 percent
13,271)., according to KDKA. J

“It’s not really a surprise,” said
Everlof. “She was such an under-
dog, but she did pretty well.”

Matta promised to run for elec-
tion again in 1997.

Though this year’s election was
not exceptionally productive, the
Republican Party is looking ahead
to the larger Pennsylvania governor
race in 1994, according to Lurie.

1 ‘‘We’re looking forward to the
governor’s race which we will
take,” Lurie said.

Tenure Violations need to be addressed, Assembly says

By Michael Henderson

‘ and Monika Colbert

The Pitt News

The Faculty Assembly unani-
mously agreed that tenure viola-
tions are a prevalent concern at
Pitt and need to be addressed.

“Blatant attack on tenure is
absolutely unacceptable,”
Faculty Assembly President
James Holland said, about the

issue of tenure violations con-

cerning Dr. Norman _Wo1mark
who was asked to resign from
Chief of Surgery as a result of
the Monteﬁore Hospital merger
with the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

On July 1, Montefiore
Hospital merged with UPMC.
Holland said as a result of this
merger, a $5 million fund sup-

porting research and activities '
that had been accumulated over ’

some period of time by

Wolmark and his colleagues
was removed from their control.
According to Holland,
Wolrnark’s lab space _was taken
away.
*“His staff was scared out,
bought out [and] pushed out,”
Holland said. Wolmark lost his
authority as Chief of Surgery
because of what he feels was
another physician's fault.
The physician was unquali-
ﬁed and preformed the surgery

despite Wolmark’s objections,
Holland said. The patient died,
perhaps as a result of this,
Holland said.

Holland said he wants “to
bring home the fact that a
tenured, full professor is being
wittled down and everything
around him to virtually noth-
mg.» .

The agreement presented to
Wolmark requested he relin-
quish his tenure, disassociate

himself from UPMC and turn
over his patient records to
UPMC, Holland said. This
agreement also prohibited
Wolmark from using the
University Senate Grievance
Procedure or Tenured
Academic Freedom Procedure.
In consideration for this he
would receive nine months pay,
according to Holland.

Newspaper
gives law 0
students an
open forum

By Jennifer Vernet
For The Pitt News

Aiming to provide a
voice for law students, a
newspaper will serve as
an open forum for opin-
ion and debate. '

, The Pitt Law Record,
which made its debut in
September, is currently in
its third month of publica-
tion, and promises to
spark discussion among
Pitt’s law students.

Denise Lieberman, edi-
tor in chief, said the paper
started because Pitt law
students needed a better
source of infonnation and
a way to express their
opinions.

“The law school is very
small with about 750 stu-

_ dents. Things lend them-
selves to rumor and the
important things get lost
in the shuffle,” Lieberman
said. “The newspaper
provides a method of dis-
seminating information
and opinions through the
law school community.”

In addition to regular
news coverage, The Pitt
Law Record features an
article called “The
Adversarial Process.” The
page-long article high-
lights a certain controver-
sial subject, and two writ-
ers discuss their opposing
views. In the past, writers
hashed out their differ-
ences on issues such as
President __Clinton’s health
care reforms and gays in
the military.

Lieberman said while
the p'aper covers news ,
that is important to law
students, the primary goal.
of the paper is to provide
a forum for opinions and

“ debates.’ - T-

“We don’t cover the
issues simply because

. _they’re law-related. Law
permeates many other
aspects of life, and it's
easy for law students to
forget about the outside
wo1‘ld,” she said. “We
want to pull the outside
world and the law com-
munity together through
debate and opinion. We
want to open communica-
tion.” ’_

, Lieberman _ said
although The Pitt Law
Record has a circulation of
2,000, it is not in competi-
tion with The Pitt News.

“Students read [it] in
addition to The Pitt News.
It gives them something a
general paper can’t,” she
said. “We focus on indi-
vidual students and very
specific legal issues. Who
else would want to read
about that ”

Liebennan said The Pitt
Law Record succeeds the

UPM C receives grant for depression research

By Amy Fink
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center has received a
one-year grant for $55,600 from
the Jewish
Foundation to support an activi-
ties program that will be imple-
mented for the senior citizens to
decrease symptoms of depres-
sion.

According to Jules Rosen,
M.D., principal investigator of
the project, there is a full spec-

trum of nursing home patients"

that are depressed. The
patients profoundly depressed
are easily recognized because
they stop eating and sleeping
and they lose their will to live.
However, there is another layer
of patients that are less
depressed, but still far from
their potential of learning.
Rosen said these are ‘the
groups of patients that the pro-
gram will deal with. “This, lesser
depression may be related to

Healthcare '

some of the losses oftheir
homes, spouses or autonomy.
There may be a reasonable
reaction to these stresses. We
are trying to identify the moods
of nursing home patients.”
Patients may not necessarily
be predominantly sad, they may
be predominantly apathetic.
Rosen said this program was to
introduce “a psychosocial inter-
vention, that is personalize and
emphasize elements of main-
taining control over one’slife.”
A typical nursing home pro-
gram has certain planned activi-
ties, but the patients that experi-
ence depression may not want
to participate, Rosen said.‘ The
goal is to get the patient
involved with an area of interest
such as photography, music,
religion, animals, etc. This gives
the patient an opportunity to
choose

request. “We are trying to iden-
tify people with a specific type
of depression, and seeing if this
treatment paradigm will reduce

an activity upon‘

their symptoms,” Rosen said.

The grant will also support
some research equipment and a
research nurse, to identify
depressed patients by rating
scales to assess the patients’
thinking, mood and interest,
and how they get along with
others. The second person will
be a trained occupational thera-
pist. Dr. Joan Rogers, co-princi-
ple investigator, will supervise
to maintain structure.

Once the people are identified
with this less severe depression,
they will be divided into two
groups. Half will be placed into
the activities program while the
other group will undergo the
regular schedule for a two-
month period. The groups will
switch and the results will be
analyzed.

The research" will predict if "a
particular area of interestwill

' encourage patients to take con-

trol again of their emotional and
physical well-being. Rosen said,
“Research done in Pittsburgh,

by Dr. Richard Schultz showed
that the element of control over
one’s time and activities are
essential to a sense of well-
being in nursing home
patients.”

Patients and their families will
beinterviewed to determine a
particular area of interest.
Activities designed for the
patients are expected to
improve their psychological and
medical treatments. “This truly
is a research project with very
little risk, no medication side
effects,” he said. J

The Jewish Healthcare
Foundation balances their
investments in three categories
— elderly, children and youth
and women’s health. Senior
program officer Jim Denova
said, “These three issue areas
are the most significant in
improving systems of care, and
Jewish seniors are a paramount
concern in direct research and
services as well as long—term
systems and programs.”

University of Pittsburgh has already

started campaigning for United Way

By Sara Zeno
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh community has
begun contributing to this 'year’s United Way
campaign.

The United Way is an agency that di-
stributes contributions to various health
and human service programs in Allegheny
County. _ .

Those who contribute are given the oppor-
tunity to choose "specific programs where they
would like their money used.

Some of these choices include teen-parent-
ing programs, shelter and counseling-for
victims of domestic violence, mental
health programs and employment-training
programs. ’

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs William
Harmon has been the University of
Pittsl)urgh’s United Way campaign manager
for the past three years.

“Once you look at the economy, the
increased need and the increased number of
the homeless, it highlights the importance of

contributing what you can to others,” Hannon
said.

“The University of Pittsburgh, in the city of
Pittsburgh, is the largest employer.
Contributing not only to the education of
Western Pennsylvania, but providing some
financial resources that would help relieve and
resolve some of the health education prob-
lems, is a critical issue for the University of
Pittsburgh.” . ~ .

Last year, the university community raised

over $500,000 for the United Way. " .

Harmon said there is not a specific goa
amount to be raised this year; contributors give
as much as they are able.

University of Pittsburgh employees can con-
tribute a set amount from each pay, calculated
according to their salaries, he said.

Students who would like to contribute to
the United Way can pick up a cam-
paign pledge card at the Student Affairs Of-
fice, 130 in the William Pitt Union or in any
university department. For information on
volunteering for the United Way, call 456-
6861. -

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, November 3, 1993

Some students scheaale
classes aroana’ soaps

By Michael Henderson
For The Pitt News

They are steamy, sexy and
chocked full of excitement.
They are the talk of most "col-
lege campuses, including Pitt’s.
They're soap operas, and stu-
dents just can’t seem _to get
enough of them.

Since soap operas are on dur-
ing the day, students ﬁnd many
ways to catch a glimpse of their

‘favorite hunks and divas. Some

buy magazines, others tape
them, but many use the old-
fashioned method — skip class
or schedule classes around
them. 1

“I’ll skip class if something
exciting is going to happen that
day,” said Meegan Galie. “I ran
out of class because I thought
Karen was going to confess her
love to Jagger [on General
Hospitaﬂ, then she didn’t, and I
was so upset because I
skipped my class!” Galie said.

Many students think ahead,
as did Carrie Matesevac.
“Eighteen credits and I have no
class at 1,” Matesevac said, who
is a Days of Ourlives fan.

Sue Cespuglio said she tries
to have her class schedule done
by 3 p.m. so she can watch
General Hospital.

 

Many students, like Brian
Karavlan tape them everyday.
“Freshman year I skipped class
to watch Days [of Our Lives],
and then I realized the impor-
tance of school over them. I just
record them now,” Karavlan
said.

Many students don't even
know why they watch them. All
they know is that they’re
addicted. “I just get hooked and
can’t handle it anymore,”
Matesevac said.

Students also watch night
time soaps. Beverly Hills 90210
and Melrose Place are on in
television lounges all over cam-
pus on Wednesday nights.

As the World Turns, soaps
can run the Days of Our Lives.
There is only One Life To
Live, so catch a glimpse of a
soap opera and find out why
students are Louirzg them. Do
it now while you’re in school,
while you’re Young and
Restless, Bold and Bea-zztzful,
because the next time you
may have the chance to watch
them is when you retire to
Beverly Hills 90210. Then All
My Cbtla’ren will visit you
at General Hospital while
you’re waiting for the Guiding
Light to take you to Another
World.

promise for the Republican
Party is that for the Senate seat
currently held by democrat
Harris Wofford. '

Everlof said the race for the
seat is “probably one of the
most exciting races” for the
Republican Party in the near
future. 1

That race is “a great opportu-
nity to take back the state,” said
Everlof.

Everlof expressed conﬁdence
Representative Rick
Santorum can capture the
Senate seat. ‘

“That’s going to be a tight
race, at least a tight primary,” he
said.

“But Santorum is a sure
favorite to win.”

The only problem Everlof
foresees for Rick Santorum

would be if Teresa Heinz,_

Heinz, decides to run in the
election. Heinz has told

going quietly into the night,”
Holland said. Wolmark did not
agree to any of the propositions
that were given by the universi-

I ty, according to Holland.

The Faculty Assembly
demanded that the university
“immediately begin a search for
the position of senior vice chan-
cellor of Health Sciences.”

They also want an evaluation
of the performance of Jeffery
Romoff, senior vice chancellor
of Health Administration and
president of UPMC, using the
guidelines for searches forthe

top academic officers to begin

immediately.

The Assembly, wants
to “require the medical school
to follow the plaintiff and bud-
get system as designed-, thereby
having properly formed
departmental and school PBC’s
which pass the results if their
planning and budgeting to
the PBC of the I Senior
Vice Chancellor of Health
Sciences.” Two other cases of
violation of standard processes
that happened in the past year
were also discussed in detail. “It
is a terrible front to pass on
tenure. I trust that those respon-
sible for protecting faculty with-
in the administration of the uni-
versity will take appropriate
steps,” Holland said. _

hands. The widespread form
will attack all of the skin, and
may damage intemal organs.”

McCann compared sclero-
derma to rheumatoid arthritis
because of their similar crip-
pling’ effects.

“Scleroderma is a very dis-
abling disease. It makes the
skin very hard and the joints
impossible to bend,” she said.
“It can also be a fatal disease if
it causes damage to vital

organs such as the heart, kid-'

neys and lungs.”

According to a hand-
book produced by the
United Scleroderma Foun-
dation, a total of 700,000 cases
of localized and wide-
spread scleroderma ‘have
been reported in the United
States.

The handbook states that
while the disease can strike
anyone, women are four times
as likely to develop the
disease.

Symptoms of the disease
begin to surface in people
between-the ages of 30 to
50, but women are generally

affected more during their
child-bearing years.

The year—long study, spon-
sored by Therakos Inc., was
developed to evaluate the
safety and effectiveness of
photopheresis in treating the
disease.

Photopheresis is a proce-
dure in which the patient
ingests a photo—active

‘drug. The patient’s blood

is then drawn through
a machine that isolates
and exposes the white blood
cells to ultraviolet light,
manipulating the chemicals
within the cells and prevent-

ing diseased cells from repro-
ducing. The blood is then
returned to the patient’s circu-
lation.

During the procedure, the
patient may receive either two
active or two placebo photo-
pheresis treatments on two
consecutive days every four
weeks for a year.

McCann said volunteers
are needed for the study, and
anyone between the ages
of 18-65, with newly diag-
nosed, widespread scleroder-
rna, is urged to contact
UPMC’s department of derma-
tology.

No oﬁftce too small

Yesterday’s elections told us more than that Tom
Murphy is going to be Pittsburgh’s next mayor. They
also said something about elections in general.

Even with a lot of the bars closed, voters did not
come out in droves. According to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, Allegheny County officials estimate that 42
percent of registered voters in Allegheny County
showed up at the polls to pick their favorites for many
government offices including mayor. This number is
comparable to the 40 percent of those registered
statewide who voted in the last off-year election in
1989. “Off-year elections such as this one, with low
profile state judicial elections at the top of the ticket,
typically yield voter turnout  ,” (Post-Gazette).

Last year, approximately 84 percent of registered vot-
ers in Allegheny County went to‘ the polls to pick
America’s new pregident. While the numbers of regis-

tered voters have been low, and the percentage of“

those who actually voted is even lower, the problem is
even worse for local elections.

Just because an office might not have much power
on a national level, doesn’t mean that it can’t do
important ‘things right here in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh
has many problems such as crime and safety that
could best be helped by qualified local officials. ‘But
these are not the only elections where voters are apa-
thetic. The University of Pittsburgh has not had a very
impressive record itself. U * ’

With the number of Pitt undergraduates hovering

' around 15,000, the number of students who voted for

Student Government Board president in the last few
years has been a small percentage of that. ,
In 1991, approximately 1,315 students voted for SGB

;. ..-p.resident.i This number rose in last year’s elections,

but only to 2,057. In the last 10 years, the number of

‘ voters has never climbed above the 2,900 in 1984.

Although many students don’t attach too much

‘ importance on SGB, the board is responsible for a lot
.. of what goes on at the university. The president and

the eight members of the board represent all under-

‘ graduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences,

Engineering, Nursing and Pharmacy schools, not only
to the university but to’ government_ofﬁ‘cials‘ as well.
u ,_What. should also be of. interest to many students is

 .isl"alsohiresponsible for allocating 50 percent
0 of the student activity fee. The board also has commit-

tees that deal with public safety, judicial questions,
academics affairs and student’ relations. These are all
areas which students should be concerned about.
Before this year’s SGB elections on Nov. 17, students
should try to find out which candidates will best rep-
resent their concerns. A Meet the Candidates session is
scheduled for tonight at 6 p.m. in David Lawrence
120-121. Students should attend and vote informed.

The office of the U.S. president is not the only one
that matters. - 1

3 I know what you’re thinking. America is the

greatest country in the world, right? After all, our .

forefathers left Europe and the atrocities that
existed there, so that they could find and
achieve complete freedom. Well, maybe that
was the original intention, but now our nation
has become an embarrassment to the very term
freedom.

Now don’t misunderstand me before I’ve even
begun to mount my soapbox
for the next twenty inches or

U.S. constitution, history not truth

that America can be saved from the evil wrath
of unconstitutional things.
Well, I’ll tell you what’s unconstitutional - try-

ing to figure out what a bunch of old men

meant when they wrote a document 200 years
ago.

I mean, how smart could these people have
been? After all, they wore stockings and thick,
heavy clothing in the summer and rarely took
showers; all without the luxury
of Old Spice. ’

probably not want to live any-
where else but America. But that doesn’t mean
that we should rest on our laurels just because
Dave Matta says he would grace us by living
here. .

Our country could, in fact, be a lot greater.
Now let’s take a gander at how that might be
achieved. ' ‘

The first thing we should do is take the
‘Constitution, mount it in a beautiful frame and
place it in a very.esteemed‘sp_otsomewhérein ‘a
museum where people from far and wide can
come and gaze at it as a very important part of
our history.

Because that’s what it is. History.

It was written a long time ago by a bunch of
funky dudes in white wigs wearing tights who
were locked in a hot room for days and just
wanted to produce something before their wives
back home got impatient and ran away with the
mailman. , I l n

It has little or no applications to the way
things are now, and knowing that, it should not
be the primary focus of so many of the legal
geniuses across the country who get paid a lot
of money to interpret what those sweating patri-
ots meant.

If those great historical figures had any con-
cept of what modern day America would have
been like, then they would have had the fore-
sight to do the whole Constitutional Congress by

~ conference call -or sent faxes from the beach

because AT &T “will take us there.”

We’re always hearing about how the over-
publicized Supreme Court has to decide
whether something is “constitutional” or not so

 

Guns are stupid. Guns are for stupid people
who feel important when they have them in
their hands: people who otherwise feel inade-
quate without them.

It’s true. Look it up. Guns kill people, people
kill people and people with guns kill people.

Since we don’t live in a country where we can ’ V

eliminate people and be populated by guns,

‘then the next best thing is to get rid of guns and
bea country of people.

While everyone is entitled to their own opin-
ion, if you disagree with me, then you’re just
wrong. And stupid. Maybe if we stopped being
a country of gun—toting, self-absorbed, alcoholic
wife—beaters, then we could stop worrying about
our right to bear arms and just live and be
happy. _

Yeah, I know, how boring. Actually, I know
just what would make things better. A gazebo
on the William Pitt Union lawn.

Yeah, that would just about solve everything. I
can only wish I’d thought of such a brilliant
idea. 0

What would it take to make America a happy
and wonderful country? I really don’t think that
we need to add anything. We just need to dis-
pose of a few things. Let’s start with guns and
that will leave a few more hundred children
who were caught in the cross-fire in this country
to help do away with the rest of the disposable
items.

It would be a beginning anyway. Live and let
live. -

Pitt stuffs Robert Morris in OT,

Gorsin goal a
gives Panthers
season-ending
victory over
the Colonials

Byjason Brame
Asst. Sports Editor

Like an exasperated mother,
fed up with her children’s bed-
jumping and rowdiness on the

‘ last day of school, Pitt’s J.L.

Gorsin scored after almost 110'

minutes of play to ﬁnally turn
off the Pitt. Stadium lights and
put the Panther’s 1995 soccer
season to bed.
0 His goal at-109:20 of the
game — midway through the
second overtime period ——
gave Pitt a 1-0 win over intra-
city rival Robert Morris College
and officially, without any fur-
ther adieu, ended the season.
“This team’s been coming
back all year —- we’ve had a
few gut checks and we
responded,” Pitt defender Bob
Dyer said. “I’m happy with the
effort that this team’s put forth.
Pitt’s a hardworking team and
that’s the way it’s got to be.”
“Robert Morris is a very
good team and it was a big
win for our guys,” Pitt head
coach Joe Luxbacher said.
“We have a very good group

. of seniors and this was a good
' way to send them off.”

Even thoughthe season will
not progress into the Big East
tournament, the Panthers took
some consolation in beating a
team that, for most all the
game, talked trash on the
same Pitt players who they

Pitt goalie Kirk Brodows‘ makes one of his six saves last night against Robert Morris.

team up with for summer
league games next year.

“Every time we’d hit they’d
say ‘You’re cheap, you’re
dirty, you can’t play,” Pitt for-
ward Erik Duffy said. “Now
they can say whatever they
want — they got their tourna-
ment, but if we were in their
conference we’d be hosting
that tournament.”

“[The intensity] wasn’t there
in the beginning, but they

started hitting us and started‘
talking a little trash, which got"

to us,” Dyer said. “Even at the

end of the game they were
talking some smack, but we
came away with a 1-0 win and
all you gotta do is point to the
scoreboard and show ‘em.”

“It would have been nice to
win for the rights of who was
the better team in Pittsburgh,
but the big games for us are
this weekend [in the Northeast
Conference Tournament],”
Robert Morris head coach
John Kowalski said.

Kowalski’s club played a
ball-control, possession-type
offensive game, keeping the

lethal Pitt attack from doing
the damage that it has done all

Why did Penn State lose

Saturday? 95,000 fans at Ohio
Stadium could probably tell,
and one Pitt News sportswriter
-can easily provide a reason.

Penn State can’t pass. No aeri-

al attack whatsoever.

Sure the big, bad Lions can

run for 400 yards and put 70
points onthe board against a

doprmat like Maryland, but_

Saturday afternoon they faced a

real team. ‘ "
Ohio State was a loaded gun,

cocked and waiting for Joe and

‘his run-happy bullies as they
— paraded into Columbus.

Only this time, PSU couldn’t
run. a

This wasn’t Maryland or
Rutgers. The Buckeye defense
bent but didn't break, allowing
a measly 149 yards on .the

ground. When the gun went off, B
‘the wounded Lions staggered

home on the short end of a 24-6
drubbing. .

Finding his team down big,
Patemo had to use a four-letter

word known as “pass” to try to

_ get his demoralized troops back

in the game.
What a . disaster.
With the Rose Bowl rapidly

fading as the game progressed,

the season fell into the inca-
pable hands of Kerry Collins.

Letting this guy throw 39
times is like playing catch with a
hand grenade. You can only last
so long, until something blows
up in your face. The grenade
did blow up, in the form of four
interceptions, and right injthe
face of Patemo.

A ship that once had Rose
Bowl and National
Championship aspirations is
now sinking. The Lions can’t
pass and can’t. beat a quality
opponent. The quarterback situ-
ation’ is frightening. Poor Penn
State. '. ' "

As a current board member of
Student Government, I have done my
best to act as a liaison between the
students and thetadministration. I am
the only presidential candidate that
has served as acting President of the
Board, which has given me a greater
understanding and valuable insight
into the inner workings of the Student
Govrnnt office. As a past member of the Allocations
committee, I was appointed as Business Manager and
Allocations liaison to the current board; a position responsi-
ble for overseeing the distribution of the Student Activities
Fees to the certified student organizations. I am dedicated to
implementing further budgetary policies which will provide a
greater benefit to all students. My involvement has earned
me a seat on the Director of the Library Search Committee,
CAS Dean’s Council, and Omicron Delta Kappa, the leader-
ship honor society. I am President and Founder of the col-
lege Rotary club (ROTARACT), a volunteer for the past two
years with Hand in Hand, a teaching assistant, a member of
Phi Gamma Delta, and a mentor. If elected, I will continue
listen to your concerns, and do the best job I can to work
with the administration to implement policies which directly
coincide with them.

As an SGB member, I have estab-

them are new student discounts at
local businesses and a Computerized
Survey Initiative that serves to collect
student opinions more efficiently.

I have learned from my experience
 on board that having an accessible

dents dramatically increases programs’ effectiveness. A way
to achieve this is with a mixture of policies that will serve as a
resource for the SGB. It involves the “roving pen”—keeping
I track of student concerns while engaged in everyday conver-

sations. I will also phone students to discover opinions on

issues like administrative access, safety, and professor quality.

These policies, combined with the Computerized Survey

Initiative, will provide the SGB with a pool of student con-
A cerns for future programs. I also plan to increase the number

of Open Forums already in place to allow for more student

access to administrators.

I believe that my experience in student government and my
ability to complete projects constitutes proven leadership.

Ross Pasquale

As a member of the 1992 Student
Government Board, the Board of
Trustees Academic Affairs/Libraries
Committee, the University Senate
; Council and the president of the
Omicron Delta Kappa National
Leadership Honor Society, as well as

facilitator program, the Sexual
Assault and Violence Education com-
mittee and Residence Life, I have acquired the depth and
breadth of leadership experience necessary to fulfill and
exceed the duties of the highest elected undergraduate office
and to motivate and unify the newly elected student govem-
ment board. . ‘

My philosophy of student governance hinges of the idea
that the elected representatives must fulfill the definition of
their titles——they must represent the concems of their con-
stituents in a highly visible manner. Rather than practicing
“splendid isolation” and making important decisions about
student life without proper input, the student government
board must take an active and productive stance in seeking
information and creating and maintaining a constant dialogue
with Pitt’s governance groups, student organizations, on- and
off—campus populations and commuters.

I feel that leadership and service are entwined, and I want
the opportunity to utilize my leadershipuexperience to serve
the student body as its judicious and thdlightful representa-
tive. .

 

participation in the mentor/diversity '

Douglas Herman
Churchill once said that “the world
would be happier if its leaders had
more vision and fewer nightmares.”
Toward achieving this end, I would
focus upon the poor communication
and numerous misconceptions which
exist between the students, SGB, and
Administration. As President, my pri-
ority would be to establish defined
. and Dubliclv recognized lines of
communication between the Board and its committees; fur-
ther, each Board member would possess a publicly recog-
Egl sphere of inﬂuence. Students would: know to whom
' they should address specific concerns; be able to watch the
solution process unfold; and know to whom any complaints
should be addressed if the results are unsatisfactory. Other
proposed reforms include the creation and re-defining of
committees, a focus on allocations “fine tuning,” and upgrad-
ing the communication between student groups and SGB.

I possess the theoretical training to handle this job (political
science/communications major), and “real life” experiences
(working as “staff” on a presidential, gubernatorial and sev-
eral state elections) only add to my abilities. Having worked
at the University since my sophomore year of high school, I
know Pitt—-as the President of the student interest group,
Students United for Responsible Government, I also know
what Pitt students want!!

other recent changes: Coach Johnny

proud Panther team; Chancellor

It is my ability to manage, to lead, and to understand stu-

President. Many of these concerns are familiar: safety,
resources, and apathy. I can work to tackle these issues with
organized, thorough direction to the board and student orga-
nizations.

I have become familiar with our campus and its channels of
communication through my experiences in mentoring and
various executiveboard positions. Three years of students
have been able to benefit from my leadership and hard work
as a mentor and information coordinator with the Office of
New Student Programs. With these skills I hope to continue
where past leaders have laid the groundwork, creating a
respectable and secure campus environment for the student
body. '

Let me put my skills to work for you, and together let’s con-

African Cultural Center and a Women’s Studies Major. Also I
will improve many of the services already provided, for
example the always confusing shuttle system. Furthermore, a
portion of my agenda is géared specifically toward African-

Unity, Inclusion, and Retention. _

Chris Fedeli  

Since I came to the University of
Pittsburgh as a freshman, I have had
a strong desire to improve the uni-
versity community and devote my
time and talents to make Pitt work
for its most valuable constituents —
if the students. I have done just as the
current chairperson of the Academic
Affairs Committee of the Student
Government Board, where I am directing such projects as
student academic complaint/compliment forms, scholarship
listings in the Miscellaneous Guide, The Bridge of
Knowledge book donation program, student evaluation of
CAS advisors and a student-run course evaluation guide. In
addition, I currently serve as student representative on both
the Senate Committee on Education Policies and CAS Dean’s
Council. -

If elected to Board, my goals will be to better open the
lines of communication between SGB and the student body,
to create more opportunities for students to take an active
role in the workings of Student Government Board and to
increase the inﬂuence of SGB on the university governance
structure, thereby bringing more power to the students.

Today, SGB is at a pivotal point where we can either make
great leaps forward or stumble behind. To move ahead, SGB
will need experienced leaders, and I strongly believe that I
can provide such leadership.

Deena Buchanan

The students at the University of
Pittsburgh elect eight Student
Government Board Members to
attend to their needs, wants and con-
cerns. At present, increasing levels of
apathy are reflections of frustration in
-_ the student body’s attempt to voice
’- its needs. I am prepared to personal-
ly gather student opinions and sug-
-  A - - gestions on a continual basis
throughout ‘my term as a board member. My main focus will
be to create an atmosphere in which the student body feels
that it is being adequately represented in every way; I hope
to actively recruit student opinion concerning the roleof the
proposed multicultural center. Diversity education and
understanding is an ongoing need that we cannot afford to
overlook. .

I intend to seek administrative opinion while relaying stu-_
dent concerns on pressing issues which arise on campus.
Likewise, I hope to facilitate strong communication not only
between student groups, but between students and what
many label an inaccessible administration.

Another toplpriority would be the establishment of a
women’s studies major and the organization .of more sexual
assault and violence awareness programs throughout the
campus community.

installing change machines, improve safety in the dorm by

better match roommates, and I will work with Support

I will also work to improve quality of professors by setting

students, identify mediocre professors, and through proper
channels, address these concerns. My personal emphasis as a
Board member will be cost control and reaching out to stu-

Jason McCright

The University has reached a point
where effective student government
is more important than ever. That
Student Government must adapt to ,
change, or it will be in danger of
becoming obsolete and ineffective.

I believe that experience is the best
teacher, and those we place in -office
should have the most experience
«  possible. As a freshman representa-
tive to RSA, I learned about representing people. As a mem-
ber of SGB’s Freshman Council, I received an in-depth look
at the operation of the Board. As a 2-year Director of the Pitt
Program Council, I have familiarized myself with policies
that regulate finance and administration. All of this gives me
the necessary background for operating within the
University, which is essential to accomplish anything.

Students demand fiscal responsibility and results,
with changes necessary in safety, the transportation system,
and student services. You must elect someone who can get
things done for you.

A student is but a part‘ of a whole that is in? need of more

“These students have some

Pasquale said.‘ According to
Pasquale, he decided to run this
year because of the highly qual-
ified candidates running for
board positions. “I don’t know
if an opportunity like this will
ever present itself again,”
Pasquale said. “Any combina-
tion of the 14 candidates for
board will be a fairly diverse
group. I have confidence that a

Scerbo said he thinks a lot
can be accomplished only if the

the Resident Student

Society, Panhellenic Association
and the Inter—Fraternity Council.

Brody, the 1993 president, is
the first to receive reimburse-
ment for his tuition as a result of
a 1992 SGB bill. Although none
of the presidential candidates
would say it motivated their
own aspirations, all of the can-
didates said it was a factor in
the unprecedented six person
race. ,

“It is evident that some peo-
ple may be running for the
tuition stipend,” Fo-ner said.
“But it is not an unfair plan, the
SGB president doesn’t have
time to hold down a separate
job.” * ,

Pasquale, who served on the
boa_rd which passed the plan.

-also said the reimbursement is a

good idea.

“When you look at the hours
required of the SGB presidency,
the tuition stipend is about min-
imum wage,” Pasquale said.

Despite the fact that the reirn—
bursement was put in place to
increase the candidate field, a
goal which has been -realized in
this campaign, some candidates
said they see problems with it.

“I don’t think you’d see some

there was no reimbursement,”
Moody said. “I’ve been working

Loss to
Georgetown
still lingers
for class of '94

'ByJeffKamis

Staff Writer

As the ﬁnal buzzer sounded,
ending the game and the 1993
season, the seniors on the Pitt
soccer team wished it was just
a bad dream. i

‘The Panthers had defeated
intra—city rival Robert Morris, 1-0
in overtime, but the memory of
Sunday’s loss to Georgetown
still remained. Pitt was not
going to the Big East tourna-
ment this season, ending the
hopes of Pitt’s departing class.

“Nothing can make up for not
going to Big East,” senior cap-
tain Ted Noethling said. “We
were really close, and we didn’t
get it.” ’

Erik Duffy, who led Pitt with
10 goals, said he wishes things
had turned out differently.

“I had tears in my eyes after
Georgetown, I couldn’t look at

anyone,”-Duffy said. “But it’

means something because they
are right down the road and I’m

Michael Bacasa said he saw a
lot of good in beating RMU.
“Tonight definitely matters,
it’s good to end the season on a
good note, especially after
going into overtime,” he said.
But Bacasa admitted that the

I loss to Georgetown with a play-

off berth on the line will not be
easily forgotten..

“It hurt bad, our backs were
against the wall three games
ago, then we came away with
two big wins,” Bacasa said. A“It
just seemed like we were meant
to win on Sunday, but we
couldn’t come up with a win.”

For Andy Tsouris, who
missed all of last season with an
injury, being so close and then
losing was tough to take.

“It’s really disappointing
because we were really rolling,”
Tsouris. “You get a lot of confi-
dence when you win those big
games [on the road], and that
carried over from last year.”

Head coach Joe Luxbacher

said that the seniors had a major ‘

impact during their years at Pitt.
“Our success the last two or
three yearslhas been a direct
result of their leadership,”

It is clear to see what the
seniors have meant to the pro-
gram, with Pitt setting a school
record for wins and advancing
as. the second seed to the con-
ference tournament a year ago.
This year, Pitt rebounded from a
1-3-1 start in conference play to
come within Sunday’s game of
earning a postseason berth for

the second straight year.

All the guys agreed that Pitt
soccer is moving in the right
direction.

“Joe needs to keep bringing
in good young players from

headed in the right direction,”
John Lopus said.

Bacasa, who got his degree
last year, said he will always

more year. _
“To get the chance toiplay

appreciated it. It was awesome,”
Bacasa said.
Noethling said he will never

said his goal and last year’s win
over Seton Hall won’t soon be
forgotten.‘ Tsouris said his only
career goal, in a 9-0 nail-biter
against Canisius, was his most
memorable personal highlight.

Duffy said the night before
last year’s Big East semifinals
will always stick with him.

“We were sitting around
watching Big East highlights,
and we were one of the four
teams in the tournament,” Duffy
said. “It was the greatest feeling

and I’ll never forget making the _

perfect record this Saturday
night at Boston College.

' “It’s a special thing,” Braziel

1 ‘ said. “I think the girls will be

excited by the ﬁnality of it.”

The Eagles have stumbled
into their usual position at the
bottom of the Big East with an

1' 8-18 overall record, 0-5 against

Big East competition. ‘ »
“Knowing Boston College is
in last place in our conference,
it will be interesting to see how
the team responds. It is still in

       
Volleyball eyes unbeaten Big

the Big East, so the team will be
up for it.”

Rookie outside hitter Deanna
Herman is the top attacker (246
kills), passer (217 digs) and
server (25 aces) for the Eagles.
By comparison, Ann Marie
Lucanieleads Pitt with 406 kills,
517 digs and 47 service aces.

The disparity is just as wide
on the team 1evel._ Pitt has a
large edge across the board,

including attack percentage

(.240 to .174), digs (1452 to
1272) and service aces (187 to
162). '
Pitt will visit another unim-
posing opponent in its other

match of the weekend when.

‘they play the Rhode Island
Rams (9-13 overall, 4-6 in the
Atlantic 10) Friday night.

“They are not as strong as
they have been in the past,”
Braziel said. “It is not shaping

up to be a real challenging
weekend in any way.”

Braziel cautioned against the
letdowns that have plagued the
Panthers all season.

“[The Rams] are on their home
floor,” Braziel said. “Beating a
team like Pittsburgh at this point
can make your season. They are
not gimmees.”

The Rams are an extremely

' thin team, with only two players

they can bring off the bench.
Rhode Island only has one hitter
with an attack percentage over
.200, middle blocker Christa
Ross (.244), and the team is
combining to hit a lowly .162.

Like the Panthers, Rhode
Island has beaten up on Big
East teams, knocking off
Providence and Villanova earli-
er this season. The Rams lost all
three of their matches against
common opponents they have
with Pitt outside the Big East —
Duquesne, West Virginia and
Hofstra. The Panthers beat
Duquesne and West Virginia
easily and split their two match-
es against Hofstra.

With the competition level’

where it is, Braziel said Pitt’s
focus is now on building for the
rest of the season.

“There are two themes right
now,” Braziel said. “One is surg-

'I'HE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, November 3, 1993

I was really proud to be a Pitt
Panther when I went to the Pitt
men’s and women’s swimming
and diving meet against
Syracuse last Saturday. Aside
from being weirder than a col-
lection of left-handed comic
book readers, the Pitt swim-
mers and divers are some of the
most exciting and emotional
athletes I’ve ever seen.

(4-8, 4.37 ERA) and a suspect
bullpen.

Point is, with the NFL expand-
ing to Charlotte and either St.
Louis or Baltimore, there’s
gonna be some more ex-World
Leaguers running around for the
1995 season. No position will be
weaker than quarterback.’

A good backup quarterback is
as hard to come by as a red

squirrel this sea-
son. Just ask the
Eagles, who have

shot contenders
in the NFC East
with Randall

teams have.
The Pitt men (3-O) won 154-
87 and the Pitt women (2-1)

. won 152-91. And for being so

early in the season their times
were fast. It looks like both
teams are poised to regain the
Big East titles that used to be
commonplace here at "Pitt. The
men last won the Big East in the
1991-92 season, and the women
last won in 1990-91.

So if you get the chance, go
check them out on Saturday
against Miami. The meet begins

early, at 9_ a.An1.,.to1accon1modate _- _

the football game in the after-
noon. Hey, -is there any chance
that they could play the football
game at 9 a.m. so everybody
didn’t have to wake up so early
for the meet?
°Along withthe expansion of,

any league, comes a dilution of
players. When the baseball
expanded to Florida and
Colorado last season, no posi-
tion was left thinner than the

pitcher. Finding quality pitchers ’

to fill out a staff became the
equivalent of pouring skim milk
through a strainer.

For example, after Joe
Magrane -— yes that’s GQ Joe
Magrane —- was traded by the
Cardinals to the Angels after —
going; 8-10 with a 4.97 ERA, _
California promptly signed him§

for‘L§‘_,,_th_ree years. Jack Morris, with. n.

 of 6.19, started 27
gafttes for the Blue Jays. Even
Braves’ heralded staff had a
weak _-‘ﬁfth starter in Pete Smith

Cunningham at quarterback, to
plain shot with Ken O’Brien.

Couple that with the rash of
injuries that attacks the quarter-
back position every year and
the waiting line for quality QB’s
in 1995 is gonna be a
loooooooong one. So if I’m a
GM for any team other than the
Buffalo Bills (Iim Kelly & Frank
Reich), I’m going to Oregon and
finding the hole that Todd
Marinovich is fishing in and
signing his butt!

0 Speaking of ex—Wo_rld
Leaguers, the Dolphins’ Scott
Mitchell has played so well in
place of Dan Marino that there’s
no reason not to think the
Dolphins are still the AFC’s best
hope for the Super Bowl.

The Dolphins are 5-0 in
games since Marino ruptured
his achilles tendon. Mitchell is
44 of 68 for 652 yards with six
touchdown passes and one

V interception for a 119.2 rating. M
His mobility evenadds adif-"

ferent look to the Dolphins
offense that wasn’t there with
the pure-pocket-passing _
Marino. With Mitchell’s passing

and a strong Dolphins’ running 9

behind Mark Higgs, Terry Kirby,’

and Keith Byars, the Dolphins

0 who was the mop—up man six

"years ago for the mediocre
Bulls. Now, after two years in
Europe, he is back, this time to
fill Mr. Jordan’s void —— NOT! ‘
Well, the three-peat (I hope
Pat Riley doesn’t see this) Bulls
paida visit to the NBA-stricken
city of Pittsburgh to play at the
wonderful Civic Arena against
the Philadelphia 76ers last

Friday night. Apparently about.

2,000 people only wanted to
see Michael because ‘there were
many vacancies at the Arena -—
giving proof that Pittsburgh
does not deserve an NBA fran-
chise.

Okay. Let’s get down to the
nitty gritty. Will the Bulls four
peat? Will the Bulls win the
Central division? Will the Bulls
even make the playoffs?

Basketball writers around the
country, namely Chicago, are
saying the Bulls won’t even win
30 games this year.

Let me clear that up — that is
a bunch a Bull crap. Sure, the
Bulls are missing possibly the
greatest player to ever play the
game, but the supporting cast of
the previous championship
years wasn’t so bad, either..With
the acquisitions of Europe’s
own Jordan — Toni Kukoc —
and number one draft pick
Corey Blount, who has looked
great in the pre-season, to go
along with Horace Grant, BJ.
Armstrong and the Dream
T eam’s Scottie Pippen, the Bulls
won’t be a doormat.

an-less Bulls no title threat, but

No. They won’t four peat.
They probably won’t even win
the Central, opening the door
for the Jordan-plagued Cavs and
the young Hornets. But they
will make the playoffs, and

  Sean
Duncan

once they are in, anything could
happen for the experienced
Bulls.

So how did the Bulls look
without His Airness? Sure, they
beat up on a CBA- looking 76er
squad, but they showed many
positives in trying to fill the
huge gap. Scottie Pippen
looked like he could do what-
ever he wanted  whenever he
wanted. He pulled up for the 15
to 20-foot jumper and hit it con-
sistently (unlike last year), to go
along with his usual high-ﬂying
acrobatic dunks, posterizing
Shawn Bradley a couple of
times.

Without Jordan, Grant will
finally stop his whining and get
what he always wanted - to be a
go-to scorer. Look for Grant to
be the same workhorse and
glass cleaner as always, but also
look for 18 points a night.

The true question for the

‘ _ Bulls is who will step up and be

the leader of the team? Pippen?
No. He has proven time in and
time out that his decisions,

especially in crunch time, leaves
a lot to be desired.

So who? ,

BJ. Armstrong. He will be the
man the Bulls will look for to
make things happen and make
the right decisions.

Armstrong showed last Friday .

night that he is just that. He
made all the right passes to the
open man and pulled up for the
“J” when it was there. He also
showed he could take it to the
big buys and convert, as he did
over Bradley. The NBA three-
point percentage leader looks
even more deadly than last
year. ‘Every year, Armstrong has
improved and finally this year
he will get his props.

Where the Bulls really lack is
the bench. Scott Williams, John
Pawson and Stacey King are all
injured so the‘ Bulls will look for
some bench punch from the
unproven Kukoc and Blount.

As everyone knows, Bulls
center Bill Cartright is not get-
ting any younger. So if there’s a
Will there’s a way. Perdue will
get the minutes he has com-
plained about. St. John’s fans
will be happy to see the Bull’s
roster when they read Bill

~ Wennington’s name. Know he

has been out of the league for a
while, and when he was in the
league no one saw his name in
the box score, but he did man-
handle Bradley in the post. _

Then again, who didn’t?

The Bulls were obviously
missing the pizazz they had in

problem with

better than advertised

the Jordangera, but they still
look like a solid team. The
the World
Champs as you can see, there
are just too many questions.

-For all you 76er fans out
there — you can hang your
heads. It appears that the No. 1
pick and, second overall, seven-
foot-five-inch Shawn Bradley
hasn’t picked up a ball since his
mission. Even Mugsy Bogues
could push him around in the
post.

-Some good Philly news,
though. Back-up center Moses
Malone can still score, and will
continue to score ‘til he’s 60.

-Clarence Weatherspoon
dominated the baseline with
rim-rattling dunks, but that is all
he worked on in the off—season.
He still can’t shoot from outside
fifteen feet to save his life.

-The Civic Arena’s junior
highannouncer just doesn’t cut
it in the NBA. Come on.
Announcing a shot that hung on
the rim, he said: “A danish. A
sweet roll for Armstrong.”

‘-For all those bandwagon
Bulls’ fans it’s time to get a new
starter jacket maybe
Charlotte. Those are real pretty
colors.

-A little Pitt basketball for
those select fans. Don’t believe
the pre-season hype of Pitt fin-
ishing eighth or ninth in the
conference. Some people, are
just ignorant. \

Morris goalie Vasil Chapla.

“They threw the ball in and it
came to me. I beat one guy, J.L.
called for the ball, I slid it
through to him and he just
tucked it away,” Prex said.

“I got a beautiful pass from

’ Prexie and I was open,” Gorsin

said. “We were driving toward

- the net the whole game and I

was glad we got one.”

“J.L. played it to Prexie and
then ran through and Prexie just
slid it through and beat the
‘keeper one on one,” Dyer said.
“There really wasn’t any break-
down on their part, but it was a
good play on our part. Hey,
good passing beats good
defense any time.”

“It came over and scooted
through and was kind of a
breakaway,” Chapla said. “I
hadn't given up a goal all year
and I wanted to finish off the
year without giving a goal.”

It was Gorsin’s first goal of the
year, and ran Pitt’s record to 9-

' 5-5, dropping ‘Robert Morris to

12-6-1.
“They earned it,” John
Kowalski said. “The last

vidual effort by [Gorsin] and he
individually made the effort.”
Gorsin’s goal almost did not
come. In the second half, with
the score tied and the intensity
starting to pick up, Pitt defender
Charlie Wasson was whistled
for an infraction inside the Pitt
goal box, prompting the third

penalty kick and second kick V

against in the past two games.

“I was thinking ‘not again,”’
Dyer said. “I wasn’t'sure if it
was a foul, because there was
some contact but it didn’t war-
rant [a penalty kick].”

Robert Morris’ David Moxom,
who was second on the team
with 19 points, lined up the shot
while Brodows waited on his
heels at the goalline. 4

“I knew it wasn’t going in,”
Kowalski said. “I’ve been
around the game enough and I
could "sense the emotions and
feel it, and I know it in these sit-

- uations.”

And much like the prophet
Babe Ruth, who nonchalantly
pointed into the centerfield
bleachers in Chicago in 1952
before promptly clubbing what

_might be the most famous

“I asked Duffy which way he
goes because he plays with him
lot and he said that he goes to
the left side, so I said I was
going left no matter what,”
Brodows said. “He took a big
run up, I took one step to the
left and he kicked it right — it
just wasn’t a very well shot PK.”

“Kirk’s pretty good on the PK
but realistically most of the time
the penalty shot scores, so I was
hoping that he didn’t put one in
the corner that was unsave-
able,” Luxbacher said. “Some
give it up, but Kirk battles.”

“So I was sitting at mid-field
and he looks at me and I point-
ed to his left because I played
against Mosson before and he
shot it that way,” Duffy said.

Duffy, a senior, finished his
career by leading the Panthers
in scoring this season. His 29
points bested second-place
Porter, who missed last night’s
game because of a red card and
subsequent one—game suspen-
sion he received in Sunday
against Georgetown, by 11. \/

“I would give it all up to have
zero [points] and zero [assists] if
we could just have the Big East
for one more game, and that my
honest hearts reaction,” he said.
“Coach put me in position that if
I’m not the leading scorer than
I’m notvdoing my job. I get more
chances than everyone game in
and game out so it’s more my
position than my ability."'

single match is going to be a
battle,’’ Braziel said. “It’s hard
not to be excited. You can start
to see the light at the end of the
tunnel [with post—season
approaching]. That adds an ele-

ment of excitement."

SERVES AND VOLLEYS: The
Panthers are still battling
injuries. Middle hitter Jennie
Driscoll and setter Annemarie
Mernagh are both day-to-day.
According to Braziel, other
players missed practice this
week for reasons “beyond their

control." Braziel said she
expects everybody to be able to
play this weekend.

°Mernagh is currently 11th in
the nation in assists with an
average of 12.697 per game.
Lucanie is number 12 in the
nation with 4.97 kills per game.

°Seton Hall, second in the

Big East with a 5-1 record (21-4
overall) is 12-1 since the

Panthers pulled out a four-game"

win in New Jersey on October
1. The University of Texas-El
Paso was the only other team to
knock off the Pirates. 
°Riga, Latvia native Baibla
Zake, who transferred to Seton
Hall from Moscow University
earlier this term, was named Big
East Player of the Week for the
second time this year Monday.
Zake led the Pirates to three
wins last weekend with a coin-
bined 36 kills and 59 digs. She is
the only Big East player with an
attack percentage over .400; she

missed the early part of the sea-

son before she transferred. Zake
has played in only 55 games. By

sive specialist Laura Horvath ‘ '
