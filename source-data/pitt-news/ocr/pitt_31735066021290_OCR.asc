Computer fee
imperative to
the Campus

of the Future

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

Stressing that the $55 com-
puter fee to be charged in Sep-
tember is not a tuition increase in
disguise, a University of Pitts-
burgh official said yesterday that
the fee was imperative to the
continuation of the Campus of
the Future program.

“What we have here is a total
system,” said Executive Vice
Presidentjack Freeman. “The only
way to provide [for the Campus
of the Future] is with an assured
sum of money.”

Although part of the third

- phase of the Campus of the Fu-

ture program will provide 200
new terminals for students and
faculty to use, there are other
plans, including the Norrs 11-
brary information system, which
will provide a listing of all mate-
rials in Pitt’s library system that
can be called from any terminal.

“Presumably, every student
goes to the library,” Freeman
said.

Another system that will be
installed at Pitt will be the Inte-

There is increased concern among Pitt’s
Chinese community for the well-being of rela-
tives still in China. The Chinese Government
this week began systematically arresting those
believed to be involved in China’s democracy
movement. .

. However, many of Pitt’s Chinese students
are no longer only anxious for their family and
friends back home. There is fear that they too
could be in danger if they speak out against
the government. a _

He and other Chinese students at Pitt are
telephoning, writing letters and faxing messages to

of because of a Chinese government cover-u p and

University
researchers
report AIDS

discoveries

By Jerome Lehmann
For The Pitt News

Pitt scientists searching for clues
to the cause of AIDS have made
a number of important discover-
ies and have recently. reported
their ﬁndings.

University researchers, who
since 1983 have received $20
million, mostly in grants, to study
the deadly disease, contributed
over 40 scientiﬁc presentations
to this year's Fifth International
Conference on AIDS held in
Montreal, Canada. The confer-
ence was attended by over 14,000
delegates and media personnel,
and involved approximately 1 ,700
oral and graphics presentations.

The highlight of the confer-
ence was the announcement by
polio vaccine pioneerjonas Salk
that he had developed a vaccine
which may cure people who have
the disease and those who pres-
ently have the virus in the early
stages. Salk told The Associated
Press that “it is becoming clear
that a diagnosis of Hlvpositivity
need not be regarded as a death

, sentence.” -

Signiﬁcant discoveries from Pitt

, scientists include: studies which

show that the age of an individ-
ual has an effect on the speed of
development of AIDS, evidence

that natural body killer cells may i

be able to defeat the virus if
stimulated properly, and data
which proves that there are dif-
ferent strains of the virus that
possess varying degrees of vir-
ulency.

infected hemophiliacs and found

Soz/z'etjoumalz'sz‘ gives the z'nsz'de~scoop on Eastern press

By John Berger
Contributing Editor

Andrei Baidak has seen the
inside workings of journalism
from both the East and the West.
He is currently a professional
intern at The Pittsburgh Post-Ga-
zette, in a working atmosphere
very different from what he was
accustomed to.

Baidak is a Soviet in America
as part of a journalistic exchange
program, sponsored in part by
the American Field Service. He
and two other Eastern European
journalists (another from the
U.S.S.R. and one from Poland)
are interning at American papers.
One American is already work-
ing in Moscow, and two other
internships are scheduled.

Baidak is an editor at the
N ovosti Press Agency in Moscow,

the second largest news organi- '

zation in the U.S.S.R., after TASS,
the governmental news agency.
Novosti was established in 1961

by a group of trade unions and
journalists. Primarily devoted to
feature writing, the agency puts
out more than 100 newspapers
and has its own publishing house.

‘They put out the Moscow News, a

paper that is published in five or
six different languages, including
English, Russian and Arabic. The
paper is among the most popular
and most controversial in the
Soviet Union.

He credits the editor in chief
for a great deal of the paper’s
popularity, saying, “Before, itwas
a very dull newspaper. It was
[written] for foreigners, tourists,
diplomats and foreign students
who live in Moscow and the
Soviet Union.”

But the current editor, whom
Baidak describes as “very inde-
pendent," made some changes.
“They started to run stories on
just about anything from prosti-
tution to the KGB."

Despite the colorful Holly-
wood iconography of an oppres-

sive Communist system, the Soviet
government made no attempt to
kill these stories before publica-
tion. Baidak comments, ‘I would
say it’s just misperoeption. There

is no direct governmental control _

of journalism.

“We have some newspapers
and magazines which are pub-
lished by the Communist Party
and government. But we also
have a lot of other newspapers
which are published by public
organizations, by big enterprises,

[and] by scientiﬁc institutes.”
But the government does
have some leverage to keep “state
secrets” secret. _ p _ 9
‘If you are speaking about
control," Baidak explains, “yes,
we have a special governmental

- agency which tries to prevent

leakage of state and military
secrets. You can ‘give them your
story for approval, and"“i’f they
approve it, they take all respon-

sibility for the story. But it’s up to '

you. If you feel that it’s not nec-
essary to show it to them you can
just run it by yourself.”
Although use of the agency.
is optional, there can be dire
consequences if it is not con-
sulted. “If we justimake a leak:

_ age, we will be responsible 

and can be punished.”

The press also has a voice,
now, and the power of the press
is a force to be reckoned with.
“l'Ihe government] had plans to
divert our Northern ‘rivers to the
south. It was the biggest project.

Some ‘ reasonable scientists

predicted that it could cause irre-
versible consequences for the
environment, so they criticized
it.” . ‘
After pressure from_ the
magazine Ogonyok (run by the
Novosti agency), and other pub-
lications, the plan was scrapped,
in Baidak’s opinion, “only be-

cause of the role of the press.” ,

Another incident in which
the press ﬁgured prominently
involved a teacher's newspaper,
Uchitelskaya Gazeta Although it
is published by the Soviet educa-
tion ministry, it often takes stands
against the policy and reforms
suggested by the  “Last
year, the ministry was so mad
that they even tried to close the
newspaper. They wanted just to
shut it down and start a new
publication,'and again it caused a
very big turbulence in the soci-
ety. Protests about newspapers
exist. I don't think these thoughts

about a strictly controlled press
are correct."

While protests exist, the tone
of a Soviet protest is far different
from theirAmerican counterparts’.
“We had a few [animal rights
demonstrations], but generally
small ones. Here you can find
them just [about] every day,”
Baidak said.

Other issues that spark heated
debate in the United States are
less controversial in the U.S.S.R.
“For example, abortion. We dis-
cuss it, but we don’t discuss the
problem of ‘Is it good or is it bad?
Should we stop abortions or

should we just [perrnitl them?’ We
discuss other problems — how
to decrease the number of abor-
tions, how to produce more
condoms, how to educate people,
how to make abortions more
safe.”

Baidak speaks of ‘these is-
sues and others with a journalist's
objectivity, but he has strong
feelings, especially concerning
the changesin his country.

“There is‘ a change in every-
day spiritual life,” he says. “People
are more involved in policy-
making. They can inﬂuence local
authorities. It's a big change.

I don’t think they want to lose
their positions and privileges, and
they will inevitably lose [them] if
all those developments continue.

We have three big areas of work
in the country. The first one is to
change our international policy,

the second is to improve our.

economy, and the third is some
changes in the sphere of public
life of democracy and so on.

Baidak feels that the change
in mentality is among the most
important “lWirhl changes in our
international policy, people are
starting to feel more secure. The
end of the war in Afghanistan,
improvements in Soviet-Ameri-
can relations, ﬁrst steps toward
disarmament — it has a very big
effect on the people. So in two of
these spheres we have very good
results.”

time when change and openness

_ are alive in the Soviet Union, is

However, he isn’t talking about

people and corporations have
donated money for the walk.

“This is really a positive expe-
rience,” he says. “So many people
have gotten involved. Athlete's
Foot in Shadyside even donated
shoes for my walk.

“I'm really looking forward to
walking across Pennsylvania on
Route 30, and meeting all of
these people. I'm bringing a
camera, and I will keep a jour-
nal."

Besides raising money, Zary
says that educating people about
the disease is a primary goal of
the walk, because people don’t
know how widespread the dis-

, ease is, even though one out of

“There are five million diabet-
ics in America that haven’t even
been diagnosed yet. It is impor-
tant to start treating this disease
as soon as possible,” he says.

The danger of complications is
also very real to Zary. He is
legally blind in his. left eye and
has experienced kidney failure in
the past.

“This is a personal challenge.
That is the main reason I'm doing

doesn’t look like the stereotypi-
cal ﬁtness enthusiast parodied by
Hans and Franz on Saturdaylvigbt

slacks, with dark, fine hair, and
glasses, he seems more helpful
than intimidating. However, he is
serious about his health.

Now 31, he was diagnosed as
diabetic 20 years ago during a
routine physical for basketball
camp. Zary says that he decided
to work in the health field at age
12, because of his own health
problems. He attended Slippery
Rock University in the late 1970s,
but left before graduating to work
at health clubs.

Zary says that he had played
with the idea of the walk for a
couple of years before he de-
cided on it. With the death of his
father from lung cancer in 1987,
and his divorce last year, he felt
it was time to make the walk a
reality.

“The walk will give me an
opportunity to sort some things
out in my own mind,” he says.
“When my. dad died, he had it

arranged that all donations [to his
memory] go to the American
Diabetes Association.  I am
dedicating this walk to the
memory of my father.

“If I can live with the dignity he 9

had in dying, I’d be a very satis-
fied person. The man showed me
more in how to conduct yourself
while on his deathbed, than more
people do their whole lives."
Zary says that he has" been

training extensively for the walk, ‘

de-emphasizing weights, and
working more on endurance
work. He rides his bicycle to
work with a 15-pound backpack,
and he estimates that he puts in
50 miles a week walking and
running. He says he is not wor-
ried about his diet during the
walk, even though he will be

It is hard to wake up from
some of our nightmares

All that Mel Blount wanted to do was help.

T 0 that end, the ex-Pittsburgh Steeler founded a home
for troubled boys in Georgia. It worked so well that he
wanted to open another one in Washington County.

But Washington County didn’t want it. It seems that part
of the problem involves the suspicion that the youths
might be black. T 0 this end, the Ku Klux Klan has gotten
involved, raising their loud and ignorant voices in protest.

Racism is intolerable, and this display of bigotry and
mindless fear is inexcusable. An attempt to help troubled
kids, of any race or cultu re (and this facility is for all races,
says Blount), should not be inhibited, it should be
encouraged. When fear consumes charity,the human

race is in very deep trouble.

Ethics and politics: using
one to judge the other

In the wake of Jim Wright's departure from the position

of speaker of the House of Representatives, in the midst

of investigations of Betty Dixon’s (wife of Julian Dixon,

head of the House Ethics Committee) rather startlingly

profitable (and unreported) investments, among all these

ethics storms, there is a small gem of news from the distant

past that bears some relation to the current scandals.

John jenrette was convicted of bribery and conspiracy

in the infamous Abscam scandals, and left the U.S.
Congress in 1980. He served 13 months in a prison and is

still on probation. He has been found guilty of shoplifting. .

He stole a necktie and a pair of shoes from a Washington,

D.C., department store.

Pretty pathetic. It seems that we need some sort of gauge

to elect to public office, because obviously, the current

Electing the imperfectprom king

Isn’t life funny? People get
away with so much, even mur-
der, and lose nothing— look
around, you see them every-
where. They are movie stars,
politicians, TV evangelists, dip-
lomats and prom kings.

 

The Pittsburgh Press reported
that Eric'Norstrom was trying to
meet his curfew when he ran his
mother's car into a group of stu-
dents. Amber Hunter, one of the
students, was killed, and five
others were injured. Norstrom, a
recent graduate of Santaluces
High School in Palm Beach, Fla.,
was convicted of vehicular
homicide, reckless driving and
culpable negligence in April.
Sentencing was delayed so that
Norstrom could complete the year
and graduate with his class.

One month later, juniors and
seniors elected him prom king. I
might not be an expert at defin-
ing “prom king,” but I always
thought that any person elected
to represent any group of people,
especially a group of impression-
able 16- and 17-"year-olds, should
at least be clear of any felony
convictions. I don’t understand
how a school boardcan be con-
cerned about proper dress of

students, attendance, grade point
averages, smoking on school
property and other similar mat-
ters, yet allow a convicted felon
to reign as prom king.

I think I can come to terms with
the reasoning behind the judge’s
decision to allow Norstrom to
complete his senior year. After
all, he may really need his di-
ploma when he goes to jail. What
I don’t understand is how Nor-
strom could continue with his
“normal” everyday life after kill-
ing someone.‘ Sure, maybe he
didn’t intentionally hit the group
and kill Miss Hunter, but accord-
ing to Janice Hamby, whose son
was critically injured in the acci-
dent, Norstrom has never visited
them or Mrs. Hunter to say he
was sorry or express his sympa-
thies. In fact, Norstrom attended
his prom in his new car (accord-
ing to Mrs. Hunter).

Norstrom’s nonchalant behav-
iorsurprises me, but I am more
amazed at the standards of the
students who elected him prom
king. His best ‘friend of eight
years said that he probably would
have been elected either way,
but that Norstrom really needed
the show of support. Support?
For someone who hasn't even
shown the slightest bit of ' re-
morse to the Hunters, who lost a
daughter, or to the others who
were injured? That, I’ cannot

"understand. Do these students

feel that driving recklessly to get
home on time is something ev-
eryone does, and Norstrom was
just unlucky? Do they think it was

just a freak accident that hap- V

pened to a popular guy? What is
wrong with these people? Ve-
hicular homicide is no “accident.”
Mrs. Hamby, Mrs. Hunter and
several other parents and stu-

in ‘‘~‘‘

dents know this. They picketed V g

the school for three days after
Norstrom was elected. To them,
it wasn’t simply dumb luck or a
freak accident. I hope others at
the school feel the same way. A
16-year-old girl is dead, she will
never graduate from high school,
nor will she attendeher senior

with a crown on his head, marches
in cap and gown with the rest of
his class, goes to school every
day, and my guess is that the guy
will have ‘a graduation party
before he canworry about get-
ting carted off to jail. Why not?
This kid needs all thesupport he
can get? I mean, is he so upset
over this that he can't function in

school, he’s losing sleep,‘ and is V

seeing a psychiatrist for his deep
depression? Of course he needs a
graduation party for support. I
guess his friends can still say
congratulations, but rather than

“good luck,” they can tell him to

cover his ass.

Collecting the,,.an1,,t_i,s,ement tax is not particularly amusing

The city of Pittsburgh has grown
considerably in the 18 years that
I have lived here. I can remember
the ‘hoopla over Renaissance II
and the beautiﬁcation of our
skyline. However, as a city grows
in size, there is equal opportunity
for other aspects to grow as well,
such as the arts and entertain-
ment. These are the qualities that
draw people here.

Pittsburgh's 10 percent amuse-
ment tax is a hindrance to the
growth of entertainment and the
arts in Pittsburgh. The announce-
ment last week that the Civic
Arena had lost its bid for the Big
East-Atlantic Coast Conference

college basketball series once
again stirred up discussion of the
tax. The struggle between the
city officials who are supporting
it and the promoters who are
shunning it continues. The city
expects to receive $7.5 million to
$8 million from the tax just in
1989.

 

The tax is appealing to city of-
ficials because most of it comes

, from people who live outside the

city and therefore does not di-
rectly affect Pittsburghers. What
they fail to see is that this tax is
keeping many well-regarded arts
and entertainment acts from our
city. This prevents us from being
competitive with other cities that
have a broader cultural scene.
Promoters, since the concep-
tion of the amusement tax in
1958, have argued that it is the
reason so "many rock concerts,
wrestling matches and perform-
ing artists have chosen not to
come to Pittsburgh. In fact, the
Post-Gazette reports that Pitts-
burgh's amusement tax‘ is the

highest in the country. Turner.

counters by saying that there may
have been some “isolated” cases,
but promoters use the tax as an
excuse. Why then, Mr. Turner,
have 46 cultural organizations
formed the Pittsburgh Arts Advo-
cacy Council, with an objective
of lobbying against this tax? One’
member of this group is the es-

tablished ‘non-proﬁt Civic Light '

Opera, which paid over $200,000
in amusement tax last year.
Those of us who want to extin-
guish this tax are faced with a
difficult challenge. I cannot_dis-

THE PITT NEWS

Wednesday, June 14, l989

The sordid true confessions of a liberal newspaper

it’s all Michael Dukakis’ fault.

When the Massachusetts gov-
ernor campaigned for the presi-
dency last year, the editorial staff
of The Pitt News supported his
efforts, much like many newspa-
pers around the country did at
the time.

With our endorsement came
many columns on the Perspec-
tive page that were pro-Dukakis,
perhaps even anti-George Bush.
Readers sent in letter upon letter
denouncing our endorsement and
follow-up pieces. Suddenly, our
readers told us, ThePittNews was
the most liberal publication ever

i produced.

We were defined. We were
liberals all along and didn’t even
realize it. p

The winter passed, and we
soon became used to the liberal
tag. It was sort of like a trusty
friend, there when you needed
him'(or her). Should someone
ask you what your political be-
liefs were, you could simply say,
“I write for The Pitt News.” That
would suffice.

So as we headed into our
summer editions, the entire staff
was well aware that, yes, they
were indeed liberal. Then one
day, as we were tie—dyeing our
staff T —shirts, we received a letter

NATO summit gives George Bush his day in the sun

Well, it appears as though the
administration that '-was “going
nowhere” has gone somewhere.
President Bush’s caution and
patience have been rewarded at
the 40th,NATO summit meeting
in Brussels.

Whether or not the “Bush-bash-
ers” want to admit it, Bush has
not only reached a historical
agreement with the Soviet Un-
ion, but has also pulled off one of
the slickest and most promising
moves in the history of the Cold
War.’

 

Additionally, and unfortunately
all too important, the president is
now winning the public-relations
battle over Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev. This will delight the
media’s armchair-presidents and

from one of our readers that
shook us to our very founda-
tions. It accused us of being...
conservative.

When the initial shock wore
off, we realized that perhaps this
reader was correct. After all, the
editorial cartoonist was sporting
his spanking new mint-green
Ralph Lauren polo shirt,,the copy
editor had a glossy of Ronald
Reagan in his wallet, and the
managing editor had just traded
in her snubnose .38 and AK-47
assault riﬂe for four tickets to the
next Lee Atwater gig.

First liberal. Now, conserva-
tive. We’re thinking about en-
dorsing the Libertarian candidate
in 1992, whoever he is.

Funny how we can be accused
of being liberal and conservative
at the same time. After all, this is
a liberal world. Or is it ‘conserva-
tive?

We don’t know. And that’s the
point. ThePittNewsis not here to
dictate beliefs to our readership.
Our job is simply to report the

_ facts, and we do that pretty well.

Apparently, that is not the way
many people would have this
newspaper run. Letters we’ve
received have shown disbelief at
how we twist facts in our articles
and columns to make them sen-

other global pea—brains who deem
such idiotic things important —
basically, this may give the presi-
dent some well-deserved, posi-
tive publicity from the press. .
Most crucial, though, is what
his major proposals offer: The
first proposal involves an equal
reduction and subsequent de-
struction of tanks and armored
vehicles from both NATO and
Warsaw Pact nations. Similar
action will be taken with artillery
(there are different deﬁnitions of
this category that must be re-
solved before any . exact deci-
sions on numbers can be made).
Second, each side would reduce
capability to 15 percent below

the current NATO levels of attack

and assault helicopters and all
land-based combat aircraft-— also
destroying the anus in question.
Finally, and most signiﬁcantly,
Bush has gained support from all
16 NATO allies in his proposal to
reduce U.S. and Soviet troop
presence , to approximately
275,000 men each. This last pro-

The anguishes of an

-Ahhh, it’s going to be a long
summer! _

Yes, that’s right, never fear,
summer weather is ﬁnally here!
And along with all the heat,
humidity and bugs come the long,
grueling days filled with blood,
sweat and tears.

What could be harder than
the very ﬁrst challenge we face

Many letters from out-of- staters
who happened to pick up a copy
of our paper while passing

through Pittsburgh have ﬁts over .

the state of The Pitt News. The
essence of these letters states that
we don’t write enough about
Elvis sightings, UFOs in New
Mexico and Bigfoot encounters
in Montana.

Sorry.

The Pitt News prides. itself on
fair, accurate and relevant report-

 

ing in the news, sports and enter-
tainment sections. The Perspec-
tive page is reserved for the opin-

ions of the staff and contributing I

columnists. Only the unsigned
editorial, which appears in every
issue, is the voice of the editorial
board. All columns are submitted
as single opinions and do not
necessarily represent the view-
points of the entire staff.

To be labeled liberal because
we endorsed Dukakis is a some-
what twisted, but fair representa-

posal is stunning in that it hasn’t
encountered Soviet rejection
(Gorbachev doesn’t. want to
appear unfriendly). It cuts only

about 35,000 US. troops while at V

the, same time reducing the So-
viet presence by nearly 325,000
—— a drastic and shocking reduc-
tion in Cold War terms.
Gorbachev and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl were
winning the hearts of the world
(and thus the public-relations
battle over Bush) by offering a
reduction of 500 short-range
missiles by both NATO and the
Soviet Union. Nearly all West
German polls indicated that the
people strongly advocated some
type of nuclear reduction of the
NATO missiles which are on their
soil, but an even higher percent-
age supported a reduction of U.S.
troops who practice routines in
the back yards of many West
German citizens. Kohl, a smart
chancellor seeking re-election,
thus supported Gorbachev’s of-
fer. Now the idea sounds won-

overwhelmed with all of the
obstacles I must face before the

called upon to prepare a frozen
dinner, do the dishes, or (it’s too
horrible to say) look for gainful
employment.

In addition to all of this, on
sunny days, I may even manage
to squeeze in a little sunbathing.
"Many people marvel at how I am
able to ﬁt this in to such a full and

 
   

tion of the paper. To be labeled
conservative because of an anti-
Noriega column is not.

Nor is The Pitt News any more
university-affiliated than the
Oakland post office, as some
readers apparently believe. We
do not receive direct funds from
the student activities fee as we
did in the past, and as most
college papers still do today. We
cannot be censored by the uni-
versity. No one pulls our strings.

Unlike many universities, Pitt
does not have a journalism pro-

gram for writing majors to follow. ,
The Pitt News serves "as the train-

ing ground for prospective jour-
nalists at the university. Without
a disciplined program, writers
have to essentially train them-
selves, sometimes through trial
and error.
That is why, at times,’ we miss
a story that may be of interest to
our readership. That is why we
sometimes unknowingly omit
pieces of information that could
be vital to our readers.
As a newspaper, those are errors
that should not take place. We
take no solace in the fact that we
are a college newspaper, and
that mistakes may be forgiven.
We strive to be professional,
and as such, produce a profes-

derful, but the truth is that it

would only benefit the Soviet

Union. There are currently 1,400

short-range missiles on the NATO

side. These missiles are needed
for stability in the event of a
Soviet attack. Gorbachev and
Kohl wanted both sides to re-
duce the number of their missiles
by 500. That might be ﬁne, but
the problem is that the Soviet
Union currently possesses nearly
10,000 of the same missiles —
that type of asymmetry won’t do
much for detente. Basically, the
only side that would beneﬁt from
this proposal would be the Soviet
Union. ’ -

But it appeared as though Gor-
bachev was a peace-seeker and
Bush, by refusing the proposal, a,
war-monger. Consequently, at
this summit meeting, the pres-
sure was on Bush to create some

type of proposal that would make _
him the peace-seeker, without "

reducing the number of missiles.

Hamlet is brilliant. If

your stay at this university, be
sure it is Hamlet.

Because the play itself is
so incredible, it is difficult to
imagine that a production of .
Hamlet would be less than
magniﬁcent. But “the Three

production is more than
magniﬁcent.

Credit for this perform-
ance goes to its cast, its direc-
tor (Gillette A. Elvgren) and
William Shakespeare, of 1
course. But the single greatest
reason for this play’s success

— is the talent of Richard McMil-

Field-general Dickerson now K.C. royalty

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Pitt quarterback Darnell Dickerson is
practicing his throwing, catching, hitting
and running this summer.

He’s not hitting tackling dummies or
running to end zones, like most football
players do at practice. In fact, he’s not
even throwing or catching footballs.

Instead, he’s throwing, catching and
hitting baseballs, and he’s running around
bases.

Only weeks after Dickerson was

declared academically ineligible to play
football for the Panthers in 1989, the
Kansas City Royals chose him in the 28th
round of the major league baseball draft.

Dickerson signed a bonus contract
with the Royals and is now playing class

_ A baseball in the Gulf Coast League.

It’s been three years since‘ Dickerson
has played organized baseball. The last
time he played was when he was the

strong-armed catcher for Martin Luther

King High School in Detroit.
The director of scouting for the Roy-
als, Art Stewart, has high hopes for Dick-

erson’s baseball career.

“His chances to make it in the big
leagues are very good if he devotes his full
time and works hard at it," said Stewart
“His being drafted indicates a lot about his
athletic ability and talent.”

Dickerson’s athletic ability is the main
reason the Royals chose him, according to
Stewart.

“He showed us an outstanding amount
of ability out of high school,” said Stewart.
“We feel he could still play baseball, even
though he devoted his last few years to
football. He’s such a great athlete, and

with his baseball history, we have a lot of
conﬁdence in Darnell.”

Dickerson is eligible to return to Pitt
this year to continue his education. If he
returns to Pitt and improves his grades he
could play football again for the Panthers
in 1990.

Stewart also commented on the Roy-
als’ opinion of that option.

“Our philosophy has always been that
[people] should get their education, then
pursue a career,” said Stewart

Little League creates handicapped divisiotle

WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) —

‘Little League Baseball will open

its program to the physically and
mentally disabled with a new
“Challenger Division” and will
also install a drug and alcohol
abuse prevention program next
year. .

The announcement of the
two new programs was made
Tuesday during the -youth base-
ball organization’s 18th interna-
tional congress. The congress was
attended by over 400 delegates
from the United States and other
countries, including China, which
participate in Little League.

“This could be the most
exciting decision in Little League
since its inception,” congress
Chairman Timothy Hughes told
the delegates.

Hughes said the Challenger
Division comes as a result of
various leagues, most notably in
Massachusetts and Texas, start-
ing programs for the disabled on

“It gives an opportunity for a
new group of people to enjoy the
beneﬁts of Little League who
never could before," he said.

“Little League is not just a bat
and a ball. It’s not a score show-
ing a loser. It extends beyond
that because of our concern for
the well—being of the children,
including the disabled,” said
Creighton J. Hale, Little League
president and chief executive
officer.

Sen. Robert Dole, who is
handicapped from war injuries in
Vietnam,’ was put in charge of a

task force to get the new division -

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, June 14, 1989

 

By Sull Sussman
Associated Press Writer

TORONTO (AP) - Ben
Johnson yesterday admitted
cheating and lying about steroids
at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, then
appealed for a chance to com-
pete again for Canada.

“I want to tell them to be
honest, don’t take drugs,” the
sprinter said of a message he
wants to carry to youth. “I’ve
been there. I know what it’s like
to cheat. ”_

Johnson told a Canadian
inquiry into drugs and athletics
that he usedsteroids for at least
seven years before his Olympic
disgrace. He said he lied about it
until now because he was em-
barrassed.

“I was ashamed for my fam-
ily and friends,” he said, conclud-
ing his direct testimony and brief
cross-examination from his own
lawyer. “It was just a mess.”

The sprinter said he wanted
to compete for Canada in the

journey, more than an exercise in
nostalgia.

He is not preparing for the
seniors tour, but rather still has
designs on golfs major champi-
onships and has talked of com-
peteing in the U.S. and British
Opens, the Masters and PGA for
another three or four years. ‘J

.“I’1l grind very hard in this
tournament to finish in the top
15, so I’ll qualify to come back
again next year. I’ll grind ‘it. I'd
love to finish in the top 15,”
Trevino said. ’

There is a “special feeling,"
‘Trevino said, about the return to
the site of his first triumph.

And he can recall, in detail,
the highlights of that victory, in-
cluding a 35-foot putt that pro-
duced a birdie and a two—shot
lead on the 11tl1 hole of the final
round and the march up the 18th
fairway with a four-stroke lead.

But at least two other tourna-
ments stand out more, he said.

One was the U.S. Open of the
preceeding year, 1967, at Baltus-
trol. Trevino finished ﬁfth and,
for the first time, “thought maybe
I could play with these-guys.”

The other was the Hawaiian
Open late in 1968, after his vic-
tory at Oak hill.

“Somebody, I don’t know who
it was, Walter Hagan or Gene
Sarazen or somebody years ago,
said anybody can win a U.S.
Open, but it takes a hell of a good
player to win two," Trevino said

“I don’t think I got my credi-
bility until I won my second
tournament, in Hawaii. '

“I wouldn't trade a U.S. Open
for any golf tournament I ever
won. No question about it. ButI
got more satisfaction out of win-
ning Hawaii than anything.

 

   

1992 Olympics. Asked if he could
be the fastest without drugs,
Johnson replied: “I know I can
be.”

The sprinter conﬁrmed that
he was given steroid injections
by his coach, Charlie Francis, on
Aug. 24, and personal physician

. Dr. Jamie Astaphan last Aug. 25

and 28 before the Olympics.

Johnson said he took no
substances on his own between
then and the Sept. 24 100-meter
race at Seoul.

He forfeited his 9.79-second
performance that bested his own
world record and the Olympic
gold medal because of a positive
test for the anabolic steroid stano-
zolol.

_ Johnson also said that he did
not drink a honey and vinegar
beverage that Astaphan sent to
him the day of the race.

Although there had been
speculation that Astaphan was
trying to mask the most recent

Johnson admits steroid use

steroid injections, the doctor
denied that it was anything other
than an energy drink during his
testimony.

Johnson said he returned to
Canada immediately from Seoul
after returning his gold medal
because he was concerned about
the security of his family. “I
wanted to get them out of there
quickly,” he said.

He ‘gave an interview to the
Toronto Sun on returning to
Canada and a statement pub-
lished Oct. 1 in which he said he
was innocent. Johnson also re-
peated that he never knowingly
used illegal drugs at an early
October news conference in
Toronto.

Journalists who were able to
get close-up views of Johnson
during his second day of testi-
mony to the federal drug inquiry
said there were tears in his eyes
at the morning session.
