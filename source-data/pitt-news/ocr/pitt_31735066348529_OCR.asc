resources. But the Congressman
insisted this would be done with a
“careful eye on the environmental
consequences."

As an example, Moorhead points
out there are techniques of con-
verting oil shale to usable energy,
and that deposits could be devel-
oped in certain areas of Colorado.
However, he said the process
“could use up all of the water in the
Colorado River and destroy it.
There would have to be a very
serious need for energy before that
idea was even considered.”

Besides the short range of super-
vising ecologically sound develop-
ment of energy sources, Moorhead
envisions a long term plan to rid

the US of dependence on foreign oil 7

supplies. I
« “In the longer run,”- he said “the

Subcommittee intends to oversee
_ /

the development of new environ-
mentally safe energy and material
resources and technologies which
will insulate the nation from the
vagaries of international cartels.”

According to the Congressman,

Pennsylvania will play a vital role .

in alleviating the country’s energy
problems. 5

In particular, he feels the st_ate’s
coal deposits will be most valuable.
“I have a great hopeufor coal. In
the short run, it is probably the
best and biggest alternate source of
energy,” Moorhead stated.‘

But coal is not the only reasonthe
Congressman thinks his home state
will figure into the plans of his

head pointed out. “All have a past,

Pochapin was chosen ‘fto fill the

decided which group will be the
legal bargaining agent.

“It would be an unfair labor
practice on our part to meet with a
group as yet unrecognized as the
official bargaining agent-—we are
constrained by the PLRB from

_/-¥:}_ing so. We are glad to meed with

studciits. Unless they represent
themselves as concerned students
we cannot negotiate the contract
with them," Powers said yester-
day.

According to Powers, the health
insurance contract came out of last
year’s Student Health‘ Care Pro-
gram Committee--which includes
six student representatives--
charged with choosing the policy.
The committee, according to
Powers, is the proper avenue for
changing the contract.

The insurance policy stipulates a
policy holder must pay the first
$100 of major medical expenses he

’ _‘:_,.,:ives outside the Student Health

Service.

Prudent Student

The Graduate Employees Division
of the PPU charges the University
with refusing to recognize the
employee status of the TA‘s, TF's
and research assistants, thus
denying them an employee's right

' to collective bargaining for bene-

fits.

“The University is stalling on
giving us an election. Give us an
election for grad students--we
know we’ll win it,” said the PPU’s
McColloch.

According to Powers, the Gradu-
ate Employees Division of the PPU
is not yet an effective bargaining
agent. The group, according to
Powers, is not primarily employ-
ees, but students.

About 20 picketers moved to the
Chancellor's Cathedral office at 1
pin, requesting an appointment to
renegotiate the Health Care Plan
after airing their side.

“lT’s‘ pretty clear they’re not
going to make an appointment.
That’s what we expected,” McCol-
lock said upon learning the

ism by faculty was also discussed.

“My job is not to make
judgements on students, but to
cause them to grow as fully as they
can, and I have very, very high
standards ‘on those accounts,”
Marshall said. The problem is a

' national one, he said, where the

average QPA at universities is 3.5.

hotel-and-apartment complex.

“If they (St. Paul’s) really want a
park or an open space across from
them, they should be willing to
lease the land,” Van Horn said.

The land is now used mostly for

parking. CMU considers such
usage unsightly and marginal
economically.

In several public hearings on land
use policy for the area, Van Horn

and others argued the hotel project
would benefit the Oakland com-
munity.

Opponents, including St. Paul’s,
Webster Hall Hotel and the
Constantin auto repair garage, said
the project would cause increased
traffic congestion, overcommer-
cialization and other problems.

Approval by City Council of the
commission’s recommendation
could pave the way for high rise
apartment or condominium devel-

opment.

However, Van Horn said studies
indicate there is no market for new
apartments in Oakland and CMU
does not plan to allow condomin-
ium development because the
school wants to retain ownership of
the land in case it is needed for
future university expansion.

He said CMU will continue using
the land for parking until City
Council makes a decision and
alternative usages can be explored.

Student Aide Kenneth Wagner
compared last year’s admissions
data with data from 1964 when Pitt
was a private university. He said
SAT scores had gone down, but
65% of Pitt’s admissions were in
the top ﬁfth of their class compared
with 60% in 1964.

. Wagner said he felt Pitt has an

image problem. “Our image of
ourselves is different than the way
others perceive us. There is an
image people have of a state-re-
lated university, but there is no
difference between Pitt and 90% of
private universities around the
country.”

The faculty also discussed how to
attract students to Pitt, and how to
make faculty and facilities known to
students.

. FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg said
the question of whether to allow up
to 12 credits for advanced ROTC
courses in CA5 will be put on the
FAS Council agenda. He said
currently, 12 non-CAS credits are
allowed for graduation.

An Exercise in Futility »

Last Friday’s protest of the Chancellor’s refusal to meet with the
graduate employee unit of the PPU over current and future health
insurance plans was nothing more than an exercise in futility.

Unfortunately, Friday’s protest was a clear case of misdirected
-energy. Picketing the Chancellor's office had the potential to stir‘a lot
of heated feelings, and that is all. .

Those students involved in thevprotest could have put that time and
energy to much better use by going to the. source of the health Care
plan -- the Student Health Care Program Committee.

the picketers identiﬁed themselves as a branch of the PPU. The
administration, with the support of Sidney Lawrence, Pemtsylvania
Labor Relations Board Hearing Examiner, argues that an unfair labor
practice charge would be the immediate result of any negotiation with a
group petitioning to become the bargaining unit for Pitt employees.

Further, leaders of the protesting group had been informed of this
situation through a letter from the Chancellor's office almost two weeks

, ago, according to Powers. And since that time, no organized attempt-
-has been made to contact or inﬂuence the Student Health Care

  

Program Committee.

Theineglect of this avenue of constructive actionraises the ugly
that Ih:iday’s picketers considered the health insurance

needsofPitt’sgraduatestudwtsmerelyanexcuseforpublicizingthe

 .‘air'mandcapabilitiesoft:heirpotaitialbargainingunit.

Going through proper channels may be a tired phrase which hides a
lot of bureaucratic red tape, but in this case, there is no justification for
ignoring such an accessable and useful tool as the health care

committee. , ‘

»  It is especially important for Pitt graduate'students to realize that the

issue of teaching assistants and fellows’ unionizing aims should not be

- confused with the need to take action on the health care plan. Using the

potential of the PPU to confront the Chancellor is not the best
application of power in this case, and dwelling on thisapproach will be

doing all graduate students a vital disservice.

A Complaints Equal

A ‘Hassles’ at Pitt

To the Editor,
As a full-time undergraduate
student, I am personally incensed

- by a statement in the Pitt News of

February 12, 1975. Wendy Traub
is quoted as saying, in reference to
Ronald Ziegler, “We really wanted

_ V ,to bring him in. Mostly because of

2*  "all the. hassles it’s created so far.”
' .By “hassles,” I assume she is 0'
referring in part to the large

number of complaints on behalf of
those of us who object’ to the
decision to use our money to
support this person. That there is
dissent surrounding the issue is
.-apparent, I think, to those people in
the University who care to be aware
of it. '

'- Irealizethat the University is not
‘ a democracy, that we are not asked

where our money should go and
that I, for one, have decided to
expend my energies in a less
frustrating and more personally
valuable struggle outside the
University. I do, however, deeply
resent the attitude that our
complaints are merely “hassles” to
be pushed away, or, in fact, to be
used to justify the University's
complicty in the proﬁt-making of
 patizcular individual.

Greeks Applaudi
Pitt News Efforts

_Dear Editor.

We were particularly surprised
and delighted when we read this
Wednesday's edition of the Pitt
News. It contained, among other

things, three separate articles deal- '

ing with the Greeks at Pitt and their
efforts in raising a projected
$25,000 to $50,000 for the Western
Pennsylvania Heart Association.
As members of the Greek system,
we feel that in the past the Pitt
News has not been representative
of our interests and has‘ not taken
into accountithe contributions to
campus activities and social life the
Greek system has made at Pitt. We
appreciate your recognition of our
present efforts in the worthwhile
project we are now involved in.

Our organizations generally take
strong pride in our names and
traditions and we hope that when
you cover our activities in the
future, you print our names cor.
rectly. The girl who won the
women’s category of the ice cream
eating contest was from Sigma
Delta Tau Sorority (not Sigma Tau
Delta) and the fraternity planning
the bike race is Pi Kappa Alpha
(not Phi Kappa Alpha).

We have also noticed an increase

. SGB From The Socialist Side

BY MARK SATINOFF '

Because I ran for Student Govern-
ment Board on the Young Socialist
platform. Pitt students may wonder
how this will affect my actions on
the Board. Briefly, Iintend to work
for the ideas contained in the
Young Socialist platform: 1) no
tuition hikes--no aid cutbacks, 2)
black control of Black Studies, 3)
an end to sex discrimination, 4) full
union rights for Pitt employees, 5)
no credit for _ROTC and 6)
democratization of Student Gov-
ernment. , ~

As the Young Socialist’ platform
stated: “The problems of society
are reflected within the University
community in a variety of ways,
and the Student Government has
the responsibility to give special.
attention to the way in which they
affect our campus.” I think’ this
provides’ a useful set of guidlines
for dealing with major problems
facing the University. Two contro-
versies which have come up since
the election will help to illustrate
my approach. ,

Once again the administration is
increasing the already exorbitant
price of room and board at Pitt.
Students are told that the costs of
utilities, labor and foo_d have gone
up.

Insofar as inﬂation is affecting the
University, students are certainly
not the ones to blame and should.
not havepto bear the burden of
these increased costs. The prob-
lem goes much deeper than paying
union-scale wages to Szabo em-
ployees, _as certain University ad-
ministrators have claimed. Stu-
dents, in conjunction with faculty
and‘ community ~ representatives,‘
should have the right to determine
the allocation of funds.

The first step in that direction is to

have access to the income and r

expense ledgers of the University,
otherwise known as “level one”
budgets. In addition, the Univer-
sity should seek further federal
funds rather than hiking tuition.

 Letters to the

coverage in the Pitt News. A
cut-back in the number of AP wire
stories, stronger coverage of cam-
pus activities and mention of the
Greek Week Charity Drive have
increased the quality and relevance
of your publication and we com-
mend your efforts.

Sincerely, ’
Bob Watson, CAS 75

Poorly Organized
Verbal Garbage

To the editor, ,

It has been my dismay for the past
year to see featured in your
publication a series of editorials by
your arts editor, Jess M. Brallier.
From his first article in September
up to his most recent article in
February, I have read nothing but
the most poorly organized and
‘inaccessible verbiage/ garbage in
the column entitled “Thoughts at
Small.” I don’t wish to argue
specifics but I have a few general
comments that I would like to
make.

First of all, I think that in many
instances, Mr. Brallier’s use of
English grammar should have
found its place in the trash can
rather than in the Pitt News, unless
you consider these receptacles
one-in-the-same. ‘Secondly, “Mr.

: ’1‘.‘,‘

The annual war budget of the
government is $94 billion, while
schools and hospitals are left
ﬁghting each other over spare
change.

Another recent controversy con-
cerns the invitation extended to
Ronald Ziegler by the program-
ming committee to speak at Pitt for
$2,500. Because he played a major
part in Watergate and its coverup,
the majority of people see him for
what he is--a liar and a crook. I
stand opposed to rewarding him for
his criminal activities. The Student
Government Board should go on
record in opposition to this pay-
ment, and I will introduce a motion
to that effect.

These are just two examples of
how the Socialist program can be

applied to the problems facing Pitt ,

students. The Student Govern-
ment Board acting by itself cannot
implement the many important
changes which need to take place.
The power of change does not lie in
the seven members of the Student
Government Board, nor even the
various committees which provide
the facade of student control.’ For
example, the Allocations Com-
mittee--which is chosen by and
composed of students for the
purpose of allocating student funds
to pay for student activities--is
subject to administrative _veto.
The opening paragraph of the
Allocations Committee’s bylaws
states, “The Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs retains final ap-
proval in the allocation of funds.”

To add insult to injury, it further ’

states, “Upon use of a veto, he
will...when appropriate, make pub-
lie the reasons for the action.”
Furthermore, closed’-door nego-
tiations between selected students
and the administration are un-
democratic and lead to deadend
deals. Meetings in which the
Student Government Board is in-
volved must be "open to all stu-

_ dents.

The real power of Student Gov-

Brallier’s hostile feelings toward
certain unseen enemies of the arts
have not only seemed unwarranted
but have helped tofurther alienate
his reading audience. Thirdly, I
think it atrocious to take these
unseen foes and stereotype them
out of humanity, placing his
position of arts editor abovemores
and -morals. And last but not least,’
Iifind it totally ludicrous that once
having cursed out these trans-
gressors of the Brallian code, he
admits to having no authority for

ernment lies in its ability to use the

facilities available to it to educate

and mobilize students around con-
crete issues. Student Government
is-a vehicle through which students

can fight back against attacks (_)_.LFR}_,...«. 

our right to education. _
This was recently demonstrated in
New York City. Threatened with a
$17 million cut in the university
budget and the eliminations of
open admissions, 2,000 students
and faculty successfully rallied at
City Hall demanding, “Stop the
cutbacks!” The demonstration was

—co-sponsored by the University

Student Senate, a city-wide body of
student government representa-
tives, and the Professional Staff _
Congress, a union representing the

City University of New York fac- ‘

ulty. This example is particularly
applicable to Pitt since the Budget

Policies Committee of the UniV'é?: ~ . V

sity Senate is already, making
preparations for a tuition increase
in the 

This type of orientation, which
relates Pitt problems to larger
social issues, should guide the

. actions of the Student Government

Board. A step in the right direction
was taken when the Student Gov-
ernment Board endorsed the Na-
tional Student Conference -Against
Racism, and made the student
government offices available as a
local coordinating center. This

social consciousness should con- _

tinue, and deepen, in building for

the May '17 national march agains_t};__,,_ 
-racism, to take place in Boston,

In short, I am a socialist Student
Government Board member. I

-believe that our economic, political

and educational institutions should

' be under democratic, majority con-

trol, used to meet the needs of all
people in society and not to make

proﬁts for corporations. From this _
standpoint, I.will continue to speakgwie

out on the issues that affect
students and be in the forefront of

’struggles‘ to change the deteriora-

ting conditions which face us all. .

“There’s no    
such thing as a
free lunch.”  

lt’s a dull term, but something called the
»“pub|lc debt” has been piling up for years

because our tax dollars haven't come close to

paying for all of the services andprograms we've
been demanding. In fact, just the annual
interest charge on this debt recently-hit a cool
$29 billion. Nevertheless, many politicians say,
“Relax, Uncle Sam can simply print the money
to cover the cost.” Not so, as this story from
The March Reader's Digest makes clear. For
with skyrocketing prices people stopped
buying. And now we've got recession. [How to
get out of the mess? Read on  .

VER wonder why you
feel poorer’ even though
you’re probably mak-
'ing more money than
y your fath_er ever
dreamed-of? You ﬁnally bought that
house. You drive a nice car. Maybe

 
 

you’re making payments on that-

boat you always wanted. But’ why
did that new tile in the kitchen cost

‘ so much more than you expected?

Why did thegbill for that washing-

machine service call take your breath
away? Why do expenses now seem
to exceed income?

There is an easy one-word answer,
' to all these questions—inﬂation. But
do we really understand what inﬂa- v

tion is, and why this “secret taxi’
keeps chipping away at our pay-
checks?

Many factors have exacerbated
this dollar-dissolving inﬂation—th_c
-energy crisis, crop prices, exces-
sive and ill-advised government
regulation, wages outrunning pro-
ductivity. But the basic cause of in-
ﬂation is one that most Americans
seem largely unaware of :» spending
money that hasn't been ‘earned yet.

In short, inﬂation is the creature
of debt, and the most "inﬂationary
kind of debt is the one we——under

our democratic - system—are the

most responsible for :»the public debt.

The ‘officials we elect run up'this ._ 
debt to provide the loans, goods, 
services and programs that we have
come to believe should be “paid for ,

by government.”
' We forget, of course, that “paid for
by government” means paid for by

3 us, Government may print money,
but this is only the symbol of wealth.
Real wealth is the value of the goods
and services produced by working
men and women. It is their pay for
making cars, houses, clothes, books,
furniture and all the other myriad
things we are accustomed to. Gov-

that we create, and takes from each
of us a portion of it through taxes
and other revenues.

Last year we paid out $255.4 bil-

‘ lion inhfederal taxes. Unfortunately,
the government not only spent all
this money; it kept right on spend-
ing, doling out $3.5 billion more than
we gave’ it. And “it- has generally

_done the same, for years—spending
$66.8 billion more than income in
the ﬁve years 1970 through 1974

“alone. -

That is where the trouble starts
—when we, as electors, allow gov-
ernment, often for individually per-
suasive reasons, to spend dollars it
doesn’t have. It goes into debt.

But government and theaverage
citizen go into debt under diﬂerent
rules. Government is the dominant
borrower in the market, both from
individuals (mainly through selling
savings bonds) and by depositing
IOUs with banks, then writing
checks against them. Result: We tax,-
payers have to pay various banks and
other lenders some $29 billion in
yearly interest on the public debt.

And that’s why we are in trouble.
We pay all the government’s bills,
and we bear the burden of those bills

ernment depends upon this wealth .

ADVERTISEMENT

government incurs after our tax
money has run out. We pay by shell-
ing out that secret tax that adds ten
cents to a pound of ‘bacon, $5 to a
pair of shoes, $20 to an electric stove.

Now this is the part of inﬂation
that most of us don’t fully under-
stand: How the government’s in-

debtedness pushes up'the prices of

the things we buy.

It works this way: We can’t print
money to cover our own debts. The
federal government, however, can;
through a complex procedure called

“monetary'policy,” the Federal Re»

serve creates dollars and transfers
them to banks. The banks make
loans from these new “assets.” Thus,
money is “pumped into the econo-
my”—money that was originally
nothing more than the ﬁgures on a
Federal Reserve check; soon more
currency has to be printed to cover

the new dollars. Many of these dol-H

lars originate through bank loans of
various kinds. They ﬁnd their way
into..the economy through various
commercial transactions. But who

has established the need for these
new dollars in the first place? We _

have—through the many things we
ask government to “do” for us;
through loans and grants to busi-
nesses, schools, research groups;
through “aid” programs of all kinds.
Remember, most of these deﬁcit
dollars have not been earned by pro-
ducing anything. They merely com-
pete with our paycheck dollars_ for
whatever goods and services we and

-others have produced. Result: The

oldest of economic laws takes eﬂect.

With more money around than _
- available goods, prices rise—and in-

ﬂation is upon us. _

Okay. Everybody talks about it.
Almost everybody feels it. But what
can we do about it?

Certainly, increased productivity
—each of us producing more forithe
dollars we earn—is_ one of the most
effective counters to inﬂation. Many
businesses and dedicated workers
have performed amazing feats of
productivity,‘ enabling them to in-
crease their wages and proﬁts while

cutting the price of their products to

remain competitive.*
‘But productivity increases cannot

that will not be made unless citizens
—businessmen, farmers, workers,
housewives, pensio_ners—demand
them and are willing to accept the
sacriﬁces that must be made.
Particularly in times such as these,
no one would deny the use of federal
resources totake care of the truly
needy. And to alleviate the rigors
of recession, job programs and other
relief may well be essential. But
with additional costs, it is even more
imperative that the "rest of the budget

The 99¢ Floating Theatre

THE PAST

BY HARRIS LEVY

Bill Vanaver ande Livia- Drapkin
like to share. That’s what— made

‘ their performances a month ago, so
sorry for the delay, for the
Pittsburgh 99 Cent Floating Thea-
litre Festival special. Audiences

,_ pi/‘f\_ga_£y responded to their engaging

repertoire of ‘songs and dances
culled from many countries.

Bill plays an incredible variety of
instruments. Not just guitar and
rbanjo, but an assortment of string
instruments gathered from foreign
cultures.

Livia dances. Her gracefulness
complements Bill's versatility--and
each is not restricted to their
specialty. Bill joins in on some
traditional dances and Livia sings

and plays much of the time.

Bill and Livia combine dance and
music into a concert that combines
the best aspects "of both arts_, a

show that demonstrates that each
art form
separate but a different facet of the

. creative expression of‘ feelings.
 alone would make Bill and
TLivia_ unique. But what really
transformed their act from a
concert into an .evening truly

shared by performers and audience A

was their attitude.” _
“The main thing is to have fun,”
Livia said after the. show. Bill and

_Livia really get involved with their"

audiences--many performers will
.lead crowds in clapping and

A, singing along. And most times the T

«.5,-xidiences are apathetic. V
\ However, the audience for Bill
and Livia participated actively. The
artists showed their respect for the
concert-goers by letting them in on
some complicated clapping rhy-
thms and singing. If the audience

didn’t respond right away, Bill and-

Livia kept working atit. “Now that

sections on‘ population, pollution,
consumption, and transformation.
Snyder writes that “our won
heads” are the ‘crux of the solution;
“...at the heart of things is some
kind of serene and ecstatic process
which is beyond qualities and
beyond birth-and-death.”

Turtle Island is remarkable for its

blend of the topical and the.

ageless, hard facts and enchanting
visions, lyrical poetry and clear
prose. '

Like Turtle Island, the first
collection of Hermann Hesse’s
poetry is uniﬁed by a theme.
Poet/ translator James Wright has
chosen a small selection of poems
about homesickness from the 480
pages of poetry by the famous
novelist. - '

The poems, accompanied by the
original German texts, are some-
times maudlin. But as Wright
notes, if Hesse didn’t have the
answer, he knew how to ask the
right question. A

“In our fury and muddle

We act like children, cut off,

Fled from ourselves,

Bound by silly shame.

For the many readers of Hesse’s
novels, these simple poems will be
appealing as another facet of the

The general
consensus is they can do a lot.

Despite the absence of four of the
team’s big men(Ch’uck Mozingo,
Rich Markley, Don Betterley and
Karl Farmer) the Cats didn’t falter
and dominated the field.

“We "could have deﬁnitely won
more events by using our stars,”
said a smiling Banner, “but these
youngkids deserved a chance to
compete and they did extremely
well. I would have to consider this
the ﬁnest young team I’ve coached
since the Bryan Salter and Jerry

Richey teams of the late sixties.”-

Although a team score wasn’t
kept, Pitt ‘Captured four first
places, three seconds and five

Jay Sharpley, although a sopho-
more, is rapidly developing into
one of the ﬁnest young hurdlers in

“My main idea of the race was to

«Sharpley. “He grabbed me at the ,

Invitationalfan occurence clearly
seen by many spectatorslpand this
has bothered me since. I had a
good start today and ran as hard as
I could. I’m glad I won, but beating
Burke was my only thought.”

In the 50 yard dash Willie Walker

“I’ve_ had’ a sore hamstring

University Park -- The Pitt
basketball team continued their hot
streak Saturday night in Penn
State’s Rec Hall by defeating the
Nittany Lions 76-69 in the third
meeting of the two teams this year.
The win gave the Cats a 2-1 edge
over the Lions for the season and
ran their record to 15-8.

The game was never really in
doubt as hapless Penn State
blundered every opportunity they
had to pull off an upset. Pitt never

Richards opened the contest with a
jump shot from 15 feet.

the squad of Terry Wile, Mel Boyd,

While the w_inning tradition was
kept alive at the Field House, the -

mile relay team “was in the Big
Apple (‘known to many as New

“Rich [Markley] did not run a

ﬁve of ﬁve ﬁeld goal attempts in
the ﬁrst few minutes as they easily
connected over the Lion zone
defense. ‘

Penn.State managed to close the -

gap with three -buckets from-
sophomore Chris Erichsen and
after ﬁve minutes of play Pitt held a
12-10 edge. _
But the Cats were shooting too
well for the Lions to take over the

lead. Their‘ 55 per cent field goal“

shooting enabled them to match
the Lions despite a first half deﬁcit
in rebounding [18-15] and the
Lions’ equally impressive 53
per cent from the field.

The ﬁrst half was primarily a
shooting contest between Pitt’s’
Kirk Bruce and State’s Erichsen.
Bruce was unstoppable, hitting
seven ofnine shots in the ﬁrst half
to lead all scoring with 14 points.
Erichsen managed a c_lose second
with 12 points yet his team
remained behind at the half ‘40-33.

The game was just about over at
that point. The Panthers spread the
lead to 11 in the ﬁrst minute of
the second frame with tworRichards
jump shots. After the Lions got the
score down to seven, 44-37, the two
teams went to tradingbaskets, and
two new, stars emerged in Lion
Kevin Burke and Pitt’s Keith Starr.

The lead fluctuated between nine
and seven points for nearly eight
minutes until Erichsen broke the
string midway through the half
with a -baseline shot cutting the
lead to five, 58-53.

At the time, it appeared as though
the Lions might make a late surge
as they did last year on their floor
to stop the Cats winning streak.
But the clumsey Lion squad threw
the ball away ‘as the Cats began to
build their lead again. Just three
minutes later, Pitt was up by ten
and they merely needed to play
deliberate basketball to come away
with the win.

  iivmnuisfs Split  
  VVeekencl Meets“

‘BY JIM SPANOS \

The weekend was a hectic one for
P_itt’s gymnastics team. Friday
night the Cats travelled to Slippery
Rock where they lost a four point
heartbreaker because of the Rock-
ets strength on the Vault and

,Horizontal bar. The Rocks out-
scored the Panthers 183 to 179, and
clinched the win by outdistancing
Pitt by four points on the
Horizontal bar, the ﬁnal event.

Saturday the Panthers not only 

had to deal with the Mountaineers
of West Virginia, but a new format
as well. Along with the two men’s
teams, the Pitt, WVU,_ and
Youngstown State women’s teams
had a meet as well, which made for
a hectic, albeit exciting afternoon

~ of gymnastics.

The meet began with Mark
Boyette scoring an 8.55 on the ﬂoor
exe’rcise, doing a back layout to a
double twist, -front step out into a
cartwheel side sommersault, and
ending with a pike. The meet was
Boyette’s last at home as a Pitt
gymnast. He is a graduating
senior.

Rob Pasterick then followed with
an 8.85. His, routine, except for
overshooting on his double-back,
was exceptional.

WVU tallied 27.5 on the ﬂoor,

. while the Panthers. grabbed 33

points to take an early lead.

Pitt then outscored the Mounties
on the horse, 30.4 to 29.7, sparked
by an 8.1 score by Gary. Wolf, Pitt’s

top performer on the. horse. . _.

$I.Vincent Cuts

BY STEVE SYBERT
P’ Jeff Saunders scored two goals
and ﬁve other Panthers contributed

if one apiece as the Pitt Hockey Club

rolled to a 7-3 victorv over St.
Vincent's Saturday at the Civic

Arena.
Saunders scored his 14th and 15th
goals and, for the second week in a

_ row, the game-winner. The sopho-

more center took a pass from
llnemate Chuck Crisanti and shot it
by Bearcat goalie Ken Glinka at
3:21 of the third period for a then
4-1 Pitt lead.

Saunders tallied his first goal on a
rebound from John Finney’s slap
shot from the blue-line early in the
second period.

Denny Browne opened up the
Panther scoring at the 10:23 mark
of the opening period by ﬂipping in
a 10-footer following a pass from
Rick Vernon. It was the only goal of
the period for the Cats who could
muster only eight shots on goal.

Pitt led 3-0 after two frames,
Saunders knocking in his second
tally with 2:15 gone and Val Troy
slamming one in just underneath
the crossbar from 30 feet out with a
minute remaining.

The Bearcats’ Dave Donatelli cut

A the lead to two with only 32 seconds"

gone in the third period, but
Saunders offset the goal with one of
his own three minutes later.

St. Vincent’s , though down 4-1
with ten minutes remaining, had
hopes of pulling off an upset when
Chris Carlton ﬂipped a close-in
shot by Johnny DeFazio to once
again narrow the margin.

and beating Glinka for his 36th
goal of the season and a 5-2
Panther lead. .

The Panthers then went to work
on Glinka who had to be tired from
holding down the Pitt attack as well
as he did. First Charlie Hagins
flipped one between his pads and
Bill Gedeon threw him a deke for
another easy goal.

At the 11:58 mark, Carlton added
his second goal of the game to close
the gap and give consolation to the
Bearcats who played well in a
losing effort.

PANTHER PUCKS: The Panthers
outshot the Bearcats 37-13...Pitt is
now 9-0 in the WPIHA and 14-2-1
overall.

It was the 18th straight league

consecutive game without a loss...
Camegie-Mellon regained second-
place with a 4-2 win over Duquesne

Paul Fischione and Dave Ruben-

Richards Sparks Cats

BY TOM HALL
What do‘ Rutgers, West Virginia,
and now Penn State share in
common? Well, it was the hot
shooting performances of Tom
Richards that did them in.
Saturday night at Penn State’s
Rec Hall, Richards was shooting
78% on nine field goal attempts,
totaling 16 points. His ball hawking
defense from the ‘point guard
position led to several steals, and
eventually decided the outcome of
the game.

Saturday night at Penn State’s
Rec Hall, Richards was shooting
78% on nine field. goal attempts,
totaling 16 points. His ball hawking
defense from the point guard
position led to several steals, and
eventually decided the outcome of
the _game.

During the telecast of the
Pitt-Virginia contest, the TVS
announcer , referred to Tom
Richards as “one of the enigmas of
basketball,-a guard who can shoot
over 50% from twenty feet, but can

make only 53% of his free throws.’.’ .

In the game against Virginia,
Richards missed crucial free throws
that could haye cost Pitt the game.

So at Penn State, with Pitt leading
by five, State had to foul someone
to get the ball back. Richards was
the likely candidate. “I was hoping
they'd come after me” Richards
said, a smile of success lighting up
his face. So Penn State fouled
Tommy, and he calmly made both
ends of a 1-1 situation. .

“My foul shooting was one of the
weakest parts of my , personal
game,” Richards said. “I worked
on foul shooting a lot last week, and
I guess it paid off.”

His shooting skills have rarely
been questioned. The junior guard
from Moon Township has averaged
better than 11 points a game this
season, an average that climbs with
every game. Yet he describes his

season thus far as only “pretty

good.”
.“Things are beginning to fall into
place right now,” he said.

“Everyone we have on the floor at
any particular time can work better
as a team. We’re all playing with
more confidence now, and that has
helped me play my game better,
especially on defense.” I'm playing
a more total game, both offensively
and defensively.”

Saturday’s game against Penn
State was described by Tom
Richards as “maybe my most
satisfying game this season.” This
is true for several reasons. “I shot
really well tonight,” he said after
the game. “It was one of my best
games since I’ve been here. It was

conﬁdence we need towin on the
road. The South Carolina game
showed us that we can play with
anyone, anywhere.”

Another reason for such satisfac-
tion came from his opponents. “I
always like beating Penn. State,
especially up here. It was tough to
lose to them in the Steel Bowl, and
I think the whole team gained some
measure of satisfaction.”

With the playoffs well within their
grasp, Tom Richards is looking

forward to the trip to Morgantown. _l

“We are reaching our season peak
now. I know we can win down
there.” . _

With this kind of confidence, how
can they lose?

BY ANDYBEHREND
Pitt’s gutsy grapplers saved the

.best for last Sunday afternoon
' against Penn State. '

Thanks to the “human block of
granite,” Carl Roba, the Panthers
upset PSU, 22-17. ,

Roba’s pin of Brad Benson at 1:30
of the ﬁnal period sent the scant
crowd at the Field House home
clamoring for more.

The day started inauspiciously for
Dave Adams’ squad, gaining two
draws at 118 and 126 pounds where

V a little help from referee Joe
Solomon failed to come through.

Solomon’s failure to call a stalling
penalty against PSU’s Ron Frantz
in the first match permitted him to
deadlock Kevin Nellis, 6-6. Nellis,
dominated the_ bout after Frantz,
subbing for injured veteran Wayne
Packer, squirmed for ﬁve quick
points. He then spent the rest of his
time crawling off the mat.

“That guy should’ve been called
for stalling, no doubt,” gritﬁid
Adams.

Adams’ ire overcame him a bit too
much in the next match between
George, Bryant and_’John Frick. A

chipped away at the lead, getting
even with a last minute escape for a
6-6 tie, mercifully, the last one of
the day.

With twobouts left, Pitt’s 16-14
lead was endangered with Jerry
White, an Eastern runner-up
meeting Bill Bailey at 190. White
bulldozedhis way to a 6-2 decision,
giving the N its their first lead of the
day, 17-16. p

representatives _to the men's
Easterns, which is scheduled for
March 7 at Trees Pool.-

Roba’s biggest foe. But his quick
takedown on Brad Benson, a PSU
tackle during football season, gave
the crowd hope that this would be
an “up” day for him;

Alas, Benson scored two escapes
and a takedown to forge ahead 4-2.
But Carl’s escape cut the lead to‘
one-going into the last period of the
exciting afternoon. '_ ‘

Roba came out and powered his
way to a reversal to take a 5-4 ‘lead,
and succeeded in -keeping Benson

twisted‘ like a pretzel. Suddenly,4,§;-)7

Roba had Benson stamped, inches
away from the pin. The thousand or

‘so fans screamed, ‘palpitatied,

shook...and went_ berserk, as Roba
did it at 1:30.. _

Pitt came up with its ﬁnest
wrestling hour, and- it could not
have come at a more opportune
time, as Adams gears hissquad for
the Easterns this weekend at
Annapolis. '
