University
Lacks Aid

From State

Pennsylvania’s three largest
university's, Pitt, Penn State,
and Temple, are all requesting
aid this month, but the state
legislature has so far failed to
approve their appropriations.

The University, according to
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, hav-
ing already asked for a time ex-
tension on 4.4 million dollars in
outstanding loans, is requesting
an additional ﬁve to six million
dollars for operating expenses.

Penn State, the largest of the
state-related university’s, plans
on ‘borrowing four million dol-
lars per month starting October
1, while Temple University, in

Philadelphia, also state-related,

has been borrowing 1.7 million
dolars monthly since the end of
the ﬁscal yea.r, June 30. Officials
expect this aid to increase to
two million dollars or more af-
ter September classes commence.

Meanwhile, the House of Rep
resentatives in Harrisburg has
accomplished nothing concern-
ing new taxes or appropriations
to meet this commitment. The
House is now in a two week re-
cess in order to permit mem-
bers to attend the National Leg-

islative Conference being held

in San Antonio, Texas.

The funds that are now being
requested by the University
from the state may have increas-

' ed interest rates. The University

hopes that the interest rate will
be ﬁve per cent. Yet, sources re-
port that the interest rates may
go up to ﬁve and one-half per
cent. _

There is some indication of
pressure. This may cause vote
on the proposed state appropria-
tions atan earlier date.

Begin Raising Funds for Engineering

The president of Gulf Oil Corporation and a group of
area business, industry, and community leaders will head
a three-year, $3.2-50,000 fund campaign for the University’s

SHOWN ABOVE is the architects model of the Benedum Hall of
Engineering. Part of the funds received from the new fund will
go for expenses of this facility.

School of Engineering.

The goal of the campaign, according to B. R. Dorsey, I

Gulf president and general chairman of the effort, will be
“to put engineering on the front burner among University SC‘hl0O‘1S
in a renewed drive toward excellence.”

The campaign was announced yesterday at a press conference
attended by Dorsey, Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar, and Harold E.
Hoelsche-r, dean of the School o-f Engineering.

The conculsion of the campaign is meant to coincide with com-
pletion of the new Michael L. Benedum Hall of Engineering, a. $12-
million structure that will be the second tallest on the campus.
When the 14-ﬂoor building is completed in 1969, engineering facil-
ities will be moved from seven different campus locations into this
one structure. Its erection will permit additional expansion in en-

gineering and in other areas.

Dorsey pointed out that the Benedum Hall building already has
been ﬁnanced through a combination of state and private funds,
but additional private funds are still needed, “The private donor
will mean the difference between an adequate program and a pro-

gram of excellence,” he stated.

Lives Off—Campus

Woman Student Decries Housing

by IVAN ABRAMS

The basement apartment
at 256 Oakland Ave. is unfit
for human habitation, ac-
cording to the Allegheny
County Health Department,
but Pamela Robinson, a sen-
ior at the University, cannot
ﬁnd another place to live. As
Long as she remains in the
condemned apartment, Miss Rob-
inson must continue to pay rent
to her landlord.

When she moved into the part-
ment, Miss Robinson was not
aware that it was illegal for a
landlord to rent dwelling space
in a basement. However, after
living in the apartment for three
weeks, she called the Health De-
partment and asked them to
make an inspection.

“‘I had no bathroom facilities A

other than a commode,” she
“and there were bare
electrical connections draped
from the uncovered beams in
the ceiling.”

When the Health inspectors
arrived, they found still more
violations of the County Hous-
ing Code. According to Miss
Robinson, “The health inspector
had a jolly good time bouncing
his head against the ceiling,
which is only six feet three
inches high.

“The inspector also noted that
the apartment had inadequate
ventilation, in fact, it has no
ventilation at all,” she contin-
ues. “Th only way I can get
air into the ‘dungeon’ is to open
up the back door, but my land-
lady forbade me to open up the
back door and put a garbage
can on top of it,” exclaims Miss
Robinson.

‘Fair’ Promotes
Pitt Activities

According to Marjie Kisilin-
sky and Bruce Barr, co-chair-
men of the Activities Fair, the
all-day recruiting event of Tues-
day “had more response than
any other year.”

Barr estimated that “several
thousand” students attended the
Fair. He a.so stated that of the
49 groups who had tables, 46
participated. Both Miss Kisilin-
sky and Barr agreed that the
members of the Fair showed
better preparation and followed
this year's carnival theme bet-
ter than last year.

Although the Fair was sched-
uled to close at 4 p.m. for din-
ner, Barr noted that the re-
sponse was so heavy, the booths
remained open continually. He
pointed out that “it was a time
when freshmen could learn more
about University activities, and

    

Strange as it seems, a gar-
bage can can be placed on the
back door; it’-s ﬂush with the
ground.

Miss Robinson had hoped that
the Health Department would
certify the dwelling for rent
withholding. She could then pay
her rent money into a special
account at Mellon Bank until the
landlord made the required re-
pairs to bring the apartment up
to code standards. But, since to
provide adequate ventilation the
landlord would have to exca-
vate the dirt from around the
building’s foundation, the Health
Department chose to condemn
the apartment.

The Health Department agrees
that no rent should be paid fo-r
the dwelling, but they inexplica-
bly refuse to certify it for rent
withholding. The irony of the
situation is that while in order
to qualify for rent Withholding
an apartment must have a to-tal
of 20 violation points. Miss Rob-
inson’s has 40. In other words,
the apartment is so bad that
Miss Robinson cannot withhold
her rent.

“Not only are there very“ few
reasonably priced apartments
available in Oakland at this -time
of year,” decries Miss Robinson,
“but as long as I live at 265
Oakland Ave. I have to pay
rent for a dwelling that the land-
lady can’t legally rent.

Miss Robinson continues,
“From my experiences I found
that one student alone can do
little about the poor condition of
student housing in the Oakland
area. However, if students form-
ed a true student union,” she
adds, “they could put organized
pressure on the landlords to
lower the rent and raise the
quality of the housing.”

 

Private funds to be raised in
the campaign will be used for
three purposes, Dorsey explain-
ed.

The largest portion ‘will be
used to furnish and equip Bene-
dum Hall. The building will

house 173 teaching and research _

laboratories and a 30,000-volume
library as well as classrooms
and office space. Plans also call

for closed circuit telcvisiony1acil- .

it-ies, special demonstration
equipment, engineering shops,
commuter laboratories, and
glassblowing facilities.

With the addition of the new
building, the School of Eng-ineer-
ing will be able to increase its
enrollment from it-s present num-
ber of 2,000 up to 2,500. Long-
range goals call for an enroll-
ment of 3,300.

A second use fo-r the private
funds raised in the campaign is
faculty development. These re-
sources will enalble faculty mem-
bers to attend short courses-,
seminars, and workshops; to
participate in internships; to
take part in iinternationasl meet-
ings; and to study abroad. Fu-
ture plans call for an increase
in faculty from the present level
of 116 up to 320.

Private support is also need-
ed to carry out the move from
its present various locations on
campus into Benedum Hall and
to ﬁnance the installation of
present equipment there.

“The need for qualiﬁed engi-
neers was never greater than
now,” Mr. Dorsey said, “but
something must be done now to
avoid a far more serious deﬁcit
in the years ahead. Industry
cannot meet this need on it-s
own, but neither can our schools
of engineering meet it without
help from industry.”

In the period since 1965, when
the present dean was appointed,
about two dozen new faculty
members have come to the
school from such other univer-
sities and industrial corpora-
tions as Illinois Institute of
Technology, Harvard, M. I. T.,
Standard Oil of New Jersey,
Cambridge, and Yale.

New Albums Enter Markets

by STEVE GITTLESON

Many new and interesting
album releases have graced
the record stands over the
.:1st few months. A few of
considerable worth will be
mentioned here.

Most people have heard that
the Beatles have again scored a
winner with their latest album
release, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely
Hearts Club Band (Capitol 2653 ) .
And it is quite ﬁtting that the
boys from Liverpool should add
a new dimension to-their “sound”
after their much publicized
breakup last fall.

In addition to the title song,
the album includes two ﬁne
solors by Paul McCartney, When
I’m Sixty-Four and She's Leav-
ing Home, one by Ringo Starr,
A Little Help from My Friends,
and two by John Lennon, Lucy

in the Sky with Diamonds and A,

Day in the Life.
Among the most unusual num-

bers on the album are George '

Harrison's Within You Without
You, which further demonstrates
his devotion to the sitar school
in modern music, A Day in the
Life, which has been banned in
England because it advocates
the use of drugs, and Lucy in
the Sky with Diamonds, which
for those who haven’t noticed, is
a symbolic title for LSD.

Most of the songs identify
with the hippie cult, but there is
enough solid material for even
the most discriminating non-
hippie to enjoy. Sgt. Pepper’s
Lonely Hearts Club Band clear-
ly demonstrates that the Beatles
formula of success is not only
changing wit.h the times, but
changing the times as well.

The Young Rascals have re-
leased their latest album, Groov-
in (Atlantic 8148). The record-
ing contains their three most
recent hits, Groovin, A Girl Like
You, and Ilow Can I Be Sure,
Also included in an excellent

solo by Eddie Brigati of A Place
in the Sun and a very interest-
ing new song, It’s Love.

Groovin shows the Young Ras-
cals at their best with many ex-
amples of superlative singing by
Brigati and Felix Cavaliere and
new and different instrumental
backgrounds. The jazz ﬂute ar-
rangement of It’s Love is es-
pecially refreshing example of
this.

Spanky and Our Gang releas-
ed their first album, Spanky and
Our Gang, a few weeks ago
(Mercury 61124). The album in-
cludes Sunday Will Never be
the Same and their current hit
Making Every Minute Count as
well as several other outstand-
ing selections. Byrd Avenue, us-
ing a Bosa Nova accompani-
ment, and Trouble, the Mere-
dith Willson tune from The Mu-
sic Man are two ﬁne examples
of the group's artistry. “Five
Deﬁnitions of Love, interesting-
ly enough, is merely the deﬁni-
tion of the word “love” in Web-
ster’s New Collegiate Dictionary.
The result, however, is very ef-
fective.

It has been said that Gracie
Slick makes the Jefferson Air-
plane ﬂy, and if this is true,
Spanky is undoubtedly the lead-
er of the Gang. Her electrify-
ing torch version of Brother

magnitude of only a Streisand
or 3. Garland. In their ﬁrst al-
bum, Spanky and Our Gang il-
lustrate their musical talents
beautifully. This ﬁrst album will
not be their last.

The Doors who have great
success with Light My Fire,
have also released their ﬁrst al-
bum recently, The Doors (Elec-
tra 74007). The selections are
decent, many in the folk idiom,
but each song tends to sound

very much like each other. There '

are, however, some very inter-
esting selections in the album,
including a very clever arrange-
ment of Alabama Song, Take It
as It Comes, and a song similar
to the Rolling Stones’ Going
Home, entiled The End.

The Doors style is, in fact,
very much like that of the R011-
ing Srtones, but their ﬁne instru-
mental background does deserve
some mention. If you plan to
buy the Doors’ album for back-
ground or party music, ﬁne. But

  Toward Better Leadership   ..

The annual Activities Fair held Tuesday in the Student Union Ball-
room unfortunately represents the only attempt to attract membership

by a good percentage of the participating organizations.

These groups will set up a booth once a year where they recieve
names of interested students, yet the names obtained by these clubs are
frequently not put to effective use. Even though they may now have from
100 to 200 new names on their membership rosters, most organizations
continue to be run by choice by an elite of several people, with-out really
trying to allow maximum participation on the part of their members.

These groups reﬂect the state of our student leadership, which is
but one more elite of students who frequently attain key positions be-
cause of their outstanding qualiﬁcations, but far too often they do so by
their overriding ambitions. Unfortunately the opportunists do succeed,
victorious in their drive because all too many capable students turn the
other cheek, allowing students to practically walk into important posi-

tions in all too many cases.

Because of‘ the abdication of responsibility by sualified but less
cunning students, we witness ineffective students achieving numerous
titles, titles acquired solely for the purpose of. reaping awards for that
individual student, such as membership in Omicron Delta Kappa, junior
and senior men’s leadership honorary. These students achieve their status

Draft Feasibility?

The Antiquated Giant

THE DRAFT, as it cur-
rently exists, does not serve
the national interest. Under
its present structures, the
draft wastes both money and
manpower.

The ﬁrst area of concern
is ‘the vast economic waste
imposed by the draft. Dr.
Walter Oi, professor of Eico-
nomics at the University,
predicted that if the draft
were replaced by a volunteer
system, the civilian economy
would save ﬁve billion dol-
lars.

Congressman Leonard
Wolfe stated that “we must
ask whether the $14,000 that
is spent on each conscript
(draftee) is not wasted when,
at the end of two years, just
when he may become- of some
possible use to the national

' defense, the conscript leaves

the armed forces.”
-CONGRESSMAN Wolfe
continued that we “now
spend 1.4 billion dollars per
100,000 inductees. This mon-
ey,” according to Wolfe
“could be used for training

those men who wanted to
make the military their ca-
reer.”

Directly related to the
problem of economic waste,
is the concern over the waste
of manpower which is caus-
ed by the present draft. Mil-
ton Friedman, professor of
economics at the University
of Chicago, believes that “we
now waste manpower by high
turnover, unnecessary train-
ing and retraining and the
use of underpaid servicemen
for menial tasks.”

B. H. LIDELL-HART, the
noted British military his-
torian supports this claim.
“The largest possible period
of conscript service,” says
Lidell-Har ,” is not long
enough to develop the stan-
dard of skill attainable with
long service volunteers, and
the time required increases
with the complexity of weap-
ons.”

The Cordiner Report on
Manpower sums up the prob-
lem. “The solution,” says the

report, “is not to draft more ..

men to stand and look at the
machinery. The solution is
to give the men already in
the armed forces the incen-
tive to stay long enough and
work hard enough to take on
higher responsibilities.

What, then, can be done
about the, ghastly draft that
wastes both money and man-
power? A number of peo-
ple have presented plans that
could ultimately solve our
problems.

CONGRESSMAN Thomas
C. Curtis is one among many
who advocates an all volun-
teer army. Curtis says that
“a volunteer army force
through increased pay and
other beneﬁts would have a
higher morale, would be bet-
ter trained and more able to
meet our immediate military
threats to our security.”

General Harold Maddox,
former chief of manpower
for the Defense Department,
has stated that “we need
dramatic changes in pay and
attitudes to upgrade military
career in the eyes of the na-
tion.” We can’t get this
change,” continued Maddox,
“with huge numbers of men
compelled to serve against
their will.”

Other draft critics think
that a system of universal
military training is the best
and most equitable system of
the draft. They contend that
any. means of selective serv-
ice is unfair and that all men
should serve their country
via the military. A universal
military service program, ac-
C01'dlI18" to its advocates,
would stop the trend of the
so-called “poor mans army.”

. The Neo-isolationists be-
l»leV€ that the US doesn't
need a military force. They
contend that the US should
completely reduce their for-
€18”n_ commitments and rely
on its nuclear deterrent
strength. This, says the neo-
isolationist, would only re.
quire a very limited techni-
cal force.

With all the constant and
emphatic debate on the cur-
rent structure of the draft,
one thing is certain. The
draft must be changed-—it
must be changed because it
simply is not feasible.

‘Cute’ Comments
Editor, The Pitt News:

Here are some questions di-
rected to the staff members of
the Pitt News who are respon-
sible for the “cute” comments
concerning commuters:

Have you and your car ever
played hide-and-seek with the
meter maids? Have you ever
stood on any of the metered
streets in Oakland (afraid to
leave your car) and begged pass-
ers-by for nickels, because you
only had dimes and quarters?

1:19.-vs: mi arse? Qssbsfl 29$ 2.?
a class because your last bus
leaves downtown in 30 minutes?
Have you ever paid a 30 cent
bus fare with a ﬁve dollar bill
and received $4.70 in coin for
change? (Yes, Virginia, there
are buses other than the 54C!)

Why is it that ignorant peo-

With‘News’Story

Editor, The Pitt News:

Your news article on General
Hershey in The Pitt News of
Monday, Sept. 18, contains sev-
eral incorrect items. First, the
Seeger decision (Supreme Court,
1965), operating on the old Se-
lective Service Act, broadened
the meaning of the “Supreme
Being” clause, which was con-
tained in that act, such that one
could obtain conscientious ob-
jection status if his moral or
philosophical beliefs occupied a
place in his life, equivalent to
that of a “Supreme Being."

Second, the new Selective Serv-
ice Act of 1967 eliminates the
“Supreme Being” clause, mak-
ing only those eligible for con-
scientious objection “who, by
reason of religilous training and
belief, are conscientiously oppos-
ed to war in any form” (section
6j).

This was the context in which
General Hershey was asked why

"Congress had contravened the

Supreme ‘ Court decision (al-
though it -has the right to do
so). The General was also asked

 

   

by often ingratiating themselves with administrators and by venturing
ruthlessly venturing onward. Yet their path is so easy, for opposition
to them is often nonexistent. Too few people care to even compete.

The statistics on the composition of our University, revealing the
increasing number of commuting students, bring forth another problem
to remedy, for these students must make a greater effort to participate
in the activities than those students living on campus. The odds may. be
against increasing the number of student activitists at our University,
but an attempt must be made if we are going to have the kind of student
leadership mandatory for effectively representing our students.

A few of us constantly decry that students should be included in
policy areas that directly affect them, but if the wrong students repre--
sent us, we’ll ﬁnd them accommodating administrators to build their own -
stock at the students’ expense.

We urge students to take the initiative and join our student or-
ganizations, just as we urge the officers of these organizations to utilize
their newly acquired members. To built the solid student leadership man-
datory for effective student representation, there must be a concerted
effort to train potential leaders. Otherwise, nothing of real signiﬁcance
can be accomplished by our students.

lllllllllllllllllll

if he did not think that, in light

of the new and sole ground for 

conscientious objection, that is,
religious training and belief,
Congress was violating the spir-
it of the First Amendment to
the Constitution, prohibiting the
establishment of any religion.
The crucial point here is not
that any particular religion is
established, but that religion is
made the criterion for judging
between individuals for the exe-
cution of political policy, with-
out taking into account those
people who cannot claim speciﬁ-
cally religious training and be-
lief, but who are equally «op-
posed to war.

On ‘Y’ Letter

Editor, The Pitt News:

I read with interest Mr. Way’s
letter in the Pitt News of Sept.
13, 1967. I was fortunate to be
among 15 students and staff
who composed the University of
Pittsburgh Branch YMCA’s In-
ternational Workcamp in Quito,

Ecuador, from April to June, «*

1966. Indeed, the time spent in
our work in Quito was a most
interesting international exp-eri-
ence. We formed close friend-
ships with the Pitt faculty at
the Universidad Central, and
with their assistance joined Cen-
tral students in informal gab
sessions on student life styles
in our respective countries and
more formal seminars with fac-
ulty from our schools on poli-
tics and international problems.
I heartily agree with Mr. Way
that more student-to—student con-
frontation is needed. The only
way to fully appreciate the "dif-
ferences ln culture that divide
us from our Ecuadorian counter-
parts, but most important the
human values which unite us, is
through direct communications.
Mi‘. Way’s proposal for an ex-
change of articles from our cam-
pus publications is a signiﬁcant
step in this direction. Perhaps
such an exchange would encour-
age more students to consider
personal participation in stu-
dent-to-student relationships with
interational students at Pitt and
ultimately they might go as in.

Faculties Demand Say In Academic Governance

Collegiate Press Service

WASHINGTON — An ef-
fective system of governing
institutions of higher educa-
tion should be built on the
concept of “shared author-
ity” between the faculty and
the administration, accord-
ing to a task force of the
American Association for
Higher Education.

The task force, in a report
entitled “Faculty Participation
-i~i Academic Governance,” said
American colleges and universi-
ties should combat increased
faculty ferment by giving fac-
ulty members significant author-
ity in the decision-making pro-
ccss. The report was made pub-
lic Sunday (Sept. 17).

In intensive studies of 28 pub-
lic and six private institutions
of higher education, the task
force found that “faculty un-
rest and demands for more ef-
fective representation in the af-
fairs of the college and univer-
sity -have reached signiﬁcant di-
mensions.

Admitting that many institu-
tions have taken steps to in-
crease faculty responsibility re-
ponsibility, the task force never-
theless says, “We discovered
enough problems to occupy gen-
erations of chancellors yet un-
born.”

The 67-page task force report
says the main sources of dis-
content are the faculty’s desire
to participate in the determina-
tion of those policies that eﬁect
its professional status and per-
formance and in the establish-
ment of complex, statewide sys-
tems of higher education that
-have decreased local control over
important campus issues.
”"AI‘-lie_ faculty voice should be
the major voice in the formula-
tion of such policies as admis-
sions standards, the contents of
the curricula, degree require-

ments, grading standards, stan-
dards for academic freedom,
standards for student conduct
and discipline, and procedures
for the appointment of depart-
ment chairmen, deans, and the
president, the report says.

In addition, the task force
says the faculty should have
“shared authority" in admillib‘
trative policies. PerS0m1e1 ad‘
ministration, economic matters,
and public questions involving
the role and functions of the
institution.

Of the 34 institutions studied
-by the task force, only 25 per
cent had a system of shared au-
thority where both the faculty
and the administration enjoyed

effective inﬂuence over major

decisions. However, the study
was not designed to provide a
cross-section of American higher
educations. The task force stu-
died institutions where there
were signs of impending major
changes in the relationship of
the faculty and the administra-
tion.

The main centers of faculty
discontent are in the public jun-
ior colleges and the new or
“emerging" four-year colleges
and universities, the report said.
The older state colleges, the mul-
versities, were more likely to be
characteri7cd by shared author-
ity or faculty primacy.

“Junior college faculty mem-
bers are no longer satisﬁed with
the passive role of teacher in a
highly centralized structure
where control over educational
policies and the conditions of
employment is lodged in the
hands of the board and the head
of the institution,” the task force
says.

In a new or emerging four-
year institutions, top adminis-
trators often have a background
in secondary education with an

authoritarian tradition of man-

agement inappropriate to col-
leges and universities, the report
adds.

Economic factors, such as sal-
ary level and structure, may con-
tribute to faculty discontent, but
appear to be of secondary im-
portance, the report says.

The task force, a seven-mem-
her group composed of profes-
sors from different disciplines
and diverse institutions, voiced
a strong preference for the aca-
demic senate as a “model” for
campus governance. In doing so,
the task force favored the “in-
ternal” governing pattern over
such “external” agencies as cam-
pus chapteis of national profes-
sional associations, like the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors, or local affili-
ates of trade unions or bargain-

ing agencies.

But the report emphasizes that
the mere establishment of an or-
ganization identiﬁed as an aca-
demic senate will not be suffi-
cient to attain effective repre-
sentation and authority in mak-
ing decisions.

Concerning strikes, the task
force concluded “there are no de-
cisive reasons why the faculty
should be denied the opportunity
to strike, in terms of either so-
ciety’s essential needs for the

long-run interests of the institu-
tion.” But the report says strikes
can be justified only when shar-
ing of information by faculty
and administration, appeals to
reason, and the use of arbitra-
tors or other neutral third par-
ties have all clearly failed to
prevent or resolve a. faculty-ad
ministrative impasse.

The report is the ﬁrst in a
series to be issued over the next

two years by the American As-R

sociation for Higher Education‘.

Can Pride Overcome Power?

“The Day the Defense Stood Still" isn’t the name of a
new science ﬁction release to the Panther defense unit, how-
ever, that day existed one year ago, and it remains a night-
mare.

Greg Keller remembers last year’s opener at UCLA.
He recalls the plane ﬂight, the sightseeing, and California’s
other distractions. He remembers the feeling of playing in
unfamiliar surroundings. And his mind replays the way
the defense froze that night in the warm Coliseum.

“We just didn’t hit,” Keller recollects. The Bruin of-
fense broke enough tackles and took advantage of enough
missed assignments to romp, 57-14.

Tomorrow the Panthers face a UCLA team that coach
Dave Hart considers better than last year’s. And Keller
thought that last year’s UCLA offense was the toughest
in the nation.

BUT SOMEWHERE in Ke1ler’s words, and in the state-
ments of the coaches, for that matter there is an underly-
ing feeling of conﬁdence. Conﬁdence fostered by the pride
that the defense has generated into execution.

The freshman team can attest to the pride instilled in
the defensive unit. In practice, freshman ballplayers don’t
hit after the whistle and expect to avoid a pointed alterca-
tion. The grunts, the pursuit, and the gang tackling of the
varsity can be heard and seen from all over Trees Field.

THE DEFENSE wants to make sure that last year’s
debacle is not repeated tomorrow. Playing his ﬁrst game
at middle linebacker, Keller feels that if his unit is on the
ﬁeld “for 50, 60, or even 70 plays, we’ll be all right.” He
realizes that the offensive team has to engineer the drives
to give the defense a breather.

With Frank Gustine at quarterback this week, the of-
fense has looked crisp and sharp for the ﬁrst time this fall.
The blocking of the offensive line has never looked better
and there lies the key for tomorrow.

If the running game can get established, and if Gus-
tine has time to throw, the offense can move the football.
And if the offense moves the ball, the defense will get its
chance to vindicate itself for last year.

Of course, the Bruins have the veteran defense to go
with the productive offense. Hart anticipates double cover-
age on Bob Longo, one of the Panthers’ proven threats.
The UCLA secondary, returning intact, remembers Longo’s
performance in the Coliseum. The Panther split end caught
11 passes in the one bright spot of last year’s opener.

BUT UCLA ﬁgures to be “down” after their convinc-
ing, but narrow win over Tennessee last week. lt’s their
turn to make the long, tiring plane ﬂight. And they’ll be
the team playing in unfamiliar surroundings this time.

How much of a role the emotional factor will play to-
morrow can’t be judged now. The oddsmakers have disre-
garded it. They're spotting the Panthers three touchdowns.

But the home crowd, the familiar turf, and the thor-
ough knowledge of UCLA has got to make a difference. The
Panther sophomores will ﬁnd the going easier at home than

— they would away. Hart said this week that the 53,000 at

the Steelers’ ﬁrst game had to give the pros an extra im-
petus. He hopes a large crowd will be there to spur the
Panthers on.

It had better be if the intangibles of spirit, desire, and
pride are to compensate for UCL.A’s machine.

UCLA FOCUS:

All-American Beban P rovides Spark

To Ignite Deadly Bruin Powderkeg

by MIKE BROURMAN

The smog hangs heavy
over Los Angeles, and the
average .Citizen gasps for breath
beneath it. One man, however, is
not bothered by the air. He is
only six feet tall, but his head
is in the clouds. His name is
Gary Beban.

UCLA coach Tommy Prothro
calls Beban “probably the ﬁnest
football player in the country.”
and he adds that without Beban
in there, the Bruins would be in
trouble. One look at the statis-
tics compiled by Beban in his
two years of college football
and it is hard to doubt the ﬁrst
statement. One look at the teair
Beban has playing with him, and
it is hard to accept the second

In the two years preceeding
Beban’s arrival, UCLA won six
games and lost 14. In Beban’s
iirst two season’s of varsity ba.l!.
the Bruins have won 17 and lost
only three.

As a quarterback, he is strict
13 a rollout passer. He throws
well, as his 50 per cent com-
pletion average and 15 touch-
down passes will attest to. But,
it is as a runner that Beban ex-
cels. When he rolls out, he has
the unique ability to wait till
the last second to commit him-
self.

It is this ability which sep-
arates Gary Beban from the
crowd. While the defense hesi-
tates, he ﬂys. He makes the big
play when UCLA needs it most.
When fortunes look the lowest
is when Beban is most danger-
ouls.

As a result, he holds almost
every UCLA offensive record.
Those few which he does not
hold, he is closing in on this
year.

But, he is not doing it alone.
He is operating behind a team,
despite Prothro-’s denials, is ﬁrst
class even without his presence
in the lineup.

When Behan throws, he will
be aiming for the fastest re-
ceiver in college football, Hal
Busby, who runs the 100 in 9.3.
Split end Dave Nulttall, the other
wide receiver, is not fast but he
has the ability to get open. Tight
end Rich Spindler is a two year
starter.

When Beban runs, he will op-
erate behind a line that is big,
but mobile. The right side of the
line is experienced, but the left
side is relatively untried. Sig-
niﬁcantly, Beban’s big gains

§ .

With almost all of his senior year remaining, Gary Beban appears

well on the way to becoming the top player in UCLA history. Beban
already holds the marks for career total offense, season total offense,
most TD’s in a season, and most yards passing in a season. He is clos-
ing in on two other records, career yards passing, and career scoring.
All of this, plus UCLA’s ﬁne team, makes him the leading candidate

for the Heisman Trophy.

against Tennessee, including his
27 yard dash for the winning
score, came on sweeps to the
right.

Beban’s backﬁeld running
mates are big -and strong. Full-
back Rich Purdy is a tough in-
side runner who has never been
thrown for a loss in his varsity
career. Soph halfback Greg
Jones broke in with a loud banng
last week as UCLA defeated
Tennessee, 2016. In 16 carries,
Jones gained 135 yards and was
named the game's MVP.

When UCLA does not have
the ball, they rely on an experi-
enced, tough defense. The six
man line is small but extremely
quick and plays havoc with wide
plays. End Vic Lepisto and
guard Larry Agajanian are the
standouts.

Linebackers Don Manning and
Mike Ballou are big, yet still

Mouen Out; Booters

Visit West Chester

by JERRY GRUEBEL

“West Chester is going to be toug 1,” said soccer coach

Leo Bemis of tomorrow’s opponent. “They play a very agres-
sive game and they’re well experienced.‘

“A tough” team, such as West
Chester, isn't Bemis’ only prob-
lem. Boo-ter injuries make the
outlook dismal. “We’re hurting,”
explained Bemis, “Ernie Mouen
sprained his ankle very badly.
He can’t even put on a tennis
sneaker.” He won’-t be able to
play this week.”

Sophomore halfback Ron Miel-
ecki also sprained his ankle.
‘He'll be -able to play,” explain-
ed Bemis, “if we don’t let him
practice for the next few days.
He’ll replace Mouen if he’s
ready.”

Bemis did have three bright
spots to talk about. Shelton Zvo-
ma, who originally decided to
devote full time to his studies
is back on the team. “Right
now,” said Bemis, “I’d have to
say that Shelly will start at
right wing.” Zvoma, a senior let-
tered last year.

Bemis can alto be tha.nkful
that interior forward Bob Trex-
ler does not have a broken toe
as had been feared. “It still
-hurts him, but he’1 be arig'ht,”
said Bemis. “He’s a tough kid
who wants to pay.

Ion Bagey, who spent his last
two years at the Bradford re-
gional campus, has also started
practicing again. The cast has
been taken off his foot. “Bagley
is about 75 per cent now. He
l1asn’t shown ﬁrst team capabil-

MU-3 you ucvauat: uca urn, U
ities yet because he’s out of
shape,” explained Bemis, “But
I'm hoping he’ll come through.”
Bagley also plays right wing.

Bemis will need every boo-ter he
has when the teams meet in West
Chester. “We’ll have enough
players, but you hate to not use
your top men,” moaned Bemis,
“we're a little down.” A win
could be the cure.

Distancemen

Score Easily
Over Rockets

The varsity and freshmen
cross country teams simply
ran away from Slippery Rock
in scoring one—sided victories
Tuesday afternoon.

“To, tell you the truth,” said
a happy coach Jim Banner,
“Slippery Rock did not offer too
much competition. Our boys
pretty much ran together dur-
ing the meet.”

The. varsity’s 16-34 victory
could be attributed to the har-
riers being a better conditioned
team, according to Ban-ner. The
spanking new 4.8 mile course
took away the Rockets’ home
course advantage.

Paul Zink, Paul Greig, and
Ken Lawton head the scoring.
The three ﬁnished in a dead heat
for first place. Their winning
time was 28 minutes 10 seconds.
Roger Holly placed fourth and
Jay Jensen, who was not sup-
posed to run until late in the
season, ﬁnished a strong sixth.

The freshmen, in their ﬁrst
outing in inter-collegiate com-
petition, scored a perfect 15-50
victory over the Rocket's fresh-
man squad. Banner also attri-
buted this decisive Victory to the
team’s ﬁne conditioning.

its‘; 153': Blast ﬁmsasr was
Jeff Wilson, i-n a time of 28 min-
utes and 15 seconds, only ﬁve
seconds slower than the varsity
winning time. Following Wilson
were John Crozier (2), Mark
Vornhagen (3), Greg Rodgers
(4), and Jerry Richey (5).

Both teams travel tomorrow.
They face Ohio University and
Kent State in a triangular meet
at Kent.

‘Beulah’ De poses ‘Bang’

Now that the amateur prognosticators- have concluded their
football forecasts, it is time for the pros to take over. Thus, the
Intrepid Yogis, with no regard for the safety of life or limb, be-
gin their 1967 season with a full slate of impossible-to-pick games.

“The contest will be. wide-open this year,” garbles Sports Edi-
tor Jay “Flatbu:s"n” Rosenstein. “Now that we’ve ﬁnally gotten rid
of Blood ‘n’ Guts everybody has a chance.”

Blood ‘n’ Guts, or, as he is known to his intimate circle of
acquaintances. Bang is deposed Editor Fred Frank. Ban.g’s acquain-
tances include a number of grimy, seedy underworld bookies,
which explains his runaway victory last year.

Speaking Of grime, we come to George “Moustachio” Lies.
The Grubby One is in his fourth year of guessing and has won
twice. But, he seems to be slipping. The last sure thing the “Mous-
tache” bet on was the Egyptian army.

Meanwhile “Flatbulsh,” a two time loser, is back for his ﬁnal
try dripping with conﬁdence. “Now that I’ve retired from chasing
birds, I’ll be able to devote full-time to yo-gi,” he announced. “Flat-
bush” was also dripping beer at the time, which makes his pre-
diction shaky.

The new member of the unholy trinity is Mike “Hawk” Brour-
man. “l am ready,” says the Hawk. “Wins will begat wins and my
cup will runneth over.” As he was with “Flatbush” at the time,
it is not hard to tell what his cup was running over with.

Linda “Beulah” Goldstein has the awesome task of replacing
“Bang” as “Beulah” will no doubt be handicapped by the fact
that she knows more about football than “Blood ‘n’ Guts,” she
can be div"s‘r‘ni~ssed as a contender. In the same category (useless)
fall the coaches, the players and the girls (at least for “FlatJbush”).

Now take the newest

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor
A 3 touchdown underdog, the Panthers
unveil its 78th football squad tomorrow

against UCLA. And up until the 1:30 p.m.
kickoff at the Stadium, Dave Hart knows the
defense must not ﬂinch one bit against Gary
Beban.

Except for two sophomores, the Jungle Cats’
defensive array is pretty much the same outﬁt
which held Notre Dame to seven points in 30
minutes of play last year.

Anchored by middle guard G-reg Keller, a
possible All-American candidate, the defense
works from a 4-3-4 formation with Keller posi-
tioned as a linebacker, or a 5-2-4 with Keller on
the line.

Letterman Terry Hoover starts at left end
while sophomore Paul Naponick has earned the
spot at right end.

The tackles are big ones in Ed Whittaker and
Dave Drake. And with Lou Parrott and Ed Gal-
lin behind the line, Hart has groomed a veteran
team.

Assistant defensive coach Bill Lewis insists
the Beban oriented offense can be stopped.

Lewis has taken three seniors and a sopho-
more and developed them into a four man sec-
ondary which he feels, “Is very capable of con-
taining UCLA’s passing game.”

The seniors are Joe Curtin, the prowler in
the secondary, Paul Killian, and Mickey Depp.

Dave Dibbley is the lone soph.

Against Tennessee, UCLA always shifted
away from the Vols’ defensive strength. Tennes-
see played a 5-3-3 most of the time. But Lewis
feels an opponent could never shift away from
the Panthers’ four man team.

“With two cornerman and two safties, we
have more maneuverability. We never look our-
selves in one defensive formation,” explained
Lewis.

“Aganist the Bruins, we have to rely on prop-
er positioning,” said Lewis, thinking of coach
Tommy Prothro’s Harold Busby, a 9.4 man.

The Ulcans are a quick team. They move the
ball ﬁve, six yards each play. They deploy a short
passing game.

“But Busby is used on the route,” inserted
Lewis. Busby is considered by pro scouts as po-
tentially the ﬁnest deep receiver in the country.

Offensively, Hart plans to throw the football
with Frank Gustine at quarterback. And in prac-
tice this week, the Panthers have worked on live
pass protection. The freshmen simulated UCLA’s
stunting and blitzing tactics.

“Some of our young offensive lineman have
shown they can pick up blitz-ing linebackers.
Sophomore Warren Allen is one of the best,” said
Hart.

In the game, Hart plans to call the offensive
signals. “I certainly have to help our quarter-

backs. Both of them are too young. And it’s too ,

much responsibility for either Jeff Barr or Gus-
tine,” Hart said. ‘
