VOLUME EIGHTY-ONE, ISSUE FIFTY I

Pitt provost heading for University of Illinois

By Dirk Kaufman

Managing Editor

Assistant Provost Jack Daniel has accept-
ed an administrative position at the

University of Illinois at Chicago and will.

leave before" the end of the term.
Daniel, 44, will be assuming the posi-

tion of associate chancellor and assosci— '

ate vice president of academic affairs at

A the Chicago campus.

Daniel said_yesterday he regrets not hav-
ing the opportunity to continue his work
in affirmative action here. Work which
must continue when he leaves, he said.

”There are a number of issues related
to black studentshfaculty and staff "to
which I have worked very hard, to bring
about change,” Daniel said yesterday. ’’I
don't believe any change that has oc-‘
curred resulted from something I personal-
ly did. My biggest concern is that things
don't go backward.

”We are losing black faculty at the

university, and things are not improzirzg
for black students,” he said.

Daniel served as chairman of the depart-
ment of black studies and as associate
dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
before joining the provost’s office two
years ago. \ » ’

Executive Vice President Jack Freeman
said he regrets Daniel's departure.

7‘’I think the university's going to miss

Jack,” Freeman said. ”The fact that he was

able to secure this position is testimony
to his exceptional work at Pitt.

”We’d love to convince him to stick
around, but there were more pull factors‘
at Chicago than push factors at Pitt.”

Daniel's wife Jerlean, 42, who is head
of the Pitt Child Care Center, will also be
taking a position with the faculty at the
university. -

’’I think it's important to remember

we're also losing the director of our child"
. care center,” Freeman said. ”[Mrs. Daniel]

has been a very competent director.”

’’If you ask anyone about Dr. Jerry
Daniel,” Daniel said, ”you’ll find them
saying she runs one of the highest quality
child care centers in both the city and
state. A

”lt’s disappointing for both of us to find
we're leaving something we care so much
about.” -

Daniel said he has been most proud 0

field of study you can name,” he said.
”|’ve had many exciting opportunities
here,” Daniel said. ”Working in the

Faculty of Arts and Sciences and in thé.

provost’s [office during the planning
process —— those were very excit_ing times.

”The frustration comes when consider-
ing the‘ issues of progress for blacks over
the last six or seven years.” _ V

In his current position, Daniel served as
head of the office of academic affairs for_

the undergraduate shool and the regional .

campuses.

Daniel said his new position would be
equivalent to a primary assistant of-the
president here.

”The University of Pittsburgh is a great
institution with a lot to offer,” Daniel said.
”But in the final analysis, the university
in Chicago had more to offer my wife and
I than did Pitt.” ’

’’It’s the kind of opportunity for ad-
vancement that he can't turn down.”

Mutineers refuse to abandon television station

MANILA, Philippines — Rebel
soldiers brandishing M—16 rifles
would not leave a broadcasting
complex Thursday even though
their leader agreed to end the
two-day occupation. ‘

Military spokesman Col.
Honesto lsleta said about 150
mutineers still were occupying
the complex housing Channel 7
television and DZBB radio. Earli-
er, it was estimated 190 rebel
soldiers and 55 civilians were in
the building, and there were no
signs anyone had left.

At mid—day, police fired tear-
gas at scores of supporters of de-
posed President Ferdinand E.
Marcos who gathered about 200
yards from the walled complex.

More than five hours earlier,
Defense Minister Rafael Ileto and
Col. OscargCanlas, leader of the
rebel troops in the complex, said
the mutineers would leave.

Committee rejects
Gorbachev’s reforms

MOSCOW — The Communist _

Party expelled two old guard stal-

warts from its highest ranks Wed-
nesday and gave Kremlin leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev greater
control of the powerful secretari-
at, but it did not make some re-
forms he proposed.

The two-day plenum of more
than 300 Central Committee
members did not fulfill the
rumors of dramatic leadership
changes, and its results suggest-
ed disagreement over some pro-
grams Gorbachev included in his
lengthy speech Tuesday.

It endorsed Gorbachev’s insis-
tence on accelerated economic
change and more openness in
Soviet society, however. A final
resolution said: ”There is no-
where we can retreat.”

Removal of the former Kazakh-
stan party leader, 74-year-old

Dinmukhamed A. Kunaev, from.

the ruling Politburo eliminated
one of the last Brezhnev-era lead-
ers from the national leadership.

Also retired was 72-year-old
Mikhail S. Zimyanin from the
party secretariat ”for health
reasons.”

Ousted president to

face second trial

BOSTON — A jury Wednesday
found the ousted president of
Westfield State College innocent
of sexually. assaulting a student.

The Suffolk Superior Court jury
deliberated eight hours before ac-
quitting Francis J. Pilecki of two

charges of indecent assault and

battery.

Pilecki faces a second trial on
two charges stemming from an al-
leged sexual assault of a second
student. Each charge carries a
maximum penalty of five years in
prison.

The case, which was moved
across the state following intense
publicity, prompted statewide in-
vestigations into the use_ of col-
lege funds after it was disclosed
that a student was secretly given

 

a $10,000 payment from college
funds in connection with the sex-
ual assault charges.

Mayflower Madam says she's proud of her success

By Liz Habib
Staff Writer.

Some people brag about being
a success. So does Sidney Biddle
Barrows, but not because she's a
doctor or lawyer. She brags about
being a madam. .

”It was the best job I ever had,”
said Barrows to approximately
500 students last night "in the Wil-
liam Pitt Assembly Room.

Barrows called the business
that she ran for five and a half
years ”fun,
challenging, and profitable.”

Some girls cost up to $250 per
hour with a minimum of two
hours, she said.

Month.

Dennis Brutus, chairman of the
black studies‘ department,
presented the initial lecture, ”The
Politics and Economic Studies of
Race: South Africa and Apart-
heid,” Tuesday ‘night in Forbes
Quad. _

Brutus discussed the historical
origins of apartheid and the ef-
fects it has had on blacks living
in South Africa.

didn't have a clue what the busi-
nesswas about.”

After losing her job as a gener-
al merchandising manager, she
was talking to. a friend who
worked answering telephones for
a call girl agency.
In need of money, Barrows got
involved answering phones for
the service.

She and a colleague, whom
she called ”Lucy,” didn't like the
way the girls were being treated,
so they decided to start their own
call girl agency.

’’It was really easy to set up,”
said Barrows. ”We started with
two phone lines at each of our
homes and used call-
forwarding.”

Barrows claimed to have treat-

ed the girls much better than any
other agency. The girls were paid
for every job, even if they didn't
finish it.

”I always gave at least $20 for
time and trouble,” said Barrows.

The service was operated from
4:00 pm. till 1:00 a.m. every
day, and accepted cash, checks,
Visa and Mastercard, according
to Barrows.

According to Barrows, the men
who called were looking for a
fantasy.’

”They wanted to pay for some-
thing that they couldn’t get in
their real Iife,” she said.

The Mayflower Madam’s in-
come was approximately

new approach to divestment

”The issue of divestment is one
of the few that we can directly af-
fect,” said Brutus.

According to ‘Brutus, apartheid
first began in the 18505 when di-
amonds and gold were disco-
vered in South Africa. ”The
Africans saw no need to engage

in the,mining_process,” said.

Brutus.

He pointed out that the coloni-
al administration set up a frame-
work of laws that forced the
Africans to work in the mines.
The government also passed in-
flux control laws which limited
the freedom of movement of the
Africans. Special Iand,. called
Bantus, was set aside for the
miners. These laws resembled the
segregation policies held in many
southern states until the civil

rights movement of the 19605.

According to Brutus, ”The
black population was growing
steadily, and there was a fear that
it [the population increase] would
swamp the whites.” In 1948, the
legal structure governing apart-
heid was passed.

”The idea is that before the

white man settled, South Africa_

was settled by a number of black
tribes. Each of the old tribal struc-
tures, which had been broken
down, could be revived.
.”They've [the South African
government} succededgin trans-
porting people intothese areas
called Bantustans," said Brutus.
The Bantus tended to be arid.
This change forced the peopleito
go into the city for work.

that she always paid her taxes, as

she didn't want to get caught on '

any technicalities. »
But,"’AIl good things must

come to an end,” as Barrows

said. ‘

She was turned in by her land-‘
lord, arrested, and immediately-

became a media figure because
of her relation to the original
settlers. .

Barrows has published a book
entitled The Secret Life of the
Mayflower Madam and now
tours the lecture circuit. '

ever happened to me,” Barrows

A better athletic

buildingneeded

"The time has come for this university to seriously consider
building a new sports facility for basketball and other sports.
The men's basketball program recently sold out the Civic Are-
na, and it will most likely do the same when it hosts Syracuse
Feb. 9. Still, the Civic Arena is not the answer. Moving all the
games downtown would detract from the atmosphere created

by the students and the campus. The games should be kept in_ V

the Oakland area.

Recently, therehas been talk of constructing this facility but,
as far as we know, that is all there has been.— talk. Specula-
tion will get us nowhere. Talk is cheap. The time for action
is now. ' g _ A _

The arena should be constructed in a different area, perhaps
in the area between Hillman ‘Library and Carnegie Library. Park-
ing problems could be solved by including a garage beneath

the structure.

The Cathedral of Learning, the William Pitt Union and Forbes
Quad would surround the structure. That is better than the area
thatcurrently surrounds Fitzgerald Field House.

What must be stressed, however, is that this structure should
not be simply a basketball structure. It could be used by other

‘i varsity sports, and its location would definitely increase the stu-
. dent interest in sports such a wrestling, volleyball, girl's basket-
. ball and tennis. To attend a minor sports event, students would

no longer have to climb the hill. Instead, they would only have

to cross Forbes Avenue.

It is the policy of The Pitt News to accept all letters ‘submitted and
to publish only those which contain the writer's signature and stand- ‘
ing. No letters without the afore mentioned criteria will be submitted

by The Pitt News for publication.

The Pitt News editorial "Roe
vs. Wade should still stand"

‘(Monday, Jan. 26) contained seri-

ous errors. _

The first error the writer made
was in assuming that what con-
trol a woman has over her own
body entitles her to destroy the
body of another human being liv-
ing within her womb. To some
extent, every woman has the right

, to control her body, but that right

is only partial and not absolute.
For example, it is illegal for a
woman to kill herself with drugs.

Science and medicine give
proof that life begins at concep-
tion and that in any pregnancy
there are twolor more bodies.
Some place little value on the
pre-born baby — but this does
not mean that it doesn't exist as
a body. Abortion is the destruc-
tion of a separate human body.

Pro-lifers speak for the rights of .

the little, pre-born body because
the helpless cannot speak for
themselves.

The [editors were] also in error
when [they] wrote that women
have the right to abort a baby
only within the first six months.
On Jan. 22, 1973, the U.S.
Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade
and Doe vs. Bolton struck down
all laws against abortion and
legalized in all 50 states for the
full nine months of pregnancy for
social and economic reasons. [...]

Hence, we have had abortion
on demand for the past 14 years
in our nation, and over 20 million
babies have been killed. Looking
clearly at the reality of the situa-

tion shows that those of the pro--

life faction are the ones who real-
ly care about both the mother
and the'baby. All these years,
they have worked to help wom-
en.with problem pregnancies,

After his opening lines,_.the

First and foremost, he adressed
the |ran—Contra situation. Fair

‘ enough, that's where he needed

to do the most explaining. He
took/’ful| responsibility” for the
whole affair; he regretted taking
a risk that didn't work; he admit-
ted that there were mistakes
made; and he pledged to take the
necessary actions to correct those

' mistakes. At first glance, it sounds

as if he said a lot.

But think about it.

He took "full responsibility”
for the whole affair, but what

does that mean? Perhaps it tells ,

us that he authorized the ‘plan.
Where does that leave the origi-
nal claims that he had no,
knowledge of the affair? In the
dark, I guess.

He said he doesn't like taking
risks that don't work. Is getting

caught one of those risks? Was
the potential illegality of the en-
tire affair one? Maybe, maybe
not.,The guy wasn't real clear.

He admitted that there were
mistakes made. There sure were.
But what does the president think ’
those mistakes were? Was the
whole mess a mistake? Was it
wrong? Tell us, Mr. President,
we're listening.

Finally, he promised to take the
necessary actions. What are
they?! To continue on the path
he's on now? Is he going to keep
fighting terrorists by giving other
terrorists arms? Please Ron, stop
making so much sense!

And with a pledge to take the
necessary actions, he convenient-
ly moved to the next topic by tell-
ing Congress to stop worrying
about such insignificant things
and get back to work.

Skirting the issues didn't stop
there. He pledged to redouble ef-

forts in the war on drugs. But how '

can we redouble efforts when, re-
cently, he very quietly proposed

I am surprised that the editori-
al board permitted the article
”Let’s not close our eyes” to be
published in the Wednesday edi-
tion of The Pitt News. This arti-
cle was not surprising not
because of the opinion it ex-
pressed, but because of the shod-
dy journalism involved.

The editorial board has the’.

privilege of expressing its majori-

ty opinion, however absurd it

may be, but it also should exer-
cise some responsibility when

selectingthose articles which ex-

press it's opinions.

He agreed that the deficit is too
high. Well, deficits don't get to be
deficits on their own. Reagan's
fiscal suicide made them what
they are.

School reform! He's all for that
too. He wants to kick drugs out
of school, reinstate God and get
back to basics. But all of that costs
more money than, he is making
available to education.

He sent some strong words to
the Russians as well, blaming
them for his lack Iof any arms‘
agreements over the last six years.

He again called for a constitu-
tional amendment that would
mandatea balanced budget. The
man who has run up the largest
federal tab in the history of this
country wants the Constitution to

outlaw his spending policies.

And for the finale, and oh what
a finale, he invoked the name of

And if he is guilty of something,

_ it is not for the media to decide

but for the Congress. Nowhere in.
the Constitution does it state that
the media possesses judicial
responsibilities.

It is not the, media's place to act
as a judge, and a responsible
journalist would never use the
media as the [vehicle] to conduct
a witch hunt. If the Congress finds
President Reagan in violation of
the law, he will surely be treated
accordingly. Until then, let us as-
sume that he is innocent." [...]

SYRACUSE — Who would

I have thought? Me and Diamond

Dave touring together? No way.
But, yes, it happened.

Last week, as I parked the car
that had carried John Enright,
Marhsall Clark and myself out-
side the Ramada Inn in Clifton,
N.J., I noticed several customized
buses in the same parking |ot..

We had just returned from
covering the Pitt-Seton Hall
basketball game. '

”Must be Willie Nelson or Ge-
orge Jones -— one of those
country-western singers,” I
thought to myself.

It was two nights later in Peter's
Pub that I found out who those
buses belonged to. Bill Hillgrove
(the student basketball manager,
not the television personality) in-
formed me they belonged to
David Lee Roth.

I was stunned.

Exactly 12 days later, I_found
myself driving down Harrison
Avenue in Syracuse, N.Y. I was
in town to cover the Pitt-Syracuse
basketball game.

As I. approached Syracuse
-Square (where we were staying),
I noticed some customized buses
parked outside our hotel.

”David Lee Roth must be stay-

ing at our hotel again,” I joked."

I was right. A girl in the lobby

asked if I was with the band.
”What band?’lI inquired. ”David
Lee Roth,” she answered.”
A Roth was scheduled to play
that same night at the Syracuse
War Memorial, an arena across
the street from the hotels at Syra-
cuse Square.

The hotels at Syracuse Square
consist of the Hotel Syracuse and
the Hilton Towers. Both share the
same lobby, but are two different

structures connected by a walk- '

way that spans Harrison Avenue.

the sixth floor of the Hilton Tow-
ers — Room 612. We eventually
found out that Roth and his gang
were on the 13th floor in our
building. Roth, specifically, was
in 1305.

The word was out around town
as to just where Roth was staying,
so it was only a matter of time be-
fore his fans began flowing into
the hotel.

Why else would girls dressed
in fishnet stockings and leather
miniskirts be hanging out at the
Hotel Syracuse bar in the middle
of the afternoon?

Most of them would leave dis-
appointed, howéver. The only
band members who made an ap-
pearance in the lobby were
Roth's guitar duo —— lead guitarist

‘Steve Vai and bassist Billy

Sheehan.

It eventually got drastic for
some fans. They combed the
building, looking for Roth. At ap-
proximately 5:45 p.m., there was
a knock on our door. _I peeked
through the peep hole in the door
and there were three girls stand-
ing on the other side holding
roses. ~ ~ _

I thought to myself: ’.’I know
who these girls are looking for.”

I opened the door -and said:
”Can,| help you?”

All three looked past me into
the room. ”I’m sorry,” one said,

”we thought you were somebody a

else.” a
”Are you looking for David Lee

_ Roth?” I asked; :

.”Do you know where he is?”
was the reply I got.

idea of my live-in poring over

of our erotic life. But in practice,

cause after he moved in, our sex
life deteriorated; we had sex
about once a week, probably

- every eight days. . —

At the same time, his private

I life with the skin mags went on

as usual, and I felt neglected and
edged out by those naked, glossy
women. I threatened to walk out,
and he threw away all the maga-
zines. I moved to another town
to take a better job, and he be-
gan to buy them again — explan-
ing that he was deprived of me.

He is planning to move to
where I am, and I foresee another
struggle to get rid of those maga-
zines. By now I know my attitude
is wrong, but I have had such a

‘ ' bad association with erotic maga-

zines and his solo sex that I can't
help getting into a rage when I
think of it. Maybe counseling or

couple therapy will help us, but-

men to accept this behavior in

so much resentment in his part-
ner. When the mutual pleasure
gets to be scarce and he is going
into a sex fantasy by himself all
the time, it is "something else.
You are right to be troubled,
but you seem to go to some
lengths to keep a man whose, be-
havior disappoints "and angers
you. Or are you just giving in to
his need for you, by considering
that he come and live with you

If you really want to keep the
relationship, or if you are con-
fused about what you want and
just don't need to be pushed into
a sudden decision, I suggest that
you see a counselor before he

‘ moves in with you again. Maybe

this relationship is really over
now, but you haven't accepted
that. Maybe you blame the maga-
zines and his fantasy life for other
things you don't like about him.

You are certainly not a peculiar
woman just because you don't
like the attention he gives those

he is definitely avoiding sex with
you, or even avoiding talk with

the band.

They even said they had been
standing outside of our room for
20 minutes, listening.

By now, I had heard it all. It
was time to go to the Carrier
Dome for the game anyway, so
we were off.

When we returned, the hotel
was jumping, but not because Pitt
had knocked off Syracuse. Roth's
concert would soon be over, and
the 20-plus girls waiting for his
return to the hotel knew exactly
that.

Hillgrove (the student, not the
television personality) was not
going to miss Roth this time. He
and Randy Miller, who covered,
the game for the Greensburg

Tribune—Review, parked them-_

selves in a strategic-place in the
lobby. '

Roth was supposed to go out to
eat after dinner, then return to the
hotel briefly and get on to the
next town. His security team, in
the meantime, got all the atten-
tion and every member loved it.

They were stationed every-
where. Noone was permitted

happily living with or married to
such women. But such happy
men have rich fantasy lives that
go on without specifically erotic
pictures, reading or movies, or at
least tactfully keeping discreet
about employing such material.
‘What sexual therapy has to say
about male or female sex fantasy
is that it is always part of sexuali-
ty and that magazines published
for the purpose of aiding such
-fantasy often contributes good to
a relationship. Rather than lead-
ing to avoidance of sex or affec-
tion with a partner, using such
material may improve it.

I would not be surprised to
hear from you, some day, that in
a happier relationship with
another man your whole attitude
toward this has changed. In a
relationship where you feel loved
and wanted in almost every way
that you want to be, the man's
part—time interest in sexually

specific material may seem less _ .

threatening to you.

- If you can sort out the problems
in this relationship and find much
in it that you want to save, then
some therapy might prove help-
ful in bringing back some of the
joy you have had with this man
or in finding new pleasures with
him neither of you have known
before. But first, get straight in

your mind whether you really.

" ”You pick up the gun and hold it to your head,” Tizzard said.

I ”We’ve designed it so that you listen through one part of it and

you talk into another part of it.”

Tizzard said that the gun has been worked on so that it can-
not actually fire bullets. ”But'if you like, you can put in a real
clip with fake bu|lets,” hesaid. '

He admitted that, until the idea catches on with the public,
people are going to be surprised when they see the initial buy-
ers of the product using it. a '

’’It will be a little shocking to walk into a room and see some-
one holding a gun to his head, talking into it,” Tizzard said.
“But, like anything else, the public will get used to it.”

The gun telephone is scheduled to wholesale for $101 and i

to retail for $175, Tizzard said. He is confident that there are
enough gun lovers in America to make the product a big hit.

”There is a gun being purchased every five seconds, even —
as we talk,’’ he said. ”I read that in a magazine. I can't prove " ~

it. I think that includes over-the-counter and black-market [sales].

But the point is, there is a pretty amazing market out there for ‘

guns.” .
”My dad is at a gunshow in Las Vegas right now, showing
the gun telephone around. When he gets back we should know

I

Asked why anyone would want to own a telephone made

out of a gun, Tizzard said: ”The same reason people like Ker-

mit the Frog telephones. There are people who love Kermit the
Frog, and there are people who love handguns.” ' ’

He saidhe is getting a little tired of the popular misconcep-
tion that guns kill people. '

”Guns do not kill people,” Tizzard said. ”People kill peo-
ple. In some cases, guns are the weapons that are used -to kill
people. In some cases knives are the weapons. In some cases
ropes are the weapons.” 5 '

He said he sees no problem with the idea of children talking

into the" gun telephone.

”It’s completely safe for children,” he said. ’’It would be to _

the parent's advantage to explain theproduct to the child. The
parent could simply tell the child that the gun is like a regular
telephone. You hold it to your head and you talk into it.”
Tizzard said that he is especially proud of the sound quality
of the gun telephone. ’ -

’’It’s really excellent,” he said. ”You can have a good,.clear .

conversation talking through the gun.” -

Asked h_ow he thought friends ands relatives of victims of I

handgun violence would react to the new product, Tizzard said:
”I really hadn't given-much thought to that.” -

At the National Coalition to Ban Handguns in Washington,
however, President Michael K. Beard has given the matter some
thought.

”On one hand, you can look at this and say that it is one of

the dumber things we have heard of.” Beard said. ”But when

you think about it seriously, you wonder what kind of message '

it gives out, especially to children.

”It seems to me that this is just one more part of the cheapen-
ing of the public’s attitude toward handguns. The gun lobby
likes to say that a handgun is just another household product,
like a Cuisinart. This adds to that attitude. It says to the [that]
public ’a handgun js as safe as your telephone.’ When you start
making telephones out of guns, you are making guns seem like
just one more innocuous consumer product." _

At S.W. Productions, Tizzard is convinced that the people
toward whom he is marketing the gun telephone will not pay
much attention to that kind of nay—saying.

”There are a lot of us shooters out here,” he said. ”There are
a lot of us who love guns and can appreciate the beauty of a
well made gun. , .

”We think there is going to be a big market for the gun tele-
phone, and we have no reason to think that it won't be very
succesful.”

U.S. military more

han ever

By Jack Burkman

Staff Writer

The U.S. armed forces are bet-
ter and more prepared now than
at any other time in history, ac-
cording to Gen. Duane H. Cassi-
dy, commander-in—chief ‘of
Military Aircraft Command.

Cassidy said the greatest
strength of the U.S. military is its
high state of readiness.

”We have the capacity to move
forces anywhere in the world,
even without diplomatic clear-
ances,” Cassidy said at a securi-

_ty colloquium on campus

Tuesday night.

An integral component of this
readiness, according to Cassidy,
is the airlift command. He con-
tended that on—the—spot effective-

.ness 'lS the true measure Of

 

current U.S. military worth.

’’I think we need to continual-
ly improve our capacity to solve
problems quickly,” he said. ”The
public no longer tolerates the
idea of a protracted conflict.”

Cassidy said he believes recent
improvements in the military to
be the result of a joint effort of the
public and President Reagan.

’’I attribute gains to the presi-
dent and, perhaps more'impor—
tantly, [to] the American people,
who ' have supported his pro-
jects,” he said.

According to Cassidy, the pub-
lic has played anespecially sig-
nificant role in, the turnaround.

Cassidy pointed out, however,
that a militarysolution is not al-
ways the best answer to a
problem.

”We must always calculate the
price of our action and not just in
monetary terms,” he said.

The latest production at The-

Pittsburgh Public Theater is Or-
phans by the playwright Lyle
Kessler. The script is a delicate-
ly balanced triangle of charac-
ters that exposes the seriousness
of the subject matter, yet keeps
it entertaining. ,

The situation is serious. Two
orphans are fighting to survive in
today's -society. The older
brother is a petty thief who
works the streets to provide for
his uneducated brother.

Treat, the eldest, is a young
man filled with smoldering emo-
tions that erupt violently at the
slightest provocation. He is
hardened by circumstance and

trusts nobody. ’

His brother, Phillip, is quite the
opposite. Phillip is naive and
trusting, but he is only able to ex-
perience the world from behind
a window. ’

Phillip is confined to the house
because Treat is afraid for him
and wants tolprotect him. His
only contact with society is what
he sees an the television.

Phillip’s naivete and imagina-
tion are charming and endear-
ing. His creative comments
lighten up the moodiness of
Treat.

To counterbalance Treat's
rage of emotion and Phillip’s in-
nocence is Harold, a grown-up
orphan. Harold meets Treat in a
bar and immediately identifies
him as a ”dead end kid.”

    
 
    

Even though, she's kind at tacky
looking, Lola Fee is one knowledge-
able person. She knows what's up
with U2, what's down with Black
Flag, and who's coming to town.

see Page I2,

Harold is not struggling finan-
cially, and, even though his bus-

iness is illegal, he otters to
support Treat and Phillip. '

Harold recognizes potential in
both Phillip and Treat. He wants
to harness the emotional energy
churning within Treat and use it
for his own good. He also is
aware of Phillip’s intellect and
his capability to survive in
society.

Harold gives a sense of direc-
tion to the lives at Treat and Phil-
lip. They are able to wander into
new areas of development and,
at the same time, realize that
there is always a placeto come
back to, a" home. _.

The Harold that William Jay
creates is supportive and warm;

By David Zuchowski

The most salient impression
one gets with Sallie Wilson is her
dedication to her career and to
the art of dance. Perhaps devo-
tion is a better word to use here,
for one gets the feeling that her
life's work has been a labor of
love. V

Wilson is currently working
with the Pittsburgh Ballet Theat-
er in its premiere production of
Anthony Tudor's Jardin aux_ Li/as
(Or "Lilac Garden"). Her
credentials are impressive. She
was principal dancer with the
American Ballet Theater; a
faculty member at the Julliard
School of Music and the Man-
hattan School of Dance, and a
company teacher with a multi-
tude of troupes and ballet theat-
ers. She has also danced all of
Anthony TudOr's principal roles
and is especially known for her
dramaticinterpretation of these
roles.

The following is taken from a
recent interview. '

Q.: Since T936, when Tudor
first choreographed Jardin aux
U/as to the music of Chausson's
Poeme, critics have considered

' it to be one of the masterpieces

of contemporary ballet. What is
it that makes Jardin so special?

A.: Well, it as very innova-
tive for its time. Mr. Tudor went
off in a different direction from
what other choreographers
were doing. And today, Jardin
is still innovative and different,
which is one Of the reasons that
it's lived so long. Jardin is differ-

ent in that it's not soley based on '
;_,.,_physical- dancing as much as it's —'
- 1’ an attempt to convey feelings ‘

and emotions by having the

_ characters developed and ex-
"plained through movement.
Q.: How important are facial ‘

-'1"|-iE_ PITT NEWS, Friday, January .30, 1987 '

features in conveying these
emotions your referring to?

A.: l feel that your face should
reflect what you're thinking or
feeling. So you shouldn't try to
set an expression on your face.
Rather, these features come out
through movement, and if you
can feel as a dancer what the
character must be feeling, then
you'll have the right facial ex-
pression.

As a actor studies a role, he
finds the way to say the words,
not as he might say them, but as
the character might say them.
Similarly, in Jardin, the dancers
have to explore the characters
and dance in the way those per-
sons might speak.

Q.: When you danced in
Jardin, did your performance
vary from night to night depend-
ing on the -mood you brought to

the stage?

A.: No, because each night I
went on stage l played the same

‘character. It's not that each time

I went on stage I attempted to
express myself. On the contrary,
I tried to express the feelings of
the girl..l portrayed. There [is] no
artistic license dancing in a
Tudor ballet, because you [are]

bound by the character you try ‘

to become."
' Q.: But didn't the role evolve

"over a period of time, from per-

formance to performance?

. A.: No, the performances
didn't really vary. They might
have gotten better and more
true, however. ln all of Tudor's
ballets, he choreographed eve-
rything-from finger movements to
the smallest of details. The

dancer- wasn't free ‘to put her-

Own interpretation into his
works, and that's what's so
difficult about him. For, in many
ballets, the dancers are given
only the structure to work with

An interview with one of ballet's

and along with it, a lot of lee-
way to dance the way they feel
the role should bedanced.
Q.: What else can you say
about Jardin that makes it so
special? '
A. l'd.have to say that Jardin
was a perfect ballet. lt’s totally
devoid of filler, spaces with un-
necessary movements. it's a per—
fectly woven ballet, one that
meshes beautifully with the mus-

ic. That is why it's considered to .

be a treasure among dancers,
one that's a privilege to be in.

Q.: You're here at Pittsburgh
Ballet Theater "setting" the
ballet. What does that mean
exacﬂy?

.A.: What l'm doing is teach-
ing the dancers the ballet as Mr.

Tudor taught it to me, teaching V

them how to dig for their charac-
ters. Because it's so different
from other works, the dancers
have to think as well as dance.
Not only do they have to be
physical, they have to be intelli-
gent as well. That's why it's a
rare ballet. ~

Q.: .What‘references do you
use to set the ballet?

A.: l do have. a video tape
that I use if l have a question my-
self, but l know the work so well
— l've set it about l 0 times now
— that it's locked in my head by

‘now. By setting the ballet, l'm

acting as a regisseur — being in

charge of rehearsing, teaching,

and having ultimate responsibil-
ity for the ballet.

Q.: What motivates someone
like yourself to choose a career
in the arts rather -than pursue
something more solid and eco-

nomicallypromising like medi-

cine, law or business?

A.: Well, when l was l2,
dancing was something I want-
ed to do. At that time I also
played the violin and cello, but

I

most versatile dancers

I decided that I wanted to dance
more than anything else. l didn't
think about the money or be-
coming a star.

A lot of young people decide
to become dancers but, after a
few years, they go on and do
something else. But I never got
distracted.

Dancing involved a lot of dis-
cipline; it's painful and exhaust-
ing. lt involves a lot of hard
work. The main reward is know-
ing that you've danced well.

Many people think that an ar-

tistic career involves a sacrifice.’

l don't think of it in that light, be-
cause it's the most wonderful life

 

_I could ever imagine. My whole -

career was very exciting. I got
to do everything I meant to do.
l'm still involved in dance, and
I still love it. How many people
can say that, after devoting their
whole life to a career, they still
love their work?

THINK VISUAL
The Kinks
M05 Records

By John Young

Ray Davies found a lot to be
angry about when he began
writing songs in the early '60s,
and unscrupulous businessmen
("A Well Respected Man"),
conformists (”Dedicated Follow-
er of Fashion”) and the ignorant
middle class ("l\/lr. Pleasant”) all
incurred his wrath.

Needing some solace,
though, Davies tempered his
venom over time with songs of
escape, from his insightful clas-

sic ”Waterloo Sunset" to up-
beat rockers like ”Apeman" and
’’In A Foreign Land."

The latest album from The
Kinks, Think Visua/, finds Ray Da-
vies less convinced than ever,
though, about the value of es-
cape and angrier than he's
seemed in years.

In ”Welcome To Sleazy

Man,” we get an urban portrait ‘

where only malls, parking lots
and offices — and the corpora-
tions that own them — are real.

But Davies seems to consider
this a too often overlooked real-
ity; ”The Video Shop” shows
how fantasy lets us ignore hard-
ships like the breakdown of fa-
milies and unemployment, and
Think Visua/’s title song notes the
artificially elevated importance
of images and profits.

Clearly we solve nothing by‘

simply running away from
what's wrong in contemporary
society.

Davies combines his lyrical in-
sights on Thin/< Visua/ with plenty
of infectous melodies. ”Natural
Gift," highlighted by lan Gib-

bons’ piano lines in the chorus,

sounds bright and clean and
features one of the LP’s more op-
timistic lyrics. The bouncy, rock-
ing ”Repitition” is trademark
Kinks pop rock, and ”Working
At The Factory" kicks along to
a heavy, crackling snare beat.

Dave Davies’ two contribu-
tions to Think Visua/ fall short of
brother Ray-’s work. ”Rock ’N’
Roll Cities,” a cynical look at
touring and record promotion,
never really says much and is
probably most interesting in that
it features Dave singing some
non—falsetto passages that make
him sound surprisingly like,his
brother. _

”When You Were A Child”
fares better, calling for a return
to innocence in one woman's
life.

Not every track on Think
V/'sua/ is as fiery and as memora-
ble as every other. But when
you're talking about a band this
tight instrumentally and a song-
writer as aware and as skillful as
Ray Davies, even relatively
weak tracks on this record com-
pare well with a lot of other
music.

subtle, yet powerful, hooks. No
instrument played on a song sim-
ply takes up space by doing,
note—for-note, the same work as
another. Instead, instruments
come and go in songs, building
sweeping, dynamic passages.

Never does a drum machine

click on, a synthesizer drones‘

mechanically and the band
sounds like they might as well go
for coffee while their instruments
rumble on. »

The album's title song opens
the record and right away
demonstrates what the band
does best. "The Sounding’s"

verses build into bright, enliven-

ing choruses, and the song's
parts are bridged by well-
placed guitar and piano in-
terludes.

”A Sun Will Sing," with lyrics
adapted from e.e. Cummings,
features an interesting dynamic
shift as verses are stressed over
the chorus; effective choral sing-
ing by the band takes the song
into the fade.

"The Long Winter” could eas-
ily become overwrought or lean
toward sentimentality, but it
proves to be one of the LP’s
strongest tracks. Guitarist
Stephen lvlorrison delivers the
right amount of emotion in his
vocals just by singing what's
there for him already — well-
crafted lyrics and an engaging
melody.

Harvey Coblin singsithe al-A

bum's other eight songs, dra-
matically delivering. many fine
lyrics. ”Sirens" contains some of

I the best, using alliteration and

repitition of sound in poetic

‘fashion: /’v,e seen hurt, and I've

heard their /ies  A// great fire
surrounds me/A// the sirens
around me/loo/< like you /oo/<
tonight. \

The Sounding has its weak-

nesses, however. ”The Fall" V

never sounds as dark or as tense
as it could; and "Walk Into The
Night” seems too reserved, full
of missed opportunities to cut
loose.

in the mix, Ken Zenkevich’s
on—target drumming ‘sometimes
sounds too quiet and muddy,
and Eric Riebling’s stylish bass
work too often gets buryed.

But The Sounding has too

much going for it to let some

minor distractions stand in the
way of it being an excellent al-
bum. The Affordable Floors write

.and play songs too thoughtful to

be overlooked for long; discover
for yourself a local band with
far-reaching_potential.

Star Trek IV:
The Voyage Home

How much fun can any one
person have at a movie? The
producers of the newest install-
ment in the Star Trek sagaseem
anxious to find out. They have
included more all-out fun in Star
Trek /Vthan one is likely to see-
in another movie for a long time.
The ads thathave been circulat-
ing are true. If you are one of
those people who has never
seen a Star Trek movie, then this
is the one to see.

Leonard Nimoy directed
again — he also did Star Trek II/.-
The Search for Spock _— and
proves that there is more to him
than pointed ears and a differ-
ent way of looking at the world.
He brings the Star Trek crew

home to the late 20th century_

and contrasts space and Earth
marvelously. One especially
memorable sequence is the ‘im-
agery associated with time trav-
el. lt is a unique approach.

The entire acting troupe is in

top form. William Shatner seems
to be immune to the aging
process and leads his crew with

an exuberance akin to someone

much younger. The character of
Spock is approached from a
slightly different angle this time,
as he struggles to regain his
memory lost in the last movie.
The real comic genius in this film
is DeForrest Kelly playing Dr.

. ”Bones" McCoy. His attitude

and comments, most notably
directed toward Spock, are
hilarious.

The main reason that this film"
works is that it does not take it-

i self too seriously.‘ The crew is

trying to save the world from/to-
tal destruction, but that is not,
oddly enough, the center of the
film. Human relationships are im-
portant, not special effects or
world obliteration. This is a truly
enioyable movie, and it is what
Hollywood should try to create
more of: a likeable film with like-
able.characters in a fun, if rather
trying, situation.

On a scale of l to lO, this
movie rates a 9.

 

r

The Golden? Child

Eddie Murphy is the’ funniest
man in America. -

In all four of his previous roles,
he was considered by many to
be a comic genius, especially in
Bever/y I-//'//s Cop and Trading
P/aces. He filled the roles of Axle
Foley and Billy Ray Valentine
with a cockiness seldom seen in
actors. He smart—mouthed
whomever he pleased and got
away with it because he was so
confident and personable.

lt has gotten so that the very
sight of Murphy's smile makes
one laugh out loud. This is the
case with The Go/den Chi/d.
The script is weak and so are
many of the supporting actors.
But Murphy dominates the silver
screen so that those aspects .of
the film simply do not matter. The
script is strong enough that Mur-

phy has no problem carrying the

entire weight of it by himself. The
people who surround him are
good enough so that theirflaws
are not obvious. In short, the film
is a great vehicle for this out-
standing comedian.

The film does not quite com-
pare to either Trading P/aces, 48
Hours or Bever/y Hi//s Cop, but
it does have its merits. lt finally
takes Murphy to someplace out-
side the United States, and his
humor is just as effective in Tibet
as it is in Detroit. It also lets Mur-
phy interact with several amus-
ing characters, whom he makes
us laugh at without being con-
descending. The film also pro-

Brighton Beach

Memoirs

Neil Simon is back! The
newest fodder he has created
for theater audiences to chew
on is supposedly autobiographi-

cal. His movies are almost al— ‘
. ways written from his plays.

Brighton Beach Memoirs is no
exception. This lon —running
comedy delighte many
theater-goers in New York City
before being sold to a major
studio.

As usual, Simon has inserted
many snide, quick comebacks to
speckle his characters with hints
of genuine wit. In so many of his
scripts he presents characters
who seem too angelic for their
own good. Everyday people
iust do not act the way Simon

writes them.

It has gotten to the point
where his characters are no
longer cute and endearing, but
dull and annoying. lf Simon can-
not alter his style before his next
movie, then it would be benefi-
cial for all involved to keep it on
paper and away from a. movie
studio.

Walking out of the theater af-
ter viewing Richard Pryor’s new
film, Critica/ Condition, someone
remarked that he didn't know
why someone would even
bother making a movie like that.
It seemed that he was less than
ecstatic about the film.

some points — which are irrele— .

vent and ludicrous — about
hospitals and doctors and the
way that they are treated.
Mostly it wants to be a comedy,
or at least it is advertised that
way, but it is not.

Richard Pryor is not funny. His
mouth was not quite as filthy as
usual, but other characters more
than compensated for this lack of
four-letter words. Pryor was stiff
and appeared to be simply go-
ing through the motions of trying
to be funny.

There have been far too many
movies concerning an escaped
convict who turns out to be a
great leader in a time of crisis,

L, which is what this film is about.

Most of those stories are bad,
but very few as bad as this.

It would be too easy to pick
out all of this film's faults. Suffice
it to say that this movie is ailing,
and nothing is going to revive it.

On a scale of l to lO, this
movie rates a 2.

‘Panthers in 1984; ‘~

 

THE PITT NEWS

By Jim U rban
Editor-in-Chief

When opportunity kno_cks,
Paul Evans answers. ‘ .

The first-year Pittsburgh coach
got his chance to kill the prover-
bial two birds with one stone on
Wednesday night when the Pan-
thers hosted Big East foe Seton
Hall at Fitzgerald Field House.

He took advantage of it.

Evans noticed at halftime that
his team had been out-rebounded
25-19 by the Pirates. The Pan-
thers led 46-33 on the score-
board, but Evans decided to
adjust regardless.

He moved shooting guard Cur-
tis Aiken to the point for most of
the second half. Then he dropped
6-5 small forward Demetreus

Gore in at shooting guard, and he
countered with freshman strong-
man Rod Brookin and senior Tico
Cooper in the frontcourt.
Needless to say, the Panthers
out-rebounded Seton'Hall in the
second half 23-14 and easily dis-
posed of the Pirates, 95-81 in
front of 6,798 fans. _ _
”We moved Demetreus to se-
cond guard so we could get more

rebounding,” Evans said.

And that they did. The bonus
came in the fact that several Pan-
thers had the opportunity to play
different positions than they had
been accustomed to playing earli-
er in the year. The players gained
valuable game experience, and

Evans gained some flexibility

with his lineup. —-*
’’I think we are starting to gel,”

By_Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The 11th-ranked Pitt
wrestling team dropped their
first dual meet of the season
last night, 20-19, to Cleveland
State at Fitzgerald Field House.

The Panthers dropped to 8-1
overall and 1-1 in the Eastern
Wrestling League. ‘

”We didn't deserve to win
this one,” said Pitt coach
Rande Stottlemyer. ”When we
needed some points, our guys
couldn't pull them out.”

’ A couple of early Pitt losses
gave the Vikings a 7-3 lead,
which opened the door for the
win. But CSU still had to, face

5 the heart.of the Pitt line up,’-

” "Pat Santoro, Gary Bolin, and
Eric .Wertz.

At 142, Santoro squared off
with the Vikings’ Dan Kelly.
Santoro started the’ match off
slowly, but he picked himself
up at the beginning of the se-
cond period and never looked
back. . - l

' Santoro was able to gain an

extra two points atthe buzzer,

winning the match, .11-3, but,
more importantly, giving Pitt
four team points instead of
three. ' ‘

Bolin and Wertz wrestled
similar matches to give the

-Panthers a solid 14-7 lead. ’’It

makes it easier if the lighter

guys can get a few extra
points,” said Bolin. ’’In a meet
like this, every match is impor-
tant. We let them [CSU] dic-
tate the style, and couldn't
pick up on"mistakes.”

The next match provided a

mild suprise as Pitt's Mike-
Tongel pulled off a super de-
cision at the buzzer, giving the '
Panthers six team points.

next two matches and the
meet came down to the. last

Davis will not be allowed to
enroll at Pitt again until next Janu-
ary and will not be eligible to
play football until the 1988
season. ,

. The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team seems to have found a '

 

home in the basement of the Big’ ’ ' P if

East standings. - _
Wednesday night's 103-68 loss
to the Lady Friars of Providence
College dropped Pitt to 0-9 in the

Providence, last year's regular
season champions in the Big East,-
have now ‘won six consecutive
games, and eight of their last 10.

Providence is 7-2 in the con-’

”Providence is a very tough
team," said Pitt coach Kirk Bruce.

way to an early 17-4 lead. A her-

The Pitt women's gymnastic
team was defeated by the Penn
State Lady Lions 179.7 to 177.15
on Wednesday night at Uni-

Pitt head coach Debbie Yoh-
man said she feels that the girls’
routines were cleaner although
the team score only improved by
.05 since their meet against West
Virginia last Saturday.

”|’ve thought that this is a 180

“Monte swimming like an upperclassman

American

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

Pitt men's swimming coach
Fred _Lewis expected good things
from his freshmen recruits this
year. ~ -

But it is hard for a coach to dis-
tinguish just how significant the
Contributions of those young
recruits will be.

Lewis expected freshman Rob
Monte, a high school All-
in the 500-yard
freestyle and a junior national
finalist in the 1,650-yard
freestyle, 500-yard freestyle and
200—yard butterfly, to comple—
ment Pitt's already strong dis-

tance freestyle program, which
consists of returning junior Geoff
Rife and sophomore Dan‘Langan.

And Monte has, in many ways,
surpassed his coach's expec-
tations.

When Monte won the Iron‘
Man triple — 1,000-yard free-.

style, 500-yard freestyle and the
200-yard butterfly 4- at the com-
petitive Penn State dual meet last
week, he opened many people's

‘eyes to the talent he posesses.

’’l was really surprised by the
way I finished at Penn State,” said
Monte. ’’I worked_ really hard for

it, but luck was also on my side.

As far as goals go, I always try to
swim fast and do the best I possi-

bly can.”

Coach Lewis was especially
surprised by Monte’s first place
finish in the 200—yard butterfly.

”We plan to swim Monte in
different events,” said Lewis. ’’In
the meet against Cleveland State
[Feb. 6], we'll put him in the
200—yard l.M. and in the meet
against Kenyon [Feb. 7], we'll
swim him in the 200-yard
freestyle.”

Sorne wouldthink that switch-
ing events would be hard —- es-
pecially on a freshman, but Lewis
has a theory behind it. ”Switch-
ing events like this will help keep
Monte fresh, and the speed re-

quired for the shorter races will-

in-turn help his speed in the dis-
tance events,” said Lewis.
Monte also likes the idea of
switching events on occasion.
"It's nice once in a while to be
able to concentrate on different
events,” said Monte.’ It's a nice
change of pace, and it keeps you
on your toes.” .
The odds are for Monte to do
well at the Big East Champion-
ships at the end of February.
Coach Lewis said Monte is fa-
vored to finish among the top
three in the events he'll compete
in at the championships.
The most competitive event he
will swim at the Big East Cham-
pionships will be the 500-yard

freestyle, where he must meet the
challenge of his teammates -
freshman Charles Fry, junior
Charles Lersch and senior Tom
Shaulinski-, as well as Villanova’s
top—ranked Chris Craft.

In order to prepare to meet this

. challenge Monte will continue to

train hard, concentrating on qual-
ity speed workouts in practice
and getting more rest.

”The best distance swimmers
are those who can withstand pain
for the longest time,” said Lewis.
’’It really boils down to which
swimmer has the most guts and
can sacrifice the most in practice.

”Many of Monte’s teammates
respect and look up to him for the
hard work he does. He has the
desire to be the best.

”Monte is willing to make the
sacrifices it takes to be one of the

best. He has already taken a gi- .

ant step toward achieving this in
his freshman year,” Lewis con-
tinued.

Monte’s most important char-
acteristic could be that he re-
mains virtually unaffected by the
pressure that usually accompa-
nies success such as his.

”My strategy for success is to
work hard in practice, swim hard
in meets and hope that every-
thing falls into place when it's
supposed to,” said Monte;

Obviously, he's done just that.

”Providence is a fast break
team, we just weren't getting
back on defense,” said Bruce.

The Lady Friars ran up and
down the court outscoring Pitt at
a two to one ratio for most of the
second half. ' ,

Providence senior Mary‘Burke,
among the nation's top scorers
(21.8 ppg), fouled out with eight
minutes remaining in the game.
She left as the game's high scorer
with 23 points, including
10-of—13 from the floor.

With a little less than six
minutes to play, Providence wi-
dened the gap to 41 points, as
they led 90-49. Pitt got no closer
than 93-61, and eventually lost
by 35. .

In the past, Pitt players had
been unhappy with position
changes. Aiken suffered through
three long, confusing seasons un-
der former coach Roy Chipman.
He was shuffled between point
and shooting guard.

Last year, Smith balked when
Chipman asked him to move
from power forward to center.
On Wednesday night, however,

all were happy.

’’I like playing second guard,”

Gore said. ’’I think it is my more ‘

natural position. I felt really
relaxed.”

”We are concentrating on what
we want to do and it is really
coming together,” Aiken added.

Aiken should have more nights _

like Wednesday. Riding the
momentum of Monday night's
victory over Syracuse in the Car-
rier Dome, Aiken fired in 21
points on 10-of-17 shooting.
Gore added 19, Brookin 17 and
Cooper 15. Cooper and Brookin
each added 10 rebounds. Both

\ came off the bench.

”We are eight deep now,"
Evans said. '
”Everybody said we have a

weak bench,” Smith added, ”but

we play eight guys, and most of

the teams we are going to face

play eight people.”
The importance of Brookin and
Cooper 0 Pitt's chances became

10 Pitt track runners
in Millrose Games

By Celeste Phillips

For The Pitt News

Members of the Pitt Panther
track team will be competing
at the Millrose Games in New
York's Madison Square
Garden tonight.

’’In each case, they will be

up against some of the top run-
ners in the country,” said Pitt
coach John Vasvary.~”lt_wiII
not only be collegiate compe-

. tition, but also some of the top

club runners in the country.”

This year, 10 Pitt runners
qualified runners for the meet,
the most ever under Vasvary.
Lee McRae will be competing
in the 60-yard dash; Eric Can-
non in the 60-yard hurdles and
the.'two—miIe and mile relay
teams.

The regular two-mile relay
team, made up of Bob Wein-
er, Joe Daniels, Tim Manes
and Dave Moore, has the
fastest time in the nation this
season at 7:27.02.»

”They will be going against
some top-flight competition
from schoolslike Georgetown
and Villanova, as well as club
teams such as the West
Chester Puma AIl—Stars,” said
Vasvary.

The mile relay has been

somewhat of a thorn in the
Panthers’ side for the last few
years. Although they have
been strong, they have always
had to rely on runners from

the two-mile relay team to fill‘

vacancies.

This year, however, there is
a true mile-relay team. It is
made up ofjesse Mil<e||, Dave

_ Price, Vernon Reed and Alan

former himself, will be going

Laws, and they will be com-
peting in the college section in
the games. _

Price, who is only a fresh-
man, will be a key for the Pan-
thers. While most freshman
may not be up to the
challenge, Vasvary is confi-
dent that Price can handle the
pressure. ‘

”I think he'll be able to ac-
cept the challenge,” Vasvary
said. ”He is a rare freshman — .
the type that steps right in.”

McRae and Cannon, two
All—Americans who once again
qualified for this year's
NCAAS, will probably be
faced with the stiffest compe-
tition. I

McRae, an AII—WorId per-

against Ben Johnson, who is
ranked No. I in the world in
the 100-meter dash.

”Lee will be going against
some great runners, but he is
also considered one of the top
competitors there,” Vasvary
said. ”He has a lot of ex-
perience — national and inter-
national.”

Cannon, in addition totthe
collegiate competition, will be
running against club runners
such as Greg Foster and form-
er Pitt track star Roger
Kingdom. .

”Eric is coming on really
well,” Vasvary said. ”He rises
to the occasion. At last year's
NCAAs he wasn't a favorite,
but he finished fourth. He was
leading until the fourth hurdle,
when he made a mistake. If he
can go without the mistakes,
he'll ‘be in good shape.” .
