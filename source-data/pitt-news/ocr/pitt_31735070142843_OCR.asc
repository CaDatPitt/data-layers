Pitt professor turns education executive

John Manganaro
For The Pitt News

In late August 1961, Jerlean Daniel
hopped on a plane in Sacramento,
Calif, with nothing but a few suitcas—
es of clothes and books. Four hours
and 2,200 miles later, she arrived at
the Pittsburgh International Airport,
collected her bags and immediately
boarded a bus bound for Oakland.

As the bus entered town, emerging
from the semi-darkness ofthe Fort Pitt
Tunnel, Daniel found herselfassailed
by doubt.

The sight of Pittsburgh,‘ a city still

dominated by steel mills and smog,
shocked the California native, barely
two months out of high school. She
wondered whether she had made the
right decisionto attend Pitt and study
political science. ,
“The city looked like somebody
just dug it up and dusted it off a little
bit,” Daniel said. “I couldn’t believe it.
I didn’t know whatl had gotten myself
into.” .
In spite ofher trepidations, Daniel

1 ﬁt in well at Pitt and began an educa-

tional and professional journey that
has spanned four decades, engagingin
multiple disciplines, includingpolitical

science, psychology and sociology.
Most recently, she landed an ex-
ecutive position in the National As-
sociation for the Education of Young
Children 4 a national organization

established to help teachers, council- _

ors and other professionals develop a
base of knowledge about early child-
hood education.

Since 2005, Daniel has served as
the deputy executive director of the
association and heads its professional
development division. As of]uly 1, she
will replace outgoing executive direc-
tor Mark Ginsberg, whowillbecome a
clean at George Mason University.

tion and upcoming promotion, Daniel
served a 21-year career at Pitt, where
sheworkedas chair of the department
of psychology in education and as a
director of the University Child De-
velopment Center.

She accredits much of her profes-
sional success to the inﬂuence of her
parents — civil rights activists who
had high expectations for their chil-
dren, Daniel said.

“I grew up with an expectation
that I would make my own way in the
world,” she said. “My parents always
expected me to go out and ﬁnd my

Buba was one of about 50 people ’

from the organization Save Our Com-W
munity Hospitals who marched to
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’s house
on Devonshire Street this weekend to
give him a letter from Braddock com—
munity oﬂicials. .
But their plan didn’t work out per-
fectly.AUniversity spokesman told the
gatl1erers Nordenberg wasn’t home at
the time. He was traveling, Buba said.
V So Braddock Council member Tina
Doose, who was with the protesters,
delivered the letterto aPitt policeman
atthe door ofNordenberg’s home. The
letter asks Nordenberg, a member of

‘UPMC’s Board of Directors, to delay

closingUPMC Braddockfor18 months.
Thatwould give the communitytime to
ﬁnd another organization to take over
the hospital, according to the letter.

UPMC announced in rr1id—October
that it planned to close its Braddock
Hospitaljan. 31, this Sunday. AUPMC
news release cited declining inpatient
usage by the community and a lack of
return on investment in the hospital.

UPMC lost $27 million overthe past
six years through Braddock Hospital
and could lose far more if the hospi-
tal remained open, according to the
release. .

Academia claps

forapps

Are colleges and universities finally getting

smart about technology?

he past decade has been

I the mobile phone’s. Sleek

and shiny replaced clunky

and cumbersome. With that ad-

vancement came multiple capa-

bilities. With those capabilities
came restrictions.

In days past, teachers scorned
the sight of a phone in school.
Any use of the device _— for tex-
ting or not —— was a cardinal sin.
The culture and atmosphere of
school were at odds with these
small technological gems. A stu-
dent would be perceived as unfo-
cused if caught using one.

But the smartphone is making

a comeback in classrooms, and .

this time with the blessings of
professors. Nationwide, colleges
and graduate schools are embrac-
ing the new technology. They are
embracing the cell phone —- the
iPhone speciﬁcally — for its ver-
satility and technological edge.

In 2009, University of Mis-
souri’s journalism school, the
nation’s oldest, incentivized the
ownership of an iPhone or iPod
Touch, according to US News 8:
World Report. Students would
be eligible for more ﬁnancial
aid if they followed suit. The ad-
ministration’s rationale is that
wielding the phone would make
it more feasible to rewatch lec-
tures, helping to better retain
information.

The phone is being recognized
for its video abilities.

Another school, the University
of Florida College of Pharmacy,
added iPhones or iPod Touches to
its list of requirements. Accord-
ing to the student newspaper, The
Alligator, the College of Pharma-
cy Dean William Riffee said the
administration wants students
“to become adept at using these
mobile devices early on because
[they] see this as the future in
pharmacy practice.” There are

numerous applications that have
uses in the medical ﬁeld.

Finally, academia is catching
up. Help students train with new
technologies instead. Accept that
in the real world, these technolo-
gies do exist, and they will only be
advancing. This kindof method-
ology will assist students in using
these devices professionally.

The medical schools at Ohio
State University and Georgetown
University also require the phone.
Applications like Epocrates help
_identify medications, and some
applications help in learning
anatomy in the preclinical years
of education. , ,

The phone is being recognized
for its software.

Technology is being perceived
as an advantage and not a hin-
drance in the education realm.
Gadgets are no longer simply
sources of distraction, but ve-

hicles to further improve educa-

tion.

More schools that require
training of their students should
embrace the rewards such devic-
es have to offer. They can even
have a hand in collaborating with
software companies to custom-
ize applications for their classes.
Maybe Pitt’s medical school could
sign on to the handheld revolu-
tion. V

The fact that the iPhone has
been the popular choice speaks
to its versatility. If educational
institutions were to pursue in-
tegrating more technology into
their curricula, there might be
more competition between sup-
pliers and a different trend in
tasks the phones could perform;
maybe more universal compat-
ibility with ﬁle—types.

It is hard to escape the techno-
logical aspect of life in America.
Instead of ﬁghting the wave‘, ride
the wave and beneﬁt.

Pleasure, guilty or genuine?

We all have guilty pleasures, — it just takes guts to recognizeit

   

Katie Azzara
Columnist

You can tell a lot about us by examin-
ing our guilty pleasures, which might
explain why we conceal them from
one another.

Though most are harmless,
guilty pleasures can be embarrass-
ing, awkward and just plain bad for
you. I’m talking about things like
“For the Love of Ray]” or PerezHil-
ton.com.- These pursuits probably
aren’t great for you, and you prob-
ablywouldn’t reveal them to arecent
acquaintance, but no real damage
is done by secretly taking pleasure
in them.

But at what point do things that.

begin as guilty pleasures become a
person’s actual interests? This can
happen to the best of us. Consider
the example of my relationship
with Lady Gaga, pop star extraor-
dinaire. '
When she ﬁrst appeared on the
music scene, she was a crazy singer
who wore insane costumes. Her

song “Just Dance”"was my guilty

pleasure. I just couldn’t get enough
of it, despite some embarrassment

and my chasm-like separation be- i

tween pop music and the words
“quality art form.”

But somewhere between “Poker
Face” and “Paparazzi,” a real rela-
tionship between Gaga and me

’ grew. And when “Bad Romance”

came along, it was ofﬁcial: She had

‘interest shift. Shows like .“The Hills,”

or more recently “Jersey Shore,”
always seem to start out as guilty
pleasures, or maybe even as shows
that one watches simply to makefun
of the characters and their situations
—— no pun intended.

But inevitably, we begin to care
about these characters, and what
was once a guilty pleasure becomes

66  

But atyvhat point do things that begin
as  pleasures becomea person’s

actuallinterests?

become one of my favorite musical
artists, and now there is nothing
guilty about the pleasure I get from
listening to her. ,.
Reality television exempliﬁes
another occurrence of the pleasure-

hard to live without. A missed epi-
sode means not just a missed op-
portunity to indulge in our guilty
pleasures, but also an unexpected
sense of emptiness and disappoint-

‘ ment. } 7

Friends say Facebook is guiltiest pleasure

Azzara 4 4

Of course, some things must
forever remain guilty pleasures,
because openly liking “Hannah
Montana” and the Jonas Brothers
as a college student will never be
socially acceptable. But most people
will even admit to those silly little
indulgences. The kinds of guilty
pleasures that we really don’t want
people to know about — that it
would be legitimately humiliating if
people were to ﬁnd out about —— are

of a somewhat different nature.

I asked my friends, and they
agreed that their guiltiest pleasure
is Facebook. You might be thinking
about those silly Social Interview
questions, or applications like Farm-
Ville, but most of the people that I
questioned admitted that the guilti-
est pleasure of all is using Facebook
proﬁles as a tool to stalk people they
barely know.

We’ve all done it, and we all have

our different reasons. We may be
entertained by the pictures of par-
ticularly well-dressed or fun—loving
people, or perhaps we’re enthralled
by the status updates of our especial-
ly philosophically inclined Facebook
friends, or we might simply want to
see how people’s lives have changed
since we last saw them.

But if these people, who fall
somewhere between acquaintances

our stalking abilities, things would
get really weird really fast. Maybe
the thrill that we get from being fully
aware of how creepy we are is part of
the reason we indulge in this guilti-
est of pleasures.

But as long as we can admit our
guilty pleasures to ourselves, there’s
not any real harm done. Everyone
needs some way to indulge his or her
innermost desires, and if listening to
Lady Gaga or clicking through 400

pictures of someone you’ve never
met fulﬁlls even a little of that desire,
I say it’s a healthy thing.

It’s best to accept our guilty plea-
sures, even if we don’t feel entirely
comfortable disclosing them to the
world, because we’ve all got a little
secret weirdness inside of us. Who
knows what would happen if we
didn’t have these harmless ways of
expressing it.

Oscar watch: ‘HurtLocker’ contends

Patrick Wagner
Staff Writer

“The Hurt Locker”

Starring: Jeremy Renner,
Anthony Mackie, Brian
Geraghty

Directed by: Kathryn Bigelow
Grade: A-

A deﬁning moment in the leg-
acy of any armed conﬂict is the

apparition of a war ﬁlm dealing
with the upheaval.

With Korea there was
“M.A.S.H.,” with Vietnam, a
slew of ﬁlms including the clas-
sics “Apocalypse Now!” and “The
Deer Hunter” and with the ﬁrst
Gulf War, the terribly underrated
“Three Kings.”

With the incredible emotional
involvement of the United States’
latest conﬂicts, a ﬁlm like “The
Hurt Locker” was due.

This hard—boiled thriller about
a U.S. bomb disposal unit in Iraq
isn’t about Victory or defeat, but
the human casualties created
among American troops.

The ﬁlm follows the actions
of an E.O.D. (Explosive Ordnance
Disposal) team and its attempts
to disarm enemy explosives while
trying to survive the last weeks of
deployment. ’

When met by its brash new com-
mander, Staff Sgt. William James

Courtesy Summit Entertainment

(played with tasteful insanity by
Jeremy Renner), the team mem-
bers, consisting of Sgt. Sanborn,
Specialist Eldridge and others,
move through a series of events
that have serious consequences
both for their particular detach-
ment and for themselves.

Though seemingly always bold
in the face of danger, James’ conﬁ-
dence turns suicidal when a local
boy he has befriended goes miss-
ing.

Acting on his gut, he ﬁnds him-

, self in the middle of Baghdad and

barely escapes what would be self-
inﬂicted death.

Tensions rise within the team
and James’ attitude conﬂicts with
the desire of both Sanborn and
Eldridge to get home.

With the team decimated —
emotionally and physically —
James and Sanborn undertake a
ﬁnal mission as an unwilling hos-
tage comes to a U.S. military check-
point asking for help to remove the
bomb that terrorists have strapped
to his body.

W James attempts to disarm the
explosive device but is unable to
help the man. Instead, he gets hit
with pavement fragments kicked

» up by the blast of the man’s chest-

strapped bomb.

Sent home to safety, James ﬁnds
himself unsatisﬁed, and the ﬁlm
ends with his grinning on a mili-

tary tarmac, once again in Iraq.

Other ﬁlms have attempted to
create patriotic paragons or pure-
ly anti-war meatheads, but “The
Hurt Locker” attempts to simply
tell the story of real people who
ﬁnd themselves in extraordinary
circumstances, and it succeeds
beautiﬁilly.

James isn’t an easy character
to understand, but that realistic
characterization plays into the re-
ality that “The Hurt Locker” tries
to demonstrate.

The realism that the ﬁlm has
been touted for is, if anything, an
understatement. The atmosphere
is overwhelming, with each shot
looking more like Iraq than even
what Iraq might very well look
like.

Every frame acts as a detailed
portrait, and down to the small-
est component, the production is
incredible. ,

Perhaps being too much of a
good thing, the pacing in certain
parts could improve to keep the
action high, but this remains un-
noticeable for the most part.

In a year with multiple ﬁlms de-
serving of accolades, “The Hurt
Locker” takes an original and
artistically rich look at a current
crucible of humanity.

Although, we will have to see if
this is the greatest war movie, it
certainly is a candidate.

‘Old Life’ nothing new

Goodbye Old Life

Pop/Punk

Paciﬁc Ridge Records

Rocks Like: All Time Low, The
Morning Light, Blink—182
Grade: B-

Fans of All Time Low, The
Morning Light and Blink—182 will
ﬁnd something worth listening to
in Echo Screen’s latest release,

Goodbye Old Life.

This album is the third release
for the four Brick, N.J., natives fol-
lowing 2o05’s An American Tale
EP and 20o6’s full-length album,
Euphoria.

The band channels its inner
Taking Back Sunday with “The
Ballad of Jack Shephard (Battle
Chorus)” and pays homage to
Blink—182 without mimicking with
its cover of “First Date.”

The album follows the ever-
growing trend of alternative pop/
punk bands that institutions like
the Vans Warped Tour helped fuel.

The problem with this is that, be-

cause the music caters to the pre-

dictable tastes of emotional scen-
esters, it won’t surprise you.

Echo Screen sounds too much
like the work of its peers, and as a
result, the album fails to set itself
apart. ,

Overall, the album proves that
the band has deﬁnite potential,
but the band makes up for its lack
of experience with quirky lyrics
and original melodies. The CD will
pique your interest, but if you’re
expecting something fresh and
new age, keep looking.

National spotlight not pinning down Panthers

Ranked No. 18 in the NCAA, the Pitt wrestling team is focusing on a national title

Ben Duignan
Staff Writer.

On Dec. 12, the Pitt men’s wres-
tling team renewed its rivalry with
Penn State at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

It was the ﬁrst time the Pan-
thers and the Nittany Lions met on
the mat since the 2004-05 season,
when Pitt was ranked No. 25 and
-Penn State No. 16. Penn State took
that match, 26-19.

This season, Pitt found itself
in a similar situation. The No. 24
Panthers were ready to face the
No. 14 Nittany Lions. The results,
however, would be different this
time.

Pitt didn’t get the victory, but
neither did Penn State. The teams
tied, 19-19.

“We were upset we didn’t get
the win,” junior heavyweight Ryan
Tomei said. “But it showed that we
could wrestle with the best. I think
a lot of guys on the team realized
we were legitimate contenders.”

Despite not getting the victory,
assistant coachjason Peters thinks
the contest was a turning point in
the season.

“We let the match slip away,”

he said. “We were all disappointed
we didn’t get the win, but Ithink it
helped fuel the team.”

Since that mid-December con- ’

test, the Panthers haven’t lost a
match and now rank No. 18 in the
nation. They are 13-1-1 overall and
haven’t lost in their three Eastern
Wrestling League matches.

Coming off wins over Penn and
conference foe Cleveland State this
past weekend, Pitt is enjoying its
most successful season in recent
memory.

Head coach Rande Stottlemyer
believes the source of the team’s
success stems from a change in the
culture of Pitt wrestling.

“The guys are starting to buy
into the process of what it takes
to compete at the Division I level,”
Stottlemyer said. “In order to be
the best you have to wrestle 365
days a year, you can never stand
still.”

Stottlemyer’s approach is get-
ting across to the wrestlers.

“The coaches bustour butt.
They push us hard” Tomei, the
seventh-ranked heavyweight in
the NCAA, said. “You have to work
hard and the guys are starting to
understand what it takes to get
stronger and tougher. We’re ﬁgur-

ing out what it takes to win.”
Tomei believes the hard work
and dedication is what is taking
this team to the next level.
“We may not have the most tal-
ented wrestlers in the country,”
he said, “but I know this team is

 

in better shape than almost any
other team we play. That’s because
the wrestlers are buying into the
system.” . ~

As the team embraces this men-
tality, the results have been show-
ing on the wrestling mat.

The_Panthers haven’t lost since
Nov. 15, when they fell to Lehigh,
24-9. The only other blemish ona

potential undefeated record since '

then was the draw against Penn
State. With one more win, Pitt can
tie a school-record 14 dual-match

 
  

Luc Felakl STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

With the help of heavyweight Ryan Tomei (above), who is ranked seventh nationally in his weight class,
the wrestling team is off to a good start this season. The Panthers" are 13-1-1 and rank No. 18 in the NCAA.

Pitt breaks 15 records in rout

Women lead the way with 10 records set

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

The City Game between Pitt and

Duquesne’s swimming and div-.

ing teams might not receive the
hype that the basketball rivalry
1 does, but that didn’t slow down

“the Panthers, who had an excel-

lent showing at the home of the
Dukes on Saturday.

“We don’t have a rivalry in
swimming like in basketball,”
head coach Chuck Knoles said.

“We compete with Duquesne
because it makes an easy travel
meet against a Division I oppo-

nent.”

While the Panthers were tech-
nically the away team, both the
men’s and women’s teams se-
cured victories and set several
Duquesne pool records in the
process.

“We had a load of good
swims,” Knoles said. “The ladies

_ walked away from the meet with

ten Towers Pool records and the
men set ﬁvepool records.”
Senior Ryann Kishbaugh,
named Performer of -the Meet
for Pitt, contributed two re-
cord-setting swims in both the
100-meter (57.46 seconds) and
200—meter backstroke events for

l the women, who beat the Dukes

199.5-60.5. A

-Kishbaugh helped lead other
young members of the women’s
team to ﬁnd their way into the
history books, as three freshman
swimmers broke Duquesne pool
records.

In a performance similar to

Kishbaugh’s, freshman Kelsey
Herbst also set local pool records
with victories in the 1000-me-
ter (10:08.28) and 500-meter
(4:59.22) freestyle races.

Recently, junior Laura Barnes ,

was named Big East Swimming
and Diving Female Athlete of
the Week, and she continued her

success in the 100—meter breast-
stroke, winning the event in a
pool—record time.

Still, Knoles believes that
there is room for improvement
in Barnes’ swimming.

“I was pleased with the re-
cord, but it was a bit off of where
she and I thought she would be,”
Knoles said. “She is focused on
the Big East Conference Champi-
onships at this point of the sea-

son and preparing to swim fast .

enough there to make the NCAA

- Championships.”

“The men’s squad defeated
Duquesne 161-99 and also had its

share of stellar performances.

of Duquesne

Freshman Adam Maczewski’s
50.05 time in the 100—meter
backstroke not only set a pool

, record, but also qualiﬁed as a

top—10 Big East finish in that
event. 0 _ .

In a meet where the Panthers
dominated the Dukes, the men’s
relay teams opened and closed
the day with record-setting vic-
tories.

The 200-meter medley relay
team, consisting of Maczewski,

Jon Buchanan, Jake Lucas, and L

Andrzej Dubiel, won the ﬁrst
event of the day (1:32.84).

— “We are swimming very well

have most of the year,” he said.
Both Panther squads will com-

meet that Knoles claims will test
the team’s “mental toughness.”
“We are a bit mentally weak at
times, but we have made big im~

this point last year.” .

"Tomei: ‘I Want to be a

national champion’

A Winning 4 8

victories in one season.

The young talent of this Pitt
team has especially been impres-
sive this season.

Freshman Anthony Zanetta
recently broke into the top 10 for
wins by a freshman. His stellar
26-8 record for the year ties him

i for 10th on the all-time Pitt win
list for freshman.

Fourteen of the 26 players list-
ed on the roster are freshman or
sophomores, including the one-
two punch of sophomore middle-
weights Tyler Nauman and Matt
Wilps.

The latest collegiate rankings
put Nauman and Wilps at No. 18
in the 141- and 197—pound weight
classes, respectively.

While this team has undoubt-
edly exceeded expectations this

season, the pieces seem to be in’

place for success in the long run.
“We’re deﬁnitely headed in the
right direction,” Stottlemyer said.
“We have a good recruiting class
coming in. We have young guys

ready to step up. I think we have a
great nucleus of wrestlers here.”

Tomei agrees-that the program
is laying the foundation for future
success.

“We have kids on this team that
are willing to dedicate themselves
to wresting for four or ﬁve years,”
he said. “We have backups that
want to get better and are waiting
for their opportunity to step in.”

The Panthers will play four
more matches before the EWL
championships in March and the
NCAA championships that take
place a couple of weeks later.

Tomei believes that, while the" “I

team shouldbe proud of what it’s
done to get to this point, even
loftier goals should help fuel the
team to compete over the second
half of the season. .

“Everyone _has to stay focused
and keep wrestling hard,” said
Tomei. “I don’t know what other
people’s goals are but mine is
simple: I want to be a national
champion.” L
