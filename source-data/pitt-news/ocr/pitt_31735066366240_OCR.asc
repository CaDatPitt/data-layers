On Activities Fair

By KAREN TOKAR

, “There is more to offer this year, and less people,” was
the general reaction to this year’s two day Activities Fair.
 The Fair sported 32 booths with displays ranging from an
. array of international flags at the Quo Vadis booth to the
,. flashing color slides at the booth of the Pitt Players.

portant part in student activ-
ities.” ,_

“Out of the people that have
been here the response is good,”
stated, Stu Arnheim at the Ski
Club booth, “but I’m not as satis-
ﬂed with this year’s response.”

One Liberal Arts freshman
that “once you’re here it’s inter-
esting and persuasive, but it
wasn't played up a lot. . . . I
didn’t know exactly what, it was
at ﬁrst.”

The only expressed unfavor-

able reaction to the Fair was

pronounced by Harpy Tuminello,
L. A., ’68, who concluded, “I
don’t think it net any of the
organizations anything.”

Ronald Cowell, L. A., ’68, rep-
resented the majority viewpoint
of freshmen when he remarked,
“I think it’s great. It’s‘a good op-
portunity for freshmen to be-
come acquainted with the vari-
ous campus activities.

Dido Fills Vacancy

IFC Rejects Resolution
For Homecoming Floats

The Interfraternity Council (IFC) voted down a reso.
lution urging fraternities to build floats for Homecoming.
At the meeting Wednesday night, held in the Student Union,
the resolution was defeated’ by a 9-12 vote.

Chairman of the Homecoming
Committee Jimmy Meyerson of
Sigma Alpha Mu urged the rep-.
resentatives to vote for the reso-
lution. Meyerson explained that
the ﬂoats, which would be paraded
in the stadium before the game,
would add color and pageantry
to the weekend. He also empha-
sized that the fraternities would
be looked upon as vital source of
school spirit at the University.

Those representatives who op-

posed the motion claimed that.

float building in past years had
been too time-consuming. Other
objetions included the money in-
volved in building and the lack
of space in which to construct
them. This will be the second
homecoming in a row that there
have been no ﬂoats.

The resolution, only urged the
fraternities to build ﬂoats and it
did not state that lfraternities who
wish cannot builti ﬂoats. Last
year the resolution stated that if
a majority of fraternities did not
agree to build ﬂoats, none would.
Last year decorated bill boards
replaced ﬂoats.

At the same meeting Robert
Dido of Sigma Chi was elected
ﬁfth man on the executive com-
mittee of IFC. Mike Johns re-
signed --the position at the same
meeting.

Dido is a sophomore in liberal
arts, taking a pre-dental course
of studies.'He was historian and
IFC-- representative of his chap-

trophy and was’ also cited as’

   Editorial: llnfair Orientation
 . The poor turnout at the Activities Fair Wednesday and Thursday reflects a basic
aw_ in the University’s concept of orienting freshmen.
The Fair is primarily designed to orient freshmen and any other students to the
iiportunities presented by different student organizations. This purpose is admirable,
tthe fourth week of September is not the time,
 , Students should be oriented during Freshman orientation. They should be exposed

’ The University’s current policy does not permit such an endeavor. The feeling is

 pread the coverage out over

result of this
lack of unity.

position in the basic controversy
Twithogut making an explicit state-
ment on. its news pages of the
‘different positions involved.

ernment without a president dis-

fund was to be allocated by the

Student Affairs Committee and
members of the administration.

>April 1: Student Govern-
ment passed the Ruskay-Bern-
stein bill which would allow SG
to choose a committee of ﬁve un-
oiergraduate students to- allocate
the fund. '

> April 9: A compromise com-
mittee, composed of two. repre-
sentatives each from SA and SG,
the ﬁnancial adviser to student

activities, and the Vice-Chancel-

lor of Student Affairs (with
whom ﬁnal authority rested),
were accepted by all parties con-
cerned to allocate the fund. -

SG President Eric Stern sub-
mitted a letter to Dr. Alan C.
Rankin (then Vice-Chancellor of
Student and General Affairs) an-A
nouncing the veto‘ of the SG bill
of April 1, and SG approval of
the compromise measure. It was
later alleged that Stern was
“pressured” into accepting the
compromise measure under the
threat of losing the activities fee
altogether. Stern has not issued
.a formal statement on this mat-
ter.

> September 9: SG passed the
“2-2 arrangement” with the un-
derstanding that they would rati-
fy the SA nominees to the‘ com-
mittee. »

>September 16: SG reversed
its position of Sept. 9 and unani-
mously adopted the Ruskay-Bern-
stein ‘bill ofvApril 1, calling for
SG to appoint» a ﬁve man alloca-

dergraduate students.

SG was influenced in its deci-

sion by a speech made by Sena-
tor Rick Schweder
Schweder drew upon a conversa-
tion he had with Helen Pool
Rush, vice-chancellor of student
affairs during the preceding wsek.

Miss Rush, he said, believed that,"

in principal, SG should‘ be_ an

Staternent of Editorial Policy   he

IT HAS become obvious during the past week that we must‘ clari-
fy the editorial policy of this newspaper. Editorials are the opinion
of the paper, not the opinion of any one member of the editorial board.

EDITORIALS reflect the paper’s opinion on signiﬁcant news
issues. Individual members of the editorial board express their opin-
ions in editorial columns. There is no stigma placed on any member
of the paper to agree fully with the opinions expressed by any other

members of the paper.

THE PAPER is a forum to present factual accounts of all sides
of newszissues. In doing so, we strive for objectivity.

SINCE THIS goal may not always be achieved, we request that
any misrepresentations or omissions of facts be corrected. Our Letters
to the Editor section provides space for this and for the expression

of views of the readership.

tion of the activities fee by the
Board of:.__Tri.istees.

Vice-Chancellor Rush declared

in

the.SG bill of Sept. 16 unaccept- '

able, under authority grantedto
the vice-chancellor of student af-
fairs by the Board of Trustees.
This action was seemingly con-
tradictory to the tone of the con-
versation between Vice-Chancel-
lor Rush and Senator Schweder
held prior to the passage of the
SG bill of Sept. 16. It was alleged
that there were some misunder-
standings or misinterpretations

‘ of what was said in the conver-

sation:

> September 23: Senator John
Ruskay, Pitt Progressive Party
chairman, submitt a proposal
calling for a student‘ referendum
on the matter of activities fee
allocation. The referendum was
defeated by a 15 to *9 vote, with
all nine “for” votes coming from
the PPP.

Martin Engels, Able Party chair-
man, in voting down the referen-
dum, felt that the immediate
need of student organizations

for funds was the paramount con-'

cern.

Supporters of the referendum
motion reasoned that, if support-
ed by a majority of the student
body, the referendum would
place the majority will of the
student body in direct‘ conﬁict
with the decision of the. Vice-
Chancellor who was rightfully

THE CHAIN of events depicts
the increase in scope of the issue
involved —— from the technical
matter of allocating the activities
fee to the broader issue of stu-
dent-administration power rela-
tionships. W _ .

One group of. student leaders
rnaintainsthe position that’ Sen-
ator Jim ‘Smith voiced in his re-

‘ cent resignation speech. Students,

.This position holds that stu-
dents may question administra-
tive .polic"y '['within.. the ‘existing
legal framework. Whenthe means
of questioning are exhaused
without effecting change, policies
that are challenged .must be
‘ abided -by. System, maintenance

. becomes the overriding concern.

ANOTHER ‘group of student
leaders views student-administra-
tion power relations in an oppo-
site manner. This position can
be associated with the views of

, Senators Ruskay and Schweder.

, They feel that the existing frame-
work is viable, but‘ that strict
adherence to the framework in-
hibits _ ‘change. Student Govern-
ment, they feel," should repre-
‘sent the students, not act ‘as “a
rubber stamp for the administra-
tion.”,

» They agree that all means with-
in the existing system should be‘
utilized when attempting to effect
change. Schweder continues, that.
when all means of questioning
student - administration relation-
ships are exhaused, it is neces-
sary to go outside the system to
effect change but then only with
the support of a ‘majority of the
student body. A B -

Ruskay asserts that extra-legal
means would not become neces-
sary, for the administration when
faced with the will of the student
majority would recognize many
of the student ‘demands, He feels
that many’ of the Senators who
voted against a referendum in the
allocation issue did not want thfs
power relationship issue to come
to a head, for according to the
formal’ framework these Sena-
tors saw the SG position blocked.
This legal approach, according to
Ruskay position, does\not take
the human factor into considera-
tion. , I ,

has failed to act responsibly.”
The Pitt News believes that SG A
would best represent the stu-
dents’ interests by seeting to the_
actual allocation of the _activities
fee, rather than “b_ickering’.’ over ‘
the method of allocation. . - 

What The Pitt News has ‘not
done is deﬁne’ explicity on its
news ‘ pages the concept of re-
sponsible action as conceived by
each faction. B_oth_ positions are
tenable. .

THE PITI‘ NEWS, in my opin-
ion, also has a responsibility in
this controversy.‘ It is the. only
newspaper on campus". While it
has the right to take a strong
position on an issue and to choose
its manner of news reporting
(.“straight” or “interprettai_ve'”),
it also has an obligation to seek '
out explicit statements on both
sides of an issue. A case in point
was the large space devoted to
the Smith resignation. _

This term The Pitt News has
welcomed opposing positions on
issues from anyone who cared to =
come to The Pitt News and pre-. ,
sent them. In a town that has’.
two newspapers supporting dif-_
ferent _ editorial positions this‘
might suffice. 9n the Pitt cam-
pus, "this is not enough. The Pitt
News must ‘fulﬁll its obligation
in “a one paper town"" to ex-
plicitly present both positions of
an issue.

The News has
comment several times after SG
meetings, and he has not re-
mained to comment. Stern was
also asked to be quoted on se-
veral allegations against Miss
Rush. He has yet to reply.

This is not a blanket indicment
of all news reporting this term.
It does particularly apply to the
issue of Sept. 27. The Pitt News

‘can, and should, adopt an edi-

torial position on isues, to en-
lighten, provoke and evaluate. At
the same time it'must deﬁne its
news style so that ‘it gives the
balanced coverage which is neces-

munity.

In the last week, or more ac-
curately, since last April there
has been much discussion and
debate concerning control over
allocations of .certain money,
that was officially invoiced as
student activities fees. More re-
cently (Sept. 27), this paper
pressed practically an entire edi-
'tion devoted to, just this discus-
sion and debate, speciﬁcally its
report of, and editorials asso-
ciated with Student Government
(SG) activities ‘dealings with -this
topic. A restatement of even the
essence of this edition would _be
ludicrous on my part; therefore,
I will conﬁne myself to reference
in this area when it is called for.

clearer picture of insecurity and
adolescence, I am sure was nev-
er before witnessed on this cam-
pus. ' ' ‘
A distant voice screams, “Why?”
Because, dearhearts, when men
are pitted against each other in
emotional discordance, they can-
not hear the voice of reason.
There were two factions at
that meeting: those who wished
to bow to‘ the dictates of an all

. those who shouted, “Maturity
Now!” and in shouting, defeated
their own position. The basic
question of this SG meeting, as
The Pitt News intimated, was not
whether the SG should control
the allocation of its new funds,
but whether the SG could live up
to its name within the conﬁnes
set up for it by an administra-
tion that obviously lacks faith in
the ability of the student‘ body
to administrate its own affairs.

What use is a Student Govern-
ment that does not- do what its
title implies? If the last meeting
of that organization wasany sam-
ple of its ability to do so, then

“since the day of its opening,
has slowly descended into ,. a
' udy enigma of cancelled class-
es, indignant professors, and in-
ensed students.'It could all have
een avoided.

'_ "The building was originally
iplanned by Helen Clay Frick and
the administration as a Fine Arts
_,Center for both the University
and the city—a Fine Arts Cen-
,ter——not a classroom building,

fet"C'athedral, as many students
and faculty members believed. It
Qwas meant to provide instruction
_areas for the ﬁne arts so it con-
tains classrooms, workshops, and
ne large 200-seat lecture hall. It
V‘v"as'.meant to house literature on
the ﬁne arts so it has a library
devoted exclusively to them, and

art so the building is part mu-
Eeum. ,

:_It was not meant as a general
class building, and no one, until
approximately June 1, intended
the’ building to be used, except
occasionally, by any other de-
?partment of the University. It
was envisioned that any portion
of the building that was not to

"ty ,ﬁne arts program would be
used by the public.

In the beginning of June, Rich-
ard O. Hodges, director of Stu-
_dent Records, and Dr. Charles H.
Peake, vice -chancellor of the
-Academic Disciplines, were afraid
that the University's existing fa-
cilities would not be able to ac-
commodate all of the classes then
planned. They searched for other
classroom facilities and eventual-
ly.. decided to use the Fine Arts
Building.

5 However, it became evident by
the /first week -of the trimester
that the * space in the Building
_would_' not be needed, and Hodges
began to move the classes back
to their usual locations. A few
. were moved to the Carnegie Lec-
ture Hall to free the Frick hall
for the public’s use in the after-
noon.‘ "_

.. The public is taking advantage
pf this opportunity, according to
Walter R. I-Iovey, Frick ﬁne arts
professor and director of the
Building. Many organizations
have contacted his office and
asked for space.

' It is. evident that most of the
resentment on campus over the
classroom limitations put upon
the building was based on the in-

apparent, however, that the stu-

and inexperienced country girl
who is desperately looking for

Thus follows a hilarious scene
which shows the three wheeling
this magniﬁcent bed through the
heart of downtown London. Nan-
cy plops' herself down on the
rusty springs, sans, matress, as

Colin and his friend push behind.”
For a brief rest, they park their.

vehicle next to a meter, where
they partake of a. meal replete
with wine, sitting on the bed.

Upon her ﬁrst confrontation
with Tolen, Nancy, this ingenue,
ﬁnds herself hoplessly frightened
by this sophisticated city-bred Don

Juan. Colin thinks this might be

an opportune time for him ’to
learn the knack. But even while

he discusses the subject with his.

mentor, Nancy becomes enrap-
tured with Tolen. His natural in-
stincts for seduction have taken

. OVGI‘.

Following is a chase that would
put all the Keystone Cops to

shame.‘ Tolen and Nancy hop on

an comedy 

his motorcycle which isequipped
with as many extras as James’
Bond’s Austin-Martin in Gold-
ﬁnger. Colin, hoping to prevent
the obvious runs after them by
foot. Their pursuer keeps up
with the motorcycle for ‘the
length of the chase, but eventual-
ly looses them in the woods.
It’s nearly impossible to ﬁnd
anything wrong with this Cannes
Film "Festival winner. Even the
use of slapstick is so sophisti-
cated that it never becomes ham-
handed. Director of ‘Photography
David Watkins handles difficult
scenes like the chase with great
ability. John Barry's musical
scores blend perfectly’ with the

‘scene they accompany. His adapt-

ations of classicnickeldeon chase
themes compliment perfectly the
movement of the stars. , . .

Director Richard ‘Lester ‘might
not have Tolen’s type of knack,
but he certainly has .a special <
ability to move his actors like
pawns in a well-played game of
chess. The expert timing in -the .
chase scene exemplifes his obvi-
ous skill. -

I By ROBERT TUTT
I “I feel like I'm on.The Man
= from Uncle” w.as one student's
lremark while walking through
 the halls of the Westinghouse Re-
search and Development 'Center.,
1-This student was one of a group
, , graduate library students from
the University who were visiting
 the Westinghouse research li-
brary as part of a tour of local
libraries of signiﬁcance. The re-
EV search library at Westinghouse
‘ is the one which best typiﬁes, in.
the opinion of the libraryschool
‘faculty, the “special library.” ."

 ness of vital secrets reminded
/one student of the UNCLE head-
T quarters 'kn‘own " to -television
 viewers. The ultra top secret at-
: mosphere was enhanced by the
 presence of a-guard at the gates
,,to the center.

{A vided this tour as a part of the

total "training program for future
plibrarians This tour of local li-
I braries has given the student an
_. inside view of the three main
.1 types of libraries. First, they
were shown the inner workings
of the Carnegie Library of Pitts-
gburgh. They saw such depart-
 ments as "the cataloguing depart-
,ment, the acquisitions depart-

rarely glimpsed by the public.
Then they saw the most up-to-

date high school library in this’

area. The North Hills High School
library is the dream of every
school librarian. Every type ‘of
modern library convenience is
provided for both librarians and
pupils. This is an experimental
library in which the value of sev-

eral innovations are being _ put '

to the test. _

Among the new devices being
tried are self-service movie pro-
jectors, tape recorders, tape re-
cording collections and listening
rooms. "There is a" room setaside
where a teacher can hold classes

in the library while conducting a_ -

library project. This also fea-
tures a. soundproof booth where_ a
student can practice speeches,

use the foreign language practice .

The climax ‘of this series_ of
tours ‘was provided by the West_- _
inghouse research library. [In a,
newand completely modern

building, nearly 55,000 volumes ‘

are housed for the use "of the‘
scientists and engineers [of the_

Westinghouse research and de-.

velopment department. Along
with these books , and ‘periodicals __.

- are.‘ housed extensive ﬁles of top

ments and a vault of books and

The library school faculty be-
lives that the best way» to learn.

' about libraries is to see them in

action. It is for this reason that

C they have arranged for their stu-

dents to see the very best.

   

Center Built

The World University Ser-
vice (WUS), an internation-
al student -.to - student self-
help organization, sponsored
a program to build a Uni-
versity of Korea student
center.

Students from Hong Kong,
Japan, ‘South Vietnam, the
United States, Korea, and Britain
participated and paid their own
way‘ with money they solicited
from organizations, such as Ki-
wanis, and from private donors.

_The Korean student center
owns a, $100,000 complex and
« consists of .a dormitory, canteen,
barbershop, library, book store,
health clinic, and a ' recreation
"center. The center's -cost is co-
operative, whichemeans that $50,-

«000Sis furnished by the students -

' and faculty of_the University of
Korea, who buy stock in the cen-
ter. The. other $50,000 is contri-
buted by WUS. .

‘Both. the building and’ fund

' plans were initiated by the Kore-

ans themselves, another example

MDC Takes Action
  On Dorm Social Rules

The proposal to establish a committee to study social
rules changes in the men's dormitories was unanimously
passed at the Wednesday meeting of Men’s Dorm Counci.

(lVIDC).

Commenting on the passage of this bill, Harvey Lefton,
president of MDC, stated, “This is something that falls di-

rectly within the sphere of Men’s
Dorm Council. I think we’ve
sensed the need in this area just
from the reactions of the mem-
bers of Dorm Council, and it is

. our hope that we can come up

with a proposal that will reﬂect
the feelings of the men in the
Towers. I was happy to see this
action_on .the part of the Dorm
Council and look forward to such
liberal legislation in the future.”

Members of the Social Rules
Changes Committee include Ron
Bonomo, Chuck Levine, Warren
Coax, Marty Loftus, Jack Haight,
Joe Seton, and Bernard Holzman.

The MDC also passed a bill
concerning‘the occupation of the
game room. The dry cleaning
service will be moved to the
game room, thereby enlarging its
facilities for operation. The equip-

ment now in the gameroom will '

be moved to other locations.

The third bill on the agenda -

dealttwith the rules for increas-
ing dormitory security. The MDC

voted to send a letter to Vice-'

chancellor of Student Affairs Hel-
en P. Rush asking that the dormi-
tories have more police protec-
tion.‘

Lefton’s reaction to MDC’s‘ﬁrst
meeting of the school year w.as a
favorable one, as he commented
on the encouraging signs that

were evident Wednesday. He as‘-I

serted that “real efforts have
been made to effect changes such
as the recent revisions in policy
that appeared in The Pitt News
last week.” V

The new social rules include

the following provisions:_grad- --

u.ate women and senior assis-
tants may be permitted to serve

as chaperones for house partie§; A

one couple may be permitted in
a room during open houses and
house parties; and those men en-
tertaining guests in the rooms
must have their doors comple e-
ly open. Immediate disciplinary
action will be taken against the
student involved if any infraction
is reported. , ‘

Panthers Invade W. Virginia omorrow

 Being Frank

by FRANK SMIZIK
Sports Editor

  

“IT’S EVEN GREATER WINNING DOWN THERE”

The Hatfields and the McCoys will come down from the
mountains on Saturday to continue their 70 year feud. They
will not be feuding among themselves, however, for the city
fellows from Pittsburgh will cross the Mason-Dixon Line
to play football. .

The heart of the poverty belt of Appalchia will be the
scene of the game but from all reports a wealth of talent
will be on the field. Garrett Ford and Dick Leftridge have
gotten great press and have been pushed to be the new Mr.
Outside and Mr. Inside. _

Allen McCune has had a phenomenal year so far with
his passing. His quarterbacking and _ roll out maneuvers
have led the Mountaineers’ attack, which has accumulated
90 points. _

All of these statistics that have -been quoted have im-
pressed everyone but the Panthers. Captain Phil Dahar who
has helped instill this quiet conﬁdence in the gridders insists
that West Virginia hasn’t proved anything to him because
they haven’t played anyone. _ _

“We’re not too impressed with the statistics because
they have played poor teams. Leftridge may have a lot of
potential but he hasn’t ever shown it against us; Garrett
Ford may be great but I think we can hold him,

Dahar may have to bring a lasso with him to stop the
the running attack of the Mounties, but if he helps stop
Ford, Leftridge and McCune like he helped stop Pannel,
Hart, and Hammond last week he won't need one. For his
great defensive play he received the game ball from his
teammates. .

The defense for West Virginia will also have to contain
a couple of explosive Panther backs. Barry McKnight

closer to full strength now that he has the stitches out of
his hand. _

McKnight has been hampered not only by_his hand but
by lack of openings for him to run through in the not so
pushy offensive line. Last week McKnight seemed like he
was running hard but was slowed down before he could get

t t d.
S ar The other threat the Mountaineers have to curtail is
Eric Crabtree. Crabtree has come into his _own this year
especially as a pass catcher. His grabs agalnst Oklahoma
broke the back of the Sooner defense. _

An interesting sidelight on Crabtree’s _pass catching
will be his ability to elude rugged_ Mountaineer defender
Richie Martha. “A lot of times  will be running patterns
on his side and I expect to. be hit pretty good. _Martha is
very aggressive and -we hope we can work on him and get
the long pass off of him.”. _ _ _

Crabtree is also being compared to West Virginia speed-
ster Ford. “I don't know whether I like being compared to
him or not,” said Crabtree. He is only a sophomore and I'm
a senior. On the other hand they say he is a potential All-
American so that sort of makes me feel better when they
compare us.” _ _

With the quiet conﬁdence of Dahar and the explosive
threats of McKnight and Crabtree the Mountaineers had
better be ready for a Panther team that will be up as high
as they are for the game. All three are seniors and want to
win the last game in Morgantown. As Crabtree said I don 
mind playing in Morgantown, because it 1S even greatei
beating them down there

ALLEN McCUNE (left) and Kenny Lucas (right)
will be directing the passing attacks tomorrow.

Lucas was selected as last week’s quarterback

Mountaineer Backfield Challenges
Improved Gridder Defensive Unit 1

Coach Steve Petro scouted
West Virginia for two games
as though the Panthers were
playing in the Rose Bowl
and not Mountaineer Field

this Saturday. \ .
Freshman coach Steve Petr
witnessed West Virginia roll up
90 points in two games, allowing
Richmond and William and Mary
only 14. Considering the quality
of the Mountaineer’s. opponents,
Petro was still quite impressed.

What impressed Petro the most
was quarterback Allen McCune,
fullback Dick Leftridge and soph-
omore tailback Garrett Ford.
These three have combined to
make the Mountaineer’s two point
favorites Saturday.

McCune completed 15 of 18
passes last week. “McCune is that
type of quarterback that goes out
there to complete 100 percent of
his passes not just 50 per cent,”
said West Virginia publicity- di-
rector Edgar Barnett.

Petro describes McCune as be-
ing “very impressive with his
arm. He can complete them long
or short and he can stop in mid-
motion and still throw the ball
with accuracy. His speed also
gives them an extra running
threat. With a quarterback like
that they’re on their way to be-
ing a fine football team.”

Petro must have seen some-
thing in McCune’s running abil-
ity which Richmond and William
and Mary didn’t. Iii three at-
tempts rushing, McCune. gained
one yard.

McCime has attempted 27 pass-
es. Balancing his attack in full-
back Dick Leftridge, who has
carried the ball 27 times for 180
yards. Leftridge is also a good
pass-blocker and has been cred-
ited with giving McCune most of
his passing time.

The most talked about (person
in the .Moun"taineer backﬁeld is
tailback Garrett Ford. The 6-foot-
3, 210 pound sophomore has
gained 226 yards in 20 carries
for an 11.3 average. Sam Huff,
.al1-Pro linebacker and former
all-American has called Ford “the
best looking back I’ve seen in a
long while. He should be West
Virginia’s next all-America.”

Ford has also caught three '

passes for 78 yards. This type of
speed will present quite a break-
away threat to the Panthers.

What the statistics don't show
is that Ford’s 226 yards contain
two 67 yard runs against teams
not noted for their quality foot-
ball. Also in last. year’s fresh-
man game, the ‘Cubs beat the
little Mountaineer’s 7-6. Ford
wasn_’t impressive then.

“All the coaches have been
telling us that Ford is really
tough,” said sophomore fullback
Joe. Jones. “I remember tackling
him ﬁve or six times in last
year's freshman game and he
wasn’t that tough to bring down.”

Coach John Michelosen feels
that West Virginia could be the
toughest squad he'll face all year.

 

of the East. McCune completed 15 of 18 passes
against William and .Mary in a 34-14 route.

Being an underdog didn’t bother
him at all. “What difference does
it make. We grew up defensively
in .a lot of ways last week. Mi-
trakos picked up his play and
wasn’t frustrated nearly as often
as in the opener.

“The only thing that disap-
pointed me was the running
game. We were using Crabtree
more as a pass receiver, but it
didn’t materialize quite the way
we wanted to see-it.”

A punting duel could material-"V
ize tomorrow between Panther
Andy McGraw and Mountaineer
Chuck Kinder. Last week Mc-
Graw averaged 44.6 yards a boot
and Kinder averaged 46.4 yards.
Petro calls Kinder, “the best asset
they have on their team.”

The Phi Eps broke a pitchers

Up to that point, pitcher Dick

Grove City College, the team that put the soccer team
on the skids last year, challenges the booters tomorrow at
Schenley Oval at 1 :30 p.m. If it rains before tomorrow, the
game will be re-scheduled for Kennard Field.

Last season coach Leo Bemis’s soccer team rolled along,
carrying a 4-1 record until they met up with the unbeaten

Grovers who thrashed them 6-3.
After that, the booters were nev-
er the same. Bemis’ squad ﬁn-
ished the season at 5-5.

The Grovers always ﬁeld a
tough soccer team, compiling a
life-time record of 111 wins, 54
losses, and 19 ties. Nine straight
wins last season clima-xed by a
12-0 trouncing of Western Re-
serve, 'an all-time Grove City
scoring record, gave coach Cliff
Wettig the fourth undefeate.d
team in Grover history.

“We had a tremendous season
last year, but I would not expect
us to do it again,” said coach
Wettig. \“There is a certain
amount of luck connected with
an undefeated season and every-
thing must go right for you be-
sides holding injuries to a mini-
mum.”

With 15 lettermen and a veter-
an stationed at every position,
Coach Wettig may not need luck
this year.

“They’re a solid bua-ll club,” said
coach Bemis. “They have ﬁne
speed and good size, but the fel-

PHI EP’S Ed Cole tagged‘ out in rundown by Sammy’s shortstop
Jim Myerson after his double scored two runs. ‘

Phi E1) Stays Unbeaten;
Wins Showdown Battle

Third baseman Rick Rogow and
shortstop Bill. Sivitz were parti-
cularily outstanding.

The lone Sammy run came on
Jerry Meyerson’s base hit with
runners .at the corners. Smokler,
who went the distance in a los-
ing cause now has a record of
two wins and one loss. ,

On the other field, Pi Lam was
winning a close game from Del-
ta Sig, 12-11. Elliot Brumberger’s
two-run blast in the first helped
the Lam’s off to a quick 3-0 lead
which they held on to through-
out the contest.

Southpaw pitcher Harvey Kop-
elowitz made his IF debut for the
Pi Lam’s .and got the victory. He
was supported not only by Brum-
berger’s homerun, but shortstop
Bruce Martin and Roger Levine
alsohsocked homeruns.

Delta Sig, who was paced by
the hitting of Bill Gallela, almost
saved the game in the seventh.
The tying run was on second
with two out, but Roth McNally
bounced harmlessly to the mound
to end the threat.

\~\

lows are looking forward to play-
ing them. They want to avenge
last year’s loss.”

Scott Gay, a sophomore center
forward, leads the high scoring
Grovers who Last season kicked
49 goals in nine games for a 5.4
average while holding all oppon-
ents to a total of seven goals.
Gay won the individual scoring
honors, booting ten goals.

Accompanying Gay on the for-
ward line are co-captain and left-
winger Bob Bishop and sopho-
more right-winger Pete Anselmo.
Playing between the wings and
the center are left-inside Chai
Vathanakul and sophomore right-
inside John Pontier.

One of the main reasons Grove
City allowed only seven goals
all of last year was goalie Dick
Manley, a two-year letterman. As
a sophomore. he A won a spot on
the All-Pennsylvania-New Jersey-
Delaware team.

In last year's game against the
soccermen, Grove City utilized a
gang defense and a fast break

to win. A gang defense is good
on a small ﬁeld like Grove City’s,
but Schenley Oval and Kennard
Field are just a little less than
the NCAA regulations allow. The
fast break is another thing, how-
ever.

Against West Chester State, the
soccer team saw a fast break, and
lost.

In that defeat, the booters play-
ed even ball with. the Rams un-
til left.winger Al Traunsteiner in-
jured his knee, and then every
thing was disorganized. Traun-
steiner won't be playing against
Grove City.

Bemis has not decided who
will start at the left-wing posi-
tion. In the West Chester game,
he looked .at two sophomores at
this position, Pete Snyder, Bill
Zurzola, and also senior Dave
Shaffer.

Since Bemis - coached teams
work their wings a lot on of-
fense, these three must come
through. .

Bemis is also concerned about
his forward line. We must have
and forward line. We must have
solidity from the ha-lfbacks
through to the fullbacks.”

The job of the starting half-
backs, Vince Bartolotta, left-half;
Ferd Sauer, center-half; and Jim
Snyder, right-half, is to mediate
between offense and defense.
