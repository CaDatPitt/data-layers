Much of the attention of men who strive to attain progress for
 Pitt‘ is centered upon the improvement of ‘activities. » Leaders.'heI_reA
 ku"‘owA that the outside world, too often a destructively critic-al.worldA,'

Pittsburgh from the impression furnished, by activities? of the insti-

Older Pitt men know that the time has come to-speak ‘boldly
about matters which menace the growth of every branch of activity
life. AWhat might be called the “younger generation” of students,
has in many cases assumed the wrong attitude toward acAt-ivities.‘ ’ To
tell an ugly story in‘ the fewest possible fwords: too. many persons
have" entered activities in recent years, with a_des‘ir_e Ato. adarance their

P asked directly or implied by conduct, of ‘those who enter activities
, today. “How soon will I be pro,m’0ted’ZA’s’~is the ’queryI ‘coming from
too great'.anumber,~of participants in studentaifairs.

The feeling of wanting something for nothing; of .secI'uring'ad-A

of the glory of Pitt, must be checked before it spreads. Such a. false

pioneers who sacriﬁced ..all-Ahope of f:per‘so-nal advancementfor the
good of thewhole; of ‘men who ﬁlled humble’ niches --here during four

be workers in student enterprises for the sole purpose of ‘gaining.,the.

Only by hard work upon the part of members can activities gain
recognition for Pitt. ‘ Pitt supporters do notwant the future activity
system to be top-heavy, to stand in the form of anvinverted pyramid,
with “all hands” scrambling for positions at the top, and none will-

Friday night, eve of the ’\‘V..,& 1.
game, the biggest demonstration ever
given a PittAfootbalAl team ,was pa.r-I
ticipatedrin by over 1,000 supporters
of theA Blue and Gold. It took ‘the

ﬁre, and red ﬁre parade through the
downtown district. A~ large majority
-of those who attended. the bonﬁre’
went along in the parade, which pro-
ceeded with increasing‘ enthusiasm
through Oakland, along two and one-
half miles of Fifth avenue, and through,
the very heart of the downtown soc-A
tion, visiting the Fort Pitt Hotel, _W.
& J. stronghold,’ and winding up in
a noisy ﬁnale, at the ,Wi1liam Penn
Hotel. ._ ' . A . , ‘ ‘.
The sight of hundreds of Pitt ‘boys
swinging along arm in arm, yell-ingAA
and chanting ominous things about
VV. & J., and yelling for their team,
stirred up many, a Pittsburgh night
walker,‘ The celebration. made its
mark in that it was one of the peppi-
est of any grid celebration "held here-
abouts. The long line of victory-
tl11‘illed,,Pittites made numerous’ stops
on the Fifth avenue route.’ IStreet“
cars, motor vehicles and the occu
pants thereof, iwere troubled time
after time with mischievous pranks
played by the overjoyed marchers.
The "bonﬁre, itself, was an inspir-
ing sight, Davies, Edgar and Ewing
were hoisted on shoulders and ‘request-
ed to speak. On the downtown streets
the parade spied Captain Stein _walk~-
ing with a. _co-edIVfrom somewhere,
whereupon said captain made a com-
pulsory speecli"while = supported in
mid-air by fellow students.‘ Infront

A straight over W. & J. My, it must be
- - ‘ hardwfor those fellows. With the best»
‘ V material for years, they hoped to skin I
the Panther, but found Pitt had a bet-
ter material a_.nd a. better team. The
Panther always goes them, one betteg.
This time W. & J. was fortunate in
sustaining only a. 7-0 defeat. V
The whole" team played ‘splendid
ball but, ‘as usual, there_,were'some
whoiplayed beﬁer than others. Tommy
Davies got another stranglehold on
an All-American position. It’s going
to be pretty hard to keep Tommy off
that team of stars. ‘McCracken was
there “with tlie goods” when he was
‘ called upon. When a fewyards were
needed, “old reliable Herb" got the
ball: Capt. ‘.‘Herbie” Stein washere.
there and everywhere.
found. that little was to be gained
through him.“ He was just showing
' Mr. Crooks how. the center position-
should be played. Besides playing a.
wonderﬁul defensive game at center,
he made numerous stops at theends
of, the line and intercepted a forward
‘pass as well. He is another "of our
All‘-American candidates. Holleran ran
the,team in “tip-top fashion,” as well
as advancing the ‘ball very. cleverly.
Anderson dmade his presence keenly
felt. ' The W. & J. forwardsowere well
satisﬁed when he retired. The whole
line performed well. -They openeil
- large holes to allow their backs to
slide through for big gains.

For W. &J.-, Erickson was the out-
standing star. From a kick formation.
he /‘pulled off” large gains and con-
tinually kept the Panther on its toes.

3His pal, Eielson4 was also a shining .

light. McLaughlin was‘ -always dan-
gerous with his long "‘heaves.’f The
star ends, Carrol and Loucks, were
very much in evidence. “Rus” Stein
attempted to equal‘ his brother, our.
“Henbie” and was a tower of strength
in the-W. & J. rush line. ' “ .
-The score does not show ‘the real
superiority of the. Panthers. ’,W. & .J.
barely escaped with only one touch-
down scored jagainst‘ them. Three
'.would have looked better. In theﬁrst
part of . the ﬁrst quarter, W. & J.-

threatened‘ our goal, but it was ronly a

threat, ‘and that was their
last chance to score. ' - _
In the third quar_ter,VPitt was-within

‘ 2 inches of the goal, but was prevent-
ed’ from scoring by a_ fumble, and
Erickson immediately kicked out of
danger. It was in this advance that
W. &; J. was completely fooled by a
trick. ‘Score another for “Pop” War-
ner. ,With the ball on the .25-yard line,

first ‘ and

_'3

‘for a goal from placement, but instead
McCracken got_ the ball and plunged

0. joff tackle for 8 yards. It was a com-
plete surprise. The W. & -J. stands

V pleaded"‘Block that kick.” The W. &
.J. ‘team bunchiedfat the center and
was totally unpreparekyfbr a plunge.
Again in the fourth quarter, .Pitt
threatened seriously. The Panther
worked the ball up tothe 9-yard line,

only to have a. forward pass inter-
cepted.
The ‘game was the cleanest seen

. , here this season and this fact was
favorably commented ‘upon by the
- critics. There were only two«substi-
tutes beca-usegof injuries. There was
only ‘a total of 62 yards in penalties
 and only one 15-yard penalty for each
side. Quite remarkable. S V
Ideal‘ football weather prevailed.
The weather was _cold enough to put
“snap” into the plays, but not too cold
From the spec-
» .tators’ viewpoint, it‘ma.y have been a
little cold in waiting’ for the game
time, but immediately after the ﬁrst
Whistle blew, it was warm enough.
.The largest crowd in Pitt"s football,
history wason hand ‘to give the teams
a “lift.” At 1 o’clock, thestudent sec-
tions were ﬁlled and even at 124230 the
,;general admi’ss?ion“stands were packed.
. 0 ;.At game: time every nook and corner
. . min the .Belleﬁeld lot was occupied and
-,-still there were thousands to be ac-
.-commodated. ., v ,
‘There was great spirit. and rivalry
"in "this greatthrong. The intense ri-
valry.was shared by player, students,
. alumni and followers. Butsv-trjict-order
, was in: force. All remembered they
*were ladies and gentlemen. 7_That is
the true college spirit. " ’

, contest of, its 1920.

Day, in the closing

Although somewhaft
due» to, their victvoryg last _, year and 1 to
I their “impressive-work?-this season, the

o

glzions will ﬁnd no easy.‘ time with their

Panther foe when they inyade the

local territory _ "to thresh out the East-

ern football championship question.
Never ‘before has this game com-

to ‘get this year. Practically the en‘-
tire_Eastern district is looking ‘for-
-ward to the contest that is once for
all going to deﬁnitely, decidethe su-
'premacy of the East. Neither team
has thus far this season" lost a. game
and both elevens have played a. tie.
_-apiece. . _' ‘ _
‘The fact that State was forcedto

‘ play a deadlock withbLehigh:on Sat-
urday is more conclusive proof that;

the Mt’. Nittany'Lions are holding out
every ounce of their reserve strength
for the battle with~~‘Pitt_. However,
,Warner is also looking forward to this
contest, as ‘he well realizes the im-
portance of a victory over his Upstate
rivals. I ' “    
‘ , Last season‘ the State eleven admin‘-
istered a 20-0 defeat-to, the Pitt team
after six. years

team enjoyed a win at‘ the expense of
Pitt until last year. ' .

And this year they expect_.to. dupli-
catetheir feat of 191-9.5. There can be
no doubt‘ that‘ State has a wonderful‘
team, and as a result opposition is
going to be -very keen‘. But Pitt" is
‘also to be at the height of its power
on Thanksgiving Day, as they will-
have 10 days in which to recuperate
and condition themselves.

Just what bearing a victory for
either team will havelon the much
muddled Western situation is not
known, but as far as the Eastern. sec-
tion is concerned itis going to be a
game of prime importance. With Penn
