Pittsburgh area Krishnas claim that sect member Thomas Dresher is not ”within the mainstream"of the Krishna faith.

Local devotee says faith gets a bad name

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer T '

On Monday,_ a federal grand jury
announced the beginning of a probe
into allegations of crimes committed
by former and present members of
the Hare Krishna community near
Moundsville, W.Va.

”lt’s an investigatory grand jury 
as much in the Krishna's best interest
as anybody’s. If there's nothing go-
ing on, let's find out,” said William
Kolibash, the U.S. attorney in charge
of the investigation, in an article
printed in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

New Vrindaban, the largest Krishna
compound in North America, has
been the center of repeated con-
troversy in the 18 years since it was
founded.

Those problems have ranged from
child molestation and drug traffick-

ing to the current charge of murder
against one of its former members.

”This kind of thing hasn't hap-
pened just one time, it's happened a
lot,” said Chandra Shekhara Swami,
a practicing member of the Krishna
sect who has been living and work-
ing in Oakland for the last year.
”Usually these things flare up and
then blow over. Nothing ever comes
of it, but people don't remember that.
They are .left with a bad impression
and never go to the trouble to realize
that those impressions are false.”

Thomas Dresher,‘ who Chandra
said was ”not within the mainstream
of the faith,” is charged with the
shooting death of Steven Bryant on
May 22 in Los Angeles. Bryant was
a critic of the present leader of the
New Vrindaban community,
Kiranananda Swami Bhaktipada, as
well as other aspects of the sect’s
practices.

Dresher is also accused of killing
a second Krishna devotee, Charles St.
Denis.

”Bryant was a nobody, a do-
nothing,” said Chandra, who knew
him when they were both in Los
Angeles. ”He had something bad to
say about everything. He came to the
temple about once every blue moon
and didn't follow the basic principles
that all devotees fol|ow.”

Those principles include strict
vegetarianism, abstention from the
use of all intoxicating substances and
refraining from pre—marital sex.

”He used marijuana frequently,
with regularity. When he was ar-
rested in this area, they found drugs

and a gun on him. The guy was a

nut,” said Chandra in a description
of Bryant. -
”There are a lot of misconception
in the press about us and about this
Dresher. I don't appreciate the papers

cal ling him a devotee. He may have

wanted to think of himself that way, H

but I wouldn't call him that.”

A common misconception that
Chandra referred to is that ”people
hear of illegal activities among in-

dividuals who claim to be affiliated

with the church and get the wrong
impression about us.

”Dresher violated the basic beliefs
of the devotees, and the whole faith
gets a bad name as a result.”

The Krishna leaders at New Vrin-
daban recently published a list of
people claiming to be followers of

‘ the Krishna Consciousness but whom

they felt to be undesirable to the
group. Dresher’s name was on that
list.

”The press creates inferences that
these people are following the
Krishna philosophy, although never
really coming out to say it in so many

Greeks
denied
charity
wrestling
program

By Rosanna Rodriguez
For The Pitt News

The Greek Week executive com-

mittee has been denied permission to

use Fitzgerald Field House for a
benefit professional wrestling match
expected to raise $7,000 for the Har-
marville Rehabilitation Center.

The committee who made. the
decision included members of the
Pitt Program Council and the Office
of Student Activities, and Field House
Facility Coordinator Alfrieda Goff.
Goff refused to disclose the names of
the other members on the committee.

According to Goff, the committee
denied the Greeks permission to use
the fieldhouse because promoters are
directly involved, and the money
raised would not benefit the students.

Students directly involved with the
organization of Greek Week dispute
the decision, however. Their argu-
ment is, granted, the money raised
would not benefit the general student
population, but it would benefit the
selected charity, Harmarville
Rehabilitation Center.

Ken Kumer, a member of the Greek
Week executive committee, said,
f’This would be beneficial to the Pitt
campus, to Greek Week and to the
charity selected.”

The committee spent the summer
researching expected problems such
as insurance, protection of the floor
and scheduling of the benefit so as
not to interfere with scheduled
basketball games. According to
Kumer, the proposal stated that the
facility would be fully insured by the
Professional Wrestling Association. In
addition, security inside the field

‘ house would be provided by frater-

nity members. The Greeks would
also~cover the cost of providing
police security outside the field
house.

Last November 14, the Black Ac-
tion Society presented the Minister
Louis Farrakhan at Fitzgerald Field
House. Despite community tension
and threats of violence by extremist
groups, the entire event went off
without incident.

Kumer is aware of that fact and said
he still plans to pursue thewrestling
program. He intends to meet with
Goff at least one last time.

’’I’m still optimistic,” Kumer said.

New organization formed to push fordivestment

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer '

A press conference was held
yesterday to announce the formation
of the Pitt Divestment Coalition, a
new organization to aid Pitt's contin-
uing divestment campaign.

A statement released reported that
109 American colleges and univer-
sities have totally divested from South
Africa, while Pitt still has close to $15
million invested in South African cor-
porations.

Forty organizations have already
committed themselves to the PDC by
endorsing the divestment rally that

scheduled for Oct. 8. Some of these
organizations include the Faculty
Senate, the Black Action Society and
the Student Government Board, as
well as outside organizations such as
Pittsburghers Against Apartheid.
university that has not been for

The coalition has planned a full-
scale campaign to persuade Pitt's
board of trustees to vote to totally
divest at their meeting to be held Oct.
14. Part of the plan will include sell-
ing T-shirts with the organization's

logo. Various campus organizations,

such as the ‘SGB will be collaborating
in the effort by distributing flyers and
holding a panel discussion, the time

. and date of which should be an-

nounced later this week.

Lloyd Bond, a member of PDC,
said, ~”The SGB is the heart of the
students.” He included it among one
of the many campus organizations
that are supporting the movement,
saying that the only group at the

divestment is its governing body.

Chairman of Pitt's Department of
Black Studies Dennis Brutus said he
believes the end of apartheid is near.
He also explained that one of the ma-
jor obstacles defeating the anti-
apartheid movement is a lack of in-
formation.

”Most of the politicians are simply

uninformed and ignorant,” said
Brutus, referring to their understand-
ing of the predicament of the black
South Africans.

The coalition maintains that even
if the board votes for total divestment,
they will remain an organization in
order to continue to educate and in-

form the public about the conditions
of the people of South Africa.

Ellen Dorsey, a member of the
coalition and Students for a Free
South Africa, said that they are uncer-
tain as to how the board will decide.

”The majority of the committee
supports total divestment; whether
the recommendation will reflect that
is unclear," she said.

Spokeswoman for the divestment
coalition Gail Austin said that the
group has not yet discussed the ac-
tions they will take if the trustees vote

negatively. However, she affirmed»

that such a decision would not cause
the disbanding of the coalition.

 

 

Reagan places summit second to Daniloff

WASHINGTON — For the first
time, President Reagan has said plans
for another superpower summit must
take a back seat to the Soviets’ un-
conditional release of American
reporter Nicholas Daniloff.

The Soviets arrested Daniloff and
charged him with spying just days

I after a Soviet physicist working at the

United Nations, Gennady Zakharov,
was arrested forallegedly trying to
sell defense secrets to an undercover
agent. The Soviets said Daniloff
received a sealed envelope contain-
ing top secret military photos, but
Daniloff maintains he was
framed because he thought he was
’receiving some old newspaper
clippings.

Last Friday, both Daniloff and
Zakharov were released into the
custody of their respective am-
bassadors in New York and Moscow,
pending trial.

The move was more in line with
what the Soviets wanted —— equal
treatment of the pair —— and drew
heavy criticism from House
Democrats who said Daniloff should

be released immediately, while

Zakharov should stand trial.

White House sources said the

' Daniloff affair would be at the top of

Cuban refugees
arrive in U.S.

MIAMI — Sixty-nine former Cuban
political prisoners and 40 family
members arrived in the U.S. Monday
and were greeted by throngs of joyful
comrades.

The release of the prisoners by
Cuban leader Fidel Castro is seen as
a big step toward a lessening of ten-
sions between Washington and
Havanna, sources said.

Many of the former prisoners of
Castro's pro-communist regime said
they had been in Cuban jails for more
than 20 years.

About half said they would remain
in Miami to pick up their lives, while
the rest boarded ﬂights for New York,
Los Angeles and numerous other

, cities where relatives await them.

The State Department said it
checked those leaving the plane
thoroughly to make sure there were
only political prisoners on board and
not ”any common criminals.”

Aquino murder
suspects arrested

MANILLA, Philippines — A trial
court Tuesday ordered the arrest of
25 soldiers and one civilian previous-
ly acquitted of wrongdoing in the
murder of former Philippines opposi-
tion leader Benigno Aquino.

The court declared a ”mistrial” in
the previous trial, saying that trial,
under the personal direction of
former Philippines President Ferdi-
nand Marcos, was a ”sham."

Two of the more prominent
Filipino military officials arrested
were the former armed forces chief
and strong Marcos ally, Gen. Fabian
Ver, and retired Maj. Gen. Prospero
Olivas,.who conducted the military
investigation of the Aquino slaying.

His wife, Corazon, returned to the
Philippines after his assassination and
assumed the leadership of the opposi-
tion movement. Last year she toppled
the Marcos regime after Marcos
allegedly rigged an election, and she
is the current president of the
Philippines.

Aquino was gunned down in
August, 1983 while the military
escorted him off a plane that had just
brought him back to the Philippines
after three years of self-imposed ex-
ile in the United States.

Impeachment trial
1st in 50 years

WASHINGTON — The Senate's
first impeachment trial in half a cen-
tury got under way Monday, with
House prosecutors urging the ousting
of convicted felon and federal judge,
Harry Claiborne.

Despite being convicted of federal
tax evasion in 1984, Claiborne has ~
refused to resign his judgeship and
has continued to draw his $78,700-a-
year salary while serving time in a
minimum security prison in
Alabama.

Claiborne has repeatedly contend-

sible for unintentional mistakes on his
tax returns, but critics contend,"lt is
impossible to believe a federal judge
would be so ignorant of the facts and
responsibilities."

On July 23, the House voted 406-0
to impeach Claiborne for committing
”high crimes and misdemeanors" —
failing to report $106,000 in income
on his 1979 and 1980 tax returns.

WASHINGTON — Senate Repub-

Tuesday to have Democratic op-
ponents limit their debate time in

tion's 16th chief justice.

Adventures inf Alaska

It's not easy being a ”slimer”

By Mike Churchill

Sta ff Writer

ollege students, hearing

tales of adventure and

big money in the fishing

industry, have been go
ing to Alaska in increasing
numbers for the past few years.
They go on the basis of tips,
stories and rumors, for it is nearly
impossible to secure a job in the
lower 48. For those who are per-
sistent, the gamble usually pays
off. That is, of course, if there are
fish.

This year there weren’t many.

I started off to Alaska last spring
and returned almost four months
later with a sack full of memories
and -tales, but with no money.

The day after finals ended,'I
bought a month-long bus pass and
toured the United States, arriving
in Seattle on the May 15. The
next morning I flew to Anchorage.

At the Anchorage airport I met
three Mexicans and a Utah
cowboy on their way to Kenai. I
joined up with them, and we 4
started hitching our way. Because
I had no car and little money, I

always had to hitch-hike to get
somewhere. (It's very easy to do

I in Alaska.)

Five rides and six hours later,
we made the I50-mile trip to
Kenai. The landscape along the
way is comprised of tall pines,
snow capped mountains, streams,
waterfalls and massive glaciers.
Caribou, moose, mountain sheep
and bald eagles are also common
sights. In Kenai I quickly became
frustrated because there was no
work. (I arrived two months before
the season really got going.) The
necessities of everyday living,
however, kept me very busy. I
had never camped before, so I
had a lot to learn in that depart-
ment. There were only IO or 15
people at our site at this time, and
everyone quickly got to know_
each other. For most of the day
we sat around the campfire’ cook-
ing and talking. It was still rather
cold, and the campfire was a
must.

night, I sat around with a French-

One night in particular stands
out in my mind. An Eskimo
named Bill came by that afternoon
and started to buy beer. This
pleased us all because we were
nearing bankruptcy. He dropped
$30 in the course of an evening
yet did not drink more than a few

Due to the low tolerance
Eskimos seem to have for alcohol,

The nature of the fish industry is
that it will swing from 85 percent
unemployment to a mad craving
for people in thecourse of a few
days. When the fish make their
run up the rivers, the canneries
have to have people, or the fish
rot on the docks. As a result, they
always sound encouraging, occa-
sionally throwing barbecues or
picnics when everyone seems
about to leave for another town or
another cannery.

There was a two-day halibut
opening at the beginning of June
and at each shift change (7 a.m.
and 7 p.m.). I sat in the break
room of Dragnet Fisheries hoping
the foreman might decide to hire

Leave national
anthem as it is

Oh say can you see, by the dawn’s early light.  This song was

. written by Francis Scott Key as he passed the time in a jail cell.

If some get their way, we won't be‘ singing the same ditty at foot-

’ ball games. There is a movement in the States to change our national

anthem. The reasons used most often are that it's too hard to sing
— nobody has the range -to‘ sing ”The Star Spangled Banner” well
and, it's a song about war, thus our country is condoning war by sing-

ing about it in our national anthem.

Before discrediting these pleas, we should all realize that those who
vv’ant"to' change the national anthem are causing such controversy
because they want a song they can sing and one that reminds them
of the greatness of our land. An example would be, ”America the
Beautiful.” It's a nice idea, but change isn't what we need.

. That people cannot hit the highs and lows of ”The Star Spangled
Banner” shouldn't cause them to want a new song. The fact is that
they should learn to sing. What about tradition? What about the strug-
gle and heart-felt love of country that went intoour national anthem?
The second argument is even weaker. The people whoclaim that
America's beauty isn't represented in ”The Star Spangled Banner,”
must not have listened to it closely, or at least only listened to the

first verse; And yes, it is written about war. But without the Revolu- '

tionaiy War, we'd never be able to sing about the beauty of our coun-
try, would we? ‘

The group of people who want the national anthem changed love
this country as much as those who want to keep our present anthem.
But we cannot betray our tradition by change. We don't condone
war by singing our anthem. On the contrary, we sing it to show
reverence to freedom. Freedom is what sets our nation apart from
the rest.

Women moving
quickly in 1986

1986 is well on its way to becoming the best year for women in

politics in the history of our nation. A total of -45 women sought‘

nominations for state offices or seats in Congress in the Sept. 9
primaries — 32 won their nominations. Across the country, three
women won nominations for governor in Vermont, Arizona and Con-
necticut, thus joining women already on gubernatorial ballots in
Oregon, Alaska, Nevada and Nebraska. Gubernatorial elections are
not the only campaigns in which the presence of women has been
felt. Women have been making gains in local elections for years, but
this November's election for state and national offices could show
the largest advances made for women ever. A spokesperson for the
Women's Campaign Fund predicted: ”We have a very good shot at
doubling the number of women in the Senate and governors’ man-
sions.” Many proclaim that this will be the most important year for
women in politics since 1920 —— when women won the right to vote.

The potential for the political progress of women this November
is a welcome change. Women are finally being viewed as legitimate
and qualified candidates for whichever office they choose to run for
— it's about time.

Last Wednesday's editorial on the
space shuttle is typical of the distorted
view that many Americans have of
our space program. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion (or an agency by any other name
responsible for space missions) is not
merely another unnecessary govern-
ment agency wasting our tax money
on frivolous or useless. activities.

Space flight i's’.n"o "longer an experi-
ment, it is a necessity. We routinely
use the important services of orbiting
communication, earth resource and
weather satellites. The scientific
knowledge we have obtained from

_space is invaluable. The space pro-

gram ,helps_America maintain its
technological superiority, and it is a
source of tremendous national
prestige.

All of the benefits of the space pro-
gram have always come to us at a
bargain price. NASA’s budget is, and
always has been, only a tiny percen-
tage of the federal budget. Even at the
height" of the Apollo program, it
represented only a minuscule fraction
of governmental expenditures. NASA
has done tremendous things with
such a limited budget. These
remarkable achievements, which
have permanently altered our place
in the universe (since we have left our
”cradle"), are obviously all the results
of ”high visibility” programs. Thus,
people have the mistaken view that
it is exceedingly expensive compared
to other governmental programs. It is
expensive, but not exceedingly so.
For the price of a nuclear aircraft car-
rier, we could buy two new shuttle
orbiters or build and launch several
deep-space probes.

It was a lack of funding that
resulted in the current space shuttle
design. It was a lack of funding that
dictated the use of solid-fuel rocket
motors. indirectly, it was a lack of
funding that caused Challenger to
explode.

The Soviet Union is now several
years ahead of us in space exploita-
tion and exploration. We have lost
our lead, andif the attitude remains
as it is today, we will never regain it.
The Europeans and the Japanese are
making rapid advancements in the
field, and soon their accomplish-
ments will eclipse America’s. We are
headed toward becoming a second-
rate spacefaring nation.

Space is our next frontier. It is our
future. People who laugh at these
phrases today are no better than the

LETTERS

people who laughed at Columbus,
the Wright brothers or Robert God-

. dard. We must go into space. Unfor-

tunately, most Americans seem
content to sit here on Earth and‘ let
somebody else do it.

Someday ‘we'll be sorry."

Dry Rush

In reply to Mr. Grayson’s editorial
[letter] (The Pitt News, Monday, Sept.
15, 1986), certain ideas are
misunderstood. Mr. Grayson, as a
student of the law, it is assumed that
one must have the facts of a case
before passing judgment. A person
must clarify an issue before address-

‘ ing one. You definitely failed to com-

plete this task. 1

The issue in dry rush is equityzls
the policy a fair one? Is it a
democratic plan that has bilateral
support (from both the IFC and the
university)? Assuredly, it is not. a

First, the. IFC did not approve the
dry rush in April. However, the

. university implemented its policy

with no attempt to compromise. The
fraternities are not totally against dry
rush. It is a policy that protects the
fraternities, saves money and controls
a potentially dangerous element in
our society. But the university-
sponsored policy reminds one of
George Orwell’s 7984. It is a
unilateral decision contrary to dem-
ocratic ideals.

Second, if an individual in a frater-
nity is 21 years old and wishes to
consume alcohol in his fraternity’s
house, is he wrong? Mr. Grayson,
check the Pennsylvania State Code
for Fraternal Organizations for that
issue.

Finally, when a law or policy is ad-
judicated, both the minimum and
maximum punishments must be
specified beforehand. In the case of
dry rush, the issue of punishment is
not addressed by the university. This
is called ”law with just punishment”
and ”due process.” Check the Con-
stitLition’s Bill of Rights.

‘fsoieum THE usAi"l  

Our future is in space

Without a doubt, dry rush will be 

an asset to the fraternities at Pitt, but
it must be reviewed. Alcohol is not
the main issue here; the main argu-
ment is civil liberties. Students must
dare to ask, dare to challenge and
dare to question authority."

Donnie Iris

1 would like to congratulate the Pitt
News for their promptness in cover-
ing this past‘weekend’s Donnie lris
concert. ‘Unlike previousyears, this
year's‘ paper seems to contain _more
timely journalism. However, in. its
quest for spontaneity, The Pitt News
seems to have forgotten what respon-
sible journalism is — researching the
subject,’ getting the’ facts right.

"The. article on the concert in the
park was full of misinformation. I
mean who cares what Mr. lerace, the
actual spelling of his name, was
.wearing. Iris, as he spells it for the
stage, is from"Pittsburgh and now
resides in Beaver Fal|s.~That could be
one of the reasons he is a popular
entertainer in Pittsburgh. The most
glaring error in the coverage was the
fact that lris now seems to be backed
by George Thorogood’s band, the
Destroyers. I always thought, and Iris
mentioned it at least once, that his
band's name is the Cruisers.

The warm up band, 18 Names,
were virtually overlooked in the front
page article, even though she is an
'81 Pitt graduate. Instead she is men-
tioned in a fashion show article on
page seven.

in the future please do a little more
research on your subjects and please
be a little more responsible.

Satisfaction is found in true relationships

Q. I seem to be a sexually in-
satiable woman. Not frustrated. I cer-
tainly have a good time with sex —
multiple orgasms, a feeling of release
— but then I want it all over again.
I am not in a real relationship with
any guy, maybe because I haven't
found the one who satisfies me.
Would that be it?

A. I don't think you avoid relation-
ships because you can't be satisfied.
My hunch is that you can't be
satisfied because you are not in a
relationship. You find some guy who
has everything for you — one who of-
fers companionship, mental stimula-
tion, interest in your interests,
conversation, give and take, one who
seems like your dream man — and
then you will suddenly find that sex
is satisfying. You just can't be satisfied
by butterfly studs.

Q. When we met, he wasn't in-

terested in a commitment. We had
this thing going for about three
months, and suddenly he was talk-
ing about our future together. Then
he met another woman, and he said
she was just good company, a friend.
A week after that they were lovers.
I asked, what about our future? And
he said he just couldn't choose be-
tween us. As of this morning, he still
couldn't. He has brains, charm, he's
life-enhancing —— he just can't make
up his mind. Me, I'm a snarling,
weeping mess. And in love.

A. Somebody has to make up his
or her mind, and I nominate you.
Dump the charmer. Oh, I realize you
can't because you don't want to lose
him, but in a few days you will. Why
should he have the right to turn you
into a snarling mess while he goes
around being life-enhanced? This is
not a productive relationship.

I know about being in love, but it

 

WESTI-IEIMER

isn't al~.va\_/s productive. He talked
about a future — look at your short
past with him. In that short time he
hooked up with another woman. Not

the man for you. You are going to
give him walking papers. Write to tell
me when I prove right.

Q. I am about to be married, and
my ex-boyfriend keeps calling up. No
matter what I tell him, he can't get
it through his noggin that I am going
to be a sweet, half-forgotten memory.
He is totally convinced that because
he was my first he has to be my on-
ly. And I tell him and tell him, don't
phone, but there it goes! My fiance
is upset. He says even if we get mar-
ried — ‘if! The invitations have gone
out. This maniac will be phoning up
day and night.

A. This ex could spoil not only this

present wedding plan but any future
ones you try to make. You have to
change your phone number. In the
future a court order might be neces-
sary, but for now just change the
number. Usually a jilted suitor calms

down after the knot is tied.

Q. I have never had an orgasm
through intercourse. Direct clitoral
stimulation is always needed. After

a partner brings me to orgasm, I am _

irritable and totally turned off being
fondled. This feeling never comes
after self-gratification. I've never read
anything like this in books on sex.
What causes it?

A. You should discuss this with a 

therapist or a relationship counselor
because no one can diagnoseyour
problem without asking many ques-
tions. It is possible that you expect.an
orgasm from intercourse and resent
not having it. Your feelings about this
may need adjustment, and that isn't
done instantly by pushing any button
that I know about. Or you may have
something against your partner, or
against all partners, which has to be
resolved.

Are record albums becomingobsolete?  

This is one of those problems
brought on by rampaging technology
— one of those problems that
threatens to drive me crazy.

Everyone who has heard them says
that compact disc players are the

. coming thing in music. Compact disc

players are used to get music out of
compact discs — "CDs" — and the
sound quality is said to be phenom-
enal. Compact discs are much
smaller than record albums and pro-
vide no hisses, scratches or pops.

A Plus, they allegedly last forever — the.

sound quality of a CD is always just
as good as the first time that you
played it.

Right now the demand for compact
discs and compact disc players far
outstrips the supply. CD manufactur-
ing plants are going up all across the
United States; some industry ob-'
servers are predicting sales of 300
million CD5 a year by 1990. CD5 are
more expensive than record albums,
but that doesn't seem to bother
people.

I am very upset about this. Over the
years there have been many false
alarms about coming- trends in the

recording industry -— quadraphonic -

sound is one that was introduced and
then fizzled — but by every indica-
tion, CD5 are the genuine article.

There I was, walking up Semple
Street to the corner at Bates, when I
noticed the traffic which was roaring
by at high speed. I had to wait on the
sidewalk for half a minute or so until
it was safe to cross. When crossing
Bates Street, at least I'm heartened by
the predictability of the traffic; the
cars will not stop for me. The roads
belong to cars; pedestrians are
second-class. I actually felt safer as
there was no light at that-intersection
for anyone to run through it like it
didn't exist.

Today, I decided to stroll up At-
wood, which despite it's litter, is still

a pleasant little part of Oakland. I like '

the international flavor there, a little
something for everyone. But as I tried
to cross Atwood near the post office,
I was almost hit twice by motorists
racing to make the red light at Forbes.
Still with me?

The traffic on Forbes is something
between a fire zone and a wild-west
show. Stand there someday (any in-

They're going to catch on.

So the question is: What are those ‘

of us who grew up collecting record
albums supposed to do with all of our
old albums? You can't play a record
album on a CD machine, and it
would be prohibitively costly to
replace all the old albums with CD
versions — assuming that CD ver-
sions of the old albums are even
made.

There are whole generations of
Americans who have shelf after shelf
of record albums in their homes. It
is almost a ritual: Every time one of
us moves, we crate up all the _old
albums and lug them along. In
monetary terms, record albums are
among our biggest investments.

This all dates back to the days
when buying record albums was as

_ much a part of our lives as buying

bread at the grocery store. The
albums didn't seem like luxuries;
they were necessities. In preparation
for writing this column, I went

through my albums and counted
them. Four-hundred-ninety-four.
That's correct — I own 494 record
albums, purchased over a 20-year
period, and I know that I am not
alone in having that many. Real
music fanatics probably have

t   ff ' '
tersection will do) and watch how
many people have no regard for red
lights. Or pedestrians.

There you are, dear reader, in my
shoes. The shoes are planted
millimeters from the hundreds of cars
which barrel by at an unbelievably
high speed and low altitude. To the
left of the size nine sneakers are some
foreign exchange students, 20 of
them, identical down to the moles on
their chins. To the right of the
sneakers is one of those pesky
cockroaches that I've moaned about,
the ones that look like the critters in
the movie Aliens. The light begins to
change, and the traffic builds up
speed. They are all trying to make a
few more feet down Forbes before
they have to break to a halt. The air
stinks of monoxide, the light turns
red. Wisely, I keep the shoes planted
on the safety of the sidewalk, but the
seven-foot-tall roach is new in town,
and it steps out onto Forbes. Quicker
than you can say ”Gee," the roach

 

thousands.

As I flipped through my record
albums, the covers brought back
flashes of nostalgia. Ijrnade notes of

» the titles of 20 albums that I came

across at random while making my
search. Each of them meant
something to me:

All American Boy, by Rick Der-
ringer; Aqualung, by Jethro Tull;
Turn! Turn! Turn! by the Byrds; So
Long, Bannatyne, by the Guess Who;
Roots, by the Everly Brothers; Blonde
on Blonde, by Bob Dylan;
Wilderness Road, by the band of the
same name; Last of the Red Hot Bur-

a hazard

looks like an ex-roach, resplendent
with the tire tracks that were left on
it by the Camaro which tore through
the red light. The exchange students

ritos, by the Flying Burrito Brothers;
Aladdin Sane, _by David Bowie;
Gord's Gold, by Gordon Lightfoot;
Pet Sounds, by the Beach Boys; Shine
On Brightly, by Proccul Harum; The
Best of Mountain; Only the Lonely,
by Frank Sinatra; The Low Spark of
High-Heeled Boys, by Traffic; Are
You Ready for the Country, by
Waylon Jennings; Still Crazy After All
These Years, by Paul Simon; Layla,
by Derek and the Dominos;
December’s Children (And Every-
body's), by the Rolling Stones; Aloha
From Hawaii Via Satellite, by Elvis
Presley.

There is no way that I can ever
replace all those albums by purchas-
ing CDs. Yet more than one music
expert has been quoted as saying that
long-playing albums will soon be ob-
solete; "cassette tapes have already
dealt them a crushing body blow,
and CD5 will be the knockout punch.

To get some perspective on this, I
got in touch with the most astute per-
son I know on musical matters: Bob
Stroud, host of a radio show called
"Rock and Roll Roots," and a genius
on the subject of old records.

"Don't panic,” Stroud said.
"Record albums are always going to
be with us. They're not going to go

the way of 8-track tapes. There are
just too many record albums in cir-
culation for that to happen.”

Stroud said that he has a CD player
at home and that he loves it. How-
ever, he said, he still keeps his stereo
hooked up to play record albums,
and he believes that this is what most
people will end up doing.

”We may be the last generation to
purchase record albums,” he said.
"But until we go away, you're still go-
ing to see most houses with stereos

right next to the CD players. People

will have both.

”And I think that you will still be
able to go out and buy a record. In
our «lifetime, records will never
become obsolete.”

I guess that solves one of my wor-
ries. But I have another. My record
player has gone wacky; right now I

can't even play any albums. When- -

ever I switch it on, the turntable starts
to spin at about 1,000 revolutions per
minute. I'm serious. It goes so fast that
it literally throws records into the air.
Even when the record is gone, the
turntable is going so fast that it looks
as if it might take off, like a helicopter.

Has anyone else ever had this ,

problem?

to life and limb  

and I look to our left, the traffic has
halted, and we cross the intersection.
Forbes isn't so bad, at least not in
comparison to Fifth. Fifth does not
have sidewalks which smell as bad
as those on Forbes, but here we find
a new menace — the dreaded bus
lane. Seriously, does anybody know
how many innocent humans have
been crushed under the buses there?
If one person killed or maimed was
too many, how many more plus that
must be run over before something
is done about that? Where are all of
Pittsburgh's finest, who deny having
ticket quotas but are too happy to
trump things up on holiday
weekends? Why don't they ticket
buses? WHY CAN'T WE GET
”SLOW SCHOOL ZONE” SIGNS
POSTED AROUND CAMPUS?
Oakland gets more than its share
of traffic, and I can understand that
our police can't nab every traffic of-
fender, especially if they're sipping
coffee inside some restaurant, but I

get so angry when I see motorists
flagrantly run. red lights. Since streets
around here are city property, don't
look to our campus police forhelp,
though I wish they'd put their coffee
down and pull people over to warn

the speeding or reckless drivers that

human beings do not come equipped
with a ton and a half of steel
surrounding them. Maybe our good
police could carry a portfolio of torn,
crumpled bodies, those of humans
who put some faith in the meaning
of a red light or a speed limit.

Just think, how many of those low
flying maniacs will be drunk? Just
think of the revenue that could go in-
to the city's coffers from the process-
ing of their crimes. I want to see more
cooperation between campus and ci-
ty police, not apathy. If anyone out
there agrees that crossing an Oakland
street is unsafe, then write to me here,
armed with your complaints, I'll rat-
tle my sword. Maybe we'll get
something done.

Pika   honored for

By Milton Klopfer

For The Pitt News

The Pi Kappa Alpha national frater-
nity recently honored Pitt's PIKA
chapter with two awards for chapter
excellence.

PIKA received not only the Nestor
Award; given for the best Pi Kappa
Alpha Alumni Association in the na-
tion, but also a Chapter Excellence
Award.

This award is given yearly to the
few PIKA chapters, out of the 180 na-
tionwide, that are rated for overall ex-
cellence in their evalulations by a
national fraternity representative.

Thirty chapters received the award -

this year.
According to PIKA chapter presi-

. dent Jim lSlu’ck, this is the first time.
in its 60 year history that the Pitt .

chapter has received the award. S_luck
said the evaluation covers the entire
spectrum of fraternity life.

The ‘chapter is judged . in such

. catagoriess as alumni"-relations, ex-

ecutive committee, finances, pledge

programs, rushing, campus involvef - .
ment and general involvement in the ’

Greek system. _
Pitt's PIKA chapter was rated

strongest in the categories of alumni

EG

chapter excellence

relations, finances and executive
committee.

According to Sluck, the efforts of
the other members of the chapter's
executive board played an, important
role in earning the award. These
members include Brendan Walsh,
Andy Novak, Chuck Farineloa, Steve
Zucker and Tom Vater. '

He also acknowledged former ad-43
visor Larry Lunsford and the PIKA '

alumni.

”We’re just proud as heck!” said
Sluck. ”We still have to work a little
harder and make the little extra effort
to push it over the top to get the

Smvthe."
The Smythe Award is given at the_

end of the year to the top ‘1 5 Chapter
Excellence Award winners.
Vice—President Brendan Walsh
shares Sluck’s enthusiasm. ”We
didn't realize that the work that we
did would rate as excellent until we

were told," he said. "We thought were; .
did what anyone would have done. ' V

Now we know we have the poten-'
tial. It's a matter of hanging on."

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 17,1986

By Craig Pearson

Staff Writer

According to city and campus
police reports, in one week alone
(Sept. 8 to 15) three purses and two
10-speed bicycles were stolen. Three
cars were broken into; the value of
the items stolen from the cars totaled
$4,001. Items stolen from three
apartments were valued at $650. All
the above occurred in the campus
area. There were also two gold
‘ necklaces taken from students by the

' Forbes entrance to the Towers.

Purses that are stolen are usually
placed on the ﬂoor when working or
dining in a fast food restaurant. When
you sit down, take a second to think
where your valuables are and how
easily they can be stolen.

According to city reports, the main
problem in the area is theft. Purses,
bikes and items in cars are the things
most often stolen.

’'If possible, don't take a purse with
you,” said campus police Sergeant
Charles Grier. ‘

For those of you who bike into
school. there are some things you can

do to protect your mode of transpor-
tation.

Grier said to invest in a good lock.
There are at least two brands of locks
with case-hardened steel that can't be
cut like most of the locks that are in
use now. These cheaper locks can be

‘cut with a set of bolt cutters.

For the names of these locks and
other protection ideas, call Sgt. Grier
or Officer Stiger at 624-4040.

Breaking into cars is another area
crime. The first way to protect your
things is to lock your doors. But

.sometimes that iust won't do.

Police urge students to protect valuables

Criminals can break windows with
their hands or rocks. However, there
is a way to try to cut down on these
incidents.

"If you are planning on leaving
anything in your car, put it in your
trunk,” said Grier.

It doesn't matter how small or
worthless the item is, it makes the
thief take another look at your car.
Grier also said that tradesmen should
be especially careful. Tools are very
big on the stolen items list.

As for the amount of money you
should havewith you, Grier advised

to plan that day's activites and figure
out how much things will cost you;
Only take a few extradollars with
you, so if you get ripped off, it won't
be for that much. _

These are just a few things to pro-
tect yourself and your things. The
best tip is just think about the situa-
tion you're in.

was a spooner.
The halibut, a large, fat-bottom
fish weighing 50-200 pounds,
were first guillotined and gutted.
They were then passed to me, and
I scraped out the remaining guts
with a spoon. It was the most

_ mind-deadening thing I had ever

done, yet I was thankful to be
working at all.

I moved my camp to the new
cannery and worked one more
day when the fish ran out. I didn't
see another fish for a month.

Every day I sat in the break
room on the off—chance that they
might need to have something
done. Occasionally I would get
hired for odds and ends. After; the
first week in June, when I made
about $100, my next four checks
read: $87, $22, $23 and $44.

I did meet some great-people,
however, and I think this was the
most enjoyable part of the trip. It
was light 20 hours a day, and we
had little to do but sit around,
play tunes, meet people and
drink. For the solstice, we had a
party on the beach and watched
the sun dip below the horizon,
then reappear two hours later.

I finally got fed up with the
pathetic management and peren-
nial lies of the cannery and head-
ed off to Valdez on the ferry.

Valdez is a tourist town nestled
into a picturesque fjord on Prince
William Sound. Five-thousand-foot
mountains rise out of the sea all
around the town. The Alaskan
Pipeline Terminus is located

" Tl-IE PITT NEWS,"Wednesdoy, Sepféfnber 17, 1986

across the water, and there are

-two canneries.

The townspeople dislike the
cannery workers because they
make the town look tacky for the
tourists. Most of us were camped
on the side of a large hill behind
the dock for the ferry so that
when the tourists came, the first
thing they saw was the maze of
tents on _the hill.

The Town Council voted to
evict us-, and we were moved to
what amounted to a refugee
camp. They bulldozed an area
about half the size of a football
field and laid pallets out in a grid
with about five feet between each
one. It rained continually by this
time so the entire area quickly
turned to mud.

Bottle rockets exploded at all
hours of the night, so I often slept
in the park or the library. I was
too broke to buycdecent food so
my diet consisted mainly of
peanut butter and jelly, bananas

and candy bars.

There was some slime-line work
yet the season was the worst in re-
cent memory for the Valdez area.

One fourth of the pink salmon
of the year before were caught
and as a result, my longest work
week was thirty-five hours.

After a month I had to get ‘out
of there and I hitchhiked back to
Anchorage. I was picked up by a
lady biker in a pickup just outside
of Valdez. She explained that she
was headed toward Anchorage but
was going to spend the night at
her camp on the banks of the

miles into the interior).

Chitina was founded by the
Kennicott Copper Company in the
early 1900s. They built a railroad
through Chitina from the Pacific
and on to copper and silver mines
farther into the interior. When the
ore ran out, the workers left, Ken-
nicott Copper left, and Chitina
became a ghost town.

Today there are about 100 peo-
ple there, predominantly Alaskan
Indian. Model A Fords and old,
rusted trucks are interspersed with
the two liquor stores and three
bars that provide the focus for the
Chitina economy.

It was early Friday evening
when we arrived, and the vast ma-
jority of the town was on a binge.
(Alcoholism has to be the largest
problem confronting the Alaskan
natives today. Nearly every Indian
I met during my time in Alaska
was drunk.)

We camped out by the river and
the next day drove on to the
lady's home in Palmer. She and
her husband, a boilermaker in the
Alaskan bush, live in a Quonset
hut with their 15-year-old son. A
Quonset is a dome-shaped military
building like those on Comer
Pyle. —

Her husband and son were get-
ting high, a common sight in
Alaska, and working on one of the
12 motorcycles in their front yard
when we pulled into the
driveway. After a healthy feeding I
hitched to Anchorage and flew
home. .

I think it was the people I met
who made my trip worthwhile.
The cannery worker is the lowest
form of life in the eyes of
Alaskans, yet this has a positive
side. A bond is forged between
Cannery workers as a result.
Hardened criminals wouldn't con-
sider stealing from anyone’s tent.
People would share food or help
with your campsite or whatever.
You had to trust and live with
each other, and, for the most part,
everyone realized this.

On the negative side, I really
disliked being lied to and having
to take crap from the foremen at
the canneries. I had no money so
I had to take it, andthey knew it.
That whole part of it has made me
a bit cynical. In an attempt to
avoid being put in such unsavory
positions in the future, I have
changed my major from political
science to economics.

I would still recommend a sum-
mer in Alaska for anyone who is
bored and looking for adventure,
or questioning the often _
hypocritical values of oursociety.
There's something about Alaska
that allowed me to see things very
clearly. It's definitely worth ex-
periencing.

The. agenda for the federal in-

Kolibash told the Post-Gazette

or groups of individuals, some of

Panthers

iugsﬁns
starters

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

When the Pitt Panthers square off
against the Purdue Boilermakers this
Saturday in West Lafayette, lnd., they
will field a team with many new faces
in the lineup. .

Due to injuries and player demo-
tions, the Panthers could have as
many as seven new starters in the
lineup this weekend.

Coach Mike Gottfried, in an at-
tempt to set a fire under his 0-1-1
team, demoted four starters on
Monday. V

Junior All-America candidate Bob
Sign is expected to be replaced by
redshirt freshman Bill Cherpak at left
guard, while center Chip Backauskas,
a junior from North Allegheny High
School, will be spelled by junior Ed
Miller.

Senior flanker Chuck Scales, who
has caught only five passes for 40
yards in Pitt's first two games, has
been dropped to second-team status
behind sophomore Bill Osborn.

Gottfried surprised everyone by
moving senior outside linebacker
Steve Apke to the second team
behind juniorlerry Wall. Apke, a tri-
captain and leading tackler for the
Panthers last season, is one of six All-
America candidates on this year's Pitt
squad.

Gottfried’s reasoning for the
changes is simple. The Panthers need
a spark. ”l’m just trying to find the
right combination,” said Gottfried.
”l’m looking for leadership in some
areas, and I'm hoping somebody will
jell for us a little bit. What you would
like to see happen sometimes is to
have someone come in and ignite the
ballclub.”

Despite the demotions, Gottfried
didn't rule out the possibility that
Sign, Backauskas, Scales and Apke
could have their starting positions
back by the end of this week.

body I know I'll never see again, I feel
like I am losing a part of me, that I'll
be missing out on something im-
portant.

I don't know what to expect this
weekend, but the one thing that I am
sure of is that the Purdue I-actually
visit will be quite different from the
one I remember. _

One of my most vivid memories of
Purdue is from a night in early
December '83, a few days before
finals began. Indiana got hit with the
first big snowfall of the year. The
snow began falling early in the morn-

mg and continued all day. By
nightfall there was seven inches on
the ground. I remember walking back
from class and looking at the green,
red and blue Christmas lights on my
dormitory. They were blurry because
the wind made my eyes watery and
it was tough to see. When I walk up
that street this weekend I think it will
not be at all like the street I
remember. Gone will be the snow
and the Christmas lights. In their
place will be cars stuck in traffic,
students riding bikes and music blar-
ing from fraternity row one block
over. Or was it two blocks?

I know that the tailgate parties
before the game will be the same. I
suppose most Pitt students have
never been to a ”real” tailgate par-
ty; the one at the Syria Mosque just
doesn't cut it. But at Purdue the cars
would arrive early and bring out the

food. There were cars from all-over :

the Midwest. Alums from Illinois,
Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio and all cor-
ners of Indiana. The smell of ham-
burgers and steaks frying on portable
grills used to wake me up on football
Saturdays. My dorm was right across
the street from the stadium. Some
people would walk down to the end
of the hall and look out that window

Marshall lork/T he Pitt News

The Pitt Panther soccer team hosts St. Francis tonight at Pitt Stadium.

Vargas finds life no day at beach

By Mike Bodek
For The Pitt News

At first glance you can tell there is
something different about soccer
playerjeff Vargas. His deep-set tan

gives away the fact that he's not a.

local boy. The tan is not the type you
would get laying out at Point State
Park. It is a beach tan. A Virginia

. Beach tan.

Vargas, a sophomore, grew up in
Virginia Beach and enjoys the sand
and surf life. But don't get the wrong
idea. He is by no means a typical
beach bum.

One might think that youngsters
growing up in a beach area, with its
laid-back lifestyle, may not be com-
petitive athletes. That is far from the
truth with Vargas.

”From northern Virginia on down
through the state, you see ‘soccer
fields everywhere," Vargas said.
"When I was in high school, I would
play about 110 games a year.”\/Ve'd

go to tournaments and play five
games in three days. That's where
you're going to get experience."

And experience is something
Vargas has. He is now a starter for the
Panthers and doing an admirable job.

’’I think Jeff has made a lot of im-
provements from his freshman year,”
said Coach Joe Luxbacher. ”He’s a
physically strong player who has
good skills. I think he's still learning
our system and how we want him to
play. He's a good, solid player and
we're looking for good things from
him.”

Vargas, in turn, has high praise for

for Luxbacher. "He's an excellent
coach,” commented Vargas. "He

gets out there and plays with us. He's
not a coach who hasn't played the
game and doesn't know the ropes.
Look at his credentials. He's played
professional soccer, so if he says
something, it's for a purpose. The
players respect him and his coaching

techniques."

When Vargas is not playing soccer
he does spend time on the beach, but
not always in a recreational manner.

He was a lifeguard this summer after -
receiving his training in a course at

Pitt.

A business major, Vargas is begin-
ning to set his sights on the future,
and it looks as if it will be a bright
one for him.

’’I want to coach soccer and hope
to startmy own business,” Vargas
said. "When it comes to money, I
have a knack for making it."

There have been many adjustments

and lifestyle changes for Vargas since '

coming to Pittsburgh. The more hec-
tic city environment, the cold
weather and public transportation are
all new to Vargas. Virginia Beach has
no public transit system, so riding a
PAT bus was a new experience for
him — as is life in Pittsburgh, without
the surf.

Pitt soccer team
ready for St. Francis

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther’s soccer team puts
its 2-0 record on the line in tonights
home game against St. Francis
University.

”They are a very physical team."
says Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher. ’’It is
a big game for both teams. They (St.
Francis) pulled a tie over the
weekend, and we were lucky to
come away with a win. So it will be
tough.

''In our game against Slippery Rock
on Saturday, we played very ragged.
For 15 minutes we would play very
good, hitting the passes, and playing
tough defense. Then the next 15
minutes we would just kick the ball
around, and not play with much in-

tensity. They (Slippery Rock) played
that way too, but it was tough."

St. Francis has a returning starter
who scored ten goals last year, so the
Pitt defense will loom big in the
game. Pitt goalie Mark Hendricks will
have to play another solid game to
keep the game close. ”Our offense
has been kind of anemic," com-
mented coach Luxbacher. ”|t's not
that we don't have the players, it's
just that they are not concentrating
out there. They are trying to do what
I am saying, it's just not coming
naturally. Luckily our defense has
been solid, but we need to score
more points to have a successful
season.”

The game starts at 7:15,-p'.m., and

‘ both teams will be ready-riot a war.

’'I hope," said assistant coach Gee
Peckich, ”that our team is ready, and
that we can come away with a win.”

continued from page I2
right into the stadium. I never did
that. I wouldn't have missed a game
for a million dollars.

I went to all of Purdue's home
games. I saw them get clobbered by
Notre Dame and crushed by Illinois.
I even sat through the Northwestern
game. They played that game at
night, the first night game ever at
Ross-Ade Stadium. CBS, in an ex-
treme example of poor planning,
broadcast the game regionally. Pur-
due won 48-17. .

The first newspaper story I ever
wrote was for Purdue's student

newspaper The Exponent. It was a.

story about the Purdue ski club. Yes,
I know. I laughed too when I found
out Purdue had a ski club. It's tough
to ski in Indiana where there are no
hills above 150 feet. The editor didn't
think it was so funny and told me to
find out exactly how Purdue did

come to have a ski team. I thought

a ski team at Purdue was about as
sensible as a surfing team at Kansas,
but the editor didn't. He thought it
was a good story. I did the story and
my journalism career was off to a
brilliant start. And I did find out Pur-
due has a ski team — they go to
Michigan every weekend to practice.
There is a way around everything.
All these memories and more will
come back this weekend. I will be
reminded of things that I had com-
pletely forgotten about. Some
memories’ will be painful, others
joyous. It's like when you have to go

T back to your old high school for some

reason. You still feel like you belong
while you drive up to it. And as you
walk the empty halls, ghosts long
since past are beside you. The voices
are heard again. The past is realized
and then is gone. There comes a time
when you know you don't belong

anymore; that this is no longer your 
place, and it is time to move on. But '

 

those memories seem so real.

Memories are very important. They
are reminders, they are security
blankets. They let us know that we
have been this way before and we
know what to do, what to expect.

There is one memory I have from
Purdue that every college student
who has ever lived away from home
has as well. It is at that time when you
really let go of your parents. Of all
the memories I will have of college,
none will likely be more bittersweet
than the ones Ihave of that first day
after my parents dropped me off and
I was alone. That is perhaps the
greatest panic I have ever felt, and I
know I am not alone.

So this weekend I w_ill go back, go
home in a way. I will come face to
face with the memories, the frustra-
tions, ”the triumphs and broI<‘en
dreams.

This weekend I am in for. much
more than aegame. \

THE PITT News, Wednesday, September 17, 1986

Panthers

await
tourney

By Beth Froelich

Sta ff Writer

The Pitt Men's Tennis Team and
Coach George Dieffenbach willhead
to Rhode island this weekend to com-
pete in the Big East Championships.
Their main competition will be
Boston College, last year's winner,
and St. John's, whom Pitt tied last
year for second place.

Both St. John's and Boston College
lost many of their senior players last
season. Pitt, on the other hand, has
five of its six players returning.

”We have a good chance of win-
ning this year. Our team is experi-
enced and has worked hard over the
summer. It will take a lot of hard
work and effort, but they are well
prepared to bring back the Big East
Championships to Pitt,” commented
Coach George Dieffenbach.

Sophomore Neil Meyerowich will
play in the No. 1 singles spot for Pitt
at the Championships. Meyerowich
reached the semifinals last year play-
ing No. 2 singles. .

Freshman Paul Maben will play in
his first Big East Championship for Pitt
in the No.2 singles slot. Maben is ex-
pected to be a strong contender.

Junior Greg Campbell, the 1985-86
team MVP, will be a threat to win,
playing No. 3 singles for the team. In
last year's tournament, Maben made
it to the semifinals playing No. 5
singles.

Senior Rich Monteleone is an ex-
perienced player and should be com-
petitive, playing No; 4 singles for the
Panthers. Monteleone progressed to
semifinal play in No. 6 singles play
in last year's tournament.

Senior David Johnson is also a
returning player with a lot of court ex-
perience. He will play No. Ssingles
for the team. Playing No. 4 singles
last year at the Championship, he
made it to the semifinal round of
play.

Returning senior Jeff Dadowski, the
1984-85 te_am MVP, will play No. 6
singles.
make a strong showing at the Big East
Championships.

In doubles play last year, all three
of the Pitt men's doubles teams made
it to the finals and finished second in
their respective matches. This year's
doubles line-up, is equally impressive.

Playing No. 1 doubles will be
Meyerwich and Maben.‘ Playing No.
2 will be Johnson and Dador, and at
No. 3 will be Campbell and
Monteleone.

The Championship will be held Fri-
day, Saturday and Sunday at the
Weekapaug Tennis Club in Rhode

Island. After gruelling three-and-a-half.

hour practices, there is no doubt the
team is physically prepared. As
Coach Dieffenbach ‘said, ”No one
will be tired on the court.”

The Pitt Men's Tennis Team has the
determination and talent to sweep
the Big East Tennis Championships
this year. ”This is the best Pitt Men's
Tennis Team I've coached in my 12
years of coaching here. They have a
tremendous opportunity to establish
themselves this year as the Big East
Champions,” commented Dief-
fenbach.
