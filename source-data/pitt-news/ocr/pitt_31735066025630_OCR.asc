Jason Hillman
Editor in Chief

“Be nice to him,” presidential candidate Ross
Perot said, referring to a heckler. “He’s getting
paid.”

Yesterday, in front of thousands of supporters
in the David L. Lawrence Convention Center,
Perot revealed more serious allegations of
Republican “dirty tricks.”

He spoke of reports from prominent
Republicans telling him that his family was to
be attackedby a smear campaign, which
included releasing a computer-edited photo of
his daughter Carolyn and a plan to disrupt her
wedding, which occurred on Aug. .23.

“I could not allow my daughter’s greatest
moment destroyed by people who would do
anything to win,” Perot said.

Although he implicated the Republican Party

as the instigator of the alleged plans, he refused I

to give speciﬁcs. At a press conferenceafter the
rally, he gave another statement on the allega~
tions and then said he would refuse to answer
any questions on the incident. \Vhen one
reporter repeatedly asked why the wedding
had not been postponed until after the election,
Perot responded, “I am 62 years old, and I have
just heard the dumbest question anybody could
ever ask me.”

Perot said that he didn’t tell his daughter

about the reports until after her honeymoon.
Her response, he said, was, “The weddings
over, the honeymoon’s over, get back in the
race.”

Perot said he commented on the allegations

because the TV news show 60 Minutes was

doing a story on the situation.
“I couldn’t say [the reports] were true, but I

couldn’t take that risk,” Perot said.

Perot’s comments on the allegations took up
only a small part of the nearly three—hour rally
downtown. The convention center was packed
with chanting Perot supporters who gave Perot
and his wife Margo, who is from Greensburg
and was born in Mercy Hospital, a frve—minute
ovation.

“You and I are here because we cherished
the "principals the country was founded upon,”
Perot said to the cheering crowd.

Perot emphasized a need for the United
States to increase the manufacturing of prod-
ucts and accused the government of being “for
sale.” He repeated the fact that he would not

has not taken any special interest money dur-
ing his campaign.

“In plain Texas talk, I don’t owe anybody
anything, but I owe you all everything,” Perot
said.

Perot spoke about the debates he participat-
ed in last week. “The only reason they let me
on was they thought I would embarrass you.
Now they’re sony they did.”-

Perot and other speakers attackedlthe per-
ception that Perot has no chance in becoming
president. Recent polls show Perot having as
much as 19 percent of the vote.

“People are telling you that you are wasting
your vote. If I saw this [rally], I would be trying
to slow you down too,” Perot said.

“\\'/hy is it when we say we are voting for
Ross Perot, the media says it is a wasted vote?”
asked Stephanie Limbert, a coordinator for
United We Stand, the organization behind
Perot’s campaign.

The administration is looking
into the possibility of disciplin-
ing students for off-campus
misconduct, according to Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs
William Harmon.

Under pressure from the resi-
dents of surrounding commu-
nities, Pitt officials are begin-
ning to rethink the traditional
boundaries of their disciplinary
grasp over students. Some
community residents say the
student party scene off campus
has become too disruptive and
dangerous.

Harmon said he favors the

off-campus actions through

reports from other students

The Student Government
Board is helping off-campus
students deal with landlord

:8 ‘problems, including perhaps

the big-gest problem — Saad
Ibrahim. _
From information gathered

-in the commuter research

center, SGB board member

 Christopher Skutches present-
 ed documented complaints to

fellow SGB members Friday

3- on Ibrahim dating back to

1990.

He said he learned that
Ibrahim has been running his
business using the alias Fariel
Hantour and various bogus
addresses and phone num-

‘ bers.

Ibrahim, the landlord of

— 533 Melwood Ave., was fined

$44,000 by the City of
Pittsburgh Public Safety
Office last year.

Further describing
Ibral1im’s business conduct,
Skutches said the Black

Action Society has been
informed of allegations that
Ibrahim refuses to rent to
African Americans.

Skutches is currently setting
up meetings with Oakland
City Council Representative
Jack Wagner and Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs
William Harmon to help deal
with the situation.

In another off-campus
problem, Skutches presented
documentation showing that
Daran Management owes
$20,862 for its water bill and
that the residents of 5821
Dawson St. will have their
water turned off on Oct. 26 if
the bill is not paid.

Skutches said that State
Attorney General Dorcas
Turner could be contacted by
students having landlord
problems at 565-5394,

Other issues addressed at
Friday’s meeting:

0 President Gil Golden said
the SGB couldn’t do anything
about the noise in the quad
caused by pep rallies.

“I personally support
school spirit at these pep ral-
lies, but there is nothing to
say that [the SGB] can inter-
fere with them,” Golden said.

Golden suggested that
since the noise time is so
short, students could either
just wait it out or go to
Hillman Library.

“This is not meant to be
sarcastic,” he added. “But it is
in my opinion a small incon-
venience.”

0 Golden reminded stu-
dents that there will be a
seminar held to teach stu-
dents how to read the univer-
sity budget on Oct. 29 in 121
David Lawrence Hall at noon.

0 The search for affordable
office spacefor 160 Pitt stu-
dent groups has gone off
campus, and Golden encour-

agedall SGB members to

help.
0 Golden announced that a
teleconference dealing with

campus sexual harassment

has been scheduledfor Nov.

0 Jacob Brody said that he
is undergoing negotiations
with the University Budget
Policies Committee to have
two student representatives,
one from -the SGB and one
from the CGS Student
Government.

“The nature of the two stu-
dent governments is very dif-
ferent,” he said, adding that
those different needs can’t be
properly represented by just
one student.

ting the date for commence-
ment. Advertisements will be

ing feedback for setting the

“If we don’t get any

will set the date to whatever
they want,” Brody said.

Poland, Fantin elected
BiGALA co-presidents

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

John Fantin and Robin Poland were elected co-presi-
dents of BiGALA at last Thursday night’s meeting.

Members of BiGALA elected the officers as well as a
new business manager as the result of former co-
President Linda Jarrett’s resignation and some recent
fragmentation within the group, Fantin said.

As a new member, Fantin said he accepted the nomi-
nation because he wanted to take a part in combating
homophobia on campus.

“‘I feel it’s important to reach out to the bisexual, gay
and lesbian [students] on campus," he said.

He said that dealing with homosexuality in America is
tough, and that he hopes to help create an environment
on campus in which people can “comelout.”

“It’s a matter of being open with your sexuality,”
Fantin said.

Poland has been at Pitt for two years and joined

BiGALA last March. She was initially reluctant.but finally
accepted the nomination for the position after another
member promised to help with the responsibilities of the
office.
, Poland said she is committed to‘ the continuation of
BiGALA. “If you want an organization to continue, you
have to do your part, and we need to solidify a member-
ship,” she said. “Things got a little fragmented [after
Jarrett’s resignation], and now we’re going to pick up the
pieces.”

Poland said that she has a goal for BiGALA. “It’s time
we reached out to faculty members and administrators.
We want to getthe point across to them that BiGALA is
here.” She stressed the importance of developing a cam-
pus—wide awareness of the organization.

Moira Meadows, the new business manager, first went
to a BiGALA meeting with a friend who was a member.
Meadows, a heterosexual, said she was interested in the
job because “people need support.”

“I really want the organization to continue, because
homosexual and bisexual members of minority groups
and their friends need a place to go, to socialize and feel
safe,” Meadows said.

Even though the position means work, Meadows said
the important thing is to help keep the group running
efficiently.

Poland has already organized an event in which local
gay artists will be able to exhibit their artwork on Nov.
10 and 13.

Engineering students bar/e lives also

For The Pitt News

Jeannette Johnson said she
does not believe in the popu-
lar misconception that most
engineering students spend
their Thursday nights in a
computer lab.

Johnson, president of the
Engineering Student Council,
said one of her duties is to
help plan social events for Pitt
engineering students.

One of her major goals is to
get more engineers involved in
council activities.

“We do social activities —— a
hayride, intramural sports —
and we also sponsored a cor-
porate exposition which was a

job fair that was held a few
weeks ago," Johnson said.

The highlight of the year for
the council is Engineer's
Week, Johnson said. This is
seven days of competition and
games between different
groups of engineers. Each
department competes against
one another.

“It is the only week engi-
neers are allowed to have fun.
Professors in all the depart-
ments don’t schedule tests that
week. It's something fun that
most engineers should get
involved with,” she said.

The council also publishes a
bulletin every three weeks that
is available to students in
Benedum Hall.

  
    
  
  
 

  

“It’s basically engineering-
related topics such as current
social events, research topics
and other topics that most
engineering students would be
interested in," said bulletin
publisher, Andrea Passarello.

Johnson urges first-year
engineering students to
become involved with council-
sponsored events.

"You get to meet a lot of
upperclassmen, which will
benefit freshman because
lupperclassmenl can help first-
year students in academic diffi-
culty," Johnson said.

“One of my personal goals is
to let engineers know that the
Council and events are open to
them,” she said.

was an outright protest.

“We are trying to get our-
selves together. We are not out
here to have a good time,”
Wiley said. “We have to be uni-
fied because the university

 ’ doesn’t care about our needs.”

’ Many of the other students at

 I the concert, who did not attend

the rally, did not understand

 the actions of the BAS students.

Sophomore Geoffrey

Grabowski asked Wiley,

I ‘‘What’s the point of the

demonstration?” Wiley said,

I" “We don’t have to justify our

actions to anyone but our-
selves.”

Grabowski said he had noth-
ing else to say but wanted to
let a quote of the Jamaican reli-
gious figure, Haile Selassie,
speak for him:

“Until the color of a man’s
skin is of no more significance
than the color of his eyes, there
will be nothing but war.”

Senior Todd Cable, PPC
director of the Homecoming
activities, said he could not
understand why any student
would feel the Homecoming
events discriminated against his
or her particular culture.

“I tried to make sure there
were enough culturally diverse
events,” Cable said. “How

could anyone not enjoy fire-

works?”

The BAS students said the
reason for their actions went
deeper than the bands chosen
for the Homecoming concert.

It was instead a culmination
of the frustration felt by
African—American students as
a result of a university that
does not respect minority
needs and instead caters to the
white majority.

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor said that every six
to eight weeks, open forums
are held for anyone who wants
to come and express their
concerns. He added that these

meetings are poorly atten-
ded.

O’Connor said that he has
gone even further and has
set up an appointment with
BAS President Marcus Guy to
discuss the group’s concerns.
He added that .he is willing to
talk about the possibility of a
black cultural center.

Guy, who did not attend the
Homecoming concert, agreed
that the university has taken
steps toward addressing the
needs of the African—American
student body.

“[O’Connor] appears to be
concerned,” Guy said, noting

identified as disruptive could
be subject to “administrative
suspension or, depending on
the severity of the behavior,
administrative dismissal,”

Harmon said. A
Harmon, who said he has
heard of no othe_r school that
does this,‘ has been -meeting
with publicsafety and Pitt’s
legal counsel to discuss the
feasibility of the new idea. ‘
“I don’t know if legally we
can do it,” Harmon said. “It’s

something we need to get a-
_ read‘ on —— whether or not'we

can «intervene on the kind of
behavior students project to
the community.”

Harmon said the legality is
uncertain because students’
off—campus apartments are
considered their private homes.

_ Despite that, Pat Scanlon of the
South Oakland Citizen’.s
Council said she does believe
Pitt could potentially dismiss or
suspend their students who
live off campus.

“Pitt has their clever legal
beagles who can find a way to
legally get involved in off-cam-
pus situations and make the
kids act more responsibly,”
Scanlon said. “But they take

the stance that ‘If [the students]
are not on our campus, we’re
not responsible for them.” She
believes they take this stance
for financial reasons. .

“They’re not going to get rid
of any students —— that’s who
they get their money from,”
she said.

But the possibility of an
expansion of the university’s
jurisdiction grows more likely
as Harmon is meeting to dis-
cuss the new idea with repre-
sentatives from the Judicial
Board, Legal Counsel and
Student Development Monday.

“We have to concentrate on
developing a policy first and
then communicating to stu-
dents that this is what will hap-
pen, these are the potential
disciplinary actions that can be
taken whenever you circum-
vent the standards of behavior
that we have,” Harmon said.

Many students themselves
are likely to oppose the plan
as an invasion of their privacy
but Harmon said that increased
pressure from the community
is forcing the university to take
action.

“Students need to realize that
they are guests within the com-
munity. There are people who

move in they don’t have the
same kind of care and sensitiv-
ity in terms of property or

tremendous opportunity to
meet with some terrific alum-
ni. It’s been a great weekend

ward to a great rest of the
weekend.”

“I’m so impressed with the
students’ efforts to put on this
production, these fireworks
are just great,” Mary‘ Ann Aug,
director of Human Resources,
said.

After seeing the sky light

up, students listened to The,

Clarks, Pure Gold and
Stinging Rain in the \Y/illiam
Pitt Union.

Robert James, guitarist for
The Clarks, said the group
was happy to be playing at
Pitt. “It’s really nice to be
back, we haven’t played on
campus in a while.”

“I liked the fireworks and
laser show. I thought it. was
pretty awesome,” said Pitt
first-year student Brock
Nedierlander. “Because of
midterms, it’s a great time to
relax and have a good time.”

Homecoming King and Queen are
crowned, but some question process

Kelly B. Casey
Photography Editor

When Black Action Society
candidate Omari Daneils didn’t
hear his name called as this
year’s Homecoming king, he
lowered his head and shook it
in disappointment.

Later that night, Daneils’ dis-
appointment turned to anger
when he said he realized there
was no way, as an African-
American student, he could
have won.

“It’s not fair, we just can’t
win,” Daneils said.

He and another BAS member,
David Young, said that the
Homecoming king and queen
selection process, which was
enacted two years ago, made
the odds impossible for a
minority student to win.

They said that the former
election process was fairer for
minority students.

Under the old process,
Daneils said, as many.-as 12 to
15 candidates vied for students’
votes. But under the new
process, because only five can-
didates run, each candidate has
to get at least one—fifth of the
popular vote.

David Young said, “The num-
bers are with them and only
them,” referring to the white
student population. Todd Cable,
Pitt Program Council director of
Homecoming activities who ini-
tiated the new selection process,
said that the process was
changed because it would put
more meaning into event that
was only a “beauty contest.”

“The purpose of the change
was to pick candidates who
cared about the university and
who would do things as queen
and king to promote the

University of Pittsburgh,” Cable
said.

Cable added that the purpose
for the change was not to
decrease the number of

\‘ Homecoming candidates, but to

get more qualified candidates.
The changes included: raising
theoGPA requirement to a 2.5
and an interview process which
tested each candidates knowl-
edge of the university. The com-
mittee then chooses the five
candidates the student body will
vote for.

Daneils said that the changes
were initiated when two
African-American students were
crowned as king two years in a
row.

“I have a hard time believing
it was a coincidence. I personal-
ly think they did it on purpose,”
Daneils said about the PPC’s
decision to change the selection
process.

BAS President Marcus Guy,

said Daneils’ opinion “may be
valid,” but he said that the new
process does “decrease the pos-
sibility that a minority student
can become king or queen.”

Guy added that the changes
did not add value to the event
because it took away the deci-
sion of the student body and
gave it to a small committee. V

“I know their concern,” Cable

-said. He added that he made

sure the interviewing board had
at least 25 percent African-
American representation.

Cable said he could not
understand.why BAS is so con-
cerned about who is queen or
king, because it is a meaning-
less event.

“It really doesn’t mean much
of anything. It’s useless.’ We
only do it because its tradition.
Students don’t see it as anything

important,” Cable said.

Cable said that the new sys-
tem gave smaller campus orga-
nizations a better chance of get-
ting a candidate.

Natalie LaPaglia, president of
the band sorority Sigma Beta
Tau, said at first she agreed
with Cable that it gives students
from small organizations, like
hers with only 26 members, a
chance in getting their candidate
nominated. ,

But LaPaglia changed her
mind this year when she went
in front of the interview com-
mittee, which did not nominate
her.

She said the group was made
up of a BAS member,_ “two
sorority chicks” and a black pro-
fessor.

“It was unfair. Everyone but
myself who went in there knew
them. The idea was great, but
the- people who made up the
interviewing committee were
completely biased.”

LaPaglia said that although

students should have the final
say about who becomes their
queen and king, there should
be an unbiased panel who
chooses the court — a panel
who does not know any of the
student candidates.

Cable said maybe the only
way to resolve the controversy
around the event is to eliminate
it.

Daneils said that being king
can help African—American
issues.

“If we win, it shows black stu-
dents have a voice. I figure that
it will help black retention if
black students see a black
king,” he said minutes before
Tracy Clouse and Eric Farst
were crowned as this year’s
Homecoming king and queen.

programs initiated by the university to increase
the recruitment of African-American students and facul-
ty. . _
Both Guy and Cable agreed that BAS’ concerns could
have been better addressed during the Homecoming
planning stages. Guy also said that the administration is
“taking positive steps in the right direction.”

Guy said that part of the reason for the demonstration
was due to a lack of communication between BAS and
PPC. ‘

Cable added that “anyone from BAS could have come
and been on my Homecoming committee.”

Racism on campus

Mary Ellen Hiotakis, a third-year resident director of
Lothrop Hall, resigned on Oct. 2 over what she
described as a simple noise report being blown into a
racial issue. Although it was a resident assistant who
wrote the report, it was Hiotakis who was held account—
able by the students for racial insensitivity.

The accusations were made by residents of the ninth
ﬂoor who claimed they were unjustly accused of noise
violations because they were African American.
Hiotakis’ reason for resigning was simple. She claimed
that the Office of Residence Life didn’t support her View
concerning the noise incident. Members of the ORL suc-
cumbed toracial pressure, she said, by tearing up the
written noise report. ~ '

The issue here is very basic. To what length is the
University of Pittsburgh willing to go to fight racism?
The Black Action Society says not far enough. We agree.
But does fighting racism mean ignoring the problem
and ripping up reports in order to prevent a full—blown
incident? No, it does not. Hiotakis was treated unfairly,
so were the African—American students involved.
Support was necessary and it wasn’t available. The
problem needed to be confronted, and it was swept
under the rug.

Sweeping racist cries under the rug is nothing new.
This occurs even at the uppermost levels of university
bureaucracy.Chancellor O’Connor has done a‘ lot to
eliminate the red tape. But issues like this demand his
immediate attention. The size of the university often
prohibits things from reaching the upper levels where
they can be dealt with successfully.

Perhaps the ORL thought it was doing the university
and the students involved a favor. Perhaps it thought
that it was better to ignore the issue rather than confront
it. Regardless of the motives of ORL, there was a traves-

ty of justice involved here. ORL didn’t do anything

except take a very serious issue and hurt everyone
involved: African-American students, Mary Ellen
Hiotakis and the university student body as a whole.

No, racism isn’t going to end tomorrow. Nor will it
end in 50 years. But for a member of the administration,
to just out—and—-out ignore this problem by ripping up
the report is wrong. Was this an isolated incident? We
don’t know but believe it wasn’t. The problem'won’t go
away by ignoring it On the contrary, look at the
Rodney King incident. This incident was just the final
straw for the continuously ignored black community of
Los Angeles. The University of Pittsburgh should be
careful .and should heed this warning —— Stop ripping
up reports, and address the issue fairly.

This issue affects us all. It’s time for the university
administration to get involved.But let’s stop pointing the
finger. We should open our eyes and accept responsibil-
ity for our own actions. Don’t pass the blame.

A Clintonite praises President Bush

“rEL'e7_v man who can he a_/-i'7st-
rate something —- as every man
can he who is an-zan at all———
has no right to be or fifth-rate
something; for 62 ffth—mte some-
thing -is no better than 6lfi1St—7‘6lte
nothing. ”

j. G. Holland
“Plain ta]/es on_/cmzrfl-ictrsubjects’?

.Come November third, I will
shed a tear. While I, myself, am
voting for Governor Clinton ——
President Bush, one of the last of
a long line of great statesman,
will bid us adieu. He was part of
a tradition; a man who epito-
mized the ideals of the Grand
Old Party. A remnant of what the
Republican Party once was, he
will walk with the old Repub-
lican dinosaurs — Barry Gold-
water, Richard Nixon and
Dwight D. Eisenhower among
them.

Yes, the passing of George

Bush upsets me. Not only are we I

losing a man who served his
country well, we are seeing a
changing of the guard. Bush was
the final string which held his
party together -—- binding both
Moderates and Conservatives
into one. As evidenced by the
growth of the radical right and
pro—choice Republicans, his
finale breaks the string. Once the
party of less government and a
strong American military, the
party will be in a black hole
without Bush.

Just as the death of Bobby
Kennedy ushered in the dark
ages for the Democrats, the pass-
ing of George Bush could mean
the dark ages for the Repub-
licans. I am voting for Clinton
but not because I am voting
against Bush. No, I have come
here today —— like Brutus to
Caesar before me — to praise
Bush, not bury him.

I can understand the dissatis-
faction that many Americans
have with President Bush. The
criticism has come from every-
where — the media, Democrats
and members of his own party.

The backlash is not entirely

fair however. He is, quite simply,
regarded as a failure because he
is neither a Reaganite nor a
Liberal. It’s_ not because he was
such a bad president. Given
these circumstances then, his
ability to politically appeal to his
critics has been stifled. Rather,
the only thing he did “wrong”
was to try to provide a responsi-
ble R government.

,But you disagree with me.
You’re tired and want change.

Brett
Gilman

You tell me I’m blind: You tell
me to look at the economy. You
tell me to look at his social poli-
cy. I say if you want change
that’s fine. But don’t blame it all
on Bush. He did OK.

The most important issue this
year is the economy. Time and
time again we hear that Bush
has done nothing and that trick-
le-down economics has failed —
a kernel of accuracy if the truth
be told. However, in an interde-
pendent global economy, what
has he done wrong? Well, work-
er productivity has slipped rela-
tive to our major economic com-
petitors, japan and Germany.

Nonetheless, this recession is a
global‘ one, and our country is
dging better than most of the
richest nations. Most of the
forces behind this recession are
beyond the scope of our govern-
rnent’s short term control.
Uncertainty in Eastern Europe
and high interest rates in
Germany have nailed us. The
best thing Bush could have done
here, besides plead with the
Bundesbank, is nothing. Second-
ly, Bush’s appointment of Alan
Greenspan to a second term.as
chairman of the Federal Reserve
proves Bush’s commitment to
fighting inflation. Greenspan
made it perfectly clear that he

wasn’t going to help ‘Bush’s re—_,

election bid by sacrificing his
fight against inflation. Bush
knew full well it could cost him
the election. But his and Green-

span’s fight against inflation is
one of the things that could lead
us toward long—term recovery.
On trade, Bush has been one
of the best presidents in recent

history. His commitment to the -

important trade talks will expand
the U.S. market for food produc-
tion and save consumers $30 bil-

lion a year in lower food prices;

And by bringing Mexico into

uNA_FTA he has accomplished
‘much’. He will‘ not only in‘crease”
-trade and the standard of living
"for both Mexicans and Amer-

icans but will help promote
Democratic reforms for our
southern neighbors.

Finally, it is important to look
at Bush’s record on social issues.
Again he is attacked from all
sides. Take, for example, the
environment. He was criticized
by the right for signing into legis-
lation some of the toughest
environmental laws in the world
and ridiculed by the left for his
“do-nothingism” in Rio. Let’s
consider the later criticism. True,
environmental degradation is a
legitimate concern for us as well
as posterity. But what many
environmentalists failed to realize
is that given the economic situa-
tion, Bush had to consider the
interests of business. A healthy
economic household presuppos-
es a healthy environment. Bush
made a difficult and unpopular
decision. The economic situation
required it. Given a healthy eco-
nomic environment, I’m sure the
results would have been differ-
ent.

George Bush, you were an OK

president that went wrong when

you tried to play politics. On
November third, Iwill be solemn
— whether you win or lose. You
are among the last of the great
statesman. It has been a tough
time, and some would say let
you finish. But just like a great
pitcher who has overstayed his
days, your arm has gotten tired
—— you’ve wavered. And like
that great athlete, history will
treat you well George. You’ve
served your country.lIt’s time to
rest. '

Pitt football loses an ugly one toECU 37-31

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

Under normal circum-
stances, when 68 points are
totaled, you wouldn’t expect
to hear‘ coaches use words
like “so encouraged” and
“delighted” to describe their
defenses. ‘

Homecoming ‘92 was any-
thing but a normal game —
unless you’ve been a Pitt
football fan the last decade
— as Pitt suffered another
setback at the hands of East
Carolina, 57-51.

Saturday afternoon’s
“leaky” affair, touted as a
pinball aerial show, turned
into a frustrating, if not
fainiliar, script for the
Panthers, who found’ a way
to lose. This time by never
letting themselves in the
game. -

On a play East Carolina

head coach Steve Logan
later described as “too
cheap,” Billy,Davis, twisting
and turning for an extra
yard, fumbled the opening

.kickoff on his own 23 and

ﬂoated into the barren stadi-
um air.

But it wasn’t until a chip

‘expecting another gross
affair.

Soccer blows lead z'n2-2 tie zijith Syracuse

By Tom Schneider
Staﬂ‘ Writer

The Pitt soccer team held a
2-0 lead going into the second
half only to watch it dissolve

0 into a 2-2 overtime tie.

“When you’re up 2-0 at
home, you definitely want to
win,” Panther head coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “We made a
few mistakes in the second half

both teams had good
chances. We’revclisappointed to
come away with a tie — we
wanted to win.”

Pitt’s defense seemed to set
the tone in the first half; pro-
tecting its zone well against the
tough Syracuse attack. On
offense, midfielder Ted
Noethling came out of his scor-
ing slump to punch in both Pitt
goals in the first half.

Noethling started the scoring
just 5:03 into the game, taking
a pass from Scott Alexander on
the give—and-go beating
Syracuse goaltender Charlie
Wilkie for his third goal of the
season to give Pitt the early 1-0
lead. by

The Panthers’ defense kept
the Orangemen in check for
the next 25 minutes, until
Noethling got a chance to
increase the Panther lead.

At 29:35 into the half,
Noethling took a pass from
Dean, Astorino about 25 yards
out from the Syracuse net and

Dean Astorino set up Pitt's second goal late in the first half yesterday against Syracuse.

blasted a shot into the upper
left corner for his second goal
of the game.

“I needed to come out of [my
slumpl,” Noethling said. “I
haven’t been scoring as much
as I’d like to, and it felt good to
get a couple in today.”

Things looked well in hand
for Noethling and the Panthers
-as the first half drew to a close
with Pitt leading 2_-0. _ g

The early partlof the second

half was a scoreless struggle,
with both teams playing excel-
lent defense. Syracuse finally
got on the board at 20:41 into
the half on a goal by forward
Eric Puls. During a scramble
around the Panther goal,
Syracuse forward James
Shannon found an open Puls,
who beat Pitt goalie Adam
Spitzer down low to cut the
— Panther lead to 2-1.
Six minutes later, confusion

in the Pitt zone lead to the
tying goal.

Syracuse midfielder Anthony
Ramoon found defender
Richard Alexander about 25
yards from the Pitt goal and
Alexander shot it through a
crowd and into the net. The
score was tied at two with
18:55 remaining in regulation.

NBA hoops is a ‘Burgh thing — at least for one night

By Brian Gallagher
and Rob Pugliese
The Pitt News

NBA B-ball returns to the
‘Burgh.

The National Basketball
Association makes its annual
appearance at the Civic Arena
tonight when the Cleveland
Cavaliers meet the New Jersey
Nets in a preseason contest set
for a 7:30 p.m. tip—off.

Both clubs have high hopes
for the "92-’93 campaign. The
Cavs are coming off the finest
season in their history —— tying
a franchise mark by going 57-
25 and pushing the Chicago

Bulls to six games before
falling in the Eastern
Conference Finals.

The Nets have quickly risen
from also-rans to contenders in
the Eastern Conference. Jersey
went from 26 victories two sea-
sons ago to 40 wins last sea-
son.

The Cavs and Nets last met in
the first round of the 1992 NBA
Playoffs — with Cleveland pre-
vailing in four games.

Under the direction of head
coach Lenny Wilkens, the Cavs
are one of the most disciplined
offensive teams in the NBA —
led by guard MarkPrice, center
Brad Daugherty and forward

Larry Nance.

Sporting a deep supporting
cast that already includes John
“Hot Rod” Will-iams, Craig E1110
and Terrell Brandon, Cleveland
has re—cently been bolstered by
the off—season acquisitions of
off—guard Gerald Wilkins and
former Pitt star Jerome Lane.

The 6-foot—7—inch Wilkins —
signed as an unrestricted free
agent from the New York
Knicks —— gives Cleveland a
legitimate defender against
longtime Cavs’ nemesis,
Michael Jordan. The Lane pick-
up is a risk—free proposition —
he’ll either by a cost efficient
rebounder/spot defender for

his hometown team or he’ll be
cut.

With Chuck Daly taking the
reins from Bill Fitch, New
Jersey anticipates another
quantum leap this season.

The Fitch era was so full of

‘tension and so devoid of

respect that, at times, this out-
spoken and undisciplined
bunch literally refused to play.
Bookend bad boys Derrick
Coleman and Chris Morris
caused a late-season uprising
that should have kept the Nets
from postseason.

The mere fact that it did not
is evidence of how talented this
club is. Built around power for-

11

ward Coleman and brash off
guard Diazen Petrovic, the Nets
shocked observers around the
league by finishing seventh in
the East.

With Daly at the helm, point
guard Kenny Anderson has the
opportunity to evolve from
troubled rookie to sophomore
sensation.

Look for Anderson to grab
more mimites while Mookie
Blaylock gets phased gradually
into a support role.

For New Jersey to reach the
next level, Daly must harness
Andersorfs limitless potential
and continue to milk valuable

don’t do well, we look
bad.”

Other factors that hurt
Pitt’s chances at the meet

has kept No. 2 runner
Laura O’Donnell out of
the lineup allseason, and
the recent injury to top
runner Carmela Mariani,
who suffered a stress frac-
ture in her leg.

The two senior captains

were expected‘ to be
Pitt’s best runners this
year.

First-year student Tonia
Malloy led Pitt’s runners
with a time of 20:00, good
for a 45th—place finish.

Another first-year stu-
dent, Melanie Ishman, fol-
lowed Malloy with a 60th-
place finish and a time
of 21:00. Rounding out
Pitt’s top five were senior
captain Judy Facey
(61st place, 21:07), first-
year student Natasha
Van Riel (66th place,
21:24) and first-year stu-
dent Ayne Allen (73rd,

more Katina Miles (76th

Lewis said that he con-
siders it a positive devel-
opment that four of Pitt’s
top five runners were first-
year students.

‘‘It’s a very good sign,”
Lewis said. “Our number

straight points to the Rams.

But Lucanie again seized
control of this Pitt tailspin.
With a tremendous back-row
kill and a great solo block,
Lucanie enabled the up—and-
down Panthers to win, 15-11.

“The serving was the key,”
Woodstra said about the
Rhode Island match. “It was
just two young teams figur-
ing out how to play.” 9

While Pitt and Rhode
Island were figuring out
how to play, Loyola-Chicago
was waiting for its Sunday
showdown with the Panthers.
The monster was waiting,
too.

In game one, Pitt battled a
tough-serving Loyola team to
take an 8-3 lead. Mikla
harassed the Ramblers with a
combination of middle
spikes.

Lucanie paced Pitt with
some nice “spot” kills and
then turned the heat on with
some vicious spikes to keep
the Panthers in front.

But Loyola fought back and
Pitt broke down. After play-
ing solidly in the early part
of game one, Pitt was forced
to take a time-out when the
Ramblers took the lead 10-9.

Instead of regrouping after
the break, Pitt continued to
falter and Loyola continued
on its" winning ways. Led by

the solid setting of senior

Julie Mcshane, the Ramblers
rambled on to victory, 15-9.
The monster had struck.

The Panthers, with better
blocking, fought back to lead
10-6 in the second game.
Pitts middle hitter Alyssia

Yanik showed her offensive '

skills in the Panthers’
offense. Pitt’s breath of new
life not only tied the match
but also blew out Loyola, 15-
6.

The Ramblers learned a
lesson from the game two
blow-out and grabbed a 7-2
advantage over an again
slumping Pitt team. The
Panthers had three hitting
errors early and never recov-
ered. -

Pitt’s 28 hitting errors and
14 service errors during the
match allowed Loyola to
keep the pressure on.
Rambler setter McShane’s soft
hands allowed Loyola to
spike anywhere, anytime and
at will. Coupled with Panther
errors, Loyola won easily 15-
7 and led two games to one.
The. monster was having a
feast.

In a match of who can be
more inconsistent, game four
was no different. Back—and—
forth mistakes allowed Pitt to
go up 7-3. .

The trend continued as
both teams staggered to a 7-7

tough at times, Pitt led 12-7.
Again the inconsistency mon-
ster snappecl at the Panthers,
and Loyola went up 13-12.

But the Ramblers also
made mistakes, and Pittran
off three straight points to
win a sloppy game four at
15-13. Lucanie sent the“
match into the final rally-
point game with an ace to ‘
end game four.

Feeling the pressure in
game five, the Panthers did
not respond. Pitt had two
key service errors and coin-
mitted four hitting errors in
the final game. Loyola had a
couple of crucial blocks by
Therese O’Neill, but Pitt had
beaten itself 15-11.

Losing the two-hour-long
match three games to two,
the monster was stronger
than ever.

“So much depends on how
we play,” Woodstra said. “It’s
not what we’re doing to stop
them, it is what we’re doing
to stop ourselves.”

‘‘[It is] inconsistency at the
wrong time,” Woodstra said
of her team’s 10-10 record.

“People who waver in
confidence affects the team,
and we don’t have the
depth to make many adjust-
ments.” ‘

The monster continues to
grow.

Interest and intensity

Flanker Billy Davis,

Men's XC

Continued from page 9

Waddle Freeman.

“Arkansas [of the SEC] is the
best team in the country, but
no other conference has the
number of good teams as the
Big East does.”

“These teams [Providence
and Villanova] will be in
the hunt for the national title
just proving how tough our
conference is,” said senior co-
captain Tom Swartout.

“We didn’t run poorly. We

ran into some very good com-
petition,” Lear said.

“This was a good team meet
for us. We had six guys with-
in 33 seconds of each other.
Our three, four and five run-
ners ran better than last year.”

The strong teams all run-
ning against each other pro-
duced a very fast start. For
the first two miles, Freeman
was running with the top five
runners, but soon after
the ‘two—mile mark, the
pack broke into a single line
where runners started passing
him.

“My goal was to run with
the front runners. On this day
they were just better,”
Freeman said.

“This was my last Big East

Championships, and I just
wanted to do my best. I won’t
second guess myself.”

Freeman finished 20th with
a time of 24:56 — his best
time of the year.

Despite the time, Freemen
felt he had only an “average”
race and feels partly responsi-
ble for the team’s finish.

“The other guys were run-
ning off me, and I wasn’t able
to keep up [with the lead-
ersl,” Freeman said.

Sophomore, Frank Nesko
had problems with the fast

start as well. ,

“I got out fast but just
couldn’t hold it,” Nesko
said

Nesko finished 23rd with a
time of 25:12, an improve-
ment from last year’s 31st-
place showing.

_“We weren’t intimidated by
them [Providence and
Villanoval,” Swartout said.

“We went right after them,
we didn’t sit back and wait
for something to happen 
we went after them and came

up a little short. Our young

guys aren’t used to that type

‘of fast start.”

Swartout finished 26th with
a time of 25:17.
