In Politics--Swilley

Graylyn Swilley

BY BILL HADUCK

Seeing a need for more partici-
pation on the part of black students
in politically relevant’ campus
activities, Graylyn Swilley opened
her campaign for Chairman of
Black Action Society (BAS).

“My overall objective,” she
said, “is to actively engage a
broader cross-section of the black
student population in activities

- such as the Black Action Society

and then from there, once we get
the population involved, we can go
about initiating all of the programs
we have.”

Swilley, who is running on a slate
with Deputy Chairman Candidate
Steve Daniel, said the need for
getting students involved is appar-
ent when it ‘is understood “the

BAS Head Kilson
Running Again

BY BILL HADUCK and
RITA VITOL0

Making a bid for re-election,
Black Action Society (BAS) Chair-
man Bill Kllson said his campaign
will be run without the usual
“campaign promises.” ‘
“Last year, when I campaigned, I
did have a platform,” he said. “ I
had a lot of good ideas, I said a lot
of things, but when I got in office, I
found there were already a lot'of
things for me to do, just basic
things as far as structure. We just
didn‘t have the people to get
everything done we wanted to dq.
So if I said I have a platform, it‘d be
just like making campaign pro-
mises and I don‘ want to do that.”

Rather than a political platform
Kilson proposes a policy of
reckoning with problems in a
realistic manner. “A lot of political
developments we wanted have
been achieved," he said. '

“The problem is, what do we do
now? We‘re in a situation where
we don‘t know quite where to go. I

problem.

programs out that are interesting.
Politically, we face a bigger

‘Two sides of same coin’

House Views Reform Bill -

By, Pitt Student Group

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

A Pennsylvania House sub-com-
mittee heard testimony at Pitt
Friday concerning an election bill
written by a Pitt political science
class instructed by Lee Weinberg
then an assistant professor.

“I was teaching a course in
legislative process (at Pitt Johns-
town)," Weinberg said, “I was
trying to find a more stimulating
way to teach the course, and
instead of telling students about
the operation was actually involv-
ing them in it.”

Weinberg commented there was
wide-spread interest in, the bill
among members of the State
House, especially with the current
problems’ in national politics.

“There seems to be a growing
interest, in the wake of Water-
gate,” said. Weinberg, “in putting
strict regulations on the flow of
money.”

According to Weinberg, the

Ellsberg ComparesiWatergate, Vietnam

BY DAVE MAJ ERNIK

The Watergate scandal and the
Vietnamese War are two sides .of
the same coin claimed the revealer
of The Pentagon Papers, Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg, in a speech last week in
Pittsburgh.

“The lessons of The Pentagon
Papers are the lessons of Water-
gate,” said Ellsberg. “Although
the Vietnam War had a far greater
lethal effect than Watergate, it was
no less illegal than Watergate.”

The soft-spoken, slim, gray-
haired researcher’ who worked
under three Presidents as a

Speaking at

Robert Welch, founder’ and
director of the John Birch Society,
will speak at Pitt’s David Lawrence
Hall Monday at 8:30 pm.
Admission is free.

Welch was born December 1, 1899

on a farm in North Carolina. His
ancestry is full of farmers and
Baptist preachers traceable to

Miles Welch. who came to this
country in 1720.
He was educated for four years at

» the University of North Carolina

(enrolled at the age twelve and
graduated at sixteen), the United

Pitt Tonight

States Naval Academy (2 years),
Harvard Law School (2 years), and
the school of hard knocks (about
forty years).

During the mid-thirties, he
became greatly disturbed about the
direction in which our Nation was
headed. His concern was deep
enough that he wrote an un-
published article entitled A Weight
On My Shoulders. In this article he
stated: “The glory that is passing
in the America that l was born in;

strategic analyst for the Rand
Corporation explained that the
source of both problems is an
unchecked executive oranch of
government which has been
withholding information from the
American people. I '

According to Ellsberg, recent
Presidents ..have lied to the
American people and disregarded
the Constitution when dealing with
the Vietnam War.

“In 1964, Lyndon Johnson
carried out the exact policies in
Vietnam which his opponent,
Senator Goldwater, had held
during the election. During the
past four years, Kissinger and
Nixon have been the two people
most responsible for our policy in
Vietnam which has resulted in over
four and a half million tons of
bombs being dropped,” he said.

Ellsberg, who worked on the
study of the 25-year history of the
Vietnam War (later to be known as
The Pentagon Papers) for the then
Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara, said when he first read
the report he could see that the
President was a major part of the
problem.

“The war in Vietnam has been
going on for 29 years,” he said,
“and it’s been our war all along. I
still think it can go on for another
29 years if we ,don't learn more ,

than what ‘l’ve' learned about it.” ' ‘T

Describing his work for the
White House, Ellsberg admitted
his own guilt. “In those days when

I worked in the executive branch, I
never knew’ the Constitution. I
didn’t think it applied to me. My
loyalty to the three presidents I
served under was similar to that of
the Watergate defendants. The
President’s word was law,” he
said. '

In 1969, Ellsberg had a change of
heart and turned over the Pentagon
Papers report to the Senate Foreign
Relations committee which did not
act. Two years later, he handed it
over to The New York Times.

‘‘I wanted to warn the people
that we have an outlaw executive
branch,” he explained. “But'

major points of the bill revolve

around strict report and disclosure
of the source of donations, limits to
contributions and total expenditure
and tax credits to the people

making donations to the candidate’

of their choice.

Weinberg had a feeling of.

support for the bill from all levels of
the state government, noting this

kind of "legislative action was"

necessary for the rebuilding7of
American faith in government.

“Some resistance,” Weinberg
said, “comes from people who
want even stronger limitations in
elections. I would rather see
something done step by step,
setting precedents. Some people
claim since it’s not easily enforce-
able, it’s not worth the effort.”

Weinberg accented the results of
a good application of the‘ tax credits
scheme, which he thought would
cure the current feeling of
alienation from the sources of
political power.

In his statement to the sub-c6m- . J

mittee, Weinberg said, “Just as
there is a negative and destructive
effect when people believe that a
few ‘fat cats’ own the politicians,
there. will. be a positive and

constructive effect when voters see j

that they are the primary source‘ of
ﬁnancial support for their public
officials.

“In the long run, the speciﬁc - ~
t emphasis on- the contributions to
the political parties will hopefully

lead to the strengthening of the
parties so that they will be able to

offer the voters realalternatives in

public policy.”

The tax credit scheme would
encourage the regular voter ‘to
make contributions, and would
provide a tax credit of up to $25 for
the donations, according to Wein-
berg. “The idea is to broaden the
base of political involvement, we
need more small contributions and
fewer large contributions. One of
the campaign limits would restrict
contributions to within five percent
of the total allowed spending.”

“One point would prohibit
contributions from contractors who
have business with the state, you

can understand this in the view of _

the Agnew thing.”

In a prepared statement before‘ V

the sub-committee Friday, Wein-
berg cited the limitations on
contributions as critical to the
establishment of a generation of
politicians free from economic ties
to special interests.

“The proposed limit on the
amount any single contributor may

.  donate toacandidate is designed to . g ._
' " reduce’ the dependance of» the _  ‘=

candidates on any single large
contributor,” Weinberg said.

done.” When asked if he would
have done it over again, Ellsberg
replied: “Certainly. I’m only sorry
that I didn’t do it sooner.”

The purpose of the secrecy
system of classifying government
documents is mainly to conceal
information embarrassing to the
Administration, Ellsberg said. He
admitted there is some information
which really should be classiﬁed,
but maintained the other branches
of government should share with
the executive branch the responsi-
bility of deciding what is to be
classiﬁed.

“The current impeachment pro-
ceedings show how difficult it is for
Congress and the American people
to get information from the
President,” he said. “That’s what
happens when you give the
Executive Branch sole right to
discriminate what’s to be classi-
fied.”

Ellsberg said he was the first
person to ever be prosecuted for a
news leak. “At ﬁrst I thought that
I had violated the law and would
spend the rest of my life in jail,” he
said. “But there’s no law to cover
what I had done. The classification
system is just an administrative
system, and people are tired or
transferred for violating these
rules.

“The reason why there’s no law

against news leaks is because the g

Congress and the courts have
always felt it would be a violation of
the First Amendment [of freedom
of speech]. So I was charged
instead for the violation of the
espionage acts.”

Ellsberg pointed out that the
government's espionage charges
against him (of which he was later
acquitted) were unfounded since he
had never given any information to
an enemy agent unless the White
House considered the American
people enemies.

He also noted the recently
revealed theft of -documents by the
Pentagon from Henry Kissinger’s
office was exactly the same act he
had done, and yet no one had been
prosecuted in that instance.

“News leaks are not unusual,
they come out all the time,” said
Ellsberg. “In fact, The Pentagon
Papers are not the largest news
leak. Volumes of memoirs written
by retired statesmen, which are in
essence news leaks, have been
published containing much more
classified information than The
Pentagon Papers.”

The Harvard-educated econo-
mist said the bungled break-in of
his psychiatrist’s office would have
revealed no damaging information
about himself since he had nothing
to hide.

“The same [Cuban-American]
individuals, who bungled the Bay
of Pigs operation and bungled the
Watergate break-in, performed at
the same level of competence
during the break-in at my
psychiatrist’s...With men like this
in charge of the Bay of Pigs
invasion, no wonder Castro is still
in power in Cuba.”

According to Ellsberg, the
Watergate scandal may have at
least temporarily averted an
executive coup. “I hope the people
realize that the type of government
we now have is like a monarchy,”
he said. “Congress is beginning to
act.

“_Only if the public gives the
message to Congress that it doesn’t
want to be lied to anymore will
Congress continue to act. But good
things are happening. I believe
that this President will be
impeached and convicted. I was
also impressed by how well this
system worked in my own trial.

“The government established
200 years ‘ago does not automati-
cally sustain itself. The checks and
balances of our government are
useful but not guaranteed. We can
preserve our democracy only by
arming ourselves with knowledge.

“Then we can make the
forthcoming bicentennial a true
celebration of democracy rather
than a betrayal of the American

Revolution, as planned by this
Administration.”

Ellsberg’s speech at North Hills
High School Auditorium sponsored

by the La Roche College Commun-
ity Cultural Committee was part of
a national speaking tour to raise
funds to pay the costs incurred
from his trial.

more subtle.

“In the past we didn‘t have to
look that deeply because they were
obvious. The kind of problems that
black students face now, really lie
in what kind of education they
receive, and what kind of people
that education will make them.”

Kilson said the present edu-
cational system puts black students
through unnecessary courses and
conditioning. ,

“I think black people in general
live in different conditions than
white people. And because’ we live
in a kind of oppressed condition,
we need to learn some different
things in order to change the
conditi_ons in which we live. Ithink
the political moves we have to
make next are in education. This
isn‘ta very sensational thing, but I
think BAS is going to have to move

in that direction.”

Kilson also advocates the ABC--
no entry proposal for the University

in which failing grades would not
be entered on transcripts.

“I think achievement should just
be measured in positive terms. If
you don‘t have to worry about
being punished for making mis-
takes, you can learn better.”

Kilson felt he couldn‘t measure
the inﬂuence BAS might have in
the acceptance of the proposal, but
said, “I just think we have to
expand and begin to deal with our
own curriculm.”

Concerning BAS‘s contact with
students, Kilson felt “it‘s gotten

much better over the past few.
It‘s getting better and it “ i
could get even more so.”

years.

» Reviewing his past year as
chairman of the organization
Kilson said, “BAS is a big job. It
took me a long time to learn all the
ropes well. " He felt his experience
would be an asset to next year‘s
BAS. “The continuity would be
good,“ he said.

 Health Center Offers
  iiiOver—al/ Family Planning

BY DEBBIE POPP

Contraception--with a more com-
prehensive approach--is the dictum
of the Family Planning Program
initiated two months ago at the
Student Health Service.

Over 200 individuals, two per cent
of whom are males, have become
participants in this program. At"
$20 a year the participant is

, entitled to individual and/ or group
” counseling, a battery of laboratory

tests, gynecological exams, and a
contraceptive device of her choice.

“The fee.is necessary because the
program comes under the elective
heading. It is not illness-oriented
and hence not covered by insu-
rance,” explained Dr. Joanne
Robinson, Director of Student
Health Services.

Robinson added, “Students would
ﬁnd it hard to get a comparable
program at this price.”

To demonstrate that $20 is a small
fee for services rendered, she
pointed out if a patient is taking

. oral contraceptives, the cost of the

'pill for a year would exceed $24.

“On that alone, the service more
than pays for itself,” Robinson
said. I

The original cost covers any
number of necessary visits to the
doctor during the year and all

complications of the chosen contra-

tion. This includes any switch in

' I was admitted to this school
shortly after a long puberty. My
intentions were of the intellectual
variety, that _is, to ingest the
 I regested words of the resident
 scholars. I had hoped to someday
go to medical school and perhaps,
in the future, buy my own lake to
walk across. As fate would have it,
i (or the Dean wou1dn’t), a strange
phenomenon happened on the day
of my interview...as foretold by the
Cathedral scribes. A strange
illuminating vibrancy was seen
shooting across the horizon‘. My
advisor claimed it to be a signal of
the Messiah. This he said was
promised at the last faculty
meeting. However, I knew
intuitively that by metaphysical
definition, the Messiah was not
likely to stop in Allegheny County,
(at least not until the County Fair).
I attributed the light as possibly
belonging to a shooting star or a
'dental student with an aluminum
overbite. Unfortunately, the Dean
took the light as an omen: A Dies
Irae, if you will, and I was denied
admission. I tell you all this for no
specific reason but to explain the
events leading up to my being in

did so. She then asked me if I
wanted a cheap ~ buy on an
expensive watch. I became utterly
speechless when she opened her
coat and there in the lining was the
largest collection of Bulovas and
Omegas this side of Binstocks. I
remarked. that I wasn't in the
market for the time piece and went
on.

By accident I wandered into a
room which I later found to be off
limits to students and other
check-bearing mutants. There I

saw a strange looking four foot V

gnome [a nonunion elf] stamping
+70% on the faculty book request
list for next term. This puzzled me
and I began to interrupt him when
he turned on his heels and held a
crucifix to my face. While I was
genuflecting he made good his
escape.

Going downstairs into the Halls
of Scripture I began to look for the
bookstore's book of books--the
coiled collections of well intentions
and the memories of a thousand
lectures--a notebook. It was here
that I discovered a shelf that was
chained but mistakenly left un-

, locked. What I uncovered has (and

will) shocked me and you I'm Sllrr...

There on the black shelves sat a
secret collection of books and ﬁlm
loops used by the Campus Red
Guard as seminar material for
meter-maids. I saw infamous
copies of Writing Violations Si-

Taggings; A Pictured Atlas of
Guerrilla Attacks on the Public

Letters to the Editor

Garbage

Editor:
Criticizing Pitt columnist George
Zrust is like throwing mud at a pig

' or garbage at a rat; all three
animals in fact thrive on it. Zrust
possesses that unique literary

capability of taking some inane
boring subject such as the junkmail
he receives and making.it even
more boring. He is also great at
enlightening the readership with
such perceptive revelations as the
fact that paper is very abundant
and important at a university for
records, books, information etc.

I Why. he must have spent halfa day

outside his cave to come up with
something so profound.

Another of his equally interes-
ting colunms had to do with how
some strangers had done some-
thing nice for him a couple of days
in a row. Well if his writing is any
reflection on his personality, I
could have told him long ago that it
could only be someone who didn’t
know him that would do something
nice for him.

His greatest work of late
however was when he derided
someone on campus who had

It   Pitt Book Gen ter: The Pro fit

bound symposium on “Calling Tow
Trucks after Six pm" They even
had ﬁlm loops on the various
phases of Anne Frank's arrest. My
expression of disgust must have
sounded an alarm because I was
immediately attacked by the ladies
of the sidewalk. The next thing I
recall was being forced to plead
guilty and mailing myself with two
dollars to the House of Misde-
meanors. Shortly thereafter I made
an escape and have been under-
ground since.

expressed hatred towards him even

though they said that they didn’t,

even know him. His light-hearted
putdown was unexpected on my
part, but then I concluded that
many years of such criticism had
made him ‘callous to such people,
and in fact, a creative verbal
rebuttal on his part would have ~
been tantamount to squeezing

I brains out of the proverbial turnip.

Let it be known however that
my primary objection stems not
from a revulsion to his ability per
se. but only from the fact that he is
given space in a paper which a
stranger may pick up and tragically
stumble on to his article. People
within the Pitt community realize
the possibility that his father may
own the printing press of the
newspaper and as such may make
excuses to the effect that his
column is for the little brothers and
sisters of Pitt students, sort of a
kidee section. Think what would
result should an alumnus or
administrator from another univer-
sity get hold of a paper and infer
that his abilities are representative
of all the students at Pitt. His
column is admittedly devoid of any
salient sensitive political topics
which could incite controversy; but
the academic community expects
something more entertaining or
provocative than his dislike for
paper or disconcern with criticism.

I’ve tried to tell friends that his
column is a front for the work of
literary aspirants at the Western

Psych writing workshop; but his,
remarkably consistent subterran-

ean performance obviates that
possibility. I would only hope that
in the future he would find that
small niche in the great wall of life
consistent with his level of literary
expertise, such as the unzipped
mail sorter at the post office. Like
Nixon, I probably can’t knock him
out of office, but I’ll sure as hell try
and make it miserable for him
while he’s there. My dullest
nocturnal fantasy is infinitely more
interesting than his incessant
literarv defecation, which is de-

meaning to all those who would call
the Pitt News an ‘exercise in
collegiate journalism.

But to prove that I am not totally
obsessed with gloom, I will end
with a bright note and a happy
prediction; because any sap that
writes as bad as he does and
thrives on criticism is blessed with
a life of eternal satisfaction.

inaccuracies

Editor:

Upon returning from my vaca-
tion, I discovered to my dismay that
an article written by Mr. Carl
Uhl_man on Sexual Counseling
which appeared in The Pitt News,
Wednesday. March 6, 1974 and
based on an interview the reporter
had with me contains a number of
inaccurate quotations. In partic-
ular, -I would like to refute the
comments allegedly made by me
comparing psychoanalytic psycho-
therapy to sexual counseling.

As I explained to Mr. Uhlman,  ”

the sexual counseling service is a
division of the family psychiatry
clinic at the Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic. It is geared to
assist couples with circumscribed
sexual problems. Individuals
requiring this service are carefully
screened and those who require
psychotherapy for a long standing
or severe emotional problem are
treated in the family therapy clinic
or referred to individual or group
psychotherapy depending on their
needs. Clearly, sexual counseling
is not an alternative to any other
type of psychotherapy.

In my interview with Mr.
Uhlman, who incidentally said that
he was writing for a journalism
class, psychoanalysis was never
discussed. What I did say was that
psychotherapy was an alternative
and a traditionally accepted ap-
proach for the treatment of sexual
problems but a_s the goals of
conventional psychotherapy are far.
more encompassing, it undoubt-
edly is a much more
process. I appreciate your
willingness to print this brief note.
Sincerely yours.

Clinic

“This generation is a generation
that has to get high. Be it drugs,
drinking or sex they gotta get
high," Todd Rundgren pulls his
hair-out of his face,_ wiping away
the trace of a three hour show and
faces the hungry reporters.
“People like our parents taught to
us we had to gethigh with all their
drugs and booze,’ but we got
something more--we’ve ‘got our
energies. .

“Our parents are hung up on this

It was like acid flashes...the way
he did it and explained it. His
conception of what video could

his show is. With the band,

The notes under the jacket photo
are:

“This is Grace Paley looking

Karl Bissinger’s house, among his

has been a typist, a housewife, and

it.”

Grace .Paley's ‘new book, her

17 short stories. It is similar to her

These stories were published
over the last fourteen years in

-periodicals ranging from The

Atlantic and Esquire to Ararat and
The Noble Savage.
Told mostly in the first person,

they capture the vernacular of city '

dwellers. The fates of Paley's
characters are described with
warmth, humor and sympathy.
Characters from her first book
reappear and many of the stories in
Enormous Changes at ‘the Last
Minute are interrelated; minor
characters in one story are the
central characters of another.

“Distance" relates the same
situations as “An Interest in Life"
in the earlier volume. The married
son of an apartment dweller carries
on an affair with one of his
mother's young neighbors. The
earlier story was told by the young
neighbor, the, mother of- several
children, whose husband had run
off with another woman.

The present story is told by the
mother; her son had originally

wanted to marry the neighbor but

the mother had objected. He
married another woman and now_
visits his first love twice a week.
Old Mrs. Rafteryis resigned to the
situation. “She doesn’t- like her

another neighbor of Mrs. Raftery.
Faith was also the central character
in “A Subject of Childhood” in the
earlier collection. Deserted by her
husband, Faith raises her two

Tomorrow At Sewickley

    Pitt, Indiana Matched ,

In Hockey Semifinals

BY BART MACK
Sports Editor

For the third time in the
history of ‘the Western. Pa.
Intercollegiate Hockey Association,
The Pitt Hockey Club will be
entering post season play as the
favorite to retain the Commis-

sioners Cup that has been in its
possession since 1972. The
Panther skaters will take the ﬁrst
step in defense of their crown
tomorrow, 7 pm at the Sewickly Ice
Arena against third place ﬁnishers
Indiana University of Pennsyl-
vania. .

At 9 pm on the Sewickly Arena
ice, second place Carnegie-Mellon
will face fourth place Duquesne for
the right to compete in the ﬁnals on
Thursday night at the Civic Arena.
’ The stiff battle for that ﬁnal
berth in the playoffs went down to
the ﬁnal game of the regular
season but the Duquesne Dukes
were determined to match their
City rivals by dousing the hopes of
St. Vincent, 6-3, on the loser’s
home ice. C-MU will still be the
choice to down the Dukes but the
Tartans will not be facing any
patsy. Duquesne gave C-MU some
trouble over the regular season,
losing to Mellon in the closing
minutes once, 4-3.

Last night Pitt warmed up for the
playoffs by edging Penn State
[Main Campus], 4-3, in what was
one of the most physically brutal
games of the season. Rick Vernon
had the hat trick for the Panthers
but spent the last five minutes, off
and on, in the penalty box.

_netminder Mark Lieberman.

Vernon retaliated to a stick
‘across the neck from one PSU
skater, dropping his stick and
throwing punches. Vernon drew a
ﬁve minute ﬁghting major but left
the penalty box with about a
minute to play when captain Denny
Browne squared off an opponent in
front of the Pitt net, attracting a
crowd. '

Goalie Paul Shemansky kept the
Nittany Lions off the score board in
the first period with stops mainly
on long drives but Penn State
spoiled the early return of
Pitt
led PSU 4-1 through most of the
third period but received a scare
when State put a pair of goals past
Jumpin’ John DeFazio in the last
two minutes of the game. Denny
Browne had a lone tally for Pitt.

The Pitt Hockey Club will be
sponsoring a student bus for each
of the playoff games, tomorrow and
Thursday nights. For tomorrow’s
game against Indiana, the bus will
depart from the Fifth Avenue side

-of the Student Union at 6:00 pm for

the contest at Sewickley. Times for
Thursday’s game will be an-
nounced in Wednesday’s Pitt
News.

Raleigh, N.C.--Emotionally
sparked by the near-fatal injury to
superstar David Thompson, North
Carolina State roared to a 100-72
victory over Pitt Saturday to win

the Eastern Regional NCAA
Championship. K The Wolfpack
meets UCLA this Saturday at

Greensboro, N.C. in a National
Championship semi-ﬁnal game.

A consensus All-American, the
6-4 Thompson possesses an extra-
ordinary leaping ability. While
attempting to block a Lew Hill jump
shot, Thompson’s feet collided with
6-8 teammate Phil Spence’s shoul-
dérs, ﬂipping Thompson over
backward, causing him to land on
his head. He came very close to
breaking his neck. .but he escaped
with minor injuries, and is
expected to play Saturday.

Hill's shot did not go in, but Keith
Starr got the rebound and scored
before play was halted to aid
Thompson.

Pitt cut the lead to three at that
point, 24-21, and Billy Knight’s
spectacular under-hand layup cut
the Wolfpack margin to one.

Thompson was taken to a hospital
after being wheeled off the floor on
a stretcher. After the initial shock,
“Win it for David” became the
State rallying force.

Sparked by the shooting of 7-4
Tom Burleson and 5-5 Monte
Towe, the Wolfpack built up a lead
that reached 12 points.

The Panthers began shooting hot
though, and fought back to cut the
lead to 47-41 at the half.

The Wolfpack received a message
from Thompson that he was

allright, and they came out
storming in the second half.

.The Panthers shot an excellent
50% from the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst half,
but cooled off to 32.5% in the
second.

With State dominating the boards ‘

at both ends of the floor, the Cats
were almost helpless as they
watched the Wolfpack build up an
insurmountable lead.

The ﬁnal rebounding statistics
told the story. Led by Spence’s 14
and Burleson’s 12, N.C. State
outrebounded Pitt, 49-26.

“We had to continue hitting the
short jumper in order to win," said
Pitt coach Buzz Ridl after the
game. “Opportunities came to us
but we didn't take advantage of
them."

»“We have played better." he
add,ed.“Our choice of shots in the
second half wasn’t good." .

Visibly shaken by the Thompson
injury, Wolfpack coach Norm_Sloan
had little to say about the game.
‘‘It doesn’t mean anything to us,”
he said. “Pm just relieved because
of the status of David.”

Sloan agreed that rebounding was
the key to the game. “There were

Swiirimers Best In
Last 15 Years

BY YAIER LEHRER
The Pitt Swim team ended up
with their best season in ﬁfteen
years, ﬁnishing with a 7-3 record
and a tenth place in the Easterns,

their best finish ever in that
championship meet. This all
freshman-and-sophomore team

(except for senior diver‘ Martin
Staley) has really proven itselfto be
a quality team and Bradshaw is
"very optimistic about the future of
his program.

“Our goal is to be one of the best
in the country," Coach Dick‘

Bradshaw said. “We broke an
uncountable number of records this
year. and we'll probably improve

on that when next season rolls.

along."

Bradshaw has been rebuilding
since arriving at Pitt and in the past
few years has brought the team
from the depths of mediocrity to its
present status, undoubtedly a
much better one. The recruiting

program has brought such swim-

some really good swimmers on the
team, but we need more, especially
in the free-style events and» the
individual medley.”

Bradshaw wants to recruit more
free-stylers, but he has one
problem. It's called money. Right
now there are only four scholar-
ships to be had among thirty
swimmers.

“I’d like to be able to get the
swimmers from this area to stay

here, but you can’t do that without '

money and four scholarships is not

Linemen Top Recruit Crop

Johnny Majors has never made
any bones about it. The X and Os
always move a whole lot better, he
says, when you have good athletes.

If you don't recruit well, you can’t
win in major college football.

Johnny Majors ought to be
sleeping sounder these days. Pitt’s
1973 National Coach-of-the-Year
announced today the results of the
recently completed recruiting cam-
paign, and most importantly, hé
says he's» pleased.

Majors and his young staff have
signed 25 athletes to grants-in-aid
and are expecting to add one or two
more in the next several weeks.
Included in the group are seven
junior college players who could
give the Panthers some immediate
help next season. Under the new
NCAA rules, all schools are limited
to a maximum of 30 grants-in-aid in
one year. - '

“I'm very pleased with the
response we received this year,”
Majors said in announcing his
recruits. “I think we had a very
good recruiting year. We built a
foundation last year, and I'm
hopeful this group will give us
another ﬂoor in the building. Of
course, we won't know the true
results until four years from now.”

Majors noted there was some
emphasis on recruiting linemen.
Pitt landed some muscle up front
with a high total of 10 interior
linemen who weigh 230 pounds or
better. Only four running backs
were recruited.

“Although in general we were
looking for outstanding athletes,
we did put some emphasis on
linemen,” he said. “We had a
number of senior linemen grad-
uate, and we're looking for some
immediate help" in this area.
Overall, I’m very, pleased.”
