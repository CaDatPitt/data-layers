Ex Colonel Blasts Army Atrocities

_ for

  

Herbert Predicts Police State

byROBOBENREDER

.“A preview of a brave new
world" was how Anthony Herbert,
former Armyrlieutenant colonel,
described the'Uni»ted States‘ ac-
tion in the View Nam war at Dav-
id Lawrence Hall Monday night.
Herbert described Viet Nam as
"the cause of nothing—it is the

symptom” of what is happening _

in America.

Herbert predicted a "stab in
the back theory" by the military.
"The Army is upset because of
their loss in-Viet Nam and is look-

ing for a scapegoat.” He contends

the American people will be given
this role.

Examples of military domin-
ance in the US,‘ such as the Kent
State and‘ Southern , University
killings, the riots at the Demo-
cratic Convention in 1968, and mil-
itary training of civilian police for
riot control were his proof of this
theory.

“Kent State was no accident,"
he said. He described the methods
handling riots as vastly

changed over past decades. Water
and tear gas were to be used as
last resorts. Now bullets are the
final answer.

A military takeover is closer
than we think, according to Her-
bert. “You should consider your-
self lucky‘ if you get to vote in
1976. But I hope you’ll be able to
laugh at me._”

The volunteer Army will be an-
other aid in a military takeover of
the United States, he believes.
“This volunteer Army will des-
troy" you.” Because of career ori-
ented GI’s, officers will have no
trouble getting their commands

carried out. Herbert also cited the,\

low IQ of enlisted men as advan-

.tageous to the’ Army. One Army

official was to have said that
these are the right_men to carry a
weapon: those who will unques-
tioning obey a command.

Herbert also described the
Army’s operations plans to oc-
cupy American cities. Presently,
they are used merely as tactical
exercises, but'they could easily

Life Style Alternatives Discussed

Ellis Views Marriage -  

by JOHN POULI/N
Dr. Albert Ellis, a clinical psy-

chologist and author of Sex With-'

out Guilt and The Sensuous Per-
son, delivered a lecture Monday
in the Student Union Ballroom on

V "The Institution of Marriage as

It Exists Today.” Speaking at
noon to a near capacity crowd,
Ellis‘ topic opened this week’s
"Alternative Life,Styles Confer-
ence." sponsored by the Student
Union Board.

Ellis began his,,lecture by point-
out the “distinct disadvantages"
of conventional marriage, and by
saying, "It simply doesn’t work
that well for most of the people
most of the time. He then briefly
discussed cohabitation. commun-
al living, homosexuality, and fem-
inism as alternative life styles.
but likewise identified their weak-
nesses. He concluded that what
he calls “civilized adultery" is
the best alternative, and predicts
its widespread acceptance "in

 about 50 years."

According to Ellis, convention-
al marriage in the United States
is “more popular than ever be-
fore.” But “as high as 75 per cent
of married couples have overt
adulterous relationships.” He at-
tributes this statistic to a number
of inherent weaknesses in the in-
stitution. Says Ellis, “It is too
much of a one to one relationship,”
and it insensibly “rules out other
kinds of relationships.” Further-
more, the couple generally has a
“possessive and jealous atti-
tude” toward one another. The re-
sult, he says, is a “double life of

—:thr_ee. o_r,'four"that we canvreally

way was “because he was a bach-
elor.”’ .
“Cohabit‘ation," says Ellis. "is
the new name for ‘free love.” He
feels that cohabitation is not real-
ly an alternative. but a “momen-
tary. trial period," and a very
functional prelude to marriage.
Ellis stated that only “10—15 per
cent of those married have lived

inferred that many present mar-
riage problems could have been
prevented. "But." he said. "co-
habitation has many of the same
disadvantages as conventional
marriage."

Ellis discussed communal liv-
ing by raising a number of prob-
lems which it entails. He.said.
"Most of-us have,enough difficul-

 desperation',_”_.j_oking that the only/. ty in] findingone mate, ‘let alone

be implemented for practical use.

The media, too, is a target of
the government. “When Nixon
gets the press under his thumb.
we’re finished.”

Fear of change ‘is another con-
tributing factor. “There are flag-
waving Americans who would
rather see their own sons dead in
the streets than change the sys-
tem.”

Herbert described‘ opposition
to amnesty as a way of getting
even for lack of support. “'I'here
is no reason for me to oppose am-
nesty because I don‘t want re-
vengef‘

He blamed the atrocities in Viet
Nam on the officers, not the en-
listed man. They oversaw,- and of-
ten participated in the crimes.

One such action was \called
“sewing,” in which children were
placed ear to ear and a wire was
systematically threaded through
their heads if a person observing
refused to talk.

get along with." Also. there are
always those who don't pull their
own weight and this causes antag-
onistic feelings. Another difficul-

ty lies -in trying to coordinate a -
» number of different habits, parti-

cularly sleeping, And, says Ellis,
"Jealousy is usually prevalent
when one in the group is particu-
larly ‘ attractive and everyone
wants to sleep with him or her.

Homosexuality, either‘ male or
female, tends to be a “temporary

alternative,” says Ellis. “Very'

few relationships of this typeare
prolonged. ‘

 , Feminism is a rare. if not im- V
possible, alternative. according to .
- Ellis. A feminist could retain her

views in a home atmosphere only
if "theshusband was not a male
chauvinist pig,” and “the major-
ity._” says Ellis, “still are.“ He
smaintained “the impracticality
of a woman living alone," for in-
evitably her life style would be
interrupted by “her dire need for
love." He said that a woman def-
initely has a “greater dependency

on intimate relationships than a -

man." but could not say whether
this has a biological or social ori-
gin. .
"The best alternative,“ says
' Ellis. "is ‘civilized adultery.” He.
defines it as "a marriage in which
both have leeway to make out-
side involvement." According to
Ellis. “Either of the two could
have a ‘fling’ while still maintain-
ing the original relationship.“

Realizing that such a "fling" will
probably cause the other partner
to feel‘ jealous, Ellis proposes

WYEP Starts ‘Radio Revolution’

by.LOIS LEVINSON

Aidvocating a radio revolution. the Pittsburgh
Community Broadcasting Corporation (PCBC) Is
taking a step backwards in order to move forward.

The corporation plans to set up a listener sup-

 ported radio station, WYEP—FM, that would fill the

I . gaps it feels exist in Pittsburgh broadcasting.

Fifty years ago, Pittsburgh was a pioneer in

__  radio, bringing a refreshing variety of music, dra-

ma, and live entertainment to the populace via the

air waves.

General manager of the PCBC, Jeff Smith

 ’ wants to return to an early time in radio‘s evolu-

'.7_:'tio'n and redevelop it.

1.

Says Smith, "Radio is doing less and less to

  stimulate the minds and imaginations of the listen-'

ing public. We want to make radio and innovative
experience; something people can relate to instead
of- a bland escape.

 K “We want to establish one radio station in Pitts-
b“Iii'gh that will not shrink from asking embarrass-

I ’ , ing questions or looking into corners or speaking for
7‘ . those who have no voice. -

Community oriented. the PCBC solicits ideas

j_'-,' and help from the public. They welcome diverse
:. g opinions.

I As broadcasters, Smith, along with PCBC Pres-

‘/‘. ident Ellory Schempp (a research scientist at the

 University), believe their responsibility lies in pro-
;:* viding information concerning the institutions and
“facilities serving the community. '
‘_ , Smith says, “We want to touch {on issues that
affect your way of life.” ° '

Proof of this desire to communicate with peo-

 ple following varying life-styles. can be seen in their

I All» proposed format. It includes blues. jazz. classical.
~ ..ethnic, folk, and rock music. Listeners might be

   
 
 
  
   
 
 

 
 

 

startled to hear sounds from an aboriginal rain for
'_ est for ten minutes and a4 Brahms piano concerto
 for the next number.

You might also hear Ralph Nader speak on con-

 sumer rights or a listener describe his reasons for
j’ being in a picket line.

, _Right now the station is waiting for approval
from the Federal Communications Commission for
 alicense of an educational, tax-exempt status. This

I», may take until March or even longer.

In the meantime. sample programming is now
being heard from 4 to 5 p.m. Monday. Wednesday.
and Friday on WDUQ—FM. .

Swartz and Smith are now in the process of
raising the funds they will need to cover expenses
for technical equipment. They hope to pay for pa/rt
of the expense with small foundation grants and
large individual contributions.

They anticipate raising a large portion of the
expense by selling membership or subscriptions to

theystation. This, they maintain will leave them

completely free in their programming.

According to Smith, most educational radio and
television stations receive the bulk of their money
from corporation grants which tend to influence
their programming. ‘

“Listeners will provide all the money for our
operating expenses." says member John Schwartz.
"and we will remain free of commercials and the
resulting mediocrity caused by commercialism.

Once you make a contribution,” says Smith,
“you will become a member of the station with a
vote in the elections for the Board of Directors (to
be elected each year) and will receive a program
listing for some special programs. ~

“Most importantly. you will know that you are
responsible. entirely. for the existence of the sta-
tion. It will be yours.“ V

Lower parking rates. reduced

of the projects the Commuter As-

this year. according to Margie
Masilunas. CA president.

In the CA elections last week.
Masilunas. a junior. was re-elect-
ed to a second term as president.
Monica Cirocco was elected vice-
president; Peggy Chomas. secre-
tary. and Glenn Pew. treasurer.

“We’re planning an Office of
Commuter Affairs that would op-
erate like the Office of Residence
Life for the dorm students. This
way commuters could have a
place to go to see an administra-
tor and get help with commuting
problems. A

ing to try to get some of the park-
ing meters removed or get the
rates lowered,“ Masilunas said.

How To Evaluate A Fine

  I Persian Rug A

Persian rugs interest more and
‘more people who do their own
decorating today. Internat.ional
l‘ I Persian Rug Weavers invites you

‘_ , » " to share the opportunity to view a

free exhibit so you can evaluate
and learn about Oriental Rugs.
Within the next decade it’s certain
that the value of these rugs will
increase steadily and will not be
 readily available. The children
. between 5-14 years who do 755'} of

 the weaving are not allowed to

work. They must go to school.
Consider for a moment the ques-
tion of wage . . . A weaver earns

- anywhere from 50 to 70 rials per
day. ‘This is equivalent to 75¢ per
day In U.S. currency. It takes a
long time to make a rug. A master
rug weaver can tie 8,000 to 12,000
"knots daily. If a rug has 400 knots

‘ per square inch it would take over
one and a half years to.complete
a 9x12 carpet!

Blue Chips during the 12 year
period of 1958 to 1970 show an in-
crease of only 43.7% but during
the same period inflation has
eroded those dollars by 58.6‘); . Even
land investments, which appreci-
ated in value far more than the
stock market. cannot keep up with
the spectacular investment record
of fine rugs. Although not gen-
erally recognized for their invest-
ment potential fine Persian and
Oriental rugs have risen in value
by more than 100% for a similar
period.‘
Now Is A Good Time To Invest
In Fine Rugs

We invite residents of the Pitts-
burgh area and private collectors
to visit this important Exhibit and
Auction to learn more about these
magnificient carpets. All our rugs
have a five-year warranty. In ad-
dition, a purchaser can exchange
a rug of comparable value within

We’re also trying to get this area
designated as a student parking
area.”

The CA recently created a Car
Pool Board with the aid of Terry
Milani, Student Union manager
from the Office of Student Affairs.
Plans include securing a Pitts-
burgh-area, a tri-state-area, and
a national map to show students
when someone will be driving, for
example to Philadelphia for the
weekend. “If a. dorm student
whose home is in Harrisburg
wants.a ride home that weekend,
he can get in touch with the person
driving to Philadelphia,” Masil-

“ unas said. “This project will re-

quire the co-operation of the dorm
students.”

The CA also plans to work more
closely with the Student Govern-
ment (SG) than it has in the past.
Bob Heister, a member of the CA,
was elected to the SG Board ear-
lier this month. '

The CA will continue its efforts

to get reduced rates for students '

who use Port Authority buses.
"We’d like to have something

where students could use their
University picture ID’s and get a
special pass giving them a reduc-
tion of 10 or 15 cents in the fare. - ’

“Port Authority is going to paint
one of its buses blue and gold in
honor of Pitt, along with a red and
blue one for Duquesne, and a plaid
one for CMU. This is a result of
one of the un-fruitful meetings we

‘ had with PAT. It's to show they’re

still thinking about us.”

Another plan of the CA is to
have an Automotive Information
Committee. “We’re going to buy
some car manuals and put them
on reserve in the library for stu-
dents to look at,” Masilunas said.

“We’ve planned to have a me-
chanic to come to Pitt sometime
in March and demonstrate such
things as how to change tires,
check oil, and see if'your spark
plugs, are good are bad.”

The CA will continue to have its

intramural teams which current- I

1y incluide basketball and volley-
ball. Any commuter who is inter-
ested in joining the teams, which
are co—ed, all male, and all female,
is asked to contact the CA in Room

Catch 22  

, by MIKE MILLER
, Editor

-I ~ Several weeks ago, the news media reported that a combined
orce of Navy, Air Force, and Marine aircraft bombed the U.S. air-
ase at Da Nang, giving rise to rumors that Milo Minderbinder of
.:Catch 22 was alive and well.

: Recent developments in the Student Government Elections reveal
hat Milo Minderbinder has shifted his operations to the University.

- l ' The Student Government Elections Committee acts as the first
court of appeal in an elections dispute, according to the election code,
‘i which -they did Sunday night, when they upheld the validity of Rege
{3;Kaufman’s election. .
1 However, when anyone challenges the elections procedure. they
re challenging the committee which upheld the procedure.

 Therefore] the Elections Committee, when challenged, acts as both
«Judge and defendant in_the hearing. Catch 22.

N If the challengers are not satisfied with the result of the Elec-
"ions Committee hearing, they can take the case to the Judicial Board.

 _When the Judicial Board convenes, four of its six members must
:;be present for a quorum. Of four members present at Mor.day’s hear-
ji’ng_, one was said to be personally involved and another was believed to
.' have vested interests in upholding the original decision.

   
   
  
 
   
  
 
  
  
   
  
   
   
  
  
   
  
   
  
  
  
   
  
  
   
  
    
       
  

 g; /I For a proper quorum, the two alternate members had to be sum-
,'.fno'n'ed. Peter.Bouvier, Judicial Board Advisor, reported that one of
f’ these people has never answered his phone or responded to corres-
..-pondence. The other has no records at the University. Either he does
..not exist or he is in worse shape than the dead man in Yossarian's tent.

 Bouvierwdid not name this second man, but it would not be surpris-
ng if he was an ex-private first class named Wintergreen. -

,rtion.=‘case, was given 12 hours to prepare an appeal after he lost Sun-
-7d_a.y nights decision. The SG Constitution gives him five days. Concilla
"claims that he was told that the procedings had to be dispensed with
 uickly so as not to interfere with Thursday’s “Inaugural Gala"

if-7‘ The press has not been invited to the “Inaugural Gala“ and would

1 lot have known of its existence without a press release from a Lieuten-
nt Scheisskopfi, stating that there would be no parade at thefestival.

 

‘ Kaufman could resign on the grounds that he was as insane as
these election procedures and unfit to be president, but anyone who
.-wants to be president must be insane. Conversely, anyone who wants
utmust be /sane and ‘owes it to the student body to remain in his posi-
ion’. Whew! 

-77-i.j..'_;_.Rumors are also flying that SG is buying into the Egyptian cotton
ndu/str_y_i_n an attempt tobalance its budget. -
f If we did not know better we might think that there were Air Force
fficers running the University. -

Column And A Half  

by JOHN METCALFE

I seem to be cursed with an endless ability to
be annoyed by Richard Milhouse Nixon. This is not
to suggest that a negative response to the man
should be deplored. The curse consists in the fact
that I have been alive through virtually all of that
man‘s public career.

I come from a politically aware background;
almost as soon as I-could tell boys and girls apart.
I could distinguish between Republicans and Demo-
crats.

I was ten years old when Mr. Nixon became the
vice-president of this country. He was already fam-
iliar to me through his efforts in giving the McCar-
thy (Joe) era its peculiar flavor.

Because I could read and write. I mourned Stev-
enson's loss. Because I could speak and understand
English, I thought it a pity we got Eisenhower.

 And so it began. A generation. not of peace. but a

of Nixon. With one exception, that man has_played
a part in every inauguration since 1953. Many under-
graduates were not ever born in January, 1953.

By the time he finally shuffles off the elective
stage in 1977 I will have endured 24 years of his pub-
lic presence.

_ This seems excessive.

It gets worse if we consider his years on ‘Capi-
tal Hill. The total approaches 30 years. .

This is longer than many marriages last, and
they tend to at least begin with a loving relationship.
The thought of such a long relationship with a per-
son who never aroused any emotion other than dis-
tastefulpity would make the strongest character
wilt around the edges. ‘

My character is not of the strongest. I am in-
clined to go beyond wilting, sometimes to the point
of becoming a trifle venomous.

He is the only President who has had an awe-
some amount of power even under the old Constitu-
tional rules. But now . . .

This concentration of power is reason enough
in itself for the strongest doubts. Even if Richard
Nixon were benevolent in the exercise of his mons-
trous powers those powers should be separated
from his office. There is no guarnatee the next oc-
cupant of the office will be benevolent.

When it is further considered that Nixon is any-
thing but benevolent in his exercise of_ powers, it
becomes even more clearly necessary to try to re-
strain him in any way which can be found.

So long as the list of amendments to the Con-
stitution begins with the number “one,” I shall con-
tinue_to use whatever media may be available to me
to share my opinions of Mr. Nixon with whoever is
listening. I will also try to share my interpretation
of the danger he presents to us all.

The precedingtirade was provoked by the un-
veiling of the new budget. In it, funds are cut for
nearly every form of human service; in only one
‘area is there an appreciable increase. Ready?

Defense.

The first peacetime budget in 12 years includes
five billion dollars more for defense than the last
wartime budget did.

There may be a bizarre logic about this. May-

_ be what we were practicing in Vietnam was not de-

fense, after all.

» The traditional pie showing where the money
comes from and where it goes seems to indicate an
even greater expenditure for “Human Resources"
than for defense. This trick is partly managed by
lumping in the Social Security program. which has
never, in intent or in practice, been a part of the
budget—drawing powers of the White House.

It is a sham. Social Security is separately fund-
ed. self-supporting at least in theory, and cannot. in
honesty, be used as a balance to this enormous in-
vestment in the military.

Consider for a moment . . . 80 billion dollars
just to defend ourselves for 12 months.

Can we have offended someone. that each of us
requires four hundred dollars woth of defense every
year? '

When his simultaneous attacks on the pero-
gatives of Congress and his transformation of the
Supreme Court are considered, Mr. Nixon‘s real
priorities begin to emerge.

All. the man wants is absolute power within the
U.S., without even the minor nuisance of open criti-
cism. »

In the\world at large, all he wants is the sheer
power to be able to act, however he pleases. with
out consideration for other nations and their inter.-
ests.

Revolution is a foolish thought. It gives the-

very young something to dream about, and the very
Republican something to worry about, but it is not
a real possibility.

Richard Nixon is certainly not susceptible to
force of arms; he may be susceptible to force of
law. For the first unlikely possibility, he is better
armed than any individual in history has been, and
rarely hesitates to use whatever armament he
owns.

There is one chance. If those who have a right

to power in this country take it back, Nixon might,-

just might, balk at an overt suspension of the Con-
stitution. A small hope, but it‘s all I see.

A friend suggests that the defense budget had
to go up because there never was a war. It was all
staged by two Army privates in a video studio. and
never cost more than a $165 a week. However, as
Nixon acquired new corporate friends, he wanted
to reward them somehow; as they grew more num-
erous, they grew more expensive. Thus, the invent-
ed war. But it backfired. It seemed too real. Cancel
it.

Back to the missile gap; that worked pretty
well. ' '

Odd, It’s been a while, but I seem to recall
Nixon was mixed up in the first missile gap.

Course Of The Week  

by RALPH DEAN

It is the purpose of this column to,
once a week, review a University
course which may be ofiinterest
to students as a possible elective.
Emphasis will be on the unique.

This week: CE 80—Basic Engi-
neering Geology.

Many students shy away from
electing courses in Civil Engi-
mg, reasoning that they appeal to
a narrow range of interests. CE
80, however, is an exception to
that rule, for it has a little some-
thing for everybody. It requires
little prerequisite beyond some
algebra, and the few engineering
terms which are used (“shear,”
etc.) are easily learned through
context. The course is taught by
Dr.. Ackenheil, who is well-known
locally in his field.

CE 80 is primarily concerned
with the engineering applications
of geological information. Non-
CE's can pick up on such topics
as map use and applications. drill-
ing techniques, and some “classi-
cal“ geology.

Catering to early-risers, there
is an 8 a.m. section, and watching
the anticipation-filled faces of the
students as they enter the audi-

' torium is’, I am told','ia fine way to

startrthe day.

For those low in motivation. a
unique incentive system has been
devised, consisting of a quiz every
day at the start of the period.
(Sometimes earlier for variety.)

A fascinating project is also tied
in with the incentive program. (It
cannot effect one’s grade—ex-

‘Jcept, of course, if one doesn’t do

it.) The project consists of attach-

‘ing samplesof specified minerals

to a piece of specified masonite
with a specified glue. Students
are to find many of those samples
themselves, locating outcrops of
these minerals in the region on
geological survey maps, then
seeking out these places in the
field. Theseprove to be interest-

'ing and accessible spots, like New

Kensington and the cliff above the
north end of the Fort Pitt Tunnel.
So, the students are treated to a
tour of Western Pennsylvania, at
their own convenience.

As if that weren’t enough for
the travel buff, the class is treat-
ed almost daily to a Kodachrome
slide‘ show of the instructor’s
travels abroad, on topics ranging
from soil testing in Spain to
blondes in Finland.

_So, if you are looking into an
elective for next year, think
about CE 80. In fact, think about

With the signing of the treaty
on Jan. 27.’ it seems that peace
threatens to come to Vietnam.
and perhaps all of Indochina.

A spirit ofigoodwill has infect-
ed both sides, causing them to
join hands in-burying the prover-
bial hatchet. Even the Commun-
ists, the worst killers since Hit-
ler, will stop murdering innocent
South Vietnamese civilians and let
true peace vmaterialize. But
whether it is a trueipeace, a false
peace, or merely a piece of peace.
the United States is bound to ex-

‘ perience some problems in the

near future.

Think of what peace means to
‘those poor anti-war protesters
who won’t have a war to protest.
They will be walking the streets,
unemployed, unloved, unwanted.
In such a position they might turn
to violence. And what is the U.S.
going to do with all that money we
might have spent protecting South

* Vietnam against those oppressed,

defenseless Communist aggres-
sors, if the war had continued?
Even worse, we are faced with

converting our “wartime econo-‘

my” into a"‘peacetime economy,”
so that we maycure all our social
ills and make our country the Uto-
pian States of -America.

Women Want
  Equal Rights

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Eighty-

two female employees of ‘PPG
Industries jammed a ‘federal
court room Monday to voice their

disapproval of the $1 million set-"T

tlement of a two-year-old sex dis-

The women were among 350 f'e-
male employes who were laid off
‘at the company‘s nearby Creigh-
ton plant in the mid-1950s. They
contend they were passed over for
male employes when the firm-be-

gan rehiring 10 years ago.

Many of the women who testi-
fied __during the final hearing be-
fore U.S. District Court Judge
Wallace’ S. Gourley. on the-pro-

posed settlement said they_ were '

unwilling to give up their rights
to back wages, job reinstatement
and pension benefits for the aver-
age $2',500‘award they each would
receive under the settlement.’

Named in the suit along with
PPG Industries was United Glass
and Ceramic Workers Union Lo-
cal 12, bargaining agent for the
women.

The hearing was continued un-
til Tuesday.

T he Peacetime War

This is a big order, granted. but
there is a way to solve every one
of the above problems in one
clean, simple sweep.

Basic to my plan is the elinina—
tion of the crazy notion which says
that industries now producing war
equipment should adapt to a
peacetime production, making
things that can be used in the.bat-
tie to save the cities or the eco-
nomy. Forget it—it is far too ex-
pensive and time~consuming to
pull a switch like this. when it is
not necessary.

The trick is to adapt the war
material, not the factories, but to
peacetime uses. You will recall
that last year the city of St. Louis
used explosives to eliminate un-
occupied, dilapidated public hous-
ing, and make room for new units.
The job was-‘so quick and effec-
tive, that it could be repeated in
blighted areas of other cities, us-
ing the military, ‘and military
equipment. ' '

The first step would still be to

vacate civilian residents. The des-
truction. though. would be caused
by Air Force jets dropping pin-
point-accuracy “smart bombs."
thus reducing the possibility of er-
rors. Then the Army Corps of
Engineers or Navy Seabees (Con-
struction Battalions) could be
called in to build new housing for
the poor. Ex-anti-war activists.
seeing the good being done, would
flock to join the armed forces in

order to further a great cause.

Other plausible adaptations
come to mind. —

Since there is such a flourishing
market now for destructive, noisy
recreational vehicles like snow-
mobiles and Jeeps, it would be
good business to sell go-anywhere
vehicles. After all, they are even

noisier and more destructive than ’

civilian products. Picture the
standard six-wheel drive Army
truck with a camper body on the
back, or a motor homemade from
the boxy armored‘ personnel car-
rier. And it would be some thrill
dashing through the snow in a
tank, smooth-driving with a V-8
engine and automatic transmis-
sion. -

A friend of mine who is a Viet-
nam veteran tells me that the
Army has developed a “baseball"
grenade, shaped like the real
thing and supposedly just as much
to throw. Baseball is a sport
with many dull moments. and re-
placement of the ball with such a

hand grenade could liven things up.

and draw thousands of additional
spectators to the more interest-

ing games. The grenade business _

would boom; baseball would be a
blast.

lVIore conventional military
armaments could be sold to the
outdoorsmen or shooting enthusi-
asts. Rifle teams would certainly
find their hobby more stimulating
if ‘they abandoned their “22’s“

for_ tripod-mounted M-50 machine
guns. The gun lobby should be
overjoyed if every American citi-
zen had a loaded M-16 rifle in his
hall closet. These weapons would

-let even hunters play search and

destroy.“
A state of peacetimewar would

exist, and would be financed just
like a wartime war. With the Fed-

for a future appeal. ’Ging.added,

“Your body was not to have been

At that time Dave Bluey who

was_in_volved in the alleged.bri--

bery issue interjected, “I’d like
to see this cleared up in the best
time.” He added that if the issue
was not cleared up, both Kauf-
man’s and his credentials would

The Board deliberated and Lynn
announced that she , would dis-

sue because of, her involvement in
the election. Steeber, however, re-
fused to disqualify himself. ex-
plaining that he felt that the Judi-
cial Board was “the ultimate body
as far as Student Government is-
sues go."

Because Zimmerman had dis-
qualified herself there’ was no
longer a quorum and the Board
discussed possible channels for
the appeal. Steeber commented
that a decision should not be post-
poned until a new Judicial Board
was appointed.

Ging asked that the Board rec-

ommend that the appeal be heard ‘

by the. University Review Board.
The Judicial’ Board deliberated

Grease, the new 50‘s musical

‘ 1‘ comedy that is one of the biggest

hits of the current Broadway sea-

son, opens at the Nixon Theatre _

for one weekbeginning Monday,
Feb. _12, through Saturday, Feb.

Grease brings back the look and
,sound of the late 50’s, thefirst
such musical since Bye, Bye Bir-
die and. equally as successful.
Writers Jim Jacobs and Warren
Casey, who wereboth teenagers
fguring the 50’s, .have steered
lear of the “camp” variety of

_ 6 musical that this type of material‘

so often provokes.‘ Instead, they
_have attempted to recapture the

 

flavor of that inane world of the
early

back with grease into the famous

‘DA, and the girls wore poodle
_ skirts, penny loafers, and threw-

pajama parties where they smok-
ed cigarettes instead-of pot.

And the music is all there, rem-
iniscent of the Elvis Presley hey-

day, with such titles as “Rock ‘n’ -

Roll Party Queen,” “It’s Raining
on Prom Night,” “Beauty School

Dropout,” “Look at Me,’ Pm San- _

dra Dee,” “Shakin’ at the High

,,School -Hop,” and many others

that read like a roll of the top ten
of the 1950's.

Squad

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIlllllllllll||||llI||||llllE , . l_.

One of the criticisms of Pitt’s basketball team is that head
coach Buzz Ridl is using too many players on the varsity.
check on most other collegiate teams, especially the nationally
ranked ones, indicates that the majority of the nation‘s hoop
teams have similarly e_n_dowed squads.

The. problem is that Ridl has been unable to decide on a
staring lineup, let alone his top reserves. He seems to have tak-
en steps in the right direction. though. ’

For the last three games, two of which were victories. he
has used the starting lineup of Billy Knight, Lucius Keese. Tom-
my Richards, Mickey Martin, and Kirk Bruce.

For Ridl, it was a long and difficult process
in deciding ona starting lineup. There is no
guarantee that he will continue to use the pre-
sent lineup, but at least he has chosen one.

Because of the size of the squad, 12. Ridl
faces the predicament of having his players
unable to play up to their potential, as it is
quite difficult to maintain one’s shooting eye
when playing only a few minutes each game.

13>

. RIDL
When the season opened. the squad was comprised of only
-710 men. but freshmen Tommy Richards and Keith Starr have
joined the varsity, and proved without a doubt that they belong
there. -

So Ridl has a starting lineup, and he has cut down on the
number of players appearing in each game. This had to be done,
as in order for his players to maintain a decent shooting per-
centage, they must be in for most of the game.

However, he must not lose sight of the other players on” the

squad. He has a diversified array of talent on his bench. and the‘

need for their various talents comes up in different situations in

different games throughout the season. There is not one player '

on the varsity who has not been a factor in a winning effort this
season. ‘

For example. Ken Wagoner. Wagoner is not rated an ex-
cellent shooter, but has maintained a near .500 shooting aver-
age, despite seeing irregular action. But shooting isn’_t his
forte. and he knows it. His strength is in his defense, and at 6’3”,

The Pitt Panther wrestling
troupe hits the road for the sec-
ond straight match tonight. as
the Cats travel to Kent. Ohio.
to duel Kent State and attempt
to cop their first meet as a visit-
ing team. Pitt is in the middle of
a four match road trip that has
seen them lose to Clarion, 25-14.

on Saturday to face F&M and
East Strousburg.

The Panthers, who are 3-5. can
inch a bit closer to the .500 mark
which has eluded them all but
once this season. Indeed, the pros-
pects of meeting the Golden
Flashes must look sweet to the
Cats, who have had to travel
twice, to Michigan and to Clar-
ion, both of whom fielded power-
ful squads. and both of whom
beat Pitt.

The Flashes have not been wow-
ing the Kent area with awesome
displays of grap prowess; they
are 1-5, having played rubber ball
to Ohio University, Penn State.

Western Michigan, mostly by big
scores.

Kent’s‘only win was an upset.

but was quick to add f‘We’re very

Another example is Sam Fleming. Fleming has seen little
varsity action, and his shooting has suffered from it, but he is
the type of player that can. get the hot hand, and spark the team

Also seeing limited duty is Willis Cardot. Cardot has yet to
miss a foul shot, and came off the bench to spark a victory over
Rutgers early in the season. One of Cardot’s specialties is in
breaking a press, and he is also a good man to have in when the
other team has to foul late in the game. How Ridl could have
used him in the N otre Dame game.

William & Mary Team

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
" Associate Sports Editor

The Pitt basketball team will
try to come a game closer to the
.500 mark when they host the Wil-
liam and Mary Indians this com-
ing Saturday at the Field House

' at1:30 p.m.

After the impressive victory
against .Penn State last weekend
the Panthers now hold .a 7-10 rec-

_r91'd on the season.

The new lights that have been
placed in the Field House will
come in handy this weekend be-
cause the contest against the In-
dians will be televised (it is the
Eastern -Athletic Conference.
ECAC. game of the week).

In the nine game series with the

I William and Mary squad the Pan-

thers find themselves behind by
4-5. -

The meeting last year between
the two squads was also shown on
television but this time around
the Panther cagers hope that they
can give a much more impressive
performance. '

The Cats led through most of
the contest but in the last minute
of the game William and Mary re-
ceived a new breathe of life and
steamed ahead of the Panthers to
win by the score of 73-68.

Pitt’s head basketball coach

Buzz Ridl and his staff areanti-‘

cipating another tough game with
the Indians on Saturday. He sees
William and Mary to be a young
squad but one to be reckoned with.
According to Ridl William and
Mary’s 4-13 record is not indica-
tive of how the team can really
play. , .
"William and Mary is a young
team. they usually have about
three freshman and two seniors
in their starting lineup." related
the Pitt mentor. "But it’s going to
be agood game on Saturday."
"Three of William and Mary's
most outstanding freshmen hoop-
sters are Michael Arizin. Rod

Indiana Wants Revenge ,

While the Pitt Hockey Club was busy keeping in
shape with two/‘exhibition games in two weeks. Car-
negie-Mellon moved back into a tie with the icers

for first place in the City Division of the Western —

Pennsylvania’ Intercollegiate Hockey Association.
Pitt will meet Indiana tonight at the‘ Alpine Ice

As of this writing. both Pitt and C—MU have 14
points and are tied for first with the same amount
of games played. The Tartans, however, had a game
yesterday with St. Francis and that, of course. is an

, easy two points. That would put C—MU ahead of
Pitt. with Pitt battling a tough Indiana squad tonight. r

Since Pitt defeated Indiana back in November.
Indiana has not lost another game. Indiana. cur-
rently in first place of the Metropolitan Division.

has been constantly improving with every contest. *

In Rematch With‘ Ieers

When Pitt met Indiana, it was the latter’s seasonll,-.'
opener and Indiana didn't have much ice time to .

prepare for it. »

Tonight's rematch will also feature the second.‘ , ‘f
meeting of Pitt’s Denny Browne and Indiana’s Tim‘ C‘ 
Rearden. In their first meeting, the two engaged in r —
a ferocious round of fisticuffs. Rearden, six feet 

\ Ill.

three inches tall and an ex-Marine, received the
beating of his life from Browne. -

Last Saturday night a large turnout of Pitt sup- , 
porters came out to cheer the skaters on and the};
team members are hoping for some help in the 
stands tonight. Buses will leave for the Alpine at  .-
8:30 p.m. from the Fifth Ave. side of the Student  
Union. Tickets for the contest can be obtained from A _ ~ 2

office. '

It looks like a two team race in the City Divi-

sion of the WPIHA "since C—MU gave the Duquesne I 
Dukes another serious setback in the fight for the ,-

top two positions and the two playoff spots. The

. Tartans shutout the Dukes-5-0 and have an eight 4 I 
"point lead over them. The Dukes kept what slim,

hopes they have alive by defeating St. Vincents on‘
Sunday night.

Indiana also played the Tartans to a stalemate

earlier this season and will be looking for at least  
one point out of tonight‘s contest. 'It’s a general . ""

12 Man Squad

(Continued from Page 9)
The Notre Dame game was a perfect example of why a di-

l' I versified squad is needed. Wtih three players out with the flu.‘

Cardot, Mickey Martin, and Carl Morris, Ridl’s 12 man squad
was cut to nine, and when foul trouble set in. he had practically
/no choice in who to play. As a result, those players who did not

foul out were unable to get a breather, and the Irish came from
’ . behind and eventually won in overtime.

_ But don’t consider the forementioned players as out of the
-picture for the remainder of the season. Stop and remember
what Lucius Keese, Richards, and Starrwere doing just a few
weeks ago. Also, don't forget that Pitt has been free of injuries

 this season, and this can turn into a serious problem, although’
I T Ridl has the depth to cope with it. -

Right now, there is only one player who is unreplaceable on
the squad, based on performances to date. and that player is. of
course, Billy Knight.

If a coach is indecisive. a 12 man squad can ruin a basket-
ball team, both in record and moral, butif he knows how to ma-

 nipulate a squad that size, it can be the key to many victpries.

Williams would be out for the sea-

comment on this issue.

Besides having the distinction
of being the most eager skater to
drop his gloves, Denny Browne‘
also leads the team in scoring.

. Browne is averaging better than

two goals per game and was a key
factor in Pitt’s recent exhibition
victories. Browne, along with Phil
Clarke’_ and Billy Glanville make
up the “lush line.”

Glenn Hyde will be playing
against Indiana for the first time
this year. Hyde missed the last
contest due to the fact that the
football season was not'over. Talk
at the Belmont Ice Arena, the
home ice for Indiana, before Pitt’s
victory, was that Rearden would
be looking to take on Hyde if the
going got rough.

Hyde has only scoredione goal
so far this season but has limited

Pink Panthers
Drop. 1st Meet

by VICKY VETERE

Saturday. the Pitt women‘s gymnastics team was defeated by
Youngstown University by the slim margin of two points with the score
85-83. _

Coach Gail 'DiCicco described the meet as "real close. tense. but
enjoyable." She added. “This is the first time we've been beaten by
Youngstown. They defintely have a much stronger team this year
than they have had in the past.“

The Pitt women gymnasts took a total of five places in the four
events and managed to capture one first place.

Youngstown’s strongest event was the uneven parallel bars as they

took first, second, and third places. Pitt’s first place came on .the floor 

exercise by Donna DiMarino who had a high score of 8.3. Youngstown
took both second and third places in this event.

Vaulting seemed to be Pitt’s overall strong event. Even though
Youngstown took first place. Pitt‘s Kathy Krynock and Holda Jones
captured second and third. respectively. on two very fine vaults.

Beam showed similar results as Youngstown took first. leaving
Pitt's Donna DiMarino with second and Anne Monahan with third.

This weekend’s loss to Youngstown evens the Pink Panthers’ rec- ‘A

0rd at 1-1. Last Saturday they stunned West Virginia University-in the
season opener by the score of 78-58.

In that meet with WVU. Pitt took first. second. and third places in
all events except the floor exercise. But the highlight of the afternoon
occurred when Pitt’s DeMarino scored a fantastic 8.53 on her floor

exercise routine. capturing the highest score at the meet and securing - I5

a first place for Pitt in the event.

In addition to her first place on floor. DeMarino placed third in
vaulting with a 7.10. She also captured third place on the beam and-the
uneven parallel bars. -

Pink Panther Krynock also had an outstanding day taking first
place on the uneven parallel bars with a 6.97 and first place in vault-
ing with a 7.53. Second place in the vault was captured by Pitt’s Jones,‘
a newcomer to the team this season. Her score was 7.33.

Second place on the uneven parallel bars went to Pitt's Anna Krupa ~  I

who scored a 6.10. Patty Martin of Pitt secured second place on the
beam while first place went to teammate Monahan who scored a
fine 7.27,on her performance.

With two meets now behind them. the Pink Panthers move on the  .‘

road to face a double. bill this weekend as they travel to Franklin and

Marshall College on Friday. Feb. 2. and to Temple on Saturday. Feb. 3.

Draft Ends First Day

NEW YORK (AP) — John Ma-
tuszak “dreamed” ob being pick-
ed by Houston in the National
Football League draft and the Oil-
ers sticking close to general pre-
dictions, made it come true yes-
terday by taking Tampa’s 275-
pound defensive superman num-
ber one.

Matuszak, who was kicked off
the University of Missouri team
in 1970 after being charged with
felonious assault, transferred to
Tampa and became a little-publi-
cized senation at tackle.

Baltimore’s wheeler-dealer
Colts — with the second choice -
got quarterback Bert Jones of
Louisiana State, but it was other
wise a day for giant linemen from
college football's Class of ’72.

Jones was the only quarterback
in the first 32 picks.

The Philadelphia Eagles pick-
ed 250-pound offensive tackle Jer-
ry Sisemore of Texas and the
New England Patriots followed by
locking up 263-pound Alabama
guard John Hannah.

S/elections went slowly as 26
NFL teams lumbered through the
first of 17 rounds due to provide
442 rookie prospects. The first
round required three hours, 22
minutes. ’

Houston earned the dubious

honor of choosing first by stumb-

to balance the power.

“New look”
into the number two drafting posi-
tion via a trade with New Orleans.

Thomas created another mild stir
by bagging the strongarmed
Jones. ,

Marty Domres. the Colts’ crown
prince at quarterback when
Thomas ordered John Unitas
benched, was sitting at the Balti-
more table in a New York hotel

ton put him number one.

“I’ve always seemed to be the
guy who just missed out,” he said.
“This is a great thrill. I know my
future is ahead of me and I've got
to work at it.” ’

The 22-year-old Matuszak
wasn’t even voted his team’s most
valuable player in high school at
Oak Creek, Wis., and he was
passed over in MVP voting at
Tampa in favor of defensive end
