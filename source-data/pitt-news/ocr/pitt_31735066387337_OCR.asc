Officials may get
to revoke licenses

HARRISBURG (AP) — Local
sheriffs and their deputies would
be given the power to seize sus-
pended or revoked licenses and
registrations from Pennsylvania
motorists under legislation pro-
posed Tuesday. -

Sen. Edwin G. Holl, R-
Montgomery, said additional en-
forcement is nee_ded to collect an
estimated 636,000 suspended or
revoked licenses and registrations

5 across.the state. Currently, local

and state police have the authori-
ty to seize the voided documents.
» ,"’A collective effort by all law-
enforcement officials will be
necessary to get these uninsured
reckless drivers off the
street,” Holl said during an after-
noon news conference.

Prior to 1985, about 110 state
troopers were authorized to take
the suspended or revoked docu-
ments. The number of enforce-
ment officials jumped to 231,960
when local police were added to
the ranks in 1985. j '

Theaddition of the sheriffs
would raise the number of
officers to 23,537.

Licenses and registrations are
revoked by the state transporta-

.tion department when it receives

notification that a driver has
failed to maintain insurance.
However, many drivers continue
to drive without a license, regis-
tration or insurance, Holl said.

Drivers may also have licenses
and registrations revoked for var-

ious other reasons, including

such violations as drunken
driving.

”Uninsured and reckless
motorists contribute greatly to the
automobile insurance crisis in
Pennsylvania,” Holl said.

He said the addition of local
police has been slow to have an
impact on the situation because
PennDOT only recently began

supplying them with lists of-

drivers who have revoked or sus-
pended documents". 2

program aimed at helping stu- .

Drab, the current president of

 the Academy of Pharmacy Stu-

' was not instituted because of im-~

mediate need. ”We don't ever
want to have to use it, but if a
problem arises, we want to be
able to deal with it,” he said. .

Consisting of pharmacy stu-’

the committee encourages chem-

WASHINGTON —- The Senate
“voted 98-0 Tuesday to ban all Ira-
nian imports into the United
States.

The United States_has import-
ed $500 million to $600 million
worth of products annually from
Iran in recent years, according to

the proposal offered by Senate

Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan.

Iranian oil sales to the United
States are skyrocketing this year.
The Commerce Department

reported Monday that imports of

oil and petroleum products from
Iran went from $498 million inall
of 1986 to $819 million through
July of 1987.

The vote attached the amend-
ment to a pendingbill authoriz-
ing the Pentagon budget for the
fiscal year which begins Thurs-
day. The only senators not voting
were two contenders for the
Democratic presidential nomina-
tion, Sens. Albert Gore of Tennes-
see and Paul Simon of Illinois.

The House defense authoriza-
tion bill, passed in May, does not
contain a ban on Iranian imports.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 30, I987

By Polly Thornton
For The Pitt News

Editor's Note: The .writer of this
article attended and participated
in. the following event.

This past weekend, the Coun-
cil of Three Rivers American In-
dian Center hosted its ninth
annual Pow Wow at 200 Charles
St. in Pittsburgh.

The two day program of events
included competitive tribal danc-
ing, demonstration dances by
hired dancers and dances for the
spectators to participate in,

Representatives of 38 tribes

competed in Traditional and Fan-

cy Dance catagories. Traditional
dancers performed even, meas—
ured steps in time with the drum,
wearing costumes made of buck-
skins and feathers in their natur-
al colors-

More colorful costumes were
worn for the Fancy Dances, in
which the dancers style varied ac-
cording to tribal customes and
personal taste.

In order to alleivate the cost of
hiring singers and dancers, the
Council had a blanket dance. The
lead man and woman dancers
carried a blanket around the
floor, and both the competitors
and spectators contributed
money for the Center.

In addition to the dancing,
booths were set up with Indian
crafts for the.tourists to buy. The
craftsmen’s wares included silver
jewelery, bead and leather work

and other "examples of tribal

crafts.

”Each group of people was
given their own way from the
Great Spirit,” said Nancy Crome,

After the last planned activity
for the evening was over and
most of the spectators had left,
the Indians gathered around fires
to play their drums and sing.
Someone brought a copper pot
and ‘roasted potatoes in it for a
late-night snack.

Though most of thesongs did
not have words but rather held a
closer resemblance to chanting,
they each told a story. The Indi-
ans were more than happy to ex-
plain these to those interested.
They seemed to enjoy having
people interested in learning their
culture and encouraged people to
join in their songs and try their

— hand at playing the drum.

The Center was founded in
I969 as a place where urban In-
dians could gather to celebrate
their cultural traditions. Their pro-

By William Young and
Susan Washburn

Going into the basement of
Graffiti to do an interview with
The Affordableﬂoors is more like
walking into a c house where
a group of friends sit around and
talk’ about life. '

Nothing formal, nothing re-
hearsed, just a group of guys who
are perfectly at ease with each
other and their music. A group
that appears comfortable reveal-
ing their past and hopeful about
their future.

The Affordable Floors are un-
tarnished idealism. A band wait-

. ing in the wings and having fun

while they are there.

The formative days of the band
were when Kirk Botula, Harvey
Coblin and Eric Riebling began
playing. But, they weren't really
The Affordable Floors.

”We don't consider the band
to have started until
[Zenkevich] and I joined in late
fall of '85,” said guitarist Steve
Morrison.

”Kirk, Harvey and Eric had
been playing together before, but
we don't talk about those days.
That wasn’t The Affordable
Floors,” he added with a slight
smile.

Since their conception, the
band has concentrated on
producing original music. They
shun the thought of being a cover
band.

”We didn't start out a cover
band; in fact, we didn't do a
cover until we established our-
selves as an original band,” said
Zenkevich.

So, The Affordable Floors
decided in 1986 to enter the Tri-
State Rock Competition. They
won. The prize was the chance

Pump Boys and "Dinettes is a

”No, no, no. They were around
for years before we hooked up
with them. They had been think-
ing about forming a record label
for a long time, and l believe they
released a few heavy metal al-
bums before they hooked up with
us,” said Morrison.

”But we were their first major,
well, semi-major release.”

Since the release of their album
of originals entitled The Sound-
ing, The Affordable Floors and
Zapple Records have enjoyed
success. ln fact, The Sounding
sold more copies than any other
local bands release for the past
10 years.

Certainly, a marginal success
for a new band. Since the release
of The Sounding, the Affordable
Floors have been on their ”world
tour,” which ended up in
Creensburg, Pa.

The show played New York for
a time but has now taken to the
open road to present their ener-

Pump Boys and Dinettes has
been receiving rave reviews.
Clive Barnes of the New York
Post said: ”The two words that
best describe Pump Boys and
Dinettes ‘are ’totally terrific!’ ”

Mel Gusow of the New York’

ly; ”Pump Boys and Dinettes is

The cover that most audiences i

know is ”Temptation” by New
Order. ”But we quit doing that af-
ter the New Order concert party‘.
We thought it was a good place
to seal it. It was really a touching
moment. We said, ’This is the last
time we'll be playing ’Tempta—

Ken.

”Now we do ‘Cashmere,’ and
we’re waiting for people to say
we do it better than Led Zeppelin.

’Cashmere,’ and people were like

_ ’What the Hell?’ ”

Today, The Affordable Floors
are working on some new
material.

"We just recorded two new
songs. We're undecided on
whether to release them as sin-
gles or an EP or an album,” said
Morrison.

”We’re not sure what the
product will be, but it will be out,

and it's going to be soon,” added
Kirk

What do they see ahead for the
next album?

”A collection of songs built
around a beat  a tentative title
for the album is Drum Songs,”
said Kirk, ”and the songs are built
around different rhythms."

The Affordable Floors, like vir-
tually every other band, is look-
ing for a major label.

”The label is waiting to hear

more material, and that's still‘

pending. Well, they were sup-
posed to send a man out from the
LA office, but  said Morrison.

”But it crashed,” added Harvey ,

laughing. ”lt was.terrib|e.” -

”See, you constantly hear a lot
of stuff like, ‘This label's interest-
ed in you, that label's interested‘

in you, this bahd wants to tour ‘
with you,’ ” said Ken. ”You hear ' I g
a lot of talk, but until it happens, 

you can't be sure.” C

‘ Coal industry challenges government

 AssocIA1En

As part of a broad campaign
against acid rain legislation, the
U.S. coal industry is challenging
the federal government's analysis

 of national coal reserves, saying
3% there isn't as much of the cheap
fuel available as it claimed.

‘ It's an argument of centuries —
the federal government says there

Some things I wonder about
while wandering around campus

— This whole cafeteria bag-
checking scheme is ‘bothering
me. They take your bookbags,
’ but then shouldn't they take your

purses and your pants as well
when you go in? Seems to me
that a grain of salt or an artery
_from the roadkill du jour could be
easily concealed in one of these
items.

Fraternity Association (NOFA)

section, and what is its purpose?
Hey, I have a great idea. The
houses in south Oakland can

The fight is not as dull as it
sounds. A

Overshadowing the numbers is
the fact that the coal industry is
fighting hard to prevent any acid
rain legislation that would tough-
en the air pollution standards for
coal-burning power plants.

As part of its strategy, it is_ try-
ing to change the public —. and
especially congressional — per-

ception that coal is cheap and

abundant. The new message is:
coal is expensive to obtain and
additional clean air regulations
will only raise that cost to
everyone.

As part of the message, the Na-
tional Coal" Council has written a
report challenging the Energy In-
formation Administration’s anal-
ysis of coal reserves.

it, SOFA. The sororities in Amos
Hall can form the Amos Hall
Sorority Organization (AHSO).
Then all the guys on the hill can
get together for the Organization
of Fraternities on Upper Campus
(OFUC). That would save some
hassles, there only being three
fraternities and one sorority. They
could all have the same motto as
well, ”Reallyos Dumbus," or in
modern English, ”Let’s all form
petty little groups among our-
selves so_that we can weaken
even more the already not very
cohesive Pitt Greek system.” I bet
they'd have some big parties,
though. ‘

At a Senate committee hearing
Sept. 18, NCC officials said the
government's estimate overlooks
many obstacles to mining coal.
They said economic conditions,
environmental laws, geology and
market demands are harsher than
is generally understood.

As a result, NCC says the
government's claim that there are
244 billion tons of minable coal
in the U.S. is too high. The coal
group says the real figure is closer
to 170 billion tons-.

Sen. Wendell Ford, D—Ky. and
a coal advocate, told the Senate
Subcommittee on Mineral
Resources Development and
Production that overestimating
the coal supply would only en-
courage acid rain legislation.

”And acid rain legislation
would impose billions in addi-

by a person very prominent in the

the Panthers to be at WVU. How

though. Spring concerts seem to
be the big thing on many cam-

He said too many congressmen
believe the acid rain problem
would go away if industry shift-
ed to burning low-sulfur coal that
is available in the West. Acid rain
legislation would push many in-
dustries into shifting to the clean-
er fuel. 4

~ Ford, who represents a state

with large deposits of high-sulfur_

coal, said there is less low-sulfur
fuel than people think.

”The National Coal Council
has demonstrated the available
reserve is considerably smaller
than believed,” Ford said.

Any attempt to forestall respon-
sive, responsible legislation on
acid rain should be looked upon
with disdain.

Checkingyour trousers at the door

— Well raise mah tuition! How,
about the university taking away
the existing tennis courts to build
new ones up near the fraternities,
and takingaway the dirt fields
that many of us use for intramural
sports in order to build another
parking lot. It’s not like we need
any more concrete around this
campus anyway, and where will
we play softball next year? An-
swer -— we won’t. A

may go on strike, too. Next thing

The Gulf and necessary defense

DAVID

Until it was announced that the
No. '2 source ofAmerican import
oil came from Iran, there were
those people- and columnists
denouncing United States
presence in the Persian Gulf.

Further, when American
helicopters attacked an Iranian

I vessel endangering international

safety by dropping mines into the
waters, those same columnists
began’ their cries_.of outrage.
But one must wond_er.
Besides our own oil interests,

is involved in the Gulf? Didn't
our first president, the unani-
mously elected ‘George Washing-

not take interest in international
affairs? '
Indeed, he did. But the world

When the folks at RJR Nabisco
emerged from their bunkers last
week to announce yet another
breakthrough product, I felt a per-

‘ verse rush of admiration. How do

they keep doing it?

The health community has
been slogging through the
trenches in the war against smok-
ing, chipping away the number of
addicts, backing them into a
small, socially unacceptable "cor-
ral, and out comes RJR with a

' secret offensive weapon. It's the

smoking industry's Battle of the
Bulge: the ”smoke|ess” cigarette.

The product they are develop-
ing is, they say, a cigarette that
uses but does not burn tobacco.

It's a cigarette that produces ‘no _

ash and little sidestream smoke.
In short, the-‘product is_supposed-

  

Gay‘ dropped the bomb on
Hiroshima, the world has never
been the same.

Like it or not, the United States,
in a little more than three short
years, became the most powerful
nation on the face of the earth.
Winston Churchill addressed
America on Thanksgiving, 1944,
saying our military might was
subject for ”profound thanks-
giving.”

Winston Churchill had to

' -watch as his nation, the country

that under the leadership of
Neville Chamberlain took an in-
terest in the German invasion of
Poland in 1939, made way for
the new world powers.
Britain's safety was certainly
not jeopardized when it, as the
so-called ”protectorate of the
world,” stepped in to help
Poland. (Hitler considered, ini-
tially, the British as part of the
Aryan race.) But the British
stepped in to help Poland, to use
its military might to bring the
downfall "of the Third Reich.
And there are those American
citizens who are not grateful for
the strength their country has.
They say the United States has no
right to reflag Kuwaiti ships. They
say those other countries ship-

ping fuel from that area should '

protect their own interests them-
selves. '

What should the United States
do? Should we let the nations of
the world whose primary oil
sources come from the Gulf look
out for themselves? _

If their ships are sunk, if their

smoke in

never exhaled by a tobacco man.
To say the word ”safer” would
imply that regular cigarettes were
unsafe. They call it, instead, ”the
world's cleanest cigarette.”

The announcement is a re-
sponse to the success of the pa-
sive smoking movement, which
has made smokers into social
pariahs. Ifthese new pacifiers do
save some beds from burning and
some non-smokers’ lungs from
deteriorating, it's all for the good.
But I suspect that we're actually
inhaling a lethal sidesream of
false health promises to‘ the
smokers.

The history of tobacco’s safety
claims is hardly reassuring. The
cigarette itself was marketed at
the turn of the century as a
healthy, “safer” alternative to
chewing tobacco, which spread
germs through spitting. In the

' 19305, ads for Camels and Phil- .

lip Morris boasted ‘that their
smoke was less irritating, i.e.,
”safer.” In the 1950s, after the
first major cancer scare, the in-
dustry developed filtered
cigarettes with slogans _like ’’just
what the doctor ordered.” It
turned out that one of the things
the doctor ordered was asbestos‘
in the Kent micronite filter.

Today, manufacturers push. the
notion of low tar in an attempt to
convince people that their brand

is ”safer.” And to come full ci'r_-.

cle ‘- iqung. people} are again-in-

  

fuels are denied, what can the
United States, the most powerful
nation of the free world, say to
those attacked countries whom
we consider to be our allies?

Can America afford to neglect
our allies’ interests while protect-
ing our own?

Many Americans are complain-
ingabout our postwar role as the
protectorate of the free world. Its
almost a sort of self-centeredness
peoplehave, thinking if it doesn't
happen in this country (or maybe
even in Pittsburgh) then it doesn't
have any relevance to their lives.

There are those Americans
who wish we would neglect the
rest of the world. There is, of
course, the great fear any nation
has of war. Their fear of war is
certainly justifiable. I

But there are possible ways to
help prevent a war? Could the na-
tions receiving fuels vital for in-
dustrial economies form ’a sort of

alliance among themselves to

prevent a war?‘

Could the United States with
the other nations in the waters
possibly create a NATO or
SEATO for the Persian Gulf
where each protect the other in
the advent of an attack or a mine
hit?

Or will this nation have to use
its arsenal of democracy with
force to prevent the Middle
Eastern petroleum producing
powers from injuring those who
have joined with us in other hard
times, creating NATO and
SEATO to protect one another in
the advent of communist attack?

safetY'S direction I 

pany marketing a new ice cream, I
I saying that it has no calories, not‘ ;

gesting tobacco, like Skoal, in the
misguided belief that it’s less dan-
gerous than inhaling. All in ‘all,
the ”safety” record of the tobac-
co industry now leads to some
350,000 deaths a year.

So what of this new unburnt
offering to the public anxiety?
Greg Connolly, director of the
Massachusetts Office of Non-
Smoking and Health, likes to call
it ”the little Webber grill.” We
know that this grill produces car-
bon monoxide and nicotine. We
know that it contains charcoal, a
small amount of tobacco and
something mysteriously called a
’’flavor capsule.” Essentially, you
suck hot air through that capsule.

Is that safer? I mean, ”c|eaner”?
The carbon monoxide and the
nicotine are bad enough for the
heart. But the real mystery is in
the ’’flavor capsule.”

The flavor in a cigarette comes
from the tar in tobacco. As you
take the tar out, you have to sub-
stitute something. In a cigarette
with as little tobacco as these, the
flavor packet is a bundle of addi-
tives. But what they are, how
dangerous, or how dangerous
when burned with other additives
is anybody’s guess because
tobacco is a uniquely unregulat-
ed product. It is exempt from con-

The new crew has most of the
same characteristics of the old
crew, but they are displayed
differently and through very
different characters.

The captain, Jean—Luc Picard, is
portrayed by British actor Patrick
Stewart. He is a lot older and a
lot less intense than we remem-
berjim to be.

It seems that the character of

‘ Kirk was split into two different

characters in the new show, with
Picard being the actual com-
mander, and First Lt. Ryker tak-
ing over Jim's studly duties of
getting laid on every episode.

The rest of this crew is some-
what of a joke compared to
Spock, Bones, Sulu and the rest.
There is a Klingon on a Federa-
tion ship now, and he is even a
lieutenant, given great responsi-
bility on the ship. .

The security officer is Lt. Yar,
and -what she needs more than
anything is to take a valium. She
is. trigger happy and less than
level-headed. Spock's duties have
also been split between two
characters. One is an android
who pilots the ship and is like a
walking encyclopedia, and the
other is a female who, unlike
Spock, can show emotion that
she senses from her surroundings.
Finally, LeVar Burton plays Geor-
di LaForge, a blind man who uses
a painted hair clip to see as well
as pilot this huge vessel.

I won't tell you the actual plot,
but I will tell you that it is some-
what‘ confusing to follow. Unlike
the old Trek shows, where the
problem was‘. presented and was
evident within the first few
minutes, it took a while to" figure
out what was going on up there.

This show. is very reminiscent
of ' the first movie, where the
directors seemed more worried
that the viewers be dazzled by
the special effects and were not
really emphasizing the story
lines. This is one area where the
new shows will be better,
however, because the special ef-
fects are being taken care of by
George Lucas of Star Wars fame.

It wasn't as good as the origi-
nal, but then, what is? I suggest
you take a look anyway. It wasn't
as bad as I may have made it
sound. I guess it's better than see-
ing the Captain Pike or Harvey
Mudd shows for the 100th time.

Wednesday, September 30, T987‘  if

By Thomas [)anyluk ‘

Sta ff Writer

The summer has passed, but
the Pitt offense hasn't. It's still just
running around for some reason.
— Sure, tailback—at-large Craig
Heyward has been averaging 4.9
yards per carry. Given he's

broken some bigvruns for the Pan-.

thers this season, some of them
going for touchdowns. And yes
indeed, Heyward leads the team
in rushing with an impressive 537
yards. The guy is havinga heck-
uva season. ' ’_

But now look at the flip side of
the offense, and you see there
really is none.

Whether Pitt fans realize it or
not, something is radically wrong
with what the Panthers are doing
with the football — and it's not
necessarily the players on -that
side of scrimmage. .

It seems that the playcalling,
especially in the Saturday's game
at West Virginia, has left many
touchdowns unscored and many
more yards to be desired.

Granted it's been a long time,
so let me refresh your memory
and present exactly what the
1987 Panthers have to work with
in the fine art of scoring points

.(which is, of course, the reason
the good Lord created offenses in
the‘ first place). ’

At wide receiver, there is the
fleet Hosea Heard, Billy Osborn,
the fleet Henry Tuten, Michael
Stewart and the fleet Reggie Wil-
liams, not to mention an array of
part-time tight ends —.all capable
of ”getting open” and catching
the football, as they've proven
when provided the opportunity.
Simple as that.

At running back, there is the
surprise sophomore Adam Walk-
er, who has shown — and I use
the term without reservation —'
flashes of brilliance in the bits
and pieces of playing time that

yards, and many of his attempts
were directed toward the side-
lines instead of attacking the
Mountaineer defense through the
gut of the field.

In other words, Gottfried was
content to battle West Virginia on
the width of the turf instead of
spreading the fight from end zone
to end zone where the receiver
could do more damage. The re-
sult was a bland 6-3 win for Pitt,
but one which, if it weren't for a
solid defensive showing by the
Panthers, could easily have went

the other way.

It seems that Pitt has insisted on
trying to operate the conserva-
tive, (ouch) Penn State system -
hand the pigskin off to the best
running back and turn him loose.
Run off tackle, run up the middle,
run the sweeps, then pass on oc-
casion to mix it up somewhat.
That's called setting up the pass
with the run — the conservative
Republican approach, with only
one candidate in the running.

But the Panthers haven't really
proven that they are fundamen-

, tally sound enough to beat teams

with ball control alone. Their
strength lies in all the skill posi-

Riley doesn't mind the loneliness of sport I

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

”The loneliness of the long dis-
tance runner” is what Pitt wom-
en's cross country No. 1 runner,
Debbie Riley, likes best about the
sport.

”Running is a very indepen-
dent sport,” said Riley. ”That’s
probably why I like it so much.
You don't depend on anyone but
yourself. Of course, your perfor-
mance affects the team’s perfor-
mance, and that is a good
motivating factor.”

y, September 30, 1987

Riley, who is a senior, receives
a good deal of motivation from
her teammates, as they are a
close-knit pack this year, with
only 1:01 separating the first and
the fifth finishing runners.

With the first and fifth runners
finishing so closely, Riley will
have to fight to keep her No. 1
ranking this year, but according
to women's cross country coach
John Vasvary, this doesn't bother
Riley.

”Riley will have to fight to
maintain her No. 1 position this
year,” said Vasvary. ”She is hap-

Siragusa projects his thoughts for weekend

By Sam Tallarico

Assistant Sports Editor

For the past two weeks, it
seems some people feel the Pan-
ther offense has vanished with

 ' ..the good chance of never
_ returning.

Pitt tackle Tony Siragusa would
never agree with that; in fact, he's
looking forward to Saturday's
game with Boston College.

’’I think it will be a great game
offensively and defensively. ,

”Sal [Genillaj and Craig [Hey-

Iward] will take the challenge. Af-

ter last week, there were doubts,

but I know what they can do,”
Siragusa added.

Last week against West Vir-
ginia, Genilla passed for only 72
yards (seven completions in 18
attempts), and Heyward averaged
3.5 yards per carry, not exactly
their type of numbers.

”Any win is a good win.
Games like that [West Virginia],
you've got to be able to win. It
was a record crowd,‘and it was
important for us,” said Gottfried.
”Anytime you can win on the
road, it's a good win.

But this week's game will be at
home and against a powerful

Boston College team, despite the
fact they have lost its last two
games.

”Boston College is good offen-
sively,” said'Siragusa. ”They’re
known for their passing, but they
are a well balanced team.”

But that shouldn't pose too big
a problem for Siragusa, the
6—foot—5, 270-pound junior from
Kenilworth, N.J. Last season, he
recorded 78 tackles and seven
sacks in only nine games.

This season, Siragusa has 30
tackles, four hurries, caused one
fumble, recovered two fumbles
and has one sack through four
games.

With these kind of numbers,

. Panther fans aren't the only ones

who know what Tony Siragusa
can do.

He's been named fifth—team
All-America by The Football
News and selected All-East by
The Sporting News, Street and
Smith's College Football Year-
book and Athlon.

But that was then, this is now.
Teams feel they may be able to
have some success against Pitt by
running the ball.

”Since the second half of the
Temple game, a lot ofteams have
run on us. I think the defensive
line will find it a challenge.’’

But the real test may come

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 30, T987

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ The
Pittsburgh Pirates plan to mark
the 15th anniversary of Rober-
to Clemente’s 3,000th hit with
a scoreboard tribute before
their Wednesday night game
against the Chicago Cubs.

Clemente, the Pirates’ Hall
of Fame right fielder, doubled
to left field against New York
Mets’ pitcher Jon lvlatlack on
Sept. 30, 1972, for his
3,000th, and final, regular-
season hit. It also was his last
hit at Three Rivers Stadium.

’’I dedicate this hit to the
fans of Pittsburgh,” Clemente

Clemente to be
remembered tonight

said. ”They have made it won-
deduL”

Clemente had four hits
against the Cincinnati Reds
during the National League
playoffs, which the Reds won
3-2. Clemente died Dec. 31,
1972, when a plane loaded
with relief supplies for
Nicaraguan earthquake vic-
tims crashed shortly after
takeoff.

Roberto Clemente Jr., one of
Clemente’s three sons, is
scheduled to throw out the
first pitch before the Pirates-
Cubs game.

requirement that a runner who
wanted to compete in the-cross
country program had to compete

in the track program as well.

Riley, who had not run track in
high school, doubted her ability
to compete in the sport. She
could not run cross country
without running track. Not want-
ing to run track, Riley sat out the
whole year.

The following year, Riley

talked with Vasvary again. His
rules hadn't changed, and .she
still didn't want to run track. The
crucial difference this year was

that Vasvary convinced Riley to

give track a try. And so she did.

It was a pleasant surprise for
Riley when she was quite succes-
ful running track. At the Big East
Outdoor Championships last
spring, she finished sixth in both
the 5,000— and l0,000—meter

races.

This gave Riley a lot of confi-
dence and a thought in the back
of her mind that it was possible
to be the No. 1 runner for the
women's cross country team this
season.

. ”After I did well on track, I was
really excited about the cross
country season,” said Riley. ’’I
didn't think realistically that I

 

could be the No. 1 runner this
season, but somewhere in the
back of my mind, I held the be-
lief that ifl put enough hard work
in over the summer that it was a
possibility.” '

That possibility became a real-
ity for Riley. I

The toughest meet she will en-
counter this year will be the Big
East Championships on Oct. 24
in Boston.

is_ that the atheltic department
doesn't think as highly of the
women's cross country program

Riley. ”We may not be a
revenue-producing sport, but we
are going out there and represent-
ing Pitt just as the revenue-
producing sports do. We work
just as hard as the basketball play-
ers do, and we deserve recog-
nition.”

How .

Can You

Worship I
in Silence?

He entered the church and sat
in silence. In the encompassing
quiet, as the petty cares of the
day dropped away, he sought
to reach God directly. Another
seeker rose and spoke of love,
of human cruelty and injustice,
of Jesus, of other peacemakers,
of things she was deeply moved
to say out of her sense, of com-
munion with God. His mind
enfolded the words, and in the
following reverential stillness
his thoughts cleared, his con-
victions strengthened, his un-

derstanding deepened.

And afterwards, everyone.
shook hands.

There was no creed, no priest
or minister, no prearranged or-
der of service. Every Quaker
meeting for worship is a quiet
search for the peace of mind to
hear the ‘message of that still
small voice within.

Do you, too, suspect that there
may be something of God
within every person - includ-
ing you? If so, perhaps the be-
Iiefs of the Friends will be
useful to you. We have some
quite readable leaflets available
without obligation. Just use the
