, If Ify Mkparu hopes to meet her:

parents’ expectations, she’ll need
to get married soon. A pharmacy
school student at Duquesne Uni-
versity, Mkparu is from "Nigeria,

and she wants to marry another '

Nigerian.

“It’s typical to marry around my
age. Usually women marry as soon
as _they’re done with school,” the
23-year-old, ﬁfth-year pharmacy
student said. .

Mkparu said‘ it’s been limiting
and difficult to ﬁnd suitable part-
ners, but with a new dating and
networking website that was de-
veloped by a Pitt student, Mkparu

_ hopes to connect to more potential

husbands.

Pitt senior Jack Nutugah
launched myafricanconnect.com,
a datingand networking site for
Africans living abroad in the U.-S.
and ‘Canada, just this past weekend.
Africans often prefer to date and
marry within their nationality, buts
ﬁnding .dating and marriage part-
ners can be difficult if none or few
people from their country live in
the area.--Nutugah’s site aims to ease
this‘‘process. ' _.

Nutugah, who moved from

Ghana to the Philadelphia area in "

2002, said-the site allows users to

Vows of silence show oppressi

Amy Friedenberger
Senior Staf Writer

e SeniorNinaSiviystoodinfrontofthe
William Pitt Union Friday afternoon,
black electrical tape pressed ﬁrmly
across her lips. As people walked by,
she raised a sign that read “I Stand
For Those Who Are Silenced.”

‘About 25 students marched
around Pitt’s campus Friday after-
noon as part of the Day of Silence
“Breaking the Silence” rally to call
attention to the bullying and harass-
ment of members of the lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender and queer

' community. Rainbow Alliance, a
Pitt student group that promotes the
interests of the LGBTQ community,
organized the event.

The Day of Silence calls for people
to take avow of silence to represent
how LGBTQ students are often si-
lenced as a result of being bullied
and harassed.

Rainbow Alliance president

James. Weaver said only a couple

people vowed to be silent for the
whole day, but a few more took
shorter vows of silence. '
Rainbow Alliance Vice President
Dylan Drobish said that when those
not participating see the tape over

the mouth of someone taking the -

vow of silence, they see how hard it
can be to reach out to those who feel
like they can’t speak because they are
being bullied. _ _ '

Drobish showed up to the rally
with a fake black eye and bruises
around his body to represent the
physical violence that people have
sometimes been inﬂicted with be-
cause of their sexuality or gender
identity.

At 4 p.m., the students broke the
silence by leading a march around
lower campus.

“It’s a way for everyone to sym-

» bolically and physically break the

silence,” said Tricia Dougherty,
Rainbow Alliance’s political action
chair. '

Students met in front of the‘

Union, then marched through Litch-

ﬁeld Towers, down Forbes Avenue,
through Schenley Plazaand around
the Cathedral of Learning.

“We’ve been silentall day, and
now it’s time to get loud,” Dougherty

- shouted through a megaphone.

They shouted chants such as,
“Hey, hey, ho, ho, homophobia’s

0 got to go,” “Two, four, six, eight,]e-

sus cannot make you straight” and
“Two, four, six, eight, are you sure
your roommate’s straight?” _ .

Some people turned their heads,
and one older woman said that the
students should be spending more
time studying. ~

After returning to the Union, the
participants wrote adjectives on a
balloon that, described their emo-
tions during a time they felt they
were being silenced. Words such as
“spiteful,” “powerless,” “oppressed”
and “depressed” covered the two

yellow balloons before they wer —
.released into the air. , A ‘

on of LGBTQiyO.11th

organization that focuseson ensur-

ing safe school environments forall ‘ .

students, regardless of their sexual
orientation or gender identity.
According to a 2009 GLSEN
National School Climate Survey of
high school students, nine out of
10‘LGBTQ students experienced

- harassment at school, three-ﬁﬁzhs

felt unsafe at schoolbecause of their

sexual orientation and about one— ‘

third have skipped a day of school
in the past month because of feeling
unsafe. - - ' T ' '

A ‘While GLSEN focuses on high
schools, Weaver said that Rainbow
Alliance puts on the event because

bullying does not stop when stu— V

dents leave high school.

“I think that a lot of students
sometimes forget that bullying still
goes on,” Weaver said. '

Melissa Tabak, the executive
assistant of Rainbow Alliance, said
that it’s difﬁcultto assess whether an
entire campus community is “gay-
friendly” or not. ' * -

“You ﬁnd people who are sup-

/

portive of the LGBTQ community,
and sometimes you ﬁnd the one or
twowho aren’t,” Tabak said.

Tabak said that early in the

morning, someone came up to the
table that Rainbow Alliarnce had set
up-in front of the Union, ripped up
a ﬂier and walked away. _ .

V ' “I would say that there are a lo
of people on Pitt’s campus who are
gay-friendly, but I wouldn’t neces-
sarily say the entire campus is gay-
friendly,” Tabak said. 4' ,

“People are ﬁne with the LGBTQ

community if it’s silent, but when we A

do something that attracts attention,
then there is sometimes a negative
reaction,” Weaver said.

About five people from Campus
Women’s Organization showed up
in_support of the march. T _

,Tracey.Hickey, ofﬁce adminis-
trator for CWO, said that the orga-
nizatiqn often works with Rainbow

‘Alliance because LGBTQ issues are ,
tied with the goals of feminism.

“No one is free while anyone is

oppressed,” she said.

Endowment fund among new president’sp goals

GPSA 4 1

. When it was Hungwe’s turn to speak, he
started by thanking Devanath forwhat she had
done during her presidency, highlighting her
efforts, to ﬁght Gov. To_m Corbett’s proposed
cuts to education ﬁinding, as well as her work

in opposition to the Port Authority’s decision ,

to cut bus routes.

“You stomped your foot -— size six —— and
said ‘Wait. Stop it,”’ he said. .

Hungwe said after the ceremony that he
plans to continue with the steps Devanath has
already taken to prevent the proposed budget
cuts, like emphasizing Pitt Day in Harrisburg
and the letter-writing campaigns.

Although Devanathwill notbe on the Board
next year —— as a second-year medical stu-
dent, she said she’ll be too busy — she said
she will continue her relationship with GPSA

7 “‘peripherally.” A

Part of that planned involvement includes
teaching the new board “tips, tricks and what
it means to lobby,” she said.

“There can be so many little roadblocks.
If you’ve never run into them before, you’1l
run into all of them,” she said, referring to
newcomers to the process of advocating for the
University’s 10,000 graduate students.

Devanath will continue in her position as
the chairwoman of Pitt’s Student Government
Council untiljune, when the council will have

its elections, and shewill maintain her position
as the Northeast regional vice president of the
National Association of Graduate-Professional
Students until December. ‘ l
G. Reynolds “Renny” Clark, Pitt’s vice chan-

cellor for community initiatives and chief of '

staff, also lauded Devanath’s efforts.
“You took the word ‘professionalism’ and

Nyasha Hungwe:

graduate school alumni.
The endowment planwould use donations
from current students and alumni, creating
. an additional source of ﬁmding for graduate
_ students. Currently, GPSA relies on- the stu-
dent activities fee, which is $20 per graduat
student each semester. .'
Hungwe called this an “alternative to ask-

You stom ed your foot '— size --
and said Wait. Stop it. ”

really made it the moniker of your organiza-
tion,” he said.
He added that the efforts of the outgoing

boardset Pitt apart from other universities’ ,

student governments in that it showed that
Pitt students really care about legislation that
affects them. “ .
Hungwe, asecond-year law student at Pitt,
detailed two of his long—term. plans for GPSA.
He hopes to create an endowment fund for

graduate students and improve relations with

ing the administration to raise the student

activities fee.” _ . _
Another one of his plans was to increase

relations between alumni and current stu-

V dents — he mentioned boosting networking

and mentoring programs and emphasized the
importance of the two. 4 '

“It’s about who you know’ and what you .
know — which, on top of academic priori-

A ties, is the tripartite approach to success,’’

To do that, Hungwe hopes to create an

alumni council, which would include an alum-

_ nus from each of Pitt’s graduate schools. He .
. said that both of these plans are long—term
and that it might take up to to years to reap .

their beneﬁts. -
Givens, whowas anadministrative assistant

for GPSA for two years,.also has plans for his

new roleas vice president of committees.
Givens, a religious studies doctoral stu-

. dent in Pitt’s School of Arts 8: Sciences, said a

he wants to increase communications between

’ students and the University, as well as update

the bylaws. . .
During the ceremony, Givens was in charge
of giving away presents to the outgoing Board

members. There were special gifts for De-

vanath." ,
Her going-away presents included a clock,
a business card holder and a pen _—— each rep-
resenting something special about her presi-

dency. ‘ .
_ Givens said the clock was a symbol of all

the time Devanath spentworking on GPSA, the ’

business card holder showed how she “ramped
up the professionalism” of the organization
and the pen represented all the times Devanath
stole pens from the GPSA office.

“I see pens, and.I take them,” Devanath.

_ also select their nationality from a list of 219

African countries.
There are many cultural differences in-

volving language, food and traditions be- ‘
‘ tween African regions that make Africans
' more inclined to date within their nationality,

Nutugah said, and it’s not uncommon for
Africans to return to their home countries
to date or get married. Long distance rela-
tionships are also typical in this scenario,

' but those can cause problems beyond the

distance aspect. _

“Sometimes you don’t know if that person
who you’re talking to has your best interest,
as in they really like you for who you are or
they just want to come to the United States,”
"he said. ‘

Nutugah has been working with the Union
of African Communities to promote the site.
The UAC is an organization that connects
and fosters development among Pittsburgh’s
and Allegheny County’s African communi-
ties. Rufus Idris, the secretary general of the

. UAC, said that samemationalitypmarriages

are deeply rooted in tradition, _ _

“In the African tradition, parents are very,
very_proud and most happy when they see
that their kids  are able to connect with

. someone from their country or village,” Id- -

ris said.

According to Idris, the traditiVonsfavored~
V by older generations and younger ones.

Younger Africans often feel more comfort-

able with someone of the same nationality,

too. Marriage itself is also a valued custom.
“[Remaini‘ng unmarried] is not that much

, of a welcomed practice in African culture,

because Africans believe so much in family,”
Idris said. “Sometimes the situation makes
you be single, but Africans love family. We_
cherish family.” '

: Nutugah began developing the site in
january. While in New York City this past
spring break, he was at a store _and picked
up a copy of African Abroad—USA, a newspa-

per for the African community living in the »
U.S., and read an article about the difficulty .

immigrant African women face in ﬁnding a
husband in the U.S.

“I saw it and I felt like, ‘Wow, this newspa- ' T

g per is actually speaking to me.’ It substanti-

ated what I had been working on for close to
three months,” he said. » . ‘ .
Nutugah held a website launch party
Saturday night at the Mellon Institute in
Oakland. About 40 people came out to sup-
port the project. Before Nutugah gave a pre-
sentation on the website, attendees took to

the dance ﬂoor. Light from a multi-colored_ ’

disco ball ﬁlled the room as a DJ played loud,

" upbeat African music. Afterward, Nutugah

spoke about the site and talked about re-
lationship diﬂiculties a- close relative of his’
experienced. , i s ’ ' 4. 5
Nutugah had a family member livingin the
U.S. who began dating a man living in Ghana.
The man later moved to the U.S. to be with

her, but soon after, the rélationship failed.
The distance, expenses and the complexity of
moving makes such relationships especially
difficult and painful when they don’t work
out, Nutugah said. _ .

“She spent a lot of money with the immi-

4 gration, with the plane ticket and the papers,”

he said. V
Pitt senior Clement Mokua, the operations

‘manager for myafricanconnectcom, said

that funding for the website had largely been

out of pocket, but its creators hope to have
African—run businesses, from restaurants
to clothing shops, advertise on the site to
promote the businesses as well as to gener-
ate funds; ‘

The site also aims to provide a networking,

idea and event—sharing forum. For example,
Africans in one state might discover a Kenyan
independence day celebration in another part
of the U.S., Mokua explained. That group

' could then start a similar celebration in their

5

Shared nationality plays role inmarriage

community. Nutugah said students coming

to the U.S. to study could use the site to ﬁnd

Africans’ in their area to help them adjust to

the new culture. . _

Duquesne senior Dorcas Dadzie said she
hopes to open an Africanrestaurant special-
izing in Ghanaian food, and the site could
help her promote it. '

‘-‘People don’t get a lot of African food. It’lll
. be a platform for me to advertise and to tell

people,” she said."  ‘

Are you

_:_pinions

procrastinating?

Is there something else you
should be doing right now?
This week is the home
stretch —— the beginning of two
weeks of final exams, papers

and projects to mark the end _

of the school year. For some,
the preparation for this began
a while ago, but for most of us,
the work is just beginning.

A University of Calgary
professor’s 2007 study found
that three out of four college
students consider themselves
procrastinators. That’s about
21,000 of us at Pitt who waste
time instead of actually doing
what we should be.

We th_ink we need to address
this epidemic of work-avoid-
ance. The NBC news program
“Today” reports on its website
that procrastination makes us
poorer, fatter andpunhealthier
— so here’s what we’ve found
to help us stay’ out of debt, out
of weight support groups and
not out of our minds.

1 -Don’t tackle a big project all
at once. It’s important to break
up larger tasks into small, man-

ageable chunks. We find that

when we accomplish easy, small
goals and cross tasks off our
lists, we feel better about the
work We’re doing and are en-
couraged to keep moving.
-Acknowledge the time of
day you are most productive.
Find a timewhen you’re least
distracted — when there’s
nothing on TV or when your

distracting roommate is sleep— _

ing -— and get to work. We find
that sticking to a consistent
work routine is the most effi-
cient way to get stuff done.
-Go easy on the alcohol.
Virginia Tech’s Alcohol Abuse
Prevention website outlines
some effects of alcohol that can
last days after heavy drinking,
such as less effective long-term
memory, shorter attention
span and inhibition of REM
sleep. Not being able to recall
information, stay on task or
get refreshing sleep is detri-
mental to any final exam score.

If you’re 21, go out for drinks
to celebrate, not to avoid your
work.

-Chomp on some sugar—free
gum. The Los Angeles Times
reported that a study at Baylor
College of Medicine suggests a
correlation between chewing
gum and good academic per-
formance. The study found that
students who chewed gum in
class while doing math home-
work and during tests increased
their standardizedmath test
scores by 3 percent and had
higher math grades than those
who didn’t chew gum. Teachers

"said the gum chewers seemed

to requirefewer breaks, sustain
attention longer and remain
quieter. We’re also fans of minty
or cinnamon—y freshness.
-Take care of yourself. If

you’re tired, dirty and wearing _

sweats all the time, we think you

need to get your act together. *

Get as much sleep as you can,
but limit your naps to 20 min-
utes — longer naps can cause
you to feel groggy for about
a half hour after waking. The
Guardian reports that drinking
coffee before a 20-minute nap
could cause one to feel more
alert upon waking, since caf-
feine takes about 20 to 30 min-
utes‘ to take effect. We recom-

mend counting backward from '

300 by threes when hitting the
sack —- following the unfamil-
iar pattern of numbers diverts
your attention from things that
could make you anxious. We’ve
also found that when we look
good, we feel good. Don’t for-
sake your beauty sleep, hygiene
or fashion sense just because
you’ve been busy — everyone
else has been, too.

We wish you a happy and
healthy next two weeks — re-
member that worrying about
working is probably worse

, than actually working. We hope

those 21,000 of you out there
get something accomplished
today. Finishreadiing this pa-

‘ per, and then go do something

productive. I

One of the most intimidating words
in the English language is “Shake-
speare.” — '

The Bard is rightly credited as
being one of the world’s best writ-
ers. There’s, a reason why “Intro to
Shakespeare” classes are offered and
“Intro. to Stephenie Meyer” classes
aren’t.

- The rub is that the English
language as he understood it 400
years ago can be difficult for us to
understand today. The commons
comment that language most un-
common is of greater than common
difficulty. ,

It doesn’t help that Shakespeare
is often presented in the popular
media and accepted by the popular
imagination as something sacred,
what George"Bernard Shaw referred
to as “Bardolatry.” And when Shake-
speare isn’t presented as sacred, he’s
caricatured as the exclusive domain
of extremely smart and nerdy people
who sit around in smoking jackets
making quips to one another in
plumy British accents, evenif they
happen to‘ be living in, say, Brad-
dock—upon—Monongahe1a.

The caricature is unfortunate

kespeare some love

and would no doubt be a shock to

Shakespeare. In Elizabethan times, ‘

the theater was considered a form of
-low and rude entertainment and was
strugglingto gain acceptance among
respectable folk. It was sort of like
the WrestleMania of its day; enter-
tainment for the common people,
who would go to the theater and lend
- performances an air of the British
House of Commons, being loud and
rowdy as the play went on.
Many plays of the time were
‘countercultural and controversial.
The English government occasion-
ally banned theater performances
for sedition and tried to keep a very
close eye on the playwrights. And
the theaters were crowded,-so much
so that they would be shut down as

a public health measure whenever --
' a plague appeared in London. If '

those who saw the world premiere of

“Hamlet” had British accents, they .

were natural accents , not accents
of affectation. '
Considering the audience he was
writing for, we can conclude that
Shakespeare wasn’t writing plays
for dramatic critics 400 years in the

And in an era inwhichthere was
a lot of competition between various

theater groups for the almighty shil- .
ling, the plays had to be accessible
to a wide audience. If they weren’t,
it wasn’t like there was “Ye Olde
National Endowment for the Arts”
to fund starving artists. The artists
just starved the old-fashioned way.
Shakespeare’s plays were meant to
be enjoyed, and this fact, so often
forgotten in our day and age, makes
his work much more accessible.

But don’t take my word for‘it.—i V

take Shakespeare’s. .
V» One thing that is often swept
under the rug by those who hold

Shakespeare sacred is that the Bard _ ‘ _

engages in not only slapstick humor,
but some humor that is downright
sophomoric. “As You Like It’,’ con-
tains all sorts ‘of raunchy lines and ’
sex jokes. Part of the fun in “A Mid-

nia falls in love with a guy who’s been
transformed into a donkey. “Henry
IV, Part 1” has Prince Hal, the future-
' King Henry V, conspire to commit
highway robbery with his drinking
buddies. V
Even the tragedieshave some
humor with wide appeal,_ from Po—‘ ’

Some of thestuff in Shakespeare
is so edgy that it made some people
uncomfortable to think of school-

children reading the actual plays.-

Thomas Bowdler famously pro-
ducedanexpurgated “Family Shake-
speare,” trimming away the bits that
couldn’t be read in polite company,
including theremoval of the implica-
tion that Ophelia’s death in Hamlet
was ,a suicide and the changing of
Lady Macbet_h’s “Out, damned spot”
to “Out, crimson spot.”gBowdler was
not the only one who wanted to
produce such an censored version.

Lewis Carroll wanted to produce one ..

too,but never published it.
Because Shakespeare wasn’t ex-
purgating himself, we can see that,

- in a way, he was trying to appeal at
least somewhat to the lowest com— .

mon denominator, the average Joe
the Groundling, if you will.
The general issues Shakespeare
‘addresses are also not uncommon
to our own time. There are issues of
divided loyalty, friendship, revenge,
greed, power, jealousy, race, ﬂattery,
senility, madness, murder, love, ha-
tred, reconciliation and gossip — all
of these no different in his time than
ours. Pitt Repertory Theatre’s excel-
lently modernized version of “As
You Like It” thatl had the pleasure

l to see this semester brought this
‘ ‘important realization home. Sure,
' the language can take some getting

used to, but given a solidly armotated
edition and some exposure, there is
no reason to feel afraid of or intimi-
dated by the Bard of Stratford.

THE s1AMA11AcK

Corbett’s cuts   partially justified

Nick Stamatakis

' “ Columnist

Student demonstrations. Ear-
nest pleas from state university
presidents. Dernonization of Gov.
Tom Corbett. All have made the
ﬁnal months of the semester par-
ticularly important in determin-

ing the future of the University’s»

funding. The Student Government
Board and student activists across
-campus have been pleading with
lawmakers not to cut Pitt’s state
appropriation. V V ' ' “
-These leaders are claiming that
the University has seen its appro-
priation drop for many years, and
any further cuts will leave admin-

esistratorsvno choice but to’-raise tu-s ' '

ition. School officials say they have
cut all the fat possible — Pitt has
gone as far as devoting a portion

— of its webpage to the University’s
efﬁciency and cost—cutting mea-

sures.

Yet hidden within this narrative
is another set of facts not found on
that website. Adjusted for inﬂa-
tion and enrollmentvchanges, Pitt

increased administrative spending *

126 percent from 1993 to 2007.
Penn State, another school facing
cuts, increased such spending by
151 percent. _ V '
This data comes from a 2010

Goldwater Institute report, which '

cited data from the U.S. Depart-

, ment of Education. Administra-

tive spending was deﬁned as any
spending not speciﬁcally directed
toward instruction, research and
service — and typically involved
funding for positions such as busi-
ness operations specialists, ﬁnan-
cial specialists, loan counselors
andmany others. — A

In comparison, the average
increase nationwide in adminis-

trative spending among the US

News & World Report top 100 col-
leges was 56.7 percent, and dur-

,ing the same period, Pitt raised
its teaching budget by a smaller
28.75 percent. The huge adminis- .

trative—spending increases by the
two Pennsylvania schools were not

' only above the national mean, but

also rank near the top of the list

near elite schools like Duke, MIT‘

and Boston College.

The numbers present an inter-
esting foil to the narrative supplied
by the school administration.

While University officials credit '

the school’s diminishing state ap-

propriation — a 9.6 percent abso-

e-mail.

Plus, as noted by Fedele, “In
1993, the ﬁrst year cited by the
study, research expenses at Pitt
-were $156 million; last year, they
were $737 million, more than a
£70 percent increase from 1993.”
This explosion in new research

did require more management to

handle recruitment, organization
and research support. .
Yet even taking this into con-
sideration, Pitt still increased
administration more than did the
average university. The Center for
Measuring University Performance
shows that from 1996 to 2007, Pitt
ranked in the top third of schools

Gov. Corbett’s cuts just might
represent a significant enough‘
change to control administrative.
spending at the University.  

lute drop since 1993, adjusted for

inﬂation -4 for rising tuition in
the past, the blame might equally
be shared by the University’s. in-
creased spending for these non-
core, administrative functions.
Some of this increase does have
merit, as well as a simple explana-
tion. As universities transferred
from paper to electronic infor-
mation systems," many clerical
employees who once ﬁlled ﬁle-
clerk roles and secretary posi-
tions switched to administrative
roles. Accordingly, their salaries
switched from the clerical column
to the administrative column in

' budget numbers reported to the

Department of Education, Pitt
spokesmanjohn Fedele said in an

\

for increasing administrative V

spending in relation to increasing
research spending, and Penn State
ranked even higher. To compare,
Ohio State University saw a similar
size jump in research spending yet
only increased its administrative
spending by about 40 percent.

V It is important to note that most
of these jobs and salaries typically
aren’t completely wasteful, and
that the school administration
isn’t being deceitful. After all, all
universities have shown massive
increases in administrative spend-
ing primarily due to the nature of
college funding. As noted by Rob-
ert Martin, a retired Centre Col-
lege professor, in his paper, “The
Revenue—to—Cost Spiral,” universi-

ties simply don’t have an incentive
to minimize cost, In the private
sector, costs are minimized in an
effort to lower prices and increase
demand, but in the university sys-
tem, demand doesn’t decrease with
higher tuition or rise with lower tu-
ition. Furthermore, colleges need
to demonstrate a need to earn fed-

eral and charitable funding. They.
therefore risk earning less if costs -

are too controlled and there isn’t
urgency.
In many ways, the administra-

‘ tive increase reﬂects a similar situ-

ation in health care, another in-
dustry with a skewed demand/cost

‘relationship. In fact, the inﬂation-

adjusted costs of dentistry have
risen almost equally with those of
higher education since the. 1970s,

, and much of this is attributable

to high overhead costs from of-
ﬁce staff, which can often eat up 25
percent of revenue. Yet just as with
higher education spending, there
isn’t a huge push to make practices
more efficient because people can
tolerate paying higharnounts to go
to the dentist.

Gov. Corbett’s cuts just might
represent a signiﬁcant enough

change to control administrative

spending at the University. While

the initial proposed cuts were ~

probably beyond administrative
bloat, the smaller cuts currently
being suggested might improve
the efﬁciency of the University.
Pitt and Penn State both led the
country in/terms of ‘administra-
tive increases until at least 2007,
after all, so hopefully new focus
will make it possible for the univer-
sities to lead the country in terms

of administrative decreases over

the next 10 years.

Nation slity rooms celebrate I culture with food and dance

Skylar Wilcox
Staﬁ'Wri ter

Sporting black pants and gold
necklaces and coins, Pittsburgh’s
Grecian Odyssey Dancers per-
formed the Kalamatiano, the
national dance of Greece, as on-
lookers munched on hummus and
sipped sangria in the Cathedral of
Learning Saturday night.

More than 100 community
members celebrated the 70th
anniversaries of both the Syria-
Lebanon and Greek nationality
rooms on Saturday by holding a
banquet and awards ceremony
with dancers for entertainment.
Both rooms are located on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor of the Cathedral, but serve as

more than classrooms. This year,
various nationality room commit-
tees awarded 43 scholarships to
students doing research abroad
this year. v

The Syria—Lebanon room com-
mittee awarded its scholarship
to Margaret O’Brien, a graduate
student in Pitt’s School of Public

— and International Affairs. She will

study how the Syrian government
has been handling the huge num-
bers of Christian refugees ﬂeeing to
the country from Iraq. The Greek
nationality room committee did
not award any scholarships this
year.

In addition to traditional pita
and hummus, both rooms offered
ethnic dancing groups. Our Lady of
Victory Dancers performed Leba-

nese dances in costumes of green,

red and black, the national colors

of Lebanon. The Grecian Odyssey ‘

Dancers, a Pittsburgh group, took
viewers “on an Odyssey through
Greece and its dances,” director
Mary Doreza said.

E. Maxine Bruhns, director of
the nationality rooms, said that
this event served two purposes:
bringing Pittsburgh’s ethnic com-
munities together and celebrating
the contributions the nationality
room program has made to aca-

vdemics at the University. Since

1948, the various rooms have
awarded more than $2 million in
the form of more than 1,000 indi-
vidual scholarships-

At a time of great political tur-

moil in the Middle East, Edward '

LesoonJr., chairman of the Syria-
Lebanon room, said formal com-

munity gatherings like this one are
increasingly important.

“The Middle East is going
through a very sensitive time. If
we can come together in a formal
setting "and share our music, our
dance and our culture, it can show
the people of Pittsburg ” that the
region has a rich history and unity,
Lesoon said.

The Mediterranean countries
have more in common than their
nationality room anniversaries,
said Pennie Hareras, the chair-
woman of the Greek Nationality
Room Committee.

“Syria, Lebanon and Greece
have very similar cultures, re-
ligious beliefs, food, dance and
music, so this event is a nice ﬁt
for us,” she said.

Speaking at the event, Bruhns

implored students to seize “this
incredible opportunity and see
the world.” Other speakers at the
event stressed that connecting
youth to‘the culture of their home
countries is vitally important in
keeping the spirit of the nationality
rooms alive. Traditions can serve
as a “security blanket of culture
[people] should never let go of,”
Lesoon said.

Lesoon is part ofthe second
generation in his family to chair
the Syria‘-Lebanon room. Born to
a Syrian mother and a Lebanese
father, Lesoon’s family_ seems a
natural ﬁt for the room. But the
history of the room is also tied to
his family’s own history. A

Gallery aidsthree craft makers on art journeys

One local gallery is trying to help

artists who stand on the bridge be-

tween obscurity and fame.
The_Society for Contemporary

— -1 Craft-enalsmallman Streetiis one «

of the only museums dedicated

entirely to crafts in the Steel City. 4

They display what the center calls
“craft media,” which encompasses
almost all arts except paintings

and photography and is made

with materials such as clay, wood,
ﬁber, glass and metals, said Kati
Fishbein, exhibitions coordinator
for the SCC. '
“We really try to show craft art-
ists from around the world who

are technically skilled,” Fishbein

said. A 1

The Bridge Exhibition Series,
now in its 11th installment, began
in 1988 and takes place every two
years at‘ the gallery and features
artists throughout the nation. The
exhibitions display the_works of
people in the middle of their ca-
reer. T — ' _

“They may not be.-‘very well-
known, but they’re past the emerg-
ing stage,” Fishbein said. “They
have a solid background and body
of work. So these shows celebrate
artists in the middle of their ca-
reer.”

This year’s Bridge exhibit fea-
tures about 30 to 40 pieces cre-

- ated by three artists invited to the _

exhibition by the SCC.
One of the three craft makers
is 34-year-old Anne Drew Potter,

an artist who began working with ,

ceramics _as a young child.
ePotter has a ﬁgurative instal-
lation on display composed of 16
sculpted ceramic ﬁgures. Most of
the ﬁgures seem to be talking at the
same time in one circle, while an-
otherﬁgure sits alone to the side.
The piece is meant to deal with
the idea of individual versus group
identity, Potter said. . - ‘
“The art is representational,”

she said. “There’s recognizable im-
agery and they look human. But
they’re ambiguous, too. You can’t
tell what gender or age or race they
may be. So the people are both rec-
ognizable and not recognizable.”

This sort of distortion in image -

as well as the theme of isolation
versus inclusion are attributes of
most of Potter’s work, the artist
said. V

“It goes down to my interpre-
tation of how we deal with the
identity of self and how we rely on
ourselves, but we also rely a lot on
group dialogue and conversation of
the outside world to try to structure
our understanding,” she said. “We

- need-to have asense ofbelonging, ‘
but we need to have a self of self-

ness from our own bodies. So indi-
vidual versus group identity is just
an inherent tension.” '

While Potter is looking for
viewers to interpret her message,
68-year-old Lia Cook is looking to
get feedback.

“I just want a response,” Cook

said about her artwork. “I’m listen- .

ing. I’m very interested in hearing
from people.” '

.Cook mostly works with ﬁbers‘
and weaves artwork out of the ma-
terial. Bridge 11 features a series
of woven canvases of various sizes
that resemble photographic faces.

Some images are clearer than oth- -

ers, but they are all the result of a

combination ofmodern looms run ,

by computers and Cook’s ability
to create and alter the images in
Photoshop. _
Cook has worked with various
art techniques since the 1970s.
She originally dabbled in-paint-
ing, sculpting and photography

before discovering an interest in

weaving after a‘ trip to Mexico. Over
the years, she has found that the
human touch is a subject appeals
to her. _

“I’m really interested in the
hand,” Cook said. “There’s a lot

of things about hand-made now‘

[in our culture], but what about
the hand itself? What does the evi-
dence of the hand -made bring to
our experience?”

With this in mind, Cook cre-
ates pieces that have “depth” and
pieces that people wantyto touch,
she said. There’s no agenda behind
her works beyond curiosity for the
responses people will have.

“Everything is more personal,”
she said. “I’m not interested in tell-

ing anyone a story. I’m interested

in people’s associations with their

own personal stories.”

The ﬁnal artist, Mariko Kusu-
moto, has a number of smaller piec-
es made from various metals and
woods on display at the SCC gallery.
Kusumoto’s style employs tradi-
tionaljapanese forms and adds in
Western inﬂuences, which‘ leads to
the creation of objects such as small

S teapots or Japanese doll displays

with Western images or symbols.
Many of her collapsible pieces are
similar to a pop-up books -— if

Anne Drew Potter’s ceramic work features human—like sculptures all talking at one another in a circle with
one left out, to make a statement about community and self."-

examined closely, more and more
components of the pieces become
visible. One of the pieces, a box
shaped like a house, opens to ex-
pose numerous carvings of images
such as people and birds. .
Cook feels that the way. the
gallery is set up — leaving a lot of

room between the pieces — helps '

display the three different artists’
work well. - .

“You can walk around,” she said.
“There’s space. You can see things

from multiple angles and engage _

inthem.”

All of the pieces contribute to
the idea of promoting and respect-
ing craftsmanship, Fishbein said.

“There’s a deﬁnite technique
that needs to be mastered,” she ,.
said, speaking about the art me-
diums found in the SCC and the
Bridge 11 exhibit speciﬁcally.
“There’s a more homely back-
ground to it, such as the ﬁbers and
weaving. These are all mediums
that, in the history of art, have nof‘~'
been welcomed into the world of
ﬁne art. They’re considered more
part of the craft world.” I

ALBUM REVIEW

AIbum’s firstlisten white noise

Liz Keeney
Staﬁ‘ Writer
Crystal Stilts
In Love With Oblivion
“"Slumberland Records
Grade: C+

Sounds L_ike:‘The Raveonettes, Thejesus
and Mary Chain . ,

On paper, Crystal Stilts’ newest album, In
Love With Oblivion, seems like it would be
an interesting aural experience for listen-
ers. Harkening back to the gloomy sounds
of mid—to—late-’80s noise—pop bands like The
Jesus and Mary Chain but with a more mod-
ern, technically advanced twist, Crystal Stilts
should give listeners an intriguing variation
“on the noise—pop and shoegaze genres.

But In Love With Oblivion falls shortof the “ ’

promise. The problem is that, upon ﬁrst lis-
ten, Crystal Stilts is nothing but white noise.
The album has enough going on musically to
pique interest, but not to sustain it. It’s true
that, after several listens, the album begins
to grow on you. But in this day and age, that
often isn’t enough to entice listeners to buy
it. ‘ ‘ ,

Songs like “Shake the Shackles’? and
“Through the Floor” break out from the gen-

 

eral noise malaise with good, poppy beats that
draw the listener in. But when lead singer
Brad Hargett’s voice breaks in, the contrast
between the catchy rhythm and his monoto-
- nous style of singing causes a break in the
ﬂow. The band struggles to marry the two as
previous noise—pop incarnations have done
' better. Though the songs can be enjoyed in-
dividually, as a whole, the album is headache
inducing.
For_ current fans of noise-pop and shoe-
gaze, In Love Wit_h Oblivion is deﬁnitely worth
a listen. But for those who have never been a
fan of the genre, it’s not likely that this Crystal
Stilts’ production will turn anyoneinto an
enthusiast. I I

tightly knit, but originally-had no formal

' organization outside of the churches, Le-

soon said. As the University began adding
nationality rooms, the community saw an
opportunity to celebrate and share its cul-
ture. ‘ ~

The Syrian—Lebanese room itself did a
lot of traveling before arriving at Pitt. It was
originally built for a wealthy merchant in
Damascus in 1782 before being taken apart

- and’ reassembled by an art dealer in New

York. Then, a Pitt professor, Nicholas Bi-
tar, visited the well-preserved room with
the dealer. _ V

Bruhns was eager to point out thatthe
professor was, able to bargain the price down
to a mere $8,500 from the original asking

I   -«price.~'After.ithat,I.the roomwas broken.do.wn_'g

and put back together in the Cathedral.

. “After my father [Edward Lasoon, Sr.]
heard -that the room had been found, he
became overwhelminglyinvolved in the
project,” Lesoon said.

I But while Pitt acquired the intricate pan-

__;,eling and woodwork for a deal, it was so
rare and fragile that the room needed to be

locked to prevent theft and damage, and
Pitt unlocked it only for tours and special

events.

Disappointed that the culture was locked
awayfrom public view, Lesoon helped fund-
raise for the purchase of the glass door that
now guards the fragile artifacts within. The

‘ Lesoon family business, Asia Carpet and

Decorating, donated the original carpet-
ing for the room and replaced it again a
decade ago.

The other hosting room, the Greek room
was built with the cooperation of the Greek
government between 1938. and 1940. The
designer, John Travlos, ordered for the room
pure white marble from Mount Penteli in

- Northern Athens — the same type of marble

used tobuild the Parthenon.The marble
was cut by the,§ame company that provided

' .marb1e_fo.r.thétemnstruction,of the Acropo-

lis, Hareras said.

. The cut marble wasquickly loadedonto’
a ship and sent to America. One week later,
Italy invaded Greece and closed the Mediter-
ranean to American shipping. Travlos would
never oversee the construction of the room
due tothe war. But listening to a BBC broad-
cast one night on his illicit shortwave radio,
Travlos was able to listen to the dedication
of his room, Bruhns said. I

Graham at Heinz Field Saturday af-
ternoon. , V

l The team concluded its spring
practice season with its annual
Blue—Gold event, a scrimmage that
divides Pitt’s players into groups and
has them play each other.

In some ways, the game, which
includes players from last season’s
team but no incoming recruits, serves
as a predictor of the upcoming sea-
son. The 2011 season will be deﬁni-
tive for Graham, who came to Pitt
after a series of coaching switches
caused the school to lose some of its
top recruits. .

Saturday’s game provided fans
with their ﬁrst- glimpse of Graham’s
spread offense, which runs at a fast
pace and doesn’t use a huddle. '

The match—up didn’t follow the

I normal game format. Referees didn’t

keep time during the match—up, but a
Blue team consisting of mostly start-
ers playedaGold team for about 100
total plays. The Blue team won 48-
13.
For Graham, the game signaled a
successful end to the spring practice
season.
“The score was pretty predict-
able,” Graham said. “I amvery pleased

' with where we are as a team.”

Rainy weather kept crowds away,
butthe Panthers rantheir new, “high-
octane” offense just as they would
have if it had been sunny and dry.

The exciting high—octane system
was in full effect Saturday as Sunseri
launched 40-plus yard passes to his
receivers and receiver Cam Saddler
also scored ona 5-yardreverse.

“Our «ultimate goal is to take‘

care of the ball and execute on of-
fense. Iwas impressed with how the
guys played today,” Graham said. “I

thought‘ everyone did .a great job. It.

was the ﬁrst time that we have gotten

to that play count, as we ran over 100
plays on offense.”

Thegame got off to a quick start
as senior Buddyjackson returned the
opening kickoff 87 yards foran early
7-0 lead for the Blue.

A quick three-and-out series for

the Blue defense got that team the ’

ball back for a methodical drive led
by quarterback Tino Sunseri. ’
Sunseri completed all six passes
he attempted onthe ﬁrst drive for 69
yards capped with a 14-yard touch-

down pass to Devin Street. The touch- .

down gave the Blue a 14-0 lead.
Despite being seen as the front-

runnerforthequarterbackposition, V
‘Sunseri is working hard to become a

what Graham calls “a disciple of the
coaches on the ﬁeld.”

“Whenever I hear him say that,
I take that as I need to he basically
a coach on the ﬁeld,” Sunseri said.
“I need to understand the situation,
what can hurt us, what can help us. I

v need to understandthe total outlook

of the game ——where he’s thinking

Steve Garﬁnkel I Senior Staff Photographer

the ball needs to go, I need to make
sure the ball actually goes. I want to
make sure I know exactly where he
thinks the ball should go because he’s
usually right.”

Sunseri-ﬁnished the day 35-of-55
for 416 yards, with two touchdowns
and one interception.

“We expectto go down and score.
That’s the way our mentality is,” Sun-
seri said. “As an offense, we feel we
should change  ﬁeld position dra-
matically or‘ score points. We’re just
going to keep pushing forward and
keep executing our offense.”

, Despite the great stat line for the
junior quarterback, Graham knows
there is a lot of work that he can do
before training camp starts in the
summer.

‘ “When the quarterback goes out
on that ﬁeld, he needs to be an exten-
sion of [oﬁensive coordinator] Coach
[Calvin] Magee, [wide receiver coach
Mike] Norvell and myse ,” Graham
said. “That means he has to know the
offense as well as we do and believe

V-weekly practices culminated in Saturday’s annual Spring Game at Heinz Field.

in this system as much as we do. That
position’s development is the number
one key to our success.”

Anthony Gonzalez, a redshirta
- freshman, started at quarterback’

for the Gold team. Before the game,
Gonzalez was named an Ed Conway
Award winner forbeing the most im-
proved offensive player during spring
practice.

“Anthony just keeps getting bet?"

ter,” Graham said. “He just does ev-
erything right. As he develops physi-
cally and gets stronger, Ithink the he’s
going to be a special player.

‘decides   to transfer

 

_ Ryan Samson I Senior Staff Photographer
Former Pitt center].J. Richardson leaves the Panthers after two seasons.

Alexloltmanns ~

Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team
_ lost a key reserve player from
l”this season when head coach
Jamie Dixon announced over
the weekend that forward ].j.
Richardson has decided to
transfer.
The 6-foot-7, 235—pound for-
.» ward averaged 1.1 points and
0.9 rebounds per game this sea-
son as a backup to centers Gary
McGhee and Dante Taylor.
Richardson, a sophomore
from Missouri City, Texas, has
 been given a full release from
4' his scholarship by the school.
“We will assist ].]. in find-
ing the best situation for him to
reach his goals both academi-

cally and athletically,” Dixon
said. “He’s a great kid, hard

worker and good player. We ’

thank J.J. for his contribution
to our program over the last
two years and wish him much
success in the future.”

No word has been given on
exactly where Richardson will
transfer to, but he said he wants
to play somewhere closer to
home. *

“I am looking for an oppor-
tunity to move closer to my fam-
ily,” Richardson said. “I want to
thank everyone at Pitt, includ-
ing my coaches, teammates,
fans and those associated with
the program. It was a great two
years and I wish everyone well.
I’m very thankful for everything
that Pitt has done for me.” Q]

mobility. .

Gonzalez was also limited by the
red jerseyboth quarterbacks wore to
remind defensive players not to hit
them in hopes of preventing injuries.
The referees brought in to ofﬁciate
the game whistled many plays dead
in which they usually would have

the contact.

Quarterback Mark Myers, also a
redshirt freshman, did not play on
Saturday due to a thumb injury. I-Iis
absence forced Gonzalez to take all
the reps for the Gold team. _

- Wide receiver Mikeshanahan had

a big day as Su_nseri’s top target and - -
showed that he can be the premier '.

receiver for the Panthers in the fall.
“You have to have the attitude that

"if we start at the 10-yard line We’re

goingto drive the ball 90 yards. We’re
not going to huddle. We’re not going

to stop the whole way; You have to

be ready for every play,”-Shanahan I

said. “Inthis offense, anybody can get
the ball at any time. You have to run
every route like you’re the primary
receiver.”

Shanahan caught seven passes to
lead all Pitt receivers in that category,

A with 158 yards and a touchdown.
been able to gain a few yards after .

“Mike Shanahan sticks’ out to
me as a leader and as a play-maker,”

Graham said. “He will be a special ‘

player for us as he gets in mental and
physical shape.”

Kevin Harper, performing the
kicking duties forboth squads, drilled

a 52-.lyVa__rder through a break in the "

rain to bring the score to 24-7.
‘ On the next drive, junior running

‘back Desmond Brown punched in a

1-yard touchdown for the Blue to raise
the score to 31-7. » 7‘ _ A 5

Harper added three more poin
for Blue from 41 yards to increase the
score to 34-7. ' '

One of the defensive highlights of
the day came when the ball slipped
out of Sunseri’s hand and directly into

the hands of the rushing linebacker

Emanuel Rackard, who returned it
for a 10-yard touchdown. '
Despite that ﬂub, Sunseribelieves

, that the team has made a lot of im-

proyement since the ﬁrst practice

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

Pitt honored its premier student
athletes for their outstanding
achievements on and off the ﬁeld

, at its annual senior awards banquet

last week‘. '

The'school gave the prestigious
David Sandberg Champion award
to a Pitt quarterback who just might
be the most successful signal- caller
to play for the Panthers during my
four years as a student here.

No, I’m not talking about Tino

Sunseri or even Bill Stull. I’m talk- -

ing about Pat Bostick.

The award, named after a‘

former‘ Pitt wrestler and assis-
tant coach is given to the senior
that best exempliﬁes the traits
Sandberg did at the University:
dedication to academic and ath-
letic excellence accompanied by
an unyielding spirit and passionate
commitment to the improvement
of the University and its surround-
ing communities. _

And there couldn’t be a more
deserving selection for the award
in any aspect.

While mostly a career backup
to Stull and Sunseri, Bostick led

the Panthers to two of their most '

historic and memorable wins in

the program’s historywhen he was .

thrust into the starting lineup after
the starters were injured.

Who can forget the epic 13-9
upset of No. 2 ‘West Virginia in
2007 when the Panthers were just
4-7 coming into the game? In the
contest, the Mountaineers simply

needed a win to advance to the*Na- ‘

tional Championship game.
Though Bostick was just 10
for 19 for 67 yards in the game, it
was his leadership and poise that
carried the Panthers to a win that
helped turn the programaround
and lead to the signing of several

ﬁve—star recruits soon after the A

game. Those includedjon Baldwin,
Lucas Nix and Shayne Hale.
Just one year later, Bostick was

once again thrust into a big game ‘

against the Fighting Irish at Notre

‘ Dame Stadium that saw Pitt come

away with a historic 36-33 win in
four overtimes. That win made the
Panthers b'owl- eligible for the ﬁrst

- time since 2004.

Once again, Bostick’s stat line

—wasn’t anything special  a pe-

destrian 14 for 27 outing with 164
yards, one touchdown and three
interceptions.

But it~was never Bostick’s stats
that madehim successful. It was
his role as a leader on and off the
ﬁeld that should make him stand
out in people’s‘memories.

Acting almost as a coach on the
ﬁeld, Bostick was known to get to
practice early — sometimes even
before the coaches — to watch
game ﬁlm and act as_ a mentor to
younger quarterbacks like Sun-
seri. . ‘ 4 _

Many quarterbacks would be
bitter when a younger player like
Sunseri passed them on thedepth
chart, but that’s not Bostick’s men-
tality. l A
He would even goto the team’s
South Side practice facility on off
days to sit with the ‘coaches and
break down ﬁlm even further. ‘

Though the Manheim Town-
ship, Pa_., native has decided to
forgo his last year of eligibility to
pursue graduate studies, he has
taken his leadership skills to the
sidelines and the press box as an

Quarterback sets good example for local youth

ambassador to the University, working as‘
an intern with the media relations depart-

One of the most approachable people on
campus, Bostick can always be found with
a smile on his face, ready to engage in con-
versation. A

As the Pitt football program saw a decline
in reputation across the country this year
because of numerous ofllthe-ﬁeld incidents,
the work of players like Bostick often goes ,
unnoticed. . ‘ ,

Bostick called his set‘-vice—oriented in-
volvement at Oakland’s Dan Marino Field,
his work with Pitt chaplain Robert Brooks
and his community engagement in the North
Side some of his most memorable charitable
work. with the youth of the community;

“I’ve had an unbelievable opportunity at
Pitt to affect a lot of kids,” Bostick said. “It’s
big for me to show kids that have dreams how
they can achieve those'dreams.’’ ‘

So while his career nine touchdowns and
18 interceptio.ns might not be very impressive
to the naked eye, Bostick put his stamp on the
Pitt football program with historic victories
that will never be forgotten and an attitude
that leaves many of those around him with
nothing but good things to say.

Iam one of those people]
