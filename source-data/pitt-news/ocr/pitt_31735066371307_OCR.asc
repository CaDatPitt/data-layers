Hospital creates  

nuclear freeze

new laser center

By Michael Fay
‘he Pitt News

“Freeze for the Freeze” was the
motto of nearly l50 Pittsburghers
who braved the cold to tread
through a muddy Schenley Park
yesterday in a show oflocal support
for the nuclear freeze movement.

“We are very happy with the turn-
out,“ said Kathy Gughrie of the
Greater Pittsburgh Campaign for a
Nuclear Weapons Freeze, which
sponsored the walk to help fund
educational, outreach and lobbying
efforts on the local, state and
national levels.

Participants were encouraged
beforehand to find people willing to
sponsor them for at least two dollars
per mile for the five-mile walk.
Although an exact figure was not
available, walk coordinator Cortez
Johnson estimated that each walker
brought in about $50.

The walk was first discussed last
October following the defeat of a
bilateral freeze resolution in the
Senate, Guthrie said. “We wanted to
make people aware that the freeze
[movement] is still here.”

Serious preparations for the walk,
however, did not begin until Janu-
ary. “Considering the timetable and
the lack of publicity. l think we got a
good cross-section of people,“Guth-
rie said.

More of this kind of grassroots
organizing is what the freeze move-
ment needs to gain momentum in
Pittsburgh, according to Joe Guth-
rie. a chemist for the Alcoa Corpora-
tion and freeze supporter. “I think a
lot of us were encouraged by the
New Hampshire primary," he said,

Helping needy residents

South Oakland gets new community

By Cheryl Sirko
The Pitt News

The South Oakland Activity Cen-
ter. located at 422 Semple Street,
will soon open its doors to many
people of the Oakland area. thanks
to a $70,000 grant from the City of
Pittsburgh.

The center will provide recreation
and meals to area residents as a pub-
lic service that many feel was a
necessary addition to the local com-
munity. _ '

Sandy Phillips, executive director

‘of the community group People‘s

Oakland, said the activity center is
ideal for low-income families, the

Fraternal order

._ By Jon Williams

The Pitt News

Eye and Ear Hospital introduced
a new laser center on Saturday,
which will place the hospital among
the leading hospitals in the world.

The center, equipped with five las-
ers and funded in part by the Penn-
sylvania Lions of the Lions Clubs
lnternauonal, will make EEH “a
leading center in the world,“ said
Joseph L. Wroblewski, second vice-
president of the international Asso-
ciation of Lions Clubs at a
dedication ceremony.

The Lions have already given
$250,000 with an additional $30,000
to be contributed at the state con-
vention later this year, according to
Michael A. Carcaise, co-chairman
of the PL Laser Center Fund. Car-
caise added that $20,000 is expected
from the club association.

State House Representative Ray-
mond Book of Pittsburgh's 4l st Dis-
trict said the State Assembly is
looking at the project and would
work with the center to determine
finarreing from the state.

“Lasers are the wave of the
future," Wroblewski said. “They
reduce the risk of bleeding and dam-
age to the eye during operations,
allowing in-patient and out—patient
administration as quickly as
possible."

The hospital has contributed a
substantial sum to put the opthal-
mology team in place and renovate
the hospital area that now houses
the laser center facility.

Eye surgeons at EEH see the new
lasers as the most valuable weapon
in their fight against blindness.

‘These people are often very vulnerable to V
hunger and aren't sure how to prepare the

most nutritious meals.

said. “and rarely find the need to
turn someone away." ‘
Since the start of the program in
January. the center has provided a
five-meal-per—week plan to an esti-
mated 75 people, with enrollment
constantly increasing. Isaac said
that detailed investigation of meal
recipients is not necessary since most
of them already have some type of

identification indicating that they
are eligible to receive aid.

Barbara Murdock of the Hunger
Action Coalition also sees the center
as a vital addition to the community.
She noted that the center offers an
opportunity for mentally rehabili-
tated people to enjoy the many activ-
ities that take place at the center.

“These people are often very
vulnerable to hunger and aren't sure

The hospital now has an argon
laser to treat glaucoma; a yttrium,
aluminum and garnet laser to assist
in cataract surgery; a carbon dioxide
laser to vaporize tumors along the
optic nerves and the base of the
brain; a dual argon/ krypton laser to
help treat various eye diseases and
an intra-operative argon laser that is
designed specifically for use during
eye surgery and treatment of skin
lesions.

Dr. Margaret Sharrer, a member
of the EEH Opthalmology team,
said the lasers will improve patient
care. i

“Before the lasers, everyone com-
ing in for cataract surgery stayed a
few days [in the hospital], now they
stay in the hospital for a day, get
zapped with a laser and they're
gone.“

Lester Kieft, chairman of the
Pennsylvania Lions Sight Conserva-
tion and Eye Research Foundation
lnc., said a “tremendous increase in
knowledge [in the field of opthal-
mology] will be due to the number of
lasers we have; the more lasers we
have, the more uses we will find for
them.”

Samuel H. Oesterling Sr., State
Council chairman of the club, said
39,000 Pennsylvania Lions are com-
mitted to seeing the project through.
Oesterling also said the club was
placing a request with the interna-

tional association for more money j

to aid the center.

The Lions Club has a long-
standing commitment to projects-
that aid the blind. The origin ofthese
projects goes back to the time Helen
Keller approached the Lions Clubs
to fund programs, calling on them to
be the “Knights of the Blind."

center

how to prepare the most nutritious
meals," Murdock said.

Dr Lloyd Bell of Pitt's Urban/

Community Services said the recrea- ,

tional center would also benefit the
many teenagers ofthe Oakland com-
i‘i".'.1mt .

"Sir)ice kids always need a place to
do things together, the center would
be an ideal place for them to dojust
that,“ Bell said. Bell also said he does
not foresee any type of community
opposition to the use of the facility
by teenagers.

Phillips said that she cannot think
of a better use of the money. “Its a
well-located project with a very posi-
tive impact and will hopefully be
used to its fullest potential," Phillips
said.

John H. Funari, former dean of GSPIA, says it
isn't easy to break away after 14 years at Pitt. He

Studying cancer cells

Biologist looks for answers

By Tim Hunter
The Pitt News

Pitt professor David W. Barnes is
trying to answer some “sticky"ques-
tions with the help ofa $63,000 grant
he recently received from the Amen-
can Cancer Society (ACS).

“What is it that tells malignant
cancer cells migrating throughout
the body to stick in specified
organs?" Barnes asked.

A serious problem with cancer
cells, he explained, is that they
transfer from an original site of dis-
ease to another part of the body and
develop into a similar lesion in the
new location.

Barnes and his staff from Pitt's
biology department are researching
a protein called Serum.Spreading
Factor (SSF). They believe that this
protein, isolated from human blood
serum, may be the factor that tells
the migrating cancer cells to which
part of the body they should stick.

The three—year grant awarded to
Barnes is the American Cancer
Society's Junior Faculty Research
Award. According to Gail Synder
from the ACS, the award is intended
to support the research ofpromising
young investigators, freeing them
from other academic duties.

“The grant was reviewed and
approved by the research and clini-

Pitt gives  
poetry prize

The writing program of Pitt's
English department is sponsoring
the annual Academy of American
Poets Prize for the best poem writ-
ten by an undergraduate or graduate
student at the University of
Pittsburgh.

First prize is $l00 in cash. This
year. a second prize will also be
offered. a $50 gift certificate for
books of contemporary poetry.

All students currently enrolled at
Pitt are eligible. An entry should
consist of no more than three poems
typed single- or double-spaced. The
students name. address and tele-
phone number should be typed on
each page. Poems can not be
returned. so authors should keep
copies.

The deadline for the contest is
March 9. Entries may be dropped
off at the English department office.
526 CL, or mailed to Academy of
American Poets Prize, Department
of English, University of Pittsburgh,
Pittsburgh, PA l5260.

Winners will be announced
March l7 at the poetry reading by
Maxine Kumin during the Pitt Wri-
ters‘ Conference. The judges will
also be announced at that time --
7:30 p.m., William Pitt Union.

Locally. the prize is funded by the
Academy of American Poets, the
Pittsburgh Foundation and the
Spring Church Book Company.

Groups
walk for
nuke freeze

continued from page one
adding that the freeze is going to be
an important issue in this years
presidential campaign.

Schoolteacher Lyn Mead said
that she felt the walk is important
because “giving money is one thing,
but I want to feel like I‘m really
doing something. physically, to end
the threat of a nuclear holocaust.
Because I work with kids, I feel an
obligation to assure them ofa secure
future."

Individuals from a variety of
churches and organizations other
than the Campaign for a Nuclear
Weapons Freeze were represented at
the walk, including Physicians for
Social Responsibility. the Sierra
Club and the Union of Concerned
Scientists.

Wendy lsaacmang The Pitt News
Dr. David W. Barnes
cal investigation committee of the
ACS National Board of Directors,“
Synder said. “This is the tenth grant
awarded to the Pittsburgh area.“
The ACS is now providing a total of
$823,l30 to Pittsburgh area
researchers. These funds are divided
between the University of Pitts-
burgh, Carnegie—Mellon University
and Montefiore Hospital, with Pitt's
receiving the largest amount.

Barnes is studying SSF using a
model cell culture system. In this
way, all parts of the cell culture
medium can be controlled in
experiments.

“Right now, we are just working
with it [SSF] in the cell culture. We
have a long way to go before we can

apply it to humans,“ Barnes said.

Some evidence that may support

Barnes‘ hypotheses is a similar type

of spreading factor that has been iso-
lated in platelets, which are involved
in the blood clotting process. “This

vis interesting because SS F may also
be involved with this clotting pro-
cess." Barnes said.

Barnes has been working on this
project for the past five years under
previous grants from the ACS and
the National Institute of Health
(NIH).

Another professor from Pitt's
biology department working under
grants from The ACS and NIH is
Dr. James M. Pipas.

“We mostly work with oncogenes;
these are segments of DNA that
cause cancer when they are intro-
duced into the cell,” Pipas said. “We
hope to understand the mechanisms
through which they act. how many
there are within an average orga-
nism and what cells they act upon.“

On March 22, Pitt is sponsoring a
mini-symposium. Three of the
world's leading scientists, Dr. J.
Michael Bishop, University of Cali-
fornia at San Francisco; Dr. Robert
A. Weinberg, Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and Dr. George
Khoury of the National Institute of
Health, will be discussing the area of
cancer research in which Pipas is
working.

Forcing Reagan_’s
Hand

It has been nearly four years since the U.S. has dealt with
Iran, but in light of the growing war between Iran and Iraq, the
United States is going to have to get involved in some way.

_ The war between Iraq and Iran has been going on for nearly
three and a half years. The war is highly ideologically moti-
vated, and the people of Iran see the war as much a test of faith
as of political systems.

Since President Reagan has come to power on the heels of
the Iranian hostage crisis, he and the rest of America have
virtually ignored dealing with the country. The Ayatollah Kho-
meini has been an enigma to world leaders from the moment he
came out of exile in France.

' Iraq has tried to get the U.S. and Arab nations to put
pressure on Iran and have threatened to close Iranian oil
centers in the Persian Gulf. lfthis were to happen, Iran has said
it would close the critically important Straits of Hormuz.

The U.S. receives nearly 20 percent of its oil from Arab
nations, much of which must travel through that 48-mile pass.
The U.S., therefore, does have an economic stake in this war.
The war points out the failure of Reagan’s short-sighted foreign
policy. Under his administration, neither country is an ally of
the U.S.

In Reagan’s worldview, Iraq is a bad ally because of it has
ties with the Soviet Union and frowns upon our support for
Israel. Iran is a bad ally because we haven’t forgiven it for the
hostage crisis, and its government is too extreme to be stable,
according to Reagan’s model of stability.

The president must realize that a new definition of our
interests in this area is needed. We can no longer use such
narrow rules for judging countries as whether or not they are
socialist or have ties with the Soviet Union. The Iran-Iraq war
exposes the shortcomings of Reagan's foreign policy and
points out his personal inexperience in world affairs.

Time To Act

If you haven’t registered to vote in the upcoming Pennsylva-
nia primary yet. don't count yourself out. The deadline has
been extended to March I2. a week from today.

Any citizen I8 years of age or older who has lived in his
election, district at least 30 days before the April I0 primary
may vote in Pennsylvania. That category includes virtually all
students. faculty and staff at Pitt.

If you want to vote for a candidate in a primary. you must be

registered in that candidate's party. It's easy to change your
political party affiliation or your address. Simply fill out a
registration form and check “change of address." “change of
party“ or “new registration."‘whichever applies. Then. just
drop the sealed form in a mailbox — postage will be paid by the
state. —
Registration tables will be set up this week in the Towers
Lobby, the William Pitt Union, The Cathedral of Learning and
Lothrop Hall courtesy of the Governmental Relations Com-
mittee of student government.

The 6th District of Pittsburgh’s 4th Ward includes all the
dorms on campus except Forbes Hall. An estimated 3,000
dormitory students live in the district. Many ofthem are proba-
bly unaware that they qualify as voters in the district.

College students need to become more. not less. conscious of
the importance of voting than do other constituencies. Most
candidates devote a great deal of time. money and energy
appealing to various groups of voters — but rarely to students.
whose presence at the polls is consistently disappointing.

The electoral process suffers when almost half of all eligible
voters stay away, as was the casein the presidential election of
I980.

If you’ve been thinking of registering but putting it off, the
next seven days represent a perfect opportunity to begin mak-

Greek editorial
without merit

Why is it every time Greeks make
national or local news. some callow
milquetoast (Feb. 29) with a type-
writer editorializes in The Pitt
News‘? The incident at Amherst Col-
lege is an exception in every way and
should not be compared with any
other college or university. It was an
event which included factors beyond
the control of all involved. but this is
not the whole point of this rebuttal.

What is meant by. “This univer-
sity would not be remiss if it. too.
eliminated these elitist institutios?"

How are they elitist‘? It is said that
one does not have to be Greek to be a
leader. but one who is a leader can be
Greek. In addition. what is meant by
“an incestuous relationship“? All I
can gather from this statement is
that the author saw the words
brother and sister together. so he
conjured up a malignant image. The
phrase has nothing to do with the
rest of the sentence which is about
discrimination and sexism.

I had not noticed that fraternities
developed along racial lines. In fact.
I observed otherwise. My fraternity
has neither racial boundaries nor
religious boundaries which is evi-
dent from our membership. I

What is the sexism being de-
scribed‘? Let me ask this question: Is
it healthy for men and women (in
college) to always be together‘? Let’s
face it. there are some things better
kept among men or womengnot
both. Besides. there are coed honor
societies in the Greek system. in
addition to fraternities and sorori-
ties. Also. if the Little Sisters felt
they were being denigrated. they
would not be Little Sisters.

Hazing i-s not a part of the Greek
system. An entity which occurred in
the late '60s and early '70s may be
what the author is alluding to. but
nothing happens as such today.
There was an article last term by
Todd Erkel which brought many
responses showing this fact. Also.
some national fraternities. upon
acknowledging such malignment.
either revoke the chapter charter or
punish the chapter under which such
actions took place.

In government. there have been at
least sixteen members of Congress.
five governors. threejudges and one
president who were Greeks. In a spe-
cial category. there is George Gal-

The editorial "Go Greek“ that
appeared in The Pitt News was not
based on a reasoned evaluation of
the costs and benefits of the Greek
system at Pitt. Rather. it was based
on reasoning by analogy. Amherst
College eliminated its Greek system,
for whatever reason. and this is
automatically accepted as good.
Since it is good. Pitt should follow
suit.

The anonymous author(s) of the
editorial. rather than basing his case
on some sort of failing of the Greek
system at Pitt. resorted to a deluge of
unfounded charges, based, appar-
ently. on his casual and prejudicious
acquaintance with the Greek system
at Pitt.

It is a sad day for journalism at
Pitt when a newspaper. whose
reputed purpose is to inform the stu-
dent population. resorts instead to a
simple—mindcd and feeble assault on
one of its more distinguished
institutions. I

In light of The Pitt News editorial.

it appears that the newspaper has
rejected the basic tenets ofjournal-
ism in favor ofa more primitive. and
somewhat yellow. journalistic
response to an issue.

Editorial claims
rebuked

Perhaps if I explained the miscon-
ceptions about the Greek system
that apeared in the editorial “Go
Greek." Feb. 29. you would under-
stand why The Pitt News editorial
was without merit.

I. FRATERNITIES AND SOR-
ORITIES ARE ELITIST INSTI-

True. fraternities and sororities
wish to have members who will con-
tribute to the development of their
respective organizations and
members who will work well
together with the existing brother-
hood or sisterhood. What organiza-
tion does not want its prospective
members to have these qualifica-
tions‘? What company would hire an
employee who wouldn‘t work con-
structively in its existing organiza-
tion‘? If those qualifications for
membership constitute the elitism to
which the editorial refers. then I am

proud to say that fraternities and I3’

sororities are elitist institutions.

2. FRATERNITIES ANI) SOR-
ORITIES ARE SEXIST.

True. fraternities only accept male
members and sororities only accept
female members. Sororities provide
an excellent opportunity for women
to learn what they can do. All too
often. in organizations that contain
both men and women. women are
denied leadership positions. Being in
a sorority is just one aspect of a

member's life. so there are plenty of 4)

other opportunities for interacting
with the opposite sex. The segrega-
tion of the sexes in fraternities and
sororities does not deserve to be con-
stantly portrayed in such a negative
light.

3.PLEDGING MEANS ‘
HAZING.

In my sorority (as it is in most
sororities). pledging is a time for fun
-- a time to get acquainted with the
sorority organization and its
members. It is not a time for humili-
ation and fear. Hazing is strictly
prohibited by our national organiza-
tion. and we feel that it is wrong to
introduce such unnecessary
practices.

Pitt’s Eighth Annual Writers’ Conference

Lawyer-poet to be featured

Award-winning poet Law-
rence Joseph will be one of the
featured guests at the Eighth
Annual University of Pittsburgh
Writers‘ Conference. Joseph will

. read from his volume of poems,

“Shouting At No One,” which
received the [982 Agnes Lynch
Starrett Poetry Prize. The $1,000
cash prize, plus publication by
the University of Pittsburgh
Press, is awarded to an outstand-
ing first book of poetry each
year. Joseph’s manuscript was
chosen from over 400
submissions.

In addition to his career as a
poet, Joseph is also a practicing
lawyer in New York City.
Though the enormous amount of
work involved in his two careers
engages him in what some would
call a conflict, Joseph feels his
situation is “temperamentally

“The obligation or compul-
sion to write remains, regardless
of profession," says Joseph.

The poems in “Shouting At
No One" gravitate strongly
around Joseph’s background. As
the grandson of Lebanese and
Syrian Catholic immigrants, and
especially as a native of Detroit,
Joseph creates a powerful meta-
phor out of poverty, fear and
anonymity things that he saw
in that city’s landscapes.

“Joseph‘s poems cut to the
quick; they never dignify vio—
lence or try to explain it away,"
writes Hudson Review critic
James Finn Cotter. “They gleam
with the sharp edge of truth; they
are hard to forget."

Joseph's reading is scheduled
at noon on Sunday, March l8, at
the William Pitt Union. Tickets
are available free to Pitt ID

Funari reflects on his 14 years as GSPIA dean

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

John H. Funari knows he will be
leaving part of himself at Pitt after
parting company with the university
recently.

It isn't that easy to break away
from over I4 years of work in the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs and the politi-
cal science department. Funari
resigned as dean of GSPIA on Feb.
2|, after serving in that post for
nearly l0 years.

When Funari was appointed dean
in I974, then—Provost Rhoten Smith
anticipated a realignment in the
school that would point to a brighter
future.

“In light of Mr. Funari’s previous
record at Pitt and his impressive
accomplishments elsewhere,” Smith
said a decade ago. “we are confident
that the school will be in exceedingly
capable hands. We expect real pro-
gress in its development and its pro-
grams under his leadership."

Funari did not let Smith down. In
a study conducted last year by the
National Association of Schools in
Public Administration. GSPIA
ranked among the top I0 schools of
its kind.

With Funari at the helm. GSPIA
upgraded its concentrations in inter-

national affairs. public manage-
ment. policy analysis and. most
recently. urban development.

“I took a school that had pro-
grammatic incoherences." Funari
said. “It is a school. by its very
nature. divided into many groups of
faculty as to what they thought the
school should be....

“There was a solid foundation in
the school when I came here. What it
needed, and what the faculty did.
was to put that together in a coher-
ent way. Schools of public affairs
must emphasize the ability to man-
age. the skills to analyze and the will
to take risks to lead.'That‘s the driv-
ing force in what we’ve been
attempting to do over the last I0
years,“ Funari said.

Despite the school‘s successful
climb. Funari had anticipatedhe
would be stepping down soon. But
when an issue he “wouldn‘t duck“
surfaced, he said he didn't hesitate to
finalize his decision to resign.

At issue is a secret petition, signed
by eight unidentified GSPIA faculty
members. that asked for a Univer-
sity Senate investigation into faculty
governance and participation within
the school.

Senate president Richard C.
Tobias received the petition in late
January and informed Funari on
Feb. 9 that a senate subcommittee
would study the faculty members‘
claims. Funari responded to Tobias‘

letter four days later. questioning
subcommittee procedures and
appointees. reasons for the study
and GSPIA accountability and ask-
ing why he. Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var and Provost Roger Benjamin
were not informed earlier ofTobias’
intentions.

“The issue with the senate is very
sparkling clear,“ Funari said. “No
individual in...this university
...should be subject to innuendos
and vague. unspecific charges
brought by, in this case. eight anony-
mous faculty members. That is a
fundamental principle with me.

“It seemed to be better that this.
issue be faced squarely and not be
seen as a personal matter. Therefore,

I resigned."

Funari maintains his resignation
initially stemmed from faculty votes
to abolish the Faculty Advisory
Committee last September and cur-
riculum changes he approved in
urban development in January. The
intervention of senate officers also
led to Funari’s decision.

New ideas and challenges to long-
standing corecurriculum, Funari
said. are sometimes resisted by
faculty members who believe they
are being threatened by change. But.
he said. the changes. whether in syl-
labi or in empirical research, sought
to highlight the school‘s strengths
within the limits of its financial
resources.

Just as significant. Funari said. is
the fact that “it is not the business of
the dean and...certainly not...of the

president of the senate" to get
involved in faculty governance
procedures.

Tobias refused to comment on the
proposed senate study.

“I don‘t believe the University
Senate should be intervening or
injecting itself into the affairs of an
individual school," Funari said.

“Individual schools and depart-
ments have their own governing
structure. They should be permitted
to go on with their business without
the intervention of senate officers."

Funari said it was difficult for him
to think of anything in which the

recruitment and appointment of

He also added that internal dissent
has always been evident. but that
that is one of the signals of vitality.

“No one has been able to demon-
strate to me.“ Funari continued.“no
one has been able to tell me what was
any different about this than any
other issue in the school. lt'sjust that
eight faculty members — without
consultation with their colleagues
within the school. without inform-
ing the dean, without informing the
provost — went to the University
Senate anonymously. That is
different."

From that came Funari‘s decision
to resign and “to meet the crises of
Iife.“ He was replaced by former
associate dean Leon Haley. The cir-
cumstances, he admitted, were not
of his choosing. nor was the timing.
He said the issues were fundamental
and. “I could not. in my good con-
science...duck them."

future.

Corn belt to ‘Smoky City’

New media

By Leslie Weinstein
For The Pitt News

When a Pittsburgher thinks of
Iowa. a vision of farmers in a flat,
dull state usually comes to mind.
When an Iowan imagines Pitts-
burgh, he sees a dirty city. with steel
mills and black soot everywhere.

Wilfred Tremblay has heard both
negative attitudes, and he agrees
with neither. Tremblay. who was an
assistant professor in mass com-
munications at Buena Vista College
in Stormlake. Iowa, is now the new
assistant director of student activi-
ties in media and publications at
Pitt.

Tremblay was quick to describe
the truth about Iowa and its people.
as well as the Pittsburgh he has dis-
covered sincevhis arrival.

He is familiar with the east coast
having been raised in Fall River,
Massachusetts. Tremblay has also
hitchhiked all over North America
and has seen the uniqueness
throughout the states.

“Everyone thinks they're so differ-
ent, but they all have some sort of
commonality," he said of the criti-
cism often heard of many states.

He describes Iowa as a very cultu-
ral state that remains agriculturally

. oriented. He also emphasized the

quality of its educational system and

Tremblay.

His new job entails working with

the development of Pitt's media and
sees that no money is being wasted.
He feels that some of the problems
with the media are ones of low

thinks needs to be improved.

He has already created a group
called the “Media Coalition." con-
sisting of the Pitt media heads.
which meets weekly to discuss com-
mon problcms. He hopes this group
will help to “create a more profes-
sional attitude“ within the media
and create a more positive attitude
from the public.

Tremblay has a special love for
radio. not just because he taught
radio production at Buena Vista
College. but also because of his deep
interest in music. Asa freshman in
college. Tremblay received a scho-
larship to Bcrklee School of Music
in Boston for his superior drumming
abilities.

After I‘/3 semesters at Bcrklee. he
became restless and quit school to
begin recording with some ja/I
musicians in addition to touring the
states with some hands. He later
settled in Joncsboro, Ark.. where he
attended Arkansas State and
received a bachelors degree in radio
and television. Returning to Boston.
Tremblay got his master‘s in film
and broadcasting and then headed
back out west for his job at Buena

ilrcmblay has decided to settle
here in Pittsburgh with his wife of
three years and their baby. who is on
the way. In May. he will return to
Iowa to share in the natural child-
birth with his wife. Then the three of
them will return and start a new life
in Pittsburgh.

Tremblay’s wife was alsoa profes-
sor at Buena Vista College. teaching
interpersonal communications. She
will eventually pursue a career in
Pittsburgh. He is also thinking of
continuinghiseducation by working
on a doctorate in educational com-

While everyone of the 5,771 peo-
ple in attendance seemed painfully
aware of Vaughan's progress,
Vaughan himself denied thinking
about it.

“if I was going after the record, 1
would have shot the ball 25 or 30
times today,” Vaughan said. “I
didn‘t even know how many pointsl
had.“

Culbertson thought that Vaughan
and the rest of the Panthers had the
record on their minds in the early
part of the game.

“it was never discussed," he said,
“but you could tell that we were try-

ing to make [the ball] go in instead of ,

just shooting."

By the midway point ofthe second
half, Chipman had only one record
on his mind, and that was the Panth-
er’s final win-loss total. Chipman
became uncharacteristically ani-
mated as his team struggled back.
Off came Chipman's jacket, and the
fourth-year coach began pacing the
sidelines in a way reminiscent of
Tiger Paul Auslander.

“I saw Louie Carneseca do this all
the time, and he wins a lot ofgames,”
Chipman said. “I have to admit, it
got a little nervous out there.”

Now, Chipman and the Panthers
pack and ready themselves for their
second appearance in the Big East
Tournament. They have already
escaped the biggest obstacle -—
another game with league-leading
Georgetown ~A by finishing in sixth
place.

“lf we are going to play them
[Georgetown] again, 1 want to play
them Saturday night at 7 o'clock,"
Chipman said.

Should the Panthers make it that
far. Chipman would do well to
remember the Carneseca routine.
Remember it was Louie and his
Redmen who won last year's Big
East post-season tournament.

LANDOVER, Md. A first-
half offensive explosion by fourth-
ranked Georgetown paved the way
for its 88-71 dismantling of lath-
ranked Syracuse on Saturday.

The Hoyas‘ near-flawless perfor-
mance before a sold-out Capital
Centre audience not only clinched
Georgetown’s first outright Big East
regular season championship, but it
also served as fair warning to the
league's remaining eight teams that
nothing short of a spectacular upset
will stop the ‘Hoyas at this week‘s Big
East conference tournament.

“When they [Georgetown] play
the way they did in the first half,
there is no one in our league close to
them," admitted Syracuse coach Jim
Boeheim. Although his Orangemen
had the chance to gain a share ofthe
regular season title with a victory,

‘ I AI

I984

Georgetown executed with precision
from the outset and was never
seriously challenged.

Led by 6-1 I junior forward Ralph
Dalton and All-America center Pat
Ewing, Georgetown shot a sizzling
69 percent from the field in building
an insurmountable 48-27 lead at
intermission. Dalton and Ewing
combined to make six of seven field
goal attempts, contributing I8
points and 12 rebounds to help
decide the issue by halftime.

The strong play of Dalton and
Ewing further contributed to Syra-
cuse's downfall by forcing the entire
Orange front line into foul difficulty.
Beefy center Andre Hawkins
asserted himself in the forecourt,
where Syracuse collected I9 oftheir
27 first-half points, but picked up his
third personal with 5:07 left in the
half. All four front court regulars
(Hawkins, Sean Kerins, Rafael
Addison and Wendell Alexis) even-
tually fouled out.

 Georgetown crushes Orange,
88-71,for regular season title

ever, Syracuse‘s inability to score
from the perimeter kept the Orange-
men from posing a threat.

“You have to shoot the ball well
against Georgetown to have any
kind of a chalice,” Boeheim
reasoned.

Sophomore Rafael Addison, who
has taken game scoring honors for
the Orangemen 13 times this season,
failed to connect on all seven of his
first-half attempts, while as a team,
Syracuse shot less than 35 percent in
the first half. More importantly, the
()rangemen‘s poor shooting allowed
the Hoyas to crank up their brilliant
running game.

Georgetown’s impressive fast
break spread production through-
out the lineup, sending seven players
into double figures in scoring. Ewing
collected game high honors with 16,
while David Wingate and reserve
Michael Graham contributed ll
points each.

With point guard Michael Jack-
son in the driver's seat. the Hoyas
ran with the efficiency of a
chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce. Jack-
son set up three second-half dunks.
including an awesome alley-oop to
Ewing that electrified the Senior
Day crowd of l9,035.

Fourteen second-half points by
Orangeman Dwayne ‘Pearl’
Washington, which gave hima game
high 20, and the continued good
play of Andre Hawkins saved Syra-
cuse from embarrassment.

With the Big East tournament set
to begin Wednesday night at New
York City's Madison Square
Garden. Georgetown has added one
more soldier for the battle in the Big
Apple: momentum.

“It has so much to do with
momentum from here on out.“ said
Georgetown coach John Thomp-
son. And so it is that his charging
Hoyas will loom so large come Wed-
nesday and beyond.

Seton Hall stopped the Lady
Panther basketball team's quest for
a Big East championship and a
NCAA bid by upsetting the top-
seeded Lady Panthers 80-68 at St.
John's Alumni Hall on Saturday.

Pitt, which finished the season I6-
12, 6-3 in the Big East, advanced to
the semifinal meeting with Seton
Hall by squeezing past Connecticut
(9-20, I-9) on Friday, 60-57.

“Our kids had a lot of poise,” Pitt
head coach Judy Saurer, said. “They
didn’t abandon ‘the system, which
has worked all season long.”

Saurer‘s system worked efficiently
in six of eight Big East regular sea-
son meetings. However, this is the
second time the Bucettes defeated
the Lady Panthers this season.

“Seton Hall will be the most hurt
by graduation,” Saurer stated.
“They lose Foster, Fairbanks and
Bradley."

Marcia Foster fouled out at 4:07,

but Leslie Fairbanks contributed I5
points and seven rebounds. Cindy
Allman scored I5 and had seven
assists. Gloria Bradley was an
unstoppable force on the court,
leading the scoring by making five of
five fromtheline and nine of l4from
the floor. Bradley also grabbed I5
rebounds, despite playing with four
fouls for most of the second half.

“Gloria’s a dominating player,“
Seton Hall coach Sue Dille said.
“Jennifer Bruce is also just a great
player. We did try to hold her, but
we couldn't stop her from playing.“

Bruce, who went into the tourna-
ment leading the league in scoring,
was held to I4 points and four
rebounds before fouling out with
7:l4 left.

“She's not Superwoman,” Saurer
said, “but she did play hard and
tough. When I had to take her out,
she cheered the loudest from the
bench.”

Stephanie Collins once again
came off the bench to rattle off five
consecutive jumpers, but it was not
enough. Collins led the team, scor-

ing a season-high 20 points by mak-
ing I0 of IS from the field.

Julie Callan also fouled out, but
not before totaling I7 points and
four rebounds. Callan, selected to
the Big East all-freshman squad, was
7-for-I0 from the court and 3-for-4
from the foul line.

Point guard Kim Tirik's eight
assists against Seton Hall and five
against Connecticut Friday brought
her total to I86, tying the mark set

by Debbie Lewis in I982. Tirik's I2_

against Connecticut last season
established a regular-season assist
record for a single game.

Two factors in determining the
Bucettes’ win were rebounding and
fouls. Seton Hall dominted the
boards, holding a 4|-24 margin,
while Pitt committed 24 fouls com-
pared to Seton Hall’s I6.

The Lagy Panthers scored first
but constantly found themselves try-
ing to play catch-up after falling

behind by a score of 16-4 early on. I

Pitt cut the lead to four at the half,
34-30, and the lead seesawed.

long, so it was not ususual for us to
lose that [I6-4] lead,” said Dille.

On the strength of Collins’ outside
shooting, Pitt brieﬂy took the lead
midway through the second half, 48-
46, but it was Pitt’s last lead since the
Lady Panthers ran into foul trouble
late in the game.

Ellen Gilhooley, after contribut-
ing six rebounds and scoring only
three points, was the third Pitt
player to foul out.

Dille attributed her team’s victory
to its defensive tenacity. “The key
was when they came back and made
it a two-point game, but we held
them to that and won."

Callan.

“Tirik kept growing this year. Lisa

For only the second time this sea-
son, the Panther gymnasts (I3-2)
were defeated as Ohio State rolled
past Pitt, 276.85-264.00.

The Panthers knew what had to
be accomplished long before the
meet ever started if they intended to
leave the Columbus, Ohio, campus

~ with a victory. They knew that it

they were to defeat the Buckeyes,
they would have to hit every routine
and hope that OSU would miss with
some consistency.

The Panthers, for the most part,
did theirjob; however, the Buckeyes
were not so cooperative.

“I thought we looked pretty
good." Pitt coach Frank D’Amico
said. “The scores weren‘t a good
reflection of how good we were. The
scores were one- or two-tenths
below normal. The low scores were
expected because we were going up
against a powerhouse."

In the floor exercise, Panther
Mark Klafter scored a 9.4 and cap-
tured first place. Chad Lape and
Dave Moskovitz of Ohio State each
scored 9.3 to get the other top places.
Pitt‘s Dave Smith scored a 9.2.

lilllliig
PITT RING WEEK

The Panthers trailed by less than a
point after the opening event, but
the meet was blown wide open after
the pommel horse. which has
plagued Pitt all year.

Three gymnasts from Ohio State
easily swept the side horse. Steve
Bradley led the charge by scoring a
9.5. Seth Reskin and Tim Muench
each scored 9.3 to finish second and
third. Senior Frank Kratz was the
highest Panther scorer with an 8.8.

The Panthers were down by six
points after the pommel horse. Six
points is too much ground to gain on
a top-notch team.‘

The still rings was next, and OSU
increased its advantage. Buckeye
Joe Bowers scored a 9.5 to win the
competition. Klafter and Jim Froo-

man (OSU) tied for second place,

each receiving 9.25.

At the midway point of the meet,
the Buckeyes were leading by the
score of |37.65 to l3l.35.

The vaulting competition was
closer, but Ohio State still managed
another sweep. Bowers and Bradley
each earned 9.3 marks while Froo-
man scored a third-place 9.l5. For
the Panthers, Kratz and sophomore
Matt Peters tied for fourth place
with scores of 9.l.

On the parallel bars, Reskin and
Bob Playter took the top two spots
with scores of 9.45 and 9.3. respec-
tively. Peters and OSU‘s Bradley
tied for third position with 9.l
scores.

In the final event. the high bar, the _

Buckeyes turned in super routines as
they again swept the event. Playter
led the attack with a 9.75 while Brad-
ley (9.65) and Bowers (9.5) followed
for second and third. The top.
Panther score was 9.1 by both Klaf-ii
ter and Smith.

In the all-around competition, the
top two spots went to OSU‘s Steve
Bradley (55.60) and Dave Mosko-
vitz (54.85). Pitt’s Mark Klafter
managed third place (53.65).

Kfalz. who competed in the all-
around competition forthe firsttime
in weeks, did a commendable job
scoring 53.40.

“Frank looked strong and solid,”
D’Amieo said. “He looked as strong
as he has all year long. Mark [Klaf-
ter] looked good in his events. We
just didn‘t get the scores that we nor-
mally get for our routines.“

The next Panther meet is at
Slippery Rock on Saturday. Then,
Pitt finishes its season at home
against Penn State on March I7.

Ladies
win  
handily

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

The Lady Panther gymnastics
team had little problem in defeat-
ing James Madison l79.2-l54.75
on Saturday night at Trees Hall.

The meet was Pitt‘s last ofthe
I983-84 season. A brief cere-
mony was held at the meet in
honor of Pitt's graduating

‘seniors. At the ceremony, Lisa
Shirk, Karen Martin, Babbie
Flock, Sara Strickland and Eve
Singer were each presented with
a blue blanket, the traditional
gift the Lady Panther gymnastics
team presents to its seniors.

The seniors went out in style
by helping the squad attain the
second-highest score this season.
The score will help boost Pitt's
seasonal scoring average. which
is important when national rank-
ings are determined.

Pitt followed the record-
setting lead of All—America Lisa
Shirk, who rewrote the Lady
Panther record books for the
second time this season?

Earlier this season. Shirk
scored 37.45 in the all-around
event against Slipppery Rock to
set a new individual scoring
record. January's mark fell Sat-
urday night when Shirk totaled
38 points. Her winning form was
at a peak on the uneven parallel
bars and vault; Shirk scored a 9.7 1
and 9.5, respectively.

“lt‘s getting towards the end of
the season,“ Debbie Dabkowski
said. “Everybody had a hard
time getting up for this meet after
big meets like Florida and Geor-
gia. We tried to do it for the
seniors —- it was their last meet."

“We took the lead right away,"
Alisa Spector said, “and we kept
it. It was a different kind of meet.
We would have liked to break
180, but we made mistakes. We
know we can easily break it is
again, so the meet went well.”

The Lady Panthers will next"-
see action on Saturday as Pitt
travels to Maryland.

Penguins need new beginning g

lay Saul Markowitz
_For The Pitt News

 

Does Pittsburgh really have a
hockey team‘? Can one watch the
Boys of Winter grow?

For some time, I’ve been
attempting to construct answers
to these probing questions. What
has been discovered over the past
three years is a hockey club that
has gone from playoff conten-
tion to one that has such prob-
lems that they have trouble
winning 20 games in a 80-game
schedule.

‘This seaons was to be a com-
plete turnaround from the hap-
less year that they struggled
through in I982-83. With Eddie
Johnston at the reins, the Pens
accumulated their worst record
in history. Their record included
only 45 points and a place
reserved especially for them in
the cellar ofthe National Hockey
League (NHL). '

Throughout the off-season,
the organization did a slight
spring cleaning and acquired

-some new, young and semi-

talented players.

_So, the outlook supposedly
was bright for a team which was
in dire need of fan support and
respect in the leaue.

  

Well, the season is half over,
and here are the changes that we
have witnessed. The Pens, with
new coach Lou Angotti, are cur-
rently in last place in the Patrick
Division, tied with the New Jer-
sey Devils. They have a mere 34
points and have the distinction ol
being tied for the worst record in
the entire league. The attendance
at the Civic Arena has dwindled
drastically; an average of 6,866
people view the home games.
The only bright spot for the Pen-
guin fans is the ability to always
be able to buy seats for any con-
test, and watch great players
from other teams show the Pens
how to play the game.

There are many reasons, as I
see it, for the Pens‘ downfall.
When the team, in the off-
season, decided to rebuild with
so many unexperienced young
players, they knew that these
men would need much support
and, most importantly, much ice
time from the coaches and all
those involved with the club.

What occurred this season was
player change after player
change. Players were constantly
returned to the minors to Balti-
more, the Pens‘ farm club.

These players needed ice time.
With this in mind, one can easily
understand why Baltimore is
currentl in first lace in their

  Véé

division in the American Hockey
League. Just remember that a
team cannot be too organized
when over 45 player changes
occur in one season.

The Penguin defense has also
faltered this season. Including
their long-awaited win at home
Saturday, the Pens have given up
315 goals and have scored 206.
Players succh as Randy Carlisle
and Doug Shedden, who were
productive in the past, have
seemingly lost their leadership
qualities. They must rekindle

their skills once- more, or be
traded for newer qualified lead-
ers. A team without scoring
threats and one lacking defense
must find new ways ofwinning at
any cost, even if that includes
trading away veterans in the
process. ‘

The major stumbling point
which has plagued the Pens all
season has been the constant

Culbertson,
Pitt nip  
Friars,61-60

By Todd Erkel
The Pitt News

‘The record belonged to someone else, and
with it, most of the game’s emotions, but
when Billy Culbertson stepped to the foul
line with l6 seconds remaining, there were
greater concerns at hand.

With a nervous mother in attendance and
his career at the Fitzgerald Field House all
but behind him, the 6-0 senior converted the
most important foul shots of his stay at Pitt
to seal a 61-60 senior day victory.

“I didn’t have records or anything on the
line; ljust wanted to win,“ Culberston said
afterwards.

As he spoke, the Camden, N.J., native
clutched his only spoil of victory ~ the net
from the basket at the east end of the Field
House. It wasn't a record, but it meant a lot

‘to him.

Upstairs at the Field House, Mrs.
Dorothy Culbertson clutched just as tightly
to her son's senior appreciation plaque. She
preferred not to take up any of her son‘s
spotlight, other than to say she was proud.

Billy Culbertson, similarly, wanted to talk
more about his senior teammate Clyde
Vaughan than about himself. Vaughan fin-
ished the afternoon with 2l points, leaving
him three points away from becoming the
all-time leading scorer at Pitt.

“I wanted him to get the record so badly,"
Culbertson said, “but, unfortunately, we
had to win the game, so I had to take some
shots down the end."

Culbertson scored 12 very important
points in the second halfto help the Panthers
recover from a 10-point halftime deficit that
threatened any hopes of a successful post~
season for the team.

, Had the Panthers not struggled back, they
most likely would have spent the past two
days practicing for a Wednesday night game
against Seton Hall. lnstead, they had a day
off to think about their 3 pm’. Thursday
game against Villanova.

“There was no way that we wanted to be in
that game,” Culbertson said ofthe possible
meeting with Seton Hall.

The Panthers looked as if they wanted
nothing more than to face Seton Hall in the
first half, as Providencejumped out to a 70
lead. Pitt could not score its first points until
the 17-minute mark and went down by nine,
13-4, early in the period.

The Friars repeatedly tossed the ball to
their 6-9 center Otis Thorpe, who responded ‘
with l4 first~half points and eight rebounds.

Pitt came out at halftime determined to
pick up the tempo of the game and to do
whatever was needed to slow Thorpe down.
The team managed to dojust that, but in the
process, the entire Panther front line of
Andre Williams, Keith Armstrong and Chip

»Watkins fouled out of the game.

Fortunately for Pitt. Thorpe shot a medi-
ocre 7-13 from the foul line, including many
errant one-and—one attempts.

“We didn’t foul Thorpe in the first half.“
Panther head coach Roy Chipman said.
“We didn‘t tire him. ln the second half. at
least he was working for everything he got.“

Pitt made the most ofThorpe’s misses and
slowly built itself a seven-point lead on a
Vaughan layup, which made thegscore 48-4!
and left Vaughan only eight points away
from the record.
