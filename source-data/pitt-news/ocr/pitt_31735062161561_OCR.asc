Wlzerein Petitioners
For Campus Political
fobs Are Discourages:

By ROBERT AD.-‘:».l‘.ES

Ifl(lllD.l2lll'l pen fiourishers willi

be in paraclise today and M011-
day, and simply because some
students have the quaint idea
that there is some glory to be
gained from campus politics.
Students with John Hancock
complexes will have plenty of op-
portunities to sign their names to
the petitions which are being cir-
culated by some 100 would-be

nominees to Student-Faculty As- ,

sociation, Men’s Council, and Col-
lege Association.

Accompanying the search for
eligible signatures, (and any stu-
dent who can write is eligible),
is a hunt by the candidates for
pictures to paste on the petitions.

Concerning the kinds of people
whose names it is well to have on
petitions, it may be stated author-
itatively that it just doesn’t mat-
ter. We heard an inexperienced
sophomore who wants to run for
SFA asking three campus big-
shots to sign his petition. He was,
according to political wiseacres,
acting upon a thoroughly false
principle, even though most
BMOC’s are easy to approach.

Names Don’t Count

“It doesn’t matter whose name
is on your petition,” the Indepen-
dent big-shot told him. “If the
boys on the Executive Committee
know you and think that you
ought to be nominated, you’re in.
And if you’ll interfere with their
slates, you don’t stand a ghost’s
chance of getting the nomination,
even if nobody but ODK men
signed your petition.”

So if you are asked to sign pe-
titions today and Monday, don’t
be ﬂattered.

As for what the would-be can-
didate has if he does get the de-
sired nomination, it may again be
stated authoritatively that it just
doesn’t matter unless he’s in with
the right organization or his name
is Nick Spanos or Jack Hoeveler.

Offices which are open for nom-
inations are ten positions in Men’s
Council, four ofﬁcerships of the
CA Cabinet, and 30 posts in the
SFA Assembly.

As many as 40 nominees for
Men’s Council may be chosen.
Comment from another student
politician: “Men’s Council is a no-
good organization.”

Including present junior ‘mem-
bers of the SFA Assembly, who
will be automatically renomin-
ated, a total of 60 candidates for
SFA will be chosen by the Exec-
utive committee for announce-
ment at the Assembly meeting
on Tuesday, April 12. If the opin-
ions of more student politicians
may be believed, the situation is
something like this:

Preparei Program
Fraternity men who have al-
ready been picked for the regu-
lar slates will be nominated. In-
dependents who have already

been picked for the regular slates '

will be nominated. Other stu-
dents in both categories who are
probable vote-getters will not be
nominated. Political nonentities
will complete the list of 60 nomi-
nees.

Of course, none of this sup-
posed information may be found
by reading the constitution of SFA
and Men’s Council in the Pitt
Compass or Vade Mecum. But

the United States constitution
didn’t provide for the Democratic
party, either.

Oh, yes, the news in this ar-
ticle: Petitions for College As-
sociation must be returned by 5
o’clock today to the College of-
fice, 204 State Hall. Petitions for
SFA Assembly must be handed
in by 5 o’clock Monday in the of-
fice of the dean of men, 809
Cathedral, or the office of the dean
of women, 1209 Cathedral. Pe-
titions for Men’s Council are due
by 4 o’clock Wednesday in the
office of ‘the dean of men.

‘Piclcets Please’
1 Company Plays
At Syria Mosque

Presenting a “command petr-
formance” for the Syria Tem-
ple, the Cap and Grown Club
will present a. preview of their
1938 show, “Pickers, Please”
tonight at Syria Mosque.

The company will open next
Monday night at 8:15 o’clock in
the Nixon theater.

Dante Dalle-Tezze, C38, varsity
letterman, will make his last series
of public appearances for Pitt
when he steps onto the Nixon stage
in the role of Dictator Bellini.
Playing with him, as King Ru-
dolph, will be Al Barr, BA38, vet-
eran star of several C&G shows.

Love interest, for the next week,
at least, will center about Princess
Jullianne, or William Vaughen,
BA41, and Prince Rodney, or Wil-
liam Gibson, C39. But though
spring is here, all will not be well
with the lovers, for Queen Hilda,
Milton Hoffman, BA40, is attempt-
ing to rope the handsome young
Prince.

Costumes and sets for “Pickets,
Please” have come from New
York. Many of the costumes are
exact replicas of famous European
uniforms, and were supplied by
lthe Brooks Costume company.
]Sets, formerly used for “The Great
|Waltz” and “Save Me a Waltz,”
,were presented to the University
by Max Gordon.

“Pickets, Please” is a modern
interpretation of labor difficulties,
dictatorships, and loves, played in
true musical comedy style in the
kingdom of Asphyxia.

T

Students in biology classes at
the University henceforth will be
able to study marine animal life
at ﬁrst hand. The biology depart-
ment is now the possessor of two
salt-water aquaria, straight from
Woods Hole marine laboratory.
The aquaria are somewhat of a
rarity. Few inland colleges pos-
;ess them. ‘

So far, the experiment has been
singularly successful, the mortal-
ity rate being low. One clam has
died, another was sacriﬁced on
he altar of science, and a starﬁsh
ate a snail. The other deep—sea
ienizens. have been enjoying good
health, except for
smallsponge, which was includ-

d in the shipment by 1nistal«;e;_'-“

a decadent.

the specimens are a pair of queer,

ghostly creatures related to the

shrimp family. They are almost

completely’ ‘transparent, and as-

piring young biologists can see

what makes them tick without any V
trouble at all.

The exhibition has been visited
by many persons, among them a
club from Falk elementary school,
calling itself, for some reason,‘ the

viewed the aquaria with interest,
examined the stuffed specimens,
and went away content withtheir
ﬁrst, and perhaps last, experience
in deep—sea ﬁshing.

Said Dr. Witz, who is in charge
of the aquaria, “Few students are

able to study marine life at the
M _  sea-shore, so we brought the sea-
Perhaps the most interesting of l shore to the students.”

The question being argued at
the Forum today is the national
Pi Kappa Delta debate topic. It
, was used yes-
terday when
Ed Springer,
C39, and Hy-
man Richman,
C39, took the
negative side
against Uni-
versity of Ver-

veteran debat-
ers. McKen-
na has been a
member of the debate group since
his freshman year. He also be-
longs to SFA, and is business
manager of the Journeyman, pub-
lication of the Quill Club.

Dizenfeld is a transfer student
from Geneva college. Both of the
debaters belong to the Intercolle-
giate Conference on Government
delegation.

McKenna and Dizenfeld have
argued the NLRB topic several
times previously. McKenna has
taken the negative argument, op-
posing the extension of the Labor
Board’s powers. However, he says,
he has become convinced that the
Board should enforce arbitration
in industzial disputes. Dizenfeld
has been on the affirmative side
of the argument in his debates.

Students Offer To Participate
In Military Action Against Japs
‘To Stave Off Inevitable War’

By GERALD ZISKIND

By an overwhelming plurality,
University students endorse an
immediate invasion of Japanese
shores in order to “stave off the
i.nevitable war anyway,” and al-
most as emphatically subscribe to
the old age Townsend revolving
pension plan, a series of public
opinion polls conducted on a num-
'ber of vital public questions re-
vealed today.

There is an ever-pressing need
for immediate military action
against Japanese agression, stu-
dents charged. Our army is pre-
pared, they insisted, and offered
willingly to paricipate in the in-
vasion themselves.

‘FIGHT FOR PEACE!’

“I can ﬁght,” one student, a
prominent member of Peace
Council, thundered. “We must
ﬁght for peace. The h—l with all
these wishy-washy paciﬁsts.”

Another put it in this way:
“We youngsters have pent—up en--
ergies which we must get rid of.
Why not let them loose on Japan?
Thereby we can avoid future
wars.”

On the other hand, the poll in-
dicates strong sentiment among
ROTC members for isolationist
policies, for withdrawal of Amer-
ican troops and battleships from
foreign waters, and strict adher-

ence to neutrality principles.
Said one prominent undergrad-
l with Amer-

stagingof football gamaes by their l ican interests, _ The army and
clients was “the perfomance of an {navy have too long been the tools
essential governmental function.” i for fostering imperialistic inter-

l

..___

vention in other countries. True
military men abhor the growing
tendency of armaments in this
country. Why, common sense
should tell you that these policies
are drawing us closer and closer
to a war which may mean the
end of civilization.”
JAPANESE PROTEST

Before this publication’ release,
the student cry for immediate war
was reported to the State Depart-
ment, which received the infor-
mation with grave concern. De-
partment ofﬁcials are now consid-
ering the sending of prominent
government officials here to ap-
pease student rage. The Japanese
consul has already protested to
SFA officials.

Relevant to student support of
the Townsend plan, stronghope
was felt for its revival in. SFA
campaigning. Fifty nominees have
already indorsed the plan, while
others continue to hold out for a
larger pension.

“The amount of monthly pen-
sion is grossly inadequate,” one
candidate charged. “Considering
the rapid increase of commodity
prices, the pension would be un-
humane.”

Gratiﬁed by the overwhelming
student approval of his plan, Dr.
Townsend sends the following
telegram to University of Pitts-
burgh students: _

FINE WORK STOP WE OLD-

STERS MUST STICK T0-

GETHER_i_STOP HAPPY

Slide-H om Dorsey Plays, '

Autographs For-V    Blind

By AUSTIN HAY e

A mild furor occurred Tuesday
evening in the middle of the reg-
ular ‘Pitt Concert Band. practice
on the mtvventy-third floor when
top-notch" swing mae'str'o Tommy
Dorsey stepped into the room.

Currently appearing at the
Stanley theater with his orches-
tra, Mr. Dorsey paid a visit to
“hear a really good band,” be-
tween his appearances.

DESIRE TO LISTEN

He expressed a desire only to
listen, so with the usual trumpet
fanfare, Mr. Finney directed the
football favorite, “The Thunder-
er.” Dorsey focused his keen blue
eyes on individual players, a broad
smile glowing onhis face ruddy
with dabbed make-up.

He remarked, “I wasn’t able to
watch Pitt play Fordham, or those
other two ties, but I’ll make it a
point next year.” Shouts of per-
suasion ﬁnally got him on the po-
dium. He spoke of his father and
then conducted.

“In Dad’s band,” he recalled,
‘we always put an umph on the
end of the number whether an
al:'ter‘ocat was written in the score
3r not. We had fun in those days
——even used to march 16 miles in
:1 driving rain for a dollar and a
:ialf. Sousa was a friend of Dad’s.
Dad would watch Sousa like I
‘.\/El’.'Cl’l Benny Goodman.”

CLASSICS BEST

ie continued in the midst of
laughter, “It is good practice to
take up instruments different
from those employed in jazz
bands. I’m glad to see these
aboes, bassoons, baritones and
English horns. Classical
is by far the best. Anyone can
)lay jazz and jam. Be a good
-lassicist ﬁrst—-—swing will come
later.”

music I

,~ Everyone begged him tdplay,
so‘ he borrowed member‘ Dick
Haukhoton’s trombone and sat in
on .a .“session” of “Hail to Pitt,’?
which, by the way, he played-in
New York when the band paid
its respects at the Hotel Commo-
dore.

AUTOGRAPHVS

“I can see now what I missed
in college. Once I had a chance
to attend Penn State but at the
time music cametﬁrst. Now I’d
give my right arm to have a col-
lege education—-—and this left arm
of my new trombone played could
keep time.”

While autographing everything
from torn music to drum heads,
the swing leader told of his expe-
rience and plans for his band.

“Ten weeks in a year I spend
on six-day stage runs and another
ten weeks on one-night stands.
It’s great sport to play at col-
lege dances. Last year I played
at 38 jobs, mostly in the east and
south.

SOMETHING LASTING

One of my greatest aims is to
fashion my band into something
tasting‘. New fads like rippling
rythms do not last. Swing is
popular because the public is
tired of Waltzes and straight
rhythm. If I could acquire a sort
of combination of Whiteman,
.’}ood1'nan, King, and Kemp I think
.ve’d have something.

“You boys have really the best
college band I’ve ever heard; and
not only the best band but the
lluc"Sl. building.
,;:l‘OLlCl, indeed.”

“Late again.” he shrieked glanc-
ing at his watch and instantly
Band Manager Bauman, Orr and
Broudy whipped the noted
swingster downtown for his next
per:t'ormance.

Being: moinentumized on the

is the 1no’ve1i1e1.it to organize
‘oaseball into a spring sport at
‘he llnivr-rsit_v. Nothing was
«lone to the idea except give it
a mention and already there has
been an encouraging response.

Those who are wholeheartedly
interested in it are the ones who
can do the most good." Going
around and lining up supporters
is the first move.

Duquesne First

It should be realized that the
evolution of the
diamond sport
on the campus
will most likely
be a slow proc-
ess. Therefore,
e V e r y little
thing that is
done now is an
important fac-
tor.

took the ﬁrst
step among the

\

I_,Qvi5on locals last year
with a team
gszfacticing and uniformed. .The

Dukes, I believe, played a few
gaines, but realized, more than
.-anything else, that once the three
rity institutions got together, their
chances of getting some place
would be boosted considerably.

There has been a report to the’

-.effect, that despite the lack of ad-
ministrational sanctions, the boys

across the street car tracks are

going to get a team together. If
this is true and if it is carried out
with the necessar enerd Carne-

A Few Tackles

Indication from up on the prac-
tice ﬁeld where Dr. Jock Suther-
T_ind’s football squad is going
through its pre—Easter paces is
that, contrary to previous public
evidence, the gridiron team will
have a couple of huskies standing
between the guards and the ends
on the forward wall next fall.

There are four boys receiving
the attention for the tackle posts
now. Ralph Hafer, a junior from
Dormont, who seems to lean to-
ward the Ave Daniell type, and
Elmer Merkovsky, the senior big-
frioy from Scott, are ﬁrst in what-
-ever order there can be said to be.

Two sophomores are providing
the opposition. One of them is Ted
Konetsky, who comes from Ger-
man Township High where he was
tutored by Ted Dailey. He seems
to show the most promise‘.

“Spares and strikes forever” is
tire byword of the thirteen Greek
social fraternities these days as
they met at the Center-Neville

their respective leagues.

Leading the ten-pin knock—down
in League A are Kappa Sigma and

victories against two setbacks.
League B leadership is shared by
Sigma Alpha Mu, defending
champs, and Pi Kappa Alpha.

ords, Arnie Levine’s 12 is still
high for a single game. “By” Mc-
Laughlin has a total of 492 for
the highest match score. A This is
an average of 164 for a game. His

be leading except that he arrived

match arid then proceeded to

Pitt ilcemenz Play Carroll

Next Wfeek For I Trophy ..

By JIIVI

DAILEYE

Dates for the Ohio-Pennsylvania Collegiate liockey play-off

between Pitt and John Carroll
for next Monday in Pittsburgli,
Tliursday in Cleveland.

There is some controversy

have been deﬁnitely :l111l0llllC€d
and the following ’l‘1iesday and

as to the method of play-off;

whether it should be by the total-goal systein or whether the

championship
mined by the winner of the best
out of three.

Coach McSorley of the Panth-
ers is holding out for the best-
out-of-three system which he
believes to be a fairer test. Mr.
McSorley deems it unfair to have
one team run up a big ‘score in
the third game and win’ the cham-

----, pionship, "although it may have

lost the ﬁrst two games by a nar-
Iiow margin.

 Announcement of the method of '

determining the champion will be
made Monday.

ARSENAULT AGAIN

Meanwhile, John Carroll barely
defeated Western Reserve, 2-1,
last Tuesday night in Cleveland
to earn the right to meet Pitt. As
usual Carroll’s big-gun, Eddie Ar-
senault, scored all their points but
it wasn’t until an overtime period
had been played that the Red Cats
succumbed.

Vi-'estern Reserve tied Carroll in

the preceding game and were win-G

ning Tuesday night until Arsen-
ault broke lose fora goal in the
In the
overtime period, Arsenault let go
from far out to beat all—confer—
ence goalie, Berkeley for the win-
ning score.

Coach McSorley will use the
same defense strategy that proved
so successful against Arsenault in
the last Pitt-Carroll game which
iesulted in a 1-1 tie.

In that game Tatey Brittain
rode Arsenaut to_a fair-thee-well,
the big Carrollite breaking away
only once for a score, that being
from far out.

LOWE BACK

With the return of Bob Lowe to
the line-up, McSorley expects to
have a much more powerful of-‘
fense than he had in the Duquesne
series. Lowe will move into the
second line center post giving Pitt
a chance to alternate two top-
ﬂight offensive lines.

McSor1ey has been assured by
Lowe that although Bob will play
with a specially constructed cast
there won’t be any loss in efficien-
cy. Lowe tried the cast out in
practice up at the stadium and
felt no ill effects. V

Even with the team at full
strength for the ﬁrst time since
the Carnegie Tech game McSor-

ley isn't any too optimistic. John»

Carroll was snapped out of any

‘lethargy by the‘ inspiredeplay of

Western Reserve in their local

should be deter-¢

Iplayoffs and they will be in the
;best mental condition.

McSorley has intimated that
Pitt’s best chance lies in running
John Carroll ragged by frequent
substitution and high-speed play
throughout the series.

USE SUBS
The same situation faces Pitt
_that existed before. the last John
Carroll game. Tie-up Arsenault
{and overwhelm the Carroll’s with
i frequent substitutions. The strat-
legy worked ﬁfty-ﬁfty then, the

score being tie. The addition of
Lowe might. balance
Pitt’s direction.

With the Ice Follies occupying
the Duquesne Garden Ice the past
‘week, Coach McSorley took his
Icharges up to Hershey, ~Pa., ‘over
the week-end for stiff practice
drills. He was afraid. the puck-
men would lose their fine edge
without at least one session.

Practice on home ice will be
resumed today, the boys having
several days of black-board drill.

Riflers Shoot 1»
In Washington

Entraining with the hopes of
bringing back another trophy for
the Pitt collection, the Panther
1 riﬂe team left last night for Wash-
‘ington where they will compete
for individual and team honors in
the National Rifle Matches.

Captain Mitchell, riﬂe coach.
took with him the ﬁve men who
had the best averages throughout
the course of the yeas. The ﬁve
.n_ien were as follows: George
Mantzoros, team captain; C. K.
Hoffman, C. B. Matthews, Evan
T. Sage, J. S. Diefendorf, and C.
H. Courtwright. Accompanying
the team were Assistant Coach
Sargeant W. M. Hardison, and
Richard Irvin, manager.

Approximately twelve Eastern
colleges will compete in the
matches which will take place on
the George Washington Riﬂe
Range. The matches will end
Saturday afternoon and the team
will return the same evening.

The varsity riflersiboast a good

Just who won?

That may be a funny question
to ask,
writing Phi Kappa and Kappa
Sigma have not as yet gone to the
post. At the time of reading, the
game was over. It was played
last night, after deadline time.

PHI KAPS REVENGE

.Kappa Sigma, winner of League
B, defending champions, and fa-
vorites to usurp the basketball
trophy in Mr. Corley’s office, en-
te;ed the ﬁnals by defeating Pi
Kappa Alpha, runner up in the
League A, 34-30. Benny Kish re-
placed Johnny Micheloson as high
scorer for the champs with 12
points to Johnny's 10. George
Davies, selected as a forward on
League A’s all-star team, tied
Kish for scoring honors.

Phi Kappa, winner of League
;B, defeated Theta Chi in a play-
 game. This was somewhat of

a revenge for the Phi Kaps. In
last year’s play-offs, Theta Chi
p;otested Johnny Urban’s pres-
ence in Phi Kaps line-up and
the

Craig Street quintet.

HQLLJRRAN UP
Tommy Holleran,
hero in the Phi Kaps line-up was
the star of the game. Tommy
worked out with the Pitt varsity
at the beginning of the year but
was unable to keep pace with Dr.
Carlson’s passers. He was quite
capable of taking care of himself
on Tuesday night, however.

On Being Tapped
—--On Hearing ‘Taps’

Melvin Rogow.

BIGGEST popularity contest of the year, the I

studeiit elections are only three weeks off.
ODK and Druids are even now musing over
junior and freshman records in an endeavor to
choose outstanding men. The Owl’s Hall of
Fame will announce on Tap Day the 20 sen-
iors whose names, it has been felt, should go
down to posterity. Even Scabbard and Blade
is cogitating on possible tappees.

And a. few of the more serious—minded among
us are beginning to think about the annual
Peace Strike, or as milder minds would have
it, the Peace Assembly.

There ’s no obvious connection between these
two sets of facts, unless it be that of sharp con-
trast. \Vhich, we wonder, is the more signif-
icant, the recognition of success on the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh campus, or the attempt
to use this education we are absorbing as a,
means of clearing up some more pressing prob-
lems.

\Vhether we will be selected from our fellows
in a. campus election or a Tap Day seems just
a trifle less important in comparison to the
question of whether or not we all will be tap-
ped to “defend Democracy.”

Since everything that’s ever been said on
this subject has 11eve1' ended with a positive
statement, we’ll pose a question:

“If you had the choice of passing up Tap‘
Day honors next month, and then passing up
that other tapping we mentioned, would you
have any trouble making a decision?”

You Really Have
Nothing To Say

“T HE WEAKNESS of American democracy
today lies in the almost unrestricted pow-
er of any executive to create war situation
which Congress must accept, and the power of
Congress to make one decision which will
transform the whole nation.”——Senator Robert
M. LaFollette, Jr.

‘When Senator LaFollet.tc made this state-
ment he was urging thatthe American peo-
ple support a war referendum bill. Oppo-
nents of such a measure have rejected it on
various grounds, none of which, do we think,
are legitimate.

In the first place, it is practically unassaila.-
ble, since the authority of almost. every inform-
ed writer and historian agrees to the proposi-
tion that a war-minded president can carry the
nation to war without any effective check from
a people opposed to such &. move.
I A war referendum will not, as has been
charged, leave the nation defenseless. In case
of an attack on American territories, the Lud-
low bill provided that Congress could declare
war without referendum. The bi.ll only a.s-
sured the nation ’s right to vote on whether it
should ﬁght on foreign soil over foreign issues
in order to save American trade.

Carrying out the referendum would require
no longer than two or three days, according to
Admiral Samuel MacGowan, former Paymaster
General of the Navy. In 1917, Congress took
four days in which to decide.

It has been asserted that the electorate can
be as easily influenced toward voting for war
as can Congress.

It is conceivable that when Congress voted
to enter the World'War, a referendum might
have kept America out. The white heat of fury
had already subsided. The referendum would
certainly act as a deterrent to presidential ac-
tion leading us to war.

The principal ‘argument against the amend-
meent‘ is that a president should and must have
theutmost freedom in determining war poli-
cies because he knows best. It assumes that
theiparties who ﬁght should have nothing to
say. This argument for absolute power in pol-
icy-making politics smells of the tactics of Hit-
ler, Mussolini, and Stalin.

Sonnets
For The Very Young
By Milton G.

In startled Astonishment at our Comments upon the

Flippant Gentleman of the Northlands.

There is an awful lot that one might know
about the Arctic circles and all that,

about the frigid Northern Eskimo,
who lives alone and dines on walrus fat.

He lives and loves within a frigidaire,

he sits on ice cubes, munches frozen ﬁsh,
and has for company a polar bear,

who, by the bye, can make a tasty dish.

He sees the midnight sun for months on end,
and has a. wooing season once a year,

which I, off hand, would never recommend.
The season lasts six months. I guess that’s clear.

At. least he's worried not about elections,
tuberculin or Wasscrmann injections.

- and many stories dribbledgback

history see our inter-relationships with Europe and
the rest of the world and immediately become “in-
ternationaiists.”

International co-ope"ation for world stability is
a consummation devoutly to be wished for. But
there are times when we must forget the beauty of
abstract principle. If active disinclination to go to
iwar is isolation—good.

But, say the liberals, since our trade is so bound
up with the rest of the world, we cannot hope to
remain neutral if war is declared. Therefore, we
imust hop on the bandwagon and sock the fascists
iin the kisser before they conquer the world.

Who Can Tell . .

This logic suffers from the fallacy of incomplete
enumeration of possibilities. Who knows Whether
Hitler will not be satisﬁed now that he has taken
Austria? Why will he take Czechoslovakia when
he knows it“means almost certain’ war with England
and Russia? Is he also going to overrun a country
of 130,000,000 zealous Slavs fired with the religibn
of communism? -

Who can tell whether Japan; will ever pacify
China, a feat attempted over a period of several
thousand years by assorted Tarters, Mongols? Will
the Yellow Peril come across two thousand miles of
ocean to attack us?

If America is not going to be attacked, the only
way to stop a war to preserve our markets or the
property of Standard Oil in China is not to fight.
But accepting this hysteria of the inevitability of
conﬂict means that we must lose the active will not
to ﬁght.

If you want the “democratic” (but nevertheless,
imperialist) powers to stop fascism, you must be
willing to ﬁght for it. This ﬁghting will be done
under the guise of again saving democracy. You
will also be ﬁghting for the preservation of the
Have nations’ foreign investments.

‘This Good War’

The result of this war will be worse than that of
the last war; the internal condition which led to
fascism will not be remedied but aggravated. We
will have dictatorship at home during the ﬁghting,
naturally. '

Thus those who laugh at “isolation,” the interna-
tionalists who take the long view, must believe that
there are good wars and bad wars; they must sup-
port larger armaments in America, so that we will
be sure to win this good war.

And the tragedy of all this is that the most voci-
ferous advocates of this policy are well-meaning
liberals and the Communists, who have forgotten
all about their former bitterness against “imper-
ialist war-mongering.” -

If the radicals want to preserve the Soviet Union
from possible attack by Germany, let them say so,
and ﬁght in the army of the Soviet Union. But why
do they try to get America to do it for them, be-
hind the smoke screen of “collective security” to
preserve democracy?

If this be red-baiting, make the most of it.

If Reggie Johnson is still grumbling in his beard
here is the reason. At 9:45 Friday nite, arrayed in

and dialed Jane Pickard. “I’l1 ‘

cooed, but was coo-cooed by her
reply, “Sorry, but Herb Stoeklein

Get this fact ﬁrst: As far as
the administration is concerned,
every appointment is made

strictly on merit; no student is
e v e r selected
for any position
unless it be up-
on ' h i s 0 w n
qualiﬁcations
and record.

That w 0 r d
“qualiﬁcations,”
of course, is a
beautifully-com
ceived loophole
which permits
the use of the
argument that,
a.s far as dance
chairmanships
are concerned, fraternity men just

HAVE to be selected,‘ since only

they have organizedgsupport. "

Bill Stark, with peculiarly
Graustarkian logic, was arguing
the point with me Wednesday.
His argument goes this way:

BOYCOTT THREAT

“Now look, the fraternities are
crazy when they claim that only
a fraternity chairman can get sup-
port for a school dance. Why, if
the fraternities get rid of that idea
and support the dance anyway, a
good Independent can always put
on a good dance!”

To which I retorted: “And the
fraternities know that well enough
to use a boycott threat as the most
effective measure for getting a
fraternity man through the execu-
tive committee.”

With all that, I’m not convinced
that fraternity support will always
insure a successful dance. Take a
look at this past Interfraternity
Ball, as a shining example.

If any dance should have got-
ten fraternity support, the I-F‘
Ball was that dance. And yet,
the ﬁnal statement reported a net
loss of—Hold your hats, boys-—
$642. Either fraternity support
does not make 3. dance go over,
or there was dirty work afoot.
Draw your own conclusions.

’At any rate, Al Barr and his
Phi Kaps were assessed the tidy
amount of $92 to help make up
the deﬁcit. And the dance was
held during Lent, at that. There
ain’t no justice!

There’s' another side to the sub-

ject, however.

SOPH HOP DEBACLE

Let’s hark back to the dayswhen
we were sophomores, and D. C.
Schultz, you remember, obtained
chairmanship of the Soph Hop.
Interfraternity Council became
quite ired, since, at the time, fra-
ternity men were but poorly rep-
resented in SFA.

Under the leadership of Ed
Durkin, Kappa Sig and I-F presi-
dent, the Greeks staged a con-

Herbert

"Kappa Sig house:

 

certed boycott. Things came to a
pretty pass when, two days before
the I-lop, Schultz discovered that
approximately 35 tickets had been

sold. Even the Independents,
hearing the Fraternities were boy-
cotting the dance, didn’t think it

. .would be worth the tariff.

 

L _ FRATERNITY ADVANTAGE

Came the dramatic scene at the
Durkin, ada-
mant, arms folded, looks with dis,-
dain upon pleading sophomore

,. Schultz, almost in tears, ﬁnally re-
. lents.
‘ ‘we'll-taken, a.nd SFA has remem-
bered. itand used it to fraternity

But the» point has been

advantage.
This all came up when Stark

made out this‘ table for me:
» Frosh _ dance . . . . . . . . ..PiKA

Soph Hop  . . . . ..PhiiKa.p '

Junior Prom, . .f . . . . . . .Phi E1)

Spring Festival ' . . . . . . . . ._Delt '

Spring Dance” . . . . . . .Phi Kap ’

‘ A signiﬁcant list, to be sure, but
no. more than could be expected
after Durkin’s_gang had ‘scared the
administration into thinking their
way on the subject of gravy.

That brings up the subject of
this ycar’s gravy. Competent au-
thority hasit that after Wednes-
day afternoon’s fraternity coalition
meeting at the Phi ‘Gam house, the
juicy appointments for next year
have been judiciously distributed.
We wouldn’t be a bit surprised to
see the CA presidency stay right
at home on Belleﬁeld Street.
“Show the people the Light and
they will ﬁnd the way.”

LATEST LINEUP

Meanwhile the complexion of
the campaign has taken on an en-
tirely new color which, conﬁden-
tially, we haven’t been able to in-
tegrate by any known mathemat-
ically means. I think it has some-
thing to do with invariance, the
theory of ﬁnite groups, and cer-
tain aspects of the 13th roots of
one. And that’s about the time
mathematics starts entering philo-
sophy.

At any rate, these facts might be
salient:

1. Bernie Mclienna,
Independent, says: “I think I’ll
turn state’s evidence.” And then
he gives one of his personable
giggles.

2. Stark says that I don’t know
what’s going on; and I think he
dcesn’t know which way to turn
next.

3. Les Hamburg has a sinister
look on that Florida-browned face,
and John Chetfey, from the Delt
house across the street, has an
awfully wide grin.

4. The ZTAs may automatically
iron out their peculiar difficulties,
with the Tri-Delts tagging on be-
hind.

5. And, personally, we wouldn’t
bet a buck on Cashdollar.
