«The controversy over payment

A National Conference on Ra-

 cism. sponsored by tfie Students

for. a Democratic Society «SDS:
was held last weekend at City Col-
lege of New York and was attend-

J ed by approximately 500 people

3' ° from allover the US.

'l‘he conf’erence’s stated goals
were to "discuss the effects of
racism on the forces of social-
ist revolution in the ljnited States
and find ways to fight racist ideo—_
logy." The conference format was

_ .composed of general assembly
‘ speechesand small woi'kshops.

 Brief talks began the confer-
ence, emphasizing that the “strug-

gle against racism is a life and

death struggle for all of us.” One _

_ speaker then led the group in a

 Racism a Government

 

‘chant, “Students and Workers,
Black and _White—Must Unite!”
After the speeches the students
went to workshops including "ls
l’lot‘.""_
"Zionism. a Racist Ideology." and
"History of Racism."
The-members of Pittsburgh SDS
attended a seminar entitled

 .“l*‘lighting the Theories Bchintl

 

" the l’ract.ices."

which focused on
the idea recently put forth by

l  Professor Jensen of the l.t'niver-

 

~.sity of Connecticut. that whites

are more intelligent than blacks.
Jensen, it was -explained at the

workshop, uses IQ scores and

hereditary data to “prove” that

cviihites are by nature smarter

than blacks. Members of the

"workshop pointed out that IQ

scores‘ are biased in favor of-
middle-class people and there-
fore not valid indicators of true

I tfonn professor said tiiat .Jeii-
sens errors in the use oi heredi-
tary data were so blatant that he
"doubted ' Jensen's sincerity.

The professor explained that Jett-
sen used figures from a study oi
adopted children which showed

~ that the intelligence offadoptetl
, individuals could

not be pre-
dicted by the intelligence of their
foster parents. lie used this data
to argue that upbringing does not
affect intelligence.

The professor pointed otit that
Jensen ignored material in the
same study that showed that the
IQ of these children was on the
average 20 points higher than that
of their biological parents.

This data contradicts the idea
that [Q is inherited, and supports
the idea that a middle class up-
bringing" raises IQ, since most of
the biological parents were lower
class, and most of the adopting
parents were upper-class. The
U Conn professor said mistakes
like this abound throughout Jen-
sen's theory.

After the video—tape was shown.
workshop leaders pointed out that
Jensen and other racist theorist
were funded by the US govern-
ment ,through research grants.
The government then uses these
theories to justify cutbacks on
programs like Head Start on the
grounds that they cannot succeed
because blacks are genetically iii-
ferior. w-orkshops heads ration-

Another member pointed out
that “racist questions are being
asked for political reasons, to
destroy us.” An Ohio member
said that political figures in his
state were pushing for a bill to
impose sterilization on welfare
mothers after they have two ille-
gitimate-children. Such actions,
he argued, are made increasingly
possible by theories such as Jen-
sen’s.

Reading Course Repeated Spring Term

by KAREN BURGIO

What began as a pilot program

designed to help increase reading
speed and comprehension of in-
terested students last winter
term. the Counseling Center felt
met with such such success that
they will repeat the eotirses again
this term.

According to Georgine Mater-
niak. an instructor of the course
and a staff member in the Coun-
seling Center. students who took
the course increased their read-
ing comprehension by 85 per cent
and reading speed by 57 per cent.
The course was taken by students
ranging from from freshmen to
graduate levels.

“The course is structured to
be completely voluntary, with no
credit and no fee, and has been
very successful,” Materniak said.
“We polled a number of students
who responded to our ad in the

Pitt News concerning dissatisfac-
tion with their present reading
habits, and discovered that stu-
dents felt that their reading com-
prehension and speed were lack-
ing, and the program was design-
edywith those problems in mind.

"We now have applied for fed-
eral funding. so ‘that we may con-
tinue the course after this spring
session. and can buy better ma-
terials. The continuation of the
course next fall depends on wheth-
er or not we receive federal fund-
ing." »

The course will be offered from
May 1 to June 30 in one two hour
session per week and two one hour
sessions. The course has not yet
been closed for this term. but
Materniak stressed that each
session builds upon the next.

News in Summary   ,

Compiled from the
Associated Press

by KAREN BURGIO

WASHINGTON — FBI agents
were dispatched to the White
House Tuesday to guard Water-
gate files kept in the White House
by round the clock guards. as safe-
guarding procedure was begun to
“physically protect“ various
White" House documents.

* * *

The Senate told President Nix-
on Tuesday it wants the Water-
gate investigation taken out of
the executive branch and turned
over to a special prosecutor free
of any taint of bias. I

With no objections raised, the
Senate approved by voice vote a
resolution submitted by Senator
Charles Percy, R-Ill., who said
the White House should stop in-
vestigating itself.

Newly resigned presidental
aide John D. Ehrlichman told the
FBI he hired two men later con-
victed in the Watergate break-in
to investigate the Pentagon Pa-
per case.

Ehrichman said he later learn-
ed that the two men, Gordon Liddy
and E. Howard Hunt, had broken
into the office of Daniel Ells-
berg’s psychiatrists.

KENT, OHIO (AP) — Students I

at Kent State University began
a week-long memorial Monday
in memory of four students
who were shot and killed by Na-
tional Guardsmen during stu-
dent anti-war riots in May,
1970. "

Bob Gage, student body pres-
ident, said he believes the resig-
nation of U.S. Attorney General
Richard Kleindienst could en-

— danger the chances for a new
investigation of the killings.

\ Gage said Watergate has cast
a “gray cloud” over the Justice
Department, which under Klein-
dienst and former Attorney Gen-
eral John Mitchell, turned down
several appeals for a new look
into the tragedy.

Two films on the Kent State
killings were shown on the cam-
pus and activities, have been
planned for each day of the
memorial week.

Warning the nation faces po-
tentially severe gasoline short-
age this summer, Interior Secre-
tary Roger Morton urged Tues-
day that Americans voluntarily

“The driving habits of the
American people can determine

mer without a problem" or wheth-

Pill Sfuolenf Wins lsf
inPgh. Writing Contest

Debbie Popp of the Pitt News will be honored’ by the Pittsburgh
Chapter of the Women in Communications. Inc.. at its annual Matrix

Table luncheon Saturday, May 12.

Popp won first place in the chapters news category of its annual

Writing Contest. Her single story dealt with housing laxness which en-“ _ p ,0

couraged robbery of student rooms in Pitt dormitories.
The story appeared in the Jan. 15 Pitt News and described how

SDS Holds Convention

(Confirzuerl from Page 2)

It was further argued that just
as Hitlerﬂs theories were used to
justify the extermination of the
Jews. Jensens theories are being‘
used to justify discrimination
against blacks.

After the Saturday workshops,
SDS members participated in a
May Day Workers parade of 2,000
people. The workers and students
marched down\Broadway waving
red flags with the “Fight for So-
cialism” slogans on them, and
chanting “Que Viva Socialismo”
(Long Live Socialism).

On Sunday morning. a group -of
about 25 people from the Sparti—
cist League was turned away
from the gates of the conference
by a group of 50 SDS members.

The Sparticists are a radical
group who. according to Eddie Ar-
nold of SDS, “planned the total
destruction of the conference." ‘

After this incident, the confer-
ence reconvened with another

general assembly speech by a ' _
member of Minneapolis SDS. He‘ - 
emphasized racism’s central im- . 
portance in the oppression of the.‘ '

American people, saying, ,“Ra-
cist ideas not only hurt blacks,

but are used to keep black and ii.‘ ..l¢
white workers divided and fight-- ,
ing among themselves, thus hold- '5.‘-rvj

ing back the struggle for social-,
ism.”

He closed his speech by encour-
aging the members of the confer-
ence to go back to their local cam-
puses and "continue the struggle
to victory.". I .

A Harriedlnvoicee

By JOHN METCALFE

While everyone.‘s attention was on the Water-
gate and the sad charades which have accompan-
ied it. I got" to thinking about something entirely
else. The first matter is being examined with en-
ormous vigor and a great deal of skill elsewhere.
so I thought I would have time for whatever else
was going on. _

(Actually, I was hunting for a cartoonist to do
a»_dra'wing for me. I would have shown a man with

use of their eyes.

Sixteen miles from the site of the tragedy, the
Capitol Building of the State of California was
closed, for fear the explosions had weakened

its dome‘ to a dangerous extent.

tedious 'experien'ee,: and certain-
‘_ly' it is clear that the initiation‘
of a program such as mine would

a long nose in a turban, lamenting: “It isn’t «easy
to be Ali Baba when they take all your thieves ‘
away.” With inspiration like that cartoon, I could
have dealt with the Watergate as well as anybody
I can think of, but such was not to be the case.)

In- between the dumping of L. Patrick Gray
and the mass resignations on Monday, though.
some other things were going on in the world.

(Actually again," did you ever seesa sinking

ship kick the rats off before?)

Among the events of the weekend was the ex- ‘
plosion of a munitions train in-the near neighbor-
hood of Sacramentoqthe capital of California. It
wasla great-‘surprise to the residents. Bombs and
ammunition hadbeen pouring through their rail-
road facilities for yeais without incident. The rail-
road _employed people; bombs were a growth in-

. dustry. ‘ - ' .

-V Reports have‘ varied. but it is generally agreed
that the train was carrying about two million
pounds of “general-purpose"_ bombs. This sounds
like a lot of bombs to send through an.American
city or town. Actually,_.two million pounds of
bombsis only a thousand tons of bombs. A B-52"
. can -carry about thirty tons of bombs. Thus it is
clear that the _citizens were onlyexposed to the
effects of about thirty-five VB-52 loads of all-pur-

pose bombs.

These bombs were not aimed; they went off
of their own volition. In doing so, they eliminat-
ed a couple of small communities, injured a lot
of Americans, and closed down the homeof one
of our State governments. Thejexplosion occurred

Stunt Exress Cynicism About Watergate

     Editor's‘ Note

It has been said that college students are cynical: they say
we have lost faith in the American political system. They say
this loss of faith has resulted in poor turnout at the polls and :
possibly in our spotty attendance in political science classes. gs

"It's really disgusting the result of an overgrown beauracracy. I
doubt whether Watergate will have an effect on the structure of the
government——they will probably only be more careful next time." Sar-

ah Cohen. ‘

. WW’
"I think‘ it is unbelievable; I
have no more faith in the govern-
ment. I don’t know if Nixon knew
about it before but I’m sure he
tried to cover _it up,” Susie Ep-
stein.

"I think Nixon was tied up in
the whole scandal and I hope he is
found out. It is really no more
serious than dragging on the war,
and it’s not really shocking. We
all know this kind of thing goes on
allithe time,” Jeff Miller.

"I don‘t like Nixon. so it's hard
to be objective. I’m inclined to
think it is just another example of
how corrupt the government real-
ly is. One expects this kind of
thing from politicians," Debbie
Unger. A I

"I think it is standard operat-
ing procedure for the government

—-it’s.just the tip of the iceberg." '
Campus Police Officer Don Dor-

sey.

"Watergate is just the first
time that something like this has
come to head, the first time that
anybody got caught. But politics
has always been dirty, it has to
be. This is just proof how dirty

.politicians really are," Campus

Police Officer Lew Bremer.

THE CATHEDRAL OF LEARNING

  MONDAY nmu FRIDAY  
  7:30 A.M.»—8:30P.M.

A recent random sampling of
student opinion would suggest
that the analysts, as wrong as
they are about many things. are
accurate when they say college
students are cynical about the
government.

Students were - stopped and
questioned as to their knowledge

"of the Watergate affair, its sig-

nificance. it ramifications. The
following are pictures of several
students and brief quotes from
their statements about Water-
gate.

The general trend of these
comments. with few exceptions.
is that Watergate was just one
of many scandals and intrigues
which infest the American gov-
ernment.

"I'm glad that the news media
has continued to dig into the thing

and uncover the facts. Nixon‘s'

power will become‘ more control-

able. or he will get impeached. It‘

will certainlybe helpful for the
Democrats in the next election.
What surprises me the mostlis
that the Republicans even bother-
ed to take the risk——it was not

necessary.” Madelyn Greenlee. .

"It is a general indication of
the administrations lack of re-
spect for the Constitution?’ Lesle
Miller.

  

"I think its really overblown,
and just not as important as. peo-
ple are making it out to be. I don't
think though that it will have an
effect in that people will have less

faith in Nixon or the govern-

ment,” Jim Gregory.‘

"It was pretty careless and so

somebody got caught. But it isn't ‘
the first time that something like .

this has happened, they just didn't
get away with it. I would expect
this sort of thing from bureau-
crats, but not from Nixon. I’m
sure he wasn’t_ involved. Yes,- I
voted for Nixon, and would have
voted for him anyway had I known
everything that has come up about
Watergate," Tom Hasbach. ‘

"I think it is fantastic. It is the
best thing that has happened in a
long time. I always knew that Nix-
on was a schemer and a cheat.

 Hoirse RaCing’s ”Super Bow

by LARRY PANSINO
For various unknown reasons.

.a collection of annual sporting

events in America have become
true classics, engendering tremen-
dous interest among fans who
otherwise pay little attention to
that particular sport.

Among these events are pro
football’s Super Bowl, baseball’s
World Series, auto racing’s In-
dianapolis '500, and the Boston
Marathon. This Saturday one of
these classics takes place at an
old race track in Louisville, Ken-
tu,cky—the Kentucky Derby.

Tradition has handed down the
Derby as the premier American
horse race. But as the 99th renew-
al of the race approaches, there

‘ seems no good reason why this‘

mile-and-one-quarter stakes at

. Churchill Downs for which only

three-year-old thoroughbreds are
eligible should become the big
one, rather than, say, a mile gal-

' lop for all comers at Saratoga

in August.

For whatever reasons, though.
the Kentucky Derby has indeed
reached a prominence in inter-

_ national racing shared only by the

English Derby at Epsom. Eng-
land, and France’s Prix de l’Arc
de Triomphe.

Most horse owners, trainers and
jockeys rank la Derby victory as
one of their foremost goals and
thrills. Top three-year-olds are in-
variably prepared for this race
and entered if any chance of
winning exists-—- and sometimes
even if it doesn’t.

The Derby attracts broader

segments of the sporting popu-

lation. than just the horsemen.

Thousands of fans and curious
observers converge on Louisville

during the week preceding the
event. More than 130,000 peo-
ple paid a minimum of $3 a head
to get into Churchill Downs on

Derby Day.

With such a drawing card with-
in itscity limits, the Louisville
Chamber of Commerce has done
its utmost to capitalize on the
race, using it to yield an annual
financial_ bonanza for the city
and its businesses.

A week-long festiva-l prior to
race day is organized, sponsored

and promoted by the city, fea--

turing such events as a river
boat race, parade, art show and
horsemen banquets. It is impos-
sible, to rent a hotel or motel
room for only one day during the
weekend of the Derby; one must

take the. room—already at higher V
' than normal rates—for three days.

Yet the people come, from in-
numerable and widely scattered
homes, to take part in the tradi-
tion. pagentry and drama of the
race, to experience “the thrill of
being there."

The grandstand can accommo-
date about 50,000 but a ticket to
one of these seats is harder to
procure than an invitation to an
Inaugural Ball. 0

Holders of these tickets invar-
iably exercise their right to re-
new their franchise to these
seats each" year. Thus the tickets
become family or corporation
hairlooms that a holder trea-
sures until death and then passes
on to his descendants.

So those who wish to simply
drop in on a Derby one year
must resign themselves to sitting
on the grass within the track oval
——the infield. The track has install-

»ed refreshment stands, souvenir

shops. rest rooms. and mutual
betting windows. but the infield
fan can see little of the race.

Only those infield infielders
very close to the tracks inside
edge can view even a part of
what everyone has gathered here

to see. The overwhelming num-"

ber of them within the outer ring
of spectators can only sit there.
place their bets. read. relax ‘or
do practically anything except
watch horses run. .

The lines for infield tickets be
gin forming outside Churchill
Downs about midnight the night
before. The Derby is still some
20 hours off‘ and the race itself
blasts but two minutes.

Practically none of these peo-
ple will see more than a small
fraction of it. But the lines are
there. Young people are scatter-
ed around the main entrance. sit-
ting on the grass. sleeping in
blankets, or singing.

The gates open at 8 a.m. the
next day. Within a half hour a
good number of people have as-
sumed squatters' rights on ‘a par-
ticular piece of the infield grass.
laid claim to it with a blanket
spread down, and are roaming the
grounds.

This freedom of movement
will be only a memory by 11 a.m.,
when enough blankets will have
been deposited so aslto prohibit
walking without stepping on
these blankets or the people
stretched on them.

By noon the reserve grandstand
seats are only sparsely occupied
and won't be filled until nearly
5 p.m., 40 minutes before post
time. ’

Nine other races besides the
Derby are run at the Downs.

the first at 11:30. Bettors ponder
over their programs and Racing
Forms, then weigh the morn-
ing line odds. betting patterns

with the confetti of torn mutual

seated losers and tossed up from
the masses of the infield.

Because of the restricted move-
ment of the infield, it becomes

‘Cheerleaders’ Rates No Cheers

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN

The Cheerleaders, a new mov-
ie presently showing at the Kings
Court Theatre in Oakland. deals
with thosegallant young men
and women who fight, literally
with everything they‘ve got. for
their respective schools. It might
easily be seen as a brilliant ex-
pose of the action behind lines
of highschool football——or on the
other hand, it might be more
easily seen as an expose of the
insanity of Hollywood produc-
ers of fourth-ratepornography.

High school football for me
and my fellow classmates. was
always a pure, romantic. active.
healthy sport where we forgot
the pettiness of puberty and the
abominations of early post-adol-
escence.

The Cheerleaders, directed and
produced by Paul Glickman, pre-
sents a very different picture of
high school football than my own.

‘Glickman’s team is composed
of beautiful and altogether im-
moral young cheerleaders and a
sex’-starved, sexist and moronic
group of football players. who
by means of every one of the
favorite positions and plays suc-
ceeds in a winning season. Not
only is that all-American game
reduced to the level of sexual
perversion. it is also taken down
from its honored positionof be-
ing a fair and truly soul-build-
ing sport. A

And so, since the film seems
so unsatisfactory as a expose of
high school football and its relat-
ed activities, it becomes neces-

sary to speak of it as the result

of a Hollywood director's ima-
gination. as fourth-rate porno-
graphy. " 0

Our good friend in the Coun-
ty.Commissioners office, D. A.
Duggan, and many specialists in
pornography feel that such pro-
ductions should have a certain
degree of
value.” Glickman’s film certain-
ly does not.

The story it tells suggests that

the best fornicator_s always win.
and that if you cheat and lie.

“socially redeeming ’

and make enough bets behind
people's backs. then you will
not only secure in a winning sea-
son for your school. but you will
have tremendous fun to boot.

This moral does not appear to
be heavily laden with value for
men like Duggan. The-film in
shortdoes not meet the first cri-
terion of good fourth-rate por-
nography. -

As for the second criterion, one

‘must answer the simple question

of how well performed, how
varied and how well photograph-
ed arethe sexual activities of
the film. The Cheerleaders, since
it deals almost exclusively with
post-adolescent advances into
the world of human physicality,
does not present an impressive
array of sexual activities. Fella-
tio buffs, for example disappoint-
ed.

The pornographic segments of
The Cheerleaders are just that.
sourly disappointing— infants
make love in the backrooms of
hamburger joints, the back seats
of cars that are being washed.
and quickly, oh so clandestine-

ly. in suburban living rooms.

And‘ at that. the participants
stay .dressed. or are photograph-
ed so that they are either too
obscured to be interesting. or so
uninteresting that they should
be obscured.

This photography of obfusca-
tion, however, is done with a
complete lack of sensitivity, and
for that matter, of taste. The
scenes are always brightly light-
ed and the sets are always drea-
ry and prosaic. Little, in fact,
provides aesthetic stimulation
and the film remains a dismal
failure.

Glickman’s film, anaesthetic
and sensual desert. is a dis-
grace. With The Cheerleaders,
this practically unknown direct-
or will more than likely achieve
some recognition-— let" us hope
that this recognition is ignomide.

For the film proves once again
that Hollywood can't do porno-
graphy, and that pornography
is not for high school football
players, nor for those whose lives
are spent in servicing them.

Records-—“More on the
Best of the Latest"

by BARBARA GERAUD
Beck, Bogert & Appice (Epic) isn't quite as good as the trio are
in concert. but it's one helluva debutalbum. Jeff Beck has been
one of the kings of British blues. and Tim Bogert and ‘Carmine Ap-
pice were the driving force behind Vanilla Fudge and Cactus. ’

They've been trying to get together for about three years. and
this album provides ample evidence that this liason was worth the.
waiting. Highlights include “Sweet Sweet Surrender," and their ver-
sions "of Curtis Mayfield's “I‘m So Proud." and Stevie Wonders
"Superstition." both definitely English versions’ of these American
soulsounds.

Beck’s guitar -work has never beenbetter. His long absence from
the music scene because of his motorcycle crash hasn’t hurt his play-
ing nor lessened his awareness of what’s been happening in his ab-
sence.

Bogerts bass sounds more like a lead guitar than a rhythm in-
strument. Not merely-content to follow Appice’s driving beat. he takes
off on wildly melodic tangents which somehow coalesce into a mag-
nificent harmony with the other two. . -

* >I< * * * >I= =I< * * *

Then there's Ray Davies and the Kinks‘ latest invasion into in-

sanity: The Great Lost Kinks Album (Reprise). The title refers to the -

fact that in early 1969, there was supposed to be a Kinks album en-
titled Four More Respected Gentlemen.

For some reason this was never released.‘ Some of the tracks ap-
peared on the Village Green Preservation Society Ip, but the rest dis-
appeared into near oblivion, only to be rescued for this sequel to
the Kink Kronikles lp of last fall.

So it's.not new stuff. and if you're not into the Kinks‘ earlier
material. this may be just a big passe‘. It is.‘ however. still bona
fide Kinks. and as such interesting for both its evolutionary value
_and as good rock ‘n‘ roll. Four of Dave Davies’ ‘songs are included.
among them "There is No Life Without Love." _a truly beautiful
song.

Unique Program   offered

by JOHN SMITH
Arts Editor

The University’s Men‘s Glee

A Club, under the direction of Phil-

ip Cavanaugh, is the oldest extra-
curricular organization on cam-
pus. Founded in 1890 as the “Man-
dolin and Banjo Club" by 12 stu-
dents, it has expanded to include
40 undergrads from all parts of
the University.

_The repetoire of the club in-
cludes sacred masses. classical
works, English glees and madri-
gals, folk songs, spirituals, drink-
ing songs, and contemporary,se-
lections, in several languages.

The group also has the distinc-
tion of being one of the few chor-
al groups in the United States to
perform a costumed, staged, chor-
eographed and. instrumentally ‘ac-
companied musical production of
completely American music.

Also included in each show will
be performances by the smaller
groups within the organization.
The Pitt Tunes present barber-
shop harmony, and a folk trio adds

- _more diversity with several pop-

ular selections.

’on April 22. the Glee Club em-
barked on its annual spring tour

. which culminated in an appear-

ance at the Intercollegiate Musi-

‘cal Council Convention. Quite a .

thrill according to the group's”
newly elected president. Mike

Schnitzler. because they were the ‘ in

only club outside of Georgia to
be invited to the affair.

The tour itself ran eight days
and started at Lees-McCrae Col-

by Pill Men's Glee Club,

lege in Banner Elk, N. C. Then
the group hit Atlanta for a week-
end of concerts which were higly
praised by those who attended.

_First on the agenda was Em-

ery College, near Atlanta. Early -

the nextmorning. they opened the
festivities of the-IMC with the
cabaret-type of show which has
put them in such great demand.

The day’s activities included
seminars dealing with the prob-
lems of Glee Clubs as experienced
by such organizations around the
country. That evening, a program
featuring the organizations from
Georgia was featured. with the
Pitt group joining with all the col-
leges for the Testament of Free-
dom. a rousing number which re-
ceived a standing ovation at its
conclusion. ‘

The tour ended in Knoxville at
the University of Tennessee with
an impromptu concert in the quad
of the school. This is Philip Cav-
anaugh’s last tour. '

The group’s innovative work

drew mixed reactions from the‘

officials who attended the semi-
nar. Most were quite pleased at
the _idea of a Broadway-type show.
Some of the more conservative
directors, however, were a ‘bit
displeased at this new approach
to choral programming. '
Schnitzler explains that even
though this facet of the act is
very important. there is still just
as- much effort devoted to the
more serious side of the music.
In the past few years, they have

A ten day layoffdue to the
rainy. cold weather we've been
having showed, its effect Tues-
day as the Pitt baseball team was
defeated by Bucknell University:
3-2. The weather ‘kept the Pan-
thers from even practicing out-
side for ten days. ,

Since pitchers can practice in-
doors easier than hitters. it was
no surprise'that the game "was
a pitchers’ duel. Bucknells Don’
Correnti, who "pitched the en-

' tire_ game. gave up only two hits.
. both to Dennis Toboz. Panther

pitching yielded only four hits. .
’ Toboz was the entire offense
for Pitt; In the bottom of the

_ fourth inning, he put ,Pitt ahead

1-0..'with a homer to right field
which sailed over the 377-foot

‘ -mark. In the eighth inning, with »

Pitt trailing 2-1, the Homestead"

senior lined a triple down. the 1

right [field line, scoring Denny-
Levish, who got aboard’ on a base-
on-balls. ' ' ‘

nBucknel‘l didn't have any proli-A

gfic, blasts enroute to their three

‘runs. In the fifth inning, two
misplayed‘ bunts down the first- '
base line loaded tlie“bases, and

Since the Johnny Majors Con-
struction Company arrived in
Pittsburgh in January. and more
precisely since Spring football
drills began back on April 6. the
changes that had been predicted
in Pitt football are indeed begin-
ning to take form. But yet nothing
MAJOR seems to be taking place.
It's too early. -

There have been surprises like
Mike Mehalik in the month of
April; the quitting of 12 scholar-
ship players has provided enough
disappointment along with the
rain. and at least one walk-on is

A daring to become a May flower by

fighting off the holdover and in-
coming ‘talent. in an attempt to
earn himself a position on the

Panther football roster.

When Pitt opened spring drills.
107 gridders took the field. Now.
only 62 are able to play. But. it's
not as bad as it sounds.

In addition to the elimination of
the dozen scholarship players
(two transfers, Joe ‘Fasulo and
Dave August); four medical dis-
abilities, and six who just plain
quit,
gone by the boards. The other 21
make up the corps of walking
wounded.

Amidst this muck of human fail-
ure (discounting the walking
wounded) at least one success
story is blooming. '

His name is Ed Cahill. he's at
Skyscraper U on a swimming
scholarship. and he seems ready

12 walkons have already_

to join Reggie Frye and Todd
Toerper as another walkon mak-
ing good.

Presently playing at defensive
tackle, the 6-3, 220 Cahill’s only
previous football experience con-
sisted on ninth and tenth grade
play at Carrick High School. Af-
ter admitting some failure for not
pursuing football in his last two
years of elementary school, Ca-
hill further admitted that he want-
ed a college education and that
swimming was the open gate.

"I wanted to go to college." Ca-
hill said. adjusting the bandage on
his forehead. “I know that for

some reason a lot of City League
football players get overlooked. I
don't know why. but look at Ted
Berrien (a fellow City Leagueri.
He's good.

and he only got

Armchair QB’s Not For   Cahill

a couple of offers to go to col-
lege. For me, swimming looked
best in high school."

Sensing that he would not play

much‘ under the new system. one \’

of the gridders who has left the
squad, “Why should I bust my be-
hind for nothing." while he was
tuigning in his gear. Another said.
“I've given it everything I've got
and I'm still running fourth
team.“

Coupled with the fact that Pitt
has had its best recruiting year
in its long history—-one Pitt offi-
cial close to the picture has warn-
ed not to be too surprised if the
final total is above '59—what
would make a kid like Cahill

‘think that he could make it as an

unknown and even get recognized

SOPHOMORE Ed Cahill (76) is at-
tempting to make it as a walk-on
Johnny Maiors’ football team. At
Pitt on a swimming scholarship, the
Carrick High School graduate “has
a chance,” according to his coach,
Jim Dyer. '

Cahill is seen in action last Sat-
urday in the weekly scrimmage at
Pitt Stadium as a defensive tackle.
He will get one more chance to
impress the coaching staff on May
5 in the annual Blue-Gold intra-
squad game.

es’ minds.

His answer was not ‘an original
one and he used a very bountiful
American pastime to help pro-
vide an answer. All young men
must surely dream of excelling in
athletics and Ed Cahill isn't any

different.

"I’ve always wanted to play."
he said in manner that has been
heard innumberable times. "A lot
of guys‘ find themselves them-
selves sitting.in armchairs call-
ing the plays. I want to know that
at least I tried.

‘‘It’s a do or die proposition for
me right now. If I make‘ it good,
if not I’ll be siting in the stands.”

' Cahill, however, seems to be
winning his war. He has succeed-
ed where 99 per cent of walk-ons
fail. He has made the coaching
staff aware; he has been noticed.
In fact, the name Cahill has blurt-
ed out of defensive line coach Jim
Dyer's mouth with . increasing
regularity.

“I guess they noticed me by all
the mistakes I made,"_smiled the
friendly sophomore. But, Dyer
has a more concrete explanation.

“I first put him there because
of all the injuries (Dave Janaci-
sin and Paul Marinao), but he’s
been a pleasant surprise. He

I seems like agreat kid who works

hard and has great determination
and devotion. That’s the reason
a lot of people make it. I’m not
going to say that he’s going to be
a_ starter or that he’s even going
to play, but he’s got a chance. I’m

g impressed.”

Of course, spring drills aren't
as important as summer camp.
That's where Cahill will have to
win a job; do battle with all the
incoming people. And if he thinks
this is tough, wait until Johns-
town. '

"This is definitly tough," Ca-
hill added. “Compared to what
I’ve done in my whole life, this
is one of the toughest things both
physically and mentally.«I like it
though and I hope they like me.”

Does Cahill really likegetting
beat up on?

“As far as I‘m concerned, I.
consider myself doing the beating
up," he said. '1

Dyer is right. Cahill does have
a chance.’

“We’re going to be weak in the

"We were hoping to take the
one-two in the hurdles with Andre
there, but now it will be up to Bill
Kalchalter. Ernie’s injury and
inactivity makes him a question
mark. I don't know how much he
had forgotten.

But Banner hopes his boys Will
do well in both the high Jumping
and the steeplechase. which will
be run tor the first time in a dual
meet. Tim Riley and George Jup-
in will jump for the Cats. while
Mtckey Collins and Rich .\larkle_\
will hurdle the steeplechase.

"We have more outstanding
athletes than they do." the men-
tor said. in announcing his solu-
tion to the problem.

For instance, Rich Jackson will

run the quarter mile, 440 yard
hurdles, the'440 yard dash, and
the mile relay. Jumping special-
ist Bill Rea will run the 100 yard
dash, throw the javelin, run the
440 yard relay, and the 220 yard
\ dash along with his long and triple
jump duties. All the other track-
sters will put in similar service.

"i know you can use one ath-
lete only so much." Banner noted.
"but these are all good athletes
who want to win an_d ltii sure
theylldoit.“ ‘

Banner's track team hasii i lost
a dual meet since they were de-
feated by Temple back in 1968
and hevisnit going to concede
this one yet. Because he feels a
good solution will lick a tough
problem any day.
