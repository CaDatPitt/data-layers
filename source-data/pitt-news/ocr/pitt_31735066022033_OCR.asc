”When a police officer is shot
they are not shooting an in-
dividual, they aré shooting the
system. It's a retaliation against
the type of system, the authority,

that is present in this country. We ,

resent that because we are the
system,”
— Sgt. Dave Allman

It is not very often that a police
officer hears the words, ”shots
fired — officer down,” come over
the radio, butwhen it does hap-
pen, he responds with more in-
tensity than normal.

Such was the case Friday after-
noon when Pittsburgh Police
received a call from a man who
identified himself as Mark Brown.
Brown, whose real name is
Michael Anderson, told police
that an officer had been gunned
down at the University Inn at the
corner of Forbes Avenue and
McKee Street, Oakland.

When a call like this comes
over the radio, all officers within
the corporate boundaries of the.
city respond.

H ”You drop whatever you are

1 doing and go,” Sgt. Dave Allman ‘

said. ”Everybody responds as fast

you are doing and go.
Everybody responds as
fast as possible.

as possible, and you don't give a
crap about too many other things.
”Some of us drive with reckless
abandon during a call like that,”
said Allman. ’’I made it from here
[_Police'Station 6 on North Um-
‘ berland Street in Squirrel Hill]
down to Forbes and McKee in a
little under three m_inutes.”
Friday's incident brought ap-
proximately 35 officers to the
University Inn, including Chief of
Police William Moore, the pub-
lic safety director and the watch
commander.
‘ ”|t’s a wonder somebody
\.didn’t get killed because we had
officers everywhere,” acting Lieu-
tenant John O’Keefe said. ”We
thought an officer was down,
dead or wounded, and we're go-
ing through red lights and every-
thing else.” .
According to Allman, proce-
dures are altered when an officer
is shot. Police are put on first
alert, and two doctors, two rescue
trucks and three medics rush to

the scene.

’’If in fact an officer haddbeen
shot, the medics would have
never got him‘ because the first
car on the scene would scoop the
officer up, throw him in the car
and drive him to the hospital,”
said Allman. ”He would be in the
care of physicians before the
medics would have even got
there.”

It is also a dangerous situation
for the public. ”People don't un-
derstand what we're doing when
they see all of the cars coming
into the area,” Goncar said.

When police arrived at the
University lnn, they observed a
scene of chaos, with people run-
ning in all directions and traffic
a mess. .

They found Anderson drinking
at the bar. According to the
police "report, Anderson told
police he had seen a man armed
with a machine gun that was hid-
den under his long, brown coat.

”He actually believed that it
happened,” Allman said.

Anderson, 24,’ was charged
with risking catastrophe, filing a
false police report and failing to
prevent a catastrophe. He is be-
ingﬂheld at the county jail on
$50,000 bond. Anderson's hear-

"ing is scheduled for March 23.

Pitt black alumni

receive recognition

cluding an award for John&Cil-F

By Frances Sansig
Contributing Editor

Black achievers from as far
away as California gathered to
receive special awards of recog-
nition for their contributions to
the black community at the Bi-
centennial Black Awards
Banquet

The banquet, held Saturday
night in the William Pitt Ball-
room, specifically honored black
alumni of the University of Pitts-
burgh. Thirty—four awards were
presented to such diverse leaders
from K. Leroy Irvis, thefirst black

speaker of the Pennsylvania

House of Representatives, to
Catherine Tabb-Powell, a
48-year-old mother of five who is
currently attending law school
and who recently served an in-
ternship with U.S. Representative
Walter E. Fauntry’s office.

’’I think black people in this
community need to know more
about black people,” said Irvis.
’’It’s important to have role
models. It's. important for white
“children to know that not all
good ideas come from white
skulls.”

Several posthumous awards
were presented to relatives, in-

mer, the first black graduate of
Pitt (class of 1897), who was
described as ”a forerunner for
everyone here today.”

As Irvis stepped up to receive

his award, ‘Anne Jones from the q I 

School of Social Work said, ”He
is indeed the’ speaker of all the
people in the state of Penn-
sylvania.” .

Jack Daniel,‘ associate provost‘

at Pitt, was hailed as ”instrumen-

tal in beginning the black studies .

department,” as he received his
award toa standing ovation. _

Dennis Brutus, chairman of the
black studies department,
thanked Robert Hickey, chairman
of the Bicentennial Commission,
for his dedication to the cause.

”We are all very grateful to the
Bicentennial Commission for the
money that made this event
possible.

’’It’s time to look back on the

achievements of thepast.  This
is a very special occasion for the
black‘ alumni of the university,”
said Brutus. ' I «

According to Hickey, ”This  V.‘  
truly a fun kind of event. ..._The .

commission has sought to draw

attention to the outstanding work

of our alumni.”

Immunity is considered for keys in Contra affair

WASHINGTON —— Congress is
considering granting immunity to
key figures in the Iran arms affair
before its investigators have inter-
viewed all the staff members who
worked directly for former Na-
tional Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter.

”All I can sayiis that's not the
classic way to go about it,” said
James F. Neal, who was associ-
ate special prosecutor in the
Watergate case.

”You want to interview all the
people at the lower level you
could  before you escalate on
up,” he added.

Aides to the House and Senate
investigating committees have
talked to Florence Gantt, Poin-
dexter’s secretary at the Nation-
al Security Council, she said in an
interview. But they have not
questioned Rodney B. McDaniel,
former executive secretary at the
National Security Council under
Poindexter.

Trustees reject ban on

future financial ties
HERSHEY, Pa. — Supporters of

tougher limits on Penn State

University's financial ties to
South Africa said the university's
image will suffer after its trustees
rejected a ban on new invest-
ments in the racially torn country.
”It doesn't add to our luster,”
trustee Richard L. Trumka said of
the 19-1 1 vote Saturday. The vote
defeated a measure that would
have prohibited investments in
companies doing business in
South Africa as a protest against
that country's system of forced ra-
cial segregation, or apartheid.

Study pinpoints place

WASHINGTON —— Mozam-

The analysis, called the ”Inter—

ing,” was released Sunday by the
Population Crisis Committee. Us-
ing data from a variety of sources,
the committee developed a nu-

WASHINGTON — The air-

Local group contests proposed buildingof hotel  

By Michele Quinn
Staff Writer

The Schenley Farms Civic As-
sociation, a local neighborhood
group, is against the proposed de-

, velopment of an Oakland parking

lot into a nine-story hotel.

"Every hotel attracts a lot of
nice people and a lot of unnice
people,” said Kenneth Behrend,
association president. ”We don't
want to attract unnice people to
our neighborhood.” '

The building of the 199—suite
hotel is being proposed by the

National Corporation of Oakland
According to a March 11 arti-
cle in The Pittsburgh Press, the
city Planning Commission will
hold .a public hearing on March
24 concerning the subdivision of
the land now being used as a
parking lot behind the Masonic
Temple and Syria Mosque on Ba-
yard Street at Bigelow Boulevard. -
According to Behrend there is
concern about the traffic conges-
tion caused by the removal of the
parking lot. ”However,” he said,
”we are more concerned with the
liquor license that would be au-
tomatically granted to the hotel.

»~Mar.athon raises
$21,000 for charity

By Marc Duchin

Sta ff writer

For 24 hours members of Pitt's
fraternities and sororities danced
to raise money for Harmarville
Rehabilitation Center in the annu-
al Greek Week Dance Marathon.

The marathon, lasting from 6
p.m. Friday, March 13 to 6 p.m.
Saturday, March 14, was held at
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
and raised $21,000 from
sponsors. -

”Fraternities and Sororities go
out and get pledges,” said Liz
Habib, co-supervisor of the mara-
thon. ”They get_direct’s'ponsers;
a business or person would send
them a check saying ’l’|| sponser
you a dollar per hour.’ ”

According to Habib, everyone I

must dance 24 hours and have a

house dancing and has the most
money, wins a trophy. The dance
marathon is responsible for one
third of the total $62,000 goal of
Greek Week. I

The Penn State Dance Mara-
thon, held on Feb. 20 through
Feb. 22, raised $297,311 for the
four diamondfund at Hershey
Medical Center and is complete-
ly separate from their Greek
Week, according to Val Chaven—
son, overall supervisor of Penn
State's marathon.

“Penn State's Greek Week is
for the. celebration of being Greek
and is not a charitable function,”

_ said Chavenson.

”They [Penn State] dance 48
hours,” said Habib. ’’It is a huge
drive up there, they don't have
any other charity events going on
at the same time.”

"A few years ago the Syria
Mosque tried to get a liquor dis-
pensing area on the premises. We
argued against it. The liquor
board and the common pleas
complaints court agreed that
granting the liquor license would
be a misuse of the zoning princi-
ple,” said Behrend.

The proposed sight for the
hotel is 40 feet from the Syria
‘Mosque.

”We feel that the building of
the hotel would not only affect
the Schenley Farm Asssociation,
but also the Pittsburgh Athletic

- Association, the Temple and the

   
 

Syria Mosque,” said Behrend.

The neighborhood group also
feels that the hotel would lower
the property values of houses in
the area.

”Even now we find in the
neighborhood beer and whiskey
bottles,” said Behrend.

The group contends that the
removal of the parking lot would
cause traffic problems in an al-
ready congested area. I

However, according to the ar-
ticle in The Pittsburgh Press ”a
planning department study
reportedly shows traffic would
not be adversely affected with the

construction of ahotel.”

* James Cortez of National De-
velopement, said in an interview
with The Pittsburgh Press that the
"proposal is still only that— a
proposal. It's capable of change.
We'll know more in, a month.”

Behrend and the Schenley

-Farms Civic Association have .

hired a lawyer.

”_We feel that the law of the
zoning is on our side,” said’
Behrend.

The city Planning Commission
could not be reached I" for
comment. i

Segregation still
hangs onat Pitt

Greek Week and its many activities annually promote the
success of the Greek system at Pitt. The overall purpose of Greek
Week is to bring the separate sororities and fraternities together
with one objective -— to raise money for a deserving charity.

This is accomplished with both class and integrity, but there
is one problem. One group of Greeks — and a very important
group at that _— annually do not take part in Greek Week. We
are referring to the black Greeks. ’

Blacks and whites have made unified efforts on a wide range
of projects at Pitt — from taking a stand against apartheid to
cheering Pitt on at a basketball game. Why can't they get
together for Greek Week?

This university has seen both good and bad times as far as
black/white relations are concerned. Now, as it begins its third
century, the university should be concerned with promoting
better inter-racial relations. ’

The current Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Board are
perhaps the best this university has had in a while. The Office
of Student Activities, through these two boards, should attempt
to better black/white relations within the Greek system. The

_- place to start is with next year's Greek Week.

This year's Greek Week has been great. With black partici-
pation, next year's Greek Week could be better.

Hazing’s a crime
and a darn shame

Hazing among Greek organizations is something that, thank-
fully, is becoming a thing of the past. Practices that once stood

' to prove the worthiness of aiprospective member, digressed

to the level of cruel and unusual punishment. Initiation rites
came to include forced consumption of alcohol, psychologi-

. cal, verbal and physical abuse. The severity of hazing increased

and became a scandal that was crying out for attention.

That attention became law on November 18, 1986 when the
Pennsylvania State Senate passed its first anti-hazing law. Any
and all forms of hazing are now illegal in this state. At long
last, hazing is a thing of the past, or is it?

For the third time in a little more than a year, a Greek or-
ganization at Pitt has been suspended amid allegations of haz-
ing. The February 27, 1986 issue of The Pitt News carried a
front-page story concerning the suspension and pending inves-
tigation of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Apparently, Alpha Phi
Alpha brothers from the IUP chapter physically abused two
pledges from Pitt. The two pledges protested to the fraternity’s
alumni, and the investigation was launched.

Alpha Phi Alpha is to be commended for their openness and

» willingness to set the record right through this investigation.

They're taking this well, but it never should have happened
in the first place. Sanctioned violence is medievaland unac
ceptable regardless of the circumstances. :

-Pennsylvania has a law against it. Pitt has a policy prohibit-
ing it, but laws and policies are worthless unless they are en-
forced. The case of Alpha Phi Alpha should be seen as an
example of what could-be for all of the Greek organizations
at Pitt. Hazing is a dangerous practice and, hopefully, on its
way to becoming little more than a bad memory. _

PERSPECTIVE  

  4

Monday, March 16, I987

 
  

 
  

      
 

 

In recent weeks, Mikhail Gor-
bachev’s efforts to reform the
Soviet Union from within have
come under close scrutiny. Some
say the changes are designed to
benefit the Soviet economy;
others fear they are aimed at
strengthening Russia's strategic
position vis—a-vis the West. Who
is right?

Neither. Or perhaps both, de-
pending upon one’s perspective. ,
The fact is, Gorbachev’s efforts
cannot be evaluated from an
either/or perspective. As. is so
often the case in superpower re-
lations, a complex of motivations

is involved. To be sure, Gor-

bachev would like to loosen up
the Soviet bureaucracy. Com-
munism is slowly strangling Rus-
sia, and the only ones who won't
admit this, at least publicly, are
the party members whose pow-
er derives from the rest of the
country's economic malaise.
But regardless of his primary in-
tentions, Gorbachev can't help
but realize the international
ramifications of reform. A U.S.
public and Congress which be-
lieves the Soviet Union to be
preoccupied with its domestic af-
fairs — a U.S. public and Con-
gress which increasingly comes
to reject the notion that the

releasing a few dissidents Gor-
bachev is pulling the rug from un-
der the president’s feet. What the
Soviet leader could not accom-
plish via the Iceland Summit, he
is endeavoring to achieve via the
American media. Given Russia's
new ”liberalized” stand, it will
be increasingly difficult for Rea-
gan to convince the American
people of the necessity of such
programs as the Strategic Defense
Initiative and aid to the Contras.
Perhaps, though, the main rea-
son for the effectiveness of Gor-
bachev’s efforts has not been
their nature but rather their tim-
ing. It seems there is somewhat
of a correlation between the Iran
Contra Affair and Soviet talks of
domestic reform. As Americans
come to lose faith in the presi-
dent, Gorbachev, no doubt, real-
ized that the U.S. public might
simultaneously no longer accept
Reagan's characterization of the
Soviet Union. Hence, he moved
swiftly to capitalize, clamoring
ever—more about domestic
changes as the President's
popularity plummetted.
Gorbachev has supplemented
his proposals for changing -Soviet

 

social and political structures
with renewed calls for the elimi-
nation of intermediate-range
nuclear missiles in Europe. Only
this time, he has not made the
dismantling of these weapons
contingent upon the president's
willingness to abandon SDI. On
the surface, Gorbachev’s plan
seems noble, genuine and reflec-
tive of a marked change in Soviet
foreign policy. But look a little
deeper. Gobachev knows the
United States will never scrap its
Pershing missiles. Many in the
United States fought long and
hard to see them deployed. These
missiles are more than’weapons!
They are symbols of the Ameri-
can defense commitment to
Western Europe. They render the
defense of the United States and
its allies one and inseparable.

Aware of all this, Gorbachev
made his proposal anyway. He
realizes his calls for eliminating
the INF, coupled with his domes-
tic ”reforms” will make the USSR
appear as a benevolent, inward-
looking power. He knows further
that, the more pacifistic the USSR
seems to the U.S. public, the
harder itwill be for the president
to insist upon a firm defense
posture under SDI and upon
funds to thwart Soviet aggression
in Central America or anywhere
else.

Dealt a raw deal byPress

This letter is in reference to the

I article in The Pittsburgh Press on

Sunday, February-I5, 1987, en-
titled ”Youth Shall Be Served.”

The afternoon of Friday, Febru-
ary 13, a reporter from The Pitts-
burgh Press called the SGB —'
who called my friend —— who
talked to me and asked if I would
accompany her to a few bars. I
agreed. [...] I was told a reporter
from The Pittsburgh Press want-
ed to interview some underage
drinkers.

We met Mr. Roddy and
proceeded to the bars. [...]

Mr. Roddy told me [that] he
was moonlighting for asmall ar-
ticle that would appear in the
Leisure section of The Press. But
the article appeared on the front

LETTERS

page, top half of the Sunday Pitts-

burgh Press, not in the Leisure

section as_he told me!
Although I did not notice it Fri-

day evening, Mr. Roddy must

have had severe difficulties with
his pen. He seems to have writ-
ten an amazing number of mis-
quotes and inferences. The most
serious misquote was: ” 
Charles Miller  who hosted a
party in McCormick Hall Thurs-
day night.” I hosted no party

Thursday night in -McCormick-

Hall, nor.did I have ”a'case of
beer and a bottle of Black

Velvet.”
Mr. Roddy’s pen also assumed
and inferred many other things.

_ ”Bott|es are shuffled past beneath

coats. A keg ban be taken upstairs
in a box reading ‘television.’ ”
Not once did I mention either of
those things, nor did I state that
”cases go past the front desk in
gym bags.”

It seems to me [that] Mr. Roddy
took great liberties with the arti-
cle and with me. [...] Also, by
mentioning specific people and
places, he either knowingly or
unknowingly created a lot of un-
necessary grief to those men-
tioned.

Love, security and pressure are
tightly tied together in the aver-
age family.

It used to be simple. As a kid,
I would wake up around 7 a.m.,
eat a couple bowls of Froot
Loops, watch a little Bugs Bunny
and catch thebus to school. My
biggest worry at that time was if
I was going to get a fast enough
time in the 50-yard dash to make
the annual Junior Olympics.
Coming home from school meant
more cartoons, an afternoon
baseball game and watching The
Six Million Dollar Man before my

9 p.m. bedtime. The future only

meant summer cam

It was Thanksgiving Day din-
ner, I was in junior high school,
when my parents popped the
question: ”Marc, what do you
want to grow up to be?”

My grandparents, aunts, uncles
and cousins were at the table si-
lent and waiting for my reply.
What the hell did I know, I was
young and honest. ”A detective,”
I said. I

My grandmother turned white.
My parents gasped but were a lit-
tle more understanding. They as-
sumed I would grow out of this

silly idea.

In my family, the primary ac-
ceptable profession was medi-
cine. I had yet to learn that. I must
admit, my grandmother did try to
be flexible in her thinking. She

"used to always say I could be

anything I wanted to be as long
I was a doctor first.

As I grew older, my parents
subtly brainwashed me. My
father, a physician, frequently
brought me to the hospital with
him. It was a lot of fun. His pa-
tients were grateful, respectful
and kind. The nurses were friend-
ly, likeable and beautiful. Medi-

cine became quite appealing.

Eventually, I weakened. The
next time I saw my grandmother
I told her I was considering be-
coming a doctor. Her face lit up
with a wide grin, she sighed in
delight and gave me a loving hug.
It was so nice'to see her happy
from what I said that everytime
she visited_l told her the same
thing. ’

Years passed, and my first year V

of college was devoted to
chemistry and biology. This
made my family very happy. I,
however, was miserable and
confused.

College is for the exposure of
choices. Confusion was a natur-
al response. Limiting myself to
one choice made me miserable.
I soon realized that I didn't want
to be a doctor. I know my family
wanted the best for me, they just
didn't understand what that was.

Perhaps I don't, but it was my‘

responsibility to find out, not
theirs.

The best isn't as clear as it
seems. Once I told them my feel-
ings, I think they felt more com-
fortable with my future. Why
shouldn’t they? I wasn't a kid
anymore.

Be yourself for yourself, 
’cause no one else cares

”I wish I had never been
born.” _ , _ _ ,

At this point‘, an angel is sup-
posed to appear and tell you if
you were never born, a‘|ot of
people would be a lot worse off.

Unfortunately, this isn't a won-
derful life, and no angel appears.

In fact, the. cruel truth is,
whether you live or die, it doesn't
matter to anyone but yourself.
Sure, there will be people upset
for a while, but life goes on. So
why in the hell did you do it in
the first place? Because you were
looking for a permanent solution
to a temporary problem.

Teens who contemplate sui-
cide cannot possibly compre-
hend the finality of the act.

Four teens asphyxiated them-
selves in a suicide pact. Days

» later, two teen-age girls did the

same. Did the first act influence
the second? It was reported on
CNN network news that it is be-
lieved increased media attention
to suicide influences copy—cat
suicides.

There is no doubt in my mind
that the first suicides influenced
the "second.

However, if a person is suici— '

dal, anything could influence him
or her. A person who is suicidal
is just waiting for the last straw.

I saw someone attempting sui-
cide when I was just in elemen-
tary.school. I lived in Dunbar, a
once-booming coal town — there
existed the remains of bank, a
movie theater, and there was
even a -book written about it and
some neighboring towns —
Cloud By Day. There was none
of that left when I was growing
up. It was just a place for people
to live.

I was walking home from
school with my mother,— yes, an
old schoolhouse with a big bell

towerand everything — when we ‘

passed what used to be a popu-

ﬁat hotel. .

1
._ _._¢;

   

 

, ,.’-. ,__y A. V
I I I ., ’x

As we passed, my mother's
pace quickened, she grasped my
head and jerked it the other way.
It was too late, it only took a few
seconds to see what was going on
in the archway of that old hotel
and to remember it to this day.

A young girl, with blond greasy
hair and a gaunt frame was try-
ing to kill herself. I

She stood there, nothing but a \

humble body, clutching a kitch-
en knife so tightly the veins in her
arm were like thick rope. It
looked as if every vessel in her
body were about to explode. Her
face was swollen from crying, her
harrowing screams echoing off
the high ceiling of the archway,
only reverberating what she kept
repeating, until the sounds were
almost unbearable.

”Nobody loves me. Nobody
cares. Nobody loves me. Nobody
cares. Nobody love me. Nobody
cares.”

She said she was going to cut
herself to pieces.

I warn this will sound gory, but
as a child of about 7, I actually
imagined her body in tiny pieces,

like shattered flesh-colored glass, '

and I imagined how someone

would have to sweep her up, just

like dust. Just like garbage.
When I got home, I sat on the

front porch, in full view of the

' town, even the schoolhouse that

I mentioned earlier. I listened as
firetruck and ambulance sirens
roared throughout the town, the
town that would still be the same,

‘ even if this young women died.

It seemed so pointless.

Many people are driven to sui-~

cide because they feel their lives

are less thanperfect. That is the

most feeble excuse in the world.

I suppose they feel that achiev-
ing perfection is the only absolu-
tion for their faults.

However, in perfection, we are
proven fallible. Perfection of one
kind can only be achieved
through the sacrifice of another.
However, the sacrifice of a per-
fect human life makes no sense
at all.

She attempted suicide and pos-

- sibly succeeded. But the world

was all the same for it. One must
always wonder what someone
who has committed suicide
might have been. Fpr them, it is
too late to wonder. To bewhat
you are for yourself is all that mat-
ters, andlyou cannot do that if
you are dead. The only person
you can make a difference to is
yourself.

I will never know her name. I
will never know if she lived.’And
despite that, I "will always
wonder. .

It's happening all over I
the country: Little chil-
dren are carrying busi-
ness cards around.

No one is quite sure
when it began, but tod-
dlers as young as 3 years
old are being given bus-
iness cards (or calling
cards,-if you will) by their
parents. '

The cards look a little . \ ,

‘ different than the busi-

ness cards that adults car-  
ry. Grown-up businessmen  
and businesswomen usually have simple cards with little
embellishment: just their names, companies, addresses and
phone numbers.

  

 

The cards that children carry are more likely to feature‘
drawings of hearts, flowers, dinosaurs, balloons or clowns. '

Some of the cards are in the shape of pigs or elephants.
The child’s'name is printed on the card, but not his or
her-address or phone number. V
”I feel silly buying them,” one mother said. ”But all of
the other kids have them. The main way they are used
is as birthday gifts — it's easier to tapea business card
to the gift than to buy a regular birthday card.” _
Another mothersaid, ”It does make you wonder if we're
forcing our kids to grow up too-fast. The children have

started exchanging business cards, just like the adults do .

downtown.”

One of the largest suppliers of children's business-cards
is a company called Frances Meyer Inc., in Savannah, Ga.‘
Frances Meyer, owner of the company, said that the item

has become a ”really big business. We print the cards half I

a million at a time.”

Meyer said, ”It’s really crazy, but the kids and their par-
ents love them. We provide the basic decorated cards to
stationary-stores. Then the mothers come in and order

them personalized. They purchase them in sets of _25, 50'

or 100. We sell the cards with little boxes that fold flat
or with clear vinyl pouches with ribbons.” I

Asked why she thought children would possibly want I

to carry business cards, Meyer said, ”Maybe it's just a sign

1 of the times. Children want to be like young entrpreneurs;”

A mai|—order gift catalogue company called the Paragon,_
based in Westerly, R.I., features the business cards for chil-
dren in its mailings. Cindy Serra of the Paragon said, ”The_
great American work ethic seems to be getting younger.

‘Maybe these kids will grow up to be president of IBM.

But a 4-year-old with his own business card does seem A

awefully young.”

In Chicago, Nancy Gross, owner of the Watermark sta- if

tionary store, said that demand for the children's business
cards is heavy.

”We sell a lot of them,” Gross said. ”It’s not the chil-
dren who buy them, of course. It's the parents-and the
grandparents. The adults seem to have a real desire for
the boy and girls to have the cards.”

And in Lake Forest, |ll., Helander’s stationary storeg

reports a similarly large call for kiddee business cards.
”The parents come in and ask for them,” said Lynn Con-
nell of Helander’s. ”They don't seem to think that there's
anything funny about it. They just say they want the'chi|-
dren’s calling cards, and we know what they're talking
about.” - -

In Winnetka, III., in L&A Stationers, children often pick I ‘A

the cards themselves. ,

”The kids like to look at what we have avaialable,” said
an L&A manager. ”I’ve had boys and girls as young as
3 or 4 years old examining our samples and making their

' choice. They usually pick the ones with the brightest colors
or prettiest balloons.” . 4 L

A recent trend, the manager said, was for adults to buy
business cards as gifts for new babies.

”That way,” she said, ”the child will have a supply of
business cards from the time he or she is born. Obvious-
ly, a baby can't use business cards right away, but it's nice
to have them there for when he or she gets a few years
older.” .

‘She said that when the business cards are delivered, the
children are excited to look at them. .

”The boys and girls are very pleased to see their own
names printed on the cards,” she said. ”Even if they aren't
old enough to read their own names.” '

The festival, designed to resem-
ble a Latin feria, the cultural
equivalent to the American farm-
er’s market, offered ethnic foods
from such countries as Brazil,_
Jamaica and Argentina.

Typical foods such as Mexican
tacos and burritos were available,
while the more adventuresome
could try some less well known
dishes like empanadas or dulce
de batata (a- dessert imported
from Argentina made from sweet
potatoes). A

Colorful display booths
presented a variety of arts and
crafts that reflected the cultural
heritage of the Latin American
countries. Hand—crafted jewelry,
dolls from Peru and onyx crafts
from Argentina were some exam-

manship.

‘Throughout the day, perfor-
mances of traditional music and
dance -were presented on the
main stage. Included in the per-
formances‘ were a Caribbean steel
drum band and a limbo dance, a
Latin jazz quintet and Venezue-
lan dances. Petrash said that most
of the performers were Pitt stu-
dents, not professionals. '

Face painting and balloons
were available for the entertain-
ment, along with traditional La-

tin American children's games V

and hand-made pinatas.
Petrash said that the festival
was an example of the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh's growing in-
volvement with foreign cultures
and that it ”received the emotion-
al support of everyone in the
university.” '

College campuses see upsurge 
of bigotry and intolerance  

By Lee Mitgang

Associated Press Writer

America's colleges, where
tolerance is as essential to the
pursuit of knowledgeas labs and
libraries are, are being shocked
by a wave of intolerance and
bigotry.

The upsurge this year in inci-

—dents against blacks, women,

Jews, homosexuals and others
has spawned some harsh self-
appraisal by higher education
officials. 1

Many campuses feel their racial
climate is healthy. The Universi-
ty of Utah, for example, elected
its first female black student presi-
dent this year.

But campus administrators are
beginning to concede that they
have often been slow to react to
incidents, or too quickto pass
them off as isolated or insig-
nificant.

’’I don't think there's been a
great deal of leadership on the
part of university presidents,”
said Reginald Wilson, head of the
office of minority concerns of the
American Council on Education,
higher education's c-hief
Washington lobby.

The Anti-Defamation League of
B’nai B’rith found in its ”1986
Audit of Anti-Semitic lncidents”
that vandalism directed at Jews
on campuses rose from 12 inci-
dents in 1985 to 19 in 1986.

While few other overall statis-
tics exist, many observers agree
that bigotry is increasing on the
nation's campuses. Some believe
the problems on campus reflect

what is happening outside.

’’It seems to me that the mood
of the country, as orchestrated in
Washington, D.C., has said to a
lot of people that all the things we
were once concerned about in

 

 

terms of promoting equal oppor-
tunity don’t matter any more,”
said Barry Beckham, author of the
Black Student's Guide To Col-
Ieges, and an English professor at
Brown University.
The_administration denies that
it has backed down on a commit-
ment to civil rights, with Assistant
Attorney General William Brad-
ford Reynolds saying last month:
”We have had for the last six
years the most active and energet-
ic law enforcement program in

the field of civil rights in our '

history.”

Several widely publicized inci-
dents brought the issue of cam-
pus racism to the fore.

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —- Most girls
who drop out of high school do
so for the same reasons as boys
and not because they are preg-
nant, an education group report-
ed Sunday. I

The National Association of
State "Boards of Education said
pregnancy is usually thought of as
the main reason girls leave school
without a diploma. _

But its review of research
studies found that only 40 per-
cent of the female dropouts quit
school because theywere preg-

nant or getting married.

”When people think ofwho is
most likely to drop out, they think
first of disruptive boys and then

of pregnant girls. This stereotype
does not reflect reality,” the
report said.

”In fact, girls and boys drop out
of school at approximately the
same rate,” it said. ”The majori-
ty of girls who drop out are not
[pregnant].  Sixty percent drop
out for . reasons unrelated to
pregnancy.”

The study said factors leading
girls to drop out are the same as
those that cause boys to leave
school. ”Because girls tend to be
less assertive and less involved in
serious disruptive behavior, their
academic difficulties are often ig-
nored,” it said.

The report also suggests that
girlspay a higher price for drop-
ping out than boys. ”Half of all
families headed by a female

dropout live in poverty,” it "said.

In a separate study ondropouts
released Sunday, the Institute for
Educational Leadership called for
efforts to identify potential
dropouts at an early age and to
develop collaborative programs
with businesses to keep young-
sters in school or provide alterna-
tive instruction.

Currently, only 71 percent of
those who enter public high
schools wind up graduating, ac-
cording to Department of Educa-
tion figures. That figure does not
take into account those who get
high school equivalency
diplomas. _

The institute report, ”Dropouts
in America: Enough Is Known for
Action,” criticizes the lack of
uniformity in keeping dropout

statistics. ”It sometimes seems no
two [school districts] count

dropouts in the same way,” it

said. .
Students who flunk a grade and
are held back are ”up to four

times more likely to drop out.  - 1 I

Students hate being ‘too old’ for
the class,” the report said. i

» Forty-one percent of dropouts .

surveyed in Los. Angeles V in

1981-84 cited '”overage" as a rea- V 1

son for leaving school. .
”If there is a bottom line in the
dropout literature, it is that with

early detection more students»
could have been helped," the

study said.

It recommended that schools -

inform parents before suspending

or expelling problem students, in- »
‘stead of after the fact.

In The Complete Book of the

- Olympics compiled by David

Wallechinsky, Woodruff is
described as ”a 21-year-old
University of Pittsburgh fresh-
man who came from a poor
black family in Connellsville,
 Woodruff executed one
of the most unusual tactics
ever seen in the Olympics. _
Finding himself boxed in after
300 meters, Woodruff slowed
down to the pace of a brisk
walk and let all the other run-
ners pass him. Then he moved
way to the outside and sprint-
ed past his opponents. ...”
Woodruff told me that he
has been retired since 1978,
after years as ‘a social worker.

”I worked mostly with disad-
vantaged people. I ended up’
in the Job Corps program, a
program designed to educate
youngsters and give those who
have been unable to finish
high school an opportunity to
earn a high school graduation
equivalency,” said Woodruff,
who earned a bachelor's
degree in sociology from Pitt
and went on to earn a master's
degree at New York
University.

’’I enjoy helping people. I
wanted to help the disadvan-
taged,” said Woodruff.

And so he has. Woodruff has

proved that sometimes, by tak-
ing a step backwards, you can
only get ahead.

Proposedloan cuts would
affect over 8,000 Pitt students

By Teresa Candori
News Editor

Proposed changes in the
Guaranteed Student Loan pro-
gram will affect over 8,000 Pitt
students if approved, according
to the Pitt's Governmental Rela-
tions Committee.

Last year 7,376 undergraduates
and approximately 1,000 gradu-
ate students borrowed about $24
million in GSLs.

President Reagan's proposed
cuts in the education budget for
fiscal year 1987 include changes

in the interest rates for GSLs, an .

elimination of the subsidies on-
the interest paid by the federal
government while a student is in
school, and an increase in the

origination fee paid by the stu-

dent borrower.

The interest 'on GSLs are cur-
rently based on a fixed rate,
usually about 5.5 percent, ac-
cording to the Governmental Re-
lations Committee. The Reagan

By Jeff Barker

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Republican
Senators John Heinz and Arlen
Specter are in a prolonged battle
with the Reagan admini_stration
over its failure to approve the
Pennsylvanians’ choices for fed-
eral judgeships.

There are currently three feder-

-al court vacancies for the

Western District of Pennsylvania,
and three more for the Eastern
District of the state. Each day the
spots remain empty adds to the
senators’ frustration, Specter said.

”Of all the considerations,
what worries me the most is the
slowness of their [the administra-
tion’s] response,” Specter said.
”There is a real logjam because
of the slowness.”

The vacancies that have gener-
ated the harshest words between
the senators and the Justice
Department are on the
Pittsburgh—based court.

Thirteen months ago, Heinz
and Specter submitted the names
of three men to fill those spots —
Allegheny County Court Judges
James R. McGregor and William
Standish and Indiana County at-
torney Joseph Mack. A screening
panel recommended those
judges to the senators.

None of the three selections
has been formally approved by
the Justice Department. Heinz
and Specter have been told the
department is unhappy with
McGregor and Mack, but is like-
ly to move forward soon on’
Standish.

EZZZEPE7

Administration proposes to base
the interest on GSLs on the
government's Treasury Bills, plus
three percent. Current interest on
Treasury Bills is between seven
and eight percent, which would
make the interest on GSLs 10 to
11 percent, twice the current rate.

Interest on GSLs is now subsi-
dized by the federal government;
while a student is attending
school, thego_vernment pays the
interest on the loan. The Reagan
administration‘ also plans to
eliminate the subsidies.

The GSL program allows a stu-
dent to borrow up to $2,500 a
year during undergraduate study
and up to $5,000 a year for
graduate study. Repayment of the
loan under the present system
usually takes between seven and
10 years.

President Reagan's plan for the
GSL program would increase the
origination fee for the loans from
five percent to eight percent. Un-

It is against department policy
to comment on the cases of in-
dividual judge nominees, spokes-
woman Amy Brown said.
Privately, the Pennsylvania sena-
tors have learned the department
believes McGregor maybe too
much of a judicial activist and
Mack, 61, may be too old, among
other considerations.

According to Heinz, the depart-
ment tried to document its con-
tention that McGregor has too
often deviated from legal prece-
dent. Heinz claimed its study was
faulty.

”I had some lawyers in Pitts-
burgh take that document,
research it, and it turned out that

 the Justice Department's con— -

clusions were not only wrong in
their legal work but full of serious
flaws and very incomplete, very
haphazard,” Heinz said. His
aides said the‘ study was con—
fidential and could not be
released.

Some legal observers have said
the dispute may have ideological
roots. -

”Some observers have specu-
lated to me that this is an attempt
to ‘punish’ our senators for fail-
ing to vote with the administra-
tion on certain issues,” Chief
Western District Judge Maurice
Cohill said in an Oct. 7 letter to
President Reagan.

While Cohill said he did not
believe that was true, he added
that ’’unfortunately, however,
there is no question that some 4
million citizens living in the
Western District of Pennsylvania
are being punished in the sense

“ma reoc/< w'20¢c-rznrrorv or El/£EYTHINC "

der the present sytem, a student
borrowing $10,000 over a four
year period, would pay $500 in
origination fees. Under Reagan's
plan, the student borrowing
$10,000 would pay $900 in
origination fees.

In a memo from the Govern-

mental Relations Committee, ’

Chairperson Jeff Thompson and
Subcommittee Chairperson Curt
Toll called Reagan's proposals
”an extension of the govern-
ment’s reluctance to actively sup-
port postsecondary education.”

According to the memo, lobby-
ing reports indicate that Congress
is likely to make "substantial
changes in the aid proposals.

The Governmental Relations
Committee and the Student
Government Board are sponsor-
ing a letter-writing campaign to
protest the proposals. Additional-
ly, free literature will be distribut-
ed in the William Pitt Union on
the day of the campaign.

Judge void causesjam in courts

that they have a U.S. district court
which is 30 percent understaffed
at the judicial |evel.”

Peter J.vWallison, the presi-

dent's counsel, replied Nov. 17
that Reagan was ”keenly aware”

of the vacancies and was still try-
ing to find ’’suitable’’ candidates.

A member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, Specter last
year opposed Reagan administra-
tion judicial nominees from-
Alabama and Illinois. He said his
decisions were based on the
nominees’ competence, not their
political leanings.

”We cannot tolerate that in our
system, having judges picked on
i_deo|ogical bases,” Specter said.

The delays by the Reagan ad-
ministration in acting on the se-
nators’ selections has left the
candidates in limbo.

Asked in a telephone interview
about his status, Mack replied:
’’I’m not sure I know.” He said
that as far as he knew, he had
neither beenaccepted nor reject-
ed by the Reagan administration.

”I’m basically a busy country
|awyer_|iving in Indiana [Pa.] and
.I just don't have access to the
rumor mill,” Mack said.

Another significant element of
the dispute involves the number
of choices submitted by Heinz
and Specter for each vacancy.
While the senators said it was
traditional to submit just one
name, the Justice Department
said it wanted three names per
opening to give the president
more leeway.

‘THE PITT NEWS

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — The
bad habit of shooting poorly at
the foul line caught up with
Pittsburgh on Sunday, as the
No. 12 Panthers missed 15
fouls shots, and were defeated

' in the NCAA West Regional
96-93 by Oklahoma.

Senior Charles Smith, junior
Jerome Lane and freshman
Rod Brookin each missed four
foul shots.

Pitt hit only 44 percent of its
free throws, 39 percent in the
second half. Panther coach
Paul Evans said that may have‘
been the difference.

”You’ve got to make free
throws in tournament time,”
Pitt coach Paul Evans said.
”You can't win shooting 50
‘percent from the Iine.”

For the Sooners, meanwhile,
it was a season of playing
close games that finally paid
off.

”I think our team has been
in more late, critical game_sit-
uations than anyone in the na-
tion,” said Oklahoma coach
Billy Tubbs. ”We struggled
late in the season, but it's start-

" ing to pay off now."-’*-~  - 

Oklahoma needed to draw
deep from its well of ex-
perience as Pitt came back
from a 16-point deficit to take
a three-point lead latein the
game. Pitt missed two late
3-point attempts that could
have tied the score. » '

’’I wasn't worried when they

”They made a tremendous

could still pull it out.”

”McCalister lit it up in the
second half,” Evans said.

Pitt trailed 51-41 at the half,
but Brookin led a second half

Lane's basket and free throw

shows just how ‘far the Friars have

come under second-year coach 3

Rick Pitino. Billy ”The_ Kid”
Donovan was superb in wins
over Alabama-Birmingham and
Austin Peay. -

If Providence had a solid big
man, say a Charles Smith or Rony
Seikaly, then it would be a legiti-
mate Final Four contender. But
with Jacek Duda in the pivot, the

v Friars are a longshot in their game

against Alabama in Louisville
Thursday.
0 Last year they beat Pitt in the

"NIT, and everyone snickered at

the Panthers because of it. This
year in the NCAAs they beat
Clemson and took Kansas to the
wire yesterday before losing.

Yes, Southwest Missouri State
has a basketball team. Their nick-
name is the Bears, and they play
the game quite well.

Bruce feels Lady Panthers’ futre is bright  

l S - By Matt O'Hara

Staff Writer

Prior to the start ofthe 1986-87

' basketball season, Pitt's women

basketball coach, Kirk Bruce, was
anxious "to make a statement to
the teams in the Big East that

 V . when you play Pitt, you'd better
be ready to play.'’.

Unfortunately, the 7-21 (1-16
in the conference) Lady Panthers
instilled little fear in Big East op-
ponents, beating only eighth-
place (of nine teams) Seton Hall
once, while losing to them twice.

The ‘team suffered the same
problems from game to game.

-The Lady Panthers could stay

‘close for the first half, but allowed
unanswered scoring streaks in the

‘ later stages of the game that

usually made the difference in the
final score. _

Another one of the team's
major shortcomings was the ina-
bility to hold on to the ball. On
the season Pitt totaled 625 turn-
overs, while its opponents had
only 532. '

Regardless of this year's disap-
pointing record, the season did
end on an up note. ’'l was very

_ encouraged by the last six or

seven games,” said Bruce.
"No matter how you start at sea-

66 V  

We can't say any-
thing more than that
we are very close to

signing two outstand-

ing junior . college
players.
— Kirk Bruce

son or what happens during it,

you've got to finish as strong as
you can," he added. ''I really

think that it will lead to some- ,

thing better next year.”
This, he believes, is mainly be-
cause of the returning and incom-

ing personnel that he will have to .

work with next year — and he
definitely plans to work.
"We’ve got to work extra hard.
This off—season and next year's
pre—season will be used to get
these girls in tremendous shape,”
Bruce said. "The key to our train-
ing is that no one can neglect
anything. When I get them back
this summer, they're all going to
be hurting a little bit. September

is going to be the hardest month,

of their lives as far as their work-

outs are concerned."

Bruce and assistant coaches-
John LeMieux and Kim Basick are
currently "very excited” about
the prospect of signing two high-
ly recruited junior college
transfers.

"We can't say anything more
than that we are very close to
signing two outstanding junior
college players," Bruce stated.
"On April 8 [National Letter-of-
intent Day], when we get them
on the dotted line, we can tell
you all about them.”

Before this season started, the
Lady Panthers signed two stand-
out high school seniors, Penn
Hill's 6-4 center Connie Hurt and
5-10 Whitney Mack of Shawnee
High School in Springfield, Ohio.

With the prospects of Hurt,
Mack and the two junior college
transfers coming to Pitt, along
with returning starters Sally
Sheerer (this year's leading scorer
and rebounder) and Jen Shingler
(A||—Big East freshman,first team),
there are good reasons for the op-
timism. '

"Next year we're going to play
the way I want my teams to play
— and that's a pressing, running
style. We'll have the girls out
there that can do that," Bruce
said.

suffocating defense. And, believe
me, that will happen.

0 Looking for candidates for
All-America at the guard posi-
tions for next season? Make sure
you take a look at Michigan's
Gary Grant.

Grant is a great ball-handler,

passer and scorer. You won't find
too many players in the country
with his kind of scoring ability
that looks to pass before shooting.
Grant does. 1'

I haven't seen a better guard in
the country and that includes In-
diana’s Steve Alford and North
Carolina's Kenny Smith, who
Grant outplayed on Saturday.

(AP) — Cleveland State's ”run-
and-stun” reputation is about to
be tested by Illinois State as the
National Invitation Tournament
begins its second round. I

The reputation is all Illinois
State coach Bob Donewald
knows about the Vikings.

”I know they are a good tran-

I sition team and [Ken] McFadden

is a really good player,” said
Donewald, whose team travels to
Cleveland on Monday for a
second-round NIT game against
Cleveland State. ”But we don't
know" much more than that. We
are aware of their style, and that

will have a significant influence.” 9

Bobby Knight at Indiana, is in his
ninth year at Illinois State.

This year, his team beat South-
west Missouri State, Wisconsin-
Green Bay and I|linois—Chicago,
all members of Cleveland State's
conference. But Donewald
knows that Cleveland State's style
— full-court pressure on defense
and constant running on offense
—- differs from the other AMCU
teams.

”With the exception of DePaul,
Purdue and Indiana, this game
will be our biggest challenge,”
Donewald said.

Illinois State is led by Derrick
Sanders, a 6-6 forward averaging
15 points a game. Jeff Harris, a
6-4 junior guard, averaged 13.3
points and has made 93 of 184
3-point attempts.

McFadden, a 6-1 guard, leads
the Vikings in scoring.

Lumberjacks are No. 1 in the na-
tion, averaging 51.9 percent in
completing 3-point shots.

”We don't force the 3-pointer,
but we'll take it if we have it. That
is why our. percentage is so
good,” said Lumberjacks coach
Harry Miller.

Miller said the Lumberjacks got
the last of the 32 bids to the NIT,
and the players had to be called
in from the golf course and the
tennis courts when he found out
about the invitation.

”Our guys had already cleaned
out their |ockers,” Miller said.
”They thought all the NIT bids
had gone out. We didn't find out
until Monday afternoon that we
were in.”

The invitation came after Louis-
ville turned down a bid.

”As you might expect, our guys
are pretty excited  They know
they just got in [the tournament],
and I think they want to stay
around for a while.”

Among a crowd of about 5,000
spectators at State College, Pa.,

‘ this weekend, the Pitt men's gym-

nastics team took on the Penn
State Nittany Lions.
Unfortunately, the crowd
helped Penn State more than it
did Pitt, as the 9-5 Panthers fell
to the Lions 284.95 to 252.35.
Once again injuries played a big
part in the Panthers’ defeat. Fresh-
man Brock Freehling missed the
meet because of a possible frac-
tured rib sufferedearlier in the

As a result, the Panthers only
sent four men to the high bar.
Commented Pitt head coach
Frank D’Amico,”lt’s a different at-
mosphere, competing in front of
that many people. Our lack of
depth really showed. I thought
we were scored fairly, but I
thought Penn State was over-
scored. But I'm still satisfied with
our year. With all of our injuries,
were having a good year.”

The top all-around individual
for Pitt was freshman Pat Pollaci

who scored a 52.65, while fresh-

man Jorge Gonzalez was second

with 52.5. Pollaci stated, ”Our
whole team did good. We scored

pretty well without Brock. Per-

sonally, I’ve been hitting all of my
routines better than I was in the
beginning of the season, so my
scores are going up.”

The top Panthers on the floor
exercise were Steve Powanda
who scored a 9.1, Pollaci who
scored a 9.05 and Marty Comini
and Gonzalez who bothlscored
a 8.85. Junior Rob Albrecht filled
in for Freehling on the floor.

On the pommel horse, senior
Mike Mealie was first for Pitt and
scored a 9.2, while Pollaci was
second‘ and Gonzalez third. V

lane, and its start is_at the actual
starting line. The outside group is
on an outer lane and placed a

‘certain distance in front of the

starting line so that after one lap
the distances for each will be the
same. This gives runners time to
go into their own pace and avoid
being bunched together.
However, in Friday's race, the

distance between the boxes was '

not correct.
”The outside box staggered 10

' meters from where it should have

been,” said Manes.

Because of the error, all the
teams were invited to re—run the
event on Saturday. Since Pitt had
a poor showing Friday because of
the inaccurate distance, they
were placed in the medium-
speed heat instead of the fastest
and, in turn didn’t have any good
competition.

But in any case, the Panthers
proved victorious in that specific
heat.

In it, the team broke the all-
time‘ American record, which
also means a new school record

ma City crowd did give the Pan-
thers encouragement in their
performance.

”They were cheering for us.
People knew what happened,
and they wanted us to win,” said
men's track coach John Vasvary.
”A lot of people said it [Pitt's sit-
uation] was unfair.”

Minutes later however, the
faster heat teams ran and three
broke the record just set by Pitt.

Arkansas finished first followed

by Indiana and Big-East nemesis
Georgetown.
‘ Arkansas became owners of the
collegiate and NCAA record, but
the American record went to
runner—up Indiana because Ar-
kansas had a foreign runner. To
hold the American record, all
four runners of any relay must be
American.

”The times were real close.
They [Arkansas, Indiana, and Ge-

orgetown] were pushing each
other, and we ran by our-
seIves,”said Vasvary.

Pitt may have lost the American
record, but they did hold it for a
short time and that short time is
something that can never be
taken away from them.

”Ten minutes, or 10 years, it
doesn't matter,” said Vasvary.
”You set the record, and they list
the record holders in order so
we'll be listed.’’ ,

Junior track star Lee McRae
fared much better individually
than his teammates, winning the
55-meter dash in 6.14. It was his
second straight year in winning
the event — last year he set the
world record in the event with a
6.00. '

Sophomore hurdler Eric Can-
non had problems in his race,
tripping over the first hurdle. That
cost him not only the race but

John Vasvary

also a chance at repeating his All-
Americanstatus. But McRae and
the two-mile relay team of Wein-
er, Daniels, Manes and Moore

did capture All-American honors,

duplicating last year’sfeat.

With the help of these perfor-
mances, Pitt came out of the meet
with sixth place. In other words,
Pitt is ranked sixth in the_country
for indoor track. Last season the
team was ranked fifth in the
country.

NFL games to be televised on

ESPN cable beginning

By Dave Goldberg
AP Football Writer I

KAANAPALI, Hawaii — For the
first time in the 25 years since
their game became a weekly
event on national television, NFL

‘ owners heard the details Sunday

of a contract that puts the league
on cable TV.

It also does "not provide them
less money than their previous
deal with the three major
networks.

Commissioner Pete Rozelle
finalized on Saturday a new con-
-tract that is expected to bring the
NFL about $1.4 billion over the
next three years. That is about 3.3
percent less per year than they
got" this year from the $2.1 bil-
lion_, 5-year agreement that ex-
pired Feb. 1, although it is not
less than'the average amount
over the life of the old contract.

It will also make the NFL the

» lastmajor league to go to cable,

which, ironically, is one of the
reasons it is getting less money.
Cable television _and other

. aspects of the video revolution

have dispersed the advertising

dollar and caused the networks to
lose what they estimate to be $75
million on the NFL over the last
two years.

The contract gives ESPN, the
sports cable network, eight Sun-
day night games over the second
half of the regular season, the first
time the NFL has ever televised
games on anything other than the
regular over-the-air outlets. The
cable network also will televise
nationally four exhibition games
and the postseason "Pro Bowl.

Under the provisions of the ca-
ble contract, however, the ESPN
game will be shown on regular,
non—cable television in the home
cities of the teams involved. For
example, if Philadelphia were at
Washington on ESPN, the game
would also be shown in those ci-
ties — which are largely without
cable —— on regular channels
there.

The Super Bowl, however, re-
mains on network televisions —
ABC, NBC and CBS will carry the
league's championship game in
that order over the three-year life
of the contract.

The slight decrease in fees was .

nextfaH

not unexpected.

Over the last two years, adver-
tisers have been unwilling to pay
the networks enough to make up

for the high cost of NFL games ’

because of what they see as a dis-
persal of the market. That is, the
proliferation of cable and VCRS
gives viewers far more choices
than they used to have, cutting
the audience for network tele-
vision.

Despite the expectation,

however, the new contract is still

a bit of a culture shock for the
owners, who for the first time
since 1962 will not be receiving
a geometric increase in fees. The
$2.1 billion in 1982 was almost
four times larger than the one
signed in 1978.

The television contract also is
expected to have an effect on the
upcoming negotiations with the
NFL Players Association, in
which the union is seeking a form
of free agency similar to baseball.

7 The lack of additional funds may

be used by the owners as an ad-
ditional reason to stand firm
against any such system. '

Baltimore's Robinson says talent  

isn't enough to achieve greatness

By Gordon Beard

AP Sports Writer

MIAMI —- There may be no
substitute for talent, but for Frank
Robinson talent was not enough.

”You have to be able to add to
it  to never be satisfied,” said
Robinson, whose own quest for
excellence led him to the Base-
ball Hall of Fame.

”To be as good as you can be,
you've got to be willing to pay
the price,” the coach of the Bal-
timore Orioles said in an inter-
view following a spring training
practice at Miami Stadium.

”Most players are willing to
only go as far as the ability they
have,” he said, ”and are not will-
ing to go beyond. A good player
strives to be the best and is never
satisfied. ‘

”The guy I like isthe one who.

-:1 goes 4-for-4, and then .gets upset

when you get him out. That's the
guy who will be successful and
have consistent years.”

But there are too many players,
Robinson said, who go 2-for-4
and then become satisfied.

Even if a player has super ta-
lent, Robinson said, he still won't
.reach the heights within his reach
unless he concentrates.

”Guys like Wade Boggs and
Don Mattingly hit .310 or more
because they concentrate on ev-
ery pitch  every at-bat  every
second, and don't let outside
things take away from what
they're doing/’~

‘Robinson also used Boggs as I

an example of going one step
beyond. ..

”When he came up, he wasn't
that good a fielder,” Robinson
said. ”But he worked hard to
overcome thatwhen he didn't

have to. His bat would have kept

him in the majorrleagues.

_It was. time to
r uniform.”- —.

”The saddest thing in sports,”
he said, ”is to have all the ability
in the world but not put it to use.

-When. a player with lesser ability

gives all he has, he's more valu-
able to a club than one with more

-talent who is not producing as

well as he should.”

Looking back on a spectacular
career which ended in 1976 and
included 586 home runs, 1,812
RBI and 2,943 hits, Robinson said
he would have liked to have
been more successful. But he in-
sisted he always gave it his best.

”Numbers aren't that important
when you're playing,” he said.
”But ifl had known so much fuss
[was] being made now over why
I didn't get 600 homers or 3,000
hits, maybe I would have given
it a‘ shot. _ ’

THE. PITT NEWS, Monday, March 16,.’ 1987

Stepnoski ready for spring football ol

By Eric Reuscher
For The Pitt News

The spikes and pads have been
packed away in storage for two
months now at the Universityof
Pittsburgh. The football players
are not in the spotlight. Now the
basketball team‘ fills the head-
lines. During the winter months,
the players have the chance to
heal their wounds and prepare
for the upcoming season. Pitt
offensive guard Mark Stepnoski is
doing exactly that. -

Coming off an impressive
sophomore year, this native of
Erie, Pa. has earned quite a list of
post—season honors. He was
named to the sophomore All-
America and first team All-East by
Associated Press, and was listed
a notch below an All-America by
The Sporting News. For his work
in the classroom, he was named
to the GTE Al|—America second
team selected by‘ the College
Sports Information Directors of
America. Now Stepnoski is
preparing himself to achieve even
greater heights this coming
season.

”Lifting weights is the most im-
portant aspect of football,” Step-
noski said. ”Without the strength
and endurance you gain from lift-
ing, your whole career could be
spent on the sideline due to nag-
ging injuries.”

Pitt strength coach Buddy Mor-
ris likes Stepnoski’s attitude
toward weight lifting.

’’Simply put, Mark Stepnoski is
a winner,” Morris said. ”He is
very dedicated towards lifting
and never misses a session. He is
a very strong kid and could pos-
sibly be one of the strongest
offensive linemen in the country.
He bench presses well over 450
pounds_,and should be at the 500

mark by his senior year.”

Stepnoski would then follow
the tradition of Pitt lineman
Walter Johnson, who became the
first Panther to bench press more
than 500 pounds last season.

”There is a lot of tradition here
at Pitt especially on the offensive
line,” Morris said. ”There were
the Bill Fralics, thelimbo Coverts
and the Jim Sweeneys. These are
big shoes to fill, and Mark is
headed in the direction of play-
ing at the same level or even a
notch higher than these former
Pitt greats.”

Being compared to Fralic and
Covert could put pressure on an
athlete trying to fit the mold they
left behind. This is not true in
Stepnoski’s case. -

”I just try and play to the best
of my ability,” Stepnoski said..
”There’s no pressure on me at all, 0
they were my friends, and while
they were here, I learned alot
from them.

Along with making the grade
on the football field, Stepnoski
has proven himself in the class-
room. He has an overall grade
point average of above 3.2 on a
scale.of 4.0. This communica-
tions major is currently carrying
12 credits this semester with
classes in history, psychology,
communications and black rela-
tions. His favorite course is
history.

Away from the weight room
and classroom, Stepnoski likes to

_ relax by listening to music from

the late '60s and early '70s. He
also enjoys watching TV and V
playing pool, and on occasion
likes to read a good book.

”The_ one goal I have set as a
team goal for this upcoming year
is for us to have a winning sea-
son and go to a bowl game,”
Stepnoski said. ”For my personal

‘ Junior Mark Stepnoski should challenge or All-Aerica honors next fall.

goal, all I want to do is play ev-
ery game well and stay away
from injuries.”

If Stepnoski can stay away from
injury, it is almost certain he will
no longer be an almost All-
America, but an All-America
guard for the University of
Pittsburgh.

Spring football is scheduled to
open March 21 and will con-
clude with the Annual Blue-Gold
game on April 25 at Pitt Stadium.

KISSIMMEE, Fla. —' Neither the
Cy Young jinxnor a hectic off-
season of banquets can turn
Houston Astros pitcher Mike
Scott from his 1987 resolve.

He would like to make his two-
year reign as oneof the most

dominating pitchers in baseball a-

long-running performance.
Scott, 18-10 last season, led the
majors with 306 strikeouts and a
2.22 ERA. His no-hitter Septem-
' ber 25 became the first ever to

' same season.

His brilliance helped the Los
Angeles Dodgers win the World
Series.

The pudgy Mexican left-
hander, then 20 and with a very
limited knowledge of English,
was besieged for interviews.

Through an interpreter, Valen-
zuela said all the right things.
There was no controversy, no hot
quotes. Just a guy doing his job.

Now 26, Valenzuela is an es-
tablished star. While he has a

- pretty good command of English

and the baby fat of his rookie.sea—
son has long since disappeared,
he remains somewhat shy and

clinch a pennant.

Scott spent the winter being
adored as the National League Cy
Young winner and listening to the
stories about how some pitchers
flopped the year after winning the
award.

But the laid-back Californian is
taking- it all in stride.

”I certainly hope there's noth-
ing to it,” Scott said. ”I don't in-
tend to sit around and worry
about it. I'm just going about
spring training like always.”

Scott is off to one of his better

" starts.

He has pitched six innings in
two games against Los Angeles,

and the Dodgers have not scored’

any runs and have managed only
a single by Ken Landreaux.

Scott remains unimpressed
with himself.

still says all the right things.

”I try to do the best I can in
every game,” Valenzuela said at
the Dodgers’ spring training facil-
ity. ’’I’d like, to win more games
every year I pitch if I can.”

Has he changed since 1981?

’’I think so,” he said. ”I have
more experience, I have more
responsibility.”

Jaime Jarrin, who has broadcast
Dodger games in Spanish for 28
years, served as Va|enzue|a’s in-
terpreter in his early years. They
are good friends.

”I think he's changed for the
better,” Jarrin said. ”Despite his
millions," he's not flashy. He's

A   ...while Astros’ Scott wantsto

’’I could go out the next time

and get blasted,” he said. ”I’m
definitely not ready to pitch in the
regular season. I definitely wasn't
overpowering.”
. Scott's performances have
been uplifting to Astros fans, but
Scott keeps an even keel. He
didn't get upset at the disruption
of his vacation.

”You have obligations to do
certain things just by being a
player,” Scott said. ”But the off-
season was about 100 percent
more than I usually do. Most of
the things I did, I enjoyed.”

Scott's quick start this spring is
the opposite of what he ex-
perienced last year prior to his
outstanding season.

Scott still was struggling near
the end of spring training.

”I was getting near the end of

more open now, he's got a fami-
ly, and he takes that responsibili-
ty very seriously.

”He is still the same quiet per-
son. I think that's his personality.
He amazes me not only as a
pitcher but as a person. He had
just turned 21 when he got mar-
ried, and now he has three chil-
dren. He sets a great example on
the ballclub, never being late,
never missing a turn, getting
along beautifully with all his
teammates.

”And he keeps a heavy sched-
ule on his community involve-
ment, visiting schools, talking to
students.” .

improve

.spring, and [I was] a little con-

cerned,” Scott said. ”But I'm try-
ing to rush it more this spring.
Hopefully, I'll get through the
dead—a_rm period soon and get the
strength back for the season.”

Scott pitched three scoreless
and hitless innings against the
Dodgers last Thursday.

”|’m pushing it earlier and go-
ing harder than I have in the
past,” Scott said. ”That doesn't
mean I'm ready to pitch the regu-
lar season.” ’

Scott traditionally startsslowly
in spring training. Lastlseason, he
struggled throughout the spring
and lost his first two regular-
season decisions. '

”I could go out the next’ time
and have a little more pop and
give up some hits, but I'd be hap-
pier,” Scott said. D

Valenzuela has already won 99
games in the majors. He became
a 20-game winner for the first
time last year, compiling a 21-11
record with a 3.14 earned run
average and a league—leading 20
complete games. All that with a
fifth-place team that was 73-89.

. One thing Valenzuela wants to
change this year is the number of
pitches he throws.

_”I’m not a power pitcher,” he
said. ”I try to throw to spots. I
take the count to 2-2, 3-2 all the
time. I'd like to throw fewer
pitches. If I don't throw as many
pitches, I'll be stronger at the end
of the season.”
