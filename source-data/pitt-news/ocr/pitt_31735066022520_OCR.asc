New ‘Van-call’ service

may begin by W€€k.,€;I1(le..,p.

By Megan Bertino
News Editor

The Student Government Board
hopes to have the new “van-call”
shuttle service working by
Saturday.

According to SGB President
Brent Saunders, the SGB is
working to get the shuttle running
this weekend, but the service
may not begin until Monday.

The shuttle will run seven days
a week from 9 p.m. to 2:50 a.m.
The vans will be equipped with
cellular phones so students can
phone the driver at 491-/iVAN.

SGB is hoping to get two
shuttles with the capacity for a
least eight passengers, according
to Saunders. The vans will cover
the same radius as the current
Yellow Cab free Pitt Taxi service,
he said. A

The proposed radius is “a pretty

good size,” but Saunders added T

thatSGBwillbewillingtoexpand
the scope if students feel it is

necessary.

Funding for the new service
has not yet been established.

Saunders said he is hoping that
the department of public safety
will cover the costs, but if not, the
money will have to come from
the Student Activities Fund until
another solution can be reached.

SGB is currently trying to locate
existing university vehicles for
the service because it would be
too expensive to lease vans.

Saunders stressed that the
service is only for necessity trips.
Although no one will be turned
away, he hopes the shuttle will
not be abused.

“Ifyou abuse the shuttle, you're
taking it away from someone
who might need it,” he said.

Saunders reminded students
that Yellow Cab’s free Pitt Taxi
will be in service until Dec. 14.

After this term SGB will not be
renewing its contract with Yellow
Cab because of student
dissatisfaction with the service.

Soviet economic recovery painful, Reagan appointee says

By Larry Choug
Staff Writer .

Although the rest of the country has
breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the
Cold War and the Gulf war, the former
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff sees
a monumental task facing U.S. strategic
decision-makers.

Admiral William]. CroweJr., who served
two terms as the chair of the joint Chiefs
of Staff under Reagan from 1985 to 1989,
addressed an audience last night at the
Frick Fine Arts auditorium.

Dealing with the Soviet Union and the

tensions in the Middle East will be
“protractive and painful,” he said. “When
the Chinese say that we live in interesting
times, I think that they had this time in
mind.” .

According to Crowe, the Soviet Union
has undergone a fundamental
transformation toward a “freedom of
expression to move about and to think,”
coupled with “the two revolutions against
74 years of communism and Russian
imperialism.”

This newfound freedom undermined
the coup by Soviet bureaucrats “who
missed the change,” he said.

He also sees a dramatic reshaping in the

sees the solution as a lengthy and painfully

Soviet Communist Party, the KGB and the
military, which he envisions as “taking
quite some time to sort things out.”

The United States will be faced with
multiple centers of decision-making as the
individual republics progress toward
autonomy, he said.

But Crowe said the economic depression
in the Soviet Union is the main problem
facing the Soviet Union and its relations
with the United States.

This problem is so serious that “the
whole free world could not muster the
resources” to save the Soviet economy. He

drawn-out process. .
Concerning the Middle East, Crowe
admitted that it would be “difficult [for
him] to assess the situation with a detached
eye” because of the success in the Gulf
war as well as his own military background.
But the commitment to the region doesn't
end just because the United States won the
war, he said. “The purpose of wars are not
just to defeat opposing forces. They must
have some political end.”
These political ends are improving the
plight of the Kurds and decreasing nuclear

Crawford implored students
to “become who God created
you,” and said it is important
to know your own culture in
order to communicate with
others.

University of Pittsburgh
Professor Barbara Sizemore
said black students have no
excuse for not knowing about
their own culture because of
resources like the black studies

- department and the Afro-
American collection in Hillman
Library.

But

knowledge, students wrongly .

“We must be strong in our

cultures doesn’t make you

any less black,” Crawford
said.

When students asked her
where to turn for help,
Crawford said students must
turn to black alumni. ,

They will become the main
contributors in the completion
of a cultural center, she
said.

Currently, Pitt’s search for a
cultural center is in the initial
stages, according to BAS
Deputy Chairperson Justin

Mister Rogers archives housed in university library

By Julie Sabol

For The Pill News

Fred Rogers, the man who
taught many of us how to get to
the land of make—believe, has
played a part in almost everyone’s
childhood. People in Pittsburgh
have the opportunity to find out
even more about him at the official
“Mister Rogers” archives, located
in the Library and Information
Science building at Pitt.

The Fred Rogers Archives,
which contains videotapes,
scripts, books, puppets and many
other artifacts from “Mister Rogers’
Neighborhood,” is open to
everyone. I

The collection wasstarted when
Rogers “was made an adjunct
professor to honor his work with
children. He gave us the
videotapes representing the
history "of his program. It’s really
to honor him and his effective
communication with children,”
said Dr. Margaret Kimmel, the
chair of the library science
department. —

All of the programs from “Mister
Rogers’ Neighborhood” are kept
in the archives and can be
watched right there in the library.

“It’s best if you know which
programs you want to see and
call ahead of time so it’s set up
and ready to go for you,” said
Perry Reeker, the special
collections assistant and director
of the Elizabeth Nesbitt Room,

which houses the archives.

If you have a particular episode
in mind but don’t know the name
or episode number, you can still
find it.

According to Reeker, ifyou can
remember three things about the
episode, such as the special
guest, a song that was sung or
what the topic of the day was,
you can find that episode with
PittCat.

The library also has a set of the
puppets used on the show, which
are now on loan to the Children’s
Museum of Pittsburgh.

Rogers started in television in
the 19505. All half—hour shows of
“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood”
have been taped here in
Pittsburgh. Locally, the program
has run since 1966, originally in
black in white, and nationally in
color since 1968. This includes
an amazing 775 episodes.

Before starting “Mister Rogers’
Neighborhood,”- Rogers was on
“Children’s Corner” with Josie
Carey, also a children’s program.
Now, Fred Rogers makes 15 new
shows per year, which are done
in three one—week series, each
having their own theme.

His newest series is premiering
next week, focusing on how
people can be creative with
art. ’

This week’s focus is.on work,
and for all those interested, today’s
show is on fixing things and
working for good changes.

“Everything that happens on
the television program comes
through [Rogers’l own creative
work,” said Hedda Sharapan,
associate producer of “Mister
Rogers’ Neighborhood.”

Rogers writes the scripts and
music, including the lyrics and
melodies for each program, as
well as doing the voices for many
of the puppet characters,
including those of King Friday
XIII, Queen Sara, Corny, X the
Owl, Henrietta Pussycat, Lady
Elaine Fairchild, Daniel the Tiger,
Donkey Hodie and Grand Pere.
All of the puppet names are

entered in PittCat.

To make a search, enter the
puppet name like an author
search: X the owl has 45 entries,
while Queen Saturday (Sara
Saturday) has 178 entries.

“It’s professionally gratifying to
know that the School of
Information Science recognizes
that ‘Mister Rogers’ Neigh-
borhood’ is a resource that needs
to be preserved as an archive,”
Sharapan said.

“This is not just ‘another one of
those kiddie shows.’ It is deeply
rooted in child development
theory, dealing with the major

tasks of childhood, such as
separation and return,
aggression and fears,” she
said. I .

‘‘It’s also exciting to think this
rich library of over 600
videotapes, books, cassettes and
writings is available to students
now.”

“Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood”
can be _seen on Channel 13,
Monday through Friday at both
10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

“In person [Rogers] is just like
he is on TV. It's what everyone
says, and it’s true. He’s very, very
personable,” Recker said.

Toxic threats

Waste Technology Industries, the company that wants
to build a toxic-waste incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio,
is under attack by Frank LaGrotta, a Lawrence County
legislator.

The incinerator will burn approximately 9,400 pounds
of lead and 2,650 pounds of mercury per year. These
elements are detrimental not only to the environment but
to humans and animals within an extensive radius of East
Liverpool.

Actor Martin Sheen was arrested last month while
protesting the incinerator behind the gates of the
construction site.

Reports from the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for
Hazardous Materials Research claim that the emissions
from the future incinerator are “safe.”

Lead, mercury and other dioxins should not be considered
safe.

Although it seems that the construction of such an
incinerator should not be legal, W’l‘l has found precise
loopholes in the legal system and has carefully woven its
way through them. According to state law, such a facility
can not be built if it is within 2,000 miles ofa school. The
nearest educational facility from the already contaminated
site is 1,100 miles. In addition, the nearest residents live
close to 900 yards from the site.

WTI snaked its way around this law in 1979, when it
purchased its siting permit from the state of Ohio. Ohio’s
environmental laws were not revised until 1984, and WTI
is thereby permitted to follow the original dictates of its
lease.

This type of technicality is similar to a criminal being let
out of jail because his Miranda rights were not properly
read. Pathetically, WTI does not feel that its incinerator
will cause any harm. N , j
’ Medical research proves that young children are very
receptive to immunity—depleting diseases. The children
who attend the school nearest WTI’s future incinerator
could very well be harmed for life.

The incinerator will provide jobs for many of these
people, but financial stability is no reason to endanger the
lives of not only Ohio residents but Pittsburgh ones as
well: East Liverpool is less than 30 miles from us.

LaGrotta has asked Attorney General Ernie Preate to halt
operation of the facility, saying Preate is obligated to
protect Pennsylvania from hazardous-waste emissions.

Scheduled to begin burning waste materials in the
summer of ’92, W'l'l’s opponents just might beable to stop
the production of the plant. Pressure from outside forces

and proof that the incinerator is extremely haza'r'dous~

might force other ‘legislators' to take notice and j_oiri'inth'e

, ' ' protest. Hopefully the incinerator can be shut down even
’ ‘ 1 before it is opened. ' _ " , - A  ,, ,

Pitt campus saga never-ending

Lately I’ve had time to consider some things that
are going on here at Pitt, and I ’d like to share‘ these
considerations with you, the esteemed student
body.

oThis whole “politically correct” thing is really
bugging me. You might think that I’m talking about
the recent “Tomahawk Chop” scandal, but I'm not.
The issue that I ’m referring to is much more serious:
the shift in nomenclature from

a vigorous promotional campaign, including
“Bubby’s Mom” posters, buttons, bumper stickers
and banners. Talk show appearances would also
be helpful. Come on. Let’s get the Bubby’s Mom
ball rolling!

-Speaking of which, it seems that Pittsburgh is
the city of und'erachievers. With the exception of
the Penguins, professional organizations and our
own college teams seem to have
a way‘ of letting down the fans

When I first came to Pitt, the
operating term was “freshman.”
That is what we were called, and
that is what we called ourselves.
When someone at a party asked
what year I was, I said, “freshman,”
and then I did some fast talking so as not to be
categorized as the stereotypical idiot — quite a
character—building experience.

These days, though, the trend is to say “first-year
student,” a term with much less heart and less
character-building potential. 0

-What has happened to the Sparrow Lady? For
those of you who have not been acquainted with

  David  
Roman

they have.

_ C ’ Examples are the Steelers
(forobvious reasons), the Pirates
(whata waste of toilet paper), the

- Pitt football team (S and 0 until
they played a good team) and the Pitt basketball
team (last year’s Big East tournament was awfully
short for Pitt fans).

Don’t get me wrong. I’m an academic
underachiever-myself, so I’m not judging these
teams. I am relating to them. Let’s hear a big cheer
for Pittsburgh, City of Champions. .

oI’d like to compliment TCI Cable on having, a lot
of nerve. Those of you who live encarlnpus and

Staff‘ Writer

With Jason Bodnar missing a
national bid by one place, Mike
Formica missing it by three and a
young Panther team dropping
from last year’s third—place ﬁnish
in region two to this year’s eighth
place, it was a long ride home for
the men’s cross—country team this
past weekend.

The only solace for the team
seemed to be the radio blaring
the Rolling Stones’ “You Can't
Always Get What You Want.”

But as the song goes on: “You
can try sometimes / and you just
might find / you get what you
need."

Except for graduating seniors
Formica and Pete Beehler, Bodnar
and the rest ofthe Panther harriers
got just what they needed: plenty
of experience for the future and
a hard—earned base for the 1992

track season.

“I can’t be too disappointed,”
Bodnar said. “I still ran a good
race.”

Bodnar, who was 12th overall
in the IC/IA race and eighth in his
region, improved dramatically
over last year’s 6/ith-overall
placing and his 32nd regional
spot. I-lis time of 30:52 was his
best 10,000-meter performance
on a deceptively tough Lehigh
University course.

"1 thought that if everyone ran
great, we would be in Arizona,”
Bodnar said. “But everyone didn’t
run great.”

"Even though we didn’t make
nationals, this season wasn’t a
failure by any means,” said cross-
country head coach Jim Lear.
“Everybody worked hard and
had fun. I'd like to think that is
what college sports is all about.”

Following Bodnar was Mike
Formica in his last race as a Pitt

Panther. Despite a finishing drive
reminiscent of his winning kick at
Notre Dame this season, Formica’s
regional finish of 13th place in
31:05 fell short of his goal of
going to nationals.

‘‘I did the best I could do,”
Formica said. “I went to the well
and came up a bit short, but
winning isn't everything in this
sport. I ‘d like to think I’ve made
a contribution into the future of
this young team. Pitt will slowly
creep into the ranks of the national
level over the next couple years,
and I wish them luck.”

Following Bodnar and Formica
was first-year runner Frank Nesco
with his time of 32:13, good for
57th place. Mike Lynn, capping
off a banner season, finished four
seconds behind Nesco and
finished 63rd.

“Frank and Mike really came
along ‘this season,” Lear said.
“They had to make some training

adjustments, and both of them
developed really well.”

,Also covering the lush ﬁelds of
the Sacoun Valley was senior
Steve Forrester. His time of 32:39
earned him 80th place. V

“Steve did what he could do
this season,” Lear said. “He ran
great early on, but the team
needed him to run that way the
whole season. I think he just got
tired.” .

Craig Woshner came back this
season after a year layoff for one
reason: to contribute to the team.
He accomplished that with his
96th—place finish in 33:01.

“I would like to personally
thank Craig, along with Mike
[Formica] and Jason, for their
leadership,” Lear said. “Craig
coming back to the team said a
lot about his devotion to the
program. He set a great example
for the younger guys on the team.”

Brian McCollough, although not
running the best performance of
his life, gained some experience
for next season with his 33:15,
good for 107th place.

Perhaps the highlight of the
weekend was once again the
lady harriers. All but one set a
personal record on the undulating
course.

Laura O’Donnell was at her

best when it counted the most
this season. Her 17:26 took nearly
a half minute from her previous
best for 5,000 meters. O’Donnell’s
time earned the junior 28th place.

Junior Carmela Mariani backed
up O’Donnell’s performance with
a personal record of her own.
Mariani’s time of 17:30 pulled
down a 31st place in the region.

“Laura and Carm finished higher
than any other Pitt runner has at
this level,” Lear said. “They helped
pull the team from second to last
in the ECAC last year to this year’s
14th place. It’s been a great season
for both of them.”

Stacey Wyzykowski, despite
drinking a whole can of soda 15
minutes before the start of the
race, finished in 67th place with
a time of 18:24.

Jen Hrach rose to the occasion
with her fastest five-kilometer time
ever. Hrach’s 18:28 was good
enough for 70th place. Judy Facey
also contributed to the team’s
improvement with a personal
record of 19:05. Facey’s time led
her to 87th place.

“I think if we can recruit two
solid kids for next year, the
women’s team will be very good,”
Lear said.

“This team made a complete
360,” said women’s track head
coach Steve Lewis. “The problem
is that their 360 didn’t look like a
360 because of, the Villanovas
and the Providences they had to
run against. They have certainly
come a long way.”

nuclear build—up in Iraq.

According to Crowe, the
United States will be forced
to maintain cordial ties with
the oil— producing countries
because of the country’s
heavy reliance on crude oil
and a lengthy resolution to
the Palestinian problem.

And things will probably
get worse before they get’
better, he said.

“Freedom is not always
free,” he concluded.
“Sometimes it requires
sacrifice, and sometimes
even blood. Our forefathers
knew that well.”

As chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Crowe
served as the principal
military adviser to the
president, the secretary of
defense and the National
Security Council. He also
served as the commander
in chief of the U.S. Pacific
Command, the U.S. Naval
Forces and the allied forces
in southern Europe.

Crowe currently teaches
geopolitics at the University
ofOklahoma and serves as
the councillor at the Center
for Strategic and
International Studies? in
Washington, D.C.

Last night’s lecture was
sponsored by the Matthew
B. Ridgway Center for
International Studies at Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs.

There is no equal to the moviemaking tandem of Martin
Scorsese and Robert DeNiro, and .Cape Fear, their latest
collaboration, only serves to further solidify their rightful place
as cinematic deities.

Like many of their other projects, the film examines the
individual’s relationship with society and splashes in doses
of betrayal and helplessness to concoct a thrilling and
' horrifying blend of the American system gone awry.
In Cape Fear, it is the manipulation of the
criminal justice system that exploits and shields
both DeNiro’s_vengeful ex—con, Max Cady, and
his prey, the Bowden family (Nick Nolte, his wife,
Jessica Lange, and their 16-year-old daughter,
Juliette Lewis). ‘ V 
Cady emerges from prison after serving a I if
15-year sentence for the brutal rape of a A?
woman. Over time Cady has discovered. 
that his lawyer, Sam Bowden (Nolte), 3 ‘
suppressed evidence about the promiscuity ''
of his victim. Armed with this, Cady has
decided that Bowden is to “learn something
about loss.” ’ J

Cady’s vengeance begins with slight
harassment and turns quickly violent. -Cady
exacts punishment. on Bowden’ through his
friends as well as his family. The system turns

against Bowden as well, as he finds everything
he does to combat Cady is thrown legally and
~ ’ ' '_ ' , n » V emotionally ‘ ’ " 
back into his
face.
As Bow-
den’s des-
_ peration rises, so
does the pulse of the film,
leading to an eventual life-
and-death confrontation be-
tween Cady and the Bowdens.
Cady’s dilemmas are similar to
earlier themes in Scorsese’s work. Like
Travis Bickle in 7'axz' Driver and
7799 King 0fC'0medys Rupert
Pupkin, he is a soul who
' cannot contain himself .- _ _
as the situations around him unfold. What separates
these earlier characters from Cady is the emphasis on J
his “solution” rather than the events that lead to A

Metallica live.

The kings of thrash; the saviors
of metal.
" Lightening—fast guitar work. In

Tonight these metal gods will

I ‘be playing at the Civic Arena.

I Those of you lucky enough to

have tickets will be enjoying a

.4 i great show. Those of you without
' will be missing the concert of the
, — season and, quite possibly, the

concert of a lifetime.

These four metal gurus put on
a show like nobody else can.
Things are going to be a little
stranger than normal this time,
though. For those of you who
have not yet heard, Metallica will
perform the concert in the round.
The diamond-shaped stage will
extend from one end ofthe arena
to about the middle. In addition
to that, 75 lucky fans will get to sit
in the middle of the stage
surrounded by the band, in what
has been dubbed the “snake pit”
by people in the know.

This concert in the round is a
change for Metallica. I’m not sure

how it will perform in the round,
because that setting is usually

’more conducive to bands that

move around a lot, such as Def
Leppard.

Metallica is very stoic up on
stage, moving only when
absolutely necessary from what
I’ve seen in past performances.

One thing is certain to be the
same. Volume. Metallica’s
trademark loudness should be
heard at the arena tonight. Every
time I've heard these guys, I've
had trouble hearing for the next
couple of days. They pump up
the volume to the point that not

etal gods Metallica thrash Way into the city

only do you hear the music,
you feel the music. Metallica is
the only band that should be
allowed to play at that volume.

When Jason [Newsted, the
bassist, for those not in the
know] plays the bass or Lars
IUlrich, the drummer, for said
same people] hits the bass drum,
you really know it. You feel it
rumble in your stomach and
move throughout your entire
body. Metallica is not only audio
and visual; Metallica is physical.
It all adds to the great
performances.

It will prove interesting to
see how the band works the
new material in with the old.
The new material is a little
slower and not as hard as
previous efforts, but it is just as

good. Gone are the eight- and
nine-minute epics, such as

“Disposable Heroes” and “Master ‘

of Puppets.” They have been
replaced with shorter and more
melodic songs, such as “Unforgiven ”
and “Enter Sandman.”

Like I said, mixing the two will be

interesting, but if anybody can pull '

it off, it will be them.

Because of the success they have
had with the new album, people
have accused Metallica of selling
out. Metallica selling out and
compromising its music? Give me a
break. These are a few of the people
in the music industry who would
never sell out themselves. T hey’ve
struggled for over 10 years to gain
the recognition they now get. That
recognition has been deserved ever

Lench Mob leader back
droppini bombs on wax

Ice Cube
Death Certiﬁcate
Priority Records

The minute your eyes hit the
cover of Ice Cube’s brand-new
wax, you’ll realize that the Nigga
Ya Love To Hate ain’t takin’ any
prisoners this time. Cube is
droppin’ another bomb on us
with all the bluntness of an
aluminum bat across the grill.
Whether you love it or hate it, the
fact remains that hatred is the
canvas on which Ice Cube’s
artistry is painted.

The cover, with Cube looming
ominously over the dead corpse
of dear old Uncle Sam (draped in
the stars and stripes no less), tells
everything you need to know

. about Death Certificates themes.

Bitterness, resentment, anger and
depression envelop Cube’s face
in that unmistakable scowl that
only he has.
Death Certificate is Ice Cube’s

second solo release. Since 1990’s

platinum debut, Amerile/elea ’$M0$t
Wanted. Earlier this year he

dropped the seven-track EP, Kill
At Will. After the massive success
of his major motion picture debut
as Doughboy in BoyzN 7heHood,

Cube is poised to reach a wider
audience than ever. In the latest
Billboard LP chart, Ice Cube listed
second. Think about it. Second in
the states, behind country singer
Garth Brooks. What’s goin’ on
here? Ice Cube has notoriously
been rap’s angriest young man,
leaving everyone for dead in the
dust of his cyclone rage. So you're

asking, “Whats new?"

This record focuses that anger
in an entirely different light and
shows the full—circle maturity of
Cube, who has definitely changed
his outlook since the days of
1989 and Straight Outta
Compton. Since leaving i\’.W.A.,
Cube has emerged as a more
intense but undoubtedly more
“real” figure. The days of“8—Ball,”
“Dopeman” and “Gangsta
Gangsta” are long gone, but as
far as Cube is concerned, all the
better. I’m with him. His music
and his pull are stronger without
his old crew, and in reality, Ice
Cube was N.W.A. They ain’t worth
jack without him lyrically, and
their same old thing is gettin’
stale.

Now 22 and a new father, the
reflective (yes, reflective) Ice Cube
is changing, crediting much of it
to his newly found religion, the
Nation of Islam. But remember
this is still the Cube. Controversy
swirls at this very moment, as
Cube’s education of the young
reaches an extreme, with definite
racial overtones on this record.
Jewish communities have already
boycotted, and Billboard itself
encouraged retailers to protest
anti-Semitic, white and Korean
sentiments expressed in the lyrics.

The Boogie Men, Sir jinx and
Cube himself take the controls
on this one, givin’ it a funkaliscious
taste. The record’s two sides are
“the Death Side” and “the Life
Side.” The “Death” is Cube’s vision
of where his people are today,
while the “Life” is a mirror image

Fear

Continued from page 8-]
his actions.

Scorsese skillfully twists the
events of the 1962 original Cape
Fear. Instead of Sam Bowden
being the hapless victim of
circumstance, he must take
responsibility for Cady’s rage,
given his unethical behavior. As
well, the Bowdens are not the
slice-of—apple-pie family in the

original, as past infidelities by
Bowden have stretched his
marriage to the brink of collapse.

DeNiro is unreservedly sinister,
charging Max Cady as a warped
and twisted, pseudo-intellectual
good ol’ boy.

His perverse mannerisms play
second fiddle to the torment his
swaggering nonchalance evokes
on Bowden.

APOLLO;

Staggering character portrayals
typify Dei\’iro’s film career, and
Cady rivals Bickle as his most
unique creation. DeNiro flecks
his simmering brutality with a
sophomoric understanding of
man.

Even when he lets loose with
soliloquies of self-ri ghteous bible
passage and introductory
psychology, DeNiro keeps him

focused to his tasks at hand;
none more harrowing then when
he seduces the young Bowden in
her high-school basement.

Nick Nolte develops his
character admirably. He is the
confused father and husband who
wants things in his family to be
like they were before his infidelity,
and he cannot understand why,
when Cady threatens to tear them
apart, they’re unwilling to pull
together as one impenetrable unit.

Despite her inability to deal
with his infidelity or any sign ofa
repeat affair, Jessica Lange
provides the real strength for the
family. She is its real protector,
free from the machismo that
characterizes her husband’s
actions. She is the one ready to
sacrifice to keep harm from her
daughter.

An equally arresting per-
formance comes from Juliette
Lewis. As the film progresses, her
teetering sexuality develops from
a sign of vulnerability to a weapon
against Cady’s attacks. Her
innocence, coupled with the zest
for rebellion, allows for the real
uncertainty of the film. Her
potential for harm or resiliency
becomes the real driving force
behind the film.

Although Scorsese’s pace is
frantic, he never loses his grasp
on the film. In this, his first attempt
at a psychological-suspense genre
piece, Scorsese has proven he
can raise suspense to the point
where my escort to the film, as
well as about 15 others, huddled
in the lobby of the theater because
they couldn’t deal with this
cauldron of horrors anymore.

fashion, spreading mayhem
against Amerikkka:

“Goddamn, it’s a brand new
payback/ from the straight gangsta
mack/in straight gangsta black/
how many gotta pay/went to the
shelf and dusted off the A.K../
Caps gotta get peeled/cause the
nigga ya love to hate still can kill
at will.”

He lets us take notice that he
went platinum and didn’t come
close to selling out. Cube wreaks
havoc on his detractors as well as
R&B and new jack swing
pretenders, lettin’ y’all know that
the Lench Mob (now at least 17
members strong) is still the No. 1
crew in the area, while even
dissin’ the L.A. Raiders “‘cause Al
Davis never paid us.”

“My Summer Vacation” is funk-

 laden jam, as Cube and a few L-

e-n-c-h M-o-b gangbangers take
a trip to St. Louis and bring the
drive—by along to Mizzou. This
cut is stripped down with a deep
bass and constant sample of
George Clinton’s “Atomic Dog,”
complemented by a chorus of

backing vocals. This is the funkiest
track ever by a Compton brother.
Dope.

“Steady Mobbin”’ keeps the
nasty funk ﬂowin’, sliding into a
walking bassline and piano for a
laidback groove with a recurring
loop of “Here goes the
neighborhood” blended with a
slammin slice of The Average
White Band’s “Reach Out.” Cube
gives a tour of a day in the life of
the L.M. One of the ﬂy cuts is
“Givin’ Up The Nappy Dug Out,”
which grooves nice with a gospel-
style backing chorus. The Cube
lets an unsuspecting, naive father
know that his precious pride and
joy is a little ho. He advocates
safe sex on “Look Who’s Burnin’,”
harshly scolding the careless who
don’t. He warns of HIV over a
saxophone and horn loop from
Boogie Down Productions’ “My
Philosophy.”

The most ‘political jam is “A
Bird In The Hand,” which
interestingly enough begins with
the voice of Sesame Street’s Big
Bird and features DJ Chilly Chill

scratching over an orchestra. He
trashes the Bush administration
for not helping the
underprivileged. A high-school
dad can’t make enough to support
his boy working at Mickey D’s, so
he’s forced to sell cocaine instead.
“Gotta serve food that might
give you cancer/cause my son
doesn’t take no for an answer./
Now I pay taxes that they never
give me back/but what about
diapers, bottles and similak?”
We know what Ice Cube thinks

‘about gun control already, but

“Man’s Best Friend” for him is his
Smith&Wesson, true protection
from the violence he lives in —
not a dog. This track isn’t real
complex — just straight
knowledge without much ﬂavor
— but he’s comin’ correct on it.

The “Life” side is by far the

slammin’ side. “I Wanna Kill Sam”
is vintage Ice Cube, all the anger
crashing down like a tidal wave,
while he looks in Compton,
Oakland, Watts, Philly and
Brooklyn for Uncle Sam, who is
soon to be murdered. All that,
with more funky horns. “True To
The Game” slows down for the
reﬂective Cube to rip the crossover
sellouts to pieces without even
preachin’ or yellin’. Nice.

He still proudly lives in South
Central and scorches those who
move away, like N.W.A'., who get
theirs on

“Then I got that awful phone call.”

Inevitably, we knew the saga
would continue between the
Lench Mob and N.W.A.’s crew,
but Cube gets the best of ‘em
with a mortal response to their
“Message To Benedict Arnold.”
The tempo grooves quicker than
the rest of the record with nice
piano. Cube exposes Ren, Eazy-
E, Dre and Yella for what they
are: overexposed frauds. They
can yell all day, but they don’t
come close to Amerile/e/ea’s Most
Wanted. “Doing Dumb Shit”
details Cube’s childhood over an
uncharacteristically bright and
happy horn track.

I’ll be straight up. Death
Certificate didn’t hit me on the
level of Amen'Ielelea’5 Most, but
there are some slammin’ tracks
that must beheard regardless.
With 20 tracks in all, of course
there are some that don’t ﬂow.
“Alive On Arrival” just gets

S-5

monotonous, dragging on way
too long. “Horny Lil’ Devil” and
“Black Korea” have nothin’ to say
musically or lyrically with that
touchy racist tone. But the shining
glory of this man’s brilliance and
maturity is evident. Cube’s “hell
witch y’all” posture should have
alienated him from further
exposure or recognition in our
watered—down, commercial,
mass—marketed world by now.
But fortunately his word is born,
and I gotta tell ya: Ice Cube has
much knowledge worth listening
to, regardless of how you feel
about him.

Death Certificate will cement
Ice Cube as a growing voice in
American culture (much like
Chuck D., KRS-One or Ice-T) and
ensure his status as a hip-hop

legend. Whether you love or hate .

him, you just can't fade him.

performance in T7yeACCused. She
begins to feel threatened when
decidedly thorough child
psychologist Jane Grierson
(Dianne Wiest) descends upon
the T ates’ world to bring Fred to
her school for the gifted and take
him on her “Odyssey of the Mind”
national tour for gifted children.

Dede isn’t thrilled at first but
concedes when she realizes that
Fred is not “normal or happy,” as
\X/iest points out when Dede
explains that that’s all he wants to

Although Fred excels in the
orbit of the other gifted children
—— indeed, surpasses them — he
misses‘ his mother at crucial
moments, like when he _has a
nightmare, and \Wiest’s only
solution is to offer a drink of
water, even after he tells her he’s
not thirsty.

Hann-Byrd’s naturalness fits the
role perfectly. His lack of that
awful “Cosby Show”-like child
acting is reminiscent of Foster’s
own ease on the screen as a
child. Wiest is superb, and the
script, and Foster, never allow
her character to fall into the “bad
guy” role.

Touching moments abound:-

to the wind on the playground;
Dede says goodbye to’ her son
before he spends the summer
living with Dr. Grierson to take a
college course, and college
student Harry Connick Jr.
consoles the little man after
accidentally knocking him out.

The brief sequence with
Connick reminds us of the single-
parent theme and the roles that
Dede and Fred have played in
each other’s lives. He balances
her checkbook and writes her
resume, while she Cuddles him
after each nightmare. Dede has
so much to lose in the Grierson
conflict, but she does what she
believes is best for her son.

The ending is storybook perfect
(perhaps too much so), but it's
nice to see Wiest’s and Foster’s
characters teach each other
something about balancing the
dictates of the heart and the head.
Foster’s film is merely a glimpse
of the vast potential of this
woman, who appears to be one
of the next decade's most exciting
new talents. She’s taken notes
from Scorsese, Demme and
everyone in between, and I think
that if this is the newly-born
director, the toddler stage can
only fascinate as much.

Anything goes in Carnegie Mellon’s fantasy tale The King Stag

By Matthew Goldstein
Smﬂ‘ Writer

Once upon a time, there was a
grand magician, Durandarte, who
was turned into a parrot 

So begins the simple tale of The
King Stag, presented by the
Carnegie Mellon drama depart-
ment at the Kresge Theater.

To find out how to restore the

magician’s magic powers, we
venture into the kingdom of
Serendip, where King Deramo
searches the land for a new wife.
Candidates for the role of queen
are the ditzy Smeraldina, the prim
and proper Clarissa and the
reluctant Angela, who wins the
throne.

And that’s when we’re thrown
into the forest for the real

adventure, as the evil prime
minister, who is in love with
Angela, tries to kidnap her and
do away with the king.

Anything goes in this fun
production of The King Stag,
directed by Larry Arrick, whose
latest directing credit is Catskills
on Broadway, which will open
on Broadway on Dec. 5.

This 17th-century Italian play

For

you can
talk to

by Carlo Gozzi (translated by
Carl Widman) is a rarely if ever
performed play in the tradition of
commedia dell’arte, an extinct
play form which calls for
improvisation to string together
its loosely etched characters and

5-9

 

scenes.

Arrick, as well as the cast, takes
full advantage of this freedom,
most notably with the hilarious
song breaks woven into the
storyline to advance the plot.

The latest member of the
Native Tongue family, Dres
and Mista Lawnge, keep
the faith of the Tongue
posse with an album full of
sex, sex, sex. A Wolf In
5/.’)€6[)$ Clothing feels like
an overblown Ilollywood
production with sex, crazy
humor and some violence
that is not to be taken
seriously.

Drama, violence  you I
gotit. Check out “U Mean
I’m Not,” where Dres wakes

BLACK

   
 

all doin’ the nasty. Or the
females’ response on
“L.A.S.M.,” a mock
interview with the crew
that tells us why the word
“ho” is used so dominantly
on the LP.

“H0 is merely short for
honey; we just got lazy
and dropped the ney,”
explains Lawnge on a track
that should have Tipper
Gore and her conservative
cronies forgetting who 2
Live Crew is. Sexist is one
way to describe the wax,

but it’s reality. What young _

adults aren’t out lookin’ to

it: the Lawnge one, what’s up? black goes the hand
smack/ I get the feeling that it’s time for some Black
Sheep fun.” Which of course means knockin’ boots.

“I-lave U.N.E. Pull?” is slick, filled with clever organ,
trumpet and sax samples at different intervals, with Dres
boppin’ in and out ofa hype drum track. The new single,
“The Choice is Yours,” features an awesome drum beat
and some of the minimal scratching that Lawnge offers.
Both ofthese tracks have the unique Black Sheep chorus,
which is actually sung melodically rather than with a
sample that is prevalent in rap today. “You can get with
this or you can get with that. I think you’ll get with this
‘cause this is kinda fat.”

Fat like the crazy, swirling sample of Rare Earth on the
deep “Try Counting Sheep" or “Black with N.V.” another
deep bass groove with typewriter scratching.

Other outstanding highlights include the conceited
Dres daring us “Gimme Tha Finga” and the hype free—for—

get laid? Black Sheep just likes to do it in funky style. In
fact, it does it in many styles, with many different girls,
except the “Strobelite Honey.” Yo, Dres, explain this:

“When you see a honey by the strobelite/ Black, I hope
you got good sight/ for honey that you see, like the
Shakespeare so1iloquy,/ may or may not be  all that.”
But the record is  and more. I

As far as musicality, Black Sheep drops new beats and
samples with a little scratching that adds to a mellow,
unique, overall flair. While Mista Lawnge’s rapping is
kept to the sex tracks, Dres is all over the wax, ﬂowing
like mad with dope lyrics. Check the psychedelic loop
courtesy of what might be the first Jefferson Airplane
sample in rap (of “Today”).

“In the bathroom I go and fixing his fro/ you guessed

all of“Pass The 40,” with Lawnge, young Chia1j(“[he child
of the wild, flavor of the Nile”), JJ, Native Tongue legend
Chris L1ghtey,A&R man Dave Gossett and Dres all kickin’
massive lyrics:"‘Step into the booth, and give ‘em proof
that Black Sheep don’t need jack to get loose.”

’Yo, they dont need jack. It’s all natural, like Breyer’s
S cream. The vinyl includes two remixes, one of “The
Choice is Yours” with a new verse from Dres and “Have
U.N.E. Pull?” with all new lyrics courtesy of the Lawnge
one and Dres. Also check out “Hoes We Knows” and the
old-school, freestyle ﬂavor of “Blunted.” V

Black Sheep are slammin’ out tha box on their debut
wax. I urge y all to go wit this flow ‘cause like they say,
“Our dicks are the planet, and where are you?” G-g—'g-g-
ghossssssttttt!

up and goes on a Jim Morrison tear (like in “The End,”
where jimmy takes out his family). D-R—E-S beats his
sister, punches his mom in the chest and shoots her in the
head, kills his dad and the mailman all before catching the
schoolbus. The two—minute whirlwind is actually a cynical
look at “hardness,” with Dres waking from his dream,
saying, ‘‘I dreamed l was hard.” In a society filled with
mugs trying to be badder than the next, the Black Sheep
come from a different angle, although being hard has a
lot to do with it.

Not hard as in strapping a .9 mm, but hard as in erect.
The Black Sheep give new meaning to the quote, “I’m a
lover not a lighter.” You want a plot, you get it in spades,
hittin’ skins. Simple as that. So sample “La Menage,” with
Dres, the 9.5 sugar-dick daddy Mista Lawnge and Q-Tip

Ifyou’ve never seen them before,
you’ll-see something that will not
only knock your socksoff, it’ll
knock your underwear off as
well. Ifyou don't have tickets, go
down to the arena and try and
buy some off the people who’ll
be scalping them. Metallica is
well worth it. Metal militia, I’ll see
you there tonight.

instrumentation (saxophone,
cello, guitar, bass and drums)
and approach of Curlew with the
chaos and humor of Naked City.
It’s jazz, but not the kind you’re
used to hearing. Saxophonist Ben
Opie’s two songs, “Drill Press”
and “Power Strip,” show him to
be a top-notch composer as well
as player. The theme to “Drill
Press” effectively depicts the title
with a stop/start motive that
bounces between the sax and
cello and the rhythm section
before Opie lets out with a ripping
solo.

After the band plays free for a
minute or two, “Power Strip” kicks

are going to. . .
Well, they’ve

in with a. sideways funk riff that
also showcases guitarist Darryl
Fleming. -

Sandwiched between the two
songs is “Americar Sales and
Service.” Fleming takes on the
guise of what sounds like a white-
trash car salesman, while the band
makes noise behind him. As
you’re getting used to that, they
kick into something that can only
be described as some kind of
blues, with Fleming crooning over
it. Then it ends.

For my money Watershed is
the best band in Pittsburgh. These
three songs are great but by no
means enough.

Continued from page S-9

The cast lip-syncs to MichaelJackson’s “Beat It” and such ‘S03 1
tunes as “Teenager in Love” and “Hound Dog,” which Prime
Minister T artaglia lip-syncs to his daughter Clarissa for not 
winning the hand of the king.

Everyone in the cast lives up to the fine reputation of Carnegie
Mellon’s theater -department. Emily Skinner as Angela, Brent
Jefferson Lowe as Truffaldino and Kelly Bertrand as Clarissa are
particularly energetic and fun.

- Michael J. Fuller and Michael Lucas are the most active of the
cast as the “giant squawking bird” which interweaves the other
characters’ tales in the story and eventually restores the young
magician to his own self, ensuring that everyone lives  happily
ever enchanted.

The King Stag runs at the Kresge Theater at Carnegie Mellon
through Dec. 7.

It could only mean that IKEA is
kicking off their Holiday Season.

It’s inexplicable. .

It’s unbelievable. y

It’s IKEA at the Holidays.

Don’t miss what we’re not really

talking about.
