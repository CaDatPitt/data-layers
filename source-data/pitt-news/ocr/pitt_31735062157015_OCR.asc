Spitalny Orchestra
Plays for Heart Hop

There are four shopping days 1eft——not for Christmas-——but for
girls to grab themselves .a man for the “Heart Hop.” Set for next
Friday at the Schenley Ballroom, the “Heart Hop” will feature
the “turnabout” theme which means in plain language, the gal

foots the bills.

Jimmy Spitalny’s orchestra, fresh from a tour of eastern col-

lege dates, will provide the music.

The orchestra is a re-organization

of a’ group that played with Spi-9

talny before the war.

Jimmy represents the fourth
generation of the musical Spitalny
clan. His father, Maurice, is di-
rector of the KDKA orchestra.
His Uncle Phil leads the All Girl
Hour of Charm, and his Uncle Leo

is one of NBC’s music directors.
This will be Spitalny’s third
visit to Pitt. His first two were
the “Howdy Hop” in September,
and the “Prima Hula” dance of
ﬁve years age.

The  Wh1p Cracks
the School of Engineering and Mines is plan-
Jning a summer that is going to be a severe
C hardship for many of its students. Dean Hol-
brook has announced that once again it is
compulsory for his students to attend the sum-
mer semester or for-feit their standing in the
school. i I

Those dropping out must apply for read-
mission if they wish to return in the fall. The
letter says in part, “All undergraduate stu-
dents ‘now in school are expected to register.”
In the letter, though, is no solution to the
problem of . the student who wants to work
during the summer to keep himself in college.

With a high percentage of veterans enroll-
ed, the school is able to “crack the whip”
and be assured the classrooms will be ﬁlled
when summer comes. Non-veteran students who

   
  
 

desire to work. for their tuition or expense,

With the spring semester barely under way,‘

money are going to have to drop out or work 

at night.

Carrying the heavy schedule that is as-
signed on the hill is tough without holding a
job on the side. Somewhere along the line
something will give; will it be the student’s
sleep, his grades or his health‘!

VVhatever purpose is behind it, a compul-
sory summer semester is going to be a strain
on all but scholarship students ‘and rich men ’s
sons. Certainly the entire group of students
doesn’t fall into either of those two categories.

oiﬁcials. V »

V , Officers of the organization are meeting
,with members of the Activities Recognition
V Committee to receive the ﬁrst authorized an-
swer on their petition for official standing as

.a University activity. A

The old Independents association had been

' getting into full swing when the war broke out

and put a damper on its activities. Now it is
hoped that the new organization will be able
to take up where the old left off and go even

_; further.

Independent students need an organization
of this sort to provide them with social op-
portunities equal to those of fraternity and
sorority members. It’s their big social chance.

Up-to now all of the ,work has been done
by the ofﬁcers and council-—after Thursday’s

pendent to decide whether the new organiza-
tion will succeed in its aim of providing a
well—rounded University program for the in-
dependent students.

i Congress Prexyi
Rafes Orchids
For Industry

By Bill Veenis

Along about the end of this week, a much
overworked male senior member and president of
Student Congress will issue a report to the stu-
dent body.‘ ’

1 George M. (for Montague) Lynn has labored
over this report to the students for many weeks.

x

“Spook” was authorized to make it by Student‘

Congress when, toward the end of last semester, he
made the mistake of recommending to Congress
that it should tell the «world what progress has
been made to date, and what strgggle it has bad.
So, since Lynn made the suggestion, and
since no ‘student is anxious to work, Mr. Lynn
was 'una.nimously_c11‘osen to complete the re-
, port.
» It is hard to say what actual material will ap-

pear in the Congress statement, but you can be 4 '

sure nothing will be mentioned about the guy who
has made Congress tick since last May. The Mauch
Chunk, Pa., president of Congress is that kind of
modest guy. -
In my brief sojurn in that body, I came to
realize just how thorough a manager a. man
must be in order to get any kind of progress

   

   

from the student legislature. Lynn has been
the person to do that. V

“The mom, of’ life is past,

N And evening comes at last.”

_ Stephen Collins Foster. T

Evening has come at last to Josiah K. Lilly, patron
saint of Stephen Collins Foster. He died February 8,.‘
1948, in Indianapolis. And» with his passing, Pitt has lost
her most distinguished “oﬁ?-campus” alumnus. During‘
the past quarter century Mr. Lilly gave much of his time
and fortune to collecting Foster songs and making them
available to people throughout the World. His priceless
Foster Hall collection was given to the University of
Pittsburgh, together with “an endowment so that “Fos-
ter’s songs will go ringing down the ages, and the knowl-
edge of Foster will ever be growing fresher.” Dr. John
G. Bowman, President Emeritus of Pitt, reports that there
are some,10,000 items in this collection. This priceless
Foster Collection and Lilly Court are dedicated to his I
memory. ~
I was honored to be asked to represent the University

of Pittsburgh at his funeral. It was a private funeral———
perhaps two score people were present. Among them was
the Foster Hall Quartette———the ﬁnest Negro singers I’ve
ever heard. Somehow I had the feeling during the cere-
mony out here in his hill top country home that the
 whole world was at that moment, joining in the refrain——— 
': “Gone are the cares of life’s busy throng , . . 
J . . . Star light and dew drops are waiting for thee.”

3, campuses throughout the country. At the present time the committee

of deans here at Pitt is considering both student and faculty proposals
thataa greater degree of political activity be permitted on the campus.

We think that Pitt students are interested in learning what other
universities are doing about the situation. The item printed below
is ,from“ The Michigan Daily, student newspaper of the University of
Michigan. It oﬁers what, we believe, is a. plausible solution.

Several weeks ago students at our sisteneducational institution
up in East Lansing stole a march on us by gaining approval for
the formation of “political clubs.“

‘ Michigan State President Hannah okayed the move asking
only that‘ student political groups take it easy on state politics
whére appropriations to the college were involved. The action was
hailed by students who immediately took steps to organize young
Republican, young Democrat and Wallace Progressive clubs. A 'j

We checked with President Ruthven to see if something of this T I
kind might be done here. Mr. Ruthven, in a letter, said the adminis- .
tration ofﬁcers of the University had discussed the subject and turned
the matter over to Dean Erich Walter. , g I .

Dean Walter has been studying the subject of political clubs 
for some time. Recently he approved a request by the president of ~
the Ann Arbor Young Republican club to announce meetings on
University Bulletin Boards and include a sign-up sheet for any l
student interested in joining the club. V v

This latest action amounts to approval of political activity, 5
among students. Now all that remains to be done is for a group; ~»
of Wallace‘ backers, young Republicans or young Democra to;
apply to the Committee on Student Affairs for official sanction:  V

This is an election year when many students will=be casting}
their ﬁrst presidential vote. Nothing could be more natural than tlgief
formation of avowed political student groups to back one party of? . V.
the other in the coming campaign. These groups could secure topf-E 
ﬂight speakers for appearances here to explain issues and ask;
for support. .

In the past political . groups have functioned on campus , in’
one guise or another. However they have mostly been the voluble ,
far left ideologies, leaving the vast majority of students, who lean‘ "
toward established parties, without any voice.

There is of course one touch question which will undoubtedly V
come up if political groups are approved here. The Communist
party is recognized on the.,ba1lot and members of that group among the”
student body will ask for recognition. They should be recognized and?

even though the headline-hunting Detroit newspapers will hysteri-
cally cry “Reds Rampant» on U Campus.” _ p P V S
University authorities should not allow themselves to be sway-
ed by circulation-building‘ Detroit papers. It is generally recognized
that well-informed students can intelligently choose among con-
ﬁicting ideologies if they have the opportunity.‘ ‘

Outdoor guys and their feminine counterpafts
indulged their fondness for nature’s cooler side at
the Seven Spring Farm resort on a recent Week-
end with Pitt’s Ski Club, the ﬁrst of similar week-
ends on ' the group’s prospectus.

A young and dynamic organization, the Ski
Club meets. both in the Cathedral and on the West-
ern Pennsylvania slopes to consider a long-range
program~ including plans for a ski lodge somewhere
on Laurel Mountain, development of student ma-
terial for a Pitt ski team, and active ﬁnancial sup-
port for the National Ski Patrol System, a volun-
teer organization which patrols the trails of the
nation’s ski resorts.

Complete freedom to study com-

His . statement to the United

America’s foremost authority

Your doctor pounds your bent knee with his little
‘mallet and your foot is supposed to give a hefty kick.
Just-to prove you have nerves. And there are some who

say getting riproaring furious proves you have feelings. Your blood

courses through your veins, your

temperature soars, there’s color in

your face . ..you’re very much alive and kicking. When your feelings
are pinched, pricked or trod on...they react.
I’ll go along with that...and a bit farther. If you never. get mad ’
you’re a very placid cow. Nothing disturbs you...nothing ruﬂies you
...nothing makes you see red. Which is plenty dull. Getting a good
mad on does relieve the monotony.
You can let oli streams of steam. Splutter words that resound and
reverberate. You can ﬂail your arms, break dance records, throw
books, slam doors. You can blow your top!

If you’d just explode and get

it over with! But those brooding '

ires are something else again. They consume your good nature, gna

away at your good sportsmanship,

dark-cloud your fun...they last too

long. They turn into grudges and prompt you to spiteful tricks and

malicious remarks.

It’s more refreshing to volcano and forgive, But even that will
lose its eiiect if you seethe over every little thing. Your boyfriend
might have danced ,__more than you think necessary with that raven-
haired vixen. The girls might have left you out when they planned

that big weekend. Maybe the boys had something to offer your steady

Dozen Carnations Serve "A$  Reminders  

Oi-Kosciluszko. Forgotten Polish Hero-  

Last Thursday was Abraham
Lincoln's birthday and every-
where newspapers reviewed, his
life. ’

Today, _Lincoln has
been forgotten again, but
dents now remember a
whose story was left untold on
his birthday Feb. 12.

The name of Tadcusz Andrzej
Bonawentura Koscius7.l‘~:o is sy-
nonymous on the Polish calendar
with Feb. 12. But much oi’ the rest
of the world has seen only Lin-
coln’s face on the calendars that
day.

Why are students now remem-
bering the great Polish soldier
and statesman when they forgot
him on the holiday itself? The an-

Polish room, 126 C1, :1 buff col-
ored straw basket holds six white
Carnations. Interspersed w i t h
green shrub, the ﬂower arrange-
ment gives a patriotic effect with
its dominating red.

The man, Kosciuszko, Polish-
born Revolutionary War hero of
the United States, lived for his
country. Kosciuszko entered the

U. S. Army in 1776 and distin-
guished himself. He rose irom
Colonel to Washington’s adjutant,
then to brigadier general. Nat-
uralized in 1784, ne found him-

self going to Poland to free his

“own" people. The great leader
fell captive to Russia and was im-
prisoned until 1794.

The flowery tribute, seems ﬁt-
ting. The symbolism of freedom
and st.1‘eng,‘tli which is part oi‘ the

Locals. 38-28
The Educators’ clean 38-28 vic-
tory over the Locals establishes
this gridder-studded quintet as
the odds-on favorite to cop the
1948 intramural championship.

Both teams sported 3-O records
before the fray to lead the strong
Cosmopolitan League. The Educa-
tors added to their prestige be-
fore the semester break by thump-
ing last year’s champs, the PE
79’ers, 36-14. ,

Ralph Short, Lindy Lauro, and
Tony Lateano paced the Educa-
tors running attack. Although the
victors led at the half, 20-12, the
contest was close and hard-fought
all the way.

Mermen Capture Nine Events
In Sweeping Saturd

By Bob Van Atta. ~

  

a_y's Meet

Ben Grady’s temperance of the obvious superiority of the
Panther swimming team by withholding top men from several
events failed to prevent the undefeated Pitts from sweeping
every ﬁrst place as Edinboro fell, 59-16, at the YMHA pool
Saturday night before the largest home crowd of the campaign.

Three of the four seconds wone

by the visiting Red Raiders were
due directly to the absence of
Dick Petro, Paul Brugger and
Mike Levine from the 50, 220, and
440-yard free style events.

The most closely contested race
on the card was the 440, won by
Ed McKee in a rousing ﬁnish
after he had been last most of the
way.

Levine Rests

Just a nose behind, Holdren
edged Edinboro teammate Free-
land for second. It was nearly a
triple ﬁrst-place tie.

Art Arvanitis, who led most of
the way, ﬁnished last as a victim of
poor pacing. Both McKee and Ar-
vanitis are newcomers. Mike Le-
vine, regular 440 ace, was rested.

Levine managed to take his cus-
tomary ﬁrst, but in the 220yard
free style, where Paul Brugger
was rested.

Varsity Maces
Titans. 68‘-62.
Gets Cones

The Panthers had their ice
cream ration increased this week.
The reason is twofold. One is to
prepare them for Friday’s tussle
with West Virginia at the Sta-
elium. The second is a reward for
their 68-62 victory over West-
minster.

The surprising Caravan, who
have not yet to lose to a district
foe and who have won nine of
their last twelve, made it four
straight Saturday night.

So Doc Carlson is serving extra
ice cream with the hope that add-
ed vitamins will enable the Pitts
to extend their ﬁve game home
streak and, thereby climb above
the .500 mark.

. The Medieval spirit is recaptured in the pictorial essay,
entitled “The ‘Medieval World,” on exhibit in the Fine Arts
library, which began Feb. 12 and will continue through

The exhibit, made up of photographs reﬂecting the medie-
val spirit through the church, the town, and the castle, was
‘published in “Life” last April and May.

Twenty—four panels make up %
the . exhibit which contains pic-'
tures, drawing and captions ex- W
pressing the day-to-day life or,
the medieval man. . _

Church life is depicted in a se-
quence of panels featuring,cathe-
drals and abbeys. Color reproduc-
tions of stained glass from Bourges ‘
and Chartres highlight this sec-
'«tion of the‘ exhibit. ,
1 Photographs and captions of the’
Abby church at Vezelay explain
the fascinating story of how it be-
came a pilgrimage centgr. Back in
the middle ages relics of Magdalen «.
lwere placed there, drawing con-
tinuous crowds of pilgrims. The
"tradition was carried on through .
the ages.

”_'~_‘lé.e second division of the ex-
hibition treats town life in the late
Middle ‘Ages. Engravings of nar-
row, dirty streets, and sketches of
Nuremberg and Dinkelsbuhl de-
Ivelop the panels of medieval town
Ilife.

r ‘One of the more outstanding
pictures in this division is a repro- »
duction of the Canterbury Pil-
grims as seen by a Flemish mini-
aturist. Such famed characters as
the squire, the pioress, and the
iknight are plainly discernible.

A Feudal life, centered about the
Lord’s castle, is portrayed in the
third set of panels. With black
and white photographs of the
famed Muiderslot .castle in Hol- _'
land and‘ color reproductions of at
tapestry depicting a Unicorn Hunt,
the panels bring back the glory
and chivalry of Medieval days. J

Professor's Questions

Yie|dScIlairy Data

FEAST LANSING, Mich.--The range of salaries that students may
expect upon graduation if employed in business or industry was the
subject of a survey conducted by Dr. F. K. Hardy, of Michigan State
College’s Department of Business Administration.

Dr. Hardy sent out more than 1,500 questionnaires to large
and small ﬁrms of all types in an effort to determine the financial
outlook for business administration grad.uates.

Employer estimates of salaries¢

paid to employees hired directly
after graduation average $228 per
month. After working two years
the graduate can expect close to
$309 per month, and after ﬁve
years $396 per month. After ten
years of employment, the average
pay is $566 per month.

A further breakdown indicates
that the highest pay upon grad-
uation‘ goes to students hired in
real estate ﬁrms, industrial traf-
and industrial
personnel, in that order.

Pay Off in 10 Years

However, after ten years of em-
ployment, those positions receiv-
ing top pay immediately after
graduation are not in the running
for the highest paying positions.
They are retail marketing, market
research, V and selling, again in
descending order. \

The largest gain made by way
of position on the pay scale dur-
ing a ten year period is account-
ing, which moved from sixteenth
to sixth in salary standings.

. Employers, in listing what they
valued most in an employee. rat-
ed pleasing personality and ap-
pearance as the most important
Practical college
training rated next. and full tiifie
work experience without college.‘
training rated third. Better than
average grades was considered
next in importance, and. part-
time work while in college fol-
lowed closely.
Liberal Arts Low
~A good liberal arts education

iwas rated low by the employers.

Dr. Hardy, in analyzing the fig-
ures, said, “full time work ex-
perience in business fields is one-
half again more important than
a good liberal arts education to
prospective business employers.”

“A degree in business adminis-
tration is valued higher than full
time work experience,” he add-
ed.

A final conclusion drawn from
the statistics is that employers
value better-than—average grades
“two times more important than
athletic or fraternity activities.”

Specializaion

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (IP) —- A
trend to less specialization in
higher education, and to greater
understanding of related subjects,
isvbeing chartered at the Univer-
sity of Illinois, according to Pres-
ident George D. Stoddard.

He outlined an educational pat-
tern which would. consist of a
central core of specialization, but
also include related studies with-
out a sharp dividing line between
therri.

“To crowd a curriculum with
specialties is to guarantee that
other areas will be neglected; to
fail to develop a single specialty,
following it through to advanced
levels of understanding is to sell
the student short.”

Stating that every large uni-
versity has suffered from the fault
of too great departmental special-
ization in teaching, he said that
reports are already available

cidents occur because oi‘ inad- here, and discussions under way
vertent stalls. to overcome this weakness.
