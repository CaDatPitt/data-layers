V University,

-a—:-

A Pennsylvania legisla-
tor’s argument to scissor
state aid allocations to the
owing to its
standing as a private
school, has prompted a
challenge from Chancellor
Litchﬁeld to debate the
matter on television.

(WIIC-TV hasoffered to
provide free air time for
such a debate.)

Rep. Edward D. McN ally,
D, Cambria County, charg-

ed that the University is’

using state funds at the ex-
pense of 14 state supported
colleges. His attack on pri-

-v----_

vate institutions took place

‘before joint House-Senate

Apepropriations Committees
and in - the presence of
Chancellor Litchﬁeld.
“I’m against this legal-
ized giveaway-,” said Mc-
Nally. His reference was to
$100 million a year, which,

he said, is representative of '

state aid to private colleges
and, which, according to
McNally should be divert-
ed to create state colleges
with their lower costs.
Costs" Too High
McNally asserted that
student costs at the Uni-

varsity are too high for the
lower income families. He
directed his verbal assault
to presidents of the Penn-
sylvania State University
and the University of

Pennsylvania, as well as,

Chancellor Litchﬁeld.

“I’m sick and tired of
voting money for the.
carriage trade,” McNally
contended.

Litchﬁeld ' answered the
blast with:.
“You sir, do not know

the facts. The average, fam- '

ily income’ of the Pitt stu-

. sylvania

call that the ‘carriage
trade.’ '
Pay For Time

He then told McNally he
would personally pay for a
half-hour of_television time
—' in Pittsburgh or Cam-
bria County — if the state
representative would agree
to debate the case, each
taking 15 minutes to pre-
sent , his ,“story”, to, the

' viewing audience.

“I’m certain that the
peopleof Western Penn-
will respond
-three-to-one in my favor,”

said the Chancellor.

McNally_ indicated that

he might accept the Chan- 0

on television. He was
rather doubtful, however,
that the bill in point, call-

SG Senate Amends Own Constitutions
S Landy Pushes Minor Reforms; 
. New Constitution Voted Dwn

By JOSEY GROSSMAN

Student Government approved four amendments Thursday night to strengthen cer-i 
tain inefﬁciences in the present constitution, after it defeated a - proposal for/a University.
Council to replace the -SG Senate. (See text page two.) . / .. ’ ~ V

Referendum for the amendments will be called either Feb. 17 or 19,'President Mar- .
tin Landy announced, the date to be announced immediately after arrangements are deﬁn-
ite. ‘ '

Landy revealed that he had been involved in both plans, butthat he would recom— ,
mend only the amendments to the Senate. “T here is no certainty-that the University Coun-

cil would work,” he explained, “It might even be a step backward. But there is a 'reason- _-
able assertion that these amendments will rectify present ﬂaws and?

may start a series of slow, rational changes to improve the structure.”   o _ . 
Landy commended the Senate for the job it had done this J“ ge dlS€I't _ . 
year, and urged the group tobe “sophisticated, mature, and not ' ,:f._r

act like silly little children who think by changing Student Gov-
ernment they would be" casting dispersion upon themselves.”
Les Plack, vice-president of the Student Union Board, intro-
duced ﬁrst the proposal forla University Council, a plan drawn up
This year’s Tap Day has been 
changed from Feb. 28 to Feb. 27,
according to Harriet Hersh, publij 
licity ‘chairman for Tap Day. ‘ V

 

‘ MARTY LANDY,.president of Student Government, presented a
series of amendments to the SG constitution which were passed by
the -Senate despite the introduction of an entirely new constitution
by Les Plack from the SU Board. ‘

byga number of campus leaders who sought mainly to insure a group
of qualiﬁed council members.

The president of the Council would name a» nominating commit-
tee of at least ten leading seniors representative of major campus
groups to nominate a slote of 15 to 20 select students. The student
body, by popular election, would choose 11 to serve on the University
Council.

V The main Senate objection was that the plan was undemo-
cratic, that it provided noﬂrepresentation, that it removed a demo-
cratic training ground, and that it would be too difficult for a student’
with another major responsibility and carrying a full credit load to
assume this other responsibility.

Landy stressed that “we are working within a democratic _
framework, and when we say that we want a narrow group of
philosopher kings we are saying that democracy is not applicable
here. It is saying that the electorate is unworthy,.when it is the
college student who will eventually comprise the bulk of the na- '
tional electorate.” . ‘ -

The main problem Landy saw in the presenttconstitution, which
could be changed by the amendments, included 1) since anyone can
run for election. and a popularity contest often results, there is often
dead weight in the Senate 2) students going trimester don’t run.

F 3) Every time a structural change is needed in the constitution
SG must go to the students, but if this were eliminated future
bodies could use this for their own interests; a solution would be a
referendum only if the Senate were seriously divided on the matter
and 4) students in the pre-professional schools do not have as much
time to devote to SG as Liberal Arts students do,. but they still need
representation. - . ‘ _ _

The ﬁrst proposed ‘amendment eliminates the need for referen-
dums for mmorstructural changes. As now stands, the Senate shall
propose -amendments whenever 2/3 of the Senate deems it necessary.

W Dr. Cohen is Meteor  

Theory Confirmed

A University professpr’s theory that pinpoints the loca-
tions on earthof ancient tektite showers from space has re-
cently been conﬁrmed for the second time.

Dr. Alvin J. Cohen, professor of Geochemistry in the
University’s‘ Department of Earth. and Planetary Sciences
and a member of the University’s Space Research and
Coordination Center, was the ﬁrst scientist to link speciﬁc earth
craters to distant ﬁelds of glassy
debris called tektites.

Dr. Cohen ﬁrst presented his
theory at a 'l961 meeting of the
American Geophysical Union. Re-
cently’ a laboratory in Germany’
conﬁrmed the theory by linking
a crater in Ghana, Africa, with
debris scattered 180, miles to the
west of it. Both were found to be
1,300,000 years old.

Predicted Earlier
Dr. Cohen had earlier predicted
such a link between the ‘six-and-
a-half-mile wide Bosumtwi
Crater in Ghana and tektites

The German laboratory,
the Max-Planck -Institute of
Nuclear Physics at the Uni- . " -
Versity of Heidelberg, deter- DR-V ALVIN J- COHEN _
mined the age of the crater from asample of tektite found there
and matched this with tektite found 180 miles away that was sub-'
mitted by Dr. Cohen. \ l ‘

These melted bits of rock that are deﬁnitely related to the

. craters prove that an object from outer space hurls molten, chunks

ofearth. skyward on impact with the earth. These chunks then re-
enter the atmosphere, coolito glass and land at a distance from the
original - impact. ~ -’

This ﬁnding opposes another theory of some scientists who con-
tend tha_t- these chunks were swept off the moon by asteroidal colli-
sions. with the satellite and showered the earth. Dr. Cohen leads

the opposing school of thought whose theories were supported by,

the latest ﬁndings. _

Dr. Cohen believes that tektites similar to the earth variety will
be found on the moon; therefore, he suggests that the government
step up its research in tektites. “Searching for these earth craters
and investigating them will be costly and will involve deep rock drill-
ing‘ operations, but knowledge about these terrestrial craters will
lead to a- better understanding of the nature of the craters on the
moon’s surface,” _Dr. Cohen said. _- ‘

The professor’s theory was ﬁrst borne out in 1961 when an 18-
mile crater in Southern Bavaria and tektites found in Czechoslovakia
150 miles away’ were linked. These were found to be 14,900,000
years old. ‘ ’

Dr. Cohen has several predictions as yet unconﬁrmed. He
believes that a crater must exist somewhere between Georgia and
Texas that matches in age tektites found in Massachusetts and those
two state. These tektites are 33,000,000 years old.

' “Fun in Acapulco” answers the question, “Whatever
Happened to Movie Musicals?” The answer is that movie
musicals, if this ﬁlm is to be taken for an example, are about
to go under for the third time. I can’t throw the blame entire-
ly on Elvis Presley, who sang off-key at the age of eighteen,

and now at theage of,26 is more oit-key -than ever. Nor
will I throw the blame on the¢

producer, director, scenarist and

The latest effort ‘from Colonel
Tom’ Parker’s million-dolla_r talent
takes place in the lush, colorful
and beautiful setting of Acapulco
where our hero portrays an en-
tertainer-lifesaver who is on leave
from his paents’ circus act because
he accidentally dropped his broth-
er in their aerial act. He has come
to the resort area to recover from
a case of nerves and also to in-
dulge in a bit of romance and rev-
elry. "He meets Ursula Andress

ing able to wear a bikini. Also
around the hotel are a lady bull-
ﬁghter whose name I didn’t catch

‘ drafted by a group of seniors who were, for the most

, part, not members of SG but who /had discussedthe prob-

1‘ lems confronting SG and had, they believed,’ decided

upon a plan which would help to alleviate most of those
problems. (That constitution is reprinted on page two).

We do not believe that this is the proper time to go

into a discussion of that constitution, however, it is our

p contention that the new constitution, was not given a
' "fair chance by the Senate.

V There were many senators present at the meeting
who had either seen the constitution before hand or who

V had been told of it by others. These people were against
,it from the start. They were against it because it called

* for a change in the status quo. Theyiwere against it be-

 cause it would put most of them out of a job. They ,
were ‘against it because it cut'the number of members

i in" the group» by 70 per cent, thus reducing by the same.
percentage the number of people who could have ‘SG
Senator’ after their name in the yearbook.. In a word,

V they wereagainst it because they felt it was bad for the —
‘Senators. They were not against it because they felt it
was ‘bad for the students — "that large body of people
who elected them to oﬁ’ice.and whose interests they are
supposed to represent.

,To insure that those people who would have been
able to explain the new constitution could not interfere
with the Senate’s voting it down, the meeting was de-

‘ clared closed to all outsiders, yet one girl, not a member
of SG, was admitted to the meeting and even was per-

. mitted to speak up against the constitution. Incidentally,
she is a candidate for next year’s senate.

The whole affair was a huge farce. The new constitu-
tion was dead before it ever entered the door. In lieu
of the shoddy-manner in which the affair was handled
by’ SG, The Pitt News feels obliged to raise the question
as to whether the Senate has the right to decide for the
students —— changing any constitution is- a ‘matter for
the voters — that they might continue to be governed
under the present,status—is-everything system.

A ‘New Parlor Game . . . .

SomeHave It-Some Don't

For those of you that might be inter-
ested, I have discovered a new parlor game
that is vastly diﬁerent from the norm. By
the norm, I refer to such goodies as spin-
the-bottle, post-office,‘ and
the like, which are Wonder-
ful facets of the. 20th Cen-
tury» Americana, but are
not exactly aesthetic exper-
iences. This new game is
called “duende,” and please
do not say "‘God Bless
You!” It is a game that
was started ‘by a former
Boston—American column-
ist named George Frazier
who is now one of the better free—lance
article writers in the country. .

“Duende”.is as Spanish word that is im-
possible to translate into English. I’m sure
that all of you have known some foreign
word or expression that has proven
untranslatable in common English
terms. Now that I think of it, “duende” is
more of a conversation piece than a game
and could be-used to ﬁll many empty
moments. All it takes is —a knowledge of

.the world around us and a certain method
of using that "miserable work known as
“taste.” I will demonstrate:

A According to Dr. Frazier, the following
people have “duende” and the next group
does not. I think you will catch on shortly.
For instance: 1. Sir Laurence Olivier -has
it; Sir Geilgud doesn’t. 2. Ella Fitzgerald

has it; Sarah Vaughn does not; 3. Ernest .

Hemingway -has. it; William Faulkner
doesn’t. 4. Lorenz Hart has it; Oscar Ham-

merstein doesn’t. 52 Willie" Mays si; Mickey.

Mantle no. 6. Shakespeare has it; Marlowe
lacks it. 7. Jimmy Brown yes, Jimmy Tay-
lor no. Caught on, yet? «

Well, basically this game is one of per-
sonal taste lifted to its highest proportions.

 

By Stan Schweiger

The individuals involved in a tete—a-tete of
“duende” are called upon to have a deﬁnite
sensitivity and an aesthetic feeling about
life and just what appealsto the individual
mind. Be careful when playing ‘along be-
cause certain comparisons are deﬁnitely
“out!” If you say that: 1. The Ronnettes
have it, but The Orlons do not. 2. The St."
Louis Post Dispatch has it, but the New
York Times doesn’t. 3., Federica Fellini has
it, but Michaelangelo 'Antonioni hasn’t. 4.
The “Beverly Hillbillies” sure as shootin’
has it, but “Petticoat Junction” can’t rightly
hold a candle to it. 5. Steve Alleniyes,
Johnny Carson no- I repeat for the West

~Coast. If you use the aforementioned ﬁve

items, then you just haven’t gotten the
hang of it by now. But don’_t fret'my friends
because there is still more. 1

One of the basic misgivings about
“duende” is the fact that titles cannot be
used. Many of my fellow playmates seem
to burst their blood vessels ‘becausel won’t
allow them to say that A Farewell to Arms
has it and Sanctuary doesn’t or Death of a

‘Salesman has it and Picnic does not; It’s

even more fun when you turn around and
say something 'like,"‘Which has it — The
Merchant of Venice or Hamlet? And why?
This completely throws your customers,
but as I said before, the use of titles
should be prohibited. A special dispensa-
tion is needed for the use of titles and if
you ask in a nice way, I just might get Mr.

‘Frazier to alter the rules somewhat.

And there my _friends'is -the latest com-
pensation for such things as thumb—twid-
ding, and knocking-your—head-against the
wall. “Duende” is the type of divertissement
that has proven to be, for me. at least,
interesting, amusing, controversial, and
most important of all, entirely different

from the usual run of parlor games. I hope

you’ll try it.

LETTERS 1'0 THE EDITOR

Former Editorial Board Mr

porters are there on your staff,

concerning last semester. .And if

Member Blasts ‘News’
Editor,’ The Pitt News:

The students are distrustful,
the students are ununiﬁed, the
students are irresponsible, un-
intelligent, unrespectable, The
students are unworthy.

Who, Mr. Swetonic, are “the
students?” Are not you included
in this nebulous phrase? Are not
you a perfect example of all you
accuse me of?

The editor of the student
newspaper_ should be a mature,
responsible individual. Part of
his responsibility to the student
body is to bring to their atten-
tion a malfunctioning of student
government. You did this, Mr.
Swetonic. You did this. and more.
‘You brought personalities into it.
"You blamed the ills of SG on
one or two people. At ﬁrst, I
must admit, I was blinded by

your ‘attack. But in the past few-

days, I ‘looked into the situation
myself. . '

And what did I ﬁnd, Mr.
Swetonic? I found that most of
the ills of SG stem from a lack
of interest, on the part of the
students. Personally, I feel that
this lack is being caused by the
state of academic flux at the
University. Many students do
not know quite what to expect
from their courses and are
running scared. Consequently,
all they feel they have time to
do is study. , _

I also found that The Pit t

   
  

9f»   . ’ 9W:’».—I¥1§".1.X;€09 =r.é..= .:..ﬁ.nd..9u ..Whyrecent1y.

Swetonic? How does this
year’s Pitt News compare to last
year’s? Would you say we need-
ed a Matt Nesvisky, much as you
say we need. a Tom Olofson?
Has The Pitt News shown any
sense of responsibility towards
the students? Tell me how, Mr.

Swetonic, and I’ll tell you how

it hasn’t. Allegedly, The Pitt

News has recognized that the.

student body doesn’t always
know what’s going on. Has it told
them, really told them? No. It
childishly said “it’s this fault”

- and pQintéd an accusing ﬁnger -

instead of analyzing the situa-
tion,’ instead of urging the stu-
dents to take a_more active part
in college life, instead of being
constructive.

SG as it stands now is two .

years old. -This year the students
failed to show an active interest

' in it. I don’t think anyone knows
.the reason for this. But, the fact

remains, the interest wasn’t there
this year and for this you want
to destroy SG.

Do you have the good of the
student body in mind, Mr. Swe-
tonic? Or the‘ good of some “in”
group?’ Are you trying to insti-
tute some last ditch power play?
No? Then exactly what are you
trying to do?

Because, Mr.. Swetonic, as
miserably as you say SG has fail-
ed, The Pitt News has failed.
Don’t accuse me of conjecture,
Mr. Swetonic. Remember, I was
on your editorial board. I know
that reporters are hard to come

by and hard to keep. Ivtried to

you really want to play dirty,
I’ll tell you. Publicly.

Examine and evaluate The Pitt
News as you do SG. You’l1 ﬁnd
that the paper has not done much
more than you claim SG has.
Shall we do away with it? Don’t
get indignant, Mr. Swetonic.
Evenrwhile I was ‘on theeditorial
board, many people told me they
felt The Newswas trivial —— but
I could never force myself to
step back and look at it before.
It was too much ‘a part of me.

Perhaps this is your problem.
Step back and take a- good, long
look at yourself and the news-
paper you run before slinging
mud at everyone else in the
University. .

‘ You could be an offender --
distrustful, childish, unrespect-
ful. You could be as much of
the cause of ‘administrative
disrespect of the student body
as I and the rest of my fellow
students.

Perhaps an evaluation of any-
thing constructive The Pitt News
has done would be a good start
towards saving face.

Michigan State won only one inatch in .

losing to the rapidly-improving Panther
wrestlers, 22-5, Saturday at Fitzgerald
Field House; But despite the one-sideness
of the score even a Michigan State fan prob-
ably would havelfelt a _secret desire for the
Panthers to sweep everyimatch. —

The lone Spartan win was scored in the ,

heavyweight division where’ 245-pound Homer

McClure beat Bill Beck, 4-2. McClure, whose’

midsection makes one believe he is ’a chief cause
of the success of the brewing industry in this
country, had a 60 pound weight advantage over
Beck. It was only fair that.Beck should win
over this bully. '

' Beck made a good try at winn_ing and if -it
wasn't for a ﬁrst period mistake he may have
tide the hulking McClure. Beck carelessly al-
lowed himself to be taken down in the ﬁrst
period, but soon escaped 15 seconds later. The

t 15 seconds riding time gave McClure the neces-
sary -time to pick up an extra point at the ,

match’s end.. . ~

Beck escaped twice from the “Fat Man”
with ‘moves that denote his true sport—football.
Coach John Michelosen wishes Beck could es-
cape from the grasp of opposing tacklers the
way he got away from McClure.

Michigan State got its other two points in a
bout which should have been a mismatch in its
favor. Clair Riley, ”a refugee from the 137-
pound division, took on the Spartans’ .Terry
Leonard at 167 pounds and tied him, 4-4, despite
giving up 25 pounds. Leonard escaped at the
closing buzzer to tie thebout. ”

Lee Hall kept up the last second heroics in
the 177-pound match as he remained unbeaten
at17-0, by edging Emerson Boles, 4-3." Hall
scored a take down with less than 30 seconds
remaining to win. Boles was ﬁve seconds short
of getting a riding time point. ' _ i '

The Panthers swept the ﬁrst ﬁve matches
before Riley’s tie. ‘Duff Killian boosted his "mark
to 5-2 by besting Al Huckins; 6-5, at 123-pounds.
At 130-pounds Mike Johnson remained unbeaten
in six bouts and scored the ﬁrst dual meet fall

of his career by pinning Gary Smith at 8:52
‘with a double-double. . V ‘

.Frank O’Korn won his third straight match
since dropping to 137-pounds by edging Joe
Ganz, 5-4, on riding time. Dino Boni continued
to impress at 147-pounds by whipping Dick
Cook, 6-2, to make his record,’6-1. Tom Baily
made his season’s record, 4-3, by trouncing
Monty Byington, 5-1, at 157-pounds. V '

Syracuse Ends Skein,
But Another_’Started
In Win Over F ordham

A tournamentbid was not insured nor was it forfeit-
ed last Weekend ‘as the Panther cagers.split even in a
two game road trip to New York. Friday. the Panthers
had» an eight game winstreak stopped at Syracuse, 96-84,
but Saturday they started another winning skein by downing
Fordham,' 78-70. ’

The loss to Syracuse temporarily put the Panthers out of the
tournament picture, but the triumph over ' M S H 6
Fordham still gives them hope. The .500
record on the road makes Wednesday’s
game against West Virginia at Morgan-
town the most crucial of the season for
the Panthers, who now have a 13-5
record.

Panther coach Bob Timmons said,
“We can’t complain about the road trip.
The team played well enough to win

' both games, but when you’re on the road,
you're lucky to get a split. We scored
enough points to win at Syracuse, but we
couldn’t contain them, especially their big
man.”

The big man was 6-foot-8 Chuck Richards who scored 34
points against the Panthers. Neither Paul Krieger nor Bob
Lovett, both of whom fouled out, could hold Richards.

It was a bad weekend for the Panther centers as they commit-
ed as manyfouls asthey scored ‘points. Each had_nine personal
_fouls called on them. Krieger scored.14 points and Lovett four.

Against the Orangemen only guards Cal Sheffield and Dave
Roman showed any type of consistancy, and Sheffield only in the
second half when he scored 24 of his 26 points. Roman added 22
for a combined total of 48 points. _

Roma,n’s outside shooting against Fordham brought them out of
a zone defense and forced them into a man-to-man. The man-to-
man defense could not contain Brian" Generalovich who scored
26 points, including the go—ahead points, 68-66, with four minutes
remaining.

' As usual, the Rams had ﬁve players in double ﬁgures. The
home team scored one moreﬁeld goal‘ than the Panthers, -but
terrible shooting from the foul line lost the game. Pitt made 24
of 32 ‘while Fordham could only manage 14 of 31.

Against Syracuse, Pitt outshot the Orangemen, 34-32, from‘
the ﬁeld, but Syracuse converted 32 of 49 from the foul line to
gain the victory. “Syracuse is a fast moving, strong ball club,
and we’ll have_a tough time beating them this Saturday,” said
Timmons. _ .

Intheir ﬁrst appearance away from home this season,
the Panther swimmers won a meet and lost one in a trip to
New York.

On Friday the Panthers met the Colgate Red Raiders
and were beaten, 62-33. This was the worst loss the Panthers
have suffered since Syracuse beat them, 68-26, over two
two years ago. ,8 -
The Panthers fared considerably better on Saturday» when

V . V m they completely dominated the meet ,
against the Syracuse Orangemen. _In this
meet, sophomore Andy James .won both

the 50 and 100-yard freestyle sprints.
‘ The‘ most outstanding performance was

  

school record in‘the 200-yard backstroke with
a 2207.2. Rob also won the ‘200-yard free-
style.

Backing up Rob was twin. Ron who also
took two ﬁ-rst places. Ron won the individual
medley and the butterﬂy.

Anyone who believes that

when the Duquesne freshman

game winning streak- with a 74-65
victory.

A total of 66 fouls were commit-
ted in the nearly two hour game

yvhich at times seemed more like
it should have been played on a

football ﬁeld rather than a bask- -

etball court. Eleven players foul-
ed out, including seven Cubs. The
fouls were costly to the Panthers,
however, only in the personnel
department as the Dukes missed
all but 14 of their 51 attempts
from the line.

The Duquesne defense forced
the Cubs to do most of their
Sh00til1E from the outside, and
since the Dukes were controlling
the boards, the Panthers were
seldom able to get more than
one shot.

¢might have -been different if bad

fortune hadn’t overtaken the vis-

Bill DelVecchio sustained‘ an in-

, jury in winning the 60-yard dash,

which kept him out of the mile

relay. His entry in that race .»

probably would have enough to
make up the narrow ‘Navy vic-
tory margin.

In the two -mile relay -the
Panthers led for the ﬁrst mile
and one-half when the runners
from each team collided. The
Navy trackman recovered ﬁrst
and went on to win by less
than a. yard. If the, Panthers
were able to take these two
relays the meet _would have
been much closer, but the Pan-
thers would have still been on
the short end.

Other Panther winners besides
DelVecchio were John Bailey in
the two mile and Al Thomassey
in the 35-pound Weight throw. Joe

second and third, respectively in

ECONOMICS CAN BE CHUCKLES

Many of you have been avoiding economics because it is so

_widely known as “the dismal science.” Oh, good friends, stop.

cheating‘ yourselves of many a laugh and cheer, because eco-
nomics is a positive riot! True, it is called’ the dismal science,
but that is only because it was invented in 1681 by Walter C.
Dismal.

It is easy to understand why Mr. Dismal’s discovery of
economics-is today almost forgotten, for the fact is that he
him_self only stayed with the subject for two or three days.
After that he took up embonpoint, which means fatness. It is
saidthat at his apogee, Mr. Dismal reached 1200 pounds. This
later became known as Guy Fawkes Day.

It was not until 1776 when Adam Smith published his Wealth I

of- Nations (or Oz-ymandias, as it is usually known as) that the
world came to realize what a rosy, twinkly, fun-subject eco-

. nomics is. As Mr. Smith showed in his jocular little treatise,
there is nothing complicatedabout economics.

  

(ﬁg -  . ,5‘ ~ ,. 1 —

    ‘tits later became kzzowrz astte low’; a Parana:

When there is a great demand for a. product, 9. great supply
is placed on the market. When there is a small demand, there
is a small supply. Take, for example, castanets. You walk into
any" average. American town today and I'll wager you won’t see
-more than eighty or ninety castanet shops. That is because the
demand is small. ‘ . .

For Marlboro Cigarettes, .on the other hand, the demand in
great. Thus, you will ﬁnd Mar1boros—with all their yummy
rich tobacco ﬂavor and pure white Selectrate ﬁlter and pliable
soft pack and unpliable Flip-Top box—-at any counter where
cigarettes are sold in every one of our ﬁfty great States and
Duluth.‘ ' .

To Adam Smith, I say, belongs the distinction. of popularizing

economics. Mr. Smith was followed by David Ricardo. In fact,
everywhere he went he was followed»by David Ricardo. Mr.
Smith ﬁnally got so annoyed that he summoned a bobby, as
British policemen are called,‘ and had Mr. Ricardo arrested.
This later became ‘known as the Louisiana Purchase.

Upon his release from gaol, as a British jail is called, Mr.
Ricardo reported to his parole officer, Thomas Robert Malthus.

They soon became fast friends, and one night over a game of .

whist they invented the stock exchange, or chutney, as it is
called in England, ' ‘

Well sir, with the British having, you might say, a corner on
economics, the French decided that they wanted some eco-
nomics too. Being,. however, a proud nation, they refused
simply to borrow British economics, but insisted on inventing
their own. At ﬁrst they tried using the truffle bound as a medium
of exchange. When this proved less than satisfactory, they
switched to pomade. Discouragedr by this second disappoint-
ment, they. ﬁnally shrugged and said, “Oh, who cares about
economics anyhow?” and returned to the guillotine and Maurice
Chevalier.

America, I am pleased to report, had much better success with

( economics. Our early merchants quickly broke down economics
into its two major categories—coins and foldingmoney—~and
today, as a result of their wisdom, we can all enjoy the automatic
toll station. |

Well sir, I could go on and on about this fascinating. subject,
but I know you’re' all in a tearing hurry to rush out and sign

up for Econ I. So I will leave you now with two kindly Words

Of farewell: ‘Gresham’s Law. Q 1964 M3; Shulmgg

I 3 3

We, the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, are tobacconists,
not economists. But this much we know about supply and

demand: you demand full ﬂavor in a ﬁlter cigarette; we ’

supply it—Mar‘Iborol_.
