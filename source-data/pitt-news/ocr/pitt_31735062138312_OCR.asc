A The Junior Promenade of the Class
of 1921 is a matfter of University his-
tory. It is the concensus of opinion of
those who attended that this year’s
Prom was the‘ equal of any of its pre-
decessors in -every particular. When
Chairman G. Herbert McCracken and
Miss Marcella Whittaker Astelllied out
on the ball-room ﬂoor of the Hotel
Schenley, to lead the grand Imarch,
more than 200 couples of ardent Pitt-
ites fell in behind. them._ Ten nimble-
ﬁngered and husky-lunged athletes of
the string and horn, -,c§ol_I1lI_‘l;a.lided by‘
Art-Giles, coaxed the dancers so' per-
suasively that only by great effort did
they hold themselves in line-until the
conclusion of ‘thevgrand march.

room to capacity and overﬂowed into,
the lobby. Despite theformal setting
of the affair, the dancers displayed the
usual Pitt pep. . They came“ for a good
time and left asserting that they had
had it. 

The favors were leather pocket-
books for the girls and leather card-
cases for the men. The programs were
neatly arranged in them. Supper was
served at 11:30. .. ‘ A

The dancing continued until 3
o’clock. ' At 1:30 A_ five well-known

A chance to help boost the Alumni .

 

Right now the membership of the
General Alumni Association nllmbers
about 2800 and the_Alumni secretary
is making a special effort _to,put this
over the 3,000'1_nark within the_ next
month. If possible, hewould like to
add 400 more members, so that with
the members secured’ from the 1920
class in June, the 3500 mark could be
reached before the summer is over,

Quite a few members of the class
of 1916, 1917, 1918 and. 1919 are not
members of the Association and as
they seem to be the best prospects

sellt them, with. application cards‘en-
closed. Samplecopies of The Weekly
telling of the success of the Alumni
Building Campaign, ‘and, the enthus-
iasm in alumni affairs aroused by it,
have also been sent out,
Forty-five graduates" were -added to
the University total at the annual
Charter Day exercises February 19
also, and another letter ‘appeal has
been mailed to them. Their names go
on.-the. alumni records as imem-b‘ers
of the. class of 1920. " .
The two big appeals to the non-
members are. that by joining the asso-
ciation they get The .'Pitt Weekly, and
through it are able to keep in close
‘touch with" Pitt happenings without‘
extra charge, and that during the
football season they getpreference in
the distribution of tickets. There are,
of course, manyiother reasons why
they should affiliate with the army of
loyal Pitt workers, but it‘ is hard to
see how they. can resist these two
named. I
‘If you see a Pitt man or woman and
are ‘in doubt as to whether they are
Association-members, urge them to
join ,Th8Il advise the alumni office if
they say “Yes” and we’ll do the rest.

 

GEORGE ‘BROWN PROS-PERING -

It will be of interest to the many
friends of GeorgefF. Brown, Ex., '13,
_.former var-sitydfooitball star, to learn
that he is now in Delaware, ‘Ohio,
being in charge‘ of the National Fire
Prooﬁng plant there. His -street ad-
dress, is 80 Park avenue. George is
a member of the association, gets
his Pitt Weekly, -and has‘ lots of
“pep” for Pitt. He did his bit in:
the Alumni. Building Campaign.

“Brownie” played halfback on the
great 1910'football_teaul, coached by
“Joe" Thompson and captained . by
“Tex” Richards,‘which wasn't scored"
on. He was a “rip-tearing" sort of
player who always fought to the
last ditch. And the combination of
him and “Billy" Hittner. at the
halves, f‘Tillie" Dewar at quarter-

a ‘back, u and “Tex” Richards _ a.t full-
back‘ was a. real winner, too. - They

the second half had a ‘different aspect:
Coach Flint. must have _done some tall
lecturing between the halves. for the
Blue and Gold men came onto the

5 greatest spurt on thepart of the Pan-
_-,thers or the greatest S1_11mD.°11‘t_he

.'tensity of the struggle was -indicated

 Washington and Jefferson went into‘
the -game with every determination to.

They carried this determination out to

The ‘Washingtonians had garnered
