‘ succeeded Peake as assistant chan—O

cellor for Student Affairs. Dr.
Alan C. Rankingexecutive assist-
ant to the Chancellor, has been
named to the newly-created- post
of assistant chancellor for General
Affairs.

All appointments are; effective
immediately.

These appointments, an-
nounced by Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld, complete the top adminis-
trative positions of the Univer-
sity. They provide leadership
for both the academicand non-
academic areas. '

As vice chancellor for the Dis-
ciplines, Dr. Peake will provide
leadership for three divisions—the
humanities, natural sciences, and
social sciences; the School of Lib-
eral Arts; and the School of Gen-
eral Studies.

Dr. Peake will have the respon-
sibility of encouraging every dis-
ciplinary ﬁeld to recognizethat it
has three responsibilities.

The first responsibility is to
undergraduate instruction, the
second is to its graduate work,
and the third is to provide active
and continuing support for the

~professional schools of the Uni-
versity.

“The area of The Disciplines
must provide a broad base for the
total educational program of the
University,” Chancellor Litchﬁeld
remarked.

Dr. Geise, new assistant chan-
cellor for Student Affairs, will di-
rect the program which provides
all services outsidelthe’ classroom
to undergraduate, graduate, and
professional students.

This area involves the ofﬁces
of the Dean of Students, Dean of
Men, Dean of Women, and chap-
lain; the counseling center,
placement service, admissions
office, and registrar’s office; and
the Student Union and dormi-
tories.

“It will be Dr. Geise’s respon-
sibility to coordinate these func-

tions and provide a uniﬁed pro-
gram which will serve the best in-

’. terests of the entire student body,"

the Chancellor said. -

The responsibilities of the new
position of assistant chancellor for
General Affairs are varied.

They will includethe admin-

istrative leadership for such
widely diversiﬁed University
programs as the University

Press, the University libraries,
and the Cultural and Educa-
tional Exchange Program, as
well as the planning and direc-
tion of public occasions.

Dr. Rankin, who has been ap-
pointed to this post, will continue
his duties as assistant to the Chan-
cellor. ~

Dr. Peake joined the Pitt staff
as assistant chancellonfor student
affairs in July, 1956.‘

His career in education has in-
cluded both teaching and admin-
istrative experience and respon-
sibility for the academic develop-
ment of the schools with which he
has been associated.

He’ served on the faculty and
as assistant dean of the Univer-
sity of Michigan College of Lit-
erature, Science, and Arts from

1947 to 1950, and as dean of ’

Knox College from 1950 to 1956.

Geise has been a member of the
Pitt staff since 1925 and has held
various teaching and administra-
tive positions in which he has
worked closely with Pitt students.

Geise is a graduate of Penn State
University and the University of
Pittsburgh the master of arts and
doctor of philosophy degrees.

Dr. Rankin has been assistant to
the Chancellor since July, 1956,
and had previously been assistant
professor of administration and di-
rector of student aﬁairs’ in the
Graduate School of Business and
Public Administration of Cornell
University.

Lawrence  
  Addresses
F a ll House

By JOANNE DOLINAR
_, Charging . the Republican’
Party with emphasizing the
' negative in the present cam-
paign, Mayor David L. Law-
xrence, Democratic guberna-
torial candidate, addressed
500 Pitt studentsin SU ballroofn
last Friday. *

" Speaking of the campaign of the
Republicans, he said: “The last‘
time I looked, my opponent ‘was
accusing the ﬁsh commission of
turning out undersized trout.” 0

The trouble, he stated, is that
“habit pattern” has led the citiz-
ens “to a meek acceptance that
their state government should be
exploited by whatever combina-
tion of machine politicians happen
to capture and control it.” -

Lawrence declared that the es-
sence of his platform was to “knit
together the people of this State”
into a community of interest.

"‘I am entirely conﬁdent that
wecan do for this state what I
have seen happen in Pittsburgh,"
the Mayor claimed.

“As governor, I will confer with.
elected officials and any Pennsyl-
vanian of goodwill, regardless of
party, on the mutual p_roblems of
their community and the common-
wealth.

“‘I will do my best to consult
with the opposition members of
.the~legislature.” I ,

He stated that until’ we reach
for a vision we will never grasp it.
Leader has reached for it and it

has come closer. Under him'we

will see a “new era of hope and
glory.”

When questioned on the Blue
Laws, Lawrence termed them
“antiquated.” He informed _his
audience that he felt they should
be reformed and the penalty for
their violation made stricter.

Who‘ will ever forget that
time? The whole town turned
out . . . well, maybe not the
' whole town. . .to see little Bob-
by Collegeboundoif to the
University. There he was in
his hand-stained bucks . . .
pleatless khakis . . . and his
varsity sweater.‘ (Badminton _
1, 2, 3, 4.) Sonja . . . ah, Sonja,
his homeroom sweetheart,
sobbed quietly. Sonja had
heard stories about the co-eds.
She was worried.
As the Toonerville local
pulled in, another small cry
was heard. It was Bobby’s
mother. Who will look after
him? Who will warm his milk
and care for his shirts? Then
came the unforgettable reply.
Bobby, head high, shoulders
back, answered . . . “I will!
I will wash my shirts.” Ah,
smart boy. He’ll make the
grade. Gone was the callow-
adolescence . . . for Bobby
Collegebound had bought Van
Heusen“Vantage”Shirts with
his allowance. No longer need
he be tied to Mother's apron.

His all cotton Van Heusen
“Vantage” Shirts need not be
ironed. Bobby Collegebound
could wash his «Van Heusen
“Vantage” Shirts himself . . .

. and in a matter of hours they

would be ready to wear. Day
after day . . . far from home
. . . Bobby would sparkle at
college in his Van Heusen
“Vantage” all cotton, wash
and wear, no-iron shirts.

“Now,” Sonja cried hyster-
ically . . . “I've lost him for-
ever. With all that free time -
in those handsome shirts, he’ll
be the target of every girl on
campus. If only I had passed
bookkeeping I could have
gone, too.”

As the train pulled away,
Bobby’s mother faced east
and said . . .“Thank you, Van
Heusen “Vantage,” for being
like a mother to my son!”

Dr. Peake has demonstrated his qualiﬁcation for the po-

’ procedures in the student affairs area. .

V ‘His work as trouble shooter in thevarious affairs of stu-

other aspects of student interest will continue to be em-

Dr. Peakelshould certainly strive for*;a.revam'ping of the
Social Science area which is sorely in need of close analysis.

duce students_who are thinkers, scholars, and good human
beings. ' . . ._ A

service to the University’ in his -development of the Board

.Dr. Rankin has servedas the right hand man of the

Chancellor for over two years and has an intuitive sense of_

whatis proper, what is necessary for an event. .
He is eminently‘ qualiﬁed as planner and director for

eering, mud-slinging, etal. ‘ ' .

Last Wednesday,"Coun‘ty Democratic Chairman,
John Knox, appeared on “Face the People’-’ and,
rather than face. the issues, Knox .
conveniently avoided them with
vagaries and weak‘ rational_iza-
tions. _

Knox was asked by a panelist
why Governor ‘Leader so rarely
speaks on foreign policy when
this is such :an importantfacet
of a Senator’s role." Knox be-
lievespthat he has spoken on for- ,
eign policy and implied strongly that the press

_ “must -not be reporting what he says. 

This is one of the.weakest‘lines of argument I
have ever ‘heard. The discussion preceding it re-
vealedthat Knox felt or claimed to feel that the
domestic role of _a' Senator is more important than
the ‘international’ one, which: makes Leader a
stronger candidate than Scott.

To this, I can only say, bah!

Leaving indignant Mr. Knox, we come to .the
Friday appearance of Mayor Lawrence to the .Uni-
versity and he did have a few constructive things
~to‘- say. . ' z ‘ ‘ ' ‘ L
 Lawren_ce’s remarks‘
ever, were no more informative in the. University
atmosphere than they have been throughout the
rest of the state. It seems very unlikely to a novice
that an increasechsales tax could provide all the
necessary funds. ' ‘ L ’
Bears "Noble Sears" ,

Lawrence claimed that Governor Leader “bears
the noble scars” but .it appears that Lawrencejs
taking the scars for Leader. Clark speaks on his
foreign policy ‘and the Mayor speaks on his good-
ness; between the both of them, they may bring
him_in. L, " ‘ ., ' g

Mayor Lawrence‘ parried a question on the Blue
Laws in a rathersuprising manner. The audience
clearly expected him to claim that he was against
them, after his prefatoryr remarks about the ‘fact
that ,they_ are antiquated; Instead he proposed ‘to

‘increase the penalties for businessmen who stay

_op'en- on. Sunday. _ .
.' - The mayor claimed that he was not attempting

yet one tends to believe the prevailing opinion that

i should Lawrence and his Democratic running mates

be elected, ‘the Republican Party in Pennsylvania
will be effectively out of the picture for a long,

.long time. ’ . .

‘The Republicans had ‘a big ﬂing at,,the Mosque

‘Turner Says AC Head

Has Lowdstudent Regard.

Editor, The Pitt News:

.Mr. Chris Gillotti, chairrnan of
that Interfraternity Council sub-
committee known as the Allied

Collegiate Party, launched hisfall ‘
I campaign with a statement (The
— Pitt_ News, “Friday, Oct. 1())-- that

indicates his low regard for the
mentality of the Pitt family. \

In fact, his reckless claims are
exceeded only by Papernick’s
tactless and unwarranted attack

’ on Pitt’s sororities "printed in the
same account. _

We of the United ‘Independent
Party feel obliged to comment on
Gillotti’s remarks and point out
several of his main errors.

He opens with the bold asser-

; tion that “In the past the (Allied

Collegiate) party, which repre-

, sents 100 per cent of the student

body, has found greatest support
in the fraternities.” « ‘
Here we must question either
his integrity or his perceptive
abilities. Can a party which has a
handpicked group of fraternity
men handpicking another group
of fraternity 'men for their slate
truly’ claim to represent the whole
-“student, body when it is well
known that only 17 per cent of
.our students belong to fratern-
ities? One does not need to be

Now we should note that the UI
party held, as always, an open,
well advertised slating session to
which all persons were welcome.
We endorsed the bestlqualiﬁed .of
the candidates who sought‘ to be
on our ticket,.,regardless of their
fraternity status, and now can
urge their election with pride.

It is my sincere hope that the
‘vast majority of fraternity lead-
ers, who are responsible and well-

meaning individuals, will see ﬁt

to renounce the present A.C. lead-
ership and- join us in working for

‘vigor and integrity in student gov-

ernment.

The type of bossism represented
by the A.C. chiefs is being replac-
ed by a new brand of student
leadership.

The ‘fnew leader” is. primarily
concerned with the welfare of the
Universityiand all of its students,
rather than narrow .and selﬁsh
group aims, I ﬁifinlylbelieve that
anew day has dawned. Let us all

join in removing the last traces.
of that era! ‘ '

I want to compliment Millard

I am referring to his article on‘

I am reminded of the end of
the Korean War when both sides
were"weary of fighting. -We had

faxught uselessly for months while~

we tried to ﬁnd a' peace where

both sides could save face. When,

we had peace in sight Syngman
Rhee did everything he could to
block the peace.

He even went so far as to free i

prisoners knowing a "peace could
not be negotiated without the re-
turnof all prisoners. We'had~ car-
ried the full weight of the "war;
we had preserved the Republic of
Korea: Syngmarr Rhee’ had seen

war in his country. Still without
.our aid he would have become the

agressor. ,

We hold great military power.
Let us hope we have leaders wise

 A To Discuss Greek Week

 

 

Panliellenic ‘Council [voted
to invite Interfratrenity Coun-
cil to a meeting next Wednes-
day from 3-5 p.m. to discuss
plans for a combined Greek
Week. A‘ -A

Since the executive boards of
both councils in their meetings
this summer were unable to de-
termine a compatible date for
Greek Week because of their com-
pact schedules, it was Panhel’s
opinion that another attempt
should be made to continue the
Pitt tradition of Greek Week.

Panhel Chairmen Nancy Curran
and Dorothy Pridgen also reported
plans for the annual Panhellenic
Reception and,Sing, which will be
held on.Oct. 31 between 8:00 and

,10:30. p.m. at ‘Stephen Foster

Two sororities will be represent-

light refreshments will be served
at the ﬁrst house visited.

As in the past, dress will be in-

  Join The Gang
Out on a .Lirnb

By MURRAY CHASS

By "DAVID BREAKSTONE

A few days ago in an editorial column I observed thatvtrying to
evaluate the signiﬁcance of current world events was a risky busi-
ness. That observation holds true, also, in athletic aﬁairs. The spec-
tator who. turns pundit by stating, for example, that this year’s foot-
ball team is on a par with the ’27 Rose Bowl squad usually is pounced‘
upon by more conservative fans and verb_ally is torn to. pieces.

If this sin of conjecture is a seriousuone, then that of the “edu'—

_ cated guess” is an unforgiveable one. A ﬁne example of how even

prudent sportsmen can unwisely begin "to guess was" provided last

1 _ —week by Arthur Qaley, sports columnist for the New. York Times.

Last Wednesday morning, with the Yanks down threegames to
_one with Milwaukee,/Daley devoted his column to the probability of

.Spahn closing out the Series on two days rest. He decided that despite

Spahn’s fatigue, the Braves would win it for him with their bats.
Then he went out onto the swaying rope bridge by wondering out
loud if the New Yorkers could pull the last two games out,of their
top hats. , I ' V" ‘ _
Answering his own query hesaid, “It could happen, but it would
hardly be smart to wager on such an eventuality.” Naturally, the
“eventuality” ironically materialized. _ '
Having an innate liking for the calculated risk and using the
Panthers’ ﬁrst four games for traction, I think I’ll try that same rope

I ' bridge by guessing about what the football team may do in its re-

maining six games. - .
As far as I am concerned there was little to be ashamed of in
the defeat at Michigan State. Despite sloppy tackling in the ﬁrst half

‘and the jitters which produced A“fumble—itis” throughout, the team

performed quite well. The offense moved smoothly in the second half

and the defense checked most of State’s multiple attack effectively.
"The “breaks” whichlwent against us did not prevent the team

from repeatedly threatening the Spartans’ goal line. With that -lyrical

' "little bit 0’ luck,” wemight have knocked ‘them over. “Of all sad

words of . . . ” The loss ‘was not a demoralizing one, I hope, and I
think it could serve a number of useful purposes. ’ .

First, it should prove to the ‘players that they can handle any
team in the country. Second, it should stop the “nerves” which threat-

" ened near—collapse in the ﬁrst half of both the Minnesota and Michi-

gan State games. Third, it provides the coaches with a sharp goad

to prepare for the Mountaineers’ invasion on Saturday. West Virginia M

always plays its best game of the season against us. Finally, the loss
should prod a couple of the seniors to assume a” more ﬁery, take-
charge attitude on the ﬁeld.

If, by chance, all these purposes are served, and if no more serious
injuries occur, then I have a feeling that the 1958 team needn’t lose
another game. Army, Syracuse, and Notre Dame notwithstanding, the
prospects for the next six games look remarkably" bright from my
