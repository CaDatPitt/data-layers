Supply Additional

Facts in Reply to Investigation Report
In Duquesne Club Tomorrow Night

By William L. Klinkenstein

Chancellor John G. Bowman will answer criticism of the admin-
istration at' the University at the regular fall meeting of the Board
of Trustees tomorrow evening in the Duquesne club.

Dr. Bowman had asked that an opportunity be given him to “sup-
ply additional facts” in reply to the report of the investigating com-

mittee of the board. A brief sumrnary of the report was released at a

special meeting held last month.

“Until that report was made,”
he said, “I had-never seen it nor
knew what it contained. I did not
think it fair that it should be made
public before I had an opportunity to
supply certain additional facts. I
have asked for that opportunity
Tuesday.

“So far as I am concerned, I will
be perfectly willing to have the
whole thing made public after I have
stated my case. I have nothing to"
cover up.”

The report was submitted by a spe-
cial trustees investigating committee
formed at the Chancello_r’s own re-
quest last spring. Chairman of the
committee is A. E. Bfaun, president
of the Farmers’ Deposit National
bank.

Committee Listed

Other investigation committtee
members are: A. W. Robertson,
chairman of the board of the West-
inghouse Electric and Manufacturing
company; E. T. Weir, chairman of the
National Steel corporation; Norman
MacLeod, of Ketchum-MacLeod‘ 8:
Grove, Inc.; Leon Falk,_Jr., ,_Commu-
nity fund head and member of the
Falk foundation; Dr. E. R. ‘Weidlein-,
director of the Mellon Institute; and
C. W. Ridinger, president of the Iron
City Electric company.

The committee was formed at the
time of the protests arising over the
resignation of Dr. John B. Sutherland.
At the time, Dr. Bowman stated that.
the committee would have “complete-
liberty to look into anything they:

want to——the more they look into iti
the better, as far as I'm concerned.”"‘

Secretary of the committee is ‘J1.
Steele Gow, an alumnus, who stated‘-5
at the time that “attention of the
vestigating committee will be givem
to the educational policies and pro--
ceedures of the University. Later
the committee will turn to other mat-
ters, including alumni interests, ath-
letics, and student affairs.”
Univez-sity’s Growth

In its summary of the report re-
leased last month, the committee said
that the University has seen a re-
markable growth in enrollment, fa-
cilities, and services in the
years.

“However, the strength of the Uni-
versity in other respects has not been
developed in pace with its growth.
The result is that the Universitynow

suffersfrom an acute case of ‘grow-‘

ing pains.’ _ That this should not be-,
come a chronic condition, it is now
vitalthatl steps be taken without de-

as it is large.” '

,‘-‘Common Sense
. By ‘Senator’ Z iskind

I lament the disappearance of the paciﬁst.
«Ia "colorful ﬁgure on most college campuses.
lber how he joined peace councils, instigated Oxford
?peace pledges, and pointed his clenched list at whoever
irrlight question his practicality. _ _ , _ 

You remember him, no doubt, as he tramped off
from ‘school sessions and joined his “peace strike.” He
would paint signs urging his fellows to renounce war.
“Never, never, never will we go to war!” he wohld
shout. Then, returning to classes, he would meet up
with the ROTC boys. They would usually jeer him, and
a ﬁght would start.

But this has all ended. For my paciﬁst friend, to-
gether with most of his colleagues, has joined the
ranks of the ROTC. 1

‘ ~' It all came ab_out"this way: First, in Spain, he
saw  clique oI’”"fascist powers ‘indirectly invade its '
borders and destroy its people. At this point, a num-
ber of his boys wavered, and cried deﬁance at the
merciless butchers. Then, with the Hitler march on

Czechoslovakia, with the triumph of his legions in

Poland, with the Russo-German pact mutually con-

ceived for the strangulation of all world decency—-

the paciﬁsts quit and talked about crushing this
ghastly curse.

‘ In his hey day, this lad thought he had a monopoly
on peace. But like millions of other Americans, he was
only sharing a universal desire. When he was aroused,
however, just as all the rest of us, he got mad and
highly incensed over world injustice.

And so the pacifist is just an ordinary fellow.

This is a grim world. Hidden behind its marble
structures, its palatial estatse, its kindly charities-—
are the vicious, plotting, machinations of men. Na-
ture extends its earthquakes and cataclysmic despoil-
ing, but man inﬂicts far more suffering and pain upon
his own kind. Man is his own worst enemy.

Someday perhaps, when the lamps of civilization
are lit, the paciﬁst will bask in the rays of his own
reﬂected glory, and consider himself the watch dog
over peace.

But meanwhile, we practical men, who see the world
for what it is, who recognize the unforseen eventualities
of time and circumstance, say this: Let us think peace,
talk peace, and act peace—and keep our munition plants
running full time.

O . . .
  By Robert Hamilton
Purely as a matter of relief from the verbose and
bombastic outpouring of Senator Ziskind, and others of
his ilk, we got to speculating the other night on just how

much could be done about stopping the rumpus over in
Europe by a small group of determined men with a
great dislike for Hitler and company.

We have, in the course of a checkered career, en-
countered some unbelieveable examples of the vitality,
push, and almost unlimited ability to accomplish nor-
mally impossible things possessed by an aroused and
determined human being. ‘

As a result of these observations, we ﬁrmly be-
lieve that if it were given into our hands to go after
Hitler we would prepare ourselves,-not with an army,
but by picking a half dozen or so men of our acquaint-
ance and getting them steamed up over the Playboy
of Europe.

-01’ course, any half dozen gentlemen would not do.
In the first place, the men would have to be of the
sort who once they set their mind on attaining an.
object, set out for it regardless of the cost. Also, it
would be necessary for them, or some of them, to
have training in certain of the non-paciﬁstic arts and
sciences. _

As we said before, we got to speculating on this sub-
ject the other night, and, after some discussion pro and
con, we set out to pick such a group from the faculty
of our Alma Mater. This particular locality was chosen
because of a remark someone made, “Them as"c‘an,
does, them as can’t, teaches.”

The results, compounds purely from our somewhat
limited experience with the faculty of the school, are
interesting, covering a wi.de range of departments, but
with the honors falling, as might be expected, to the
ROTC instructors. The men, too, are a mixed lot, but
all of them, in our opinion, are men, and admired by us.

It was our original intention to name the gentlemen,
but it has been pointed out to us that they might not
like being directly linked with a project in which as-
sassination is a possible incidental, so we will merely
list them by their faculty positions, deceiving, we hope,
nobody. The list follows. '

First, are three men from the military department,
two of them non-commissioned ofﬁcers, the other a gen-
tleman whose life is made miserable by ignorant, clum-
sy, ROTC freshmen. We would depend on them for
strategy, tactics, and general military knowledge.

Second, is a professor who controls the destinies of
aspiring petroleum engineers”. We pick this man, our
favorite professor (we are not apple polishing, our
ﬁeld is biology) because he has all the qualities re-
quired, and more in abundance.

Third, is a‘ ‘man whom we seem to be almost alone
in admiring, ‘at. least in Pitt (a prophet without honor
in his own country). This man, an ofﬁcer of the Uni-
versity, "has the ﬁghting spirit and no little determina-
tion, and is, quite deﬁnitely, a man. We would ‘be glad
to have him behirld »us in any situation.

Fourth, although we don’t know him very well, but
we believe that he’d,do all right, is a certain publica-
‘tions man. His former job was that of chasing heroes
to pin medals on them, and in the course of this career
he has traveled widely in certain of the more crude por-
tions of the world.

That’s our group, and we feel sure that that bunch
would charge Hell with a bucket of water.

It might interest the faculty to know that while we
considered students in this survey, we were unable to
pick more than three, and that we were not sure of
these. The fault liesinot with the students’ potentiali-
ties, but with their lack of experience. '

Our theory sounds crazy, of course, but we believe
that with these men we could, with the aid of all mod- .
ern appliances, rid the world of Hitler and the hand-
ful of men who support him, without undue difficulty.
Then it would be up to the statesmen with their um-
brellas to bring order out of chaos.

1 ' “Senator” Ziskind

Receives Protest

Editor, The Pitt News:
“Common Sense” as portrayed by “Senator” Ziskind
has a tinge of non-sense. 1
Referring to his article of October 2, we are happy
to see that “Senator” is so optimistic (pronounced

pessimistic) in his viewpoint of American industries and
"“pr'6'sperity.”

It is downright disheartening to think that the great
manufacturers of this nation are being so foolish as to

believe in this period of artiﬁcial prosperity—that-com- '

panies such as _the United States Steel, Bethlehem,
and Jones and Laughlin after years of experience should‘
be making such a tragic mistake.

“Senator” Ziskind presents the opinion of one man,
Mr. Weir, to substantiate his prophecy. Are we now to
accept the “Senator” as our prophet? It is our opinion
that the Honorable “Senator” ‘uses not only the view
that will support his argument, but that Mr. Weir’s'
company is taking advantage of this “artificial” pros-

perity. - —

The “Senator” states that only through the strictest
kind of regulation can the people of the United States
save themselves from the dire effects of the new pros-
perity, which, he believes if unchecked, are inevitable.

To us, “Senator,” the terms “regulation with a
vengeance” and “regimentation” have somewhat an
ugly meaning. Don’t they to you?

Of course you haven’t some form of fascism in mind?
No, of course not, “Senator.” We beg your pardon, but
add that your imagination is rather feeble for one who

pretends to know-so much. Yes, we said pretends.

In concluding let’s look at the “Senator” from a lit-
tle diﬁerent angle. Do you mind, “Comrade.”

Since you look with horror on an artiﬁcial prosper-
ity without strict governmental regulation (bureau-
cratical strangulation), why then, “Senator” do you in-
sist upon the removal of the embargo? It appears that
something is wrong somewhere.

Heil, Ziskind.

Lew Lovell, C41,‘
Ed Lehmann, C41.

The Senator may feel. properly reproved for his
opinion on our economic future. The editor wishes to
apologize to Messrs. Lovell and Lehmann for his tardi-
ness in presenting their letter. Regardless of who is
right in this little quarrel, we’re glad that we live in a
country where we can print both sides of the argument.

‘News

For the Nonoe

By Nancy Welfer

It seems that the Pitt Band does
not care for a certain sentence in
one of our editorials in Friday’s is-
sue. The sentence was, in case you
don’t care to look it up, “. . stu-
dents will exchange the off-tune mu-
sic of the band for the dulcet tones
of Miss Dawn and an accordion.”

First, let us make our position
clear. We cast no aspersions on the
band’s marching or rehearsing, mere-
ly on their music. We think the
band looks ducky out on the football
ﬁeld, marching up and down and
dancing and singing and spelling out
]WOl‘dS and making ﬁgures and doing
all sorts of things. But they do hit
sour notes every once in a while.

Now ‘maybe it was simply the new.
ampliﬁers in front of us at the West
Virginia game, but the music was a
trifle, shall-‘we-say’, brassy. ‘And of
course the visiting band was on the
ﬁeld so long that our most-praise-
worthy organization had very little
time left to show their stuff, in the
vernacular. So maybe we just didn’t
have a chance to make a fair judg-
ment.

We are delighted with the thor-
oughness with which the band reads
our paper, and we must congratu-
late them on their united spirit.
Every member that we met seemed
to feel the editorial a deﬁnite slam
at himself. ‘Surely it couldn’t be
guilty consciences.

So let’s all get together this week
and practice and practice and prac-
And if you’re all good boys
and don’t hit any off-tune notes at
all at the next game, we’ll give you
all a free copy of the paper.

By the way, boys, have you for-
gotten the Southern Methodist band

Letters To  
The Editor

Band Members
Barrage Editor

We benighted ’students who ‘are in‘
the” University Band havellto stand
for a lot. We put in eight hours a
week at marching drills and musical

rehearsals. Snow, rain, sleet, hail,
or high water. we march at the
games.

The Band is acclaimed by compe-

in the East. Everyone has heard
about the “Big Apple,” “Lambeth
Walk,” and other novel formations.
Musically as well as in marching, we
have kept a high rating.

‘leader who attended our Thursday
rehearsal with Miss Dawn, “The
Pitt Band is the best college band
.I’ve ever heard, and I’ve heard
‘plenty of them.”

Why, oh why, did we get such a
dirty dig in The News editorial Fri-
day. Of all the places from which
to expect such support. The News
should be the first not the last to rec-
ognize us. What a slam!’ Don’t ever"
show up at a Band drill, Mr; Editor.
’ Irately yours,

From the Band

Editor, The Pitt News: '

The Pitt Band is furious, and be-
sides that mad. In the ﬁrst place,
the star of the pep assembly was not

w 

‘e.

jDolly Dawn, but the football team.

And what about Coach Bowser. We
think if anyone deserves a hand, it
is our head coach.

Miss Dawn was good, we’11 admit,
but you can’t truthfully say that the
Pitt Band is off tune. This Band is
the best marching and playing band
in the country, and it's about time
we’re recognized . . especially by
you mr. editorial writer.

The band doesn't ask anything ex-
cept that if you can’t boost us, at
least don’t boot us. We know, and
have been told by many others, that
we are good.

Come to your senses, friend, and
give -us a little credit. The Pitt Band
works long and hard, but we don’t
get paid for-it so all we ask is a
little appreciation.

YOU CAN STAY? BUT THAT
STUFF ABOUT THE PITT BAND
HAS GOTTA GO!!!!! (and when you
gotta go, you gotta go)-

Yours contemptuously
and with fury, .

The News oﬁers to the Pitt Band
on humble, apology ft)?‘ its indiscreet
use of adjectives in Friday’s editor-
ial. The News realizes that the Pitt

resenting the University to the pub-
lic. The News belicvesthat the Pitt

had some of the ﬁnest former high school stars who have shone in

Cassiano Scores Both Touchdowns on Passes
From Narick; George McAfee Stars for Duke ;

Kish’s Placements Gwe Pitt Victory Margin
By Bert Jaffe

The battery of Emil N arick pitching and Dick Cassiano catching
added to Kish’s extra pointing was enough to give Pitt a well-earned
ball game over Duke S,atui-day by a one-point margin, 14-13. _

A rugged Blue Devil team swept down to an early score, but this
was nulliﬁed by strikes from the right arm of Narick.

Climax of the game was Wes Me.-'\fee’s third period fumble itfter
breaking through the Pitt line and¢
going 27 yards, only to come up On
his feet with the ball resting in the
arms of Cassiano, From this point
Pitt put together two ﬁrst downs and
a pass from Narick to Cassiano for 3
touchdown and victory with Kish’s
conversion.

Duke scored late in the ﬁrst quar-
ter after George McAfee, the South-
1and’s .leading triple-thI‘eate.1‘, Went:
around his own right endto the Pitt:

verse with Darnell coming around
from his end position to run for at
19-yard gain. A short pass and two

line thrusts gave the Dukes another

ﬁrst down on the 13.

Three smashes into the Pitt line
only picked up six yards, and Ruffa
went back to place-kick. However,
the ball was snapped directly to
Tony, and his short. pass to George.
McAfee in" the ﬂat put the “Iron
Dukes” back into the lead. Ruffa,
the man who never misses, proved
himself human when his placement
sailed wide to the right.

Duke Leads at Half ,

It was 13-7 in Duke’s favor as the
third period ‘began, but the Pan-
thers were determined to get back
into the game. And it was their alert-
ness that gave them their chance.

When Wes 1\/lcAfee got away for 27
yards, it looked like another Duke
touchdown, but Dandy Dick Cassiano,

Ball hawking by the Pittsburgh
team was mainly responsible for the
home team win. Pitt recovered three
Duke fumbles in four chances and
intercepted the only lateral attempted
by the Dukes.

First downs favored the Durham
gridders, eight to six, with the Dukes

Both teams exhibited clean sports-

Penn State’s frosh gridders gave
Charley Bowser full warning of what
to expect next year by trouncing the
Panther Cubs, 25-0, last Saturday at
State College.

Fullback Ralph Ventresco, former
Pitcairn ace, and quarterback Earl
Brown kept Pitt backing up the en-
tire game with their slashing play.

During the ﬁrst period, neither
club made much headway, but in the
second quarter, Ventresco went over
center for ﬁve yards, then lateraled
to Brown, who stepped off 51 yards
fora touchdown. Ventresco place
kicked the seventh point.

A 20-yard sprint through left
tackle by Ventresco set up another
score in the third period. On the fol-
lowing play, Ralph bucked over from
the two. ‘

The little Lions were unstoppable
in the ﬁnal quarter. Bob Rice went
31 yards to score on a reverse from
Ventresco, and Brown hit right tackle
for 18 yards and the ﬁnal six points.

Exhibit American Art

By Anita Barone

An exhibition representing the un-
conventional side of the American
tradition of art, namely folk art, is
now on display in the Fine Arts Gal-
leries on the seventh ﬂoor.

According to Walter Read Hovey,
head of the department of ﬁne arts,
the exhibit is probably the most out-
standing; collection of folk art that
Pittsburgh has ever had.

Oil Paintings Included

The show includes oil paintings on
canvas and wood, which are realistic
portraits, paintings on velvet, usual-
ly done by young girls in academies;
embroidered mourning pictures;
water colors; paintings on glass;
fraktur illuminations which are illu-
minated handwritings recording
births, marriages, deaths and family
lineages.

Among the oil paintings are the
very famous ones of Edward Hicks, a
Quaker preacher who earned his liv-
ing painting signs and houses. He
is represented by two pictures, one
of the “Peaceable Kingdoms,” and
another called “The Lion Family.”

Besides the paintings there are
sculptures in wood and iron includ-
ing weather vanes and children’s
toys. One of the weather vanes, a
wooden cock, is the oldest in exist-
ence.

Gall.atin’s Pottery Shown

There are examples of Pennsyl-
vania Dutch pie plates, stove plates,
salt glaze stoneware, and the pottery
of Albert _Gallatin, from the Pitts-
burgh area, loaned for the exhibition
by Chancellor John G. Bowman.

The pictures and sculptures are
the works of craftsmen and ama-
teurs of the 18th and 19th centuries
who supplied the popular demand
for art. Many of these people had
little training, but had the art of
making things with their hands, an
are which has declined rapidly with
the progress of the machine age.

Folk art cannot be valued as high-
ly as the work of our greatest paint-
ers and sculptors, but is certainly,en-
titled to a" place "‘int.the¢‘~history.i. of
American art.

With _a. few _e_xcept_ions, most , of .. the
objects are from the _Ameri.can‘_AI‘t
gallery in New Y}ork- I

The exhibition will continue until
November 9.

ary physics fraternity, will 2 sponsor
its annual weiner roast Saturday

Hodges Discusses Social Life,

Classes at German Universities

By Mary Lou Caldwell

A year in a foreign university, with
no roll checkings, assignments, ex-
aminations, nor grades, might be any
student’s idea of Shangri-La, but
Tom Hodges, special student in the
College, after having tasted these
educational liberties, is glad to be
back on native soil again-

Hodges, in an exchange of students,
sponsored by Phi Delta Theta, men’s
social fraternity, and the University
in conjunction with German univer-
sities, was able to spend the past year
studying in Germany. Wolfgang
Schulte will be remembered as the
German student, who as the German
exchange, took Hodges’ place at the
University last year.

Landing Germany early in Sep-
tember, Hodges enrolled ﬁrst in the
University of Hamburg where he
studied until October. He then at-
tended the University of Wuewy-
burg until March, when he registered
and completed his studies at the Uni-
versity of Berlin. “Which is a lot of
universities and territory to cover for
a stranger in a foreign land,” observes
Hodges, “but the experience was in-
triguing.”

University social life in Germany
is far removed from that on which
There
isn’t much “social-shindigging” con-
nected with the schools. There are,
however, student clubs formed out-
side which hold dances and other af-
fairs. “Originally there were inde-

pendent fraternities, but since Hitler
‘revolutionized in 1933.’ fraternities
were incorporated into one general
group, the ‘Studenten Bund,’ Hodges‘
explained.

All Hodges’ classes were conducted
i.n the German language which he
managed to pick up after six weeks.
The German professors differ in one
fundamental manner from ours in
their teaching, he reports: “Their
approach to their classes is complete-
ly didactic——they harbor no discus--
sions or conﬂicting opinions in class-
es.”

The German students, he believes,
are quite dissimilar to American stu-
dents in general. They possess a-
more sober outlook on life, perhaps
the result of a compulsory law which
requires each man, after being grad-
uated from the gymnasium, to serve
six months in the labor corps fol--
lowed by two years of military serv-
ice. The German student is thus-
usually older than the American:
soldier. Only men attend the Ger-
man universities.

Hodges, an English major and Ger-
man minor, learned much of both
languages during his year’s stay
abroad. English, there, is a preferred‘
tongue, and is compulsory in most of
the courses.

When pressed for his general im-
pression of Germany, Hodges played‘
safe by replying, “I’d better reserve
judgment until I know more about
it!”
