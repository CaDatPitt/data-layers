Block P Bars Delts

From Participation

Chairman Calls Fraternity Uncooperative;

Luci Claims “Not Tota

By PAUL SCHWARTZ .

Block P, the student ﬁashc

has taken official action against Delta Tau Delta Fraternity
for the breaking of several rules set up in the Block P con-

stitution.

Art Bloom, Bus. Ad. ’59, chairman of Block P, announc-i
ed on Monday that upon recommendation from the Dean of

l Cause” of Trouble

ard section at the University,

Students Office and upon a ur ani—¢
mous vote of the Block P execu-
tive Committee (composed of ten
members), Delta Tau Delta Fra-
ternity has been barred from fur-
ther participation in the Block.
Charging the Fraternity with
turning over improper cards on
purpose and generally attempting
to disrupt the proceedings, Bloom
stated, “It only takes about eight
minutes for Block P participation.
Anyone who does not wish to co-
operate does not have to sit in the
Block.”
Enforcement by Police
“From now on rigid enforce-
ment will be upheld, with the aid
of the city police, to see that no
one V\.'liO is not a member enters
Block P."
from the Dean of Students
Office, which sent the recom-
mendation and will continue to
do so if necessary‘, Jack Hard-
man, the Block P adviser, stat-
ed, “It is hoped that through
such student-initiated action as
the Block P executive commit-
tee carried out in regard to this

particular conduct problem,
other students and student or-
ganizations will realize how

easily a good display of student
spirit, can be disrupted ‘by in-
different or irresponsible stu-
dent participation.” I

Jim Luci, Arts ’59, President of
Delta Tau Delta, countered with,

“We believe, contrary to the offi-
cers of Block P and certain mem-
bers “of the administration, that
we are neither the leaders of the
trouble nor the total cause of it.”
Top Flashcard Section

He continued, “We do not con-
tribute the trouble to poor organ-
ization but to very tactless or-
ganization in the handling of the
students in Block P.”

Bob DiCicco, Arts ’60, assist-
ant chairman of Block P, spoke
of the many warnings Delta
Tau Delta has received in the
past. “Block P is rapidly be-
coming one of the top ﬂashcard
sections in the country. This ‘
development is closely coordin-
ated with planning and good
organization within the Block.”

“So it was only with careful
consideration that the executive
committee reached its decision.”

Chairman Art Bloom said, “If
you want to put on something
perfect, you can’t have anyone
making mistakes. Accidental mis-
takes can be overlooked, but when
trouble is caused on purpose, it is
inexcusable.”

He continued, “There are cer-
tain rules and regulations which
must be abided by. A very fund-
amental one is participating fully
in the various formations at half-
time. Delta Tau Delta did not
do this.”

PICTURED above is one of the stunts Block P will perform this
Saturday afternoon for the Pitt-West Virginia Homecoming game.
Block P is said to be fast becoming “one of the top ﬂashboard sec-l

SGA Questions

Special Passes

Woody Turner, Arts ’6l. and
John L. Sullivan, Arts ’61, ex-
pressed concern for the large
number of non—studcnts sitting in
the Pitt student section during the
footbzill games, at the S.C.A. nicot-
ing last l\londa_V.

As a result, Frank Carver,
graduate manager of athletics was
contacted concerning the amount,
the number and the reasons why
n u m b e r seven complimentary
passes are awarded in the student
section for each home football
game.

Mr. Carver said that number

Allied Collegiates Win
ll But Frosh Cabinet

Judy Reynolds,

J ol1n Gooding

Win For SGA;
By l\/IURRAY CHASS

The Allied Collegiate Party
virtually swept clean Wed-

nesday’s elections for two
freshman S t u d e n t Govern-
ment Association positions

and 24 class cabinet posts.

The only division in which the
United Independent Party showed
strength was the Freshman Class
Cabinet in the School of Liberal
Arts where three out of the four
students elected ran on the UI
slate.

A total of 781 ballots, rather
high for :1 special election, was
cast. In all, the Collegiates won
20 positions; the Independents,
thrcc; one candidate was on both
tickets; and two men running with
no party support won.

However, only ﬁive of the vic-
torious AC’s ran in places where
they were opposed by UI’s. In
similar situations two Independ-
ents defeatcd AC‘s.

In the race for the two SGA
spots, Judy Reynolds, running
with the backing of both parties,
and John Gooding (AC) had 472
and 364 votes, respectively. UI
candidate Woody Higgins had 239
votes.

In the election for the Liberal
Arts Senior Class Cabinet, there
was only one contest. Panther
Right Halfback Joe Scisly de-
feated ODK President Gary Hess,
32 to 25. The candidates for the
other positions were unopposed:
David Brunero, vice-president;
Nancy Curran, secretary; and Do
Buchek, treasurer. ’

The Junior Class winners
were Lee Thompson_ (AC) over
Bert Nemitz, 68 to 41, for presi-
dent; Henry Richardson, vice
president; Jim Harrison, secre-
tary; and Herb Blitzstein (AC)
over Suzanne Fogarty, 66 to 42,
for treasurer.

Lee Noble (AC) defeated Hart-
well Brown (UI) for president of
the Sophomore Cabinet, 107 to 66.
In the only other contested spot
Jim Groninger (AC) downed Alan
Garﬁnkel and Stewart Grosser for
treasurer. Those running unop-
posed were Vice President Richard
Stein and Secretary Judy Meyers.

Martin Troum, vice president
of the Freshman Cabinet, led
the UI’s in that division with
137 votes, the highest total of
any candidate for a cabinet po-
sition. Jack Smith tallied 125
points for president and John-
ston Vvilliams, treasurer, had
136 votes. The lone AC to win
was Secretary Terry Deglau.

The Business Administration
Cabinet winners are as follows:
Senior Class-—President, Roger
Anderson: Vice President, Charles

O’Donnel; Secretary, James
Brown, and Treasurer, John
Staiger.

Junior Class-—President, Ray
Rowney; Vice President, Frank
Pinkus; Secretary, Sam Kamin;

and Treasurer, Jack Markowitz.
Pinkus and Markowitz were unaf-
filiated while the others were on

;  the AC slate.

last meet at Cornell he broke the
"course record by. a full ten sec-

Along with‘Moran the Lions
have three other boys who are
capable of giving the Panthers
trouble. They are captain Fred
Kerr, Dick ‘Enge1erink and
sophomore Herm Weber.

Penn State is also undefeated.
They have won two ‘meets, ‘ one
from a strong Navy team, and the
other from Cornell which they
defeated last Saturday by the
score of 17 to 42. A .

The Panthers have defeated
Slippery Rock, Westminster, and

runner is Ron Rush who is yet
to be beaten. Behind Rush are
John Cristof, Vince Wojnar, Dale
