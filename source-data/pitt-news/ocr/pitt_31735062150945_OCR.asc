Many students and several mem-
bers of. the faculty have received let-
leis or post ,cards from former~Pi-tt
.students_ now ‘serving with the Fi_f_-
teenth’ U. S. Engineers in France.
This news was received in‘ two in-‘
$t2llllllC‘IllS. The first installment con-
sisted ,of letters written during the
latter. part of August and received
about September 29. The second in-'
stallment consisted of letters written
during theiwcek of__September 1-6 and
received October 15. J ‘

.’l‘h’e. first cards and‘ letters stated

where in-France.” Each vof.the four
.'coln~panies, composing the’ Fifteenth‘
U,. S. Engineers", were detailed upon
_'clilferent duties. Company D, of which
[First Lieutellant L. C. McCandliss,

_ former-assistantvprofess-or o-f civil en-
Vgineering, is second in command, has

been detailed to railway work.=,Cor-
poral Peth, Eng. 117, expresses the
duty of his s1quad'as’being “to hide
little stones under railroad ties.” _

After a mon-th of duty in France,
the newness of the work and sur-

- roundings seems to have worn off,‘-as

shown by'this paragraph from one of‘.
the boys’ letters: .“I heard that Mac
is ’~ dragging» ‘down the. insigniﬁcant‘
"wage of 150 plunx. He ought to join
the army, whe'r'e he’d -make that much
every ﬁve (5) months,_with his board
and "clothes in addition. (Note-—

C At the College Assembly’ of last

The substance of his talk’ was‘ as
follows: “Every man and woman who

with the‘ idea ‘of being able to ulti-
mately gerve his country, to use his
acquisitions not for a selﬁsh purpose,
but for a-broader purpose, -for a’ pur-

"it should ‘be, “Do Ypur‘Best.” If every
individual will -foll-ow this idea, the
present crisis is-_sure, to be shortened.

"‘No im-other has raised her_ -boy to

.‘be a soldier, but neither'_h.as she

raised him to be a doctor, a lawyer‘
or an engineer.’ These professions
‘come only with the development of
-ti-me. We must be -contented, there-
fore, to go into the service of our
country’ if .'it is necessary, with the
‘same views as we go into the medical,
legal or engineering service. \’Ve must

‘A Message ‘to College Students .

The defeat of the Ge-mfhn autocracy
is not -only the task -of armies and
navies, butlof every one who believes
in the -principles of -democracy. It
-is not alone our soldiers and -sailors
who are ﬁghting Germany butev-cry
true‘ 'American should also -be doing
what hefcan. to ‘bring about a speedy
victory." h , ‘ A

Young men and women in our
American universities _ and ' colleges
will soon be playing_ a very real part
in our national“ life. You are prepar-
ing yourself now_ for future’ useful,-
‘ness. Youshould remember always
that‘your ﬁrs-t_-d~u:ty_is to the nation

personal success in public service.

The fact that your country i-s at
war imposes on you" a double- duty
to study as‘ ‘hard as ‘possi-bleanld to
ical-
ly as you can. Live up -to your duty
as well as the men in t-he trenches
are living up Ito theirs?

There iS_, however, one way you
can be,-of immediate assistance t_o
your country. You can purchase and
‘help sell Liberty Bonds. Put’ what
money you «can spare now into the

cash, into whichyou -can at any time
convert these inlteres-t-bearing bonds,
may prove most useful when youare"

. srtarvting to earn your -own living. Buy ,
' Liberty Bon s and urge others" to’

buy them! V

“ON TO .PH_lLLY”  
  IS THE SLOGAN

“On to Philly” is'the cry'o»f the
alumni and -students of Pitt this week’
and-this applies not only to those in
These are. war times
and Pittites are scattered over all
pa_nts of the Eastern coast line. Hun-
dreds of them are anticipating this
game with great pleasure. It will
be the only game of the year that
they will see Pi-tt playland theyare
all anxious to ‘watchthe reconstructed
VVarner outﬁt in action. The ath-
'le'tic authorities are get-tinga block-

’ of passes ‘for all Pitt. men in the serv-

ice who desire to attend the‘ game
and they can get them by calling at
the .Hotel‘Normar_Idie, Chestnut and
36th Streets Saturday" morning.‘ _

The ‘New York Pit-t Club willcorrfei
-over. for the ‘game and will be pre-
pared to do a lot of rooting for the
Blue and-Gold. Secretary F. H. Ram-
sey is handling the arrangements in
his usual systematic style.

The ‘party from Pittsburgh, includ--'
ing the meniibers ofwthe team, will
-leave Pittsburgh at 1 P. M. Friday
and will arrive ‘at West Philadelphia
at 9.316  M. ‘Headquarters will be
at‘ the Hotel Normandie. The round
t_ri railroad ticket is $15.72, and

Pullman round trip i-s $3.00., Ganie -

tickets are $1.50 so that the total ex-
pense won't be over $25.00. Tickets
will be on sale at the Normandie in
the Pitt section. '‘
Alumni who intend to go from.
Pittsburgh should notify -the Gradu-
ate Mana.ger’s oﬂice at once.‘ 'Presi-
dent‘ O’Donnell of the Johnstowh
Club reports that a crowd of Flood
City Pittites will board the ‘train there.

or dentist's waiting room. Have you
one there?

fraternity men are responding to this
great call in a‘ splendid manner. -

“The- work here is very interesting.
It is rough, outdoor, emergency con-
struction, but it is enjoyed by all and
every man has improved physically since
arriving here. — " -

“I have read with interest the ‘Roll of

Honor’ in the WEEKLY and am glad

Pitt men are responding so well."

‘.‘_Iimm‘ie” DeHart,. ‘football star,
now located at Princeton, N. J., can
hardly be_-classed as an alumus yet,
although we are sure that the readers
of -this page (-we’ hope the students
read. it as ’we'll as 'the‘alumni), will
be glad to hear from the little favor-
ite. He ‘says in part:
_ “Read and enjoyed your letter. Also
they PITT VVEEKLY. .It -is ﬁne for you
to keep us all in touch with affairs at
-school and’ how well the team is going.
Although we arekept busy and have"
little time to fol w thescores; there
-ust _be time to see' how George Mc-
Laren is going. That Lehigh score was
a dandy-——sort of reminded me of that
baseball drubbing they gave us. Sies
and Carlson must have enjoyed it.

“I read the WEEKLY and then pass
it on to ‘Barney’ Mulvihill and_‘_Larry'
Williams, two other fellows from school.
Both Law students, I think. ,

“Hope to see you at the Penn game.
One of our instructors here' is an old-
Princeton player and willgo with me.
You may be interested to note that I

letic Director here at Princeton, extend-
