Pitt fraternities begin
canning for charity

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

In an effort to raise $75,000 for
renovations for the Western
Pennsylvania School For the
Blind, the Pitt Greeks have begun
”canning” throughout the univer-
sity area as well as neighboring
cities and suburbs.

Canning involves walking
around and asking people to
deposit their spare change into
small cans.

According to Lee Brody, chair-
man of Greek Week, canning has
been the most lucrative of all
fund raisers. ”|t’s the best way
we've found,” he said.

He noted that donations really
add up and that in the past 10
years, C-reek Week's charitable
activities have netted in excess of
$250,000.

The canning began on Jan. 20
and is scheduled to last for the
next 11 weeks right up until
March's Greek Week.

Brody said, ’’It’s up to the in-
dividual houses to decide [the ex-
tent of their canning], and 
points are given to the house that
averages the most money per
person.

In order to help ”loosen some
of the purse-strings,” the Greeks
have enlisted the aid of local bus-
inesses and merchants to help
promote their charitable ac-
tivities.

Radio disc jockeys Jimmy and
Steve will be plugging upcoming
events over the air. in addition,
Roy Rogers is a major sponsor of
the canning and will take collec-
tions in its restaurants.

Among others, additional spon-

sors include the Stroh’s Brewery
and Cameron Coca-Cola.

As Brody explained, "They are
the lifeline. Without them, we
wouldn't be able to do half of
things we plan on doing.”

”Collecting is -the bread and
butter of Greek Week,” Brody
said; However, he recognizes
some of the problems that come
about from canning. Among
them are the difficulties in acquir-
ing permits to collect in certain
places.

While working to encompass
many of the suburban and urban
areas in the collection process,

Brody said, ’’It is almost impossi— _

ble to get permits some places.”

He hopes that in the future,
more emphasis can be placed on
the Dance Marathon, the other
charitable event during Greek
Week, so as to avoid some of the

. problems that arise within the

11-week canning period.

Some of the people who have
canned in the past believe there
should be a more lenient policy
on the part of communities who
currently forbid collection in their
areas.

Erik Lux of Zeta Beta Tau said,
’’If people see that there is a
[charitable] sticker, they should
allow us to can.  That's my
gripe about it.”

Canning is an accepted prac-
tice among the Greeks. Jon Axels-
son of Delta Tau Delta described
canning as just another event,
”When Greek Week comes, we
pass out cans, and we go out and

‘collect for the designated charity

for that year.”

The total amount raised during
the next two and a half months
will be announced at the Greek
Week Formal on April 8.

The Pittsburgh City Council
decided yesterday to hire its
own lawyer and called for
hearings to investigate Pitts-
burgh’s trash problems.

Currently, City Council must
get their legal opinions from
the City Solicitor's office. The
office of the City Solicitor is a
part of the mayor's staff.

Council members were all
in agreement to hire an out-
side legal council who would
be independent of the mayor.
There was some disagreement
on how the new legal counsel

City Council to look
into trash problem

would be hired.

"We need someone to help
us. Over the year, we give the
City Solicitor’s office enough
work to keep one attorney
busy,” said Councilwoman
Michelle Madoff.

Madoff introduced a bill that L
would have taken a lawyer
from the office of the City Soli-
citor and given him to the City
Council. This was defeated
5-3. -

Many councilmembers
were upset because Madoff's
proposal would involve a
$40,000 increase in the budg-
et for City Council. They also

SGB votes on student funds

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

The Student Government
Board last night approved alloca-
tion requests totaling $2,385, de-
nied a total of $8,320 and
approved budget modifications
totaling $1,931.

The Student American Phar-
maceutical Association was
granted $595 to fund a formal
dance. The original request for
the formal was $1,916; the figure
was revised to exclude the fund-
ing for food. According to Allo-
cations Committee Chairperson
Karen Bohichik, student activities
funds are not to be allocated to
pay for food.

The Board approved $703 for
the Panhellenic Association to at-
tend their regional conference.
The original request was for $914
to send three representatives. Ac-

cording to Bohichik, student
government will fund for only
two representatives to attend con-
ferences.

The lnterfraternity Council
received $463 to attend the same
conference. The lFC’s original re-
quest was for $667 to send three
representatives.

The Pitt Band fraternity, Tau
Beta Sigma, requested $849 to
send three representatives to a
district conference. The Board ap-
proved a revised allocation of
$624 to send two representatives.

The Board denied two separate
requests from the Nursing Stu-
dent Organization. A $1,190 re-
quest to fund travel and lodging
expenses for 20 representatives to
attend the National Nursing Stu-
dent Convention was turned

down on the basis of a previous -

approval of $280 to send two
representatives. The five-day con-

vention is being held in
Pittsburgh.
Also denied the NSO was
$1,130 to fund an awards
ceremony. Bohichik said it is the
Committees policy to recom-
mend denial of funds for awards

ceremonies.

The\Board denied a $6,000 re-
quest from the Panther Scuba
Club to fund travel expenses for
an instructional trip to Key West,
Fla.

The Board approved a $531
budget modification for Panhel.
The money, previously approved
for Lantern Night and the publish-
ing of a rush booklet, will be used
to fund a leadership conference.

The Board also approved a
$1,400 budget modification for
itself. The money, previously ap-
proved for a leadership confer-
ence, will be used to fund the
SGB legal advising program.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, February 2, 1988

Reagan begins final push for Contra aid package .

WASHINGTON —- President
Reagan portrayed his $36.2 mil-
lion Contra aid package Monday
as a last-chance effort to make the
leftist government of Nicaragua
comply with the regional peace
process.

"One question must be an-
swered. Sandinista promises of

’ the past have been broken. Can

we believe them now?” Reagan
asked in a speech before the Na-
tional Religious Broadcasters.

But as Rea*glJn.lspbl<’é,’ the anti-
Contra lobbying intensified on
Capitol Hill with some
Democratic leaders expressing
confidence that the House will
reject the president's aid package
in a vote Wednesday.

Reagan, to the applause of his
audience, argued that the steps
the Nicaraguans have taken to
comply with a regional peace
process ”can be reversed once
the pressure from the freedom
fighters is removed.

”The Sandinistas haven't made

I one concession on their own

without a threat hanging over
them,” Reagan said.
’’It’s just this simple —- the way

to democracy and peace in
Nicaragua is to keep the pressure
on the Sandinistas, taking irrever-
sible steps to comply with the
regional peace plan, and giving
aid to the freedom fighters now,”
Reagan said.

CAT fund fee set to
triple under new plan

HARRISBURG -— The board of
the Catastrophic Loss Trust Fund
voted Monday to triple the $8
per—vehicle fee motorists pay for
catastrophic medical coverage.

The increase, approved 5-3,
would take effect Oct. 1 for peo-
ple whose car registrations are
due after that date. The proposed
increase must still be approved
by the Independent Regulatory
Review Commission.

All three of the board members
opposing the increase were state
lawmakers, who said the public
would be incensed at such a large
hike. -

According to an actuary’s
report, an annual fee per vehicle
of $23.66 was needed to ade-
quately cover the CAT Fund's

NEWS BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED PRESS

benefit obligations for the
1987-88 fiscal year. The board
decided to vote on an even $24
increase. A $35 fee would be
needed to underwrite all claims,
including those from prior years,
the report said.

’’I think it’s entirely too much,”
said Rep. Thomas Michlovic, D-
Allegheny, one of four lawmak-
ers on the CAT Board. ”People
will go Crazy.” .

The fund, created in 1984, pays
for catastrophic medical bills of
between $100,000 and $1 mil-
lion incurred in car accidents.
The initial $5 per vehicle fee was
increased to $8 last year. ’

’’People hated the CAT Fund at
$5 —— hated it worse at $8 —- and
will go wild at $23,” said Rep. J.
Scot Chadwick, R-Bradford,
another board member.

But the board's four public
members and chairman, Insur-
ance Commissioner Constance B.
Foster, said the increase was

needed now to halt continued
growth of the CAT Fund's esti-
mated $270 million to $280 mil-
lion unfunded liability.

lnouye rescinds $8
million appropriation
WASHINGTON — Sen. Daniel
K. lnouye saidMonday he had
”made an error in judgment" and
would ask Congress to rescind an
$8 million appropriation he had
won for construction of schools
for North African Jews living in

A France.

‘But, speaking on the Senate
floor, lnouye also defended his
actions on behalf of the project
and said he was ”disappointed,
hurt and angered by the accusa-
tion that I had supported the ear-
marking because of a $1,000
contribution to my re—election
campaign.”

lnouye began his remarks by
declaring, ”I have made an error
in judgment. I fear that I have em-
barrassed my colleagues. I intend
to correct that error."

He said he would ”move as
quickly as possible” in the Senate
to have the appropriation rescind-

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, February 2, i988

By Stephanie Gruich

Staff Writer

Did you ever think of running
a marathon? Ever wonder why
anyone would want to run one?
Consider the task: it's 26.2 miles
of running. .

What happens when someone
is running? There is more blood
flowing to leg muscles and your
lungs. Essentially there is no brain
involved. Runners should take in
as much oxygen as possible be-
cause if you don't, injuries may
result.

Freddie Fu, M.D., executive
medical director of the Pittsburgh
Marathon and medical director of
the Sports Medicine Institute, said
jokingly that ”logically, no one
should run.”

The most important thing if one
is going to run is to train. He said,
”A smart race is run evenly, at the
level of training. The runners

3

should look for danger signs,
drink plenty of water before and
during the race, and one should
quit if necessary.”

Andrain Leek, a marathon run-
ner, said that the best training is
to build up. Another marathon
runner, Don Norman, said, ”Map
out your program and be mental-
ly prepared.” He also suggested
to be equipped with proper
shoes.

Dr. Fu is preparing for this
year's Pittsburgh Marathon, but
his training is medical. He takes
care of the medical stations
placed throughout the 26.2-mile
course. There will be plenty of
volunteers for the May 1
marathon.

”Last year, there were 3,000
runners, 500,000 spectators, and

A the help was a 1:5 ratio, with the

assistance of doctors, nurses,
medical students, podiatrists,
physical therapists and more,”

Runners begin to train for 1988 Pittsburgh Marathon

said Dr. Fu. He is hoping for the
same this year. There will be 20
stations and a mini-hospital at
mile 15. The preparations are just
precautions. There are many in-
experienced runners and many
other factors such as weather that

‘

gram and be mentally
prepared

—- Don Norman

may affect the marathon runners.
Injuries are always feared.
”People at high risk are those
with known medical problems,
acute illness and those with
unknown medical problems,”
Dr. Fu said.

t.¥,\\ 2 .   ‘. '.'

  

 

The best way to monitor any
risks is to look for warning signs
or with testings such as an EKG.
Other injuries may happen dur-
ing training. Winter is the prime
time to train. Along with winter
comes cold weather. Dr. David
Ellis, a marathon medical direc-
tor, suggested, ”Dress properly
with up to four layers on top, no
more than two on the bottom, by
protecting exposed extremities
and by wearing a hat [up to 40
percent of heat lost is through the
headj.”

He also suggested to run into
the wind and finish with it to
avoid frostbite. If you happen to
get frostbite, Dr. Ellis said, ”re-
warm rapidly with warm
water; don't rub with snow and
don't massage or walk on an in-
jured area.”

Aside from injuries before and
during the race, there may be in-

     

CUT AND LAMINATE

juries after also. Andrain Leek
said, ”After a marathon, recovery
is necessary. A complete break
from training, which wears on the
body, is essential.” To avoid any
kind of injury, Leek said to train
a little bit, a lot of the time, in-
stead of a lot a little of the time.

Also, Don Norman suggested
that the last three weeks are the
most important. ”Cet plenty of
rest. The week of the marathon
eat plenty of [carbohydrates],
drink plenty of juice and stay off
fat and alcohol. The day right be-
fore the race, stay off your feet."

Considering all of this, why
would anyone want to run a
marathon? There are many ad-
vantages, which are mostly per-
sonal. Might it be ”the thrill of
victory or the agony of defeat?”
After running 26.2 miles, my best
guess would be the agony of the
feet!

CHMR uses grants for research and student training

By Mark R. Brown
Staff Writer

Recently, Pitt's Center for
Hazardous Materials Research
recieved a $250,000 grant from
the Ashland Oil Company to
study the impact of the diesel oil
spill in the Monongahela River.

The Center will soon release its
findings on the environmental
impact study of the T987 train
derailment to ‘the citizens of
Bloomfield, wh’ich"“‘CHMR per-
formed free of charge. CHMR
also received a $200,000 grant
from the state's Department of
Environmental Resources to ex-
pand it’s ongoing training pro-
grams for hazardous materials
handling.

Training consists of a 40-hour
week in which classmates work

BL%M COUNTY

closely in a team environment.
The simulated level of toxic
danger escalates progressively,
culminating in a no-win situation
that tests the student's abilities to
correctly cope with a worst—case
scenario. Several loose barrels are
knocked over in a van, their
labels undiscernible. According
to instructor Lawrence Bonino,
”There is no way that the stu-
dents can get into that van
without blowing themselves up
[simulated]. The proper response
that they should have learned is
that the situation is beyond their
abilities, that they should back off
and call a HAZMAT team. An im-

8 passe is a lesson learned.”

Executive Vice President Edg-
ar Berkey said of CHMR, ”We
have many stories here. Besides
the Ashland study, we also run a

hazardous waste hotline that
benefits companies ranging from
Ma and Pa operations to Fortune
500. We're presenting the
Bloomfield Citizens Council our
findings for them soon. We've
completed over 40 projects, to in-
clude Erie County, New York
[Buffalo], Allegheny County and
Fairmont, W.Va.

"Last year, CHMR conducted
over 20 training courses with
1,500 attendees. We have a
hazardous waste minimization
book sold nationwide,” said Ber-
key, who received his Ph.D. from
Cornell. “Pennsylvania is No. 4
in hazardous waste generation,
ranks fourth in Superfund sites
and is No. l in HAZMAT ac-
cidents.

many unknowns. A team ap-
proaching a problem like a spill
is just like going into a wartime
situation,” said Berkey.

Regarding the recent diesel oil
spill, CHMR’s Roger Price of their
Materials Treatment, Processing
and Disposal division said,
”There were no known casualties
from the spill. The primary health
concern from ingesting diesel is
inhaling the fumes when
vomiting.”

According to Price, ”Some
diesel did settle to the bottom of
the rivers, where it is suspended
in solid particles such as
sediment.”

Price stated the he didn't know
if diesel is carcinogenic or not,
and at this point, the impact of
the spill on the ecosystem could
not be estimated. For compari-
son, he cited a spill of aviation
kerosene at a stream near Ebens—
burg, Pa., in which the total eco-

 

system was destroyed, but the g:

water quality recovered within
two months.

”For treatment of contaminat-
ed water, the carbon dosage was
increased, as well as the addition
of bentonite clay to absorb
hydrocarbons onto their surface,”
said Price.

Sam Creeger is the director of
pesticide programs for CHMR
and was with the Environmental
Protection Agency for 12‘/2 years.
Regarding the diesel oil spill,
Creeger said, ”The public is safe.
Diesel can be detected in water
at much lower amounts than it's
harmful. We are investigating the
fish kills and the effects on fowl
and the rest of the ecosystem.
Fortunately, the spill was diluted
every mile that it traveled down.

such as clams may have ingest-
ed the diesel, feeding on it,” said
Creeger.

Meese should step
down during inquiry

Attorney General Edwin Meese has been accused this week
of being aware of a possible plan to bribe officials in an attempt
to win support for the construction of an oil pipeline in Iraq.

Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, named by a
source close to the investigation to be a possible recipient of
a bribe, has said that he was not approached and that he would
not even consider such an offer.

President Reagan has voiced support for Meese, an associ-
ate of his since his term in California, and said that the adminis-
tration will cooperate fully with the investigation. When asked
whether dismissal of Meese was under consideration, White
House Chief of Staff Howard Bakerclaimed that option was
not under consideration. . T

Under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, individuals
and companies are forbidden from making payments to foreign
governments to secure business contracts. The attorney gener-
al is given the responsibility for prosecuting such cases.

In this instance, there is at least the appearance of conflict
of interest on the part of Meese. Until the investigation is com-
plete, he should step down from his duties as attorney gener-
al. For the chief law-enforcement officer of the United States,
such a move would seem necessary.

In a nutshell 

No one, whatever his politics, should have
to pay the price for an undeclared war on the
part of his country.

helped negotiate the release of James Denby, an

Do you realize that, according

over 25,000 Nicaraguans —— not

support for a brutal dictatorship),
we should protest the Contra war
because of its effects on the
Nicaraguan people.

under the Sandinistas, who have
provided health care, education
and land distribution, but the war

Obeyingtherules of grammar

This one goes out to the gen-
tleman in my literature class who
was wearing the offensive T-shirt.

Many T-shirt slogans have
come under fi re recently for their
offensive natures.

On display around campus are
T—shirts bearing naughty four-
letter words, invitations to ”party
(or whatever) naked,” blatant in-
sults and slogans criticizing or
praising political viewponts. A
veritable smorgasbord for the
sensitive and easily offended.

However, I'm a tolerant per-
son. I'm not easily offended. To
paraphrase a great American, I
may not agree with your T-shirt,
but I will defend to the death your
right to wear it.

The T-shirt which offended me
(and you, the wearer, know who
you are) had no religious, racial,
sexual or political overtones. lt
bore no profanity and depicted
no nudity.

The slogan was an advertise-
ment. The name of the advertised
business escapes me, but l be-
lieve it was a video store. Yet
none of this was offensive.

Is the suspense killing you yet?

The thing which offended me
to the point of rage was the ad-

cation is specious for several rea-
sons. First, Nicaragua is not
communist. The government is a
blend of socialist and capitalist

- principles, thus striking a marked

departure from the tenets of Cuba
and the Soviet Union, whose
forms of communism the Reagan
administration so greatly fears.
The Sandinistas advocate eco-
nomic and social justice (state
sponsored education to help the
poor, for example) and mass par-
ticipation in government affairs,
as do most socialist countries.
However, the Sandinistas have
also adopted many concepts of
western capitalist countries such
as separation of powers, judicial

vertiser’s claim that his store is
the place ”where your the ‘A'.''

At this point, anyone who does
not understand my outrage is ad-
vised to go directly tothe nearest
elementary school. (Do not pass
Go. Do not collect your high
school diploma.)

in my extreme youth, I had the

great fortune to know a teacher
who managed to elevate the
study of grammar to a religious
experience. She believed that the
ability to communicate was the
very foundation of a productive
society.

A column appeared in these
pages a few days ago advocating
English as the official language of
the state of Pennsylvania.

The author, Will Young,
defended the bill against charges
that it discriminates against im-
migrants who cannot speak En-
glish. What Young (and the
author of a letter to the editor
criticizing his column) failed to
realize was that if we dis-

criminate against ”those people
who cannot use English lan-
guage,” we discriminate not
against ”a handful of individu-
als," but quite possibly the
majority of Americans.

Let me clarity that I am not a
supercilious prig who insists
upon blind obedience to an ar-
bitrary set of standards such as
the rules of English grammar.
One relaxes when shooting the
breeze withcompanions or writ-
ing a friendly letter to a friend.

The mistake on the T-shirt
which upset me so was not a
result of one person's single lapse
of literacy. That particular error
escaped not only the person who
made it, but the person who ap-
proved it, the person who print-
ed it, the person who sold it and
the person who bought it and
wore it to English Lit 103
yesterday.

We are watching the quality of
our language decline, and the
very people who should revere
the language -— advertisers, pub-
licists and those for whom the
language is the tool of their trades
— are the ones who are legitimiz-
ing its (not it's) decline.

the Contra aid plan

review, the right to organize op-
position parties which may actu-
ally hold political power and the
existence of an opposition press
(although the state of emergency
required the closing of this paper
for approximately one year, it
operated for seven years after the
revolution and is again printing
articles" against the Sandinista
government). No communist
country allows these things.

Second, the Sandinistas are not
Soviet puppets. The United States
was the first country to which
they applied for aid. They only
turned to the Soviets after Reagan
cut off this aid. There was no-
where else for them to go. Or
should they just let their country
fall into ruin?

Third, it is slightly more than
hypocritical for the United States,
which continually espouses the
necessity for a strong defense and

continually increases its weapons
stockpile, to criticize Nicaragua,
which has been under U.S. mili-
tary rule or a U.S.-backed dic-
tatorship for the past 75 years, for
the building up of its defense.
With its long history of U.S. in-
tervention and the continuing
U.S. aggression, Nicaragua
would be foolish not to strength-
en its defense. Clearly, fear of
communism isonly an excuse for
U.S. imperialism. .

Every citizen of this country
must take responsibility for
Nicaragua’s condition if he or she
does not voice opposition to the

administration's policy in that _-

country. The House Contra aid
vote is Feb. 3. Write to your

representative and ask him or her ‘

to stop the killing. .

First chapel to be

built at Camp Davidﬁl

By W. Dale Nelson

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —— On the day
President John F. Kennedy was
assassinated, builder Kenneth
Plummer Jr. was at Camp David,
the retreat in the Maryland coun-
tryside where presidents since
Franklin D. Roosevelt have
relaxed on weekends.

’’I thought it would have been
better if we had had somewhere
to go, a chapel of some kind,"
says Plummer, a prominent
Methodist layman. ”lt’s been a
dream of mine.”

His dream is approaching reali-
zation. President Reagan has ap-
proved plans for an
interdenominational, 150-seat
wood and glass chapel to be built
a short walk from Aspen Lodge,
the presidential cabin.

It will be financed through pri-
vate contributions. Work may be
completed by the time Reagan's
successor moves into the White
House.

’’I went up and put stakes in the
ground for the president and Mrs.
Reagan to look at,” Plummer said
in a telephone interview, adding
that the Reagan approved the site
a few weeks ago.

Plummer organized the Camp
David Chapel Fund lnc., which
is seeking to raise $750,000 to $1
million from church people
throughout the country.

Plummer, of Chambersburg,
Pa., not far from Camp David, is

president of the National Lay
Leaders Association of the Unit-
ed Methodist Church and a
trustee of Wesley Theological
Seminary in Washington.

He first became acquainted
with the site when he was a Boy
Scout, and he started going there
on winter weekend outings. Th3
place then was simply Camp No.
3, under the jurisdiction of the
National Park Service.

In 1942, Camp No. 3 was
turned into a wartime retreat for
Roosevelt, who called it Shangri-
La. President Dwight D. Eisen-
hower renamed it Camp David
for his grandson.

As a builder, Plummer had
construction contracts with the
Navy, which runs the presidential
retreat.

”l have been up there quit@_
often over the years,” Plummer
said, although he said he could
not describe the work he did be-
cause of the tight security that sur-
rounds the camp.

President Lyndon B. Johnson
occasionally went to an Episcopal
church in nearby Thurmont, Md.,
and President Jimmy Carter used
the Camp David movie theater as
a makeshift chapel on Sundays.

”We obviously invited
whatever guests we had with us
that weekend and our own staff
members, plus members of the
military who were stationed at
Camp David permanently, to join
us in the services,” Carter said in
a 1985 interview.

Evans sizes up rest of Big East opponents

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

The Big East Conference season
is approaching the midway point,
and there have been some sur-
prising teams.

But as Pitt coach Paul Evans is
quick to point out, ”I still would
say the four teams I picked in the
top four [Syracuse, Georgetown,
St. John's and Pitt] are the top four
in the league.”

Regardless, there have been a
few noteworthy shakeups so far.
Such as:

0 Villanova was off to an eye-
opening 6-1 start before consecu-
tive losses to St. John's and Provi-

dence. The Wildcats were in

third place going into last night's
game against Georgetown.

°The Hoyas regrouped and
won three straight after ex-
periencing their worst start in
league history (1-3).

0 And, as always, there have
been some surprising upsets.
Boston College beat Georgetown
at Boston Garden. Connecticut
upset Syracuse at the Carrier
Dome. Villanova knocked off
Syracuse in the Spectrum. And
the beat goes on.

Evans thinks the most surpris-
ing — and disappointing — team
has been Seton Hall. ’’I thought
Seton Hall might challenge this

year.”

The Pirates lost at home last
week against Syracuse and St.
John's. Both games went down to
the wire.

No one can call Connecticut a
disappointment, but the Huskies
have lost some tough games.

Connecticut's league record is
2-6, but among those losses were:
a three-point loss at Pitt, a seven-
point loss in overtime at St. John's
and a one-point loss at George-

Women's swim teamdefeats West

By Kelly Witt
Staff Writer

The women's swim team
finished their season of dual
meets on Friday in West Virginia
by defeating the Mountaineers
145-119.

”West Virginia has good in-
dividual swimmers, but our depth
overwhelmed them. We out-
scored them in the events that
they won by taking second, third,
and even fourth places," said
head coach David Belowich.

Senior co—captain Marian Cas-
sidy won the 1,000—yard
freestyle, the first individual
event, and set the tone for the rest
of the meet.

Other winners included
Celeste Makiel in the 200-yard
freestyle, Cindy Rose in the
50-yard freestyle, Tricia Rickert in
the 500-yard freestyle and Judy
Haughton in the 200-yard but-
terfly.

’’It was a good effort all the way
around from our team,” said Be-
lowich. "There is definitelv such

a thing as home pool advantage.
We have to pull together as a
team to neutralize that as much
as possible,” he continued.

On Jan. 23rd, the women
defeated 20th—ranked Ohio State
at Trees pool, 157-113.

”It’s nice to knock off a top-20
team,” said Belowich.

Belowich was also happy to
see his seniors do well in their
last home meet of the regular
season.

Co—captains Cassidy and Rose
won the 200-yard backstroke and

town last Saturday.

”Now it gets to a point with Se-
ton Hall and Connecticut of how
much longer can you go on los-
ing one- and two-pointers and
losing at the end without the kids
giving up, thinking they can't win
anymore,” Evans said.

Providence no longer has Rick
Pitino, and that's made things
mighty difficult for his successor,
Gordie Chiesa. The Friars have a
9-9 overall record and are 3-4 in
the league. They’ve knocked off
Georgetown and Villanova at
home but got smothered at Pitt
and also lost on the road to
Boston College.

After last year's Final Four trip,

Despite tri-meet split

this season has been stormy for
Providence and Chiesa. Sopho-
more center Marty Conlon quit
the team three weeks ago, appar-
ently because of too much verbal
abuse in".‘practice, and sopho-
more guard Carlton Screen
missed much of the early season
with an ankle injury.

”I don't think anybody thought
they could come close to [the
success] of last year even if Rick
was there or God was there. Gor-
die’s got a lot of undue pressure,”
Evans said.

”There’s no way that team was
going to be a 20-game winner,
and Gordie may come close to

.The Women's Gymnastics
team hosted another tri-meet
Saturday night with the Universi-
ty of Rhode Island and Penn State
University.

The Lady Panthers scored a to-
tal of 176.45 ‘points, which easi-
ly defeated URI’s 171.80. Penn
State won the entire meet with a
score of 181.20. I

Pitt started out strong on their
first event, vaulting. Sophomores
Hope Celani and Shelly Sleith
received their highest vault scores
of the year with 8.55 (Celani),
and 9.0 (Sleith).

Freshman Kathy Wallish scored
8.8, followed by senior Cathy
Coleman's 8.9. Co-captain Kim
Calderone and junior Trish Aser
had the highest scores for Pitt on
vaulting; both received 9.15.

On the uneven parallel bars,
Celani was first in the lineup for
Pitt and hit her routine, scoring
8.25. Wallish also hit her routine
for an 8.55 Sleith, Coleman and
freshman Carrie Carnesale all had
some problems on this event.
Sleith and Coleman, who excel
on the unevens, had some minor
breaks in their rountines prevent-
ing them from scoring fairly high
as they usually ‘do.

Carnesale, who is hindered by
an ankle injury, moved very well
through her routine up until her
dismount. After landingher dis-

the 50-yard freestyle, respective-
ly. Haughton won the 200-yard
butterfly. Michelle Ranck swam
her lifetime best, and Cathy Sis-
tek dove well.

”It’s nice to see them go out in
-style,” said Belowich.

Sophomore Josette Prosser also
swam her lifetime best in the
200-yard breaststroke. ”I had
been trying to break a time of
2:40, and I swam a 2:37. I was
really happy with that,” said
Prosser.

Freshman Loran Bednar recent-
Iy qualified for the Eastern Sea-

mount, Carnesale fell back im-
mediately, grabbing her knee.
She was carried off the mat, and
fortunately didn't severely injure
her knee.

”I guess I was just favoring my
bad ankle and landed with
straight |egs,” said Carnesale.
Even though she fell at the end of
the routine, she still managed to
score very well, receiving an 8.7.
After Carnesale’s horrible fall,
another freshman, Jeannie Vec-

Achio, was next up for Pitt.
’’I felt very scared after I saw g
Carrie fall and then scream about

her knee,” said Vecchio, who has
suffered from bad knee injuries
throughout her gymnastics
career. ’’I was really worried
about Carrie, but I knew I had to

put everything out of my mind \

and just concentrate on my
routine.”

Concentration proved to be a
key factor in Vecchio’s perfor-
mance, as she hit a great routine
and won the event with a 9.15.

The next event for Pitt was the
balance beam. ”We’re still work-
ing very cautiously on beam,”
said coach Debbie Yohman.
However, being cautious kept the
Panthers on the beam in this
competition. Wallish started off
for Pitt and scored 8.45. Celani

scored 8.2. Calderone, Vecchio'

and Sleith were the high scorers
for Pitt with 8.9, 8.95 and 9.0,
respectively.

job all year," said Belowich.

The women's next meet will be
the Big East Championships held
here at Pitt in two weeks.

”Now we can swim Big East
with confidence," Belowich said.
”We’ve won it five years in a
row, and gone beyond what any
other team has done. We hope to
make it six.”

Yohman’s commenting on the
meet, said, ”It was really en-
couraging to look at the score
sheet and see that we were only
a point behind PSU on every
event,” she said. Although a
point is not that much in gymnas-
tics, trailing by a point or more on
each event does add up in the fi-
nal team totals. This was the case
with PSU.

”We really blew it on bars, and
that hurt us in the end,.”she said.

rina Cat Classic, which is the
most prominent invitational next
to the NCAA Nationals.

AP Sports Writer

SAN DIEGO — Doug Wil-
liams’ slice of Super Bowl histo-
ry has nothing to do with black
and white, except for the print in
the record book: 340 yards and
four touchdown passes.

No other quarterback, black or
white, ever did better.

Williams, the first black quar-
terback to start a Super Bowl,
drove the Washington Redskins
to a 42-10 rout of the Denver
Broncos Sunday night. All week,

Williams refused to make this a
matter of race, and he maintained
that posture after being named
the game's most valuable player.

”I didn't come here to be the
first quarterback to start a Super
Bowl,” Williams said. ”I just
want to be the quarterback of the
Washington Redskins.”

Washington Coach Joe Gibbs
echoed those feelings.

”Hopefully, we're at the point
now where most people were
looking at players, not colors
anymore.” ,

Williams wiped out any racial
considerations with a record-
breaking performance that
matched or broke marks estab-
lished by three of the greatest Su-
per Bowl quarterbacks in history.

The 340 yards broke the record
of 331 set by San Francisco's Joe
Montana in 1985. The four
touchdowns —- all in a remarka-
ble .second—period explosion -
tied the record of Pittsburgh's Ter-
ry Bradshaw in 1979.

And Williams touched off the
Washington powder keg with an
80-yard touchdown pass, tying
the record for longest pass set by
the Los Angeles Raiders’ Jim
Plunkett in 1981.

Between them, Bradshaw,
Montana and Plunkett own eight
Super Bowl rings.

Ironically, Williams got rolling
after leaving the game with an in-
jured left knee near the end of the
first quarter. He was replaced for
two plays by Jay Schroeder.

”On the sidelines, I felt I could
walk and set up,” Williams said.
”No matter what the pain, I was
going back in.”

Williams struggled through a
tough first quarter as Denver
jumped into a 10-0 lead.

”We were not getting a lot of
field position in the first quarter,”
Williams said. ”There [were]
some early drops, and they were
blitzing early. But I knew we
could come back.”

Williams remembered that the
Redskins had fallen behind 14-0
against Chicago in the first round
of ‘the playoffs and recovered to
win 21-17.

"I was confident,” he said.
”We knew things would eventu-
ally go our way, just like in Chica-
go, and they did.”

Williams said that he thought 8‘ ‘

the MVP award could have gone
to other Redskins, including run-
ning back Tim Smith, who set a
Super Bowl record with 204
yards rushing.

”It could easily have gone to
Tim or Ricky Sanders,” another
record—setter with 193 receiving
yards.

Williams said he thought that
the Redskins defense made a
major contribution by holding
Denver to a field goal when the
Broncos, leading 7-0, were in po-
sition to take a two-touchdown
lead in the first period.

Williams then hit Sanders with
an 80-yard touchdown pass ear-
ly in the second quarter.

PITTSBURGH (AP) - Vet-
eran Pittsburgh Steelers offen-
sive tackle Ray Pinney became
a free agent Monday after the
Steelers failed to offer him a
new contract, the team said.

Last season, Pinney, 33,
played in 11 games, starting
six, for the Steelers.

Pinney played seven sea-
sons for the Steelers before
jumping to the United States
Football League on Aug. 28,
1983. He re-signed with the
Steelers on Sept. 13, 1985.

For the Steelers, Pinney
played at left tackle, right tack-
le, guard and long snapper.

Pinney, from Seattle, played
for the University of Washing-
ton and was one of three Steel-
ers’ second-round draft
choices in 1976.

He played in Super Bowl.

Vanderbilt's upsets carrying club

By Skip Latt
AP Sports Writer

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — After im-
pressive victories over Kentucky
and Florida, Vanderbilt coach
C.M. Newton said Monday the
job before him now is to keep his
15th-ranked Commodores on an
even keel.

”The rankings, to me, are very
simply a recognition of doing
well. It's a recognition by out-
siders who look and say ‘Hey!
There's a basketball team that has
done well.’ If you continue to
win, they will continue to recog-
nize you. If you don't continue to
win, they won't recognize you,”
Newton said.

The Commodores, 13-4, as-
sured their first.appearance in
The Associated Press poll since
the 1978-79 season by following
last Wednesday's 83-66 thump-
ing of Kentucky with a 92-65 dis-
mantling of Florida on Saturday.

The losses dropped Kentucky,
ninth last week, to 10th this
week, while Florida, No. 14 last
week, fell all the way to 19th.

Staff Writer

The Pitt men's track team
turned in another strong perfor-
mance Sunday at the Princeton
Relays.

Capturing individu:_’a|g’gtit_l_es for
Pitt were Lee McRae7 in the

55—meter dash and George lfill in
the 55-meter hurdleslwhile two
Pitt relay teams emerged victori-
ous (the sprint medley relay and
the shuttle-hurdle relay).

McRae set a new meet record

in his victory, covering the

55—meters in 6.30 seconds. Zeke
Gadson finished sixth with a time
of 6.40.

lfill ran a 7.37 in winning the

I 55-meter hurdles. Finishing fifth

and sixth in the event were Cal-
vin Holmes (7.56) and Elbert El-
lis (7.58).
Both victorious relay teams
missed the Princeton Relays
record time in their event by a
mere 10th of a second. The sprint
medley relay team of Dave Price,
McRae, Rowan Mighty and Dave
Moore recorded a time of
3:25.16 in winning their event
while the shuttle-hurdle relay
team of Ellis, Eric Cannon, lfill
and Holmes emerged victorious
in running a 28.5.
The mile relay team of Moore,
Chop Burton, Holmes and Price
finished fourth in their event.

They covered the mile in
3 : I 9.2 3 .

For Pitt coach John Vasvary the
Princeton Relays were an essen-
tial experience for his Panthers.

”The IC4As [the Eastern cham-
pionships] are held at Princeton

",_;this;«y;ear,3and we wanted to get

theteam used to the track. Last
year the IC4A meet was held at
Harvard, which has a good track.
In contrast, the track at Princeton
is not all that good; it bounces
when you run on it,” said
V a s v a r y. »
As for his team's performance,
Vasvary was fairly pleased. ”We
had a real good meet.”

Nevada—Las Vegas jumped
from fourth to second with 1,094
points, while Brigham Young, the
only unbeaten major-college
team and holder of the longest
current winning streak at 15
games, moved from seventh to
third and landed the other No. 1
vote.

Duke, Temple, Purdue, Okla-

and a bevy of 3-point-shot marks-
men to stand 6-3 in the league,
good for a second-place tie with
Kentucky and one game behind
league-leading Florida.

”The turnaround really began
with our Georgia game and our
Alabama game [both victories] in
which we played very well,” said
Newton, who is in his 31st year
as a head coach and has com-
piled a 483-354 record during
stops at Transylvania, Alabama
and Vanderbilt.

Perdue’s inside power, which
accounted for 19 points and 15
rebounds against Florida, has
been complimented by the out-
side shooting of guards Barry Go-
heen, Ba-rry Booker, Derrick
Wilcox and Scott Draud and for-
ward Charles Mayes.

season, led a 3-point assault on
Kentucky by hitting six of nine
from 3-point range and has hit
49.3 percent, 34 of 69, from the
19-foot, 9-inch arc.

"Scott has been phenomenal
through all this. All our guards

have played well, but I think Scott '

has really come of age,” said
Newton, whose Commodores
are hitting’ 46.5 percent from
3-point range as a team.

”We determine in the presea-
son who our 3-point shooters are
going to be. We have no restric-
tions on the shot, except we don't
want a 3-point shot off our
primary break and in situations
dictated by time and score,”
Newton said.

Newton said there is no great
secret to Vanderbilt's success; it
has been a matter of maturity and
expenence. ’

The State of the Art of Caring

An Equal Opportunity Employer M/F

By John Labriola

For The Pitt News

The Pitt Hockey Club played a
doubleheader this past weekend,
going up against Slippery Rock
University and West Virginia
University. The Panthers skated
away with a I0-4 win over Slip-
pery Rock on Saturday and a 6-4
loss to West Virginia on Sunday.

In Saturday's game, the Pan-
thers dominateg_.,,,tQe, ice during
the-first two pel3‘ii3§'§ifi°Early in the
first. period, Rick Schlesinger
scored the first Panther goal of the
game. With the Panthers short-
handed, goaltender Chris Stude-
baker made a terrific save from a
shot by a Slippery Rock player.
The remainder of the first period
went without a goal for either
teams.

In the second period, the Pan-
thers were coming on strong with
goals scored by Greg Wer-
chowski, Brian Owens and Marc
Bowers, bringing the score up to
4-0 at the end of the second
period.

Two minutes into the third peri-
od, referee Randy Dunlap was
checked into the Slippery Rock
box by Panther defenseman Bill
McDade. McDade was pushed
by a Slippery Rock player. The
player forced McDade to fall into

the referee, sending Dunlap into
the bow. Five minutes later, Marc
Bowers scored the Panthers’ sixth
goal, giving him the hat trick.

*’’It felt pretty good,” said
Bowers.

With six minutes left in the
third period, Slippery Rock
scared to finally put the Rock on
the board, followed by two con-
secutive Panther goals by John
Carlins and Craig Clontz. Slip-
pery Rock followed up with two
goals of their own. The Panthers
retaliated with two more goals,
one from Bernie Antonio and the
other from Jim Jacobs.

Slippery’ Rock scored the last
goal of the night with 30 seconds
remaining in the game.

On Sunday, the Panthers
traveled down to Morgantown,
only to suffer a loss to the West
Virginia Mountaineers.

The first period started off with
three consecutive goals scored by
West Virginia. ”They put us into
a hole that we couldn't get out
of,” said Owens, the Panthers’
captain.

Craig Clontz scored the Pan-
thers’ first goal shortly before the
end of the first period. The Moun-
taineers scored the first goal of
the second period followed by a
Panther goal from Owens. West
Virginia scored again, but Clontz

came back with another Panther
goal in the second period to bring
the score within two goals.

In the third period, Paul Erduer
scored the Mountaineers’ final
goal of the game, while Owens
shot the Panthers’ final goal.

”The puck hit off of the goa|ie’s
left skate and went in,” said
Owens. ”We didn't come out hit-
ting, and our wingmen couldn't
get the puck out of our own
zone/’

Todd Raible, the club's presi-
dent, said, ”The team wasn't up
for this game. We'll have to be up
for this weekend because the
teams we're playing are better
than West Virginia.”

The Panthers’ next game will
be against No. I ranked Gannon
(West Penn College Hockey As-
sociation) at Lakevue on Satur-
day. Faceoff is 5:30 p.m.

”What we gotta do is probably
go to the offensive set of the
game. What we've gotta hope for
is for them to take a lot of penal-
ties because that's what they do,”
said Owens.

”Every time we play them, they
take a lot of penalties. We just
gotta capitalize on the power
plays. That's the way to do it.”

”When we played them the
last time, we sat on Greg Tim-
mons for the first period, and we
came out with a 3-0 lead. Then
we decided to go away from our
game plan, and we quit shadow-

that. They may win 16 or 17,” he
added.

To show how prevalent parity
and inconsistency have become
in the Big East, look no further
than the second-place St. John’s
Redmen.

Lou Carnesecca’s team lost to
PittJan. 9, and their league record
stood at 0-2. A little over three
weeks later, the Redmen are 5-2,
and a win over Pitt tomorrow
would give them sole possession
of first place.

”St. John's right now may have
the advantage [in the conference
race] because they got three road
wins against some pretty good
clubs. So they've got a schedule
factor that helps them,” Evans
said. .

E] El l:l

Boston College coach Jim
O'Brien is very impressed with
Pitt’s freshman backcourt of Sean
Miller and Jason Matthews. ’’I
think they’re very good players.
Matthews made some big shots
against us. Miller does a great job
just getting the ball over halfcourt
and getting them in their offense.
Miller has the luxury of being
able to play with extremely
talented inside guys.”

Cl E] El

Pitt is 15-2 overall, in first place
in the conference and ranked
ninth in the country by The As-
sociated Press. So is this team
right about where Paul Evans ex-

-pected it to be? ’’I don't know.

We may be better than I thought
without some of the kids I expect-
ed us/to have.” And the list of

players who didn't project aca-
demically is a big one. Pitt lost
Mike Goodson, Rod Brookin, Bri-
an Shorter, Marlon Ferguson and
Marvin Branch (who eventually
flunked out at Kansas) to academ-
ic woes.
E El D

Wasn't it just a short time ago
that Pitt’s foul shooting was bor-
dering on the atrocious? The

latest stats show different. in 17 ‘

games, the Panthers are hitting 71
percent of their free throws. In six
league games, Pitt is hitting at a
73.4 percent clip.

”Our foul shooting has gotten
better. Once again, it's a mental
thing. They're all capable of
shooting them. We shoot them
every night. It makes me laugh
that I get letters telling me to have
the kids shoot 50 [free throws] a
night. That would mean we'd
have to cut back 50,” Evans said.

Pitt's top foul shooters are: Mat-
thews (87 percent), Miller (82
percent), Demetreus Core (78
percent),/Charles Smith (77 per-
cent) and Bobby Martin (71
percent). 1

The only reason Pitt's team per-

. centage isn't higher is Jerome

Lane. The junior power forward
has shot the second highest num-
ber of foul shots on the team
(100) but has hit only 60.
However, Lane is shooting 68
percent in Big East games.

”There’s not a night Jerome
doesn't make 80 out of 100 in
practice. it was just a mental thing
because he was missing them. Af-
ter he got over that, he's been
pretty good,” Evanssaid.
