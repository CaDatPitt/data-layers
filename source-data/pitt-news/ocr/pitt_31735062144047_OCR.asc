Carmen Jones
All-Time Hit
To Be At Nixon

Carmen Jones, the play to be
presented at the Nixon theatre on
Monday evening, March 4, is one
that the critics have hailed “the
most thrilling footlight event of
the seas-on.”

Walter Winchell says, “It is su-
perlb entertainment——magniﬁc—ent-
ly performed.” Lewis Nichols of
the New York Times wrote, “It is
beautifully done in every way,
with gay colors and gay ballets
and singers who sing as though
they meant it. Just call it won-
derful, quite wonderful.”

From coast to coast the critics
have unanimously praised Oscar
I-Iammerstein’s brilliant adapta-
tion of the original opera, Hassard
-Sh0rt’s modern staging, and Billy
Rose’s presentation of an‘ inspired
Negro cast.

According to the critics, there
is no pretending that the para-
chute factory of Carmen Jones
isn’t a little dated in post-war
playgoing, but then Carmen Jones
was never in any danger of being
as timeless as Carmen. It is mere-
ly a ﬂashing darktown variation
on a fabulous theme, a good one,
‘done with skill and high spirits, in
a setting of brilliant and amusin-g
costumes.

Although Carmen Jones is an
Americanized version of Carmen,
there is no distortion o-f its oper-
atic quality. If it has the appeal
of musical -comedy it is because its
communication is swiﬂt, its pace
fast. There is not a song, a dance
number, or a specialty that isn’t
an integral part of the action.

‘Muriel ‘Smith (who alternates in
the title role with Inez Matthews)
looks, plays, and sings the part
with great realism.

Producers will have a hard time
ﬁnding another play to equal Car-
men Jones. It is one of the all-
time greats

Tickets for the Nixon beneﬁt
show will go on sale the week
of February 11 from the ground
ﬂoor booth.

Pitt Women Will Write Climax
To Fifty-Year Success Story

Fifty years have been completed
in the Pitt women’s success story.
This year we have reached the
climax. We Pitt women, as co-
authors of this story, now have
a chance to make the climax a
success.

The ‘central theme: 1300 women
students of Pitt have undertaken
to complete an unﬁnished floor in
the Cathedral of Learning.

The introductory chapters are
top heavy with success. There is
just one link missing—student co-
operation and interest. We are
capable of supplying them!

Chapter 1. The ﬁftieth anniver-
sary of women at Pitt is being
celebrated as direct proof to our-
selves that we have matured, de-
veloped, and progressed. The ad-

Twelfth Floor Dream Materializes;

Braun Room Already Finished

The Twelfth ﬂoor is no longer
just a dream. It is quickly becom-
ing a reality. One room, the
Braun room, already ﬁnished and
furnished, will be used as a small
conference and tea room.

When the whole ﬂoor is com-
pleted this is what it will be like.
There will be two large rooms,
the Thyrsa W. Amos Memorial
room and the Pine play room. The
Memorial room, to be furnished in
the Georgian period, will have an
open :ﬁre place, a snack bar, card
tables, and ping-pong tables. A
floor for -dancing, as well as music
an-d records, has been provided.

Between the two large rooms
will be a kitchen to serve teas and
parties in the Memorial rooms, or
informal parties, lunches, and
suppers in the Pine room.

To the right and left of the com-
pleted Braun room there will be
small rooms for relaxation, com-

 ‘plate, with chaise lounges, com-

fortable chairs-,_ and magazines- In
these rooms and in theacheck room

 

and corridors, the plastering has
already been completed.

Directly off one of the two rest
rooms on the ﬂoor will be a dress-
ing and shower room.

Activitiesheadquarters will take
over one wing. In this wing will
be located a workroom for mime-
ograph machines, poster tables,
work tables, and benches. In ad-
dition there will be ﬁle rooms to
be used by student organizations,
three small conference rooms for
committee meetings, an office for
one of the assistants to the dean
of women, and the YWCA ofﬁce.

From -one of the relaxation
rooms a stairway will lead down
to the roof deck which will be
used as a sun porch d-uring the
warm months.

Necessary storage space willbe
provided ‘by building ﬂoors in the
two unused elevator shafts. It
will -be convenient for storing card
tables not in use, chairs, and any
rugs that have lobe rolled up for
dancing. . .' g 

   

 

 

ministration has granted the
women of the University an op-
portunity to commemorate this
day and to further the work of
the twelfth floor by sponsoring a
beneﬁt performance at the Nixon
theatre. Never before in the his-
tory of Pitt women have we been
considered capable of undertaking
a project of this scope. We have
been given the -opportunity. Our
leaders have faith in us! We
shan’t disillusion them. Student
cooperation and interest will de-
termine the success.

Chapter two discloses our suc-
cess further. Through the assist-
ance of Pitt alumnae and other
patrons, the twelfth ﬂoor has be.-
come a tangible project. We have
waited long enough to show our
appreciation. The Nixon beneﬁt is
our chance to prove worthy of
these liberal contributions, and we
are determined to take advantage
of it. NO, buying a dollar-ten
ticket won’t assure success. We
have a deeper motive than just

Faculty Works
With Students

Faculty members are helping
Pitt women to make the Nixon
beneﬁt a success. They have been
working in various capacities.

Miss Helen Rush, dean of wom-
en, provides the spirit for the
project. She says, “The twelfth
floor has been and can be again
the center of life for women at
Pitt. As the women work together
to ﬁnish the twelfth ﬂoor, they can
create a spirit which will keynote
the building of the ﬂoor and dom-
inate all of its activities.” '

Dr. Asher Isaacs, associate pro-
fessor of economics, has been
working with the students as
ﬁnancial advisor. At the Women’s
assembly, January 4, he will tell

‘the women how toclear ads. Dr.

We are determined to prove to
our community that we want a
twelfth ﬂoor and that we are ca-
pable of getting what we want.
NO, we are not asked to give
merely money. Instead, we have
the opportunity we’ve wanted—
that of producing directly for the
twelfth ﬂoor. We have the chance
to display our intelligence and
personality and to exert a liberal
amount of energy. As the prime,

It’s up to us!

supplies spirit

Isaacs feels, “The ﬁftieth anniver-
sary of women at Pitt represents
a milestone in education. Inas-
much as this production comes
while we are celebrating this an-

the idea originated. We owe this

sity. They will sell tickets, they
will compile the program, and
they will usher at the show. All

ters will be taken care of by

all-out effort to earn money for

the twelfth ﬂoor, a place that for .

years has been but a dream, but
now is fast becoming a reality.
