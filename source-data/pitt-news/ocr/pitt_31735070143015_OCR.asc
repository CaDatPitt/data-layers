College students who can’t afford
the cost of studying abroad might
soon receive ﬁnancial assistance
from Washington if lawmakers pass
the Sen. Paul "Simon Study Abroad
Foundation Act.

The act, which is part of the For-
eign Relations Authonzation Act for
ﬁscal years 2010 and 2011, was in-
troduced to Congress last Thursday
by‘Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee.

If made into law, the bill will cre-
ate a program dedicated to sending

New bill could make study abroad affordable

1 million undergraduate students
per year to study abroad through

‘grants to students and improvements

to existing study abroad assistance
programs.

Despite surveys that sayimore
than 50 percent of undergradu-

ate students want to study abroad,-

only 2.15‘ percent of Pennsylvania
undergraduates studied abroad in

the 200607 academic year, slightly‘

higher than the national average of
1.36 percent.

Pitt’s Study Abroad Ofﬁce sends
approximately 1,300 students to

study abroad every year, even though _

Carol Larson, the ofﬁce’s director of

management, said she would like to
send more.

“In theory, study abroad is a won-
derful thing and most people want to
do it,” Larson said. “But when you
get down to the nitty—gritty details, it
can be a very expensive semester or
year for a student to pay for.”

Larson said she’s excitedly wait-
ing to hear the details of the Simon
Act because anything that makes the
cost of study abroad less prohibitive
would be a blessing to students.

’ But she also said she knows Con-
gress has tiied to pass legislation like
this for years, and she doesn’t hold
any grand delusions.

‘‘I think of this in really theoreti-
cal terms,” she said. “We don’t know
where it’s going yet, or what ﬁnal
form it will take, or how much the
funding is really going to be.”

The Simon Act is now moving
through the House Foreign Affairs
Committee and has yet to move
through the House Committee on
Appropriations. ‘

This means Congress has only

. given targeted numbers for how

much it might spend for the Simon
Act, so it’s impossible to tell how
much money, if any,  go toward
the act. '

The current projection is that it

Business adjust to  
Oakland sans students

by Jamar Thrasher A
Staff Wrzler

Localbusinessownersaretryingtocatertoa
larger audience now that two-thirds of their stu-
dent clientele have left the city for the summer.

 Petropoulos, the executive director l

of the Oakland Business Improvement District,
said it’s hard to tell how the exodus of students
will affect businesses. They should be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis, she said.

“Some businesses that have a  student-
customer base know to anticipate a dro ” Petro-
poulos said. "They may use the summer time
to conduct inventory, renovations, etc. Other
businesses‘ do not see a drop butvmay see an
increase if they have a more employee-based
clientele.” _ i

Restaurants, bookstores and clothing stores,
she said, tend to cater more toward students than
to other clientele

Aaron Price, owner of Sorrento’s Pizza on
Atwood Street, said his business can’t rely solely
on student customers.

Last summer, 10,345 full-time and part—time
undergraduate and graduate students took classes
at Pitt, compared to 27,562 students in the fall.

“The  about Oakland is that you want
to acquire as much nonstudent business [as you
‘can],” Ptice said. "I'hat.’s the stable business”

Price said his restaurantwill continue offering
select discounts on food, like its $5-pizza deal,
which is popular among college students

John Hoenig, manager of Ptimanti Bros, said
that dunng PittStart sessions, future students and
their families visit the restaurant, but ultimately,
“a lot of it depends on graduation.”

Hoenig did recognize a change in student
traffic, but hasn’t had to make any business deci-
sions based on this. '

“I don’t anticipate a major change?’ Hoenig

Simon Act to focus on disadvantaged, minority students

Simon Act, page 1

will cost approximately $40 million in the fiscal
year 2010, then $80 million in 2011 and every
following year.

A spokesperson at Berman’s office, Lynne
\X/eil, said she thinks the Foreign Relations Act
has a good chance of passing through com-
mittee and the House of the Representatives,
but might stall in the Senate.

Even if Congress votes down the Foreign
Relations Act, she said, lawmakers can vote
on the Simon Act alone, which might: help its
chances of becoming law.

Weather

said.

There are also more natural factors that
businesses can use to attract existing and new
customers. '

Petropoulos said nice weather brings more
outside customers to Oakland, despite the lower
number of students.

W/eather has less effect on other businesses
— even those with University ties.

Maggie & Stella’s Cards& Gifts, a University-
owned shop named after the ﬁrst female Pitt
graduates, may shorten its hours during the sum-
mer, along with  other changes.

Monica  the store manager, said
the shop might be “losing the opportunity” of
not laying off student workers. This will depend
on consumer traffic in the summer During the
school year, business traffic peaks during holidays
like Christmas and Valentine’s Day.

Businesses like the 24-hour Rite Aid on At-

wood Street cater to a more diverse consumer. A

base.

Store assistant manager Matthew Snyder said
Rite Aid’s large selection and convenience allow
it to remain stable during the summer

“We have a pretty decent mix of students,”
Snyder said. '

With some student employees leaving in the
summer, Snyder said Rite Aid doesn’t have to
lay off workers

he said.

    

“\X/'e'would have to cut down on payroll,” .

Lastjune, the House passed the Simon Act,
but the Senate didn’t get to vote on it before
Congress went to recess.

If passed, the Simon Act will function
much like current grant—giving programs, such
as the Fulbright Scholars Program.

It will establish the Senator Paul Simon
Study Abroad Foundation, which will be re-
sponsible for allocating funds to undergraduate
students who apply for assistance through their
school’s study abroad offices. M

Students will receive ﬁnancial assistance

based on demonstrated need and scholastic

‘H1611-t. The assistance will focus on helping

economically disadvantaged students, with a
special emphasis on minority involvement.

One of the missions of the Simon Act is to
send students to nontraditional countries, like
the People’s Republic of China and countries
in the Middle East.

More than half of students who study
abroad do so in Europe, but the Simon Act
seeks to encourage knowledge and understand-
ing of a broader variety of cultures.

Even if Congress votes
down the Foreign Relations
Act, lawmakers can vote on
the Simon Act alone, which

might help its chances of
becoming law.

When Grove City College adminis-

until the fall 2010 semester. According
to Gechter,_a molecular biology major,
he only needed two more courses to
graduate, and would have completed
them by the end of the summer.

Grove City is a private Christian
’ institution, and therefore it can legally
discriminate against behavior it consid-
ers undesirable or immoral. Gechter
admitted that he knowingly breached
the student code of conduct. But the
colleges action shows a cold lack of
mercy, and the punishment seems dis-
proportionately harsh.

Private colleges enjoy the abil-
ity to govern students using suicter

 regulations than allowed at public uni-
5 versities Grove City, though, drafted

l . . . . .
 some questionable prohibitions 11’ltO

E The Crimson, its student handbook
j containing the standards of conduct
5 requirements Among other invasive
j and overreaching policies, it advises
 against men loitering near the one
 area in which women can sunbathe. It
 prohibits skateboards, considers stu-
 dents sharing an offeampus bedroom
 with the opposite sex an “especially
 serious” offense and requires an open
 door when members of the opposite
 sex visit students’ on—campus apart-
 ments V

3 The Princeton Review ranked
l Grove City College the second-
 most socially conservative college in
 the United States, between Brigham
j Young University and the University
 of Dallas. If Gechter didn’t know
 this speciﬁc information, he at least
i knew that Grove City prohibits “sexual
j misconduct including premarital sex
j (heterosexual or homosexual) or any
 other such conduct thatviolates historic
E Christian standards”

{ Yet, this sits on a list with other vio-
 lations such as food fights and 
 ﬁrecrackers, for which the punishment
2 described is disciplinary probation, a
; minimum $50 ﬁne and a suspension

j of one week or longer: A separate list

EDITORIAL

 Private school's
regulations:

legal but dubious

threatens longer suspension or dismiss-
al for more serious infractions, like steal-
ing and possessing ﬁrearms Gechter’s
suspension lasts more than one year
 an appeals process, and the
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette reported that
Grove City denied his  appeal.

Considering Gechter traveled out
of state to film the adult movies, used
a pseudonym and never revealed his
involvement to anyone at the school,
the punishment seems callous How
far is a college justified in  to
regulate a student’s legal behavior be-
yond university grounds? Furthermore,
what happened to the students who
viewed and spread the pornography
to other students, thus alerting the ad-
ministrators to the situation? Werethey
punished at all? The code of conduct
equally forbids those deeds

Unfortunately, these and other
questions go unanswered, as the college
refuses to comment on the complex
issue beyond two paltry official state-
ments, of which the  explanation
is only 61 words

Some who agree with Grove Citjfs
decision might say, ‘just don’t go there,”
but stagnating incomes and skyrocket-
ing tuition restiict students’ collegiate
options more and more every year.

Gechter said he decided to attend
Grove City because of the ﬁnancial aid
offers and only ﬁlmed pornography to
pay tuition costs After getting “burned
out” constantly  lower—wage
jobs while attending school, he found
more lucrative weekend occupations,
like modeling and, eventually, pornog-
raphy. He said he needed the income
to pay the school, according to The
Sharon Herald.

If Grove City ﬁnds Gechter’s expla-
nation inexcusable, it should refund his
money. If the college bars him to proﬁt
from a legal profession it considers im-
moral, Grove City appears hypocritical
in keeping that money it considers so
irredeernably tainted. But, if Grove
City truly cares about its students, it

Obama obstructs republican process

Republican government is exer-

the government acts in the name of
U.S. citizens, with our direction and
electoral permission, we bear the
responsibility for the government’s
actions.

But this responsibility can only ,

be founded on government trans-
parency and the informed consent
of the citizenry. When governments
shroud their actions in secrecy, they
transgress against the social con-

the world.

For this reason, President Barack
Obama’s recent refusal to release
photos documenting the torture

‘State secrecy’ not traditional American value

Howard, page 6

made in the name of our safety at
the highest levels of government.
The American people deserve to see
exactly what was done to protect
them, for we are all complicit in
this abuse.

But despite the ruling of two
federal courts and the protnises
made by candidate Obama, Presi-
dent Obama will not release the
photos, thus keeping the American
people in the dark.

Why?

He tells us he will not release
the photos because they could pro-
voke more attacks on U.S. troops in
Afghanistan and Iraq as well as a
surge in anti-Americanism around

Dear Pitt News,

the world.

There are some problems with
Obama’s justifications.

First, Muslim terrorists attacked
the United States on Sept. 11 -
long before Abu Ghraib happened.
They attacked us not precisely be-
cause they “hate our freedoms,” as
former President George W Bush

claimed, but‘becau_se_the modern. .

world is encroaching on their tribal
backwaters. I

Second, a certain amount of
anti-Americanism is bound to occur
when the United States tortures and
abuses prisoners. It might have won
us some street cred with the Saudis,
but torture is one of those

--—— Letterstotheeditor  

I am  in response to Shane Levfs column “Grand Old Party must embrace centrist view-
points or die.” Wfith the Republican Party no longer in the Wltite House and majority of Congress,
it’s so easy to point ﬁngers exclusively in the GOP7s direction. But remember, it was only ﬁve years
ago in the 2004 election that the Republicans won handily in the White House and Congress.

, So what could have changed so dramatically in just five years to let the Democrats take over
Washington? Well, it was nothing the Democratic Party really did better, so much as what th-e Re-
publican Party did wrong. More speciﬁcally, George W Bush did not govern as a true Republican
president and left the Republican Party in shambles because of a failing economy and failing war.

But Bush is not the president anymore, and Americans will soon forget his missteps. When a
single party has absolute rule, as the Democrats do now and as the Republicans did ﬁve years ago,
the majority party will take almost all the blame when  go south, and the opposition party
will start  more elections. Eventually, the economy or something else has to go south in a
major way. Rest assured, the Democrats will get the major part of the blame, fair or not. This is
why government is highly cyclical.

As with almost any competition in life — especially sports and politics — the loser will often
get all the blame, and the winner will get all of the accolades for doing everything right —— even
when the outcome was extremely close. So just give it a few years. The Republicans will be back in
control of both the White House and Congress before you know it, and the Democrats will 
be the “party of no” as they were under W.’s years.

that tends to alienate a country from
the civilized world.

I’d like to know what Obama
thinks Americans value, because
state secrecy isn’t on my list. That’s
one of the things better left to
thugs and despots rather than the

elected’ leaders of a republic. Per-

haps Obama needs a reminder, but

the ‘citizens of a republic are not‘ A-
A A sheep to be herded. Deliberate ob-

fuscation constitutes a transgression
against the values of the men who
founded this nation as well as the
public agreement that has allowed
this country to function for more
than two centuries.

The American people have to

see these pictures so they can accept
responsibility for what was done
on their behalf and then make an
informed decision on such abuses.
The talking heads from the left and
right who defend the use of water-
boarding and other tortures are only
able to make their case because the
American people haven’t seen the

- gruesome details ‘oflwhat was being

done.

Although many people have
made this an issue about Obama
“lying” while on the campaign trail,
I expected change from his transi-
tion to the presidency and I would
have worried had it not occurred.

But what does" worry me is that

Obama has revealed himself as
comfortable with keeping evidence
of malfeasance from the Ameri-
can people. We aren’t talking about
troop movements or classiﬁed intel-
ligence, but about a crime that took
place and must be fully exposed
before we can move on as a na-

‘ tton.

‘Failure to examine thiscrime
honestly and transparently would
constitute an indelible stain on the
early days of the Obama presidency.
For his sake and the sake of the
republic, I hope Obama will rethink
the issue and release the photos.

To the Editor,

As the manager of the Pitt Student Health Service Pharmacy, I feel compelled to
respond to the editoiial “OCC: the Overly Capitalized Curriculum.”

At Pitt Student Health Service, we take pride in helping our students navigate their
independence in the area of health care. Our pharmacists always take great care to thor-
oughly review the students’ medications and to carefully discuss any complications or
contraindications they might encounter when  a particular medication.

Visiting the pharmacy also affords students the ability to ask any questions in an environ-
ment that caters specifically to Pitt students. For many students, coming to college is the
first time they take control of their own health care. Many have no idea there is a difference
between a medical, prescription, dental and vision insurance card. Our pharmacists and
pharmacy staff take the time to educate our students on this process and how it works.
In fact, the typical response from students is, “My parents usually take care of it.”

It is my View that offering OCC credit for a visit to the Pitt Student Health Service
Pharmacy is appropriate. If the function of the OCC is to help students cultivate the
knowledge, skills and experience to succeed after college, then participating in an experience
that helps students learn how to independently manage their own health care certainly ﬁts
that charge. Not all OCC requirements have to demand a signiﬁcant amount of time or

effort to be meaningful

Dead Rock West bandmates Frank Lee Drennen and Cindy Wasserman will put on a show and enjoy Pittsburgh weather today.

Calif. band proves West Coast rock still alive

by Sarah Simkin
Staﬂ Wrder

Rock isn’t dead.

Not on the East Coast and cer-
tainly not on the West, according to
Cindy Wasserman and Frank Lee
Drennen. They’ll prove it when
their band, Dead Rock West, plays
at the Thunderbird Cafe today.

jVocalist and guitarist Drennen
created the band name after read-
ing an article in Spin magazine
claiming that rock is dead on the
West Coast. s

“We thought that’d be a, great
name for a West Coast rock band,
like a middle ﬁnger saying that rock
is alive and well,” lead vocalist Was-
serman said.

Although a native of Los An-
geles, Wasserman is no stranger
to the Steel City, having toured in
Pittsburgh several times before.

“I’m happy that we’ll have a
day off in Pittsburgh. I’ve never

’ gotten to explore the city much,”

she said.

Dead Rock West has previously
toured with John Doe, Wilco, The
Knitters and Mark Olson. Roger
Clyne and the Peacemakers will
accompany the band at the Pitts-
burgh show. i

Wasserman said she deﬁnes a
great concert by “the energy of the
audience. If I feel like we’re really
connecting with them, that’s what
makes it explosive for me. It’s like
a back and forth of the energy, and
it’s really. neat.”

Wasserman acknowledged that
her bandmates might say some-

i thing different, but to her, Dead
C Rock West’s style is best described

as “Johnny Cash meets Tom Petty.
We know how to rock [as a band],

but we also love to play stripped
down as a duo.” _

Dead Rock West formed as a
ﬁve-piece band in 2006 and made
its first record, Hongl and Salt, in
2007.

Because all of the members also
tour with other bands, Dead Rock
West tours in various conﬁgura-
tions, sometimes as a duo act with
just Wasserman and Drennen. This
summer, the duo will play as a full
band.

“We take the same songs and
adapt them. Sometimes with a
band, we focus more on our rock-
ingu kinds of songs, and when we
have a conﬁgurations that’s more
stripped down, we focus on other
songs,” she said. “But the core

‘songs say the same, give or take.”

Wasserman elaborated on why
the Californians decided to in-

corporate a distinctively country

southern twang into their music.
.“The country flavor just comes

from all of us just growing up lis— _

tening to that kind of music, and
it got infused into our rock ’n’ roll
music,” she said.

She also cited the band X, old

Wanted: the next summer anthem

by Kieran Layton
A c9’E Editor

Has summer already come and
gone?

At the start of every summer,
as the world regains some color
and flip—ﬂops are once again an
acceptable foot fashion choice, my
pop culture radar grows warm and
fuzzy, excited at the prospect of
absorbing all of the annual sum-
mer entertainment staples -—— the
summer movie blockbusters’,
awesome summer concerts at the
Post—Gazette Pavilion and those
eccentric summer television series
that I never actually like.

And of course, above all, the
summer anthem.

The summer anthem, also
known as “The Song of the Sum-
mer,” is the song that becomes
aggravatingly ingrained in the lis-
tener’s head andis a pop radio sta-
tion staple well into September.

It is almost always a pop song
or some derivative of pop, like the
club—banging rap song.

And it is one of my favorite

items of pop culture to monitor
while ﬂoating in a pool or driv-
ing fast with the windows down,
screaming the lyrics —— yes, I am
that person on the road.

While mid-May has become the
breeding ground for smash sum-
mer singles, my radar this year has

been fairly mild, and it’s making me
nervous. I can think of countless
pop songs that lack any musical
merit — but that I still adore --
that were released during‘ the past’
few months but already on the
downward trek on the overplayed
curve. ‘

In the past few years,‘ summer
anthems have included Rihanna’s
“Umbrella” (Ella, ella), Timbal—
and’s grammatically infuriating
‘-‘The Way I Are,” Lil Wayne’s Blow
Pop-supporting “Lollipop” and

last year’s ode to bi—curiosity, Katy‘

Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl.”

These songs  conform to a
danceable beat, with hooks that not
even the most skilled ﬁsherman
could extract from the .listener’s
head.

The words are attractive be-
cause they’re fun to sing, but they
don’t bother with such pithy lyrical
attributes such as insightfulness or
Wlt. .

“Lick, lick, lick, lick it like a 101-‘ I

lipop,” —-- not quite Hemingway.
“I kissed a girl and I liked it. The
taste of her cherry Chapstick,” -
holy sentence" fragment, Batman!
Still, every summer, the nation
and I ingest these morsels of purely
mindless entertainment and crank
up the volumes on our stereos

.of uber-talented youth poised to

take the primetime ratings crown.

No offense to Zac Efron, but
Fox’s “Glee,” which premiered
after “American.Idol” last night,

is the most exuberant display of _

energy, wit and ﬂat-out joy to grace
the airwaves in quite some time.

Frankly, there has never been
a show like it, let alone one that
succeeds so greatly.

Focusing on the high school
social stigma that is glee club, the
show molds its characters into
stereotypes that never feel exag-
gerated or forced.

these are people the audience has
encountered in reality, whether in
high school or the “real world.”
Spanish teacher Wﬂl Schuester
(Matthew Morrison, Broadway’s

attempting to resurrect the failing
club of social misﬁts who not only
love to burst out in song, but long
to feel “part of something special,”

because in their minds, thatwould '

make ‘them special.

Ingenue Rachel (Lea Michele, ’

“Spring Awakening”) is talented
but shunned, and the jock with a
voice of gold, Finn (Cory Mon-
teith), ﬁnds himself going against

the social herd and upsetting the

clique balance at their suburban
Ohio high school.

acters — mainly actors hailing
directly from the stage, but “Ugly

But this year, there have already been ‘

countless tracks that ﬁt the Summer An-

already on the their way out in the national
pop consciousness, leaving a void.

Flo Rida’s “Right Round” sounded goofy

A enough to become an anthem, but people are

already groaning at its repetitive “Dead or

that will explode in a more anthem-worthy

Track and Field

Pitt Women earn 10th

place finish last weekend

by Alex Oltmanns
Staﬂ Writer

The Pitt track team had a
strong showing at the IC4A/
ECAC Championships in Princ—
eton, N.]., this past weekend, as
the event marked the end of the
season for some Panthers.

The Panther women had a bet-
ter showing than the men, with
several top—1O ﬁnishes, earning
them a 10th place ﬁnish overall.

On the track, freshman Cam-
brya Jones’ 23.81 seconds in the
200—meter dash was good for a
second—place ﬁnish. She placed
sixth in the 100—meter dash with
a time of 12.06 seconds.

Senior Mycaiah Clemons ran
the 100—meter hurdles in 14.25

seconds, which helped her earn
ﬁfth place. Clemons had already
qualiﬁed for NCAA Regionals in
the event but showed no signs of
taking the ECAC meet lightly.

In the ﬁeld, seniorjanessa Mur-

phy ﬁnished second in the long
jump with a mark of 6.02 meters.

-She also jumped 11.47 meters in

the triple jump, good enough for
25th place.

Sophomore Anita James also
had a great showing in the long
jump, ﬁnishing close behind Mur-
phy in seventh with a mark of 5.79
meters.

For the men’s team, sprinter
Antony Hobwana had already
qualiﬁed for Regionals in the
100—meter, but the ﬁeld athletes
had the best performance. Fresh-
man Ijelu Folarin took sixth in the
triple jump with a distance of 14.99
meters.

Senior Matt Raquet came in
12th in the javelin, while sopho-
more Garret Larkin ﬁnished 15th
in the shot put with a toss of 15.75
meters.

Next up for the Panthers is the
NCAA East Regional Tournament
May 29-30 in Greensboro, N.C.

However, he knows and respects
the fact that every member of our
team must be accountable for their
actions.”

Gunn’s preliminary hearing was
originally scheduled for May 14, but
was rescheduled for May 21.

Gunn was a ﬁfth-year senior last
season. He was injured in the ﬁrst
game against Bowling Green, butwas
awarded a sixth year of eligibility. His
59 tackles in 2007 were the third best
on the team.

He graduated in 2008 with a degree
in communication and rhetoric and is
currently enrolled in Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs.

Gunn is the fourth football player
to run into trouble during the past

a month. Receiver T.]. Porter and de-

fensive lineman Tommie Duhart were
suspended from the team last month
and announced that they would trans-
fer from Pitt. Sophomore receiver
Jonathan Baldwin was arrested April
19, but no disciplinary action by the
football has taken place.

Linebacker Adam.Gunn was awarded a sixth year of eligibility for next
season, but an off-ﬁeld incident has resulted in a suspension from the team.
