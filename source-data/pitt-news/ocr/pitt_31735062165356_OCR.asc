 i Like Dogs and Music

By CAROLYN STASENKO

Student writers for this year’s “Manuscripts” magazine
whose outside interests range from music to dogs admit to
an avid common love of writing.

The magazine, published annually by the English De-
partment under theeditorship of Dr. Edwin L. Peterson, is
a compilation of short stories by students, most of whom are

English majors.

According to Dr. Peterson, the
magazine originated 11 years ago,
with the writing majors depart-
«fnent and the Writer’s Conference.
Since then it has been published
each year to ..  A " .

   
   

the Writers
Conference,
which is usu-

ally held in
April. "

T h i s year’s
Writers a r e:
P a u 1 Nescot,

Riley, Col. ’56; . _A
A n‘-n Martin, Petergon
Col; 57; and

ate 'of -Yale University who has
studied in Dr. Peterson’s class for
two‘ years. Two other graduate
Writers are Lois Josephs and Dex-

 importance

“next to my husband, I like
writing best.” Lloyd Krupp, also
interested in music and inter-
pretive dance, has studied under
Dr. Peterson for two years. .
Recipient of the Owens Fel-
lowship, Paul Nescott will begin
work on his _master’s degree next
September. Carol Riley’s plans
are not quite so-deﬁnite, except
for a “long rest in Florida.”
Pen Name Used
Jerome Myers, whose anony-
mous Spanish name, 'Jaimez,
matches the mood of his.bull-
ﬁghting story, “Suerte de Matar,”
chooses his six Great Danes as
his .main interest next to writing.
He has written one novel, “Blue
Jungle,” and is now working on
his _second one. .

Dr. Peterson emphasized the
of the magazine
when he stated, “Literary agents
have told me that this is the only
student magazine outside of the
one put _out by Stanford that
they even look at. Many stories.
published in Manuscripts have
been picked out and reprinted in
commercial magazines.” ' .

This high quality of writing

Dr. Peterson attributes to- the fact.

that the magazine comes out only
once a year. He admits that he
has been requested to publish
several issues throughout the
year, but has refused because
“by bringing it out only once a
year, I can be sure of quality.”
Contribution, An Honor ,
-1 Its effect on the students, he

' says, is stimulating. “All vie for a

spot in it. It’s considered a real
honor for them.”
Dr. Peterson also called.atten-

. tion to the fact that the students
‘ of writing at the University have

had stories published in almost
every well-known magazine in
the country, a record of which

i A_ few other schools can boast.

Iwow: HOW'3 ‘H’ CHOW TODAY?”

*1.‘ V

 Grmling Activity

1, d On many occasions this TapDay, students who hada
' considerable number ofactivities ‘near their names were
not tapped to honoraries, while those with relatively few
were relatively surprised that they were chosen as out-
standing personalities in the activity area.

More than likely, members of organizations tapping
‘Y-‘found greater appeal for those people who had taken on
A -a. few activities and‘ done them well than for those whose

key chains weighted them down so’that they couldn’t take
time’ to lift a ﬁnger to do a really outstanding job in any
' singular interest. ,

" A problem presents itself, however, when one limits
himself‘ in the numberof activities he accepts. He must
choose -those that will most beneﬁt him, either profession-
ally or culturally. The student must weigh his extra-cur-
ricular. activities so that they become vital to his academic
responsibilities, and, thus, co-curricular. A
_ Of course any" activity that provides relaxation from
daily routine also is important and must be considered. But
students in all cases should accept those programs which

  
   
 
 

‘_ they’d enjoy participating in once out of the college arena,

Careful selection is imperative an.d the need is appar-

ent forlcounselors from among the faculty or administra-

tion who can guide a student toward those activities which
will prove most beneﬁcial. . . .

This does not mean that a point ‘system be set up by
the Dean of Men’s office to mechanically prohibit widespread

V _ Eajticipation. Administration inadvertently provides loop-
‘ es.

_ ‘Neither should entering freshmen be shunted into small
activity groups for the purpose of discovering whether they
are-suited for particular ﬁelds. This is not counseling. This

,  is regimentation. ‘ - . .

It is for the student, himself, to determine whether he
is capable and able to assume activities and to accept pre-
ferably co-curricular responsibilities rather than extra du-
ties. Yet he must be provided these out-of-classroom con-
cepts at the same time,he is informed of class responsibility.

 Only when trained counselors approach the student
from both aspects of his college life will he be able to

 choose successfully—expensive keys are insigniﬁcantf” ef-
. ' fort‘ expended is always beneﬁcial. /'

Acoustics Detract From:

Real Shakespeare

.By Barbara Cherington

Between swishing th rou gh
Gothic archways and springing
into niches in balconies, the Brit-
ish Haileybury ipplayers seemed
right at home.in the Commons
they performed

Room where
‘ ‘ M a c b eth”
last F r i d a y
night and Sat-

The p l a y -
ers.. eighteen
years old and
younger, per-
formed a m i d

‘S h a kespear-
ean s e t t in g,
with a low
stage project-
ed out into the audience.

There , was no curtain—mere-
ly a member of the cast calling
out ends of acts as players were
seen rushing to various Nation-
ality Rooms used as dressing
rooms for the occasion.

Macbeth Masters CR

Of the thirty young actors and
actresses who are traveling
through the world with this pro-
duction, the master of the Com-
mons Room last week-end was
Greatorex, v. h o

Mrs.4Molly Matthews, as Lady
Macbeth, made a half successful

, attempt to overcome the poor

acoustics. of the Commons Room.

However, the other players didn’t

come through strongly at all.
Costumes were skillfully de-

signed by the female lead Molly

Matthews who, with Carola Mat-
thews as Lady Macduff, are wife
and daughter of the producer, re-
spectively.
Show Annual Production
Since Haileybury’s perform-
ance of “Hamlet” in 1926,
Shakespearean plays have be-
come an annual event there
donealmost entirely by members
of the school. '
The producers believe that
“For the young actors, the work
provides a ﬁne education in the
understanding and appreciation
-of Shakespeare. Members of the
_ cast can ‘come into contact with
people of other countries, not
only inside of churches and mu-

seums, but in homes as it is only‘

there that the spirit of a country
can be seen.”
Most Audiences English
Different from other Hailey-
bury performances, this year’s
audience include mostly-English-
speaking members. And it is fit-
ting that proceeds from the show,
sponsored at Pitt by the Eng-
lish department to educate the
Englishmen will go toward
scholarships to send students to
‘study at Stratford-on-Avon.
With the exception of poor
projection, “Macbeth” presented
a vivid picture oflshakespearean
theater. Elizabethan setting pre-
vailed in the "Commons Room
from the three witches scream-
ing “Fair is foul and foul is fair”
on the balcony to Malcom’s ﬁnal
crowning three feet away from
the first row of the audience.
We’d like to see more of this.

Excerpts from Peake

(Editor’s Note: Following are
excerpts from letters which the
new Assistant Chancellor _on
Student Affairs Dr. Charles H.
Peake sent to University ad-
ministrators earlier in the year,
expressing his philosophy on
student quarters and thinking.

Peake‘-arrived at the’ Univers-
ity for a three-clay stay today
during ‘which he will confer
with architects and students.)

, To Dr. Edward Litchfieldf

. Chancellor. ,
(November 25. 1955)
" An abstract list of activities,

' developed without relation to the

immediate situation, would, Ibe-
lieve, be sterile. But given the

principles, the assistant chan-‘

‘cellor -can stimulate creative
t h i n k i n g ‘
among exist-

ing agencies,

‘ integral part in a vital University
educational" program. Its broad
purpose is to enrich and enhance
the total development, intellect,-
ual and social, of each student.

“It must help ‘to create and
sustain a University atmosphere
of learning; a ‘climate’ which fos-
ters intellectual values and the
serious pursuit .. of professional
competence. It must provide cer-
tain services designed to heighten
the motivation and thereby close
the gap ‘between a student’s po-
tentialities and his a c t u al
achievement.

“It must promote -those social_

arrangements and a c t i v i t i e s
which will develop the ‘student’s
insight and skill in interpersonal
relations, his capacity for.demo-
cratic leadership, his sense of so-
cial responsibility, and his avo-
cational interests.” _

in all
areas can de-
velop th e
speciﬁcs in a
sound evolu-
tionary way.
“If the as-
sistant chan-

 

the big view,
he will go be-
yond organizations and activi-
ties, and consider such matters

. as ‘ways to enhance the contem-

plative atmosphere of the Uni-
versity, ways to counteract the
tensions born of commuting pres-
sures round the clock. ..
, “He will try to develop not
only ways of bringing students
together for desirable purposes,
but will try to ﬁnd ways of pro-
viding for individual isolation,
quiet retreats for thinking, read-
ing, writing, small informal dis-
cussions.

“He will be concerned that the
bookstore be more than a dis-
penser of textbooks, that it stim-
ulate the student’s intellectual
curiosity and enrich his growth.
The ‘halls of ivy,’ however hack-
neyed, has at bottom, rather pro-
found significance.” '

To Captain William C. Fisher.
Superintendent of Physical

, presentatives from universities

‘ . Freshmen To Test
_ To initiate this system at Pitt,
 they have one semester’s orienta-
tion for the entire student body.
Concurring with the opinion
of the Relations Committee, the

system should affect not only
tests and quizzes but any written
work submitted by students and
inquiries about the exams taken

Plagued with Injuries

By JOHN FAY

.With a dual meet this Saturday at Annapolis, Coach
Carl Olson’s injury-ridden squad will face its next big hurdle
of the outdoor season as they run against a powerful Mid-
shipmen .team'. Olson hoped that Corny Salvaterra, who has
an inured foot, would be able to compete in the discus throw
andshot put, both events being strong spots on the Navy
squad, but the Panther’s big man in the ﬁeld events will
not recover in time to start. Thus, the Blue and Gold will

game will commence at 3 p.m.

Dave Peays, who along with Herb Carper has been car-
rying the load for the team in the sprints, is plagued with a

pulled muscle in his right thigh¢

which may keep him out of the
Middie meet entirely. Coach 01-
son is not planning to take Peays
with the team to Annapolis unless
there s a marked improvement in
his condition.

There seems to be no end to the
list of injuries to key men because
Carper is also a doubtful starter
having strained a muscle in his

end. This leaves the Panthers weak
in an event which has been one
of the few consistently bright spots
in this »year‘s track season.
Panthers Strong in Hurdles '
In other events things do not
look quite as gloomy with Perry
Jones, Bill Green and Paul Thrash
showing s t e a d y improvement.
Thrash will be entered in high

Arnie Sowell is being counted

to bring home an assortment of
ﬁrst places starting with the broad
jump where‘ he will get support

will probably be a tough assign-
ment for the Panther star since
the Midshipmen are loaded with
talent in this event.

Smith will be competing in
his specialty, the pole vault,
where he is being counted on for
a. high ﬁnish. Sowell comes back
on the scene at about this point
to run the 440-yard dash. Ed
Saunders is expected to join So-
well with either Green or Heﬂin.

Dick Cox will run in the dashes

and Peays, dependingon how their
injuries react to treatment. There

is a possibility that Cox will 'run

Dave Freas, Wendell Harford,
and Jim Moore will be the Blue

Navy’s Meukow should give the

also give Sowell a good race in

Sowell will run his specialty,

they try to rack up points for a.

Panthers Start ‘Farm System’
With Trainer McGill As Chief

Although Coach Bobby Lewis’ baseballers are ﬁnding
it very difficult to win games this season, they now stand at
2-7-——things look much brighter for next year and the ones_

to follow.

NCAA rules don’t allow -a freshman to play a varsity
sport. By the time an athlete lays off a season, he tends to
become rusty, which usually results in subpar performances
until he can adjust himself to the:

skills of the game again.

To compensate for this short-
coming, the Panther athletic head
has adopted a “farm system” to
supply future playing material
for Coach Lewis. _

"No, its not illegal recruiting,

but merely the formation of a
freshman baseball team with
Trainer Roger McGill as the
coach. '

Of Being An All-American?

By Steve Bufchock
Sports Writer

Why do schools such as Oklahoma and Notre Dame have
All-America football selections year after year while some
ofthe other schools possess players of equal caliber who
never receive the mythical honor? ,

This is a question that is kicked around like the old pig-
skin during the football season. Many solutions are offered

holds water as does the publicity angle.

Of course, the players’ performances on the ﬁeld are
the main reasons, but don’t let this free advertising slant
—publicity—-escape. _

All the wire services and
the national magazines have
their teaml chosen by the _mid-
point of the grid season. They
are chosen by writers and
sportscasters who usually ’
neverhave seen them play,
butﬂyét cast a vote for the
big-name star. How do they
do it? The answer is the pub-,-
licity which the particular
player receives. What he does
in the last half of the season
has little effect on his All-
American status.

there have beenrsome All-East
honors bestowed upon our
gridders such as Henry Ford,
John Paluck, and Joe Walton,
for instance, but we have
never had a bona-ﬁde All-American since the days of two
platoon football when Eldred Kraemer and Joe Schmidt
were selections on the defensive unit.

 "This is the sorry situation that now exists. We have
an All-American candidate; all we have to do now is get
him recognized. His name is ‘Joe Walton. Last year

performing tremendously at his left end position.

In last year’s encounter, the
