After" Monday’s stormy session
on the merits and demerits of

joining the National Student As-
sociation,‘ student legislators at
Pitt are now faced with the prob-
lem of determining if joining is
worth the cost.

According to estimates of NSA
ofﬁcials, Pitt’s. ﬁnancial obliga-
tions in entering the group would
be quite large since fees are de-
termined on the basis of 'size of

" undergraduate body.
Unoﬂicial ﬁgures indicate the
entrance fee into the national
group will approximate $140

 

_NS 

   

dollars, and yearly dues would
be about the same. In addi-
tion, regional dues of about $60
would be expected. '
Expenses of delegates to re-
gional and national meetings of
the group would probably bring
the total cost to about $800 in the
opinion of Student Congress
treasurer Dan Berger. e
Despite the charges that NSA
is pink fringed and that it is a‘
political“ pressure group, debate
‘on the question of whether to

join or not seems‘ to center on

the question of “is it worth it?”
The main points in the argu-

 

ment for aﬁiliation seem to— be
that Pitt will benefit from
membership through services
rendered by the‘ group and in
participation in its activities.
Of these arguments some stu,-
dent leaders have stated that _par-
ticipation in activities is the only
valid reason since‘ most of the

services offered by NSA ‘can._be

had by" non-member -schools.
The NSA Travel Service for
instance, the agency that gets re-
ductions for collegians on Euro-
lpean travel, was used last year

 Morton Blumenfeld, Educ., ’54

they will not uncover anything
anyway. No, one will admit he’s
a Communist.”

William Green, Educ., ’53—
“Yes, it’s a large institution and

Clarke Staab, C0l., ’56—“Yes,

there is no Communism here.”

James Bell, Educ., ’54-—-“There
would naturally be some students
who have communistic tendencies
in the school but I don’t think that
they can do anything about it.”

Tony Carosella, Educ., ’54—“No,
I think this investigation busi-
ness has made this country
afraid.” '

Surveys . of’ governmental pro-
ceedures and .similar projects
may all be had for slight fees
(which member schools are also
charged).

The contention that participa-
tion in NSA affairs alone would
be worth the cost is held by some
of the politicos.

Recently, NSA has‘ taken a
‘stand on many issues vital to
American college students. It
lately expressed its disapproval
of Universal Military Training.
It has propounded the cause
of a. student bill of rights and
academic freedom. It ‘has held

   

    

  s ii—wor+.hi the   osr?-—— *

seats on UNESCO and the Na“-
tional Education Council.

If NSA is to be recognized as 

the voice of the American college
student, some of the legislators

argue, then Pitt ought to have a a

voice in its activities. .
Members of WSGA, Men's
Council, and Student Congress
will hash over the problems in
their meetings between now and
the beginning of next semester.
Jack Burwinkél, SC prexy,
predicted that formal action on
the joining of the group would
not be taken in’ Congress until,
Men’s\Council and WSGA state
their stand. 

 

Shift Necessary 
I By JOHN'De NINNO  e _
When the proposed Student Union building is built” it

will not be on the‘ Cathedral

campus.

According to Rufus H. Fitzgerald, chancellor, popular
opinion has been that the Union building wouldbe located
somewhere between.Heinz Chapel and the Cathedral. ‘

Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle disclosed this week

that plans for the “much needed” student gathering spot. ~-
brightened when the government eased restrictions‘ on build-1 ’

ing material: He also said“ that. — - -

. the Union would be constructed

as close to the University popu-

lation as possible, indicating the

lower campus.
Not Practical
However, Dr. Fitzgerald shat-
tered the idea'when he said it
would no longer be practical to

build here on campus because of
limited space. .
He mentioned that plans have

actually been launched for an “ex-

panded campus” and that a Stu-
dent Union would be part of that
campus. ’ U -

Dr. Fitzgerald said, “No money
has been collected for a Union as
such. ' But the money ‘obtained
from students in the form of the

University fee has been put aside A

for buildings of thattype. The
Field House has been a result of
such a fund.’ But it, is" still un-
paid for. Next on the list-is the

Contributions Used

tions which are being used in ex-

administration is actively plan-4

He mentioned that Dean of
Women Helen’ P. Rush, Dean
Biddle, and himself have drawn
up plans and exchanged ideas
‘concerning such a building. “Ar-
chitectural plans are in early
stages,” he added. _ -

Dr. Fitzgerald was instrumental
in having a Student Union built
while he waslat the University of
Iowa. “I hope one is -in the near

is that they cannot be. compar-
ed with other_'marks. Students
think they can and everyone is
properly impressed by a high\
QPA, but no one knows what the‘
QPA really means.

For example Professor G be-
lieves that anyone who is wise
enough to take his course.de-
serves at least a “B.” If a stu-
dent doesn't fall asleep, he gets
an “A.”' Professor I-I who teaches
the same course at another hour
thinks that the ﬁeld is over-
crowded and needs thinning out.
He encourages “quality” by giv-
ing one “A” every time he gets
an IQ of 180 or over. a

.'l.BIl  IIAII

My system would _solve the _

confusion engendered by these
professional ‘idiosyncrasies by
making Professor G’s “A” worth

_four points, ‘and Professor, H’s

“B” forth four points. A person
who gets ‘an “A” in Professor
H’s class" will get six points and
a scholarship ‘to Princeton's In-
stitute for Advanced Study. _

This system can be extended
to other cases_of people getting
out of step at mar-king time.

  

 
    

One department at Pitt habit-
ually‘ ﬂunks half of its fresh.-
men. A “C” in this department
would be worth an “A” in some
other department. Unlike Pitt’:
system, which now subtracts one
point for every cred\1t when a
student receives an “F,” some
students would even get points
for “F’s.” This would be a sort
of reward for
enough to take the course,
Scientific Detachment

Some of my fellow scientists
have suggested that points be
awarded for taking boring
courses or ones which contain

no coeds, but I have always re- 
sisted suchfanaticism for a true_ I

is to only compensate for differ-_
ences which can carefully de-
rived from scientiﬁc data.

For Better Future

Q,

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
' Sports Editor

Last December Pitt oiﬁcially became a member college
of the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference. The announce-
ment didn’t create much excitement on the H111 or down-
town but the action did satisfy Pitt’s desires to be more
friendly with its eastern neighbors. I .

“We simply expressed good faith,” Frank Carver, ath-

lletic publicity director, said, “with other eastern schools and

threw our weight behind eastern athletic circles. We stand to gain
nothing by joining with them,” Carver continued, “except reaiﬁrm
our desire to continue pleasant relationships with its members-

which include about 90 schoo .”

"Basically, the conference serves_as a clearinghouse for eligibility
and scheduling problems. During its tenure as an affiliate, Pitt. en-
joyed the many privileges of ‘the member schools, except the right to

vote in conference matters,_ In theé A b

W o uld b e
settled by a
neutral ob-

_server—the ACAC. “Formerly,”

   

-Carver joked,‘ “we made our

own. rules.” ,

As far as scheduling is con-‘
cerned Pitt’s tieup with the east-
erners deﬁnitely clears the smoke
as to where it stands in regard to
choosing opponents. “We would
like to add a few eastern schools,
to our; football schedule in the
next few years,” he said, “but
since many of the teams are tied
up with the Ivy League or other
conferences it’s difficult to clear,
the way.”

In other sports, too, Pitt’s trend
is equally as strong for schedul-
ing eastern teams as against the
Big Ten foes. By reaffirming its
position, though, Pitt stands a
better chance to‘ enter its wrest-
ling, tennis, and track squads in
conferences where they will com-
.pet_e against the best the eastern
section can offer.

As f for the ECAC, it’s just
an ‘administrative conference—
just as Carver said.

right out of the frying pan into
