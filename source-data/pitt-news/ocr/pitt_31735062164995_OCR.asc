agencies, and investigated the
workings of “family -courts” now
operating in other states, saw
many beneﬁts in an integrated
“family court”. : ,

Wide Jurisdiction
Jurisdiction would extend over
divorce and annulment; proceed-
ings .for support and mainten-
ance; and proceedings concerning
juveniles.

Such a system would provide
a common repository for family
records. Judges in the system
would become specialists in their
ﬁeld and be able to develop ex-
pertness. '
Foster described one of » the
major attributes of a “family
court” is its concentration on
therapy and reconciliation rather
than punishment. This is in ac-
cordance with a modern theory of
law that is gaining in popularity.

Civil War History Books

Civil War history is getting a non-partisan boost on both
sides of the Mason-Dixon Line with the University of Ken-

tucky Press at one end and
Press at the other.
B.oth presses are helping

the University of Pittsburgh

each other by promoting two

recently completed books on the great sectional conflict.

The publications are “The North:

Reports" the Civil War”, “Lincoln
and the Bluegrass—Slavery and
the Civil War in Kentucky”.
\ Publications Go To Public
There are 40 some university

lpresses, which publish books inl

order that their research go be-
yond the classroom to the general
public.

.“Lincoln and the Bluegrass-—
Slavery and the Civil. War in
Kentucky” is written by: Wil- .
liam H. Townsend 3. Lexington
lawyer, and published by the
University of Kentucky Press.
This book is a narrative of
Lincoln’s relationship with the
Bluegrass region. ,

The author believes that the

Bluegrass section, the only part‘ of
the slave-holding South that
Lincoln knew intimately, was in-
ﬂuential in shaping his views on
emancipation and secession.

A Best Seller
In regaming this book, Bruce

Denbo, director of University of
Kentucky Press, says, “This book
is one of our best-sellers in the
South”.

“The North Reports the Civil

War” is written by J. Cutler An-
drews, head of the history de-
partment at Cliatham College,
formerly known’ as the Penn-
sylvania College for Women,
and published by the University
of Pittsburgh Press. p '
’ Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett, direc-
tor of University of Pittsburgh
Press, says that this book is so

popular that they are completely .

soldout of them and the book is
being reprinted.

In regarding the promotion of
these books through the co-opera-
tion of both presses, Mrs. Starrett
says that this is one of the list
books sponsored by the Buhl
Foundations of Pittsburgh, and

their grant makes it possible for-

the press to oﬁer the book at less
than it really costs to print.

T 0 Be A Freshman!

Oh,vto be a freshman! Despite what folks say about

difficult, adjustment and little “know-how,” there are bene-_ _ _ _ _
does a superior performance in

-fits which accrue only tothese novices. Take for example
Pitt Players tickets which can be used’ for the ﬁrst time
tomorrow, Friday and.Saturday nights for the ﬁrst show
ofthe current season, “Bernardine.” ‘
-For most people, cost will be nominal. for a program
which has proven good enough in the past to compare on
professional standards. Upperclassmen can buy season

tickets for three dollars. Those who arelchained may want ;

to pay extra to bring along an evening’ sweetheart—or, "if
wealthy, a sweetheart an evening.

But freshmen are different. They are a privileged class?
according to the ,wicked stage contingent. Season tickets.

are being sold them for one dollar—for all four shows. For
at least the Thursday performance of “Bernardine,” all
fresh will be permitted to bring dates free. 3

This is good. This is important. This will undoubtedly

be the beginning of a .captive,‘l6yal audience. for the, rest}
of this year and for future seasons. Certainly, if thespians 1

maintain the high standards of performance that they es-
tablished last year, the newcomers will enjoy bo.th educa-
tional and entertaining "theater, .a definite asset towards
liberal education. V " y , ' “ V
But for upperclassmen, actors need offer nothing more
than the special rate of three dollars for four shows that was
introduced last year. They are aware that good, clean fun,
skilfully enough handled to instigate belly—aches, is enough
‘to attract‘ the more sagacious studentjbodty. .

This. year Players start out with a, different show, but '.

the same author who wrote last year’s opener-——Mary Chase.
Last season. “Harvey” .stirred excitementand laughter de-
spite that no one ever saw him. Housewife Chase has fol-
lowed the same .titl_e-role formula for the ‘current produc-
tion“‘Bernardine.” It should show a good time. .

So, cut-rate prices or not, we urge students and facult
to stop in and visit with the “Bernardine” cast. For fresh-
men it will be a new experience. ‘ »

Come to think of it, it’ll be a new experience for most
upperclassmen, too. ' ‘ .

  Harriers Seek Seventh ,ISeers Split On Pitt,PicIc Farmers)-ll

Against Buck Runners

Looking for their seventh win out of eight starts this
year, the Panther harriers make their ﬁnal dual-meet ap-
gearance of the campaign against a potent Ohio ‘State ‘seven

riday at Schenley Park.

The 4 p.m. meet bringstogetherhtwo of the district’s

‘cross-country teams.

The:

Buckeyes are reported to be much
stronger than last year’s con-
tingent ‘which dropped »a 23-35
decision to the locals.

The‘ Olsonmen, ho Never, ap-
pear to be getting stronger each
week. In Saturday’s test against
highly-rated Georgetown, ﬁve
Panthers crossed the ﬁnish line
before a single Hoya made an
appearance at the ﬁnal stripe.

In addition to the great form
or Panther Captain, Arnie Sowell,
Coach Carl Olson had many other
reasons for optimism. Thornton
Smith’s second-place ﬁnish was a
big surprise and indicates that
the bespectacled Strider has
reached his peak.

Another bright spot has been
the consistently good performance
of Wendell Harford. Along with
Jack Shubertand Perry, Jones, he
has repeatedly placed high up.in
the results.

After the Ohio State bout, the
thinclads will embark for New
York and the IC4A’s where they
will try to cop the elusive num-
ber one spot after two straight
second places. V

The Junior Varsity and fresh-
men will also get a chance to
show their wares this ‘weekend’
when they participate in the
Junior AAU Championships Sat-

u.rday morning in Schenley Park. .

to pick the National ‘Agricultural

The contest, originally slated

Student Union, Sneak Preview

Gothic Style Planned

By NANCY C. JONES
(Editor’s Note: This is the second of a series of articles on Pitt’s
.planned Student Uniorz~Men’s Dormitory building.)

A sneak preview of the Student Union and men’s d_or-
mitory plans on Mnoday unfolded a modiﬁed _Goth1c build-
ing sprawling across the'lot bounded by Ruskin Ave., Bige-
low Blvd., Tennyson Ave., and Fifth Ave. Rolls of process
drawings done by Ingam, Boyd, and Pratt_Co.,,the. building
architects, and A. E. Klimcheck, University architect, are
about to be submitted for preliminary approval to University

: authorities—Chancellor C. B. Nut-¢_ ' '
ting, Board of Trustees, and
others. \ ,

“According to Dean of ‘Men T.
W. Biddle, ground will be broken
in Apr., 1956 (for the Student
"Union and men’s dormitory,
which will be built in “one big
operation”. By summer of 1957

»all the men’s dormitory and 1/3
ofthe Union will be ﬁnished. Or
in other words, all the building
on the lot bounded by Ruskin,
Bigelow, Tennyson, and Fifth.

Ultimately the Union will
stretch across Tennyson .Ave.
and onto the .lot bounded by

non-dormitory students. P i t t ’ s
Union will be_ situated so that it
can be central and of‘ use to all
groups. It has been suggested that
the houses on Bigelow Blvd. op-
posite the U n i o n-dormitories
would make a good “fraternity
row,” thus bringing fraternities
nearer the central core.
0 Plans of the Union show a
large eating hall in the base-
ment, and room for a dance hall
that could accommodate 400
people on the second ﬂoor. The
three story building also con-

/i; -

Tennyson, Bigelow, and Lytton.'
On that lot, yet to be secured, a
women’s dormitory will be built ',
as the ﬁnal wing of the U-
shaped building. V
The _men’s dormitory, with
which the University hopes to.
“attract quality .out-of-town stu—:
dents” will house 319 men. The
plans provide for double rooms‘
12 by .16 feet, with two closets,
beds, and desks. The modiﬁed
Gothic building, which goes back
in step fashion so that most rooms
have’windows, rises at one point
to a height of -six ﬂoors.

Lounges Planned ,

To show the step» effect, 92 boys
will live on the ﬁrst”ﬂoo’r, 94 on
the second, 86 on the third, 19 on
the fourth, and 12 on both the
ﬁfth and sixth ﬂloors. Two
lounges are shown in the plans

“These dormitorieswill give us
spirit, breadth, and national repu-
tation,” said‘ Dean Biddle. He said
the lack ‘of dormitories has hamp-
ered Pitt and has been responsi-
ble for the lack of out-of—town
students in quantity and quality.

Cost of building the ‘ men"s
dormitory and one-third of the
"union is. ‘approximately $3 mil-
lion. The ‘Union will be situated
between the men’s and the wom-
en’s dormitory and will thus be
a’ center for student_life, pr.ovid-
ing the dormitory and non-
dormitory students 1' with facili-
ties.

In other universities, Unions’: “ ‘

have often become centers for
non-fraternity, non-activity, or

tains room for lounges, and a
snack bar.

Sororities may be brought? into

-y the scene by having suites in the
,women’s dormitory. This too is

still in the realm of ideas, since
no deﬁnite plans have been begun,
for the women’s dormitory.
