Zii-Floats, Dance at
Army Weekend

By MILLARD AMDUR
Mark Rubinstein, Col. ’57,
chairman of homecoming, an-
nounced at the Student Con-
gress meeting of Monday, Oct.
8, that all homecoming events

W_Hwil‘l be staged during the

it Qlrmy weekend. The members of
_....;the committee at ﬁrst believed

that homecoming would either
have to be rescheduled to another
weekend or cancelled because of
a formal dance for 1,000 cadets in
the Commons Room, Saturday
evening, and the expected crowd-
ed condition of the stadium for
the game.

The proposed schedule of
events begins at 2:30 p.m. on
Friday, Nov. 16', when all classes
will be dismissed. A ﬂoat" pa-
rade, based on the general
theme of “Nursery Rhymes,”
will commence at 2:40 p.m. The
deadline for completion of
house decorations will be 9 p.m.

pep-rally, and bonﬁre will re-
sume during the course of which
the various trophy winners will
be announced.

Saturday morning, pre—game
brunches will be served at fra-
ternity l*ouse_s’. At half-time,
homecomingqueen will be
crowned and tropheis will-be pre-
sented. Open-house at fraternity
houses will begin at -4:15 p.m. It
may be possible for 150-200 Pitt

rﬂeligion - In

- Life Goes

To ’ Year - Long Project

By ED BACHMAN
Religion-In-Life at Pitt, long a traditional week—long in-

stitution held here eachgyear,

will soon expand into a year-

long project. This was decided last weekend when the Pitt
Student Council of‘Reli_gious Organizations held a retreat at
Camp Kon-O-Kwee, near Zelienople, Pa.

Studying a survey conducted with 37 of the colleges and

universities throughout the nation:

Vwhich undergo extensive religious

w,\11;rojects on their campuses, the

itt Council considered three al-
ternativesfor their coming 1956-
57 program. These were:

1) Continuation of the past
practice of setting one week
throughout the year as a ‘Re-
ligion-in-Life Week, during
which a convocation speaker is
obtained along with classroom
and ﬁreside speakers, and
speakers which visit fraternity,
sorority and other organization
meetings;

3). An overall year-long pro-
‘gram with no specific emphasis on
one week; and

3) A combination of the above .

two ideas.

The consensus of the 30 mem-
bers of the Student Council of
Religious Organizations who at-

 ynded the Kon-O-Kwee meeting

last weekend was that the third
alternative should be accepted.
The year-long program will be put

 

into effect with the possibility of
bringing in a speaker to address
the University during a week set
up sometime next spring.

Many suggestions were
brought forth concerning the
way this year- long program
will be handled, but ﬁnal de-
cision will be made at a meet-
ing of the Council on Oct. 15.
Six main suggestions will be
brought up at that meeting.
They are: '

1) Freshman orientation at the
beginning of each semester, with
open houses staged for each of the
14 religious organizations on the
Pitt campus;

2) World University Service
extended to Pitt. This is a type
of education on campus. where
students give to students rather
than concentrating on outside
personnel brought in. This would
be worked through the three
major faiths, by way of the

Opens in New Office

By MORRIS

STAMPFER.

Pitt’s own “electronic brain” was formally dedicated in
ceremonies held Monday. More formally known as the Com-
putation and Data Processing center, the equipment, located
in 825 Cl., will be used for faculty and graduate research in
all departments of the University. Classes using thé equip-
ment have already been scheduled. ‘ ‘

Featured at the dedication were’
Dr. B. Gold, secretary of the Data
Processing Center planning com-
mittee; W. G. Brandt, head of the
University Department of Inter-
national Business Machines Corp-
oration; Chancellor Edward H,
Litchfield; and Professors Samuel
Hanna and Donald G. Schindler,
who are on the staff of the center.

Dr. Gold introduced the
guests to the center and its fa-
cilities, and Mr. Brandt spoke
about the role of colleges in de- -
veloping the potentials of elec-
tronic data processing. Dr.
Litchﬁeld explained Pitt’s plans
and programs for the center. He
also pressed the button starting
the machine.

Schindler and Hanna then
demonstrated the capabilities of
the equipment in solving prob- ’
lems.

At present the center is under
the direction of an executive com-
mittee headed by Prof. J. F. Cal-
vert, head of the department of
electrical e n g i n e e r i n g. Other
members are Dr. Gold, Dr. James
S. Taylor,’ head of the mathema-
tics department; Dr. Alexander J.
Allen, head of the radiation lab-
oratory; Dr. Antonio Ciocco, head
of the Bureau of Business Re-
search. A director will soon be
selected for the center.

The “brain” is leased from
its manufacturer, the Interna-
_ tional Business Machines Cor-
poration. It can perform mathe-

Women of the class of ’58 will
hold an “Arabian Nights Dinner”
in Far Eastern style on Thursday,

Appetizer will ‘be the Arabic
dish known in English as Chi-
chi beans with sesame seed sauce.
A casserole dish of Syrian bread,
rice, and beans with meat will be
next. Desert is to be Syrian Leb-
anses salad, Arabic Delight and

~Arabic dances and poetry

readings in foreign languages
and English translations will be
part of the program. Through-
out the evening ‘Arabic music
will be played. '

In its original Arabic form, the c

menu for the junior class dinner
reads: Himas bee thaini, Ghobz
souray, Riz, Lubee bee laham,
Salata suray Lubninea, and
Rahat—Ul—Halkoom Kahwa.

Cost of the dinner is $1, paya-

speeds—-addition can be made
at the rate of 80,000 per second.

This, according to Schindler
and Hanna, permits problems to
be solved which would never have
been attempted becziuse of the
length of time required. “Time is
important in many businesses,”
said Dr. Hanna, “and now with
such equipment problems can be
solved before the answers lose
their value. Also, a degree of ac-
curacy not previously possible
can be obtained.”

Full-scale use of the computa-
tion equipment will begin soon.

Likely to be noted for his unusual ideas is Jay Butler,
newcomer to Pitt’s campus this fall.
Jay’s special interest is poetry.

his school nrates were cursing

the world’s greatest poetry—and writing some -of his own

to boot.

as play writing, short stories, and
essay writing in addition to poe-
try.

. An essay of his, printed in
the High School “Literary Cav-
alcade” was especially signifi-
cant on the subject “VVhy John-

The essay lays the blame for the
current student apathy toward

‘Shelley for being elfeminate or
who assigns a list of poems, ask-

student interest in an understand’-

. Meaning Summaries

All too many teachers think
the meaning of a poem can‘ be
summarized in some cliched gen-
eralization, he-charges. But good
poetry is not just that; it is an
expression of the complexities of
feeling -in an intensiﬁed experi-
ence.

The writing of good poetry is
an act of creation that ap-

opinion. It involves an intense
awareness of your surroundings,
and a masterful control of
words to recreate on paper the
feeling and detail that is pres-
ent.

Jay, born and raised in Ogden,

~Utah, in the morm'oric tradition, is
a well-disciplined, intensely eager
writer. '

He is proud of his early success
as a writer, but he anxiously
acknowledges the influence of Mr.

is important to him, and he in’

Experimental Idea
In Education Tried
On Camping Trip

An experiment In a new form
of education will be carried out
by students and teachers of the
University of Pittsburgh’s Falk‘
School.

Fifty students accompanied by
their instructors will take an out-
door education camping trip to
Camp Carondowanna near Zelie-
nople, Pa. Seventh and eighth

./«gﬁziders will leave Falk School by

Oct. 8 and return Oct. -12.

During the week of “school,”
students will study nature, camp-
craft, geology, astronomy, history,
zoology, and other lessons.

Dr. James Gray, principal of the
Falk School, said this is a new
type of educational program for
the school and has not been used
in Pennsylvania before, although
it has proved successful in New
York, New‘ England and Cali-
fornia. schools.

up to the present. ,

Russia, quick to seize the advantage, was one

Russians, however, sign only year-by-year con-

as to regularly of annual income.

But as important as trade economics, Russian-

there are Russian cars on the roads, trucks on the

in Iceland—as apparent as “Bear With Me” por-
tents in the Middle East.

Each of these areas is affected by United States
foreign’ policy-—and the effects of our unrealistic
policy are revealing in the losses America suffers
in’its ﬁght against Communist domination.

The national press has for-
tunately brought both issues to
light within recent weeks; to
point out these issues is our ob-  —
jective, to evaluate them should
be yours.

Journalist-diplomat Porter Mc-
Keever has "outlined in the‘Oc-
tober~ Harper’s Magazine the
lessening American inﬂuences in
Iceland; Scripps—Howard staff
writer R. H. Shackford has begun a series com- -
paring Soviet inﬁltration -of the Middle East with
Communist tactics in China.

General Theme

A general theme runs through commentary of
both crisis: The United States has engaged almost
wholly in_activities to counter Russian strategy
without taking strong offensiveimeasures of its own
to combat either Russian domination, Communist
ideology or both.

The Soviet has outfoxed our Washington execu-
tives by switching to economic assistance to gain
its ends just as we had scaled our budget to meet
the enemy’s military tactics. We have not been
quick enough to return to a policy of realistic
economic reciprocity; when we do, we should hope
it will not be too late.

Only the Facts

In his article “How to Throw away an Air
Base,” Mr. McKeever relates the following facts:
In 1950, Iceland, alarmed with a steadyudecline in
their ﬁsh supply, extended its three-mile boundaries
to four—miles for conservation purposes.

Britain delayed the regulation until the‘lnter-'

November 6 marks the day when a number of Ameri-
can citizens will go to the polls and cast their presidential
ballot. ‘Each voter will have based his choice on varying
reasons. Some will have weighed the issues heavily .-and
will have deducted -from this reasoning that their -candidate
maintains the best policies toward the issues. Some will
have allowed personalities to enter the question, inﬂuenced
by eloquent speeches, smiles, or personal favors. The choice

Too many of them will be voting on factors other than
decisions made in Israel and Egypt or stands taken on civil
rights, foreign aid, or the farm bill.

With this situation in mind, a college student casting a
ballot November 6 should realize more than ever the im-
portance of his responsibility. A student today ﬁnds him-
self in the unique position of being trained to think criti-
cally. He also has the opportunity to build a strong founda-

opportunity of being trained to vote intelligently is at the
student’s ﬁngertips. Whether he will use it is questionable.

Intelligent voters have been taking their stand for
some time now. They realize it is not done on the morning
or afternoon of election day. They have had excellent tools

to help them think——the newspapers, the radio, and the"

public speeches to mention a few. There is certainly no
excuse for not being well informed. .

A’ Union's Meaning

the student’s very own. To go
as far as to say the Unioncan
‘be a second home at a city school
is a bit far-fetched at the present
time. But to students living on
campus,‘ in one room, day after
day, the Union is the ﬁrst place
they consider that has the
warmth which everyone misses
at times.

For a completely different at-
mosphere, a student union is de-

having a coke

in a spacious
smoke free atmosphere. -

The Union was the place to go
to ‘read the latest magazine, your
hometown newspaper, or an all-
campus bulletin board that post-
ed every’ activity and event for
the day. At the Union, a show-
case in the main lounge had a
different exhibit of cultural in-
terest that changed frequently.
The walls of the lounges were‘
often adorned with art, religious
and other exhibitions.

The loud speaker system
throughout the three floors of
the building brought music for
studying in most of the lounges.

Union to hear the game and
cheers were sent across the
country via mental telepathy
sound waves.

Many Purposes

In the evening, during the
week, the Union served many
purposes. It was a place to study,
to meet your friends to watch
television, or relax. It was a
place to hear a lecture, see a
dixie land jazz concert, an edu-

taken we have not seenyit.

most of us think of Pitt’s Union
at the present time. Before long,
most of us will stop and think
every once in a while that Pitt
had never been,without this in-
tangible feeling about a place
which every college needs to
bring more than just a textbook
atmosphere to its students.

On 13-Week Trip
During Summer

By GORDON CLOWNEY

~ On his thirteen week excur-
sion to Europe this summer,
engineering st u d e n t Paul
Thomas, was interested main-
ly in the general outlook of
European industry.

Paul spent eight weeks in Scot-
land, where for a while,’he lived
in the town of Coupar-Angus,
only ﬁve miles from the birth-

1’ place of the late great Pitt foot-

ball coach, Jock Sutherland.
1 Future Ambition

, It is Paul’s ambition to become
a foreign service engineer. He re-
ceived a close insight into his in-
tended .profession by living for
awhile with a foreign service en-
gineer in the Saar Basin, between
France and Germany.

Paul reports that the type of
production in Europe, in contrast
to the American way, is very leis-
urely and unhurried. This results-
in a low rate of production, but

.!a....,,,,“)at the same time these unhurried

in-'

smethods keep the accident rate at
a minimum.

When a change of shifts oc-
curs in one of their. factories,
all the men on the outgoing shift
hop on their bicycles and ride
out of the plant in a group,
while the incoming shift, who
are waiting at the gates, ride
in together and proceed to their
various stations.

At lunch hourgin the mills, a
truck comes around to the plant,
selling wine and beer to the work-
ers.

Even though the workers carry
very heavy equipment, and sharp
objects, they don’t wear safety

g-‘workers do, instead they walk

around in soft sneakers.
Serve As Apprentice

Graduate engineers in Europe,
Paul points out, earn only about
ﬁfteen to twenty dollars a week.
They also must serve a two year
apprenticeship before being con-
sidered full fledged engineers.
These engineers must work for
four or ﬁve years after gradua-
tion before ‘they are ﬁnancially
able to afford a, car. This, as Paul
points out is very dissimilar to the
way American engineers are far-

ing.

One of the plants the senior
engineering student visited was
beset with labor troubles. It seems
the bulk of the laboring force
was imported from Algeria. These
workers seemed to think they had
the company management over a
barrel because they constituted
the majority of the available
working force.

So, the workers went on
strike, asking for the following
conditions to be met; (1) three
months paid holiday each year,
(2) travel expenses paid to and
from North Africa, and (3) a
50 percent increase in wages.’

However, the workers weren’t
out more than a week, when com-
pany officials offered them an ul-
timatum, either come back to
work, or return home. The work-
ers returned. This merely illus-
trates how poorly the strike was
organized, and how effective their.
leadership was.

Overnight Hike
One of Paul’s highlights, dur-
ing his‘/stay in the Scottish high-
lands was an overnight hike in

the Cairn Gorm Mountains. Bad

900

Weather ‘turned his party’s return
from the hike into an escape as
they climbed on hands and knees,
carrying two packs up the new
bed of a snow fed stream, with

-the visibility all of six feet.

Paul visited Switzerland at the
decline of the tourist season, when
prices were fairly low. He recalls
one experience he had at a moun-
tain restaurant in the Alps. The
restaurant was at an altitude of
11,000 -feet, and the scene quite
impressive, with one able to sit
and look out upon the clouds and
neighboring glaciers.

_ The menu for the meal, con-
sisted of three bowls. of celery
soup, a double order of roast
vbeef, a double order of French
0 fried potatoes, a double portion
of string beans, desert,‘ and a
-litter of one of the popular ,bev-
erages, all for the price of $1.50.

However, the outstanding op-
portunity in Paul’s opinion was
the chance he had to live with,
and work with many students
from other countries. The sharing
of thoughts, opinions, and atti-
tudes was the real highlight of his
summer’s journey.

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Not Progress

McDonna deﬁned the 17-month
Republican stint in Harrisburg as
not “peace, prosperity, and pro-
gress,” but rather, “delay, defer,
and defeat.”

“The Mayor of Philadelphia
and now to be senator, Joe
Clark,” announced Mayor Law-
rence, and a loud, standing .ova-
tion was given. Clark repeated a
statement mentioned in a rally for
Estes Kefauver, “I want you, I
need you, I love. you, is what the
Republicans will play before the
election; on the other side is what
they’ll play after the election,
“See ya later, alligator.” Mr.
Clark went on to conclude that
he would like to be senator, “to
turn the USA“ back to the people
who own it — You.”

The highlight of the evening
was, of course, the introduction
of Harry S. Truman ‘by Com-
missioner Kane. Truman re-
ferred to the President of the ‘
United States as being on cloud

‘nine. He went on to say that
when ‘the Democrats struck
home with sunlight in dark
corners, President Eisenhower
was forced to sit at the edge of
that cloud. ' _

Mr. Truman brought up the in-
famous New and Fair deals as
constituting the most glorious
pages in American history.
Strength, vigor, and vast improve-
ment were seen after taking over
the Republican administration.
“And when the balance is struck,”
he said, “those who proﬁted most,
defame us.” To this, the audience
shouted, “Give ’em hell, Harry.”

The first speaker to be annonced was the President of

David L. Lawrence installed McDonna at the rostrum, and
the speech that followed conﬁnedo-—-~

to praise the magniﬁcent job being
done by Kefauver and Stevenson.

‘.‘The democratic candidates state
world reality and actual facts, un-
like the concoctions of the Re-
publicans.” An interesting item
was brought up concerning the
“ridiculous” conclusion of
GOP.

That is, that the Democrats
rather than the Republicans de-
feated the bill to public legisla-
tion. The statistics of the Kelly
Bill were _119 Democrats—pro, 105
—con, 75 Republicans——pro, ll9—
con. “The‘ same characterized
_failure of Mr. Eisenhower to note
the record,” Truman said, “is
shown as that which made him
run out on General Marshall, the
great architect of World War\.lI.
,Again the audience shouted, “Give
’em Hell.” ‘

“I recommend Joe Clark for
the senate and a delegate of
Democrats to the House of Rep-
resentatives for a New Amer-
ica,” Truman concluded.

In their home opener at the

small but game Eagles. Coach Leo
Bemis was well-pleased with the
improvement of’ his team over

After the game, Bemis com-

beginning to jell now. We con-
trolled the ball more and kept it

— in Lock Haven’s half of the ﬁeld
most of the game.”

Horox Boots Goal

After getting off to a slow -start
in the first quarter, the locals came
alive and smashed home two goals
within a minute and a half late in
the second stanza. Horox, a rela-
an-vtive newcomer to the soccer squad,

Olson, realizing that the Pan-

' caliber of Arnie Sowell, is mak-

ing an effort to build a well bal- _

anced team which can make up
for this deﬁcit.

Team depth was responsible
for last Saturday’s victory over

conditioning.

The top seven Jungle Cat har-
riers appear, to be divided into
two “ﬂights”-—the ﬁrst made up
of Vince Timon, Thornton Smith,
Jimmy Moore, and John Christof,
and the second consisting of Wen-
dell Harford, Tom Jessup,‘ and
Dale Fauser. Olson hopes to have
his second -group pushing theﬁrst

So far, Olson is highly pleased

he did run track and played foot-

When asked about this possibil-
ity, Bemis said, “Right now we
can’t think about the season as a

Freshmen Gridders 

By CHRIS

Clash with Mounties

GILLOTTI V

As far as Coach Steve Petro is concerned, last Saturday
was the beginning of the season for the freshman gridders.
Although next Saturday is their ﬁrst regularly scheduled
game, practice has been going on for almost a month, and
Saturday’s scrimmage with Slippery Rock presented the frosh

in a new light to Coach Petro.

“Before the game I admit I had¢
my doubts about the boys, but
they pleasantly surprised me,"
Petro stated. “I’ll admit they still
have alot to learn, but they really
tried hard and their spirit over-
shadowed the mistakes they made.
Although no actual score was
kept, we outscored them by sev-
eral touchdowns.”

Petro was favorably impress-
ed with the backs, especially
halfbacks Andy Sepsi and Jim
Cox, quarterback Ivan Toncic
and fullback Curt Plowman.

“Since both the Freshmen and
the Junior Varsity played, we
didn’t get a chance to use every-
one we would have liked to,”
Petro explained, “But I have a
pretty fair idea about the boys
who can help us.”

Ernie Westw o o d, 225-pound
tackle from Clairton, looked good
on the line. Petro said “Westwood
and the rest played a terriﬁc game
on defense, considering the fact
that we have been emphasizing
offense in practice.”

Concerning Toncic, Petro said
“He mixed our few plays well,
and all in all, called a good
game.” , '

Saturday the fresh‘ travel tm
Clarksburg, West Virginia, to take

on the Mountaineer freshmen. Al-
though Petro plans to use as much
of the squad as possible, a_fairly
deﬁnite starting team has emerg-
ed.

With Toncic (171) at quarter-
back, Cox (178) and Sepsi (185)
at the halfs, and 194-pound Curt
Plowman at fullback, the Panther
Cubs will start a backﬁeld aver-
aging 182, almost as big as the
varsity.

The line, however, is a dif-
ferent story. The ends, Dave
Helsel and John Patrick weigh
in at only 177 and 189 respec-
tively. -

Westwood at 225 is big enough,
but his tackle partner, Ron Dza-
dony is only 198 pounds.

The starting guards will be
chosen from Nort Seaman (210).
Bob Longfellow (204), Nick Danas
(198) and Al Corﬁeld (190).

Center slot will be shared

013%’ 

among Serafino Fazio (216), Bob '

Rathi (197), and Chuck Marranca
(202). This ‘starting line averages
only 199 pounds, 3 big dip f1‘0'«‘0
the varsity.

If last Saturday Coach Petro
saw the light, this Saturday he’s
hoping to be illuminated.‘ 1

District Business
Changes Are Little
During Past Week

Business in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict last week changed very little
according togthe Bureau of Busi-
ness Research of the University of
Pittsburgh. It has remained at
about the same high level as in
the two previous weeks.

Industrial production a n d
freight shipments were higher,
but the adjusted volume of trade
was down from the week ended
September 22. After allowance
for-. the usual seasonal changes,
the Bureau’s index of general
business activity rose to 204.5
per cent of the 1935-39 average.

_ District steel mill operations,
the backbone of Pittsburgh’s in-
dustrial framework, increased to

101.5 per cent of capacity last 1

week, the highest since late April.
One blast furnace was blown in,
bringing. the total active in the
district to 45. ~ -

Both electric power‘ output and
bituminous coal production were
increased, and freight carloadings
were the highest in three months.

New motor car registrations
rose decidedly in the Pittsburgh
vicinity, and bank clearings were
higher.’ Sales of Pittsburgh de-
partment stores decreased from
the week ended Sept. 22.
