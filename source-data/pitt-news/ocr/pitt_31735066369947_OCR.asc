By ANDREW LUGG

Ten people have been arrested
during the last two weeks on the
fourth floor of the Cathedral of
Learning. The arrests stem from
complaints made by the new College
of General Studies Dean John O.
Bolvien that homosexual activities

’ have been taking place in the men’s

room area of thatifloor.

Plainclothes policehave made l0
arrests from Oct. 4 to Oct. 14,
according to Lt. James Watters of
the Department of Public Safety.

Rising
Transplant

Demands t
Addressed

, By TIM HUNTER

There are over 6,000 people in the
United States waiting for kidneys, ‘
120 waiting for livers, 20 waiting for

hearts and 12 waiting for hearts and V

lungs. . —

Meeting the demand for organs
for transplantation is becoming
increasingly difficult. The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh recently partici-
pated inthe formation of a group
made up of health-related organiza-
tions and professionals concerned
with the problems, of mean
transplantation. . V

Donald Denny, director of Pitt’s
Organ Procurement Transplanta-
tion program, represented the uni-
versity in the formation of the
nationwide American Council on
Transplantation (ACT).

Denny has seen organ procure-
ment programs across the nation but
believes Pittsburgh is the leader in
this emerging medical field.

“Considering the size of the popu-
lation in the Pittsburgh area and the
amountof organs we have acquired.
for transplantation, our procure-
ment program is the best in the
nation,” Denny said.

According to Denny, the forma-
tion of the council is the first step in
improving the effectiveness of organ
procurement around the nation to
equal what the facilities in Pitts-
burgh have accomplished.

Because of the increase in survival
rates for transplant patients within
the past few years, the need for vital
organs has become staggering. Most
of the organs are obtained through
ppst-mortem donation and surgical
procurement. Of these, most dona-
tions come from patients who have
suffered from “brain death.” With-
out the help of the brain, body
organs can continue proper func-
tion, by artificial ventilation and
intravenous therapy, up to the time
that they are removed from the
patient for transplant surgery. Brain
death accounts for only 1-2 percent
of the deaths occurring in hospitals;
for this reason, a highly organized
nationwide system, such as ACT, is
necessary for efficient and effective
organ procurement, Denny said.

The council intends to increase
the availability of organs by moti-

The suspects were charged with
harassment and /or indecent expo-
sure. The majority of the suspects
were not'*affiliated with the univer-
sity, Watters said.

Some people in the CGS office,
which is housed onthe fourth ﬂoor,
saidthis type of activity is not new.
Earline Blackwell, a senior secretary
for_ advisers, said that homosexual
activities have been taking place ever

since she had been with the univer-

sity, which is almost four years.

Senior adviser to CGS Tim Carr

said the floor has had a reputation as
a gay hangout for more than eight
years.

Though no serious attempt has
been made to curtail these activities
until now, almost everyone on the
fourth floor has known about and
tried to ignore them. Blackwell,
whose desk affords a clear view of
the men's room area, said that she
could see streams bf strange‘ men
going to and coming from the men’s
room. Men on the fourth floor have
come to habitually use the third
floor men’s room, she said.

Workers in the CGS, office said
they wondered why these activities
have been allowed to continue for so
long. Until the new dean arrived on
the fourth floor, no one in his office
seemed to know how to deal with the
problem, and the campus police
were rather ineffectual.

Bill McQuaide, a custodian on the
fourth floor, said a reason the activi-
ties have continued for so long is
that the men’s room on that floor
does not have a sign; unlike the
men’s rooms on the second and third
floor.

lsexual. Activity Uncovered In Cathedral

The signs in the men’s room on
those floors have signs that read
“This area is subject to police patrol
— unlawful activity will be
prosecuted.”

The only thin’g.in‘ the fourth floor
men’s room by way of a sign is a
small notice in one of the stalls that
reads “Will be here daily. 1:30 to
2:30.”

The putting up of a sign on the
fourth floor‘ like those on the lower
ﬂoors would be a step, however
small, towards stopping this
unwanted activity, McQuaide said.

Shouts and screams of “Two
thousand, two thousand”
resounded through the fifth floor
of the William Pitt Union as 24
Pitt students discarded their
inhibitions and bet their emo-
tions on the “Wheel of Fortune”
yesterday.

Game show mania descended
on Pitt Monday when Paul Gil-
bert, creative consultant of Merv
Griffen Productions, began
interviewing prospective contest-
ants for the “Wheel of Fortune,”
NBC’s highest-rated daytime
program. Gilbert, who also pro-
duces “Dance Fever," and his
assistant, Lori Golden, were in
town to select three Pitt students
to compete during college week
on a “Wheel” show to be telecast
the week of Dec. 5.

Pitt will compete against
teams from Notre Dame, the
University of Alabama and
UCLA during college week.
Over 50 students attended initial

interviews on Monday, and 24
students returned for yesterday’s
call-back.

Because Pitt was the first
school Gilbert visited, he said‘
there was not much time for
advance publicity. The Pitt Pro-
gram Council, which coordi-
nated the “Wheel” venture,

“Other shows look for the
pretty people,” Gilbert said. “We
look for enthusiasm.”

Enthusiasm was what he
found here. Prospective contest-
ants were in a game show frame
of mind, shouting for the $2,000
marker to appear.

“Talk to the wheel, it helps,”

“Other shows look for pretty people. We
look for enthusiasm.”

- Paul Gilbert

placed two ads in The Pitt News,
distributed leaﬂets and took care
of the interview sign-up sheets.

Yesterday’s competition was
fierce as the final 24 students all
competed for the coveted three
positions. Unlike some game
shows that seek contestants on“
looks, Gilbert said “Wheel” is
different.

Gilbert coaxed.

As the afternoon progressed,
attempts were made to win Gil-
bert’s favor. One student did his
“Jabba the Hutt" impression,
while another was so enthused
that she lost her balance on her
chair and tumbled to the floor.
All students displayed their
brand of enthusiasm in hopes‘

that the wheel would take them
to Los Angeles, where the show
is taped. Gilbert said this was one
of the liveliest groups he had
encountered, adding that proba-
bly 90 percent would be con-
tacted about being contestants at
a later date.
The three student s chosen to
represent Pitt will be notified by
phone some time in the next few
days, according to Gilbert. An
alternate will also be notified and
will accompany the others. Con- ‘
testants must pay their own air-
fare to Los Angeles, but Gilbert
said this can be used as a tax
deduction if the contestant has to
pay taxes on the winnings.
“Wheel of Fortune" is similar
to “hangman.” Contestants spin
a wheel with dollar amounts
ranging from $100 to $2,000 and

contestants can buy vowels for

Interest Renewed In ROTC

By MICHAEL EMERY

During the Vietnam War era,
ROTC programs suffered much
criticism and repudiation on col-
lege campuses throughout the
country, but today, the ROTC
has rebuilt its image and ‘is a “sta-
ble and viable” program, accord-
ing to Lieutenant Colonel
Joseph R. Kolek, .Ir., professor
of aerospace studies at Pitt.

The fact that the job market is,

very tight is as much a reason as
any for the increased enrollment
in ROTC, according to Dr.
Robert J. Nossen, associate pro-
vost and ROTC coordinator at
Pitt for the past 12 years.

“But I think there’s a number

_ of reasons for the renewed inter-

est,” Nossen said. “The financial
aid provided for college students
through ROTC scholarships is
certainly a big factor. I also
believe there's a renewed interest
in national security — not in the
possibility of war; nobody wants

. that — but in recognition of the

need for a strong national

academic year, there were I05
cadets enrolled at Pitt; in 1982-
83, l63 and this year, there are
180.

Despite these statistics, Pitt
still lags behind Penn State and
Indiana University of Pennsylva-
nia in ROTC enrollment,
according to Nossen.

“It’s tougher to recruit in an
urban area as opposed to a rural

’' one,” he says. “There are more

commuting students at a city
school, so a lot of students aren’t
around the campus after classes.
An urban student is also less
inclined to join simply because
there's more things to do in the
city.”

Nossen noted that one differ-
ence in the cadets participating
today from those 10 years ago is
that “they’re definitely better
academically.

“The academic level of the
cadets has improved, thus allow-
ing ROTC to be more selective,
especially the Air Force," he
says. _

Lieutenant Kolek confirmed
this point, citing the Average
Quality Index score taken of all
151 colleges and universities that
offer.ROTC in which Pitt ranked
16th in the country; CMU third.

“Anybody can say they have a
good program, but we have the
proof to back it up, so we’re not
just blowing smoke.”

“The military in general has
been very selective,” Major Gre-
gory S. Dziuban of the Air Force
program said. “High school
graduates have a tough time get-

ting in the services now.” A
“A goal of 500 would be way

too much,” Kolek says in refer-
ence to recruiting. “We set a goal
of about 20. We generally get 20
to 25 recruits.”

Women figure into the
increased enrollment trend in
both the Army and Air Force
ROTC.
women today than there were 15
or 20 years ago, and they're com-
peting in every sense,” Dr.
Nossen said. “They hold their
own very well.”

Women were not even allowed
in the Air Force ROTC until
1970, when there were about 500
nationwide. There has been a
steady increase since then, and
last year, of the 25,505 who par-
ticipated in the program nation-
ally, approximately 4,300 were
women. At Pitt, five of the 21
cadets commissioned into the

_ Air Force last year were women.

Sandy Kiernan, a junior mil-
itary science major and_Ranger
in the Army ROTC, exemplifies
the women’s ability. She quali-
fied for a very competitive air-
borne school at Fort Benning,
Ga., recently. At that camp, she
participated in a number of para-
chute jumps and completed the

same drills required of her male

‘counterparts.

Although women are not cur-
rently permitted to engage in
combat duty, Kiernan believes
that policy may be outdated. “I
don’t think there's any way to
avoid it in today’s military,” she
says, “because no matter where

you're stationed or what yourjob.

or rank you have to be prepared
for combat.” V

Nossen said that the military
has opened several jobs to
women which previously were
restricted to men, and this helps
account for the rise in the
number of women.

The ROTC, in fact, has many
incentives to encourage member-
ship. One of the most obvious is
scholarships, which range from
four to two years. Tony Porreca,
a senior in Army ROTC, admits
that “when I first decided tojoin,

the financial concern weighed

heavily on my mind.”
‘ Captain Swingen believes that
scholarships are more of an

incentive for students at expen-3
sive schools than for those at-

Pitt. Instead, he said, the major
appeal offers outside curriculum
activity and management and
leadership experience.

Honoring A

Movement

Today, the United States Senate will take a ﬁnal
vote to decide whether or not to honor the late Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. by making his birthday a
national holiday.

Yesterday, the Senate defeated by a wide margin a
request by North Carolina senator Jesse Helms to send
the bill back to the Judicial Committee, where it prob-
ably would have died. Helms contends that King was
involvedin communistic activities and wants to open
FBI files to prove that he was. The FBI files on King
.were ordered sealed for 50 years in l977.

It is the hope of many Americans, both black and
white, that the federal government will make King's
birthday a national holiday and be a constant
reminder of freedom without violence. -

Fortunately; the U.S. Senate did not take Helm ’
ramblings about King to heart and did not send the bill
back to committee to die. I

According to a history professor at Pitt, the late J.
Edgar «Hoover was involved in a campaign during the
1960s to try to build a case against King showing that

‘he was a subversive. The professor said that when the

Freedom of Information Act was implemented, it

' showed that many of the charges levelled against King

were false and planted in the files.

It is. our hope that the Senate will vote today to pass
the bill making King’s birthday a national holiday and
that it will get approval by President Reagan.

Many Americans can argue whether or not it is right
to honor King along with George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln, two presidents who helped shape
the nation into what it is today. Although that may be
a valid point_to some, we are not going to argue it here.

We do believe, however, that King should be
honored because of what he stood for, how he went
about getting his views heard and the accomplish-
ments he made. The Civil Rights Movement will live in
the history books as one of the greatest movements in
America. It should be honored and remembered by the
government. _

Nobody can be sure about Helms’ motives behind
his attempts to block the legislation; although specula-
tions have been made, and most /Americans have
formed their own opinions about the senator.

Pennsylvania has been honoring the late civil rights
leader for several years and has experienced no great
problems because of it. It’s about time the rest of the
nation catches up with our state in honoring the princi-
ples of the man and the movement.

Column Has Grain Of Truth

Dear Editor:

At first reading, Chris Bosso’s
article (Pitt News, Oct. 14, I983) is
an amusing satire of academic life at
Pitt. But when examined a little
more closely, the article raises some
disturbing questions concerning the
attitude of graduate students
assigned to teach undergraduates.
Perhaps a cursory examination of
why undergraduates feel compelled
to ask the questions Mr. Bosso has
so conveniently provided “is in order.

(1) Do we have to read the

' assigned books?

Books are expensive,(jokes about
royalties aside). In some cases, they
are not used in the class; in some
other cases, the teacher has not fully

[read the material he or she assigns,

and the book plays only a minor role
in the coursevas a whole.

(2) Are lectures important?

Sometimes, this question is asked
after the student has seen or heard
enough of the lectures that he or she
has some very real doubts as to the
usefulness of even coming to class. I
also suspect that even graduate stu-
dents are susceptible to the same
sorts of problems that plague all of
us on Monday mornings and Friday
afternoons. Indeed, students often
hear complaints (excuses?) in this
regard from the teacher on these
very same occasions.

(3) Do we have to write a paper?

Given the diversity of I teachers
and methods at Pitt, this question

, does not seem unreasonable. Some

of the more serious students would
also like some idea as to the require-

rments of the course so as to plan

their semester accordingly. -
(4) What is on the midterm/ ﬁnal

' exam?

Elli: lﬂitt News 

Given the wide range of material
covered in a given course, it might be
of some help to know what sorts of
general areas will be covered. Mr.
Bosso would like to believe that stu-
dents are dying to give their money

away to know exactly what ques-
tions will be asked, but ‘he would be
fooling himself.

(5) Do we need to take notes?

Mr. Bosso is on a little more firm
ground here, but given some of the
lectures even he has probably had to
attend, taking notes on some lec-
tures can be the sort of chore that
just does not seem worth the effort.

(6) Do spelling and grammar
count on exams? ’

The real ‘meaning behind this

question is: how much -weight does
 

“Satirical as his
‘article is, his com-
ments betray an
insensitivity which
is not only disturb-
ing but dishearten-
ing as well.’’

the teacher place on expression and

style as opposed to the substance
and logic of an answer. Methinks
Mr. Bosso doth protest too much.
(7) Which is more important for
the exam, the book or your lectures?

Again, the issue here is one of

emphasis. In classes where there is
neither rhyme nor reason to the
structure and purpose of the class, it
is often difficult to discern where the
emphasis lies. Perhaps this query
results not from a lack of insight on
the part of the student but an abun-

dance of disorganization on behalf '

of the teacher.
(8) How will you grade exams?
Point to Mr. Bosso. Sometimes
humor, not flattery, will get you by.
(9) Can we come to see you durin
office hours? "

Past E experience in many cases
with ‘a variety of teachers leads one

to believe that as humorous as Mr. V
Bosso’s reply is, it containsrmore

than a grain of truth.
(10) Can we call you at home?
Would Mr. Bosso have students
spare him the courtesy of asking and
simply phone him at the most out-
rageous hour possible?
(I 1) Can we go outside for class?
One gets the feeling that Mr.
Bosso would prefer his undergradu-

ates seen but not heard. Surely he V

would agree that a change of envi-
ronment can do much in preventing
the monotony of classes held in
rooms whoseinterior decorators
were probably commissioned to
design the lavatories at Shea
Stadium. ‘

But what is most disturbing about
all of this is Mr. Bosso’s attitude
toward undergraduates, “particu-

larly freshmen.” His outlook seems _

to be typical of many graduate stu-
dents assigned to teach undergradu-
ates: they forget that they were
undergraduates only a few years
before. It would be nice to think that
Mr. Bosso was so astute and insight-

, ful as an undergraduate that he did

not ask the sorts of “predictable
questions” he posits here.

It is also comforting to know that
his idea for the article came “while
he was . deep in work grading
exams." But it would be even nicer
and more comforting to know that
every now and then, Mr. Bosso took
his head out of the academic clouds
that many graduate students seem to
enjoy residing in and became a little
more sensitive to the needs and ques-

tions of those he teaches. Satirical as

his article is, his comments betray an
insensititvity which is not only dis-
turbing but disheartening as well.

Fan Lets True Opinion
of Philly Hang Loose

By J.P. MARRA

Wish I were back at Penn State‘

writing this one. l’ve got lots of
friends» from Philly there, people
who live, die, brag and drink exces-
sively by the fates of the Philadel-
phia sports teams. I’d love to be
rubbing it in right now. A lot.
Maybe at State’s Homecoming this
coming weekend....

Anyway, if you were outside Sun-
day evening and tilted your head to
the east at approximately 7:30 p.m.,
that whooshing sound you heard
was the sound of tens of thousands
of bottles of champers being slowly,
reluctantly drained into the Schuyl-
kill River. It is my pleasure to reiter-
ate that which you have doubtless
heard -— the Baltimore Orioles,
through the combined efforts of one
of the finer pitching staffs in the free
world, whipped the Philadelphia
Phillies in -the 80th version of the
annual Fall Classic, four games to
one. Whipped them like dogs, I add,
with a twinge of pleasure.-

If I learned anything in Happy
Valley besides how’ to do a beer
bong without ruining my clothes, it
was to despise any sports team that
plays its home games in Philly. See,
I’m a ’Burgher from birth, and those
people hate our teams, so I had no
choice.»lt’s dog-eat-dog in the tube
room, you know. In 1979 and I980,
during a span ofthree months, I had
two chances to celebrate a Pitts-
burgh sports championship. Both
times I was hit by ﬂying debris,
thrown, I am sure, by irate, jealous
Philly rooters. I knew what I had to
do.

I developed this intense dislike for ..

anything remotely associated with
sports and the city of Brotherly
Love. Mind you, I was only recipro-
cating, but I reciprocate well. Some-
times it seemed a bit senseless —— I
yelled myself hoarse rooting for
teams like the Atlanta Falcons, the
Chicago Cubs, the Hartford Whal-
ers, all because they were on TV
playing teams from Philadelphia —
but I did it anyway. All that time
spent in pursuit of my lustful, hate-
ful passion! I could have studied

more, gotten better grades, attended
a more prestigious graduate school

. — oops, sorry. You get the point,

though. Hating Philadelphia teams
soon took up too much of my time.
It was with a profound sense of sad-
ness that I rearranged my list of
priorities, placing my passion back
where it belongs, behind bathing.
But, as absence makes the heart
grow fonder, cheering against the
Phils this past week was great.
McGregor mowing down the Phil-
lies in game five; Murray equaling

his entire hit production in II pre-
vious World Series games with two
towering homers; Morgan tripping
in the third base dirt pit trying to tag
on another Rose out — these are
memories I’lI treasure all my-life.
Watching a tired old bunch of ex-
Reds and -Giants and such, prove
that September was a fluke did this
guy’s, heart a load of good.
Thanks, Baltimore. Have a nice
fall, you guys. Meanwhile, let’s go
Steelers, eh? And how about those
“boys of winter”? The Spirit, too.
And, of course, rah, rah, Pitt.

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Last night started out to be a
peaceful night, as peaceful as any
deadline night at The Pitt News.
After a leisurely dinner in the Tow-
ers cafeteria and a stop in the office,
the assistant news editor and I took
an elevator to the mezzanine.

With $13 million of the students’
money put into the opulent student
union, one would think they’d as
least get an elevator to work right.

The 30-second elevator ride
became a 30-minute ride, thanks to
elevator doors that wouldn’t open.
Half an hour was spent riding up
and down the nine floors ofthe stu-
dent union, stopping at each floor,
opening at none.

After our fingers were sore from

.I.Il.-.

pressing the “Door Open” and

Elevator Ride A Trying Experience

“Alarm” buttons of the elevator
(isn’t there anybody on the other end
of those b ttonsi’), a voice came
from somew ere on the lunar-space-
mode metallic 'walls and asked if we
were still there.

I said no, that we had run out for a

pizza, but I guess I betrayed myself '

by answering.

We joke now how we were lucky
to have come out of it alive, but
joking aside, there is really no excuse
that the elevator situation in the stu-
dent union is in such dire straits.

The money has been spent, and
the surroundings are beautiful. It is a
"building our grandchildren will
undoubtedly visit when they come to
Pitt. So what‘s with the elevators?

The fact that the elevators are ugly
and ruin the building’s ambiance is
one thing, for the purpose of the

J

tin-can look is to prevent graffiti.
Excused.

What is not excused is why, with '-

three elevators, one is usually out of
commission. What is not excused is
that 200 students have to try to pour
in and out of the same elevator in
between classes, thus often making
us late for classes or meetings.
What is not excused is that when

an elevator is finally available (afterv J

the rush hours, ofcourse), I spend 30
minutes sitting. in it with my finger
on the alarm button, yelling to.
unknown voices to “Open the eleva-
tor before I kick the doors in!”
The lesson here, kids, is: -don’t
trust the elevators, get-the exercise
and walk the steps, and question
where your student activities fees go
sometimes. ‘

Editorials Upset Committee Member

Dear Editor:

For the second time in less than a
month, The Pitt News has expressed
an editorial opinion lacking even the
slightest trace of preliminary
research. We all have the right to
express an opinion, but it is always
helpful to" express an educated opin-
ion rather than a haphazard remark.
The Pitt News has unfortunately
consistently chosen the latter.

A few weeks ago, the editors crit-
icized the monopolistic practice of
the university regarding its owner-
ship of the campus book store. Any
attempt to uncover unfair pricing
policies by the university or to offer
any constructive alternatives to the
present situation would be a very
helpful contribution to the student
body. The Pitt News, however,
failed to do either. Research is
simply not the concern of The Pitt
News editorial staff. Did The Pitt
News ever call the book store in an
effort to discover its pricing policies?
The answer is no., I know this
because I called the book store. The

' book store director, Mary Bonach,

 

9 See you favorite sports

referred me to Mr. Joseph Dutton,
vice-chancellor of ' business and
finance. Mr. Dutton was very help-
ful. He gave me the details of the
pricing policy as it pertains to both
hardback and paperback books. If

The Pitt News had compared the
price mark-up at the Pitt book store
with that charged at other book
stores, and found a discrepancy,
then there would be cause for an
editorial. This was not done, the
result being another blemish on the

‘ already tarnished image of The Pitt

News. In comparison to the other
collegiate newspapers I have read,

The Pitt News is certainly the worst. V

If The Pitt News editors had only
put their feet in their mouths once
this term, things wouldn’t be that
bad. Unfortunately, the latest edi-
torial showed an even greater disre-
gard for the facts. The editors main-
tain that “although there hasn’t been
f..yone else who has violated an
elections rule to date, that doesn’t
necessarily mean that the code is
easy to decipher and understand.”

Yes, that is true, and The Pitt News
should have ended its critique at that,
point. The article goes on to read,
“Like most written codes, policies
and constitutions, the election code
is probably difficult to read.” It
doesn’t matter if ‘it is “probably"
confusing, but only if it is confusing.
I can think ofa very easy way to find
out. Maybe, if it wouldn't take too

much time, one of the elite editors of -

The Pitt News could actually read

_<:1 ->45

the code in question. Without read- .

ing the code, the editorial concluded
with the “hope that the elections

committee learnedalesson fromthe , '

whole incident and will work to
make sure it never happens again.”

The code is, in fact, very easy to
read. I know, because I read it and
discussed the incident with the Elec-
tions Committee chairperson,
James Brady. In fact, the date of the
initiation of campaign activities is
on a separate sheet of paper than the‘
general elections code. There is, still
room for human error, and I am sure

that is what happened in the case of _

Ms. Eliason. But for The Pitt News
to evaluate the election code without
ever reading it, is not only irrespon-
sible, but humorous. It is humorous
to those of us who long ago stopped
seriously reading any of the paper's
editorials and began reading them-V
only for_ a laugh. .

I may be overly optimistic, but I7
have not ' given up hope for the

‘ future. So I will “hope that The Pitt - A

News learned a lesson from the
whole incident and will work to _
make sure it never happens again."

Profiles  

[Kathleen /S,

By CHERYL SIRKO

1 Kathleen Peoples knows what
a city that makes its living from

When Dr. Peoples first came to
interview for a job at Pitt, she
expected to find a city much like
her home town of Gary, lnd.
Instead she found the late-
Gothic architecture of the

Cathedral and Heinz Chapel.

“I was very impressed with the
beauty of those buildings,” Peo-
ples said. “I was surprised to find
everything so green and lush.”

The people at Pitt were also

. impressed by what they saw; and

Peoples became a part of its staff
of psychologists and counsellors.
Peoples’ first experience in the

1 field of counselling came work-

ing at »a federal prison, then a
state hospital, then at a phobia
clinic. At that point, she decided
she would rather work with col-
legc students.

“College students ‘are a group

i of people who have the ability to

make meaningful changes in

,.their lives,” Peoples said.

She began that work at East-
ern Michigan University, at
Ypsilanti. There she supervised
graduate students and conducted

Dr. Kathleen Peoples

workshops. Peoples said that
Pitt offered a different kind of
challenge with its varied student
population. Students, however,
share some common problems
wherever they might be, Peoples
said. '

“I don’t see any striking differ-
ences between the students at

Counselor

Pitt and students at other univer-
sities,” she said. “College stu-
dents are like other people -
they have the same problems but
because they are students, they
also have added stress. That
stress can have an adverse affect
on their other problems.”

A large part of Peoples’ work
at Pitt is helping students with
personal problems, including the
problem of~drugs and alcohol
abuse.

“College is usually the first
place most people confront alco-
hol and drugs in an atmosphere
of relative freedom,” Peoples
said. “All students have to front
the decision of whether or not to
use drugs.”

Although she had originally
planned to study linguistics or
German and even considered law
school, her parents stressed the
idea that every college freshman
should take a psychology course.
Realizing how much she enjoyed
it, Peoples took on a psycholo-
gy/German dual major.

Peoples continued her studies
at the University of Michigan
where she obtained her masters
and Ph.D. in clinical psychology.

“I decided‘ I wanted to work
more closely with people,” she
said. .

9 Pride,Prejudice In The Environment

By PAM CYGRYMUS

The environment is a quite recent
discovery, Dr. .I.M.A. Lenihan,
noted physicist and philosopher,
said at a lecture sponsored by the
School of Nursing on Monday.

The lecture, entitled “Pride and
Prejudice, or How to Live With the
Environment,” highlighted ‘two
main “pitfalls” used when dealing
with the environment.

“We tend to assign numbers to
concepts we don’t know well enough
to quantify,” Lenihan said. He
termed this concept “pride in
numbers.” I

' Lenihan supported this idea by
discussing the maximum permissi-
ble levels of toxins in ‘a substance.
He contends that it is the amount of
a toxant absorbed, by the body that
is important, not the amount found
in a substance.

Lenihan also said that chemicals
that are relatively harmless can
become toxic when absorbed by the
body and vice versa.

“When we put a strange chemical
in the body, we don’t know what can
happen,” he said. “It may become
more dangerous or less dangerous.”

Robert E. Olson, M.D.,
Ph.D., associate dean for aca-
demic affairs and professor of
biochemistry and of medicine at
Pitt’s School of Medicine, will be
awarded an honorary doctor of
medicine degree by Chiang Mai
University in Thailand on Wed-
nesday, Oct. 19, in Washington
D.C. The presentation will take
place at the Royal Thai
Embassy, with Kasem S.
Kasemsri, Thai Ambassador to
the United States, presenting the
degree.‘

The degree recognizes Olson’s
achievement in establishing and
directing the Anemia and Mal-
nutrition Center of Chiang Mai
University from‘ 1967-76.

Olson is the editor of Nutrition
Reviews and is currently a

. member of the Advisory Board

of the National Institute of

. Arthritis, Diabetes and Digestive

and Kidney Diseases. He has
been a member of the Food and
Nutrition Board of the National

_ Academy of Sciences since 1967.

the health sciences schools, and
Enid Goldberg, Ph.D., dean of
the School of Nursing.

A graduate of St. Joseph Col-
lege, Nowakowski received her
M.S.N. from the Catholic Uni-
versity of America and com-
pleted her doctorate at the
University of Maryland, School

 
  
  
 

“There is a prejudice that the
equilibrium is the only acceptable
existence for a population or sys-
tem," Lenihan said.

This is not true, according to .-

Lenihan.

“The environment is changing
quite inevitably, and we may or may
not reach another steady state," he
said.’

Another prejudice that distorts
our views about the environment is
“the belief that nature knows best,”
Lenihan said.

He cited the fact that toxic levels
found in organic foods may be much
higher than those found in manufac-
tured foods because such levels are
not permissible in manufactured
products.

This, he said, is also an “example
of the danger of . relying on
numbers.”

Lenihan also said that peopletend
to overestimate small hazards and
underestimate larger hazards. This
presents problems when trying to
calculate “risks" acceptable to those
researching environmental hazards
and those acceptable to the public.

In conclusion, Lenihan said that

i‘Carrots
And Sticks’
Discussed h

By_NANCY POPKIN

The “carrots and sticks” of Yuri
Andropov’s campaign to improve
discipline. in-the Soviet labor force
was the central theme of Friday’s
three roundtable lectures on Labor
in the U.S.S.R. and Yugoslavia,
sponsored by Russian. and East
European Studies.

Dr. Janet Chapman, founding
director of Russian and East Euro-
pean studies and chairman of the
economics department, spoke about
the plan to solve the discipline prob-
lem that is caused by a labor short-
age.-_It is hard for a Soviet worker to
get fired and easy for him to find
another job, and he is given no
incentive to earn more money.

The results are poor attitudes,
tardiness, leaving jobs, drunkenness
on the job and the useof working
hours to go to doctors or to utilize
other ‘ services that are primarily
offered during the working day.

Chapman spoke ofa law that was
passed in August under Andropov’s
efforts to raise productivity and pro-
duction by cracking down on disci-
pline problems and corruption.

The law has the support of the
populous. Its objective is to “take
away carrots as the stick of disci-
pline,” Chapman said.

Under this law, one day of vaca-
tion is taken from every worker who
is three hours tardy or absent from
work. The tardy worker may also be
put on a lesser paying job for three
‘months. If a worker leavesa job
without giving his employer at least
two months notice, he may lose one-
half of his bonus from his nextjob.
All workers are responsible to make
up all service hours and pay for any
damage done on the.job.'Drunken-
ness is punishable by firing.

Conscientious workers can be

rewarded with additional vacation.

days and superior housing for long
service and good behavior under the
same law. l i

As a backdrop to Chapman’s lec-
ture on contemporary Soviet labor,
Dr. William Chase, professor of his-
torv, spoke about Soviet labor prob-
lems in the 1920s. A new economic
policy was targeted at labor prob-
lems that were present in the system
at that time.

It was a two-pronged policy that
paid workers on a piece rate‘ and
called" for the organization of pro-
duction meetings that would involve
workers in production decisions.
The result of the policy was that a
_large number of workers joined the

- party after 1924.

The third speaker, Dr. Arnold
Katz, professor of economics, spoke
about current problems in the
Yugoslavian economy. He said that
too much money is put into.invest-
ment. In some years, 40 percent of
the gross national‘ product is
invested. Unemployment is a prob-
lem that has been aggravated by a
mass movement of the population
into the cities. Inﬂation is caused by
poor agricultural production.

The roundtable lectureswere part
of a series that marks the‘ 15th anni-

hversary of the University Center for

Running Game Amassing Consistency

By MARK A. SINDLER

A lot of Pitt football players are
talking resurgency these days. It is
not a lot of hot air.

After reeling off a couple of victo-
ries at season’s start, two losses by a
total of nine points let the morale
out of the balloon. Depression was
as evitable as sand on wet feet.

The Panthers were making mental
mistakes like cars come off an
assembly line. This was no oppor-
tune time to break in a sophomore

quarterback against swarming bee-

  

hives of teams labelled Maryland
and West Virginia.

Sure, the defense was doing its .

job. Nothing less would be expected,

but football teams do not find liveli- ,

hood by relying on one unit. There
are better ways to score/points.
Yet in the wake of breaking in that
second-year QB, John Congemi,
there was no safeor sound reliance
on other teammates in the backﬁeld.
In fact, forget that Pitt won its
first two games with Tennessee and
Temple.'Seems that ghosts rented
space in that backﬁeld. Pitt's run-
ning ame plain lacked luster.

The tandem of Marc Balley (21) and Chuck Scales has come on strong '07 Pm 33

A star is slowly in the making. Alan Wenglikowski, whose dad is a starting defensive end, takes in
Saturday night festivities at Louisville in a game Pitt won handily 55-10

  

“At first we were. growing and
maturing,” Pitt backfield coach
Andy Urbanic said.

That, at the expense of a ground
attack that glowed with predictabil-
ity. Teams early on knew what to
expect — close to nothing.

After the Tennessee affair, first

off, tailback Joe McCall emerged 4

with bruised ribs and a couple weeks
later pulled a calf muscle. All along,
the 6-1 , 190-lb. early-season favorite
to carry the load, dragged tearful
stats. Fourteen‘ yards against the
Vols and 45 in the Temple game gave
him a 2.1 average. '

What an ovation fo-r\the All—East
candidate, who missed Maryland
with the leg ailment. Of course, his
counterparts were not stinging
opposing defenses either. Fullback
Marlon McIntyre did plow through
the line with a 5.9 average after two
games and did accumulate l24
yards.

But everything was not in order.
The Terps held four Pitt rushers to
157 yards with Mclntyre and
another fullback, Marc Bailey, pick-
ing up the most.

Tailback Darnell Stone came
away with the most against West
Virginia (45), starting then in place
of McCall. But this bundle ofsopho-
more hope was shortlived when he
broke his wrist in the game. He will
be out for three more weeks.

There it was after four games: 606
total rushing yards. And the longest
single run was tailback Chuck
Scales’ 2 l-yardjaunt on his first col-
legiate carry and TD against the
Mountaineers.

Urbanic still did not have any
potential_break-away runners or one
or two people to count on for heavy
production.

Funny, though, what a difference

two games can make. That was espe-.

cially true the following week when

> ,Pitt tried its hand against Florida

State. The vice-like grip choked off
the Seminoles.

In its first home game in three
weeks, Pitt and Joe McCall ‘averted
a losing record when the senior came
back from the trainer’s table and
spent the game’s last eight and a half
minutes running 12 defense-stifling,
off-tackle plays.

His 96 net yards then were com- _'

plemented by Bailey's 33, not
extraordinary in itself, only that he "
carried three times. Scales also
started his second game in a row and
was still alive afterward. with 51 ,
yards on 16 carries (after two
games). 1

If the FSU production was some-
thing to glower over then that
stumbled across _ last weekend
deserved something nearing a
medal.

McCall, a fully healed one at that,
again rushed for 96 yards, Bailey for
42, Scales for 76. That all amounted
to 284 total rushing yards ——, Pitt's
seasonal best. ‘ V

Granted, Louisville is more akin
to the sandlot team down the street,
but this was also the second week in
a row that Urbanic had a solid unit
that recovered from‘ its earlier-
diagnosed inexperience.

“I know coaches have alluded to
us as young,” Urbanice said, “but
with McIntyre and McCall — the
only tested ones — we began with
young kids. Some were playing
more than we would have like them.

“But they came along’ due to
[other] injuries.” ‘

One of Urbanic’s keys is still
injured — Stone. But the rest of,his
“youngsters" are ready for five
games that are overly relevant to
Pitt's closing record. The running
game finally seems to be falling into
place. .

Scales, for one, showed V his
Parade All-Americarstuff after tak-
ing hit upon hit from the.Seminoles.
Bailey, off of a redshirt year, is also a
definite cog. '

Bailey's Dedication Pays Off  

By CHARLIE O’!-I-IARA

As a four year basketball letter-
man at Saint Elizabeth High School
in Pleasant Hills, Pa., where he
played power forward, Tom Bailey
never set foot on a cross country
trail, let alone the track oval.

Today, Bailey, a senior captain, is
ﬁnishing up his fourth season as a
member of the Pitt men's cross
country team.

“I wasn’t recruited at all in high
school to run,” he said. “I just ran to
keep in shape. I had no idea when I
came to Pitt that I would be running
for them.

“I was more concerned with hav-
ing something to do. So I decided to
run. I didn’t know what I was in for."
g Bailey.was forced to make a tran-
’siton_ from high school basketball

‘ practices consisting of, for the most

part, a steady diet of sprints to 75
miles pv 1 week of difficult long-
distanca workouts.

“I was very surprised by the
amount of work involved," the eco-
nomics major said. “There is a defi-
nite difference in discipline. It takes

' a whole lot more of it to run colle-

The Pitt News, ‘Wednesday, October 19, I983

giate cross country. In high school
basketball, it’s a lot less time-
consuming."

To the 1983 team, he has exempli-
fied consistency not only to the new-
comers but also to the seasoned
veterans. Despite the fact that the
team will compete in only three
meets, Bailey’s determination has
been ever-apparent.

“Every day, he runs with every-
thing he has," Panther coach John
Vasvary said. “He’s not the most tal-
ented guy in the world. He beats
people with guts and strength. He’s
been willing to work hard since I got
here last year. While most of the
team was participating in track, he
was putting in the 75- to 95-mile
weeks and lifting on Tuesdays and
Thursdays every week.

“It’s great to have a guy like Tom
Bailey in your program. He makes a
great contribution, especially for the

young guys.”
Throughout his collegiate career,

Bailey has been a part of the resur-
gence of Pitt track and cross coun-

try, though the cross country part is,

taking a bit more time.

“Before Coach Vasvary came,
cross country was more the time that
the track guys got in shape for the
indoor and outdoor seasons," he
said. “But since Vasvary has been
here, he has shown some real deter-
mination and dedication to the
team.

“The freshmen he has here this
year have great potential. For Bill
[Moorhead], Todd [Colas] and
myself, we've been trying to help
with making the transition for the
younger guys possible. We’ve kind
of initiated them into the program.
In that respect, it’s fun."

The fact that the team has partici-
pated in only two meets prior to Big
East championships (to be held this
Saturday, Oct. 22,'at Boston Col-
lege) makes it tough mentally to pre-
pare for competition. Without
havi the true race experience
under their belts, it is difficult to
foresee a great performance.

“It’s hard to improve wﬁh so
much space between the meets,” Bai-
ley said. “We’re all working very
hard to improve on our times, but

Reck New Champion

By MARGARITA ‘ELLEN

On the Pitt campus, one can find
many champion athletes, both male
and female.‘ But there are some

“greats which go unnoticed. Sopho-

more Dick Reck is one of them.

Reck recently won the Pennsylva-
nia state championship in racquet-
ball in the l8-and-under division.
His “official” title is State Junior
Champion. The title was earned at
the High Point Racquetball Club in
Chalfont, just outside of
Philadelphia.

The Bethel Park native has been

playing since the age of'l2, when his

family joined Off The Wall, one of
the first racquetball clubs opened in

ﬁthe area. Reck acquired a job at the
7 club, giving him unlimited access to

the courts — essential to become an
above average player and
competitor.

By winning states, Reck qualified
himself for both the regional and
national racquetball tournaments.
In April, he will take the challenge at
regionals. I

“Reck is one of the __up-and-

‘Looming young stars in our state,”
-' said Lou Fabian, president of the

Pennsylvania Racquetball Associa-
tion and Pitt intramurals director.
“He’s one of the better athletes
and physical specimens competing
in racquetball. He has an excellent
‘forehand and is an excellent

retriever; qualities that are very.

important for winning.”
Pennsylvania produces some of-

the best racquetball players (on the

East Coast, and many of those

champions are from/the Pittsburgh

area.
“Some of the best in the state are

from around here,” Reck. said. “It ’_

gives me the opportunity to compete
against some of the top, players.”

Reck stressed that it is important
to get playing time with better play-
ers. Two such people are Al
Plummer, a former state champion,
finishing second this‘ year in the state
tourney and Rich Zewe, a former
Pitt student.

“One of the reasons why I like
racquetball is that it is fairly easy to
learn and fairly easy to get good at to
a point,” explained the 19-year-old
champion. “After you reach that
point, it's very hard to get better.
You have to have the competition to

~ir_npr'ove yourself.

“I'm lucky because I get to play
against the better players like

Plummer, so I excel faster in the

sport. The_better the person that you

“Racquetball had it’s biggest
spurt two years ago, when clubs
started opening all over,” Reck said.
“But now it's not growing as much

Rupp’s Transfer Asset For Lady Spikersi

By LAURIE KUBLI

Coach Shelton Collier broke tra-
dition when he acquired setter Cathy
Rupp from Ohio University. Rupp
is not the first Ohioan to set foot on
Pitt turf, but she is the first one for
whom Pitt's women’s volleyball
team restructured its entire offensive
strategy.

“For about seven years, Pitt used
the 5-! offense," Collier said, “which
is pretty standard in collegiate vol-
leyball.” The 5-] setup utilizes only
one setter, and the five represents the
number of spikers.

“We developed a new offense to
best utilize her talent, because she is
also an outstanding spiker," Collier
explained.

The new offense, the 6-2, has
Rupp setting alonside team captain
and setter Judy Young. This forma-
tion increases the number of possi-
ble spikers (including one of the
setters), a facet that greatly enhances
the Lady Panthers’ability to confuse
the opposition.

“I‘m very pleased with the way
that’s worked out," Collier said.

By transferring, Rupp lost a year
of playing time and many class cred-
its, but the spiker does not regret her
decision, which was based on the
volleyball program at Pitt, as well as
her major.

Administration of justice was a
vague area at Ohio,” Rupp said.

“That, and the fact that the volley-
ball team here at Pitt is far better —
I'd rather be playing Top 20 teams.”
The setter had also considered Penn
State and Ohio State before settling
on Pitt.

Rupp says she had to give a lot of
thought to her decision, _but cites the
benefits of going to classes and prac-
ticing with the team for a season
before actually competing in
matches.

“I had to question the loss ofcred-
its and playing time when I trans-
ferred, but I improved so much last
year because I wasn't competing for
a position," Rupp commented.

The junior setter, who now must
attend classes a ﬁfth year to obtain a
degree in administration of justice,
explained how it feels to be a
transfer student: “A lot of times
transfers aren’t welcome — people
ﬁgure you still have loyalties at your
old school, but the volleyball pro-
grams at Pitt and Ohio U. don't
compare,” she remarked. “I started
all over, and adapted to —Shelton’s
philosophy.”

Observed Collier, “On our team,
Cathy is what you would call a
leader by example. She is not a ‘rah-
rah’ type leader but can be very
effective because she is physically
capable of making outstanding
plays.”

Rupp maintains that she did not
have the responsibilities in high

  

   

  

school that she has now; she was the
team setter and had no defensive
duties or picking tough spikes offthe
ﬂoor. ‘

The native Ohian was not happy
with her high school volleyball days,
and asserts that some residue from
those tough times lingers. ‘_‘I had a
problem with my coach — she
would play down any accomplish-
ments I made, and I'm still fighting
that.” Rupp said. “But the desire is
still there [to play].“

This summer the spiker travelled
to the Rocky Mountains and Latin
America to compete on the Athletes
In Action all-star team, whose
members are selected on the recom-
mendations of coaches. The team
trained two weeks at Colorado State
University and played for four
weeks in South America.

i, Rupp said that in those four

weeks, the team played every night.

but one. Playing right side front and
right side back, positions which the
spiker didn’t usually play, had a tre-
mendous effect on her development
and improvement.

Collier contends that Rupp’s
improvement has not stopped there.
“It’s exciting to work with Cathy
because every week she seems to
improve or learn something new,

whether it be on defense, blocking,

hitting, or whatever.
“This , season Cathy has been
developing. right on schedule asra

setter and a spiker, until the Pitt
Classic.”

On September I6, Pitt took on
and defeated Florida State, then
ranked l9th, in the team’s biggest
victory of the season. _

"Cathy had an outstanding
match, and in the very next match
(the next day against Louisville), she
went down with an ankle injury and
was out for three weeks,” Collier
lamented.

Rupp’s development had come to

an abrupt halt, but Collier contends 
that his setter is ready for action.‘ ’

“Now, Cathy and the rest of the
team are preparing for the stretch
drive, before the Big East
tournament.” _ _

After a disappointing perfor-
mance at the Pitt Invitational this
weekend, Rupp maintains that the
players have their work cut out for

' them in pulling together and reas-

serting their volleyball authority.

For me and a lot of people on the
team, we have to become more

intense,” the setter explained. ‘‘We-»:.

see the work we have to do, and

we’ve seen how well we can play.

“Injuries set us back, and ourcon-
fidence was blown last weekend. We
may have difficulty «re-establishing
ourselves, but with a lot of hard
work and determination we can do
it.”

P7” One way not to prepare for a ten-

nis conference championship is to
get beat in the last three matches by a
combined score of 25 to 2. Lady
Panther tennis coach George Dief-
fenbach, however, believes the com-
petition Pitt faced last weekend will
benefit the squad going into the Big
East championship this Friday.
Both Georgetown and Allegheny
shut out Pitt 9-0, while the Lady
Panthers managed to take two
matches from Villanova. But Dief-
fenbach stresses the good points of

¢..these quality teams, especially judg-
“ -“ing from the last place finish in 1982,

when Pitt did not win a match.

“Last year, we had a great team
record (8-2), but we didn’t give the
team exposure to good competi-
tion,” he said. “As a result, we were
surprised at the level of competition
in the Big East tournament.

“Our schedule this year is vastly
improved. We have matches with six
Division I schools. We went against

‘L the best.”

The best, however, was too much
for Pitt. Against Georgetown last
Saturday, only No. 2 player Miriam
Goltz managed to send a match into
three sets, losing to Teresa Elwood
6-2, 4-6, 6-2. With the exception of
No. 6 player Rhonda Gibbs’ 7-5
second-set loss to Robin Antonicci,
the Lady Panthers were not even
close in the seven other matches.

“The matches weren’t as lopsided

 as the scores indicated,” Dieffen-

bach said. “I was pleased with the
play of Miriam; Rhonda performed
well, and the doubles teams were
respectable."

In the Villanova match, wins by

the lower—seeded players kept Pitt
away from a second straight blank-
ing. Jenny Leach, the Lady Panth-
ers’ ﬁfth-seeded player, defeated
Julie Spinnler in straight sets, 7-6
(7-3 in the set tiebreaker) and 6-1.
Later, Leach combined with Gibbs
to win at No. 3 doubles in three sets.

In the Allegheny match, resched-
uled from last‘ Wednesday, Pitt was
missing Goltz, out with an undis-
closed illness, and No. 4 player Jody
Mattioli, who sat out the match due
to prior academic commitments.

“There was no way we could have
won the math,” Dieffenbach said.
“But I wanted to give the players
some more experience.”

Now, all that _remains for the 1983
season in this weekend’s tourna-
ment. The goal of finishing with an

. even record was taken care of deci-

9 sively with the last four matches, but

improving in the Big East .could
make this season much better for
Dieffenbach.

“We were two matches away from
a winning season,” he said. “We lost
to West Liberty State and Indiana
by 5-4. These matches literally went
down to the last shot.

“But the team has improved in the
process, and we are coming to the
ultimate part of the season — the Big
East." ,

The doubles teams of Goltz-

’ Levine and Leach-Gibbs are Pitt‘s

major chance of advancing into the
latter rounds, while Levine and
Leach could move on into the singles
bracket.

As with most tournaments, the
pairing will have a critical effect on
the team’s success. One advantage
the tournament has over last year —
particularly for Pitt — is a consola-
tion bracket, which keeps a player in

ference championship course, IS

ing both his time and the team ﬁnish.
The team finished a disappointing
eighth place in the nine-team
conference. ‘

“Realistically, I can’t see us win-

ball clubs. Successful competitors
are invited by clubs to play on their
courts, and top players are often
overly accomodating in playing
against such competition.

When he is not at one of the local
clubs, Reck can be found at the
Trees Hall courts. He usually gets
people to come in and play, but he
occasionally plays with someone
from Pitt. Last year, he even put a
classified ad in a paper to find a
competitor.

At one time, Pitt had a club team
that competed in a regular league. It
had some of the top racquetball
players in the area playing on the

squad. Reck would like to see some-
thing like that return.

“It would be really nice to get 10
or 12 people together,” Reck said.
“We could meet once or twice a week
and play round robin. We could

even try to get into a league. It’s '

good to get some different
competition." '

Racquetball is a special part of
Reck’s life, and as a business admin-
istration major, he sees the possibil-
ity of being the manager and pro at a
family-owned health and racquet-
ball club in the future. In the mean-
time, Reck will continue to compete
and be a success in a unsung sport.

Our plans were to take the Park-

way (279) to I-79 south, to I-7_0 west, ,

to I-270 south,and then finally I-71
south to Louisville.

The troubles, or the trip however
it be described, began on Parkway
West near the Greentree exit, when
we discovered that the van did not
take kindly to climbing hills. It auto-
matically decelerated to 15 miles per
hour. _

'1 he cynics, all of us, began con-
templating aloud whether the quest
in which we found ourselves was
meant to be.

We made it to I-79. It was basi-
cally downhill for a while, enabling
us to gain some mileage. The
thought that the misfortunes were
left behind on the Parkway disap-
peared as we were forced to pull over
to the side of the road due to lack of
power.

It was 10 a.m., and we were nine
miles from Washington, Pa. when
we arrived at a Boron station with
the hopes that the service attendant
could mend this wounded heap.

referred to him, replaced the fuelifil-

ing, figured he could put the screws
to us for a couple bucks, and we
would be on our merry way.

He was right. He didjust that. As

Collier asserts that his setter’s
strength lies in her athletic versatil-
ity. “Cathy is the most talented all-
around athlete _we have on our
team," he remarked. “She has a
wealth of physical attributes and I
think she has the potential to be a
top-notch volleyball player.

“What's exciting about working
with her is that right now, she is_a
good volleyball player, but because
of her outstanding physical attrib-
utes, she still has the ability do
develop further."

“The sky's the limit,” Rupp
asserted. “I treasure my natural abil-
ity and the confidence Shelton has
instilled in me. The only thing that
holds me back is the mental aspect,
which is the toughest part to
overcome.

“I worry about the team,” Rupp
continued, “and my performance,"
but Collier believes that it is one of
the keys to her improvement.

The setter agreed. “Yes, I've
matured a lot in that respect,” Rupp
said. “You can ask my mom and
dad. I used to get down on myself,
but it has developed into intensity on
the court.

Asked if transferring has chaged
her style, Rupp responded, "I am
two totally different players (at Ohio
U. and Pitt). I’ve always has some
natural ability, but I never really
pushed myself, and my previous
coaches didn't. Shelton has made me
more of an intense player. That's

something I’ve been going through.

and Marlon, but we have to consist-
ently put the ball where we can win.”

Urbanic’s backshave amassed six
rushing TDs after six games.

“The running game is a very

A involved thing,” Urbanic continued.

{‘\“We ran into a couple teams, and it

/ takes time and cohesion for the run-
ning backs and line to come
together. You also have to consider
multiple schemes that may take a
while to learn.”

Often, Bailey says now, some of
that orientation may have come off
as mistakes.

“We are trying to eliminate mis-
takes from our vocabulary,” he said.
“I”made a couple mistakes at Louis-
ville, and those will stick with me
through the week. Come Saturday,
it will be in the back of my mind."

“Working and practicing tend to
make you a better team,” Urbanic
said of his little team. “I was pleased
with the Louisville performance,
though we did make mistakes. We’re
becoming a veteran football team
more quickly. —

“Though the stats are -not great,
we are getting good yards per carry."

Promising is more to the point.
McIntyre is averaging five per carry,
followed by Bailey’s 4.8, McCall’s
4.1 and Scales’ 4.1. ' '

After the first four games, to think
that the running game came this far

with what composed it at fall camp is .

closeto surprising.

“The inconsistency’ was that we
had young people at first,” Urbanic
r\emarked. “They had to get to know
each other and get the job done.
We’re just beginning to see a better
offensive game emerge."

Bailey believes that yesterday’s
losses will somehow equate with
tomorrow's victories.

“We're all trying to strive for con-
sistency,” he said. “We were knock-
ing on the door, and now we’re ready
to kick it in and move the ball
consistently.

“It's been a great year for me per-
sonally. I think you learn from your
mistakes, and we have come back
the last two weeks; people now real-
ize the capability of the offense and

that will show against Navy [Satur- ‘

day] and in the coming weeks.” 8'

continued from page sixteen
Pa. we decided to scrap the junker

and search for a rental outﬁt. It was

nearing l l. _
After breaking at Burger King for

L 20‘cheeseburgers and a "two-liter

coke, we first tried Hertz. Then Avis.

“No dice.

“How about the Chevy dealer
over on the interstate?,” the Avis
mechanic offered.

We fell for that one, too. Needless
to say, never go totWashington, Pa.
on a weekend if you need to rent a
car.

Disgruntled to say the least, we
coasted from the streets of Washing-
ton, hoping that the van had enough
lelt to make it to Wheeling, W.Va.,
where, we figured, there had to be a
rent-a-car somewhere.

After a nix from the Dodge
dealer, we found an Avis in the yel-

~ low pages. We made it to the Avis _

outﬁt by l2:l0-.

Despite the fact that the Chevy
Impala station wagon‘had not been
washed, we took it for $53 a day and

' no additional cost for mileage,

which was perhaps a silver lining.

. lhe Pitt News, Wednesday, October 19, 1983

Fearand Loathfifng In Louiisvi//e

- After signing the neccessary pap-
ers, Ron, the Avis attendant who
wished to remain surnameléss,
informed us that we had 368 miles to
go. Music to the ears? Right.

We piled in and shoved off at
l2:20, figuring that ifwe made good
time, we could be on time at least for
the game, but in the same breath
realized we still had quite a long haul
ahead.

I-70 was accomplished in about
two hours, with Hanlon reassuring
all of us countless numbers oftimes
that we would make it. It seemed
that his was the lone positive
attitude. '

We were all ready for anything. It
did not take much. because we had
almost been through everything that
could go wrong in one morning.

- We were not to be disappointed
for a good while, it seemed. The spir-
its were definitely changing. Just
prior to passing the Jack Nicklaus
tennis center and , Kings Island
amusement park, a sign appeared
telling us that it was only 200 miles
to our destination.

A great feeling to know that we
were only going to be in the car for
another three and half hours. It was
about a 2:45, and we figured 6:15
would be the arrival time. '

Conversation, meanwhile, had
just about died, so we turned on the
AM radio for some “entertain-
ment.” We were entertained for a
minimal amount oftime, listening to
college football telescores. Football
bettors, in most cases, call in and ask
for scores from around theicountry.

At approximately 5, we crossed
the Kentucky border. There were
quite a few oddities in this state.
How about a state park named “Big
Bone Lick State Park"? What is
done for recreation here, I won-
dered, as did my travelling compan-
ions.

' Following a battle with traffic, we
had made it. We picked up /our
passes at_ the press gate, and the
catastrophe had ended. It had been
l0 long hours of insanity to cover a
Pitt whitewash. How rewarding.

What a weekend!
