LSAT Prep
Course Offered

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

After much work on the part of .

Student Government Board
members, a Law School Admissions
Test (LSAT) preparatory class has
been instituted as part of the
CAS / CGS curriculum on a one year
trial run.

The course is offered through
Showmaker-Kusko, Inc. and will
consist of 32 hours of study for stu-
dents who will be taking the LSAT.
The course will be conducted/in a
room in the student. union over a
five—day period, Sept. 18-25, for
those planning to take the LSAT on
Oct. 1.

“I believe that it’s very important
right now because of the competitive
nature of the exam,” board member
Mindy Goldberg said. “Having
preparation gives you an advantage
over other students.”

The biggest obstacle to the
course’s implementation so far was
the price, according to Goldberg.
Most institutions offer the course
for $275 to $375. The Allentown-
based Shoemaker-Kusko offers it at
only $100 per student, which will be
paid by the student.

“The whole thing was to get a
course that was inexpensive
enough,” Goldberg said.

The price includes instruction by a

‘lawyer or law student who has

already taken the exam, class mate-
rials and a complete tape library,
located in Hillman Library.

The introductory class will be held
on September 11 at 7 p.m. in Dining
Room A of the William Pitt Union.
Although she does not know exactly
how many students have signed up
for the class, Goldberg expects
attendance to be between 25 and 50
students.

“If this program proves to be suc-
cessful,” she said, “SGB hopes to
institute similar classes for all gradu-
ate courses in which a student must»
pass a test to enter.”

SGB president
agrees. . , 

“We are not just trying to get these
-courses for people who are inter-
ested in going to law school,” Downs
said. “In the coming months. we

would like to build upon this and get
some other types of prep courses.”

In other SGB business, benches
will be placed at the campus bus stop
later this fall. ‘

The SGB is also working on the
grand opening party for the William
Pitt Union tonight. They are spon-
soring the party, which will have
entertainment by The Flashcats and
comedian Tom Parks.

Arms Race Study Group Expands Program

By PEGGY seam

The Pitt Arms Race Study Group
is looking to expand its local con-
tacts and become more involved in
active lobbying efforts. Student par-
ticipation, however, has been a
problem.

Members of the group say they
are not certain why there has been a
low level of student involvement in
the past, but work has begun to plan
d'scussion topics and increase the
group’s visibility.

The group, which began in 1981,
is primarily an educational study
group involved with examining all
questions and aspects associated

with the arms race. The group’s liter-.

ature refers to this education as a
form of action to inform people
about public policy and nuclear war
as a means of prevention. The group
holds no specific political or reli-
gious views and remains open to the
ideas of its members.

Study group president Diane
Hernon-Chavis said she is optimistic
that the group can expand its activ-
ity and attract more student partici-
pation as a result.

“We [in the group] are not work-
ing alone,” Hernon-Chavis said. The
study group, she explained, main-
tains contact with many groups in
the Pittsburgh area, and is able to

.. . - .draw.ffror'n.the resources of such '

organizations as the Thomas Mer-
ton Center.

“I see us getting more of a reputa-
tion,” she said. “People have begun
to know who we are, and so I see us
having more campus visibi1ity.”'She
emphasized that she would like to
see students more involved, but
added that she was encouraged by
the response of freshmen to the
group and its ideas during freshman
orientation.

The summer break was a busy
time for the group. Among its activi-
ties, it participited with many other
Pittsburgh peace groups on many
projects and sent representatives to
Washington, D.C. to commemorate
the 20th anniversary of Martin
Luther King’s “I have a dream”
speech. It also invited speakers to
address a wide range of topics from
space-age weaponry to the presenT
situation in Honduras.

This October, the group will join
with others to support an organized
lobbying effort against the station-
ing of first-strike weapons (Pershing
II and cruise missiles) in Western
Europe. Members will man tables in
the Forbes Quadrangle where stu-
dents can sign petitions and meet to
lobby at the Federal Building.

The group has always sponsored
noontime discussions of issues relat-
ing to the arms race and will con-
tinue this term to expand the range
of topics.

The first in the series, which beg-
ins this Tuesday at noon in the Eng-
lish department, deals with Vietnam
verterans. It is entitled “Vietnam
Combat Veteran’s Reactions to
Wartime Experience and Civillian
Life.”

According to Assistant Professor
of Administrative Justice Erich
Vierthaler, who plans the lecture
schedule, topics will include the bas-
ing of Allied missiles in the Ural
mountains, the development of the
Soviet arms race, and non-violent
alternatives.

Also being considered, Vierthaler
said, is the possibility of inviting stu-
dents to give talks based on papers
they have written which relate to the
arms race. . ‘

The visibility of the group and its
activities are important, Vierthaler
said. “We should have an educated
citizenry," he explained. “Education
is for informed action.”

Elizabeth Segel, a lecturer in the
English department and member of
the group, said artistic expression

such as poetrv can also play a part,
One project in the works is holding
short story and poetry readings.

“Artists can distill the truth some-
times,” Segel explained. “Some-
times they have something to say (in
their works) that is different from
what the expert has to say and we
need to listen!’ _ . .- .. .- ~  -

The group also plans to show
films and hopes to have a series on
first-strike weapons and missiles in
Western Europe, she said.

“We don’t have any feeling that
we have exhausted our supply of
speakers or topics,” Segel added.

Most speakers are Pitt professors,
but some individuals such as
members of the West German peace
movement or retired officers have
been invited to give their
perspectives.

To many writers, winning the
Pulitzer Prize would be the
dream of a lifetime. To Galway
Kinnell, however, it “wasn’t
really anything special.”

Kinnell is Pitt’s newest Visit-
ing Mellon Professor in English
and said the experience of win-
ning the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for
poetry was “pleasant.” Kinnell
won the prize for his book
“Selected Poems.”

Kinnell, a native of Rhode
Island, has seen much of the
world through various teaching
positions. He has taught at the
University of Grenoble in France
and the University of Teheran in
Iran, as well as American schools
in Chicago, New York and
Hawaii.

In addition to the Pulitzer,
Kinnell won the 1975 Award of

Merit Medal for Poetry from the

Pulitzer Prize Winning
Poet Teaches At Pitt

American Academy of Arts and
Letters. His book of poetry,
“Mortal Acts, Mortal Words,”
received high critical praise when
it was published in I980.

Before coming to Pitt, Kinnell
was the director of the creative
writing program at New York
University, a position to which
he will return after he leaves the
university in December.

Kinnell is no stranger to Pitts-
burgh. He taught at the univer-
sity in the early '70s and has even
written a poem entitled “Good-
bye” that mentions the city sev-
eral times. In March of 1982,
Kinnell was one of the featured
speakers at the revival of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Writers’
Conference.

This term, he is teaching a poe-
try class and a workshop for

VideoMusic:singisaeiieing 

By DAN HALL

‘‘I want my MTV.” This adver-
tising slogan for Music Televi-
sion has been voiced by millions
of Americans since MTV first
aired in August of 1981. Today,
this 24-hour cable television sta-
tion boasts fourteen and a half
million subscribers in the United
States.

Largely due to the success of
MTV, it has become increas-
ingly clear that as 455 were in the
’60s and albums in the ’70s,' rock
vidoes are the wave of the ’80s.

For the uninitiated, MTV’s
programming features mainly
top 40 heavy metal and new
wave videos. Following in its
wake, have been CMTV, the
country music equivalent, and
several top 40 video shows on
commercial television, such as
NBC’s “Friday Night Videos.”
These video songs range from
in-concert clips to expensive,
expertly produced mini-ﬁlms.

MTV and other video stations
have proven to be an immeasur-
able boost to many new bands
trying to make a name in the
United States.

“In those two years we’ve
been on the air, we’ve exposed a
lot of new music to the country,”
said Sue Binford, director of pro-
gram publicity at MTV.

“Rock-n-roll listeners have
been exposed to a whole new
group of artists,” she said.

Groups like Bow Wow Wow,
Duran Duran and Men At Work

have watched their videos play a

large part in their commercial
success, and a- survey by the
Nielsen Home Videolndex done
last fall showed that eight out of
10 young adult viewers had
heard of some artist for the first
time on MTV and more than six
out of 10 had purchased an
album by an artist seen on MTV.

The survey also indicates that
nearly seven out of 10 young
adult and teen viewers consider
MTV important —— Very Impor-
tant -— in helping to decide on
album purchases. .

Binford said she has watche
rock videos evolve from basic
concert clips to “conceptual
videos, where there are a lot
more special visual techniques.
Videos have become much
more sophisticated.”

In the Oakland area, video

-music seems to be popping up

everywhere. Bars and fraternity
houses. have made good use of it
for entertainment, and -rock
videos can be seen at some area
discos.

A large-screen television
tuned exclusively to MTV was
recently installed at Oasis
Records on Forbes Avenue, and
'Corky’s Restaurant ‘on Fifth
Avenue also turns its screen to
MTV eachnight.

“We get a lot of regulars who
come in to watch MTV,” said
Corky’s assistant manager
Mark Hogenmiller.

“We’re getting a real good
response to it here,” said Oasis
manager Ted Arnold.

Arnold said people have
begun to come into Oasis just to

was added to the playlist. Bin-
ford said the" video was cut
somewhere down the line before
it reached MTV — probably by
the record company that pro-
duced it. ~

While MTV does not havela
censorship policy, Binford said,
“we have an obligation to cable
operators around the country.
We are programming to a
national audience, and we have
to make sure that what we put
on MTV meets community
standards of taste.” -

A-storm of controversy also
arose earlier this year over the
videos of Rick James, a noted
black performer whose five
videos were denied airtime on
MTV. James claimed this was

. because of his race, but MTV

said the videos were not
released because they weren’t
rock-n-roll. /

“[They] would not work in our

format,” Binford said. “They’re

not rock-n-roll. It’s not a ques-
tion of color, which Rick James
was contending. We program
according to the music, and we
don’t care if the performer is

green or yellow or brown.”

Despite some of the issues
that have, been stirred by the
“China Girl” and Rick James
incidents, the emergence of
video music has caused a new
craze with young people
throughout the country, and
they keep on rocking to music
they can not only hear but see.

Welcome to
1983  

Some Ivy League universities will stick totheir guns
and exhibit an amazing ability to recognize the need
for change and ignore the need forchange at the same
time. Butthe ‘traditional. acceptance o_f'de1iying college
admission to women‘ because they are ‘women ‘isgnow
behind us-at last; a

How big.it was of Columbia ‘Colleg'"e,i.the undergrad-
uate school of Columbia 1Jniv'er,si_ty,‘-to allow women
to" enter its doors and -become the last great‘Ivy.League
school to surrender to progress. ’

Columbia, however, should not be congratulated on
its decision‘;-. rather, it should be condemned" for the
archaic academic ‘attitudes that have stubbornly per-
sisted'to this day. What is even more amazing than this
blatant disregard for educational 0PPQrtunities for
women is the fact that many educators stood in oppo-
sition to Colum_bia’s long overdue decision. " _

In‘ spite. of the progress made. i__n._ recent years to
assure ‘that women are taken seriously ‘in a university;
setting and allowed to- partake of ‘all the'..opport1inities
formerly available to men, discrimination purely on
the basis of sex has persisted. .  -. ,

. Women have come quite a way, but they ‘still: have a
long way to go. But, as Ms. editor Gloria Steinern once‘
pointed out when ‘she was addressing Pittsburgh exec-
utive women on the subject of carceréadvancement, if
women are really accepted as -serious adults‘ today,
why does the whole phrase read “you’ve come a long
way, BABY”? Judging by the almost self-
congratulatory announcement that women are now
(finally) to be admitted to all Ivy League schools, the .

' phrase would be more realistic, and sadly more truth-
ful, if it read “you've come a long way...maybe.”

Women would be uncharacteristically optimistic to.
believe that their problems are over now. The fact that
they are allowed in certain universities is no guarantee
-that they will be admitted. ‘They still have to- meet
certain standards and present themselves as always
more serious, intelligent and dedicated than their male
counterparts to be accepted. They are battling the
outmoded beliefs of many educators who have never
yet acknowledged that women go to college for more
than a “MRS degree.”

It is discouraging that an academic institution such
as Columbia College has taken so long to change its
mind, but it's even more discouraging that supposedly
open-minded educators can still be so close-minded
when it comes to the advancement of women and the
development of America's future brain, power.

Dear Editor:
This is in response to an article in

‘last week’s Pitt News, “An Empty-

Seat 4 at Pitt Stadium,” by Diane
Lefkowitz.

It should be pointed out that stu-
dents of many major colleges must
pay a price per ticket almost as high
as a season ticket at Pitt. The state-
ment “We don‘t watch celebrities

. anymore, Dan Marine is gone,"

causes surprise that Ms. Lefkowitz
was even able to name the fine quar-
terback that we had the pleasure to
watch for four years, let alone any of
the other athletes that have given

Pitt some of the best football in the

country. There is no reason why this
trend,w‘on’t.,_continue.

Something also seems wrong with
Ms. Lefkowitz's economics. Specifi-
cally, when were concert tickets last
anywhere near nine dollars? This
amount might cover the cost of a
study guide, but not half a textbook
anymore. Four and one-half dinners
at Corky’s? Eating what-empty
hoagie buns? Fourumixed‘ drinks at a
bar—maybe. \ »

Unfortunately, inflation" is a fact
of life. It is true that it is often used as
an excuse and consumers get
abused. But efforts are also made by
some to hold costs down, and real
values do exist. Surely ﬁve Pitt foot-
ball games at $1.80 a crack is still
definitely one of these values.

Alternative Views I

D.C. March A Forum of Causes

(Editor’s note: The following was
printed in The Daily Collegian on
Aug., 30,1983).

Jobs, peace and freedom.

And nuclear disarmament, gay
rights, the environment, and Presi-
dent Reagan’s foreign and domestic
policy. And almost as if an after-
thought, the commemoration of the
I963 Civil Rights march galvanized
by Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I have
a dream” speech.

Causes, causes and more causes
were the order of the day on Satur-
day‘ when more than 200,000 people
gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in
Washington to march in peaceful
protest. if you had a cause, you had
an audience to listen and enough
press to cover it. .

If there was anything uniting
those who attended, it was the par-
ticipants“ anti-Reagan sentiment.
The march sent a warning to the
Reagan Administration that Ameri-
ca's liberals are not satisfied with the
way Reagan is running the country.

Columns

The Pitt News encourages
and accepts column submis-
sions from interested faculty,
students and staff. All sub-
missions should be typed and
double—spaced on non-
erasable paper. The subject
matter is left to the discretion
of the author. All submis-
si.o'ns should be addressed to
The Pitt News, Fourth Floor
Schenley Hall, arfd should

affiliation.

But this is nothing new. The liber-
als in American politics have been
anti-Reagan since he hopped on the
backs of the Moral Majority, to
further". his first presidential cam-
paign. The left ,wasn’t able to galvan-
ize its opposition then and despite
the strong outpouring of anti-
Reagan sentiment expressed at the
march, there is little real evidence
that they will be able to doit in 1984.

Sure, all the major speakers at the
march were anti-Reagan. They all
preached unity in their fight for
more jobs, human fights, and
nuclear disarmament. _

But there the unity stopped. Each
of thespeakers went off on their own
tangents, parading their causes and
giving their own reasons why Rea-

gan should no longer be president.‘

For that reason Reagan has a
good chance of winning in 1984. The
Democratic Party is already badly
divided. For the speakers represent-
ing minority groups opposed to
Reagan to trumpet their own causes
does little but demonstrate how
divided the party can be.

Panther Tickets Defended  

Ms. Lefkowitz’s attitude seems
related to the fact that unless
championship-caliber play can be
seen day in and day out, many Pitts-
burgh fans won‘t support our teams.
Perhaps Pitt won’t go ll and l or go
to a major bowl. Patience should
allow for some rebuilding. There
will undoubtedly be good football to
watch. .

I agree with Ms. Lefkowitz that it
would be crazy to pay $9.00 for the
same atmosphere that can be found
free at fraternity parties. No com-
ment on this is really needed. It is
just as well that she has given up her
seat, allowing room for someone
who will appreciate it.

Paul Watson

To be sure, a Democratic presi-
dent was elected the year after the
1963 march. But that march was
much more focused than its 1983
version. People were angrier then.

In the 1983 version, the marchers
in Washington were primarily pro-
ducts of the “me generation” of the
‘70s. Although it is no longer “in” to
be concerned only about one’s self,
some people have apparently
decided to go halfway and be con-
cerned only about those like
themselves.

Speakers at the march used this
opportunity to sell their causes in
much the same way as souvenir
vendors used the event to sell ‘every-

thing from commemorative T-shirts

to Martin Luther King paper fans.
fans.

The march should have been
organized to honor a great man and
his dream for America. The parade
of individual concerns was a dissser-
vice to the memory of a man who
preached unity. And it did little to
encourage the unity he preached.

Lecture

ERlK_ SCHWER

The University Honors Pro-
gram (U HP) will once again hold
its Noontime Lecture Series this
fall. . a
The idea for the series, which-
covers a wide variety of social,
intellectual, and technical topics,
was developed by members of
the Univerity Honors Progam
Student Cabinet four years ago.

The format of the lectures,
acccording to one cabinet
member, is “a cross between a
‘David Susskind and a David

- Letterman show, only with far

more ‘interesting guests.”

Current cabinet mern"bei%i
attribute much of the recent suc-
cess of the lecture series to the
early and continued guidance of
Alec Stewart, the director of the
honors program. Barry Appl-
baum, UHP advisor to the
cabinet, said some of the success
stems from the informality of the
program.

“It provides a forum for the
dynamic interaction of
extremely varied talents and
interests to take place informally

~ - outside of the classroom,” Appl-

baum said. “That’s the whole
idea of the series — in fact, most
people actually bring their
lunches to the hour or so long
lectures.” ,

Unlike guests on Susskind or
Letterman shows, those who
speak in the series give of their
time freely, even though all are
busy at the forefront of their
fields. Although most of the lec-
turers speak on topics in which
they are professionally involved,
some of the guests discuss wha-
tever is on their minds or in the
spotlight at the time — a charac-
teristic of the series that is said to
be among the most intriguing of
the events. I I

“The lectures involve topics
which are usually not discussed
in the classroom,” Applbaum
said. “This gives them the extra
twist that makes them especially
fascinating.”

In past years, the lecture series
was publicized via posters that
went up as the planning went
along. Planning this year will be
different. Because of the sche-
dule organized primarily by
cabinet officers Brad Delapena
and Phil Lauro in conjunction
with the Pitt Forum for Social
Responsibility and Values, the
lecture series will reach a much

wider and diverse audience. With -

the help of student activity fees,
schedules are being sent to all
university faculty and deans as
well as to administrators of all

" Free Computer Courses Available

:5.

I)

By TODD ERKEL

Since 1976, anyone with an inter-
est in learning more about comput-
ing at Pitt has been able to —— for
free. I

That year, the university compu-
ter center’s academic user services
group began offering a series offree,
non-credit courses open to anyone
wanting to take them —— students,
faculty and university staff.

As the use of computers at Pitt by
those groups increases, the availabil-
ity and number of these courses has
grown considerably.

The demand for the courses con-
tinues to rise as more departments
and their staff are introduced to the
computer as a daily, working tool
according to Jinx Walton of the
University Computer Center.

“They [faculty and staff] might be
learning to use a text processor, [so]
they will sign up for the SCRIBE
course,” Walton said. Walton said
that many of the people registering
for these courses are entering new
fields of computer usage.

The courses are funded as part of
the computer center services,
according to Walton. Instructors
provide their services voluntarily,
and while mos_t are computer center

personnel, teachers from other uni-
versity departments also conduct
some of the courses.

Walton expects the 14 courses
being offered this term to fill up
quickly, despite the addition ofmul-
tiple sections for some of the more
popular classes.

“The classes are usually packed,

99

A Walton said, “and as there is more

demand, newer courses and more
[sections] are added.”

Those who takethe courses can be
divided into two groups \-— the
beginners with little or no previous
computing experience and the
advanced user (those familiar with
Pitt’s existing software packages),
according to Gerry Santoro of the
computer center. Santoro regularly
teaches a course in computer gra-
phics in the non-credit program.

Those courses aimed at the
beginners require no previous
knowledge of Pitt’s computer sys-
tem but other classes have specific
prerequisites.

“We have had some problems
with people who thought they had
enough of a background for a
course,” Santoro said Another
problem Santoro has 5 :n, is the
overzealous student.

“People would sign up )r a bunch

ofcourses and then get bummed out
after the second or third one,” San-
toro said. The disgusted student
would then drop out of a course
leaving an empty seat which Santoro
knew other students would have
gladly filled.

Santoro asks that anyone inter-
ested in taking one of the free
courses carefully check the prerequi-
sites involved.

Anyone interested in learning
more about the non-credit programs
can pick up a brochure at any of the
university’s RJE stations.

Some of the courses offered
include:

Computing For The New User:
designed for those who have little or
no experience with computing. Five
sections of this course will be
offered.

Introduction To SCRIBE: a
course which outlines Pitt’s text for-
matting system. Experience with a
text editor like Updateis required.

Introduction To Graphics At Pitt:
a survey of the computerized gra-
phics facilities at Pitt.

Introduction To Microcompu-
ters: an overview of microcomput-
ing designed for the new user. Topics
to be covered include machine selec-
tion, future trends, office applica-
tions and market outlook.

Volunteers
Needed

Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape (PAAR) will be holding its
fall volunteer training during the
month of October.

PAAR needs volunteers to

‘CA\l[‘C IH lf IH IISI

By LINDA HENRY

Does a 1960's social commentary-

-novel-turned dramatization have

relevance today? A play set in World
War II might seem a bit nostalgic, like
a period piece concerned with issues
connecting the war it is depicting and
the time in which it was written. But,
if you haven't begun to fear the pros-
pect of nuclear holocaust, last week's
incident over Russian air-space
should stimulate your thinking. The
current production at the Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theatre features a young

*}army captain, Yossarian, who says

mid-way through the play, ”I’d rather
die than be killed.” Catch-22.

Now a part of _American lingo,
”Catch-22" became a popular phrase
in the '60s after Joseph Heller's novel
hit the best-sellers list. Yossarian
wants to stop flying combat missions
(people get killed flying combat mis-
sions). I-Iyfe need not fly anymore if he
is insane — all he has to do is ask. But,
if he asks to get out of flying missions
then he must be sane and therefore
capable of flying them, because only

an insane person would want to fly ,
"Catch-22"...and g

combat missions.
the beat goes on.
And what a tempo! This fast-paced
dramatization with 33 characters
(played by nine actors) struggling

‘through the absurdities of bureau-

cratic bullshit and trying to find

enmeshed by war is run like a fine-

trouble making distinctions —— other
than by use of props — between their

characters; though, in a sense, this
becomes an illustration of the imper-
sonal nature of war.

HOLD BACK THE NIGHT
By Abra Taylor
Pocket Books

Hold Back The Night, but don't hold
back the pages! You'll want to get
through this book as quickly as
possible-—otherwise you'll never
survive it. Joining the multitudes of
millions, Hold Back The Night ranks
with the best when it comes to mind-
less reading.

The story begins with the main
character, Domini Grey, spotting a
wooden sculpture of a unicorn in an
art gallery in New York's Soho dis-
trict. The sculpture was a copy of an
original made by Domini’s famous
and estranged father.

Domini’s desire to have the uni-
corn as a Christmas present for her
illegitimate daughter brings about
the unexpected reunion with the
actual sculptor and long-lost lover,
Sander Williams. Unbeknowst to
Sander, he was also the father of
Domini’s daughter, Tasey. Domini
had not seen or heard from Sander
since their tempestuous love affair in
Paris three years prior. She had no
way of knowing that she had inad-
vertently caused Sander’s blindness
as a result of a lovers’ quarrel.

Feeling responsible for Sander’s'

handicap, Domini strives to rekindle
the spark of artistic genius that he
had once possessed. By volunteering
herself as a model, and by goading
Sander into acknowledging his tal-
ent, Domini succeeds in her quest.

Unlike the majority of typical
romance novels, Hold Back The Night
does have one big difference: the plot
does not revolve exclusively around
lurid sex scenes. The sculptor does
sculpt, and the model does model. Nat-
urally there is a fair amount of bed-
room interludes, but for once, sex
does not dominate this charming
story.

Aside from the fact that the text is
basically unbelievable, this book has
accomplished the unusual—a cute
story with just enough spice to keep
your attention.

LOVE LIVES
By Carol Botwin
Bantam

Girls, are you a "Princess," a "Cos-
metic Iunkie,” a "Technicolor Lady”
or just a ”Mess?” Well, if you don't
think that you fit into any of those
categories, Carol Botwin has 46
other ”types of women” that she
carefully stereotyped in her book,
Love Lives: Why Women Behave The Way
They Do In Relationships. Sound like a
National Lampoon parody? Well, it isn't.

Actually, this book seems to be a
guide for men in recognizing the
behavior patterns of their female
companions, pick-ups or call girls.
Botwin goes into serious detail
explaining both what to look for
with each "type" and why that

woman is the way she is. She's even.

interviewed hundreds of men and
women to include their impressions
and anecdotes about each of the cate-
gories she’s included. Moreover, Bot-
win provides a list of 16 common
mistakes that women make in rela-
tionships which seems to be an
attempt to make this book marketa-
ble for women.

FORETOLD
By Gabriel Garcia Marquez
Knopf

Chronicle Of A Death Forelold has
caused no stir. In this instance, it is
not the fault of the Nobel Committee
and its kiss of death that Gabriel
Garcia Marquez’s newest novel is
mediocre; the book was published in
Spanish in 1982, well before Garcia

 

 

 

 
CHRONICLE OF A DEATH

maintain status quo.

Boys! is aimed at the early-teen
female. Its main and unusual distinc-
tion is that is written in the second-
person ”you;” the writing itself is
very basic and casual. Author Ian
Gelman is only 19 years old, which is
not as surprising as it seems. She's
managed to capture the dreamy gid-
diness of going steady in the sum-
mertime and learning just a bit about
passion.

Unfortunately — or perhaps typi-
cally, considering today's romance
fiction genre — Boys! reinforces ster-
eotypes: "you” are pretty and trim
because of that recent diet; -all the
boys want to date ‘'you.’’ Jill is ”your”
best friend, and ”you” have under-
standing parents and a bratty little
sister named Iulie. The popular boys

wavy or curly hair. The losers are
short, boring, clumsy, creeepy, acne-
coated twerps. ("Ugh. The mention
of Tommy Kaufman almost makes
you vomit.”)

”Follow Your Heart” is perhaps the
ultimate series for the '80s, with
books for the impatient reader who
cannot follow a book through a given
beginning, and middle and end
because she may not like the author’ s
plot. But is Boys! a daring innovation
in fiction writing or merely a gim-
mick cateringfto the lazy reader?

RICHARD SATER

On the one hand, Love Lives is quite
engrossing largely because it
attempts to classify female human
nature into so neat little explana-
tions. This, along with Botwin’s
apparent research, gives Love Lives
that old abnormal-psychology-
textbook flavor that draws the
reader into the book at least- long
enough to find the "type” that his
girlfriend fits or herself resembles.

On the other hand, this book is not
recommendable‘ for the same rea-
sons. Stereotypes, no matter how
well researched, are just a little too
tidy to be valid. In fact, anyone read-
ing the entire book will come to real-
ize that women they know exhibit at
least one quality from each one of the
50 types and that few, if any, of these
traits are exclusively female. The
bottom line is that human nature
cannot be generalized.

So, for the curious, Love Lives is an
interesting attempt to sort out the
complexities of the female persona.
However, the premise of this book is
much too cut-and-dry to be accepted
as entirely accurate.

around. Or perhaps they can — since
1969 and One Hundred Years of Solitude,
Garcia Marquez’s next two novels
have disappointed in their own ways.
Yet the disappointment of Chronicle
Of/1 Death Forelold is more worrisome.
Chronicle Of/1 Death Foretold takes no
risks. Garcia Marquez has been prac-
ticing his old trade of journalism in
the past seven years; his new novel is
told in solid, clean, this-then-that
prose that .is impressive in its clarity

V and evenness, but lacks the oral,

hyperbolic tone that characterizes
One Hundred Years of Solitude and the
stories in Innocent Erendira.

A man, also called Gabriel Garcia-
Marquez, or who, at least, has a wife
named Mercedes Barcha, the name of
G-M's wife, returns to his home vil-
lage in Colombia. after a long
absence. He has decided to make a
journalistic investigation of a brutal
murder which occurred there years
before. The murder is remarkable
because the dead man, Santiago
Nasar the Arab, was a friend of the
narrator's and also because it seems
that everyone in town, narrator
included, knew that the killing was
going to take place. No one warned
Santiago Nasar.

The murderers, a pair of indistin-
guishable brothers, commit the
crime to’avenge' the honor of their
negligent sister Angela Vicario, who
may or may not have been illicitly
deflowered by the dead Arab. The
sister, the most interesting character
in the novel, corresponding hope-
lessly with her vague husband of one
night. By combining his own recol-
lections with the testimony of wit-

nesses at the time of the trial, and

with their slightly, significantly dif-

ferent testimonies. years later, the

narrator learns about the lust, vanity
and kindness of Nasar. We read again
and again the conflicting words of
the villagers on the events of the
fatal day. This is a strange sort of
mystery, a crime novel in reverse —
instead of proceeding from a multi-
plicity of suspects and alibis to the
single possible solution, we know
the solution almost from the first
page andthen enter a labyrinth of
excuses, lies and gaps of memory.
The layering of alternate, sometimes

opposite accounts, the gradual reve- ‘

lation that the people of the village
have been lying for many years, the
infamous possibility that a clear
account, a "chronicle” of exactly
what happened, can never be made,
have interesting implications, but
Marquez’s handling of these effects
is careless and incomplete. The story
is not convoluted enough; the inside-
out mystery is too simple. The. reader
never grows’ uncomfortable in his
state of not-knowing, which is a
fault. Marquez has not tried hard
enough.

A second reading of A Chronicle Of
A Death Foretold is possible: this fore-
seen murder could ‘only have
occurred in a town like this. Of that,
Garcia Marquez succeeds in con-
vincing us. As a representation of

lmarriage, families and death in a

backward South American town
ruled by machismo, Catholicism and
”codes of honor,” the novel is con-
vincing journalism. In the two best-
written parts of the V novel —
different perspectives of the murder
of Santiago Nasar — Marquez’s
unflinching reporter's eye serves
him well: the passages are gruesome
and fascinating. In the end, however,
convincing journalism makes an
unconvincing novel of half-drawn

.characters in an incomplete maze.

 Graham Parker's ‘Real Macaw’:

  5% out or The Bird Cage 

THE REAL MACAW
Graham Parker
-Arista

Middle age.finds a wisened
Graham Parker who's still as
lean and passionate as he was
during his days with the Rum-
our. There's no spare tire
around this man's music — just
a whole lot of conviction. .On
The Real Macaw, Graham Parker
sees all, knows all, but he
reveals" just enough to ready his
listener for hopeless addiction.

One by one, Macaw illumi-
nates the many facets of
Parker's mid-life psyche. His
scorn is unleashed on ’’just Like
A Man,” a writhing apology to

.women for the poison of the
male double standard, ”Passive
Resistance,” a condemnation of
the stagnant music industry in
the same vein as ”Merc/ury Poi-
soning,” and ”Sounds Like
Chains,” which clutches for the
throat of oppression. Parker's
vulnerability squirms through
on ”Glass Jaw” and ”Beyond A
Joke," while an optimistic
"romanticism is evident on ”You
Can't, Take Love For Granted,”
”A Miracle A Minute” and
”Anniversary.”

Whatever the mood, Parker
finds the target. He remembers
the sins of his past, but he isn't

_ afraid to sin for ‘the future.
Always, though, the music
reflects the man.

THE WAITING
Fun Boy 3
Chrysalis

Probably this oneshould have

been called The Droning, except

that it.’ s really not that bad, and
besides, now that the FB3 has

' broken up, it really doesn't mat-

ter any more. Still, the album
persists. / C

One good move was pulling in
David Byrne as producer. It
seems that everything he
touches nowadays reeks of that
Burundi funk backbeat, and The
Waiting is no exception. How-
ever, Fun Boy 3 always did seem
to thrive in that African poly-
rhythm context, even when
they were part of the Specials.
It's Byrne’s production that
gives ”Our Lips Are Sealed”
such a primal feel and makes it
so much better than the Go-
Go’s version. The other real
gem of the album is ”Tunnel Of
Love,” which features some
wonderful whining by Terry
Hall, not to mention some nice
violin wor-k.

After those two songs,
though, the album seems to
pitch and roll into a lackluster
monotone that makes listening,
to the rest of it comparable to
the record's title.

Fun Boy 3 could’ve gone out
with a better release — they had
the capabilities to do it. Maybe
they figured that with The Wait-
ing they would make their de-
mise as tearless as possible by
having everyone sleep through
it. E

Showcase, Friday, September 9, I983

 

This article is for all of those peo-
ple, 19 and over, whoremember their
adolescent years but who have not
seen Risky Business. Hopefully, this
article, along with every other raving
review of this wonderful movie, will
convince those whofare lazy and thick
of skull to see this flick. If not, don't
come crying later on.

Risky Business is probably the ulti-
mate movie on teen rites of passage.
It is exceptional because it is so accu-
rate a recreation of those wonderful!
horrible years between the ages of 16
and 18. Director Paul Brickman (who
also wrote the script) obviously
remembers his adolescence, and he

V fills Risky Business with the humor, the

naioete, the daring and the bullshit
that is so much a part of growing up.

Joel, perfectly played by the
average looking (his acting is far from
mediocre though) Tom Cruise, is the
typical upper middle class neighbor-
hood. and family. As the opening
dream sequence of the movie reveals,
]oel’s main concerns seem to be losing
his virginity and gaining admission to
a ”respectable” university. Joel really
has no idea of what he wants in a
woman or in a career, but these wor-
ries must take a back seat, especially
when ]oel’s parents leave for vaca-
tion, entrusting him with the house
and, good Lord, the Porsche.

 

Rebecca De Mornay and Tom Cruise
star in the sexy comedy,Risky Business.

Brickman could have stopped there
and turned this movie into another
Porky-'s, but he doesn't. Instead, he

gives his movie depth and complexity“

by introducing an enterprising young

hooker, played skillfully by Rebecca L

De Mornay, who makes a house call

to Joel's place and ends up opening-

shop there. The following action and
dialogue is hilariously unique for
cinema, but_ often painfully accurate
for real life. . ’
Brickman takes his craft even
/further by avoiding every formula
scene that has been used in the last
zillion movies about ”growing up.”
Instead, he strives for the new angles:
his love scenes between Cruise and
DeMornay (are highly erotic situa-
tions rather than blatant bump-and-
grind shots, and his crafty use of

flashbacks, dreams and artistic
license give Risky Business a hazy effect
that is reminiscent of one’s adoles-
cent years. One brilliant scene shows
Cruise anxiously watching the clock,
awaiting the end of his last class for
the day. The clock takes excruciat-
ingly long to change times and when
it does, the hands move backwards
causing him to curse in the midst of
his peers and teacher. It is scenes like
these that make the viewer want to
grow up all over again.

Yes, practically every other review
of Risky Business has called it ”warm,"
”brilliant,” ”hilarious” and”sexy,” and
no doubt these descriptions are all
accurate. However, Risky Business is a
great movie for one more reason, and
that's because it remembers what
growing up is really all about. It
doesn't attempt to solve the traumas
of adolescence, but it sure makes
them easy to laugh about.

’Easy il\/lonely’

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

’ Rodney Dangerfield has found
respect during the past few years, at
least with the college crowd.

Although he's been in show business _

for several years, it wasn't until Cad-
dyshack became a hit with the younger
crowd that his career really took off._

 ihe Business Cf Growing Up

' By FRANK DIGIACOMO

Even that notorious snob rag Rolling
Stone gave up one of its ”in” starlet
covers to feature his ugly mug. His
brand of humor has been called
obnoxious, obvious, sick,’ crude and
stupid, but so what? He's laughing all
the way to the bank. To hell with
what the critics say (and Lord knows,
they say a lot) — he knows what his
audience thinks is funny, and he'll
keep selling out concert halls until
they stop buying tickets.

Which brings us to Easy Money,
Dangerfield's first leading role vehi-
cle which, for the most part, is receiv-
ing terrible reviews. Of course it's
obnoxious, obvious, sick, etc., etc.,
but what would you expect from a

s man who says: ”I got into a cab and

asked the driver where I could find a
good time. He pulled out his wallet‘
and showed me a picture of my wife!”

y Maybe ‘ the jokes are old, but the
' man's delivery — not to mention his

pop-eyed face that only a mother
could love — makes you laugh.

The same goes for Easy Money. The
jokes might not seem unique or
innovative, and the premise is hardly
brilliant (a sloppy, -vice-ridden baby
photographer gets the chance to
inherit $10 million from his mother-
in-law, but only if he gives up all of
his bad habits), _but somehow it's
funny as hell.

Put it this way: if you like Danger-
field,_you’re gonna like this movie.

Panthers Groom Another Quarterback  

By SCOTT DELLETT

Originally, the home opener
between Pitt and Temple was merely
a tune-up for the rest ofthe season, a
chance for a young team to gain con-
fidence over a weaker team.

There have been close games —
the 10-9 Pitt win in 1979 — but in
general, the Panthers have tamed

the Owls, averaging over 37 points-

per game for 10 years. In the last
three years, the margin has been 109-
19, not exactly enough to make the
Panthers fear the Owls.

This year, however, the Panthers’
annual beating up of the state-

may not materialize. Tennessee’s
Alvin Toles helped that by crushing
quarterback John Cummings’ left
collarbone. Tomorrow’s 1:30 p.m.
game at Pitt Stadium should be
titled Search For The Missing
Quarterback.

The. candidates are sophomores
John Congemi and Chris Jelic.
Neither has come to the forefront, as
evidenced by the fact that head
coach Foge Fazio had not named a
starter going into yesterday’s prac-

tice. Neither Congemi nor Jelic has‘

taken a snap in his short career, and

. both had setbacks during fall camp.
Jelic was contesting the starting
position before the thumb on his
throwing hand met_up with a helmet.
Congemi was sidelined with mono-
nucleosis just before camp, which
made him a non-contestant in the

. first of the Quarterback Wars. .

No matter‘ who starts, both will
see action. Jelic has been noted for

Pitt Above Cometltlone 

' By CHARLIE O‘HARA

This weekend, the Lady Panther
volleyball team (4-0) will play host
to Duquesne, Robert Morris,
Slippery Rock, Toledo and Kent
State in the Pitt Round Robin
Tournament. _

With their impressive start last
weekend, the Lady Panthers appear
to be head and shoulders above this
competition. They are looking to the
tourney as an opportunity to begin
building consistency -— the only
aspect missing from their opening

' victories of a week ago.

“Maintaining. intensity through-
out is very important,” Lady
Panther coach Shelton Collier said.
“A sustained effort’ is what it will
take later in the year, and we are
hoping that we have the discipline to
rehearse that effor.t this weekend.”

To make a sustained effort will be
asking a few things of the Lady
Panthers.

“We hope to continue to develop
our excellent serving,” Collier said.
“We will play a lot of games’ this
weekend and really have an oppor-
tunity to work on our serving in a
game "situation. “ '

“In addition, we have several new
offensive plays that we need to work
on in a game environment. We
should have the opportunity to work
with our setters and spikers and
some of these new playsets in hopes
of having them ready for next week-
end when we face Penn State and
Florida State." - ’

As for the Lady Panther lineup,
the weekend will provide those com-
petitors who haven’t already locked
down positions the opportunity to
do so.

“Competition for starting posi-
tions is fierce," Collier said. ‘‘I don’t
like to emphasize this too much
because I like the’ team unified
against our opponents —, not

by inconsistency. Congemi has more
control, which makes him the lead-

Temple head coach Bruce Arians

is a Congemi man, but that is under-
standable. He was, as an assistant at
Alabama, after the Florida native.
I “He’s a winner, a really tough
kid,” Arians said. “He’s got a great
throwing arm, and he’s from a high
school program that turns out great
players. ‘ i

“We tried to get him at Alabama. I
think he’s a heck.of a quarterback.”

Arians is thankful that he does not
have Fazio’s problems. He already
has a good quarterback in Tim Rior-

In Temple’s 17-7 win over Syra-
cuse, Riordan was 13 of 25 for 169
yards and one touchdown.

“I think Tim is one of the finest
quarterbacks in the country,"
Arians said. “He’s a great decision
maker, and he gives our inexpe-
rienced offense a lot of maturity.”

“He drops _back and he rolls out,”
Pitt quarterback coach Ron Turner
said. “He’s got excellent mobility,
and 1 think the biggest thing about
him is that he’s very confident. The
whole offense revolves around him."

The Owls’ leading rusher in 1982
also returns. Harold Harmon gained
883 yards last season, including a
209-yard performance against Dela-
ware. Jim Brown starts at tailback.

Riordan will direct his tosses to
wide receivers Russell Carter and
Ellis Primus, who caught a 38-yard
scoring strike, against Syracuse. The
offensive line is led by center Mike
Berger and guard Tore Barbaccia.

The defense is led by two corner-'

backs, Anthony Young and Kevin
Ross. Both combined for ll inter-
ceptions last season. Linebackers
Tom Kilkenny and Bob Balkunas

are forces in the Owls’ 4-4 defense.
Both were 1-2 in total tackles in
1982. Tackle Chuck Cohen was
impressive against Syracuse, sack-
ing Orange quarterbacks twice while
also making six tackles.

The kicking game is handled by _ “

Kip Schenefelt, who is also a backup
quarterback, along with Jim‘Cooper
and Mike Abbott.

By 4230 p.m. tomorrow, Pitt may
be glad Temple was the opponent.
They may also be pleasantly sur-
prised. Fazio hopes so.

PITT NOTES:
mings, who is out for at least four

weeks, guard Mike Dahl, running ‘

back Chuck Scales and tight end Pat
Schipani I are questionable. For
Temple, tight end Jim Ermert is
doubtful and guard Eric Cos is prob-

 At the middle blocking positions,

'l982 All-Big East selection Ulana

Kohutiak seems a certain starter,_
but -it appears that freshman Sue"

Hoover could grab the other spot,
forcing last year's starter Carmen
Tapia — a member of the Puerto
Rican national team -— to" contri-
bute elsewhere.

“Sue came to school in great
shape and really ready to play,”Col-
lier said. “She is going to be a very
good collegiate player.” .

At this point, “she will play either
middle blocker or our right side

-gposition, depending on the situation

and our players.”

As for the outside hitting posi-
tions, much has yet to be decided.
‘ Freshman Kris Wexell, called the

. most consistent player on the team

by Collier, has one position secured,
but the other has more than its share
of competition. Hoover, Sally Gil-
lespie, Pat Belcher and Regina
Reyes are all strong candidates-

Competition within a team often

that same competition can build
strength and togetherness. '

SOME OF THE
  MOST
IMPORTANT
WORK FOR
CANCER IS
BEING DONE
OUTSIDE
THE LAB.

It's being done by
people like Madeline
Mitza and Theresa
Barbieri.

They met when
Madeline was in treat-
ment for breast cancer
and Theresa was the
volunteer who drove
her to her therapy ap-
pointments. Now, like
Theresa, Madeline is
brin ing help and hope -
to at ers as a Reach to
Recovery volunteer. _

The work in the lab
must continue.'So must
the work outside. We
need your help.
