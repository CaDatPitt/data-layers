Fallen from   the Heights of Excellence 1

 

Will Our University Continue to Decline?

  

We have been watching in amazement
these past few months the changing face of
our University. It did not all begin during
the summer of last year when we became
a state-related institution, but the inability
of our State Legislature to pass our appro-
priations has denied us that security we
had hoped to ﬁnd in our new relationship
with the state.

We knew we might have to retrace some
of the steps on the road to excellence we
followed during the Litchﬁeld era. We were
launched into a new, quieter era under the
expert hand of Chancellor Emeritus David
H. Kurtzman, a man well versed in ﬁnance
and able to put the University back on its
feet again after it had incurred the stag-
gering $19.5 million debt.

We had thought the University was
back on its feet again; we were Wrong. The
one advantage of being a state-related in-
stitution————ﬁnancial security———has continued
to elude us. We are now facing a possible
tuition hike to be in effect September, _1968.
No one will say that for certain, but no one
of any authority can say that our tuition
will not be doubled. If there is no money in
the State treasury to provide for our tui-
ti-on subsidy, there will be no recourse but

The

to raise tuition. Chancellor Posvar has ad-
mitted that a cut in the University’s appro-
priation will make a tuition hike only the
ﬁrst in a series of budget set backs. We are
not saying that there will be a raise in tui-
tion, but the possibility "cannot be ignored.

We became state-related to give our in-
stitution ﬁnancial security. It is lamentable
that we must continue to tremble as we did
that summer of 1965 when everyone won-
dered whether we could survive our ﬁnancial

crisis. We question if one can call the pre- L

sent state of affairs a real survival. Our
ﬁnancial insecurity precludes any kind of
progress our University can make in other
areas. How can We become a quality institu-
tion if we can barely pay our operating ex-
penses, and we’re forced to borrow several
million dollars to do that?

The crisis facing our University is a
real one. It hits us in our pocketbooks, but
it also affects us in innumerable intangibles
that together compromise a “quality” in-
stitution. We are not satisﬁed with the cur-
rent state of affairs; we urge all those who
agree with us to register their protest by
ﬁlling out the accompanying form and plac-
ing it in one of the designated boxes. We
must show we care; otherwise we deserve
our fate. t

 

To: Governor Raymond P. Shafer
Recognizing that ﬁnancial security is essential to
the maintenance and growth of excellence in education
at the University of Pittsburgh, I hereby register my
dismay with state legislators and officials in‘ failing to
approve promised funds. I would hope the deadlock over

appropriations will soon be resolved.

University Dilemma: State

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

by Dan Lichtenstein and Paul Stoller

The legacy of excellence for the University is dying. Its de-
cline began with the disappearance of ﬁnancial support from
community lead-ers. At one time, the students and administration
of this University entertained the hopes that this institution

State’s University Heads
Send Telegram to Shafer

(The following is the text of a telegram sent Friday by
Dr. Wesley Posvar and four other university presidents to Ray-
mond Shafer, Governor of Pennsylvania, and all legislators. Miss
Helen Knox, director of news and publications at the University,
reiterated that ‘the University is committed not to raise tuition
rates this year.)

Failure to appropriate scheduled funds for our ﬁve uni-
versities will have a disastrous effect on higher education in
Pennsylvania. Students, faculty, and all citizens will ask if
the Governor and legislature really believe in education as a
tool for progress. This failure will cause us to lose faculty,
postpone educational programs, possibly close ﬂacilities, and
will force us to adopt massive tuition increases which stu-
dents and their parents may not be in a position to pay. We
plead for immediate action to provide the funds We We're led
to expect would be appropriated.

would «achieve the academic ex-
cellence of the Ivy League uni-
versities. '1‘-hese hopes existed
only threeyears ago. Today the
hopes are lost in the struggle to
obtain funds needed «to main-
tain the image the University
has had for the last ten years.

In-his 1957 inaugural address
ex-Chancellor Litchﬁeld set a
series of goals for the Univer-
sity. “As this particular admin-
istration takes office, it does so
with a pledge vigorously to pur-
sue the new objectives outlined
by trustees and faculty . . . "
Litchﬁeld had high academic
standards in mind. The only ob-
jective today seems to be to ob-
tain the state funds necessary
to avoid a raise in tuition.

Litchﬁeld sought, “. . . to pre-
serve all that is ﬁne in this in-
stitut.ion’s tradition, a.nd to main-
tain faithfully the highest stan-
dards of universal scholarship.”
Universal scholarship has been
relegated to a secondary goal
to be sought only after a group
of politicians in Harrisburg have
paciﬁed themselves.

The address also stressed the
University's role in society. In
order for the University to ful-
ﬁll this role -in society, it is ne-
cessary to take “. . . office with
a plea for a concept -of institu-
tional fu-nctiions as broad as so-
ciety’s needs, for an interpreta-
tion of clientele as comprehen-
sive as the groups in the com-
munity which could beneﬁt from
the Un-ive-rsivty’s functions, and
for a willingness to undertake
the changes which are requisite
to the performance of these
functions.

 

“Thus conceived,” according to
the address,” this University,
and any other s-imillarly dedi-
cated, may assume a new and
greater role in a society whose
dimensions are new and ever-
changing, but whose values of
freedom remain constant.” How
can the University fulﬁll its role
to the state or society if the
state does not fulﬁll its role to
the University?

The address then discussed
the University's responsibilities
that go beyond academic excel-
lence. “But the University can-
not relax its efforts when it real-
izies the goal of academic ex-
cellence. There can be no res-
pite. Achievement can only mean
additionall responsibility. New
goals have already been estab-
lished and the Uni-versity is
working toward them. They en-
compass intellectulal, economic
and cultural improvement in
the community; more meaning-
ful cooperation with corporate

enterprise in the research area; .

new respon-sibilities in urban de-
velopment; an even more exten-
sive role in world affairs; and a
stepped-up effort in development
of knowledge availability sys-
tems so that man can efficient-
ly store and use the vast quan-
tities of new knowledge that are
being generated." The Universi-
-ty cannot meet these world -and
societal responsibilities today be-
cause it is so preoccupied with
its own financial problems.
These ﬁnancial problems in-
hibit every conceivable goal of
the University. “The attainment
of academic excellence, the re-
cruitment of the ﬂnest faculty

and the completi-on of its mas-
sive bwilding program will give
the University the basic human
and material resources it re-
quires to meet the challenge of

the -decades ahead as one of .

society's greatest sources ﬂoor
good.”

The current legislative stale-
mate concerning Unive-rs-iity ap-
-propriations makes the attain-
ment of these essential goals an
impossibility. Academic excel-
lence requires bot-h superior stu-
dents and a superior faculty.
The present financial uncertain-
ty discowrages the recruitment
of both parties. Although ammo-
pnitaions for the building pro-
gram have been passed, the
beautiful, new Hillman Library
is -next to useless Without an
aura of academic excellence sur-
rounding it.

,Will the state legislature al-
low the University to meet the
“challenge of the decades ahead,”
o-r will it condemn the _ Univer-
sity to be a puppet forever dan-
gling from the strings of state
politicians? «Given the unfortu-
nate ﬁnancial situation today,
the puppet status seems more
probable.

The address concluded: “The

University is art the halfway ‘

mark. Much has been accom-
plished. Much remains to be
done. The propspects for achieve-
ment are bright.” The Universi-
ty IlS still at the halfway mark.
What has been accomplilslhed is
now submerged in the ﬁnancial
dilemma. ,

The only thing that is bright
now is the ﬁre raging from the
battle in Harrisburg. --

Total Ban on Research
Will Restrict Freedom

On University Campus

by EDWARD GERJUOY
Pro_fessor of Physics .

To avoid any misunderstanding, I ﬁrst state that I have
had no classiﬁed contracts during my University career,
nor do I have any intention of accepting such contracts in
the future. Indeed, I am strongly opposed to the practice
of carrying on classiﬁed research in the University, for vari-
ous reasons which are summarized by the assertion that the
restrictions classiﬁed res-earch imposes on the free transmission
of -information adversely affect the University community. More-
over, like many other faculty members who wish to ban secret
research, I presently ﬁnd defense-related research specially re-
-pugnant because of our involvement in the Vietnam war, which
I have criticized as often and loudly as just aboutany other fac-
ulty member on campus.

Nevertheless I strongly oppose any unqualiﬁed ruling by this

Administration, or by the Faculty Senate, that the University of
Pittsburgh will not accept any classiﬁed research contracts. The
point is th-at in -this complicated and illogical World the principles
-by which we try to live often ar-e -at cross purposes. In the prese-nt
instance, the Worthy desire to ensure unrestricted communication
of vinforrnation conﬂicts with the University's cherished policy of
academic freedom. Academic freedom implies the -belief that a
faculty member who satisfactorily fulﬁlls his teaching obligations
has the right to engage in research he chooses. For a tenured fac-
ulty member the University goes even further. In awarding tenure
the University agrees to back the professor’s own judgment as to
how he should spend his non-teaching time, though this may mean
he does no -research and/ or supports unpopular causes far removed
from his ﬁeld of specialty.
‘ Evidently it is this principle of academic freedom which has
made it possible for universities to spawn new ideas, to work on
problems which the community may consider frivolous or socially
undesirable, and to become centers of opposition against the Viet-
nam war. I am most unwilling to concur in any weakening of aca-
demic freedom. I am astonished that those faculty advocates of
an absolute ban on all University secret research contracts do not
realize they are prejudicing the argument that academic freedom
must be inviolate, an argument they weil may have to make in
the very near future should the government attempt to stiﬂe anti-
Vietnam dissent.

For lack of space, in -the foregoing, I have concentrated -on aca-
demic freedom, which is the essence of my case against an abso-
lute -ban, though not the only argument one can muster. On the
other hand I am Willing to accept regulations to prevent abuses,
provided these regulations do not contravene the fundamental re-
quirement that no faculty member should be hindered from per-
forming research he genuinely wishes to carry out, whether this
research is popular or u'npopu'la»r, classiﬁed or unclassiﬁed, trivial
or profound. For example, -to keep the Universityfrom setting up
an -organization like the Rand Corporation, I favor the regulations
that all -classiﬁed contracts must have .a full-time tenured faculty

[member as principal investigator, and that not less than ten per

cent of the time charged -to any classiﬁed contract must be per-
formed by full-time tenured faculty.

 

 

 

Dr. Allen Praises Plays for Significance

D-eVega Offers Meaningful Drama

by ARNIE YOUNG

“Lope de Vega stressed a
relationship that we have
forgotten; the parallel be-
tween today's and yester-
day’s events,” said Dr. Ralph
Allen, associate professor of
speech and director of the Uni-
versity Theatre. Allen was one
of «the speakers at the seminar
on “Drama and World Affairs.”

Dr. Allen praised de Veg«a’s
16th century plays for having
applicable meaning in today's
world. A

Other members of the panel
discussing de Vega’s work were
David C. Gild, business manager
of the University Theatre; Dr.
Angel Gonzales-Arauzo, Iacting
chairman of the University’s De-
partment of Hispanic Languages
and Literature; and Glorianne
Engel, technical director of the
University Theatre.

Dr. "Gonzales-Aruazo claimed
de Vega a “dramatic man whose
own life was the best drama he
ever wrote.” Dr. Gonzales-Arau-
zo said, “de Vega wrote for his
public and damn the critics. He

Thus within the classroom, said
Scala, the actual industrial en-

Further, Dr. Scala. uses the
case history method of teaching
wereby a problem will be pre-

would be done .on the industrial
level. “For example, it might be
asked how the efficiency of the
gas turbine could be increased?
Immediately the metallurgical
student thinks about changing
the composition of one of the
parts. A mechanical engineering
student might want to change
its structure in some way. En-
ergetic debates ensue,” stated
Dr. Scala, “just as is the case
when any large industry desires
to effect such a change.

“The student, then, by h-.av-
-ing to defend his position is
necessarily subjected to the
opinions of those with differing
backgrounds. He thus becomes

more aware of his place in the
industrial spectrum,” according

UFO Data

Scientiﬁc data on Uniden-
tiﬁed Flying Objects (UFO)
will be presented and dis-
cussed at the upcoming Stu-
dent-Facully Workshop - Dec.
11. William Weitzel, recog-
nized experton UFO’s, will
give factual data on the sub-
ject, present his own point
of View and interpretation and
then open the floor for ques-
tions and discussion.

Weitzel will speak in Drinin-g
Room A, SU, at 7:15 p.m. and
refreshments will be served. His
lecture is the first of a series of
workshops sponsored by the
Faculty-Student Seminar entitled
“New Trips in Space.” Later
workshops will be concerned
with ESP and LSD.

the masses not just to the nobil-
ity. What mattered to -de Vega
was the theatre should seem
life-like and real to the audi-
ence.”

Dr. Gonzales-Aruazio added to
Dr. Allen's point by stating that
“de Vega put in the kind of

‘ theme that meant something to

Spain and now it means some-
thing to us.”

Dr. Alfredo Roggiano, profes-
-sor of Hispanic languages and
literature at the University stat-
ed that “when theatre came to
the New World it preferred the
Greek allegory, to inﬂuence so-
ciety. Then the realistic theatre
showed the social conﬂicts.” This
was a different slant on the
question of drama and society.
De Vega was -inﬂuenced by so-
ciety and as theatre progressed
it inﬂuenced society, he empha-
sized.

Gloria Engel spoke of the set

design in a de Vega play. “It's

exciting to see the body in mo-
tion against a three dimensional
background. De Vega provided
the action and we created an
exciting unit set.”

Draft Resistors
Sponsor Service

A service of draft resistance
will be conducted tonight at the
Belleﬁeld Church at 8 p.m. Sev-
eral students who are attending
the University Will hand in their
draft cards and dissociate them-
-selves from the Selective Serv-
ice System, and ‘a number of
people, several from the Univer-
sity’s faculty, will indicate their
support for the draft resis:tor’s
actions.

The service, to which all mem-
bers of the University are wel-
come and urged to attend, will
consist of statements from the
resistors themselves, statements
of support, poetry readings, and
singing. The organizers of the
event have indicated that atten-
dance at the service does not
mean one is supporting the ac-
tion. A

Tonigh-t’s meeting is part of a
nation-wide program of draft re-
sistance; similar church meet-
ings are being conducted today
and tonight in several cities, and
other forms of resistance are
planned for today and the re-
mainder of the week.

Leaders of the Pittsburgh
draft resistance movement say
that t0night’s meeting is just
their first program. They con-
template different actions in the
future, and hope to reach new
people. They are anxious to
reach members of various
groups in the Pittsburgh area:
groups of parents, church wom-
en, fraternities, professional peo-
ple, etc.

I won't

go into business when
I graduate because:

[1 a. I'd lose my individuality.
D b. It's graduate school for me.
C] c. My mother wants me to be a doctor.

Can’t argue with c), but before you check
a) or b)—pencils up! There have been some
changes. Drastic changes in the business
scene. But changes in the vox populi attitude
regarding business. . . especially on campus
. . . just haven’t kept pace.

Take the belabored point that business
turns you into a jellyﬁsh. The men who run
most of the nation’s successful ﬁrms didn’t
arrive by nepotism, by trusting an Ouija
board, or by agreeing with their bosses. Along
the way. a well-modulated “No” was‘- said.
And backed up with the savvy and guts to-
days business demands.

In short, individuality is highly prized in
much of the business world—the successful
much. Even when the business is big. Like
Western Electric, the manufacturing and sup-
ply unit of the Bell System.

We provide communications equipment for

 

our Bell System teammates, the Bell telephone

companies. This takes a lot of thought, deci- .

sions, strong stands for our convictions, (and
sometimes some mistakes . . . we're human,
every 160,000 of us).

Individuality pays oil‘. Not only in raises,
but in personal reward as well. Like an engi-
neer who knew deep down that there was a
better way to make a certain wire connector
—and did. Or a WE gal who streamlined time-
consuming office procedures, and saved us
some $63,000 a year.

Rewards and accolades. For saying “No."
For thinking creatively and individually. For
doing.

Not every hour is Fun Hour, but if you’ve
got imagination and individuality-you've got
it made. With a business like Western Electric.
We'll even help you answer b) with our Tui-
tion Refund program. Come on in and go
for President!

The True Story

Even Mudvi1le’s

Casey Struck Out
By George Lies

Associate Sports Editor

If only for that one moment, Dave Hart was happy.
Navy held off Army to win 19-14, and Hart was happy for
his good friend and former boss, Bill Elias. .

It had been rumored Elias was on his way out, if Navy
did not win. Hart, a former assistant under Elias, may have
realized this too after Navy barely escaped defeat agalnst
the Panthers. _ _ .

“You’ve got to beat Army,” Hart sa1d, _putt1ng h1S arm
around N avy’s defensive halfback Roger Lammers afte-r the
Panther game. “That’s the game.”

“Win it for Bill,” he said.

Ironically, Elias may _someday- realize
the same thing about Hart.

For right now, Hart is like the gambler
whohas put all his stakes on one roll in a
dice game. If he loses, he’s out of the game.
Hart’s stakes are this year’s freshmen team,
and the dice game is Pitt’s idealized type of
football.

THOUGH DISGUSTED with two years
of losing teams, many people still are will-
ing to give Hart his chance. They have
heard much about this year’s frosh, and
next fall, they will expect Pitt to win.

But Hart is running into a dead end, just like Johnny
Michelosen before him. In the last two years, Hart has giv-
en--out over 65 scholarships. In the binding agreement with
Penn State, West Virginia, and Syracuse limits the num-
ber of scholarships to 100 over a four year period. This
means Hart can give-out only 35 grants the next two years.

What was supposed to be the home premier for coach
Bill Grant’s_ swimming team Saturday night, actually turn-
ed out-to be a. visit to Indiana State State Saturday afternoon. The
schedule miix-ulp had no effect on -the swimmers though. They cap-

son, defeating Indiana State,

 

It was the same setup which cost Michelosen his job.

And too, the four schools in 1962 signed angagreement
which outlaws redshirting. Thus, only if a player is injured
can he be held-out a year, and still have three years of

’ eligibility.

5 All of this came to mind while this writer listened to

Penn State laughter.

, Jack Henry’s halftime interview of Dean Billick during the

BILLICK, the Pitt sports information director, talked
about winning football. He talked about the “studs” Dave
Hart was recruiting. He talked about next year, and the

year after next.

His voice boomed out the

words ‘people have been hear-

ing all season. Freshmen. Hopes. Victories.

, But one can only imagine what will result, if the Pan-
thers don't win. All those hopes, and all those words of
praise w-on’t be worth a plug nickel.

Pitt will be like Mudville, and again there will be no
joy. The school will lose its quality, its classic style of ma-
jor college football, and its integrity.

Presenty, the Panthers ﬁt into place in this city full

of losers.

But it doesn't have to be that way. No sir, it doesn’t.

“Everybody gave his max-

. mum effort, as they put the ‘me’

in their swimmn.g,” said Grant.
According to Grant, the swim-
mers showed they can swim the

Matmen Finish Third

Shildt Only Quadrangular Champ

by ROY JACOBS
Several close matches cost
the varsity wrestlers a high-
er ﬁnish in their quadrangu-
liar meet -at Ohio State Saturday,
but coach Dave Adams seemed
fairly happy with his team's

perf-orrnance -afterwlalrds.

“Some of the boys were pleas-
ant surprises,” reviewed Adams,
“but some of the others were a
l»i't1t~le -disappointing.” The mat-
men ﬁnished. third with 56
points, behind Ohio State with
77 and Eastern Michigan with
57. Hrisram, the fourth .school,
scored 24.

“I think we’re as good as
Ohio State and Eastern Michi-
gan,” said the coach. “Ohio State
came out on top because they
made fewer rmxistiakes and they’re
a little ahead of us. By the end
of -the year, we'll be able to
_hold our own with either in a
duel meet.”

As it was, three grapplers lost
to Ohio State wrestlers- in the
second round. All were in the
match until the end, and Adams

" felt that any of his boys could
V have won on any given day.

 

Although all the varsity Wrest-
lers won at least one match, the
only overall champion was Dick
Shildt at 137 pounds. Shildt was
actually wrestling ttwo weight
classes above his usual class.

“‘S'hildt looked Very good at
137,” noted Ad-ams. “He wrest-
led two near perfect ro-unds al-
though he was much, much
smaller than «those he wrestled.”
Shildt won his two b01.llt'S, 5-1 and
5-2.

Four other varsity matmen
copped second place ﬁnishes:
Bruce Ungangst (123), Dave
oJhnson (145), Tim Trax (160),
and Randy Kahler (177). For
Unangst and Trax, the losses
were especially rough, both los-
ing decisions on riding time.

“Bruce did a good job,” re-
ﬂected the coach. “He wrestled
some good boys and took sec-
ond. He lost 5-4 on riding time,
but the bout could have gone
either way. It was nip and stuck
until the end.

“Trax was good for ‘a match
and a half,” Adams continued.

"“He just made one mistake in

the ﬁnals, when he gave his man

a takedown in the ﬁrst period.”
Johnson also lost his title match
-on a :takedown——in the ﬁnal per-
iod.

To Adams, the most interest-
ing statistic for the meet was.
the individual match ﬁgure. Of
the 18 matches the team wrest-
led, the varsity won ten.

“This was very encouraging
to us,” reported Adams. “Last
year the team lost a lot more
indiviiduuarl bouts than they won.”

Individual wins are just the
ﬁrst step towards team victories.

States number -one man, it was
due to inexperience, not condi-

Coach Grant Was, impressed
with Indiana State's maiden ef-
fort as a swimming team. “One
thing they -had that we d-idn’t
was numbers. They must have
had over 30 boys,” he said.

“They have a good energetic
young coach. By the end of the
season I feel they could have a
very decent and respectible
team.”

Lane took firsts in the 50, 100,
and 1,000-yard freestyle events.
“John was willing to swim
wherever I put him. He even
wanted to attempt some diving.”
Lane's performance typlified the
team's overall versitility.

Price led the ﬁeld in the 200-
yard individual medley and the
200-yard backistroke. He -also
swam a leg on the winning 400-
yard medley relay team.

Ream won in the 200 a.nd 500-
yard freestyle races, and swam
a leg on the 400-yard freestyle
relay team.

team’s victory.‘Howard captured

-Many people believed that the Scarlet Knights Would be Weak
this year, having lost their two top scorers in guards Bobby Lloyd

The Panthers actually started
well, playing Rutgers even for
-the ﬁrst nine minutes. “We were
loose at the start,” said Tim-
mons. “Then their press and
the crowd started getting to us.

The sophs got a little jittelrygél

and we tightened up.”

With the score standing at
18-18, Rutgers suddenly burst
out to a 39-22 lead, but Tim-
mons refused to blame this com-
pletely on the Panthers nervous-
ness -and numerous turnovers.

“We had a lot of turnovers,
but so did they,” he explained.

“It was just that they were mak- -

ing their shots and we weren't.
They had that crowd full of stu-
dents cheering them on, and
they shot very well on their
home co
of 67 ﬁeld goals, for better than
50 per cent.

“They’re not a great defen-
sive ball club,” Timmons con-
tinued, “and it wasn't a rnatter
of us not getting shots, it was
just a matter of not making
them. Rob McFarland made only
one for 11, and they were all
good shots.”

Trailing badly at the begin-
ning of the second half, Tim-
mons went to a press. “We came
back and started to pull up. I

think we got to within 14 points,,..,.

but time was running out and
we had to foul to get the ball,
and they kept making their
f-ouls.” The Scarlet Knights hit
on 26 of 32 from the free throw
line.

“I think it was the fouling
and the fact that I put in my
bench and was playing it against

their best club that made the‘

score look so bad,” Timmons
said.

Still, there were bright spots,

for the cagers, even in defeat.
Mike Paltcher scored 21 points
in his ﬁrst varsity game, -and at
the unfamiliar ‘position of cen-
ter. “Mike ha-d a real good open-

ing game,” Timmons noted. “We .

saw he was hi'tt'ing, so we fed
him.” Patcher did most of his
scoring on drives and short
jumpers from the key.
Another soph, Bob Petrini

also impressed Tirnmons. “Pet- ‘

rinli ‘showed that he’s going to
be a bal'lpl.ayer. And Len Ka]5ajt‘a_
played well.” Each hit for 13
