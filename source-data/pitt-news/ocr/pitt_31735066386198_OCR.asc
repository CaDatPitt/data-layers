Pitt students upset
over Carlow dorms

By Chrissy Cullen
For T be Pitt News

Pitt freshman Joely Brochetti
lives in a dormitory. But Brochetti
isn’t allowed to have male visitors
after 11 p.m. or before 4 p.m. And
the meal plan Brochetti was
required to purchase doesn’t do
her much good, since she can’t
use it for anything except dinner.

Brochetti is one of 40 Pitt
students living in the Carlow
dorms because of a lack of space
in Pitt’s student housing.

“I think 11 p.m. is ridiculous
[...l. I think the hours should be
extended a little before 4 p.m.
and a little after 11 p.m,” said
Brochetti.

The rules that the Pitt students
at Carlow abide by are similar to
Pitt’s except for the visiting hours.
The students must sign out male
friends by 11 p.m. during the
week and by 2 a.m. on weekends.
Female visitors and relatives may
stay as long as they like.

“I felt uneasy about walking
down Fifth Avenue after business
hours are over. A lot of times a
guy walks [me] home, and he
can’t even come in because it’s
after 11 p.m,” she said. Between
classes Brochetti isn’t able to study
in her dorm room with any of her
male friends before 4 p.m.

Freshman Angie Buren said that
Carlow’s mealiplan also causes

problems. Buren and the rest of
the Pitt students that live in Carlow
are not permitted to purchase Pitt
meal plans. They are required to
purchase Carlow meal plans,

which they find difficult to use.

Buren said that the only time
Pitt students living at Carlow can
use their meal plans is at dinner,
since during the day they are busy
attending classes and do not have
time to walk back to get their
meals.

“I usually grab a candy bar for
lunch because I don’t have time
to walk back to Carlow between
classes,” Buren said.

Sister Mary Paul, director of
Residents and Life at Carlow,
explained why the Pitt students
have to follow the Carlow dorm
rules. Paul said that the visiting
hours are justified.

“The students need their
privacy. The students wanted that.
This is not something new. Long
ago the students wanted those
rules; they asked for them,” Paul
said “This is an all-residence hall.
We do not make exceptions for
anyone.”

Carlow students would follow
Pitt’s rules if the situation were
reversed, Paul said.

“I don’t think_it’s right [for the
students to complain]. These
people came here of their own
will. They have to follow the

“I think we had a lot of interesting programs,” said Susan
Hansen, director of Pitt’s women’s studies department, who
facilitated a workshop on sexism and racism in rock and rap
music. “The group that did come [to the workshop] was great.
They had a lot of good questions and interaction.”

Although the approximately 15 participants met in a room
designed to seat 150 people, Hansen said that the quality of the
interaction among the few participants that did show up was
_more important than the quantity.

Director of student activities Joe Cavalla, who oversaw the
planning of the festival activities, echoed Hansen’s sentiment.

“I’m pleased about the participation of the variety of different
groups," he said. “I don’t measure success in terms of attendance.

Mail delays anger dorm residents

By Jennifer Kociela
For T be Pitt News

When students in Lothrop~Hall
returned to school this year, they
had a surprise waiting for them.

According to Camille Cade, the
eighth-floor resident assistant at
Lothrop Hall, the students were
told that they would have to pick
up their mail at Tower B, and they
would also have to wait in line at
the housing office to get their
mailbox combinations.

lines that lasted the whole day."

After Labor Day, students ﬁnally

This .

began receiving their mail at
Lothrop; yet, they still were not
getting it quickly. Cade said,
“Sometimes mail sits for three or
four days before it is put in the
mailboxes.”

Bob Robinson of the housing
office disagreed. He said, “The
mail is sorted daily on a regular
schedule by work-study
employees. You will always have
delays anywhere. We do the best
we can.”

Another complaint that the
students have, according to Cade,
is that there are no set hours during
which they can pick up packages.

Cade said, “Last year the hours
were posted. This year there
seems to be no regular hours.”

Cade also said that she has
received similar complaints from
the residents on her floor.

Robinson said, “The desk
attendant will get packages [for
students] all“ day if the students
present their slips.”

Robinson said that it hasn’t been
publicized that desk attendants
will get packages for students
and that he will make sure the
students are aware of this
procedure in the future.

Amnesty aids political prisoners

By Aric Buckholt
For T be Pitt News

Christinah Boikhutso of South
Africa has been held captive since
Aug. 25, 1990, following the
launch of an African National
Congress branch in Mabopane.

Yesterday, the Pitt branch of
Amnesty International sponsored
a letter-writing table in an effort to
secure the release of Boikhutso
and other political prisoners
around the world.

The letter-writing table in the
basement of the William Pitt Union
was available forbstudents and

faculty to write letters and sign
petitions. According to Jennifer
Coopie, president of the Pitt
branch, “We usually get around
200 people, and we hope to get at
least that many today.” The group
also had forms available to sign
up for membership.

Amnesty International is
encouraging people to send letters
to various members of the South
African government urging that
Boikhutso be freed. Amnesty is
concerned for her health and
physical safety, especially in view
of recent reports that another
state—of— emergency detainee,

Wendy Skhosana, was severely
assaulted in the custody of
Bophuthatswana police.

The group also had a letter for
people to sign concerning
Marakkala Manage Premaratne, a
businessman from Godauda,
Kottegoda, Southern Province. He
has not been seen since his arrest
in Sri Lanka two years ago.

The letter, addressed to Sri
Lankan President R. Premadosa,
asks that he take “immediate

A guide to dealing with police encounters

By Mark Smith
sum W1-lter

For whatever reason, many
people worry about being
arrested. However, criminals are
not the only individuals
concerned with criminal
procedure. Every day, people
interact with police ofﬁcers. Many
law-abiding citizens fear the
police simply because of the
thought of arrest. If you are
nervous when in contact with the
police, then know your rights;
your fear will subside.

The following is adapted from
a pamphlet distributed by the
American Civil Liberties
Union.Certain crucial information
has been added. Remember that
criminal procedure is complex
and’ constantly changing. Listed
are commonly asked questions
that may arise after being stopped

Humane effort needed in Middle East

on the problems plaguing the
Middle East today closed out

series of events designed to
promote cultural understanding
among ethnic groups.

The seminar, entitled “A View

was led by Rabbi Joseph H.

Hillel Foundation. Levine
discussed possible solutions to
the ongoing conﬂict.

The seminar began with a video

“[The planning committee]

According to Dana Keefer of

attendance was particularly high
at thei’l¢perimg ceremonies and
displ‘ays,lwhe_re there were 300 to
500 people intheaudience, and
at the speech given by Yolanda
King, for which there was an
audience of about 300 people.

Another popular event,
according to Cavalla, was the
Leningrad Youth Choir concert
for which the audience packed
into Heinz Chapel.

Keefer said the more
unstructured events were popular
as well because people could
attend them between classes more
easily.

“We tend to get more people at
the international food festival and
the musical concerts because you
can come and go,” she said.

to these events.

Levine then related some of his
personal experiences in the

of one situation in which Arab
and Israeli children are brought
together in a summer camp setting
to foster understanding among
ethnic groups.

“If you can break through on a

cooperation with the Office of

The multi—prong project's main
objective is to build a coalition
between Israelis and Arabs.
According to Levine, one of the
best ways to solve existing
problems is to work on a “human
interpersonal level.”

“As Amos Elon, a famous
author said, ‘It is not so much the
problem of who is right and who
is wrong, but of who is wrong of
two rights,”’ he said.

Pitt is partially to blame for the
problems she is having.

Although the festival is officially

BAS plans publication of journal, ‘survival kit’

By Mindy Boffemmyer

A Managing Editor

Two new projects designed to
encourage and assist Pitt’s black students
have been proposed by this year’s Black
Action Society steering committee.

The BAS is currently planning to publish
two books geared toward serving the
interests of black students at Pitt.

The first book will be a journal containing
the writings of black Pitt students,
according to BAS Deputy Chairperson
Marta Effinger.

“That’s one of my pet projects this year:
[doing] a scholarly journal made up of
papers that students [write],’’ Efﬁnger said.

Each member of the BAS steering
committee has at least one individual
project to work on this year, according to
BAS Chairperson Doug Ligons.

“We have the black-studies departrnent’s
cooperation with this. We are proposing to
encourage writing among black students
here at Pitt [by asking] them to submit the
papers that they do in the black—studies
department, [such as] a scholarly paper, an
essay or a creative—writing paper, and have

the professor encourage them to submit it
to a journal,” Efﬁnger said.

The journal is tentatively scheduled to
come out once a semester, she said.

“People will be encouraged by seeing
that their work is in something like that.
Hopefully we’re going to be able to send it
out not just to the Pittsburgh community
but to universities all across the country,”
she said. “But first we want to see how
responsive people are," she said.

The second book will be a “survival kit”
for black students who attend Pitt and will
include listings of places where black

students can get their hair cut or purchase
African jewelry and clothing, according to
Efﬁnger."

“You can't get those things [easily] here
in Oakland," she said.

“That way we are going to have some
black businesses where black students can
go, and they will know there are other
black communities and other black
businesses other than in Oakland,” she
said. “They can get out into the community
and into the Pittsburgh area, like the Hill,

Pitt students, providing they

adding that he will arrive

15 minutes.

The taxi is in service Monday

Pitt freshmen abandoned...

The University of Pittsburgh promises its freshmen and
transfer students housing. Unfortunately, this does not
necessarily mean that they will be housed on the Pitt
campus.

Approximately 40 Pitt students are currently being
housed in dormitories on the Carlow College campus.

These students have to live under Carlow rules, not Pitt"

rules.
For example, in the Carlow dormitories, students are not
permitted to have guests of the opposite sex in -their

r09ms..bs:fore  pm ~ or latter. .1.1._.p.-.m.... ..  .

 Pitt students who live at Carlow aire.‘also”forcedltol
buy Carlow meal plans. This is simply a waste of money

for these students, many of whom only use the Carlow“

plan for their dinner. .  .

This means that, should these students choose to eat an
afternoon meal, they either have to make a daily trek back
to the Carlow cafeterias or spend even more money to pay
for meals here. This is a needless waste of time and
money. k

Because these students are inconvenienced, the least
that Pitt could do would be to allow them the benefit of
eating at Pitt’s cafeterias and restaurants at some sort of
discount.

Carlow College is a Catholic school. Pitt is a public
university. But the Pitt students who are housed at Carlow
are forced to live with students who have chosen to attend
a religiously oriented college, instead of with students like
themselves who have chosen to attend a public school.

Pitt says that the students who live at Carlow are there
because they have turned in paper work late. Yet it is the
university’s own clerical errors that cause many of these
students to live on the wrong campus.

All of these Pitt students must adhere to the Carlow

‘residence-hall rules. Their major complaint should not be

with Carlow but with their own university.

Included in the university’s promise to provide food and
shelter to its students should be the understanding that
these necessities will be granted on their own campus.

 Keep AIDS patients at Godspeed

When individuals commit a
crime, they are (more often than
not) taken to a court of law
where well-respected judges
decide upon a punishment that
fits the crime. Most of the time,
the public feels that the guilty get
off too easily — and many times
they do. On the other hand,
people who have broken the law
(but are not hurting anyone by
doing so) are handed a relatively
stiff punishment.

James Flanagan and Joseph
Bauer have recently been evicted
from an apartment they (and a
few other people) share because
they unknowingly violated the
lease that was ﬁled with the
landlord of the building. Sounds
simple, right? Not quite. Flanagan
and Bauer have AIDS. They were
both recently taken in by a one-
woman foundation called
Godspeed House which cares for
AIDS-infected individuals with
nowhere else to go. Kathleen
Coyne, founder of Godspeed
House, signed a lease with her
landlord last September that stated
that no more than one individual
shall live in the apartment at any
one time. Godspeed House has
taken in six diseased men since
then.

Coyne was taken to Common

Pleas Court by her landlord
recently, and Districtjustice Mark
Devlin approved the eviction.
Normally this case would not
bother me as much as it does,
except for one simple fact: Bauer
has only three weeks to live. It
seems that no matter how much
the public is educated about AIDS,
we never learn anything. Justice

Lisa
 Raff 

should not be optional in cases of
people with AIDS, it should be
mandatory. Joseph Bauer
deserves the right to die where
he wants — and he has chosen
Godspeed House.

I’ve always been an advocate
of human rights for persons with
AIDS. l’ve cried through countless
articles in People Weekly, sat and
watched a three—hour special on
the stitching of the tremendous
quilt devoted to victims of AIDS
by their loved ones, and, of
course, watched Ryan White’s
televised funeral this past summer,
crying for almost an hour.

There have been so many news
events, television dramas, made-
for—cable movies, and magazine
and news articles explaining the
threat of AIDS and how it can and
can't be transmitted. It's sad that
only a small part of the population
was listening, and that people (in
general) can . be so cruel and
uncaring to victims who seriously

" ‘need medical’ and emotional

attention.

Godspeed House has until Oct.
2 to file an appeal on Devlin’s
decision. If they do not ﬁle, all
tenants of Godspeed House will
be left on their own to die. Can a
court of law which prides itself
on justice destroy what emotional
strength these men have left?
Godspeed House is doing the
right thing -— if only our justice
system could do the same.

Although it has never been
stated on the record that these
men are being evicted due to
their disease, itwouldbe ludicrous
to think that AIDS has nothing to
do with the fervency at which
this case is being pursued. James
Flanagan and Joseph Bauer.have
been dealt a bad hand — now it’s
time to see that they get a fair
shake.

Tran takes charge on soccer team

By Doug Miller ‘
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Just ask the members of the Pitt
soccer team who they’ll count on
this year to shoulder the scoring
load. Out of most of their mouths
will be heard two words: Huy
(pronounced Whee) Tran.

Tran, last year’s leading scorer,
currently leads the scoring race
for this year’s squad. However,
he is the consummate team player.

There are many things easier
than getting Tran to talk about
himself; one of them might be
pulling his teeth. Ask him
something about his goals for this
year, and he'll say, “Hopefully we
will get to the Big East tournament
this year.”

With the offense this year’s team
uses of having two strikers out on
the wings, goals will be difficult
to come by. But that is something
Tran thrives on. One of his jobs
as a striker is to make things
happen in front of the opposing
team’s goal.

“I like getting passes on the
ground. It’s a lot easier for me to
get them and do something with
ltheml,” said Tran. “It’s pretty hard
for me to get up over defenders
and goalies.”

That’s easy to understand, as
he stands only 5 feet, 9 inches
and weighs 155 pounds. He
competes with defenders and
goalkeepers who are usually over
6 feet tall and who outweigh him
by 40 pounds.

The sophomore biology major
dissects other team’s defenses
with his speed and anticipation
of where the ball is going to pop
up next.

“The team wants me to get out
on the left wing so that I can be
isolated with just one player and
then go to the goal. That way I
only have to beat one of the
defenders,” said Tran.

However, Tran rarely gets
marked by just one defender, as
teams know he was Pitt’s leading
scorer and most dangerous
offensive threat last year.

That might well have been
Vi1lanova’s shortcoming this past
Saturday, as defender Scott
McCurry and midfielder Ivan
Amayo toasted the Wildcat
defenders with a goal apiece.

“If teams try [to] double—team
me, we have guysthat will make
them pay for it. There are plenty
of guys who can score on this
team,” Tran said.

See Tran, page 8

Paul Diamond/The "Pitt News

Huy Tran's intensity has made him the Panther's leading scorer.

Damn, it’s cold out! What
happened to the summer?
Ahh  summer. I had no
classes to skip, no term
papers to stay up all night
writing and no tests to cram
for. I only studied the
baseball box scores in the
morning paper. And during
the whole summer, the
same team was on the top
of the standings. Those
pesky Pittsburgh Pi—rats.

Well, those days are long
gone. There is a chill in the
air now to replace the
warmth of the sun. There
are classes to replace my
summer job. And there are
the New York Mets to
replace the Bucs.

Showdown One. We were
lucky enough to get tickets
way up in the nosebleed
section from a Pi-rat fan for
only a few bucks. The man
almost didn’t let us buy
them because I. was
wearing my treasured Mets
jersey — a move that I
would later learn to regret.

I got sneers and jeers

Tennis team takes sixt/9 at Big East

By Paul Tatkovski
Sta17‘FVrlter 7

They say that success is a
relative term. Well, hopefully
the men's tennis team will
compare this weekend’s tie for
sixth place in the Big East
tourney with the football team's
performance at Oklahoma.

It wasn’t that bad.

In fact, head coach George
Dieffenbach said he wasn’t
disappointed with his team's
effort.

“They played very
consistently and never gave up,”
said Dieffenbach.

He explained that there is
more parity in the Big East
now. “One trend I noticed is
that the league is getting deeper.
There is no one dominant team

anymore."

This would explain the
lackluster fourth-place finish of
Georgetown, last year’s
champion. Boston College won
this year’s tournament, its tenth
championship in the .league’s
12—year history. Dieffenbach
added that while the league is
more balanced, “the Big East
has a long way to go [to be
successful] on the national
level."

The top six singles players
and the top three doubles teams
from each school competed this
weekend in Weekapaug, R.I.

Those players who lost in the
first round were put in a
consolation bracket. A win in
the main draw was worth two
points, while a consolation win
earned a team one point.

Pitt tied Seton Hall for sixth
by tallying eight points, six
points shy of their fifth—place
finish last season.

Pitt’s No. 3 singles player,
John T egano, provided two of
those points with a main-draw
win over Tony Zorovich of
Seton Hall 6-4, 7-5. No. 4 Jeff
Mills beat Greg Bartek of
Connecticut in the first round
6-4, 6-4 before losing.

The No. 2 doubles team of
Eric Weaver and David Ginder
won the consolation final over
Mark Pizzi and Dan Daros of
Villanova 6-4, 4-6, 7-6.

The Panthers will open a
homestand with Duquesne
today followed by Carnegie
Mellon on Oct. 1. Dieffenbach
said the toughest part of the
schedule will be in the spring.

Tran

Continued from page 7

Last year Tran was a walk—on. This year he is receiving a partial’ 

scholarship.

“I came in a little late last year and wanted to prove to my teammates
that I was a good player. As far as Coach Uoe] Luxbacher [is
concerned], I think he realized I might be able to contribute in some
way to the team," said Tran.

Tran claims that he doesn’t feel any pressure from his teammates
to score all the time. “I really don’t think the team puts any pressure
on me, but I really enjoy the pressure that I put on myself to score,”
said T ran. “It makes me work that much harder to come up with
something original to beat the defenders.” That almost sounds like
something Mario Iernieux would say.

So is there a new magician in Pittsburgh? You can answer that for
yourself tomorrow night when the West Virginia Mountaineers will
be entertained by the Panthers in Pitt Stadium at 7:30.

West Virginia plays a hard brand of soccer, using physical playand
intimidation as two of their weapons. However, Tran will show off

a little bit of his prep-school (Erie Cathedral Prep) upbringing. This I

past weekend he almost decapitated the Villanova goalkeeper with
a shot that bounced off the goalkeeper and over the crossbar.

Tran possesses a lightning-quick, left—footed shot that he likes to
use in a fluid sweeping motion with a defender behind him, using the
defender as a screen against the goalie.

“I like being right in the middle of the action. I think that quickness,
not so much speed, plays an important part in front of the goal,” said
Tran. “You never know where the ball might pop up, and that’s when
you have to be able to put a good, solid shot on goal.”

The Panthers certainly hope that the ball pops up on Tran’s feet
because they might just be the feet that take them to their ultimate

THE P111‘ NEWS, Tuesday, September 18, 1990

 

Mets

Continued from page 7

felt so alone. I did not expect to

be greeted with loving arms at
Three Rivers, especially with what
I was wearing, but I thought that
Pi—rat fans had more class. During
one of the fights that broke out
(not involving me) an intoxicated
idiot yelled, “Go back to all the
[jerks] in the rotten apple if you
want to light. We don’t do that in
Pittsburgh. Hey, New York, Iraq
—— same thing!” Being a native of
New York, I took that a little
personally. Ask anyone, I ’m not a
jerk, but don’t quote me on that.

What really struck me was the
way Darryl Strawberry was

' V booed. No matter what he did, it

caused a stir. The cheers were as
loud for a Bucco base hit as they
were for a Strawberry strike out.
But I had my revenge when
Strawberry hit a solo home run in
the second game. It was so quiet,
I thought I was in church.

I didn’t know it at the time, but
that was to be my only highlight.
As it became apparent that the
Mets were going to lose, the fans
got more hostile. People went
out of their way to make me feel
like a pile of puke. “Muck the

' Fets” rang in my head all night. I

wondered if I could trade my
beer for a bottle of vodka. I felt
like the ugly duckling as my
friends and I were leaving the
stadium.

My friend Todd told me I had ‘

guts for wearing that shirt to the

game. My friend Tom called me .
stupid. I proudly held my head

. 2 hr. Service

up high while walking through
the parking lot on the way to the
car —mainly because it is easier
to duck punches that way. A
drunken baseball wench told me
to Muck the Fets and then spit at
me. As I was driving out of the
parking lot, a mob of husky young
men pounded on my car as if I
was the ousted leader of a Third
World nation. And there were
more birds ﬂipped in my direction
than there are in the Pittsburgh
Zoo. All this because I am a
transplanted Mets fan.

Well, it's two weeks later. The
Pi-rats have lost five games in a
row; the Mets are only a half
game back, and my psyche has
healed. The Mets play the Bucs
again on Oct. 1-3, and I’ll be there
wearing my favorite shirt. I'm
even working on my new war
cry, Buck the Fucs!

Steelers

. THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Tuesday, September 18, 1990
H 

Continued from page 7

In the first quarter, the Steelers
ran three plays and punted on
three of their four possessions.
Brister went 1-5 passing and
racked up minus four yards.

At the half, the Steelers had a
zero—percent, third—down
efficiency rating. Not good.

“We’re not playing good,"
Worley said. “We can’t expect
the defense to bail us out every

week. I don’t know what the
problem is.”

Perhaps the problem is Joe
Walton’s offensive plan, which
Brister, after the Browns’ game,
complained was too complicated.
However, that seems slightly
unlikely.

Walton’s scheme was simplified
before the Cleveland game to
accommodate Brister’s and other
players’ wishes. No matter how

complicated the offensive plan
may be in the playbook, the
Steelers still could not effectively
run up the middle or off—tackle
against the Oilers.

“We’re going to have to take a
look at films and determine the
problem and make some
adjustments from there,” Coach
Chuck Noll said.

You mean changes, Chuck?

“I didn’t say that,” he said.

In this team’s development
under a new offensive
coordinator, things will take time.
Brister’s questioning the game
plan doesn’t help much. Instead
of asking questions, maybe he
should spend his time studying
the playbook.

After two games, the coaching
staff should have ample time to
ﬁgure out the holes in the offense
after “looking at the f1lrns,” which
is their answer to every question,
insinuating that there is some
kind of problem in any aspect of
the game. They’ll probably be
watching mighty hard this week.

This writer has faith in Chuck
Noll. What he has done with this
team over the years, especially
last year, has been absolutely
remarkable. It remains to be seen
what this man and his staff can
do in the coming season.

It is certainly not time to be
calling for anyone’s scalp in this
city. ,
