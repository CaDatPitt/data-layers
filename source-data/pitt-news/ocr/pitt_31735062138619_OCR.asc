"University will be held on Tuesday ’

By MARGARET MALANOS .
AIS Richard Kay, Squadron A,
has found the formula for making
friends and inﬂuencing people. It is
very simple: merely graduate from
the University of Pittsburgh, join
the Army, and be sent back to Pitt
as a member of the 60th C.T.D.
There you have the groundwork for
coming in contact with a group of
people who know nothing about
Pittsburgh while you know it all
( ? ). '
Kay says his fellow crass mates
ask him questions ranging from
the heights of the buildings to
wherethe cheapest and best beer
can I; bought. (Kay admits that ,
he knows nothing about the latter
inquiry. but he’s always willing
to learn). So far he has been
very happy to help his buddies,
but he has suddenly come to the
realization that his store of
knowledge might come in handy
in pickingup a little extra money.
You know, “Right this way, ladies
and gentlemen, shoe leather ex-
press for a tour of the high spots
of the “Smoky City," leaving im- '
mediately after the next weather
report.” Oneof the most popular
questions asked of this former
Pitt student is “What was here
(meaning the barracks) before
the army came?” Then, Kay cud-
gels his brain and thinks way
back to when he was a civilian and
gives out with the information.

now with the way it was before his

[VS Kay, Pitt Grad, Finds

SAE house and was wakened every
morning at 8 o'clock by the colored
attendant, Brother Al. When Kay
protested that it wasn't fair to have
to get up at such an hour, Brother
Al invariably said, “Maybe it's
hard, but it's fair.” He can well re-
member those words of wisdom now
when reville is heard over the loud
speakers at 5:45.

Kay worked on the “Pitt News”
staﬂ’ as an undergraduate and'did
he have fun!! He also worked on
the “The Panther” stall’, the
humor magazine, which has since
been discontinued.

All in all, Kay says it's much
easier to be sent back to your old
school than to another school, be-
cause you are already used to the

ing and can go right ahead and
learn while the other fellows are
trying to decipher the lectures. It
also makes it much pleasanter if
your wife lives in Pittsburgh, as
Kay's does.
