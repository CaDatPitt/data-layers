Improvement, Over 1933-34;
15 Organizations Listed

 

The scholastic averages for men’s
social fraternities for the school year
1934-1935 show that for the ﬁrst time
in the history of such records no
group had an average of below 1.00.
Headed ‘by Phi Epsilon P1, with the
average ‘or 1.634, the ‘soeial fra-
ternities ended ‘the year with the
quality point average of 1.296.

This record includesithe 13 mem-
bers of Interfraternity Council and
two social groups which do not be-
long to Council. Including ” the three
professional fraternities whose aver-
age is 1.524, the all-fraternity aver-
age for men’s groups is 1.312, which
is an increase of .067 over last year’s
record.”

The quality point average for each
group is computed by taking the sum
of the credits for the fraternity and
dividing into this ﬁgure the total num-
ber of credits which the members of
the organization carry.

The scholarship plaque, awarded
annually by the Interfraternity Coun-
cil to the house having the highest
scholastic average, will be presented
to Phi Epsilon Pi.

Law Club Head,
Announces Plans

Three Advisers To Replace One;
Group Admits First Woman

After an extensive internal reor-
ganization, John Marshall Club, hon-
orary pre-legal fraternity, announced
Friday its plans for the current school
year through its president, Frank
Reich, C36.

Under the new arrangement, John
Marshall Club will have three advis-
ers instead of the former one. Dr.
Roger V. -Shumate, instructor in po-

litical science, will serve as adviser

to members in the choice of courses
in preparation for law. James B.
Blackburn, assistant professor of law,
through whom it is hoped the mem-
bers may become acquainted with the
Law School faculty, will serve as Law
School representative.

According to Reich, Mr. Blackburn
will be adviser to members against
the pitfalls of Law School as well as
in State examinations.

The third adviser is Miles H. Jones,
assistant professor of business law,
who has been the club's adviser for
the past few years. Mr. Jones will
serve as an adviser in the practical
and theoretical side of law.

In addition to Reich, the officers
for the year are Lloyd Gluck, C36,
vice president, and Emanuel Krupp,
BA36, secretary-treasurer.

Departing from tradition, the John
Marshall group for the ﬁrst time has
admitted a woman to its ranks. The
ﬁrst woman member is Sarah Reish,
036. In the past, women were exclud-
ed, but in view of the number of wo-
men going into law school, the con-
stitution was amended to admit wo-
men.

‘News’ To Stage Annual
Style Show And Dance

The Pitt News will stage its an-
nual fall and winter Style Show and
dance in the ballroom of the Hotel
Schenley on Wednesday afternoon,
October’ 23. The time ‘will be from
2:45 to 6:30 o’clock; the admission is
free.

This event, sponsored by The News
and several of its advertisers, fea-
tures the latest campus fashions for
both men and women. Models, bal-
loting for which will take place
through the columns of The News in
the early future, are exclusively Pitt
students. Fifteen coeds and 15 men
will participate.

“Door prizes will be given again,”

‘says Ellis H. Tumpson, manager of

The News and chairman of the show,
“but I promise, brothers of ODK.
sister Newsites, etc.,
are ineligible.” ' '

‘News’ office Disapaeaarremsoz;
Biddle And ‘General’ Grant Smile

A sophomore reporter from Clair-
ton, returning to start another year’s
work with The Pitt "News, walked in-
to Room 801, Cathedral late yester-
day and collapsed.

“Before passing out,” it was learned
the fellow had remarked in the jargon
of his trade, “all that I have to say
for publication is ‘Oh, my'!"’

of the sam‘e‘ro'oI‘n“and reacl1"a tele-

ian of men’s activities. "‘It’s goI_ie,’.’
li'e‘"told Ted in “a voice quavering over
the wire. ‘ 1' " "
“‘What’s gone?” asked Ted rhetoric-

ally. .
“The News office; it's gone!”
blurted out the caller. '

“You don't mean to tell me!” What
followed ‘was a hedge-podge of ' ex-
pressions ‘sash as “Wheels!” “Oh-
boy’’ and a couple of very rollicking
choruses of: _ ’ ’ ' "

“Happy days; are here again

In the office of the dean of men.’.’

The junior hung up. “Maybe,” he
told himself, “I’ve had too much regis-
tr,ati_on.”

sure ‘enough, ‘Room 801, Cathedral
is today" as bare as old Mother lHub-
bard’s cupboard." Not only The News,
but all other student activities having
locations there have folded up their

case anyone is‘ interested, they can
?be found in Room 709, just down one

But the fellow who got the biggest
kick out of it all was'Mr'. U. S. Grant,
direct descendant "of General ‘Ulysses

the Cathedral's “General.” In between

F reshimen, 1-eaders Return 
From ‘Greatest’ Week-End

 

A group of approximately 175 freshmen and upperclass counselors, the

largest number since the inception of

the Freshman Camp institution ﬁve,

years ago, returned yesterday afternoon from Camp Kon-O-Kwee, near Zelien-

ople, Pa.

"W. W. Mendenhall, secretary of the campus YMCA, which sponsors the ‘

program, said concerning the latest retreat: “Most of the fellows ‘think it
was great, and I believe it was the best yet. Freshman Camp is designed to

give beginning freshmen a more com _¢
prehensive idea of the phases of .a
college education. In my opinion, the
fellows who attended will ﬁnd that
they have a considerable advantage
over those who have not availed them-
selves ‘of the campaign privilege.”
Campers left the Y Hut in private
automobiles and a chartered bus Fri-_
day afternoon at 2:30 o'clock. High
spots of the day included a swimming
and recreation period, an address by
Dr. Louis H. Evans in the evening:

cessful College -Career,” a game of In-
dian Settler, and a special ice cream
treat.

“Students or Robots”. was the title
of an address by Mr. Mendenhall at
Saturday morning chapel. This was
followed’ by a panel discussion of fra-
ternities under the leadership of N.
Robert Seidle, assistant dean of men.
In the evening, a campﬁre gathering
featured an amateur hour, informal
talks by Dr. Samuel H. Williams and
Dr. H. C. Carlson, and group singing.

A second chapel service was held
Sunday morning under the leadership
of Mr. Mendenhall. Sunday’s special
attraction was a conference with
deans of the various schools;

Faculty leaders who attended were:
Robert D. Ayers, professor of account-
ing; Theodore W. Biddle, assistant
dean of men; William S. Brinker, fac-
ulty adviser to the Engineering Asso-
ciation; Dr. S. P. Franklin, professor
of education; Dr. E. A.‘ Holbrook, dean
of the School of Engineering and
Mines; Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean

Hugh Wing, instructor in English;
Paul Zehfuss, assistant basketball
coach; Dr. ‘H. C. Carlson, director of
Student Health Service and instructor

NYA ToAid 515,
Directors Declare

Students Employed In Projects
May Earn $15 Average

Approximately 575 students doing

undergraduate work on campus will

be aided with government money this
year, University directors of the Na-
tional Youth Administration indicated
at registration last week.

Leading the work llereﬂwill be Miss
Isabelle Anderson, assistant dean of
women, and J. G. Quick, University
registrar. They replace Dr. Stanton
C. Crawford, who has been appointed
dean of the College.

Under the terms of the govern-
mental grant, each college or univer-
sity is entitled to employ 12 per cent
of its undergraduates with United
States funds, at work which does not
conﬂict with that already being" car-
ried on. Assistance to all students
will average $15 each month, although
certain men and women may earn
as much as $20. The size of the month-
ly wage will depend upon the need
of the applicant.

The NYA, which was legalized last
summer with a $50,000,000 appropria-
tion, replaces the college division of
the Federal Emergency Relief Admin-
istration, the FERA,which helped stu-
dents here last year.

Graduates may also beneﬁt from the
new body, which offers employment
at a maximum of $45 a month to men
and women ‘holding bachelors’ de-
grees. Information is available from
Miss Anderson and J. Clyde Barton,
director of the Men’s_ Placement Bu-
reau. Applications may be ﬁled in
Heinz House and in Room 801, Ca-
thedral.

Greet The Green
ETURNING TO THE CAMPUS today, upper-
R, classmen are seeing green. The armbands
worn by freshman women have long been a
tradition at the University. The neat buttons pin-
ned to several hundreds of coat lapels are some-
thing new. Those buttons are the ﬁrst step in the
Student Faculty As_sociation’s program of customs
for freshman men.

The green armband and the green button are
much more than mere decorations to members of
the freshman class. A well-planned and well-exe-
cuted program of Freshman Week events has seen
to that. Now, it is hoped, upperclassmen will rec-
ognize these symbols as something more than deco-
rations.

Every man with the button and every woman
with the armband represents a newcomer to Uni-
versity life. Each of them is going through the
same trials of getting acquainted and accustomed
to new surroundings as did all of us one, two, or
three years ago.

There are few ﬁner things an upperclassmen can
do than attempt to make these freshmen feel at
home. The rush between classes is not too hasty
but that there is always time to say “Hello” to
those freshmen you meet. Nor is it too much of a
bother to be particularly cordial to these new peo-
ple when you see them downtown, in the street car,
or when you are eating lunch. Every day they are
facing new problems, new ways of doing things,
new questions. It goes without saying that any
part which upperclassmen can play.to aidin these
adjustments will be appreciated by the freshmen.
A fair trial is all that it should take to convince
the sophomores, juniors, and seniors that oﬁering
such help pays its own dividends.

It has been a long time since upperclassmen at
the University have considered it a duty to meet
freshmen with paddling and hazing and derision’;
it yet remains our duty to meet them with a smile
and a word of greeting.

Watch then for the green armbands and the
green buttons. By these signs you shall know the
freshmen; by your kindness and by your actions
that are cordial they shall know the friendliness
of a great University.

 

Those who heard the band play the "Star-Spangled
Banner” at last week’s Freshman Banquet are convinced
that the Band is out to break all records for excellence
this year. Maybe there’s a scent of orange blossoms in
the air.

The Meaiiest Thief

TORIES ABOUT the most mean of thieves, those who

rob chi1dren’s banks, are put somewhat to shame by

an incident which occurred on the campus during regis-
tration week.

An out-of-town student hurried into registration head-
quarters, leaving unlocked his automobile in which were
all his clothes and equipment for the school year. He
ﬁnished registration some hours later and came out to
ﬁnd car, clothes, everything he had, gone. The fee at

registration had left him virtually down to his last few ‘

dollars and the predicament in which this young man
found himself was something a great deal more than
embarrassing.

It is unfortunate that any University or college located

near or in a large city must be subject to such practices .

of stealing. Any student who drives a car must not for-
get this, and never should he leave his automobile un-
locked, even for a short time. _

Particularly in the more remote sections of the campus
have students had articles stolen from unlocked cars.
The regularity of class schedules makes it easy for a
thief to learn just how long a student will be away and
the stealing becomes a simple process.

Losses of almost tragic degree, such as the one sus-
tained by the fellow last week, are fortunately very rare.
But it is certainly wise for a driver to make certain
when he parks his car that not only will he avoid a
tag, but also that all doors of his car are locked.

Milligan’s Yearling Gridmen
Settle Down To Hard Work

Four Games Scheduled Thus Far For Freshman Eleven;
Coaches Ready To Welcome More Candidates ,

By Edwin H. Beachler.
\Vhile most freshmen spent their spare time exercising their legs
on campus steps and walks or playing at camp near Zelienople, 26
men from the class of ’39 sweltered in heavy football equipment on

the Trees Gymnasium ﬁeld.

The Little Panthers open up with the Carnegie Tech Fresh on
Saturday, October 12. Then on Friday, October 25, a fast Kiski prep
eleven plays host to the local squad. State College is the scene of the

third game on alien territory, as the
Nittany cubs and Pitt yearlings tangle
Saturday, November 2. Armistice Day,
November 11, will be a cease-ﬁring
signal for the Pitt freshmen with the
Mountaineer frosh of West Virginia
providing the opposition at Connells-
ville, Pa.

According to the present schedule,
it is unlikely that the ﬁrst-year men
will perform before the local fans.
For, with all four games scheduled for
alien territory, it is quite unlikely that
another contest will be added to the
present grid card, according to Milli-
gan. ~

Approximately 15 boys are in fairly
good shape, with the others rapidly
approaching their faster-stepping team-
mates. Milligan is favorably impressed
with the entire _squad—especially in
the backﬁeld department. Goldberg,
southpaw halfback from Elkins, West
Virginia, has the stuﬂ for one of the
backﬁeld positions.

Others of more than ordinary cal-
ibre include Chickerne, signal-barker
from Warren, Pa., Stebbins, halfback
from Williamsport, Pa., and Bill ‘Dad-
die, hefty fullback from Meadville,
Pa. Milligan hopes to convert this
boy into a center, if possible. —

Guard material appears to be quite
plentiful, with Raskowski, one of Phil
Bridenbaugh’s mainstays at New Cas-
tle High, Petro, Johnstown High star,
Kegal, from South High, and Merkov-
ski, of Johnny Reed’s WPIAL class
“A” Scott High championship eleven,
in the foreground. It is possible that
Merkovski might be switched to a
tackle position.

Sabitch, husky tackle from Wilkes-
Barre, in the district that sent up Izzy
Weinstock and George Shotwell, of
last year’s eastern championship
eleven, is another likely prospect. Dan-
nes, Westmont High center, and Hoff-
man, Central Catholic tackle, also a
possibility at a terminal position, are
others on the squad to attract atten-
tion.

Milligan, of course, has not yet
made a deﬁnite ﬁrst-class lineup.
With all positions open, he anticipates
a larger squad turn-out starting to-
day, at 3:30 o’clock. Equipment is be-
ing issued at the Stadium ofﬁce. All
football candidates and also all those
interested .in a .managerial -.position-
should report to the stadium as soon
as possible.

Harvey Rooker, stellar end on Pitt
teams for the last three seasons, will
assist Milligan, who begins his ﬁrst
season at the helm of the ﬁrst-year
Panthers. Coach M'illigan succeeds Dr.
“Skip” Gougler, mentor in 1934.

Freshmen Meet
Panther Coaches

Harrison Presides At Athletic
Assembly In Memorial Hall

 

“Above all, hit the ball in the class-
room,” advised W. D. Harrison, Direc-
tor of Athletics, in a speech deliv-
ered to the freshman men students
gathered in Memorial Hall last Wed-
nesday afternoon for the Freshman
Week athletic assembly.

Director Harrison, acting as master
of ceremonies, introduced to the
freshmen the coaches of the various
sports on the Panther athletic pro-
gram.

Before giving the coaches a chance
to speak, Mr. Harrison delivered a
brief address concerning the relation-
ship of athletics to the student’s
school life.

Dr. H. C. Carlson, basketball coach,
recommended participation in the
freshman basketball tournament
which gets under way in October.
Carl Olson, varsity track coach, urged
all ﬁrst year men to sign up for the
coming all-University track and ﬁeld
meet on October 16 and 17.

Other members of the University
athletic staff present at the meeting
were Patrick J. Corr, swimming
coach; Captain Kleinman, riﬂe men-
tor; Regis Wolﬁ, golf coach; Jack
Schricker, boxing instructor; Earl
Oster wrestling coach; Mike Milligan,
freshman football coach; and Dr. Paul
Zehfuss, assistant basketball coach.

After the coaches had delivered
their remarks to the body, the fresh-
men got their ﬁrst opportunity to meet
personally the men who make Pitt’s
athletic history,

RESERVE SYSTEM

Pitt Eleven Resumes Drills
Today On Practice Gridiron

 

Returning to its lzome ﬁeld after a two-weeks training season at Camp
Hamilton, the Panther football team will start its last week of practice today
in preparation for the opening game of the 1935 season with ‘Waynesburg
next Saturday afternoon at the Stadium. P

Losing nine regulars from last year’s eleven, Coach Jock Sutherland has
had to re-shape virtually a new varsity machine for this season, and Satur-
day’s test with the Yellow Jackets will give Sutherland an opportunitly to

see his new lineup in genuine action.0

With most of the new players from
his 1934 reserve teamreturning to the
fold, and with several promising soph-
omores standing out in the training
camp workouts, Coach Sutherland will
probably send out on the Stadium turf
a team mixed with a few experienced
veterans and a number of green, in-
experienced ﬁrst-year gridders.

111 the scrimmages at Camp Hamil-
ton, Coach Sutherland repeatedly jock-
eyed his starting team around to in-
clude several yearling stars.

At the terminal posts Frank Sou-
chak, a sophomore, a11d Verne Bax-
ter, a veteran, appear to have the
edge. Baxter was injured in practice
last week but will probably be at his
post when the Panthers clash with
the Yellow Jacket tribe. Paul
“Bomber” Shaw, another sophomore,
was used at Baxter's position when
the latter was forced to the sidelines
with an injury. Vin Sites and Eddie
Quarantillo, holdovers from last year,
are still very much in the ﬁght for
starting jobs.

A newcomer, George Delich, seems
to be a likely starter at one of the
tackle posts. Ave Daniell, junior let-
terman, will probably hold down the
other tackle berth. Replacements will
come from Art Detzel, who is still

Losing three stellar guards in Hart-
wig, Ormiston and Kutz, Coach Suth-
erland will have to call upon his re-
serve material from last year and a
couple of sophomores. At the present
time, Bill Glassford, junior letterman,
and Dante Dalle-Tezze, a yearling can-
didate, seem to have the edge. Leon
Wolgemuth, a reserve, and Luther
Richards, sophomore husky, are press-
ing Glassford and Dalle-Tezze for
starting assignments.

Nick Klisky appears to be a ﬁxture
at the pivot position, but a pair of
sophomores, Don Hensley and Henry
Adams, are being developed to act as
alternates for the center position.

In the backﬁeld a tentative starting
quartet includes Arnold Greene at
quarterback, Bobby LaRue and Hub
Randour at halves, and another soph-
omore, Frank Patrick, at fullback.
Bobby McClure, who was shifted from
quarterback to fullback -in the spring,
has returned to his old job at the
signal-calling post and may get the
nod over Greene. Shedlosky and Sta-
pulis loom as menaces to LaRue and
Randour and are certain to see plenty

It’s the identical pen you’ve often

fore this miracle writer was born.
But none found a way to surmount
the mechanical faults of squirt-gun
piston pumps, valves, etc.

Then a scientist at the University

it because it contained no rubber sac

Research Bureau
Begins Training

Advertising Adviser, Personnel
Assistant Added To Staﬁ‘

With two new assistants added to
the staff and a class of fourteen stu-

dents enrolled, the University's Re-
search Bureau for Retail Training be-
gins its training this fall for embryo
executives in Pittsburgh department
stores.

The two assistants are Adelaide
Hunter, of the advertising depart-
ment of a downtown store, and Edith
Jamieson, graduate of Vassar.

Miss Hunter will teach advertising
while Miss Jamieson’s teaching sched-
ule includes salesmanship, training,
and personnel administration. Miss
Jainieson attended the Leland Tower
School of Expression and the Prince
School for Store Service Education.

Students enrolled in the Bureau are
Betty Ashe, from the University of
Miami; Annabelle Bartlett, Alma
Blessing, Frances Hall, and Margaret
Watters, from Carnegie Tech; Jean
Charters, Esther !Howe, Gretchen
Welch, and Allen Wilkoff, from the
University; John Dom, from Buck-
nell; Elizabeth Hancock and Jane
Hunger, from West Virginia; Kath-
erine Murray, from Mount Holyoke;
and Lillian Wilson, from Pennsyl-
vania College for Women. Besides
these, seven department store workers
have enrolled for courses.

These students were selected for
their excellent college records, their
outstanding personalities, and their
forcefulness. ‘They have spent at
least two months obtaining actual ex-
perience in various stores immediate-
ly prior to their registration. During
this time they drew’ up a set of ques-
tions to be used as a background for
their course. ‘

The Bureau puts its pupils through
many of the practical experiences
which they will have in stores after
graduation. They spend three days
at classes and three days in Pitts-
burgh department stores. They learn
to sell, they learn to supervise sell-
ing, they learn to plan and analyze
advertising. In addition, they are
taught to plan, to act, and to control
their work.

Woman Receives
Business Award
For First Time

For the ﬁrst time since the Pitts-
burgh chapter o_f Beta Gamma Sigma,
honorary business administration fa-
ternity, has been awarding its annual
medal to the outstanding freshman in
the Business Administration School,
the award has gone to a woman, Peg-
gy Foster.

The outstanding student in the
School of Business Administration,
class of 1938, Miss Foster is a grad-
uate of Rochester High School, and
attained a quality point average of
2.9 for the school year 1934-1935.

For the years 1932-1933, the win-
ners of the award were Homer Lan-
dau and Reuben Slesinger. The win-
ner last year was Joseph H. Rodgers.

The award does not constitute mem-
bership in the society, but is merely
recognition of the scholastic stand-
ing of the highest ranking freshman
in the School of Business Administra-
tion. ~ .

Women Assigned
Senior Mentors

Weekly Discussions Scheduled
For Friday Drill Hours

Drill hours for the next eight Fri-
days are being checked off in fresh-
man women’s handbooks, as the ﬁrst
year students look forward to mentor
meetings. During these weekly meet-
ings they'll hear among other things

about fraternity life, unit system, and

University traditions from upperclass
women.

’ Lady Luck played a big part in de-
ciding whether Mary Smith would
hear about traditions from Miss Jones
or Miss Brown. At the assembly in
which the groups were assigned, on
September 19 at Heinz House, the
freshman women counted off. Each
mentor had a number, and the wo-
men drawing her number went with
her to the High Tea, their ﬁrst meet-
ing together. Here they were placed at
45 small_ tables, one for each mentor,
and hergroup.

The groups in themselves are small-
er this year, an experiment which
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women and
mentor sponsor, believes will aid not
only in making acquaintance easier,
but in facilitating college orientation
classes. The 45 mentors are assigned
only ﬁve freshmen each, although at
present all the women have not been
assigned to groups.

The mentors are: Ruth Anderson,
Mary Frances Brice, Phyllis Blumen-
feld, Eleanor Brown, Marie Bryan,
Margaret Chalmers, Anne June El-
mer, Sylvia Fixel, Anne Fell, Helen
Rose Gibson, Betty Glass, Frances
Goodwin, Sally Harris, Carolyn Hall,
Renetta Heiss, Maxine Hirsh, Grace
Keio, Louise Kelly, Rhea Klein, Mar-
garet Lewis, Virginia Luckhardt, Ruth
Lazirovitz, Margaret Lehm, Jane Lit-
tle, Virginia Long, Ola McGrail, Dor-
othy Miller, Nona Monks, Martha
M,arsh, Roberta Nern. Mary Ann
Praegner, Gertrude Reich, Thelma Rit-
ter, Alberta Russell, Margaret Speer,
Grace Siefert, Ruth Seitz, Blanche
Shore, Leah Stark, Dorothy Swearer,
Ruth Tonkin, Frances Unseld, Agnes
Wilson, and Alice W'right.

Women Observe
Custom Rulings

Green Armbands Will Be Worn
Until Examination Period

All this week the campus will be
dotted with green arm—banded wo-
men who will dodge in and out the
back doors of University buildings.
Freshman women will be observing

the annual customs regulations, and
members of the customs committee
will be on duty at Heinz House to
answer all questions about the cus-
toms rules and about the material
to be covered by the customs exam-
ination.

Passing of the customs examination,
which will be given beginning next
Monday and continuing through next
week, will entitle the freshman wo-
man to switch from the green piece
of muslin, which is her badge this
week, to a blue and gold armband.
The examination, to take place at
Heinz House, probes into the fresh-
man woman’s knowledge of Univer-
sity history, songs, cheers, names of
prominent students, and University
traditions.

Following the passing of the cus-
toms examination, the freshmen will
continue to observe rulings for the
ﬁrst six weeks of the school term,
and afterwards, if they have success-
fully complied with all regulations,
they will be awarded Merit Panther
pins, at a special assembly, Novem-
ber 22.

Customs rules, which are drawn up
by the WSGA Customs committee, are
planned to aid in identifying fresh-
men and help them in their orienta-
tion to University life.

include: Bettie Anderson, C37, chair-
man; Irene Maroney, C38; Ruth Ro-
senthal, C38; Thyrsa. Agness Amos,

ter R. Hovey, professor and acting
head of the department.

Mr. Hovey has written to the Mu-
seum of Modern Art to ﬁnd out if a

Panther Football Players Must Eat;
‘They Did,’ Says Lady Who Fed Them

 

By Charlotte Atwell.

Nine hundred slices of toast on a
stove that takes two hours to heat.
That isn't a record," but ‘it is merely
a day’s work for Mrs. Alice Wilker,
who was in charge of the kitchen at
Camp Hamilton, Windber, University
football training camp.

Life is by no means a bed of roses
for the manager of a kitchen which
undertakes to feed and satisfy a band
of 115 hungry football players, man-
agers, coaches and assistants who
make up the training camp.

Mrs. Wilker and her assistants got
up every morning at 4:30 o’clock in
order to start the ﬁre in the coal
stove, slice the bread for the melba
toast 25 loaves at a time and
squeeze by hand the four oranges for
every football player. ‘

The cooking equipment at the camp
is almost primitive, and there seems
to be no remedy for the fact. Once
an electric toaster which would toast
22 pieces of bread at a time was or-
dered and set up only to be useless
when it was discovered that the elec-
tricity at the camp was not strong
enough to run it.

Mrs. Wilker, who has managed the
University cafeteria for 19 years, and
her eight assistants worked approxi-

nounced by Katheryn Hardy, C37.

tributed at a lawn party luncheon that
has been scheduled for the junior
class calendar for next week. The
exact date and details of the luncheon
will be announced after an executive
dinner meeting tomorrow night at
Heinz House.

May Continue Movies

and artistic organizations throughout
the country. The recent success of
the Fine ‘Arts department’s movie
venture was instrumental in the deci-
sion to establish this library, accord-
ing to Mr. Hovey.

The department is anxious" to re-
ceive any student opinions in regard
to its project. Any suggestions con-
cerning the future showings and any
expressions of support’ will ‘be wel-
comed.

Students may call at or write to the
department in Room 109, State Hall.

mately 19 hours a day during train-
ing. Sundays there were 10 helpers,
and about 150 visitors for each meal.
One Sunday, with 300 orders of
chicken to cook, the stove went out.
Everything for the meal had to be
cooked in nine pots, ﬁrst one thing
ﬁnished and set aside to keep hot
and another thing put in the same
pan and cooked. Sunday tables were
decorated like banquet tables, and ice
cream and cake were served for des-
sert because there was no scrimmage
on the day’s program. _

Every Saturday 22 dozen parker
house rolls and‘25 dozen bran muf-
ﬁns were baked in the University
cafeteria and taken up to the camp
for Sunday meals.

The players were served a diet
menu during the week, amenu of fat-
less meats, vegetab_les cooked with
very little butter, beef bouillion, plain
custards and plain ice creams. Prep-
arations for the next meal are started
as soon as one meal is on the table.
Vegetables are peeled and sliced, and
every pan is covered and labeled, the
label" stating what it is and for what
meal it is to be used.

The football men return to school
today and Mrs. Wilker goes back to
the luxury of an electric toaster.
