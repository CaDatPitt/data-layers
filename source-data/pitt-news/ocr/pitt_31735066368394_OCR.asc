A defense that controlled the
tempo of the game and the offensive
re-emergence of center Andre Willi-
ams were some of the keys in the
Panther basketball team’s 72-71
upset of fourth-ranked St. John’s

last‘ night before a sellout crowd at

the Fitzgerald Field House.

Williams, who for the past several
games was missing in the offense,
scored 24 points, sharing game scor- _
ing honors with Panther forward
Clyde Vaughan. Both Williams and
Vaughan shot seven for 10 from the
floor.

According to head coach Roy
Chipman, getting the ball inside and
being patient on offense beneﬁted
Pitt. ' ,

“We didn’t take the first shot
available,” he said. “lnstead, we
wanted to get Andre, Clyde and
Trent (Johnson) into the game.”

The strategy worked well in the
second half as Pitt made 12 of 14-
shots.

The Panthers also used a variety
of defenses to keep the Redmen out
of its offensive flow.

“We wanted to keep St J ohn’s off
balance,” Chipman said.“We
wanted t-he big people up court to
break the press. We used a tempo
press to keep the big people away
from the basket.”

As usual,.the Panthers fell behind
early in the game, 5-0. But Pitt was
able to recover. » Led by short
jumpers by Vaughan and the inside
play of Williams, the Panthers were

The Jobs Are Out There, Expert Says

By D.J. CASE

“You are responsible for the qual-
ity of your work life,”Tom"Jackson,
a leading job expert, told the
audience in a packed David Law-
rence auditorium last night.

The speech, sponsored by the Pitt
Program Council, entitled “Guerilla
Tactics in the Job Market,” focused
primarily on methods one can use to
seek employment.

Jackson began ‘his speech by
emphasizing that he was not there to
entertain, create magic or whitewash
the audience. “I’m here to challenge
some basic assumptions that drive
us in the workfield," Jackson said.

A predominantly unemployed
audience listened attentively to
Jackson outline ways in which one
can search for a job, write a perfect
resume and practice pr.oper inter-
view techniques.

“We are going through a major
transition in this world,” Jackson
said. “Jobs that are phasing out are
not the kinds that utilize the most
important parts of human beings.”

The problem with this transition,
Jackson explained, is that we do not
know how to handle this explosive
change. And contrary to popular
belief, Jackson said that there is cur-
rently no shortage of jobs in our
depressed economy.

‘ “There is no inherent shortage of
jobs, there is only a shortage of peo-
ple who know how to bridge the gap
between being‘ unemployed and
finding work," he said.

of the economy than most leading
economists. Jackson believes that
the economy is a process inherently
responsive to a value, not a need.

Jackson also views the current
employmentsituation in a different

. light than most others. He displayed

his philosophy by pointing out that
if 15 percent of the population is
unemployed then 85 percent must be
employed.

“How many games in life can you

go into with 85 to 15 odds?" he hu- ‘

morously asked.

“My basic message is that every-
thing is up to you,” Jackson said.
“You have complete control over
your life; you just need to know how
to go about it.”

People believe that the most qual-
iﬁed individuals will acquire the

jobs. Jackson, however, does not

hold that belief.

“It’s not the most qualified that v ’

get the jobs, it is the ones who are
most skillful _in job‘ hunting and
know the rules of the game.”
According to Jackson, there are
five fundamental steps to take when
job hunting. The first step Jackson“
labelled “Job Target”—com"bining a

Nigerian students’ tuition and

the government of Nigeria to the
Nigerian Embassy in Washing-

these payments have not been

that the problems related to that

“It’s a serious problem for
these students because if they are

are considered illegal aliens,”
Morrison explained. He
stressed, however, that officials

component of skill with a compo-
nent of interest. The second step in
the search he called “Job Catego-
ries.” This step involves discovering
all the names and areas of potential
employers.

The third step is finding out what
will interest employers. Jackson said
that this step is necessary because
the employer has no interest in “you
as a person,” he is interested in what
you can offer him or his business.

The next step in the sequence is
the listing of all the abilities you can
offer in comparison to what the
employer demands. The final step is
to communicate directly to the per-
son who does the hiring. Jackson
said that many people make the mis-
take of inquiring at the personnel
department for jobs.

There is one universal hiring rule
by which employers abide, Jackson
said.

Pitt Concerned About Drinking-

By COLETTE FERRIS

According tola recent study pub-
lished in The Chronicle of Higher
Education, alcohol abuse among
college students is not on the rise,
but the concern of college adminis-
trators is.

This trend is reﬂected at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh where adminis-
trators are expressing increased
concern over the drinking patterns
of Pitt students.

Director of the Office of Resi-
dence Life (ORL) JoAnn Woodson
has begun a series of staff workshops
to review existing alcohol policies.

“Since alcohol is prevalent in
today’s society, our goal is to possi-
bly establish a long-range program
is necessary,” Woodson said. “The
workshop atmosphere enables the
staff members to discuss any litera-
ture which may lead to a greater
understanding of the effects of alco-
hol in relation to the learning
process.” ‘

Woodson added that “the amount
of alcohol consumed appears to be
_up, but not as many students are
drinking. In the residence halls we
see a greater individual consump-
tion, but there are no facts to accu-
rately say it is on the rise.”

Since-alcohol is not illegal in the
state of Pennsylvania for those aged‘
21, all that we can do at Pitt is to
improve the students’ alcohol
awareness, said director of student
activities Andy Smith. I

“From personal observations, as
well as the studies which are being
done, I feel that the alcohol aware-
ness level, not only at Pitt but on
college campuses all over the coun-
try, is at an all-time high,” Smith
said. “Our goal is to insure that we
do as much as is humanly possible to
combat problems which effect edu-
cation; that is what we are here for."

Frank Carter of the Student
Health Center sees concern for alco-
hol consumption extending beyond
university campuses to the national
level. '

“Pennsylvania is especially crack-
ing down on alcohol with the imple-
mentation of the new drunk-
en-driving laws,” Carter
“Society is not so readily accepting
alcohol; it is saying, ‘we’re not toler-
agting this any longer,’ ” he said.

finding a job is communication,
according to Jackson. Too often
people confuse communication with
discussion, he said. “Most people
don’t have a clue as to what com-
munication really is.

“Real communication 'is being
F€5P0n5lb13 to ensure that a message
is received and re-created,” he said.

In an interview situation, Jackson
said, “Make it sound like hiring you
is beneficial to them.”

One way to help get that interview
is the perfect resume, he said. Jack-
son listed some rules to follow in
writing the perfect resume. Selecting
a format, either chronological or
functional, is the first step. A chron-
ological format is a listing of all the
jobs previously held. A functional
format is one which lists all your
special qualifications. But at the
same time, Jackson told the
audience not to rely on the resume
for an intervie/w.

5,030 students from 93 institutions
and found that 79.4 percent of the
students surveyed drink alcoholic
beverages, with 17.2 percent identi-
fying themselves asheavy drinkers.

The study compared its findings
with a similar study conducted in
1974 in which 79.4 percent of those
surveyed said that they drank, with
11.6 percent identifying themselves
as heavy drinkers.

In addition, the study indicated
that: .

Q The lower a student’s grade
point average, the more likely he is
to be a heavy drinker; I

0 Students who are religious are

less likely to drink or to drink heav- »

ily than those who are not; ,
0 Fewer blacks than whites drink;
0 Fewer women than men drink;
I There is virtually no difference
in drinking patterns amongs stu-
dents at large and smallinstitutions;
0 The smaller the community in
which a college is located, the heav-
icr the drinking. At colleges in com-
munities of 100,000 or less, 23.5
percent of students reported /that

they were heavy drinkers, compared

with only 13.1 percent in communi-
ties of over 500,000. '

By JUDY GREER

Students not completing their
course work during the semester
have the option of attaining an
incomplete (G) grade, but perhaps
they should look into other options
available to them.

An incomplete grade is given only
when - students who have been

V attending a course and making regu-

lar progress are prevented—by cir-
cumstances beyond their.
control—from completing the
course after it is too late to with-
draw, according to the College of
Arts and" Sciences Bulletin. '

A G grade must be replaced by a
final grade during the student’s next
Fall or Winter Term in residence (or
in the case of students who are not in
attendance the following term,
within one year); otherwise the privi-
lege of completing it is withdrawn
and the credits are lost.

A \G grade will remain on the
transcript, but will not count in cal-
culating the QPA.

There should‘ be some compact,
clearly-defined package of work to
be done to complete the course as
defnedi by the instructor, who is
under no compulsion to grant a G

grade for substantially incomplete

work. -

I

The student should contact the
teacher at the beginning of the

3 semester within which he is to com-

plete the G grade or simply go ahead
with the already specified work and
hand it in before the last day of
classes, said Irwin Schulman, dean
of CAS.

However, Schulman advised.con-»

tacting the instructor as soon as pos-
sible because there is a lot of faculty
turnover due to teachers’ part-time
status, faculty research goals and-a
large number of graduate teaching
assistants; “there are only some 550
or so permanent faculty members in
the CAS," said Schulman,.

Only the professor who gave the G
grade can change it; and if he
becomes unavailable by leaving the
university, the credits may be lost,
according to the CAS Bulletin.

“It is essentially up to the student
what to do about his incomplete
grade,” said Schulman.

T The total number of students
receiving G grades in the College of
Arts and Scienes for the Fall Term
1982 is 1.7 percent. The highest per-
centage of students receiving G
grades is in the social sciences 100-

199 courses, where 4.5 percent or V

118 students, received G grades.

The humanities 100-l9_9, courses
rank second with 4.4 percent receiv-

ing Ge grades. In East Asian studies,
12.7 percent of the students taking
100-199 level received G grades.
Lower level East Asian courses
handed out the most G grades, 21.3
percent.

The lowest percentage of G
grades, .9 percent, given is in the
natural sciences.

Schulman said that the lower per-
centage in the natural sciences is a
- result of the fact that in those
courses, the course work usually
cannot be made up because ofthe
nature of the work.

. Schulman added that the reason
the upper levelcourses give more G
grades is that term papers can hold
up the student’s completing his
work.

“No one wants to see the students
hurt themselves,” Schulman said.
He added that waiting until the end
of the term to do‘something about
their grades is self-destructive.

Students should become aware of
the options available to them, for
instance, the Credit/No Entry
grade, which minimizes the risk of
losing the credits. Also, students
should use the Add/ Drop period to
shop around, making assessments of
their credit load and checking the
management of their courses and
other burdens on their time.

Just when you think you’ve
heard of every student group in
the country, a new one comes
along. ‘

This time it’s the Student
Action Corps for Animals, head-

Students-Care About AnimalFlights

quartered in Washington, D.C.
The group of students who
belong to this group are alarmed
by the number of farm animals
killed daily “for the whimsical
gratification of our palate.”

- The group is also concerned
with the number of humans that
are killed by diseases linked to
the consumption of animal food.

Oh well, at least students are
getting involved in something.

the Fall term were G’s. He said this is
not a large number, and most of
them were completed, citing an aver-

When the students evaluated the

that counselling had a positive

mance, and 39.5 percent said it had a

can make a one-year deposit on
their tuition. Pitt does not follow
such a policy. .

The problem this year, accord-
ing to Rhea Boudaoud, foreign
student advisor, is centered on

' the Central 'Bank of ‘Nigeria

which has delayed in approving
the funds for the student’s tuition
due to economic problems in

that country.

“The problem is not only regis-
tering, but finding a place to live

and money for food,” Boudaoud
said. “We have landlords and
hospitals calling here asking for
their money and we try to
explain the students’circumstan-
ces to them.”

“We have been in constant
contact with the Embassy and
have been writing letters and
sending students there to speak
with officials, but they don’t
seem to honor our calls,” Chieke
said. “The money has been

delayed, but we don’t _know

why.”

“The system of people repres-
enting us in the Embassy are
incompetent,” Chieke said.
“They do not give us satisfactory
answers.”

Chieke said that two students

were thrown out of their apart-
ments last semester so he took
them into his apartment. Local
churches have also been helpful,

but, he said that he doesn’t know
how long that help will continue.

The Nigerian Student Union
discusses this problem at many
of their meetings, according to
Chieke. “Students are dependent
on their governments for money
and when students have money
problems like these, they think
about them all the time-
sometimes —to the detriment of
their grades.

“Thehuniversity is in constant

touch with the Embassy and with
education attaches," Morrison
said.

He added that actions have to T
M be taken by the Nigerian govern-

ment. Pitt cannot pay tuition for
only one group of students.

The problem is one that has
been witnessed before in the
cases of Ethiopia, Iran and

By PATTI VISHNESKY

Medical students attending Pitt's
School of Medicine have undergone
some drastic changes in tuition rates

_during the last 10 years. Tuition

,

i

rates have increased approximately
45 percent within the last six years.
In addition, 90 percent of the stu-
dents are now receiving some type of
financial aid, as compa-red to the 60
percent of 10 years ago.

Statistics indicate that the tuition
will continue to climb as more and
more students seek ﬁnancial assist-
ance. It soon may be that medical
schools may become exclusive insti-

' tutions for the cOuntry’s rich upper

CI'L1St.

According to Dr. Francis Drew,
dean of student affairs of the School
of Medicine, “Pitt is not out of line
with other medical schools.” Tuition
in some states is lower because of the
state support the schools receive, he
said. Part of the problem of rising
tuition, Drew said, is that Pennsyl-

‘ Vania ranks 45th out ofthe 50 states

that receive educational support.

At the present, tuition at the medi-.

_ cal school for a first year, in-state

student is set at $9,664. Tuition

An incoming married studentwill
pay the same tuition, but living
expenses increase this to $12,000 for

Very few types Of financial aid are
available for students, said Silvia
Plummer of the Office of Student
Affairs. “The only scholarships a
student can receive are those he can
find outside of the school, such as
those that pertain tohis personal
qualifications,” she said. “Grants
such as PHEAA, BEOG and FFIC

are only available to under-
graduates.”
According to _Plummer, the

unavailability of such financial aid
has not affected enrollment yet, but
as for the future they dOn’t know.

I The medical school has converted ’
its scholarships into loans because of
theldwindling amount of financial
aid. The reason behind this conver-
sion _is that when a school give scho-
larships, the money is never seen
again, said Drew. But converting the
scholarships to loans provides the

Drew said that the school received
an increase in funding last year, but
it was not enough to meet the stu-

There are appro_ximately four of
the 135 senior medical students who
receive no aid», but Drew said he

Recently, however, Drew was
informed that the Reagan budget is

Loans available to the medical

Long, Hot
Summer  

The Reagan Administration has promised
to do many things for this country and has
failed to keep its word on most. As one politi-
cian put it, if an individual had backed out of
as many promises, he would have been tried
for fraud.

Now Reagan has presented his budget for
1984 and expressed optimism that the spend-
ing cuts heproposes will pave the way to
recovery. Perhaps Americans expected Rea-
gan to call for more cuts, still this latest
budget plan is quite a surprise.

The president wants to reduce federal
spending for education, job training and
employment programs and services for the
poor while increasing defense expenditures.
As the phrase “long, hot summer” — reminis-
cent of late ’60s riots — creeps back into our
everyday speech, it becomes more reasonable
to suggest that domestic troubles arising

That Old Reagan Magicstrikes Again

By roM WANKO

While watching President, Rea-
gan’s State of the Union Address last
Tuesday, Jan. 25, it _ was obvious
that, although the economy at home
and abroad is in a period of crisis,
and international tensions are sorely
aggravated, that “old Reagan
magic” is still as strong as ever. Not
since those days of “King Richard”
have we had a president as skilled at
deception, astute in misrepresenta-
tion, and with a penchant for dis-

By MARK A. SINDLER

. The man is now a legend. He will
be talked about with the same rever-
ence and stature accorded the likes
of - Ara Parseghian and Amos
Alonzo Stagg. People will erect a
statue in his memory, perhaps just
for the sake of immortalizing that
houndstooth hat that became a Bear
Bryant legacy.

Indeed, Paul William Bryant has
physically left us, but the spirit of his

ways will endure. His death came

after he had ended an extraordinary,
38-year career in college football; He
died almost exactly one month after
his Crimson Tide won handily over
Illinois in the Liberty Bowl.

To quote directly, as he once bel-
lowed, “Quit coaching? I'd croak in
a week.” He was off by three weeks.

It was as if he controlled his own

fate. It has all the makings of Bry-
ant’s being made some superhuman
being. He was, no doubt, if one
stands byithe phenomenal record he
built. Those 323 wins. More than
any other college coach. Probably
an achievement never to be
surpassed.‘

But does that career afford him
the stauts of some greater being—a
being automatically better than you
and I? Should we now kneel in front
of that statue? Will the banks and
post offices close someday for a
national holiday in remembrance of
Bear Bryant?

Yes, on Jan. 26, the day he died,
people from Portland, Oregon, to
Portland, Maine wept; they
mourned as if a close one died and
broke down in disbelieving remorse
upon hearing that the Bear had gone
into permanent hibernation.

Acknowledging these millions of
mourners is easy. It's understanding

them that escapes me. Obviously, he.

was the kind of man whom college
football sees about as often as Hal-
ley’s comet. He somehow mastered
that art of producing the wins on the
gridiron.

Realistically, however, he was not
the one who actually manufactured
the‘victories,. He was only part of
those teams that attained the 300-
plus wins for him. They did it for
him. And, the Bear was fortunate

enough to work for four respected

universities—Maryland, Kentucky,
Texas A&M and finally, Alabama.

These are coaching stints of
unprecedented measure. I If you
spend enough time at something you
like, you will eventually become
pretty proficient at it. Bryant’s trade
was coaching football and making
winners out of the teams he coached.
So, he hit it big. He was fortunate
enough to be retained by several uni-
versities and was empowered with
some mystical magic that permitted
hme the success he enjoyed.

But what to make of his retire-
ment, following the close ofthe 1982
season? The Crimson Tide posted a
7-4 record for the year, considered
by many not to be up to Bryant’s
standards. Who would have heard
of it, the critics probably uttered-
four losses in one year‘.L‘

torting the facts as Pres. Reagan,
“the great communicator.”

I realize a president uses the State
of the Union "Address to definethe
administration’s concepts of reality
to the nation, but from what I heard
the other night, it would appear as if
Reagan and his administration are
living in the Twilight Zone. They are
willing to say whatever is necessary
to convince people that “alight is at
the end of the tunnel.” Whether it be
the domestic economyfarms spend-
ing or international relations, their
line is, “America is on the mend.”

Then it got to Bryant. He couldn’t
handle seeing his-squad go through
the year losing four games. He told
the press that it was time he stepped
down because his kids deserved a
winning coach. The pens were writ-
ing at the speed of light as “the
chosen man” spoke.

Buffoonery! Sure, every collegiate
athlete deserves a coach who strives
for perfection and the maximum
tally "under the “W” column. Not all
coaches reach‘ that plateau consis-
tently enough, though. Ironically,
Bryant camped out on that plateau

 

too long—too long to know what
losing felt like anymore.

So he took the easy way out. He
figured that his age (69) would make
a good backup excuse for his leaving
the football field permanently. But
the real reason was given by Bryant
himself at his final press
conference—the kids deserved a
winning coach.

You see, if Bryant were really as
immortal as everyone in this land
thought he was, then he would've
proven it by filing the 1982 season in
the round file and christening a new
slate for 1983. However, losing foot-

Are educational standards on the
mend? Reagan said, “we need to
begin renewing our educational sys-

when he outlined his four “major"
educational goals, he showed us
once again that “old Reagan magic”
we know so well.

Take’ his first goal, “a quality edu-
cation initiative to encourage a sub-
stantial upgrading of math and
science through block grants to the
states.” This is pure and unadulter-

ated bunk! The block grant program

Bryant—he co_uld not handle it.

He was an idoblwrinany would say.
He was just like any other sports

the dynasty that it was. The analo-
gies could go on. Paul William Bry-
ant was an idol and should be
accorded that due recognition, just
as anyone else in the world of sports
should when accomplishing mighty
feats. ,

But the claim that Bryant was a
superhuman is not true. He was no
better than any of his colleagues,

eral government on its responsibi-
lites to quality education. The block
grant program simply allocates edu-
cational grant money from 35 pro-
grams in one large block sum to each
state. What this does is eliminate the
qualifications individual programs
had to meet on how the money was
to be spent. One effect has been a
significant decrease in federal
money for desegregation.

Reagan’s second stated goal is the
“establishment. of educational sav-
ings accounts that will give middle
and lower income families an incen-
tive to save for their children's edu-
cation.” How will this help families
to save for college if they have little
or no real disposable income? It
won’t help families like the 33 mil-
lion Americans who currently live
below the poverty level, which is
now defined as a family offour mak-
ing less than $6,600 a‘ year. Add to
this middle income families with
mortgages and credit troubles, 14
million unemployed workers and
the continually rising costs of col-
lege, and I think you’ll see Reagan's
educational accounts proposal is
merely a smoke screen to give the
impression that he “really cares
about the little guy.”

Reagan’s third proposal is the
infamous “tuition tax credit pro-.
gram for parents who want to send
their children to private or reli-
giously affiliated schools.” On the
surface this might sound good, but
it’s really a sleeper to give wealthy
people more tax breaks to send their
kids to $10,000-a-year private
schools and to support “religiously
affiliated” schools like Bob Jones
University. Someof the “religiously

affiliated" schools that Reag_an has
in mind are currently denied tuition
tax credits because they discriminate
against minorities, such as Bob
Jones U., the fundamentalist school
that preaches white supremecy and
whose curriculum teaches a “pure”
race ideology.

Reagan's fourth goalis to intro-

duce a constitutional amendment
that will bring back school prayer.
This only magnifies Reagan's deter-
mination and willingness to turn the
clock back on social progress.
Now if we add previous adminis-
tration’ educational measures such
as cuts in student aid programs like
BEOG and Work-Study, cuts of 22
percent in the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program with a 5 percent orig-
ination fee tacked on and the recent
Solomon Amendment, which
requires all male students to register
for the draft or face the loss of all
student aid, loans and scholarships,
the Reagan educational initiative
takes on a different complexion than
what he would have us believe. But
as I said before, that “old Reagan
magic” is still conjuring up a fairy-'
tale view of things in hopes of con-

‘vincing people that he is out there

fighting the good ﬁght for us all.
In a way, that “old Reagan magic”
reminds me of the story about the
travelling salesman and the farmer’s
daughter. Now we all know that the

salesman ends up in bed with the .

farmer's daughter. But if the farmer
would have been smart, he would
have never trusted the good inten-
tions of some fast-talking salesman.
And I think the other night we got a

fast sales pitch from one of thefast-‘ ,

est talking salesmen of them all.

- «As far as many foreign students
are concered, there is an aura of
ignorance about them surrounding
most American-born students.
. Although students from other coun-
tries are seen around campus and
actively participate in Pitt life, most

“ American students don’t know who

‘they are or from where they come.

These 1,700 foreign-bom stu-
dents make up a small (2 or 3 per-
cent of_ the student population) but
not always silent minority at Pitt.

- There are 31 nationality clubs at
the university, 20 of which are rec-
ognized "by the Office of Interna-
tional Services (OIS).. '

While the academic departments. .

individually admit foreign students,
OIS supervises and advises those
students who enter the United
States from other nations.

According to Ralph Morrison,
director of OlS_, Pitt receives 75 to
80 letters and phone calls a day from
students of other countries who are

' interested «in attending Pitt.

Thanks to this interest, the uni-
versity does not need to recruit stu-
dents from foreign nations.

“Pitt has an excellent interna-
tional reputation,” Morrison said.
' “We don’t ‘really need to recruit to
the extent that we send recruiters
anywhere. Because of our reputa-
tion internationally, we haven’t
found it necessary to ‘recruit.’ ”

The number of foreign students at

Pitt has more than doubled in the '

past six years, and about four-fifths
of these students are enrolled in
courses at’ the graduate level,
according to Morrison.

Tuition for a foreign student is
twice the in-state tuition, and most
‘are not eligible for student aid from
the American government.

“You. can't become aresident of
the state no matter how long you've

- .4 been here if you are a foreign stu-

dent,”‘Morrison said.

V Over 60 percent of the foreign
students are financed by the govern-
ments of their countries or by out-
side institutions, he said..Those who

,,\

      
 

According to Morrison, all of the
foreign .students at the university
come on foreign-student visas,
stamps inside of their passports indi-
cating a specific reason for coming
to the United States: in this case, to
study.

 

Despite what some people
think, this is not the typical
Arab student.

“Most of the foreign students go
home,” he said. “They come for the
purpose of study, then they leave.
Foreign students come to the Uni-
ted States because they know they
can get a good education. The U.S.
has been labelled the Graduate
School of the World.”

There are about 330,000 foreign
graduate students studying in the
United States and Pennsylvania is
one of the top 10 states in numbers
of foreign graduate students. Pitt
has the same number of students
from other nations as Penn State
and the University of Pennsylvania.

Before they are admitted to the
university, all foreign students must
take a test of English as a foreign
language. They are tested again
when they get here and if they need
additional help, they are required to
take courses in English as a second
language.» .

“Some come here only to study
English in our language institute,”
Morrison said. ' - '

sion, even if he is from an Eastern
bloc nation.

“If a‘Soviet student applied here

. and was accepted,” Morrisonsaid,

“we would write a visa. If the student
could get out of the country, we
would welcome him here.”

He pointed out that there are 100
students from the People’s Republic
of China studying at Pitt now.

The possibility of finding that a
student is really an agent for a Com-
munist nation is not of much con-
cern to Morrison. The OIS watches
which students come into, the
university.

“We know who’s here because
we write every-visa and have a com-

puterized list of every foreign stu-_

dent,” he said. “This office controls
the foreign visitors who come into
Pitt. No one can come in without us
knowing about it.”

Morrison has found that there are
more problems between students
from variouscountries than there
are between foreign and American
students. . .

.“When there are countriesthat
are fighting and we have students
from those countries here, there are
problems,” he said.

part of the population at Pitt, Ira-

its  

nians make up the highest percen-
tage of foreign students in U.S.
colleges.

Since Ayatollah Khomeini came
into control of Iran, however, the
number of Iranians at Pitt, as well as
at other colleges, has dropped
drastically.

The university has several ways in
which it tries to integrate foreign stu-

' dents with Americans and other for-

eigners. For example, the
International Unit in Bruce Hall
houses 60 undergraduates, half for-

- eign and.half American.

There are also attempts made by
the Pitt International
Organization (PISO) to integrate

foreign students and orient them to >

American life.

Last year, for example, PISO
sponsored an international festival,
and they are in the process of plan-
ning a party for foreign students.
PISO also gives legal help, for exam-
ple, in cases of immigration techni-
calities, to students from other
countries. ‘

Last week, PISO sponsored a lec-
ture_by Professor Richard Cottam
on the consequences of the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon.

PISO would like to plan more
activities but is limited by its budget.

“It’s all a matter of funding if we
can do anything,” said Gina
Pachuta, vice-president of PISO.

Pachuta said that foreign stu-
dents are aware of a stigma attached
to them, and PISO tries to get these
students to interact among them-
selves and with American college
students. '

A lot of pressure is put on Arab
students in particular she said,
because they come from such‘ a dif-
ferent culture, there IS a lot of hostil-
ity towards them.

, “A lot of foreign students don’t
seperate themselves to try to get
into the main stream of American
college life,” Pachuta said. “It’s
nobody’s fault; that’s just the way it
is.’’ i ‘

The mini-festival that PISO is
planning (no date is set at this time)
will be “a sort of party with a band
and disc jockey and food and stuff.”

Pachuta attributes some of the
segregation of foreign students to

the fact that a lot of the foreign stu— ‘

dents simply _have no idea how ‘to
meet the Americans outside of
class. ‘ "

“It’s hard to get in the main-
stream,” she said. .

To help orient students from for-
eign nations with the United States

- ingeneral and Pittsburgh in particu-

lar, the Pittsburgh Council for Inter-
national Visitors (PCIV) provides
special services for students in all of
the colleges in the-area, including
Pitt, Duquesne, Point Park and

- Robert Morris college.

PCIV was formed about 20 years
ago “when there was a real recogni-,
tion that there were many, many
foreign students coming to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh,” said Barbara
S. Platt, program coordinator.

“sThere was an awareness that
there wasn’t any organizaiton that
focused on putting them in touch
with the American culture, the
American way of life,” Platt said.

The council wanted to provide
foreign’ students with services in
addition to those of the admissions,
financial aid and housing offices.

Its programs are open to all for.-
eign students who are temporarily
studying in the United States.

“What we want is to have them
"understand our life better so that
when they go back to their coun-

' tries, they can help make things very

clear,” Platt said.

Until people come to the United
States, she said, their only percep-

tions of America usually come from,

movies, which do not provide an
accurate picture.

PCIV tries to put foreigners in
contact with a variety of people-
not just professors and administra-
tors. They have a network of about

1,400 families who volunteer to’

invite foreign students into their
homes.

Most "of the time, this is for a
dinner and an evening of talking.
“Often these evenings turn into last-
ing friendships,” Platt said, adding
that sometimes they become “very
close friendships.”

Students can get an application
‘before they come to the United
States for a pre-registration home
stay with a host family fora couple
days.

“That particular program very-

often makes the total difference of
how (foreign students) feel, how
they adjust,” Platt said.

“If they’re taken into somebody’s
home, that gives them a‘ much more
secure feeling about starting out.”

PCIV also has a community visit
program where they arrange a ser-
ies of tours for students from out_-
side the country so they can visit
banks, the courts, a post office, bak-
ing companies and sights outside of
the city as well.

Platt said that students from
other countries often experience a
sense of loneliness; it is hard to meet
people from their home countries
and often just as difficult to meet
Americans and adjust to the Ameri-
can way of life. '

The programs offered by Pitt and
the Pittsburgh Council for Interna-
tional Visitors, as well as broader
minds on the part of American stu-
dents, will-combat that loneliness.

The Problems with Being I
a Foreign Student

Foreign students coming to
the United States for the first
time encounter many of the
same problems that American
students face. '

“The extremely high cost of
rent and the higher costs of tui-
tion are the two main problems I
face,” Michael Adole, a Nigerian
student studying public and
international affairs, said.

Adole came to the university
because he wanted a broader
background in his field of study
than he could have received in
his native country. He plans to
return to Nigeria after he com-
pletes two more years in the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs.

“I was lucky enough to have a

' friend set up a place for me to

live. He looked for a place for me
and arranged everything,” Adole
said. _

He said that the university has
an orientation program set up
for incoming foreign students.
The program includes formal

' discussions, meetings with the”

staff of the Office of International
Services (OIS), picnics and bus

rides to different parts of the city. _

“They help the foreign stu-
dents to socialize and become
integrated into the university
system. They were very helpful
and made us feel welcome,”
Adole commented. 7

Adole came to the United
States after meeting several uni-
versity professors, first in Nige-
ria and later in Washington, D.C.
He knew some aspects of the
program in African political
administration and believed that
the program was right for him.

“The initial arrangements of
the university were very helpful.
They familiarized us with the
environment and welcomed us
with a reception,” Adole said.

Another foreign" student,
Chunling Lin, from Taiwan, also
commented about the high tui-
tion costs students from other
countries must pay. Her tuition
is approximately $2600 for the
masters program in computer
science. ,

“I came to the university
because my sister is also study-

ing here and my sister’s husband .

attends C.M.U. I did not go
through an orientation process;
my sister showed me around the
city,” Lin said. _

She also plans to return home
but likes America and says she
can do more things here than
she can do in her native
homeland.

“A problem I do face is that

' some of my teachers speak too

quickly, and Icannot understand
them,” Lin said.

She worked part-time at Hill-
man Library but after a while felt
she was being left out of things
and later quit her job‘.

“I felt alienated working in the
library. I worked very, very hard
and‘saw American students just.
sitting around,'and I never got
any feedback. It just seemed dis-
honest for someone to sit
around and "get paid for it,” Lin
said. i » , .

Overall, Lin-didn't have many

university because she had the
added security of her sister’s
already attending Pitt. ,
Patty Chou, another student
from Taiwan, came to the uni-
versity because her husband is a
computer science professor
here. She is also studying for her
masters degree in computer
science.
“I would like to return to Tai-
' wan to work in private industry
or in a school assisting young
children,” Chou said.

‘I don’t have any prob-

lems with school costs,

but it is a complaint of

‘other foreign students.

My problems occurred

two years ago during the

disagreements between

the US. and Iran.’

Her biggest problem is under-
standing American slang. She
said that when professors use _

‘ slang terms, she becomes
confused.

One of the luckier foreign stu-.
dents, who wishes, to remain
anonymous, is from Iran. He
doesn’t find tuition costs a prob-
lem because he received a teach-
ing fellowship his first year and is
currently receiving a Mellon
fellowship.

“I don’t have any problems
with school costs, but it is a com-
plaint of other foreign students.
My problems occurred two
years ago during the disagree-
ments between the U.S. ‘ and
Iran. That was the only time Ihad
any problems, and they weren’t
with the university,” he said.

Those problems stemmed
from, the Federal Immigration
Agency. The Iranian students at
Pitt were interviewed ‘ by the
agency.” He said there were no
repercussions from students’
and professors helped him,dur-
ing that time by writing recom-
mendation letters for him. _

‘‘I’m here to get my Ph.D, in
music, and overall, I haven’t had

any major problems at the uni- —i

versity,” he said.
Foreign students ‘at Pitt are -

offered an orientation program .

when they arrive. on campus
which helps to integrate them to ‘
the college system. ._ .

They have complaints about
high rent, high tuition costs and '

I language. ba_rriers—things that. _‘

A FEW NOTES ON THE FOUNDER OF “NEGRO HISTORY WEEK/BLACK HISTORY MONTH”

/p In spite of the historical negation of _Afro-American history, DR. CARTER G. WOODSON, a pioneer in
the field, ﬁrmly believed that Afro-Americans had a history worthy of research, publication and study.
Central to his belief was the idea that through the study of Afro-American History, change in the attitude of
Blacks toward thamselves and the attitude of whites toward Blacks could be realized. Sharing the
progressive faith in “scientific investigation and education as twin pillars of progress.” Dr. Woodson set out
to promote the history and culture of Africa and her decendants and the Negro History Week Celebration
was one of several instruments he developed to facilitate this educative process. Negro History Week was
first observed in February 1926.

It is the sincere hope of the Black Action society that the above programs will serve to enlighten our
constituency and continue on the tradition that was founded by DR. C.G. WOODSON. I

. continued from page one
able to tie the game at the 5:08 mark
 _of the first half, and shortly after,
ii-(‘Pitt took a five-point lead.

“The key in the game was the first ,

five minutes,” Chipman said. “We
didn’t force the‘shot; instead, we

worked hard to get the good shot.”

St.John’s was able to cut the
Panther lead to one at halftime with

, the outside shooting of forward
Chris Mullen. The 6-6 sophomore,
who led the Redmenwith 20 points,

hit a layup and two longjumpers in '

the last two minutes, making the
score 32-31.

,-Mullin continued his torrid dut-
side shooting in the second half, and
along withthe inside play of reserve

,’ , , center Bill Wennington—who made
. =?’all'five shots in the second half——
gave the.Redmen a 55-52 lead.

But after a George Allen jumper,
Pitt guard Billy Culbertson st_ole the
ball_ at midcourt and went in for a

layup, giving the Panthers a 56-55 a

l_ead.~ _ _

,-The game pivoted on the matter of
which team would make the major
mistake. A travelling call on Allen
and a layup by Wennington gave St.
John’s a brief 63-62 lead. Later,
when Pitt had a three-point lead,

Johnson wascalled for travelling,

and a Billy Goodwin jumper cut the
lead to 68-67.’ ' » .

But the Redmen made the fatal

 __ istake. With’ the opportunity to

"take the lead’ after an one-and-one

miss by Culbertson, the 1-3-1 zone

press forced ‘an errant pass off
Good,win’s hands.

The 6-1 junior point guard made
"the foul shots in the final half-
minute, sealing the victory for the
‘Panthers. 3

»- The extra attention given to Mul— '

lin, who didn’t have a point inthe
last 10 minutes, helped Pitt;

“We concentrated on stopping
Mullin,” Culbertson said. “We
didn’t want him to take good shots.”

guard Joey David said. “We

7.‘; ,_couldn’t afford to have him take the
lllfiﬁpen shot.” ’

“We had three guys who canscore

on this team,” St. John’s head coach

' Lou Carnesecca said. “The other
guys were open.”

It was a game Pitt needed to earn
league, if not national, respect.

“We are not going to be,the patsy
of the league," Culbertson said.

“Billy said it best when he said the
team wastired of coming close——we
wanted to win a game,” Chipman
said. “We finally did. Now we feel we
belong in the Big East.

“Wefinal1y opened eyes in the Big
East," Vaughan said. _“We went out
there and beat St.John’s.”

Last night’s win was much more

than an upset over the best team in‘

Qghe league and one of the best in the

P nation. It establishes the Panthers as

a legitimate team in the Big East
conference.

‘By TODD ERKEL

_The Pitt Pantners discovered last‘-
night that they do indeed belong in
the Big East, while the sellout crowd
inattendance at the Fitzgerald Field . J
House found out what fans in Lex-

ington, Ky., and Bloomin\gton, Ind.,
have long known as a way of life—'.
the thrill of college basketball. 
Pitt’s upset victory over St. John's

takes on even more significance con- I
sidering how it was accomplished.

Pitt, forvone of the few times this"

‘ season, took control early and hung I
on after falling behind in the second

half. '  ‘
“I thought the key was the five or. —
‘~ six minutes-_.where we fell behind,"

 — P_itt...coac_li Roy Chipman said. “In

other ga_rne‘s,'we forced shots‘ and _
tried to get, back im'mediately...to-_;._
, night we played; with poise.” I 
 “I just decided to calm down,” >
 Williams said. ,“Tonight I didn’t 
. think." as much about what I had to
-“=do..” ’  I
' ' Junior ‘Billy Culbertson con- _,
' tinued “to ' prove himself a team‘
leader, contributing seven assists.-. '
while committing only one turnover.
He expected Williams to have a
great night. _
_ “I was on Andre so hard today
that if he had played badly tonight,
he would have had me to deal with,”-
Culbertson grinned. “Without his
play, my free throws wouldn’t have i
meant a thing.” .

The play of Williams came as no
surprise to Chipman, either.“He was '
playing the other parts of his game
well, and tonight ‘he added (another)
part—the scoring."

The crowd of 6,l‘80—the Panth-
er‘s third sellout of the season-
called upon an old friend in Tiger
Paul Auslander, and the spunky
man with the drooping trousers led
his followers on to chants of “let’s go
Pitt! let’s go Pitt!” ' -'

“It happened on impulse,” Aus-
landersaid of his return to the ﬂoor.
“It’s no big deal.” 5

Chipman and some of Pitt's play-
ers~knew that it was quite a big
deal———probably the difference in the
score. '

“Thecrowd tonight was a Big East
crowd,” Chipman said. “It had to be
worth eight or nine points. I’d like to
‘take them to U. Conn. with us on _,
Saturday.”

Junior Clyde Vaughan continued
to dominate some of the Big East’s
hes}, pumping in 24 hard—fought
points, and once again led the team
with six rebounds.

But that sort of play is expected.
from Vaughan, the Big East’s lead-
ing scorer. For Williams, who has’
struggled for much of the season, A
this game will bring some much-
needed confidence. A

“The Williams kid was superb,"
said. “He was hitting the shots we

Kingdom Finds Success In Track

By CHARLIE O'HARA

I _Many people thought Panther
halfback-hurdler Roger Kingdom
would give up football to concen-
trate on track, but instead, he
decided to concentrate on both
sports.

“I have no intention of quitting
football,” Kingdom said. “I still feel

that someday I could become a pro.”

—--TJ1ere’s no questioning his talent
on the track. Earlier this season,

The Pitt News, Wednesday Februaiy 2. 1933‘

Kingdom broke the Panther record
in the 55—meter hurdles while quali-
fying for nationals. Last weekend,
the sophomore broke the record in
the 60-meter hurdles with a time of
7.77, finishing a tenth of a second
behind Willie Gault.

Assistant coach Steve Lewis
believes better things are yet to come
for Kingdom.

“Roger has the potential to
become a great hurdler,” Lewis said
There is no question that he has the

“He is, right now, one of the top
l0 hurdlers in the country. The only
thing he may be lacking would be
experience on a national-class
level."

The native of Unadilla, Ga., was
an all-around track performer in
high school. Kingdom held state
records in the high jump and 110-
yard hurdles. He also threw the dis-
cus 164 feet.

Kingdom was named Middle
Georgia Track Athlete of the Year.
He was also awarded the “Bruce
Yohe Award” by the Atlanta Track
Club. He also won “Athlete of the
Year” from the same club, beating
out Georgia running back Herschel
Walker. r

Kingdom has shown versatility in
collegiate track, competing in the
55- and 60-meter hurdles, the 200-
meter run and the high jump. He is

also a member of the shuttle hurdle I

relay, the 400- and the 800-meter
relay teams. ‘
This versatility benefits the team.

not only his relay team’s success, but
also the overall team’s success,”

Sees Bright Year

Kingdom may also have a chance
to start for the Panther football
team next year. With the move of
starting safety Tom Flynn to quar-
terback and the graduation of
backup defensive back Rick Duko-
vich, Kingdom may finally show his
talents on the football field.

“This coming season looks espe-
cially bright,” Kingdom said. “The

free safety position is almost wide. '
_ open. I plan on being right in the

running for the spot.”

Kingdom believes he is fortunate
to participate in both the football
and track programs.

“I see myself as a part of a winning
tradition,” he said. “I didn’t have
that luxury in high school, and it is
very important to me.

“In football, I have been able to
travel and deal with first-class peo-
ple. The track experience has
enabled me to run against some of
the finest athletes in the world.”

.   I News, ‘ Wedriesday February .2, 

By SCOTT DELLETT _

, A switch in the lineup and the
emergence of a high-touted fresh-
man class were the keys in the Lady
Panther swim team’s first victory of
the dual meet season, a 98-50 rout of
West Virginia Saturday at Trees
Pool.

’ - ‘ “Everyone did a good job yester-
ritzy,” coach David Belowich said.
“We didn't have a bad swim the
whole meet.”

Consistent swimming was a good
sign for the team. Pitt had practiced

.well throughout theseason, but _

when the meets came, it was differ-
ent, as was evident by the team’s 0-5
record.

‘‘I have seen the team work out
well every practice—I could see their
progress,” Belowich said.

The first part of Belowich’s strate-
gy appeared in the first event—the
400-yard medley relay—where_ the
Lady Panthers had a freshman
lineup of Georgia Spolsky, Alicia
Dugan, Nordine Burrell and Wendy
Morgan. Even though the relay ﬁn-
ished second, the plot was set.

“This forced West Virginia to put
their best against our best,” Belo-
wich said.

The second part of the strategy

-was to move Sue Heon to the 200-
yard fréestyle instead of the breast
stroke events for the same reasons—
attack the Lady Mountaineers’_best

‘events with l’itt’s best people. ,_

The results were clear. Heon and
Spolsky finished one-two in the 100-
yard freestyle, tying the meet at 8.
The Lady Panthers took the lead for
the rest of the meet as Jan Ujevich
took first in the 100-yard backstroke
and Denise Sedlacek placed second.

Hoen took first in the 200-yard
freestyle with a season best of 1253.3
while Dugan ﬁnished second with a
personal best of 1255.8. In the back-
stroke and breast stroke events,
Wendy Morgan, Diana Firth and
Laura Barber did a respectable job

against the strong points of the Lady“

Mountaineer lineup.

Firth finished first in the 200-yard
breast stroke (2:27.2) and the 200-
yard individual medley (2:15).
Barber took second place in the 100-
yard backstroke and the 200-yard
backstroke. Morgan took second in
the 100-yard breast stroke and third
in the 200-yard breast stroke.

“Wendy wasn't as good at the 200-
yard breast stroke as she was in the
500 or 100,” Belowich said. “In every
meet, she has improved her time in
this event. - '

“Against West Virginia, she swam V

the 200 two seconds faster than
against Clarion and five seconds fas-
ter than against Penn State. That's
phenomenal improvement.”

The divers also had a fine meet,
according to Belowich. Yvonne
Johnston took first place in both the
one- and three-meter diving events.

Freshman Tricia Schutz, despite a
deep bruise suffered when her hand
hit the diving board, took second in

- the three-meter event.

“It was the best I have seen
Yvonne dive,” Belowich said. “She
has been hitting much cleaner
dives.”

“Tricia dove extremely well, con-
sidering her injuries. She has been
rapidly improving.”

So have all the freshmen, which
gives Belowich an advantage he
didn't have at the beginninglof the
season. ' '1

“The freshmen are coming of
age,” he said. “I knew at the begin-
ning of the season it would take time
for this team to gel.”

“Now, other teams have to deal
with two people in an event instead
of one and this is important. I saw a
lot of good things which will set us
up for the future.”

Ahead for the Lady Panthers are a
dual meet Friday against Kent State
and the Big East Championship held
at Trees Pool.

“It is more fun to swim well and
win than it is to lose,” Belowich said.
“Now it’s time to get on with busi-
ness as usual.”

POOL WAVES—Tickets for the
Big East swimming championships,
to be held at Trees Pool, are now on
sale to students. The cost will be two
dollars for all six events during the
