By Jason Hillman
Editor in Chief

Present at the meeting were Harmon,
Director of Student Activities Joe
Cavalla, SGB Advisor Joyce Giangarlo,
Allocations Committee Advisor Terry
Milani, Allocations Chairperson Lisa
Waslo and former Allocations member
Cheston Reisler. °

Brought up during the meeting were
the choice of places for theretreat, the
Allocations committee and the /process
by which the money was spent. '

Reisler showed a guest room agree-

,ment, dated late November early
December, as proofthat reservations
were made before the proposal was

presented to Allocations. ‘
Giangarlo said that the agreement
was nonbinding and that a similar
agreement was made with Embassy
Suites. The actual contract was signed
Dec. 22, after the proposal was sent to
and reviewed by Allocations.
“Nemacolin came up on the basis of
New Student Programs mentioning
what a great deal they had gotten there
and how much more affordable it was
because they had always used Embassy
Suites and that we might want to take a
look at them,” Giangarlo said.

Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs
William Harmon called a meeting to
resolve the final bill for the Student

$367.60 was underwritten by the
Offices of Student Activities, $645 by
the Office of Student Affairs. The total
cost for the SGB board was $8,183.90.

“Did we overspend? Yes and it’ is my
fault,” Harmon said during the meeting.

Pitt Gree/es sappoit Pennsylvania Special Olympics

 

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

Pitt Greeks turned out in full force
on Monday and Tuesday to show sup-
port for their Greek Week charity,
Pennsylvania Special Olympics. The
events were held at the Pittsburgh
Sports Garden and included a Day for
the Athletes and a sports auction
which raised an estimated $50,000 for
the charity.

“The turnout was absolutely fantas-
tic, both for athletes and Pitt Greeks,”
said Chris Shovlin, Western

Development director of Pennsylvania
Special Olympics. “Not to mention the
potential of a million people watching
the sports auction on KBL.”

The sports auction was held on
Tuesday evening and featured items
donated by local and national s-ports
figures. Televised by the KBL cable
network, bids were phoned in by
viewers as the items were displayed
by the athletes of the Special
Olympics and local sports celebrities.

According to events co-Chairperson

members were in charge of answering

“We were grateful for the help of
Pitt students, especially answering
phones,” Shovlin said. “The phones
were jammed all night with people
trying to get through with bids.”

Crouse said the auction brought
high bids of approximately $2,000 for
game jerseys worn by former football
player Joe Namath and baseball player
Nolan Ryan. \*

“It was a huge success,” Crouse said.

Learn to accept and respect yourself

popular book a few
A years back was called
I’m OK, You’re OK,
and its basic message was
that in order to improve the
quality of our lives we all
need to accept ourselves for
who we are and other peo-
ple for who they are. The
message sounds simple, but
it’s not all that easy to learn
to accept and respect our-
selves and then to also
extend that attitude to oth—
ers.

Self respect derives from a
basic belief that one is capa—
ble of living well in the
world and worthy of being
appreciated by others.
Without this belief, life can
be very difficult and unre-
warding.

The good news is that self-
appreciation can be learned.
Cognitive-behavioral thera-
pists teach us that people
with a negative self concept
or life view retain this self-
image by their thought pat-

terns and by the expecta-
tions that they maintain. The
person who constantly puts
himself or herself down or
who consistently anticipates
failure or rejection,
inevitably finds life disap-

problems is
that you think that people
don’t like you, you can
make considerable progress
with this just by changing
the focus from “who likes
me” to “whom do I like.”
When you identify people
around you that you like,
you need to communicate
this liking in direct and indi-

rect ways. This might be
accomplished for example
by greeting the person
warmly, responding with
interest to a story he or she
relates or by encouraging
the person to talk about
himself or herself. More sim-
ply stated, behaving in ways
that you would like people
to behave toward you.

I have never met a person
who does these things well
who is not also well liked.
Becoming better at relating
to others makes us feel bet-
ter about ourselves, and this,
in turn, also makes us more
attractive to other people.

Almost all the problems
we have that make us feel
bad about ourselves are
solvable if taken one at a
time and systematically and
intelligently addressed. If
you can’t do it on your own,
ask a friend, a counselor or
someone else you trust for
help. You are OK, all you
need to do is believe it.

Pitt Program Council sponsors two Spring Break trips

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

The Pitt Program Council is
sponsoring two trips for Spring
Break 1995. Students have the
choice of Cancun, Mexico, or
Panama City Beach, Florida.

The trip to Panama City
Beach will last one week. The
cost of the trip is $239, plus a
$25 refundable damage
deposit. A $50 deposit by
Friday, Feb. 5 guarantees stu-
dents a spot.

Students will head down on
busses equipped with VCRs
and televisions so that movies
can be watched during the trip.

According to Tom Misuraca,

assistant director of student
activities, the students will be
staying at the Holiday Inn,
which is located on the water-
front, according to the Holiday
Inn Beach Resort. The hotel is
also winner of the Holiday Inn
Worldwide New Development
and Quality Excellence Awards.

Misuraca guaranteed at least
one party and said that the
security is very polite with the
students and the management
is very responsive to the needs
of the students while they are
staying at the hotel.

The trip to Cancun will last
seven days and six nights.

Misuraca said that students
will be flown to Cancun and

Engineering students, like
all students, worry about a
job after graduation. To get
the edge over competitors,
helpful information can be
obtained today by Kevin
Collins from the Placement
Center.

The seminar is being
sponsored by the
Engineering Student Council
(ESC) and the Placement
Center. It is being held in
Room 274 in the School of
Engineering, (Benedum)
every Thursday from 1 p.m.
to 3 p.m. Interviewing tips,
letter writing, resume
reviews and job hunting
strategies are just a few
areas that will be addressed
by Collins.

The ESC and the entire
engineering student body

will also begin the search
for a new dean. The present
dean, Dr. Charles A. Sorber,
will be leaving Pitt in April
for a new position at the
University of Texas. He will
be the president at Perian
Basin, a branch campus of
the university.

Jeannette Johnson, presi-
dent of ESC, will be on the
new Dean Search
Committee and she asked
that the students cooperate
by giving her ideas about
concerns they have dealing
with the search and inter-
views of a new dean.

The committee will be
holding separate faculty and
student forums to get their
input and will send adver-
tisements to every college
campus in the nation. Adds

every division.

will stay at Club Las Perlas.
Students will be staying two to
a room. Roommate requests
will only be guaranteed for
those who sign up with two
people to a room.

University Administrator
Donna Lim will be on the trip
to assist students with problems
they may encounter on the trip,
Misuraca said.

Unfortunately, the deadline
for reserving a spot to Cancun
has expired.

Regarding the prices of other
trips being offered on campus,
Misuraca said that students
should really shop around and
be careful about what they
were getting themselves into.

“Students should really watch
for the hidden costs that aren’t
mentioned and end up paying
for later," he said.

Misuraca said that many hid-
den costs are not mentioned,
such  a hotel close to the
beach and costs of additional
roommates. Other instances
have included having to meet
the tour bus in another city in
order to make the trip.

According to Misuraca, the
PPC will offer a good trip to
the students based on the fact
that they have a reputation to
maintain at the university.

“\Ve have to offer a good
trip. These people that come to
campus to recruit for Spring

Break trips just have to change
their phone numbers if some-
thing goes wrong,“ he said.
"We are here year after year.
We were here before, were
here now and well be here in
the future."

Misuraca said that unlike
some agencies that offer trips.
PPC is specifically non—commis-
sion. "Students have to pay
money every year for student
activities, why should they put
more money into our pocket?”

Misuraca said that the PPC is
there to look out for the best
interests of the students. “Were
here to offer the highest quality
travel at the lowest price possi-
ble.”

The Pitt Law School is not just for law stu-
dents, it is for all students — undergraduate
or graduate.

“Many of the programs we put on have sig-
nificant relevance to any academic respect,”
said Chuck Schardong, assistant dean of the
Law School.

The Law School is sponsoring many events
and speakers throughout the semester. All are
expected to be educational for anyone with
some interest in the law and hot topic issues.

The events are anchored by the moot court
competitions. They involve arguing cases for
appeal, as lawyers would do in front of the
Supreme Court. All cases argued are expected
to be timely issues.

On the weekend of Feb. 19 and 20, Pitt will
host the 1993 Mid-Atlantic Regionals of the
Phillip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court
Competition, one of the largest of these moot
competitions.

Many U.S. schools will be invited to com-
pete for a chance to go on to the Moot Court

national competition in Washington, D.C.,
From there, they will compete on an interna-
tional level.

The Appellate Moot Court competitions will
also be held in February. The preliminary
competitions will be held at 6 p.m. on Feb. 2,
9 and 16. On Feb. 25, at noon, Pittlwill hold
the Appelate Moot Court final.

Many students may not have seen a real
courtroom drama, so on Feb. 9 and 10
the Pennsylvania Bureau of Occupational
Affairs will hear two actual license cases. The
hearings will be held from 8:30 a.m. to
3:30 p.m. in the Teplitz Memorial Courtroom.

The first case will be the State Real Estate
Commission vs. Glotfelty. The other case
involves the State Board of Cosmotology vs.
Direnna. Both cases will be interesting for
anyone interested in license law.

Along with the Moot Court Competition and
license cases, the school will welcome many
speakers during the semester.

Coming up on Feb. 8 is the Marion Damick
Memorial Lecture, featuring Professor David
Cole of Georgetown University. The lecture is

Research and teaching both important to Pitt professor

By Bob Wagner
For The Pitt News

In his introduction to biopsychology
class, Dr. Anthony Caggiula, a Pitt psy-
chology professor, has just finished
passing out the sample exams to the
students and has begun talking about
how to approach the exams while
walking around the classroom.

“I guarantee that whatever you do
not know will be on the test,” Caggiula
warns as he starts the day’s lecture.

You see, to Caggiula, a college pro-
fessor cannot live on research alone.
“They are kind of dependent on each
other,” he says. “I can’t imagine doing
one without the other. And, to me,
they’re both important."

To Caggiula, part of his effectiveness

as a teacher is the fact that he does do
research, and that makes him aware of
new developments in psychology. “I’m
also excited about them,” he says.
* “I think my research benefits from
the fact that I have to communicate
results not only to other professionals,
but to students.”

So, it’s a matter of give and take to

Caggiula. Both research and teaching

are important to each other, and nei-
ther one is more important than the
other. He says, “I see them as absolute-

ly essential elements of my career.”

In almost every introductory psychol-
ogy book there are numerous exam-
ples listed about people switching
majors to psychology for different rea-
sons. And Caggiula is one of those
people.

Caggiula began his undergraduate
years at St. _Ioseph’s University (then
called St. Joseph's A College) in
Philadelphia as an honor roll, pre-med
commuter student that took a couple of
a psychology courses. After taking
those. courses, he decided that he
wanted to become a psychologist
instead — much to the displeasure of
many people, like his parents.

However, he did not disappoint his
parents with his newfound interest.
Caggiula and three other undergradu-

ates put together the first psychology
lab at St. Joseph’s in a deserted on-
campus barber shop, where they did
psychology experiments with fish.

“It was an experiment we tried out,”
Caggiula says. “And we became very
interested in psychology and went on
to graduate sch’ool.” 1

Caggiula then went to graduate
school at the University of Delaware
and received a master’s degree in social
psychology. He then went to Princeton
for a doctorate in biological psycholo-
gy. A post—doctoral fellowship at the
University of Michigan followed. And
in 1968, he came back to Pennsylvania
and became an assistant professor at
the University of Pittsburgh.

When he came to Pitt, he was not a
stranger to teaching, since he had
taught awhile at Michigan. “I found
very early that I enjoyed it, that I liked
it, that it wasn’t something you had to
do because it was the nature of the
contract, but that is was fun,” he says.

“I always wanted to continue my
teaching, even now.” He also does
research and is chair of the graduate
training program for biopsychology
majors, among other responsibilities.

Caggiula has seen huge changes here
at Pitt, especially in the composition of
classes. “There was a time when the
only students who took [introduction to
biopsychologyl were either psychology
majors or biology majors,” he says.
However, with the natural science
requirements here at Pitt, many of the
students in Caggiula’s introduction to
biopsychology class are n‘on-science
majors.

That is no problem to Caggiula, who

‘actually looks forward to teaching the

non-science major students. He says it
is actually a challenge to be confronted
by students who are not really interest-
ed in the subject matter. “So I have to
put a little effort into communicating to
them why they should be interested,”
he says.

Teaching something that interests the
students prompted Caggiula to create
the introduction to psychology as a

 

Dr. Anthony Caggiula.

natural science, also commonly .called
psych 15, and psychoneuro'immunolo-
gy, a dynamic new field that is being
heavily researched here at Pitt.

Caggiula and a number of the faculty
in the Psychology Department felt that
the introductory psychology course
presented too much information and
overwhelmed the student. “It was
almost like the tours of Europe, that
each day you were in a different city,”
he says. “We thought a different format
for an introductory course might be
more appropriate to show how the sci-
ence of psychology really applies to
problems and issues that most people
are interested in.” if

The new introductory course uses a
module approach. Each module would
be an interesting psychological prob-
lem, such as what is love -or drug
addiction, and several classes would be
spent on that module. Instead of bor-
ing the student, the student would be

James T. Madl/The Pitt News

more interested. With the old psych 10
introduction to psychology, even stu-
dents aspiring to go into psychology
were disenchanted with the course.

“It was really an attempt to take an
introductory psychology course and

make it more interesting,” he says.‘

“Our initial response from the students
was very favorable,” adding that now
more students take the psych 15 intro-
ductory course than the psych 10
course. -
Caggiula says he also wants to com-
municate to students new fields of
interest in psychology, and he does
that with the psychoneuroimmunology
course; It isone o“f'tl'Ie~'firs't“‘cot1rses“of
its type, taught by several people and
only to advanced undergraduates and
graduate students. This course deals
with psychology relating to disease and
the functioning of the immune system.

cost was for one person, so he
did not think there was anything
wrong with that.

\Y/aslo also questioned the fact
that Giangarlos graduate assis-
tant Kristen Scott, who made the
arrangements, went on the
retreat. The assistants cost was
covered by the Oﬁice of Student
Activities. I-Iannon also spent a
night and covered the cost lrom
the Ollice of Student Affairs.

“I think that. administratively.
to bring someone to a resort to
spark for an horn‘ and to pay for
them and their spouse to stay
overnight and use the facilities
and stay the entire next day is
very unethical.“ \‘€“'aslo said. "I
am very disappointed with the

Giangarlo said the Embassy
Suite retreat would have been
similar in price to the
Nemacolin retreat.

Reisler said he was going to
check with Embassy Suites to
see what a comparable retreat
would have cost.

Reisler also said that the rep-
utation of Allocations is at a
low because students see the
committee as a “rubber stamp“
for the SGB. "llt is] one of the
things that certainly should be
addressed." Reisler said.

“I think the whole process
needs to be re\'iewe.d. not nec-
essarily in terms of the.
Committee.
because I think the Allocations
Committee fulfilled its respon-
sibility ol‘ making a recommen-
dation.“ Harmon said. "Now a

Allocations

recommendation is exactly
that: a recomrnendation.
Wliicli means I can either
accept it or I can reject it. And
there's nothing constitutionally
wrong with that. And I think
that‘s what happened in this
case.“

“But the issue is that you
want lSGBl to behave respon-
sibly when they overrule
lAllocationsl. You need to give
them the opportunity to do
that.

“This board did not have the
opportunity to behave respon-
sibly enough to have the
power to \V'aslo

o\'errule.“

Reisler said he also objects
to most of the Sl.()l2.6()
deducted from the bill because

that money still comes from
the students indirectly.

  ’ Thursday, Febrw 4, 1993

Whether you loved her or hated her, there is no denying that
she was an identifiable figure throughout her years as a politi-
cian. Now that Sophie Masloff has decided to call it quits as
mayor of the city of Pittsburgh, perhaps next she will land a
role as the diminutive, nagging grandmother in Woody Allen’s
next film. Who will ever forget the day after the Penguins won

"their second Stanley Cup when Sophie stood on the podium

and yelled, “Scratch my back with a hacksaw.” It was all
Sophie.

Mayor Masloff had a long career in politics. She was elected
in 1976 to the Pittsburgh City Council. She reigned there until
1985 when she was chosen to finish out the term of Mayor
Richard Caliguire, who died of Amyloidosis. In 1989 she was
elected mayor of Pittsburgh by her own merit, and the rest of
the story is marked both by successes and failures.

Policy experts and economists have given her high marks for
her job handling the economy. She cut the city wage tax twice,
and the economy grew steadily under her administration. She
also pushed hard for greater equality for women and minorities
in city offices. Amidst the successes, their were also blemishes
on her record. She failed as a voice in Harrisburg and did little
in terms of developing the city.

But, like so few politicians, Sophie Masloff will become a
benchmark for her successors. Whereas John F. Kennedy was
instrumental in painting a picture of Camelot, Masloff was the
force behind the ‘burgh. The bright red hair, and raspy voice
made Masloff a political cartoonists dream. Her record is mixed,
but she will be one of those politicians the constituents will
never forget.

Blockbuster policy

Ever since J. Dennis O’Connor was appointed chancellor
of the university he has fought hard to improve the acade-
mic environment at Pitt. Some of his decisions have been
direct: the approval of an undergraduate business school
and the raising of academic standards for incoming athletes
are two that immediately come to mind. Other actions,
such as the implementationof a new campus shuttle sys-
tem and tougher harassment policies, have not been “acad—
emic” decisions but are no doubt just as important. They
make the campus a more accessible place for those wishing
to study. Concerns can now be redirected toward books
and away from “secondary” issues.

In a letter last month O’Connor stated the new harass-
ment policy. It basically asserted that nobody associated
with the university can intentionally engage in an activity
with the purpose of interfering in a person’s work or acad-
emic performance. The policy includes cases based on
race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, age,
marital and familial status, sexual orientation and veteran
status.

The harassment policy is necessary to maintain an acade-
mic environment at Pitt. This will not be a violation of any-
one’s First Amendment rights, but will only serve to protect
all students, faculty and workers from that which may
infringe on their ability to perform a job. According to
William Savage, director of Affirmative Action at Pitt,
nowhere in the statement does it list words or behaviors
that would violate First Amendment rights. It merely codi-
fies Pitt’s commitment toward stopping harassment abuses
at the university level. Now that’s a battle worth fighting
for.

Israel has had a very difficult time

Mr. Eybers’ article, “War a ques-
tion of petty nationalism,” (Feb. 2)
contains several gross mistakes. In
the first place, I suggest that Eybers
take a course in history to learn
some facts. To say that the creation
of the state of Israel was an action
taken in the 1940s by “European
wariords and Jews” in order to “re—
allocate the Jewish population” is a
falsity. The idea of establishing a
Jewish homeland dates back to the
late 1800s when Jewish intellectuals
conceived of a Jewish state as the
only answer to anti-semitism.
Moreover, Israel’s establishment
had nothing to do with “European
warlords.” The land which was
known as Palestine had been
under British control since the end
of World War I, after the Turkish
empire collapsed. Jews as well as
Palestinians had been living in
Palestine for centuries.

To say that Palestinians are now
subject to “apartheid-like, subhu-
man bondage” is nothing but a lie.
In South Africa, blacks were never
given the right to vote.‘They were
constantly repressed and discrimi-
nated against. When Israel was
declaredastatealltheArabsliving
there were offered citizenship.
Those who accepted Israeli citizen-
ship have all rights which Israeli cit-
izens have and some even serve in
the Israeli army. And “bondage?”
The Palestinians are not slaves!
They have the right to protest. I do
not see any chains on them.

Mr. Eybers also scoffs the fact
that several hundred Palestinians
were deported as “Islamic
Fundamentalists.” The Palestinians
which Israel deported are members
of Hamas, a radical terrorist group.
What Mr. Eybers conveniently
neglects to mention is that Hamas
has a bloody record of terrorism, is
opposed to the peace process, co‘n-
demns Israel's very existence and is
blatantly anti-semitic. Not only have
Hamas members murdered inno-
cent Israelis, they have been
responsible for the brutal deaths of
53 Palestinians suspected of collab-
orating with the Israeli govemment
in the last year.

In its 1988 covenant, Hamas is

clear on its objectives: “There is no

‘ solution for the Palestine question

except through Jihad [Muslim holy
war]. Initiatives, proposals and
international conferences are a
waste of time and vain endeavors.
Palestine is an Islamic land.” An
October 1990 leaﬂet passed out by
Hamas states “view every Jew  as
a target to be killed, whose blood
and money are for the taking.” 
Hamas is a danger not only to
Israel’s security but to the
Palestinians who live in terror
alongside them. The U.N., never-

‘LETTERS

 

theless, has condemned Israel for
deporting these terrorists.  Mr.
Eybers would also condemn
Germany.

The third and perhaps most dis-
turbing statement made in this arti-
cle was that the “European irnperi—
alists who enslaved millions of
Africans  forged the world’s great-
est ‘holocaust.”’ How can one be
so arrogant and ridiculous as to say
that  was the “world’s greatest
holocaust?” What are people com-
ing to when they write these types
of things — when they “compete”
for whose blood was spilled more.
This is grotesque. I could list a
whole page of massacres and
attempted genocides which dozens
of religions, ethnic groups and
races were subjected to. Can one
set of killings be “greater” than
another as Mr. Eybers has just
claimed? Of course not.‘ They are
all grotesque. To claim superiority
on which group suffered more is
repugnant

It is disturbing enough to know
that these types of opinions and
unfounded stereotypes exist. It is
even more disturbing, however, to
see students and “educated” peo-
ple of universities subscribing to
these views. Ras Tafari, the emper-
or of Ethiopia said some profound-

ly wise things in front of the
League of Nations in 1935. Mr.
Eybers has manipulated Ras Tafan"s
depth and wisdom for his own

political opinions.

Military no place for gays

Please allow this honorably dis-
charged soldier to offer you some
advice.

1. Do not compare homosexuals
to black soldiers, especially General
Colin Powell. I probably owe my
life and sanity to a few outstanding
black sergeants who were anything
but gay.

2. Soldiers do not like to take
showers with guys who like to take
showers with soldiers. From basic-
training onward there is no privacy
in the shower.

3. A young soldier should never
(in the future) be told that he and
his family are behind a gay soldier
and his/her partner on the housing
waiting list.

4. If the Army does allow homo-
sexuals to join, then how long will
it be before bisexuals (people who
cannot make up their minds),
transsexual and people who have a
fetish for children start to show up
at recruiting offices? I could never
have respected a man that was my
platoon sergeant by day and a drag
queen by night.

5. The president is more con-
cemed with paying his dues to the
homosexual community, that gave
millions of dollars to his campaign,
rather than listening to the advice
of his generals.

6. Now is not the time for social
experimentation in the Army. The
Army has two missions. One is to
prepare for war and the other is to
wage war. Open homosexuality in
today’s Army will certainly interfere
with these missions.

In conclusion, I am not trying to
upset anyone but I am a realist and
thereisevenachancelcouldbe
wrong. Yet that chance is Slim to
none and Slim is out of town.

Problems to solve
in the Middle East

A dark shadow is falling
over the Middle East, and it
may signal the biggest turning
point in our nation’s foreign
policy since the end of the
Cold War. Dreaded by some,
it is greeted withcheers of
enthusiasm by over 400 weary
refugees who have no place
to call home. The darkness
fell last Thursday when the
Israeli High Court of Justice
upheld the deportation of this

for Hamas and make Israel
safer.

Not only is Israel jeopardiz-
ing its own safety, but the
world’s as well. By blatantly
disregarding any notions of
civil rights, Israel is adding
fuel (and support) to the

R cause of Islamic fundamental-

ism and gives Saddam
Hussein a wedge he can use
between the United States and
our Middle Eastern allies. With

These exiled Palestinians,
ejected without so much as a
trial, are not cheering because
they enjoy their new accom-
modations in a frozen camp in
Southern Lebanon. They are
cheering because they know
that for every day they remain
in this no—man’s land they
gain more support for their
cause among fellow
Palestinians still living in
Israel. Upwards of 40 percent
of the Palestinians in the
occupied territories already
support Hamas, which oppos-
es the Middle East Peace
Talks. This number is sure to
rise as Israel continues to defy
the United Nations by refusing
to allow these refugees back
into Israel. And here in lies
the danger.

By continuing to leave these
Palestinians “out in the cold,"
they are jeopardizing their
own national security by
increasing tensions between
themselves and the Islamic
world. The longer these
Palestinians remain in exile,
the more support they will
receive from fellow
Palestinians and from the rest
of the Islamic world. This can
only lead to an increase in ter-
rorist activities against Israel.
Their best strategy is to open
a dialogue with the
Palestinians and the PLO
(which opposes the more fun-
damentalist factions). That will
help undermine. local support

important to gain Arab sup-
port in opposing him.
Israel’s policy toward the
Palestinians is undermining
that support.

There are some who would
argue that we should punish
Israel for not respecting
human rights. Some would
say that we should freeze aid
to Israel in order to promote
liberty and freedom through-
out the world. Some would
say that we should impose
sanctions on Israel in the
interests of truth, justice and
the American way. Wrong.

We should punish Israel
because it’s in our own best
interests to do so. We do not
have the luxury to conduct
our foreign policy on the
basis of justice and fair play.
We do have an obligation to
protect our national interest,
regardless of any moral ideals.
It’s a simple matter of
Realpolitik. And that is why
we must take a hard line with
Israel. That’s why we should
halt aid to Israel. That’s why,
when the subject of sanctions
comes up in the Security
Council, the United States
should not only refrain from

ivetoing it but should support

it with the same enthusiasm
those 400 weary refugees
have for their cause. A cause

which, if allowed to run its»

course, may find itself in a
collision with war. ‘And that is
in no one’s best interest.

Just last week President
Clinton appointed his wife
Hillary to redesign the nation-
al health care system. It was
a major election issue, and it
is no small task. While there
is a need for a revamping of
our health care system, every
solution breeds different
problems.

One polarized suggestion,
is a socialized system with
everyone enjoying the same
kind of medical care. Our
Student Health Center could
be a microcosm of the future
problems waiting to erupt
with national health care cov-
erage, if this is the method of
choice. S

Last week, while waiting
for over an hour in an exam-
ining room, freezing in a
paper gown, I decided it was
time to look elsewhere in the
Pittsburgh area for better
health care service.

Pitt students who don’t
take care of themselves are
putting their health at consid-
erable risk because the
Student Health Center has
proven itself extremely inade-
quate. '

The doctor’s appointment I
had made turned out to be
unnecessary, as I had expect-
ed. It was made at the
request of a nurse who called
me from the Student Health
Center to inform me that my
supposed infection was mis-
diagnosed. My appointment,
essentially, was set up to set-
tle an argument between the
lab andstudent health. The
labwon. I did not have any
type of infection. I wasted my
time and $65.00 for drugs to
fight a non-existent infection.

This mistake was neither
the first nor the last mistake
made by student health. Here
are some diagnostic mistakes
students utilizing the student
health service should be
aware of. Keep in mind,
these are just the few that I’m
aware of.

I know of three students
that were wrongly diagnosed
with mononucleosis, the
stereotyped college student’s
sickness. One student quit

her job in order to get more
rest to recover. Imagine her
delight when Student Health
called her back eight days
later with the good news that
she was just suffering from
the common cold.

My first year I was diag-
nosed with mono. I was sup-
posed to visit the doctor at
Student Health regularly. One
afternoon, two of the always
“cheerful” receptionists
watched me sit and wait an
hour and a half for my doc-
tor, whom they both knew
was in a two-hour staff meet-
ing. I suppose they were too
busy to inform me of this.
They occupied themselves by
joking about students who
called to asked medical ques-
tions that these receptionists
considered silly.

When I finally did get to‘

Jen Geary.

see the doctor, I informed
her that I was having burning
chest pains. I was told the
pain was caused by the
expansion of my liver, :1 corn-
mon symptom of mono. My
pain was politely dismissed
as if I were a hypochondriac.
A visit to the emergency
medical center in my home-
town, 3OO miles away,
proved my complaints were
valid. I had broken muscles
in my chest from coughing
attacks caused by a cold I
couldn’t get rid of due to my _
virus. Because my pains were
ignored for so long my chest
muscles have not healed cor-
rectly and I still have occa-
sional irritation. ‘~
Another student took the
time to fill out all the infor-
mation requested by Student
Health after acceptance to the
university. The information
was especially important
because she is allergic to
penicillin. After a visit to
Student Health, she was pre-
scribed arnoxicillin, a form of
penicillin. Being a first-year
student at the time, not
majoring in a health—rela.ted

field, she was not familiar
with drug terms, and it was
not her responsibility to be.
She trusted the doctor and
took the drugs as prescribed
and ended up in Presbyterian
Hospital’s emergency room
due to nearly—fatal allergic
reactions. Her parents did not
sue Student Health because it
agreed to pay all medical
bills.

A student suffering from a
bladder infection was treated
by Student Health. A month
later the infection had
recurred. This time she
sought help from her doctor
at home. After looking at the
prescription from Student
Health, the doctor explained
to her that this drug could
only subdue symptoms, not
kill infectious bacteria.

My last horror story comes
from a girl who was told by a
doctor that her common
yeast infection was a sexually
transmitted disease known as
chlamydia. The girl was upset
and bewildered as to how
she caught this. She was
relieved to find out from a
gynecologist in Squirrel Hill
that Student Health had made
yet another inexcusable error.

Pitt has highly-ranked med-
ical, nursing and health—relat-
ed programs, and it is
immersed within a group of

from. "Why then is the health
care so inadequate? The
answer is simple, no doctor
in his/her right mind would
work for peanuts when they
could make big bucks in a
hospital or private practice.
There is no excuse for the
incompetence the Student
Health Service has displayed.
Although our Student Health
fee is relatively low ($92/yr),
compared to medical costs of
the real world, it appears the
Pitt Student Health standards
are even lower. If this health
coverage system is inefficient
for 30 thousand students,
how efficient will it prove to
be for 270 million Americans?

Hillary Rodham redeﬁnes the role of the first lady

The. inauguration of President
Bill Clinton was less than a week
old when ‘I picked up a copy of
People Wee/cl)’ rnagzrzine. It wasn’t
the “Special Inauguration Section"
blurb that caught my eye, but
rather the person gracing the
cover —— First lady Hillary Clinton.
The “Special Inauguration Section"
turned out to be an article about
Hillary Rodham Clinton’s child-
hood (including a two-page photo
layout). as well as anarticle con-
cemed with her changing fashion
styles. After reading the two
pieces, it suddenly dawned on
me. As President Clinton
promised, America is approaching
a season of renewal. People will
expect changes in the economy,
the health system, the deficit, etc.
What they won’t expect is the
changing role of the fust lady. She

will no longer be just the presi-
dents wife.

Perhaps the comparison to the
void she is replacing is one reason
for so many raised eyebrows.
Barbara Bush was the epitome of
the passive first lady. Her husband
concerned himself with the coun-
try’s affairs while Barbara worked
on her own pet projects, as most
first ladies do. She did not force
opinions about President Bush’s
right or wrong decisions, but
rather remained in the shadows,
emerging only at the appropriate
times to shake hands and wave to
the public. Nothing wrong with
this, but nothing exciting either.
And with change comes excite-
ment.

Hillary Clinton will assume an
active role in her husband’s presi-
dency. She will voice opinions

about his decisions. President
Clinton defended her role in tran-
sition discussions, saying “she
knew more than we did about
some things.” Hillary has solutions
to offer. Clinton announced she
will oversee the reformation of the
health care system, one of the

, Kelli
Kanhofer

most important factors during the
campaign (ie. this is not a pet pro-
ject).

If Hillary Rodharn, politically
active Yale Law School graduate
and member of Bill Clinton’s team,
offered ideas and observations,"
criticism would be obsolete. At
least the belief that women are

incapable of handling such posi-
tions has faded. The key differ-
ence here is that she is Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Many Americans
question a first lady’s role in gov-
emment, simply because such a
public role didn’t exist until now.
And the emphasis is on the
word public. Let’s face it, presi-
dents asking their wives for
advice, suggestions and observa-
tions is nothing new. Thoughts of
Nancy Reagan come to mind —-—
the image of Ronald Reagan as
a puppet with Nancy pulling
the strings. What bothered
many people about this scenario
was that it was so secretive.
We did not know how well
informed (or uninformed) Mrs.
Reagan was about issues for
which she voiced opinions.
America knows up front ‘where

Hillary stands —-— it is at her hus-
band’s side in the public eye.
Quite a change from behind
closed doors. If the U.S. health
care system is in the real mess that
everyone says it is, we should wel-
come advice on reformation from
a person who appears capable,
not take the time to debate over
rwho she is.

Change. It was the basis of Bill
Clinton’s victory. Never before has
America encountered this kind of
promised presidency, nor wel-
comed it with such enthusiasm
and optimism. We must look at
every ahgle with open minds. Her
name aside, Hillary’s knowledge
and credentials show she might
offer positive insight. This adminis-
tration will be trying new
approaches. Iet’s try to do the
same. ‘

CHILLY MOST

By Rob Pugliese

Sports Assistant

It’s 1993 and rap music is dominating the music industry
like never before.

With the prevailing abundance of talents and styles, an
artist needs skills that set him or her apart.

Versatility is the trademark of rap's ne\x' breed of super-
star. It’s not just about rhyming skills but writing verses,
creating beats, producing tracks and mixing the product.
That’s what makes funky technicians like Dr. Dre and Pete
Rock the hottest names on the scene.

Chilly Most possesses all these necessary skills and he’s
ready to bust out. Chilly Most is 22-year-old Adam Lewis,
the Rap Director for Pitt’s WPTS — 98.5 FM. While that con-
sumes a great deal of his time and energy, it merely begins
to convey his involvement in the rap industry.

His debut El’, Target Prctctice, is tentatively set for inde-
pendent release later this month. Chilly Most will also be
co—headlining “the Final Frontier" along with another
emerging force, New Basix, Saturday night in the William
Pitt Union Assembly Room, beginning at 8:15. Also
appearing will be E.Z. Access and Potentially Dangerous.
A ﬂavorful freestyle preview of the headlining acts is set
for Friday night on 98.5 FM between 9 p.m. and 1 21.111.

Chilly Most started writing rhymes back in 1986. basical-
ly out of boredom, he said. He became serious about rap-
ping during his senior year in high school back in '88.
During his first year at Pitt, he took things a step further.
delving into the production aspects of the industry.

“I like to produce and hear my creation come out on
tape, as far as the beats go,” Chilly said. "It's like ‘damn I
didn’t expect it to sound this good.”

Chilly stepped in as PTS’ rap director about a year and a
half ago and has relished the opportunity to learn as much
as possible about the industry. including the vital aspect of
promotion — something Chilly continually stresses.

“One thing that I do as rap director is every convention
that I have a chance to go to, I’m there." he said. “I get to
promote what’s going on here in Pittsburgh as far as the
rap scene, what my role is on the radio, like how we
break a lot of new music  granted. Pittsburgh’s a town,
but they can compete with the best of them.

“We have a good market and I let them know from the
head there’s no bootleggers, so every sale is legitimate.
Basically I put Pittsburgh on the map wherever I go."

These conventions shed light on the less—than—glamorous
aspects of the industry. Problems arise for young artists
because of labels and record executives who are less than
sincere with potential signees. Chilly cited executives from
New York, who often come across as narrow-minded and
have tunnel—vision focused toward purely New York
artists.

“New York is stuck on this thing, it’s dope cause its
New York. New York is it. If it ain’t happening in New
York, it ain’t happening. I’ve heard that said plenty of
times up there.”

Ironically, New York is home to one of Chilly’s first and
foremost inspirations. “Early on it was Chuck D. for the
powerful voice," he said. “He was to me one of the ulti-
mate rappers, because at the time he was coming hard-
core, minus the profanity. But he also had the ultimate
delivery. Nobody could touch him for delivery."

Chilly also cited Big Daddy Kane as an early inﬂuence,
and these days it is Kool G Rap, Ice Cube and Scarface. As
far as producing goes, Chilly cited Dr. Dre, The Bomb
Squad and the early WOrk£'Of Marley Marl as primary influ-
ences. ~ ~

I-Iis calm, laid—back pé_rsona helps Chilly maintain his
perspective and focris,“é_s§)l:e:ciirlly in this crazy industry. But
he admits to getting at times, a trait that pushes

Though pianist Geri Allen
lived in Pittsburgh for only a
brief time, she considers those
three years a formative period
in her development as a musi-
cian.

From 1979 to 1982, Allen
pursued a master's degree at
the University of Pittsburgh.
While in town she met and
played with a number of musi-
cians and noticed the close
relation between the people
and their music.

“Pittsburgh still has that feel-
ing to me of the music being
right in the community and the
community right there in the
music,” the soft spoken pianist
said. “That doesn’t happen so
much in a lot of places any-
more.”

FOR PITT STUDENTS. FHCIILTY 8 STGFF

Jazz tradition in hand,

This Saturday, Allen returns
to Pittsburgh with her trio for a
performance at the Manchester
Craftsman’s Guild.

Allen’s history consists of
changes geographically as well
as musically. Born in Detroit,
she attended Cass Tech High
School, which spawned jazz
musicians such as bassist Ron
Carter and saxophonist Kenny
Garrett. She studied there
under trumpeter Marcus
Belgrave, who played with Ray
Charles and jazz legend
Charles Mingus.

After graduating in 1975, she

‘attended Howard University,

where she studied classical
music as well as jazz. Four
years later she moved to New
York.

Not feeling quite comfortable
there, she moved to Pittsburgh
after receiving a call from Dr.

Nathan Davis. He offered Allen
a teaching position at Pitt
along with a chance at a mas-
ter’s in ethnomusicology,
studying music from around
the world.

While Allen attended Pitt,
she discovered and met some
Pittsburgh natives who went
on to become jazz legends,
such as bassist Ray Brown and
the late drummer Art Blakey.
Both men played important
roles in the development of
be—bop.

She also came in contact
with a number of young musi-
cians who were .just starting
out. Jeff Watts, now the drum-
mer on the “Jay Leno Show,”
also attended Pitt at that time.
She also met Dwayne Dolphin,
a young bassist who now plays
in her band.

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, February 4, 1993

Pianist Geri Allen returns on key

in 1982. After a rough start, the
calls began coming in and she
was performing regularly.

She played a founding role
in the M—BASE collective, a
diverse group of musicians fea-
turing electric funk saxophon-
ist Steve Coleman and guitarist
Vernon Reid, of Living Color.

Allen made a few recordings
with a number of different
musicians, and Downbeat
Magazine gave her the distinc-
tion of Talent Deserving Wider
Recognition several years in a
row.

But it wasn’t until 1991 that
she had her first major label
release. The Nztrturer on the
famous Blue Note Records
label. The album featured per-
formances by her former men-
tor Marcus Belgrave.

Last year saw the release of
Maroons, also on Blue Note.

  

Rather than playing with one
group of musicians for the
album, the lineup changed
from song to song, adding
more dimension to Allen’s
already unique compositions.

Maroons featured two differ-
ent dmmmers and bassists, one
of them being Allen’s old
friend Dwayne Dolphin. “And
They Parted” and “Feed The
Fire 11” had both rhythm sec-
tions playing together.

The idea for the extended
band came to Allen after play-
ing with both rhythm sections
separately.

“Both trios had developed
very different things. Because
of the personality of the play-
ers it dictated different
approaches to the music,” she
said in a phone interview. “So
I thought it would be interest-
ing to have what we worked
out represented in terms of
both trios and them put them
together.”

She’s happy with the results.
“We really played like one
thinking mind,” she says. “The
record really formed itself
around the band.”

which will perform this week- ,

end, features Dolphin and

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February 4, 1993

By Brendan Bagin
For The Pitt News

Sometime ago, on my birthday, when vinyl
still counted for something, I received a gift
that made an everlasting impression on me. It
was a double record originally recorded in
1972, the album was Exile On Main Street by
the Rolling Stones.

After several listenings, often back to back, a
change came over me, what was once puppy
love for the band and its often—played and too-
often heard classic tracks, became an obses-
sion.

The album was the embodiment of what I
understood to be rock-’n’—rol1; a slap in the
face, a kick in the butt and a kiss on the
cheek. The sound was experimental, yet
seeped with blues tradition, each of the 18
tracks conjures up separate images of all—night
partying, dancing and love making, as well as
bitterness, frustration, hope, fate, freedom and
survival — none of which could be adequately
conveyed in a music video. ,

It’s the music’s willful desire not to be inter-
preted which gives it its stature (good luck
deciphering the lyrics). The listener is left only
to feel and imagine and to place his or her
own subjectivity on the piece. Needless to say,
many others have been inspired by this and
other work by the Stones. Here we are, over 20
years later, and a day doesn’t go by without
hearing a song with the band’s obvious inﬂu-
ence, from the Black Crowes to Izzy Stradlin
and the Ju Ju Hounds. The sound is unmistak-
able, if not indescribable.

Yet, the story of the Stones is still not com-
plete, not as long as Keith Richards has any-
thing to do with it. The world—renowned
rhythm guitarist has never been one content
with the past. He continually reworks the style
which made him a pioneer of rock.

In 1988, after 25 years of musical collabora-

Stone Richards is a true soul survivor

tion with Mick and the boys, Richards finally
released his first solo LP. It was this album,
Talia 15 Cheap, which shattered my opinion of
Jagger being the heart and soul of the Stones.
The album, which revealed the same bluesy R
& B inﬂuences of earlier Stones vinyl, featured
an updated sound. Keith’s classic fuzz—guitar
noise, joined by Steve ]ordan’s snappy drum-
ming, an assortment of horns and beautiful
backing harmonies filled the album with vitali-
ty and emotion. The ballad, “Looked Away” is
especially moving.

The fall of 1992 brought the release of Mr.
Richards second solo effort, Main Oﬂender
which offers much of the same, thanks to the
return of his band, the X—Pensive Winos. These
include: Waddy Wachtel on guitars, Jordan on
drums, Ivan Neville on piano, Charlie Drayton
on bass and Sarah Dash, Bernard Fowler and
Babi Floyd on background vocals.

The time passed between albums has
brought the band closer together rather than
farther apart — no easy feat in today’s tumul-
tuous music industry, a credit to musicians true
to their craft. The diversity of songs, from
upbeat rockers “Wicked as it Seems,” to sooth-
ing ballads “Hate it When You Leave” to a reg-
gae number “Words of Wonder” never leave
you bored. Keith’s raspy vocals are in peak
form, though much easier to understand.

Still, the lyrics of the tunes are open to inter-
pretation, leaving listeners free to form their
own mental pictures of what the song conveys.
Like Keith says in the song “Will but You
Won’t,” I love the way that it feels. The spirit of
rock—’n’-roll is alive and well within Mr.
Richards — he is a true soul survivor.

Defying the odds. Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon search for a cure in Lorenzo ’s Oil.

What do you do when you
are told that your son has a
mysterious illness that destroys
the nerves in his body? One
that will slowly rob him of his
sensory and motor functions
and eventually kill him? Worst
of all, one for which there is
no treatment and little
research. Do you rage at fate?
Surrender to hopelessness and
despair?

What about finding the treat-
ment yourself?

by George Miller, is the story
of these courageous people
who loved their son too much
to give up hope.

When their son was diag-
nosed, the Odones heard a lot
of hard facts. ALD is a rare
genetic disease, carried only by
females and manifesting only
in males. The disease is so rare
that there was very little
research relating to it. The doc-
tors could offer no hope for
Lorenzo, and very little infor-
mation beyond the symptoms
he could face before death —
which included paralysis,
blindness, deafness and muta-
tion. Instead of accepting the
doctors’ answers of a hospice,
the Odones decided to find
one of their own.

They faced an almost impos-
sible task. He was an econo-

mist, she a linguist. Together,
they investigated a disease that
had baffled doctors, bio-
chemists and geneticists for
years. If this wasn’t enough,
they received little help from
the medical community and
the ALD foundation, both of
which stressed the need to
simply accept the slow
progress of medical science
and their sons eventual fate.
Not listening, and constantly
questioning authority, the
Odones themselves searched
for a cure that would stop the
disease from destroying their
sons nerves.

Their work is a race against
time as Loren’/.o rapidly
declines. First, he looses all
motor control, next his speech
is gone. Miraculously, the

. 808 State

Gorgeous
Tommy Boy/ ZTT

After a year hiatus from the musical scene, 808
State has released its latest album, Gorgeous. The
band’s two previous works, Utd. State 90 and
Ex:E/, were released during “I come from

9 Manchester and U don’t scene” phase when the

band was at its height of its popularity, selling out
venues and releasing its “Optical 90,” a video cas-
sette of live performances and musical videos.
After the huge response to electronic sounds, 808
State took a recess and let others dominate the
dance scene.

“It’s to be faster! More bass! More noise!” is the
continuing phrase coming from the latest techno
egos. However, 808 State has stayed within its
platform for making tunes, being more tranquill
and organized in creating songs. Fifty-two instru-
ments (a list appears in the album infonnation)
ranging from a Casio FZ1OM sampler to tenor
saxophones were used on the band’s new albtun.
808 State has also included samples from “Start”

= by The jam and _“She’s Lost Control” by Joy

Division on the album.

“Colony,” the first track, has the aggressive tech-
no sound, but not the hardcore, dissonance of
many. It’s a rave tune, but has 808 State’s musical
signature. “Moses” features guest vocals from Ian

’' McCulloch, ex-vocalist for Echo 8: the Bunnymen.

Keeping with a slow and musical style, it’s very
reminiscent of early New Order. A good song and

a reason to buy the album. “Contrique” and T

“Nimbus” are dancy songs, highlighting 808
State’s musical talent showing that it actually spent
time in the studio perfecting its sound.

“Orbit,” “10x10,” “Black Morpheus” and

l “Southern Cross” are pretty lame, the band might
A have included these to fill space. A remixon
; UB40’s “One in Ten” is done. It keeps the reggae

percussions, but combines it with its samplers.
“Plan 9” begins with an acoustic guitar, a very
sluggish song for 808 State, but the pace increases
eventually.

“Europa” is a quality track, it stars guest vocalist
Caroline Seaman. She sings her lyrics identical to
Elizabeth Fraser, Vocalist for Cocteau Twins,
which the song borrows heavy inﬂuences from.
“T imebomb,” the first single from the album, has
been consumed by the commercial dance scene.
This is hardcore rave, it’s fast, has deep bass and
controlled noise. When 808 State had to make a
rave tune, it made a prime example for others to
follow.

“Stormin’ Norman,” which loops the bassline

from The Jam is a simple, happy tune that charac-
terizes early New Order. “Sexy Dancer” and “Sexy
Synthesizer” are more of the happy tunes featur-
ing good beats and the vague sound of early ‘80s
synth—music.

It was going to be hard to have a better album
after the biilliant Ex.-El album. But, 808 State has
definitely grown in style. The techno scene, that
the band helped start, has not undermined its
sound. This album is the mellow techno sound,
which it creates and then manipulates.

Oil

Continued from page S-5
Odones found a combination
of two oils that would stop the
disease from progressing.
Although unable to reverse
their sons condition,
“Lorenzo’s Oil” does stop him
from deteriorating further and
saves hundreds of boys world-
wide. The Odones went on to
organize the first ALD sympo-
sium and helped fund the
research for the next step in
curing their son — a way to
repair his damaged nerves.

From this synopsis, Lorenzo 3‘
Oil would not appear to have
much separating it from a typi-
cal “disease of the week” film
on television. But the film is
much more than a weepy
chronology of Lorenzo’s
decline and their fight to find a
cure. Instead, it explores the
many issues that families of the
terminally ill must face, and the
film does so with grace and
integrity. Director Miller never

sugar coats his story, and the A

result is a drama infused with
both tension and hope.

The main source of both‘

emotions is'Susan Sarandon, as

S Lo'renz"o’s moth‘eTr.7-From the ..
time of his diagnosis onward,‘
A she’ centers her’ life around her

son and nothing else, forsakingp

family, church, housework, her
feelings and, in some ways,
her husband. She single—mind—
edly cares for her son, never
once believing that he will not
recover. It’s an obsessive kind
of love — one that consumes

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA '
VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV

and controls her, and the film
allows us to see both positive
and negative aspects of it.
Sarandon gives a tense, grip-
ping performance as this
woman who clings so desper-
ately to her son instead of sim-
ply letting him go. l

Nolte‘ also shines as Augusto,
whose refusal to accept the
doctor’s answers drives him to
find one of his own. Nolte
brings the mix of pain, love
and devotion that supports this
drive to the screen with skill,
allowing us to experience the
full gamut of this man’s emo-
tions. ' '

One of the most compelling
issues faced by the loved ones
of a patient in Lorenzo’s condi-
tion is when to hang on and
when to let go. Everyone tells
the Odones that their son’s
mind is gone, that the faculties
which made him their son
have already died and that his
body’s death would be a bless-
ing. The temptation to give in
to this despair is strong, but
the Odone’s never falter. In
return, they find hope of cur-
ing him, plus thousands of
other sufferers of neurological
diseases. This is an amazing
story of extraordinary people
and proof that miracles do
happen. But Lorenzo’s miracle
is not an easy one, and is still
in progress. The film’s closing
— videos of the thousands of
children saved by Lorenzo’s'oil
is a final testament to the
Odone’s tenacity and valor.

drummer Chris Dave. She feels
very confident about both
members of the band.

“Dwayne is an excellent
musician,” she said, “and I
think you’re going to see a lot
more of him as a leader, a very
visible force in music.”

Dave, a student of Allen’s
from Howard University where
she teaches part time, is old 20
years old and very ambitious,
she said.

Although Dolphin still lives
in Pittsburgh, Allen believes
that doesn't hinder the continu-
ity of the group. “Sometimes
you make a sacrifice to be able
to maintain that continuity to
have a band,” she said. “I-Ie’ll
come up here and we’ll prac-
tice on new material. We’re
able to work through it.“

Allen plans to keep her
group going and also focus
more on her own composi-
tions. She wants to expand the
lineup of her current group for
a recording, but doesn’t want
to elaborate just yet since plans
are “still in the mix."

For now, Pittsburgh jazz fans
owe it to themselves to see this
Ms. Allen, one of jazz music’s
most promising young jazz
musicians.

across the Mekong Delta
and onto a girl leaning
against the railing of a river
ferry. Wearing a man’s hat
and women’s shoes, Jeanne
Moreau’s (the aging beauty
in La Femme Nikita) voice
tells us what you’ve proba-
bly guessed - this is no ordi-
nary girl.

Director Annaud recreates
French Indochina in 1929 as
a visual spectacle. The cam-
era takes great pains to
equate the eroticism of the

film’s interracial affair
between an 18-year-old
white French girl (Jane

Marsh) and a 32-year-old
Chinese man (Tony Leung)
with that landscape. The
clatter of the colonial city

becomes integrated with
their meetings in the “bache-
lor’s room.” Annaud creates
an auditory parallel between
the sounds of the city and
the sounds of love. Each
seems to feed off of the
other.

Driving the erotic are the
circumstances of their affair.
Her family’s poverty and her
lover’s wealth add to a for-
bidden climate. Annaud sim-
ply does not work with this
aspect of the story. The
colonial circumstances
which surround the film’s
action are exposed by the
camera, but The Lover tries
to co-opt that landscape into
an erotic vehicle. The girl’s
family is forced to accept
her affair because of the

money she is given. Her
older brother (an opium
addict) abuses the family
and her lover in a pathetic
attempt to assert himself,
exposing the film’s only real
commentary on colonialism.
Somehow, Annaud expects
this environment to carry the
affair. By film’s end it
appears far too complex for
that task.

In the midst of this
remains Annaud’s focus on
the body, which is not limit-
ed to the girl. The. camera
presents both characters as
highly-eroticized individuals,
clothed or not. The Chinese
lover is idle wealth, his
smooth, almost unmasculine,
beauty becomes a curiosity.
Marsh’s character seems fas-

cinated that he doe.s nothing
but love. There is a constant
examination of the nubile
body of the girl as she walks
through the city. Both
become physical culmina-
tions of something deeply
complex.and often
obscured.

What keeps all this from
looking silly? Its Annaud’s
use of the voice-over to tell
this story from the mouth of
the author, Duras. Moreau’s
voice takes us through this
landscape, which, however
beautiful, is never really
understood. What serves as
balance to the film’s eroti-
cism is its constant connec-
tion to the story being told
by that slow, evocative voice
recalling the past.

Continued from page S-1
him to get things done, on his terms.

Chilly said some of his lyrics have a
strange ﬂavor, partly due to his writing
process. “I do most of my writing around
five in the morning, and I’m half asleep,”
he said. “I’m coming up with zany stuff 
I‘m like what the. hell? It sounds kind of
crazy, it made me laugh at the moment so I
put it in. And if it keeps my attention when
I’m frilly awake, then I keep it.

He wrote all the lyrics on Target Practice
and produced all the beats to his own lik-
ing, which is not the easiest of tasks.

“I‘m picky. I’m Very finicky. I’m hard to
please.”

Chilly Most tries to ensure that the fin-
ished product will meet his own lofty stan-
dards. which explains his eagerness to
work independently.

However, he is actively corresponding"
with a number of record labels, including
Cold Chillin’, and is anxiously waiting on a
reply from Priority Records.

Chilly received a negative response from
Def American Records, but does not appear
phased.

“I think I scared them away with my song
‘Being Black Is The Shit,’ truthfully,” Chilly
said. “That's my opinion, but of course
they’ll run some b.s. saying ‘no, no that's
not it.’ But I think that’s what it is ‘cause
they don’t want anything that’s socially con-
scious. They want brain dead music.”

Ideally he would like to work with a
smaller label and specifically mentioned
Priority, who he said “doesn’t have any real
hangups about censorship of music like
your Warner Bros. or Atlantic."

“If I wrote the material, obviously I want-
ed it to be put out the way that I wrote it,”
he added.

This has led to consideration toward
releasing his material independently.

“I think independent would be a good
way to go to start out ‘cause that way if a
label decides they want you, then they
have to pick‘ you up more on your terms
than if they just pick me up right here and
now from where I’m at.”

For the most part Chilly remains disdain-
ful concerning labels and their censorship,
and what he perceives to be a double stan-
dard as far as rap music goes in comparison
to other genres.

“Oh, that's Madonna, that’s how she is.

WHAT DO THE FOLLOWING HAVE IN

The real to reel to real y'all. Chilly Most relaxing in the studio.

Well, why can’t they accept the rap music
the way that it is,” he said. “Everybody has
a different outlook on stuff, and it should
be put out as such.”

Though Chilly devotes a great deal of
effort to freestyle lyrics, his music is not
without its messages. Sometimes that
involves being a role model for little kids,
like on his track “Being Black Is The Shit.”

“When I was coming up I was always
taught ‘black — bad. bad, bad.’ I’m teach-
ing them to respect themselves, love them-
selves, love their color. I don’t want them
to be ashamed.”

On Target Practice, Chilly deals with

issues close to his heart, such  senseless
killings on “To Preserve A Race.” “That’s
basically aimed at the brothers that are
going around shooting other brothers over
a color, or over girls or basic stupid shit,
over tennis shoes which they can buy
another pair plenty times over because
most of them sell drugs.

"I talk about things that are near and dear
to me. Whenever I write a song, I have

something in my mind.”

Chilly Most is a man with visions --
about himself, his music, rap music in gen-
eral and most of all, the future of our ten-
sion—fil1ed society. He is not one to dodge
the issues, or his potential status as an
example to his peers and future generations
of young entrepreneurs.

“I let them know I can be a role model,
but I am the average person, just like you,"
Chilly said. “Granted, you know I want
peace, but I won’t let you exe.rcise anything
on me. We can be down as long as you
want to be down, but if you try to pull my
card then I'm quick to pull yours. If you’re
willing to work with me I can work with
you, and it’s like that."

This five-song EP begins
with “My Aquarium (the

sion. The original album
version, also appears on
this. The original was a
duet between Greg and
Paula and a lonely guitar
playing. Rather than boring
us with the same version,
the band plays a more hos-

“Nausea” is a melodic
tune about teenage angst.
The best part about the
song is when Greg yells,

the singing with Greg
sounding like Bob Dylan
on a good day. The next
track, “Movie,” is a sleeper.

It’s no longer the cheesy,

By Rob Pugliese

Sports Assistant

Sweet satisfaction.

The mischievous smile on
Lance Miller’s glowing face told
the story.

And while the end of this
chapter left Miller and his
Villanova teammates rejuvenat-
ed, it only left Pitt fans somber
and wary of yet another promis-
ing season that may slide
painfully into the mull of medi-
Ocrity.

The struggling Villanova
Wildcats came into the Civic

Arena and
s t u n n e d
1 5 t h -
ranked Pitt,
8 2 - 7 6 ,
before a
l i f e l e s s
crowd of
11, 364 last
night. Pitt (13-4, 6-4 in the Big
East) performed erratically in los—
ing its second consecutive game
while Villanova (7-9, 3-7) won
its second straight Big East game
for the first time this season.

“I thought our kids did a great
job tonight,” Villanova head
coach Steve Lappas said. “I
thought we’ve played like this all
year, except for the last four
minutes.”

The ‘Cats reversed a season-
long trend by taking the game
from Pitt during crunch time,
rather than giving yet another
close one away. Villanova clung
to a 68-67 lead with 4:06 rernain—

ing, but Miller and James Bryson
took control in opening the lead
to eight points in the final
minute.

“I thought it was up to us to
respond in the last four min-
utes,” Lappas said. “I thought
our halfcourt offense was super.
I thought the offense was com-
ing on, the kids are adjusting to
the motion.”

Miller scored 20 of his game-
high 27 points in the second
half, including six in a critical 8-0
‘Nova run that transformed a 58-
58 deadlock to a 66-58 Wildcat
lead.

Miller unleashed his frighten-
ing repertoire of athletic moves
in canning nine of 14 field goals,
while hitting eight of nine from
the free throw line. He added
four assists and three steals.

“He picks his spots better and
that’s the main thing with
Lance,” Lappas said. “When he
picks his spots, he can go to the
hole with the best of them.”

The silky smooth 6-foot-6-inch
senior received plenty of help
from fellow senior Bryson.

“James and Lance were big
down the stretch for us and
that’s whose gotta do it,” Lappas
said.

Bryson riddled Pitt’s interior
defense for 20 points and set the
tone for the entire night by bolt-
ing from the blocks for the ‘Cats’
first six points of the night.
Things remained tight for most
of the first half, but a 6-1 rnini—
spurt gave Villanova a 27-22 lead
that it would build to seven

Mz'ﬂer's mischief leaves Panthers with second straight loss

before taking a 57-31 margin
into the locker room.

While Miller, the ‘Cats main
man, grabbed this game by the
throat, the Panthers’ go-to guy
Jerry McCullough, suffered per-
haps the most frustrating night of
his young Panther career.

McCullough managed 13
points and six assists, but shot
just frve—of-14 from the field and
a miserable 1-9 from three-point
land.

His night also required spend-
ing some tough minutes on the
bench, watching seldom-used
first-year guard Andre Alridge
log 13 minutes. Entering this
game, Alridge had played only
five minutes all season and a
grand total of one minute in
conference action.

To the Panthers credit, they
did hang tough, making repeat-
ed runs at the ‘Cats and actually
taking a 52-49 lead on a three-
point play by Orlando Antigua.
Pitt led 54-51 before Bryson
ignited the ‘Cats again with a
three-point play and a hook shot
to put Villanova up 56-54.

The Wildcats burned the nets
at a 58-percent clip, after hitting
better than 62 percent from the
floor in the first half. Meanwhile,
Pitt looked like a team that had
not practiced since last
Wednesdays Syracuse debacle,
shooting a pathetic .345 from the
floor in the opening 20 minutes.

Things would not improve sig-
nificantly after intermission, with
Pitt connecting on a paltry 41

Pitt zoned out again

The Pitt Panthers, after jump-
ing out to a terrific 15-3 start
and a nrunber 15 ranking, have
reminded fans not to get too
excited. They are, after all, still
the Panthers -— a young, talent-
ed team playing perhaps a little
over their heads and in need of
stability to continue their
improvement.

And their coach is still Paul
Evans, who continues to reas-
sure all of us that he can still do
the things necessary to lose a
basketball game.

The burning question after
last nights 82-76 loss to
Villanova was: Where was Ice?

The answer: Sitting on the
bench resting his head in his
hand while watching a very
winable game slip away. His
replacement, first-year student
Andre Alridge, who had seen
only one minute of conference
play entering the game, was
given the responsibility of run-
ning the offense. It was a
responsibility he could not han-
dle.

Despite bringing more con-
fusion than continuity to the
Panther offense, Evans kept
him in the game. The result
gave the players a sense of
frustration and destroyed those
precious opportunities for Pitt
to take control of the game.

Jones said. “_Ieny’s our man. He
wasn’t in the game at the time.
Andre got his chance. It didn’t
work out.”

“It was awkward,”
McCullough said. “[With
Alridge in the game], it
changed up our offense.”

It sure did. Aldrige first
replaced McCullough with 5:22

after McCullough stole the ball
from Arron Bain and drove the
hoop drawing a foul — usually
not the kind of hustle that gets
you pulled from the ﬂoor. Pitt
was down 25-22 and seemed
on the verge of hitting a
groove, yet out he came,

Finally, with 41 seconds left,

but the damage had already
been done. Villanova had a six-
point lead and the confidence
going into the locker room that
this was a Pitt team that was
ripe for another upset.

With Ice running the show at
the start of the second half, Pitt
played inspiring defense and
smart offense to cut what had
ballooned into a seven-point
Wildcats’ lead to three.
Obviously a prime moment to
pluck your ﬂoor general out.

The hustle continued as
Orlando Antigua and Ahmad
Shareef scrapped and banged
for every loose ball and deliv-
ered with timely baskets to
keep pace with Villanova until
McCullough got back in the
game. But he didn’t replace the
outclassed Aldrige. The hustling
Shareef was sent to the bench
and McCullough was placed in
the awkward two-guard posi-
tion.

But Wddcat lance Miller pro-
ceeded to go on a six-point
rampage in one minute, lead-
ing a surge that the Panthers
were unable to recover from.

The importance of last
night's game could hardly be
overplayed. A victory would
have set the Panthers up for a

Football displays fruits of recruiting labors Wreslters

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

Head coach Johnny Majors
formally announced the fruits
of his recruiting labor at a
press conference yesterday.

Speaking at Pitt Stadium,
Majors said that he has spent
the majority of his time not
directly recruiting but inter-
viewing and putting together
his coaching staff. He has,
however, personally met with
virtually all prospects.

Majors said that the drug
scandal in which two current
Pitt football players and one
former player were indicted for

possession of an illegal sub-
stance played no detrimental
role in the decisions of
recruits.

Majors did not go the route
expected by signing all high
school players. Many felt that
to give an immediate boost to
the program he would invest
in junior college talent, but of
the 13 letters of intent signed
all were from high school ath-
letes.

He has also traditionally
shied away from Prop 48
cases, making this year no
exception.

Most notable among his new
recruits was Pedro Gonzalez, a

Friars in double OT

By Jason Brame

The Pitt women’s basket-
ball team pulled out a stun-
ning 85-84 victory in double
overtime over Providence, a
game that it desperately
needed to keep any hope of
challenging down the stretch
in the Big East.

Carolyn Miller’s layup with
four seconds remaining gave
the Panthers their sixth win
in the conference and their
11th overall, and may have
set them back on track.

Trailing by six points with
11:00 remaining in the game,

the Panthers went on a 12-0
run, keyed by Erin Maloy’s
three-pointer, making the
score 52-49.

prompted a Providence time-

The Friars came out of the

Clemson, Lock Haven,
Navy and Bloomsburg
—— to wrestling fans it
sounds like the second
10 of the Top 20 teams
in the collegiate
wrestling world.

To Pitt wrestling fans
it’s just reality — it’s
their schedule.

While the fans might
not like it, Pitt Coach
Rande‘ Stottlemyer
doesn’t mind at all.
Even as his team visits
a tough Bloomsburg
team tonight he is eager
for the challenge.

‘‘I’m looking forward
to [the Bloomsburg
matchl,” Stottlemyer
said. “I think we’re
ready, we’re getting
better.”

The Panthers are 1-1
in the Eastern Wrestling
League (EWL), and a
win at Bloomsburg
would do wonders.

“It’s a double-win-
and double-loss—type
situation,” Stottlemyer
said of the Bloomsburg
match in which a win
would be an overall
win as well as a victory
in the EWL. “We’re still;
in the hunt for the EWL
title, but were on the
outside, looking in.”

Pitt is standing on the
outside because of a
sluggish match against
Lock Haven in January.
Losing to the Bald
Eagles put them in a 0-
1 hole and raised ques-
tions about the team’s
enthusiasm in the vital
EWL matches.

“We were a little flat,”
Stottlemyer said. “We
had_no real enthusiasm,
no real intensity [in the
Lock Haven match].

“But we gained that
intensity against
Cleveland State last
week,” Stottlemyer said
of Pitt’s 25-15 ousting
of its second EWL
opponent of the season.

Showing more gusto
against Cleveland State,
visiting the Huskies will
be the perfect opportu-
nity for the Panthers to
gain more confidence.

Stottlemyer could not
point out any single
match that could turn
the upcoming
Bloomsburg meet in
Pitt’s favor.

“Boy, there are a lot

Stottlemyer said. “There

Frustrating — but not disap-
pointing.

For Pitt _women’s swim
Coach David Belowich, the
long and winding road
known as the 1992-95 swim-
ming and diving season has
been just that —— certainly not
the desired outcome, but not
dead by any means.

Through nine dual meets
and a potpourri of invitation-
als or opens, the Pitt women
have shown sporadic flashes
of success and failure in their
season on the road — going
just 4-5 in dual meets despite
a number of superb perfor-
mances by the team’s younger
athletes. .

Heading into yet another
pair of weekend meets at
Ohio State and Ohio
University, Belowich is opti-
mistic yet realistic about the
final stretch of the season — a
brutal season that has includ-
ed meets with five opponents
in the Top 25.

“I think we’re a little bit bet-
ter than what we’re showing,"
Belowich said. “It’s a very
young team. I know that
sounds like an excuse  but
they are no longer a young

team. We’ve gone through
three-quarters of the season
now.

“I’m so happy with the col-
lective personalities of the
team. But the frustrating part
is that we have been in sever-
al meets where I think we’ve
had the opportunity to win as
a team, but we came up a lit-
tle bit short."

Belowich points to losses at
West Virginia and at St.
Bonaventure as two meets
that, if done over again,
would probably go Pitt’s way.

“I wish that there was a
way to go back again, today,
and have a chance to swim
some of the teams we lost to,”
Belowich said. “I think that
the outcome would be com-
pletely different.

“I’m frustrated, but I’m not
disappointed. Frustrated so
many times means disap-
pointment. I’m not disappoint-
ed.”

One reason Belowich
shows little disappointment in
the Panthers is the fact the
team has progressed — par-
ticularly the younger swim-
mers. An example of the posi-
tive future of Pitt swimming
—— for the coming weeks or
coming years — is the efforts

Providence an 80-76 lead.

Maloy drained the seventh

Jill Fletcher.

A first—year swimmer
from Rancho Viejo, Texas,
Fletcher has been
admirable from the get—go
for the Panthers -—— filling a
valuable role in valiant
fashion.

“Jill has very adequately
filled Laura—Lee Sullivan’s
shoes,” Belowich said.
“Not that she had those
shoes to fill, but that was a
loss from graduation that
we needed some help in
the breast stroke."

Fletcher has yet to disap-
point in ‘92—")3, displaying
consistent improvement
from the day she hit the
Trees Pool water. In fact.
her growth has been so
dramatic in her primary
events — the 100- and

that she may erase both

mittent rest and work in
the hopes of recapturing
the league championship
—— a trophy the Pitt
women literally owned
until last season, when

Villanova halted the
Panthers’ title run at 10
years.

Belowich admits that
‘Nova ~— led by the. best
swimmer in the confer-
ence, Lisa Flood —— is the
clear favorite to repeat as
Big East champions.
Despite the less—than—s1ellar
season to date, the long-
time Pitt coach doesn’t
hedge the fact that Pitt still
has the goods to win back
the title. He does admit
that it will take a total team
effort —— something Pitt
hasn’t seen all year —— to
get the job done.

“The chance is there,”
Belowich said. “But we
have to have everybody

night’s game and the second
half of the Syracuse game,
Pitt’s outside shooters were
ineffective. Panther guards
have been basically shut
down, unable to escape a stiff
arm in the face to get off a
decent shot. As a result, they
are an abysmal nine of 42

f'rom three—point land in the

past two games.

Another key stat in the loss
to the Wildcats belonged to
Pitt's top scorer, Jerry
McCullough. McCullough was
benched by Coach Paul Evans
with a little over five minutes,
to play, presumably because
of his sub-par shooting (2-of-6
from the floor). Instead of let-
ting McCullough overcome the
roadblock, Evans replaced him
with Andre Alridge, who has
played all of one minute in
Big East games this year.

“I felt Jerry was pressing too

better defensive players,”
Coach Evans said.

Whatever the reason,

.McCullough sat out longer

than he had in any game this
season. As for Alridge, his
game summary read: 13 min-
utes, ()—for~3 shooting, two
fouls, three turnovers.

Another obvious reason for
the Panther downfall —-
‘Nova’s Lance Miller.

Miller ran rings around the

in which he scored 20 of his

game-high 27 points.

Driving the baseline, at the
free-throw line or in the paint,
Miller was simply unstop-
pable. He abused whomever
was guarding him, and was
money whenever he went to
the charity stripe (8 of 9).
With the ‘Cats leading 60-58
with seven minutes left in the
game, Miller put the Panthers
in a ditch they would never
dig themselves out of.

Three straight Pitt turnovers
found their way into Miller’s
hands, then, following a
Pitt score, he sank both
ends of a one-and-one after
being fouled by Shareef
to give Villanova an eight-
point cushion with a little
more than five minutes left.
The Panthers would never
regain the lead.

“I had a bad first half. And
in the second half, I knew I
had to be a senior,” Miller said
after the game. ~

“He was on fire,” said
Wildcat center James Bryson,
who scored 20 points in the
game. “I was real happy to
see him pick it up, and we
saw the old Lance Miller
tonight.”

For the second time in a
row, Panther center Eric
Mobley fouled out late in the
game. Mobley received his
fifth personal with 3:12 left
and Pitt down by only one.
The Panthers’ inside game was

The Panthers owned a

basketball over 16 times to
Villanova’s 20.

The ‘Cats simply shot
the basketball better than
Pitt, which appeared help-
less against a zone defense
just as it did in prior losses
to Georgetown and
Syracuse.

In addition to
McCullough’s shooting
woes, starting off guard
Ahmad Shareef hit just
four of 13 field goals.

“All you have to do is
look at the stats to see we
didn’t shoot it very well,"
Pitt head coach Paul Evans
