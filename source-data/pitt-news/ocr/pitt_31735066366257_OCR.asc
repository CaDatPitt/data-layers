The Pittsburgh Press stated in
its Wednesday edition that the
prospects appear good that the
Pennsylvania State House Appro-
priations Committee will approve

’more than 19 million dollars in

loans for new dormitories. Also
included in the package is a
planning appropriation for a pro-
fessional quadrangle at the Uni-
versity. _ ,

Committee Chairman’ Martin

' P. Mullen, Philadelphia Democrat,

said Dr. David H. ,Kurtzman,
Vice Chancellor of Fiances, and '
Dr. Edgar Cale, Vice "Chancellor
for Planning, had presented an
excellent case to the committee
yesterday for the new student
dormitories .and married student
quarters. .

‘ “They demonstrated that dorm-

itories are needed: for students 

attending the University from sur-_-
rounding counties who are un-

‘able to commute,” Mr.- Mullen

said. -
"“In addition, the ‘professional

Pointing to Pittsburgh as ‘a place where this
is being accomplished, Commager stated, “Amer-
ican cities need a sense of life that has all but
disappeared.” He also explained that the Univer-
sity has a second obligation: “to bridge the gap

between East and West.”

“Most of the forces in government and so-
ciety,” he continued, “are ceaselessly active in
— widening and deeping that gap. Against this cru-
sade to fragment mankind, set ideology against

-« dents, of the local community, of
‘research, that is implacably re-

l_ quired of the American scholar.”
‘ ‘ -“Americans,” he stated, “in-
ivented a’ new kind of university,
_'..one with which all of you are
familiar, one which all of you
take for granted. The university
" is a Western invention; that
-iwhich grew up in Ital)’ in the
,l2th century was an institution
‘to train theologians, doctors, and
'-‘ylawyers.

A,“It was urban, non-residential,

.«.the"1oca1 prince or by the Church
‘and controlled by them in un-
v easy and sometimes turbulent as-
' ociation with the students.”
 Dr. Commager then told how
; the" glish created a second kind
,' ‘I1-university at Oxford and Cam-
ybridge where eventually the “col-
 ege tail came to wag at the uni-
‘iversity dog.” T/hese colleges were
" ocated invthe country, were resi-
i ential, and in loco parentis for
‘the student. The Germans added
-the concept of extensive research
0 the work of their’ universities.
' .“Americans took over "some-
hing from all three models, con-
;-tinued Dr. Commager, “modiﬁed

terests, aims, and activities to
‘make something which, by the

adv.anced character, and built up
reserach libraries and labora-
tories that were the envy of the
Western world.

Dr. Commager noted the rise
of the urban university, stating‘
that “something like three-
fourths of all university students
are in urban institutions.. Some-
times,” he felt, “American urban

universities long for a rural re-
. treat.”

When Americanshgo abroad to
study or to teach, they almost

' invariably go to the large ur-

ban universities, be they in
Paris, Munich, Tokyo, or Lon-
don. “What attracts’ the Ameri-
cans,” Dr. Commager explained,

~.,“are the mature students educat-

ing themselves as students al-
ways do educate themselves when
given a chance, taking the risks
of life, playing a part if only on
the fringes, in literature, politics,
and art, not frittering away their

' energies on intercollegiate ath-

letics and fraternity or sorority
politics or in outwitting faculty
regulations on social hours in
dormitories.”

cording to Dr. Commanger, is"‘a.

SyntheticAPrioriKnowledge_

Discussed At Lecture Series

By SUZAN and JOSEPH DIVACK

Dr. Wesley Salmon of In-
diana University as guest
lecturer at the Philosophy of
Science Center lecture series

Monday night discussed the '

philosophical problems impli-
cit in the concept of synthetic
a priori knowledge.

He deﬁned a priori knowledge
as truth certiﬁable without ref-
erence to the physical world. He

‘ traced in histori'c'al context the

question of the existence of the
synthetic a priori from Plato
through Descartes, Leibnitz and
Kant. The Cartesian View that
scientiﬁc and philosophical in-.
quiry ‘must proceed from First

Principles (considered to be a A

priori knowledge) is no longer
acceptable to modern science.

The 18th century philosopher,
Emmanual Kant, attempted to
resolve the ancient and seeming-
ly insoluble dilemma by‘ claiming
that the axioms of Euclidean geo-
metry . were synthetic a priori.
The’ development of non-Euc1i-
dean geometry revealed a formid-
able Kantian error, i.e., the use
of visualizability as a test of
truth.

By the use of symbolic logic
Dr. Salmon demonstrated the
existence. of formal analytic
truths. In concluding, he em-
phasized that the history of sci-’
ence and philosophy should make
us wary of accepting a prior syn-
thetic propositions since closer
analysis usualLy reveals that
these were incorrectly categoriz-
ed-

In the historical analysis Dr.
Salmon accentuated in detail the
importance played ‘by geometry

as a body of knowledge mo1d- T

ing into form the philosophical
ideas of each era; Plato saw that
geometry could increase know-

ledge synthetically and that its .

conclusions followed deductively.
Kant -could not have postulated
the principle of universal.causa-

nn. WESLEY SALMON
Philosopher Lectures

Kant, saw in the anxioms of‘

Euclidean geometry the potenti-
ality of prediction. Thus, the
axioms possessing this potential-
ity superceded the realm of ana-
lysis and were deemed of syn-
thetic" faculty. Assuming that the
Euclidean system w.as the only
system of geometry, Kant made
an exonerable error. The discov-
ery of the non-Euclidean geome-
tries not much later by Lobat-
shewsky and Bolyai shed a dif-

ferent light on Kant’s interpre-

tation. .

Equally important as evidence
of a priori knowledge was the
belief in first principles. 1);, s31.
mon recounted the tenet held by
Lucretius —’— “Nothing can be

created out of nothing”——as an
example and pointed out that
steady state cosmology recently
suggested that some events do oc-
cur for which there is no suffi-
cient reason. Aristotle sought a
first and a priori principle in the
concept of the “unmoved mover,"
the ﬁrst cause. Descartes, follow-
ing similar lines of reasoning, saw
as much reality in an eﬁicient
cause as there is in its effect.
Dr. Salmon proceeded to de-
velop with logical rigor a meta-
language having such formal ele-
ments as logical constants, pro-
positional variables, functional
variables and formation rules.
The sum of this he called his log-
ical c.a1culus.*By this he demon-
strated hdw it is possible by log-
ical formula from a chosen lan-
guage to create formal analytic
truths. He explained and criti-
cized Carnap’s theory of probabil-
ity as a new synthetic approach.
This theory utilizes prediction
based upon synthetic a priori as

an explication of degrees of con-'

ﬁrmation.

aracter . . . for your inspiration of youth.

e degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris
ausa.’—’-

 So. intoned Acting Chancellor Stanton
rawford as he bestowed one of the Uni-
'   . versity’s highest honors on

_, tory Henry Steele Commag-
er at Fall Convocation, on

fore the House is: “Did he
deserve it?”
Granted, Dr.
hasgachieved signiﬁcant
fame for his writings and
his scholarship. He has been
i _ so successful that it would
ppear to be folly to attempt to sully his
putation. ,

DURING THE summer, the august and
ered Dr. Commager poisoned his pen and
rote an article for Saturday Review (July

‘.,_‘A Historian Looks At Our Political
 _rality”) which probably wasn’t by the
“-B tower of Honorary Degrees. So gather
und, friends and neighbors and list ye to
e delightfully incriminating prose from

gh.
Professor Commager wrote: “The pro-
gnged struggle with Communism which we
metimes call the Cold War, accenuated
iir.‘..'innate sense of superiority. To vast
timbers of Americans it justif-ied—-and ap-
eiitly still does justify—resort to almost
ny weapons or conduct.” - . ._ 2

The good doctor would no doubt be
ockedi to learn that the Communists have
I qualms about utilizing every means at
, ir disposal in their still-valid goal -of
' Id»--domination. Would Dr. Commager
us play the game with our hands tied
ur feet, while our Red brothers remain
ee‘ to batter‘ us into" submission‘? This
liist be the “morality” he is talkingabout.

, UT WAIT! Professor Commager con-
‘ed: “For years now we have heard
i not from extremists alone, that the
_ggle between democracy and Commun-
 issthe struggle between Light and

stinction is an absolute one.”

gislation On The Rocks 
I What Senator Mullen and other legislators fail to notice is the bill
for a $5 million emergency giant to the University. The House passed the

, bill, 188-17, in September and it is still pending in the Senate. This bill is
of paramount importance to the University.

Dr. Stanton Crawford, acting chancellor, said in August that the $5
million emergency gi‘aﬁt~- was the key to the University’s future. If it is
not granted, students eén expect to see an increasing exodus of prominent
professors next trimester. 4

The bottleneck todthis and any other legislation remains the state’s
reapportionment problem. The legislature must reapporfion according to
a recent Pennsylvania Supreme Céurt ruling. -They have failed to meet

the court’s original deadline, and are now, with an extended deadline, re-

Millions of dollars are in the

solving nothing on the reapportionment issue.

In this perspective,» Senator lVlullen’s optimistic remarks stand as an

appeasement to uneasy faculty and administrators. The $5 million “emerg-

  
   

gent.

Carry on, Dr. Commager. "The argu-
_ments that were invoked to justify religious
wars and religious persecutions are invoked
now to justify sleepless hostility to.Com-
munism—even preventive War.” The Army
of Insomniacs had better disband, apparent-
ly, for Dr. Commager doesn’t think we have
to be wary of Communism. But_who should
we ' be Wary of? Dr. Commager has the

Amherst Professor of his-/‘answer’

“WE HAVE not heard of late quite so
much as some months back,” he said, “of
what must surely be counted the ultimate
arrogance—.-the cry of thei‘-better dead than

>Red’. crusaders. Those highly vocal martyrs"
are so sure that they speak for God that r

they are quite ready to condemn to extinc-
tion not only-themselves and their fellow
citizens but the rest of the world.” ’

It certainly is arrogant. isn’t it, to wish
oneself dead rather than to live ﬁnder the
most oppressive and tyrranical form of gov-
ernment on the face of the earth? Dr. Com-
mager wishes to live under such conditions,
let him speak for himself. (Patrick Henry,
anyone?) ' T) ’

Hold on, people, thebest is yet to come:
“When the Russians announced that they

A would not tolerate an unfriendly govern-
ment in Hungary and sent their troops and
tanks crashing into that country in 1956,
_we were rightly outraged, but we think it
1S quite alright for us to announce that we
will not tolerate an unfriendly regime in
Santo Domingo and to“ send 20,000 Marines
to ‘restore order’ to that island.”

HOW ON God's green earth can Pro-
fessor of history Commager equate Russian
intervention in Hungary with American in-
tervention in the Dominican Republic? How ?
The one was a blatantsuppression of free-
dom while the other was an attempt to pre-
vent the advocatesof bloody World revolu-
tion from agrandizing their miniscule power

in this ‘hemisphere. The Soviets acted to,

maintain an unpopular regime in power,\

whereas the U.S. was acting as a result of '

revolutionary subversion by hard-core Com-
munists. Can this" comparison, this gross»
prevarication, come from “eminent histori-
an” Commager? Is this how he “inspires
youth?” Is this his “depths of understand-
ing of American thought and character?”

There is-» much, much more to be said
about Dr. Commager, but the point is made.
Suffice it to say that by his propensity to
distort the facts for his own outlandish con-
clusions, for his 'inability..to perceive any
irreconciable conflicts in the Cold War, and
for his benign attitude towards Commun-

ism, Dr. Henry Steele Commager was not
a}, judicious choice for honor, by this’.Uni-"

  

 

   

ency grant” should receive top priority, then the $19 million loan. But
.-neither can be acted "upon until the weary legislature solves rea_pportion-
ment——an issue in which they've been deadlocked for nearly six months.

Writer Protests
Letter Distortion

Editor, The Pitt News:

Last Friday's issue of The Pitt
News carried a letter supposedly
written by myself which I found
quite offensive. I w.as annoyed
not so much because my. letter
was not printed in its entirety,
but because its intended’ mean-
ing was lost. I wish.at this time
to state, that letter is not the
same letter Iigave to The Pitt
News, neither in idea nor con-
tent.

Besides having edited the let-
ter, deleting my opinion in the
process (as good or bad as that
might have been), the letter in

4 its edited condition "makes no

logical sense. What w.as publish-
ed was a list of facts with some

irrelevant opinion.

" Irecognized the factthat The
Pitt News reserves the right to
edit all letters but I didn’t be-
lieve that this gave them the au-
thority to change the basic mean-
ing intended by the writer. Also,
I wish to state, at this time, that
my letter was mislabeled and
had nothing to do with Nathan
Glazer’s previously’ published ar-
ticle. ‘

Sol Paul Shapiro
- v ' . L. A., ’69

Editor’s note: The Pitt News ’re-‘
grets that a, mix-up with the
headline of the preceeding letter
and unjudicious cutting for the
sake of length distorted Mr. Sha-

V pz'ro’s letter.

‘ISLF’ Coverage
Criticized

Editor, The Pitt News:
There comes a time when the

editorial policies ‘of certain news-
papers must be called into ques-
tion, especially when that policy

"not only disregards the rules'of‘

objective journalism by “color-
ing" its news but also lowers it-
self to printing lies (no matter
who the source).

I am referring to the article
concerning the University publi-
cation Ideas and Figures. Being
rather close to the situation cited,
I feel that I can relate some of
the facts -concerning the publi-
cation. ‘

Ideas and Figures has always
been run on a‘ deﬁcit budget—_
i.e. the printing costs are expect-
ed to and always have exceeded
the returnsiof the magazine. Giv-
en this and the ﬁnancial state of
Pitt, the editor decided to have
Ideas_ and Figures printed for the
least possible cost with hopefully
a maximum of efficiency. He

PPP Advocates New Constitution
Says SG Should Act For Students

Student Government Sen-
ator John Ruskay, Pitt Pro-
gressive Party (PPP) chair-
man, advocated rewriting
the Student Government
(SG) Constitution at the
PPP’s organizational - meeting‘,
Wednesday evening.
Chairman Ruskay‘ announced

that the attendance of only‘i50 5

was probably due to the lackvof

proper publicity for the meeting. A

He then introduced thelspeakers
for the evening: PPP Vice-Chair-
man Charles Hollander, ‘ ‘PPP
Treasurer Gerry Rosen, and Sen-

, ator Rick Schweder.

The speakers declared that the
PPP was formed out of a con-
cern for the plight of the student

at the University. ' They stated’

that SG is merely a token or-
ganization that may speak for
the student, but not to act on his
behalf. I ~

Ruskay also spoke in favor of
a reconstruction and redeﬁnition

of the role of SG in the Univer: -
Sity. Senator Schweder said that

the University student does not
realize his power to inﬂuence and
command action in the formation
of a student legislative ‘organiza-
tion that would act as well as
speak for him.

Commenting on the present sit-
uation of SG, Schweder stated,
“that the _factor controlling the

organization is _the inﬂuence of »

economics upon the‘ administra-
tion’) and that if a student pays
for his education ‘he should con-
trol the institution he is ﬁnanc-
ing. .
Gerry Rosen gave a brief ‘ana-

lysis of the problem of the allo-

cations committee and stated that
the PPP was strongly in favor of
the defeated proposition-’ for a
student referendum, and will con-
tinue to be so in the future. He
said, ‘PPP is for complete student
control of the alolcations com-
mittee. ' I

Ruskay announced two forth-
coming SG bills backed by PPP.

One concerns an investigation of I

the visiting hours in the men's;
dorms and the other, an'inves,ti-
gation‘ of attitudes towards the
distribution of studies program.

.‘*v'

cost of the magazine would equal
the anticipated returns. He hoped
to go to Mexico with theifirst set
of proofs to supervise the-“ﬁnal”

printing of the magazine. No_let- '

ter was ever sent concerning the
trip to Mexico in relation to the
beginning of the magazine.

Another reason cited concem-
ed the stalling of publication was
that the publisher did not have
the typeface requested. The type-
face requested was the typeface
of a sample from Editorial Cul-
tura.

Maybe, just maybe, the insin-
uation of negligence is focused in

‘the wrong direction. Maybe it

should be remembered that I and

F office l_ast year was a constant-'

ly open forum for ideas and that
every coffee hour was jammed
with listeners and participants.

Maybe, but just maybe, the edi-
tor of The’ Pitt News should be .a
little more careful in the selec-
tion of the articles and biases it

Workshop-discussions and a

.,peace caravan concerning United
-"States involvement in the Viet-
liialrnese War will take place to-
-‘night and tomorrow in the Oak-
land area. -
I Preparation is being made for
these events in over 60 cities
within the United States and
throughout the world to coordi-
hate mass protests in opposition
;,to: United States aggression in
?Vietnam,

The Vietnam Day Committee
claimed that demonstrations would
surpass previous anti-war protests
“not only in total numbers and
"intensity of action, but in long-
range beneﬁt to the peace move-
‘ment.’’'

' The emphasis of the national
days of protest is on “community
_ organization and education as
 well as on direct action against
 the war.”

The Students for Peace at the
I University are sponsoring the dis-
.' cussions in conjunction with the
j International Days of Protest in

  
   

524, 306, and 319 SU at 7:30 p.m.
Topics of the workshops will be
historical signiﬁcance of the war;
civil rights, democracy, and the
war; .and how the war aﬁects
Americans as individuals. _

The peace, caravan sponsored
by the Pittsburgh Committee to
End the War in Vietnam will
march, to seven recruiting sta-
tions in the Pittsburgh area. The
schedule is as follows: East Lib-
erty Station, 6124 Center Avenue,
9 to 10:30 a.m.; East Hills Sta-
tion, 9006 Frankstown Road, 10:45
to 11:30 a.m.; and North Side
Station, Post Office Ohio-W. Dia-
mond, noon to 12:45 p.m.

Also McKees Rocks %tation, 807
Chatiers Avenue, 1 to 1:45 p.m.;
South Side Station, 120 Browns-
ville Road, 2:15 to 3 p.m.; Carne-
gie Station, 140 East Main Street,
3:30 to 4:15 p.m.; and Pittsburgh
Station, Federal Building, 4:45
to 5:30 p.m. '

The participants will be from
the entire Pittsburgh area includ-
ing students, non-students, and

Better Teaching Sought

‘Y’ Seminar To Discuss
Undergraduate Teaching

By MARK RAVENSCRAFT
An opportunity for students to discuss ways of upgrad-
ing teaching at the undergraduate levels is being offered
through Project Teach, sponsored by the University’s

YMCA—YWCA.

Faculty and students will participate in seminar groups
designed to consider such questions as the effectiveness of

the teacher, the teaching role
and method, the role of students
in the teaching situation, and stu-
dent responsibilities in the teach-
ing situation.

Frank Watanabe, director of
the YMCA, stated the project is
an “effort on the part of both
faculty and students to ﬁnd meth-
ods and means to upgrade under-
graduate teaching.” Watanabe ex-
plained that small groups of 10
or 12 students and faculty will
meet each week. Every group
will have a student leader, who
will sit on a committee to guide
and select areas of discussion.

Students who wish to partici-
patein Project Teach can obtain
application forms from the YM-
YW office, 210 SU. Watanabe em-
phasized that the effectiveness of
the project will depend entirely
on the desire of the students to
express themselves and become

involved.

Dr. Kenneth Cummins, assis-
tant professor of biology and co-
ordinator of Project Teach, said
that “by starting to improve un-
dergraduate teaching (meaning
freshman and sophomore pro-
grams), We can improve the sys-
tem .as a whole both on under-
graduate and graduate levels.”

Too much emphasis on research

and publications is taking good '

professors out of the teaching
ﬁeld, stated Dr. Cummins. He
feels that at the University, al-
though attention has shifted from
undergraduate to graduate edu-
cation, it is not too late to im-
prove freshman and sophomore
education. One of the ways to do
this is to upgrade the 80’s courses,
suggested Dr. Cummins.

~host Slippery Rock at Forbes
1‘ Field tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.

‘,1’ Except for the halfbacks and
‘ the defensive fullbacks, platoon-
--in"g has been coach Leo Bemis’
« strategy for the rest of the team,
_but not in the way it will be
j used tomorrow. “In all the games,
- I have platooned with my four
from men, but experiments in
scrimages this week may set up
.'two' distinct lines,” he said.

* ‘fOne of the lines would be
-‘composed of all seniors while the
L other would be made up of play-
‘e‘rs who will return next year,”
said Bemis. “This way the boys
' who will return will have gained
= experience, playing together for
a whole season.” i

Sophomores Gary Foertsch, Bob
Racunas, Pete Snyder, and jun-
ior Sal Tavares are the ingredi-
_ ents for Bemis youth squad. The
_ “senior” line includes Aldo Zor-
" ‘tea, Dom Milillo, Dave Shaffer,
and Ferd Sauer. Sauer, who is
just a junior, has been used main-
ly with the other line.

Another experiment tried by
Bemis in practices is the installa-
tion of Zortea at the center for-
ward position. The reason for
this shift stems from the soccer
team's inability to score goals.
 __In four games so far, the soccer-
men have scored only eight times
to their opponents six while ‘out-
‘shooting them, 78 to 23. Bemis
"hopes this move will answer his
problem.

“Zortea has the heavy foot, he
"can keep a ball down and he'll
“score,” Bemis said. “Although
hisiniuryintheearlypartofthe
year has slowed him down, Aldo
‘feels his leg is okay. He's been
running on it without the use of

The old man was using the
