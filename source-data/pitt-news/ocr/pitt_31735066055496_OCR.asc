CWO, olhers rally for Roe v. Wade

By Anthony Breznican
Senior Staff Writer

‘A rally was held in the
Kurtzman Room of the William
Pitt Union last night. to com-
memorate the 23rd anniversary
of the Roe v. Wade Supreme
Court decision to legalize
abortion.

The event was sponsored by
women’s rights activists and
pro-choice advocates from
nearly 20 organizations,
including the University of
Pittsburgh’s Campus Women’s
Organization and activist
groups from Chatham College
and Carnegie Mellon
University. ,

Celebrating the anniversary
of the Supreme Court’s contro-
versial ruling was only one
reason for the rally, according
to Amy Sitnik, co-president of
the Campus Women’s
Organization. .

, Organizers of the rally also
hope to raise awareness and

opposition to proposed federal

legislation that would outlaw

late-term abortions.-
“Late-term abortions are

really only used when the

.woman’s life is in danger,” “

Sitnik said. “There are, on

average, only 600 done a year,
and about two doctors who do
them.” -

_Sitnik said that legislation
against that type of abortion
would ' increase risks to
women’s health.

“The procedure is not just a
woman aborting an unwanted
child,” Sitnik said. “Many
women want to keep the chil-
dren in [late-term abortion]
cases, but they want to save
their ownglives, or the child
has such severe deformities
that they will die within a few
months anyway.”

Lesley Albanese, also co-
president of CWO,_said she
was uncertain whether she
would support a woman with-
out pregnancy—induced health
problems who would choose to
have a late‘-term abortion.

“We’re not always saying
abortion is the way to go,”
Albanese said. “We’re only
saying a woman should have
the right to choose.”

from members of gay and les-
bian activist groups to the

Students find careers

By Isis Prior
For The Pitt News

What do you‘ want to be
when you grow up? This is a

phrase that most college stu- .
» dents loathe because they don’t

know. Yet they are under
tremendous pressure to choose
a major and finally a career.
The" problem is that the majori-
ty don’t know how. ‘ .

The solution to the confusio
can be found on campus. It is
called the Career Explorer
Group. The Career Explorer
Group is a series of structured
workshops offered through the
Counseling Center that meet for
three 90-minute sessions.

The program is designed to
give students a framework for

-making educated career choic-

es. I
“[The Explorer Groups] were
created to provide a model for
career decision-making with the
understanding that students
have never been instructed

about how to make career
said Tara Noone,

,9

choices,
graduate student and instructor
of Explorer Group workshops.
The program was designed
10 years ago by Marti Moore,
coordinator of career counsel-
ing at the Counseling Center,
with the help of a past graduate
student named Jay
Brandenberger. Using many
different resources, Moore and

said.

Brandenberger managed to
come up with a program that
they felt best met the needs of
Pitt students, and the program is
constantly being improved to
meet’ the changing needs of
those students. . - _
“People need to be constantly
in training and see themselves
as students always,” Moore
The Explorer Groups are not
workshops where -students are
told that a career in medicine is
right for them. On the contrary,
Explorer Groups are workshops
which teach students to look at
themselves and their own needs
and skills and make decisions
based on that. It also gives them
the tools to finding out career
information on their own. .

“[The idea is to] know that it 8

is a process and to deﬂate the
idea that you only get one shot

[at making a decision],” Noone.

said.

Each Explorer Group is run
by a variety of different people,
most often graduate students

. working in the advising center.
But no matter who guides the ’

sessions, the format is the same.

The basic framework of the
sessions is to teach the four
steps of the process of career
development, help students
evaluate values and skills, how
to get career information and
taking the strong interest test.

Phone in your taxes

By Joe Wright’
News Editor

' Taxes may be inevitable, but

_ for certain qualified students,
‘tax forms may not be any-

more.
A new IRS plan in effect this
year will allow many taxpay-
ers who have used 1040-EZ
forms in the past to ﬁle their
income tax return over the
phone. The system, known as
TeleFile, allows ﬁlers to make

a toll-free call from a touch-
tone phone, and then use their
phones to input tax informa-
tion.

, f‘Filing taxes doesn’t get any
easier than this,” said IRS
Margaret
Milner,- announcing the pro-

‘ gram. “TeleFile will not only

save taxpayers time and trou-
ble, but will also make the IRS
more efficient.” _

Taxpayers wishing to use
TeleFile must meet five crite-
ria: 8

- They must be single with-
out dependents;

0 They must have taxable
income of less than $50,000;

0 They must have filed a
1040-EZ form in previous
years;

, 0 They must live at the same

address as last year;
0 They must have received
TeleFile information in the

federal tax booklet mailed to
their home. ‘
According A to
DeSimone of the August,
Lang & Husak public relations

firm, college students are one

of the major targets of
TeleFile, as many students
meet the above criteria. ‘

TeleFile should make ﬁling
easier because it takes the
fi~ler'_’s tax information and
automatically calculates his or

her refund or amount of tax-
due. It is also the fastest way to '

process returns and expedite

refund checks, which should

be received within 21 days.

Callers to TeleFile are asked
to input a personal identifica-
tion number that can be found
in their tax booklet. The PIN
numbers and callers’ social
security numbers serve as fil-
ers’ signatures and are used for
identification should filers
have later questions.

The entire process of ﬁling
through TeleFi1e- takes about
l0 minutes. The TeleFile line
is open seven days a week, 24
hours a day, and callers can
choose English or Spanish
instructions. ,

IRS tax forms and publica-
tions are also availablevia the
Internet and on the World
Wide Web at

Same sex marriages

A wedding with two husbands.

A marriage ceremony with two wives.

In the near future, this might be regular work for a clergyman
in Hawaii. as gay marriages are quickly becoming a reality in
the Aloha State, and they might be here in Pennsylvania soon as
well.

According to the Associated Press, the reluctant Hawaii
Legislature is considering legalizing gay marriages, thus granti-
ng them the same social, legal and financial benefits as hetero-
sexual couples receive.

It’s about time.

Why should a state government care if a man wants to marry
a man or woman wants to marry a woman? It’s discrimination at
its finest.

This situation is a hot topic right here in our own backyard.
Last week we reported on Deborah Henson, a Pitt instructor
who has filed suit with the university because ‘her homosexual
lover has been denied health care benefits. Heterosexual couples

« do not receive health benefits either — unless they are married.

Henson argues this is discriminatory because homosexual cou-
ples do not have the option to marry. We agree.

A married couple is a married couple, no matter if it’s homo-
sexual or heterosexual. Benefits given to one couple should be

p given to all couples.

Fill the Field House

The 6,798 seats at Fitzgerald Field House will be ready tonight.

' They will be ready for ESPN2 and a national television audi-

ence. They will be ready for the undefeated, No.1-ranked
University of Massachusetts Minutemen.
They just need to be filled with people. So get out there and

4 support the Pitt Panthers.

_Everyone’s favorite coach, Paul Evans, always made a big

. deal about crowdsupport. And while he knew next to nothing

about basketball, he knew-what he was talking about when it
came to the Field House Fanatics.

He even gave credit to the Pitt faithful, calling them the indis-
pensable sixth man when the Panthers beat the No. 3 Oklahoma
Sooners six years ago. . » 6 ,

And the Sooners game was just one of many memorable ones.

4 Who can forget freshman Garrick Thomas, Seton Hall and a last

second three-pointer? .

Ralph Willard,‘ Pitt’s current head coach, knows the impor-
tance of a home crowd. He urged Pitt students who attended
Midnight Madness to come out in full force this year to support
the Panthers. ‘

If you’ve never been to a Pitt Panther game at the Fitzgerald

‘Field House against a ranked opponent, make sure you go

tonight.

Letters to the editor

h b’ ° ff
T e ‘lg npo

I’m writing this after
returning from the bookstore
with 18 books having a total
cash value of $147.50. This
was for only three _of my six
classes, and,.in fact, I did not
purchase all the books
required..My story is not an
uncommon one. l’ve often
heard of people buying indi-
vidual books for upwards of
$70, only to be told at the
end of the semester that they
cannot sell it back because
it’s an older edition (mean-
ing the publisher has"
changed two commas into
semi-colons). Even when the
bookstore does buy back
books, it is at a minute frac-
tion of the price.

As I said, my story is not
uncommon. Most students
on campus have had similar
experiences. I fear, in fact,
that it is the very commonal-
ity of this occurrence that
leads to students being com-
placent about the issue. How
many students have parents
who either buy the books for
them or at least pay their
rent and food bills so what-
ever money students make
can be applied to the pur-
chase of required texts?
However, I am notone of
those students. My class
schedule keeps me from get-
ting a decent paying job, so I
am employed by the univer-
sity at $4.90 an hour where I
can be scheduled for a maxi-
mum of 20 hours a week.
Therefore it will take me
almost two weeks (assuming
I spend moneyon nothing
else like food or rent) to pay
for these books, although the
financial state I am, in keeps
me in the lowest rent house I
could find, eating only one
meal a day. The very univer-
sity that keeps my wages so
low requires me to spend an
outrageous amount of them
buying books that usually

are not needed. The book-
store knows that it has a cap-
tive market, and until stu-
dents do something aside
from mutter as they hand
over their charge cards, the
practice will stay the same.

I for one cannot afford,
like so many other students,
to simply grin and bear it. I
am requesting that the school
set up a board comprised of
students along with faculty
members to regulate how
much professors can require
their students to spend on
textbooks. In addition‘, I am
asking the university to
release a list of all the texts
that will be required in the
upcoming semester to every
bookstore in the city so an
environment of "competition
will be fostered and the eco-
nomic exploitation of stu-
dents will (hopefully) cease.
Any student wishing to may
visit my web ‘page at
http://info.pitt.edu/~drgst21/
booklist to sign a petition to
the university regarding
these requests. While you are
there, you can look through
(or place) the free online ads
from other students selling
textbooks and cut out the
gouging middleman.

"Promised .

land?"

The January 16 edition of
The Pitt News contained an
article by Mr. Rick Nowlin,
entitled “Do We Deserve a
King Holiday.” While I
appreciate Nowlin’s overall
idea that there’s no use of
having a King holiday if no
one commits to the ideas that
he died for, I cannot appreci-
ate his suggestion that the

‘Promised Land has been

reached.
Have we really reached a

Promised Land? Is the

entrance to it decorated with
all of the rules and regula-
tions — prerequisites — that
Mr. Nowlin has pointed out?
Do we deserve to call
America 1996 a promised
land? '

Rick points out that the
“Promised Land is more a
state of mind.” If that’s true,
what was King preaching
about when he fervently
declared on the eveof his

. murder that “I might not get

there with ya  but we as a
people will get to the
Promised Land!” .

Also, Rick talks about the
God-like love of Dr. King.
But did King preach “1ove
thy enemy” exclusively? I
think not! A
, If my memory serves me
correctly, it was King that
declared in 1963 that “justice
[should] roll down like water
and righteousness like.a

fans do it. Neil O’Donnell
throws the pigskin with
such blazing speed, I don’t

Idon’t know how Steeler

. know how. fans of the black

and gold can see the ball.

And when Bam Morris bolts
through a hole and scurries
down the left sideline, I don’t
know how the ‘legions of
Steeler supporters watching
on TV ever_ keep up with the
action.

If this’ bothers you as much
as me, look no further because
the answer has arrived.

NBC Television has intro-
duced the electronic football,

or Globall, and it will debut.

on Super Bowl Sunday when
the Steelers take on the Dallas
Cowboys.

This is how it works. There
is a miniscule computer built
into the official NFL football
and it has a tinybulb that
lights up, so the billions" of
people in TV land can s-ee
exactly where the ball is
going.

The ball will burn a ﬂuores-
cent pink, because the inven-

tor of this product —— a former‘

employee of Fox Television
named Joe P. Moron — said
that his research found that
ﬂuorescent pink is the favorite
color of football fans.

And because we all know
that some players are faster
than others, the computer"
inside the ball is programmed
to show a bright green streak
of light on the TV screen any-
time someone is running at a
pace of 4.5 seconds per 40
yards or faster. ,

The only bad thing about
the Globall is that it wasn’t
thought of sooner. The mar-
keting possibilities behind this
ingenious invention are end-
less. ' V

.Sports are dominated by
speed today. Randy Johnson
can throw a baseball 100 mph,
Pete Sampras can serve a ten-
nis ball 120 mph John Daly
can drive a golf ball 135 mph
and Jeff Gordon can drive a
car 300 mph. _

The Pitt wrestling team
faced the nation’s elite last
weekend at the National
Duals in Nebraska. The
Panthers went into the meet
ranked 21st in the country
and came out with a 1-2
record for the weekend, but
proved that they can wrestle
with the top teams in the
country.

In the first round, Pitt
faced fourth—ranked
Michigan State. After
falling to an early 9-0
deficit, the Panthers fought
back, but it was too little,
too late and Michigan came
away with a 19-15 win.
Competing in his first
match in two weeks, 134-
pounder John Richey
defeated Jed Kramer by a
score of 3-2. At 190-
pounds, Mark Bodo, ranked
sixth in the nation at his
weight class, defeated
Michigan’s fifth-ranked
Brian Picklo, 7-5.

Pitt then faced West
Virginia, and this time it
was Pitt who held the early
advantage. The Panthers

Last Saturday’s track meet
at Kent State University
brought out a philosophical
streak, and perhaps a little bit
of vindication, in Pitt Head
Coach Steve Lewis.

“Contrary to the beliefs of
many, we’ve concerned our-
selves with building a track
team that concentrates on
every event from the 10,000
meters to the long jump and
everything in between,”
Lewis said. “We saw glimpses
of that at the Kent
Invitational.” '

As usual, there were a num-
ber of Pitt athletes who turned
in good performances, but, for

‘a change, not all of them were
sprinters or jumpers.

“That was not by design,”
Lewis said. “The team is
starting to do well in all
areas.”.

The middle distance and
distance events were the most
obvious areas of improve-
ment. Four men ,— Ed
Adamson, Scott Curry, Rich
Walsh and Julio Ortiz —
placed in the top 10 in the 800
meters. All of them were
under two minutes, and Scott
Gilpin, who finished 13th,
missed breaking that barrier
by a mere 29 seconds.

In the 3,000 meters, Pitt’s
Matt Samuel.(15:35.75) and
Dennis Kuntz (l5:42.88) fin-
ished third and fourth.

The highlight in women’s

°C0lum'1; Page 6 I distance events was the 5,000

pins by Richey and Mike
Ziska at 126-pounds. Pitt
lost four consecutive weight
classes, from 150 up to 177,
an area that caused prob-
lems for Pitt all day. The
score was tied at 15 going

into the last two matches,‘

but Bodo and heavyweight
Pat Wiltanger, both of
whom were a perfect 3-0 at
the meet, won their matches
to give Pitt a 22-15 victory.

The middle weight classes
gave Pitt problems again
when they faced No. 8
Arizona, State. At 142
pounds, J.J. Fasnacht, who
also went ,3-0 at the meet,
won a 3-2 decision. Arizona
then had one team point
deducted for unsportsman-
like conduct to make the
team score 6-5 in favor of
Pitt. The Panthers proceed-
ed to once again. drop the
next four weight classes,
falling behind 18-6. Bodo
and Wiltanger both won by
decision, but this time it
was not enough to make up
the difference, and Pitt lost
18-12.

The team, still traveling
home after the two-day
event, was unavailable for
comment.‘

Track stays on course

meters. Stephanie Ellsworth
won the event in 18:28.02,

and teammate Stacey
Anderson was sixth in
19:33.00.

' But hurdles and sprints are
the staples of Pitt’s track pro-

‘ gram, and that fact was still

clear Saturday. Jerel Williams
and Orrel Green were second
in the 55 meters and the 55-
meter hurdles, respectively. In
the women’s 55 hurdles, Pitt’s

Jennifer Williams, Najuma

Fletcher, Tonya Mullins and
Shana Fadis finished third
through sixth, respectively.
Pitt entered -two teams in
the women’s 4 x 400 meter
relay teams, and they both
qualified for the ECAC cham-
pionships. The A team fin-
ished first, and its stiffest
competition’ was from the B
team, which finished third.
Looking at the meet from
another angle, Lewis had
nothing but high praise for his
freshman class, led by Trecia
Smith. ,
Smith suffered a quad strain
in the first meet of the season,
also held at Kent State, and
had not competed since.
Smith came in second place
in the pentathlon with 3,543
points, just two points behind
Virginia Tech’s Katie
Ollendick. Smith also won the
triple jump easily at the meet,
with a jump of 40-3 1/4. In
second place was Pitt’s
Jennifer Washington, with 37-
8 1/2. Lewis was impressed

with Smith's rformances.

Men's swim beat
PSU, women lose

By Matt Townsend
Staﬁ Writer

The home stretch of the swimming season is now upon the
men’s and women’s teams. The meets between now and the ’
last weekend in February are just warm-ups for the Big. East
Championships. _

“We like to win dual meets, so we have a good overall
record, but we look ahead to the end of the season,”_ said
women’s Coach Marian Cassidy Keen. “We have been prepar- .
ing for the championships since September.” ' t

The teams traveled to Penn State last Saturday where the
men slithered out a 123-120 win over host Penn State and the
women were easily beaten 182-111.

“Penn State put a lot of pressure on themselves to win this
meet,” said men’s Coach Chuck Knoles. “The meet was adver-
tised as ‘Come see the Lions beat the 25th-ranked Panthers,’
inferring that we didn’t deserve our rating. We needed to win to '
validate our ranking and we did.” . '

As of Jan. 6, the men have been ranked 25th, by the College
Swimming Coaches Association Poll.

With this win the men improved to 7-1, with three straight *
victories. After five" events, Pitt trailed by one, 47-46. But a
one-two finish in the one-meter dive by John Soulakis (300.75) .
and Jeremy McClean (278.62) put Pitt in the lead 60-52.

Pitt fell behind two events later, 76-74, and again one event
after losing the lead, Pitt gained it back. This time it was a first
and third finish in the 200 backstroke by Eric Stefanski
(l:50.31) and Adam Kotkiewicz (l:52.78).

Soulakis and McClean dominated again in the three-meter I
dive ﬁnishing ﬁrst and third with scores of 309.9 and 274.8
respectively. Their places increased the lead from two to 11, a
deﬁcit that Penn State could not recover. Soulakis was a double
winner in the two diving events for the second meet in a
row.

“John has been a steady competitor all season,” said Knoles.

The meet was clinched in the second "to last event, the 200
breastroke. Hakan Kiper, a recent transfer from Turkey,
touched out a PSU swimmer for ﬁrst (2:07 .38) and Chris Pen'y

I followed to come in third with 2:07.81.

“The team did a complete tum-around from the West

They can add the Globall, but that’s not
enough. Tennis is a sport with very few person-
alties, so they’ll have to do better than that.

What they need to do is put a computer inside
the strings of the rackets, which is connected to
the base of the racket, which is connected to the
player’s body. Every time the ball hits the rack-

This way tennis enthusiasts will have no trou-
ble following the action. Now if only the peo-
ple who run my favorite sport, hockey, could
see what they’re missing.

They need the Globall, or Glopuck. Maybe
they could put a blue light in it and have it light
up a streak of red every time someone shoots it
over 70 mph.

the East behind Najuma

All in all, Smith qualified
for the ECAC championships
in the triple jump, the pen-
tathlon and the shotput on the
day.

Two Pitt freshmen finished
in the top four in the women’s
400 meters. ' Naeemah Withey
was second in 58.76 seconds.
Less than a second behind her
was Nina Carter (59.57) in
fourth place.

In both the men’s and
women’s 800»meters, fresh-
men did well. Tamika Dorin
was sixth for the women and
Julio Ortiz had a personal
best time of 1:58.26 en route
to his eighth place finish.

“The freshmen are starting
to mature,’_’ Lewis said.
“They’re making serious con-
tributions to the betterment of
the teams.”

Virginia meet,” said Knoles.
“Against WVU we won, but it
was ugly. We looked tired and
slow. Then we came into Penn
State and beat an undefeated
team and that was fun.”

The women lost to 23rd-
ranked Penn State 182-111 in a
meet in which Pitt was outscored
in every event except two. '

The women were also coming
off a tough meet in which they
didn’t swim well and lost to
West Virginia by ﬁve, 124-1 19.

“The thing that I was most
pleased with is that they came
off a tough loss and swam well,”
said Keen. “This is the ‘kind of
competition that gives us good
experience and will help us pre-
pare for the Big E ast.” '

Standouts for the ladies were
Jill Fletcher’s season-best
1:06.39 in the 100 breaststroke.
Irene Sturgis placed second in
both the 100 free (53.64) and
200 butterfly (2208.73), and
Sunday Lewandowski was a
double winner in the one- and
thnee-meter diving events.
