Tuition hikes for state-related
universities are a certainty, but the
amount of the increases is a point of
contention between state and uni-
versity officials.

Pennsylvania higher education

. commissioner James Gallagher said

last week that the 2 percent funding
increases proposed by Governor
Thornburgh could enable state uni-
versities to hold tuiton increases to 5
percent.

This statement was refuted by Pitt
chancellor Wesley Posvar, who said,
‘‘I think it’s very unfortunate that
Mr. Gallagher chose to second guess

the budget process of the university-

He has no knowledge of our budgets
at all.”

Pitt requested an increase of 10
percent in state funding, which was
not approved. Students will have to

make up this difference by shoulder-
ing high tuition increases in the fall.

Posvar said, "The chance of get-
ting an additional, say, 5 million
over what the governor proposed is
almost negligible. But we will try;
there is always a chance of getting a
slight increase.”

The state Department of Educa-
tion proposes to keep tuition
increases at 5 percent, mostly by
eliminating salary increases for.
faculty at state schools._

“They are taking the position of
little or no salary increases for state
employees, including state college
faculty and, therefore, they would be
much more comfortable in that
tough position if the state-related
universities froze faculty salaries,”
Posvar said.‘

Posvar said he is reluctant to see a
tuition increase go above 5 percent

but is in favor of seeing modest
salary increases. He. explained that
the state's position on these
increases is “completely acceptable”
in light of today's inflation.

Gallagher said in his statement,
“When you make a budget presenta-
tion, you want to get the maximum
amount of dollars. 1 cannot be criti-
cal of an aggressive, talented univer-
sity official applying that kind of’
pressure." .

Posvar replied, “I think that was a

, very unfair statement. The presenta-

tions made by universities were
sincere.

“I know the Penn State budget
situation; I talked to President

Oswald yesterday. Their situation is
very similar to ours. If we receive

practically no increase from the state '

and tuition is held at 5 percent,
there's no money. There would be no
money left at all for anything else."

lt’s not exactly a spinoff ofthe
Oil Price Wars, and it’s slightly
more heated than the Cold War.
Around these parts, it’s being
called the Pizza War. In short, it
takes less dough to buy pizza
these days—-Oakland shops are
practically giving the Italian
delight away.

A large pizza at Little Italy is
on sale for $3.77, at Napoli‘s for
$3.50 and at Capri’s for $3. These
figures, of course, do not include
extras. I

“Pizza War? What Pizza
War?“ asked the manager of
Capri’s with a big smile. A series
of chuckles followed from
employees within listening dis-
tance. The manager requested
- her name be withheld.

“We lowered the prices to give
students a break,” she said. “We
don‘t call it a pizza war . . . we
prefer to call it a spring special.
With all the fast food restaurants
around here, we have to A do

Pizza Battles Mushrooming

something to get people to talk
about us.”

The spring special has lasted
all winter. No mushrooming pri-
ces here, for pizza has carved a
thin path around the outskirts of
a weak economy. It has become
the cheapest dinner available to
Pitt students. Once something of
a luxury, pizza is now turning the
TV dinner business upside down.
At leastit is on the Pitt campus.
Competition is doing wonders.

That may end shortly. Secret
meetings aimed J at returning
pizza to its former price are tak-
ing place behind closed doors.
Shop owners are looking for a
greater profit.

“We lowered the prices
because of the tough competi-
tion,” said Tom Vairo, the man-
ager at Napoli’s. But the specials
will end soon. “We are going

back to the old prices because

right now it’s not worth it for us

to stay open. There's not too

much in the way of profit.”
“Yes, it's a war between us,”

Vairo added. “But we’ve talked
with them, and soon we'll set a
price. lt’s just not working the
way we have it—-we’ve all said
that.”

Mark Latvala, owner of
Dominoes Pizza, doesn’t see the
pizza business tumbling down.
In fact, his establishment is one
of the few in Oakland to keep its
prices constant. At a time when
other shops werejointly lowering
prices, Dominoes’ have
remained the same.

“The major difference we’ve
made is to change managers,"
Latvala said. It was a problem
that affected the quality of pizza
and the service that we offered.

“We've helped ourselves more
by making that change than we
would have by offering price dis-
counts," Latvala added. “If we
do our job right, if we put out a
quality pizza and offer good ser-
vice, we’ll sell pizzas. We were
hurt by our own mistakes, not by

corztinued on page two

u.

Posvar added that the university
has made cuts in all areas and is

continuing to do so in an effortltok 3

keep costs down.

“It's a matter of trying to do the
best we" can for the students, the
faculty and staff,”
commented.

The chancellor explained that a
lot of discussion will take place on
these points of conﬂict before the
governor's budget comes out in
May. At that time, the university
will know how much'money is com-
ing out of the state and will be able to
determine the extent of possible tui-
tion hikes. '

Posvar explained that there are a
host of uncertainties at the present
time. Coupled with the state of the
economy and problems with the
state budget, the university will be
forced to make some very difﬁcul
decisions. l

Board

Passes

Budgets

By PAUL CORREA —

I

The Student Government Board
(SGB) passed the budgets of 23 stu-
dent organizations and rejected 2 in
last week’s meeting. Pitt Men’s Glee
Club and Quo Vadis had their
budgets rejected.

Quo Vadis, whose members are
the tour guides for the Nationality
Rooms, requested $1,350 for a bus
and $700 for lodging fora “Toronto,
Canada Excursion.” The Alloca-
tions Committee recommended that
this trip not be funded. According to
Quo Vadis spokesman, “This trip is
vital—it is where themembers of
Quo Vadis can view other tour-
giving techniques.” She added that
by viewing other tour guides, we can
improve our own style. The spokes-
man said, “Toronto is an interna-
tional city in a foreign country, and
we would be taking many tours
where we would have the opportun-
ity to see other tour guides’ tech-
niques and we would be able to
criticize and analyze their technique
in order to better our own
technique.” .

James Shelton, chairperson of the

Allocations Committee, said that he-~

didn't think it was necessary to take
the whole organization to Toronto.
Shelton asked, “Can you send a few
members and have them bring back
information?” -

The Quo Vadis spokesman said,
“I don’t think so, it is something we
should all experience."

The vote on the Quo Vadis budget
was a tie. SGB president Mark
Downs voted to break thetie and
send the budget back to the Alloca-
tions Committee for recon-
sideration.

Pitt Men's Glee Club requested
$1,000 for two workshops—one in
the fall and one in the spring. The
Allocations Committee recom-
mended funding one workshop. ’

Allocations chairperson James
Shelton said, “We looked at this the
same way we look at the SGB
retreat——that one is sufficient.”

According to a Glee Club spokes-
man, the workshops are necessary to
prepare for the annual fall and
spring concerts by the Glee Club.
The spokesman said, “It is very

contmued on page five

competition.”

Joe Lazzaro, an assistant man-

ager at Little Italy, said that the
situation will change once the ,
current school term ends. The

price of a large pizza will then be
returned to $5. Indeed, a luxury
for most students.

“Before,” Lazzaro said, “eve-
ryone wanted to get ahead. Now,
everyone is getting together. Eve-
ryone is looking at everyone else
to see what to do.

“It’s competition,” Lazzaro
added. “But we’re going to put it
back together the way it was
originally.”

It seems that pizza-shop
owners are joining forces to put
the squeeze on consumers. After
all parties had split for a while,
they are reuniting after observing
a lessening of their powers. The
old concept of workingtogether
has apparently been reinstated.

“What, they do, we do,” Laz-
zaro said. “How can we keep our
price at $5 when everyone else
has his at $3? We have to keep
with the competition.”

The manager of Capri’s agreed

\ that, despite her turning her head
at the Pizza War theory. Since
everyone else will raise prices . . .
not need to separate from the
crowd now. The pizza shop
owners are sticking together, so

it seems.

“Raise prices? Why not?” she
asked. “If they raise theirs, we'll
raise ours, too. Ever since
December, they’ve done nothing
but lower prices. We’ve had to
lower ours to meet the
competition.

“But it’s not business-like to
keep lowering prices. If it’s com-
petition they want, we can com-
pete with any of them. We think
it’s fun. If that’s the way they
want to act, that's fine with us.
We are a chain; we have other
shops. We can go on forever.”

And so may the Pizza Wars.

Fraternity Runs Into Zoning Problems

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Efforts by the Triangle fraternity
to obtain an occupancy permit for
their house on North Bellefield St.
have raised some issues about
Greeks on the Pitt campus once
again.

Members of Triangle, Pitt’s engi-
neering fraternity, appeared before

— the city’s Zoning Board of Adjust-

ment to file for an occupancy permit
two weeks ago.

Because a law was recently
enacted requiring fraternity houses
to be within 300 feet ofa classroom,
they were denied a permit but given
an extension to file again.

Two residents of North Bellefield

also appeared before the Zoning
Board in regard to Triangle’s
request-—protesting that fraternities

.are disrupting forces in Oakland

neighborhoods.

“They complained about fraterni-
ties in general, but the complaints
were not really directed toward us,”
said Jeff Tatarzyn, president of'Tri-
angle. “They looked at the fraternity
system as a whole. We took the
brunt ‘ of the fraternity ‘Animal
House’ image."

The law requiring fraternities to

be located within 300 feet ofa class- .>

room was instated in 1979. Three
other fraternities on North
Bellefie1d—Pi Kappa Alpha, Delta
Phi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon—were
exempt from thisvruling, having

been built prior to 1979.

“All the fraternities that had
houses on the block were able to
keep them,” Tatarzyn said.

“No one had ever bothered to tell
t_hem that they needed an occupancy
permit,” said Lou McLinden, advi-
sor to the lnterfraternity Council. “I

.think that’s where the problem

arises.”

Triangle’s deadline for the exten-
sion to file for a permit is up this
week, and members of the fraternity
are optimistic about the outcome of
their efforts this time.

According to Jim Bibel, a member
of Triangle, one of their alumni has
kept a written record ofthe improve-
ments the fraternity, has been mak-
ing to thehouse, and that will be

used as evidence before the Zoning
Board.

“I think there’s a good chance that

we will get theipermit," Tatarzyn
said.

The house currently holds nine of .
Triangle‘s 23 members, as well as

two independents.

McLinden does not see com- /1

plaints from the nieghbors as a
major obstacle in obtaining the
permit.

“Triangle is an engineering frater-
nity," he said. “lt’s not that large ofa
house. They’re all highly scholastic
in that house. I'm not sure what the
neighbors complained about there."

“To tell you the truth," Tatarzyn
said, “there's no problem with the
neighbors.”

Engineers who enrolled in
school four years ago with expec-
tations of receiving countlessjob
offers upon graduation may be in
for a big surprise. A recent col-
lege placement survey showed
that job offers, which were once
plentiful, are now sharply on the
decline. ,

The survey also said that 12
percent fewer entry-level _posi-
tions will be available in 1982-83

-than in 1981-82.

The biggest decline will be in
the civil, petroleum and agricul-
tural engineering fields, while
mechanical and computer engi-
neering will_ show less of a
decrease.

important for the club to go on these
workshops away from school
because there are too many distrac-
tions on campus.”

She1ton’s response was “in other
words it should be the role of the

SGB to finance your organization.

because your organization is not dis-
ciplined enough to practice on its
own during the week."

The Glee Club spokesman said
this was not the case.

The vote on the Glee Club budget
resulted in a tie. Since not enough
board members voted to either reject
the budget or approve it, the budget
automatically goes back to the Allo-
cations Committee for reconsider-
ation.

The Campus Crusade for Christ

(CCC) budget was approved, but
only after a lengthy discussion by the
board, the Allocations Committee
and the SGB. The discussion cen-
tered on whether to send 40 people
to a conference in Kansas City, Mis-
souri. The Allocations Committee
recommended that 4 people be sent.
According to Shelton, the Alloca-
tions Committee has a policy of only
sending four people to conferences.
He added that if the the SGB felt
that this policy was inadequate, it
was up to them to change it.

According to the CCC spokes-
man, this is a very important confer-
ence. The CCC spokesman said,
“We put such a high priority on this
program that we are willing to take
money out from other programs in
order to go." The conference will
attract at least 25,000 people accord-
ing to the spokesman.

Board member Kathy Brown sup-
ported the CCC in its attempt to
send 40 people to Kansas City.
Brown said, “This is a unique pro-
gram in that this type of charismatic
conference is the very essence of this
organization, and every member of
this organization will benefit
immensely from this program.”

Board member Barry Greene said,
“This seems like a religious pro-
gram." Greene added that the SGB
is not allowed to fund religious
programming.

Brown said that there are excep-
tions to every policy. Brown said,
“This type of conference is different
in that the information the individ-

— ual will be obtaining will be spirit-

ual. I don’t think spirituality can be
brought back from this conference,
each individual has to experience it
himself. Therefore, I am in favor of
rejecting the Allocations
recommendation.”

Shelton said, “Then you have to
change the policy. The SGB must be
consistent in its decisions. I also
must say that you should have
approved a bus for the Italian Club

Starting
Salaries
Measley

Journalism is not as glamour-
ous a profession as it seems in
print. A recent report found that
the average starting salary for
graduates of a prestigious jour-
nalism school was only $10,000.
The measly startin salaries do
not, however, inhi it competi-
tion. The report estimates that
there are three to four applicants
for every opening.

Scholarship
Offered

Simple  
Math

It doesn’t add up. Pitt predicts that its operating
costs in 1984 will require a revenue increase totalling
15 percent from state funding and tuition combined.
That increase would be ﬁve times the current inﬂation
rate. Where is the money going?

Pitt receives about $2100 per student each year from
the state government. Instate undergraduates tuition
(not including housing or food) for one year is about
the same. _ 

Pitt makes money in other ways, as well, including
revenue from sports teams, gifts from individuals and
_corporations and income from research contracts with
government or private concerns. But much~of this
money is “earmarked” for use in specific projects, like
new construction or research. The bulk of the money
for teaching programs comes from tuition and state
funding. ’

\ Governor Thornburgh has proposed increasing A

Pitt’s appropriation by only about 2 percent above last
year’s level. Inflation last year ran at about 4 percent
and is projected to be the same or lower in 1984.

Since government and tuition make up roughly
equal parts of Pitt’s general budget, a 1 percent short-
fall in one source can be made up by increasing
revenue from the other by 1 percent. So, if 1984 infla-
tion is 4 percent, the state’s 2 percent increase will fall
short of Pitt’s needs by 2 percent. To regain all of that
shortfall through a tuition increase, Pitt would have to
raise tuition by the 4 percent expected inﬂation rate
plus the 2 percent lost from the state for a total of 6
percent. .

Administrators from Pitt and other state-related
universities, however, have claimed that an increase in
tuition of up to l0 percent may be required if Thorn-
burgh’s proposal is adopted.

An increase of that size would give Pitt a larger
budget -in 1984 than in 1983; in other words, Pitt would
have to grow to use all of the money.

Is Pitt growing? Is the geography department larger
than it was last year? Is the internship office slated for
expansion——or the athletic department? No. Pitt is
shrinking, at least in terms of teaching and student
programs in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Where is all the money going?

Letters To The Editor

A Pointless Controversy

Dear Editor:

I would like to thank Carmen
Furfa’ro for the letter about leaving
the abortion issue alone. Ten years
ago, the Supreme Court ruled that
women have the right to choose for
themselves and that’s just as it
should be. After all, this is a free
country and a woman’s body and
destiny are her own. There are many
reasons why women have abortions,
it’s not just a “convenient” method
of contraception at all. I can tell you
that by personal experience.

Last year, I became pregnant. It

was a big decision to make—what to
do about this—and one that cer-
tainly was not taken lightly by either
my boyfriend or myself. I realized
that if I had the baby, both my boy-
friend and I would have to quit col-
lege and work, that is if we could
find jobs. My parents would proba-
bly throw me out of the house, and
where and how could we raise a
child? We have nothing to offer a
child at this point.

The decision made, I had the
abortion. It cost a lot of money and a
lot of pain, but I’ll never regret our

choice. I think going through the
ordeal together brought us even
closer, and if we ever do get married
in the future, we are going to have
children. I love them as much as
anyone else.

I hope the pro-life group will see
that it is pointless to carry this issue
on any further. Women should have
the right to choose what’s right... for
them.

Frustration And Panic

Dear Editor:

As graduation nears and my
career at Pitt both as an athlete and
an undergraduate student closes, I
would like. to express my gratitude
to all of the faculty members who
have been supportive and under-
standing. It was sometimes difficult
to stay caught up with school work
while travelling for competition—as
most athletes will agree-—but when
given the opportunity to have”inake-
up exams or turn in work early, it
made everything a little easier.

Frustration, panic, and unneeded
tension and stress were ‘relieved by
those of you who took the time to
understand what I and many student
athletes as well as other students

Dear Editor:

Your timely and interesting article
on Pitt’s archives neglects mention
of the important fact that it exists at
all.

When I came to Pitt as assistant
director of the library in 1965, l was
appalled to discover that there was
no identifiable university archives.
Various important documents were
squirreled away all over the campus,
and as soon as it was practical to do
so, the head cataloger. with over 30
years of service to the university, was
dispatched to Denver for a course in
archive management and returned
to take up her duties with the inten-

.tion of establishing a separate

department of the library when it
moved to the new building.

Mrs. Wallace, who came back

‘Opinion

The Right
To Criticize

Dear Editor:

Thomas Daniels, in his letter “Crude and
Tragic Errors,” accuses me of “entrapping
him in a tyranny of subjective reality." I do

not for a moment doubt that Mr.’ Daniels is '

indeed cntrapped—first by his own bigotry
and second by the facts which are clearly
against him.

It is incomprehensible how any individual
with even the most rudimentary knowledge
of the Middle East could deny that the.Arabs
ever attacked Israel. Yet this is precisely
what Daniels attempts to do.

He said, “To the charge that Arab states
attacked Israel, I see this to be rather to the
contrary.” I

The Arab states are themselves proud of
the fact that they attacked Israel on numer-
ous occasions with the stated intention of
“driving the Jews into the sea.” One has only
to open any book on the Middle East to
verify this fact. These same facts can be read

in any of the Arab papers published during

or preceeding the wars.

Further, I do not understand Daniels
when he states, “What better way to criticize
other peoples’ enterprises than to use the
way they refer to themselves and their
actions.” Is he referring to his statement con-
cerning the “Jews" will towards excessive
wealth and profit" or to his statement con-
cerning the Zionists, whom he calls
“Wealthy—greedy by nature?”

I know very few Jews who refer‘to them-
selves in this way. His statement, “I know
Jews who agree with the views expressed in
my letters to The Pitt News sounds remarka-
bly similar to “some of my best friends are
black.” _

As an American, Daniels has every right
to criticize the Camp David Accords, even to
bemoan them on the basis that they “give a
shot in the arm to those who are pro-
Western." I only wish that Daniels would
not couch his opposition to the United
States and democracy in terms that are anti-
Israeli but would instead come right out and
say what he means. It would also help him to
remember that the right to criticize is not
extended to the peoples of the governments
which he supports.

We have yet to see a disclaimer by the
Progressive Student Network separating
themselves from Daniels‘ anti-semitic
remarks, but we have taken note of the fact
that he new signs his letter only as a CAS
student and not as a representative of Mobil-

ization for Survival (as he did on Sept. 22) or-
the Progressive Student Network (as he did
Feb. 4).

In closing, having seen Thomas Daniels’
blatant ignorance of even the most rudimen-
tary facts concerning the Middle East, it is
not surprising that he asks where Israel's
borders are. Her borders are clearly marked
by international law and encompass but 22
percent of what was Palestine.

Zachary Grayson
Director
Masada

Po|icyC|arified

Dear Editor:

Throughout this semester, there have
been a number of articles written‘ in The Pitt
News on the state of Israel. In one in particu-
lar, Zachary Grayson charged that Progres-
sive Student Network (PSN) member
Thomas Daniels was anti-Semitic, and
therefore, seeing no disclaimer to his view-

DebateOver Mid- East Issues Continues

point, the entire Progressive Student Net-
work was anti-Semitic (Pitt News Feb. 14,
I983). _ 7 \
As such, we find it necessary to clarif
PSN’s policy. First, though Mr. Daniels
charged that Israel was reaping economic

benefits from the occupation of Lebanon,‘

this is in no way to be interpreted as the
historic anti-Semitic argument of the “inter-
national Jewish-capitalist-banker conspira-
cy.” We would like to point out that every
nation-state in the world, today and in the
past, has been motivated by economics. For
instance, South Africa benefits through its
occupation of Nambia, as does the United
States through its control of Puerto Rico
and Britain through its domination of
Northern Ireland.

We do not accuse Israel or the Jewish
people of trying to “control the world‘s
wealth.” PSN simply recognizes that eco-
nomic wealth will be exploited by those in a
position to do so. Secondly, PSN believes
that Israel’s invasion of Lebanon was unjus-
tified, especially considering the levels of
violence and destruction. We believe that

Pitt’s administrators seem to delight in changing the names of the campus most
traditional edifices. They also seem to derive pleasure from homogenizing building
names. The most recent generic tag was given to our beloved Schenley Hall—-it will now
be known as Pitt Union (or, more aptly, P.U.).

In my view, we as students should have some input to the labels which will appear on
our course descriptions, campus maps and daily discussions.

So the next time the administrators go re-labelling crazy . . . here are a few suggesions:

problem in the Middle East be solved l

through the process of violence and
bloodshed.

Thirdly, we hold that the Palestinian peo-
ple have a right to self-determination and the
right to a homeland—not to be confused
with Jordan. And given that the United
Nations and the Palestinian people recog-
nize the P.L.O. as their sole legitimate repre-
sentative, we call upon all parties involved,
including the U.S. government, to negotiate
with them in finding a just and lasting peace.
It is painfully obvious that simply driving
the Palestinian people from one area to

"another will only serve to create a [scenario]

for continued suffering and violence for all
parties involved.

Apparently, Mr. Grayson and the other
unmentioned Jewish leaders fail to realize
that solutions practiced by extremists will

.‘ only serve to create more extremist solu-
tions. In doing so, Mr. Grayson and his

unknown supporters have reverted to label-
ing PSN ‘an anti-Semitic organization. By
using such negative and emotion-charged
rhetoric, he sought to influence people by
classifying PSN with delegitimizing
language. *

Because we disagree with the expansionis- I

, tic policies of Begin and supporters, does

that make us anti-Semitic? Are the members

of Peace Now, a group of Jews within Israel -

who oppose the occupation’ of Lebanon,
anti-Semitic? Is the person, or persons, who
tossed a hand grenade into a crowd of Peace
Now demonstrators anti-Semitic—
especially given that members of Rabbi
Kahanes sect are currently suspects? The
answer is No!

PSN will continue to criticize the situation .

in the Middle East, as is our right. And, as is
Mr. Grayson’s right, he too will continue to
comment. But we will also continue to take
offense at degrading, self-serving and inac-
curate labels which serve nothing but the
alienation of people.

May we suggest instead that our groups,
and any others who are interested, take part
in a constructive dialogue to achieve a basis
for rational and productive interchange in
the future. By doing so, we can work
towards setting a stage upon which a forum
of logical ideas may be voiced. Only through
sound reasoning, and not reﬂex attacks,
may moves toward peace be made.

An ad hoc committee on student
issues has been formed to address
the proposed tuition hike and other
pertinent issues affecting Pitt
students.

The temporary committeeis com-
posed of the Progressive Student
Network (PSN); the Governmental

0 Relations Committee; the president

of the College Youhg Democrats,
Chuck Pascal; and other concerned ,

The Pitt News, Monday March zé, 1983

According to Tom Wanko, con-
tinued cuts in student aid and servi-
ces at the federal, state and local
levels have jeopardized the ability to
obtain a quality education. The
committee's purpose is‘ to broaden
student organization represen-
tation.

The short term goals of the com-
mittee are:

GT0 obtain 5,000 signatures from
students and concerned faculty for a
‘petition to Pitt’s Board of Trustees
about the proposed tuition hike.

GT0 lobby the Board of Trustees
to maintain tuition at the 1982-83
rates. ~

0To present a resolution calling
for no additional cuts in the aca-
demic departments, the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences or service
workers.

GTO promote a greater inter-
changeof information between the
committee and concerned faculty.

Some of the long-term goals
include lobbying the state and fed-

, eral government officials to oppose

further cuts in student aid and servi-
ces, increasing funding to Pitt and
opposing further cuts in social
programs.

“These are just the beginning of
our potential goals,” Wanko said.
“We solicit every student organiza-
tion and student to get involved.
Every student organization has a
vested interest in taking part in the
committee and ensuring a quality
education in the future.”

According to Leslie Messineo of
the Governmental Relations Com-

mittee, “The committee and the tui-
tion freeze is a great idea because it’s
a chance for administrators to really
get a feeling for what students think
on an issue of vital concern."

Messineo hopes that every stu-
dent will take the opportunity to use
the committee as a forum for their
views.

Nancy Glick, a student in the
School of Social Work, said, “It is
important for students to get
involved and assume responsibilities
for their futures on issues that
directly affect them. .

‘Spring Switch

Flynn Given Nod At Quarterback; Fazio Pursues New Offense”

By scorr DELLETT

The purpose of spring football
is to find replacements for the
upcoming season. Sometimes,
experimenting takes place to fill
the holes left by graduation. For
Pitt head coach Foge Fazio,
there’ll be a lot of holes to patch.

The Panthers lost 13 starters
from last season’s team—
including quarterback Dan
Marino—three-fifths of the
offensive line, both linebackers
and half the secondary. Their
four-year record of 42-5 speaks
for itself.

No wonder Fazio has to
become a football chemist.
Along with the talent lost; Fazio
and the offensive coaching staff
must find an offense to suit the
personnel. A quarterback like
Marino only comes once a
decade.

One of Fazio’s experiments
involves safety Tom Flynn.
When spring practice started last
Friday, the 6-0, I85-lb. senior to
be has been shifted to

- quarterback.

With the lack of experienced
players returning——none of the
quarterbacks returning have let-
tered in their collegiate career,
and onlyjunior John Cummings
has thrown a pass in varsity
competition—putting an excel-
lent all-around athlete with good
football knowledge like Flynn
may work out.

But even though the quarter-
back situation may be muddled,

there‘s one thing for certain-
football fans will not see the
wide-open, sophisticated offense
they have witnessed the last three
years.

“We have strong quick ath-
letes who are able to throw,”
Fazio said of the candidates at
the quarterback position. “Tom
Flynn and Matt Daniels have
run a 4.6 [40-yard dash], while
Chris Jelic and John Congemi
run a 4.7 and Rich Bowen runs a
4.8.” "

Don’t expect to see a conver-
sion to a run-oriented offense
like the veer. “An option offense
takes on different forms,” Fazio
said. “We plan on throwing the
ball but more in a controlled
fashion.”

This is where Flynn comes in.
Even though he hasn’t played
quarterback since his high school
days at Penn Hills, he has shown
the pure skills to be successful.
After all, he was able to break the
starting safety spot for the No. 1
defense in the country as a fresh-
man in l980. '

“I am really excited about the
move,” Flynn said. “If I would
have stayed at free safety for the
spring, I would have been bored.
Last year, I only made one tackle
and broke up one pass. All I did
was run up and back.”

One thing that doesn’t concern.

Flynn is the loss of personal
goals due to the move. He would
have been considered an All-
America candidate at free safety
along with a possible draft choice

in the National Football League
in 1984. 4

“I’m not even thinking about
it,” he said.

Nor is he overly concerned
about the time away from the
quarterback position. During his
years at Penn Hills, the Indians
ran a limited offense due to the
huge offensive line and good run-

ning backs the team had. .

“In my senior year, I threw 10
passes, which was the most ever
thrown by a Penn Hills quarter-
back,” he said. “I completed
about 50 percent. of my passes."

He was recruited by smaller
schools such as Richmond but
decided he would rather play
defense on a nationally—known
school like‘Pitt. . ,

Another difference between
the 1982 team and ‘this year’s
should be the type ofleadership.

‘ With the high expectations and

tremendous talent, the leader-
ship was more low-key. The 1983
team may show the type oflead-
ership shown in 1981.

“Their’s was an unique type of
leadership last year,” Flynn said.
“But this year’s team may need a
different type of leadership.
We’re young and enthusiastic.

“We are going to take things

day by day and have fun.”

That was something missing
from last year’s team.

Swimmers Finishﬁespectably

By JAN UJEVICH

The Panther swim team had no

representatives at the NCAA Men’s
Swimming and Diving Champion-
ships this past weekend, but neither
swim coach Fred Lewis nor‘ diving
coach Julian Krug .were disap-
pointed with the l982-83 season.’
Among the accomplishments this

season. were a 7-2 dual meet record, 5
winning the Big East championships .

in the first year of competition and a
fourth-place finish in the Eastern
Regional Championships.

Junior Jeff Emore missed qualify-
ing for Nationals by seventh-tenths
of a second in the l00-yard butterfly
while both the medley and freestyle
relays also missed making National
standards.

“The team knows what potential
is there for next year; that is—[the
potential] not only to qualify for the
NCAAs but to place next year,"
Lewis said.

With their performances in the
Big East championships, it appeared
that the Panthers were ready for
both Easterns and Nationals.

“The men had a tremendous Big
East meet for being unshaved, and
we thought that we were set to make
NCAA time standards going into
Easterns," Lewis said. “But when we
confronted the flu and cold water in
the pool, it just didn’t allow for fast
enough times.”

At this time last year, the Panther
diving team looked weak, with only
one diver on the squad. But an excel-

deep,” Krug said. ,
Mark McCormick and John
Dusch made it to the NCAA pre-
qualifying meet, but failed to go any
further. In the Eastern Regionals,
McCormick, Dusch and Mike
McCalley had consistent scores in
the one- and three-meter boards.
“I feel extremely fortunate to have
been able to work with the quality of
divers that we’ve had this year,”
Krug said. “They are even now train-
ing and learning new dives: they’re
still hungry and eager to work hard.”
“I expect within these ranks right
now, a future All-America. I can
foresee Pitt’s diving being the pow-
erhouse in the East."
Lewis is currently going after

1

sprinters to replace Pete Doyle and
Jerry Zaleski while recruiting back-
stroke specialists to help Ed Bergan.

“I think this year will be our best
recruiting year since 1976 when we
brought in six high school All-
Americas,” Lewis said.

Returning next season will be Tri-

Captains Emore, John McCrillis,

and Ed Bahan. Along with breast-
stroke and distance freestyle special-
ists Don Martin and Greg Murphy,

Bergan and sophomore breaststroke ,

specialist Doug Condon will also
return;

Meanwhile, ﬁve divers will partic-
ipate in the United States Senior
National Prequals this upcoming

weekend, Apr. 1 and 2. '

 

lent freshman class impressed Krug
this season, and he expects better
things from them in the near future.
An example of their potential was
the performance in the Big East
championships, where six divers
scored in the Top l0 in both diving
events, contributing over I00 points

With the end of the term nearing,
there are some observations that this
writer must release:

The-Big East coaches did Clyde
Vaughan a great injustice by placing
him no higher than a third team All-
Conference player. This is a guy that

-led the Big East in scoring and was
third in rebounding. Vaughan, per-
haps more than any other player in

‘he conference, carried an entire
8

“am on his shoulders for mostof the
season. He was a 6-4 small forward
called upon to battle the giants
inside. In short, he had to perform
the tasks usually assigned to two or
three players. He was asked to do
more than perhaps any other player
in the conference. And he was suc-
cessful at just about every venture.

Final4..

The Pitt News, Monday‘ March 028,,

From In/'ustices,Center-Searching To Sleep, Food

Roy Chipman may still be looking
for a center after the recruiting sea-
son is over. Now that Marlon Fergu-
son has announced his decision to
enter Duquesne, it appears that
Robert Cornegy, a 6-11 center
from Andrew Jackson High School
in New York, is Chipman’s last
chance. If nothing transpires, Jeff
Robinson, a transfer from Cincin-

nati, will most likely start the season M

at center. Once again, that spot will
be a question mark entering next
season,vconsidering that Robinson

saw limited action at‘ Cincinnati’

before transferring to Pitt.

Pitt may never recruit a big-name
center.

Darryl Sheppard, a 6-5 forward
transfer from Duquesne, will make
the biggest difference in the Pitt
team next year. Sheppard is a true
Big East-type player. He can run,

shoot and, above all, jump, which
takes some of the pressure off
Vaughan. He’ll score 10-15 points a
game but will be most noticed on the
offensive boards.

Too many players are transferring
these days. i

The noise persists that Pitt safety
Tom Flynn is a strong possibility to
start the season at quarterback next
season. From these precincts, it
seems unlikely. Unless Flynn can
play two-way football, he is consid-
erably more valuable on defense
than he would be on offense. At
quarterback, a position that Flynn
hasn’t played‘ since high school,
Flynn could be average at best. AT
safety, he is a legitimate candidate
for All-America status. His worth

‘was clearly visible last season when
he left the Notre Dame game with a

1983.

foot injury. A flea-flicker and a long
run from the scrimmage which fol-
lowed handed Pitt its first loss of the
season. *
Foge Fazio will get alittle more
sleep this year. The pressure of being
top-ranked, of facing something
equivalent to death before every
game, has "been replaced by the
notion that Pitt has little chanceof
winning a national championship
next year. It’s difficult to win a title
without an established quarterback.
Pitt has some quality players return-
ing, but not nearly enough to place
as much pressure on Fazio and the

‘ I-Page ll

players as there was last year.
Pitt will be ranked I 1th in the pre-
season rankings. / V

"After watching Houston annihi-
late Villanova yesterday, the conclu-
sion must be reached that ‘the
Cougars will win this year’s NCAA
tournament. No arguments came
from the Wildcats.

The South has risen again, this
time to the top of college basket-
ba.ll’s elite as the NCAA’s ﬁled of 52
teams has come down to fourteams,
all from below the Mason Dixon
line, who will take their brand of
above-the-rim, beyond-the-beer
lines, basketball to Albuquerque,
New Mexico and the hallowed
“Final Four.”

. ..Ralph Sampson is home calculat-

g what three years times an NBA
salary comes to and Big East com-
missioner Dave Gavitt is busy think-
ing up a new p.r. campaign for his
conference. Gavitt’s five representa-
tives bowed out of the tourney in ‘a
fashion befitting one of the better
conferences, maybe, but certainly
not the best. ,

The -expected—Louisville and
Houston-and the unsuspected—
North Carolina State and Georgia-
fought their way through their
respective brackets in run and gun
fashion, leading the purist, this ‘wri-
ter included, to reassess this year of
experimentation. Watching Derrick
Wittenberg loft up shots from

Q-kound the press table with alarming

accuracy may have sent Dr. Nais-
mith into a graveyard dizzy but it
sheds new light on the ACC’s pre-
viously outrageous three-point field
goal and thirty second shot clock.
On paper and by inside power,
Louisville and Houston look to be
heads, chests, and elbows above this
year’s two Cinderella teams with the
likes of McCray brothers, Rodney

UCLA—N.C. State game, will be
labeled a classic and probably
deserves it. Best to pick a survivor,
not a winner, here, in this case
Louisville and the McCrays who

With only one year ofcompetition
under its ﬁnancially thin belt, the
Atlantic 10 basketball conference
could be heading toward a sure

' solvency.

When the league replaced the vir-
tually unknown Eastern 8 just last
spring, the new teams thought the
only problem to be concerned with
was the abundance of high school-
caliber members—when compared
to other NCAA powers.

But, the new kid on the block
failed to peer around the corner to
where it was heading and see that an
unavoidable pit of quicksand lay
dead ahead. Now that it has reached
that gruesome pit, perhaps the
league itself is ready to.dig its own
grave.

Consider the following events, not
necessarily in chronological order,
but of supreme importance.

over the weekend against Florida

despite a fourth-inning homerun by
second-basemen Mike Miller, the
Panthers lost to the Seminoles 7-4.

the contest in the seventh inning.)

Tanner is the son of Pittsbur‘

only attracted a little over 5,000 die-

addicts, that entire weekend's
attendance figure just barely man-
aged to surpass the listed attendance
for the Big East championship game
between St. John’s and Boston Col-

10 may yet suffer another coaching
casualty as Mountaineer skipper
Gale Catlett is seriously pondering

$1‘: invitation sent out by Kansas to

Catlett is more than thinking about
this one since he, too, has more than
voiced his displeasure in the past
about anemic TV coverage in the
Atlantic 10 and will probably receive
due coverage nationally if he packs
his bags for the better-established
Big Eight.

All these recent occurrences may
be few and far between, but that is
highly unlikely since many other
member schools have to be wonder-
ing just what reason they had in the
first place to join a conference that
offers no TV exposure, discounting
tri-state TCS Sports. It amounts to
as much exposure as dad gives when

It is bad enough ‘that the Atlantic
l0 can only boast one potential Top
20 team—WVU——and has as other
members teams which can better
pass for last night’s leftovers instead
of reputable powerhouses. These are
the kind of teams that need TV
exposure to boost their programs’
strength. Put it this way: teams the

competitive-worthy players now
lacking.

Maybe that is why the Atlantic 10
looks so destitute right now. The Big
East is a Mercedes-Benz compared
to the Chevette of an Atlantic 10. It

had Commissioner Dave Gavitt at

the forefront holding some closed-
door sessions with the network big-
wigs who gave the Big East a
multi-million dollar contract that
would guarantee its members at
least $500,000 and at most $1.4 mil-
lion each for the duration of the
agreement.

That’s the stuff of which Atlantic
10 commissioner Leland Byrd
dreams about almost nightly. With-
out confirmed national coverage,
member schools cannot expect to
get anywhere competitively. They’ll
be running on a treadmill.

Having coverage provided by the
national networks will expose this
ﬂedgling conference to potential
recruits now tediously exposing
their wares on high school courts.
There is no other way the Atlantic 10
can possibly expect to climb the tal-

ent ladder to the rungs an Atlantic
Coast Conference or a Southeast

0 Conference now occupies.

Meanwhile, the Big East will reap
most of_ those hard-working high
school recruits who prefer to stay in
the East. It would be considered sui-
cide on their part to even think of
joining an Atlantic 10 school with
the condition it is in now compared
to the Big East (which can be seen on
national TV at least twice weekly
starting next season). _

Indeed, the neighboring Big East
is making major strides in attaining
a name for itself after increasing its
member size to nine schools. It also

helps. that itslcommissioner, Gavitt, ‘

is chairman ofthe NCAA basketball
committee.

In this case, it would do the Atlan-
tic l0 wonders if it followed its
neighbor and quickly found a TV
contract that is worthy of being
associated with a CBS or an NBC.

. If Byrd decides to sit on his keister
a little while longer, his Atlantic 10
may undergo a different type of
development: it will disappear.
