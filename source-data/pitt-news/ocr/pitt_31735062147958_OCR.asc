MANY ALA TlMER3' AT
BASEBALL -AIAAAAAA nu

While the two baseball games be-
tween ‘Pitt and Penn State at Forbesl
Field Saturday were somewhat Otf
a nightmare, and the Pitt adherents

were not in what could be termed a
jovial state of mind after everybhi-ﬁg
was over, this did not prevent the
Baseball Reunion Day -‘being a suc-
cess. Bob Grove, manager of three
Pitt varsity baseball teams -had sent
out preliminary notices to every base-
ball letter man on record, gelling
them that all they had to do to get to
the game was to send in their name,
and he would supply a “comp.-” Bob
received no =less than 100 replies,
many of the lettermen accepting, and
those who could not passing on a few
words to him. At the game many
familiar faces of players who had
done big things for Pitt in baseball
in the past were in evidence. Nat-
urally they were all sorry that the
Pitt varsity did not make a -better
showing against, the Mount Nittany
Lions, but the only comeback to the
jibes of the State fans could be
“Wait ’till next year.”,

Que of the interesting replies was
from Perry Graves of the ’12 team,
who lives in Rockford, 111.‘ Perry
was a mighty nifty inﬁelder on’ one
of the teams which Bob mqiaged.
He said in reply: “Some day Pwill’
be thefe, Bofb, but not this time. «I
am going to see Illinois beat Michi-
gan today.” L. P. (“Perk”) Ken-
nedy wrote from Schenectady, N. Y.,
where he is employed by the General
Electric Company. He expressed re-
gret that he could not be 1:, re and
cheer for the Pitt team. rk has
been pitching up aroundi Schenectady
and going ﬁg. A .

Dr. T. P. (“Perc”) Beatty advised
he could not come, as he had “a ﬁsh-
ing engagement that he could not
break.” Al Hart -who pitched Pitt
to victory over State on several oc-
casions, reported a glass arm, but
said .he would be out to the game.-
He was noticed in the crowd.

One of the most interested spec-
tators-vvas Max. L. Supper, Law '21.
Max was the mainstay of the team
last yearwhich beat State twice and
ran’ them into ten innings in the third
game. It was his ﬁght which had, as.
much as anything else to win those
great victories at State, and every.
Pitt; man’ who is familiar with the
circumstances takes his but off tof
him. Max is now practicing law in
Pittsburgh and doing. we On sev-E
eral occasions he has been up on the‘
ﬁeld this year helping Dick Harley‘
and offering his services to work with-

had walked out of the hospital and
disappeared. Whether such was the
case, or whether he was killed in ac-

“The article in ‘The Gazette’ bears

The item follows: «N

The body of Lieutenant Charles

ment, according to an announcement
received at his former home in Ford
City. ,,

Lieut. Ballibach was ‘born in Sharps-

Millvale. He was sent to France
with the Dental Corps, Three Hun-

now been established that his body
is in the morgue of the American
Cemetery of the Oise in the province
of Aisne, France. A
The notice of the ﬁnding of the
body was addressed to the soldier’s
wife, who died in June, 1920. The
body will be sent from France to the
home of the dead man’s mother in

the body of Mrs. Balbach in the ceme-

the University of Cincinnaii athletic

picnic at Vilsaok Stop on the Butler
-Shortline, Saturday, June 3. The
the two-thirty
-0’-clock car at Stanwix street, across
gfrom Joseph‘ Home Company. Each

and drinking cup. A large picnic
‘supper and -a marshmallow toast are
‘in store for those who go. 4*’

them, “inartistic Bug-bears.”
, .

The letter follows:

' “Every time you cross the lower
‘campus, the Erhwing attractiveness of
Alumni Hall gains your appreciation,
Progress on the landscaping and ter-
racing is making an excellent setting
for the simple and majecticv lines of
the long building. ‘

“But there is a horrible discordant
note! Three black gaiint telegraph
poles, top tethered by a dozen or more
hideous wires stand forth in full view.

“You will notice that no poles ex-
ploit the beauty of either 0’Hara Bou-
levard or Parkman avenue and
I see -little need of these ghastly
sentinels loitering on our campus.

“I wish some effective student or-
ganization would take it upon them-
selves to chase off these dnartistic
bug-bears. Even the cold mechanical

a cost accountant is constantly per-
turbed by their presence. And this
very same cost accountant stands
ready to credit cash $10,, as a starter
towards a fund for furnishinga first
class funeral in the way of burying
those wires two feet underground.

C Cafeteria Serves   Between 4

$350 to400 Meals Daily

 

Average Cost of Lunches For Girls is 28.6 Cents and For
Men 36.2 Cents-Vegetable Menu is Most Popular Diet .

 

Men and women on the University
campus consume 800 pounds of sugar,
750 loaves of bread, 12,000 rolls,
5,000 cuts of-pie, 6,000 orders of ice
cream, 8,000 portions of ‘potatoes,
4,000 orders -of vegetrbles, 4,000
salads and 4,500 sandwiches for lunch
monthly accﬁding to ﬁgures ob-

tained from the manager of the Uni-

versity cafeteria.

A study has been made by astu-
dent taking a course’ in Statistics to
determine the expenditures and-types
of meals that men and women stu-
dents and faculty members eat. More

than 10 per cent of the persons on‘
-the campus get their lunch 0 at the

Cafeteria. The investigation showed
the Cafeteria serves between 350 to
400 daily. As usual the girls showed
their economic resourcefulness in
paying on 511 average of 28.6 cents
for their lunolies, while the men av-
eraged 36.2 cents. ’

‘The Cafeteria is directly under the
control of the University and the
persons in "charge try to give the stu-
dent the most and best at a minimum
cost. For this reason the menu de-
pends upon market conditions. Even
the variety of pies is affected -by the
price of dairy products, and the meat
market -determines whether roast veal
,or beef will comprise the diet of the
‘lunchers.

o

The following table shows the expenditures for meals by the total num-
ber of men and women at the University Cafeteria, between 11:30 7/and. 1:15

o’clock, March 9, 11, 15 17 and -27.

decisions were. announced. To the dis-
Lagpointment of ‘Ell ,Pittites,V the Nit-
Ltany Lion‘ had emerged from '-both
contests almost unscathed - and* un-
scratched and had rendered its cousin
“two decisive beatings. L To sum ;, up
‘all, Penn State defeated us in both

winning the ﬁrst;-game, 11-2, and the
sdecond,-~10-2L. 7 V j - it

,These two games were
played as anyone“ would care to see
a college game» played. Twenty-two
errors were icomimittedr in the two cogn-
tests, eachteam making 11. But in
spite of the large number of ﬁelding
misplays, there was one play thata1—
,mQst atoned, for all the errors made
‘ in‘ both —‘~games~.- Incidentally this -, feat

drepresentatives.  The ; feat _ came in
the form- of a well eng-ineeredftriple
play in State’s"ha1f of the eighth inn-
‘ing of the ‘ﬁrst game.» Bases P were

However, much credit must be accord-

used Mellinger for his Lhitcher. As

error started State’s scoring. Ullery,
