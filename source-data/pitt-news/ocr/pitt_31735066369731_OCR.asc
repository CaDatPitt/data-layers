Renovation

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

The renovation of the Student
Union‘ was not an idea thatjust came
to university officials out of the clear
blue sky. In 1967, the first sugges-
tionsabout renovation were aired.

Fifteen years and $13 million
later, the renovation will be com-
pleted, and -the new William Pitt
Union will officially open for busi-
ness on September 8.

Between I967 and October 1979,
when the university became serious
about the renovation, there were a
number of different plans concern-
ing the renovation, according to stu-
dent activities director W. Andrew
Smith.

Smith said there were several

‘ plans during that time, including

one that would call for the building
to be completely leveled and rebuilt.
Another suggestion was to wrap
another building around the existing
one. Obviously, neither of these
plans satisfied the administration.

When Smith came to Pitt in I979,
he said any renovation program was
“virtually dead at the time.” It was
during that year that interest in the
renovation was revitalized and new
plans were devised. One plan in par-
ticular met with the approval of all
university officials.

They decided to keep the student
union in Schenley Hall and renovate
the inside and the grounds. This
decision was made because of sev-
eral factors. First of all, Smith said,
the location of the building was the
best place for the student union
because of its proximity to the rest of
the campus—it is near the Cathedral
of Learning and the dorms.

Secondly, when a survey was
made of the building, it found that
the shell of the building was sound.
Lastly, Smith said, the building had

" historical significance, so it should

be salvaged and restored.

“We wanted something personal
and something unique,” Smith said.
“The historical areas of the building

. could provide that."

Between October 1979 and April
1980, cost estimates were made and
the renovation was evaluated. By
April 1980, Smith said they had a
rough plan and bids were put out in
the fall of 1981. In addition, the uni-
versity brought in consultants for
various areas of the student union
such as WPGH Radio and The Pitt
News and the Multi-Purpose Room.

The university employed the
Pittsburgh architectural firm of Wil-
liams, Trebilcock and Whitehead,
and on Dec. 23, I981, the construc-
tion and renovation started. J

Smith said he and the architects
got along well because there was an
understanding between them.

“I knew I wasn’t an architect, so I
didn’t act like one, and they weren’t
student activities directors, so they
didn't act like one,” he said.

Smith relied heavily on the archi-
tects in the area of what the building
was to look like, and in return, the
architects were made aware of what

William Pitt Union

An Idea Whose Time Has Come

was necessary to run an efficient stu-
dent union building. There were
times when the architects would
draw something and bring it in to the
university only to be told the plan
wouldn’t work. Smith said there
were some areas that had to be
changed 20 or 30 times before some-
thing was found that would work.

One of the problems Smith and
the architects encountered was mak-
ing the lower level—the basement
before the renovation——not look like
a basement. Smith said that is the
reason for the atrium: it brings in
natural light.

By the time the plans were all
final, Smith said he was quite
pleased with the outcome.

“It was smaller than we wanted,
but it meets a great deal of our needs
and is the best possible [student
union] we could come up with.”

There has been an increase in the
amount of lounge space, program-
ming space, student office space and
student affairs space.

“Some areas that weren’t safe in
the building, we had to ‘update and
modernize, and we were able to res-
tore historical areas that are abso-
lutely beautiful,” Smith said.

There are historical areas on the
main floor. In addition, thereare
two rooms on the upper floors with
historical significance. On the fourth
floor, there is a room called “The
Lillian Russell Suite.”The room was
restored to resemble the famous sin-
ger’s parlour when she lived in the
Schenley Hotel. The suite will be
used as a special conference room
for Pitt’s student media groups. A
room on the seventh floor has been
restored to resemble an ‘old court-
room. This will be where the Student
Judicial Board holds its hearings.

Smith said the trees, grass and
benches around the building also
add to the unique and historical
qualities of the student union.

‘‘It’s a personal building,” he said.
“Its going to be full of living things
both inside and out."

When students walk in the Fifth
Avenue side of the new student
union, they will find the information
desk, theticket office and the reser-
vations offfice to the left.

To the right, in the old Litchfield
Suite where the Pitt Program Coun-
cil (PPC) used to be, there will be a
Jazz Hall of Fame and an art gallery.
Following those two rooms will
come the lower lounge and pro-
gramming area. The lounge will seat
approximately 50 people as a quiet
study area and I00 plus people when
it’s used as a programming area. The
original chandeliers have been res-
tored and will grace the room that’s
held up by marble pillars.

The PPC offices will once again
be on the main floor. The offices are
split level with the secretary and
receptionist occupying the main
entrance. The student offices are on
the second level and access to their
offices is obtained by a spiral
staircase-

The Kurtzman Room has also
been restored to its original beauty.

Large, ornate chandeliers hang from
the ceiling in this room, which will
be used for meetings, banquets and
receptions.

The ballroom that once was the
pride and joy of the old Schenley
Hotel has lost none of its charm in
l983. Everything in this large room
has been restored to look exactly as
it did when presidents and movie
legends danced there in the early
part of the century. The room is of a
Louis XV design and Smith said it is
as faithful to the original as possible.

The main (or grand) lounge is in
the same spot as the old student
union, the old lobby of the Schenley
Hotel. All the marble has been kept
and the “stairway to nowhere” has
been retained. There will be a lot of
seating, Smith said, amid palm trees.

Finally, on the main ﬂoor, is the‘
multi-purpose room. This room will .

be used for lectures, dances, small
concerts, movies and banquets. It
seats 700 people theatre-style and
450 people banquet-style. The room
has a portable and fixed stage, a
large control unit for projectors and
lighting.

The West Court entrance will ena-
ble students to enter the building
between McCormick and Bruce
Halls. Smith said this entrance was
put in so dorms students would feel
welcome and won’t have to go out of
their way to get into the building.

On the lower level is a televison
room, which hold.about 25 people
and a large lounge area with tables
and park benches; this is called the
Concourse. Students will be able to
bring bagged lunches or eat lunch at
the food services area that will be set
up there. The tables will have chess
and checker boards ingrained in the
top so students can indulge in some
recreation.

\ There will also be a large game
room with 13 pool tables and other
table-top games. This room is
paneled with the doors from the old
hotel and adds to the uniqueness of
the building.

Adjacent to this room is asound-
proof room with 18 or 19 of the
latest video gamesand next to this is
a room with championship-sized
table tennis tables.

A food service area will also be
housed on this floor. There will be
two lines serving salads, sandwiches
and other dishes. The cafeteria-style
area will be open from 7 a.m. to 8
p.m. on the weekdays and Smith
said both the menu and prices are
good. Off to the side will be seating
for approximately 200 people, in
addition to a quiet solarium where
students can eat their lunches.

Smith said the lower level will
mainly be used for interaction
between students. Students can eat,
play games and relax, and the longer
hours of the food service will benefit
commuters and night students. The
main floor is a more purposeful
floor. Students on that floor can get
things accomplished by using the
ticket windows, the PPC offices and
the study areas.

Union is just one of the areas that has been restored for historical

signiﬁcance.

Students Help F inanceCosts

Pitt’s renovated student union
really does belong to the students.
Tuition was raised last fall, partly to
fund the renovation, according to

Jack Freeman, vice-chancellor for -

administration.

Pitt was issued $23 million by the
Allegheny County Higher Educa-
tion Assistance Authority in the
form of tax-exempt bonds to help
with the initial financing of the reno-
vation. Thirteen million went
toward the student union, and the
remaining $8 million went to the
Law School.

The combination of the hike in
tuition and funds from the physical
plant department covered approxi-
mately $12 million of the payback.
Freeman estimated that the total
cost of the renovation will be around
$14 million—$l million more than
expected. He said the extra million
dollars was needed because many of
the steel support girders in the base-
ment were deteriorating and had to
be replaced, plus the 10th floor of
the building had to be totally
removed.

Students «had to pay for the new
student union, Freeman said, for
several reasons. First of all, since the
renovation process unofficially
started in l967, Pitt had been trying
to convince the state to fund the pro-
ject, to no avail. Secondly, he said,

“it’s hard to raise money._these days

for bricks and mortar.”

Nobody in the administration
wanted to raise tuition to pay for the
renovation, he said, but the univer-
sity had no other alternative. If tui-
tion was not raised, Freeman said,

 Pitt might have had to charge a fee-

such as the student activities fee-in
order for students to use the student
union. That way of generating funds
would have cost the students more in
the long run, he said. _

“It’s easier to get student aid to
pay for (tuition),” he said. “Finan-
cial aid doesn’t pay for many fees, so
we didn‘t think it would be a wise
decision.” ,’

Freeman said alumni groups will
also be contacted to help maintain
the building.

Although the country is suffering
from bad economic times, Freeman
said, it's not unusual for a large pro-
ject such as the renovation to take
place.

“We had probably the worst stu-
dent union of any major university
in the Northeast," he said. “A stu-
dent union is an essential element in
university life. The university has to
maintain the quality of its services as
well as it’s academics.”

Freeman said he is quite pleased
with the new building and called it
an “architectural masterpiece.”

“We made a silk purse out of a
sow‘s ear," he said. “It's striking.”

The grand opening of the new
student union has officially been
scheduled for Wednesday, Sept.
7, I983.

Events to take place include
speeches by Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, Vice-Chancellor for Stu-
dent Affairs Conney Kimbo,
Student Activities Director
Andy Smith, representatives
from the Massaro Corporation,

Grand Opening Planned  

a representative from Williams,
Trebilcock and Whitehead, and
student representatives.

Following ribbon-cutting
ceremonies by Posvar and two
student leaders, there will be a
dinner for univerisity officals,
affiliates and student leaders,
and the building will officially
open at 7 a.m. on Sept. 8.

Author Willa Cat-her once des- I

cribed Pitt’s student union in a short
story as “a warm, lighted building,
an exotic, tropical world of shiny
surfaces and basking ease.”

Pitt’s student union?

Well, actually she was referring to -

the building whentit was known as
the Schenley Hotel. In its heyday,

. the Schenley Hotel was a ﬂourishing

haven for the idle rich and “the only
place in town to get fresh caviar.”

Anyone with a claim to power,
notoriety or wealth congregated at
the Schenley Hotel in the years,
between 1898 and 1954. But the
hotel actually reached its pinnacle of
magnificence‘ during its first 30
years, before, depression and war
took their toll on the opulent life
styles of the nation’s elite.

A guest book that was unearthed
during the spring of 1956, just before
the hotel was sold to‘the university,
revealed the ghosts of some, of the
glamorous people who registered at
the Schenley in 1908. .

On April 6, H.S. Firestone, the
rubber tire tycoon, checked in at the
hotel for a vacation from what was

‘then just a growing business. Only

40 years old at the time, he was to
become" the multi’-millionaire chair-
man of the board for one of the
world’s largest rubber companies
before his death 30 years later. He
vacationed often with friends Henry
Ford and Thomas Edison.

The original and eternal Peter
Pan, ‘actress Maude Adams, regis-
tered at the hotel on April 13.
Adams was described as the mystery
woman of her era, -never allowing
herself to be, photographed during
her entire career, and never once in
20 years did she talk with a reporter.
Adams retired from the stage nine
years after her stay at the Schenley,
maintaining her World War I style
of dress for the rest of her life.

In May, the most idolized opera
singer of the day, the great Enrico
Caruso, stayed at the hotel just three
years after taking Pittsburgh by
storm in his debut in the city.

Four years before ‘his election to
the presidency of the United States,
Woodrow Wilson checked in as, the
president‘ of Princeton University.

One of the most- legendary of the
hotel’s guests, A.P. Moore, was reg-
istered for June 4, just four years
before he rocked Pittsburgh by mar-
rying the even more legendary sin-
ger, Lillian Russell.

Moore and Russell together made
one of the,country’s most ﬂamboy-
ant co_uples. Moore was an interna-

tionally known Pittsburgh

become U.S. Ambassador to Spain
and Russell was the foremost popu-
lar singer of her era. Their wedding,
held in the French suite of the old
hotel, was" one of the most talked
about social events of the period.
Because of Russell’s love for the
Schenley, a room on the fourth floor
of the student union has been res-
tored to look exactly like her parlor
when she lived there. The roomhas
appropriately been dubbed the “Lil-
lian Russell Suite.”

Theodore Roosevelt and Charles
Evans Hughes were guests of the
hotel at one time, and President Wil-
liam Howard Taft once wrapped a
napkin around his hand to prevent
injury from pounding his fist on a
table during a speech in the
ballroom.

Eleanora Duse, the great Italian
tragedian, died in the Schenley
Hotel on April 24, 1924, in a_corner
suite on the ﬁfth floor. She had con-
tracted pneumonia while looking for
the stage entrance to the "Syria
Mosque in a rain storm. A plaque
honoring her was placed in Schenley
Hall in 1954. ’

“Diamond Jim” Brady was a fre-
quent guest at the Schenley and
ﬂashed his costly sparklers under the
crystal chandeliers of the luxiorious,
mirrored ballroom.

In an interview for Pittsburgh
Magazine in 1974, historian James
Van Trump said of the old Schenley:

“It was an important place,
socially,” he said. “It also had a cer-
tain distinction, you know. It was

comfortable and cozy and above all, I

it was a
Magnificent.”

Van Trump said that the Schenley
was an imitation of the Plaza Hotel
in New York, and at that time in
Pittsburgh’s history, a great palace
hotel was needed with what he called
“much French, much marble and
much plush.”

In the late 1900s, there was practi-
cally nothing in the area besides the
Carnegie Institute, according to Van
Trump, before architect Franklin
Nicola decided to build a palace-
style hotel as a cornerstone for a
civic center in Oakland.

glamorous place.‘

The property where the Schenley
stands was once a cow pasture
owned by the late Mary Crogan

Schenley. All of the cultural activity ,

at the time was centered in the
Market Square district of down-
town, and Nicolawanted to develop
the Oakland district as part of the
civic center plan. .

To realize his dream,
formed the Belleﬁeld Corporation

' with H.C. Frick, Andrew Carnegie, ,

George Westinghouse and HJ.
Heinz among the. original 56
stockholders. ' . ' i

“Nicola bought the Schenley est-
ate and laid out a new district, just
like that,” Van Trump said. “So
Pittsburgh. had 'it———great palace
hotel. The great American pheno-
menon. And it brought the people to
Oakland. They came because of the
fine foods, the luxury and the glam-
our. Eventually, everything just
grew up around it. ~

“But that was a long time ago. The
Schenley will never be for me what it
once was. Once the university took
over, that was the end,” Van Trump
said.

In 1954, the hotel’s name was
changed to the Schenley Park Hotel
and it became an “up-to-date hotel
for transients.”

The marble floors of the lobby
were covered with red carpeting and
25 more guest rooms were added by
carving up the large corner suites.
The lobby was made into a cocktail
lounge and men’s bar.

The section where Enrico Caruso
once rented an entire wing for his
troupe was remodeled into smaller
rooms and the Continental dining
room was redecorated. -

In I956, the Schenley Park Hotel
was sold to the university for over
$1.8 million to be used as the student
union building, housing the mathe-
matics department and student
groups.

The Jan. 9, 1956 edition of The
Pitt News announced the purchase
of the Schenley Park Hotel by the
university community and said Pitt's
action was a stepping stone in the
university’s goal to become “one” of

_ the world’s foremost universities.”

The name of Schenley Hall is

. in the process of being officially
changed to the William Pitt
Union. Chancellor Wesley,Pos-
var will ask the Board of Trustees
at .its next meeting to officially
adopt the name,.and Schenley

Hall will be stricken from the ,

records.

Just who was William Pitt?
Sure, he is the namesake of Pitts-
burgh, but most people don’t
know who he was and what made

him so special that a city was_

named after him.

I William Pitt the Elder (his son
was the Younger) was born on
Nov. 15, 1708, in Westminster,
England, according to the
Encyclopedia ‘Americana. In
1727, he entered Trinity College
at Oxford but left before receiv-
ing his degree because he deve-
loped gout, which would haunt
him all his adult life.

In I735, his powerful older
brother got Pitt a seat in Parlia-
ment, and in 1746, he was made
Paymaster General of the Armed
Forces — one of the highest posi-
tions in 18th century England.

In 1755, he was dismissed from
that office because he opposed,“
and fought, the prime minister’s
policy of buying British allies in
Europe. At the beginning "of the
Seven Years War in I756, how-
ever, King George Ilgrealized he

needed Pitt and_ appointed him

H William Pitt.‘ Who WasHe?

the secretary of state. He was
also the leader of the House of
Commons, thus his nickname
“the Great Commoner”' was
born.

In June of I757, Pitt and the7

prime minister joined forces to

‘more or less share the office. Pitt

was a “minister of the people,”

» responsible for the conduct" of‘

the war. and foreign affairs. It

was during this tenure that Pitt .

secured Canada for the British.
In 1758, General Forbes, the
British soldier who took control
of Fort Duquesne from the
French, wrote Pitt and told him
that he was naming that area of
Pennsylvania after him —— hence

Pittsburgh was born. Although ‘

he opposed independence for the
American colonies, Pitt often
took the side of the colonials in
such matters as the Stamp Act
and other Parliamentary laws
that he knew were detrimental to
their livelihood.

King George III made Pitt the
First Earl of Chatam in 1766 and

commissioned him to form a _
ministry with Parliament. Pitt’si '
never-ending fight with the gout, 
however, went to his mind and he s
‘ failed at this task. 
Pitt died in 1778 in Parliament

after giving a speech denouncing

the British monarchy and went _
down in history as one of Bri-‘

If the fraternity scene fades or the
bar’ scene becomes boring, the Pitt
Program Council (PPC), the univer-
sity’s major programming organiza-
tion, provides students with a
variety of alternate activities.

Director Gina Miller and pro-
gram coordinator Ric Fogle help the
approximately 200 student volun-
teers, who serve on 14 committees,
plan and implement various pro-
grams throughout the year.

The existing committees from last
year include: arts, concert, enter-
tainment, film, homecoming and
special events, lecture, technical pro-
duction and travel.

Five new committees, added this
year, will help bring even more
diverse activities to campus. The
recreation committee will sponsor
tournaments for games like table
tennis, billiards, video games, chess
and backgammon and will feature
well known individuals in the recrea-
tion ﬁeld. Paul Gurney, the trick
shot champion in billiards, will dem-
onstrate his skills early this fall.

Coffeehouse, another new com-

mittee, will select and produce var-
ious programs in the newly
renovated student union. Local
bands, such as The Core, serve as
just one of the programs coffee-
houses include. This year, a Student
Talent Night is another event to look
forward to.

Movies and videos will be selected
and shown daily in the student
union, courtesy of the video
committee. .

Leisure Learning, a first for PPC
this year, is a series of non-credit
courses designed especially for
students. _

The renovation of the William
Pitt Union seems to be in” the
spotlight as the new school year
quickly approaches. There is,
however, another “renovation”
under way, and although it will

not cost the university close to-

$14 million, this “renovation”
will have an effect on many
students.

The Interfraternity Council
(IFC) adopted a new dry rush
policy that will go into effect with
this fall's rush. A dry rush means
that no alcoholic beverages will
be served during the open rush
period.

Last year, IFC hosted a retreat
for all fraternity presidents to
discuss any problems that the
individual fraternities, or frater-_
nities as a whole, were having.
The alcohol issue was mentioned

. there, and work on the new poli-

cies started in early February.

According to Mike Pasternak,
internal .vice-president for IFC,
the changes occurred basically
because “a few rush parties got
out of hand,”

Pasternak said he feels that
IFC took the initiative to
develop new policies on its own.
Lynn Weinberg, Panhellenic
president said she thought the
policy stemmed from the univer-
sity administration.

Whatever the case, Bridget
Guernsey, the new Greek

' adviser, said the changes were “in

coming” and would have been
made eventually. .

The format for fraternity rush
this year will not deviate too
much from the past. The annual
Watermelon Picnic will be the
starting event for both the frater-
nities and sororities.

IF C Dry Rush Policy
In Effect This Fall

Anyone who has purchased a
rush card will be able to attend
open rush, the (only difference
being that no alcohol will be per-

mitted to be served to any of the «

freshmen / rushees.

Closed rush will be by invita-
tion only. There is to be no
advertising of any closed rush
events and there is to be no fee

charged upon entering. Both of-

these rules remain from the past.
Another rule instituted states
that no freshmen/rushees are to
be in the houses during brother-.
hood events. ’
Although details concerning
the enforcement of the new poli-
cies are still being worked on,
certain penalties have been
established for each offense. ,
For the first offense, a frater-
nity will be assessed a $100-$300

fine and will be barred from play- '

ing intramural _ sports for one
term. Decisions dealing with the
monetary penalty will be left up
to the IFC executive board.

If a second and /or succeeding
offense should occur, there will
be a line of between $500 and
$700.-

Catching any violators of the
dry rush policy will not be an
easy task, but IFC plans to make
a concerted effort to ensure that
the policy is maintained. .

IFC officers will be monitor-
ing the open rush parties, and
Pasternak said, “If there is alco-

hol there, it will be pretty hard to

hide." .

Pasternak and Guernsey agree
that the fraternities are nervous
about this year’s rush because it
is something they have never
tried before, and both are hoping
that it is as successful at Pitt as it
has been on other college
campuses.

Top Stories Of The

ORL AdoptsNew Alcohol Policy For Dorms

In the fall of 1982, the vice-chancellor for student affairs, Conney Kimbo,
established three alcohol task force committees to study the problems of
drinking among Pitt students. The task forces consisted of one for the

residence halls, one for the Greeks and one for student activities. The task .

forces were designed to study the alcohol problem if indeed there was one,
and come up with answers on how to alleviate the problem

The task forces’ work was put on hold after Thanksgiving because of
upcoming finals and Christmas break. Following Todd Becker’s death,
however, the administration became deeply concerned about drinking on
Pitt property and decided to make some strict changes concerning the
alcohol policies. ,

The InterFraternity Council (IFC) adopted a new dry rush policy, and the
serving of alcoholic beverages has all but been banned from all student
functions. But perhaps the biggest changes are the ones that will be instituted
this fall in the residence halls. The director ofORL, Jo Ann Woodson, sent a
memo to all dorm students over the summer informing them of the changes
in the policy. The new rules are as follows:

0Only residents 21 years of age or older are permitted to possess, consume
or transport alcoholic beverages into the residence halls.
OResidents from other buildings and non-residents, guests orcommuters
are not permitted entrance with alcoholic beverages, regardless of age.
0Distribution of alcoholic beverages to residents / guests under 21 is abso-
lutely prohibited. . .
0Only factory sealed containers of alcoholic beverages may bebrought
into the residence halls. .
0Beer may only be brought intothe building in cans. Others containers,

0All alcoholic beverages must be registered. Residence hall identification 2

and proof of age must be presented to the desk attendant, and an “Alcoholic
Beverage Registration Form” must be completed before entry is permitted.

0Alcoholic beverages are registered to a resident’s assigned room. Alco-
holic beverages cannot be transported to another room for any reason, nor
are they permitted in any public area. 6

0The amount of alcoholic beverages registered per person per seven day
period cannot exceed (a) twelve (12) cans of beer (b) a pint bottle or 375 ml.
of liquor or (c) one (1) 1.5 liter bottle of wine. -

0Residents are limited to five (5) visitors at any one time.

0Residents are absolutely responsible and legally accountable for their
actions and the actions of their visitors, including any damages or injuries
which result from their actions during or after the consump_tion of alcoholic
beverages.

0Residents and guests will be subject to disciplinary action upon failure to
comply with the above guidelines or any other residence hall or university
regulation.

Tuition
Hiked
Again

Once again Pitt students learned

this summer they would have to‘
dig deeper into their pockets as

tuition was raised 9.5 percent or

$210 more for the 1983-84 school-
year.

The tuition hike, the tenth in
as many years, raised the full-
time, in-state, undergraduate tui-
tion for the Colleges of Arts and
Sciences and General Studies
and the-Schools of Education
and Social Work from $2,210 to
2,420. Tuition for out-of-state
students doubled.

The Schools of Engineering,
Library and Information Science
(LIS), Nursing and others, as
well as graduate and professional
programs faced even higher tui-
tion increases.

The tuition hike by the Board
of Trustees was based on Pitt’s

Book Store Firings
Stir Controversy

The university made local head-
lines in January after two Book Cen-
ter employees were fired and three
were suspended for what they said
were their attempts to form a union
within the store.

Chuck Delaney and Tim Brady
were suspended from the store on
Jan. 7 and were told they were fired
permanently on Jan. 18. Imme-
diately after the firings, Pitt initially
refused, but later denied that the ﬁr-
ings had anything to do with union-
izing attempts.

Delaney and Brady, along with
their attorney Dan Kaufman, filed a
grievance with the Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Board (PLRB)
shortly after the firings. The ‘two
employees initiated union card-
signing activities in order to attempt
to better their wages and benefits.
Workers at the bookstore receive
minimum wages because they are
not represented. The employees

were trying to be recognized by Pitt
as Local 101 of the Retail Whol&le
Department Store Union.

Pitt said Delaney was fired
because of his refusal to report back
to work for a mandatory overtime
assignment and for issuing threats of
bodily harm to the shipping and
receiving supervisor.

Brady was fired, Pitt said, because
he refused a mandatory overtime
assignment, in addition to making
“scurrilous and obscene” allegations
concerning Book Center director
Mary Bonach and making threats
and behaving insubordinately
towards another supervisor.

The Allegheny Joint Regional
Board (AJRB), representing both
Brady and Delaney, accused Pitt of
unfair labor practices because of the
firings, but on June 21, the PLRB
ruled that Pitt was not wrong in the
firings.

Becker Dies After Fall

One of the biggest stories of the
1982-83 school year occurred while
many Pitt students were leaving, or
had already left, campus for Christ-
mas break.

Pitt football player Todd Becker
was killed in the early morning
hours on Dec. 16 after he fell from a
third floor window in Brackenridge
Hall. Becker, a sophomore, had
attended an unauthorized party on
the sixth floor of Brackenridge on
the last day. of finals. He had been
banned from the dorms following an
incident in his freshman year, but
snuck into Brackenridge that night.

Nobody is really sure how Becker
got into the dorm, but he allegedly

Officers
Elected

The Student Government Board
race saw an unusual number of can-
didates runnning for various posi-
tions. While only two candidates
contested for the position of the
presidency, 23 students were in the
running for only eight board
positions.

Spencer Davis, a board member
in the 1982 school year, squared-off
against new comer Mark Downs for
the presidency. The two candidates
were almost indistinguishable
because they both agreed on many

‘ key issues, such as teaching evalua-
tions, student aid and funding for
student groups. So, the race cen-
tered on Downs’ and Davis’ expe-
rience with SGB rather than their
qualifications as presidential
hopefuls.

Election day brought controversy
to the usually boring tallying. Board
candidate Arpi Asdourian resigned
from the race after charges of jeop-
ardizing the fairness of the election
were levelled against her.

Ballots were stolen from a Hill-
man Library polling place, but
charges against Asdourian were
dropped by the Elections Commit-
tee after she resigned. The polling
place was left unattended for about
10 minutes while election committee
workers were changing shifts.

Following the incident with
Asdourian, the election came off
without a hitch. Downs defeated
Davis by 250 votes to become yet
another in a long line of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity brothers to hold the
post of the SBG president.

New board members were: Jeff
Shaffer, Jeff Delmontagne, Mark
Steele, Kathy Brown, Barry Greene,
Dan Lecce, Ken Stram and Craig
Murphey. Shortly after the election,

Steele resigned from his board posi- b

tion because of academic duties and
was replaced by the next highest

panicked when it looked as if he
might be discovered by members of
the Office of Residence Life (ORL).
Friends of Becker said that he was
afraid that if he were caught, he
might not have been able to travel to
Dallas with the rest of the Panthers
the following day to start pratice for
the Cotton Bowl and he might even
have been kicked off the team.

He climbed out a third floor win-
dow, approximately 40 feet above
the ground, and tried to make the
jump to the ground. He hit an air
conditioning unit, flipped over and
hit the ground with his head, killing
himself instantly.

The Panthers dedicated the Cot-
ton Bowl to their teammate, and his
death was felt by all Pitt students
when they returned to school in
early January.

It's not unusual for those in the
sportsworld to look to Pittsburgh
for good football. After all, the
Steelers won four Super Bowls, and
the country was accustomed to see
winning teams come out of the city.

Last fall, however, the eyes of the
sportsworld were turned to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Sports maga-
zines, journals, wire services,
newspapers and a host of other pub-
lications prophesized that the
Panthers would beat all their oppo-
nents and go on to be the national
champs. Foge Fazio was in his first
year of coaching following Jackie
Sherill’s southward trek; Dan
Marino, Jimbo Covert and other
great seniors were preparing to play
their last season.

There were very few doubts in the
minds of all that Pitt would be
Number One. It was destined to be
the Year of the Panther.

The season was kicked-off in
grand style. The Panthers met the
North Carolina Tar Heels in a
nationally-televised game at Three
Rivers Stadium. Now the eyes ofthe
nation were definitely upon Foge &
Co. The showing, however, was less
than impressive as Pittjust squeaked
by North Carolina 7-6.

Much of the second game was
played in a severe downpour in Tal-

‘ 1982-83 School Year

lahassee, Fla., against the Florida
State Seminoles. It wasn‘t quite cer-
tain which was raging louder—the
storm or the Seminole fans.
Although FSU took a quick 10-0
lead in the first quarter, the Panthers
were able to come back and whip the
Seminoles 37-17.

Pitt’s defense sparkled the next
week when Pitt travelled to Illinois
to meet the powerful lllini. In front

* of over 71,000 fans, Pitt shut down

Ilinois 20-3.

Amid cheers of “Go Home,
Mountaineers," the Panthers played
their first game in Pitt Stadium on a
clear, autumn day against arch-rival
West Virginia University. WVU’s
defense played mean, but Pitt was
able to slide by with only minutes
left in the game 16-13.

After taking a week off, the
Panthers met the Temple Owls in
Pitt Stadium for the annual Home-
coming Game. Pitt’s offense once
again had problems in the first half,
and it wasn’t until the fourth quarter
that Pitt was able to beat Temple
38-17.

Coach Fazio uncharacteristically
lost his patience with the media fol-
lowing Pitt’s win over the Syracuse

Orangemen 14-0. Fazio’s temper.

boiled over after he faced one too
many questions concerning Pitt’s
sagging offense.

Shortly before the Christmas
break, the Pitt athletic depart-
ment announced that it was elim-
inating men’s volleyball and
women’s field hockey because of
a lack of funds.

Athletic Director Ed Bozik
said the decision came after 18

months of discussion. The
department was faced with a
reduction in funds, and Bozik
said he cut the budgets ofthe two
programs because neither has
scholarships and there are no
commitments to the student-
athletes.

Football Season Disappointing

Pitt definitely looked as if it were
on the way to a National Champion-
ship afterslaughtering the Louisville
Cardinals 63-14 on the day before
Halloween. The once-sputtering
offense scored 49 points in the first
half, and Fazio was able to use some
of his second-team players in the
second half.

Nov. 6, 1982-the day of decision
for the Panthers. The fans poured
into Pitt Stadium to see" the team
play one of its toughest games of the
season—against the Fighting Irish
of Notre Dame. The luck ofthe lrish
was too much for Pitt, however, and
along with any hopes of a national
championship, the Panthers fell 31-
16..Following the game, the Pan-
thers dropped from No. l to No. 8
on the AP poll and to No. 7 on the
UP] poll. ’

The Panthers took a week off to
recuperate from the Notre Dame
loss and easily beat Rutgers 52-6.
After the game, the Cotton Bowl
Committee formally invited Pitt to
Dallas to meet the Southern Meth-
odist University Mustangs on New
Year's Day.

The Panthers had their last
chance for revenge and for a
national title when they met the
Penn State Nittany Lions in Happy
Valley. Controversial calls marred
the game, and Pitt finished the regu-
lar season with a 19-10 defeat by the
Lions.

New Year’s Day dawned bright in
Dallas and Pitt tried its best to
regain the prestige it lost earlier in
the season. The bowl game
resembled the Panthers‘ season all to
closely, and the offense sputtered
and died. Pitt lost to the SMU Mus-
tang’s, who, some said, “were on a
mission from God,” 7-3.

Opinion

Lost Identity

Next week marks the official opening of the renovated
student union. The job cost approximately $14 million -
much of it taken from tuition — but students will definitely
get their money's worth. ‘

The new student union is an architectural masterpiece and
is undoubtedly one of the classiest student unions to be
found at any major university in the country. It blends both
historical and modern artifacts while also meeting the needs
of every student on campus. _

‘ There's only one problem with the building, however, and
that is it's name.

While most Pitt students were away for the summer, the
administration went ahead and changed the name of Schen-
ley Hall to the William Pitt Union. While the name change is
not official as of yet, the Board of Trustees is expected to
okay it without much hassle. -

The university’s reasoning behind the name change is that
the name “Schenley” has no historical significance to the
university while “William Pitt” is the namesake of the city
and the school. But the name Schenley does have historical
signficance to the city and the school.

Before the university purchased the building in the late
1950s, it was known as the Schenley Hotel and was Pitts-
burgh’s, as well as one of the country’s, finest hotels. Digni-
taries, entertainers, politicians and celebrities of all kinds
wined, dined and slept in the rooms of the Schenley.

They came here during the days of Andrew Carnegie,
when Pittsburgh was known as “the smokey city”. The
Schenley family was one of Pittsburgh’s founding families

.. and was a major contributor of land and had a large part in

developing the town.

Commuting Made Simpler 

By MARCIA ANSTANDIG

A University of "Pittsburgh com-

" muter is any student who does not

live in a campus dormitory. The
commuters represent 87 percent of
the school’s population. If the uni-
versity is comprised of so many com-
muters, why is it so difficult for
many students to feel at ease with
commuting to and from Pitt? Are
commuters at a disadvantage over
resident students when it comes to

.fully taking advantage of college

life?

It is not difficult to obtain an ,

undergraduate degree at Pitt and at

#5} the same time make only a couple of

friends and never , really become
active in even one of the many
groups on campus. In fact, there are
students who spend so much time
each day worrying about where to
park at school, where to eat lunch
and how to beat rush hour on the
way home that they ‘never do any-
thing besides attend classes. There
are ways to solve this problem.
First, a commuter should recog-
nize that Pitt offers a diverse list of
opportunities for him and that the’
university only beneﬁts from the
commuter’s active participation in

its clubs and organizations. If a stu- '

dent needs some assistance in ﬁnd-
ing the organizations that would
best suit himiand would benefit from
his membership, he could -request
information from the Office of Stu-
dent Activities, New Student Pro-
grams or the Commuter
Association. The first contact that
all Pitt freshmen make with the over
100 clubs on campus isduring orien-
tation when they answer the Fresh-
man Interest Survey. The survey
should be completed carefully
because it could help place commu-
ters in organizations that they would
never ever think ofjoining.

The Freshmen Activities Fair dur-
ing late August is the first time dur-
ing the college career that a student

_By LYNN WEINBERG

- First off, I’d like to welcomeyou
to Pitt. Coming to a large university
such as this, there are a millionand
one things going on besides just
classes and studying, especially in
the beginning. One of the most
important and hardest things to do
is to set your priorities. After that’s
accomplished, there’s a lot offered
academically as well as socially. The
answer for someone else might not
be the answer for you.

 Opinion

can fully visualize his many oppor-
tunities on campus. It is not so much
the work a student does in a group,
which is important, but it is the
number of people a student can
come in contact with during college
that could really count.

It is easy to become involved with
the people at Pitt. The most conve-
nient way is to talk to classmates. A
new friendship could come from
sharing class notes or from studying
with other commuters for exams.

Why not read The Pitt News more

often? Not _only_will a commuter _

If a commuter who lives at home
with his family feels he is being
cheated out of the fun of college life,
he should change his environment.
Many times it is beneficial and
financially possible to share an
apartment off-campus with other

, commuters. Once separated from

their families, students have a
-chance to build more independence
and become more motivated to do
things with their peers.
Always remember not to give up
and make college life a routine.
Everyday_ at school will be worth the

know what is going on around the
campus but he will also know ifthere
are any activities during the week
that he would like to attend. In addi-
tion, there will be a “Commuter
Journal” sponsored by the Commu-
ter Association in The Pitt News at
least once a month.

Try alleviating some of the every-
day commuter pet peeves by sharing
them with other commuters. For
example, do not fight traffic alone.
Join the University student carpool
program, COMCAP, and get to
know other Pitt students in your
community.

If there is something that interests
you, no matter what it is, find out as
much as possible about itand pursue
it. Get involved as much as you can,
but not to the point of -neglecting
other things or not doing it to your
fullest potential. Another important
thing is not to be afraid, whether it’s
tojoin an organization or a group or
talking to a professor because you
don't understand something.

In entering my senior year and
looking back, doors have been
ope-ned to me that would have other-
wise been closed. l’ve seen my in-

effort of getting there for all commu-
ters if they make the university an
exciting place to be. Develop your
talents and share your interests now
while you have the opportunity to
do so. The University of Pittsburgh '
is a commuter’s school so do not feel
like you are in a minority if you com-
mute. A commuter controls his col-
lege life and he decides whether the
new inconveniences will overcome
the many possible advantages.

Be Involved And Enjoy

By MARK DOWNS

Welcome to Pitt!

Of all the endless avenues of
activity that will surround you in
the coming weeks, perhaps none
is more important than the activ-
ities presented by Pitt students.
Take a look around you. The stu-
dents that you see involved in the
numerous student organizations
and activities are learning valua-
ble skills—people skills—that
will enable them to make friends,
stay involved throughout their
four years at Pitt, and develop
into worthwhile citizens upon
graduation. This experience is
one that is sometimes oversha-
dowed by the academic side of
our institution.

But student activities present
wonderful opportunties for you
to learn about yourself and
about your fellow students.

I Through the interactions student

organizations provide, you may

develop as a person beyond the
academic growth you will expe-
rience in college. ' ’
The list of student groups and
organizations is nearly endless.
Whatever your interests include,
you are certain to find a student
group that enjoys the same thing.
Don't be shy when it comes to
“ meeting students through stu- .
dent activites! Ask questions of
the students you see involved.
Find out why they are doing
what they are doing. .
If you have specific questions,
about Pitt‘s student organiza‘-'_
tions and want speciﬁc answers
contact the Student Activities-‘
Office, Room 107, William Pitt
Union. The staff and directors
will be happy to answer any of
your questions concerning. their"
office and its success. Remem-

ment Board.) ‘

Academics & Activities .
Go Hand-In-Hand  I

By Dr. Larry Lunsford

Education was much in the news
over the summer. President Reagan
focused new attention on education
by supporting a master teacher's
plan whereby competence in teach-
ing would be rewarded. The Stan-
dard Achievement test (SAT) was
put to a court test in New Jersey and
came out on the winning side. Tui-
tion continued to rise at practically
all colleges and universities in the
country.

With a presidential election
approaching next year, education
could remain as a key issue among
the candidates. It certainly remains a

local and state issue every year.

around budget time. Pittsburgh city
schools cut its teacher numbers this
summer, andthe annual budget bat-
tle in Harrisburg saw Pennsylvania‘s
colleges and universities again

- among the least state-funded institu-

tions in the country.

There’s an old saying that Ann
Landers likes to quote: if you think
education is expensive, try ignor-
ance. Undoubtedly there is much
truth to the statement. The benefits
of a college education go unchal-
lenged, and that education goes
beyond what is taught in the
classroom. I

There is much learning that also
goes on outside the classroom
through one of .the many extra-
curricular activities made available
to students. On a campus as large as
that of Pitt, there is an activity to
meet the interests ofevery student. It
could be a political organization, a
religious group, a theatre club, a fra-
ternity or sorority, a sports team, a
student media organization, Stu-
dent Government Board, the Pitt
Program Council or one of a
hundred other groups on campus—-
there is something for everyone.

Activities outside the classroom
complement academics in several
ways. Such activities offer the stu-
dent the opportunity to meet other
students with similar interests.
There are many lcadership»oppor-
tunities available. through such
involvement. Regardless of the pro-
fession a student may seek following

curricular activities from the under-» .

graduate years will play an
important role in the interview
process. '

Graduate and professional school: .

interviewers as well as those in the
professional working world are
impressed with students‘ that not
only have excelled academically but
who haveiproven themselves capa-
ble of getting along well with others.

To be active in a campus organiza-

tion or organizations is demonstra-
tive of the ability to communicate
effectively and should prove benefi-
cial to a student’s future endeavors.

There is no ‘way that every aspect
of success personally and profes-
sionally can be taught in the typical

 

classroom setting. There is much’

that comes through interaction with
-others with bothsimiliar and dis-

- similiar views, backgrounds and

interests. Learning outside the class-

room is essential to the entire learn- 

ing process a student undergoes.

It is important for students to
realize the foremost reason for being
here is to attempt to excel] academi-
cally, but at the same’ time, they
should be aware that there are extras
that do exist to complement the
booking and testing. Check out the
many extra-curricular activities
available at Pitt and find a place for

. you! .

Everything From Soup To Nuts

Friendship, Fun All A Part of Greek Life

By TOBY TROSKY .
September is always a busy month
for Pitt's fraternities and
’sororities—it is the month of rush.
Sororities are busy talking about the
legacies who will be coming around
or possibly who will suicide when it
comes time to make a bid: Fraterni-
ties speculate whether the man who
decided to stay independent last year
will finally change his mind and
pledge.
’ All ofthis technical talk may leave
many people “out in the cold,” but it

really isn’t as complicated as it

seems.

Rush is simply the opportunity
for the fraternities and sororities to
familiarize themselves with-the other -
students and for the other students
to do the same.

“It’s an orientation -to Greek life,”
said Bridget Guernsey, Pitt’s Greek

adviser, “ a mutual familiarity.”

Rush really begins with summer
mailings, introducing the Greek Sys-
tem to new students.

The Watermelon Picnic, in which
both fraternities and sororities par-
ticipate, and Lantern Night, a
ceremony for the women, serve as
kick-off events for this year’s fall
rush. ’

Sorority rush is a series of parties
in which all sororities participate.
Rush counselors (women who are
already members of sororities) take
interested women around to the
individual sororities. This event is
called Open House, and its purpose
is to briefly introduce the rushees to
the sororities.

The rushees then go to eight part-
ies, then four and then two. It is a
mutual selection process, for both

the sororities and riishees to deter- _

     
    

        
   
     
     

mine who goes back to each
sorority.

After the “two-round”parties, it is
time for the rushee to determine
which sorority.she would like to
join. A bid, which is a formal invita-
tion to pledge a sorority, is then
issued. - .

Fraternity rush is lessistructured
than sorority rush, but basically it
works on the same principle. For
open rush, the men go to the frater-
nities on their own, afterppurchasing
a rush card. Closed rush then fol-
lows, where parties are by invitation
only.

Here are some brief definitions
which may make rushing a lot easier:

0 Bid—an invitation to member-
ship from a fraternity or sorority to a
rushee.

0 Rushee——A college man or
woman who isparticipating in rush.

I Alumna—-An initiated member
who graduated.

0 Legacy—A prospective member

~whose mother or sister was a
member of the particular sorority”

she is rushing.

0 Pledge—O,ne who has been
accepted as a member in a sorority
or fraternity. After learning all
about the fraternity or sorority, he
or she may become initiated as a
brother or sister.

0 lnitiation—The traditional’

ceremony which brings’ the pledge
into full membership of the frater-
nity or sorority. v

0 Independent—A person not a
member of a fraternity or sorority.

O Suicide——When a rushee only
attends one final party when invited
to two, or she attends both and only
lists one choice on her bid card.

0 Active——A full member ofa fra-
ternity or sorority.

 

 

Greeks come out in full force during home football games to show
their support for the Panthers.

Board Plans Upcoming Term

The start of Schenley Hall’s reno-
vation meant the beginning of three
years of uncertainty and madness
for student organizations housed in
the building. Now that the renova-
tion is completed, Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB) hopes to make
the facility, whatever name it may
carry, the focal point of student life
outside the classroom.

Student involvement at Pitt, espe-
cially on the part of the incoming
freshmen, will be student govern-
ment’s first priority as they enter
into the second half oftheir one-year
terms in office, according to SGB
president Mark Downs.

Student government will stage a
grand opening celebration ofits own
in early September, complete with
live music and food, in an attempt to
introduce students, new and old, to
the various campus groups with
which they can become involved.

As SGB president, Downs acts as
overseer and spokesman for the nine
member board, each of whom serves
on various university advisory
boards such as the University Senate
and Senate Council.

The current board and president
were among the 20 candiates that
ran for SGB office in last
November’s elections. Elections are
open to all undergraduates except
those enrolled in the College of Gen-
eral Studies.

The 1982-83 race was not without
its moments of controversy. Stu-
dents and faculty continued to pro-
test the annual barrage of
campaign-poster graffiti and one

board candidate got caught with her‘

hand in the ballotjar. Arpi Asdour-
ian resigned from the race on elec-
tion day after admitting knowledge
of the theft of ballots from a polling
location at Hillman Library. Pitt’s
Greeks followed tradition and con-
tinued to dominate the elections,
placing seven of their brothers and
sisters on the board and electing
Downs to the presidency, making
him the third Delta Tau Delta

' member to hold the office in the last

four years. Dan Lecce was the only
non-Greek elected. A little more
than 3,000 ballots were cast in the
presidental race out of a possible
voter population of over 12,000.

The election of Downs came as a
surprise to the many who felt his
lack of previous student goverment
experience made then-board
member Spencer Davis a sure
winner in the race for SGB presi-
dent. Downs nevertheless won con-
vincingly after campaigning on the
premise that leadership is more “a
style, not something that has to be
developed.”

After serving half of his term in
office, Downs thinks that style——a
mix of enthusiasm and delegation-

has allowed the board to do itsjob
more effectively.

“I have learned to let people do
things on their own,” Downs said. “I
have let the board come up with
ideas on its own so that it will be
enthusiastic and want to work
towards goals that it wants to
accomplish. I haven't tried to press

any goals upon the people of student ,‘-~

goverment.”

Some of the board's ideas include
the installation of benches at various
campus bus stops, the restoration of
the student assembly (a forum for
student discussion provided for in
the SGB constitution but which has
been extinct for the past few years)
and the formation of a LSAT (Law
School Admission Test) prep course
on campus.

The LSAT prep course, a project
of board member Mindy Goldberg
and the Academic Affairs Commit-

tee (one of eight standing commit-2,‘ "

tees), will begin this term for a
one-year trial run at Pitt. Goldberg,
the board and members of the Aca-
demic Affairs Committee poured
over course materials and bids sub-
mitted by a number of companies
before settling on the Shoemaker-
Kusko company of Allentown, Pa.

One local firm offering the LSAT
prep-course, Stanley H. Kaplan

Educational Centers, quoted a fig- ,

ure of $350 for the course, plus a
refundable $50 deposit on course
materials. The SGB-sponsored
course will cost students $100.
“The initial decision [was] that a
lot of Pitt students take the LSAT, a
lot of Pitt students take the prep
course, it is expensive and that we
should find a cheaper way,” Bill
Davis, chairman of the Academic
Affairs Committee said.
Shoemaker-Kusko will be pro-

vided with a free room in the student '5

union to conduct the course as well
as the various types of publicity
being planned by SGB including an .
information packet which has been
sent out to prospective students. The
course will be conducted over a five

“day period, September 18-25, for

those preparing to take the LSAT on
October 1.

Downs applauded Goldberg and
the others for bringing the LSAT
prep course to Pitt and called for
similar programs in the near future.

“We are not just trying to get these
courses for people who are inter-
ested in going to law school,” Downs
said. “In the coming months we
would like to build upon this and get
some other types of prep courses.”

“Davis thinks that if the LSAT
course can attract enough interest,
then other companies and other
courses can be brought on campus.
Many students, however, have
already committed themselves to
other LSAT prep courses for the
fall. ' *

“This course is not going to help
thousands of students, but the idea is
to start somewhere,” Davis said.
“We are hoping for 50 or more, but
we don’t know, we could have I00. It
all depends on how many students
have already committed themselves
to other companies.

“Someone called the pre-law’
office the other day and told me that
they had just put down a deposit to
take the LSAT prep course and I
told them to get their money back,
that they could save a couple of
hundred dollars.”

The SGB didn’t fare as well in the
battle with other student costs——
specifically tuition. Rising tuition
continued to be the unstoppable
force about which they could do“

nothing in its first half-year in office.
Tuition increases arrived on sche-
dule despite protests from student
govermerit and other student
organizations.

State appropriations to Pitt and
other state-related universities rose
by 4 percent for the fiscal year 1983-
84 but tuition increased by an aver-
age of 9.5 percent for Pitt students.

“It [the tuition increase] is really
such a complex subject that in the
book-keeping system of the univer-
sity, there would be no way for me to
make a comment as to whether the
money is being used wisely or
unwisely,” Downs said.

“It is my opinion, from what they
[university administrators] pres-
ented to me, that they are making
every effort to keep costs down to
the students. I think they are trying
to keep everything in line—-the qual-
ity of education that we get at Pitt
and the cost—and I think they are
doing a good job with that."

Cuts in programs also hit stu-
dents. The closing of the internship
office was announced in March by
Dr. Robert Gallagher of the Career
Counseling Center. However stu-
dents, faculty and university admin-
istrators
served an important function, espe-
cially during a period of high unem-
ployment.

Who is Who

Clinton Davis

agreed that the office’

Considered by those ade-
quately knowledgeable on the
subject of track and field to be
one of the best to ever travel on
scholastic tracks, Clinton Davis
will be attending Pitt in the fall.
However, the former Steel Val-
ley High School star from
Homestead will be far removed
from the Pitt track squad.

He will be training under the
watchful eyes of Elbert Kennedy
of the New Image Track Club.
Davis is doing so in preparation
for the 200- and 400-meter
sprints in the 1984 Olympic

Summer Games in Los Angeles.

Beyond that, Davis is likely to
grab a scholarship offer from a
school located in the West or
Southwest, both considered
king-sized track territories
amongst other pawns across the
nation.

Lifting Davis to such a status
is thefact that he is a two-time
PIAA champion and record
holder in the 100-, 200- and 400-
meter sprints and one-time
champ. in the 400-meter anchor
leg. In the 200 at Junior Nation-
als held at Penn State last June,
Davis set a record with a time of
20.29.

Tapping The Resources of Oakland Cuisine

If you're not in the mood for the
cafeteria’s chef surprise, Oakland
offers an abundance of alternatve
eating places. Those on a budget
can just walk down Forbes or Fifth
Avenue and there they are -- open
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Oakland can be known as Fast
Food Junkie Heaven. On Fifth
Avenue, there are Burger King and
Wendy's, located a block from one
another. Forbes Avenue features
McDonald's, Arby’s, Roy Ro-
ger's, The Original Oyster
House and Taco Vista, all within
walking distance from campus. Roy
Roger's also plans on opening a new
restaurant this week in the base-
ment of the Cathedral of Learning,
so if4you’re in between classes and
can’t hold out for lunch, that will
offer a haven for the hungry.

Corky’s on Fifth Avenue is a uni-
que pizza shop. It is also considered
one of the area’s more classy (but
not expensive)‘ quick-eating places.
The cuisine includes thick pan pizza
either by the slice or by the pie and a
magnificent salad bar, which, in
addition to the usual, has such
‘things as fresh fruit, sunflower seeds
and other edibles uncommon on
other salad bars. The restaurant
also plays'MTV during dinner hours
and sports events on Sundays. Cor-
ky’s just recently received a liquor

license, so if you like beer or wine
with your pizza, this might just be
the place for you.

Some say The Original Hotdog
Shop, affectionately known as the
“O,” is ina class by itself. The “O”
features foot-long hot "dogs with a
wide assortment of toppings, french
fries, pizza, ice cream and a variety
of'hero sandwiches.

Fatso’s, a New York-style deli
located on Forbes Avenue, offers
mainly reasonably priced sand-
wiches, and patrons can choose the

_fixings and type of bread. In addi-

tion, Fatso’s has french fries with
several cheese toppings, and a var-
iety of desserts. They also deliver.

Freshmen will soon discover that
midnight pizza-eating is a part of col-
lege life, and pizzas are there for the
pickin’ in Oakland. Sorrento’s is on
Atwood Street; Capri is located on
Forbes Avenue; Napoli and Little
Italy are on Fifth Avenue.

Farther from campus are Mother
John's and Domino’s pizzarias in
North Oakland. Most of the area
pizza places deliver on campus at no
additional cost, and the majority of
them have specials during finals, so
students can shop around while
they are studying.

Blimpie’s on Forbes Avenue-and
Subway on Oakland -Avenue both
feature hoagies and hero sand-

wiches. They are reasonably priced

and offer both sit down and take-out
service. I

If you have some extra money or
the parents come to visit, you might
want to take a break from fast food
and treat yourself to_ something bet-
ter.

Closest to the dorms is Gus-
tine’s Restaurant. Gustine’s
serves sandwiches, snacks and full
dinners. The prices are moderate
and the atmosphere is quiet. Next to
Gustine’s is C.J.‘Barney’s, which
has basically thesame menu with a
few extras. C.J.’s specialties are its
French onion soup and fried provo-
lone sticks. They havealso added a
Mexican menu and have a wide var-
iety of hamburgers and sandwiches.
C.J.’s prices are moderate.

Nino’s Restaurant on North
Craig Street serves strictly Italian
and is moderate to expensive. This
is a nice place to take your parents
since. they have valet service and a
nice, uncollege-like atmosphere.

On South Craig Street, there is
the Scandia Bord, where you can
get a sandwich on a croissant for
lunch while looking at the chic shops
on the street. Also on South Craig is
the more expensive Cafe Azure.
This restaurant is mainly French
with a different quiche and a differ-
ent seafood dish everyday. The res-
taurant has indoor and outdoor
seating.

Dieters and slaladlovers can feast

right on campus at the Second
Plate, which is located on the
second ﬂoor of Forbes Quadrangle.
The Second Plate has a variety of
salads,'salads in pita bread and
soups at moderate to expensive
prices. ‘

Students who like vegetarian and
natural foods and wish to spend a
little money, will find top-quality
food at the Cornucopia on Atwood
Street. This restaurant features
such items-as vegetarian lasagne,
special natural sandwiches and
salads. .

An alternative to Sunday brunch
in the Pitt cafeteria can be found at
Rebeccals Place located in the
University Inn. The restaurant has
buffet-style brunches on Saturdays
prior to home football games and on
Sundays, in addition to its moder-
ately priced cuisine the rest of the
week.

Angel’s Corner on Atwood
Street in South Oakland offers a
variety of seafood dishes at moder-
ate to expensive prices.

While Oakland is a melting pot for
people of many different back-
grounds and nationalities, there are
a variety of restaurants that serve
non-traditional American foods.
The Black Angus on Atwood
Street serves many intercontinental
foods in addition to steak and other

meat meals. . The prices ‘range from,’

inexpensive to expensive and they ‘ I
-have an early bird dinner special. '

My Place on Oakland Avenue
offers basic American sandwiches
such as fish and bacon, lettuce and
tomato, but also boasts about its
gyros and spinach rolls. The prices
are comparatively inexpensive.

Chinese food can be found at
inexpensive to moderate prices at
the Bamboo Garden on Forbes
Avenue and the House of Chiang
on McKee Place.

The Taj Restaurant on Oakland
Avenue has inexpensive Indian
food, such as beef and chicken
curry, plus a choice of vegetarian
delicacies. The Babylon Restau-
rant on Atwood Street serves inex-
pensive Syrian food.

Following lunch or dinner, stu-
dents might- want some dessert.
Oakland’s ice cream parlors include
Baskin-Robbins on Atwood Street
and North Craig Street and the new
Pace’s Ice Creamery on South
Craig Street, which is a little expen-
sive. Doughnuts can be bought
’round-the-clock at Mister Donut
on Forbes Avenue.

So when the cafeteria food just

‘doesn’t hit the spot, or you’re in

between classes and want to eat
lunch out, there is a wide choice of
good foods just a few blocks away

from campus.'_, I. .   .

I Entertain

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

New Pitt students often find that
bar-hopping is as big a part of col-
lege life as classes themselves. Bars
can be good places to meet fellow
students or get to know people
familiar from class or the dorms.

Oakland is plentiful with night-
spots, but freshmen should be
reminded that the drinking age in
Pennsylvania is 21, so many of you
will be unable to visit the bars. For
older students, the local bars do
card, so proof of age should be on
hand. The bars in the area accept
Pennsylvania picture drivers’
licenses and LCB cards as ID.

Bars provide a fresh alternative to
fraternity and dorm parties, at

which liquor will be restricted more

heavily this year than previously.

There are several bars on Oak-
land’s main drag—Forbes Avenue.
Less than a block from campus is
Gustine’s, which was formerly
owned by Pittsburgh Pirate Frank
Gustine. The bar was sold last
spring and was recently remodeled.
Gustine’s serves an older, mellow
crowd, and is the site of the English
department’s weekly Reading Ser-
ies every’ Tuesday night.

Two doors from Gustine’s is The
Wooden Keg, which has an
upstairs and- a downstairs bar. The
Keg features a Beer Blast on Thurs-
days from 9.p.m. to midnight. It also
has a Friday happy hour with special
prices on beer and mixed drinks,
and members of the Greek system
are often in attendance.

Formerly known as Upstairs at
Mr; C’s, Upstage is also located on
Forbes Avenue. Billed as an enter-
tainment lounge, Upstage features

It’s nine o’clock on Saturday
morning. You take a shower, go to
brunch...then what? The football
team is away this week, you don’t
have to work today and you don’t
have ‘anything to do until tonight.
You could study, but why do that on
Saturday afternoon?

If you don’t know what to do with

your Saturdays, or any other free’

time, don’t despair! There’s enough
activity in and around Oakland to
keep you busy all year!

The Pitt Program Council (PPC)'
has plans for a busy fall. It’s sponsor-
ing several coffeehouses, featuring
local performers like Billy Price and
The Core. The PPC also runs
movies at David Lawrence Hall for
$1 for students with validated IDs
and $2 for non-students.

The movies this fall include brand
new films, like Sophie’s Choice, The
Verdict and Tootsie, as well as some
old favorites, such as _West Side
Story and Clockwork Orange. The
PPC will also schedule some con-
certs and lectures. '

Movie buffs will have a field day at
the Pittsburgh Playhouse on Craft
Avenue, just off of Fifth Avenue, a
few blocks from Pitt. A variety of
movies is shown at the Playhouse

for $2.75.admission. Movie listings‘

are available around campus.

, The Playhouse professional
action company is gearing up for
four plays this year, including “The
Little Foxes” and “The 1940’s Radio
Hour.”

Although Rocky Horror fans no
longer congregate at their Friday
and Saturday‘ night rituals, the

to do a lot of business with the col-
lege crowd.

Further down the street is the
Forbes Studio, from which Pitts-
burgh radio station WAMO broad-

Forbes Studio focuses on disco
dancing and has been a popular spot
for students since it opened last
winter. .

Closer to campus are several
other much-frequented bars. Dan-
ny’s Pub on Oakland Avenue has a
good mix of college students and
locals. Danny’s features live ‘Irish
music on Tuesday nights and runs a

at both its -upstairs and downstairs
bars. This is also the most popular
bar in Oakland every St. Patrick’s

Happy hour at Danny’s is 4'to 7
p.m. Monday through Friday, when
liquor and beer are sold at reduced

' prices. A disc jockey plays popular

music on Wednesdays and week-
ends, and the bar claims an ultra-
electronic juke box among its
oddities. I

Also on Oakland Avenue is
Peter’s Pub, a two-room hang-out
for many Pitt students. A DJ. spins
records at Peter’s every night but

College students tend to get into
the habit. of thinking that culture

Unlike other Oakland bars, the Pitt
Tavern caters to a quiet crowd,
usually consisting mainly of profes-
sionals and neighborhood regulars.
This is also the most popular bars
following home football games
because it‘ is the first bar one hits
after descending Cardiac Hill.

Deep in the heart of South Oak- .

land are the SOD and Sam and
Bernie's, both’ on Semple Street.
The bars have no real specials and
mainly cater to the South Oakland
residents. .
With its homey, rustic .atmos-

. phere, Denny’s on Louisa Street is

Oakland's answer to a true neigh-
borhood bar. Among the attractions
at Denny’s is a large aquarium ﬁlled
with tropical and rare fish.
Denny’s runs a Beer Blast every
Wednesday night and happy hour is
Mondays through Thursdays from 4
to 7 p.m. The owner plans to start
live entertainment, and there will be
various specials for football games.
A little off the beaten path are
three bars in North Oakland worth a
visit. Mitchell’s, a one-room bar on

 

Centre Avenue, has reducedidraft

,. specials on Monday and Thursday
nights. Mitchell’s clientle ranges ‘

from locals to fraternity members.

After being closed for several
months, many students don’t even

rant is open. Located at the comer
of Centre and Craig, the Luna has-a

Thirsty’s, across the street from '

rtainment at Thirsty’s, and regular

specials include a Monday night
Beer Blast. Tuesdays are, Nurses’

your schedule isn’t too full. I

Like most, schools, Pitt has a
language all its own. If you want
to make your life at Pitt easier
and be able to move from place
to place without" much hassle,
you’ll have to learn certain terms
that pertain to the university and
its surrounding areas. The fol-
lowing is a list of terms that might
be of help to you during your firs
few weeks of school: ‘

The “O” — You'll probably
learn more from this place at 2
a.m. on a Sunday morning than
you’ll learn from all four of your
years at Pitt. The only education
you’ll get from the “Dirty O,”
however, is how to comparison
shop for beer and how to keep
down greasy hot dogs and
french fries. In addition to these,
The “O” gives you a chance to
-enrich your vocabulary with a
whole new list of four letter
words.

The Quad — When you hear
this term, people are probably
referring to Schenley» Quad,
although they might mean
Forbes Quad. Be wary of inani-
mate objects falling from the sky
when you walk through this
area.

, Schenley Hall — Although the
name of the student union will be
changed to the William Pitt
Union, there will undoubtedly be
some people who will refuse to
break from the past and will con-
tinue to call the building Schen-
ley Hall. Don’t pity these poor
people, just call them “keepers
of history.”

Greeks — This is the nick-
name for the people you will see
on campus wearing funny letters
on their hats, sweatshirts, T-
shirts, etc. Greeks have been
known to do all sorts of degrad-
ing things in the name of charity.

A Crash Course
In Pittese

They are members of fraternities
or sororities.

Uncle Wes — This isthe man
who watches over us at all times ‘
— Chancellor Wesley Posvar,
also known as Big Brother.

The Towers — These are the
large, round buildings that peo-
ple live in. You can’t miss them,
there are three of them. They are
officially known as the Litchfield
Towers, named after a former
chancellor. Students who live
here can really say they have
their own piece of the pie.

Trees — No, this isn’t those
green things you see in front of
the newly-renovated student
union. Trees is actually a recrea-
tional facility located somewhere
up there. This is also a good
excuse to use when you’re late
for class: “But, professor, I just
came from a class at Trees."

Cardiac Hill — Leading up to
Pitt Stadium, Cardiac Hill
(DeSoto Street) is Pitt’s answer
to aerobics. It has been known to
start, as well asstop, many a
heart. If you smoke, forget about
attending any home football
games unless you have your own .
CPR unit standing by.

Thackery Hall — This is the
former Mervis Hall, but.the new
Mervis Hall is the new business
school, behind the not-so-new
Forbes Quad, which was for-

merly known as Forbes Field. .

Thackery, or Mervis as some still
call it, houses the Registrar's and‘
Cashier’s Offices formerly
housed in G"-17 on the ground
ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

'RAs — Your mother, father,
sister and brother for- the next
four years. These RAs are under
the direction of the RDs, who are

Mnrsh pfnb

By "was cornea

Pitt’s dorms offer many advan-
tages to residents over commu-
ters or off-campus residents, but
there are also many headaches
that accompany being part of a
large college system.

Oncampus residents can turn
to three offices to help iron out
difficulties that may arise. They
are: the University Housing

Office, the Office of Resi- 7

dence Life (ORL) and the
Resident Student Associa-
tion (RSA).

The University Housing Office

, takes care of most of the practi-

cal problems a student may
have, such as ID cards, assign-
ments, laundry facilities, meals
and maintenance. The office also
handles problems with tele-
phones, mail and anything that
may be wrong with the room.
Students will find they cannot
get far at Pitt without their ID
cards. Pam Bogos, administra-
tive assistant at the Housing
Office, said freshmen who have

attended a summer orientation A_

will receive ID cards right away,
but those who did not must go to
the Food Service Office in the

Towers Lobby and get their pic- ,
ture taken for their permanent-

ID cards.

Freshmen have their choice of
10, 14 or 19 meals in the cafeteria
per week. Information about
which meal plan has been
chosen is on the ID card, and the
Housing Office also takes care of
this. ‘

The Housing Office also is
responsible for other necessi-
ties, such as
laundry room, in the lobby of
Tower C, is available to students
from each Tower.

The Office of Residence Life is
concerned with-the education‘,
social, safety and health pro-

laundry. The ,

grams of the oncampus student.

The ORL coordinates the
Resident Assistants (RAs)
and the Resident Directors
(RDs). There is one RA per ﬂoor
per dorm, and according to ORL
assistant director Brenda
Zgorac, the ration of students to
RAs is 50 to one.

The RA is there to help the
student in case of crisis or con-
ﬂict, as well as to plan activities
so that studentson the floor can

’ get to know one another.

John Murrey, a sophmore
who lives in the Towers, said his
RA was a big help when it came
to meeting other students
through activities like “football
games with the guys.”

“My RA was ‘pretty good at
keeping quiet hours,” Murrey
said. “It helps ,a lot when you’re
trying to study in your room.”

Pitt dormitories have visiting
rules that must be obeyed by the
student and the student's visitor.
An overnight guest of the same
sex must register with the desk
attendant, and the roommate’s
signature is needed for approval
for overnight guests on week-
days. - , A
Visiting members of the oppo-
site sex must be out of the dorm
room by 2 a.m. Sunday through
Thursday, but anyone can stay
all night over the weekend.

Carolyn Shearer, a senior who
has lived in an all-girls dorm for
three years, -said she doesn’t

- mind the visiting restrictions too

much. , .
“The visiting hours are
reasonable,” she said. “It’s only
courteous to your roommate.”
Another aspect of visiting at
the Pitt dorms is the signing-in
process. Visitors must present
some form of identification
before they are permitted in the
building. It can present a hassle
at certain times, but the process

has its advantages.

“I guess it’s good to question
people so there aren’t crazies
running around where you live,”
Murrey said.

The signing-in process is mon-
itored 24 hours a day by desk
attendants who enforce the vis-
itation policy and watch who
goes in and out of each building.
Both the Housing Office and the
Office of Residence Life are
responsible for some of the desk
attendants, some of whom are
students. Desk attendants
require that residents show their
ID before entering the dorms.

Residence life has its pros and
cons. Shearer said the worst
part of dorm life is not having
your own bathroom, while Mur-
rey’s biggest complaints concern’
the lack of privacy and noise.

Despite the disadvantages,
most students find that they can
meet people more easily by living
on campus.

The RSA tries to help the
4,500 students who live on cam-
pus, and according to RSA presi-
dent Allen Grossman, this
organization works as a liaison
between resident students and
the administration.

In addition to handling prob-
lems faced in the dorms, the
RSA plans activities such as pic-
nics, a haunted house every Hal-
loween and the annual Spring
when students get
together to celebrate spring by
playing games and listening to
music as well as variouisiother
activities. ,

Grossman said one of the big-
gest problems freshmen face is
adjusting to Pitt and to dormi-
tory life. The RSA tries to help
with the adjustment through
programs such as rollerskating
in Schenley Quadrangle,‘ where
they can meet each other and
“get involved in college life.”

The administration has been
spending .a great deal of time on
the issue of alcohol in the dorms
since the tragic death of Pitt foot-
ball player Todd Becker last
December. Becker fell from a
dormitory window during a party
at which alchohol was being
served.

A new alcohol policy is
expected to be released soon,
but for now, one must be 21 to
bring alcohol into the dorms. \

A few notes that could help
alleviate problems during the
first few days in the dorms:

Telephones: Your phone
should already be working when
you enter your _room. lfit isn't,

there’s probably a problem, and"
. the unit can be fixed by calling

91-611. If you’re making a call on
campus, only the last four digits
of the number need to be dialed
since the university exchange is
624. If you’re making a call off
campus, however, you must dial
91 plus the other seven digits.

Your first phone bill will be

mailed to your dorm address one
month after your phone has
been in operation. ..

Mail: Your mail box number
was written on your housing
contract. You can find mail

A boxes in the Towers Lobby and

start checking for mail from

. home right away.

Use the following address to
have letters sent to you:

Name

Box Number .

3990 Fifth Avenue

Pittsburgh, Pa. 15213

Laundry: You will soon learn

that laundry rooms get crowded,
so most experienced residents
do their wash as late as possible
so they can get a A machine.
Washing machines cost $.35 per
load, and dryers cost $.30. In
dorms other than the Towers,
laundry rooms are located on
the eleventh floor or on the stu-
dent’s ﬂoor.

While living in the dormitories

doesn’t have the advantages of‘

living at home, such as less con-
fusion and home cooking, you’ll
find" that dormitories are often

In every major university there
is bound to be a maze of people
and titles that make up the
administration, and Pitt is no
exception.

In charge of Pitt, on a large
scale, is Board of Trustees, which
consists of 36 voting members
and is headed by Westinghouse
executive Robert E. Kirby. The

board is in charge of any major I

changes made in the university
such as tuition hikes and installa-
tion on new programs.

The man directly responsible
for running Pitt is Chancellor
Wesley Posvar. The chancellor
operates the university like a
mayor runs a large city or an
executive manages a company.
He supervises university man-

_ agement on every level, from

finances to public relations. He
appoints deans and faculty
members and grants tenure.

The chancellor is also in
charge of securing resources to
fund various university pro-
grams or special projects. This
includes an annual trip to Harris-
burg to make a pitch to the legis-
lature for increased appropria-
tions.

Delegation is another function
of the chancellor. Posvar‘s
seconds-in-command are Jack
Freeman, senior vice-chancellor

for administration, the provost, I

who has not been appointed fol-
lowing the retirement of Rhoten
Smith, Bernard Kobosky, senior
vice-chancellor for public affairs,
and Nathan Stark, senior vice-
chancellor for the health
1 services.

Freeman is the chief adminis- '

trative, financial and planning
officer of the univeristy. He
advises and reports to the chan-
cellor on these matters. He is also
in charge of student affairs,

Ted Windt

Professor Ted Windt is known
in some circles as the man who
really authored The Book of
Lists. Lists are his livelihood.

Windt teaches a course called
Presidential Rhetoric, as well as
others, and has quite a large
number of groupies. Some peo-
ple actually clap for him when he
walks into a classroom. »

Windt’s Pres Rhet course is
one of the most popular classes
at Pitt and fills up quickly once
registration begins. If you have
room in your schedule sign up
for this course and learn “Every-
thing You Ever Wanted to Know

athletics, the computer center
and other areas.

The provost is assigned to
keep report cards on the aca-
demic progress of the entire uni-
versity. He is the principal
academic officer at Pitt, meaning
that he oversees academic pro-
grams and progress for over
34,000 students.

The chancellor’s third admi-
nistrative hand is Nathan Stark.
In his position as senior vice-
chancellor for the health scien-
ces, Stark is the link between

 

Pitt’s health sciences schools and
the University Health Center of
Pittsburgh, which includes Falk
Library and the Western Psychi-
atric Institute and Clinic.

Bernard Kobosky is Posvar’s
link with the public. He handles
any matters within the university
that have some impact on the
outside community and the city.
Kobosky works often with the
local media.

The chancellor also has a list
of assistants that deal directly
with his office. Katrina Veeder
Schulhof is the executive assist-
ant to the chancellor. Edward
McCord is the new assistant to

Page 21

the chancellor for academic
affairs. Maryann Bishop-Coffey
is the assistant to the chancellor
in regards to affirmative action
and Helen Knox is the assistant
to the chancellor in the area of
public relations.

There are

four vice-

chancellors that report directly
to Freeman. Joseph Dutton is
the vice-chancellor for business
and finance. He handles different
phases of the university’s finan-
cial obligations including the
payroll and registrar depart-

Most fees that students pay at Pitt
are more or less self-explanatory
such as tuition, board and meal
plans. But there are ambiguous fees
that students pay that are tougher to
explain — such as the $30 health fee
and the $24 student activity fee.

Don’t feel stupid if you’rc bewil-
dered about what these fees pay for.
Both the health and the student
activity fees have been subject to a
lot of questions and controversy.

The health feeis mandatory for all
undergraduates and graduate stu-
dents, and part-time students have
the option of paying the fee or pay-
ing for services rendered.

Students in the College of General
Studies “can’t take it [the fee] even if
they wanted to,” according to Frank
Carter, director of the student health
center. They must pay for services.

Services covered by the fee
include general medicine by one of
the health center’s three full-time
general practitioners, eight nurses or
three nurse practitioners. Students
can walk into the health center,
which is located in Brackenridge
Hall, or set up an appointment
ahead of time.

A specialist can diagnose and
treat an internal problem three days
a week, a dermatologist is available
two days a week. Some surgery is
also covered by the health fee. Stu-
dents are sent to the Falk Clinic,
where three surgeons are available
for services such as removing a mole
or ingrown toenail or providing a
second opinion.

Allergy shots, pregnancy testing
and immunizations are also pro-
vided by the health center. Some
necessary X—rays and lab work per-
formed outside of the health center
is covered when authorized by a stu-
dent health physician. - ,

Family planning and gynecologi-
cal services are done five days a week

The Pitt News, Orientation Issue, Sunday August 28, 1983

Where Does Student Fee Money Go?

in the new Forbes Clinic, located in
Forbes Hall.

The student health center is “self-
supporting” by the health fees, Car-
ter said, and its budget runs “slightly
over $1 million a year.”

“It works the way any other
department in the university does,”
he said, “except there is certain
money that funds this, whereas
other departments come out of the
general fund."

At Carnegie-Mellon University,
money for the health center comes
from a general fund. The health fee
there is incorporated into tuition,
and students have the services of
nurses from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on
weekdays, and physicians hold
limited office hours.

A “proﬁt” of $15,000 a year is
made from the Pitt pharmacy, which
is run by the School of Pharmacy
and is located in the health center.
Since students are able to get clinic
rates, drugs at the pharmacy are a
little less expensive than at most
drug stores, according to Carter,
and they can pay a reduced rate for
birth control.

The health center receives no out-
side revenue on a regular basis, but it
is always looking for extra profits
that can be funded through outside
sources.

One such project is a series of
eight films produced by the health
center, available for use by groups,
individuals and classes. This project
was financed through a grant by the
Metropolitan Life Foundation.

A major project that was financed
by the health center is Forbes Clinic,
which provides gynecological and
family planning services. The
$I25,000 to renovate that part of
Forbes Hall was borrowed from the
university and will be paid back over
four years, as it will be budgeted in
with the health center expenditures.

One common complaint about
the health center is that if a student

1111“

gets sick between 10:30 p.m. and 8
a.m. on weekdays, the services are
not available, and hence the $30 is
wasted.

“Your only alternative is to go to
the hospital," Carter said. “If you
were at home at I a.m., you proba-
bly couldn’t get your physician, any-
way. You'd have to go to a hospital
emergency room."

Carter said the number of stu-
dents seen by the university para-
medics, or P-Maps, during
off-hours indicates it would not be
cost-effective to keep the student
health center open 24 hours.

\‘§///I //I ; T?’

For students who want added
coverage, a $160-a-year student
health insurance plan will cover “the
bulk of their needs” by helping to
supplement bills of those who are
covered by Blue Cross or are not
covered at all. Seventeen hundred to
2,000 plans are sold a year, Carter
said.

‘‘It means that students are not
going to be wiped out if they have to
go to the hospital,” he said.

The university collects $565,000 in
student activities fees from ‘under-
graduates every year. Graduate stu-
dents pay $2 in the fall and $1 in the
winter term. Full-time CGS students
pay $7, and part-time CGS students
pay a $4 fee.

Joyce Giangarlo, assistant direc-
tor of student activities, admitted
that many students do not have any
idea where their money goes.

Thirty-five percent of the revenue
from the fee goes to the Pitt Pro-
gram Council, and I5 percent goes
to the student media, which includes
The Pitt News. The remaining half is
allocated by the Student Govern-
ment Board.

“At that point, it's [paying for] the
cost of entertainment, anything you
read and the cost of organizations,”
Giangarlo said. I

The allocations committee of the
SGB distributes the rest of the
money to various student organiza-
tions. The fact that most students
don’t know everything paid for by
the student activity fee is “a prob-
lem," according to Steve Smith,
head of the allocations committee.

There have been complaints by
some student organizations that the
fee will have to be raised in_order to
meet the cost of activities. For exam-
ple, last year the group Masada
requested $3,000 for a Purim party
and wine and cheese party during
Israel Week. The request was denied
by the committee.

“People complain they don’t get
all they need,” Smith said. “I think if
those organizations were put in our
position, they’d do the same thing
we do. We go by the policylthat ifit’s
a good program, we’re willing to
fund it."

Smith said he does not believe the
fee will have to be raised in the next
couple of years. Although they bud-
geted 103 percent of the money they
had to work with, some organiza-
tions will give money back they
haven’t_ spent.

One group that isn’t complaining
is the Black Action Society.

“I think [the fee] is adequate at
this point,” BAS adviser Jim Ray-
mond said. “They [SGB] seem to
have enough money to work with
this year.” _

Giangarlo, however, said she does
not believe the fee will be adequate
in the near future.

“In lieu of the way prices escalate
nationally, I would think that in the
next couple years it will become
necessary to raise the fee if we want
to continue to offer programs at the
same level we're doing now,” she
said.

“At some point, we’re either going
to be allocating less money or we’re
going to have to ask for more
money.” i .

In the meantime, students are
advised to be aware of just what
they're paying for with their health
and student activity fees.

Whois Who
Andy Smith

The renovation of the student
union just didn’t occur over
night. There was a brave man
who toiled over blueprints for
months, prayed that the grass
would grow on the grounds and
virtually lived and breathed ren-
ovation over the last two years.
That brave man was Andy
Smith, the director of student
activities.

Smith gave birth to the reno-
vation, so to speak, and watched
it blossom into a real student
union. Student groups in the
building had to put‘ up with
Smith's constant search for pen-
cil marks on the walls, cigarette
butts on the floor and any sign of
property abuse.

No, the building will not be
named the Andy Smith Student
Union, but Smith’s presence in
the building willbe felt long after
he’s gone.

Who is Who '

Wesley Posvar

Wesley W. Posvar is the man
who tries to hold Pitt together.

He has been chancellor of the
university for 15 years and is usu-
ally the brunt of most of the jokes
that float around campus.
Unfortunately, he rarely ven-
tures out from his office on the
first floor of the Cathedral to
hear what’s being said about
him. .

Chancellor Posvar will be the
man who shakes your hand dur-
ing the Freshman Picnic and
warmly welcomes you to the uni-
versity. That one brief moment
will probably be the only time in
your four years that you actually
see the man in person, unless you
decide to attend on of the many
meetings the administration
holds.

‘Cutting Through A :   “  
Pitt’s Red Tape   ﬁgs» Labor DQI

There has yet to be a University of Pittsburgh student who in four years of
college has not experienced some problem, whether it be personal, aca-
demic or career-oriented. Like any other major university, Pitt does have it _. 9

__share of red tape, but there are places freshmen can go if theyare having 4
problems and need answers. ‘

The Student Aid and Student Accounts Offices are probably the most
frequented offices on campus. The Student Aid Office (X5767) is on the
second floor of Bruce Hall and helps people who are either applying for
financial aid or are having problems receiving their aid. The Student
Accounts Office (X6085) is in Thackery Hall and deals with problems one
might have once he has received his tuition bill. I «

Also in Thackery Hall are two offices that all freshmen will be quite ’ ‘ - _
accustomed to by the time they leave Pitt. On the ground floor of the _  '
building is the Registrar’s Office and the Cashier’s Office. The Registrar’s - '

Office is where students register, add/ drop and withdraw from classes. The ' ' I
Cashier’s Office is the place where students pay their tuition bills, housing ..   ..~:-  '
fees and any other fee that has to do with the university. Both offices are » t _   - I '_ ' -
usually crowded, so give yourself plenty of time when you plan to make a trip ' ’ ‘ ‘ I" ' - I
‘here. ‘ A

‘.7! On the third ﬂoorof the student union are a bunch of offices that deal '
primarily with student’s problems in a wide range of topics. There _is the
Counseling Center (x5804) that attempts to help students who are having
problems with their careers, their finances or personal problems.

Also on that floor is the Career Development Program and the Career
Library (X5804). The Career Library offers literature about certain careers
to help students design their course of study at Pitt.

The Learning Skills Center (X5481) helps students who are having prob-
lems with their school work. It offers tips on how to. study and other things
related to a student’s academic career. Thelnternship Office (X3498) has a
whole list of companies that are looking for students to work for them. The

usually find one that isparallel to their course of study.

The Placement Center, on thesecond floor of the student union, is
actually several offices. The Placement Office~~(x5752) caters mainly to
graduating students. It arranges interviews between graduating seniors and
various companies from around the country. ,

The Student Employment Office (x5752) deals with students who are

. seeking part-time and summer employment. Students must register with
this office if they wantto be considered for employment. There is a listing of
job opportunities on a board outside the office that is categorized by
numbers. If a student finds a job he is interested in, he should get the number
and go to the counselor in the employment office to get the details. This

‘X office also gives typing tests for jobs that require typing.

Also on the second floor is the Health Professions Advising Office (X3514)
for students who are in the health professions.

The Student Health Office is another department that students‘ will
probably visit at" least once in four years. The clinic is on the first floor of
Brackenridge Hall. It is run like a clinic‘, so students can expect to wait, even
if an appointment is made, which is advisable. The Student Health! Office‘
also has a pharmacy, a family planning clinic, a health education program 5.
and a stress clinic. All the offices are located in Brackenridge or Holland 
Halls. 

There are also places to go that deal with specific problems. The Vete- 
ran’s Office (X6500), on the seventh floor of the student union, helps‘
veterans who are having problems with financial aid or adjusting to college
life. ’ ’

(X4114), attempts to alleviate the‘ off-campus housing problems that some,-
times face students. They have listings of apartments in the Oakland,
Shadyside and Squirrel Hill areas. They also have a roommate guide for
students who already have an apartment but are looking for roommates.
Finally, there is a number that all students should know--that of the
Department of Public Safety (or the Campus Police). Located on the ground
floor of Forbes Quadrangle, the office number is X4040 and the emergency
number is X2121. Students will notice orange boxes placed around campus
that can be used if an emergency occurs and no telephone is available.
All of the offices and services listed above are for the benefit of the student - ‘
and most are offered free of charge. Use these offices whenever a problem   ,
occurs, and your four years at Pitt might be a little easier. '

— ‘Roar Of The Greasepaint’:

By MARIA BARBUTO

jg‘ \ For an alternative to soppy, stan-

dard musical theater productions, see
the Robert Morris Colonial Theatre's
production of The Roar Of The
Greasepaint—The Smell Of The Crowd;
weekends through Sept. 3 on the
Robert Morris Campus in Coraopo-
lis. The cast includes students from
Pitt, Robert Morris, Point Park and
Chatham Colleges, as well as profes-
sionals from the Pittsburgh area.

  
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
    
 
 
  
 
   

by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bri-

cusse and produced in London in
1965. But director Melanie Smith has
injected the musical score ‘with a shot
of reggae, Devo-like punk and elec-
tric sounds to snag modern ears.
She's also modernized the script with
a unique stage set concept that em-
phasizes and enlarges the power

Originally, the show was written V

 

things like religion, rules and moral-
ity. Dunmire plays the sod with such
naivete that Sir actually begins to
look more like a pragmatic business-
man than a venemous swine. How-

ever, this is probably due to Cupples’ A

excessive charm and maniacally woo-
ing way.

Her part interjects a hard-edged real-
ism to/make Sir look a little less con-
genial. Instead of sighing and
nodding ”that’s the way it is,” the
audience feels a tinge of uneasiness
and hopes the play will offer some
form of idealistic redemption. And, of
course, it does. The intrusion of the
Black (Lamont Arnold) suggests a
new beginning and a turn from the
encroached, regimented existence
manually controlled by the satanic
Sir. Once Cocky allows the idea to
grip him, he reaches within himself
and is finally able to confront the vil-
lain by seeing the shallowness of the
shadow life he created.

phen King's The Stand is well
acquainted with the sham value sys-
tems nurtured by mechanistic heath-

the showvand reinforced with the use.

of contemporary music to add an apo-
calyptic feel. The entrance of the out-
side characters-—that is,those not

underground crowd—is doubly
important because they show that

structures can collapse if people unite

contemporary music work together
to make a thought-provoking coher-
ent whole that hits hard.

The subway station is peopled with ‘V

a bland smattering of ”Urchins”——a
sort of limbo of the lost cast that
observes the continual contest
between Sir and Cocky'and sides with
whomever is winning at the time.
The ensembles includes John
Mumper, Fern Pedano, Thom
McLaughlin, Lisa Martino, Wendy
Held, Cece Donoghue, Ellen New-
man and Janie Donoghue and fea-

tures a mime routine by Mumper and
several intricate dance numbers, par-
ticularly in the reggae number,
”What a Man” and some of the punk-
ish numbers.

Throughout, the music is good-
upbeat with only a few ballads
thrown in to slow the show down. It
is- fast-paced and uptempo, adding to
the thrill of the game and competi-
tion. Lamont Arnold's song,"’I Feel
Good,” is a particularly interesting
bluesy, jazzy piece. As expected, John
Dunmire has several impressive
numbers and his voice is especially
gritty and gripping in the electric
”The Joker.” Melanie Smith also
choreographed, adding jerky head
snaps to the new wave music and
calypso steps to the reggae. Interest-A
ing appearances are made by Eilleen

the Bully.

All in all, Greasepaint is a uniquely
enjoyable musical with a talented cast
that manages to say something and
entertain an audience at the same
time.

GOLDEN BOY: THE UNTOLD '

STORY OF WILLIAM HOLDEN
By Bob Thomas A
St. Martin's Press

Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (a
1950 film) opens with William
Holden's corpse explaining how it got

that way and unfolding a riveting tale _

of a gone-sour Hollywood dream. It
was an excellent portrayal and a
breakthrough movie for Holden, who
was accepted as an actor of conse-

I

' quence at last. The career had started

when he was 20, a contract split
between Columbia and Paramount

‘ and an ”unknown signed for leading

role" break in 1939's Golden Boy with
Barbara Stanwyck—who insisted
thatihe not be fired when his inexpe-
rience proved a drawback. The film

I , provided a. nickname for William

Holden and.now the title of his

1 biography.

Journalist Bob Thomas knew
Holden for 35 years and had inter-
viewed the actor a number of times.

’ THE FILM YEARBOOK 1983

Edited by Al Clark
Grove Press '

The Film Yearbook 1983 is a British
cinema reference text that first
appeared in late '82 Over There and
has just arrived Over Here. The Year-

"'“°PI°H weimm

book, edited by Al Clark, covers films .

released during most of 1981 and
early 1982, making it nostalgia as
soon as it hits the bookstore. Still, it's
a neat compilation and overview;
Clark has blended the work of 18
other contributors, Andrew Sarris,
Dave Marsh and Dilys Powell among

A them. Although the British film

industry‘ is markedly different from
the U.S.A.’s, they've enough in com-
mon to make Yearbook a pleasant
reminder.

Clark provides an introductory
alphabetical listing of films from the
1981-2 period with credits, cast and
succinct synopses. The rest of the
content ranges from the dryly hu-

-1 mourous dissections of the year's

turkeys.(for instance, Mommmie Dear-
est and Butterfly); to a blow—by-blow

diary of the Heaven's-‘Gate disaster—its-

story idea goes back as far as 1971; an

odd collection of quotes and an oblig- -

ing list of the world's cinematic
award-winners. Clark characterizes

 

TARIHD GOLD  

associates were interviewed during
the preparation of the book.

Although "untold" in the title sug—-

gests dangerous National Enquirer-type

’ hackwriting, the end result is (thank-

fully) a careful and concerned study,
unfortunate only in that it needed

' telling so soon.

Like Sunset Boulevard, the book opens
with William Holden's death at 63 in
November 1981. At home and in a
vodka-induced haze, he'd fallen,
gashing his head on a table end and
bleeding to death. Billy Wilder com-
mented, ”what a lousy fadeout." But
Holden considered the acting profes-
sion not' quite manly and learned as

early as Golden Boy that alcohol pro-.

vided a useful tension release, easing
his comfort in front of the camera.
He would jump onto the wagon many
times in later years without success.
Once Holden had been established
as a calculable actor‘ of skill and
charm, his career leapt ahead with
efficient speed—Stalag 17 (for which

' he won an Academy Award), Love is a

Many-Splendored Thing, Picnic, The Bridge
on the River Kwai.... By the 1960s, act-
ing was secondary—he made films
only to finance his "avocations." His
major interests were Africa and game
conservation. But still, he gave the
public The Wild Bunch, The Blue Knight,

. Fedora and ot.hers—69 movies over 43 '

years."

On film, Holden was solid, hand-
some, dependable, memorable. A
working actor. Off film, he was
private—amorous, reckless, a victim

of self-doubt and tremendous guilt..

He was a traveler, a ”citizen of the
world," constantly sparring with
fame. And he was an alcoholic. His
life fascinates; by rights, he should
have told of it himself. But Bob Tho-

mas’s extensive research insures at‘

least as thorough a composite of this

complex actor as his fans are likely to a

get. Golden Bay is a decent, respectful
tribute. And sad, so sad.

EDIE," AN AMERICAN BIO-
GRAPHY

By Jean Stein, Edited by George
Plimpton .

Dell

No doubt, you've heard just about ‘

all you want to know about this very
”in" chic—reeking expose about one of
America's most decadent, albeit pre-
viously unknown, media stars: Edie

Sedgewick, the woman—child with,

the impressive blue-bloodlines who
starred in some very bad Andy War-

hol movies and who wore black‘

- ,4

tights. Bob Dylan wrote songs about
her, Jim Morrison went out with her,
Vogue proclaimed her ”a star to watch

for," and everybody, but everybody’

was mad about her! Only problem is,
she died before she reached the age of
30, drugs and the high life cutting her
off from anything resembling a nor-
mal life.

One of the many reasons why this
book is so good—and, let's face it, a
book about some rich, spoiled brat

who spent approximately $80,000 a 4

week and could afford to buy the
kinds of drugs that eventually killed
her is exactly the kind of book that
could be violently hated—is that the
author, Jean Stein, looked to more
than just the obvious to explain Edie’s
rise and fall; most people would just
have pinpointed the druggie years as
a reason, but Stein's thorough inves-

tigation of Edie’s family history turns -

up other clues. The conclusion
reached puts the blame somewhere
between the pressures of stardom
and the substances Edie used to help

_ her cope with that arena, and the

intensely weird, upper-crust
Sedgewick clan who brought her up
and whose genes she unfortunately
inherited. ,

I/Vith Edie, An American Biography,
you can tilt your nose up in the air‘
just so and get into the snobbery act
for all its worth, but you'll still be
affected by this sad, haunting
account of an American daughter
gone awry.

JUNE ALLYSON

By June Allyson and Frances Spatz
Leighton

Berkeley

June Allyson was perhaps the most
unlikely star of 1940s movie musi-
cals. But with her deliciously husky
trademark ‘voice ("million dollar
laryngitis"), self-taught style of.danc-

ing," and soap—and-water prettiness,-3--

she was one of MGM galaxy’s bright—“
est and most ingratiating. She
teamed memorably with James Ste-
wart, Van Johnson and others;vand
she was perfect.

She's always seemed untroubled;
presumably, the same quality
extended into her private life also.
Which brings us to June Allyson, an
autobiography co-authored with
Frances Spatz Leighton. The big
”why?" question comes up, as with all
books of this sort. Qne expects no
satisfactory answers, either. The

early stuff is typical, about how‘
seventh-grader Ella Geisman _auditi- ‘

oned and won a place in a Broadway
chorus line and changed her name.
After some years in shows, she grad-

uated to feature roles and then Holly-5*

wood. Details about her films are

sketchy, but singing and dancing

-always made her uncomfortable: "I
would throw up," she writes. '
What gradually emerges is a pic-
ture of a naive girl, entirely under the
influence and dominance of her much
older mentor-husband (and'movie
star) Dick Powell. He’ referred to her
as his ”eldest child," managing her
earnings and her life like a stern and
distant father. His death from cancer
in 1963 left her quite alone in a posi-
tion she knew nothing about; she
withdrew into the bottle and married

June Allyson ,

again, badly, and again’—fo1_'tunately.

Secure for the present, at the last,
June Allyson is able to say ”today I am
a woman. I'm not the scared little girl
anymore." Examination of the book
reveals the standard star-bio ramifi-
cations,_but hers has been a fragile
life—if the telling of it has provided
her with any catharsis or peace, at
least her fans will agree that]une Ally-

. son is worthwhile.

JAMES DEAN: A PORTRAIT
By Roy Scatt
Delilah

Anyone who has cared enough to
find out what James Dean was "really
like" has discovered all they would
care to know about this man-child
turned legend, his impetuous, ego-

iqhoniacal nature and his desire for

premonition of death at an early age.
History doesn't need another book to
restore Dean's persona; if anything,
the legend shines brighter now than
ever. A

The best thing about Roy Schatt’s
James Dean: /1 Portrait is that it contains
only one “ brief ' chapter of such
recycled information. Schatt, a pro-
fessional photographer, knew Dean
as both a friend and pupil (Dean asked
 for photography lessons). This
book examines both a subject (Dean)

land a period‘ (mid-late '1950'.s)

through pictures, most taken by
Schatt, of Dean but some taken by
the actor as well. The book does not
attempt to draw any conclusions
other than to say that a lot has
changed in the 26 years since Dean's

._ death.

The very nature of the book allows

the reader to see, ignore or dismiss .

what they will. The pictures here
offer a built-in safety feature, an
indelible look at Dean that neither
time nor an author's interpretations
can alter. Pictures offer only the sur-
face of Dean, but as writers who have
attempted to dig further have disco-
vered, that is where Dean did most of
his living (albeit in an ever-changing

g"form).

Countless biographers and film-
makers alike have cashed in on
Dean's life and myth. Schatt’s unpre-
sumptuous, casual scrapbook on the
man comes as a pleasant and refresh-
ing surprise. The choice of picture
here isn't intended to be a golden
treasury of Dean poses. With the
exception of Schatt’s well-known
"Torn Sweater Series," which was

...shot for Life magazine but never ran,

" the pictures offer an'in'formal,'almost

calming look at Dean. But as Schatt
reminds us,’ James Dean rarely
"turned-off" the endless stream of
facades. '
D/ean, whether frozen in stills or
moving on the screen, dominates the
frame. If you care or think you might
know why then this book will exam-
ine the legend before it was chris-

Q tened, giving you a different angle

from which to approach the question
of why, after a short life and even

' shorter acting career, this man took

on immortality. Schatt only gives us
his evidence, leaving the reader to
-come up with their own explanations;

ROCK CI-IRONICLF

This book contains the information
you hear every day on radio stations
across the country about what hap-
pened today in rock history, brought
to you by The Source (apparently,
"The Force" of rock and roll, huh.7),
and narrated by Dan Formento, the
legendary disc jockey you can't
escape, even though you'd probably
like to. (But, hey, it's better, I sup-
pose, than having to listen to the
”Mindy of Video” —-her words, not

_ mine—Martha Quinn, recite rock
events of yesteryear on radio; just .

think, on the radio, you wouldn't
have Martha's disgustingly cute out-
fit and different-paired earrings to
distract you from her insipid ram-
blings and grin-a-minute muggings!)
So, basically, you've probably
already heard most of the facts that
are in this book, but for those of you
who are, say, big fans of MichaelJack-
son, and you want to plan a birthday
party in advance, then this book will
come in handy; you won't have to
wait until August 29‘to learn that his
birthday falls on that very day, thus
leaving you no time to order canapes
in advance from the caterer and stock
up the booze cabinet. Just thumb
through the pages of ROCK CHRON-
ICLE quickly and plan your party two
weeks ahead of time! ~
Interesting tidbits about what hap-
pened today (August 28) in rock his-
tory: Bob‘ Dylan was booed off the
stage in" Forest Hills, New York, for
playing the electric guitar instead of
his then-usual acoustic model; The
Beatles played Dodger Stadium in

REGGAE INTERNATIONAL
By Stephen Davis and Peter Simon
Knopf .

Reggae has become a word familiar
to just about everyone. Pittsburgh's
own reggae band, The Core, out-
performed The Clash last fall at
CMU. Recently the S.W.A.M.M.P
Band has drawn many curious Pitts-
burghers to local clubs for a chance to
experience reggae as it's heard. in
Jamaica. There's also 'YDD's 1260
Club, Peter Tosh's ”Johnny B.
Goode" video and Eddy Grant's
”Electric Avenue." Reggae has clearly
established itself on an international

' scale in spite of the fiercely competi-

tive environment iofthe music indus-
try. For those who desire an
awareness of reggae, its history, reli-
gious and political aspects, the asso-
ciated culture, and the many artist
who make it happen, Reggae Interna-
tional is an excellent, readable disser-
tation on the subject.

Reggae International is a collection of
essays and interviews encompassing
every notable performer or aspect of
the reggae culture. The book begins
with a short description of Jamaica,
from its discovery by Columbus to
how the British brought inzgslaves
from Africa and turned the island
into a "huge agricultural factory."
The’ illustrations are colorful and

plentiful, making every aspect of this

. tions

fine work very readable. Whether
you're interested in dub, dreadlocks,
ganja or Rastafarianism, there are
first-person interviews. explaining
individual involvement in the reggae
complex.

The text gives accurate accounts
on the history and progress of such
bands as Black Uhuru, Steel Pulse and
Third World, even of reggae off-
shoots like The Specials, English
Beat, Madness, and the Police. The
section describing the assassination
attempt on Bob Marley was chilling.

This book may be the most com-
plete, well-illustrated description on
reggae you willever read.

STREISAND: THE WOMAN AND
THE LEGEND

By James Spada

Pocket Books

People have always been fascinated
by paradoxes, and James Spada has
used this fascination as the major
theme in his biography of Barbra

V Streisand, a performer who certainly

generates vastly disparate reactions
among audiences and co-workers.
Spada has explored the contradic-
inherent in Streisand——her
homely beauty, her naive sophistica-

E tion and her klutzy elegance—and

come to the conclusion that her wide
appeal is rooted in her duality. How
many other performers’ albums
might have a place in the collections
of both children" and the
grandparents? '

The book is an easy read. Basically
chronological in organization, it
avoids becoming merely a dateline of
Streisand's career through the inclu-
sion of extensive quotations and a
generous selection of photographs
that bring the narrative to life. Every
piece of work Streisand has done is
discussed fully—from her early door-
step warblings in Brooklyn to the still
uncompleted Yentl. I-Ier musical
development is traced through her
eclectic, slightly obscure first albums
to her chart-making contemporary
efforts. All accounts are embellished
with pro and con remarks from those

' close to her, and reviews of all her

albums, films and stage performan-
ces are the by-product of the story.
These reviews are valuable because
they are collections of thoughts on
the material from those involved in
producing, choosing and performing
it rather than those of a critic who
was asked to review it.

This biography doesn't suffer
unforgivably from either common
ailment of star biographies—worship
or ‘./illificatio_r1 of their subjects. As
the author of another Streisand bio
and publisher of the Barbra Quarterly, a
newsletter devoted to Streisand,
Spada might be suspected of "wor-
ship." He does present Streisand in a
favorable light, but he doesn't
assume she can do no wrong. She is
not treated as a goddess but as a per-
son, albeit a special one. This book
can be enjoyed by someone who is not
a rabid Streisand fan.

Although it would be difficult to
guess from the covers and title, the

/book is not grossly ov.erwritten. The -

back cover, with phrases like "incred-
ibly gifted," "amazing talents" and
"fully revealed by friends, lovers,

family, fellow performers," encour-

 

\ .

ages expectations of a scandal-filled,

sensational expose. Between the cov- x

ers, «however, is a balanced, fairly
level-headed account of the_career of
a talented, versatile performer.

‘THE ILLUSTRATED BOOK OF
ROCK RECORDS, A BOOK‘ O
LISTS ' .
By Barry Lazell and Dafydd Rees
Delilah Books i

The title here is misleading; this
book is nothing more than a small-
sized paperback, under 200 pages,
with chintzy photo-copied pictures
and cheap construction (my copy fell
apart before I reached the end)-
hardly seems to warrant its mam-
moth title, does it? And things don't
improve once you start reading.

This book is composed entirely of
lists—lists which have something to
do, one supposes, with rock—n-roll
(although names like Bing Crosby,
Doris Day and Johnny Cash crop upa
lot). The problem is, the majority of
the listings aren't very interesting or
astounding; just factual stuff that
only the most ridiculous of rock his-
torians would care about. I mean,
who cares what the first 10 singles
released on the Philles label were? Or
what 10 records were produced by
someone named Joe Meek? .

Things only get interesting when
the authors divulge the names of ten

artists who died in plane crashes. ‘

(Buddy Holly, Patsy Cline and Otis
Redding, among others); rockers who
died while on tour (Eddie Cochran,
Duane Allman, Marc Bolan, etc.)'; and
songs which were banned by the

BBC: John Lennon's "Working Class /
Hero"—-politics; Sex Pistols’ "God"

Save the Queen”—disrespect of roy-
alty; and "99% Is Shit" by something
named the Cash Pussies—for
obvious reasons. But these kinds of
facts are really only for the morbid or
slightly deranged, and, even at that,
there aren't nearly enough of them to
satisfy me.

But if you're really interested inall

. this rock—n-roll trivia stuff, a far bet-

Marianne Faithfull

 Miller

ter investment would be The Book of
Rock Lists (1981) by Dave Marsh and
Kevin Stein. It's much more compre-

hensive than this book is, and besides, ‘

it's funny.

The Story of Sparks:

SHOWCASE, Orientation Issue, Sunday August 2.8, 1983

Script: Frank DiGiac_omo

There is nothing to get excited about
at a Howard Johnson's. Visiting one
may cause some sort of psychedelic
experience due to the management's
merciless overuse of the colors aqua
and orange, but it will never elicit any
sort of autonomic arousal-
whatsoever. '

Then why is that threesome in the
front booth by the PLEASE WAIT
TO BE SEATED sign‘ having such a
good time? Two guys and one wom-
an...hmm...good lord, call the vice
squad, Elvira, and have the guys in
the motor lodge check the register for
a room with three people in it. Well,
never mind, just ignore them , and
they'll go away. That one guy on the
edge; yeah, the one with the funny
moustache—bet he's with the Nazis.
They having a convention-in town?

No, no, no, those three aren't weir-
dos or commies or anything like
that—they're rock stars. The two
guys are brothers, Ron and Russell
Mael, and they call themselves
Sparks. The female is Jane Wiedlin
and she's from a band called the Go-
Go's or something like that. They
sure do look like they're having a

good time, too. Jane is all California

giggly and Ron and Russell look like

‘ they're planning high school senior

week. Don't be fooled though; with

V other people they're really shy and

quite wary of press people who ask
too many questions.’
Sparks is not. a new band—The

Brothers Mael have been releasing
albums since 1971. In fact, they've
released 12 albums in that time span.
Not bad for a band no one's heard of.
Ah, but Sparks is changing that.
Their single, "Cool Places," with Jane
Wiedlin, was all over the charts and
there's more to come. In addition, the
band, again with Ms. Wiedlin, has
been touring with Rick Springfield to

_ promote their present Sparks in Outer

Space album—that's why these three
are sitting in a Howard Johnson's in
Pittsburgh on this aqua and orange
July morning.

Inferring each of the Mael broth-
ers’ personalities solely on the basis
of their respective appearances is a
mistake. Onemight expect Ron, with
his Chaplinesque moustache, slicked
back hair, and white shirt buttoned at
the collar, to be as silent as the film
"star he resembles. On the other hand,
Russell, with boyish good looks and
chic oriental sailor sweat shirt, would
seem to be the likely candidate for the
group's mouthpiece—-after all, he is
the vocalist. Actually, the brothers’

'personas are quite the opposite.

Occasionally, she will sit down to

Ron begins by rehashing the ori-
gins of Sparks. He explains that the
concept started‘ in L.A., the Mael's
hometown, when the brothers got
together with an electronics wizard
named Earl and started making all

these demo tapes in his apartment.
Eventually, the band sent their tapes
to every record company and were

rejected by every one except Bears-

ville, where Todd Rundgren and
Albert Grossman liked what they
heard. The group did two albums
with the label, Halfnelson, which
yielded the single "Wonder Girl," and
Woofer in. Tweeter's Clothing. "Both
/albums, at the time, were really seen

 as being a little left field. So, after

they were released, we really had to
decide what to do because nobody in
the States wanted to know about
Sparks and what we were doing,"
explains Ron "So the two of us moved
to England at the end of '73. We went
with Island Records and put together

 

 

Both Ron and Russell place most of

    

another band, recorded, and the first
thing we released went to number
one there."

That first thing was Spark's Kimono
My House and it was the band's first
gold album. Theirisudden success in
Britain convinced the brothers to
stay there for three more years,

releasing Propaganda and Indiscreet. In.

1975, Melody Maker named Sparks as
"Brightest Hope—International Sec-
tion." ' _ ~
Still, that did little for the group's
fame back in the States (some people
thought the Stray Cats had it bad)

_and when the Maels returned to the

U.S. to release Big Beat they were once
again greeted with muffled response
from record—buyers and critics alike.

the blame on American radio; "The
radio stations are so conservative
here in the States,” says Russell,
arranging his eating utensils so that
they are equidistant from each other,
"It’s just awful—really putrid."
”One thing is that it's more impor-
tant there in England," elaborates
Ron, "It's in the newspapers every
single week and there's Top of The Pops
and everybody's really locked into the
music thing. But I*think that the atti-
tudes of the people here aren't any
different—it’s just what they're
exposed to over here. They're not
given a chance to listen to things that
aren't sort of the straight—and—

narrow."

I



The last phrase is a key one when it
comes to describing Sparks, but only
because the band is anything but
straight-and-narrow in style and
content. The Mael’s claim to have

never latched onto any of the numer-

ous trends that have presided during
their 12 year existence.’ Naturally,
they will now be pigeonholed into the
syntho-pop category because of their

synthesizer sound, but the truth is ’

that Sparks have been using synthes-
izers long before the British Electric

1 Foundation could ever conceive of

the Human League or Heaven’17. In
fact, it was Sparks’ eighth album, No.
1 in Heaven, an all—synthesizer collabo-
ration with Giorgio Moroder in 1979,
that has been quoted by bands such as

“the above as a great influence in

spawning the ultimate direction of
the British new wave. ,

Russell feels that No. I in Heaven
was one of the first attempts to put
synthesizers into a sort of rock
perspective—one that shows Sparks
as being clearl.y ‘ahead of their time.
However, Russell also acknowledges
that, at that time, no one else thought
so. ”It wasn't like the robot sort of
thing, such as Kraftwerk; it was a
rock band using synthesizers and we
were crucified because fans of Sparks

' said we'd sold_out and made a disco

album,” he explains as he piles his

38>’ Pants.

silverware one on top of the other.
”We never saw it as a disco album; we
‘saw it as an album using synthesizers
that had a beat that you could dance

to. Now, five years late, it's called-

’dance rock’ and it's the trendiest

.music you can be doing. A lot of Eng-

lish bands have told us that that one

1 album was really influential in their

careers...because it was different
from what ‘was going on back then.”

Of course, the Maels feel cheated
by the hand of success, but they seem
to comfort themselves with the feel-
ing that they will outlast the whole
syntho-pop movement and the bands
that live off of it. ”We’ll still be mak-
ing records after the syntho-pop bit’s
finished because, for most of those
bands, the sound’s the whole thing,"
says Russell eyeing his triangle sculp-
ture of Oneida ware, ”Whereas,
we've always based everything
around our songs first, and then wor-
ried about putting them into the con-
text of how we are going to record
them. All those bands that are solely
in the syntho-pop genre, they only
know how to make good sounding
records based on whatsynthesizers
can do ..there’s nothing wrong with
it, but it's also inhibiting in what you
can do. If you can't write a song that's
good in itself then, ultimately, you
can get by only as long as the trend

._.___%~\

lasts because so much depends on the
sound.” ~

One of the most essential ingre-
dientsof a Sparks song is its humor,
and Ron, being the chief songwriter,
finds that there's plenty to laugh
about here on earth. But he warns
that his brand of humor should not be
seen as satire. ”Satire, to me, is just
making fun of something and I don't
like doing that...A lot of times Ilike to
take a situation that you wouldn't
ordinarily sing about or turn a situa-
tion around,” he says, ”But just to
think of something and poke fun at it
isn't something~—-I mean that's really
easy to do.” His case in point is ”I
Wish I looked A little Better” from
the new album; a song sung by some-
one "who is comparable to the Ele-
phant Man in Armani clothes. ”So
many rock songs are sung from the
standpoint of somebody being real
groovy, and I thought it was neat to
have a song sung by somebody who's
not so groovy," he explains, ”Espe-
cially from a band that's got some sort
of image going for it occasionally—on
good days.” I .

Thatois a loaded answer, but Ron
won't pull the trigger—at least not
“yet. Instead, he calls Jane away from
the movie section of the paper and
asks. her to define Sparks’ image.

”Very Mael” is her snickering

 

- _  —  ’;P',cV1gc;3;l‘*_
response, ”An all-Mael «ba’ndi.”‘
(Maybe somebody should checkjthle.
register for a room with three in it.)

”Ask Cheap Trick, they'll tell you,” 

laughs Russell. He is no longer fijd-'
dling with the silverware andthere is
a sheepish grin on his face.

”I don’t know," says Ron, apparl 
ently dissatisfied with both answers, ;.
”One good-looking guy and one 

funny—looking guy.”

So much for a definiton-of their 
image. Actually, it's about as reveal.-V

ing as their definition of Sparks’
music: ’
”Lovely,” is Jane's word for it.
”Kinda lovely,” is Russell's answer.
”But not too lovely,” adds Ron.

PUNCH THE CLOCK
Elvis’ Costello and the
Attractions

Columbia

The ‘first evidence of some-
thing different about Elvis Cos-
tello is on the cover of the new
album—large wire—rimmed
glasses have replaced the trade-
mark black frames. It's not the
only innovation, though. Listen
to Punch the Clock.

The usual terrific work from
the Attractions is accompanied
on this outing by Afrodiziak, a
feminine duo providing soul-
tinged background vocals, and

‘the “TKO Horns, a four-man

organization whose tight charts
lend a structured big band jazz
feel to the material, and some
tasteful string arrangements.
Costello's last album, Imperial
Bedroom, tentatively dropped his
angry defensive a bit, offering
an honest glimpse of the inse-
cure fellow behind the facade.

1 ‘ Punch the Clock takes him several

steps further; besides accessible
pop music, the album features
some of his most optimistic
work yet.

Family and romantic relation-
ships in their various forms are
still the focus. But Punch the Clock
comes close to being a "concept"
album, with its title as the uni-
fying theme in two different
senses: the good and bad time-
clock-regularity and regimental
strictness of love, as well as the
"punch" inherent in actual

but they're really hard to hear

(they're probably synthesized)._
Supposedly the musicians have

been classically trained but it's
really hard to tell when all they
use is synthesizers. '
However, they do have two
things going‘ for them. One,
they aren't depressing: for once
they are no songs about nuclear

devastation, overbearing moth- .
' ers, or gruesome pet deaths.

Two, "Safety Dance" is a great
single and even better now that

; Backstreet wised up and put the

beefed’ up version on the album
(instead of the mediocre MTV
version).

Another thing too, is lead sin-
ger Ivan Doroschuk’s voice. He

fighting. It's evident in song

and in references throughout
the rest of the material as well.

gives all the bright, cheery
songs a sinister edge to them.
So, for those who can afford

THE LOST TROPICS
The Lost Tropics
MCA

There are eight notes in_ the
musical scale and only so much
that can be done with them.
New groups attempting to
break into the pop market are at
a decided disadvantage-
they've got to be different
enough to attract attention, but
not too different or they will be
ignored. The Lost Tropics are
trying to make the jump;
they've just released a self-
entitled debut album, and they
paid the admission price, too,

ing lyrics:"Punch the clock keep
boxing clever/you'll be young
enough forever."

The 13 cuts on the disc are
mostly prime Costello. He's in
good voice-and-guitar; Attrac-

having spent some years in
clubs polishing their craft.

The Lost Tropics are a New
York-based quintet consisting
of vocalist Monica Serra; bass-
and-guitarists Jerry James and
Terry Bacon; keyboardist Steve

J, Kaufman; and drummer M.E.

Miller. Ten of their own songs
comprise the LP, and it does
have quite-' a bit going for it.
Serra has a pretty and listenable
voice, the rest of the band are
competent musicians, and they
produce a nice instrumental
blend and balance.

So what's missing from The
Lost Tropics? The songs are
melodic and pleasant enough,
but unfortunately, not particu-
larly surprising or memorable-
most of this is strictly typical
pop music. The lyrics are OK,
dealing with romance and desire
in various forms.

"Tonite is Booked" and "Too
Much to Handle," though, are
good ones, and the best of the
lot is "Girls," anupbeat number
with good hooks and some
interesting musical effects. The
best cuts reveal promise, mak-
ing The Lost Tropics par but not a
must in terms of album debuts.

NEVER KICK A SLEEPING
DOG
Mitch Ryder
RivaIPolyGram

Say the name "Mitch Ryder"
and most of today's music lis-
teners will think of the medley
sung by Bruce "Don't Call Me
God" Springsteen on the No
Nukes album (it was the only sav-
ing grace of that otherwise lim-
ppid release). Few remember that

tions drummer Pete Thomas
and bassist Bruce Thomas build
solid frameworks, and Steve
Nieve's instinctive keyboard
work is impressive, particularly
during the excellent "The Invis-
ible Man"——-"lt's a wonderful

world between these cinema
walls," he says. "But if stars are

only painted on the ceiling
above/then who can you turn to
and who do you love?"—and
there's good horn work,too.

One of the current singles is
"Pills and Soap," a somber and
hypnotic poke at Margaret
Thatcher's England. But the
other one is "Everyday I Write
the Book," a joyous warning to a
new flame: "I'm giving you a
longing look." Costello's lyrical
prowess is evident in his subtle
turn of phrase and analogy. The
neat, expert rocker "Let Them
All Talk" says "Oh yeah, we're
killing time...our day will come
when you have squandered all
your youth." Family reunions
are roasted in "The World and
His ‘Wife," and Costello is still
the master of the rhymed coup-
let: "The little girl you dangled
on your knee without mishap-
/stirs something in your memo-
ry/and something in your lap."

Punch the Cloclc's intricately
blended wordplay and melody
make it another worthwhile and
thoroughly rewarding calling
card from Elvis Costello and the
Attractions.

RICHARD SATER

Ryder, along with his legendary
band, was the greatest thing to
come out of Detroit back in the
60s besides Motown. I Not
that Ryder had retired from
rock-n-roll; he's been active,-
touring and releasing records,
especially in Europe—but the
hits just haven't come his way in
years. .

So what's the verdict on this
John Cougar-produced "come-
back"? It's...alright. Not horri-
ble, not fantastic, but okay. I
suppose it's unrealistic to‘ wish
for another "Devil With The
Blue Dress," but it's hard to con-
trol your dreams. There are .a
few good songs, especially

'"When You Were Mine", a

Prince remake that rocks
enough to make it a conceivable
hit, and "A Thrill Is A Thrill,"
the much talked-about Mari-
anne Faithfull duet. But, aside
from these few songs, the
whole album suffers from
"ordinariness"; the entire
second side slides right by with-
out any one song standing out.
Ryder can certainly kick out a
tune with as much raw power as
anybody in rock-n—roll-—that's
not the problem. The problem is
that the material isn't good
enough for him; in fact, most of
it sounds like John Cougar
stuff.

Never Kick A Sleeping Dog comes
off sounding like "the new John
Cougar album as sung by Mitch
Ryder" instead of a new Mitch
Ryder album. It seems an
injustice——like if Keith Richards
decided to teach Chuck Berry a
few new guitar chords. Know
what I mean? '

LAWYERS IN LOVE
Jackson Browne
Elektra/Asylum

"Buses, car horns, ghetto blasters
The shouts and screams of the human
disaster
I cast my hopes on the human tide
Place my bet, and let it ride
Darkness falls on the vast machine
Where the future stalks the American
dream"

"Downtown," Jackson Browne

Jackson Browne, the pedron
of what remains of the L.A.
music mafia, continues to claw
away at profundity on his new
album. What results are these
surface sweeps at pop—sociology
and street-grown sensibility.
Lawyers in Love, Browne's first
album release in nearly three
years, moves in much the same
direction as Hold Out (1980), the
lyrical digression reaching the
point (no lyric sheet included) of
dispensability. After all, the
words say so little anymore.

"Downtown" is indicative of
much of the album; lacking any
lasting preceptions, the song
exhibits all the symptoms of an
old man hitting from the same
cigar for too long, ultimately
coming to a coughing and
wheezing end. Whereas
Browne once offered a simple,
yet effective mix of insight and
commentary, Lawyers In Love set-
tles instead for a few moments
of mood which the lyrics at best
only accent.

Browne continues to strive
towards a hybrid Hollywood
rock sound here, but only occa-
sionally does he deliver (e.g. the
straight—up "For A Rocker")
with the kind of force that saved
the last record. Rosemary
Butler and her soaring vocals
allowed us to ignore such lyrical
sap as "Boulevard" but she has
passed up Lawyers in Love to work
on her upcoming solo album.
Gone also are David Lindley and
his one-of-a‘-kind lap guitar, and
Bill Payne, ex-Little Feat and
longtime L.A. session keyboard-

ist. The title track here screams V
V (literally) for Butler's assis-
I tance, and a great premise dwin-

dles when she doesn't arrive.
Only "On The Day” stands
out from the rest, its taut open-

; ing chords and "yeah...yeah....

yeah" backing chorus balancing
nicely with the song's swaying
harmonies.

Music's modern-day ex-

Malcolm McLaren, has finally
gone and done the unimagina-
ble: he's released his own album.
That's right, kids, his own—not

something by one of his ex- A

charges like Adam, Johnny or

even a Burmese refugee. But, _

keeping in line with McLaren’s
signature policy of not actually
doing the work himself, Duck
Rock is really a collaborative
effort, acted out figuratively by
various groups of musicians and
directed by McLaren.

It is also McLaren’s policy to
exaggerate the truth in order to
make everybody play his game_
(and thus, since he's the only
one who knows all the rules, he
usually wins by outscoring eve-
ryone else in hype points), and
so, he's been media-mouthing

HEXBREAKER
Fleshtones
I.R.S.

Okay, stick your fingers in a

_ live light socket until your hair

singes and your skin starts to

bubble. That's good enough. I

Did you scream? Did you shake
all over and flail your arms like
some sort of obsene stuffed
doll? Good, ’cause you know
just what the Fleshtones can do
for you.

Their new one is entitled Hex-
breaker and it beats the hell out of
Roman Gods ten times over. Peter
Zaremba and his mates have
captured that James Br-own
magic and mainlined it with the
garage band raunchiness that
these boys have always known
how to deliver.

Hexbreaker brings the sixties
back to the eighties with a
sound that'll send you smashing
windows and kicking in doors.

It's brain fever on vinyl; it's, it's——

...good Lord....There's harmoni-
cas, sleazy saxophones, tijuana

, horns, Peter Gunn riffs, cheesy

organ runs, and oh, that raw,
strep-throated singing of
Zaremba that would make Joe
Cocker’s skin crawl with envy.
God, he even sounds angry.
That's nothing even mediocre
on this album. It's just one con-
tinuous contortion party com-
plete with howling, yelps, and
yahoos. There's even "New
Scene," a "My Generation" for
the eighties that has Zaremba

that this record contains music
from all over the world—the ads
scream things like "Take a trip
around the world with Malcolm
McLaren!" But the facts are that
four songs were recorded in
Africa, one in Tennessee, and
the remaining six in New York.
One continent, one state and
one city hardly constitutes a trip
around the world.

Perhaps the ads should say
something more like "Urban
culture meets rural culture,”
because that's what this record
really represents, from its cover
art of Bronx ghetto blaster cool
meets native jungleland to the

T ..T1

 

screaming "Reject your false
values!"—what a line.

Strummer, you're a wimp;
Lydon, don't even bother-
Zaremba and the Fleshtones are
back in town and they're got the
Hexbreaker.

FASCINATION
The Human League
A 8: M

The Human League appar-
ently has stalled. It's been two
years since their breakthrough
album, Dare, was released, a pas-
sable effort enlivened by a good
single. The new offering is Fasci-
nation!, a six-track disc which
features only two new songs
along with some leftovers.

The six Humans in the
League seem to know what
they're doing, though. _Ian
Burden, Jo Callis, and Philips
Wright and Oakey provide the
music, entirely synthesized,
bloodless but lively pop music-
but that's what the fans are
after. Side 1 opens with "(Keep
Feeling) Fascination," the new
hit and a worthy successor to
"Don't You Want Me," featur-
ing a sideshow fanfare intro, a
dance beat, words that seem to
make sense, strong and clinging
hooks, and a tantalizing "hey
hey,hey hey" counter—theme.

"Mirror Man" was a hit in the
U.K. last year; it's still good.
"You know I'll change] if change
is what you require..." with a
lead vocal from Oakey and ooh-
oohing from Joanne Catherall
and Susanne Sulley. "I Love You
Too Much," the other new tune,

is more of the same, and "You"

Remind Me of Gold" '5, givea-
way title tells all. A mundane
and monotonous exercise called
"Hard Times" (those two words
comprise the entire lyric) from
1981 fills out the album.

So what about Fascination/.7 It
tastes good going down; it is
eminently danceable, and the
slick, cascading computeriza-
tion and effective vocals are
easy to swallow. The whole pro-
duction is shimmery and clean.
Success factors were pro-
grammed into the album along
with the bass and drum tracks;
enough of it works to make the
calculations justifiable.

RICHARD SATER

VE BEAT

synthesized Zulu beat inside.
McLaren has taken the ethnic-
ity of two seemingly opposite
cultures and meshed it into a
single style.

In literal terms, McLaren
recorded the music of one of the
mentioned regions, dubbed syn-
thesizers and, on occasion, even
a string section, over it, added
his own lyrics and then had two
New York D.J.'s (The world
famous Supreme Team, acting
like narrators) do their thing
between numbers. The result is
an abrasively fresh, yet accessi-
ble kind of dance music that is
impossible to describe on paper.

Duck Rock is ironic in a way,
because while McLaren is still
an exploiter in every sense of
the word, he's proven that
exploitation doesn't necessarily
just mean "rip-off"; here,
exploitation could mean pro-
voking a music revolution.

Sparks Interview (Continued)

we first started off, it was a totally
democratic band, and I'd really rather
work this way, where it's more
authoritiarian, because you can just
move fast and you don't have to keep
arguing over small points,”he says. ”I
like doing that, I don't like to labor
over decisions that are just made
arbitrarily any way. When we go into
the studio we work really fast and it's
just a lot easier that way.”

The most current result of the
Mael’s studio work is Sparks In Outer
Space. In addition to the facts that this
album has sold more and received the
most U.S. airplay of any Sparks
release, the brothers feel this record
is special because it is the first one
that they produced themselves. "It
really is the album that is most the
way we wanted it to be because we
produced it,” Ron says. "So, I think
that that general direction is going to
be the way we'll continue for a while.
It's always hard to know, because
we've said this for the last 10 years,
but I think in this case, it's really the
way we want things to go. It's not
like, at a certain point, you ever con-
tinue to progress or anything, you

just come up with songs that you’

think are good and you record them
in a certain kind of way—you just
have to keep challenging yourself as
far as songs go.”

Another reason why this album is
special to the Maels is the guest
appearance by Ms. Wiedlin. Fortu-
nately, Jane sits still long enough to
retell, for the umpteenth time, how
this association came about. She
explains that her best friend from
high school now runs the Go-Go's

  

SHOWCASE, Orientation Issue, Sunday August 28, 1983

fan club and that, as part of her job,
she joins other bands’ fan clubs to see
what their packages are like. Conse-
quently, when she wrote to Sparks’
fan club she mentioned that Jane was
a big fan of the Maels. "Russell got
the letter form his fan club people and
he wrote back saying, 'Well, do you
want to sing a song?’ and that was
that," she says, "It was that simple
and it happened so fast, too.”

The end result was two duets with
Russell, ”Lucky Me, Lucky You" and
the single ’’Cool Places,” which has
given the band much needed expo-
sure to a newer and larger audience.
But that's not all. The trio has already
recorded a demo that may surface on
the upcoming Go-Go's album, and
the Maels have dibs on producing
]ane’s solo album—if and when the
situation arises.

Surprisingly, the Maels readily
admit that recording a single with
one of the Go-Go's had it advantages.
"It’s an angle...radio people would
obviously be more curious to hear a
song that's got a Go-Go and Sparks
rather than Sparks and Sparks," says
Russell who is now staring at his tea.

"Beyond that, I don't think people
are going to buy it just because of
that," interjects Jane. "They have to
like the song, too."

"Cool Places" is the first Sparks
single in a long time to reach a high
position on the U.S. charts and that
has the Maels quite happy. However,
it has taken this type of success a long
time to catch up with Sparks and
there is, of course, no guarantee that
they will continue to ride this crest.
Still, Ron is not worried because

Page 35

according to him, Sparks has always
been popular somewhere. ”We’ve
been lucky because when sales
haven't been happening in one
place—we had a song in France that
was never even released in America
called ”When I'm With You," and it
was gigantic over there. It came at a
time when nothing was really going
on in the States," he says. "It always
seems to work that way for us. We're
really happy, though, that it's going
well in the U.S. because it's much
more of a challenge here than any-
where else."

Though Sparks’ success overseas
has kept them afloat for 12 years, it
still has not netted them the big bucks
that a major hit in the U.S. market
would bring. Ron would like some of
the security that a smash single or
album in the states would bring
them—both with their finances and
with their record company. Sparks
has been dropped by five labels and,
although they believe that Atlantic
(their current label) is the first com-
pany really committed to selling the
band, they are aware that that omi-
nous number could be upped to six.

”It would be nice to have the secur-
ity of knowing that you can keep

going on doing for a while," Ron says,

"But it always seems like we're on the
edge of disaster. I think, though, that
we've bought ourselves some time
with the new record, and that's all I
really care about.”

"That’s kind of the nature of the
business," comforts Jane. "It’s like
each record buys you some time. I
don’t_ feel any more secure having
made two hit records. It's just kinda

like, ‘Oh God, it's okay till the next

one.’ ”

Russell, however, has a much more
positive outlook on the situation.
While he feels that breaking it big
would be an added bonus, he believes
that Sparks has been able to maintain
itself without giving in to trends or
compromising its integrity. "I don't
think there is any other band in the
same position as Sparks. We've been
allowed to make 12 albums—I can't
think of anyone else who has released
12 albums and is known, but is not_ a
huge commercial seller,” he says.
”Somehow what we're doing _is good
enough that it keeps sustaining itself
despite not being huge com-
mercially.”

Russell is right—most bands would
call it quits after the third record
company dropped them or after the
fifth record didn't make it in the
States, but Sparks has somehow
stuck it out through. Whether it's
because of their intense love of their
work or just through sheer stubborn-
ness, Sparks refuses to die.

It is Russell's final statement that
sums up the past, the present, and the
future of Sparks. Oddly enough, he is
not looking at silverware or teacups,
but is instead staring straight ahead
when he utters his closing words: ”It
seems when Sparks tries to make any
concessions it turns out tolbe a disas-
ter. We can’t be just a regular run-of-
the-mill band. There isn't a
commercial answer to what Sparks is
doing—it just takes the right song at
the right time—all that sort of thing.”

Shifting sands

  . Winds Of Trench Warfare May Befall

By'MARK A. SINDLER

EDINBORO, Pa—Don’t look for
it to happen overnight, but it’s possi-
ble that the Pitt football defensive
tradition will resurrect itself now
that the passing of the Dan Marino
years is completed.

Head coach Foge Fazio, a sole
believer in defensive football even
before becoming head coach last
year, enters a new campaign with the
hope of making it six years in a row
that Pitt has been tops’ in rushing
defense and-total defense. For the
past five, NCAA Division I statistics
have not been lying.

Also enter the fact that Fazio
brings in hand-picked assistant
coaches Bob Junko (defensive coor-

,/

dinator, linebackers) and Gerry Sol- A

oman (defensive ends), among three
other rookie assistants.

His exclusive choices coincide

with the. vast inexperien_ce_ just as_ _

vastly apparent at the quarterback
spot that made Marino the Pitt
legend he is. How much‘ can it be
emphasized? Between John Cum-
mings and Chris Jelic, there is only
one pass completion. Jelic’s next

attempt will be annointed as his first. ’

Ever.
Seems short and sweet, huh? It
shouldn’t, because this creeping shift

in priorities from offensive ram-

pages to defensive standoffs goes
just a’ little deeper andperhaps has
begun already. With seven starters
on last year’s unit now gone, the 1982
offense looked just plain stale. The

Facing

Time Around

By MARK A. SINDLER

EDINBORO, Pa.—Time was
when Pitt defensive secondary coach
Dino F olino had his job made infin-
itely easier by some gifted talent. So
much so that the last two years have
been considered vintage years for
Folino. ’ .

After crossing state lines from
Cincinnati, where he was an assis-
tant for five years, Folino was dealt
several backfield cards, minus the
suits of two former anchors, Lynn
Thomas and Carlton Williamson.

Folino thus walked through the
doorway marked 1981 with nothing
but rebuilding on his mind. The phil-
osophical partly-full (or -empty)
glass of water came into focus.
Either half the backﬁeld needed
shoring up, or starters Timmy Lewis
and Peep.Short were returning.

Regardless of how this unsettling
predicament’ seemed then, boththe

new starters and the rookie assistant
ultimately strayed far from solvency
as Pitt registered its third consecu-
tive 11-1 excavation by developing
roadways out of its opponents.

That success story and the fact
that Folino contributed to the
Panthers’ gaining more yards in
total offense than their opponents
during 10 games last year have
brought instant credit to Folino, 34,
for molding solid defenders.

Lewis, with Green Bay,_ is now the
highest paid rookie safety, and
Short was a New York Giants walk-
on free agent. ‘ .

Rebuilding, though, hardly does

justice to Folino’s in-coming third ‘

season, what with the Lewis and
Short years now memories. Night-
mares withstanding, he is almost
beginning from square one.

Undoubtedly, all this talk ‘about

he is not a field general so easily

Belowich’s Goal:

How Central Is The Question?

3; scon DELLETT

The time for backtracking has
ended. While the 1982-83 season was
a year of adjusting to play in the Big
East for the Panther basketball
team, this season will tell if Pitt-a
team that made waves by upsetting
Georgetown, St. John's and
Syracuse—can compete in one of
the top basketball conferences.

Last season was typical with one
exception—the Panthers peaked too
early. Like the two previous seasons,
head coach Roy Chipman had a
team which started off very slow,
losing both games at the Amana-
Hawkeye Classic along with blow-
outs by Villanova and Syracuse and
a close loss at home to Connecticut.
Doubts were running rapid. The
Panthers were intimidated by the
competition. This was the big time.
Apparently, Pitt wasn't ready.

So it seemed. But a tactic move by
West Virginia coach Gale Catlett
may have sparked the Panthers
through the second third of the sea-
son, Catlett delayed the game,
demanding to see the game contract
in order to determine the use of the
45-second clock.

The result was a 81-67 rout of the
best team in the Atlantic 10. It also
gave an enormous amount of confi-

dence to Pitt.

Sure, Clyde Vaughan had no
problems adjusting to the league, as
he led the Big East in scoring. But
one man doesn't make a team, espe-
cially in the Big East. The key was
point guard Billy Culbertson.

Culbertson emerged during the
Mountaineer game, scoring 14

points, while dishing off seven’

assists and making five steals. His
play enabled Chipman to move
George Allen to second guard, a
spot to which he was more
accustomed. ‘ ,

The move gave the Panthers the
momentum to pull off a string of six
wins in eight games. Despite a disap-
pointing loss to Notre Dame in a
slowdown at the Civic Arena, Pitt
came back to defeat Georgetown in
a nationally televised game at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

A post-season bid was within
grasp. Especially with Providence
and Seton Hall in the last four
games. Yet, the Panthers went into a
five-game skid, including a loss to
St. John's in thefirst round of the
Big East. .

The guard play deteriorated dur-
ing this time, and the load again was
put on Vaughan. Without any inside
play of which to speak, the Panther
season ended on a miserable note, as
Pitt ﬁnished 12-l5, Chipman‘s first
losing season.

This prompted Chipman to go
after guard Curtis Aiken. Aiken, a
5-1 1 guard from Buffalo, N.Y., aver-
aged 36.5 points per game for Ben-
nett High School, which won the
New York Public High School
Championship. Aiken is expected to
give stability to the "guard spot.

However, Pitt didn’t improve on
one area, one which needed work——
the center position. Andre Williams
was often intimidated in the middle,
and Keith Armstrong was not ready
offensively to compete.

The position is still in question, as
Pitt failed in its attempt to recuit
6-ll Rob Cornegy and 6-9 John
Culbertson. Although the Panthers
won the Marlon Ferguson sweep-
stakes, the injuries were deep.

Assistant coach Seth Greenberg I

was forced to resign after a recuiting
"violation with Ferguson and a possi-
ble one involving former ‘Panther
center Paul Brozovich, now at
Nevada-Las Vegas.
season activities have tarnished Pitt.
A possible solution to the center
problem is 6-10 Jeff Robinson. A
natural forward, Robinson may be
forced to play center. Darryl Shep-
herd, a 6-4 swingman, could challege
for a guard spot.

.There are still ‘questions about

how successful the Panthers can be
in the Big East, however, they
should be answered this season.

honors as a swimmer at Penn
State, where she surely became
acquainted with the Lady Panth-
ers’ rich aquatic traditions.

But acquisitions often accom-
pany losses in collegiate athlet-
ics, and Pitt is no exception.
Estelle Grant and Jan Ujevich,
last season’s co-captains, have
completed their tasks at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

Grant, a four-year letter
winner, leaves behind a gaping
hole in the breaststroke event.
Ujevich leaves the Lady Panthers
looking like Swiss cheese.

" Ujevich’s hallmark was versa-
tility. The four year All-America
claimed first place medal in four
individual events and two relays

. in last year’s Big East champion-

ships, where she was named out-
standing women’s swimmer.
“Jan’s versatility will be very

-hard to replace,” Belowich said.

“She was amazing. I could throw
her in any event and she would
do the job.”

But the reigning queen of
Trees Pool returns.

Sue Heon has donejust about
everything but walk _on water in
her three years at Pitt. She has
been named All-America every
winter since herjunior season in
high school. Even though she is a
shoo-in to win such accolades
again as a senior, Heon con-
tinues to work hard.

“Sue has a burning desire to
excel,” Belowich said. “She has
the dedication to be great, but
she is never satisfied."

“She's not satisfied with just
being ranked —— she wants to be
the best.”

Incredible goals for an incredi-
ble swimmer. Heon, last season’s
MVP, is rewriting the Lady
Panther record books at a fever-
ish pace, as five more school
records were added to her collec-
tion in 1982-83. Her perfor-
mance at the NCAA champion-
ships was the reason ‘behind

' Pitt’s ranking of seventeenth

nationally a year ago. -

A key "member of the United
States national team, Heon is
being touted as an Olympic
hopeful for 1984.

Another All-America, Diana
Firth, returns to work her mari-
time magic in the breaststroke,
individual medley and freestyle
events. The Montreal native will
be counted on to provide valua-
ble leadership, as will fellow
seniors Margie Curry (freestyle),
Heon (freestyle, individual med-
ley and backstroke) and Denise
Sedlacek (freestyle).

Belowich contracted the servi-
ces of five swimmers and a diver
in his off-season shopping spree.
The most valuable prize of the
recruiting season was Susan
Hickman of Orlando, Fla.

“She is one of the fastest sprint
freestylers to come out of high

school this year,” Belowich said. _

“She’s definitely at the top of our
recruiting class.”

At senior nationals, Hickman
turned in a ninth-place finish in
the 50-yard freestyle with a 23.2
clocking.. The team record of
23.55 seconds, set by former
national champion Kathy Stetler
in 1979, is unquestionably in
danger.

By CHARLIE O‘HARA

, Before 1982, if someone had pre-
dicted that a Panther athletic team
would finish with ﬁve All-Americas
and a national champion, which
team would have come to mind?

Most likely the football team, but
that was not the case.

It was the Panther track team.

A team that made its mark in the

east — placing second at two of the
more prestigious winter team com-
petitions, the Big East champion-
ships, and the Virginia Military
Institute Winter Relays.
, On the individual basis, in addi-
tion to the All-America 3200-
(4x800) meter relay team of Bill
Moorhead, Garland Brown, Terry
Gallagher and Darren Geary and
110 meter high hurdle national
champion Roger Kingdom, the
Panthers accumulated 23 school
records —— the most by any Panther
team in history.

With all that was accomplished
during the 1983 campaign, what
does the 1984 season hold? Can the
Panthers improve after losing
Geary, Gallagher, Rick Asberry and
Mario Joyner?

By all indications, there are quite
a few reasons why the Panthers
should be capable of picking up
where they left off in 1983.

Returning for the Panthers are
Kingdom, who competed in the Pan
Am Games earlier this month,
Moorhead and Brown, both
members of All America team, Todd
Colas, 1000-meter conference
champ and llth-ranked in the
world, Brian Pollock, the confer-
ence 300-meter champ, Bob Bucz-
kowski, the conference shot put
champ, Rich Baderinwa, school
300-meter dash record holder,
Ralph Mitton, the team’s triple
jumping specialist, and basketball
players Bryan Mitchell and Darryl
Shepherd, one ofa select few to have
defeated Kingdom in the high
hurdles.

Other returnees expected to con-
tribute are Rodney Chobany,
Mickey Rihtarchik, Pat Moran and
Tom Bailey.

As for the recruits, the list is long
and the accomplishments are

impressive.

Alan Laws, who attended West
Philadelphia High, was the Out-
standing High School Track Per-
former at the Penn Relay, for his

anchor leg of the (4x400) meter
relay. Laws was clocked at 45.5. In
addition he was sixth in the country
in the 600-yard run with his time of
1:1 1.8, and he has run the 800-meter
distance in 1251.2. '

Shane Saunders, a graduate of
Uniondale High in Long Island,
New York, can help Kingdom in the
hurdle events. At the 1 10-meter high
distance, he has been clocked at
13.9, while in the 400-meter inter-
mediate hurdles his personal best is
52.5.

Greenville, Pa., native Tim Manes
is the two-time Pennsylvania AA
800-meter run champion. His 1:52.2
is the state record. He has also been
clocked in the 400-meter dash at 48.1

Gerard Battle, from Simon Gratz
High in Philadelphia, should help in
the sprint events. At the 100-meter
distance, his best time was 10.5. He
has also been clocked at 21.3 at the
200-meter dash and 48.3 for 400-
meters.

Jason Harris, from Clifford Scott
High in East Orange, New Jersey,
was the state's AA champion in the
400-meter intermediate hurdles.
He’s also competed in the 110-meter
high hurdles.

Jeff Longbottom, from Oakton
High in Alexandria, Va., has run the
400 intermediates in 54.0, the 110-
meter high hurdles in 14.3, the 400-
meter dash in 48.5 and the 500-meter
dash in 65.9. .

Owego, N.Y., native Jesse Mikell,
is yet another capable sprinter. In
the 100-meter dash, his time 10.5, in
the 200-meter dash, 21.5, in the 400-
meter dash, 48.6, and indoors, he
ran the 55-meter dash in 6.3.

Bill Lantz, who hails from
Menchvill High —— Panther asst.
coach Steve Lewis was formerly a
coach there — in Newport News,
Va., was one of the state's top pole
vaulters. His personal best is 140".
In addition, -he runs the 110 high
hurdles in 14.6 and has been mea-
sured in the long jump at 22’6”.

Jim Johnson, from Bayshore
High in Long Island, N.Y., is
another pole vaulter. His best vault
was measured at l4’3”.

Melvin Brown, from Eleanor
Roosevelt High in Bowie, Md., has
run the 800-meter distance in l:54.8
and the 400-meter in 49.1. 7

Chris Williams, from Overbrook
High in Philadelphia, also a 400-

and 800-meter man, has been
clocked at 47.00 and l:5l.0,
respectively.

Brashear High’s David White has
run the 800-meters in 1254.0. John
Thomas of Gateway has run the
3200-meter run in 9:23. More impor-
tantly, he was the No. 1 man on the
Gateway AAA state champion cross
country team.

Probably the most heralded of the
Panther recruits is Rodney Giles,
from Northern High in Northern,

Allng the Pltt track team In competing with the big boys of

the B19 East is Brian Pollack, the eonterence’s 300-meter

champ.

Md. Giles is ranked No. 10 all time
in the 800-meter run for schoolboys,
and his time of 1:48.61 ranked him
second on the USA TODAY pole.
He won the 800-meter run in the
Junior Nationals this summer. In
addition to his specialty, the 800,
Giles has run the 1500 in 3:51 and the
400-meter dash in 47.7. .

In reference to his recruits, Vas-
vary said, “There's no doubt that we
took a step in the right direction. We
were aided greatly by the kids who
ran so well last year. They gave us an
excellent starting block from which
we could attract kids. Once we got
them to come to Pitt and meet the
people in the program, the place sold
itself.

“Another important factor in our
success was the commitment from
the university. They have proven
that they are willing to send us to any
meet to the country. Basically, it
could be said any runner who would
compete at Pitt would have the
opportunity to face the toughest
competition available.”

Vasvary ‘said about the season
beginning in December, “We will be
very solid from the 1500-meter run

The Panther schedule —— though

Ohio State Invitational, the Big East

door season finds the Panthers com-
peting in the Dogwood Relays. the
Penn Relays, the Colonial Relays,
the Big East championships, the
ICAA championships and the
NCAA championships.

It will be interesting to find out

to contend for one ofthe top spots in
the Big East conference.

GVERNMENT

 

Almost
Starting

From
Scratch

By CHARLIE O‘HARA

When a team places eighth in a
nineteam conference, the ensuing
season's forecast can be only one of
two possibilities: improvement or
disaster. Panther cross country
coach John Vasvary believes it will
be the former.

“There is no doubt in my mind
that we will improve on last season's
efforts," he said. “To think that we
will be challenging for a conference
title would be almost out of the
question.

“Providence returns several
members from its powerhouse team
of ’82. In addition, Villanova and
Boston College made very successful
overseas recruiting trips to South
Africa, Northern Ireland and
Ireland.”

The Panthers didn't resort to such
recruiting measures but were still
able to come away from the 1982-83
recruiting wars with some hope for
the future.

Among the youngsters who will 

be entering the running program,
four will be competing as members
of the cross country team.

Despite the fact that he must sit
out the balance of the 1983 season
due to NCAA rules, sophomore
Tom Tobin, the former PIAA (Pa.)
cross country state champion, pro-
vides the program with optimism for
the future. Tobin, who spent his
freshman year at North Carolina
State, attended North Hills High
School

Of those recruits to bring immed-
iate aid to the cause will be John
Thomas, of Gateway High School in
Pittsburgh, Alan Laws of West Phi-
ladelphia High and Chris Williams
of Overbrook High.

Thomas, as a senior at Gateway,
was the No.1 man on the Gators
AAA state champion cross country
team. Thomas may also prove valu-
able when track season rolls around.
He should provide some support in
the 5000-meter and 10000-meter
runs.

 Defenders
Will Spikers’ Roster Point 0 Another Championship?

2!

By MARK A. SINDLER

It’s almost the story of his life:
Come time for recruiting talent-rich
players, women’s volleyball coach
Shelton Collier always ends up on
the wrong side of the net during the
regular season. Or so he says.

The reason is obvious. Anemic
scholarship funding annually plays
the role of ‘Scrooge.’ Theatrics
aside, it is this issue that can be
flogged only so many times, to no
avail.

So as Collier embarks on a new

schedule beginning Thursday’

against Navy, he begins a plotted
stampede towards the Top 20.

Without an accordingly strong
roster, he says.

Through the course of this five-
tournament-inclusive schedule, Col-
lier believes his squad will look
beyond the Big East championships
in late November to the NCAA post-
season tournament in December.

Without an accordingly strong
roster, he says. .

x In sketching the 1983 opposition,
Collier purposely sought national
powers in the likes of Nebraska,
Florida State, Purdue and Tennes-
see.

Without an accordingly strong
roster, he says. .

And this could well be the season,
Collier says, when intra-conference
opponents continuously look over

their shoulders at Pitt and not vice

versa. ,
Without an accordingly strong
roster, he says.
Collier also said, “During the reg-

ular season, our goal is to establish

ourselves as a Top 20 team, and in
order to do that we're going to have
to win every time we take the ﬂoor.
We’re going to have to win all our
matches with no slip-ups.”

Sounds like Ponce de Leon’s
quest, for the fountain of youth.
Maybe it should—not a single senior

 

 

 

remains among Collier’s 10 troops,
four of which are juniors.

In figuring out how Collier will
play mastermind with a “not real
strong roster,” consider his picking
up two scholastic championship
team players and a redshirted “star”;
consider his scrapping a traditional
5-] offense in favor of the chic 6-2;
and consider, most importantly,
that six highly-seasoned upperclass-
men return from a year fraught with
injuries.

During the offseason Collier
nabbed Kris Wexell and Sue Hoover
as his big recruits. The former is
coming off of Norwin’s eighth con-
secutive state AAA championship
team and the latter played on the
state AA championship team,
Richland.

The rest is merely the stuff of for-
malities.

“Kris is probably one of the best
people at serve reception of anybody
that I've ever seen,” Collier said.
“We already have some alignments
that will utilize her passing-serve
abilities. We’ll look to her as we used
Sally [Gillespie, sophomore from
Norwin] last year in the backcourt.”

When the Lady Panthers are not
on the defensive, a large degree of
offensive success will be determined
by Cathy Rupp, a redshirted junior
transfer from Ohio U. and one who
Collier said “easily learned the sys-
tem last year and will step into a
starting role.” Rupp is entering
graduated A Julie Gaul’s vacated
space at setter.

Not" only must Rupp prove that

Gaul’s presence won’t be missed, but
she must also integrate Collier’s new
mappings with junior Judy Young in
keeping Pitt’s inner workings ﬁnely
tuned.
“Our setting position will be our
primary concern as soon as we get
back,” Collier said in anticipation of
last Thursday’s first day of camp.

“I have a lot of work to do with
them in getting [Rupp and Young]
acclimated and teaching them the
offense. It’s going to take us a while
to get it developed to the point I
want it developed.”

But why tinker with the formula
that brought last year’s Big East
championship squad and a 42-7
record?

Because, Collier said, “Both
Cathyland Judy are very good spik-
ers. Our team needs some offensive
firepower. In the past, we’ve always
had a couple real good spikers and
this upcoming year we need to utilize
their spiking.

“If we used a 5-1, that would take
[Rupp and Young] out of the offense
as far as hitting.”

In Collier’s new 6-2, where two
setters are equally employed as hit-
ters, the other four positioning spots
are more than adquately accounted
for. Carmen Tapia, at a towering
5-11, and junior Ulana Kohutiak -
two indispensable middle hitters —
return to assured starts at the inside
where Collier will look to keep team
defense sufficiently bolstered.

Competition will be much fiercer
at the outside, with no fewer than
five players vying for two slots. The
Norwin duo, Gillespie and Wexell,
are the strong favorites. Junior Pat
Belcher would get as strong a nod
were it not for knee surgery per-
formed after last season. Her rehab
is said to be complete, but nagging
questions still remain.

Regina Reyes returns from
summer competition in Puerto Rico
where she played in the Superior
League, composed of junior
national stars. But since she proba-
bly received more playing time there
than during her freshman year last
fall, questions are again in order.

Another strong candidate is
Hoover, whose college stamina has
yet to be tested. Despite the pre-

7

 

 

  

season predictions, though, Collier
will give all five equal chances dur-
ing this, the first week back.

“[Sally] will be right in there with
the five,” Collier said, “but it’s hard
to say who will take charge. All of
them have the necessary attributes:
Sally is a great defensive player, Pat
is probably our most powerful [out-
side] hitter and Sue Hoover and Kris
Wexell are both excellent incoming
freshmen.”

As the Lady Panthers set their
sights on another NCAA.tourna-
ment appearance, they’ll be doing so
without the figurehead leadership
abilities that prevailed in years past;
years that saw _Paula Olsens, Linda
Stadlers and Julie Gauls keeping
tight-knit formations. .

_ Although Collier concedes that
these stigmas evolve naturally, he is
out to stop another type of evolve-
ment: Erosive habits and tendencies.

“We’re going to have to attend to
the little things — the little things
that in the past maybe we let slide a
little bit here and there because we
were a pretty good team," Collier
said.

“In a way we can compensate for
some of those little mistakes we
made, but this year’s team is going to
attend to the.little positioning mis-

Page 41

takes we’ve made in the past. We’re
going to be more demanding on"
exact and precise ballhandling skills
and we’re going to shootfor even
more intensity and concentration.”

By doing so, Collier predicts that
the team he starts with will definitely
be different by season's end. It’s not
a matter of changing faces or posi-
tioning players as if they were living
in a revolving door.

Instead, it all gets back to the
fourth-year coach's ability to refine
raw materials. .

Collier calls it a challenge.

“At the beginning of the season,
this team is not going to be anywhere
near as good as last year’s team,” he
said. “But by the end of this season,
I'm real confident that this is going
to be a better team.

“We’re going to work harder than
any team I‘ve had in the past has
worked and just work hard at doing
what’s necessary to be a Top 20
team. “Maintaining that Top 20
ranking is what we're going after
regardless of the circumstances that
we have to work with or against or
whatever.”

To be accomplished, he says,"

without an accordingly strong
roster.

for were running without direction
and that the man he was protecting,
Marino, “threw the ball 60 yards

said. “We were too predictable the

“The major places you can make
an impact is on the line play,” he
said. “On our line play, I think that
most people that you play put a big
emphasis on X’s and O’s. As a result,
I think fundamentals can win foot-

the entire squad seems plugged in to

offensive scoring is dominant over
defensive stalkings, just as Fazio
considers Jelic l-A to Cummings’l

Saurer’s Rise Atop Big East May Wait I Year

By MARK A. SINDLER

Looking at the picture from a cou-
ple of different angles, it appears
that the women’s basketball team
just couldn’t cut it last year. Of
course, its entrance as an infant into
the Big East conglomerate was a def-
inite factor.

And true, Pitt finished the year
tied for second place with Provi-
dence behind St. John’s.

But this is not a conference com-
prising patsies. The Lady Panthers’
5-4 mark in intra-league competi-
tion not only revealed thatbut also
told coach Judy Saurer that .500
play is hardly adequate.

All too soon, the Lady Panthers
found out. The squad dropped a 61-

60 heartbreaker in the playoffs to a '

rival that finished lower in the
standings—Georgetown. And with
that, the postseason tightrope on

"—-__~_\__. _ ._ -‘Z,’ .2

   

\-.-.’2*g./

which the cagers were balancing
themselves snapped.

They had to content themselves
with a 17-ll seasonal showing in a
year during which forward Jennifer
Bruce accrued three Big East Player
of the Week accolades.

Ah, but that is what’s so nice,

about history - you can pick and
choose from it what you want. The
rest is, well, just for the books.
What Saurer learned from her
first year in conference play will be
made evident as she progresses
through a new and demanding 1983-
84 slate. Saurer may have to wait yet
another year to pull Pitt to the top of
the Big East scorecard. ' '

Seniors will not be part of the
Saurer story this season. It is
because of this missing experience
that she may have to once again set-
tle for second or third place.

‘_— ‘, T ‘_. , _"~—f/A— A " — ‘L 7‘

Though both were key performers
last year, graduated Pam Miklase-
vich and Lynn Love may both be
missed early on but should be easily
replaced by a recently harvested
crop of six recruits. Miklasevich and
Love were right behind Bruce in
overall scoring last season with 476
and 148 points, respectively.

Tops on Saurer’s list is UConn
transfer Lisa Fubio. With three
years eligibility remaining, the jun-
ior sat out a redshirt year last season
after averaging 9.4 points a game as
a guard for the Lady Huskies.
Fubio, also while in her freshman
year, led UConn. in steals and was
second to one in assists.

“Lisa was really one of the most
exceptional high school players in
the state,” Saurer said. “(Though) I
think she’ll be a major contributor
for the team, she needs to shoot
more instead of giving up the ball.”

E N

Another transfer, Jenny Tyner,
joins Saurer’s roster, but she will not
be eligible until-"January. The 6-5
sophomore hails from Northeast, a
small school in Louisiana, and will
likely do time as a forward.

The top replacement candidate at
Miklasevich’s spot is Lombard, Ill.,
native Julie Callan. A former 6-1 for-
ward at Willowbrook High School,
Callan scored 1365 points during her
scholastic stretch. Under coach
Lloyd Scholl, Callan mustered 21
points a game while shooting 49 per-
cent and 51 percent from the field
and line, respectively.

USA Today’s honorable mention
All-America also contributed eight

assists per game; and, noted assist- .

ant coach Carol Dugan, Callan is
adept at playing well with either her
face or back to the basket.
Similarly aggressive is 6-2 for-
ward Pam Novosel, who excelled in

“Living Off Campus”
By Nancy Popkin

,I was walking down Forbes
Avenue, or was it Fifth, the
month of my first semester at
Pitt with a second-year student.
“I’ve been looking for the sign

 for a year,” she said to me. “And,

\

.\\'

I still haven’t been able to find
_it.” ~.
 “What sign are you talking
about?” I asked her.

“The huge sign that says, ‘Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’ next to an

ivy’-covered stone wall with acres A

of green grass behind it. That is a
university.” '

No one can deny that Pitt
lacks rolling lawns and wrought

Q’ iron fences, but, its setting does

have nonaesthetic positive char-
acteristics. Unless your stomach
can survive on nine months of
cafeteria food, and your social
life on hall parties and movies at

David Lawrencce Auditorium”

you will want to get to know
Oakland because you are one of
us, a commuter.

Oakland ‘is probably best
known to students for its array
of restaurants and bars. You will
especially feel right at home if
you have an affinity for pizza
and fast food.

If it’s not consumption of food
or beverage that draws you to
Oakland, the local museums,
theaters and ﬂower conservatory
offers lots of culture. ‘

But, for many students Oak-

, land is simply a place to live

when the dorms or commuting
from home becomes impractical
or inhibiting. Rental units. make
up 52.8 percent of occupied
housing in South Oakland and
76.8 percent in North Oakland.
Living in an apartment can be
economical and an experience in
independence. In the first
months of living in an apartment
with two business majors I spent
hours trying to figure out the
utility bills. Fortunately, I
learned quickly, as it was a job
that I assumed by default.
And, remember all of those

winters‘ that you whined at your

father for turning down the ther-
mostat to save money? Well,
there is no doubt that you will
have a roommate that is equally
concerned about the “conserva-
tion of natural resources”.

Of course, there are always the

arguments over which is really
better, Miracle Whip or real
mayonaise. Or, as my neighbor
would frequently complain, who
drank the last of the hot
chocolate.‘ '
2 But, if the complaints about
who heard who doing what
through their bedroom wall at
three a.m. canbe kept at a min-
imum, living in an apartment
can be more fun that work.

For instance, our apartment
has become a place of collec-
tions. We have a collection of
empty spaghetti sauce jars. We
also have at least 15 ashtrays and
50 semi-used packs of matches.‘
We have nine different varieties
of shampoo in “our bathroom
and a hefty stack of magazines.
We sometimes‘ acquire garbage
that has failed to make its way to

the dumpster behind our build-'
‘ing.‘And, if you are reallv bad ‘

about cleaning, you could also
have a healthy collection of
roaches. (When they’re in your
apartment you call them water
bugs.) '

No matter who you live with,
or what their livestyle is, in Oak-
land you will never be in poor
company because most of your
neighbors will probably-be stu-
dents, too.

(Living in an apartment in
Oakland, does anything but iso-
late you from students and
friends. Especially, if the guys
upstairs have cable television.
But, trading the use of a vacuum
cleaner for some salad oil isn’t
the only way fellow students can
be depended upon.

I will never forget the night

I that my roommate’s exboyfriend

climbed through our_ first-ﬂoor
apartment window with bars on
it. The students living across the
street saw him and called the
police, and the girls across the
hall were in the foyer of the
building to greet them. The girls
upstairs called my roommated to
tell her what was going on. She
walked into the living room and
found 10 Pittsburgh policemen
standing over a guy sleeping on
our -couch. I was able to sleep
through the whole thing.

I, of course, can only speak
from experience. But, if you
were to ask any Pitt student liv-
ing in an off-campus rental, you
would probably hear some good
antecdotes and maybe even
some good advice.

PPC DOES IT
ALL FOR

YOU

From all of tls at the Pitt‘

Program Council (PPC)—
Welcome to Pitt! The PPC is
the major all-campus student
programming organization.
Though our membrship is
open to all students, most of
our members are commuter
students. As a student organi-

zation, we plan entertainment .
‘ programs, as well as, provide

opportunities for leadership
and personal growth.

To kick-off the new term,
the PPC will conclude the day
long Activities Fair (Monday,
August 29) with a concert by
the Iron City Houserockers at
Forbes Quad. Also, we have
planned several afternoon
concerts for _ the fall term
including a T.G.I.F. extrava-
ganza featuring Boystown.
Check our fall calender for
further information.

Several other daytime
activities have been intention-
ally planned to meet the spe-
cial needs and interests of the
commuting. student. ‘These
include a billiard trickshot
program with world cham-
pion Paul Geini (Sept. l3), a
professional ping-pong exhi-
bition (October 12) weekly
movies and music tapes in the

~TV lounge, a roving mime
(Sept. 22),and a variety of art

exhibits in the William Pitt

Union’s new Art Gallery.

» In addition, the PPC has
formed two new committees
to further meet the leisure
needs of commuting students.’
The Coffeehouse Committee
will be sponsoring several
local and national artists
throughout the term with per-
formances at noon and 8 p.m.
Also, the Leisure Learning
Committee will offer a variety
of non-credit courses for a
minimal fee.

The programs offered by
the Pitt, Program Council will
help make your time on cam-

.pus more enjoyable. We

invite you I to attend our
events and to join a commit-
tee of your interest. For I
further information about the
PPC and it’s programs, check
out our fall calendar. There’s
something in it for you.

 

 

:“IT’S ALL GREEK TO ME’’

By now you have probably
received a stack of literature a
foot high and are more confused
than ever. There’s one thing,
however,- you should dig out of
the heap, the information
regarding‘ rush ofr fraternities
and sororities.

Commuting can be a lonely
business and can rob you of a lot

. of colleges most memorable

experiences.

V When you graduate from Pitt,
you should have more than a
degree, you should have col-
lected many a cherished memory
and developed lasting friend-
ships along the way.‘

Fraternities and sororities are
vehicles that have enriched the
lives of many college students.
We urge you to explore the
meaning of being “Greek”.

Fraternity rush begins August
28 and ends,September 20, 1983.
To particiapte in fraternity rush,
you must register and obtain a
rush card for $5.00 which entitles
you to attend any of the func-
tions sponsored by the 21 frater-
nities during the, open rush
period which ends September 8.
During closed rush, attendance
at parties is by invitation only so
we urge you to visit all of the
fraternities during open rush.
Schedules and events will be

publicized in The Pitt News.
If a fraternity is interested in

' having you as a brother, they will

Sponsorship With Ser-

vz'ce....

Adidas has been selected offi-
cial sponsor of the 1983 Big East
men’s and women’s tennis cham-
pionships, conference commis-
sioner Dave Gavitt has
announced.

“I am very pleased with Adi-
das’ commitment to sponsor the
Big.East conference tennis cham-
pionships,” Gavitt added. “Adi-
das has been a major supporter
of collegiate tennisand will cer-
tainly enhance the quality of our
conference championships.”

The athletic apparel manufac-
turer will provide awards to all
members of the winning teams.
Also, all competitors will receive
a gift courtesy of Adidas.

Said J. Wayne Richmond,
Adidas national tennis director,
“Adidas has long been a suppor-
ter of intercollegiate tennis, and
we are very pleased to include the
Big East tennis championships in
our program.”

Adidas is the official shoe and
clothing of the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association
[ITCA] and a charter sponsor of
the ITCA Collegiate Tennis Hall
of Fame. Adidas is also the offi-
cial sponsor of the Adi-
das/MGM Grand-Reno Tennis
Classic, a leading indoor colle-
giate event.

The I983 Big East tennis cham-
pionships will be held at the Con-
cord Resort Hotel in Lake
Kiamesha, N.Y. The men will
compete September 23-25, and
the women will compete October
21-23. ‘

Masochism Or Martyr-
dom?. . . ..

Coming off. the worst sea-
sonal record in the National
Hockey League last season, the
Penguins still have their heads
above ice as they open yet
another campaign on October 4
in St. Louis. The Pens,compete
in the suicidal Patrick Division

with friendly neighbors includ- _ -

ing the New York duo, Rangers
and ‘Islanders, Philadelphia,
Washington and New Jersey.
Under first-year coach Lou
Angotti,
each of these opponents seven
times during the 1983-84 season.
The Islanders, Flyers and Capi-
tals will all come to the Renais-
sance II city four times, while the

Pens will swing four trips to face .

the Rangers and Devils.

All other teams in the NHL
will face the Penguins three
times. Boston, Buffalo, "Hart-
ford, Los Angeles, Minnesota,
Toronto and_ Winnipeg will play
the extra game in Pittsburgh,
while the Pens will make two
trips each to Calgary, Chicago,
Detroit, Edmonton, .Quebec,
Montreal, St. Louis and
Vancouver.

Slicing up the schedule even
more reveals the Penguins at
home for 13 Saturday dates, five
Sundays and ll Wednesdays. The
Civic Arena will also be host to
six Tuesday night contests, two
on Monday and Thursday and a
single Friday evening game.

The Penguins will embark on
reforming last year's ills when the
they begin training camp on Sep-
tember ll at the Cambria County
War Memorial Arena in Johns-
town.

Irony notwithstanding, it is
appropriate. The Pens will be in
for many a battle once fall’s cool
temperatures start defoliating
the trees.

Game 2: Temple. No problem,
Wayne Hardin is gone, so is his
magic.

Game 3: Time to go back on the
road — fire the travel agent. Mary-
land awaits the Panthers. In 1980,
the Terrapins were soup, but this
year the turtles will be snapping.

Bobby Ross has rebuilt the once-
dominant team in the Atlantic Coast
Conference with the help of left-
hand quarterback Boomer Esiason
and running back Willie Joyner.
Another tough game for a inexpe-
rienced squad.

ia. They may not this time. The

winning under fo.urth—year coach
Don Nehlen that they have not had
since 1975 — the year West Virginia
beat Pitt. Jeff Hostetler has made
the most of his second chance at
Morgantown. Having experienced
receivers such as Rich Hollins and
Willie Drewey to whom to throw
doesn’t hurt either. Paul Woodside
may be the difference this year, like
he almost was in 1982. Haunting
memories of Bill McKenzie at old
Mountaineer Field.

Game 5: Bobby Bowden is one of
the five best head coaches in college
football. The Seminoles could have
ended Pitt’s national championship
hopes much earlier. His strategy
shocked the Panthers and perhaps
— perhaps — the downpour saved
Pitt.

Tailback Greg Allen returns,
along with 15 starters from last year.
Bowden will have a gift-wrapped
surprise again. And he also
remembers.

Games 6, 7 and 8: The soft spot of
Pitt’s schedule, yet two of the three

' games are on the road. Louisville

and Syracuse should present no
problem, but Navy has a tendency to
give the Panthers fits. Maybe that’s
why Pitt hasn’t played the Midship-
men since 1979.

Game 9: Notre Dame. The first
visit to South Bend. For once,
revenge is on Pitt’s side. But the
Fighting Irish have quarterback
Blair Kiel, wide receiver Joe How-
ard and the typical outstanding
recruiting class. Notre Dame also
has the tradition. Only a running
back named Dorsett could over-
come that.

Game 10: Army will be the easiest
game in 1983. Enough said.

Game 11: Penn State has regained
the edge Pitt had in the late 1970s,
and now the Nittany Lions have a
national championship with which
to aid recruiting efforts. Despite los-
ing all but nine starters, Penn State
has six players who are being touted

as All-Americas. And Joe Paterno '

will have Penn State ready by then.
One advantage for Pitt -- Paterno
doesn't have the extra week to pre-
pare for Pitt this year, as Penn State
plays Notre Dame the week before.

The success of past years can
haunt Pitt in 1983, as revenge-ﬁlled
team are sharpening their fangs,
ready to avenge previous beatings.

However, this team isn't going to
lie down and roll over like an aging
dog in the sweltering summerheat.
Pitt will fight to maintain its elite
status.

Head coach Foge Fazio has his
team now. And he’s not fooling
around. Ask Ray Weatherspoon
and Chris Dolernan, who have been

demoted during training camp due
to various team violations.

This is not a team without talent.
Bill Fralic, Tom Flynn, Bill Maas
and Dwight Collins --4 though a little
in the rough — arejust waiting to be
polished.

Players like Caesar Aldisert, Troy
Benson, Matt Stennett, Bob
Schilken and Bill Callahan, ones
who had glowing high school
careers, now have the chance to

show they can shine as well at the
collegiate level.

Still, the main problem is quarter-
back. Sins of past years relived.
John Cummings brims with conﬁ-
dence, yet he has only thrown two

passes in two years, which is not of _

what quarterback candidates are
made. Remember, Cummings
couldn’t beat Dan Daniels for two
years. Also,'the l-A quarterback,
ChI‘lS Jelic, was recruited for his

Yet, Fazio will come up with
answers. He better, or the outhouse
awaits.

- Don't reserve tickets to Miami,
Dallas, New Orleans or even Tampa
for Jan. 1. But the Panthers won’t
spend the holidays in Pittsburgh.
The tradition will continue, how-
ever, not like the past. That would be
expecting too much.‘

Folino To Face
Transition 2nd Time

continued from page thirty-seven

Almost, because three-year letter-
men Troy Hill and Tommy Flynn,
an All-America candidate, return to
inflict terror upon enemy split ends
and ﬂankers and any other ballcarri-
ers who delight in scraping their eye-
brows against green surfaces.

“We’re very young and inexpe-
rienced at two positions,” Folino
said of strong safety and the right
corner. “Ray Weatherspoon does
have some experience, but he hasn’t
played over an entire season.

“That’s one of our concerns: How
healthy he’ll be through the season.
He’s had a history of some minor
injuries, and if he can stay healthy,
we think he can be pretty strong
there.”

A trace of skepticism appears.
Regarded , by many as Short’s
replacement, Weatherspoon’s status
is cloudy at best. He only saw action
in six games last year, mostly on
special teams — courtesy of those
nagging injuries — and was recently
demoted to third team by Coach
Foge Fazio for disciplinary reasons.

The Clairton senior now has to
work his way back to a spot of which
he wasn’t even guaranteed, from
there. A

That ought to fatten sophomore
Bill Callahan’s fortunes in challen-
ging Weatherspoon at starter. Ob-
scurity again reigns supreme,

however, since Callahan was taken
out of a sardine-packed offensive
backfield and switched to strong
safety. Revelation: No experience
there yet.

“The thing is,” Folino said, “Cal-
lahan is sucha fine athlete, he has to
be on the field. We can’t have a
player like that sitting on the bench.
I’m not saying he has to be a starter,
but we've got get football out of him.
We have to use his talents.”

’Tis easy to see why. Callahan
rushed for’ over 1,600 yards and 19
TDs as a senior at New Kensington’s
Valley High School.

Rampant inexperience at strong
safety only adds to Folino’s vacancy
dilemmas at right cornerback. Fil-
ling three-year starter Lewis’ shoes
will either be a J.C. transfer or a
player now recovered from short-
sighted playbook reading.

Sounds like choosing between a
cinder block and a watermelon while
slowly drowning.

“Melvin Dean-is slated as a starter
at right cornerback,” Folino said.
“After a great spring, he improved
his playing consistency. His problem
in the past had been he’d make a
mental error on occasion. When
you’re prone to mistakes, then
sooner or later, you’re going to make
one at a critical time.”

Folino is quick to admit that
Dean's mental mistakes surfaced as

result of lacking conﬁdence.
Unless Dean, a junior who backed

' up Hill last year, fails to live up to his

spring drill consistency, Chris Mer-
chant may be Folino’s buoy. The
Middletown, Ohio, native recently
transferred from California’s Han-
cock J .C.

Dean, just as Weatherspoon, saw
a lot of special teams play last season
and is not readily considered a shoo-
in

“You don't like a player to earn a
position by default," said Folino.

“The more players you have, the
more competition that you have, the
better off it is.”

Fazio, in agreement with Folino,
concedes there is no replacement for
experience. He yearns for two quick
transitions with the other two main-
stays, Flynn and Hill.

“We have some talent there,
they're aggressive, have a lot of
speed; however, we’re going to need
work,” Fazio said. “We’re going to
have young people battling for the
backup positions and anytime you

have that, young people tend to V

make mistakes.

“They just can’t make mistakes
and give up the big run, the big
pass.”

If there’s anyone aptly titled most
capable of cementing a solid secon-

‘ dary unit, it’s Flynn. The tri-captain,

once a quarterback candidate, spent
most of spring practice adding guid-
ance points when deemed appropri-
ate.

Flynn has since returned to his
familiar, rambling territory.

“I think we’re in transition,” he
said. “We’re not rebuilding because
we have Troy and myself back. But
we’re in transition because we have
two new guys that have to be molded
into the way Troy and I play.

“We have to get them accustomed
to the way we’ve been playing the
last couple of years: Get them out of
some bad habits, get them talking
and used to playing with us.” _

To do so, while attempting to drift
away from the Lewis and Short stig-*7
mas, Folino believes it not expedient
to forge Weatherspoon or a Dean
into the mold of the two former Pitt
greats. .

“A free safety is going to look at
Tommy Flynn and want to play like
Tommy Flynn is playing,” he said.

“Or he’ll play behind Timmy Lewis I

and‘ say, ‘This is good for me ’
Coaches got to teach them their
assignments, and they pick up good
habits from those playing ahead of
them.” 5

Flynn concurs.

“It’s the same thing when Timmy
and Peep came in,” he said. “There
was Carlton Williamson [49ers’ ’8l
third round pick] and Lynn Thomas
[49ers’ free agent] who are in the
pros. [Peep and Tim] came along,
and they both went into the pros
themselves. So you can never tell
exactly what’s going to happen when
two young guys are coming in.

“We’re all basically [of] the same
personality. We’re not going to put
anyone in that’s too far out of line.
We’ve got to think together and
therefore play together. Sometimes
they’re going to make mistakes that
new people make, so we’re going to
have to remember that mistakes can
be made.”

— Come Saturday evening, Tennes-
see will not let Flynn and the remain-
ing secondary corps to forget too
readily. The Vols’ first-year offen-
sive coordinator Walt Harris comes
off a three-year stint with Illinois
where he tutored NCAA record
smashers Dave Wilson and Tony
Eason. .

Both earned ‘straight A's as the
former threw for over 3,000 yards in
1980, and the latter connected for
over 300 yards per game during the
last two seasons.

Dino Folino now stands facing a
locked doorway, one that will open
to his third season with Pitt. But the
welcome mat will present him with
many doubts.

No sooner will the Tennessee bat-
tlelines he survived than he must
deal with Maryland’s Boomer Esia-
son and West Virginia’s dynamite
igniter, Jeff Hostetler.

And all in the margins of one
month.

Beyond that, Folino will realize
whether 1981 is carbon-copied ‘or

wish he had Timmy Lewis and Peep _

Short back for just one more year.

The one remaining frosh forced
Saurer to import her first recruit
ever. Pat Paul, a 6-2 forward from
West Hill, Ontario, averaged 28
points and 25 rebounds - eye-
opener numbers -- at Sir Oliver Mt.
Collegiate Institute.

Despite Saurer’s wanting her to
“improve on her outside shot," Paul
did impress others enough to earn
three-time MVP honors at Sir
Oliver. The Central East Regional
team star was also a two-time Metro
Toronto all-star competitor.

So the big question looming on
the horizon remains Saurer’s ability
to weave together six players with
current members while simultane-
ously making fourfreshmen’s transi-
tion to the college game as
unnerving as possible.

The Pitt News, Orientation Issue, Sunday August 28, I983

Soccer-Bred Bemis
Closing Out Tenure

Is there still any getting away from
the lack of seniors? Yes, said Dugan,
one of Saurer‘s two assistants.

“There’s no significance in having
no seniors. We don’t have the senior
out there, but we have the expe-
rience in Jennifer Bruce, Becky
Maziarz, Stephanie Collins. Plus the
leadership, I think, comes from
playing together.

“More than having a senior out

there,” Dugan added, “the way in

which they are going to be able to
communicate and, play together as a
team is going to be the signiﬁcance
of the season. In looking at bringing
in recruits, it was important that the
people we bring in will be able to
fuse together with the people here.

“The people we brought in
are...team—oriented. And that comes
from the beginning of our expe-
rience' which is in Jennifer (Bruce).
She's probably one of the most

unselﬁsh players if y‘b3.ﬂ'e going to
compare talent [because] she could
be very selfish.”

An invaluable point. Talented
players _of the Bruce variety can’t
collect player-of-the-week awards
with her consistency this year and
last and still have no regard for four
other teammates out there on the
hardwoods.

Moreover, the Lady Panthers
can’t expect to improve on their ’82
marks by solely relying on Bruce.
Undoubtedly she will be a signifi-
cant component.

But for Saurer to find a team-
oriented squad right now with the
immediate addition of five players
and one in January may be asking
too much. Selfishness is not the
issue. Five similarly-thinking play-

ers hitting the boards or cornering
an opposing dribbler on the court at
any one time is. ‘

the opposition, as an example.

After the initial road trip, the
team will play Indiana and then
travelto Villanova for the first time.

Bemis will retire after-30 years of
servicing the Panther soccer team.
Bemis’ career witnessed the team’s
installation in I953 and three
decades of ups and downs — of
course, the growing compeititveness
of the sport itself.

When Bemis — then a recently-
graduated student from the physical
education program —— started an
intramaral program with a few
enthusiastic scholars and 150-160 lb.
football players, he had no idea the

tions at Pitt. During the l950’s he
coached some fairly successful
teams that competed with soccer-
skill schools in areas such as Phila-
delphia, St. Louis, and New York
City where the surrounding high
schools sport strong programs that
feed players to the universities. Pitts-
burgh has never had such a draw

svstem, thus it’s been Bemis’ iob to

entice players from the Maryland/
Washington, D.C., area and the
eastern part of the state.

The l960’s saw a trermendous
increase in the popularity of soccer,
and Pitt spawned two NCAA
playoff teams in 1962 and 1965.
However, at that time, the university
itself was supporting academia far
more heavily than athletics which
drained many would-be soccer stars
of time and energy. Finally, in the
late ‘60’s, collegiate scholarships for

standards relaxed somewhat ano

Pitt played catch up with the other

big league schools in the 705.
Professional soccer teams became

a reality in the USA in 1970-1971. _

Pitt launched pro careers for several
players like Frank O‘Hara, one time
captain of the Pittsburgh Spirit, and
Joe Luybacker of the Philadelphia
Atoms, who will assist Bemis with
coaching duties this year.

Oddly,
always been in good standing, the
booters have never had a place to
call their home. Some seasons they’d
get to play their games at Pitt Sta-
dium but they’d only get to practice
there a few times. Other years, they
were banished to a thin strip of field
at the Ellis School in Shadyside. One
year, they didn’t have a field at all
and played at Oakmont andlocal
high schools. Schenley Park sufficed

Panthers inherited Forbes Field .for.~j

a time.

But despite these woes, Bemis has
always insisted his team play a
strongly competitive schedule. .

“I believe you should always play
the best —- if you lose, you lose to the

' best, but if you win, then you’ve beat

the best,” Bemis’ strategy is doubly
advantageous because the National
Coaches Convention which is the
instrumental unit in selecting the
National Champions uses difficulty
of schedule with win/lose recore as
its top criterion.
signed his team to play the National
Champions from the previous
season.

Bemis is also responsible for start-
ing the Western Penn Soccer Con-
ference in 1970 which includes
Gannon, Alliance, Slippery Rock,
Grove City, IUP, Sheeling, Young-
stown, Geneva, and St. Vincent’s.
He expects the Panther team to be a
formidable force in the league and
the quality of the program to keep
imroving.
