Elections Nearing

Political Parties Move Rapidly -

By Ed Bachman
Two political events occurred
during the past week, both of
which may have deﬁnite bearing
on the Mar. 30 school elections.
With women ﬁnally getting ap-
proval to enter political parties,
and with two of the three parties
collaborating on ~
the same slate,
all indications
point to the
most dramatic
political cam-
paign in Pitt’s
history.
In an. all-
night slate
meeting last .
Thursday at the 
Delta Sigma Phi
house, execu-
tive committees’ of the Veteran-
Independent Party and the Pitt
Party agreed to support the same

    

Ed Bachman

candidates in the coming elections’

for SC, MC and class presidents.

Road Cleared

By a vote of the Student Elec-
tions Committee last Friday the
road was ﬁnally cleared for
women to enter political parties
as well as enter’ their own slates.

Thursday’s move by the Pitt
Party and the V.I.P. to support
the same slate was a step which
demanded complete cooperation
by all concerned. Although the
move was just in rumor stage
for the past two weeks the ac-
tion came out in the open when
the executive committees met in
the “harmonized" slate meet-
mg.

Working until 3 a.m. Friday
morning the combined parties
ﬁnally came up with the list of
men who will be supported by the
Pitt Party ‘and the V.I.P. The
committees are’ checking on eli-
gibility of each man nominated and

A
W

the ﬁnal slate will be released
Friday.
Student Government

Bob Dickinson, chairman of the
Pitt Party, listed as the reason for
two-party co-operation that “the
two parties feel the important
thing is to place the best men in
student government.”

While the Pitt Party is primarily
made up of ten fraternities and
the V.I.P. is composed of veterans
and non—fraternity students, both
groups realize that there are good
men from both groups and it is
“in the best interest of the Univer-
sity to support the top candidates
of each party,” he continued.

Dave Guyol, Chairman of the
V.I.P., feels that, since the slate
will represent all groups on the
campus, it will bring to the fore
all possible segments of student
opinion.

Guyol points to the platforms of
the two‘ parties in explaining the
joint co-operation of the two
groups. Both platforms stress that
fraternities and independents are
deserving of representation ‘of stu-
dent government. I ’

Debate Ends

The Student Elections Commit-
tee approval of women mixing in
political parties has ended weeks
of debate on the subject. The move
had backing from all three parties
although they had no vote on the
decision. .

Some stipulations were put on
‘the approval, however, as ‘women
will be permitted to slate positions
on Student Congress only. WSGA
is still immune from party‘ voice.
Representatives of the following
groups composed the voting com-
mittee: two each from MC, SC,
and WSGA, and one each from the
DOW and DOM. ,

Wrestlers, Tankers Win Again

For the" second straight year,
Pitt’s’ winter sports kings, wrest-
lingand swimming, came through
with Eastern Collegiate titles over
the weekend.

For the wrestlers, it was their
second straight since gaining en-
trance into the Eastern Wrestling
Association last season. The tri-
umph was very close with the
Panthers 51 points just topping
Penn State’s 50.

Astor the swimmers, they set a

unprecedented record in securing
their fourth consecutive Eastern
swim title. They topped, nearest
rival Rutgers by 21 points, amass.
ing seven first places.

Individual champions in wrest-
ling included Joe Solomon, Ed
Peery, and Bill Hulings. In swim-
ming, Skippy Monsein, Jim Zurch-
er, and Warne White were the
honor men. For further details on
both events, see the sports pages.

Panhellenic Ball
Honors Pledges
At Webster Hall

One hundred and twenty-
six will be honored by all
sorority Women Friday, Mar.
18, at the annual Panhellenic
Ball; Bill Leroy and his or-
chestra will play at the dance
in the Georgian Room of Web-
ster Hall Hotel from 9 p.m. to
1 a.m.

Two ceremonies will be held
during intermission. For the ﬁrst

time, members of Panhellenic
Council who have served for three

years will be presented with an
award for their service. There are
ﬁve such senior members.

New pledgesewill then be called
to the stage in’ individual sorority
groups and will be given white
carnation corsages.- Fall plegdes
will also be recognized. They will
form a guard of honor, holding
ribbons through which the new
pledges will walk. The ﬁrst dance
after intermission will "be for
pledges and dates only.

Shirley McCauley, chairman of
the dance, has announced that
second semester senior women

who are not in a sorority may
attend the dance if they wish.

Tickets may be purchased from

the Panhellenic members of each
sorority at $3.50 per couple.

 

Free Filth
For Next Year

University administration
vetoed ‘ free ﬁfth hours for
next semester, as a result of
increased student enrollment
and a lack of classroom space.
The decision was made at a
meeting held last Monday.

The scheduling committee could
ﬁnd no means by which to cope
with next year’s necessary classes
except by using the ﬁfth hour,

according to Dean of Men, Theo-
dore W. Biddle.

“Administrative oﬂicers be-
lieve in the principle and philo-
sophy of free time in the mid-
dle of the day for meetings, re-
laxation, and lunch, "and they
want it. But the practical prob-
lem of scheduling classes makes
this impossible. I am sure stu-
dents and student activities will
accommodate themselves to this
need,” he said. -

The deans agreed to give stu-
dents a “reasonable number” of
free hours for special assemblies,
meetings, rallies, etc., as has been
the practice before the free ﬁfth
hour wentinto effect.

Stephen Foster Memorial Hall
and the YM & WHA had to be
utilized this year to counteract the

twelve per cent reduction of class .

space caused by free ﬁfth hours.
This semester, a few ﬁfth hour
classes had to be scheduled be-
cause of space needed for addition-

al classes.

Primary issues considered during the congress session

Were bills on Foreign Eastern Af—¢

Eastern Affairs Committee. A
decision couldn’t be reached on

chairman of the Pitt delegation
for this bill, walked out of the
meeting with his proposal and

Those who walked out made
up the majority part of the
initial committee and a minor-

committees later made up bills
to present to the general as-

twelve bills were read, a legis-

What‘ young people are doing atGeneral Electric

Young engineer
is responsible for
design analysis
of $3,000,000
turbine-generators

The average large steam turbine-generator.
costs $3,000,000 and takes two years to build.

It is one of the biggest pieces of'electr1cal

equipment made. Yet its-thousands of parts

are put together as carefully as a ﬁne watch.

Even a small change in design can affect the

stresses and vibration ofthe turbine, and
the way it performs. At General Electric,
several men share the responsibility of pre-
dicting those effects before _the turbine is
built. One of them is 29-year-old E. E.
Zwicky, Jr.

His job: analytical engineer

Here’s what Ted Zwicky does. Hetakes
a proposed mechanical design feature, de-
scribes it mathematically, breaks it down
into digestible bits, modiﬁes it, and ‘feeds it
to electronic computers. (It may take two
months to set up a problem; the computers
usually solve it in twenty minutes.) Then
Zwicky takes the answers from the com-
puters, translates and interprets them so they
can be followed by design engineers.

23,000 college graduates at General Electric

This is a responsible job. Zwicky was readied
for it in a careful program of development.
Like Zwicky, each of our 23,000 college-
graduate employees is given a chance to ﬁnd
the work he does best and to realize his full
potential. For General Electric believes this:
When young minds are given freedom to
make progress, everybody beneﬁts—the in-
dividual, the company, and the country.

only. According to Pope, over 500
people requested that the pro-
duction be held over so they could
see it a second time.

Only 650 tickets for the three
performances will be sold. Tickets
will go on sale at the Student
Desk Apr. 1 and for the ﬁrst time
mail orders are now being'accept-

ed. Block ticket orders may be
made through the Pitt Players
Office, 1309 C1. ‘

Health Professions Plays Active Part

By SAM MORTON
Second of a Series
Beside turning out graduates in the health professions,
the University’s Medical Center has for many years been
‘doing important work in improvi_ng professional working
conditions in the ﬁeld of medicine and public health.
Many of the Center’s projects receive attention only in
the medical ﬁeld, but they play a vital part in the attention

and care received when one enters a hospital or goes to a

doctor for treatment. 9

A Strong Weelr

Engineers‘ week at the University of Pittsburgh has be-
come a tradition in the short space of_ two years. One of
the primary concepts of the week was and is to provide a
good time for the engineering students at the University-
But it has become something much more than this.

Public relations at a school as large as Pitt are a com-
plex and often discouraging task. Events such as Engineers
Week .serve as vehicles of public relations even though
such may not have been the original intention. Today a high
school open houseprogram is underway. Over 800 high
school students are expected to attend this affair. Each de-
partment in the ﬁeld of engineering has sponsored a dis-
play and provided student guides for the occasion. The en-
tire day will serve as a preview for each high school student
who is considering engineering as his profession. They are
not only seeing a ﬁne school but also meeting the group of‘
student leaders /who planned and arranged the events.

The various repercussions of the week will be felt in a
wider area than most realize. Since it is unique, it has gain-
ed the attention "of people all over the country and thus-
acts as a far ﬂung public relations project without having
been designed as such. ’ V »

~ , The ever elusive term called school spirit is ‘exemplified
in the week. Green hats have materialized all over the
campus. Engineering students have emerged from their labs

and‘ united in order to push the week and all that it stands
for. - _- V ‘ J '

“The Time ;iHas‘ Come,"

The Walrus Said,

, By Irv Rofhmon

.Like little dormant seeds, Student Congress
members have had to wait until envrionmental
conditions were proper before sprouting. And
now, surprise! ' surprise! with elections only two
weeks off, they’ve begun to show signs of positive
geotropism——-of coming out into the open with a
program worthy of the leading student group.

It’s been a struggle we admit.
Sclons have been obviously dis-
couraged by failure to revive the ,
inter—city damage rally pact
which held students responsible
for damage incurred during vic-
tory rallies. Revival of the Pan-
ther was too much, so they turn-
ed it over to publications.

The ‘student discount fund is
lagging, despite original enthusi-
asm. It seemed to be a good idea to get merchandise
discounts for students from Oakland merchants.
But it takes work. And that has been lacking
among congressional electees this year.

After almost two years of attempting to attain
squater’s rights here, the public relations commit-
tee posted “Be Proud of Pitt” signs. If anyone
reads them, he’ll ﬁnd out that “The Pitt Evening
School May Be the Oldest in the Country--it dates
back to 1796.” Nothing like being sure.

But at long last afew hearty solons have found
sitting on their cans worse than getting on the
ball. And the programs, presently being sponsored
by SC have stimulated student enthusiasm as well
as faculty interest: popular movies, political par-
ties, “and student-faculty discussions.

Room G-24 has been packed for showings of
“Young Man With a Horn” and “Streetcar Named
Desire” shown yesterday and today. If students w_ill
crowd in with both fraternity men and independents
to enjoy an SC-sponsored project then it’s a step in
the right direction. An effective program will even-

 

 

 

l

in elections by joining three parties——including
women. There’ll be a major turnout for voting
Mar. 30. But with extra competition, posts will
have greater meaning and victorious politicians will
have to work hard in the coming year to earn
them. The word “politicians” will then connote the
upstanding and considerate policy maker that it
should.

But as far as this columnist is concerned, the
student-faculty discussigns which have been started
will have more far—reaching implications than either

of the others. “The time has come, the Walrus said,

“to talk of many things.”

It’s about time that such discussions which will
concern any things that students might wish to
discuss, come about. SC advisors have been sug-
gesting them for years. If it proves successful
it will be the main accomplishment of the present
administration.

Last Monday, twelve students gathered in the
Norwegian room to try to ﬁnd out just what we
want in student unions.

Some of the ideas that came out of the dis-
cussion?—music rooms, recreation and game rooms,
possibly a swimming room, cafeteria facilities
enough for banquets, music for dancing. Someone
suggested that it would be a good idea to look
into what other student unions had in order to
ﬁnd‘ out what our potential might be. Someone
suggested that we concern ourselves with costs,
also. .

We found out that an MC representative and a
WSGA representative are now serving on a special
faculty committee to discuss student unions. Did
anyone know about it? '

That discussion was lead by SC advisor Dr.
James T. Liu. Next Monday, ﬁfth hour, Dr. Russell
Ferguson, head of the history department will dwell
on the question “Is social» life leading Pitt students
away from study?” .

Later, the students and faculty might discuss

tually lead to more student interest

functions.

Because it concerns both men and women, poli-
tical parties, originated by Men’s Council, is ,§C’s
baby. Almost 900 students have shown interest

in school

. vision or radio or student unions again.

Progress of Generations . . . -

Education Moves On, . 

By Cecy Lincoff‘

The wheels of ed1fc':‘a’tion are
constantly on the move and little
does the student mind know it
until hevbecomes aware of what
he thinks is a drastic change in
methods.

_This was the recent situation
in the biology
d e p a r t ment
when a hand-
full of upper-
c 1 a ssmen is-
s u e d c o m-
p 1 a in t s be-
cause the in-
structors were
c 1 a m p in g
d o w n. T h e
In a j o rity of
the class, be-
_ ing composed

of freshman, did not rebell as

violently as did their senior
classmates. However, they too
felt that they were being treated
on a rather highschoolish level.
Thus, the press looked into the
matter. First the head of the
' biology department was con-
tacted and consented to let the
professor in charge of the course
explain the reasons for the mid-

 

year addition to the policy.

The professor, in turn, chatted
with’ this ‘reporter and compiled
an explanation on the back-
ground for the Nature Study
course, its previous ' teaching
methods, and why the change had
come about this past February.

Nature Study IS a course in
biological sciences designed to
give basic knowledge skills, at-
titudes, and appreciations in this
area to students who plan to_ be-
come elementary school teachers.
Usually it is taken in the fresh-
man year. The ﬁrst actual re-
vision step taken was back‘ in
1953 when, to achieve these pur-
poses, the faculty composed a

questionnaire to learn student

opinion.’

Since‘ then gradual changes
have been taking place in the de-
partment--a, new textbook was
adopted to furnish a reading
-background for some portions of
the course, laboratory manuals
were compiled, visual aids were
employed, and living material
was brought into the laboratory.
The responses of the students
made the faculty undertake the
further changes this semester.

Mass Cheering Section

will become as familiar a word to
the football fan as the women
cheerleaders or the Pitt Varsity
Marching Band is now.

Main purpose of the Block P
is to provide a strong cheering
section. Due to Pitt’s streetcar
atmosphere, ‘many people feel
thatan attempt to create a cam-
pus school type of cheering
crowd is impossible. But why
should it be?

The University of Californiaat
Los Angeles, which is also a
commuter-type school has a suc-
cessfulﬂash card section. In fact,
their excellent precision and
clever ideas rated them a full
«page with colored pictures in
Life magazine in Nov., 1953.

Here’s how the ﬂash card sys-

by the present students. Rather

by the students‘. _

Looking further into the_prob-
lem, it seems that just this type
of thing is going on every day
of the semester all over the Uni-
versity. The only trouble is, no
one can actually put a ﬁnger on
it. It is employed by instructors
who realize that the students
seem bored and‘ dissatisﬁed with
his methods of teaching.

It’s a compliment to' the stu-
dent to have him know that he is
constantly being considered by
his professor. ,

This “situation seems to have
opened a new outlook on aca-
demic freedom. Students actu-
ally are the controlling factor in
deciding the instructor’s teach-
ing methods and policy.

If this is true, Pitt has some-
thing really to be proud of. It
is keeping up with the progress
of the generations, and this is a
wonderful thing.

Approval has been secured

- Donald C. Pote asksf

What bearing
  would my ﬁeld  
of training have
on my assignments
at Du Pont?

DONALD C.'POTE will receive his B.S. degree in Mechanical

. ” Engineering from Princeton University this June. He’s been

~ quite active in interclub athletics——football, basketball and

baseball-—and served a term as Club Athletic Director. He’s

also found time to work on “The Princeton Engineer” as Asso-

ciate Editor. Right now, Don is making‘ thorough plans for his
employment after graduation. A A ' ' ‘

“Chuck” N oren answers:

The answer to that is easy, Don, if you mean initial assign-
ments. Generally speaking, a graduate’s ﬁrst assignment is
inﬂuenced by his previous training and his expressed interest
in a particular type of work. Whenever possible, Du Pont
assigns a man to the type of work he is trained for and wants
—he’ll do better in any ﬁeld if he’s highly interested. For
example, my master’s thesis was on the useof explosives,
and my ﬁrst Du Pont assignment was a study’ of the eﬂi-
ciency of explosives. D -

But experience on the job really constitutesnew training.
You learn about other branches of science and engineering—-
you broaden your horizons through daily contacts with
men having other skills. The result is that arbitrary divi-
sions between technical branches gradually dissolve, and
you become ready for new assignments and new responsi-
bilities-even outside" your original ﬁeld. In my own case, I
developed quite a bit of skill in mechanical and civil engi-
neering techniques when I was called upon to supervise the
“shooting” of an experimental tunnel for the evaluation of
new explosives-—even though my original training was in
mining engineering.

Of course, specialization in a deﬁnite ﬁeld may be con-
tinued if the man speciﬁcally wants it and reveals a talent
for it. The best opportunities for that are in research and
development. Naturally, the value of this kind of work is
also recognized at Du Pont.

So, no matter What your initial assignment may be, Don,
Du Pont is anxious to bring out your best. A good rule to
remember is this. A graduate’s ﬁrst assignment is often nec-
essarily based on his ﬁeld of training and his degree, but his
subsequent progress at Du Pont is always based on his dem-
onstrated ability. .

AAU Track and

Track Coach Carl Olson has an-¢
nounced that this year’s Univers-
ity Championships have been
cancelled. The reason given was
that the Field House bleachers
will have to remain up for the
WPIAL basketball ﬁnals. Last
year’s tourney, the first held since
1941, was open to all men who
had not gained a varsity letter in
track.

Even though the championships
have been cancelled, track is still
very much. in the limelight.

The senior AAU Track and
Field meet will be held Mar. 26,
at Schoonmaker Hall, showing the
freshmen as well as the varsity.

Fresh Paul Trash from Schenley,
who captured the high hurdles
three years in a row during his
high school competition, and the
PIAA quarter-mile two years run-
ning, will be running in this meet.

Bob Carper will also be making-

his first appearance at Schoon-
maker Hall. Carper was a WPIAL
champ in the 100-yard dash and
placed in the ﬁrst ﬁve in last
year’s PIAA State championships.

Other promising freshmen in-
clude Bob Rush, hurdler and mile
relay man, and Perry Jones, win-
ner of the Junior AAU 1000-yard

THE STUDENT COUNCIL

Todaylet us, investigate a phenomenon of American college
life called the student council. First of all, what is the student
council? The answer is simple: the ‘student council is a council
of students.

Next, what does the student council do? Again the answer is
simple: it meets. .

Next, what goes on at the meetings? This question is rather
more complicated than the others. Perhaps it can best be an-
swered by reproducing here the minutes of a typical meeting
