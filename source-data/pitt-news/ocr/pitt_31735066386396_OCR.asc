‘U’ of distinguished

  Oakland residents  

register complaints
about student actions

 By Jim Wechsler

Staff Writer

The degenerating relationship
between South Oakland residents
and students who share that
neighborhood was the focus of a
special City Council meeting held
Tuesday.

At issue were complaints

1 lodged by longtime residents of

the community regarding the
behavior, especially during
weekend parties, of many
students who live in South
Oakland.

Pat Scanlon, executive director
of the South Oakland Citizens’
Council, said that she was
concerned about the students’

"' “total disrespect of and lack of

concern for the community, and
arrogance about their roles [as
members of the communityl.”
Scanlon said most of the
complaints brought up during
the conference centered around
the inappropriate behavior of
students during parties and their
general disrespect for both state

1, law and city ordinances.

She cited many examples of
the kinds of regulations ignored
by weekend partygoers, including
disturbing the peace, drinking
alcoholic beverages on the street,
vandalizing, littering, breaking fire
codes and charging money for
admission to parties which serve
alcohol to minors, a practice
Scanlon likened to the running of
a speakeasy.

John Cord, a Pitt senior who
lives in South Oakland, said that
the residents should be able to
live with the students.

“The residents have been here
for the longest time. lt’s not like
they [the students] snuck up on
them. If they aren’t prepared to
live that lifestyle with the students,
then they should get out.” Cord

C said that the students need to live

closer to the university because
they have to commute.

“Where else are the students
going to live?” he asked.

Scanlon said that this attitude
contributes to the
between the residents and the
students.

Social services urgec.

to unite against drugs

By William Graves
For The Pitt News

The effects of drug and alcohol
abuse on society are

‘overwhelming social—service

organizations trying to deal with
the problem, according to one
United Way official.

“The negative social effects are
so vast, and our social services
are uncoordinated and
fragmented," said John
McCormick of the United Way.

McCormick was among a panel
speakers
yesterday at the opening round
table for SSDI, The Working
Conference on Social Service
Delivery Issues.

According to mediator Dr.
Vivian L. Fuller, the discussion
had three goals: to summarize
what is happening with drug and
alcohol abuse within each

F’ represented agency, what their

drug policies are and how these
policies are affecting their
agencies.

Dr. Oscar Bukstein of the
Adolescent Drug Abuse and
Psychiatric Treatment program
at Western Psychiatric Institute 8:
Clinic, is concerned with the

‘relationship between drug abuse

and psychological disorders.
“One problem feeds upon the
other and causes a downward

spiral,” said Bukstein. He
emphasized the importance of
treatment. “If you treat the
psychological problems, the drug
and alcohol problem‘ will go
away.”

Bukstein, as well as the other’

panelists, felt that treatment and
rehabilitation must be aimed at
individuals who are at high risk.

According to Dr. Ralph Tarter, a
professor of psychiatry at Pitt, it is
imperative that young children be
educated about the dangers of
drug and alcohol abuse.

“By not solving the problem at
age seven, we have to solve it at

' 12 or 20 or 60. Most kids get into

drugs and out of drugs, but we
have to target the ones who don't
get out of them," said Tarter.
According to McCormick,
substance abuse is the No.1 social
and economic problem facing
communities. He said that the
only way prevention and
rehabilitation can be effective is if
the social agencies join together.
This “portfolio team" will
reinforce good social service
programs and redirect sources of
money, said McCormick. He said
that 144 social service agencies
exist in Allegheny county.
“Many good places exist; they
are out there, but they need to be
coordinated,” McCormick said.

Search needs staff,‘ expert says

By Jennifer Calabrese

News Editor

Pitt’s presidential search committee needs a
staff member to be complete, according to John
Corbally, presidential-search expert.

“I have suggested to the chairman of the
search committee that it would be in my view a
good idea to add a representative of the staff of
the university to that committee. As vital as I
know administrators and faculty members are, if
the university had only administrators and faculty
members and no staff members it would be a
pretty strange, unusual and inefficient place,”
Corbally told a meeting of Pitt’s University
Senate yesterday. His address was titled,
“Searching for Excellence for the Institution and
for the President.”

Corbally, a former president of the University
of Illinois and of Syracuse University, came to
campus to help Pitt “develop a vision” of what

the new president should be like, according to
University Senate President Barbara Shore. Pitt
President Wesley Posvar is planning to leave the
university at the end of this academic year.

Pitt should seek experience, confidence,
character and understanding when looking for a
new president, Corbally said.

“There are a number of men and women who
can bring those traits to you. You do not need to
approach the search with a sense of desperation
or with a religious fervor," he said.

Corbally cautioned the committee against
taking its task too seriously.

“To be perfectly frank and honest, in an
institution such as the University of Pittsburgh, a
strong comprehensive university with a
distinguished history and an equally distinguished
present day, will survive whatever choice is
made,” Corbally said.

Corbally also addressed the issue of the

Space. The ﬁnal frontier. These
are the voyages of the IML-2
Space Shuttle, an aircraft which is
the focus of a newly funded NASA
mission commencing at Pitt.

The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration has given
the University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine’s department of
psychiatry the nod to begin the
initial phase of an investigation
on changes in human-behavior
patterns during space travel.

According to Timothy H. Monk,
Ph.D., an associate professor of
psychiatry, director of the human
chronobiology program at Pitt
and the head of the space study,
the peculiar environmental
conditions that astronauts face
on a mission of this nature can
predictably lead to disturbed 24-
hour behavior patterns or can

circadian rhythms.

The investigation, which hopes
to develop a more thorough
comprehension of how humans
adapt to space travel, is un-
precedented, according to Monk.

“This is the first space—based
study that integrates sleep,
circadian rhythms and work
performance. We will be
examining human behavioral and
physiological cycles in an
environment distinct from the
normal temporal environment on
Earth,” Monk said.

“Special environmental
conditions, such as sharing
cramped living quarters with
several people and the lack of
earth-bound time cues during the
mission, may lead to disruptions
in circadian rhythms. This, in
turn, can cause poorer sleep,
degraded work performance and
impairments in mood,” Monk

Although the actual launch is
not scheduled until April 1995,
measures have already been taken
to prepare for the mission.

“A process of negotiations with
NASA is the first step to be taken
— a step which allows us to
arrive at a compromise of what
exactly is possible," Monk said.

Once negotiations are
complete, a very detailed
experiment document will be
drawn up.

“An experiment document is a
3—inch—thick document that
specifies exactly what is going to
happen in the study,” Monk said.
“It will specify time—line
requirements, methods of
astronaut training, what
apparatuses will be necessary —
things of that nature."

Another aspect that the study
will focus on is a finer

Greeks need to change or risk extinction

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Sta_ﬂ' W.-uer

Fraternities and sororities will

"follow the path of the dinosaurs

if they fail to adopt new policies
to cope with the changes in
modern society, according to
Gary Bonas, associate director of
student activities at Villanova
University and national director
of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.
“We are the dinosaurs of the

9 20th century. The dinosaurs are

dead, we are told, because they
were unable to change with the
changing environment.

“That is the same argument
people are using against us. They

say fraternities and sororities
. refuse to change. They won’t

face the facts of their problems,
and as a result, in not changing
they too will become extinct,”
Bonas said.

Bonas was at Pitt to speak to
Greeks as part of the ongoing
Greek 101 series.

“There are many problems we
could focus on  alcohol, risk
management, sexism, anti-

academic attitudes, elitism,
racism, and ﬁnally, the problem
we are going to focus on, hazing.
Probably if we do nothing about
these problems while you're here,
when you come back as an
alumnus, you will have no chapter
to return to. It’s that serious; it’s

ter, larger things develop and
the fraternity can get in trouble,
Bonas said.

-Bonas posed a litmus test for
hazing. He asked each fraternity
and sorority to consider:

-if there is a risk of physical,
mental or emotional injury

if we do nothing about these problems while
you 're here, when you come back as an
alumnus, you will have no chapter to return

to. It’s that serious.

-—Gary Bonas

that serious,” Bonas said.
Bonas formed a hazing
continuum and posed possible
examples of hazing. After citing
some examples of situations that
may or may not be hazing and
having volunteers rank the
activity, he explained that a hazing
continuum is not really a
continuum but a sliding board. It
is easy to start on things that are
“sort of hazing,” but too soon

-if they, as active members,

q if they would be comfortable
describing this event in court in

“Why do we do it? Power: your
ability to exercise control.
Tradition: We’ve always done it.
Revenge: I was hazed. Guess
what? Hazing is totally
unacceptable in our society.

“It’s dangerous. Fifty people
have died, and countless more
have been physically injured or
mentally scarred by hazing
incidents. It does not promote
what we are about. Please tell me
how hazing shows respect for
human dignity," he said.

Bonas spoke of pledging as a
developmental process that takes
a pledge to the ideal level of
brother or sisterhood.

“It’s carefully planned and not
haphazard. It’s a very risky
process, but if we don’t do it, we
won’t survive. It’s like the chapter
putting their arm around that
new brother or sister and guiding
him or her,” Bonas said.

Europe integrating after changes

’ By Daniel Orr .

For The Pitt News

‘ The sweeping changes in the
policies of the Soviet Union and
Eastern European countries over
the last year have promoted
international integration,
according to two Pitt professors.

Jonathan Harris, a professor of
political science, talked about
the disintegration of the
Communist institutions in the
USSR at a lecture sponsored by
the Center for Russian and East
European Studies yesterday.

Until about five years ago the
Soviet government was controlled
entirely by the Communist Party
and its full-time officials, he said.
Each station of command
supervised and controlled the
lower powers in a vertical chain
of command down to the local
governments. In this way the
nation could be ruled completely
by the Communist Party members
on top. 0

“[They] had a gross style of
leadership. They ordered
everyone around and treated all
others as unimportant,” said
Harris. The local powers could

do nothing but take orders from
their superiors.
However, Harris said that when

‘Gorbachev took command, he

attempted to change this
situation. He worked on
improving interpersonal relations
between the higher and lower
powers and with the common
people. He gave more power to
the representative divisions of
the government and provided a
larger variety of candidates for
the vote.

According to Harris, the nation
made moves toward enterprise
and the free market, giving the
Soviet Union a capitalist flair, as
well as moving toward
democracy. The decrees of the
officials were replaced by
legislation from representatives.

Harris said that in 1990
Gorbachev feared his new
democracy had gone too far and
tried to re—centralize his
government by creating a new
institution, the Presidential
Council, as well as the position
of president. These groups re—
asserted authority over the
legislatures but did not destroy
them completely, creating a

healthy balance, according to
Harris.

The nations of Eastern Europe
have likewise undergone changes ‘ "
in their policies and have made
moves toward international
integration. Political science
professor Alberta Sbragia noted
that Europe is well on its way to
becoming united but will maintain
its cultural diversity.

“Europe is absent in cultural
integration,” said Sbragia.
Students of those countries have
been exposed to the different
cultures but are encouraged to
retain their own, he said.

The European Community, a
forming international
government,‘ has already
established judicial power over
the many national courts,
according to Sbragia. Also, he
said that the national banks in
Europe cooperate with EC to
form a strong monetary policy,
which has improved the exchange
rate in the European economy. '

However, Sbragia said the.
integration process is lacking in a
decision-making body and is
failing to create a unified culture
of “East Europeans”.

Tailgating at games
is a Pitt tradition

By Jennifer swoboda A

For T be Pitt News

Though many students drink before and during Pitt football
games, the main concern of campus and city police seems to
be the drinking that goes on in Oakland after the game.

“There is a problem with drinking in the stadium, but it is less
of a problem than it has been in the past,” said Walt Waters,‘
assistant director of campus security.

“However, this department, along with the city of Pittsburgh
Police, hears numerous complaints from Oakland residents in
regard to Pitt students having parties on Bates Street and the
surrounding area. We hear that it is getting totally out of hand,
and unless some moderation is used, there will be some drastic
measures taken to control the situation,” Waters said.

According to Tina Kiriakou, a ticket taker at Pitt Stadium for
Gate 7, alcohol problems are minimal at home games.

Students cite several reasons for drinking before and after a
game. ‘

“When it’s sunny outside on the day of a game, what is there
better to do?” said Pitt graduate Alex Basso. Many of his peers
seemed to say much of the same thing. Kevin Carlin, a Pitt

, senior, said, “People drink before a game to loosen up and get

into the flow of everything and to have lots of fun, and that’s
important.” ’

“[1 drink] for the social aspect; before the game I just like to
enjoy myself and get psyched for the game,” said graduate
student Colleen Malloy.

“I basically drink in the morning before a game to get rid of
last night’s hangover,” said Pitt graduate Greg Werchowski.

Senior John Simon said, “It’s purely a traditional thing. I get
no enjoyment out of it.”

_ According to The Pittsburgh

Herman Mitchell said that city
police had cracked down and
stopped 12 parties over the
weekend, but that he lacked the
number of police to stage such
operations regularly.

City Council member Eugene

Ricciardi felt that a larger police

neutralize the increasing
problems in Oakland, according
to the Post-Gazette.

Scanlon agreed with Ricciardi’s
views. She said that the nature of

have surfaced in the last few
years are more serious than in
the past.

Scanlon added that there are
many students residing in the
neighborhood who are not
involved with the problems, and
that some of them have even
raised complaints of their own.

Scanlon said that the students
need to take into consideration
the rights of the city residents.

“I just ask every student to
imagine their parents,
grandparents or loved ones
having to live next door to the

activities they’re either part of or
aware of,” said Scanlon.

She mentioned instances of
vandalism, threats and excrement
left on residents’ properties as
some activities that the
neighborhood residents are
unwilling to tolerate.

Scanlon said that students need
to understand that they are part
of the communities in which they
reside and have the privileges
and obligations that accompany

this right. She said that they can
either help to improve the
conditions in which they live, or
they can hinder growth and
community life, depending upon
the decisions they make.

Scanlon added that as long as
students see themselves as

separate from the neighborhood, A

there will continue to be conflicts
between the residents and the
students.

 ...ofPz'z‘tsburgb.?

The purpose of an educational institution, whether as

a university, trade school or otherwise, is to educate its

students. Unfortunately, big colleges in this area are more
likely to turn into big businesses than anything else.

An example of this is Carnegie Mellon. This is not to be

confused with Carnegie Mellon University because the

., _“University” has been dropped from the official name of

1 the school.

Carnegie Mellon recently laid off 17 workers because of
what it called a budget crisis. This crisis, however, was
given a slight reprieve, when on the same day, the school
announced its acceptance of a $5 million construction

COI1tI'3.Ct.

Former CM President Richard Cyert said, “Carnegie
Mellon’s appetite continues to grow the larger [it] gets.” In

« the middle of a “budget crisis,” however, this appetite has
now eaten the jobs of these 17 workers, instead of helping

to feed their families.

The University of Pittsburgh is not exempt from this
status as a big business. When Pitt runs into budget
problems, it cuts jobs or initiates a hiring freeze. The best
example of this is the recent demotion of six workers in

the facilities-management department.

These jobs were eliminated because of financial
 constraints. Also because of these restraints, Pitt has been
under a hiring freeze for the last seven months. Yet Pitt
recently hired Larry W. Keeler as environmental director,

a new position created during this so-called “hiring

freeze.”

In both instances the school completely disregarded the
workers’ loyalty and years of service by coldly eliminating

their jobs.

of its workers.

Pitt is the single largest employer in the city of Pittsburgh.
But even with its “hiring freeze,” it always has enough
“ "money to keep creating jobs and expanding.

Because of its ever-increasing size, the university has ‘
been trying to build another dormitory complex. This
project has been estimated at a cost upward of $40

million.

If the university is able to keep expanding like it is, it
should also be able to protect the jobs of the people who
work there, instead of sacrificing them to its own appetite

for expansion.

But Pitt’s expansion does not stop just by the elimination
of jobs. The University of Pittsburgh owns large chunks
of Oakland, such as apartment buildings, stores and
hospitals. Though Pitt’s “appetite” for real estate in
Oakland seems to be growing, it is coming at the expense

Israel cannot deal with PLO

I am writing this letter in
response to the unsigned editorial
printed on Oct. 15. The writer of
the editorial seemed to think that
the state of Israel has never made
any move for peace. In 1979 the
state of Israel gave up the Sinai
peninsula, which is three times
the size of the territory Israel now
holds, ‘in order to make peace
with Egypt. Furthermore, the state
of Israel’s military symbol has a
rifle with an olive branch next to
it; the olive branch is a symbol of
peace.

The anonymous writer of the
article claimed that the occupation
was very harsh. Israel’s
occupationis a very liberal one.
The standard of living of the
Arabs in the occupied territories
is better than the standard of
living in Lebanon, Syria, Egypt or
Jordan.

The author of the article was
also quite unaware about some
facts concerning the [Palestine
Liberation Organization] and the
occupied territories. The PLO was
founded in Egypt in the year 1964
for the sole purpose of destroying
Israel. The state of Israel did not
even have an occupation until
1967. As far as who the territory
belongs to, it is undoubtedly
Israel’s. In 1917 the Balfour
Declaration from the British
promised all the territory west of
the "Jordan River for an
independent Jewish state. The
West Bank was part of that
promised territory; however, in
1948 when the Arab states
maliciously took aggression
against Israel, they took the West
Bank away from her. In 1967 the
state of Israel regained the territory
that was rightfully hers.

I should hope that the writer of
the editorial remembers Pan Am
Flight 103. David Gould, a
professor from the University of
Pittsburgh, was killed with others
on a plane ﬂight that was bombed
by the PLO. The PLO has recently
aligned itself with Iraq and Libya,
two clear enemies of the United
States. What rational individual

would support negotiation
between Israel and this
outrageous terrorist organization,
the PLO, after knowing these
facts?

When the United Nations
Security Council voted to
condemn Israel, the countries
filled with blatant Jew-hatred
couldn’t wait to vote on the
condemnation. Countries such as
Ethiopia and Yemen have a long
history of persecuting theirjewish
citizens and voted on the
condemnation happily. The
Soviet Union, a very anti-Semitic
country, gladly voted on the

Letters

condemnation as well. The United
States claims it voted on the
condemnation in order to
maintain its good relations with
the Arab states aligned against
Iraq. I should hope that is the
reason why because I would hate
to think that Thomas Peckering is
an anti-Semite.

I hope that in the future that
more people will realize the
circumstances that Israel is in
before making quick
assumptions.

Coming home to a. mess

Traditionally, homecoming is
supposed to be a campus-wide
celebration in which everyone
takes pride in being a part of the
university. We choose a king and
queen to form a selected court
which is supposed to reflect the
values of the university. ’

A beautiful group of candidates
ought to symbolize a beautiful
campus to which they belong.
But what have these candidates
done this year to our university?
They've disgraced it by making it
an utter mess.

For example, many
homecoming candidates get their

friends living in the quad
dormitories to hang sheets outside
their windows with JANE DOE
FOR QUEEN painted all over
them. It's great to win someone’s
support that way, but these signs
are often neglected. After a good
thunderstorm they get ripped
down, or the paint runs all over
the building. In particular, Amos
Hall looked like it belonged to a
slum after the rain on Saturday,
Oct. 6. And that’s the way we
show our school spirit and pride
in the university!?

Consider this: You can’t step in
any classroom in campus without
being blinded by five or six
smiling faces plastered on every
wall within the room. One of my
classrooms had a total of 14!
Many students either view these
signs as distractions, or they find
them amusing to deface.

Finally, we mustn’t forget what
happens on election day.
Whoever dreamed up the idea of
handing out fliers in front of
election sites ought to be given a
broom, dustpan, and argarbage
bag to clean up the areas after the
election. The area from the
Litchﬁeld. Towers through the
quad dorms to the front of the
William Pitt Union was literally
carpeted with all those smiling
faces that most students have by
now grown weary of seeing.

Don’t get me wrong, though. I
do believe in keeping the tradition
of homecoming_alive, and I did
indeed vote on last Monday. But
I believe that anyone who feels
qualified to be a homecoming
candidate ought to be a little
more courteous towards the

university community. Let's keep '

Pitt beautiful; after all, that’s what
you candidates out there are

symbolizing.

Pennsylvania band STAND UP!

By Eric Hoch
 When one thinks of bands from

Pennsylvania, those bands usually
come from the eastern or western
part of the state. Pittsburgh has
the Floors and The Clarks, while
Philly can boast of being the
home of The Dead Milkmen and,
well, The Hooters. But recently
five individuals from Lancaster,
in the middle of the state, have
made a “stand” to make their
music heard — hence their name
STAND UPI.

Jeremy Weiss, a sophomore at
the University of Pittsburgh, sings
for STAND UP! and has remained
with this band since he started in
the fall of 1987 with two other
friends from school.

In the past few years STAND

opens Raygun shows

UP! has put out three different
albums. A new three—song EP
titled “That’s Real” comes out this
November.

But these are just facts that do
not give one a real understanding
of what STAND UP! is all about.
The best way to really know this
band is to hear from their leader
and vocalist Jeremy Weiss.

Pitt News: Has the band always

been called STAND UPI, and
where did this name come from?
Weiss: Yes, actually, this band
was always named STAND UP!.

There was this band, Minor
Threat, who had a song called
“Stand Up!,” and it basically said,

“Stand up; be counted.” At the
time, in my area a lot of hardcore
kids didn’t really do anything,

didn’t come to a lot of concerts.

They didn’t go out much because
they were being “slagged” on by
the local kids so much. So we
encouraged them to stand up
and be counted, as the saying
goes.

Pitt News: Do you believe
standing up and being counted is
important?

Weiss: I believe so, especially if
you want to take it on’ the

hardcore-music scene level.
Hardcore music has a limited
audience, a small number of kids.
So, if they don’t make themselves
known, if they don’t make

themselves heard, they just get _

flushed out by the majority.

As the band has grown more
than we expected it to, so has the
theme with STAND UPI. We stand
up against a lot of things, like
racism, violence, sexism, war and
discrimination of any kind.

Pitt News: Where do you see the
band going in the future?

‘Ax!’ 

Weiss: We plan to tour; we plan “

to keep releasing one to three
records a year and just keep the
ball rolling in hopes that people
respond. Naturally, if they don’t,
after college we are just going to
our little nine—to—ﬁve jobs (laughs).
Pitt News: And do whatever?
Weiss: The “normal” thing.

Pitt News: Do you have any
anecdotes from your concerts that
you would like to share?
Weiss: We were playing in a
show in Reading, Pa., at this
place called The Silo, and we
were kind of wary because we
were booked with bands called

Chicago punk greats Naked R

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

Chicago has come a long way
since the days of Upton Sinclair's
The jungle. You could say that
@aicago’s Naked Raygun might
be modern—day musical
muckrakers, but you won’t find
anyone’s missing ﬁnger in the
shrink—wrapping!

With live albums, two EPs and
five compilation projects to their
credit, Raygun has built up a
sizable following on the
. lternative circuit.

Raygun’s vocalist Jeff Pezzati
exudes a very mild, reserved
attitude. He's very soft— spoken, a
stark contrast to his brash stage
voice.

Their latest album, Raggurz 
Naleed Raygun, which is due out
by the end of October, is an
extension of 1989’s Understand,
, hich made great headway for
the band on the college charts.

“I think it’s kind of [similar]. Not
to say that it’s exactly more of the
same, but maybe it’s a little more
accessible in some ways,” says
Pezzati. “I like [Raygun  Naked
Raygun] better than any of the
others. The other albums have
really good songs on them, but

 they don’t make such great

playings to listen to the entire
album. The excitement level is
kind of relentless, where this is
more of a political album,
something you can sit down and
listen to.”

Pierre Kezdy (bass), Eric Spicer
(drums) and Bill Stephens (guitar),
along with Pezzati, complete the
bellowing quartet of Naked

3,-Raygun.

     

Chitown's Naked Raygun is a permanent ﬁxture in the alternative music scene.

For the rough town they call
home and the tough brand of
rock ‘n’ roll they play, the
members of Naked Raygun are
surprisingly clean-cut — close-
cropped hair, baby-smooth faces
and all! But don’t let the stately
look fool you — they can be just
as hard and surly as Al Capone in
their musical approach. Chicago
may have hardened them a bit,
but it’s also been a great
inspiration.

“I’d say [our ideas] just come
from life around us, things that
we’ve witnessed or dealt with. I
suppose that in every person’s

everyday travels, they see things
that either upset them or make
them excited in some way or
another,” says Pezzati. “That’s
what we write about, kind of
observations. We don’t really
preach a lot, except maybe
tongue-in—cheek. In some ways
the lyrics are wishy——washy
enough that they can be taken in
a couple different ways, which is
good because we like people to
think too.”

Just because the band doesn’t

believe in forcing their opinions
on others doesn’t mean that they
take things lightly. There’s a great
deal of understanding and insight
behind their lyrics. Take the
several references to South
America scattered throughout
Raygun’s albums.

“I think it’s the next place to be
exploited by a number of different
nations,” says Pezzati. “I think it’s
an easy one for us to talk about.
Our old guitar player was from
Columbia. He sort of made us

S—3‘

ciygun return

2, WM»_’:,‘,,., ._~.- 

Courtesy of Naked Raygun

aware of a lot of the things that
were going on there.”

While Raygun has been aware
of the situation in South America
for some time, Pittsburgh was a
more recent discovery. The fans
here have a way of making Naked

Raygun feel like they’re back in

the Windy City.

,“The following in Pittsburgh is
very good. People’s attitudes are
 like a big city with kind of an
upbeat crowd like we draw in
Chicago too, which is nice.”

A.T.S.
Armadillo Serenade

Since it debuted five years ago,
Pittsburgh's A.T.S. has been a
band that continues to run the
musical gamut. The band's
original songs (and there are
plenty of them) dabble in funk,
country, rockabilly and plain,
straight—ahead rock ‘n’ roll, with
extended solos thrown into the
mix occasionally.

It wasn’t unusual, at one point

 

WHAT IF YOII DON'T GET
INTO THE GRAD SCHOOL ,
OF YOIIR CHOICE?

Sure, there are other schools. But why
settle? Kaplan helps students raise their
scores and their chances of being admit-
ted into their first—choice schools. Fact is,
no one has helped students score higher!

EKAPLAN

in its history, to also hear an
Eddie Cochran song in the same
set as a song by jazz pianist Mal
Waldron.

The band’s previous studio
recordings unfortunately weren't
able to capture the momentum of
a live show. It made a few home
recordings that came close, but
they lacked appropriate sound
quality.

Armadillo Serenade serves as
the A.T.S. studio recording that
the band has always had the
potential to make. From the
opening downbeatof the rapid-
fire “Helsinki Town” to the end,

the energy of the songs doesn’t
let up.

The band managed to pick 14
songs that are some of its strongest
ones. It also shows how the band
has been able to merge its different
inﬂuences to get a totally unique
sound.

Guitaristjosh Arnson, who has
since left the band, contributes
two rockabilly numbers, “Bad
Say” and “Carburetor,” which
feature some authentic
rockabilly—ish lead—guitar work.

Another great thing about the
tape is the way the songs flow
from one to another. Rather than
just being a collection of A.T.S.
songs, Armadillo Serenade
sounds like an album. If you
haven’t checked out this band,
here's a perfect opportunity.
A.T.S. is one of the few bands in
town that is original and exciting.

STAND UP!

Continued from page S-2
Sly Boot, Leather Rose, and
Torment. So, we figured the first
two were most likely pop-metal,
Poison-Def—Leppard-style music,
and the last one was probably a
speed-metal band, and here we
were, this little positive hardcore
band rolling in, in our Nikes and
sweatshirts and getting ready to
jam.

So, there was predominantly a
Spandex-and-leather crowd there
with long hair, and we figured,
“What the hell. We love to play."
And we went up there, and the
people were very cool.

But there was this girl in the
front row that would not leave
me alone, and she kept heckling
us again and again. So, I would
make a couple of comments to
try to get a laugh out of the
crowd. I didn’t really want to

especially welcome.

respond in any kind of negative
way and look like a jerk because
that reflects highly on the band.

So, we have this one song
called “The Game,” and it’s pretty
much about those really conceited

people that you couldn't stand in_ ‘

your life. But with a little insight,’

if you take the time and you think
about it, it’s usually those people
who are the most insecure of all.
If you recognize that, tolerate
that and work with them, there’s
a good chance that they can be
really cool. I've experienced that;
I'm sure a lot of people have

experienced that, and it’s called?"

The Game. It’s a game that they
play to act real tough, real cool,
real hip or real manly.

So, here she was, and she kept
going on and on, and she said
something about my mother. So,
I dedicated this song, but I started
off by explaining this song. I
talked about all the people who

were just showing off in front of it'll‘

their friends or were just trying to
act real tough just to impress
people or maybe embarrassing
others because they probably
were insecure and didn’t have
the chance to do the things that
the people they made fun of did,
or maybe they didn’t have the
guts to do them, and I paused.

Then I gestured to the girl and ~

said, “Like her.”

Everyone in the place busted
out laughing, and she didn’t say
another word the entire night.
That was pretty interesting.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 18, 1990

 

Black artists recognized at Manchester Craftsrnen's Guild .

Bynmitri Ragano
Showcase Editor

One might say that this
country’s race relations are

moving like a glacier — taking
one step forward and two steps
backward simultaneously.

It’s a paradox that helps explain
the best of times/worst of times
relationship thatAfrican American
culture has with the mainstream.
On one hand black entertainers
and popular artists have finally
won fame and fortune for
brilliance in cinema, comedy and,
of course, popular music. But
blacks in the fine arts, the
“serious” arts, still suffer shameful
neglect.

Right now, Pittsburgh has a
rare opportunity to give artists of
color due recognition. Three

nationally respected black female
photographers are part of a Living

Masters and Distinguished Lecture’

series taking place at the North
Side’s Manchester Craftsmen’s
Guild, a non-profit arts
organization designed to teach
high school students and expose
artists to the surrounding low-
income, primarily black
community. Between now and
December the Manchester Guild
is featuring painter Kimberly
Camp and photographers Clarissa
Sligh and Elizabeth Sunday.
The series begins with the
Califomia—based Sunday, who will
speak at the Manchester Guild
this Friday. Sunday will discuss
her exhibit “The African
Portfolios,” the result of 15 months
spent journeying through West,
Central and East Africa. During

  
 
     
         
    
      
 
 
  
  

her travels Sunday lived in the
bush with the Masai and Turkana
peoples in Kenya and the
pygmies of Zaire.

Sunday brings a romantic,
idealized approach to this
primitive setting. In order to
“penetrate the physical world
and gain access to an inner place
of light, mystery and spirit,” she
photographs her subjects
through distorted mirrors. The
result is an elongated image —— a
real scene made larger than life.

Art aside, Sunday herself cuts
a larger—than-life figure. The
attractive, adventuresome 31-
year-old inspired Bill Cosby to
create a character on “The Cosby
Show” — a daring female
photographer who takes Denise
Huxtable as her assistant on an
African shoot. Also, Sunday
recently married Johny Spain,

one of the legendary “Soledads

Six” — a group of Black Panthers
brought to trial in the ’60s.

But even a black artist with the
experience and dynamo of

Sunday is limited to marginal
status in the American art world.
An artist's reputation and success
aren’t just determined by talent,
vision and energy; it’s also how
well you play the art—world game
of getting publicity and patronage
— a game invented and
controlled by wealthy white
society.

In a Village Voice cover story
last year on the crisis of the black
artist in white America, critic Greg
Tate wrote, “No area of modern
intellectual life has been more
resistant to recognizing and
authorizing people of color than
the world of the ‘serious’ visual
arts. To this day it remains a
bastion of white supremacy, a
sconce of the wealthy, whose
high—walled barricades are
matched only by Wall Street and
the White House. ...”

Lonnie Graham is director of
photography at the Manchester
Guild and is responsible for
bringing Sunday, Camp and
Sleigh. A fellow black artist,

Graham knows their
predicament all too well: “All of
these people have done a great
deal of work in their
communities but haven’t gained
the national notoriety that others
have.”

Graham adds that
photographers like Gordon
Parks and James Van Der Zee
who have gained recognition
only did so when they were
“old and dried—up, or dead.”

In addition, blacks in the fine
arts often meet criticism from
fellow blacks, who accuse them . ‘,~
of selling out to a white elitist
establishment. “Unfortunately,
in the black community, [artists]
are a lot of times stereotyped as
being sissies ...” The result is a
double alienation: The artist is
“too black” for the white art
world and “too white” for blacks.

Graham hopes that the Living
Masters and Lecture Series will .3.
encourage his students and 1
community: “I started trying to
look for role models for young
people that even remotely '
considered the possibility of
doing art in their lives  I also
[wanted] to put these figures up
so the students understand how
a working artist functions in the
world. It gives them perspective
about whether it’s something

The Allman Brothers
Seven Turns

Epic

The Allman Brothers’ first album
in eight years, Seven Tums has
recaptured their original white
man’s blues sound and contains
several new songs worthy of
being labeled “classic.” The
Allmans regrouped and toured in
1989 to celebrate the release of a
boxed set, Dreams,
commemorating the group’s
lengthy career. During the tour
several tracks were written that

S-7

eventually formed their new
album. Seven Turns reunites
original members Greg Allman,
Dicky Betts, Jaimoe and Butch
Trucks.

The album was produced by
Tom Dowd, who previously
worked on such Allman standards
as Idlewind South and Eat a
Peach. Incidentally, it was Dowd
who brought together the
dynamic team of Eric Clapton
and Duane Allman to form I.ayla’s
Derek and the Dominos. Duane,
Greg’s brother, died in 1971,
along with bassist Berry Oakley,
during the Eat a Peach sessions.

The two, while cycling, both
slammed into a peach truck;
obviously the album was named
with a cynical tone. Dicky Betts
was so moved by Duane’s death
that he named his son after his
former co-guitarist.

Duane Betts, now 11 years old,
plays slide guitar on one track on
Seven Turns. The instrumental
“True Gravity” features the young
Betts trading licks with his dad.
The first song on the album,
“Good Clean Fun,” captures the
Allmans at their finest: Greg’s
wailing vocals, Butch’s and

Jaimoe’s intertwining rhythms
and Betts’ searing guitar.

Another track, “Shine It On,"
can be compared to the powerful
“Whipping Post” from their first
self-titled album. It’s a traditional
Allman jam that is sure to blow
many speakersk.

With their new album, the
Allmans have proven to those
frustrated with modern pop that
they need not live in the musical
past. There's new music to fill
and satisfy their ears and hearts.

teams have been one of the bright
spots on the field this season. But
O’Brien looks like he will meet
his match on Saturday when the
5-1-1 Louisville Cardinals come
to town.

The Cardinals not only use their
special teams to augment the
offense and the defense; they
determine the outcome of games
with them. Louisville has blocked
three punts and three field goals
this season. All three f1eld—goal
blocks happened with the game’s
outcome delicately hanging in
the balance.

The first two occurred against
San Jose State in the season
opener. San Jose lined up on the
18-yard line and defensive tackle
Ted Washington smothered the
field-goal attempt on the last play
of the game. But wait. A penalty
allowed Sanjose a second attempt
but only five yards close-r this
time. Washington snuffed that
one also to preserve the 10-10 tie.

And not to be left out, free
safety Ray Buchanan blocked yet
another last-second field goal by

. Memphis State last week to allow

the Cardinals to hang onto a 19-
17 win at home and to preserve
the lofty special-teams
expectations.

Our name says it all!

Louisville to arrive with tenacious special teams  

Brian Kubiak/The Pitt News

Pitt special teams will have their work cut out for them as Louisville has decided two games with their unit.

“We’ve had solid special teams
to go along with our defense,”
said Cardinal head coach Howard
Schnellenberger. “We’ve always
worked hard on it. Of course
when you have the great success
that we had out at Sanjose when

_we blocked the two field goals

on the last play of the game, then
everybody gets excited about
blocking kicks and the special
teams.”

“Probably the most outstanding
man is Ted Washington. He’s all

Gorajewski [Pitt left guard] is going

Louisville will bring a pro

experience on defense. The
Cardinals start seven seniors on
defense, three of which make up
the linebacking unit. Six of those
seniors are contained in the

of those linebackers, Mark Sander,

already has 80 tackles (62 solo) 7

and is the major impetus of the
defense.

Louisville has been talking
about how it is are going to win
a national championship with
such talent. If not this year, then
in the near future.

“We came here to win a national
championship. Many people
think I’m out of my mind to make
those types of statements, but
they also thought that at Miami.
We’re not national-championship
caliber yet, but we’re making our
way in that direction,”
Schnellenberger said.

Schnellenberger served as the
head coach of Miami (Fla) from

1979-1984, where he compiled a
41-16 record and won the national
championship in 1983. His
Cardinals are currently ranked
No. 25 in the United Press
International poll.

But Hackett doesn’t need to
hear all about these achievements.
In fact, he’d rather not hear them
at all.

“We know our backs are to the
walls; we don’t need much extra
motivation. We know we have to
win the rest of our games,” he
said.

On offense, Cardinal QB
Browning Nagle has thrown for
almost 1,500 , yards already.

Ricky Turner's 32-yard kickoﬁ return average includes a 100-yard return for a

 

By Derek Willis
Staff Writer

Ricky Turner is back. Truth to
tell, the junior jack—of—all-trades
never left, but at the start of this
football season, Turner was
shifted to receiver because of an
overload at the tailback position.
Now, heading into the seventh
game of the season, the man
without a definite position is
fourth on the squad in all-purpose
running, which combines rushing,
receiving and return yardage.

The term “all—purpose runner”
suits Turner well, as he has lined
up at tailback and ﬂanker, as well
as returning kickoffs. The recent
development of Darnell
Dickerson at the receiver spot
has enabled Turner to return to
the familiar tailback position,
where his specialty is catching
passes out of the backfield.

Against Louisville this week
Turner could be utilized even
more from this position to offset
a heavy pass rush by catching
screen passes and blocking. “I
think that will be in the game

plan this week,” Turner says.
“But I think basically that’s my
role right now  to come out of
the backfield and catch passes.”

Previously, Turner has had a
lot of different roles. One which
he will continue to perform is
that of kick returner. The

 

Jason Billings/The itt Nws Harrisburg native sports a 32-
touchdown against WVU. yard average and a 100-yard

retum for a score vs. WestVirginia.
With the loss of Steve Israel to
knee surgery, Turner and
teammate Glenn Deveaux must
shoulder the load. But Turner is
no stranger to special teams,
having been an important
contributor since his freshman
year.

Turner’s size (6-feet-1-inch, 205
pounds) and sprinter’s speed
present a variety of problems to
opposing teams. He is one of the
fastest players and is an excellent
blocker in the backﬁeld or
downfield. His total package
makes him a natural for special
teams, and his experience makes
him a good judge of opposing
units.

Turner is impressed by
Louisville’s special teams, which
have blocked three field goals
this year. “Their special teams are
very good. All aspects are good
—— they don’t have letdowns

anywhere,” Turner says.

He compares the Cardinals’
defense favorably with
Oklahoma’s, adding, “It was like
looking at Oklahoma because
they have a lot of great athletes.
They’re not basic position-type
players.”

But then again, neither is
T umer. “I just want to do what
Coach Hackett wants me to do to

give us a different look in the_

offense,” he says. That could mean

, anything. _

P 4 THE PITT NEWS, PREGAME, Saturday, October 20, 1990
- 

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

On the Tuesday afternoon
before the Pitt-Oklahoma game,
 Curvin Richards walks into the
office of Pitt assistant athletic
director Larry Eldridge and sits
_ down.

Dressed in a Day-Glo tank top
with matching shorts and listening
to a bright yellow portable stereo,
Richards’ attire brightens up the
room almost as much as his
beaming smile and friendly
demeanor.

Swervin’ Curvin is a popular
figure this week. One of his former
high school teammates is a
Sooner, and seemingly every
newspaper in the Southwest has
been calling all day to get five
minutes with the LaPorte (Tex)
High product. Richards has been
waiting for this game since high
school, and this week he is
perhaps the most wanted man in
the Southwest.

g on the football field A

to two of the newspapers earlier
in the day but never showed up
at the scheduled time and the
reporters have been calling all
day to catch him.

But this isn’t the first time that

Richards has missed an interview “

request.

On the field Richards zips
around, almost daring defenders
to catch and tackle him, cutting
and darting about without a care
in the world.

“Sometimes I don’t even know
where my legs take me,” said
Richards after one game.

But off the field it’s a different
story. He is a private person who
would rather just be left alone to
play football and not talk to the
media.

He doesn’t like to talk about
his youth in Trinidad or his family.
and would rather talk about
teammates than himself, and

"whenever he is asked if his
running was the difference in the
game, Richards will respond,
“No, I don’t think so. We have a
lot of weapons on the team, both
on offense and on defense.”

When he does do interviews,
Richards is one of the most upbeat
and cooperative people around,
but at other times he is known to
dart out a door when a reporter
spots him and calls his name.

“Curvin does all his talking on
the field,” said running back Ricky
Turner. “He knows what he can
do. He has confidence in himself,
and he's a leader that way, a
leader by example.”

And Richards’ exploits on the
field speak for themselves. The
Panthers are 10-3-1 when he
rushes for 100 yards, and he was

a preseason Heisman Trophy ' ’

candidate before a sprained ankle
kept him out of two games. He
came back last Saturday and made
a number of brilliant runs where
— just when you thought he was
through — he burst forward for
more yardage, leading the team
to its first victory in more than a
month.

In a sport where the
participants are too often
characterized as faceless drones
hidden beneath the mask of a
battle—worn helmet, Richards
shines like a beacon. He is the
one player who everyone looks

Harris and Snell fulfill new defensive assignments

By Doug Miller
Stajf Writer

Following the embarrassing loss
to West Virginia on Sept. 29, the
Pitt football coaches claimed that
there needed to be changes made
to improve the quality of play on
the field. And changes aplenty
there were! I

Two such players who
benefited from the new moves
were linebacker Heath Snell and
defensive back Ricardo “Tinker”
Harris. Both started and made
significant‘ contributions in
stopping the Rutgers Scarlet
Knights’ offense on Saturday.

Keeping Rutgers from recording
its first victory against Pitt in eight
tries and helping the Panthers
remain in the hunt for a bowl
game were in the back of Snell's
and Harris’ minds. They were too
keyed up for the homecoming

“Roles change, and the guys
[Snell and Harris] stepped in and
played extremely well for us. We
needed quality performances
from them, and we got them,”
Panther Coach Paul Hackett said.

Harris made five tackles, four
of them solo, while also recording
his first interception for the blue-

“I felt ready for the game; I

As for Snell, he knew last week
that he would be getting the nod

for his first start. “I was pretty *

nervous also, but I just practiced
that much harder and acted like
the practices were a game. That
let some of the nervous energy
out and set [my] mind up for the
game," said Snell.

It seemed that once they got
into the action and made their

first hits, it didn’t matter that it _ ,_

was their first game starting.

“After the first few plays my
nervousness turned into intensity,
and I got geared up for them,”
Snell said.

“My heart was pounding; I
thought everyone would be able
to hear it in the huddle. I'm telling
you, the first hit is the key,” Harris
said, laughing. “After that I just
acted like it was practice and
concentrated on the job I had to
do.”

Secondary coach Nick Rapone
was pleased with the way Harris
played, saying, “He had a great
week of practice and deserved to
be in there. I didn’t say anything
special to him —— just ‘Go get
‘em.’ He didn’t blink and went

out and showed -why he is going ' " 

to be a good player here.”

As for the reported trash-talking
on the ﬁeld, both players agreed
that both teams were jawing at
one another, but Snell figured it
worked for the Panthers.

“Whenl came in during the
West Virginia game, it was really
quiet and intense. I think for the
Rutgers game we were all loose,
and that helps us play the way we
can and are supposed to,” Snell
reported.

The true freshman Harris didn’t
seemed bothered by all the talk.
“They tried to come after me a
few times, but they just made me
more prepared. It might have
backfired on them.”

With all the upcoming years
that Snell (a redshirt sophomore)
and Harris are going to provide
for the Panthers, Pitt appears to
have a solid foundation built
among these two players.
Hopefully there wouldn’t need
to be any more changes to
improve the positions Snell and
Harris now occupy.

Continued from page P-4

I"tO, guide them to victory. But

despite his amazing achievements
on the field, he is still often afraid
that the media will strike him
down.

“The media can make you as
big as they want or as little as an

‘I ant,” said Richards. “But the media

is a part of football. Sometimes
you get tired of everything, but
you just have to take it,” said
Richards. “Football players are
like actors, rock singers, the
president —-— they just have to
deal with it; it’s a part of the
game.”

Curvin S. (that's all he’1l give,

.D»his middle initial) Richards was

born A in Laventille Village in
Trinidad the day after Christmas
in 1968.

He moved to Texas at the age
of 10, when his late father took a
welding job in the United States.
Against his mother’s wishes
Richards began playing football
for a midget—league team, the
Dobbers,
immediately through the help of
his friend Donovan Forbes, now
a quarterback at the University of
Texas. .

“My mother didn't want me to
play, but IForbes’l father talked to
my mother, and she said OK,”
said Richards. “The first day of
practice, the coach put me on the

3 ‘line. But that night Donovan told

me to tell the coach that I wanted
to be a running back. The next
practice I told the coach that I
wanted to run the ball, and that's
where I stayed."

He ran the ball well enough to
become, the all—time leading
rusher and an al1—state selection
for the LaPorte Bulldogs with
3,475 yards, gaining the attention

‘ of over a dozen major colleges in

the meantime, including Pitt, Penn
State, Southern California,
University of Georgia, Louisiana
State and every school in the
Southwest Conference except
Texas.

“I liked Pittsburgh. Nelson
Walker showed me around the
city, and I made some friends,”
said Richards. “They made it seem

'1 like they really wanted me to

come here. The funny part is I
came to Pitt right before
Christmas, when everybody had
gone home. But I still enjoyed
myself.”

In an era where big-time sport

almost ,

paintbrush.

Richards has 2,929 career
rushing yards for Pitt, and with a
158-yard effort Saturday against
Louisville, he will move into 2nd
place on the Panthers all-time
rushing list behind Tony Dorsett.

Ironically, Richards met
Dorsett over the summer at the
opening of the Cost Sports Center,
where the two discussed how to
deal with reporters.

“He just told me that I should

try my best, that it’s a part of the

game,” said Richards.

Richards has many possible
individual records and goals in
reach but brushes them aside as
easy as he does a would-be
tackler.

“If you do that, you can
become selﬁsh. That’s not the
right attitude to play football. The
individual stuff will come,” said
Richards. “My mother always told
me to believe in my abilities. I just

want the best for my family, and,

football is a means to do that.”

consistently averaged almost 18
yards per catch. Despite such
numbers Schnellenberger is still
unimpressed with his offense,
citing turnovers, and
inconsistency as major areas of

concern.

The Cardinal offense has had
12 passes picked off and has lost
the ball 11 times on fumbles.
Louisville opponents have thrown
only nine INTs and lost the ball
only five times on fumbles.

“This football team has not
played outstanding all year. Our
defense is playing well, but we
haven’t been able to command
turnovers and in several games
we’ve allowed some big runs that
have taken away from our total
stats,” Schnellenberger said.

“Offensively, too many
turnovers, too much
inconsistency —— we haven’t

scored nearly what we should be
able to score. We think we can be
better than we’ve shown to date, ”

Paul Diamone Pitt News
Rod Woodson is almost as happy off the ﬁeld as he is while playing.

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Did you ever think you would
see the day when top professional
football players actually want to
sit on the bench more often?

Truly a bizarre concept. But
recently, two of the Steelers’ top
defenders have welcomed with
open arms the chance to ride the
pine.

In the first four games of the
season, the Steeler defense was
on the field for 130 minutes and
28 seconds. Translated, the
defense was shouldering the load,
staying on the field almost 55
percent of the time.

In the last two games, when
Pittsburgh ’s offense finally found
a way into the end zone with a
vengeance, the defense was only
on the field 41 percent of the
time.

For the past two weeks, Steeler
cornerbacks Rod Woodson and
David Johnson have had more
time to watch the game and
drink Gatorade; and they like it
that way.

“When the offense gets going,
it makes you feel better mentally
and physically because you know
you’re going to be on the field
less, and you’re not going to be
as tired,” Johnson said.

“Once the offense can keep us
off the field, the best defense is
on the sidelines. [The offense
has] been going out and playing

the way it should recently. This
will definitely give the offense
and the team a lot of confidence,
and we can start winning a lot of
games,” Woodson added.

During the first four weeks of
the season, the Steeler offense
was running three plays and
punting more often than
Congressional leaders were
writing up new proposals to solve
the budget deficit. In fact,
Pittsburgh defenders were rarely
seen sitting on the sidelines or
even standing with their helmets
off. All they did was wait for the
offense to go nowhere in three
downs.

Physical exhaustion certainly
plays a role with defenders being
on the field so often, but seeing
the offense fail also takes a mental
toll. I
“When you know the offense
is going to run three plays and go
out, you know you ’re barely going
to sit on the sideline and rest. It
takes away from your fire. And
when the offense is doing well
and moving the ball and staying
on the field, it makes you play a
whole lot better,” Johnson said.

“People were tired physically,
of course, and it took its mental
toll doing that week after week.
Offensive fire power pumps up
the team and the crowd, and it
quiets the crowd when we play
away, and that's a big help also,”
Woodson said.

Two top Steeler defenders hoping to ride

the pine

also adds to his physical and
emotional fatigue. Not only does
the second—year man out of the
University of Kentucky have to
chase receivers and tackle ball
carriers, but he must fulfill his
role on kickoffs and punts.

“I’m on every special team
except [for] ﬁeld goals. When
you get some rest, it comes in
handy because I play defense,
then I’m out on the field for
punts. Then the offense runs three
plays and goes out, and I’m back
on punts and defense again. It
wears on you,” he said.

Woodson is more concerned

with the emotional strain of being .

out on the field. One of the
Steelers’ quickest athletes,
Woodson seemingly never gets
tired. He can always be seen
breaking tackles on a punt or
kickoff return or bursting out of
nowhere to bring down a runner.
But for you psychology buffs,
Woodson may suffer from a bit of
“cognitive dissonance.”

“It’s more mental. If the offense
doesn’t score, it can drain you.
Once they start scoring,
everything picks up on both sides
of the ball,” he said.

And things have certainly
picked up on the offense in the
past weeks. But here’s to hoping
it doesn’t follow in its defensive

cou nterparts’ footsteps and begin '

to enjoy watching the game from
the sidelines.

The best offense is certainly
not one on the bench. ' ,

But whether it is on or off the
field, the Steeler defense is doing
all right. It is currently ranked first
in the AFC overall and second in
the NFL. Not bad for a couple of
guys who want to sit on the
bench more often.

Schnellenberger leads L-Ville rebirth

 

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

It’s right there, right on the cover — on the hard
cover, mind you — of the 1990 Louisville Cardinals
media guide.

“The Goal. ‘Our program is on a collision course
with the national championship. The only variable
is time.’ — Howard Schnellenberger.”

Why would a team with an all-time record of only
299-331-16 and which has not ﬁnished in the Top
20 in 20 years make such lofty predictions for the
future?

Schnellenberger. He’s done it before.

When he took over the head-coaching job at the
University of Miami in 1979, the Hurricane football
program was in dire straits. The team had not had
back-to—back winning seasons in 12 years, and
there was talk of discontinuing the program.

But a mere two years later Schnellenberger had
guided the ’Canes to a Peach Bowl victory and in
1983 to their first national championship.

In 1985 Schnellenberger went to Louisville under
much the same conditions, only this time he
promised a national championship for the Cardinals
right up front.

Cynics scoffed, and for a couple of years it
appeared they would be right. But this year
Schnellenberger is having the last laugh.—His 25th
-ranked Cardinals are 5-1-1, and the future looks
brighter than the fire stoking inside his now-
famous pipe.

“We came here in 1985, and we came for a very
specific reason,” said Schnellenberger. “When the
opportunity came to come back to my hometown
of Louisville, Ky., we were assured by the
administration and by everybody involved that
they wanted to play football at the highest level.”

The Cardinals are off to their best start since 1972,
and with a win this Saturday Schnellenberger
would tie Lee Corso, now an ESPN analyst, for
second place on the school’s all-time victories list.

MV ‘45 OR MORE
PIIIIOHASEOF

And he doesn’t give a damn. This year’s team will
be one of the best in the school’s history, but the
way he talks, you'd think they were 1-5-1‘.

“We have not played outstanding all year. Our
defense is listed in the top of a lot of categories, but
we haven't been able to command the turnovers
that we are capable of doing. In several of the
games we’ve given up the big run, which has taken
away from our total stats,” said Schnellenberger.
“Offensively we’ve had a lot of turnovers and too
much inconsistency, and we haven’t scored nearly
what we should be able to score.”

Under Schnellenberger the Louisville program
has grown dramatically, off the field as well as on.

Last week's game against Memphis State drew
the third-largest crowd in school history, six of
Louisville’s top 10 home crowds have come in the
past two seasons, and three of the school’s four
home games this year have been above the seating
capacity of 35,500. .

“A lot of people in this town have spent a lot of
time, effort and emphasis in helping us develop this
football team,” said Schnellenberger. “Those things
have been starting to come together.”

Attendance at Cardinal home games has grown
from an average of 24,100 the year before he came,
to a high of 37,5_11 last year.

“For three years we were pointing to the future,
but we had to go through those years 2-9, 3-8 and
3-7-1. In the fourth year, 1988, we made some big
plays, went 8-3. Last year we didn’t make the big
plays and fell back to 6-5.” said Schnellenberger.
“We're not national-championship caliber yet, but
obviously we’ve made a lot of improvements, and
we're making our way up that ladder.”

For four years Schnellenberger has been plotting
his return, while slowly but surely rebuilding a
program from the ashes, and although Louisville
won’t win the national championship this year,
don’t be surprised to see a lit pipe burning on the
sidelines in a major bowl in the near future.

Schnellenberger will make sure of it.

Lady Panthers fall
to Duke Blue Devils

By Ryan Buncher
Suﬁ Writer

“I think we took them too
easy,” said Coach Sue Woodstra
of the Pitt volleyball team’s loss
to Duke last night. “We’ve
beaten them twice already this
year. We felt like all we had to
do was show up.” I

The Lady Panthers record
dropped to 17-4 (4-0 in the Big
East) by losing consecutive
matches for the first time this

‘season. They dominated the

Blue Devils in the first game,
winning 15-3, but never got it
together after that.

“We were really hesitant,"
said junior Linda Zols. “We
weren’t all playing at the same
time. Everyone wasn't into it at
the same time.”

Duke won the second game,
15-8. Pitt took the third game,
15-12 before Duke stretched
the match to four games by
winning the fourth game 15-
13.

By the fifth game, Duke was
believing it could win. .

“Duke played well. We gave
them plenty of chances,” said
Woodstra. “In the first two
matches, when we shut them
down and they had the feeling
they couldn’t win, they played
horrible."

Duke rolled to a 13-7 lead in
the deciding game, and then in

Woodstra’s words, “All of a-

sudden it got close and
everybody started thinking we
might lose this so everybody
started picking it up."

The Lady Panthers got within
three before the Blue Devils
put the game away.

“It’s unfortunate because
we’ve had so few matches like
that this year. " Woodstra added,
“When we’re playing teams
that we’ve beaten before, or
that we may think are not as
good as we are, we have to
keep our game up, and we just
didn’t do that. I think that part
of it is that we played them
twice this year. We felt like we
knew what their capabilities
were. It’s a tendency to take
things too easy.”

The team had breakdowns
in the passing game. They, had
problems returning the hard
shots of a large Duke team,
especially the 6—foot—2- inch
sophomore middle blocker,
Amy Verhoven (23 kills and a
.404 hitting percentage), 6—foot-
2-inch freshman middle
blocker/outside hitter jenny
Rohrig (nine kills and a .400
hitting percentage), and 5-foot-
11'-inch senior outside hitter
Tracie Hopkins (17 kills).
