Surprise food survey

 

by SUE HOENSTINE

_ A dinner of liver and onions has sparked dis-
satisfaction not only among campus gastronomes,
' but also among Szabo Food Service employees.

V. '_In a recent_ edition. of the Pitt, News, the Food
 Service blamed the delayed serving of dinner Jan.
» '24 on the high absenteeism among Szabo employees.

, ;Do_ug Lane, Union representa_tive for Szabo
_*‘wo,rkers_, claimed “there was nobody sick in the
-{kitchen that night” and charged Szabo with mis-
 management. ' ‘

   
 

   
 

   

V ingithe work get blamed for what the management
». does,” Lane said. .

. - .- A Szabo cook who wished to remain anonymous
' -"said, *-‘They only ordered 100 pounds of liver, enough
‘. for about 400 servings. When there are 2,000 to 2,-
 400 people eating they "should have planned for at
4 least 1,000 servings.

, “We just weren’t expecting this,T’ said Assis-
, tant Food: Director Bert Provoznik. He attributed
‘rtheijdinner holdup to an unexpected popularity of liv-
— er among boarding students, absenteeism among
,- gernployees, and an anticipated-increase in students
_eating before 6 p.m. ’ - - ~

“We had prepared the normal amount of liver
. _and thenwe had a tremendousrinflux of people who
found the liver acceptable. When the liver ran out
people took the other item and put a burden on the
preparation of it,” Provoznik said.

y “Had the flow of people been consistent we
_ might have done okay with the people we had work-
.ing,”Vhe noted.
Provoznik did not specify how many Szabo em-
ployees were on duty at the time.

   
  
 
 

 

 

_ _ Szabo employees have also expressed dissatis-
faction with the quality of food purchased.

“The bacon that comes in is 90 per cent fat,”-

U ‘ — said Lane, who works as a receiver for Szabo. '

_ . “Cartons of breaded ‘fish which specify ‘must

by GLENDA MINSHULL

A number of complaints, includ-
ing a wire clip found in a meat
loaf, have surfaced from the
Women’s Housing .Board’s sur-
prise survey Wednesday night of
diners in the Towers Cafeteria.

The extensive survey asked din-
ers to comment on the meal serv-
ed that evening and on Szabo Food.
Service in general. Although many
students reacted favorably to the
roast pork and meat loaf served,
they offered a variety of criti-
cisms on the food service. ,

Many of those conducting the

survey speculated that the food
service had previously found out

what I cook, and then with a great deal of reserve,” .

Flexible options sought

iMarLdatory food plan probed.

by GLENDA MINSHULL

Although some type of mandatory board
policy" will be included in next year’s hous-
ing contract, a more flexible board plan is a
future possibility, according to John Vrana,
director of Housing. A 7

Vrana pointed out that the student'board—
ing committee is currently evaluating the
food service operation, and his office cannot
‘negotiate changes -in the boarding plan un-
less next yea_r’s operator agrees to provide
f'or the changes.

However, students in the School of Health.
Related Professions and the student, teach-
ing programscurrently have the option to
purchase a G-series meal ticket for the.Fall
and Winter Terms. The G-ticket, av16 meal
plan, does not include lunch on weekdays.

Vrana outlined" three limitations which
make an optional board plan unfeasible:

1) Lack. of facilities in_ the dorm for students
opting to cook for themselves. ‘

2) ‘Debit reduction on cafeteria equipment,
which must be paid whether students»util-
ize the University food service or not.

3) "Increased student costs, since without an H

accurate estimate of those eating in the
cafeteria. the Universitv in conjunction

with the food service must increase costs
to students to allow for fluctuation.

Judy McLaughlin, president of Women’s

Housing Board, sympathized with Vrana’s
dilemma. I ‘

“I think it would be fantastic, if a change

‘in the board plan was financially feasible,”

she said. - ,~ _ . .
I.McLaughl,in is also in favor of a lunch and
dinner only plan for apartment and frater-

. nity house residents. She pointed out that

many of these students purchase meal tick-
ets from dorm students at reduced rates

and that the dorm studentwas losing money ,

in the long run.

On thepositive aspect, Vrana said, “l?or
the first time in three years we haven’t an-
nounced an increase in rates, while other
area colleges have announced $800 room
and board rates for next year."

about the survey and had taken H

extra care to serve an appetizing
and hot meal that evening.

David Rothwell, director of
Szabo operations, told the Pitt
News Wednesday afternoon that
although many groups were con-
ducting surveys, his company
would be polling students. How-
ever, he didnot identify Women’s
Housing Board (WHB) as one of
the groups questioning students.

Judy McLaughlin, president of

WHB, wasn’t disappointed that
the survey may have been “leak-
ed.”

“If our having conducted a sur-
vey to improve the food service
gets results, then that's just
great,”she said. ’ - '

WHB plans future surveys dur-
ing breakfast, lunch and supper,
but these will only be spot surveys
and not as extensive as the one
conducted Wednesday.

Members of WHB are currently
tabulating the comments and will
release the results later this
week. Their initial findings have

I shown that students respond quite

seriouslyand point ‘out a varie-
ty of problems, ranging from the
attitude of Szabo employees to a
wire clip, which a student fished
out of his meat loaf while a WHB

\. surveyor witnessed the incident.

Another student, who speaks
only Portuguese, -eagerly respon-
ed to the survey in her native ton-
gue after she was assured that
someone would be found to trans-
late her comments.

The results of the survey will
be forwarded to food service man-
agement so‘that they will know
specifically what students are
complaining about. ' .

In an effort to familiarize stu-
dents with the new Student Gov-
ernment, the Pitt News has fea-
tured interviews with new SG
officials. In today's articles,
Board members Robert Stack and
Ken Krenicky share their views
on Student Government. '

Robert Stack, Student Gov-
ernment Board member, said of
room 305, Student Union, "’It’s
really confusing up there now."

The room is the SG office. The
activity is the organization of

Student Government according.

to the new Constitution.

According to Stack, "The way
the new Constitution is set up,

_. it can be very effective. It has

a good set of checks and bal-
.ances—~how can seven people
ever be in total agreement’ 0

. anything?” V
However, Stack said, i_n order .

for it to work, “we have to build
up a solid organizational. base,

not only for the present Student.

Government,. but for those. of
the future.” If this is not -done,
he continued, this Constitution
could prove to be asdisastrous

- as the last.

Presently the Board is concern-
ing itself with» making appoint-
ments and setting up committees.
In addition, by-laws must be
written to clarify “[a lot of gray

-areas in the new Constitution,”

stated Stack. V . ,

Stack. could not ‘predict in
which area he will specialize.

“It ‘depends on where we find
ourselves going. When we. find
out our weak areas, where we’re
falling out, we can deal with
those areas,” he said.’

Stack stated that. he would
rather work in this fashion, than
make promises, ‘carry them
out, and find that the decision
reached was the wrong one.

In reply to the accusation that
SG will bea fraternity-oriented
organization, Stack declared that

Nyro reiuvenates oldies in
 soulful shades of funk and blues bl95$g‘3lﬂ¢l( Messiah’

by WILLIAM M. SMITH

There‘s been a tremendous resurrection of in-
terest in the "oldies" department during the past
year or so. Rock and Roll Revivals have been suc-
cessfully touring the country. and nouveau. satir-
ical oldies bands with such esoteric names as Sha
Na Na and Daddy Cool have materialized.

A number of modern music groups, the Young-
bloods. Lee Michaels. Black Oak Arkansas. and
even the Grateful Dead. to mention a few." have seen
fit to include some updated versions of old hits in
their current repertoires.

What does all this talk of uncovering a past
“glory that was . . .” for a new generation have to
do with a young Jewish girl from the Bronx?

If her name happens to be Laura Nyro, it means
that now is the time to put out a new album consist-
ing of 11 samples of a bygone era.

The album is entitled, Gonna Take a Miracle.

On it, Laura shows excellent judgment in
choosing those tunes which most accurately pro-
ject a variegated portrait of her formative years.

She pays homage to such groups as Martha
and the Vandellas by doing “Dancing in the
Streets,” “Jimmy Mack,” and “No Where ‘to Run,”
the Shirelles with “I Met Him on a Sunday” and
Nolan Strong and the Diablos’ legendary “Wind.”

The title song, “Gonna Take a Miracle,” was
originally done by the Royalettes. The Miracles’
"You Really Got a Hold on Me” is included along
with "The Bells” by the‘Originals, "Monkey Time"
Major Lance and the Ben E. King smash “Span-
ish Harlem." All in all. quite an assortment of all
time chart busters.

There’s not much one can say in regard to the
quality, construction, or presentation of these songs

,&.-for they are all firmly established in the Rhythm

and Blues Hall of Fame. With a few exceptions,
Laura has been fit to leave them virtually un-
changed, showing a loving respect for the original

forms which left such deep impressions upon her ,

sensitive soul.

To complement and reinforce her attempt, the
new queen chose three performers of comparative-
ly obscure] status from the royal family of old rock
and soul.

Formerly known as Patti La Belle and the Blue

Bellas they were moderately successful in the

late ’50s, early '60s with such tunes as "1 Sold
My Heart to the Junkman” and a version of “Over
the Rainbow.” Since then they have shortened
their name to “LaBelle” and have made a come-
back album of their own.

These old familiar lyrics and_ melodies are
now heard from the addition of a new dimension,
the voice of Laura ‘Nyro.

N-yro is one of the consummate artists of our

Q” time and may be considered the musical embodi-

Her vocals take the listener fora ride on a roll-

The tunes on this album are the ones that blar-
ed from jukeboxes and storefronts to merge with
the bustling, funky rhythm of the city. The heat was
the urban heartbeat and the young Bronx-born Jew-

proof that the Quintet was indeed playing seriously, since who. after all.
pays five bucks to hear some of the boys jam?

In The Black Messiah, Adderley has found a most exciting com-‘
bination of exploration anchored in more traditional rhythms. With
George Duke on the piano and bassist Walter Booker laying downthe
melodies, Adderley has room to discover the range of his alto and so-
prano Saxophones, coaxing reluctant, startling notes from them.

The double album draws on each memberof the Quintet (Adderley.
Booker, Duke,cornetist Nat Adderley, and drummer Roy McCurdy) for
numbers. Guest performers Airto Moreire (percussion). Alvin Battiste
(clarinet), Ernie Watts (tenor sax. flute). and Mike Deasy (guitar)
also contribute songs.

If one is hearing this record with an ear dulled
by a never-ending stream of flashy Hot Sheet al-
bums. waiting to be turned-on“ by speedy guitar
likcs, "imaginative" special effects, or any of the
other obvious ploys modern pop music makers util-
ize to gain recognition. then these arguments have
a valid basis. '

Adderley’s bluesy vocal rendition of Duke Ellingtons "Heritage." or
Moreira’s (untitled) eerie percussive jungle. but also demonstrates
how much the group depends on its leader.

“Little Benny Hen” and “Zanek,” performed for the most part
without Cannonball, are little more than ancient rock-fuzz-toned guitar,
monotonous drum, and not a shred of originality.

The two best cuts, "Dr. Honouris Cousa" and "The Black Mes-
siah," reflect Adderley's eager curiosity amid more traditional jazz
patterns. In the title song, the melody is simply stated and used as a
base for improvisation by all. To be sure. Adderley has not abandoned
free form ("Eye of the Cosmos" is absolute improvisation and a gas).
but he is at his best when his scalar escapades are complemented by re-
curring themes.

The real merit of this recording lies not in the
superficial listening effect one receives from these
tunes. Rather it comes out in the realization that
here at last that ever-widening, fanatically loyal
cult of Laura Nyro followers are being shown the
roots from which sprung the plaintive, poetic flow-
er of wistful longing for a return to a simpler day.
She is unearthing the seeds and telling us that the
best things of all grow.

Laura Nyro is a true child of the city grown into
apoetress, a mistress of mood. The songs of this
album come from the music box to which she listen-
ed and learned.

Perhaps the best‘ way to show the city) soul
which is Laura Nyro is through her own lyrics:

tains the unexpurgated between-song patter of Cannonball. About the
-only advantage the record-listener has over the audience-member is
that he needn’t put up with the banal chit-chat most performers use to
fill voids between songs. '

That advantage is erased when Adderley takes-a. precious two min-

It was a satisfying weekend all the wayyaround for the Pitt track-
sters with their outstanding performance in the Allegheny Mountain
Association Senior track meet and despite a less profitable showing
in the Cleveland Knights of Columbus Meet.

“I wasn‘t there to see, but looking at the results, the boys did a,

good job in the Allegheny meet,”
stated Pitt’s coach Jim Banner
who was in Cleveland last Satur-
day with the other competing
tracksters.

“I-was also very pleased with
our team’s performance in Cleve-
land. They’re young and it’ll take
time, but they’re running right
with the best of them. ‘The boys
are not giving away anything,

e they’re competing for the top

spots.” »

{In the Knights of Columbus
meet, Pitt’s best showing came
from Dorel Watley who came in

Iznightsbomb skaters;

 game ended by brawl

 

 7,i1972i 

The Pittsburgh Knights are considered to be one of the finest ama-
teur hockey teams in the tri—state area but last night's game with Pitt
at the Alpine Ice Chalet proved the rumors to be false.

Although the Knights bombed Pitt, 12-0, in an abreviated contest.
their style of play only showed the capacity crowd that their "fine ama-

teur team” is nothing more than

A a squad of assorted "cheap—shot

artists."

From the start of the first per-
iod to the 9:07 mark of the third

. period. when the contest turned

into a brawl and was stopped by
the officials. the Knights played
nothing but "dirty“ hockey.

Players’ elbows and knees had
been flying throughout the game
and the Pitt skaters were taking
a beating on the scoreboard and
in the rink. Finally, tempers boil-
ed over with five and one half min-

_ utes in the game.

Ron Rizzo, part of the noted
brother act that the Knights

 boast, had checked winger Denny

Browne and had thrown a few el-

bows which the officials didn't see.’

The puck had slid behind the

‘ Knight’s goal and Rizzo went back

to retrieve it. Browne then hit

Rizzo with a hard but legal check-

and Rizzo retaliated with a flurry
of punches and elbows. I

‘ Both skaters dropped
sticks and gloves and the fight
started. The officials moved in to
pull the two apart but more push-
ing and shoving led to another
fight to the left of the net.

their‘ *-

The ref finally skated Rizzo to
the penalty box but he pushed the
official aside and skated back to
Browne. The linesman had a
‘.'bear bug" on Browne but Rizzo
jumped over him to throw more

punches at him. In the meantime .

both benches had emptied onto
the ice and several skaters were
pushing and shoving.

_At one point Rizzo even threat-
ened the linesman and grabbed
him by the jersey. Ken Metz.
Pitt’s player—coach, who had skat-
ed out to take his team off the
ice. was attacked by another
Knight. Order was restored and
the game was wisely terminated
by the officials.

The weekend turned out to be a

total disaster as Pitt also lost to_

the Penn State main campus
sq'uad,f5-4‘, at University Park in
another exhibition game.

Pitt will resume league action
tomorrow night at the Alpine Ice
Chalet as it will battle St. Fran-
cis College. Buses will leave at 8
p.m. from the Fifth Ave. side of
the Student Union. The game will
also be broadcast by WPGH.

Five-ten Ann Mathews of Kent
State scored 29 points. including
15 in the fourth quarter, as the
Panther women’s basketball team
suffered a 59-44 defeat on Satur-
day afternoon at Trees Gym to
KSU. High scorers for Pitt were
Mary Ellen Klobchar with 16 and
Rose Smith with 10.

Kent State tried to run the cag-
ers early in the game. but was un-
successful. The score stayed close
through the first quarter, but the
Golden Flashes poured in 11
points in a row in the second quar-

ter, and enjoyed a six point half---

time lead.

The second half followed the
same format. Pitt kept within
four through most of the third
quarter, holding Mathews to four
points. It appeared that the cagers
could pull it out.

Pitt stayed right in the game
until the last few minutes but Mat-
hews got hot again. Kent State fin

ished with its biggest lead of the

contest, 15 points, as they ac-
counted for the final 10 points.

Pitt coach Sandra Bullman,
while admitting that Kent State's
height advantage decided the
game, was not pleased with the
women’s play. She felt that the

team was not moving enough. and
not cutting towards the basket.

Kent State coach Paula Fly felt
that her team had made many
mistakes, and was very happy to
win the game. While not criticiz-
ing the fairness of the officials
she “thought that the game was
too physical and that more fouls

Kent State giant dumps
I’itt women hoopsters

should have been called."

The game was the second one
of the season for the Golden
Flashes. With the win, KSU even-
ed their record at 1-1. The Pitt
women will put their 1-2 record
on the line Wednesday night at
Carnegie—Mellon University.

Hawks, WPGH frustrated  
by double overtime standoff

In an unprecidented demonstra-
tion of gut determination and bas-
ketball prowess the Pitt News‘
Hawks and the WPGH Killercy-
cles battled to a 28-28 stand-off
in double—overtime only to relin-
guish the court to two other
teams yesterday afternoon at
Trees Hall.

The game ‘shaped up as a battle
of the big men with Zelmo Hell-
man and Rick “Hulk” Rosenthal
leading the Hawks against the
KC’s secret weapon, Steve Nuss—
baum.

When asked about’Nussbaum
(14 points) after the game,
_WPGH’s

Sports Director ' Ed

"Hairy” Rose indicated,  keep
him chained to the bed at night.”

Regulation time saw the
score knotted at 25-25.

Two three minute overtimes
didn’t help, with the first ending
deadlocked at 26-26 and the sec-
ond and final OT score sitting at

28-28.

Hulk Rosenthal canned a buck-
et after the whistle about which
he contended that he "was rob-
bed.” But the appeal was to no
avail and the two teams will have
to do it all over again in the near
future. "
