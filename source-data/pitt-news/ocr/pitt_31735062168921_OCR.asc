BY BILL YETTO

Even before George Wallace walked_ to the Civic Arena stage
Wednesday night, it was very apparent that anti-Wallace demonstra-
tors and pro-Wallace supporters would clashbefore the night was

OV€l'.

As thousands of Wallace supporters waited impatiently for himto
ascend the platform and speak, between two and three hundred demon-
strators, mostly university students filed into the upper section of the

arena .

While the Wallace people were
hooting, cheering, and singing
such songs as the “Star Spangled
Banner” and “God Bless America”,
students carrying signs sprinkled
themselves throughout the crowd.

The signs were directed at Wal-
lace. They carried slogans such
as “Fascists of the World Unite”
and “We said ‘Black and White
Power in 1860, You Racist”, while
others had Nazi salutes and swak-
tikas on them.

- When Wallace made his appear-
ance the confrontation began. As
he walked up to the microphone
the students ‘booed him and then

started a chant of “We Want
Peace”.
Wallace immediately pointed

a finger at the demonstrators and
shouted. “There are the anarch-
ists. There are the people that
this country is sick of .”

At this statement the Wallace
supporters went wild. . They
jumped up, shouted, screamed,
and shook their fists and thumb-
ed their noses at the dissenters
in the upper sections. A group
of Wallace youths began shout-
ing “Go home you bums’-’, “Get
out of here you rotten scum”,
and “Go home you Goddam
bums.”

Warriors Win?

This shouting match between Wallace,
his supporters, and the student demon-
strators continued throughout his half-
hour speech, ten minutes of which was
devoted to policy. Twenty minutes of the
speech was devoted to arousing his sup-
porters by calling the dissenting students
“anarchists and communists.

As Wallace began talking about Viet-
nam, the dissident students began again
to shout. “We"'want peace. We want peace."

‘To this "Wallace shouted, “What do you ‘

know about foreign policy. You don’t even
know enough to take a bath.” Wallace’s
supporters howled with pleasure at this
remark as he went on, “I’d like to see one
of you anarchists lay down in front of my
car while I'm in Pittsburgh. I swear it
will be the last time you ever do that.”
Then as the students began to shout even
louder, Wallace addressed them. He
shouted “We once ridded this country of

This excited the Wallace camp even
more, especially the group of youthful
Wallace supporters who did not confine
their often times obscene remarks to the
demonstrators. These were also directed
to the Pitt News reporters , other news
media. and to anyone who did not support
Wallace.

As the tension mounted Wallace/‘s speech
soon turned the Civic Arena into a con-
fusing melee of howling and foot stamping.
»-Ternpers mounted but the police kept the
situation in hand except for one serious
incident.

And that was-a fight which broke out 1 ;

between one black teenager and a group
of five young Wallace supporters.

The atmosphere of the fight ironically
contrasted Wallace as he asserted that he
was not a racist, even while some of his
young followers were shouting “White
Power”, and “You’ll wish you were white.”

all the Communists.”

F Wallace» ‘If I
Were President’

In his campaign speech at the
Civic Arena, Wednesday, Goerge
Wallace advocated three major
policies: Law and Order, Vietnam,
and Taxes.

ON LAW AND ORDER, Wal-
lace said that both major poli-
tical parties were responsible
A for lawlessness in the streets. He
also said that recent Supreme
Court decisions were hampering
the law enforcement agencies.

“It is not the people of this
country who are sick. but rather
it is the Supreme Court who is
sick”. he said. If I am elected
President I will revoke the re-
cent Supreme Court decisions on
law enforcement and show the
police of this country that I stand
behind them. 

“The Republicans and Demo-
crats had better say that they will
restore law and order, for they
are the ones that took it from us."

ON VIETNAM, Wallace
stated that he felt the Unit.ed
States should not be involved
alone in the war, and that he
would end it by all out military
victory. using conventional
means.

‘ they’re spending.”

“If our West European allies,
whom we helped in two world
wars, will not fight with us in
Vietnam then I am in favor of
cutting off all the foreign aid that
we now give them,” he added.

- “Why should we care what those

countries think of us. They should
worry about what we think of
them. After all it’s our money
“When I'm
elected President I'm going to
order the Joint Chiefs of Staff to
press for a quick military victory
in Vietnam," he said.

ON TAXES, Wallace felt
that the middle class was paying
too much of a share to support
the government, and that he
would end the tax exemptions
given to large foundations. “I
cannot see why the city of Pitts-
burgh. on the advice of multi-
billion dollar‘ foundations. should
raise its taxes in order to protect
themselves from violence and.
disorders, while these very foun-
dations are tax exempt," said
Wallace.

"If I am elected I will end. all
tax exemptions for all multi-
billion dollar foundations.

   Superficiality

Welcome parents. Once again, you will be looking with

 . awe at the Cathedral of Learning. Once again, you will visit

=Clapp Hall, the Dormitories, the Fine Arts Building, and the
Bookcenter. Once again, you will meet the Chancellor and be
a spectator at a footballgame. And once again, you will get
a superficial glimpse of college life.

' College life isn’t a bowl of roses; it isn’t fraternity party
after fraternity party’; it isn’t football game after football
game. The time a student spends at college is a period of
drastic change—a time for a man or a woman to learn how to
stand up for that which they believe. It is a time of profound

 skepticism. We learn to question the meaning of life, liberty,

and the pursuit of happiness; we learn to question the social
‘mores of American Society. And we even learn to question

 the very existence of God.

All the students at this University have learned a great
deal from you, our parents. You have taught us to have faith-
faith in God, democracy and the American way. You have
‘instilled in us a sense‘ of morality——a sense of duty. And you
have taught us that all men are brothers.

We have learned many things, but when we look out

a into the cold cruel world we wonder—we wonder if there is
a ‘God who benevolently looks after all his children. If God

.  mis alive, why are their wars, and why do men hate each
, other, and why are their murders and rapes, and why do men

like George Wallace have diseased minds.? Why? There is
no answer. - ‘

Many students don’t have a strong faith in God, and
many student s have lost their faith in our democratic system.
We believe in the precepts of democracy, but we rebel
against the system. Can we really believe in democracy and
free will when we are waging an unjust and illegal war in

l‘ I . Vietnam. How can a democratic nation, in the name of free-

dom, the American way, and motherhood and apple pie, con-
done‘ the killing of people and burning of villages in Viet-

A O nam.

In this democracy of ours students scream obscenities at_

A". police, and ‘police club students. In Miami, the security pre-

cautions were extensive. At Chicago, under the benign male-
volece of “King Richard”, the security network was along
the lines of a police state. Can Gestopo tactics be tolerated
in our democracy?

The political campaign‘ trail was long and lonely. Nel-
son Rockefeller was in the wrong political party, and Eugene
McCa_rthy was an iconoclast who wasn’t accepted by the
Democratic faithful. And Robert F. Kennedy fell victim to
the politics of assassination.

In grade school, we were instilled with the long great
history of the United States. We learned about America the
land of equality—-theland of freedom and opportunity. But
now we rebel. ‘ -

Parents, we rebel against your teachings not because we

. have a profound disrespect for you, not because we dislike

you, but because we have seen the mind-blowing hypocracy
- in this society. Its very nice to believe in God, America, and
Morality, but these sound values have been warped and un-
raveled by the citizenry-the ideal American.

, Some students grow long hair, some students smoke pot.
Others join radical movements.‘ And all of this is precipi-
tated by our fervent desire to cure the ills of this society. But
we are frustrated, for we perpetually run into a brick wall—
the “establishment”.

But the fight for justice, freedom, and equality will,
nevertheless, continue. Students want to have a voice——a voice
for that which is good and just. Yes, this, too, is part of col-
' lege life.

Parents, you probably wonder “what’s happening” on
the college campus. You probably wonder why your sons
have grown beards, and your daughters want sexual freedom.

But don’t worry about it parents, for this “Weekend” is
an escape from reality—a time for fraternity parties, foot-
V ball games, and Chancellor’s receptions. All of us here at

I The Pitt News wish you a-fun filled weekend. And we

hope that when you wake up Monday morning, you will
have fond untroubled memories of the University of Pitts-

‘ter..

Tony The Hustler: Business
Is Off This Year . . . ‘Way Off’

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

Tony, the Italian kid from South
Oakland, is the top hustler at Pitt
football games. He hustles every-
thing, from “how about a flower
for your girl” to “pssst, hey mis-
. wanta a couple of 50 yard
seats‘?”

He works outside while th e
crowd is going through the gates.
and then, he works inside when
the crowd is at their seats. (Only
two people know how he gets in-
side the Stadium.

-BUT LAST year, the year be-
fore, the year before that, and of
couse this year, Tony is having a
rough time. When Pitt loses, “no
budy buy anthin’,” screams the
black-haired kid. For Tony, busi-
ness is really bad this year.

“I maka few bucks here and

Pitt pennants. and Pitt yellow
mums. “Thisa guy . . . whatisname
. . . Hart, whats ’e du ta me. I no
sellnuthin’.” _

Tony even makes a few coins
after the games. He goes around
and picks-up the programs tossed
aside by angry and frustrated fans.
Then he sells them for a dime or
15 cents after the crowd leaves the
stadium.

“DISA YEAR, everyone rips-
upa da programs,” he says. “Ev-
eryone, he’sa mad. Pitt lost last
week. OMIGOSH, I’m not goin’
to sell nuthin’ dis week. Whose
disa tem . . . Mary and Bill.”

During the week, and when Pitt
and the Steelers are away, Tony
runs a few numbers for Kelley
from Forbes Avenue. It’s an easy

job. All Tony has to do is go
around to the local businesses and
shops, take an occasional walk
down Atwood, Oakland, or Daw-
son. and make a pickup.

Tony never has any slips on him
though. He’s got a good memory.
“Dat’s easa job,” says Tony, who
came to the states four years ago
when he was 11.

“SOMATIMES,” says Tony,
“people who dun’ know. thing
numbers are bad. No. no, no. Der’s
an old, old lady on Atwood, and
ya know, the only hope she has ina
dis world is hitting on her nickel
-bet she puts a down on 228 every
day." ’

“It’sa only thin’ she cares about.
It’sa her only joy ina life. And ya
know, ” said Tony scratching his
eye, “she makesa me happy every-
time she smiles and she says, ‘To-
day isa my day.”’ .

Because of the exciting’ social,

few students are aware that three

allowed to interview these dis-
tinguished gentlemen.

What they said may interest
you, but then again, so may the
Boer war, if you know what I
mean.

I FIRST ASKED the candi-
dates what they thought of the
growing wave of student power
that seems to be sweeping the
nation. The first to reply, was
Richard Nixon.

He said, /“Well, as I’ve said in

' the past, there is no clear-cut

answer to this question. I mean,

students either have power, or

. they don’t or maybe they have a

little power, or whatever. I
stand on my record on this ques-
tion, and you all know what that
is, nevertheless, anyhow.”

“Ah think student powuh is
a fahn thing,” said George Wal-
lace. “In fact, ah think all stu-
dents should be given a physical
test to see if he or she or it has
enough physical powah ta com-
pete in intramural sports. We
don’t have no weakling students
pusafootin’ around where ah come
from, and there shouldn’t be none
no where no how.”

MR . HUMPHREY was the
last to reply. “As President John-
son once said”, he began, "‘it’s
a proud man that wears his col-
lege beanie! And I wouldrhave
to agree with him, becéfuse in

‘this country of happiness and

joy, I can see no better example
of happiness than a twenty year
old student running around ,with
a beanie on his head. Of course

I love student power, and I hope a

it loves me, because I need all
the support I can get.”

The Different Drummer

My Candidate Will Put ‘Ham’
In Every Pot In November

After these clear and" intelli-
gent answers I asked the candi-
dates for their impressions of
our university. “AH THINK it’s
a fahn school, a fahn school,”
said George Wallace. “But ah
don’t see why ya’ll need ta have
three of them twenty—story high
garbage cans. Wouldn’t one be
enough? By the way, how’s the
football team‘? 5’

I didn’t answer.

“I, too, agree that it is a fine
institution,” chimed in Richard
Nixon. “However, I fail to see
the necessity of those twenty
story swimming pools which Mr.
Wallace has erroneously called
“garbage cans”.

Finally Mr. Humphrey gave me
his impressions. “I also heartily
concur that this is a fine insti-
tution of higher learning. But
it necessarily has to he, doesn’t
it, .since the learning is on such
a high level—after all, the 36th
floor of the Cathedral is pretty
high, isn’t it?—ha ha—we1l, I
was just trying to spread a little
happiness and joy.”

Yep. I

 

 

 

By BRUCE LEVENSON

Presidential elections are
always very_ exciting. Every four

. years we democratically choose

the man who is best qualified to
handle the awesome duties of the
Presidency.

Once again this year, the pub-

-lic has exercised its opinion at

the ballot box. In the primary
elections we were able to select
our favorite candidates. Then the
Democratic and Repbulican con-
ventions nominated different
people.

IN NOVEMBER, a majority
of the voters may choose someone
only to find that he lacks a major-
ity of the electoral votes. Then,
the House of Representatives will
choose someone for us. I guess
that is what is meant by the term
“representative government.” . .

‘ V We have a great variety_ of ,g':an-_-

. baboon got _to,.4be_ where; he‘, is to-'

 

didates and political philosophy.
Too bad none of these candidates
are running for the White House.

TRICKY DICKY Nixon sure
fooled us all. We didn’t know that
we wanted him for President
until the Republican convention
told us so. His policies represent
the people. He advocates more
money for the space race and
Vietnam and less for the poverty

program.-With only 2 per cent A

of its delegation Black, nothing
less could be expected of the
party that represents change in
our land.

Georgie “Law and Order’_’ Wal-
lace is not prejudiced. He said so.
Politicians always tell it like it
is. A

-day by virtueof his intellect.

He has a clay mind. It can be
easily bended, twisted, formed,
and reformed. Right now it is de-
formed.

AFTER CAREFUL scrutini-
zation and analysis I have selec-
ted the candidate who best repre-
sents all areas of political thought.
That candidate is the Youth Inter-
national Party nominee-Pigasus.

Pigasus is a real live. pig which

kind of gives him a certain kind
of .charisma. Not only that but

‘ he doesn’t differ to much from the

other candidates‘. They’re just
different kinds of pigs. But, at
least Pigasus is honest enough not
to hide the fact that he is a pig.
We need an honest President and
Pigasus is our man.

With Pigasus in office, we
could be assured of another four
-years of a pig’ in the White,-House.

Some men thinkthe only
way to get a good, close shave
is with a blade.

If that's what you think,
we'd like to tell you something
aboutthe NorelcoTripleheader
Speedshaver®.

In a,very‘ independent
laboratory, we had some very
independent men shave one

  You can’t
et any closer.

side of their faces with a lead-
ing stainless steel blade, and
the other side with a new
Norelco Tripleheader.

The results showed the
Tripleheader shaved as close
or closer than the blade in 2
out of 3 shaves.

The Tripleheader has
three rotary blades inside new,
thin, Microgroovem heads that
‘float,’ so it follows your face,
to shave you closer.

The Tripleheader has a
pop—up sideburn trimmer. A
handy, coiled cord. And a '1 10/
220 voltage selector.

It comes in both a Cord
and a Rechargeable model.

And it won't pull or nick
or cut.

Because it shaves your
beard.

Not your face.

etc.) (which -“Law enforcement
—_officers get a discount on.) where
the police forces of this country
stand. But when we get to the
{university level we expect some-
-"thing different in the line of

“same swaggering armed to the
teeth confused and scared white
men that make of the beast force
"joff campus. And that makes the
university cop a minor version
-of the oppressive forces which
 ring the black community (so-
 ; called ghetto).
All policemen seem to view
their roles as protecting white
"society and property’ from the
'nigge_rs, a sort of occupation army.
‘University policemen must view
themselves as protecting the good
clean cut college kids from the
 contamination of the “Ghetto
element” in the same racist terms.
'University'cops have a job to do
 that requires dealing with a lot
 of asinine white-kid actions such
 A as dropping water out of the dorms
" -on the cops, dropping toilet paper
the same, heckling and jeering,
-and an occasional scuffle but to
"date no University cop has seen
fit to draw his weapon (which
every policeman is instructed not
to draw unless he intends to use
 it—'-which means the racist at
 Duquesne fully intended to use
 his.) on a white clean cut col-
j lege kid. “By god, they'd have
 his ass,” as they say in the higher
';echelons of white power. That
 ' would absolutely turn this univer-
, sity out. Cadillacs and Lincolns
 would" pull up to the dorm and
little white kids would be heaving
here for safer ground, and the ad-
V. ministration would be very
{' .- prompt in dismissing and for-
 ever labeling the indecent cul-
""jprit cop involved. In our case the
cop at Duquesne might get a
medal. He is being suspended for
‘thirty days and his weapon lif-
.ted afterwhich time, he will re-
turn to Duquesne in a different
"capacity. Probably as chief of
' campus cops with a new weapon
.- I that’s easier to fire—maybe a sub-
.:j.7,machine gun like the cops in
' St. Louis use on Blacks.
 ' We must have means of pre-
 cluding the hiring and arming

  
 
  
  
  
   
 

    
  
 

  
   
  

of racist policemen on univer- '

sity campuses. The question as
 to why campus policemen must
 carry a 32 caliber six-shooter, a
I can of MACE and a billy club is

PR£'rz.£L;

police protection. But we get the ,

one that the university must an-
swer. Why are the police on this
campus armed? Are they expected
to react to the just struggles of
Black people on this campus in
the same manner as do the dull
minded racist at Duquesne. Are
their weapons merely to keep
the “Ghetto element” from South
Oakland and the Hill District off
of the campus. Are they protect-
ing miss college ann from rapists
who prowl the campus in-the dis-
quise of black college “boys”.
What do they have guns for? Why
is the police force increasing in
personnel and weaponry just
when Black people have said
that we will have an increase in
Black enrollment at this Univer-
sity. Why are the campus police
armed — so that the next colored
boy who refuses to show his i.d.
card when white students show
none can be made to know better;
will the police attack the next
gathering of Blacks or is the MACE
and the firepower to insure that
such gatherings do not take
place.— We want to know. Why
are the ill trained, scared, racist
structured, un-tested, campus
policemen armed? We know they
shouldn’t be.

].E.W.I.S.H. Progress Report:
‘Chutzpah Baby! Chutzpah I’

by DAVID ROSENBLUM

I have received many cards and
letters in the pass few weeks in-
quiring about the success of J .E.
W.I.S.H. (the Joining of Every
Westernized Intellectually Stim-
ulated Hebrew), and I thought
that it would only be fair to de-
vote this entire‘ column to a prog-
ress report on this new and es-
sential student organization.

If I had to make a flat state-
ment, I’d have to say that things
are going very well. However,
we did run into a few minor 'dif-
ficulties that that I thought you
would be interested in hearing.

FIRST, THE school agreed to
change the mascot from a pan-
ther to a gefilte fish, but we were
unable to obtain any insurance
on it from a reputable company.
Even L1oydstein’s of London
said, “We’d have to be out of our
bloomin’ minds to cover any-
thing so vicious as’ a full grown
gefilte fish.” So we are going to
be forced to keep the gefilte
only when he’s a pup. This will

"necessitate a new fish every

year, but as Mussolini used to say,
“You can’t win ’em all.”

After the West Virginia _dis-
aster, Dave Hart had decided to
wear a yarmulke and play all
of his games on Sunday, Hart
said he could not understand his
two losses, but we warned him
that we’d be praying against
him._Everyone knows _we’ve got

God on our side, so Hart gave in to ’

us. He inquired about the possi-
bility of giving God a grant-in-
aid for next year, but we told him
that He had. already signed a
letter of intent with Notre Dame.
Oh, Hart did try to sign Saul “yid
kid” Stein, but he had just accept-
ed a rabbinical scholarship from
Bear Bryanberg f at Alabama.

AS USUAL, the Bookstore pre-

sented us with the greatest pro-
blem. They flatly refused to order

‘Q0000OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

the next day they went ahead and
ordered The Wit and Humor of
Joseph Goebbels, and Meter Read-
ers I Have Known by A. Hitler.
This was a bit much in our esti-
mation. In retalliation to this bal-
tant act, therefore, we all Stood
around in a circle, made a
‘wish, and before you could say
Tel Aviv,” the Bookstore had been
destroyed by lighting and the
owner turned into a pillar of salt.

The next day we cleared the
rubble and erected the Pitt Co-
op Bookstore, “The Kibbutz where
you can Kibbitz! I’m happy to
report that business is booming.

Now comes the really good news:

the administration has given in to
every one of our academic de-
mands. If you’ll take a quick look
inside the Commons Room you’ll
see a throne being built for David
Kurtzman so that he’ll finally
achieve his highest glory.

Jack Critchfield has agreed to
increase the Jewish popula-
tion every June sixth: for this
magnanamous gesture, we are
going to make him “Cantor for
A Trimester.”

As of last week, the Jewish cul-

ture courses are now in operation.
Students can now take courses
like Jew 132, The History of the
Bronx Jew From Partchester to
Dewitt C. High School.‘A word

of caution however, the course is .

being taught by that noted Bronx
expert Dr. Howard Levine. so be
certain to register early.

AS FAR AS having segregat-
ed English classes, J.E.W.I.
S.H. has decided against it. We
felt that we would be doing a great
disservice to all the students from
the small coal towns‘ who think
that “Lox and Bagels” is a skin
condition. It is now our stated
aim to have a completely mixed
student body, so that we will be
able to understand each other in
a different light.

As Roger Fedargo, head of the
Southern Baptist Group, said, “I
hope that some day, there will be a
Jew in every pew.” Kudos to you
Roger.

Well, that’s about all I have to
report on our old demands. We
’re still not sure if we’ll have the
menorah on the Cathedral at
Chanukah time, but we’re work-
ing on it.

Republican Algia Gary runs for congress against Democrat William S.
Moorehead.

‘Playtex is the trademark of Inlerrmlianal Playtex Corp., Dover, Del. @1968 International Playtex Corp.

Playtex* invents the ﬁrst-daytampon”

(We took the inside out
to show you how different it is.)

Outside: it’s softer and silky (not cardboardy).
Inside: it’s so extra absorbent. . .it even protects on
your ﬁrst day. Your worst day!

In every lab test against the old cardboardy kind...
the Playtex tampon was always more absorbent.
Actually 45 % more absorbent on the average
than the leading regular tampon.

Because it’s different. Actually adjusts to you.

It ﬂowers out. Flufts out. Designed to protect every

is almost zero! g ', ' .

Algia Gary is a Republican Negro running for Congress against the incumbent Democra 
William S. Moorehead. He freely discussed’ his postions on many issues, both local and-nation

y Discusses Local, iNational Issues

by JUDITH GALARDI

al, at an interview with the Pitt News recently.

Gary had much to say about the students here at the University. “I have great respect ,_
for today’s student, for both his intellect and ability. Students must be given more considerag '

ation, and they should have a voice

in the planning of the govern-

ment within the University.”

He continued to say that ‘stu-
dents today will be our future
senators, congressmen and cor-
poration presidents. I need active
support of students to let people
know what the congressman hasn’t
been doing. Our representa-
tive«isn’t doing anything about
the issues discussed, and I think
it is imperative for him to be a re-
presentative for the people.”

Concerning the‘ draft, _Gary
said, “New ideas must be for-
warded and added upon the anti-
quated draft system. I feel that
it is unfair to force young men in-
to the service when they really
don't want to go, expecially when
these young men are preparing
themselves for their futures. No
young man in this country would-
be against taking his chance in a
National Lottery.” V

Moorehead, Gary’s opponent,
stated that he wanted to see a li-
quidation of U.S. military involve-
ment in Vietnam. but that this li-
quidation was to be made through
a decision of the military, Gary
insists that, “We cannot’ allow
such a delicate‘ consideration, one
with such far-reaching consequen-
ces, to'be placed exclusively in
the hands of the military, wheth-
er in the field or the Pentagon.
This war is vastly different from
the World Ward, when America
itself was at stake. Young intel-
lectuals are being needlessly ex-
pended in an unpopular war.”.

7 Gary has a four phase program,
A Blueprint for Peace. He called
for: ' ‘ ’

I. A cessation of ‘the United

States’ bombing of North Viet— '

nam as a means of precitpitating
a general cease—fire throughout
the theatre of conflict.

‘ II. The introduction of an in-

ternal peace-keeping force into
the area’ and a concentration of

American. troop strength in the
centers of population along the
coast of South Vietnam, culmina-
ting in a gradual withdrawal of
American forces to U.S. milit-
ary bases in the Pacific.

III. The holding of free elec-
tions in Vietnam as called for by
the Geneva Accord of 1954 which
would be supervised by an interna-
tional inspection team.

IV. A removal of all foreign
troops from Vietnam once the peo-
ple of Vietnam had determined
-their own future through the pro-
cess of free election.

, second floor at first. A cop who had been
‘wat the station when we arrived escorted me
there; I presume he was the jailor. As I
Walked into the cell he kicked me from be-
hind'and said something like: “If you
n’t keep your mouth shut, I’ll come in
ere and really take care of you.” After
awhile he came back and took me to an-
other “bullpen” on the first floor. Soon
Ron" (the other person detained), and the
physics teacher, Isaac, came in.

,_I I told Isaac that I was a mathematics
 student and he said that a group of mathe-
maticians had marched on the Amphithe-
ater to protest the war earlier in the day.
When I referred to the cops as pigs, he in-
, terruped and said that we shouldn’t call
 them pigs, that they deserved our compas-
sion since they were exploited by the sys-
" tem just like everybody else. .

, A little later I saw two cops dragging
f.,a“ babbling handcuffed figure across the
 floor. I couldn’t make him out very well
” without my glasses and feared he was a
, demonstrator beaten senseless by the cops.
:f~I- asked Isaac if he was “one of us.” He
jg. answered immediately.

“HE’S ONE ‘of us, one way or the
_ otherf’ Every time Daley inflicts his
gjstories of “militant, hard-core anarchists”
' on. me, I conjure up the image of this gen-
 ft-lehumane man.

6 All this time people had been flowing
nto the cell in a continuour stream. A
, Yippie leader had come in when I was
 talking to Isaac, and I began listening to
*-jhim. He had been recognized by the cops,
Jxwho apparently arrested him for being a
 Yippie leader (he was trying to hide from
them when he was picked up). He was
»';-'.discuss'ing the cops’ loss of self-control and
attributed it to the disintegration of the
social order they represent, a social order
v_.-in'which_they dictated justice and the peo-
ifple. humbly accepted the crumbs they
_ were given. He said that no one locks their
~ doors in the apartment building he lives
 in because they think of themselves as a
 community and t;vlst.each other. If these
__ ideas-are subversive, I think they should
5.‘ "atleast be considered as realistic alterna-

Chicago resident and had been arrested,

as far I, could determine for being in‘pos- I

session of a camera (needless to say, riot-
ing cops regard people with cameras as
the enemy). His repeated applications
were ignored. Another of the people ask-
ed to make a call when we arrived at the
downtown station and was yelled into sub-
mission because he “asked the wrong per-
son.” By the time we got to Cook County
Jail it was too late, of course.

MY BOND was set at $500 at my hear-
ing Tuesday morning; this was twice the
minimum because of the “physical as-
pect.” Ten per cent of this amount had to
be paid to assure my appearance in court
the next" Tuesday. I was able. to speak
briefly to a public defender and gave him
my name and address. He notified my par-
ents of the situation, and they contacted
people in Chicago who were able to ob-
tain my release Wednesday afternoon. '

I then learned that I could’ve gotten
out earlier if the cops hadn’t pursued a
policy of non—cooperation and obstruction-

- ism. I set about obtaining the release of

five demonstrators who were still being
held on $25 bonds. Money I had ‘sent for
came around 7 p.m. and I finally got ,a
cab to take me to the Cook County Jail.
(Most of the cab drivers were out on strike
at this time.)

AT THE JAIL they told me that there
could be no releases without the appropri-
ate bond slips, which were on file at the
downtown station. So I went back down-
town. A group of cops was clustered
around the front door, presumably pro-
tecting the entrance from an invasion of
mad-dog anarchists like myself. Just as I
stepped from the cab one of them holler-
ed, “You’d better get right back in that
cab.” I was a little stunned and hesitated
for a second. Then I realized that I’d "bet-
ter do just that before I was attacked.

I went back to the “Y,” where I’d been‘

staying, and watched the roll call at the
Convention on TV. The set was in the so-
cial room, and the audience booed each
time the camera focused on Daley’s face.
The burlesque sense of contrast which I
presume was evident to the-whole nation
via televison was of. mind-blowing pro‘-
portions to those in Chicago. I had seen
some ofthe bloody victims of the police
rampage earlier that day, and the con-
trast to Daley’s game playing in the Am-
phitheater was truly surrealistic. After
Humphrey was nominated I went to Grant

‘ Park.

The National Guard had been called in
and was lined up across Michigan Ave-
nue separating the demonstrators from the
Conrad Hilton Hotel. I understand the of-
ficial rationale for this was that the cops
were tired and a new group was needed to
protect the Hilton from the demonstrators.
What they actually did, of course, was to
protect the people from the police. I’m not
trying to make a case for the Guard: some
of them were all right, some were bas-
tards; the point is that tthey were well
disciplined and weren’t prone to riot like
the police; There were some surrealistic

-scenes with Guardsmen . too.‘I witnessed
the discussion of one sergeant with ‘two

ONE _OF THE latter deplored the dem-
onstrators and said that it was “too bad
things like this have to happen.” The ser-
geant agreed sadly and said that the call-

up had ruined his plans for a golfing vaca— ‘

tion. I had to speak up to maintain my san-
ity and noted that the -Vietnamese prob-
ably feel a little uncomfortable too when
they get napalmed and machine-gunned.
I was answered by three dull stares.

I learned that Julian Bond, a member
of the loyalist Georgia delegation who at
one point wasltdenied his seat in the Geor-
gia legislature for anti—wa_r statements,
had toldthe demonstrators earlier that it
was a shame he had to cross a line of pigs
in order to get to see the people (this was
when the cops were still in front of the
Hilton). The proceedings at Grant Park

were quite democratic actually. There.

was a general uproar once when someone
tried to deny the microphone to a person
he disagreed with (can the same be said
about the “Democratic” Convention in
the Amphitheater)?

FRIDAY I WENT back to the 18th
District Police’Station to reclaim the arti-

cles taken from me upon arrest (among-

these were a shirt, my hotel key, an iden-
tification card, a peace symbol, a paper-
back book, and several newspapers and
magazines). I was informed that there was
“no record” that I had come in with any-
thing; apparently I was mistaken about
being in possession of these articles when
I was arrested. This was a very interesting
revelation to me.

At my trial Tuesday I waived, the right
toa jury trial and to "counsel. In retrospect

I’ma little surprised at. t,he_naivet’e I dis-. .
pla_yTed;- ‘I1 expected to .tell the.‘.truth. and

 
 

 

  

then obtain justice. The “arresting offl-
cer” spoke first. He said I was “yell1ng
and screaming,” but he couldn’t remem-
ber exactly what. He couldn’t know, of
course, since he wasn’t really the arrest-
ing officer (but I didn’t know this at the
time).

i -’ I RELATED the conditions of my ar-

rest and attempted to answer the charge
of using obscene language to a police of-
ficer with a threat to violence. I argued
that I said what I said in response to be-
ing pushed from behind and that I was
walking away from the cop whenl said
it; thus the phrase “with a threat to V10-
lence” wasn’t applicable.

The prosecutor, however, argued that I
was part of a group guilty of the offense‘.
.and was thus guilty of it myself. Accord-
ing to this logic, the facts I had offered
were a bit irrelevant. I was guilty and
that’s all there was to it.

So I call a cop a brave “M-Fer” when
he pushes me. I’m beaten. I see people
denied phone calls in jail. The cops ob-
struct attempts to get me out of jail on
bond and my own attempts to get others
out. I’m stolen from. I’m lied to and de-
nied justice. But anyone fearful of stri-
dent, militant young anarchists of my
stripe. needn’t be -discouraged at the tim-
idity of such measures, for there is more.
Enter, in the finest tradition of anti-sub-
version, the FBI. ‘

THE AGENT I spoke to was very pro-
fessional and really quite agreeable, a
wonderful contrast to the Chicago police;
he reminded me of Porfir_v Petrovitch in
Crime and Punishment. «

But the fact remains that I’m being in-
vestigated to determine if I’ve violated
the Federal Anti-Riot Law‘ of 1968 (I be-
lieve the penalty for violation is five years
_in jail and/or a $10,000‘ fine). What
would I think of going to jail, the agent
asked. This is a very sobering prospect.

If federal prisons operate like the army,
I’m sure I’d be denied assuming a social-
zly useful function like teaching mathe-
matics. These could be five rather dull
years. At least I wouldn’t have to suffer
double jeopardy: I’d be 26 when I got out
and beyond draft age.

Perhaps this threat from the FBI can
best be understood in the context develop-
ed in the following quote. It is drawn from.
the article Reflections on a Political Trial
by Noam Chomsky, Paul Lauter and Flor-
ence Howe in The New York Review of
Books (August 22, 1968): “It should be no
surprise that a government engaged in
agressive war should be impelled to at-
tack the civil liberties of its own citizens.
We emphasize again what appears to us to
be a central issue in this case (the Spock
trial): it is impossible to conduct a brutal
war of agression in the name of an en-

lightened and informed citizenry. What- ‘

ever happens in Vietnam, a national com-
mitment to a global repression carries
with it the necessity for drastic limita-
tions on the rights of American citizens as
well. The Boston trial is one further step

  very_naturaldevelopment.  —

  

 

  
  
   
  
 
   
  
 
  

SENATE RACE schwez1§2“zZ2¥"

    ~ TWO MEN WHO SEE 
   DIFFERENT THINGS  

The issues of the 1968 Presidential Election are firmly resounding in
the race for Senator from Pennsylvania between Republican Richard
Schweiker and the incumbent, Democrat Joseph S. Clark.

Both candidates expressed the view that we can't be the world's
policeman, but differed in their approach to the problem. Mr. Schweiker
asserted that, “our main problem in dealing with foreign affairs, is that
we drag our feet, and don’t let our positions become known.” Senator
Clark expressed the need" for a cut in the military budget and subse-
quent allocation of these funds into domestic programs.

They differ sharply in their view of the draft. Mr. Schweiker pro-
poses the establishment of a volunteer army. He also urged that they
be paid the minimum wage and those with special skills be given
higher rank than private upon enlistment. Senator Clark opposes this
plan becuase “it woul be a very expensive venture.” He suggested that
only those men between the ages of 18 and 19 be drafted to remove the

a man in a charcoal gray suit,

_ in Chicago, lustful cops. Twenty-

one newsmen had to find out the
hardest. way; and in the corner of
the main detention area of the
Cook County jail a willowy brun-
ette with some of the dust of Grant
Park on a gray sweat-shirt found
out as she was beaten by a
lustful Chicago cop. Middle-aged
well-meaning McCarthy wives
found out. Fifty-seven year old
cab driver Randolph d’Zurkio
—a commie—baiter but yippie-lover-
found out. Quiet, purposeful,
Southern-drawling Dan Rather
of CBS News found out. They
found out becasue they were beat-
en.

Ann Hayes was unoffical chief
of medical operations in Chicago
for the week of violence. She
said, “The number of people hurt
here is so imposing, the nature of
the injuries so monstrous, it’s real-
ly impossible to tell how many kids
were hurt. We didn’t even have
time to keep a logbook.”

Miss Hayes is on the Medical
Committee for Human Rights; one
of her associates had this to say:
“I spoke to a police desk sergeant
in one of the local precints. He
finally blew his stack at some of

- my questions; he said the order

had gone out to the hospitals not
to report any of the injuries to the
press or jiist about anyone.

But gathering together loose
strips of paper with hastily scraw-
led names and addresses the
two women managed to scrape
together some count of the num-
ber of people hurt during five

nights of violence. Their accounts .

were mostly from the makeshift

livingroom-size hospital on , the

third floor at 116 South Michi-V
gan——the hospital which served

    

 

uncertainty plaguing today's college graduates.

Senator Clark hopes to bring order to the present_ fiscal situation
by cutting the budget. This he termed the “Democratic way.” Ac-
cording to the senator, the Republican way “would be to slash Federal
programs and create programs for white people.”

Mr. Schweiker felt that our welfare system should train people
for skilled and semi-skilled, jobs, rather than giving handouts. He stated,
“People want hands up instead of hand outs.”

Senator Clark opposes the current Administration's Vietnam policy.
He advocates a cease fire and a holding policy until free elections can be
held under supervision of the International Control Commission.

Senate hopeful schweiker summarized his position by stating that
“the political system we have been using badly needs reforming. Its
main trouble is that it has not been able to modernize with the chang-

According to both medical co-
ordinators, most injuries were
scalp cuts on the back of the head
There were many broken hands
and wrists, many of the young
men were hurt in the groin. Our
most serious case was a young
woman of perhaps 20 who has
broken ribs and a suspected rup-
tured spleen.”

Miss Hayes said ther were at
least 1000 people treated for
burns and other complications
caused by gassing. “We had ten
medical teams here,” she said,
“and each team worked on about
100 people who had more than the
superficial effects of gassing.”

Other medical aid stations scat-
tered throughout the city treated
more than 250 casualties. Taken
together. well over 1200 people
were hurt during the week. The
most intangible figures are for
people who made it on their own
or with friends to hospitals, and
the “scores of those we just didn’t
have time to get to.”

So now, perhaps, we have the
American Brotherhood syllogism:

The delegates will tell them the

that they didn’t know a thing, or
that there was nothing to it.

The television reporters reach
the same conclusion as other re-

But the public nature of the in-
quiry, the inherent suspense, the
fact that very prestigious person-
alities would leave the main bus-
iness of the convention to pur-
sue it—all of this invests in the ru-
mor a substance it does not de-

there never had been such a move-

F  Soul to Psychedelic
Chase Discusses Today’s Popular Music  

 

 

by VIRGINA JOYCE

Todd Chase, handsome, young
disc jockey at KQV radio station.
revealed his monumental know-
ledge of music with his opening
comment at a Pitt News interview
Tuesday night.

“I don’t really know anything
about music." he admitted. “I
just throw in different terms and
comments to confuse the listen-

3!

€I'S.

After this description of his
abilities, Chase went on to offer
definitions of the most popular
types ‘of music now pervading the
KQV sound survey.

Since he constantly refers to
“underground” music on his 7
a.m.-12 noon show, Chase began
with this form. “Underground mu-
sic is music that is not played on
the air, yet it is a hit anyway,” he
said.

“As for ‘psychedelic’ music,
well, it never existed before a cou-
ple of years ago,” he went on. “It
_had its origin with the word ‘psy-
cho’ referring to ‘freak-out.’ I
don’t know why the ‘delic’ was
added. Maybe it referred to Del-
ic, Ohio,” he laughed.

5* ,“Underground and psychedelic

music are the same thing. So is
‘progressive rock,” said Chase.
“All these terms refer to the same
thing.”

Chase attempted to ‘trace the
development of these “modern”
forms of music now enjoying
widespread popularity. “The first
group to experiment with progres-
sive rock was the Beatles. The
Jefferson Airplane came after the
Beatels,” he began. “Then a mon-
tage of groups came after that.”

tent and background of “soul”

Why DO You
Hcwe A Poor
Memory

A noted publisher in Chicago
reports -there is a simple‘ tech-
nique for acquiring a powerful
memory which can pay you real
dividends in both business and
social advancement and works
like magic .to give you added
poise, necessary self-confidence
and greater popularity.

According -to this publisher,
many people do not realize how
much they could inﬂuence oth-
ers simply by remembering ac-
curately everything they see,
hear, or read. Whether in busi-
ness, at social functions or even
in casual conversations with
new acquaintances, there. are
ways in which you can domin-
ate each situation by your abil-
ity to remember.

To acquaint the readers of
this ‘paper with the easy-t<_)-fol-
low rules for developing skill in
remembering anything you
choose to remember, the pub-
lishers have printed full details
of their self-training method in
a new booklet, “Adventures 111
Memory,” which will be mailed
free to anyone who requests 11;.

music were equally penetrating.
“Soul had its basis in the old
rhythm and blues music. It goes
back to 1957 with Elvis when
rhythm was first put with blues,”
he offered.

“Going further back than that,
the origin of soul music was in
the songs that the Negro used to
sing, the religious songs. Even to-
day, there’s a religious undertone
in the soul music. Take ‘I’m a
Girl Watcher’ by the 0’Kaysions.

That song is a good example of
soul music,” he stated.

Chase revealed that he prefers
sould to psychedelic music be-
cause “psychedelic has no heat.
lt’s just a lot of noise.”

While the new disc jockey be-
lieves that the “new” music has
gained such popularity from the
fundamental predisposition of
“kids to adopt something new all
the time.” he hedged predicting

      

r

what direction the present trend
will take.

“Who knows what direction mu-
sic will go in.” he mused. “It may
go simpler with three basic chords
again. The Beatles, for example,
with Hey, Jude are going back to
the Elvis Presley style. W h o
knows? Elvis may make a come-
back,” he posed.

“You know,” Chase said at the
end of the interview, “Ididn’t
realize that I knew so much about
music.”

You’re not going to believe
this, but the Freshman class has
five members whose names be-

sidering that there are only sev-

three “Andersons,” this may
prove to be a unique class.

The winner of the name- .3

class, however, is the group of
six newcomers whose names be-

Catagorization always involves
an annoying amount of smug-
ness. expecially when a person or
creati.e genius falls under the
catagorizr=.r’s hand. Yet, in an at-
tempt to ;plain why I chose a B
film like Angels From Hell to
review, I must (in all humility)
present a simple but effective
method of movie catagorization.
With this system, movies fall -un-
der four catagories: Good-good
films, gad-good films, bad-bad

 films, and good-bad films.

A good-good film achieves suc-
ces where you'd expect to find it.
Darling Morgan, Dr. Strangelove,
Breathless, the Knack, and Blow-
up are all examples of good-
good films becuase they set

out to do something special and I

were successful.

For- me, the classic l:'—‘ good
film is The Graduate Which; .pired
to reality then tried to convince
us that an above average look-
ing, wealthy, athletic, well—dress—
ed young man could go through
four years of college and emerge
a social idiot. Funny, but think
about it.

Some really bad-bad films are

_G;idget Goes Hawaiian, Jason

 and the Argonauts, Beach Blanket

Bingo, and just about anything

with Elvis Presley, Jerry Lewis,

‘ Frankie Avalon, Johy Wayne,

or Diris Day. .These films try

. nothing and are barely worth the
celluloid they are printed on.

A good—badie, on the other hand,
is so terrible that it’s great. Like
the High Camp discovered in the
Batman series or those ludricous
Japanese imitation horror films
where the hero says something

‘W and it comes out three seconds
. later. So awful that you just have
to alugh.

Angels from Hell is so terrible
that you’ll love it. Full of half-
pint Marlin Brandos who say
things like “wiggy” “groovey,” or
“I like to feel the wind in my

 ‘Pitt News’ Review 2:

‘Angels from Hell,
So Bad You’ll Love It

 

The hassle with the local police
starts when the gang taunts a
rookie cop and he panics. In re-
taliation. two men in blue over
react and beat a member of the
gang to death in the back seat of
their squad car. The town’s police
chief then finds that he can’t
even controll his own men and
more hostilities erupt.

“Mn, how can we do our thing
if squares" run the world?” be-
moans the leader of the gang to
the head hippie of the community
where they seek refuge. And so,
the film even has a point to make:
What are the rights of a subculture
when the majority finds them re-
prehensible?

Angels From Hell is a good
time. No camera tricks, no pre-

tension, no plot; just one.point

and a lot of genuine motorcycle
and hippie freaks from Bakers-
field, California.

school as a “transmitter of know-
ledge and as.a force for incunca—
tion of the community’s culture
contrasts with the greater em-
phasis on research and enhancemei

of knowldge characteristic of the;

colleges and universities.” This
closer affilation with the local
community and its values dis-
courages the system from view-
ing itself as an independent aca-
demic community.

The ACLU feels that the prin-
ciples of academic freedom and
civil liberties must be applied to
the secondary school system.
The pamphlet states that if new
generagions are to acquire a feel-
ing for civil liberties, they must
live in the midst of a community
where civil liberties are exempli-
fied; the high school should be

A such a community.

Some of the policies set forth
in the ACLU pamphlet are as
follows:

—Teachers should be free to join
unions of their choice a-nd to
participate in any of the union’s
activities.

——If a student’s pricccipled
convictions lead him to refuse
to salute the flag or to take an
oath of allegiance, he should be

—A teacher should be free to de-
what should’ be taught and how it
should be taught, free from dicta--'
tion by the community.

— If a student’s act might lead
toexplusion from school or nota.- _
tion on his record, he should have
the right of a formal hearing.

—A student’s appearance should *7
be of no concern to the school
unless it interferes with its educa; 
tional process.

—0utside theschool a teacher
should be allowed to dress, act,’

 Panthers Could Win 1

Last Saturday afternoon, Purdue slammed Notre Dame, 37-
22. Sunday morning, stories crept into the South Bend papers
- questioning Ara Parseghian’s ability to coach in crucial situa-

tions.

Ara can’t win the big game was the general sentiment. The
, stories were not surprising. Afterall, Parse

Part of the hesitancy lies in.the fact that few of the assis-E a .

tants come from “big-league” football backgrounds. Looking
down the list, it is evident that this is afairly substantial claim.

But without reflecting on the individual coaching abilities
of these men—be they good or bad-consider one other point. It
is extremely difficult to hire “big-league” assistants when the
salary offer might be considerably less than any college grad-

uate would expect to make.

For instance, one of Hart’s original assistants is now at

Almost Sold on William and Mary   
Ray N ow Gets Opportunity Here

by MARTHA HARTLE

Ray Reppert has been waiting a long time to show what he
can do on the gridiron for the Panthers. He may get his chance
tomorrow when the Panthers face William and Mary at the Sta-

Recruited by Dave Hart as a quarterback, Reppert has been switch-
ing positions ever since his freshmen year. This week the Junior from
Beaver, Pa., made still another switch — this time to wingback — and it
may give Reppert the chance he’s been waiting for.

“I have no regrets about coming
to Pitt; I like the glamour of the
big name schedules and the nice
trips. William and Mary plays
on a smaller scale then Pitt.” .

But Reppert had high praise for
the bootball program at William
and Mary and the particularly
cited Coach Levy. “They have a
tremendous program,” he em-
phasized. “Coach Levy is a great
guy and he really knows-his-foot-
ball. So do all their coaches.”

Despite the two opening games
this season, Reppert is optimistic’
about the Panther showing tomor-

row. He noted improvement in the '

practice sessions this week, ex-
pecially in the running backs and
offensive line.

“Overall, we look more unified
than before,” he commented. “In
the first few games, one or two
players made mistakes which

Saturday, the Panthers aren’t being motivated.

Sure, it can be saidethat once a player gets out onto the
field his personal pride and desire to do well should provide
enough motivation. But many times a player will think he’s per-
forming at maximum capabilities when he isn’t, because he

‘hasn’t been properly prepared.

But isn’t it also strange that throughout the first two weeks
of the season, rarely have individual players blamed them-
selves for poor performance? First the offense will blame the

and eventually the head coach.

It is the opinion here that everyone shares in the blame

' for two miserable losses this season.

Most of the coaches and players are good people. For the;
/ most part they honestly like one another. The assistants, as well
i» as Hart, have had the players to their homes. But there IS a bar-

rier of falseness that separates the two.

Some players don’t understand that at times the coaches
must be two-faced for the players own good, such as in rela-
tionships with the press. But the coaches don’t understand that
they’re working with bright kids that don’t fall forphony rah-

But they are no longer a soft
touch on anybody’s schedule.”

That’s for sure. Last year the
Indians posted a winning re-
cord. Their quaterback Dan Dar-
ragh is now starting for the Buf-
falo Bills of the American Foot-
ball League.

This year’s team hasn’t allowed
a touchdown while splitting their
first two games. The Indians sur-
prized East Carolina 14-0, then

 

- rah business or a “Hi, how are ya?” that’s insincere.

The last couple of weeks have been hard ones. But for the_
coaches, at least, it’s been a time for learning. They’ve seen;
some of their mistakes and have admitted them. Perhaps now:—:

they understand the personnel better, too.

It’s time to try and put everything back together. Each side
5 has to yield a little. But, fellows, don’t think about yourselves

and your petty gripes. Think about football.

Tomorrow the Panthers meet William and Mary at the Sta-
dium. The Indians are tough, but we’ve got the talent to blow

Long TD, No Injuries

 Keep Tri-Captain Skip
 Optimistic -For Future

 

By MARTHA HARTLE
‘‘All we need is one game.”
That’s the'cure which senior split end Skip Orszulak pre-

1 scribes for the winless Panthers.

“Losing haunts you,” explains the tri-captain from West Mifflin.

“When you have your hopes built up at the beginning of the season
— and then take a hard defeat, it’s hard to come back. Instead you re-

vert back to the last two seasons.

Drange Pick May Red deni‘Bubba’

 

 

i ‘ offense
' tomorro

All we have to do is win one
game.”

Orszulak interpreted the Pan-
ther problem as a mental one. He
explains that ‘the Panthers were
not outmanned against West

.Virginia, but just weren’t pre-

pared mentally for the Moun-

I taineers.

“The week after the UCLA
game, we‘ were in a daze,” Skip
admitted. “Everybody was flat.

(We weren’t prepared mentally
. for West Virginia. We just were-

n’t up for the game.”

That’s not the case right now,
however, as UCLA is two weeks
behind and a “thing of the past,”
according to Orszulak. “Things

’  are different now,” he continued.
. “We really want to win this week.”

Although William and Mary is
not a big name opponent, the Pan-
thers are not taking them lightly.
“I don’t think we’re in a position
to take anybody lightly at this
point,” -quipped Orszulak, “In

"fact, William and Mary may be

taking us lightly. The team that
wants to win the most this week
will win. We’re certainly not‘ out-
manned this week.”

In last week’s contest with

‘West Virginia, Orszulak scored

one of the Panther touchdowns
on a 68-yard pass from Dave Ha-
Vern, and he indicated that the
‘igay be going to the air
‘ as well. _

“We’ll pass this week,” ex-
plained Skip, “but we should es-
tablish a better running game
than last week because William
and Mary is not as strong in the
defensive line. But we'll probably
end up passing a good bit too.”

“We basically went with pass-
ing against WVU because they
were . using single coverage on
us and our receivers had more
speed than the defenders,” he
continued. “The touchdown pass
was a lucky play. They gave us
a lot to the inside and the play
clicked. I was just in the right

/ place at the right time.”

Plagued by injuries, in his
first two varsity seasons, Orszu-
lak has remained healthy this
fall. “I've stayed -healthy. be-

cause I’m better prepared in a
sense. Before, I got knocked off
early in the season and couldn’t
even practice. Then I’d come
back and not be in shape. This
year, everything’s been real good.”

Despite the poor showing of
the Panthers so far, Skip is hop-
ing to attract the attention of the
pro scouts. “Ive been counting
on playing professionally for 14
years,” he explained,” and if I’m
lucky enough to be drafted, I’ll
play for anybody. It helps to play
for a winner and attract publicity.
but basically the scouts look at
the individual.”

Tomorrow, Skip is confident
that his team will be a winner.
And that one ‘win “is all we
needf’

Hawks Face Hawks Alumni

In Season Opener Sunday

By LENNY MAYS

-This week’s football game of the week will be held Sunday,
morning at the Oval where the incredible Pitt News Hawks host
a motley crew of Pitt News Hawks alumni.

“For the alumni,” remarked Sports Editor Roy “Jumpshot”
Jacobs, “it will be the toughest game of the year, besides being their

only game.”

Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstein, ex-Sports Editor, predicts a close game

for his aged team.

“It’ll be close alright,” cried Rosenstein, “We might not field
enough men, but it’ll be close. . . .maybe five men, instead of six.”

The Hawks alumni are coming from all over the country to parti-
cipate in the first Hawks-Hawks Alumni Game ever played. » 5

Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstein walked all the way from Brooklyn,
New York, or at least that’s the way it looks. The alumni head—coach

hasn’t shaven or washed in six days.

Jumpshot was almost right,
but Bubba missed his target
when he kicked his shoe at the
Sports Editor’s mouth.

"“I’ll get you next time,” cried
Bubba in frustration.“ “But you’ll
have to stand a little bit closer.”

Bubba will also have to buy a
new pair of shoes because the
shoe he kicked at Jumpshot went
out the window and was stolen
by Cinderella’s step-brother, Lou
“The Toe” Groza.

“You can bet I’ll never pick‘

barefooted. Once again the recip-

“It’s psychological,” explained Flatbush, “Not only did I get

my first exercise in seven months, but now I'll look mean and tough
when I face those younger Hawks.”

Mike “Hawk” Brourman is planning to fly in, but he hasn’t
found a flight that costs less than thirty-five cents.

“What happened to Orville Wright’s baby,” moaned Hawk, “I’m
not proud.”

The alumni line will be bolstered by local starslHob”ie “War-
monger” Harris and Jimmy O’Brien.

But the alumni don’t seem to have the speed, weight, brains, or
talent of the incredible undefeated Hawks. Paul “Benito” Stoller
and Jerry “LeRoy” Gruebel should give the Hawks alumni trouble.

“If we run as fast and as far as we could go,” rationalized “Benito”,
“they’ll get heart attacks.‘ Hawk hasn’t run since the last Columbia
riots.

Quarterback Roy “Jumpshot” Jacobs will be taking the snaps
from center Art “Bubba” Rosengarten.

But the big offensive threat will be handled by veteran half-
backs Dave “GI” Tiernan and George “Moustachio” Lies.

“I’m playing quarterback because I can’t run or throw,” explained
Jumpshot, “but GI and Moustachio will probably run options on every

play.” . . _

IBM invites you to join an infant industry.

Big as it is, the information processing
industry is just beginning to grow.

Recently, Fortune estimated that the value

of general purpose computers installed in
this country will more than double by 1972.
Other publications have other predictions,
and probably no source is totally precise. But
most agree that information processing is
one of America’s fastest growing major 1
industries.

Every day, it seems, computers go to work
in a new field or new application. IBM com-
puters are working in such diverse f.ields as
business, law,’medicine, oceanography,
traffic control, air pollution. Just about any
area you can name.

To somebody just starting out, this growth
means exceptionally good chances for
advancement. Last year, for example, we
appointed over 4,000 managers—on
performance, not seniority. Here are four
ways you could grow with IBM:

Engineering and Science

“The interdisciplinary
environment keeps I
you technologically
hot.”

    
   
 

“Working in data process-
ing today pretty much means ,_
you work in a broad spectrum ‘
of technologies,” says Nick 9'
Donofrio.

An Associate Engineer at IBM, Nick is a
11967 graduate in Electrical Engineering. He
designs circuits using MOSFET (Metal Oxide
Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor)
technology.

Nick says, “Your specialty at IBM can take
you into the front yard of half a dozen dif-
ferent fields. In my job, for example, I work
with systems design engineers, chemists,
physicists, metallurgists, and programmers.
The diversity helps me keep up to date on
the latest technologies.”

‘Career areas in engineering and science
at IBM include: Research, Design & Develop-

ment, Manufacturing, Product Test, Space
and Defense Projects, and Field Engineering.

You’ll need at least a B.S. in anytechnical field.

Marketing , _

“Working with
company presidents
T is part of the job.”

 
   

‘‘I’m pretty much the
IBM Corporation in
the eyes of my
customers,” says
Andy Moran. ‘‘I
consider that fairly good for an engineer
who graduated only two years ago.”

Andy earned his B.S.E.E.in1966.Today,
he's a Marketing Representative with IBM,
involved in the planning, selling and installa-
tion of data processing systems.

Andy’s customers include companies with
annual sales ranging from 20 million

to 120 million dollars. He often works

with executive vice-presidents and presi-
dents. Andy says, “At first I was a little
nervous about the idea of advising execu-
tives at that level. But by thetime I finished
training, I knew I was equipped to do the job.”

Career areas in marketing at IBM include.:
Data Processing Marketing and Systems
Engineering, Office ‘Products Sales, and
Information Records Sales. Degree require-
ment: B.S. or B.A. in any field.

“It’s a mixture

‘Finance

“You’re in an ideal
spot to move
ahead fast.”

  
  
   

“|’ve always figured my
chances for advance-
ment would be better
in a growth industry.
That’s why I picked
IBM,” says Joe’Takacs.

Joe’s been working
in general accounting

since he got his B.B.A. in June, 1968. Growth
wasn’t the only reason he chose IBM. He
says, “I learned that it’s general practice at
IBM to promote from within and to promote
on merit alone. I like that.

“Another growth factor is the job itself," Joe
says. “During my first few years, l’|l get experi-
ence in nearly every area of general account-
ing-"Income & Expense, Balance Sheet,

and so on. l’ll be learning how the company

is structured and how it operates on a broad
scale; That’s exactly the kind of knowledge

l’ll need to help me qualify for a manager's job.”

Career areas in finance at IBM include:
Financial Planning, Financial Analysis,
Pricing and Business Policy Development,
Accounting, Information Systems, and
Internal Auditing. You’ll need at least a
Bachelor's degree.

Programming

 
 
    
  
   
 

of science
and art.”

“A computer
is prac- 
tically use-
less until some-
body writes a  —
program'for it,”  """ "
says Earl‘ Wilson.  ' 
Earl got a B.A. in Modern 
Languages in June, 1967.
He’s now an IBM programmer working on a
teleprocessing system that will link the
computerized management information
systems of several IBM divisions.

Earl defines a “program” as a set of
instructions that enables a computer to do a
specific job. “Programming involves
science,” says Earl, ‘-‘because you have to
analyze problems logically and objectively.
But once you’ve made your analysis, you
have an infinite variety of ways to use a
computer’s basic abilities. There’s all the‘
room in the world for individual expression.”

Career areas in programming at IBM include:
Systems Programming, Applications Pro-
gramming, Programming Research, and
Internal Programming for IBM's own use.
You’ll need at least a B.S. or B.A.

Other reasons to consider IBM

_‘ 1. Small Team Concept No matter how large
a project may be, we break it down into

units small enough to be handled by one
person or a few people. Result: quick recog-
nition for achievement.

2. Educational Suppgr_t. IBM employees ‘
spend over thirteen million hours a year in
company-sponsored educational and training
programs. And plans like our Tuition

Refund Program could. help you get your .
Master's or Ph.D.

3. 300 Locations. We have almost 50 plant,
laboratory, or headquarters locations and
over 250 branch offices in key cities
throughout the United States.

4.,Qpenings at All Degree Levels. We have
many appropriate starting jobs for people at A
any degree level: Bachelor’s, Master’s

or Ph.D. " ’ ‘

 Rivals Avert Shut—Out

by ROY JACOBS

 By Taking Fifth Place

Sports’ Editor

Happiness for cross country coach Jim Banner is when you ‘
have a couple of sick runners and still manage to take eight of the

 "first nine places in a dual meet.

The sick runners probably didn’t enjoy the race very much, but in
, the end the harriers had a 16-47 victory over Cleveland State. The
 i» score was just one point shy of a shut-out, cross country style.

_ Four varsity runners tied for first in a time of 21:42. Jerry Richey,
who wasn’t even supposed to make the trip but went along as insurance

because some of the others weren’t

course and finished in a virtual
draw with teammates Greg
Rodgers, Paul Zink and Mike No-
lan. —

Then four other harriers mak-
ing the trip-Ken Lawton, Mark
Vornhagen, Bill Matajasic, and
John Aiken finished one after the
other behind the only Cleveland
State barrier to crack the top
five finishers-Mike Pecoulis,
who finished fifth.

For 'Banner’s harriers, it was
their third straight-and most im-
pressive-win to date. The first two
wins came in triangular meets,
both by comfortable margins.

Actually, some of the team mem
bers weren’t particularly enthus-
ed by the win because they didn’t
consider Cleveland State a cali-
bre opponent. In fact, Coach Ban-
ner is seriously considering drop-
ping them from the schedule.

“We just took it easy,” review-
ed Jerry Richey. “They weren’t
really any "competition. The race
was pretty uneventful.

“The course was miserable,”
he added. “It was flat and ran by

too.” Teammate and roommate
Greg Rodgers basically concur-
red. -

“I thought it was a good race,”
he remarked,“but it was fairly
easy. It wasn’t a hard pace.

“Actually,” he continued, “it
was kind of enjoyable. We didn’t
have to push too much.” A

Even though the harriers were-
n’t pushed, they will still have
plenty of time to rest up before
their next meet. They don’t com-
pete again until a week from to-
day when they enter the Notre
Dame Invitational. It’ll be a good
chance for the team to cop a first-
class title and for Richey to bounce
back into the national spot-
light. .

In the meantime, Coach Ban-
ner is happy with the progress of
some of the runners outside the
top five. Mark Vornhagen is
coming along quickly after be-
ing slowed by a leg injury while
seventh ‘and eighth men Bill Ma-
tajasic and John Aiken are con-
tinuing to improve their times.

to have a Jerry Richey to fall

be in Pittsburgh, not Mexico
City. He’ll see the Olympics on
television and he’ll be watching
the other guys——the guys that made
it. But Jerry doesn’t think about
the Olympics much any more.
He has more important things on
his mind.

“Every once and awhile I think
about the trials and about the guys
that made it,_” he admitted. “But
I mostly have other things on my
mind, like school and cross—coun—
try. I just have to face the real-
ization that I didn’t make it. But
right now I can say I’m over the
disappointment.”

Richey worked hard in Calif-
orniatbut the high altitude train-
ing had no ill effects on the lan-
ky runner, either mentally or
physically. “I don’t feel any
effects at all,” he explained.
“I’m in good shape from the train-
ing, but I’d be in just as good shape
if I had trained back here.

“There’s no difference in run-
ning at high‘ altitudes, except
that you go slower. The altitude
just slowed everybody down out
there,” he commented.

“I’m not tired at all,” he con-
tinued. “I’m in_good condition.
I just really enjoy running.”

Richey was slated not to make
the trip to Cleveland State with
the barriers Wednesday He was
supposedly going to rest. But Rich-
ey made _the trip his vacation will
come later.

“Even if-I hadn’t made the trip '
i to Cleveland I wasn’t going to

rest anyhow,” Richey explain-
ed. “I would have run twenty miles

JERRY RICHEY
Not (.'e!ting Stale

back here. I’ll probably take a

week off sometime, maybe when

cross-country season is over, but

I’m not sure. I just do what the

coach says. He gives me some time
off when I’m stale, but right now

I’m not sta1e.”

Richey emphasized that he was
his cross-
country now, but their’s not much
pressure involved with it. Looking
ahead to the NCAA and IC4A

cited runners from Holy Cross
and Georgetown as top flight com-
petitors.

Martin Liquori, the Olympian
from Villanova who edged Rich-
ey in the freshman IC4A’s’ last
season, won’t be competing in
that race this year, but Richey
commented that Liquori is pro-
bably not as strong over six miles
as he is in the shorter distances. In
last year’s freshmen competition,
the course was only three miles.

“I wouldn’t consider Liquori" a
factor in a race over six miles,”
explained Jerry. “In fact, I don’t
know if I can be considered a fac-
tor over six miles.”

So, for the present, Jerry Rich-
ey is a harrier with his sights
set on the NCAA and IC4A cross-
country championships. But no
matter how hard he tries, somehow
he can’t forget the past summer
when the Olympics were so close.

But there’s always the future.

‘Teams Near Finals

by MIKE WALDHOLZ

The dormitory softball intramurals had a busy week. as the
schedule became trimmed in preparation for the championship
games next week. For most teams it was their second or third

This means elimination if they’ve lost one and a spot in the

championship if they are undefeated.

Playboy Penthouse. with a record of three wins, no defeats. is
the inside favorite for the championship. In their latest game

swamped Stratford House 17-
5. Although playing a superb
game offensively, the victory
was due mainly to the defensive
plays of Pat McClellan at short-
stop, Jim Barber at third and Bob
Freschi at shortcenter. The of-
fense was aided by Ron Rudin’s
four hits and Ed Paluzzi’s home
run. Going into the. ,champion-
ships the team has the added
punch of last year’s star, Dick
Shore, who has just come off the
disabled list. Shore is oneplayer
who remembers last year’s champ-
ionship game defeat of 11-10 and
says he wants “revenge.”

Tow other teams with unblem-
ished records also have a chance

-for the championship. Panther

House boosted their record to two
wins, no losses by defeating Pea-
nuts Gallery, 26-6. Ken Lang,
the winning pitcher, was most ef-
fective by making the ‘opposing
hitters pop out consistently. John
Cassiani led the team with two

*i‘~‘Home runs and was backed by
 ~ Scott Stevenson’s homer and two

other hits.

. In the semi-finals Panther
House will belpitted against Mad
House with an identical record. In
its last game, Mad defeated the
House of. Lords, 4-3. The game
was highlighted with Mad’s fif-

‘ teen hits and by the sparkling play

of Steve Tritch. Steve made two
good defensive plays in certer-
field and drove in the winning
run in the botton of the 7th in-

 ning. Jim Burret also sparked

the offense with three hits as Derm
Winter and a two for three day
and scored the winning run. ‘

Doing well in the loser’s tour-

nament is last year’s champs,‘

Fitherland House. They posted a
‘in agaii.-fst the House of Lords,

. 5-10. -Th game was marred with

errors . emingly caused by. the
gravel on Trees Field. Win-
ning pitcher Mark Pease was ai-
ded by a 12-run 5th inning that
broke the game wide open. Third

Qbaseme .1 Ken Macha-sparked the/

inning with a three ‘run homer.
Also highlighting the game was
the defensive play of rightf_ield—
er Bob Kmiecik and shortcenter
Al Silverman.

By defeating Peanuts Gallery
5-2, Litchfield House’ also even-
ed its record at one win, one loss.
Limiting the opposition to two
runs-was pitcher Steve Borecki.
Backing him up defensively
was the solid play of shortstop
Bob Chmielewski, while Steve
Solnoki hit two homers and Bob
Cizmarik hit one.

Champions
Next Week

The fraternity intramural soft-
ball season is drawing to a close
with championship games in both
divisions slated for next week.

Thursday, October 10th, Phi
Kappa Theta will play_ Pi Lam-
bda Phi for the winner’s brack-
et in “A” division. In “B” di-
vision, Pi Kappa Alpha is schedu-
led to play Kappa Sigma for the
winner’s position Monday, Oc-
tober 7th. The winners of each of
these games will then compete
for the league championship.

Phi Kappa Theta won the right
to compete in the “A” dividion
finals last Thursday when they
defeated Delta Sigma Phi by a
score of 13-3. Bill Weber was

the winning pitcher. Pi Lambda»

Phi qualified for the finals the’
same day by defeating Sigma
Alpha Mu 16-3. Steve Rosen-
baum Pitched for Pi1Lam.

In other A dividion action,
Phi Eqsilon Phi beat Delta Sig-
ma Phi by a score of 12-5,
thanks to a nine run first inning.
Scott Sookik pitched for the win-
ners. Phi’Ep will play Delta Tau
Delta next Friday for third place
in the losers’ bracket.

In ‘‘B’’ division action, Pi
Kappa Alpha qualified for their

division finalsy be defeating Phi

Gamma Delta last Wednesday,
byia score of 11-4. John Meteney
and Mike Dilorio pitched for the
winners. The game went into ex-
tra innings when Pi Kappa Alpha
tied it up 4 to 4 in the 7th in-
ning, and then went on to score

-seven more runs in the eighth in-

ning.

The Fiji’s eliminated Delta
Phi on Monday by a score of 11-
6. Pi Kappa Alpha also ‘defeated
Sigma Alpha Wpsilon and Theta
Chi in their last two games.

Although Pi Lambda Phi is the
defending champions in “A” di-
vision, Phi Kappa Theta may be
a dark horse for Thursday’s finals.
They have the momentum after
defeating a strong Phi -Ep team.
In “B” division, Pi Kappa Al-
pha look like early favorites, al-
though the versatile Kappa Sigma
team should give them a good bat-
tle. A

THE KEYSTONE BOYS
Welcome All
         I

by ED CONLEY

Every member of the soc-
certeam thinks they can win.
Despite some pretty disas-
trous outcomes so far, not one
of them will admit failure.

Coach Leo Bemis agrees with
his athletes and constantly tells
them that they have the ability
and that they will come through
if they don’t give up. The players
keep telling themselves this, too.

Tomorrow, the booters should.

get their best chance to prove
that winning is possible. The op-
position is Slippery Rock, a team
that Bemis’ booters have had
great success with down through
the years. They hold an 11-1-2
advantage over Slipper Rock,
with one of the ties coming last
fall.

Thus far this season, Slippery
Rock has a 1-2 record. They have
lost to a strong Ohio school, Den-
ison, and to Grove City.

Bemis expects his squad to fin-I

ish on top tomorrow, but reali-

zes that Slippery Rock is no push-»

over, expecially for his team
which hasn’t scored a goal.

“They have their outside right
and outside leftiback, and they’re
pretty. good competitors. In fact,
they have 4 of 5 linemen back
this year,” the coach mentions.

This should indicate ‘a strong
offense, unlike that of the kicker’s
which has played only two games
together. Bemis agrees that the
line should be good, but he in-
terrupts, “unless we're tough on
defense.”

He feels that his teafh isn’t
as strong on defense as it should

be, but thinks that it is “fairly re- A

spectable.” His offense has also
shown improvement in its scrim-
mages this week, in his opinion.
“Actually,” he says, “Over all we
look better.” '

Over-all with the exception of
passing, maybe. This is the one
area that the coach knows needs
a lot of development. “We’re
just not as good as we could be,”
Bemis relates.

Booters Face Slippery Rock,   I
Expect to StartWinning Soo

iioorffns BBIJCE. SearfossW(l0) and Mike Schalk (17) defend against‘,
West Chester line. Searfoss has impressed Coach Leo Bemis in his ef-.5
forts to gain a first-string spot in the kicker’s “fairly respectable” de-V‘-,-

fense.

The biggest problem with the
passing is that the ball is up in
the air far too often for a team
as short as the booters. “They’re
trying to keep the ball on the
ground. They realize that theyfre
not a head ball team,” the coach
states.

I didn’t know exactly what kind
of team we’d have this year,”
he says, referring to his views
before the season started.

“I thought we’d have to depend '
on sophomores. But, actually, it’s
the development of the upper-
classmen that has been import-
ant,” he continues.

This is because of injuries to
two of the important sophs, Con- .
ference‘ Lekoma and Cliff Arbes.
Arbes appears at full strength,
now, but Lekoma is still question-
able.

The two upperclassmen who
were subs last year and are impres-
sing their coach this year are
backs Wayne Kaiser and Bruce
Searfoss.

Bemis decides, “Except for
this, we are at about what I_ real-

GOALIE LEN Harmon makes one of his many fine stops against West
Chester. Fullback Mike Schalk is in on play, as Norm Roux (16) , another
defensive stand-out, looks on.

Pete Snyder
Opens Frosh 
Boot Season  

Pete Snyder gets his first
crack at coaching in an act-
ual game tomorrow as the_.~— .,
freshmen booters visit the un- ' 
derclassmen of Slippery Rock.

Last year’s team split a two 
game series in the rivalry. ’ ‘

Snyder really can_’t be ,expect- ..
ed to know what's going to hap-I
pen in tomorrow’s game because.
the frosh kickers also have never
played when the goals counted.

The only time that they have _;-_
seen -a game situation has been in '
the scrimmages against the var-._
sity. These outings were all _~'
pleasing to Snyder, despite the-'-
fact that they all resulted in losses. ' ‘

“The boys were giving the var- 
sity good tough fights and I"
hope all the mental errors will
be corrected.” ' 7

The simple mistakes were what»-
Snyder felt brought the downfall
in the practice games. He feels
thatthere is hope that they can
“put it all together, Saturday f0I‘f‘.'
a win.” "

Half of the 18-member squad 6
has had no soccer experience at _
all. These players have shown 1 ’
vast improvement since the open-«
ing of practice. The rookie coach ‘ _‘
states, “they’ve all improved as ..
lot and are working out very,
well.”

In fact, he is sure of their abii- }'_I "
ity. “Individually, they’re all? '_ V
sound players. But, this is their
first opportunity to work to- ,
gether. They’ll have to work bet-. , ‘
ter as a team,” he comments.

This is why Snyder has been I
emphasizing quickness and pas- .. .
sing in the drills. The only way to ’ -
correct such a problem is by time, j 
and the frosh have had three to
four weeks of it. ..

They will have the whole season
to get ready for varsity play, =
the real reason for the freshman
‘team in any sport. But, for that_f,_

After two games and two losses, the Panther football squad A
of Dave Hart has begun to regroup and reconstruct just like it
was spring practice all over again. The results of this recon-
struction will be on display tomorrow afternoon at Pitt stadium
starting at 1:30 p.m.

‘We’re trying to get as simple as possible in our defense and in our
execution,” said Hart. “We must decrease the number of our mistakes
if we-’re ever going to win.

,“We cannot perform the plays for the players, but we (the coaches)
must be able to. get the boys aggressive. That’s something it seems we
haven’t been able to do yet,” said Hart, as he shook his head.

In order to increase the ag-
gressiveness of the gridders, Hart
has had them do more contact

work, almost as much as they did
in fall camp. They'll be in the
best condition since the days lead-
ing up to the UCLA game.” ex-
plained Hart.

The Panthers will have to be
their very best against an under-
rated William and Mary squad.
“I don’t know that they’ll be the
worse team that we’ll play this
year,” explained Hart. “Public
opinion seems to say that they are,
but after seeing the films, I don’t
believe it.”

_ The films showed the gridders
that the Indians are fine defen-
sive team. They have never allow-
ed their opponents to cross their
goal line so -far this season. Wil-
lian and Mary’s only loss came
about by a blocked punt, a safety,
and a field goal. “I think that
William & Mary plays defense like
Alabama,” was the way Hart put
it.

Freshman coach John Rosenberg,
who scouted the Indians last week,
says, “They are a well coached,
sound fundamental football team,
and are capable of coming up with
the great effort. Overall, it won’t
be an easy game for Pitt.”

Besides the toughness of Wil-
lian and Mary, the Panthers have
to rebound from a series of in-
juries and bad breaks which have
plagued them. Lost for Satur-
day’s contest are linebacker Ralph
Cindrich, wingback Joe McCain,
Don Plusquellic and possibly
Lloyd Weston.

The absence of Cindrich and
Weston has caused Hart and his
staff to make some moves. Out-
side linebacker, co-captain Ed
Gallin, has been returned to the
middle slot, where he played last
year. In addition, fullback Jeff
Brown has crossed the line and
will be at one of the linebacking
slots.

Plusquellic has left the team
as well as the university. “Don’s
pride was hurt that he wasn’t able
to perform up to the standards
that he showed as a freshman,”
was the way Hart explained it.

Plusquellic’s spot will be taken
by Chuck Winters. Frank Gus-
tine remains as the number two
quarterback. ‘

A bright spot is the return of
“Ez” Ed Whittaker to the of-
fensive line. Whittaker joins up
with Art Alois and Greg Ellis,
two boys who have shown consis-
tantly fine performances in the

‘ first two games.

“If all our lineman were like
Ellis and Alois, then we would be
in business,” praised Hart.

Replacing McCain will J. D.
Lewis in the backfield. Lewis,
who has been used sparingly,
caught a two-point conversion pass
against West Virginia. Another
change in the backfield is full-
back Phil Sgrignoli, who will al-
ternate with Tony Esposito and

the number 2 spot behind fullbaclgw-

Gary Cramer.

The defensive secondary has
been shaken-up in an effort to
curb a weakness which has given
up 642 yards in two games.
Junior George Pribbish has been in-
serted as the prowler and Dave
Dibbley has moved to a defen-
sive halfback slot.

“Our main problemhas been our
tackling, said Hart.

“We thought we had it correct-
ed before West Virginia, but we

hope to have it finally correct- ‘

ed by game time Saturday.”

If the Panthers can finally ex-
ecute all the fundamentals and
cut down on careless -mistakes,
then there is a good chance that
the Indians of ‘William & Mary
w'll b their first victory.
