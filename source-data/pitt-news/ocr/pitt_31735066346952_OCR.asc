Summer school, institutes, special classes and the ad-
vent of hot weather are beginning to shake even the inveter-
ate third—termer’s faith in year round education.

He first felt the difference between the two regular
trimesters and the spring trimester last winter when he
registered. That the Spring Timetable had fewer pages and
more white space than the winter edition made it clear that
fewer courses were being offered. Of course, enrollment
and faculty numbers are lower. But, he was assured by all,
you will suffer no drop in quality of instruction. After all,
the same teachers are often teaching the same material
they present in the winter.

   
  
   
     
  
  
   
    
   
   
 
   
   
   
  
  
    
 
   
  
   
   
    
  

Until early June quality seemed about the same. Per-
haps a few teachers were handling classes others had car-
ried in the winter. Or some seemed too overburdened to
prepare adequately. But these situations could occur during
any term.

Then summer school opened; language institutes were
‘presented; special institutes began; scholarly rendezvous
beckoned to faculty members.
they had no time to teach, or at least teach third term, sum-
mer, and special students as adequately as they had hoped.
_fI'hey began to collect more cuts than some of their more
religiously absent students. To prepare for summer school
sessions they released classes early, assigned sessionsto
graduate assistants, shortened papers, dropped tests. Stu-
dents began to notice their instructors’ sudden penchant
for spontaneous discussion and furtive trips to read papers
A in other cities. They became annoyed when they were
evicted to sparsely ventilated classrooms so that larger
summer classes could be accommodated. A
Now they are wondering if their status is somehow in-
ferior to the new arrivals, if their $28 does not buy as‘ much
credit in the summer as it does the other two terms. Try as
they might, they really can’t place all of the blame on
their teachers, many of whom are buried under work for
classes arranged on two, sometimes three separate schedules.
Those who witnessed the same diﬁiculties last summer know
they are not merely suffering from an unfortunate selection
at of courses. .

I  where does the difficulty lie? is it the trimester
system itself? This would be an unfair generalization after
only four years of operation. All the student undergoing
thesummer trimester of 1962 can say is that he has bought a

In the midwest, locusts blacken the sky and
devour all the ripened crops; in South America,
Army Ants sweep over the terrain, denuding the
area of every shred of vegetation; In Oakland it’s
Buc Rooters who swarm in ruth-
less masses, gobbling all avail-
able parking spaces.

Like inhabitants of a seacoast
town battening their shutters for
an imminent hurricane, 0ak- 
landers begin to prepare for the
evening game at sunrise. Yellow 
tags proclaiming, “No Parking 
After 6 pm.” are slung about 
tempting-looking parking ‘meters. t
Later, auxiliarypolice are dis-
patched to the area in militia
quantities. Penant vendors begin wandering the
street about supper time. Worst of all, those frus-
trating “Ballgame Parking, $3.00” signs are dusted
off and leaned against gasoline pumps, hamburger
stands and the picket fences of private homes.

Then the hordes arrive. They roll in in battered
convertibles, sneering limousines, school buses,
ﬂreetcars and every other form of vericular trans-
portation known to the twentieth century baseball
fan. And everyone of these forms must be stowed
somewhere, usually in a choice spot some Pitt stu-
dent has discovered, cultivated and defended since
last September.

. Inside Peace Corps

A few weeks ago there arrived on campus 97
individuals from almost every state’ in the Union.
Some are single; others are married. Their ages
range from 19 to 61. Despite their individuality,
they are bound by a common
purpose: to serve in the Peace
Corps, a New Frontiers’ en-
deavor to promote world-wide
good will.

I have seen them study, lis-
tened to them debate, heard
them sing -_— at midnight in the
quadrangle —-- and have spent a
typical “Peace Corps Day."

On a day which began —— as
every day begins for them ——.at
7 a.m., I managed to navigate to
the breakfast table. There I was greeted by 97
smiling faces. How they managed to appear so
awake at that hour is beyond me. After drowsing
through a typical breakfast conversation--“Have
vou ever seen a Tsetse fly?” —- I stumbled along up
the hill to Scaiffe Hall, noting that the climb was
a unique phase of their physical training.

An air-conditioned room, a soft chair, but four
hours of lecture.
quest.ions were flying. The topics for the morning
varied from childbirth among the Liberians to

secret societies and witch craft. One would think .

that after such a morning lunch would be a wel-
come diversiﬁcation. But the meal time conversa-
tion concerned such topics as tribal lineage 'in
Liberia and two dozen ways to prepare rice.
Mental‘ Noam: ‘ .

After lunch I sat in on a mental health group.
Then. back up the hill to a lecture on African an-
thropology.

Again that evening we returned to the lecture
hall. This time to hear a lecture and participate
in a question and answer period on the position
of the American Negro. The questions exempliﬁed
the fact that these trainees are not willing to ac-
cept statements at face value.‘ They questioned, de-
bated, arid argued, so that each one could resolve
for himself the truth that hefmight be able to relay
this truth to the natives of Liberia.

I realized my day with the PCV’s (Peace Corps

  
 

By Bernard Trumpower

Some time after midnight. I reviewed the day
and began to realize that here was one of the most
intensive but yet thorough cram courses I had ever
witnessed. One professor had commented. that the
trainees covered in one day a topic which he nor-
mally distributes over a trimester. In addition to
attending twelve hours of classes six days a week,
the Corps members obligate themselves to read .4‘
additional material on subjects varying from teach-
ing methods to driver ants.

In their spare time—-—though I don’t see that
they have any—-they worry about malaria, tropical
diseases, and of course, problems which they might
encounter with the natives. But still they eagerly
anticipate August 23 when they will arrive in
Monrovia, Liberia, where. after a brief period of
orientation, they will be assigned various positions
throughout the country.

About one third of the volunteers will teach in.
elementary schools. The remainder will be assign-
ed to secondary schools. Some will ‘work in towns
or in Monrovia. For others the Liberian project
will mean a two year stay in the “bush.’,’ Two years
of living with natives, many of whom speak no. ,
English. . , 
‘ﬂy Remains A

With these handicaps it remains the duty of the
.‘CV to teach English, fundamental mathematics,
and basic health science. The female volunteers
will be confronted with such tasks as serving as
midwife for African women; the fellows may  ~
to organize sanitation crews.

The trainees anticipate these things but ane-
eager to work with the natives, to learn their cul.-v
ture, and -to convey a few higher standards of ,
liViﬂl- It will be an experience for many in roughe _ a
ing it in the bush, in teaching children who, are .
anxious to learn. It will be invaluable training 
which these volunteers can later carry into ‘gov- if U’

rnmental work if they so desire.

The program will not be without flaws. There
vill possibly be more “post card" type incidents.
The results of the effort will not be seen immedi-
ately. Many times they will feel their work has’
been futile. But in the end they will have served
a basic American purpose. They will have given,
to apenple who want it, a taste bf
