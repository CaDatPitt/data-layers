The services of two attorneys
have been retained by the Resident
Student Association’s Inter-
Residence Board (IRB) to advise the
board on legal matters pertaining to
the visitation policy approved last
week by Pitt administrators.

Robert A. Creo, a Pittsburgh at-
torney, and his associate Mary
Ellen McMeekin have been
employed “for consulting. and
negotiation services,” according to
Terri Slack, chairman of the Resi-
dent Student Association. ,

tenure decisions,” he said. “Pro-
fessor‘Porter has the opportunity to
appeal the decision through the
regular channels.”

Under existing guidelines, a
faculty member must be recom-
mended for tenure by" his/ her
department, followed by considera-
tion from a review committee con-
sisting of six faculty members from
other departments at the university.
The clean of FAS then reviews the
recommendations of both groups
and makes a ‘final decision on

‘ whether to ‘award ordeny tenure.

Although details of tenure deci-

sions are not released to the public, ,

informed sources said Porter receiv-
ed favorable ratings from both his
departmentand the review commit-

through a legaldefense fund that
has been started by RSA, said
Slack. Students who oppose the
new policy will be asked to con-
tribute.

Creo was presented at last night’s
IRB meeting in the Tower A con-
ference room. IRB members
reviewed recent events in the move-
ment to oppose the new policy and
discussed possible strategies for the

_ future; -

Rade Vukmir, an IRB member,

and Slack reported on a meeting-
yesterday with Senior Vice
Chancellor Jack Freeman concern-

tee. From the department’s faculty,

three people voted in favor ‘of
tenure, two v.oted against it, and

one ‘abstained, according to the
sources.

According to Porter, the reasons
given him for histenure denial in-
cluded that he was not a good

"teacher, he did not have a national

impact in the field of black studies,
his published material’ was not of
good quality, and he did not possess
a doctoral degree. * '
Porter believes his work in the
Black Studies Department was not
considered fairly by Rosenburg and
that much of it was misunderstood.

Tentative proposals to move
fraternities "to on-campus sites and
to build a graduate housing facility
adjacent to the Bristol Apartments
on the corner of Dithridge and
Bellefield streets were discussed by
Pitt officials at an informal meeting
with local citizens at Synod Hall,

Wednesday night.

Senior Vice Chancellor Jack
Freeman and Director of Facilities
and ‘ Planning Hunt Martin,
attended the meeting to discuss the
new university proposals and to

“We want to minimize any
negative impact on the communities
by working with them on these pro-
jects,” Freeman said. '-

The main focus of both proposals
is to “improve the _ quality and
scope of the housing” available to
students, said Freeman. ,

Freeman acknowledged that the
presence of fraternities has been of
concern to these area communities.
He added that there have been
“abortive efforts over a good many
years” to move fraternities to on-
campus sites. .

The university has_produced two
suggested proposals to move frater-
nities closer to campus,‘ according
to Freeman. ’ "

Oneproposal calls for the con-
struction of a housing complex just

‘above Pennsylvania Hall, off _ of _

Aliquippa Drive, said Martin.

The second plan includes the
reconstruction of McCormick Hall
in the Schenley Quadrangle as an
apartment complex for fraternities,
said Martin. This would be similar
to Amos Hall, which presently
houses some sororities on-campus,
he added.

There are questions, said Martin,
of fraternity acceptance of this
plan. According to Freeman, the
university has been in touch with
some fraternities to discuss the
feasibility of the plans. , ,

While the proposals. do have’ the
advantage of being much less ex-

 Organized Opposition To Draft Registration Developes

will be “greatly affected” becauseix.

By SETH LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer

Organized opposition to registra-
tion for the draft surfaced Tuesday
night at a forum sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh Chaplains
Assocation in David Lawrence
Hall. ‘

Talking to a small university au- I

dience, the speakers presented their
opposition to President Carter’s
call for registration for the draft
and offered strategies and help to
students opposing the draft.

‘‘It is in your own self-interest to
fight this registration for’ the
draft,” said Rev. Barry Lynn, na-
tional chairman for the Committee
Against Registration and the Draft.

“Simply, mere registration is
what they (the government) want
you‘ to believe,” Rev. Lynn said.

“Don’t believe it,” he continued.

“Registration constitutes about the

SBA, GPSA Dispute Continuing  

being the size of the departments. -

By JEFFREY S. GRUNEWALD
\ Pitt News Staff Writer '
The dispute between the Student Bar
Association [SBA] and the Graduate

'Professional Student Association

(GPSA), although unclear at times, con-
tinues. Last term the bar association at-
tempted to withdraw from the parent

’ ' group, but the proposal to secede was

voted down.

GPSA, made up of 15 graduate stu-
dent organizations, was established in
1973 and reorganized in 1974 to repre-
sent the graduate student body in the
administration. .

According to Gerry Musinsky, ad-
ministrative assistant of GPSA, “The
type of things we do are university-wide.
We try to affect university decisions.
For example, they (the university) have
asked for our help with the TATF

(teaching assistant/teaching fellow)
issue. ”

“The only service they (GSPA) pro-
vide is the copying and binding service

students,” said SBA president Ross

ever invented. ”

Rev. Lynn was referring to the
fact that the Selective Service, when
registering a person for the draft,’
obtains records ranging from
subversive organization affiliations
to school and health records. He
wondered who will be able to obtain
these records after the Selective Ser-
vice has gathered them and put
them on file.

Rev. Lynn also fears that the
government “won’t stop at registra-
tion.” A

“Once they have the machinery,

. they'll be tempted to use it,” he

said.

Rev. Lynn said that there can
never be a “fair draft”, that the
college students and wealthier
members _of the society who can af-
ford good doctors and lawyers will

“always find loopholes in the
system.”
Carol McCullough, vice-

Schaub. “If they can’t help us, we want
to withdraw. We can run our own af-
fairs. We’ve been in existance a lot
longer than GPSA.” ’

SBA has had various problems with ‘

GPSA over the years and has found
limited use for their services, according
to SBA members. The current dispute
stems from a wide variety of charges in-
cluding representation, funding, lack of
quorum at meetings and the actual ser-
vices provided by GPSA.

Each graduate student organization,
except for the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS) and the School of
Education, has one representative on
GPSA. The two exceptions each have
three representatives.

SBA claims this creates a power base
that is hard to overcome.

“Even if a majority of the schools
agree on a proposal, those two schools
can override that majority,” said Mark

' Hindin, treasure of SBA. '

“There are two reasons why those
two schools have three representatives
each,” explained Musinsky, “the first

president of the Pennsylvania_Na-
tional Organization for Women,
said NOW is taking a “non-violent
posture,” and that they “are
against registration for the draft for
either men or women.”

But she said that in the event of a
draft, women should be drafted as
well. "

McCullough was also concerned
about “rampant sex discrimination
in the military” where only 10 to 15
percent of available jobs are
presently open to women.

She asked, “What makes people
think women can’t ﬁght in combat?
If women are to be ‘drafted, the‘
military will have to put women in
combat.” "

“Perhaps we should start by sav-
ing them (women) from the combat
roles they are forced to assume in
civilian life,” she added.

Mellon University and state chair-

Those departments contain almost two-
thirds of the graduat students at Pitt.

/' “The second reason is that FAS, in

particular, has three is to balance the
number of reps between ‘the graduate
and professional schools.”

The amount of funding received by’
GPSA is directly proportional to the
amount of funds each graduate student
organization receives from Student Af-
fairs. Oirrently GPSA receives approx-
imately 20 percent of each graduate stu-
dent organization budget.

The law students claim that since they
don’t use the association’s services very
much, they shouldn’t be required to
pay such a high percentage..

“The amount of money which each
GSO should provide should be directly
proportional to the amount of services
they use, ” said Hal Eskin, SBA
representative to GPSA

The use of some of the money for a
luncheon/ meeting this weekend, at
which tilet rnignon will be served, was

also questioned. I

peculiar that the government isn’t

debating the rationing of the lives
of our young people.”

Professor Kerr released evidence
obtained from a Freedom of Infor-
mation suit against the Selective
Service stating that Pitt and other
local universities will be used as
registration points, and he
wondered if “these universities had
made arrangements with the Selec-
tive Service,” and “what type of
cooperation the universities will
give to the Selective Service.”

tions” of registration. >

Tom Kendall, who went to prison

I N Call For Draft

By The Associated Press

a" President Carter will call for the

registration of women for the
military draft, White House officals
said Thursday.

\. The White House scheduled an
announcement for Friday detailing
the president’s plans for the entire
draft registration program.

The president’a proposal,
disclosed by officials who asked not
to be identified, is a sharp break
with historical precedent. It will be
the first time that a president has
suggested registering women for the
draft.

Carter decided to include women
in the program despite a warning
from House Speaker Thomas P.
O’Neill that it would not pass the
Congress.

v The president probably will imit
registration to persons 19 and 20,

though full details were not made
available.

Carter announced plans last
month in his State of the Union
message to resume’ draft registra-

tion, citing an increasing military .

threat from the Soviet Union.

. Although he remained" mum on
the question of whether he’ would
include women, but he has
previously taken the position that
any such program should include
women.

4 In recent weeks, Carter’s decision
has been foreshadowed by
statements from administration of-
ficials and the president’s wife,
Rosalynn, 'who urged registration
of women.

Currently, there are about
150,000 women in the military, out
of a force of 2 million. However,
women still are banned by law from
combat.

Dean Jerome Rosenburg,” Porter
said at the time of his resignation.

According to Porter, his denial of
tenure resulted from a long-
standing series of disagreements
between himself and Rosenburg. '

‘‘I don’t see how the dean can sit
on a committee and objectively
make a decision (about Porter’s
tenure),” he said.

Porter will appeal the ‘tenure
denial “within the framework...-;of

«the institution and outside,-’»" he‘

said. Outside appeals will be made
to colleagues and members of the
community who know Porter’s
work.

Also, Porter has consulted his at-
torney concerning possible legal ac-
tion against the university if the
denial of tenure is not overturned.

Porter said his past history of
confronting the administration and
demanding solutions to problems
may be one of the underlying
reasons he was denied tenure.’

Students offered their opi-
nions and suggestions on what
possible lines of recourse could
be taken against the proposed
changes in the existing

Most of the students who
shared their views expressed in
different ways a common basis
for their grievance—the

“I don’t really disagree with
a change in the visitation
policy, because the present one ’

guests go, they can just ﬂash a

Smith. “I don’t think having
girls out of guys’ dorms at 2
a.m. would do much good. I’d
say 95 percent of the running
around goes on usu-
ally after 2 o'clock will happen
before then. The percentage of
girls and guys in each other’s
rooms is minimal at that time
of night,” Smith said.

“I don’t think much was
really accomplished tonight. I
think we, as students, are over-

reacting,” said Smith. “It very
well may be an infringement on
students’ rights, but I don’t
think that the meeting on Tues-
day will stop the change from
being made unless students br-
ing up more valid reasons why
it shouldn't be passed than for
rights alone.”

“The Board of Trustees will
put up with our yelling and
screaming about rights, if, in
the end, it means more money
from Harrisburg because of
it,” said Smith. “If the yelling
and screaming that went on at

. the forum with Dr. Kimbolast
Monday night happens again,
it willwork against us.” '

Darryl Lincoln, . a

sophomore, didn't believe
security would be improved by
the new policy. '

“It’s just a showpiece for
Harrisburg to get the addi-
tional funding they’re asking
for,” Lincoln said. “I think
the meeting had some impact,
just by the fact that it called at-
tention to us by the number of
TV cameras and outside news-
people who came.”

Lincoln said that the meeting
served as “mostly an exercise
in student participation.” The
point needs to be made that
policies that directly affect
students should consider their
opinions before the final deci-
sions are made,” Lincoln con-
cluded.

housing availability’ in the area,
Freeman said that he was “more
optimistic” that these plans could
draw fraternities presently faced
with rented quarters or no housing,

The proposed plans could house
approximately 16 fraternities, noted
Freeman. _

A plan to build a graduate hous-
ing facility at a site on Dithridge
and Bellefield streets was also pro-
posed to the citizens’ groups.

Over the years, Freeman said,
suggested housing sites near the
Veterans Administration Hospital
and Bates Street have fallen
through because the plans had little

city or community support. In fact,
a resident group from the adjacent
Bristol Apartments voiced “vehe-
ment opposition” to the new site.
However, the site has “always
been considered as a future location
for housing,” he said. He added
that housing constitutes the most
critical construction need of the
university. _ '
Plans for thegraduate housing
complex, include 83 units in a nine
story apartment-like building and
could house approximately 400
students, according to Freman.
Freeman said the apartment com-
plex would probably cost more. but

the limitations on the type of stu-
dent and appearance of the building
are an attempt to takeinto account
the surrounding neighborhoods,
which consist of a great number of
elderly residents.

When a member of the Bellefield-
citizens? group, stated that 400
students .was a “drop in the
bucket,” Freeman responded, “We
are attempting to satisfy the needs
of students unable to find any or
adequate housing, so 400 is a
significant improvement.’ ’

Freeman also said that over 40
percent of Pitt’s students are in
graduate and professional schools.

iPos’var, Corporate Executives

Hold Similiar Interest In Forum

By MIKE CONLEY
pm New: sum Writer

What does Chancellor Wesley
Posvar have in common with the
chief executive officers of corpora-
tions like Westinghouse and
Rockwell International? For one,
an interest in the Business-Higher
Education Form.

The forum is the two-year-old
creation of Jack Peltison, head of
the largest association of its kind in

the country, the American Council I

on Education.
Ed Bozik, assistant chancellor,
said the forum’s purpose is to make
~“efforts to establish relationships
and a higher degree of understan-
ding and co-operation” among the
leaders of the business and
academic communities. It provides
the opportunity for these ex-
ecutives, on a national level, to
discuss areas of mutual interest.
The forum convenes two or three
times a year to discuss topics such

as energy, environment, productivi- .

ty, labor-management relations and
biomedicine according to Bozik.
For example, one area in "which

Pitt has a shared interest with cor-
porations is in the effects of govern-
ment regulations. Both institutions
of learning and the business world
must cope with an ever-expanding
body of government rules and red
tape required by the government,
Bozik said. He added that one
forum subcommittee in which Pitt
is involved hopes to deal with that
complex problem. ‘

Bozik said such cooperation has
not always been easy for the
academic community and the
business world. During the Viet-
nam War, he noted that distrust of
the military-industrial complex and
fears of campus unrest may have
hindered communication.

Today, the high number of Pitt
graduates who go on to work for
major corporations is indicative of
the vital «links between the two
fields, according to Bozik. Industry
is interested in employees who have
been taught the ‘knowledge and
skills to be competent managers and
technicians, while institutions like
Pitt depend on money and support,
generated by corporations, to grow

and prosper, Bozik said.

Bozik quoted Chancellor Posvar
on that matter, saying “Education
is one of the best capital in-
vestments. ’ ’

parent), according to Vukmir.

“The policy might not be (in loco
parentis) to the same extent as it
once was, but it’s still in loco paren-
tis,” said Vukmir.

IRB members again stated their
contention that the new policy

‘violated several provisions in the
.'§‘Student Code of Conduct, in-

cluding the rights for students to
organize their own personal
behavior and to have a say in deci-
sion making at appropriate levels of
the university community.

Vukmir added that the new
policy contained nearly none of the
recommendations made by the task
force formed to review the visita-
tion policy currently in effect.

Vukmir, Slack and Robbie The,
chairman of the IRB’s security
committee, will attend a luncheon
meeting of the univel'sity»Board of
Trustees’ student affairs committee
Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. They will
also attend the meeting of the entire
board later that day (3 p.m.) in
Forbes Quadrangle.

Vukmir said, “We know we’re
right, but we better be able to show
it (to the Board of Trustees).”

Several students at the meeting
stressed the need. for rational
behavior by students who attend the
Board of Trustees session. Alan
Mele, a Student Government Board

member, said he though behavior-

like that at Monday’s IRB forum
with Kimbo would be counter-
productive to students who are
against the new policy.

Student Government Board
President’ Bill Abraham also
stressed the need for rationality.

..H 3 added that the students at

'Tuesday’s Board of Trustees
meeting should focus on getting the
trustees to order another review of
the residence hall regulations.

‘ ‘The thing is policy—it’s the way

suade the student affairs committe

Abraham said after the meeting.

Pitt News Staff Writer

Student ingenuity once again rose

to the occasion Wednesday in an at-
tempt to get some attention. The
occasion was an arm-wrestling tour-
nament sponsored by the Tower B
—RSA council. .
Conceived by Tower B council
representative Richard Smedley, the
tournament was organized ‘mainly
as a promotional . event, with a
secondary objective of raising some
money.‘ i ‘

' The tournament was divided into
six different classes. For the men,
the classes were:' "light weight ( 140
lbs. and under), medium weight
(141 lbs.-215 lbs.), and super heavy
weight (216 lbsfand up). In addi-
tion, there was a special class‘ for
women.

In all the classes, the winner
received a trophy, plus dinner for
two at Shannon’sA Restaurant
(formerly Cicero’s). Prizes were
also awarded to the second, third
and fourth place winners. ’

As far as the turnout _of con-

testants was concerned, the event
was somewhat of a disappointment
to organizers. Only some 66 people
signed up for the tournament, and
that includes no-shows. _

Perhaps the biggest disappoint-
ment was the fact that only six
women signed up, and only four ap-
peared to compete.

One of "the female ‘contestants
blamed the poor turnout on the fact
that there were no separate weight»
classes for women. -

It was apparent, though that the
audience didn't mind as a large

crowd gathered to watch the pro- .
ceedings and cheer their favorites. .

The attendants running the event
indicated that they were really

suprised at thecrowd reaction, and ’

somelpassing viewers wrote the oc-
casion off as “zoo.”

After the competition, the final
winners were: Kelly Parker in the
Ladies class, Chris Femiani invthe
light weight class, Rick Meyers in
the medium weight class, Greg Corl
in_ the light heavy weight class,_ Jim-‘
my Keemer in the heavy weight
class, and Randy Macmillan in ‘the’

. super heavy weight class.

When asked about why they had
entered, most of the contestants
answered “kicks,” or “try to win a
prize.” ' '

By NICK ARNETT ween 10 a.m. and 2 a.m. However,

come two o’clock, just when you’re
probably feeling warm and settled
down for the night, campus police
will burst through your door.

“Okay, you two in the bed. Are
you of the opposite sex? Just as I
thought. Hit the road, bucco.”

. What a rude awakening. Imagine
what it's like for gays.

you of the opposite sex? What?
You aren’t? Oh. Sorry we

It doesn’t seem fair to

I've figured out who’s behind’ the
new university dorm visitation
rules. It’s the gay liberation people.
These rules are clearly designed to
favor gays.

Rule B-l states, “An overnight

sex as the occupant(s) in the room.”
It’s obvious that normal heterosex-
ual relationships are ruled out dur-
ing the night and early morning
hours. There are no similar restric-
tions on members of the same sex.

Of course, you can have fun bet-

preferences. I wonder just which of

the university -administrators are,

behind this thing.

Let's take a look at some of these
other rules. “A guest is defined as
one who is visiting at a campus
residence at the invitation“of a con-

. tractural resident.” This is clearly

designed to allow heterosexual rela-
tionships between contractural
residents, but not with outsiders. Of
course, outsiders can have relations
with other outsiders—outside.
Wasn’t that what Bayard Street
residents were complaining about?

“A resident cannot sign in more
than five guests at one time.”
Right. What would one do with
more than five people in your
typical dorm room? Whatever
they’d do, they’d have to do it
together—but they couldn't. do it
between 2 a.m. and 10
a.m.—because rule B-6 limits orgies
to two visitors plus contractural

residents, who may be of any sex. '

does change guests regularly, it can
still last only thirty days. I

‘Let’s see, how ‘does this all fit
together? I can have five peopleof
any sex visit me during the day. At
2 a.m., I have to kick three of them
out, leaving two who are of the
same sex as me and my roommate,
assuming’ of course, we are of the
same sex. I have to stay with all of
my guests at the same time, so they
have to stay in one group. I can
have as many contractural residents_
as I want, of as many sexes as I
want. I think I can keep this
straight.

Oh, I forgot something. My
guests have a three-day limit within
each two-week period. I guess they
have to decide if they’d rather use it
up a little at a time, or all at once.
One good weekend, and you’re shot
for half a month.

The last rule is the sneakiest. “All
guests must deposit an identifica-

upon signing in. The. I.-D. will be
returned upon leaving the residence
hall.”

Friday, Febtruary-'8, 1§st)—nage?I .. 

I was still fuming after reading
about Pit‘t’s new proposed visita-
tion policy in The Pitt News, when I
came across a column by Nick
Arnett, which can easily be cited as
the most misguided article concern-
ing the draft and the nature of war
that I have ever read. I will not con-
demn Mr. Arnett for sharing his
views with us; It is, everyone’s con-
stitutional right to express their

‘W-‘pinion.

First of all, Mr. Arnett is quick to
condemn those who “fearful1y
refuse to fight.” As I look out of
Towers’ window, I can see South
Oakland and most of Mount
Washington, and I can easily envi-
sion the entire area being an-
nihilated in an“ instant. I‘also recall
photos of war victims; headless,
legs blown off, chests blown off,
chests blown open, burned to a
crisp. You can pay a visit to
Veteran’s Hospital and get a good
look at the living victims of war. Is
it wrong to be afraid of being taken

prisoner and tortured? No, it is not ‘I

wrong. It is justified. After all,

. didn’t most of us grow up watching

the Vietnam War on TV?

Secondly, Mr. Arnett stated in
his column that Iranians and other
citizens of Moslem and communist
nations do not identify themselves
as indiyiduals. This is a very broad

v generalization. On what facts does

 
 

a

        
 



Mr. Arnett base this statement?
How many Iranians has he inter-
viewed?
Thirdly, Mr. Arnett states that to
kill a man who belongs to “a nation
that calls itself a community rather

than a group of individuals” is

merely wounding that man’s na-
tion, not killing the individual. He
goes on to say further that “when‘
another nation threatens us...it is
justifiable to wound.” What kind
of “Archie Bunker Logic” is this?

What Arnett is trying to say is

‘that when another nation threatens.

the U.S. it is justifiable to kill the
men, women, and children of that
nation. In the very next sentence
Arnett states, “It is wrong to kill.
We need only to disable.” This, my
friends is hypocracy. '

Mr. Arnett’s statements _,are an
insult to those of us who happen to
believe that every man, woman, and

child’ on this planet are individuals. '

I wonder if Jesus Christ would
,disagree with me on thatpoint. It
seems to me that Mr. ‘Arnett is look-
ing for some justification for killing
people.‘ ' ’
Mr. Arnett may -be ready and
willing to bedrafted, but there are
hundreds of thousands of young
Americans who are much less will-
ing, and many who have the
courage to say no to the draft, and
have the courage" to face prison or_
exile for what they believe to be a

for materialism. Mr. Arnett would

- have neither lost his life, nor his

wallet on the bus. These two are
not equivalent. Even the analogy
between this episode and the crisis
in Afghanistan and Iran is a false
one. The United States does not
own Mideastern oil. The threat to
our accessibility to this oil is hardly
enhanced by the Soviet lpresence,
since the Arab states have shown
their willingness to impose em-
bargoes in ‘furtherance of their
policies. In this regard we should
be more concerned with‘ developing
new energy sources; not with war.

The concern of the United States
for the rights of the people of
Afghanistan and Iran is nothing but
pretense. Our interest revolves
around election year. politics. It is

Finally, I am sorry it did not ‘

preferable to killing him, to
neutralize the aggression without
physical injury is a greaterlmoral

With a week of needed rest under
their belts, the Panther wrestlers
take off for the cold, cold North
this weekend for dual matches
Saturday night and Sunday after-
noon. Taking on the brisk weather
may turn out to be a minor problem
for the‘ Panthers, however, com-
pared to dealing with the two very

good wrestling squads they will be
facing on this trip-Michigan and
Michigan State. '

According to Panther head coach
Rande Stottlemyer, 'Pitt’s wrestlers
may be better off concentrating on
preparing themselves mentally for
this weekend’s upcoming
onslaught. He is realistic about
what could be in store for his grap-
plers in Michigan.

From the initial tip the Pan-
therette basketball team was in
command of the game. The game,
however, soon turned into a
massacre as Pitt slaughtered Slip-
pery Rock 93-48. The Pantherettes
now boast an 18-8 record going into
this weekend’s contest with LaSalle
College.

Pam Miklasevich started the
onslaught for the Pantherettes,
swishing a jumper after 15 seconds

of play. Penny Welsh canned a
shot, Miklasevich added two, and
Gail Aughburns banked one in to
give Pitt a 10-4 lead after five
minutes of play.

Two quick baskets by Slippery
Rock brought the score to 10-8, but
that was the closest the Rockets
would get all night. Two buckets
each from Welsh and Miklasevich
wiped away all hopes the Rockets
had of upsetting the powerful-Pan-
therettes.

A rash'of Pantherette mistakes

with about three minutes remaining
in the half allowed Slippery Rock to
score eight unanswered points.
However, that was only good
enough ‘to close the gap to 42-27.
The Pantherettes quickly swished
two shots to give them a 48-29 edge
at the half.

The second half marked‘ the

Pitt basketball Panthers this
season, each member of the trio has
accomplished something that no
matter how hard Pitt tries, it just
can’t pull off. Namely, winning‘ at
West Virginia University.

Why is it everyone else can look
forward to playing in Morgantown,
while Pitt almost automatically
resigns itself to what will probably
be a very frustrating afternoon in

A West Virginia.

Not that the Panthers have not
come close. Last week’s two-point
loss to the Mountaineers played
within the screeching confines of
WVU Coliseum was typical of Pitt-

WVU games south of the Penn-'

sylvania border. ~ The margin for
Mountaineer victory is always thin,
but a margin all the same.
Emotions have something to do
with this situation [WVU owns a
9-1 record over the Panthers since
the Coliseum was built], although
the Mountaineers have not been
utilizing much of their talent this
season and are much better than
their 9-11 record indicates. '
Games played in Morgantown
also held a special. horror in recent
years for Pitt’s next opponent, Du-
quesne. Ex-mountaineer Bob Hug-
gins got Dukes’guard B.B.
Flenory’s collegiate career off -to a
crashing start three years ago when
his elbow to Flenory’s head resulted
in a concussion. While the Dukes
led the following year by Flenory’s
29 points—won in Morgantown,
1979 was a weird story in itself.
Flenory was alwaysthe target of
constant harrassment in Morgan-
town, and before one game, ‘saw a
picture of himself in the WVU stu-
dent newspaper, hung in effigy. '
B.B. skipped the contest that day

I

and was roundlv criticized for it.

The Dukes had no such problems
Wednesday night, as they won a’
49-38 pass-around ‘game in West
Virginia. While comparing wins

and losses against mutual op-
ponents as is about as accurately in-
formative‘ as the local weather
forecasters of late, the Dukes’ win
was a notable accomplishment,
though hardly surprising.

Pitt has won four straight coﬁﬂ‘
tests over Duquesne, dating back to
the end of its 6-21 season three
years ago. The two-point Panther
victory over the Dukes last month
was deservedly called a thriller, but
look for a different texture this
Sunday.-

Coach Tim Grgurich’s Panthers
finally got a rest this week after
beating Eastern Kentucky,v80-78,
but all the rest in the world still
can’t erase the impact felt by the
loss of point guard Dwayne
Wallace. Pitt will just have to make
do with only one experienced ball
handler against the taller, heavier
Dukes, although the bench has been
especially admirable of late.

Duquesne has already secured a
home court advantage for the open-
ing Eastern Eight playoff round,
and with a little help from league-
leading Rutgers, the Panthers will
also.

The Scarlet‘Knights play WVU in
at Rutgers tomorrow in the Eastern
Eight’s televised Game of the
Week. A Rutgers win would mean
all Pitt has to do to finish in the top
four of the league-thus securing a
home court for the playoffs-is win
just one of its remaining four
Eastern Eight games. _

FREE THROWSi Villanova has
crept its way ‘up into the second-
place position in» EAA standings.
The Wildcats sport a 5-2 league
record and visit the Field House
Feb. 20... Villanova was a 74-72
winner against George Washington
Wednesday night... Should both
Pittsburgh teams play’ first-round
tournament games at home, there is
talk of playing one game at 7 p.m.
and the other at 9 p.m. the avid fan
can rush ‘around from Field House
to Arena or vice versa...

Tough Competition

Michigan is led by All—American
Steve Fraser at 190 lbs. Fraser will
probably match up against Pitt’s
tough but inexperienced Kurt
Kuranovich.

Of particular interest to most-

Pennsylvania wrestling‘ fans will be
the projected battle at 134 lbs. be-
tween Pitt’s Glenn Nacion and the
Wolverines’ Bob Siar. Siar, a
freshman, is one of Michigan’s top

points in the second half.
Surprisingly, the game did not
turn into a free-for-all. Both the
Rockets and the Pantherettes
refrained from making unnecessary
fouls. Onlylll shots were taken
from the charity stripe the entire

evening. Pitt was a perfect 5-for-5_

from the foul line, while Slippery
Rock went 4-for-6.

Miklasevich pumped in 16 of her
20 shots from the floor,. plus four
foul shots, to give her 36 points on
the night.’ Lewis canned 19, Welsh
18 and Aughburns 14 to lead the

/

wrestlers and last year’s Penn-
sylvania state champion. ,
Another match to watch will be
in the 150 lb. class, which will set
Panther Mike Bond on a collision
course with Michigan’s talented
John Beljan. Bond and Beljan have ’
both recently returned from in-
juries. .-

They are Ellen Malone (12.6 points

After a- heartbreaking loss to
West Virginia last week, Pitt’s
men’s swimming team will attempt
to get back on the winning track
again with two home meets this
weekend. The Panthers will host
Cincinnati Friday night and
Cleveland State Saturday after-
noon. ‘

In Cincinnati, the Panthers will
face a team that includes several
former Olympic champions.

“Cincinnati will be very tough to
beat,” said Panther head coach
Fred Lewis. “They have some very
talented swimmers, some of which_
are Swedish and Norwegian.”

Pitt currently owns a 6-1 record
and defeated the Bearcats last year
58-55 by winning the last event of
the meet.

“They [Cincinnati] swam very
tough last year and we are expecting
another close battle Friday,” said
Lewis. “It should be very in-
teresting because both teams are so
closely matched.”

Pitt will once again rely on its two
nationally ranked swimmers, Rick
Carter [No. 3] in the 100-meter
freestyle ‘and Stu Swanson [No. 9]
in the 200-meter backstroke events.
Also "competing for the Panthers
-will be Sandy Pidgeon in the
200-meter breaststroke and Scott
Winkler in the diving events.
Winkler and Swanson set new pool

records at West Virginia last week

while Carter and Pidgeon were also)"
victorious. _ » 

When the Panthers meet]. ‘

Cleveland State Saturday after-E»
noon, Lewis will be doing some ex- 7

perimenting. -

“We will be trying to put
together both of our relays——the
medley and the freestyle—against
Cleveland State,” said Lewis.
“Cleveland State is well-balanced
but a little weak in the sprint-
freestyle and breaststroke. We are
healthier this week than we were
last week, and I’m expecting both
our relays along with our divers and
breaststrokers to do well.”

Coach Lewis indicated that
although Cleveland State is ex-
tremely respectable, it does not
possess the firepower that Cincin-
nati does, and he hopes to find the
right combinations in the relays so

they can qualify for the Eastern '

regionals in early March.
A special note of interest concer-

ning last week's loss to West

Virginia, Pitt’s first in_ three years:
Brian Conrad and Brian Gibson,
the heroes of the WVU victory, had
originally decided to enroll at Pitt
upon graduation from high school
At the last minute, though, they
decided to attend WVU instead.
Two swimmers who were almost
Panthers came back a few. years
later to haunt them by stopping the
nation's longest winning streak at
28 meet wins.

small breather, the Panthers travel
to Michigan State Sunday after-

 noon to challenge the Spartans, a
._  team that may be better overall than
j Michigan.

“Both Michigan » and Michigan

. State are pretty solid. the whole way

down the lineup, ” said Stottlemyer.

_ “Michigan State really has a

veteran group. They have a good

experienced crew from 118 to 142
lbs.” -

An early match that may begin
the abandoning of that crew is the
contest between 118-pounders
Glenn Maxwell of Pitt and H.
Milhouse of the Spartans.

One measuring stick of the
Michigan State team's performance
was its early season clash with
powerful Penn State. In that

match, the Spartan’s drubbed Penn
State by a 32-9 score.

Stottlemyer was able to indicate
further the quality of the Michigan
State wrestlers by pointing out the
fine Nittany Lion grapplers the
Spartans had defeated.

“Even though I haven’t seen

some of their [Michigan State’s] -

young wrestlers, like Steve Foley, I
know they’re good by the Penn

State wrestlers they beat,” said
Stottlemyer. “He [Foley] beat
State’s I-Ianrahan, so I know he's
tough.”

Pitt's 167-pounder Wayne
Lawrence will try his luck at Foley.

. The main point that Stottlemyer
seemedto stressed was that the Pan-
thers were now entering a crucial

Members of Pitt’s men's track

  wilitravel to Cleveland this
; weekend for the Knights of Colum-
' ‘_« bus Games.

Gary Siriano, coming off an im-
pressive showing at Princeton last
weekend, will be joined by team-
mates Larry Shippen, Bud Cooper,
AlCo1es and Dwayne Defoor of the
mile relay team at the Cleveland
meet.

Last week, Siriano placed fourth
in the 3000-meter run with a time of
88:16. Triple jumper Larry Kinney
placed second at Princeton with a
leap of 49 feet, 8 inches.

“Larry’s jump was very com-

petitive "considering those he
jumped against,” said Panther

head coach. Mike Agostinella. " ‘I 
was quite pleased with Gary"s time ~‘ _ V ,_
. Goff. “Every’meet hasbeena‘ big

also‘. Héfwas competing in‘ the,"
championship! division and it was
his best time ever.”

Agostinella said the team's
overall condition has improved.
Some of the athletes who had been
sidelined by the flu are now healthy
again, according to the coach.

Meanwhile, Gwen Murray will be
the lone Pantherette trackster active
this weekend as she also travels to
Cleveland to enter the 400-meter
run. At last week's Pitt Invita-
tional, Murrayiwas a member of the

meet. The girls haven’t been able to
relax.” '

Goff indicated that a coach can
never be totally satisﬁed and that
there were some things the team
could have done better this year.

“There were some pleasant sur-
prises with some of theathletes,”
said Goff. “The girls still have
regionals to look forward to and
can also hope to go on to nationals
from there.”

For those not participating in the
regionals, the outdoor track season

begins at the end of March.

“We have to look forward to the
outdoor season mainly because we
are Iijostingtlie outdoor Eastern
Regio“n‘aI‘s,;-f’ -said Goff. “The girls
can perforrnin front of their own
families and friends right here in

“This is the time of the year

noted the Pitt head coach.
“You’ve got to watch so you don’t

going through the motions. You
have to remember, the EWL’s

  Swim Team Ca

By CHRISTY ELSTON

3:

Pitt News Staff Writer

Captain. What does the word

4 bring to mind? Most people think

of an individual picked by team-
mates to be their leader.

In the case of the Pitt swimming
team, being a captain, as are Sue
Guyer, Sue_ Dowd and Cindy Fer-
raro, means being an individual
with high achievements in swimm-
ing and diving, one with ability to
lead a group of athletes through
w‘nning and losing, to keep at-

?iikudes high and to give guidance to
those in need. — ,

The mostimportant quality these
three women possess is their ability
to motivate and inﬂuence their
teammates. Tonight, the three cap-
tains will participate in the last dual
meet as seniors for the university.

Sue Guyer, or “Cricket” as her
teammates call her, because of her

enthusiasm and her long legged ’

build,’ learned to swim when she
was 12. .
“My, younger sister almost
drowned and my parents thought it
was important to be able to stay

YMCA and she was awarded one of
the 60 sports allocated for the team.

“My name was the last to be call— 4

ed, she said. ‘It meant a big boost
for my swimming career.”
She worked hard to become one

of the best, and was the only com- —

petitor in her age group (11 and 12)
to compete in state championships.
At Central High School in Roaring
Springs Pa.,, there was no team for
her to compete with, so she and a
few others swam on their own.

Guyer started to swim AAU
when she was a junior and that is
also when she started to swim for
Pitt on their Pitt Aquatic club.

Coach Bradshaw came up to me
and ’my parents at a summer meet
and said he would ,like me to swim
on his AAU team, she said. “I
came to Pitt’ that summer and
stayed with a friend.”

She went undefeated that sum-
mer in the breaststroke.

Guyer said she loved Pitt’s
facilities and the rewarding swim-

iming /she had done under Coach

Bradshaw, so Pitt was her obvious
choice for college. ,
Since Guyer has come to Pitt, she

workers, said Coach Dick Brad-

shaw.” She always gives her all.”
Dowd learned to swim at age

seven at a summer club. From

‘there, she swam on the YMCA

team, where she started to win a lot
of her events. She swam for Merion
Mercy Academy, a Catholic girl's
schoolduring high school for three
days a week. One big change since
she cam to Pitt is that she now
swims twice a day, three times a
week, and every night according to
Guyer.

She said she came to swim for’

Pitt partly because she ‘had a

brother on the team and because

she liked the facilities.

‘ Last.but not least is Pitt’s diving
captain of two years, Cindy Fer-
raro. _

“Cindy is probably one of the
most congenial women on the
team” said Julian Krug, her coach.
“It’s a rare day when Cindy is not
pepping everyone up”.
‘moods tend to stick to the others

and I count on her for being a .

. leader as well as a top performer.”

Ferraro did not start her athletic
career with diving, but as a tram-
polinist at her parent_’s gymnastic
school -in Boston. As a trampoline
contestant, she was second in the
national competition for her age
group. She participated ‘in gym-

Her good.

nastics her freshman and

sophomore years of high school,

where she placed at the state meets.

While in the eighth grade, she
toured the mideastern states with
Mills Brothers Circus.

“Maybe that is where Cindy got
all her entertaining personality,”
Bradshaw said.

She began to dive in her junior
year in high school with the Har-
vard AAU club. She was a‘ two-

time all-America for those
years. .
Ferraro said she came to

' Pitt primarily because of A1 Coffee,

her coach for three years at the
university.

Panther Spikers Fourth at Ohio State

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt men's volleyball team
spent a very disheartening weekend
in Columbus at the Ohio State In-
vitational, competing against some
of the best Midwestern squads. Pitt
finished in third place in their pool
of four teams as they faced Wiscon-
sin, Cincinnati, and powerhouse

Head coach Ray Reilly and assis-

tant Mike Hebert looked at the .

team’s performance as stemming
from a bad mental game. -

“I think that we must look at the
gangbuster of a start that the guys
had,”’said Reilly. “They got off to
such a good start that they got a
little overconﬁdent—that made for
some bad mental games at Ohio

better performances of the day.
The third match of the day

brought the first Panther victories .

of the invitational. Pitt came out
on top by 15-12 and 15-6_scores,
before being defeated by a close
13-15 score. According to Reilly,
the squad seemed to pull together in
this contest and play more like the
Pitt squad of the past few weeks.
