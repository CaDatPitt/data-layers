includes a pep rally.

Bubbles Field is located behind V
the left field section of Forbes Field,
one block from the Hillman Library.

The Bob Hope show will begin at
8:30 p.m. in the Field House tomor-
row. Tickets will remain on sale at

U. S. Senator Hugh Scott (Pa.. Hep.) proposed a voluntary draft I

system in his speech Monday in the SU Ballroom. -His brief talk on
politics in America was followed by a question-answer session.

“The draft wastes both men and money." contends Sen. Scott.
“There is a 90 percent turnover of draftees each year. an almost total

manpower loss. After a new draftee is trained". at a minimum cost of

$6.000. he serves for a short time and returns to civilian life. His ex-
pensively acquired skills are lost forever to the service and a new man

must be trained to take his place.

“I believe that new Republican
leadership will put us once again
on the road to peace,” added
Scott, a supporter of Presidential
candidate Richard M. Nixon. We
can then phase out the draft sys-
tem and substitute an all volun-
teer service with pay and promo-
tion incentives which more effi-
ciently and more fairly meet our
future needs.” '

One student questioned. “Would
nit a voluntary draft_,sys,tem be

non-responsive“?" Scotffresponded, .
‘-‘Both;thefyevolutionary ;_,War and-_

 
 

fought by volunteers: these wars
were certainly not non-responsive
things. What we need is trained
leadership and trained categories.
backed up by a large force of
reserves. In other words. I don’t
think the volunteers will be jan-
issaries."

Questioned about the need for
universal training. Sen.Scott an-
swered. ‘.‘I used to think this was
necessary during'World War II.
but ‘now I feel it would be a vast
wa‘st_e. since it is impossible to
ca it Ye’riszbo vi". ’ '

A peaceful
morning at Forbes Field against
the credit status of IIOTC by a
group of about 30 members of a
faculty-student group was marred
by an incident involving a U.S.-
Army sergeant and a student.

Sgt. Benedict Boswick grabbed
Tom McKenzie sophomore socio-
logy major, “and started cutting
the buttons off my coat with a
knife.” McKenzie said. I

Sgt. Boswick claimed it was
illegal to wear an Army surplus
jacket brandishing the official
U.S. Army buttons. Sgt. Boswick
cut off four buttons. “I had the
impression,” said McKenzie, “he
was going to run me in.”

{The man at the Army surplus
store assured me that it was okay
to wear the jacket as it was,”
McKenzie added.

Features Mathieu

Industry and art are allied in a
unique relationship in a set of
travel posters created for Air
France by the Parisian artist
Georges Mathieu. Beginning to-
day. the exhibit. sponsored by
COTA. will be displayed in SU
art gallery until Nov. 3.

Air France; in commissioning
Mathieu. gave him a free hand in
designing the works. As a result.
the posters are essentially artistic
rather than commerical. They pro-
fit -from the dynamic techniques
of a contemporary artist whose
works are on exhibit in 48 of the
world’s leading museums.

Each poster is the result of mul-
tiple desings superimposed to
achieve the ultimate work. In ac-
cordance with the artist’s direc-
tives, special papers were pro-
duced and special inks prepared
to achieve color effects corres-
ponding to his vision. Photographs
are incorporated into the desing,
and new techniques of photoen-
graving were developed to create
the_effects intended by the artist.

, Georges Mathieu was born in
1921 and completed studies in lit-
erature and philosophy before
turning to painting in 1942. The
first Frenchman to react vigorous-
ly against the forms of geometric-
al abstract painting. he champion-
ed the cause for an art liberated
from all classical conventions and
restraints which he called “lyric-
al abstraction” or “Tachism.”

His paintings aroused immedi-
ate interest, and since 1950,,Ma-
thieu’s workhas been exhibited
in the United Sates, Japan. South
America. Lebanon, Israel and al-
most every country in Europe. In
1963. the Musee d’Art Moderne
in Paris organized a retrospective
exhibition of 25 of his works, a
distinction rarely accorded a
painter in his own lifetime.

“The experiences of a "Peace
Corps Volunteer abroad can help
him, as an individual, deal with
the situations at home,” says vol-
unteer Patrick Hare. Hare and

several other members of the Peace

Corps will be on campus all this
week.

Hare has just returned from Hon-
duras after a two—year assignment
and will be returning there for a
third year. He mentioned that as
a Peace Corps Volunteer, he learn-
ed “to deal with situations with
no clear right or wrong.” He
reflected that before he went
to Honduras most issues seemed
clear in the United States where-
as in Central America there is
more than two sides to every
story.

Hare pointed out that “the
apathy in American colleges can-
not be compared to the apathy
of the people in Central America.
The techniques used to organize
these people are applicable in
the United States. This‘ is true
even though you may be organi-
zing for different objectives or
improving the quality of existing
organizations.” ~

will be in CL all this week from

8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the Com-
mons l'~l.oom. A film will be shown
Monday and Tuesday from 3 to

 , Dick Gregory’s quest for the Presi-
V" dency may have been doomed from its
;'conception but it is ‘clear that he is not
 motivated by the power and implica-
', tions of office. Gregory’s only motiva-
 tion is his conscience.

g “This is the most morally polluted,
: ‘insane country in the world today,” the
 comedian told his audience last week.
v“‘You will have to solve the problems
-that are about to destroy our country
jftoday, and problems you had nothing
:-to do with,” he continued in a depar-
;' ture from the usual Gregory.

_ It is virtually impossible for Greg-
~ ory to win any of the five states which
jﬁcarry his name on the ballot, but he
has captured the imagination of many
=f_:young people and the attention of many
‘liberals and disheartened McCarthyites
--who were deserted in Chicago.

1 GREGORY IS BITTER._His country
has “programmed” him to believe that
“Black men are “invisible” in the same
sense that Ralph Ellis tells it in The In-
gvisible Man. ; 5

 Dick Gregory is no longer the funny-
.’man found circulating on the night club
circuit; making light of the black man’s
‘burden to a stuffy, do-nothing white au-
jdience. He is no longer at “the back of the
bus” where the bulk of his listeners and
{readers would like him to "stay. "Now he is

tions and “the cause.”

*_He is wise, compromising to his audi-
‘ence and hitting with mentally crippling
humor when he barks into his microphone;
“There are no demonstrators present when
_he speaks. No hecklers . . . they’re all lis-
Itening.

HIS APPROACH is refreshing, in the
L"-light of - the mundane political system
‘which is hamstrung in its own mechanics.
He can cut through an issue with thought-
ful perception and pinpoint the issue with
:'striking clarity.

bring our boys home from Vietnam,” he
says, “and they won’t give a damn. But if
‘iyyou’ don’t buy cigarettes the manufac-
turers will bring them home.”

 Someone once said, “You can’t fight

you are you will agree that city hall bet-
ter end this war. Some are literally fight-

 The Invisible Funnyman

Washington, Chicago. Others, such as
Gregory, are bringing fresh ideas and a
fresh dialogue to the people fortheir own

- consideration. The fact is that in one way

or’ another most people are beginning to
think about the issues, their ramifications
and their implications. Hopefully this
mood will be expressed Nov. 5 at the bal-
lot box instead of on the streets of Home-
town, USA. I

GREGORY CITRS changes as the key
to a better America. A change from the old
way of doing nothing to the right way of
doing something. He doesn’t want to see
violence become _ the prime motive to
change but he hints that it may be neces-
sary as the only alternative for any large
minority to achieve its goal when the es-
tablished majority refuses to acknowledge
the needs and aspirations of the oppressed.

For the first time since the founding
of the United States the government no
longer is responsive to the people. The
electoral college -for example was estab-
lished specifically to_ keep the election of
the President and Vice President from the
people. ‘

 

The founding fathers felt that the peo-
ple could not properly decide ‘their fate.
The electoral college has not seriously
been challenged until today. It ‘has al-
ways been that only two parties should
represent the people and that they would
be compromising and receptive to the
moods of the people. It is this system that
has kept third, fourth and x number of par-
ties out of the running because an effec-
tive electoral challenge was economiacal-

ly prohibitive; the prize was limited to a

house or seante seat or a local office. The
electoral. winner take all system with other
party restrictions, has kept the presidency
for the two major parties. '

But today when the issues are rapidly
changing and the needs of the people go
unmet from Washington, frustration an-
swers for solutions and discontent arises
to fill the void.

GREGORY WANTS to meet this chal-
lenge by cutting through the red tape and
the confusion to meet theproblems when
they arise and to solve them before they
erupt into violence.

But the electoral college. among other
mechanics. ahas restricted his campaign
to a meager electoral effort

But how can a man like Gregory cut
through the ignorance and fear among his
fellow Americans? How can any thought-
ful man strike out at the lack of concern;
at those who are silent, those who do not
care?‘How can any man propose a drama-
tic change and succeed when his country-
men,don’t want change?

How can any man, no matter how de-
termined, solve a problem or confront an
issue before it erupts into catastrophe?

Our system. out people seem to lack
the foresight and the will to challenge;
until that which is challenged threatens
the wellbeing and property rights of those
in power and those with influence.

If that be the case a man like Gregory‘

is doomed.

_ IF.THIS SYSTEM remains unrespon-
sive; if it remains the snail that it is, vio-
lence won’t be just an alternative. It will
be the answer.

If men like Gregory continue to be
doomed, even before they begin cam-
paigns of enlightenment and creative con-
struction, then their disciples will lead
campaigns of destruction.

Dick Gregory is but one of those men.
His followers are anxious for the day when
they can trust the white man. They are an-
xious for the day when a responsive gov-
ernment is the norm and not the excep-
tion.

BUT WILL THEY be as tolerant as
Gregory? Will they be as dedicated to un-
derstanding? Will they be as courageous
as Gregory?

The only unfortunate characteristic of
Gregory’s audience is that they cannot an-
swer yes to these questions.

The major implication of Gregory’s
candidacy is that Americans, both black
and white, need to reorganize their think-
ing to respecteone another. That thought‘
and freedom‘ of expression must be re-
pected with as much animosity that chal-
lenges today’s evils. Unless that is achiev-
ed. the last chapter in The Rise and Fall
of the American Empire may be written
in the streets.

‘Lack Of Content’ Fills

Student Power Movement

Editor. The Pitt News:

The current flurry of student meetings. conferences. state-
ments and editorials centered around “Student Power" has im-
pressed me with its lack of content. It would seem that Student
Power in the abstract has become the goal; the aims of that pow-
er seem decidedly secondary. The Black Action Society made
no such mistake. Knowing that their case for compensatory.ac-

tion was a strong one. they
picked their issues carefully
and moved toward their goals.
Any power which accrued to
BAS was properly secondary
to those goals.

A regrettable feature of pow-
er as an abstract goal is that first
the language and then the actions
become progressively hostile. rev-
olutionary and finally violent.
Proposals for specific action are
replaced by demands for student
rights to control. probing dialo-
gue is replaced by strident pub-
licity. It is my experience that
students at Pitt already have far
more power than they have yet
sought to exert

When a group of students has
emerged ready to work and spend
time on a subject. progress has re-
sulted The pass—fail option is one
example. the joint student-facul-
ty-administration committee on
the Book Center is another. and
student representatives on several
faculty committees is yet another

Classified

I look for evidence of an op-
pressive or indifferent academic
establishment at Pitt. and I don‘t
find it. When student ideas that
are creative. well thought out and
persistently pursued have been
ignored or repressed — it is then
that students can reasonably. have
an inherent power in a viable uni-
versity community. What is more
important. such ideas represent
specific goals that are far more
constructive than a petulant and
vaguely threatening demand for
Student Power

Students for a Democratic Society, one of the
newest student action organizations at the Univer-
sity, has defined its purpose as an attempt to in-
crease deomocracy in all phases of American so-
ciety. SDS maintains that all levels of people should
have the control of the decisions which affect them
and also control the resources on which they are
dependent. - ‘

The new organization is co-ed and membership
is open to all who support democracy as a means to
achieving a social goal. SDS differentiates itself
from being a liberal organization by stressing its
belief that the problems of society cannot be solved
within the present political institutions. Basically
an association of young people of the left, SDS seeks
to create a community of educational and political
concern that will unite liberals, activists, radicals

and scholars. Both students and faculty who wish

to promote a more democratic society, are urged to
participate in the organization.

Students for a Democratic Society plans to sup-
port black students in their demands for increased
enrollment and black history courses. The organiza-
tion believes that only the control of black com-
munities by black people can eliminate racism.

Military recruitment and ROTC on campus will '

be opposed by the group on the grounds that the
University uses these activities to support the gov-
ernment and the war in Vietnam.

Radical transformation of society as a whole is
the goal of SDS since it believes that the problems
of society can only be solved by this method.

Ladyland Shows Hendrix At His Best, Worst

by JOE ANDERSON
Staff Entertainment Editor

Jimi Hendrix took ‘a trip. At
least that’s what his latest album
would have us believe. It was to
Electric Ladyland l(2l'?S 6307)
and like. his last trip. the itiner-
ary (and accompanying home
movies) leaves as much to be de-
sired as to be enjoyed. The bad
part is that Hendrix considers
himself to have a really deep.
brooding personality; the meaning
and significance of which he
tries to portray through his lyrics.
Needless to say he fails miser-
ably. What comes forth from the
pen of Mighty Jimi is completely
incongruous when placed in»
context with Hendrix the musi-
cian. The saving grace of Jimi
Hendrix and. Electric Ladyland

is that one can turn off to his ly-
rics and still experience the force
and drive of his music.

Electric Ladyland is then bas-
ically a dance album or a music-
to—read-the news-paper by al-
bum. It’s a two record deal, so
the listener has plenty of time in
which to get anything done that
he might wish to do. It’s not that
I’m completely against the al-
bum. It’s just that I miss the
Hendrix of Are You Experienced
days. He’s here somewhere if you
just want to take the time to look-
the best place to begin the search
is with “Voodoo Chile,” the last
song on side A.

The beginning of “Voodoo Chile”
reminds me very strongly of
“Spoonful” by Wille Dixon.
It has that hard blues sound which
made the Are You Experienced
album so appealing. There’s even
a very heavy rift in the middle
which features some fine blues
runs and all by Jimi. Behind the
Experience on this particular
selection is Steve Winwood of the
Traffic who plays the organ like
Al Kooper used to when he was
with the Blues Project. At one
point towards the end of the
piece, Winwood starts going off
on a "tangent, a completely dif-
ferent thing than what’s going on
around him, but he is quickly cal-

“led back by Hendrix’s playing.

Too Bad. It would have "been in-
teresting to see where things would
have gone from there. “Voodoo
Chile” just about exhausts the val-
ue of Side A, and so in our search
for the Hendrix of old we are for-
ced to turn from such monstro-
sities as “And the Gods. Made

Love” to the more interesting

“Little Miss Strange.”

“Little Miss Strange” is a
song about one of those enig-
matic girls who keep croping up
in rock music. One never knows

exactly what to make of her ex-
cept that she is apparently very
hard to find. This song was
written by Noel lledding (2nd
guitar of the Experience) and
extablishes Bedding as a talented
composer. “Little Miss Strange”
is the perfect song for the Hen-
drix thing — forceful, dynamic
and primitively rhythmical.

It is not impossible nor unusual
for a highly competent musician
like Hendrix to _ occasionally
butcher an old favorite, but what
Jimi Hendrix does to “Come On”
is really inexcusable. The song
starts out all right, much like
the original version, but the inter-
lude between verses completely
destroys the whole feeling of the
song. Hendrix turns it into a
bouncing, psychedelic feast
when what" is required is just a
strict hard rock arrangement.
This disaster is soon made up
for in the following two pieces
“Gypsy Eyes” and “Burning of-the
Midnight Lamp.”-

“Gypsyi Eyes” has a really
fine. arrangement. Noel 1'-ledding

provides the basic rhythmy, and
durmmer Mitchell supplies the
"pulse while Hendrix fills in at will.
Then i_n the chorus. lledding and
Mitchell cut out. and Jimi sings-
the melody while his guitar fol-
lows monophonically the vocal
(an old blues technique). It comes
across in much the same way the
Cream did on “l'%ollin’ and Tum-
blin”’. Following this is “Burn-
ing of the Midnight Lamp” which
has the best wah—wah guitar ef-
fect I have heard in a song time.
The wah-wah effect can be a
very startling and expressive
experience, but few groups use
it as anything but a torture
device. If you can just turn off
to the lyrics in this piece and leave
the ‘music happen, you’ll be well
rewarded.

“Rainy Day, Dream Away” has
a jazz, roll over, good time sec-
tion in the beginning which works
well, especially the contributions
of the studio musicians. If there
is one thing Jimi is especially
good at besides playing, it’s writ-

'ing the slow, love-is-a-mystery

song. I particularly enjoyed
“May This Be Love” and “The
Wind Cries Mary” from the Are
You Experience album and “Span-
ish Castle Magic” from Bold As
Love. t On the Electric Ladyland
album the song of this type is
“1983 (A Merman I Should Be)”
and it has a rather longimpress-
ionistic interlude with a mystical
flute which constantly fades and
then returns. The return to the be-’
ginning motive is well timed so
that the song never loses its con-
tinuity. -

We are now at the last side which _ 6

opens with “Still Raining, Still

Dreaming,” another fine song
which shows how effective the
wah-wah guitar can be when
used properly. The following.
song,_“House Burning Down,” is

a typical “blah,” “doesn’t —vo'e— ‘$-

me Hendrix song. The only in-
teresting moment here is the harsh,
nerve—twisting guitar section. The- '
next to the last song, “All'Along ’
The Watchtower,” is unequivocal-
ly the best Hendrix has ever done.
Everything is perfect. So often

when someone attempts a Dylan 7

song he becomes caught up in
the music and its presentation
rather than with the true mean} .
ing of exactly what’s happening
in the minds of both Dylan and
the listener. Henrix’s arrange-
ment has captured the myster-
ious, reticent aspect of “All A-
ong The Watchtower” and there-
fore remains true to ' Dylan’s
original intent._ Hendrix has
never before, used .his guitar so

. artistically. It has become more

than just a means of accompan-
iment. It has become the main
spokesman of the song itself.

So that’s Electric Ladyland. In;

the album has many good moment;
If Hendrix would shed his ra-ffish
philosopher—poet garb, he could
become .a lasting influence on the
rock scene. Hendrix lacks the abil-

ity to write really powerfu1§7lyrics;, ,
or else he just doesn’t take, the “

Sex Distinctions Decline   

The University’s Sex and Sex-

speech “The Demise of Sexual
Differences.” The speakers were
Drs. Sandy and Dyarl Bem. psy-
chology professors from Carnegie-
Mellon University, who alter-
nated the speaking to give both
sexes equal time.

Many of our society’s rigid
distinctions between the male
role and the female role are be-

contended. Sexambiguous first

Colognes for men have become big

More fundamental changes in
attitude are evident in differences
between the generations. The
Bems believe that the old-style
stereotypes of how a man or a wo-
man should be can set up a barrier
to the openness. honesty. and self-
awareness which today’s young
people seek in personal relation-
ships. The double standard is weak
er now. In general. young girls
today value virginity at marriage
considerably less than their
mothers do.

Some older people accuse the
new morality of dehumanizing
sex, promoting promiscuity, and
abandoning morale codes. Yet
a less hypocritical approach to
sex is more likely to humanize it,
according to the Bems. They feel
that promiscuity is less frequent
now than in the recent past, and
that more relationships are last-
ing ones. Prostitutes complain
of a shortage of customers under
thirty.

The moral emphasis on sex re-
lationships is changing from the
marital to the personal aspect, as
when, in The Graduate Dustin
Hoffman arrrives "at his girl’s
wedding after it is over. Of course,
he runs off with her, anyway.
Their relationship is based on what
they are to each other, rather than
on the social formality of mar-
riage.

The Bems stated that in spite
of these changes, some artificial
distinctions between the sexes still
remain to be challenged. Some
of the psychological differences
between men and women, such as
male physical aggressiveness,
are probably part of the biologi-
cal nature of the sexes. But. ac-
cording to these psychologists.
boys and girls behave and think

differently. Boys are encouraged

allowed to be more aggressive

boys of the same age think that
school is “feminine.”

This situation reverses with the
approach of high school, and the
increased emphasis on college
entrance and vocational achie-
vement for boys. Girls may be
at an academic disadvantage if
they -lack the aggressiveness to

“Are women still niggers?”
Dr. Sandy Bem stated that “males
and females continue to cling un-
consciously of the idea of woman's
natural role” as mother and house-
wife. She compared this view of
women to the View that black peo-
ple are only good for manual la
bor. In the Soviet Union, she point
ed out; a high percentage of physi-
cians and engineers are women;
the ‘ difference is cultural condi
tioning, not female hormones.

According to Dr. Daryl Bem,
men have the freedom to find a
fulfilling -career in today’s tech-
nological society, but a man’s po-
tential forliving may be narrow-
ed too, as longas sensitivity is
considered effeminate and "dis-
couraged in boys. '

The Bems concluded by sug-
gesting a “roommate” - style, di-
vision ofi labor for an equali-
tarian marriage. and by asking
how manymarriages could claim
to be genuine friendships as

Panel Vie-W5 Panel On Relationships

Early Sex
Difficulties A

Discussion of the problem of pre-
marital sex has long been tabooed
by society. This tradition was
shattered Saturday by the panel
discussion entitled “To Bed or
Not to Bed.”

' “Well, whatif. . .. <7” '

The four member panel presen-
ted their observations and opinions.
Dr. Edward’ Hornick, psychiat-
rist; Dr. Geneva Markus, psy-
chologist; and lleverend Ernest
Pipes were the guest speakers.
Moderator for the panel was Dr.
l.’onald Chez. obstetrician and
gynecologist. Each member of
the panel offered comments bas-
ed on his professional knowledge,
which combined_ with the varian-
ces in their personalities to pro-
vide diverse viewpoints for the
audience to consider.

Dr. Hornick stressed the idea
that certain factors are prere-
quisites for sexual intercourse.
Maturity, commitment, and re-
lationship are the three that he
contends are most important.

Sex from the woman’s point of

—.view was discussed by Dr. Mar-

kus. She feels that the female is
now taking the lead in sexual
activity.

i’everend Pipes considered pre-
marital relationships_ in terms of
frequency of activity. He discus-
sed the “good time girls,” “no
time girls” and “long time girls.”
“Good times” refers to girls who
engage in premarital sex only
for pleasure. “Long time” des-
cribes the lengthy one-girl-one
boy relationship. “No time” is
essentally referring to virgins and
technical virgins.

The questionof premarital sex
as a prerequisite to marriage in
determining the compatibility
of people was discussed in detail.
It was generally agreed among the
panelists that premarital relations
are not necessary for this purpose.
Concerning the same subject,
the statement was_ made ;by- a
member of the panel that “Tw

1-7.

“Interpersonal' Relations” was
the topic for discussion-as part
of the Sex and Sexuality Forum
Friday night. Drs. Edward J.
Hornick, Joshua S. Golden, and

Clark Vincent cited reasons for

the importance of sex and sexu-
ality today. '

Dr. Vincent, director of the Be-
havioral Sciences Center at the
Bowman Gray School of Medicine,
Winston-Salem, North Carolina,
contends that the widegulf be-
tween the state and the individual
hascreated a “search for identi-
ty, part of which is the interest
in human sexuality.”

Dr. Hornick from the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in
Bronx, New York, cited as evi-
dence of the lack of openness of
sexual discussion the story of the
nine year—old boy who wanted
10 know where babies came from
so he could write it in his diary.
“His great grandmother told him
that they came from stumps. He
asked his grandfather and was
told they came in black bags.
Finally he asked his mother and
was told babies came from hos-

pitals. And so he wrote- in his diary,”

the doctor quipped, “that ‘I can
only conclude that there has been
no sexual intercourse in my fam-
ily for four generations’ It is an er-
ror for our generation to tell your
generation about sex,” stated
Hornick.

Dr. Golden, of the School of
Medicine, University of Cali-

fornia at Los Angeles, said, “I
don’t really have the foggiest
notion of what love is. It is too
abstract to be defined.”

‘Response’ Panel Talks

In the panel on Human Sexual
Responses, Saturday afternoon,
Dr. Ponald Chez, Dr. Josua S.
Golden and Dr. Douglass Thom-
pson discussed the similarities
and differences in both the bio-
logical and psychosexual re-
sponses of the male and female.

“Knowing what to expect about
sex can be an enormous relief,”
said Dr. Golden, as the panel pro-
ceeded to correct some common
misconceptions about responses
in the male and the female.

“The female is equal in abili-
ty to respond,” said Dr. Chez,
“although the statement that the
female is slower to respond may
or may not be true, depending
ppon -the criterion used.” '

“Although the -pattern of sex-
ual activity-excitement, plateau,
orgasm, and resolution is the same
for both males and females, only
the _male experiences a, refrac-
tory period. The female, on the
other hand, is multi-orgas-
mic,” explained Dr. Chez.

‘ “Other common misconceptions
are that masturbation causes phy-
sical or psychological defects,

  About   Male, Female  

while orgasm promotes health
Both of these are false. said,
Dr. Golden. - .

The second half of the pane’,
was spent on a question and an
swer period. Questions were eith
er submitted on cards or asked-
directly to members of -the...
panel.  

Asked his opinion of marriage
manuals, Dr. Golden answered
“most marriage manuals ‘are,
written in a moralistic tone; only’
certain things are considered per
missible, and this should notbe
the case. Anything done for the.
pleasure of either one or ' both;
partners should be considered
permissible.” ‘  —

Dr. Chez, in answer to the ques_
tion, “Is it all right for the female
to take thelead?’«‘ said, '‘‘Yes
but only if her partner does no
feel that ‘he is being decascula“
ted; if so, she should be more
subtle.

 

“Why not a Playgirl Magazine?
one student questioned. Dr. Che
thereby answered, “If women?
would pay their quarter on the
newsstand, we would.” »

 

Another student asked. l‘.‘In
teaching a child about sex, should
sex be equated with marriage and
love?” Dr. Golden answered "
“Personally, I’d be inclined to
tell it like it is, although it ‘ is’:
your progative as parent, and tea
cher, "to shape the child’s-ideaslin
a certain direction.” ’

In the ten to twelve o’clock ses-
sio,_ Rev. Pipes commented, f‘The=‘
University has a moral commite
tment to provide information-and
the means to birth control-.’_’
When asked to comment on this;
the moderator, ‘Dr. Thompson"
—director of the University Stu.-I‘
dent Health Service, said,
“There are legal barriers to giving
medicine to students under.
twenty one years of - age.” He
added, “As students, the only
thing you can do about this is to‘
see what you can do about chang-

These were the only words

a “In a few minutes, the whole
game just turned around,” ex-
plained Gustine. “I never thought
it would happen. We had finally

game. The offense moved the ball
 well; there weren’t any illegal

12;". For'the Cubs, ,this is the
 -week that is. The frosh grid-
ders are just two days away
from their season opener
against the Little Mountain-
- eers of West Virginia.

 “Practices seem different
" ‘ this week,” admitted fresh-
‘ men football coach Carl Kok-
.or. “The boys have been very
quiet. They've gotten down to
real business.” »

, This week has also been more
j of serious business than fun for
Kokor, who has to arrange his’
~ squad with the best eleven men
- on offense and the best eleven on
,' defense.

“It’s har ,” explained Kokor,
who has a pleasant problem of
depth. “You never know for sure
' about them until you’ve seen
‘ at . them against another team.”

Kokor and his assistants have
had problems weeding out a start-
. ing defensive team from the load
of talent available. '

The three defensive back posi-
tions are presently up for grabs
from among six players: Lloyd
Rodgers, Lou Angelo, Tony Em-
-. bessi, Steve Moyer, Joe DeLisio,

- and Craig Kugler.

,_ Jack Dykes (6’0, 216) appears
; to be set at middle guard, but the
. rest of the defensive line is also
‘ unsettled. Richard Lozier, John
Simpson, Larry Chesla, John Hol-
losy,. and Phil Ott are competing
‘ for the two tackle positions. John
Moss, Jim Wildonger, John Wil-
Viborn, Doug Ginden, and Hank
, Alford are vying for the two de-
C sfensive end slots.

The Cubs’ defense will feature

a stand-up linebacker who plays

think like a quarterback. I didn‘t
have much difficulty. except at
the beginning, getting used to the
new position.”

Gustine made the switch to de-
fense only last week. “I went to
the coach last Sunday and asked
for a chance at defense." explain-
ed Frank, “He said he had also
been thinking about putting me
there and all week I practiced
with the defense."

The defense did an adequate
job on containing Mike McNal-
len, the Navy quarterback, as he
completed only 16 of 30. passes
and the secondary in particular
turned in one of the best jobs to
date. “The rain could have had
something to do with it,” contin-
ued Gustine. “It’s hard to throw a
water-logged ball. But we were"
reacting to the ball in the air and
we were playing as a unit. (Dave)
Dibbley and (Charley) Hall had
real good games.”

In Navy’s fourth quarter come-
back, the Middies r a n several
plays from the shotgun formation.
but Gustine explained that this
didn’t confuse the s e c o n d a r'y.
“Navy was mixed up with it them-
selves. It didn't confuse us. They
just started hitting their passes.
The shotgun didn’t have anything
to do with it,” he added.

‘SOME OF THE key linemen that frosh coach Carl Kokor and varsity

coach Dave Hart are counting on are (left to right): John Moss (6-4,

205), Jim Wildonger (6-2, 200), Dough Ginden (6-3, 215), and Hank

Lou Julien, J Dany Lynn, and

other linebacker positions.

Ex-Coach Misses Pipers

Cazzetta ‘Revisits’ City

by BILL NAAB
Staff Sports Writer

One of the many familiar names at Saturday’s basketball

clinic was Vince Cazzetta. Last year, Cazzetta led the powerful

championship.

ownership, and coach Cazzetta has
quit over a salary squabble. He
now has a job in promotion with
a nationwide shoe company.

“I had hoped that Rubin (the
ex-owner) would sell the team to
Pittsburgh ownership,” Cazzetta
said. Cazzetta indicated that had
the club ‘remained in the city, he
would have stayed as head coach.
In addition, he feels that former
Ohio State and now Olympic star
Bill Hosket would have joined the
Pipers this season. Vince com-
mented, “Hosket liked Pittsburgh.
It was close to his home. As soon
as the team moved to Minnesota,
the chances for Hosket flew out
the window.”

For 1968-69, the Pipers will go
again with practically the same
t e a m that won Pittsburgh t h e
championship last year. This was
a tremendous feat in itself, since-
championships and} winning in
this city are as rare as diamonds.
The Pipers did not sign one draft
choice. “Gabe (Rubin) waited too
long,” said Cazzetta. ’

The outstanding team weakness
of the ABA, according to Cazzet-
ta, is the center position. But, he
also said that the case isn’t much
different in the NBA.. “They only
have about four real good cen-
ters,” Cazzetta added.

  

Cazzetta also said that Rubin,
t h e owner, traded c e n t e r Ira
Harge, “without my knowledge
or consent.” This may have been
a reason for Cazzetta’s quitting.

Cazzetta said that attendance
would have improved had th e
t e a m -stayed. “We in a d e many
friends, and people started to be-
lieve in the Pipers. I wish they
could have stayed. It was too bad
about many things,” said Vince.

Of course, Pittsburgh seems to»
be a city that doesn’t support win- '
ners, only losers.

Ridl Delighted
\Vith Smooth-
Going Clinic

More than 300 people trav-
eled to the Fitzgerald Field
House‘ last Saturday to chew
over and digest the fundamen-

{tal basketball tactics.

Both coach Buzz Ridl and
assistant coach Tim Grgurich
appeared exceptionally pleas-
ed and elated by the good‘ re-
sponse ‘to thebasketball clin-

. ic. Approximately 90 high

school players and 190 high
.school coaches attended the vent
which coach Pidl had been plan-
ning since last July. "

“I think the clinic stimulated
some early basketball interest, and
I believe that those who attended
went away happy,” stated I-lidl.

One of the features of the clin-
ic happened to be the McCall's
Portable Rebounder. Coach Chuck
Gugino of Highlands demonstrat-
ed the importance of the machine.

The rebounder’s primary objec-
tive is to improve jumping condi-
tioning. Ideas can also be impro-
vised to condition leg, arm, and
hand strength. “The rebounder
can be raised as high as the kid
can go. It eliminates the human
element, and the boy must jump
a certain height. It’s not like tim-
ing a jump ball,” remarked Ridl.

He additionally commented that
Canevin coach R 0 n Cygramus
stated many excellent ideas. “His
reaction and conditioning drills,”
Ridl said, “were just great.”

‘Vince Cazzetta, another top
guest, who coached the Pipers and
was voted 1967-68 ABA coach of the
year, demonstrated various defen-
sive tactics. Westinghouse coach
Ed Fleming and Rick Mount’s high
school coach Jim Rosenstihl also
added to the interesting commen-
tary. ’

Determined Jungle Cats Attempt To
Regroup After ‘Heartbreaking’ Loss

    

by ART ROSENGARTEN
Staff Sports Writer
For the fifth time in six weeks, the Pan-
ther gridders are once again trying to regroup
their forces after another loss. Only this loss,

a 17-16 defeat by Navy, was one of the hardest

for Dave Hart and his crew to take.

“The loss was heartbreaking to say the least,”
said a disappointed Hart. “The boys didn’t quit,
and they played hard to the very end.”

“The boys moved the ball very well, and they
came through on the big plays.” continued Hart.
Against Navy, the Panthers were able to put to-
gether drives of 53, 76, and 79 yards and a final one,
_in the last three minutes, of 61 yards which ended
on the Navy five yard line with a missed field goal.

Besides the long drives, the gridders were able
to come up with the big play to keep the drive go-
ing. Once in the first half and -twice during the fin-
al drive, they were able to successfuly make cru-
cial fourth down plays.

In that final drive. Joe’McCain, who was in- V.

jured and wasn’t supposed to see any action, caught
both of quarterback Dave _Have'rn’s fourth down‘
tosses to keep the drive alive. Hart‘ described Mc-

. o o ,

Hart has to get his squad_‘.“p.syched-up”, for another

  

Quarterback Havern continued his fine perform-
ances. Saturday, he completed 14 of 24 passes for
189 yards, with only one interception. Two of those
tosses went for touchdowns. One was a 30-yard
pass and run play to Skip Orszulak, who had six
receptions, and the other was to tight end George
Medich for five yards and a score. Medich had
four receptions in the game.

The ground game also picked up for the Pan-
thers, with sophomore Tony Esposito picking up
112 yards in 25 carries. This was the second time
this season that a Panther ‘back had picked up over
100-yards on the ground. Denny Ferris did it
against William and Mary.

- Fumbles and the inability of the defense to stop
Navy on the big third and sometimes fourth down
plays hurt the Panthers. The gridders fumbled four
times, and lost the ball three of those times.

The one that hurt the most occurred when
Charlie Hall, a defensive back who had only been
put on the punt return team on Friday, fumbled a
Navy punt. and the‘ Middies recovered the ball on
Pitt’s 12-yard line. Five plays later Navy scored and

» took a 6-3 lead into the halftime locker room.

With Homecoming as a hopeful boost. Dave

Boaters’ Lack of Goals,
Likes the Extra Lineman

by ED CONLEY
Staff Sports Writer
Bob Trexler, being the only upperclassman on the soccer
team’s front line, should be in the best position for analyzing
the problems that the squad is having in regard to scoring. But, this

isn't so.

“I don’t understand it.” the junior lineman remarked. “It’s got

nothing to do with the other guys
being sophs. and. certainly. we’ve
all scored before."

Could it be that the early goals
the opposition has been coming
up with have forced the booters
into thinking that they are finish-
ed before they start?

Trexler says, “No! In the-be-
ginning, maybe. But, the quick
goals hurt less every game be-

’ cause the guys are getting tired

oflosing.”

Whatever the reason, coach Leo
Bemis, tried to halt the scoring
jinx last Saturday by switching
from four to five linemen. Trex-
ler likes this idea.

He mentioned, “I kind of like
the five man line. I don’t know
what difference it makes, it

_should bring more pressure into

the offense.”

In that set-up, Trexler has been
playing the center forward posi-

tion, a spot he prefers.

“When you’re inside, you’re
not alone,” he stated. “It seems

that on the outside you have to
depend on someone to getthe ball
to you.”

“The ball is always on the in-.

side. and I like to be where the
ball is,” he continued.

Bemis, however, would like to
see the Topton, Pa., lineman out
on one of the wings. “I started
him at center forward last year,
then moved him to outside right.
He looked good out there,” the
coach related.

“But,” he added, “Trexler com-
bines best with Tsima (Confer-
ence Lekomal on the inside.

“He’s always hustling, he’s
hard, and he’s a good team man.”

Trexler has almost as much en-
thusiasm for the squad as his
coach has praise for him. The
booter feels that the team isn’t
done, yet.

.“Anyone can come back” he
pointed out. “It’s easier to build
up because when you’re4the un-
derdog it’s easier to beat the other

, team.”

He doesn’t think the team’s at-
titude is too different from early
in the season, either. The great
hustle of the kickers in their loss
to Ohio U., last Saturday supports
this thought.

But, even if the team spirit has
changed, the attitude of Bob Trex-
ler hasn’t. He reasoned, “I don’t
go into any game different. You
can’t do better than your best, and
you always try to win. ”

RELIGION AND REll0LllT|0ll

A series of lectures on social and
cultural unrest in contemporary society by

Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein

4":==EE§:!5_,

Biblical Man- and the Pursuit of the Milleniumz
Biblical man was deeply moved by a vision of perfect human felicity
at the beginning and the end of history. The significance of the Biblical
conceptions of the original paradise and the final triumph of God's king-

dam will be discussed. The impact of the biblical vision on contemporary
thought will be analyzed. '

Hegel, Marx and Nietzsche—Twentieth Century Thinkers:

The impact of Hegel's analyses of human encounter, alienation and the
political order on the thinking of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche will
initiate this segment of the series. Particular attention will be given to
Hegel's Early Writings, The Phenomenology and the Philosophy of Right.

Marx's‘ role as social critic and revolutionary visionary will be exam-
ined. His analysis of alienated labor and the dehumanization of the
social and political realms will beevaluated as will Marx's contributions
as a political prophet.

Nietzsche's attempt to reconstruct human values after the loss of faith
will conclude this section.

The Impact of Contemporary Technology
on the Contemporary Sensibility:

a. Medicine and the New Morality: Modern medicine has made it pos-
sible for far more people to survive than ever before in history. Modern
arms technology has made it possible for far more people to be slaugh-
tered efficiently than ever..The pill and the coil have diminished th§_
age-old cohsequences of sexual relations. The impact of contemporary
medicine and biology on morality will be discussed.

b. The Communications Revolution: Marshall McLuhan has pointed to the
influence of the way men communicate on their apprehension of the
world. At no time in history has human communication changed as
rapidly or as drastically as in the electronic age. The impact of electronic
technology on contemporary sensibility will be discussed.

c. Efficiency and Helplessness—Wo|’l< in Contemporary Society: The pro-
liferation of vast, impersonal technological organizations in government,
industry and education has made possible immense advances in human
productivity. It has also changed the conditions of work so that men
no longer feel fulfilled in the segmented, impersonal functions they per-

1' form. The problem of work in modern society will be discussed.

The Collapse of Authority:

In religion, politics and the universities, establishments are in trouble.

_ The collapse'of authority has been’ a revolutionary and unsettling phe-
nomenon, the finalresult of which has yet to be comprehended. The
collapse of authority in America and French politics, the universities and
in both the Christian Church and the synagogue will be discussed.

Herbert Marcuse-—Social Critic and
Contemporary Utopian:

Herbert Marcuse has analysed the dilemmas of human work and sexu-
ality in Eros and Civilization and One-Dimeniional Man. His writings have
5‘ had a profound effect on contemporary thought. They will be analysed

in the lectures.
The Student Revo|t—- '
Berkeley, New York, Paris and Mexico City:

One reflection of the profoundly radical character of our times has been

the world-wide student unrest. The student unrest will be discussed in

terms of contemporary political ideology and the revolution in the con-

temporary sensibility. Particular attention will be devoted to the French
’ student revolt and its aftermath.

Revolution, Human Limitation and

Alternatives to Utopia:

ls it possible to bring about a successful revolution? What are the limi-
tations inhuman nature which mitigate against Utopia? Are there viable
alternatives to revolutionary utopias which do not lose sight of the
nature of mdn as the cruellest and most aggresive of all animals?

All Lectures will be given. on.
