Inter-Fraternity Council Offers ‘S’
Scholarship for European Travel

Award Rib-vides
Chance To Study,
Live in Europe

The ‘S Award for study
abroad during the summer
months is once again being
offered by the fraternity men
at Pitt to one of this schools
most’ deserving third year
students. '

The deadline for applicants
has been set for Nov. 30.
Blanks may be picked up at
Miss_Suter’s desk ingthe office of
the ~Dean of Men on the eighth
floor. All Junior men are eligible
to apply.

, The purpose of the S Award is
five fold as stipulated by Inter

 Fraternity Council. First, to en-

courage widespread student inter-
est in international affairs. Sec-
ond, to give men students the
opportunity of summer study and
travel in Europe. Third, to give
the student body‘ the benefits of
this experience through a series
of talks and articles by the
recipient of -the award.

Fourth, to enable citizens of
other countries to meet and bet-
ter understand the American stu-
dent. And fifth, to express to the
community and the county the
interest which the University of
Pittsburgh is’ taking in interna-
tional affairs.

The criteria for selection of the
awardee, as stated in the S Award
brochure, are as follows:

1.) Character, integrity, and
the ability to met the purposes
of the award shall be foremost in
the consideration.

2.) A minimum quality point
average of 2.0. . '

3.) A ‘candidate shall have

Juniors Take
Record Exam

This Year

Graduate Record Test
Now Required for All
Third Year Students

For the ﬁrst time, College
juniors will be required to
take graduate record exams.
‘Area tests for Graduate Rec-
ord Examinations will be held for
all juniors in The College, Tues-
day and Wednesday, Nov. 9 and
-10, in the Banquet Room of S01-

diers and Sailors Memorial Hall‘

from 12:45 to 5 pm.-

Tests are designed to provide
an appraisal of the college stu-
dent's comprehension in ﬁelds of
social science, humanities, and
natural science.

Since questions will test the
student’s grasp of basic concepts
and his ability to apply them,
rather than his recollection of de-
tails of specific courses, no prepa-
ration for the test will be neces-
sary. «

Results will be used toward an
evaluation of colleges and stu-
dents in the degree of their prep-
aration in these basic ﬁelds.

All juniors are required to be

present for those tests promptly’
at 12:45. Make-up examinations.

‘will be given at the expense of
the student and only in event of
accident’ or illness.

in View of the fact that this is the
second year freshmen have
elected officers.

Class officers in the college dur-
ing the cpming year will be:
president, Harold Shapiro; vice-
president, Virgil Raymond Rlizzo;
secretary, Bernard Sobol; treas-
urer, Ellsworth Bowser; and fifth
man, Fred Grossinger.

Bus. Ad. freshmen elected Arn-
old Landy, president; Edward
Lesser, vice-president; Julian
Fine, secretary; James Heyl,
treasurer; and Irving Horovitz,
fifth man.

First year engineers elected
Daniel O’Connell, president; John
Husher, vice-president; Robert
Wolff, secretary; William Ganon,
treasurer, and Michael Scott, ﬁfth
man. ,

Jack I-lardman, asistant Dean
of Men, said the vote was “good
compared to general school elec-
tions.” He expected greater par-
ticipation, though.

Student leaders were pleased
with the order and common sense
of the freshmen. Names of all
candidates were posted a day in

Dean Russell D. Niles of the
New York University School
of Law has announced that
college seniors throughout the

c o u n t r y may apply for the
school's Root-Tilden scholarships.

The Root-Tilden program is de-
signed to help develop potential
leaders in public affairs. Scholar-
ships are awarded on the basis of

superior academic record, poten-
tial capacity for unselfish public
leadership, and active participa-
tion in extracurricular college life.

Applications for 1955 scholar-
ships must be completed by Feb.
15, and final selections will be
made late in March. College sen-
iors who wish to be considered for
the scholarships should apply to
the Dean of the School of Law,

ter, New York 3. N. Y.

Applicants must be unmarried
male citizens of the United States,
at least 20 years old, but not more
than 28, when the law training
begins. '

Each of the scholarships carries
an annual stipend of $2,200 to
cover tuition, books and living
expenses. Although the award is
made initially for one year, it
may be renewed for the second
and third years if the student
maintains a high standard in legal
and general scholarship.

Underthe terms of the grant,
20 scholarships are awarded an-
nually on a competitive regional

Talks on Thrifty Food Planning

By NANCY JONES _
Married women are allowed at least one night out a
month. Here at Pitt it’s the tenth of every month. That’s
the meeting date for “Pitt Dames,-” an organization made

up (if wives whose husbands

attend the university. Next
, the “Dames” will hold their

third meeting in Stephen Foster Memorial.
Armour Company will show awﬁlm and give a talk on

economical food planning. Usually’

meetings include speakers, dis-
cussions, and socials. Once the

walls of Foster Memorial almost
got a shellacking from the enthu-
siastic women. A demonstration
by Sherwin-Williams Paint Com-
pany on painting designs on walls,
resulted in everyone trying her
hand. However wall paper was
used instead of the Memorial
walls.

Husbands escort their wives to
one meeting. They have an old
fashioned square dance or a cov-
ered dish dinner at this affair.
During the summer the children
had a special program, too. Mrs.
Fletcher Hodges, wife of Foster
Memorial curator, was invited to
tell stories to the children.

Pitt Dames was founded at the
University in the spring of 1950.
Dean of Women Helen P. Rush
and the University Women’s Club,
consisting of wives of faculty
members, were instrumental in its
founding. Pitt Dames is the Pitt
Chapter of the National Associa-
tion of University Dames.

The national organiation has
chapters in many universities
throughout the nation. Headquar-
ters is at Ohio State University.
Tiie “Dames” have their own so-
rority pin. They started off by en-
listing 150 members in 1950.

However this year the club has '

Campus Atom Smasher B

~   5,‘

uried in Hillside

Scaife ‘Laboratory
Houses Cyclotron
To Aid Research

By JUDY GOTTERER

A steel and water insulated
fortress smashing atoms for
human welfare is half-buried
in the campus hillside on O’-
Hara St. facing Bouquet.

This Sarah Mellon Scaife
Radiation Laboratory, housing
one of the largest cyclotrons
in the country, carries on basic
-research in nuclear and solid state
physics as a self-supporting unit
of the University of Pittsburgh.

The cyclotron, an atom
smashing machine, is instru-
mental for synthesizing from
ordinary mater large quantities
of ‘radioactive elements. It
played a leading part in the de-
velopment of atomic energy
and the atom bomb.

Large quantities of radioactive
materials, produced by the cyclo-
tron, may be used in a direct
.manner for therapetuic effect in
treatment of disease.

In small quantities, such mate-
rial can be “tagged” and used in
the body as tracers in the investi-
gation of body processes.

Elements produced by the cy-
clotron have chemical properties
and are radioactive. With a Gei-
ger-Muller counter physicists can
tell exactly when and where the

‘cyclo-chemical enters the body

and can observe the part they
play in the human body in health
as well as in disease.
Diifuses Metals

Applications of the cyclotron
are innumerable. It can tr a c e
calcium direct from fod to bones
or teeth. It can be used in the

treatment of lukernia, in the an-.

alyses of steel, in the determina-
tion of the earth’s age, and in the
measurement of vapor pres ures.

It can diffuse one metal through
another and separate gold, silver,
and platinum mixtures.

The cyclotron has equal appli-
cation in practically all fields of
pure and applied science—biology,
chemistry, physics, metallurgy.

Radioactivity of an atom is a
disintegration deep in the in-
. terior of the atom and not a
surface effect that can be easily
changed. To get at this, radio-

per cent, acording to Dr. Alex-
ander J. Allen, director of Pitt’s
radiation laboratory. '

“The radioactive cyclotron
must be isolated in a small
building for safety reasons,"
said Dr. Allen. To enlarge the
present building would be un-
safe. as well as impractical. All
utilities would have to be in-
creased.”

Although not ready to go into
effect, architectural plans have
been drawn for construction of a
large annex to house research
activities and a physics depart-
ment.

Building Finished in 1941

Original building plans for the
University cyclotron were pro-
posed in 1939 when Dr. Allen was

smash the atom.

In a cyclotron an intense mag-
netic ﬁeld is used to drive ions
in a circular path——,thus the term
“cyclotron.” When ions strike

other atoms,r.~ the disintegration

takes place and radioactive atoms
with new properties are born.
The cyclo chamber is com-
pletely buried in the hillside. A
four-foot wall of water in steel
tanks and two fet of masonry
presents a 40-foot separation be-

‘(tween the chamber and the room
"where the operator gathers cum-

putations from the cyclotron’s
automatic controls.
Warns of Radiation

Special instruments give warn-
ing if the operator becomes sub-
ject to dangerous radiation. Prac-
tically no radioactivity can escape
to harm operators or those in
surrounding buildings.

The rest of the building accom-
odates laboratories, offices, and
auxiliary equipment.

5; The primary purpose of the Pitt

I radiation laboratory, which oper-

ates on a 24-hour schedule, is for
training students in nuclear en-
ergy. More than 90 per :ent of the
80 staff members are students and

way.

In 1941 the initial grant of $50,-
000 was presented to the Univer-
sity’s School of Medicine by Mr.
and Mrs. Alan M. Scaife.

The building was completed in
1941, but the cyclotron was not
installed until 1945. During World
War II the building housed navy
offices.

Rearch grants have been ob-
tained from the Army, Navy,
and the Research Corporation
to carry on fundamental re-
search related to the cyclo-
tron.

“The laboratory is almost com-
pletely self-supporting,” said Dr.
Allen, Westinghouse gr adu ate
professor of engineering and pro-
fessor of physics. “We have sev-
eral government contracts from
which funds are used for research

and to give financial assistance to
students.” _

Automatic Controls Featured

Only occasionally does the Pitt
laboratory make radioactive ma-
terials for it is usually cheaper to
obtain such materials from the
Atomic Energy _Commission in
Oakridge, Tenn. However some
materials, such as radioactive so-
dium, have been made by Pitt for
the Commission.

Pitt’s machine features an oscil-
lator, vacuum tank, accelerating
electrodes, constant current net-
work, and automatic controls.

The instrument itself consists
of three parts——an 85 ton magnet,
a vacuum tight ion chamber, and
an oscillator.

The magnet is located in the
hillside to the rear of the build-
ing. It is covered with over five
feet of earth to absorb any pene-
trating radiation produced in the
cyclotron.

In the center of the frame of
the magnet are two circular mag-
netic poles. Surrounding the poles
are two coils through which more
than 100 amper‘es flow contin-
uously during operation of the
cyclotron.

The ion chamber, an enlarged

‘ pillbox, has its ion source located

in the midle of the chamber.
Cycle Forced

Two electrodes are placed in
the intense magnetic ﬁeld pro-
duced between the poles and the
ions of the ion chamber. They are
forced by a potential difference
of 100,000 volts to complete a cir-
cular path.

Just as they come out of the
cycle, they are given a potential
of an ‘additional 100,000 volts to
draw them back in. This increases

speed to 200,000 volts. Each time
the electrodes go around and come
out of the cycle a boster of 100,-
000 volts is needed.

Ions with this speed come out
of the machine in the form of a
bluish white beam more than
a yard long. This beam will
disentegratelatoms of any mate-
rial placed in its path.

Since it takes one hundred mil-
lionths of a second for the ion to
go from one electrode to another,
the potential of an electrode must
be changed one hundred million
times per second. This speed is
produced by the oscillator.

University departments and
schools participate in cooperative
research with the cyclotron staff.
These include the physics and
biology departments, and the
Engineering and Medical Schools.

Other Agencies Assist

The physics department and
radiation laboratory are separate
from each other but operate as
one unit of the University.

Nuclear research is carried
on with scientific personnel at
Westinghouse Research Labor-
atory, Carnegie Institute of
Technology, Pittsburgh Plate
Glass, and Alcoa.

Future plans include the ex-
tention of nuclear and solid state
physics research and the acquisi-
tion of an atomic reactor.

When you step on an insect, you kill it. When you
step on the accelerator the results may not be so impersonal.
Last year’s fatality record shows 8,200 deaths among
p_ersons of college -age. The total showed 38,300 in all age
groups dead as a result of traffic accidents. The causes of
these deaths are difficult to determine. The dead don’t talk.
But the faults. di.d not.appear to be in the automobiles
themselves. Nor were they apparent in the driver’s_physical

. condition. The majority of college age drivers are in ex-

cellent physical condition, possessing good reﬂexes and
sharp eyesight. Road conditions and the weather are usu-
ally blamedvfor many fatal accidents but the cold fact re-

 jmains that the driver is the motivating source. Without him

the car won’t move. Without him the roads might be a solid
sheet of ice and still no accidents would occur, _
The sole cause for the overwhelming majority of ac-
cidents involving persons of collegeage is the person him-
self. He may be in a hurry for a date, or a class, or nothing

'in‘particular. The latter is usually the case. Or he may

decideto cut across the path of an oncoming truck to make

a a left turn. »

,Many are prone to cut in and out of traffic with scant
regard for cars moving up behind. And there is the omni-
present type who can’t tolerate the sight of another driver
in front of him. I . '

Traﬂicv -lights seem to bring out the racing urge, an

urge which expands with a squeeling roar as the light sig- '

nals caution‘; Stop signs commandno respect whatsoever
from thislbreed. Invariably they will inform you that they

iare..g0od- drivers, backing up this statement with an acci-

dent free record which remains safe due to a monthly brake
relining and tire recapping. Unfortunately this type usu-
ally has —-only one accident on his list.‘ His ﬁrst. And his last.
i I All ofthese various offenders share one stark charac-
teristic. "glaring lack of judgment. A lack which is usu-
ally decreased with age until the person can look back
upon his ﬂaming youth and wonder how he lived through
it. Last year 8,200 didn’t.

Another Change . . .- .

Miners FindS

By Irv Rothman

When President Eisenhower invited Pennsylva-
nia Republicans -to steak dinner at his Gettysburg
address, GOP campaigners were conﬁdent that a
needed personal touch was added to a‘ rugged cam-
paign. But they didn’t count on the fact that
steaks are rare tidbits for keystone state coal
miners.i I .

That important detail, coupled withlast minute
statements by Veep Richard
Nixon and ribald advertisements
by old guard publicity agents

and greater U.S. .prestige fell
flat in light of this nation’s dip-

few months and .“hot-potato” sit-
uations in Korea, rlndo-China
and the Near East. .-

I visited a buddy this summer in the heart of
the anthracite coal area in Central Pennsylvania.
He was lucky because he got a job through-a friend.
But workers throughout the Pottsville-Haizleton-Mt.
Carmel area were putting in one and two days’ a
week in the coal mines. Their wives, working
in the textile .mills, provided subsistence.
stayed home to watch the kids while women brought
home the bread and butter.

Only recently, a government-sponsored project
to investigate further uses of hard coal, was closed
down near the Great Lakes area.
didn’t want to compete with private enterprise.
$90,000,000 Lost '

Voters are still puzzled over the Dixon-Yates
contract under which the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion would buy electric power from two private
utility combines to be delivered to the Tennessee
Valley Authority——at an estimated $90,000,000 more
than if TVA itself provided‘ the power. Again,
private enterprise is enhanced. People wantto know
why? Since the GOP won’t answer, voters ﬁg-

ured Democrats might ﬁnd an answer or straighten
it up.

Adlai Stevenson, Democratic presidential can-
didate in 1952, criticized Republican‘ statements
that peace in‘Europe is an Eisenhower accomplish-
ment. Hs asked, “Who can truthfully say that this
is “peace” when there are 3,500,000 men under
arms and our government spends more for defense
today than we were spending at the height ‘of the
Korean war?”

Stevenson Unfit ,
‘Dick.Nixon doesn’t like adverse, comment and
took issue with he Democratic leader. He even
proved himself a poor winner when he blasted,
“In so attacking the man (Eisenhower) who got
us out of one war,‘ kept us out others . _. ., Mr.
Stevenson proved again that 34,000,000 Democrats,
Republicans, and independents were right when,

they found him unﬁt to be President in. 1952.” 

Voters were not inﬂuenced at this election by
wavy hair or wide smiles. They just weren’t satis-
ﬁed and wanted another change.

But GOPE publicity agents swept to a new low
with a paid advertisement which appeared at ‘elec-

tion time. It pictured a huge graveyard in Korea,

and bore a statement ‘to the effect, “This isihow
the Democrats solved unemployment.” As if any
party has a premium on peaceful intentions!
Controlling forces certainly didn’t rally chickeh
farmers to their side when they referred to
democratic gubernatorialcandidate, George Leader
as a “relatively unknown produceer of peeps from

York County.” Shades of bird-dogs! T

President Eisenhower used ‘a common expres-
sion to vpice his opinion about the campaign,
G.O.P. included. After ’a television broadcast elec-
tion night, he turned to press secretary, James
Hagertyjband said, “sometimes you sure get tired
of all this clack_ety-c1ack.’’ ’

Well from now on the White House door knock-
er will go clackety-‘clack at the hands of Demo.-
cratic leaders who inuence will prevail. That’s, the
way people want it.

Experience Neded

Located on the ,19th and 20th
floors of the Cathedral, the
School’ of Retailing confers mas-
ters in retailing degrees upon
completion of all requirements.

A staﬁ of ten comprise the
faculty and are augmented
throughout "the year by guest
speakers.

Entrance requirements for
the_ School of Retailing include
an AB or BS degree, a 1.5 QPA
in undergraduate work, and
some practical retailing experi-
ence. -

Pitt is one of ‘three univer-
sities in the United States to offer
a masters degree in retailing. The
other schools are New York and
Washington Universities.

New York Trip

Before the final work session,
all retailing students visit a world
market, such as New York. They
spend an entire, week visiting
manufactures, b u y i n g offices,
magazines, and department stores.

This helps the student decide
the phase of retailing he would
like to enter.

A close counseling’ program is
maintained by the School of Re-
tailing: Students are assigned ad-
visors in their field with whom
they may consult at any time.

After graduations, the Pitt
school is considered a contact house
for all former students. A place-
ment service is maintained, and
at any time, former students may
consult it for‘ a job.

Every faculty member on the

School. of Retailing has had
practicaly experience in some
phase of retailing.
, L In addition to the School of Re-
.tai1ing, the 19th floor houses a
research bureau. Annual convo-
cations are held each spring with
businessmen in the field, of retail-
ing.

Casting for “The Great Big Doorstep,” Pitt Players’ second pro-
duction, will be held Monday, Nov. 8, from 2:30 to 6 p.m., 351 C1.
Parts are available for ﬁve male and ﬁve female roles.

“The Great Big Doorstep,” which will be presented Dec. 9, 10
and 11, is the story of a poor woman who eventually gets a dream
home of her own. '

Wild Louisiana bayous provide the setting for Mrs. Crochet’s

tumbledown shack. When she ﬁnds a doorstep ﬂoating in the Missis-X“

reality. ‘

The play offers a variety of characterizations for both men and
women. Five female roles includee
Mrs. Crochet; Topal, a restless but
conﬁdent youth; ‘ Evvie, devilish
little girl; Mrs. Dupre who has a
knack for knowing everything
about everyone; and Mrs. Beau-
mont Crochet, a hot-temepered

Neighboring Foes Last Blocks  

To Unbeaten Harrier Season

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Within the space of three days, Coach Carl Olson’s un-
beaten harriers must dispose of Ohio State’s Buckeyes and
Ohio Wesleyan if they are to ring down the curtain ontheir
second straight unbeaten season and extend their win streak

to 17.
Tomorrow they take on the
Buckeyes at Columbus, then after

resting Sunday, journey to Dela-P

ware, Ohio, to meet Ohio Wes-
leyan Monday. ~

Although his squad will be at
full strength for the first time in
several weeks, Olson looks to-
wards the Ohioexcursion with a
mil-d case of jitters.

“The Buckeyes are loaded and
can give the best of them trouble
on their level four mile course,”
commented Olson, “and theyalso
have a very good runner in Bob
Caldron who  undoubtedly
give us plenty of trouble.”

O'SU’s latest triumph was over 2

Michigan State, a perennial pow-
erhouse in the midwest and IC4A
champs last year by a 27-30 score.
Incidentally, Caldron was the ﬁrst
across the ﬁnish line Inthe Buck-
eye-Spartan meet.

Normally the Wesleyan contest
would be nothing more than a

tuneup for the IC4A’s, but Olson
expects them to be troublesome
due to lack of rest between meets
for his squad. He believes. that
only one day of rest ~will eﬁect
the sharpness of his thinclads, thus
causing the boys to be hard-
pressed in order to come out vic-
torious. .

Drills for the locals this week
were designed to stimulate the
Panthers into helping their team-
mates to" work better as a unit.
Olson wants his boys to follow a
certain pace in hopes of being

able to sweep the ﬁrst four places ’

against the Buckeyes. But should
OSU set the early pace, this would

be impossible, and everythinclad A

would have to.run his own race.
Spirit and determination were
prevalent as the Olsonmen de-
parted for the Buckeye state for
they knew that the remaining two

meets can make or break them,

both season—wise and tournament-
wise.

Glowing Buckeye Chart
Doesn’t Dampen Spirit

By GENE AROMATORIO

It might seem that after pulling the unexpected and-

knocking off one of the top teams in the country, a coach
might begin to worry about a possible letdown for the next

game.

This, however, is the least of Captain Tom Hamilton’s-

Worries as he leads the Panthers into Saturday’s all-important

game with Ohio State’s undefeat—¢

ed Buckeyes, whom Hamilton re-
gards as, “possibly the best team

. in the country.”

In fact some observers felt after
watching the Panthers in prac-
tice at Ellsworth Field that the
gridders were showing even more
enthusiasm for
the B u c k eye
tilt than they
had for West
V i r g i n i a ’ s
Mountaineers.

As I-Ia-milton_
remarked after
practice, “T h e
boys are look-

this game. It's
our big oppor-
tunity.” What
he meant by, “opportunity”, the
veteran mentor did not say, but
perhaps he was thinking of last
weekend’s victory over the Moun-
ties. , ,

The Panther win shoved the
mountainmen from seventh-rank-
ed in the nation to 17th and at
the same time moved the Pittites
from nowhere to 20th nationally.

When it comes to experience playing football, there
probably isn’t anyone on the present Panther squad that
tops Richie McCabe and Ed Bose.

Coincidentally‘ enough, both will get their big chance
to show this learning as starters tomorrow since Captain
Tom Hamilton promoted the duo to the opening. eleven this
week - - - although it was for different reasons. '

McCabe, who has been going to practice with the Pitts-
burgh Steelers each fall for the past eight seasons as their
locker room attendant, has worked himself into the ﬁrst-
string right half with his excellent defensive work. .

Bose, the junior center from Westbury, N. J., who played
for the San Diego Subs while in the Navy, moves into the start-
ing group due to the injury to John Cenci.

The background of both is
certainly one of a lot of football.
McCabe, the Panther’s version of
the Splendid Splinter, has watch-
ed and worked out with some of
the best of the pros and his run-
ning shows it.

ing ground gainers with a 3.7
average while also topping in punt returns. .

He can be remembered also for the thrilling 55-yard pass in-
terception at Northwestern in 1953 that put the Panthers back into
the ball game.

Navy vet Bose has two years of service experience over the
rest. Last autumn, in his ﬁrst year with the Pittites, he played
127 minutes and ended the season as the starting snapper-back.

A sharp tackler, the 25-year-old letterman has not seen much
action to date but will be used extensively tomorrowvwith the hope
that his ‘past learning pays present dividends. '

Although Bose is a junior, this will be his only chance to scrapple
with the Buckeyes. The series, which began in 1929, comes to a close
tomorrow and it is not known when the Pitt-Ohio State battles will
be resumed. It won’t be for the next three or four’ years for sure.

A But whenever it is, McCabe and Bose aren’t waiting around.
They’re going out there tomorrow to prove that famous quote about
“the best teacher.” I ' ’
