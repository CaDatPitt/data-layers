‘INSTINCT FICTION
THINKS DR. SCI-IOEN

Behavior,’ Nearly
Perfect, May Be Termed
Instinct

 

 

Instinct’ in man is pure fiction,
long confused with inte ligence and
education, Professor Max Schoen,
head of the department of psychol-
ogy at Carnegie Tech told members
of the psychology forum Monday.

Professor Schoen contended, that
only behavior which appears perfect
or nearly rfect at first perform-
ance may e termed instinct. Al-
thouglrinsects and lower forms of
animals have such behavior, there is
no evidence of it in man. Thus far,
Dr. Schoen is in agreement with
John B. Watson, noted psychologist,
who contends that since there are

no instincts and that there is no in- .

heritance of talent or temperament.

At a meeting of the forum next
week, Dr. Grover H. Alderman, dean
of the school of education and Pro-
fessor George E. Jones of the psy-
chology department will report on
the meeting of the department of
superintendents of the national edu-
cation association held two weeks
ago at BOSIOY. Attention will be
called especialy to those parts of
the program of the meeting that are
of.interest to psychologists, states
Dr. Jesse H. White, head of the de-
partment of psychology.

senior classes.

sideration of plans for Senior Week,
the University‘ song-book, and the
appointment of a spring elections
committee.

No deﬁnite plans concerning Sen-

pointments of Senior Ball and Senior
Week chairmen. Harry Decker,
Dent. ’28, president of Student Coun-
cil, stated the suggestion that sen-
iors wear caps and gowns to all
affairs during Senior Week is not
binding on the class, but will be
decided by action of Student Council
at its meeting this evening.

chairrnanships were considered at a

le e;. President Smiley, dental

John R. Johnston, graduate mana-
ger of; student activities, decided on
candidates from the entire list for
each position. The names of these
two men will then be submitted to
Student Council for approval to-
ni ht.

he presidents of the senior
classes refused to make further
statements when questioned con-
cerning their 5-OPIIIIOIIS of Senior
Week. They preferred to remain
silent until deﬁnite plans were de-
cided by Student Council and men
selected to the ‘two posts.

DISCUSS BRITISH,
COAL MINE CRISES

Dr. S. K. Ratcliffe Says Strikes
Cause Deep Business
Depression

 

Recent crises in Great Britain re-

sulting from the coal situation were
discussed by Dr. S. K. Ratcliffe, as-
sociate editor of the New States-
man, at Heinz house Monday when
he spoke on “Britain’s Basic Indus-
trial Problem-—Coal.”
\ Dr. Ratcliffe reviewed the coal
situation from the close of the war
up to the present time. He discussed
the various attempts of Lloyd George
and Stanley Baldwin to avert nation-
wide strikes and to end the crises
which arose. He summarized the
present situation, saying that condi-
tions caused by the strike brought
about a “widespread depression that
was deeply saddening to view.”

“The miners are hoping for a turn
for the better. Settlement workers
are doing their best to stop the son
from following the father into the
pit, by teaching lads and young men
different trades and preparing them
for vriable positions,” said Dr. Rat-
cliife.

The lecture was held under the
auspices of -the school of business
administratiori. Francis Tyron, pro-
fessor of economics, presided.

An open forum followed the ad-
dress, during which the audience
asked questions concerning our own
strike which, according to Dr. Rat-

Gown, Fred Wellinger, Bus. Ad. '31,
Salaphoﬂei , and Clark Roughen.

school of business administration,

stitute. Dr. M. R. Gabbert, ‘head of

nar,‘ will preside at both meetings.
The afternoon lecture will be given
at 4 o'clock.

SAY UNION DEFEAT
MEANS REGRESSION

Coal and Iron‘ Police Terrned
‘Gunmen by Speakers at
Liberal Club Meeting

Characterizing coal and iron police
as gunmen, imported from the slums
of eastern cities, and stating that
defeat for coal mining unions meant
going back to conditions as they ex-
isted fifty years ago, William Col-
lins,. representative of the:American
Federation of Labor, and Thomas
Robertson, miner and organizer of
the United Mine Workers, told of
oppression and distress -existing in
the present coal situation at a meet-
in of the Liberal club Friday.

- 'e union men related a different
story from that told members of the
club V by R. Templeton -. Smith, general
manager of the Ontario 1Gas Coal
company,-at a meeting of ‘the club
last week. Smith defended the ac-
tions of Pittsburgh operators in the
present. controversy, arguing that
overproduction in‘ the industry had
led. to the situation. -

‘‘Th‘e.Federation of Labor contends
tlia't'since the war there has been or-
ganized conspiracy on the part of big
business to destroy high living.s‘tand-
arda that re uired a period o thirty-
five. years or labor to build up,”
Collins; who has been in this region
for six‘ months, said. Collins asked
for’ the tsympathy of-' the‘public as
regards the coal questi,on.~ “The-
American Federation of Labor,” he
said, _“is sulfering from the lack of
sympathy on the art of the public,
which really shou d be the most in-
terested party.” - ~

Robertson, who was formerly‘ a
miner and who later became an or-
ganizer for the United Mine Work-
ers, told of ~ the beneﬁts which the
organization had securedminers in
the thirty-seven years of its exist-
ence. During this -time, he pointed
out, there had been'_seve_nt:een_. wage
inér“ease's and a reduction in working.
time from sixteen to eight hours.
Through its work, the organization
has caused the passage of numerous
safety, sanitation and compensation
laws. Reviewing the present strug-

"le between miners -and operators,

obertson declared that “not even
one per cent of the miners have de-
serted the unions; We are .not asking
for an abnormal wage; we want only
the j wage promised us under the
Jacksonville agreement,” he said.

He. showed ' that-. the miner works
anaverage of 160~days.a.year and
at the rate of $7.50 a day his income
would- hardly exceed $1,000 a. year
after company expenses had been
deducted. Recent disasters in vari-
ous-mines had._been caused by. inex-
perienced men imported from_ regions
south‘ of the Ohio river, where min-
ing is an unimportant industry,‘ he
said. “It is unfair that because of
theineiliciency in management of

 

eiépectej to absorb the consequent

loss. - [I - E ~
“Defeat for the miners means
oing .back- ﬁfty ‘years. It means

525$ the future generations must be-

condl 'ons once again. It meansthe
re-occurrence“ of conditions. as they
exist in -the southern non-union ﬁelds
today. Victory means a healthier
w manhood, a stronger manhood, and
ad-Iappier childhood,” Robertson con-
cluded. .

days a week, com rising twenty-
eight hours of outsidelstudy as the

are excellent students and very rare-
ly ﬂunk out. 0 T
“Them -' rity of our failures are
primarily ue to lack or study.; the
student should put two ._ hours of

spite the number of failures "our gen-
eral scholarship is improving.. This

year the fraternities have improved .

Dean olbrook of the School of
Engineering and Mines said: “The
School of Engineering and Mines
faculty voted to lace onprobation
all men who fai ed in more than
thirty percent of credit hours taken,
and to drop any student who failed
ﬁfty per cent of his credit hours.
After we applied this rule to stu-
dents of the first semester 1927-
1928, the number of probations fell
to the same number, as that of last
year.”

W.‘ Don Harrison, Dealt of Men

IVE yearsago there wandered on to the campus

” professor who taught students in advanced composi-

position, and ﬁnally the oﬁca of dean

He realized that the college classroom is not the only
possible eetting for teaching. ‘

Harrison’s administration has been the steady raising
of the scholastic standing of the University. The grad-
ual adjustment of student-administration relations to
a, more amicable  is in no small part due to-his
eﬁ'o_rts. The expansion of extracurricular activities,
in which he is heart and soul interested as a ﬁeld for
self-development and creative and voluntary work,
has been under his close supervision. The slowly dy-
ing competitive attitude among Pitt fraternities have
been given an additional deadly blow under his direc-

- Pitt’s.\_Educational Ideals
M ORTALITY rates among Pitt classes took

another hard blow last semester, when a total_of
only 113 students were dropped from four. campus
schools. Showing a decided decrease’ over last year's
number of flunks-and last year's was the record--the.
ﬁgures reported by deans of ‘ the schools reveal that
less than two students in every 100 must drop out of
Pitt for scholastic deﬁciency. A
Entrance -into Pitt is not the most difficult aspira-

‘man, “every student, given..an equal ‘opportunity for
university training, must show once he is admitted to
such training‘ that he is deserving of it.”
The democratic ideal underlying the American sys-
tem of 'education—training for all the children of all
the people-—is put into practice at Pitt.
settlement of this country based on a protest against
efforts to crush human aspiration, it has been the
aim of this country's educators to further the demo-
cratic point - of view in the philosophy of education.
The democratic view insists that all, the stupid and the
wayward, grow, that their growth can be guided to
the‘ advantage of themselves and of society. And so
Pitt attempts to open the door of opportunity to. uni-
versity training to as many as it is able to handle wih
its present limited equipment. Once the student is
admitted, a careful check is kept one his scholastic
achievement throughout his career.
Pitt’s present attitude on the matter of entrance re-
quirements and scholastic requirements during univer-
sity attendance were very aptly stated by Chancellor
E. Benjamin Andrews, who once said at the end of a
usual dreary faculty meeting where there had been
much conﬁxlaints of the ‘shortcomings of freshmen,
.“We “should think more of what our students are
to be when they go out from this university and less
of their failings when they come in.”

 

On With The Parade

HEN the bandwagon comes down the street
a we all jump on)’ The bandwagon plays loud
and long when it happens upon champions, but even
champions come and go with the seasons and then the
bandwagon moves on to new homes, to new champions.
Why has the ‘bandwagon ceased playing encores to
Pitt’: championship‘ football team? When the Golden.
‘Panthers went to the Paciﬁc coast the newspapers and
the air were ﬁlled with words, many of them, prais-
ing the leaders. The‘ very name, “Pitt," was em-
blazoned on the horizon of the press, and the team
was talked about by millions of mouths. Now all has
simmered down and a comparative quiet exists. The
“Golden Panthers” have become “letter men.” The
victories of the team have become past events which
are now unnoticed. And the moralist appears to ask,
“What was it all worth?” "
The value of such large-scale publicity cannot be
measured in dollars and cents. It is but a natural
phenomena in these days: of hero-worship. America
must have its Lindberghs-and so must.Pitt. It had
one in the football team.

And late last week, following its completion of the
most perfect basketball season Pitt has ever "had so
far as number of wins is concerned, a lonely squad of
ﬂoor stars-—heralded as the second of Pitt’: national
champions in the same year--returned home. There
were no town celebrations; not even the acrobatic
cheerleaders showed up, and there wouldn’t have been
anyone to lead in cheers anyhow. Not even the band
was present to lead the boys in Alma Motor and Hail,
Hail, The Gang’s All Here. And Monday the basket-
ball players were on the campus as usual, back at
their studies. Pitt students, apparently, are not hero-
worshipers.

And soon a swimming team will probably be added
to the list of Pitt championship teams:

It is only natural that champions are forgotten, that
famous. men retire into oblivion, and that noted events
become matters of history. For all becomes history
once it has occurred. Such is the way of the world.

I think I can safely say that these
two concerts were the finest, in all
respects, of the season.

Every time this orchestra returns
I become more convinced that its
string section is unsurpassable with
its immediate response to every nu-

_ Friday Evening

Although the Barber of Seville
overture , has been played and mis-
played so many times that everyone
is tired of it, there was something
new, something fresh and charming
about itwhen Toscanini played it.
This comic opera bit was followed
by Beethoven's Sixth Symphony
which can be one of the dullest
things or one of the brightest in
all musical literature. Never once
were its ﬁve long movements tir-
ing, although in this day of realistic

charmingly naive and not a bit wet.
The second half of the program
was not quite so naive-—-and much
more to my taste. Ildebrando Piz-
zetti’s Suite from La. Pisanella——
new to »Pittsburgh—I found to be
a most sensuous and dramatic ex-
ample of “theatre music.” Of the
suite I prefer the third excerpt,
The Dance of Love, or the Perfumed
Death. If someone in this coun-
try would write such music with
some of our plays we would be
willing to be bored by poor plays
just to hear the “incidental” mu-
sic.

HE climax of the evening came
Twith the playing of Dcbussy’s
La Mer, three symphonic sketches.
I have heard this played in various
ways, but never with the passion,
always tastefully restrained, that
Tomanini made us feel. The guani-

concert. I-Iaydn"s. "Symphony in G’
Major sounded-for the first time
in my recollect-ion--as I think it
would have .sounded when first
played in rococo Vienna, charming
and gay. .
Ra_vel’s Daphnig‘ and. Chloe was
less original than other works of his
like La Valse. The third’ . move-
ment was too’. repetitious and the
whole smacked too much of Rim-
sky-Korsakoﬂ and the Ballet ‘Russo.-
De Sabata’s Juoentus, another
new_ work in Pittsburgh,» 
pleasant enough but" a little empty.
Perhaps the composer was think-
ing a little too. much about the
magniﬁcent impression the compo--
‘sltion, would make. Nevertheless,
it contained all the ﬁre and buoy‘-
ancy. related to youth and, in the
discordant descending thirds of the
brasscs, a little of the weltsehnierz
--which is synonomous with youth.
I S with the evening program
the climax came with the last
number. Although Toscanini is an
Ita1ian,,he proved that he. could
comprehend Teutonic passion. Never
before has the Finals to Tristan
and ‘Isolde been more sensual and

with Wagner and. his Gennanic
rumblings, but after Toscanini was
done with the Liebested I was ready
to shout to the stars.

Editor of the »Weekly.

My attention was attracted -to
your editorial. last week on “Literary
Ability,” and I certainly} agree with
your stand on the creation, 'offa._lit-
erary magazine at Pitt. _ ..

It was in. 1919’ after coming to
Pitt‘ from  and .J., where we had
the Washington Jeﬂ’.e_rso*nia*., a lit»
erary publication, that I felt, the
need of such a publication at Pitt
and proceeded to get. .8l.1PPOrt_for it.
We came out with the Pitt Repisw
with Harold Waring as. editor’-in‘-I‘
chief and ‘myself as vbusines” 
ager. Our first issue went 0 with.
8. bﬁllga V .
Soon Harold and myself decided
foolishly enough to enter medical;
school (we are both now “struggling
medics”) and something happened to-
our bruln-child that it‘did 
ish very long. . .

I certainly think there is real-,ne,i,d:.[
for a literary publication at Pitt.‘ If
is just one. of the ways ofshowing
that -the student body at Pitt it a
real student. body and has its quota
of literary ability . as, do other
schools. . Nig: 2 years. have passed-
since our first efforts at‘ establish-
ing a literary magazine. - '-

Here’s hoping they really ‘succeed,
this time and “with a graduate-.man-
ager ’ of non-"athletic activities 
have much more chance of succeed-

kov. “Sunny” Jim Boyd Talks
. To Y..W. C. A. Members
’ On “Lent and Life”

“If, you have a tendency to trust
in the thing itself, do not keep Le_nt,
but if * Lent helps you to live better}
then by all means keep it,” Rev.
“Sunny” Jim Boyd told Y.,W. C. A.
members Monday" in a talk on “Lent
and Life.” ’

Rev. Boyd does not believe in set
‘times and set periods for prayer and
fasting but in keeping Jesus before
him continually. It is much easier to
keep the letter of the law than it is
to keep the spirit.‘ If Lent has spirit
for an individual, then it is worth
w .

 

"In speaking..of' the present ‘coal
situation. Rev. Boyd says that it 18
due to’ one_‘thi‘ng and that one thing
can"be remedied—selﬁshness of_ men.
“When men are Wllllll to give a
full day’: work-_fo_r a-.fu lvdaY’S Pay.
and men are ,wxllmg- to give a- full
day's.pay for a full day's work, then
and onlyhlthen we ,.will have industrial
peace." “*"1"he whole thing,” believes
Rev. Boyd, “depends upon realizing
to the fullest extent the privileges
as‘ a Christian. Too often we are

on walking at the edge ofthe canal;
that is wekeep one hand and one
foot in touch with the world.”

Rabbi Goldenson Addresses
D in n o 1' Meeting of
Philosophy Club

 

"All men, no matter what their
walk of life or their profession have
their speciﬁc problems,” Dr. S. H.
Goldenson of Rodef Shalom Temple
in his address on “What is a Philo-
sophic Problem” at the first dinner
meeting of the Philosophy club last
week at Faculty club. “But it is
doubtful,” he continued, “whether
these problems are so bound up with
these men as the philosophic prob-
lems are with the men of philosophy.

“The sense of wants plus. inflec-
tion is a problem. Philosophy deals
with the problems of man’s progress
and treatment of the subject matter.
If one will scan over books on
physics, chemistry of biology, he
will immediately see a notable dif-
ference. Hewill ﬁnd a statement of
the scope and the principals and a
description of the facts of science.
Philosophy.’ treats with the_prob_lems
of a particular science.”

In discussing the difference be-

tween a philosopher and a scientist,
the_ speaker said that “to the sci-
entist things and events are to be
known only lll the light of a. given
setting, to the other they also wear
a symbohc and prophetic meaning.
“However, to be genuine philosophy,
it must not lose sight of the world
of fact. The partial view is the un-
philoso hical view.
' Dr. oldenson concluded by stat-
ing that philosophy.‘ cannot be a
ﬁned and ﬁnal discipline. Philoso by
Will never presume to s eak the lltst
word; “But it issspea ng the most
adequate and ‘best word in view of
man, ripened experience, and in the
light of the most genuine, compre-
hensive and far-reaching interests of
human life.”/ -

CALLS ARMBRUSTER

Professor of Finance Leaves

For Home In Albany
Monday

A. H. Armbruster, rofessor of
ﬁnance in the school of usiness ad-
‘ministration, left Monday for his
home in Auburn, N. Y., to be absent
indeﬁnitely from the University.
following announcement of the death
of his sisters Flora G. Armbruster
and Rosalie Knapp, and his brother-
in-law, George W. Knapp. All three
were found dead as a result of an
automobile accident which occurred
at Jacks Reefs barge. canal, twelve
miles west of Syracuse.

Pete Bowen Breaks
Indoor Track Marks

Pete Bowen, a graduate of East
Erie high school, where he earned
letters in football, basketball, base-
ball, swimming and track, is chop-
ping down traditional records‘ at
the indoor track house. Recently he
broke the one lap record of 16 7-10
seconds and established in its ‘place
the remarkable time of 15 1-10 sec-
onds. He also shattered the old rec-
ord of 34 9-10 for the two laps,
hanging up the new time of 34‘ 6-10
seconds. .

Bowen. holds all sprint and hur-
dle records in Erie, and has estab-
lished swimming marks in various
tanks throughout Erie and Pitts-
burgh, besides holding the record for
the 220-yard breast stroke at West
Point and Lafa ette. He holds the
A. M. A. recor for the 100-yard
breast stroke event and is rated

frcag artists. ’ . T
oach Frank Shea is ming
Bowen for the coming trac season,
and looks upon him as his most ver-
satile cinder man, depending upon
him for the 100-yard, 220-yard and
quarter‘-mile events. If this “flash
from Erie” continues to improve he
will beconsidered one of the most
logical contenders for the Trotter-
mile classic at the inter—col egiates
in Philadelphia this spring. ,

No‘ Change In Policy -
States New Director‘

' sor . and, keep

“There will be no change in the
athletic policy at Pitt so far as I
know,” stated W. Dbn Harrison, new
athletic director, who succeeds Elmer
F. Blakeslie, early this week.

He continued: “I have only been
at the Job for the past 48 hours and
have really not decided on any deﬁ-
nite steps that may determine what
-you could term an iron-bound policy.
j“We plan to continue the work

« started by Mr. Bla-keslie a little over

a ye_ai-‘ago. Mr. Blakeslie has made
remarkable advances in athletic mat-
ters at,’ the university and has placed
them on a higher plane than ~ they
have everbeen in thehistory of the
school. I will be satisﬁed if we can
continue the work ‘of my predeces-
Pitt atthe top Of~the
athletic world. ‘ _ j

“Under Mr. Blakeslie’s regime
Pitt produced three championship
teams, in football, basketball and
swimming. So I step in with a
sound record behind me that will
take much energy and work to up-
hold. My only experience in the
sport world has been to hold the job
of sports. editor on a mid-Western
newspaper.” ,

In regard to the coming football
campaign the new director remarked,
“I can tell you very little about this
year’s football team; but it is cer-
tain that under the coaching of
Coach Sutherland Pitt is bound to
have a successful season. They face
a hard schedule and may be forced
to accept defeat, but I am sure the
eleven that represents Pitt on the
ﬁeld this fall will be a credit to the
university.” »

Harrison is a ﬁrm advocate of ex-
tensive intra~mural athletics and de-
plores the fact ‘that Pitt‘ is handi-
capped in this line bylack of equip-
ment. “Intra-mural athletics here
are under, the supervision of the
physical, education department. The
facilities ate * meager, but we will
do ‘everything in our power to :aid
the physical education department
and will co-operate with them in
anything they do.” -

Harrison promised that there
would be no recurrence of the situa-
tion at the /Pitt-Notre Dame‘ basket-
ball game, at which hundreds of stu-
dents were turned away after the.
pavilion had been ﬁlled with specta-
tors. Some_method of handling the
students and giving‘ them preference
in such matters ‘will be worked out,
according to Harrison. “We will
consider the interests‘ - of our ﬁve
thousand students ﬁrst in all such
matters.”

VOCATIONAL GROUP;

Tentative Vocational Guide;
I

Conference Program
Considered

Further

annual vocational guidance day and
announcement oi the appointment
to the committee of Lester ll.

Perry, head of the s-tudent employ-3?

ment bureau, took place at a meet-
ing of the vocational committee
Friday at Faculty club.

The tentative program considered‘

by the committee will include the
appearance of a prominent New
York educator and also a well
known educational leader from Chi-
cago. These men whose names have
not been announced will probably
aptﬁzar at an assembly in Memorial

a .

A statement concerning the pur-
pose of vocational guidance day is-
sued by the committee says that
“frequently both time and money
are expended upon preparation for
a -vocation for which the student
often ﬁnds himself totally unﬁt by
inclination and habit. There are al-
so those who complete their college
education and still ﬁnd themselves
adrift. .Vocational guidance is one
answer to the solution of these
problems."

Students attending the vocational

_ guidance meeting will receive inter-

est blanks and arrange for further
meetings and interviews under the
direction of the committee. The vo-
cational interest blanks for use in
determining vocations. which stu-
dents should enter will be scored

e.

’ man to whom students will feel free
in going with their problems.”

. Harrison Vote Unanimous
_ appointment of Mr. Harrison
came late last week, following ap-
proval by the executive committee
of the board of trustees upon recom-
mendation of the athletic council. A
unanimous vote by the council on
Mr. Harrison’s selection followed
Mr. Blakeslee’s resignation.

_ Assuming _duties as athletic direc-
-tor last April in a reorganization of

.the Pitt athletic management, Mr.
Blakeslee continued his work as
divisional superintendent of the
Stone & Webster Construction Co.‘
He supervised the erection of the

. stadium and is at present in charge

of the Cathedral construction.
His position as athletic director
has always been considered tempo-
raiii Mr. Blakeslee devoting most
of 's time to his work as an engi-
neer.‘ As work on the Cathedral
progressed, his duties became in-
creasingly complex and with steel
construction scheduled to begin in
several weeks his full time is de-
manded by the construction project,
says Mr. Blakeslee.
The new director of athletics came
to Pitt from the University of
Akron in 1923, following a varied
career as journalist, military officer,
university teacher and executive.
Following graduation from the Uni-
versity of Iowa in 1916, he served
on the editorial staff of the Des
Moines Tribune and was sporting
' editor of that paper for a short time.
He enlisted in the army the day
war was declared and served twen-
ty-seven months, ,thirteen of which
were devoted to active duty in
France. Upon his‘discharge from
the service he studied for six months

‘ at the University of London.

Comes Here in 1923

Following his return to the United
States he was instructor of English
at the University of Iowa and at
Iowa State College. At the Univer-
sity of Akron he was university edi-
tor and instructor in journalism. He
also wrote for the Cleveland Plain
Dealer and was special correspond-
ent for the Christian Science Moni-

tor.

In 1923 he came to Pitt from
Akron as assistant professor of Eng-
lish. A year later he was appointed
director of college courses in the
downtown division. For six months
he was student counselor and then
became dean of men.

As dean of men, Mr. Harrison was
chairman or member of numerous
important committees, including the
advisory board on student activities,

An experiment conducted by‘ A. W. Kozelka, instructor in Zoology,
shows the comb of the chicken’s head, which has been removed and
grafted on the feathery tissue of the body, where it nowhas a

growth.

Another ex eriment conducted by Mr. Kozelka, in which the spur
of the chic en has been removed from the scaly tissue of the leg
and has been grafted where the comb normally grows.

By FLORENCE LUMAN

Thurston has nothing on A. W.
Kozelka, instructor of zoology, when
the magician reverses the position
of chicken heads or performs other
like feats of magic with the do-
mestic fowl. The onl difference is
that when Master Tbiurston says
presto chango” it is only a tem-
porary transformation, but when
Instructor Kozelka inserts his magic
blade the geoigrasphical position of
the chicken’s extremities are changed
in such a way that they stay
changed. All of which means mere-
ly this: Mr. Kozelka. is conducting
an experiment with chickens. The
experiment is divided (into two
phases, hetrografts, taking of tissues
from one individual and transplant-
ing them to another bird, and auto-
grafts, rernovingof tissues from one
part of the fowl to another portion
of the body.

Mr. Kozelka explains that some
people may laugh and call his ex-
periment “silly.” Superﬁcially their
opinion may be justified, but when
the question is asked, “What will
the establishment of this experiment,
mean?” Mr. Kozelka holds that a
very deﬁnite beneﬁt will be effected
in the medical world. Mr. Kozelka
explains, “The ﬁeld of grafting and
plastic surgery is a relatively re-
cent science, an outgrowth of the
world war to meet the needs of
mutilation.” The last four or ﬁve
years have indicated that there is
a lot to be done in this ﬁeld, and
the question which I hope to answer
is whether it is possible to take the
tissues from one individual to an-
other,” said the research expert.

The experimenter has chosen the
domestic fowl since it has very con-
trasting types of tissue: scaly,
feathery, and the kind of tissue of

A
o.

the comb. Mr. Kozelka. states the

fact, “Most biological laws have a
universal application, and that if tli”:
grafts will take on the fowl it is al-
most certain the identical operations
will -be effective on man.” Also it
is true that man will not lend him-
self to experimental results as will
the dumb animal.

Mr. Kozelka has found so far that
the number of positive hetrografts
is very small. “Usually there is a
distinct antagonism of the two types
of tissues which is expressed by the
swelling of the surrounding tissues
in the excess formation of capil-
laries, also, that a skin disease has
developed in several cases. As a
result of several hundred grafts
there have been only twelve really
positive ones, which represent forty
per cent of the grafts, that were
positive. The other sixty per cent
were,. at ﬁrst, positive, but in the
course of time were absorbed and
showed no signs of growth in their
new positions,” explains Mr. Kozel-
ka. The other forty er cent de-
velop normally, regard ess of what
part of the body to which they have
been transplanted.

“There are three schools or points
of view in regarding this project,”
said Kozelka.’ One group which
holds. that the transformation of tis-
sues can only be effected in fable
and ﬁction.
ﬁfty per cent of the operations. will
be successful, and the third, or inter-
mediate group, which insists that the
transformation can be only effective
in fowl of the same blood group.

“For those who are soft hearted,
may I add, that at no time does the
bird suﬁfer any pain,” said Kozelka.
“An anesthetic is administered to
the chicken just as to the human
when he undergoes an operation.”
He explains that the mortality of the
chicken is negligible, since the op-
erations are minor ones.

ROMAN NUMERAL ONE; COMMA
FAULT, REMINISCES HARRISON

By HONORA DELANEY

1. Review (Roman numeral one).

“What is a concrete detail, Miss
Smiggens”?

Thus Mr. Harrison used to bang
into a class back in the days when
he taught freshman English and led
enterprising upperclassmen through
the mires of connotations and mood
of place. When we ﬁrst strolled
across the campus he was assistant
professor of English and he held his
conferences up in 213, where he used
to talk about poetry and beautiful
things to  «

And then after two years of
teaching, years which he often says
ghe enjoyed most of all the years he
;spent at Pitt, Mr. Harrison became
iDcan Harrison, and everyone about
;school began to talk of him and to

lconsult him about schedules and tui-5
gtion. We remember the ﬁrst dayi
gwe visited his new oflice. It was‘
idifierent from the old yellow rooms:
with their desk and awkward chairsf
,up in Alumni. I
%in the door modestly and quietly as;
{freshman do when they go to con-!
éferences, we were introduced and:
{proceeded by a picture and record of '
lall the sins which we had committed 5
‘during our stay about the campus:
?And then the office itself was ai
jrevelation. Mr. Harrison sat en-5
gthroned in a high backed chair with;
§a telephone jangling at his elbow-

Often during these.

desk from him and talked, but we
neglected poetry and discussed most
often of schedules and futures.
Yesterday we climbed to the sta-
dium to see Athletic Director Har-
rison. The throne chair is gone, but
the man who taught us the ways of
commas and clashes in English I,
still sits behind the desk. He is
much the same person, talking yet
of the things that really matter.
He would never want a long eulo-
gy on his work as a dean or as an
English instructor or as a. newspaper
reporter or as a soldier—-all of
which ofﬁces he has ﬁlled and en-
joyed. He would never want us to
see him differently because of the
oﬁices he holds. We have known
him these four years as an adven-
turer, a lover of zestful living.

TO HORSFALUS UNlTl

Pitt Professor’s Battery Gets;
Trophy For Gun- 
Firing ;

 

The Knox Trophy, one of the most 
coveted mementoes awarded to or- g

ganizations in the United States
Army, has been awarded to Battery
E, 52d Coast Artillery, a. unit or-
ganized by Major Lloyd P. Horsfall,
professor of military science and
tactics at Pitt. ‘

At the beginning of the late war;
Major Horsfall was selected to or-’
ganize two companies in the coast
artillery to guard President Wilson
and the.White House. As soon as
the guard was organized he was sent
to Fort Washington, Md., to prepare
for foreign service. The battery,
which was augmented by additional
forces, was organized into Battery
1, Eighth Provisional Artillery Regi-
ment, in February, 1918. On July
15 of the same year the outﬁt was
christened Battery E, 52d Coast Ar-
tillery.

The trophy was awarded to the
battery as a result of a target prac-
tice in which Battery E ﬁred eight-
een shots in eight and one-half min-
utes at a range of about eight miles,
scoring a direct hit on a moving
target ﬁfteen feet square.

The Knox Trophy was established
and is annually awarded by the so-
ciety of the sons of the revolution
of Massachusetts in honor of Major
General Henry Knox, former chief of
artillery in the Revolutionary Army,
and, after Washington, ﬁrst com-
mander-in-chief ‘of American forces.

ON FLIMSY EXCUSE

dent what to do when there are pa-
pers to publish and bills to pay. And
aft*r meeting when the crowd ad-
journs to an Oakland restaurant for
more borrowed cigarettes, he dis-
courses on books and things just as
he does once a month in the Panther.
That's a ﬁne page that he writes;
we prize each one carefully and put
it away to be re-read and requoted
whenever we talk of best sellers. The
Panther, the Owl, the Weekly staff
—all depend on Ernie for support of
any kind. Sometimes it’s pictures
for the humor section; sometimes it’s
sketches for an issue; sometimes it’s
editorials; sometimes it’s just ordi-
nary horse-sense advice. (We ﬂing
the bouquet of thanks, Ernie.)

But in spite of all these things,
Ernie is an instructor of English, _in
the gentle art of avoiding comma
faults and of composing‘ periodic
sentences. That is why he sits,
scratching his head, at a desk in
Alumni, that is why people bother
him endlessly about themes. Mr.
Wright M. A. (soon to be M .
Wright Ph. D.) is the same indivi -
ual as Ernie of Quill and Of Books
and Things.

His classes have a delightful for-
mality; he knows his students and
they know him. "He has a. circle of
girls and fellows (those who twist
words and write for the Weekly, the
Panther, etc., and who hope some-
day to break into. . . . .you’ve
_heard them rave) whom he encour-
lish classes with mysterious letters,
2kk and 2kkk, and English 26, ad-
vanced composition which class has
the usual number of people inter-
ested in creative writing since they
have made a B in freshman Eng-'
lish. Downtown he has a class’
which specializes in reading and
writing literature. And then there’s
a Saturday class about which we
hear indeﬁnite things.

Before coming to the University
to teach, Ernie has washed dishes
in hotel kitchens, gathered news for
small town papers, played the piano
at movies, cut ice on Conneaut Lake,
and journeyed over England and the
States on foot and “on the rods.”

But you ask whether he is young
or old. He's neither—he’s Ernie of
the bright scarf and wooly black
overcoat, of the brief case,loaded
with books which people wish to
borrow, of the bookcases and the
grand piano in his home up in Irwin,
of the baked bean suppers and the
delicious coffee, of the poetry. . . .
He is Ernie, Pitt's Ernie. Now don’t
crowd 301 Alumni. He's ours ﬁrst,
isn’t he, Sam?
