crease of $404.94 over the $2,596.59
contributed last year. The num-
ber of’ students who contributed
was also increased from 2768 last
year to a total of 2879 this year.
"Theodore . W. Biddle, acting
dean of men and chairman of the
drive, expressed his gratitude in
the following letter to the ‘student
body: ‘

Regardless of whether one team
is far superior to the other, or

neither team has much of an edge

Pitt needs this game to atone
for their early season failures,

lln -1936 Herrymon Maurer -grad-
uated from the University of Pitts-'
burgh. * ,

As a student Maurer had taken
a large part in college activities.
 Besides work on the publications
.  in the dramatic society he held
 bership in Omicron "Delta
hppa, Pi Tau Phi, Theta Alpha
hi, and Quill club. He ' was far
liﬁssore advanced than the average
_lc.ollege student in that he had made

"{_English, philosophy, comparative
_literature, and comparative reli-
gion towards the aim of a critical
1 work on the history of ideas.

— After ‘graduation he did some
‘advertising copy-work and ghost
' writing. His articles have appear-
ed in the magazines Asia, This
~-Week, and the New Republic. A
new book, “Beneath Heaven All’s
Strife,” has just been accepted for

mon Maurer when his book “The
End Is Not Yet” appeared. In it
he had translated that desire to
know the earth's peoples into a
concentrated study of the Chinese
people and the war. Subtitled
“China at War” the book, differs
from the usual works on the war
in Chinain that it ‘deals not with
battles and generals ‘but with the.
people themselves. .

Maurer was well able to write
on the Chinese war, for he arrived
in China in 1938 in the midst of
an epic Chinese migration. Hos-
pitals and universities had been
moved with the people. The Uni-
versity of Nanking at which Maur-
er was a newly appointed profes-
sor of languages had been moved
to Chengtu in the province of
Szechwan.

Added to the general complica-
tions arising from the constant
bombing and the crumbling dwel-
ings was the situation of young
Mrs. Maurer and their newly born
child. This constant aerial bom-
bardment plus the growing danger

being rewarded with some job, we
would not have “puppets” for ex-
ecutives, and payrolls cluttered up
with petty, incapable politicians.

Though it may come with the
Democrats or even a third party,
we are inclined to feel that good
government will originate with the
Republican parties, dishonest and
reactionary as they have been.
This is simply because the GOP
politicos are the weakest today,
and conscientious Republicans will
have a less difficult time wresting
control from them.

Americans, discouraged by the
sad condition of local governments,
are, despite recent trends to the
contrary, almost as complacent as
the Chinese who don’t even require
their ofiicials to keep books, though
they know grafting is continually
going on. This is part of Confu-
cious’ philosophy and without at-
tempting to be facetious, we might
say it results in considerable con-
fusion. It may succeed in keeping
the Chinese ignorant and thus con-
tent, but it is hardly conducive to
good government.

When government service men
demonstrate that good government
is a possibility in a few cities such
as Chicago, Philadelphia, Jersey
city and Pittsburgh, the people will
become aroused and the rest of
the nations will follow suit.

Even in times of great interna-
tional danger such as these, we
must not lose sight .:of the prob-
lems of democracy, since it is part-

luctantlvv to pack up and take the
clipper back to the United States.

Included‘ among the ten pounds of
luggage allowed him by the air-
lines was the manuscript of his
book. i »

Beginning‘ with the Shanghai in-
cident which was "the opening
chapter in Japan's all-out struggle
to conquer, the vast sprawling
lands of China, Maurer carefully
traces the course of the war and
its effect on the people. He gives
an insight into the psychology of
this people who, disunited, scatter-
ed, and given no chance whatso-
ever to survive against the onrush-
ing Japanese, have managed to re-
sist, not for days or weeks, or
even months, but for five years
and who grow stronger as time
goes on.

Actual contact with Japanese
warriors serve to strengthen rath-
er than to weaken the Chinese.

“The most patriotic Chinese,” says
Maurer, “is the one who comes in
contact with the invader.”

The Chinese people are not re-
vengeful, points out Maurer.
Though they have had the oppor-
tunity, they have refrained from
retaliation bombing. There is also
a reluctance to place the blame for
what has and is happening on the
Japanese people.

Never maudlin, the book pre-
sents a keen, warm, and sympa-
thetic understanding of the Chin-
ese people. It is written in a lei-
surely facile manner and is ﬁnely

With all their greeting cliches
shined up and ready for use, Pitts-
burgh society turned out the other
night for the ‘Oscar Levant con-
cert; turned out complete with too-
Btiﬂ’ collars and too-revealing de-
colletage. ‘ ‘  l ‘
There were the usual sleeping
"husbands being poked in their
well-padded ribs by the usual
pseudo-esthetic wives. There was
tolerant Fritz Reiner, more amused
than impressed by the rhythms of
Cershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue;"
and one must forget the super-
‘cilious musicians, grinning conde-
acendingly when the trumpeter got
“on the beam."

Intermission brought ‘them with
their Brenda Frazier bobs and their

sweeping ‘skirts that ‘got under "

each other’s feet, into the smoke-
ﬁlled lobby. And the end of the
performance sent them, scurrying
to their favorite private club and
us to the trolley-car stop.

We sat during the ride home be-
side two members of the orchestra
——violinists. They spoke in cultur-
ed tones of this musician’s inter-
pretation and that one's deliver-
ance.

For a few minutes they sat si-
lent, then one turned to the other:

“Say,” he said, “ven iss Benny
Guudman comink to town?”

This has been a semester that
gives testimony to many of our
eltlors’ admonishments about the
lack of seriousness on the part of
college students today.

A few weeks ago it was stu-
dents at an eastern college who
requested that professor’: lectures
be transmitted to dorms and fra-
ternity houses via radio, thus elim-
inating the necessity of attending

:_ -classes.

Recently there appeared in the
Gettysburgian, official student pub-
lication of Gettysburg college, an
editorial entitled “Regular Satur-
day Dances -Can Happen Here!”

“Everybody is dissatisﬁed with
the present social set-up on the
campus," mourned the editors.

Here is a suggested list of dances
which the student body brought up
for consideration by the adminis-
tration:

Small informal dances every Sat-
urday night, a BIG fall Military
ball on Friday night followed by
the usualfraternity pledge dances
Saturday night, the regular frater-
nity Christmas parties, a BIG mid-

‘ winter Junior prom on Friday
night followed by the regular in-
formal Saturday affair. . . .

By Nornmn 1l«Iarcu.r and Herb Reingold

Here we go again . . . Overlooked
in the stream of new songs is the
beautifuly melodic “Who Shall I
Turn To,” excellently recorded by
Shep Field's new brassless band.
Nocturne” on the re-
verse is a mediocre instrumental.
.. . . Listen for the superb vocal on
Wayne King’s “Darling How You
Lied.” “Jumpin’ Jupiter” is one
of those rare King swing specials.

On Bluebird this week, Freddie
Martin dishes up another “Con-
certo" in n his arrangement of
“Symphony Moderne,” taken from
the theme of “Four Wives" and
played by John Garﬁeld. Discmate
“Anniversary Waltz" is a cut-dry
three-quarter time ditty for the
long hairs. . . . That nasal-toned
Tech troubador, Vaughan Monroe
waxes “Something New” (It's
about time) and “I Struck a
Match in the Dark." (This ought
to throw a little light on the vocal
situation.) The band is in bad need
of a good male vocalist. . . . Ziggy
Elman's ﬁne rendition of the tradi-
tional “Eli, Eli,” gpotlights more
superb trumpet work released on
records recently.

Tommy Dorsey (what control
that man has!) turns in a neat
smooth job of soloing on the Alex
Stordahl arrangement of “None
But the Lonely Heart” . . . Those
who like the Art Tatum style of
pianoing will want to hear Herman
Chittison's ﬁngering of “Flamin-
go” and_ “The Man I Ldve.” . . .
Kay Kyser hits the Record Stack
this week with recordings of two
novelties from his movie “Play-
mates” namely “Humpty Dumpty
Hea ” and “Romeo Smith and
Juliet Jones."

For topflight arrangements, Les
Brown’: ﬁne band scores again
with “Do You Care,” slighted by

:2!

Betty Bonney's vocal. Discmate is
the grand “Lament to Love." . . .
We see that classical urge crop-
ping up again in Jan Savitt’s re-
cent recordings. Following a two-
faced disc of “Afternoon of a
Faun,” Savitt presses “In the Hall

_ of the Mountain King” and “Little
Fugue” (Apologies to Bach) . . .
Sammy Kaye predicts that “Hon-
eybunch” will be a top-notch tune,
but we like “This ls No Laughing
Matter" on the reverse as the tune
to achieve popular appeal.

By the way, listen for Sammy’s
Waxing of “The Shrine of St. Ce-
cilia.” . . . Those who appreciated
Raymond Paige's “Musical Ameri-
cana Album” will certainly want
to obtain his newest album which
includes such hits as “Stardust,”
“Donkey Serenade,” etc. '

TglNGS TO LOOK FORWARD
T :

We just found out that Leighton
Noble has been signed to play the
Freshman dance on Dec. 5. For
some really sm-oo-th dancing we
suggest that you attend the ﬁrst
big venture of the class of '45.

Be sure to listen for Claude
Thornhill on the Fitch Bandwagon
next Sunday. Here is America’s
Number one up-and-coming band.

MUSICAL COMMENTS:
Quite a few students who heard
Jimmy Dorsey this week did not
like his music. Master James is
strictly a commercial type'of band
that appeals to juke-box lovers,
but seems not to make any head-
way with tho college crowd. _- ..
‘SONG OF THE WEEK:

Thanks to Rachmaninoff,‘ a new
song has arrived that is a sure bet
to reach the top. Taken from his
“Concerto in‘C Minor,” the number
titled “I Think of You,” is being
featured by Will Bradley and Tom-
my Dorsey. "  '

news of,some Pitt graduate having

a story or novel published., Herry-

man Maurer’s (Pitt ’36) book on ;
China has been reviewed in the 
Pitt News, the Pittsburgh Press 
and the Bulletin Index. This week

a story by Freer Stalnaker, for-
mer student of Mr. Hunt, is pub-

lished in the November American
Mercury. Titled “The Victor,” the

story seems at ﬁrst glance to be

some kind of political allegory.

It is interesting, by the way, to
see how the Mercury has changed
since its hell-raising MOIICICGII-N83
than days. Edited by Eugene Ly-
ons it has now settled down to a
mild, more or less conventional
liberalism.

Outlines, 341 Boulevard of the
Allies, announces special student
memberships at $5.00 a year. Stu-
dent memberships include free ad-
mission to the gallery during ex-

hibits, rental rates of one-half the ,_..,
usual charge for borrowing books 
or records, the same reductions 
that are allowed regular members 
on admissions to movies, lectures, '_

etc., and reductions on articles
bought through the gallery.

A new exhibition at Outlines,

including a display of functional .

jewelry, is now open.

Short story writers on campus, 
and they seem to be legion, should

Henri Temianka 

Will Be Soloist

 With Symphony ’

Henri Temianka, the new con-
certmaster of the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony orchcstra, will make his de-
but as soloist under the baton of
Fritz Reiner tonight and this Sun-
day afternoon at the Syria Mosque.
He will play the Beethoven Violin
concerto.

In commemoration of the one-
hundredth anniversary of Dvorak’s
birth, Reiner has selected Dvorak's
“New World Symphony No. 5" as
the major orchestral work on the
program. The opening piece will"
be the American Festival overture
by the American composer, Wil-
liam Schumann.

Henri Temianka calls himself a
“cosmo-Pole.” He was born in
Scotland of Polish parents, and was
educated in Holland and the Unit-’
ed States. '

_ Temianka was to resume his Eu-
: ropean concert tour, but the pres-

 ent situation forced him to cancel

I his engagements. After a success-
ful tour in the West Coast, he re-
turned to New York to perform on
the concert stage and radio.
Among his performances was one
on “Alec Templeton Time."

year. A total of .103 more subscrib-
ers were registered- .

From the 128 who took out

year, 19 made use of it. These Pitt
Women spent a total of 157 daysin
the hospital, receiving service from’
the hospitalization association
amounting~to $718.90.

For the first time this year every
woman student not living at home
or with relatives was required by
the Woman's Health service to
either take auto insurance or to

_ make some other arrangement so
that in case of illness she could be
immediately removed from the
house in which she is living. Only
two resident women made plans
other than hospitalization.

Student hospitalization is spon-
sored by the Pitt News and the

Student Health association. This

is the second year that the plan has
been presented to the students.

Final totals are expected this

week when results of the men’s
hospitalization campaign are re-
vealed. -

Local football pep rallies and
victory parades sometimes rise to

 great heights, but none of them can
compare to the one he.ld in Hous-
ton, Texas, last Saturday night.

Hundreds of Texas A&M col-
lege cadets, arriving for the Texas
Aggie-Rice institute football game,
{ ‘held a midnight pep rally in down-

town Houston. The cadets started
by blocking traffic and turned in
a ﬁre alarm. _

Nine ﬁretrucks from four sta-
tions roared into the mixup. Then
a policesquad arrived and resorted
to teargas to break up the riot. This
was effective for a time, but the
stubborn cadets soon returned to
continue their hullabaloo.

J bed and joined the scene. He called
oﬁ the police and let the cadets
go on with th.eir cheering, but told
‘them to obtain city council permis-
sion for future rallies.

Educational
Ideas Stay  
Unchanged
AUSTIN, Texas, November 21.
—-Results of last week’s national
poll of Student Opinion Surveys of
America reveals that during the
last two years only a slight in-
crease in the number of collegfans
who believe higher education

should stress technical and profes-
sional training has been noted.

Nearly one-fourth of the men
favor technical and professional
training on the subject of techni-
cal and professional versus a cul-
tural training.

Draft and dateless weekends
have not changed the minds of col-
lege women, however, for only 16
per cent of them are against a cul-
tural background.

Men are feeling the emphasis
' that the war is placing on scientiﬁc
advancement, and are getting pre-

according to answers given inter-
viewers. '

A Pomona Junior college fresh-
man typically answered interview-
er: “If we lose sight of the basis
of education and let war hysteria
dominate our better judgment, we
will ﬁnd when the national emerg-
ency is over that we have lowered
the level of education unnecessar-
ily.”

continued from page one

1 Pitt-Penn State games have al-
ways been characterized by clean
sportsmanship which is one of the
reasons that these two schools have
met so often.

Pitt scouts who watched the

V Lions in action all season seem to
fear their offensive attack. “Pep-
per” Petrella is used essentially as
5 spot runner. All the State line
has to do is give him a chance to
get started, then walk down the
field for the extra-P°lnt- 33“
5maltz’s passing this year-"has im-
proved for he has been the spear-
head of the air-minded State

squad.

Critics seem to be of the opinion
that the Panther squad will let
down this weekend. But. 011 the
contrary, for they are looking ‘for-
ward to this game just as much as
the Penn State players.

What the local fans should wor-
ry about is the physical condition
of the gridders. After playing sev-
en straight contests with as strong

opposition as the Panthermen
jnyg, they are bound to be worn
out.

Walter West, veteran quarter-
back, has not worked out with the
team all week for he is on the in-
jured list with a sore side. West
has been playing a bang-up ball

..= all season, and has usually been a
60 minute man. It takes a power-
fully built boy with a strong side
to block out the enemy ends when
they come charging in towards the
ball carrier, and West, although
powerfully built, would have a def-
inite handicap with his weak side.

Ralph Hammond took over the
‘signal calling post in the Nebraska
game, and played magniﬁcent ball.

All-American Edgar" Jones is
ready to go this week for his shoul-
tier has mended. Jones will have
an added incentive this weekend
because he is carrying a grudge
against the Staters, which should
make his ball playing as close to
perfect as one can get. Lack of a
‘good passing attack hampered the
Panthers last week, but with Jones
again throwing, Pitt is expected to
go partially air-minded.

Jack Durishan and Bill Beng-
liauser have been developing into
- standout performers in the past
two games. Benghauser probably
played the greatest game of his
career last Saturday against the
Huskers, and is apt to do it again
tomorrow.

Durishan was hurt prior to the
Nebraska fracas and did not start
the c0nt.e:<.t._ He has been going
great guns in drills this week and
should start the game this week-

insists. “The were marvelous. All
l did was run.”

A physical education major,
Jones would like to coach or teach
after graduation, though, of course,
the army has first call on him. He
has already received feelers from

‘some of‘ the pro ball clubs but,

while he is not averse to playing
for pay, it will take a pretty good
offer to make him do it.
Fan mail and gifts began pour-
ing in after the Fordham game.
Probably the most unique gift
he has received was the one given
him following the Nebraska game.

A Pittsburgh rooter approached

Jones after the game. “You're
bringing home the bacon,” he said
“Why not take the whole hog?”
Whereupon he thrust a squirrning
little porker into Jones’ arms. The
pig entertained the entire football
squad during the ride home by

running up and down" the ail lea.
At present he (the pi ) is quar-
tered at the stadium. Jniifact, he
has already been adopted as an un-
official mascot by the taunt.‘

The biggest thrill of Jones’ col-  . ..

lege career, however, was last
year's game against Penh State
which Pitt won 20 to 7 thus ruin-
ing State's undefeated record.
Jones gets a particular" joyout of
beating State for he has his own
personal grudge against them. It
seems that once upon a time all
arrangements were made for him
to attend that institution and then
something happened. Jones doesn't
like them and they don't like him.
Jones had nothing against -,Ford-
ham and Nebraska and look what
happened. He has something
against Penn State.

Coach Higgins Guides
Rebirth of State Football

When Bob Higgins joined the
Penn State coaching staff in 1928
he was merely returning to the
scene of former triumphs, for Hig-
gins -had turned in brilliant per-
formances as end on the Nittany
Lion teams of 1914, 1915, 1916 and
1919. The breach was caused by
Higgins entrance into the army in
the fall of 1917. Even in the army
he played football on the cham-
pionship 89th Division ‘eleven, and
he was selected end on Grantland
Rice’s “All A.E.F.” team.

When he returned to Penn State
in the fall of 1919, Higgins was
again elected captain of the foot-
ball eleven. His team defeated
Cornell, Penn, Pittsburgh, Buck-
nell, Lehigh, Gettysburg, and Ur-
sinus, losing only to Dartmouth.
He was named by Walter Camp on
the first All-American eleven that
season.

The ﬁnal game he played for
Penn State against Pittsburgh has
become legendary in athletic his-
tory. In the ﬁrst quarter Pitt had
carried the ball to the State ﬁve
yard line and lost it on downs. Ex-
pecting a kick at this stage of the
game, the Panther backs closed in.
Instead, Harold Hess dropped back
of the goal line and passed to Hig-
gins, on the ﬁfteen, who ran the
remaining 85 yards for a touch-
down which took the heart out of
Pop Warner’s team.-

when he became head football

coach at West Virginia Wesleyan

in the fall of 1920. In 1921 he
joined the Canton Bulldogs, a pro-
fessional team, as playing coach.

He returned to Wesleyan in 1922

and his team won eight games of a

ten-game schedule. In 1923 and

1924 it was necessary for him to

rebuild his team but he accom-

plished this so successfully that in

1924 the Bobcats won nine out of

eleven encounters.

: In 1925 Bob went: to "Washington
university at St. Louis as head
coach. Here again, re-building was
a slow process and it was not until
1927 that his completely new sys-
tem began to show results. This
season was the best year the Bears
had ever experienced in the Mis-
souri Valley conference.

He became head coach of foot-
ball and professor of physical edu-
cation at Penn State in March,
1930. He took over the head coach-
ing reins when Penn State ﬁrst be-
gan to feel the effects of a non-
subsidization policy. For ﬁve years
it was a disheartening experience
for a new coach who could never
become accustomed to defeat. But,
gradually his hard work began to
show results. Last year only Pitts-
burgh succeeded in defeating the
Lions.

It was fate, however, that played
the cruelest trick of all on the

State Sports Scribe Describes
Nittany Lion Football Games

By BOB SCHOOLEY.
Penn State, Daily Collegiate

Faced with the problem of re-
building the entire forward wall
this season, Coach Bob Higgin’s
gridders have gained valuable ex-
perience as the season progresses.
Penn” State’s line, composed of
mostly sophomores and juniors,
has developed, into a formidable
combination.

' In the ﬁrst game of the season,
the Nittany Lions entered the bat-
tle with Colgate’s eleven. The Red
Raiders were favored over the
Lions, but Coach Higgins’ men
fought on even terms until Coach
Andy Ke.rr’s reserve backﬁeld pow-
er ﬁnally subdued the Lions in the
fourth quarter. Penn State’s grid-
men reached a peak of high spirit-
ed play and displayed ﬁne blocking
and tackling. The green line was
given its ﬁrst test when Colgate
drove to the one-foot mark. With
four downs to make one foot, the
Lions braced and performed as vet-
erans, but yielded to a score on the
last down. The famous_Bill' Smaltz-
to-Len Krouse passing combina-
tion did not get started too well,
but the boys played exceptionally
good ball.

The Nittany Lions’ home opener
was one of the most thrilling. Buck-
nell's Bisons invaded the State col-
lege gridiron and rung up two
touchdowns against the Nittany
Lions before the game was two
minutes old. The first score came
on a pass from Co-Captain Mel
Knupp to Al Magagna for 21
yards. A Penn State fumble, an-
other pass from Knupp to Magag-
na, another touchdown.

Two blocked kicks paved the way
to two scores for the Nittany Lions.
Spending a great deal of time on
practicing blocking kicks, Coach
Higgins’ men applied that knowl-
edge. Before the first quarter was
over, Ken Schoonover, tackle,
crashed through the Bison line to
block a kick. Wilbur Van Lenten,
end, chased the ball, scooped it up
and ran almost to the goal line.
Pepper Petrella did the rest, scor-
ing over right tackle, Smaltz, the
gentleman with the educated toe,
split the goal posts with the sev-
enth point. A few minutes after
the second quarter began Van Len-
ten blocked a kick and Schoonover
fell on it. Petrella again sliced
through for a touchdown and
Smaltz added the extra point.

Not desiring to detract from the
ability of Andy Tomasic and Com-
pany, Coach Higgins and his
charges declare that the Temple
Owls outplayed the Nittanymen in
all departments, winning 14-0. Per-
haps the turning point in the game
for the Lions came when the ﬁrst
quarter was only a few minutes
old. Bill Smaltz, talented passer
and punter, was injured. From
there on the Lions seemed to play

, listless ball, ‘rapper Pet;,_ella:s_houl-

I

was or  ant:/may 

  

.dered the burden of most of the

ball carrying. Jack Banbury, re-
serve fullback, was particularly ef-
fective against the Owl forward
wall, but he was unable to break
away for any sizeable gains. John
Jaffurs, guard, was also lost to the”
Nittanymen by an inj_ury_— Thus
disheartened, the.Penn State grid.
ders were pushed at will.

Against Lehigh and New York
university it was a comparatively
998? for the Lions to come up with
victory. The Lions trounced Le-
high, 40-6 and ran wild with the
reserves playing about half of the‘.
game- A major upset was scored in
the minds of the New York
Writers

Graduation Wrecks

Entire State Line

Pitt’s annual ‘battle with Penn
State this year ﬁnds them facing
a team that is not as strong as last
season's State eleven, but a team
that will be in there for sixty min-
utes giving there all for a victory.

Flsnking'Stste’s very weak line
are ends Wilbur Van Lenten and
A John Potsklan, a junior and a soph-
omore. Neither of these boys have
had much expe-
rience, in fact 
the entire Nit-
tony line is new.
The entire ﬁrst
string line and
most of the ex-
p e r i enced re-
serves from last 
season graduat-  ‘
ed or w e r e

Jtlklfted.

At the tackles, Bob Higgins, has
a converted center, Mike Kerns,
and Ken Schoonover, two juniors.
Kerns is a varsity wrestler, and
weighs about 220. Schoonover
6-2, and goes about -195.

Both guards, Donald “Red" Yo-
-ho and Bob Perugini, are light in
comparison to most guards, and
_.,hsve had very little experience.

 

WEAVER

~., I Neither weighs over 180 pounds.

    
 

Last year Leon Gajecki was all-
. American center for State, and was
. ' sixty minute man throughout the
' ~ason. Thus, none of the reserve

 , .
centers had any actual playing

time. Bob Wear, 200 pound senior,
will probably draw the starting as-
signment.

Last year Smeltz, Krouse, and
Petrells. were the players who gave
the Panthers s. headache, with Pe-
trells. in particular proving himself

- troublesome. He was off on long

dashes, time after-time, and tried

_ valiantly to stave oﬂ-' defeat. Pep-
“-per is next to the smallest man on

the State squad, standing only 5

feet 8 inches, and weighing only
160 pounds.

Captain Len Krouse and Ralph
Ventresco will hold down the half-
back spots. Krouse was State’s
leading scorer last year and is hav-
ing another good year. He’s a
senior, stands an even six feet, and
weighs 175 pounds.

Junior P a 111
Weaver under-
studied John Pat-
rick last‘ year
and will be at
the quarterback
post ' tomorrow. ,_,
He’s a six footer,
weighing 2 1 5
pounds, and is
one of the few
experienced play-
ers in the squad.

 

PETRELLA

Ventresco alternates with John
“Pepper” Petrella at the tailback
position. Ventresco is a junior and
is rated to be a fast man, while
“Pepper” is held for spot running.

An oddity about the Statelteam
is the presence of a player who
stands only 5-5, and weighs only
145 pounds. He is Billy Mazzocco,
a junior from Pittsburgh, who
plays at left half.

Outstanding man on the squad
is fullback Bill Smaltz, who is not-
ed for his passing and kicking. He
isn't rated as 3 fast runner, but is
good at cracking the line.

Thus Pitt will be facing a team
with a good backﬁeld, but a team
that has a very weak line; a line
that has handicapped the back-
ﬁeld this season. The backﬁeld
men are the only ones who have
had any experience previous to
this year. On the basis of this, a
Pitt win over the Nittany lion is
not improbable.

By EARL BURLOFF and DAVE‘ DIQBY
The fraternity and engineering

touch football kings were crowned
last Tuesday and Wednesday, with

_Phi Epsilon Pi and the AE&ME

seniors being the winners of those
championships. I

The Phi Eps tripped the PiKA’s
in the Greek ﬁnale, 12-6, to bring
the fraternity championship to
their house for the ﬁrst time in
Phi Ep history at Pitt.

Freshmen “Figgy" Dutch, who.

has starred all season for the Phi
Eps, passed to Bob Coleman soon
after the game got underway, giv-
ing the new fraternity champs a
six-point lead, which they never
gave up.

In the second half Jimmy Deu-
telbaum was on the receiving end
of a pass from Dutch to give the
Phi Eps their ﬁnal touchdown of
the game. After that play the Phi

Eps were content to play a de-

fensive game, as they protected
their 12 point advantage.

With the time running out,
PIKA took to throwing long, des-
perate pssses in an effort to cap-
ture the crown that was slowly
moving out of their reach. One of
these long passes from Carlson to
Ralph Wilde found its mark, and
gave the losers their only score of
the game.

The Phi Ep attack, defensively
as well as offensively, was center-
ed around ﬁve players. Phil Dutch,
Bob Goleman, Jim Deutelbaum,
Bob Bronk, and Hal Weissman.
The victory gave the Phi’ Eps the
right to meet the AE&ME seniors,
the recrowned engineering cham-
pions.

The AE&ME seniors retained
the engineering league title by
beating the AE&ME frosh and

Men's Glee Club «Sings

The Men’s Glee club will present
its ﬁrst program of the year to-
night at the Chancellor's reception
for the parents of freshmen.

Theodore M. Finney, associate
professor and head of the depart-

ment of music appreciation, and,

director of the glee club, has ar-
ranged the following program for
this evening:

“Hall to Pitt;” “On the Sea” by
Dudley Buck; “Were You There ?”,
a Negro spiritual by H. T. Bur-
leigh; “Morning Hymn” by Isidore
Georg Henschel; Arthur E. Hall’s
“High Barbary;” Pitt “Victory

The game started out as a rout
for the seniors, as they scored soon

after the opening kickoff, but their:

attack soon bogged down. The
touchdown came on a pass from
“Bulgy Dave” Mamaux, star of the
seniors, to Gerbore.

After that, the game became a
series of arguments with the ref-
lame, and hot words ﬂew from both
sides.

The second half found Mamaux
ﬁnding the range again, and this
time Yates caught his long pass,
to sink the frosh and sophs.

Midway in the second half the
frosh and sophs ﬁnally scored, as
Bill “Irish” O'Connell passed to
Hohos. The rest of the game saw
‘the seniors playing a watchful,
cautious game, while the frosh and
sophs took chances on every play,
for they desperately tried to tie
the score or go ahead.

However, the senior defense was
good enough to stymie the des-
perate attack, and thus the AE&
ME seniors are the engineering
league champions for the second
consecutive season.

In the independent loop, the un-
beaten, unscored upon Punks, roll-
ed over the Oilers, 47-0. as they
reached the ﬁnal of the circuit. The
Punks took a lot of time to get
started as they led by only seven
points at the half. However, they
quickly warmed up as the second
period got underway, and scored
40 more points.

Azein it was Eddie “Lefty” Ziol-
kowski, who bombarded the oppo.
sition with passes, and again it
was “Ziol” who connected with

I all year, Larry Paifrath and Ta};

most of his passes, as the Punln

toyed with their opposition.

Two other of Dr. Car-lson’s_
glamour boys, who have starred;

Malarkey, scoredthree times each,
while Paul Lohmeyer added three
of the conversion points. Johnny
Swacus and Ralph Josephs also ﬁg-
ured in the scoring as they each -
scored once after touchdowns.
Earlier in the week, the Oilert
lost to the AI’D’s, 19-12, in 1
game that deadlocked twice, and
had to be decided by an overtime
period.

Contrary to most of the games
played recently, this was one game
which saw oneplayer, John Chaffo,
of the ,APD seven, steal the show,
and personally be the difference be-
tween defeat and victory for his
team. '

Trophy    

_ A football trophy, to be presented to the winner of the annual.Pitt-
Techigame, and an attempt to ﬁnish construction work on the eighth
floor were discussed at one of the longest meetings of Student-Faculty

association Wednesday night.

Ed Tait, C42, vice-president of the group, conducted the meeting

in the absence of the president, Roy Ruane, C42. _
A committee, headed by Edward Byers, C43, was appointed to con-
tact -the president of the Carnegie Student council regarding the foot-
ball trophy. Suggestions for the award included exchange of a goalpost

for bell with space provided for the name of the annual winner and the

An “unofficial trophy,” a goalpost of the 1938 game, exchanged

hands that year following Tech’s victory‘ over Pitt and the “Dream
Backfield" by the score of 20-10. Captured on the Monday following
the game, the goalpost was carried to the front of Scobell hall on the
Tech campus and imbedded in steel reinforced concrete.
Although attempts were made ‘by Pitt students to recapture the
prize, the post remained at Tech until the following year when the Pan-
t-hers scored a victory over the Tartans and regained the trophy.

‘ . .Theodoi'e Biddle, acting Dean

of Men, has been attempting for

some time to have the eighth floor const_r_ucti_on work completed. Accord-_
ing to Tait, the ﬂoor, housing all publication oﬂices, YMCA, dean of

men’s office, and the men’s tuck shop, probably is used by more students’
for‘ activities than any other part

of the University. ‘ If the "work i-s

started, th men’s tuck shop maybe moved to the present location of the

~“_i_>ld” tuck shop, Tait said.
