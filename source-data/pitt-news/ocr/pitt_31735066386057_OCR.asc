Pitt's new president will need
the “qualities of a saint,” according
to Trustee Farrell Rubenstein, the
newly appointed chairperson of
the presidential search committee.

“You get a university as
complex as Pitt and you have an
undergraduate student body, a
graduate student body, a faculty,
an alumni group, a community
group, a Pittsburgh business
group, the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania., the. city of
Pittsburgh, and you need
somebody that can deal with all
those things," Rubenstein said.

“That is a person that’s got to

Over Ioalf of Pitts black students drop out each year

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

The University of Pittsburgh fails
to retain 64 percent of its African-
American students each year,
according to a report issued by
the Senate StudentAffairs Council

in June.

Cited in the report as reasons
for the high drop-out rate were
low grades, experiences of racial
prejudice, family problems,
reduced financial aid and
unhappiness with the social and
academic atmosphere at Pitt.

The drop-out rate among white
Pitt students is 32 percent -—— half
that of African-American students.
Approximately 9 percent of Pitt
students are African Americans.

“These are proven students,”

said Black Action Society
Chairperson Doug Ligons. Their
acceptance to college is proof of
their academic ability, he said.

“I think [the administration
shows] very limited concern with
the black community. Anytime
that half —— I mean, not even half
— the students in a given area
are graduating in a five—year
period, [...l tl1at’s a cause for
alarm,” Ligons said.

“Just because [Posvarl says, ‘Oh,
yeah, we want more black
students here, and we want more
black students to graduate’ --
not [only] Posvar, but anybody
who has been here that long i...)
— doesn’t mean that they
necessarily mean that, you know?
I mean, they can pretend to be
concerned because that’s their

job," he said.

“But, you know, a lot of people
say, ‘Yeah, I'm going to do this
and I'm going to do that, and I’m
concerned about this and that,’
and then you really can tell by
-their actions,” he said.

According to Associate Director
of Admissions William N unn, Pitt's
drop-out rate can be attributed in
part to the lack of African-
American role models at the
university.

In the ﬁeld of education, many
black and female role models are
being taken off into industry, and
“education is being left high and
dry,” he said.

“If you look at the black-
graduation rate, you find that
black students do better at black
schools,” Nunn said. “Why is it

those students seemingly do well
academically lat black schoolsl?"

People frequently say that

African-American schools are
easier, that they provide more of
a social environment, and that
the students are more in tune
with academics, according to
Nunn. But he cited another
explanation.

V “Historically, black schools
mimic home life more than any
of the other schools do. Where is
the one place where an individual
can be themselves without being
characterized?” he asked.

“That doesn’t mean that
institutions must mimic home,
but I think for any youngster —
regardless of race, color, creed or
religion —— we have to be sensitive
to those obstacles that are going

to be present,” Nunn said.

“I think we have to teach
youngsters when they come
through those doors where to go
for help, how to put your best
foot forward,” he said.

In March, Nunn initiated the
“Be a Signiﬁcant Other” program
because "students in high school
need someone significant in their
lives,” he said _

The theory behind the program
was “intervention for retention,”
Nunn said.

The program began with a
meeting of about 15 student-
organization leaders.

“The response
overwhelming,” he said.

Nunn then obtained the names
of students who were
participating in -the Office of
Student Affairs Excel program,
many of whom agreed to work
on the “Be a Significant Other”

program.

After a second meeting,
participants attempted to establish
relationships through letters and
telephone calls to African-
American high-school students
who had expressed interest in
attending Pitt, Nunn said.

“Some [Pitt students] invited
[these high-school students] to
go to their classes or go on a
campus tour,” he said.

According to Nunn, programs
like these are necessary because
the‘ needs of African-American‘
freshmen and transfer students
are different from those of other

W88

, students.

“I know that the support
systems that black students need
become almost obvious, ” he said.

“They have different needs,”

E he said. “It's not that you treat

them differently. You need to
serve their individual needs.”

For the past four years the
Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid has held an annual
summer information program for
African-American students
interested in attending Pitt.

This year the program, held
July 26 and 27, was expanded
with the help of the “Be a
Significant Other” program. About

100 students from 15 different“

states participated, according to
Nunn.

Students and their parents
stayed in the dormitories and
participated in tours, workshops
and socials and heard speakers,
including Provost Donald
Henderson.

On the first day, program
organizers issued a questionnaire
asking students and their parents
what they hoped to get out of the
program.

Students said they wanted to
know more about scholarships
and athletics. “We adjusted the
second day accordingly,” Nunn
said.

“The response we got was that
the program was extremely
profitable," he said. “Not every
school will take this kind of time. "

“The Excel program is a support
service for incoming black
freshmen,” according to Assistant
Coordinator Donna Walker.

Through the Excel program,

The national decline of
18- to 22-year-old college
applicants has not affected
the size of Pitt’s incoming
freshman class, according
to university officials.

The 1990 freshman class
is being projected at 2,585;
2,150 of these have enrolled
in the College of Arts and
Sciences, with the School
of Engineering and School
of Nursing registering 350

figure is increased from last

Recruiting targets out of state students

By Mike Ertl
For the Pin News

In today’s competitive higher
education market, recruiting
prospective students has taken
on a new priority for college
administrators. ‘

According to Dr. Betsy Porter,
Pitt’s director of freshman

admissions, the university will
spend more than $250,000 for
recruitment purposes this year,
not including staff salaries or the
cost of assistance from other
departments.

This budget funds everything
from the hundreds of different
brochures that Pitt mails out to
videotapes to recruitment trips

around the country, according to
Porter.

“Pitt probably came slightly late
to the recruiting game,” said
Porter, acknowledging that like
many other schools Pitt didn’t
consider it necessary to actively
recruit while there was still a
large pool of prospective students
to draw from. She said it wasn’t

Pitt's enrollment of older students

By Kristene M. A. Bondi
Stajf Writer

The number of non—traditional
students — older students who
have little or no previous college
experience —— has decreased at
the University of Pittsburgh.

According to John O. Bolvin,
College of General Studies dean,
“Older students’ enrollment has
decreased with the decrease in
the economic condition in this
region.” , ’

Of the 15,049 students enrolled
in CGS, approximately 3,000 are

non—traditional. Bolvin said, “The
average age of the [CGS] student
has dropped. More of the CGS
students get jobs and enter college
right out of high school.” This
too is due to economic conditions
in this region.

Dean Bolvin added that 16 to
17 percent of the CGS students
use employee benefits to help
pay for college.

Of the more than 22,000
employees of Pitt only “500 use
employee education benefits for
themselves or their spouses,” he
said. University employees

 

currently pay $5 per credit for
undergraduate classes for
themselves and their families.

Barbara Kleist, a non—traditional
student who is taking advantage
of the employee education
benefits said, “It was not
economically feasible for me to
continue attending Chatham. My
plan was to get a job at Pitt so that
I could take advantage of the
employee beneﬁts.”

Barbara Rich, a non-traditional
student who is currently in her
senior year said, “The employee
educational benefits will help me

until Pitt was looking at a ten
percent decline in freshman
enrollment in 1977 that
recruitment was made a high
priority, and it has escalated in
importance every year since then.

According to Porter, there has
been a significant decline in the
number of available students in

See Recruit, page A-27

decreasing

obtain my graduate degree if I
stay employed at Pitt.”

Both Kleist and Rich are former
housewives who needed an
education to obtain a job that
would support them after their
divorces.

“Before, most CGS graduates
were looking to move up in their
current employment. Now most
are in service positions — dead-
end jobs,” Bolvin said.

According to the 1990 Board of
Visitors Report, of the CGS
graduates from 1989, “71 percent
were seeking new employment.”

    

Aid, officials were able to Tim Moses
- - Computer Science
forecast the decline in the Vanderbmummity

student pool as early as the
mid 1970s. In 1980, the
university began what
Porter called an “aggressive
recruitment campaign” in
which it looked increasingly
outside of Allegheny
County and Pennsylvania
for prospective students.
Pitt now actively recruits
students in 14 states other
than Pennsylvania. 9

“We feel that we have to
do our business directly to
the smdent and the family,”
said Porter. Some of the
recruitment techniques that
are being used are an
increased ﬂow of direct mail
to the homes of prospective
students, pre-planned visits
to other regions outside the
Pittsburgh area, and

university experienced an
increase in applications of
about 25 percent in 1988,
when many other schools
were experiencing a
decline. “It was a
combination of good things
that happened for us in
that year we were
fortunate that ithappened,”
said Porter, adding that in
her opinion one of the main
reasons for the
unanticipated increase was
that Pitt got an early jump
on recruiting in other
regions.

The increase in applicants
that year led to an apparent
increase in the overall

If greed and insensitivity have
earned the legal profession this
reputation, the Pitt Legal Incomes
Sharing Fund is trying to change
this perception by offering
students in the Graduate School
of Law the opportunity to explore
public-interest law.

Alicia Hawkins, PLISF’s
treasurer, said the program's goal
is that “students who participate
recognize that there is a need for
students to go into public-interest
work." She said the major setback

is that this type of law doesn’t
garner large paychecks. ,

Hawkins said the idea behind
PLISF is that interested students
are referred to public-interest legal
groups. As well, motivated
students can receive grants to
start their own legal programs to
aid the public.

Two first-year law students,
Michael Milch and Sondra Miller,
did just that. With funding raised
by PLISF, the two created the Pitt
Legal Committee for Soviet
Refugees, to handle legal troubles
new immigrants face.

After recruiting approximately
20 Pittsburgh attorneys to
volunteer with the committee,
Milch and Miller were given a
$3,000 grant at the beginning of
this summer and since then have

helped about 20 refugees with
legal problems ranging from
immigration woes to landlord
disputes.

Milch said that both his and
Miller’s backgrounds in
community work attracted them
to the program. His own religious
convictions made the service
especially appealing. He said, “III
wanted to work with law to help
[Soviet] Jewry.”

Miller explained that the nature
of the Soviet Union politically
places the country’s immigrants
in a special category. They are
given unique categorization and
quotas, which are established
yearly by the president of the
United States.

“When we deal with Soviet.

we don’t deal with immigration
in that respect. If they want to
bring over their relatives, we can
help them with that, although
primarily what we’ve been doing
now is [helping] with a whole
range of problems,” she said.

Attorney Barbara Bower, one
of the volunteers, is working
with a Soviet refugee who wants
to stay in the United States with
her husband, an immigrant
himself, while her application
for permanent visa is processed.
Bower said this can take up to
two years and is petitioning that
the woman be allowed to remain
here with her child while the
application is reviewed.

Miller said a refugee can remain
in the United States if he or she
can “prove a fear of persecution. "

The refugee’s conversion to

Judaism in this case has the

woman worried about her safety
in the Soviet Union.

A similar concern of refugees is
their eligibility for social-welfare
benefits. Joel Pfeffer, an attorney
volunteer, said, “A number of
attorneys had received inquiries
from social-welfare agencies, and
they were looking for a way to
deal with these problems.”

Refugees are sponsored by the
government financially for their
first four months in America;
however, this doesn’t give them
any pocket money. If they are
unable to find work after this
period, it is necessary they
understand the benefits to which
they may be entitled. This is
“heavy in their minds,” according
to Pfeffer.

Other day—to—day woes of
refugees are disputes they may
enter over contracts they signed
but don’t understand. The most
common of these involve
landlord—tenant arrangements.
Pfeffer pointed out that some
refugees don’t understand that if
they sign a contract, they are
beholden to the terms of the
contract and it can be enforced

Pitt students like sophomore John McKotc

of $350 on textbooks this year.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 27. 1990

By Suzanne Sabol
stag Writer

Pitt students’ ﬁnancial resources
will be tested this fall due to the
tuition increase and a doubled
computer fee. Once these
expenses are met, students will
face yet another high cost: the
price of textbooks.

Although textbook prices
haven’t increased signiﬁcantly
from last year, the average
freshman will still spend $350 for
books this year, said Pitt’s director
of book centers, Mary Bonach. _

“The prices are outrageous,”
said Pittsenior Brian Yobst. “One
of my books is $72.”

Tanya Sheffield, also a senior,
said, "I think the university should
help the students more. They get

- enough money from us in tuition.

They don’t have to take so much

at the bookstore, too.”
However, as employees of the

bookstore have said, the

h will spend an average prices ‘

“Book prices are determined

by the publishers,” said book
center employee Kirk Dahlberg.
“If students are upset about prices,
the bookstore can’t do anything
about it.”

The bookstore gets texts at a
discount from the publisher, then
sells them at the publisher’s list
price, said Dahlberg.

Bonach said that Pitt sticks to a
25 percent markup rate on texts,
except on small paperbacks,
which may be slightly more.

According to another bookstore
source, the actual markup
percentage can be found encoded
on a book’s price sticker. Using
the letters SCRAMBLEDX as a
code for the numbers 1-0, a two-
digit code is printed next to the
price, referring to the discount
and subsequent proﬁt per book.

The proﬁt from book sales goes
to pay employees and buy next
terms’ books only, because the
Pitt bookstore is a nonprofit
organization, said Bonach.

According to Bonach, the book
center is actually able to offer
better prices on books, due to the

textbook seller.

“Because we have nonproﬁt
status, we don’t have to charge
sales tax. For students, that’s a 6-
percent discount off the price of
books,” she said.

Many students say that this 6
percent just isn’t enough.

“I’m a senior industrial engineer,
and I really feel that engineers
get taken advantage of on every
side. Our tuition is higher, and
just about every engineering book
is over $50,” said Chris Mays.

Bonach acknowledged that
technical books are expensive,
but she said that “the department
is the one that chooses the
textbook. The value of the book
is decided by them.”

Pitt students have also
complained about used-book
policy, and the fact that books for
common classes often change
from one semester to the next,
eliminating book buybacks.

“Your friends will take a course,
then you’ll take it the next
semester and a new edition of the
same book will be in the
bookstore as the required text.
You can’t use the old book, even
though it has very few changes,”
said Pitt student Vicki Behanna.

Bonach said that book changes
are the faculty's prerogative. “The
publishers come in and show
their new books to the
department. You have to give the
faculty the privilege of changing
the required textbook.”

Bonach also attributes the
inconsistent book buybacks to
relations with the faculty. “When
the department isn’t sure how
many sections are being offered,
or which professors are teaching
courses, they can’t turn in their
book lists. We can’t take a risk
and buy back a book that won't
be used. We can’t afford to keep
those" books and tie up dollars

- and cents that way.”

Junior Becky Myer said, “I know
the bookstore can’t help the books
chosen; the professors pick them.
But the bookstore does know
you have nowhere else to go to
sell back your books, and they
give you peanuts for them.”

Used books are bought back at
half of the current price, and are
marked up to 75 percent of the
current price and resold. Bonach
said that the 25-percent markup
is charged for taking the risk of
buying back books that might
not sell, and for sorting and re-
pricing the texts.

Students who want to sell their
books say that the bookstore
doesn’t give them the best value.
“You only get half of your money
back. Everybody gets a better
deal when students sell their
books to other students,” said
senior Nicci Liller.

However, Bonach advocates
keeping your textbooks as a
reference. “You should keep your
books; they're very valuable. You
should remember that books’
costs aren’t as high as other things
you need to go to college, like
tuition and room and board.
Books are the cheapest things in
your education.”

College life A makes students susceptible to addictions

By Randy T. Legersky
For The Pitt News

College students are easily
susceptible to many addictions,
according to Silvija Singh, a
counselor at the University
Counseling Center.

“We have many students who
do come in with drug and alcohol
problems. There are other
addictions as well. Sometimes
students over—exercise, have an
addiction to work or to a romantic
partner,” said Singh.

Underground cult hero and
life-long heroin addict William S.
Burroughs observed in his
biography Literary Outlaw that
“the withdrawal pains from love
are comparable to kicking junk.”

One may never think of love as

being addictive, but actually
anything. that gives pleasure or
alleviates the pain of mundane
living can develop into an
addiction, wrote Burroughs.

According to a Feb. 20

Newsweek article, many factors
contribute to the development of
an addiction. Many people can
go through life without falling
into an addiction problem even
though they may experiment for
a long time with drugs and
alcohol.

Some addicts have low self-
esteems and want to escape, while
others are reckless and anti-social.
A basic personality mold cannot
be used effectively to identify an
addict. Both internal and external
factors go into the composite
forces that shape addictive

behavior. Personality,
environment, genetics and social
acceptability all contribute to
making an individual susceptible
to an addictive lifestyle, according
to the Newsweek article.

The article explains that many
addicts have a history of violence
and aggression. When they are
exposed to narcotics, such as
opiates or barbiturates, they find
that they feel “normal,” more
mellow and patient. However,
people with lethargic
personalities, or hyperactive
people who want to keep on-the-
go, are more susceptible‘ to
cocaine abuse.

Environment has a tremendous
inﬂuence in determining who will
develop an addiction, according
to Pete Johnson, a Gateway

counselor who works with
alcoholics and drug addicts in
the Pittsburgh area. Gateway is a
drug and alcohol rehabilitation
center in Pittsburgh.

“I think there is probably some
kind of genetic factor that
predisposes a person to chemical
imbalances thatwould then cause
them to become dependent
chemically, but I don’t think that’s
the big reason for people getting
into drugs at all; and that’s
certainly not the reason. The
bigger factor is the environmental
factor, including how a person is
raised from birth until the time
when he gets out on his own,"
Johnson said.

“A kid who grows up and has
parents who help him to develop
a good, healthy self-image will

most likely not get into drugs,"
he said. “He may experiment,
but he’ll realize very quickly what
he wants out of life.

“Many addicts may not be able
to experience pleasure in normal
ways [and thereforel‘ turn
anything they do [that is]
pleasurable into a compulsive
obsession. Whether it be
gambling, sex, overeating or
drugs, they are looking for instant
gratification. Most likely the
environment of the compulsive/
obsessive in childhood was one
where the individual never
obtained a reward for his efforts
to please his parents," said
Johnson.

Johnson used the example of a
boy whose father wants him to

In the little over a year that

' Donald Henderson has spent in

his post, Pitt’s first black provost
has won the respect of students,
faculty and administrators alike.

“[Henderson] is not the kind of
person who sort of just leaves
you out there by yourself when

you have to make a difficult

decision. He is there _for you,”

B said eAssociate Provost Jack

Daniel. “His willingness to listen
to me about things over which
we disagree is not just something
that is just with me; it is something
that I know is operative with
other people.”

Henderson took over as provost
in April of 1989, after the
resignation of Rudolf H.
Weingartner. Instead of engaging
in the usual lengthy search
process to fill Weingartner’s post,
Pitt President Wesley Posvar
opted to immediately appoint

-.Henderson, who had served as

associate provost since 1976.

“Strong, courageous
forthright — those are the words
that leap to my mind about him,
not just in his work but in a
personal sense also,” Posvar said.

Weingartner resigned over a
disagreement with Posvar over
the role the provost should have

and _

in Pitt’s budgeting process.
Because Henderson was
chosen without a formal search,

 (2&A: Pitt’s provost reflects on problems during first year

provost was formally confirmed
at June’s Board of Trustees
meeting.

“He seems to be comfortable
in his position.  It’s like you
know that he’s not a stuffed shirt
or someone who ‘just comes in
and does his job and leaves and
that’s it. I mean, his attitude is
very caring,” said Student
Government Board President
Julie Shepard. '

Henderson received a Ph.D. in
sociology at Pitt in 1967. Before
returning to Pitt, he was an
administrator at Southern Illinois
University and director of
research at United Pharmacology
in Washington, D.C.

You received your doctorate
at Pitt in 1967. Where have
you seen the university go
since then? ‘ 1
It’s grown enormously since I
was a student here, both in terms
of the scope of its offerings on
the one hand and the quality of
the programs. The sheer size of
the place is just staggering and
the research undertaking, for
example, within the institution is
just enormously greater than was
the case here in every area of the

« institution. The size of the student

body, I think, has grown both in
size and in quality. There is no
question that the medical
complex is light years away from
where it was when I was here.

 

Being the first black provost
at the university, how does
that, if at all, change your
responsibility to the black
student at Pitt, affirmative
action and the Black Action
Society?

I have both a personal and a
institutional interest in furthering
the goals of diversity within the
institution; diversity is a
euphemism for affirmative action
and equal opportunity.

I'd like to see greater
opportunities for blacks and other
minorities within the definition
of that term. We have tended
over the years to lag so far behind"
and one of the swiftest routes to
mobility within this society is
through education. I am
particularly concerned that the
opportunities for blacks and other
minorities havetaken a downturn
over the last decade or so, and
I’m alarmed by it.

At the same time I think, given
the character of our society,

unless diversity characterizes both _

the makeup and the processes of
an institution like this, then the
people who work here are
shortchanged, particularly
students, because students are
going to live and preside in the

future over a world that is quite

different from what was the case
when I was a kid. The world’s

Cutting—edge medical research brings Pitt global acclaim

By Jenifer Crook
News Editor .

A glance in the help-wanted ads will confirm what high
school guidance counselors are stressing to America's up-
and-coming workforce — the medicai field is the fastest
growing industry in the United States.

Nowhere is this rapid expansion more apparentthan at the
University of Pittsburgh, 
wherethe Medical and Health
Care Division (MHCD)
continually increases its
facilities and staff, striving to
maintain and increase its
global recognition. MHCD
now employs 12,000 health
care officials.

In the'April 30 edition of
U. 8. News and World Report,
two Pitt-managed hospitals,
Children's and Presbyterian-
University, were cited as
among the nation’s best in
pediatrics and neurology and
otolaryngology, respectively.
However, those aren’t the only
areas of acclaim. ‘

“We have the largest '
transplant program in the
world,’T boasts Jane Duffield,
director of the university’s
Health Sciences News Bureau. Transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas
Starzl and his colleagues now perform an average of one
transplant every 12 hours —— more than any other institution in
the world.

Global acclaim has also been given to Pitt’s Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. Touted as one of the leading
psychiatric hospitals in the nation, “it’s now the world leader
in depression research,” said Duffield.

Affiliated with several other Oakland medical facilities —-
Eye and Ear Hospital, Falk Clinic, the Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute, Montefiore Hospital, the Veteran's Administration
Hospital and Magee Women’s Hospital —the MHCD has also
given Pitt the impetus to become a major research institution.
The university’s 1990 research budget now surpasses $120
million. '

While many Pitt research-
ers continue to plug away in
the more conventional areas,
others are developing some
of the newest branches of
medical research. One of
those cutting-edge areas is a

gene therapy.

With this therapy, corrective
genes may someday be used
to cure an inheirited disorder
such as muscular distrophy.

      
  

For cancer treatment,
components of a patient’s
immune system may be
removed and treated in a way
that will boost their potency,
and then reinjected into the
body.

Although it is near-certainty
that many experiments and Dr‘ Eric Hoffman
gene therapy can become standard treatment, if it does, Pitt
officials have recently expressed hopes to bring gene therapy
here within two years. in preparation, leading, genetic
researchers are being recruited to join Pitt's medical team.
One of them is Dr. Eric Hoffman.

As he looks out of ‘his 12th floor office window in the
Biomedical Science Tower, Eric Hoffman explains that it was
job security, not the scenic view of downtown Oakland, which
lured him from a research position at Harvard Medical School
to the University of Pittsburgh three months ago.

‘‘I’m an employee of Pitt,” said Hoffman. “A lot of hospitals
like Harvard won't make you an employee —that’s called soft
money research. My entire existance at the insititution was
based on my ability to get research grants to pay my salary and
basically pay ‘rent’ to Harvard for using their equipment.

"Here at Pitt at least I'm an employee. That security fosters
an attitude of commitment [from you] to the institution and the
[from the] institution to you. Who needs the stress of always
begging for grants?’ Hoffman pauses and then laughs, “At
least now I don't have to go home and beat the kids to get the
stress out.‘ I

With his laid-back manner and casual dress, joking seems
to come easily to Hoffman. But in the field of Duchenne
Muscular Distrophy research, Hoffman’s accomplishments
are no laughing matter.

Hoffman is credited with identifying the defective gene
which causes this genetic neuromuscular disease which

strikes nearly one in every 3,000 young boys, almost always .

killing its victims before the age of 20.

Laboratory work is the foundation of medical research.

"lt's one ofthe most importantgenetic diseases because it's
so common,” said Hoffman, who explained that Duchenne
affects males almost exclusively because of its chromosomal
linkage.

Patients who are afflicted with Duchenne have defective
genes which are unable to manufacture dystrophin, a vital
muscle protein. This type of malfuction is not uncommon in
genetic diseases. ‘

"Almost all genetic diseases are a lack of whateverthe gene
makes,” said Hoffman.

Although Duchenne MD has been recognized since about
1800, progress in treating the illness was limited, since
researchers weren’t sure what exactly they were up against.

"They’d been trying for years to figure out what’s missing in

these Duchenne patients, but nobody could
' find out what’s wrong.”

Nobody, that is, until Hoffman entered the

scene. Three years ago, while working at

66Here at Pitt- at least I'm
an employee. That security
fosters an attitude of

committment to the ~
institution and [from the]

institution to you. Who
needs the stress of always

begging for grants?”

—Dr. Eric Hoffman

Harvard, Hoffman decided to try a different
approach. Instead of taking the standard
research route of looking through the tissue
to find the missing protein, Hoffman started
by examining the core of the problem —the
gene itself. ,

"Duchenne MD is the first example of successfully using
reverse genetics. Now that's what everyone is keying on in
molecular biology," he said.

in order to identify the missing protein, Hoffman first took
tiny pieces of the defective gene and'by using molecular
biology, constructed bacteria to replicate the gene's protein
formula, or messenger RNA.

He then injected the bacteria into sheep, whose immune
systems identified the bacteria as foreign and produced
antibodies to attack them.

“Then I used the antibodies for detection, because they'll
seek out the protein wherever it is. And that was it, we named
the protein dystrophin."

Although Hoffman is credited withthe discovery, he is quick
to acknowledge his colleagues for completing the difficult
basework of locating where the defective gene lies within the
chromosome. "That’s the really hard part,” he said.

Now that the protein is identified, the challenge of treatment
remains. One possible optionwould be to somehow get
dystrophin from another source, either synthetically orthrough
healthy donors, and inject it into patients.

“The problem is that these Duchenne patients need

dystrophin in every muscle in their body ——we would have to 1

stick needles in them everywhere,” said Hoffman.

Hoffman continues his research into muscular distrophy
through grants from the Muscular Distrophy Association.
Although his career was chosen somewhat by accident —-— "l
was a 99 percent music major and a one percent biology major
at [Gettysburg] College. When I got out, graduate schools
were really hurting for biology students, so it cost me almost
nothing financially,” — he has never regretted the decision.

After completing his Ph.D. in biology at John Hopkins

University in 1986, Hoffman went to Harvard. in addition to his,

research at Pitt, he currently serves as an assistant professor
at the school of medicine in the department of Molecular
Genetics and Biochemistry.

In searching for better cancer treatments, researchers at
the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute are focusing on |efting"'the
body’s own immune system take its course in fighting the
disease —"with a little help from science. _

By using naturally-occurring or synthetic biochemical
substances, called biological response modifiers, researchers
at PCI are giving patients’ immune systems a boost, making
them more potent in attacking cancerous cells.

"These agents help augment the body’s own immune
responses.” said PCl’s Coordinator of Pharmacy Services
Rowena Schwartz. ‘'It helps the body fight cancer. Usually the
BRMs are drugs that are already present in the body and
they’.re given in such a way to boost their affect.”

Unlike traditional treatments such as chemotherapy, which
is given systemically, or throughout the body, scientists are
focusing BRM treatment directly into the cancer—ridden areas.

''Instead of giving them through IVs, they are administered
usually through’ direct injection. So hopefully you get more
effect in that area with less side effects,” Schwartz said.

"There have been some responses to the treatments,” she
added. “A response in this type of study is very promising.”

The reason even minimal reactions bring hope to researchers
is that most of the patients who participate in BRM clinical trials
have exhausted all other treatment options, all of which failed
on them. * '

Schwartz said, “A lot of times patients with certain diseases
are nowhere nearterminal, but there's no other treatment for
them. So instead of just letting them go along, we can try to
intervene with their disease early on.”

In Phase I BRM clinical trials, health care practitioners must
tackle the basic questions, such as "determining the optimal
dose, schedule and route for administration of each agent, as
well as toxicity,” said Dr. John Kirkwood. PCl’s associate
director of ‘medical oncology.

Unlike chemotherapy, where the best dose is usually the
most a patient can safely handle, BRM data suugests that a
lower or even minimal dose may be more effective in aiding the
immune system, added Kirkwood. . _

Another treatment option currently being trialed combines
BRM therapy with standard chemotherapy and radiation.

Although PCl’s work with BRMs has made it one of the top
cancer centers in the world for BRM research, officials stress
that cures may still be a long way off.

One reason forthis is that researchers are struggling to find
ways to get BRMs into some presently inaccessible areas
where cancer grows. Also, the quantity of cancer cells almost
always outnumbers the BRMs that can currently be produced
to combat them. ‘ A »

‘‘It can be frustrating for patients because some of them are
scared and willing to try anything for a cure. We probably
cannot givethem that,” Schwartz said.

“But a lot of people who are participating in these trials feel
that they're doing it not to be cured, but maybe to help
somebody else on down the line.”

Schwartz stressed, however, that overall cancer cure rates
now surpass 50 percent, and a diagnosis no longer means a
definite death sentence for those afflicted.

“We went through that period like AIDS currently faces of
the disease being sofinal. But now, as radiation, chemotherapy
and surgery have been redefined, cancer is not incurable."

In times when smiles and positive words don't come easy,
Cynthia Klemanski urges HIV-positive individuals and AIDS
patients to keep hoping and dreaming.

"lt's really important to help people maintain hope,” said
Klemanski, administrative director of the Pittsburgh AIDS
Center for Treatment (PACT). “Now more than everthere are
reasons to have hope. People are living longer with AIDS and
there are more and more research findings every day.”

Around the world, leading researchershasten to find better
treatments and cures for Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome, which has claimed 83,145 American lives. More
than one million Americans are estimated to be infected by
HIV, the AIDS-causing virus.

Gay cruising causes concern for North Oakland residents

By Eric Hoch
For The Pitt News

Residents on Fillmore and
Winthrop Streets in North
Oakland want gay cruising to
stop on their streets because they
cannot sleep at night due tothe
noise caused by the cruisers.

Landlord Marshall Goodwin
claimed that he and his tenants
living in the area are not anti-gay,
just anti-cruising.

“All we want is peace and quiet
at night so we can get to sleep,”
said Goodwin. “This is not an
anti—gay issue. It doesn’t matter
who is driving around our
neighborhood beeping their
horns and yelling to each other.
It starts at 1 a.m. and keeps us up
the whole night, and we want it
to stop.”

According to Goodwin, the
situation could be handled simply
by putting up signs that would
say: “NO CRUISING ZONE, 12
midnight - 5 a.m.”

Goodwin said that the only
problem with this solution is that
Dan Cohen, the city councilman
for that area, has said he cannot
do that.

“He told us he couldn’t put up
the signs,” Goodwin said, “but I
went down to the county seat
library and found that under the
specific powers of department
and local authorities [Law
Administration and Enforcement],
he could.” .

Goodwin referred to a list of
police powers, particularly one
that gave the police the power of
“prohibiting or regulating the use
of designated streets by any class
or kind of traffic.”

Goodwin said that although
cruising in itself is not illegal, the
city could make it unlawful with
those signs.

Councilman Cohen was
unavailable for comment.

According to the South Craig
Street Association, a business

group from that area, thensigns ,_

would not hurt local businesses.

In a letter to Councilperson
Jack Wagner, the South Craig
StreetAssociation, earlier this year
stated that the “proposed traffic
limitation between 12 midnight

and 5 a.m. will impose no

hardship and will not interfere in

any way with the conduct of
' business by the merchants of the

South Craig Street area.”
Wagner, the president of City

Council, had no further comment.
As for the effectiveness of this

plan, Goodwin got the idea from

State College, where a similar L

problem was occurring.

According to Goodwin, it worked‘ T T

well in cutting down on the
cruising situation.

William Hileman, from the gay-
activist organization Cry Outl,
believes the sign is not the best
solution for the problem.

While he agrees that the cruisers
make too much noise for the
residents, he questions the
availability of places where gay
youth can go to be themselves
without getting hurt or being
ridiculed.

“Gays can’t meet anywhere else
but through cruising because of
homophobia,” Hileman said. “Just

last year, a gay person was bashed
in Schenley Park. People have
been knifed coming out of
Holiday la gay bar]. Although
cruising isn’t very safe either, it is
the only.way gay people can get
together.”

Randy Forester, another gay
activist, doesn’t believe there is a
need for the signs.

“The problems of beeping,
yelling and radio-playing by gay
cruisers are not the norm for
cruisers,” Forester said. “Those
problems do exist. There are
cruisers who do cause problems,
but they are the minority.”

Forester said that most cruisers
only drive and do not make
excessive noise. These drivers, in
his opinion, are not a problem.

“Driving around shouldn’t
make all that much noise,”
Forester said. “My sleeping pattern
is such that] sleep until 11 a.m.,
and I live near a bus lane. Ifl can
sleep through that, I can’t see
why the residents can’t sleep
through it either.” 4”

Pitt begins recycling  
project under state law

By Dominic Romeo
Staff Writer

By Sept. 26, the University of
Pittsburgh must begin a recycling
program in Order to comply with
Pennsylvania’s new recycling law.

Law 101 mandates communities
of. 10,000 or more persons to
initiate recycling programs to deal
with the growing problem of
environmental waste.

The university must choose at
least three items from the
following list of recyclable
materials to include in its program:
clear glass, colored glass,
aluminum, high-grade office
paper, newsprint, corrugated
cardboard, plastics, and steel and
bi—metal cans.

Bob Boyce, the associate vice
president of facilities management
for the university, said that
currently there are aluminum
cans, cardboard and what is called

. an “Office mix” ofpaper collected

from ‘Forbes Quad, Thackeray
Hall and Learning Research and
Development Center as a part of
a pilot program started in January.

Boyce said, “From January to
June we recycled 20,000 pounds
of paper and cardboard.” Boyce
also said that due to the large
scale of the university, other
buildings have had to be slowly
phased into the program.

Although the university has a
viable recycling program for the
administrative and other ofﬁce
buildings, it has yet to outline the
program that students living in
the resident halls will follow.
However, Gil Shaffer of Housing
and Food Services said that a
meeting with Facilities
Management is needed before
plans are made.

“Right now we are unable to
put any plan into effect until we

know where the drop-Off points
will be and how and when these
materials will be picked up,” said
Shaffer. A meeting is planned for
later this month.

For students living off—campus
in Oakland, the answers of what,
how and where are more clear.
These students will be
participating in the city of
Pittsburgh’s recycling program.
Pittsburgh has recently adopted
an ordinance requiring residents
to place all metal food and

beverage cans, glass bottles and .

plastic containers into blue
recycling bags for removal by
city contractors.

Beginning Sept. 24, students
will be required to place these
bags with their regular trash for
removal. Approximately One-
fourth of the city’s communities
will be in compliance with the
law by that date.

At the state level, the provisions
of Law 101 require that at least 25
percent of all municipal waste
and source—separated waste
generated . within the
Commonwealth be recycled by
Jan. 1, 1997. The law’s ‘immediate
goals, however, are to recycle 7
percent of the total waste stream
and 12 percent of the total Once
newspaper has been diverted
from the residential waste stream.

Mary Ellen Bolish, deputy press
secretary of the Department of
Environmental Resources, said
that the new law, passed in June
1988, should relieve some of the
pressures on the state’s shrinking
landfill sites.

Currently there are fewer than
80 of these landfills left in
Pennsylvania and the problem of
waste removal is still growing.
“Unless something is done we
will simply run out room [in such
sitesl,” Bolish said.

Probation
not always

the end

of college

By Jeff Tatusko
Senior Staﬂ‘ Writer

Even though academic
probation is a sign of problems
for students, it does not necessarily
signal the end of a college career.

Susan Leary, Director of Student
Records and Information Systems,
said that 56 percent of the students
on academic probation last year
are registered for classes this fall.
“Of 1155 CAS /students placed on
probation last year, 298 were off
after the fall semester and 119
more came at the end of last
year,” she said. She added that
only 8.8 percent of the CAS
population went 8 on probation
for last year.

Barbara Mellix, assistant to the

, dean of the College of Arts and

Sciences, said that students for
the most part have more than just
one term to bring up their grade-
point averages. “The dean’s office
checks students’ records at the
end of each academic year,” she
said, “so students in most cases

can have up to one full year to .

bring up their average.”

Mellix said that students go on
academic probation “when their
overall grade—point average falls
below 2.0.”

Mellix also said that there is
help for those students who want
it. “Students who want help with

‘ their studies can go to the Writing
Workshop [Room 501 Cathedral
of Learning] and the Learning
Skills Center [Room 311 William
Pitt Unionl,” she said. -

“If a student knows that he or
she has a problem in a certain
area, such as math, the student
should go to the Learning Skills
Center to keep from getting into
academic trouble,” she said.

Rosalyn Jones, a learning
specialist from the Learning Skills

Center, agreed. “More students»

should take advantage of the
center before they go on
probationary status,” she said.

Jones described the center as

’more than just a tutoring center.
“When a student comes in for
help,” she said, “we will analyze
what the student’s problem is.
Then we work one—on—one with
the student to help [him or her]
apply certain study techniques.”
She added that the center only
provides actual tutors in math for
classes up to Calculus 22.

“Students seeking actual tutorial
help should go to the subject
department and get help there.”

Jones said that there are more
than 50 people who work in the
center, including 25 professional
staff workers. “There is plenty of
help,” she said.

She also said that, although all
students are welcome to use the
center, there is a program geared
especially for incoming freshmen.
“The center is mainly for freshmen

habits,” she said. “We try to help
improve study habits, for the most
,r)art."

Campusbuildings tell more than just /oistory of Pitt

By Amy DiMarco
The Pitt News

The Pitt campus is a mosaic of
new and old buildings, with styles
ranging from the Gothic Cathedral
of Learning to the ultra-modern
design of the sculpture in Forbes
Quadrangle.

Cutting into the Oakland skyline
is the Cathedral of Learning, the
second tallest school building in
the world. Started in 1926, the 42-
story Gothic tower was completed
in 1937, just in time for Pitt’s
150th anniversary.

The Cathedral’s nationality
rooms, started soon after the
building was completed, are one
of Pitt’s main attractions.
According to figures from the
Cathedral Information Desk,
50,000 people take guided tours
of the nationality rooms each
year and an estimated 100,000
tour the rooms on their own.

Maxine Bmhns, director of
nationality rooms and
intercultural exchange programs,

1 said, “The decor of each classroom

is meant to reflect a country’s
ethnic heritage before the
founding of Pitt.” Money to
finance the construction of the 23
nationality rooms was raised by
different ethnic groups from
Allegheny County.

After each room was
completed, the ethnic group
remained an integral part of the
university by initiating other
programs, such as lectures,
exhibits and concerts, to instill
cultural traditions in students as
well as in the community.
According to Bruhns, many of
the scholarships available to Pitt
students studying abroad were
generated by these ethnic groups.

Resting in the shadow of the
Cathedral, Heinz Chapel is the
site of concerts, services and

ceremonies. I
Dedicated on Nov. 20, 1938,
Heinz Chapel houses stained-
glass windows that are among
the tallest in the world — 73 feet
high. The 23 windows are
comprised of a quarter of a million
pieces of glass, according to Heinz
Chapel information pamphlets.
Unlike more traditional Gothic
windows, historical as well as
biblical figures are portrayed; if
you look closely you can find
Florence Nightingale, Columbus,
Pocahontas and 316 other famous
people from all over the world.
Men and women are equally
represented in these windows.
Another aspect of the chapel is
that its organ, boasting a total of
5,954 pipes, is among the largest
in the state. A
“Many couples who met at Pitt
come back to the chapel to get
married. l...l We get reservations

Safety officials say university security up to par

By Kristene M. A. Bondi
Sla_[7'Wriler

Despite three occurrences of
rape in South Oakland over the
summer, various University of
Pittsburgh safety officials are
reassuring students that the
campus is relatively safe.

Gary Moses, assistant director
of public safety, explained that
the Litchﬁeld Towers, Pitt’s largest
dormitories, employ desk
attendants in the main lobby.
There is also a secondary security
desk where students must show
identiﬁcation to get into the
elevator area. Guests must
present a picture ID and be signed
in to the building.

In addition to these measures,
the towers have several other

security features. A tower
resident’s key will only open the
doors to his or her living unit.
Every three floors in the towers
are considered a single living
unit.

Also, the towers have a door
by the elevator on women's floors
which may only be opened by
the residents of that living unit.

“There is a security guard
[assigned to each dorm areal Who
makes rounds. The university
also has 24-hour police
coverage,” Moses said.

The Cathedral of Learning also
has a security guard and [21] police
officer assigned to it, according
to Moses.

The university recently added
additional lighting on some
campus streets.

Robert Boyce, associate vice
president of Facilities
Management, said, “Lighting on
the upper campus, O’Hara [Street]
and University Drive, was
improved last summer as an
added safety measure.”

Boyce also encouraged
students to use the emergency
phones that the university
maintains around campus. Sgt.
Charles Grier of Pitt’s public—safety
department, added that there are
200 emergency phones on
campus that students can use to
report “suspicious activity.” The
phone numbers for the campus
police are 624-2121 and 648-2121.

“Hillman Library is a good
example. It has phones on the
opposite sides of Forbes [Avenue]
and Bigelow [Boulevard]. On
[each] ﬂoor of the building there

is an emergency phone directly
across from the elevator,” Grier
said.

“The way the police department
can be most effective is if the
students, and every group for
that matter within the university
community, be our eyes and ears,”
he said. “In terms of suspicious
activity, for example, we welcome
these calls. We will come out and
investigate the suspicious activity;
and if it is criminal, we will make
the appropriate response.”

The university offers various
safety workshops throughout the
year, including the several that
are held during freshman
orientation. According to Boyce,
the university plans to hire a
director of environmental health
and safety by Sept. 1 to further
improve campus safety.

Safety Tips

The following is a list of
safety tips provided by Sgt.
Charles Grier and Pitt’s
department of public
safety: '

- Keep your door locked
even when you are in your
apartment or dorm room.

-Keep your keys in a

safe place. Have them
ready before you get to
your door.

-Avoid walking alone.

-Try to get a ride. The
campus bus anduniversity
shuttle provide safe rides
through Oakland.

-Look alert when
walking, and use main
streets.

-Keep purses tucked
securely under your arm;
don’t overburden yourself
with bundles.

-Women should take
extra precautions. Dress for
freedom of movement
(wear non-confining
clothes, comfortable shoes,
clothing not easy to grab,
etc.).

According to Grier,
students living off campus
should look for the
following safety features
in an apartment:

-The door should have
a peephole.

0 First- and second—ﬂoor
windows should be secure.

-Doors should have an

. anti-theft lock, which has a
1-inch throat.

-Women should put
their first initial and last
name on the mailbox so
that it is unclear whether a
male or female resides
there.

campus freshmen was 1024 with
85 percent finishing in the top
two-ﬁfths of their high school
class. This was a marked increase
over the previous class which
averaged 1010 on their SATs and
had 79 percent graduate in the
top quintile. g

The 1989 class scored an
average of 1027, a slight increase
over the previous class. Figures
for the 1990 class were not yet
available, but officials anticipate
that they will show similar scores.

“It looks like the quality of this

. class will be about the same as

last yearis,” said CAS Dean Mary
Briscoe. According to Briscoe,

, the quality of the freshman class
“"",is more

important than the
quantity.

“I don't think that we should
admit more students just for the
tuition income,” she said. “I think
we ought to admit the number
that we can reasonably teach.”

Briscoe said that one of Pitt’s
biggest advantages in recruiting
students is its $4,049 tuition rate
for two semesters, which she
deemed a bargain compared to
rates at many other schools. She
added that the incoming freshman
class in CA5 is slightly larger than
she had hoped it would be, even
though the increase from last
year’s class is small.

Jobs for recent grads scarcein Pittsburgh area

By Dana Fernandez
sum" Writer

Recent college graduates may
be discovering that finding
employment in Allegheny County

can be a difficult job in itself.
One of the reasons that recent
graduates can't find local
employment is . that many
experienced workers are willing
to take jobs at entry-level salaries

Continued from page A-5
which has been in effect since
last August, incoming African-
American freshmen are paired
with two mentors, an upperclass
student and a faculty or staff
member.

“Freshman get a chance to learn
something about Pittsburgh and
the university,” Walker said.

The African-American Fair,
sponsored annually by the Excel
program, features local minority
businesses, Pitt organizations and
media personalities. This year the
fair will be held Sept. 6.

Impact is an academic and
financial assistance program for
African-American students in the
School of Engineering.

“What we're geared to is trying
to interest minority students in
the engineering field,” said Vince
Costa, a recruiter and counselor
for Impact.

“We also have a six—week
program in the summer for
students who don’t quite make it
into the program but have
potential,” he said.

The summer Impact program
includes math, chemistry, physics,
computer-science and English-
writing courses, according to
Costa.

“Those students who pass their
courses will then be admitted
into the School of Engineering,"
he said.

“We started off with 30 students
at the beginning of this six—week
period, and [...l of those 30, 19
actually passed the courses; so
they’re admitted to the School of
Engineering,” Costa said.

“Those who are not successful
in the program are then referred
to the College of Arts and
Sciences,” he said.

According to Costa, Impact is
helping more African-American
students get into Pitt’s School of
Engineering. _

“Those who actually will

graduate is another concern that
we have,” he said.

The University Challenge for
Excellence Program identifies at-
risk students and provides them
with support senvices. A

UCEP helps students who are
having academic trouble with
College of Arts and Sciences
courses,'according to Gail Austin,
a UCEP staff associate.

Though UCEP students remain
members during all four years at
Pitt, freshmen and sophomores
are given more attention than
upperclass students, Austin said.

UCEP is not exclusively for
African-American students.
However, the program offers
scholarships, ranging from $ 1,000
to $4,000, to 30 of the most-
talented African-American
students at Pitt.

so they can live in Allegheny
County, according to Joe
Belechak of the Diocese of
Pittsburgh Job Placement/Job
Development Services. This, in
turn, eliminates many entry-level
positions —— often the only ones
new college grads can obtain.

Because of this, many recent
grads are forced to leave the’area
to get their experience. Many
then relocate to Allegheny
County. Belechak estimates that
75 percent of the graduates he
deals with who move out of
Allegheny County or
Pennsylvania are anxious to come
back. Belechak also says thejob
Placement/Job Development
Services receive requests from
about 150 graduates a year who
have previously looked for jobs
and been unsuccessful. However,
he adds, they only find
employment for about one in
four of them.

A survey given to baccalaureate
degree recipients at Pitt by the
Office of Management
Information and Policy Analysis
shows that in October 1988, 64.6
percent of the 1988 graduates
who responded to the survey
were working full time. But only
35.9 percent of _those were
working in Pittsburgh. Another
30.1 percent relocated outside of
Pennsylvania. . _

As of August 1989, 60.4 percent
of V the 1989 graduates who
responded were working full

 

time, with 43.2 percent of them
employed in Pittsburgh, and 31.3
percent working out of state.

Joseph Thomas Freilino, who
is a 1989 political science graduate
of Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, has gotten offers
out of town but does not want to
relocate outside of Allegheny
County.

Belechak also pointed out that
the difficulties do depend
somewhat on the graduate’s
major. He said that careers in
health care, social service and
technical careers are good in
Allegheny County, and that he
finds that graduates with degrees
in communications, economics
and high-school education have
more difficulty finding jobs in
this area.

A 6 percent tuition hike for
students and a 4 percent salary
hike for faculty in the ﬁscal year
1991 budget have yielded
discontent from both factions.

“Every year things get worse. It
seems the ﬁrst thing they turn to
when they need money is the
students. I don’t see why they
can’t milk someone else for
once,” said senior Tina Lopate.

The 6 percent hike applies for
in-state, full—time undergraduate
students, raising their tuition for
two semesters from $3,820 to
$4,049. Out—of-state
undergraduate and all graduate
students’ tuition was raised 10
percent.

“The hike for out-of—state

students is much too high,
especially when more and more
students are paying for their own
tuition, ” said Student Government
Board President Julie Shepard.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
said he doesn’t think the hike will
discourage graduate and out-of-
state students from coming to
Pitt.

“The students who come here
from out—of-state are very often
scholarship students, for whom
assistance is provided anyhow,
or graduate and professional
students, for whom there are often
fellowships and support, ” he said.
“At the level of professional study
[and] graduate study, our
competition includes the private
institutions. Tuition at that level is
a bargain. You know, tuition, lets
say, for the doctorate student in

English literature is a small fraction
of what it is, let’s say, at Princeton. ”

This year’s budget has been at
issue since February when Posvar
instituted a hiring freeze in
anticipation of a low state
appropriation. Then, Faculty of
Arts and Sciences department
chairpersons gave Posvar a vote
of no confidence, voicing their
anger over the time in which the
hiring freeze was instituted (after
aggressive recruiting efforts had
already begun). Now, after the
low appropriation has become a
reality, a low faculty pay raise is
the cause of concern in FAS.

“It’s like a slap in the face,” said
English professor Phil Wion,
president of the United Faculty.

Wion said that the 4 percent
increase for faculty salary funds
allotted is inadequate.

“With a 4.6 percent rate of
inﬂation, the 4.0 percent increase
represents a cut in real salaries,”
he said.

A resolution released by the
Senate Budget Policies committee
on the day that Pitt Trustees
passed the budget also expresses
discontent over the non-
maintenance of real salary.

“The committee is distressed,
dismayed and angered that the
administration l...] has chosen to
reject the principle of
maintenance of real salary for
satisfactory performance,” the
resolution stated.

Donald McBumey, chairperson
of the BPC, said that the
administration was “paying lip
service” to the Senate by listening
to their recommendations and
then rejecting them.

Students and faculty outraged by 1991 Pitt budget ,

“They could have told us in
advance that they weren’t going
to listen to us. It makes a mockery
of the whole senate process,” he
said.

Although the administration

also increased fringe benefit funds ‘_
for faculty by 3 percent, McBumey ‘

said that did little to help the
situation.

“The increase in fringe benefits
doesn’t mean anything because
you can’t spend it. Besides, they
had to do that in order to keep up
with things like social security
increases,” he said.

Faculty salaries and student :

tuition weren’t the only things
affected by the low state
appropriation. Posvar has been
cutting back in several other
university offices, including
athletics and administrative
offices.

“Well, I hasten to point out that
we were cut——— or we cut ourselves

[the president’s office] — a higher 

percentage than anyone else,
three hundred thousand dollars.
And that mainly entailed the
elimination of the office of the
vice president for public affairs
and the elimination of the office
of the secretary,” Posvar said.
Posvar said that in the future
the university might have to

reduce the scale of some of its ,9

programs in order to compensate
for low state funding.
McBumey agreed that the
university needed to plan ahead
to avoid future budget problems.
“We feel that the university"
needs to make some serious long
term changes in priority, ” he said.
“There are things like buyouts
of football coaches that could

buy an awful lot of noticeable“ ’

raises. ”

Continued from page 6
against them.

He added that this problem is
further complicated when
refugees are unable to understand

that they can negotiate contractual _\
agreements. “It’s the collective
judgement [of immigration
attorneys] that we’ve got to
impress upon these people things
can be negotiated,” he said. “You
don't have to sign your name to
something that’s in front of you.
You can negotiate the terms of
your lease, the terms of your
employment contract and the ,
terms of [many] things you sign.” 
Attorney Robert Whitehill said,
“By and large [refugees] come
with what they can carry in a
suitcase. Also they come with
questions, confusion, vigor and
enthusiasm. " The committee says
it is vital refugees know the basics
of American life to keep this
enthusiasm from turning sour.
Part of this learning comes from ‘
‘ community and religious groups
‘ who deal with refugees. Miller
and Milch said that this has been
the key to the committee ’s success
and that it must continue if the
program is to continue.

Many incoming freshmen will
soon realize that the various
distractions of dorm life can
make studying even more
challenging than it already is.

Contrary to what most people
may think, the library isn't
always the best place to study
either —— at least not the first
ﬂoor of Hillman Library. Rumor
has it that the first floor has
been nationally ranked as one
of the best places to meet

someone of the opposite sex.

So where do Pitt students go
to seriously study? The fourth
floor of Hillman seems-to be a
good place, and the Cathedral
of Learning lawn is always filled
with students studying on a
nice day. The lounges in the
William Pitt Union are a popular
place, along with the Commons
Room in the cathedral.

The students who live in off-
campus housing seem to prefer
going home to study.

Pitt also has several smaller
libraries that students can use

Hillman not the only Study spot

to escape noisy dorms, such as
the ones in the following
buildings: Alumni Hall,
Benedum Hall, Cathedral of
Learning, Old Engineering Hall,
Frick Fine Arts, Langley Hall,
Law School Building, Library
and Information Science
Building, Mervis Hall, Music
Building, Public Health, Scaife
Hall, Stephen Foster Memorial,
Thackeray Hall, Victoria
Building and Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.
The Carnegie Library can also
be used by Pitt students.

the younger ranks, he'll try to round it out, "
he said o

It has not yet been determined how the
student members will be chosen, but
Rubenstein said that there will probably be

an election or they will ask the Student
Government Board to identify students.

The committee will also employ a
professional search consultant.

“The search firm is to help the search
committee; it is not to be the search
committee,” Rubenstein said. “If we, the
search committee, properly utilize the
search firm we think that they will bring a
lot to the table by way of guidance and

good advice and good support.”

While Posvar will not be part of the
search committee, Rubenstein said that he
will play a vital role in the search for the
new president.

“His [Posvar’sl advice and counsel will
be very important. Given Dr. Posvar’s
knowledge of academia, knowledge of
the university and a lot of other things, it
would be foolish not to communicate with

him,” he said.

Rubenstein said that once the committee
is assembled, which should be announced
on September 25, it will set up a criteria‘

and "a job description and begin advertising

the position around the country.

“We will look every place. That includes
within the university and outside of it,”
Rubenstein said.

Pennsylvania over the last ten to eleven
years, and those figures aren’t likely to
improve anytime soon. Because of this,
Pitt is making a much more concerted
effort to attract more students from out of

state.

“You either try to get more for less if you
stay within the boundaries of Pennsylvania
or you attempt to bolster the decline with
people from other markets,” said Porter.
“We can't just sit back and depend upon
students from the state of Pennsylvania. 
It wouldn’t fill our freshman class.”

She said the most viable markets outside

the state are those within a 300 mile radius
of Pittsburgh, and that two or three Pitt
staff members might visit 20 to 30 high
schools per week in a certain area. During
these visits they meet in group sessions
with parents, students and high school
counselors.

Porter said prospective students are
encouraged to visit Pitt if they can. “Anytime
you get a student on campus you have a
greater opportunity to enroll him. We're
doing everything we can to get them
here.” I

For students who can't make the trip,
the university can mail a 15-minute video

that offers a perspective of the University
and the City of Pittsburgh. '
The admissions department made an
effort to increase the number of potential
students from within the state and local
area by implementing the University of
Pittsburgh Outreach Programs in 1987.
The programs involve students in sixth
through ninth grades from 40 ‘middle
schools and junior high schools in
Allegheny, Beaver, Washington and
Westmoreland counties. According to
Outreach Coordinator Suzanne Lizik, the
primary purpose is to increase students’
awareness of the prospect of attending

college and what they need to do to
prepare for it. “We want [...l to let them
know they should be thinking about it
now,” she said.

Outreach sends students and parents a
booklet entitled “Countdown to College,”
which details the curricula required to
gain entry into Pitt as well as other school,
and tells students what they should be
doing to prepare.

~ Students who visit the Pitt campus are
given a tour of sites such as Pitt Stadium,
the Cathedral of Learning’s nationality
rooms and one of the professional schools.

become a very small place, and what

happens in South Africa, for example, is
instantaneously available to people in the
[United States], and vice versa.

Considering the high attrition rate of
black students at Pitt, where do you
see the connection between the
attrition rate and the small amount of
black faculty here? _

It’s a tired term, but the “role model” —

there is something to that. If students see
and grow up with people who are doing
these kinds of things, it makes it
immediately apparent that they too can do
these kinds of things.

In addition to that, however, is the fact
that there is a sensitivity, which isn’t to say
that white faculty are not sensitive, but
there is a peculiar sensitivity that black
faculty can bring not only instruction and
that kind of business, but also to their
colleagues with regard to these matters.

 

ALPHA EPSILON DELTA

ROLL!

The absence of a sufficiently large number
of black faculty at Pitt sure has an impact
on the success potential on students here.
In broader terms it has an impact on the
success potential of all students.

Former Provost Rudolf Weingartner
cited the problems over his lack of
participation in budget decisions as
the reason for his resignation. How
much power do you have in deciding
the budget of the university?

I am fully involved. The decisions are
ultimately made by the president. Each of
the senior officers [is] required to submit
to the president a budget for [his or her]
respective [area], and that starts at the

departmental level and makes its way up

to the provost.

It is then my responsibility to put before
the president what I believe to be an '
appropriate statement of the sources to
support the academic and research

Continued from page A-27
programs that report to my office,
and the same thing is done by the
executive vice president and the
senior vice president for the
Health and Sciences for their
respective departments. Then we
haggle about where scarce
resources go.

The decision is ultimately the
president’s because the president
has been given that responsibility
by the Board of Trustees.

I participated in the decision to

‘ implement a hiring freeze. I

participated fully in that decision.
I thought it was prudent and I
agreed with the president. There
was no question [the timing] could
not have been worse, but under
the circumstances I thought we
couldn’t in a responsible way not

take that step. Hindsight is always

a hundred percent. It is too bad
that we didn't do it far earlier than
we did.

Many faculty members have
complained thatteaching isn’t
a priority at Pitt, that the
emphasis is too much on
research and that not enough
money is given to encourage
good teaching here. How
would you respond to that?
The perceptions of the faculty
are based in reality. At an
institution .like Pitt there is the

need for a balance between »

instruction on the one hand and
research efforts on the other. In
many places we need to redress
that balance.
~» We are both a teaching and a
research institution and I know
our pronouncements very often
neglect the teaching side of the
institution. In fact, the.mission of
this institution involves teaching,
research and service, and that is
the kind of. redress thatl think we
need.

It’s a difficult matter to balance.
I think there  is sufficient interest

on the part of both our faculty ’

and the administration to make
this balance more or less

. realizable, and I think we just

have to bend our effort to make
it happen.

WithPresident Posvar’s recent
announcement‘ of his
retirement, what will be your
role in.the selection process
of the new president, and what
would you be looking for in
the person you will have to
work with?

There is no formal role for the
provost in the search. My own
sense is that we — collective we,
students, faculty and so forth;
should have a vision of what this
institution ought to be in the
future and that vision should
emerge from the present planning
efforts in which we are engaged
so that it can be set before the
candidates for the presidency so
that they have a sense of what we
think we are and where we think
we’re going.

It will also provide us with a
yardstick with which we measure
these candidates with regard to
their promise for taking us there.
We as an institution are not a
blank sheet of paper upon which
a new institution will write, and I

think we’ve got to be aggressive
in seeking out a person who will
be able to lead us where our
collective visions suggest we
ought to go.

With regard to recruitingblack
faculty, there seem to be two
main schools of thought at
Pitt. One, which some faculty
have called for, involves
setting aside a certain amount
of money from which to draw
when qualified minority
faculty are found, in order to
guarantee that they will be
hired, regardless of budget
constraints at that particular
time. President Posvar has
disagreed with this and said
that if minority faculty are
found, the money will be
provided for “ off the top.”
Do you believe in the set -
aside theory, or should we wait
until the minority candidate
is found to get the money?

It would be wonderful to have
a potof several million dollars
from which we hire minority
faculty. That is neither realistic,

practical nor, I think, politically,
at the moment, advisable.

We don’t have a pot of money
from which we can draw in
order to make these things
happen, so I would rather deal
in what’s real, and what’s real is
that we do from year to year find
the wherewithal to replace
vacancies and even from time to
time hire new faculty. It’s
eminently more practical from
my point of view to do it within
the sources that we have rather
than count on something that is
more in the domain of wishful
thinking than it is in reality,
which is why I’ve said to deans,
chairmen and others that we as
an institution are committed to
afﬁrmative action, and we will
fulfill those commitments.

Because it is an institutional
priority we take it right off the
top. Now, that’s often difficult to

. (10 because our l'€SOUl'C€S are

limited, which is why it strikes
me that we ought to use -the
resources we have to go in an
aggressive way after minority
faculty, because if we make the

effort, we are assured of the
existence of resources to acquire
them. That may mean that we
acquire fewer minority faculty,
but that’s the name of the game.

Now on the other hand, it’s
worth, I think, saying in a way
that, at least from where I sit, the
set—asides are relegation to
second-class citizenship all over
again. So if there has to be special
monies for the black faculty or
other minority—group members
that we bring here, then they
come here in a special status.
That is not desirable either for
them or for the institution. They
should be full participants in the
educational and research
processes of this institution
without any strings attached to
their involvement at all.

How valid is the accusation
that Pitt’s administration
operates in a top-down
management style regarding
the faculty making decisions
and the shared-governance
idea?

We have not been very open.
I mean, there is a desperate
need for faculty to participate
in the decision- making. They
already participate in the
‘decision-making in their
departments and that kind of
stuff, but it’s the decision—making
at the institutional level from
which they feel estranged.

It’s been the case that the
administration [has] not been as
open with the faculty as I think
we ought to be; we pride
ourselves in going out and hiring
the brightest and the best to
become members of our faculty,
and these are people of enormous
competence and intelligence. By
consulting with faculty about
these decisions, we take
advantage of [an] incredible
resource, because \ no
administration has a corner on all
the knowledge about any set of
decisions. I think not only will it
have a desirable political outcome
but it will also have, and I think
this is far more important than
anything else,
outcome for the university.

“If he gets all B’s, then [his
father will] get him a bike. The
kid works hard, brings his report

The goal post keeps being

Johnson said that one’s
personality also plays a role in
addiction.

“Another thing that can
produce compulsive/obsessive
behavior is a parent who is not
available or is absent or just
doesn’t pay much attention to
the child. At this point, sometime
around 13 or 14, the adolescent
may say to himself, ‘No matter

Did you know there’s a super Thrift

workaholic, who has to always
prove to himself that he is
worthwhile. Sometimes, they
become addicts to escape the
pain of not receiving love when
they were lchildrenl,” he said.

“The scenario also could be
that the addict has a passive/
regressive personality that stems
from the same problem, except
that instead of trying harder, he
gives up completely and [asks],
‘What’s the use?’ Usually this
person becomes a procrastinator
and doesn’t set any goals. Inside,
however, he still needs
gratification and may turn to dru gs
in order to obtain it,” Johnson
said.

Even though addiction is found
in every walk of life, the
concentration of drug abuse falls
in the lower economic groups,
according tojohnson. This points
to the role of social acceptability
which every human being wants
and needs in his or her
development.

l_ SATISFACTION GUARANTEED f H

  

Newsweek article, has led experts
to focus on the pleasure centers
of the brain. A neurotransmitter
called dopamine is released to fill

'the gap between two nerves,
called a synapse, in order to relay
a message of pleasure whenever
such a stimulus occurs. Drugs,
such as cocaine, block the
dopamine from crossing to the
other nerve, repeatedly
stimulating the receiving nerve.
In this way tolerance to a
substance occurs when the nerve
begins to be desensitized to
dopamine.

Other chemicals in the body
affect the way nerve cells receive
messages. The idea that
alcoholism stems from a genetic
trait may not be entirely true. A
tolerance to the effects of alcohol
may be what actually is
inherited, making it necessary
for the victim to drink more‘
than others to feel the effects.

The only way to cure or help
an addict, saidjohnson, is to give
him goals and interests, some
form of hope that outweighs the
pleasure of drugs. This can only
be accomplished through a
combination of treatment,
counseling and support in order
to get the addict back into society.

Help can be found on campus
through a number of programs
such as Drug and Alcohol
Responsible Education and
Personal Education Assessment
and Referral, according to Shirley
Haberman, a health educator at
Student Health Services. DARE, a

student—run program, tries to
educate students on how to drink
responsibly, Haberman said.

“DARE tries to prevent
substance abuse and" provide an
educational service for students."

Through the Health and
Education Office one could get
in touch with PEAR. According to
Haberman, many people go to
PEAR after violating university
drug and alcohol policies, but
anyone can go there for help.

PEAR assesses a potential
addict’s problems and then refers
him or her to appropriate social
workers, counselors and support
groups.

Campus support groups,
ranging from Alcoholic’s
Anonymous and Adult Children
of Alcoholics to a. group for eating
disorders, have an open—door
policy and are free to all students.

Evaluation Unit (PTEU).

PTEU is one of 32 medical
centers which participate in national
trials sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health.

"We’re the ones trying to develop
newtreatments. Some of them [are]
bizarre, some more specific," said
Dave McAdoo, PTEU’s project
director.

McAdoo said one experimental

through prevention.

"Progress is being made," said
McAdoo, “but not fast enough forthe
people who are sick.

‘‘I don't see us coming up with a
cure even by 2000,” he added.
“People need to focus more on
keeping themselves healthy."

At PACT, the Presbyterian-
University Hospital affiliated
outpatient center for AIDS patients,
more than 150 patients are currently
undergoing treatment.

"We really stress’ a
multidisciplinary approach that
encompasses the social as well as

treatment that shows promise
involves a method also being tested
in cancer patients. In these clinical
trials, scientists remove virus-killing
white blood cells, called ‘killer T-
cells or CD8 cells, from patients who
are HIV infected. The cells are then
boosted with interleukin-2 (IL-2), a
biological response modifier.

The treatment has been
completed on one patient, who

“tolerated it very well”. Five other-

patients are expected to be given
the IL-2 treatment in the next few
months, said McAdoo.

'‘If we can use a person’s natural
defense mechanism to efficiently
fight or control HIV infection,” said
Dr. Monto Ho, principal investigator
of Pitt's AIDS Clinical Trials Group,
"we maybe on the road to slowing
down or even stopping replication of
the virus inside the body.”

“The success of the initial
volunteer gives us enouragement,”
added John Armstrong, Sc.D., who
presented the findings.

Since PTEU wasfounded in 1986,
more than 400 HIV positive
individuals have been screened to
participate in its experimental
trials of drugs. Over 200 have
become involved in the trials.

WhilelL-2 and otherexperimental
drugs such as AZT (zidovudine) and
ddl (dldeoxyinosine) have shown
an ability to slow the onset of AIDS
in HIV infected people, McAdoo and
Klemanskiemphasizedthattheonly

medical problems that people with
HIV infection are faced with,”
Klemanski said.

In addition to Allegheny County
residents, PACTtreats patients from
13 other Pennsylvania counties, as
well as some from Ohio and West
Virginia.

“Many of the people from outside
Allegheny County who come here
are afraid to go to local physicians
for fear that people will find out they
are HIV positive,” said Klemanski,
who holds masters degrees in social
work and health administration.

"They are afraid of being
discriminated againstand Iosingtheir
jobs and fearfortheir personal safety.
There needs to be much more
compassion toward these people,”
she added.

Along with national trends, PACT

has seen a decrease in homosexual 

patients treated at the facility.

"The numbers of gays are
definitely down, and the numbers of
women, drug users and
heterosexuals who are infected are
increasing,” said Klemanski. I

“A big problem is ignorance.
People believe‘ AIDS can be spread
through casual contact, but at the
sametime they are not careful about
the people they goto bed with. That’s
wheretherealdangeris,"she added.

"Scientists are leaving no stone
unturned as a possibility for AIDS
treatment, but education is just as
important. We need to reach those
who are at risk.”

Starting this fall, students

The Student Government
Board has recently appro-
priated $42,197 for “Tele-
fact,” an informational
phone line geared primarily
toward answering questions
about the university and the
city of Pittsburgh.

The information that is to
be provided by Telefact is
currently obtainable through
other sources, including the
Towers’ desk, the William
Pitt Union information desk,
campus police and the

university operators.

P While Telefact will provide
a broader range of in-

Cross-dressing, tattoos and nudity are infor the '90s

“Educational experts should realize that
the goody—goody teens who reach their
peak in high school these days only have
weight problems, divorce and alcoholism
in their future. It's the had kids who
healthily reject authority and suffer teen
angst who build characterand excel later
in life."
—‘— John Waters, in a special teen—age
Newsweek edition.

For the '90s, teen-agers have a special
responsibility. Once again, high-school
and college students must live up to their

_ divine duty and drive everyone over the

age of thiitysomething and fortysomething
absolutely crazy. Speaking from my own
sad experience, those of us who are
“twentysomething” failed miserably. We
graduated from high school between 1982
and 1986, the heart of the Reagan years.

We're between the ages of 21 and 25 and
are the biggest losers. Asjohn Waters points
out, young people must bring the terror
back into the teen-age years if they want
respect and psychological health.

My generation, the '80s kids, like wimpy
music and even borrow the music of the

Mark Smith

once, wild and radical '60s to ease our
sorrow. My generation fell in love with
Morton Downey Jr., Ronald Reagan and
Oliver North. These people could be the
heroes of everyone over the age of 65! The
baby boomers, the '60s youth gone wild,
earned respect and fought back. Everyone
between the ages of 17 and 19 has the same
chance to gain respect and make fools of
the '80s teens. I sense a change with the

incoming freshmen, and I have some
suggestions that might help based on my
years of research discovering ways to irritate
my entire family.

Suggestion #1: Don't be a part of the
herd. For the '90s, conformity will be out
Over the past year it has already begun to
lose ground. College students no longer
look like the L.L. Bean catalog. Get tattoos,
cross-dress, don't shave your body hair
and you'll have a good time. Fraternities
and sororities, once popular in the mid-
'80s, will dwindle in numbers. Large groups
or cliques like these will die out in a couple
of years. However, they will still have one
redeeming social value as a place for a lot
of lesbian, straight and gay sex. If you join,
please do it safely.

Suggestion #2: Rethink sex roles. In my
generation, hyper-masculine straight men
didn't improve their relationship with

women. Rambo became the male standard.
Straight men who still harass women will _

have it rough with this new generation of 3' 3

women. I see women fighting back.

Straight and bisexual women will not
tolerate hyper-masculine behavior. With

comments like “Suck my —, baby,” “Hey
little girl. ...,” and “Nice —,” a hyper-
masculine male should try dating men

because no woman (and I should even
say no man) would want to be in the same
room with such a jackass.

Suggestion #3: Empowerment through 

nudity. “Obscenity” has always driven
parents wild, but “dirty” rock music and
Andrew Dice Clay, the bigot, won't cut
the mustard for rebellion. For a teen who
wants to gain some respect, I suggest
wearing as little clothing as possible. Don't
worry about your physique; the Anglo-

and street directions;

oTo sports fans concerning
injury reports, point spreads,
game times, schedules and scores;

0 To alumni about game times
and event—location changes;

0 To faculty and staff about

university policies, procedures

and function locations.

In extending this service to
people outside the university, the
SGB is forcing students to foot the
bill for services that anyone can
access. ‘

Though Telefact’s first year will
be paid for with the funds from
the SGB reserve fund, the board
stated in its proposal that “ideally”
the burden of future operating
costs will be shared by the SGB,
the Office of Student Activities,
the Office of New Student
Programs, Pitt Program Council,
the Office of Student Affairs and

or university administration. With

$10,025 in start-up costs, the yearly
expense for maintaining Telefact
will be $32,172. ‘

In what many administrators
have called “one of the tightest
budget years since the 1960s," it is
doubtful that any of the above

3 administrative offices would allot

funds for Telefact next year. The
Pitt Program Council and the SGB
are directly funded ‘through the
$32 activity fee that each student
must pay. Therefore, it is likely
that funds for this program will,
one way or the other, come out of
the students’ pockets.

SGB member Pat Abramowich
has also said that there is a

possibility that no office will take
responsibility for the program and
that next year's SGB could vote to
discontinue Telefact. In this
scenario, the $10,025 spent on
start-up costs would be wasted,
and the $32,172 in operating costs
would have been spent on a failed
project.

Not only did the SGB use poor
planning in assuming that others
will share the burden of Telefact,
but they were also irresponsible
in determining the Telefact
budget.

The Student Government Board
proposed that student workers
who will man the Telefact
lines be paid $6 an hour,
and the student co-
ordinator $7 an hour.
Student Activities Dir- I
ector Joe Cavalla was made
aware of these salaries and
had no problem with the
dollar amounts.

The students who are
employed at the union as
information-desk atten-
dants are paid $3.80 an hour.
Other union em-ployees start
at anywhere from $3.80 to $4.50
for the house managers. These
students, who have not received
an across-the-board increase for
over a year, have sent several
proposals for pay increases to
Cavalla, who refused their
requests.

Abramowich justified the salary
expenditure by saying that
Telefact needs to attract the most
qualified students and therefore
has to offer higher salaries than

the library, the student union and
other» student employers.

In fact, the jobs of the
information-desk attendant and
the Telefact operator are very
similar. Both are charged with
providing a source of information
for students.

There was no need for student
salaries to be set so high.
Unfortunately, when the SGB is
no longer paying for Telefact, the
office that is will be forced to
maintain those high salaries. It is
unlikely that the students who
have already worked for a year at

  
   
 
 
 
  
 

the $6 salary will be bumped
down to the normal salary range
for Pitt student workers. In the
future, if the information program
continues, the high Telefact
salaries might be the reason that
the union employees will be
passed over again for raises, to

compensate for the Telefact.

expenditure.

Telefact is based upon an
existing service at Bowling Green
University, where their factline

has been in existence since 1971.
Pat Abramowich said that the
other consideration in setting the
T elefact salaries so high was that
the employees at BGU’s factline
were paid salaries that were
above the normal student salary.
In fact, the employees at their
factline are paid $4.55 an hour
and the student coordinator is
paid $4.75, with the average
student salary there at about
$3.85. Those salaries are only 70
cents over the average. The
proposed Telefact salaries would
put those students at $2.20 above
that of the information desk
attendants. Furthermore, the
factline at BGU is paid for from
the public relations
budget——— not the
students’ activity fund.
y The Student
’ Government Board re-
serve fund is comprised
« of the leftover money from
~ the StudentActivities fee that
isn't allocated to any student

‘ _ _/ group. Although last year a
tug?’ ceiling figure of $50,000 was

set, until recently it contained
almost $87,000. Obviously, the
money had/ to be spent, but
Telefact is not what Pitt needed.
Here are two alternatives that
would have make better use of
the reserve fund money:

0 In addition to a campus bus,
Carnegie Mellon provides an
escort service from 6:30 p.m. to
7:30 a.m. According to Jim
I.aPaglia, director of campus
security at CMU, students can call
the service and a shuttle will pick

\, .

them up anywhere on campus
and drive them within one and a
half miles to their front doorstep.

LaPaglia said the service costs
$60,000, that makes the service
econcornically feasible for Pitt's
reserve fund. Considering the
South Oakland rapes, an escort
service seems a hell of a lot more
appropriate than a Pittsburgh

sports information line. For that, A

information, students and
Pittsburgh residents can read any
one of Pittsburgh's three daily
newspapers.

0 Another possibility is 2; dir-

ectory where students rate
professors on campus.
Considering the Office of

Measurement and Evaluation has
students survey their professors

in classes, this would be an easy“

way to gather student reactions to
professors. A group of students
could be commissioned by the
SGB to make written assessments
on professors based on the OME’s
surveys. The results could be
bound and distributed to students.

These suggestions would take
great strides in solving two

important concerns of students at :

Pitt; campus safety and which
professors are worth taking. The
fact that this $42,000 is from the
student reserve fund would make
it logical that it be spent to help
the Pitt student as best it could.
The truth is that Telefact is nothing
more than a talking encyclopedia
with the added twist of promoting

Pitt and the Oakland Community‘

And why should students pay
for that?

Panthers

should Wait
for a tastier
conference

For over a century, the Pitt
football program has survived as
a football independent -— a team
without a league. The Panther
has been free to roam as it pleased.
. Although thatPantherhadbeen
content for a long time, a Nittany
Lion, whom the Panther had
fought for territorial rights over
the years, was lured away recently
to Big Ten country when that

conference threw a steak at its ‘

feet.

Seeing this, the'Panther grew
hungry and the current zoo
keeper, Ed Bozik (take that as
you will), has taken down the
“Don’t feed the Panther” sign
around the Panther’s territory.

Right outside, a shadowy figure
(the Metro Conference) is waving
a steak in front of the Panther’s
eyes.

The Panther is hungry and
thinks of grabbing for the Metro’s
steak, but as soon as it positions
itself to pounce, several more
slabs of meat are dangled in front

of its eyes —— the Atlantic Coast
Conference, a new Eastern
Seaboard conference and, far in
the distance, that same Big Ten.
They now all seek the Panther’s
attention.

Every so often, talk of Pitt
entering a football conference
comes up, then dies out faster
than a panther really can devour
a steak.'This time, however, the
conversations have reached more
concrete levels, and the university
may soon make a critical decision
regarding the future of Pitt
football.

‘ Penn State joining the Big Ten, .
Arkansas joining the Southeastern
Conference, Florida State about
to do the same— the big time
college programs are playing an
expensive version of musical
chairs right now, and Pitt doesn’t
want to be the one caught without
a seat.

Foremost on Pitt's agenda is an
invitation from the eight-team
Metro Conference, which has
given Pitt an Oct. 15 deadline to
decide on joining.

The proposal on the table calls
for Pitt, as well as Syracuse, Boston
College and East Carolina, to join
the conference for football only

We, the “baby-buster"
generation, have been
characterized in the media by the
baby boomers as a group known
for its selﬁshness, high suicide
rate, drug and alcohol abuse,
satanism and violent music that
“glorifies” all of the above.

Most recently, an overly
publicized Gallup Poll noted that
our generation reads, thinks and
cares less than any other
generation before it. Later, a less
ballyhooed report hit the presses,
saying that nobody reads ‘much,
knows much or cares much,
except older black males.

Surprisingly, “Entertainment
T onight” failed to use that poll as
a lead story —— or maybe that is
not so surprising. After all,
Americans like to make a fuss
over things, though we never
really want to take responsibility
for anything. In the past 10 years,

into the California sunset. Yet we
still approved, and in 1988 we
voters decided not to worry, to
read George's lips and to be
happy about “feel-good” politics.

While Reagan decided to cut
taxes for the rich in the hope that
their wealth would spread to the
poor, his “trickle-down” theory

didn’t work econornically— only
morally. When the going got
tough, the tough looked for a
scapegoat. So when our kids
shot themselves out of despair or
shot other kids out of greed, we
blamed Judas Priest and Nike for
saying to “Just do it.”

When our kids refused to read,
to learn or to care, we blamed
the schools for not educating
them. When our kids became
sexually active or pregnant, we
blamed the schools for giving
them “too much” information.

We told the kids to “just say
no,” while many of us didn’t. So
we declared a war on drugs and
fought it with nicotine-addicted
“Czar” William Bennet and
overcrowded jails. We also
employed rhetoric that told
middle-class America that we
were winning with each drug
bust in an inner-city ghetto. We

believed it even while our cities,
suburbs and farmlands went up
in crack and cocaine smoke.

We couldn't control ourselves,
so in desperation we looked to
the government, the courts and
the schools, and screamed “DO
SOMETHING!!!” So they did.
They proposed endless
legislation, took away arts
funding, labelled albums and
enforced a 24-hour ban by the
Federal Communications
Commission on all “indecent”
programming.

But we didn’t like that, so we
screamed about censorship. We
sued rock bands for subliminal
messages and arrested record-
store owners because we did not
like the albums they sold.

One man even sued
McDonald’s for $74, because his
son had a craving for the Dick
Tracy game cards. He was too
stupid or too lazy to tell his kid to
get a paper route and support his
own addiction.

Now, Jay Leno is selling Doritos
by putting down the mental
capabilities of “the younger
generation,” saying something
to the effect of, “We’re nottalking
brain cells here, just taste.’_’ Young
adults are always America’s last
resort for scapegoats.

What Leno and the rest of the
grownups are ignoring is that
theirs is the generation that made
popular drug use, disco dancing,
rampant consumerism and all of
the other activities that contribute
to the destruction of brain cells.

Herein I believe is the
motivating force behind all of
this “youth bashing.”

They feel guilty. They were
the generation with a conscience
— gatekeepers to the age of
Aquarius, or so they thought.

Then around the mid-’70s, most
of them traded in their tie-dyes
for polyester suits, and the “me”
generation was born.

Now, all they have left is
Woodstock memories. But they

Women — hoping to use your minds at Pitt? Think again

 

Mindy
Boffemmyer

If we are to believe our high-
school history lessons, women
throughout time were content
with their servile lot in life before
unruly bitches like Susan ‘B.
Anthony came along and riled us
up.

Suffrage was a reluctant gift
from men rather than a struggle
of nearly a century on the part of
women.

Women were pacified then (if
our history books are accurate)
until hopping aboard the civil-
rights bandwagon, which sought
to liberate everyone — including
the straight, white man.

In the history books, women-

are yet another group of
subservients —— as are blacks and
American Indians — too stupid
and docile to function
autonomously, utterly dependent
upon the generosity of the “great”
white male.

In actuality, women have
rebelled against male domination
for centuries. But, like other
groups with minority status, we
are denied and deluded about
our history at all stages of
education.

We are conditioned to believe
that women have historically
been passive non-achievers.
Following this training, women

——

"perfect" slim and muscular figure
will be out in a few years. All
women should go topless
(women, please keep in mind that
I'm gay). If men can go shirtless,
so should women. Women might
not even be arrested because a
woman could file sex
discrimination charges. This
should stir your parents and make
a great story for Tbe Pitt News. If
women can't go topless, men
should wear bras and bikinis.
Working together, women and
men will make teen rebellion a
national phenomenon, as it
should be. Men in bras will make
a good news story as well.
Suggestion #4: Reject authority.
It's the best and most sure-ﬁre
way of rebelling with class

because it has never gone out of

style. My generation said, “Just

’ Say No!” Nancy Reagan pushed

this crap without a fight from the
wimpy '80s kids. Don’t let a first
lady or president spoil your fun.
The new teens should just say
“yes” to everything. Say yes to
nudity, the Earth and tolerance.
The '80s would have been a great
decade if Nancy went on TV with
the message “Just say ‘yes’ to
nudity, the environment,

tolerance and safe & free love;
just say ‘no’ to substance abuse,
prejudice and apathy.”

Mark Smith is a columnist for

tend to adopt passive, servile
roles in their work and ‘personal
relationships. This can hardly be
considered a coincidence.

In a sexist society, how can
those institutions which represent
the makeup. of the society (i.e.
coed schools) be anything but
sexist? -

Educators marvel at the way
the boys “catch up" with the girls
in junior-high school — a

phenomenon which becomes less
baffling when one considers that
this is the point at which a girl's
“stupidity training” begins.

At the onset of adolescence, a
girl is instructed to conceal her
intelligence and concentrate on
her appearance — to sit pretty
and play dumb — so as not to
repel her peers, both male and
female.

One might suggest that “things
are different in college,” that
sexism is less predominant.
Perhaps, but any amount of
sexism to any degree is
intolerable.

Sexism is like a disease in that
when the symptoms are obvious,
one is inclined to fight it, and a
recovery is possible. But when
the symptoms are less apparent,
the disease is all too frequently

ignored and allowed to progress
beyond the “treatable” stages.
The symptoms of sexism —- of
both varieties —— abound at Pitt
In one of my classes, a professor
relentlessly leered at and ﬂirted
with a female student, even
following her to the elevator tot
smother her in artiﬁcial praise
and offer “tutoring.”
“He gives me the creeps,” she
complained —— but did nothing.
The primary argument used by
women to promote all-female
learning institutions is that men
tend to dominate coed classes.
Look around you. The women in
your classes will tend to be quiet,
diligent note-takers, while the
men will be inclined to question

the things they are being taught. .

Consider the social side of
college life. As you’re dressing to

go out, ask yourself why you've
chosen one outﬁt over another.

Contemplate the atmosphere
of the bars you will probably
grow to frequent. Are the ogles
and catcalls of a group of male
students lined up‘ at a bar

somehow less offensive and «

disgusting than those of a row of
old men on the street? In both
cases a woman is reduced to an
object, either desirable or
repelling to men.

When Michal criticized David

in the Old Testament, she was.

struggling to raise her standing
from “object” to “human being.”
Don’t remember that one? It isn’t
surprising.

This idea holds true in some respects;
however, more and more students are
becoming part of a new hate movement

The big four of hate —— racism, homophobia,
sexism and anti-Semitism —— are appearing

in our colleges in very real and frightening
numbers, and college administrators are
wondering just what to do about it.

Are we teaching diversity too late?

First, the oldest and biggest ones are
taken from the smaller ones and packed
into the back of a ﬁlthy truck. Blindly, they
shift back and forth, unaware of - the
impending doom man's voracious appetite
has in store for them. As the farmer's lights
disappear into the night, those left behind
shiver in their cold loneliness. I

When the truck ﬁnally reaches the
packing factory, the cargo is scrubbed
and washed. For some, the death is quick
and painful —— heaved into a vat of soapy
water and shipped. For others the process
is more grim. The factory worker produces
his implement of death. The thick notches
on its blade tell the tale of a thousand of
these tragedies. He yanks one from the
masses and pulls the blade back, tearing a
long ﬂeck of skin. The carrot screams, but
goes unheard. The clatter of the cruel
machinery drowns out the feeble cries.

The carnage continues. Down the grim
corridor called “the line,” a myriad of
atrocities are committed on their crunchy

I wonder if I will soften, as my

now seem to keep me in such

don't realize what they have
entered into. They only know
what they have escaped from.
They have escaped from the laws
of their parents, the confines of
their comfortable high school and
the laid—back security of a family
life.

But what they've entered into
they have only begun to
experience. What college has to
offer is very enticing. Many come
here with the idea that this is the

Pitt's name has also been
brought up in recent discussions
regarding the ACC and the Big
Ten, as well as the proposed
Eastern Seaboard conference.

The benefits of joining a
conference are many, including

television contracts and a
guaranteed chance at a bowl
game, both of which lead to
increased exposure for the
university— which leads to more
money for the zoo keepers and
the university.

But Pitt can do a lot better than
the Metro.

In the first place, Pitt Coach
Paul Hackett has stated that he
will stress academics as well as
athletics to his players. Hackett
kept that promise last spring by
barring several academically
struggling players from spring

practice. This summer, Hackett.

sent coaches and other Pitt
football administrators to selected
classes every day to make sure
his players were attending.

If Pitt hopes to continue these
academic efforts, the Metro is
deﬁnitely not the league to join.

Pitt belongs to the Association
of American Universities, a
collection of 59 of the top
academic universities in the
nation. Harvard, MIT and Stanford
are included in the group. By no
coincidence, there are no AAU
schools in the Metro.

At least five of the league’s
members have been penalized or
sanctioned by the NCAA in the
past decade, and the league is
not generally known for its
scholarly athletes.

By joining a conference like
the Metro, Pitt might appear to
compromise some of that
academic prowess it has strived
for in order to make a few extra
bucks and stay competitive
athletically.

The Metro seems to be on the
same course as the Southwest

But there has never been a more
appropriate time to say that there
must be a redefined line of
demarcation between church and

Senator Jesse Helms’ “morality
in the arts” issue confronted the
National Endowment for the Arts’

attack on NEA appropriations.
He wanted everyone who
received money to produce nice
and inoffensive art. Inoffensive
to whom, Helms? If the Star of
David, an ankh or a pentagram
had been submerged in urine,
would Helms have been so quick
to jump to the morality front?

AIDS (adz) n. — the nastiest four-letter
word around.

The statistics are shocking. A June
report by the Centers for Disease Control
shows that since 1981, 136,204 Americans
have been diagnosed with AIDS. The
prognosis — fatal. So far, 83,145 have
died.

For us college students who are
exclusively heterosexual and not IV-
drug users, it may be easy to brush aside
AIDS concerns and just ignore the
problem. And 10, even five years ago
maybe we safely could have. But we
can't afford to anymore. AIDS is no
longer a disease that exclusively affects
homosexuals, hemophiliacs and drug
abusers. It is a disease of our entire
generation — a killer of women, children
and adolescents, as well as those

considered “high risk.”

At the International Conference on
AIDS this June, researchers reported that
the spread‘ of AIDS is slowing among
some gay men, “but soaring among teen-
agers, women, crack smokers and heavy
drinkers.” Considering college life, it is
safe to assume that most students fall into

' at least one of these categories sometime

in their college career. In fact, a 1988
report published by the CDC states that
21 percent of AIDS cases are among
people 20 to 29 years old. Given the fact
that the HIV infection is harbored in the
boiy an average of eight years before
transforming into AIDS, one can see that

many of these victims contracted the
infection as teen-agers.

The group most hardly stricken is
minorities. In New York City, 1 percent of
black and Hispanic teen—age mothers are
HIV positive. Women now constitute 10
percent of all AIDS cases, up from 6
in 1982. And heterosexual
transmission of the disease has become
increasingly evident to health officials.

It light of all of this, it is hardly surprising

Jenifer Crook

that research dollars to find an AIDS cure
have increased dramatically in the past few
years. Last month, the Bush administration
announced a planned $109 million increase
in spending on AIDS programs for the 1991
fiscal year.

This raises the total annual package to
$1.7 billion — making AIDS receive more
research dollars than any disease except
cancer. Pretty impressive — but is this mass
spending ‘justified? Definitely.

Many people may argue that the numbers
of AIDS deaths are not nearly as many as
the number of lives claimed by heart disease
and cancer each year, so why should it be
granted more funding? The justification lies
in the form of HIV infection.

The Centers for Disease Control estimate
that between 1 and 1.5 million Americans
are infected with the AIDS virus. The majority

...But at expense of other diseases?

AIDS is real. AIDS is a terrible, terrible
disease. No one should, or can, ignore it
No one is. -

But is AIDS the next bubonic plague?
Will AIDS explode into the mainstream
of America and wipe out half the
population?

Aggressive political lobby groups such
as AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power
would have you believe so. The real
answer is no.

Jim Tezak

The first report of the National
Commission on AIDS was released earlier
this year. Amid all the hoopla over the
release of the seven-page letter, most
people failed to notice that some of its
conclusions were factually dubious, at
best. —

The report stated that “the [AIDS]
epidemic is reaching crisis proportions
among women.” In fact, women make up
only 9.5 percent of those diagnosed with
AIDS, and in 1989, the number of women
who contracted the disease dropped
drastically. A recent survey of 16,000
college students found 28 men infected
with the HIV virus and only two women.

ACT -UP and other groups have cried
for sympathy, compassion and more
money. They deserve these. The
government, and even the Catholic
Church, has granted them this. These

groups scream for compassion, but they .5‘.

show none themselves.

Case in point: A few months ago when
President Bush turned his kinder, gentler
attention to AIDS, he gota slap in the face
for his trouble. During a speech where
Bush endorsed a measure to ban
discrimination against persons with AIDS
and announced an 18-percent increase in
AIDS spending, protesters rudely

interrupted his speech four times. They ‘ti’;

were apparently upset that Bush didn’t
speciﬁcally endorse‘ homosexuality in his
speech; he didn’t denounce it either.
The federal government will spend
$1.7 billion on AIDS in 1990, more than
on any other disease. Where did l3ush get
the money for this increase in these
budget-crunching times? I don't know.
But I do know that he cut funding for

other diseases, most notably cancer and‘57i‘

heart disease. This is despite the fact that
in 1989 these two illnesses killed nearly
70 times as many Americans as‘ AIDS did.

Federal funding for a research program
at the University of Illinois which had
provided treatment for sickle-cell anemia
patients in the Chicago area for 15 years
was cut from 2 million dollars per year to
zero. The head of the program said that

would not have happened if AIDS didn’t'5¥i*:

get so much money.

According to the Center for Disease
Control, 21,488 people died from AIDS in
1989. Since 1981 AIDS has caused 85,430

deaths. Compare that to more than a

million Americans who will be diagnosed
with cancer this year, nearlyhalf of whom
will die. In 1990, heart disease will claim
the lives of nearly one million people
nationally. Each year 40,000 women die of
breast cancer. A few million dollars extra
could buy a hell of a lot of mammograms.

According to CDC, as far as AIDS
spreading into the American heterosexual
community, here is what the facts say
about all those persons now classiﬁed as
having AIDS and how they contracted the
disease: 82,304 through homosexual or
bisexual practices; 9,370 are homosexual
or bisexual and using intravenous drugs;

29,487 are IV-drug users; 6,952 are classiﬁed
as heterosexual.

The fact is that the AIDS virus, wherever
it came from, has become lodged in the
gay-men and lesbian community.

Despite this, the fact is that AIDS is a
terrible and deadly disease, and it needs to
be controlled. No one should have to
suffer the ravages of AIDS. Just because
most persons with AIDS are gay does not
mean that people should be ostracized
because of their sexual preference, and
neither should anyone with AIDS.

‘One of the main arguments for more
AIDS funding, though, is that AIDS is a

contagious disease; many others are not.

There, however, is the solution to AIDS.

CRUISING

Because it is contagious, it can be controlled
fairly easily. If tomorrow, junkies stopped
sharing needles and both gays and
heterosexuals started using condoms when
engaging in intercourse, AIDS would have
a better chance of ending someday.

Many gay men and lesbians, however,
adamantly refuse to discontinue hazardous
sexual practices. A report presented at the
July AIDS conference stated that so—called
“unsafe sex practices,” including
unprotected anal intercourse, are
increasing again among gay men.

Well, it’s time that groups such as ACT-
UP stopped crying for more sympathy and
more money. To be fair, ACT -UP has
accomplished many, things for persons

with AIDS. When South Carolina tried to .
quarantine AIDS patients in that state, 100 I

members of ACT -UP traveled from New

York to South Carolina to protest.

I think, however, that ACT -UP and 

similar groups spend a disproportionate
amount of time trying to gain more support
for those with AIDS when they could be
devoting more of their energy to trying to
reduce the number of new AIDS cases
each year. AIDS research deserves funding,
but it shouldn’t come at the expense of
diseases that are just as deadly and kill
many times more people than AIDS.

Editor's note: The Pitt News is
introducing a special feature
entitled Campus Forum, which
will consist ofguest columns from
campus leaders.

As [Chairperson] of the Black
Action Society, students often
approach me questioning
whether or not there still exists a
need for such an organization.
My answer to them is always a
resounding “Yes.” Despite “what
studies have shown,” or what
appears on the surface at the
University of Pittsburgh, there
remain strong undercurrents of
racism which still impede the
progress ‘of African—American
students, much like in the past.
This is what I’ve decided to target
with my guest column: “Examples
of why there still exists a need for
the Black Action Society.”

Example 1 appears rather
minute when we examine its
immediate effect on the African-
American family, for in fact it
might not have affected it at all.
However, it is an excellent
example to show the nature of
and level at which racism exists
oncampus.

Iwas ata party in the fall of my
sophomore year with a few white

friends of mine (?) when a fourth
person joined us in talking around
the keg. Somehow the
conversation turned to a black
athlete who was arrested at one
of Pitt’s other campuses.
(Coincidentally, this campus was
in the fourth gentleman's
hometown.) After the gentleman
had filled us in on the “reported”
details, he gave us a little bit of

  Doug

Ligons

“secret” information that I’m quite
sure was not to be told again.

After looking over both his
shoulders to make sure the
“wrong” people weren’t listening,

he looked at us and said, “If
you’re a nigger, you don’t hang
around where I'm from.” Well,

being that I’m a very light—skinned
African-American, he didn’t
realize the magnitude of the
mistake he had just made and
regrettably, I didn’t make him
pay for it on the spot. However,

my point is still made. There

exists at Pitt a strong racist
undertone that society has forced

into hiding rather than eliminated.
And from there it seeks to work

against the African—American
community.
The second example

illustrating why we need BAS
can be taken from my freshman
year at Pitt. During a period of
confusion I thought that an
African-American could actually
be a true, participating “brother”
in one of the university’s white
fraternities. I sure was wrong. I
attended a series of rush events
for one fraternity in particular,
and as I recall I was somewhat
excited about hearing I was going
to receive a bid for membership.
This excitement brought me to
that fraternity’s house on the hill
for the last rush event. (This is
the night I’m assuming bids are
extended.) The night dragged
on until it was my turn to speak
with the fraternity’s president.
Here it is, I thought, and boy,
was I right. T oo right. It seemed
that they decided to offer me a
bid, despitethe fact that my father
is black. The president said, “We
had a long debate, and we’ve
decided we want you to join." A
debate! It wasn’t over then,
though. He said that I had to
understand the nature of the

brothers and that I was going to
hear things and see things, like
the confederate flag on the wall,
that I wouldn’t like and would
have to ignore them. The brothers
weren’t going to change just for
me. A polite way of sayingl could
join if I was willing to deny myself.
I told them thanks, but no thanks,
I have more pride than that.
The point made by this example
is not only that racism still exists

on campus, but that Pitt needs an
organization that provides some
sort of social atmosphere for
African-Americans, as we can not
fully participate at large. (For those
who don’t know, BAS does have
a social agenda.)

The third example illustrates
the fact that university employees,
regardless of tenure, are not totally
devoid of racism, the implication

Give youth a cbance
to rebel their own way

Your tuition has just gone up an “average” of 5.6 percent (for in-
state undergrads) or a whopping 10 percent (for almost everyone
else, grads included) — did you know? Do you care? ,

Some top-notch professors are retiring or leaving the university
(partially for financial reasons) -— did you know? Do you care?

i On—campus housing rates have gone up while a check has still not
been put on the off-campus “slum lords.” Did you know? Do you care?

The federal deﬁcit is astronomical. People are homeless. We still
have no cure for AIDS. Your personal, constitutional rights are
challenged by someone every day. Minorities still face discrimination.
And “the world is going to end in three days. ” Did you know? Do you
care? _

“What's the big deal?”

“Well, I’ll tell you what the big deal is-...”

“I’ve got enough problems of my own without having to worry
about your problems...”

“How can you expect me to be concerned with all of this stuff when
I can’t even get the classes that I want?”

How did all of this happen? I mean, all of these “problems” and
“concerns” that have totally overwhelmed us to the point of which we
don’t even care anymore? There’s just too much to think about—— too
much. The “future of America,” those “young adults” between the
ages of 18 and 29 have too damn much to think about all at one time.
We give up —— give the world back to the “revolutionaries,” the
“crunchy-granola” people, the ones who “made a difference.”

“Our opinions don’t make a difference anymore. No one understands
us, and no one is trying to. Too many times we don’t even understand
ourselves.” Pretty gloomy picture, huh? Do you agree with it? Do
you relate to it? Do you care? Is it true that “all we do is whine about
everything, but do nothing about it?”

Julie Shepard

A Timemagazine article titled “twentysomething: Proceeding With
Caution” (Iuly 16, 1990) says that the 18- to 29—year-old generation is
“hardly recognized as a social force or even noticed much at all.” That
we have “trouble making decisions, we have few heroes, no anthems,
no style to call our own.”

We also “crave entertainment, have short attention spans, hate
yuppies, hippies and druggies, and postpone marriage because we
dread divorce.” Worst of all, we have a “monumental preoccupation
with all the problems the preceding generation will leave for us to
fix.” Goodness, gracious! More gloom, doom and despair.

So, that eternal question, “what do we do about it?”

Maybe we should start at the beginning (novel idea, huh?) —-—— just
exactly who is this “twentysomething” group? Some of us are children
of divorced parents. Some of us belong to strong “traditional”
families. All of us have grown up in the time of Jimmy Carter, Ronald
Reagan, oi_l embargoes, perestroika, AIDS, microwaves, answering

machines, Atari, apartheid and computers. We just can’t imagine life _

without this stuff now or the impact that certain people have had
upon our lives.

True, these inventions and people have had an impact upon the
lives of everyone — how do we justify being so affected by all that’s
happened, especially in the last 10 to 15 years? Well, to many of us,
Vietnam is old news, and the Cold War something that may as well
have happened in Antarctica around the time of the dinosaurs. We
didn’t “live” through these events —— we’ve just heard about them.
They’re distant and have little bearing (as far as we can tell) on our
lives.

The history (that we’ve been taught) that has supposedly “shaped”
and “formed” today's world does not rest very deeply with us —— we
haven’t directly experienced this history. In our perspective, if we
weren’t a part of it, it means much less to us than what others expect.

Conference. Once a bulldog of a
league, the SWC has been reduced
to a sniveling little pup because
of the penalties imposed on its
members. In all likelihood, it will

- be disbanded within the next few

years.

Also, at press time there were
rumors that Florida State, one of
the top draws in the country, let
alone the Metro, is jumping ship
to join the Southeastern
Conference. .

Then there’s the ACC, which is
considering expansion of its
football membership. The ACC
sounds a little better on the

surface, with schools like Duke
and North Carolina as members.
But at least four of its members
have also been reprimanded by
the NCAA. After the NC State and
Maryland scandals, I would hope
Pitt would want to stay clear of
that league. ,

That leaves the Big Ten, which
has said it will not consider
expansion until the mid-1990s,
and the proposed Eastern
Seaboard league.

The problem with the Eastern
Seaboard is that i.t will have to
start from scratch. It’s a lot easier,
not to mention cheaper, to just
join an existing league.

Which leaves us with the Big

Ten, probably regarded as the
top a11—around academic and
athletic conference in the country.
All 10, excuse me, all 11 of its
members are in the AAU. Besides,
we can't let Penn State gain any
advantage on us, now can we?
‘ Pitt has survived for 100 years
without a conference, so why not
wait a few more years to see what
the Big Ten has to offer?

Remember Panther, the first or
biggest steak isn’t always the
juiciest.

Continued from page B-10

The federal education budget was cut consistently through the era
when we were in school —— why would we consider education
important when our country didn’t?

At this point in our lives, we seem to be experiencing “leftovers”
or “reruns.” Music and clothing styles keep returning as well as
“revamped” jargon (groovy)! “Originality” does not seem to be a real
hot item right now. And, believe it or not, we’re held accountable for
that. Remember those that are a generation or two ahead of us? They
made their dent in the world — when are we going to make ours?

By now, you’re probably thinking, “Enough of this; this opinion is
too heavy, too much to handle.” You're right. But this is only one side
of what's going on with us right now.

I’ve heard that our generation is “there,” we’re just waiting,
watching and looking for that “right” moment to “fix” everything that
we view as screwed up. We've seen too many mistakes made by too
many people to just dive into something, anything, without knowing
what we’re in for first. We assess, evaluate, challenge and watch very
carefully; perhaps so carefully that it looks as though we’re not doing

anything at all. We’re one of the most highly educated generations -

in a long time — we must know something about something. We’ve
got the potential, but we just haven’t bothered to use it yet. In other
words, the sparks are there; with a little bit of incentive, the fire will

light.  

I’m sure that past generations have had many similar feelings and '

experiences when they were in the “twentysomething” bracket.
They’ve experienced doubts, hesitation and anticipation of what lies

ahead of them. They’ve_ dealt with these feelings, however, and ,

worked past them into the “tl1irtysollnething” stage and so forth.

Our generation will probably experience many of those same
“growing-up type of things,” but for now, we’re all that we’ve got. The
world can be a not-so—friend1y place, and we recognize that. We do
have more concerns than just what we’re going to wear on Saturday
night.

We’re going to figure out how to fix those things that are troubling
us, though, sooner or later. We, as well as others around us, just need
to wait‘until that spark catches fire. Then we’ll show you —— in our
own way.

BAS

Continued from page B-10
being that BAS is needed to
counter these circ/zumstances. My
example arises from my
experience of trying out for the
Pitt baseball team. There were
about six African-Americans
trying out in the fall; there were
none left after December. But
from what I gather they could
have saved their time, because
they were generally not wanted.
Again, in this situation, like in the
first one, the racists around me
did not identify me as being
African-American and this
enabled me to experience things
that darker-skinned brothers

couldn’t. What I experienced
during this time was what I found
typical around the university.
When Keith, a darker-skinned
African-American trying out, was
around, he was always “Keith.”
But a mysterious thing happened
when he was gone. He all of a
sudden became “nigger,” among
other things. Some of the players
—andI do not mean to indict the
whole team, for there were some
players with character on the
team, [...l would smile * in a
brother’s face and talk about him
behind his back. Quite typical
here at Pitt. What is not typical,
but still too common, is hearing

racist remarks from Pitt staff or
faculty. Generally, anyone
working for the university who
has racist tendencies is smart
enough to keep his/her mouth
shut to avoid being ﬁred, but the
[former] assistant inﬁeld coach
for the baseball team [wasn't].
During a conversation on the
way to practice I heard him ask,
“Who in this car would date a
nigger?” Now, while the others
scrambled for witty rebuttals, I
began thinking to myself, “How
can this guy make an unbiased
decision about any player?” It
was clear to me that the inﬁeld
was going to be a “lily” white

College

come here out of desperation —
this is all that is left for them.

But it is not. It is a lie. There is
much more at the university, and
there is also more outside the
university. This is a place of
experience, a place you will never
come in contact with again. You
must forage, for yourself; you
have come here alone.

I only say this because this is
my own experience. I came to
the university to get away from
my hometown, to experience
more, to know more. I ﬁgured at
such a large university, no matter
what I wanted to do, it would be
available here. I was right.

I am beginning my senior year
at Pitt and hope to graduate at the
end of it (with what, I’m not quite
sure). Sure, I'll have a degree, but
more importantly, I have gained
the experience and knowledge
of how to deal with the real
world.

My freshman year took me for
a spin. My roommate got pregnant
by October of her first term,_but
decided to stay in the confines of
her dorm since it was prepaid. I
had been caught in the midst of
her predicament. Two months
into her bedridden pregnancy,

she miscarried and failed out of
that term. Relieved of her

company, I transferred my»
quarters the following term to the

Towers, and there I met the

people whom I would live with

during my sophomore year.

School-wise I was having my

ups and downs. I managed to
completely blow off some classes
and fail a few of them. School to
me had become quite a nuisance
and a game of grades —— more
politics than education. Granted,
we play our side of the politics.
Students are just as willing to take
the easy road as are professors. It
seems to be a struggle sometimes
just to get what we want.

My junior year was centered
around studying. I didn’t have
much else to get involved with. I
lived with one of my roommates
from the previous year, and we
became very good friends. On
Jan. 1, 1990, she was hit by a car
and killed. She was the first person
in Pittsburgh to die in the new
year.

This of course rocked my boat
incredibly. It made me rethink
everything that was going on. I
started classes, mocking all of it
in my mind. Mocking the students,
the professors, the T.A.s. All of

them thought they were going
somewhere. They followed some
hierarchy. They thought that they
actually meant something in the
scheme of things.

Well they didn’t — not to me,
anyway. Everything that they
talked about, every viewpoint
they held seemed to be a ﬂash in
the pan. I sat there thinking,
“What does all this mean _to me?”
Why do I care what these people
have to say? The professors meant
no more to me than the other
students. When it comes down
to it, they still don’t.

That is what I want to tell you.

You have to make it work for
you. Forget about the apathy of
the '80s. Forget about the yuppie
dream. Forget all about the
expectations you had before you
came to college.‘ You are here for
your own sake. When you
graduate — if you do — you will
be as alone as you’ve ever been.
But here there are others who are
alone like you, others who don’t
know their futures, like you. And
others who need friends, as well
as you do.

News.

group, and by spring the team
roster had followed. (It may be
important to note that some steps
have been taken to eliminate the
problem, therefore [to] any
minority players wishing to try
out, I fully encourage it.)

Admittedly, it is a struggle to
progress for any group at the
university, but what makes the
African-American community
unique, to a degree, is that we
have to struggle simply to
maintain the status quo. This is
precisely why we need the Black
Action Society. Struggle for us
has to be a group effort, carried

out through some agency. So for
those who criticize having a BAS
— remember, we only provide
protection, support, program-
ming and other various things
that the university generally
denies us. And for those who still
want to challenge my accusations
about the shortcomings of the
university, I think you need to
read through the examples again,
for they are examples of what
can happen, and will, when
racism is left unchecked.

State.” Temple University has the
first white student union.

Pitt is also not without its
incidents. It is not unusual to see
racist remarks scrawled in
Towers’ elevators. A Bisexual Gay
and Lesbian Alliance co-president
received death threats, and the
group's desk was vandalized

These are just a few of the
incidents that have occurred in

.the last year on U.S. campuses.

With the fact that social
harmony is not in the future and
intolerance is on the rise, colleges
have come up with the idea of
“diversity teaching.”

At Pitt, freshmen watch a
diversity video and take a course
called Freshman Studies where
diversity issues may be touched
upon. But the questions now
are: How effective is it, and are
we teaching it too late?

Diversity is often pushed onto
the sidelines of freshman
orientation, where discussions
are shufﬂed between registration
and giant twister. How much
actually sinks in is questionable.

Unfortunately, as we are ﬁnding
out, students often aren't ready
to face different cultures or
lifestyles head-on and lash out in
the only way they can -- through
hate. Since 1985, campus
harassments, which involve
everything from vandalism to
death threats and physical
violence against minority
students, have increased up to
400 percent, according to studies
done on 250 U.S. campuses.

Some universities have altered
their basic requirements to
include courses in women's or
black studies for graduation.
Others have chosen to increase
the number of minority faculty in-
an effort to spread diversity
throughout all areas of the college,
rather than in specific
departments. «Yet others feel it is
enough to hold “cross- cultural”
weeks, which tend to resemble
ethnic food fairs. Although these
are all steps in the right direction,
the reforms are coming around
too slow and in too few
universities. While we wait, a
new generation of racists, sexists

and homophobes enters society.
An answer to when we should
start teaching our children
diversity is obvious — as young
as possible .Children are not born
knowing how to hate; it must be
taught through their socialization.
It is true that teaching some
diversity is better than none at all,
butI think we can do a lot better.
One way to start is to require
diversity classes throughout
schooling and have greater
punishments for hate—motivated
crime on campus. Often when an
incident occurs that does not
involve physical or property harm,
such as sexist, racial or cultural
epithets, offenders are required
to write a paper as punishment,
and the incident is forgotten.
As more minorities are
admitted, college campuses are
much more diversified than 20
ago, and hate and
misunderstanding are growing.
Reagan-era youth are taught to
be very afraid of anything foreign
or different than stereotypical
American values. They lack the
sense of history that might help

them to be more sensitive, such
as experiencing the racial injustice
of the '60s or the progress of
women in today’s workplace.
Let's face facts; if we can't get

along in an open environment.

like college, we won't be able to
get along anywhere else.

of these are not even aware that
they are HIV positive and can
spread the infection to others. In
coming years, as the majority of
these HIV cases turns to AIDS
and as increasingly more people
become infected, the AIDS
epidemic could create an
unmanageable demand on the
health profession.

Additionally, cancer and heart
disease are not infectious; they
cannot be passed on in utero to
innocent babies. They typically
strike an older age group, not
people just starting out their lives.
While those diseases do deserve
large research budgets, AIDS
deserves more funding.

As college students, we need
to show the government that we
support increased AIDS funding
and research. Equally important,

we need to increase our own
AIDS education and rid ourselves
of homophobia and other
ignorant attitudes that only
worsen the epidemic. Nobody
deserves AIDS, and it should be
thought of as the disease it is and
not a punishment for “sinners.”
The most positive aspect of
AIDS, if there is one, is that in
most cases the disease is
preventable, as we all know, by
using condoms and clean
needles. It’s extremely important
that we make our contribution to
stopping AIDS by following these
safe practices. Because as
researchers have so grimly
reminded us, although significant
progress is being made, we can’t
count on a cure anytime soon.

Saddam Hussein: Anatomy

Yes, the Middle East has another
madman on the block. His name
is Saddam Hussein, leader of Iraq.

Now, let’s take a quick look at
his 11-year reign of power. Two

 

Jeff
Tatusko

months after taking over in a
military coup d’etat, he sent troops
into neighboring Iran over a
border dispute. That war lasted
for eight years and cost 1 million
lives and $1 billion. In that war,
he was accused of using nerve
gas and various other chemical

weapons to exterminate the
opposition on a large scale. Nice
8113’-

In 1981, one of his pet projects,
an atomic reactor capable of
making nuclear weapons, was
blown out of existence by the
Israelis. Score one for the good
guys.

This summer he was accused
of buying devices that are used as
triggers for nuclear devices. He
also allegedly tried to purchase
metal tubing to be used to make
the _largest gun in the world, a
supposed 1,000-millimeter
cannon.

Now he has taken yet another
step toward becoming a world-
class bully. After a two—week
dispute over oil and territory, he
launched an offensive into the
tiny, “big threat” nation of Kuwait.

This is kind of like Texas
invading Delaware. Iraq has
approximately 1 million men in
its army. Kuwait has a 20,000-
man army. Iraq is_ 30 times as
large as Kuwait. The only thing
Kuwait is guilty of is being the
only country in the world with a

SAUDI ARABIA}

ofa

higher standard of living than the
United States. Yet Hussein has
seen fit to invade and replace the
government with its own stooges.
A Now, needless to say, this hasn’t
been a popular move around the
world First and foremost, Hussein
has lost his one true friend and
major arms supplier, the Soviet
Union. He has been condemned
by NATO, the Warsaw Pact, even
the Arab League. The United
States and the Soviet Union, in an
unprecedented move, made a
joint statement condemning
Hussein.

Ah, but wait a minute.
According to Mohammed al-
Mashat, the Iraqi ambassador to
the United States, these are all
lies. “We didn’t invade Kuwait;”
he says, “we were invited in by

B-15.

'world   class bully’  

students who said they overthrew
the government.” Actually, I think
Hussein took the Kuwaiti tourist
bureau a little too seriously when
they said “Come to Kuwait.” (By
the way, those “students” were
supposedly seeking more
democracy for Kuwait, the most
democratic of the the Arab states.
Yeah, right.)

Tensions are mounting daily
in the region. Our country has
sent about 50,000 troops there
already, with more on the way.
We have also set up a naval
quarantine to stop all shipments
into Iraq (courtesy of an order
from the UN for all countries to
stop trade with Iraq) Many
countries already have some type
of military presence there. One
little incident could set off World

War HI.

So what does all of this mean
for the average Pitt student? Well,
right now the entire country is
watching gasoline prices
skyrocket. Around here, you
could get gas for— about $1 a

Draft violates human rights

At present, the United States does not have a
military draft. However, males between the
ages of 18Mand 26 are required by law to register
for the draft. When you apply for college
financial aid your draft registration records are

checked.

Draft proponents claim that the draft is the
only way the U.S. military could ever have

enough manpower to be able
to tight in a war. However,
during the early Reagan
presidency, a manpower task
force-neportshowedotherwise.
According to the report, even
if there were no draft
registration, if a war broke out
the military training camps
would be overﬂowing with
volunteers.

Another argument against
the draft is that drafted men do
not make good soldiers. In a
June 1987 letter to the editor in

The Officer, retired Lt. Col.
Gerald S. Parker, in writing
about drafted soldiers, stated,

“The motivation wasn't there. Even during the
war, a good many conscripts spent more time
thinking about when they could get out than
how well they could do their jobs.”

In addition to the practical reasons for being
against the military draft, there is another, even
stronger reason that I have for opposing it: the
military draft is a violation of human rights.

rightfully so. Kidnapping is indeed a very serious

If the government forces somebody to‘ go

referred to as kidnapping. But in reality, that’s

exactly what it is. Just because the government

For one thing, a person who is drafted is

taken away against his will. This is kidnapping,
which is defined as “the act or an instance of
stealing, abducting or carrying away a person

by force.”

Normally, kidnapping is considered to be a
crime. Anyone found guilty of it will usually
receive a long prison sentence (typically in the
range of eight to 20 years in Pennsylvania), and

is the kidnapper does not mean that it is right.
After being kidnapped, a person who is drafted

is forced to work against his
will. This is slavery, which is
defined as “control by imposed
authority.”

When Americans discuss
slavery, they are usually
referring to the pre-Civil War
condition in which‘ whites
forced blacks to work against
their will. Sometimes they are
talking about ancient Egypt,
where Egyptians forced Jews
to work against their will. '

Just as above, the draft is a
form of slavery, in which the
government is forcing people,
usually males in their teens or
20s, to work against their will.

The people involved may be different, but the
basic conceptis still the same: forced labor.

True freedom exists when each individual is
allowed to control his or her own actions. If a
person chooses to enter'the military, then that
goes along with the concept of freedom. If,
however, a person is forced to join the military,
then that is not freedom.

US Government paying the price for military cutbczc/es

Have you ever noticed how things aren't
always as they appear? Over the past
several weeks, I've seen many protestors
ranting and raving during the 45th
anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima
about how we should cut the defense

— budget. Many catchy phrases were used

such as, “The cold war is over!” and “Peace
is breaking out all over!" It's a shame no
one told Sadam Hussein how peaceful the
world has become. Before we tear asunder
the Pentagon’s budget, let's look at a few
things in the context of the events of the
past two weeks.

Shortly after the invasion of Kuwait,
President Bush put the 82nd Airborne
Division on alert. They are currentl)’

unprepared to face such an enormous
force of troops and armor. The 82nd has
no armor other than 55 severely
dilapidated, out-of-date and poorly armed
Sheridan reconnaissance vehicles. Why?
Congress has refused to allow procurement
of either one of the two tested
replacements for the Sheridan. As a
result, the Rapid Deployment Force must
either face certain doom or wait a long
time for mechanized assistance from Ft.
Stewart, Ga. _

Furthermore, deployment of these forces
is a major problem because of Congress’
failure to buy the new C-l7 cargo plane for
the Air Force or modern freighters for the
Navy. We don’t have enough hauling

vehicles to move large forces quickly; so
the Air Force must stretch its resources in
a mad attempt to equip our forces before
all hell breaks loose.

Apparently, congressional representatives

Tom Lester

would rather ignore Navy demands and
buy sexy F-14 ﬁghters that can be
subcontracted in many congressional
districts than ugly but badly needed
freighters that are built only in one area
like Norfolk or San Diego.

Finally, in its rush to cut Pentagon
“waste,” Congress eliminated the SR-71

Blackbird spy-plane program. This plane
can go anywhere in the world, take pictu‘_ijes
of even the smallest vehicles and have the
photos in the Oval Office within 90 
Now, we must depend on satellites whqse
ﬂight paths may not be over Iraq at? a
particular time to fill the enormous void
left by the elimination of the SR-7l.

Let's remember that even though the
Soviet Union has become less hostile, we
have other enemies.

Ignoring this threat doesn’t promote
peace but rather the needless
endangerment of U.S. forces.

Thomas Lester is a senior history major.

' If there is anyone involved with
Pitt football who should be biting
their nails, pacing back and forth
and worrying intensely while
experiencing sleepless nights,
who would it be?

Not Alex Van Pelt, who is cool
as can be, it’s not head coach Paul
Hackett nor is it the season ticket
office; they’re well ahead of last
year’s current sales.

The man who would most likely
fit the above—mentioned profile is
secondary coach Nick Rapone.
He has just one worry.

“The only concern we have is
that we don’t have any
cornerbacks that have played
against the people that we have
to play,” Rapone said.

“You talk about concerns, that’s
our first problem. We lost two
starting corners; we have to find
kids that can play and we have
very little experience to draw
from.”

With the exit of Robert Bradley
and Alonzo Hampton due to
graduation, the present
cornerback situation is quietly
rivaling the offensive line’s plight
for the dubious honor of “biggest
question mark entering the 199Q
season.”

Talk to the players and they’ll
give you the same old story about
how they’re ready to play, that
they have enough game

experience, that there's no
problem at all. But if the coach
expresses concern, then everyone
has a problem. In short, the head
honcho is not comfortable with
the present situation.

On the current depth chart,
senior redshirt Marcus
Washington and junior redshirt
Dave Coleman are listed first at
left and right corner respectively.
Both appeared in six games each
last season and started none. They

tallied 17 tackles between them, '

but no quarterback sacks,
interceptions, fumble recoveries,
etc. etc.

Cause for concern? They don’t
think so.

“lThe. coaches] are expecting
big things from me,” Washington
said. “I was a starter in spring
practice and I came tojohnstown
as a starter also. So right now, I’m
a player with a lot of experience
under my belt. I want to come out
of here as a starter. I don’t think I
have to prove anything here [at
camp], just to play to the best of
my ability.”

Head coach Paul Hackett has
some worries of his own when it
comes to his secondary.

“Experience is the word, the
corners are the opposite of our
safety situation. Marcus is playing
there for the first time. He is a
proven player and made a great
contribution lastyear as a nickel
player. But he’s going to have to
have a great camp,. he’s

THE prrrmnws, oxmNrAnoN%1ssUn,.*Mz5tia§y,.Atigti§t?2*7;?~19*9og

vulnerable.

“It’s an experiment. Can he do
it over and over again for 60
minutes, that’s the question,”
Hackett said.

Coleman’s job may be the
position in the state of jeopardy.
Ju nior redshirt Steve Israel’s knee
injury has apparently healed and
he has been most impressive at
Johnstown. Coleman sustained a
neck injury in the spring, but has
since recovered.

“We feel very comfortable with C

David. He's not spectacular, but
David is solid as a rock as he’s
consistent and he’s going to be at
the right place andhe’s going to
make the plays. Of course Steve
Israel is the guy that’s going to
push him all you can," Hackett
said.

Coleman acknowledged that
he expected to be hearing
questions and doubts raised about
his ability due to his inexperience.
However, Coleman has been with
the team for four years and has
been able to watch many excellent
players illustrate the way the
position should be played.

Still, he has a big question of his
own. , —

“[My biggest uncertainty] is
making the big play in big games.
Certain games I've been in haven’t

really been that important. When '

the big time comes along and I
have to make the big play, will I
make it?” he said.

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

When one thinks of a running
back, images of someone taking
a handoff and plowing through
the line or sweeping around end
for a first down are usually what
comes to mind.

And indeed that was the case
last year for Curvin Richards and
Ronald Redmon. Richards ran for
1,282 yards, his second straight
1,000—yard season, and Redmon
picked up 145 of his own as a
part-time fullback.

But their offensive talents don’t
end there.

The tandem of Redmon and
Richards combined for 51

1989 —— accounting for almost 60

_ percent ofPitt’s returning offense.

And they were only sophomores.

That the two are both excellent
rushers and receivers is rare, and
combined with the fact that Pitt.’s

offensive fuel tank is running a.

quart low on wide receivers this
year, the pair should team up to
be a high-octane weapon for
1990.

“They’re a pretty good
backﬁeld,” said running—back
coach Tommie Liggins. “I don’t
know how they’ll compare to
other teams around the country
because I haven’t seen anybody
else yet.”

Liggins is back to coaching the
running backs this year after a
season ofdirecting the tight ends,
and said this backfield compares
favorably to those he’s coached
in the past. I

Liggins. “I’ve had Ironhead [Craig

Brown [Washington Redskins]
together, and this one is up there
with them.”

The Sponing News has named
Pitt’s backfield, including
sophomore quarterback Alex Van
Pelt and all backups, as the 10th
best in the nation. Not bad for
three starters who still have seven
years of combined eligibility left.

Although Redmon and Richards
are great receivers and great
running backs, the similarities end
there.

While Richards gains Heisman
and All-American‘ attention. with
his stylish and flashy play,
Redmon sits back and does his
own thing, not minding that
Swervin’ Curvin gets all the
limelight.

“I don’t mind at all; my main
objective is to help win games,”
said Redmon. “Curvin deserves
all the credit he gets. I’m just happy
to be able to contribute to the
team.”

A former coach stated that
Redmon was the kind of player
who would have a quiet college
career and then go on to have a
steady pro career. But the NFL is
about the last thing that Redmon

_ thinks about.

“I don’t think about it at all; it’s
far out ofmy mind,” said Redmon,
who possesses a rare combination
of speed (a 4.5 40—yard dash) and
strength (bench presses 375
pounds).

I-Ie evolved into one of the
team’s leaders last year, and
Liggins has described him as a
“coach on the field.”

“My goal is just to remain
healthy,” said Redmon. ‘‘If I can
do that and help the team achieve
its goals, all the individual goals
will fall into place.”

Meanwhile, Richards is
climbing the charts in Pitt’s record
book almost faster than he can
run the 100-yard dash (10.7 see).
He already has four of Pitt’s top 20
marks for most yards rushing in a
game. Only Tony Dorsett has
more (10), and Dorsett only had
three after his first two seasons.
Richards’ 2,510 career rushing
yards is already good enough for
fourth best on the Panthers’ all-
time list, and he should move into
second place ahead of Craig
Heyward and behind Dorsett near
the middle of the season.

“You always want to do as well,

but preferably better [than the year

beforel,” said Richards. “As far as

0 I'm concerned, my main objective
is for us to go to a better bowl
game this year.”

While both Redmon and
Richards could be stars in their
own right, they work well
together, another asset for Liggins
and the offense.

“They’ve worked together long‘
enough to know what the other

will do," said Liggins.

“We’ve been together long _

enough now; so Curvin can tell
which way l’ll block," said
Redmon. They’ve only been doing
it for a year.

Opponents still have two more
years of the R&R Express coming
their way. ‘

Cream of the crop...

Pitt's best players to embark on special teams throughout year

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Big problem No. 1: Colleges
don’tusuallyrecmitspecial-teams
players.

Big problem No. 2: How do
you make special teams an
effective weapon?

Big problem No. 3: \5(/ho do
you put on special teams?

Well, times change, people
change and yes, football teams
change.

Special—teams coach Scott
O’Brien, in his fourth year with
the Panthers, is going with a
recent philosophy of assigning
the best players to the special
teams unit to provide, if you’ll
please pardon the pun, a new
kick in Pitt’s overall game plan.

The concept is not a new one
as far as football goes, but it is a
relatively new concept in

DALMO

Pittsburgh.

The basic principle which
provided the impetus for this
system is the fact that college
teams usually do not actively
recruit players specifically to fill a
role on special teams.

Every employer wants the best
man for the job, and this year,
O’Brien will follow that old adage.

“The biggest reason for [that] is
it’s like any position offensively
or defensively, you look for
certain players to fill a position
where you can utilize their
physical attributes,” O’Brien said.

“The problem is [that] on special
teams, you can’t go out and recruit
those kids. You go out and recruit
offensive and defensive players
and players who will fill those
needs for you with their physical
abilities,” he added.

Dic/eersonis long battlewitla Algebra
finally over: eye now on the QB slot

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

The phone rang in Darnell Dickerson’s apartment
on Monday night, Aug. 13. It was Paul Yuna, director
of Pitt’s Academic Support Services on the line —-
with good tidings.

“I was so excited I could hardly even sleep that
night,” said_Dickerson, who was told that he would
be eligible again to play football for the Panthers in
1990. The next day, head coach Paul Hackett heard
the news.

Tuesday night, Dickerson arrived at camp. He
wasn’t expected to arrive until Wednesday morning,
but he couldn’t wait to get to camp and get out on the
field. Dickerson couldn’t even remember when the
last time he had thrown a football was; he guessed
spring practice in 1989.

“I’m happy, happy to get here. I didn’t know what
to do all week long. I was just panicking all around,”
Dickerson said.

It’s been 15 months since Dickerson was

suspended by College of Arts and Sciences Dean
Mary Briscoe for failing to receive the required
grade (C— or better) in Algebra for Continued
enrollment at Pitt.

During that period Dickerson played minor-
league baseball as a catcher in the Kansas City
Royals organization, worked as a landscaper and
attended the Community College of Allegheny
County.

This summer Dickerson was allowed to re—enroll
at Pitt, and he took the Algebra course along with
four others.

The past is finally settled for Dickerson, but now
it is the future that looks cloudy for the Detroit,
Mich., native. After passing for 1,599 yards and
rushing for 555 more as a sophomore in 1988,
Dickerson is now looking in from the outside. Alex
Van Pelt had a remarkable freshman year in 1989,
and it will take a‘Herculean effort tounseat him at
starting quarterback.

Then there is senior Scott Stark. Stark transferred

Sestili ready to take on veteran role With offensive line

By Jason Hillman
The Pitt News

Last year’s offensive line was
one of the strengths of the Pitt
Panthers. Three of these players
were drafted by NFL teams: Dean

Caliguire (San Francisco 49ers),
Chris Goetz (San Diego Chargers)
and Roman Matusz (Chicago
Bears).

This year’s offensive line is
considered one of the biggest
question marks. Only two starters

time together. That poses a 

problem for Meyers.

“Timing in the offensive line is
quite different than any other
position,” said Meyers. “The
reason being that in any sport,
including football, you can
rehearse your skills prior to the
season. In baseball you can bat,

That takes a lot of timing and
work. So we always start behind
the rest of the football team and
then, as inexperienced as we are,
that probably doubles it.”

Sestili however, remains
confident. “We’re all young, and
we know that people are talking
down at us and we’re going to be
the weakness of the team. We
don’t look at it that way. We look
at it as we're the strength of the
team and we’re going to get this
season going,” he said.

The job of offensive lineman is
obviously not a glamor position.
No lineman has ever won the
Heisman Trophy, but their
contribution is crucial to the
success of any football team.

“What we do reflects Curvin,
reflects Alex,” said Sestili. “Those
guys aren’t going to take all the
credit and just push us aside

leadership role. Last 

 

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

With names like Craig Gob,
Ricardo McDonald, Curtis Bray
and Nelson Walker, it’s no wonder
the Panther linebackers have
earned the tag of “deepest and
most experienced group on the
field.”

However, certain people feel
otherwise.

“If we had everybody healthy,
it would be a different story,” said
inside linebacker coach Sal
Sunseri. “But with the healing
process of Bray and Mike Boykin,
we [as coaches] don’t look at our
situation as that deep.

“So waiting for them to come
back and get healthy will add that
depth to the linebacking corps.”

Bray has an arthritic knee and
has played with the inﬂammation
since his sophomore season.
Boykin must deal with a
reconstructed knee.

Bray is slightly ahead of his
teammate recovery-wise because
surgeons “cleaned his knee out”
after the John Hancock Bowl last
season. He was practicing on a
limited basis in Johnstown.
Coaches hope to have both
players back at full speed by the
middle of the season. Sophomore
Charles Williams is expected to
fill in for Boykin.

“We do have some people who
have played a lot of football, but
we’re trying to develop some
depth so we can give our starting
four a breather  and get Bray
and Boykin back to really add
some depth and give us six quality
players plus the young guys
coming on,” said outside
linebacker coach Marvin Lewis.

The linebacking unit will be of
utmost importance this season, as
the Panthers will shift to a 34
defense most of the time under
defensive coordinator Fred
vonAppen’s new scheme.

Sunseri, an All-American
linebacker at Pitt in 1982, is in his
sixth season on the coaching staff
and is optimistic as to what and
how his players are learning in
training camp.

“It’s a new system, and they’re
doing pretty well. Most
importantly, they have to
understand how a defense should
be running to the football. Coach
vonAppen has set a precedent by
having a system and a standard
on how he wants a defense to get
to the football, and the players
have reacted very well,” Sunseri
said.

The biggest obstacle in the new
plan is playing over opposing tight
ends. Previously, the Panthers
were primarily a 4-3 defense
where the linebackers played off
the line of scrimmage and didn’t
have to pass rush or line up over
the tight end. In a 5-4 defense, the
linebackersimust take on some
different duties.

A major adjustment for this
year’s unitwill be learning how to
redirect the tight ends coming off
the line of scrimmage.

“We’ve got to get used to playing
over tight ends, We're just
learning the defensive package
because the coaches just put it in
over the spring,” said Walker.

  “"3 '1'" NEWS» ORIBNTAHON ISSUE. Mondav.’.Av£mst 27. 1990

‘Deep and experienced’ a misnomer for linebacking corps

“We’ve got it down pretty well,
but they’re still installing things.”

McDonald was of the same
opinion. “I think our biggest
weakness now is developing our
pass problems. We’re
concentrating on playing over
tight ends, and that’s something
new to all of us. Picking up the
receivers coming out on pass
routes is our biggest adjustment,”
he said.

Senior Prentiss Wright, the
unanimous choice as the
emotional leader of the defense
by teammates and coaches alike,
was originally slated to play
outside linebacker, but has since
moved to the inside at UP].

Wright, at 5~foot—10, 215
pounds, is of medium size as far
as linebackers go, but he certainly
got the job done last season. He
recorded 48 tackles (35
unassisted) last season while
appearing in all 12 games, but
starting only one.

Wright’s biggest asset is ‘his
speed, not to mention his game
intensity. I

“Prentiss has pretty good
instinct,” Sunseri said. “He’s not
that big of a guy, but he runs
pretty darned good, so that adds
another speed guy on the field.

And when we go into nickel
situations, he’s going to be one of
the guys who plays the running
back man-to-man on-the weak
side or he’ll be in zone coverage.
The biggest thing he adds to us is
excitement and speed.”

Yet another possible impact
player is Terrance Wheatley, who
sat out last year as a redshirt. He
performed well in spring practice
but still had much to learn,’
according to Sunseri.

‘Wheatley did not arrive in
Johnstown until Monday, Aug. 13
(three days late). Under NCAA
rules he was not allowed to don
the pads until Thursday, Aug. 16.
Mentally, he had some catching
up to do under vonAppen’s
system, and that is the coaching
staffs major concern.  A

‘‘It’s just like if a guy“doesn’t
sign a contract [in the pros] and he
misses camp play, he’s behind.
So Terrance has a lot of catching
up to do. He’s a good football
player, but mentally we have to
get him on the program,” Sunseri
said.

But Wheatley is ready to go.
"They chose to sit me out last year
and I think that helped me more
than anything. And this year, I'm
justeager to get in there and show
what I can do," he said.

Wheatley was a four-year
letterman at Martin [Luther King
High School in Detroit, MI. He
spearheaded the defense for a
team that compiled a 9-0 record
and won its first city league
championship and made its first
state playoff appearence.

He earned first team All-State
honors in addition to being
selected All-City, All—Metro and
All-Midwest.

But getting all of this year’s
linebackers, veterans or not, on
vonAppen’s new program will be
a major concern for Sunseri and
Lewis as the defense charts new
territory in the playbook and on
the playing field.

  

Jason Hillman/l‘ he Pitt News
Craig Gob will call the defensive signals this year, in addition to serving as the nucleus of the linebackers.

Proposition 48 met with mixed reviews by athletes

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

For Sean Gilbert, it was a case
of hardly being able to even
watch a Pitt football game from
the sidelines last year.

5‘I wouldn’t go to a lot of games,
just because I would get stressed
out. On every play I would think
‘If I were out there, maybe I
could have had a tackle on that
play, or maybe I would have
sacked the quarterback there,”
said Gilbert, who was one of
three Pitt- football players to sit
out the 1989 season because of
Proposition 48.

Prop. 48 is the guideline that
the NCAA instated in 1986 which
sets minimum academic
requirements for incoming
freshmen. Athletes must score a
combined 700 on the scholastic-
aptitude test and maintain a 2.0
quality—point average in high
school in order to be athletically
eligible to play. A

Under the guidelines, athletes
deemed ineligible are banned
from participating in all team
activities and must forfeit one
year of eligibility if they accept a
scholarship.

In short, the athlete is stripped

of his right to perform in the Offensive lineman Lamont

a Parade All-American and USA

the Panther defense.

Entering fall camp this year,
Gilbert was listed second on the
Panthers’ depth chart ‘at right

troubles and will likely be ruled

both sides of the ball this season,
O’Brien may be in a better
position than he thinks. He has
quite a gene pool to pick from if
the Panthers are going to use
their best players on special
teams.

O’Brien has previously worked
with special teams and
linebackers on every stop of his
personal coaching tour. His first
stop was at the University of
Wisconsin-Superior from 1980-
82, then to Nevada-Las Vegas
from 1983-85, then Rice in 1986
before joining Pitt in 1987. He
was signed by the Green Bay
Packers in 1979 and the Toronto
Argonauts a year later.

T 0 O’Brien, this special-teams
philosophy is not new.

“It’s always been done that

way. I started coaching in 1980 at
UWS, and it was the same there
as it was in Nevada—Las Vegas,”
he said.

Since the system has yet to be
tested on a grand scale here, its
strengths and weaknesses are not
readily visible.

“I don’t really know if there are
any speciﬁc strengths at this point.
I suppose the real strength is the
number of kick returners. We’ve
never had so many returners
before people with great
explosion and speed that we need
now,” he said.

Certainly, guys like Glenn
Deveaux, Steve Israel and
Jermaine Williams will be potent
weapons in the return game. The

returned a kickoff last year.

Indeed, picking from this select
gene pool may be one of O’Brien’s
biggest tasks.

“The biggest weakness is that
we don’t have specific teams yet.
So when you’ve got a certain
team, you’ve got to feel the
continuity there, which will
probably turn into your biggest
strength,” O’Brien said.

But how many of the other
coaches are happy about their
prized players being plucked to
perform on special teams?

Outside linebacker coach
Marvin Lewis is facing reality.

“At the linebacking position,‘

we have guys who are generally
a little heavier-bodied types but
can still run; so they play a big
role in special teams. It’s not a
different philosophy from other
places where I've coached; so
you come to expect that as a
linebacker coach. ‘

“When you have a meeting
going on [in training camp], you’re
not going to have your players
available because most of them
are going to be involved in special
teams. Hopefully, we’ll have
enough good players to spread
them around during the season,”
Lewis said.

And speaking of heavier-
bodied types that can still run,
the 6-2, 230-pound Ricardo

‘ McDonald is looking forward to

throwing his weight around on
kickoffs, to help the team,
naturally.

But McDonald also has some
subtle personal goals he hopes to
accomplish in the future, and he
believes playing on special teams
will help him attain those goals.

“I want to play kickoff, and I
think this’ will work to my
advantage because I'm planning
on going to another level [pros];
I feel that this is going to help
me.”

But for now, players and
coaches alike will be looking to
“Raise the Level” for the
immediate future. And the new
special-teams philosophy will
hopefully be one of the strong
arms.

Trio of tight ends all share potential for number one spot

By Scott Campbell

Asst. Sports Editor

Ifthere is one slogan that the Pitt Panther tight ends should use this
year, it would have to be “strength in numbers.”

Where the wide receivers are lacking in experience, the tight ends
more than make up for it, a quality that head coach Paul Hackett
intends to put to good use.

“We consider that we have three starters at the tight—end position,”
said Hackett. “That is probably our deepest position. Last year we
played some without a tight end in there, but this year you’ll find that
we’ll have at least one in there, a lot of times we’ll have two and
sometimes we may even have three in there.”

The trio of Lionel Sykes, Eric Seaman and Dave Moore has

combined for 59 receptions, 26 more than tight ends had in the past

two years combined, and the most for Panther tight ends in at least
five years.

“Ifthey. keep throwing us the ball, we’ll keep catching it,” said tight-
end coach Chuck Jones. “Our tight ends are receivers, not glorified
tackles or blockers.”

“We’ll all play equal amounts of time,” said Moore. “We each have
certain situations that we specialize in. I’m a little better at motion
blocking, but the other guys are better at getting off the block.”

Despite a seemingly obvious place for an atmosphere of competition
for the “No. 1 spot,” they say that this is not the case.

“With the offense now, we’ll use a lot of multiple tight—end
formations. We’ll all catch our share of passes,” said Seaman. “When
one of us catches a ball, the others know that they had a part in it also.
You can’t look at it from an individual standpoint. We have to work
as a unit, not as three guys.”

“They’re more of a team within a team,” said Jones. “I’ve been
impressed with the way that they share information. They all know
that they’ve got to help each other. Say if one of them is out there for
a play and sees something, he’ll come back and tell the others what
to look for.”

For the moment, Sykes gets the title of the “No. 1 guy” on the depth
Chart. ‘

“Lionel has really good speed; he’s probably the biggest and fastest
of the three, and he knows the offense as well as any of the three,”

said Jones. “He’s shown himself to be a leader by example.”

Super Soph...

One of college football's best ready for an encore

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

What could possibly be next for Alex Van Pelt?

An unproven redshirt freshman entering the 1989 campaign, the 19-
year—old went on to lead the Panthers to an 8-3-1 record, including a
victory over Texas A&M in the John Hancock Bowl, all the while making
many fans exclaim, “Darnell who?" M

Indeed, the future of the 1989 Panthers was a questionable one after
Darnell Dickerson was declared ineligible to compete by university
standards in May of 1989.

However, Van Pelt emerged to make his dramatic mark in the records
and statistics departments. He broke former Pitt All—American Dan
Marino’s single-season passing
yardage record of 2,876 yards by

determined.

Speaking of the offense, one of this season's goals is to establish the run
in order to create other offensive opportunities. The ground attack is the
core product in Hackett’s view, and that product's primary ingredient will
be junior tailback Curvin Richards.

With good reason. Richards has rushed for 2,510 yards in his two
seasons and has moved into fourth place on Pitt’s all-time career rushing
list. -

Van Pelt is well aware of the jewel of the Panther backfield and cited an
early and general offensive plan for the year while keeping Hackett’s
goals in mind. 8

“We’ve got Curvin back there; so you can't say we’re going to be
throwing the ball 50 times a game because if Curvin doesn’t carry the ball
' 25 or 50 times a game, it’s injustice
because he’s just too good,” Van

throwing for 2,881 yards. Van Pelt
also threw for more than 300 yards
four times. Former Panthers
Marino, Matt Cavanaugh andJohn
Congemi each had_only three 300-
yard passing games in their entire
careers.

Van Pelt wound up 17th in the
nation in pass efficiency with a

Pelt said.

“Curvin will see the ball more
out of the backfield because
anytime you can get the ball in the
running back’s hands as far as
receiving goes, we want to take
advantage of that because he’s the
best runner on the field. So if we

Associated Press and to The
Sporting News’ freshman honor
roll.

After such an impressive first-
year effort, expectations for what
many authorities call “one of the
best quarterbacks in college
football” are running high. Fans,
coaches and media alike are
expecting more great things from
the man at the helm of the offense
this season.

As for Van Pelt himself, his
attitude off the field is much akin
to his demeanor when he is
playing: cool under fire.

“I don’t read what people write
because if you start believing it,
then you’ll slack off, like [head]
coach [Paul] Hackett says. There
lisn’t any] pressure, and I don’t feel
any,” Van'Pelt said.

Coming from Winston Churchill
High School in San Antonio, Texas,
to captain a Division I NCAA team
for a season was quite a thrill for
Van Pelt. However, one cannot
live in the past or rest on one’s
laurels. And Van Pelt is living
testimony to that philosophy.

“[Last year] was exciting; I
wouldn’t trade it for anything in
the world. But it’s a different team
and different circumstances now,
and last year is past,” he said.

As for this year’s goals, Van Pelt
is looking to better some areas of _
his individual performance and, of course, the team’s.

“If I’m in a bowl Jan. 1, then l’ll be happy. There’s a few things like
completion percentage that I need to increase [1926/i7, .553 last year] -
interceptions ll 2] and mistakes I need to cut back on. But basically, I want
to be in Arizona, Miami or New Orleans on Jan. 1, and that’s our goal,”
he said.

With the addition of Dickerson to the team’s roster this season, many
interesting situations will arise offensively, including the possibility of
Dickerson at quarterback. However, unscating Van Pelt will be a lofty
task, but he welcomes the competition.

“Competition is always good for everybody. it’s going to be fun. There
are a lot of opportunities that will be determined at camp. Anytime you
get an athlete like Darnell on the field anywhere, he’s going to contribute
to the offense," Van Pelt said.

“We’re going to take everything slow with Darnell,” l Iackett said. “He’s
up against one of the top quarterbacks in college football. In practice,
Alex throws short, he throws deep, he’s in control in the backfield —— he
does everything. So we’re just going through an implementation process
with Darnell right now.”

Dickerson waspracticing as a quarterback during morning practice
and with the receivers in the afternoon atJohnstown. His role is yet to be

Alex Van Pelt will battle Darnell Dickerson for quarterback assignment.

against Rutgers last year and he
goes 69 yards [54 yards, actually]
and breaks 10 tackles, you’ve got to
like those percentages,” he added.

This year’s receiving corps is
lacking in game experience, and
receptions as a result. In fact, of the
top three receivers last year, the
No. 2 and 3 spots were occupied by
members of the backfield. And the
holder of the top spot, Henry Tuten,
is long gone, having graduated.

A That leaves senior ﬂanker
Hosea Heard, who caught a total of
two passes last year, and
sophomore split end Olanda Truitt,
who pulled down 19 catches for
383 yards, as the “veterans” of the

/receiving unit.

The Panthers could have been
helped tremendously in that area
had top receiving recruit Chris Jones
enrolled at Pitt. However, Jones did
not meet Pitt’s academic standards
and decided to take his business to
Miami, Fla. Van Pelt was a major
force inJones’ recruitment and took
his departure a little personally. '

“[’I'heJones situation] hurt me.
I helped recruit him, and I made a
lot of calls and became pretty close
with him. But_Pitt has a standard of
academics that Coach Hackett and
[athletic director] Dr. [Ed] Bozik
stand behind, and they’re not going
tomake any exceptions. For Chris’
circumstances, I think they did what
was best for him,” Van Pelt said.

In attempting to aid the

receiving group, former tailback Ricky Turner has been moved (perhaps
temporarily) to the flanker position.

But if all else fails, Hackett may have to resort to more drastic measures.
When answering questions at a press conference about Dickerson and
Van Pelt, Hackett said in jest, “Who knows, maybe Alex will play a little
receiver.”

After a storybook freshman season, don’t count on it.

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

At 6 a.m. on the campus of the
University of Pittsburgh at
Johnstown, the sun hasn't even risen
yet, but 102 Pitt Panther football
players have.

For two weeks they will eat, sleep
and breathe football 24 hours a
day. Welcome to fall camp,
sometimes known as hell.

At this early hour the players
trudge toward the student union
for a mandatory breakfast, carrying
both playbooks and a lingering
expression of drowsiness, the latter
the result of six (at most)
hours of sleep the
previous night.

After breakfast, and for
the next two and a half
hours, the players are at
various times gathered
in clumps scattered
around the practice field,
each headed by a
different position coach.

Practice is divided into
12 timed periods, each
one devoted to a
different phase of the
game.

“I’ve been to several
camps [during] my
career; so I have a few
ideas on the way they
should be run,” said head

‘coach Paul Hackett. “Our
goal is to give maximum

the players focused on
what has to be done in
order to be able to
execute.”

For the next two
weeks the ﬁeld will be
their classroom, but it
will also be their
battlefield.

Bring up the topic of camp, and
most players shake their heads and
groan, “Oh, man.” 'ihat’s it, and that
sums it up without wasting too
much energy.

Tempers run short in this
environment, evidenced by a free-
for-all brawl on the first day of hitting
in pads. Players have to look good
for the coaches and want to look
good for each other. Twenty—two
spots for 102 players doesn’t stretch
very far.

After the first practice, the players
trudge through the woods looking
like a regiment of soldiers that has
just lost a war. They are given an
hour break to lick their wounds,
catch their breath and fill their
stomaches again to counter the loss

of weight that they experience after
every round. Some also resort to
sleeping for a little while if there’s
enough time.

“You learn as you get older to
find time for an extra 15-20 minutes
of sleep if you can get it,” said junior
tight end Eric Seaman.

“Let me tell you, sleep is one of
the most cherished things around
here,” said offensive tackle Mike
LiVorio.

Two hours after lunch comes
another practice session, this one
held under an August sun ‘blazing
down with the same heat and
ferocity as the action on the field.

For the players it may seem like
boot camp —— or worse — but
Hackett and his assistants are getting

their point across.

“It’s demanding all right, but if
we didn’t love the game, we
wouldn’t be here,” said sophomore
defensive end Keith Hamilton.

“It’s part of the territory,” said
offensive lineman ScottMil1er, “You
want to be a football player; you
have to be ready.”

For 14 days the players are

confined to the campus, tucked

away in a comer of this steel—making
and coal-mining city. There are no
stores, houses, traffic or any other
signs of civilization within
reasonable walking distance to
distract the players.

“We want to keep them right here,
together and busy from 6:00 in the
morning until 11:00 at night,” said

C-15

Hackett. “We try to provide a
mental discipline as well as a
physical one. We try to get them to
concentrate for long periods of
time. It’s not easy to pay attention
for two and a half hours at a
meeting or at practice if you're
tired.

“Now on Sundays it’s a different
story. We give them a little more
time off, to go to a church service
if they want or whatever, " he said.

After the second practice the
players get another hour break for
dinner, but then specia1—teams
players are back out on the field
again for a third time.

Jason Hillman/F he Pitt News

Following the long afternoon practice, the players hike up the hill for team meetings and dinner.

Then there are the meetings.
The players meet with their
position coaches every day for a
real classroom drill.

So when do you study your 800-
page play book? You find time.

At 11:00 it’s lights out, but many
players have already fallen asleep
from exhaustion by that time.

“As soon as the meetings are
over, whether it’s 9500 or 10:00 or
whatever, we’re in bed,” said
sophomore center Chris Sestilli.

As night falls and scores of weary _
bodies begin to heal themselves,
the campus is silent.

But even before the night is over,
in a few scant hours, alarm clocks
will sound and the cycle starts
again.

lnexperienced receiving corps looks to make name for itself I

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

Some say that this year’s
receiving corps will be

inexperienced. But of course
that’s like saying that there is
some unrest in the Middle East.

With the departures of Henry
T uten and Reggie Williams, the
transfer of freshman recruit Chris
Jones to Miami, and the academic
problems of Baron Jackson, the
remaining group enters 1990 with
less respect than Rodney.
Dangerfield ever had.

Olanda Truitt, a sophomore
who saw limited action in the first
half of last year, and Hosea Heard,
who has played in just six games
during the past two seasons, are
the veterans of this year's squad.

Veterans? Well, somebody has
to be, and they are the only‘ two
returnees who caught balls last
year. *-

It seems the only people who
expect this group to have great
seasons are the receivers
themselves and their coaches.

“Don’t countusout, ” said Truitt.
“Every one of us is capable of
making the big plays.”

“Obviously we’ve got a lot of
young guys there without a great
deal of game experience,” said
receivers coach Skip Peete. “But
they all have thetalent. We’ll just
have to wait and see how they
react in a game situation.”

Truitt, who finished with 19
catches and 383 yards last year,
including four receptions for 124
yards in the John Hancock Bowl
against Texas A&M,\ is expected
to be the Panthers’ main and
long-distance threat this year at
the split—end position.

“The way things are looking,
I'd like to catch 50 balls this year,
maybe 800 to 900 yards, 10
touchdowns,” said Truitt, smiling.
Truitt’s sense of humor and
penchant for the spectacular catch
should also make him a crowd
favorite. .

Heard is looking to close out
his career on a positive note,
after missing many of his playing
days as a result of academic and
personal problems with former
coach Mike Gottfried.

He caught 16 passes as a

‘freshman in 1986, but only six
receptions a year later, four of ‘

them for touchdowns.

That would be the last action
Heard would see until last year,
when he caught two passes for
24 yards.

Heard earned the starting-
flanker spot entering fall camp
by impressing Peete and head
coach Paul Hackett in the spring.

“What impressed me about
[Heard] is that he worked hard

.while we were off,” said Peete.

“From the time last season ended
until the start of spring ball, he

Football team gets a taste of game situations in scrimmages

By Jeffrey Shurilla
For The Pitt News

The football team got a taste of game
action on August 18th when they squared
off in an inter-squad scrimmage at
Connemaugh Township High School near
Johnstown. It was a chance for the team
to work on timing while the coaches got
a chance to look at the second and third
teams.

The first team defense went up against
the second team offense, led by
quarterback Scott Stark. The offense at
first was stagnant, as the defensive front,
led by Keith Hamilton and Sean Gilbert,
controlled the line of scrimmage.

“The defense I thought at this point
should be ahead of the offense,” said head
coach Paul Hackett, “it hasn’t been the
case up until now because the defense is
a new system, the offense isn’t. Butl think
today you saw the defense handle the
situations pretty well.”

At one point the offensive line was
overwhelmed, as defensive coordinator
Fred vonAppen experimented with placing

Hamilton and Gilbert on the same side of
the ball.’ The result was success, with
Gilbert taking out the line, giving a
Hamilton a clear shot at the quarterback.

The secondary played well in general.
Louis Riddick was in All-American form
with several tackles and an interception.
Steve Israel is quickly ascending to the top
of the depth chart at right cornerback.
He was listed number three at the start of
cam p, but he played well enough to impress
Hackett and earn some time with the
number one defense.

“He did about four things, blocking ﬁeld
goals, laid himself out, knocked down
two balls. Steve is just so ready after what
he’s been through. I’m just thankful the
injury thing is behind him and now we can
just concentrate on the season,” said
Hackett.

The second team’ offense did show
some spark late in the scrimmage. Glenn
Deveaux scored on a five-yard run and
Stark hit split end Warren Ware with a 25-
yard touchdown pass through the heart of
the secondary. Ware is a red shirt freshman
who wasn’t listed on the depth chart at the
start of camp..

Walk-on fullback Lance Markel also
saw some time. He had a 15-yard run
against the nickel defense and carried the
ball on the next play for another big run,
but fumbled after being stripped. He also
scored on a one—yard run.

“Lance Markel was a pleasant surpise,”
said Hackett. “He just kept pounding in
there and that was against the number
one defense. He’s making a move trying
to assert himself to become part of the
team.”

The number one offense and second
team defense saw considerably less time
on the ﬁeld. Curvin Richards was in mid-
season form, bouncing off defenders at
the line of scrimmage and sprintting into
the end zone.

Hackett said quarterback Alex Van Pelt
played “very average” and he thought the
offense would be more “in tune.”

The special teams had some problems
on both sides of the ball including a
botched punt, a bad snap to the holder,
two roughing the kicker penalties, a
dropped kickoff and freshman kicker Ted
D’Alessandro had a field goal blocked.

Some bright spots were found on special
teams. Brian Greenﬁeld got off some good
punts and Scott Stark was effective on
short kicks, dropping the ball inside the
10—yard'line. Scott Kaplan was good on all
his point after attempts.

Special teams coach Scott O’Brien

implemented new personel on field goal ‘

attempts. He used Hamilton and Gilbert
on the ends to protect the kicker from the
outside rush.

This was the first of two Scrimmages

scheduled by Hackett. The second was set

up for the last day of camp, August 23rd.

Camp Notes:

Darnell Dickerson was in pads for the
first time at the scrimmage, but did not
play...He had yet to wear a red jersey
symbolizing “quarterback status” and
worked with receivers after practice...On
the third day of pads, 190 pound wide
reciever, Olando Truitt, knocked out 240
pound linebacker Ricardo McDonald
during normal contact. . .Truitt’s teammates
call him “O.T.” for obvious reasons...The

ﬂu was also going around camp. .r

Prop 48

Continued from page C-11
Marcus Washington and Ken
Abrams.

Despite having to sit out and
forfeit a year of eligibility, the
three remain divided on their
opinions on the effectiveness of
Prop. 48.

“Sure I’ll miss the year, but
rules are rules,” said Gilbert. “I
knew what I had to do, but I just
didn't get it done.”

“I wouldn’t necessarily say that
it was unfair,” said Lewis. “You
have to have some standards to
get into a college.”

Liggett on the other hand is a
bit more outspoken on the
subject.

“I think [Prop. 48] is very unfair.
I took a black-studies course, and
it showed that the average white
person scored a 930 on the SAT,

while the average black score
was only 630; so yes, I think it’s
unfair,” said Liggett.

“What hurt the most was being
told that you had the opportunity
to contribute right away, but then 
you’re told that you have to put it
in the closet until next year,” said

Gilbert. “You’re told that you
can’t do the one thing that you
love to do the most.”

That “next year” is here now,
and only time will tell if or for
how long the year off will put the
players at a competitive

disadvantage because of nod,

previous playing time.

“I don't feel that we’re at a
disadvantage,” said Lewis. “We
prepared for the physical beating
we have to take. All we need now
is the experience.”

Awards are nice, Hamilton says,
but he knows they mean nothing
this year to him, vonAppen or
any of his teammates.

“You can’t dwell on those. This
year I heard that they say I’m the
No. 1 defensive end in the country
l T2'9eNFL DraﬂRep071 has deemed
him as such]; how can they say
that? Half of the people who vote
for that have never played a
down of football in their lives,”
said Hamilton. “And a lot of
people talk about a sophomore
jinx; I don’t believe in that. You
make your own route. If you stay
intense, things will work out.”

Last year defensive coordinator
Frank D’Alonzo used Hamilton
mainly as a pass rusher, but this
year Hamilton says he won’t be

’ so quick to monopolize that task.

“[Coach vonAppen] is going to
open it up a little this year, give
some other guys a chance,” said
Hamilton. Pitt has moved to a 3—
4 defense [three defensive
linemen and four linebackers]
this year, and the linebackers
will often be called upon in a
blitzing situation to rush the
quarterback.

“We have one of the best
coaching staffs in the country 
if not the best,” said Hamilton.
“Coach vonAppen demands a
lot; you either do it his way, or
you do it no way.”

Philly Connection recruits arrive inform of linebackers

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

You know the old story.

Highly touted football recruit
comes fresh out of high school
and is expected to make an
immediate impact at the college
level, while he battles with
incumbent upperclassmen for
playing time in training camp.
Eventually, the new 18-year-old
fulﬁlls everyone’s expectations
and enjoys gridiron success.

All the while, the kid is cool
and calm, bringing forth every

. cliche imaginable so as to keep

his nerves-of-steel image and
perhaps his sanity in the public
eye.

But what are these kids really
thinking? Is it really possible to
remain so cool and conﬁdent as
one makes the big move from
high school to THE major
gateway to professional football?

Aug. 10, 1990. Pitt Stadium.
Media and photo day. A 6-foot,
205-pound freshman is standing
among his fellow linebackers.
They are all situated on the 30-
yard line to serve as prey for the
media, who are granted free
access to everyone on the ﬁeld.

But no one is talking to the
freshman. He’s not paying much

attention anyway. He looks like
he’s in a trance, pondering the
56,500-seat stadium,‘ the feel of
the new $2 mi1lion—plus artiﬁcial
turf surface, and admiring the
look of his team in this year’s
fresh, new uniforms. Must look
like an awful long way from St.
John Neumann High School in
South Philly for Hayes Clark.
Clark arrived at Pitt along with
Charles Williams of Valley Forge
Military Academy as two top-
linebacking recruits for this year.
Clark was considered one of
the top linebacker prospects in
the‘ East. He was selected by
SuperPrep as one of the top ﬁve
at the position and was chosen
first—team All-Catholic and
second-team All-City by the
Pb iladeljob ia Daily News.

  

 

But all those impressive
credentials don’t cover up a
genuine young man who is a little
unsure of his future.

“Sometimes I just look around
and wonder if I belong here.
People say how good I was in
high school, and I see all this
talent out here — makes me
wonder if I’ll ever be as good as
some of these guys are,” Clark
said.

Maybe a case of being a big fish
in a small pond? Who knows? But
the size and conditioning habits
of Panther veterans led Clark to
willfully admit that his former
training program left a lot to be
desired.

‘'1 never lifted any weights in
high school, and out here
everyone is so big; and I just look
around, and I don’t believe it all.
It’s like going from elementary
school to the pros out here,” he
said.

Williams, a 6-foot—3, 240—pound
individual who bench presses a
cool 360, was regarded as one of
the top scholastic football players
in eastern Pennsylvania. He was
a high—school All-American in
addition to being selected to play
in the Big 33 All-Star game. He
recorded 110 tackles, five
quarterback sacks and one

interception last season at Valley
Forge.

Williams believes he’ll fit in at
the college level due to his
discipline and training at the
military academy. However, he is
well aware that he has stepped
into an entirely different league.

“At military school, we played
with post—grads and with a couple
junior—college teams. But up here,
these guys are much, much bigger.
It’s a totally different situation,”
he said.

Both V players’ eventual
enrollments at Pitt were marked
by an effective recruiting process,
which pulled no punches or
reeked of stomach—turning rah-
rah hype about the university. In
fact, the genuine demeanor of
both players and coaches alike

proved to be an invaluable asset
in acquiring these two talents.

“I’ve been a Pittsburgh fan all
my life,” Clark said. “Steelers,
Pirates, you name it. But I really
wanted to go to [the University
of] Maryland, but my visit here
changed all that.”

And when Clark and Williams
speak of their visits here, one
veteran’s name always comes up
as a determining factor: left

[Jeff Esters] -— they’re the main
reason I came to Pitt. It wasn’t a
fake school that brought me here,
because football is football no
matter where you go. It’s the
people that make a difference,”
Williams said. ’

“Those guys were really nice to
me. It didn’t seem like it was a
fake to me because a recruiter’s
job is just to be like a machine,
and it wasn’t like that. Those guys
went all out for us. That genuine
atmosphere was why I came to
Pitt,” he added.

Clark was quick to echo

Williams’ comments. “Nelson
showed me around, and I liked
the whole environment; and it
just seemed like a family here.
[Special teams and defensive lit? "1
coach O’Brien was the main
reason I came here. There’s just
something I like about him,” he
said.

Could the athletic department
be harboring some secret
recruiting tactics that only Walker
is privy to? Hardly. It looks like a
simple case of just being one’s

Israel looks to come
back from prior injuries

By Jason Hillman
T be Pitt News

Steve Israel’s football career at
Pitt has been, at the least,
memorable.

Three years ago, he was unable
to play due to Proposition 48. A
year later, he injured his shoulder
covering Hosea Heard in practice
and sat out the entire season.
Despite these setbacks, Israel
came back and won the starting
right—cornerback position and
became the kickoff returner in
1989.

In the first game of that season,
he ran the opening kickoff back
95 yards for a touchdown, which
was unfortunately nullified by a
penalty. It looked as if Israel
would finally be able to showcase
his talents for Pitt fans. Then
came the fourth game of the
season at West Virginia.

“West Virginia's turf is kind of
sticky,” Israel explained. “I went
to make a sharp turn, and I just
put too much pressure on [my
knee], I guess, and it went out.
No one tackled me. I was already
on the ground before anyone
even touched me,” he said.

The result was another long
vacation for Israel. In three years
at Pitt, he has been able to play in
only four games.

In those four games, Israel
returned 11 kickoffs for 235 total
yards. That's a 21.4 yards per
return average if you're
counting.His longest runback was
47 yards.

“I've been playing the game

since I was 5 years old,” he said. I

“I’ve never had any type of surgery
or any major injury until I came to
college. I love the game so much,
and it’s part of the game; so I’lf
just take it in stride.”

One thing in his favor this year
is that his injured knee hasn’t
appeared to hamper him during
the early part of training camp.
Tests given by strength coach
Guy Bennardo indicated that his
“bad” leg was stronger than his
“good” leg.

The 5~foot-11, 18S—pound
redshirt junior is being welcomed
back with open arms. His most
immediate impact will be felt by
the special teams, where he is
expected to be a dangerous
returner on both punts and
kickoffs. He figures heavily into
Paul Hackett’s philosophy of
aggressive special-teams play.

A running back and defensive
back in high school, Israel was
asked to play cornerback when
he came to Pitt. But as a defensive
player, he wasn’t going to be able
to handle the football as much as
he did in high school. So last year
he began returning kickoffs. He
returned 11 for 255 yards before
the injury at West Virginia. This
year he plans to expand his role
as returner.

“Being that Alonzo Hampton
and Henry Tuten were our punt
returners last year and they’re
both gone, I felt as though I
would like to try to return some
punts also. It’s the only wayl can
score touchdowns besides
interceptions.”

Israel has found the addition a
challenge. “Punts are much more
difficult,” he admitted. “They’re
much higher, and they curve
different ways. They don’t drop
right to you. You have to look
them in more.”

Special—teams coach Scott
O'Brien is happy with Israel’s
adaptation to punt returning. “He
has to understand the scheme
and where his help is going to
be,” he said, “but as far as catching
the ball, he's a natural.”

“llsraell has great speed, but he
hits top speed within his second
step,” said O’Brien. “That’s the

difference. The greatest returners I

in the country have that ability to
be at full speed so fast.”

“Steve immediately can be an
impact player for us,” said head
coach Paul Hackett. “From every
report that we have and mainly
from the gleam in Steve’s eye,
that knee is ready to go. It’s time
for him to make the contribution
he’s capable of making.”

Even with all the emphasis on
his contribution to special teams,
Israel is focused on winning back
the starting-cornerback position
now held by Dave Coleman.
“lCo1emanI is a good guy, and he
had an excellent spring,” said

nday, August 2'/_*, 1990

It ’s time...

   

Jason Hillman/T he Pitt News

Steve Israel has been able to play in only four games in three years at Pitt due to injuries.

Israel. “But he was there last year,
and I beat him and Robert Bradley
[who started at corner in 1989
after Israel’s injury] out of the job.
I did it once; I don’t see why it
couldn’t be done again. a
S “I don’t want to be a dime or
nickel man. I want to be a starting
corner. But I’d do anything to
contribute to the team,” he said.
His presence shores up a young
and inexperienced secondary.
Secondary coach Nick Rapone is
planning to use several different
teams, like a nickel and a base
team. He figures Israel “will be
able to fit in to one of these
spots.”

Frazier’s an/er/town status pats placekicking up for grabs

Byjason Hillman

T be Pitt News

Scott and Ted are friends.

That doesn’t seem like a big
deal until one realizes that_Scott
Kaplan and Ted D’Alessandro
have only known each other as
competitors. Both are trying to
become the placekicker for the
Pitt football team.

“We happen to get along real
well,” said Kaplan, a redshirt
sophomore. “We’re good
buddies. Kickers in the past, we
haven’t all been great friends, but

Ted and I enjoy each other’s
company."

With Ed Frazier’s status
unknown, Kaplan and
D’Alessandro find themselves the
top two contestants for
placekicking duties. Kaplan was
Pitt's placekicker in 1988, but had
trouble adjusting to kicking
without a tee and was redshirted
when Frazier became the starter.
With Frazier gone, Kaplan is now
listed first on the depth chart.

“It’s very comfortable,” said
Kaplan of his new position in
camp. “I was No. 1 two years ago.

It’s not anything I haven’t
experienced before; so it’s not
like I’m in a state of shock or awe.
It’s something I expected.”

But Kaplan will feel pressure
from D’Alessandro, a freshman
from Bethel Park. D’Alessandro
was the No. 1-rated placekicker
in SuperPrep and was named to
both The Pittsburgh Press and
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette All-Star
teams. “ID’AlessandroI has a really
live foot,” said special-t"éams
coach Scott O’Brien. “But any
freshman, kicker or whatever,
always has to make that transition.
Socially, it’s a lot different for
them. Practice is a lot more
regimented. They’re trying to fit
in.”

D’Alessandro is happy playing
for Pitt. “This is where I’ve always
wanted to be,” he said. “It’s where
I’ve always wanted to play. ”

Both kickers have a good shot
at winning the job. “It’s wide
open,” said O'Brien. “Scott will
take the reps first and he’ll lead

. the competition. But when it’s all

said and done, the best kicker

had the most recall of anyone in
the group.”

After those two, well, that was
it—— literally. The team was in
such need for receivers that it
plucked former tailback Ricky
Turner out of the backfield.

will kick.

“In three weeks, I think we'll
have a pretty good idea. Both
Ted and Scotty are getting the
ball up off the ground, which is
important,” he added.

The pressure of such a
potentially close competition is
good preparation for the pressure
the starting kicker must face on
the ﬁeld. Often a kicker must
wait on the sideline in the fourth
quarter of a close game,
wondering if he will be called on
to win it all. “We’re the most
visible position, more or less,
except for a quarterback or
running back,”
“We’re the guys [whom]
everybody focuses on at one
point. We have one job and one
opportunity to do it.

“That’s what it’s all about. You
can be as physically prepared as
you want to be, but if you aren’t
mentally prepared,'you can’t look
forward to it. I think most kickers
would love to have that kind of a
situation, especially in the big
games.” ‘

Turner caught seven passes last
year for 78 yards and rushed for‘
139 yards while spelling Curvin
Richards and Adam Walker in the
backfield.

“We knew that [Turner] ran
great pass patterns. _He has pretty
good speed; he’s a physical run

0 Womens' volleyball looks to better last year's impressive season

TI-[E,PI'I'I‘ NEWS, ORIENTATION ISSUE, Monday, August 27, 1990

By Jeff Paladina
For T be Pitt News

Last year, the University of
Pittsburgh’s women’s volleyball
team had an excellent season by

,._ almost anyone’s standards. It won

1‘

V the postseason

the Big East championship,
finished the season with a record
of 31-10, (.756 winning
percentage) and came very close
to earning a seat in the NCAA
tournament.

However, the Lady Panthers did
earn a trip to the Women’s
Invitational Volleyball Classic,
which is equivalent to college
basketball’s NIT (National
Invitational Tournament). In other
words, they were a very close
second. They advanced to the
tournament semifinals before
being defeated by Wisconsin. All
in all, it was a successful season

r according to most. Nonetheless,
it was a season that this year’s
team is looking to better.

The 1990 team is ranked 19th in
the preseason Top—20 by the

. V0lleyballM0nt/alypoll, indicating
that this year’s squad boasts a
stronger chance at making the
NCAA tournament than last year’s
team did. .

In NCAA Division—I women’s
vol1eyb‘all,,32 teams qualify for

Sixteen of the 32 teams receive

automatic bids by winning their

,\ games last season. Stark also
earned the Ed Conway Memorial

Award as the most.-improved
player in spring practice.

Despite the long odds,
Dickerson wants to see playing
time as a signal caller this year.

“It's going to be a battle. I just
have to give it all I can,” said
Dickerson. “I’m not going to try to
over—do anything to try to go out
and beat [Van Pelt]. He's a great
guy and a great quarterback. You
can't take that from him.”

Dickerson came to Pitt as
Michigan’s 1986 Athlete of the
Year where he was all-state in
basketball and baseball as a senior

. atMartin Luther King High School.

Hackett said at the end of
Dickerson’s first practice this year
that he would spend two—thirds
of his practice time at quarterback
and the other third at wide
receiver, despite the fact that
Dickerson has never played the
position.

Does that bother him?

“Whatever position I have to
play to help the team win, I’ll play
that position,” Dickerson said.

Dickerson watched Van Pelt
with the other quarterbacks on
his first day of practice and took a
few snaps to get his arm loose
again, but he did not practice as a
wide receiver.

“I learned a lot from sitting out
that year. Academic-wise I knew
it was nothing to mess around
with. I know what I have to do

‘I now. A lot of people had a doubt

that I would ever come back, but
I proved a point,” said Dickerson.

respective conference
championships. The other teams
must try to get one of the 16 “at
large” bids. Last year, the NCAA
did not give the Lady Panthers an
automatic bid, but this year’s
conference winner will get one.
Simply put, if they win the Big
East Championship, they’re in.

The Lady Panther team is
comprised of two seniors, six
juniors and two freshmen. “We’re
not a big team by the numbers,”
said Coach Sue Woodstra. “We
have only 10 players, butwe have
a balanced team. We have a lot of
experience, and we have some
strong players returning.”

A lot of that experience will be
provided by the team’s two
seniors, setter Jenelle Lantagne
and middle hitter Michele
Adamson. The team will also have
two freshmen, Carrie Thorton
from North Huntington, Pa., and
Anna Marie Lucanie from Ontario,
Canada. Both are expected to
make an immediate impact.

Coach Woodstra outlined some

challenging and lofty goals for
the team. The first is to stay in the
top 20 the entire season. The
second is to play well and upset
some top-10 teams. The third is to
win the Big East and do well in the
NCAA tournament.

Assistant coach Sue Hoover
ﬂowed with optimism. “We have
good returning players and
promising freshmen coming in.
Our girls are hard workers and I
think that we’ll do really well this
year,” she said.

“We have a nice home schedule
this year,” added Coach Woodstra.
“I really hope that the students
and the people in the community
come out and support our team
because it is very rare to have a
team ranked in the top 20.”

For those who want to come
out and jump—start the Pitt
volleyball team in their quest to
reach the NCAA tournament, the
first home game, against Eastern
Kentucky, is Friday, Sept. 7 at 7:30

Soccer team ready to tackle toughest schedule ever

By Doug Miller
For T be Pitt News

With the addition of [WO top-20 teams to this
season’s schedule, the men’s soccer team will count
on every bit of experience it can muster to be
successful this year. Gone from last year’s 8-6-3
squad are Scott Armstrong, Sam Lanza, Mark
Mostinckx and perhaps last year’s most valuable
performer, Heinz Pak.

However, this year’s team is excited and ready to
prove that it belongs with the Big East’s
powerbrokers. Leading the charge into the Panthers’
toughest season ever will be sixth-year coach Joe
Luxbacher, who has compiled a 52-59-10 record
while at Pitt. He will be assisted by former MISL
Cleveland Force goalkeeper Bobby Campbell.

This season’s schedule doesn’t appear to favor
the Panthers, however, with the addition of the
northern Big East teams. Included in that group are
perennial top-20 powers UConn and Syracuse. Add
to that Boston College and Providence, and you
have a tough enough slate.

But the Panthers will also have to face perhaps
their biggest rival when they take on the Seton Hall
Pirates, who humbled the Panthers 8-1 at Seton Hall
last year. Throw in St. John’s, Villanova and
Georgetown, and you have either a dream season
or one that could make the fall look eternal.

“In this league, I strongly feel that anybody can
beat anybody. Obviously, Seton Hall is the best
team, but they are not unbeatable. Now that they
have to play Syracuse and UConn, things could be
real interesting standings-wise,” Luxbacher said.

The Big East Tournament, which takes place
from Nov. 2-4, will place the top four teams from the
final league standings against one another. Pitt has
never made it that far, but junior defender Scott

Jason Hmman/The pm News McCurry thinks this could be the year the Panthers
Jay Kapusta sends this ban via air mail ‘into the opponent's zone. iget their turn. “We return a lot of key players likejay

~.

[Kapusta], Mike lBlatzl, Huy Tran and Roberto
[Croce]. We really need to come out strong and let
our momentum carry us through the big games,” he
said.
Here is how the Panthers will look in the field:
GOALKEEPERS — Seniors Jay Kapusta and Tim

Sobelman will continue to battle for the starting
spot, with Kapusta having a slight advantage in the
number of games he has started. Sobelman is a
steady performer and plays a heady type of game.
Kapusta is often spectacular, hurling his 6-foot-2-
inch frame from post to post, making near-
impossible saves. Backing them up will be
sophomore Dan Martino and incoming freshmen
Ryan Fender and Walter Lehman. .

. DEFENDERS —- Being thrown to the lions early
will be much-heralded junior college-transfer Mike
Watson, who will have to step in and fill the shoes

of Heinz Pak at the sweeper position. McCurry will .

provide the defense with a combination of speed,
strength and a variety of slick moves at the stopper-
back position. McCurry was redshirted last year
with a fractured cheek, and it appeared that the
team sorely missed him. On the defensive wings for
the squad will be Croce, a versatile defender who

also has the ability to move into the offensive zone I

without losing any part of his game. In addition, the
Panthers will look to a combination of players
opposite Croce. Among those being considered are
juniors Carsten Bishop and Trevor Nash.

MIDFIELDERS —— This is where the Panthers will
generate the majority of their offense this year.
Without a doubt, this is the team’s strength, with
players such as co-captain Blatz.

Blatz has a strong leg and will be looked to once
again this year to provide some of the scoring

’ punch. Ivan Amayo also will be counted on this I 

year. Luxbacher said, “Ivan is very strong on the ball
and he has an excellent shot coming off the turn.”

“Mediocrit 

A thing of the past or Pitt men's tennis

By Paul Tatkovski
For The Pitt News

Putting “mediocrity” and “the
men’s tennis team” in’ the same
sentence used to be considered
redundant.

That parallel ended last year.

Pitt severed itself from that label
last season, winning 12 of 18
matches. You have to go back to
1984, when Pitt went 13-9, to find
a team with comparable success.

With five of the top seven
players returning, including No.1
Terry Rosenthal and No. 2 Jeff
Mills, another winning season
would be hard to bet against. How
much better can they be than last
year?

The new Charles L. Cost indoor
sports facility should help the team
considerably, said head coach
George Dieffenbach. It has nine
indoor tennis courts, making
weather-related practice and
match cancellations problems of
the past. Dieffenbach said the
indoor courts will help in
recruiting top players. Having
indoor facilities will allow Pitt to

increase the number of home
matches and tournaments, added
Dieffenbach.

Rosenthal, a sophomore from
New Jersey, is currently winding
down his tour of the national
amateur circuit. Mills played the
circuit as a‘ high-school senior and
last year as a Pitt junior. Mills said
the circuit lures mostly college
and some top high-school players
from around the world. Mills said
all the Pitt players have been
competing in tournaments this
summer.

Mills, a senior from
Brackenridge, Pa., recently won
Pittsburgh’s City Parks doubles
championship with Vivek Kumar,
a graduate from last year’s team.
Mills and Kumar finished second
in doubles in last year’s Big East
championships. Mills said one of
his major goals for this season is
to win the Big East doubles
championship.

He said this season he will team
up with either Rosenthal or Larry
Gerrard. Gerrard was the No. 6
singles player from last year, but
according to Mills, he is one of the

best doubles players on the team.

Also returning are the No. S and
No. 7 singles players, John Te gano
and Joel Orth, respectively.
Tegano, a junior from
Steubenville, Ohio, was the most
successful player last year with 14
wins.

Two spots opened by
graduation will have to be filled.
Dieffenbach said he has recruited
three good players: Felix Mescon,
from Silver Springs, Md.; David
Ginder, from Red Lion, Pa.; and
Alex Cobble, a transfer from..the
University of Tampa.

Dieffenbach said he has three
goals for the tennis team. “The
first goal is to graduate student
athletes. The second is to have a
winning record. And third is to
better the team's finish in the Big
East this year.” Pitt finished a
respectable ﬁfth in last season’s
tournament.

The season starts with a match
against Fairmont State on Sept.
11. Then the team will travel to
Weekapang, R.I., for the Big East
tournament Sept. 14-16.

Discovering the creative side of the University of Pittsburgh

By Dmitri Ragano
Showcase Editor

“Pitt” and “art” —— two words
not often associated. When the
topic of student art comes up,
one is more likely to think of
Carnegie Mellon University's
nationally known program than
of our own program located in
the lovely Frick Fine Arts Building.

However, the University of
Pittsburgh’s studio—arts
department has six full—time

faculty members, four part-time
and 30-45 undergraduate majors.
It is a small program with a core
of energetic, enthusiastic teachers
and students.

“We are an art department in a
liberal—arts situation,” says
Kenneth Battista, director of the
studio—arts department. “We're not
here to train designers.”

If a student isn’t sure whether
to make art his or her life, the
liberal-arts setting allows the
student to explore other areas of
learning. “Part of being an artist is

being exposed to other fields  I
think what ,we’re getting out of
college might be a little more,”
says studio—arts major Alithea
Weiland, who is in her seventh
year at Pitt. Sometimes students’
academic pursuits become a
subject for their art. Studio-arts
major Melissa Ralke’s interest in
quantum theory and Einstein’s
theory of relativity can be found
in abstract paintings with titles
such as “Mass, Movement, Sound
and Their Counterparts.”

In an art school or intensive,

pre—professional art program like
the one at Carnegie Mellon,
students would devote their
attention almost completely to
art, spending 100 hours of their
college careers in the studio and
20 in the classroom. At Pitt, a
studio—arts major spends 20 hours
in the studio and 100 in the
classroom.

“The end result is that a person
leaving the University of
Pittsburgh has a different kind of
knowledge. I’m not saying one is

Had your fill of bars packed
with men whose testosterone
levels rise with each 25-cent draft
they down? Reached your
saturation point with frat parties
teeming with women whose
frosted eye makeup glows eerily
with every toss of their mousse-
soaked hair? Then clue yourself
into a personal guide to all that is
tragically and definitively hip. The
most tragic and the most hip are
listed for your convenience
according to their
1 o c a t i o n
within the
city.

adventure and tragic coolness,
then please peruse the following:

Downtown/ North Side

Metropol: A safe place to show
off your ordinarily concealed belly
button. Its self-styled Friday night
Panic Bar _ offers “industrial
dancing in a post-nuclear
atmosphere.” This place is a
Mecca for the 21- to 30-year-old
fashion—conscious crowd. Dress
in black and get there early. After
11 p.m. the cover ‘charge goes
up. They also offer all-ages shows
for those who are not yet legal.
Located on Smallman Avenue in
the Strip.

Allegheny Brewery and Pub.-
Old German theme bar featuring
hardwood ﬂoors, German food,

, Saturday

and beer brewed on the
premises. I tried the pub’s dense
homemade beer once, and
compared to the pale,
commercial brands, the flavor
was strong, resembling ale more
than beer. If your musical tastes
run from German folk to jazz,
pull up a bench, order the
bratwurst and a stein, and enjoy.
Located on Troy Hill Road in

‘the North Side.

The Strgo District on a

morning:

The reason I em-

phasize the morning part
of Saturday is because if you get
there any later than noon, you
may experience a panic attack
due to the huge number of food
lovers gathered there in the four-
block stretch of groceries,
bakeries, meat markets and
outdoor food markets. Also, if
you're searching for a great
“find,” outdoor flea markets are
held there regularly.

Roberto Clemente Park.-
Located in the North Side, this
place is cool because you can
walk on a deck around the river
at night and see all of the
buildings and lights of
downtown Pittsburgh.

Shamrock Inn.- The biggest
plate of spa ghetti’ for your money
and a funky salad bar (although
I believe they might still be
using tuna that isn’t dolphin
safe). On the other side of the
restaurant is a bar where you
can slide up fer yer favorite

brew and mixed liquids.
Bloomﬁeld! Garﬁeld

Tessaro’s.- Screw the oat bran,
and prepare your body for a
cholesterol feast guaranteed to
push your blood levels to toxic.

anyway, so

out this place located on Liberty
Avenue in Bloomfield. Tessaro’s
offers the widest variety of
hamburgers in Pittsburgh. The
burgers are huge (1/2 lb.) and

each one comes with a variety of *

t_oppings.

Thomas Merton Center:
Pittsburgh's peace center, located
in Bloomfield on Liberty Avenue.
If you’ve followed Molly Rush and
the Plowshares 8 and Vince Eirene,
as well as their campaigns for
peace in the local news, then you
may be familiar with the center as
their inspiration and unofficial
headquarters. Named after the
philosopher and monk Thomas
Merton, the center serves as an
information network for all peace-
related activities. You can buy T-
shirts and bumper stickers bearing
messages in support of social
justice, or browse through the
books bearing the writings of and
about Thomas Merton, Nelson
Mandela, women’s rights, Marxism,

Allegheny Cemetery: Located in
Garﬁeld, this cemetery is loaded
with history and is set in a rural
area within the city. Stephen
Foster is buried here, as well as a
soldier from the Revolutionary
War. In addition, some of the
grave markers border on the
bizarre, like the anchor marking
the grave of a rear admiral, and
the tombstone carved in the shape
of a shark.

South Side

St. Elmo’s Bookstore: All that
you could hope for in alternatives:
unusual literature, photography,
magazines and music. This
bookstore is not for the faint-

hearted. Its stock includes an

entire section of gay and lesbian
literature, magazines for
Deadheads, material on women’s
issues, new-age music and books
on some goddess-centered
religions. The store is well~
organized and the staff is quite
knowledgeable. There is no

‘ pressure to buy and get out;

rather, it has a relaxedatmosphere
where patrons can look over their
possible purchases without
someone breathing down their
necks. It is not a mainstream
bookstore. This place is very hip.

will leave you wondering if you’re
in the 19905 or back in medieval
Europe. Jess and Katherine, the
store’s owners, provide some
stunning original art and sculpture
based on Celtic pieces. On certain
Celtic holidays, they will also
hold small concerts and open
houses, which the public is
encouraged to attend. For the
true taste of the Celts’ culture,
browse through this store just

around the corner of 11th and '

Carson streets in South Side.
Bloomers: A female- owned
and -operated establishment.
They serve the very best hummos
in Pittsburgh. This bar sponsors
many events, ranging from

psychic fairs to performances by .

local musical artist Anne Feeney.
Lots of strong women speak out
here, and if you’re faint of heart
and can’t stand to see two women
occasionally kiss each other, then
maybe you’d better make your
own hummos at home in your
own sexually insecure shell.

St. "M icbael ’s Cemetery: Located
in Mt. Washington, it was featured
in the movie Dominic and
Eugene. You can see the entire
city of Pittsburgh from this
graveyard. There aren’t a lot of
distracting crowds here either.

Herman Pearl may be best
known on the local music scene
as a member ‘of Chill Factor
International, one of the area’s
favorite reggae music bands, but
he has hopes that all eyes will
soon be turned toward his newest
project: Soy Sos Global Sound
the growing
popularity of reggae and rap
music, both nationallyand in
Pittsburgh, the market is primed
and ready for something like Soy
Sos, which features both rap and
reggae artists doing their thing in
front of grooves and rhythms
crafted and mixed by Pearl.

“I like both reggae and rap,”
Pearl says. “I’m not necessarily
crossing the styles, but I’m doing
both. In the last three or four
years there’s been a lot of
crossover between reggae and
rap — everything from the Fat
Boys doing reggae to Jamaican
DJ reggae being inﬂuenced by
rap, by its beats and such.” He
goes on to explain that this new
reggae is being called “Dance
Hall Reggae” and that it has
become much more electronically
oriented than the traditional forms
done by Bob Marley, the Wailers
and others like them in years
past. “The reggae of today is
produced in the studios,” he adds.
“That’s what "Soy Sos Global
Sound System is made up of.”

It seems that Soy Sos is made
up mostly of Herman Pearl, since
he is credited with all the
composing, assembling and
producing on the cassette, as
well as a lot of the mixing. Doing
the rapping are some friends he
made as he played and traveled
with Chill Factor. Program one is
titled “Hip Hop” and contains
three songs. Two of these feature
L.G. (a.k.a Lamont Germany) at
the mike rappin’ about “My Main
Objective” and “The Momentum,”
with the third done with cool,
rhythmic style by Shawn D. Both
rappers write good lyrics and
perform them cleanly and
precisely. The mixes are creative
and somewhat complex, with
most of the material actually put
together by Pearl in his own
home studio.

The second program features
the fast-talking DJ style of
Bubbles, an up—and-coming
reggae singer from London.

“Bubbles [whose real name is _

Tony Dunnl is only 19 years old
but has been DJ-ing for four or
five years now; so he’s got a big
future ahead of him,” says Pearl.
“DJ” is a Jamaican version of rap
done to reggae—sty1e music. DJ
has also been called “ragamuffin,”
which just happens to be the title
for this three—song program.

So where does the name Soy
Sos come from?

“It's a nickname I got from the
guys in the band [Chill Factorl,”
Pearl relates. “I used to be a strict
vegetarian.” .

Pearl hopes to push sales of the
cassette when Graffiti hosts a
show featuring both Soy Sos
Global Sound System and Chill
Factor International on Sept. 14.

He says to expect performances.

Pitt student ﬁlmmakers make most of modest setting

By Matthew Myers
Staﬂ“ W1-iter

The film-studies program in
the College of Arts and Sciences
is neither nationally popular
enough nor large enough for Pitt
to promote in one of its top-10
lists of national recruiting
attractions. Its total of 52
undergraduate majors seems like
an insignificant number when
you consider Pitt’s enormously
successful and equally respected
science and health schools.

But since its inception in 1980
as a self-designed major, the CAS
film—studies program has grown
steadily, albeit unnoticed by most
of the university community. It is
a fate shared by such CAS
programs as women’s studies and
black studies, in which much-
deserved recognition seems lost.

The fact is, however, that
enrollment in film studies at Pitt
has almost doubled in the last
three years.

Because it is an interdisciplinary
major, film—studies students can
expect to take 36 credits in various
categories, such as film history,
national cinemas, selected
filmmakers, themes, genres and
theory.

Besides the scholarly pursuits
of cinema, coursework in film
production is offered to all CAS
students through a special
arrangement with Pittsburgh
Filmmakers Inc., a media-arts
center in Oakland. Through this
non—profit organization, students
can get hands-on experience in
Super 8 and 16 mm. filmmaking,
sound technology, film editing,
directing, cinematography and
screenwriting. Courses in video

“We’ve really been very
fortunate,” says film—studies
Director Lucy Fisher. “Not only
has the program expanded, but I
think Pittsburgh itself has
definitely become more
conscious of cinema as a major
art form in general. With revival
houses like the Pittsburgh
Playhouse, and independent
theaters like the Fulton, people
seem more aware of the different
kinds of films that are being
shown besides the local
Hollywood movies at the
cineplex. People are being
exposed to completely new ways
of appreciating ﬁlm as a cultural

Warhol museum to open z'nPz'ttsburgb

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

Success is a museum in
Pittsburgh.

The Andy Warhol Museum
“will become the most
comprehensive single—artist
museum in America,” according
to Phillip Johnston, director of
The Carnegie Museum of Art.

The museum, slated to open in
Pittsburgh in October 1992, is
currently in the architectural
planning stages, saidjanice Faller,
manager of media relations for
The Carnegie.

Construction on the Volkwein
Building, acquired by The
Carnegie as the site for the
museum, is scheduled to start in
1991. The Volkwein Building will
be a seven-story, 70,400-square-
foot industrial building located
at 117 Sandusky St. on the North
Side.

“We were pleased to discover
the Volkwein Building, where

. the spaces are ideal,“ Johnston

said.

“The whole range of Warhol’s
work can be accommodated in
the planned building, with
paintings, drawings, films, video
and archives all available to the
public,” according to Mark
Francis, curator of contemporary
art for The Carnegie Museum of
Art, who will also serve as director
of the Warhol museum when it
opens.

The museum will house the
permanent collection of more
than 1,000 Warhol works from
the early '50s to the late 805.
Specific works will include
“Campbell Soup Cans” (1962),
“Elvis” (1962-64), “Skulls” (1976)
and “Last Suppers” (1986).

Among other works to be
included in the museum are a
number of commissioned
portraits and self-portraits from
all periods of Warhol’s 30-year
career and the complete collection
of his films.

The museum will house
approximately 1,200 “time

capsules” — boxes ﬁlled with
souvenirs of Warhol’s daily life,
source materials for his paintings,
a full run of Interview magazine,
scripts, audiotapes, scrapbooks
and correspondences.

Permanent, changing and
special exhibitions, which may
include works by other artists,
will be housed at the Warhol
Museum. A museum book store
will offer publications relating to
the artist’s work and life, and will
offer educational tours, lectures
and workshops.

Francis is a curator of
international prominence and the
author of numerous publications
on contemporary art. He has
served as the curator of “Magiciens
de la Terre," a global
contemporary art exhibition
ninning in Paris since 1938. He
completed a master’s degree in
English language and literature at
Oxford University and a
postgraduate diploma in arts
administration at City University

Shimmy—Disc sensations

By Mike Shanley
For The Pitt News

Bongwater — T 00 Much Sleep
B.A.L.L. —— Ball Four (Hardball)

Jellyﬁsh Kiss —— Planle
Various artists —— What Else Do
You Do

If you were to take the newest
Shimmy-Disc records out of their
covers and throw them on the
floor, chances are you wouldn’t
be able to tell them apart just by
looking at them. All Shimmy-
Disc records have the same
design — a body falling through
space in the center — with no
labeling other than side—A and
side-B markings. Shimmy—Disc
founder Kramer (he doesn’t use
his first name anymore) does this
as a budgetary move. It saves
him money. It also forces lazy
radio music directors to listen to
his records.

The records, unlike his labels,
have very little in common most
of the time. In fact, the Shimmy-

Disc roster is one of the most

diverse, if not the most diverse
independent label in
underground music. While a lot
of indies are hooking up with
major labels for distribution,
Kramer still runs it by himself,
releasing a wide variety of strange
and exciting music that can’t be
found anywhere else.

Past Shimmy—Disc releases
include the hilarious poern/songs
of King Missile, the return of ’60s
beat poet Tuli Kupferberg and
reissues of Kramer’s former rock
deconstructionist band
Shockabilly. The only real
similarities Shimmy—Disc albums
have is that Kramer produces and
occasionally plays on them.

Two of the label’s best-known
bands, Bongwater and the now-
defunct B.A.L.L., are Kramer’s
own hands. Bongwater began as
a collaboration with actress/

performance artist Ann
Magnuson. The band was
rounded out by former

Shockabilly drummer David Licht

Ann Magnuson and Kramer's band Bongwater specializes in surreal monologues, mind bending guitars

and classic rock covers.

and later guitarist Dave \Rick.
Earlier releases had outlandish
cover versions of classic rock
(including a version of “Dazed
and Confused” sung in Chinese)
side-by-side with psychedelic
jams, over which Magnuson read
stories dealing with everyday
problems taken to a surreal
extreme.

With Licht gone and Rick in a
more minor role, T 00 Much Sleep
seems to be more the product of
Kramer (bass, keyboards, guitar)
and Magnuson (vocals). While
the new album is more song-
oriented thanthe first two, {he
lyricaloutlook is still the same.
The world they see is frustrating
because“ of the roles we are
assigned by society.

But Bongwater sees these
problems more as something to
parody than anything else. "Talent
Is A Vampire” is a beatbox-driven
rap that begins and ends with
Magnuson doing the voices of
three actress talking about how
the business treats them... “I know
everyone makes fun of my
voices,” one says, “but, like, that’s
OK, ‘cause I’ve got a great body.”

Musically, the band mixes styles
left and right. The title cut is a
beautiful example of how the
band can come up with a trippy
Beatle-ish pop song. “One Hand
On the Road” combines fake
keyboard horns with treated
vocals for an unnerving but
enjoyable effect. Kramer also
makes good use of tape effects to
serve as a bridge between songs
or to add to one’s impact.

Too Much Sleep is a unique,
well—crafted album. There aren’t
many bands today who shovwan
awareness of everyday things and
put this awareness to good use.

B.A.L.L., on the other hand, is a
basic rock assault weapon.
Kramer, vocalist/guitarist Don
Fleming and drummer Jay “The
Rummager” Spiegel play inspired
garage rock that is constantly on
the brink of falling apart but never
does.

The first three B.A.L.L. albums
all contained upwards of 20 songs,
which at times was a bit too
much. Ball Four (Hardball) has
11, which is a better number. Side
1, “Hardball,” was recorded
before the band left for a tour of

Ironically, the five songs are
some of the best material they

Cainey indian circle: Spiritualism in Pittsburgh

By Dmitri Ragano

Sbowcase Editor

In the past decade, many
people have become involved in
new forms of spirituality. The
New Age movement has
introduced mainstream
Americans to a realm of wisdom
beyond Western science and
conventional Christianity. Along
with yoga, Zen and Chinese
philosophies, this includes the
wisdom of Native Americans.
Across North and South America,
traditions and beliefs dating back
to before the first European
conquerors still survive.

Locally, many people have
discovered Native American
wisdom through the Cainey
Indian Spiritual Circle. Miguel
Sague began the circle 10 years
ago. Since that time it has become
one of the most well—known New
the
Pittsburgh area.

Feathers, pottery, arrows and
other Native American artifacts
clutter the small Lawrenceville
home where Sague lives with his
wife and 10-year-old son. For our
interview, Sague and I plop down
on opposite couches. He has just
finished his day job as an art
teacher and is quite tired. I

A native of Cuba, Sague belongs
to the Taino tribe. The Cainey
Circle’s practices derive primarily
from Taino tradition and sacred
Mayan texts such as the Papal Vu.
Like most Native American
traditions, the Cainey Circle holds
a deep reverence for Mother Earth
and the forces of nature.

The Cainey Circle holds full-
moon ceremonies each month.
These include music, dancing and
“sweats” —- a physical and

spiritual puriﬁcation ritual which‘

takes place in the Circle’s sweat
lodge. The Circle’s ceremonies
are held at the American Indian
Center, which is located at the
highest point in Allegheny County
in the North Hills. The Circle also
offers personal advising and
spiritual counseling.

Ethnically, the Circle is diverse:
Sague’s co—1eaders are white
(Spider Cathy Lenhart) and black
(Andrea Poole).

“Our ceremonies are open to
the public," Sague says. “We open
the Circle to non—Indians and
welcome them into Indian
spirituality.”

In the Circle, Sague is a shaman
a holy person who is
considered part mystic, part
healer. Of all the aspects of the
Cainey Circle, Sague says that
shamanic work is “the one people
have the hardest time
understanding and accepting]?

As with yoga and Zen
meditation, the work of a shaman
involves breaking conditioned
habits of perception, emotion and
thought and entering altered states
of consciousness. This can be
done with the aid of hypnotic
drumbeats or the use of
hallucinogenic drugs.

“We can go into trances,” Sague
says, “and gather information.”

Sague was born in Cuba in the
early 1950s. His family came to
America during his childhood. As
an adolescent, he became
interested in religions and studied
to be a shaman both on his own
and under the tutelage of other
shamans. ' .

Sague moved to Pittsburgh after
completing art school in 1977.
Around this time, he began
conceiving a spiritual group.

“The ’70s was a fertile time,”
Sague‘ says.‘ “There was still a lot

Trudy Khsingzon/The Pitt News

of ’60s interest in ecology.” Sague
cites the American Indian
Movement of the early ’70s, which
included incidents at Alcatraz and
Wounded Knee, as an inspiration.
“It was an exciting time for Indian
activism.”

In 1980, Sague founded the
Cainey Circle as a‘ charter member
of the Mother Earth Church in
California. During its first several
years, the Circle received
“guidance and legitimacy” from
the Mother Earth Church.

In 1987, the Cainey Circle
hosted a gathering of 400 people
for the Harmonic Convergence.
It was its biggest gathering ever.
I tell Miguel that, like most people,
I read about the Harmonic

Convergence in Newsweek or saw

Miguel explains that it comes

periods. According to the
calendar, the
Convergence ushered in a five-

year period of purification to be
evidenced in both natural and

of the recorded material by
Shawn D., L.G. and Bubbles,
along with some new material
featuring these performers
and a few others. He also
hopes to have Chill Factor
doing backup on the reggae
part, as well as for a few of
the rappers, instead of relying
on only a D]. to produce the
mix. Live music as part of the
repertoire is what is missing
in a lot of rap acts today,
according to Pearl. “They take
a very easy route sometimes.
Many acts rely on their D]. to
put on all their backup. What
I'd like to see is a band play
something behind an artist
and make it more ﬂexible —-
make it more up to creative
element. It doesn't have to be
anything real slick, just
creative, interesting.”

Anyone interested in the
Soy Sos cassette can find it at
a number of local record
stores, including Collectors
12-inch, Dorsey's and Music
Man, as well as at the Graffiti
show. As for Chill Factor, a
half-live, half—studio release
could be in the works very
soon. Look for Herman Pearl
to be involved with both
projects for some time to
come —-— he seems to think
the two groups can work
together quite nicely. “Both
projects are going hand-in-
hand because the attention
each project gets will help
the other one."

muscles, claiming, “The writing
of Robert ‘China’ Towne brings

0 us back to the time of Raymond

Chandler and Mickey Spillane."

But that's another problem
entirely.

The problem with The Two
jalees is that 16 years after
Chinatown, pulling the elements
of the past enough to pay homage
to the first film gives us a
confusing plot, with characters
coming in and out and no
legitimate explanations as to why
people in the movie do what
they do.

In the movie, 11 years has
elapsed since the death of Evelyn
Mulray, and Jake Gittes
(Nicholson) is still exposing
cheating spouses for a living. He
still draws the line at extortion,
and time has mellowed him.

Real—estate developer Jake
Berman (Harvey Keitel) enlists
Gittes to uncover Berman’s
straying wife, played by Meg
Tilly. The result is murder, and

D._"1 

thus begins our ride through not

only the rarely explained or ‘

developed events of the past, but
also the ramiﬁcations of these
happenings on the events of the
day. '

The cast also includes Madeline
Stowe, Eli Wallach, Ruben Blades,
Frederic Forrest and Richard
Farnsworth. Joe Mantell and Perry
Lopez reprise their roles from the
original movie, and David Keith
stars as the police-officer son of
the cop who killed Evelyn. _,

This particular character }.is
attempting to inﬂict some revenge
on the man ‘who killed Evelyn.
Robert Towne’s script gives us
this, but never mentions what
happened to John Huston’s
character or how he affected the
bastard child whose face Huston
covered in the powerful final
scene of Chinatown.

lt’s understandable if Towne
purposely kept this explanation
out of the script, but to ask all

‘Innocent’ doesn't

do justice

By Rich Turgeon
Staff Writer

Despite the immense popularity
of the book on which this film
was based, not even an ensemble
cast, distinctive cinematography
or a few clumsy sex scenes could
help clearly distinguish this
Harrison Ford vehicle from the
latest cheeseball attempt at
courtroom melodrama of a
made-for-TV “movie of the week. ”

Presumed Innocent is the story

. of a prosecutor trying to clear his

name of his co-worker/rnistress’s
murder. You’ll read reviews of
this ﬁlm that say things like:
“Brilliant, intriguing
captivatingly explores the intricate
system of checks and balances
between corruption, the law and
morality. ...”

Ha! I object. What all this
pretentious pop intellectualizing
ignores is that this is one very
boring and badly directed mess
of a movie. One has a right to
expect more from all the talent
involved here. Alan J. Pakula

heavy-handedness that reduces
most of their expressions to
lengthy scowls and glassy,
“realistic” gazing into space.

Poor Bonnie Bedelia, who was
so good in Heart like a Wheel
and both Die Hards, largely runs
around with messy hair and a
rumpled wardrobe to reﬂect
Pakula’s underscored vision of
an emotionally disarrayed kind
of gal. The usually watchable
Ford is forced to convince us
with a mumbly, gritty, oh—sijo-
serious performance that
epitomizes the appalling lack of
energy and urban texture in this
ﬁlm. ;

I guess the only character we’re
supposed to like is Ford's “Rusty,”
because the women are foolish,
annoying or bitchy, the blacks
are corrupted and the rest of the
white guys are buffoons or just
too dull to mention.

When the half-hour it takes to

Another strange trip

Trying to predict what Tom

Robbins will be writing about
next is like parachuting over
Alabama and telekinetically
preparing }ell—O salad in Iowa:
For a select few it’s easy; the rest
of us just have to wait.
Robbins could trouble even
the most verbose person who
would try to analogize his style.
At times he's like Vonnegut on
acid; at others he’s a demented
little boy reading the
encyclopedias for obscure facts
(like the temperature of a
hummingbird’s anus or how many
uses a beet has).

All is yet another
trip to the bizarre with its Robbins—

Like all of Robbins’ novels, this
book has elements of paganism
in it. About old religions in which
nature was worshipped over man,
Sleinny Legs is his first novel with
a real bite. Going back to the time
when Queen Jezebel ruled,
Robbins explores the downfall of
paganism and the uprising of
Christianity.

and The CollegeHandboole), and
splashing “as seen in Seventeen
magazine” in bright colors across
the back cover couldn’t have
hurt either. Despite the authors’
presumedly best efforts, this
combination guide/ humor book
fails miserably as either.

The authors, Aline Brosh, and
Stacie Lipp, both Harvard
graduates and former writers for
the Crimson and Lampoon,
respectively, have given us
instead a mean-spirited rehash
of the world’s worst cliches, i.e.
types of roommates, types of
boyfriends, college food, ho
hum, ho hum. Let’s face it, if
there is anything to learn from
this book, any student with a
brain in her head could find out
for herself the first week of school
— and not spend a dime.

Oh, and speaking of Lisa
Birnbach, the authors don’t so
much write in her style as
plagiarize her material right down
to pseudo advice columns. In
fact, I’m pretty sure that Birnbach
could sue for copyright
infringement and win. By the
way, nothing in this book is
funny in the least. From chapter
1, the introduction, where Brosh
and Lipp write that they wish
they’d had this book when they
were freshman (sure they do),
throughout the entire book

where they give the most cynical «

campus activities and majors,
the authors spout off the worst
kind of small-minded platitudes,

and it’s boring as hell. Even_

worse, the authors assume that
every co—ed is white, straight
and middle class. I guess
graduating from Harvard does
not necessarily make one more
worldly than we plebeians who
attend public universities — a
myth that these writers dispel
quite nicely.

pretense of responsibility in their

coming to life to face the final
days of our planet.

Robbins digs in with his black
humor about organized religions
in this book, and nothing is sacred.
Remember, Robbins was also the
same man who brought Pan, the
goat god, to life in his best-selling
jitterbug Perfume.

There are televangelists with
bad acne and a keen sexual
attraction. There are Arabs and
Jews and Salome dancing with
her veils. This is Robbins with an

__ edge.

His style is amazingly fresh
with each new addition to his list
of books. Robbins first seared
into America ’s consciousness with
Another Roadside Attraction, a
story with an entourage of
gypsies, magicians and hippies
who manage to get into the
Vatican vaults and ﬁndjesus Christ

(and funny, didn’t he look
Jewish?).
His other books have

approached such topics as lesbian
cowgirls, the magical qualities of
being a redhead and immortality
through daily sexual practices.

His latest book Sleinny Legs
and All beautifully complements
his other tragically weird novels
and will provide the reader with
evenings of freaky enjoyment.

Robbins is one of the most
talented writers publishing today.
With his delicious prose and
yummy plots, I’d love to eat him
alive.

treatment of more serious topics,
like alcohol and drug use, but
their “advice” reeks of hypocrisy
when inserted as a small
paragraph between pages
instructing them to do the
opposite of what they advise.
After a chapter detailing various
types of drinking games, alcoholic
recipes and different ways to
party, there is a paragraph arguing
that drug use is “the worst kind
of retro—sixties tacky, the chemical
equivalents of love beads and tie
dye.” I wonder if they honestly
think that women are not going
to snort a line because someone
once said that it’s a violation of
fashion laws. Besides, drugs never
really went out of style, they just
evolved into more potent
variations. Instead of this phony
proselytizing, why don’t they just
say that drug use is illegal, and so
is underage drinking?

The authors do give one useful

bit of advice that I’ll pass along: If
you find yourself unexpectedly
pregnant, get a copy of (The
New) Our Bodies, Ourselves,

which will provide you with
detailed and accurate information
about your options. Here's one

more piece of advice from the

reviewer: Don't buy A Coed’s
Companion; EverythingA Smart
Woman Needs to Know About

get your hands on (me New) Our

better than the other; it depends

to enter into an arts situation,
whether it be graduate school or
going on to get more specific
training.”

The non—intensive nature of
Pitt's program leaves a lot up to
the students. “The student makes

it what the student wants it to
be,” says Welland.

Ralke, a senior, says thatunlike
an art-school situation, “we’re
not just stamped out ——~— ‘well,
you can tell this person’s from
this school because they all use
this technique’ — it allows for
more individuality. We get a lot
of attention instead of being
another number.”

teaching faculty. In particular,
senior Janet Jarczynka praises
Professor Paul Glabicki, who is
also an internationally known
painter and ﬁlmmaker. “He gives
you so many ideas in so little
time.”

“The teachers stay active. Seeing
what the teachers are doing is
incentive,” saysJarczynka. “When
you see what they’re doing, it
makes you not want to turn in
junk.”

Teaching is also a very popular
career choice among students. “It
is important for me to stay in a
learning environment,” says
Ralke, who plans to go to graduate
school and eventually teach at
the college level.

" Students get a chance to show
their work at an end—of-the-
school-year show held at the

University of Pittsburgh Gallery
at\Forbes Avenue and Bouquet
Street. Students may also try to
show their work independently,
primarily in group or juried shows
around the city. This is uncommon
since at the undergraduate level
most people are still developing
their work.

When declaring studio arts as a
major, a student must submit his
or her work for evaluation by
faculty. Some find the
department’s non—selectivity
troubling. “Unless you have
nothing, they’ll letyou continue,”
says Jarczynka. “No one gets
weeded out, and there are a lot of
weeds taking up space and
material.”

Weiland cites lack, of student
interest as “one thing that’s a
struggle. But ifyou find a serious

student and build enthusiasm
around that serious student, I
think other people will follow. I
think someone has to get the ball
rolling.’’

To get the ball rolling, Weiland,
Ralke and several other students
recently founded an art club. The
art club hopes to gather faculty
and local artists for lectures and
rou nd—table discussions. Another
objective is setting up an
independently organized student
show.

“I hope the club can serve as a
meeting ground for various ideas, ”
says Ralke, “an exchange between
[students in] fine arts, studio arts,
photography and film studies.”

“We want to get a little bit of
notice,” says Weiland, “stir up
some excitement. I definitely think
the talent is there.”

Honorable mention goes to the

tells what listening to rock ‘n’ roll

The songs on W72atELseDo You

humor, unfair treatment of women
and the environment, and love or
lack thereof. And while there is
deﬁnitely a folk feel to the album,
that feel and any message the

goes further than it should. In
other words, you don’t have to be
a fan of folk or protest music to
enjoy this album.

Maxi Priest ‘
Bonafide
Charisma

In 1988 Maxi Priest ﬂirted with
Top 40 success with his cover of
Jimmy Cliffs “Wild World.” Priest
picks up where he left off with his
new releaseB0naﬁde. Priest’s new
LP, on the expanded Virgin record
label Charisma, includes an all-
star lineup of reggae musicians
Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare
and Handel Tucker. Priest also
manages to break the ties of
traditional reggae, straying away
from the likes of Peter Tosh and
Bob Marley, making Bonaﬁde a
crossover contender.

A combination of reggae and
urban sounds can be heard on

' this LP. Bonafide opens with “Just

a Little Bit Longer,” a nifty number
that brings out Priest’s vocal
capabilities. This first song slides

right into “Close To You,” the
emphasized track on the album,

with an interesting string

arrangement by the Reggae

Philharmonic Orchestra. This song

also has some similarities to Soul
II Soul’s material.

Bonafide really picks up on its
second side. Strong songwriting
is shown in “Temptress,” a song
about the temptations of a
fabulous woman. One of the most
interesting songs is “Peace
Throughout the World.” This is
produced by and features Jezzy
B. of Soul II Soul. “Peace” shows
Priest’s range of musical capability.
Along with the soft vocals are a
pumping drum beat andjezzy B.’s
typical Soul II Soul monologue.
Bonafide also features “Sure Fire
Love" and “Life,” and closes with
a sensitive number, “Prayer for
the World. ”

Priest’s second release does not
hold the traditional reggae sound,
and at some points seems to be
watered down. It still is a fun
album. Many artists have poor
showings with their second
release, but Priest shows no
sophomore jinx and seems to be
developing into a real talent.

Sonic Youth

Hype, hype, hype. Little doubt
by now that even if you’ve never
heard the band, the name Sonic
Youth registers somewhere
amidst countless others fed to
you by commercial radio, MTV
and major record labels. Such is
the advantage of extensive
promotion for a band. Only a
major label has the resources to
promote extensively.

Unfortunately, aggressive
promotion is all too frequently
wasted on safe, mundane and
otherwise talentless “artists” who
are guaranteed to make a profit

an average teenage moviegoer.

“When I ﬁrst got to school,”
explains Como, “I had never seen
D.W. Griffith, Bergman,
Eisenstein or Rossellini. I had
never been exposed to these ﬁlms
when I grew up. Looking back, I
wish I had. They’re much more
socially conscious than American
movies.

Aside from all the great
ediﬁcation one can get from the
film program, what exactly does
one do with a ﬁlm degree?

“I think many of the graduates
will eventually go into
production,” says Fisher. “I hope
that there continues to be a
demand for young talent,
especially with the city becoming
more and more of a production
center for on—location Hollywood
ﬁlmmaking. Many of our students
have gotten internships or jobs
working on movies that were
shot in Pittsburgh.”

Indeed, the city has become a
haven for independent and
Hollywood producers seeking a
refuge from the exorbitant
location fees charged by most
American cities. Pittsburgh offers
an enticing alternative. With an
area that offers a wide range of
topography and landscapes,
Pittsburgh has been the site of
such blockbusters as The Deer‘

Hunter, Flasbdance, Night of the
Living Dead and the pilot for the
recent successful television series
“Equal Justice. ”

Last March, Jonathan Demme
completed shooting his suspense
thriller The Silence of the Lambs,
starring Jodie Foster, Anthony
Hopkins and Scott Glenn. The
film, scheduled for a winter
release, utilized almost every
available location in Pittsburgh,
from the inner— city
neighborhoods of the Golden
Triangle to the outskirts of Forest
Hills. Locations in and around
the Pittsburgh area were used to
portray several American cities
like Memphis, Calamut City, 111.,
and even Washington, D.C.

March also saw the creation of
the Pittsburgh Film Ofﬁce, an
organization that assists
Pittsburghers and Hollywooders
in the production of ﬁlms. Headed
by Robert M. Curran, the Film
Office will certainly become an
invaluable place for ﬁlm students
to learn of upcoming ﬁlms being
shot in Pittsburgh and Western
Pennsylvania.

While the Big Four film schools
— USC, UCLA, Columbia and
NYU —— are churning out ﬁlm
graduates who aspire to directing
careers and whose student ﬁlms
are readily seen by industry
experts, Pitt promises an even
more difficult struggle for ﬁlm
graduates seeking the fame and
glory of a prestigious Hollywood
career. At USC, producers are
known to make mob scenes to
get ﬁrst crack at screening the
new student films.

At Pitt, this is hardly
commonplace, and Pitt’s ﬁlm
graduates have to compete with
these advantaged ﬁlm students
from the Big Four schools.

“I’ve made six films in my
college career,” says Francis “Rico”

Gagliano, a senior. “And I'm not
going to have any of them seen
in the job-placement
opportunities that New York or
California provides. Not in the

» least bit. They’re not all great. I

mean, I understand that, and I’ve
grasped that reality. But my own
ambitions are there.

“I would like very much to go
to grad school at one of the Big
Four, though. I’ve been lucky to
work on a couple of movies shot
in Pittsburgh, and I’ve met some

L, good contacts. But if I’m going to

make it in the industry as a
director or writer, I’m going to
have to do it on my own. You
can’t become a director by being
a grip for the rest of your life.
You have to be a maverick.”

“I think I've gotten some pretty
good technical background,” says
Como of Pittsburgh Filmmakers.
“The equipment isn’t the greatest
in the world, but it’s very
inexpensive for the average
student, compared to what they'd
be paying if they were at a big
school. It does get considerably
expensive once you get into the
higher-level courses, like
Filmmaking III and IV. You know,
by that point, you had better be
prepared to spend quite a few
hundred dollars, maybe even a
thousand. It’s tough, but
instructors realize that you’re
serious about your work, so they’ll
push you hard tozget done.”

And what about those big
schools? Neither Temple
University nor Penn State is a big
school like USC or NYU, but they
have their very own media-arts
departments and their own
production facilities for radio,
television and film. Point Park
College and even Duquesne
University have similar studio
access as well. Pitt is a big school,
with hundreds of millions of
dollars, yet there is no media-arts
department or on-campus
facilities. If Pitt doesn’t have
anything in terms of production,
besides its fortunate connection

with Filmmakers, what kind of
productive education can one
expect to get?

“It is curious why there are no
campus facilities or departments,”
says Mark Best, a senior in the
program. “ Isuppose the powers-
that-be realize that many students
can get the same thing at Point
Park or CMU down the street.
(Pitt's) priorities are in health and
engineering areas, and they’re
well—justiﬁed in concentrating on
those areas of academic growth.
There are more important jobs in
the world besides making movies,
you know.”

Compared to Sonic Youth’s

undoubtedly the safest, and
therefore likely to be the most

sellout. Goo successfully

WPTS dl ‘”°“'e

By Jessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

Ultimately responsible for
hundreds of records, the training
of potential D.j.s and getting
the hottest new sound out to
Pittsburgh’s radio audience, Rob
Penman seems at ease with all
his responsibilities.

“I feel like a curator of a
museum; I’ve been able to
preserve and protect all of this
recorded music,” says WPTS
station manager Penman. “The
most valuable thing I will carry
from my experience here is the
music.”

WPTS 98. S is the University of
Pittsburgh’s radio station that
has been spinning alternative
tunes for six years as an FM
station. Previously it was known
as WPGH, which was started by
Adrian Cronauer in 1957. (He
was portrayed by Robin
Williams in Good Morning
Vietnam.)

Following in these lofty
footsteps hasn’t swayed
Penman, who regards WPTS as
one of the best organizations at
Pitt. “We are a student group;
however, we don’t have secret
handshakes or pour beer down
each other’s throats. There is a
great network of friends [at the

stationl.”

Music as a whole, without
singling out one genre or era, is
important to Penman. “Music
is the main part of our spirit. It
inspires and is cathartic. Music
reflects the whole scope of
human emotions, and that is a
great thing.”

Penman grew up with the
Beatles and The Who as well as
his parents’ music, which
included classical and jazz
music. He remembers listening
to WRCT at Carnegie Mellon
University where he first heard
the Sex Pistols, Fear, Husker
Du and Black Flag. But
Penman’s real know-how of
music came “when I got to
WPTS. You can learn so much
from our archives,” he said.

As for top 40, which may be
on the other end of a college
radio’s playlist, Penman believes
that “top 40 in the '70s and early
’80s was a more honest
reﬂection of popular culture.
Top 40 today has sold out to
corporate moguls like Pepsi,
Coke and Miller Light. WPTS is
an alternative because we aren’t
the darlings of corporate
America."

Penman regards the recent
issue of censorship as
abhorable. “The media is now

WPTS Station Manager Rob Pemnan.

going on morality witch—hunts.
It started with the war on drugs,
and now it’s not just a war on
chemicals; it’s a war on ideas.”

Penman says that parents have
the responsibility of deciding
what music their children should
listen to. “It’s up to the parents
to decide what children should
and should not listen to  In
our free and egalitarian society
we should be able to tolerate
everything.”

Penman says the freedom
found on college radio is
wonderful, but he is in fear of its

future. “It scares me that more
and more major recording labels
have found college radio as a
way to test bands.] College radio
is where we can explore and
decide what we want to play
and not be pressured by certain
record representatives who call
———and they do call WPTS.”

Penman, a senior in English
literature, has a “wait-and-see
attitude” about his future. As far
as landing any jobs in the music
biz, Penman says, “The only
way to remain in music is by
making it.”

ElLswortbAz2enue.- Anything on
this street is hip. Including the
beautiful lawns that were mowed
by our Managing Editor, Tim
Azinger.

Frz'end’s ’Meeting House.-
Vegetarian society, Humanists,
NOW’s Neanderthal Awards,
new—age bands, dream-analysis
seminars, coffee houses and
Native American long dances are
just a few of the events this place
holds. Another hip place on
Ellsworth Avenue. The house
itself is gorgeous.

This is by no means a totally
comprehensive list of tragically
cool places to hang, but this
should give you a good start in
finding even more hideaways and
off-the-beaten-path places to be
the hippest and most happening

Thank you once again for your cooperation
in proving that “landlord” need not be a
four letter word...

If both the landlord and tenants are “straight” with
each other, then quality apartments and furniture can
be provided at a fair rental. Our tenants have
consistently upheld their provisions Of the lease,
hopefully because we've been so fair, considerate and
responsive to them. Consequently, once again there
are no vacancies until September 1990; please let us
hear from you in February, when we quickly rent for
the next fall term.

PUBLIC INTEREST
COMMUNICATIONS,
INC.

Open Letter

Dear Friends,
When I started school two years ago,
I found that I needed a part time job to
make that extra cash for books, parties,
etc., you know. Well, a friend told me
about PUBLIC INTEREST
COMMUNICATIONS, so I thought I'd
try it. You see, they have really ﬂexible
hours; I could work it around my school
schedule. And they offer great vacation
pay and medical benefits for people
who maintain 22 1/2 hours per week.
The people are so interesting. In
addition to students, there are parents
and professionals who are all here for
different reasons. I really enjoy talking
to so many involved ple. Like
hearing first hand what it is really like
in Africa from a retired state
department ofﬁcial, while we are
working on a compaign to reduce the
suffering from a prolonged African
drought. We've worked for all the major
environmental organizations; on ozone,
acid rain, and the rain forest. Right now,
we're working on the assault rifle issue,
accountability in Congress, and
apartheid, to name a few. There's
more... I'd like you to call 622-7370 after
1pm for an interview. We're located in
North Oakland, near the busline. I'll
write again.
Sincerely,
Ken W.
