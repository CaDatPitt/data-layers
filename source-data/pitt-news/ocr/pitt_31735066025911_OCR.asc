Course evaluation guide planned for students

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

Student Government Board’s
Academic Affairs Committee is plan-
ning to work on a course evaluation
guide and wants to help students who
are afraid to complain to their profes-
sors next semester. ‘

Committee Chairperson Lynn
Sucevic said that she is very optimistic
about these upcoming projects.

She said that the academic issues of
students exist, and it is up to the com-
mittee to do something about them.‘

“No one at this university is going" to

do anything, unless you are heard,”

she said.

The committee will be looking into
a course evaluation guide that
would rate both the course and
instructor.

Guides from Syracuse University,
University of Virginia and University
of Michigan were shown as examples
at last night’s meeting. 8

“All big universities do it,” she said.
“If they can do it, I think we could do
it here.”

Nothing concrete is beyond the
planning stage.

The surveys that students are asked
to take in classes also need to be clar-
ified, she said. Some of the questions
do not make any sense and have no
use for the students.

Sucevic said, “I want to come up
with questions we would like to see
all professors asked.”

She said that all plans for the guide
will definitely be determined by the
end of January.

Another idea that the committee will
be working on is becoming an inter-
mediary between students with com-
plaints and their professors.

According to Sucevic, some students
are afraid to talk to the professors
fearing that the professor will hold a
grudge or not be fair in grading.

To solve this problem, Sucevic said
that maybe a complaint log book
could be placed in the 8GB office so
students can come and write‘ down

their complaints.

Then the committee could go to the
professor or department with the com-
plaints, while also keeping the stu-
dents’ identity hidden.

She said that perhaps they could
send a letter to each department
telling them of the committee’s plans,
so they will be aware of what is hap-
pening.

Sucevic said that so far 12 people
have signed up for the committee, but
she is still trying to recruit more mem-
bers.

“If enough people work, in the long
term [the Academic Affairs Committee]
could be a very strong committee in
SGB,” she said.

Your books com be
soldfor more money

By Holly Affeltranger
Stajf Writer

Are you sick of paying outra-
geous prices for books? Are you
alsosick of selling them back
and receiving less than half of
what you originally paid for
them? There is now an alterna-
tive.

The College of General Studies

H Student Government, the College

of Arts and Sciences Student
Government Board and the
Graduate and Professional
Student Association are sponsor-
ing a referral service for students
that will eliminate the middle
man.

The University Book Exchange
Referral Service (U.B.E.R.S.) will
be a free service that will help
students sell their books directly
to other students.

Craig Williams, CGS council
member, organized this project
and feels that it is a great oppor-
tunity for students to save money
when buying and selling their
books.

“This program is easy to use.
It’s practical and free to the stu-

dents,” Williams said.

Student Government Board
President Gil Golden said that
this is the best alternative to high
book costs.

The U.B.E.R.S. program will
refer students selling their books
to students who want to buy the
books. This way they both can
find a reasonable price for the
books and feel they have saved
money. 9

The seller needs to fill out a
registration form that is in the
November issue of the Night
Times, the CGS newspaper, or in
the CGS Student Government
office, which is located at room
615 in the William Pitt Union.

Buyers need to call the
U.B.E.R.S. phone line at 648-7899
to see if the book they are inter-
ested in is available.

“It’s a good program for all stu-
dents to save money. So why not
use it?” Williains said.

The service will be scheduled
from Monday, Nov. 30 to Friday,
Dec. 18. It will resume after
semester break on Wednesday,
Jan. 6 and continue to Tuesday,
Jan. 19. CGS Student

Clapp Hall explosion
scare a false alarm

Byjohn Temple
Sta_ﬁ'Writer

Mondays nitroglyceiine scare in Clapp Hall turned out to be a false
alarm, Pitt’s Public Safety Department said.

City police tested the container of what was suspected to be nitro-
glycerine by setting off an explosive charge near the container, but the
size of the explosion indicated that the contents were not dangerous,
according to Assistant Director of Public Safety Gary Moses.

Bomb squad officials removed the container from a biology laborato-
ry refrigerator in Clapp Hall Monday morning after Facilities
Management reported that it may have been nitroglycerine. A lab work-
er had remembered a week earlier that a now—deceased professor had
told her five years ago that it had contained nitroglycerine.

The container may have held highly diluted nitroglycerine made from
dissolved heart pills, laboratory coordinator Rosemary Boone said. The
professor may have been using this substance in experiments involving

blood ﬂow in small organisms.

2 TI-IE PIITNEWS, Thursday, November ~19; 1992
Got the ﬂu? Here are some Ways to ﬁght it

nﬂuenm (or ﬂu) is a contagious viral

infection of the respiratory system. It

can strike any age group but usually is

more severe in the elderly, young chil-
dren and persons with chronic respiratory
problems. Most people are ill for only a few
days, but some persons may have a more
serious illness and may need to be hospital-
ized. Unfortunately, many people die each
year in the United States from ﬂu or related
complications. The ﬂu usually occurs. in the
United States from November to April.

The onset of inﬂuenza may occur sudden-
ly. The symptoms include fever (can be quite
high), headache (can be severe), muscle
aches and pains (especially low back and eye
muscles). A person may also have chills, a
runny nose, stuffy or congested ears, cough
and weakness.

There is no magical cure for the ﬂu. It is a
viral infection and does not respond to treat-

‘ ment with penicillin or other antibiotics. The

only “cure” is an' individual’s own immune
system. The immune system can be aided
with a lot of rest and plenty of ﬂuids (at least
10-12 glasses of liquid daily). There is tempo-
rary relief for some of the symptoms:

-Tylenol (2 tablets every four hours) may
be used to relieve aches and pains as well as
reduce fever. ‘

°Gargling warm salt water (1 teaspoon of
salt mixed into 8 oz of warm water) every

three or four hours may make your throat
feel better.

°Decongestants can help with the discom-
fort of congestion and a runny nose, but they
often have adverse side effects such as ner-
vousness. .

-Coughing serves a useful purpose. If
there is something in your lungs, or if there is

 

drainage in your throat, a cough will help
remove it. Inhaling steam (vaporizer) will
help break up mucous. If you wish to use a
medication, choose an expectorant for a pro-
ductive cough (expelling mucous and
phlegm). For a non-productive cough (not
bringing anything up), use a cough suppres-
sant or antitussives.

-If you smoke — don’t.

-Never mix medication and alcoholic bev-
erages. I

It can also be dangerous to take different
medications together. If in doubt about any

medication you should call your physician, or
call Student Health Pharmacy at 648-1256.
Persons with ﬂu symptoms should see a
health care provider if they have asthma,
chronic bronchitis or a history of rheumatic
fever, rheumatic heart disease or pneumonia.
They should also see a health provider if they
experience a fever of 101 degrees or above
for longer than two or three days, have had
coughing spells, cough up thick, greenish-

yellow or bloody sputum, have ear aches, 9

severe headaches or facial pain.

The viruses that cause ﬂu change frequent-
ly, so people who in previous years have had
inﬂuenza or a ﬂu shot may not be immune.
Each year the Center for Disease Control in
Atlanta, Ga., determines what strain is likely
to occur in the United States and requests
vaccines to be /made against those strains:
A/Texas, A/Beijing and B/Panama. The vac-
cine will begin to provide protection after
one to two weeks. Because inﬂuenza is usu-
ally not life threatening in otherwise healthy
individuals and most people do fully recover,
health officials emphasize the use of the vac-
cine for the elderly and people with other
health problems. Students who have chronic
upper respiratory problems or immunological
disorders should see a Student Health Service
physician to get a prescription for a ﬂu shot,
and the Allegheny County Health Department
will then give the shot free of charge.

By Catherine Goldstein
Staﬁ’ Writer

At a recent gay and lesbian
conference, there was a work-
shop dealing with the issue of
biphobia.

Those who attended were dis-
cussing why people were
uncomfortable with biphobia,
when a man stood up and said
he felt bisexuals were untrust-
worthy and that they were like
fence-sitters; and if society
became extremely homophobic
they would go back into the dos-
et and pretend to be heterosexu-
al.

Todd Kinavey, former co-presi-
dent of the Bisexual, Gay and
Lesbian Alliance, said he consid-
ers himself bisexual and that he
was really offended by this state-
ment.

“I’ve been out with a group of
people, and they’ve said deroga-
tory things and made jokes about
bis,” Kinavey said.

Bisexual rights and biphobia
are becoming major issues in the

gay community and across the
country. Loraine Hutchins, a
national bisexual activist, told
University of Pittsburgh students
last month that the bisexual
movement is gaining strength in
the United States.

Hutchins, the co—editor of Bi
Any Other Name: Bisexual people
speak out, said in an Oct. 12 arti-
cle in Ybe Pitt News, “One of the
most exciting things happening
to me is to see gay student
groups  including bisexuals, not
only in the titles of the groups
but also in [their] Programming
and leadership,” Hutchins said.

According to the Kinsey
Report, which examined sexuali-
ty in the United States in the
19405, roughly 40 percent of the
population of the United States is
bisexual. There have been no
major studies on sexuality in
recent years.

It has been only recently that
bisexuals were considered in the
sexuality equation. The gay rights
movement has often left out the
bisexual community.

“Both straight and gay people
exhibit biphobia, and so do
bisexuals  For heterosexuals,
biphobia is often part of their
homophobia,” Hutchins said.

Biphobia does not necessarily
mean a fear of bisexual people.
However, there are certain feel-
ings of animosity toward those
individuals who identify them-
selves as bisexual.

“People in the gay community
aren’t comfortable with bisexuals.
They think it’s a stage they are
going through or that they are
untrustworthy. It’s like sleeping
with the enemy, literally,”
Kinavey said.

He continued to say that there
are feelings of betrayal on the
part of gay members. He said
that it is tougher on bisexual
women who break up with their
partners than for a straight ‘man,
because in our society women
have been oppressed for so long
by men, and then they turn
around to be with the oppressor.

Cafeteria, living conditions to be addressed

By Elizabeth Petras

' For The Pitt News

Ricture this: A peaceful uni-

I versity forum consisting of top

administrators and undergrad-'
uate students withno signs of
screaming, yelling, uproar or
protest. .

— Believe it or not, this actual-
lyre happened at the recent
Resident Student Association
(RSA) forum on Nov. 2.

Students and administrators
were able to openly express
their problems, their concerns
and even their approval of

each other’s actions. A second
forum is scheduled for
Monday, Dec. 7, at 8:30 -p.m.

“We wanted to do one big
thing at the university _— to
establish a link between the
university and administration,”
RSA President Dina
Scardamalia said. “We decided
this way was the easiest, best
and most positive."

Denine
assistant director of Resident
Life, agreed. .“It was the
chance for the students to
voice their opinions, and that
was evident in the turnout,”

Rocco-Minteer, ‘

she said.

Scardamalia said she hopes
student interest will continue
for future forums. As well as
changing topics throughout

for each forum according to

the specific area being dis-'

cussed.

Upcoming topics include
cafeteria food, the mainte-7

nance department, living con-
ditions and policies such as
the present overnight policy
and smoking regulations.
Scardamalia said she hopes

these topics spark as much
interest from the student body
as the first forum did.

“It's a chance for the admin-

j-yistration to see students aren’t
the year, the selected adminis- ,
trative panel will also rotate

apatheticand want tonmake a

change,” she said.

Scardamalia said the first
forum was. lwel-l-represented

,by the students despite a lack
of advertising.

She and’ her committee
members are planning on

pared to the last forum.

Pitt sophomore Link

tablevto browse at the

He said that although he
does not like testing on
animals he does not mind
eating them.

Rob Neff, another stu-

dent, stopped and said,
“Are you guys serious?
What’s wrong with eating
food?” .

An argument followed.

Neff continued with the
question “What’s the diﬂ°er-
_ ence between killing a veg-
-  '~ , etable and killing a turkey?”

Grant argued back that
vegetables are not kept in
cages and forced to live in
their own waste.

But Neff could not be
convinced. “I see nothing
wrong with eating turkey. I
wish they’d [farmers] be
nicer to them, but I’m still

‘ going to eat them.”

Enough is enough

“Any religious person knows that it is a sin to be dis-

respectful of another’s religion. For us, religion and cul- '

ture are not so separate. On this mountain is a great
life-giving force. You have no knowledge of the place
you are about to destroy.”

These words were spoken by Franklin Stanley Sr., a
San Carlos Apache medicine man and spiritual leader to
those groups, including Pitt, which plan to expand two
observatories on a sacred Apache mountain. We hope
these words reach the office of Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor, who has the final say in Pitt’s $15 million
stake in the proposed Mt. Graham Observatory.

This site was chosenfor two reasons: its ideal atmos-
pheric conditions and its cost efficiency. But for the
Apache Native Americans there no price can be placed
on a mountain which, to them, is a “life-giving force.”

Cyril Hazard, an astronomy and physics professor,
said that if Pitt chooses to take part in the funding of
this project it will “earn Pitt some prominence.”
Prominence in what? A

Prominence in science, yes. But also prominent for
being known as a university, supposedly dedicated to
higher learning, yet unwilling to respect what is sacred
to another culture. We think the $15 million could be
better used for a “cultural observatory” here at Pitt. The
need to explore and understand this world’s culture and
diverse people is more valuable to the university com-
munity than gazing at the stars.

While the culture of these‘ peoples must be explored"

and understood, it is quite evident that this institution
‘of higher learning doesn’t understand that the sanctity
of these indigenous peoples wishes should be adhered
to. For centuries, American Indians have been pushed

_aside m the name of progress. They have continuously

heard the same argument being shoveled to_ them by
Dr. Turnschek of the physics and astronomy depart-
ment, that “this observatory would provide good jobs
for a lot of the Apaches.” Well, how many Native
Americans work in New York City? In the other areas
where they have been exploited? ,

The answers to these questions can be found in the
idea that it is OK for the “mainstream” cultural groups to

' manipulate and destroy other cultures. Well, imagine if

the telescope was to be placed upon the Holy Temple
in Jerusalem or on the top of St. Paul’s Basilica in Rome.
Were these sanctimonious grounds “ideal” locations for
the telescope an alternative would surely be found.

We understand the importance of this project and how
difficult it would be to find another location. But to step
on a group that has been stepped on more times than
any other facet’ of society is wrong. We ask the universi-
ty administration to either scrap the project altogether or
take a stand and consider an alternative location ——
even if it costs a little more money.

On Nov. 3, 1992, America elect-
ed Arkansas native William
_Ieﬂ°erson Clinton to the presidency
of the United States. His election to
the highest oﬁice in the land was
the culmination of 20 years of
political ambition and political bat-
tles. On Jan. 20, 1993, he also will

geal.- _
Arkansas has had other power-
ful politicos before. After all,
Democratic Senator J. William
Fulbright,’ Clinton’s political men-

tor, was the chairman of the Senate

Foreign Relations Co_mmittee dur-
ing the ‘60s and early 703, before
his surprising defeat in a 1974 pri-
mary battle with an up-and-com-
ing Dale Burners. Rep. Wilbur Mills

House Ways and Means
Committee during the Johnson and
Nixon administrations‘, before his
fall from grace in the Tidal Basin

ticket. In 1928, Senator Joe, T.

know how people feel about “out—
siders.” Such a feeling still perme-
ates certain areas of the state, so
some citizens were a bit irritated
with Clinton’s presidential aspira-
tions, regardless of political ideolo-
gy. This was because his campaign

brought so much media attention A

to the state. Its not that we have
anything to hide, we just want to

keep you eastern establishment‘

people out of our hair, as the feel-
ing goes. Happily, this feeling was
held only by a small handful of
people. The rest of us were.more
than happy to welcome the cam-
eras so we could show off our
state and welcome the business,
because we could use the money.

The best thing about the campaign
and the attention is that it has final-
ly replaced the images of 1957. (If
you do not know to what I refer,
I’ll never tell. Go look it up, if you
must.) As governor for 12 of the
past 14 yeirs, Clinton has worked

very hard at trying to improve

Arkansas’ image. “Bill Clinton has
given the state a lot of confidence,”
Cal Ledbetter, one of Arkansas’
most respected political scientists
and historians, said, “The feeling is
‘Hey someone from Arkansas can
be president!” We’ve had a num-
ber of Hollywood types (Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason) and sports
ﬁgures (Barry Foster, y’all know

him?) come from the state, ‘but ..

never a president

If Arkansas can (or will) take
advantage of Bill Clinton’s presi-
dency the way Georgia did of
Jimmy Carter’s, we’ll do all right A
tarnished image is hard to over-
come, but Clinton is doing what
he can to change that. And, hey,
look what Lee Iacocca did for
Chrysler. Even our image "wasn't
that bad.

Gates had no business debating law

Asking former LA. Police Chief
Daryl Gates to debate on “Law and
Order” makes as much sense" as
asking Hitler to participate in a
human rights discussion.

Perhaps the P.P.C. should be
more considerate. To use student
funds to invite a blatantly racist
individual to discuss such‘ an
important topic as law and order is
not only insulting, but tasteless.
The members of the PPC wanted
controversy, and they got it I can
only hope that students who paid

for this mockery will raise their

voices to prevent it from happen-
ing again.

I’ve been  interest

the commentary surrounding the
Gates/Strossen debate last week.
In Monday’s Pitt News Mr. Ricci
made the comment that “a repre-

 

sentative from the ACLU” was
debating Gates. Excuse me,
Nadine Strossen is the Prmident of
the ACLU. She is, in fact, the first
female president of this large orga-
nization. I ﬁnd it fascinating that in
the frenzy surrounding Gatw, this
incredibly, articulate and successful
woman was ignored Reading the
two articles concerning the debates
in 7hePittNews I found it rather
diﬂicult to even locate her name

and only noticed one "quote taken

from her. Instead, the moron got

his name all over the front page.
When I first heard about the
debates, I thought it was hilarious
that Gates was debating Ms.
Strossen. I pictured her making an
even bigger fool out of him within
the ﬁrst five minutes, and the audi-
ence getting a good laugh. I am
not disagreeing with the tactics-of
the BAS, nor am I at all pleased
with the PPC for bringing Gates
here. I am angry, however, at the
lack of respect given to Strossen,
both by The Pitt News and by the
many others who brushed her off
as a mere accessory in the dime of

Gates’ appearance.

Pitt/ Penn State among
classic football rivalries

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

When big college football
rivalries are the subject,
Michigan/Ohio State,
USC/UCLA, Miami"/Florida
State and Alabama/Auburn
quickly come to mind.

Pitt fans may not rank
Pitt/Penn State ‘as a rivalry
of national interest due to
the disappointing season the
Panthers are having and the
mediocre season the Lions
are having. But Pitt/Penn
State is still right up there
with the rest of the all-time
classic football rivalries.

The key to this historical
matchup is not the fact that
neither team is vying for a
national championship. Each
team’s records should not
even be considered when
analyzing the importance of
this game. This is one of the
longest-standing college
football rivalries in the his-
tory of the game. _

game took place in 1895
when Penn State won 32-0.

“all'that” all year, the quarter-
back position has provided
head coach Joe Paterno with
plenty of headaches.

By means of either injuries or

"poor play, Penn State has shuf-

ﬂed four different QBs in its 10
games to date: John Sacca,
Wally Richardson, Kerry Collins
and Matt Nardolillo. Collins is
the current play-caller -— with
Sacca out with an injury.

“The quarterback issue is
obviouslyjthe major issue for
them,” Hackett said. “When you
play three or four different peo-

ple in the course of the year, it
- makes it hard.” ‘

Hackett added that he was

impressed with Collins’ play in
the past few weeks — especial-
ly last week.

“I thought he played well [last
week against Notre Dame] ——
maybe his best ballgame,”
Hackett said. “He was able to
establish rhythm and run the
football team the way that
Coach Paterno [wantedl.”

Helping Collins with his
rhythm are the Nittany Lions’
other top—skilled offensive play-
ers, including senior tight end

yards and a touchdown), full-
back Brian O’Neil (67 carries for

yards).

On the other side of the line
of scrimmage, Penn State’s
defense is led by linebackers
Phil Yeboah-Kodie (57 tackles)
and Reggie Givens (55 tackles).
Paterno said he has been
impressed with Givens’ play all
season.

“Reggie had a really big game
against Notre Dame, with some-
thing like 16_ tackles,” Paterno
said. “He’s just an outstanding
outside linebacker.”

every week of this season.

“My stats have dropped this
year from what they were last
year,” Williams said. “In the
beginning of the year I didn’t
play as well as I would have
liked to because of my weight
and some personal problems in
my life. But in the last couple
of weeks, and especially last
week, the defense has gotten
better. A

“We only gave up 250 yards
last week against Louisville,
and that is the best game that
we played as a ‘defense this
year. Personally  I’m playing
better, I’m lighter, I’m-flying
around and hitting people, and
I’m having fun.”

Williams is leading the team
in tackles with 62 and works
despite the lack of awards.

“I am not into awards and
things of that nature,” Williams
said. “I am just here to play
football for the University of
Pittsburgh; and whatever hap-
pens, well then it just hap-
pens.” '

Williams said he felt the loss
of inside linebacker Tom
Tumulty and some other key
defensive players.

“Tommy [Tumulty] is a great
ballplayer, and we work well
with each other,” Williams said.
“By me knowing him so well
on and off the field did hurt,
but also losing Gil [Sean
Gilbert] and Keith Hamilton
hurt me along with the whole
defense. Whenever you lose a
few very good ballplayers you

got to pick up the slack your-

self.”

He has done that by conduct-
ing the defense as if he were
leading an orchestra.

“We are like a big orchestra,”

‘ Williams said. “I’m just up there

telling people what to do and
let things happen how they
may. I wouldn’t say I’m the
leader on defense, but I just do
what has to be done.”
P Williams hesitated to evaluate
his season since it is not over
yet. .

“I really can’t say what my
grade would be if I graded

myself  after the season,” said’

Williams. “But as of right now I
would have to‘ grade myself as
being adequate. But I have to
step it up another notch.”
Williams feels that he is not
the only player on defense

who is having a good year.

“We have a lot of good
ballplayers,” Williams said. “I
can’t do anything without the
defensive line. In my opinion,
Vernon Lewis is the most con-
sistent ball player on the
defense without a doubt.
[Lewis] plays hurt and he has
been there week—in and week-
out. Lex Perkins, Gerald

nothing but positives when ‘talk-
ing of the 5-foot-11-inch, 188-
pound centerﬁelder.

“Derek Bochna is just a really
good -football player,” Paterno
said. “He plays the run as well
as anybody.”

For Paterno -- who most like-
ly will coach his final Pitt-Penn

State game on Saturday — his V

team won’t have any problem
getting up for the last game in
the storied rivalry until 1997.

“I would expect that [because]
it is Pitt, and since it is such a
traditional game forus — even
though it may be the last one
for a while — our kids will be
ready to play and will play with
a lot of enthusiasm,” Paterno
said.

The

Coaching also plays a major
role in what each player can do
on the football field. Williams
said likes the coaching style of
his position coach, Sal Sunseri.

“Coach Sal does an excellent '

Job,” Williams said. “Coach Sal
taught me the system to where
I know where everybody

should be lined up at and what ’

everyone does on the field,
including myself.”

Williams reflected over this
season and the possible high-
lights. '

“There are no highlights. We
‘are 3-7 right now, and that is
more disappointing than any-
thing,” Williams said. “People

only really remember what you
do in November. We are 3-7,
but when we beat Penn State
people will say, ‘Hey they beat
Penn State.’ And that should
put a smile on the Pitt alumni
faces, the students’ faces and
the football team’s faces.”

Williams said that it is not
hard to be motivated in spite of
the record.

“We motivate ourselves,”
Williams said. “We go out there
and say f—- everybody. The
defense goes out there and just
tries to hit, hit, hit, hit! We got
a lot of young guys on this
team team that are playing, and
everyone makes mistakes. Last

year around this time we had a
lot more players that had expe-
rience; and mistakes were at a
minimum.”

Williams expects Penn State
to come out strong against the
Pitt defense.

“I look for them to come out
trying to run the ball inside,
give Anderson the ball, and try
to use the play action against
us,” Williams said. “We are just
going to have to stop Penn
State’s offense.”

According to Williams, Penn
State is going to have to live
with a loss at the hands of the
Panthers until the series starts
back up again in 1997.

“We are going to beat Penn
State, and there is no ifs, ands
or buts about it,” Williams said.
“We don’t have anything to
lose, and we’re going out there
gung—ho.”

Williams said that the true
fans will stick with the team in
the down.times.

“If we wouldhave been 8-3,
people would have been jump-
ing on the bandwagon,”
Williams said. “Sure we are
having a bad year, but our true
fans are out there every home
game. We are entertainers, and
the fans haven’t been enter-
tained. For those people who
are our fans I say stick with us;

her solid defensive play and
rebounding.

“Before we went in here
against the Olympic team, we
didn’t say it, but we were
maybe a little intimidated,”
Huemrich said. “But we came
out here and played hard.
Everyone played well and did

While Humerich led the

honors went to Czech guard
Ja'na*:M_-atejkova who threw
down 22 points on seven-for-
14 shooting from the ﬂoor and
seven-for-11 shooting from the

every position, most notably

with 6-foot-3-inch center Irena
Blankova who towered over
the tallest starting Panther -
6-foot forward Turia Ransom.
Pitt’s own 6'3” center, Carolyn
Miller, was inserted to help
counter the Blankova, who
scored 17 points, but the,Pitt
front line continued to have
problems throughout the
night.

In the second half and over-
time, the Nationals crept back
to a tie. Crucial free-throw
shooting, key rebounds and
clutch three-pointers helped
seal the Pitt victory.

The Panthers were a com-
bined -17-for-25 from the
stripe, including a resounding
12-for-16 in the second half
and overtime. _

Erin Maloy led the Panthers
with five-for-eight three-point
shooting, including three
important treys down the
stretch.

“I had wide open shots,” the

junior guard said. “Jill
McElhinny and Jill Colabrese
gave me the opportunity. They
picked up their girl and then
she slid off [freeing Maloy for
the shot]. It took me a while,
but I finally got into my game.
The first couple of minutes I
wasn’t on, but I eventually got
into it.”

Bruce acknowledged that
Pittran offensive plays to get
the ball into the red-hot
Maloy’s hands. .

“We -told Mac [1111 McElhinny]
‘penetrate and dish to Erin,”
Bruce said.

Although not ringing up
impressive offensive numbers,
sophomore guard Carol
Morton proved to be a suc-
cessful catalyst off the bench.
Coming into the point-guard
position to spell Maloy,

Morton rang up two points

and two assists, but her most
telling statistic was" the three
steals she accumulated in lim-
ited playing time, proof of her

trademark explosive play.

“Carol’s a spark, no ques-
tion,” Bruce said. “She was
more under control tonight.
She played 14 minutes with no
turnovers and, to me, that’s
crucial.”

Czechoslovakian head coach
Miroslav Vondricka was also
pleased with the game.

“[It was a] very good game,”
Vondricka explained through
an interpreter. “[It was the]
best game [we have had] in

the U.S.A.”

The. Czechs must now travel
to play at Delaware on

_Thursday night, with five

games lined up afterwards.
They were playing in their
third game in three nights, but
Bruce does not attribute the
win to his opponent’s fatigue.
“They won last night’s game
by 30 points [against Robert
Morris] and their top players
did not play more than twenty
minutes,” Bruce said. “That’s
like half a practice. I don’t

think that they will start show-
ing fatigue for two or three
games, yet.”

The result of the game that
Bruce said was most pleasing
was his team’s state of condi-
tioning, which was well
beyond expectations. _

“[Conditioning] is something
you’re concerned

know until you get into a
game situation,” Bruce
explained. “We had our_main
people out there a lot, and all
of them’ were in pretty good
shape.”

Huemrich, Maloy and
Colabreseled the team in min-

utes with 42, 30 and 29 respec- ,

tively. Although each dove for
several loose balls, none were
noticeably fatigued when the
final buzzer sounded.

, Continued from page 9

“The Pitt-Penn State game is a big
enough rivalry that it will take care of
itself, no matter what the records are of
the two teams,” Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett said. _ -

“One of the. greatparts of Pitt football

' has been the rivalry with Penn State,”
_ said Johnny Majors, former Pitt head
> coach. ‘

In 1984, Pitt was 2-7-1 going'in\to- the
Penn State game. Pitt ended up winning
31-11 as it played its best game ofthe

‘ year at Beaver Stadium that day.

Also, the Panthers have beaten Penn
State only once at Pitt Stadium in the last
25 years but have beaten the Lions four
times on Beaver Stadium’s natural turf in

the same time period.

After Saturday’s game, the series will
be put on hiatus until early in the 1997

season due to scheduling problems,
mostly due to Penn State joining the Big
1.0 Conference. This will be the first
interruption of the series since 1935.

This breakage in play may take some
of the wind out of the sails of this great
rivalry, but it should should serve to fuel
the players’ emotions even more this
Saturday.

Saturday is the battle of two teams —

Pitt and Penn State — that have been.

stepping onto the field to play each
other since -1893.»

Both teams come into this game with
records of 0-0, because whatever hap-
pened over the past season is rendered
meaningless.

That is what makes things special in
football rivalries like Ohio
State/Michigan, Miami/Florida State,
USC/ UCLA and Pitt/ Penn State.

Continued from page 9
don’t mean much.” _

While McDufﬁe said he prefers
to shy away from comparisons,
Penn State head coach Joe
Paterno — not onefor lofty
praise —— has no problem lending
his opinion.

“OJ. McDuffie is as -good as
any football player in the country
— bar none,” Patemo said “He’s
as good as any a football player
as I’ve ever been around I used
to think Lenny Moore was the
best ‘player I ever was around.
OJ. would be in that class. He’d
be a great running back, he’d be
a great defensive back, he’d be a
great quarterback. He can throw
the football. And he’s obviously a
great wideout. He’s by far...he’s
just outstanding.”

Those are sublime accolades
from a legend who has seen
more than his share of superstars
in 27 years of coaching.

“I try not to worry about stuff
like that, but to hear it coming
from him — he’s seen so many
great football players, it’s a great
complement,” McDuffie said.

The 5—foot-11-inch, 185—pound
senior from Gates Mills, Ohio,
will play his last game in Beaver
Stadium when Pittand Penn State
tee it up at 4 p.m. on Saturday.
Although the 1992 seasonhas not
unfolded as McDuffie and his
Lion teammates anticipated, Penn
State’s all-purpose ﬂanker is hav-
ing a season most dream while.

McDufﬁe can take it the dis-
tance every time he touches the
football. It might be difficult to
stand out wearing the bland navy
and white uniform of the Nittany
Lions, but McDuff1e’s scintillating
abilities are impossible to over-
look. And unlike other supposed
burners, the ﬂash does not pre-
cede the substance.

“I think that he has power that
most [receivers] don’t have. He
obviously has the quickness and
the athletic ability and all that,”
Pitt head coach Paul Hackett said.
“I don’t know if he’s got the ﬂat-
out speed of Qadry [Ismail], but
the power that he runs with after
he has the football, his ability to
contort his body and twist around

and make plays is the thing that
really impresses you. I think he’s
just a marvelous football player.
He’s just a delight to watch. I just
hope I don’t have to watch him
too much Saturday.” . . ~ ~ ‘.

Through 10 games McDuffie
has 55 receptions for 865 yards-(a
15.7 average) and eight-touch-
downs. He has returned 12 kick-
offs for 295 yard (a 24.6 yard

average) and 28 punts for 253.
yards (a‘12.6 yard average). He.

will occasionally run reverses,
with ﬁve rushes for 110 yards.
However, these numbers barely
scratch the surface of McDuﬂie’s

dazzling performances when con- .

sidering his feathery hands,

explosive speed, jaw-dropping‘

moves and acrobatic catches in
traffic. ‘

He single-handedly brought
Penn State back for a near-mira-
cle rally against Boston College
on Oct. 17 — hauling in 11 pass-
es for 212 yards —— but the Lions
lost, 35-32.

With three catches for 46 yards
in Penn State's heart-breaking 17-
16 loss at Notre Dame last
Saturday, McDuffie broke the

Lions’ all—time record for receiving‘
yards in a season and tied both

the single—season and career
marks for pass receptions. His 55
catches this year tie him with for-
mer teammate Terry Smith, while
his 865 yards surpassed Smith’s
1991 mark of 846.

For his Penn State career
McDuffie has 117 catches, match-
ing Jack Curry’s numbers from
1965—’67. With his first catch on
Saturday, McDuffie will claim two
more Lion records.

“It would be nice. Those are
some good marks held by some
good receivers here,” McDuffie
said. “But it’s still an individual
thing. Having a good game
against Pitt is more important.”

McDuffie anxiously awaits
Saturday’s nationally-televised
affair, the last in the bitter Lion-
Panther rivalry until 1997.

“It’s one of the biggest rivalries
in the country,” he said. “It’s a big
rivalry for me, and it always has
been since I’ve been here at Penn

the film to push
the three-hour plus
running time.

There are other big
scenes as well, that serve
the same dual purposes.
Later, in Harlem, Lee recre-
ates Joe Louis’ homecoming
party after he wins the
Heavyweight crown. A mob scene
prevails on the streets, as people
jump for joy. The setting is again
wide and seen from above. It speaks as
much about the film’s epic characteristics
as it does about blacks struggles.

Sticking to the narrative of the novel, we
follow Malcolm through his big-shot days in

Director Spike
Lee has taken Alex
Haley’s stirring auto-
biography of Malcolm
X and blown it up on the
big screen, dazzlingly
bringing to life what the
book can only leave you
imagining. _

Malcolm X was a man of many
ﬂavors, and Lee allows the camera
and the words to highlight this. His
directing is never overbearing and
stays surprisingly restrained, allowing the
viewer to make up his/her own mind
about Malcolm. Lee clearly doesn’t want to
impose his judgement on the viewer.

For the viewer who thirsts for understanding,
Malcolm X is a gripping, intense history lesson.
But, for those who have read the autobiography or
claim an understanding of the outspoken black
leader, the film is engrossing. Seeing Malcolm on the"
screen, from a perspective that is refreshingly unbiased
and direct, is emotionally’ thrilling. Lee’s film is so well
conceived and polished that its length is never a thought.
Malcolm X never tires, largely because of the sensational
.Denzel Washington, who conveys all the stages of
Malcolm’s life with an intensity and grit that is so
compelling that it will elevate X’s persona to new
social accords. A

Malcolm X begins in the rippin’ ‘SOS, simpler
times when he went by the name of his hair
color — Red. Lee plays his misguided part-
ner in crime, Shorty, whose bouncy, ﬂail-
ing-arms strut says all you needto know
about him. The two are cheap street
hustlers who know how to swing.

In one of the film’s lavish cinemat-
ic stances, filmed in a ballroom,
Lee recreates a fantastic “joint is
jumpin”’ scene. Lionel
Hampton’s big band swings
hard as the duo works its
magic on the floor. The
scene is nearly five min-
utes long, but it’s
exquisite in detail
and stunning to
look at. It also
lets Lee and cin-
ematographer
E r n e s t

from West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). It is
Archie who turns Malcolm onto cocaine, money,
numbers and guns. “I was a social animal, a victim of

prison. ,

It is here that Malcolm earns his spiritual rebirth through
the guidance of Baines (Albert Hall), a devout follower of
The Nation Of Islam. This, not surprisingly, marks a tran-
sition in the film’s stance. Lines like “You’ve to take
every word the white man has and use it against
him,” and “take one step towards Allah, he’ll take
two steps towards you,” not only signify Malcolm’s
transformation but explain to the audience the
Nation of Islam’s teachings. When Malcolm is
released from jail and visits with NOI leader
Elijah Muhammad he -bursts into a stream of
thankful tears.

It is this Malcolm, a diligent and
devout follower of the N01, that is
most recognized in history books.
Lee and Washington’s Malcolm is
quite similar. He’s intense and
passionate. He is also so busy
that he resorts to asking Sister
Betty (Angela Bassett) to
marry him over the
phone. As scandals rock
the NOI and Malcolm
is silenced by the
ministers because
they feel he has
amassed too
much power,
he keeps on
believing.

Home Alone 2  lost in the

By Rob Pugliese

Sports Assistant

Home Alone was the highest-
grossing comedy and third-
highest grossing film of all time.
To duplicate its success will be

close to impossible. But produc-

er/writer john Hughes and
director Chris Columbus didn’t
have to look far for a magic for-
mula.

Unlike some sequels attempt-
ing to duplicate a blockbuster
original, Home Alone 2.- Lost In
New Yorle doesn’t add any
strange twists or new slants to
the mix. It often winds up back-
firing —- not adding any new
ﬂavor and just making the film
simple or disjointed.

Home Alone 2 follows the
original to the'utmost in hopes
that people will go see it again.
It worked once, why not twice?
You know the saying — if it
ain’t broke.

When dealing with a family
comedy that has a wealth of
“feel-good” qualities, this isn’t
bad strategy. The challenge is to
resurrect the exact same feeling

that the original gave viewers.
The entire cast returns intact
and plays out a similar plot with
similar misfortunes, pranks,
laughter and, of course, the
same outcome. Get the picture.

The set-up is perfect with its
timely holiday season release,
which only serves to enhance
the setting. And though it’s not
as effective as the first time
around, this fi1m’s levity pro-
vides definite entertaining quali-
ties, allowing you to enjoy the
atmosphere of the Big Apple at
Christmastime.

Kevin McCallister (Macaulay
Culkin) is back, still proficient at
getting himself in trouble.
Catherine .O’Hara and John
Heard are his worried parents.
Buzz (Devin Ratray) inherits his
old role of resident smart-
aleck/bullying big brother, mak-
ing Kevin miserable. The
McCallister’s are vacationing
again for the Christmas holi-
days. That means confusion.

With all the mayhem, the
scrambling McCallisters board

Redman
Wbut? Thee Album
Columbia/RAL

For the past six months, hip-
hop has been dominated by a
hard-hitting underground crew
known as”the Hit Squad.” Led
by the indomitable Long
Island duo, EPMD, this crew
received massive props with
the summer explosion of new-
comers Das Efx, and the sec-
ond release from K—Solo. All in
all, the Hit Squad’s hardcore
ﬂavor has smacked any pre-
tenders back to reality.

The most recent addition to
the Hit Squad posse is hitting
harder than Riddick Bowe,
with a fierce and funky rough-
neck style. Coming straight
outta Newark, N.J., it’s
Redman, the self-proclaimed
“funkadelic devil” and “origi—
nal P—Funk.”

Hip-hop fans first heard
Redman’s crazy style with his
cameo appearance on EPMD’s
third LP, Business As Usual.
Then came this year’s release
of Business Never Personal
where EPMD featured him,
along with Das Efx and K-
Solo, on the slammin’ single
“Headbanger.” This showcased
Redman’s wild delivery and

peaked interest for his solo
debut, which picks up right
where “Headbanger” left off.

His debut Wbut? Thee
Album is precisely what you
would expect from a Hit
Squad prodigy ready to
explode — a testament to
hardcore underground hip-
hop, with a completely funk-
laden ﬂavor. Redman, 22-year-
old Reggie Noble, has a
wealth of mad skills on the
microphone, weaving hard but
sometimes humorous verses
filled with metaphor and
toughened by his volatile
environment.

Co—produced by Redman
and EPMD’s Erick Sermon, this
record transports you back to
1970’s funk through heavy
samples of George Clinton,
Parliament, James Brown and
Kool and the Gang. Beneath
the sampling are aggressive,
hard-hitting beats that drive
the pulse of the album.
Lyrically, Redman seems will-
ing to spew anything, drop-
ping all kinds of pop—culture
names and references, but
never loses control of the mic.

Redman immediately estab-
lished his presence with the
major chart success of the first

The fevered dream of Dracula  

By Lori M. Bossert
Staﬁ" Writer

Bram Stoker’s Dracula, a film by Francis Ford
Coppola, is a lurid, fevered dream of a Film
which is mesmerizingly sensual at times and
nightmarishly jumbled at others.

Screenwriter James V. Hart has mixed the
storyline of Bram Stoker’s Victorian horror
novel with some vague facts about Vlad Tepes
(the historical basis for Dracula) and elements

NEW counsizs FOR SPRING TERM

Religious Studies 0435:  
Religious Themes in American Literature
Professor Paula M. Kane
Tuesday and Thursday, 2:30 - 3:45

This course will study approximately seven films and
related novels/texts which address religious themes and
delemmas. it will evaluate how film and fiction have
represented questions about morality, punishment, guilt, the
supernatural, the sacred and demonic, death, the afterlife,
established religion, and so forth. We shall also evaluate
how_film generated a new visual language to explore
religious feeling. Thus, we will focus our attention on
techniques of reading films and fiction, as well as on the
human experience of religion.

Spanish Culture From Dictatorship to Democracy
Professor Pamela Bacarisse
Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 12:00 — 12:50

This course will deal with Spanish culture since the so-

called destape (”taking the lid off”) and the subsequent

movida (new wave in the arts) which began with the death

of Franco in 1975, and in particular with the effect of the

abolition of government censorship of the arts. There will
be seminars and discussions of texts and films from before
and after 1975.

except Kevin, of course. But this time, he isn’t left at home.
He gets on the wrong ﬂight and winds up in N.Y.C.

That’s the ﬁlm’s central place of action, bringing Kevin’s
bumbling antagonists, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel
stem), into the picture. Having escaped from prison, “the wet
bandits” are planning more grand larceny, but they’re dumb-
er than ever.

Kevin takes residence at the Plaza Hotel up to his same
old scams, like using his dad’s credit card to check in and
ringing up a room service bill of nearly $1,000. He also finds
time to cause innocent mayhem for “Saturday Night Live’s”
Rob Schneider, who makes an appearance as Cedric the bell-
man.

Meanwhile, Mom faints when she realizes Kevin is missing,
and the rest of the family basically sits around while she
works on finding Kevin.

Wfhile wandering around Central Park, Kevin befriends a
homeless woman, the Pigeon Lady (Brenda Fricker), and
together they learn about friendship in a heartwarming side
plot that provides the only substantial difference from the
original.

The story heats up when Harry and Marv plot the grand
heisting of Duncan’s Toy Chest on Christmas Eve. Kevin
loves Duncan’s, the classic toy store for Christmastime com-
plete with trains and toy soldiers, and decides it is his duty to
step in when he discovers the scheme.

Throughout, Kevin repeatedly frustrates Harry and Marv,
making them look like complete idiots. The slapstick pranks
that made you laugh last time are even more extreme here
and actually get pretty violent, especially during the scenes
where Kevin thwarts the robbery.

But it doesn’t seem like real violence, more like a cartoon.

from bricks to wrenches to varnish to chemical explosives.
Imagine the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote turned real—life.
This scene is one of the movie’s most entertaining.

Kevin saves Duncan’s Toy Chest through the expected

Ryder), who tenderly bids him
what may be her last farewell.
The battle is then played out by
reddish silhouettes on the
screen, as Prince Vlad earns his
infamous nickname “The
Impaler.” Fans of gore need not
despair — the scene loses no
impact to the shadow photogra-
phy.

Dracul wins the day, but a
mistaken message of his death
causes the Princess Elisabeta to
ﬂing herself from the high turrets
of Castle Dracula. Overwhelmed
by the loss of the love of his life,
the prince is pushed past his
limits when his priest solemnly
intones that his bride’s suicide
has earned her eternal damna-
tion. Devastated _by the irony
that her life and hope of salva-
tion have ended on the very day
he has saved the life of the

church in Transylvania, he angri-
ly renounces both God and
church. As blood pours from his
castle chapel’s statues, he is
transformed into Dracula, the
infamous prince of vampires.

The film then jumps ahead
four centuries to 1897 London,
the starting point of Stoker’s
novel. It follows Dracula’s jour-
ney to London and the pursuit
of Lucy (Sadie Frost) and Mina
Murray (Winona Ryder), the
reincarnation of Elisabeta. The
storyline from that point is
loosely based upon the novel,
with the addition of Hart’s own
plot twists.

Persons who have read
Dracula may have an easier
time following this film. There is
simply too much in Stoker’s
novel alone to fit into a stan-
dard—lengt feature. Hart and

Coppola hi ve attempted not.

only to be as faithful as possible
to the original novel, but to
bring out the themes of the
attraction between Dracula and
his victims and his reincarnated
love affair with Mina. The result

is a film which almost never»_

focuses long enough on one sin-

seem somehow rushed, as if
Coppola is trying to ﬁt too many
symbols and images into one
movie. It could be argued that
this heightens the nightmarish
effect of the film, but it actually
lessens many of the film’s ﬁner
moments.

Similarly, we are never able to
connect with many of the char-
acters because of the film’s ram-

its tragic impact because the"

Dracula

Continued from page S-5
acter. Worse, the character of
Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony
Hopkins), Dracula’s nemesis, is
reduced to an eccentric profes-
sor who combines his knowl-
edge of medicine and the meta-
physical to ﬁght the monstrous
Dracula.

Although the direction is
uneven, there is still much to
admire in the film. The acting is
excellent — there is not a single
weak performance in the cast.

Ryder and Oldman are stellar in _

the principal roles, playing with
a deeply-felt intensity that is rare
in film. Jonathan Harker, Mina’s
mortal love, is played with quiet
dignity by Keanu Reeves, who
once again proves that his range
extends well beyond surfers.
Sadie Frost has an innocent sen-
suality as Lucy, handling her
conversion to a bloodthirsty
vamp with ﬂair. Anthony
Hopkins takes the character of
Van Helsing seriously, although
Coppola does not. Their perfor-
mances, as well as the rest of the
cast’s, help make this a film well
Worth seeing. .
When Coppola does choose
to dwell on a moment, some
stunning scenes result. The love
scenes between Oldman and
Ryder have a tragic beauty that

truly lives up to the premise that
they are mystically linked
throughout time. The image of
them Waltzing by the light of

thousands of candles is one of»

the most memorable in the ﬁlm.
Similarly well done is Lucy’s
death sequence, which is inter-
cut with the wedding of
Jonathan and Mina. Dracula’s
bloodsucking is unrelentingly
erotic, and elaborately sensual.
Shot almost entirely on
soundstages, the ﬁlm is visually
stunning. Reminiscent of
Golden-Age Hollywood epics, it
fills the screen with its grandeur
and mystique. Special effects
and unusual cinematography
make this one of the years most
striking films. Filled with lush
gothic imagery, the ﬁlm is worth
seeing on this basis alone.
Especially watch for Dracula’s
clawing, grasping shadow,
which has a life all its own.
Bram Stoleer’s Dracula is one
of the most long-awaited films of
this year. While it doesn’t always
measure up to expectations, this
is still one of the most thought-
ful, artistic films to come out of
Hollywood in quite some time.
See it for the ﬁlm art it honors so
very well, and buy the novel to
understand the plot and charac-
ters.

feeling to the conclusion. "

This film has received an
unbelievable amount of hype,
most of it due to Culkin’s mas-
sive stature. The most popular
child actor of our time, it is
Culkin alone who makes this
film. Kids love him, and for

solely that reason, this film
. could approach the financial

success of the original. And it’s
not all hype. Culkin’s magnetic
personality for children aside,
he’s talented. (See My Girl.)

So it’s the same movie, out to
make big-time money, and that
alone may turn a lot of people
off. But this is just simple fun,
and at many points, it’s hilari-
ous. If you’re above that, then
stay home. ‘

But Home Alone 2.-Lost In New
York succeeds in doing exactly
what it set out to do — dupli-
cate the blockbuster original.
Sometimes it can be fun to just
kick back and laugh at an
enjoyable story for a while.
That’s what this film is all about.

X

Continued from page S-1

have to change our way of
thinking, make them feel more
comfortable,” Malcolm tells his
followers of the Muslim
mosque. As the film winds
down, toward its dramatically
heartfelt and touching ending,
Lee makes one of his few
assertions toward the X lega-
cy.

Malcolm’s assassination has
often been disputed, but Lee,
through the words of Malcolm,
puts forth the belief that the

N01 is responsible. It is its.’

ministers who wield their
unfair justice toward Malcolm.
They are his assassins, trapped
in an awful conspiracy of mis-
trust and belief differences.
Throughout the sensational
film, Lee offers the narrative as
his basis for the Malcolm lega-
cy. But he sets the tone with

 

 

 

violent flashbacks of
Malcolm’s parents to sow the
seeds of hate that became an
integral part of Malcolm’s deﬁ-
ant speeches as a member of
the N01. Malcolm’s childhood
is one where Klansmen burn
houses and ride off into a
huge, blazing moon; where
evil schoolteachers urge the
bright X to pursue" a carpentry
trade and a raising in which
unsympathetic social workers

snatch children from their
struggling parents. In addition,

Malcolm’s mother despises her .

white half, the result of a rape.

It is these flashbacks, which
X never addresses as reasons
for his anti—white stance in the
film, which hint at his later
resentment. Even if he doesn’t
blame his upbringing, you get
the picture.

Throughout, Malcolm X is
spectacular. Shot to shot it

    

Angela Bassett and Denzel Washington share a tender moment in Spike Lee's Malcolm X

encompasses his controversial
past without attempting to
force an opinion on the view-
er. Washington’s performance
is ultimately memorable. Lee
said, “Malcolm’s spirit was in
Denzel throughout.” His han-
dle here makes it nearly
impossible to argue. While Lee
was eager to offer Washington
as an Oscar nominee, he was
less excited about his or the
film’s chances as a vote-getter.

appears to be sick of taking

Before Malcolm’s fatal assas-
sination, he is shown walking
toward the Audubon
Ballroom, in a weary state. An
elder black woman recognizes
him and says “Jesus will pro-
tect you.” It’s a sad scene,
emphatically so if you know
of the impending doom, but
one that says a lot about the
man and the filmmaker’s
attempt to reconstruct him. He
in no way was associated with
Jesus, but wholly with the
black race. Lee wants to point
to the fact that his message
wasn’t heard by all. With this

film, things should change

from all perspectives and
races. As Malcolm says again,
near the film’s end, “It’s a time
for martyrs.”

S_3  A ' THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Thursday, November 19, 1992

  

 

  

Contirmed from page S-6
Muhammad/ roll on like
Secret/me rip the crowd in
half/ on the sweet tip.” He’s at
his craziest with “I sting like a
b-bee while the others b-bum-
ble.”

Redman scores points with a
versatile delivery. Though he’s
rough on most tracks, he
occasionally smooths it out on
cuts like “Tonight’s Da Night”
where he flows nicely over
subtle horns and a soulful
Isaac Hayes sample. He teach-
es you “How To Roll A Blunt,”
one of his favorite pastimes.

Reared as a Sermon protege
(not a bad complement),
Redman credits the “E—Double”
for giving him this opportuni-
ty. That may put him in the
Hit Squad shadows of Sermon

 

7 and Parrish Smith for a while,

but that isn’t the worst thing
that could happen to a young,
talented emcee with crazy
talent. He’s ready to bust out.
If you’re down with EPMD
and funky hardcore hip-hop
that is true to itself, these mas-
sive grooves will keep your

' head nodding throughout.

Redman is dynamic enough to
stand on his own — even
without the Hit Squad connec-
tions. Check out this funky
trip, it’ll blow your mind.

-Rob (‘‘I D] like Pugs”) Pugliese

 

Peter Gabriel
Us
Geffen Records

Out of the environment —-

into the passion.

Following a five-year hiatus
from the studio, mostly spent
tooting his noble, throaty
tones for the likes of Amnesty
International, Greenpeace and

the anti-apartheid movement,

Peter Gabriel ﬁnally returns to
his true calling — producing
emotion-drenched works of

musical magic.

Long the voice of social and
ecological concern, the former
Genesis head man detours his
noble causes to his first album
since his multiplatinum 1986
S0 — opting for

release,
affairs of the soul.
Instead of social injustice,

it’s social life insecurities: opt-

ing for concerns of the heart,
sensual sensations of the
mind.

The result? A diverse collec-
tion of percussion-and-bass
saturated peaks and valleys
filled with passion and funk.
Even though it pales to his
blazingly-original past works,
it still tops most tune-toters in
the music world today.

Kicking things off for the
Gabster is “Come Talk to Me,”
a booming mid-tempo tune
that bellows emphatically from

the get-go — thanks to PG’s

patented plodding rhythm line

and a smattering of triumphant _

bagpipes. Radiating with a
longing for an unreachable
entity — namely the search for
a loved one — “Talk” tours
tempestuously through cum-
bersome yet dramatic imagery.

Gabriel’s lozenge-laced
pipes easily dominate the
track, overshadowing the filler
harmony work by special
guest Sinead O’Connor: “The
wretched desert takes its fall
 the jackal, proud and tight/
in search of you, I feel my
way  through the snowy,
steaming night/ whatever fear
invents  I swear it make no
sense/ I reach out through the
guarded fence  come down,
come talk to me/ the swirling,
curling storm of desire 
unuttered words hold fast.”
Though it’s a bit longwinded,
it’s still a mega-melodramatic
vibe. ‘

Your best bet for a solid
bass semi-groove comes cour-
tesy of the dreamy “Loved to
be Loved.” Yet another image-
fest, “Loved” pounds home the
whole uncertain, “wanting to
be wanted” concept in palat-
able fashion. It’s deftly capped
by a patented Gabriel throat-a-
thon: “And in this moment 
I need to be need/ with this
darkness all around me  I

 

  

like to be loved/ in this empti-
ness and fear  I want to be
wanted/ cuz I loved to
be loved  I love to be
loved.”

The theme of cleansing the
uncertain future comes alive in
“Washing of the Water” —— a
sleepy, strings—and-bass ditty
that shouts, “Please give ‘me
guidance!” out over the empty
canyon of heartache: “So
deep, so wide/ will you take
me on your back for a ride/ if
I should fall, would you swal-
low me deep inside?/ River,
show me how to ﬂoat/ I feel
like I’m sinking down/
thought that I could get along/
right here in this water  my
feet won’t touch the ground/ I
need something to turn myself
around.” Good stuff.

While sensitive tunes nab
top props of Gabriel’s latest
group of songs, a few upbeat
jams make their presence
known. “Steam” thrives on an
infectious horn arrangement
and yet another killer bassline;
“Digging in the Dirt” survives
on a mufﬂed bass groove and
the bellowing boasts of
Gabriel’s unique vocal maneu-
vers; “Kiss That Frog” —— a
silly-slick samba-shaker —
dives ‘tween your ears on the
wave of a drum-and-organ
assault. Like all tracks on the
album, this trio of songs live

to see another playback
thanks to the diverse duo of
Gabriel’s gabbing and the pro-
duction work by producer
Daniel Lanois.

Even though the funk comes
off as more accessible,
Gabriel’s strength remains his
ability to paint an emotion for
thesenses. Passionate
Pete’s sensuality shines bright-
est in “Blood of Eden” — a
smooth, harmony-filled duet
with O’Connor.

Sliding down the heaven-
sent violin background, video-
god Gabriel and cue ball
O’Connor mesh beautifully in
a scripture-laced ballad for the
ages. The sounds and the
words combine for the best
tune on the album: “I can hear
the distant thunder of a mil-
lion unheard souls/ of ‘a mil-
lion unheard souls/ Watch
each one reach for creature
comfuuuuurt/ for the feeling
of their words/ In the blood of
Eden  lie the woman and
the man/and the man in the
woman  and the woman in
the man.”

Overall, Us isn’t Gabriel’s all-
time, all-time —— but that
doesn’t dampen the accom-
plishment. It’s superb, believ-
able bantering from a brilliant
voice of the ages.

—Brian Gallagher
