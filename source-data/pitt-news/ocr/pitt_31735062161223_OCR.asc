War, Deficit

Hike Cost
Of College

By JOHN KULAMER

With one eye on the deepening
national emergency and the other
on this year’s red-inked ledger,
Pitt’s Board of Trustees today
had announced a hike of $1.50
in the tuition rate.

The raise, from $11.00 to $12.50
per credit hour, will mean an addi-
tional bite of 345 out of the wallets
of all those taking the normal sched-
ule loadof 15 credits, and brings the
average cost of a year’s attendance
at Pitt to $375.

The chief reason for the increase
was the fear that the near future
would see a sizable decrease in the
student body as the armed forces’
demands for manpower become
greater.

Mrs. Agnes Lynch Starrett, Uni-
versity editor, said that beside the
almost certain drop in enrollment,
there is yet no guarantee that the
services will take up any of the
slack with asubsidized training pro-
,gram as in the .last war .

Cost of Living Factor

The other factor in the raise is
?the general increase in the cost of
fliving which has carried over into
fthe field of education. .
A Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
fsaid, as things stand- n0W.. the school
‘«will operate at a deficit this year.

“This depends on whether we can
raise additional funds from other
3sources,” he said, “but at the pre-
sent time that is the outlook.”

The basic raise of $45 per year
l applies to all undergraduate schools,
but in many of the professional
schools it is greateryln the Dental
School it is $87.50, in the Law

Editorial

Something at Stake

This is a letter to 484 seniors.

We can’t list all your names; you are the se-
niors who have had pictures taken for the OWL
but haven't yet ordered your yearbook.

We are also writing to 100 undergraduates
who, "come sunny May, will want an OWL to help
them take home memories of a year at Pitt --
maybe their last year at Pitt for some time. We
don’t know your names -- yet, for your OWL or-
ders aren’t in.

We are writing to you because we feel that
you and we both have a stake in the 1951 OWL.
Our stake is that we want Pitt's OWL to be a
yearbook we as students and as a fellow publi-
cation can be proudof, and we think you "should
know how matters stand with the OWL because
you want the same good yearbook we do.

=4: agar * V ,

Your stake is this plus something more --
your own future pleasure in owning a yearbook of
this school year, especially if this is the year of
your graduation, and your picture is in the OWL.
Now, in the cold of winter, in the busy weeks be-
fore exams, that future pleasure may seem one
that doesn’t interest you much. But when you
have stood with your class to match up. and
across the commencement platform -- possibly
feeling hot in the sun and your black gown, but
with a suddenfeeling that you have done some-
thing worthwhile at Pitt, that you are going to
miss the place -- then you’ll feel different about

wanting a yearbook.
You will want something to help you remem-
ber the labs with their strange smells, the dry

silence of a library when you suddenly realize
that you have been so engrossed in work you
haven't noticed the quiet and the rustle of the

books. Or the fun of a dance when you listened
to the songs you will whistle the rest of your
life, even remembering some of the words. Or the
friends -- some of whom really will be your best
friends for life. That is why we have an OWL. It
It will help you to remember.

****

The OWL staff, students like us, only with
an even greater desire to make the OWL a book
worth having, are in a spot, a tough spot. With-
out going into the details they laid before the
Student Publications Board two weeks ago, they
are broke.

To get out an OWLof the kind Editor Leizer
Balk has planned and you want, and to get it
out in time for you to take-home next May, the
OWL must get orders for 550 yearbooks, and
must get them before January 15.

You will realize that this is an unusual
editorial. But we on the NEWS'think this is an
unusual emergency. And we urge you now (get
your feet under way while you hold this in your
hand) to order your OWL at the Student Desk
today.

   
 

High School Debaters Convene

Tomorrow representatives from 30 district high school debate
teams will attempt to talk their way to victory in the thirteenth
annual High School Tournament and Clinic at the University.

The purpose of the event, according to Fred S. Robie, director
of Men's Debate, is to "provide high school students with the

School 398, and in Medical School
the tuition went from $556 to $700
per year.

Second Increase llere

Mrs. Starret pointed out that the
raise is only the second at Pitt in
more than ten years. The first, of
‘$1, came in 1949. Percentagewise,
she said, the tuition increases here
are far below those at many other
colleges, and the total cost of edu-
cation here is still below average.

A check-up of college catalogues
showed that the credit rate atNYU,
for example, is $15.50, and a year’s
tuition at Notre Dame is about $470.

Complicating the school's finan-
cial problem was the fact that the
yearly appropriation from the state
legislature is still unknown. This
information is not expected until
April, when w'ork on the University
budget has already begun.

The action of the convention

for a referendum on the issue.

The council agreed to this and

Band Concert

Tonight

The Varsity Marching Band is
kicking off, and the Pitt students
are ready to receive the ‘musical
ball_’. ,

The action will occur tonight at
Carnegie Music Hall when the band
presents its 4th annual Stadium Re-
view.

This year’s program will be pat-
terned after a football game com-
plete with quarters, pre-game and
half-time shows, and officials.

The band, besides its varied
music program, will perform a spe-
cial pre-game entrance to show off
its marching prowess.

The Stadium Review was to be
held Dec. 8 but had to be re-sched-
uled for Jan. 5 because of the
Thanksgiving snowstorm.

Tickets are on sale at the Student
Desk. Student tickets are 65 cents
and general admission tickets are
$1.30. Tickets may also be pur-
chased from band members and at
Carnegie Music Hall the night of
the concert.

Classes Off
Thursday "

For Talk

By DONALD SHARAPAN
Major General Lewis B. Her-
shey, direcuor of the United
States Selective Service, will
address a University audience

' on one of the most pertinent sub-

jects of the day -- the draft -- "

next Thursday, Jan. 11, in Carnegie
Music Hall. _

Classes in all undergraduate
schools will be dismissed at. 10:30
a.m. for the general's discussion of
"Manpower Needs as Related to
i - College Students.”
It is'expected that
a question-and-
answer period will
end the hour-long
assembly.

The nation’s
draft director has
been asked to
speak by Student
Congress and Uni-
versity officials
 in line with the
Gen. Hershey University’s pro-
gram of presenting students and fac-
ulty with current, up-to-date infor-
mation on how the present national
emergency affects them.

 

General Hershey's appearance
here will probably coincide with
Congress’ anticipated broadening of
the present Selective Service act,
which is expected to include vete-
rans, married men, college students,
and others not yet affected by the
draft.

Some of the questions the general
will probably answer in his discus-
sion concern .the duration of college
students’ deferments, status of
ROTC students, whether students
in particular fields of study will be
deferred, when married men and vete-
rans may expect to be called in
force and women’s place in the draft

NORTN BERMAN
Berman Honored

By Fraternity

Norton Berman, president of
Pitt's Kappa Nu Fraternity, has
been named the fraternity’s out-
standing undergraduate student of
the year.

Recognition came in the form
of the Fagles Memorial Award pre-
sented to him at the fraternity’s
annual national convention in Bos-
ton on Dec. 22.

Berman is a pre-law senior. His
campus activities include vice-
presidency of Men's Council, and
co-chairmanship of the Customs
and Traditions Committee.

Eight members of the local fra-
ternity chapter attended the con-
vention.

Thus far, Pitt has held\out ad-

Overset
by BOB THOMAS

The appearance of Selective
Service boss Maj. Gen. Hershey
here at Pitt next
should prove more than valuable
if he is able to answer only one

question, Where does the student
stand in the draft?

For apparently the government it-
self doesn’t know, especially when
it comes to the college students.

Theories on what Uncle Sam in-
tends to do with his collegiate ne-
phews are thicker than football
bowl games on New Year’s Day.

 . Why So Late ?

In spite of the fact that it hits us in that tenderest anatomical
region, the pocketbook, we have only one criticism of the sched-
uled raise in tuition: It came about three years too late.

Although we appreciate the trustees’ apparent "desire to hold

off the increase as long as possible, we can’t help thinking that
their delaying action was similar to that of the softhearted surgeon

lier subsequent amputation.

vwho, in trying to save as much of a diseased limb as possible,

fails to be as drastic as necessary and is forced to make‘ a cost-

Without going into all the reasons why the increase is nec-
essary (most of which we aren’t familiar with) we can’t see that
there are any factors that exist today that weren’t also present
in 1948. _And we probably would have been able to meet the in-
crease a little less painfully at that time. Most important of all,
last fall's budget cut wouldn’t have been necessary.

Taken all together, it appears that maybe the University’s
financial .brains hadn't recovered from their wartime headache
when they boosted the cost per student by only a dollar in 1948.

Pass the aspirin, Dr. Carlson.

Paragraph Wisdom

One of our enterprising reporters brings us the news that not
everyone can use the Tuck "Shops. This news will come as a sur-
prise to those.who have. in the past, considered them rather ple-
bian establishments. We quote a sign that hangs in the Red Tuck:

"This Tuck Shop is maintained for the convenience of stu-

dents, faculty and University employees.

“We regret that we are unable to serve others.”

Just who are these others?

Just recently James C. O'Brien, as-
sociate director of the Office of
Manpower (also a man who should
know), said that examinations to be
taken, by all college-age youths will
decide who is to be drafted.

.Draft All-Alternate

Another strongly-backed plan is
that to induct almost all males
reaching the age of 18. This scheme,
calls further for only two years of
military training after which tim a
man would be free to "do what e
liked in the way of going on with
his education or getting a job.”

Of course this plan optimistically
neglects the looming possibility of
a long war. In addition it doesn’t
bother to say what the nation’s
1,031 colleges and universities are
going to use for students during
!those initial two years when any-
thing approximating college-age
meniiwillivanish into training camps.

You might also wonder what hap-
pens to the hundreds of thousands
of non-veterans who are in school
right now. Apparently so does every
one else. I

What About Veterans?

And veterans? Well your guess is
as good as anyone else’s. Married?
Four years in the Pacific? Wounded
three times? Fine. Except nobody
knows what these conditions mean

I The Pitt News 1

- Member, Associated Collegiate Press

Official student newspaper of the University of Pittsburgh. Published three

great 'gobs of American manpower.

So it’s up to men like Gen. lier-
shey. Let’s ‘hope he knows some-
thing.’

The University’s decision_to increase tuition from $11 to

up the need for Federal aid to

higher education. Colleges and universities have been fighting a
hopeless battle to hold tuitions down in the face of tremendously

Thurs day‘

at a‘ somewhat shabby level, per-
haps limiting the quality of’ in-
‘struction. The University is now
giving ground, but it is question-
able whether the new tuition boost
will enhance faculty salaries to
any great extent.

_ A still less cheerful coloring is
added to the picture by the fact that
Congress’ consideration of Federal’
aid has been shoved aside by the
more immediate demands of rearma-
ment. And if wages are frozen, fac-
ulty salary adjustments will just’
have to be put aside for the dura-
tion of the national emergency.

Ike in Right Place

The man who really runs Co-
lumbia University- -- not General
Eisenhower -- has finally emerged
from nonentity.

An article in last week's Time
Magazine introduced the public to
Grayson L. Kirk, who kept Colum-
bia functioning while Eisenhower
(scarcely an educator) ran around
the country making speeches on

the Cold War.

Now that Eisenhower has been ‘
appointed to organize the military
forces of the western nations, he
will perhaps be performing a task
he was trained for. Columbia,
mean-while, keeps the title of
president in cold storage for Ike,
refusing to give Kirk his due re-
ward. 1

Med School Quiet

“All quiet on the med school
front” -- that is the word from atop
the holy hill which was recently
shook when Asst. Dean Richard
Horn stepped into a mined field
at the Pre-Med Forum. As speaker,
he discussed qualifications for
med school and was met by some
pointed questions concerning the
"racial "and religious inquiries
_found in application forms.

Dr. Horn responded, by talking
in circles. Student Chairman Owen
Daley responded J by being alter--
nately embarrassed and angry.

Agendas of future pre-med for-
rums are likely _to feature such
controversial topics as the cori-
struction of the tibia, tarsus, and
metatarsus. \

Kids Not Bad

By ED JENSEN

The vet as a subyect for a column may now be just a little on’.

and minor virtues have made fine material for columnists for the
past five years. And as things stand it looks as though there will ,

This column I devote to those
vets who earned their status in the
last large scale conflagration. Spe-
cifically, I refer to those who are
here on the campus.

They sit around in the Tuck
Shops and in the cellar cafeteria
recalling the good old days when

the vet population far exceeded

Oliver -and Brentwood. The kids

have taken over and the school has
gone to the dogs, they wail.
Anymore a self-respecting warrior
must flee to the VFW or American
Legion clubs if he is to find a sym-
pathetic audience for his war yarns-

More Scholarly

Some of thevets, however, do not
bother to criticize their younger
brethren merely because of their
woeful lack of years. Theirs is a
more scholarly, more penetrating ar-
gument. They claim the younger
students have lowered the teach-
ing and scholarship standards on
campus. They say the more mature
veteran is restrained by his younger
classmates.

With pride they point to the thou-

system has gone to pot.

Not So I

True the student of the immediate
postwar years was'old‘er, a little
maturer and more studious than the
student today. He devoted more
'time to academic activities and
less time to extra-curricular acti:
vities. And he often had a reason-
ably good reason for attending
school, or rather, he couldfgive
you a reason why he was here.

But it is not immediately prov-

able that educational standards
were appreciably raised. The
number of high grades may have

soared, attendance may have been
better, and collegeboy capers may

have been reduced; but that one ,1

debatable proposition. It is justf

routed the villains, 68-62.

For sheer perfection in the perfor-
mance of their respective rol_es—
and I am not referring merely to the
young men in underwear— there have
been few recent nights in the world
of entertainment to equal this one.

Let us consider the cast:

With Hairy Chest _

1—There is young Michael
Belich, short but hairy chested-
indeed, a veritable David felling
Goliaths by reason of his 28 points.
In his portrayal Mr. Belich gave us
no scintillating personality, but his
purpose on stage was to make
points and this he did with aplomb

ii;
the tyrannical officials. E derly Dr.
Carlson appeared in tan pastels,
single-breasted. He wears pastels
well. In the course of his perform-
ance, his face passes from pink to
rose to scarlet—- all harmonious with
pastel fabrics.

But to get on, the game was
scarcely underway when the Doctor,
reading his script vehemently, op-
ened a campaign against the offi-
cials for not calling illegal travel-
ing on the enemy. His script relied
on repetition. “What the hell do you
guys call steps?” he shouted.

' And a moment later, “What the
hell do you guys call steps?” And
another moment later when Umpire
Arthur Graham fell into his lap chas-
ing a play, "What the hell do you

call steps?” *
Rose in Fury
Failing to get an answer, Dr.

Carlson soon rose in fury, and it
was evident to the most amateurish
lip-readers in the 25th row that he

the officials.
Bearing in mind though that last
night's cast was a varied one, the
direct antithesis of the Doctor "Was.
presented by:

3—Grover (Pappy) Washabaugh, a
Percy Kilbride who led the opposi-
tion. Pappy is an elderly, amiable
man, the type you expect to settle
down toa chicken farm any day now-

Throughout the first half Pappy
remained quiet and seated, living
up to the stereotyped performance
he long ago fashioned. But as I
said, this was an exceptional eve-
ning, and "Pappy eventually rewarded
the audience with new twists to his

  
 

old role.
Finally Uncoiled

In the second half a deliberate,
two-shot foul was called on his
team,, prompting the usually mild
Pap to uncoil from the berich. Al-
though managing a broad smile, he
nevertheless waved contemptuously
at the officials and declared:

. “Ahhh, shucks. Hey, ahhhh,
shucks.”
In itself, this was enough to

shock his acquaintances. But later
when he rose and gritted his teeth
and mumbled curses, you knew you
were seeing a Pappy Washabaugh
never before portrayed.

To get on with the cast, however,
there was:

4—Referee Zigmund (Red) Mihal-
ik, a Bette Davis in pants.

Adds Rare Zest

Zigmund has been criticized for
overplaying his part in the past, but
personally I think he adds a flavor
rare and precious. In pre-game ‘in-
structions to the captains, Zigmund
points to the north basket as if he
discerns Indians on the horizon.
He follows with swan dives, air-
plane spins, and hallelujahs.

, His words are bitten off in the
manner of “Blue bells and cockle
shells, eevy, ivy, ovy.” Red bush-
es above his eyes rise and fall.
Every muscle activates.

Playing the tyrant, Zigmund’s
manner easily infuriates the audi-
ence, and before the night is over,
they have called him "Communist’_,’

was questioning the lineage of

and told him to “go to Korea.” His

important, his dramatic performance

Briefly, now, let us consider the
one poor performance of the eve-

am. Mr. Graham appeared as a man
lost. The traffic was running full-
tilt on the boulevard, and Mr.
Graham was caught out in the mid-
dle of the street.

Confused, but insistent ,upon
making his presence known, he
would intermittently file a decision
characterized by uncertainty. The
audience was discriminating. They

Belich, Sprks Upset of Titans

Mike Gets 28 Points
As Pitts Win, 68-62

By WILL DOERGE
Apparently all that Pitt's basketball team needed was a
chance to perform on its home hardwood, for it decisively whip-
ped Westminster in the Stadium opener last night, 68-62.

The Panthers will now be out

to make it a winning streak of

two tomorrow night when they face the Geneva Covenanters in

another home attraction at 8:15 p.

m.

Led by the great shooting and floor play of little Mike Belich,
the Panthers snapped an eight-game on-the-road losing streak in
surprising the Titans, the same Titans who ran Duquesne silly

before losing a disputed one-pointer A

last month.

Outran Titans
But it was the Panthers who ‘out-’

ran the speedy Titans last night, »

and that's going some. Who knows,
with more home games, Pitt might
have been able to pile up a ten-
game winning streak, alaDuquesne.

Pitt won its game the hard way-
no charity from the officials. West-
minster scored 22 points from the
free throw line to Pitt's 10.

Belich scored 28 points, 16 of 

them coming in the third quarter
when Pitt came from behind, 33-29
at halftime, to take a 54-49 lead at
the third quarter mark.

Belich Brilliant

Then, in the final quarter, with
the score 57-all, Belich capped
his brilliant performance of the eve-
ning by setting up three successive
lay-up shots which put Pitt aheadto
stay. A

George Hromanik and Scotty Phil-
lips netted the scores: on Belich’s
feeding, giving Pitt a 63-57 edge
with five minutes remaining.

Belich’s scoring output brougut
his season's total to 181 points
in 11 games. He is averaging more
points a game than Sammy David
when the latter set the all-time Pitt
scoring record of 390 points in
1948-49.

The Panthers now have a record
of 2-9. Their opponent tomorrow,
Geneva, has a record of 2-7. Al
Vlasic (6-3), the big gun offthe Cov-
enanter attack, has tallied 145
points for fourth place in Tri-State

scoring.

Notes from Pitt’s basketball tour
of the West: The Panthers sorely
missed soph ace Art Boyd who is
recovering from a virus infection...
“We could have won four games on
the trip with Boyd in. the lineup,”
said Doc Carlson.

Iowa’s victory over Pitt was its
first over a Panther basketball team.
Pitt heldfive wins over Iowa, all on
the llawkeyes’ court.

"We were overwhelmed like a’
tent,” said Carlson commenting on
the opposition’s superior height in
every game. . .l'le summed up the trip
with, "The boys had a good time,
got along well together, saw the
scenic sights, and lost eightgames.”

'3)’ SA“ SPATTER

A Pitt freshman’s love for a base- 

ball career has deprived the Univer-
sity of probably the tallest basket-
ball player on campus.

Ken Strom, 6-7 former Westing-
house lligh eager, signed a profes-
sional baseball contract with the
Brooklyn Dodgers last summer, thus
making him ineligible for collegiate
competition.

The husky 220-pound freshman,
who will be 19 next month, was
signed by Dodger Scout Ray Walsh
after pitching in the annual all-star
American Legion game in this dis-
trict last summer.,Pirate scouts
were also interested in Strom, but
Walsh swung Strom into the Dodger
camp with a bonus offer. Strom was

paid below the $6,000 mark however, 

and is not considered a bonus player.

Pitt vs . Dodgers

"1 would like to have played for  . ..

Pitt,” remarked Strom, '”but I could
not pass up the chance of signing
with an organization like the Dod-
gets.”

Ken's height and basketball pro-
wess would indeed have lightened
Pitt’s basketball burdens in the
future. While a three-year member
of the Westinghouse squad, Ken
proved a valuable rebound man as
well as team player with his skill-
full feeding of the ball to sharp-
shooting teammates. '

During his years at Westinghouse,
the school won several city titles.
Last year Strom graduated in Febru-

SAM Upset

5 PiKA, 27-25

If the opening intramural games
of the new year are any criterion,
this should be a season of upsets
and surprises in IM basketball.

Sigma Alpha Mu, the Sammies,
who finished deep in the cellar
of the Fraternity League last sea-
son, upset the favored PiKAs, 27-
25, in a game played at Trees Gym
on Tuesday.

The Sarrimies lost the lead only
once in the game. The»PiKAs, who
were in the playoffs last season,
seemed to find themselves late in
third period, pulling from behind,
21-12, to lead, 23-22.

But Harvey Feldman of the
Sammies, who was high scorer with
16 points, put his team back in the

’ lead to stay.

Phi Cams Win

After being given a rough time,
the Phi Gams overcame a four point
deficit to defeat Alpha Phi Alpha,
33-22, in a Fraternity League game
at Trees Gym, Wednesday evening.

The general trend of the game was

rough and tumble ball, as a low
scoring, tight game prevailed in the
first half. Alpha Phi Alpha led the
Phi Garns at halftime, 18-14.
George Alcott paced the victors

with 16 points.

On the road and in the laboratory, Du Pont scientists are writing

7712 /m’/'a’e .$’7‘o(y olffng/he Pepe:/‘Its’

Engineers have long known that de-
posits which accumulate in gasoline
engines have a direct bearing on en-
gineperformance. Even now, how-
ever, no way has been found to elim-
inate these deposits or their effects.

As a manufacturer of chemicals
used by the petroleum industry, the
Du Pont Company has a particular
interest in this problem. It is cur-
rently the subject of a comprehensive
research project, conducted both on
the road and in the laboratory.

When Du Pont engineers began
their studies, some aspects of the re-
lationships between engine, fuel, lu-
bricant, operating conditions and de-
posits were known. But to understand
how and why deposits form and to
develop corrective measures, they
needed additional information.

Engineers take to the road

To get these facts, Du Pont engi-
neers are supervising tests in a ﬂeet
of passenger cars and trucks that
travel hundreds of thousands of miles
yearly under carefully controlled con-
ditions. The effects of deposits on
octane number requirement, valve
performance, spark plug condition
and other performance characteris-
tics are measured. After each test,
the deposits are weighed and ex-
amined physically and chemically.

In the laboratory, other engineers
study the effects of the same vari-
ables on multicylinder engines. Here,
where closer control of the engines is
possible, greater attention can be
paid to speciﬁc fuel or engine operat-
ing effects. Performance factors, such
as power output, can be more con-
veniently measured.

A third group of Du Pont engineers
uses single cylinder engines in lab-
oratory studies of deposit formation,
adhesion, removal and harm. Explor-
ing new ﬁelds, these men had to de-
sign complex instrumentation for
measuring factors such as surface
condition and deposit thickness.

Chemists synthesize deposits

Chemists, too, have an important
place in this research. They study
the chemical and physical character-
istics of engine deposits. Among other
things, they devise ways of synthe-
sizing, in ﬁred engines, deposits con-
sisting almost entirely of a single
chemical compound in order to study
its effect on engine performance.

The results of this comprehensive
research program are not yet con-
clusive, although the relationships
between engine, fuel, lubricant, op-
erating condition and deposit forma-
tion and harm are much better un-
derstood. In the past Du Pont scien-
tists have licked even more difficult
problems. Working as a team, they
will persist in their effort to provide
the motorist with improved engine
performance through better fuels.

Educated in

  

Germany,

She Viewed Occupation

B)’ ANNE GUSSIN
Many girls attend neighborhood high schools, then go away to
college.. But Kay Murray, sophomore in the College, has reversed

this situation.

Kay, a bacteriology major, went to high school in Stuttgart,

Germany, from 1946 to 1949.

“The school I attended was really 4

in Heidelberg. It was a school for
American children of the occupa-
tion,” remarked Kay, whose father
worked with the state department
in Germany.

The pre-med student went on to
explain that school officials tried
to make the high school comparable
to those in America. “We had extra-
curricular activities,” she ex-
plained, “even a school newspaper
and cheerleaders for the football
games. Our football opponents were
from the five other American schools
in Germany.”

Attitudes Change ,

Kay noticed a change in the
attitudes of the German people
during the time the Murray family
lived there. "We arrived there right»
after the war,” she commented,
“when conditions"were horrible..
The people were very bitter. But,
as they got more food, they became
much ‘more friendly.”

“Americans are inclined to stick
together too much in occupied

countries,” the dark-haired sopho-
more continued. "The very young
children mixed with the young Ger-
mans, but because of the facilities
for American youngsters, most of
our contact was with other Ameri-
cans.”

Germans Resented‘ U.S.

During the crucial post—war years,
the German people ‘seemed to re-
sent foreigners. “They resented
Americans, too,” Kay explained.
"They did prefer them to Europeans,
though, because Americans made a
more sincere “effort to give Germany
back to the Germans.” ,

When the Murray family returned
to Pittsburgh, Kay enrolled at the
University.“Living in Germany was
fun,” she concluded, “but it was
so good to return to America and
attend college at home.”

Harbison To Speak
At Pre-Med Forum

Dr. Samuel P. Harbison, chair-
man of the surgery department of
the School of Medicine, will ad-
dress the Pre-Med forum from 1:30
to 2:30 p.m. Thursday in 144 C1.

Besides speaking on “The Young
Doctor--His Preparation and Out-
look”, Dr. Harbison will also dis-
cuss the effect of war on the young
doctor.
