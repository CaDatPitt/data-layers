University councils, but inertia has
militated a.ga.inst it. The arguments
for itare "less in the nature of
criticisms of the present system, of
which there may be well-founded
ones, than of the positive. advantagesgi
of the proposed enterprise. These are
(.1) The lowest and most reasonable
prices possible on all books and sup- L
plies necessary to the maintenance of‘
student life. (2) A yearly proﬁt-
sharing dividend‘ to the sustaining;
members, according to the extent of
their interest. (3)0 The element of
-united responsibility and efficiency
which such a store would give to the
students and others who participated
(L4) The ﬁlling of an insistent

tional and intellectual center of
xPitts.b-urgh, of a. store purveying the

lift of the cultural“ standards ‘of the
community. (5) The management un-
der one trained business , man who.
could -devote all his time to the busi-
ness, with student assis.tan.ts, all ade-
quately salaried, and the net proﬁts.

“I regret not having graduated from

    DIRECTORY UNKNOWN LIST  

As the work of revising the Alumni Directory progresses, many letters
will be returned which did not reach the alumni to whom they were ad-
dressed. This is in many cases due to the alumni movlng and leaving no
address to which mail can be forwarded. These letters, when returned, are
carefully sorted byclasses and departments in the Alumni office, and lists
will be published each week In the PITT WEEKLY. Alumni will confera
great favor by looking over this list regularly and seeing if they do not
know an address of some of the Unknowns; .. If one cannot be secured, In '
this way, or through some of theother methods pursued by the Alumni ,0f-
ﬁce, the names of those alumni will have to be published in the Directory
without and address, which is not desirable.

l00KlNG rm OVER  

Our well wishes to Captain Lou Mc-
Master who is ﬁnishing strong, after
an operation for appendicitis_. Of
course he has our sympathy, but it
seems that the Track team and Alma
Mater needs part of that thems-elve"s.

 

 

Have youheard the latest? A rumo-r
has spread around the venerable
halls and campus of “old Uni,” to the
effect . that the “more deadlier than
the male” sectio-n of our fair school
have designs «on winning the annual
inter-department track meet. On the
strength of this demonstration _num'-
bers of the future, Jane Addamses,
‘Mrs. Pankhursts, Emma Goldsmans.
and other owners of the “hands that
rock the (cradles), and other things”
are busily getting in training onthe
rink at the Duquesne Garden, al-
though many prefer the..spacious ball
room of the “Bill” Penn. Still others
reduce weight thru strenuous exercise
secured in walking every afternoon

down into the Oakland district where,

they are usual1y,“sStranded~”, aided and
abetted by the “sturdy oaks” who for
the price of a “thin one” entice the in-
nocent misses from their training.
Ain’t it awful, girls!

 

The long-haired word manipulator
that said “in the spring a young man's
fancy,” etc., you know it‘ as well as
I, certainly must have lived before the
establishment of our national pastime.

i'I~‘h,e crack of the bat“ again the ball

and the thud of the horsehide as; it
lands in the cgatchers Imlit is . being
anxiously awaited, by all lovers of the
sport. Only, a.‘~ short time now until
those two bits will be rolling from
our pockets, into the coffe-rs” of the Pi-
rate owners.

 

A couple, oft-he old boys were dis-
cussing, the Willard-Moran ﬁght and

one of them mentioned the fact that}

Jess must certainly have the goods to
have given Moran the lacing he did.
Another of the men who was formerly
connected with athletics at the Uni re-
called the day back about .1907 when
Moran who was ‘hanging around, the
Pitt football team and, incurring’, the
wrath of one of ‘the players, the
present ﬁghter -was put to rout long
before 10 rounds were up.

 

We hate to predict anything in re-

ference to the chances of our, nine this

spring. To ,tell the  we“don’t see

be pessimistic, butwe are just saying
that to fool the jinx, for last year we

 Gloom Jinx sure did jinx us-. So
this, year we can’t ‘see anything but

big gobs of golom carrying bitter de-

feats. Not that we are superstitious, ,
V you understand, but one might as well

be on the safe» side.

......l____.

Superstition is all bosh and needn-

cated person is influenced by signs or‘

cmens—~at least _A that is what our
[learned profs in Psych. tell us. How

never the Blue, and Gold Varsity bas-
ketball team were their whitejerseys

in the game they lost ..to: -Lehigh and
the next day Manager S. D. ‘Flinn had
nine nice," nifty, natty basketball jer-
seys for sale. i .

 

Speaking of basketball‘ the way in

. which the team was handled this year -
by the managegrwas such-as to reflect

credit on; hlimselfancl, -topthe school.
The “ schedule was‘ without exception,
the hardest ever arranged for a local
team, but -the teams were so dated
that the athletes were never handi-
capped by fatigue resulting from too
many hard games scheduled together.
The crowds far surpassed any that

’ have ever turned out before and the ;

rapidity in , which they were handled

and the little friction. resulting was -

certainly remarkable.’ The visiting
teams, without’ exception, expressed
their .pleasure for the courteous Way
in which, they were treated_ while
here. This means a/great deal in es-
tablishing Pi.tt’s reputation as an ex-

O’ ponent of clean sportsmanship. Our

hats-off to the retiring manager S. D.
Flinn. “  ""' “" ” ."

 

George E. Hes-selbach-er, for the past
two years the mainstay in the box for
the Penn State Nine, is lost to the
team this year, «having undergone an
operation in the Episcopal hospital in
Philadelphia a few days ago. With the
lanky twirler out of the game the
chances of the Nittany crew on the
diamond are given a bad ‘ljolt.

Mike Dorizas, the heavyweight in-
ter-collegiate wrestling champion is to

A fair illustration of a paradox may
be had in the picture of Sutherland,
Soppit and Stahl listening to the ﬁght
returns and the while advising one
another that in the case he was as
big as either of the‘ other members
of the party he would try for a crack
at Kansas Jess. .

The inclement weather still pre-
cludes any immediate possibility of
outdoor practice by the Blue and Gold
diamond aspirants. The probabilities
are that there will be no real outdoor
work carded ‘until next week, due to
the condition of the grounds which
will require work and balmy weather
before a practice is possible. In the
meantime the fans about the Uni-
versity are amusing themselves specu-
lating on the probable personnel of the
team.

.As far as any realadvance material
is concerned, the best dope is little
more than mere speculation, for little
can be -told of the eventualities that
the season will bring forth.
Wilson has issued a. call for the Val‘-
sity men and a meeting will take place
in the Gym some time the latter part
of the week, and until then affairs are
practically in the shadow.

Of course there are certain general-
izations that may be asserted with
safety. In the ﬁrst place itis sure that
an entire new outﬁeld must be discov-
ered for this year's aggregation. All
of the men who started the season
la-st spring are either out ofschool or
ineligible; Dillon, Engelhardt, Morrow

 

and , Gray, forming one of
the best aggregations of
outﬁelders that has Worn the

Pitt colors for severalyears, are all
lost to the 1916 team. Matson and
Beattie will alternate between the
back stop and o1ie‘of-the outﬁeld posi-
tions. Forney, from last year’s Fresh-
man squad, may step into_ one of the
garden notches, while the other might

baseball roster. There is, however, a
possibility that “Johnny” Hays, of the
’14 Varsity, will beagain on the job
this year. “Red” Carlson, captain of
the '15 Yearlings, will be in the run-
ning for Hea1y’s place and there is
some ﬁne material in prospect for the
first corner position. ~ _

Capt. Beattie’ and Mat-son will be
available as catchers withlFreelander
in reserve. Blane Curry, of Punxsu-
tawney. would probably b.e..a_h.19. £9. ,1e¥-..l<1
‘aliberth behind the bat were,-the eligible
for the attempt. In the -persons of
L-angdon, Hart, Reihl and Kennedy,
Pitt is possessed of a veteran slab
squad that will be hard to equal.

In the meanwhile, due attentionsis
being given‘ to the schedule thatthe
team will pursue this season. The east-
ern trip is an attractive part of the
card. It includes six games, two of
which will be played with the Navy
and one'with,West‘ Point. The other
new departures. in the program of
games. is held in the character of con-
tests with Syracuse and the University
of Buffalo. These games will be the
ﬁrst contests of the season.

_ The Syracuse vmeetprioved ’al costly

*“Lou” McMaster for the rest of the

year. He was disabled in his ﬁrst at-
tempt in the pole vault, which result-

ed in a recurrence of appendicitis. He
is now in the Presbyterian Hospital,

North Side, and is getting along very
well. His operation proved successful

owing to his pe.rfect physical develop.

ment. However, he is thnu with ath-
letics as he will graduate from the
Dental School this year. . '

Lou is one of the best students in

his class, as well as being one of our
most valued athletes. He is known
all over. this section of the country
as a track man, but his prowess is not
limited_to; this sport. Lou was one of
our bright. stars on the champion.
ship basketball team, having. made
more goals, from. the ﬁeld than any
other player on the team.

.McMaster has also made a repu-
tation for himself as a baseball and
football man, but had to give them
up because of his studies. In his
ﬁrst year he was a. ‘member of the

.Fneshlm:an football team, but was too

light to make the Varsity.
. He is one of the best pole. vault-
ers in Western Pennsylvania, having
won the Middle Atlantic Champion-
ship in this event last year. In 191.4
he was the high individual point win-
ner in‘ track in the University. At the
Penn Relays, he ﬁnished third in the
Penthalon competing against some of
the best runners in the country. A
However, his loss will be felt the
most in the pole vault and the low

hurdles. In the former, we have Eas-

terday and Hugus and probably two
or three new men to depend, upon,
but none to be compared with M-cMas-
ter. In the low «hurdles there are
no experienced men, as -Scott will be
unable to compete, and thus we will
have to depend entirely upon new
material. The broad jumpwill be

-taken care of by Johnny Sheehan, the

well known star. .

Lou. was the fourth athlete to be
operated on in the last two years.
Peck, Williamson and DeHart were
the other mento be. subject to the
surgeon’s care, but their loss was not
felt to the extent that McMaster’s
is, as it did not come at a time which
would interfere withtheir athletic;

A call has been issued for all men
who are interested in tennis to «hand
their -names to»H'. S. Haines or to Di-
rector of Athletics 0. s. Miller with-
in the next few days. Only one or
two of last year’s team will be on
hand this year to uphold the Blue

and Gold on the courts and as there

are several positions to ﬁll it is de-
sired to get as many contestants as
possible. -

The announcement has also been
made that there_will be an eastern

trip again‘ this year, It wasthought
to call thisoﬂ this year but the man-
agement has lined up several of large
eastern schools and ’ the team . will
take the annual trip sometime in
May. It is hopedlthat as soon as the
new courts are built at the ;Univer-
sity that it will be possible not only
to ,work up men for intercollegiate
contests but to institute a schedule
of interclass or interdepartment_\con-
tests. This would act as an incentive
for more of the students to come out
and participate ‘in University ath-
letics. ,

Tihe subscriptions for membership
in the Tennis’. Association should be

handed to Haines or to any of the

athletic authorities» as soon as pos-
sible. If the students show that they

‘ are-, sufliciently interested, the Athle-
tic Council. of the "7 University will

probably help build the courts and
will care for the upkeep. Tihe need of
tennis courts‘ has been felt at . the
school for some time. Get out and

Only second, in point of interest, to
the Varsity baseball affairs, comes the
spring season of the Yearling squad.
As a matter of fact the practice of the
Freshmen will‘ be merged with that of
the Senior squad during the ﬁrst few»
weeks until the time for division‘ar-
rives. The opening date will depend
upon the condition of the weather dur-
ing the next few weeks. ‘ I

The personnel of the Freshman team

is, as yet, a mere matter of specula-
tion. There has been no call issued
for candidates and there is no way of
ascertaining the material that will be
‘available. T ere are, however, ‘a num-
ber of men a Pitt who were stars in
their respective prep schools who will
without a doubt lend their services -to
‘the ﬁrst year organization.

The schedule that has been arranged
for the Freshmen is worthy of the
most favorable criticism. Manager

 

,Bixby. has been devoting a: great deal

of attention to this work and has suc-
iceeded‘in securing a very favorable
program. The games, except two, will
be played away from home, so that the
trips should be an attraction to Fresh-
men who have baseball ability. The
games of the greatest note are those
that are to be played with Kiski,

In an interviewfwgiven out to as
Weekly reporter Monday, Charles S.
Miller, Director of Athletics, had the,
following to say in reply to the note
in the last issue of the Weekly re-
garding a training table for Pitt. ;

“The athletic authorities have con-
sidered establishing a training table ,
at various times and we believe that
it would ‘not weorkhat Pitt. It is all .
right for the school where all classes".
are over about 2:30, but here’ the

Would be very difﬁcult to fix an hour;‘ _

_ “A large number of the students
live in ‘Pittsburgh and eat at home
where they get meals just as good
and just as palatable as any that we
might serve at a training table. Then ,
we must take into consideration the"
men who’ are waiting on tables; an‘dJ
get their meals free. If a. training
table were introduced, it would be?‘
necessary for them to pay for! all

Lack of exercise is often responsible
for kidney diseases. A healthy mind is
only possible in a. healthy body. This
is‘. the most beautiful thing in the
world-. Exercise inspires courage and
conﬁdence. Lack of exercise results in
the dull-eyed, weak, ﬂat-chested, weak-
minded individual. Lack of oxygen in
the body soon produces fatigue. Mental
exercise should be followedby physi-
cal exercise. , This would give the body
the supply of oxygen wlhich is neces-
sary in order to resist it. The cane
of the body is just as necessary as the
care of your machine or business. The
human body may be compared to an
auto. When properly treated the parts
are sound, 4, there is. no strain and
the efﬁciency is high. In order to live
in the bestposslible way, activity and
relaxatioln should follow each other,
with proper periods for food and rest.”

The next lecture - will be aheld on
April 5 and -Professor Roswell H. John-
son, of the school. of mines faculty,
will be ‘ the vsspeaker. His topic will
be “The Individual Responsibility of
the Infherent Quality of the Race.”

ADDRESSES GIRLS

Mrs. Laura H..France, instructor in
the Women’s Physical Training De-
partment of the University, gave the
hygiene lecture to the Freshmen girls
on Wednesday, March.12tZ. Her sub-
jectowas “The Value of Physical Edu-
cation.” She said in part: ’

“Physical training has many and
varied beneﬁts.’ First and most im-
portant, it aids greatly in promoting
general .heal.'th and in keeping the
body in a sound and normal condi-
tion. Then, too,‘ it acts as a most
beneﬁcial factor in the development
of the muscles and the various or-
gans of the body. It aﬁords relaxation
and does away with profound laziness.
Finally, it keeps one from assuming
an attitude -of indolent idleness and
as a substitute attain a healthful tired-
ness.”

(Continued from page 1)

Professor Berger was born in Frank-
fort, Gemany. lie received his early
training in the Fatherland and came
to this country at an early age. ‘He
began teaching at W U. P. in 1902,
receiving his A. M. degree from the
University in 1904. From the time she
began teaching until his retirement
last year he was a faithful worker for
the building up of the school. He was
one of the most popular instructors in
the faculty. His wit appealed to the
students and he was looked upon -as a-
companion rather than a teacher. His
methods of teaching were such‘ that
students enjoyed attending his classes.’-
By means of hislthousands of funny
stories he woul-ddrive his lessons ‘to
the heart of the student, never to be
forgotten. ‘

Professor Berger was veny well read
on reform movements and ot-hen grlelat

e
divulged much interesting information

which practically corresponds to the
A.Tmeri—can ‘college. He frequently com-
pared conditions as they exist in‘ Ger-
m’any;wit1‘h the conditions here and it
was these things particularly that ap-
pealed to the students. This made the
classes bothinteresting and instruc-
tive. " .

It was with deep. regret that the
death of Professor Berger was learned
by the students and faculty as his
many friends -‘had hoped that he would’
soon return to‘ the University and take
up active Work again. The funeral
was ‘held yesterday and the body’ taken
to.Iowa fon interment. Pro-fess-or Berg-
er was an activeimember of ghe Ger-
man Club and the Central Turn Verein.
«His widow and three daughters, who
reside on Atwood street, survive.
