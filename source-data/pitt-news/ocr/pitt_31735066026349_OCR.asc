Nearly six years after he filed
a lawsuit against the University
of Pittsburgh, a former graduate
student won $220,750 in a dis-
crimination suit against the uni-
versity and the former chair of
the economics department.

Deman, who had come to the
university in 1983, worked as a

In the lawsuit, Deman said the

other locations,” said
Moorehead.

The dorms that are
receiving the most atten-

the Towers.

“There is a lack of
dryers in the Towers,
and there is a lack of
dryers in Amos Hall,”
said Moorehead.

However, nothing has
been solidified as of yet.

“Nofpromises have
been made, no proposals

If you get a phone call from
somebody who says he is
from a Pittsburgh department
store saying you have won a
contest, don’t quit school just
yet.

According to Public Safety,
Pitt students living in the res-
idence halls have been
receiving prank phone calls
from someone who claims to
be from a local department
store. The caller tells the vic-
tim she has won a gift certifi-
cate and begins to asks her
questions about her clothing
size.

“After that, he asks her
about the woman’s undergar-
ments, which leads to ques-
tions of a sexual nature,” said
Rick Boyd, Director of
Public Safety.

Boyd said several of these
types of phone calls were
reported over the weekend.

In addition to those calls,
Public Safety has reported a
similar call in which the vic-
tim‘ is told to go to a certain
place to pick up a “prize.”
Boyd said there is a possibili-
ty that these calls are bait for
a robbery. ,

Boyd said he is urging Pitt
students to take caution when

receiving these types of calls. ‘

“I would encourage any
student who gets a phone call
like these to ask for the
caller’s name and number
and call the person back,”
Boyd said.

The Student Environmental
Action Coalition will be hold-
ing a Recycling Week begin-
ning next Monday and will
have recycling booths set up
in front of the William Pitt
Union and Schenley Quad.

The goal is to increase the
amount of recycling on cam-
pus and to make people aware
of the recycling process.

“There are a number of
loopholes thatneed to be
filled in,” said SGB member
Julie Clouse. “There’s a prob-
lem with education. The stu-
dents do not know that if they
throw one piece of candy
wrapper in the recycling bin,
then that whole bin is contam-
inated.”

SGB is also working on a
program with the Department
of Parking and Transportation
that will allow Pitt students to
ride Port Authority Transit
buses from campus to Squirrel
Hill or Shadyside. This pro-
gram is slated to begin on
May 1st of this year.

There will be no extra fee
added to students’ tuition, but
rather the transportation fee
will be given to PAT.

“We’re still paying a trans-
portation fee, except not to
use PAT. The tuition will not
rise by any means,” said SGB
President Julie Crowell.

benefit the Oakland area by
increasing accessibility and
reducing congestion, but some
were not quite so optimistic

about the realities of its exis-

tence.

“Twenty years from now,
your Spine Line isn’t going to
work,” quipped 70-year-old
Oakland native Bob Casciato.

Spine Line will be funded by
federal money, and according
to a new federal law named
ISTEA, (Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act)
coordinators are required to
involve the public in the local
area. The public involvement
will entail discussing project
goals and objectives and assist
in generating alternatives for
consideration in the study.

Some residents said they are
in favor of the Spine Line, but
the current plans to utilize
Camegie-Mellon University as
a last stop on the route would
increase area parking prob-
lems.

Residents’ suggestions for

“ alternative

transportation
ranged from creating bike
paths and carpool lanes along
the “highway” of Fifth Avenue
to constructing underground
busways and roads for buses
only atop already existing
roadways. Officials from PAT
and SPRPC were eager to
work with -the residents and
would take their suggestions
under advising and try to uti-
lize them in the ﬁnal planning,
they said.

But Oakland resident and
engineer David Nayberg
claimed that the scoping meet-
ings weren’t really meant to
hear the ideas of the people.
“We’re here because federal
mandate requires people to be
present here at‘me'etings.like
these,” he said.

“I want you to be very care-
ful about public money,” he
explained. “This is not honest
money  without private
involvement, it can’t be done.”

Nayberg suggested that PAT
be dismantled immediately and
replaced with private services.

comment on Deman’s state-
ments.

Deman filed a grievance
against Sontheimer in July
1987.

“Since then, he made my life
very difficult,” said Deman.
“After I filed the grievance, he
chased me down the hall and
screamed at me. He threw me
out of his office and removed
my mailbox.”

Around this time, Deman
started an informal, satirical
newsletter for the economics
department titled “News
Views.” Among other topics
discussed in the newsletter was
the grievance Deman had filed

against Sontheimer.

_“[Sontheimer] was upset
about this-,” Deman said. On one
occasion, Deman said he wit-
nessed the chair taking the
newsletters out of the faculty
mailboxes and throwing them
away.

In January 1988, Deman had a
three—day hearing with the
Student Judicial Board dis-
cussing the newsletter and dis-
ruptions in the economic depart-
ment. As a result of the hearing,
Deman was removed from the
university, and in November he
ﬁled a complaint.

Under Title VII of the
Pennsylvania Civil Rights Act,
Deman sued the school and
Sontheimer for back pay and
compensation.

The jury awarded Deman

$20,750 in back pay and»

$200,000 in compensatory dam-
ages.‘ ‘ t 1 '

“I think the [jury] has sent a
clear message to the university
and the ivy tower professors,”
Deman said. “If you’re a victim
of racial discrimination or sexu-
al discrimination, you should go
to court.”

In a letter to the India-
America Society of the United
States, from Lewis Popper, gen-
eral counsel for the university, it
was stated that Deman received
a fair hearing by the student
judicial system. “Following an
investigation and formal hearing
by his peers in accordance with
our student judicial procedures,
Mr. Deman received a fair hear-
ing with full due process.”

Popper also wrote, “the
University of Pittsburgh is proud
to welcome students from many
countries, including India, and
we treat them with the same
respect, consideration and finan-
cial support as American stu-
dents. We are conﬁdent that Mr.
Deman was treated fairly here.”

According to Service, the uni-
versity will petition the court to
set aside the verdict.

Buy the Bucs

The city has had its chance. It failed. Now, a Pittsburgh
institution is in grave danger, and Pitt students can help.

As of yesterday, the city of Pittsburgh had failed to find a
buyer for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Now the owners are free to
sell to anyone they see fit. The team can now be moved to
another city.

This travesty must not be allowed to happen! To lose the
Bucs would be a great loss. Despite the seemingly endless
strike, this city needs baseball. It is imperative now more
than ever. The Pirates represent a chance to recoup to city’s
lost honor after it was stolenthis year. Will Pittsburgh be a
city of no prowess? .

By queer coincidence, five years ago yesterday, someone
stole the Pirate Parrot costume, according to The Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. A suit worth $8,200 was stolen from a car. It is
odd that five years later, the city has left the possibility open
for someone to make off with the Pirates themselves. Not
only will the Pirates go, but so will the capital their games
bring in.

The question now is, “What do we do?” Well, The Pitt
News is sponsoring a “Your Bucks to Save the Bucs” fund-
raiser.

The only real option is for the students here at Pitt to show
their support for the fine city of Pittsburgh by buying the
Bucs. This way, the University of Pittsburgh doesn’t look
like it is full of a bunch of bourgeois kids from outlying
areaslabusing the city by electing Rick Santorum.

Before anyone protests the impossibility of this plan, it
would be nothing new. Carnegie-Mellon University already
owns $2.1 million in team stock.

If Pitt can follow their lead on computer bulletin board
censorship, there’s no reason that Pitt ought not support
Pittsburgh pride by keeping the home team at home.

Out-of-state students should also make a contribution to
The Pitt News’ “Buy the Bucs” effort. Pittsburgh is your
home away from home, and you should make your contribu-
tion so you can develop increased goodwill toward your
presence. 9

The price is onlyaround $90 million dollars. iWith all the
capital ﬂoating around this university, it doesn’t ‘seem like it
ought to be that hard to raise. If we could get a few people to
forgo the laundry for a couple of weeks and convince the
current owners to accept blocks, the money would be raised
in no time.

Mayor Murphy was quoted in the Post-Gazette as saying
that he didn’t think that the current owners would sell the

Pirates to the highest bidder to someone who would move _

the Bucs. Yet, how can anyone trust the mayor’s intuition?
He is a politician, a statesman of the city government at best,
but he is no psychic. There is little time to lose. Predators
from the Sunbelt are looking for a team.

blah,,blah, blah.

The Towers steps?

Two weeks ago, David
Orsborn, a person who sees
the same union, the same
cathedral, the same Oakland
streets and the same Towers
that you see every day, also
saw someone’s fist torpedo
into his stomach, saw some-
one’s wrecking ball shoe
crash into his-face, saw his
blood, red, warm and almost
alive, spilled outside of his
skin on some frigid, utilitari-
an stone steps.

The Pitt News commended
those who fulfilled their
civic duties by providing
information that led to the
arrest of the five suspects.

In this case, these duties _

asked only that the witnesses
sit back, accept a blatant
injustice, watch a classmate’s
head bounce off cold, hard
granite, witness a case of
“ethnic intimidation” spatter
Dr. Martin Luther King’s
honor with yet more blood a
few days before his own
memorial and eventually, far
after the fact, notify the
authorities who are paid to
deal with these situations.
Fortunately, because some-

, one eventually got help,

Orsborn is alive. However,
this does nothing to ease the
shock that many people sim-
ply walked by, even walked
around the brutal beating and
simply let it happen.

People tried not to notice,
just like we all try to avoid
eye contact when we walk
down the street.

A university as large as
Pitt allows us to be as inde-
pendent and anonymous as
we want to be.

It also can leave us isolated
to the point that we don’t

bother ‘each other, don’t care
about each other, try as hard
as possible not to notice each
other.

The Pitt News editorial
staff brought up a good point
when it wrote about the lack
of community at this univer-

sity that makes aloofness and ‘

indifference more than sec-
ond—hand; it is truly the only
acceptable behavior.

How has coldness become
so convenient? When did it
become a social taboo to
help somebody out? As-a
university, have we earned
our reputation for being"apa-
thetic? It’s very difficult to
think otherwise when we can
look away from ‘an act so
senseless, so infuriating’ and
so stoppable, and then let it
go by without a loud outcry.
Instead, we have Leon Haley
patting us_on the head telling
us there is no need to panic,
nothing to see here, you can
all go home.

The fact that we let the
violence happen is a cruel
fact that we cannot tolerate.
My purpose is not to invoke
the legislative socio-political
gods of public policy, nor is
it to explore the psychologi-
cal roots of violence.

But in a day and age when
we all live in either resentful
fear of violence or blind
naiveté, I find it completely
unacceptable that we can let
these things go on in front of
our faces without doing a
thing to stop it.

In the best ofiall possible
worlds, we would try to
break up any fight as crimi-
nally uneven as five to one.
However, I can understand
why people would shy from
the possible danger involved.
But what about getting a
large group together to
intimidate the offenders?

What about yelling at them, »

getting them to stop for a
split second, maybe distract-
ing them, maybe drawing
some attention to the situa-
tion, maybe saving David
Orsborn from a near coma?
At the very absolute least
lies ‘our duty to get to a
phone and tell the authori-
ties, not to saunter right by
an emergency call box
toward athousand more des-
t__ination's"with phones and
security personnel.

There is no excuse whatso-
ever in the world for not
demanding some level of
human decency from your-
self, if for no other reason
than the rather Machiavellian
concept that what comes
around goes around.

Unabashedly, I take the next

step to say that it is up to
you, and it is up to me and it
is up to every single person
you see in a day to demand
the same from others as well.
As one reputedly apathetic
Pitt student to another, I
challenge you to make that
demand and follow through,
but not just theoretically.
Not just in the best of all
possible worlds. I challenge
you to do something a little
odd, but nothing I haven’t
done myself.

Confront a total stranger
with this question: ‘‘If I were
50 feet away being beaten to
a bloody pulp, would you do
anything to help me?”

Make people think about
their fears and their apathy.
But I offer a word of caution:
stay in broad daylight on a

busy street right next to an .

emergency call box, and be
prepared to rely on yourself.

contract

t’s down-
right dis-
graceful
when a coach
has to egg the
crowd on to
cheen
That was the
case last
Wednesday
night when
Seton Hall
cruised into
the Fitzgerald Field House to
take on Pitt.

In the waning moments of
the game, coach Ralph
Willard, who’s in the first
‘stage of building the basket-
ball program into a national
powerhouse, had to turn to the
crowd and ﬂail his arms in the
air to pump some energy into
the fans’ lifeless limbs.

The crowd responded, half-
heartily, but it was too late.
Pirate guard Danny Hurley hit
the game-winning shot, and
the Panthers lost another game
by two points, 72-70'. This is
the same Danny Hurley who
was absolutely tortured by
fans two years ago when Pitt
upset the Hall.

Willard’s attempt to arouse
the crowd wasn’t done in a
towel—waving, jesting manner
-—- he was pissed off. And he
expressed it after the game.

What was equally frustrating
for Willard was that his No. l
recruit Vonteego Cummings
and another recruit making an
official visit were on hand to
witness the student apathy.

Willard’s job description
doesn’t entail being a cheer-
leader. That’s for those girls in

_skimpy outfits jumping up and

down when the other team
scores. -

Not even that fat man run-
ning up and down the sidelines
pumping his arms like a lobot-
omized gorilla could resurrect
the crowd.

Coming to the Field House
used to be hell for opposing
teams, but now it’s like play-
ing on a neutralcourt. The
bottom line is Pitt fans just
don’t care anymore. They have
been suffocated by the
Panthers 5-12 record.

The fans’ ambivalence
shouldn’t surprise anyone,
though. It’s inherent of
Pittsburgh. It’s inherent to sup-
port a winner and quickly hop
off the derailing train when a
team loses — i.e. the Pirates.
Pittsburgh is a pure football
and hockey city, and if the
other sports like basketball and
baseball fail, oh well.

And the bandwagon trend
will continue next year when
Willard gets his prized recruit-
ing class in, along with Jerry

At practice, he works as hard and sweats
as much as anyone else. During the game,
he can be seen peering intently into the
huddle, not wanting to miss a thing. When
things are going well for the team, he is the
first to congratulate the scholarship players
as they head for the bench.

Mike Wemicki is a walk-on, one of six
on this season’s Panther basketball roster.

Simply utter the word “wa1k—on,” and
chances are you will provoke a snicker. The
snicker is often followed by unfriendly
terms such as “bench-warmer,” “scrub” and
“nobody.”

But things are different this season. In
other programs, walk-ons may be “scrubs,”
but not at Pitt, at least not this year.

Ralph Willard’s Panthers have been
depleted by injuries, and players such as
Wernecki have become more of an asset
than a liability.

“Wa1k-ons like Mike are performing a
valuable service to thisprogram and this
school,” Willard said. -

In other words, the team would have a
tough time practicing with only seven
scholarship players.

But as recently as a year ago, Wemecki
actually was at most of Pitt’s practices —
but not as a player, as a manager.

In fact, he had been a manager since
1991, the year that he graduated from Erie
Cathedral Prep High School.

And although he had played point guard
in high school, he had never really been
considered a standout player. But he wanted
to stay close to the game, and felt that being
‘a manager wasthenext best thing to play-
mg.

But by his sophomore year, Wemicki was
tired of rebounding in practice and decided
that he wanted to be one the guys taking the
shots.

He decided to walk-on.

“I went through conditioning and started
practicing with the team,” he said. “I went
for about a week and half and they let me

The loss dropped the Panthers’ record to 4-8. Pitt con-

Women 's gymnastics falls 0 little short

By Ed Ziegerifuss
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s gymnas-
tics team may have lost the
meet, but the Lady Panthers
scored their highest team score
in a long time.

The final tally had the
University of New Hampshire
defeating Pitt by the score of
187.625 to 184.70.

“Super. Exciting,” head
coach Debbie Yohman said of
her team’s performance. “I’m
just really pleased.” .

In the all—around competi-
tion, UNH sophomore Jana
Reardon took top honors with
a total of 38.575. In second
was Pitt’s ‘Brenda Stevens
(37.875), who was named
ECAC Women’s Gymnast of
the Week for her performance
in the Lady Panthers’ home
opener two weeks ago. Fellow
Lady Panther Robyn Senior
(37.800) took third in the all-
around. .

“Brenda had a little bit of ‘a
rough time,” Yohman said,
“and she still placed second in
the all—around.”

Pitt started strong on its first
event, the vault. Senior (9.625)
led the way with Stevens
(9.35) and freshman Tracey
Brown (9.25) close behind.
Senior finished second in this
apparatus to UNH’s Reardon.
UNH freshman Jen Symecko
(9.425) placed third overall in
this event. Senior’s score was
the highest on the vault for Pitt
this season.

The second rotation of the
night led Pitt to the uneven
bars. Stevens (9.525) led the
way for her teammates by
winning the event. In second
and third were UNH senior
Amy Ehle (9.350) and
Reardon (9.325). Senior
(9.225) had the next best score
for Pitt on the bars.

“We were a little disappoint-
ing on bars,” Yohman said.
“Deena Daller will improve on
bars; that is a new skill for her.
Lori Buck needs to be more
aggressive. Joy McElhinny
just needs more difficulty. We
only have seven people on
bars, and we just need prac-
tice.”

Pitt’s next event was the bal-
ance beam, where the team
had its best performance of the
competition. All six of the
Lady Panthers had good rou-
tines. Once againleading the
way was Stevens (9.550).
Junior Deena Daller (9,450)
had her best beam perfor-
mance of the year as did Lori
Buck! (9.200). Freshman
Kristin Bond (9.325) also
scored her high of the season.
Other Pitt scores were Senior
(9.400) and Brown (8.950).

“It was probably the most
solid I have been all year,”
Buck said of her beam perfor-
mance. “Overall we stuck
together and came through‘.
We lost, but in a way we still
won because we got our team
best.” '

“Six for six on beam, you
can’t beat that,” Yohman said.

IN THE ARMY,

The last event of the evening
for Pitt was the floor exercise.

(Senior (9.550) placed first,

followed by Stevens (9.45),
Buck (9.325) and Daller
(9.275).

“Deena competed success-
fully, and Lori finally hit her
ﬂoor routine,” Yohman said.

Pitt set season-high scores in
every event. Vault (46.45),
bars (44.725), beam (46.925)
and floor (46.60). all con-
tributed to the team-high score
of the season.

“We got our highest score of
the year and we did really
good, especially on beam,” co-
captain Stevens said.

Pitt was missing the services
of Mikie Myers, Calli Bodnar
and Bethany Toellner, who are
all out because of injuries.

The next meet for the Lady
Panthers will be Feb. 3-4 at

the Cat Classic held at the 7

University of Missouri. Pitt
will join the likes of Auburn
University, Penn State,
University of Arizona and
Missouri for two days of com.-
petition. ‘

I “The competition at the Cat
Classic will impress the kids,”
Yohman said. “It will show
them what collegiate gymnas-
tics is like nationally. I think it
will be exciting for us. We are
going out there as the under-

dog.” *
The next home meet for
Pitt is Feb. 18 when the

Lady Panthers host In-
diana University of
Pennsylvania.’ ‘

Wemicki stayed on the team
as a manager and didn’t,even

bother trying out the following
year. It was a decision that still
perplexes him to this day.

“I don’t'know why I didn’t
give it a shot,” he said. “They
ended up taking two, Shaun

Koontz and Derek Jones.”

But this season, with the lack
of manpower, Wemicki didn’t
even have to try out.

how,” he said. “The assistants

where. That’s hot!

Take a Spring Break reality check. South Padre Island, Texas,
is the hottest Spring Break destination for many reasons.

The Island is a hot spot for student's offering exciting music,
a sea of watersports and legendary nightlife. It's even close
enough to give you a spicy taste of Mexico. But the Island’s
location makes it even hotter; it’s further south than any other it
major Spring Break destination in the United States. That’s right.

And that means tropical sunshine, white sand beaches, clear
blue water and more sun-drenched days than just about any-

Located on the tropical tip of Texas, South Padre Island is
convenient by car or by plane and only 25 miles from Mexico.

Kevin was declared ineligible,
Wemicki became more than a
practice body. He was asked to
join the team, four days before
the regular season.

The short notice was far from
a problem.

“It’s a life-long dream come
true,” he said. “I’m thankful
that they gave me the chance.”

And contrary to what people
may think, the walk-ons, at least
under coach Willard, are treated
the same as scholarship players.

“We play a lot of minutes in
practice,” he said. “Because of
our numbers this year, we have
to.”

“We couldn’t do what we do
as a team without guys like
Mike who play hard,” Willard
said. “He’s a good player in
practice, as are all of our walk-
ons.” I

And that is what is expected
from_a walk-on, intensity and
hustle. Minutes in a real game
are the exception, and hard
work is the norm. it

“I can’t ask for more because
I’m at the highest level,” he
said. “I’d like to get more min-
utes, but from my viewpoint,
I’m happy just being here.”

But talking to Wemecki, you
get the impression that he
would be playing basketball
somewhere whether he made
the team or not.

His name would be the deﬁn-
ition inscribed next to the words
“hoop fanatic.” He literally
lives and breathes basketball.

If he’s _not playing, he’s
watching. His summers are
even based around basketball as
he coaches at four camps —
three at Pitt and one at Rutgers.

It's pretty obvious what he
wants to do after graduation
next April.

“I want to coach,” he said. “I
like working with the kids at
camp. Coaching is definitely in
my future plans.”

But these days, he is more
than content being part of the
Pitt program, whether it be as a
player or a manager. Wemicki is
so committed that he passed up
a chance this year to transfer to
Division HI Penn State-Behrend
to play point guard.

He is content where he is
right now, as a walk-on, staying
close to the game he loves.

Column——

°From page 6 -

McCullough and Morgan State
transfer Gerald Jordan. The
same fans who sat glumly with
their fingers in their noses
while Pitt was about to lose
another close game will be
right in the middle of the Pitt
basketball hysteria.

But I got news for you all.
There’s a new trend spawning
on this campus — a winning
trend. So when Pitt hoops
starts to explode in Oakland
—-— stay home. There are plenty
of people who will want your
seats.
