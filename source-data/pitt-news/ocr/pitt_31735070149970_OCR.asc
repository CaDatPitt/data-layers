Pitt students use Spring Breaktotvolunteer across the country

The Alternative Spring Break program provides students with opportunity to take service trips;

By Parthena Moisiadis
For The Pitt News

Rachel Balog spent her sopho-
more year Spring Break working
on two homes in Newjersey.

“Waking up at 6 a.m.'to start
the day and- not getting home
until 5 p.m. was rough,”- the se-
nior accounting and communica-
tions.major said. ‘.‘I’dnever been
involved in building things. We
even had to do a lot of calculations
ourselves.”

For four days, she and 11 of
her peers helped‘Habitat for
Humanity ﬁnish drywalling the
Garden State homes for families
that could not afford to pay for
the servic-es.

“The homeowners were so
happy to see it all coming to-
gether,” she said.

In two weeks, 69 students will ‘

travel to four locations across
the country. to volunteer over
their Spring Breakslike Balog
did as part of Pitt’s Alternative
Break program -— service trips
organized annually through the
University’s Student Volunteer
Outreach.

“It wasn’t hard to give up
Spring Break. I wouldn’t be do-

ing anything anyway. It was a nice -

opportunity to give back instead
of‘ sitting at home and wasting
time,” she said.

This year, students can choose
between four locations, each of-
fering a different community
group with which to connect and

- volunteer: Habitat for'Humanity

in Delaware, Camp Sequanota in
Pennsylvania, Youth Service Op-

_ portunities Project in Washing-

ton, D.C., and Cumberland Trail

in Tennessee. The trips’ costs vary
from $200 to $450. , . _
While a majority of the spots

- have been taken, four openings

are still available for the trip to
Wilmington, _Del., and one slot is
open for the Tennessee trip. Stu-

dents can sign up for an Alterna-
tive Break trip by logging on to ‘

SVO’s website.

.“While Student Volunteer
Outreach‘ offers other-options
for students to volunteer time
throughout the year, Alternative
Spring Break is the only volunteer
project that involves travel and a
seven-day service experience,”
said Cathleen Connor, project co-
ordinator at S.VO. \ _‘ V

. Chris Schei, a volunteer co-
ordinator with Habitat for Hu-

manity in Delaware, said that Pitt .

students will help build 21 new
homes in the area under trained

supervision. 7
“They’re going to be installing
ﬂooring, painting the homes, put-
ting up siding and helping with
landscaping,” he said. "

Students going to Soddy-Daisy,
Tenn., will also encounter physi-
cal work when they clear and
extend the Cumberland Trail, a
1,75-mile—long hiking trail.‘ Pitt
students have volunteered at the
trail for the past 16 years, clearing

about one mileeach year._

In Washington, D.C., workers
will remain indoors with volun-
teer opportunities at a variety
of sites including soup kitchens,
drop-in shelters and homeless
prevention sites.

_, “The service is physical, men-_
tal and emotional,” said Shawn
Sendar, ' a YSOP staff member.

funding

By Michael Ringling
Staﬁ’ Writer

Members of the African Student
Organization showed up to de-
fend their allocations request

-‘ and gained some ground: trans-

portation, but no acrobats.

At Tuesday night’s Student
Government Board meeting, the
Board brought on a slew of new

information regarding its initia— .

tives, and it votedto fund more
than_hal~f of the ASO’s resubmit-
ted funding request for its fifth
annual Wazobia cultural event.

- The group came to the Board
requesting $6,160.42 to pay for
an honorarium, airfare", ground
transportation and lodging for
three designers that would con-
tribute to the fashion show por-
tion of the event. The group also
requested money for security for
the event, costumes and hono-
rarium for acrobats. ASO did not
request funding for the comedian
Don’t]ealous Me. _.

The Allocations Committee
initially recommended that the

- Board approve $3,560.42 ofthe

request and deny $2,600 for the
acrobats and ground transporta-
tion for the designers. The rec-
ommendation to deny. ground
transportation stemmed from a
lack of documentation, but ASO
was able to show documentation

‘during the Board’s discussion.

Board Member Halim Genus
moved to amend the request to
fund an additional $100 to cover
the cost of the transportation,

and the Board unanimously

appr.oved.the amendment. Ul-
timately, the Board approved

-$3,66o.42 and denied $2,500 -

for fees for acrobats. .
ASO_ withdrew the origina

$10,079.14 request for Wazobia

at thejan. 31 SGB meeting after the Board
raised concerns about documentation.

for two parts of the request: supplies the T

group intended to purchase from a thrift
store and the fee and travel funding for
the comedian.

The group wanted to bring to campus

' British comedian Don’t]ealous Me, who is

of Nigerian descent, along with a pair of
acrobats and three fashion designers for
different parts of the event. The group also
requested money for supplies its members
‘wanted to purchase from thrift stores.
Board members objected to part of the
request because of an email included in
the group’s paperwork. The email, sent to
Don’t Jealous Me, had a line blacked out.
But the line was still legible, Allocations
Committee Chair Michael Nites said. Ac-
cording to Nites, the email said the group
could not get money for Don’t]ealous Me’s
ﬂight and asked that the comedian quote

a new fee because he would have to pay
forthe ﬂight. _ —

Don’t Jealous Me wrote back with a
new, higher price. The group’s request
onjan. 31 did not include the cost of the
international flight as a separate line item,

but it did include the email exchangewith _

Don’t ]ealous Me.

ASO’s business manager, Inatimi
Oguara, latersaid that she had blacked
out a line in the email to Don’t Jealous

Me. Funding rules in the Board’s Alloca— _‘

tions Manual do. not allow SGB tofund
international flights: . l '

, _ The email was sent from the Wazo-
bia planning committee’s email account,
separate from ASO’s general account. Both
Oguara and ASO President Onaopemipo
Dina declined to identify the author of
the email. ’ ' . '

On the WPTS Campus Roundtable radio

show on Feb. '1, Dina said that six mem- 4

bers of the Wazobia planning committee
had access to that email account. Oguara
said that neither she nor Dina is on the
committee, which is separate from the
group’s leadership. A

Dina and Oguara will not identify" the '

mittee does not have a public website or

Board President James Landreneau,
Nites and Dina have all refused requests to
provide a copy of the email exchange with
the performer, redacted or otherwise.

At the Jan. 31 meeting, after discuss—.

ing the request, thegroup withdrew it to

‘make revisions.

On Tuesday night, ASO did not dis-
pute the funding for the acrobats until the
open ﬂoor_ segment of the meeting began.

Members of the organization questioned

the Allocations Committee’s reasoning for
denying the performers.

“Is there a reason why you guys do‘n’t..

think Africanacrobats would be a’good
asset to the show?” an ASO representa-
tive said. A ‘ .

. Allocations Committee Chair ‘Michael
Nites said that?"th'e committee “did provide
a signiﬁcant contribution to this event.”

Members -ofASO continued to. question

_ the Board and Nites" until SGB President B

James Landreneau asked the group to

“It just seems like it is back and forth.
It better be communicated  after the
meeting,” Landreneau said. “This is cer-

tainly not us saying there isn’t any value

in bringing acrobats.’-’
Three members of ASO denied to pro-
vide further comment after the meeting.
‘In other business, Board member Me-
gan McGrath announced that after spring
break, the William Pitt Union will be home
to a pilot.bike rentalprogram. The cost
of rentinga bike will be $3 for a single
hour, $2 for each additional hour and $10
for a day. '
“If it works really well, we can increase’
the system,” McGrath said about the popu-
larity of the rental system, which currently

loans out bikes from the Baierl Student

Recreation Center. . _
Board memberjulie Hallinan said’ that

she said. -

Students traveling to Camp Sequanota in
Jennerstown, Pa., will be involved in both
trail building and volunteering at the local
foodbank.

Out of the ﬁve non—traveling days, stu-
dents will spend four working with their

her Alternative Break experience.
“Your body is not used to the physical
labor. You’re ‘ready to relax,” she said.

Balog encourages all studentsto apply V.

to an Alternative Break trip.

“Everyone should try it at least once. It’s
so rewarding when you see the progress you
made. You just ‘helped someone become a
homeowner or built a trail that thousands
of people will walk on,” she said.

Schei shared a similar sentiment about

_ the beneﬁtsthat come- from volunteering

over Spring Break. _

“You’re not wearing a swimsuit, but
you’re also not shoveling every day and at

One of the toughest things to become I

in life is a success. When you think
of c successful people, what names

-come to mind?'Kim Kardashian,
Donald Trump, Larry the Cable Guy, i"

Randy from “American Idol,” Dale

H Earnhardt and Yasmine Bleeth, to‘
 a name a few. There might be others,
' i '  , butthis listwill suffice for now. What.

do these people all have in common,
aside from the fact that they’re so suc-

C€SSﬁ1l? We have absolutely no idea, ‘

but that won’t stop us from telling
you how to succeed.

First, you need to be aware of
the fact that most people are total

° failures. Even people who are°occa—
sionally successful fail a good part

of the time. We recall hearing some
old wives’ tales about how Babe Ruth

struck out every single time he didn’t
«hit a home run and how “Honest”

Abe Lincoln never won so much as a
game of video poker until he captured
the presidency in 1860 with aplural—

. l ity of the vote. In other words, don’t -
feel too bad _if you faﬂ, because you

probably will.

Now that we’ve got those pre-
liminaries out of the way, it’s time to
commence a rung-by—rLmg climb up
the ladder of success. The ﬁrst step to

‘becoming a success is thinking suc-

cessﬁil thoughts. Unless-you approach
your life with a successful mindset,
you won’t have a snowball’s chance‘

Here’s an example of how adopting
such a mindset can change the course
of your existence: '

_ You: Look, I’m not goingto accept .

that F. I clearly wrote an A+ paper, and
that’s what you’re going to give me.

-Your Professor: This is just a copy

of a Wikipedia article with your name .

written in pen at the top.

You: You’re making the mistake of

T a lifetime, bro. I’m a big success, and

you better not forget it.

Your Professor: Get out of my of-
ﬁcé!
See that? There’s a person who

' refused to give in, even when the odds

were at their longest. He just stayed

- true to his successful self and wound

up right back where he started: on
top. Of course, if you’re genuinely

successﬁil, you’ll never beanywhere
‘ but at the top. Nor will you take any-

thing short ofa “hellz yes!” for an
answer: _ -

u: hey dude why don’t you come
over tonite n we can rock out

urfriend: nah dawg I gots some
stuff 2 do .

u: sorry man but I don’t take no
for an answer

Your friend tried to weasel out of _

his obligation, but you stopped him
dead in his tracks — you’re a success,
and you’ll never kowtow to’ the likes of

- him. He’ll be over there rocking out
a game of ﬂip cup before you can say ,

“Snowpocalypse ’o9.”

Anotheraspectofbeingsuccess- if

ful is having a “thing.” Recall the list
presented earlier. Randy of “American
Idol” fame is best known for calling
contestants his “dawgs.” Larry the Ca-

ble Guy wears sleeveless ﬂannels and
urges his fans to “get ’er done.” Kim
Kardashian is Kim Kardashian. What
do you bring to the table, friends‘? If
the answerfis “nothing,” you’d better
ﬁgure out something tout de suite!

Try these possibilities on for size:

‘ a) The “Yo Mama” person. You
never fail to ﬁnd a way to tell incon-
gruous “yo mama” jokes:

Your Professor: Who won the elec-
tion of 1860? _

You: Yo mama’s so fat there’s a
bunch of dirty pictures of her on X-
rated Big Beautiful Women (“BBW”)
websites. _ ‘

Your Professor: Please leave the
room.

b) The “Donovan McNabb Eagles
No. sjersey” person. You’re never
seen without your trademark Dono-
van McNabb Eagles jersey:

Your friend: Brahski, that guy got
traded off the Eagles years ago! Why

are you still wearing that tired old

jersey? It’s got holes in it, and it smells
like a dirty gym sock. . '

You: I know, right? That’s my
thing. ‘

c) The “Internet ﬁrst” person. b

There isn’t a single video or article
on the entire Internet that you haven’t
laid your beautiful blue eyes on hours
before anyone else: '

‘urfriend: bro u seen this one killer
blake griffin dunk that happened six
secondsago‘? V ,

u: dude I already made an ani-
mated .gif mocking all the people
who were mocking the people who
were mocking the people who ﬁrst
uploaded it. and that was yesterday.

However, even with the right
mindsetandanunmistakable “thing,”
there are no guarantees that you’ll

succeed. If you do, though, it’ll prob— T

ably happen overnight and carry you
from rags to riches. It’ll be due to 130
percent perspiration and 18.5 percent
inspiration. It won’t just be the only

To the Editor,

From a conservative perspective, I’d

think that Mr. Mark Kozlowski, author of .

of getting that right nowlthan building

initiatives,. is a fair compromise".
Ninety-nine percent of American
women ages 15 to 44 who have had in-

tercourse have used a contraceptive
method. Thirty—one percent of women
who have had intercourse are infertile,
pregnant, abstinent, etc., and aren’t using
a method, but percentage—wise, almost
all of them are paying for a privilege that
they once enjoyed'and might enjoyagain.
At the average copay of $10 per month,
taken, as required, all 12 months, you

Given the large amount of people in those
institutions with different religious be-
liefs,'it is"a far greaterviolation of the

FOOTBALL 7

llhrystdiscusses

change,newyear

Paul Chrystnis spending his time building trust
iuith his players and evaluatingnew talent.‘

I By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor:

The Pitt football team spent" last
season shifting from a methodi-
cal, pro-style offense to a quick,
no-huddle style of play. This year,
the Panthers will have to adjust to
another new system:

9 New head coach Paul Chryst
— Pitt’s fourth head coach in just

5 more than a year — said his sys-

tem is similar to former Pitt head
coach Dave Wannstedt’s style of
play.»Chryst -— the former offen-
t sive coordinator at Wisc'onsin —_
runs a pro,-style offense, but has
been known to adjust the system
to hisplayers. .
~ “You never want the system
to be the thing that prevents you

from playing well,” Chryst said in -

a meeting with the media on Tues-
_day. “If you want to learn it, you
can learn it absolutely in a fairly

A short time. I believe_that, and_'I do

believe that we can teach it.”
Chrystsaid that many of the
concepts he uses carry over be-
tween systems, but there will be
new terminology for the players
‘to master.

“You are learning a new for-.

eign language,’_’ he said. “That’s
our job, to teach it. It’s also our job
to make sure we aren’t doing too

much and that guys know what -

they’re doing.” , '
Chryst served as Wisconsin’s

offensive coordinator for six '

seasons, and the Badgers accu-

mulateda 60-18 record during.

that time. The Badgersaveraged

.44.1 points per game and 469.9 '

yards per game under Chryst last
season. This season, Wisconsin

‘ broke the record for points per ,

game previously held by the
2010 team — also coordinated
by Chryst — that averaged 41.5
points per game.

— Two months ago, _Chryst took
over for Todd Graham, who bolted

for Arizona State with his high-oc- '

 

tane offense afterjust one season
as Pitt’s head coach. Since then,
Chryst has been working to build
relationships and trust with the
Pitt players.

“Your actions have to match
your words, and they have to do
it consistently over time,” Chryst
said. “You are just starting to build

' [relationships] right now‘. It’s not

like there’s a ﬁve-minute conver-
sation and there’s trust.”

Chryst said he’s ﬁnishing. up '

meeting with each player one-
on-one for about 20 minutes.

The ‘sessions aren’t used to talk»
about football, he said, but to get "

to know.the players as people.
“These last couple of weeks
I’ve enjoyed a lotbecause you get
to be with the players and you get
to be around them,” he said. “This
building isn’t a lot of fun without
the players  Each of these play-

~ ers has their own story and you
. start to get to know them and see

where they’re coming from.and
what makes them unique.’.’

Chryst said he’ll use spring
ball to determine the players’
capability on the ﬁeld. He said
he’s watched st_arting quarterback
Tino Sunseri ontape enough to
“get a feel for him,” but added that
he didn’t want to form too many
opinions yet about his play.

“You want to get a little sense
of who your team is and who they
are, but that’s what we’ve got
spring ball for,” Chrystsaid.

He said there will be open com— _

petition at every position because
the players are always comp et-
ing, but he added that players who
are well-established shouldn’t get
beat out.

“The great thing about sports
is what happens between the line

matters. Production matters, and ‘

playing the game well matters,”
Chryst said. “The best players

should be playing. If you were a ‘

starter and you are getting better,
then_'you probably still should be

Pitt and West Virginia l:'zicc offat the line ofTsci‘iii‘ini.>i

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

The West Virginia men’s basketball
teams 66-48 victory over Pitt Thurs-.
day marked the ﬁnal scheduled Big
East contest in Oakland between the
two schools. Across all sports, the

_Panthers and Mountaineers faced

each other more than 700 times
since the 19th century;

If you’re keeping track, West Vir-
ginia has the all—time edge in base-
ball, men’s and women’s basketball,
men’s and women’s soccer, tennis
and gymnastics. Pitt has bragging

rights in wrestling, volleyball and, c
x with the trump card, football.

As West Virginia abscorids to
the Big'12 and Pitt, eventually,» to
‘the Atlantic Coast Conference, the

Backyard Brawl’s many incarnations,

will now either fade in importance
or die altogether. But it’s hardly the
ﬁrst time Pitt has lost a rival.

Penn State football, of course,
"played the Panthers yearly from

-.1900 to 2000, outside of one De-

pression—era respite and aﬁve—year
break in the 1990s brought on by
conference realignment. The bas-
ketball rivalry survived until 2005,

with the 145th and ﬁnal game a Pitt «

blowout win at home in front of an
under-capacity crowd.
The schools still meet in smaller

. sports like volleyball, tennis and

The City Game against Duquesne
spanned both football and basket-
ball in the late 1930s. Pitt severed
the football relationship for good
in 1939, two weeks after the Dukes

beat the Panthers 21-13. The As— ,

sociated Press story from that day
stated the 1940 schedule would
still include “Nebraska, Penn State
and probably West Virginia,” which
was a one—sided rivalry at that point.
Pitt had won 11 in a row against the
’Mountaineers, and the Panthers
scheduled a game against Missouri
instead in 1940. l -;
The baseball City Game died in
2010 when Duquesne disbanded its
baseball program.’ '
. The basketball affair with the
‘Dukes, once intense enough to fea-

ture ﬁghts both on the courtfand _
in the stands, waned_ when the two 5

schools took different conference
paths,- just like the rivalry with Penn
State and soon with West Virginia. .
Once adversaries in the Eastern 8, in
1982 Duquesne stayed. in the newly
named Atlantic 10, and Pitt left for
the Big East, where it outgrew its
crosstown competition.

Notre Dame, an unlikely oppo-
nent to back out of a rivalry because
of uneven competition, did just that
after Pitt won at South Bend, 21-6,
in_ 1937. When the series resumed

"six years later, the Associated Press

story opened, “It took a world war
to do it, but Pitt and N otre Dame are

renewing one of the gridiron’s most

colorful series.” .

“It’s a one-year agreement, but
maybe extended,” Pitt athletic
director Jimmy Hagan said in the

article, channeling future noncom- '

mittal Penn State officials.

Pitt basketball had additional
rivals in the 1950s when the school
organized the Steel Bowl. A sold-
out tournament at the Fitzgerald
Field House, the Bowl grew popular
thanks to “the Panthers’ decision to
run the show as an elimination that

than merely show off four teams,”
according to an article in the Pitts-
burgh Press in 1953.

Panthers fall to No.4 llconn,
avoid another historic blowout

Pitt played a strong second half despite trailing by 38 points.

Byjasper Wilson
' Staﬂ” Writer

The outcome "of the Pitt women’s basketball
game against No. 4 Connecticut was never in

» question.

Pitt fell easily, 86-37.

-How Pitt would respond to the adversity ~

made for the story.
Inthe ﬁrst four minutes of play, Pitt had ﬁve
turnovers, allowing the Huskies to build their

advantage early. ' ‘ '
‘ « TheHuskies(25-3,12-3)weresharpearlyon,

despite coming off an upset loss at the hands
of St. john’s. ‘

“Obviously there is areasonthey’re lin] the -

top three in the country,” head coach Agnus
Berenato said. “Probably theworst time to play

- them is after an upset win.”

The score was tied once at 2-2 after Marquel

‘Davis made a jumper with 17:46 to go in the

ﬁrst half. From there, the Panthers (8-19, 0-14)
played catch up. .

' Brianna Kiesel weaved left and weaved right
as she desperately tried to lose her defender,

» who seemed attached at the hip. The scene was .

emblematic of UConn’s suffocation of Pitt in
the ﬁrsthalf. ~ ' ‘ '
“They jumped on us quickly,” Kiesel said.

_“We didn’t handle thepress as well as I thought

we could; but we did alright.” _‘

The loss was Pitt’s 13th straight, making’

the current stretch the worst in the program’s
history. . ' ' -
Previously, the worst league  the Pitt

‘women’s team has had in the Big East era was

a 1-5 record during the ’85—’86 season.

. The-10 points the_Panthers managed in the

ﬁrst half were the fewest a team has scored in
ahalf during Berenato’s tenure. '_ _
“Our conﬁdence was so blown away, there

was no sayingwewere goingto score 10 points‘

in the second half,” Berenato said.
Sophomore Asia Logan, after playing just

one minute in Pit-‘t’s last game, played four min— A
V utes and scored two points as she continues to

work her way back from a shoulder injury.
Freshman Kaleena'Mosqueda—Lewis had a
game—high 23’ points for UConn, while Tiffany
Hayes and Bria Hartley also ﬁnishedin double
ﬁgures, scoring 13 and 10 points, respectively.
The Panthers broke double digits on abasket
by Logan with 3:15 left to go before the break.
They wouldn’t score the rest of the half,
which ended 48-10. A I -

_ Pitt struggled to score for the entirety of th V
game, shooting just 24 percent from the ﬁeld,

barely managing to eclipse the team’s season‘
low of 23.7 percent.

The Panthers tied their season lowforpoints'

scored with 37, Which was also their ﬁnal tally

 1 againstHam_pt_on'intheirﬁrstgame ofthesea—

S011.

. ; had 10 points.

Despite the game moving out of reach early,
freshman walk-on Brianna Brizzi failed to see
the court.

In the second half, Kiesel took exception
to UConn’s,continued efforts offensively. After
a 3-pointer that made the score 61-16, Kiesel
looked over at the UConnbench and, with afew
words, let them know how she felt about it.

“He really took it easy on us,” Kiesel said.

“I thought Briwas tremendous inthe second
half,” Berenato said._ “She took on leadership

4 responsibility,” .

When UConn let,'up on the scoring in the

_second half, Kiesel visibly disagreed with the

notion, shaking her head.
“We could’ve been like Notre Dame and come
out here and run the score up, shot threes the

T whole game and try to get" 120,” UConn coach
Geno Auriemma said. “But that’s not the -

poin ” a
After evening the score at 2-2, Pitt went
nearly 11 and a halfminutes without scoring its
next ﬁeld goal. By that point, UConn‘had taken
»a stranglehold on the game, 31-8. To keep the

team from implodingfurther, Berenato irnple- V

mented a technique that the team used after
the Notre "Dame loss: Just forget about it, The
half was broken up into four—minute“quarters,
with Berenato updating the team on how itwas
doing duringtimeouts. .

“Coach B. saying don’t look at the score,

it really helped,” Kiesel said. “It may not have-

changed the outcome of the game, but it helped
our morale.” ._
The _approach seemed to have an effect, as
the score in the second halfwas not as lopsided
as inthe ﬁrst—l38~27 UConn. . A -
“Second half we responded better than the
_ﬁrst half,” Berenato said. “First half we were

shellshocked,weweredocile.Idon’tevenknow 6

who that was .”

_ The play of freshman point guard Kiesel’

was one of the few positives Pitt can take away
from Tuesday night’s drubbing. She led the team
with 15 points, all of which came in the second
half. Redshirt sophomore Ashlee Anderson

“Obviously, they beat us by a hefty amount,”
Kiesel said. “But we still played hard in the sec-
ond h .” ' '

The ever-present issue of turnovers reared
its ugly head once again, as Pitt committed 21.
But onapositive note, the team settled down in

the second half, givingthe ball away just7times.

after turning it over 14 times in the ﬁrst. 1
The pressure is now onthe Panthers to avoid

the distinction ofbeingthe ﬁrst Berenato team to

failto win at least two games in Big East play.

_ Eager to put the UConn game behind them,
the Panthers look toward their next game
against fellow cellar dweller Seton Hall —— who
also‘hasn’t won a game in the Big East —— on

S_aturday. It is the te‘am’s last home game ofthe

season. I

a starter.”

Chryst said he’ll hopefully ﬁll the quar-

terbacks coach and running backs coach po-
sitions soon. Pitt lost offensive coordinator
Bob Bostad to the Tampa Bay°Buccaneers
and running backs coach Eddie Faulkner

’ .to Wisconsin.

Joe Rudolph, originally hired as the
quarterbacks coach, was named the offen-
sive coordinator and the tight ends coach.
Previous tight ends coachjim Hueber will
now focus on the offensive line.

Chryst said he knew that Bostad “wanted ’

to go big picture” but that he didn’t know
when that chance would arise. Hueber and
Rudolph served as a contingency plan in
case Bostad received another offer.

“You knew that, at some point, Bob was
going to havesome opportunities,” Chryst
said. “You do absolutely plan_and have con-
tingencies. You got good coaches that can
coach different spots, that helps.”

He has-n’t made any decisions on which
coach will call the offensive plays, although
he said he’s planning on being involved and
joked that t_here’_s some plays he’ll always
call: the goodvones. ‘ ' 1

Bowl?” the Pittsburgh Press asked. Within

19 years, the Steel Bowl ﬁzzled, schools like
Bradley ‘and Geneva became afterthoughts,
and the City Game grew.

Pitt also used to battle Carnegie Tech, later
renamed Carnegie Mellon, in both football and
basketball. A crowd of 61,000 people watched
Tartan football beat the Panthers in 1938.

But eventually the Tartan athl"etic program
withered. By 1940, football coach Eddie Baker
openly predicted losses in a newspaper called
The Day. “At the. beginning of the season I

figured we’d win two games,” he said. “We

have won one, but right now‘-I can’t see where

The basketball programs typically played
each other once or twice per season through
the 1960s in a rivalry fostered by geography.
Pitt basketball has more’ wins against Car-
negie Mellon (106) than against any other
opponent. ,

The Panthers thumped the° Tartans, 118—_
84, on Feb. 6, 1971. Two days later, The N ews—

. Dispatch reported “Carnegie—Mellon officials
suggested the series with Pitt be dropped be-'

cause they felt they could not compete with
the Panthers, and Pitt officials agreed.”
