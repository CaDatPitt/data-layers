At a press conference Tuesday.
Dr. Ludmila Koehler discussed
the consequences of her belief
that “in dealing with Soviet auth-
orities one should be firm and
challenge them." The associate
professor of Slavic languages was
charged with “hooliganism" after
an anti-American solidarity rally
in the Soviet Union at the Solchi
International Youth Camp on Aug.

The Pitt professor and a group
of 29 students participating in a
study-travel seminar arrived at
the camp on Aug. 3. That evening
Dr. Koehler was invited to a meet-
ing of camp officials and present-
ed with a resolution that accused
America of "barbaric aggression
against the Vietnamese people"
and protested US policies “of ag-
gression in I-sraeli circles." The
resolution contained demands for
complete and unconditional with-
drawal from Indochinese and
Arab territories. Calling for con-
tinued “solidarity of the interna-
tional communist democratic
youth movement." the resolution

—,)stated that Israel was “using the

Campus Survey

Drug

(Editor's Note: Last April, Peter
Garrett, a student of the Graduate
School of Public Health, mailed a
seven page questionnaire to 1,595
full-time undergraduate students.
Many were personal questions
which dealt with religious beliefs,
political beliefs, and family, but the
core of the survey was student use
of drugs such as amphetamines,
marijuana, hashish, LSD, and more
common items such as aspirin, al-

. cohol, and caffeine. This fall, Gar-

ett has compiled the results of his
survey from a return of 65 per cent.)

same methods of mass annihila-
tion of civilian populations as did
German Fascism."

Dr. Koehler and her students
refused to sign the resolution but
decided to attend a solidarity ral-
ly the following evening; Camp of-
ficials allowed two American stu-
dents to speak. Numerous speech-
es characterizing the US as de-
lighting in the murders of inno-
cent Vietnames and Arab children
were presented at the rally. Be-
fore the American students spoke.
a Bulgarian official announced
that the resolution had been ac-
cepted by all but the Americans.
but that they did not wish to speak.

Rushing forward, Dr. Koehler
asserted that the American stu-
dents had previously been grant-
ed permission to speak and that
the Bulgarian’s remark was a
“typical Soviet lie.” A man grab-
bed Koehler and turned her
around, causing the microphone
to fall to the floor before she kick-
ed him in the shin. One of the
American students who Dr. Koeh-
ler described then as an “anar-
chist” asked her to translate his
comments into Russian for the as-

sembly. She agreed, but announc-
ed that the student’s propositions
were not her beliefs.

On Aug. 6. Dr. Koehler was
requested to pay for the micro-
phone that she allegedly destroy-
ed and was transported to a po-
lice station in Solchi. After being
informed that 19 persons had filed
complaints concerning her be-
havior. Dr. Koehler was charged
with ‘hooliganism.’ She was ask-
ed to leave the camp within 24
hours.

The following day. the students
left the camp and continued their
planned itinerary. Half an hour
later. Soviet officials took Dr.
Koehler to the Solchi airport
where she boarded a plane to Mos-
cow. Dr. Koehler admitted that
she was afraid after the students
had left. From Moscow. she took
a flight to Budapest where she
contacted the American Embassy.

The"Slavic professor stated that
she does not feel that the incident
will affect Pitts relations with
universities behind the Iron Cur-
tain and that she would not act
differently if confronted with the

same situation again.

Usage Probed  

at the University of Pittsburgh.
1.595 questionnaires were mail-
ed to a systematic sampling of
one-sixth of the full time under-
graduate students during the first
week of April. 1970. Almost 65
per cent of these were returned
anonymously. Results indicate
that approximately 30 per cent of
the students have had some ex-
perience in this area. More than
27 per cent of the sample admit-
ted to having used marijuana. in
addition. 21 per cent stated that
they had used hashish. These are
by far the two largest groups of
illicit drug users.

In all eight per ‘c_ent_said- that

they had used hallucinogens (mes-
caline. seven per cent; LSD. six
per cent! and two per cent admit-
ted to having had experience with
opiates.

Illegal barbiturate use totalled
five per cent. More than nine per
cent claimed to have used amphe-
tamines illegally by oral route;
only 0.6 per cent have ever taken
amphetamines intravenously.

In addition, 85 per cent have

used alcohol’ 69 per cent use. caf-
feine, 46 per cent use aspirin at

least on occasion, and 38 per cent

During the past few years new
lines of communication have
been established between the
University of Pittsburgh and
surrounding black communities.

The University» has been arous-
ed. and in its awakening. has
realized the necessity of con-
structing a concrete rapport with
the black people of Pittsburgh.

Through the persuasive efforts
of various groups and individ-
uals. a substantial number of
worthwhile. vital organizations
and programs have come into
being.

The University had been re-
peatedly condemned for existing
as an isolationistic institution.
unaware. intentionally or other-
wise. of the deplorable,educa-
tional. economical. and social
conditions in a number of the
black communities of Pitts-
burgh.

A large contingent of people
outside the University joined
hands with students and faculty
members in lambasting Pitt for
shirking from its responsibility.
Various present administrators
have voiced the opinion that Pitt
shied from making any commit-
ments for fear of jeopardizing
existing educational activities.

The needs of the black com-
munity have stopped falling on
deaf ears. Organizations such as
the University Community for
Educational Projects IUCEP) and
the Office of Urban and Com-
munity Services were planned
and established to discover what
the needs were and to subse-
quently attempt to meet them.
either by utilizing existing Uni-
versity programs or by establish-
ing new ones.

The University prudently ap-
pointed black men to head many
of the programs. including Dr.
Lloyd Bell. Director of Urban
and Community Services and Dr.
Edward J. Barnes. director of
UCEP.

Dr. Bell emphasizes the im-
portance of citizen participation
if a strong alliance is to be
maintained between the black
community and the University.
To term the functions of his of-
fice a“',mixed bag" would be
an understatement.

Established in June of 1969,
the Office of Urban and Com-
munity Services has helped the
Model Cities program in Oak-
land and the Hill plan an edu-
cation program and assisted the
United Black Front in the ‘plan-
ning of an economic develop-
ment program in the Hill. There
is hope in the future of provid-
ing a program of free musical
concerts in the Hill. ‘

Dr. Bells office is currently
working on a projection.for this
year and attempting a total as-
sessment of services available
within the University. Last year,
Dr. Bell made known his desire

DR. BARNES

to see the University sign con-
tracts with minority businesses
from the area and add people
from minority groups to the
Board of Trustees.

His office comes under the
auspicies of Program Develop-
ment and Public Affairs, head-
ed by Vice Chancellor A.C.
Van Dusen. Here. close rela-
tions maintained with the state,
of Pennsylvania and the national
government supplement the ef-
forts of local agencies.

According to a spokesman in
Dr. Van Dusen’s office, “We

try to keep abreast of existing

programs and the areas in which
monies could be made available
. . . . The school is informed and
is then able to take advantage
of contacts in Washington.”

Similar relationships exist on
the State level to facilitate com-
munications between the State
and the University. and locally
so that the University can be

interpreted to the community
and vice versa.

The Trees Hall Community
Leisure Learn Program was

formed by Program Development
and Public Affairs to provide the
people of the city with more ex-
tensive recreational facilities
and instruction. The program
serves mainly the Hill District
and South Oakland and offers in-
struction in swimming and
life—saving along with special
interest classes in areas such as
fencing and chess. There are two
qualified instructors in the gym
during the operating hours of
the program. '

there are presently three major

In this capacity. UCEP has been
able to bring approximately 250

been broadened and academic

There is a seven week orien-
tation session incorporated in
program consist-
ing of reading and study skills
and courses in minority group
history. Student under the De-
velopmental Scholars Program
are provided with a one year
transitional program where the
student has three classes per term
taught by UCEP people and two
chosen electives. Thus. at the
end of two terms. the student
has enough credits to be a soph-
omore.

UCEP's third project. the New
Careers Education Program.
founded only last January. is
designed to afford people ‘who
are already acting in a profes-
sional‘ capacity to become fully
qualified professional people.
Credit is given for work and life
experience and then supplemen-
ted with academic credits from
the University to enable the par-
ticipants to attain a degree later
in life without having to fulfill
all the requirements of the young
and inexperienced student. .

Mrs. Caryl Kline. director of
Continuing Education for Wo-
men. has developed a program to
help woman continue their edu-
cation of the university level.
Due to the effor-ts of Mrs. Kline.
there has been an increase in
the number of black teachers in
the city schools ‘-— black women
granted ‘scholarships through
this program.

It is crucial that there be un-
derstanding between and among
the ‘University and the black
communities of Pittsburgh. Now
that this barrier has been crack-
ed. many of these organizations
have as their main objective the
problem of deciding how the
University can participate ef-
fectively.

On Degree Proposal  

(Editor's Note: The following is a letter sent to the Pitt News by Dr.
Jerry Schneewind, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.)

The College of Arts and Sciences is considering a proposal to es-
tablish a new four-year undergraduate degree program. The program
would result in a degree tentatively called "Bachelor of Philosophy." It
is intended for students who wish to acquire a general education with-
out the specialization required in departmental major or pre-profes-
sional programs. While distribution requirements might be maintained
for these students. the requirement that each student must have a ma-
jor would be dropped.

The Council feels that more information is needed before a sen-
sible decision can be made and has asked me to try to obtain some idea
of student opinion about this proposal.

I would. therefore. like to request CAS students who have any opin-’
ions on this matter to let me have them. either in writing or in conver-
sation. as soon as is convenient. We would welcome your views as to the
value of such a degree and the extent to which students would be likely
to work for it rather than for the traditional BS. or B.A.. suggestions
as to an appropriate name. and ideas as to specific requirements for
the degree. We would be interested in knowing whether you think the
institution of such a degree would have any noticeable effect on college
teaching or on student attitudes in general.

It has been suggested. moreover. that if a general bachelor's de-
gree is instituted. it might be desirable to set more rigorous require-
ments for the traditional B.A. and B.S. degrees than we now have. and
we would welcome your reactions to this suggestion as well.

We will try to publicize the dates of CAS Council meetings at which
this proposal is discussed. Action by the full FAS is of course necessary
before the recommendation could be submitted to the Chancellor.

The latest use of the University
endowment fund has been the re-
cent purchase of controlling stock
in the 312-unit Penn Plaza
Apartments in East Liberty. Da-
vid M. Smith. University treas-
urer. announced Sept. 9 that there
are no plans to change the present
management and operation of
these new apartment complexes.
and that they will remain com-
mercial property.

There are not plans underway.
at present. to convert the apart-
ments into dormitories. There is.
however. to be a tie-in with Rus-
kin Apartments which will keep
track of vacancies. making this

versity people will be given pref-
erence on available apartments.
they will be treated as regular
tenants and with the same rental
rates as anyone else.

Mr. Smith strongly emphasized
that the money designated by don-
ors for the endowment fund must
be used only for the acquisition of
stocks. bonds. or mortgages. and
never for other University opera-
tions. Profit as a result of these
investments is bound legally to
be used according to the donors
desires. such as allocation for a
particular University department.

Smith stated that although
there is around $80 million in the
endowment fund at present. there

have never smoked cigarettes (31
per cent are current smokers).

Certain characteristics to illi-
cit drug users differ markedly
from those of the entire sample.
Although distribution of age and
college class among drug users is
about equal to that of the sample.
freshmen are about five times as
likely as seniors to have begun use
before entering college.

In addition, drug users are
more apt to be majoring in liber-
al arts and are less likely to ma-
jor in the sciences than are non-
users. Drug users tend to be male.
living away from home. uninter-
ested in religion and athletics.
but interested in politics.

Of religious groups, more Jew-
ish students than Catholic or Pro-
testant students were drug users.

Drug users are more likely to
predict revolution occuring in this
country within their lifetime. and
come from families whose in-
comes exceed $20.000 per year.
Their fathers are more likely to
hold white collar jobs or be self-
employed. and are less likely to
be employed as laborers.

Persons who do use drugs were
overwhelmingly (97 per centi in
favor of the lessening or the elim-

ination of harsh marijuana laws. E

although 66 per cent of non-users
felt similarly.

“Damn flimsy machines," said the attache.
“What?” asked the ambassador.

“I say, that in such a machine, the coin you put in has to break
an electronic beam, to open the door.”

The door snapped back suddenly. pinching the fingers ofithe at- ’
tache. He pulled out the ambassador‘-s sandwich with the hand not
bleeding.

“What about you," asked the ambassador. “Are you not having
a sandwich?“ ’ '

“No,“ said the attache evenly, “I'll just have a coke."

The attache approached the coke machine and put in a dime. He
glanced back at the ambassador, who was struggling to get the cello-
phane wrapper off the sandwich.

He pressed the coke button. Nothing happened. Then he noted
the label announcing the new 15¢ price of the soft drink. He flipped in
another nickel and pressed the button. Taking his coke out of the ma-
chine he saw it was only two-thirds full.

He pretended to take a swig before turning to face the ambas-
sador.

“A-hhhh,” he said turning round and placing the cup on the

A table. Then the both of them using all their might. managed to rip

the wrapper off the sandwich.

“I guess I’m not as young as I used to be,” the ambassador
muttered.

“What was that?“ said the attache.

“I said stavguess novung ustubi" and he then took a bite out of
his sandwich chewing heartily.

Ten minutes later he managed to swallow. and the attache
seized the opportunity to suggest they visit the embassy kitchen be-
fore going on to Trees Hall. '

The together cat. stepped back
a couple of steps——poked out his
chest—cleared his throat. and
said. “Why what. man?"

"Why do you look like you do-

things that you do.“ was the
strangers reply.

AND the together cat got real

quiet. He started worrying. and ’

for a moment thought he was go-

For the first time in along time
he could feel that he was doing
very untogether things. and he
didn't know how to cope with it.

He started to think. "I guess
I'm the way I am because it's

he said very slowly as though
he had come across some pro-

Okay. so it was a fairly sim-

  Violence;4The Tried  
  And True Answer?  

(Editor's Note: The following is the first install-
ment of Person to Person: In Place of Alienation. Stu-
dent Blasi, with a past background of pacifism,
writes that he has attempted to distribute his thesis
to the members of the Public Safety Department, and
other branches of city government, local peace
groups, community media, universities and other
persons and organizations “that have it within their
scope to make a directed response." He invites com-
ment.) A

' -by JOSEPH BLASI

“A climate of war creates its own horizons, its
own justification and method. Subjected to such an
atmosphere for a long period of time, men come to
accept it as normal and self-evident; they create
tools of violence as entirely normal methods of deal-
ing with ‘the enemy’; once created, the tools are
used with ever-increasing ease. Peaceableness, com-
munication with others, public candor—-these are
less and less trusted as methods of dealing with hu-
man differences. . . . In such an atmosphere, men
come to accept a totally different version of human
life.”

“Such men live in the dream world of the schi-

‘told and ‘the adolescent. .  The stronger becomes

lhe enemy. The enemy is everywhere. And almost

inevitably, as the complexities ofhuman relcition- I

ships merge into the single image of the enemy, a
complementary image of ourselves arises. We be-
come the beleaguered defenders of all that is good
and noble in life, the society whose interventions
are always governed by superior wisdom,.whose
military might serves only the good of huinanity."
(Daniel Berrigan, S..I., from The Call Us. Dead Men.)

It would be good for us as dissenters. public
and police to reflect how this logic has been our
own. how the ease of name-calling. taunting. club-

swinging. and rock throwing has been our inhu-

man luxury: Communists. pigs. bums. radicals.
fascists. police state. wrecked country . . . . .

Following are some impressions of our efforts
to communicate. Look closely at the faces!
SOME USUAL TACTICS

I With great ease. we deal with each other in a
way that canbe called eroding. \All have engaged

in. violence. and diversionary t3Cl’.lCS some more“.

have a number of things in common: we don't talk
to each other. we yell; we don't look at each other;
we don’t touch each other. we hit. we brush; we



bury feelings until they explode: we stay far away I

from each other: we line up against each other.
we don't walk around; we crowd together and

anger each other: we‘ve overawed with the poten-

tial and the real power we see. we have felt it.rwe
have used it. it hurts. it kills. ‘

The public is wont to blame violence on anyone
that it wishes. The media tries to illustrate our
confrontations in color. The dissenting citizens
may sometimes limit the freedom of others, burn
taunt and rip down. As the executive director of
the Ohio American Civil Liberties Union puts it:

"We have repeatedly pointed outthat the ex-
cessive use of naked power not only breeds dis-
respect for the law and institutions of our socie-
ty. but its ready availability and deployment pro-
moted the easy abuse of the force."

SELL-INDULGENCE
Edward Kennedy rounds out the score by say-
ing that “violence is an act of self-indulgence and

an admission of the lack of power." Certainly. it’

will be very dreary if we spend the rest of our lives
fighting each other.

As unfortunate as it may seem. amidst fierce
calls for police restraint and non-violent marches.
whatever peace occurs is not wholly based on our
friendly relations.

The enemy is still everywhere. It is still fash-
ionable for the dissenting citizens to hear: “The
day will come when there will be enough of us . . .
they can sit back and know its coming": and for
our Tactical Police Force-the name is even fear-
ful and illustrates how it sees itse1f—to be consi-
dered as men who have a job to do and know ho
to do it.“ »

Some of the latest tactics. though better than
pitched battles. are not tooimpressive: "Let's
show them we can be nonviolent.“ “Don‘t hit them

if they call you a pig." “Don't retaliate when the“

people stare and spit at you." "Let's move to the

 

streets." “You get on the sidewalk now or-you're .

not/going anywhere." , .

Down below the massive edifice of the Cathe-_

dral. in a now converted gym. some carpenters. a
lighting expert perhaps. and some very creative
and imaginative people have constructed an impres-
sive little theatre.

There is no stage with structure. its flexible like
the structure of theatre itself. It can be thrust out
almost to your feet . . . or up high and far away.

A personality exists there . . . happiness may or
may not be. a war may take place. a love affair may
unfold. So many things can happen there. so many
new things to learn . . . to be told.

TREAT IN STORE

Local theatre in Pittsburgh. for the most part.
isn't always the best. but once you've worked in
theatre you come to expect to find this as you move
frorr place to place. There is. however. at the Uni-
versity quite a treat in store for anyone with a dol-
lar. and a free Friday or Saturday night.

It. of course. all depends on how selective you
are, how much of a chance you want to take and to
what extent you’ll go to have a good time. Of course.
selectivity always means a little trust. a little inter-
est. and faith.

Geared to train and to entertain. the Studio The-
atre is a place where undergrad students. under the
watchful eye of professional grads and some expert
members of the drama staff experiment with new
forms. seek out new methods. and work with a vari-
ety of medias.

The Studio Theatre, in short. can be an exciting
experience. Whether you enjoy musicals. or cow-
boys. or even belly dancers at Joe‘s Bar. you owe it
to yourself. if only once to step aside and try it.

Whether the play flops are wins. its worth the
buck to get in. I've never heard of some of them
either . . . but that’s the fun in it. Don't be afraid to
experiment: something new may be all that is need-
ed to make a perfect evening.

The theatre hopes to be able to have a produc-
tion on Friday and Saturday evenings during most of
the semester. -

THE PROBLEM
The Studio Theatre opens its “70-71" season on
Sept. 11 with two one act plays entitled The Problem
and An Odyssey in Mime. The second production of
the season will be Genet’s The Maids to be present-
ed beginning Sept. 25. The former two works are be-
ing staged from last year and if reproduced as they
were then-—you should be in for a most enjoyable
evening in the theatre. '

A modern one-act farce. The Problem manages
to involve every current social. psychological and
political cliche as ‘seen in the unusual customs of a
young married couple.

Such topics as race relations miscegenation.
welfare. awareness. activism. lack of communica-
tion. marital apathy are all grist for a comic mill
that somehow inverts the traditional or accepted
meanings we give each of these concerns.

Audiences at the initial production of the work.
last winter. reacted strongly with laughter. occa-_
sionally in outrage. No one was without reaction.

INJUSTICE
Problem is a wildly funny farce around. among

other things. "social injustice" utilizing the “sex.

theme" with much imagination and a great deal of
humor. It deserves three rounds of applause.

Directed by Val Mayer. it was well staged, tim-
ing was precise in mostinstances and the talents of
Tom Spinella and Sandy Mandel were above and be-
yond the call of the amateur.

It is rumored that The Problem will be present-
ed at a later date.

An Odyssey in Mime is an original short work by
Sandy Berman. who has previously demonstrated
her considerable gifts in this field in the Studio The-
atre‘s production of Beckett's Act Without Words.
An allegorical study of man, An Odyssey in Mime
is a short musical work of considerable scope.

Both Problem and Mime will be presented Sept.
11. . 12. 18 and 19 at the Studio Theatre. A nominal
charge of $1 per ticket is made. Seating is limited
—-so if you plan to attend——get your tickets early !’

Next week: Previewing The Maids.

Later this afternoon (around
4:30). Panther Coach Carl De-
Pasqua expects to put his football
team through its final scrimmage
before next Saturdays opening
game against UCLA.

"It will be a controlled scrim-
mage." DePasqua explains, em-
phasizing the word "controlled."

Some degree of control seems
to be necessary. With the season
only a week away. the Panthers
can‘t afford to walk away from
this practice session with as
many bruises and strains as they
suffered in their earlier scrim-
mages. P

Right now, the gridders are in
the best physical shape they have
been since they broke camp at
Meadville two weeks ago. The
training rooms had been the busi-
est places after drills until very
recently. Yesterday the trainers
had one of their few “breathers”
concerning reports of injuries.

AD Didn’t Take ,

Seats From Us

Casimir Myslinski, Pitt’s Ath-
letic Director, has learned that
some students believe the stu-
dent seating at home football
games has been moved to sec-
tions closer to the end area of
Pitt Stadium, with last year’s
better student seats being sold
to paying fans. ‘

The information is only half- I

correct, he wishes to relate.‘The
student area was moved two sec-
tions closer to the end, but not
with the subtraction of any of
the old seats. Pitt students maynow
fill five sections, compared to the
former total of three.

' JERRY MYERS

Amid the panting and thud-
ding and the new faces that are
at the All-Purpose fields, the
giant, familiar frame of a form-
er Panther stand-out, and now an
assistant Freshman coach, Rod
Fedorchak, stands daily.

As a lineman for the Panthers,
Fedorchak battled opposing‘ de-
fensemen for three tough years;
three trying and rewarding
years.’ Suffering through the
humiliation and disappointment
of the last two of three succes-
sive 1-9 seasons, he was also an
integral part of the comeback
the Panthers exhibited in their
1969 campaign. It is due partly
to his efforts that the slogan
‘The Panther is back’ is justi-
fied.

When the pro-football draft
came around last spring, Fedor-
chak found himself on the draft-
pick list of the Kansas City
Chiefs, the reigning AFL-NFL
champions. Suddenly his whole
perspective changed, as he stood
on . the thresholp of his future.

Fedorchak says. “I had to
make a decision between foot-

ball andschool. I‘had been ac-,

cepted» to Pitt Denta1_;s_chool,and

Freshman Coach Bill Quinter
will bring some valuable reports
of another kind when he rejoins
his associates over the weekend.
He leaves today for Corvallis.
0re., site’ of tomorrow afternoon's
UCLA-Oregon State lidlifter.

Quinter will scout the Bruins
for his boss. DePasqua, bringing
the Panthers as up-to-date as pos-
sible with the Uclan strategy.

DePasqua hasn't exactly been
ignorant of the plans of UCLA
Coach Tommy Prothro, though.
With the aid of films and past ex-
perience, the Pitt coaches are

' able to set-up UCLA offensive

and defensive systems for their
players to work against in prac-
tice.

Quinters freshmen began leav-
ing their All-Purpose Fields drills
an hour early Tuesday so that
they could pretend to be the UCLA
Bruins in action against the var-
sity. ,

The frosh will continue the im-
personation until the varsity
meets UCLA next Saturday. De-
Pasqua wants his upperclassmen
to see the opposition's strategy as
often as possible, assuming that
they don’t learn much right away.

“Not at first,” the coach said,
“because the freshmen aren’t
used to everything they're suppos-
ed to do. And they’ve only been to-
gether a few days.”

But despitethe effort. the fresh-
man aren’t good look-alikes for
the UCLA players, particularly in
the uniforms the frosh wear.

Quinters group has been drill-
ing in the old Steeler uniforms, the
black ones with a huge gold stripe
covering the shoulders. A

think about. "

The gridder then landed a
job in the University Towers
as a‘ resident assistant. He still
had a strong desire to help the
school, “especially in the athle-
tic program.” The opening
was there and Fedorchak decid-
ed that the best way he could
help was as a coach.

Grad students have that oppor-
tunity. “he explained. “Now I'm
working with the line."

“Coaching gives me an oppor-
tunity to keep in touch with the
university. The boys them-
selves look good. And it’s my
job to keep up their initiative
and keep them working. "

The Cubs have been getting
more and more opportunities to
practice on the Astro-Turf.

Every day the Panthers are
practicing in a more attractive
environment. When they first

stepped onto their new AstroTurf ‘

Fields the contrast of the Turf's
bright green and the weather-
worn. grayness that covered the
wall surrounding the field was
quite a sight. The wall is slowly
nearing its completed paint job,
though, and the Blue and Gold
wall now is a more suitable circu-
ference for the AstroTurf and the
new Tartan Track.

There’s stilla chance to be-

fall football season—if you are

Tryouts were held last
spring, but there’s room for
one or two males, depending
on qualifications. The final
testing will occur Monday at
Trees Hall. '

Women’s Tennis Team

"Get the wordaround that a women's varsity tennis team exists.“
Dr. Goldie Edwards urged. In fact it has existed for two years.
during which Dr. Edwards has coached.

Dr. Edward. who received her B.S. in physical education at

New Zealand and her M.S. and
played tennis in the New Zea-

land Junior Development Pro-
gram. She has taught at Pitt for
eight years and last year defeat-
ed the US national squash cham-
pion. Currently. she ranks third
in the nation.

Her tennis team, consisting of
eight girls, faces some changes
this year. A budget has been
provided for a programmed
learning guide, transportation for
away tournaments, and meals af-
ter matches. However the girls’

Delts Win
ll-7 Over
Theta Chi

Despite a shaky seventh inn-
ing. Doug Kennedy hurled Delta
Tau Delta past Theta Chi. 11-7
to open the 1970 intramural soft-
ball season here at Pitt.

In Wednesdays opener good
play
was marred by several errors.

The Delts opened up a 4-0
lead in the very first inning. as
Kennedy. Ray Barnhart. and
Bob Lapore rapped run—scoring
singles.

Continuing their batting as-
sault throughout the game, the
Delts added three runs in the
bottom of the “sixth inning, with
two coming in on a titanic home
run by Jerry Nowak. However,
Theta Chi stormed back in the
top of the seventh, scoring six
runs. But Bob Wingard was
hung-up between third base and
home plate to help kill the up-
rising.

Dick Stought and Rick Bliss
paced Theta Chi with two hits
apiece.

Kappa ‘Sig Spoils
New Frat Debut

The fact that Kappa Sigma had
some of it's athletes absent be-
cause of class scheduling and
that they had had no practice
before game time didn't seem to
bother the Kappa Sigs’ very much
as they went on to defeat Delta
Sigma Chi, 10-4.

Both teams exchanged 3 run
innings in the first and the game
was actually decided in the Kap-
pa Sig third as they scored 2
runs, the second of which was
the clincher.

The game. for Delta Sigma
Phi, marked the first intramural
event for them at Pitt. They are
all transfers from the Johnstown
Campus.

During the summer. the girls
kept in condition by teaching
tennis at summer camps. entering
local tournaments. and playing
with the city league. With prac-
tice twice-a-week and last years

of a successful fall. As she sum-
med it up. “All we need is some

Runaway Game Stopped

In Intramural Opener

Delta Sigma Phi won their softball opener against Triangle. 18-
4. in a game that was halted because of the runaway score.

.Dick Trotz of Delta Sig began the game with a single to right
field. He later scored on a home run by Bob Jouret. This started
Delta Sig's scoring. They then scored 4 more runs in the first inn-

mg.

. .It was three-up—three-down for
Delta Sig in the top half of the
third. after they scored twelve
runs in the second. Triangles
first run came in the bottom of
the third when Ken Snyder scor-
ed on John Pierce‘s hit.

Delta Sig took a 17-1 lead into
the fourth when their final run
scored when Lou Pomerico drove
in Dom Fratangelo.

In the bottom of the fourth
Triangles George Claybaugh
belted the ball fore a home run.
His slam drove in two other runs.

Then, play ended after the
four innings.

In the second inning Dave
Glissner, Triangle outfielder,
collided with the center fielder
while trying to catch a Delta
Sig fly ball. He was again in-
volved in a collision while stand-
ing on the sidelines waiting to
bat. Two Delta Sigs ran into
him, pressing him between them,
as they tried to catch a pop-up.
But Glissner was unhurt.

Don Fratangelo won the pitch-
ing decision over Tom Pierce. ’

Exposure is the key word to the success of women‘s sports

Mrs. Virginia Grindle. a graduate of Slippery Rock State.Col-:_»“}
lege and three year veteran coach of Women‘s Varsity Swirii’ Team" "
at Pitt. believes exposure is an essential factor in this year's o,u‘t_-.:_q
come of the Women's Swim  -ij   ' *   5 "
Team.

Coach Grindle feels that lack
of exposure has caused some
area prospects and even some
top Pitt swimmers to attend oth-
er colleges. Even now, current
university swim talent goes un-
tapped. Some girls in the uni-
versity just don’t know the Wom-
en’s Varsity Swim Team exists.

Last year‘s team record was
three wins and two loses. Coach
Grindle believes lack of depth
was the team‘s major problem.
A team with good depth consists
of about twenty-five swimmers.
But the Pitt team consisted of
only sixteen.

Often. there were just enough
