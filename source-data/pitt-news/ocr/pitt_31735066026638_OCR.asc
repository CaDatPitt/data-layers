UPMC merges with local health system

’Mercer County,” said UPMC

Contrlbutlng Edltor

By the time the summer is over, the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
Health System will have incorporated
another two hospitals into its fold.

Two weeks ago, Horizon S 0
Health System, ‘a small institution
consisting of Greenville Regional
Hospital and Shenango Valley
Medical Center, agreed to merge
with UPMC Health System to form
UPMC Horizon, which will be
operated as a locally governed sys-
tem in Mercer County within
UPMC Health System The merger
is to be formalized at an unan-
nounced date later this summer.

“It gives us a presence in

grams, stalf or facilities. UPMC will
expand Horizon’s primary health care
facilities and emergency services, and pro-
vide its medical expertise. Horizon will
also gain access to UPMC’s secondary
and tertiary health care systems (which

endeavors continue,” said Dulfreld.

According to Dr. Gordon Macleod, a
professor in the Department of Health
Services in the Graduate School of Public
Health who served as the founding direc-
tor of the governrnent’s HMO plan pro-
gram in the 1970s, the merger should not
have too many adverse elfects on con-
sumers in Mercer County.

“Consumers would be necessarily
tied into the UPMC Health System,”
said MacLeod. “I don’t see why this
would be a negative effect. I know sev-
eral physicians in the Mercer County
area, and if there were any major con-
cerns, they would have contacted me
by now.”

By being tied into UPMC Health
System, consumers in Mercer County
would beneﬁt from access to UPMC’s
secondary and tertiary facilities. VV1th
the small patient base in rural Mercer
County, the effects on competition
would be negligible. Horizon will also
be required to have its employees sign
up for the UPMC Health Plan.

   “The UPMC Health Plan would

been announced, UPMC has promised to
continue the series of expansions and
enhancements of its services, programs
and facilities, which have been occurring
since UPMC and Horizon signed an affil-
iation agreement two years ago.
According to Duﬁield, the merger

includes local access to specialists in
rheumatology, neurosurgery, neurology
and genetic counseling).

“By building a comprehensive ,.net—
work of care, we can generate economies
and build a strong ﬁnancial foundation,
ensuring that our research and medical

expand coverage into new areas,” said i

MacLeod.

According to Dufﬁeld, medical
research would beneﬁt from the merger.

“Research, especially clinical, is
directly helped by a larger patient base,”
she said.

No scandals for
this SGB,
Wallach says

Jason Gallinger

Asslstant News Edltor

Scandal marred last summer’s
Student Government Board allocations
process when then-allocations committee
chairman Gerald Klayman and five oth-
ers stole nearly $4,000 from the student
activities fund.

Klayman and company engaged in a
plot to funnel money into bogus student
organizations. The news made headlines
and angered everybody from students to
Klayman’s mother.

But it won’t happen again this sum-
mer, said SGB president Alyson Wallach.

“There aren’t going to be any [scan-
dals] for you to write about this year,”
she told a reporter.

Last summer, the allocations com-
mittee chairman had absolute control of
the process, deciding by himself which
student groups the allocations committee
would give money to, and how much.
The resulting lack of oversight left
Klayman and his partners room to exer-
cise their scheme.

By December of last year,
Allocations Adviser Terrence Milani
changed the rules to safeguard against
future power abuses. ’

Now the summer process resembles
that of the regular school year. Three
allocations committee members must
vote in favor of a request for it to be
approved, and three members of the full
SGB must also vote in favor for the funds
to be allocated.

During the regular school year, the
allocations committee must unanimously

recommend budget requests. Two
thirds of the full SGB —— ﬁve mem-
bers —— must approve the comn1ittee’s
recommendations. In case of a tie, the
SGB president votes to break it.

Fewer SGB members are in
Pittsburgh over the summer, hence the
lower number of votes required to
approve a request. The critical element
of the new summer allocations
process, however, is that authority is
no longer centered onone person.

Wallach said she would try to mar-
shal together as many of the five SGB
members as possible in Pittsburgh this
summer, saying discussion and debate
about a request are an integral part of
the process. The more
committee members pre-
sent at a meeting, the live-
lier and more in—depth the
discussion, which helps
the board to give a request more thor-
ough consideration.

The allocations committee is
made up of 10 SGB members who
oversee distribution of the student
activities fund. The fund comes from
the $40 activities fee students pay
annually.

Student groups submit budget
requests to the allocations committee,
which cover activities and day-to-day
operating expenses. The committee
considers each group’s request, decid-
ing whether to recommend denial or
approval. The committee is entitled to
suggest a group receive less money
than it originally requested.

At its public meetings, the full
SGB considers the allocations com-
mittee’s recommendations. Members
of groups with pending requests can
explain them to the board or answer
board members’ questions.

SGB can accept or deny each of
the committee’s recommendations. If
the board denies a recommendation, it
can direct the allocations committee to
review it again based on the full
board’s input.

This summer’s allocations process
is moving along smoothly, Wallach
said, if a bit slowly. Thus far, SGB has
received only four requests.

mom PAGE 1

 

Tm: Prrr News

Wallach speculated that more
requests might be forthcoming. The
currently-pending applications are
emergency and budget modiﬁcation
requests for this ﬁscal year, which
ends June 22.

Beginning July 1, SGB will accept
emergency and budget modification
requests for next fiscal year. With a
new yearopening up, Wallach said the
trickle of requests might intensify.

SGB will vote on requests for this,

fiscal year today and issue its deci-
sions tomorrow.

Wallach said there have been no
problems with the new process,
though today’s vote will be the first of
the summer. Coordinating events
between multiple members of the
board when they aren’t regularly. on
‘ campus can be a tricky
proposition. Any ﬂaws in
the process will reveal
themselves today, she
said.

The allocations committee will
postpone consideration of as many
requests as possible for next ﬁscal
year until fall, so the entire allocations
committee can vote on them.

Requests for major purchases and
for autumn events will likely be post-

‘ poned, Wallach said.

Such requests, she said, are not
urgent and can easily be delayed until
the full allocations committee is able
to consider them. .

Wallach was unable to say how
much money is. left in this ﬁscal year’s
activities fund. Some groups may not
have spent all the money they were
granted, she said, so it is impossible
to quote a dollars and cents ﬁgure.

While Wallach said every student
isn’t expected to know the precise way
in the allocations process works, she
said she thinks it is important for stu-
dents to be aware of the process and
how it affects their lives at Pitt.

Events that occur outside of class-
es come largely through student
groups, which depend on the alloca-
tions process for funding.

Students should vote for the SGB
members who will ultimately make

these decisions, she said.

“That shows that they care who
leads them,” Wallach said.

UPMC

MacLeod said the issue of how research
is affected depends on Whether or not
UPMC assigns faculty members to UPMC
Horizon facilities in Mercer County.

“It’s a double-edged sword. It gives
UPMC access to a rural area, but the ques-
tion is, what is a University-aﬂiliated health
care system doing expanding into a rural
area? It’s a remote setting, with limited
access to research activities. It’s more rele-
vant to the School of Public Health than the
School of Medicine, because of the nature of

- Horizon’s primary health-care.”

As for competitive forces, Maclmd
commented that any effects this merger
would have on rival. health care providers
would be negligible.

‘There would be some competitive
effects if Horizon was originally refening
patients to secondary and tertiary health care
facilities in Erie or Cleveland,” said
Macleod. “There most certainly would be
some effect in the number of patients in_the
area referred for tertiary care in
Youngstown.”

Though I-Iighmark and Blue Cross
Health Care have complained about
UPMC’s monopolistic tendency in Western
Pennsylvania’s health care market,
Macleodsaidthisisacaseofthepotcalling
the kettle black because High-mark and
Blue Cross control 65 percent of the health
care management market.

MacLeod’s biggest concern with
UPMC’s continued acquisition of smaller
hospitals and mergers is that integrated

health care systems have not proven them-
selves to be effective deliverers of health
care.
“The major problem is the great

unknown,” said MacLeod. “We don’t know .

what it’s going to affect. Are one or both of
these hospitals going to survive? It is gener-
ally recognized that mergers of this nature
come up a cropper.”

Although Duﬁield has said that UPMC
will not downsize or reduce the number of
services currently offered by Horizon,
MacLeod is concerned that the overlap of
services will invariably lead to some down-
sizing.

“A major concern is that it’s a fairly high
risk We do know that certain facilities will
have to be downsized or eliminated. The
question is, which ones? We fully expect to
see the number of beds and number of hos-
pitals in the health system reduced, and those
in this area would be the ﬁrst affected,” he
said.

UPMC Horizon will be operated local-

ly within UPMC Health System. Horizon ,

will retain its current local governing body,
with one—third of its members appointed by
UPMC. Horizon will also be represented in
UPMC’s administration, with one represen-
tative on the UPMC Health System execu-
tive committee and two on the UPMC
Health System board.

UPMC is still negotiating its merger
with Magee-Womens’ Hospital in Oakland,
which should be ﬁnalized later this summer.
According to Duﬂield, UPMC is seeking to
merge and align itself with more hospitals in
the near future, though she could not elabo-
rate on that point.

and in doing so will allow investigators to
begin to [apply them] ,” said Lauren Ward,
spokeswoman for UPMC.

Dr. Brian Carr, professor of surgery in
Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute
at the UPMC Cancer Institute, said scien-
tists have known for years that vitamin K
stopped cancer cells from growing. He and
his co—workers were among the ﬁrst to put
it to use in high concentration as a cancer-
ﬁghting agent.

Carr, Chemistry Department
Chairman Craig Wilcox, and Paul Dowd, a
chemistry faculty member who recently
passed away, were on the team who tested
several compoimds, some up to 2000 times
the potency of regular vitamin K

They found that some of the com-
pounds blocked the activity of an important
group of enzymes, called protein-tyrosine
phosphates, inside the liver-cancer cells and
consequently stopped cancer growth in lab-
oratory rats. These tyrosine phosphates trig-
ger a variety of activities in cells, among
them anti-cancer effects by inducing the
shutdown and death of a cancer cell.

springboard for research in other forms of
cancer —— something that has recently start-
ed to take off.

“All this work was done on liver can-

found they work on breast cancer and

people who are at high risk for cancer
should not take high doses of the vitamin
thinking it will prevent them from getting

harmful.

He said the team have 15 dilferent

In times o conflict, play
  ball, not war

With the exception of the
drunken, rioting English fans, the
World Cup ‘98 has proven that 32
nations with radically different
political systems can get together
and have a damn good party. Would
the United States ever get together
with Iran if it weren’t for the World
Cup? Would Iran ever have a realis-
tic chance of beating the United
States if it weren’t for the World
Cup?
Why then, if there is such a
platform for countries to display
national pride (or nationalistic zeal,
as in the case of Nigeria with their
black armbands commemorating
the loss of recently deceased dicta-
tor Gen. Abacha), do nations deem
it necessary to ﬁght it out with such
conventional methods as bullets,
rockets, tanks or nuclear weapons?

Sport is an ideal platform for
nations to resolve issues. Sport and
war share two salient features: a
push towards victory by performing
better than one’s opponent and the
inﬁltration of enemy territory with
the intent to do damage (such as
annihilation or the scoring of a

’ goal).

Why are India and Pakistan
embroiled in a cold war when both
teams cou1d’ve used regular
encounters in cricket to have
resolved the Kashmir “problem?”

Inzamam Ul—Haq would destroy the
Indian bowlers, but the match
would incur less damage than
nuclear holocaust in Calcutta

The issue of whether Puerto
Rico remains a U.S. colony,
becomes the‘ 51st state, or an
autonomous republic (an issue
which has led to ﬂag-buming by
both sides) could be called by who-
ever crosses the home plate in a
heated baseball game at Yankee
Stadium the most times.

Take the case of China and
Tibet — an exciting battle for
autonomy for Tibet could be waged
not by soldiers, but by pingpong
players paddling T1bet’s fate at high
speed These days, a Tibetan team
would not be hard-pressed to ﬁnd a
sponsor.

Palestine and Israel’s conﬂicts
would be all over if they decided
them by chariot racing, a method
used by the Romans 2,000 years
ago. As long as Harnas does not
carry out chariot—bombing, or
Netanyahu does not build Israeli
settlements on the Palestinian
tracks, it should go smoothly.

War can be fought by anyone,
but it takes skill, panache and
devout fans to crush one’s enemy
with a sport.

Let a soccer ball decide
mankind’s fate —— not an atomic
bomb.

Divide, rule & nuke ’em all

After the first test of the atomic bomb,
Robert Oppenheimer famously quoted the
“Bhagavad Gita”: “I am become death, the
destroyer of worlds.” Needless to say, this
was the first anecdote that came to mind
when India began its latest round of nuclear
tests.

But Oppenheimer himself noted that his
own comment was far from the most appro-
priate on that ominous day in 1945. Rather,
the award went to test director Ken
Bainbridge, who remarked simply: “Now
we’re all sons of bitches.” Now that
Pakistan has followed India’s lead in dis-
playing its ﬁrepower for all the world to
see, there must be some in the
First World’s corridors of power
who are making this latter obser-
vation. .

I have to wonder, though. The
remarkable incapacity of our
rulers to grasp even the most obvious his-
torical lessons is a phenomenon that never
ceases to amaze. Doubtless many of them
are now fuming with indignation at all of
this inexplicable Asian jingoism, with nary
a thought that their own nuclear arsenals
might have something to do with it. Very
few of them, if any, are contemplating the
fact that had they heeded the concerns of
arms-control advocates some 20 years ago,
the danger of nuclear proliferation would
not be nearly as severe as it is today.

Further, the budding South Asian cold
war is more proof of the futility of another
Western policy — imperialist partition.
Pakistan owes its very existence to the
mutually—reinforcing Hindu and Muslim
chauvinisms of the Indian subcontinent,
which were manipulated by the British until
the latter forced partition along religious
lines. Since then, Pakistan has been a useful
tool of imperial ambitions, especially those
of the United States, which has used it as a
staging ground for the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism (in the name of anti-
Communism) into Afghanistan and else-
where in the Middle East. Needless to say,
the United States has always returned its
favors when necessary, e.g., when the U.S.
“tilted” toward Pakistan in its notoriously
bloody attempt to stop the revolt of East
Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1971.

This latter event demonstrated the key

fact about partition: it always leads to
another war. It also often leads to another
partition. Shall we consider a few other
examples?

Ireland, as Britain’s ﬁrst colony, was
the first country to undergo this shameful
ordeal when its six northern counties were
severed from the rest of the country in the
early 1920s, producing results with which
we are all too familiar. Any who are under
the illusion that the latest “peace agree-
ment” is going to work had better pay heed
to the ravings of the Rev. Ian Paisley, who
is still a factor in the Northern Protestant
community and will continue to be so.

Need I mention Cyprus,
which may be heading for anoth-
er confrontation this year as a
result of the plans to include the
island in the European Union?
And then there’s Palestine, a
topic about which it is possible to go on for-
ever. (Incidentally, who is complaining
about the nuclear arsenal of the main pro-
tagonist in that part of the world?)

Most recently, the technique has been
applied to Bosnia, a country which was
never even a colony. After this nation was
cut to pieces in a semi-genocidal war (by
the way, how many of us even recall this
appalling little episode?), a NATO “peace
[piece?] plan” formally reduced this tiny
territory to a complicated patchwork of
uncooperative mini-statelets beholden to
neighboring neo-fascist regimes. And now,
emboldened by the legitimation of “ethnic
cleansing,” one of these regimes (the
Serbian one) is taking the liberty of victim-
izing the people of one of its own provinces
(Kosovo), in search of another possible par-
tition.

But the Indian subcontinent, with its
history of Pakistani-Indian conﬂict and pre-
sent-day population of over one billion,
remains by far the biggest partition disaster
story. Thanks to recent developments, the
disaster may become an even bigger cata-
strophe. This time, though, another war
might not lead to another partition because
there may not be any people left to undergo
the partitioning.

Columnlst

An article in The Pitt News about a
recent mugging of a Pitt student, who after-
wards emphasized the need for better securi-
ty in Oakland, prompted me to write about
an incident that caused me to evaluate per-
sonal safety — something that a lot of us
take for granted

I recently left my Squirrel Hill apart-
ment for a sublet in the “mean” streets of
Oakland I familiarized myself with the pre-
cautions of living in an unfamiliar apartment
building, but I knew if I stayed on my guard
and took the right measures to play it safe,
I’d be okay.

But I didn’t prepare myself for a

I stranger trying to force himself into my

apartment on a routine door-to-door sales
outing.

I was easing into my nightly routine of
preparing dinner and watching “ESPN
Sportscenter’ ’ when there was a knock at the
door. I asked who it was, and he answered,
“Oh, I’m not going to kill you or_.anything!”

' I couldn’t quite recognize the muffled
voice behind the door, but I opened it (bad
move!) and was greeted by a smiling col-
lege-aged boy. He started on this sales pitch
about how he wanted me to buy magazines
so he’d get points to go on a Caribbean vaca-
tron.

How nice, I thought, but I already knew
I didn’t want anything and tried to tell him.

“Can I come in?” he asked, still stand-
ing in my doorway. I hesitated and asked
him how he got into the building. He said the
front door was open and he “just walked in”

Oh geez. Why hasn’t the front door lock
been ﬁxed? This guy could have

About 30 minutes later, as I was on my
way to pick up a prescription, I heard him
inside another apartment, tossing the same
sales pitch and getting the same negative
reaction. I didn’t hear what he said, but I was

and demanded that he leave the premises.

In defense of elitism: art

Geoffrey W.

Itseernsenvoguethesedaystoaccuse
high art (and its creators) ofthe deadly sin of
elitism. Surprisingly, even the National
Endown1entfortheArts hasjoinedinthe act.
In a curiously self-elfacing report issued this
past October, the N.E.A. condemned art insti-
tutions for being “elitist, racially segregated,
class-based and isolated from the communi-
ties they claim to serve, but don’t.”

I cannot help but be bemused by all this
rhetoric. I could understand this debate in the
context of some Communist country, but not
here in America. I think we have seriously
distorted the meaning of democracy. While
each of us living in this country can lay claim
to certain inalienable human rights, there is
no provision in our constitution for universal
access to art New York Trrnes critic Edward
Rothstein, in his article “Where a Democracy
and Its Money Have no Place,” reminds us
that art is simply not compatible with the ide-
ology of democracy. Art is, as stated by
Rothstein, “an essentially undemocratic
achievement by extraordinarily gifted indi-
viduals.” Art is always engaged in the prac-
tice of difference and discrimination, and
only the naive or quixotic mind would
attempt to deny this fact.

Moreover, art is not created despite the
popular fallacy, for the sake of mankind As
philosopher Ayn Rand Writes in "The
Fomtainhead”: “No creator was prompted

by adesireto servehisbrothers, forhisbroth-
ersrejectedthegiftheotferedandthatgift
destroyed the slothful routine of their lives.
I-Iis truth was his only motive. His own truth,
and his own work to achieve it in his own
way. A symphony, a book, an engine, a phi-
losophy, an airplane or a building ——'—— that was
his goal and his life. Not those who heard
read, operated, believed, ﬂew or inhabited the
thing he had created”
Theabilitytocreateartisnotdistributed
equally or in a democratic fashion, and nei-
theristheabilitytoperceive or evaluate it.Art
depends on elitism for its survival; elitism is
art’s primary defense mechanism. To force
art to be more inclusive, more democratic,
and more “relevant” (all goals of the N .E.A.)
is to cause its degradation. It is irony that such
attempts, conceived out of a desire to help

loss for humanity.

The world of classical music is an excel-
lent place to locate this debate. Performers of
classical music and their audiences have been
thetargetsofagreatdealofcriticismasof
late. The genre is accused, among other
things, of being too inaccessible, too white,
too wealthy. The ﬂaws in this bit of logic are
many. That classical music has become inac-
cessible to most Americans is no surprise. We
watch more hours of television per person
than any other  nation in the
world—afactwetakeaperversepridein.
Tlut alone explains our nation’s problem of
plummeting attention spans. We want every-

pened, but what if something had?

Although this may not sound very seri-
ous to you, a stranger poking around an
apartment building and an unlocked door to
a large apartment building ﬁlled with stu-
dents are certainly causes for concern.

Your personal safety, and the safety of
your roommate or roommates, is of utmost

I won’t get preachy ,and I certainly

don’t want to instill fear, but I think that it is .

important for students living in this area (and
other urban college areas like Oakland) to
keep a few things in mind when living in od-
campus housing:

- Never let door-to-door salespeople in
your apartment or apartment building. They
may seem nice, but you can’t always see a
wolfin sheep’s clothing.

0 Ifthere is antmfamiliarperson walk-
ing around your building, politely ask him if
he is with someone in the building. If he
isn’t, you have the right to ask him to leave
the premises. It’s your apartment building
and your comfort zone.

0 Check your building to see if the front
door lock is secured and if the buzzer is
working properly..

- KEEP YOUR FRONT DOOR
LOCKED. Mom should have told you this‘ a
long time ago.

0 And lastly, notify your landlord if there
are security problems in your building.
Some might not have faith in landlords, but
if you inform them, most will promptly
address any security issues.

And if you open the door toﬁnd a
young guy asking you to pick two maga-
zines from his list so he can go to Bermuda,
just slam the front door in his face.

& classical music on trial

thing fast and easy: our food, our cars, our
information, our entertainment. Is it any won-
der that the majority of Americans couldn’t

tried? Did we not hear once that a live telecast

of one of Beethoven’s choral symphonies.

would have to be interrupted for commer-
cials? Who is to blame for this outrage? I dare
say the listener is to blame. I certainly would-
n’t blame the medium

By inaccessibility, critics of classical
music also refer to the exclusion of the eco-
nornically underprivileged There is no deny-
ing that classical music has long been patron-
ized by the upper strata ofsociety. Arecent
trip to the Philadelphia Academy of Music to
see DonizetIi’s “Daughter of the Regiment”
conﬁrmed this for me. But hasn’t there been
a concerted effort by orchestras and opera
companies in this country to reduce the ﬁnan-
cial deterrent? The Philadelphia Academy of
Music, for example, sells tickets to the opera
for as low as eighteen dollars. What popular
band in this country — considered so univer-
sal and accessible —— sells such reasonably
priced tickets to its concerts? The Pittsburgh
Symphony and Pittsburgh Opera give free
performances throughout the summer at var-
ious public parks throughout the city. How
often do pop musicians perform for free?
Maybe once or twice in their whole careers,
and then only if it provides them with valu-
able media exposure. Furthermore, what
musical genre would these critics hold as a
paragon of economic inclusiveness? One can

ﬁnd bargain classical music recordings in

nearly every music store. The same cannot be '

said of so-called popular music, like rap for
instance.

And look at the results of yielding to
expediency in the case of classical music. The
classical music industry has desperately tried
to embrace show business, producing sensa-
tions like David Helfgott (not considered a
great or even particularly good pianist) and
the Three Tenors (two of which are consider-
ably past their prime). Critics like James R.
Oestreich of the New York Trrnes have point-
ed out that such attempts to make classical
music a mass medium have failed: "The
tumout for the likes of David Helfgott and the
Three Tenors has little effect on the day-to-
day operations of musical institutions beyond
encouraging them to chase Chimeras.
Making classical music available to everyone
is one thing, trying to create an endlessly
expanding market is another.”

It seems clear that for classical music --
and other forms of high art — to survive in
this culture of global consumerism, or what
political scientist Benjamin Barber calls
“McWorld,” its supporters must learn to walk
a very ﬁne line: preserving the essence and
integrity of classical music without alienating
themselves from a world of changing atti-
tudes. '

With two albums out on Moon
Ska Records and a Video on MTV,
Skavoovie and the Epitones are on
their way to making it big, but they
aren't taking any chances.

They sacrificed touring and
recording during their college years
for classes, but ﬁnals are over for
these ska giants. Now they're back
out supporting, Ripe, last summer's
release, their second on Moon.

This Sunday, the tour brings
them to Club Laga with Skinnerbox
and Mustard Plug.

It promises to be a wicked

show. Skavoovie and the Epitones
are probably the most talented
group of ska musicians next to the
Skatalites, ska’s creators.

Ripe opens with ”]apanese
Robot.” From the first trumpet blips
and funky repetitive bass-line, it's
vastly different from their ﬁrst disc,
Put Pootin. ’

Their MTV release, "Blood Red
Sky,” is traditional Skavoovie —
smooth lyrics, complex horn lines
and spontaneous solos over jazz
chord progressions. As did Pat
Pootin’, Ripe features a 1930's swing
song. This time they play Duke
Ellington's "B1i-Blip."

Skavoovie and the Epitones, you

enough to inspire a mosh pit. It was
the ﬁrst time I saw people mosh to

It wasn't the last time, though.

A pit broke out again during
the last song they played, the origi-
nal "She Sure Can Cook." It's a sim-
ple 12-bar blues song played in a
big-band format, with a ska beat. As
with most Skavoovie songs, every
band member hits a solo in this
instrumental. Vocalist Ansis Purins
takes a skat solo, and the last time
through the 12-bars shows how the
song got its name — it cooks.

New Albums

Adore
SmwWmgPwmMww
W@mRwm¢

A great song may be inspi-
rational, but a great theme
album inspires religious wor-
ship.

An album that is blas-
phemed and bastardized by
fractured listening, that is
much greater than the sum of
its parts, that carries and
examines a theme throughout,
and that most bands would
turn into a pretentious MTV
hit, qualiﬁes as a theme album.

And the Smashing
Pumpkins’ Adore, their first
album in almost three years, is
a theme album for the ages.

In 1995, SP fans realized
the quartet was capable of
even more than the near-per-
fection of Siamese Dream. They
heard Mellon Collie and the
Inﬁnite Sadness blend the
adrenaline-producing ”Zero”
with a dozen tunes as soft and
soothing as ”197 .”

Their latest effort takes
songs of introspection and
serenity to a level few musi-
cians ever obtain.

The first song, ”To Sheila,”
is a harpsical lullaby in which
lead singer Billy Corgan’s
words roll out of the music like
mist, not apart from the instru-
ments but androgynously
indistinct. Lyrics like,
”Twilight fades through blis-
tered avalon/ the sky’ s cruel
torch on aching autobahn”
show individual pain project-
ed onto a universal median
from which listeners can easily
elicit feelings. .

Songs like ”Perfect,”
”Daphne Descends” and
”Appe1s + Oranjes” continue
the Charmin-soft music, but
resemble the Cure and the
Cranberries a bit by giving it
more of an up-beat tempo. The
combination created by SP
gives the album something of
a 1920's, gothic feel.

The true intelligence of
this album is shown in the
ﬁnal track, however, titled 17.
Like the ending of a classic
epic movie, it closes out the
album with an unforgettable
piece of God-on-Earth. Also
like the ending of a movie, I
can't give away the finisher to
a theme album this magnifi-
cent.

Freak-
on—ica, the
1 a t e s t
release
from hard
rock band
G i r l 5
Against Boys, marks a change
for the band.

They've traded the low-ﬁ
for the hi-fi and moved toward
the future guitar sounds of
America — full of electronic
effects, samples, and comput-
erized noise. To the fans of
GVSB,‘ the future is not quite
what you may have expected.

Unlike their previous
albums, 1-“reak—on—ica sounds
like a cyberpunk soundtrack,
something to complement the
stories of William Gibson. The
deep bass, staccato drum beats
and metronornic keyboards
synthesize future-esque urban
images. The album maintains
an electronic edge. The tone of
Fre'ak—on-ica ﬂuctuates between

a slow bass-driven melody to
a faster, more upbeat keyboard
and drums track.

Guitarist Scott McCloud
and keyboardist Eli Janney
captivate the masses with
McCloud’s sensual, husky
rasp backed by Ianney’ s non-
chalant voice, giving each
song a hypnotic feel.

At times, the lyrics of
1-"reak—0n—ica "border on the
rhetoric of Marshall McLuhan,
drawing on the elements of
the perpetual now and the
super-iconic individual. The
radio single ”Park Avenue”
states: ”fuse the power of
now / fuse the power of
never / it’ s no apocalypse.”
Another example is song nine,

”Vogue Thing,” which rings
”eyes by heaven / ass by
armani/ gucci forever.”
Freak—on—ica capitalizes on
the popularity of the fusion
between dance, club beat and
electric guitars. But the album
slows down after about the
third or fourth song. The gui-
tars drone and the keyboards
and drums meander. The

Jordan rules the
NBA, for now

Unstoppabull. Unbelievabull. Just
truly remarkabull is what comes to
mind when I think of the man named
Michael Jordan. He’s without a doubt
a living legend, the greatest basketball
player of all time and one of the most
stand—up, classiest ﬁgures in the histo-
ry of sports.

Throughout my affair with the game
of basketball, Air Jordan has been
there with me. He helped in changing
its limitations — exceeding every
expectation and placing himself and
the rest of the league on a never-
before-reached plateau.

Granted, Oscar Robertson, Magic
Johnson, Larry Bird and Dr. J were
revolutionaries in their own rights, but
what MJ has done for the game could-
n’t possibly have been imagined.

When he entered the league,there
were no expectations for him. He was
a ﬂashy, exciting player who won a
championship for the University of
North Carolina, but no one said he had
to be special, no one said he had to be
the man, no one even thought of six
World Championships and six NBA
Finals MVP awards. I _

How many people do you know that
can be recognized in so many ways
like Jordan? For example: ﬁrst name,
last name, initials, Air, the outline of
his head, the outline of his body (legs
spread, tongue out, ball arched above),
Nike, Gatorade, Wheaties, Hanes,
Disney, 23, you can even smell like
Mike if you want to. Not to mention
his merchandise supported by people
throughout the world.

Nowadays, every promising young
player has to live up to Michael’s stan-
dards. Every owner, coach and agent
dreams of his guy becoming the next
Jordan.

Wake up everyone in the basketball
world! It’s not gonna happen because
you want it to. It won’t happen with
$130 million contracts. It won’t hap-
pen with major endorsements and
celebrity status.

Mike didn’t even expect to do what
he did, and I know that’s why he cher-
ishes what the game allows him to do.
That’s why he goes further than any-
one’s ever gone. That’s why we saw
him hugging and crying and kissing
that trophy with so much raw emotion
and love for the thing he enjoys most.

To play. To compete. To challenge
himself and everyone who tries to stop
him.

ne rules should efit good defensive

Joe Carmody

Staff Wrlter

The NCAA armounced a rule
change that will reward men’s bas-
ketball players whose defensive hus-
tle forces held-ball situations.

This rule brings the game back to
the players. It allows the defense to
make a big play and be rewarded,
regardless of the direction the posses-
sion arrow is pointed. The ball will be
awarded at the closest designated
spot to where the jump ball occurred.

The NCAA Men’s Basketball
Rules Committee approved that
change and others - including an
experimental rule designed to shorten
the time needed to play the last few
minutes of televised games - during
its armual meeting last weekend at
Isle of Palms, S.C. These changes
were armounced last Wednesday.

“The committee feels that this
change will reward outstanding
defensive plays that in the past went
unrewarded if the possession arrow
belonged to the offense,” said Herb
Kenny in a news release armouncing
the change. Kenny is the athletics

 

NCAA gets new rules

director at Wesleyan University and
the rules committee chairman.

Adding momentum toward the
change was Kentucky’s 86-85 over-
time victory against Stanford in the
semiﬁnals of this year’s NCAA
Tournament. Stanford forced a jump
ball late in the game, but Kentucky
retained the ball because of the pos-
session arrow.

ESPN’s Dan Bonner said, ‘This
rule change rewards the defense for
forcing a held-ballm, which is fairly
close to stealing it. It’s consistent with
the ﬁve-second—closely-guarded rule,
in that it encourages team defense,
forcing the offense to move the ball
aroun .”

I know from listening to ESPN
and ABC college basketball analyst
Dick Vitale preach over and over
again about rewarding the defensive
hustle, that he is thrilled about this
rule change.

The altemate—possession arrow
would still apply in situations in
which the defense didn’t cause the
jump ball, such as if a live ball
became wedged in a basket support

Athletes still work hard during the summer

Brian Knavlsh
Asst. Sports Editor

Ahhh, the summertime. Time to
kick back, take it easy, maybe relax
with a cold beer or two. And just like
the rest of us students, the Pitt athletes
are probably at home, resting on the
couch for next season.

Not quite.

V Our Pitt athletes aren’t taking the
summer off. Whether they’re still in
Pittsburgh or temporarily residing
wherever home is, they are all running
and lifting, training and sweating in the
sticky summer heat.

Foremost in everyone’s mind are
the football players. Under the guidance
of Strength Coach Buddy Morris, the
team is enduring a daily workout pro-
gram so intense it would make you
vomit.

“I never imagined we’d do that
much running,” redshirt freshman
offensive lineman Mike Bosnic
explained. “We run every day and we
lift three days a week.”

These runs aren’t leisurely jogs,
either. They’re endless sets of sprints,
usually up the stadium steps, and often
carrying cinder blocks.

“On Fridays, we push cars,” Bosnic
added.

The offensive linemen have also
been receiving some helpful on-hand
tutelage and footwork from former
Steeler A1l—Pro Tunch Illkin.

But the football guys aren’t the only
ones sweating it out this summer.

“They sent a workout program
home to us called ‘Panther Power’,”
wrestler Rob Loper explains.

His workout program also involves
running and lifting, but Loper also
knows the value of sharpening his tech-
nique on the mat. 

He and several 3"
teammates wrestled in
the University Nationals
freestyle wrestling tour-
nament in May and cap-
tured sixth place. Loper
would have undoubtedly
ﬁnished higher, but he
withdrew from the tour-
nament early.

Loper is also cri-
tiquing the technique of
younger grapplers as a
counselor at a wrestling
camp held at a high

 

8011001 near his 1101116 in A lot of Pitt's off-season workohap i thi

Erie.

Loper, who will come back to
Pittsburgh this week, plans to get
involved in group workouts with his
teammates on Monday and Wednesday
nights.

Summer conditioning isn’t just a
“guy thing.” Lady Panthers work just as
hard as the boys.

World Cup Iclkes cenler stage

Tony Dresmslzov
For The Pltt News

There’s no better place for a
soccer hooligan than the World
Cup. The French learned this the
hard way.

For a nation that does not see
much of soccer-linked, off-pitch
battles, hosting a World Cup
involving England is to become
a gruesome experience.

With the tournament going
well beyond expectations, the
hooligans really stole the show at
the end of the ﬁrst week of com-
petition. It was like a curse on the
beautiful old port of Marseille.
As the England - Tunisia game
approached, thousands of
English fans poured into the
streets, got quickly drunk and
began ﬁghting whoever they
met: Tunisian “opponents,” citi-
zens, street police and - no kid-
ding - riot police.

In an act of sheer madness,
some guys who did not make it
to the stadium were watching the
game on a giant screen on the
beach, which became a battle-
ground after an Alan Shearer
goal. They went amok and
attacked the Tunisian fans,
women and children included. It
made the delicate French wonder

who the devil brought the World
Cup - and its curse - to their
peaceful country.

Well, English fans have a
history of mischief. Because of
their deadly habits back in the
‘80’s, the English clubs were
banned for four years from the
European club cups.

39 men died in the notorious
Heyzel stadium in Bruxelles in
1985. It was such a daunting
event that it brought the abolition
of the stadium.

Now the hooligans are back,
and at the worst of moments.
They caught the publics attention
by smashing shop windows,
hurling chairs around cafes, beat-
ing citizens and bombarding
police with bottles and cans at a
time when, down on the ﬁeld, 32
teams began showing soccer was
not in recess.

Many have thought that the
tendency to make soccer more
physical and defensive brought
the game to the rim of absurdity.
But the start of the World Cup
presented us with a number of
very good games and with the
savoury discovery that not a sin-
gle bad team had made it to the
ﬁnals - which was often the case
before.

With eight groups of four

teams playing each other, the
ﬁrst two going to the knock-out
stage, everybody is going out for
a quick win, which gives three
points. The draw is worth only
one point and normally means
little in the ﬁrst game. While all
eyes were on the favorites,
Brazil, they managed to take the
three points out of the ﬁrst game
with a 2-1 win over Scotland - a
feat that had been impossible to
most World Champions since
their presence at the opening
game was established in 1966.

And 21-year-old Ronaldo
shrugged off the burden of
expectations to become the star
of the tournament while display-
ing touches of sheer ﬁnesse.

Another team that found its
form in time and silenced the
critics was Nigeria coming twice
from behind to beat game
favorite Spain 3-2, in a match
that is arguably the gem of the
World Cup so far.

Argentina held off brave
Japan 1-0, and England rnaturely
disposed of Tunisia 2-O, although
neither of them played as a future
World Champion.

Italy was on the brink of dis-
aster against Chile after two
goals from Lazio Rome and
striker Marcelo Salas, but man-

 
 
  

aged a 2-2 draw. The
Netherlands was held to a 0-0
draw by Belgium, and players
were left regretting that they did
not make more of the lightning
speed of Mark Overmars.

Some brilliant touches by
the Croatian stars Boban,
Procinecki, Suker and Stanic
sank the reggae boys of Jamaica
3-1 in the battle of the newcom-

Host France lived up to
expectations, making a conﬁdent

registering the most one-sided
result so far.

The US team started out in a
way a realistic man should have
easily predicted. They lost 0-2 to

Germany, never really giving
their opponents any trouble.
Eddie Pope was indomitable
on defense and did a splendid job
of marking the best goal scorer in
Italy Serie A, Oliver Birhoif. But
that was the only bright point.
Yugoslavia, after beating
Iran 1-0, and Germany head the
group with three points each.
Uncle Sam’s Army should go for
a win against the Serbs, and it
seems a much more realistic aim
bearing in mind their dull game
against the Asian underdog Iran.
Four years ago, the

Americans made it to the second

at least match that performance.

McClure said. V

As the name implies, the “Death
Shuttle Run” isn’t fun. It’s unique com-
pared to other types of death-training,
though, because it involves audio tape.

McClure described it as a series of
shuttle runs in a 22-yard area. The play-
ers run while the tape plays “beeps.” As
the beeps get faster and faster, the girls
have to run faster and faster.

“We end up running all out for
about 20 minutes,” she added.

Women’s Soccer Head Coach
Roland Sturk has instructed his team to
sit on the couch sometimes . . . to watch
the World Cup and pay close attention
to how the best in the world play.

A big part of the Pitt summer con-
ditioning program has been the addition
of former professional‘ body builder
Kim King to the Panther conditioning
staff.

“Buddy Morris approached me;
he’s known me for years,” explained
King, who also owns a gym on Route

51 in Whitehall.

While King isn’t working with the
football team, she is working with all
the female sports and many other men’s
sports.

She designed the off-season work-
out programs and holds voluntary con-
ditioning sessions every day, twice a
day, in Pitt stadium. T

For the athletes who aren’t .in
Pittsburgh over the summer, King
mailed them their lifting regimen.

“I wanted to design a good workout
for basic body parts that you might
need for all sports,” she explained.
“That was something I thought was
lacking for athletes at this level.’’

King will design individualized
workouts for each sport in the fall.

“I think we’ll see some good
results. The kids have noticed some
incredible changes so far.”

“They were apprehensive at first
because they weren’t sure what to
expect. But their work ethic is far better
than I expected. It’s voluntary. They
don’t have to be ”[at the conditioning
sessions], but they are here every day.”

or if players from each team simultaneous-
ly knocked a loose ball out of bounds.

Along with the defensive change,
some other permanent changes have been
made.

Basket interference will be called if a
player pulls down on a movable basket rim
and it touches the ball before returning to
its original position. Previously, there was
no speciﬁc rule for this situation.

Also, when a double personal foul is
called, the ball will be awarded to the team
that was in possession. There will be no
change in the possession arrow, and the
shot clock will not be reset. Previously,
possession was determined by the arrow.

New provisions in the uniforms rule
will require jerseys to be a single color
from the base of the neck to the bottom.
Undershirts must be similar to the jersey
color and sleeves must be the same length,
without frayed or ragged edges.

In addition, this rule limits how close
names and logos may be placed to jersey
numbers.

FROM PAGE 12

There will be some experimental rules
in effect in designated games next season.

Full-length television timeouts will be
called at the ﬁrst stoppage of play after the
16-,12—,8-, and 4-minute marks in each
half. Teams will have ﬁve timeouts of 30
seconds each. The ﬁrst timeout called by

I either team will be extended to a full time-

out. Each team will be allowed to carry
four of the shortened timeouts into the sec-
ond half of play.

Another experimental rule is that the
ﬁrst free throw lane space will be moved
10 inches further from the basket. This rule
is designed to cut down on rough playdur-
ing free throws. In some games, the shot
clock will be extended from 35 to 45 sec-
onds.

These new rules appear promising in
bringing some of the game back to the
players. They put emphasis on defensive
teamwork and get rid of the burden of the
controversial possession arrow. And with
the conservative uniform rule, more atten-
tion will be on the team as a whole. This
will bring better basketball to the players,
coaches, university officials and fans
around the country.
