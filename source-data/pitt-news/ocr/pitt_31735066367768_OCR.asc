3 Areas
Underway

The Second Annual Institute in
Economic, Social, and Industrial
Development, being sponsored by
the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs, launched its
12-week session with an informal
reception and supper yesterday.

The Institute deals with prac-
tical policy alternatives facing
governmental and private leaders
as well as administrative and op-
erational methods which serve the
development process. -

Speciﬁcally emphasized through-
out the Institute are responsible
decision—making, effective institu-
tion building, and efficient admin-
istration. ~

The program is designed for
senior foreign and United States
Government Officials, business
and industrial leaders, and key
officers of voluntary organiza-
tions. The areas of main con-
centration with this group are
the emerging‘countries of Asia,
Africa, and Latin America.

During the sixth and seventh
weeks, the group will move to
Puerto Rico or another rapidly
developing area, to examine and
evaluate some of the problems and
operational approaches in a so-
ciety undergoing economic devel-
opment and social change.

Today’s program will include a
tourof the University facilities
and a talk on “National Goals and
the Commitment of Development”
by Dr. Milton J. Esman, head of
the Economic and Social Develop-
ment program, and director of the

Institute.

 Dr. ebastian Found Guilty of Bribe
  'Court Says Doctor I

Attempted Payoff

By JIIVI 0’BRIEN ,,

Dr. Edward H. Sebastian, accused of trying to bribe two
University basketball players, was found “guilty as charged”
in Criminal Court No. 8 last Thursday afternoon.

Sebastian was found guilty of trying to entice senior
co-Captains John Fridley and Dick Falenski to shave points

in basketball games—-control the point spread--by offering.

R. F. Whitman
Reviews Plays

On We.dnesday

Replacing the Book Center's
book review Wednesday will be
the review by Prof. Robert F.
Whitman of two new plays, Jean
Anouilh’s “Becket,” a stirring
tragedy, and the avant-garde
_comedy “Rhinoceros,” by Eugene
lnnesco.

Professor Whitman taught at
Princeton University for ﬁve
years before joining the Univer-
sity. He comes well qualified to
discuss these two Broadway hits
since he has a special interest
in Modern European and Amer-

I ican Drama in which he offered

courses in last term.

Jean Anouilh is best known in
America for “The Lark”. and
“Time Remembered.” “Becket” is
a play that goes beyond Thomas

»Becket’s martyrdom, as depicted

in Eliots “Murder in the Cathe-
dral,” and also is concerned with
the effects upon King Henry II.

Dr. Whitman, who joined the
University faculty last September
as an assistant professor ‘of En-
glish, received his B.A. degree
from Cornell University and his
Master’s and Ph.D. degrees from
Harvard University.

The review will be given at
4:15 p.m. in the Fine Books Room

and Miss Hoyer.

of the Book Center.

tion of Everyman, an English morality play. Director Michael Mc-

scholarships.

Fridley and Falenski declined
to grab the bait and ﬁled state-
ments against Dr. Sebastian on
Dec. 11, 1959, right before the
Steel Bowl tournament began».

Presidents Charged

“The University of Pittsburgh
owes Fridley and -Falenski,” Dis-
trict Attorney Edward E. Fagan
remarked during the trial, “such

a debt of gratitude that they will '

never be able to pay.”

Sports Illustrated (May 8,
1961) charged the presidents
(or chancellor) of seven schools
involved in the basketball scan-
dals as accomplices in the cor-
ruption of the players who took
bribes to ﬁx games. .

Dr. Sebastion flatly denied the
accusations of bribing the two
students, but in the hall he con-
ﬁded, “It’s pretty tough trying to

buck the University. The odds are

stacked against me.”

Jury Mostly Women
Nobody could alter those odds

except the jury, and as one detec-

tive whispered, “They don’t know
anything about basketball.” The
jury was composed of nine women
and three men.

Ribnian Questions
Rolnantie Critics;
Defends Shelley

By BARRY GROSS

Ronald Ribman, a graduate

student who is just ﬁnishing, I

his/dissertation for a Ph.D.
in English Literature, spoke’
at the Thursday, May 5
meeting of the Graduate Hu-
manities Club on “Shelley in
Wonderland.” '

Ribman began by considering
the criticisms of the-last 30 years
on the Romantic poets as “usually
mumblings" that are mostly repe-
titious._

Criticism seems to be a stock
market: the stocks of some poets
like Keats are up, but most Of
them. Shelley,
down.

especially are

Tate Misses
Next, Riban singled out Tate’s
criticism as a barrage that mostly
misses its mark. To do this he
analyzed She-.lley’s poem, “Adon-

ya

1s.‘
The poem is organized in
three parts; the ﬁrst part ad-
vances the statement that
everything dies. In, it acording
to Ribman, Keats death is
seen by his mourners as 21- mir-
ror of their own deaths. ~

He felt that this view is altered
in the second part’s concept: man
dies, but nature does not die. The
sky advances from dawn to dark-
ness, and then the order of time
is in disorder as the next morn-
ing rises in a mist, neither asleep
nor awake. '

Death Liberates

Another reversal occurs in the
third part: death is entrance into
the eternal. In earlier stanzas,
Ribman believed that Shelley had
prepared the image of the sky as
a many-colored globe. Our lives
are only a reflection, under this
globe, of eternity?’

Death, then, is the liberator
that shatters the globe and ad-
mits the white radiance of
eternity. ‘

One of Tate’s criticisms is of
this globe as an inorganic image.
But Ribman said that the image
is organic enough “to leap out and
bite him on the nose.”

He concluded his talk by saying
that “Someone is in wonderland
and ‘not Shelley.” Ribman feels
that Shel1ey’s poetry will survive

RONALD RIBMAN warms up for his discussion of “Shelley in

Wonderland" by an informal beforehand discussion period. The
Ph. D. candidate spoke before the Graduate Humanities Club, and
criticized the critics of the Romantics as repetitious mumblers.

Tate’s provincialism
dice.

One of the many comments
made in the discussion that fol-
lowed, concerned Ribman's
method of criticism.

While agreeing

and preju-

’1‘ate’s faults, a member of the
audience wondered whether or
not he wasn’t using Tate’s own
method of criticism in theprocess.
Ribman replied that Tate’s meth-
od is an expert one and that his

that Ribmanlquarrel is with his attitude, not

E. Sebastian
Charged Guilty
For Bribery

(Continued from Page 1)
Another official commented
after the trial,\“I’ve been in this
business for 35 years andil knew
that he would be convicted.”
Referring to the fact that Dr.
Sebastian's entire defense rested
on the testimony of 13 character
witnesses, including a banker, two

school officials, two Duquesne Uni-
versity Pharmacy School profes—:
sors, a doctor, several personal’
friends, and four dentists, the oﬁ"i- .
cial added, “It wouldn’t have mat— I
tered if he had ﬁve ministers,
three rabbis, and four priests as-
character witnesses, who’s going
to doubt the word of two clean-
cut boys from the University of
Pittsburgh.” ‘

“He'll probably be paroled,” he
continued, “but he’ll lose his prac— 3
lice. What worse punishment is
there?”

The trial revealed the fact that

Fridley was the ﬁrst approached,-
and at the advice of his father, gotl
Sebastian, ‘

Falenski to meet Dr.

too, in an effort to secure a wit-
ness. "

subjecting himself to possible

amples: a student was quite

accidently carried through the
turn-still, and, although the
book bore proof of ownership,
the student was required to pro-

duce a bill of sale in order to
get his book back. Another stu-

“Just checking that you haven’t

states, under the heading Stu-

A selves to ideas differing from their own environ-‘

Culturel Killer

By Inc Amdur
National mediocrity inevitably take! its toll. In
America our quest for the mediocre in everything

_ has led to the establishment and the maintenance

of a committee which symbolizes our national cult
of non-excellence. The House Un—American Activi-
ties Committee (HUAC) sup-
ported by the Supreme Court and
by various outstanding congress-
men is beginning to resemble the
Gestapo. It now has the right to
subpoena anyone without stating
the reason for the summons be-
fore the person arrives at the'l
hearing. A

Needless to say, once a person
is brought before the HUAC, his
liberty and his intellectual free-
dom have been so far infringed
upon that even if he is found innocent, a serious
injustice has still been committed. If he refuses to
testify he will probably be imprisoned for a short
time or harrassed for'the rest of his life. If he
does testify he will still be incriminating others who
are no more guilty than himself.

It is not surprising, however, that such a com-
mittee has been established in our country. It is
also not surprising that so much power has been
given to it. The decaying spirit of Joseph Mc-
Carthy still hangs over us‘ and is reincarnated in
countless short-sighte\d and exceedingly ignorant
politicians. Anyone who thinks and voices his.
thoughts publicly is in danger of being called a
Communist. If the policies of the United States are
criticized in anyway the criticizer can be accused
of leftist tendencies. Although it is probable that
the leaders of the HUAC know nothing about the
history or the content of Marxism, and have never
read Marx, his predecessors, or his successors, this
does n.ot stop their endless and ignorant vitupera-
tions about the evils of the Communist scourge.

,But the injustice of the HUAC and the damage
that is being done to the human spirit by its opera‘-
‘tions does not seem to bother very many people.
The quest for freedom cannot possibly be pursued
in a country whose national heroes are adult cow-
boys and prize ﬁghters. Had Matt Dillon been

  
 

 

branded a Communist, the whole country woum
have gone to battle for him. Letters denouncing the
HUAC would have poured into. Washington, yet
every decent college professor could be imprisoned

for ﬁfty years and the citizenry of this country.

would nod their heads complacently and mutter
something like “What do I send my kids to school
for any way?” The truth is that we in this country
have lost our concern for intellectual freedom.

The fact that-we are rapidly losing our position
of world leadership should make us re-examine our
cultural mores. Perhaps a monster like the HUAC.
would never have arisen, were we. not so intellec-
tually incapable of evaluatingpolitical ideologies,
Right now weare very susceptible to any ideology
because of our ignorance and‘our Rotarian opti-
mism. _

If a persuasive speaker were on television and
wished to persuade his audience that Communism
was a good thing, he would have little difficulty in
doing so provided that he did not appear at the
same time as Maverick. .One of the results of oh:
intellectual sloppiness is our tendency to bifurcate
strictly between good and evil. At the moment we

"think that capitalism is good and Communism is

bad. We are easy prey for anyone to convince of
the opposite so long as we insist on maintaining
rigid polarities. ‘

It is very necessary for us to redeﬁne the term
human being. Te be human is not just to buy brand
name products, to mix palatable drinks, and to be
a good host at a party for well—adjusted people.
We are not machines or automatons. We are con-
scious of ourselves as finite questing individuals.

If the term human dignity has any meaning in
our time at all, in this most nihilistic of all cen-
tures, then one component of this complex term
must consist of the individual’s search for and
verbalization of his own unique vision of the world.
Insofar as the HUAC deters this search it has, no
place in a country which was founded on prin.
ciples designed to maintain and encourage this
quest. "If something is not done about the HUAC
we shall all awaken and ﬁnd ourselves slaves. The
kind of slavery which will endure will be the worst
possible kind. It will be self-imposed, se1f-main-
tained, and ultimately self-annihilating.

Growing Pains 

By Harriet Weimer
The cry of students for a common facilities
building now strikes some administrators as a
ridiculously, shortsighted extravanganza. This re-
action stems mainly from seeing Pitt, 1961, through

- a fog.

Pitt, 1961, is no longer just a commuter—schoo1
and “the dogmas of the quiet
pasts are inadequate for the
stormy present.” The embryo
campus life at Pitt can not grow
if the necessary facilities are not
provided. .

Within two years, when the
new dormitory stands compl.et_e,
the University hopes to house
approximately 3500 students, If
the institutional planning board
does not accommodate these stu-
dents with additional recreation-
al space, the damages occurring in the dorms during
the past year will be recalled in 1965 as only
misdameanors. A

The slow process of expansion in student facili-
ties may have discouraged administrators in the
student affairs area as much as students since the
attrition rate in that ﬁeld has increased noticeably.
Similar to the problem of obtaining competent ad-
ministrators, the unattractive and inadequate Stu-
dent Union will not serve as a magnet to draw or
hold out-of-state students in the next few years.

Why is the student’s idea of a common facilities
building so important? It seems that when a stu-
dent chooses a university‘, he picks the school which
he believes can satisfy both his vocational and avo-
cational goals. Of course, this type‘ of student is
the one whose goal is to gain a well-rounded edu-
cation, and since the University wants to produce
this type of student, we can assume that its goal
would coincide with that of the inspired student.

But the University’s plans do not contain a com-
mon facilities building which would have workshop
areas for theatre, vocal, fine arts, or hobby groups,
an auditorium capable of seating crowds equal to
the ones stuffed into the SU ballroom when Mal-
colm Muggeridge, Bennet Cerf and Aldous Huxley
lectured, and recreational areas for tennis or bridge
or chess. ' , .

Possibly the greatest advantage of such a build-
ing would be an easily accessible center where stu-
dent-union-dorm students and tuck-shop—commuter
students could mix, and by mixing, expose them-

 

me 

There is not one single building. on campus de-
signed for student uses pnly — abuilding which
could be a center forlevery avocational and voca-
tional interest, and would be the magnet which
would draw students to. it, thus consuming the
energy which recent student demonstrations showed
diverted to, ripping telephones off the walls, drop-
ping water balloons on pedestrians, and decorating
barren trees with toilet paper.

Although the student himself may be to blame
for some of these immature actions, the University
cannot shift the blame completely to the student
since it is their obligation to set a precedent.

Let us examine the lack of facilities provided
for Pitt students. The plight of the theatre groups
is obvious. The Pitt Players remind me of a band of
troubadors, carrying their scenery from one tempo-
rarily vacated auditorium to another. Although the
Stephen Foster Memorial is available for produc-
tions and some practices, it cannot be considered
their workshop since it must be available for
classes, seminars, faculty meetings and the Tuesday
Musical Club. This club is entitled to use the Me-
morialxtwo days a week since they paid for ap-
proximately one half the costs, directly and indi-
rectly, when the structure was raised in 1937.

The predicament of the Pitt Players is similar to
the vocal groups, and other organizations in need
of workshop area.

The inadequacy of facilities, however_, extends
beyond the realm of the workshops. Although the
SU ballroom can hold a moderate crowd when the
adjoining dining room is opened, it is impossible
to hear the speaker unless one sits near the lectern.
Also the limited space for recreational activity in
the SU is another problem area which will be in-
9"‘-‘E1-Villgly 3DI3a<1‘cnt as the number of dorm stu-
dents increases.

Realizing that the University is expanding in
so many directions at once, it is understandable
that some areas must be neglected or bypassed, in
order to attend to more pertinent areas.

But the relationship between similar vocational
interest which can be stress by having a center,
where various and similar interests merge, where
interaction not only provides recreation but in addi-
tion fosters a wider intellectual range, seems to be
a relationship which is a counterpart to academic
excellencc,. rather than a ridiculously, shortsighted
extravaganza. A common facilities building can be
only a recreational center to some students, but to
the majority it would be an educational center -

the type of center which ‘provides the solid founda-

V Win Predicted

_ Gutlirie Spins Cats Znrl Win

By Jim O’Bi-ien

Riding the crest of a two game
win streak, the Pitt baseball team
will entertain Indiana State and
West Virginia this afternoon and
tomorrow respectively at Leech
Farm.

No matter what prevails in these

' two games, both of which were

not originally scheduled for these
dates, it will require some doing
to match the scripts of last week
in which the Cats gained their first
two victories.
* =l¢

JIM SYLVIS
Hurts No-Hitter

N etters Defeat

California State

Continued strong play by the
doubles team of Joe Brown and
Jack Douglas and the vastly im-
proved work of Dave O’Loughlin
highlighted the tennis team’s vic-
tory over California State College,
7-2, at the Vulcan’s home grounds
on Saturday.

Brown and Douglas polished
off their opponents with cus-
tomary ease, 6-0, 6-0. Coach Bill
Summers proudly points out that,
“in the last four matches Brown
and Douglas have lost only ﬁve
games.” While ‘dropping those
ﬁve the unbeaten pair won 48
games.

Summers was equally happy
over the showing of O’Loughlin.
“Dave was vastly improved in
his showing Saturday as com-
pared to earlier performances. It’s
only a matter of experience be-

.fore he became an outstanding

player.” The Cat's number two
man won over a tough opponent,
Frank Bishop, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
Douglas remained the netters
only unbeaten singles player by
posting a 6-1. 6-3 win over Ed
Nicholanco. Brown, Paul Koch-
man and Roger Glaser kept their
records at a pace with the
' teams’, 6-1, by posting triumphs.

Coach Summers did a bit of ex-
perimenting when he inserted
Glaser, instead of O’Loughlin, to
team with Ralph Mason. The two
worked well together in scoring
a 6-3, 6-4 win.

The Panthers’ only losses were
suffered by Mason and the
doubles pair of Kochman and Ted
Martens. It was the first loss of
the season for this twosome.

Coach Bobby Lewis was deeply
concerned about the effectiveness
of his pitching corps, but his woes
have been softened by two out-
standing efforts by Lauren Guthrie
and-Jim Sylvis.

Pitcher‘s Duel ,

The latter, an unknown from
Carrick High where there is not
even a baseball team, ﬁred a
sparkling no-hitter against Clarion
in a'1-0 pitcher’s duel in his ﬁrst
start for Lewis last Friday.

Sylvis, known as “Sponge” by
his mates, mopped up th e
enemy at Lewis’ pre-game re-
quest for an “impress me” per-
formance. After his stingy nine-
inning stint, he asked his coach,
“Well, was I impressive
enough?” ‘

He had to be imp1'essiVe. how-
ever, for his hurling counterpart,
Dan Tapolski allowed the Panthers
only one run, and it was unearned.
Tapolski shutout Pitt last year,
and over two seasons he hasn’t_
allowed an earned run in a 6-0
win report card.

, Gives Four Hits

Though not quite as spectacular,
squash player Lauren Guthrie
struck out eight Duquesne batters
and limited the Blufﬁtes to four
hits in gaining a slipshod 11-2

3’ victory on Thursday. The Dukes

committed a total of eight errors.
Lewis felt that Sylvis’ feat
was “one of the greatest thrills
that I’ll ever have as a coach.”
It was. the ﬁrst no-hitter that
_ any of his proteges ever re-
corded. .

The two toughest defensive
plays of the day were both exe-
cuted by Sylvis. He had to move
like lightning to retire two run-
ners on slow dribblers down the
baselines. On the ﬁnal out, he fell
ﬁelding a grounder, and tossed the
ball for the ﬁnal out on his knees.

“Praying for a no-hitter,” Lewis
kidded.

Golfers Drop W80]
But Tie Moimlies
In Weekend Meet

Pitt’s golf team battled West
Virginia to a deadlock for the
third straight time and crushed
Washington & Jefferson. 151/2-21/2,
at Vllildwood Golf Club, Satur-
day.

Despite the fact that they lost
four of six matches to the
Mountaineers, the Panthers were
still able to come up with the 9-9
tie mainly on the ﬁne play of
Stew Snodgrass and Ron Der-
mitt who shut out their oppo-
nents, 3-0. All other Panthers,
with the exception of Denny
Peters, lost 2-1.

Skyscraper U. won all their
matches against_the Presidents.
Dermitt, Peters and Dan Swan-
son scored 3-O wins in the easy
triumph.

Snodgrass continued as the
Cat's outstanding player by once
again posting the low score of
the day, a par 72. Dermitt was
second with a 74.

Jim Hess led the Mounties with
a 75. The Prexies' low man was
Tom I-Iefflin, who had a 76.

The win and tie pushed
linxmen a little closer to the

the
.500

*mark with a 4-6-1 record.

’em.

Prior to Saturday’s track
meet _with l/Vest Virginia,
Coach Carl Rees predicted an

easy win. The Mountaineers
on the other hand were unde-
feated and looked for the first
win over the Panthers in 28 years.
But again the Cats proved to be
too much for the Mountaineers
as they dumped them 81-50.

Although the Panthers only led
by one point, 5-4, after the first
event, the mile won by Bob Tark-
any in 4:28.01, a sweep in the
440-yard run indicated the Pan-
ther’s superior strength.

Bill Hinchberger, team co-cap-
tain, won the event in 50.3, not
bad’ considering the soggy track
conditions at the Stadium. He was
followed by Steve Munter and
Vance Carter.

Hinchberger’s win was of
further encouragement to the
Panthers, for it was the ﬁrst meet
in which he had won a race. He
came back to win the 880 in
2:0l..1. '

Pitt had four double, winners
Saturday afternoon, along with
Hinchberg. Tarkany who cap-
tured the mile, won the two-
mile in 10:05. Bob Shanafelt
won the .100-yard dash in 10.1
seconds and took the 220 in 2.2.2.

The other double winner for
the Panthers came in the weight
division. Dan Kanell, who usually
performs consistant with the com-
petition, that is if the competition
is rough, he is also, took the discus
and shotput.

Then Gets Married

Kanell threw the discus 154’
71%;”, and the shot 52 feet and 3/;
inches. After the track meet the
6-5 co-captain was married in
Dormont.

Although the Panthers were ex- A

pected to be blanked in ’thejave-
lin, a spear thrower from Kenya,
Okoth Hannington, took second

place with a toss of 176 feet 1

BOB SHANAFELT got off to a fast start. to take first place in the

Review Sees MacDonald

Book as Skillful Satire

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

It was on the suggestion of an English instructor, with
whom I happened to bump brows while browsing in the
Pitt Book Center, that I delved into P~arodies—-An Anthology
From Chaucer to Beerbohm-—‘And After (Edited by Dwight

. MacDonald; Random House; 574 pp.; $7.50).

‘ While highly entertaining, the book is, _if the term may

be excused, educational. The col-9

lection was designed in a schol-
arly fashion, but this does not
sublimate any of the power of the
essays; the satire, the bite, the
dig,‘ the kick-in-the-shins Awhich
is inherent in that unique literary
form, the parody. The reader sees
the gods of letters, old and new,
painfully plucked, from their
pedestals by other literary rul-
ers, old and new. The ideas, as
well as the styles, of a myriad of
writers are mercilessly dynamited
and, in most cases, rightfully so.
Consists of Satirization

A variety of this pillage by
parody has been assembled by
Macdonald. The major portion of
the book consists of great writers
satirizing great writers: Pope on
Chaucer, Shakespeare on Lyly,
Byron on Wordsworth, Beerbohm
on James. It is interesting, almost
exciting, to see which writers at-
tack which, and to see if they are
doing it in‘ anger, in fun, in-
juriously or indiscriminately.

Then a good many pages are

devoted to essays from “A
Christmas Garland” by “The
Incomparable Max.” But Beer-

bohm, although broiling such

greats as Kipling and Hardy to

a juicy turn, almost to the point

of burning‘ the beef, has his

hands quite full proving that
he is incomparable in company
of such other expert chefs.

_The Moderns do not escape be-
ing dragged over the literary
grill, either. A nonentity named
Arthur Flegenheimer treats Gert-

rose is really a rose is really a

Allen Ginsberg are Howlingly

rhetoric by John Updike and
Louis Simpson, respectively (but
not respectfully).

Probes Literary Patterns

As the last main section of the
anthology, editor Macdonald has
compiled what he calls “Special-
ties.” ’Here, literary, patterns, as

dwell as people, are probed. The

late Ring Lardner presents a
spleen-splitting triad of ultra-
modern playlets in which, at one
point, “the curtain is..1owered for
seven days to denote the lapse
of a week.”

One last curious category re- .

mains. This is what Macdonald
has titled “Self-Parodies: Con-
scious and Unconscious.” In this
book, but in no other. Poe, By-
ron, Dickens, Whitman and
others are seen semantically
making fools out of themselves,
by trying too hard and not

‘ thinking enough.

As a result of this comprehen-
sive study, highlighted by excel-
lent notes and preface by the

-editor, the reader is left with the

impression that “to err is human,
to forgive is a matter of choice.”
Bu.t due to the skills of both the
editor and the authors, the col-
lection also has assmuch schol-
astic worth as many literature
text-books, as much entertain-
ment as the Complete Works of
Everybody, and as much literary
value as, for instartce, Milton’s
“Parodies Lost.”

Two approaches to the

“man’s deodorant?’ problem

If a man doesn't mind shaving under his arms, he will probably
find a woman's roll~on satisfactory. Most men. however. find it
simpler and surer to use Mennen Spray Deodorant. Mennen Spray
was made to get through to the skin, where perspiration starts.
And made to work all day. More men use Mennen Spray than any

other deodorant. How about you?
