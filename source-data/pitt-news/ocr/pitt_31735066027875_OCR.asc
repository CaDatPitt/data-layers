CGS council member inquires into
allegations of election tampering

 

In a meeting full of political
intrigue, a College of General Studies
council member stunned her col-
leagues by requesting a public hearing
into allegations of election tampering
Monday night.

“I want to know -— I want all the
students to know —— were the elections
tampered with?" asked council mem-
ber Linda Messineo.

Such controversy is nothing new
to the embroiled CGS council.

The charge of election tampering
stems from a long-running debate
among members about how to best
serve their constituents.

President Erika Nanz and Vice
President Marjorie Carlson, neither of
whom attended Monday’s meeting,
favor dissolving the CGS Student
Government Council. Both prefer res-
urrecting it as a governance group

under the non-CGS Student
Government Board.
Other members, notably

Messineo, have expressed concern

Honor pledge passes Senate
Students say ”Pitt Promise" is just publicity ploy

Melissa Blackwood

 

The University of Virginia has an
honor code.

The University of South Carolina
has the “Carolinian Creed.”

Now this University has the “Pitt
Promise.”

Yesterday, the University Senate
Council became the latest University
organization to endorse this new code
of ethics for students.

“The Pitt Promise: A Commitment
to Civility” is a series of pledges to

 

and maintain academic integrity.

Although no students will be
required to make this pledge, Robert
Gallagher, interim vice chancellor for
student affairs, hopes to incorporate
the Pitt Promise into University events
such as the freshmen convocation.

“It’s really meant to make our
value expectations clear to students
from the beginning,” said Gallagher,
author of the pledge.

“There are no penalties or any-
thing to make this binding, but we
hope it will be a call to think about our
differences within the University com-

saying they feel rushed to make a deci-

Moving forward: A rape victim recounts her experiences

Anne E

stonillo
   V  i  V I

 

Thirteen years after her rape at
age 18, her words are selected with
the care of one who has spent many
nights reflecting.

Her rapist was someone she
knew. He was the best friend of her
roommate’s boyfriend. It was the
summertime in Pittsburgh, and she
had just gotten her first apartment
with two of her friends.

“It was a long time ago. Which
makes it harder and harder to tell
the story because time really does
heal all wounds,” she says.

I’m seated across from her as
she begins. She asks if I’ll use her
name, and I offer her the choice.
We decide no. Though she’s not

5 partial to anonymity, she’s cautious

about how her story is used.
“I was pretty wild at that time.

 

We had a lot of parties that sum-
mer,” she says.

Comfortably dressed in her but-
ton-down and jeans, her face is free
of any traces of

makeup. She
looks no older
than 21, but
wisdom etches
her face, and
e x p e r i e n c e
hangs on her

like a backpack
full of her life as
a student.

“This was
someone I was
attracted to. I
was interested in dating perhaps,”
she says.

She is painfully honest with her
story. I shift in discomfort because
of my conscience as I wonder
whether I would express the same

"It was a long time
ago. Which makes
it harder and
harder to tell the
story because time
really does heal
all wounds."

facts if I were the victim.

The bright afternoon sun shines
through the windows of the Lillian
Russell Conference Room in the
student union.
Her eyes wan-
der, to look at
the window, and
then to the
glass-covered
table before her,
where both her
face and mine
are reflected.

“At one
point during the
summer, at one
of our parties, I
had gotten very drunk and passed
out, and he had sex with me while I
was passed out,” she says. “I found
out about that because my room-
mate had walked in on it, and the
next morning I could tell that

something had happened.”

She says she blamed herself for
the incident and was confused. It
did not occur to her at the time that
it was a crime. She told her friends
what had happened and asked that
they not allow him into the apart-
ment anymore.

A few weeks later — at another
party in her apartment —— her
assaulter showed up again. At the
party, he approached her and asked
if she would talk about what had
happened.

He explained that he had just
moved down the street from her
and that he wanted to apologize.
The party had run out of cups and
he offered to get some in his apart-
ment. He said he would show her
his new place while they talked.

“I wasn't drinking too much
that night because the party was

Air Force loses jet and
four 500-pouncl bombs

Around the World

BRISBANE, Australia — Some
Marines may be in trouble in Australia.
The Marine Corps is investigating accu-
sations of excessive force by American
military police involved in the arrest of
several aborigines.

A civil—rights group accused the
Queensland Police and the Marine mili-
tary police of punching and kicking the
aborigines. Security cameras captured
the March 22, 1997 scufﬂe on tape.

A spokesman for the Navy’s 7th
Fleet conﬁrms the Marine MPs were on
patrol with the local police. He said there
will be full cooperation with the
Australian investigation into this matter.

The U.S. military personnel were
in Australia as part of a joint exercise.

Across the Nation

TUCSON, Ar. — The search for a miss-
ing Air Force attack jet has been centered
on a snowbound central Colorado moun-
tain.

Using a U-2 reconnaissance plane,
radar, and tips from the public, searchers
have honed in on a three—and-a—half—
square—mi1e area. It is believed that the
A-10 “Warthog” aircraft may be buried
in the snow. ,

The 33-year-old captain of the
plane, Craig Button, and the plane dis-

appeared during a training exercise 5

over Arizona six days ago. The aircraft
was carrying four 500—pound bombs.

NOTASULGA, Al. —— The survivors of

the Tuskegee, Alabama, syphilis study
want an apology from President Clinton.

The U.S. Public Health Service con-
ducted. the study, tracking the progres-
sion of syphilis in black males starting in
the 1940s. During the study, more than
600 black men went untreated for the
deadly disease, even after it was found
that antibiotics were an effective treat-
ment.

Field Gray, an attorney for the group,
says 14 of the participants are still alive.
He says there has never been any expres-
sion of remorse or guilt by the federal
government, and he noted that Clinton
has issued an apology to Cold War-era
radiation experiments.

Regional — Rivers continue to rise
across the northern plains, and the worst
of the ﬂooding may be yet to come.

Along the Red River, which sepa-
rates Minnesota from North Dakota, the
worst overﬂow from snowmelt is expect-
ed on Thursday and Friday. Experts have
speculated that this may be a ﬂood of his-
tone proportions.

In central Minnesota, ﬂood warnings
are posted for the next two weeks along
parts of the three rivers: the Minnesota,
Mississippi, and the St. Croix.

Making matters worse for sandbag-
ging crews are the frigid cold and blister-
ing wind. Flooded fields are now sheets
of ice.

ery efforts.

munity,” he added.

Gallagher says both UVA and USC
report a positive improvement in the
campus climate because of their honor
codes.

Reaction to the Pitt Promise from
students has been mixed.

While many say they support the
idea of personal responsibility without
any mechanism to enforce it, some
think the Pitt Promise lacks substance.

“I guess it will make some people
more aware, but I don’t think it’s going
to change anything,” said freshman
Chrissy Lukoski.

Freshman Kevin Oprishko agreed.
“It’s a good idea, but the student body
isn’t going to pay attention,” he said.

Other students see it as a public-
relations ploy by the University.

“They write stuff like this because
it looks good, but I don’t think they
really mean it,” said senior Jason
Chavis. “They have to do something to
back it up.”

The Pitt Promise has been endorsed
by all three major student organizations
on campus: Student Government
Board, the College of General Studies
Student Government Council, and the
Graduate and Professional Student
Association.

The SGB plans to officially recite it
for the first time at a student—organiza—
tion recognition dinner Sunday night.

“These groups, these students,

these faculty members really exemplify
the principles of the Pitt Promise, so we
thought this would be a wonderful way
to introduce it to students,” said board
member Brandi Miller.

As it was endorsed by the Senate
Council, the Pitt Promise applies only
to students on the Oakland campus.
Gallagher, however, hopes to extend it
soon to cover all members of the
University community.

“When I wrote the first draft, it was
directed to Pitt students, but as it
evolved, it seemed to have broader
implications,” said Gallagher.

Professor Lee Weinberg, head of
the Administration of Justice program,
abstained from yesterday’s vote and
agreed that the Pitt Promise should
cover faculty members as well as stu-
dents.

“It seems to me we’re saying, ‘You
guys be civil, we’l1 worry about us
later,”’
bers.

Students at branch campuses and
faculty members were excluded from
yesterday’s endorsement because nei-
ther group has yet seen the Pitt
Promise.

Senate President Keith McDuffie
said he hopes to bring the pledge to the
Faculty Assembly soon, and student
leaders have already promised to send
copies to their counterparts at branch
campuses.

* dissolution.

The two sides finally agreed to

‘compromise last month by forming a

restructuring committee to study their
options.
In the meantime, however, allega-

i tions were made that a current council
‘ member tampered with elections by

approaching a candidate for next year’s

' council and asking him to support its

dissolution.
Neither the suspected council
member nor the candidate were identi-

. fied.

“None of us have the right to tam-
per with this council, particularly elect-
ed officials. We took an oath of office,”
Messineo reminded her fellow council

‘ members.

“I am accusing no one at this
point,” she added. “I want a public

I hearing so it all comes out in the open.”

Council member Paul Miller sup-
ported Messineo’s position.

“Even if it’s a perceived question
of ethics, if we’re not perceived as eth-
ical, nothing else matters,” Miller said.

“It’s pretty much hearsay,”
responded Stephen Grivnow, Director
of Judicial Affairs.

“I have interviewed both parties
involved  It is up to my discretion to

 

 

FROM PAGE I 

hold a malfeasance hearing, and my
position on this is there is insufficient
evidence to hold a hearing at this time,”
he said.

Grivnow did agree, though, to
research CGS council by—laws to find
out if Messineo has the authority to
request a hearing over his objections.

If she does, a public hearing would
have to be held by the end of the semes-
ter.

On Monday, Messineo also criti-
cized recent expenditures and planned
expenditures to send council members
to conferences in Texas and
Washington, D.C.

“I think at least $5,000 was of no
benefit to our students, and it bothers
me. I don’t mind saying that,” she com-
plained.

Council member Eric Ondos
agreed. “I have seen no benefits from
the Texas trip  And the D. C. trip, it’s
very fortunate that that money was not
spent,” he said.

Messineo defended her decision to
raise these issues at one of the last
council meetings of the year.

“When we started this council, we
had a clean slate. We did not inherit a
legacy from the last council,” she said.
“We owe it to the next council to
resolve these issues.”

that despite what he

her in the arm and on her breast.
She says that at the time it didn’t
occur to her to scream. His, grand-
mother lived in the apartment below
him.

“But it was just him and me, and .

It didn’t occur to me that anyone
other than me could get me out of
this situation,” she
says. “Realistically, I
didn’t think he was
going to kill me. Ijust
thought, he’s going to
beat the crap out of me,
and he’s going to get
what he wants.”

He grabbed a beer
bottle, which he swung
at her face over and
over again. She contin-
ued to talk to him
because she couldn’t
fight back. She says
she thought he would
lose his erection even-
tually, and that she
would get away.

“I was saying, ‘This is rape,’
and he said, ‘This is great. This is
great. This is my first rape  Ijust
want to get my rocks off, and you
can leave,”’ she quotes him as say-
ing. “Finally, I just went limp. I
really believed at that point that I
wasn’t getting out of that apartment
without him getting what he want-
ed.”

He raped her. And when he was
done, he rolled off her and told her
she could go.

She then says, “The buttons of
my shirt had all popped off. They
were all over the floor. I remember
he was picking up the buttons, and
he handed them to me as I was
standing at the door. I threw them
back at him and said, ‘I’ll see you in
court.”’

She has her hands raised, and
she’s leaning forward looking at me.

“This time I was not confused,”
she says. “The first time I had

blamed.myself for allowing myself
to be that drunk. This time I was
very clear that I had not consented
to this.”

“I had not played a role in it. He
knew what he was doing, and I
knew what I was doing. This had
been a rape.”

She was taken to the hospital by
her girlfriend and reported the rape
that night. She says her friends had
a mixed reaction to the rape. The
woman’s friend told the victim’s
parents about the rape, even though
the victim had not wanted them to
know. She says it should have been
her decision to disclose the informa-
tion. ~

“A lot of people start taking
over and thinking they know what’s
best for you,” she says.

Her rapist was not arrested that
night. She says she wishes the
police had done so because they
would have found the buttons she
had thrown back at him.

“I did have the bite mark on my
arm, and I had some scrapes, and
they took pictures of
that,” she says.
“When the detectives
came into interview
me the next day at
the Center for
Victims [of Violent
Crime], I heard them
saying, ‘So where’s

the girl who was
raped by her
boyfriend?’

“I just thought,
great, he is not my
boyfriend. And even
if he was, it was such
a discounting of what
had happened. But
they came around
eventually.”

The police interviewed her that
day and then again a week later. She
says they called her and asked her to
come to the station because they
needed her right away.

She says this may have been the
pol-ice’s way of talking to her with-
out her support system and the
advocates at the Center for Victims
of Violent Crime being present.
They talked to her for hours before
finally concluding that she had a
case.

“They said, ‘You know, we
believe that if you had wanted to

have sex with this guy, you would .

997

have had sex with this guy, she
says with her air of honesty. “I was
definitely at a very wild stage in my
life. I was drinking a lot. I was
sleeping with a lot of men, and I
didn’t accuse any of them of rape.”

Her rapist was arrested, and the
day before the trial she was offered
a plea bargain down to simple
assault —— her rapist would plead
guilty of hitting her if she dropped
the rape and indecent-assault
charges, but he wouldn’t do any jail
time.

At this point, she says she really
struggled with the decision. Her
mother wanted her to take the plea
bargain, but her father
wanted her to persist
with the rape charges.

She attributes much
of her support in this
decision to the Center
for Victims of Violent
Crime because her
advocate provided
unconditional support
without having an
agenda.

“I decided that sim-
ple assault wouldn’t
cut it,” she says.
“That’s what you get
in a barroom brawl. It
just didn’t capture
what he did. I wanted
him labeled as a sexual offender. I
wanted him in prison.”

But her rapist was acquitted.
She was devastated.

“I really believed that there was
no way that a jury was going to look

at these pictures and, decide that
there wasn’t at least a simple
assault,” she says.

She was told from the beginning
that cases like hers were difficult to
win.
“But I believed that if I told the
truth and I admitted the things that I
wasn’t proud Of,  ........................................... ..
they would see that I
was telling the truth,”
she says.

Her attacker had
his rabbi testify, and
his employer said he
was never late. A
judge . who was
friends with his fami-
ly testified on his
behalf also.

“People have an
idea of what a rapist
is, and he did not fit
into it,” she says.
“This was a nice
Jewish boy from a
wealthy family.

“Other women I’ve gone to high
school with came up to me and said,
‘You know, he raped me too.’ But
none of them had ever done any-
thing about it.”

We’ve talked for nearlyan hour,
and her face looks tired. I have
exhausted my questions and am torn
between anger against the system
and being objective with my
thoughts.

There is more to her story. She
blamed herself for being someone a
jury couldn’t believe.

“I blamed myself for using the
drugs and for all the things that
made me not a credible witness,”
she says. “I started doing a lot of
really self-destructive stuff. I just
felt so totally devalued that not only
could somebody do this, but that
they could do this and 12 people
would say that it was okay. I felt

really worthless, and I started to.

treat myself like I was worthless.”
She looks out the window,

recalling how the rest of that sum-
mer went for her. Her voice cracks,
maybe from talking for so long, or
maybe from the burden of recount-
ing her struggle.

She started drinking so heavily
it became apparent that she was an
alcoholic After finally going to
counseling to work
through these issues,
she returned to
school. .

“I was so angry, and
I believe that anger
really hurt me
because I don’t think
society is ready for
rape victims to be
angry,” she says.

Her hands are ani-
mated, as if she’s
drawing her words
from the air.

“I think they want us
to fall apart, and they
want us to cry, and
that’s what they’re expecting, and
they’re not ready to hear you when
you stand up and you say, ‘I am
pissed that this happened.”’

In the past few years, she has
done a lot of work toward conquer-
ing her anger. After finishing
school, she worked actively to edu-
cate the public about sexual-assault
awareness.

She has been sober six years and
is getting ready to marry. It is clear
she has come to terms with the
assault. She is currently working
toward aedegree that will allow her

to play a more active role in the

conviction of sex offenders.

_“You never forget that it hap-
pened to you,” she says. “I really
want people to know, particularly
people who have been recently
assaulted, that you do get through it.

“And life is good again. And my
life is better now than it was right
before the assault. You always have
the scars, but scars are signs of
healed wounds.”

Dickheads, yinzers, & the K00 Klutz who?

 

Yes, another message from
me, your official dickhead alert
system! I’m sorry to have to keep
harping about this, but I do feel,
as an honorary (by virtue of long
tenure) American and a colu1n-
nist, that I have a certain duty to
point out the ﬂaws in American
society. (Please, don’t all rush at
once to thank me. I accept bou-
quets on Sundays from 9 a.m. to
9:05 a.m. only.)

Of course, the University
community does not need to be
reminded of the fact that groups
like the Ku Klux Klan are com-
plete nutters functioning on too
much testosterone and too few
brain cells and deserve to be
shunned. All the hallmarks of

"complete dickheadedness are

there — the emperor’s old (very
old) clothes are full of holes, and
so is their logic. My point is, why
bother arguing with such idiots?
The City of Pittsburgh (i.e., you
and me) has an $80,000 bill for

0 security for these handkerchief-

headed fools, and all the time
nobody thought of the simple
solution. Don’t go! Yeah, that
means The Pitt News and
Channel 11 and all the rest of you
“newshounds.” What the heck,
you knew what they were going
to say. Who cares?

I don’t know if you’ve
noticed, but by and large, people
who preach some highly speciﬁc
(i.e., narrow) viewpoint which
consists of sharply delineated
black-and-white distinctions are
usually crackpots. Beware of
“always” and “never.” Human
nature is not so easily deﬁned, I
fear. Perhaps this is the real basis
of extremist groups like the Klan

and the Heaven’s Gate cultists.
They are not motivated so much
by hate, love, or Nikes, but rather
by the perennial American desire
to reduce everything to a simple
solution. Let’s hate black people;
there’s a good one. That’ll
straighten everything out. Life?
Oh, no thanks, not for me. I’m
trying to quit. Let’s build a space-
ship out of old tires and then kill
ourselves. Much better idea, nice
and simple.

It isn’t hard to trace the roots
of America’s love affair with
simplicity. Choices like working
the land or starving and building
a house or being eaten by preda-
tors were the original American
choices. Hey, you could’ve just
stayed in Europe and kissed
some more imperialist ass, you
know. But no — Americans
chose to come and hack some-
thing out of the wilderness. It
was back to nature, it was start-
ing from scratch, it was hard
work, but the purpose was sim-
ple. When the purpose is so clear
and simple, work, however hard,
is satisfying. Americans will
probably always be in love with
this idea. And who can blame
them? They’ve built the modern
world with it. (Thanks, some of
us preferred the old one, but
never mind.)

Americans often think they
rule the world, and they are not
shy about the strategy of reduc-
ing technical problems to their
component parts and proﬁting
thereby. From Model—T Fords to
Maytags, America works.
However, this same strategy
doesn’t work for the Big
Questions. There is no Big
Answer. Of course, nobody but
the stupid and shallow would
attempt to reduce ethics, morals,

and philosophy to a single
premise — such as “ ethnic
group is the cause of all our prob-
lerns, so let’s kill them.” Point.

By deﬁnition, then, arguing
with the shallow and stupid is
pointless. Thus, shun them,
ignore them, turn the other
cheek. The Klan are losers,
they’re at least 100 years out of
date, and they (or their equiva-
lent) will probably always be
around in some form or another.
Oh, well, such is life.
Furthermore, they wear unutter—
ably silly clothes and talk twad-
dle. I think the best message to
send to them is to simply ignore
them. Don’t rush off to protest;
that’s what they want. Just say,
the Koo Klutz who? Ignoring
people is often the best possible
way to insult them. The best part
is, they can’t ﬁgure out if they’ve
been insulted or not! I love that
part.
One of my boyfriends of
long ago worked for a small busi-
ness—systems company named
Kalamazoo. At the time, my dad
worked for Lamson Industries,
then the leader in business sys-
tems. During the course of dinner
one night, Kevin, attempting to
make conversation with my dad
(always an uphill struggle during
dinner), noted ingratiatingly that
Kalamazoo “regarded Lamson as
a business rival.” My dad looked
up brieﬂy from communing with
his dinner, and said shortly, “Oh.
We don’t regard your company.”
My dad didn’t mean to be rude,
he was just stating a fact. Kevin
was completely crushed. Another
one bites the dust.

Piﬂ win-man
may lose big
on this one

 

 

According to reports from everybody
except Mark Blount, Mark Blount is set to
leave the University of Pittsburgh.

He will move on to bigger and better
things. He will take his skills to the NBA.

More accurately, he will take his height
to the NBA.

As one of very few 7-footers who can
walk without tripping, Blount has always
been a possible entrant in the NBAdraft The
original plan was for him to stay with the
Panthers, develop as a basketball player, play
for some winning teams, and then make the
jump.

Pitt coaches have always considered
him a four-year project Blount, either on his
own or on the advice of
guardians/parents/agents/etc., has decided
that this development period is twice as long
as necessary.

He has a point. Compare his play this
season to his limited action last year, and
Blount has become a shot-blocking,
rebound-grabbing machine. He even led the
team in scoring every so often.

But that doesn’t make him ready for
NBA stardom. In all likelihood, the Panther
sophomore will get drafted late in the second
round, play in a few summer leagues in an
attempt to polish his game, and promptly get
cut.

If not, he’ll make the NBA as a backup,
have no chance to showcase his wares or
improve his game, and ride the bench for a
number of seasons. Then, it’s off to the CBA,
if he’s lucky.

Sounds like the makings of a wonderful,
proﬁtable basketball experience. If that’s his
decision, then I wish him all the best of luck.

Hopefully, that won’t be his decision.
Blount is a raw talent with raw height and
raw shot-blocking ability —— good enough to
get him into the NBA as a work-in-progress,
but not good enough to help him stay there.
Staying here is the only way he can

Hoffman & the Gang pay sweet music

One of them is a junior, the
other is a freshman. One is
from Florida, the other is from
New York. One is  well, those
are about the only things that
Pitt’s Amanda Hoffman and
Beth Gang don’t have in com-
mon. _

The two share a love of
‘80s movies, hanging out
together, eating out, and, oh
yeah, they both lead Pitt’s ten-
nis team with IS singles wins.

Hoffman, a West Palm
Beach, Fla, native, and Gang,
who hails from the East
Norwich suburb of Long
Island, have battled neck-and-
neck for the team lead in victo-
ries since the fall season, when
both recorded eight wins.

‘They both have steadily
improved this year,” said Head
Coach George Dieffenbach.
“They’ve worked hard on their
ﬁmdamentals and have used
the fundamentals in pressure
matches.”

“They both respond well
to coaching.”

While some athletes in
their situation might let their
competitiveness ruin their rela-

tionship, Hoffman and Gang
have used it to help each other
on the court.

“During matches, we
motivate each other and give

each other advice,” said
Hoffman.

They also use it to moti-
vate themselves.

During last week’s CMU
match, Hoffman noticed Gang
walking off the court during her
match.

“I knew she won and I
thought, I can’t let her get one
up on me,” said Hoffman.

Hoﬁman and Gang came
to Pitt this year via nationally
ranked Palm Beach
Community College and
Oyster Bay High School,
respectively, because of their
impression of Pitt during
recruiting visits.

“I came up during the
summer and liked it,” said
Hoffman, who didn’t realize at
the time that Pittsburgh’s
weather is a little different in
the winter. “Little did I know.”

“I liked the coach and the
team and the big—school atmos-
phere,” said Gang, who grew
up attending Broadway shows,
Knicks games, and the U.S.
Open in New York City.

Hoffman and Gang were

Freshman diver makes a splash

aft Townsend

Ten minutes before her ﬁnal
dive in the high school state
championships of her senior
year, Pitt freshman Jamie
Tomazich relaxes poolside with
one of her teammates and talks
about guys, or anything except
the upcoming plunge. She then
climbs onto the one—meter
springboard and prepares for her
catapult into the sauna-like air of
the indoor Penn State pool.

She repeats to herself men-
tally, “Keep your head in line
and look at your spots.”

She explodes off the board
and a few moments later, head-
ﬁrst into the pool. The dive is
good enough to seal her three-
peat as state champ in women’s
diving.

“I do much better in diving
when I leave it up to my
instincts. I don’t like to over-
think things. I just have fun and
don’t think about it,” said
Tomazich.

The pressures of coming to

 

Pitt as a highly—touted athlete
and the expectation of filling the
shoes of one Pitt’s most success-
ful divers, Sunday
Lewandowski, hasn’t hampered
Tomazich’s success in the sport.
"lhere is more pressure on
me here than in high school.
With Sunday gone, it kind of
falls on my shoulders. I’m not
Sunday. I’m me. I can only do
what I can, and that’s all I or
anyone can expect,” said
Tomazich.
Her first taste of athletics
began as a hyper‘ 3-year-old,
somersaulting and cartwheeling
away in the local tumbling class.
The tumbling was fun, so she
joined a gymnastics gym and
began training at age six.
Tomazich’s mother, Cindy,
knew that Jamie was destined to
be a diver at an early age.
“Sometimes we would hold
her upside down to discipline
her, and all she would do is
laugh, because she loved it.”
Tomazich admits,”When
I’m upside down, I’m more
comfortable and coordinated.”

 

Injuries and a loss of interest
set back her gymnastics career.
She ﬁnally quit the sport in the
sixth grade.

“Gymnastics was too hard
on my body. I broke six bones
before I ﬁnally decided to quit,”
said Tomazich. “It was hard to
quit because it was the only
thing I knew. I would go to
school and then eat and do
homework on the way to the
gym, and then come home and
go to sleep.”

After gyrrmastics, Tomazich
was a cheerleader for a year.
Cheerleading has the ﬂips and
jumps that gymnastics did, but
the whole team concept wasn’t
appealing.

“I’m terrible at team sports
because I’m not a good competi-
tor. ldon’t get all ﬁred up to win.
I don’t have a burning desire to
crush somebody else or see
them wince in pain,” said
Tomazich.

In the eighth grade, she
started diving and discovered a
sport she truly loved.

THE PITT NEWS

Men's rugby gets solid senior leadership

alrick Robertson

The Pitt men’s rugby team is losing three seniors
this year. All three have played for the team the last
four years and are huge contributors on this year’s
team.
Rob Mailliard signed up his freshman year for
no particular reason and has become the captain of
this year’s team. He said it did not take him that long
to adjust to the game. He was ready to play by the
first game but did not really have a firm grasp of the
rules.

He has learned to enjoy the game more now
since he understands the 111168. He began his career
as a loose prop, which is a forward, and still plays
there this season.

This year, Mailliard believes, has been his best
year of the four. He has developed over the last four

_ years into a strong forward.

Senior Sean Tonkin called him a “good leader.”
Jeff Derda said, “He leads by example.”

Tonkin said that Mailliard does a lot of the
administrative work for the team, which is his
biggest asset off the ﬁeld, according to Tonkin.
Tonkin also said that Mailliard sacriﬁces himself on
and off the ﬁeld by doing all that he can to help the
team.

Derda is the second of the graduating trio. He
has also played for four years, but his first season
barely came about.

He went to the Freshman Activities Fair in
Forbes Quad and signed up for rugby, lacrosse, and
crew. As it turned out, rugby was the only sport that
ﬁt into Derda’s schedule.

Derda played football in high school but had no

 

clue about the rules of rugby when he started. He
said it took him one or two years to get a grasp of the
rules. Derda plays the 8 man, who is the last man in
the scrum.

He started in the back line and moved quickly
into the pack before finally moving to 8 man.

Derda said the switch from back to forward was
tougher than that from pack to 8 man. He compared
this to moving from the inﬁeld to the outfield in
baseball.

Tonkin said, “He is not always in shape, but he
always works his butt off. He always gives his best
for the team.”

Tonkin is the third senior. He came in with an
advantage over the rest of the freshmen because he
came from South Africa, where he played rugby in
high school. He thus knew the rules of the game very
well.

He took it upon himself to try to help the others
to learn the rules. Of these three, Tonkin was the only
player to start his career playing for the “A” side.

The biggest problem that Tonkin encountered
was that the American game is more physical than
South Africa’s and that he was not quite big enough.
It took him all four years to get to the point where he
wanted to be.

As a freshman, Tonkin played fullback and con-
tinued there for three years. Now he has taken on the
role of ﬂy half. He calls the plays as would a defen-
sive captain in football.

This year, he hasn’t had much of a problem
adjusting. He put on a little more weight, which has
helped him to be less nervous and have his best year
offensively.

S These seniors only have one more home game,
the Alumni Game, on April 19.

become a legitimate NBA player. .

First, as the starting center on a team without an experienced back-
up center, Blount should get about 30 minutes a game. He’ll have a
chance to dominate lesser opponents and test his skills against Big East
monsters. His shot-blocking totals should go through the roof. He’ll get
noticed by scouts, who, right now, aren’t climbing over each other to
sign him. i

Second, if football strength-and-conditioning coach Buddy
Morris will lend a hand, Blount can put on some muscle. A thin 7-foot-
er can play well in the college game, but will likely meet his match in

- the professional ranks against 320-pound monsters and 7-6 stickmen

like Shawn Bradley.

Third, if Blount and the rumored-to-transfer Isaac Hawkins stay
put, this team has a chance at an NCAA Tournament appearance next
season. A semiﬁnal appearance in the Big East tomney and/or the NIT
would be a lock and would translate into national exposure for the cen-
ter.

It would also translate into ﬁm for the fans. As much as we like to
seethelocalboymakegoodinthepros,we’dratl1erseehimstaya
local boy for a while. It was exciting to see Blormt emerge as a force
underthebackboardsthisseason—anditwouldbeashametosee
him on an NBA bench next year as the Panthers plummet to below
.500.

Finally, if not for next year, imagine what would happen if Blount,
Vonteego Cummings, Kellii Taylor, and Hawkins could stick around
for two more seasons?

A fully matured Blount would own the boards. Crunmings would
average over 20 points a game. Taylor would rewrite records for steals.
And if his rougliliousing in the Big East Tournament is any indication
of future play, Hawkins will either be the most feared man in the con-
ference or be on the FBI’s Most Wanted List.

It’s a fan’s dream. It’s a team that could, at the very least, earn us
a convocation center, if not a Big East title. Or more.

And Blount’s a key part of it.

At least, he could be.

1980s. Among their favorites are Sixteen
Candles, The Breakfast Club, Pret1y in
Pink, and Ferris Buelleris Day Ojf .

“I like ‘80s movies,” said a laughing
Hoffman, “anything with John Cusack and
Molly Ringwal .”

“I also like cheesy movies,” like Evil
Dead, The Exorcist, and Nightmare on Elm
Street. .”

The two like going out to eat together
and with the team. Their local favorites are
the Prince of India, Sito’s, and the Olive
Garden. But the team favorite is Hoss’s,
where a big deer head sits perched on a
wall.

“George always tells me [the deer’s]
staring down at me,” said Hoﬂ°man, a vege-
tarian who doesn’t wear wool sweaters and
is still searching for a satisfactory tennis
shoe made from anything but leather.

Another thing Hoffman and Gang
share in common is that both have nick-
names.

Hoffman has been affectionately
known as “Mud Puppy” or “Puppy” since
the team’s spring—break trip to Texas.
Hoffman was riding a horse across what

Despite what _
the Princeton I _j I
Invitational  
tournament 
announcer
thought, Beth
Gang’s name _ 
isn't ”Beta." 

 
 
 
 
  
   

 

  

appeared to be a dried-up stream when her
horse sunk in the mud and almost rolled
over on her.

“From my rnidthigh down to my
shoes, I was soaking wet with mud,” she
said.

At the Princeton Invitational in
September, Gang was set to take the court
when her name was armounced as “Beta
Gang.”

“I’ve been known as Beta ever since.”

The two should be even better friends
next year, when they’ll be roommates.

“Hopefully, we won’t get on each V

other’s nerves too much,” said a smiling
Gang.

 

Diver 

“Diving is timing, and gymnastics is
sheer power. I knew the basics to diving.
It was just a matter of cleaning it up a lit-
tle,” said Tomazich.

The following year, as a high school
freshman, Tomazich was the top diver on
her North Allegheny High School team
and was recruited by Julian Krug to take
part in his Sunday program. That is a pro-
gram that invites the area’s top high
school divers to come and practice for a
couple of hours on Sunday with better
equipment and coaching than their high
schools can offer.

Krug and Tomazich would forge a
unique athlete-coach relationship in which
both respect and think of each other as
equals.

“Julian is kind of like a father to me.
We have a mutual respect for each other.
He’s a laid-back person, which I am. He
listens to what I have to say,” said
Tomazich.

“We work together openly and up
front. She is very easy to talk with and is
receptive to everything I suggest,” said
Krug.

After ﬁnishing her high school career
with three consecutive state diving titles,
Tbmazich had her pick of where she want-
ed to attend college.-In the beginning of
her search, Pitt wasn’t even on the list.

“Pitt was the last place I wanted to go
to. I’d already been training here with
Julian for a number of years. I thought that
going to a city school would be the worst
possible thing for me,” said Tomazich.

Krug and women’s Head Coach
Marian Cassidy—Keen weren’t about to let
atfathlete of Tomazich’s ability sign with
another school after she had been training

 

  

 

at Pitt all through high school.

Tomazich recalls both coaches com-
ing to her during practice with a pen and
asking, “So, are you ready to sign now?”

When making her ﬁnal decision,
Tomazich realized that Pitt had everything
she wanted in a program and a school.

“Because I had been here so long, I
didn’t realize how perfect Pitt was for me.
I loved the coach, and Pitt has an excellent
travel-abroad program, which interests
me,” said Tomazich.

“We have a very strong and positive
relationship, and she had done quite well
with me in high school. It was clearly a
factor in her coming here,” said Krug.

In her freshman campaign, Tomazich
exceeded all expectations. She won both
diving events in nearly every dual meet,
placed in the top three in both events in the
Big East championships, and advanced to
the ﬁnals in the one-meter dive at the
NCAA ﬁnals.

“She was the ﬁrst female to final in
the NCAAs on the springboard in the his-
tory of Pitt,” said Krug.

For Tomazich, it is not a matter of
how far she can go in diving. It’s a matter
of whether she wants to, she will. The
Olympics and an NCAA championship
are not dreams for her but instead realistic
goals. But, the most amazing thing about
her is that she really doesn’t care what she
wins or achieves. If she is having fun, she
is happy, and that’s all that matters.

“If it happens, it happens. It’s not life
and death for me. I don’t place a lot of
emphasis on placement [,but instead,]
more on if I felt I did a good job or not.
I’m conﬁdent in my ability, and I just have
fun out there,” said Tomazich.
