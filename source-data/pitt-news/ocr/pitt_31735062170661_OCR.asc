Housing ProceduresPermif Criminal Acts

by DEBBIE POPP

Benjamin Franklin asserted that
industry and frugality were the
means to acquire wealth. Today,
as in Franklin’s time, that way
to riches soon becomes tedious
and often unproductive. Easier
courses to affluence must be, and
are, available. One such way is to
steal.

I Stealing can be an easy as well .

as profitable way to earn a living
or supplement an income. To show
just how easy stealing can be I

v will share the following exper-

ience with you.
Early Thursday afternoon I rob-

:'\I)ed a room within University

A‘

Housing. It was the first and only
robbery that I have committed.
By the picture accompanying this
story, one can see the burglary
proved profitable. The estimated
value of the catch was $161.

I am not bragging on how well I
did, for I realize it just may have
been beginners luck or the circum-
stances. The circumstances prob-
ably had the greater impact on the
robbery than luck or my skill as a
thief. For I had a key to the room.

Having a key removed the great-
est obstacle standing between me
and the goodies—the door. I did
not have to pound, smash, or
break anything. I just had to open‘

."'-the door, walk in, fill my tote bag

tag

with what I saw as valuable, pick .

up the bag, walk out, and lock the
door. ~

Because the key was the essen-
tial factor that facilitated the rob-
bery, I think it important to tell
how and where I obtained it. I
simply got the key from the key
room in the maintainence depart-
ment.

Earlier in the morning of the
robbery, I went to the key room in
the basement of Tower A, report-
ed that I had lost my’ key and re-
quested another one.

The man attending the keyroom
congenially asked my room num-
ber and what hall. I told him 225
North Holland, which truthfully is
not my room. The man checked
through the files on the opposite
wall and asked my last name. I
retorted, “McClung” and inquired
if I would have to wait until the
key was made. He replied that if

an extra one was available, a wait >

would not be necessary.

in my wallet along with my stu-
dent identification and non-aca-
demic invoice. I did not want to
pull the wallet our in front of the
attendant in case that would act
as a reminder to see any indenti-
fication.

So, I stepped just outside the
door, got the $5 from my wallet
and handed him the money when
I came back into the room.

Taking the bill, the man re-
/,

LOOT “stolen” from student's dorm room by Pitt News master thief.

The man next went to a smaller
filing cabinet along the left wall
and pulled a card out. Then, as he

walked back toward the desk, he-

asked if I lived alone. I said,
“Yes,” knowing that room 225
wasa single.

Placing the card on the desk, he
said the charge for a replaced key
would be $5. I told him I did not
have the $5 with me but my friend

waiting outsidemight. ’

Actually, no friend was outside
and I did have the money with me

Extends Term of Office ”

S.G. Acts on Agenda

by KAREN BURGIO

At Thursdays meeting, Student Government passed the Student
Government By-Laws, an action which allows the out-going SG to’,re-
tain its office for a short period after the election, and eliminates the
former constitutional necessity of swearing in the newly elected gov-
ernment on the night of the election. I

The Pitt Bowling C1ub’s request for recognition as ai-student or-
ganization was denied on the grounds that the club had only five mem-
bers, not the necessary 10. '

For the same reason the Revolutionary Socialist Union was de-
clared ineligible for funds‘. a

 SDS was alloted $200 in funding for the purchase of a typewriter

and for costs of running ads in the Pitt News. They had originally re-
quested $1,800. Funding was passed for the Men’s Glee Club tour, Stu-
dio Theatre, Chess Club, Student Government, the Army ROTC Ball,
and Engineering Week.

President Tom Bailey reported that next year there will be a man-
datory meal ticket for dorm students, with a choice of buying a meal
plan with 19, 14, 10, or five meals per week.

Bailey explained that the snack shop in Tower B lobby had been
closed because Szabo had found it financially infeasible to operate these
facilities. The Wooden Keg Sub Shop,’ in the Tower C lobby, had been
closed due to health violations. The shop had been cooking food with no
sink or ventalation. ‘ ‘

The Book Store Committee reported that the Physics Department
as well as other University departments had been complaining of the
quantity of “entertaining” reading material in the Book Center. The
Physics Department feels there should be more intellectual books in

the Book Center and suggested that representatives from departments _ I
~. could recommend book titles for purchase by the store. .- —;

quested that I step in front of the
desk and sign for the key.

My heart and my eyes stopped
in mid blink, while a hot flash
surged from my stomach. I had
not anticipated, forging a,signa-
ture. I had not practiced writing
the»student’s name. Her signa-
ture was on the original key form
and I glanced at it and tried to
rnake a mental impression of it. "

I I took the pen and made a sig-
nature. The first letter of her

-namewas‘ the only letter that I

intentionally wrote and had any
control over in writing. The rest
of the signature was written in a
nervous spasm.

My teeth ground together as I
handed the form over. I thought
my career as a. thief would now
end before I even became a no-
vice. Under my strained gaze, the
one form with the authentic sig-
nature and the. one with forged
signature were only shuffled and
the key was handed to me. The

V most difficult phase of the rob-
bery was over.

With the key in my possession,
I had only to wait until I knew the
room would be empty.

When that time came, as I said,
I simply entered the room and
packed my bag with a clock radio,
an electric hair curler set, a light-
ed make-up mirror, :1 filled jew-
elry box, a camera, a jar of pea-
nut butter, one cat bank, and a
one dollar bill.

The robbery was completed suc-
cessfully and easily.

I use this incident as an exam-
ple of exactly how easily one can
steal to supplement one’s income.

I also use this incident’ as an
example of how University secur-

ity is often lacking. A large per-
centage of the robberies in the
residence halls are accomplished
because students fail to lock their
doors. The students, then, must
assume responsibility. In this in-
stance,‘ however, a negligent stu-.

, dent. was not at fault.

Identification or possession of a
non-academic invoice should have
been required before a key was
given out. The questions asked.
were not enough to substantiate
proof that the student requesting /
the key was the one actuallyvliv-
ing in the room. Even the most in-
competent thief could have the
information needed to answer
such general questions.

If a student can so easily ac-

quire a key to any room in Univer— 

sity Housing, other slips in the se-

curity procedures must be hap- -

pening. I
These small slip-ups cost and

deprive the student of records, '

stereos, televisions, and other
valuables, as well as spending’
money for which many students

have worked. Cautious and stren-. »

uous enforcement of security pro-
cedures is necessary to prevent
the industrious thief from acquir-
ing ano_ther’s wealth.

Housing Anticipates

Increase in Dorm Fee

by LARRY PANSINO

An increase in the residence fee
is anticipated by the Housing Of-
fice for all Pitt dormitories be-
ginning in the next fall term. Don-
ovan Hughes, Associate Director
of Housing, attributed the raise in
part to the newly recommended
optional series of board rate plans.

Hughes explained the new rate
structure: The University re-
ceives 26 per cent of all board
fees, which presently are a stan-
dard $300 per term for each stu-
dent. Under the food plan that his
office recommended for next fall,
residents would have a choice of
a series of board rates scaled to
how often a student chooses to eat
in the dorms‘-. '

For the residents who will opt

for less than the full board rate,
the University’s 26 per cent cut of

their fee will be less than the cur- . ~ 3' ‘

rent percentage yield of $78 per
invoice. The difference must be
made up to fund the maintenance
of the dormitories, hence the ex-
pected hike in the room rent fee’.

Also contributing to the hike is‘ 

a mandatory plan to install a tele-
phone in each living accommoda-
tion.

Hughes said a student willibe  -

able to pay less than the present
$625 per term next year if the stu-
dent exercises one of the board
rate options.

Hughes gave‘ no word on how
great the increase will be, but
speculates that such an announce-
ment will be forthcoming soon.

holes in an ordinance which forces
the University to turn over 10 per
cent of all procedes from enter-

heard that the University of Colo-

Pitt Music Faculty Goes Baroque

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Baroque—a style of composition
abounding in the extreme or ir-
regular, both in harmony and
rhythmic organization.

While Voltaire demanded a def-
inition of terms before any credi-

ble discussion could occur, one
doubts that even he could have

, come up with an all encompassing

definition of Baroque music. In-
deed, one doubts thatanyone could
ever have come up with a really
good definition of the period.

This dilemma has become all too
apparent in light of such diction-
ary attempts, as the one given at

in Harrisburg

the introduction to this article,
and it is even more apparent after
this past Saturday’s Department
of Music concert devoted to “Mu-
sic of the Baroque.

Rather than take the above at-
tempt as an imprecise definition
of the baroque, it readily becomes
too precise a definition,for the
opening opus on Saturday’s pro-
gram, the Goldberg Variations of
J. S. Bach. Here, in an aria and
30 variations, Dr. Don Franklin,
with the aid of his Dowd harpsi-
chord, demonstrated the spatial
gradeur of Bach.s genius. The as-
cending line of_the composition’s
nine canons, a virtual graclus ad
Parnassum, is indeed designed to

[carry both artist and listener to

the heights.

Quite unfortunately, however,
these heights were never quite
reached in Saturday evening’s
climb and we have none other that

the oft recurrent flu bug to blame
in this regard. Franklin, hardly
up to the potential required in
bringing vitality to the many fac-
ets of this work, suffered visibly
from the effects of the flu through-
out.

Despite bad runs,
playing, and a somewhat mechani-
cal approach throughout the vari-
ations, rubato was very often pre-
sent and two of the more laudable
portions of the work deserve to
be cited. Both the French Over-
ture and the concluding Quodlibet
rang with a precision that was
very often lacking in the remain-
der of the composition.

~ Following interval, a sextet of
works by Purcell, Simpson, Tele-
mann, and Handel concluded the
program and demonstrated the
variety inherent in baroque style.
Especially noteworthy was the
Telemann Trio in F Major, offer-
ed by Don Franklin, harpsichord;
Frank Trificante, viola da gamba,
and Colin Sterne, recorder. A
sense ‘of trialogue rang true
throughout the work. A few in-
correct fingerings plagued Trif-
icante in an otherwise fairly suc-
cessful attempt.

imprecise"

Soprano Mary Ann Doody, in
exquisite voice,_opened the sec-
ond portion of the program with
songs of Purcell and ended it
most floridly with a secular can-
tata of G. F. Handel, Pensieri not-
turni di filli. Recounting the
dreaming thoughts of a young girl,
Ms. Doody conveyed in aria and
recitative amorous dauntings in
that rich Italian style to which
Handel remained faithful through-
out his career as a composer.

All in all, the evening proved
most rewarding. Despite many
of the problems cited above, the
spirit of good musicianship was
still present. The intimacy of the
Frick auditorium, so proper for
baroque ensemble, as well as the
presence of a most attentive au-
dience made the evening’s music
making _a most worthwhile exper-
ience. .

Concert Semi-Successful Despite Duke's Flu

by STEVE LUBETSKY
Despite his apparent divine-like

‘ qualities, even Duke Ellington. ac-

claimed pianist and band leader,
can get the flu. The trouble is that
he had it Saturday night, which
was to be his first public appear-
ance in Pittsburgh in many an era.

Son Mercer Ellington, trumpet
player with the band, announced
the unpleasant news to an unhap-
by throng ranging from ages 20
to 60, who anxiously packed Heinz
Hall to see the legendary figure.

However, Ellington recognized
the importance of the event (to
raise money for the Pittsburgh
Guild for the Blind) and refused to

» let his illness interfere with his

orchestra’s scheduled perform-
ance. In his place, he appointed
close associate Ozzie Matthews,
who accepted the keyboard chores
for the night.

As a pianist, Matthews is hard-

ly incompetent, but it was obvious
something was lacking. Accord-
ingly, he merely lived upto his
assignment of filling in for the
Duke, no more, no less. Apparent-
ly, as a colleague of Ellington, he
had been trained for such emer-
gencies, and technically he was
quite successful in his handling of
typical Ellington phrases.

But emotionally, Matthews was
most superficial, which contrast-
ed with the natural outflow of
sound the rest of the band pro-
vided.

Bearing this handicap, the 17
band members had to assume an
additional burden, and they re-
sponded to the challenge nobly.
What they accomplished without
their great leader, however,
should come as no surprise, con-
sidering the immeasurable talent
of the personnel. The Ellington
band is comprised of some of the
finest musicians ever to play

 

their instruments. Few can com-
pare to baritone saxist Harry Car-
ney, tenormen Paul Gonsalves and
Norris Turney, trumpeter Cootie
Williams, trombonist Chuck Con-
nors, and drummer Rufus Jones,
each of whom was featured in
brilliantly played solos. Particu-
larly arresting was Carney’s ex-
ecution of “Sophisticated Lady,”
which was highlighted by an ex-
tended note, held during the clos-
ing bars.

Although the band played excel-
lently. the major contributions to-
wardssaving the evening came
from Anita Boyd, a jazz singer
from Houston, Texas, whose vi-
brancy and prancing about the
stage generated an atmosphere of
excitement among an apprecia-
tive audience.

the first part of the show, in the
second half it sizzled, sparked by

A Two Million
Dollar Headache

The problem of the inaccessibility of University buildings to

if handicapped persons is “an old headache,” according to Dr. J.

Newman of the Department of Special Education and Rehabili-

J " tation, and a headache that would take two million dollars to
 ‘remedy.

Newman and his department carried out a survey in 1970-71

 to determine whether the 38 University buildings were suitable

for the needs of students in wheelchairs.
The survey was based on Act 235 of the Commonwealth of

if ‘Pennsylvania, which sets certain criteria of accessibility for the

handicapped for all buildings built with Commonwealth funds.

The study revealed that not one University building meets
all of the requirements.

The provisions of Act 235, however, apply only to buildings
that were in the planning stages after 1965. '

While no legal action can be taken against the University,
Newman feels that Pitt has an ethical duty to provide facilities

‘students. _
'It is obvious that no one has actively discriminated against

L ;’- students in wheelchairs. However, through neglect, ignorance,

or by placing needed improvements too low on the list of prior-
ities, discrimination has resulted. '

Students confined to wheelchairs cannot take classes sched-

-uled on the second floor of the Cathedral of Learning.

In going from the Cathedral to Hillman Library in a wheel-

chair, one must transverse a two block obstacle course, leap-

 ing curbs and outrunning Oakland motorists.

[According to Newman, the University considered a curb

  cut too dangerous at the corner of Forbes and Bigelow, suggest-
,-‘ “ = ing one instead at the Towers. '



Newman feels that a four way stop light, such as those

 downtown, would eliminate many problems if installed at

Jay Rolings of the Department of Physical Plant told the

 Pitt News that the buildings going up on the Forbes Field sight

7 open both ways, adequate rest room facilities on each floor and-
 , be totally accessible to handicapped students through curb cuts

and a pedestrian bridge across Forbes Ave.
While this is commendable, something must be done to

As a state—related University, Pitt should not have to bear

Letters to the Editor

TV Trouble

Editor, The Pitt News:

I read, with great interest, the
letter in the Jan. 10 Pitt News
concerning the difficulties with
the Tower’s TV room attendant. A‘
similar incident occurred in Octo-
ber. A group of about 10 students
had gathered to watch television
at 6:30 p.m. When a George Mc-
Govern special came on, a wom-
an asked if anyone objected to
switching to the national news.
When one man opposed, a vote
was taken, the news won and the
woman went to switch channels.
All of a sudden, the one man who
had earlier expressed opposition
said, “Don’t touch that.” Upon be-
ing asked why, he said, “Don’t
touch that. We’ll watch what I
want to watch.” Since no particu-
lar reason was given, the woman
switched the channel. The man got
‘to his feet, switched back the spe-
cial, and said, “Touch that again
and you’ll be sorry!” The woman
ran out of the room and brought
back two campus police. The man
finally identified himself as the
attendant for the TV room, and
the police said that there was
nothing they could do. Several at-
tempts were made to contact the
Housing Office, ‘but the atten-
dant’s boss was never available.
Finally, the issue faded.

Now it seems that this was not

an isolated" incident. The question

arises as to who controls the
Tower’s TV. Are Tower’s resi-
dents paying someone to watch
the television programs that he

wants to watch, regardless of the
desires of the students in the
room? I hope that the Housing
Committee takes notice of these
incidents, especially since this
particular attendant.may be ap-
plying for a vacancy on the Tow-
ers Desk.

Endorsement

Editor, The Pitt News:

On behalf of the Black Action
Society I would like to fully en-
dorse William Lowman, William
Kilson, and Larry Manoff for Stu-
dent Government Board positions.
We fully endorse Terry Sadler for
Board president. These men have
shown us and their fellow students
of their sincerity and capability of
handling any problems or deci-
sions put to them. We are certain
that their varied opinions and ex-
periences will help to give the
Student Government Board a
more rounded representation of
students and ideas. These men
are work orientated and are both
humane and fair in their work and
are known student activists. They
have been and I’m sure will con-
tinue to be a great asset to our or-
ganization as well as other stu-
dent organizations. This exper-

ience also makes us feel that they‘

will be the best people for these
positions.

Unjustified Holiday

Editor, The Pitt News:_

It has come to my attention that
Monday, Jan. 15, is to be a Uni-
versity holiday commemorating
the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther
King. As a member of the Univer-
sity community I am shocked by
this action. With, all due respect
to Dr. King, whom I consider both
a great humanitarian and Ameri-
can, I feel that the University has
acted unjustly in designating Mon-
day a holiday. The University does
not recognize the birthdays of
Presidents Washington, Lincoln,
and Kennedy, why then Dr. King?
In my estimation this action rep-
resents a blatant example of “re-
verse discrimination.” It smacks
of an academic community being
intimidated by militancy. As an

action by an institution of higher.

education, it is not only unjustified,
but embarrassing.

Blue Suede Feet ~

by DENNIS PALUMBO

I have a friend who plays drums
fora local rock band and we were
talking the other day about the dif-
ficulty in coming up with a good
name for the group.

“The problem,” my friend said,
"is that the name has got to be dif-
ferent, catchy,- relevent, and sim-
ple; or else, it has to be compli-
cated, irrelevant, and hard to re-
member. You see that, don’t
you?” ,

“Of course, I see,” I replied. I
didn’t see.

My friend managed to see —
right through me. “You don’t un-
derstand at all.” Looking exasper-
ated fora moment, he continued:
“Try to look at it this way—you
either call a band Malo or you call
it Commander Cody and Lost
Planet Airmen. See?”

I saw.

“Either one works, it just de-
pends on the approach. Ijust wish
I knew which approach to take.” ’

“Well, what have you got so
far?"

He produced a list of names and

“Is there some real- message
hidden in it I don’t know about?”

“Maybe,” he replied with a
cryptic smile. “Maybe not.”

I wasn’t in the mood for a cryp-
tic drummer.

“But don’t you see?” he asked,
and I was afraid for a moment we
were going to start all that stuff
again.

I came clean immediately.
“No, Idon’t see. Explain.”

“Well, you know all about blue
suede shoes, right? So instead of
blue suede shoes, we use blue
suede feet. It’s different, unique,
completely irrelevant—and yet
there’s that little reminder of
something you’re very familiar
with. Enough so that the name
sticks in your mind. Fascinating,
isn’tit? -

I began to appreciate.-more fully

the ingenuity of the big record
company‘ PR men.

“Blue Suede Feet, eh?” I play-
ed with the name. “Sort of re-
_ minds you of the fifties.”

“Yeah, I thought about that. But
it’s no problem—we’ll do a fifties
set in the middle of a gig. Every-
body does. «

/_;.

“That makes sense, I guess,” I ’

said. I looked down at the list.
.“So it’s Blue Suede Feet, for cer-
A tain?” ~

“Yep,” the drummer said, “un-

less we come up with a more (or _

less) relevant (or irrelevant),
different (or familiar), catchy _(or
complicated) name for the band.”

“Like what?” I asked.

N “Like one with my name in front
. . you know, Amazing Harold
and His Incredible, Imaginary—'.”

—I fled.

Dave Bluey

My goal in the past year as a
member of the Student Govern-
ment Board was to make Student
Government an effective and co-
hesive body that worked on stu-
dent concerns and found solutions
to student problems. The student
voice was heard at all University
Executive Committees ‘and stu-
dents were activitely represented
on University-wide issues such as
faculty tenure and community re-
lations. Pressure was exerted
upon the administration to give
priority to student needs and com-
mitmentst and improvements
were made in these areas. Some
of these in which I took an active
part in included remodeling the
present Student Union with addi-
tions being added to it in the near
future, obtaining the old Bimbo’s
complex as a student lounge, ren-
ovation of the Towers dormi-
tories, a non-mandatory meal plan
for resident students, optional
health insurance designed for/stu-
dents specific needs, and increas-
ed campus security.

I would like to continue my ef-
forts to bring about changes with-
in the University that are condu-
cive to student interests and de-
sires. The Book Store should be
forced to sell required textbooks
on a non-profit basis, because of
the monopoly they have in this
area. A Pittsburgh Student Coop-

erative should be established be- ‘

tween the Student Governments
in the Pittsburgh area to provide
better programming and concerts
at a smaller cost to the individual
student bodies. Campus communi-
cations could be greatly increased
if TV monitors were placed at va-
rious locations on campus to pro-
vide a source of information as to
what activities are taking place.
Academic advising should be re-
structured to provide more com-

3:2; prehensive assistance for those

students who want and need such
a service but it should not be an-
other administrative requirement
for those of us who can get along
through self-determination. The
University ~ Placement Service
should be given a much higher

priority in administrative func-
tions so as to provide increased
and better employment of Pitt
students and graduates.

With the valuable experience I
have gained and with the determ-
ination I have in getting these and
other goals accomplished, I feel
that I can make further strides
in providing Pitt students with the
type of Student Government that
works for their sole benefit.

Tim Ging

As in any campaign, this year’s
Student Government election is
marred by similar promises from
a number of candidates. Where
the promises are the same, the
voters’ only reliable indicator is
past experience and proven lead-
ership.

For the past year and a half, I
have served as chairman of the
Pitt Tenant Union (PTU).'As one
of ‘the founders and first chair-
man, I have been-involved in num-
erous projects._ ,

It was the PTU that initiated
the petition drive and lead the
fight for the acceptance of the
modified meal ticket. Efforts are
currently underway to provide
dorm students with insurance for
their possessions. In view of re-
cent flooding in Tower B, resi-
dents of the dorms, in particular.
know the possible value of this
type of insurance.

The PTU has handled 0ver_300
cases involving student tenants on
or off-campus. We are presently
trying to alleviate Oakland’s park-
ing problem. Parking tickets,
parking meters, and the concen-
tration of meter maids in Oakland
are all under investigation. This
effort is being handled in conjunc-

tion with the Legal Awareness!

Committee.

The University Housing con-
tract is also being investigated by
the PTU.

These. projects have affected
both on-campus students and com-
muters.

In an election where campaign
promises are almost identical,
experience does count. My record

over the last year and a half is evi-
dence I can and will work. On
Jan. 16 and 17, I urge you to vote
and to vote on ability, not prom-
ises.

Regis Kaufman

We, as members of this Uni-
versity, must realize the impor-
tance of communication. It is the
one thing that can bridge the gap
between different people, organ-
izations, and communities. It can
help turn condescending ideas and
wants into workable solutions and
goals. As Student Government
president, I would place commun-
ication between the students and

, your Student Government Board

as my top priority. I would advo-
cate regular, open, publicized
meetings that would give the stu-
dents an opportunity to air any
gripes or ask any questions con-
cerning the operations of their
Student Government. These meet-
ings and
chairman. I would also like to in-
stitute a mailing list made up of
major student groups so that they
could be kept abreast of Student
Government policy.

Other things that I’d like to see
Student Government do include:
(1) investigation of allocation po-
licies, including programing, bud-
geting, and student benefits from
certain services; (2) examina-
tion of _the possibility of conglo-
merate concerts at the Civic
Arena involving Pitt, CMU, Du-
quesne, Carlow, and Chatham;
(3) providing more social outlets
for the student, such as opening
the old Bimbo’s complex as a Uni-
versity night club; (4) finalizing
plans for a non-mandatory meal
plan; (5) investigating the Book
Store and University Pharmacy
monopolies; (6) broadening the
services of the Placement Center,
and (7) providing greater secur-
ity for the students.

If you think that communication
is the basic problem in having an
effective Student Government,
and that a good working basis
must be established’ to accomp-
lish anything at all. _By all means
vote for Rege Kaufman for SG

standing committee ‘

president on Jan. 16 and 17.

I think that my past experience
with SG people, students, admin-
istrators, student activity person-
al, and mentors has given me this
positive working basis which is so
vital for communication and ulti-
mately tangible solutions to your
needs. ‘

Remember, your vote is the only
voice that you have, don’t waste
it.

Ken Stein-berg

It‘ seems that year after year
there’s less and less at stake be-
cause Student. Qlovernment has
become more and more ineffec-
tive. The examples of this that
stand out most clearly in my mind
are the Book Store, the parking
problem, adequate and fairrepre—
sentation, and Student Govern-
ment’s position on campus and in
the community.

Pitts Book Store is an incredi-
ble example of mismanagement
and lack of student control. No-
body denies this, yet nobody’s sug-
gested just what to do about it. I
propose that the students control
the -Book Store through Student
Government, as they do at other
universities. Students could then
receive credits and paid employ-
ment, and actually be involved in
decision-making, while the prof-
its now absorbed by the Universi-

vty can be turned back to the stu-

dents in the form of discounts.

Finding a parking space at Pitt
is like trying to dodge potholes-
no amount of luck will help! At
other urban universities. each
new building must provide park-
ing for those who use it. Ipropose
that Student Government act as a
lobby to assure that the buildings
now under construction or consi-
deration provide adequate park-
ing. Also, I think that Student
Government should petition City
Council to lower meter rates.
Shoppers don’t use those meters
—students do.

Student Government, as we
know it, has not been an effective
organization for advocating stu-
dents’ needs, grievances, and/or
rights. Why, with’ a huge enter-

tainment budget, the present Stu-
dent Government can’t even bring
in decent rock groups! I propose
that a council be formed between
all student governments in Alle-
gheny County. This council would
provide the strength to lobby our
legislators to stop the rising
costs of tui,ion, and could move to

alleviate cross-registration prob-

lems for students who wish to
take courses at other schools in
this area. It would also be large
and strong enough to bring in big-
name groups more often. After
all, Pittsburgh is only slightly
more concert-starved‘ than An.-
chorage, Alaska! I ask for your
consideration of these points,.and
your vote. Thank you.

C Ira Dichter

(Editor's Note: This statement by
Board candidate Ira Dichter was
omitted from Friday's issue.)

With $300,000 in funds and ad- ‘

ministrative facilities, the Student

Board is unquestionably an un- '

tapped source of student power.
Just how to use this power is a
crucial question.

To focus it on the problems
(high book costs, tuition raisest
which stem from national eco-
nomic causes would be futile.‘ For
these answers the Board must in-

form students of organizations

with far greater resources. But,

to wield this power on a local lev-’ ’ if B

el against the problems of over- if

priced activities, parking, off-
campushousing, and personal se-
curity would be devastating. Past
Boards have spread themselves
too far and produced little. To
solve just one of these problems

. would make the Board successful.

Too many student leaders blame
their non—productivity on student
apathy. I say bull shit. These peo-

.._...._...’

ple are interested in personal rec- .. I

ognition, not problem solving. Ev- V
ery student has the right to cast [

his ballot and expect a competent
Board without having to be its
watchdog. I don’t desire recogni-
tion, just a chance to work.

   Fazio Quits . Post

by VINCE _Di NARDO
Scrafino Fazio, one of the last remaining links of the departed Carl

DePasqua regime, resigned
post at the University. '

'  Fazio announced he was taking an assistant coaching position at , :

late last week from his head recruiting

the University of Cincinnati, so as to get back on the gridiron. .
“I wanted to coach again, that’s why I’m going to Cincinnati,"

I "Foge” Fazio said. “No one here put any, pressure on me to leave.”

Fazio had been contacted by Youngstown University earlier and
rumor had it that Fazio would leave then.

Now the feeling is ramped that former Pitt head coach Dave Hart

will assume Fazio’s responsibilities.‘

New head coach Johnny Majors is a believer in having hand pick-

ed assistants doing the work for/. him.

“I didn’t talk to Majors about coaching here,” Fazio said. “It ap-
peared he would be bringing most of his Iowa State staff.” '

The 33-year-old Fazio was a graduate of Pitt in 1960. He was the
starting center for the Panthers and because of his durability was call-

ed “Ironman” by his teammates. He graduated from Coraopolis High .

School in 1956 before coming to Pitt. He was a member of the Boston
Patriots for one year before beginning his coaching career at Ambridge

High School.

Fazio returned to his high school alma mater for a two-year coach-
ing stint before moving to Boston University for two more.

He was named to DePasqua’s staff in 1969 and became head re-

cruiter in the spring of 1972.

Further confusion as to the future of the _head recruiting post was
added by a Pitt official, who said there was no assurance the post would

be continued.

. "Last year, not being on the field, not being with the pla_vers—
miss it. I’ think I owe it to myself to do something I can be happy in,“

' Fazio concluded.

NEWLY named Pitt football coach John- _

ny Majors will hold another news confer-
ence—this one for the down trodden stu-
dent football fans of the University.

Majors, who has been out of town,
continually recruiting, since his appoint-
ment, will start with what he considers
the root of the fan problem—-the student
body. The former Iowa State coach will
speak at the Student Union Ballrooom
Thursday night, Jan. 26, at 7\:30.

Majors will mingle with the student
fans in attendance before addressing the
group formerly and answering questions,
it was announced by Pitt Sports Informa-
tion Director Dean Billick Friday.

Majors a firm believer in student sup-
port and this bit of ‘‘internal public rela-
tions" is designed to jntroduce the coach
that so many good things have been said
about. '

Bomb Dukes

Schaeffer’s drive from the point
deflected off a Duke skater into
the net to tie the score at four all.
With five minutes left in the per-
iod, Glen Hyde cranked up with a
booming drive from the red line
that Wolkowitz attempted to kick
out. The blistering drive glanced
off his goal stick into the net. Just
before the buzzer Rick Baginski
set up Dave Bahnson for his first
of three goals.

Browne and Bahnson both pick-

led up their second goals of the

night within a 25 minute span
early in the third period. The
Dukes roared back with a pair of
goals but Mark Lieberman settled
down to make two good saves on
breakaways. “

Browne and Bahnson picked up
their hat tricks late in the game
to rub in the defeat. Pitt wound
up with a 40-23 advantage in shots
on goal by the end of the game.

Cracked Ice: The Dukes insert-
ed Bob Mitro in goal after Wolk-
owitz wasn’t going to repeat his
performance of last year. Du-
quesne’s C. H. Bender wound up
leaving for the hospital in the
third period. Bahnson’s hat trick
was his second in two games.
Mark Lesnick, Sue Ruffner, and
Tom Bailey, all candidates for
Student Government, came out to
cheer the icers on.

John Finney intentionally refus-
ed to fight a Duke skater as the
latter pulled him down on the ice
and it was a wise decision. The
Duke skater drew a triple minor
and gave the icers the main ad-
vantage and Pitt scored two goals
then.

_ letes and they never gave up,” he

continued.

Looking ahead to Tuesday’s
meet with Kent State, Banner
doesn’t know who will be com-
peting.

“I’ll know‘ tomorrow at prac-
tice,” he said. ' "

Kent State is a very strong
team, according to Banner.

“They are difficult if we are in
good shape and'even more diffi-
cult if the team is in poor health,”
said Banner. -

Gerald Tinker of Kent is an
Olympic gold medalist in the 400
meter. Tinker, a transfer from
Memphis State to Kent, was in-
eligible last year. Also very out-
standing for Kent is Jerry Toutin
in the 660. ' I’

“They havelgood field men,”
said Banner. ’

It will be a guessing game of
who will compete for Pitt due to
the flu and Tuesday’s meet should
be very interesting. The field
events start at 7 p.m. and the run-
ning events begin at 8 p.m. “The
team would like to see a good
turnout from the student body as

in previous years,” said Banner.

Flu Bug Demolishes

Gymnasts, Lose two

by RON SIEGEL

The flu set in on Pitt’s gymnastic team over the weekend, and the
results were staggering. The team was already undermanned, and fur-
ther losses due to illness caused the team to be demolished in two meets
in New England over the weekend by 158-89 to Southern Connecticut and
144-71 to Springfield. 9 _ T

The team arrived in Southern Connecticut on Friday, and Dan
Campbell, Cliff Custer, John Hornick, and Elliot Sanft all came down
with the flu. Campbell and Custer had temperatures of 102 degrees.

Campbell did not participate on Friday and everybody else on the
team cut their routines short, as they were affected by the flu bug to
some extent.

After the game, it was uncertain whether the team would go on to
play Springfield on Saturday. They finally decided to do so, but the
forementioned players were confined to their rooms upon arrival.

Campbell, Custer, and Hornick did not dress for the meet, and\Pitt
ended up entering nobody in the high bar and rings events. In other
events, Pitt only entered two men.

In order to give the customers a full evening of entertainment,
Springfield gymnasts put on special exhibitions to _fill the time.

The Pitt gymnasts will have until Friday to recover from the flu,
which by then will either have the whole team in bed or completely
healthy. i

If healthy, they will travel to Kent State for a Friday evening match
against the Golden Flashes. In view of the relatively small size of the
Pitt squad, the gymnasts are rated underdogs in all of-their matches.
Next home match is Jan. 24 against West Virginia.

Tankers Bow to Bisons

by YAIER LEHRER

The Pitt swimmers suffered a
crushing defeat at the hands of
Bucknell by a score of 77-36 at
the Trees Hall pool last Saturday.

Bucknell, paced by swimmers
Joe Trisczuk, who won the 1000-

_ yard freestyle and placed second

in the 500-yard freestyle, and All-
American Steve Winings who won
both sprint events, seemed to
completely outclass the mermen.

This meet had been billed as a
close one but the swimmers were
not in full strength.

Mark Winters was sick and was
only able to salvage two third
places in the distance events,
races in which he usually excells.
The absence of distance swimmer
Jerry 0’Leary due to sickness,
and sprinter George Hawes were
factors that made the tough job
of beating Bucknell even tougher.

The tankers started off well by
wining the 400-yard medley relay
with a combination of Mark Wal-
lace, John Templin, Dave Natali,
and Dave Simeone. 3

Things seemed to go downhill
for the swimmers after that. They

There were some bright spots

set a new Pitt team record in the
backstroke while John Templin

and Dave Natali won in the 200-

The Pitt swim record is now 1-1
and they will face Penn State at

at Trees Hall pool.

  Pitt Grapplers Split At Home

by BILL PROUDFOOT

Lately, Pitt’s wrestling team
has found itself in sour circum-

' . ‘stances. Winning or losing going

into the final matches, the meets
have outcome dependent on the
final pairings.

This weekend the Pitt matmen

had to settle for a split with their
foes-.

They were beaten Friday night,

19-13, by Delaware, and on Satur-
day the Cats snatched an 18-13
verdict from Maryland.

Both meets took place at the
Field House, and both were un-
decided until the finalwmatchups.

Inexperience and an admitted
"coaching error” cost the Pan-
thers a win over Delaware, ac-
cording to Coach Dave Adams.

"The coach blew one,” he said,
"I just put in too many inexper-

ienced men in a.t one time. We.

got behind too soon and this put
too much pressure on them. We
needed some stabilizing factors,
about two more experienced

Pitt fell behind after the first
two matches as rookies Dave De-
Marino and Don Rother were
beaten.in the 118 and 126 pound
classes. Bob Baily shut out Dela-
ware’s Mike Macy, 7-0, and fresh-
man Ron Selfridge earned a draw
with Jeff Buckworth.

John Buzzato whipped Craig
Carter, 8-4, and evened the team

. score, 8-8. At 158 pounds, Dan De-

vine proved to be no match for
De1aware’s‘ best, Nick Martin.
Martin whipped Levine, 11-3.

Ray Dallatore got the points
back, evening the team score by

squeaking past Randy Muhein,»

5-4. But Pitt could manage only a
draw in the 190 pound class by
George Calcagnini, and lost their
second in a row at home.

“I still feel we were capable of
beating them with the kids we put
on the mat,” said Adams, “but I
guess I expected too much. But
these kids are going to get a lot
better with experience.”

Saturday night Pitt had its turn
in beating out the last minute cav-
alry charge. The Cats walked out
mean and grabbed a quick lead-—
15-3 after the first five matches.
They then hung on to whip Mary-
land, 18-15. '

The Panthers got a break when
Rob Stover was warned three
times for various violations and
was finally disqualified in the 142
pound class, giving the Panthers
an important six points.

The Cats evened it up in the 126
