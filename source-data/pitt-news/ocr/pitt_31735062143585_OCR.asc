which the Queen will be chosen. In
former years, only six women have
been nominated, but this year, be-
cause of difficulty of narrowing the

“Minick,”

By SAM HONIGBERG
The Pitt Players concluded their
season at the Y. M, & W. H. A. Audi-
torium last night with a touching
presentation of George S. Kaufman's

and Edna Ferber’s “Minick."
All of us are familiar with this
titular character—-the old father who,-
left alone after the death of his wife,

to live with his son. In this play he
is -Minick; in the: Hill District. you
may know him as Old Man Cohen, and
on Beechwood boulevard they call
him Grandpa Lowenthal.

Some are fortunate to puff an ex-
pensive cigar and take a daily
pleasure walk in their son's or daugh-
ter's garden; others are sent to L0-
gan or Market street to bargain the
family's groceries, and care for Junior
who isn’t old enough to go to school.

In this play, Minick is as welcome
to his son’s house as an unexpected
quiz at 8:30 in the morning (or even
an expected one, for that matter).
The very first evening in his new
home ﬁndshim friendless and alone,
his son and-_ daughter-in-law having
left to join a party. Here is an effec-
tive bit of acting on the part of C.
Howard Smith who, as Minick, left
all by himself at nine o'clock in the

Pitt Players Production,

must hide his reluctance and come *

evening, has nothing to do but go to
bed,

Proves Hit

Outside of this trrue-to-life cliaracter,
“Minick" still remains a domestic
play in every detail. It is so close to
the truth of the home as it actually
exists in life that romance seekers
can ﬁnd little inspiration in it. And
this is probably the major reason why
“Minick” back in 1924 ran only 141
performances on Broadway.

Most theater-goers feel uncomforta-

ble when a play “strikes home.”
They resent having their entertain-
ment study too carefully the transcript
of life. Which probably accounts for
the fact that co-author George 
Kaufmann has lately turned his
talents to lighter subjects, such
as witnessed in his two current suc-
cesses, “Dinner At Eight” and “Of
Thee I Sing.”

As entertainment, the play suffers
from the familiarity of the subJect.l
The outcome of the plot IS too 0bVl-I
ous. You know, for example. that ill‘? 
sniffing of the daughter-in-law behind ,
M_inick's back will eventually drive;
the old man to the Home for Aged-

Under the. expert direction of Carl
B. Cass, the cast,"on the whole, turned
in ﬂawless performances. It is certain-
ly true of C. Howard Smith who made
Minick sympathetic and lovable. He
repeats the good work which he made

Beer Problem

Twelve Activities Leaders
Comment on Action
of Trustees

Sentiment Is For Beer

 

An
some of the most prominent activities
leaders showed that the stand taken
by the Board of Trustees on the beer
situation and its effect on the Univer-
sity is causing a good deal of com-
ment for and against the new regula-
tion. According to the ruling made
early this week, neither the sale nor
use ‘of legalized beverages is allowed
on the campus, while the student
publications are not allowed to ad-
vertise alcoholic drinks.

‘ Genevieve Blatt, president of VVo-
men’s Debating Association and Chief
Justice of the‘ Senior Court, when
questioned, declared, “Whether we

drink-tliis ‘non-intoxicating’..-beer is a ,_

purely personal matter, but our drink-
ing it on University property is a
matter with which the trustees can
be concerned. Whether this particu-
la.r action is justiiied or not——I can-
not say. After all, I wasn't very old
in the pre-prohibition days."

Rose Marie Demestich-as, president

statement and said: “Like Miss Blatt.
I can't rememb-er much about pre-
prohibition days, but I'm glad to see
that we won't have t.o dodge the
swinging doors in Alumni Hall. I be-
lieve that the statement by the trus-
tees is a natural and wise one, and
will serve to control any sudden ﬂare
on the campus that ‘the boys’ might
h-ave wanted."

Contrary to the above opinions
many of the men on the campus have
taken the opposite side. John P.
Bracken, president of Me-n’s Debating
Association, is in sympathy with that
side. He stated, "I regret that the
Univ.ersity.. ..f.ee1s.. ca1lecL._upon_ .to ..ta.k_.e
such a.n action on the beer question.
The University will have the same
experience with this ruling as -the
nation has had in attempting to en-.
force the Volstead Act. Students of
this day are to be advised not com-
manded; they will, I feel sure, resent
this ruling and go out of their way
to disregard it. It is rulings such as?
these that make for disrespect for all
university rulings and traditions.

Arthur Goldberg, editor—in-chief of
the Owl, advanced a similar opinion.
“I believe that the question of beer
should be left to the individual stu-
dent. The governing bodies of the
United States have decided that 3.2
beer is non-intoxicating and it should
be the policy of the University to
agree to this. Beer is not intoxicat-
ing until the courts decide it as such
and that seems to be unlikely. It is!
illogical to try to conceal the fact that I
the students will drink beer ii’ that is
the purpose. However, I can well
realize the position which the Uni-
versity is forced to take upon this
question as so many people are unde-
cided -as to the legality and morality
of the beer question.”

Robert Kramer, business manager
of the Panther, maintains the follow-
ing opinion: “Beer is a beverage. I
suppose the Trustees do not want

lications, because they have founcb
out that The News, The Panther, and
The Owl are already all wet.”

Comprehensive in every respect, the
examination will show each senior

what should be done to correct them.

In a motion “to prohibit the use,
service, and storage of beer and wine
in fraternity houses and at fraternity
functions,” Interfraternity Council
went on record Tuesday night oppos-
ing any departure by member frater-

tion law. At the time the motion was
passed, the representatives had not
yet learned of the ruling adopted by
the trustees of the University to pre-
vent campus sale and use of legal-
ized beverages.

Selection of Interfraternity Council
officers and of the Interfraternity
Handbook editor for next year com-
prised the major balance of business
taken up at the meeting at the Phi

Fraternity Group Makes
Strict Ruling On Beer  

»Delta, was named editor of the 1934
Interfraternity Handbook while Jules
Green, Col. '35, Pi Lambda Phi, and
Robert Bowdler, Col. '35, were ap-
pointed as his associates.

The motion committing the frater-
nity body to deﬁnite disapproval of
any policy other than absolute prohi-
bition among the fraternities received
no dissenting comment from the rep-
resentatives present.

Several members stated that their
own fraternities had already received
restrictive orders from national head-
quarters which would he in effect re-
gardless of any action taken by the
council. It was pointed out that In-
terfraternity Council would not take
any further action on the question,
but would leave the enforcement of
prohibitive regulations to the indi-
vidual fraternities and to the Univer-
sity.

Leroy Lewis, Col. '34, speaking on
"the motion said:

“I can't see that we have anything
to be greatly concerned about, Cer-
_tainly, we have no thought of slipping
‘from, our present “high standing. We

'Goldb—ei:g_Plan

Gives Women
Council Posts

Lewis, McCune and Curran
Win in Internal
Elections

Elections Set Apr. 28

The old bugaboos of freshman
men's customs and election reform
showed their ugly heads again at Stu-
dent Counci1's meeting Wednesday
night causing the school's legislators
to convene again this afternoon to
decide upon the drastic changes in
women's elections suggested by Ar-
thur Goldberg, Col. '33. ~

Goldberg's suggestion, which re-
ceived a first reading Wednesday
night and which will be decided this
afternoon, alters radically Section 7
of article 5 of Council's constitution
which reads:

“In the College or School of Educa-
tion at least one of their two repre-
sentatives shall be a woman. If two
men receive the highest number of
votes, the lowest one shall be drop-
ped and the woman with the highest
number of votes having the same
classification as the man dropped,
shall take his place.”

Goldberg's amendment would have
WSGA elect two women from the en-
tire school in the spring election to
sit in Council as women's representa-
tives. This move would bring the
total number of councilors to 14.

The main objection to the article
as it stands in the present constitu-
tion is that the women constitute
one-fifth of the enrollment in the
College and in the School of Educa-
tion, yet are able to control half of
the representation.

Goldberg's amendment would allow
VVSGA to carry on the election of the
two women representatives, one ju-
nior and one senior, at the general
election of WSGA ofﬁcers in the
spring. Thus, the defeated candi-
dates for WSGA council representa-
tive posts cannot run for Council
posts from the schools. The women
who are elected through the WSGA
election will not be eligible for in-
ternal elections in Council.

Discussion
of the amendment showed a divided
Council. It was suggested that the
affair be brought up to WSGA at that
group's meeting yesterday. Deﬁnite
opposition appeared to the consulta-
tion with ‘WS-GA on the amendment
since it would give that group two
members on Council where WSGA
now has only one, and would allow
the women more representatives if
they could control enough votes to
swing the elections in the College
and the School of Education. Wo-
men would have the opportunity to
elect six councilors under the new
amendment. ' _.

Aroused over the suggestion that
VVSGA should be consulted, Goldberg
said, “WSGA has taken a too high-
handed attitude on matters between
the two groups. This amendment
gives them the power to increase
their ability to elect more members
to Council if they can.”

Goldberg showed a. clever parlia-
mentary trump card when he pre-
sented a petition for a special meet-
ing of Council this afternoon signed
by ﬁve members of the group. The
special meeting to give the amend-
ment its second reading will take
place at 5 o'clock this afternoon in
room 801. Cathedral of Learning. It
will take a two-thirds vote of Council
to pass the amendment.

Customs regulations came up again
when Arthur Goldberg presented a
plan which had been passed unani-
mously by Druids, sophomore men's
honorary activities fraternity.

The outline of the plan suggests
that all freshmen be forced to wear
a brass pin bearing the numerals of
the class. The brass pin will be worn
until the freshman wins his silver
pin after passing an examination in
University songs and yells.

In order to “put teeth into the
idea" the Druids propose that no
freshman shall be eligible for any ac-
tivity until he has won his silver pin.
The plan also provides for a fresh-
man class organization which will
have control of social and other
events and suggests that the class be
divided into 30 groups each meeting
with a Druid adviser.

“This will give the. Druids 3. def-
inite function on the campus," said
Goldberg as he proposed . the plan.
The suggestion also intends to have
the group sponsor an essay contest
on "How May Pitt Be Improved” for-
a prize of 10 dollars.

Theta members and friends go stiﬁ
shirt and low-back with a vengeance.

For the Phi Eps, it's the twentieth
annual Spring formal, and they go out
to the Shannopin Country Club to
dance to the Ipana Troubadors. The
SAM’s make a much shorter journey,
going across the street from the chap-
ter house on Center avenue -to the
Haddon Hall ballroom where Paul
Reiter’s Serenaders blow out the fox
trots and moaning waltzes. In their
case, it's a Prosperity dance, -with all
that ‘goes with it——except, of course,
that dark brown liquid.

The Thetas have also deserted their
chapter -house for tonight, to recipro-
cate to their boy friends for all those
dates at the Longue Vue Farms. Wal-
den Richard's ten-piece-orchestra. will
occupy the band ‘shell.

Festival Dance At Grotto

 

By Charles

B. Holstein

With tickets marked at $1.50 per couple, a new low for a. major
University dance, with two orchestras staging a battle of music, with
the new and immense Grotto ballroom as the site, and with an al-

together Spring-like atmosphere

standing affair of the year's social program, if the plans of Dan

predominating, the dance of the
ill be the most elaborate and out.-

Smith, Eng. '33, Festival chairman; Ansel McCamant, Dent. '33,

dance chairman, and of
co1nmi.ttee are carried out. .

The first meeting of Smith, Mc-
Camant, and the Festival committee
chairmen resulted in the appoint.ment
of 38 students to the dance commit-
tee, representing an six schools of
the University, stamping the dance as
the first and only all-University affair
of the -year.

The ball ha_s been moved back one
evening from ~Thursday,' May 4 to Fri-
day, May 5, placing it in the curtain
of events
scheduled for Spring Festival week.
As the ﬁnal affair‘ on the program, it
is depended upon to -close the Fes-
tival week with the proverbial bang.
-At least 800 -couples are expected to
attend. v

band concert scheduled for that time
generously oifered to move that event
back to Thursday night. Smith and
M.cCa.n1ant have extended their ap-
preciation for this act.

It will be a Sport Dance, say Smith
and McCamant,

by the chairman. Last year, how-
ever, guests were invited to attend
with or without coats, with rolled up
shirt sleeves, and minus ties.

The ballroom, the Grotto Club on
the North Side, is reputed to be the
newest and largest in this section of
the State. Guests at the Engineering
Association affair and the Mardi
Gras reacted favorably to the floor.
The many vari—hued spotlights border-
ing the dance ﬂoor are capable of
more than 30 different color combin-
ations, and the festival chairmen
state that these -effects will be aug-

mented with a number of other’ noveli

decorative features.

Smith has called a meeting for to-
day at 4:30 -o'clock, of all
committee members connected with
the Festival, including the ﬂoat
parade, the track meet, the publicity,

will be selected entirely from mate-}

“It is rare that we in Ainerica have
an opportunity to see the master-
pieces of the art of the Far East.” ex-

plziined Pi'ofessoi' Hovey. in describ-'

ing the purpose of the exhibit. “The

teziiii that should be on a par with

The schedule, which includes l)u-

opens April 21, with the Duquesne

that beer is a. lllGl12lCe to the \velfare

No Beer Here

-CTION taken within the past few days by the Board of Trustees
and student groups represented in _Interfratcrnity Council indi-

cates that beer is to have no official

existfencc zit thc"U11ivcrsit._v. Sili-

dent rea.ction to the prohibitive. edict, one of unconccrn, if ;-in_vthing,
provides the only element of surprise in the matter.

It has been made plain that the trustees have no intention of
permitting‘ the University to become the scene of any sale, consump-

tion or advertising of alcoholic beverages.

Surprisingly, the only

bowed heads noticed among undergraduates were those of publica-

tions executives.

The gleam of expectancy died in the eyes of at

least three student business Inanagers when it became known that

beer advcrtisinog was to bc cxclud

And one need not be a. business inauagcr to appreciate the loss and .

their reasons for mourning.
One can hardly argue that it is

cd from all student piiblications.

not the 1‘ig'l'it and p'rivilcg'c of the

trustees to safeguard the name and reputation of the Univci-si.t,v

under the existing conditions. It

the sale or use of alcoholic bcvemgcs on l..Tnivcrsit.y property as it is l

is as much their right to control

their right to say that no person shall deface. the walls of Alumni

Ilall. Similarly, one may justif'_v

the restriction applying to sale

or consumption by student Ol’§_;'£l'il.lZ€illOllS chartered in the name. of

the University.

There will be no public howl by fratcrn.it_v men on Intcrfratcr-

nity Council’s action to safcgi1a1'cl

the interests of the f1'atcrnitics.

Council, naturally, acted to protect its own standing in the eyes of

the public.

Their rccoxnmcnclation, it should be noted, was made

l}e.t'orc any of the representatives voting had learned of the decision

of the -trustees’ GXefEilllV'C"‘(30iil1Ilit’fb€.l

Just as campus fraternities

cannot afford to suffer any ill consequences of beer legalization, so it

may be said of the University.
No mention of eni'orccmcnt ac

companicd the rules set forth by

the trustees. Instead, deans and administrative. ofﬁcers were direct-
od to seek the co-operation of student. activities and orgfa.ni.zatious.
Since the.fraternities already are committed, and the activity groups
are likewise interested in their own welfare, it is unlikely that there

will ever be an enforcement problc
‘Nith cvcr_v restaurant and gr
thirst, there is no reason why our r

m.
ill prepared to‘ slakc the student
ambling campus should be turned

into a “glorified beer ,9;a1'(lcn.” The _.0_.;cuc1'a.l acceptance of this feel-

ing is best shown by the fact that

all the student cries of “\Vhat.!

No Boer?” have been voiced with a. chuckle of marked indifference.

* A Key For Every Vest


Ainiiiiiries. Student Council, we
of distinction, has broken with. the

NEW key graces the vest-froiits of a small band of campus lu-

learn, has slipped from its ledge
tradition of its colorful past and

joined the growing ranks of the undcrgra.dua.te gold hoarder,

This emblem of our legislators
striking contrast of gold and black

is indeed :1 thing of beauty. The
enamel--t.h.c same which a.nn1uilly

captivates the high school senior--cauglit the fancy of these intel-
lectual but not entirely unaesthctic representatives of our student

body. .. -
The symbolic

scales of justice and the words “Student Council”

--both connoting wisdom, truth and might, and commanding: a less
sensitive world to inarticulate worship—~wcrc incorporated into the
design of this piece of ornamentation Let none suggest what hap-
pens to black enamel when live or more ko_vs~—thc usual number

worn by campus “big shots”--get

position on that sadly over-weighted watch chain.

How much more ﬁtting and practical it might have been for
Student Council to have voted each member a ﬁve-dollar meal ticket

group has not eaten “on the budget” once this year. At least. Coun-

Betty Quarrie, our favorite in “En-

fering an amusing‘ bit as Lulu, the
Negro maid. Charles Foreman and
Dorothy Getsinger were commendable
as Fred and Nettie Minick. Barbara

and Morton Harris pleased as young
Minicks’ friends. ‘Miss Elson offered
a commical incident when, over the
telephone, she tells her child to take
his finger out of his mouth.

John Neary and Forest Alter were

Information on the uses» to which
money donated by American college
and university students is being ap-
plied at Lingnan University, Canton.

past ten years, last year receiving ap-
proximately $200 from the campaign.

Oriental Exhibition
VV'e look forwarcl with much pleas-

ure to the Fine _-Xrts Department's
second public exhibition at Heinz
House. The previous exhibition

early in winter was the first of its
kind ever sponsored at the University,
and issued with a strong cleclaraiioii
of the integrity of modern art, re-
hearsing once more the glories of
Cezanne, Renoir, Gauguin, Van Gogh,
and disclosing the spirit of enterprise
and delight in the Picasso experi-
ments as well as the revolutionary
accent of the “i‘auves.” VVe look for
something different this time. We
shall forget our d_\-‘napmic landscapes,
our cubists, futurists, and sur-realists
and swing to the other hemisphere of
Japanese and Chinese art.

The exhibition will occupy the
whole of Heinz House. The field of
art here is a large one, strange, ex-
ceedingly interesting, and the Fine
Arts Department has drawn upon ex-
tensive resources to take in the
whole scope of it. Paintings, sculp-
tures, po_,iter_v, textiles, prints will be

them seldom seen in this country.
They are executed on long rolls of
silk where yards and yards of misty,
mountainous Seacoast takes one back
to the dreary minds of the Orientals
——to the artist whose meticulousness
extends to the smallest hair and to
the patron who reverently consented
to uuroll his masterpiece on only the
most unusual occasions. One of the
most beautiful examples of Tibetan
religious painting is included, an or-
iginal on cloth. showing a Buddhistic
conception of the universe.

There will be many Japanese
prints. \‘\.7'e are most familiar with
this side of oriental art. Many of the
prints and reproductions will include
the Inasterpieces most generally ad-
mired iu the west. Besides tliesc,
l'e1)l'O(ll1('llOiiS of Oriental pottery, in-
cluding tiles and porcelaius, will be
shown, as well as examples of fabrics.

Though the si-a..ut of this exhibition
is almost directly opposite from our
moderus, it will be equally interest-
ing in every way. No one ought to
miss it. It is an aesthetic disclosure
of .Iap-anese and Chinese culture from
200  B. C. forward and is, be-
sides, one of the completest of its
kind to be found outside the l€i.l‘_£','Q1'
museums. The exhibition will open
around ten 0'r:l0Cl{ Monclay morning,
and will close at "five 1). 111. Tea will
be served and everyone is asked to
attend.

The orie-utal posters announc-
ixig the exhibition were designed
and executed by Miss Virginia 1.
Cuth‘oer't. at student in the De-
partincnt and already an artist of

‘ considerable distinction, They
represent 21 highpoint in poster
making in a year that has been
marked by especially ﬁne work
along this line.

Photographic Show

In connection with this exhibition
one must mention the photographic
salon show at the Ca1‘11egie Galleries.
This is a Convincing example of the
place where photography breaks with
mere IIl‘.?!l'3ll3!ll(‘,€Ll perception and be-
comes nrt. All types of photographs
are repre-.s~ented, ranging from the re-
captured wistfulncss of Italian ma-
donnas down to the latest electric
i:rausi’oriuer. One recognizes the
suitability of the camera to represent

the d1'a.matic .-ﬁ>isl1es- of modern. life.

'.i.‘l1e sharp blacks and whites,
shadows, and in-ight, dynamic sliafts
of stone are peculiarly our own. '.l‘hc
show will extend till the ﬁfteenth of
the. month.

ed the growth in Nazi power that
gbe-came a threat in 1930. After a
;temporary loss, he pointed out, the
I-Iitlerites reached the greatest
six-ene;1':i1 ever attained by 21 German
party in March of this year.

“For all practical purposes,” Dr.
Gruper (lecla.1'ed_ “The \Veimar (‘ou-
siitution was abolished last summer.
The (‘-erma.n people have been con-
vinced by an intense propaganda cam-
paign that the Republic has failed.
and have accordingly rscponded to the
siren songs of Hitler’s aides."

The speaker continued, “Hitler
would probably not be in power now
if the Allies had not been so harsh
in the Versailles Treaty. Certainly
no spirit of brotherly love actuated
them, and this Fascist regime is Ger-
mau_v’s answer."

According to Dr. G1'a.per.v Hitler’s

lent. In order to keep together his
lforccs, he has “stressed racial purity
'as the big; noise that keeps the minds
of the people away from real issues.
Probably persecution of the Jews has
gone too far,” he added. “but Hitler
cannot undo in two weeks what has
_been carefully built up in ten years.”
“But the most.‘ surprising fact"-in
the entire situation," the political
scientist stated, “is the weakness of
the Communists and the Socialists in
this crisis. There has been no united
opposition to the rise-of.F-ascism."

strutted across the stage displaying
a. variety of evening gowns, tuxedos,
sport dresses and jackets, polo coats,
Englisli drapes, ‘monkey’ hats, and all
the other synonyms of well dressed
youth, while Fred Ford’s eleven—piece
orchestra played appropriate tunes in

The interval between the showing
