Mellon] Institute Makes I
    Marvelous Progress

 

Five years ago the industrial fellow-

ship system of the Mellon Institute,

now so well known, was inaugurated
by the late Robert Kennedy Duncan.

Today the system is a model from .;
V which many other
copied. The purpose of the industrial ’

fellowship system has for its purpose
the -increasing of lefﬁciency of Ameri-
can industry by co-operation between
industry and learning. V I '

The first fellowship was the result
of a grant by a baking écompany which
desired to improve its product. This
‘grant was used as has all others con-

tributed to fellowships, with the ex-V
ception: of small sums. for the pur-

chase of apparatus and cheinicals, to

secure the services of a man who has

shown a gift for research, to devote

all‘ his time to certain problems con-

nected with the baking industry.
Since the establishment of the first

fellowship, 47 distinct concerns have

endowed some one hundred and Vﬂve
one-year fellowships. These «concerns

iididthis believing the Mellon IV-nstitute 7

.-had and could use all the *aVdv.a.nta.ges

and opportunties known ‘to iscVience,l.

institutions have -.

  

for the solution of their particular
problems. The new building is the
most complete industrial experiment
station in the country and this added
 the services of the skilled chemists,
fives splendid advantages for this
otk. .

 'f his table shows the number of fel-
Tlovyships employed, and the amount of

   
   

.,.gnoney contributed by the concerns.‘

of each ten problems assigned to the

institute for study weresolved to the -

satisfaction of the donors. That the
concerns placed reliance in the work
is shown. by the fact that a large

number of the fellowships were re-’

newed. I Twenty-ﬁve patents have been
granted to the holders of fellowships
and there are as many more pending.

the day, within a ypar or two, at most“,

_ ’ ‘Recently Columbia. and Barnard, and
Hunter College, from which New York
gets many of its best teachers, got out
intercollegiate magazine which
proved to be vastly different fromthe.
usual run of college publications. L
A young woman wrote a simple plea
for courses in women’s colleges which
would help. girls later to be intelligent
mothers. She didnot poetize about it-.
She said: “What is to determine. our
attitude toward eugenics, birth coni;rol,.
the Montessori system, twilight sleep,
infant mortality, and the many mod‘-L
ern studies made on these subjects if
we have but ameagre eLducatio'n along
these lines?” And when were” they
going to prepare to face these-subjects
unless theybegan as girls-. L L l
I. Columbia and Barnard rocked with
the storm these young radicals raised,

I

bid-den to be sold. Two Hunter College
contributors were i ordered to sever
their; connection I with the editorial
staff. A A

.Tho_collége heads, as usual,’ are

qultefwrong in their attitude toward A
sLtuLden..t ra..dicaL-1ism.— Instead pf trying J
V to suppress a magazine of this kind

and punishing -the Lwriters, the profes-
sors ought to be proud of their-work,
for radicalism in young people is a
sign that they are -learning to think. L

= The college thatturns out thinking
students is ‘a successful college. 
other kind is a; failure,- As for the
radical character of students’ thoughts,
no one need worry about that. Young
people ought to -be ~ra.dical=. -Few of

able drama of the race problem in the
South “The Nigger” is pr,odu«ced by
the}-Iariry Davis Players, at the Grand
Opera House week of April 10th, Ed-
ward E. Horton, the ver' atile and pop-
ular leading man will i ave the most
picturesque and effective characteriza-
tion that he has yet portrayed in
Pittsburgh. It was this play which
_established Guy Bates“ Post as a s-tar
in the 7dram.~atic;Lﬁrm'a.n1ent and also
brought fame to its young author, Ed-
ward E; ‘Sheldon, -who has since writ-
ten a number of Broadway successes,
notably “Romance” for Doris Keane;
and “The Gipsy” for Margaret Anglin;

Mr. Horton in the role created’ by
Mr. Post, whi-c is‘ that of Philip Mor-
row, the Southern Governor, who D in
the midst ofihis political triumph and
his success in winning the-Iheart and
hand of a, fair young Southern girl,
learns that he has negro blood inhis
veins. 'lL‘ho‘seL who saw the ‘perform-
ances.’-of the play at the Alvin several
seasons ago will recall‘_tL;LheI really re-
markable delineation of. the difficult
role by Mr. Bost which gives anticipa-
tion of a splendid characterizaition by
Mr. Horton. - ‘ L ‘A

Mr. HarryDavis made  a.rra.nIge-
ment with the Messrs-. ShubeLrtL and
Wm. A. Brady for the original version
of ’ “'l‘ihe Nigger” and Stage Director
Dennie Harris’ will give the production
exact to the «smallest detail as it was
given here at the Alvin. by the original
-cast a few years -ago. I

by . PTA The Easter holiday season is going
 l to _be,a very active one for Pitt Club
 M‘, "affairs. At least one new club will be
p M .for’meTd—-in the Kiski Valley-— and it
 is also likely that the Pitt men and
_ j T  , women of ‘Youngstown will gather and
  perfect an organization. The former
  is sure and the latter will be decided
.  this week; ‘T p A '
T  In addition to this, there’ will be

three other club aﬁairs,»the Beaver
H County club having its ﬁrst annual
T  dance at the Junction Pavilion, be-
, .j,7jtween Rochester and New Brighton,

When I-Iugus cleared the bar at 5
feet 11 inches, he raised the Univer-
sity record for the high jump to a.
respectable height. The former record
of 5 feet 8% inches was hardly a
credit to the school. At «the rate the
Charleroi youth is going this record
will probably be -also broken soon.

Burwell in breaking the record for
the 50 yard dash had to beat two
former record‘ holders at that dis-
tance; C'arr.oll, who was -in school, for
a time and Gano,‘ the star from In-
diana Normal.

 

The most surprised man in the meet
was the Philadelphia speeder who
was passed and left yards behind by
Albright, the new phenomenon scour.-
ed by the University this year. How
the slightly‘ built Buckeyite. made up
all the distance he did and then gained
ten’/to’ twelve yards on the ﬁeld is
still .a wonder to the spectators.

 

Poor Tech! After furnishing medals
for the first three places ‘in all the
events and a cup to each‘ member on
the winning relay ‘team, the unfortu-
nate 'ScotS. were unable to win any-
thing but a very poor third in the re-
lay and a. third in one of the runs.

 

' And now" fo-r baseball! remember
the ﬁrstgacme last year? Pitt 18, Car-.
negie Tech 2, or something like that.
And then the year before. when Am-
mons and Beattie planted. about eight
home runs on the hill back ofmMellon’s

The announcement that the Co-eds
have taken up track and ﬁeld events
and training for them has awakened
fear in‘ the hearts of the"Dents._Who1
had visions‘ of winning the School‘
honors7again thisyear. Oneof the
fair athletes’ is said to have run the
100 in a. little less than nothing, and to
have cleared the bar at 5 feet 5 inches.

tend a banquet to beheld at the Uni-
versity of Syracuse at which it. is
hoped to ‘get all members of Camp”s
A.ll American eleven for the past year.
At this dinner given by the Athletic
Associationof the University, a large
numben of prep school athletes are in
attendance as guests of the organiza*-‘'‘
tion. Camp is supposedto be there
this year and to make the principal
speech. 1 , _1 

 

Toni Kendrickshas been appointed
manager of the wrestling team for
next year. Tom is well liked by tde
menrbers of thesquad and is one of
the best wrestlers . representing the
University. Last year. and the ﬁrst
part of this year he was competing
at 175 pounds but toward the last of
the”se'as1on‘1he trained down to 158 at
which he put up some mighty good
exhibitions. Tom‘ is a-new man‘ at
this game and should prove a star be-
1fore he "graduates. Besides being a
‘wrestler Kendrick is «.:one:_ of the
s_trong1est .line men on the football
eleven; and is “Bob”. Peck’1s under-
study. P 1  A

 

The announcement {that ‘Coach
Reineke will be on hand this spring
to take charge of the candidates for
the mat squad should mean that next
‘year the Gold and Blueisquad and
team will. be one that s1hquld make
them all hustle. . 1 The record this year-
was not one to brag about, but con-
sidering the time put in and .the‘ num-
ber of men out, it is surprising that
they made as good showing as they
did. 1 I 1‘ .

 

Strange how quiet the Panther is
these days. There has‘ not beeneven
as much as a whine from its lain
since the memorable day thatthe Pitt
Weekly's second team drubbed them

that was thesoore when the account-

Both. of these men starred in every
one of the games played this year and
their record, considering the class of

markable. The places will be hard to

TRACK MEN mu:
HARD SPRINE MEET

The next three months will be im-
portant ones for the track men as
there are seven’ meets scheduled for
them in April, May, and June, not in-
cluding several local meets in which
they will probably be entered. The
ﬂrst of the scheduled meets is the
Philadelphia Relays at Philedelphia
on April 29. On. May 6, Syracuse will
send a team here for a dual-meet with
our men, in return for the meet held
at Syracuse last month to which we
sent a large quota of men; A much
better showing will be «made at1this
time than was made at the earlier

 

event ‘because of the fact that we will 1

have a much larger. number of ath-
letes entered and they will be in much
better condition.

.0n the 13th we -have our annual
contest with Tech, which should not
prove as difficult assome of the other
.contests,. The In'terco.l1egiate Meet

. with Pitt and State as the «principal 1

contestants will be held on the 20th, in
this city. The 27th of May is an open
d1ate,1but it will probably be; ﬁlled be-.
fore that time.
travel to Washington on the“ 3d of
June and will hold a dualcontest with
W.‘& J. in conjunction with the base-

,‘ ball game between our» baseballers

and thoseof the Red and Black.‘ The
12th of June will see them at State
where they will attempt to carry off

the honors in track as they have -done
in football and basketball. _

The ‘Freshman menmbers of the team
are making a ‘fine showing this year.
and are expected to lower severalof
the records before they have ﬁnished
their Work h-ere. They were com-
paratively green, men as far as track
is co»ncerned,.when they entered this
institution, but ‘Coach Kerr has de-
veloped a ﬁne bunch of runners. There
are ﬁve men from the Class of 1919
who have shown up especially well
and " who will probably make their
letters this season. They are: Al-
bright, a smiler and half-miler, ‘Hugus
from Bellefonte Academy, I who has
become a star h‘igh-jumper, and who
lowered the University Record in that
event last month by 53 inches, clear-
ing the ‘bar at '5 ft. 11 in. Easterday,
the pole-vaulter who looks like areal
ﬁnd; ,.Jo-rdan, .a_ hurdler and Wiegel,

ru"nn1e1rs. The latter part of ‘themionth
will witness the ,Interd.e—p1artment'.Meet
at which time it is expected that sev-
eral new andvaluable track men will
be found who havenot as yet found
themselves as runners. . G

We have the word of Mr. Miller and
Coach Kerr to the effect that our
team this year is the strongest and
best balanced of any that has ever
represented this University, notwith-
standing the lossof Capt. McMasters.
The only weak spot is the hurdles, but
with a little more time spent in train-
ing the new men, this will be taken
care of. With such a. team as this
.one to represent uswe need not wor-

ry about having a very successful sea»

son. Although it is a very hard mat-
ter to predict the result this early in
the year, with the success of previous
years‘ taken into.c0.nSideration, who
can say that it can beotherwise than
successful. A I

Coach Reinecke  ,Will Have
Charge of Men During April-
and May.  1‘

 

 

Announcement has been made by the
athletic authorities o1f the University
that Coach Charles Reinecke of the

‘wrestling squad will be on hand for
the two months of April and May and
will hold spring practise for the ..ath-,
letes in this branch of sport. 1 Practices
will be held every day from now on.
until the ﬁrst of June. , _
This announcement will be received
by the lovers ofthe mat sport with
much satisfaction as there has always
been a feeling that the Univensity
would never have a real. wrestling
squad until more time was given to
developing the men in this line of
sport. Fonnnierly, the coach would
come around right after the football
season closed and then in the short
time available he would have to get,
the men out and train them in not
only the fundmentals but also in the
more complex phases of the game.

two years in succession it was found
anced team organized in the short
time available. ~ . . '
However, it is proposed'1to get the
men to come out and to learn theﬁne
points of the game so” that when
next fall starts. andpthe callis made
th-e ‘men that will report will not be
green horns. This is the one sport
in which the University teams have
not made a good showing this schol-
astic year and in this way it is hoped
to turn out .a. team that will compare
with ‘our other star teams. ‘
C All men whovhave’ been out for
wrestling and all those that would
like to take a try at this sport should
report new. ‘ .

the feature. of the entire evening was

theprelnarlkable performance of Welk-

«on his ﬁnal sprint, and when he cross- ’

ed the tape his nearest oDl3Onent was

by the Ohian marks him out as a man

who is liable to threaten’ the 440, and
