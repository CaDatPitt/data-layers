Nyden Speech Request

BY BILL MOORE

The wife of assistant sociology
professor Paul Nyden interrupted a
meeting of the Board of Trustees
yesterday to askthat the Student
Committee to Defend Paul Nyden
be allowed to address the meeting.

Linda Nyden, a graduate student
in history, asked Board chairman
William Rhea to allow her to speak
for 15 minutes about her husband’s
battle to retain his teaching job.

Rhea denied her request.

She refused to be seated for
about 10 minutes, continuing.her
verbal appeal. “We feel that
students should be allowed to
discuss the case for 15 minutes.
That is all we ask,” she said.

Rhea said it would be “inappro-

priate” for the Board to hear

testimony on the Nyden case
because they may be asked ‘to rule
on it at a later date. _He -also

Studio Arts  
Independent
Study Cut

BY TOBI ROSEN

A lack of student expertise and
studio arts department facilities
has prompted the cancellation of all
studio art independent study
courses starting this winter term.

Nearly one fourth of 80 studio

arts majors are currently taking ‘

independent study courses.
According to studio arts depart-
merit chairman Virgil Cantini,
“The amount of work put forward
is not worthy of three credits. It’s

easier for students to get by ,_

without doing. an outstanding job.”
Cantini expressed “disappoint-
ment” with the poor quality of
work. He attributed some, of the
deﬁciency to the lack of supervision
for independent study projects“

“The students can’t perform on  

a level called ‘independent study,’
assistant studio arts professor Girts
Purins agreed. He said the
program isn’t producing the results

, expected. -

Purins cited alack of sculpture

and painting‘ facilities to cater to- 

the “qualified” students’ needs.

In addition, with nearly 1,500 '

Pitt students taking studio arts

courses each term, the faculty must .

weigh the demands of non-major
introductory art classes against the

demands of the independent study

“He was only performing his

Posvar said later that he had

The -Pitt Campus Police are
petitioning the state of Pennsyl-
vania for an alternative to

provisions in the new State Motor - _

Vehicle Code that _prohibits them
from issuing parking tickets but
permits the city police to ticket on
University property, Campus Po-
lice Chief Curt Graham said.
Under the old state Motor Vehicle
Code, which expired July 1,
Campus Police were empowered to
issue parking ticket violations on
University property, according to
Graham.

‘‘It would really be a change in
criminal procedure, not a law,”
Graham said. “All the money
would still go to the state.”

While waiting for the court’s
decision, the Campus Police
presently give warnings for parking
violations on University property,
according to Graham.

“Without ﬁnes or penalties,”
Graham said, f‘the warnings just

‘ don't work.”

“You mightwas woe_ll_s say anybody

can’t ticket anybody, we can’t tow
them away or it would be larceny,”
patrolman Regis Mentkowski said.

to a recent survey by the National

“The increases are operating as

After Linda Nyden gave up her

awarded directly to the school,
according to the number of eligible
students, ‘ and not to the student.”

There are approximately 10,0001

students participating in financial
aid programs at Pitt, according to
Pitt’s Dean of Admissions and
Student Aid Kenneth Wenger.

“Pitt attempts to develop a
package of aid for needy students,”
Wenger said. “We try to combine
grant money from PHEAA with
federal aid programs to help

students meet their educational

costs,” he said. '

The federal aid programs . Pitt
receives money from include the
Basic Grant and the Campus Based
programs.

The Basic Grant, classiﬁed as the
Entitlement Program, is a grantfor
needy students, operating on a

1 federal budget ‘of $1.5 billion, .
Reeher said.

It will award in the
neighborhood of two million grants
this year, he said.

Campus Based federal funds
encompass three different student
aid opportunities: the National
Student Direct Loan; the Student
Educational Opportunity Grant;
and the College Work Study
Program. All three, Reeher said,
are awarded on the basis of need.
Unlike the others, each is adminis-
tered by the schools’ Student Aid
ofﬁce, he said.

The procedure for determining
"how much aid, if any, a student at
Pitt will be awarded is very
complex, said Pitt’s acting Director
of Student Aid Frank Dutkovich.

“Students applying for ﬁnancial
aid , from Pitt must ﬁle the
appropriate applications to either
PHEAA, the federal government or
our ofﬁce, depending on the type of

. aid the student is seeking. Eligi-

bility is then determined by a needs
analysis performed by the respec-
tive student-aid agency or ofﬁce,”
Dutkovich said. _

Dutkovich said Pitt then exam-
ines the eligibility reports and
awards a package of student aid
based on need.

‘p‘We are forced to stretch our
student aid dollars very thinin an

_atter_np‘t - toifprovipde as many .
- . students .as, possible with- help  

meeting their educational costs,”
Dutkovich said.

Students seeking help with their
educational costs can .also apply for
Senatorial Scholarships, Dutkovich
said. Each state senator is allowed
to award 24 scholarships to each of
several schools in Pennsylvania,
Pitt included, he said.

As a ﬁnal option, said Dutkovich,
students seeking ﬁnancial I aid
should contact their local banks for
information on the PHEAA loar
program. This program was
designed by the state to assist

students seeking ﬁnancial aid, 1

regardless of their need, he said.

affairs committee, earlier yester-
day to ask that they be allowed to
speak. That request was denied
then because “this Board has
certain by laws which govern the
manner in which it takes up
business," Wolfe said.

“I made it clear that the matter
was not one to be discussed at this
time," Wolfe said.

Asked why she had ignored
Wolfe and Rhea and continued to
interrupt proceedings at the

meeting, Linda Nyden said “we .

never agreed that students should
not be allowed to speak.”

She also called on Posvar to
“intervene positively and say there
is no room in this University for
closed meetings and secret re-
ports.”

In other business at yesterday's
meeting, Board member K. Leroy
Irvis, a majority leader of the state
house, suggested the University
divert some of its funds through the
New World Bank and other
minority-controlled institutions.

Vice Chancellor for Business and
Finance Joseph Dutton told Irvis
that tax with-holdings from the
University payroll were already
deposited in the New World Bank.

In the Chancellor’s report,
Posvar said fall enrollment was up
by slightly under one -percent and
that the University will begin to
more actively recruit students in
coming years. ‘

The meeting concluded with a
report onthe Annual Giving Fund,
which has already exceeded $1
million. 1

CRIME RATE DECREASES

The crime rate on campus has

taken a slight dip since last year at

this time. according to Campus

Police Chief Kurt Graham.

He said the most prevalent crime
is theft and most arrests involve
people from outside the University
community.

Crime occurs equally in all areas
ol the campus. he said.

Graham said there is usually a
lull in crime between 4 and 8 o'clock
in the morning and a slight rise in
crime between 8 p.m. and 2 a.m.

Graham added crime is most
prevalent during a four-month
span from November to February.

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

 Towards A Secure Pitt

- Security around Pitt's dormitories needs beeﬁng up. That is a moot
‘point, Everybody knows someone who has been harassed while walking

through the campus after dark.

It's not that the Campus Police have been performing inadequately.
An oﬁicer cannot be in two places at once.

I And it's not that the Office of Resident Life is not trying to make Pitt as

secure as possible, either. They, too. are concerned with the students’

welfare.

Students, like any other citizens, have a right to expect safety-one
where they should not have to walk anywhere with apprehension. It
should especially be that way when one considers the premium price

students pay to live on campus.

Sopkesident Student Association (RSA) chairman Michele Sikora went
before the Student  Advisory Council (SAAC) last Monday to ask

for help.

It was there that Chancellor Wesley Posvar called for the formation of
a task force to investigate the problem. He has asked Assistant Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs William Markus, Assistant Vice

’ chancellor for Planning and Budget John Yeager and Assistant Director
- otVResident Life .10 Ann Gibbs to coordinate the task force.

’ Such a quick response by the Chancellor is to be commended, but the
‘action does create some food for thought. First, the task force needs
students and a representative of the Campus Police in its upper echelon.

’ lhey are the security needers and the security providers. Their

presence would contribute much to task force leadership.

Second, the task force has to consider how much security is needed
before it drastically changes student lifestyles. A balance is necessary.
Security is desired, but students should feel like they are in college, not

prison.‘

"lhird, the committee will have to look to the outside for help, too.
Oakland and its‘ lighting needs have changed considerably since the city
of Pittsburgh last modernized them. It is time once more for the city to“
assess the lighting needs of this area. In plenty of places, lighting is far 4

from adequate.

 lhe task force hasmuch to do, but it"also has great potential. Let's
hope it accomplishes something instead of becoming another vanising

ad hoc committee.

Letters On
School Spirit

  Majors Is Also
  Apathetic

This letter is in response to the
articles in the Pitt News concerning
Johnny Majors and his feelings on
fan support at football games. The

first article is entitled “Majors

Desires Spirit” (Oct. 8) and the
second one is ‘ ‘The Ideas on Fading
School Spirit” (Oct 13).

Both articles have presented
entirely conﬂicting views on
Majors’ opinion of fan support. The
ﬁrst article tends to make me
believe that the Pitt News has been
incorporated into the Majors realm.
This article is amateurish and it has
the tenacity to make Pitt News look
like a public relations paper written
by “Johnny Majors himself. The
second one is a commentary, which
hasu been unfazed rugby .__Majors
iconstant propaganda; This article
states exactly what Majors_ implies
and feels about the student support
of Pitt football.

I state these opinions according to
the articles previously mentioned.
On Oct. 8, Majors says that he is
“impressed with the fan support
here at Pitt” while in the Oct. 13
article he implies that Pitt students
are “jerks when it comes to

supporting the football team.”

Majors complains about student

., apathy at football games but, he

does not concern himself. with

A ﬁpaihy in atherZsports,‘i.e. soccer, .
.. _ swimming, basketball, (_.e't‘c., _'in"
*  yvhich the apathy is farvgreaﬁtervthuaht

I .

at. football games. One thing a
coach should do is not only worry
about hi own team’s support by the
studenfpopulation (which Majors
does not have to worry about yet)
but also about the other teams. This
is one thing Majors has avoided in
the past and will probably avoid in
the future. Majors himself has been
apathetic in this situation. ’

Probably the most important
reason for the apathy at Pitt in
recent years, if any, is the
bureaucratization of applying for
Pitt football tickets. At one time all
you had to do was show your Pitt
I.D. at the gate and you could enter
the game. Now, you have to fill out
different forms proving you are a
Pitt student, and, if you want to be
guaranteed a seat, you 'can
purchase a season ticket at a
nominal fee. The fee itself - is
probably unimportant, it is the time
that a student must take to get a

ticket that really is important. Since

Majors fdidnothing to stop " this
bureaucratization, he should suffer
the short-and long-term results of
this time-consuming restraint on
students. Students at Pitt should
not be subjugated to Majors’
harassments because of Majors’
apathy on the ticket issue in the
winter term of last year.

In summary, Majors should look
at his own apathy, since he is
supposed to be a leader of the Pitt
community, before he condemns
others of things he, himself, 
guilty of. -

Jennikins on Teaching

Confused, They re Respectful

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

One of the oldest traditions in
academic life is the lecture. It can
be traced back ‘to Moses who
delivered the first mass lecture in
the history of education. It was

followed by quick quiz in which‘

those who hadn't paid attention
were consumed by ﬂames and
stoned to death.

The lecture of today is remark-
ably similar to those lectures of
yesterday. Though embellished by
centuries of criticism and innova-
tion, it is essentially the same form,
analogous to certain microorgan-
isms and lizards that have craftily
maintained their position in evolu-
tion through countless ice ages and

I small mammals.

The subject of theglecture came
up by way of a ranting speech

delivered by a professor, Samuel Q. _

Jennikins to the uncaring and

decaying’ regulars of a retrograde’

bar on the outskirts of the campus.
Jennikins, having polished off
two pitchers of foamy “breakfast,

was asked where he was headed .

‘ No Reason For
Student Apathy

I agree with your article “The

Ideas on Fading School Spirit,” 0

dated Oct. 13, 1976, concerning
Pitt students’ lack of enthusiasm
for their football team. I think that
it’s a damn shame that an
outstanding football team has a
player (Tony Dorsett) who will
probably break the all-time NCAA
career rushing record and win the
Heisman Trophy and that isranked
number two in the nation, lacks the
support and enthusiasm it deserves
from its fans. _
As it was pointed out, there
seems to be no reason for apathy
.that Pitt students have towards
football. School administrators
shouldn't have to meet to arrive at
solutions that enthuse the fans.
(Other teams in the nation that are

ranked fartlower than'P'itt don’t‘

seem -to have this “gridiron
apathy” problem.
It’s really not fair to the players.
Fan support is very important to
the players. Fans’ enthusiasm and
support or lack of it affects a team’s
performance on the field. If the
fans are not supporting the players,
the players seem to just go
through the motions, they don’t put
out and the game is lackluster. On

grunt of disinterest. -

“How dare you grunt at the
lecture’ ’ J ennikins said, appalled at
the ridicule. “The lecture stands as
one u of the finest creations of
Western Civilization." Men who
have mastered every other art quail
before this«- kind of challenge.
Veterans of the worst kind of foreign
wars snivel at the thought of facing
a class of lumpish undergrad-
iuates.”

'7 Lolita, the 89-year-old vamp who
holds court at the bar, broke a
yellow grin. She ﬂicked her ivory
cigarette holder and sneered.
“Big deal,” she saidand went
back to her conversationvwith the
Trotskyite who insists on sitting in
the very darkest "reaches of the
barroom, his face to the front door.
“I remember myfirst lecture,”
Jennikins said hotly, casting a’

drunken, butbaleful glare in the '

direction of the sensous septuagen-
arian. “There I was, but a frail
teaching assistant in the depart-
ment, faced’ with three or four
hundred unqaring, bovine students.
I handed out my dittoed lecture
notes so they could follow along and
they promptly went to sleep.”

J ennikins shook his head, stirring

a few strands of white hair. “I was A

simply shattered by the experience.
In my desperationl turned to the
blackboard, even stooped to using
multi-colored chalk, Still the class
remained sullen. They jeered at my
penny loafers and made fun of my
walk. One vile member of the
athletic squad-played a kazoo in the
back of the room.”

Jennikins’ _voice shook at the
memory of the scam. A blush
appeared in splotches on his face,
wherever the blood could find an
-intact capillary.

“Finally I gave up. I began to
deliver my lecture as quickly I as
possible, even to" the point of
dropping verbs to speed things
along. ‘To save time I referred to
foreign publications in the original
language. I condensed graphs into
a smear of numbers on the
blackboard.” ‘

' Jennikin’s face cut a thin, cold
smile.

“And ‘damn me to community

had them begging for, information,
crawling for explanations. I had to
stand around at the end of class to
answer their pitiful questions. I had

himself to a personal toast, and
dumped half a glass of beer into his
open mouth. A

“That’s when I learned the real
art of lecturing,” Jennikins said
-with an arched eyebrow to Lolita.
“It’s a matter of power. Hand it to
them on a silver platter and they’ll
go away laughing. Make them work

‘ for it, and they’ll come on hands and

knees.”

“lthought lectures were suppos-

bartender said, cleaning his f'mger-

Jennikins ventured a condes-

Intolerance Is
Not Justified

lhe university “scientists" (now
numbering nine) do not enhance the
status of a "great university" by
continuing their dubious attack on

.Associate Provost Robert Nossen's

inlormal noncredit course on the
“Darker Side ofthe Supernatural.”
A lew of the specifics in their latest
proiiuncianiento deserve further
response:

It should not be necessary to
include in any course description
such academically legitimate words
as "Iiistorical-literary-sociological-
anthropological," etc. When a
laculty member announces “no
texts, but supplemental readings,"
the assumption is that the faculty
member (in good standing) has

‘decided the readings are worth

attention. Unless the critics have
themselves examined the readings,
and are prepared to make a case
that both the readings and the
laculty member are inappropriate,
they have no protest to make. .

It is tragically amusing that the
"scientists" focus on such words as
"astrology" and “alchemy," given
the backgrounds of many of the
latliers of modern science. Newton
began his workvia the study of
astrology and, during the period
when he was writing the Principia,
spent at least 12 weeks a year

-practicing alchemy; as late as the
second edition, he argued that all
elements could be transformed into
each other. To quote Keynes,

_l\ewtoii‘s “deepest instincts were -

occult, esoteric, semantic," Kepler
was an astrologer and numerologist
who developed his laws of planetary
motion on the basis of an
‘assumption that the planets were
alive, each incorporating a guardian
angel who alone. could bear its
Descartes had a series of
revelatory dreams which he took as
a divine sign that he was destined

to found a new science of nature.
Today, of course, we ignore all of -

that, but who is to say that these
"founding fathers” were incorrect
in outlining the sources of their own
theories? ’

‘it also might be noted that our
own founding fathers, those who
produced The Federalist as‘ an
explanation‘ of the 'U.S. Constitu-
tion, referred many times to similar
sources of human behavior. ‘Under
“human nature," the index to my
edition of The Federalist contains
the following number of entries:
“dark side of human nature,” 14;
“irrationality," 2; "passions of
human nature," 14. If a belief in
such phenomena had much to do
with the writing of our Constitution,

why should some attention to the .

possible sources of the phenomena
be out of bounds? Since the
dictionary directly relates the

definition of the “METAPHYSIE-;
CAL" TO "supernatural" (Web--

ster's New Collegiate), Nossen's
ollering could just as easily be titled
"Darker Side of the Metaphysical, ' '
thus making it unquestionably
relevant in both intellectual and
political terms‘ (not that these
catagories need be mutually
exclusive). The banner of “modem
science" does not justify intoler-
ance, and it is sad to see the Pitt
group making .things worse with
each new statement.

Socialism Not

Nyden Issue

I must disagree with many of the
recent letters concerning Paul
Nyden. The issue involved in this
case is not whether or not Nyden
has socialist leanings or whether or
not socialist organizations are
supporting him. The issue is not
that students have set up a
committee to support Nyden. The
issue is not even the tenure
procedure of the University. All of
these are a part of the problem, but
the real issue goes much deeper
and is much more basic.

We are all a part of a University '

community. Such a community
should function as a forum for the
free ﬂow of ideas. In order to

-become responsible adults, we_

W E 

 

 

 

must examine varying ideas and
viewpoints in order to decide what
is most relevent to our own lives.

We must throw off the simplistic
approach of seeing only one
viewpoint--our own. In order to do
this, there must be an exposure to
and a free exchange of all ideas and
viewpoints. The administration of
the University must do nothing to
restrict or inhibit this free

I exchange of ideas. To do so is to

threaten a vital part of the learning
process. It also is threatening to
one of the most valuable traditions

in education and eliminates one of

the most basic- functions of any
college or university.

The tenure system cannot be
used as a means of control over this
free ﬂow of ideas. If Nyden is in
some way academically or profes-
sionally deﬁcient, the University's
decision, to dismiss him was
correct. If, however, Nyden was
dismissed because of is political

beliefs and affiliations, he must‘ be
reinstated immediately. "The
administration of the University-
must examine itself very carefully.
For. if tenure is being used to
control the faculty and an exchange
of ideas between faculty and
students, the tenuresystem has

BY KEN GORMLEY .

(Part of being young is playing
hookey from school. We all did it

- when we were kids. whether it was a

day off to go fishing in the river, or
an afternoon downtown trying to get
into X-rated movies.

But woe to the kiddy who dared to
cut school too many times.
Everyone knew what gruesome fate
awaited him. That’s right. He was
nabbed by that maniacal creature-
the truant officer——and never heard

T from again.

Who are these mysterious people
who stalk down truant children and
drag them back to their books? Who

. are these champions of justice who

keep mischievious little bratsin
school where they can't aggravate

1. us and toss baseballs through our
'~ ‘windows? Let's take a trip to a local

school and find out.

"Dr. Strong will be here in a
minute," I was told. What an
appropriate name for a truant-
officer, lthought. Dr. Strong--he
was probably so strong he could
squeeze a little kid's neck until his
head popped off.

And I was going to be riding in the
same car with this wild man? What
if he decided to use my neck for

fpractice? lt was the only one I had.

An elderly lady walked up to me
and solemnly offered me her hand.
What was going on? Was she
sympathy in
advance? I wanted out.

"Hi. I'm Dr. Strong. Pleased to

meet you.” «

“You mean you’re the truant
officer?'T ‘I choked, my neck
throbbing with joy. “Well I'm very
pleased to meet you."

As we walked to her Cutlass
Supreme, I asked Dr. Strong how a
nice lady like herself got mixed up in
such a nasty profession. Had she
wrestled alligators before being
recruited as a truant officer?

For those of you who will attend
the Jerry Brown breakfast tomor-
row, it-will be interesting to see-
whether the California governor
goes for the donut or the hole.

The last man to enter the
Democratic race against Carter and
the last one to give up pursuit,
Brown is most famous for his.
Zen-inspired austerity. _ '

It was his politics of “lowered
expectations” that thrust him into
the national limelight last May,
fresh and curiously styled politics
that centered around a 38-year-old
governor who works a 15-hour day,
leaves vacant a new eight-bedroom,
six-bathroom governor’s mansion
built by his predecessor, drives
around the capital in a motor pool
"Plymouth instead of the govemor’s
Cadillac and sleeps on a simple
mattress (no bed) in an apartment
across from the capital building.

Such spartan frugality pushed
Brown into the Gallup poll at a
‘formidable nine per cent barely a
fortnight after he announced his run
for the presidency. The single-digit

 ’..percentage didn’t reveal half his

were a motley bunch. Most of them
wcre_.,ex-Civil War generals with
thick beards and an unquenchable
thirst for blood (if there was no
Confederate blood around, a little
boy's would do).

But today the profession is a
respectable one. They are called
“social workers" these days, not
truant 0’_fﬁCerS.~ And they were
well—educated men and women, not
a crew of half-crazed headhunters.

Shucks. lhad been hoping to see
at least a little bit of blood.

Uur’ first mission was to track
down a ninth-grader who had
skipped more school than Pitt
students skip football games. Dr.
Strong called the student from a pay
phone booth and told her we’d be
there in a few minutes to have a
little chat about missing school.

“Wait a minute," I pouted to
myself. "1 thought the whole idea
was to sneak up on the unsuspecting

them in advance is no fun.” Isulked
all the way to the girl's house.-

Dr. Strong cruised through the
back alley to find a parking space.

- Just then a pretty little girl scooted

out the back door of the house and
shot up the alley’. Strong was right
behind her.

“Lori ?"

"Yes."

“(jet into the car."

Aha. The little tramp had tried to

pull a fast one on us--the old “out

the back door" trick. But,
naturally, we were too sly for her. It
looked like this might be fun after
all. A

We escorted Lori back to her
home where Dr. Strong had a quick
talk with her mother. The school
would have to file suit in
Alderman‘s court, she explained, if
Lori continued to play hookey.

The distraught mother agreed to V.

bring Lori back with us to the school
to try to. settle the problem. The
three of us stepped out to_ Dr.
Strong's car and waited for Lori to
get her coat.

venturing out of his home state to
test the political waters at a time
when it looked like he and all other
comers might be barred from the
beach.

He knocked some of the wind out
of the Georgia peanut farmer with a
49% -37% surprise) in conservative.-
voting Maryland. He took Nevada
and Rhode Island, then came it
second behind favorite son Frank
Church in Idaho. ___

Brown teamed up with Hum-
phrey in New Jersey to embarrass

Carter with a defeat at the hands of ’

“uncommitted,” while at the other
end of the country the phenomenal
California governor was oblitera-
ting the front-runner in the former’s
home state with a roll-up percen-
tage of 59-21.

But by then it was too late. Brown -

ran out of primaries to beat Carter
with, and the rest is history.

But even then the ambitious
candidate (whose campaign ran a
mere seven weeks, by the way) was
attempting a behind-the-scenes
maneuver to topple Carter at the
convention. Humphrey said
nothing doin’, and so Pitt is having
breakfast with Brown over kind
words for Carter, rather than the
other way around.

It's the kind of 11th-hour power
plays that Brown wanted to pull at
the convention that has‘ made
variouspoliticians skeptical of the

. young governor.  I _ A ._ 'h

no goals. They will evolve as I "go
along.”

Brown was charged time and
again with having no programs on
which to base a run for the White
House. According to New Times
interviewer Robert Scheer (who also
did the famous Carter Playboy
interview), “Brown managed to
match and at times far surpass
Carter's reputation for evasive-
ness.” _

Brown himself has mentioned
more than once that in politics “a
little vagueness goes a long way.”

Along with charges of no plans or
policies, critics often try to hang
Brown with breaking’ down the size
of big government but doing
nothing to cut the scale of big
business.

But Califomia’s most popular.
governor (84% approval), notbeing

- one to beat around the bush with

false modesty, has claimed on
occasion, ‘ ‘I have the best record of
achievements in this country,’-’ and
“If you look at the field, it makes as
much sense for me to be President
as anyone else.” ‘
Since taking office two years ago,
Brown has pushed through manda-

‘ tory prison sentences for the sale of

heroin and heavier sentences for
crimes committed with guns. He’s
slowed California's freeway pro-

' gram by cutting the number of jobs

inth at area and provided unemploy-

ment insurance to farm workers and:
, collective_ bargaining to "teachers. .

And we waited...for over 10

- minutes. We could have waited for

' lU hours. Lori had split out the back
door.

1 was furious. The nerve of the

; young hussy. She thought she could
outsmart us. Well, we'd catch her.
And 1 would personally shake some
sense into that little...

“Please try to bring Lori into

. school tomorrow,” Dr. Strong said
to the mother. "‘We want to do
everything we can to avoid court
action.”

Unbelievable. Dr. Strong was
just letting the little smart-aleck get
away with it. She should have the
girl thrown in jail and see if she
could sneak out of there.

There was only one consolation.
The next girl we were going after
was Lori's best friend, Sandy. They
cut school together and probably
roamed the streets all day and
smoked cigarettes. This one wasn’t
going to give .us the slip.

We drove to Sandy’s house,
which was set back in a wooded area
with beer cans. Dr. Strong rapped
loudly on the door.

A young, blond-haired girl
peeked her head out and then
opened the door. It was the culprit,
all right. She was smoking a
cigarette, just as I had predicted.

“We’d like to talk to you, Sandy.
You’ve been missing far too much
school.”

The girl let us in. Dr. Strong
explained to Sandy that the school
was going to have to take her to
court. The girl cleared some dirty
dishes off ‘the kitchen table,
ignoring us. ,

“Don't take this‘ treatment, Dr.
Strong” I muttered, half aloud.
“Give the little brat a thrashing and

-_ drag her back to school.”

There was a knock on the door. ‘I
opened it. Holy Tamoly. It was
Lori. She walked in, as if we weren't
there, and helped Sandy with the
dishes. '

“Now’s our chance, Dr. Strong,”

continues to grow and there have
been no new taxes.

Today, when Brown ﬂaunts his
record as governor, he has his
immense populatiry to back it up.

He’s the biggest thing on college
campuses since Robert Kennedy,
reading Camus and Hesse, drop-
ping Zen riddles wherever he goes,
maintaining a reputation for
mingling with his constituents
incognito and causing heartstruck
coeds to swoon as the brothers from
Massachusetts did in the last
decade.

But whether that’_s enough to
make him Presidentin 1980 or 1984
is yet to be seen. If you ask Brown,
you can be sure he’ll say it is.

But Dr. Strong did nothing of the
sort. She calmly finished lecturing

the girls about playing hookey, P

asked them to come to school the
following day with their mothers,

was very disappointed.

“I can’t understand it, Dr.
Strong,” I complained, as we
walked back to her car. “Those

And one ofthem made fools of us by
sneaking away. But all you did was

“Ifyou were in my shoes you'd do
the same thing,” Dr. Strong said

quietly. “Sandy’s mother has
cancer. She’s in and out of the
hospital. True, those girls aren’t
saints. But they do miss a lot of

school cleaning up the house for
Sandy’s mother. Can you blame
them?”
I really couldn't.

_like me, nothing seemed like more

fun to him than thrashing a kiddy for

Luckily, there aren’t truant

problems solved. They don’t need
to see his blood.

AMERICAN NOVELIST WINS
NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE

STOCKHOLM Sweden (AP) -
Novelist Saul Bellow won the Nobel
Prize for Literature yesterday for
his books portraying modern man

as frightened and alienated but still‘

striving “to find a foothold in a
tottering world.”

He was the seventh American to
win the coveted award and
completed an unprecedented
sweep of the 1976 prizes by the
United States.

Bellow, 61, had been prominent-
ly mentioned as a possible winner
last year but the 1975 prize went to
Italian poet Eugenio Montale.

Bellow, known for caustic com-
ment about writers’ awards,
continued in the same vein, telling
reporters at. a Chicago news
conference: “The child in me is
delighted. The adult is skeptica .”

He said the Nobel prize given his
friend John Steinbeck in" 1962
“made him wretched.’ I hope it
isn't going to make me wretched.”

Bellow is due in Stockholm Dec.
10 to collect his $160,000 prize
money from Swedish King Karl
XVI Gustaf. ,

Vegetarian Meal Unique But Not

BY PETE BUTCH

The Cornucopia, located in the
300 block of Atwood Street,'h’as a
totally vegetarian menu. But one
isn’t served a plateful of carrots and
celery—the food omnivores imag-
ine vegetarians subsist on. Instead
a variety is offered that is unique
without being exotic.

The place has an atmosphere of
its own, not the kind mass produced
by those restaurant chains. Our
group stepped out of a cold rainy
Oakland night into a bright warm
dining room with a sunnily paneled
decor.

The furniture and linen napkins
give the place an entirely profess-
ional appearance. So does the help.
Our waitress was very courteous
and helpful. She knew the
ingredients of all the unique entrees
like the back of her hand.

Our party sampled the appetiz-
ers. The pumpkin soup was good,

' as was the mizo soup, a bean sprout
concoction whose broth ‘is made

from fermented soybean paste. But
the best dish was the mushroom
caps stuffed with brown rice,
scallions and other vegetables and
spices. _

Various salads also were tried.
They contained delightfully fresh
vegetables and fruits.

The entrees were the most
interesting. Vegetables over whole

EATING TOBACCO HAZARDOUS _

TO YOUR HEALTH

HUME, Mo. (AP)——SchooI
officials here have had a lot of
problems since two high school
students became sick after being
forced to eat tobacco, but they say
they’ve had fewer violations of the

‘no-tobacco regulations.

The controversy started after
three students were caught carrying
cigarettes in their pockets. The
principal gave them the usual
choice of punishments——submit to a
paddling or eat the- offending
tobacco.

Terry Weatherman, 15, and Bill
Adkins, 14, ate the tobacco from 18
cigarettes.

Kenneth Hightower, principal at
Hume High School in this
community of 350 about -68 miles
south of Kansas City, says students
usually opt for two swats from .a
wooden paddle. 2

Terry and Bill began to vomit
after eating the tobacco. Mrs.
William Adkins took her son to a
doctor when he began spitting up
blood.

HEINZ-GREEN SPENDING HALF
MILLION ON ADVERTISING
PHILADELPHIA .(AP)—The
two candidates running for Hugh
Scott’s U.S. Senate seat‘ will spend
close to a half million dollars on
media advertising between now and
the Nov. 2 election.
~That’s $1,600 an hour, $38,000 a

day, a lot of money any way you cut '

it. Throw in ad production costs and
it's a lot more’. '

Fact is, the two candidates,
Republican H..John Heinz III of
Pittsburgh and Democrat William
J. Green of Philadelphia, know
they’re in a real horse race. They
also know radio. and television

ﬁve million voters? in the waning
days will have a big say in who wins.

“Today, you can win almost any
statewide election with the right
media campaign,” says David

who was hired by millionaire Heinz
for the general election. A New

Yorker, Garth has honed the

seaweed does not taste like

very tender. Combined with brown

had two pots of imported coffee,

For dessert we passed up the

The trick to eating in a vegetarian
restaurant is to order plenty. Unlike
eating meat and pototoes, the
entree is just not enough. Ordering
an appetizer, salad, side vegetable
and dessert is a must, if you don’t
want to leave hungry.

considering we did not buy meat or '
alcohol. The tab nickeled and
dimed its way up as we ordered
course after course. The most
extravagant was the coffee, which
was over a dollar for a pot that
contained three cups.

The only other complaint we had
was that the food was rather bland
and without much spice. Granted,
one must be frugal with spices in
order to not overwhelm the light
taste of the vegetables. But they
didn’t have to be inordinately
careful.

All in all, the Cornucopia is an
excellent place to go for that

relegate one’s evaluation of his two
hours on stage to a mere concert
review would be a disgrace.

But for those who must have the
box score—and there’s certainly
nothing wrongin knowing what the
heck the guy played—one could
start by saying there's not much he
misssed.

Going from the soft acoustics of
“Momingside” and “Play Me” to
handclappers . such as “Sweet
Caroline” and .“Cracklin’ Rosie,”
Diamond jolted the crowd to its feet
several times to sing along, dance
along or just register ecstatic
approval.

He served up a couple of
well-worked five-song album
suites. The ﬁrst one, from his most
recent LP, Beautiful Noise, traced
some of the singer-composer’s
earlier struggles on Tin Pan Alley.
The second set recounted the
hopeful story of Jonathan Living-
ston Seagull, just the sort of
rags-to-riches theme Diamond
would write a soundtrack for.

He chose to wrap the night up
with the bird story, himself a
sparkling white blaze in the
converging spotlights, lending a
religious pall to the stage as
Diamond stretched his arms in a
cross. . I
‘‘I Am I Said," however, was the
climax of the concert, and not a
breath was drawn as Diamond sang
the melancholy ﬁrst verses.

What with sequels, old movies
resurfacing and plays expanded for
the big screen, there is not really a
lot happening at movie theaters
these days. '

In that last category is The Ritz, a
very funny movie that still shows its
stage origins. It’s basically geared
for a certain sector of the New York
audience, and, to say the least, its
appeal is quite limited. One cannot
imagine this movie making it out in
Monroe_ville——or the Midwest, the
South and a lot of other places.

, The plot concerns a Cleveland

man (Jack Weston) seeking sanc- .

tuary from his murderous brother-
in-law (Jerry Stiller), who is a part of
a rather large business organiza-
tion.
New York, asks the cab driver to
take him some place unlikely, and
ends up at what he thinks is a health
spa/hotel, but which the less naive
of us spot as “the baths.” ‘ .

The story gets very_ hard to
explain after that, but includes
various members of the gay
community at their draggiest, hired
killers at their nastiest, and
assorted characters at their funni-
est, adding some great non
sequiturs to the nonsense. Chief
among these is the Ritz’s very tacky
featured performer (superbly over-
played by Rita Moreno) who
managed to get herself ﬁred from
just about every big show on
Broadway in the ‘ﬁrst day of
rehearsal.

Conflicts Plague New Album

‘BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

High and Mighty - Uriah Heep
Bronze-BS 2949

Britain's Uriah Heep has been
plagued by internal band conflicts,

poor record sales and personal 3 -

misfortune for the last three years.

And with the recent firing of lead 

vocalist David Byron, more of the
same is likely.

Bursting upon the American
scene back in 1970, Uriah Heep was
one of the pioneers of the British
heavy metal invasion. Look At

Yourself, Demons and Wizards,»

and The Magician’s Birthday, were

' ﬁlled with heave progressive music,

beautiful melody lines and mystical
lyrics.

1973's Sweet ﬁeedom was the
ﬁrst sign of Uriah Heep’s deterior-
ation. The music was becoming
cliched while the song content
bordered on obscure visions of
doom and ridiculous rock n’ .roll
situations.

Bassist Gary Thain was nearly‘

electrocuted on stage in Dallas in
1974 and ultimately quit the band
after their grueling world tour. (He
recently died in England of an
unknown cause.) John Wetton,
formerly of Family, King Crimson
and Roxy Music, was brought in to
replace Thain.

With the release of Return To

Fantasy in 1975, the band publicly‘

exhibited a , rekindling of much
needed spirit and purpose. -It didn’t
last long. The record bombed,

crowds‘ startafls ts ,.dWi!3d1s;an¥‘» thag.

—b%!1adSthit-Paroxidsranstirist

 

band was just hanging on by rote.
The last Heep offering, High and
Mighty, proﬁles 5 band that has

reached the pits. Being a heavy
metal band, the music must exude
energy in order to provide punch for
the listener. High and Mighty just
sits on the turn table and plods.
Ken Hensley seems mostly at

fault. -His virtual dominance.of~ the -
songwriting chores on nine of the’

eleven tunes is a complete mistake.

 

.1

His trademark, shotgun organ‘

rifﬁng and weird lyrical intricacies,
make sense only if you are sniffing
aspirin and bouncing off of the
ceiling. ‘

The many talents of lead guitarist
Mick Box are successfully employed
on only two tunes, “One Way Or

Love.” The rest of the time he is
buried in the background by
Hensley and Byron's sickly vocals.

“Weep in S_ilence,”. “Misty

_,Eyes," “Midnight? and‘ “Foot-

prints inthe Snowf’ are lumbeﬁng

_Another” and “Make A Little‘ K

for insomnia. Uriah Heep is not a
virtuoso band such as Yes, and
these half-assed attempts at
atmospheric pieces are just -soupy
electric mish-mash.

In the recording of heavy metal
music, bands deal primarily with
layers of sound. A simple rhythm
brace is all that is needed if guitars,
vocals and keyboards deliver the
goods. Wetton and drummer Lee
Kerslake do a credible job, but
Hensley, Byron and Box don’t even
come close. '

I suppose Uriah Heep will ﬁnd a
new vocalist to replace Byron , crank
‘out oldies in concert and try to make
enought money‘ to. ‘keep up the

‘payments R on band members’)

estates. Save your money and pick I

up Zeppelin’s new live album if you
want to hearthe real thing.

whose capacity for‘ chutzpah makes
the hotel ’s reigning queens look like

To be sure, The Ritz is hardly as

For Something Completely‘ Differ-
ent, an old movie ﬁnally returned to
Pittsburgh after the success of
Monty Python’s Flying Circus on
local TV. Like that show, this movie
is several years old. Basically, it's
just the same skits seen on
television, but newly shot and
slightlydrevised (there are things
you can’t do even on British
television). . " .

For those of you who are

completely lost, Monty Python is a -

group of five English writer/ actors
and one American writer/ artist,
who had a very successful BBC-TV
show_ a few years back, several
books and record albums, and (most
recently) a stint on Broadway, all‘

based on the TV skits. Last year

their second ﬁlm, Monty Python

the Holy Grail, any original
version of-the King Arthur legend, .-

received some success and genera-
ted new interest for their ﬁrst ﬁlm

(not quite such“ a success on its ﬁrst .
' American release)‘: - .

There could be, more than one
reason for its unenthusiastic
response its ﬁrst time around, and
it's not because of the quality of the
writing. The sketches are just as
insane (or inane, depending on your
point of view) as those seen on TV,
but the general quality of produc-
tion shows up too much as the low
budget show it always has been.
On the small screen, grossly
overdone makeup and obvious wigs
don’t show up, but blown up they
look absolutely ghastly. The color is
quite garish, making one wonder

“Brother Love's Traveling Salva-

encore (there was one more), and
Diamond depicted the famed
faith-healer, this time under a tent
of retractable steel, imploring his
brethren again with extended
arms.

The faithful were thrilled to the
point of inspiration. They wanted
to believe it wasn't just a song, the
Neil Diamond wasn’t just a singer
up there. .

Can a man whose songs rise so
close to heaven be all that mortal?
Do we dare call it music?

Also, the direction is erratic,
sometimes getting downright intru-
sive into the ﬂow of comedy and
spoiling some of the best scenes.

But, fear not, Monty Python fans,
there's still quite a lot to laugh at.
The “classic” sketches are all here,
including “Nudge, Nudge,” “The
Lumberjack Song" and, of course,
“The Dead Parrot.” True to the
title, many of the show’s introduc-
tions of “and now...” make their
way into the ﬁlm, including John
Cleese in a two-piece bikini, and
Terry Gilliam’s bizarre animations

continue to be a high point of the

show.

This year seems to be remarkable
for its lack of originality (the two
biggest ﬁlms to open at Christmas
are remakes). Two recent ﬁlms are
simply sequels to earlier, respect-
ably successful ﬁlms, and, as
sequels go, they're not half bad.

Probably the more popular is
Sounder, Part II (catchy title, huh?),
obviously the sequel to Sounder, a
black family movie of a few years

-back that garnered quite a bit of

notice.

Jack
Weston in Richard Lester’s new
comedy, The Ritz.

Rita Moreno surprises

sharecroppers in the 1930s, but the
heavy drama this time is in trying to
get a school built for the kids of the
uneducated, largely illiterate black
farmers. It’s a tail of tears and
travail, but justice triumphs and
everybody’s happy. It’s a quite
pleasant movie, neither sappy nor

' overwrought, and perfect for even
' the most squeamish member of the

family.

One movie certainly not for the
squeamish is Return of a Man
Called Horse (sequel to A Man
Called Horse—a tough one to
ﬁgure). It's worth seeing even if
you didn't catch the original and
you're interested in a realisticview
of the Indians’ side of the American
West.

The story concerns (obviously
enough) the return of Horse, the
Indian name given to a white
captive (Richard Harris) who was

eventually adopted by the tribe (see _

the last movie for that action). Well,
after the tribe is driven off its
sacred land, Harris comes back to
eventually lead them to new
triumph, trying to use some of his
educated ways and still working on
the old Indian ways. The scenes of
the Indians’ ritual of suffering for
puriﬁcstion is authentic enough,
but not for the weak-hearted.

It’s a good non-exploitative
movie, a not seen enough genre.

Responsible for such songs as

Olias of Sunhillow, Jon Anderson.
Atlantic Records, SD 18180.

Well this is the last of the Yes
solo albums and was expected to be
a musical piece de resistance. To
think otherwise would be heresy,
considering Jon Anderson’s sing-
ing, playing and composing ta-
Ients.

But what was obviously begun as
an ambitious musical venture has

and overlaying of tracks and 10%
playing of them.

There are several ﬁne moments,
though, and the Yes leader
deserves some, but not much,
credit.

“Meeting (Garden of Geda)" is
exotically seductive, with track
upon track of Anderson vocals
whispering indistinct, somewhat
antediluvian syllables. The main
synthesizer whirrs around his
voice, while the drums sound
distant, creating the illusion of

can’t even imitate the group’s
fullness, despite his studio over-

On the other hand, a cut like
“Moon Ra” is hypotic enough to
make one forget its obvious
shortcomings, like shrill vocals and
muddy instrumentation.

It’s the transitional ﬁller on this
album that kills it. You hear the

PELETTER  

We, the undersigned, endorse Jimmy Carter for President and urge members  
of the University community to cast their votes for the Carter-Mondale ticket on November 2.
We are disturbed by the widespread apathyamong our friends in this election campaign and feel we
need to define the sharp differences we see betweenthe two presidential candidates.

Let us remind you briefly of a few things Ford has done in recent years: I

—— He has opposed virtually every piece of progressive social legislation considered by Congress since he arrived in
Washington 27 years ago.

. .  fl   I   I

—— He led the fight to confirm Nixon's notorious Supreme Court nominees G. Harrold Carsell and Clement
Haynesworth and led an abortive effort to impeach Supreme Court Justice William 0. Douglas.

— He said (in Muncieflndianal two weeks to the day before Nixon resigned the Presidency: "l have read the
transcripts. I have watched the impeachment proceedings. And I tell you from thebottom of my heart that
the President of the United States is innocent.” Then," within one month of taking office, he pardoned Richard
Nixon of all crimes committed while he (Nixon)‘ was President. ‘

— He picked Bob Dole, the principal Senatorial defender of Richard Nixon, as his choice for Vice-President of
the United States. ‘ ' ~

— He adopted an amnesty program for Viet Nam war resisters so meanly conceived and narrowly designed that
fewer than five percent of those eligible chose to participate. _ ‘ ' -

The alternative is Jimmy Carter:

— Carter's record asva man of compassion and integrity is confirmed by the black leaders of Georgia. Congress-
man Andrew Young of Atlanta tells us that Carter is a man to be trusted.

—- Carter's record as Governor of Georgia promises that government need not operate in a miasma of indiffer-
ence, arrogance and disarray; it can be efficient and responsive.

— Carter will bring to th_e Presidency a fresh point of view‘ and a creativeivitality uninhibited by long-standing
commitments to special interests. His varied experience as an engineer, businessman, farmer and Governor has
brought him into working relationships with a wide variety of Americans.

' — Carter stands firmly with the conservationists, believes in national health care, and stresses that-all Americans
should be able to find jobs, with government help when the private sector fails.

- Carter has chosen a Vice President, Walter Mondale, whois held in the highest esteem by his colleagues and
who has authored and worked for much of the social legislation of the last 15 years.

A — Carter's foreign policy, in contrast with Ford's, would be more sensitive to third world views, would seriously
. ~- question American assistance to" those regimes that abuse their citizens, and would initiate more effective steps
to reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation. Carter ‘asserts ‘that America should become the breadbasket

. ratherthan the arms merchant. of the world... _. . « .. V. ' . -- ‘ .

Jimmy Carter has said: “In every person there is a widerange of motivation. We feel fear, doubt, insecurity and prej-
udice on the one hand, and courage, hope, compassion and confidence on the other. A President can emphasize either of these groups‘ «
of characteristics, by expressing either the lowest common denominator or by demanding and inspiring the highest possible standards
among our people.” I 5 it ~ «-

We bele_ive Carter will inspire the highest standards. He is by.far the better choice.

We urge you to cast your vote for\Jimmy Carter on November 2.

    Panthers Remember Navy Torpedo

 

BY STEVE SYBERT _
Sports Editor

«ANNAPOLIS, Md.--When a
team is undefeated, second-ranked
and favored by 20 points in some
betting circles, there’s no need to
worry. Right?
opponent is Navy, whom Pitt will
face here tomorrow at Navy-Marine
Corps Stadium, a team which has
given Pitt nothing but trouble over
the past few years.

“The closer we get to the
game,” said Pitt coach Johnny
Majors, “the more our football
team better remember that the
Navy football team will never give
up and will never quit and will
always play up to their abilities like
any of the great teams in the
country.”

Though the Middies stand at 1-5,
with a win over Connecticut and
losses to Rutgers, Michigan (70-
14), Boston College, Air Force and
William and Mary, Majors is still a
bit wary over the team that
engineered an upset at Pitt
Stadium last year, 17-0, when the
Panthers went into the game
conﬁdent, cocky and with a 5-1
record, not too different than their

. present‘ 6-0 mark.

“Navy has been a thorn in our
side for three years,” Majors said.
(In 1973, the Panthers edged Navy,
22-17, and had to rally for a 13-11
win a year later-‘.) We were
embarrassed here last season at
Pitt Stadium, when we were’ 5-1

‘~ going into the game and we looked

like the superior team in the early
going when adversity struck us.”

Everything seems to be right on
schedule for the Pitt team. Several
toifgh opponents have been con-
quered. A quarterback dilemma
has been resolved by a senior with
little playing time. And Tony
Dorsett, well, what can you say
about Tony Dorsett that hasn't yet
been" said.

This may be the game T.D.
becomes the nation’s all-time
major college career rushing

, leader by picking up a “mere” 152

yards to break Archie Grifﬁn’s
mark of 5,177 yards and further
implant the _distinction as being the
greatest running back in the‘ history
of college football and perhaps
even its greatest single performer.
“I don't know what’s going to
happen at Navy,” Dorsett said.
“Who knows? lmight get slowed
down. But I might break the record
too. I‘ just want to make sure I do
get the record some time.
“I’d'prefer to break the record at
home,” Dorsett continued. “But,
who said anything about pulling
myself out of this game? No way. I
would never do anything like that. ’ ’
Dorsett’s first concern, of
course, is. the team and what he
must do to help it earn a victory. So
he is not disappointed that he may
not get the chance to break the
record in front of a home crowd.
Still, Dorsett, Majors , and the
Panthers have a lot of respect for
the Midshipmen remembering well
the recent history.‘ _
“We must try to keep being a
poised football team, ” Majors said,
“because Navy is a team, in the
past few years, which has kept us
oft balance andhas caused us to
make bad plays because of playing
so aggressively. The Navy morale
is such that it always looks forward
to a Saturday ballgame.”

Actually, Navy does not have
much to brag about, but under-

never do. Maybe there is no need

to worry. But just in case, do it a .
just a little tn make sure.

  Scots Bruise Pitt, 2-1

BY JIM LEWIS

‘ The Pitt soccer team has so many
injuries after the Edinboro Fighting
Scots kicked--literally--the Panth-
ers, 2-1, in overtime Tuesday, that
Blue Cross reportedly went out of
business.

You see, the referees up at
Edinboro let the game get so out of
hand that the Scots, ﬁre in their
eyes, played very aggressively.

As a result, the injury list had
grown to unbelievable proportions.

Two players (Randy Gyory and
Kim Blasko) didn’_t make Wednes-
day .night’s practice because of
sickness, but the rest (Fred
Dohrmann, Steve Harrison, Marty
Moyer and Mark Nigh) have bumps
and bruises from Tuesday‘s match.

Add to that list already injured
Jedd Zaring and Jerry Tomassetti,

" , and noteven Prudential would risk

giving Pitt a piece of the rock.
Not that the Scots 'maliciously
tried to maim; they just played an
aggressive, physical style, a style
that Pitt (4-4-l) isn’t used to seeing.
“The officials allowed a game to

' be played that was physical,”

coach -Leo Bemis said, “and that

' isn’t the game that we play. We're

not a physical team, but a team that
likes to pass the ball. You can’t
pass the ball if you’re holding onto
your shins.” Z q

‘ In the game, perhaps the poorest
show, of ofﬁciatin’g the Panthers

 
     

       

eluded the hands of goalie Frank
Bucci and the Scots led, 1-0.

Pitt tied the game 17 minutes
later. Senior Tom Murphy scored
his third goal of the season on a
direct kick in front of the net,
beating the Edinboro goalie and

-- defense, which had built a human
wall to prevent a score. The wall

didn’t work and, after regulation ’

play, the game was tied, 1-1.
50 the match went into overtime.
Pitt was bottling up the Scots,
getting shots and scoring oppor-
tunities--until, that is, an Edinboro
breakaway just four minutes into
overtime. A Scot. broke in alone/on
goalie Fred Dohrmann, who
replaced Bucci (ejected from the
game for complaining to a referee)
after regulation play. Dohrmann
made a nice play forcing the
Edinboro forward over to the side
of the net, but the Soot’s shot
passed Dohrmann, bounced
through the legs of anpncoming
 defender and just caughtithe
inside post, rolling into the net.
“The ball had eyes on it,” Bemis
commented.
And so that was the game-—a
rough, tough, physical contest.
“Murphy and Erwin Siegel
played well,” Bemis said after-
wards. “We should have scored
more goals, though. We missed
our opportunities to, score and we
lost.” p ’
“Edinboro .. has a ..good team

know they were so physical. We
would have taken our .metal
shinguards along if we knew that.
We just weren’t up to winning that
one.”

The Panthers will travel to Grove
City tomorrow for a match against
the 16th-ranked Wolverines.

‘-‘We're going to be hurting_

some,” Bemis worried. “Grove
City can score goals and ‘are quite
stingy on defense. They’re a
hustling team and’ a winning team
and are tough to beat at home.”

The Wolverines boast a 7-2-1‘

record and hope ‘to travel to
post-season playoffs this year. A
win against Pitt will enhance those
hopes.
-“We’ll do our. darndest to get

game.” Bemis said determinedly.‘

Reporters Out For Scoops,
lwbisturbing Coach Majors

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

ANNAPOLIS, Md.¥Pitt head football; coach Johnny Majors,
disturbed over comments from reporters earlier in the week, will try to

«direct his mind to the business at hand as the 6-0 Panthers, ranked

second in both the AP and UPI polls, take on the Navy Midshipmen here
tomorrow. « ' ' V

Navy, 1-5, would seem-to be a walkover for the Panthers, hungry for
their first national crown since 1937, but several complications have
cropped up to slice off a bit of that certainty. _

Majors has a bone to pick with the reporters and indeed he has reason
to. An article Thursday had Majors signed, sealed and all but delivered
to the head coaching spot at Tennessee, his alma mater, when actually
there is no job to be ﬁlled at present.

i There have been rumors that troubled‘ Volunteer coach Bill Battle
would be resigning at the end of the season if Tennessee did not turn
around its falling football program, but Battle said the school will have to
fire him and, as of yet, they have not. ‘So there is no vacancy.

Another article, in the same paper and on the same day by the way,.
criticized the Panthers’ schedule, which, if you ever looked deeply into
college football, is made up seven or eight years in advance.

That’s how the,likes of Louisville, Temple and Miami got on the Pitt
schedule. Someone, about seven years ago, looked at the credentials of
these schools and thought they would be, a good matchup for the
Panthers, who, seven years ago, weren’t exactly winning and in the
position to face any other top .caliber teams besides Notre Dame and

‘ Penn State. ,

“A big part of the time, they (the stories) cannot be substantiated,”
Majors said via his taped ‘ ‘hotline” on Wednesday, ‘ ‘and quite often are
not based on integrity of the people writing the article. They're" hoping
to get a scoop (in regards to the Tennessee position) and if something
turns out correclty, they can say I told you so.

“Frankly, it gets disgusting at times,” Majors continued, his voice
modifying his anger. “They canafford to make wild, rash statements
without backing them up.” ‘ V A

One veteran Pittsburgh reporter approached me Wednesday and

‘asked jokingly, Ithought, why I never “badmouthed”, anybody‘. “You

say too many nice things,” he ‘said. “You should be badmouthing
sometime.” I really think he was joking, but now I sort of wonder.
“Badmouthing,” or any kind of criticism, has its time and place. A
story criticizing someone is one of the easiest to write, especially for a
writer who had 20 inches to fill and can’t think of anything constructive.
“When you’re down on the mat, people criticize you for not getting
better,’-’ Majors said. “When you get good, they start finding
something else (like the schedule, for example) to criticize or pick.

Frankly, I've seen very few big top 10 schools that play a killer schedule..

You can look at Michigan, Ohio State, pereni/ally in the top 10, and Notre
Dame, and they’re certainly not playing killer schedules.”

I haven’t badmouthed anyone, until now maybe, and I feel just as
good about writing nice things when they are merited. :But I won’t

hesitate to criticize when some “b_admouthing” is warranted either. A . A

“Redshirt” Pitt Jersey For DiCiccio  

BY KAREN KADILAK

To the Pitt fan with an otherwise
minimal knowledge of football,
“redshirt” is the new monicker for
the Panthers" defense. However,
that's only part of the deﬁnition.

Ask the fan well-versed in
football terminology and technique
and he’ll probably explain that
there's another entirely different
deﬁnition for “redshirt.” More
than likely, he’ll tell you that a
“redshirt” is a status in which the
injured or academically ineligible
college player sits out an entire
season in hopes of getting whatever
ails him straightened out in time‘ for .
when he does come back. I

Then again, ask _ Pitt’s special

- teams standout Dave DiCiccio or the

Panthers’ quarterback Robert Hay-
good what a “medical redshirt” is.
Chances ‘are, you’ll get" another
definition of the word.

Neither DiCiccio nor Haygood
will bore you with the technical
deﬁnitions, as,Joe Fan does, not
will they probably give its meaning
as some new nickname applicable to
the Pitt defense. Four letters will do
in fact. PAIN, plain and simple
PAIN. . 2

Pain, and lots of it, was what
forced sophomore DiCiccio to skip
last season, which was technically
his sophomore season (in losing his
year of eligibility, the redshirt
returns to the same * grade
classiﬁcation the following year),

V, and more recently, was what forced

it

t _; stu;d._ent?,at,._-Pit '

senior quarterback Haygood to the-
sidelines this season. 4,
It is there that all similarities

‘between ‘DiCiccio and Haygood

end. While Haygood’s recovery
remains to be seen, (that is, of
course, if he doesn't skip his ﬁnal

Chapinf--Rewards

BY RON SIEGEL

At one end of spectrum of the
Pitt _football team are the Tony
Dorsetts. At the other end, the
obscure end, are the Jim Chapins.
. Why Tony ‘Dorsett plays college
football is obvious. A free
education, glory, publicity and a
shot at the pros are there for him.
For the vast majority of "the team,
even if pro football does not wait at
the end of the trail, there is that
scholarship. ‘ ‘

For’the non-scholarship player,
the rewards are few. In the back of
his mind‘~is the dream of playing for
the nations. second-ranked team.

  

JIM CHAPIN

That dream came true for Tom
Yewcic two weeks ago. Wile“ he
replaced Matt Cavanaugh 1“ the
Louisville game.

year of eligibility for a shot at the
pros), DiCiccio’s, for all intents and
purposes, is at hand“

The sandy-haired sophomore has
endured the physical pain, although
the muscles in his damaged left
shoulder remind him by their
continuous throbbing that his
recovery is not, and probably never
will be, complete.

‘‘I injured the rotary cuff in my I

shoulder,"e DiCiccio explained,
ﬁngering the injured area. “Sup-
posedly, it has something to do with

. DAVE DICICCIO
keeping the shoulder in the
socket,” he continued, thankfully
avoiding the complex medical terms
in describing the injury. ‘‘I had the,
muscles around the rotary cuff
repaired.”

“There’s also another kind of
pain commonly associated with the
medical redshirt-—mental anguish.
Fortunately for the tightly-muscled
DiCiccio, he won his own version in

the constant struggle of iniiiii over ‘

body.

“I came to Pitt because school is
the 'most important thing‘ for me,
and Pitt had what I originally
wanted ‘to major in—physical
therapy,” said Chapin, a 6-0,
209-pound linebacker who had just
sweated through _a practice session
as much as anystarter.

‘fl ' just .didn’t have enough
football in high school,” he said.
“I talked to coach Majors and
coach Madden and they‘enc"ourag-
ed me to give it a whirl.” If Pitt
hadn’t made a commitment to
‘big-time football, Chapin wouldn't
be caught near Pitt Stadium.

“Hell would freeze over before
I’d have played then,” he said. “I
probably would have come to
school here, but I’d never play
ball." e P

-A senior now, Chapin has been
laboring in obscurity for four
Outside of a few junior
varsity games, he's never played.
He did make the Sun Bowl trip last

iv year, but didn’t get in the game.

Currently listed as a third-string
linebacker, Chapin’s onlychance to
play will come o injuries or when

I‘ Pitt is sitting on a huge lead. With

the quarterback problems Pitt has
suffered, the Panthers are more
worried about winning than about
the margin of victory.

Asked what -he would do if he
had it to do over again, Chapin
reﬂected a while before answering.
“I though maybe I would have
played more,” he said. “This is
how it worked out though, so I have
to accept it. I want to get into
coaching when I graduate, and I
learned a lot about  here.”

“I didn't really like sitting with
the rest of the student body,
watching my teammates play,
knowing that I could be down there
helping out,” DiCiccio added. ‘‘It
was extremely frustrating. ’ ’

Unlike many redshirts, DiCiccio
believed the redshirt was personally j
beneﬁcial.

“I was behind the rest of the guys _
by about a year,” DiCiccio pointed
out “I graduated from high school
when I was 17.. So when I came in
here as afreshmen, most of the
guys were 18, some were even 19. I
was already a year behind them.
age-wise. Now I'm catchingup with
them,” he added.

It also helped in another way. It
made DiCiccio come back that much
stronger, and of course,a year
wiser.

“It made me realize that I had to‘
try that much harder,” DiCiccio
noted. As it turned out, DiCiccio
and his roommates Randy Holloway
and linebacker Gary Tyra worked
out with_weights during the summer
in Tyra’s hometown, Elmira, N.Y.

“I learned some tips while I was
there on how to exercise the
shou1der_,f’ DiCiccio stated.

Ironically, Tyra _ also is I being
redshirted this season with a torn
hamstring. .e

“I really sympathize with those
guys being redshirted-Haygood,
Tyra—I really feel sorry for them, ’_’
DiCiccio commented. . ‘

DiCiccio’s ability to adjust to a
generally dismal situation as well as -
he has can be partly attributed to
past experience. Even as an
All-State quarterback candidate at
Midland High School in Midland
Pa., DiCiccio was never, able to
escape the injury bug. Before

service is never seen by the fans,
but it is a job that has to be done.
When injuries decimate a. posi-
tion, as happened to Pitt with its
quarterbacks, walk-ons add needed
depth, and at times are called on to
play. They'll never get any
recognition unless they do.
‘Anyone who has felt a desire to
be a part, any -part, of Pitt football,
should understand why Jim Chapin
goes through what he does. He? s a
part of a potential national '
champion, and’ if he's called on to
play, he’ll be ready. ‘

senior year, DiCiccio wasconstantly
hampered by muscle pulls and the
"other nagging little hurts that
combine to make one big hurt.

Past experience, or I not, no

_ letdown is evident in eyes of either
head coach Johnny Majors or
assistant head coachJoe Madden.
Both raved about DiCiccio’s special
teams play.

‘ ‘He's invaluable on those special
teams," Majors commented. “He
has that super ability to weed out
the return man and make the
tackle."

“He’s consistently the highest
grader for the special teams’ play,’ ’
Madden pointed out.

‘Both Majors and Madden realize
the value of such an athletic talent
as DiCiccio.

High-Flying Buckeye Power

BY DAVE McDONALD
What ﬂys, has 14 legs and lives

on ﬂat terrain?

The Pitt cross country team
knows and will try to bring this
creature, the Ohio State cross
country squad, down to earth on
Saturday. The Panthers travel to
Ohio State in Columbus to face
Kentucky, Cincinnati and the host
Buckeyes in a six-mile race over a
predominantly ﬁat golf course.

Netters Insulted, 3-2

BY JIM GEFSKY

All Indiana University of Penn-
sylvania did was add insult to
injury.

Tuesday at Trees Courts, the
already battered Pantherette net-
ters lost another key player, Jan
Irwin, to a twisted ankle. IUP

.’ further ‘ ‘insulted’ " Pitt" by ' bruising
the netters 3-2, lowering their

record to 4-2. The defeat was
caused, to a large degree, by
lrwin’s injury.

On the bright side for Pitt, Maria
Paris was in her usual form as she
whipped Sally Bissell, 6-3,6-4; and
Janet DeCostro did. a job (6-0, 6-0)
on Mimi Dibor.

On the dismal side, there was the
lackluster play of the doubles
teams. The teams of Nancy

Lies-Ann Seebold could take only

result was that she had to default,
which helped give IUP the victory.
The long range result is that she
will probably be sidelined indeﬁn-
itely. (Considering only three more
matches remain, she might well be
out for the rest of the season.) Her
replacement still is unknown.
Dane Frey also was injured when
she‘ was hit in the back with a
tennis ball prior to the match. She ’
eventually was forced to view the '
action from the sidelines. A good
note was the return of Ballistreri
after her knee injury last Saturday.

concerned Pitt coach Nancy Gor-
don. “Except for Jan Brownstein,

“We’ll be in the race all the way

“We have to keep close contact and
