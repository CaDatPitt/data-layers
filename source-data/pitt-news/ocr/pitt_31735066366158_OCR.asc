Freshmen Women Live
In Former Grad. Dorm.

Freshman women. are living in Tower C this trimester
due to a change in University policy during the springtenn,
according to Savina S. Skewis, dean of women. This change
was necessitated bythe. large number of upperclass women
who deturned this fall and an unexpected number of trans-'
fer students. ' '

There are 1,460 women living
in the Schenley Quadrangle and
in Tower C this term. A total of
143 nurses and liberal arts up-
perclassmen are being housed in
the Nurses’ Residence, she added.

Problems resulting from the
architecture of Tower C include
the scarce number of telephones
available, the fact that all the
rooms are singles, and the lack
of kitchen facilities.‘A desk was
installed in the lobby to’ handle
the signing out procedure and

Giving a student six extra weeks
to write a paper merely because
he did not bother to meet the
deadline would penalize the other

himself “student oriented”
well as “quality oriented.” He
hopes that “students will come to
see me without fear of any retri-
bution.” In taking a positive ap-
proach to a student -and his prob-
lem, Dr. Mulgrave promises that
students will get a fair hearing
but adds, “I’m not going to make
a decision for one person that
will affect another adversely.”
The attempt to be fair is es-
pecially important in decisions
regarding “G” grades, which in-
dicate that the course require-
ments were not completed. The
“G" grade, which Dr. Mulgrave
describes as “the biggest thorn
in the side of students, instruc-
tors, and myself,” cannot be re-
owed withou ’p¢r!i!i.$S.i.on"

Speaking about possible changes
in the administration of his
duties, Dr. Mulgrave feels that
“the decisions will probably be
about the same but I may han-
dle them a little different. I
hope to be fair and just-which
I feel ‘is one of the requirements
for the job and also compassion-
ate.”

  i 100 Students Attend
Frosh Camp Weekend

if

   

By FRED N. FRANK

VOver 100 freshhien participated
in a campus experience that em-
phasized the discussion of social
problems as well as participation
in athletic events. The new stu-
dents participated in these dis-

cussions at Freshmen Camp held.

at Camp Kon-O-Kwee from Sept.
4-6.

With a three to one ratio be-
tween campers and counselors,
an intimacy of relationship soon
developed between the upper-
fclassmen and freshmen at the
Acamp.This intimacy gave the
camp experience one of its many
“intangible values,” according to
University YMCA executive Frank
Watanabe, who coodinated camp
activitiesl

The main seminar .at the camp
discussed the general topic of so-

cial responsibility. The seminar ~

A ‘discussion leaders, Dr. Richard
Tobias, associate professor "of Eng-

lish, and Dr. Morris Berkowitz,

associate professor of sociology,
presented their views on the role
of the student in society.

Dr. Berkowitz pointed out that
the student should involve him-
self in the “selﬁsh act of self-
improvement and he should make
‘himself available for education
in the world around him.” Citing
the University students who par-
ticipated in Alabama demonstra-
tions, he said they learned “more
about sociology there than they
could in a year in a classroom.”

Dr. Tobias saw many people

leases for .their emotional ener-
gies. He gave the recent Watts
riots in Los Angeles as an ‘ex-

means of communication among
men. He looked to the aitist as
one who could “shape emotions
so we can understand them.”

Both faculty members express-
ed the feeling that the three days
were a worthwhile experience
both for themselves and for the
students attending. Dr. Tobias
found the freshmen to have “an
awful lot of energy” which they
released during camp. He was
also hopeful that the camp ex-
-perience helped the freshmen to
realize that, professors are “hu-
man beings and not someone spe-
cial way up there.”

Dr. Berkowitz felt the essential
value of the camp was that the
boys got to meet someone else
in their class, but he i also saw
removing “the ogre aura” about
professors as an important 860*
ond value. “The camp beneﬁted
mostly from its informality,” he
said, “It had an implicit value
in that a freshmen could see a
professor in shorts on top of the
table shooting the breeze with

But Dr. Berkowitz also saw it
as an excellent self education

S experience. “It was valuable for

all of us—myself, my wife and
my children,” he explained, “col-
lege professors tend to be remote

ly got /to meet them and have

Student Affairs as chairman with the ﬁnancial adviser to Student
Activities as a committee member. E

The passage of the Appropriations Committee bill at the SG
meeting followed the defeat of a bill which would have set up a
committee. which SG would have completely controlled. Proposed by
Senator Richard Shweder, the bill gave no power to the Student Af-

\ fairs Committee, which Shweder called “extra-legal.” SG President

Eric Stern, Shweder, and other supporters of the bill felt that as the
elected body representing the students, SG should assume full author-
ity in the matter of student activity funds.

SG ﬁnally tabled a motion regarding the method of selection of
committee members after the motion had been amended twice. In
its latest form the bill proposed by Senators Janis and Bernstein,

ed by nominations by‘ the president, made after consulting with the
Executive "branch. The bill will be discussed at a future meeting.

    Edithrial: Shape Up or Ship Out  

Student Government (SG) proved last Thursday evening that it has
1;. ‘acquired the maturity to be ‘considered the primary representative of
student’ body. Its members abused, disgraced, and pushed aside stu-
nt responsibility, substituting selﬁshness, greed, and political antics.

    
   
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
   
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
   

Each group violently opposed the other’s recommendations, giving
no leeway for bipartisan efforts. The meeting became stagnated with
lengthy motions, amendments, and parliamentary -entanglements. Vice-
President Jerry Hogan, the presiding officer, spent most of his time clari- ‘
fying parliamentary rules and asking for order.

 Senators haggled, debated, and philosophized for nearly three hours
“at the Student Appropriations Committee. T-he net result was a motion I
changing the composition of the Appropriations Committee and
ii‘-ther delaying the allocation of the student activities fee;

The personal conduct was abominable. Senator Rick Shweder, SG
ent Eric Stern, and several observers  the gallery made a mockery
he meeting. ' _ —

_. },Shweder made several trips from his senate seat in the front of the
ppm to the gallery, conferring with Irv Garﬁnkel, who graduated last
,  some student observers. He asked for no recognition’ from the
,r,__‘and each time disrupted the meeting without apology. —

On three Ioccassions, the personal bickering anddisturbance from P
the gallery became so intense that Senators rose to protest the lack of
respect among Senators and observers. ‘

The activities fee allocation has been a major student goal since
September, 1964. It has been supported by all student organizations, hop- V
ing it would allow expansion of student activities. I -

_ If the Senators were really as concerned about students as they said
in their ‘speeches, they would have dropped their petty political gamescand
sought a quick and reasonable solution. SG will not consider nominations
for at least another week and now must await Vice-Chancellor Helen Rush’s
approval of the new committee composition.

__  -Stern sat smugly at the head table all evening; his most energetic
" ties being three" trips to the back of the room. One time he literally,
:_ out of his. seat, and just missed knocking over several people.

A He, too, disturbed the meeting by talking  the back while ‘business
as” being conducted, asking for no pardon and not once making an apology.

If Stern were concerned with increasing student responsibility as
he has constantly said, he would have sought a bipartisan solution instead
of creating a rift by obvious favoring of one side.

If he is to be a President, he must drop the personal greed and juv-
enile desire for having things only his way. He must compromise,‘ lead,
and work for equitable solutions instead of demanding, planning secretly,-L\
and making unreasonable demands.

, Garfinkel and other observers joined in the ‘inconsiderate conduct,
'ng around the back and making trips in and out the back door.

Besides the personal behavior, political antagonisms permeated the
ting: Two cliques formed: those following the ideas proposed by Stern :
Shweder and those following the proposals of Senators John Ruskay,
la Bernstein, and Jim Janis. ‘

Finally, if Stern persists in closing himself off from the student I
body and not conferring with his entire senate, the responsible Senators
and students must take appropriate action. -

space a week.

The problem of subject re-
mained. Between' the Viet-
nam -situation and the N a-_

tional League pennant race '

there is a lot of excitement
in the world right now. How-
ever, these are transient
problems- The National
League pennant race will be
over within a month, and
the‘ Vietnam situation may
prove to be the world's ﬁnal
transient problem.

I REALIZED that rather
than handle a topic which
may be obsolete by the time
my column reaches print, I

should deal exclusively with

problems that could concern

1 University students for the

length of their college ca-
reers. I intend to answer
such questions as “What is
the psychology behind snow.-
ing freshman girls '2” and-
“Should I interrupt my
schooling with a year’s vaca-
tion ?”

And so, much to the cha-
grin of Fat Howard who had
planned that we would put
on shorts and beanies this
afternoon and enter the an-

.nual Oakland Little League

Marble Tournament, I think
I’ll trot over to The Pitt
News office and see if Bene-
volent Bill Cabin will save
me from the wrath of Chee-
ko Kaplan. '_

Though the ﬁnancial crisis
drew the most attention this
summer, there were other

will bear watching during
the next trimester.

THAT EVENING, stu-

ﬁlled Tower A cafeteria for
five hours of “scholarly de-

professor of history, pre-

both listened and question-

It is doubtful that the
teach-in swayed many _one
way or another, but it 1s_ a

certainty that few left the ,

teach-in without a deeper
knowledge of the situation.

THE FIRST issue of
NOMOS, “.3. new publication
aiming to serve the creative
and intellectual community
at the University and in
Pittsburgh” appeared on
campus the week of June 14.
Printed in blue ink, the four-
page NOMOS featured Dr.
Colodny’s teach - in speech,
and an exploration into poet
Robinson Peffes’s interest in
and use of science in his art.

P u bl i s h e d independently

‘of the University, the'maga-

zine was staffed primarily
by University students, but
since its second issue later
that trimester (highlighted
by poems by Atlantic award
winner, Ed Roberson, and
printed this time in brown),
it has attracted contributions
from throughout the Pitts-
burgh community from so-
cial criticism. to philosophi-
cal work. _

The summer is over but
political crises are still with
us and NOMOS is due to
publish its 3rd issue shortly.

University enrollment is at M

least twice as large as that
during the spring trimester.
Will the concern for intellec-
tual pursuits outside the
classroom disappear with the

summer or double with the\«_

 _jNTED: MORE SOLDIERS FOR THE BATTLEFIELD

* By the looks of the number of -recruits this year for the
fr shmen football squad it seems lilgethe University of Sai-
on‘ has more to offer than the University of Pittsburgh.
 sixteen candidates passed the psysical and mental
"ts to be accepted foffootball scholarships. ’

After having good fortune recruiting freshmen last

rvthe roof fell in on the coaches and athletic department.
-9-1 season in 1963 helped the Panthers ﬁll their quota
25 football scholarships to incominglfreshmen. For two
ears-before that, lousy squads were brought in and this is
S of the reasons the Panthers are not picked as pre—season-
‘owerhouses. _ -
,. ‘‘We really took a beating _this year in recruiting,” said
thletic Director Frank Carver, “if we don’t do Well this
ar. I can’t possibly see how we can win or compete in the
time football that Pitt football-rooters are used to.”

‘Although Carver and the coaching staff are upset about
the ‘predicament football is in at the university no one is
ushing the panic button. Carver is conﬁdent that next
"fear will be asbetter recruitingyear and anyway the team’s
chedule is already booked through 1974, therefore, big

me football will at least be around till then, at least if
_he University is here. a .
' Many criticisms are thrown at Carver and the athletic
qepartment, however, isolating one and saying that it is
j-he, major factor in Pitt's problems is not being realistic.
Without knowing the facts,-it is easy to say that '-the Uni-
sity doesn’t branch outenough when recruiting, or that
 ,_doesn’t get its share of the Western Pennsylvania
 nt or possibly that the coaches‘ don’t do an adequate job

.l1i__ng the school to the prospective athletes. ,

 Before we can even consider any of these elements, limi-
- ions were put on the athletic department from the begin-
g‘.Through contacts with high school coaches and scouts,
.0,h0Ys names were submitted to the athletic department

consideration as applicants to Pitt. The number who
qualiﬁed totaled only 40. E. " ,

The question is then where did all the flowers go? Six-
een from forty leaves twenty-four and they are as widely
cattered as Penn State, Ohio State, Kent State, VPI,.and
he Ivy and -big Eastern schools. These schools don’t have
sier requirements than Pitt, but seemed more attractive
o’ the potential applicants. - ‘
.57 ' S It is also difficult for the athletic department to hear V
of a boy playing in a faraway high school in a far away
State, especially if Pitt has a bad football season. When the r
gridders were second in the country in 1963 they got boys
om California, Arizona, and Missouri to come, mainly be-
ause of the publicity the school received. ,

W  A frequently used quote concerning recruiting in this‘
éiiarea is “with all the material in this area Pitt should be the
umber one team in the country.” Whatis forgotten that
' uch of the talent in this areais not academically qualified
d ﬁnds a haven in the not so academically rugged South-
west Conference.  - .

* Another reason that Pitt didn’t get its share of foot-
"all players from this area, is just simply that Penn State
beat the‘ hell out of them in the big scramble this year. The
-'-ions‘ grabbed more than their share according to Carver.
.“I don’t thinkour coaches can be blamed for a poor
telling job either,” said.Carver. “Bimbo -did some research
wjork and he interviewed approximately ﬁfty players on the
Pitt football team and only four or ﬁve had Pitt as their '
first choice when they were deciding. Only 25 had Pitt in
he top three choices.” ~
‘ g This means that the coaches did an adequate job in the
past. selling the school to boys who had very little intention

‘_ , coming here. The attractiveness "of the University in the
physical plant and in the curriculum are deﬁnite assets to
Lcoach trying to get a signature on a letter of intent.

The school’s financial pro‘blems,‘the poor season, the bad
publicity, and the exaggerated high academic standards also
scared boys away. Possibly what the athletic department
eeds is an experienced fraternity man who is adept in the

Grid Coaches Face Difficult Tasks

Replacing Experienced Lettermen

By TOM SACKS
Replacing graduating seniors has always
provided headaches for college coaches, but
this year the football staff has been given
a compound migrain due to the loss of stars
Marty Shoftenheimer, Ray Popp and Fred

» Mazurek.

“Shottenheimer and Popp were two of the best
defensive players that ever came to this school,”
said defensive backﬁeld coach Carl DePasqua.

Shottenheimer’s graduation left a big hole in
the middle lineb-acking spot. The task of ﬁlling
this gap went to sophomore Tom Mitrakos. “The
middle linebacker can't afford to make any mis-
takes,” said coach John Michelosen. “He’s the key
to the defense.” _

Michelosen, who has been beeﬁng up the de-
fense, admits that “a lot rides on Mitrakos. He’s
replacing one of the best, but he has the potential.”

“Of course, ﬁlling in for Shottenheimer is
tough,” said quarterback coach Bimbo Cecconi.

“With Mitrakos we know we have the body, .but A

it's the experience that’s needed. We’re lucky we
have two good veterans on either side of him.”
The two veterans are Josh Novogratz and Jim
Flanigan. Novogratz has been converted to the
corner linebacking spot after playing offensive

gilard for two years. Flanigan is already being ,

tabbed as another Joe Schmidt, the Panther All-
A;nerica. in 1952. .

“Flanigan has the sense to smell a play,” said
Michelosen. “It is a quality that some players
have without any coaching.”

 Another sophomore, Dave Drake, is being
groomed to replace Popp at middle guard. Experi-
ence will be the main deficit there. Mazu_rek’s
absence will not be quite as obvious as the other
two due to quarterback Kenny Lucas" two years
as understudy,

Shottenheimer,‘ Popp and Mazurek all entered
the pro ranks at the beginning of this year. Popp
and Mazurek both made quick exits, but Schotten-
heimer is’ apparently secure with Buffalo of the
American Football League.

Popp was released in the ﬁrst cut by the New
York Giants. “Popp had all the moves for the
inside, but he didn’t have the range the Giants
expected,” said DePasqua. “They didn’t even give
him a chance to show what he did have

Mazurek has been placed on the taxi squad
of the Washington Redskins. He was originally
brought there to back up all-pro ﬂanker Bobby
Mitchell. The Redskins soon moved him into the
defensive backﬁeld, but still unsatisﬁed, they
placed him on the reserve squad. “Apparently
they think he has some potential or he wouldn't
even be on the taxi squad,” said DePasqua.

Other former gridders have also been having a

tough time among the pros recently. Bill Bodle,

halfback last year, was cut by the Redskins. Last
Wednesday, Kansas City of the American League
released 1963 All-American"Ernie Borghetti.

“Shottenheimer won't be seeing that much ac- 
tion this year, either,” said DePasqua. “It takes a

long_ time to learn the tricks of pro football. I
can only remember one rookie who ever started
right in and -thatwas Joe Schmidt.”

By GEORGE LIES
Aldo Zortea was born in
Germany when people would
“watch soccer to keep their
minds off of the second World
War.

In Germany, soccer is the
sport. And as a matter of fact,
it is better regulated than our
Great ‘National Pastime, baseball.

“Ove_14 there youngsters play

soccer in age groups just‘ as boys,

play Little League,‘and Colt
League baseball here,” said "Zor-
‘tea. “Only its better organized.”
.,Each professional German team
has its own farm teams. These
teams are managed by profes-
"sional coaches who develop play-

‘-‘ 1"“-'-rui.-,a~ .. .  -

\"ers for the mother club. “Instead

of worrying about a large group
C of boys, the coach just has one
>7 team of 11 players,” said Zortea.
A Just as a player progresses in
.Minor League baseball, these soc-
cer players must also climb‘the
ladder to reach the‘ professional

team. .
“At seven .or eight years of age,
a boy plays in the D group. ‘As
he gains experience, the boy.

"moves through the C, B, and A ' ‘
groups. Finally, he enters the E ‘

Junior class (usually at 16 or
17),” Zortea said. v

Then if a player continues suc-
cessfully, ‘the professional team
calls him up.

“Before my family came here
in 1957, I was in B going into
A,» but I was only three or four
years away from playing- pro
ball,” he said. «

Two of Zortea’s former play-
ing mates made it to the pros.

By combining just 4 panel sizes in satin black
or gleaming brass wrought iron, there's no limit to
‘the number of arrangements you can design to fit
your space and needs. Note that straight panels can
be used horizontally or vertically...and horizontal
panels may be attached at any desired height on the
vertical panels.

longer or deeper simply add more Erecta-Shelf panels’
. . . or change the arrangement completely. It's .a
cinch to disassemble for movingtoo. Plan your unit
