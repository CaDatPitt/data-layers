Bigelow to shut clown in Sept.

Stuclents
interest sway
McDonald's vote

By Anthony Breznican
Senior Stajf Writer

Students and Pitt administrators won the
first step in their quest to shut down Bigelow
Boulevard yesterday.

City Council members met for another
vote on the issue which resulted in a five-to-
four vote in favor of the test closing.

The portion of Bigelow Boulevard
between the William Pitt Union and the
Cathedral of Learning is slated to be shut
down and blocked sometime this September.

Last week, the vote to close was dead-
locked with four members in favor, four
opposed and one abstention.

“Obviously, we’re very pleased with the
City Council’s decision,” said Pitt spokesper-
son Ken Service. “It presents a great opportu-
nity for Pitt and Pitt students.”

Councilman Bob O’Connor had abstained
from voting on the issue and said that he
would vote in favor of the closing if parking
were available on Forbes Avenue during rush
hour and if Pitt would turn the empty Burger

batt e over
benefits

By Jennifer Alpha
Staff Writer

After initiating legal action
against Pitt for violation of a city
ordinance banning discrimination
based on sexual orientation, a legal
writing instructor at the School of
Law has resigned.

Deborah Henson, who filed her
complaint with the Pittsburgh
Human Relations Commission in
January for Pitt’s refusal to extend
health care beneﬁts to her same-sex
partner of nine years, will be leaving
the university April 27, at the end of
the academic tenn.

“My decision is primarily per-
sonal and professional in nature. but
perhaps I would have been happier
here had the university responded
more favorably and promptly to my
complaint,” she said.

Though both same- and opposite-
sex domestic partners are denied
health care benefits. Henson said
same-sex partners receive unequal
treatment. Henson said virtually all
heterosexual employees can obtain
health care benefits for their part-
ners because of Pennsylvania’s
loose laws on common law mar-
riage and Pitt’s lax practicesin
requiring documentation of mar-
riage. Coupled with the fact that
Pennsylvania does not recognize

Tanning salons are not always fun under the sun

his time of year, many Pitt stu-

dents may take up one of the dis-

count offers being promoted by
tanning salons in the area. These stu-
dents may believe that a few visits to
the tanning salon can produce a base
tan for the summer or change the
“unattractive” look of pale skin.

In spite of claims that tanning beds
are “safe taiming,” the light rays from
beds may be up to 10 times stronger
than the noontime summer sunlight.
Artificial radiation carries all the risks
of real sunlight. People who do not
usually tan in the sun will also not tan
under the lights. Many tanning parlors
are unregulated, which allows cus-
tomers access to tanning beds

skin cancer if they tan outside and in
tanning booths than if they only tan in
the sun. UV rays can also cause eye
damage such as conjunctivitis and

cataracts. In addition, UV rays can '

damage the body’s immune system and
how the body reacts to certain fra-
grances, lotions, moisturizers and med-
ications.

Since there are so many negative,

effects associated with tanning beds,
how can you protect yourself against
the harmful UV rays? Using a sun-
screen while tanning with sun lamps
requires longer tanning sessions.
Therefore, sunscreens are not recom-
mended except on sensitive body parts.

Always use the special goggles pro-
vided by the tarming salon. Make sure
they ﬁt snugly around the eyes and are
not cracked. Do not use alternatives
such as sunglasses or cotton balls.
Follow the recommended time expo-
sure for your skin type.

Avoid tanning if your skin burns eas-
ily, you have fair skin. or if you are
using certain photosensitive medica-
tions (if unsure always ask your phar-
macist). Be sure that someone is near-
by to help while you are tar-ning, in
case of an emergency.

If signs of injury occur, such as
severe skin burns, eye burns or allergic
reactions, seek professional medical

assistance. Report serious injuries to
the manufacturer of the tanning bed
and to your FDA district office (under
U.S. Government, Health and Human
Services, Food and Drug
Administration in your phone directo-
ry).

For further information on tanning
beds and skin damage. contact the
UPMC Department of Dermatology at
648-3263 or the University of
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Information
and Referral Service at 624-1115.

without supervision or eye
protection.

In the mid-1970s, indoor
tanning began to gain popular-
ity. Since then, there have
been numerous reports of
immediate injuries, such as
skin and eye burns, that have
resulted from the misuse of
tanning beds. As painful as
these injuries may be, they
generally heal within weeks. It
is the long—term effects of
which users need to be aware.

Tanning beds emit UV radi-
ation, which increases the risk
of cellular damage, premature
aging of the skin and skin can-
cer, especially in fair-skinned
individuals. Year-round visits
toitanning salons can deny
skin the winter break it would
normally get from high-inten-
sity UV rays. Recent animal
studies suggest that individu-
als may be more likely to get

same-sex marriages, homosexu-
al employees have less of a
chance of acquiring health care

Henson argued the university
decides who is covered by
health care benefits and can
change this policy based on mar-
ital status. In her complaint she
asked for her partner to be
enrolled in the health care policy
and reimbursement for the
denied coverage since her hiring.

Henson began challenging the
university’s policy two weeks
after being hired in" July 1994,
but enlisted the ACLU to file her
complaint in January claiming
that this discrimination made her
contract less valuable than a het-
erosexual employee’s. The
ACLU will continue to pursue
the complaint following
Henson’s resignation.

The policy is also in violation
of Pitt’s own Non-discrimination
Policy, Henson said. In Nov.
1994 the University Senate’s
Anti-Discrimination Committee
investigated the complaint and
found the health insurance poli-
cy to be discriminatory against
gay men and lesbians. Still, the
Board of Trustees remained
reluctant to make changes.

“The hostile climate is largely
due to the Board of Trustees fail-
ure to give real meaning to the
promises contained in the Non-
discrimination Statement,”
Henson said. “I think many
groups feel that way, not just les-
bians and gays.”

Vendor supplies students with the book experience

By Laura Auerbach
For The Pitt News

A 48-year-old man sits in Schenley
Cafe and adjusts his wire frames as
he reads James Joyce’s Lin.

, You have probably seen Robert
Waskowicz behind stacks of books
and never really knew who he was.
He is the used book vendor who qui-
etly passes his Mondays in the
William Pitt Union as he enjoys his
favorite pastime — reading.

“It’s my ‘clique time”’, quietly
sighs Waskowicz. “I guess books

have always provided me comfort.”

Where else can he spend his day
working while enjoying what he
loves most? Selling used books to a
various array of students and faculty
isn’t his occupation. Waskowicz has a
used bookstore in Indiana called The
Book Experience.

His lifetime dream to own a store_

came into being about four years ago.
Before that, he did everything from
“[teaching] at a junior community
college to selling encyclopedias door-
to-door, and everything in between.”
The dream began seven years ago

when he started selling books at ﬂea
markets. He once asked another used
bookstore owner how to make a liv-
ing and the reply "was “you won’t get
rich, but you’ll be happy.” Besides
his profession of choice, his life is
coupled with a supportive wife of 24
years and two daughters, ages 18 and
20. As well as being an Order Entry
Coordinator at Latrobe Hospital, his
wife is just as involved in the opera-
tion. They share everything, includ-
ing the stacks of several thousand
books that make up their personal
library.

Waskowicz occasionally gets rare
books — usually few and far
between. Still, he is an avid reader.
Besides trying to satisfy his hunger
by reading every author he can get
his hands on, Waskowicz one day has
aspirations of writing his own book.
It will be a satire on life. Meanwhile,
Waskowicz will enjoy meeting lots of
people “who have interesting anec-
dotes about life,” as he laughs about
trashy romance novels. “The poor
ugly duckling marries the richest man
in the world after escaping from the
evilest man in the world.”

“I think [McDonald’s] vote is
a result of ‘seeing the interest in

something that never goes
away.”

Pitt administrators are delight-
ed at the news of the test closing.

Vice-Chancellor of Student
and Public Affairs Leon Haley
said that even a temporary clos-
ing will benefit the Oakland
community.

“I’m delighted, as are many of
my colleagues and, obviously,
many students who must cross
that street,” Haley said. “We
think the test will have a positive
impact on the Oakland commu-
nity at large, and specifically the
students who will now have a
safe egress to the Cathedral
between classes.”

Haley also said that he hoped
the closing will result in a more
uniﬁed campus.

“We hope the studies which
will occur on Oakland traffic
patterns during the test closing,
will permit a more permanent
closing of the boulevard down
the line,” Haley said. “This
would result in a continuous
campus extending from Bouquet
Street to Bellefield street
between Fifth Avenue and
Forbes. This space will provide
a wide area for a variety of stu-
dent activities.”

Heffron added that the SGB,
with the help of other student
groups, plans to utilize the tem-
porary closing.

“We want to prove that this
will be a great addition to the
city,” he said.

Keyes

°From page 1

Keyes, a two-tirne Republican
nominee for the U.S. Senate in
Maryland, also took the oppor-
tunity to speak about his mixed
feelings for President Clinton.

“Bill Clinton is one of, if not
the worst, presidents we have
had in my life,” Keyes said.

But Keyes thanked the
Clinton administration for “wak-
ing up” the American people
and giving Republicans the
opportunity to win so many
seats in 1994. Keyes believes
that Clinton is “committed to all
the wrong things.” V

‘The Lord works in mysteri-
ous ways,” Keyes said. “We
have seen all kinds of policies
that destroy family life. We need
to get moving to preserve these
things.”

Keyes criticized “wishy- _

washy” Republicans for leaving
the party’s goals and still calling
themselves “conservatives” and
party leaders for focusing on
economic solutions to moral
problems. '

Keyes admitted that a
Princeton poll showed that the
number of Americans that place
high importance on jobs, eco-
nomic security and money was
in the 50 percent range. Buthe
sighted the same poll as noting
that 69 percent valued educa-
tion, 73 percent wonied about
the decline in the family unit and
63 percent were concerned. for
the young people in our society.

“These issues are more impor-
tant to people [than economics]
because they are not just striking
home, but striking the home,”
Keyes said.

“We are in the midst of a crisis
that is as bad or worse than any
war.” Keyes continued, “We
have a body count that is very
real.”

Keyes said that if the econo-
my was at the root of the prob-
lem, America wouldn’t have
these problems in the wealthier
neighborhoods, and that inhis
campaign travels; he noticed the
same “pattern of tragedy” no
matter where he spoke.

“No economic policy will
save us from government domi-
nation. If as a people, we lose
the moral wherewithal to control
ourselves, then the government
will have to take over that con-
trol,” Keyes said. “We have a
lack of understanding of the real

nature of the moral issues we are _

confronted with.”

Keyes, a father of three who
has consistently defended
unborn children, also spoke out
against abortion and against
people that opposed it solely
because it was “brutal.”

“You can call it a procedure,
but when you get down to it, it is
the torture of fully-formed
infants,” Keyes said. “The real
reason to oppose abortion is
because in principle it contra-
dicts every decent value this
nation is based on.”

He ended by saying that the
fundamental premise of freedom
in this country is that rights
don’t depend on human choice:
they are “endowed by the
Creator."

“My dignity comes from
God.” Keyes said.

Opinions
Dark sky over Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh’s economy is currently being threatened by another
potentially deadly blow. According to yesterday’s Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, if USAir does not make some kind of partnership, buyout or
merger with another airline soon, the company’s future could be in
danger.

Pittsburgh’s four-year-old international airport serves as a hub for
USAir. Over 90 percent of ﬂights in and out of Pittsburgh are USAir
ﬂights, and many ﬂights between several East Coast cities are only run
by USAir.

USAir is the nation’s sixth largest airline, but in 1995 it was ranked
seventh for quality. That rank has dropped from fifth place two years
ago. Adding to its problems, the airline is plagued by high costs and
high prices. .

If USAir is forced out of business, Pittsburgh will be struck hard.
But USAir employees will not be the only ones affected. Much of
Pittsburgh’s economy is driven by money from people who ﬂy into the
city on business, stop here on a layover or find themselves in our air-
port for whatever reason. Airline employees will ﬁnd themselves in the
unemployment office, likely standing beside former airport employees,
local hotel and restaurant employees.

Coming soon... The End

This is it. T minus 10 days and counting. Seniors will be graduating
soon, and undergraduates (mostly) get to take a four—month break. So,
in light of this being one of our last opportunities, let us impart some of
our inﬁnite seniorial wisdom regarding the last two weeks of school.

First, it is supposed to be near 80 degrees this weekend (even though
it did snow a little yesterday). Don’t let this weather fool you into
thinking the sun will cook knowledge into your brain. Finals are next
week, so don’t forget to study. It will probably (though you can never
be certain in Pittsburgh) still be nice out on April 28.

Next, if whatever you are doing in the computer lab is not of vital
importance to some class you are taking this semester, don’t waste

"everyone else’s time. Too many people are waiting far too long for you

to ﬁnish that last round of Mortal Kombat 48. People have real-life
work to do, so cut the Net surﬁng, too. And if you are doing real work,
don’t think you can try to print out that 20-page term paper ﬁve min-
utes before your class starts. Printers can be backed up for hours at this
time of year. Give yourself plenty of time.

Finally, don’t make yourself crazy. If you feel the stress hitting you
too hard, take a break for an hour, take a walk, get a drink, practice jug-
gling, whatever. Don’t let yourself get too far away from your books,
but it’s OK to take a break and return to reality for a few minutes.

However you deal with the next two weeks, good luck We wish you
the best during ﬁnals and the rest of your college career. Or if this is it
for you, too, good luck in whatever you do. '

Swimming with unenlightened sharks

CHTUNG, LITTLE
ASAMPERSH When we
gress to our casa de
padres (go look up egress), we
will find that things have
changed some from what we
remember. Dad will not seem as
open to new ideas on the topic of
bisexual philanthropism as you
may have hoped. Mom will be
agog at accusations of “perpetu-
ating repressive paternal aggres-
sion,” and they will definitely
want you to contribute to the
economic well-being of the
familial unit.

In other words, Ma & Pa live
hr the real world and want you to
get a job and remove your sony
ass from bed prior to 3 p.m.
While it’s all well and good to
mouth the rhetoric of the day
back to your professors (the
most fanatic of which are, as we
all know, the grad students), it
ain’t gonna cut it in your home
life. The indoctrination period is
over and you must now swim
into the ocean filled with unen-
lightened sharks. You will no
longer be able to mouth some
platitudes when the bills come
due. In case you are a little slow
here, I’ll help you out with what
I mean. For instance, let’s look at
some views on education.

One of my advisors told me
that she has “been on the cross of
education for more than 15
years.” Well, I’ve given that
some thought and it offends me
that education is compared to
cruciﬁxion for a teacher. It seems
to me that if you’re sulfering in
your job, then you’re an idiot to
stay and continue to suffer for
ingrates such as my own humble
self. As a side note: do you want
to be taught by someone who
claims martyrdom for their man-
tle and is too dumb to leave? I
don’t think so. Ever tried being a
student in this Puzzle Palace
(what some people refer to as the
Cathedral of Learning)? Sister, if
it’s that bad, climb on down and
peddle your skills to a politician
or some other such vermin.

A grad student instructor here
once remarked, “The purpose of

Patrick '
McKelvey

college is to challenge your
belief systems.” Really? I

‘thought the idea was to pursue

an area of personal interest in
higher education in order to
facilitate (that word sends a chill
down my spine) improvement in
your depth of knowledge and
skills in hopes of getting a better
job. So there. '

As for my “belief systems,”
how can we assess whether or
not they are challenged? Do I
spout the “correct” rhetoric and
thereby demonstrate my “intel—
lectual growth?” What if I
understand the teacher’s philo-
sophical (you can substitute the
word POLITICAL) agenda, and
I just don’t agree? Are we casti-
gated-through grading for our
apparent narrowness? Take a
guess, little campers, take a
guess. Most of us are here on
borrowed cash, and I know
bookies that are more forgiving
than PHEAA. We can do just as
well without the indoctrination.
Thanks, but no thanks.

On the other hand, it may be
my narrow-minded outlook to
expect excellence from my pro-
fessors. And I do mean profes-
sors, NOT grad students paying
for their tuition. Hey, we’re pay-
ing hard-borrowed cash here.
Yet as always I digress, the point
here is  is  relating to Mom
and Pop what you got out of
their investment in you and this
fine bastion of higher propagan-
da.

Maybe you’ve grown out of
your limited people skills that
made you such a loner in
Podunk High School. Maybe
you joined one of the frats on
campus that still has charges
pending or has not expelled from
the university altogether. Perhaps
you have discovered your “true
sexuality” and just need to join
whichever organization will call
my home at the most armoying
hours and demand money from
me for your rights (here’s a hint:
DON’T) and attempt to enlight-

en me to your plight. Maybe
you’ve decided to teach “New
Age Philosophy of the
Oppressed Masses” to the privi-
leged children of suburban
America. (Attending that
English writing class just
“opened your eyes” to the
unfairness of it all. Pardon me
while I step outside to projectile
vomit ...)

OK, I’m back. Most of all, you
may want to share with the par-
ents that your new calling is poli-
tics when they ask where you
got that really expensive looking
computer. (Sorry, Andy, I just
couldn’t help myself. Then
again, neither could you and
your money-grubbing SGB
cronies.) Finally, you may have
realized that you can do some-
thing for the homeless  lobby

for the three-strikes law to incar-

cerate panhandlers in Oakland.

Basically, I hope that Mom’s
little camper can adjust to life
outside the forrnica tower of Pitt.
All my caustic commentary
aside (most of it, anyway), if you
must share with Mom & Pop,
tell them that you don’t like liv-
ing in a slum with a roommate
that smokes in the bathroom and
picks his toenails while watching
“Beavis & Butthead.” Tell Dad
that you agree that the NRA is
the only way, and ask for a carry
permit for Christmas if he forces
you to return to this institution.
And mention the fact that the
“O” and City Council don’t
seem to care if you get run down
on Bigelow Boulevard. When
they ask about your intentions
for life, say, “Live with you guys
until I’m 25, of course. Got any
brewskis in the house? What
ever happened to that spare set
of car keys anyway?”

Or you may go with option B.
Get a summer job that allows
you to work on your tan, drink
copious quantities of beerand
forget all about this place until
next fall. I’ll be coming back to
keep you informed.

Patrick McKelvey has no regrets
or apologies to convey.

All you can

Columnist
Kevin
Lilley

arring a really, really
B‘ last-minute editor’s

strike, this will be
my final column of the
year. So, I’d like to take
this opportunity to give an
honest, blunt summary of
the year in Pitt sports.

Unfortunately, this is a
family newspaper (kind of),
so I can’t be too direct
about it.

A friend of mine had a
similar problem a few years
ago. Before he wrote his
message into my junior
high yearbook, he asked if
he could use any profanity.

’ I told him no —- my mother

was going to read it, and
she wasn’t too fond of this
kid to begin with.

So, instead of his original
idea, he wrote: “It’s been a
bleep year. Have a nice
summer.”

Simple, direct, clean,
poignant. And, most impor-
tantly, quite applicable to
what was supposed to be a
breakthrough year for so
many Pitt sports teams.

It all started so innocently
— two wins by the Pitt
football team at home, on
beautiful, late-summer
nights with underage
Zelda’s customers stum-
bling through the stands
and ZBT rush advertise-
ments flashing on the score-
board. Back then, we
thought there was a special
season coming.

Of course, back then, we
thought O.J. would be con-
victed and the Beatles were
finished making albums.
Nobody ever accused us of
working for the Psychic
Hotline.

Before we could say
“Dorsett,” Pitt dropped nine
straight. None were all that
close. Most weren’t all that
fun to watch. Some were
embarrassing.

Ohio State put enough red
coats into the Pitt stands to
outfit the Canadian
Mounties, and then pro-
ceeded to beat the Panthers
to a bloody pulp on national
television. Miami wrecked
a perfectly rainy homecom-

Fletcher heads SAII-Piﬂ News Team

Trocksfer wins honor for third-straight year

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

The suspense is over.

Finally, Najuma Fletcher
can relax. She can clear any
doubts that remain from her
stellar track career and can
chalk up another accolade.

Because yesterday she
won The Pitt News athlete
of the year award for an
unprecedented third time in
a row. The 13-time All-
American edged out Pitt
diver John Soulakis by two
votes in this year’s annual
poll from The Pitt News’
sports staff.

Tying for third were two
athletes from teams that had
disappointing seasons in the
won-loss column — foot-
ball’s Dietrich Jells and

women’s hoopster Latia.

Howard. Rounding out the
1995-1996 All-Pitt News
team are All-Am_erican
wrestler Mark Bodo and
soccer goalkeeper Adam
Spitzer.

But Fletcher grabbed the
top spot, a position she’s
definitely comfortable occu-
pying. Born in Guyana,
Fletcher ranks as one of the
greatest athletes ever at Pitt.
3 Along with her multiple
All—American ' status,
Fletcher is a 15-time Big
East champion, and she’s
won the Big East indoor and

outdoor performer of the
year the past two seasons.
Also, she’s a three-time Big
East academic'All-Star. Last
week, the Pitt Athletic
department awarded
Fletcher with the two most

father, uncle and cousin are

Soulakis has qualified for
the NCAAs twice and has
been named captain of the
swim team the past two sea-

 
 
  

sons. His sophomore season
he earned honorable All-
American recognition with a
13th place finish in platform
diving. At, this year’s

-NCAAS, he placed 18th in t

the three-meter and plat-
form, and 19th on the one-
meter board.

Jells is the only two-sport
star on the All-Pitt News
team. His standout sport is
football, where the speedy
wideout set all-time records
for receptions and yards this
year. The Erie native, who
doubles as a trackster, was
also one of five seniors who
was given a Senior of
Distinction award by the
Pitt Athletic Department.

Along with the records
and track accomplishments,
Jells w-as one of the few
attractions for Panther foot-
ball fans this season. He
returned punts and kicks and
was always a threat to get in
the end zone.

Howard suffered a similar
fate as Jells — a strong
individual season for a dis-
mal team.‘ The junior for-
ward scored 13.6 points‘ per
game and pulled in a team-
high 7.3 boards per game
for the Lady Panthers this
year. But the Panthers were
bitten by the losing bug, fin-
ishing the year at 6-24.

Spitzer was a bright spot

Lacrosse takes two of three to end season

By Matt Townsend
Staff Writer

Pitt’s men’s lacrosse team
won two out of three games
over the past week to finish
the season with a 10-5
record.

Last ’Wednesday, Pitt lost
12-4 to Grove City College.
On Thursday, it beat West
Virginia, for the first time
in five years, 9-8. On
Sunday, Pitt walloped
Wheeling College 15-3.

The loss at Grove City
knocked the Panthers out of
the playoffs.

“People weren’t trying
against Grove City,” said
Captain Dave Walter.

After the debacle against
Grove City, the team had a
meeting before the West
Virginia game. Captains
Walter and John Foris tried
to regroup the team before
the game. .

“We pulled everyone
aside before the game and
told them we want people
out there that are going to
try,” said Walter. “If you’re
going to be on the lacrosse
field. you got to give 100
percent.”

The little chat worked as
Pitt jumped all over the
Mountaineers in the first

quarter with a 3-0 lead. Pitt
played its best lacrosse of
the year in the first.

“They played tremen-
dous,” said Coach Gary
Neff. “Every single one of
them gave their all for this
game. They never gave up,
and they wouldn’t let them
get ahead. Everyone played
hard, and it showed what
kind of potential we have.”

Midfielder Rob Heaps got
Pitt off early with the first
of his four goals only a few
minutes into the game. He
caught a pass 30 feet in
front of the net. Then, he
ran to his right with a
defender on him and sud-
denly put down a bounce
shot that surprised the
goalie.

“Rob had a tremendous
game like he usually does,”
said Neff.

Next, Walter tried to get a
pass to Polecritti for a one-
timer, but the shot was
blocked. Meyer-Kincak
then picked up the ground
ball and netted one between
the goalie’s legs putting Pitt
up by two. Heaps added his
second goal during a Pitt
man-up when a rebound
bounced to him. ,

West Virginia caught fire
at the beginning of the sec‘-

 

ond quarter by scoring
three quick goals to knot
the score at three. Pitt
seemed to have lost its fire
and its momentum. Then
Heaps scored on an individ-
ual effort when he curled
from around the back of the

net to the front and scored
on a low liner. A

The goal swayed the
momentum back to Pitt and
proceeded to run off fou:
unanswered goals, putting
the Panthers up 7-3.

The tournament was open to
anyone 24 years old or
younger. Besides Payne,
four other Pitt wrestlers
made the trip, but Payne’s
performance was the high-
light of the meet. He won
the title over 31 other
wrestlers in the 198
pound/90 kilogram weight
class in convincing fashion.

The final match was
almost anti—climactic. The
biggest match was Payne’s
semifinal bout. He faced
Quincy Clark, a former
NCAA runner-up from the
University of Oklahoma.

“I wrestled him two years
ago, and he beat me handi-
ly,” Payne said. “That was
in the back of my mind. But
I also knew I had improved
since then.”.

Apparently, he improved
more than‘ he thought.
Payne crushed Clark, win-
ning the semifinal match by
technical fall and breezing
through the finals.

The national champi-
onship opened some doors
for Payne, including an
upcoming world champi-
onship meet, and possibly
even the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.

“I’ve never won a tourna-
ment of this magnitude

‘before. The Olympics are

something to contemplate
now,” Payne said.
Four other Pitt wrestlers

. made the trip with Payne,

with generally positive

results.

Larry “The Tattooed
Warrior” Sprecher had an
early exit from the tourna-
ment, going 0-2. Sprecher
spent the rest of the week-
end being a cheerleader for
the other wrestlers.

“When I came off the mat
after that final match,
[Sprecher’s] smile was big-
ger than mine,” Payne said.

Bryan Matusic went 4-2 at
the tournament. One of his
losses was to Rick Hepp, a
former All-American who

went on to win the weight

class.

Jon Hazi was fourth place
in Greco-Roman and John
Withrow went 8-2 in 10
bouts over two days to fin-
ish fifth in his weight class.

see a light at the end of the
tunnel.

Or, more accurately, a
light on the top of the Field
House. Midnight Madness
was upon us, and as the fab
five freshmen showed off
their dunks and Coach
Ralph Willard promised a
winning program, we all
felt that this hoops season

i would be something to

remember.

We also felt that the
Steelers weren’t good ,
enough to go deep into the
playoffs, and that Bob Dole
was too old to run for pres-
ident. Quick, somebody
fetch that Hotline number.

Coach Willard delivered,
for about 39-and-change
minutes a game. Instead of
rainy blowouts, roundball
fans were treated to last
second, death-defying
matchups with the top
teams in the nation, includ-
ing an overtime barn-burn-
er with then-undefeated
UMass.

Problem is, the NCAA
has this annoying habit of
using the score at the very
end of the game for the
record book. And, at the
very end of almost every
game, the fans were usually
doing advanced math dur-
ing the timeouts, trying to
figure out how a team can
lose a double-digit lead
during a commercial break.
It’s anybody’s guess what
the team was doing during
timeouts, but it sure wasn’t
helping.

The whole year was
close, but no cigar. Kind of
like a Bud Light commer-
cial starring Andre Alridge
as that “I love you, man!”
guy, only not quite as
funny.

Another bleep season.
But out of the ashes of the
men’s team came Coach
Kirk Bruce and his
women’s squ...oh, forget it.

And so goes major Pitt
athletics, where “postsea-
son p1ay” meant “spring
practice” for yet another
season. It’s been a bleep

" sports year, everybody. _

Have a nice summer.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, April 17, 1996

Lacrosse

°From page 9

Halfway into the third quarter,
West Virginia put together a string
of four goals to tie the game again
at seven.

With the game tied, Pitt looked to
Heaps again, and he scored on a
blistering shot that the Mountaineer
goalie couldn’t catch up to. West
Virginia had its chance to score,
but second-half goalie John
McGrath made several saves.

After Pitt went up 8-7, the
Mountaineers self-destructed. One
defender got two penalties on the
same play, both for slashes to the
head.

Then a technical foul was
assessed to a Mountaineer for a
blatant two-handed chop with his
stick. In all, Pitt had eight minutes
of penalties in which to try to put
the game away.

The Panthers couldn’t capitalize
until the end of the penalty, when a

‘ check by
P o l e c r i t t i

knocked the ball loose and Heaps
started a fast break. Heaps went to
Choi, and he passed up field to
Mike Tanniru, who waited and
passed to a cutting Matt
Haplamazian for a quick stick and a
9-7 lead. West Virginia scored with
50 seconds, but could get no closer.
“Against Wheeling, Pitt finished
the season strong with a 15-3 drub-
bing. Walter and Pat Shea both
scored hat tricks. Polecritti,
Tanniru and Haplamzian scored two
each. Even goalie Dave Travis
played some offense and scored.

“We played well. We totally out-
matched them,” said Neff.

As for the season, Neff was dis-
appointed that they didn’t make the
playoffs. He is anxious for next
year, because they aren’t losing
anyone and he has some good
freshmen coming in.

“We were a very young team this
year, and it showed in how we
played up and down all season.
Next year everyone will have a
year of playing together under their
belt, which will make us a better
team,” said Neff.

unusual for Pitt athletics
this year, finished better
then expectations. Head
Coach Joe Luxabacher’s
team finished 13-5, 8-3 in
the Big East with Spitzer in
goal. He was a key reason
behindthe season, orabbing
a decision in every game.
He had seven shutouts and
1.04 goals against average.

Bodo was a leader of the
wrestling team that sent
five grapplers to the NCAA
