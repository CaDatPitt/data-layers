Student praises fall of Marcos

By Leeli Davidson
Staff Writer

From San Francisco to New York,
Philippine—Americans this week
celebrated the fall of the Marcos
regime. ,

On Feb. 25, President Ferdinand E.
Marcos ﬂed his royal palace in Manila.
Corazon C. Aquino replaced him as
leader of the Philippines.

One jubilant Pitt student, Nora
Palugod, a Filipino, expressed her joy
on Marcos’ departure and her hopes for
the future of the Philippines. Palugod
also offered her views on America’s in-
volvement in the affairs of her country.

Palugod has been completing a
masters‘ program at the Graduate
School of Public and International Af-
fairs since August of 1985. In the
Philippines, Palugod worked for 10
years for the government in the
Ministry of Planning.

About her views of the United States,
Palugod said she thinks she speaks for
the majority of Filipinos when she says
that she likes the American people but
that she dislikes President Reagan.

Palugod traces the beginnings of
serious dissatisfaction with Reagan on
the part of the Philippine people to a
speech given by Vice President Bush
in the Philippines in 1981. Bush, ac-
cording to Palugod, praised the Philip-
pines’ democracy.

Referring to Bush’s speech, Palugod
said, “The Philippine people were
outraged by Bush’s statement that he
loved the type of democracy we had in
the Philippines.

“There was no democracy!”
Palugod exclaimed.

Another incident that contributed to
the strained relationship between the

Filipino people and Reagan, Palugod
said, was the death of Benigno Aquino,
whom Palugod now considers to be a
martyr. New President Aquino is his
widow.

Benigno Aquino was a national hero
and an opposition leader in the Philip-
pines. Opposition leaders believed that
he could defeat Marcos in an election.
On returning to the Philippines from a
three-year self—imposed exile, Aquino
was assassinated at the Manila Inter-
national Airport. Many opposition
members believe that Ferdinand Mar-
cos ordered his death, but it was never
proven in court that a military con-
spiracy was behind Aquino’s death.

The death of Aquino made the
Philippine people loathe Reagan,
because, said Palugod, Filipinos were
aghast that Reagan could still support
Marcos after it seemed apparent that he
had been behind Aquino’s assassina-
tion.

Although Palugod dislikes Reagan,
she begrudgingly admits that, this past
week, he was instrumental in bringing
about a peaceful transition in govern-
ment. “Marcos stepped down because
President Reagan didn’t support him
anymore,” she said.

Palugod said she was uncertain of
what future U.S.-Philippine relations
would be.

Turning to the topic of President
Aquino, Palugod asserted absolute faith
in Aquino’s ability to handle the com-
plex, trouble-ridden Philippine govem-
ment. President Aquino has an “enor-
mous task” in front of her, said
Palugod.

“Besides the economic problems she
has to face," said Palugod, “Mrs.
Aquino has to deal with a demoralized
army. Marcos not only destroyed the
economy, he destroyed the institutions
of the Philippines.”

Palugod said she hopes that, under
President Aquino, the Philippines will
become a thriving capitalist country.

Palugod, on the question of the
Philippine communist insurgents, was
also sure that President Aquino would
have a beneficial effect upon them.

President Aquino inherits from Mar-
cos, besides a ﬂagging economic
system, a violent conﬂict with com-

Helmut Schmidt’s lecture at Pitt
Wednesday night was a lesson in the
dangers of the United States practicing
parochial economic policies in today’s
complex world. “You’d better with-
hold your applause until you’ve heard
what I’m about to say,” were his open-
ing words. ‘

Displaying a grasp of the complex-
ities of global economics found in few
politicians today, Schmidt warned that
growing deﬁcits in this country and in
countries all over the world threaten to
produce political instabilities of fright-
ening proportions.

The relationship between the U.S.
debt and global political instability is
difficult to understand; in his lecture
Schmidt was quick to point out that
“balance of payments” and “current
accounts” have little meaning even for
some of the United States’ respected
politicians. For a statesman of
Schmidt’s stature, however, changes in
these variables of a foreign nation’s
economy signify the global repercus-
sions of U.S. economic policies.

Perhaps one need remember only a
single aspect of the U.S. budget deﬁcit
to grasp its international significance:
debts must be repaid. In very simpliﬁed
form, Schmidt’s analysis went some-
thing like this:

0 The U.S. economy is improving
because the government is spending
more money than it actually has, which
it is able to do by borrowing money.

0 Since the United States has one of
the smallest pools of national savings
in the world, we must borrow that

money from abroad (e.g. West
Germany).

0 To obtain that money from abroad,
the United States raises interest rates
so other countries will “invest” in us
with the knowledge that they will get
back more than they put in.

0 This foreign money coming into
the U.S. debt, so to speak, keeps those
countries from investing in new in-
dustries and subsequently from creating
new jobs in their economies.

Schmidt was unequivocal about the
United States ultimately having to pay
off its debts one way or another. “Your

' debt," he said. “is a standing invita-'

tion to future leaders to print money,
which is inﬂationary, or if you should
be able to keep Volcker in office an-
other 10 years, you will have to raise
taxation.”

The equation is in fact much more
complex..High interest rates, for ex-
ample, make it increasingly difﬁcult for
other nations to pay back their own
debts, which they must do in the
world’s strongest currency, U.S. dol-
lars. Many other variables not men-
tioned here come into play, as Schmidt
explained. A

In essence, however, the results are
the same throughout the world: slow
growth and high unemployment. “Hit-
ler,” Schmidt said with the weight of
his nation’s history behind his words,
“would not have come to power if
there had not been such high unem-
ployment for so long a period of time. ”

Noting the recent advent of France’s
right—wing party, the National Front,
Schmidt said, “Even in a country with
long-standing democratic traditions, 10
percent of the people voted for the Na-
tional Front out of despair.”

IFC concedes to dry rush policy

By Michele Kiraly
Staff Writer

Despite an earlier dispute between
the Interfraternity Council and Pitt’s
administration about dry rush, IFC
recently appointed a special group to
formulate the guidelines that will
govern “dry rush” next September.

The Greek Committee on Rush
Policy is headed by Mike King of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

“I believe that with this appointment,
the conﬂict that arose between the ad-
ministration and the IFC regarding the
dry rush aspect can be considered ter-
minated,” IFC president Nasos
Georgiadis stated in a letter to Student
Activities Director Andrew Smith.

The conﬂict developed after the ad-
ministration decided to initiate a com-
pletely dry rush period in the fall of
1986, under the belief that rush with
alcohol is a failure.

“We have compiled statistics (from
the last ﬁve rush periods) that show,
while people are going .to the frater-
nities for parties, fewer are signing up
to join them,” Smith said in a recent

interview with The Pitt News. “Arid by
the laws of the state of Pennsylvania,
a wet rush is illegal.”

IFC opposed the decision, according
to Georgiadis, “because the issue here
is not alcohol but rather our right to
have private functions during rush.

“I want it to be known that we were
given no option regarding dry rush,”
he said. “It was a no—choice situation.”
Regarding the formation of the com-
mittee, he said, “We also realized that
the sooner we organized and did so
with interest, the more beneﬁcial the
outcome would be.”

Georgiadis added that dry rush is
here to stay and it must be utilized to
the fullest beneﬁts. “I am optimistic,”
he said. “But the campus must
cooperate in order for the Greek system
to prosper.”

The IFC president, however, did ex-
press his concern for the success of dry
rush. “We understand that a dry rush
has worked at other colleges but Pitt
is unique,” he said. “It’s primarily a
commuter campus.”

Bridget Guernsey, assistant director
of Student Activities, said she is con-
ﬁdent that the fratemities can do just

as well without alcohol during the rush
period. “Fraternities have a great deal
to offer all around,” she said.
“Students will join to reap the beneﬁts
of them.”

Guernsey highlighted a few plans
regarding dry rush. “Fraternity
representatives will attend a national
workshop that will supply them with
information and suggestions for ac-
tivities during dry rush,” Guernsey
said. “Also, their national chapters will
advise them.” ‘

Guernsey said that IFC will sponsor
events‘ to showcase the fraternities. But
it will be up to the individual frater-
nities to get the unafﬁliated young men
to the houses.

What will result from dry rush?

“Freshmen won’t realize the dif-
ference during the rush period since it
will be their ﬁrst. Fewer students may
register for rush but a larger number
of them will pledge. And upper-
classmen will have to get used to it,”
Guernsey said.

Georgiados said the committee is
currently composing the guidelines of
dry rush. They will be available within
several days.

MANILA, Philippines — Philippine
President Corazon Aquino released 33
political prisoners yesterday as she
began the job of national reconciliation
after taking power from ousted Presi-
dent Ferdinand Marcos. One prisoner
being freed is an alleged Central Com-
mittee member of the outlawed Com-
munist Party of the Philippines. Some
of the others are leaders of the so—called
“Light a Fire Movement,” believed to
be responsible for a series of terrorist
bombings in 1979.

Aquino rejected suggestions that the
Communist Party be legalized —— but
stood by previous pledges to offer a six-
month cease-fire to the party’s
16,000-strong military wing, the New
People’s Army. The chairman of the
Civil Liberties Union of the Philippines
said Aquino's new 17-member cabinet
is basically conservative.

Military intelligence officers are
reported to be holding the mayor of the
capital of Marcos’ home province and
nine aides and bodyguards in an alleged
plot to murder Aquino and her defense
minister, Juan Ponce Enrile. The
Manila Times said the investigation
followed the seizure of 16 guns in cars
outside the Defense Ministry where the
mayor, his aides and bodyguards were
visiting Enrile on Wednesday. The
paper quoted intelligence officers as
having said teams had been sent out to
assassinate him.

Liberian tanker

struck by missile

LONDON — Shipping insurer
Lloyds of London said an air-launched
missile hit a Liberian supertanker near
Iran’s main oil terminal in the Persian
Gulf, causing minor damage. Iraq said
it hit three “naval targets,” which in
the past has usually meant tankers.

Tainted Tylenol
under investigation

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The FDA
will run tests on the Tylenol capsule
found under the deathbed of a Nashville
man whose body contained a fatal dose
of cyanide. Tennessee has banned the
sale of capsule Tylenol, but a Nashville
police detective said he doubts the
man’s death is linked to the New York
incidents. In Washington, the FBI an-
nounced that it believes the cyanide
used in the New York case was put in
the capsules after they were sealed in
so-called tamper-resistant bottles.

New evidence
in shuttle explosion

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. —
There is new evidence that the rubber
seals on the shuttle’s solid-fuel boosters
might be the culprits behind the
Challenger disaster. Previously
unreleased color photos more clearly
pinpoint a puff of black smoke from
Challenger’s right booster rocket at the
moment of ignition. NASA engineer
Charles Stevenson told the Presidential
Investigating Committee that the smoke
appears to come from a “leak" in the
right booster rocket joint. In earlier pic-
tures, the location of the origin of the
smoke was not clear.

Reagan lobbies

for military budget

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan used a nationally broadcast
speech last night to lobby for his

  

military budget. The president urged
the American people to pressure their
senators and representatives to pass his
$311 million defense budget. Reagan
said the military buildup during the past
five years forced the Soviets to serious-
ly think about cutting their nuclear
arsenal.

Cairo riots
under control

CAIRO, Egypt — The Egyptian
government said 32 policemen, two
soldiers and two civilians died during
the rioting by disgruntled police con-
scripts and others that began Tuesday
and which was crushed by army units
backed by tanks and helicopter gun-
ships. More than 350 people were in-
jured and more than 2,000 policemen
and several hundred civilians were ar-
rested. Cairo remains under a curfew.
The rioters burned down three luxury
hotels and nearly a dozen restaurants
and nightclubs near the Pyramids.

Aldrin to appear on
“Punky Brewster”

NEW YORK — Buzz Aldrin, the
second man to walk on the moon, will
appear as himself in aspecial episode
of NBC’s “Punky Brewster,” March
9. The show deals with children’s fears
and feelings in theaftermath of the
space shuttle disaster. Aldrin had to
rearrange a busy schedule to appear on
the program but thought it worthwhile.
He said an appearance on the show
would be “an excellent opportunity to
make a contribution to the young peo-
ple who watch the program as far as
their response to the accident.”

Russian Cosmos
burns in re—entry

WASHINGTON — The U.S of-
ﬁcials said a Soviet satellite which may
have had a nuclear power plant aboard
re-entered the earth’s atmosphere and
“burned out” over north-central
Australia early yesterday. Officials at
the North American Aerospace
Defense Command said the re—entry
was tracked on radar. There are no
reports of anyone sighting debris.
NORAD representatives said all indica-
tions are that the Soviet Cosmos burned
out in the atmosphere, although it is
possible pieces could survive re—entry.

Killer bees
nearing U.S.

WASHINGTON —- U.S. ofﬁcials
said a migration of so-called killer bees
is getting closer. The aggressive bees
are expected to move into Texas or
Arizona by 1988 or 1989. A swarm
was wiped out in California last year.
Scientists said they are stocking up on
their arsenal of weapons against the
killer bees. The bees don’t sting any
worse than normal bees, but they sting
10 times more often.

Soviet defector
to become citizen

WASHINGTON -— Arkady Shev-
chenko will be sworn in as an
American citizen in Washington, D.C.
soon. He was a former high—ranking
Soviet United Nations delegate who
turned to spying for the United States.

The Pitt News, February 28, 1986

    

     
 

Professing a love for his country and
the Soviet people, Shevchenko said he
doesn’t love the Soviet government and
that becoming an American will be the
finest day of his life. The 55-year-old
Shevchenko did have one regret, that
his daughter would not be with him
tomorrow.

Indian plane
destroyed by bomb

India — The judge investigating the
Air India crash off the Irish coast last
June apparently concluded that a bomb
destroyed the plane, killing all 329 peo-
ple aboard. The Press trust of India said
the 200-page report submitted to the
Aviation Ministry upholds the testi-
mony of several experts that a bomb
went off in the front cargo hold of the
Boeing 747. The ﬁndings have not been
officially released, and the judge
declined to comment.

Reagan urges support for de

By Teresa Candori
Staff ‘Writer

President Reagan. in response to
declining support for his defense pro-
grams. warned the nation Tuesday
night of the danger of reducing his
military budget request for $320
billion.

“Any slackening now. would invite
the very dangers America must avoid."
he said. “And could fatally com-
promise our negotiating position.”

Reagan said that to cut defense
spending is “not safe,” and he called
it “reckless, dangerous and wrong."

“Just as we are sitting down at the
bargaining table with the Soviets,” he

said. "lets not throtv .»\merica‘s trump
card avvay.“

In answer to charges of wasteful and
lraudtilent defense spending. Reagan
said. “Secretar_\ Weinberger should be
praised. not pilloried. for cleaning the
skeletons out olithe closet.” He prom-
ised that those found guilty of swin-
dling the taxpa_vers will be “prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.“

Referring to a more than 5 percent
cut in his budget last year. Reagan said.
“Some are now saying that we need to
chop another $20 billion. $30 billion
or even $50 billion out of national
defense." He called these sorts of
reductions “backsliding of the most ir-
responsible kind.”

In regard to his Strategic Defense In-
itiative, Reagan said, “Isn’t it betterto

Schmidt  

continued from page 1

Schmidt’s discussion of the threat in-
herent to the U.S.’s economic policies
at the same time demonstrated the
danger of budget deficits facing de-
veloping nations. Whereas the U.S.
debt is a product of deficit spending
(“It has a false name in this country,”
Schmidt said, “you call it supply—side
economics. ”), the debts ofdeveloping
nations are, in contrast, largely a pro-
duct of fluctuating oil prices.

Simplifying his analysis again,
Schmidt explained that nations which
import oil had to borrow money when
oil prices rocketed in the 1970‘s,
thereby producing huge deficits. On the
other hand, those countries which are
exporting oil (e.g. Mexico), are facing
a tremendous loss of income in the
future because prices dropped by some
50 percent just this past month. In
either case, these countries must con-
tinue borrowing money from abroad to

 Readathon

winner  
honored

By Susan Felder
For The Pitt News

The auditorium at Falk Elementary
School was filled with excitement
Wednesday when a special assembly took
place.

Former Pittsburgh Steeler Franco Har-
ris presented the school with the $1.000
Pepsi-Cola Library Achievement Award
for being the top winner in the Western
Multiple Sclerosis
Readathon. Harris is the chairman for the
12 counties in Western Pennsylvania.

Falk school raised over $3,000 for MS
by getting people to sponsor them for a
certain amount of money for reading each
book. The students read a total of 1,300
books.

Harris compared the kids to the
Steelers. saying they were both No. 1.
He told them they were winners for help-
ing MS and also because they were in the
program and reading books.

Harris talked about how important he
thinks it is for kids to get involved in ac-
tivities to help people. According to Har-
ris, not only were they helping people.
but the way they did it by reading books
helped open up a whole world for them.

Harris talked about how important
reading is. "Reading helps us throughout
life,“ he said. ‘'It makes things a lot more
interesting.“

Michael Ruscitto.‘ age eight. of Falk
school placed third in the 12 counties in-
volved in the Readathon. He read 155
books in the six—week period.

Ruscitto won a cap, a tote bag and an
AM/FM stereo radio and cassette. He
was also presented with the $1.000 check
to the school.

- School librarian Rose Edmunson said

that the money from the award would go
for books and supplies for the library.

service their debts.

As a result, Schmidt said, these
developing nations are unable to direct
what little money they may otherwise
have to address domestic problems.
Noting the current trend towards
democracy in developing countries
(e. g. the Philippines, Haiti, Argentina),
Schmidt said, “For the man on the
street, if democracy means for him that
he is worse off economically than two
years ago, he might fall for some tough
guy  it is a standing invitation for the
generals to come back in.”

Schmidt’s analysis of the long—term
political implications of current ec-
onomic trends. whether for western
democracies or the nation—states of the
developing world in flux, was sober-
ing to say the least. But the lesson was
perhaps quite simple: “Too long a
period of economic depression." he
said, “leads to a weakening of
democratic stability.”

tions.

Reagan also tirade a brief reference
to the events concerning the recent
Philippine elections. He praised what
he called “the remarkable restraint
shown by both sides to prevent blood-
shed during these last tense days."

"Our hearts and minds are with

ment as they set out to meet the

Altered Art

A great injustice is being done to high school
students in Pittsburgh and across the nation.
Shakespeare and other writers of renown have been
edited, cut, chopped and otherwise butchered by
textbook publishers peddling their wares to our na-
tion’s educators.

But it is not really the textbook publishers who
are to blame. They merely want to sell their prod-
uct, turn a profit and stay aﬂoat on the sea of con-
sumerism. No, as was pointed out in a recent arti-

cle in the Post- Gazette (Jim Gallagher’s “Watered.

Down,” Wed., Feb. 26) we may point a finger at
the statewide book selection committees of Texas
and California. These two states comprise the
largest market for textbooks in America. In order
to appeal to the largest cross-section of the con-
sumer market, textbook publishers must pander to
what may be in these committees a somewhat
puritanical aversion to references to sex and a skit-
tish abhorrence of allusions to the darker side of
American history. The decisions of these commit-
tees, then, will to a large degree determine the
nature and content of textbooks used in public
school classrooms nationwide.

When high school students are being served—up
Shakespeare in a diluted form, when they are be-
ing force—fed distorted or incomplete versions of
history, they are being cheated and manipulated.
We do not protect the virtue and innocence of our
youth by denying them classroom treatment of the
uncensored works of history’s most celebrated and
revered writers. Nor do we do them a favor by
hushing—up the more unsavory, unpleasant aspects
of American political and social history.

It is indeed unfortunate that the unseemly prej-
udice of a group of close-rninded legislators and the
imperatives of the free—market system impose their
taint on unsuspecting pupils in Pennsylvania and
Tennessee, as well as in Texas and California.

 

 

Culture And
The PPC

Your editorial of Feb. 19 ("PPC:
Awash In The Techno—Pop Gutter")
was the very epitome of the Frustrated
Crusader! It seems that you were
grasping for a topic, and PPC was your
target only because, perhaps, you
didn‘t get a seat at the last Sneak
Preview.

The Pitt Program Council consists of
13 committees, including Film, Arts,
Lecture, Art Gallery, Travel, Enter-
tainment and Concerts, to name a few.
You speak of “bourgeois" in reference
to its programming. In your closing
paragraph, you express a wish for some
high art — something other than
“whitebread—bland tedium." It seems
you haven’t really researched the target
of your latest gripes. The Arts Com-
mittee has sponsored the Alvin Ailey
Dance Ensemble. The Film Commit-
tee sponsored a Foreign Film Series on
Sunday evenings. This month, in con-
junction with the Black Action Socie-
ty, CCAC and CMU/Student Ac-
tivities, the PPC Film Committee is
sponsoring an informative film series
focusing on the achievements of black
ﬁgures. The Travel Committee has
sponsored trips to New York and
Canada. In the Art Gallery, located on
the main ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union, local artists’ talents are
showcased weekly. The Lecture Com-

L
COMPANIES

 

mittee has sponsored. besides the
"mindless prattle” of Suzette Charles
(who, by the way, spoke about motiva-
tion to achieve goals, despite the odds).
former President Gerald Ford and Ab-
bey Hoffman & Jerry Rubin. The Stu-
dent Talent Coffeehouse offers talented
students the opportunity to perform.
These events have taken place this year
alone!

Have you ever visited the Art
Gallery? Have you attended any ofthe
Foreign Films or the Black Film
Series? Did you go to New York or are
you going to Toronto? And, if you did
go to New York, was it to visit the
Metropolitan?

If you’d visit the office (M—30
WPU), you could meet the staff. I
guarantee that you’d meet a variety of
people representing a variety of in-
terests and backgrounds. This is not the
sort of crowd who programs for the
bourgeois!

And, as a side note, the Pitt Program
Council probably is one of your best
buyers of ad space. In the month of
February alone, total advertising costs
from PPC were over $1,200.

From your editorial, you sound as if
you are perched right there on the cut-
ting edge, yet you don’t sound as if
you’ve expended much energy to attend
the cultural events that PPC does, in
fact, offer.

Rather than sit in your cubicle and
attack the Pitt Program Council, why
don’t you get to some of the events it
sponsors and critique them after you’ve

“you msseo A spar, suvvx "
Letters to the Editor —-———‘

seen them, rather than complain about
the few snips of information you‘ve
heard in passing‘?

It’s annoying to be preached to by
someone who has probably seen, more
than a couple of tithes. "Porky‘s II.“
Ifyou want to see some high art as well
as pop art, then examine the outlets
PPC offers — don’t just complain about
the first thing you trip on in the
morning!

Philosophy
Of Reason

Dear Kevin Bold:

Thank you for finally writing
something I could read to the end and
see a consistent thought and purpose to
your writing. I felt like I was reading
an excerpt from an Ayn Rand novel
while reading your column “Why I
Like Social Darwinism" (The Pitt
News, Feb. 24). For continually taking
the time to ‘.‘cut down” Ayn Rand, you
sure have expressed the theme in her
novels very eloquently —— even she
would be impressed, I’m sure.

I am curious to know exactly what
aspect of her or her philosophy you do
not agree with, because a reasoning
mind sees no inconsistencies in a
philosophy based purely on reason.

Well, anyway, thanks for the inspir-
ing column.

The Ritual Dissent/

James M. Crary

OK, so we’ve got thisjgreat plot
for a thriller, featuring Wesley
Posvar as the buffoon king and
Roger Benjamin in a ‘harlequin‘s
cap, three ‘bells. 'ﬁ1ey'll-be standing
in the great halls of the Cathedral,
Old’ King Cole on a throne, to be
ﬁimed with a view from the. second
1 floor balcony, while Spiebberg-
. animated bats ﬂoat overhead from
balcony to balcony. Soon all merri-
ment begins to jolt into silence. A
ghastly apparition appears like the
costumed spectre in Poe’s “Masque
of the Red Death”; only the whis-
pers speak not of death, merely of
“reds." The plot tells of the in-
filtration of our mighty American
university by communist scholars
(boom-boom).

The Cray supercomputer is a fine
link between Pitt and CMU, offer-
ing us automated technologies for
blueprinting earthly abundance and
landing those ghastly defense con-
tracts so vital to our economic well-
being. CMU and Pitt have agreed
that Soviet scholars will be for-
bidden access to the computer.'

Games Kids Play

I was a war child. I used to live in a
fantasy world of blood-and—guts gore. I
played war; I played guns; I played kill;
I played fake death — I don’t regret it
either. I was 8 years old. I guess I didn't
understand.

G.I. Joe, with his kung—fu grip for
hand-to—hand combat and his fatigues and
combat boots, was my friend; he was my
tool for imagination. The world of war,
for me, was a fantasy of heroism, causes
and glory. For me and many other boys
as well. My sons will probably think and
do the same thing when they come of age.

I identiﬁed with the glory of battle. For
me, a man in uniform was the only true
man. I wondered why my father and
uncles ever left the service, and why they
never wanted to talk about it. Maybe,
more truthfully, I wondered why they left
as soon as they could, and left it all
behind. I guess I didn’t understand.

“Ask not what your country can do for

you  rang in my young mind as I toted
around my plastic machine gun, killing
everything I saw. My bullets always ﬂew
straight, always hit their targets, always
did what I wanted them to do. In my fan-
tasy world, my gun put me in control,
it let me get my way. I guess I didn't
understand.

At age 9, my friends and I buried a G.I.
Joe who was lost in battle. Actually, we
set him ablaze in an honoring funeral pyre
of gasoline in a hubcap. He was just a
casualty of war — we celebrated brutali-
ty as being “just part of a soldier’s life,
a part of war.” That was our justifica-
tion. I guess we didn’t understand.

At age 10 or 1], I began to question
the things I had always taken on faith.
I began a long, often painful, path of per-
sonal scrutiny. It all began when I heard
about the Vietnam “war.” For as much
sense as the premises of World War II
made to me, the premises of the Vietnam

conflict made no sense at all. For the first
time I questioned the sense behind our
nation’s wars. I can remember seeing
POWs hobbling off Army transport
planes, home at last. I remember the sor-
row and agony on the POWs‘ faces, and
on the faces of the survivors mourning
those who weren‘t lucky enough to be
POWs. I was only about 10 years old,
but I began to wonder about the roman-
tic visions I had always had about war.
Where did this ﬁt in? I didn’t understand.

As I grew a little bit older and con-
tinued thinking about my shattered illu-
sions of the romance of war, I realized
what I had seen. I saw what war really
was — death, fear, pain, stench, noise,
confusion and futility. Futility. I didn’t
quite understand the concept, but it stuck
in my mind like glue. Now I wondered
where the “romance” ﬁt in with the
death.

I realized I had seen people with miss-

ing parts, mental and physical, and realiz-
ed that there is no real justification for
war and killing —- it cannot make sense.
I was embarrassed that human beings
were able to act so brutally and for such
little justification. I was ashamed that my
country had sent its youth to kill a dif-
ferent country's youth. I realized how
perfectly I would have ﬁt the part if I had
been born 15 years earlier. My face
would have been as nameless as those I
saw on TV. I could easily be a pawn for
death. I was starting to understand.

I began to realize why my veteran
relatives and acquaintances didn't talk
about their wars. For many of them. their
wars were still going on. I understand
now the movie scene I once saw of a
father weeping as his son left to ﬁght a
war. He didn’t want him to go; he knew
what his son would see there. He knew
his son might not live to tell about it. He
understood.

Since I began to understand what death
and life are, I haven't been able to
stomach the thought of war and killing.
I also question the concept that dying in
battle is a high honor — it strikes me as
the ultimate waste. Death in war is
unrealized human potential. People are
worth more than being pawns in wars;
people are capable of being peaceful.
This is human potential.

Sure, there are the concepts of “na-
tional security,” “just wars“ and
“counterinsurgency forces," but these
are all so dangerously shortsighted. Kill-
ing is used as a valid means to get what
we want, and that frightens me. It is en-
trenched in our society, but why do we
accept it? What is honor anyway?
Shakespeare asked, in effect, what good
is honor if you’re too dead to enjoy it?
Maybe he knows something we don't.

I used to play war. I guess Ijust didn’t
understand.

Washington Post Writers Group/Richard Cohen

Politics Are Trivializing The Constitution

G. Gordon Liddy’s least favorite air-
port is Dallas-Fort Worth, he tells USA
Today. His favorite airport clubs are
the ones run by American Airlines.

. His favorite book on just ordinary

crime, he tells U.S. News & World
Report, is “The Friends of Eddie
Coyle,” and his recommendation for
a book on special—tactics warfare is
“Crossﬁre.” Got any more questions?

Yes! Who is G. Gordon Liddy’s
favorite columnist? It used to be Jack
Anderson who, according to witnesses,
he once set out to kill. Who is his
favorite psychiatrist? It may be the one
whose office he was convicted of bur-

glarizing. What is his favorite office _

building? It just could be the Watergate
where his burglary team was caught.

You get little hint from either USA
Today or U.S News that Liddy is an
adjudicated and unrepentant criminal.
Neither publication pauses so much as
to say that in furtherance of Richard

ZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDD

Nixon’s re—election and using the cover
of national security, G. Gordon Liddy
did break and enter, burglarize and in
other ways besmirch public office. His
punishment, though, has not necessari-
ly fit his crime. He was sentenced to
52 ‘/2 months in prison and signed to ap-
pear on “Miami Vice.”

What is going on here? It is true, of
course, that Liddy has paid his debt to
society and that he is free, under the
laws he ‘used to ﬂout, to make a living
any way he can. But to USA Today and
U.S. News, he is nothing but a celebri-
ty. When the former published a spe-
cial section on airports, Liddy was just
one of the famous it turned to. O.J.
Simpson loathes O’Hare. Ann Landers
likes it because it means she’s homme.
That’s the way Nancy Kissinger feels
about New York’s John F. Kennedy.
And Dr. Benjamin Spock has a soft
spot in what Liddy would say is his
bleeding heart for the airport in Kan-

sas City. Each and every one of these
people is given a title: sportscaster, col-
umnist, pediatrician, “wife of Henry
Kissinger” and, for Liddy, author.
Yes, author.

Long ago someone observed that
American life is turning into a parody
of a television talk show — a chat with
a nuclear physicist, an actress, a vol-
unteer at a hospice and a Nazi war
criminal. Each gets a mug of coffee
and each gets to call one another by his
or her first name — “What a nice suit,

Fritz.” They are all equally famous,
and fame, after all, is what counts. It
hardly matters anymore how you got
there. What only matters is that you are
famous.

Gordon Liddy is the personification
of that ethic — a barometer of the na-
tion's hypocrisy. Mothers rail against
obscenity in rock lyrics but don’t even
think about Liddy appearing on “Mi-
ami Vice.” The president's guardian

of morality, Edwin Meese III, dep-
utizes a posse to investigate the effects
of pornography on everything from
children to green plants but doesn’t ask
the same kids what lesson they draw
from the life and times of Gordon Lid-
dy. (The only thing sillier than Meese’s
mission is the press asking a president
who once played opposite a monkey
what he thinks of his son appearing on
television in his underwear.)

If Liddy had stolen cash he would
never have been heard of again. We do
not forgive crimes against property.
But crimes against the Constitution are
a different matter. That is politics, and
politics, we obviously think, is some
sort ofjoke. The real joke, though, is
that Liddy himself knew better. For his
politics, he was willing to steal, to
burglarize, to plant recording devices
and, according to witnesses, to kill or
be killed — although that may have
been nothing but talk. At any rate, Lid-
dy’s politics were to rob you ofyours.

A nation needs its Scoundrels if on-
ly to remind it that it stands for
something. Scoundrels personify a
society‘s values — what is permissible,
what is not and what line cannot be
crossed. Liddy, who crossed many of
them, would be tlie perfect scoundrel
— the lawyer with contempt for the
law, the public official who betrays the
public trust, the man who, in his own
little way, made the world worse for
being in it. .

But the demand for celebrities triv-
ializes both the good and the bad — the
baby doctor and the crook from Water-
gate. O.J. Simpson hates O’Hare and
Tony Randall says he can‘t tell one air-
port from another. Singer Dionne War-
wick thinks New Edition may win a
Grammy, author Gordon Liddy has
two crime books to recommend and Idi
Amin, we may presume. has an un-
listed number. He could be an author,
too.

Pre-law society prepares

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Pitt‘s Pre-Law Society is currently
in the process of reorganization. Ac-
cording to newly elected president
Chris Booth, the group, which is com-
prised chieﬂy of liberal arts majors
planning legal careers, hopes to take a
more practical approach in the coming
year.

“We’re going to stress giving pro-
spective law students more  tangible
beneﬁts,” Booth told The Pitt News.

A host of new activities are planned
for the near future, the majority of
which are to prepare students for the
Legal Scholastic Aptitude Test.

workshop sessions," Booth said.
"We‘ve ordered many of the previous-
ly administered exams. In addition,
we’re going to have various sup-
plemental materials. such as Barron‘s
study guides, and we‘ve managed to
acquire professional materials for free
which might cost an individual student
between $3—400."

The Pre-Law Society also hopes to
sponsor a contest for the personal state-
ment component of the standard law
school application. Booth said he plans
to get faculty members from the law
school to judge the entries.

Plans also are underway for a “law
day.” According to the group’s facul-
ty advisor Lee Weinberg, “As many
as 50 or 60 law school representatives”
from around the country are slated to

U.S. government officials fear that

ly formed, U.S.—backed governments

lecture the society on various academic
admissions requirements. Booth said he
hopes to enhance the event by inviting
undergraduates from other schools.
Lest one think otherwise, Booth said,
the Pre-Law Society does more than
prepare undergraduates for law school.
It also tries to give members some idea
of what a legal career is all about.
“We want to find out if being a
lawyer is what we want,” Booth stated.
“We’re trying to attract interesting
speakers. Last year, for example,
Mellon Bank’s vice—president of legal
affairs addressed our group. What’s
more, we’re going to have ﬁeld trips
to live trials and law firms in the city.”
Booth said he hopes to give his
members as much hands—on experience
as possible to be able to secure part-

The Pre-Law Society also en-
courages its members to take advantage
of activities conducted by other depan-
ments. “We’re trying to make our
students more aware oflaw—re1ated1ec-
tures [throughout the university],”
Booth said, “such as those Sponsored
by the history department.”

Recently, first-year Pitt law student
Rob Willis discussed his experiences
with a group of history majors,

Booth pointed out that his club needs
more students if it is to reach its full
potential. “We have to generate
membership,” he said. “That is our
main objective.”

But Palugod said she is certain that
under the Aquino leadership the com-
munist insurgency will disappear.

With Marcos gone, the opposition
members no longer have any reason to
remain outlaws, said Palugod. The
rebel groups, she said, were made up
of more Marcos foes than communists.

"I think they are neutralized now,”
said Palugod. speaking of the in-
surgents. “I think a lot of these peo-
ple will go back to the fold and help

the Aquino administration.”

Palugod says that she is in many
ways overjoyed that the Marcos era has
ended. She is overjoyed for herself, her
country and her family. She also

reiterates that she is happy about the

way the transition of governments was
achieved.

“I am glad President Marcos stepped
down without much bloodshed,” said
Palugod. “We expect him to fight
back. ” ‘

A Heapin’ Helpin’ o’Gastrointestinal Turmoil

By Thomas M. Ferguson

“Whaddayahav, hun?”

Chronic gastritis, actually. Although
it was not offered on any of the menus
I perused, I came away from each of
the three diners I selected for my com-
parative review with a heapin’ helpin’
o’ gastrointestinal turmoil. Don’t try this
on your own, kids. Not even a Pulitzer
would warrant or alleviate the
miserable complications of this “din-
ing” travesty.

I first visited one of the last re-
maining Ivory Towers in the city of
Pittsburgh, in memoriam of the one
that used to stand at the present site
of another fast—food emporium. (This
subsequence is testimony that diners
have given way to fast-food franchises
in the wake of the high-tech
decadence of our civilization — the on-
ly suitable legacy.) At first’g|ance, it
would have been easy to convince
myself that I had stumbled into an out-
post of the Gestapo in a very bad
dream with respect to the relatively
high proportion of biliously uniformed
officers swilling down the bitter dregs
on their free coffee. Honestly, they
should just install feeding troughs for

ly and 2) Don’t eat at the Ivory Tower.
It doesn’t matter what I ate since I very
quickly “unate” it in a convenient
alleyway. I should have left it as a tip,
but I would have had considerable
moral qualms if they featured chunky
soup as the special of the next day —
and I don’t mean Campbell’s.
Critter’s Dinner Diner of scenic East

 

Pittsburgh was the next gastronomical
fiasco on the agenda. Loss of appetite
was inevitable upon initial impact of the
malodorous permeation of searing
flesh, stagnant coffee and clothing
mildew. If the lingering stench didn't
nauseate me, it was the protuberant
grainy wart attatched to the loose bag
of tissue under the sinister eye of the

Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks (1942,

Wicked Waitress of the West. Ever so
stylishly adorned with an inky beehive

  .:y--./eel’ the ‘fruit of  wmts
polyes'ter urii'ierrr; was further s‘-/ic£ence
of a ruthlessly busy shift. It was some
time after the bewitchirig hour, and the
majority of people seemed to have a
spell cast over them, presumably in-
duced by intoxicants, dinerrhea, the
hex of the wart woman or any com-
bination of the above. I got a very scary
image of what might be preparing the
food. Even more frightening was the
spectacle of the zombies devouring

the putrid poison all about me. Old Bet-
ty Boo-fant slung me a “Brahnswag-
ger samwidge,” which I had hoped
would be safe. However, the repug-
nant pronunciation of my order pro-
hibited me from sampling it. If it looked
bad, smelled bad and sounded bad 

Last but hardly least, since there
was no best on our indigestible

  

 

itinerary, we have a quaint little slop
shop way down on Center Avenue
which comes highly recommended for
real down home dyspepsia. I thought
that Irene “Granny” Ryan must have

cornpone and blackeye peas in 
grungy caboose of VeIrna’s Viddies
way down in the east neck of the
woods. The bill of fare did smack
dangerously of Clampett-style cuisine.
Furthermore, the wretched scullion
that briefly reared her ugly head from
behind a stained partition did resem-
ble the dear departed Daisy Moses all
too uncannily. Y’all come back now,
y’heah? Who’s gonna make me? |t’d

have to be Jethro Bodine with a
shotgun at the back of my head.

Decidedly, the anachronistic institu-
tion of the diner is as moribund as its
patrons. Bad food is no toy. An A-
rating on a diner is either the product
of bribery or it is a good reason to
revise the inadequate standards of the
board of health. Shouldn’t the increas-
ed risk of carcinogenesis and arterio-
sclerosis from the concentrated inges-
tion of dirty animal fat be taken into
consideration? Why doesn’t the
Surgeon General require warning
labels on the menu to the effect: “The
main step in preventing hyperlipidemia
in the general population is to change
Western dietary habits, i.e., reducing
fat intake and replacing saturates with
polyunsaturated fats. Yet this
establishment continues to use Iard.”
To the frequent diner food consumer,
I must suggest: Why not just roast
some wienies in the next atomic
mushroom cloud in lieu of prolonged
agony in the future?

In an acute cast of infective or toxic
dinerrhea, treatment involves enforc-

Dancing

By Adam Eisenstat

Like so many other contemporary
entertainers such as Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Mr. T and the herds
of wrestlers who clog the airwaves
these days, 5’5” 250-pound belly
dancer and comedienne Boom Boom
O’Hara has parlayed her bulk into
bucks.

A self-described “middle-aged
housewife from Verona,” Boom Boom
got her big break in March 1982 when
a friend, rock promoter Henry DeLuca,
asked her to dance onstage during the
Coasters’ “Little Egypt.” “The crowd
went hysterical,” says Boom Boom.

“The band stopped playing and the

at a

same thing happened during the sec-
ond show.”

Shortly after the Coasters’ show, a
friend helped her get a job with The
Eastern Onion singing-telegram com-
pany. Boom Boom worked for Eastern
Onion until Dec. 1982 when she was
offered a much higher-paying job with
That Singing Telegram Company. Her
contract with Eastern Onion, however,
stipulated that she could not work un-
til six months after her departure, and
even then it had to be 60 miles outside
of Pittsburgh. Boom Boom sued
Eastern onion and won what she
describes as a landmark decision. “No
one signs contracts like that anymore.

it’s just not worth it.”

Since March 1984 Boom Boom has
been a freelance dancer, taking her
dancing and comedy routine to VFW
and Foreign Legion clubs, bars, par-
ties and offices. Most of the people for
whom Boom Boom does her act for are
men over 50, usually celebrating a
birthday or retirement. Says Boom
Boom, “Fifty-year-olds and up love me
to death. I've done it for 18-year-olds
and graduations; they get so em-
barassed.”

Boom Boom’s standard routine lasts
about 20-25 minutes, “depending on
how responsive‘ the crowd is,” she
said. Dressed in gold lame harem
pants and a revealing gold lame top
with dangling coins and pearls, she
sings a personalized song to the tune
of ‘‘I’m a Yankee Doodle Dandy,”
recites a poem and teaches the retiree,
birthday boy or whoever the “victim”
is, how to belly dance. ‘‘I get paid to
be a smartass,” Boom Boom said
cheerfully. “My routine is always in the
bounds of good taste. it’s not foul, it’s
suggesﬁvef’

Boom Boom is definitely a crowd
pleaser and enjoys her work most
when the crowd enjoys her. “The reac-
tion is the thing. it’s all about participa-
tion. if whoever l’m supposed to be
lampooning has had a beer or ten, he’s
usually pretty cooperative. The trick is
to control the crowd at all times.
Sometimes they try to grab me, but I
never let them touch me.” She hasn’t
had much success with yuppies,
though. Her style of humor and their
lifestyle just don’t seem to mesh.
“Their loud music and videos distract
me. Also, they’re usually too loud and
rude and just plain unresponsive. This
crowd’s just not into what I do. I think
three-piece suits cause brain
damage.”

Boom Boom has performed in a
wide variety of places including the bay
of a gas station and the Liberty Belle
Liner, where she sang what she’
describes as a “filthy” song while
members of the Lincoln Avenue Bap-
tist Church were also present. On
another job she had to “put handcuffs
and a blindfold on some guy and drive
him around town until his party was
transferred to the Edison Hotel.”

Boom Boom’s popularity appears to
be spread throughout the area. Ac-
cording to her husband/manager Art
Cousineau, “We’re very . big in
Carnegie.” Says Boom Boom, ‘‘I did
a Holiday Inn in Uniontown with Suzie
and Sammy’s Nuthouse.” Her most

recent engagement was at the Crystal
Lounge, a country-and-western bar on
the North Side.

Recently Boom Boom was denied a
spot in the St. Patrick’s Day Parade
because, she was told, she would be
too scantily dressed. This really
enrages Boom Boom, whose relatives
have marched i_n the parade for years
with the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
“My grandmother's probably spinning
in her grave ’cause they let the
Shriners in. And they wouldn’t let me
in. The nerve of these people,” huffs
Boom Boom with a heavy sigh.

Even more important to Boom Boom
than her work is God. She was saved
11 years ago and is a devout Christian.
She feels that her talents as an enter-
tainer are God-given and represent, at
least for the time being, God’s wishes.
“This is a job the Lord gave me, to use
every talent I ever had. This is what l’m
supposed to do because I would have
never thought of it myself. It wasn’t an
accident.” Art is also born again.

Boom Boom feels that her work pro-
vides spiritual benefits for the many
people who see her perform. “Lots of
people have gotten saved ‘cause
they’ve seen how happy I am. They’re
drawn to what's inside me.”

But still there are doubts. How can
Boom Boom reconcile her Christiani-
ty with her overwhelmingly worldly,
hedonistically-oriented profession?
“l’m grappling with that now,” she
says earnestly. “l’m grappling with be-
ing a full-time Christian and a full-time
entertainer. But this is how we earn our
living. And we have six kids.

‘‘I would like to find a job where i
don’t have to be half-naked and telling
coarse jokes. I would like to do
something a bit more dignified, more
Christian. l’m very much at the
crossroads of my life. I can’t do this

UFO Aliens Outstay Their Welcome

By Michael Fay

Joe Czolnik was busy finishing up
the.first term of his sophomore year.
He was just minding his own business,
and things in general were looking up
 until they moved in and made his life
a ‘‘living hell.”

They, Czolnik claims, were aliens
from a UFO who camped out in his
Forbes Hall dorm room for over two
weeks.

‘‘I don’t know why they picked on
me,” said the 19-year-old computer
science major who swears he’s never
had a drink in his life. “At first I just
noticed things missing, a Suzy—Q here,
a notebook there, and then I saw
them.”

On Dec. 7 after an evening class,
the unsuspecting undergrad opened
the door to his dorm room only to find
them.

‘‘I couldn’t believe it! There were

these little green guys sitting in a cir- ‘

cle on my bed, reading a stack of let-
ters from my girlfriend back home and
laughing and rolling around. My
drawers were all over the floor! Talk
about no privacy!”

And things didn’t get any better as
young Czolnik tried to get rid of the
aliens. “At first I was mad, and they

"just threw things at me and levitated

me off the ground. Then I tried to be
nice. l’ll tell you, these guys just
wouldn’t quit. I felt like an errand boy
for E.T. I guess they liked me or
something.”

But how do you explain a two-week-
long extraterrestrial blowout? “That
was the problem,” said the bewildered
Czolnik. “No one could see them but
me. How could I explain the dozens of
empty pizza boxes and, oh! the beer
cans everywhere. And everyone knows
 I hate beer! And the girls! I don’t
know how they got them up there, but
they tied me up and made me watch!
It was awfulI”

But that wasn’t the worst of it.

“It got so I was sick of trying to find
excuses. They stole my homework,
they ripped the validation sticker off my
ID and my room was always a mess.
I just couldn’t keep up with them. My
friends thought I was going looney.
One day I went to the cafeteria for din-
ner, and they said I’d already been
there. I. was kicked out for disorderly
conduct!”

Then, after more than two weeks, it
was over.

‘‘It was weird — one day I woke up,

and they were just gone,” Czolnik says
looking reflectively out the window.
“But something is weirder. I miss
them. I don’t know why, I just sort of
do. |’ve stopped going out at night, and
I spend long hours looking out my win-
dowtoward the sky.”

According to many famous psychi-
atrists, Czolnik is going through what
is often called Post-Alien Depression,
a disorder common to humans in-
volved with UFOs. It’ll be a long road
to recovery for young Czolnik, but he
feels confident about the future.

“You have to go on; that’s what I
always say. Right now l’ll go
downstairs and get a Cherry Coke and
a Suzy—Q. Tomorrow, well, who
knows?”

Boom Boom

forever, I’m gonna be 40 next month.
It's a big topic at home. I want to quit
now and stay at home and raise my
kids. I don’t want the isolation of fame,
but we can’t do anything until the Lord
shows us a sign.”

It certainly is a crossroads in Boom
Boom’s life. But until a sign from the
Lord flashes in the window of her life,
this large and soulful woman will con-
tinue to delight those with whom she
comes in contact with her wit, charm
and ever-sunny demeanor.

character Divine, certainly he uses in
his nightclub act with the music. I think
we’ve helped each other.

Matt: Do you think he would have
been a star if you didn’t put him in your
films?

John: At the beginning, Divine didn’t
even take it seriously. I know I did.
Divine thought, “Who’s this guy that
lives down the street?” But, would
Divine have become a star? I don’t
know; maybe, because he had that in
him, certainly, to want to do that. But
I don’t think he would have done it on
his own. He would have had to meet
somebody that said, “Yes, you can do
it  do it, do it, do it” -— and push him
to do it. But if he didn’t meet me
somewhere in his life, he might have
met somebody; because he didn’t like
his life as a normal citizen. He was a
hairdresser. He hated it.

Matt: What were his parents like?
John: His parents are straight. I know
them well. It was sad, because after
the movie came out, they had a huge
falling out. He didn’t see his parents
for eight years. They moved to Florida.
And he started talking to them again
over the phone. They finally said,
“Why don’t you come home and see
us,” and so he did. He was really up-
tight about it. He said, ‘‘I’m not going
to go there’ if they’re going to hassle
me.” And he pulled up in front of the
house, and they had a huge sign say-
ing, “Welcome Home, Divine!” Which
I thought was a very nice story. He gets
along with them very, very well. So it
just goes to show that your parents can
accept anything, if you stick with it long
enough, and work at it, become suc-
cessful at it. Even murderers I know —
they get along with their parents. [He
laughs]

Matt: Morn still loves the youngsters.
John: Yeah, it’s just as they get older,
your parents can accept more. You
can’t get along with your parents if they
support you. I think as soon as you

move away, and that you don’t ask"

them for money, you can get along
much, much better. As long as you can
do your thing the way you want to do
it and don’t drag them into it and are
reasonably happy and not self-
destructive, then, you’ll get along with
them all right. They can learn to accept
everything.

Matt: Was notoriety one of your
reasons for becoming a filmmaker?

: John: I always, when I was a kid, knew

I either wanted to be a mass murderer
or a filmmaker. And I don’t know,

‘ notoriety? It wasn’t the whole reason



I started doing it  to get into the
newspapers. It was like curdling inside
of me. I had to get it out. I went to a
shrink once who said, if I didn’t make
these movies, I’d be in jail. It is the way
to get all that kind of stuff out. But treat
it with humor. 1
Matt: After you saw films by Kenneth
Anger and Andy Warhol, it’s been said
that you felt that you had a chance as
a filmmaker. What aspects of these
directors’ work made you feel that
there could be John Waters films?
John: These films are important to me,
certainly the early Kenneth Anger. But
at the same time, the biggest influence
on me was drive-in movies. Like ex-
ploitation films, like early Russ Meyer,
Herschell Gorden Lewis, bad kinds of
films. I saw them, then I saw the
underground movies and tried to put
them together. A joke on exploitation
films. At the same time,  was going to
see all the early Bergman movies. I just
took little things from" all that, and

 

 

 

hopefully I always had a sense 0
humor that was a little different. In high
school, I never got hassled by
anybody, but I never fit in. So, my
sense of humor was my protection
always. If people thought you were a

little nuts, they left you alone.
Matt: Do you see yourself as an artist
more so than a director?
John: Well, I never use the word ar-
tist. Art is for other people" to decide,
not yourself. I hate it when people say,
‘‘I’m an artist.” I believe that’s up to
the viewer. So, I never say the word
art, unless it’s Mr. Linkletter’s first
name.
Matt: lt’s been said that The National
Enquirer is your favorite tabloid. What

purpose do you think exploitation
serves in America?

John: Well, that’s sort of two ques-
tions. I like the Enquirer because it
makes me laugh. The Enquirer makes

ple buy it every week. People like it.
And, I think it’s creative the way they
do it. And I think most of it is true. I
don’t understand why anybody is mad
when they’re in the Enquirer. To be in
the Enquirer, you really have to be
famous. It is the true barometer of
fame in America. If you’re in the En-
quirer, you’re a household word.
You’re known by everybody. That's
why I think ‘it’s interesting.

Well, exploitation is to most people
— why it is important — is that’s how
they make their living. lt’s like selling
shoes. '

Matt: When Edith Massey died re-
cently, many people mourned her
death. But many people felt that she
was degraded, in that she was an older
lady.

John: Degraded. Well, I wish you
could have asked Edie; they’ve asked
her before. I think her life was much,
much better; I know it was; and I know
what her life was like before; and I
know what it was like being in the
movies. She loved being in the movies.
She loved traveling; she loved the fans
that came to her. She satin her shop.
It made her life much happier. Edie
was no dummy, Edie took it and made
money from it. A

bar.
Matt: I heard she was a madam in a
whorehouse.

John: Years ago she was. She did
everything. But she had sort of a bad
life. Just because an older person is
in a comedy 
degrading. I, think that you laughed
with Edie. Even when Edie was ‘a
damner, and I knew she was dying, I
told her we had the budget for the new
movie, just to try and improve her
spirits. We didn’t, but that didn’t mat-
ter. I know that argument; l’ve heard
it before. I knew Edie; and I knew what
her life was like. She had trouble with
it. '

I don’t think that’s

Matt: Do you consider your films
pornographic?
consider Sylvester
Stallone pornographic.
Matt: Do you mean his early film?
John: No, I mean the new ones. Por-
nography is OK, I’m not for or against
it. lt’s fun when you haven’t seen one
for a long time and want to see it. But
if you watch it every day lt’s like the
old porno, there’s nothing worse than
used porno. [Laughs.]
Matt: Sexual deviance is perhaps the
key to your viewer's fascination.
John: Well, I disagree with that state-
ment. Sexual deviation is, I don’t think,
the key to it. The key to it is humor.
That you can laugh at things that most
people don’t consider funny. And you
feel anxiety about laughing. But when
you’re together as an audience, you
feel safer laughing at the same time 
[laughs]. It’s true that in all of my films
I think sexual deviance is when
you’re unhappy with what you are do-
ing sexually. The villains in my films
are that. The heroes and the heroines
in my films are the ones that may be
sexually deviant, but they are comfor-
table with that.
Matt: Do you base films on your own
expenence?v ~
John: Some, but they’re always very
exaggerated, from the reality of the ex-
periences. But a lot, no; a lot I just read
about or see. I take it from anywhere,

  
   

and then exaggerate it and exaggerate
it. I’m attracted to and repelled by it,

at the same time. Which are all the

things I’m fascinated.by. I think I’m
that.

Matt: What is your philosophy on
media success?

John: I wrote an article on that. lt’s
called “How to be Famous.” lt’s a
joke. Be miserable at the top, and the
public loves you even more. If you’re
going to commit suicide, land on some-
one famous. But I don’t literally recom-
mend that.

By Joe Semanick

Before compiling this guide I was
forced to ask myseIf,“What exactly is
a sleazy bar, anyway?” The term is a
little too condescending and
misleading to accurately describe
Oakland’s many holes-in-the-wall.
Most of the neighborhood dives
reviewed here are working-class bars
that cater to locals — unassuming
shot-in-the-beer joints where you can
sit, talk, play pool and drink cheap
drafts without having to worry about
appearances. Relaxation is probably
their greatest appeal; after the forced
social pageantry of most Oakland night
spots, the blunt casualness of these
bars makes them seem like havens of
sincerity in a world ridden with
affectation.

Unlike most local bars, there is no
atmosphere of trumped-up festivity at
these places. Any entertainment to be

In keeping with this issue ’s
festive “sleaze ‘n’ decadence”
theme, I am perverting the mean-
ing of “singles” to fit its alternate
American pop culture definition:
unmarried adults on the prowl for
mates. Therefore, instead of
reviewing the latest rock ‘n’ roll
45s, I am this week reviewing my
old girlfriends. Names have been
changed to protect the innocent
(or not-so-innocent, as the case
may be).

Betty

The day I met Betty, there was sun
in the sky and pollen in the air. I know
this because I was sneezing uncon-
trollably. Betty’s perfume also made

me sneeze, and the combination of
that andher enchanting leer won my
heart. She wasn’t much to look at, but

had consists of overhearing conversa-
tions, getting dirty looks from other
patrons and eating fish sandwiches
while drunk. A mood of weary con-
geniality or downright meanness
permeates these dank watering holes,
yet many naively adventurous
students, tired of college bars, go to
dives expecting to see vivid local col-
or and raw Americana. They usually
wind up disappointed when they
realize that just because these places
are less superficial, doesn’t make
them any less boring than other bars.
Go to a sleazy bar expecting to find
dirt and decadence and you’ll find
yourself commenting on the decor
(“Gee, those bar stools look like
they’re really from the ’50s.”) and pity-
ing some of the more alcoholic
regulars, even the ones who seem like
they’re sharing a private joke at your
expense (you repressed young middle-
class voyeur). Go there expecting
nostalgia, gruff language and a peek
at unabashed promiscuity and all you
see is a Steeler game on TV and
retired mill hunks talking about the sort
of car they would like to have.
However, if you are one of those
students who is sick of Forbes Avenue

chanced, one day, to step in front of
a truck and be squashed like an over-
ripe grapefuit. A fitting end, but I still
miss her whenever I walk past Mex-
ican restaurants.

Olga

My first Russian conquest. She was
bigger than me, in fact several times
bigger than me, but her maternal
generosity kept me warm through the
cold Siberian nights‘. One day I found
a bottle of pills lying around our cabin,
and when I confronted Olga about it,
she said nervously that they were diet
pills. It was about then that I noticed
the extraordinary amount of curling,
black hair on her forearms. She soon
broke down and told me, through a
flood of tears, that her name was real-
ly Vladimir and that she was, in fact,
a man. I fled from the cabin and,
wandering in the wilderness, was
periodically raped by bears.

night life, and you’re searching for a
place where you can drink beer and
have a good conversation without the
annoyance of loud music and loud
clothing, you might want to visit a few
of these places. I listed them by region
and used a four star rating system: *

iv ~k means all right for a quick one but
not much of anything else; 1: at ~k
means an interesting time can be had
if you try and if you like the people
you’re with; *~k¥k~k means better

Overall, I liked these bars the best.
Probably because it was the first time
I visited most of them (except Chief’s)
and haven’t had the time to grow bored
with them yet. By the way, if you’re not
21, don’t even try going to these bars.
All of them (except Chief’s) carded me.

Though it’s becoming a little more
trendy now (being beneath the Banana
a_nd everything), it’s probably the
closest thing Oakland has to a theme
bar. Opened 40 years ago by a former
fire chief, the bar boasts several fire
trucks, fire hats and other parapher-
nalia plus the Firefighter’s Special:

I knew that I had to end it, because it
was sapping all of my strength and I
kept falling asleep in class. I eventual-

Trixie
Trixie, contrary to what all my friends
think, wasn’t really a prostitute. She
performed what she called “executive
services” in men’s rooms of fancier
restaurants. She never told me exact-
Iy what “executive services” are, but
I’m sure that my Trixie was pure. She
had a cute little habit of demanding
money every time we had sex, and I
would laugh and call her “my little
dumpling,” and she would try to get
money out of my wallet. One time she
pulled a gun on me, and then I thought
maybe she needed a change of
scenery, so I put her on a train to II-
linois to visit her relatives. The last I
heard she had started her own cor-
poration, or rather, “incorporated
herself,” as she put it.

even be able to pick someone up here.
One thing I really liked about this place
is that they sell a lot of things besides
alcohol. Not only do they have Bromo
Seltzer, chips, hot dogs, all major
brands of cigarettes and hard-boiled
«eggs. They also have three condom
machines, more than any other bar
I've ever visited. I bought myself a
French Tickler “direct from Paris” that
has “raised spirals” (to stimulate her)
and a “special shape” (to stimulate
him). When I opened the box, which
said that the product was manufac-

looked like the things that make

Australia last summer, I met a cute lit-
tle Aborigine girl named Goolie. Quite
a gal, that Goolie. She could chuck a
spear through a kangaroo’s head at 50
paces and have it skinned and eaten
before you could say “Knife!” The thing
is, in the Australian outback, when
food runs out and it becomes kiI|-or—be-
killed, a man sometimes has to take
desperate measures. Yes, I’m afraid I
had to barbecue poor little Goolie. She
made quite a nice snack, though, I
must say.

Queen Vixen’s Guide to the Moon and the Stars

The following forecasts of the zodiac
should be read as entertainment, not
fact. These predictions are not based
on scientific data, only ESP.
Resemblances to actual occurrences
are only coincidence; but please write
if your life is also destined by the stars.

— Queen Vixen

Pieces (Feb. 20-March 20) —
Dreams can become nightmares, if
daily deja vu is taken to heart.
Romance will thrive on spontaneity,
but beware when love interest reads
horoscopes as a barometer for your
relationship. Past loves will phone. Tell
them you desire an affair, then pro-
ceed to gloat over current success.
They will see you as enterprising.

Aries (March 21-April 19) — Lunar
cycles are in sync with your biorhythms
today. Others will see you as a model
citizen. Body-building and dieting
regimens finally pay off when an ag-
ing health guru summons your affec-
tion. People will talk, but pay no mind.
Remember: It doesn’t matter what they
say, as long as they're saying
something.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) —
Saturn’s rings are inhaled by 'a black
hole. But,.such is life. When gypsies
come to your. neighborhood ask them
in for a drink and a kindly seance. A
meeting of past and future minds ends
in turmoil, but fear not. The ghost of

Christmas present will intervene and
give peace a chance. When the air is
cleared, the dust will remain. Too bad
you have allergies.

Gemini (May 21-June20) — Batten
down the hatches, you’re going on a
voyage. To where you ask? Don’t. Sur-
prises in life make for intellectual chit-
chat. Keep an eye out for mysterious
people, as they hold that key to en-
viable social security. Religious icons
take on sentimental value. Lend them
to no one, as the glory should be your

 

 

own. Use persuasion like a new toy. It
can offset the winter blues.

Cancer (June 21-July 22) — If the
Milky Way spills and the Big Dipper
doesn’t catch the spoils, you may be
in for a shower of activity. Gussy-up
your appearance. Show off that body.
Trip the life fantastic. Today is the day
you’ve dreamed about. Paparazzi
feign your importance, flowers arrive
without cards and perfumed letters
don’t bring back memories. You will be
the belle of the discotheques, and no

one can stand in your way.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) — Words and
Images are everywhere. They become
an obsession. But refrain from over-
indulgence, the penny you spend may
be your last. Organize schemes that
will create scandalous results. You
have to step on a few toes in order to
get ahead in this world. Take up
photography as a hobby, everyone
loves to have their picture taken. Peo-
ple will flock to your door with smiles
on their faces and forked tongues
wagging about the rumored devices.
Your name will be golden.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) — You are
pure, innocent, slightly coy, at times
modest and lots of fun. At this time,
Virgo-the-Virgin will be in for ex-

hilarating encounters, when Uranus is
harpooned by a crescent moon. Feel-

ings of uncontrollable desire and lust V

will open your mind in existing relation-
ships. Then the bubble will burst.
Overbearing maternal guilt will result
in a return to the faith. A religious call-
ing will become a recurring echo in
your ear. Mental breakdown and
psychological instability rain on your
orgasmic parade. But remain calm,

hysterical tlutterings could land one in
the cuckoo’s nest.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 23) — Your
need for affection dwindles as
business becomes your priority. Slot
machines, roulette tables and strip
poker become profitable ventures.
Money makes the world whirl round
and round. You become dizzy with ex-
citement, as trans-continental flights
cause permanent jet lag. You lose all
sense of time, night becomes day, day-
night, calendars blur. You discover the
secret of eternal youth. As decades roll
on by, you’re heralded with wealth,
happiness and many children. Earth’s
overpopulation will not be your
responsibility. _

Scorpio (Oct. 24-Nov. 22) — The

 

evil eye is on you. Look the doors and
pull down the shades until an eclipse

can punish the offender. Time alone
will spur your hidden talents. Critics
unknowingly pan your efforts, creating
hostility within your domestic environ-
ment. Lovediones will garner unwar-
ranted praise, spurring marriage and
unforeseen difficulties. Maintain secret
fantasies as escapism becomes your
only reality. Your peculiar behavior in-
spires others. But don’t get a swelled
head. Large hat sizes are hard to be
had.

Sagittarius (Nov. 23-Dec. 21) -
Make mountains out of molehills and
thrill your friends. You will become a
fashionable member of society with
your sensational personality. Hordes of
followers buy you every designer crea-
tion. You become bored. You banish
fame and notoriety and decide that

A nudism is the answer. But people‘

catch on, bare butts and boobs
become an international trend. A deci-
sion to escape public eye is futile. You
are an established name- and clothes-

Wear it with pride.

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) — Luck
comes your way as Halley’s comet
enters your astral plane. Gambling and
greyhound races appear promising,
provided that bets are as large as
possible. Keep to yourself as others
may become friendly in order to in-
fringe on your new-found wealth.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 19) —— Long-
range goals prove unobtainable as Vik-
ing ll heads for Neptune. Job security
may be just another passing fancy.
Ugly rumors are reawakened as
skeletons in the closet become ven-
triloquists’ tools. Cry now, friends are
a dime a baker’s dozen. Laughlater,
revenge is the sweetest reward.

Some call them blue movies. Some
call them smut, porn or sleaze.
Whatever term you care to apply to
those X-rated sex romps, one still has
to recognize the fact that porn films are
alive and well. Curiously, the three
films l’ve reviewed here borrow their
stories from other popular films
Heaven Can Wait, Indiana Jones and
The Temple of Doom, and Desperately
Seeking Susan, respectively. And
that’s about all they borrow. So if you
haven't been to a dirty movie lately,
one of the latest offerings may be your
ticket.

l’ll rate the films on a scale of 1 to
5 — five being the film with the most
potential to, uh, excite.

ON GOLDEN BLONDE

Somebody slapped the wrong title
on this one. The story of On Go/den
Blonde does as much for Katharine
Hepburn and picturesque lakes as it
does for an elephant and a shoeshine.
The ;.3:’emE.-:e is bc:‘rc-vi./e-:3 (I use the
.  ii"i.stee.:i from W:ftri'er:
Beat%:y’s czielightfoi l—leaveri  i/ ’ait 
remake of the clasqc Here Comes Mr.
Jordan).

What we have here is a young lady
with huge watermelons (if you catch
my drift) who’s called to heaven before
her time. When she gets there, it’s
realized a mistake has been made,
and the young lady is offered her life
back. But there’s one complication:
she has to enter other women’s
bodies. All of the women she enters
are blonde, thus the title (I’m assum-
ing) On Go/den Blonde.

Aside from a few amusing moments
(one of her sex partners charms her by
admitting: “You’ve got a great vacuum

 

 

   
 

cleaner there” to which she replies,
“Well, you’ve got a great pool
sweeper”), the film fails to ignite many
sparks. Two exceptions are the open-
ing scene and the climax (no pun in-
tended). Both encounters are simple,
one-on-one excursions. But both are
certainly houserockers.

Shame the rest of On Golden Blonde
isn't any more exciting. The cast of
players (headed — again no pun in-

tended - by Jamie Gillis and Ginger
Lynn) seem stale and uninspired. Sup-
porting actors Christy Canyon and
Tom Byron are only slightly more in-
teresting. l have no arguments, but
frankly, I’d rather watch Katharine
Hepburn take her underwear off.

IND/ANA JOAN and THE BLACK HOLE
of MAMMOO

“Hunga, hunga,” cries a native.
“Mamma jamma, mamma jamma,”
says the other. Then they both howl:

“Poomba, poomba, poomba.”

This is undoubtedly the best script
l’ve ever encountered in a porn flick,
simply because it doesn’t for one mo-
ment take itself seriously. lt’s Indiana
Joan and The Black Hole of Mammoo,
of course, with a handful of ship-
wrecked survivors landing on a
deserted island. And, oh how the
natives are restless.

Indiana Joan (played with feverish
style by Barbie Dahl) and Captain Jim
(played by a bearded Michel-e
LeBoeuf) are the leading characters
who must overcome (yes, overcome)
the many sexual adventures they ex-
perience on the island. The pair do
spark some fire, even in the fantasies
(introduced by the slogan: “Lack of
water makes Indiana Joan
hallucinate”).

Indiana Joan boasts better music
than most porn films and makes bet-
ter use of the close-ups (I have to close
my eyes after a while, but hey, gimme
a break, huh?). Supporting girls Hazel
Scott and Satin Summer really seem
to have been eating their vegetables
(among other things) and are in fine
form. As for he rest of the casii, well.
ho-htim.

Director Vince Benedetti had some
good ideas when he shot this film. It’s
too bad that it seems like he only had
two days to do it. There’s definitely
some nice stuff about Indiana Joan,
but the second half of the film really
falls below the level of credibility, ex-

,.citabi|ity or whatever have you. Had it

sustained its momentum from the
beginning, I might have enjoyed it
more. As for the Black Hole of Mam-
moo, well, you just have to see it to
believe it. All I can say is “Hunga,
hungaf’

ONCE UPON A MADONNA

Though Once Upon A Madonna is a
terrible rip-off of Madonna’s film
Desperately Seeking Susan. |t’s also
one of the best porn films l’ve ever
seen. Forget the storyline, forget the
atrocious acting of a cast of porn
regulars (Pattie Petite, Erica Boyer, Lit-
tle Oral Annie and John Leslie), and
forget the fact someone is really trying
to cash in on the Madonna phenome-
na. Sit back, relax, get all hot and
bothered — and enjoy.

Once Upon A Madonna is provoca-
tion from the very beginning. A young
woman, Susan, steals a diamond ear-
ring from her bedmate who has just
been tied and bound. From then on,
everyone is after the ‘diamond,
everyone is after Susan and everyone
ends up sleeping with each other.
What’s so stimulating about the sex-
ual encounters is the sensibility that
these are not actors having sex, but
people having sex. The facial expres-
sions are good, the pacing is fine and
the music is above average.

Director _ﬁ-.da.rn (just simply .’1‘.«:terri}
ltas ta2'i-glad his  into so rha.‘i‘;,/ 
fererzt positions, Once Upon  /tlac;-‘om
ha is completely watchable. The in-
teriors are colorful and though the ac-

tors can’t act, they’re basically healthy-

looking and invigorating. Even when
the sex is stark and simple, Once Upon
A Madonna scores. Take a box of
Kleenex, but not for your nose.

Videos:You

By John Young

Sleaze. Trash’. They've permeated
American life so much as to be con-
sidered a viable part of pop culture.
Turn on your television and flip the dial
to the nearest rock-video channel and
you’ll see what I mean. We've stopped
searching for creativity, enjoying
wallowing in the tawdry, sleazy, hyp-
notic video wasteland. Heaven knows
I have. So let’s stroll down A||-Too-
Recent-Memory Lane and recall some
of our favorite stops.

David Lee Roth/“California Girls” -
Here’s our hero, once more surround-
ed by massive mammaries and luscious
legs. There aren’t any real women in
this video, just svelte, curvaceous
bodies, and lots of ’em. (By the way,
how does Dave find so many women
so eager to be exploited?) There are
some annonyingly ugly people at the
start of this epic, too, who could very
well be Dave's relatives incognito. Mr.
Roth is a class act, and “California
Girls” proves it. I can't wait for his
movie.

‘Heartl“What About Love?” —— Fun-

ny that the Wilson sisters would shed’

their metal-inspired ’70s rock soundfor
some ’80s pop gloss-, then offer up a
video that looks like a 13-year-old male
headbanger’s greatest fantasy come

alive. A post-apocalyptic trash can

drum set, lots of smoke, leather-clad
slave types running about - and of
course, Nancy Wilson in her breast-

’ve Got to See Them to

accentuating bodice. The medieval
S&M motif is legitimized, however, by
proving to be part of a dream Ann is
having on the tour bus. Whewl For a
while there I thought Heart had lost its
credibility.

Eddie Murphy/“Party All The Time”
— No one would have even heard this

 



song had it not been for Eddie Mur-
phy’s profit-assuring name appearing
on it. You can just envision Eddie
laughing to himself as we watch him
whimper away at the mike. There’s

nothing like dollar signs in someone’s .

eyes. to make him seem like a greedy
slob, not unlike you or me. This is
sleaze.
Paul McCartney/“Spies Like Us” -
See above. ~.
Pat Benatar/“Sex As A Weapon” —
Ridicule the use of sex in advertising

by creating a flashy video chock-full of
glimpses of lovely ladies strolling about
suggestively munching hot dogs and
such. Now there’s an irony we can all
sink our teeth into. I think Sheena
Easton beat Pat to this idea with her
sultry posturing during performances
of her feminist ditty “Strut.” Oh well,

no one ever said sleaze had to be
original.
Mick Jagger/“Just Another Night”

—- I like this idea of Mick getting up and-

rocking some sweaty little tropical
nightclub. I like the grainy, hazy
cinematography being employed. I like
Rae Dawn Chong slipping off her coat
and loaning Mick some make-up. But
this steamy bedroom scene with Mick
darting his tongue all across Rae
Dawn's face and neck? I just don’t
know. 

Believe ‘em

Cyndi Lauper/“She Bop” — What
an artful way of only dealing indirectly
with this song’s obvious subject. The
rhythmic movements of the fast-food
customers, the “self-serve” gas sta-
tion, the blind dancers —— subtle in-
deed. Of course, The National Enquirer
doesn’t sell like mad by beating around
the bush — so to speak.

Dead Or Alive/“You Spin Me ‘Round
(Like A Record)” — This is a scary
one. Just as you’re lured into the idea
that the singer’s feminine air is gen-
uine, his butch, nasal voice roars in
and reminds you that this sweet thing
is one very androgynous guy. Watch
out, here /come, he sings. Indeed, look

out for Britain's latest seedy
cross-dresser.
Animotion/“Obsession” — I don’t

think sleaze was ever this much fun.
Asking, Who do you want me to be, to
make you sleep with me?, the band
members appear as spacemen,
Romans, court jesters, pilots and
sheiks. I still think the male singer
looks like Rudolph Hess without dress-
ing up at all. When this group’s
“goodness turns to badness,” the
results are unforgettable.

_ I have toleave this tenth spot open.
Madonna, Prince, heavy metal bands
and Frankie Goes to Hollywood ar
just too easy. -

Happy viewing, America.

By Shaun Martin

While the rest of the nation’s college
students are packing for their Ft.
Lauderdale spring break vacations,
students at the University of Pittsburgh
can only dream of where they would
go. Well, it’s not too long before our
four month summer break, and with a
little money, a dirty mind and a good
sense of humor, you can go to some
of the sleaziest hot spots this world has
to offer. So this summer, tell Mom and
Dad to forget the Grand Canyon! Tell
them you’re spending this summer in:

Las Vegas, Nevada

Here, in this oasis of lust and greed
in a desert of Mormons, gather some
of America’s sleaziest people. After
losing most of your money at the
casino, you may want to watch a‘scan-
tily dressed nightclub showgirl decked
in rhinestones and ostrich feathers.
Have a drink, if you’re over 21, then go
pick up a prostitute — it’s legal here.
For those looking for a one-night stand
without engaging in premarital sex,
you can get married at one of the 12
wedding chapels along the Strip and
get a divorce the next day. Some
useful numbers:

Rape Crisis Center: 735-1111
Gay Switchboard: 733-9990
Gamblers Anonymous: 385-7732

The State of New Jersey

This state, wedged in the middle of
the Bos-Wash Megalopolis, is
Nevada’s eastern counterpart.
Although home to many of the East’s
chemical waste dumps, New Jersey
still remains a great getaway spot. On
a clear day you can see Manhattan
from Newark if you venture outside the

’ cement block airport.

while at the airport, go to any of the

restrooms and get aphone number.
Atlantic City, long a resort for
newlyweds and rich-bitches, is now the
city to gamble your money away in. If
you make it outside the casinos, be
sure to see the breathtaking parking
lots and picturesque alleys lined with
wallowing drunks.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Perhaps the hottest spot in the
hemisphere or even the world. The
hottest section of Rio is Lapa, and here
you can get a transvestite prostitute for

   

or Escardron Squad. Their purpose is
to purge the city of its thieves and drug
addicts. By dawn, bodies line the
streets of this Latin American
playground.

Amsterdam, the Netherlands

All the right stuff! it’s the drug capital
of Europe. Overdose deaths, you say?
They’ve got ‘em. Over 8,000 drug ad-
dicts flock daily to the Zeedijk, or shall
we say Zeefuck, section of town. We’re
in the red-light district now, and you

can find anything. But be careful out _

 
 

 

biggest ghetto. One million blacks
jammed in a slum 10 kilometers from
Johannesburg. The city is off limits to
whites, so not everyone will be able to
experience Soweto. Your best bet for
fun is the Shebeens, the district’s il-
legal bars (blacks are forbidden to sell
alcohol). These bars are hidden in
private living rooms, garages and
backyards. Just look for a crowd of
cars; it’s probably a Shebeen. There
are over 4,000 of them. Try to pick up
a girl and you may be challenged to a
hatchet duel by a stotsi, one of the

By Bitter George

Boy, have I got a bone to pick!
Veneration of sleazeball entertainers is
threatening the very moral fiber of our
glorious nation. Saucy navel-baring
tarts, effeminate makeup—smeared
queers, and foppish hollow-minded
studs whose panacea for the world's
ills is tawdry sexual thrills, have been
flaunting the liberties our permissive
society has allowed them to outra-
geous effect. The time is well nigh to
administer the severe lashing about
the shoulders their depravity has
earned them all!

Look — once, wholesome, un-
blighted entertainment was the fare
Americans delighted in. Hey, the vir-
tue of the likes of Pat Boone and Mr.
Show Biz, Sammy Davis Jr., has never

been in doubt. And the fidelity and
endearing integrity of, such elegant
beauties as Grace Kelly and Katharine
Hepburn were nearly as admirable as
their proper submissiveness to the
men they loved. What has become of
the dash and gallantry so easy to men
like Clark Gable and Cary Grant,
whose gentility was outshone only by
their unmatched chauvinism? All
entertainers a mother would be proud
to call her own!

Lets us respond with all due violence
to the soiled gauntlet of challenge
haughtily hurled by these brazen and
offensive entertainers of the modern
age. I should think that a stern spank-
ing a la “the Duke” John Wayne would
be highly efficacious in curbing that
vixen Madonna's insolence toward
men. Shave off Dee Snider’s offending

locks, slide his greasy torso into
military fatigues and force him to do in-
terminable pushups under the angry
scrutiny of a surly drill sergeant! That
should put a halt to his disrespectful
peeing on America’s highways! In-
carcerate that pampered flamer
Morissey within a small cell with six or
seven particularly large and terrifying
sex-starved Negroes. Several ex-
cruciating weeks would show him the
real meaning of woe.

We must take lessons from the Clint
Eastwood school of social action.
These dandies and courtesans that
serve as an outrage against all prin-
ciples of good taste and decency must
be bludgeoned, cudgeled and other-
wise maimed. Give no quarter  take
no prisoners  purity and honor must
be served!

My Twisted America mum

American values are being gleeful-
ly undermined by covetous bare-
chested men. We must swiftly make
eunuchs of them all, beginning with
such licentious wretches as Richard
Gere, Mel Gibson and William Hurt.
Apollonia and other naked-thighed
hussies are an affront to the integrity
of our proud nation and as such must
be dealt with harshly and in a most
unmerciful manner. Quickly, get them
hence to a nunnery!

We can no longer afford to tarry. It
is essential that we act at once to ex-
orcize our venerable society of these
foul demons of lechery and vice.
Before the assembled might of a
bloodlusting horde of Lee Marvin-
types, these debauched maggots shall
be driven from this, our oasis of
tranquility.

Some Alternatives forYour Drinking Pleasure

because the red light from Chief’s
shines through the block glass win-
dow, giving the place an eerie glow.
Somebody once told me this is a biker
bar. They probably thought this
because they play a lot of '60s music
and about five other people at the bar
were fat and hairy and some wore
leather jackets. They weren’t bikers
though, just big, unattractive regulars.
The Luna wasn’t even that sleazy; they
had pictures of the Pirate baseball
players on the wall and a big clean
men’s room. They also had an elec-
tronic cash register (a dead giveaway).

The bartender said, ‘‘If you want
bikers, go to Joe’s.” So we did.
Joe ’s ir 1: *

There were no bikers here, either,
but there were rednecks wearing
cowboy hats and an old man with a
crew cut and an army jacket who gave
me hostile looks, and a drunk who tried
to pick up my girlfriend. An interesting
thing about Joe’s is that behind the bar
there is a kind of glassless window that
offers a panoramic view of the pool lit:
a room with two pool tables and a juke
box. When I looked down into it, I saw
a Pitt math professor who failed me in
Algebra. He was staggering around
drunk with an awful pig of a girl on his

arm. The guy in the cowboy hat was
winning all of his money from him by
beating him at pool. The men_’s room
wasn’t much more than a crawl space;
it had no mirror and was filthy. I had
a lot of fun at this bar.
SOUTH OAKLAND

All right, I have tobe honest, I didn’t
go deep into the South because I ran
out of time and, more importantly,
money. I only reviewed two bars here.
The S.O.D. Bar ~Av *
Sam and Bernie ’s ‘A’ *1/2

These bars are pretty much inter-
changable because they’re both so
dull. Do not go here if you don’t like
talking to the person that you’re with.

The S.O.D. has funny-looking photos
of the S.O.D. softball team and an
equally funny name. I always thought
that the initials stood for South
Oakland Dive, but I found out they’re
only the initials of the three owners’
surnames. The big difference between
here and Sam and Bernie’s (I some-
times accidentally call it Pat and
Murph’s because the name reminds
me of two Irish kids I knew in high
school) is that Sam and Bernie’s crowd
is younger, uglier and rowdier, and the
place is decorated with some sort of
beer can or cocktail wallpaper from the
early ’60s. Needless to say, the beer
at both places is cheap.

The Pitt News, February 28, 1986

Charles Smith will have outplay Georgetown’s Ralph

Sports

Dalton (52) Saturday if the Panthers are going to
have any hope of defeating the Hoyas for the second

time this season.

Chaz PaIla/ The Pitt “News

 

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

After Pitt’s loss at Boston College
last weekend, Pitt head coach Roy
Chipman stared out at the dark night
from the passenger seat of his car on
the road back to the hotel. Pitt had just
lost its sixth game in its last seven Big
East games. Chipman was thinking of
the better times.

He was thinking of the pre—season
polls which said Pitt would contend for
the Big East Championship this season.
He was thinking about the happy times,
like when Pitt shocked Georgetown
80-76 in the conference opener at a
sold—out Civic Arena earlier in the
season.

But the Georgetown win was way
back in January. It has been a season
of disappointments following the win
over the Hoyas. Pitt has only won five
conference games since then, losing
nine in the process. -

Chipman looked away from the win-
dow, clinched his fists and said,
“Damn, if we canjust put three games
together, we can win the tournament.
We can do it, it’sjust three games. We
just need some confidence.”

Pitt’s confidence got a shot in the
arm Monday when the Earl Kelley—less
Connecticut Huskies came to town. Pitt
romped 79-51.

“I think it was a matter of time
before we were rewarded for our ef-
forts,” said Pitt senior forward Dar-
ryl Shepherd. “Eventually, things were
going to turn our way because we have
so much talent.”

Pitt is hoping the pendulum has made
an about—face. They believe it was on-
ly a matter of time before things went
Pitt’s way. And now it is payback time.

Pitt is out to show the world that they
do indeed deserve to be nationally
ranked, despite their incredibly
mediocre record.

Connecticut was the first for Pitt to
punish, and they are hoping to inflict
the second wound this Saturday when
they play the 22-6 Hoyas in
Georgetown.

It will be no easy task for Pitt to upset

Randy Miller

Georgetown. Especially when you con-
sider Pitt has only beaten Seton Hall
and Lafayette on the road this season.

But the Panthers will go into the
game feeling like they can beat
Georgetown if they play well, not on-
ly if the Hoyas play bad.

Page 19

  Hoya paranoia justified for Pitt

“We’ll feel confident heading into
the Georgetown game,” said
Demetreus Gore. “We have our con-
fidence now.”

If Pitt should beat the Hoyas again,
they will have to contain their one-two
punch of Reggie Williams and David
Wingate.

Williams, a slender 6-7 junior for-
ward, has a deadly jump shot and plays
with a load of intensity. He leads the
Hoyas in scoring at 17.6 points per
game and rebounding at 8.3 a contest.
Wingate, a 6-5 guard/forward,
averages 15.8 points per game. But
when he gets hot, he has the potential
to dominate a game. '

Besides the confidence factor, a Pitt
victory over Georgetown would place
them in a tie with Providence for fifth

continued on page 20

By virtue of Providence’s 69-66
victory over Connecticut on
Wednesday night, it seems that
Pitt’s seeding in the upcoming Big
East Tournament relies entirely on
what the Panthers do this weekend
against Georgetown.

Providence, with the win over
Connecticut, finished the season
with a 7-9 conference record. The
Panthers currently sport a 6-9
record, and should they lose to
Georgetown this Saturday after-
noon, willfinish in sixth place and
will face the Hoyas in the opening
round of the Big East Tournament
on March 6 at Madison Square
Garden. It would mark the third
consecutive year that the Panthers
open the Big East Tournament

Big East seed to be
decided on Saturday

against the same team they faced in
the regular season ﬁnal.

Should Pitt defeat Georgetown
for the second time this season on
Saturday, the Panthers would ﬁnish
with a 7-9 record, identical to Prov-
idence. The Panthers would then be
awarded fifth place by virtue of
wins over Georgetown and
Villanova, two teams in the top four
of the Big East conference stand-
ings. Providence has not defeated
a team in the top four of the Big
East standings.

Pitt would then be paired with
archrival Villanova in the first
round. The Panthers have never ad-
vanced beyond the first round of the
Big East Tournament.

Grapplers get fia hanc at EL

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The focus of collegiate wrestling.
unlike most sports. changes from a
team concept to an individual sport at
season’s end. It’s now the time ofyear
that wrestlers are thinking solely of
themselves.

Wrestlers don’t have the luxury of
leaning on teammates at this point in
the year. It’s tournament time, and only
the winners survive. Rankings can now
be thrown away. It’s up to the in-
dividual to prove how good he really is.

One Panther, Pat Santoro, is ranked
fifth among the nation’s finest
142-pounders. Santoro, though only a
freshman, has kept his national rank-
ing in perspective all year long. “Rank-
ings don’t mean anything,” said San-
toro. “It’s what you do at the end of
the year that counts. How well you do
at the tournament shows how good you
are.

“My goal is to win [at the] EWLS.
Then I want to go to [the] nationals and
show what I can do.”

Santoro is not the only Pitt wrestler
with hopes of going to nationals, nor
is he the only Panther who stands a
good chance of traveling to the NCAAs
March 13-15.

The Panthers‘ coach. Rande Stot
tlemyer. a former threc—timc All-
America himself, knows that it will be
tough. He’s confident that as many as
four or five ofhis men will wrestle well
enough to go to the nationals.

“We wrestle in the nation’s third
toughest conference,” said Stot-
tlemyer, “and quite possibly the second
best. We’re definitely behind the Big
10 only because of Iowa.

“But if our guys wrestle well, and
if they wrestle smart, then we could
send a lot of guys. It will be a tough
thing to do, but anything is possible.”

There are two current Panthers
who’ve made the trip to the nationals
before. Fifth-year senior Doug Haines

made the trip in 1982 as a freshman ‘
U after winning an EWL championship.

earning a wild-card berth following his

~ Jodi O’Neil and Maureen Cleary
will represent Pitt at the Eastern
Swimming Championships this
weekend at Penn State.

O’Neil, a junior from Webster,
N.Y., and Cleary, a freshman from
Rochester, N.Y., will both be
I swimming in the 200-yard breast
stroke with the hope of qualifying
for the NCAA Championships.

At the Big East Championships
last week, O’Neil ﬁnished second
with a time of 2:2l.8l..Cleary
ﬁnished third with a time of
2:27.99, despite being ill. The
qualifying time for the NCAAs is
2:21.29.

“I think it is within reach,” said
O’Neil, whose lifetime best is
2221.6. “I am really psyched for it.
I know that I can go faster and that
I can make it. There is not a lot of

“O’Neil, Cleary
try for NCAAS

pressure on me. I just want to shoot
for it."

While Cleary is shooting for the
ultimate goal of NCAAs, she would
be more than happy qualifying for
senior nationals, for which the
cutoff time is 2:22.49.

“There is always a chance I’ll
qualify for NCAAs,” Cleary said.
“The main reason I am going is
that I was sick during [the] Big East
[Championships], and I still did my
seasonal—best times. Now that I am
healthy, I want to see what I can do.
I don’t have anything to lose.”

With the majority of their team-
mates ﬁnished with the season, the
workload has been light for the
two. The week has consisted of
pace work and loosening drills,
similar to the preparations for the
Big East.

“There is only so much we can
do,” Cleary said. “We have to
keep the feel in the water. We have
to keep a positive attitude and con-
centrate on doing well.”

necessarily guarantee a trip, however.
Just ask Haines. who. like Hnath. also
took third in his weight but was denied
a wild—card berth. Instead, the coaches
selected two wrestlers at the highly
competitive weight class of 134
pounds. To correct last season’s year-
ending disappointment, among other
reasons, Haines opted to return for a
ﬁfth season. The co-captain wanted to
see his career ﬁnish without any doubts
or regrets.

“I’ve had a lot of ups and downs in
my career,” said Haines. “I didn’t
want to leave after last year, looking
back to what could have been.”

Last season still lurks in the back of
Haines’ mind, but the change in the
team’s performance has made a
difference.

“We’ve always had talent,” Haines
remembers. “It just wasn’t exposed
like it has [been] this year. This team
now has conﬁdence.

“I feel better about myself now.
Because of the team’s positive attitude,
I’ve had a better season.”

Unlike Haines, Hnath did go to na-
tionals last season, but it will be a tough
battle to repeat the feat. Hnath is aware

championships at Bloomsburg
University.

“I feel like I’m peaking right now.“
Hnath said. "One thing is for sure —
I don’t want my season or career to end
at Bloomsburg.”

Of all the members on the Panther
wrestling team, Kyle Nellis is the one
who has felt the disappointment of
coming up short for three straight
years. The senior faces the possibility
of ending a remarkable career at the
tourney. Nellis has never gone to the
nationals, despite his being Pitt’s all-
time winning wrestler with 90 career
wins.

Nellis said that he doesn’t want any
regrets when it’s all over. He’s ex-
pressed his wanting to look back with
a smile over what he’s accomplished,
not what could have been. The time to
show that he belongs with the nation’s

_best begins today. His coach knows
that his prize student is capable.

“If Kyle doesn’t worry about going
to the nationals and just goes out and
scores points, he’ll be just fine,” said
Stottlemyer. “Sometimes Kyle puts too
much pressure on himself. He’s beaten
every kid in his weight before, and no

one has ever just dominated him."

If Haines is correct concerning his
feelings about his teammates’ abilities.
then it could be Pitt’s best showing at
the nationals ever. “If everybody
wrestles like they’re capable of, we
could send as many as five guys. Four
guys from our team should go for
sure,” said Haines.

Hnath shares the same feelings as
Haines. “I deﬁnitely say that four guys
should go.”

In wrestling it’s one man against the
other. It doesn’t matter who should go
to the nationals, but rather who earns
the right to go. Beginning today, Pitt
will have to earn that right.

place in the ﬁnal Big East standings.
They would then meet Villanova next
Thursday at 9 p.m. at Madison Square
Garden in the first round. A Pitt-
Villanova matchup would not only in-
sure them of playing a team they match
up well against, but they would face
them with confidence at full steam.

But a loss Saturday would surely
crush the Panthers’ spirits. They would
finish only 6-10 in the Big East, and
they would have to meet Georgetown
in the opening round Thursday at 3
p.m.

Sometimes playing a team you just
lost to is beneﬁcial —— that was the case
last year when Pitt blasted Villanova
to end the regular season, but the
Wildcats got revenge in the first round
of the Big East tournament. But a quick
rematch with Georgetown would not
come to the Panthers aid. Pitt’s con-
fidence would be shattered, while
Georgetown’s would be booming.

In short, Pitt must win Saturday if
it has any aspirations of playing a fac-
tor in the Big East tournament. They
must defeat the Hoyas if they have any
hopes of savoring a long season.

not noticing the car had pulled into the
hotel parking lot.

“I know we can do it,” he mumbles
to no one in particular. “I know we
can.”

Women open tourney with Syracuse

By John Enright
Staff Writer

This afternoon, the Lady Panthers
(11-15 overall and 5-11 in league play)
hope to play the role of spoilers as they
take on the talented Syracuse
Orangewomen in the first round ofthe
Big East Championships at Boston
College.

Pitt, the sixth seed in the tournament,
is a decided underdog against the third-
seed Orangewomen. The Lady Pan-
thers will have to play near—perfect
basketball to pull off an upset.

The two teams met twice in the
regular season, with Syracuse (18—9,
12-4) winning both games‘ easily. In the
first meeting, guard Janice Long and
forward Felisha Legette scored 21
points each as the Orangewomen
prevailed 78-68 on their home court.

Pitt had even more difficulty with
Syracuse at the field house two weeks
ago. The Orangewomenjumped out to
an early lead and never looked back.
as they defeated the Lady Panthers
73-58. Once again, Legette was the
thorn in Pitt’s side, scoring 18 points.

The frightening thought about
Syracuse is the youth they have.
Legette (16.1 points per game) and
Vera Jones (12.8 ppg) are both
sophomores, while guards Janice Long
(11.4 ppg) and Sue Ludwig (12.0 ppg)
are juniors. Legette also leads the squad
in rebounding with 10.1 rebounds per

game.

Senior guards Kim Gannis and Kim
Tirik have been Pitt’s top two per-
formers all season long. Gannis leads
the team in scoring at 14.7 ppg, while
Tirik chips in with 12.8 ppg. Junior
forward Sally Sheerer leads in re-
bounding with 6.3 rpg, while junior
center Jenny Tyner averages 5.6 rpg.
Tirik, the sixth all—time leading scorer

.in Pitt history with 870 points, has 116

assists and 35 steals, and Gannis has
78 assists and 48 steals. Tyner leads the
squad in field goal percentage (55.7
percent), while Sheerer is the Lady
Panthers top free throw shooter at 72.2
percent.

The Pitt—Syracuse game tips off the
tournament today at 1 pm. Villanova
(second seed) plays Connecticut
(seventh), St. John’s (fourth) takes on
host Boston College (fifth), and
regular—season champ Providence
matches up against the winner of last
night’s preliminary game, either Seton
Hall or Georgetown.

The semifinals will be played on
Saturday and the championship game
is slated for Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m.

Wednesday night. Pitt was shut out
at the annual Big East awards banquet.
For the second straight year,
Villanova’s Shelly Pennefather was
named Player—of—the—Year and Seton
Hall‘s Geraldine Saintilus was named
Rookie—of—the—Year.

Providence’s first year coach, Bob
Foley. garnered _ Coach—of—the—Year
honors, while his starting center, Joanie
Powers, won the Big East Scholar-
Athlete award.

IIIC I’ll! IVCWS, Ireoruary A6, 1960 -

By Jim Brueckner

 

A variety of questions for Pittsburgh

0 Who will be the surprise team in
this year‘s NCAA tournament‘? How
about Woonsocket State‘? Or Ben
Franklin Tech‘?

0 Has there ever been a basketball
team that rode the “rollercoaster“ of
success as often as the Panthers‘? Does
anyone realize that I’m not talking
about “up one game, down the next,“
but “up one minute, down the next?”
How can one team look like world
beaters and playground rejects all in
the space of ﬁve minutes?

0 What does this say about lame-
duck coaching? How many of you
agree that Roy Chipman made a titanic
mistake by going public with his in-
tended retirement so early? Wouldn’t
it have been better for all if he had just

V informed those responsible for hiring

his replacement?

0 Was all of that pre—season hoopla
surrounding the Panthers quest for
“big boy” status a little rushed? Do
the Panthers have too little experience
to know how to fully take advantage
of their vast individual abilities?_

0 On the other hand, can anyone ex-
plain how all of these 18- , 19- and
20-year-olds can cope with the pressure
of playing in the NHL? Can you im-
agine how much better the Penguins
will be if they remain intact for two
years? I recall a team on Long Island
that one year had a kid named Trottier,
who was shortly followed by a kid
named Bossy. They’ve kept the two on
the same line for years. Correct me if
I’m wrong, but wasn’t this team (which
kept most of its lines together) rather
successful?

0 What would the Penguins be like
if Mario Lemieux had decided to be-
come a doctor or a baseball player?

0 Why do people confuse the hockey
terms “goon” and “enforcer”? Don’t
they know that a goon is an “initiator,”
and an enforcer is a “retaliator”? If
your enforcer gains a “reputation,”
don’t you think that other teams’ goons
will be less likely to initiate any rough-
housing on your star player? An en-
forcer is a clumsy, untalented, big
player who takes up roster space, right?

0 Does anyone remember ever hear-
ing the name Clark Gillies? Wasn’t he

an all—star left wing for the Islanders
a few years back‘? Wasn‘t he also one
of the most effective enforcers ever‘?

0 ‘Speaking ofeffectiveness. how can
the Spirit possibly be effective when in
many games. 80 percent of the action
is in the Spirits own end of the field‘?
The fact that they score as often as they
do is amazing. but can you imagine
how often they would riddle the oppo-
nent’s net if they could put the pressure
on 80 percent of the time? What does
all of this say about just how good
Spirit goalie David Brcic really is?

0 Just how good are the USFL’s
chances? Does anybody miss the Maul-
ers? Who? Does anybody care? Did
anybody ever really care?

0 Does anybody care that 39 days
from now, I’ll be sitting in centerﬁeld,
in peanut heaven, munching on nachos
and talking about how Josh Gibson
once hit a ball out of Yankee Stadium?
Why couldn’t I have been there?

0 Will the fans be realistic enough
to realize that losing on opening night,
even getting shut out, will not signal
“same old Pirates”? Will they remem-
ber that, should the Pirates lose, it will
be to a kid named Gooden?

0 Will the Pirate fans return to the
ballpark this season to once again sup-
port the team with the second greatest
tradition in baseball history? Hey, was

- Babe Ruth a power hitter?

0 Will Jim Leyland ﬁnally be able to
provide the type of ﬁrm leadership that
the Pirates sorely lacked during the
reign of everybody’s favorite softie,
Chuck Tanner?

0 Will Sid Bream live up to his
phenomenal minor league success?

0 Is Mike Brown a legitimate .330

‘ hitter?
0 How did Joe Orsulak win a batting .

title in winter ball? Was it a fluke? Or
was it that Orsulak corrected a fault in
his swing and will now become a per-
ennial .300 hitter?

0 What if R.J . Reynolds (as I’ve
predicted) turns out to be even better
than his outﬁeld companions? Is he the
best young outﬁelder in all of baseball?

0 If Bream, Brown, Orsulak and
Reynolds are legitimate talents, how far
away can yet another pennant be?

0 Guess what major league team has
the most dominant pitching prospects
in the bush leagues‘? How many peo-
ple are aware that Hawaii has led the
league in ERA the past two seasons‘?

0 If Rick Rhoden wants to get trad-
ed from what will be the most im-
proved team in baseball in 1986 to a
team on the downslide. then why don’t
the Pirates just let him go?

0 Considering all of their young
arms in the minors, do they really need
him? The offer was made, so why don’t

they trade him to the Astros for third «

baseman Denny Walling?

0 If the Pirates don’t trade for some-
one to play the hot corner, shouldn’t
Bill Almon get the nod over Jim
Morrison?

0 How many shortstops are even
.250 hitters? Why do Pirate fans com-
plain about shortstops not hitting? Were
we spoiled by the likes of Arky
Vaughn, Dick Groat and the legendary
Honus Wagner? Are not both Johnnie
LeMaster and Sammy Khalifa in the
upper half of major league shortstops
defensively? Did anyone notice that
most of Khalifa’s errors last season
were caused by over-aggression?

0 Did Tony Pena hit all of those
winter league home runs because he
finally shortened his much-too-long
swing? If he did, is there any doubt that
his bat will return to form this season?

0 Is Johnny Ray the most underrated
Pirate in years? How often can you ﬁnd
all-out hustle, sparkling defense, a con-
sistent .280 average (not bad for 2B),
not to mention the title of “hardest man
to strike out in all of baseball in 1985’ ’?

0 With all of last year’s unfortunate
problems behind them, can the Pirates
return to their yesteryear form? The
“bad element” is gone and the young
talent is there. Is it only a matter of
time and patience?

0 The question is: Is the team “re—
building” or “rebuilt”?

The Pitt News, February 28, 1986

Hopefully, Congemi era has ended

Here in the middle of the cold and
flu season, both of which have struck
me, it‘s time to clear the air and start
anew. But first, we need to clear away
some old business:

Item — John Congemi may be
granted another year of college
eligibility due to an injury he suffered
his freshman year, keeping him on the
bench all that season. Now Pitt’s
quarterback for the past two and a half
years may get that lost season back. It’s

.-\ now in the hands of a committee at

. HEY

NCAA Command. No, please not
another year of Congemi at the helm.
Congemi has proven in some games he
could be a great quarterback — the
1984 Fiesta Bowl and the 1984 Penn
State game are the best examples of
what Congemi can do when he is on.
But games like those are the exception
rather than the rule.

Pitt is a shoddy 8-12-2 with Congemi
at the helm. A team has to have either
a great quarterback or one with less
talent who can win. One with great
talent is of course preferred —- Dan
Marino and Steve Young were quarter-
backs who couldn’t lose in college if
they didn’t have arms. Nevertheless,
a quarterback whose greatest asset is
the mysterious ability to win can lead
a team to great heights. Doug Flutie
and John Schaeffer are quarterbacks
who could win without a great deal of
pure skill. The point is, Congemi is not
a winner. It is time for Pitt football to
start over. The quarterback position is
the most important on the team, and
Pitt needs somebody there who can
win. If it turns out Pitt has nobody bet-
ter than Congemi, we could be in for
another long fall.

Item — Pitt’s basketball team needs
to win tomorrow at Georgetown to
clinch fifth place in the Big East and
meet Villanova in the first round of the
Big East tournament. It ain’t gonna
happen. Pitt has nothing left this
season. It took an inspired effort and
17,000 Pitt fans to beat Georgetown

Bob Travers

here in January. The Panthers are far
past the point of inspiration this season.
They’ll play flat and get beat tomor-
row. Providence, if Pitt does lose, will
finish ﬁfth and get the Wildcats in the
tourney. Pitt, the sixth-place ﬁnisher,
will play Georgetown in round one. Pitt
will lose that game and get passed over
by the NCAA Tournament Selection
Committee (or whatever the guys who
pick the tournament teams are called),
then the Panthers will accept a bid to
play in the NIT and will beat Indiana
in the tournament championship. When
the above comes to pass, remember
where you heard it first.

Item — The Pitt men’s and women’s
swim teams won their fourth con-
secutive Big East championships last
weekend. We have a dynasty here,
folks. These are the most underrated
athletic teams in Pittsburgh and have
been Pitt’s most successful teams over
the past few years. If the football or
basketball team was this successful.
we’d be so sick of hearing about them
even Penn State fans would seem
modest. As it is, nothing is ever writ-
ten (besides in these pages) about these

eminently successful programs. Pitt has
a burgeoning empire in Trees Pool, and
nobody seems to be noticing.
Item —— The USFL’s anti—trust suit
against the NFL is slated to come up
for trial next month.
The USFL is asking for billions of
dollars in lost revenue because, they
claim, the NFL holds an illegal
monopoly over the three major televi-
sion networks. The USFL is planning
on playing a fall schedule in 1986,
directly competing with the NFL for
the first time. Not suprisingly, the
newer league has found no network
takers on its television rights. USFL at-
torneys claim the networks have told
the league there is no room for two pro
football leagues on the same network.
Whether it’s legally right is yet to be
determined, but the USFL’s theory
makes no business sense. What the
USFL wants is for each NFL team to
bargain individually with networks,
rather than as a whole league. The
USFL thinks its teams will then be able
to compete on an even keel with NFL
teams when it comes to bidding for
television rights. No way. No network,
television station or shortwave radio
station would ever pick a USFL team
over an NFL team. Even if the USFL
teams could get network time, no net-
work would put them on. The USFL
will have franchises in only eight cities.
Beyond those cities, nobody at all cares
about the league, and even in those
cities, interest is extremely limited. The
USFL is a ratings graveyard. Nobody
watches the league, and nobody cares
about the league. The fact that it’s on
TV will not alter this one little bit. Peo-
ple will just change the station.
