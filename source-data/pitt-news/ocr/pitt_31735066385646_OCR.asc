UNIVERSITY OF PI'lTSBGH

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Two days after Governor
Robert Casey released a tentative
state -budget that could throw

Pitt into a $10 million deﬁcit,‘

Pitt’s Board of Trustees
announced its full support of
President Wesley Posvar’s
decision to implement a hiring
freeze.

“While all of us regret very
much the circumstances which
have led to this situation over
which the university really has
little control, we regard the
president’s decision to be within
his authority and it is reasonable,

responsible, and I think somewhat
courageous and appropriate, in
order to sustain the financial
capability of the university and
the quality of its programs,” said
John C. Marous, board chairman;
,5, A letter signed by 29 chairmen
and program directors of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences was

presented to the trustees at

Friday’s board meeting. The letter
was the result of a meeting ‘among
chairmen last week where those
FAS leaders gave President Posvar
a vote of no confidence. Trustee
C. Holmes Wolfe, chairman of
the board’s academic affairs
committee, said that the hiring
freeze was just one complaint

perceived to be the ignoring of
legitimate grievances relating to
such matters as lack of personnel,
lack of space, lack of
communication and lack of
response to complaints,” he said

Marous said that the Board of
Trustees would respond to the
FAS letter.

“I can well understand the
concerns that the representatives
of the FAS have expressed
concerning the president’s
decision to suspend hiring,” he
said. “The concerns expressed
by the FAS chairman  clearly
warrant further serious
considerations.”

Marous said that the
administration needs to
communicate with the FAS
chairmen.

“On behalf of this ‘board, I
would like to request that the
president, in consultation with
trustees, work with the chairman
of the academic affairs committee,
provost Henderson and Dean

Koehler to extend meaningful
dialogue with FAS leaders and
representatives to address their
concerns and to effectively
improve mechanisms for
communications, and the results
should be reported back to the
trustees,” he said.

Marous said that the letter does

not change the board’s support

of President Posvar.
“The president made this
decision at a time to position the

university to deal responsibly with '

university faces in respect to state

funding and tuition revenues,”

he said. “I think it is important at

homeless crisis

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

Twenty years ago, America's homeless tended
primarily to be Irish Catholic males with drinking
problems; however, the status has since spread to
include women and other groups, according to
State Senator Michael Dawida.

Today, Dawida said, a large portion of our

country's homeless population is comprised of
single women and those whose children accompany
them “on the streets.” The number of these women,
he said, is steadily growing.

Concerned mainly about what the states and
local communities are doing about the homelessness
problem, Dawida, who spoke at Pitt on Friday, sees
little concern all around.

“It is an issue that everybody should be concerned
with. Obviously they’re not, but they deﬁnitely
should be,” he said.

Failure of the country’s social—service safety net
has become the reason -for the homelessness
problem, according to the senator.

“There will always be homelessness. We will
never find a society [that] can meet everyone’s
needs,” he added. ’

He sees the overall majority of homeless people
as being women, persons with various types of
mental illnesses and persons with chemical
dependencies.

The federal government, according to Dawida,
generally agrees to spend some money on shelters
for the homeless. In addition to this commitment,
even. if the states cannot match the resources of the

 

federal government, our society must get involved,

Pitt energy
center opens  

By Jacinta Marie Dvorak
Staff Writer

Combining energy research with a
concern for environmental issues, the

School of Engineering at the University of
Pittsburgh has established a research center ,

to meet the county’s growing energy needs
and environmental concerns.

The project is being directed by Professor
Shiao-Hung Chiang, the Ernest Roth
professor of chemical engineering at“Pitt.
The research conducted at the center will
be concerned primarily with energy from
coal. “Oil and gas may only last  30 to

40 [more] years. At the present usage, we «

can expect coal to last several hundreds of
years,” said Chiang. J

“Acid rain is a very big issue today,”
Chiang said. “We are trying to look into
new knowledge and production of energy
that can solve this problem.”

Currently, Westinghouse is working with
Pitt on a program to reduce pyritic sulfur,

a byproduct of coal combustion. Once this ~

sulfur is taken away, acid rain could be
reduced by up to 90 percent. This method

of cleaning coal also reduces the costs of —

deep-cleaning processes and shipping.
The Center of Energy Research will also
sponsor the Seventh Annual International
Pittsburgh Coal Conference in September.
The latest research and development and
commercialization of coal will be presented
at the conference. In 1989, the conference

YMCA volunteers to experience a blue (grass) spring brea/e

By Jennifer Shusko
For The Pitt News

When Doug Bajack joined the YMCA as
a freshman, he probably didn’t think he
would be spending his spring break in the
Appalachian Mountains.

One might ask, what does the YMCA
have to do with a Pitt student spending
spring break learning about life in the
Appalachians? Most people think of the
YMCA as a public place to go swimming
and to work out in the gym.

The gym is just one part of the YMCA.
What many people are not aware of is that
there is a Collegiate YMCA that sponsors
volunteer services and projects such as the
alternative spring break trip to Kentucky.

Students of all majors volunteer at least
one to three hours per week. The students
spend time working in one or more of the
15 programs ‘that the YMCA sponsors.
Volunteer work consists of providing
companionship for elderly patients and
escorting residents of a female— offenders
center to Alcoholics and Narcotics

Anonymous meetings. The YMCA also
has a buddy system with the Shuman
Juvenile Facility which matches‘ each boy
with a volunteer.

“The idea of the buddy system is to
provide someone for the kids to talk to
and provide a positive role model,” said
Nancy Wells, executive director of the
YMCA. _

Bajack, now a senior and the YMCA’s
special-prograrns coordinator, organized
the alternative spring—break trip to the
Appalachian Mountains in Kentucky.

According to Bajack, the trip is designed
to give college students the opportunity to
experience the culture and meet the people
of that region.

The group of students will help with
farm work and building and repairing
homes, In addition, they will visit homes
of local people, community centers and
nursing homes.

“The response of volunteers was
overwhelming. We had 50 responses but
only 20 slots to ﬁll,” said Keith Kondrich,

Continued from page 1
he said.

“This is an era of Reaganism,”
said Dawida. “This is an era [in
which] government is not
supposed to be involved.”

Although Dawida admitted that
the issue of homelessness had
not previously been a top priority,
recently he has placed it very
near the top of his list.

“We’re obviously not meeting
the extensive need, but we are
the only ones even talking about
solving the problem [of
homelessnessl,” said Dawida.

The city, according to Dawida,
has developed a program named
Bridge Housing that includes
shelters for women who had been

abused by their spouses or are .

battling chemical dependency.
They are mostly for those with
dependents and provide

counseling and health care. One
facility is located in Braddock,
one of Dawida’s districts.

“IWe are attempting] to take
someone who has nowhere to
turn and find some way for them
to become independent,” Dawida
said.

Although Dawida sees his
efforts as modest, he feels they
are doing some good. Although
his ideas are simple, many other
places around the country are
not following his example.

There are approximately 2,000
homeless people in Pittsburgh
and a quarter million in the state
of Pennsylvania.

“IThel government sometimes
takes very long to discover the
obvious,” said Dawida.

The senator is also attempting
to rebuild single—room living
occupancies, which are available

Here, people can live without
intrusion from the government.
“It’s fairly simple, but it’s also
something that got lost in urban
renewal,” he said.

Today, those with mental
illnesses comprise 20 to 30 percent
of the homeless. According to
Dawida, 15 years ago the
government decided these people
would excel better in minimally
restrictive environments.

“Instead of throwing people in
institutions and [forcing] them to
stay there the rest of their lives,
we have tried to offer an
alternative,” Dawida said.

f‘A couple of days of living in
the street and [a person] will not
be the same,” said Dawida. “It is
definitely a cause of abhorrent
mental disease.”

In his Senate Bill 701, Dawida
makes a modest attempt to
increase those on welfare and
develop mental—hea1th case
workers for the homeless. His bill
is worth $11 million. “I think it is
worth $100 million to the
homeless,” he said.

We are trying to get people
from a dependent to an
independent state,” Dawida said.
“Sheltering is an expensive way
to do it. It’s easier to treat
individual problems.”

He believes that a myth of
“welfare careerists” exists, in that
society believes people on welfare
got themselves there on purpose.

“We still have reservation in
our hearts that the needy are
worthy of our concern and
support, no matter how hard-
hearted society has become,” said
Dawida.

this time that the board go on
record in expressing both its
confidence in President Posvar
and its support for his recent
decision. We should also support
his presentand future efforts to

improve the climate for additional ~

financial support for
university in Harrisburg.”

Holmes said that the university’s
provost also endorsed Posvar’s
decision. a

“Dr. Henderson has said that
he felt the hiring freeze was a
reasonable step and one that he
had warned the deans about on
numerous occasions. Since
present indications are that
university-wide enrollment
projections are down, Dr.
Henderson is not expecting an
increase in income or at least not
in tuition income and hard

this

decisions are going to have to be
made such as the hiring freeze,"
he said.

The trustees were informed in
advance of Posvar’s decision,
according to Marous.

“The president shared with us
the reasons for his decision. It is
our understanding that this is
really not a freeze, it is a temporary
freeze, and that exceptions will
be made when they can be
justiﬁed in terms of institutional
priorities and other relevant
cdnsiderations,” he said.

The board then passed a
resolution to officially
acknowledge their support of
Posvar which stated, “This board
affirms its confidence in the
leadership in the administration
of Posvar and we endorse his
decision for fiscalzprudence in
requiring a restriction on faculty

hiring.”

Posvar thanked the board for
their support and said that he
expected the criticisms he is

receiving.
_“When I took this action I
expected criticism, but

nonetheless it has been a very
difficult personal experience for
me,” he said. “There are
grievances and they are centered
in the FAS;’that is, in my own
terms, the flagship of the
university.”

“There are problems that are
real and there are problems that
are perceived and wewant to
separate that gap.”

Later in the meeting, during his
budgetary report, Posvar
explained the implications of the
recently released state budget.
Posvar said that a four percent
increase in state appropriations
would bring in $4.5 million and a
four percent tuition cap would
bring an additional $ 5 million in

revenue.

He said that the university has
mandated $18 million in various
increases including T .A. salaries,
fringe benefits, insurance, utilities
and minimum renovations.

“Given those very simple
elements, we’ll have a gap of
about $10 million right up front
to begin with,” he said.

Posvar said the university would
work very hard in Harrisburg to
get some relief.

“We will achieve whatever
remedies we can. We will delay
maintenance and renovations. We
will make reallocations,” he said.

Posvar said that the hiring freeze

would protect current faculty and‘

staff members from enduring
hardships.
“The reason of course that we

‘had to go after personnel costs

immediately is because this is the
only way to control costs in the
coming year and personnel costs
are 80 percent of our budget. We

Posvar said that the hiring freeze

on the general quality of a

“I would hope that it would be

Closing the University Sloop

The University of Pittsburgh is forcing the end of an
era in its decision to close the University Shop on
Forbes Avenue. The 28-year-old shop, which will be
closed by May, sells Pitt paraphernalia and boasts
autographs on its walls of famous Pitt personalities
dating back to 1965.

The lease on the shop, held by the university, will
not be renewed.

The owner of the shop, Jay McKenzie, feels that Pitt
is making a grave mistake in its decision because of
the historical and traditional value of the shop. McK-
enzie said that he is receiving phone calls from all over
the country. He mentioned one man who visits two
places when he returns for every homecoming: The
“O” to get a hot dog and the University Shop to buy
a shirt. A 

The university is going to replace the shop with a
similar one of its own. Accordingly, citing reasons for
not renewing the shop’s lease, vice president for
administration, John Yeager, stated that “the univer-
sity is mounting a significant new licensing program”
involving items sporting the Pitt logo. Noting that the
choice was inﬂuenced by a lack of a better location,
he said, “The bookstore doesn’t have enough room, so
we have to look for another location.” Yeager claims
that the University Shop provides an ideal, temporary
solution to the space problem. '

Of course, the university is legally justified in taking _

over the University Shop property. After all, it owns
the shop.

But it may be possible that the move was sparked by
the recent concern by the university over its budgetary
problems, namely the speculated deficit — conse-
quently signaling Pitt’s awareness and vulnerability in
financial matters: University ownership of the shop
could bring in needed revenue, thus aiding its future
economic interests, which is always a good sign.

Yet one might be more understanding of the univer-
sity’s decision on this matter if it was going to replace
the shop with dormitories or some other type of
needed university facility. But it’s not. -

We must wonder: is the added revenue for the
university really worth ruining a tradition? But then,
we must also ask: will the university actually be
ruining a tradition? If it keeps the intangibles that have
made the store traditional, such as the autographs,
then it really would not be doing so. The current
owner, however, has decided that when he goes, the
autographs go. _

The ultimate loser in this whole affair is the store
owner, McKenzie, who probably will not be able to
afford to relocate the shop. The university should be
more sympathetic to the interests of the srnall-busi-
ness man. However, in the cut-throat world of busi-
ness, the necessities and realities of financial interests
often, and unfortunately, dictate.

Depression can strike anybody

Suppose that one day after break-
fast, you are seized with a sudden,
terrible stomachache. You down
some Pepto Bismol, assuming it was

. something you ate and forget about

it.

But three days later, you are af-
fected by the same pain. And four
weeks later, you finish off your sec-
ond large bottle of Maalox Plusand
decide that it’s time to see a doctor.

The doctor sends you to the hospi-
tal for some tests, and the next thing
you know, you are packing your
bags for a four—week stay there. You
need an operation.

Naturally, your family and friends
feel bad for you. They visit almost

(every day and send you flowers and
/ stuff. Your teachers send you ma-

keup work so you can keep up with
some of your classes.

The sequence of events that I have
just described is one that happens
every day. When people are sick,
they go to the doctor. When people
are really sick, they spend time in a
hospital.

Suppose, however, that instead of
getting a stomachache one morning,
you got real depressed. And suppose
that for four weeks you were de-
pressed almost every day.

Would you go to see a psycholo-
gist?

And if that psychologist told you
that you needed to check into West-
ern Psychiatric Institute & Clinic for
three or four weeks (the average
length of stay), would you pack your
bags and go?

How would your family react?
Would you tell your friends? Would
your teachers understand?

Major depression is a sadly misun-
derstood illness. The people I spent
time with as a volunteer on the 13th
floor of Western Psych last term will
tell you that.

A 36-year-old eastern Pennsylva-
nia businessman, with two daugh-
ters, told me one afternoon that “I
had to tell my family and my boss
that I was leaving for a while. I told
them not to tell anyone else where I
was going because I didn’t think
they’d understand. I had to explain
to them I was thinking about com-
mitting suicide so they’d know I was
serious. Now I’m afraid they think

I’m psycho.”

Two 30-year-old nurses agree,
“You just don't want to answer
the phone. You don't have the
energy. Your friends try to get
you to go out and ‘have a good
time,’ but you can’t enjoy your-
self. You can’t play some upbeat

 

    Jodi
Polaha

music, take a hot sho er and
snap out of it  it’s just not like
that.”  j

A college student admits, “You
wake up feeling miserable, and
you go to bed crying. Your friends
get sick of you because you're
always complaining. You don't
care what you look like or how
much you eat. Your mother keeps
telling you that if you'd get dressed
up and do something prodGc-
tive, you'd feel better. But even
when you find the energy to do
all of that, you still feel like curl-
ing up in front of the television
with a family-sized bag of Wild-
n-Mild Fritos.”

The fact is, major depression is
not like the depression you have
when you fail a calculus test or
break up with your girlfriend.

1 Major depression is an illness,

like a stomach ulcer is an illness.
If left untreated, both may result
in death. The only unfortunate
difference is that the cause of a
stomach ulcer is obvious and
tangible, while the cause of major
depression is sometimes inher-
ited and genetic and is other
times unknown. Research on the
treatment of this kind of depres-
sion is also inconclusive, even

though certain drugs combined
with certain kinds of therapy have
been found to have some effect.

While many easily consider a
disorder such as schizophrenia

an illness because of its extreme ’

and severely disabling nature,
many have difficulty considering

. some cases of depression as ill-

nesses. Why? Because everyone
has gotten over feeling-sad at
one time or another. They there-
fore assume that everyone else
should be able to “get over it.”
But that is not the case for people
who have some kinds of depres-
sion.

These people are not only
hairdressers, housewives and
senior citizens. They are profes-
sional businessmen with farni-

. lies. (Abraham Lincoln is believed

to have suffered from major
depression.) They are people
with lots of money, friends and
even fame (Marilyn Monroe); they
are even students in college. No,
depression is not a selective ill-
ness: it will affect four in 10
women and one in 10 men in the
United States.‘

Psychology and the study and
treatment of mental illness ‘are
fairly new in comparison to biol-
ogy and the study and treatment
of physical illness. However,
enough is known about depres-
sion to be able to sort a simple
sadness over a bad day from a
difficult adjustment after the loss
of a loved one; from a recurring
milder depression (known as
dysthymia); from a serious disor-
der such as major depression,
which may result in suicide.

We need to recognize depres-
sion, not as a flaw of lower-class
individuals or of people with
weaker personalities, but as an
illness just like a stomach ulcer,
heart failure or cancer.

Our acceptance of depression
in this way can help those af-

fected with the disorder a great

deal. It can help them feel conﬁ-
dent enough to seek help. It can
even save lives.

Shorter sets new record as Pitt beats Providence

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Brian Shorter was literally unstoppable on Saturday.

He set a new Big East record by going a perfect 11 for 11 from the
field in Pitt’s 117-102 victory over the Providence Friars in front of a
sold-out crowd of 6,798 in Fitzgerald Field House. The Panthers’ 117
points were the most ever scored in a Big East contest. Shorter’s 11-
11 shooting was only two shy of the NCAA record for game field—goal
percentage.

. “I was beating them to the spots, and Darelle [Porter] was looking
around real well and spotting me,” said Shorter, who also hit 12 of
17 free throws to give him 34 points for the night. “I don’t know if their
coach told them to play behind me or what.”

That wasn’t the case. “We didn’t want to play behind him; obviously
it looked like that was what we were doing, but we wanted to ﬁght
him for position,” said Friar Coach Rick Barnes. “He’s going to get his
points, but I think he overdid it a bit tonight.”

Shorter added eight rebounds, five assists, three blocks and two

’ Panther guards  gaiards. 
   I SeeP“ge10        

steals.

Actually the entire Panther team was hot. They shot 66 percent from
the field, 80 percent from the foul line and 83 percent from three-
point territory. Pitt shooting guard Jason Matthews hit two three
pointers en route to a 25-point night. Rod Brookin was two for two
from long distance and ended with 14 points.

If Shorter hadn’t had such an explosive night, Porter would have
been the player of the game. He scored 16 points, grabbed seven
rebounds and dished out 12 assists. Porter is the Big East leader in
assists and moved into second place on Pitt’s all-time assist list. He
now has 387 career assists. Porter is now only 23 assists away from
breaking the Panthers single—season record.

Most of Porter’s damage was done while penetrating to the hoop
against the Providence defense and then laying in an acrobatic shot
or dishing the ball off to Shorter or Bobby Martin.

“He was working on [penetrating] over the summer and putting
pressure on the defense,” said Matthews. “He’s not just setting up the
offense every time.” 1

Providence grabbed an early 2-0 lead on Quinton Burton’s inside
move, but Shorter quickly converted a three—point play, and Pitt never
relinquished the lead. The lead ﬂuctuated between one and 15 points

Swervm’ Curvin to bead for the base pat/as tbis Sprmg

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

1990 Heisman Trophy
candidate Curvin Richards has
decided that he will go about
things a little differently this
spring. He is not going to play
spring football; rather, he is going
to take a crack at the pitchers of
the Big East. Richards has decided
to play baseball for the Pitt
Panthers, and his potential looks
good.

Pitt baseball coach Bobby Lewis

said, “lRichards’] high school
coach told me he feels that Curvin
has the ability to play Division I
baseball. He can hit and ﬁeld
well, and we all know he can
run.”

Richards, who will be a junior
in the upcoming football season,
has been the starting tailback for
the Panthers’ football team since
the third game of his freshman
year. He has had two consecutive
1,000—yard seasons rushing, and
he and teammate Alex Van Pelt
have been listed in the Sporting

News as possible Heisman Trophy
candidates for next season.

Richards said, “I decided to
play baseball this year mainly
because I missed it last year. I
have already told [Panther head
football coach Paul] Hackett that
I’m going to miss spring ball
because of baseball.”

“[The football staff] has seen
him the last two seasons and last
spring. They know what he can
do,” said Lewis, who has been
the baseball coach at Pitt since
1955. “When Coach Hackett

returns from his recruiting trips,
we’ll get together to talk about it.
I foresee no problem.”

Hackett was unable to be
reached for comment.

At LaPorte High School in
LaPorte, Texas, Richards was
named to All-District four times.
During his senior year, he hit .429
while playing center field.

“I really don’t know where I’m
going to play on this team. We
have only practiced inside lat
Fitzgerald Field Housel,” said
Richards.

“He has an excellent chance of
being a starter in the outfield,”
said Lewis. “From what we have
seen in the indoor practice
sessions, he has a strong arm and
what looks to be a good swing.

“Once we get outside, we’ll be
able to tell a lot more about the
whole team. As of right now, we
may go with a platoon system,
but I really can’t say for sure.”

Richards is a right—handed hitter.
He said, “I just look to hit the ball
hard and to go with the way it’s

Right Guards...

Pitt guards able to contain Providence's Screen, Murdock

By Scot Ross
Managing Editor

Brian Shorter is Pitt’s leader.
When he scores, Pitt wins. How
his scoring opportunities are
created though, in many parts,
comes back to the play of Pitt’s
guards. Against the strong
backcourt of Eric Murdock and
Carlton Screen, Darelle Porter and
Jason Matthews were able to take
the game to Providence,
penetrating in the paint and
allowing Shorter to score.

“Darel1e’s looking to get the
assists,” said Shorter, who
gathered 34 points, including a
new Big East record of 11 of 11

from the ﬂoor. “It’s his first priority.
He’s just looking and it happens.”

With the effort of Pitt’s guards,
Providence was therefore without
an inside game, reflective of their
42- percent shooting from the
field. “I think our triangle and
two [guards] really helped us
contain them,” Matthews said.
“Their guards didn’t really do
much damage after that.”

A ‘ pre-season All—Big East
selection, Murdock has combined
with Screen to become one of the
Big East’s most-feared guard duos.
The Friar history books also mark

Murdock and Screen as No. 1 and .

2 in career steals. The senior
Screen, in addition, is sixth in Big

East all—time steals.

Matthews concurred on their
talent. “They penetrate a lot and
cause problems.”

“I thought [Murdock] was being
aggressive trying to set a tone for
us,” Providence Coach Rick
Barnes said. “[Screenl sprained a
toe and wasn’t as effective as he
could be. There’s no question
they’ve got to play better for us.”

“We just turned the ball over
on key situations,” Screen said,
“and didn’t make a lot of easy
shots we were supposed to
make.”

Screen was only able to convert
four of 15 from-the ﬂoor for
seven points, less than half as

many as his season average,
although he doubled what is his
season average on rebounds and
assists with four boards and 11
assists.

Murdock, who went out with
5:09 left in second half after a
collision with Pitt’s Darren
Momingstar, tallied 18 points, four
rebounds and four assists. Despite
his efforts, the Friars were never
really able to get things together
and mount a successful run.

“In the second half we needed
to stop [Screen and Murdockl,”
said Matthews. “They were hitting

some [three—pointersl, but we

were able to stop them. All our
guys did a good job. The press

worked well for us.”

Screen credited the Pitt guards
for opening up holes in the paint
and forcing the game inside.
“They played very intense on
defense and tried not to give us a
lot of what we wanted on offense.
They were just doing their job.”

Providence forward Marty
Conlon, who with 15 points
topped 1,000 for his career, also
noted the play of Matthews and
Porter as a catalyst for the win. “I
thought they did a good job.
Porter’s in a tough situation,
having to switch to guard, but he
looked really good tonight. Setting

them up and getting them good

both diving events, giving Pitt the
top four finishers in each one.

Pitt finished first in 13 out the
20 events between the eight
schools. Other Pitt winners
included Matt Weist (100 and
200-breast), Eric Mattson (400-
individual medley) and Dave
Schepner in the 1650-freestyle.

“I think the team did excellent,"
said Coach Dick Bradshaw. “To
win over half the events 5 is
something unusual.” He said this
was a great achievement because
Syracuse and Connecticut (fourth
place) have shown improvement

and Villanova always has a strong
team.

Pitt also won the 200-free relay
with Matt Porter, David
Bacharach, Fred Constantini and
Eric Cornell and the 400-relay
medley team of Fred Constantini,
Kevin McLaughlin, Eric Cornell
and Matt Porter.

The Panthers will ‘be off for
three weeks and then compete at
the Eastern Seaboard Swimming
and Diving Championships at
Army. They ﬁnished fourth last
year and Bradshaw would like to
see at least a second place ﬁnish
this year.

Lady Panthers Big  
East Champs again

Pitt’s women’s swim team successfully defended its Big East title
this weekend by winning the conference championships held at
Tree’s Pool. They easily outdistanced second place Villanova by a

score of 805.5 to 680.

Lady Panther Donna Flatch was the diver of the meet. She won the
1-meter event and placed second in the 3-meter. Providence’s Cindi
Luciani was the swimmer of the meet. A

Pitt’s Karin Masal won the 200-yard breaststroke and placed
second in the 100 breaststroke. Laura-Lee Sullivan took ﬁrst in the 100
breast and second in the 200 breast. 0 '

Laure Walczak won the 50 freestyle event with a time of :24.09. She
won the event last year with a time of :24.02. Theresa Picklo placed
second in the 500 freestyle. Trina Thames took second in the both
the 100 and the 200 backstroke events.

Boston College took third followed by Syracuse, Providence,
Connecticut, St. John’s, Georgetown, and Seton Hall.

This is the eighth straight Big East Championship for Pitt.

Friars

in the first half, and Pitt went in

the locker room with a

comfortable 13-point lead. 0

Pitt, however, was out-
rebounded in the first half 24-13,
and 46-33 for the game. Pitt Coach
Paul Evans said one factor that
caused thatwas the 29 Providence
three-point attempts. With the
long shot, the ball bounced out
further than usual, catching the
Panthers off guard. “Our kids
didn’t adjust very well and came
up with some of the loose ones,”
said Evans.

Barnes added that shooting 66
percent from the ﬁeld doesn’t
leave much opportunity for
offensive rebounds. Pitt grabbed
just three offensive boards.

Brookin hit two free throws
with 4:20 remaining in the game,
giving Pitt a 100-77 lead. But
Providence went on a 16 to four

run to cut the lead to 11 points _

with 1: 19 remaining. But the Friars
had to foul down the stretch in
desperation. Pat Cavanaugh, who
had 11 points, was sent to the line

four times in the last 2:13 and
made seven of eight.

No one on the Panther team i

knew about Shorter being so close
to the NCAA ﬁeld—goal record, so
they didn’twork the ball to him at
the end of the game. .

“We didn’t hear it in time, and
then I told Darelle,” said Evans.
“Darelle thought we were [saying
that] he needed to get fouled, so
he sent him out in the corner to
get fouled.”

Game Notes: Marques Bragg
and Eric Murdock lead the Friars
with 18 points apiece. Murdock
left late in the game when he and
Darren Morningstar collided
going for a loose ball. Marty
Conlon, who scored 15 points,
became the 26th player in
Providence history to score over
1,000 points for a career.
Georgetown had the previous
team high of 113 points against
Seton Hall in March of 1982.
Patrick E Ewing and Sherman
Douglas hit 10 of 10 ﬁeld goals in
a game during their Big East
careers.

shots, and they scored a lot of
points on us. We run a lot, but we
shouldn’t have let that many points
go. I think tl1at’s partially our
fault.” 1

This Pitt team, which at one
point had an uphill climb towards
the ' National Invitational
Tournament, is coming on strong
because of team play like that

against Providence. According to
Conlon, “T here’is not a big
difference between Pitt and
Georgetown. Right now I think
Pitt’s playing excellently. I don’t
think right now there’s a team in
the Big East playing better than
Pitt. Pitt had the Sean Miller
problem early and that takes some
time, but if they keep going they
can make an NCAA bid.-”

Richards feels his speed will
make him a better defensive
player. Lewis believes he’ll be
able to use his speed to his
advantage not only in the ﬁeld,
but on the base paths as well.
“He’ll be turning a lot of his
singles into doubles.”

Richards is a native of Laventille
Village in Trinidad; his family
also resided in St. Croix in the
Bahamas before moving to Texas
when he was nine. “I haven’t
played football for that long, but
I’ve played baseball my whole
life. I really enjoy baseball more.
It’s just more fun.”

Not being in the spotlight
doesn't seem to bother Richards.

“The coaches and players still

for the spotlight. I just really love

Baseball Notes:

The Panthers’ first game will be
against St. Joseph on March 4 as
part of the team’s annual Florida
spring trip. They will play six
games in six days during their
stay in the Sunshine State. ‘‘If we
arrive on Friday [March 2], we’ll

Teams in the North are at a real
disadvantage when they play
teams in the South. They have
already played games outside. As
soon as we step on the field, our
players will be asking ‘where’s
the roof,”’ said Lewis.

The Big East is going with a
new schedule format this season.
Every team will play conference
schools in a three—game series.

Mutombo may be next foreigner to make impact in NBA

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

LANDOVER, Md. (Feb. 7) —
Manute Bol, Akeem Olajuwo and
Rik Srnits, all foreign basketball
players over seven feet tall have
offered their size to American
professional teams. The trend of
adding foreign players to NBA
rosters is sure to continue. Another
player seems to have a good
chance at entering that group
soon.

Georgetown’s 7-foot—2-inch
Dikembe Mutombo of Kinshasa,
Zaire, has quickly risen as one of
the top college basketball players
in America.

The junior center for the fifth-
ranked Hoyas has played the
sport of basketball for only five
years. He grew up playing karate,
soccer and volleyball in Zaire.
His father pushed him to play
basketball.

“It was very difficult playing
basketball for me. If it was not for

External 
Internal
Secretary
Sergeant at Arms

    
 
 
  

my father, I would not be playing
basketball today,” said Mutombo.

His father may want to look for
a job as a basketball scout.
Mutombo has become one of the
best defensive players in the
country, especially in the shot-
blocking department. He has 89
blocks, averaging almost five per
game. He had eight last
Wednesday in a 97-81 victory
against Pitt.

He is also a valuable contributor
to the Hoya offense with his
hook shot that not many players
can touch. He had 17 points and
1 5 rebounds against the Panthers.

“Dikembe! Oh my goodness,”
said Pitt's Bobby Martin. “Our
[defensive] game plan was to
play in back of him. We did that,
but he hooked us to death.”

He averages 9.5 points and 9.6
rebounds while playing 23
minutes a game. He was seven
for eight from the field and three
for four fromthe foul line against
Pitt.

“Now he's shooting foul shots,
which makes it scary," said Pitt
Coach Paul Evans.

Mutombo combined with
Mourning last year to block 244
shots. This year they have blocked
a total of 141 shots.

Size is not the only factor in
shot blocking. Mutombo said
Hoya Coach John Thompson
teaches them how to block shots.

“We practice how to block
shots, " said Mutombo. “That’s why
we are getting better every time
we block shots. Coach Thompson
is a 6—foot-10-inch guy. He knows

how to work with the big guys.
He played for the NBA He played
with the great [shot blockers] like
Bill Russell.”

Thompson played back-up to
Russell on two Boston Celtic
world championship teams in
1964-65 and 196566.

Earlier this season, Celtic
President Red Auerbach
suggested to Thompson that he
play Mutombo and 6-10
teammate Alonzo Mourning
together more this season.
Thompson alternated them at
center last season, rarely putting

both of them on the court at the D

same time. But Thompson
listened to the basketball legend
and has started both of them for
most of the season. _

“I didn’t play them together too
much last year,” said Thompson.
“When the word comes from up
higher, you try [it] at least.”

Thompson implemented a
variety of defenses against Pitt
last Wednesday. One way he
used Mutombo and Mourning
together was in a 1-3-1 zone with
Mourning underneath the basket

Mutombo likes the Hoyas’ twin-
tower lineup.

“I am very happy to play with
[Mourning] this year,” said
Mutombo. “I love to play with
himbecause we cover some spots
on the court very well.”

Mutombo said the Pitt game
was a new start of the season for

concentration. I’m going back
like I just started the season.”

“He played hard [against Pittl,”
said Mourning. “He got a lot of
loose balls, blocked shots and
ran the ﬂoor. He makes a lot of
good things happen. If he plays
like that all the time, that’s going
to beneﬁt us greatly.”

Mutombo has not heard much
praise from his coach, however.
“I wish he would [tell me when I
play well],” said Mutombo

laughing. “He never says to me
that I play well. He always tells
me when I play bad.”

“Yeah, I usually get on his
Case,” said a smiling Thompson.

“I have to do what Coach
Thompson asks me to do,” said
Mutombo. “Ihave to work hard
and block shots, and I know that
if I don’t block shots, I’m going to
sit on the bench.”

Mutombo has played with pain
in his right thumb, which he hurt
Jan. 2 against Boston College. He
cut his thumb catching a pass.
The cut required four stitches in
the joint of the thumb. The injury

THE Pl’l'I‘ NEWS, Monday, February 12, 1990

has limited his production lately.

“I’m trying to work with this.
My thumb still hurts. I just play
like I don’t care that much about
this thumb. If I do care about this
thumb, then I don’t want to play
much.” _

He is working on improving
his all-around game in time for
the post-season tournaments. He,
said that includes the mental
aspect. ‘

“Before the NCAA tournament,
I think I’ll be ready,” said
Mutombo.
