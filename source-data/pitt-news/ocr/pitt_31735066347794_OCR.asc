Nyden Refuses Compromise Position

BY MREA CSORBA

The University administration
met with senior sociology faculty
members Monday to hear their
concerns about the possible re-
instatement of fired assistant
professor”Paul Nyden, for a second
three-year contract with the de-

partment.
It appears the Marxist professor,
whose contract the University

Senate Council hearing board
Friday recommended be renewed,
allegedly has alienated many of'his
colleagues with what the board
found to be “inflammatory state-
ments and publications directed
against the department.” _

An earlier committee reportedly
found a “closing of the ranks” with
the sociology department due to
student protests and Pitt News
letters to the editor in which Nyden
attempted to regain his position
last March. .

Nyderi said he learned from an
unnamed participant of Monday’s

DAVID POWERS

meeting“ that the senior faculty
group discussed a number of

. alternatives to his re-instatement in‘

the sociology department. The
possibilities of making him a
University floating professor,
channeling him into another
department, or making him re-
sponsible to the Social.Science
Council, were reportedly suggested
in the meeting attended by Provost
Rhoten Smith, assistant ’Provost
David Powers and Faculty of Arts
and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg. ‘

“We met to hear their concerns
in case the Chancellor decides to
rehire Nyden," Powers
yesterday. Powers,

said -
however,’

refused to confirm the content of ‘

the discussion.

“We listened to different sug-
gestions. A lot of considerations
were mentioned. We made no
response to them,” he said.

Nyden said he will not accept
such a solution.

“The recommendation of the

hearing board was to reinstate me

for a three-year contract with the .

sociology department specifically.
I will not ‘ accept a position
anywhere else,” he said. “I will

approved University Senate Council
guideline has been drafted by the
Graduate and Professional Students
Association (GSPA).

 Sharon Johnson Case  

 Resumes Non-Jury Trial

Ll:

Both sides in the Sharon Johnson
sex discrimation case against Pitt
are summarizing their testimony in
the courtroom of Judge William
Knox today. '

Johnson, a ‘Pitt bio-chemistry
professor,» was denied tenure ‘in
1971. She retained her University
position when Judge Knox handed
down an injunction, called by some
a “landmark decision,” which
ordered Johnson to be allowed to
keep her job at Pitt until the suit is
resolved.

When Johnson’s ‘anneal rniited

University channels, the Academic
Freedom and Tenure Committee of
the University Senate found evid-
ence of sex discrimination and

#-

harrassment directed at Johnson.

In 1972 the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission urged the
University to settle out of court for
back pay and tenure.

Johnson ﬁled suit -in 19‘/‘.5.
Last fall, University lawyers
charged‘ Johnson’s attorney, Sylvia

Roberts, with professional miscon- N

duct for the release of a newsletter
on Johnson’s case.

Several of Johnson’s advocates,
including the American Association
of University Women, urged Pitt to
“withdraw the charges lodged
against Sylvia Roberts.”

I

' English,
whenever possible to ‘determine

ﬁght that resolution to my case.”

The hearing board, which
conducted a two-week
study of the evaluation process by
which Nyden’s position with the
University was terminated, re-
leased a unanimous recommenda-
tion last Friday to re-hire the
31-year-old sociologist.

They based their conclusion on
testimony by University and
no_r_i-University persons who con-
cluded Nyden’s department failed
to communicate to him the specific
criteria he was to achieve within his
three-year contract with Pitt.

The report, however, vindicated
the department. on a 'number of

. charges including political bias and

secret manipulation alleged by

Nyden during his 14-month fight to

retain his position.

_ ‘Chancellor Wesley Posvar, who
is expected to make a decision on
the hearing board’s recommen-

‘dation, was unavailable to com-

ment on the alleged. suggestions
discussed by the sociology faculty.

Nydenrequested and has been
granted an interview with the

Chancellor today to express his

non-acquiescence to the alleged
senior _faculty suggestions.

The proposal, which will be
presented to the Senate Council
June 13, is a response to the stricter
guidlines for competancy in spoken
English of foreign teaching assis-
tants, according to GSPA vice-
chairman William Voharas.
.“‘When a student'can’t under-
stand his TA or TF, he can always go
to the professor of the course for
help. But where -can he go if he
doesn’t understand his professor?’ ’
asked Voharas. . .
“There have been no recent
complaints from students about
difficulty in understanding pro-
fessors, but the standard of
comprehensible English should be
applied to all instructors,” he said.
The three-clause resolution
states every department which uses
full or part-time tenure or tenure
stream faculty teaching courses, in
which the language of instruction is
English, must take steps to insure
the oral competence of those faculty
members prior to appointment.
According to the text of the
resolution, each faculty member’s
speech must be comprehensible to
students in normal conversational
using oral interviews

such capability.

The resolution also points out that
if a faculty member who must use
English to teach is found to have an
inadequate command of the lan-

' guage, he will have ‘one year to

correct his deficiency.

If the instructor’s speech has not
improved after that time, the
resolution" requires he not be

Voharas said the existence of a
deﬁciency would not be acceptable
grounds for nonconferral of contract
renewal, tenure or promotion.

Part  

In Energy Program

By RICH HARRY

A Pitt professor yesterday
dismissed. reports a contract
authorizing Pitt to serve as an
evaluative tool of a county-wide
energy conservation program had
been accepted between the Univer-
sity and a federal administrative
agency.

Paul Hammond, environmental
and public policies professor, said
no contract between him and the
federal Energy Research and
Development Administration
(ERDA) had been agreed upon. The
contract supposedly would have
allowed the University and ERDA to
monitor “Project Pacesetter,” an
energy conservation program in
Allegheny County to be used as a
national model.

Hammond’s statement followed a
press conference Monday at which
federal energy administratgr John
F. O’Leary, said Pitt, in conjunction
with ERDA, would evaluate the
effectiveness of the one-year study.

“It was a misunderstanding,”
Hammond said yesterdav. explain-

ing when he earlier expressed a
willingness for Pitt to act as a

monitor with ERDA but did not .

follow formal procedure in securing
a contract with the federal agency.

Executive assistant to the Chan-
cellor Edward Bozik, who attended
Monday’s news brieﬁng on behalf
on the University, said he was
‘ ‘surprised’ ’ to learn Pitt supposed-
ly would evaluate the project. Bozik
added, however, he ‘ ‘knew for some
time” about “Project Pacesetter”
and that Chancellor Wesley Posvar
would head an educational task
force, one of ﬁve such groups in the
program.

When asked why O’Leary
believed the contract had been
ﬁnalized, Hammond . said, “He
(O’Leary) was probably mistakenly
told about it by someone here.”

Hammond added he will continue
to seek a contract authorizing Pitt
with a monitoring role, adding “I
hope something works out soon... it
seems the goal of ‘Project
Pacesetter’ is to know afterward
where we saved energy and where
we didn’t.”

involved in the break-in at

that he participated in or approved

BISHOPS DIVORCE
_ CENTURY-OLD LAW

CHICAGO (AP)—The nation's ‘

Roman Catholic bishops voted
overwhelmingly yesterday to repeal
a century-old church law excom-
municating Catholics who have
divorced and remarried.

The bishops voted 231-8 to revoke
the excommunications decree of the
Third Council of Baltimore in 1884,
a penalty applied only to American
Catholics.

Revoking it still requires conﬁr-
mation of the Pope, butthis was
considered almost a foregone
conclusion since the edict involved‘

. only this country.

Estimates put the number of
divorced, remarried Catholics in the
United States at aout ﬁve million.

Estimates are still incomplete,
but in some orchards along Lake
Erie farmers lost as much as 90 per
cent of their apple and swift cherry
crop when temperatures ipped to
22 degress last Friday.

Erie County grape growers, who
account for 90 per cent of the state’s
production, estimate their harvest
will be down 25 to 30 per cent this
year.

"7! Years of Collegiate Journaiism at the University of Pittsburgh "

   

The Place for Nyden

To almost _no one’s surprise, several of the University’s upper-
level administrators are joining the sociology faculty in discussing

’‘ possible solutions to the latest twist in the Paul Nyden story.

And, the Pitt News has learned, most scenarios being drawn in-
clude Nyden as an employe of the University. This means Nyden,
whose contract lapsed Saturday, would be given another pact and,
upon its completion, a final tenure review.

But that does not mean this story will have a happy ending. For
several of the proposed “solutions” do not follow the hearing
board’s recommendation that Nyden be offered his post as
assistant professor of sociologv. ’

Many M635 are being tossed between the Cathedral and Mervis

.Hall; three, however, apparently are being considered most

seriously;

One would have Nyden be a professor without a department.
Hisat-large post would have him teach where needed and be
responsible only to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome

' . Rosenberg.

The second idea is for Nyden to teach in a department other than
sociology, probably history. ‘

The third leaves Nyden department-less and would make him .

responsible to Pitt’s Social Sciences Council, a committee of all
«social sciences chairman. ‘

/ C .
A more obvious decision, however, reportedly has not received
much consideration. Why not reappoint Nyden to a p0SltlOI'l with
the sociology department? ‘ A ‘-

"The at-large post would leave Nyden without a department from

which to work and would make Rosenberg—the man who should

have detected the procedural error in Nyden’s contract
review—Nyden’s immediate superior.

Amove, to history or elsewhere, not only removes Nyden from
his field, but also throws him into a foreign academic area.

And, finally, the last suggestion also removes him from
sociology andleaves him with little concrete foundation for. con-
struction of his tenure defense.

Does Pitt want to give Nyden another contract and a chance for
tenure because of an error in its way of judging his work, or does it
want merely to pigeon-hole him for an obligatory three years? This
must be decided soon. If the former is the case, then return

ing Nyden to the sociology faculty seems, the only logical step. And i
. in the event Nyden’s fate is the latter, he should be informed his

future is not at Pitt to enable him tofind it elsewhere.

Unless it can be proved that Nyden has so little“ support from the
sociology faculty that his return would be impossible-—and that is

Vunlikely, despite unfortunate» actions on each side in. the past

year——he should be reappointed to the sociology faculty as an‘
assistant professor. And if Nyden cannot be returned to his
department, to offer him another contract and would be a waste of
his time, Pitt’s time and the taxpayer’s (and tuition-payers’?
money. i

Letters to the Editor

Panel Did Not Review Nyden’s Tenure Qualiﬁcation

I want to thank you for your
editorial of, May ,3, urging the
Chancellor to follow the recom-
mendation of his hearing board to
give me a second three-year

appointment as assistant professor. '

I also want to point out one
inaccuracy; your editorial stated

- that the hearing board “did decide,

however, that the negative review
of his professional qualiﬁcation was
a sound professional judgment."

_ In their report of April 29, the
_board stated:

“For purposes of 4

this decision we assume that the
determination of the department
was basedon an honest profes-
sional judgment." They also noted

, “That issue is beyond our authority

as a board and beyond our

' competency.’ '

Thus the board did not decide
one way or the other whether or not
the sociology department was
correct in their negative evaluation
of my scholarly work; they were not
charged to examine issues --opf
substance in their review. I would

have welcomed such a reviewand
would point out. that many
nationally-prominent social scien-
tists have praised by past and.
present work highly.

I too hope that the Chancellor
accepts the unanimous recommen-
dation of his hearing board and that
[can resume teaching and research

Paul J. Nyden
Assistant Professor

Reader Urges Boycott of J .P. Stevens Textiles

Textile labor is one‘ of the last.

-industries to be organized into a
union. For textile workers this
means being among the lowest paid
laborers with an average wage

$1.40 below the national factory‘

average. Textile labor is largely
made up of women and blacks——
groups which have historically been
viewed as expendable. Thus, these
workers are subjected to hazardous
working conditions, such as noise
levels above 100 decibels. In the
cotton mills, workers are exposed to

ma disabling disease known as

“brown lung’ which is caused by
the inhalation of cotton dust. The
textile industry also uses conven-
tional psychological forces to keep
the workers “in their place”—in-
timidation, exploitation of racial
and sexual tensions and harrass-
merit.
J .1’. Stevens is the second largest
textile manufacturer in the world.
‘employing over 44,000 workers in
85 plants. It also is probably the
largest industrial lawbrea-ker in the
U.S. This company has shown
ﬂagrant and often violent disregard
for the rights of its workers, starting
in the ’40s and’S0s when it
closed down its northern mills. to
ﬁnd “cheap” labor in the South.
Now in the 1970s it continues this
tradition by breaking unions, laws
and court orders. J .P. Stevens has
shown it will do anvthiniz to obtain
the most proﬁt; it has ﬂouted the
regualtions of the National Labor
Relations Board and the Equal
Employment Opportunity Comm-
ission, ignored citations from the
Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and even went as far
as to close down a plant that had
unionized. Pittsburghers should be
sensitive to all these problems,
especially that of the “runaway”
plant. U.S. Steel's recent threat to

leave our town‘ was just another .
example of the ugly tactics used by

/

industry against workers and their
communities. '

Until textile workers have the
right to unionized bargaining’ and
are given fair grievance procedures
their (and our) predicament will
remain the same. Thus, . the
AFL-CIO and the recently merged
Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union have designated a
J .P. Stevens union drive as a major
focus for this period._ Stevens
workers are calling on all consumers
to boycott the products‘ of J .P.

Stevens. They are hoping that this.

economic pressure \will force the
company to recognize the union and
bargain in~good faith.
Pittsburghers can relate to the
boycott in many ways. There are
several boycott committees in the
city, including‘ a labor and a
women's committee. The Pitt
community can relate in a special
way through the forming University
Committee. Even if active
participation is not personally
possible, the conscious‘ boycotting
of Stevens’ products is essential.
However, the decision not to buy

‘the products isn’t as easy as it

seems. since the Stevens name is

not found on most of the’

merchandise. ' You can ﬁnd,

Registration:  Pau|ine’s Perils Arrive in Triplicate

By LISA RUBENSTEIN

Poor Pauline Pitt. It all started

one fine spring day when Pauline '

decided not to go to school spring
session even though
already registered for. classes.
Pauline hadn’t paid her bill and she
wanted to make sure that she
wouldn't be saddled with punitive
charges one day far in the future
when she thought she could
graduate and be released.
So. . .Pauline, naive as she was at the
time, called the registrar’s‘ office
and explained that she hadn’t paid
her bill and that she wanted to know
how to work it out. A woman with a
nice voice said, “Call the Dean’s
office.”

Pauline knew she was a student in
the College of Arts and Sciences and
so early Monday morning she went
up to the 9th ﬂoor of that great
monument of education A , the
Cathedral of Learning, to visit the
cifﬁce of the Dean of CAS.

“Hello,” said Pauline, who was
slightly winded from the short trek
up the stairs from the 8th ﬂoor.

A woman with blonde hair and an
‘i.n-box’ heaped high with letters
said, “Can I help you?” It sounded
so genuine that Poor Pauline
thought the woman would really be
able to help her.

‘I registered for spring session
classes and I haven’t paid my bill
yet. But the trick is that I don’t want
to go to school this term. What do I
have to do to make sure that my bill
is voided and my registration

, cancelled?” she asked.

The woman behind the counter
handed Pauline a form with a white
copy for the Dean, a canary copy for
the registrar, a green copy for the
ofliceof student accounts anda pink
copy for the Vice Chancellor of
student affairs’ office. On the form
were spaces for everyone’s sign-
ature, including the professors of
the courses ‘which she planned to
drop. p  s

The woman in the Dean’s office
‘(We
don ’t require the signatures of your

professors in order for you to drop

your classes, ‘but the office of
student accounts may require them.

Go down to student accounts and
they will tell you what to do in order
to void payment.’ After you work
that out, you come back here and
the Dean will sign this form.”

“Sure,” Pauline said as she
practicallyiwalked into a glass door
marked OUT.

Poor Pauline---She got to the
office of student accounts and
waited in line until a slight
grey-haired woman wearing an
A-line dress came up to her and
said, “I work here, let me see your
invoice.” _

“Oh, but I don’t have an invoice.
I want to have my bill voided.”

“No one here can help you with

Poor Pauline—she clutched her
original pink registration form and
her handwritten invoice and her
form from the Dean’s Office and its
three carbons and walked down the
hall to G-36. *

She had often walked down that
very hall, never knowing what
special services were for.

She finally arrived at the

window. In addition to her three
forms she held a mustard colored

across the counter and steal the

things like this to you students?”

Pauline sighed. Finally, she had

Edgar Speer, chairman of the
board of United States Steel, is at it
again. ‘Protesting what he
considers to be strict pollution
standards set by Allegheny Coun-
ty. he has once again threatened to
move his corporation out of the
area. "

Moving a corporation out of here
is a lot morecomplicated task than
moving an autobody shop to a
bigger garageacross the street.
It's more than expensive-—it's a
risk that could mean loss of millions
or even failure of the corporation
itself. And it's a_ move that, once
made, cannot be takenback.

ear. Someone who could eliminate
the red tape with a slash of her Bic
pen. «
‘‘All you have to do is have each
of your professors sign this form
and make sure they write that you
never attended class. And then the
Dean will sign it and then you
won’t have to pay anything for not
going to school here.”

At last, Pauline thought--absol-
ution. A

Another day passed and Pauline
scurried about the University
getting signatures from her profes-
ors, explaining to each of them the
nature of the form she brought.

On the third day, Pauline walked
into the cathedral, assured that this
would be her ﬁnal trip. She was
happy in the knowledge that she
was about to conquer the system.

U.S. Steel employs. a’ big
percentage of Pittsburgh area
labor. . And they play the city,
county and state a lot of tax dollars.

Needless ‘to say..; their absence
would be felt.

However, U.S. Steel is also the
major polluter, of Allegheny county.
The amount of poison the mills
dump into the river and air is
second to none. And they fail to
meet air quality standardsiset b

i this County. '

Since U.S. ‘Steel fails to meet the
standards. either they are wrong or
the ’stand_ard-s are wrong. Other
steelmakers ‘comply with the law.

She took the elevator up to the

she said to one of the women in the

searched frantically for the woman
who had solved all of her problems
the first day. She did not relish the
thought of explaining her predic-

The Greening
Of the Cathedral

By DAN KACZMARSKI

Ah, spring. When a young man’s
fancies traditionally turn to amor-
ous concerns. A

But what if the bloom of youth is
just a memory, you are already
happily married and have five
offspring at home to seal the
bargain? ’

If you are Ken Soergel,’when you
hear those first robins your
thoughts turn to grass seed and
concrete. -—

Soergel is supervisor of~Pitt’s
Environmental Services Landscape
Division. He and his crew,
responsible for refurbishing and
maintaining the campus grounds,
are presented annually with a
budget totaling close to $500,000.

That money is used to repair
walkways, replace shrubs and grass
and keep the lawns and athletic
ﬁelds in topnotch condition, to
name but a few of the division’s
more visible activities.

This year, though, close to
one-half million dollars may not be

enough. The culprit is a familiar
one—-—the.severe winter of “the past

y€8.I’.

 

By MARY HUZINEC

Peculiar pipes, perfumed pa-
pungent perfumes, pretty
pots——-these are just a few of the
items available at Hare Krislzna,
the “U-Neek Head Shop." A visit
to the boutique is indeed a unique
experience.

When you ring the bell to enter,
a friendly salesgirl greets you at
the door with a warm, “Hi.” The
seductively sweet smell of incense
immediately fills your nostrils as
you enter into a world of
paraphernalia.

You are surrounded by trinkets,
albums, posters, clothes, books,
vases, beads, oils, stones and food.
Where do you begin? You ask.

The salesgirls let you look
around as much as you like, but they
gladly offer assistance if asked.

They’ll-explain that Hare Krish-
na sells mainly papers and incense,
but also supplies goods for local
Indians.

The owner, Anil Mishra, is a
short dark man, very helpful and
obviously proud of his store. He
and his younger brother have been
in America for 10 years and operate

“two Hare Krishna shops outside of

Oakland—one is downtown Pitts-
burgh, the other in Mount Oliver.
“We import our items mainly
fronilndia but also receive some
from Thailand, Japan, Korea and
Great Britain,” Mishra said.

He explained that Hare Krishna
is a religious term; Krishna is the
lord of all mystic beauty while Hare
is merely a word used to address
the god.

“The religion of India is more
likeﬂa philosophy of life,” Mishra
said. “My people believe in
hundreds of gods and don’t
necessarily worship in a temple
although there are local temples in
Monroeville and Penn Hills."

Mishra his brother are very
involved in sustaining the Indian
culture in Pittsburgh. Sundays at
noon they broadcast a radio
pi‘ogi"ani on WIXZ.

     
    

“Probably our single biggest
repair expense,” Soergel said, “is
replacing and repaving damaged
walks and roadways. We’ll still be
doing this year's work with next
year’s budget.”

Sidewalks, like Pittsburgh streets
and the family car, are not overly
fond of salt.

Neither is grass, said Soergel.
“You’ve probably noticed that
we’re reseeding the edges of the
lawns along the walkways. The
damage there was done by de-icers
that were put on the walks and got
onto the grass.”

Though; Mother Nature can be
counted on each year to personally
undo much of landscaping divis-
ion’s efforts, she can usually look
for help from human sources.

Conﬁrming what is obvious to
anyone familiar with the grounds
surrounding the Cathedral of
Learning, Soergel said that.the lawn
area on the Bellefield Avenue side,v
near Heinz Chapel, is a perennial
problem.

“That is deﬁnitely our worst
area,” he said. We have to reseed it
every year. It would take a whole
year of nothing but normal usage to

 

“The show is called ‘Manoran—
jan, Mishra explained. “The
vnord means ‘Melodies of India.’
On the program we provide Indian
entertainment, including sitar mu-
sic, music from Indian movies and
interviews with Indian people who
visit the area."

Of 36 students questioned, 19 were

the lack of any other conveniently

The Kinks

 

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

The year was 1964. The Beatles

‘ had just gotten the British rock

invasion in gear with their
mesmerizing performances on
“The Ed Sullivan Show” and much
media hype.

The Stones ‘were outraging
everyone with their insolence and
powerful Anglo rhythm ‘ii’ blues.
And if you were in America in ’_64

‘and listened toiyour radio, you

remember those sounds, the feel
and the experience of living during
the heyday of British rock ‘n’ roll.

Remember how all the blokes
from England had such nice, full
schoolboy haircuts. They smoked
cigarettes, chatted to any girl they

calleisl the “Noel Coward of the seventies” is the zany impetus behind the
Kinks’ combination of theater, camp, and rock. '

British Rock Is Still Stron

America competition, while making
it respectable, female—wise, for
young men to let the hair flow and
get into rock ’n’ roll. Remember? It
was only 13 years? ago.

The year is 1977. The Stones are
still kicking about; but Mick’s
become a jet-setter, more interes-
ted in his clothes and lunching with
Jackie than playing rock. His
friend, Keith Richard is also having
his problems. ’

You see, Keith likes his heroin
and coke—-society doesn’t and soon
he may be a jailbird really living the
blues. ,

As for the Beatles, who isn’t sick
and tired of hearing about the
campaigns which have emerged of
late trying to get them back

”B|ack Sunday/’--ACut

Above Average

By M.C. PILECKI

What Hollywood does best is
the old-fashioned, “big screen”
adventure story, short on ph11?S0'
phy and depth but long on action,
tricky shots and lots ofthrills and
chills.

Lately the screen’ has been
graced with not one but two such
samples of escapist fare, with plots
just complicated enought to create
and hold interest and characters
developed more than cardboard
only whennepcessary for the story.
“Black Sunday” and “The Eagle
Has Landed” provide a couple of
hours each of what the ads usually

. call “Solid entertainment,” light-.

weight stuff that fills the big screen
and leaves the customers happy,
not boggling their minds with social
commentary.

The “Black Sunday’? is a
contemporary story involving ter-
rorism and football (Black Septem-
ber and the “Super Sunday” of the
Super Bowl, thus the film's--and
best-selling book’s--title), with
good guys that aren’t too good and
bad guys that are much more
interesting and sympathetic. The
movie concerns a plot by Black
September (the people who gave
you Munich, 1972) to wipe out
everyone at the Orange Bowl on

9

“Super Sunday’ and the people
from the FBI and Israel trying to foil
the plot.-

In this corner we have the
terrorists, Marthe Keller as an Arab
whose life story would make anyone
want to blow up people and Bruce
Dern as a whacked-out former
VietNam POW and “hero” who
also ﬁnds plenty of justification for
wanting to wipe out a stadium.
They’re an odd couple to say the
least, but ingenious and quite
willing to go to any length for their
cause. i

Opposing them is the U.S. law
enforcement machinery (the odds
alone make them the underdog and
thus eligible for audience sym-
pathy) and particularly a veteran

Israeli agent, played by Robert‘

Shaw. The trouble is the Israeli is
not so sure about his job of killing
and maiming and even harbors
some doubts about his life’s work.

If it seems too much like the bad

guys are the good guys, wait till you ‘

get a load of the Super Bowl crowd
they want to kill. After listening to
the sad stories of the “Daddies,”
anyone would be glad to wipe out
the allegedly grown, mature people
who act like such unfeeling
imbeciles at the football game.

(Continued on Page 11)

why not let them spend their
imoney. i

What ‘about the other groups
from the British rock invasion?
Unfortunately all but the Who and
the superstar Yardbird guitarists,
Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy
Page, who are still stronger than
ever, are gone. Groups such as Billy

. J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Gerry

and the Pacemakers, the Troggs,
Wayne Fontana and the Mindben-
ders and the Pretty Things, have all
bitten the commercial dust. Too
Bad.

If you’re a keen-minded British
music fan you’re aware that one
group has been overlooked in this
general rehash. That group, my
friends, will no longer be over-
looked. We are going to take a look
at the Kinks.

The Kinks are perhaps the only
band that has survived since 1964
and are not a household word. The
band is still very much a cult item,
yet they make the type of records
(although much more lyrically
complex) and perform concerts that
are-——if they are anything at
all-fun. j

Led by the most lovable,
eccentric, crooning poof and nice
guy ever to grace a ‘rock ’n’ roll
stage, Raymond Douglas Davies,
the Kinks gave‘ a classic perfor-
mance of entertaining rock ’n’ roll
and theatrical buffonery Monday
night before a sell out crowd at the
Stanley Theater.

Kinks music is happy music. The
great and well—known hits of the
’60s and early ’70s, “You Really Got
Me,” “All the Day and All of the
Night,” “So Tired of Waiting” and
“Lola,” were played with glowing
smiles and were warmly received by
an appreciative audience, most of
whom were singing right along with
the band. i

In recent years, the Kinks have
written and performed songs that
have a great deal of literary/ theatric
quality about them. , ’

The British super band, The Kinks, entertained a crowd at the Stanley

Theatre with a high class act of theatrical buffoonery teamed with first rate

rock.

The songs from “Preservation
Act I & II,” “Soap Opera” and
“Schoolboys in Disgrace,” all have
themes and plots which were acted
out by Davies and the rest of the
band.

Whether it be a greasy playboy
singing a ’50s cruisin’ tune, an
ordinary man posing as a rock star
or an overly active schoolboy
singing the blues about school,
Davies was an expert at assuming
the pivotal musical character in
these one song dramas/ comedies or
laying back and narrating the
proceedings around him.’

_ In addition to Davies, the rest of
the band——brother Dave on lead
guitar, (keyboard player John
Gosling, drummer Mick Avory,
bassist Andy Pyle and two
unidentified horn men--provided
capable musical backup to the

antics of the crazy Ray. Two lovely‘

young ladies, dressed seductively in
black satin jumpsuits, appeared
periodically throughout the night to
make things interesting.

But undeniably, the Kinks are
Ray Davies. His tales of ordinary
life and people, “Ordinary
People,” “Rush Hour Blues,”
“You Make it all Worth While’ ’ and
“Alcohol” areall written under the
premise that everyone, no matter
how mundane their existence is, is a
star.

Dicks photo.

Davies in fact has said in
interviewsthat the so-called “rock
star life” is just another pose and
lifestyle which isn’t even as
interesting or enjoyable as the one
his audience leads.

_ So if ordinary people are
interesting,vcould it be possible that
stars are ordinary? Davies thinks so
and if you have any doubts, sit down

_and watch the guests on Johnny
Carson’s “Tonight Show” some
evening.
interesting than John Davidson or

Karen Valentine? _
The Kinks are a band that isn’t

foolhardy in ignoring their past. vet
they remain one of the most active
forces in contemporary music
because of scenario styled albums
whichvtake a look at life, people and
everyday situations.

The Kinks are an intelligent band ‘

that plays an intelligent brand or
music, filled with one song plays,
hard rockers and ballads that move
one to think; but not to the brink.
The Kinks don’t seem to take
themselves or the audience serious-
ly, but it doesn’t seem “I don’t give
a damn and I want to teal it all
down; ” it’s more a feeling of “take
a look around, take me downtown, I
simply want to have a goodtime.”
On a rainy Monday night in

Pittsburgh, that is the sort of
attitude that can help keep yot!
sane.

Murphy Defies Classification

By PETE DICKS

If there is any justice in the
rock and roll world, Elliott
Murphy’s name will become widely
known among music fans, as
evidenced by his exciting perform-
ance as the opening‘ act for the
Kinks Monday at the Stanley
Theatre.

Murphy is currently on tour to
promote his new Columbia album,
“Just a Story from America.”
Although the 27-year-old New York
singer-songwriter has three prev-
ious albums to his credit, all of
which have received tremendous
critical. praise,’ this is Murphy’s
first major tour, having performed
50 concerts already.

While being a warm—up act with
only 40 minutes to play, proves
disastrous for many groups,
Murphy and his band wisely took
advantage of their time; the songs
were varied in sound and all were
delivered with enthusiasm and
style.

. Murphy's albums have a somc—'

9

what "soflcr.’ more complcxly
rarrzmgcd sound than that of his live
performance. The five
performed from “Just a Story from

songs

. /
America” made a near-perfect
transition to a concert setting
thanks to Murphy’s tasteful sense
of arrangement and his excellent,
experienced musicians. A

His band includes: Peter Wood,-

co-author of Al Stewart's hit “Year
of the Cat," on keyborads; Les
Nicol, Leo Sayer’s guitarist; drum-
mer Jerry Shirley, formerly of
Humble Pie; and bass player Larry
Russel, who worked with singer-
songwriter Billy Joel.

Unfortunately for those not
familiar with his albums, 21 great
deal of Murphy’s lyrics were-buried
under’ the sound and were difficult
to distinguish Monday night. His
lyrics are some of the finest being
written today; they are honest and
deal with dilemmas real to him.

Murphy’s lyrics and voice sound
equally comfortable whether he is
singing a soft, slow songsuch as
“Rock Ballad," which he dedicated
to Rolling Stones guitarist Keith
Richard or his closing song, thc
raging rocker “Drive All Night,"
which is being released as a single
this week.

The adaptability of several
different sounds into his lyrically

emphasized style makes Murphy
‘difficult to classify musically.

Murphy.’s style is distinct; he
develops his themes, such‘ as
middle class values and New York

City life. in a nearly journalistic

SENSE.

The effects of the much needed
exposure Elliott Murphy is receiv-
ing on this tour will not be

immediately known, but he may
soon beta major attraction.

Disaster

Fi|ms—-

I Not So Disastrous

(Continued fronz Page 10)
The movie deﬁnitely has a
problem with placing its sym-
pathies, a not uncommon problem,
and one that won’t bother audiences
in the least. What the ﬁlm does
have is some well paced action
sequences, particularly an amaz-
ingly photographed climax actually
shot-at the 1975 Super Bowl. There
is some excellent footage of the
game and crowd, blended with the
movie action (also shot during the

_ game).

Surprisingly enough, the ﬁlm is
no gorier than the average
television show. Sure, lots and lots
of people are killed, with phony
looking blood spurting out of bullet

_ holes, but (unlike many other flickls)

the camera doesn't linger on the
carnage or exploit the violence.

Dern again nuts in an excellent
performance as the deranged
veteran just hanging on to
“sanity.’l He even manages to
steal the show from Shaw, who
really wasn’t given enough to work
with. Keller gets a more interesting
character than her last role, (in
“Marathon Mail”) and handles
well the paradox of aterrorist leader
being terrorized in her “mission”
by a collaborator too often ready to
plunge into madness.

“Black Sunday” I is not the

greatest movie ever made, but it’s 5

very good escapist stuff, and the
kind that can only properly be seen
on the big screen.

/ ''_'1he Eagle Has Landed” is in
many ways a superior movie, even
without the A climax of “Black
Sunday.” “Eagle,” also adapted
from a best-seller, is about a
ﬁctitious mission launched by
desperate Germans near the end of
World War II.

The mission? To kidnap Winston
Churchill, giving Hitler more
bargaining power in the imminent
surrender. The result, you may
think, is obvious, since we know
history. But without violating
history (too much), “Eagle”
manages to be not so predictable,
with a surprise ending that has
more than just dramatic implicat-
ions. ~

For once, the ‘ ‘good guys’ ’ in this
WWII, ﬂick are the Germans (but
then, so are the “bad guys”),
Robert Duvall delivers his usuali
masterful‘ performance as the
creator of this whole plan. Actually,
he was first ordered to just make a
feasibility study of the idea, but as
more and more possibilities fall into
place, he’s seduced into thinking it
can actually be pulled off.

The “puller-offer” in this case is
Michael Caine, undergaying nobil-
ity and integrity as the leader of a
commando unit not -in sympathy
with Nazism’s grosser philos-
ophies. To show how much they
deserve the audience’s sympathies,
the entire i"1nit——-particularly
Caine—gets into serious trouble
trying to save a Jewish woman trom
the Gestapo. How nice can you get?

Helping to further the plan are .

Donald Sutherland who overplays
the part of an IRA leader and Jean
Marsh solidly portraying a German
spy in a small English town—the
setting for much of the action. The
transformation of this very green,
quiet town into a battlefront is the
major irony of the movie, with great
visual impact. ,
The ﬁlm never lags and is tailored
for those who can appreciate ‘an
intricately conceived plot.

THE SHIP sAI|.s on MAY 15.

. One of the best ways to get

into engineering is to get into

the nuclear Navy. But you’d

better get moving fast. May
15th is the deadline for this
year’s Navy Nuclear Propul-
sion Candidate Program.
The Navy can give you

the most comprehensive
nuclear training possible.
Because we operate over half
the nuclear reactors in
America. We start by giving
you a year of advanced engi-
neering technology. This
Would cost you thousands in

graduate school, but in the
Navy, we pay you.

Once you’re commissioned
as a Navy Nuclear Officer,  
you’ll earn a top salary. Over
$24,000 a year after four
years. And youfll get practical
experience on the most
advanced nuclear equipment
devised by man. All the Navy
asks in return is that you
serve for 3 years on active
duty upon completion of your
training.

But remember, May 15th
is the deadline for this year’s
class. If you are majoring in

Pittsburgh, a city that has beneﬁtted greatly from recent
National Football League drafts, began supplying talent in
addition to gleaning it. ‘

But, with the exception of Tony Dorsett’s thunderous (and
perhaps unprecedented) impact on the two-day lottery, such
was not the case. The Steelers, with some apparently
excellent middle-round selections, continued their tradition
of pouring a strong foundation each spring, but the Pitt
Panthers continued a tradition that is not so proud. Though
Pitt can fly a national-champion ﬂag, it can’t boast of having
been a major factor in the draft.

To be sure, Dorsett was the main event (and, for Dallas,
the main course) at New York's Roosevelt Hotel, site of the
draft, as well as the rest of the country. Rickey Bell was
chosen ﬁrst, but Tony—and how Dallas went about getting
him——was the subject of the afternoon and even morning
headlines. And not without good reason. Tony’s
cross-country and international pre-draft dealings seem to
be one of the most interesting stories in recent NFL history.

Many things transpired between the time Dorsett ran off
the Sugar Bowl ﬁeld in January and the instant he arrived at
Pitt Stadium Tuesday and, grinning, screamed, “I’m a
Cowboy. ” The story stretched from Pittsburgh to Seattle to

Toronto to Dallas to New York. And it ended with Tony’s
initials assuming a new message—to Dallas.

One report said Dallas first approached Seattle about the
Seahawks’ ﬁrst-round choice in January, soon after Dorsett
was eligible pro bait, free of NCAA restrictions. A very
reliable source said the deal was ﬁnalized more than a
month ago.

Either way, the game was far more complex than a simple
deal of draft choices. Seattle was involved, of course, but
probably in more ways than it would have preferred.
Dorsett and his various managers—of whom there are
many——weren’t particularly attracted to the idea of Seattle
Tony. The team was bad; the a_rea’s marketing
potential-for T ony, off-the-ﬁeld cash——was worse. Seattle
was clearly a team with which Tony Dorsett could become
just another Tony Dorsett.

So those with Dorsett’s best ﬁnancial interests in mind
(and, they hope, in future bank accounts) sent up two
warning ﬂares in an effort to steer Tony toward another NFL
team. And, though both may have been duds, the scheme
worked.

One involved a letter sent to Seattle,‘on Dorsett’s behalf,
that told the Seahawks their chances of ever seeing Dorsett
in their uniform were roughly equivalent to their chances of
playing Tampa-Bay in the next seven consecutive Super
Bowls. A brash move—“conﬁdent” was the word Dallas

ilsed to describe its new touchdown maker—but, coupled

 Bucs Continue Streak

with a threat of a move to Canada, it worked. Seattle forgot
about drafting Dorsett, and decided to accept Dallas’ offer.
Dallas and Dorsett thus realized a happy dream, and Seattle

got the worst of it, all because of a threat to go to a foreign 1

football team that now says it isn’t interested in Dorsett and
never conducted even ﬁfty cents worth of talks with Pitt's
Heisman Trophy holder.‘

Fine Print a

Bycrislloel

 

“We are not interested in Tony Dorsett,” said Toronto
Argonauts general manager Nick Shatto. “We have never
discussed anything with him that would lead to his playing
for us.”. V

What? The Argonauts not interested? Is this the same
team that was rumored to be waiting for a chance to sign a
Dorsett whose contract demands were not met by an NFL
team. It is, but they aren’t-—and never were—interested.

“Tony Dorsett is a great athlete and a ﬁne individual,”
Shatto told the Pitt News from his Toronto ofﬁce, ‘ ‘but we're
not in the market for a Tony Dorsett. We're in the market for
linemen and defensive backs, and that’s what we got. But
we never planned to have Tony Dorsett play in Toronto.”
' An interesting statement, coming from a man whose team
owns Canadian rights to Dorsett, whose agent, Mike Trope,
said Tuesday that “If Seattle had chosen Tony I think the
odds would have been 50-50 that he would have played in
Canada.”

Toronto, burned by Anthony Davis a few years ago in a
similar situation, is understandably not anxious to be used
by Dorsett in his quest for the right salary with the right
team.. And, that’s the way the Argonauts see Tony’s (or his
agents’) current actions. .

‘ “I don’t want to criticize their intentions,” Shatto said,
“but it seems to have been a bargaining wedge. In all

_ honesty, if he called and said he wanted to talk with us, we'd

have to respectfully decline.”
That must be good news in Dallas, for it would seem to
nullify one weapon (aren’t his careerand potential enough?)
Dorsett seeks to carry into his salary battle with the
Cowboys. ‘

“If we can’t agree on a contract,” Dorsett said Tuesday,
“I can go to Canada for two years and come back to the NFL
as a free agent.” Not according to what Shatto was saying
yesterday.

M ..

But Tony’s problems would be godsends to several of his
Panther teammates who fared, well, not as well as they may
have been expecting in the draft. Tight end Jim Corbett,
selected by Cincinnatti in the seventh round (of 12), would
not have been a surprising choice in the fourth or ﬁfth round.

But now,’ he'll have to go to the Cincinnatti camp a
middle-round pick of a team that has Bob Trumpy.

And punter Larry Swider, one of the nation’s best last .
season, also was ignored until the seventh go-round, when
Denver decided its thin air might have wonderful affects on
Swider’s ability to kick footballs.

Al Romano had reason to be the most surprised—and
dismayed—of all. Though he received numerous
All-America honors, his position, middle guard, caused pro"
scouts to let him remain through the eleventh round, when
Houston thought he might deserve a shot at linebacker. But
eleventh-round picks usually do not last long at pro camps,
and Romano will have to hustle if he plans to play for pay.

The other Panther chosen in the .next-to-last round,
Carson Long, was also a surprisingly low pick. Though he
didn’t live up to his pre-college billing, Carson was a
potentially good kicker. Maybe all the scouts were watching
two Thanksgivings ago, or maybe he was overshadowed.
Either way, he, too, will have to work if he expects to kick for 
the Rams.

The last Pitt player selected, defensive tackle‘ Don
Parrish, was not as widely-publicized as the Panthers who
preceded him in the draft, but deserves a shot at making a
team, in this case the Falcons. He just might stick.

And what happened to Cecil Johnson? Philadelphia,
reportedly interested in Johnson, loin?-d the rest of

the NFL in passing him by. A quick, strong, hard-hitting
defensive end-linebacker, Johnson has the physical
characteristics to land a place in the pros. Perhaps, work of
his knees—hurt in practice, well by Saturday—scared away
the scouts, making Johnson a free agent.

“It wasn’t spectacular,” a Pitt spokesman said of the
Panthers’ showing in this year's draft, in which three of the
ﬁrst five selections were from Southern Cal. “But then
again,” he continued, perhaps remembering Pitt’s
generally dismal showing in the past decade-’s drafts, “it
wasn’t bad, either.” J

Ed Ott, who had quite a night
himself "while collecting his ﬁrst
major league home run and ﬁrst
major league stolen base, was high

in his praise of Kison after the

game.

“Bruce threw a great game,” he
said. “He overpowered some of
their hitters and changed speeds
real well. And (second baseman
Rennie) Stennett made two unbe-
lievable plays out there tonight.”

The plays Ott referred to were a
twisting, leaping grab Stennett
made off the bat of Atlanta starter
and loser Buzz Capra in the ﬁfth and
a backhanded stop behind second
base to rob the speedy Moore
leading off the. ninth. ‘

“It’s good to get that kind of
support, both offensively and
defensively,” added Kison. “It’s a
pitcher’s dream. Rennie was
remarkable out there tonight.’ ’

A Netters Prove A Point

ByJIMPANE

The Pitt tennis team had two
things to prove in Tuesday's
rematch with Robert Morris at
Trees Courts.

Most important, the Panther
squad had to show that last, month ’ s
5-4 decision over the Colonials at
Robert Morris was no ﬂuke. The
Panther Squad did just that-this
time with a little more breathing

room, 6-3.
A personal _, battle involving

‘ Panther standout Tom Liebenguth

and his Robert Morris counterpart.
Dan Casey, was the second issue to
be settled. In ‘what Pitt coach
George Dieffenbach described as a
“fluke match,” Casey defeated
Liebenguth in singles action April 6.
giving the Panthers’ number-one
man good reason to try and save
face Tuesday.

Liebenguth responded by turning
in a true-to-form performance.
handing Casey a 6-1, 6-1 defeat.

“Liebenguth got his head
straight and just cfeamed him
today,’_’ Dieffenbach said after the

V-mismatch .

While the Pitt freshman was
“creaming” his opponent. his
teammates were playing as sweet as
sugar in building up a 5-1 Panther
lead, assuring them of their sixth

‘win of the season to go against one

loss.
Dieffenbach cited a double

advantage of a 5-1 cushion going - --

into doubles play. p

“The guys know we've already
clinched the match so it gives them
extra conﬁdence,” he /said as he
watched the court action. _ “It also
gives me a chance to use my
substitutes.”

As it turned out, Dieffenbach's
substitutes played with more
conﬁdence than the other Panther
pair-ups. Jeff Gordon, seeing
action for only the second time this
year, teamed with Joe Moran, who
made his initial appearance and
emerged with Pitt's lone doubles
victory. beating Jay Starr and Tom
Byme, 6-3. 6-3.

The team of Liebenguth and Mike
Habbel was overcome by a

never-say-die Colonial pair-up as

was the combination of Kevin Quay
and John Girty. who lost a tough

  
   

7-5, 6-4 decision—-but it didn't
matter in the ﬁnal outcome.

In addition to Liebenguth’s
singles win, twins Mike and Harry

Habbel defeated their opponents in -

straight sets. 6-4. 6-1 and 6-3, 7-5,
respectively.

  Pitt Golfers Shanked
By 29 at Aleghaiy

By JOHN FINN

Close but not close enough.
Such was the saga of the Pitt golf
team Tuesday in its match at

Allegheny College in Meadville.
While Pitt coach Steve Petro noted
improvement in the team's per-

formance, the Panthers still turned

I

. K

in a disappointing showing.

“We're improving,” Petro
claimed. “Not enough to win, but
at least to become contenders."

In a ﬁve-team match,
ﬁnished ﬁfth, 29 strokes behind the
winning score turned in by the host
team. The Panthers also fell
behind Mercyhurst, Grove City and
Westminister. ’

Pitt’s only noteworthy perfor-_

mance was that of freshman Jim
McGrath,‘ McGrath, .who is
establishing himself as the Pan-
ther's most consistent player, shot

.a 74 ﬁnish four strokes off the

winning pace set by Greg Stokes of
Allegheny. '
With
McCarthy as well as the three
Panthers who have been out of
action, Petro" was forced to use a

Pitt 1

the absence of Kevin-

makeshift lineup. McCarthy. who
played well at the Penn State

_ Invitational, was unable to attend.

Pitt captain Bill Burkardt. who had
been suffering from viral ulcers,
was not well enough to play,
although he is expected to be ready
for the Panther’s,ﬁnal match at the
Indiana Invitational. In addition,
Bruce Stephen and Bob Kurey will
not be playing for the remainder of
the year. V

This list of players comprises
four of Pitt’s top ﬁve men. Without
the services of these players, Petro
was forced to do some juggling, ,but
remained optimistic.

“I am really looking forward to
next season,’-’ he said, “because
we have a group of ﬁne players
coming back who are also very
dedicated." ‘

Petro also noted Pitt will miss
senior captain Bill Burkardt. “He
is a ﬁne player,” he said, “and a
great young man."

Pitt travels , to Youngstown
tomorrow before closing out the
season at the Indiana Invitational
on Friday.

started the Bucco scoring parade.
His stolen base came in the sixth,
after he had singled to ri . Dave
Parker followed with a b se hit to
plate Ott to make it 7-1, Bucs.

Omar Moreno clubbed his ﬁrst
homer of the season in the ﬁfth and
Willie Stargell connected for his
fourth roundtripper in three days to
lead off the seventh, contributing
to Capra’s departure.

Capra, who led the NL in ERA in

1974, has had elbow problems the-

past two seasons and was making
his ﬁrst start of 1977. He absorbed
the loss and is now 0-1.
Fernando Gozales, ﬁlling in for
‘ Phil Garner at third after the Bucs
went ahead 9-1, smacked a Bob
. Johnson fastball over the left ﬁeld
fence in the ninth for the Bucs’
fourth homer of the game, a seaso
high. , ’
But.it wasn’t all power, as the
go-go Bucs added three stolen
bases to their league-leading total
as Frank Taveres, Ott and Al Oliver
swiped second successfully.
Stennett and Tavares added two
if hits to‘ the Pirate attack and Kison
contributed by slamming-a double

E lineup had at least one hit in the

onslaught against four Atlanta
pitchers. Only Max Leon escaped
unscathed, as he hurled two shutout
innings. D
While Kison breezed to ‘victory
Monday night, starter Jerry Reuss
had no such luck on Tuesday as
he_ made his sixth. start of the
- season and has yet to post his initial
victory. Reuss pitched six and
one-third innings, giving up eight
hits and six runs (ﬁve earned)
before being relieved by Rich
Gossage, who promptly allowed the
Braves to tie the score when former
American League most valuable

player (1974) Jeff Burrouglisi

smashed a two-run homer to right.
The Bucs got on the board‘ in the
ﬁrst when Parker drew a walk,

moved to third on a single by Oliver, .

who proceeded to steal ‘second.

Both scored when Stargell lined a
single to center. The ﬁrst-inning
threat ended whenWillie was out
trying to steal second as the go-go
Bucs went two for four in stolen
base attempts. Parker was also

caught stealing (10th inning) but
Duffy Dyer and Oliver were
successful thieves.

Parker, who is on ﬁre at the plate,
smashed a solo home run in the
third, a two-run shot in the ﬁfth and
also singled in the 10th. His
three-for-ﬁve performance raised
his batting average to .412 with ﬁve
homers and 20 RBIs.

Burroughs totaled ﬁve RBIs on

Braves came, back for two in the
ﬁfth on an error by Garner, a single
by center ﬁelder Rowland Ofﬁce, a
run-scoring double by Burroughs,
and a single to left by Cito Gaston.
Garner got a run back in the sixth,
though, as he double-plated

Burroughs’ smash off Gossage

Niekro, a knuckleballer, seemed to
get stronger as the game pro-

Garner started things in the 11th
with a hit to left. Tanner sent up
Tommy Helms to bat for Tekulve
with orders to sacriﬁce Gamer to

bunt down third. Ed Ott, batting in
