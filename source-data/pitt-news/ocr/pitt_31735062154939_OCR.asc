Newly Elected _,

Trustees Head

Gwilym A. Price, chairman of

‘the board of the Westinghouse

Electric Corporation, was elected
president of the University Board
of rustees at a meeting on

ceeds the late

ous l y a s a

deed to have Price as president

vital time it is striving toward the
goal" established by the board,
that of becoming one of the
world's leading universities.’.'

“The great devotion of Price

Reject Plan
Of Captain

-The‘ University’s Board ot~Trus-
tees hast-ejected Capt. Tom Ham-

ilton's proposal to convert Pitt_

Stadium into a Municipal Sta-
dium, but no decision has been
made concering the playing site
for ‘Panther football games.

The Board action came at a
meeting last Thursday afternoon
and was announced by. Chancellor
Litchﬁeld on Friday. The chan-
cellor also denied reports that the
trustees have already voted .to
keep the games in the Stadium.

Vllithdrawal of the Hamilton
plan from consideration as ‘an
alternative to the North, Side
proposal came because “the
overwhelming weight of both
the factual evideneeand the
climate of relevant opinion" was
against it.‘

Dr. Li«tchﬁeld’s 19-page report
to the Board recommending re-
ecjtion of the plan came after a

. study by a New Yorlg engineering

ﬁrm. The chancelloresaid that he
also took into consideration the
ﬁndings of the City—County Sta-
dium’ Study Committee and the
opinions of other public and pri-
vate institutions affeeted by the
stadium plan. ‘
Although no one likes to see his
own idea defeated, Capt. Hamilton
accepted the decision of the
Board. “I'm glad to see that -the
matter was taken up by the de-
cision_-making body (the Board of
Trustees) and I feel very hopeful
that it will work out’ very hap-
pily for everyone concerned. I've
accepted their decision cheerfully;
we’ll try to do the best we can.”

Burg-e, Grande
To Study, Travel
011 Room Awards

The Office of Cultural and Edu-
cational Exchange has announced
two additional recipients of sum-
rher study and travel awards.
Barbara Burge, Ed. ’60 has re-
ceived the Scottish Award, which

is being offered for the ﬁrst time-

this year. Albert Grande, Arts

"’60, has won the Italian Award.

Both awards, presented by the
Scottish and Italian nationality
room committee, will provide the
juniors with expenses for travel
and study abroad this summer.

Miss Burge, an English major
in the School of Education, plans
to study English literature at the
University of Edinburgh.

She feels that before attempt-
ing to interpret literature to high
school -students, this study would
be valuable as a means of ob-
taining an insight into English; lit-
erature. Studying in a country
closely related to England and
yet separate would enable her to
view the subject objectively.

“By actually participating in the
rich cultural activities of Scot-.
land, insight and better under-
standing: will ‘be possible,’’. she
remarked.’ ‘V V I ‘- - ‘ ’ .-

 ral Arts Announce
_re-registration Plans

The School of Liberal Arts has setup the system _for

 advisers to aid students in

tn‘-mester. ' '

rently of underclass standing

pre-registration for the Fall

The program is especially geared to‘ aid students cur-

in selection of courses.

 Each student‘ will be assigned an appointment with a

general adviser to ﬁll out a dis-
tribution of courses sheet and,

lfor sophomores, to select a major

field.

‘ N‘ These students will then be

referred to the adviser for ma-
jors in their particular field,
with whom they should" make
an appointment April _27. The
major adviser will pre-register
students for the fall.
Pre-nursing and -combination
degree students (physical therapy,
ﬁve yr. Engineering or Dentistry

A, majors), and those intending to

transfer to the School of _Educa-
tion or Business Administration
should also consult a general ad-
viser. » .
' Those students with less than
45 credits by the end of the spring

—— semester will confer only with

the general adviser, who will pre-
i'egister- them. ‘
The .class cards for courses of-
‘fered in the fall will be made
‘up from study lists completed
‘at pre-registration, so tha t
should a student ' change his
’ mind -over the summer about a
‘course selection he should no-

 the University immediately.

Those completing less than 45
credits willalso ﬁll out tentative
schedules for the second and third
trir_r_1es*ter’of next year. Th e s e
schedules are to be used in con-
junction with a study being con-
ducted by Dr. David Henderson,
director of the trimester program,
for the purpose of determining
what courses will be offered. .

Richard Hodges of the Board of

-General Advisers emphasized that

students “should think about

their programs before seeing the

general advisor. This will make
things easier for both the student
and the advisor.”
Hodges. also brought out the
point that juniors and seniors,-
not presently included in the
advisory program, may be pre-
registered by contacting their
major‘-department adviser.
Because of the increasing num-
ber of students who will be as-
signed to classes ahead of time,
upper-division students may have
difficulty obtaining desired class

cards in the fall unless they pre-
register this spring.

A -Comparative" View  .

In Praise of Pitt

(Edttor’s Note: This column is the frank .corn-
parison by a .Unive1's'ity student of the under-
graduate education at this University’ and that of
a top Ivy League school. Because of the nature
of the column, the name for obvious reasons is
‘withheld. I ~

I am a, transfer student.-For two years I‘ at-

tended a New England University which many '

regard as the country’s ﬁnest, and then came
here to Pitt, where I have been for eight months
Although" Pitt is a long way from
becoming the great cultural cen
ter that is the other University,
in my view it~does a better job
of’e_ducating the undergraduate.
Let me explain what I mean . . .

The university in New Eng-
land holds several “advanced”
theories about education. One is
that the average‘ undergraduate
is prepared upon entering .to
cope with individual research in
one or more ﬁelds. In other
words, that an incoming fresh-

 

 

ready to think freely and inde-
pendently in experimental phys-.
ics, and perhaps to increase sig- - .
niﬁcantly the sum of human knowledge.

It has been my experience that most of those I _
knew were in‘ in fact not so prepared, and their
education suffered correspondingly. Not that these
“ignoramuses” failed courses, for this institution
believes extensively in curve grading, but no seri-
ous effort was made to teach them.

Faculty Silent to Questions ‘ ‘

One did not approach a faculty member for
instance, with‘ any question ‘which could be an-
swered by a book, even if the wgitten answer were
inordinately detailed and complex. On many oc-
casions I would have liked a brief oversimpliﬁca-A
tion of some scientiﬁc phenomenon, for instance,
if only for the sake of perspective, but faculty did
not like to be bothered with such elementary
matters. \ i ’

    

“There is nothing essentially wlrongwith look-‘

ing up a discouragingly incomprehensible explana-
tion in a book,“ but part of education, I feel, is to
encourage the student as well as to instruct him.

, Further, this institution holds that the man most _
deeply immersed in research is the man most com-
teach elementary (undergraduate)
courses in his ﬁeld. The catalogue of coursesioffers
a glittering eleven hundred selections, from which
the baffled student may choose, in his four years
sixteen. There is American history taught by the
author of some of our ﬁnest New Deal critiques.
There is poetry taught by perhaps the finest play-‘
wright of our day, and physics by a recent Nobel
laureate.-» I g "

But one must bear in mind that these men can-

not in the restrictions of their courses advance the
brilliant ideas which made them famous. The un-
dergraduate must learn certain fundamentals ﬁrst.
That these geniuses are the best possible teachers
of fundamentals is nonsense.

Teacher Must Study Teaching

The best teacher is the person who knows his

subject and has made a study of teaching. Doubt-

less, as agraduate center, the institution in ques-
tion is without peer. But the undergraduate is con-

fronted with an endless procession of brilliancies

delivered in a rambling and incohesive manner.

Pitt "is. different. Not altogether different, but
the emphasis is greatly shifted. Instead of a pro-
fessor’s being given his position purely on the basis
of publication and-research, his ability to teach
weighs heavily. I must confessl picked Pitt rather
haphazardlyg it was “the school around the corner,”
so to speak, and I applied more from a reluctance
not to than otherwise, for I simply wanted to go
to school, and if the other institution was unsatis-
factory, which could be ebetter?

So my reactions to Pitt are a surprise even to
myself. From the first I realized that the people
who are hereto teach are really intent upon that
particular job. Certainly there is great research
done, but somehow Pitt has been fortunate enough
to get people _who combine the high thinker with
theteacher of fundamentals. I
"Prestige Building" No!‘ compelled ~

How has Pitt done this, while other have failed?
By taking a sensible attitude about the relation of

‘teaching to research, and by not compelling inces-

sant “prestige building” publication.

Now there are many who feel that any device.

which makes an education palatable cheapens it. I
cannot see the harm in dramatizing a subject by
‘means of a humorous, lively, and well-delivered
lecture. Nor can I see the “obvious” superiority of
sourcebook learning to textbook learning.

Rather, I can see great advantages to the meth-
od practiced at Pitt. A novice confronted with a
multiplicityof source references may get bogged
down enough in a volume of reading, from which
he is to extract the relevant points, as to lose total
perspective of his subject. O ””

The thoughtful reader of a text-book can rea-
lize when the author is stating a polemic and can
take issue in class, but he is not forced constant-
ly -to‘ evaluate a‘ tremendous mass of ‘outdated
trivia. One ﬁne textbook I use ‘prints critical views
of its own theories, and so labels them.

I feel the exercise of, deciding -why these views
are in conflict, is more realistic to the undergrad-
uate than that of deciding which of several un-
labeled views is in accord with the latest develop-
ments in the field.

I must praise Pitt for making the greatest effdrt
to educate its undergraduates. Because here I am

able to grasp the total picture of what I am learn-_‘

ing, it is to me of much greater meaning.

«Student Trainee Plan

In Library Work Open

B-y LOIS DIAMOND

   

/

""AA.AlAA.AA.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.‘

The University

of Pittsburgh Library began a trainee
' program two years ago. Six trainees are now on the stall, and
another will be added in July. 9 ‘

Planning to become librarians, these

college, graduates

either do not have enough money to’ go on for the ﬁfth year
‘required in library science, or feel that practical work would
enrich their curriculum in library school. ‘

The University plan enables_ trainees to work full time

— in various departmentsof the li-9

‘brary and to attend the Carnegie
Institute of Technology 'Library
School, for one-third time. "
After three yearsgvthe trainees
receive a master’s degree in li-
brary science and will have had
three years of practical experi-
ence. Therefore, they will---earn
the pay of experienced profes-
sional librarians, which is con-
siderably more than the mini-
mum salary of novices. 2
A It is the hope of the library that

trainees continue here after se-
curing their degree. However, be-
cause there are 10,000 professional
librarians in the United States, it
is understandable if trainees go to
other cities where ‘salaries ,. are
higher than in Pittsburgh.

There is reciprocation because
trainees from other institutions
gravitate to Pittsburgh for various

reasons to become part of the’

staﬁ-of the University library.
The current trainees are Wil-
bur Stewart and Harvey Klein-
man, graduates of the Univer-
sity; Suzanne Kissane, graduate
of Rosemont College; George
Brugera, graduate of the Uni-
versity of Paris; Martha Seeber,
graduate ‘of the University ‘of-
California; and Brigette'Josephy
from Zurich, Switzerland.
The University library staff
feels that in recruiting librarians

' a service is being ‘done for the

profession at large. Trainees "can
apply to begin work ‘July 1.
Any student interested in li-
brarianship as a career is free- to
discuss details ‘with Miss Garloch
in room 528. To determine if they
have an interest in librarianship,

underclassmen can apply for stu-

dent librarian assistantships for
this summer ornext fall.

' HOW TO BE A s  
THUMPING BIG‘ SUCCESS ON CAMPUS

‘ \Vhile up in the attic last Week hiding from the tax man, I came
across a letter, yellow with age, that dear old Dad had sent. me
when I was a freshman. Ireproduce it below in the hope that
it may light your way as it did mine.

“Dear Son, (Dad always called me Son. This was short for
Sonnenberg, which used to be my first name." I tx':uler.l it last
year with a man named Max. He threw. in two ouﬁlr-lilor.< and
a left-handed pitcher .  But I digress.)

.“Dear Son, (Dad wrote)

“I suppose you are ﬁnding college very big and bewildering,
and maybe a little frightening too. Well, it need not be that way
if you will follow a. few simple rules. 0

“First of all, if you have any problems, take them to your
teachers. They want to help you. That’s what they are there for.
Perhaps they seem a little aloof , but that is only because they
are so busy. You will find your teachers warm as toast ahrl
friendly as pups if you will call on them at an hour when they
are not overly busy. Four a.m., for instance.

"Second, learn to budget your time. What. with classes, activi-
ties, studying, and sociallife all competing ‘for your time, it is
easy to fall into sloppy habits. Set» up a rigid schedule and stick
to it. Remember,‘ there are only 24 hours a day. '_l‘hrce of these
hours must be spent. in class. For every hour in class you rnust,
of course, spend two hours s.tud_ving, So there go six more
hours; Then, as we all know, for every hour studying, you" must
spend two hours sleeping. This accounts for twelve more hours.
Then there are meals——three hours ‘each for breakfast and lunch,
four hours for dinner. Never forget, Sonnenrberg, you must

"chew each mouthful twelve hundred times. You show me a
backward student, and I’ll showyou a man who bolts his food. ~

“But. college is more than just sleeping, eating, and studying.
There are also many interesting activities which you must not
miss. You'll want to give at least three hours a day t-0 the campus
newspaper, and, of course, another three hours each to the
drznna-tic and music clubs. And let’s say a total of eight hours
daily to the stamp club, the debating club, and the foreign
alfairs club. '1 hen, of course, nine or ten hours for fencing and
bird-walkmg, and ‘another. ten or twelve for ceramics and three-
card monte. ‘

"Finally we come  the most importantjiart of each day--
what I call lhe Quiet lime.’ This is a. period in which you

_ renew yourself —— just relax and think great thoughts and smoke

Marlboro’ Cigarettes. Why Marlboro? Because they are the
natural complement to the active life. They have better ‘makin ’s’;
the ﬁlter ﬁlters; the ﬂavor is rich and mellow and a treat to the
tired; 3 b00l'1 90 the Spent, a safe harbor to the storxn-tossed.
That’s why.

“Well, Sonnenberg, I guess that's about all. Your kindly old-
mother sends her love. She has just ﬁnished putting up rather
a large batch of pic-.kles—-in fact, 350,000 jars, I told her that
with you -away at school, we would not need so many, but

\ kmdly old M other is such a creature of habit that, though I hit
‘be: quite hard several times, I could not dissuade her.
Keep ’em ﬂying,
- Dad.”

itters Set forDoubl\eheader

Cal Teachers

This Saturday  
By LARRY HAGGERTY
‘A doubleheader with Cali-

fornia State Teachers College

at California, Pa., this Satur-

day willbring Coach Bobby

» Lewis"Panther nine closer to

home. The ﬁrst game will get

underway at 1:30 p.m. The Panth-
ers -opened their season last Fri-

day at Virginia.

‘Lewis plans to start Co-captain
Bill Hamilton in the ﬁrst tilt and
then comback with Bob Conti in
the nightcap. The Jungle Cats
trimmed. the Teachers, '6-5, in
last season.
The California coach is __ Andy
Sepsi Sr., father of Panther foot-
ball player, Andy Sepsi--Jr.

iThe probable starting lineup
for the Panthers shows Co—cap-

tain Fred DeLcst behind the
plate, Ron Maser at ﬁrst, Pete

Colangelo at second, George

Schocppner at short, and either

Pat Bonacci or Jerry Matulevic
‘at the hot corner.

_In the outﬁeld will’ be Nick
Kartsonas in left, Bill Kaliden in
center and Paul Stolitza in right.
Both Kaliden and Stolitza were
members of .John Michelosen’s
football. team last year.

“Kaliden,” Lewis said, “has had

to take a lot of joking ‘about’

the way we travel on our trips as
compared to the way the football
‘team traveled. While-the gridders
travel by air only, we poor mit-
ters must use out-of-date buses
on our trips." -

A three-run triple by Herb
Busch, :1. 6-8 relief pitcher, broke
up a 4-4_ deadlock in the eighth
inniugand gave the University
of Virginia at '7-4 triumph over
the Panthers at Charlottesville
last Friday afternoon.

John Reichenbach-, whose two-
run homer in the seventh with
DeL_ost aboard had put the Panth-
ers back into the ball game, was
charged with the d_efeat'when.he
served Busch his triple. He had
relieved Hamilton in the ﬁfth
i'nning.\ .

Hmiilton worked the ﬁrst
four frames; against the Cavi-
liers and gave up four runs on

a five hits. . He struck out two but
also issued ﬁve ‘walks. “Bill
had some stiﬁness in his right
shouider due to lack of work

"and ' that is probably why he

wa.sn’t too effective,” Lewis
stated about his ace mounds-
man. '

-Rain and wet grounds caused
postponement of two of the three
games _during last week’s road
trip. Last Thursday the game with
the Quantico Marines was rained
out ‘as was Saturday’s tilt with
