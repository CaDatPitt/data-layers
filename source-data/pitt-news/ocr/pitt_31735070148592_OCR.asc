Lauren Butler, a graphic designer

She has more than $70,000 in stu-

as a graphic designer does not cor-
relate withthe amount of debt she
has accumulated.

These are some of thefaces of
Occupy Pittsburgh. On Saturday, a
few thousand protesters marched
Downtown to stand against corpo-
rate greed, social injustices and the
disparities between the rich and poor.

The eclectic group of protesters has
no leaders, and they have not set a

The Occupy Pittsburgh movement
is an off—shoot of Occupy Wall Street,
a protest that has captured national
attention for nearly a month. More
than 1,500 cities have created their
own movements worldwide.

Meredith McNair, a Pitt sopho-
more and urban studies major who
attended the protest, said she be-
lieves that a key issue for protesters
is the way that large corporations
can buy legislation while the average
person cannot. ’ y A

“I feel like the Occupy move-
ment is along overdue movement

Nair said.

The rally began with a city—per-

Pennsylvania has popped up on the

Republican presidential political T

map as the site ‘of one of Repub-
lican candidate and Texas Gov.

Rick Perry’s ﬁrst policy speeches ‘

focusing on jobs and environmen-
tal regulation.

Less than a week after a visit
to Pittsburgh by President Ba-
rack Obama that focused on his
Americanjobs Act, Perry’s speech
in West Mifﬂin, Pa., highlighted a
series of his proposals that he said
would create more than 1 million
jobs and break American depen-
dence on foreign oil, should he be
elected president. ‘

Plant in West Mifflin, Perry un-
veiled a plan that would focus on
a series of executive orders meant
to “make what Americans buy, buy
What Americans make, and sell it
to the world.”

Perry, who joined the race in
August, said that, if elected, his
four—part plan can be put in mo-
tion within the ﬁrst 100 days of his
presidency. The plan would help
the 14 million American that are
unemployed, he said. ‘

The main aspects o_flPerry’s
plan include breaking America’s

Hillman Library upgrades John Woodruff medal display

Phil Aitken 8: Amy Friedenberger
The Pitt News Staff

On Aug. 4, 1936, John Woodruff
became the first African—Ameri~
can to awin a gold medal in the
Berlin Olympic Games, a slap in
the face to Adolf Hitler.

During the 800-meter ﬁnal,
other runners boxed Woodruff
in and forced hinito stop in his
tracks. After halting in the middle
of the race, he caught up with and
passed all the other runners. The
symbol of his accomplishment is
now memorialized in a display
more than 6 feet high in Hillman
Library.

Vice Chancellor of Public Af-
fairs Robert Hill and the director
of the University Library System
Rush Miller unveiled the medal at
an event on Friday. The African
American Alumni Council spon-
sored the display.

Woodruff died on Oct. 30,
2007, at the age of 92.

nated his gold medal to Pitt in
1990. It was originally hung in
a frame bolted on the wall of the
library’s ground ﬂoor. Miller said
that Woodruff insisted that his
medal have_a minimal display,
but Miller thought -it deserved

' better. A 7  .

“I thought it was inadequate,_”
Miller said. “I feel like this is a
more ﬁtting tribute than a frame
and some pictures.”

The current display in the ﬁrst
ﬂoor lobby features a case that ro-
tates the medal and an interactive
touchscreen describing Wood-
ruff ’s life and achievements. The
medal, which is made of nearly
pure gold, is valued at more than
$250,000.

Woodruff came to Pitt in 1936
and earned a bachelor’s degree in
sociology in 1939. In his freshman
year, Woodruff was selected to
join the U.S. Olympic team. De-
spite discussion of boycotting
the Olympics because the Nazi
Party controlled Germany, the
U.S. decided to attend. It was

Adolf Hitler’s theory of Aryan
race superiority by winning his
track event.

Before his Olympic debut,
Woodruff set track records at
Connellsville High School as
well as county, district and state
records. He came to Pitt on an
athletic scholarship.

Among those who spoke at
the unveiling was Woodruff’s
son,_]ohn Woodruff]r., who joked
that his greatest achievement was
being John Woodruff’s son. He
encouraged athletes in atten-
dance to be determined, a value
he learned from his father.

< Before the unveiling, Woodruff
Jr. said that the rest of his family,
particularly his mother, would
have liked to have been able to
come to Pitt for the occasion.
“We all thank you for honoring

“It was the beginning of a
friendship important to me,” he
said. -

In 2006, Nordenberg traveled

to Woodruff’s Fountain Hills,

back to Pitt to celebrate the 70th
anniversary of his victory, but
health reasons prevented him
from making the long-distance
trip. Woodruff lost both of his
legs due to poor circulation, but
he visited a year later during the
2006 Homecoming weekend. ,

According to Nordenberg,
Woodruff said, “There are worse
things than dying in Pitts-
burgh.” ’

Miller said that security of the

who had been Woodruff-’s friend
since-he was 18 "years old, said
that the two of them had a close
relationship. l

“He used to worry-about me
like he was my brother,” Douglas
said.

Pitt alumnus Roger Kingdom,

the 1984 and 1988 sprint hurdler
Olympic gold medalist, said he
had “renewed inspiration” when
he would listen to Woodruff speak
in public. ‘

“What I learned from him, I

he said. I

from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. The protesters
used signs, drums, megaphones and
chants to get their point across. .
After the rally, participants
marched to an occupation camp-

numbers had dwindled throughout
the day, did not have a permit for the

lon allowed them to stay at the site.
“‘We need to come together and
talk to each other,” local Occupy
Pittsburgh organizer Patrick Young
said. “We need to share ideas, listen
to each other, and hopefully we’re
goingto ﬁgure a way out of this mess
together.”
The people involved with Occupy

Pittsburgh have been meetingforthe g

past fewweeks to ﬁnalize the group’s
mission statement and plan for Sat-
urday’s demonstration. Not everyone

_ can clearly articulate whylthey are _
.‘.invQlved or what exactly they want, ,
: -but everyone agrees thefway the

economy is working right now does
not work for them. '
V ' Tayﬁm Gol, an Occupy Pittsburgh

organizer and member of the Party '

for Socialism and Liberation, said he
was very excited about thepotential
of the movement.

“This movement is about the
working class ﬁnally saying, ‘enough
is enough,’” he said. “I’m hoping this
will cause health care for all, educa-
_tion.for all, a job for alland everyone

. will'getalivingwage.”.- ‘

 

Andrew Wagner, a member of the

' Workers International League, stood

byatable distributing socialist litera-
ture, buttons and T—shirts promoting
the downfall of capitalism. ’

“Neither political party is rep-
resenting our needs,” he said. “The
corporations have basically bought
and sold our government.”

Wagner said that in order to ﬁx
this issue, capitalism. must be over-
thrown and the workers must insti-
Uute a plarmed economy led by demo-
cratically elected workers councils.

“I think the underlying problem

. "for all these issues is capitalism, and

I think we need to start building a
movementto overthrow capitalism,”

 Wagnersaid. “I think people need to

start moving in the directionofbuild—
ing a social society [with] a planned

economy where we can rationally ‘

allocate our resources.”

On the flipside of the ideological
coin, libertarians were out in support
of Occupy Pittsburgh as well.

Ryan Smith, an economics ma-
jor at Grove City College, said that
he believes the real problem is the
government.

“Peoplehere are angry, but they’re

not angry at the right thing,” Smith

said as he lowered his sign admon-
ishing the Federal Reserve to reveal
a Ron Paul T—Shirt. “They should be

« angry at the government and the

partnership with big business, not
big business itself. I’m here because

of an enthusiasm for liberty.”

The police at the kick—ofF rally
did not seem concerned about the
possibility of disruptive and illegal
activity.

“As long as things are done within
the law, we’re ﬁne with it,” said Lt.
Ed Trapp, the Tactical Operations

 

mp atMel|on Green

Commander in charge of the street.
“Based on what we’ve seen today,
we’re not worried.” 

John Murphy, an organizerfor the
location of Occupy Pittsburgh, said
that about 40 people with makeshiﬁ
shelters were willing to camp out as
long as it took to make change and
that 20 more would be arriving on
Sunday.

“In my entire life, I’ve never seen
such a broad base of people, stand-
ing together, chanting together and
marching together,” Murphy said.-

Gov. Rick Perry delivers

  first major policy speech

Steve Garﬁnkel I Assistant Vial Eit

Texas Gov. Rick Perry spoke at the U.S. Steel Mon Valley Works—Irvin Plant in West
Mifflin, Pa.,' about his plans to create jobs and break from foreign oil dependency.

Perry 4 1

“We’re creating foreign jobs, we’re cre-

? atingjforeign proﬁts,” he said. “It’s wrong,

hypocritical and unfair.”
, Perry said that the U.S. has untapped

"supplies of coal, oil and natural gas that
A ' Obama and the “overreaching environmental

agency,” the EPA, won’t allow America to
draw on. V
‘ ‘‘America should not and will not be,
when I’m elected, be held hostage by foreign
oil and foreign bureaucrats,” he said.
Perry said he wants to take concrete
actions to open oil and gas ﬁelds that are
currently off-limits by writing a series of
executive orders to open up Alaska’s natural
resources to create 120,000 jobs, initiate

 offshore exploration to create 55,000 jobs,
’ resume exploration in the Gulf of Mexico to

create 230,000 jobs and build the Keystone
XL Pipeline to create 20,000 jobs.
He said natural gas exploration is a

“game-changer” that will create jobs and '

reduce energy costs. In Pennsylvania there
is the possibility of creating 250,000 jobs

through tapping the full potential of Marcel-
lus Shale, he said.

“Western Pennsylvania is known for pro-
ducing some pretty great quarterbacks,”
Perry said. “And I want Western Pennsylva-
nia to quarterback a new revolution.”

He criticized Obama’s jobs proposal,
which the president spoke about on a visit to
Pittsburgh earlier this week, saying that his
administration is doing behind—the—scenes
work to “grind the economy to a halt” by
destroying American jobs through EPA reso-
lutions and regulations.

Perry said that if the Obama administra-
tion has its way, 2.4 million jobs will be lost
on the oil, coal and gas industries.

He also accused Obama of purposely rais-
ing the price of electricity, making it more
costly to drive consumers toward green en-
ergy. But America doesn’t produce enough
green energy to cover all of that, so-the re-
sult isincreased dependence on foreign oil,
Perry said.

Choosing between the environment and
the economy should not be the only option,
he said. A 1

Perry also said that states need to have
more say in what goes on in their environ-
ments and that the federal government can-
not have a “one-size-ﬁts-all” mentality about
environmental regulations.

“I reject the notion that Washington is
more committed to energy stewardship than
the state and local officials who have to live
with the consequences,” he said.

Perry ended his speech by telling the
audience that they have two very different
choices in the 2012 election.

“Creating jobs in America is as simple as
changing presidents,” he said before walk-
ing out to the tune of Toby Keith’s “Made
in America.” I A »

EDITORIAL T

Intellectual

discussions still

abound on campus

If during any given lunch hour,
you were to eavesdrop on as
many Market Central conver-
sations as you could, the odds

A that any of them would concern
chaos theory or postmodernism ,

are astronoimicallylsmall. Con.-A

trary to the assertions of certain *

academics, however, on-campus
intellectual discourse is anything
but impoverished.

James’ M. Lang, an associate
professor of English.at Assump-
tion College, wrote a column
last Tuesday in The Chronicle of
Higher Education declaiming,
among other things, the state
of outside—the—c1assroom dis-
course. Independent, informed
student conversations, he says,
have diminished since his college
days; no longer do undergradu-
ates spend nights talking about
philosophy, literature or politics
in their dorm rooms.

Lang says he arrived at these
conclusions after reading two
books: “My Freshman Year: What
a Professor Learned by Becom-
ing a Student” by Cathy Small
(published under the pseudonym
Rebekah Nathan) and “My Word!:
Plagiarism and College Culture”
by Susan D. Blum. The former is
an account of the author’s one-

‘ year stint at Northern Arizona

University. The latter, while os-
tensibly centered on cheating,
examines many of the same sub-
jects. What both Small and Blum
conclude is that, in Small’s words,
“academic and intellectual pur-
suits  had a curiously distant
relation to college life.”
Although, in our experience,

 

it’s true that a large number of
Pitt students will eschew weighty
debates (insofar as.they can be
defined by-subject matter) in fa-

vor of everyday banter, _it’s also i V

truevthat opportunities abound

1 fforé:_the intellectually inclined to ' ‘

engage their peers.Joining a phi-
losophy club, for instance, will
not only guarantee an hour or
two of stimulating discussions, it

' will also introduce you to a net-

work of people willing to have
such conversations outside a for-
malized setting. Enrolling in an
honors course, as well, is bound
to land you in the company of
genuine intellectuals.

Of course, it’s impossible to
gauge with "anything other than
anecdotal evidence whether
on-campus intellectual life has
actually declined. We suspect,
however, that professors like
Lang associated with particu-
larly brainy circles during their
undergraduate years — circles
as uncommon then as they are
now. Many of us at The Pitt News
travel in similar crowds, and thus
find his eulogizing of intelligent
discourse premature.

Because hebelieves out-of-
class dialogue has lessened, at
the‘ end of his op-ed Lang com-
mits to intensifying the intel-

, lectual rigor of his courses as a

counterbalance. This is an ad-
mirable objective. But he and his
colleagues should realize that, in
spite of a seemingly pervasive
disregard for humanistic inqui-
ry, on-campus intellectual life
is alive and well, albeit among a
select group of people. 4

 

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Republicans were wise to

reject Obama’s obs bil    

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

Last Tuesday, Pittsburgh played
host to the latest Big Speech from
the president and, like some ofhis
previous speeches, it had very little
effect._ .

The Senate just voted to kill
President Obama’s $447 billion
jobs bill, and already we’re hearing
the usual accusations from both
parties. Democrats say Republi-
cans are mean-spirited and want
the economy to remain in the toilet
until Nov. 7, 2012, the day afterithe
presidential election. Republicans
say Democrats deliberately pre-
sented a lousy bill to put them in

the untenable position of either
voting for it and getting ﬂayed alive
by their base or voting against it
and apparently voting in favor of
bread lines. We haven’t heard the
last of this, believe me.

Why did the Republicans op-
pose this bill? Well, for one thing,
it’s diﬂicult to believe that it will
achieve its objectives when we

. consider how the last bill that

was all about jobs turned out. The
American Recovery and Reinvest-
ment Act of 2009 committed the
federal government to spending
$787 billion and according to re-
covery.gov, as of October 7, $720.1
billion of that money had already
been paid out.

Congressional newspaper The

MCT Campus

Hill reminds us that President
Obama said that if the Act was
passed, unemployment would not
go above 8 percent Also, the Coun-
cil of Economic Advisers said that
without the bill, unemployment
might reach a high of 9 percent.
And yet, according to the Labor
Department, there are actually
1.5 million fewer people employed
today as compared to when the
bill was passed in February 2009.
Unemployment stands at 9.1 per-
cent, above the high the Council
of Economic Advisers predicted
in the case of no stimulus.
Even.-worse, despite the fact
that we were assured during the
last stimulus cycle that the money

Kozlowski < 5

would go to “shovel—ready proj-
ects,” President Obama himself
admittedithat no such jobs existed.
With stimulus spending over $787
billion and that money not accom-
plishing what it was supposed to
accomplish, why are we to believe
that the infusion of another $447
billion is going to work wonders
for the economy? Even members
of the president’s own party don’t
think the bill will help much. Two
Democratic senators, Ben Nelson
andjon Tester, even went so far as
to break with their party and join a
Republican ﬁlibuster against it.
Furthermore, the bill would
have placed regulatory burdens
on the recipients of its funds-.
Section 4 of the American Jobs

Act requires that all iron, steel.
and manufactured goods used‘

in projects funded by the bill be
American-made, except in cases
where the head of an involved fed-
eral department rules otherwise,
either because doing so would be
too expensive or the American
goods aren’t of sufficient quality.
This would be a hassle for com-
panies involved in the program,

particularly because it is hard to

determine what “American- made”
really means since supply chains
are immensely complicated. For.
example, if you very literally read
this provision, a ﬁrm couldn’t buy
a Boeing Dreamliner, which is as-
sembled in the U.S., because alot of

its components are made outside V A
the country. The ability of federal v

bureaucrats to grant waiversinight
also lead to uncertainty —- isthe

waiver goingto be granted? — as_

well as an incentive to spend more I
time evading.regulations than cre-
ating jobs.

""“— ‘5 “-5
The defeat of the

billalso makes the.

presidenilook very

    

I   bad politically.

 ss\     

Finally, regardless of the real i

possibility that the bill wouldn’t
accomplish anything, it wouldn’t
have been politically smartfor Re-
publicans to have backed it. This is
more nuanced than “Republicans
want the economy to suck until
the elections.” In fact, the Repub-
licans would like nothing better
than for the economy to get better
... provided that they can take the
credit. Seeing.a break in the Demo-
cratic Party ranks and realizing
that a lot of the proposals in the
jobs bill are palatable, the Repub-
licans might be hoping to work out
some kind of deal directly with the
Democratic leadership on Capitol
‘Hill and cutthe WhiteHouse:out-
entirely. The Republicans already
managed something similar during
the debate over the deﬁcit reduc-

rs doom bill

tion bill, and likely see no reason
why something similar couldn’t be
accomplished on jobs.-The defeat
of the bill also makes the presi-
dent look very bad politically. He
comes out and gives a speech to a
joint session of Congress. He’s_run-

jning around the country pressing '
I for ‘this bill, and members of his

own party oppose the.1egislation
publicly. If you’re a Republican,
this is a very bad time to hand the

president the political victory of

a passed bill..

. So another piece of legislation
has bitten the dust. Nowjwe just
have to see -what kind of spin gets
placed on it, and-what kind of spin

the American people ultimately.

College students shouldwelcome indecision

Kelan Lyons

From choosing which high—calorie

How prevalent is it? Dr. Fritz
Grupe, founder of MyMajors.com,
told MSNBC that about 50 percent
of students change their major at
least once during their undergradu-
ate tenure. It’s exceedingly rare that
freshmen who go into college with

learn to become comfortable with
unpredictability, as it will inevitably
creep into our lives and eat us alive
if we don’t welcome it with open
arms. Life would be no fun if we
were able to guess exactly where we
were going to be in 10 years.

Part of the blame for our inabil-
ity to tolerate uncertainty lies with
our parents. From birth we were
told that we were special and gifted
in ways everyone else wasn’t. As a
result, we began believing we were
better than our peers and wouldn’t
succumb to the trials and tribula-
tions they so often experienced.
This turned out to be completely
untrue. Regardless of whether

When Bernadette Spinella checked

The University did call back,
but it wasn’t to ask for money.
Spinella was one of 16 ran-

attend a dinner at the University

had the opportunity to meet and

Pitt’ s offensecontinues to struggle

Sean Corrado
Staff Writer

Pitt football quarterbacks showed
some consistency against Utah
— consistency in putting up poor
statistics next to their names.
But the Panthers’ second
straight loss produced more than
a few questions for the offense:
Who can take command at the
quarterback position‘? What hap-
pened to the Panthers who played
South Florida? Can the offensive
line ever get it back together?‘
The quarterbacks" combined
for a dismal, to say the least,
performance against the‘Ut.es,
but they aren’t the only players
to blame. 
Tino Sunseri and backup
quarterback Trey Andersfgn
are certainly the most vi_sil§fle
members of the off'ense,lbut_t:h1e
rest of the offense should also
shoulder some of the blame for
Pitt’s struggles, particularly the
offensive line‘. “ " . ""“

!U("

Sunseri has been sacked a
nation-leading 32 times this sea-
son.Johnny McEntee from Con-
necticut is second with 21 sacks.
No one can deny that Sunseri is
clearly struggling and not mak-
ing decisions quickly enough or
throwing the Hall away when nec-
essary — two areas heseemed
to show improvement in against
South Florida.

But he’s been sacked 11 more
times than McEntee and that
shows that not only is he not get-
ting the ball out in time, but he’s
also not getting the protection he
needs to make good decisions.

Pitt’s wide receivers have
seemingly disappeared as well,
especially against Utah, where
freshman Ronaldjones led all Pitt
receivers with just 16 yards.

Pitt’s quarterback struggles
don’t just point to a problem with
one position, but they reveal
somethingwrong with the. of-
fense as .3-whole. Pitt head'fcoach
Todd Grgham said that the;P,an-
thers’ offense “doesn’t looklike

Utah.

a system at all.”

With ﬁve games remaining in
the season, Pitt had better figure
it out soon.

Sunseri — who Graham said
still gives Pitt the best chance
to win — finished 4-11 for 38’
yards against Utah. During the
fourth quarter, Sunseri also lost
a fumble inside the Panthers’ own
20-yard line.

Graham \ inserted backup
quarterback Trey Anderson into --
the game and the true freshman
played most of the third and
fourth quarters. Even though
Anderson received more snaps,
the results from the quarterback
positionvdidn’t change. 

, Anderson tried to compete
with Sunseri’s numbers, complet-
ing ﬁve passes on 19 attempts for
a total of 12 yards and twointer-
ceptions. While Sunseri strug-
gled to get the ball off+ getting
sacked five times in the process'»
— Anderson consistently missed
open receivers.

-»A pair of special teams touchdowns in the

ﬁrst quarter couldn’t carry the Pitt football
team Saturday as Utah quickly overtook the
Panthers’ meager offense for a 26-14 win.

Utah scored 23 unanswered points and
grabbed two late interceptions to defeat
the Panthers at Heinz Field after falling
behind 14-3 in the ﬁrst quarter.

After a 44-point performance against
South Florida, Pitt’s offense has only scored
one touchdown over the past two games,
causing the Panthers to pick up consecutive
losses to Rutgers and Utah despite solid

' -performances from their defense and spe-

cial teams. _

On Saturday, Pitt’s offense didn’t reach
the red zone or score a point in the game as
special teams scored both Panther touch-
downs. The team ﬁnished with a total of
120 offensive yards.

‘-‘We absolutely did not execute anything
in the passing game at all,” Pitt head coach
Todd Graham said. He called the loss to
Utah (2-3, 0-3 Pac-12) an “absolutely dismal
performance” by the offense.

In the ﬁrst quarter, Buddy Jackson re-

turned a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown
and Antvvuan Reed returned a blocked punt
from Andrew Taglianetti for 10 yards into
the end zone to make the score 14—3.The
Panthers (3-4, 1-1 BigiEast) didn’t score
again.

Graham said he thought the Panthers
learned to effectively execute his no-huddle
system in their 44-17 victory over South
Florida on Sept. 29..But whatever strides

Pitt made_ offensively against the Bulls were . '

erased in a 34-10 loss to Rutgers last week
and Saturday’s defeat.
“To go from 500 yards of offense [versus

. South Florida] to 120 yards today, I didn’t

think that was possible,” Graham said.

Graham said the Panthers showed that
they can effectively execute the system in
their game against South Florida.

“It.’s [the coaches’] job to teach the sys-
tem and. obviously we’re not doing that,”
Graham said. “It doesn’t look like a system
at all.” '

Sunseri, Anderson split
time at quarterback  

Utah 4 8

Panthers in the game, ﬁnishing with 17

tackles for loss. Pitt defensive tackle Chas

Alecxih said it can be frustrating for the
defense to play well and then watch the
offense struggle.

Sunseri and Anderson went a combined

A 9-30 with two interceptions, and were

sacked six times. Pitt’s quarterbacks were
unavailable for comment after the game.

Running back Ray Graham, the nation’s
leading rusher entering the game, carried
the ball 12 times for 46 yards.

“I._kind of; got frustrated out there,”
Graham said-.;“Every way I wanted to go,
somebody was there.” 4 '

Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham said
the Utes took the run away from Graham
by “gang-tackling him.”

“You have to be able to hold up on the
outside and cut corners and we didn’t give
up much in the throw game  you have to
cover and do things correctly in the second-
ary and we did that,” he said.

Utah right end Derrick Shelby said the
team knew it had to limit Ray Graham com-
ing in. 1

“The last couple of weeks, we have been
kind of coming out of a lull with turnovers
and things like that,” Shelby said. “This
week we wanted to show that [we] could
ﬁght the whole way through. We had a game
plan and we believed in it.”

Both Anderson and Sunseri saw time in
Saturday’s game, with the backup Anderson
playing the majority of the third and fourth
quarters. Todd Graham said the ﬁrst time
Anderson entered the game early in the
first quarter was planned.

After that, Graham was just looking for
a way to jump-start the offense.

“We put [Anderson] back in the second
half just trying to get something going at
all,” Graham said. “Obviously neither quar-
terback played very good at all. Very, very
bad offensive performance.”

Whittingham credited his defense for
the win.

“They played hard from start to ﬁnish
[and] they played smart and did very good

things,” he said. “We have a lot of work to

do on offense ‘and that is very evident.” -

Utah ﬁnished with 251 total yards. Quar-
terbackjon Hays completed 14 of 23 passes
for 127 yards and a touchdown. John White
led the Utes on the ground with 185 yards
on 35 carries.

Both the Panther defense and the special
teams played well enough for the Panthers
to win, something Graham acknowledged
in the postgame press conference.

“The things we accomplished defen-
sively no one is really noticing because of
how bad we are playing offensively the last
two weeks,” he said.

Utah scored on its ﬁrst drive after White
rushed for 21 yards to the Pitt 4—yard line.
The Utes couldn’t get into the end zone,
but Coleman Petersen made a 23-yard ﬁeld
goal to put Utah ahead 3-0.

Pitt answered when Jackson returned
the kickoff for a touchdown. It was the ﬁrst
kickoff Pitt returned for a touchdown since
Lowell Robinson ran one back on Oct. 13,
2006. n

Taglianetti blocked the punt that led to
Pitt’s second touchdown after Utah’s next
drive. The Panthers haven’t blocked a punt
and returned it for a touchdown since Sept.
28, 1991, when Billy Davis returned a punt
for 13 yards.

The Utes made a 34-yard ﬁeld goal with
3:15 left in the second quarter. Then, with

2:07 remaining in the half, Utah quarter- -

back Jon Hays found Luke Matthews for
a 33-yard touchdown, despite being hur-
ried by Pitt outside linebacker Brandon
Lindsey.

On the ﬁrst drive of the second half,
Utah used a'37-yard John White run to set
up a 39-yard ﬁeld goal to take a 16-13 lead.
Petersen added a 45-yard ﬁeld goal in the

- fourth quarter.

Late in the fourth quarter, Shelby inter-
cepted Anderson and returned the ball 23
yards for a touchdown to make the score
26-14 and seal the victory for Utah.

Conroy Black intercepted Anderson

again on Pitt’s ﬁnal possession of the
‘game. ~

Todd Graham said he expects injured
outside linebacker Todd Thomas and right

i guard Lucas Nix to return next game.

Taglianetti said that although the game
was frustrating, the Panthers can’t dwell

P on the loss.

“We have to bounce back,” he said. “We
have ﬁve conference games left and those
are the big ones. We need to focusgup and

come back and ﬁnish strong.” ﬂ

who their favorite Pitt player of all time
was. One gentleman said Billy Knight, who
has his jersey retired. One story was about
thejerome Lane dunk. The gentleman said
it was the loudest the gym has ever been

» « —— ever.”

Spinella, who was elated to ﬁnd herself
seated next to head coach Jamie Dixon,
said the opportunity to talk to the players
was exciting — even if her knowledge of
Pitt basketball reached back before they
were born.

“We brought up the names of a few
former players, but they didn’t remember
them because it went too far back,” she said.
“But talking to [assistant coach] Brandin
Knight, he was a little more knowledgeable
of the players I brought up. [The players]

‘ =4 were all wonderful. They were all very po-

lite —— very nice, tall boys.” _

When the food was gone, Dixon stood
up and introduced each player individually.
The players then offered the fans seated at
their respective tables their 2011 season
tickets and a handshake.

Senior guard Ashton Gibbs described
the experience as humbling.

“It just reminds us of the fan support we
have here,” Gibbs said. “That was one of
the reasons I came to Pittsburgh, actually.
The fans, the atmosphere, the Oakland

Zoo — it’s crazy. You’ve got season-ticket
holders here that, talking to them, they’re
the same way.”

Dixon said the team wanted to do some-
thing special for “the random fans” that
attendpevery game.

“We wanted to thank them for all of their
support,” Dixon said. “It’s unique because
it’s not like this anywhere else. Sometimes,
locally, we forget it. Nationally, they under-

.stand the crowds, and they see that not a lot
of places are as enthusiastic as ours.”

Pederson said he came up with the
idea while discussing the distribution of
season tickets a couple of months ago. He
said that dinner seemed like a fun way for
season-ticket holders to communicate on
a personal level with the players.

“In sports, a lot of times, you have these
great fans who come to games. Of course, in
the case of the Petersen Events Center, it’s
sold out every game,” Pederson said.

Pitt has sold out 161 consecutive games
at the Petersen Events Center. -The season
ticket waiting list now has 9,000 member
up from last year’s 6,000. '

“And yet, sometimes those fans don’t
have a chance to meet and see the guys in
person that they’re there to watch,” Peder-
son added. “So this was really a way for fans
to get a chance to interact with players.”ﬂ

Panthers missing two
offensive linemen

Offense < 7

a pick thrown to Utah’s Derrick Shelby

for a return touchdown late in the fourth 0

quarter, sealed the game for the Utes.
Utah came into the game with a 2-3 re-
cord (0-3 Pac-12) while struggling to hold
offenses under 30 points in October. How-
ever, the Utes completely dismantled all
aspects of Pitt’s supposedly high-octane
offense, as the Panthers produced no of-

fensive points.

Sunseri and Anderson were sacked a
total of six times. The Utes‘ even swarmed

Pitt star running back Ray Graham every ‘

time he touched the ball, and he managed
just 12 carries for 46 yards.
Last week, Todd Graham said ofthe of-

fense versus South Florida, “Whoever we
hadat quarterback, the way we protected
him, he was not going to be successful.”

The‘ sameseemed true this week.

It doesn’t help that the offensive line is
currently missing two of its most produc-
tive‘ and experienced offensive linemen.

Redshirt senior Chris Jacobson is out
for the year with a knee injury, while se-
nior Lucas Nix missed the games against
Rutgers and Utah, also with a knee in-
jury. Nix is expected to return for the

' Panthers’ game against Connecticut next

week, which should help the line’s overall
performance. . .

Protection has to be a key goal for
the offense in order to turn this season
around. After the game, Ray Graham ac-
knowledged that Utah’s defensive game
planrmade moving the football difficult
for the Panthers. 4

But when asked what the Pitt offense

could do to improve itself, Graham said
that all of the offensive players needed
to work in order to give the quarterbacks
more time. _ l V 1

Still, the quarterbacks certainly need
to make major improvements as well. Sun-
seri needs to return tohis performance
against South Florida and make quick
decisions while throwing the ball away
when necessary.

Ifhe does that, Todd Graham might be 0

right: Sunseri could give the Panthers the
best chance to win. I
