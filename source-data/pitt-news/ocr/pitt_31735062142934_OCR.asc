Student Congress elected its top men last Monday to take

5 overthe leadership of student activity at Pitt.’ The elections
“ themselves rate little "comment. Time will test their results.

The discussion ‘prior to elections, however, deserves consid-'

, erable mention. Arguments centered on the tendncy of,Pitt stu-
fdents—and students in every school and college_ in the na-
.tion——to shy away, from .anything that might taste of “Joe
A College.’’- - P S

Crux of all points ‘in the discussion was that the student,

1 whether he had a tour of duty in the service or not, has taken
‘\o‘i1 the G. I. attitude of a lot of gripes, but little action.

The cross section of Congress members, their past exper-

wicnce in service schools throughout the U. S., and the editorial
j columns of all Pitt News exchanges prove that this impression
" is general. 2 ' T

=l= It it

, But we wonder if the editorial writers, slick magazine

writers, and the members of Congress have noticed a gradual,
..though slight trend away from this “hell with everything”

attitude. ,,
Pitt’s Spring Festival can not be rated as a test of this
changed in feeling. It was something on a colossal scale. Stu-

("dents obtained much for little in the.way of expense or effort.
- Yet, the turnout was better than any recorded in the annals
-of Festival history. There must be a ‘reason. I

We have noticed, a trend in the News oﬁice toward the
inclusion of capable and interested veteranson our rolls. Ours
is ‘a’ specialized field, but the veteran addition is a -decided

active workers in the, fall term.'

1: ii it

Many ex-Gr.I.’s will have completed their ﬁrstyear in col-

[lege.in a few weeks. For the majority, it has been a long year

of little but hard work. We question whether they have gained

.a “full year’s education.” By way of grades, statistics proved

that the veteran student pulled down a high Q.P. average, but
little more. , 4 ‘ P
The combined statements of ten prominent educators,

after sessions with industrial and business leaders pointed out
that a Batchelor’s degree, even a high Q.P. average, were not

unusual. According to the educators’ thinking and the think-
ing of industrial placement heads—the men with a record of

-leadership in competitive ﬁelds are looked for. There is no
"better proving ground for this leadership ability than in or-
? ganized campus activities.

With this incentive, and the present trend in activities, we

i’ look for a decided increase in participation in activities next
fall. A summer is three months of thought; and three months

of grind. If there is no improvement to “the hell with every-

thing.” .

Editor, Pitt News:

. I was interested in your front
page article (May 13 issue) about
the drive to curb bad manners. In
the -ﬁrst place, just where is all
of this dignity which was men-
tioned. Everytime I tell ‘anyone I
am going to Pitt, he laughs atme.

And just what is this “undig-
niﬁed conduct” and “too affec-
tionate behavior’?? I suppose that
it means putting your arm around
a girl’s waist and holding her
hand in public, or, perish the
thought, kissing -her. _ '

As far as. some students em-
barrassing others, who are the
“others”? Who would be embar-
rassed, certainly not other stu-
dents! I imagine if anyone com-
plained,‘it would be because she
(or he) had no one with whom to
carry on a personal relationship.
That old green-eyed monster?

I, for one, say that the deans
can count on my “good taste”; af-
ter all, I don’t carry on public re-
lations with just any old co-ed.

Editor, Pitt News:

This week Dr. Dietze is a_d—
ministering tests to graduating
seniors in Soldiers and Sailors
memorial. These tests are known
around campus as “Senior Rec-
ord Examinations.” Dean Craw-
ford of the College says that any
senior who does not take the ex-
am will automatically be denied
the privilege (?) of graduating
from the University of Pittsburgh.

‘To one who had muddled or-

slaved through four » years of

to seniors announcing the exam-
inations, their purpose is to/.ob.-
tain an average of the universities
and colleges throughout the coun-
try and ﬁnd the‘ relative stand-
ing of each ifidividual institution.
In previous years, Pitt’s relative
standing has been; anything but
envious. .

Has President Bowman, Chan-
cellor Fitzgerald, or-Dean Craw-
ford done anything to improve this
relative standing? Has the cur-
riculum or teaching staff been
improved, and have any attempts
been made to raise the general
student level? Does the Admin‘-
istration believe that publication
of Pitt’s standing in the record
exams is favorably publicity?

In short, just what, if any, good
has come .of the record exams in
previous years? We, the seniors
who. must spend eleven valuable"
hours near the end of our college
careers taking the exams, would
like to know the answers to these
questions.

Jazz in Pittsburgh

Aside from the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony orchestra, Pittsburgh is a"

town noted as being sorely lacking

P in good instrumental music. Can-

sequently, it was a real pleasure
when I found some good creative
playing right in the heart of Pitts-

burgh‘. The music ,I’m talking;
about is not symphonic;‘it’s in an-.

other line, but, believe me, it’s
great. Tolrelieve any further sus-
pense I_hope to have created, the
music I’m talking about: is jazz.

For the last couple of years _I ll‘
had been frequenting a joint in'
town that has jazz that is really“

terriﬁc. In fact, every time I‘
hear this music it seems to get bet-

ter and better, as good things get. V

Last Friday I heard this stuff

again, and it _was so ﬁne that I’d A

like to tell everyone about it.

Creating this Amusic is..a small . _

combo, composed of a Asax, piano,’

drums, ‘and bass. They've played ‘

together in Pittsburgh quite a
while now with little outside no-
tice. except for those "few in con-

tact with, the Pittsburgh jazz.

world, which is sadly small. But,
last week one of the Pittsburgh
newspapers wrote up these men’

- as,th'e most expert’ jazz musicians

aroundtown. I know lots of'peo-
ple, including myself, who agree.

You Pittsburgh ‘Press Sunday
edition readers may have seen’
the articlejin last ' w,eek’s Roto
pictorial section called: Jam ‘Ses-

merly with Benny ‘Goodman and

ally a "swell guy; Joe Wallace,  I
. bass, player, and Pittsburgh‘ Sym- _

phony man; Reid Jaynes, pianist
formerly with Hal'McIntyre; and
Vic, Powell, 21 year-old alto sax
player were featured. These same
men are the music-ians I’ve been
raving about. 

The Roto gave.most of the dope
on the ‘men, except for one ‘very
important thing—where you can
hear them. Well, down on Liber-
ty avenue there’s an‘ obscure cafe,
called Miller’s,‘ a block down from

the Art Cinema, where these men

play everynight of the week, ex-
cept Sundays, of course. Also,
every Saturday afternoon at 2:30,

they have a jam session open top

‘anyone who wants to drop in to
listen. ‘

The men work together in some .

ﬁne instrumentals, among which
are such new tunes as Dizzy Gil-
lespie’s Night in.Tunisia, and some

new renditions of Yesterdays, Tea-

for Two, and practically any-
thing else that’s wonderful.

Darom
For Foto Club _
Opens Today

Climaxing two years of work
and planning, Pitt’s Foto club. dark
room was oﬁicially opened yester-
day for the use of members of
the club and campus publications
photographers.

Two years ago the Foto club was
organized at Pitt. At that time its
faculty sponsors and members be-
gan plans for a dark room in the
Cathedral. Under the direction of
T. M. Jarrett, University pho-
tographer, and Dr. G. M. McKin-
ley, student photographers devel-
oped their project.

The dark room also will accom-
modate Pitt News photographers,
enabling them to have spot cov-
erage on timely pictures. Under
the arrangement set up in the
room, pictures can be developed
in 30 to 45 minutes right here in
the University. -

Cost of the dark room will be
taken care of partly by the Foto
club and partly by various pub-
lications. Although the ‘room is
ready for use, other additions are
planned. _

Gene Shaffer, president of the
Foto club, Bernie Klein, vice
president, and Mervin Stewart,
program chairman, with the co-
operation of faculty sponsors
planned the details of the room.

«University entertained Madame
Tildy with‘ a luncheon in the
Twentieth Century club at which
Eleanor Kelly, Mabel Gillespie,
and Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell,
advisor to the nationality rooms,
were hostesses. Madame Tilby
spoke on the Hungarian women’s
relief organizations.

During her stay in Pittsburgh,
Madame Tildy conferred with
Hungarian, relief organizations
which have sent hundreds of tons
of food and clothing to the needy
in Europe. One of these organiza-
W tions, the Verhovay Aid society,
 has its national headquarters in
Pittsburgh.

Upon her arrival in the United
States, Madame Tildy’s ﬁrst
American hospitality was shown
at the White House by President
and Mrs. Truman. In Washington
she was the guest of the State de-

 

house for‘ ofﬁcial visitors.

Madame Tildy came to Pitts-
burgh from the east where she
was the guest of Mrs. Eleanor
Roosevelt, wife of the late presi-
dent. A" V -

For the Pittsburgh visit Madame
Tildy ‘was accompanied by Dr.

garian legation, and by her son-
in-law, Dr. Victor Csornoky.

Explosives—an essential
industrial tool ‘ .

NDUSTRIAL explosives are
as much of a yardstick
of industrial progress as sul-
furic acid. They are in-
volved in the fabrication of
nearly all the products used
by man. This year the
United States will use over
500 million pounds of in-

dustrial explosives.

The technical problems
that confront the explosives
industry are many and.va-

— ried. A measure of this is
the fact that the Du Pont
Company manufactures
about two hundred dyna-
mite formulations, each in-‘
tended to do a different job,

Studies in Laboratory and Field
One of the ﬁrst industrial laboratories
for chemical research in the United‘
States, the Eastern laboratory of the

eDu Pont Explosives Department has

nearly two hundred chemists, engineers,
physicists and assistants. There, meth-
ods have been developed for measuring
the power of explosives, the degree to
which they shatter or pulverize various
materials, their water resistance, their
safety characteristics when exposed to
shock or ﬂame, the composition of the
gases they produce, etc. As a result of
studies of the inﬂuence of various fac-

»tors on dynamite performance, it has

become possible to formulate an explo-
sive to meet practically any blasting
condition-

.,.In keeping with these improvements,
the application of explosives has reached
a new level of efficiency. Technical serv-
ice men, usually- mining engineers or

civil engineers, aid consumers in the
selection and use of explosives. They
also work closely with research men in

solving unusual problems encountered"

in the ﬁeld.

Research—Path to Progress

A few of the results gained through
research are: (1) lowering of dynamite
freezing points by _.nitrating ethylene
glycol along with glycerol to diminish
the hazards of thawing frozen dyna-
mites. (2) Production of less hazardous
dynamites by substituting ammonium
nitrate partially for nitroglycerine, in
spite of the greater hygroscopicity and
lesser explosive power of the former.
This resulted in dynamites less hazard-
ous to manufacture and use. (3) Intro-
duction of “Nitramon,” a blasting agent
containing a high percentage of ammo-

nium nitrate as its major ingredient. It _

is equal in strength to the most power-
ful dynamites commonly employed and
yet is by far the safest blasting agent

available. (4) Development of explo-

sives with a minimum of noxious gases
for use in conﬁned areas. (5) Numerous
improvements in the composition, man-
ufacture and design of the blasting
caps which set off the. main charge.

More facts about Du Pont-—LIsten to “Cavalcade of America," Mondays, 8 P. M. EDST, on NBC

Aside from these developments in
explosives and blasting supplies, there
have been many accomplishments in
chemistry and engineering associated
with such projects as the oxidation of
ammonia to nitric acid; manufacture,
granulation and drying of ammonium
nitrate; substitutes for nitroglycerine
and ethylene glycol dinitrate, concen-
tration of nitric and sulfuric acids, and
a host of other subjects.

places in the Oxford university
summer school. . A ’

‘A highest honor graduate of the
College in 1940, Miss Welfer re-

upon discharge from the Navy
where she served from 1943 to
1946 as a lieutenant .j.g. in the
supply corps.

Her course, a study of the West-
ern Civilization in the Twentieth
Century, covering the main trends
in European civilization in philos-
ophy, art, literature, education,
commerce, economics and science,
will be conducted in the tradition-
al Oxford manner.

There will be lectures on spe-

Much work will be done in
small groups under the guidance
of tutors drawn from the internal
and extra-mural staff of the uni-

K’/lawi ﬁll   '
av W o o o 0 0
by Allan Roth '

Last Tuesday afternoon as we began gleaning through sheets of
sports copy for today’s edition of the News, it came to our atten-
tion that something familiar wasn’t included among the sheaf of
white typewritten papers.

Baseball news which has well dominated our sports pages for
the last couple of months was conspicuous by its absence. We were
quite certain, but nevertheless we waded through the junk on the
sports desk, pulled out our wellﬁngered baseball schedule, and
nodded in assurance. The Pitt baseball season was over—no question
about it. ‘ _ - ,

Columns upon column of print in other college papers, which
reach us through our exchange system, tell of other schools just
beginning to get the feel of the baseball season. West Virginia, for
instance, has not yet opened its fairly lengthy home schedule. Here
at Pitt, the bats, uniforms, pads; '

  
  

etc. have been carefully packed
away for another year.

Our Panthers opened their 1947
campaign on April 18 expecting to
play a meagre total of ten con-
tests. Less than three weeks later,
the campaign was oﬁicially over

' ——eight games had beenknocked

off, two cancelled.

The pitchers and catchers, ﬁirst
called for practice drills, opened
up around the ﬁrst of March.

L Which all means that many of the
Pitt nine gave up around ten
iweeks of their time, from two to

A“ three hours per evening, for a

measly eight ball games.

What are the whys and where-
fores of this deplorable bit of
sports skulduggery upon the part
of our schedule makers? Well,
we know a little about it—very
little and those who do know,
keep it to themselves.

Originally eighteen contests
were on the diet for the Pitt nine.

Included among these were trips
to Annapolis and West Point to
meet the service teams—an annual
event on the local calendar and
a juicy morsel of competition. Be-
fore this was even published, it
was disclosed rather meekly that
Civic Light Opera stadium (Pitt
stadium to the benighted) would
not be available to the student
body after the ﬁrst of April. As
an immediate- consequence, al-
most half the’ number of games
were snipped from the card. The
reason given for this was, that
without a home diamond to prac-
tice on, it wasn’t worth trying to
ﬁeld a representative squad.

We keep telling ourselves that
we are coming up in the sports
world. Who are we kidding? Pitt
always had an all—around sports
program comparable to its grid-
iron powers. Remem-ber. we’ll
never get to heaven on eight base-
ball games. '

Spring Drills

What, you had trouble follow-
ing the ball at Pitt basketball
games last winter? Well then, you
probably won’t even see it next
year, for “Doc” Carlson has added
several new tricks to the reper-
toire of his famous “Figure Eight”
system. ’

Carlson has worked out plays
which embody ‘the pivot man in
his basketball formations. Of
course, “Doc,” citing this innova-
tion, is conﬁdent that the Panth-
ers of ’47-’48 will “Win ’em all.”
Working almost exclusively on
the plays centering on the pivot
man, Coach Carlson led the ﬂoor
candidates through three hard
weeks of the scheduled drill per-
iod.

Members back from last year’s
squad include:
Bill Cieply, Ed Latagliata,
Forquer, Steve Shuber,
George McCrossin. Dodo
terna was playing on the
ball team.

Two Panther ﬂoormen, Carl
Mehalic and Tom Ragen, have re-
turned for another season of bas-
ketball. They. played in 1945 and
1943, respectively.

Of the group of newcomers the
most promising are Al Rose and
Mort Lerner. Two Bill’s, Brehm
and Frederick, are another pair of
ball players from last winter’s
squad who are expected to stick
and prosper on the Pitt hardwood.
Even with the loss of sterling
performers, Nate Apple and Wally
Zernich, the Panthers of ’47-’48
look good, at least on paper.

oflfootball candidates wound up the pre—season activities last.

his staff have had a big job vi
during the training session converting the style of play from
T-formation to single—wing offense. Great progress has been

noted to date, and by the time’
Pitt meets Illinois next fall, the
Panthers are expected to roar
mighty loud.

Many problems remain unsolv-
ed for Coach Milligan. The single
wing requires a well-coordinated
backﬁeld pos-
sessed with
power and
stamina, Each
man in the
quartet ‘of
backs should be
capable of run-
ning, passing,
or blocking.

Carl DePas-
_, qua, backﬁeld
Milligan ace of last year
from Williamsport, looks extreme-
ly potent in his new role of half-
ba-ck. Carl weaves, bobs, and runs
well in his new loc-ation.

Only a few plays have been
given to the men, but the many
variations adopted from these give
the Panthers a deceptive, as well
as powerful line of attack, With
Paul Rickards in the passing
role, the Jungle Cats deﬁnitely
will be a passing aggregation.

The football players now have
till late August to mend their
bruises. Temporary plans call for

    

the squad to go to summer camp
at the end of summer prior to the
fall semester. ,
On the other hand, Coach Mike
Milligan and his brain trusters
will have many sleepless summer

      

 

 

nights, thinking of the fall cam- T

paign and new phases of attack.
“The men have shown a will-
ingness to work,” concluded Coach
Milligan in a summary statement
of the spring training session.
Milligan was silent about future
predictions, but
broad smile on his face.

WASCIEKO

By Myron Kopelman

_ Let’s imagine the Pitt baseball team is batting in the ninth
Inning of a tie game, and the bases are loaded with Panther
runners. Admittedly, that is stretching the imagination to the

extreme.

But let us further imagine that Coach Ralph Mitterling is
suddenly told that he may send any man on his team to bat.
The odds, are better than even that Johnny Wascieko gets

the call.

VVascieko was Mr. Consistenton the 1947 Pitt team. The

H stocky right ﬁelder compiledta .415 batting average and Wrest-

ed the team batting championship from Art Barnes.

 Johnny isn’t a distance hitter;
He bats after the fashionkof Paul

Singles .
and doubles are 2
his meat, and '
he sprays?
them into the
outﬁeld ‘v ery .

Has Nine

Battle Stars

Wascieko re- _
turned to Pitt
last year after ‘ _
three not alto- w35°‘°k°
gether uneventful years of ‘over-
seas duty in the ETC. Owner of
nine battle stars, the Carrick ath-
lete participated in‘ every Euro-
pean invasion except that of Nor-
mandy.

He admits that he had a _“little

  

the torpeoded troopship, Leed-

stowl.

The ill-fated ship went

down seven miles’off the African
coast. Approximately 70 men lost
their lives, but Lady Luck per-
mitted Wascieko to go unharmed
so that he might once again shoul-
der a bat for Mr. Mitterling.

Played With Local Club

Wascieko is a man of recog-
nized talents. In 1938, he had a
tryout with Minneapolis, and was
offered a contract with their class

D Butler team. "

But, “Times were tough, and I
ﬁgured I could make more money
working in Pittsburgh and playing
in the evening with Billy Fuchs’
Dormont club in the Greater
Pittsburgh league,” he explained.

He played with Dormont, and
Dormont won the Greater Pitts-
burgh league title.

Wascieko, is only’ a junior; so
Coach Mitterling will be pleased
to see him carrying a Pitt bat
again next year. ‘

A Linksmen Seek A

Revenge For

W. Va. Defeat

Things look dark for the Pitt
golfers this afternoon. The un-
defeated West Virginia linksmen
come to town for a return match
with the Panthers.

The Mountaineers boast a rec-
ord of six straight golf wins, one
of which was a 6-3 win over Pitt
at Morgantown two weeks ago.

The Panthers have yet to grab
a victory, suffering defeats at the
hands of Army, Penn State, West
Virginia, and Cornell.

Number one man on the West
Virginia squad is Mike Krak. He
has held that spot all season by
consistent wins. The Mountain-
eers’ lineup should be, following
Krak, Captain Don Hall, John
Crowe, Bert Davis, an-d Jack Feck.

Pitt, not without hope, will
throw Lou Ferraro, Bill Franke-
vich, John Kunkle, Harry Read,
Paul Davidson; and John Mohr
against the high-ﬂying Mounties.

Today’s contest was set back
from Wednesday. The two squads
will divot their way around Pitt’s
home course, Shannopin country
club.

The Panthers wind up their '47
season next Saturday when the
Penn State linksmen breeze into
Pittsburgh. ‘

Softball
George Weekes, director of In-
tramural athletics, announced

Wednesday, almost in desperation,
that softball games will be play-
ed no matter what condition the
ﬁeld was in.

The only way games will be
cancelled is if rain falls during
the time a game is scheduled.
The remaining games called for
must be played by the end of the
Week, so that the championship
playoff competition can be held.

Theonly action held this week
was in the National league where
the Bus Ad Sophs are leading the
ﬁeld of six teams with a 2-0 rec-

ord. One of the reasons for this,

lead is a good combination of pow-
er hitting and stellar mound work.

In their 17-2 victory over the
Med Sophs, the victors bunched
together 17 hits for the same num-
ber of runs, while their pitching
star, Meng, gave only four hits,
three‘6f them coming in the last
inning after he had a 17 run lead.

The Bus Ad centerﬁelder, Hicks,
hit for pay dirt during the game,
blasting out two homers and a
triple in four trips to the plate.

Only one game has been played
this week in fraternity competi-
tion, and the standings in the re-
spective divisions remain the
same.

At the end of next week, the
two top teams in each of the three
frat divisions will vie for top hon-
ors in a round-robin series.

.. . Intramural Roundup . . .

Golf

Applications are still being ac-
cepted for participation in the
University golf championships to
be played over the Schenley park
course next week.

Qualifying rounds will be car-
ried out in foursome groupings on
Tues-day, Wednesday, and Thurs-
day. When all scores have been
turned in, those with the lowest
qualifying cards will compete in
the ﬁnal 18 holes of the cham-
pionship round. » _

Participation cards will be giv-
en all applicants in the qualify-
ing 18 holes entitling them to the
round free of charge. These may
be obtained in the intramural of-
ﬁce at Trees gym.

Ping-Pong

Competition in the University
round-robin ping-pong tourna-
ment is being delayed by an in-
s-uﬂiciency of entries.

The various fraternities on cam-
pus are urged to submit their en-
tries as soon as possible. It is
likely that the table tennis match-
es will swing under way dur-
ing the week of May 26, at Trees
gym. Applications are now being
accepted from everyone interested.

Badminton

Doubles matches are being held
regularly on Tuesdays and Thurs-
days during the ﬁfth hour in the
Cathedral gym. Further applica-
tions will be accepted at the IM
oﬁilce.
