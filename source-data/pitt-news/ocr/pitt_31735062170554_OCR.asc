Tower Snack Bar,Campus Bus

by KAREN BURGIO '

The Tower B snack bar. alloca-

L tions, and the possibility of an-

other campus bus were discussed

at Thursday night's Student Gov-
ernment meeting.

Joseph Dutton, Vice-Chancellor
of Operations, is working on an in-
depth study of the problems with
Szabo Foods, using non-partisan
observers to. examine the .prob-
lem. Dutton feels that something
is wrong with Szabo and wants to
know what and why.

The Woman’s Housing Board
has expressed a strong desire to
"manage the Tower B snack bar.
There also has been some talk of
making the snack bar a “senior
bar”—sérving alcoholic bever-
ages to those 21 or over. .

» The Arnold Air Society, which
again had no representatives at

. the SG meeting has one more

week to state their case concern-
ing allocations. At present, no one
understands their budget and con-
sequently, it will not be funded.

Because of the overcrowding on
the campus bus, at second bus will
be in service as soon as possible.
The new bus will probably only
run during peak hours.

Because Greek Week and Engi-
neering Week fall closely to one
another and most students cannot
afford to attend two concerts,
there will be only one joint con-
cert this year. According to SG,
this will mean more money for en-
tertainment and less money to
cost. Again, there will be no-
vance sales and block seating
tickets will be available.

The reality of abortion was the
deliberated topic at the city-wide

Focus on Forgotten Vets

Men injured in the war in Viet-
nam and other conflicts. and then
forgotten about after being "put
away" in a Veterans Administra-

‘  tion hospital, are the concern of

 
 

"Project Oakland Vets." a new
opportunity for student volun-
teers recently announced by the
Pitt YMCA.

According to Rudy O‘Brochta,
project coordinator. the new pro-
.gram will focus on Sunday after-
noons, the “loneliest time of the
week" at any hospital.

Volunteers and patients at Oak-
land Vets Hospital will meet in a
“drop-in-center” in the hospital’s
recreation hall. Activities will be
unstructured, such as card
games, pool, and billiards, which
can provide a vehicle for people
becoming acquainted. Music ad
other entertainment can -also be
planned by volunteers and pa-
tients. '

O’Brochta explained that Sun-
day afternoon was selected for
the activity because the hospitals
staff is down to minimum
strength then and few people are
around with whom the men can
interact.

She explained, though. that the
project was not conceived in cri-
ticism of the hospital staff. which
shejudged to be quite competent;

in fact. the Pitt YMCA was invited ~

to develop the program by Mar-
shall Clark. the hospitals direc-
tor of volunteer programs.

Students who support the Viet-
nam war as well as those who op-
pose it ought to be concerned
about the men in veterans hospi-
tals, according to Tom Huff, di-
rector of the Pitt YMCA. He said
that people who expect men to go
to war and risk injury ought to
help those men cope with their
condition now, and that people
who think war is wrong ought to
be willing to help, men who may
have been wronged by being sent
,to war. He emphasized the im-
portance of men as well as wom-

en becoming involved with the pro-
a gram. ‘

.Committee.

O’Brochta described the Oak-
land Veterans Hospital as a med-
ical unit, with patients grouped
together according to medical di-
agnoses, rather than by war ex-
perience, as is, done’ at Leech
Farm Psychiatric Hospital, home

of another Pitt YMCA project.

She said that because the Oak-
land patients are grouped regard-
less of age it is esecially impor-
tant that Vietnamvets are able to
be in contact with people their

own age.

The project will begin on Sun-
day afternoon, Nov. 19, with an
orientation at the hospital and a
tour of the facilities. All students
interested are urged to contact
the Pitt YMCA, 3507 Student Un-
ion, phone ext. 281 or 687-5171.

If enough people volunteer the
project may expand to include vis-
iting men on the wards during the
week, and a telephone service to
out-patients who live alone.

Programming Committee

by LARRY PANSINO

The Programming Committee
of Student Government has slated
a re-definement of its duties and
authorities because confusion and
conflicts" have resulted from the
extention of smaller organiza-
tions into scheduling of campus-
wide events. '

Robert Emanuelle. chairman of
Programming. elaborated his con-

cerns and described the new fun- '

tions of his _committee. (‘We feel
there is too much uncontrolled
programming ‘and that we need to
concentrate the planning and de-
cision-making. We want to unify
all campus activities to avoid
conflicts. There are some things
that these smaller organizations
don’t know about in preparing for
these events. We feel its our re-
sponsibility to schedule campus
activities and that we can do a
better job of it.

“Before an organization plans
any activity we want them to get
approval from the Programming
This way we can
schedule one calendar of events
for the University and better in-
form the students about what’s

‘ going on,” he added.

In the future the Programming

Committee must okay an activity g

 

with theproblems involved.

of SG to be -Redefined

before allocations will be made
for it. This procedure will take the
burden off the Allocations Com-
mittee of deciding whether or not
an event will be held.

Emanuelle cited examples of
events he feels his committee
should have arranged: the Mort
Sahl engagement (sponsored joint-
ly by the Men’s Dorm Council
and the Public Affairs Committee
of the SU Board). a concert plan-
ned for Women's Cultural Week
by the AWS. and the Homecoming
concert.

Another concern of Program-
ming is intra-university compe-
tition among several organiza-
tions for the same speaker or.
-group. Such competition may
drive up the asking price of the
performer.

Emanuelle said that his com-

mittees restructuring proposals.

have the ‘support of Student Gov-
ernment and the Allocations C()ITlr
mi.ttee. and that they will be im-
plemented for the winter term.

Starting then, Programming
will hold meetings every Wednes-
day night at 8 p.m. to listen to the

proposed activities of organiza--

tions and students and to help

, ter birth is the death and dignity

Pro-Life Rally held at Synod Audi-
torium Thursday evening. The
four participating groups, the
Pennsylvanians for Human Life,
Women Concerned for the Un-
born Child, Birthright, and Stu-
dents for Human Life, concurred
that it is time to review the facts

of abortion.

"Life a continnuum from concep-
tion to death. No individual has

' the perogative to determine when

life begins. People must become
aware. They don‘t know what
they are destroying,” surmised
Mrs. Lippert. volunteer co-ordin-
ator f'or the Pennsylvanians for
Human Life in rebuking abortion.

The film Reality of Abortion,’

produced. by Agora Group and
written by William Hogan, an ob-
stetrician and gynecologist, was
shown to the small gathering in
the darkened auditorium.

The film, which shows a series
of fetus photographs, allegedly
proves that the fetus is not just a
cluster of cells with a potential.
but is a developing human. "At
conception, when the sperm and
egg meet a new individual is form-
ed. totally different from any
other on human. earth." stated
‘Dr. William Hogan.

Continuing he said. “No amount
of semantic gymnastics will
change the reality of abortion. The
fetus is a human. History has pro-
ven that no just society can exist_
when the strong decide the life
of the weak."

Agreeing with Dr. Hogan on the
principle that abortion is the in-
itial thrust of _a movement by the
hands of men to have power over
human life, Paul Frances, a
teacher in the Pittsburgh Public
schools, mentioned another so-
ciety in history which attempted
this dominance-—Nazi Germany.

In 1925, the Weimar Republic
passed an abortion law that paved
the way for legislation in Hitler‘s
reign calling for the sterilization
of any physical defected individ-
ual as well as mentally retarded
people. epileptics, and alcoholics.

Frances said, “Once we make
decisions for laws like abortion.
others may not follow. but it is
logical that they will. u

Frances bases his apprehen-
sions on several bill that have
been introducegin various state
legislatures. Among these bills
advocating abortions up until the
day of birth or. even three days af-

bill in Florida. This bill, if dis- 

patched, would allow two mem-
bers of the immediate family or

three physicians to end an inca- ; 1-if

pacitated persons life.

Bringing the discussion back to
abortion, Anne Frances
Woman Concerned for the Unborn

. Child, asserted, “We must put
emotion aside and dig into facts. .‘

We must persuade people we are-
not imposing morality but oppos-
ing murder. Alternatives to abor-

tion must be publicized and made, . 1

available.

Speaking for Birthright in Pitts-,,‘.,lVii.VA
burgh. Mary Kambice told the 
rally of young people some of the

services and alternatives offered

at their center at 4612 Bayard St. . g
A 24 hour Hot Line is available to T

Weaver said that she was ex-
tremely proud to receive the hon-
or and hoped that in-the future
the award would widen in scope,
increasing the number of award-
ees. “There are a lot of students
who deserve the award,” she com-
mented, “I hope that it will gain
more sponsorship.”

Sharing the honors with Weaver
is Tim Eberlein, a- senior in pre-
med. “I was happy when I was
accepted to medical school,” Tim
said, "it was a gratifying person-
al achievement, but receiving
university recognition is a great
honor. five never felt happier."

Many of Eberlein’s contribu-
tions to the university lie in the
medical area. He is presently the
president of Alpha Epsilon Delta,

(Pre-med honorary) and is the
past president of Beta Beta Beta,
(biology honorary). He has serv-
ed as orientation chairman of the
health professions and is the.edi-
tor of the annual “Hints to the
Pre-med.” This year he is also

The establishment of trade re-

and the“ Soviet Union’ and East-

 

ern Europe was the theme for a

-conference last Thursday sponsor-

ed by the Graduate School of
Business and the University Cen-
ter for International Studies.

Businessmen from corporations
across the country heard Roger
Severance of the Department of
Commerce explain the govern-
ment’s‘ role in helping businesses
make contacts in socialist states.

Leo G. B. Welt of Chicago,
whose company represents corpor-
ations trying to trade in Eastern
Europe and Russia, and Donald
J. Morfee, President of Swindell-
Dressler Company, gave their view
of the problems encountered in
trying to contact and negotiate
with the Soviets: problems dealing
with an unfamiliar economic sys-
tem in which government buying
agencies negotiate contracts for
a variety of ministries, as well as

Jackie Mullins, Homecoming
Advisor, said that there were only
19 applications for the award, de-
spite the publicity given to it,
but she expects many more appli-
cants next year, now that the stu-
dents have become familiar with
the award.

“The purpose of the award,”
Jackie emphasized, “is to recog-
nize those students who have
gone beyond their academic role
at the university and have dem-
onstrated contributional efforts.”

needing money. Once this is es-

_ tablished, the student must then

submit, in his own handwriting
on a lawyer's letterhead stationery,
an explanation of the reason. en-
dorsed by thelawyer.

“The emergency fund was not
meant for bail money and the way
it’s set up it’s impossible to use it
to get students out of jail. The
fund was designed for people who
are out of jail and in need of an
attorney for problems like pre-
liminary hearings or by students
filing legal action against stub-
born landlords in order to get
their security deposits back,” ex-
plained Nancy Brown, Financial
Director for the Legal Aware-
ness Committee.

She added, “If the student
shows valid written reasons, then
I will authorize ‘the emergency
loan once the proper forms are
completed and signed.”

Brown reported that money for
the fund was deposited last week
in Student Accounts, and that the
fund will go into effect as soon
as the proper forms.are avail-
able, probably sometime this
week.

All Business Transacted By Phone and Mail

by BARBARA GERAUD

Well, I never thought I’d live
to see this day, but I’m actually
starting to like Grand Funk Rail-
road.

Now, before all you Jethro Tull
freaks start screaming and de-
nouncing me from the rooftops
for liking GFR and not-“Thick as

4 a Brick,” let me hasten to add
‘ that I don’t think they’re all they’-

ve been cracked up to be, nor
is Mark Farner going to save
the world. Nor am I going to
race out immediately and buy
everything they’ve ever made and
sit in entranced vapidity before

’ my stereo.

What I am saying is -that their
new album, Phoenix (Capitol
SMAS 11099) shows a calibre
of musicianship and writing they
hadn’t shown before.

I went to their concert at the
Arena last November purely to
see what this “phenomena” was,
and not for any _real interest in
the group itself. I was impressed
with the act they put on—the “bro-
thers and sisters” bit, the sexual
overtones of Farner .and his gui-
tar—but saw the hand of Terry
Knight behind_the whole thing.

For the audience they appealed
to, it was a good show—nothing
fancy, but they trucked along and
kept everything moving. And the
only song worth too much was
“Gimme Shelter,” with all due
respect to Mr. Jagger & Co. Music-
ally and artistically, I wrote them
off.

' But this new album is some-
thing else. Nowhere is Terry
Knight mentioned; Mark Farner
wrote all the songs and produc-
tion is by Grand Funk. They’ve
learned some of Knight’s tricks,
but are also quite capable on

their own.

“Freedom is For Children" has '

to be one of the most beauti-
ful songs I’ve ever heard. Quot-
ing even a portion of the lyrics
wouldn’t do it justice; all six
minutes has to be heard.

“Flight of the Phoenix,’_’ the
opening track, features Doug Ker-
shaw on electric fiddle, and is a
good, hard-driving instrumental,
starting off with the death cry
of the bird, then the succeeding
rebirth of joy as it rises from its
ashes. (I’m quite sure we all see
the symbolism here.)

“Trying to Get Away” could
almost be a Beatles ballad—it has
that same 'indefinable something
that made so many of their songs
hits.

It’s all good stuff, even their

attempt at Jesus rock. “So You
Don’t Have To Die.” “Overpopu-

lation is the problem of today/ .

there’s too many children and
more on the way/if you don‘t
start some birth control you
won’t last much longer.” Some-
how, I can’t imagine Grand Funk
worrying about birth control.

But on the whole, it’s definitely‘

a good album, and one I’m glad I
bought. The only thing to
see now is if they can carry their
new-found musicianship (they
played all their own instruments
and have added a new member——
Craig Foster—on organ so Far-
ner can stick to guitar) on stage.

They’ve been feuding (a mild
word) with Terry Knight for
almost a year now, with suits
and counter-suits and counter-
counter suits, and nobody is sure
quite where anybody stands.
Barring any unforseen compli-
cations, they’ll be at the Arena

latest in Pat DiCesare’s attempts
to provide some sort of down-
town entertainment. I’m looking
forward to see what they do
this time around around.

New Grand Funk in“Phoenix" Delberl <3 Glen Pia)’  
Country Flavored Rod: 

by JULES M. SHEAR

Delbert & Glen is not the
folksie duo that the name im-
plies. This is a country flavor-
ed rock band that makes you feel
good. Delbert McClinton’ and
Glen Clark are the mainstays
of the band and they split the
writing and lead vocals up
evenly.

There’s no telling how many
are in the band since five are
pictured on the inside cover
and nine are listed in the cre-
dits. These guys sing-together
like they were born siamese,
and it is the vocals that make
this album so worthwhile.

Clark’s “Old Stand_by” starts
off the album withgood country
rock and sets the pace. The first
side builds to a high energy
Clark song titled “I Feel the
Burden” with its gospel feeling.. -':

The side ends with a lovely
version of the only non-original,
“Everyday Will Be Likeia Holi-
day,” written by William Bell
and Booker T. Jones. It gets you
ready.for the second side, which
is a little more funky.

  University Ignores
Student Problems

Many people on campus have found that the University dis-
plays a gross disregard for their problems and find themselves fac-
ed with a formidable bureacracy composed of individuals who seem
. to do nothing but make paper work for each other while attempting
" to get things accomplished? '

‘When one considers the problems faced by students in wheel
’-chairs’ and the lack of University concern for these problems, one can
5 only be appalled.

Students confined to wheelchairs often find that they cannot
I maneuver in many of the campus buildings.

. The Cathedral of Learning has only one entrance which does
2 not require climbing steps or passing through a revolving door. More
I -often than not, one student reports, this entranceis locked.

. Once inside the Cathedral, the problems have only begun. While
it.is possible to get an elevator to the upper floors, getting back
A down is something else again.‘ -
,  There are signs near the elevator on the third floor which give

,a phone extension so that persons in wheel chairs may summon an
»_‘elevator'. However, with that mystical sense of humor that is only
" "theirs, the University has failed to install a phone on the third floor.

_ One student reports that she must constantly interrupt an English
"Composition workshop to gain access to a phone. When the work-
' shop is closed, students must bang on the elevator door to‘ at-
 tract the attention of an operator.

., During" a fire, when the elevators are turned off, people in

‘wheelchairs would have no means of escape from most Univer-
sity buildings. P
I Access to the upper campus presents overwhelming problems, as
wheelchairs are designed for use on level surfaces. One student
reported having a near disaster when she lost control of her wheel
chair coming out of Scaife Hall. She has since been unable to use
 the Scaife Library.

Although students in wheelchairs may request a room change
if their scheduled room is inaccessable, rescheduling of labs is
impossilble, as the entire facility would be/[involved with such a

;.?move. A ,
s, P In addition to difficulties in negotiating cafeteria lines, students
. have found that it is impossible to gain access to the Hunt Room in
 a wheel chair, even for the unusually adventurous.

    
   
    
  
   
  
  
   
  
  
  
    
  
   
    
 
   
 
   
 
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
   
 
   
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
 
  
    
   
  

The only place where one can cross Forbes Avenue in a wheel
____chair "is at the Cathedral driveway, which opens in the middle of
..-_ a_ block. There are no traffic lights and the exits from Schenley
‘ ‘Plaza parking lot make the crossing especially hazardous.

Students find cars block the curb cuts on the Fifth Avenue side
, of.t_he Cathedral and in the winter, snow is plowed in front of them.

 * While many of these difficulties are beyond the control of the
' University, many have simple solutions.

' Proper utilization of the automatic elevators in the Cathedral
would eliminatetsome of the hassels. Modifications in the food ser-
vice lines would also eleviate some difficulties. Installation of a
traffic light, more curb cuts. clearly marked cross walks are not be-
yond the ability of a University which is about to undertake a mass-
ive expansion in facilities.

 in Defense Of,
Press Freedom

In the last week, the Pitt News _has received several letters. re-
 garding the front page of last Wednesday’s issue.

' The most distressing point expressed in these letters challenged
-‘the right of the Pitt News to present editorial opinions. A news-
’ paper not only has the right, but the duty, to present its own opinion,
’ as well as opposing opinions of its readers. A ‘

One letter suggested that newspapers must be “representative”
of its readership and only present those opinions with which the ma-
V jority of its readers subscribe.

, V If this were true it would beimpossible for the media to inform
the people of many social ills, such as racism or sexism. which are
“due to socialization of erroneous ways of dealing with certain prob-
lems. .
_ The letters also suggested that Wednesday's black page was an
immature, emotional response to the outcome .of the presidential
_, election. ‘

gjward such basic, constitutional rights as freedom of the press and
jfreedom of expression which Mr. Nixon expouses and which these
writers have stated. ‘

‘The Pitt News has, and will confinue. to express opinions
which we hold. We do not attempt to "shove (opinions) down the
students’ throats," but rather to provide a forum for student opinion..

We do not demand that everyone agree with these opinions, but
 we insist on our right and our duty to-express them. '

UAR Critics

by RUDY POTENZONE

Constructive criticism will always be invalu-
able to the Undergraduate Academic Review. Luck-
ily, most of the criticisms offered by Pat O’Brien
in last Monday’s Pitt News have been offered con-
structively by others. Many changes will be evi-
dent in the next issue, as a result of suggestions
from both faculty and students.

Mr. O’Brien questioned the relationship be-

— tween the U.A.R. and the Center for the Improve-

ment of Teaching. The two are entirely autono-
mous and are related only in that both have the
improvement of teaching as a goal. The Center
has the expertise to construct a reliable measure
ofteaching effectiveness. It should be realized

7 that the past questionnaire was part of a study

which led to a new, revised questionnaire which
is presently being used in this term’s evaluations.
It is shorter and some of the questions have been
reworded to alleviate ambiguity. In working with
the Center, the U.A.R. can comment on the sug-
gested questionnaire from-— the students’ point
of view, and can also add questions which are
interesting to the students. Through a coopera-
tive effort, the new course evaluation will be
improved.

There are two changes, beyond the new ques-
tionnaire, which are of primary interest. A new
presentation of the results for the U.A.R. is being
developed. The statistical section of the publica-
tion will remain the same. This gives, to those who
take the time to read the instructions, the distribu-
tion of responses and the decile rank. This decile
simply provides a means of comparing one teach-
er to another and to Pitt teachers in general. They
are designed so that the average teacher falls in
the 5th or 6th decile. Teachers in a higher or low-
er decile are respectively better orworse than aver-
age. Also, one is able to compare ‘one teacher to
another’ by looking at the decile. Following the
statistics is a brief paragraph for those who will
not use the numbers. The first sentence will state
the teacher's relative teaching effectiveness (bas-
ed on the decile). Next will be the number of
above average overall ratings (4’s and 5’s) and the

number of below average overall ratings (is and 2’s).

The remaining sentences present course difficulty,
grading, and contribution of lectures, readings,
etc., as seen by the students. The course require-
ments will also be presented. From the many sug-
gestions, this is hoped to be a most feasible, ac-
curate, and understandable presentation.

The second change in _the UAR is a policy

Shortsighted

change with regard to publishing the results of
the evaluations. The past editors of the UAR (my-
self and Ms. Kathy Stackhouse) agreed with Dr.
Grace Lazovik, the director of the Center for the
Improvement of Teaching, that teachers should
have the right to refuse publication of their re-
sults, after seeing them. Mr. O’Brien sees this
as simply an infringement on the rights of the
students. However, he seems to lose sight of the
second goal of the UAR, to help improve teach-
ing. We return, again, to-constructive criticism.
Student-Faculty communication is, unfortunately,
not well developed. By allowing the UAR to con-
duct an evaluation the teacher gets direct feed-
back on thegood and bad points of his teaching
and the course. It is his decision, however, if the
evaluation is conducted or not. In the absence of
a FAS or university wide action, or the absence
of departmental action as in Philosophy, evalua-
tions will only be conducted in class upon re-
quest. One must realize that in-class evaluations
in as large a university as. Pitt are the only ef-
fective means of course evaluation. The optimal
situation is to give both the instructor and the stu-
dents the. information. However, in formulating
this new policy, it was decided that getting the
teacher the feedback, at the expense of losing
some published evaluations, was more important
to improving teaching. This is especially true in
the case of a new or innovative teacher who fears
a bad published evaluation. He needs this feed-
back, and more than" likely desires it in order to
improve his teaching. But the threat of a traumat-
ic published evaluation will often be enough to
swing the teacher away from having the evalua-
tion conducted, if it must be published. Clearly,
in as much as the Center absorbs the cost of
-conducting unpublished evaluations, and not the
UAR, this policy‘can help improve teaching, and
not hurt the UAR. Realize too, Mr. O’Brien, that

evaluation, or critique in general, is not solely to .

point out bad points. Can a student actually
have an objection to a summary of good courses
to take as opposed to a small summary of those
to stay away from? Until the Philosophy De-
partment’s feeling of mandatory published evalu-

ation is accepted throughout Pitt. I shall firmly"

stand behind getting to the teachers the feelings

« of the students through voluntary published in-

class evaluations. There already are more courses
to be evaluated than ever before. (over 500 at
this early date as opposed to 360 last term). More

are being requested each day. What remains to be . i

seen is how many are published. I do believe most

R will be. We’ll see, Pat.

Election Turned Out For The Best  

by STEVE LUBETSKY ‘ .

Devoted McGovern supporters may brand me
a heretic, but the events of Election Day last
Tuesday may have turned out for the best after
all.
s On the one hand, I and many other finally got
the opportunity we had been waiting four years

for—to vote against Richard Nixon and to voice our .
dismay over his foreign and domenstic poli- _

cies.

Concurrently. Mr. Nixon. being the egomaniac
that he is. realized his lifelong abmition, that is, to
be elected as President by a substantial margin.

Although the differences between he and I are
virtually irreconciliable. reluctantly I confess that
I am nevertheless happy for him. Imagine what
might have happened if Mr. Nixon had lost. From
the day he was born, he no doubt counted so heav-
ily on reaching so high a plateau that a defeat
would have given him a serious setback. In fact,
it appearsthat his life depended on,winning.

Still, the question plaguing us now is the bal-
ance of Nixon’s administration. Now that the
President must no longer worry about reelection,
there hangs the immense possi_bility that he might
take his duties for granted and conditions through-
out the nation and abroad, as pathetic as they are
now, will deteriorate even further. '

On the other “hand. Nixon the egotist might
have the desire to go down in history as the
greatest Presidentever to serve this country. Fur-
thermore, his last year in office will be high-
lighted by the nation's 200th birthday. and a
constructive‘ record would leave a favorable image
of him in the eyes of future historians. Such a per-
spective of President Nixon suggests that he is not
a liberal nor a conservative, but rather an oppor-‘
tunist who will resort to whichever philosophy

‘best enables him to attain his objectives.

Interms of significance, the downfall of George
McGovern indeed is disheartening. The process
by which he was nominated combined with the
magnanimous victory of an Administration so cor-

rupt,as to partake in the bugging at Watergate ‘
_  raises ,seriou__s concerning the system of selecting,

lished. ,

a President.

-Yet the results are not disappointing, for the
disaster seemed imminent. Moreover, if McGov-
ern enthusiasts try hard enough, there is a rain-
bow to be found beyond the immediate cluster
of clouds.

For one thing, there is no doubt that despite

-McGovern’s walloping loss, his cause,never-the-

less made definite inroads in the minds of many
voters. This is reflected in the election of a sub-
stantial number of peace candidates to the House
and the Senate. It is also encouraging that the
Democrats gained two seats in the Senate
and are retaining control of the House. These two
sources of Nixon’s political opposition should be

effective in providing a check on potentially harm-

ful policies of his.

A final consideration which we must ponder
is the degree of competence that McGovern
as an Executive would have exhibited. As Sena-
tor, Mr. McGovern is a dynamic leader who has
courage enough to express a sincere convic-
tion, regardless of the extent of its popularity.
But as a potential Administrator, he seemed to
lack the effectiveness required for such a demand-
ing job. A

Those who fervently sacrificed their time and L

4

their strength for McGovern have every‘ reason to T3

feel relieved and even jovial. For the worst is
now over, the inevitable has already occurred.
Now we can channel our energies towards re-
building a fractured Democratic party and in
1976 produce not merely a winner. but‘a sensi-
tive leader who will abridge all credibility gaps
and steer this country in the correct direction.’ ’

'I‘o the Editors of the Pitt News:

As a‘ student here at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, I have sat
back for the last two'years and
looked forward to reading the Pitt
News. I have a sense of humor,
and even laughed at the various
jokes about Engineer’s and ROTC.

As I returned to Pitt this Sep-
tember of an election year, I
was truly interested in following
the campaign of both McGovern
and Nixon, although I had made
up my mind to vote for Nixon.

To say that you gave a fair amount ‘

of coverage and space to both
candidates would be a. lie. There
is no question who the staff of
the Pitt News voted for.

I feel it is the duty of a col-
lege newspaper staff to accur-
ately report the news as it is,
without interpreting the facts
and shoving it down the students
throats. Again, when I saw what
was happening with the cover-
age of the election, I just laugh-
ed it off as a childish act. I
really got a kick out of the stor-
ies and headlines about McGovern.
His picture was really quite popu-

,\_ lar to your front page.

But today I stopped laughing.

Your "four more year’s” front-

page truly stunk. It’s one thing to
support McGovern before the
election. but to lose.and take out
your personal feelings on the stu-

dents at Pitt, who didn‘t all vote‘
,. for McGovern, was uncalled‘ for.

The cartoon in the paper would
have been enough, but to waste
the whole front page on such a
childish stunt really makes me
stop and wonder. Next week we
vote in another election; an elec-
tion to continue funding worth-
while student activities here at
Pitt. I will most certainly vote
yes on the referendum, but I will
never again be able to regard the

“‘ Pitt News as being a truly rep-

resentative newspaper, let alone
worthwhile.

To the Editor:

We, the Italian majors and
minors, are deeply concerned about
the drastic cutback in the Italian
department. The problem is get-
ting out of hand. Very few Ital-
ian books are available, includ-
ing those published by our own
professors! Also, an equally limit-
ed amount of courses are offered
each semester. We can’t under-
stand the over-emphasis placed
upon other Romance languages,
when the italian culture has
contributed as much, or more, to

the various fields of cultural arts.
The necessary requirements for
studying a foreign language
should include a knowledge of
geographical and historical back-
ground of the specific country.
However, the university does not
afford an adequate study program
in this area of Italian. We sincere-
ly hope that both the students
and administration of this univer-
sity will be able to overcome their
apathetic feelings concerning this
issue.

Dear Staff,
After viewing the front page

‘of the Pitt News issued after

election day, one could only have
a feeling. of hopelessness for
anyone childish enough to con-
ceive of such an idea. It may have
seemed a “cute" idea at the
time, but as most enthusiastists
tend to discover, such an action
only hinders the cause which they
are trying to gain support for.

‘To me, it is very sad to re-
alize how _immature supposedly
educated persons can" be after

so many months of sincere and"

mature campaign journalism.

 Of. course. conventional ratings and polls must be dis-
S carded; the ingenious NUTS system must be employed._

.- The NUTS ratings were devised in the fall of 1967 by a
‘future famous journalist, Big Poison -Pattak, and myself. We
 were tired of hearing everyone downgrade the heartless Pitt
 team after their second consecutive-1-9 year. -

P  Big Poison coined NUTS from out “New Usage of the
.Transitive System”. Being astute mathematicians,‘ we both
knew that if-A were greater than B and B were greater than

?‘C, then by the age ‘old transitive property, A must be greater

than C.

 Q That fall, die hard Pitt fans will remember that the Pan-
_th_ers clawed their way to a 13-11 victory over the Wisconsin
g-,_f Badgers. By using our'NUTS system, we conclusively proved"
1.2-“Vthat Pitt tied for the National championship with the O. J.
jl . Simpson-led USC Trojans, who finished the year with a
 sparkling 9-0-1 mark. '

 ' Last Saturday’s loss to Navy makes the Panthers eligi-
,-gble for the NUTS scrutiny once again. Only teams with one
(“victory per season are allowed to be NUTS. -

Here we go—Pitt beat Boston College who whipped Tem-

ple who upset West ‘Virginia who beat Tulane who nipped

Baylor stunned Missouri who pulled‘ a stunning upset

 teams in the nation. ‘ ' 0

Therefore, by NUTS and only by NUTS, Pitt annihilat-

 ed Oklahoma, Greg Pruitt, Wishbone—T and all!_! !

The lines of attack are uncountable. By this method, Pitt

 as good as most every team in the country-other power-
7‘ house teams such as Ohio State, Texas and Notre Dame can

easily be shown to be no better than the ferocious Cats.
With two more weeks left of collegiate action, it is prob-

 (able that every top team in the country will have at least one

loss, thereby enabling Pitt ‘to viefor the coveted national

7 title.

Unfortunately, the various Bowl committees use a more

~-conventional rating system to determine who will fill the

screen on New‘ Year’s Day. That’s allright Pitt fans-we

A — know that. NUTS means we can play with the best of them.

I don’t want any skeptics arguing that NUTS‘ biggest

:_--fallacy is proved every week as Pitt loses to teams thatit is

better than. For you see, anyone believing in this system has

to be a little nuts himself.‘

But the most ludicrous thing about this whole system is

V6.9 that five years after it was conceived as a joke by two good
 friends, it is necessary to use it again this year when talking
 about Pitt football.

What’s that about Pitt’s return to prominence that I heard

averaging 15.8 yards a carry,
having accumulated a net» yard-

“age of 639 on 110 carries.

An example of Cooper’s abil-
ity to burn the Pitt defense was
hislongegain of 24 yards in the
third quarter. The Panthers had
pushed the Midshipmen into
a hole, they were 3-12 on their
own 14 yard line. ’

On the next play Cooper

A ran for 24 to give Navy more

than enough for the first down
and enabled them to forge their
way down the field to collect
their second touchdown and a
14-0 lead over the Panthers.

Right back Howard picked up
where Cooper left off and went
the last few yards in the Navy’s
drives to score three touchdowns. »

Although Howard only carried
the football 10 times for a total
of 37 yards, three of his car-
ries were good enough to score
Navy’s first three TD’s to lead
Pitt, 27-0.

Howard’s longest gain, a 10
yards rush was the start of the
Navy scoring. Howard copped
the next two on a one yard
rush each. The first of these

)version but Daniels’ pass to split

two was the culmination of a
drive that last 19 plays.

Glenny, the third outstanding
player for Navy, was the quar-
terback who piloted the Middies
to the victory over the Cats.

Playing the whole game,
Glenny hit his receivers 10 out
of 18 times for a total of 100
yards.

The Navy’s star quarterback
also scored the last touchdown
for his team. Glenny swept right
and rushed for 34 yards to claim
a TD.

The Panther offense, on the
other hand, was not quite as ef-
fective as Navy. Although Pitt
only fumbled once during the
contest (unlike many of the other
Cat performances when fumbles
greatly helped to defeat them)
and quarterback Bill Daniels only
threw one interception, the Pan-
thers found it almost impossible
to move the football.’

Both of the Panthers’ two touch-
downs occurred in the fourth
quarter under the piloting of
Daniels who had replaced start-
ing quarterback Bob Medwid.

With 8:26 left in the contest
Stan Ostrowski who had gained
62 yardson 15 carries forthe
game ran two yards to score for
Pitt. This was accomplished after
Pitt drove from their own 13
yard line in 12 plays.

HOWARD
Scores 3 TD’s

The second TD came minutes
later as Don Siegle rushed one 
yard into the end zone. The Pan- A
thers attempted a two point con-

end Lance Wall was incomplete.

Although Daniels only began
to play midway through the se-
cond half, he still managed to
gain 113 yards passing, complet-
ing six out of seven aerials.

P A With Blue-Gold Game

by RON SIEGEL -

With the football season’s end just one game
away, Pitt _fans can begin to look forward to the
basketball and Head Coach Buzz Ridl will unveil
his troops on Wednesday Night at the Pitt Field

House.

The team will be playing what is hoped to be
an annual affair, an Intra-Squad Game at 8.00.
. There will be no admission charge for Pitt stud-
ents, but all others will be charged one dollar.

There will be free shuttle busses leaving from
the student union at 6:30, and they will return

1/2 hour after the game. .

The “Blue-Gold” game, as it will be known,
will give Pitt fans the first chance to look at 6’l0”

Billy Knight, who had been forced to play the-
role of the big man in the past.

Knight, a junior, is mentioned as an All-Am-
‘erican candidate in all of the basketball maga-
zines.

Returning along with Ridl to coach the cagers
’ are Fran Webster and Tim Grgurich.

Grgurich coached Pitt’s freshman team last
year, but with the advent of the freshmen eligi-
bility rule, Grgurich’s talents will be shared by
the varsity as well, as the whole team has been
working out together.

The regular season gets under
way two weeks later against Mt. —
Union, a home game at the Field
House which gets under way at
8:00. That game will be preced-
ed by a junior varsity game, also
with Mt. Union, which gets un-
der way at6:00 P.M. '

The makeup of the jayvee team
has not been determined yet, al- .
though Ridl is not planning to ; - -
use freshmen in varsity competition. at least for
the early part of the season. 

- Another upcoming event of interest to Pitt
basketball is the Steel Bowl which will be played
on Friday And Saturday, December 8 and 9 -at
the Civic Arena. A limited number of tickets
have been put on sale for the charity contest at
the Pitt Student Union Box Office.

Pitt’s opening night oponent will be Cross-
town rival Duquesne, and the game will follow
the Jacksonville-Southern Illinois game. which
gets under way at 7:00 P.M.

The two winners will meet for the champion-
ship on Saturday night at 9:00 P.M.. with the
two losers meeting in a consolation match at 7:00
P.M. ‘

Expectations are high for this year's team.
which is hopeful of a post-season tournament. ‘

After shaking off some early first period jitters. the Pitt Hockey
Club made their season debut a success by trouncing St. Vincents
College. 4-1, Saturday at the Alpine Ice Chalet.

Kerry Browne collected two goals to lead the Pitt offense while
his brother Denny Browne and Frank Williams also scored. Pitt out-
shot St. Vincents by a 32-7 count.

At the start.of the initial period. however. the icers seemed to
have their troubles getting together. Pitt had trouble carrying the
puck out of their own end and both squads played sloppy hockey.

Dave Vache had a great opportunity for St. Vincents as he skat-
ed in on Pitt goaltender Mark Lieberman with a clear-cut break-
away early in the period. Lieberman came up with the save as
Vache shot the puck into his pads.

"The momentum then switched to Pitt's side and Denny Browne,
tallied the first goal of the season only 20 seconds after Vache‘s fu-
tile breakaway. Pitt poured on the pressure, keeping the play in the
St. Vincent end. Lieberman came up with another spectacular
save on another St. Vincent forward that managed to slip behind the
Pitt defense. ,

Kerry Browne tallied his first goal of the afternoon with Pitt
on the power play. Browne fired a waist high slapshot from the
point with only 23 seconds left in the period to put Pitt in the lead
to stay.

Denny Browne not only scored the first goal of the season for
Pitt, he also was the first skater to engage in the first round of fist-
icuffs this year. Browne literally pummeled Lon Hohenfield to the
ice with punches and had to be wrestled to the ice himself by the
referee in order to stop fight. -

.\ Pitt took four minor penalties in the second period. giving St.
’ ‘Vincents the power play. St. Vincents couldn’t capitalize on the ad-
vantage in manpower until the final minute of play as Pitt kept
control of the puck. Jeff Fondell fired a shot from the point that
glanced of a skate in front of the net and trickled under Liberman’s
leg for St. Vincents only goal. K
' Pitt came out for the third period skating hard and assumed,com-
plete control of the contest. Frank Williams scored with four and a
half minutes gone in the final frame to give the icers all the in-
surance they needed.

Kerry Browne lit the red lamp again with another booming shot
from the blue line for the final score of the game. The Pitt defense
held St. Vincents to a standstill as the latter did not put a single
shot on Lieberman in the third period; . ~

CATHEDRAL ‘OF LEARNING

By BART MACK

For the third year in a row.
the Pitt Soccer Team has clinch-
ed the West Penn Conference
championship. The booters suc-
cessfully defended their title by
downing Indiana. 3-0. Saturday
afternoon at Pitt Stadium.

Pitt posted a perfect 5-0 slate
in league play to claim the title
over second place Alliance Col-
lege. Alliance posted an impres-
sive 9-0-1 record. but a tie with
Edinboro late in the season spoil-
ed their then perfect winning
percentage.

Indiana came into the contest
looking to play the role of the
spoiler and for one half battled
Pitt on an even basis. The two
squads were knotted in a score-
less tie after the first 45 min-

a Monday, November 13, l972—TIIE PITT N131WS—Page ‘7

utes of play.

“We had some shots but
couldn’t put them in,” Pitt coach
Leo Bemis remarked. “They

defensed us really well.”

The Pitt offense came alive in
the second half with three goals.
Joe Luxbacher. Lenny Raffa and
Ray Rex found the range as Pitt
rose to the occasion to take com-
mand of the game. It was Lux-
bacher‘s 13th goal of the cam-
paign while Raffa scored his
second and Rex his fourth.

Pitt goalie Bill Haines turned
in his fourth shutout perform-
ance of the year. once again re-
ceiving excellent protection from
his fullbacks. Meanwhile. at the
other end of the field. the Pitt
offense not only tallied three
goals, but also kept the Indiana

defense in fits b_v hitting both"
goalposts and the crossbar 0
different occasions. 4

Bemis praised the play of the
Indiana booters when he said,
“Indiana probably played their
best game of the year. They made
it a tough game.”

Although the West Penn title
is not as impressive as a invita-
tion to the NCAA regional play-
offs. Pitt still came up with as
fine effort to keep their title.

"Everybody played a good
game." Bemis stated. "It was a
good team win and that's what
we like to see."

Pitt will face Penn State next
Saturday in the season finale at
Pitt Stadium. Penn State is ex-

pected to receive a invitation to I I

the NCAA playoffs today.
