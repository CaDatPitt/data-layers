Like all political science majors,‘

Jackson is required to take ﬁve “core
classes” ——‘ research methods, politi-
cal theory, world politics, American
political process and comparative
politics. And like many studentsin

her major,Jackson struggled to ﬁnd a a

seat in courses covering the required
material. - .

“It took me four semesters to get
into research methods,” she said. The
wait forced her to take upper-level
classes instead.

junior Chris Comer reported a
similar experience trying to ﬁilﬁll
his cpoliticalsscience requirements.

 ‘He too forced to take upper-

level classes in lieu of unavailable

core classes. ,
“Freshmen are forced to take

upper—level courses they’re not ready

S for,” Comer said.

Students said situations like
those faced byjackson and Comer
have been common since the political
science department redesigned its
major in 2009, creating a ﬁve-core-
class requirement and adding nine
credits to the rnajor. Now the major,
which yields a Bachelor of Arts, re-

quires 10 courses, and a Bachelor of

Science requires another two courses
and a related area. ‘

The department has also become
more crowded over the past six years.
Between 2005 and today, the num-
ber of students pursuing a political
science major has doubled from ap-
proximately 350 to about 700.

Universityofﬁcials pointed to the

’ increasing number of students and a

stagnant budget as signiﬁcant factors
in the registration diﬂiculties.

the major would grow so quickly,”

"Students, employees and residents

ﬁght the looming reduction of Port

Jim Ritchie, a spokesman for
the Port Authority, saidthe com-

stop the cuts. Still, Ritchie insisted
the protests are not being met with
deaf ears and that students and
community should continue to
voice their frustrations to both the
authority and state government.

“Itis very important for those
who feel strongly about this to
speak out. For those who are frus-

The 15 percent cuts will take ef-

the initial reductions suggested as
a solution to the $47 million bud-

ailing transit system. Further cuts
are scheduled for summer 2012,
when service could be reduced by

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a historic
shift on gay rights, President Barack
Obama’s administration announced
that it believes the Constitution for-
bids unequal treatment of gays and
lesbians in almost all cases, and
speciﬁcally when it comes to federal
beneﬁts for legally married same-sex
couples.

Attorney General Eric Holder said
in a letter to Congress on Wednesday
that the Justice Department would
no longer oppose legal challenges
to the Defense of Marriage Act. The
act, which was passed by Congress in
1996, bars the federal government
from recognizing same—sex marriages
or extending them the same beneﬁts
as heterosexual couples.

Holder said Obama had decided
that discrimination against gays can

no longer be accepted as reasonable.
Laws that allow such discrimination
“warrant heightenedscrutiny” by of-
ﬁcials and judges, he said, similar to
the scrutiny that courts give to laws
“targeting minority groups with a
history of discrimination.”

This new stance by the adminis-
tration was hailed as a “monumental
turning point in the quest for equal-
ity” byjon W. Davidson, legal director
for Lambda Legal, a gay-rights group
in Los Angeles. ' .

On Capitol Hill, Republicans were
sharply critical. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-
Utah, called the decision “deeply dis-
turbing. President Obama’s personal
policies are trumpinghis presidential
duty.” I

It comes just two months after
Congress and Obama agreed to re-
peal the military’s ban on openly gay
service members.»

The immediate practical effect of
the armouncement mightbe limited.

Experts from Stanford

Andrew Shull
For The Pitt News

A diverse crowd of about 100 peo-
ple ﬁlled Pitt’s Center on Race and
Social Problems conference room
at noon on Wednesday to hear two
Stanford professors give a lecture
on the ways society commonly‘
addressesprace.

“Race isn’t a thing,‘ it’s some-
thing we do,” professors Hazel
Markus and Paula Moya said
repeatedly during the lecture,
emphasizing the role that atti-
tude and education play in race
relations.

Markus and Moya, who col-
laborated to edit the book “Doing
Race: 21 Essays for the 21st Cen-
tury,” spoke about eight differ-
ent conversations about race they
identiﬁed as perpetuating racial
stereotypes in pop culture and

mass media. Their talk was part of
a larger lecture series sponsored
by the Center on Race and Social
Problems and was sponsored by
the law ﬁrm Reed Smith.

-“We have these lectures so we

can provide a forum to discuss’

race in a dispassionate way,”7said
Ralph Bangs, associate director

of the Center on Race and Social J

Problems. He said that Markus
and Moya were brought in be-
cause they are experts on the
topic of race relations, which is
oneof the areas of focus for the
Center on Race and Social Prob-
lems.

Markus’ and Moya said that
they strive to bring a more sci-
entiﬁc approach to discussing
race.

“We are talking about empiri- '

cal, observational phenomenon,”
Moya said.  _

Holder said the administration would
continue to enforce the law until a
ﬁnal ruling is made, most likely by
the Supreme Court. ' ‘ -

Longer term, even if the a_clmin-
istration’s View prevails it would
not force states across the nation to
grant equal marriage rights to gays
and lesbians. Currently,ﬁve states
grant marriage licenses to same—sex
couples. “

But Obama’s position, if accepted
by the courts, would prevent federal

agencies, including the Internal Rev- I

enue Service, from discriminating
against gays and lesbians who were le-

~ gally married. Its legal rationale could

also be used to challenge state bans on
gay marriage as an unconstitutional
violation of equal rights.

Gay rights advocates saw the deci-
sion as abreakthroughwhose impact
will be felt well beyond the dispute
over federal beneﬁts. It means “virtu-
ally allforms of discrimination” based

tion that we live in a post—racial
society.
“It isn’t an opinion that this is
not the case, it’s a fact,” Markus

_said.A“It’s OK to think of a post— ‘

racialsociety as an ideal, but it is
‘ important todistinguishan ideal

, we have about society from the
- reality.”

Markus is a social psychologist
and Moya is an English profes-
sor. Together, they used evidence
gathered from a variety of dis-

" ciplines to highlight how these
conversations were divorced from
fact and can often contribute to
strained race relations, despite
theirappearance. ’

They said that this multidis-
ciplinary approach comes from
a mutual respect the two profes-
sors had for each other, and it

Pitt named in top 50

Pitt was the only Pemisylvania school among
the top 50 “Best Value Public Colleges and Uni-
versities for 2011” inarankingpublished byThe
Princeton Review yesterday.

The Princeton Review teamed with USA
Today for its third armual listing of the top 50
private and top 50 public colleges, ranking the

schools based on academics, cost of attendance

and strength of ﬁnancial aid programs.
Princeton Review publisher, Robert Franck,
said the study is consistent with the Reviews
mission to provide information for students and
parents, and these days people are signiﬁcantly

“I could pay $46,000 ayear to go to Ithaca, or
I’m from Philadelphia, so at Pittl can pay in—state

In Pitt’s proﬁle on USA Today’s website, the
editors praise the University for its PittArts and
OCC program, as well as producing graduates
that have gone on to receive Rhodes, Marshall,
Truman, Udall, Gates, Churchill and Goldwater
Scholar awards.

The Princeton Review and USA Today contin-
ued to commend Pitt on its research programs for
biology students, its top—ranked medical center
and its high marks inthe Top American Research
Universities.

Franek said that 86 percent of respondents
in Princeton Review’s-2010 “College Hopes and
Worries” survey signaled that ﬁnancial aid would

be “extremely necessary” for them to pay for b

college.

The Review’s research showed that average
cost for a public university is $16,000 per year.
Pitt’s tuition is almost $14,000. Franek said the
average Pitt student receives $9,600 a year in
ﬁnancial aid. - so

“The total cost, withveryhighacademic rank-
ing; is only $4,500,” Franck said. “[Su1dents] still
get a stellar academic eiqaerience. Pitt is mak-
ing sure that students that need are receiving
ﬁnancial aid.” .

The College Board reports similarﬁgures for

the average amount of ﬁnancial aid received by

Pitt students.

and writing major, said that when he made the

“Ithas agood reputation for pre-med classes,”
she said.

First—year'medical student Enyinna Nwa—

for Pitt’s top—rated medical school because he
had “formed a community here.”

“Other schools need to give incentive to stu-

routes through Oakland will oper-
ate with reduced service, including
the 71A, 71C and 71D. .

This equates to 13,000 fewer
rides per day, or about 5 percent of
total riders. Port Authority board
members predicted that about half
of the regular riders will experi-
ence little or no change as a result
of the cuts, though 180 jobs will be
lost and the Harmar bus garage
will close. A

The slated loss of jobs and ser-
vices have brought strong protests
from some at Pitt, including senior
Kim Autore, who created the Face-
book event titled, “STOP the Port
Authority Service Cuts.” Though
Autore established the page only
Tuesday evening, the event already
had 318 attending guests as of
press time yesterday.

“When I ﬁrst heard of the cuts, I

like every other threat the Port Au-
thority has made in the past,” Au-
tore said. “But no money is turning
up this time. The students need
to be able to react before it’s too
late.”

The Facebook event is open for

students to leave comments per-
taining to how the cuts will affect
them. Autore called the petition
“a great way for Pitt students to
show they care, that they are not
unhappy with the large effectthe
cuts will have on their lives.”

The transit workers’ union ——

petition in hopes that signatures
would bring rider and worker frus-
trations to the Port Authority di-
rectors prior to March 27. A

for the department. “The goal with
the curriculum change was to, if not
shrink the major, at least stop the

1 growth.”

Goodhart said the change brought
about the opposite effect from what
was expected. Students continued to
enroll in the program at an acceler-
ated rate after the restructuring.

Arts and Sciences Dean N. John
Cooper addressed the budget trou-
bles and the state of the political sci-
ence department in an e-mail.

“Two years ago, Arts and Sciences
had a ﬁve percent reduction in its
base budget, which had an effect on
all Arts and Sciences departments,”
Cooper said. “That has ‘not impeded
the Department of Political Scienc-
es’ ability to continue its excellent
instruction nor to pursue excellent
research. - _

' “In fact, while these budget
changes were taking place, political
science strengthened its undergradu-
ate major. With regard to recruiting,
we are in the middle of a very exciting
recruiting season that I’m surewillbe
successful,” he said.

Junior Seth Kerr believes the only

answerto the political science depart-
ment’s woes is to hire new professors.
He emphasized that the new hires
should be professors willing to teach
lower-level classes.

_ Department chair Barry Ames
said the department is doing the
best it can under its current budget
to make classes of all kinds available
to students. 1

“We would certainly like to have
more professors,” Ames said. “I un-
derstand that the University has to
maintain a balance between what
comes in and what goes out.”

He said that ideally the University
would allot the political science de-
partment abudget for30 professors,
six more than are currently employed
by the department.

“We certainly could use a few
more people efficiently,” he said.

With the national recession be-
ginning to lull, the department has
put forth a solution to the core class
conundrum. This year it introduced
a proposal to the provost’s office that
would reformat core classes, increas-

' Shane said that the $45 million allocation.

provided at the end of former Gov. Ed Ren-
dell’s term in office — money that factors
into the Port Authority’s service reduction
plan — should be enough to stabilize the
budget deﬁcit until January 2012, making

_ the 15 percent cut unnecessary.

The union believes that it would be wiser
to use the Rendell allocation more quickly
to maintain current service levels through
January, avoiding the 15 percent cuts.

“By making cuts now, it reduces the
pressure on state legislation to ﬁnd a more
permanent solution to the budget problem,”
Shane said. .

The Port Authority disagrees with the
union’s stance. Ritchie said that Port Au-
thority does not disagree with the union
members in that the 15 percent cut is not
the best option, but in order to prevent a
larger cut in the near future, immediate ac-
tion must be taken.

“If you are upset about 15 percent, try
doubling that to 30 percent,” Ritchie said.

Though putting pressure on state leg-
islators is important for future solutions,
Ritchie said, the Port Authority cannot rely
on the current state level leadership.

“If we were to postpone the cuts, we
would be taking a large gamble that the

. problem would be ﬁxed [by legislators] in

the next couple months,” Ritchie said. “If
there had been any indication of a solu-
tion from legislatures in the near future,
then postponement would be more reason-
able.”

The petition will be presented to the Port
Authority at 8:30 a.m. on Friday, after a rally
and march from Mellon Square Park to the
Heinz building Downtown.

“Yeah this affects the jobs, the garage, but
more than anything it is going to affect the
ridership. Once you lose riders’ conﬁdence,
you never get it back,” Shane said. “We want
to provide a consistently good product to
our consumers.”

Back on campus, Dunkin Donuts employ-
ee Jeff Kulig described how the cuts would
interfere with his commute from the South
Side to Oakland each day.

“If the bus drives by too full, I’ll just have
to throw rocks, stand in the street, whatever,
and make them pick me up,” Kulig said.

Sophomore Brandon Nemeth, who lives
in North Oakland, also complained of the
possibility of increased difﬁculty getting
into Oakland from his apartment.

“They heard the buses down Centre Av-
enue were going to be cut. I guess we can
only hope the petitions make a difference,”
Nemeth said. I

The proposal would also make more pro-

Goodhart asked that students be patient
as the department Works to ﬁnd a solution to
these kinks. '

“We’re aware of the problem, and we’re
working hard to ﬁx it,” he said. “No solution
is perfect.” *

Racial conversations often
‘ﬂoat above the facts’

Race 4 2

presented more opportunities than chal-
lenges. »

Markus praised the way the humani-
ties looks at images and representation in
media and how these shape an individual’s
thought process. He said it is important
to ground these subjective phenomenon
in hard statistics.

“These conversations often ﬂoat above
facts,” Moya said.

Markus and Moya said that the most
compelling evidence they have seen that
society is not post—racial is the disparity
in graduation rates between whites and
minorities at schools with “high stakes”
testing. They said that about 50 percent
of black and Latino students graduate from

these high schools, which includes most I

public schools.

The Chronicle of Higher Education re-
ports similar statistics. A recent study,“
which analyzed graduation rates for 2007,
found that 53.7 percent of black students
graduate from high school in four years.
Hispanic students had a graduation rate
of 55.5 percent, while white students had
a graduation rate of 76.6 percent.

“High school graduation determines
who gets into college, and as we all know
that is an indicator of how much money you
will make,” Moya said. The other piece of
evidence they pointed to was the disparity
in incarceration rates between whites and
minorities.

“Whites and blacks use drugs at the
same rates,” Markus said. “But who is get-
ting arrested most for these crimes?”

 

CEIIEECIILIST

The spirit of the open forum was em-
bodied when Rosanna Weaver, a Pitt gradu-
ate student in the School of Social Work,
discussed persistent problems in race
relations before the lecture. Weaver was
speaking about the causes of segregation in
today’s society when a retired community
member, Roland Saunders, jumped in.

“Race has been part of the landscape
in this country since day one,” Saunders
said. He asserted that economic disparity
between races could be traced all the way
back to the Three—Fifths Compromise and
before. -

Weaver and Saunders both emphatically
agreed that economics and the long tradi-
tion of racial animosityvwere the driving
forces behind racism today.

Other topics discussed during the lec-
ture included the following: “Racial di-
versity is killing us,” “That’s just identity
politics,” “Race is in our DNA,” “Everybody
is a little bit racist,” “It’s a black thing, you
wouldn’t understand,” “Variety is the spice
of life” and “I’m blank and I’m proud.”

Markus and Moya said these conversa-
tions all contribute to racial proﬁling and
stereotyping.

Markus and Moya chose accept the in-
vitation to come to Pitt because they are
members of a multidisciplinary center at
Stanford, The Center for the Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity, which is
similar to the Center on Race and Social
Problems.

“Centers like this are the wave of the
future,” Markus said. I

Oral sex can

ral sex sure does have its
0 beneﬁts —— the best non-

pleasure-related beneﬁt
being that it never results in a
baby.

Unfortunately, many fail to
recognize that oral sex isn’t a
sure and safe thing in other are-
nas. . .

According to physorg.com, a
science news site, researchers
have found a 225 percent increase
in oral cancer because of human
papillomaviruses since 1974. Spe-
ciﬁcally, theresearchers found
that the risk for oral cancer in-
creases with additional oral sex
partners. 7

“You are what you eat” pre-
vails again.

We think the connection be—_

tween oral cancer and HPV is of
particular relevance to students
in college —- a time when too
many shots of tequila can loosen
people up enoughto get them on
their knees and into trouble.

A 2010 survey of 1,770 Yale
students found that 75.3 percent
of students had engaged in oral
sex with someone — more than
10 percent more than the num-
ber of students who had sexual
intercourse.

But the newfound potential
dangers of oral sex mean we stu-
dents need to consider our oral
sexual decisions as seriously as
we would our more “penetrat-
ing” decisions. Note: Oral does

lead to cancer

1'lOt mean safer when it COIIICS t0

sexually transmitted infections._
Contraceptives are still required «

to prevent STIs even if both geni-
tals aren’t invited to the party.
Protection might not taste good,
but what you were eating before
wasn’t exactly a cheesecake, and
it sure tastes better than HPV and
possibly cancer. -

After all, half of all sexually ac-
tive Americans will contract HPV
at some point in their lives, the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention have estimated.
And though two vaccines have
been approved by the FDA for
HPV, only 40 percent of females
in the United States have received
one dose, and only 17 percent
have received the required three
doses.

If you’re interested in the vac-
cine, Student Health Services at
Pitt offers the Gardasil HPV vac-
cine free to registered students

- younger than the age of 26. The
. vaccine is given in a three—dose

series spanning six months and

can prevent most cases of geni-

tal warts and cervical cancer, ac-
cording to Student Health. Call

412-383-1800 or check out the

Student Health website for more
information.

And since vaccination is al-
ways controversial, an even sim-
pler way to protect yourself is to
put yourself on a simple oral sex
diet and watch what you eat. I

I _ Wrong.
You probably think you

some UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM.

Transport your horizons

Relax, it’s OK totake the first bus that comes your way

 
 
  

Jacob Brown
Columnist

While  the Port Authority buses
regularly for the ﬁrst time in years, I
began getting the impression that I
couldn’t do itforlong. I
Perhaps spoiled from havingacar
with me for the last three years, I had
gotten used to driving everywhere -
including to my last three jobs where
I’ve gotten totake the scenic tours of
Wexford, Coraop0lis_and other sub-
urbs at my leisure. -
But after checking parking rates
and thinking of doing battle with the
chaos known as morning traffic, I de-
cided. to give up on that approach. I

. made a conscious effort to do what’s

environmentally hip these days and
take public transportation.

After deciding to go green, I
checked the bus schedule afew times,
forgetting each time thatl had printed
it out for the various buses that went
near my destination. I made four or
ﬁve copies of each schedule in all.

' Then, I had to pinpoint my bus
stop —— a half-mile from where I live.
I justfound out last week thatthe bus
also stops right across the Boulevard
of the Allies from my street.

It took a while, but after ﬁguring
out this whole bus thing, the actual

. ridership experience has become an

adventure itself.

During the second weekof com-
muting to my new internship Down-
town, I developed a cold that forced
-me to pick up my vitamin intake and
make room for What little more sleep
I could muster into my schedule. I
started wearing my winter gloves on

V the bus, refusing to take them off no
' matter how warm I became. And I

beganlwashing my hands twice as
soon as I’d arrive at work. A

Other aspects have been trouble-
some, too, like ﬁndingaseat attimes.
Perhaps this even led to my cold when
I’ve had to grip a rail or strap for dear
life, lestlfall on anunassuming senior
citizen.

Whenl have found a seat, though,
I’ve had the opportunity to sit down

quietly and listen to stories about
baby mamas, crack—cocaine dealers

and other topics you just don’t hear .

much about in Oakland. It felt like
National Geographic meets Gangland
at times, but the conversations were
thoroughly entertaining.

S It would be incorrect, though,
to assume that.I have nothing but
disdain for public transportation. In
actuality, I appreciate it immensely.

I The primary beneﬁt ithas provid-

ed, of course, is that it has gotten me
where I have needed to go, and I can-
not complain about that. Subsidized
through our tuition dollars, riding the
bus has saved me about $170 during
the course of a month, according to
the Port Authority’s Commuter Sav-
ings Calculator. '
Supposedly, even Ayn Rand took
social security money toward the end
of her life. To not recoup that which

~ you pay into would be a little foolish.

She said so herself. V

Pitt needn’t solar crutch to find happiness

Andrew Kaback

Iwas sittinginaplaza in Madrid, look-

are not going to Europe anytime soon
and that a lot of Spaniards are not all

anybody to jump to conclusions. The

in the world. And ladies, don’t forget
FemandoTorres. Spainisamust—seefor

Replaying that momentin myhead

likeamelodyfrom Iyaz, I realizedwhat
so manyof my Pittsburghfriends need
and deserve. It hit melike aChris Brown

roadtrip —— I felt like Iwas a little slow
for not realizing it before. What was I

missing in Pittsburgh for all of these

years? What is the difference between
Spanish smiles and Pittsburghfrowns‘?

It’s the sun! V

I’m spending the semester, is even less
sunny than Pittsburgh.

So apparently, we can’t control the
suntoo much. I meanthiswhole global

Are we really a home to happy

I’rn going to get the “Daayurmn, you
go there!?” that those Ivy kids seem to
get. When I tell people that I go to Pitt,
I usually get asked about Dejuan Blair
or ’I‘roy P_olamalu’s hair.

Come to think of it, I don’t really

, care how many Rhodesscholars Pitt

has. I don’t really care if our average
SAT score has gone up. I do care that
we are happy. I care that our students

don’t quite coddle the body, much
less make you feel in any way com-
fortable. '

But in an immersion sense, as
someone who had not really partaken
of the scene Downtown too much, it

has allowed me to gain a greater feel V‘

for the city. Since starting my forays,
I have seen what this city has to ‘offer
outside of its suburban boroughs.
From the architecture Downtown
to general people—watching, the bus
has given me exposure to more thanl
have seen in the previous four years of

living in this city. And it has provided
me with insight, too.

Just last Friday night as I rode
home from work, I had a conversation
with three people on the bus. Now,
with the wrong company, that could
sound like as much fun as listening
to- Barry Manilow while ﬁling your
taxes. But it wasn’t.

They talked about everything
from Penguins to college. They more
than held their own in a conversation
about sports medicine and cutting

something I was guiltylof doing in
high school.

Dare I say it, but the conversation
was more intellectually stimulating
than most I have taken part in dur-
ing college — and more educational,
too.

Last year about this time, I re-
ceived correspondence fromapromi-
nentblogfounder after meetingwith
him in New York. After discovering
that I had failed to secure an intern-
ship with a magazine, I asked him

gave me a detailed, philosophical
response that said I needed to open
my horizons.

As I was a native Midwestemer
interviewing for a position in New
York City, he had a point. But one
thing he said that stood out to me
was this: “Get on the ﬁrst bus you see,
no matter where it’s going.” ’

As nice of a place as it is to live,
Pittsburgh is a dearth of originality
from one day to the next, mostly be-
cause we all encapsulate ourselves

Taking rnore buses has broadened perspective

same routines over and over again
while expecting progress. That’s also
called 

But as impractical as it may be,
perhaps the blogfounder’s logic holds
the greatest truth of all: Go out of
your comfort zone, ride a bus, see
the sights and hear the sounds. You
might just learn something or ﬁnd
something you like.

undergraduate students who to
publish pieces by the Pitt com-

A Night Full of Stars

Saturday, 6:30 p.m,
Kelly-Strayhorn Theater
Sponsored by the South-
western PA AIDS Coalition
$10 at the door or free if a per-
son gets tested at one of the
participating free sites before
the event.

This Saturday, local entertainers
will use their talents to raise AIDS
awareness.

The Southwestern PA AIDS
Coalition will present a talent
show—— including hip—hop artists
Miss Money and Jacquay Hosey
and female impersonator, singer
and dancer Akasha Lestat.

More than 3,000 people in
Southwestern Pennsylvania have
HIV or AIDS, according to the
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force. Two-
thirds of these cases are in Allegh-
eny County, and as recently as

2008, blacks accounted for nearly
50 percent of new infections.

“A Night Full of Stars” is de-
signed to speciﬁcally reach out to
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender

and queer members of Pittsburgh’s '

black community.

“In [the LGBTQ] community,
the statistics are really bad and
the infection rates are really hig ,”
said Amir Clemons, a minority dis-
ease specialist at the Allegheny
County Health Department.

Clemons — who is also one ‘of
three hosts for the event — thinks
using a talent show will speak to
this target audience in a different
tone. He said it is important to do
outreach to this group because it
is the fastest-growing population
with AIDS in the United States.

Terry Fluker, chairman of
a prevention committee at the
Southwestern Pennsylvania AIDS
Planning Coalition, said that each
artist participating in the show is
expected to incorporate informa-
tion about HIV/AIDS into his or

her act.

“The venue is open to the pub-
lic but the target is GLBTQ — so,
most of the artists are from that
community or those that embrace
it or aregay-friendly,” he said.

Chris Greer, a spoken word
artists and poet, will be using his
poem “Wake Up Call” to discuss
different aspects of HIV/AIDS and
share statistics.. Greer said that

if the day he found out he’d have to

include HIV/AIDS in his perfor-
mance, he’d already been working
on the poem. I

“Basically, we’re putting it out
there that a lot of people don’t

want to talk about it a lot of people ‘

haven’t had a chance to hear their
voices heard  You don’t have to
wait for someone big to say it,”
he said, explaining that locals ce-
lebrities have the power to raise
awareness about the issue.
Another way that Fluker and
several others are trying to raise
awareness is with the church.
Fluker is also a minister in

Dymin will be perfoing at “A Night 

Hip-hop artist Raqel A

Since reading about W1seau’s mag-

spread the word of its existence to
several of my hometown friends, who

have quickly joined me in proclaiming
it a work of obtuse genius. They have
labeled Wiseau — the Frankenstein-

who credits himselfas the director,
actor and writer -— as an oblivious
sort of auteur.

my bemusement — when I read that
someone else nowwants to usurp Wi-
seau’s spotlight.

In a recent Entertainment Weekly
article, a man named Sandy Schklair
— whose International Movie Data-
base page lists a respectable string
of script-supervising stints — is de-

manding that he be credited as the
director of ‘The Room.” Accordingto
him, Wiseau became too enveloped in
his acting role to handle the director’s
chair, and Schklair — initially hired
as, of course, a script supervisor —
said he was asked to “tell the actors
what to do, and yell Action!’ and ‘Cut!’

ALBUM REVIEW  

Band’salbum blooms

Patrick Wagner
Staﬁ Writer

Expatriate

"In The Midst ofThis

Rocks Like: Franz Ferdinand, Arcade Fire,
MGMT
Grade: B

By some histories, indie rock started with an
Australian group called The Go—Betweens in
the late 1970s.

Today, the members of Expatriate — a
Sydney—based group centered around singer-
guitarist Ben King —— continue that Australian
indie—rock tradition. After two_EPs and an Aus-
tralian release in 2007, they’ve brought In The
Midst of This to North America.

0 The sound is familiar with clever guitar lines, .

pounding drums and introspective lyrics. The
leading track, “Get Out, Give In,” escalates like

the best of the Canadian band Arcade Fire as .
King delivers the_line “intro-to life / exit to dea ”

with an understated warble.

Damian Press’ keyboard is one of the most
distinctive features on the album, with tracks
like “Play A Part” built upon the keyboard’s
charismatically synthesized ﬂute.

Later in the album the group seems to play

more with its dynamics and tracks like “Dead—
man” use these changes to great effect. Chan-
neling the psychadelia of the American group
MGMT, it breaks from the established “sound”
it has on most of the album and — to put it
frankly — plays differently. “Blackbird” experi—‘
ments with drones and the ﬁnal track “Are You
Awake” could be an outtake from the British
band New Order.

Although there are some rough patches early
on — where the band doesn’t seem to ﬁnd a .
strong individual voice — the later tracks ﬂower
into a pretty darn good album by Australia, and
anyone else’s, indie—rock standards. “ 7

ALBUM REVIEW

Celtic singer wistful and sweet

Liz Keeney

Staﬁ Wri ter
Sara Banleigh
The Folk
B-

Rocks Like: The Pogues, Sinead O’Connor

With March and St. Patrick’s Day not too far in
the future, it’s time to start thinking music —
traditional Celtic music. I

The debut EP from piano—based folk singer 0
L Sara Banleigh, aptly named The Folk, is a good

addition to any collection of world—folk music.
Her music features 1oo—year—old songs from
Ireland and the British Isles. A

The Folk follows the tradition of Irish and
British music with its narrative lyrics; each of
the ﬁve songs tells a different story. Many have
darkthemes aboutunrequited love, betrayal and
murder. Known as Caoineadh songs — essen-
tially the traditional Irish version of the blues
— most of the tracks on the album run a bit on
the depressing side, which is abit overwhelming
by the third song. ,

“Mary Hamilton” and “Geordie,” Scottish
and British songs respectively, are melancholy,

' given the subject. Both are semihistorical stories

of public hangings but at the same time, both
haveasad sweetness thatkeeps themfrom being

   
   

overly ‘gloomy. .

Overall Banleigh makes good use of her two
best assets, her unusual voice and her skill with
the piano, by arranging songs to complement
both.

Not typically acceptedby Irish—music purists
who stick to traditional instruments like ﬁddles,
ﬂutes, guitars and the bodhran, Banleigh’s piano
adds alevel of interest to agenre ofmusic that can
otherwise be slightly homogenous.

“Railroad Boy,” the openingtrack and one of
the best songs on the EP, showcases Banleigh’s
haunting voice with an a cappella introduction,
followed by a simple accompaniment of piano
and violin. ﬂ

Three Rivers Review

Formerly known as Thirst, Three Rivers
Review is the project of undergraduates
who wanted to publish literature soley
from the Pitt community. As the years
passed, the magazine grew into a larger,
award-winning publication.

The magazine’s website describes its
goal as accepting “the best” student litera-
ture. Last year, the magazine won the na-
tional Associated Writing Program\Award
for best content. The ﬁrst issue under the
tenure of former editor Joel Coggins re-
ceived the 2010 National Program Direc-
tors’ Prize. ~

I “I looked at some of the magazines that

had won’ the" award and I knew we were, 1

at the very least, on that level,” Coggins
said. V I

Coggins, who now works for University
of Pittsburgh Press, called his time working
at Three Rivers Review the best part of his
Pitt experience. He said having an abun-
dance of literary magazines on a college
campus is important, especially for writing
majors who’d like to gain exposure.

Jeff Oaks, the faculty adviser to the
magazine, said that many of the students
he’s worked with move on to careers in
publishing and writing.’ ~

The magazine also publishes interviews
with established authors. Coggins attri-
butes this mostly to luck and said the Three
Rivers Review’s age and awards might also
play a role. ‘

All three magazines are, available
through the Honors College and accept
submissions through their respective web-
sites.

Pittsburgh and founder of Love Ministry
Outreach Victors, a religious program that
promotes AIDS awareness. He hopes that
bringing AIDS education and awareness to
the church will help break down the stigma
surrounding the disease as he feels the black
community is a very faith-based one.

tion. If you are missing them, then you are
losing the battle,” he said.

While Anderson and Fluker both look to
the church as a vital center and the poten-
tial future for AIDS awareness in the black
community, Pitt senior and Rainbow Alli-
ance member Greerlin Thomas has other
feelings. I , '

munities. Last October, the Pittsburgh AIDS
Task Force launched the “Fighting AIDS

Inspires the Heart,” Initiative — or,‘ more

simply, the “F.A.I.T.H.” Initiative.

Tony Anderson, the coordinator of this
project, explained that it will work with the
Pittsburgh’s religious community by creat-
ing programs tailored for various groups
and raising awareness through special
events. P ‘

F.A.I.T.H. will host a conference at the
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary in May
that will bring together leaders from the
religious community, health professionals
and social workers.

.“We’re coming from both an outreach
perspective and a science perspective,”. An-
derson said.

“The information out there really is not
accurate — people don’t understand trans-
mission,” he added. “Stigma still trumps

Anderson stressed the importance of

remembering a time he was at church with
his mother during his childhood. The pastor

was talking about the movie “The Birdcage,”

in which the two main characters are a gay
couple.

“I remember distinctly him saying it can’t
possiblybe. a family-friendly ﬁlm because
they are gay,” he said. ‘ _

Thomas thinks this particular type of
homophobia is rooted in fear or racism and
the sense that members of the black com-
munity need to be strong.

“To be gay was a white-person thing.
If you are a’ person of ‘color and LGBTQ,
there, is no place for you [in the black com-
munity],” he said. ’

Thomas estimates that of the 40 to 50
active members of Rainbow Alliance, about
ﬁve are black. ‘

Although Rainbow Alliance has not re-
cently sponsored events speciﬁcally target-
ed at the black LGBTQ community, Thomas
said the oﬂice has educational literature and
books available on the subject as well as free
condoms. Each semester Rainbow Alliance
also hosts a safe sex workshop. I

my opinion, is whether this would deflate the

After all, let’s face it -— lampooning the idi-

Accordingly, when someone like Schklair

undermines its central appeal. After all, if “The

’<*MEN”S BASKETBALL

Panthers set for Backyard Brawl

Luc Felak I Senior Staff Photographer
Gil Brown dunks in Pitt’s triple-overtime win over West Virginia at the Petersen Events Center last season.
This will be Brown’s last regular season matchup against the rival Mountaineers.

Roger Sepich
Staﬁ” Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team has
been in a relatively unfamiliar posi-
tion this past week.

Coming off a 60-59 loss at St.
John’s on Saturday, the past few
days marked only the third time
this season that the Panthers have
had to prepare for a game while
recovering from a loss.

“You learn from wins and you
learn from losses,” Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon said in a news confer-
ence this week. “We’re still in a
pretty good position.”

Despite falling one point short
at Madison Square Garden against
St.]ohn’s, Pitt (24—3, 12-2 Big East)

enters tonight’s much-anticipated ’

Backyard Brawl against West Vir-
ginia at the PetersenEvents Center
with a two-game lead in the Big East
standings.

“We know what’s at stake
[against West Virginia]. We want to
come out and win this Big East sea-
son championship and we know we

can do that these. last four games,”
Pitt senior forward Gilbert Brown
said. “So we have to come out and
make a statement and play really
aggressive, and play together on
Thursday.”

The Panthers can also take sol-
ace in the fact that junior guard and
leading scorer Ashton Gibbs, who
played at St. John’s and scored a
career-high 26 points after miss-

ing the previous three games with

an MCL injury, will play in his ﬁrst
home game since Pitt defeated Cin-
cinnati at the Pete on Feb. 5.

Pitt has also already defeated
the rival Mountaineers once this
season. H

On Feb. 7, in their ﬁrst game
without Gibbs, the Panthers trav-
eled to a tough environment in Mor-
gantown,‘W.Va., and emerged with
a gutsy 71-66 win, with four Pitt
players scoring in double ﬁgures.

West Virginia (17-9, 8-6 Big East)
comes into the second Backyard
Brawl of the season having recorded
one of its biggest wins of the year
in its last game.

Panthers falter in second half against

 

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
team traveled to Georgetown
with an even 13-13 record, look-
ing to earn a victory and an
advantage in the win column.

And with Pitt having won ﬁve
of the last six contests against

"3 the Hoyas, history seemed to be

in the Panthers’ favor.

All seemed to be going accord-
ing to plan, but then the second
half rolled around.

The No. 18 Hoyas diverted

:1-:~the Panthers’ plan and came

away with a 67-57 Big East Con-
ference win, thanks in large

part to a second-half resur-
gence. The Panthers lost the
game and their even .500 mark.

The ﬁrst h_alf belonged to the
Panthers, who went into the
locker room witha 29-25 lead
after shooting an outstanding 60
percent from the field whereas
the Hoyas managed just less than
30 percent.

Throughout the entire open-
ing half, the Panthers (13-14, 5-9
Big East) never trailed and even
jumped out to a nine-point lead
with 30 seconds left to play.

In addition to ﬁeld goal per-
centage, the Panthers held the
advantage in most other cate-
gories in the ﬁrst 20 minutes of
play, including rebounds, assists,

blocked shots and free throws.

What Georgetown (21-7, 9-5
Big East) lacked early on in the
game, it made up for in the sec-
ond half, taking the statistical
leads and eventually the ﬁnal
lead in the contest.

The Hoyas’ Ta’Shauna “Sugar”
Rodgers led her team with 16
points, 14 of which came in the
second half.

Georgetown was also paced
offensively by Alexa Roche and
Tommacina McBride with 13 and

_ 12 points, respectively.

Pitt’s senior guard Jania Sims
led all scorers with 17 points, and
fellow classmate Taneisha Har-

rison contributed 16 points to»

the offensive efforts.

Sims, one of the best free-
throw shooters in the Big East,

earned 11 points from 13 attempts.

from behind the foul line.
Harrison was recently named
to the Big East Honor Roll for
the second time this season for
her exceptional offensive perfor-
mance in the Panthers’ last two

’ games, where she averaged 24

points and 6.5 rebounds.
Chelsea Cole, the Panthers’
starting senior center, earned
her Big East-leading 15th dou-
ble-double of the season with
10 points and a game—high 14
rebounds. As a team, the Pan-

thers out—rebounded the ‘Hoyas’

36 to 33.
The 2011 Pitt team is com-

Hoyas

posed of only senior and fresh-
man players, and in this game,
the freshman. class was not well
represented.
I Freshman Ashlee Andersen
‘ has seen her playing time in-
crease for the Panthers in recent
gamesand had recorded double-
digit scoring ﬁgures in two of her
last three games before playing
the Hoyas. But Andersen was
held to just three points in her
29 minutes.

Andersen’s three points,
along with just two from fresh-

Ryan Brode and the Panthers will welcome in ﬁve new players next season in their
inaugural campaign in the Petersen Sports Complex.

Roger Sepich

Pitt men’s soccer head coachjoe Luxbacher
announced the addition of some new talent
for the program Wednesday as he officially
released the names of the 2011 recruiting
class. ‘

The class is comprised of ﬁve new ‘stu-
dent—athletes who signed National Letters
of Intent and will be the ﬁrst group of play-

— ers to compete at the new Petersen Sports

Complex for theirentire Pitt careers. V .

competitiveness and leadership skills.”
Dickenson, Lowman and Onyeukwu were
all teammates on Cobb FC, based out of At-

lanta. The trio led the team totwo Atlanta’ ‘
Cup Championships while also helping the A 
Chiefs win the prestigious Disney Soccer" ‘

Showcase in December.

Johnston served as the goalkeeper of the
Leg—A-Z elite club team that held the No. 1
ranking in Florida club soccer last year.

Myers, out of Strath Haven High School,
collected 23 goals and 15 assists during his
three—year career on the Panthers’ varsity
team and helped them advance to the district
quarterﬁnals each year.

This is a very versatile and
accomplished class.

gusta, Ga.), midﬁelder Alexander Lowman
(Douglasville,- Ga.) and forward Chukwudi
Onyeukwu (Austell, Ga.) will all come to
Pittsburgh next year from the Peach State.

Meanwhile, goalkeeper Leejohnston III
(Newberry, Fla.) and midﬁelder/forward
Ryan Myers (Wallingford, Pa.) round out
the Panthers recruiting class.

“This is a very versatile and accomplished
class,” Luxbacher said in a statement. “The
ﬁve young men possess the qualities my staff
and I look for when recruiting: commitment,

He was also a key member of the Bran-
dywine United Galaxy club team that won
the Pennsylvania State Championship in
2008.

“I believe this group will set an estab-
lished foundation for the future of the Pan-
thers program,” Luxbacher said.

The new recruits will look to help the
team improve on last year’s performance.
Last season the Panthers ﬁnished with a
6-9-2 record, narrowly missing qualifying
for the Big ‘East Tournament. I

AN OLTMANNS OPINION

«NFL combine overrated way to assess players

Individual workouts lead some players‘ to be vastly overvalued when it comes time for April’s NFL Draft

Alex Oltmanns

 

It’s that time of the year again — the time
to get your stopwatches and tape measur-
ers out.

It’s time for the NFL combine.

Beginning with the weeklong event
that started yesterday in Indianapolis,
hundreds of prospective NFL players will
have their physical skills and attributes
broken down and overanalyzed from now

until the draft in April. .

,,_._ NFL team representatives drool over
players who perform well in the combine
events like the 40-yard dash, bench press,
shuttle runs and long jump.

B_ut maybe it’s time we stop putting so
much stock in these events and simply
evaluate a player by their body of work
on the college football ﬁeld and not just
on how many times he can rep 225 pounds
on the bench press. .

Too many times have average col-

Sports Editor V

lege players emerged from the combine
as stars, with their impressive 40-yard
dash time interpreted to equate to NFL
stardom. ‘

Take Oakland Raiders receiver Darrius
Heyward-Bey, for example. .

Heyward-Bey was a decent player in
college at Maryland, being named as an
All-ACC honorable mention selection his
senior year.

' But his blazing fast time of 4.32 seconds
in the combine’s 40~yard dash led him to
become the first receiver taken in the 2009
draft at ‘N o. 7 overall, ahead of proven col-
lege receivers like Michael Crabtree and
Jeremy Maclin. .

Not surprisingly, ‘Heyward-Bey has
been a bust in the NFL so far, totaling just
35 catches in his first two seasons. ‘

Comparatively, Maclin had twice as
many grabs with 70 in just last season
alone. '

Then there are guys like Tim Tebow,
widely considered one of the best college
football players ever, who fall to N 0. 25 in
the draft because they can’t run two—tenths

ous four games, the Mountaineers responded A

and comfortably beat then—No. 7 Notre Dame
72-58 Saturday in Morgantown, W.Va.

“I thought we played with a lot of enthu—
siasm throughout the whole game,” West
Virginia head coach Bob Huggins said after
the Notre Dame victory. “This is probably
as hard as we have played since the Purdue
game for 40 minutes. I think everyone we put
in played hard.”

The Mountaineers, like Pitt, have spent
signiﬁcant time in recent games without their
leading scorer. ‘

West Virginia senior guard Casey Mitchell,
who is averaging 14.8 points per game, was
suspended for three games by‘Huggins in
January for violating team rules and has seen
fewer minutes since his return.

But Mitchell’s absence has proved the
Mountaineers are‘ far from a one-man
‘team. ' A

Junior forward Kevin Jones and junior
guard Darryl Bryant both average in double
ﬁgures for West Virginia, with 12.7 and 11.0
points per game, respectively. Senior Joe
Mazzulla also helps the Mountaineers in all
facets of the game. The defensive—minded
guard averages 6.7 points, 3.9 assists and 3.8
rebounds per game. '

“It is kind of tough playing against two

point guards,” Pitt sophomore guard Tra~
von Woodall said of Bryant and Mazzulla.

- “They’re both able to create for each other

or for themselves, but we’ve just got to try
to guard everybody the same with the same

intensity.” ‘ 

Thursday’s game also marks the ﬁrst
time the two teams have met at the Petersen
Events Center since the unforgettable triple-
overtime 98-95 Pitt victory over then No.4
West Virginia last February.

But this year, the tables have turned on
the two programs.

Like last season’s West Virginia team that
would eventually make the Final Four, the
Panthers have spent most of this year ranked
in the top ﬁve nationally and enter Thursday’s
game No. 4 in the AP Poll and No. 6 in the

ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll. The Moun-1*

taineers come into the showdown unranked,
although they received votes in both polls.

Pitt has won nine of the last 10 at home
against West Virginia, but last year’s classic
proves that in the Backyard Brawl, rankings
and records are meaningless.

“We know they’re hungry, especially com-
ing off of a win. They want to prove that they
can beat us,” Brown said. “We have to stay
focused, stay on our heels and deﬁnitely not
take them lightly”. .

tion from the bench.

, Despite the impressive individual per-
formances by Sims, Harrison and Cole, the
Panthersywere unable to maintain their

dominant style of play late in the second i

half.

The Hoyas took their first lead of the
game at 10:24 in the second half after -a
3-point basket by Rodgers. Rodgers was
4-12 from behind the arc, and her team
was 10-for—29.

In contrast, the Panthers were 4-for-1?
from long range, with Harrison accounting

for three of the four successful shots.

After gaining the 43-43 edge, the Hoyas
went on a 15-6 run and extended their lead
to 11, securing the Georgetown victory. .

For the Panthers, it was their second
loss in a row to a nationally ranked con-
ference opponent, as they fell to the No.
20 West Virginia Mountaineers 90-79 on
Saturday.

In their search to even their win—loss'
record, the Panthers will stay on the road
and travel to face another Big East rival,

Many NFL pundits thought that Tebow

Yet the Denver'Broncos took a chance
