‘ u.s. Shedding The ‘vietnamsyndrome’ *

Vol.78. No.30

By JOHN GAMBESCIA

After two years of motions
and appeals, Pitt has ended its
legal battle with a clothing com-
pany by agreeing to an out-of-
court settlement. '

Pitt officials agreed last week
to settle theirdispute with Cham-
pion Products lnc., a New York-
based company, over its use of
Pitt‘s sport logos. Under the set-
tlement, the company agreed to
purchase from the university a
trademark license at a fee of$l00
but will not be required to pay
the 6 percent gross royalty fee
that is part of all Pitt trademark
licenses.

Champion, which has been
selling Pitt products since l936,
was not ordered to pay future
royalty fees because of a legal
trademark defense known as the
Laches Doctrine.

Ronald Talarico, assistant
universty counsel, said, “ln
essence, the Laches Doctrine
states that since the university
waited so long to file suit against
Champion [45 years], the royalty
policy does not apply.”

Under the license, Pitt did,
however, gain control of the
nature and quality of the goods
Champion produces.

Talarico said that the out-of-
court settlement was agreed
upon mainly because of the pos-

Trademark Saga Ends

sible implications the case might
have had on future trademark
laws.

In December of l98l, Pitt filed
an action suit against Champion,
charging trademark infringe-
ment. ln early l982. the case
went before the U.S. Western
District Judge Maurice B. Cohill
Jr., «who ruled against Pitt. Pitt
then appealed the case to the
Third Circuit Court of Appeals,
which unanimously overruled
Cohill‘s decision. The Appeals
Court sent the case back to
Cohill for further consideration.

In the spring of this year,
Cohill again ruled against Pitt
and declared Champion’s use of
the Laches Doctrine as a valid
defense. Pitt again appealed.

“ln Cohill’s second decision,"
Talarico said, “he made a sweep-
ing decision with broad state-
ments on the entire trademark
law.” .

According to ‘Talarico, this
decision was not specific enough
for the issues at hand and lent
itself to future problems should
other judges begin to interpret
his ruling.

Last month, Pitt filed further
motions to the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals.

The settlement made Pitt’s
latest appeal to the Third Circuit
appear moot and, more impor-
tantly, directed Cohill to vacate
his decision.

“It is as if someone were holdinga
knife to your throat and I came
along to help you. and the guy with
the knife says, “But that’s outside

the diplomtic correspondent for
U.S. News & World Report,
speaking in defense of U.S.
intervention in Grenada.

Migdail, Assistant Editor Joseph
Fromm and Foreign Correspondent
Robin Knight expressed their
opinions on President Reagan’s

current foriegn policy in a round ’

table discussion before the World
Affairs Council of Pittsburgh on
Monday at the William Penn Hotel.

Fromm and his collegues
proposed that for the past l5 years,
the U.S. has been laboring under a
“Vietnam Syndrome" — a fear to
take _a definitive stance in world
affairs because of U.S.

Fromm added that Reagan has
finally established a clear list of U.S.
policies and their «priorities.

The first priority, according to
Fromm, is an increase in the military
strength of the U.S. — both in
military power and perceived power.

politically impotent.

Fromm said he supported the
invasion of Grenada, adding that it
will send a message to Cuba and the
Soviet Union saying “that the U.S. is
going to hang tough and that the
Vietnam Syndrome is over.”

Reagan’s objectives is a pragmatic

has shown this by making consistent

decisions. Fromm cited Reagan’s
refusal to bow to pressure during the
embargo of the Soviet pipeline
despite the objections ‘of U.S.
multi-national corporations and
European allies.

Third, according to Fromm, is the
maintenance of a, hard-line policy
toward the Soviets. Fromm said he
sees “a new Reagan“ negotiating
style that is balanced and
well-defined.

“The Soviets are trying to drive a
wedge between the U.S._ and

Soviets, he added, welcome the
anti-nuclear protests in the west
because they help to factionalize

  Senate
Debates
Computer  
Monopoly

By NANCY POPKIN

A debate over whether the univer- ,

sity should rely on one computer
vendor for its future needs or pursue
other companies’ offers took up
much of yesterday’s Senate Council
meeting. *

Professor Paul Shepard, speaking
on behalf of the senate‘s Computer
Usage Committee, said that the uni-
versity is limiting its options/for
improving the current academic
computing system by dealing solely
with one vendor — the Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC). He
said that the committee no longer
believes that the university is look-
ing into offers from other
companies.

The debate centered around a
proposed co-research project
between the university and DEC
that would give Pitt substantial sav-
ings on computer equipment with a
list value of $8 million. Senior Vice-
Chancellor- Jack Freeman later
announced that the university hopes q
to finalize the multi-million dollar
project with DEC within the next
month. ~» C

When asked whv the universitvi.  -

hasn‘t pursued other possible ven-
dors during the negotiations with

DEC, Freeman said, “We-ididiinotm--:.i5.._i

wish to put any impedimentin the
way of achieving that [contract].”

Freeman said that the agreement
with DEC would not require the uni-
versity to purchase-any set amount
of equipment, nor would it limit’
computer purchases to the DEC
company.

Freeman called the relationship
between Pitt and DEC a “long-
standing partnership, highly visible
and important.”

Richard Butera, another member
of the standing committee on com-
puter usage, said that while DEC
may be the best company for some
of the university's needs, it is impor-
tant to remember that ‘people who
use Pitt’s system do so for various
reasons. A

The administration and faculty .
involved with the decision believe
that DEC has the best offered minis
computer and that the contract will '
be a model for other kinds of rela-
tions with other vendors, according
to Freeman.

Campus Housing‘ Presents Paradox

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

When Jeanine Haggerty applied
for university housing with Pitt last
fall, little did she know she was
entering one of the pitfalls of the
system.

“I applied for housing when 1 ap-

. plied to school, in ’October « or

November of last year,” Haggerty, a

transfer student from a Massachu-

setts nursing school, said. “They said

I would be informed later as far as
housing was concerned.”

But she was never contacted by
Pitt, and found out, only by calling
at the end ofJune, that there was no
on-campus housing available to her.
After finding an apartment in Oak-
land and starting school in the fall,
she received a letter saying there was

housing available for the winter
term.‘

“All they -said was, ‘you are eligi-
ble for housing for the winter term
—— do you accept or do you refuse?’l
refused because -1 have a year lease
on my apartment.”

Haggerty’s situation is not uni-
que. Many students who are turned
down for dormitory space in the fall
find there's room for them in the
winter. '

For one reason or another,
according to assistant director of
housing Bob Robinson, “We do
have a certain amount of people who
live here, who decide in the winter
term to leave.” .

“All the apartments in thearea
have a year's lease,” said one fresh-
man who: was also denied housing

for the fall but told he was eligible
for winter term. i
“All of the freshmen [denied hous-
ing] who came here are stuck in year
leases,“ he said.
This student, who prefers not to
have his name printed, said Pitt first

tried to send him to the Greenshurg ' *

campus; and once his application

was accepted on the main campus,’ '

he was sent a housing contract. After
sending in his application and $100
deposit, he found out he applied too
late and was 2l7th on the waiting
list.

He and his family travelled to Pitt
from the other side of Pennsylvania
in June and found the people at the
Housing Office “didn‘t evenrwant to
see us. They don’t like to "handle
these matters." -

B/ueso/ogist Captures History 

By BRENDAN BEARY

Although‘ most of Gil Scott-
Heron's music concerns political
issues, he prefers to call himself a
“_blues-ologist" rather than a protest
singer.

“The way I see it," he explained,
“a protest singer is someone who’s
on the outside looking in. But as
citizens and taxpayers, we have a
right to question what our govern-
ment is doing.”

Heron stressed the importance of
holding onto dreams at his Monday
night lecture in the the William Pitt
Union Multi-Purpose Room. A
capacity audience attended the lec-
ture, held in conjunction with Pitt’s
14th annual Black Week.’

“If you're walking down the
street,” he said, “and a person you’ve
never met before comes up and puts
his hand in your pocket, I don’t con-
sider it a protest to be inquisitive
about what he‘s doing. But the
government has its hand in your
pocket, so you have every right to
want to know what it’s doing with

‘ your money.”

The importance of the blues, he
explained, is that it served as a

: “chronicle of black history” in the
same manner that oral historians
. had served in Africa. Heron said

blacks tend to place more faith in

their own oral history rather than in
written history.

The electronic media go further,
he said, in making more pervasive
whites’ versions of news and atti-
tudes towardblacks’.

“Everyone on television programs
has a job,” he said. “There was only
one show on TV that talked about
unemployment. There you had a

black man, unemployed, with a wife
and three kids, living in a Chicago
slum. The name of that show was
‘Good Times.’ "

It is only recently in terms of black
history, Scott-Heron said, that writ-
ers such as Langston Hughes and
Sterling Brown have begun to com-
pile a written history of blacks in
America.

Scott-Heron praised the efforts of

Month to give young blacks a sense
of perspective of the progresses that
have been made in their behalf.

“Most of you are about 20 years
old,” he said, “and you think you got
here to college on the basis of your
own hard work and charm. Twenty-
five years ago, about the only blacks
you’d be likely to find here would
have been sweeping up, and you sure
wouldn’t have been able to find me
up here speaking to you all.

“You can’t tell a 20-year-old
about what it was like 25 years ago,
before the day when Rosa Parks
decided she was fed up with preserv-
ing the status quo. A lot of sacrifices
were made for you to be here where
you are today.”

After lecturing for just over an
hour, Scott-Heron took a brief
intermission, then reappeared to
perform some of his music. The
material he chose was politically
oriented, he said, “to urge you all, if
you haven’t done soalready, to reg-
ister to vote. You don’t have any
say-so in what goes on unless you
register.

“I’m telling you to register, not
because Jesse Jackson’s running for
president —— although that’s good —
but because that is your contribu-
tion tolthe community. If you don’t
vote, you have no place to
complain."

Knight said the U.S. must clarify
its position in Lebanon. Knight said
the Marines’ original purpose was to
get the P.L.O. soldiers out of the
country but that they are now trying

despite its lack of local support.

The U.S. must find a way to limit
the effectiveness of Soviet
disruption techniques, which have
included arming and training the
P.L.O. and Syrian Armies, in the
area, Knight explained.

Migdail said that Reagan must
maintain Latin American stability in
order to win the I984 presidential
elections. ‘

He said‘ the big fear in the Reagan
camp is that victory could be stolen
by a “crisis X,” just as former
president Jimmy Carter‘s bid'was
stolen by the Iranian crisis. Because
of this and the need to uphold
self-determination, Migdail said it
was necessary and proper for the
President to invade Grenada.

Migdail added that Reagan would
not invade Nicaragua during an
election year. He said that the
message to the world from the
invasion of Grenada was that the
,U.S. is not afraid to use force but
will only use it

Activist Dick Gregory Warns,

By MICHAEL WEINMAN

“I don’t know how you can drink
Coke and not taste all that blood.”
That was Dick Gregory’s condem-
nation of black American support
for companies that aid South Africa.
An overflow audience packed the
David Lawrence Auditorium last
night to hear Dick Gregory present
his views as part of the on-going

\+“§.-Black Week celebration at Pitt.

E}

Gregory condemned blacks (but
he intended his comments to be
taken by all people) for complaining
about the government, especially
complaints about Reagan, if they
haven‘t even registered to vote. Gre-
gory demonstrated that of the states
that Reagan carried in the Electoral
College, the number of unregistered
black voters outnumbered Reagan’s
margin of victory.

“Reagan doesn’t need to run-
...with four million unregistered
blacks, he‘s already won,” Gregory’

'\'€/said.

Gregory said that the country is
run by a handful of elites and that
the millions of people inthis country
could enforce their will ifthey knew
what scares this “ruling elite."

“If people really wanted to change
things, all they’d have to do is boy-
cott Christmas,” he said. “The next
time they wanted to invade a Gren-
ada, they’d have to ask Sears and

. Roebuck.

“Make the business_es feel your
anger, and the government will feel
it."

Gregory also condemned black
fraternities and sororities. He said

“Our policy is to acquire ham-
ware and software from any VCDUO"
we can at the lowest possible price,”
Freeman said.

A task . force was formed last
spring to insure that the innovations
in computer technology would ‘be
present in Pitt’s new computer
system.

The committee and the task force -
are not decision-making bodies.
They make their recommendations
to the senate and have one represen-
tative on the Executive Committee
on Academic Computing (ECAC),
which has
power. ECAC is made up of both
administration and faculty.

The Senate Computer Usage
Committee did agree with the uni-

1 versity decision to develop a com-

munications network that would
make it possible for different kinds
of computers within the university
to communicate with each other. It
is estimated that this project and the
DEC contractual agreement will
take three years to complete.

Shepard ended the meeting by
stating that they will approach other
vendors when the DEC contract is
set.

A representative from Pitt‘s
branch campus at Bradford outlined
some of the computing problems-
facing its administration, students
and faculty. Bradford students must
pay a_ user fee for access to the sys-

tem. The Senate Budget Committee -

is currently reviewing the need for
user fees here.

hood, then I would have to be some
thing less than a God-given human."

Gregory believes that even though
blacks can now attend schools with
whites, a free exchange of ideas is
not taking place.

“You can walk around here
together, but no one talks to each
other.”

Most of Gregory’s comments
dealt with what he believes is a
world-wide conspiracy to supress
blacks as well as whites.

Gregory believes the news is also
subject to this conspiracy. He said
that Walter Cronkite conducted an
interview with President Lyndon

 

\.

Americans ‘Dangerously Ignorant’

Johnson, in which Johnson admit-
ted to knowledge ofa conspiracy to
kill John Kennedy. 5

Nine days later, Johnson died,
and his references to the conspiracy
were cut out of the broadcast. Gre-
gory also read from a copy of the
Warren Report, which he saidis
being kept from the public. In this
report, Oswald and Ruby are listed
as having been on FBI payrolls.

Gregory also said he has evidence
that John Hinkley bought his gun
from the same gun store at which
Lee Harvey Oswald bought his. Gre-
gory contends that this store is an
FBI munitions front.

Gregory said he believes the U.S.
knew about the attack on the
Marines in Beirut before it hap-
pened but used it to mask the mobili-
zation of troops headed for
Grenada. He also believes that the
U.S. government was behind the
murder of Vicky Morgan, girlfriend
of late millionaire Arthur Blooming-
dale, a friend and associate of
Reagan.

Gregory said he has a copy of a
missing videotape that shows the sex

.acts of Morgan and Bloomingdale,

for which Gregory believes Morgan
was murdered. _
Gregory believes that the one way

to avoid this continued abuse of-

power is to get people registered to
vote.

“I wonder if you all know what the
real world is. All you people do is sit
here and play bullshit games,” Gre-
gory concluded. People, he said,
should be aware of the facts and not
just accept the world as the govern-
ment projects it. .

-A poor turnout marked the
first Student Government
Assembly ‘meeting between
representatives from student
groups.

Approximately 25 students

attended to discuss facing the.

organizations.

It was the first time the assem-
bly has been organized in several
years, and Student Government
Board member Jeff Schaffer said
he was “disappointed" with the
turnout. A letter was sent before

Schaffer said thelpurpose of
the Assembly was to “present to
the Student Government Board
a consolidated opinion of the
‘undergraduates concerning poli-
cies and positions concerning the
university or their organization.”

Allocation of’ funds was the
main subject that concerned the
students.

“One of the primary com-
plaints we get from the organiza-
tions is, ‘You don’t understand

Allocations Committee rep_re- -
sentative Mark Stabingas said.
“This can be a valuable forum‘
where [organizations] have some

‘Another issue that was raised"

at the meeting was the require.- . 1

ment that student groups who
have functions in the Student
Union must have two security
guards at the event. This stipula-
tion will beinvestigatea Iurtner.

Schaffer urged students to
look around campus and start
thinking about problems in the
university or their organization.

The assembly will be coordi- '
nated primarily by the newly-
elected SGB, who will take office
in January and meet twice a
term. The next meeting will be
held at the end of January.
Schaffer said he hopes with more
publicity and advanced notice,

more organizations will be
represented. “I think there are a
lot of areas where people in other
organizations can say, ‘Hey, we
had that problem, too. We
thought we were the only ones.
This is what we did,’” he said. “It
will be up to the new board to get
people motivated for this.”

Strict Standards

\

The City of Pittsburgh public schools have adopted
a strict standard for its interscholastic athletes, which,
if abided by, can help raise the quality of public educa-
tion considerably. ' .

The new policy requires that students who partici-
pate in athletics earn grades of C or better in five

. subjects, excluding physical education. Students are
able to take up to seven subjects at a time and must
also be promoted to the next grade in order to play
football, basketball, baseball and the like.

This year, the rule only applies to ninth graders, but
it will apply to all students by I986.

While this new policy may seem too strict for some
and ineffective to others, the philosophy behind it is
smart and should be seriously considered‘ for imple-
mentation by other school districts in the area as well
as other schools in the nation.

Our society has high regard for student athletes who
excel on the field but not in the classroom. Often times,
academic performances are overlooked or grades are
ﬁxed in order for a student to be eligible to play on a
team year after year and have winning seasons for the
school.

Some students also ignore their own academics in
high school because an athletic scholarship is some-
times the only way for them to afford college, espe-
cially those students in low socio—economic areas.

By adopting these standards, Pittsburgh public
schools are saying, Hey, we believe in high academic
standards for our students and especially for our
athletes.” V

There is so much being sacrificed today in the name
ofa winning team and season. Classroom learning and
retention are much more important than throwing a
football or hitting a baseball.

Reports have been'issued and "studies have"‘been
conducted about the decline of the quality of Ameri-
can education. High school students are scoring low
on their SATs and are havingproblems with the “three
Rs.”

We are not saying that all athletes have academic
problems, but by putting a standard such as the one
imposed by the Pittsburgh School District, students
will think twice about what’s more important: athletics
or academics.

If a student is serious about playing football, basket-
ball or any other sport, he is going to make a concerted
effort to keep his grades up and be a better student.
After all, that is what ‘school is all about.

Nobody is sure how the new policy is going to work;
only time will tell. But by having these standards,
maybe the quality of American education will begin to
rise again. The student who learns to be a good student
in high school will carry those qualities to the college
classroom and also be a boost to the institution of
higher education he chooses to attend.

Athletics are important to youngsters; they can ‘

learn competition and good sportsmanship, but
athletics should not take precedence over classroom
learning.

Grenada Invasion.

Two Schools OfThought 9

By MAURICE A. MALLIN

In Grenada, U.S. ‘forces

responded to a Cuban takeovereof -

this tiny island, evidenced not only
by the Cuban presence there but by
the massive arms buildup and the
recently uncovered documents de-
lineating Russo-Cuban plans for
controlling the island.

This action has engendered two
schools of reaction. Each school has
at its starting point a different ques-
tion; each question leads to a line of
reasoning arriving at different con-
clusions. One school asks: Did the
U.S. have the right to. break interna-
tional law and encroach on the sov-
ereignty of Grenada, at it did
vis-a-vis the invasion? This question
ultimately answers no and leads to
condemnation of the U.S.

My concern is with the second

train of thought. At its starting point I
is the question, was there a real ,

danger to the U.S. in Grenada,
thereby justifying the rescue mis-
sion‘? The answer to this school’s line
of reasoning is, ultimately, yes.
Each school begins with different
assumptions. The former assumes
that no nation ever has the right to
encroach on another nation's sover-
eignty. The second assumes that a
nation has a right — indeed. and
obligation —— to respond to a threat.
The problem is that the first
recognizes the second
school’s perspective only after a
direct threat against the U.S. Since

‘Fighting For

Dear Editor: A
Marty Willis’ Nov. 2 column puts
me in mind ofthe debate which took

’ place in the Oxford Union (Oxford
-University) in I933, shortly after -

Hitler came to power. The young
men of that debating ‘forum, the
future leaders of Britain, voted over-
whelmingly for the proposition
“That this House refuses in any cir-
cumstances to fight for King and
Country.“ They were convinced that
no cause, no national interest, no
ideal was worth the risking of one’s
neck. Of course, their complacent
pacifism was shattered by Hitler's
I939 invasion of Poland. And these

A same men did fight for king and

country — a fact for which all of us
who despise Nazi ideology should be
thankful.

Like the men of the Oxford
Union. Willis appears convinced
that no ideals are worth fighting for.
His column strongly implies that
between the political systems of the

that is at present a fairly unlikely
prospect, the first school dismisses
the second school as irrelevant.

This reveals a naive approach to

global politics. Some basic facts-

today: "There are two camps, the
communist and the anti-communist.
Even a cursory, superficial examina-
tion of communistedoctrine tells us

that the former camp is committed --

to the destruction of the latter. This
will be accomplished not necessarily
through military means; it may be
done slowly, over time, through eco-
nomic or propagandistic measures.

While a military victory would be
most expedient, the West would not

allow it. Thus, communist nations"

rely on means to which the West is
reluctant to respond because it is not
absolutely clearthatthe communists
acted. The West traditionally
bemoans its complacency when it is
too late. —

. If a Western leader recognizes
that the communists rely not only on

their military but on all the resources --

available to them in furthering their
goals, he will be lessinclined to wait
until he is directly threatened before
helwill act.

In Grenada, the threat was of a
military, if indirect. nature. Fact:
The Cubans (_Cuba is one ofthe few
countries allied to the Soviets *by
choice.) were all over Grenada. and-
their presence means a Soviet pres-
ence. Since the Soviets lead the com-
mUmStS. we can deduce that there
was a threat to the United States.

This ‘very real danger justified the
mission into Grenada. /“u
Still, many do not recognize this
fact. But claims of breach-of--
sovereignty fall flat. Sometimes sov-
ereignty must‘ be breached. One can
not always take action after one is
attacked. Sometimes a nation must
act pre-emptively, as the U.S. did.
No one likes it; but sometimes it has
to happen. It is certainly worse to
allow threats to build up around you
on many fronts, in many ways,
because you are afraid to act. 

It is unrealistic to think that the
“loss” of Cuba, Nicaragua and yet a
third country in this region is tolera-
ble. It is not, especially in light ofthe
fact that the Cubans were not wel-
come in Grenada. There was no pop-
ular communist revolution; nor was
there a democratically elected com-
munist party. There was a Cuban
takeover, and the United States
rescued Grenada. Why do so many
find this unacceptable‘?

It is as if there is a gut reaction
which says, any action the US. takes
is devious: the U.S. must wait until it
is threatened with a missile labelled
“U.S.S.R.” before it may politely
raise a finger in objection. But then it
will be too late.

The second school of thought,
then, finds the Grenada mission a
logical reaction to a real threat.
Most importantly, a strong message
is sent to the Soviets: “No More
Paper Tiger."This reduces the possi-
bility ofthat missile’s coming at us in
the first place.

Both King And Country’

United States and the _Soviet Union
there is little moral difference. That
anyone today can believe this —
after exposure of Stalinist purges,
state-induced famines and the Gulag
Archipelago — astounds me. But if
this is the case with Mr. Willis, I
suggest he read Solzhenitsyn or chat
with the families of those who died
on Korean Airlines Flight 007.
The fighting between U.S. and
Cuban troops on Grenada was inev-
itable and long overdue. Cubans
under Castro had become willing
mercenaries of the Soviet Unioir'(it
is estimated that support of the
Cuban economy costs the Soviets
$4.5 billion per year). Castro‘s
troops were first employed in
Angola in I975. Since then, they
have appeared in Ethiopia, Nicara-
gua and Grenada. Wherever local
discontent could be exploited,
Cuban troops appeared to insure
that the victors were sympathetic to
the U.S.S.R. Clearly they were test-

ing U.S. resolve. Our failure to act
against Cuban troops in the mid-’70s
insured their continued use as Soviet
proxies.

Should we feel guilty about our 
intervention in Grenada? Of course
not. By the standards that we apply
to legitimate government — that it
rule by law and with the consent of
the governed —— neither Maurice
Bishop nor his successor Austin
Hudson (or Bernard Coard — it was
never clear which one) had any right
to “govern Grenada.

Hudson assumed control ofGren-
ada by a coup in which Bishop and
many of Bishops supporters were

murdered, apparently with the con— V»;-.

sent of the resident Cubans and
Soviets. Were we to accept the word
of such a man that Grenada would
not be used as a Soviet military base
and that American students on the

island would be unharmed’?

Debating Scores

Good Marks
In Virginia

The William Pitt Debating ‘'
Union traveled to Harrisonburg,
Va., this past weekend for the
James Madison University Invi-
tational Debate Tournament.

_ In the varsity division, sopho-
more "Bob Kraig and freshman
David Dillen compiled a 6-2
record in the preliminary rounds
and reached the quarterfinals.
Kraig and Dillen defeated teams
from St. Johns, Navy and West
Virginia, among others, before
losing a 2-1 decision to Alderson-
Broddus College in the quarters.

In the junior varsity division,
freshmen Nancy Walker and
Amos Mazzant reached. the
semi-finals before bowing to Lib-
erty Baptist College. Walker and
Mazzant also were _6-2 in the pre-
liminary rounds.

Mazzant won 9th place in the
division among 60 participants.

Fighting
For King

continued from page four _
President Reagan acted decisively
against a clearly brutal and illegiti-

mate government. He did so to pro- .

tect American lives and restore
democracy. He used U.S. troops to
accomplish a clear-cut mission well
within the military’s capabilities.
Both the American students and
Grenadian people seem extremely
' grateful for his actions. This opera-
tion will probably insure that the
Soviets will be much more cautious
in the future use of Cuban troops.

Will we be able to restore democ-
racy in Grenada? Mr..Willis is skep-
tical that this can be done at

gunpoint. That it is difficult I have _

no doubt, but that it is possible is
attested to by the continuing
prosperity of democratic Japan and
West Germany.

Several years after the aforemen-
tioned Oxford Union debate, Hitler
remilitarized the Rhineland (March
7, I936) in contravention of the

Treaty of Versailles. If the French

had marched into the Rhineland, the
Germans would have had to with-
draw, in which case Hitler would
likely have fallen from power. Three
years later, Germany was the strong-
est power in Europe, and she
crushed France'in a lightning cam-
paign in the spring of I940. Perhaps
ifa man of Ronald Reagan’s convic-
tion and will to act had led France in
the ~l930s, this tragedy would not
have occurred. I ask Mr. Willis to
consider this.

On Campus Housing, A Paradox

continued from page one

“They said there’s nothing they
can do, that housing was filled, but
they’d let us know."

While freshmen are not guaran-
teed housing at Pitt as they are at
some colleges, they consitute 39 per-
cent of the residents in Pitt dorms.

“If we guaranteed housing, the"

residence halls would be 90 percent
freshmen,” Robinson said. “You
have towork out _a balance there
somewhere.”

The remainder of the 4,l49 beds
available to Pitt students are taken
up by sophomores, 30 percent; jun-

iors, 20 percent; and seniors, ll-

, percent.

Upperclassmen who have already
lived in the dorms are given first
preference in which dormitory and
what type of room (single, double,
etc.) they want. Freshmen receive
housing on a first-come-first-serve

‘I basis.

dents who are already residents
draw a number to determine the
order in which their applications will
be processed.

I “There are a series of ‘good’
numbers,“ Robinson said. “Usually
with the exemptions and the beds
available, females get approxi-
mately l,0O0 beds. Numbers
between one and l,000 are good
numbers.”

Providing that not .all of the
“good” numbers are drawn, there
will be more beds available, thus
making the “good" number line
higher. maybe up to l,400. Usually
the people who draw numbers up to
l,55O have their applications pro-
cessed and receive housing, accord-
ing to Robinson.

According to Robinson, the
rumor that if you receive a “bad"
number, you won't get a room isn’t
true. All of the 3,656 students who
went through last‘ year’s lottery
received housing, ‘and all. 357 stu-
dents on the waiting list received a
dorm bed as well.

tery system has been used. Robinson

essing applications a “nightmare.”
“There was a date when applica-
tions were available and every stu-

dent got one in the mailbox,” he i

said. “If you were a student whose
mailbox section was stuffed first,
you had an hour or two jump on
everyone else.” '
“Not only that, but think ofa line
of 2,400 people at the Cathedral of
Learning. It was mass confusion."
Much of the problem, he said, is

students who don’t get a “good”

number assuming there's no way
they’ll get a room.

“A lot of people get very upset,

when they don’t get a good number,”
he said. “We try to explain to them
that the number will be good ifthey
are patient-. Sometimes people get
frustrated when they don’t get one
immediately.“ »

While the system gives upper- in

classmen the first choice in the lot-
tery, it is more difficult for
commuting upperclassmen or stu-
dents who have lived in apartments
and want to move into the dorms.
The best way to enter the system,
Robinson said, is during the winter
term when some students move out.

Unmatched Record
Comes To Rest

By MARK;A. SINDLER

The day and the field conditions
were nondescript, but the memories
make for lively fireside chats.

In November 1952, Pitt soccer
coach Leo Bemis and a rag-tag
bunch of players played an all-star
team from the Western
Pennsylvania area on a field in

Beadling, then located between
suburban Mt. Lebanon and
Bridgeville.

The plush carpeting of snow
forced the lining of the field with
coal dust.

Those were the primitive days ofa
sport that has only known one man
as its head coach: Leo Bemis. That
continuity has ended, though, with
the retirement ofa bespectacled man
who had served in that capacity for
over three decades.

After 30 years, Bemis reminisces
over the rocky beginnings, the
numerous people whose lives he has
crossed and the many memories that
make for invaluable storytelling.

Depending on what is considered
his official starting point, though,
Bemis may likely erase the legendary
Doc Carlson’s (I923-53, basketball)

mark in holding Pitt's longest
coaching stint.
After being appointed

intramurals director in I947, Bemis
promoted soccer as a club in 1952
when “several fellows expressed an
interest beyond the intramural
level.” Two games were played that
year, one against Slippery Rock IV.
and the one in Beadling. , V. V

Bemis vividly-recalls the seedling
stage of what is now a varsity-level
program.

“Gil Simon, Don Clark [two
intramural players] and I sat down
in the Field House and talked _about
it,” the Penn Hills resident said.
“They expressed a lot of interest. I
then went to the athletic director
[Tom Hamilton] and asked him if it
would be all right to continue on a
club level." .

, Along with theaffirmative answer
came $ I000 for expenses. Two years

later, after some players’ urgings,"
Pitt soccer had its start as a varsity

sport.

“He asked me who I’d think
would be interested in coaching,"
Bemis said of a conversation with
Hamilton, “and I said, . ‘I’m
interested.’ "

But behind that “interest" lurked
almost more responsibility than

Bemis could handle. At the time, he
had no student assistants in the
intramural program to aid in
budgeting or leadership. He taught
five or six physical education classes
each day and was working on a
doctorate in physical education.

” Something had to give. Thrown
overboard was the doctorate and
pulled in was the emphasis on an
infant sport. '0

“Tom said you started it, so why
don’t you go ahead and do your own
scheduling,” Bemis remembered.
“He said, ‘All I can say is I feel if
you're going to play, play the best
you can play. Ifyou’re going to lose,
you’re going to lose to the best.

“ ‘If you win, then you beat the
best that you can.’ I’ve always
followed that.”

Bemis only sought out matches
against “tough” schools, like North
Carolina, Duke, Michigan State and
St. Louis, and accordingly, he
needed experienced players. The
small football players that he
recruited from intramural football
just were not enough.

But the soccer played in high
school was limited to the spring
only, coached by football coaches
who oftentimes used their players in
the spring sport to keep them fit. In
the process, there was no incentive
for other potential athletes to try
their foot at soccer.

But after Bemis hounded the
Pennsylvania Interscholastic
Athletic Association for several
years, a vote by high school coaches
moved the sport to the fall during
the late-l960s.

“ Instrumental‘ in the 4-3 vote
favoring ‘the autumn exclusivity
were Fox Chapel soccer coach Ed
Boyle and Springdale’s Dave
Maloney, now a backfield coach
there.

»The

participation by the potential
athletes and let them grow
accustomed to play during the

college season.

“I tried all kinds of things down
through the years,” Bemis said. “I
tried to convince these people to

switch it out of the spring. I knew '

superintendents and athletic
directors I played college football
with. '

“But they were football people;
they simply didn’t want any
competition in the fall. They just
wanted to keep it football."

Consider the late-60s the sport’s
starting gate in Pittsburgh because

Pitt head soccer coach Leo Bemis

after that, soccer burgeoned in the
area. In the first half of the 1970s,
Allegheny County hired English
soccer coach Chris Wright (current
general manager of the Pittsburgh
Spirit) to aid in developing youth
soccer. County support increased
youth participation in. soccer (by
providing fields) from 2,000 or 3,000
in I975-76 to 10,000 in four or five
years.

In the late l960s, the Western
Pennsylvania Interscholastic
Athletic League had about six
soccer teams. Today, the number is
48.

Obviously, the swelling is partly
Bemis’_doing, his earlier hounding

. paying off. It wasjust the “sheer love

for the sport” in him, he would say.
Therefore,‘ it may be a bit unclear
why he‘s leaving something he so
dearly loves.

A mixture of early retirementand
mandatory retirement turned the
trick. In January I982, the
university offered the former for
tenured “professors. Bemis had
earned ‘tenure as an assistant
professor back in the l950s. He
signed up last December for the
program, one year short "of his 65th
birthday. ‘ .

At that milestone,» Athletic
Director Edward Bozik also will

require retirement.

Upon reaching this retirement
junction, Bemis and soccer,
together, will have uniquely
survived at a school that stresses
Division I football and basketball.

“It has a lot of problems,” Bemis
said of the competition for
recognition. “It’s hard to. get the
student body interested and aware
that._you’re around. All non-revenue
sports are battling this. -

“But I’ve never had a problem in
finding lots of fellows interested in
playing soccer. It's not like we
struggled ;along with I4 or 15
players.” _

In fact, two of Bemis’ former
players accrued All-America honors
while at Pitt. One, Ron Wyatt, is
now the soccer coach at Allegheny
Community College, and the other,
goalie George Zanic, is presently
Churchill High School’s soccer
coach, _

Nowadays, Bemis. usually has
28-30 man rosters._Tliese came along
.with the West Penn Conference,
which Bemis helped create in I970.
All it took to establish it, he said,
“was talking _to a couple of friends."
The I I-team conference was started
13 years ago, three of those years
having been championships for Pitt.

 End 
Season

By TIM DINGER

A touch of irony spilled from
Monday’s soccer match between
Pitt and Indiana University of Penn- ,
sylvania. By losing at IUP 4~l, the
game not only marked Pitt coach '
Leo Bemis‘ last one before retiring
but brought back memories of his
first victory as a coach. —\

Pitt won that match by a three-
goal margin.

By losing to West Penn Confer-
ence champion IUP, Pitt ended the
regular season at 9-I0-l. -

“We played even most of the
game,” Bemis said, “but we misseda
couple of goals we should have had,
and they just outscored us.”

IUP jumped in front early with a
goal 10 minutes into the game. Pitt
came back to tie the contestwhen
senior Greg Komoroski scored on
an assist from Rich Burkholder 27,
minutes into the first half. ,

The score remained deadlocked
until midway through the second
half when «IUP scored, never again
relinquishing thelead. "

Two goals with under I0 minutes
to play insured the win.

“Our goalie

Dave ' Torrence

played a good game even though__he

gave up four goals,” Bemis
remarked. “But we were pushing our
defensive people up‘ to score, and
that leaves you open for counter

,' attacks.

“They were too tough ofa team to.
give up too many opportunities.” ‘

A major thorn in the ‘Panthers’
side was IUP’s Frank Wolk, who
scored two goals, breaking~IU,_P,’_s-
record for career goals scored. '

Another reason Bemis believes

Pitt lost is because the team received; 
news Sunday nigh-t that it was not 

selected to be a part of the Big East -
Final Four. :
“It sort of knocked the air out of

us. but the kids still played to win.” '0

The kid on the left lost his‘
contact lenses. Actually,
Allegheny College and the
Steel Clty rugby team
matched heads recently,
Steel Clty winning the con- .
test 12-7. ‘

There has been an invasion in
many college football press boxes in
recent weeks. These visitors are not
dressed like the usual occupants, as
they wear bright sportcoats of yel-
low, green and orange with emblems
sewn on the left side. They look on
with crossed fingers and sweating
palms. '

These men are bowl scouts,
observing many of the top college
teams in the nation. Their goal is to
find“ the right combination for their
bowl games, so they can insure high
television ratings and good attend-
ances, which means big bucks.

' Pitt has put itself back into the
bowl picture with its 2l-l6 victory

over Notre Dame last Saturday. But.

the Panther faithful should not be
ready to reserve plane tickets to such
popular holiday resorts as New
Orleans, Dallas, Tempe or even
Jacksonville.

Although the win at South Bend
has created renewed enthusiam over

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 9, i983.

the Panther fortunes, there are many
factors which could keep Pitt out of
a major (read: high-paying) bowl
game.

First, is the opponent to face
Nebraska in the Orange Bowl —- or
the national championship game,
take your pick. At this point, Miami
is the front runner, currently ranked
fifth in the nation and sure to move

up one spot, with No. 3 Auburn fac-_

ing No. 4 Georgia at Athens this
weekend. The Orange Bowl commit-
tee would like to have Miami as
much as Los Angeles likes having
smog. With the Hurricanes playing,
the committee and the city stand to
lose money in the deal.

' But, if Miami is the highest
ranked team, the Orange Bowl will
have little choice but to invite them.
Their only hope is that Florida State
upsets the Hurricanes.

Another problem for Pitt is teams
that are in other conferences. Texas
— unless.something drastic happens
— will be the Southwest conference
champion and the representive to
the Cotton Bowl. Illinois will visit

the Rose Bowl, and the Auburn- 3

Georgia winner will spend New
Year's Night on Bourbon Street.
That leaves several teams —— South-
ern Methodist, lowa, Ohio State,
the Auburn-Georgia loser and Flor-
ida —— ahead ofthe Panthers in both
polls. Which probably means these
teams are ahead of Pitt in the minds
of bowl scouts.

A third problem — both Mary-
land and West Virginia defeated Pitt
earlier in the season. Quite possibly,
these teams could sneak ahead ofthe
Panthers.

And Boston College still lurks in
the shadows. The Eagles are 7-1 , and
right now, considered to be the top
team in the East. The Fiesta Bowl
thrives on Eastern teams and their
rabid, money-spending fans, but
whom do they choose — Boston
College at l0-l or Pitt at 9-2 with the
big reputation. '

As usual, the bowl picture is as

cloudy as a January day in Pitts-

burgh. And it is hard to see where
the Panthers fit in.

Rule the Cotton Bowl out. They
are still a little bitter over last year’s
performance against SMU. Ditto

for the Sugar Bowl because there
should be a higher ranked-team than
Pitt.

The best bets are the aforementi-
oned Fiesta and the Gator Bowls.
Both have had the Panthers in the
past eight years. A natural rnatchup
would be Pitt and North Carolina in
Jacksonville, while a rematch with
SMU could be possible in the Ariz-
ona sun. .

Of course, the Pitt fortunes could
change within the next two games.
The Panthers need a good offensive

When a swimming team loses two

performers who combined for six

All-America honors and i4 school
records, the nucleus of a squad that
won the Big East championships
and finished l8th in the nation, its
reasonable to expect that the head
coach will be crying over the situa-
tion. The fact that 20 Of‘_thC 23 cur-
rent swimmers are freshmen and
sophomores having little or no expe-
rience at the collegiate level, doesn’t
make it any better.

Lady Panther head coach David
Belowich is not destitute, however.
Nor is he moaning over the loss of
the services of Jan Ujevich, who
graduated, or Sue Heon, who is tak-

ing a year off to train for the i984,

Summer Olympics.

“I’m more excited over this year
than I've ever been," he said. “We'll
be a stronger team than last year.”

The reason Belowich can make
such a statement is that for the first
time since he took over for Dick
Bradshaw three years ago, the Lady
Panthers have some depth. The
benefits of two straight outstanding
recuiting years — both in quality
and quantity —- are starting to show.

“The loss of Jan and Sue would
have devastated most teams,” Belo-
wich said. “But this team said, ‘Well,
we have to do better,’ and wehave.

  '‘ t‘t«'01I)..:,,..~,-.a...-.=w..,r~ . r.

A The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 9, i983.

“We going to have more ofa team
effort this year: The team is eager to
learn, test themselves and accept the
challenge of Division 1 swimming.
I’m pleased with their progress so
far."

One freshman, Susan Hickman, is
being relied on to take the role in the
sprint events that Ujevich had. Hick-
man was ranked first in the 50-yard
freestyle for l7— and l8-year-olds.

“Susan is bringing more to the
team," Belowich said. “She’s learn-
ing how to work hard in practice.
Her attitude has benefitted the
team.”

Other freshmen expected to con-
tribute are backstroke specialist
Tracy Pfister of Bethel Park, breast-
stroke and individual-medley com-
petitor Jodi O'Neil of Rochester.
N.Y., distance freestyler Stacy
Moller of Upper St. Clair, middle
distance freestyler Christine
Kaucher of Reading, Pa., and but-
terflyer Nahir Perez, a native of
Puerto Rico.

Sophomores Wendy Morgan,
Alicia Dugan and Nordine Burrell
are also expected to perform well.
Morgan has recovered from a bout
of mononucleosis to bolster the
sprint breaststroke event while
Dugan will help out in the freestyle
events. Burrell‘s speciality is in the
butterfly events. '

\

“They are not having a sopho-
more slump," Belowich said. “They
are moving ahead from where they
left off last winter. They understand
how to win at the college level.‘

“We don't‘ have a weak event.“

The three upperclassmen. senior
co-captains Maggie Curry and
Denise Sedlacek and junior Laura
Barber, have shown a positive influ-
ence on the younger swimmers.

“They have all the things you are
looking for in upperclassmen,"
Belowich said. “They are super role-
models for the team to look to. They
provide leadership by example."

Another plus for the squad is the
addition of a full-time graduate
assistant, a position which in the
past was shared with the Panther
swimming team. Sandra Bizal was a
four-time All-America swimmer at
Penn State andis continuing gradu-
ate work in exercise physiology, the
field in which Belowich has a
doctorate.

“She really enjoys Pitt,” Belowich
said. “if she felt this way five years
ago, she would have been at Pitt.

“Sandra has been an asset to me
and the program.”

One problem that could plague
the team is the practice routine;
swimming lap after lap since the
beginning of September is monoto-
nous. Belowich has varied practices
by having an intra-squad dual meet

and a “football game," where yards
are gained depending on laps times,
but the team is hungry for dual-meet
competition.

Fortunately, the Lady Panthers
will get their chance this Friday
against Kent State at Trees Pool,
starting at 4 p.m.

“Kent State will be a nice test, not
from a win standpoint —- we have
more talent — but for the experience
of competing in a dual meet,“ Belo-
wich said. “They need to be tested.”

The Lady Panther diving team
has already competed this year, tak-
ing third place at the Penn State
invitation Diving Meet the week-
end of Oct. 28-29. Like Belowich,
coach Julian Krug has a roster full of
youth — four sophomores and two
freshmen.

“The detriment to the team is that
thevidivers have not been with the
program very long  Krug said. “We
don't have a leader system.

“But we’re going to do extremely
well anyway. l‘m looking for brigh-
ter things in the years to come. They
could develop into the best team
ever in diving.”

Two years ago, Krug was desper-
ately searching for divers to com-
plete the roster. Now, he has the
depth he needs.

“its unusual having this large a
number of divers,” he said. “I do
believe their being so close in class

helps out in the team pulling
together."

The standout in the Penn State
invitational was sophomore Tricia
Schultz, who finished sixth on the
one-meter boards and third in the
three-meter event.

Two newcomers should also help
the team. Jennifer Brown, a transfer
from Monroe Junior College in
Rochester, N.Y., has been diving
well, according to Krug. The bright-
est freshman prospect is Tricia Ney,

who finished second in the one- ' '

meter event at the Pennsylvania
State Championships. Ney, who has
been deafsince birth, is an outstand-
ing diver, according to Krug, but has
been set back due to a bout with
mononcleosis.

The Kent State meet will give the
Lady Panthers a chance to compete
in‘dual-meet competition but little
else.

"Kent State won’t provide tough
competition,” Krug said. “But they
will give us a chance to compete in a
dual-meet setting."

Bemis, who has compiled an
aggregate I70-l 76-38 record
through the end of this year, does

not see himself in any prima donna'

terms.

“Its been the only mark in soccer,
so it’s hard to make comparisons,"
he said. “lt’sjust been my enjoyment
of working with young men as part
of their total experience here at the
university."

As president of the Western
Pennsylvania State Youth Soccer
Association, Bemis will continue in
a similar coaching capacity starting
this spring. ' He plans on
volunteering his accumulated skills
while working with WPSYSA
youths.

Pre-season ‘Round-
ball....

The Big East women's basket-
ball coaches have voted Villan-
ova the .pre-season favorite to
win the conference title and

' named Pitt‘s Jennifer Bruce pre-

season Player of the Year.

The Lady Wildcats, selected
first by five of the nine coaches,
totalled 59 points to edge defend-
ing champion St. John‘s by
three. Villanova finished fourth
in the conference last year as
injuries plagued the Lady Wild-
cats all season.

This year, three returning star-
ters and a freshman class ofthree

Sports Brief

high school All-Americas point
to a solid outlook.

St. John's enjoyed a best-ever
record of 23-6, which included a
first-round game in the NCAA
Tournament. The Express have
four starters returning but must
replace conference Player of the
Year Debbie Beckford, who
averaged 21 ppg.

Pitt was third in the coaches
poll while Seton Hall and Syra-
cuse tied for fourth. Providence,
Boston College, -Georgetown
and Conncecticut complete the
balloting.

Bruce, the Big East’s returning
scorer, averaged 20 ppg last year
as well as nine rebounds and shot
56 percent from the field. Bruce
and Villanova guard Nancy

Bernhardt were unanimous
selections to the coaches‘ pre-
season all-conference first team.
Syracuse center Chris Palombi,
Providence forward Kathy Finn
and St. John's guard Janet Roos
complete the first team squad.

Like Bruce, Bernhardt and
Finn were all-conference first
team selections last season.

Villanova‘s Shelley Penne-
father was selected pre-season
Rookie of the Year and was
joined by classmates Lynn Tighe
and Karen Hargadon on the six
player all-rookie team. Others
selected were Kathy Sweert (Bos-
ton College), Kelly Leibens-
perger (Seton Hall) and Doris
Sable (Providence).

The Big East Final Four Tourna-
ment takes the four teams with the
best records to compete in a playoff,
deciding an eventual champion.
Connecticut, Providence and Bos-
ton College had already clinched a
berth prior to Sun_day‘s vote by the
coaches, leaving. the battle for the
final spot between Pitt, Syracuse
and St. John’s.

The first round of voting saw Pitt
receive four votes, Syracuse garner-
ing three and St. John’s two, elimi-
nating the Redmen.

In the second round of voting,
both coaches voting for St. John's
shifted to Syracuse, giving the
Orangemen a 4-3 edge over Pitt.

Although the Panthers did not
make the Final Four," Bemis was

 

generally encouraged by the season‘s
outcome.

“We went into our season with a
very young team, and we played two
very tough teams [George Washing-
ton and George Mason]," he said,
“without adequate practice in pre-
season.

“We played them for exposure
and experience. If l had the chance
to do it over again. I’m not sure if l
would or wouldn't drop those two
teams.

“We didn‘t achieve all the goals
that we had this year, but we did
build in experience with our young
players. As for looking down the
road, Pitt should have a good team
for the next couple of years."
