“Vote for Bals, the Total Package,”
said one neon—colored T-shirt.

“Annie Get Your Crown,” said
another.

Some students wanted to “Fist
Pump with Alex.”

Is this change one can believe
in? 4

These slogans might not have
the power of change, but they

could drive students to vote for
‘ their favorite candidates during

today’s Homecoming elections.

At least, that’s the goal.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
and Jack Smith, president of the
Alumni Association, will crown
the the King and Queen at Sat-
urday’s football game-, out of a
court of 10 candidates announced
after tomorrow night’s ﬁreworks
and laser light show. To get a spot
on that court, 16 students vie for
votes as part of what some con-
sider a-popularity contest.

Others — both past winners
and organizers — are trying to
combat that perception.

Although the candidates have
been campaigning for the past
few weeks, some students don’t
think the process is pertinent to
campus life.

The Blue & "Gold Society has
taken steps to make the royal cou-
ple a more active part of campus,
said Elaine Lewis, vice president
of Traditions for the Blue & Gold
Society. ‘

Candidates debate for House seat

Social Security, gay marriage and tax reform spark heated rebuttals

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

The three ‘congressional :candi-
datesiaiming to represent Pitts-
burgh debated —— and often dis-
agreed — yesterday afternoon.
The debate, held at Brashear
High School in Beechview, fea-
tured Democratic Congressman
Mike Doyle, Republican candi-
date Melissa Haluszczak and
Green Party candidate Ed Bortz
in an hour—long event hosted by
the League of Women Voters-of
Greater Pittsburgh. Jon Delano,

anchor at KDKA, moderated the

debate. -
Questions — supplied by high

school students — varied from

' Social Security and taxes to the

drinking age.
The candidates occasionally

. edged over the lines of the de-

bate’s rules when discussing some
of the more contentious issues.

_ Bortz and Doyle disagreed with

Haluszczak on Social Security,
gay marriage and tax reform.

. The candidates started to f
trade barbs over Social Security
and used up their rebuttals.

Doyle said that Halus-zczak,

like other Republicans, intends
to put the Social Security fund
in the stock market.

 r “The Republicans have some
ideas for Social Security, they’re

V just all bad ideas,” he said. “This

party wants to privatize the sys-
tem, they want tovinvest Social
Security funds in the stock mar-
ket.”

Design for I1€Wi
restaurant approved

Shaé Felicien C

.Staj_‘fWri ter

Eat’n Park Hospitality Group met
with the Art Commission of Pitts-
burgh yesterday afternoon and re-
ceived ﬁnal approval for the project
on Schenley Plaza. Construction
could start soon and will likely be
ﬁnished by spring.

The restailrant — which  yet
to receive a name — will be on the
grassy area of Schenley Plaza clos-
est to Hillman Library, next to the
carousel. It is‘ expected to seat 150
guests indoors as well as 40 to 50
outdoors. ' “

In order to build anything on city
property like Schenley Plaza, design,
architectural and landscape features
must be reviewed by the Art Com-
mission of Pittsburgh.

The design of the proposed res-
taurant had been a noted concern of
the Art Commission in the past.

“The largest concern for every-
one was that this needed to be a
high-quality facility and it needed to
integratewell into the park and not
encroach unduly upon pedestrians
or frequent users of the park,” Public
Art Manager Morton Brown said.

The hospitality group has made
several changes to its development
plans since it originally met with the
commission in April. It lowered walls
and alloted for more open spaces.

“We didn’t want to block any
views from the lawn and we didn’t
want people‘ inside to feel that they
were enclosed — the whole point
is for therellto be movement and
iritegratiorifi’ said Natalie Byrd of
LaQuatra,}1,_,c},!),:nci Associates, the ar-
chitecturafﬁrmlthat helped design
the building.

The design also includes a num-
ber of features that build a transition

between the restaurant and the park
in order to incorporate the entire
area — such as an outdoor ﬁreplace
thatwill be open to the patio guests
as well as those seated-inside.

The restaurant also has environ-
mentally friendly additions —— such
as a sedum roof, rain water collec-
tion barrels and specialty tables

made of reclaimed wood. It will also A

strive to lessen the use of synthetic
materials.

“It is not an Eat’n Park restau-
rant, it is a completely new concept
for us,” said Andy Dunmire, Eat’n
Park vice president of Design and
Construction.

With -the fall quickly coming to
a close, some have considered how
construction might impact park
programs and students studying for

ﬁnals. The hospitality group said it’s ,

aiming for an efﬁcient and minimal-
istic irnpact during the construction
process.

“It shouldn’t be a noisy construe
tion —— with the construction there
are noise ordinances in place,” Dun-
mire said. “Certainly we don’t want
to impact programs in the park so we
are trying to get construction done
ahead of time.” 4

According to Art Commission

meeting minutes from April 28, the '

full-service restaurant will serve

breakfast, lunch and dinner. and fea-

ture wood—burning/oven-rotisserie
style food of mid-price range, $10-
$20, that can accommodate guests
dining in or out.

At least one student seems opti-
mistic about the plans.

“If I’m hungry, I might as well
go there — especially if they’ll take
Panther Funds,” sophomore Rachel
Browning said. ‘‘It’s convenient,
not too pricey and a great place to
grab some sun when the weather
is nice.” -

Onorato urges Pitt students to vote

Onorato 4 1

universities in Pennsylvania.

“My goal is to keep four—year colleges af-
fordable so that students don’t come out with
piles of debt,” Onorato said.

When asked after his speech about the
problem of young graduates leaving Pitts-
burgh after college and moving outside of the
state to ﬁnd jobs, Onorato said that Pennsyl-
vania gets a lot of federal research dollars that
can be used to lead to employment.

Through research projects, ideas are cre-
ated which lead to spin-off companies. These
companies often move outside of the state,
but Onorato said that Pennsylvania needs to
create room for these companies to start and
grow in the state. .

Onorato also said he wants to work with
small businesses as well as women and minor-
ity entrepreneurs to foster companies.

Marcellus Shale drilling stands high among
potential job creators in the state over the next
few years. He said he supports the drilling,
especially since itwill create 80,000 new jobs
over the next 18 months.

Kelli Vandergrift, the president of the
Pitt College Democrats, said one of her main
reasons for supporting Onorato is because
she supports his plan to create jobs and stop
cutting taxes for companies overseas.

He wants a competitive severance tax,
which will be used in part to fund inspectors

HAPPY

 
._ 2  F

and make sure all -regulations are being en-
forced. Corbett has stated publicly in the past
that he would not support a severance tax.
“Corbett is simply wrong on this issue,”
Onorato said in regards to Corbett’s stance
on the severance tax. '
Onorato said that severance tax is not a
party issue, since all other states that have
Marcellus Shale drilling also have a tax.
Onorato’s one demand for the private
corporations that are leasing the land is that
they must hire Pennsylvania residents forthe

jobs dealing with Marcellus Shale. He said .

that Pennsylvania community colleges and
vocational—tech schools will train students
for these jobs.

“These are our jobs, the gas is under our
lands, and we should get these j obs,” Onorato
said. .

John Berris, public relations chair for the
Pitt College Republicans, said he supports Cor-
bett because of his pledge not to raise taxes,
when Onorato has not made such a pledge.

Onorato also brought up the issue of health
care, and his support for the current health~
care system that has just beenrput in place by
President Barack Obama and Congress.

He said he has watched deductibles rise,
coverage worsen and premiums increase by
20 percent every year.

“This is about doing what’s right and not

responding to corporations,” Onorato said.

Berris said that Corbett took measures to
prevent the passage of the new health—care law
— along with other U.S. Attorney Generals —
on the grounds of it being unconstitutional.

Onorato also highlighted his plan to reform
the Pennsylvania government by downsizing
the legislature.

“N 0 one is going to tell me there’s no room
for improvement,” he said.

Onorato spent the ﬁrst 20 minutes of his

speech describing his background with Al-
legheny County and laying out the differences
between himself and Corbett. This was then
followed by a question-and-answer session

"with the audience.

Onorato stressed multiple times that he
was the elected executive of the second—largest
county in Pennsylvania — a county that has
“created j obs and weathered the storm much
better than most others.”

Allegheny ‘County is consistently below
state and federal unemployment levels, On-
orato said. He credited this to the assets that
the area has, including its many universi-
ties.

Onorato ended by telling the room of stu-
dents that “it’s your generation that they are
predicting won’t show up to vote. There is a
lot at stake, and no matter who you vote for

, make sure you get out to vote.” I

and further alter the fund as needed.

Bortz proposed an alternative solution
— lift the cap on social security taxes and
pump more money into the program from
other portions of the budget.

“I think it does. need to be put in a lock
box, and contributed to with other funds
from other departments when there’s ex-
cess, like the Pentagon,” he said.

The debate closed with applause — and
a few boos — from the student audience. 1

Homecoming 4 1

“The King and Queen will be more ac-
tive this year than in years past — for ex-
ample, they are required to make a visit to
Children’s Hospital with their crowns to
bring a little cheer to the children there,”
Lewis said.

Lewis said the royal couple do not have
any responsibilities in addition to the hos-
pital appearance. The candidates also do
not need to be affiliated with any chari-
ties, or systematically keep track of past
winners’ philanthropic actions — leading
some students to question the role of the
Homecoming Court. -

Homecoming elections began as a popu-
larity contest in March of .1931. The Pitt
News — then called The Pitt Weekly -
published a story encouraging students to
vote for the campus ing and campus queen
of popularity.

Although the titles have changed to
Homecoming King and Queen, some stu-
dents say the process is still inﬂuenced by
the same concept.

Pitt senior Benjamin Gregory, a com-

Some students question
role of candidates

munications and rhetoric major, said he
agreed, but does not see a negative side.

“The elections are definitely a popu-
larity contest, but I don’t-think it’s a bad
thing,” he said.

Dalya Akyuz, 2009’s Homecoming
Queen, disagreed.

“I really don’t think it’s a popularity
contest,” she said. “I don’t think I was
one of the most popular girls on campus.
I always introduce myself and say ‘hi’ to
people. I’m approachable. I always make
myself available to people. I think that was
the difference.” ,

Akyuz studied marketing at Pitt and was
a member of the Delta Zeta sorority. She
promoted the Make—A-Wish Foundation
and ran under the slogan “Support a Child’s
Dream  Vote Dalya for Queen.”

Lewis said that many candidates don’t
necessarily raise money for the philan-
thropies they promote — instead, they
find alternative ways to contribute, such
as participating in events sponsored by the
organization they are supporting. I

Students don’t need royal blood to be
crowned Homecoming King or Queen,
but they do have to meet a few require-
ments.

Each candidate must be a full-time un-

I dergraduate student in good standing with
the University and have a cumulative GPA
above 2.5, said Elaine Lewis, vice president
of Traditions for the Blue & Gold Society.

Candidates must also have the sponsor-
ship of a SORC-recognized student orga-
nization on campus, Lewis said.’

For the past few weeks, the 16 candi-
dates have campaigned around campus to
garner support from student organizations
and local businesses.

They also spoke to fellow students
about what they hope to achieve and why
students should vote for them. Candidates
have tabled on campus in the past, and oth-
ers have petitioned student organizations
for endorsements.

Although many candidates choose to
base their campaign on a philanthropic
organization, Lewis said that this is not a
requirement this year.

Homecoming candidates because the

Greek population on our campus is in-

volved in all aspects of campus life, Lewis
said.

Even though membership in a Greek

1 organization is not a requirement, in the

past three years almost all King and Queen

Process of becoming royalty

Greeks are likely to be involved as

victors have been members of Pitt Greek
Life.

The Homecoming Queen in 2007, Mia
Dragoslovich, was the only Queen or King
winner in the past three years who was
not a member of Greek Life at Pitt. She
was active in the Pathﬁnders organization I
and was a resident adviser in Litchﬁeld
Towers. ‘

Students can begin voting at noon today
on my.pitt.edu. The top 10 candidates, or
the—Homecoming Court, will be announced
tomorrow after tomorrow night’s ﬁreworks
show. On Saturday, the court members will
meet at the William Pitt Union at 9:30 a.m.
and proceed to Heinz ﬁeld together.

The court will partake in the “March to
Victory” parade at 11 a.m. before the foot-
ball game at Heinz Field. Every candidate
chosen for the court is part of the parade.
Members of the Homecoming Court will
pair together in the parade based on al-
phabetical order, Lewis said. ‘

After the royal couple is chosen, they
will receive crowns, but not much else.

Lewis said the Homecoming King and
Queen have one speciﬁcduty within their
roles as the royal couple — they must visit
Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC
in Lawrenceville. She said that does not
diminish their presence on campus.

“We encourage the King and Queen to
be a strong representative of the University
in their everyday life,’’ Lewis said. I

EDITORIAL-

Voting for the 2010 Homecom-

ing King and Queen starts
online today, so we thought it
would be appropriate to edu-

cate readers on the origins of
this time-honored tradition.

The following is an excerpt
from the March 6, 1931, edition

of The Pitt Weekly, the origi-

nalform of The Pitt News, in

which the plans for the ﬁrst-

ever Homecoming election were

announced. Enjoy.

 

The big contest is on!
Throughout the halls of the

various buildings in the Univer-

sity today students will vote for

and coed in the first Weekly
‘Panther Popularity Contest.
Every student on the cam-
pus, no_ matter what his stand-
ing may be, is eligible to vote.
He will obtain his ballot slip
at any of the tables stationed
inthe various buildings. The
student will write the name of
one student of the opposite sex
who, in his opinion, is the most
popular. Thus,the men will vote
for a coed; the women will vote
for a collegian. The ballot reads
-as follows:
‘On the basis of my own per-

the University of Pittsburgh,
devoting uninﬂuenced by scho-
lastic achievement, or organiza-
tion affiliation of that person, I
cast one ballot for the student
of the opposite sex who is most
popular with me. Name ———— --
[...] As to what constitutes
popularity is left for the student
to decide. It may mean person-.
ality, that indeﬁnable ‘it,’ or it
may mean, as a professor at
Yale has put it, ‘stimulus and
response value.’ It may mean

i that the voter’s choice always

has a smile on his face, is op-
timistic, and always willing to
‘help. [...]

Speculation is rife among the
fraternities.

Rarely can such a direct way
of discussing the actual goings-
on behind Homecoming elec-
tions be found these days, so we
appreciate that our predeces-
sors could identify it more than
three score/years ago. As you
can see, some campus realities
don’t change.

In the decades that have
elapsed and in the hundreds of
thousands of students who have
earned Pitt degrees since the
initial ballots were cast, today’s
Homecoming election essen-
tially remains as it was founded
— a popularity contest.

Yes, in recent elections some
candidates have used their can-
didacy to promote community
service, but tying Homecoming

been a halfhearted effort.

Unlike years past, there
simply are no charity require-
ments anymore, according to
Elaine Lewis, vice president of
Traditions for the Blue 8:‘ Gold
Society.

After almost 70 years of
giving out crowns and not ex-
pecting anything in return, it’s
time for a change. If they pro-
fessa highly developed sense
of Pitt pride, campus Kings and
Queens should represent more
of what we care about — phi-
lanthropy. ‘ 3

The Coalition of Urban and
Metropolitan Universities’
2009 “Saviors of our Cities” list
didn’t rank Pitt in the top-ﬁve
schools for community service
for nothing.

With all of the attention the
Homecoming election process
vies for and receives from the
student body, an unparalleled

our surroundings and the qual-
ity of life_ for Pittsburghers in

tour a hospital can’t tap that po-
tential. But there’s still time for
current and future candidates
to change that. I

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

' Iwas very disappointed to read
Andrew Kaback’s article “Hairy
lessons from Europe” in Tuesday’s
paper. I don’t disagree with Ka-
back’s argument that the United
States should be wary of proﬂigate
spending. But the article relies on

. played-out stereotypes and shows
ignorance, or at least gross misrep-
resentation, of the economic reali-

' ties of its main target, France.

Kaback references the most
overused clichés of the French: un-

. shaven body hair and a penchant
for surrendering. That’s all you got?

What a wasted opportunity. Kaback
dulls what should be a compelling
argument for addressing the se-
verity of our ﬁscal difficulties with
a disdain founded on superﬁcial
stereotypes that are irrelevant to
France’s economic status.

The jabs- about the Frenchbeing
lazy, on the other hand, would at
least be relevant to Kaback’s argu-
ment if they were in any way based
on fact. The French don’t strike
because they want to get out of
work; in France, going on strike is
an expression of worker solidarity
that has its roots in the upheaval of
the Revolution. The French don’t

choose to work only 35 hours a
week; the 35-hour work week was
a national economic policy ﬁrst in-
stituted to create jobs. By the way,
according to The Conference Board,
GDP per hour—worked in France is
90 percent of GDP per hour-worked
in the United States, which places
France’s productivity just above that
of Germany and well above that of
the EU as a whole.

It’s too bad Kaback didn’t
ditch the disdain and look a little
deeper.

But, inchoosingti1isstate’snextrep-

Q your ballots in favor of someone other
than Dan Onorato for governor.

_ It’s not that the current Allegheny
County commissioner hasn’t delivered
onhispromises. Propettytaxes haven’t
goneup duringhis tenure. That’s pretty
much been his primary talking point.

But in catering to his known con-
stituents — older residents —— he’s ig-.
nored the rest of us. It's smart politics,
but underhanded and disingenuous'to

. those of us vvithoutAARP cards.

As a self-proclaimed champion of
‘ ﬁscal responsibility, according to his
website, Onorato’s policies have shuf-
ﬂed costburdens onto college students
and younger Pittsburgliers in order to

M ﬁmd bloated programs like the Port

Authority transit system, instead of
ﬁnding sensible means of lowering
the overall costof operation. In early

2008, Onorato institntedalo percent
tax on poured alcoholic beverages as

I well as new taxes on hotel stays and

rental cars to bridge a $26 million gap

in the infrastructure.

After raising $45 million with the
tax,ti1e county governmentloweredthe
taxto sevenpercentto compensate for
overtaxing citizens. To add insult, On-
orato suspended those funds thatwere
meantforPortAuthorityworkerssohe

- could leverage union negotiations.

Clever? Perhaps. Opportunistic?
More like backhanded. Much like the
restof0norato’s county commissioner
career? Absolutely — especially con-
sideringthatatthe time the ﬁmds were
accumulated, the county hadn’t paid
out a cent to those workers for more
than18 months. *

Thetaxtargetedbar—goers—man
of whom are students — who already
pay to use the bus system with tuition
money. It’seasyto exploituswith sucha
tax, of course, because we’re tradition-
ally the least responsive voter group in
the county.

Last year, The Pitt News reported
that just 10.8 percent of registered
voters in Oakland cast ballots, despite
Mayor Luke 'Ravensmhl’s aggressive
push at the time to tax tuitions to
fund government pensions. A couple
hundred students —-— myself included
— had to ﬁght for our rights in City

Onorato for long enough

Council’s chambers because no one
took it upon themselves to mobilize
and vote the guy out of oﬁice when we
had the chance.

Surely, Onorato publicly decried Ra-
venstahl’s approach, but he levied for
anotherthat differed onlyinsemantics.
Hissuggestiontothe mayorforﬁllinga
$15 million pension gap involved ask-
ing the area schools to donate money
as if we didn’t contribute more than a
fair share alreadyvvith rent, taxes and
commerce. Onorato’s county budget
plan calls on doing the same thingto
ﬁll $4 million in missing funds.

Onorato stayedrnumon most other
points of contention that camehisway
— including much of the post-G-20
controversy. He praised the success
achieved in bringing an increased in-
ternational presence to the city but,
again, ignored those of us who felt as
though we were mistreated, whether
we interacted with the police or not.

Theanarchistswho contributedto

THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID

African room brings in relevant culture, history

 
    
 

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

Porching it last Thursday night after a —

four—hour study session in the Cathe-
dral, some friends andldiscussed the
various merits of our schools Nation-
ality Rooms. Whenwe reached theAf—
rican room inour discussion we were
faced with a conundrimi: Why does
Lithuania get a whole room to itself,
whilethe entire continent of Africa is
condensed into one little classroom?
It didn’t seem fair. At least upfront, it
seemed likeanalmost condescending,
gross oversight.

Understanding the genesis of the
continental cultural room requires
a little backtracking. According to
Pitt’s website, interest in establish-
ingaroomforthe African community
began in the 1930s, but it didn’t fully
evolve until 1972. That year, a com-
mittee was formed under the chair-
manship of Walter Worthington to
create an African Heritage classroom.
Because the African—American com-
munity came from all over Africa, the
committee decided that incorporating
several cultures into one room would

To balance

Brown 4 9

be less exclusionary than choosing
a single country to model the room
after.

That’s why, like the Israeli room,
the African classroom is referred to

I as aHeritage Room, ratherthanaNa-
tionality Room. The policies of the
Nationality Rooms required that the
history depicted in the room predate
1787, the founding of the University
of Pittsburgh. In 1987, Dr. Laurence
Glasco, a Pitt professor of African-
American history, traveled to Ghana
to research room prototypes. The
room is designed after an Asante
Temple courtyard, which is a com-
mon architectural archetype seen in
different communities throughout
Africa.

The design also incorporates
themes from other cultures — aWest
African “Queen Mother,” a lectem
stemming from a Benin stool, and a
Nigerian carved chalkboard, among
others. The entry door’s wooden pan-
els depict nine ancient and medieval
African kingdoms: Pharaonic Egypt,
Nubia, Ethiopia, Benin, Kongo, Mali
and more.

E. Maxine Bruhns, director of the
Nationality Rooms and Intercultural

Exchange Programs at Pitt, said that
the African Heritage Room represents
more than historical heritage; it also
represents highly personal stories. 2
The room was the product of a
grassroots movement, with dona-
tions dating back to when the Uni-
versity’s Black Action Society collected

displaying individual nationalities or
ethnicities?

Bruhns said that the Nationality
Rooms Committee wanted to plan a
Latin American continent room so
that the African;[Heritage Classroom
would not be “all alone” in represent-

ing a single continent. _But time, space

Rather than presenting ajj-glossed-
over history of Africa, the room ,

incorporates many heritages. ’

$208.95 at a1973 fundraising dance.
The campaign planning coordinator,
NancyH. Lee, spentlsyears collecting
more than $250,000 to construct and
dedicate the room, as well as extra
money for summer scholarships for
Pitt students studying in Africa.

“Itwas ahighly personal joumey,”
Bruhns said. “I still water Nancy’s
potted plants on the Cathedral’s 12th
ﬂoor.” 

But still: Why did the room have to
compartrnentalize the African conti-
nent into asingle space, as opposed to

ect never came tofi'uition.,'I‘h‘at’s the 1

If you go to a movie theater, you’ll get
one horror ﬁlm. If you go to Pitt Rep-
ertory Thea1:re’s play “Slasher” you’ll
see the guts of many of horror ﬁlms
splattered onto the stage.

“Slasher” takes a satirical twist on
scary movie clichés. The stereotypical
last girl standing has to face her fears

along the way, the villain is overplayed
and melodramatic and there is enough
fake blood to satisfy any horror ﬂick’s

The showbyAllison Moorewilltake
over the Charity Randall Theaterinthe
Stephen Foster Memorial and literally

bring the audience on stage, up__.close
and personal with the bloody effects
and the story, according to director
Holly Thuma.

The play is not meant to parody
speciﬁc movies so much as the genre
as a whole, even though it speciﬁcally
references a couple of ﬁlms, including
“Scream.”

“Basically, it’s about ayoungwoman
livinginasingle—motherhome,”Thurna
said about the show. “The mother is a

and alcoholic. As she begins to work

When maldngthe stage for “Slash-
er,” Thuma opted to make the theater
represent aﬁlm set. The crew uses the
set—up and lighting to give the entire
theater a haunted house feeling in ad-

dition to making the audience feel as ,_

if they’re on a movie setwith the main
character. . I

The fake blood is rampant, but

satire, which means “Slasher” is acom-
mentary as well as entertainment.

“Plays may just be entertaining,
but some plays have meaning and are
relevantto our lives,”Thuma said. “We

fumpkins tasty in fall treats

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

Pumpkins are inextricably important to
ﬂialloween, so why not enjoy them for more
than just]ack—o’—lanterns and make scrump-
tious pumpkin dishes? .
Let’s smash these bright orange gourds
into smithereens and cook with them.
For practicality’s sake, buying canned

pumpkin puree is perfectly acceptable, but ‘

for a fall kitchen adventure you could try
making your own.

Slice a fairly large pumpkin into eight
sections, and set pieces on baking sheets.
Cook them in an oven at 300 degrees. Start
checking them after an hour — it may take

-an hour and a half — and remove them
when the pumpkin becomes tender.

Allow it to cool for about 30, minutes
before scooping‘ the pumpki£1“.»""-"if  ﬂout of

mixer and voila, your very own pumpkin pu-
ree, chock—ﬁ1l1 of vitamins and nutrients.

No need to buy separate pumpkins for
Jack-o’-lanterns either. Just wait until the
day before Halloween or morning of to
carve your pumpkin so it doesn’t rot, then
make the puree the following day. .

And don’t throw out the seeds. Roasted

with some salt and paprika, they’re a great
fat—free snack, comparable to sunﬂower
seeds. Just spread them out on a sheet of
tinfoil in an oven or microwave oven and
season to your heart’s content, then bake
until crisp.

Armed with pumpkin puree, your op-
tions for usage are endless. Here are just a
few tasty treat options to make pumpkin a
splendid part of your diet.

With one simple batter recipe you can
make pumpkin bread, muﬂins or mini
muffins. You are constrained only by the
limits of your imagination and baking re-
ceptacles.

Pumpkins for breakfast? Absolutely.
With a few ﬂips of the wrist, pumpkin
pancakes are a delicious morning. meal

' If pancakes from scratch don’t appeal
to you, you could make regular ones from a
box and serve them with a pumpkin dip.

For a dessert without baking and sub-
sequently minimal effort, try pumpkin
cheesecake. Strictly speaking, you could
use fat—free cream cheese, but its usage is
thought to be a cardinal sin and the most
unacceptable of diet cuts.

Group dances on Capitol Steps

Capitol Steps

Byham Theater

In December 1981 — a time long before “The
Daily Show,” “The Colbert Report,” or Tina Fey’s

1 weekly impressions oftl1en—Gov. SarahPalin —- a

handﬁil of Congressional staffers were mocking
Capitol Hill. '

They decided that for their upcoming office
Christmas party they would perform songs and
sketches thatwouldparodyﬁgures and events that
were currently in the news. Much to the surprise
of the staffers involved, their performance was
positively received, and thus, the Capitol Steps
were born. -

Almost three decades later, the troupe has
grown in size to include 30—some members and
has recorded 33 albums — their latest, Liberal
Shop of Horrm, was releasedinMay.

“With the drastic changes in size and stature
have come many changes in how the group oper-
ates,” co—founder and co—writer Elaina Newport
said. The Capitol Steps are a ﬁxture on public ra-
dio and have performed for ﬁve U.S. presidents.
Now they’re coming to perform for a Pittsburgh
audience.

“When we started, we all worked on Capitol
Hill,” Newport said, “and for the ﬁrst 15 years we
had a strict rule that you had to have worked on
Capitol Hilltojoin... Today, we’re about half—and-
half—— halfforrner Capitol Hill staffers and half
Washington—area performers.”

Although there have been many changes in
personnel both within the Steps and within the
political arena that the group satirizes, Newport
feels that they’ve managed to handle each of the
challenges that have been presented to them.

“We used to worry that Congress would be-
come quietly competent and solve all the prob—
lems, and we wouldn’t have any song material,”
Newport said, before adding, ‘We worried about
that for about ﬁve minutes.”

Mark Eaton, a co—writer and performer who

joinedthe Capitol Steps in 1993, agrees with this

I assessment. He stated that “everyone likes to see

politicians tom downto some degree, andbecause

of that, there’s always going to be something out _

there.”

The songs thatthe Steps perform largelyfollow
the “Weird Al”Yankovic formula and range from
parodies of show times (“Obama Mia”) to disco
songs (“Hillary Will Survive”).

While Eaton says that“the best songs typically
take a halfhour to write lyrics for,” the process of
actually ﬁnding songs to match the topics them-
selves tends to be a little more difficult.

“Sometimes there is a song we’d love to use
but have to wait for a story,” Newport said. “For
example, ‘Don’t Cry ForMe Argentina’ was asong
we liked, but until the Governor of South Carolina
hadascandal involvingArgentina, we had no rea-
sonto use it,” R

Eaton, however, sees a different problem in
regards to ﬁnding songs for use inparody. _

“It’s really pretty diﬂicult to ﬁnd a popular
song that everybody’s familiar with these days. I
actually think the most recent song that we did a
parody ofwas the ‘Macarena,’ and thatwas inthe
19905. Nowthatthe Internet’s made it so youcan
have your own station to listen to, we’ve had to
startworrying about using asongfor parody too
manytimes, because there’s onlyso muchpopular,
familiar material to mine,” she said.

Partofwhathas made the Capitol Stepssosuc—
cessﬁilistheirunique abilitytostay steadfastlybi—
partisan in their lampooning of political ﬁgures.

“We’re like America,” Eaton said of the Steps’
political leanings. “We have some lefties, some
righties, and even afew I—don’t—cares. We’ve man-
aged to have someﬁinwith being so diverse, too,
where well maybe have someone who really likes
acertain Democrat have to singasongthat makes
ﬁm of them or vice versa. In the end, though, it’s
really just about making the audience lau ”

Andwhile many humorists feared that Barack
Obama, whose public persona is practically the
reverse image ofhis predecessor’s,would usherin

. aneraofprofessionalismwherepoliticalcomedy

would cease to exist, the Capitol Steps feel that
politicians will never stop providing them with
fresh material.

“It’s true,” Newport said, “it’s a constant chal-

ever happen again. Then someone in Delaware
says ‘I’m not a witch!’.and you’re back on track. .

The construction of a haunted house — es-
pecially one the size of Hundred Acres Manor,
located in a sprawling expanse of South Park -
is a yearlong endeavor. Just ask art director and
operations manager Ethan Turon.

“Literally, the daywe open there’s wetpaint on
the walls,”'I‘uron said. ‘-‘It’s abigproductionto get
to the point we are at right now.”

Hundred Acres Manor, which contributes to
the charities the Homeless Children’s Education
Fund and Animal Friends, is divided into ﬁve dif-
ferent sections in an attempt to target each par-
u'_cipant’s phobias. . .

“Every individual’s scared of diﬂerentthings,”
saidT1‘1ron, addingthatthe Manorwill“give every-
body an opportimity to get the living hell scared
out of them.” ' L

To ensure this, 'I‘uron said, each section has a
diiferentangle: Massacre Mansion (“atraditional

 _ haunted house, but it’s amped up”); SouthValley_

Hospital (“ifyou’re afraid ofthe doctors,this is not
aplace you want to be”); Site-R(“pict1’1re going 
throughboot camp and somebody’s saying, ‘you’re.,
dirt, you’re garbage” ’); the Maze (“ittakes forever
to ﬁnd your way out”) and the Grindshow Bazaar
(“even if you’re not scared of clowns, this section
of the haunt is extremely intense”).

While the array of scare tactics Hundred Acres
Manor employs may seemdizzying,'Iuron said he
ﬁnds the simple pleasures most satisfying.

For the Pitt News

The Pitt football team will look to
remain the only undefeated team
in Big East play this week when
it faces the Louisville Cardinals
at Heinz Field. V

The Panthers are coming off
big wins over Syracuse and Rut-
gers to top the conference at 2-0.
-Louisville is also riding high af-
ter knocking off the Connecticut
Huskies, a team picked by some
to bea dark-horse for the league’s
title. .

The Cardinals, much like the
Panthers’ first Big East opponent
Syracuse, are much improved
from residing near the bottom
of the conference in 2009. New
head coach Charlie Strong has
the team playing competitive
football —- their biggest loss was
by eight points to Cincinnati, in
a game in which the Cardinals

blooming star running back, Bilal
Powell. Powell leads the Big East
in total yards, with 1,003, and
total touchdowns, with 10, after
never topping 400 yards rushing
before this season.

“It says a lot about our offen-

-sive line because they are block-

ing really well,” Strong said. “I
have always said they are the glue
of ourfootball team.”

“They have a very good offen-

sive line across the board and two"

good tight ends,” Pitt head coach
Dave Wannstedt said. “Their run-
ning backs are running the ball
with more consistency. By that, I
mean numbers. If you look at the
number of times they’re running
the game and their possession
time, they’re committed to run-
ning the football. They have good
schemes.”

. Pitt’s defense has begun to
emerge over the past two games

tack -— as a challenge. Louis-
ville’s running game against the
Panthers’ run defense will be the

‘main battleﬁeld in this Saturday’s

contest.

“You look at [Pitt] against the
run. They are No. 1 in the confer-
ence and No. 9 in the country in
stopping the run. Only two teams
have rushed for over 100 yards
against them — Miami and Utah,
both games which they lost,”
Strong said. “We have a good run-
ning back and a good running
game. We feel like we can go run

the football and it is going to be

a tremendous battle for us.”

Some ideas for sports Halloween costumes

Greg Trietley
‘ Senior Staﬁ'Writer

 

When it comes to Halloween,‘ I’m

in it for the candy. I’m not one for —

costumes and all that — which is a

_ problem, because I need a costume

in order to get candy.

Thankfully, sports are, as always,
here to help. They’re an untapped
source of excellent get-ups. And the
best part? The costumes are simple
to put together.

Whether you’ve been invited to a
Halloween party at the last minute
or are just in it for the Necco Wafers,
here are seven instant costumes from
the world of sports. T

Instant Costume #1: A Mous~ .

tache

The moustache may be the most
versatile costume option. There’s
the “Rollie Fingers,” the “George
Parros” and the-“Michael Phelps Fu
Manchu.”

The clear winner for a Pittsbur-
gher, though, is the “Wannstache,”
which couples a moustache with
over—ear headphones and a polo
shirt in order to emulate Pitt football
coach Dave Wannstedt.

An underrated ’stache option,

though, is the “Bill Mccreary,” which‘

works well for those who also have a
referee shirt in their closet. You can
call party fouls all night. '

Instant Costume #2: A Beard

Abeard is a step up from a 
.tache, as fake ones are tough to find
and only a magical gene allows you to
grow a real one. If you can pull iﬂoﬁ;

though‘ — and if you haven’t shayed .

 

in a while, you’re already done 7;
then all of playoff hockey is at yoiii‘

' disposal.

Grab a hockey stick and go. You’re
Scott Niederrnayer, Henrik Zetter-
berg or Max Talbot. If you don’t have

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Big East full of parity right now

Pitt jumps to top of this week’s league power rankings

Donnie Tasser
Stajf Writer

 

Holy upset, Batman! In the third week in a
row that the nation’s No. 1 team was upset
—- this time it was Oklahoma losing to No.
11 Missouri -~ the Big East was also shaken
up by things that I, for one, did not foresee
in my crystal ball.

Syracuse goes into Morgantown and
knocks off No. 20 West Virginia, the only
ranked team in the conference, and now
everything is all topsy—turvy. ‘

Anyway, here are my current power
rankings, which reflect the madness that

happened last weekend.

Power Rankings

Pittsburgh — Two weeks ago, I — and
the rest of the country, for that matter ——
had given up on the Panthers and dismissed
them as one of the most disappointing
teams in the nation. Two games and 46
points later, the Panthers are in the driver’s
seat of the Big East. The offenseoand de-
fense have both playecliextremely well in
blowout wins over Syracuse and Rutgers,
and it seems that quarterback Tino Sunseri
and receiverjon Baldwin have ﬁnally found
a groove. Also, the win over Syracuse looks
all the more impressive after the Orange
beat West Virginia. As the only undefeated
team left in conference play, Pitt controls
its own destiny. ‘

Syracuse —— The Orange have actually
been sighted in the “Others receiving (Top-
25) votes” category this week. Syracuse,
knocking on the door to the Top 25? Wow.
That’s all I can say. They stuffed WVU’s
offense in allowing zero points after the
first quarter, and effectively turned the
conference upside down with the upset.

Quiet the turnaround following a big loss .

to Pitt.

West Virginia — The Mountaineers, far
and away the conference’s strongest all-
around team all season, were completely
shut down by Syracuse. Quarterback Geno
Smith was intercepted three times and
now the conference is once again without
a Top-25 team. It is uncharacteristic for a
WVU team to have trouble scoring points,
but they have averaged only 17 points dur-
ing two conference contests.

Louisville — The Cardinals, led by run-
ning back Bilal Powell, blew out a reeling
Connecticut team and find themselves
inching toward a bowl game. Powell took
the Big East rushing lead over UConn’s Jor-
dan Todman by outperforming the Husky
this past week. The Cards are now 1-1 in
conference play and could turn heads with
a road upset of Pittsburgh this week.

South Florida — B.J. Daniels finally
woke up. The underachieving QB woke up
and ran all over Cincinnati in another Big
East upset. South Florida’s defense gave up
a whopping 590 yards against the Bearcats,
but the offense had more than enough
points to make up for it. 1

Cincinnati — The Bearcats gave up
38 points to a team that hadn’t scored a
touchdown in its previous two games. Cin-
cinnati’s 13-game conference win streak
— the third longest of all time — was
snapped and their dramatic turnaround
from a dreary start was stalled in their
loss to South Florida. Not even Zach Colla-
ros’s 463-yard, three—touchdown day could
overcome the defensive lapses.

Rutgers — The Scarlet Knights are
physically and emotionally spent after
the last several games, and their bye week
couldn’t have come at a better time. They
had just played two overtime games in a
row and then got blown out by Pitt, all
with the Eric LeGrand tragedy hanging
over their heads. Quarterback Chas Dodd
was sacked 14 times between the Army
and Pitt games, and they displayed zero
offense against the Panthers, going into

halftime tied 14-14 and leaving Heinz Field ’

a 41-21 loser.

Connecticut —— The Huskies are in
shambles. Their starting quarterback, Cody
Endres, was suspended from the team last
week, starting guard Erik Kuraczea left,
their new quarterback was ineffective and
their star running back underperformed.
Randy Edsall’s team is in the midst of a
straight nose dive, and their 26-0 loss at
the hands of Louisville represents rock
bottom. ,:

Last, but certainly not least, I gener-
ously hand out my hardware.

Offensive Player of the Week: B._]g
Daniels, QB, South Florida ‘:

The multitalented quarterback has been
under fire all season, but he silenced critics
with a huge game — 13 of 16 for 286 yards
and two touchdowns passing and 35 yards
and two scores on the ground — helping
the Bulls notch their first conference win
in an upset over Cincinnati.

Defensive Player of the Week: Bran-
don Lindsey, DE, Pittsburgh

Lindsey has filled in well for the’ in-'
jured Greg Romeus. He led a Pitt defense
that terrorized Rutgers’ quarterback Chas
Dodd and stiﬂed receiver Mohamed Sanu,‘
gathering ﬁve tackles, four for a loss, three
sacks, and a forced fumble.

Play of the Week: Jon Baldwin’s one-l
handed catch at the Rutgers 1—yard line.‘

wear —— although you‘ can don an all-white
Wimbledon look —— but about your voice. The
Telegraph registered a Sharapova tennis shriek
at 103.2 decibels. If yclu can pull off a convinc-
ing (loud enough) yelp, your friends will ﬁnd
it hilarious. "

Instant Costume #4: Brett Favre
‘' “Trick or treat  or trick  I’ve always had a
love of treats  but I need to spend more time
tricking  or treat  or trick.  or treat  or
‘maybe join the Vikings...”

Instant Costume #5: Troy Polamalu j

V If I had one word to describe pipe cleaners, it
would be “miracle.” If you have enough of them,
you can twist them together to imitate Pola-
malu’s massive mane of hair, and then leap over
bushes, sprint across crosswalks and hurdle
the odd offensive lineman or two.

Instant Costume ‘#5: Ajersey

Thisﬁlthidea is alazy one. Throw on ajersey
—— any jersey. No, professional athletes don’t
walk around their communities in shirts with
their names on the back, but if anyone asks,
just calmly state that it’s halftime or that you’re
delivering season tickets to lucky" fans. ’ A

In addition, this option can be tailored to
the jersey you own. If you have a Curtis Grand-
erson jersey, pull your socks up to your knees. -

Quarterback costumes can be improved with
one of those laminated playbooks that go on
the forearm or a farmy pack ﬁlled with heat
packs.

Instant Costume #6: Gym Shorts

Like I said, athletes don’t walk around in
their jerseys. They do, though, walk around
college campuses in gym shorts and athletic
gear. Have you ever wondered how many Pitt
athletes you walk by every year? I’d venture
it’s about the number of times you spot Gary
McGhee multiplied by about 500.

Change into gym shorts‘, a gray T-shirt and
sneakers. When someone inevitably asks, say
you’re supposed to be a member of the soccer
team. If you add thatyou just ﬁnishedanintense
practice, you don’t even have to shower before
you head out.

Instant Costume #7: Obnoxious Fan

Fans areas much a part of the sports world
as the athletes are. Again, this one isn’t about
what you wear (although body paint seems ﬁt-
ting), but about what clichés you shout.

“Ref does such and such to so and so! Ter-
rible call! Bullpooop! Bullpooop! Where’s the
ﬂag? I love our backup quarterback!”

It’s not exactly inventive, and it might ir-
ritate a few folks, but hey, it’s good enough to
land some candy. I ~

Sunseri making
progress at quarterback

Football 4 15

‘I

Luc Felak I Senior Staff Photographer

Quarterback Tino Sunseri had the ﬁrst 3oo—yard passing game of his career last Satur-

by his doctor to play.

“With Greg Romeus being out, it’s been
a challenge for us defensively,” Wannstedt
said. “Jabaal Sheard continues to make
plays at a high level. He’s been double-
teamed, triple—teamed. He just continues
to make plays and play at that high level.

- Dave Wannstedt:

day against Rutgers.

As his conﬁdence continues to grow,‘

so does the team’s offense-

“For a young quarterback, you couldn’t
really ask for anything more. I think that
everybody just evaluates the quarterback
position by how many passes you com-
plete, and there’s so much more to it,”

For a young quarterback, you couldn’t
really ask for anything more.

His counterpart, Brandon Lindsey, has
stepped up, obviously.”

The Panthers offense is also welcoming
back a much needed player. Lucas Nix has
begun to practice this week. He is expected
to make a full recovery after suffering from
an undisclosed injury and will be on the
ﬁeld Saturday. . _

Also for the offense, quarterback Tino
Sunseri has shown more and more im-
provement as the season progresses.

Pitt will once again rely on the young
quarterback to get them through a big
game. . ’ > ’ '

Wannstedt said.

The Panthers are re—emerging as the
Big East favorite, meaning Saturday’s
matchup will be a difficult ﬁrst road test
for Louisville..

“We are going to see exactly where
we are as a football team and what we
are made of. It is going to be a tremen-
dous environment because we are on the
road,” Strong said. “Any time you are on
the road, you need to pack your defense,
your togetherness and your quickness.
You have to go compete, and we have to
