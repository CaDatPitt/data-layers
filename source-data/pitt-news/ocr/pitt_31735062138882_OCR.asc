ment of Orat'ory at Wooster, and Mr.

DELAWARE, O.——The sophomore.
girls of Monnett Hall had their plans
“nipped” in t‘he bud” when Mrs. New-
berry refused to let them make the
freshmen girls wear green ribbon in
their hair. The house superintender-.t

and did not allow the plans to

»The freshman girls were entirely
cowed by their sophomore friends,

who broke up a meeting which the

‘ under class was holding. There was

a great deal of excitement in the ‘cor-
rid‘ors when the sophomores swooped
down ‘upon the freshmen and at-
tempted to take one of their number
to a place which serves the same pur-

pose as the sulphur spring in the case

Change Faculty .
of llledical School

Several New Professors Join Depart-
ment of _Anatomy.

The only change made in the fac-
ulty of the Medical School this year
was in the Department of Anatomy.
Dr. B. A. Co'hoe,1 who f-or several
years ‘was head oi’ that department, is
no longer connected with the teach-
ing staff of the School. Dr. Cohoe
has for some time been connected
with the St. Francis-Hospital and now
is devoting his entire time to his work
at that institution. Dr. Ralph E:
Sheldon, the professor of Histology,
Emberyology and Nemology of the
Medical School, is now at the head
of the Department of Anatomy. In
his work he is being ably assisted by
Drs. Erastus S. Edgerton, Ellis M.
Frost, Charles H. Aufhammer, Jas.
M. Stanton, Theodore Baker, Holland
H. Donaldson, Daniel A. Jackson and
E. A. Dickey. All these physicians
are well known in Pittsburgh except’
Dr. Edgerton who is formerly of Chi-
cago. Dr. Edgerton assumed his new
duties at the school last week. i He is
a graduate -of the Rush Medical Col-
lege, a department of the University
of Chicago, and a member of the

-to stick together and help “build up

culties which a lack of a community
spirit brings about, the fellows were
asked, to ﬁght harder and get the best
of these difficulties. Also the Presi-
dent expressed a desire to have a large
delegation of Pitt men at Northﬁeld

of the university spirit may be said to
have been in 1453 at the fall of Con-

V stantinople, and since that time this

spirit has had a great inﬂuence on the
progress of the world.

q“At the time of the founding of Pitt
there were not as many people in the
city of Pittsburgh as now attend the
University,,yet the school was estab-
lished. The University was forty years
old before the steam engine came into
use. The mode of transportation was

I . very poor. _So from the very start

Pittsburgh has been greatly inﬂuenced

. by the University spirit.

“To the university spirit and to uni-
versity men we owe the United States
Constitution and all the benefits there-
of. For had it not been for the ac-
tion of clear thinking college men this
document would never have existed.”
, Col. Church expressed a deep ad-
miration for Chancellor McCormick.

.' He said that he could hardly believe

the plans for the great University
would come true, when he ﬁrst heard
of them several years ago. But one

by one the buildings have been com-

pleted or are in the process of con-
structionsaiid not far distant the great
plans will be realized.

The magnitude of the power of the‘

‘city for educational purposes when

the University is ﬁnished will be won-
derful. Col. Church urged the stu-
dents to “get together and work with
the Chancellor and all those who are
at the head of the movement. Then
in a few years the. hill about the Uni-

- lversity, ﬁlled with the various build-

CHOOSE QUESTION FOR ‘
INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE

 

(Continued ‘from Page 1)

satisfactorily when chosen; so that a
great deal of time was wasted and
the question, when ﬁnally worded,
was one—sided.

The question chosen was:

“Resolved, that constitutionali-
ty aside, the principle of the re-
call of judges should be adopted
by the several States.

This questi'on is of recent origin. It
will be rermred that a provision
for the recall of judges was placed in
the Arizona constitution, and that
President Taft refused to sign Ari-
zona’s appeal for admission to_ the
union as a state until the objectionable
clause was removed. President_Taft’s
action has provoked national com-
ment. The general question of the re-
call has become one of pressing im-
portance.
the wording of this question, the de-
baters will not defend or attack the
details of the Arizona plan. They
will consider simply the question of
the recall of judges on its merits, and
not upon the details of its application
to a particular state. This question
thus furnishes an opportunity for the
men of the three institutions to inves-
tigate the issues underlying one of the
liveliest questions_of the present time
and to train themselves in presenting
the two sides ofa well-balanced nation
problem. It is up to date. It is de-
cidedly interesting. It has certam
well-deﬁned issues. It is a question
which will come up again and again
until it is settled. ,

Now that the question is ch0sen,_the
men of the three schools will begin
work on it at once. Both Allegheny
and Wooster are to take it up in their
societies and thresh it ‘out. Here, all
undergradutes are entitled to a try-
out. A preliminary will be held the
last of the fall or the ﬁrst of the
winter term. It is a fair ﬁeld. Every-
body has a chance. And the best men
will be entitled to represent the Uni.-
versity on one of two teams: one here
against Wooster, whom we haveift
yet defeated; 'one'at Allegheny, whom
we defeated last year.

THE “ZOO”.

We have been asked to inform our
readers concerning the purpose of the
little black building that crowns the
crest of the hill just back of the Med-
ical School. People along Fifth Ave-
nue and Forbes Street have been won-
dering what it could be and for the

satisfaction of their inquiries we wish ,

to state that itlis called the “Zoo”.
In reality it is the building in which
Dr. Klotz, of the Department of Path-
ology, keeps his animals for experi-
mental work. These animals are very
cozily housed and in all rival the
Highland Zoo for the number of dif-
ferent species. There are cages of
pigeons, pens of rabbits and, in fact,
most every kind of an animal includ-
ing a sheep. The Zoo is not open to
the public but then visitors are~al-
lowed to peep in at the menagerie

Plan to Revive‘ Interest in Public
Speaking—Honors for Students.

 

' In the hope of reviving interest in
public speaking, Columbia will hold
an ‘oratorical contest on January 19.
in which schoolboys from all -parts or
the State will be eligible to compete
Prizes of $50, $35 and $15 will be
awarded, and the ﬁrst three winners
will also receive medals of gold, silver
and bronze. The schoolboys will be
allowed to select their own subjects,
but must conﬁne their speeches to ten
minutes. ' a
Last year one of the Columbia lit-
erary societies tried the experiment of
holding such a contest, but conﬁned
it to public school students of Greater’
New York. Its success was so marked
that the university decided to run the
contest this year, and to open it -to
public and private schools of the er:—
tire State.. The ﬁnal contest will be
held in Earl Hall. In order to decide
the winners in one evening, there at»
to be a series of elimination trials ii
eight centers of the State-Albany
Binghampton, Buffalo, Newburgh, Pate
chogue, ~ Syracuse, Watertown and
White Plains —— and the succeeg-iv"
speaker at each contest will be al-
lowed to compete in the ﬁnals. The
eight‘ candidates thus chosen will he‘
guests- of the university during their
stay inithis city. Notices are to be
sent to all schools ofthe State, an.l
the preliminary contests must be held
not later than January 1.

 WESLEYAN SOPHS WIN.

 

Freshmen Defeated After an Hour of
Strenuous Fighting.

Delaware,‘ 0. -— After one hour of
fast and furious ‘scrapping the fresh~
men of Ohio .‘Wesleyan University
failed to bring down the colors of the
class of ’14 from the pole.

The two classes were placed the
same distance from the pole, but the
sophs were the first to have their man
up the “bean stock,” not having the
strength of Hercules the pride of the
class of ’14 had to come to the terrz.
ﬁrma ’mid the shouts and jeers of the
freshies. Fast scrapping followed the
descent of the soph, but neither class
was able to put their man up the pole.

‘At m'ost.any point of the rush the
second year men were far superior to
the streaked faced freshies, as they
did not show the least bit of science
or forethought in their attacks. The
signal given ten minutes before the
end brought forth all the strength
that remained, .in the ﬁrst year men
but to no avail, as the sophs were
there with the goods, and did not let
colors in any way be even
touched by the freshies. ‘

When the last shot was ﬁred the
captain of the victors shinned to the
top of the pole and waived the purple
and white triumphantly over the
mass of defeatedfreshies.

FRESHMEN GET HATS

Popular Style and Good Quality Are
Secured by Council in Distinc-

The freshman hat this year will
probably be the Picadilly popular
now, which combines the two desired
qualities ofdistinctiveness and dura-
bility. ’

The Picadilly hat is being worn a
great deal by college students
throughout the land, and its selection
as a freshman hat at Ohio State
should meet with the approval of the
student body. It is proposed to put
the hat up ingray with a scarlet hand.
These colors make a natty appear—
ance and are considered better than
other colors that would have no local
The style which is ap~
proved by the committee and which
will probably be recommended by the
Student Council was submitted by
Connor & Egan of Columbus. The
hat they bid on is a regular two-dollar
hatiwhich they will put up for half
that amount if a sufficient number is
ordered.

Last year was the ﬁrst time that a
departure was made from the conven-
tional little cap which had been‘ worn

to a certain extent since the inaugural?

tion of the custom of distinctive head-

LOCAL CLUBS.

During the last year many student
iorganizations have been started and
 have had great success. There re-

~ Wmains. one ﬁeld for work along this
if'~Tl‘ine. .The men of this University
 come from many states and countries.
iv  is a custom in certain of the large
 t_ T colleges to organize the men from the
1’  ,.‘sa"rne'districts into clubs. In this way
I 2-‘men coming from the same state or
 county learn to know each other,
 when -they might possibly not have

. met each other had not such societies
 been" started. These clubs serve a

‘t igreat purpose in advertising _‘ the
__‘i‘Vschool. They build up a healthy
 school. spirit. They -bring new stu-

"F T ‘dents to; the college.

During the last week a movement
has_been started in this school to or-
ganize these local societies. We be-.
lieve that every man in. the Univer-
 sity should‘ ‘aid; this movement. There
 is. an especial need for such clubs at
g. -the University of Pittsburgh. Owing
 to the many departments in the Uni-

‘ . 5'   d.is1:a.nce .-between them,

 

 
 
  
 

there has until this year been little
intermingling between the men of the
several departments. To bring these
men into closer contact and build up
a University spirit as distinguished
from Department" loyalty would be
the work of these societies. Nothing
would be more efﬁcient in uniting our
men from all departments in an ac-
tive, loyal student body.

THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

The first big game of, the 1911 sea-
son is over. Although the Pitt team‘
was not able to annex the victory,
the boys made a great showing. In

the first real test of the year, they‘

proved themselves worthy of the
wonderful spirit shown by the stu-
dents during the game. Withgthe
score 17 to 0 against us, when the
cheer leader called to the rooters,
“will we win this game?” the reply
was a thund-erous “We will.” Never
before in Pittsburgh has such spirit
been seen. If this continues,» it will
be impossible for Pitt to lose any of
the other games on our hard sched-
ule. We have the team and the stu-
dents will do their share.‘ With such
a combination success should surely
be certain. A

Our .-next game will be with Cor-
nell. It is to be hoped t'hat a large
crowd will accompany the team to
Ithaca. With «a loyal band of Pitt
rooters along to cheer the boys on,
the ‘team will make a great showing.
The trip will be. well worth taking.
In no way can a man become so full
of college‘loya1ty as by joining the
rooters’ squad on its excursion . to
another institution. In addition to
the beneﬁts to be derived from such
an expedition, if it is-.possib1e for a
man to go his duty requires him to
d'o so, for nothing helps a team more
thana large number of loyal .root-
ers-pulling for them all through the
game.

But whether it is possible for every
man to go to'Cornell, no excuse
should be sufficient to prevent any
man from parading over to the rail-
road depot to see the team leave. Let
us give them a royal send-off, one
which they will never forget as long
as they live, one which will go down
in the annals of Pittsburgh as the
greatest ever given any athletic team.
Fellows, we must down Cornell.’ How
are we going to do it? By sending
the Pitt men‘ off with the loudest “A1-
legenee” they have ever heard. So
le-t every man be on hand next Thurs-
day afternoon at three o’clock.

ROOTERS’ MEETINGS.

Nothing this year has aroused so
much enthusiasm as the rooters’
meetings held at noon on the steps.
The attendance has been inéreasing
every day.‘ New songs and new
cheers are being proposed. Several
men have written songs which are
certain to please -the students. These
cheering practices should be contin-
ued ‘every day. And those few men
who have neglected to attend; in the
past should be compelle-d/,to,come and

cheer with all their might. Let the

other departments join the non-pro-
fessionalschools in these mass meet-
ings.‘ These cheering practices bid
fair to surpass the famous prayer
meetings of two years ago. If the
students improve as fast in the next
week as they have in the past, they
will far_ surpass anything of the kind
ever held in the University of Pitts-
burgh.

The gymnasium is “rapidly nearing
completion. The men interested in
basket ball are eagerly awaiting its
opening.

The rooting at the C.arlisle game
was very good, but this does not
mean that there remains no room for
improvement.

The University is rapidly becoming
a cosmopolitan sch'oo1, as the percent-
age of foreigners sent to Pitt from
abroad almost doubled this year.-

The Eastern papers say that Car-
lisle h.as this year the strongest team
ever put on the ﬁeld by the Indians.

THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC

SPEAKING AT PITT‘
Every student in the University who

desires to obtain an insight into the

great value of public speaking to _the;' '

college man, and the _increasing in-
terest in such work -inthe l-eading col-

leges of the United States, should read‘
Rollo L. Lyma.n’s article, “College.

Debating,”

in this month’s Century
magazine. I '

Having read this article,’ let the”
V facts sink in. ' '

In the past “Pitt” has not reached
its highest eﬂiciency in public speak-
ing. for various-reasons (,I say this
without discrediting the work of those
who did their duty by their schoolﬁ.
The past need not inﬂuence the fu-
ture. There is no time like this, the

One Hundred Twenty-ﬁfth Anniver-

sary year, to lay the Corner-stone also
for Pitt’s future in publiospeaking.
Prof. Gibbs has this to say in re-
gard to the student body thisiryear:
“The student body is, in every way, in
numbers, in spirit, in ability, superior

statement is signiﬁcant. With such a

demand that far exceeds the supply
for men trained in this art of all arts,

not-only in the University, but in A

Pittsburgh and everywhere, this year
should be a “blue ribbon” year for the
cause of public speaking.

The ﬁeld of active work this year

c isalso exceptionally large. There will
-be the annual triangular debate (at
least two teams); Notre Dame, West-
minster, Juniata will be met if enough
‘men turn out to secure a sufﬁcient
number of teams: the reguar orator-
ical contest; the “International Peace”
contest; Freshman declamatory con-

test; Sophomore oratorical contest;

Junior extempore contest. These will
furnish work for all who wish to de-
velop themselves and who are keen
for a contest of mind against mind.

Indications so far this year are en-
couraging, indeed, and only a little
honest, consistent work is needed to
bring success. Frank_ Stewart is in
charge ofithe “Pitt Forensic Society”
this year, which means it will be a
“live wire.” A great number of 1915
men have expressed themselves
greatly interested; the
class has some strong men, and we of
the Junior and Senior classes will fur-
nish‘ a great many men who are to
make things go.

Now, -putting away our hammers,‘

forgetting anything we didn’t like in
the department in the past and think-
ing only of the future, let everyone
pull for a banner yearin this depart-
ment of our common work as a school.
. Those who for any reason cannot take
an active part can give their support
to_those inactive work. There is a
chance of a lifetime for Pitt to make a
reputation in public speaking this

DEBATING PLANS BEING MADE

—.___..j

Professor S. S. Swartley, Coach of
Debating, left yesterday for Youngs-

town, O., for“the purpose of meeting,

with Professor Fish of the Universitv
. of Pittsburgh and Professor Lean of
Wooster University, to draw up and
adopt a constituti‘on for the debating
league. Several plans have been sug-

gested by the various members of the

league, but as yet an understanding
has not been reached as to all the de-
tails. It is for this purpose that the
meeting was called. . ’

¢ Another thing to be considered was

the question for the intercollegiate ‘

debates. Wooster has suggested the
‘Old Age Pension. subject and some
phase of the Employer’s Liabilityiact.
Allegheny has offered the Recall of
Judges, the Recall of Municipal Oﬁi-
cials and the. Amherst Idea for Small
Colleges. The executive committee
held a meeting on Tuesday afternoon
and decided to name the ‘Recall of
— Judges as their ﬁrst choice and the
Employer's Liability Act as a second.
The date for the debates will probably

. be March 15, the Univ-ersi_ty of Pitts-
. board of Department of Chemistry.

though some of the newer players
were unable to keep up the “tooting”
and walk across the ﬁeld atthe same
time, nevertheless the music was ac-
ceptable and everyone was inuch
pleased-with it. The band added a
great deal to the enthusiasm of Sat-

NEW CLUB FORMS.

 

The students of the University who
are alumni of Wilkinsburg High School
are organizing a club whose object is
to bring students to the University of
Pittsburgh, and thereby assist in the
building up of the university. The
ﬁeld in which they will work will not
be limited, but the center of the effort
willwbe in their ‘own High School. It
is planned to keep the High School
students in touch with University do
ings from time to time, thereby tend
ing to bring them into the home in-
stitution.

Coeds Entertained.

Mrs. Scribner, wife of Prof. H. S.
Scribner, entertained the young ladies
of the University last Wednesday at
their home on Murray Hill avenue.
Tea was served and all had a very
delightful time. "I

Librarians’ Convention.

Miss Elston, the University‘ Li-
brarian, attended the State Librarians’
convention last Saturday and Sunday
at Saegertown, Penna.

 

The Owl Board is showing an in-
itiative -in organizing early which
promises well for its success this year.

 

The Senate is rapidly becoming pr-
ganized. May it be much stronger
this year than last. '

FOOTBALL DOPE

David J. Davies, expert sporting’

writer of the Pittsburgh ’Dispatch.
evidently thinks highly of Pitt spirit,
as he said in describing the game:

“It must not be thought, however,
that the Pitt rooters laid down. Nix!
No! Not!!! They kept yelling and
pulling, pulling and yelling until the
referee’s whistle had blown on the last
quarter —— until the game was over.
When the score stood 17-0 for the
Indians, the cheer leader asked:

“ ‘Will we ,win this game, fellows’
and the concerted reply was:

‘,‘"We will?’

“Then, ‘Will we whip W. & _l.?’

“ ‘We will!’

" ‘Will we smother State?’

“ ‘We will!’

Students Stick _ to Finish.

“No, sir! The Pitt rooters didn't
quit. Nor did the band. This organ-
ization, under the guidance of Don
Kirk, kept tooting and blowing while
there was time to toot and blow. No
sign of a laydown. If good, old-fash-
ioned rooting would have score]
touchdowns, Pitt would have won by
a million—to-nothing tally.”

Charlie Quailey was hurt duringvth:
Indian game, but will be in ﬁne shape
for the Cornell game on Saturday.

Don’t miss that parade on Thurs-
day, fellows! It will help us beat Cor-—
nell.

The Indians outplayed us Saturday
but they had all the breaks in luck.
One of the officials said after the
game that 6-0 would have showed the
relative strength of the teams much
better than 17-0.

Many of the students absent mind-
edly reach for a timepiece, but sud-
denly remember it isn't there. Oh,
you Indians! ‘
