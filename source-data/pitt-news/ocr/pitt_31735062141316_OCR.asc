Donald C. Bradford, head
seismologist of the depart-
ment of physics, pointed to
three .holes in the sub-basement
::t’loo'r of the Cathedral and said,
“This will be the site of our new
seismograph, the second‘of its type
in the world.”

The new’ seismograph, earth-
quake recorder, will not replace

the one currently in use, but will
act as a supplement to it, Brad-

ford explained.

The primary difference be-
tween the two machines is that
1 instruments on the apparatus
now in operation are located in
three different rooms, while dials
" of the new mechanism will not
necessitate the 3-room relay.

' iThe instruments located in the
ﬁrst two rooms pick up and relay
the waves set up by a tremor to
the third room, much like a photo-
grapher’s dark-room, where the
s’quakc is recorded on a light-sen-

isitive paper by means of aglight

beam. .

h At’ present these papers may
only be changed every 24 hours.
If an earthquake occurs a few

‘minutes after the paper is placed

 on the drum the staff has no know-

..,,

ledge of it until the paper is re-
moved and developed the next day.

The new seismograph, which

ber will operate on a mechanical
principle.

\ By means of a highly sensitive
‘pendulum arrangement, which will
operate a stylus on a smoked-
paper, tremors will be indicated
“on the spot” the moment they
occur. ‘Again the waves brought
about by the earthquake will af-
fect the pendulum to move the sty-
lus, showing immediately even the
slightest tremor on any part of the
earth. In addition, a well-gauge,
indicating a tremor by the raising
or lowering of a water level, will
be used.

V Mr. Bradford explained that
“the new instruments will be
used primarily for student re-
search, and, due to their simpli-

Men ’.s Fra ternity R ushing

Pitt fraternity men will have
more time this year to prepare
their speeches on the advantages
and opportunities of fraternity
life, especially designed for future
freshman pledges.

Rushing has been postponed

for one weelc.

Announcement of rushing post-
ponement was made public today
by M. Wendell. Deitz, C48, pub-
licity director of fraternity rush-
ing activities.

Postponement of rushing from
October 7 to October 14 was de
cided during a meeting of Inter
fraternity council Tuesday be-
cause it was [feared that many
fraternity members would be _ab-

sent the last and most importanti

days of rushing week due ‘to the
Michigan ‘game. .

Richard Mansﬁeld, E42, presi-
dent of IF council, explained that
many members of fraternities be-
longed to‘ the band, numbering
about 200 students, others were
on the football squad, and addi-"'
tional fraternity men not con-

nected with football planned to
attend the grid opener.

Nearly all those who attend

,, the game will leave Friday aft-
ernoon, missing the ﬁnal events
of rushing as originally sched-

uled.
The entire fraternity week and
rushing program will be published
next week, Mr. Umble assured.

  ” Reveals 1941 Record Yea

I

Setting a. record which can nev-
er be beaten in the years to come,
the placement bureau for men has

announced that virtually 100 per
cent of placeable men in the class
or 1941 have received positions.

Edward B. Williams, director of
the placement bureau for men,

has reported that 320 men of last, .
* year’s

gr duating -class rwere
placed in ull—time positions dur-
ing the record year for the free

‘ employment service.

 
    

, A scarcity of men for avail-
able jobs has been noted in sev-
eral industries, especially those
in the technical ﬁelds, Mr. Wil-
liams commented in his release
of ‘the facts and figures of his
bureau’s work during the past
year.

One reason for the increased
opportunities for graduates, in ad-
'dition to the expansion of indus-
try, has been the increasing call of
graduates into the armed forces,
either~through operation of the

-selective’ service act or the call of
ROTC—trained reserve officers in-
to active service.

Fraternity Men Go Native,

Citizen Kane

Run-ning around the neighbor-
hood “au naturel” is the latest
charge against local fraternity
men.

According to residents of North
Neville street, objecting to an at-
tempt to change the classiﬁcation

of property at North Neville and

Center avenues, “nude boys run-
ning around the neighborhood is
a typical example of a fraternity
house.”

They feel that college frater-
nity houses, which can be estab-
lished in that district under the
new classification, are a detri-
ment to any residential communi-
ty. -

“We don’t want our children
mixed in with that type.” Thomas
Kane, of 416 North|Neville street,
stated.

University men, however, feel
differently. '

Interrupting their discussion of
rush week’ plans to grant an inter-
view Wednesday afternoon, Roy
H. Umble, assistant to the dean of
men and adviser to men’s frater-
nities, and Richard Mansﬁeld, E42,
Phi Gamma Delta, Interfraternity
president, expressed the opinion
that there was little basis for the
story,

Said Mansfield:

“It's quite

probable that this is just’a trump- _

ed-up story to keep fraternity
men out of the neighborhood.”

Umble conceded that “it may
have happened, but that doesn’t

indicate that it’s typical of frater-
nity men’s act.-ions.”

“You’ll‘ notice,” he continued,
“that they don’t say whether this
happened in 1941 or 1900; or
whether or not the fellows were
put in an insane asylum after this
happened.”

Asked whether such actions
could have occurred as the result
of “hell-week,” the two agreed
that there was a slight possibility
that this was the ca-se, but that this
accusation was more probably a
follow-up of an earlier attempt to
keep fraternities out of the dis-
trict.

Young Poets’  
  Contains Good Material 

by ANGELO BRUNo= A

Malcolm Cowley in a recent
critical essay in the "Saturday Re-
view of,Literatu1.'e” predicted a
growth of interestin modern poet-
ry during the next two years.
Cowley explained that in time of
war poetry becomes an outlet for
emotional strain and hysteria.

In view of this it is interesting
to exa.mine “From This Hill,” an
anthology containing the work, of
seven young poets who studied
this summer at the Cummington
school, Cummington, Mass.

The poets, who range in age
from twenty to twenty-seven, are
not as yet established in the
world of letters. They are all
very young and very enthusias-
tic, and each one of them has a
deﬁnite personality which is re-
flected in his poems.

All of them, however, have had
similar literary influences, pri-
marily Eliot and Auden, and write
in the idiom of modern poetry.
Among these seven poets there are
probably two or three who may
exert quite an influence in the fu-
ture.

The _ﬁrst poet represented is
Jane Gray ‘Ward. Miss Ward has a

definite flair for language, and"

she writes in a highly specialized
vocabulary which has been influ-
enced too strongly by Auden,

When she says for example,
Peace and satz'sfa—ct2'ou dwell in
the edges, A

Cuttiugi paper dolls from the
winter's morning,

one understands what she ~is try-
ing to say only if he is familiar-
with the poetry of Auden. Despite

Speedy Aid to Russia

  Not Vital to

‘ by HORACE UMBERGER

United States, alias ‘arsenal of
'democratic and otherwise nations,
mostly the latter, resisting aggres-
sion, should give as little help to
Russia as is necessary to keep the
country from being defeated.

This country should know by
now that Russia is no more to be
trusted than is Germany. 1 For
Stalin has proved himself to be
just as ruthless a dog as Hitler.

President Roosevelt, no more
than anyone else, knows just how
3far Stalin can be trusted to ﬁght
“our battles.” At any time, the
newspapers may blare out that

 resistance, to the Germany

heber alles theory was all a mis-
take. If this happened when U.S.
had invested considerable arsenal
stock in Russia, Inc., well. . . .
Advantage ,

And then, our government
"should consider that it might not
be ‘to our advantage to have Rus-
sia win this war. For only last
spring, predictions were that the
Russian vulture would play oﬂ’
England and U.S. against Ger-
inony, and vice versa, until u vir-
Qual stalemate existed.

Then the Soviets could conquer
ivory country in the war and
spread the hammer and sickle, not
 four freedoms, to all corners
of the earth.

Hans Change

' Since that time, of course, plans
ﬂove slightly changed. With the
ﬂropping of old, a few new ideas
game into the theory. The new
pourse will be to conquer Germany
gwith aid. from U.S. and Britain.

CALLS

ALTHOUGH it looks something like a sunrise
over Pike’s Peak, this is really a chart showing
the ebb and flow of Long Distance calls during
an average day.

Notice the sharp peaks in mid-morning, mid-
afternoon and at 7 P. M.? That’s when Long
Distance lines are most crowded these busy days.
Defense activities have put an extra heavy load
on telephone facilities.

If you avoid these three peak periods, you’ll
get faster service on your calls--and you’ll be
helping to “speed the calls that speed defense.”

Sweaters get longer andlouder.

Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of

the Student Health service, as-
sured the University today that
comparatively few Pitt students
have enrolled from the paralysis
stricken areas of the state,~and
they are being examined regular-
ly. - —
Alarmed at the outbreak of
infantile paralysis in central, and
eastern Pennsylvania, health of-
ﬁ‘c_ials of the Pittsburgh colleges
have subjected all students liv-
ing in the stricken area to im-
mediate medical checkups.
Students coming from the epi-
demic district have been carefully
examined before registration and
are observed twice a week for
signs of the disease, Dr. Carlson
said. '
"There is no need for alarm
here at _the University, for we
have been very cognizant of the
situation,” Dr. Carlson declared.

Elusive Halfback

Football Roster
Shows 6 Sophs
From Pittsburgh

Pittsburghers will have more
than mere perfunctory civic pride
in the Panthers during the next
few seasons if six members of
Charley Bowser‘s current crop of
sophomores have.-anything to do
about it. The sextet composed of
Bob Costello, Tom Economos, Jack
Kerr, Joe Broudy, Joe Salvucci.
and Leo Mueller are strictly local
high school products. Costello,
Economos, and Kerr hail from
Schenley. Broudy and Salvucci
are from Peabody, and Leo Muel-
ler comes from Perry High School.

Kerr and Salvucci, both of
whom were fullbacks in high
school will probably see action as
ﬁrst year men on the varsity. Sal-
vucci has been shifted to tackle
and will help fill the gap left by
Ted Konetsky.

Kerr gracluatcd from Schenley
in 19318 and has a season with one
of Pittsbu1'gh’s outstanding sand-
lot gird teams in the Pittsburgh
Lyceum outﬁt to his credit. His
playing, topped off by his fine per-
formance on Saturday indicates
that he may be a hard man to keep
off the first team.

Broudy and Costello, who op-
posed each other in high school
competition, and Leo Mueller are
tackles who give indications that
they are going to hand the veteran
tackles a hard run for their men-
ey when the battle for the tackle
berths begins.

 Woman Reporter Prescribes Aspirins,
Sleeping Powders For Coach Bo Wser

BY Elaine KAHN

We don’t know what the Panth-
ers ever did to the schedule mak-
ers, but judging from the nine
horrible fates that represent this
season's football schedule it must
have been something pretty ter-
rible.

i The schedule comprised of Pur-

ilue, Michigan, Minnesota, Duke, 
Ohio State, Fordham, Nebraska, '

Penn State, and Carnegie Tech
reads like “Who's Who” in col-
legiate football. In fact. only Stan-
ford, Joe Louis, and a Stuka
Bomber -are lacking to make its
‘lethal qualities complete.

We Still Play Tech

As it stands, the schedule is
one that would cause the coach
of a team that combined the best
features of Rockne’: Four Horse-
men. Sutherland’: “Dream Back-
ficld,” and George Halos’ T for-
mation to stay awake nights.
What Charles Bowser with his
deemphasized footballers intends
to use in place of sleep is a ques-
tion we'd just as soon pan over.
Already three aspirin companies
are reported trying to subsidize

~Mr. Bowser.

Be that as it may, it_ is a fact

/

that the mere mention of the 1941

Panther schedule to some people
causes the outlook to become so
dark that, forgetting themselves,
they begin to think there’s been
an eclipse and dash in Search of

smoked mirrors and binoculars.

Of the nine games to be played
Pitt is conceded a “sure” chance
of defeating only one, Carnegie
Tech, in the ﬁnal game of the sea-
son. As for the others, well . . .
Minnesota won the Big Ten Cham-
pionship last year, and Michigan
was second. Nebraska was the
Rose Bowl selection and the Ford-
ham, team that smothered the
Panthers 24 to 12 last season is
merely being picked by the ex-
perts to be the “team of the year."

Don't Forget Tech

Thoughts of what is liable to
happen to the Panthers in these
content: is not recommended for
persons either with good imagina-
tions or poor constitutions.

What, you ask, about the
Panthers themselves, the boys who
are expected to sacriﬁce them-
selves to this “suicide” schedule.
Well, fifty-eight players turned
out for scrimmage. So maybe the
boys are going to take refuge in
the theory that there is safety in
numbers. It's a. cinch they'd better
do something, for as a schedule,
well, it’: plain premeditated mur-
der. * ‘

  

Over Pitt Pa

The 1941 Pitt Panthers will
make their stadium debut just
one week from today in the
home opener against a for-
midable Purdue Boilermaker
eleven.

Coach Bowser’s boys will
go into the game as underdogs
for the second consecutive
year, but they will be deter-
mined to keep their string of home
inaugurals intact.

The Panthers will be giving all,
for they have nothing to lose, but

lots to gain should they overcome
their powerful rival.

Purdue will come to town shovvi
ing 20 major lettermen. 12 minor
lettermen, and a half dozen pro-
mi-sing sophomores. Mal Edwards.
coach of the Purdue gridders, is
rather optimistic concerning his
team's chances for the oncoming
season for All-American end, Dave
Rankin, and center Ted Axton are
the only varsity men lost through
graduation.

Hard Luck Team
The Boilermakers record of
last year was not at all impres-
sive for theywon only two games
and lost 6. The Associated Press
labelled Purdue “the hard luck
team of the nation" when a
grand total of 7 points and 38
seconds, not to mention an in-
eligible player, represented the
margin of defeat in the Ohio
State, Wisconsin, and lndiana
games.

Tomorrow afternoon the Boil-
ermakers will get their first test,
playing the Vanderbilt Commo-
dores at Lafayette, Indiana. The
outcome of this early season tilt
should throw a great deal of light
on whether the Purdue team has
as much strength as the publicity
reports credit them.

One of the standout perform-
ers from last year’: varsity team
is a local boy, John Petty. Pet-
ty, six foot, one inch, 210 pound
fullback, is expected to carry all
the burden of the plunging post
this fall.

Massillon Graduate
Co-captains Tom Melton and
Jimmy Miller, senior guards, were
frequently mentioned for all-team
honors last fall, and are expected
to come into their own in their
ﬁnal year of college competition.

Miller graduated from Massillon
high school in Ohio which should
be enough credit for any football
player. Both he and Melton are
rather short and light for guards,
but seem to make up for their
weight by being the two fastest
men on the squad.

The Purdue team under Mal Ed-
wards, former Notre Dame star,
uses the Rockne system extensive-
ly, which should develop into a

‘For the second consecutive year,
 Phi Gamma Delta fraternity was
rcrowned champion of the Intra-
 mural League. The annual award
T was made last Wednesday night
 at the Druid smoker in the ban-
""“quet,room of the Soldiers and
‘ Sailors Memorial. Mr. James

Potts, director of intramural ath-

letics, presented the cup to Jack

Bitner, E42, president of the Phi
_ Gains.

 ‘The Fijis started the season off
right last fall by copping the fra-
ternity league football crown, but
had to be satisfied with the run-
ners-up notch in the playoffs with
the Punks for the intramural

, league championship.

.Brains Over Braun

‘ . Mike Mitchell and Paul McNeil
were the outstanding players on
the'Wallingford street squad, and
were flanked by such dependable

"‘men as Kenny Grossett, Al Hol-

«-broﬁk, John Bitner, Chuck Egan

.,aiid Jim Warne. Though not a

fheavy team, they more than held
their own against -stronger and
heavier opposition.

6., ln basketball, the Fijis had a
_better year than they expected,
when they nosed out the Phi
Kaps, defending champs last
year, for second place in the fra-
ternity league. Bob Thurbon, var-
sity football star, set the pace for
his mates as he rolled up point
after point with amazing long
shots. Bruce Reuter, Earl Pressel,
Al Holbroolr and Bob Quick were
the olther members of the first
team who helped Thurbon make
r‘-wash a good showing for their
house.

At Long Last
After being forced to accept the
runners-up notch twice, the Phi
Gains ﬁnally crashed through to
take the volleyball championship
for the fourth year in a row. Al-
though they lost their ﬁrst game
in four years in this sport, they
‘had an easy time of it, walking‘
away with the title.

Although a number of last sea-
son’s veteran runners have depart-
*ed, ‘the University of Pittsburgh
cross country squad expects again
to be among the leaders in the
East. Heaviest loss to the Panthers
“came when fleet-footed Walt Ster-
ner departed via the graduation
route.

The Pitt track candidates have
been performing for the past two
weeks over the Schenley park
course and indications are that
last season's record will be sub-
stantially upheld. To tide the Blue
and Gold team over the schedule

promising newcomers. Returning
from last year are Captain John-
“ ny Brosky, Marcus Allias, Bob
Graham, and Bob Davis while Bill
, Curtis and Bob Armstrong are the
“rookies.
Sterver Lost

Included on the list of Panther
opponents are. Michigan State,

‘ Penn State, Army, Carnegie Tech,
and New York University. The
latter has been added to the Pitt
schedule only in a. tentative man-
ner.

Following the meet with Slip-
pery Rock, the Panthers will head
for New York to compete in the

_ IC4A meet. Last season the only
Panther to ﬁnish among the ﬁrst
twenty-ﬁve was Walt Sterner who
ﬁnished sixth.

Loss Not Mourned

A Bob Davis, junioi-— harrier, also
competed in the IC4A meet at
'Van Cortland‘ Park, New York,
\and surprised the coaching staff

themselves

by placing very high for a sopho-
smore. Davis has not practiced
5with the squad at all this fall, and
is not in the best of shape, conse-
quently will have to round out

as champions in one sport, the Fi-
jis kept right on rolling and cop-
ped both the intramural swimming
meet and the I-F track meet. Es-
pecially in the track meet did they
show their superiority to all the
other teams, for they placed ﬁrst
in every event but one, and took
second in that one. It was also dur-
ing the track meet that Bobby
Thurbon established himself as
one of the best all around athletes
to come to Pitt in a long time. He
captured the 100-yard dash; the
hop, step, and jump; and the
broad jump, besides giving his
mates a good lead in the 440—yard
relay, as he led off. At the end of

Schedule

Pittsburgh list of opponents will
be two of the strongest teams in
the country-—Army and Purdue.
The loss of these will not be
mourned, however, since both
handed the Pitt harriers convinc-
ing defeats in the 1940 campaign.
Coach Olson is expected to bank
heavily upon the vastly improved
Johnny Brosky and Marcus Allias
to bear the brunt of the burden.
Each has turned in ﬁne perform-
ances in the past and each is ex-
pected to hit his stride this year.

Brosky was named captain of
the cross-country team last spring,
and will be running his last year
for the University. Allias, Davis,
and Graham are all juniors, and
have another year of varsity com-
petition left.

Graham is a question mark on
the team this fall, for only at
times does he show any brilliancy
to merit attention. Should Gra-
ham develop into a winner, Coach
Carl Olson's boys will be hard to
stop. ‘

Would You Care to Run?

Candidates for the squad should
report to assistant coach James
Potts, Monday afternoon at 3:30
at the stadium. Everyone, regard-
less of past experience, is asked
to try out for the large number of
vacancies now existing on the
squad. Coach Carl Olson says that
everyone will be kept on the
squad, regardless of having had
high school experience or not.

The team is taken to the Schen-
ley oval later in the afternoon
where they may show their wares
along the hills in the park.

Sportsmanship Always

The Fijis wound up a very suc-
cessful year by placing second in
the fraternity softball league.
Thus they were able to boast of
the very ﬁne record of not ﬁnish-
ing lower than second in six intra-
mural events. They showed that
they were versatile as well as able.
But above all they showed the
thing that is stressed most by ath-
letic officials and instructors—-
sportsmanship.

Document of Hungarian Patriot

A document of freedom is to
be presented to the University.
The document is a letter written
by Louis Kossuth, great Hungar-
ian patriot, on September 27, in
the year 1851. It was the most
cherished possession of the late
George Zimmermann, former presi-
dent of the Hungarian room com-
mittee, and was acquired in Hun-
gary just before the outbreak of

_the present war by Mr. Zimmer-

man. Since at his death he asked
that it be given to the University,
it will be presented by Dr. Samuel
Gomery, now president of the
Hungarian room committee, in
special ceremonies early next year.

Having been written 90 years
ago tomorrow, this letter has a
queer parallel in today's world
events. ,

Hungarian Leader

Kossuth was the leader of the
Independence party of Hungary,
which stood for separation from
Austria. He fought for years for
the freedom of Hungary by fos-
tering Magyarism, in an attempt
to make an independent national-
istic state out of that part of Aus-
tria-Hungary in which the Mag-
yars were the dominant race.

A liberal, K0-ssuth struggled for
the abolition. of feudal burdens on
the peasants and for the taxation
of the nobles.

Over 100 years ago he struggled
for a freedom for little Hungary
that now almost all of Europe has
seen snatched from its grasp.

Educated in Paris and London,
Louis Kossuth made 19 trips to
the United States to bring his
cause personally before the peo-
ple of America. It will be on the
nation-wide anniversary of his
nineteenth trip here that the let-
ter will be presented to the Hun-
garian room of the University.

It was after his last ﬁght for
the freedom of Hungary that he
fled to Turkey. There he was
promptly arrested out of defer-

nce‘to Austria.

Norwegians
To Donate‘
Classroom

_ Construction on the Norwegian
room, next in the series of the
University's nationality rooms, has
been started, -Albert A. Klimchek,
University architect, revealed
Wednesday. The room will be lo-
cated on the ﬁrst ﬂo.or next to
the Russian room, facing the
Belleﬁeld entrance of the Cathed-
ral. '

The room, which is to be di-
vided into two parts, ‘will have a
larger part for the students and a
smaller portion for the professor.
Combined, the two parts would
make up a_ room about ‘the size of
the Scotch room. The sections will
be separated by a squared-head
arch.

In” the larger portion of the
room will be a corner fireplace
and b e n c h e s along the wall.
The ceiling will slope and have
four chandeliers suspended from
it. Wallsland ceiling will be of
slightly stained spruce wood while
oak will be used for the floor.. The
recess of a large bay window to
brighten the room, will be plaster-
ed and have a stone floor. The
walls will be lined with vertical
boards, set off by molded edges.

The smaller part of the room,
in which the walls, ceiling and
floor will again be of wood, will
be decorated with floral designs.

Type of architecture used in the
room is classed as domestic.

When the room will be open
cannot be predicted, explains Mr.
Klimchek, because shipment of the
necessary material is .-delayed by
the war-. ‘

But his many trips to America
had borne fruit and, as part of a
great storm of indignation in the
United States at his arrest, Con-
gress voted to send the US Battle-
ship “Miss'is-sippi” to rescue him
from his Turkish prison.

Interest for him and his cause
was so widespread and so sincere
that new communities were named
after him; a village in Clarion
county, one in Pennsylvania, and
a county in Iowa among. them.

The Letter

The government of Turkey im-
mediately allowed its prisoner to
depart "won the arrival of the US
battleship. It was on this battle-
ship in the harbor of Marseilles,
France, that the letter. that the
University is to receive was writ-
ten.

Kossuth’s letter reveals the-
same attempt at government by
remote control such as is employ-
ed by the exiled heads of govern-

Players’ Drama
Tryouts Continue

Tryouts for the Pitt Players
production, “Yellow Jacket,” by
George C. Hazelton and Benrimo,
will continue today at 2:30‘o’clock
in 232 Cathedral.

A.ll eligible students may try out‘
for parts, and need not be regis-
tered members of Pitt Players, an-
nounces Buell W. Whitehill, di-
rector and assistant professor of
English.

“Yellow Jacket” has been de-
scribed asa Chinese fantasy, and
will be presented by the Players as
their experimental drama of the
year.

West,” by Elmer Rice, of the
Playwrights’ company of New
York City.

ments staying in London today. It
outlines another trip to England
and the United States, in person,
to win further sympathy and sup-
port for Hungarian independence.

His country, one sees by‘ the
letter, had much in common with
the dominated ones of today. Like
them, the Hungary of 1851 had to
hide its time. He writes:

“When the day arrives on
which we shall break the yoke of
tyrants forever, the nation shall
not be afraid that ambitious trai-
tors will be able to frustrate our
heroic struggles.”

He also makes a strong plea for
national unity. Then he states his
own case as an exiled ruler. He
writes:

“I was prevented temporarily by
force from the execution of my
gubernatorial powers, but the le-
gality of the source from which

this office ha-s its origin cannot be

weakened.
“I will continue to exercise the
rights.'of my office until I am
deﬁnitely’ convinced that the na-
tion is in a position to determine
her own future.”
As he struggled, so they

gle now. V '
