Wherrett Lab Dedicated

Memorial Fund
Creates Nuclear

Research Center

A grant from the Wherrett
Memorial Fund of the Pitts-
burgh Foundation has en-
abled the University to open
the Wherrett. Laboratory of
Nuclear Chemistry.

When the laboratory was open-
ed‘ last . Wednesday, chemistry
majors began working with radio-
active materials, ‘Geiger counters

and scintillation spectrometers,
machines for counting gamma
rays.

According to Dr. Robert» Wolke,
associate professor of chemistry,
“These first experiments are kid
stuff.’ Later experiments, such as
the separation of fission products
and taking ‘gamma, ray spectras,
will be- more challenging.”

Dr. Wolke explained that the
experiments have been design-
ed to keep the radioactivity
level at a minimum. As an ex-.
.tra . protective measure, though,
each student wears a snap—on
pen-like ionization chamber that
indicates the radiation level.

The laboratory, which isnamed
after the late Harry S. Wherrett,
civic leader and chairman of the
board of the Pittsburgh Plate
Glass Company, consists of two

-- -~ rooms.

One contains six Geiger count-
ers and a scintillation spectro-
meter; the other an isolated area
for working with radioactive ma-
terials. An additional research
laboratory will be opened. in the
next three months.

In addition to the grant, by the
Wherrett Memorial Fund, the Na-
tional Science Foundation parti-
cipated in the financing.‘ The
Atomic. -Energy Commission has
awarded funds for teaching and
research.

 

Book Reviews ‘
Begin Wednesday;
‘Actors’ Featured

Dr. Abe Laufe, associate profes-
sor of English, will open the Book
Center’s 1962 series of reviews
when he speaks on “Actors Talk
About Acting: Fourteen In-
terviews With Stars of the‘ The-
atre,” by Lewis Funke and John
E. Booth, Wednesday, at 4:15 p.m.
in the Fine Books Room.

Based on taped interviews with
today's most distinguished actors
and actresses, the new anthology
presents varied opinions of mod-
ern theatre. Some of the commen-
tators are Helen Hays and Jose
Ferrer.

Having written several 0ne—act

“plays, Laufe has an active interest

in the theatre. He is also presently
editing a new collection of letters
entitled “An Army Doctor‘s Wife
on the Frontier,” which will be
released by the University Press

in, the spring.

Theater Eleven
To Cast Plays

Tryouts for a double bill of one
act plays entitled ‘irwo Out of
Four" will be held tomorrow at 7
p.m.~and Wednesday at 2 p.m. The
program will be held February 27
and 28, by the Theatre 11 program
of the University Theatre.

Bill Kingsley and Larry Heller,
graduate students in the Depart-
ment of Speech and Theatre Arts,
will direct the plays. The directors
have requested that those plan-
ning to read arrive promptly for
the casting because of the unusual
nature of the casting procedure.

The title “Two Out of Four”
pertains to the uncertainty of the
directors so far as to which plays
they will use.

Heller will be casting for
“Purgatory” by William Butler
Yeats or “Bedtime Story” by

Sean O’Casey. Kingsley will use
“Nine Sons in a Row” by Joel
Oliansky or “It Should Happen
to a Dog" by Wolf Mankiowitz.

Singer-Guitarist To Perform
At Stephen Foster Memorial

By MATTHEW NESVISKY _
The University PM Series will present folk singer-

ning, at 8:30 p.m.

4 guitarist Odetta in Stephen Foster Memorial Thursday. eve-

Members of the University community, must obtain
tickets in advance for the singer’s single performance. The
tickets are available now, free of charge, at the SU‘= desk,

the Information Counter. CL. andé

at the Health Professions desk.
Odetta, who has been hailed as
“the most glorious new voice in

.American folk music,” is noted for

her recent concert tours, record
albums and television appear-
ances. Her singing voice has been
described variously as baritone,

. basso or contralto, “depending on
’what vocal forces she choose to

unleash at the time.”

Born Odetta Holmes on the
last day of 1930, in Birmingham,
Alabama, the entertainer soon
moved to Los Angeles. After
graduation from high school in
1947, she began working as a
domestic by day and studying

music at Los Angeles City Col- ..

lege in the evening.

She had always planned a ca-
reer in classical music, but slowly
she became interested in folk
singing. After teaching herself to
play the guitar, Odetta became a
part of the fast-growing group of
folk music enthusiasts.

Her first major public ap-
pearance was at the Tin Angel,
in San Francisco, where she
performed for an entire year.
Then, with an admirable reper-
toire of American and English
folk songs, she went to New
York where: “she worked with
Harry Belafonte and Pete See-
ger.

Since -then she-has appeared on
a. television «special with Bela-
fonte, for which she won the Syl-
Vania Award, secured several mo-
tion picture roles, made ﬁve record
albums and has sung in concert,
including a performance at Car-
negie Music Hall.

Fraternity Rushing Decreases

By Watt Swetonic

Winter fraternity rushing has
thus far failed to match Interfra-
ternity Council’s expected regis-
tration.

Up until last Wednesday, a total
of 57 men had registered for rush
as compared with 192 who regis-
tered last year, according to Lou
Fox. general rush chairman.

“Right now we are somewhat
behind our expected registration,
but I feel that during the remain-
ing week of rush many more men
will register.” stated Fox.

‘Sell System’

At the regular IF meeting held
Wednesday night in 306 SH, Fox
called upon members to support
rush, and to “Please do me a fa-
vor. Get out and sell yourself and
the fraternity system."

Commenting, at the same
meeting, on the small number
of men registered, Art Pape,
president of IF, stated that it
“is not the fault of publicity, for
Mike Bebke (publicity chair-
man) has done a fine job.

“Out of the 47 men who regis-
tered at the smoker, 33 of them
lived in the dorms,” continued
Pape, “and we must therefore al-
so impress the commuiters with
the fraternity system.

‘Not so Bad’
~“We have something to offer
a man scholarship-wise, and we
need to impress this on the stu-
dents."

In defense of the rushing sta-
tistics, Pape called to the atten-
tion of the council the fact that

“last year 450 men registered
during both rushes and this year
425 signed up. When compared
with the 300 drop in expected
freshman enrollment, we are

not as bad oﬁ as would seem.”

Speaking on the same theme,
Slotkin, vice-president of IF, re-
marked that “it’s time we started
getting up and going after pros-
pective rushees.

Seek Intelligence

“In the future,” Slotkin advised,
“just don't rush for the sharp
guy, go after the smart fellow also.
The fellow with a 3.6 or a 3.8 may
not be the best dresser or the best
looking, but he has shown that he
has something on the ball and
will probably make a g o o d
brother.” , '

Poetry As ‘Utterance’  

is per mo...

     
   

Midday Speaker
Addresses 500

By BARRY GROSS

In a southern drawl, poet-

novelist Robert Penn Warren
called poetry an utterance
that comes from inside — “a
great big ‘ouch’.”
_ Speaking at the ﬁrst Mid-
day program of the winter tri-
mester last Wednesday, Warren
discussed poetry as utterance, ob-
ject, and communication.

Poetry as an utterance “is more
of a greatbig ouch than a crow
of triumph,” he declared. “It
arises from a need‘ to know what
makes you want to say ouch. "It
is a way to knowledge and.self-
understanding.”

‘Reflects Reality’

“As an object, poetry is cut off
from the person who made the
utterance,” Warren continued. “It

is a shape which has absorbed
everything that has made the ut-

terance necessary.”

Using the analogy of Perseus
and the Gorgon, he referred to
poetry as “the reflection of
reality which we can bear to
look at.”

Finally, the pulitzer prize win-
ner called poetry ‘communication-’
“The ﬂavor and the image of
poetry are communicated more

‘ than the idea,” he said, “involv-

ing some totality of your being.
The big ouch carries us back to
the author in order to understand
the process of human experience.”
Edited Review
Close to 500 people jammed the

' SU Ballroom and Supper Room to

hear the famed author speak. He
began by referring to the “South-
ern Review” which he once edit-
ed. “‘We felt safe with Huey
Long,” Warren explained. “Else-
where, deans might read a maga-
zine. Huey knew an idea never
had an effect upon the electorate.”

Following his “hip-shot, home
made theorizing” on poetry, War-
ren read selections from his po-
etry. Later, at the Coffee Hour, he
discussed his various novels and
poetry.

Costs (30  Up, Up...

By Tam Bryon!

Pittsburgh’ newspapers have recently published
two stories that have been repeated time after
time in the -past ﬁve years. First was the headline
story “Pitt Raises Tuition,” followed by “\Tr011e)'.,
Bus Service Slashed.” The two articles and the
conflict behind
them, while not directly related, 
reflect a ‘common problem or
shared by the Pittsburgh Rail-
ways Company and the Univer-
sity. .. ‘

The trolley company ha
been plagued ‘by costly s.trikes,.
rising labor costs, an urgen
need ‘for equipment. moderniza
tion, and sharply decreasing
numbers of passengers. To com

  
   
 
 
 
 
 
  

- bat these problems, the company .

has sought iadditional revenue, obtained through
increased trolley and bus fares. Instead ofbringing
better service, fare’ increases have discouraged
many riders from using the trolleys. and resulting
Vpessenger losses have forced service curtailments.
Instead of relieving a ﬁnancial crisis, higher fares
have indirectly creatednew money problems as in-
dicated by the dismissal of 52 trolley and bus
operators; .

While transit ‘committees and the Port Author-
ity study the problems of Pittsburgh mass transit
of the future, the P.R.C. struggles along raising
rates and losing passengers, then again increasing
fares and dropping still-more riders; it constantly
revises schedules because of decreased service, and.
generally aggrevates the devil out of those “stuck”
with riding the trolleys.

Same Situation Here
The University aparently faces a similar crisis.

Tuition   an

  

ing potential students from‘ enrolling in the Uni-

versity. Last term, the Pittsburgh. Press published
a report stating that ‘high. tuition rates were 5;,

deﬁnite “factor ‘discouraging new -freshmen frornj .

entering the University.’ V
Everyone remembers» the promises ‘that, 1800
would register as fr.,eshmen’,in the -19,61 .f‘a1/1‘_, tri-
mester —— everyone] also remembers that little over‘
a thousand actuallyshowed up. This "same ‘report

also urged the "administration to “hold ithejline» 

with tuition rates and ‘postpone any future. .in-
creases. Six weeks later, ‘students-received" a,'Chri‘st..
mas present in terms of another price boost. ’

So tuition ‘continues, up and up and The

 

need for better instructors is indeed urgentsana r 

necessary if the University must continue. its re...
naissance, but there is also, the possibility that ’th"e7
new professors may‘ be teaching only themselves.
because of nearly empty classrooms.. ‘With each‘ tui-3»
tion increase, the percentage ofpotential Pitt Stli.‘
dents decreases because high school seniors‘ are’,
seeking other less..expensive' colleges offieringlhighi.
er education of equal or better quality than the.
University of Pittsburgh.
Plight-s -Are Similar

These situations, call them “crises” if you wish,
are definitely alike: prices go up and the number
of people affected decreases. Should Pittsburgh
Railways price themselves out of business, the
mass transit authority can eventually absorb the

company and put it back on its feet. Should the 

University price itself practically out of business
(and it looks like it is certainly‘ going to in under-

graduate areas of study), the helping-hand of the ‘

state would not be available for state-support has
already been rejected.

The only‘ alternative would be the conversion
of the Cathedral into a‘ parking garage, but with

Students are no longer primarily interested in ‘social
brotherhood, Hell Week, and intramural sports but have
turned their minds to those organizations which challenge.

— a person’s thinking.

A 50 per cent idropin fraternity rush sign-up is not
the only indication that students are turning away, from
the strictly social group. In the past two years organizations-
such as Student Sane, ‘Society for Conservative Studies, the

* Inquiry Club, Pittsburgh New Left, and the most recent,

The Marxist Philosophy, have become important on this
campus. '
Whether one agrees with the ideas or ideals of any or
all of these groups, he at least, has something to think about.
Fraternities, on the other .hari;;:rf,/‘piromote such discussion
only as an afterthought. Even the faculty-student discus-
sions sponsored periodically are means to better faculty-
student relationships with little, if any thought, given to

the possible intellectual stimulation that might arise from
, such programs. P ,

Granted, fraternities are, ﬁrst of all, social organiza-
tions, but if they intend to survive they must become some-
thing more. Before going after the “sharp guy” or the “guy
with the 3.6 or the 3.8 who has something on the ball,”
fraternity men should consider what they have to offer

The almost annual tuition increases are discourag— the students gone, who would be around to use it?‘

Editor, The Pitt News:
Campus radio. station WPGH is
to be congratulated for its ﬁne
work during the ﬁrst‘ days of
operation. Despite the -poor re-
ception in various parts of the
Quadrangle and the obvious
technical difficulties encounter-
ed in initiating broadcasts of a
new radio station, the students
appreciate the ﬁne music (which
is better than the music on most .
other stations), news and sports
reports, and inforrnationa

Of special interest during the
ﬁrst week of operation were the
interviews with ‘Dr. Alan C.
Rankin, — Chancellor ~ Litchﬁeld,
the report on student govern-
ment and its troubles, and last
week, the playback of the Mid-
day Series program of Robert
Penn Warren.

‘It is hoped that the station,
will eventually revise its pro-
gramming schedules and expand
service intothe afternoon, the

ends.

DIRECTOR CHARLES GORDON BROVVN and technicians Alan

Lhota and John‘Shelton line up a

shot for a new promotional movie

being produced for the University by televisionstation VVQED. The
film features classroom and extra-curricular activities.

Teaching Process, Activities

To Highlight New Production

Cameras and klieg lights

are being rolled through the

Cathedral as a crew from WQED ﬁlms a promotion movie

for the University.
“The ﬁlm, which will be

completed in March or April,

is being made to show both the teachinglearning process at

the University and the extra—curricular activities here,” said.

Alvschadt, of the University pub-9

lic relations department.

Shooting of Panther football
games, scenes from their training
and locker rooms and the players’
training tables has already been
completed. _

The Nationality Rooms have
been photographed and now
various professors and groups
of students ‘are being photo-
graped in 332 CL. ,0 They were
selected to give overall balance
to various sections of the Uni-
versity. Some are actual class-
es; others are staged.

Original plans called for ca ﬁlmi

to be shown to footballvteam re-
cruits but they have now been
expanded to include showing the
ﬁnished product to. all prospec-
tive University students and at
freshman orientation. '

Off-campus shots of area soda
fountains and coﬁee houses will
be included. Students here will
probably have a chance to see the
movie, Schadt said.

Last spring, the United States
Information agency produced
a movie about the University.
Entitled “Tower of Learning,”
the film was primarily conccrn- .
ed with ex-chancellor Bowman
and the Cathedral. It will be
shown abroad.

At the same time the “Tower”
ﬁlm was being produced, USIA
cameramen were gathering foot-
age-of the University to‘ be used
for a feature about various U. S.
campuses. A copy of this movie,
“Centers of.Learning,” is available
and will probably be shown to
University secretaries and staff
members. ‘

Wrestlers Score Easy Win Over Army, 20-11

By Bob SMIZIK

Early last week Wrestling
Coach Rex Peery looked over
Army's lineup against Maryland
and said, “If they use that lineup
against us, we’ll beat them easy.”
Army used pretty much the same
lineup on Saturday at West Point
and the Panthers did “beat them
easy,” 20-ll.

Peery had expected a much
tougher match from the Cadets
and would have gotten it except
for troubles that beset two of
Army's best men, Al Rushatz and
Mike Natvig.

Rushatz, an Eastern champion‘

in 1960 and runner-up last year,
did not perform due to a rib
separation. Natvig,
one of the East’s best 147 pound-
ers failed to make that weight
and had to wrestle at 157 pounds.

considered,

 

Jim Harrison Tom Jeff:-ies

=l‘- * =5:

With Rushatz out of the lineup
the Cadets lost an almost sure
victory and Natvig’s' failure to
make his weight may have cost
the Soldiers another win.

Stronger at 147

Even though Natvig won his
match over Augie Arrigone, his
team would have been a lot

stronger ifi.1e had been at 147

pounds, where he had a 59-50
chance of beating Daryl Ke1ving-
ton, and it Al McElhose or Rob
Vanneman would have been at
157 pounds where they would
have been favored to beat Arri-
gone.

Sophomore Ken Barr scored
the clinching victory for the
Panthers’ when he thrashed
Clint Seward, 37-0. Barr had
been scheduled to take on Ru-
shatz, but the last minute re-
prieve enabled him to chalk up
his second collegiate win in as
many tries.

Jim Harrison scored the only
pin of the day for the Cats when
he put Buzz Kriesel’s shoulders
to the mat with 4:53 left to go.

Natvig’s defeat of Arrigone was

no disgrace to the Panther and
came as a surprise to many due
to the closeness of the score, 6-4.
Natvig, an Eastern runner-up last

the oft-defeated Arrigone.

Maryland
Thrashes

Swimmers

By LEN BERENFIELD
Following impressive victo-
ries over West Virginia and
Lehigh,
hoped to run their string of
wins to three straight against
Maryland. The Panthers were
also out to avenge last year’s de-

feat by the Maryland team.
Both of these aspirations were
drowned in the Carnegie Tech

pool last Saturday, however, as
the Maryland squad sent the Cats

It looked like family night at.

the Tech pool as the Levine twins,
Rob and Ron, led the Pitt effort,
while Ted and Hugh Lupien
sparked Maryland’s victory. Ted
copped the 200 yard breatstroke
for the Terps, while brother Hugh
brought home a victory in the
200 yard butterfly.
Some Shine
In spite of the defeat, there
were many bright spots on the
Pitt squad. Sophomore star Bob
Levine broke the Pitt record for
the 200 yard backstroke for the
second time in two weeks. He
swam the distance in 2211.8, low-
ering the mark he had set only
two weeks ago at West Virginia.
Steve Ganong brought home
the bacon for the Blue and
Gold in the 440 yard free style,
leaving him and Bob Levine
with the only unbeaten records
, on the Panther team.
Commenting on the Maryland
team, Pitt coach Ben Grady had
this to say, “Maryland is an ex-
cellent, well-balanced team, and
I didn’t think we would do as
well against them as we did.”
“Our boys have been improving,”
continued Grady, “and if they
keep on improving I will be
satisﬁed."

was Bob Pingatore’s performance.

Pingatore, a questionable com-

doubt concerning his value to the
team by taking a first on the long
horse, a second on the horizontal
bar, and a third in the floor exer-
cise.

 Mountie Star Nets 30;

General Tops With 31

By JIM O'BRIEN
MORGANTOWN, West. Va. —- Thecharrninig Mountain-
eer hosts rolled out a red carpet for the Panthers at their
ﬁghting cock pit Saturday night. This is’ no cliche, except the
rug was blue and gold, and the rude ﬁve which Coach George

King chose to entertain the

visitors promptly pulled the

rug out from under the Cats, and streaked to a hard-fought

88-78 win. 0

Rod Thorn, the angular featur-
ed guard of the Mounties who was
little more than a burr in the side
of the Panthers
in last year’s _
two meetings,
was impossible.
Heaving t w o -
handed j u m p 1
shots from the
ﬁrst row of the
stands, he hit
12 field goals,
and led the
victors with 30
points. enera ovich

Thorn wasn’t the only guy with-

.a deft touch. Brian Generalovich

followed up his 29 point output at
Columbia with a 31 point exhibi-
tion, tossing in short jumpers and
sliding across the key hole and
scoring with more English on the
ball than even cue-wizard Willie
Mosconi could have applied.
The Mountaineers, however,

 

lhad four fellas in double ﬁgures,

and Pitt one less. The winners
-conquered by an even double fig-

“ ure —— 10 points. Ben Jinks and

Cal Sheffield scored 21 and 13

points respectively for the losers.
Pitt closed the gap to two
points with seven minutes gone
in the second canto, but couldn’t
restrain Thorn & Co. “Oh, that

Thorn!” Coach Bob Timmons
moaned. “He is a great ball-
player without question. We

couldn’t stop him, and we werc
on him all the time."

“When ‘YOU play that many
sophomores,” Mountie C o a c h
George King remarked about the
four newcomers inlthe Pitt line»-
up, “it’s very encouraging.”

_ All King’s Iears were dismissed
when the crowd whipped up some
fearsome momentum when the
Cats got close. It sounded like a
tunnel with a locomotive coming
through it. It was organized panic.

  AFTERTHOUGHTS

Prior to the Pitt—Syracuse wrestling match on January
13, Coach Rex Peery was shuffling about the red carpet of
theiStudent Union lobby, ‘somewhat concerned about the
upcoming meet. ‘His team had just eaten their breakfast,
.  " " and I ﬁgured that perhaps some of his stars
were suffering from ptomaine poisoning.
“I’m a_ little disappointed,” Peery re-
marked. “Some of. Syracuse.’s men did not
make their best weight class,and their best
man is injured. It won’t be a tough match.”
Can you imagine football coach,
John ‘Michelosen, murming to himself
before the Penn State football game, “I
feel so bad, Galen Hall won’t be able
to play; todiiy.”

It was four-thirty in the afternoonat the Field House
on the day of the Cincinnati—Duquesne basketball game
which was a sell—out two weeks earlier. Groundskeeper Leo
“Horse” Czarnecki was snooping about the interior of the
FH, opening the lids of the large garbage cans to see if
there were any kids hiding inside, awaiting the game that
night. , -

When a Pitt student admitted that he

the Steel Bowl, Beano Cook ‘was at odds
with him. ,

“But l’ve always been a Duquesne fan,”
the lad cried. “And besides they have a .,
chance to go somewhere.”

“That’s like rooting .for .Russia
against Puerto Rico because they have
a chance to go somewhere,” Beano re-

If you’re a Rens basketball fan, don’t_ hold your breath
waiting for Wayne Hightower to appear in the lineup next

that’s where the ‘Philadelphia Warriors sent him. He s

“You can’t say that Duquesne’s Willie Somerset is
better than Don Hennon yet,” “Doc” Carlson claims.
“He’s-not nearly the offensive ballplayer that Don was
— he can’t do nearly as many things so well. It could
be true that he’s better defensive-wise.”

To which Billy Mauro, coaching aide of the frosh cagers
and one—time teammate of Hennon, says, “Let’s wait till they
start double-teaming him and setting intricate defenses for
him alone. No team can afford to lay off of any of the other
Dukes right now.”

Galoshes and Blindfolds?

And let it be said that teams could afford to lay off
 . Hennon’s mates in his days. Jerry Tax Of
Sports Illustrated once wrote: “His team-
mates appear to still be wearing _Butle_r Hen-

basketball action
gets under way today in the Sta-

ator of the intramural leagues has
announced that the 55 teams en-
tered have been put

._ Intramural

into nine

The 21 independent teams have
been grouped into four loops, the
West, with six teams, East, North
and South. According to Bemis
“the West is the strongest of the
independent leagues on the basis
of what the teams have done in

when a darlchorse will crop up.”

Fraternity teams have been
divided into two sections, one of
eight teams and the other
seven. Likewise the dormitory
teamsvhave been put into two di-
visions with sixteams in each.
There will be one Engineering
League with seven teams entered
in it.

Plans right now call forhaving
intra-league playoffs, ,probably
with the top two'iteams in each
section entered, and having

The Panther Freshman squash

i team is ﬁelding some promising

material. Among those cited by
man and Andy Siegenfeld.

“It is seldom,” Pope said, “that
anyone gets a game from Hart-
man.” Dave O’Loughlin, Pitt’s
number two squash player, and
one of the few to beat Hartman,
has turned the trick twice.
Siegenfeld, starting late, began
as number thirteen man on the
freshman team and now has
worked himself up ‘to n_umber

“shows the virtue of practice”
and that “he is determined to suc-

Switch In Positions 0 Bother
For Wrestling Te’-Zlikoff

By BOB SMIZIK

After spending two highly
successful years wrestling in
the 147-pound weight divi-
sion, John vZolikof'f, veteran
Pitt matman, has been
switched to the 137-pound
division by Coach Rex Peery.

According to Peery the switch
was necessary because “Daryl
Kelvington our regular 137
pounder was getting too heavy
for the division and John is ac-
tually a little smaller than Daryl.” _

Being taken out of a position at 
which he has attained great suc-

athletes, but Zolikoff, although he
is not completely happy about the
change, realizes that “it is for the
good of the team.”
Tough Competition

Of course, Zolikoff is concerned

about his own chances in the new ‘

and Lehigh’s Curt Alexander are

In his typical confident style

Zolikoff ended by saying, “but
don’t get me wrong, I’m sure I
can beat these guys.”

Coach Peery has been well
pleased with the switch thus
far. “John looked real good
