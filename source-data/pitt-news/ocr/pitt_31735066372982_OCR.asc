Despite the cutoff of funding by
the university, Pitt’s Women’s
Center will continue to offer servi-
ces because of a grant received by a
private organization and offers by

other organizations to cover its.

educational services.

The center is going through a
reorganization stage as director
Cynthia Vanda will operate within
the provost’s office representing
women’s interest within the
university.

One outside organization that
has shown interest in taking over
the finances of the Women’s Center
is Women in the Urban Crisis Inc.
(WIUC), whose purpose is to pro-
vide information for Pittsburgh
women. The Women’s Center has
traditionally done this, but also
offers counseling services.

Betty Pickett, president of
Women in Urban Crisis Inc., said
that her organization became inter-
ested in acquiring the Women’s
Center services during the time the
center was on the verge of closing.

“We took interest in the situa-
tion around late spring-early
summer ,” Pickett said. “The two
organizations have common goals
and ”we would co-operate in order
to keep the services going.” '

Pickett said she sent a letter of

intent to Vanda. The letter said

ices” with the university, provided
that the organization would be
allowed to use the building rent-
free for a minimum of three to five

of directors, but a final approval
from the board is necessary in order
to have any action taken.

For Stefan Wray, the indictment
of ihose who have failed to register
for the draft is not an abstract
occurrence, but a very real and per-
sonal experience. Many of his
friends are facing indictment, as he
may in the near future.

Wray is a 21-year-old resident of
Pittsburgh. He attended a college
in Indiana and currently works at
the Peace Center in the Quaker
Meeting House on Ellsworth
Avenue in Shadyside. He is organ-
izing a group of young people
who, like himself, have chosen not
to register for the draft.

The primary function of the
group is mutual support, Wray
says. Members of the group share
their experiences and feelings
about the current draft situation
and keep in contact with each
other.

The possibility of the group's
becoming more‘ politically active
in the future, he said, is dependent
on the circumstances surrounding
the draft and the amount of interest
generated by Pittsburgh's young

response, but Pickett said that she

had not seen the letter, nor has a
meeting of the board been called.

“Since the letter has come, we
can call a meeting, but it won’t take
place before August,” Pickett said.

The letter sent to WIUC by Pitt
said the university is very interested
in ‘the. proposal and input from
other organizations with similar
goals will also be examined.

There has been one meeting
between‘ Pickett and Sam Deep,
assistant to. the provost, to discuss
the matter. According to Pickett,
Deep said that the possibility of
moving into the center has to be
cleared by the provost’s office.

According to Deep, in addition
to WIUC, the YWCA was also wil-

ling to help run the center.

“The YWCA offered to move in
as one of the tenants to provide ser-
vices,” Deep said. ‘

There is a reorganization going
on within the center. Vanda will
become an advocate for women’s
interests within the university,
while the university’s financial
support of the center will be cut off.

“These responsibilities which
will be defined will have to be
approved by the provost,” Deep
said. V

Deep was originally developing
a planning and resource manage-
ment system (PRMS) document to
outline the direction for women’s

services, but decided to give an .

informal proposal to the provost

office.

“I submitted a proposal stating A

what should be done (with the cen-
ter),” Deep said. “It is the same
information provided, but it won't
go through the PRMS process.

Deep said that Vanda’s new role .
would be beneficial to the center. .

“—Vanda’s role, along with the I

direct services that will be offered,
will be more positive,” Deep said.

According to Deep, the discus-
sion between organizations and,
reactions to the new proposal have
been very good.

All the letters that I have received
have been positive,” Deep said.
“No one has openly disagreed with
the proposal. All responses have
been good.

Confronts Registration

people.

Wray‘ believes that when a per-
son decides not to register for the
draft, it helps to prevent an unne-
cessary military build—up by the

Pentagon.
He also said this decision
changes an individual from

within—he assumes more respon-
sibility for his own decisions and
actions. '

He said most people blindly
accept things the way theyarewith-
out trying to change them.

“This culture trains people to be
obedient and not to question,” he
said. “From the minute we’re born,
we learn through the family to be
obedient to the father; in church,
obedience to God; in school, obe-
dience to the teacher; in the factory,
obedience to the boss.

“There’s this hierarchical set-up
in which there are people above
and people below, and the people
below are held at bay and taught
not to question. This rubs off on
every aspect of our lives so that not
as many people will question
things like war.” . .

Wray stated that the generation
of the '80s cannot afford to be shel-

tered from the realities -of social
developments.

“We grow up in this culture in
which we are enclosed in a kind of
womb—we don't know what’s
going on around us. ’

“You grow up and you learn
about the rest of the world through
TV and radio. The schools don’t
teach us about what’s going on.
The history classes only teach us
about the history of wars and we
learn very little about social move-
ments and movements of change,”
he said.

Wray sees change as being a pro-
cess that takes place both internally
and externally. To Wray, change is
both personal and social.

“Change comes first from
changing yourself, changing the
way you think about the world. It
comes from changing the belief
that you can't do anything to say-
ing ‘yes,’ you can do something.”

To him, resisting draft registra-
tion is an act of affirmation. It is a
positive decision to change the
world for the better by refusing to
contribute to what he believes is
injustice.

He believes people should exer-

cise their power to bring about
change—people must decide to
take action. e «
“If people think that they're
powerless, then they are powerless-
If they think they have power, if
they think they have strength, if
they think they have the ability to
change things and to create some-
thing new, then they do,” he said. —
Wray’s decision not to register
for the draft is connected with his
refusal to ignore things happening

 in today’s world.

“It’s coming to the point where
you can’t ignore things," he said.
“You can’t ignore the fact that the
Lebanese people are being slaught-
ered with U.S.-made military
equipment just like the people in
El Salvador. We are all a part ‘of
that, but people don’t see the
connections." '

Making connections is some-
thing of which Wray believes most
people don’t do enough. He
believes seeing connections
between various things helps to
enhance one’s understanding of
the world.

“It’s good to link the draft with

R03‘ 5ald- "A mal°T Pmblem f0T P5)/' Qovemmem as we" as the d€f¢"_5e‘- under such a defect of f that challenging its constitutionality

By PEGGY FERRI chiatry is that the law has traditionally they counterbalance. The defense disease of the mind, aSr::$t(:3’k]r.%r\T,

John Hinckley was acquitted by
reason of insanity recently, but it
seems that this particular defense
itself is on trial. The insanity defense
is currently being seriously debated
and reevaluated.

This defense has withstood critics’
attatks that it is an "easy out" for
criminals, relies too much on psychi-
atrie testimony, or deﬁes all deﬁni-
tions, but Congress and many state
legislators are now‘ denouncing the
defense.

The defense has been abolished in
Idaho, but bills in 24 other states-
including Pennsylvania-would
replace it with a new plea of guilty but
mentally ill. Brieﬂy, the individual
found guilty but mentally ill would be
subject to treatment, and, if later
found to be “cured”, the individual
would finish his sentence in prison.

Dr. Loren Roth, director of the law
and psychiatry program at the West-
ern Psychiatric Institute and Clinic
and associate professor of Psychiatry
at Pitt, testiﬁed in March before a
Senate subcommittee on the merits
of Senate Bill Number 171, which
would abolish the insanity defense.

According to the testimony tran-
script, Dr. Roth stated that the bill's
deﬁnition of “mentally ill" needs to
be reﬁned, and that consideration
must be given to the lack of resour-
ces available in the criminal justice
and mental health systems for han-
dling these types of criminals. ,

"Some form of the insanity
defense or its equivalent is probably
required in a civilized, society," Dr.

asked psychiatrists questions.that
they cannot answer—who is or is not

insane."

He added that psychiatrists are
asked to provide conclusions con-
cerning the ultimate legal issue of
sanity or insanity‘. He said this is a
moral and social issue that relates to
the moral structure of responsibility
and not to psychiatric testimony.

The existence of the insanity
defense is not itself the problem,

. according to Dr. Roth. Instead, Roth

contends, it is the fact that under the
doctrine of equal protection, persons
who have committed acts are now
released more rapidly from mental
hospitals that consternates the
public.

"It is a major social and societal
policy mistake to extend the doctrine
of equal protection under the law to
persons who have been found not
guilty by reason of insanity," he said.

Thomas A. Daley, chief of the

Criminal Division of the (LS. Attor- I

ney's Office, has his doubts about
guilty but insane proposals. Daley
said he would rather see the defense
stay as it is with the possible modiﬁ-
cation that the burden of proof be
shifted so that the defense would
have to prove insanity. '

“I think that the current re-
evaluation of the defense is a good
thing," Daley said. “In the Hinckley
case, thejury reached an unexpected
verdict, but juries are not prone to
acquit an individual on the basis of
psychiatric testimony.”

“There are psychiatrists for the

ﬁnds that the defendant is insane, the
government reaches the opposite
conclusion, and, in the end, thejury
decides," Daley said.  . .

“Ours is not a perféct“"s'ysf‘e"r‘i'l,”
Daley continued, “your fate is up to
the jury. When you cannot accept the
verdict... you cannot just tear down
the structure of the law."

"In short, the Hinckley case has
had a great impact,” he said, “but
time will lessen that impact.

"Congress will probably try to
amend the defense, but I think that
articulate spokesmen will argue in
opposition," Daley said.

One defense attorney who said
that he would “gladly” challenge the
constitutionality of such a law is H.
David Rothman. Rothman was
appointed by Federal Court in 1961
as defense attorney in the case Lini-
ted States vs. Currens.

Currens, a 22-year-old who trans-
ported a stolen car across a state
line, was a sociopath who knew the
difference between “right and
yvrong," but would not adhere to the

right," according to Rothman.

The case was signiﬁcant because
it was successful in getting Pennsyl-
vania, New Jersey, and Delaware to
adopt the Durham Rule, that “an
accused is not criminally responsible
of his unlawful act was the product of
mental disease or mental defect.”

Prior to this, the M’Naughten test
of “right and wrong" was followed.
Under this rule, it must be proved
that at the time of committing the
act, the individual was “laboring

the nature and quality of the act he
was doing; or if he did know it, that he
did not know he was doing what was

.wrong,".~  . .

Wllerhrlsyliiania has not changed the
M’Haughten test, but mental disease
or defect is allowed to be introduced
to reduce first degree murder to
voluntary manslaughter, according
to Rothman.

“It's not a complete defense,"
Rothman added. "The trouble is that
it doesn't give psychiatrists the
opportunity to testify as physicians."

Rothman holds that the insanity
defense should not be modiﬁed or
abolished.

“Sure, they'll‘ change the, law
because of Hinckley until some Con-
gressman's son goes crazy and kills
somebody-and then they'll change
it back again." _

Rothman said the insanity
defense is utilized because society
has decided that it is “'rnhumane" to
put people who are not in their
rational minds, behind bars.

"if you eliminate the defense or the
opportunity to produce evidence
from the psychiatrists that the person
lacked the requisite state of mind to
commit a crime, then you have to
change the criminal law," Rothman
said. '

“I don't know how they’re going to
confront the issue-—'yes, you have
to prove a criminal state of mind and
this man didn’t have a criminal mind
because he’s insane, but he’s still
guilty,‘ " Rothman explained. He
does anticipate that a change in the

law will come about, but also said»

Pitt law professor John M. Burk-
hoff argues for abolishing the
defense entirely.

“The, current defense doesn't
work,"iBurkhoff explained. its not
sensible—it hurts craz_y peaﬁe
because no treatment is gua ....-
teed." _

He added that he is in favor of the
guilty but mentally ill plea,_but only
because it is halfway to getting rid of
the defense altogether.

The idea that eliminating the
defense is unconstitutional makes
sense to Burkhoff, but he argues that V
the defense is already unfair.

“In addition,” he said, “there is
more than one goal for punishment.
it's not just individual blameworthi-
ness, but it reﬂects other interests as
well, like general deferrence and
issues of retribution."

Concerning the role of psychia-
try, Burkhoff said the problerg ‘gs
that lawyers and psychiatrists have
thought that the system asks psy-
chiatrists to make the legal decision.

"All the current system asks for is
psychiatric input as to the mental
state of a defendant. Then the jury
decides,” he explained. "The jury
thinks they are there to listen to the
dueling psychiatrists—— not so." I

Burkhoff favors the elimination of
the insanity defense because more
people will be identiﬁed and treated,
but what happens if a rule is not
followed?

"Sue the hell out of them," Burk-
hoff answered. “"The defense has to
yell and scream like hell if defendants
don't get the treatment to which they
are entitled." 

He recalled that in Michigan (the
ﬁrst state to adopt the guilty but men-
tally ill plea), defense attorneys ﬁled
lawsuits for this reason and the state
responded with the construction of a
new psychiatric facility.

“Adopting guilty but mentally ill, or

abolishing the defense altogether

probably won’t make things great,”
Burkhoff admitted. “It will probably
make things crummy, but they’ll be
better than they are.”

Concerning his “faith in psychia-
try”, Burkhoff said that- sometimes

treatment may facilitate the recovery .

of the insane patient so they will “ﬁt in
better”. , '

“I think that. (Pitt philosophyi\_¥o-
fessor Adolf Grunbaum argues t at
you can substitute a good bar-
tender," he added. "Fine, if you had a
system where -we could get good bar-
tenders, then Ill take it."

Since the Hinckley verdict was
handed down, various articles have
examined the relationship between
law and psychiatry. I

Western Pennsylvania United‘

States District Judge Edward Dum-
bauld adheres strongly to the law and
the necessity for the insanity defense.
He also admitted that there is a lot of
grey matter surrounding deﬁnitions,
but that the courts do not allow philo-
sophical debates.

“The insanity defense relates ti"

criminal liability at the time of come‘

mitting the act," he explained. “The
state of a man's mind is as much a
fact as the state of his digestion, you
know.

“There is no utility in changing the
existing law if it is satisfactory and
sufficient," he added.

Judge Dumbauld said that he
believes it is good to have so much
discussion about the Hinckley ver-
dict, but added that he prefers to see
the insanity defense stay as it is.

"We concentrate on the proof of
facts and the vast array of difference

of opinion to be expected in an‘ 

case," he said. “Thecooperatiorgg 
psychiatry and law, where the
spheres of determinism_and free will
can intersect, is helpful to the work of
the courts and the aim of justice," he
said.

blew Frat Housing

  May Begin Soon

By JEFF RUSSELL

After overcoming several obsta-
cles, Pitt is finally moving forward
with plans to build a housing com-
plex for several fraternities, accord-
ing to Jack Freeman, senior vice
chancellor for administration.

gﬁtlroundbreaking for the frater-
iiity residences, which are to be
located at the corner of University
Drive and Alliquippa Street, could
take place as early as October, Free-

. man ‘said. The fraternities could

begin to occupy the new complex
by January 1984. A

In order to begin construction on
the residences, Pitt needs coopera-
tion from local residents and com-
mitment _from the fraternities.

Pitt designed the fraternities
with cooperation from Oakland

residents and People’s Oakland, a

community group. Pitt adminis-

trators are hoping this mutual
effort will lessen friction over the
posal, Freeman said.

1 itt received commitments in the
form of $50,000 deposits from eight
fraternities.

“(Pitt administrators) will be
meeting with them soon for the
purpose of selecting the house they
want and signing leases,” Freeman
said.

The eight fraternities are Delta
Tau Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Theta Chi, Sigma_Chi, Phi Kappa
Theta, Zeta Beta Tau, Pi Kappa
Alpha and Delta Sigma Delta.

Although plans for the housing
complex appear definite, some
local residents are still not satisfied
with Pitt's plans. Some residents
are worried that the fraternities
will bring noise, “undesirables”

‘ﬁnd traffic, their biggest concern.

“Ron Coleman, of the Brackenridge

Street Citizen's Group, would not

comment on the matter until he

met with others in the group.
The ‘housing should cost “about

$3.8 million," according to Free- ,

man, and will be financed by
$100,000 from each fraternity, and
about $3 million from th Allegh-
eny County Bonding Authority.
The $3 million will eventually

be repaid through rent received
from the fraternities,_ he said.

Each fraternity in the complex
will have a kitchen, dining area,
lounge and game room of its own
and will be able to house 25‘ people,
according to Freeman. Each build-
ing will house two fraternities.

Since the fraternities will be on
campus, they will be under the
jurisdiction of the campus police,

Freeman said. The fraternitieswill_

also be subject to house rules set by
a joint effort of the university and
the fraternities.

There are several benefits for the
fraternities in the new housing
complex, according to Freeman.
Among these benefits are “a good,
solid structure, better designed for
modern fraternity ‘needs. (The

housing is) close to the dorms (and)
exterior maintenance will be taken

care of by Pitt. There is an oppor-
tunity for togetherness among
Greeks,” Freeman said.

young people who have not yet
registered for the draft have done so
for reasons other than political
protest. One example, Wray said, is
absentmindedness. I

He said the threats of imprison-
ment may cause some people to
register, but others, he said, will
become enraged and angry at what
the government is doing. People
will see the need to speak out
against it.”

organized fills a need for young
people today. T

of support for young people so that
they can share some of their fears
and feelings about this...because
there is a real threat, especially if
they start to indict people,” Wray
said. ‘
Wray said that the life of a draft
resister is not an easy life to live; it
would be much easier if he regis-
tered, but he believes that resisting
the draft is something he must do.
He said the worst thing about;
registration and the continuation
of the arms race is that he no longer
feels confident about the future of

humanity.

Budget
Cutting

"It was probably inevitable.

During the past year, the College of Arts I

and Sciences Advising Center has faced staff
reductions and other cuts.

The center, which employs graduate stu-
dents to advise undergraduates on classes,
majors and career decisions, attempted to
cope in various ways with the reductions.
Increased adviser workloads and financial
help from other sources within the univer-
sity, including the CAS dean’s office, are
examples. ’ V

All along however, Pitt administrators
made it clear that a fully staffed advising
center was not a top priority despite recom-
mendations that the center was important
in retaining students. In terms of numbers,
the new advising staff will be reduced by
seven for the 82-83 school year.

In the past each adviser ‘handled 100-110
students per term, but each will now be
forced to take up to 40 more students per
term. ,

The numbers, however, don’t describe
the actual effects of the cuts.

Sophomores who are unsure about their
majors will be pressured into choosing one
early because the center will no longer be
able to spend adequate time with each of
them. A

“An individual can only make intelligent
decisions about what they want to do after

they have explored some options,” said

adviser Bob Friday.

Because of the cuts, those options will
remainunexplored. It is ironic that a uni-
versity which demonstrates its belief in the
importance of a liberal arts education by
passing curriculum reforms should make it
difficult for students to sample different
academic subjects.

Despite some university support and
calls for increased funding for the center,
the reductions continue to be made.

On behalf of those students uncertain
about the next step in their academic
careers, we ask that university administra-
tors reconsider these particular cuts and
thus show some consistency with their pre-
vious statements about liberal education.

Pitt Policeman ‘Strange’ 

Dear. Editor:

While going over some back
issues of The Pitt News, I came
across the letter from Joseph
Forbes complaining about having
been followed some distance and
harrassed for no reason by a Pitt
campus policeman and the letter
from "university employee Chuck
Grady defending the conduct of the
campus policeman.

I'm amazed that Chuck Grady
could write such a letter. And he
got the matter confused. It wasn’t
Mr. Forbes’ letter that was
“strange”——-it was clearly the con-
duct of the campus policeman that
was strange.

After thinking it over, I am in
100 percent agreement with Mr.
Forbes. There .does seem to have
been something peculiar about the
conduct of the Pitt campus
policeman.

If the campus policeman did not
think that Mr. Forbes belonged in
the Cathedral of Learning, why
didn’t he stop Mr. Forbes when Mr.
Forbes passed him on the sidewalk,
instead of waiting some_ time and
Forbes enter the

center of the building, mail some
letters and go to the elevators? It
doesn’t make sense. ..

I can't believe the story that he
didn't recognize Mr. Forbes as a
regular visitor, since it is impossi-
ble to recognize all the regular vis-
itors who come in from the several
entrances. And there are many le-
gitimate non-regular visitors. Why
aren't they all stopped and
questioned? _

Again, if the campus policeman
didn’t recognize Mr. Forbes as a
regular visitor, why didn’t he stop
Mr. Forbes on the sidewalk, instead
of letting Mr. Forbes enter and then
following him? (My impression is
that the campus policeman was
using his position to play some sort
of bizarre game with Mr. Forbes.).

The warning to Mr. Forbes
about not “wandering around”
was a rather rude thing for a cam-
pus policeman to say to someone
there for a legitimate purpose and
about to enter an elevator to make a
scheduled appointment. Is every
legitimate visitor warned not to
“wander around?" ,

Just for the sake of argument,
suppose Mr. Forbes had walked
around a bit, to admire the beauti-
ful craftsmanship of the Cathedral
of Learning after his appointment

was over? What harm could Mr.

Forbes have done? Lots of people
come to see the Cathedral of Lea rn—
ing. and there are even guided
tours. Why wasn't that campus
policeman concerned about all the
other people who wander around
the Cathedral every day?

Why was he so concerned about

Mr. Forbes, who wasn't wanderi.ng
around anyway, but rather. was on
his way to keep an appointment. It
doesn’t make sense.

I happen to be interested in this
matter because I have seen the same
policeman that Mr. Forbes de-
scribed in his letter. Once, when I
got off the elevator, I saw him sit-
ting on a chair on the ground floor
of the Cathedral of Learning,
slouched, hugging his -portable
radio, with his legs spread apart.
He had an unusual expression on
his face, as if he were on the verge of

crying. And he looked as if he were
going to fall out of his chair.

On another occasion, I saw this
same campus policeman strutting
around with exaggerated steps as if
he were a soldier on parade. And
the third time I saw this campus
policeman was on the fifth floor on
the Cathedral of Learning; he was
walking around with a strange
look on his face staring at the floor.
He gave me the creeps.

‘Illegal’ Actions 

Dear Editor:

Considering the tone of Chuck

Grady"s July 7 letter, I can’t help I

wondering if the campus police or
the university administration put
him up to writing it. From what he
said in the letter, he evidently
works for Pitt, and thus he proba-
bly earned a lot of brownie points
for his letter.

I found his letter interesting.
Since I did not, as he claims I did,
make “sweeping generalizations”
in condemnation of . the campus
police force en masse, I wonder
why he felt so strongly the need to
defend them in the manner that he
did.

The contents of his letter did not

actually relate to what I said in my

letter. \

The incident of a criminal court

judge calling some campus police-
men “Keystone Kops” was
reported in the Pittsburgh Press
and in the Post-Gazette. I didn’t
just invent it, as Mr. Grady implies
Idid. ..
I had an incident with the Pitt
police-four years ago, when I lived
in Oakland, which I remembered
when I read Mr. Grady’s claim that
the Pitt police are “thoroughly
professional in every way.”

Four years ago, when I was resid-
ing in Oakland in a building away
from the Pitt campus, the Pitt
police suspected a Duquesne stu-
dent living down the hall from me
of having stolen some items from
the Pitt music department. So they
obtained an illegal search warrant
on insufficient grounds, came to
the building and entered and ran-
sacked the student's apartment.

Then, although I was in no way
‘involved with this student, the Pitt
police went down the hallway to
my place, and even though a
woman from the next floor told the
Pitt cops that I lived there, they
broke down my door and ransacked
my apartment. Then they went up
to the next floor to the apartment of
the woman who had told them I
lived there, not the student they
were looking for, and ransacked
her apartment. Is this what Chuck
Grady means by “thoroughly pro-
fessional in every way?”

Naturally when I came hgﬁ
from work and found my apart-
ment had been illegally broken
into and ransacked by Pitt campus
police ’who had no business off
campus unless in direct pursuit of a
criminal, I was rather upset. (I
wonder how Mr. Grady would feel
if he came home some night and

found his home had been broken‘

into and ransacked by Pitt police.)

I retained an attorney and threa-
tened to sue the university. We had‘
a confrontation with a Pitt attor-
ney like they had escaped from the
“Kojak” TV series. (If Mr. Grady
had been present, he might have a

different opinion of the Pitt”;

police.)

In the end, I decided not to go .

through with my intended lawsuit
because I probably could not have
collected enough in punitive dam-
ages to make it worthwhile.

I wonder how Mr. Grady would
feel if someone broke into his
apartment and vandalized it.

Many Pitt students walk past the
building every day and .don’t even
know what it is. Located across the
street from the Syria Mosque park-
ing lot on Bigelow Blvd., only its
name distinguishes it from the many
other professional buildings in
Oakland—the Western Pennsylva-
nia Historical Society.

After climbing the double stair-
case and entering the building, the
curious will find a storehouse of
information concerning Western
Pennsylvania history at their dispos-
al at no charge. V «

Visitors may walk througha col-
lection of rare glass goblets, decan-
ters and vases, view an exhibit of the
Great Pittsburgh Fires or pick up a
pamphlet about anything from note-
worthy Pittsburgh women to what
the names of Pittsburgh streets
mean. i

use the library and archives for
research free of charge. Materials
are not allowed to circulate, but
photocopy facilities are available.

Spread across two ﬂoors of the
building, the museum contains
items related to the history of West-
ern Pennsylvania with an emphasis
on Pittsburgh.

These items include furniture,
featuring a small writing desk used
by Abraham. Lincoln as a young
man, paintings, prints and models.

The society prides itself for having
what is probably the best collection
of Midwestern glass made in the
years 1800-1870. At that time, half of
the glass produced in the country
was made in Pittsburgh, andabout
650 pieces are displayed in cases in
the hallways of the society building.

A recently received grant will ena-
ble them to build a new permanent
exhibition for the collection.

Group tours of the museum are
available if scheduled two weeks in
‘advance. ‘



to make our history known,” Laban-' '"
ish said. “Not only do we want to
preserve it through the archives and
the museum, but we want to get it
out to the public.”

When the society began in the
1830s, it was a far cry from the for-
mal, organized institution that it is
today. There was no regular, con-
sistent program until 1879.

Originally dubbed the “Old Resi-
dents Society,” it was designed for .
people to get together and hear lec-
tures and reminisce about events‘
that had taken place in the city.

One of the requirements for
membership was aPittsburgh resi-
dency of at least 40 years. «£31

Today the society runs a number’
of programs to make Western Penn-
sylvania residents aware of" the his-
tory of their land.

In addition to a number of Pitt
professors who have addressed
audiences in the past about various
subjects of Western Pennsylvania
interest, the society has also offered

tion on some of the adjoining states
and counties," said John Labanish,
director of the society’s museum.
museum.

The society is organized into four
divisions: the library, . museum,
archives, and publications.

A research library includes nearly
27,000 volumes, newspapers and
periodicals of Western Pennsylva-
nia history. Some of the information
deals with family histories, genealo-
gies and heraldry. A librarian, Mrs.
Helen Wilson, is available during
society hours, from 9:30 to 4:30,
Tuesday-Saturday.

“A lot of people come here tracing
their families,” Labanish said.

The archives contain early Pitts-
burgh business records, family pap-
ers and “all kinds of original
documents dealing with the history
of this area.” '

The archives also include maps of
Pittsburgh and other towns and
counties of Pennsylvania and the
United States, and ‘church and eth-

nic materials. _‘ ' ‘

College students are welcome to .

Dr. William Trimble, editor of the
society's publications, is primarily
responsible for the publication of
the Western Pennsylvania Histori-

cal Magazine, which has been pub-
lished quarterly since 1918.

The Magazine is basically a schol-
arly publication where historians
print research they’ve done in West-
ern Pennsylvania history. It has an
excellent reputation among
historians.

“We pride ourselves in trying to
maintain the quality of the articlesin
the Magazine,” Labanish said, “and
we’re noted for that.”

Members of the Western Penn-
sylvania Historical Society automat-
ically receive a subscription to the
Magazine.

The society began publishing
books in the 1930s. The publishing
house later became the University
of Pittsburgh Press which still pub-
lishes a number of books concern-
ing historical subjects such as
Pittsburgh glass, the French and
Indian War period, Fart Pitt and the
Revolution and author Willa Cather,
a one_-time Pittsburgh resident.

dents have helped in the museum
learning the skills of organizing
archives and cataloging in the

- library.

The possibility of establishing
internships for history majors has 
also been discussed with the univer- . . -
sity, but the project is still in the
developmental stages.

The society also sponsors a free
public lecture series running from,
September to May each year.
Recent lectures have dealt with eth-
nic oral history, the building of the
Panama Canal, Pittsburgh and
Western Pennsylvania glass, Penn-
sylvania painter Benjamin West and
the preservation of the region’s rich
architectural heritage.

Other activities sponsored by the
society include a showing of Alis-
taire Cooke’s “America” series and .. ,-

' one-day bus tours to various histori- "
cal sites in Western Pennsylvania,
‘such at Fort Ligonier. _

Originally sponsored by Pitt, the

Pitt and the Society. ln recent years
it has ben completely run by the

“I think (the programs go back to

burgh, so there was an interest in

Labanish.

programs we’re doing more of this
today than they did in the days when
people got together and talked.”

One way in which the society
keeps interest in the history of
Western Pennsylvania alive is by
out—reach programs to schools and
othergroups. Ranging in age from
 ens groups to senior citizens,
the “society requests a donation
from adult groups, but doesn’t
change schools.

“We’d like to do more of this sort

of thing because there is definitely a
demand for it,” Labanish said. “One
of the needs we have felt strongly is
the need in the schools for teaching
and providing more local history.”

The society is in the process of
making “history kits” which will be
available to local schools next fall.
Each kit will consist of a slide-tape
presentation, instructional mate-
rials for both teachers and students
and artifacts or reproductions.

So far the society has prepared

Recently, the society received
money from the Gulf Oil Corpora-
tion to produce a slide show about
the oil industry. Titled “Oil on the

a . '

Their next major project is to get
additional funding for the perman-
ent glass exhibition.

In addition to that, the society is,
according to Labanish, trying to
“upgradea lot of the things we’ve
n-doing and improve existing
that have been

organization, he said, is to make

Forget that the sport was basketball, when Darrell Gis-

the court, and by opponents—almost nonstop—while
somewhat resembling a blur. He hit 20-footers on the run

drove the lane for what appeared lobe aneasy layup. On
defense he was always near the ball, either jarring it from
an opponent with his quick hands or stealing a pass.

Darrell Gissendanner Signs With Steelers

J

 
 
   
   
  
  
    
     

There was still baseball. For Gissendanner it was more
of the same. Quick movements and thundering feet. Cap-
able of running from home to first base in less than four
seconds. Lou Brock might envy the simplicity with which
Gissendanner steals bases. ’ ‘

A thief? What thief, they always get caught. Not Gissen-
danner, he once stole four bases in a game against Penn
State. Catcher probably felt like a private investigator
working on a case without a lead. Gissendanner, the thief,
had_the only lead. .

And he could hit. Line drives all over the field, shots to
the wall, some homeruns and an occasional bunt just to
show his speed. Quick wrists to get around on the fast-
ball. Fast. .

Again, he-sat by the phone, waiting for a ring from
major league baseball team announcing that he had been A
drafted. Again, it never came. ’

 

 '-

As the baseball and basketball drafts had concluded, Darrell
Gissendanner—who excelled at both of those sports here at Pitt-
wasn’t selected by a professional franchise. He sat by the phone waiting
for the dream call which never came.

Good thing he didn’t disconnect the phone, for the irony was soon to
follow. A Pittsburgh Steeler official ca|led_Gissendanner and offered
him a freeagent contract—which he accepted-—even though he never
played a down of organized football in his life.

What did the Steelers see in Gissendanner? They saw a basketball
player who could race up and down the court in no time and a baseball
player whose base stealing drove catchers crazy. Translated into foot-
ball terms, that means a 4.4 40-yard dash. Gissendanner could come
from no where to deflect an opponent’s pass out of bounds, which is a
good characteristic for a potential defensive back.

Wrestling recruits rank
No. 10...

When the Panther football team
has a banner recruiting year, the
whole sports worldknows about it.
When the Panther wrestling team
recruits several blue-chip pros-
pects, generally little is heard about
it. Head coach Rande Stottlemeyer
believes the team's six recruits will
turn the once-struggling program
into a national power. So does

The.Pitt;Ne.ws, Wednesday, July 21, -1982‘

Amateur Wrestling News, which
ranked Pitt's I982 recruiting class
tenth in the nation.

The ranking was based on three
recruits who were ranked in the top
six in the nation according to their
weight class. Jack Uppling from
Meadville was ranked third in the
nation by the magazine. He has a
state championship under his belt
and a 47-1 record. Kyle Nellis of
Shaler was ranked fifth in the
nation in the 118 lb. class, and Joe

Schweizer signs with
Spirit...

The Pittsburgh Spirit
announced last week that backup
goaltender Rick Schweizer has
signed a contract with the team for
the 1982-83 season. Schweizer
appeared in five games last season,
compiling a 3.13 goals against
average in 134 minutes played. His
first win came in the last game of
the season_ when he defeated the

Major Indoor Soccer League
Champion New York Arrows 5-4.

Schweizer played for three years
at the University of New Haven
where Spirit head coach John
Kowalski was an assistant. The
team plans to use Schweizer as a
second-string goalkeeper in 1982-
83.

dsummer’s Dream

um

Since Peter Brook and the Royal
Shakespeare Company did their
startling production in 1970, direc-
tors have shied away from “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream.” Do it
traditionally and you’re stodgy; do
anything offbeat and you’re a poor
segond to Brook and the British.

“his consideration does not
seem to have daunted director Ste-
phen Kanee, on lend-lease to the
Pittsburgh Public Theatre from
the New Mexico State University.
The “Dream” he has fashioned is a
delightful one—-hip, irreverent,
athletic to the point of gymnastic
and beautifully and imaginatively

«mounted. Kanee has edited the

script to a tight-playing unit and
his energetic cast glides through it
with flawless pacing and eager
abandon.

‘Keith David is an intense-
almost threatening—-Oberon and
there are actors who would sell
their grandmothers’ souls for his
 Jodi Long is a supple and

we Nims, .w'ednésds‘y, stays-ai;é1esgé_*

sensual Titania and her interaction
with her estranged husband
Oberon makes sparks fly.

The surprise of the evening,
though, was J. Smith-Cameron as
Helena. Smith-Cameron was cast

as Hermia, tbu"t- it}/l/Hﬂ)lg‘ﬂ1$iiﬂID[._lSly

released from her contract by the
Public to accept a Broadway— role.
Because of an injured actor, Smith-
Cameron was pressed ito service as
Helena, while her replacement,
Angela Workman, went on as
Hermia. ~ I

Smith.-Cameron played her part
as if she’d been in rehearsal for
months. Her Helena is an adorable
klutz and her sense of comic timing
is finely-tuned. Though she carried
her script in hand, it was never an
obstacle; she barely glanced at it
during the performance.

The bumbling rusticsiwho per-
form the burlesque-like play-
within-the-play are genuinely
funny, with stand-out performan-

 Very Merry Farce

/‘The second production of this

,.~-=~/season’s Three Rivers Shakespeare

 

Festival is thatribald farce, “The
Merry Wives of Windsor.” It is the
only play Shakespeare wrote that
deals fundamentally with the ordi-
nary world of his contemporaries,

. the only full-blow/n Shakespearean

   

farce and‘ the only play in which
most primary characters are from
the middle-class and the low-life

scenes are of town and village life.‘

Such a setting is perfectly
appropriate for farce——in Shakes-

’ p_eare’s day as much as in our

.n/-—and much of the fascination

or" the ‘play derives from how

Shakespeare makes.the mundane
and ordinary so extraordinarily
hilarious.

Into the bourgeoise, townie ver-
sion of Merrie Olde England that is

' Windsor bursts boozy, bawdy Sir

John Falstaff, knight of the
wooden keg, though fatter than
any beer barrel known to man. As
always, Sir John is broke, im-
poverished by his elephantine lust

for capons, cakes, ale and sack .

(Spanish wine).
In “Henry IV,” Falstaff made his
living as a soldier in time of war

’ and a thief in times of peace. Now

hgseeks an easier road to the easy

” e _play revolves around his
plot to seduce two women, the
wives of wealthy‘ Windsor mer-
chants, and buy his sack and ale
with their capitalist husbands’
loot. And so the madcap tale
proceeds. ,

Arthur Beer (what an appro-
priate name for a Falstafflﬁ, who

player king in Hamlet, is a bril-
liant Falstaff. Falstaff must be the
personification of comic vitality,
carreening and reeling through
life, forever mocking and self-
mocking, a clown touched by
genius.

It has been said that in “Henry
IV,” Falstaff was a great and big-
hearted character who consciously
and cunningly allowed himself to
become the source of humor for a
large world, but that there is a di-
minishment of him in “The Merry

. Wives”; he is being mocked by a

small world peopled by small,
coarse characters. But all our lives
are, to some degree, lived in both a
large world and a small world; Fal-
staff has some great moments and
lines in this small world.

Ruth Lesko as Mistress Page and
Kate Young as Mistress Ford are
engaging as the merry wives.
Joseph Pilato as the French physi-
cian Dr. Caiusl is straight out of
Monty Python. Robert Martini, in
a notable departure from his role as
Hamlet, plays Bardolph as a cring-
ing wino geek. [had no complaints
about any of the players.

Naturally, this play is not as
demanding as “Hamlet,”
while the TRSF “Hamlet” lacked
depth while having energy, I have
no such reservations about this
production. .

Director Marc Masterson, the
cast and the other contributors to
the production have created a fine
piece of comic theatre, to run
through July 24. The season’s final
production, “The Tempest,” runs
July 29-August 15.

Ron Faber is a fine Mick Bottom,

‘There's not a mediocre perfor-

mia are handled with deft
originality.

William Schroder’s costumes are
simply terrific, drawing on 19th
century fashion, Greek folk dress
and fairy garb from Middle Earth.
Set designer John Jensen’s work is
both simple and stunning in
impact.

There are few nits to pick with
this “Dream," but the Public’s run-
ning crew was somewhat sloppy
the night I attended. The sound
man has a heavy hand on the musi-
cal fade-outs and the magical effect
of dimming the lights at Puck’s
gesture is spoiled if the light opera-
tor is a beat behind the cues. Musi-
cal director Jeffrey Klotz’s choices
from Bach are appropriate but

uninspired and seem out of tune _

with this imaginative piece of
theatre.

The Core  
of Pittsburgh

When the Jamaican group
Third World came to The Stanley
Theatre recently, the Pittsburgh
band Core opened the show. After

‘ that appearance, Core won a spot

on the bill at Heaven for July 22 for
an entire evening of Caribbean-
influenced rock. _

Core isra seven piece band with
an instrumental lineup of electric
and acoustic guitars, electric bass,
keyboards, harmonica, drums,
congas and various percussive
instruments associated with the
jazz world and the folk music of the
West Indies. The human voice, as
Tony Miles makes evident, is also
an instrument. .

Drums were a means of com-
munication from town to town in
Africa and it is evident why the per-
cussion section assumes _such
importance in the islands of the
Caribbean. While listening to reg-
gae, it is tempting to say that the
messages of percussion are moods
delivered without the customary
syllables of language. The bass is
prominent, and the dialogue
between drums and congas is hyp-
notically fascinating.

Core has had the Decade and
Mancini’s ringing with shouts of
“More Core.” Bassist -Joe Smith,
drummer Ken Crisafio and conga

player Salestriest Bryant constitute
the “core” of the band. Singer
Tony Miles and Smith were both
formerly members of the band
Rastafari. ,

The reggae side of Core has a
complement in blues and rock. Joe
Verri’s acoustic guitar solo on “Cry
Love” has all the.-dreams and poig-
nant sadness of the blues revival
during the Haight-Ashbury flower
child era, the time Verri began his
career.

Kurt Resch’s solo in “Power of a
Woman” is from the rock idiom.
Tom Chockla’s keyboard work is
influenced by the synthesizer hey-
day of the early ’70s. Marc Reisman
of the Iron City Houserockers occa-
sionally sits in with the group on
saxophone.

The group premiered last year at ’

the Shadyside Whole Earth festival

with.a...,repertoire of Bob Marley

tunes. Since then, the band has
developed a playlist made up
almost entirely of original songs.;
‘ The blend of many different
musical traditions in the music of
Core helps to support Third World
drummer Willy Stewart’s belief
that music, when played correctly,
can give a spiritual awakening.

ONE ON ONE
Cheap Trick
Epic

Evolution is at a standstill when
it comes to this foursome; that is
why “One On One" is so good.
Carlos, Zander, Nielson and new-
comer Jon Brant know better than
to stop making good music.

Accessibility is the key to Cheap
Trick and they supply that on this
disc. The present hit, “If You Want
My Love,” is good, but “Oo La La
La" is a killer; the chorus is as sim-
ple as baby talk. That doesn’t mean
the music is immature, just catchy.
Other good cuts are “She's Tight,"
“I Want Be Man" and the title
track. - _ ‘

“One On One” is one for all.

GEORGE HOLZER

OFFRAMP
Pat Metheny Group
ECM

The Pat Metheny ‘ Group's
“Offramp” may be a far, far better
recording than previously achieved
in five or six years as a collective
under the leadership of smooth-
sailing guitarist Metheny.

What makes this album special
is its use of “special guest” Nana
Vasconcelos on percussion.
“Offramp” incorporates the use of
Nana’s voice as an instrument
(much to the disc's advantage) and
mixes some of his clean percussion
into echoes of rich, expansive
sound as effective tonal qualities
conveying mystery, sadness, and
playfulness. It doesn’t quite create
a wall of sound, as reminiscent of
the use of strings during the good
ol’ days at Motown, but it’s close.

Nana appeared most recently on
“As Falls Witchita, So Falls Wit-

t chita Falls,” a collaborative effort

between Metheny and keyboardist
Lyle Mays. “Witchita" wasagift of
a recording for the interplay
between Nana, Mays and Metheny.
They filled the tracks with a free-
handed approach to music, incor-
porating voice, wood chimes,
sounds of children playing, piano,
synthesizers and guitars in a mix of
interesting compositions and per-
formances from the less-is-more
school.

The Pat Metheny Group, con-
sisting of Mays, drummer Dan
Gottlieb and bassist Steve Rodby,
comes togehter on familar
Metheny terrain. Like iMetheny’s
solo effort of nearly four years ago,

“NEW .ChlaU3Ql13." "Offramp" is-._

fluid with some spirited guitar
lines, as on “James” and the medit-
ative “Are You Going With Me?"

Not unlike the “Witchita”
release, Metheny, Nanaiand Mays
mix, match and play through one
another in the haunting “Au Lait"
and the dreamy “The Bat, Part II.”
Group effort and energy is preval-
ent throughout the work, B as
“Eighteen” warms up with a near-

Caribbean rhythm and singalong —
- lyricism.

Most admirable and exciting on
the album are the title track and
“Barcarole.” “Barcarole,” a boat
song, has an earthy depth of field
that’s almost tribal.

The title track, “Offramp" races _

with an urgency and energy as wild
and driving as the free jazz of
Ornette Coleman. Not suited to
CVC.lyuup'.. taste, the cut runs like
several of the tunes from Metheny’s
double release “80/8l” that fea-
tured such veteran jazzmen as
Dewey
Haden.

Metheny’s guitar isvolatile and

furious, unafraid to stumble in its .

striving, for clarity and depty.
Improvisation has been of limited
concern to Metheny’s music in the
past. He has played music (as
opposed to jazz music) on most
‘recordings, neither fold instrumen-
talism nor highly orchestral head
trips, but a blending of the two.

If eclecticism is what Metheny’s
after, he's found it, successfully.
The promise of “Witchita” does
not fall flat. Besides pleasing some
of the people, he has kept a little
something for himself on
“Offramp.”
