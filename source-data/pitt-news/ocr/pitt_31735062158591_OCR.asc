Varsity Band Plays
For Ike In Ligonier

Only Musical Organization Invited In

Weekend Bicentennial Celebration
University of'Pittsburgh Varsity Marching Band served

v as President Eisenhower’s escort as he arrived for the Ligonier

Bicentennial last Friday afternoon. _
The Varsity Marching Band was invited by the Fort

_ Ligonier Bi-Centennial Committee headed by Richard Mellon. ‘

University Band Director, Robert Arthur, announced:

“This was an extreme honor. WeO

were the only musical organiza-
tion to be invited.”

Presideiit Arrives’

President Eisenhower, who ar-
rived at the Johnstown Airport
about 2 p.m. Friday, was driven
to Ligonier. The University Band
greeted him‘ there with “National
Emblem March” by Bagley as
they led the President's car--into
Fort Ligonier.

The band marched into place
directly below the speaker's
platform and remained there
throughout Mr. Eisenhower's
speech.

After the President had reached
the platform, the University Band
played “Hail to the Chief.” Mr.
Eisenhower then made_ his speech
which was televised and broad-
cast directly from the Fort.

The President's part of the pro-
gram ended with the National An-
them. ,

Guest of Mellons

The Varsity Marching Band
then played musical selections and
marched through simulated drills
in position for thirty minutes.

Mr. Eisenhower was a guest
of Mr. and Mrs. Mellon at'their
home after the program. The
President left Ligonier about 5
p.m. for his return ﬂight to
Washington. -

On Friday, alsoknown as Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s Day, Mellon
Park was dedicated to Ligonier
by Richard Mellon in honor of his
father, the late Richard B. Mellon.

Senator Edward Martin spoke at
the dedication.

Approximately 200,000 people
attended the _week-long event
which was opened on Monday
by Governor Leader. Elvis
Stahr, president-elect of “fest
Virginia University, and former
vice-chancellor for the profes-
sions of the University of Pitts-
burgh spoke on Tuesday.

Suggests Moving Carnival to New Asphalt Lot

Barnhart Plans University Landscaping

By PAUL FOREMAN
The appointment of Richard Barnhart as the University's
ﬁrst full-time landscape architect is in keeping with Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld’s improvement policy;
It is the job of Barnhart to oversee themaintenance of
all University grounds and to design landscape improvements
on campus. Working under Mr. Barnhart is a staff of ten

well trained groundskeepers.

Already listed as ‘Barnhart’s
achievements are the new floral
design under the Bigelow Blvd.
patio, the new path leading to
gate one at the stadium, and the
landscaping around Falk Hall,
Pennsylvania Hall and Engineer-
ing Hall.

Hedges Designate Campus

Mr. Barnhart’s big project is to
establish a relation between. the
different parts of the University
grounds. His ﬁrst move in this di-
rection was to cut all the hedges
on University property to a stand-

ard length thereby identifying all

property_ bordered by
hedges as a campus area.
He alsd plans to- develop. a
landscaping design that will be
common; around all University -_

these

     

  

buildings.‘ There is rig idesirep  .-

      

   
 
 

exactly the same, but only to de-
velop an’ easily identiﬁable sim-
ilarity in landscaping style.

The former Penn Stater would
like to have all buildings clearly
marked with signs._ In keeping
with this plan there should be
similarly designed signs placed
at strategic points showing in what
direction buildings are located.

Mark Buildings

As. Mr. Barnhart puts it,

“People come to see the great Pitt

Medical Center "but all they ﬁnd is
a conglameration of buildings
with no sufficient markings to
identify them as part of the Pitt
Medical Center."

In order to further beautify
the University .Mr.. Barnharts
plans to re-lan
the‘-building . 1'

Spark 3 Locals
To 17-0 Win

,By Larry Haggerty
Coach John Michelosen suc-
cessfully unveiled his new of-
fense to the local football fans
as the Panthers blanked the
Holy Cross Crusaders, 17-0,

_ last Saturday. .

A Stadium crowd of 49,935 saw

' the Blue and Gold score in the
. first and fourth quarters as they

registered their second straight
win. The topchdowns were tallied
by Art Gob on a ﬁve—yard pass
from Ivan Toncic and by Chuck
Reinhold on a 20-yard run. Norton
Seaman kicked a ﬁeld goal in ,be-
tween.

John Guzik started the ball
rolling for the Panthers when he
recovered a Tom Greene fumble

—..on the Holy Cross 20-yard line.

-On the first play Joe Scisly went
off tackle for 15 yards and a first
down on the ﬁve.

Three running plays failed to
gain, but on fourth down Quar-
terback Toncic passed to Gob in
the far right corner of the end
zone, for the touchdown. With
three minutes left in the quarter
Toncic added the seventh point
on a successful placement.

Late in the ﬁrst half the Cru-
saders had their only scoring
chance. A Greene pass to Bob
Deﬁne gave them-»a ﬁrst down on
the Panther eight, but an inter-
ception by Reinhold on second
down in the end zone ended the
threat. V

Gob set up the second Panther
touchdown drive late in the third
quarter when he fell on a wild
pitchout by Greene on the Holy
Cross 28-yard line.

The Blue and Gold, mainly on
the running of Fred Riddle,
picked up two consecutive first
downs to give them the ball on,
th seven. The Crusaders’ line,
however, threw Scisly for a
nine-yard loss on’ third down.
Seaman then kicked a field goal
from the 1'7 to give the Panthers
a 10-0 lead. '

Half way through the last quar-
ter, an Ed Sharockman to Curt
Plowman pass gave the Jungle
Cats the ball on the Crusader 48-
-yard line. Bob Stark broke over
left tackle to give the Panthers
the ball on the 20. ‘

Then Reinhold, on _a double re-
verse, swept right end for 20 yards
and a touchdown. Seaman place-
kicked the extra point as‘ the
‘Panthers downed their New Eng-
land rivals in the very first meet-
ing between the schools.

tion. He also hopes to develop
a park in the area behind Uni-
versity Drive depending on the
building plans of the University.
Mr. Barnhart expressed the op-
inion that a new location is need-
ed for the Spring Carnival. Spring
Carnival is a necessary part of

campus life but its present site.

is unfavorabe to the University
and the student body.
Asphalt Lot For Carnival

The University loses thousands
of dollars a year repairing dam-
age done to the front lawn. The

students also take a loss when rain.

leaves the carnival grounds in a
sea of mud. ,
It is Mr. Bai-nhart’s belief tha
this could be solved by the lay-
ing of an asphalt lot that could
double as a. parking or athletic
-- area. to be located «in. the» Schen-
ley Plaza area. Mr. Barnhart
stressed, “This is not oiﬁcial
University policy, but only my
idea."

All these plans will depend on
the success of the expansion pro-
gram and the building plans of
Chancellor Litchﬁeld and his staff.
