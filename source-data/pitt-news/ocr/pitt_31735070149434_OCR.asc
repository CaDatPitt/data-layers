Students, professors unsatisfied

Last semester, around Halloween, Pitt

Pitt Law dean speaks on

future of affirmative action

Kelan Lyons
For The Pitt News

Pitt Law School Dean William M.

‘Carter said he expects a high—proﬁle

Supreme Court precedent to be over-

turned in the near future —— a deci-

sion that would reshape the future of
admissions in academia.

Faculty, undergraduate, graduate,
Ph.D. and Law School students gath-
ered in ajam-packed room,,as well as
an overﬂow room, in the Cathedral
of Learning Wednesday afternoon
to hear the ﬁrst of the Reed Smith
2013 spring speaker series.

Carter dedicated abulk of his lec-
ture to discussingthe implications of
contemporary U.S. Supreme Court
cases on afﬁrmative action —- par-

’ ‘ticularly Fisherv. University of'I‘exas,

a case that has received national at-

‘ tention.

Despite_hisiobj,ections to consti-

 tutional arguments of aﬁ'1rmative—

action opponents, Carter said that he
envisions the Supreme Court voting

_ 5-3 in favor of striking down the prec— .
A" edent set forth in Grutterv. Bollinger.

Fisherv. University of Texas is an
ongoing case that’s being reviewed by
the Supreme Court in which Abigail
Fisher and her lawyers are askingthe
Supreme Court to declare the Univer-
sity ofTexas’ admissions policy either
inconsistent with the precedent set
forth in Grutterv. Bollinger orwholly
unconstitutional.

In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Su-
preme Court ruled that the Equal
Protection Clause of the U.S. Con-
stitution did not prohibit a univer-
sity’s “narrowly tailored use of race
in admissions decisions to ﬁirther a
compelling interest in obtaining the
educational beneﬁts that ﬂow from
a diverse student body.”

Carter said limiting or entirely

overruling the decision set forth in. A

mative action policies in institutions
of higher education in the U.S.
He added that a reversal of the

P decision could negatively impact the

number ofvoices on college campus-
es nationwide.

“Afﬁrmative action seeks diversity
on a critical mass [so universities]
have a multiplicity of viewpoints,”
Carter said.

In addition to discussing the ide-
ologies of the nine Supreme Court

justices and how that would manifest

itself during the deliberation over
Fisher v. University of Texas, Carter
spoke about constitutional theory
and underlying economic statistics
about African-Americans.

The 14th Amendment says that no
state shall deny men equal treatment
underthe law. Carter said affirmative-
action opponents contend that em-
pirical evidence demonstrates that
members of minority groups are at
equal standing with members of his-
torically advantaged groups.

But, Carter said, economic statis-
ﬁcs did not supportthe assertion. He

member of the Office of the Registrar’s class-
room management team, works to coordinate
room accommodations. Stump said that each
department in the school has one person that
works with the registrar, and they assist the
professor in room changes.

This representative must then ﬁll out a re-
quest for the professor, and the registrar then
has to see if the switch is even possible. Stump
said the Registrar’s Ofﬁce didn’ t keep a record
of professors who request to transfer out of
nationality rooms.

“During the busier classroom hours of the
day, every room on campus is booked. Thus,
making it impossible to switch some professors
from their classrooms,” Stump said.

Every nationality room except for the Syria-
Lebanon and Early American rooms, which are
closed to the public, is used daily, and Stump

went on to say that the office is as accommo— ,

dating as it possibly can be in making room
changes.

Although the nationality rooms attract many
tourists because of their elaborate decoration,
both students and professors alike do not al-

Lapekas said he has taught in many nation-

ality rooms and noted the historical brilliance

they bring to the Cathedral. He said the rooms, ’

though, may be a little too historical for cur-
rent times. g
“The nationality rooms are not technologi-
cally equipped,” he said. “I asked media services
to supply a screen, projector and speakers last
semester so that my Seminar in Composition
could watch a ﬁlm. The setup took forever, the
speakers were weak and tiny, and the picture

quality was God-awful. The whole thing was

abust.” ,

For some students, the challenges of class
in the nationality rooms goes beyond their lack
of technological capabilities.

Freshman Dan Kohan liked the antique feel
the room possessed, but he was not too crazy
about having class in the Czechoslovak room.

“I’m left—handed and all of the desks, which
are already crammed as it is, are all right—handed
desks. It’s basically impossible to spread any-
thing out onto such crammed desks,.as we ,”

is higher than whites,;th t African-Americans. T

school dropout rates are higher amongAfrican-
Americans. »

A , . Unfortunately,"Carte_r said, this groupV“§61n-
prised only one faction of aﬂirniativel action
supporters. '

Opponents of affirmative action, he said,
believe that the Constitution has an equal pro-
tection clause and that the framers of the Con-
stitution believed in colorblindness in judicial
matters so that the court would never decide a v
case on the basis of race.

Once again, Carter said that this argument
was invalid because the U.S. has an “equal pro-
tection clause, -not equal treatmen ,” adding
that “unequal starting points may require dif-
ferent kinds of protection because people are
not similarly situated.” ,

He added thatthiswillforever impact higher
educaﬁon by no longer allowing race to be one
of the factors schools use in the admissions
processes.

But Carter said that he remains hopeful for
the fixture of afﬁrmau've action. The Supreme
Court, he contended, has always been more of
“an obstacle” for members of minority groups,
rather than a beacon of hope for equality. In-
stead, Carter said he puts his faith in the demo-
cratic process, encouraging students and adults
alike to educate themselves on this issue and
vote in its favor. n

Students from many different ﬁeldsof study
at Pitt attended Carter’s speech. Juniorjustina
McMasters attended the lecture because she
knew how great of an experience it would be
to see Pitt Law’s dean speak on such a contro-
versial topic. .

McMasters noted that although “afﬁrmative
action is a subject that college suidents hear alot
about,” it is not something that she understands
extensively. ‘ -

George Stewart, a lawyer who attended the
speech as a representative of the lawﬁrm Reed
Smith, explained that the ﬁrm has sponsored the
speaker series for the past eight years because
they help spread knowledge about issues affect-
ing contemporary society.

“The talks encourage and extend discus-
sion about social issues that are important in
America,” Stewart said. I"

When the Santa myth doing more

harm than good, reconsider traditions

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

Christmas is over, but recently
I’ve been thinking a lot about
Santa'Claus. Specifically, I’ve
been thinking a_ lot about how
to tell a 20-year-old girl with spe-
cial needs, like my sister Katie,
that there is no Santa Claus, no
Easter Bunny and no Tooth Fairy.
Over winter break, my boyfriend
and I took Katie to see “Rise of

i the Guardians,” and it was an en-

joyableouting right up until the
point at which my Dad drove us
home and my sister asked him if
he believed in Santa Claus.
“Well,” he said carefully,
“there was a Saint Nicholas who
used to give us our presents.”_
“What about the Easter Bun-

ny?” she asked, and he answered
bluntly that no, the Easter Bunny
wasn’t real, to which my sister
responded by bursting into tears.

He had to believe in the Easter ,

Bunny, she. pleaded. He was be-
ing cruel. _ .

It was thus that my appre-
ciation for “Rise of the Guard-

ians” was impossibly tainted by

my growing resentment for all
stories that not only show Jack
Frost and the Tooth Fairy as real,
but depict terrible consequences
— fairies dying pathetic deaths,
Santa Claus deciding not to both-
er with Christmas this year —
brought about by kids who don’t
believe anymore. ‘What self-de-
feating propaganda. Either these
stories’ are produced by people
who don’t have children, or the

way these tales compound the
difﬁculty of explaining the truth
to kids is lost on those whose
kids aren’t sobbing, autistic
20-somethings.

In any case, one thing has be-
come increasingly obvious to me:
There must be Va-better way to‘ do
this Santa Claus thing.

Making children the subjects
of an elaborate, nationwide hoax,
supported by media that threat-
ens them with guilt and suffering
if they question it, only to sud-
denly reveal the deception when
they reach an unspeciﬁed age —
or learn of it from a friend — is
so pointlessly self-defeating that
I’m surprised child psychologists

have condoned it for so long. The .

cmmo nmtcnons:
  Embrace  own

deﬁnition of success

when thinking about  ﬁiture

d ' - Daniel Okwaisie

Columnist

Being young has never been
easy. As young people, we are
constantly trapped between not
letting our youthful exuberance
ruin our futures and not wanting
to have to say, “I should have
"enjoyed my youth more.” '

Q Being young these days is
harder than ever before. We

are bombarded on every’ side’

with waves of information al-
gg most every minute of every day.
In a fiercely competitive world,
older people, songs, books, TV
shows and even peers all think
they have the ‘best advice to
help‘ us succeed. We live under

 H a constant barrage of pressure
» _— pressure under which many
’ youngsters are sadly buckling.

So allow meto add my own dose
of pressure, because I believe I
have found the firstvrule to suc-
lcéssfor young people.

If there is one major reason
why many young people are

flailing even when given advice, '

it is only because there is too
much advice out, there, to the
extent that many well—intend—
ed pieces of advicecontradict
each other. The incongruous
advice-athon especially reaches
its peak when it comes time to
pick a major and a future career.
Some might say that getting a
liberal arts degree is not lucra-
tive enough, and only money
will ensure a blissful future.
Meanwhile, another faction
harps on about how life isn’t

about the money, andyoung
people should get degrees and; V

jobs that give them fulﬁllment;
because nothing hurts more
than being stuck in a ﬁeld you
don’t enjoy just for money.

As an example, I recently
came across an article writ-
ten by ﬁnancial adviser Rob-

ert ‘P. Murphy, who advised

young people to sell their TVs
because it is unbelievable how
much productivity they sap out
of people’s. lives. He ‘reinforced
this advice with his own per-
sonal experience about howhis

path to success was enhanced
after getting rid of his TV. That
advice, of course, contradicted

the advice that I saw earlier,
V which told young people: “Work ’

hard, but- don’t stress yourself
too much. Relax and enjoy your
TV shows and youth.” So which
is it? Should the TV be sold or
not? Because I sure as heck can-
not enjoy the TV shows if I sell
my TV \

Although they come in dif-
ferent lengths and tones, all

- success ‘stories and pieces of

advice. help clarify two charac-
teristics about success. First of
all, success is surely not a totally

objective term, and, secondly,

the path to success is(seren-
dipitous. And yes‘,‘though there

are constants to getting there,
“ a lot of successhas to do with ’

jchance.“ r : V »

While most would agree that
success is not totally objective,
the assertion that success is a
completely-subjective term is

complications we face with my sister, who
is more childlike than many people with
autism but more mature than many others,
might not be universal among special-
needs families, but I doubt it is very rare.
And the tradition doesn’t do “regular”
kids any favors, either. When I learned the
truth, I felt incredibly angry and foolish.
This was partly because I was late to catch
on —— friends of mine had told me that
none of it was real, but I hadn’t believed
them because I trusted my parents more.

And that’s what it comes down to: If
you’re a parent, or otherwise have a child
in your care, you should want that child
to trust you. Yes, it is developmentally
normal for kids to learn that their parents
aren’t always right and start seeking the
judgment of their peers instead, but that
doesn’t make it productive to intentionally
damage your credibility. And although I
don’t think most teenagers reject their
parents’ sound advice out of bitterness
over the Santa Claus lie, intentionally
making your kids feel stupid and betrayed
when you can easily avoid it just doesn’t
make sense. If you want to raise your kids
to be religious, it’s really shooting yourself
in the foot — once your 8—year—old knows
that you lied about the rabbit bringing
the Easter candy, why should he believe
you thatjesus walked on water? Is a child
sophisticated enough to understand the

difference? _

I am not suggesting we abolish Santa
Claus. I am calling for Santa Claus reform.
I believe in the value of infusing kids’ lives
with magic and the Christmas stories, hid-
den baskets of candy and treats left out
for reindeer do exactly that. But there’s
no reason we can’t give children all those
things without the lie.

I didn’t need to think “The Little Mer-
maid” was a true story to enjoy dressing
up like a princess, and there’s no reason
things like the Tooth Fairy can’t be intro-
duced to your kids as fun, special-occasion
games of make believe. You could “play”
Easter Bunny by letting them participate
in hiding baskets for their siblings or have
them dress up as reindeer or elves and
help put the presents under the tree —
and it wouldn’t have to spoil the fun any
more than knowing they aren’t actually
Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia does.

Nowadays, most people agree that
honesty is the best policy when you’re
trying to relate to kids. Major education
programs have encouraged parents to
talk honestly to their children about sex,
relationships and drug use — and “Old
Yeller” is a classic because it deals with
death in a mature and comforting way, not
because it shows the dog getting bitten by
a rabid wolf and then going on vacation.
Hopefully you can avoid my family’s cur-
rent pickle by bringing that same honesty
to the holidays. ﬂ '

motivational line when someone says,
“Success is what you say it is,” but is that
really true?

If someone

ofjob security and responsibility.

The only thing that’s clear is that
“success” is hard to deﬁne. Think about
what success means to you based on your
own values system and needs, and take
advice from your neighbors and friends
with a grain of salt. The one thing that
all success stories

works his way
up and considers
himselfto be a suc-
cess, and is then
arbitrarily fired,
would people still
consider him a
success? Certainly
most in our society
wouldn’t, because
there is a stigma
that is attached
to people who get
ﬁred. In this sense,
the idea of success
gets punted back
toward objectiv-
ity, because it
seems that one has

their field, where

and today’s pieces

everything else, if
success in life is
proving to be un-

probably because
we are doing it
wrong. I say this
knowing full well
that on the spec-

ALBUM REVIEW

Breakup Society nails complex second album with diverse sound

Sam Boj arski
S tqfj’ Wrz'ter

So Much Unhappiness,
So Little Time...

The Breakup Society

Grade: B+

Rocks Like: The Replacements

Alternative rock music means different things
for different music fans. To the fan with an
older, more classic-rock—oriented taste, it
means young high school and college-aged
kids jumping up and down while playing
power chords to the beat of an overpower-
ing drum set.

These people might never change their
minds.

But it won’t take long for someone with
an open mind to realize that The Breakup
Society is legit. Their sophomore album So
Much Unhappiness, So Little Time... pres-
ents the listener with tonal diversity from
start to ﬁnish, and a lyrical complexity one
can rarely ﬁnd in most alternative rock. The
quintet of Ed Masley (guitar, vocals), Scott
Marceau (guitar, vocals), Pat Singleton (bass),
Nick Pasco (drums, vocals) and Joe Golfen
(keyboards, vocals) fuse various inﬂuences
into a thoroughly respectable album by most
standards.

The initial and title track, “So Much Un-
happiness, So Little Time...,” is best described
as an introduction, as it is just over a minute
in length. The instrumental work is simple,
but Masley’s skill as a lyricist is immediately
recognizable. After the line, “Love is all we
needed anyway, don’t let the good times slip
away,” the song explodes into an ear-splitting
guitar riff and ends quickly.

' The upbeat introductory track leaves the
listener thinking the next song will be simpler
—— or at least a song not as strikingly slow to
develop as “Your Invitation to Quit.” Masley
and Marceau’s guitars sound like aforeboding
thunder in this song, which is painstakingly
slow, especially at the beginning.

“The Upward Spiral” seems to logically
follow from the introductory track, following
with a more similar sound, but, nevertheless,
is track number three. This song exhibits

. a country inﬂuence, carried by an acoustic

guitar. It isn’t quite as driving as the precede
ing two tracks, but manages to inspire some
energy in the listener. The electric guitar work
— which ends up eventually overpowering
the acoustic — on this song is exceptional,
as is the high vocal arrangement.

“Another Day in the Life” is a lighthearted,

piano-heavy tune that is evidently inspired
by The Beatles. The keyboard even sounds
similar to the Beatles’ “A Day in the Life’? at
many points. This tune, along with “He’s Sup-
portin’ the War” are the ﬁrst two songs that
Masley has ever written on piano. V
“Here Comes Floyd” has that power-

PROFILE

Hope McLaughlin
jStaff Wrz'ter

A small group of Pittsburgh residents bore
witness to the collaborative efforts of four
up-and-coming musicians when Motive
made a stop at.Garﬁ.eld Artworks last Fri-
day. The Brooklyn-based rockers took the
stage in front of no more than 20 people,
but the size or the crowd at the show was
no testament to the band’s talent.

Lead vocalist Nick Wold, bassist An-
drew McGovern, guitarist David Leondi
and drummer Chris Bagamery have been
playing together aslthe band Motive for
about two years in Brooklyn. Though their
individual tastes in music differ rather dis-
tinctly from pne another, the music they
produce together reﬂects their shared

appreciation of Radiohead, Nirvana, The
Strokes and ’9os grunge, in general.

“We feel like those bands carried the
torch for rock ‘n’ roll after the Beatles era,”
Wold said. “We want to- be ‘a part of that
music—making process.” '

Indeed, Motive’s dirty rock has a de-
ﬁnitive post—’90s grunge ﬂavor. Onstage
at Garﬁeld Artworks, Wold, McGovern,
Leondi and Bagamery donned their sig-
nature skinny ties and suits. I

They brought their catchy hooks and

_ chord progressions to life with infectious

energy. Motive kept the audience members
tapping their feet —- even dancing for a
while —— and made the trek through the
snow to the concert worthwhile. Both the
band and the audience left the venue mutu-
ally appreciative of the shared experience.

Though Friday’s snowstorm may have

limited Motive’s live audience in Pittsburgh,
the band is getting plenty of recognition
elsewhere. Motive is undeniably becoming
a prominent part of the indie music scene
in Brooklyn and across the country.

Last March, the professionally produced
music video for Motive’s song “What’s So
Bad” premiered on MTV2’s “12o Minutes”
show. The band was interviewed on the
show, as well. Seven months later, the boys
added another song to the MTV, rotation
and returned for_a second appearance on
“12O Minutes” when their music video for
“It’s Illicit” premiered on both MTVU and
MTV2.

“It was very surreal watching our video

come on TV right between The Black Keys .

and Skrillex,-” Bagamery said. “We never
thought we were going to be here.”
His bandmates agreed. Wold, McGovern

Motive brings Brooklyn rock sound to Pittsburgh venue

and Bagamery are originally from Seattle,
and have been playing music together for
10 years since their youth jazz band days.

They met Leondi, who also grew up playing“

in jazz bands, when they all moved to the
East Coast for college, and Leondi and Wold
were -randomly paired roommates at New
York University. The band now resides in
Bushwick, ‘one of Brooklyn’s well-known
art hubs, where they currently are working
on their ﬁrst album. .. -

Motive has also received accolades from
several different publications and news
sources. Metro New York mentioned Mo-
tive as one of College MusicJournal’s bands
to watch, dubbing Motive “The Strokes
2.0.” Additionally, the band has recently

been featured in TWELV magazine, Per-

Phil Lynott ideal frontman
with onstage swagger

.Vince Smith
WPTS Contributor

There is an aphorism in the world of rock ‘n’

roll that states if you have a good frontman,
you have a better chance of making the big
time. He or she has to be marketable, smooth

and possess an aura that demonstrates bra- ‘

vado.
A good front man is always the topic of con-

. versation and becomes the face. of eyeryghing ._
the band puts out. Sufﬁce it to say, tlibiigh,”
‘they are few and far between. ' ’ ’ ' -

Jan. 4, 2013, marked the 27th Valrlniversaiy
of the death of one of music’s most Vcharisriiatici

lead singers',1PhiloLynott —— the  of
the Irish hard rock band Thin Lizzy. Lynott“.

Virnpfortantly, he was conﬁdent and knew that
_ "Igéveryone in the room was looking at him.

- _.   yﬂ Unlike many other lead singers of the ’70s,

I ’  played’b.ass guitar. What might inhibit

- the stage presence of some did» not have any

adverse effects on Lynott. He wore his bass
up high, coupled with a studded guitar strap,
and played each chord as if it came from inside
him.-:_.H[e would strum the notes, cofmiulsing

,.pwér   hellacious Qrﬁythm,
»   .   reared such as “Dancing in;
the Moonli”gh't,”"and”“Bad Reputatidﬁl” In in‘-

    

   

strumental breaks, he would be seen crouch- 5

ing as he held his bass like a machine gun,
systematically “shooting” his fans, who. gladly
accepted the strafe. , - _
For a band that was pushing the envelope
on how loud and fast music could be, Lynott
had a soothing effect on the band’s music —
the antithesis of a rough—voiced rocker. He
was smooth, sultry and incomparably sexy,
giving Thin Lizzy its hard, yet sensibly poppy
feel. In live performances, he wouldextend
notes, showcasing his Irish lilt, and at times

‘leave the microphone stand entirely,‘ as if to

say, “You know what comes next.” - ‘ I

His lyrical content was simple, yet elegant,

and he could be both heartfelt and macho.’

In the power ballad “Still in Love with You,”
Lynott sang of the pains of unrequited love,
which subsequently humanized the “king of
masculinity,” who at times seemed untouch-
able. 7

He did not remain crushed for long when
he pumped out lines like, “If that chick don’t
want to know, forget her,” in the “The Boys Are
Back in Town;” a simple turn of phrase with
an ambiguous connotation, commanding all
of us to not waste our time on people who do
not realize how awesome we truly are.

For the rest of the band, ‘playing behind
Lynott could not have been easy. He received
all the attention. He was the leader of the band
and probably garnered the most — if not all
— of the praise. I

At the end of the day, a good frontm
can make a band, but for the other members,
it is a curse just as much as a blessing. Thin

‘ Lizzy drummer Brian Downey was able to

play in front of thousands of adoring fans,
but he knew full well that they were cheering
mostly for Lynott. The crowd would hang on

' Lynott’s every word, and even the occasional

drum solo was not nearlyenough to divert
their attention. ' '

Sadly, like many musicians of his era,

Lynott was a slave to the hedonism of his
generation. This led to his early demise. The
world only got 36 short years out of the thin-
mustachioed Irishman, who taught us all how

to be cool, but reminded us that we probably -

could never be that cool. V

Although many may deem a strong front-
man as a tad anachronistic and not completely
necessary for modem—day musical success, I

counter that with my belief that Lynott would A

have thrived anywhere and at any time. His
voice, swagger and musical prowess are per-
petual and unrivaled.

The band tours without their iconic front-
man nowadays, hoping to capture a semblance
of the good times that were had during its
glory days. Although the members continue
on, they know full well that they will never
be the same without Lynott leading the way.

MOTIVE

former magazine and on CBS News. They
recently received conﬁrmation that they
will be playing at the South by Southwest
festival in Austin, Texas, this March. I
When asked the meaning behind their
band name, the band members agreed that
after playing under countless titles,-, Motive
was the name that they all hated the least.
“Motive is a reason to move, a reason
to do something,” Wold said. “Music is our

motive — it gives us our energy.”
Reflecting on video making and other
experiences, Bagamery continued in that
vein. A
“The more energy and commitment that
we put into projects, the better they come
out. That’s kind of the same reason we wear
suits —— we want to really make an effort.
We want people to feel like they’re getting
something out of seeing us,” he said.

Motive’s “It’s Illicit” EP premiered on A

The Wild Honey Pie onjan. 16 and is avail-
able for free download. I

chord-heavy, garage-band feel that seasoned
rock ‘n’ roll fans typically attribute to alterna-
tive rock. This is one of those songs that may
remind you of the stuff you played with your
old band in high school. Now, you and your
friends look back on those days and say, “Gee,
we weren’t that ‘good. But man, did we have
fun.” This track captures part of that garage-
band nostalgia. . ’
“8th Circle of Hell” has a pretty deep
theme as represented by its title. However,

the distortion-heavy power chords that come _

in halfway through this song have a certain
way of detracting from the theme. Either that,

or the song starts off in too light a fashion.‘ But ’

in any case, the band should be more decisive
about how they want their songs to sound. It
might be beneﬁcial to eliminate some of those
sounds that just count as noise.

The ninth track is :1 waltz called “Mary
Shelley.” This might be Masley’s most heartfelt
vocal effort on the album. ‘Although Masley’s
singing and songwriting is brilliant, the in-
strumentation lacks, and doesn’t fully develop.
The band deﬁnitely could have exploredthe

more ominous sound with which it had started a

on thealbum. T , T » -

' Thealbum ends with “(She’s) Waiting for
the Bubble _.to Burst” and “She Doesn’t Cross
Against the Light.” The ﬁrst of these tracks is
catchy, but short, and doesn’t contain many
highlights unlike the rest of the album. But the
last track on the album is one of the biggest

I — head bangers. Such a rebellious, rockin’ song

by all rights is of course about a rebel chick.

. So Much Happiness, So Little Time... is a
great second effort from a talented band on
the rise. At times it is a bit heavy on the guitar
or the drums in the wrong places, but it was
still a good‘ depiction of the band’s’ across-the-
board talent..If nothing else, Masley may be
the poet laureate of alt rock. 5 . . A —

January 81 , 2018 l The Pitt News 1 \/Mm./.pittoewsoom

    SPORTS

» Nate Barnes
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Jamie Dixon is trying to do something this
season that many would likely expect to

. wash out as a fruitless endeavor. As Pitt

men’s basketball fans know, Coach Dixon
usually utilizes a rare 10—player rotation
in each game.
But his rotation isn’t the crazy part.
Rather, what’s surprising considering
Dixon’s history of not playing new faces

as much as the veteran players is that four

of the 10 players in Pitt’s current rotation

JoHNsoN

have never played for the Panthers before
this season.

The four new players — freshman center
Steven Adams, freshman point guardjames
Robinson, junior guard Trey Zeigler and
redshirt freshman forward Durandjohnson
—— currently combine to play an average of

79 minutes per game, with both Adams and ..

Robinson having stepped into the starting
lineup since the beginning of the season.

This after none of those players played
a single minute for Pitt last season.

Now, 21 games into the season, Pitt fans »

can ask, “How is this unfamiliar strategy
working out?”

Here’s a look at each new player and
how his contributions have been shaping
the team’s season.

James Robinson: 27.5 minutes, 6.6
points and 3.9 assists per game ’:7

Robinson’s production may not be the
most impressive of all the freshmen com-
ing into the NCAA ranks, but his transition
into Pitt’s basketball program has been as
seamless as it gets. For a freshman point
guard, Dixon lauds his ability to make the
right play at the right time and to be a leader
on the ﬂoor. ’ .

“I go through practice and schemes, jot-

ting down mistakes and watching the ﬁlm
for things we need to improve on for each
guy, individually.-There’s this little box,
and every time I look at it, there’s James’,
and it’s empty. It’s just very few mental».
mistakes,” Dixon said after a recent game.
“There are just no mental mistakes, and
that’s’so valuable.” -
In addition, Robinson continues to
gain recognition for his defensive ability,
teaming with redshirt sophomore guard
Cameron Wright on most nights to guard“
the opposition’s best perimeter scorer. Of-

GABLER STYLE

Fans will still sup

r eri 1'   baseb

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

It’s easier to ask for forgiveness than for per- .

mission. '
New York Yankees third baseman Alex Ro-

driguez certainly took advantage of this old

adage when he made his public apology in Feb-
ruary 2009 for using performance enhancing
drugs.

Many baseball fans were pulling for himto A

break Barry Bonds’ career home-run record,

which they felt was taintedafter speculation '

that Bonds used PEDs.

Even more Yankees fans supported him af- V
ter his apology; it’s easy to pull for a guy only a A
year removed frombeing named the American '

League MVP. He hit only 35 home runsthe previ-
ous year, and the fact thatl say “only” shows just
how good he had been for New York.

On Tuesday, the Miami NewTimes published
a lengthy article about a Miami anti-aging clinic
named Biogenesis, which provided steroids to
Major League Baseball stars. Rodriguezwas
the most notable name on the list, but he was
joined by Nationals pitcher Gio Gonzalez, Giants
outﬁelder Melky Cabrera, A’s pitcher Bartolo
Colon, and Rangers outﬁelder Nelson Cruz.

Yankees fans have changed their tune this
time around by callingforthe team to ﬁnd away
to void the aging superstar’s contract, which has
ﬁve years and atotal of $114 million remaining.

Don’t start  that the fans are taking
the high road. Rodriguez, while still posting
quality seasons, has seen his statistics drop
drastically for the past two seasons.

He has missed 103 games in two seasons due
to injury, despite having alseven-year stretch

. during which he missed just 20 games total.

In 2011, he failed to hit 20 home runs for the
ﬁrst time since 1995, a season inwhich he only

port A-Rod,

  
   

Alex Rodriguez aave battcl for telastime as a New ark Yanlee. MCT Campus.

played 48 games.

‘It’s no wonder Yankees fans want their team
to rid itselfof the three—time American League
MVP. -

And the Yankees are listening. According r

to ESPN, the team is searchinghis contract for

aboutzo different clauses that could allow them _

to void it. _

It’s unlikely, though, that Rodriguezwillplay
anywhere but NewYork forhisﬁnal years, as the
League has been adamant in avoiding language
that would allow teams to void contracts for
veteran players.

There’s still alot to be ﬁgured out inthis case,
and I suppose it is American to see A-Rod as in-
nocent until proven guilty. But when you’ve been
proven guilty for the same charge before, you’ll
have to do a lot to validate yourselfto the public.

Rodriguez and his representatives released
a statement denying the allegations outright.

“The news report about a purported rela-
tionship between Alex Rodriguez and [Bio-
genesis owner] Anthony Bosch are not true,”
Rodriguez’s spokesman said. “Alex Rodriguez
was not Mr. Bosch’s patient, he was never treated
by him and he was never advised by him. The
purported documents referenced inthe story——
at least as they relate to Alex Rodriguez — are
not legitimate.” *

— However, he’s already been found guilty in
the court of public opinion. That alonewill cause
him to get plenty ofboos from both away crowds
and the Bronx spectators.

Something tells me that the New York boos
will go away ifhe is able to put together an A-Rod
season of old despite his injuries.

Just as Pirates fans will complain about the
team’s owners’ stinginess while still attend-
ing games and adding money to the coffers,
Yankees fans will don their No. 13 jerseys and
cheer Rodriguez. That’s just the hypocrisy that
is baseball. I

NEW FACES

fensively, Robinson possesses one of the
nation’s best assist—to-turnover ratios with
3.4 assists for every turnover committed
— playing a key role in Pitt’s development

est team interms of

7, l, - ._‘j,‘Desp'ite"solid numbers in  ‘regards,
:_.’:Robinsoi1_’s.play.lwill'4r.arely show up in ab ox

i7:S'éoi*je, as seniorpoint guard Tray'Woodall

 ?_has learned about his freshman teammate.
 :‘5We’ve been saying it all year: What he

iﬁdoes never shows up in the box score,”
’f.;Woodall said. f‘His_ points aren’t an indi-

1:

if cation (of how wellhe played. He plays ex-
"j-tremely. hard, ‘defends the best player on

the court, night-in and night-out.”

1 ‘ "Steven A_damls:'f22..8'minutes, 6.8

points, 6.3 rebounds and two blocks
per game
‘For all the hype Adams accrued inthe
years preceding his arrival at Pitt, it would
seem to some that he might havebeen
slightly disappointing in his rookiefyear
at the collegiate level. V 1‘
1 But in reality, he’s been one of the con-
ference’s best big men this year based on
his numbers. His 59.1 shooting percentage

A ranks just behind Notre Dame’s Jack Cooley

for the conference’s best rate, and Adams
ranks fourth in the conference with his

‘blocks-per—game average. The freshman \

— from New Zealand also leads the Panthers

in rebounding.

The best part about Adams, however, is
that he seems to improve with each game.
Against Providence last week, Adams start-
edvthe game with a hook shot and followed
it with a 3-point play. _

But as Pitt fans have seen too many time
already, Adams soon walked to the bench
in foul trouble.

As he continues to learn to play without
fouling, his numbers should increase‘.

“[Steve’s] working hard, and we’re con-
tinuing to get the ball inside to him more,’-’,
Dixon said after Adams’ nine-point, 14-re-
bound, three—block performance last Sat-
urday against DePaul. “He’s a new guy, he’s
a freshman and probably no guy is having
more of an adjustment going from where
he came from to playing in the Big East.

' There’s no other way to look at it. There’s

no guy making as big of a transition as him.
But again, [I’m] envisioning and hoping that
he is going to show signs of improvement,
and I think he has.” 0

Trey Zeigler: 16.5 minutes, six points,
two rebounds and 1.1 assists per game

Off the bench, Zeigler seemed to struggle
early in his Pitt career. In nonconference
play, Zeigler was relatively unheard of, ex-
cept for scoring 10 points in 20 minutes off
the bench in Pitt’s1regular-season opener
against Mount'St. Mary’s.

But with half of the season over, it ap-
pears Zeigler has ﬁnally found his niche in
the Pitt program after transferring from

Central Michigan, where he was the focus
ofthe offense the last twoseasons. At Pitt,
Zeigler is no longer a primary option, but
one of many, and he is now seeing more
time on the ﬂoor.

With the additional playing time, Zeigler
rewarded Di'xon’s trust greatly, as evidenced

most clearly with the 13 points the junior ~

guard scored off the bench against Villanova
to help jump start a four—game winning
stﬁieak for the Panthers. On Saturday, Zei-
glegr ﬁnished with 18 points against DePaul.

if-He believes that the recent improve-
ment in his play, which'coincides‘with Pitt’s
recent success, stems from increasing fa-
miliarity with the team’s offense. .

:‘fI‘he last couple of weeks, I’ve found
myself in the offense, and I’m doing what

 

 

Coach [Dixon] wants me to do,” Zeigler
said. “It’s helped me play more. Being out
there, I’ve been able to ﬁnd my groove and
just be myself a little bit more.”

Durandjohnsonz 12 minutes and 4.3
points per game

Johnson, a versatile redshirt freshman,
was an unknown commodity entering the
season. The most anyone really knew about
him was that he shot a lot in the Pittsburgh
Basketball Club league over the summer.

Now,Johnson has become another cru-
cial player in Pitt’s 10-man rotation, bring-
ing a spark to the Panthers when he steps
on the ﬂoor. With his smooth 3-point stroke
and 36.4 shooting percentage from beyond
the arc, Johnson can instantly provide of-

rs 

fense off the bench. He demonstrated this

capability in the Panthers’ games against
Marquette and Villanova, in whichjohnson
put up 10 and 13 points, respectively.

Johnson has also shown commitment
to improving his defense and rebound-
ing, necessary traits to have in order tb
see time on the court with Dixon leading
the Panthers.

The athletic 6-foot-6 redshirt freshman
knows he needs to bring as much enthusi-
asm to the defensive side of his game as he

does to the offensive side. 

“I feel like my role is to be the energy
guy, to come in and play defense, and that’s
what I do,” Johnson said. “When I get in
there, I just play defense and do whatever
I gotta do to help my team win.” I
