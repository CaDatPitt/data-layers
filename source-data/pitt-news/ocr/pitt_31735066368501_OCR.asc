Fliseln Admissions Applications

A by ANN oicoi~iN6”R

Despite the recent upswing in the
enrollmentfigures, College "of Arts
and Sciences’ dean Irwin Schulman

' said it is still too early to determine if

it’s a trend.

He.also said that the increase in

applications will not necessarily
trigger a more selective admissions
policy. _ ‘

Presently, the inﬂux of applica-
tions coming into Pitt is slowing
down, and Schulman said that the
university will “informally aim for a
10 percent increase in the size of its
freshman class.” * ’

There are some disadvantages to
the increase in enrollment, however.
For example, the basic writing and
composition courses usually have a

class size of 20 students. If Pitt were '

to admit 10 percent more freshman,
20 extra places in each of those
courses would be necessary.

Also, the need for additional
classes would characterize computer
science, calculus and other courses
that require a minimal class size
because of the difficulty of the sub-
ject. Schulman said that the recita-
tions of large classes_ would be
similarly affected. '

Schulman said the objective of the
administra_tion would probably be
one of holding down class sizes to
insure a decent education for the stu-
dent as opposed to striving for a “l0
percent better class.”

Ke/vin Altomari, the assistant

director of admissions, said Pitt is
“running ahead in students who
have committed themselves to the
university.” He said he does not
know if any problems will result.

Altomari described the enroll-
ment increase as a double-edged
sword. One one hand, Pitt would
receive an increase in revenues; on
the other, faculty would experience
the burden of larger number of stu-
dents in the classroom.

He said the philosophical aspect

of the increasing applications must ,

decide if the cost‘of educating the
students reﬂects the cost to" the uni-
versity in terms of tuition and fees.”
Altomari said the expected tuition
of an incoming student. will be
$2,210 and if the student received
financial aid, the university would
also have to consider the factor of
“fund displacement.”

Both Altomari and Schulman
said it was too early to specify partic-
ular policy parameters in response

The Student Government
Board started reviewing the
budgets of student organizations
and also heard the budget
requests from its standing com-
mittees last week.

The SGB’s budget request was
for $58,437. The Allocations
Committee recommended that
$46,783 be approved, that $4,025
be held in escrow, that $968 be
deferred and $6,661 be denied.

Board member Kathy Brown
said, “I am very pleased withthe
allocations’ recommendation.”
Brown said that the only prob-
lem she had with the budget was
that the money for office decora-
tions was cut. Brown said, “To
exemplify a professional attitude
and atmosphere, I think we need
decorations in the office.”

Allocations chairperson

tions, but I.thirik decorations
from home could be used.”

The SGB budget was passed
6-1, with Brown casting the dis-
senting vote.

Some of the expenditures in
the SGB budget are $333 for an
activities fair, $4,600 for home-
coming activities, $2,293 for the
orientation. conference, $2,792

Schulman said a factor such as an
“aggressive and effective admissions
office” might stimulate students to
apply to Pitt.

Schulman said that students who
apply now will have a better chance
of being admitted than those apply-
ing in. July and August. After that,
only the exceptionally qualified stu-
dent will be admitted, he said.

The ‘SGB rejected the budget
requests of the Student Relations

were rejected because both had
requested a 35 mm camera in
their budgets. Kathy Brown sug-

These budgest will now go back
to the Allocations Committee

5 Percent
Tuition  
Hike
Expected,

By BRIAN BALK

Pitt students will have to dig
further down in their pockets next
year because, according to Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar, they are soon to

be hit with a 5 percent tuition.

increase.
The increase will boost tuition

rates from $2,210 to $2,320 (an

increase of $110) for the in-state
student.

In Saturday’s meeting with the
Pennsylvania House Appropria-
tions Committee, Posyar requested
$86 million in state aid for Pitt. This

was a 10 percent increase for the..

1984 fiscal year.

Governor Richard Thornburgh,
however, only recommended, a 2
percent increase in his budget pro-
posal submitted last month.

Originally, Pitt requested a $13
million, increase in state
appropriations.

Even if Pitt's request is fully

granted, Posvar said that a 5 percent ‘

increase is inevitable. And if the
state appropriations do not reach
therequested level, an even greater
burden will Be placed on students._

Pitt students are presently paying ‘

$240 more in tuition fees than the
did__in 1982. -

According. to Posvar, tuition
increases have become a way of life
for college students.

If Pitt’s 10 percent increase were
granted, it would only account for
one-third of the 1984 fiscal budget,
presently seteat $290 million. '

Allocations Committee recom-
mended that it receive $7,153.26
and that $415 be deferred. The
main expenditure in its budget is
$6440 for the publication of the
course evaluation booklet.

The Elections Committee
requested $8,015. The Alloca-
tions Committee recommended
that $2782 be approved, that
$2250 be held in escrow and that

expenditures of the Elections
Committee are $840 for payment
of poll workers during the SGB
elections and $3175 for the SGB
inaugural dinner.

The Governmental Relations
Committee requested $12,106. It
was granted $9,246. The main
expenditures of the committee
are $3474 for eight lobbying trips _ ‘
to Harrisburg, $1890 for a three-
day lobbying trip to Washing-
ton, D.C., and $618 for local
lobbying. ’ __

In other business, ex-board ,
member Chip Roth presented a
proposal to the SGB on behalf of
Professor Theodore Windt.
Windt's proposal is for a sympo-
sium to be held at Pitt. The sym-—
posium, tentatively titled
“Campaign I984,” is scheduled
for October of next year. The
total cost of the four-day sympo-
sium is $53,000. According -to

Roth, .Windt is presenting the

Board. Each of these groups is
being asked to fund a percentage
of the symposium. _V . .
According to Roth, Windt is

A asking_the SGB for $10,000. The

money will be used to bring CBS
News correspondent Bill Moyers
and syndicated columnist
George Will. Other speakers
scheduled to appear are Lane
Kirkland, president of AFL-
CIO, William Safire, , former
g of President
Richard Nixon, and Jody
Powell, former press secretary to '

.. President Jimmy Carter.

“I know $10,000 is a lot of
money-, but I think if you look at.
the program, it is very well put
together and a lot of prestigious
people will be attending,” Roth
said.

The symposium will consist of
a series of panel discussions,
workshops and seminars.
According to Roth, if a student
wanted to attend a panel discus-
sion or a workshop, the cost
would be $25. Roth said, “Of
course, any speaker who was
funded by the SGB would be
open to the university commun-
ity free of charge.” ’

Roth said he was not asking
the board for a vote, he just
wanted the board to know what

By Peggy Ferri

Beginning a magazine takes more
than money and energetic promo-
tion campaigns—it takes new ideas.
And new ideas are what magazine
editor Jonathan Brent said charac-
terize Formations, his new literary
magazine. -

Formations is unique in that it
will address itself to the fusing
together of ideas from varied disci-
plines, according to Brent. He said
he plans to publish the works of for-
eign writers in addition ‘to essays
which deal with interdisciplinary,
cultural and artistic commentary of
an international scope.

Brent will be one of the guests at ..

the Seventh Annual University of
Pittsburgh Writers’ Conference, to
be held on March 19 and 20. The
former editor of TriQuarterIy Mag-
azine and editor of the Best of Tri-
Quarterly will introduce the Pitt

‘audience to small presses and draw

from his experiences to put that
world into perspective. As a result of
his work on Formations, he will also
be able to speak about the future of
literary magazines.

“People who write know very lit-
tle about what is happening in the
other arts,” Brent explained. “Wri-
ters are mostly at universities and
writing to get tenure as a require-
ment of their position. This isola-
tionism is one of the defining
qualities of the literary situation,
and noticing this is oneof the rea-
sons I wanted to start this
magazine.”

For assistance with this task, he

will draw from the knowledge and

Brent said it is through these peo-
ple that he hopes to establish contact
within the American community as
well as abroad. It is because Brent
wants Formations to be more than a
local magazine that he faces some
problems—problems common to
every literary endeavor.

One problem is accumulating the
funds to pay the honorarium that
good fiction demands, according to

Brent. Honoraria range between

lem, however, is always promotion.

“First you have‘to start with the
realization that nobody needs you

explained. “To get established,
therefore, you have to purchase lists
from other periodicals and do direct
mailings.

‘:1 regard this promotion as the
most painful of all because it is so
totally unproductive,” he added.
“You have to pay ‘a fortune for it
all—and for what!”

which tries to enter the scene and
claim a part of the market.

Brent said he wants his magazine
to count. And to count, he
explained, people have to pay atten-
tion to it. -

“I would be happy if 3,000 people

were to read; all literary magazines
have a small, select readership,"
Brent said.

Formations will appear three

times annually, according to Brent,
and after the first few issues have
been published, he will channel his
efforts into soliciting the work of
new, talented writers.

“In every issue, Formations will
approach a topic from a variety of

w *- I I —Page.3i‘

I

I

different disciplines," Brent
explained._ He added that this means

publishing views on the subject from _,
areas such as visual arts, music, ‘

theater and literature, in combina-
tion with viewpoints from politics
and philosophy. - 
Formations will be a success if it
succeeds in being a catalyst to dis-
cussion, according to Brent. The

magazine, he said, will not be work-_

ing in a vacuum. V .
“Artists in the university institu-

tion environment can become com- ’

placent, and this is what I find
upsetting,” Brent said. “I think it

leads to a predisposition not to_

examine one’s own life.

“It also upsets me because it dem-
onstrates a kind of moral laziness,”
he explained. “It is repulsive because

people‘ then accept their world with- I

out curiosity.”

Brent associates this laziness with
that bred into the middle class (the
class in which Brent grew up); the
desire not to make choices——the
inability to formulate a point of
view, according to Brent.

‘‘I guess that this is xthereason I
feel a connection between the arts
and the way in which we live our
lives,” Brent said, “and I have no
desire, therefore, to center exclu-
sively on literary, subjects in this
magazine.” ' '

Brent said he has a lot of faith in
his ‘magazine for a couple of reasons.

“There is no other magazine like .

it—there is no other magazine that is
going to, be doing what I will be
doing,” he said. “The magazine has a
guiding idea rather
randomnessrand this will help it

- catch on.” ‘ .

The
 Home
Front‘

Problems at home are mounting as Pitt’s Student
Government Board (SGB) continues its 1983 road
trip. '

The board has chartered a bus to carry Pitt students
to the National Student Action Day rally today in
Washington, D.C., where legislators are busy consid-
ering the federal budget for ﬁscal 1984.

The Governmental Relations Committee (GRC), an
arm of SGB, will close its most active. week of lobbying
in Harrisburg to join Pitt’s roving politicians for their
" - Washington appearance.

While these lobbying trips are justifiable as attempts
to focus student attention on state and national legisla-
tors as next year’s‘ budgets are being developed, they
have left the‘ homefront open to attacks from Pitt’s
own administration.

Since the current board took office in January, the
administration has announced several decisions that ,
will directly affect students, including a proposed tui-
tion hike, faculty cutbacks and, most recent_ly,ithe
closing of Pitt’s Internship Office. Since these deci-
sions came on the heels of Governor Thornburgh’s
proposal to increase Pitt’s annual appropriation by
only 1.9 percent, it is logical for students to turn to
Harrisburg to voice their reactions. _

But students would do well to make some ‘noise at
home before hitting the road. The administration’s
response to Thornburgh’s budget signalled that, when
faced with budget restrictions, programs that beneﬁt
students will be the first to go. Meanwhile, university
foundations and corporations are being created to

' protect Pitt’s research endeavors and the Faculty of

Arts and Sciences assures the public that research
positions will not be cut when anticipatedreductions
in the faculty are made. A I

So far, SGB has responded to these moves with
silence. Students must conclude that this lack of
response is the result of oversight and not inability to
act. With its .visibility on campus, SGB could organize
rallies here calling for protection of student interests so
that, if the Harrisburg and Washington efforts prove
unsuccessful, the burden of government cuts can be
borne more equitably throughout the university. I

There is important work tov'be done right here.
Won't you come home? i

Letters To I The

Crude And Tragic Errors

Dear Editor:

The article, “Everything to Gain
by Peace” by Zachary Grayson (Then

‘ Pitt News, Feb. 14) made several

“derogatory accusations in response
to my letter, “The Exact Opposite is
True” (Feb. 4).’--

I resent the flagrant humiliation
that Mr. Grayson affords me with
his charges that I am an anti-Semite.

. This is a tragic interpretation of my

disposition, and I am sorry for such
a state of affairs.

Grayson entraps me in a tyranny
of subjective reality which suffocates
the emergence of freedom and truth.
He presents select segments out of
the context of what I wrote in order

Alcohol

Dear Editor.

K.- Strauss in “Pittsburgh's
Second Largest Jail" (Jan. 17)
unreasonably and prematurely pro-
claims the proposed moratorium on
campus parties as an unfair move by
the administration. Perhaps Strauss
should give the idea a fair chance
and consider that the university is

. simply being responsible for the stu-

dents who live on its campuses.
The administration may have

formed ‘alcohol committee by plac-
ing the moratorium. , When ‘Strauss
jumps ‘to the conclusion that .this

. mo.ratorium_was proposed solely as

a result of the death of the football

player Todd Becker, he should think A
"back to some of the parties where

unruly incidents have resulted in the
injury of many innocent students.
Far too many of these incidents,
some them fatal, have occurred on
the campus because of the lack‘of
necessary regulations. Many stu-
dents under the influence of alcohol
have thrown such annoying items as
water or more dangerous items such
as beer bottles and desks out of the

windows of ‘the Schenley Quads

dorms. ’

. For Strauss to pick the 24-hour '
security‘ system to. attack. is.a

mean that all Catholics are terror-
ists? Of course not! Calling me an
anti-Semite and a Jew—hater is a
crude error committed by a man in
desperation. I know Jews who agree
with the views expressed in my let-
ters to The Pitt News.

Grayson says that the future of the
West Bank should be negotiated by
all concerned parties. But we are
expected to agree that it is perfectly
all right for Israel to build settle-

ments on the West Bank in spite of’

the uncertainty of its sovereignty.
‘Grayson ' points to the Camp

David peace accords as a positive

step in the cause of peace, yet I say it

is-a myth and can only bring war in '

the future. Israel’s “peace” with
Egypt acts to split and embitter the
Arab people as a whole and lead to
the demise of the Palestinians while
giving‘a shot in the arm to the pro-
Western Iraq-Jordan-Saudi axis of
Arab ‘states. Is this how Grayson
means “Israel is the only thing which
can unite the Arabs?”

Grayson stresses that Israel has

“been continuously calling for
peace.” That kind of “peace” can
only be obtained by Arab states’
(like Lebanon or Syria) appeasing
Israel and_muting their demands.
To the charge that Arab states

_ attacked Israel, I see this to be to the

contrary. In 1948, Israel was barely
even a country. Jews living in what
had been Palestine numbered only
15 percent or so of the Arab popula-
tion. British control of immigration
collapsed with Jews’ coming to

Israel by the thousands. Israel

represented a volatile threat by
launching attacks on many Arab vil-
lages resulting in retaliation from
nearby Arab. countries. Israel
emerged from these and subsequent

confrontations with‘ expanded,‘

borders. Grayson said, “Not a single
Arab nation has even recognized her
[Israel's] existence at any boundary
lines.” May it be asked, where are
the boundary lines?

The Pitt News, Monday March 7, 1983“

Dear Editor:

About a fortnight ago, well-meaning Nig-
erians and friends alike were taken aback by
a publication in The Pitt News (Feb. 2) in
which very sweeping, unsavory and villify-
ing statements were credited to three indi-
viduals: Ms. R. Boudaud and Messrs. T.
C_hieke and R. Morrison.

 In spite of the tremendous amount of urge
to “return fire for fire,” the leadership and

" entire membership of the Nigerian Students’ I

Union in Pittsburgh acted with maturity cul-
minating in the formation of a five-man
committee which would obtain evidence to
substantiate the above-mentioned asser-
tions. After careful investigation, the follow-
ing was found with respect to the comments
of each individual.

Mr. T. Chieke had no concrete evidence to
prove that the officials at the Nigerian
Embassy are incompetent. He could not dif-
ferentiate between bureaucracy (which is
inevitable in any civil service set-up) and
incompetence.

He could not submit the names of those he
purportedly sheltered. On the contrary, evi-
dence showed that any Nigerians under the
same roof with him’ were responsible for

~ their own part of the rent. Of course, if

Chieke had been in the same predictament as
he made us believe, -how could he care for the
“non-existing”. students? Like the proverbial
saying, “The blind leading the blind.”

In conclusion, Mr. Chieke’s comments
did not reflect the union’s views (even
though he apologized after protesting that
he was misquoted in certain areas by the
press), and accordingly, he has been relieved
of his post as the secretary of the union.

Ms. R. Boudaud, when confronted, was
not able to furnish us with any evidence to
back up her assertions. She clearly stated
that her remarks about the Central Bank
and the nation’s economic state were based
on conversations between her and students
as well as embassy officials.

When requested to provide details about
the unpaid rent and medical bills and stu-

. dents who can no longer feed themselves, she

couldn’t. As evidenced from the foregoing, it
can be deduced that Ms. Boudaud’s sources
of information do not constitute solid
grounds on which an officer whose functions
are more or less “mini-ambassadorial” in
nature should run to the press and “pour out
her heart.”

Because we viewed the comments of the
director of OIS as being much more weighty,
we_communicated to him in writing request-
ing him to provide us with relevant data to
substantiate what he said. We note with
regret that Mr. Morrison could not provide
us with any relevant data. What a disap-

‘ , pointment that an officer of his caliber could

make such -sweeping statements? unarmed
with data. Mr. Morrison was able to casti-

gate our government even though he knew
that the Nigerian government and Nigerian
students are involved in several programs at
Pitt.. ,

After all is said and done, this union is not
on a witch hunt. All we are doingis seeking
redress.for unwarranted derogatory com-
ments. Our country’s government has been

By BARRY ZASLOFF

This is the story that only a
university administrator could
love.

Clinton Davis, Steel Valley’s
Six Million Dollar Kid and per-
haps the fastest l7-year-old ever,
has narrowed his choice of col-
leges to Pitt and Villanova.
Whichever he chooses~—and it
now appears that Pitt has a slight
edge—Davis’ immediate pur-
poses will be education and pre-
paring for the 1984 Olympics,
rather than burning holes in tis
track. The kid who has recieved
nearly as many scholarship
offers as there are colleges in
A_merica will reject them all.

“He’s going to either Pitt or
Villanova fora year to prepare
for the Olympics and to get an,
education,” said Elbert
Kennedy, Davis’ close friend,
track advisor and mentor from
the New Image Track Club and
‘coach of the -Lady Panther track
team. “And he’s going to pay his
own way — I don’t want him on a
scholarship where he could be
tied down with the team, where a
coach could call him in the mid-
dle of the night and say, ‘I want
him to run for us.’ He needs the
freedom to prepare for the

Olympics.”

Davishas a lifelong dream of
competing in the Olympics.
Kennedy has a set course for
Davis to follow in order to reach
his goal, so naturally he is wary
of anything or anyone that might
run Davis off the track. But this
is difficult to imagine. It hasn't
happe_ned yet.

‘‘I want Clinton to develop
slow,” Kennedy said. “I’m afraid
that coaches would want to win
so badly that they would use him
too often in a meet and risk
injury, which Clinton is much
more prone to than the average
runner since he runs at a much
quicker pace. I just don’t want
them to use his body.”

There’s no doubting that
Davis is quicker than his peers.
He owns national and state
records, and he has the speed to
someday become the greatest
sprinter ever. Kennedy is follow-
ing him to the top, which is par-
tially why Davis will remain in
running distance of his coach.
Why tamper with the procedures
that have perhaps made Davis
the best high school sprinter of
all time?

“You don’t,” Kennedy ans-
wered. “You just don’t turn a kid
loose after he’s done something
with different methods all his

life, and expect him to perform
well.”

“He’s staying around here so
he can train with me for the
Olympics and for academics.
We’re going to control his work-
outs and where he goes" to
meets.” -

Which, is one reason why
Davis might be leaning toward '
Pitt. While"he would be close to
Kennedy at Villanova, he’d be
even closer at Pitt. He’d be in
precisely the same position he’s
been in for years. From here, he
could work out with Kennedy
seven nights a week if he so
desired; at Villanova, he could
only see him over the weekends.

But Kennedy insists that Vil-

lanova is still in the running. “I

know the coach there very well
— Charlie Jenkins,” Kennedy
said. “We get along pretty well.”

“I’ve talked with Charlie,” ‘he
said,~“and he’s given me a verbal
commitment that Clinton
wouldn‘t have to run till after the
Olympics, which is good because
winning the Big East isn’t impor-
tant to Clinton right now. And
right now, he doesn’t have to run

A in every college meet.”

“If he decides to go to Villa-
nova, the coach there will work
close with me with what we’ve
been doing up until now.”

  Davis Chasing Pitt, Villanova InT he Stretch Run j

But Clinton Davis hears a
motherly voice whispering for
him to stay home, for him to
make perhaps the shortest race
of his life. In short, she wants the
kid that owns national records in
the 300 and 400 meter dashes and
in the 200, 300 and 500 yard runs,
to remain by her side. _

“We’ve always wanted him to
stay home,” says Geraldine Tay-
lor, Davis’ adoptive mother.

7 “And if he does, we’ll be really,

really happy.”

“She’s so happy that he has
decided. to stay close to home,”
Kennedysays. “Clinton doesn’t
necessarily want to go to Pitt or
Villanova, but his mother sure is
glad.” .

Still, Davis’ days in Pittsburgh
are numbered. Kennedy says
that if he chooses Pitt, it will
solely be a matter of academics.
Davis will most likely attend Pitt
for one year, participate in the
Olympics and then transfer to a
univerisity with a strong track
program. ‘

“I haven’t even talked to Pitt

about Clinton running for
them,” Kennedy says. “If he stays

"here now, he’ll probably leave
' after the ’84 Olympics. He’ll have

different goals then. He’ll go
where he needs to go.”
“I just wouldn't want anyone

only a 17-year-old kid and he’s

:9

to think he’s coming here to run,"
Kennedy adds. “He wants to be
with a good program after the
Olympics, a program that's bet-
ter than him.” ‘ ’

Within the week, Davis will
reject scholarships from some
great track schools — including
UCLA, which is noted for its his-
tory of top sprinters and its good
running conditions.

But UCLA would put him too
far from Kennedy, from his
mother and perhaps from tearing
apart ‘Olympic records. He’d
have to start over. Oh, they’d still
need a fire extinguisher by his
side, a superhuman individual to
burn him out. But he’d be adjust-
ing to a different atmosphere,
different coaching techniques
and, above all, life in California.

“I think he’d go to UCLA if it
weren’t for the Olympics,”
Kennedy says. “But L.A. is a
rough town . . . a- fast town . . .
you know, it’s easy to get
involved with the wrong kind of ,
people.” '

And, as always, Davis is glanc-
ing in Kennedy’s direction for
advice. .

“I think so,” Kennedy says. “I
think he’s looking for me to tell
him. What do you expect? — he’s

got a great decision to make.”

been lacking in depth and

Revenge Victimizes Panthers

By LAURIE KUBLI

The Lady Panther basketball
team ended the season on a disap-
pointing note, losing to the George-
town Hoyas in the first round of the
Big East tournament in Providence,
R.l. It appeared that third—seeded
Pitt once again had the Hoyas on the

at the Civic Arena in a regular sea-

Providence‘s Alumni Hall. “We
didn‘t play as well as we could have,"
coach Judy Saurer said. Saurer also
accepted part of the blame; “I didn't

Army
Shootout  

By CHARLIE O'HARA

' Sweeps of the first three, places in
the side horse, parallel and high bar

events were the main factors in the’

Panther gymnastic team’s victory
over Army and Farmingdale at West
Point this past Saturday. .
The Panthers finished with a team
score of 267.45, easily outdistancing

the Army A team, which finished ’

second with 255.] points, followed
by Farmingdale andthe Army B
team.

“We won the meet outright,”
Coach Frank D’Amico said. “Army
had no_intentions of losing to Pitt a
couple of years ago when we were
planning the meet.”

This meet marked the first time
Pitt defeated the Black Knights at
Army. The Panthers defeated Army
at the Farmingdale Open earlier this
season. '

“When they announced Pitt’s
record with Army as 22-0, I said we
were out to change history,”
D’Amico recalled.

‘ In the "side horse, Mike Lloyd
took first place for the third meet in
a row with a score of 8.95. Chris
Femiani placed second, and Frank
Kratz finished third. Femiani won
the parallel bars with a score of 8.85
followed by freshman Mark Klafter
in second place (8.85) and a tie for
third between Kratz and Peters,
both scoring 8.8.

The Panthers took the first four
spots in the high bars as senior Dave
Smith won the event with a score of
9.3 followed by Klafter in second
and another tie for third—between

' Peters and Ed Miller.

Army Gunned Down 7

7 [By CHARLIE O'HARA

By the middle of last week,
Panther coaches John Vasvary and
Steve Lewis had decided to enter the
Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic

' Association of America (IC4A)
meet, with the intention of qualify-
ing runners for the NCAA cham-
pionships at the Silverdome_ in
Pontiac, Mich. .

With this strategy in mind, th
coaches decided not to enter‘ the

, team’s three relay squads. Also, jun-

>’ior Todd Colas, who has already

continued from page seven

D’Amico was particularly pleased
with Miller’s performance.

“I was extremely happywith Ed,”
he said. “He really surprised me on
the high bar. He has been one of the

. ' most consistent scorers all season.”.

Kratz won the all-around with a
score of 53.00, and Klafter took top
spot on the rings with an 8.95.

qualified for -the NCAA in both the
1000-meter run and the 3200-meter
relay, was given the week off in order
to train solely for the NCAA’s. In
addition, senior All-America 800-
meter runner Darren Geary was
absent from the weekend’s festivities
because he was busy taking the
Secret Service test.

To take this‘ much away from the
team and then expect them to be
competitive is a tall order. _It was too
much for the Panthers who were
only able to get one competitor past
the qualifying heats and into the

the Eastern rankings go.

“We are calling the next two
weeks ‘the two-tenths factor,’ ” he
said. “If the top live scores get two-
tenths higher, we will get the second
ranking in the East.”

“There’s almost a guarantee that
we’ll place second in the East this
year.” '

NOTES: Freshman shot-putter Bob ~

Buczkowski was unable to make the
trip due to his obligations to the
football team. Coaches Vasvary and
Lewis will be present atthe High

School Eastern indoor champion- i

ships today in an effort to lure unde-
cided seniors to Pitt.

  

finals.

Sophomore Roger Kingdom
made it to the finals in two events —
the 55-meter high hurdles and the
high jump. Due to scheduling con-
ﬂicts, he was unable to compete In

\ the high jump, but in the hurdles he

placed fourth with a time of 7.33, far
from his Big East runner-up effort
7.20. Kingdom's four points were

I thelonly points scored by the Panth-

ers in the entire meet.

Prior to the meet, Vasvary said
that he believed several of the Panth-
ers would have good chances of
qualifying for the NCAA meet, des-
pite the difficult standards.

Senior Terry Gallagher also had a
good chance at qualifying, but he fell
short. Despite running a 1:52.10,
faster than the winning time in one
of the other semi-final heats, Gal-
lagher was also eliminated.

Several other Panthers made it to
the semi-final heats but were also
edged out of the finals. Seniors Rick
Asberry (55-meter dash) and Mario
Joyner (400-meter dash) ran times of
6.50 and 48.7, respectively,’ while_
junior Bill Moorhead ran a time~of
2:26.9 in his semi-ﬁnal 1000-meter
runiheat.

There isn't much to say except
that the Panthers had a lot of trouble‘
dealing with some excellent compe-
tition. With a field of over 100 teams

perform well when its strengths were

So, thinking they are cleaning up‘

Reveling so much, you might say,

happen, brace yourself no_w, we
would all see university attendance

_drop because students would be

scared half out of their minds know-
ing that straight “C5” are the rule of
the day.

- Now sit back and. seriously ask
yourself: Why aren’t students in
today’s schools required to fall
under certain grading restrictions in
order to receive credit for attending
school? Is that sacrilege?

No, it’s not. But what it all comes 0

down to is the almighty dollar. If the
average public high school would
lose attendance due to dropouts or
transfers or if the college should lose
the student because of the glaring 2.0
restriction, then either state funding’
would be cut or tuition levels would
plunge earthwardl Not everyone can
handle that 2.0 minimum discipline.

‘So with that in mind, school admin-
istrators in high schools and colleges

would never even entertain any
thoughts of pressuring entire studnt
bodies into maintaining certain
grades.

Well, for administrators with that
kind of mind, it is obvious that there
isn’t much density between their two
cars. And after Proposition 48 and
its . ensuing Wilkinsburg charter,

precedents are indeed» starting to .

make their mark in the world of edu-
cation. Beware, though. These kinds
of precedents may be dangerous to
your educational capabilities and
potentialities.
