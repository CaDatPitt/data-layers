Brihe Case
’ Sebastian Convicted.
Of Attempted Hoop
Fix of Pitt Games

By TED COLTON

-»A former instructor in the
University’s Dental School
was found guilty on two
counts ofattempt bribery last
Thursday in a’ Pittsburgh
court room. . .

Dr. Edward H. Sebastian, 32,
was convicted of" attempting to
bribe two Panther basketball
.players to “shave points” in the
Cats’ hoop games.

John Fridley and Dick Falen—
ski, both stars on the 1960 bask-
etball team testiﬁed that Sebas-
tian had oitered them “One half
of his winnings on the ﬁxed
games, a new car at half price, a
$1,000 diamond ring for $400, a
guarantee that they would be ad-

‘omitted to dental school and help
in grades.”
Dental Help

Sebastian’s story was that the
boys came to him for help to get
in dental school and when he
didn’t do anything to help them,
the players got mad and cooked
up this story about the bribe.

After the trial Falenski com-
mented, “I don’t care what hap-
:-pens to him. When he came to

Fridley we had to protect our-

selves. I don’t like playing El-

liot Ness.”

Sebastian can be sentenced to
a maximum term of ten years’

imprisonment and $10,000 ﬁne on.

verdict. ‘

Chuck Isler, president, suggested that the cafeteria be
opened in the evenings to allow group or individual study-

Susan Waite, Arts jr., has re-

which is presented monthly by the
sophomore honorary fraternity to

standing contribution to Univer-
sity activities.

Miss Waite was cited for her

easily accessible during winter
months, he added. ~
“Such an arrangement would
not only beneﬁt resident stu-
dents, but also commuters from
several different areas who
want a central meeting place to
study in a, group. The Student
Union Board is in full accord
with our using the cafeteria in
the evenings,” stated Isler.
Another issue which was
brought up by Isler was the need
of a sponsor for the Pitt Chest.
The position of chairman is still

open, and waiting to be ﬁlled by
a competent individual or to .be
assumed by an organization on
campus.

The student body as a whole
was» blasted by Isler for the lack
of enthusiasm displayed in previ-
ous Chest Fund drives. “It is ri-
diculous for a school of this size to

come out with a total of less thahgsohonloy Plaza tomorrow evening

$300, especially over a period of a
year,” he said.

The Pitt Chest is the single
annual charity drive to which
University, students contribute.
Funds are distributed to ﬁve

agencies, among them the
United Fund of Allegheny
County.

The Chest is not only a money-

A program, the purpose of which was to achieve “

The speaker was Dr. Adolph Grunbaum, of the Depart-
ment of Philosophy. Dr. Grun-%
ﬂbaum received his Ph.D. from
Yale University and has written
many articlestand several books,
the most recent of Which, “Philo-
sophical Problems of Space and
Time," is now being published.

The topic of his lecture was
“how the natural sciences con-
tribute to the elucidation of the
nature of time." It is natural that
when hot and cold water are
poured top;cther their tempera-
tures will equalize; it is not na-
tural, however, that luke-warm
Water will separate into a hot and
a cold layer, or is it?

in this case We have been only
considering a “branching sub-
system” in the universal system.
Decrease in entropyin small sys-
tems is bought at the expense of
an increase in the entropy of the
larger system of which they are
a part. ‘

Since you began reading this
article, entropy has been increas-
ing. You will remember, how-
ever, that memory traces go hand-
in-hand with entropy increases;
therefore, lament not this increase

Time Reversed

low the possibility of the converse
of certain processes with increase
in time. “The dead do not rise
with increasing but only with de-
creasing time,” said Dr. Grun-
baum. For time to be reversible,
it would have to be “isotropic;”
but Dr. Grunbaum reminds us of
the biological law that if time
were isotropic. life could not exist.
A ﬂow or flux of time is char-
acteristic bf psychological time.
1 Earlier and later must be distin-
guished from past and future.
“A preferred existential status is
assigned to the ‘now’ of any
particular observer; past and fu-
ture depend on this ‘now,’ ” he
explained. As “now” shifts from,
an earlier to a later state, time
is observed to ﬂow. —
Undergraduate physics teaches
that the second law of thermo-
dynamics states that the entropy
of a closed system can only in-4
crease. Dr. Grunbaum proceeds to
prove that this may be, or indeed
is, false. “In the actual “world,
the production of memory traces
goes hand-in-hand with the in-
crease of entropy," he related.
Entropy Decreased
But, it forward progression of
time or the “time arrow” is ac-
companied by an increase in en-
tropy, reversal of this must re-
sult in a decrease in entropy.
However, Dr. Grunbaum reasons
that “there can be no problem of
time ﬂowing forward or back-
ward when it does not flow at
all because there is physically no
psychological ‘now’.”
Physics is saved by the fact that

Although Hawkins was an ama-

‘H  Last Temptation of Christ’ by 

 Skill, Vigor Gives

Novel

  
     
 

 

Authority

By WILLIAM BENNETT

Bernard Shaw ‘once wrote to a young author who had
asked his advice on writing a passion play that to write ef-
fectively about Jesus was nearly impossible. Only the most
skilled writer could handle such a subject without falling in-
to a barren secularized reiteration of the Gospels.

In 1951, a few years before his death, Nikos Kazantzakis

wrote “The Last Temptation of¢

Christ,” the last of a massive trip-
tych of biblical novels. Writing
with a stylistic vigor reminiscent
of D. H. Lawrence, he showed
himself to be an expert writer.

This is not a biography of
Christ, said Kazantzakis. Instead,
it is “the confession of every man
who struggles.” And such a man
was Kazantzakis himself, whose
whole life was an attempt to tran-
substantiate the ﬂesh into the
spirit.

Destiny Hammered

For me, it is this audacious
autobiographical approach to
Jesus, this portrait of a man who
hammers his spiritual destiny out
of his own doubts and agonies,
that lifts it far above the pious
but spiritless biblical novel.

At the beginning of the novel,
we see Jesus as very much a
man of the flesh, tormented by
his knowledge that God has
spiritual plans that he cannot
escape from. He has already
tried, and ‘failed.

As the novel continues, Jesus
conquers his temptations, one
after another. Slowly, often pain-
fully, he changes from the’ cow-
ardly son of a crippled carpenter
into the Messiah who has, the
courage to be cruciﬁed for man-
kind.

Tormented to the End

On the cross, Jesus is tormented
by the last temptation ——a vision
in which he sees himself as he
might have been had he chosen to

 

  

avoid cruciﬁxion. Heis a gentle
grandfather, surrounded by happy
grandchildren and two wives. He
is happy, carefree.

But then the vision changes.
He is surrounded by. his apos-
tles, who denounce him as a
traitor to his destiny, a de-
serter to the future of the
world. The smug old man is
horriﬁed, realizing his coward-
ice.

A second before his death, Jesus
banishes the visions. He sees that
he has achieved the ﬁnal triumph,
and shouts, “It is accomplished!”
and dies. Kazantzakis concludes:
“It was as though he had said:
Everything is begun.”

Death Sufficient

For Kazantzakis, ,Christ’s death
on the cross was enough. There
was no need for a resurrection.
“The Messiah,” he said “is one
who dies because he loves the
whole world.”

The overall style of this book
is a nervous, rough—hewn "one.
The "often crude and frenzied
writing enhances the struggle‘ of
Christ and his followers, the
desperation of their uncertain
attempts to create a new world
for themselves.

Unfortunately, it also often
gives the impression of careless-
ness. “The Last Temptation of
Christ” is not a novel in which
one takes. delight in beautiful de-
tail. Its beauty lies in its over-
whelming sweep and magnitude.

Improve tire library

The number of books in the University library is far
less than it should be. Presently, the library consists of,ap-
proximately 640,000 volumes. ,

This number is not impressive, when one considers
‘that Harvard’s library houses six and a half million vol-
umes, and Yale’s, four and a quarter million.

No substantial increase in the number of books is
expected in the near future. Although $10 million has
been allocated for the new Hillman Library, all of this
amount will be spent on construction; none will be used to
purchase books. v ,

The University spends 1.9 per cent of itsannual budget

   

library staff. The median amount of money spent by other
universities on their libraries is 3.7 per cent of the annual
budget. ' ,

 _ There is a deﬁnite need for a larger portion of money
 from the University budget for library purposes. Certainly
' an institution that strives to develop high scholarship should
willingly allocate whatever funds‘ are necessary for main-
, taining an adequate library.

0 There are other sources from which money might be
obtained for the library, which seemingly have not been
tapped.

An alumni library association should be formed which
would solicit not only money, but collections of books. In
tnanyuniversities, this is one of the major methods for ac-
quiring books.

Recently a student group, the Student Friends of the
Library, was established to foster interest in the library
and to promote its development. This group should be able
to help solve many of the library problems," and to better
:ommunication between students and administration in
this crucial area. .

They will not have much inﬂuence, however, in obtain-
Eng the much needed funds and collections of books. This
must be done through hard work by the administration and
by inﬂuential alumni and community members.

It must be kept in mind that the fine structure of the
luture Hillman Library is designed and planned primarily
a lo house a good collection of reading and research materials.

Student

By Jim ‘Vaughan

“The Student Union, -which has been discussed
for a period of years, has ﬁnally opened its doors

to Pitt students . . . Assistant chancellor for istudent‘

affairs has announced the inauguration of the’ Mid-

day Series . . . since its move from Clapp Hall to..

the Union today, Pitt's Place- 

than ninety percent ofpthe place- 0
rnent officers in the country . . .
formal . dedication of Schenley 
Hall, signifying the completion
of union and dormitory facilities, .
will take place tomorrow at 2:
p.m. in the Student Union Ball-j
room . . .”

These statements appeared in
The Pitt News during the first
three weeks of school in the Fall
Semester of 1957. They marked the official birth of
the Student Union. “

But the place wasn’t really a student union.
Not yet. ,

During that first year little social life went on
there, and cultural activities were just beginning
to appear. Students seldom used the lounge. They
held a couple dances each month, showed a few
movies, and scheduled some prototype Midday lec-
tures. 'That was about all. The SU was a place
where the students ate -— little more.

But now, the place is different. It is trulya
student union, though a modest one. For thousands
of university people —- undergraduate and grad-
uate students, academic and non-academic per-
sonnel -9- the Student Union is the center of cul-
tural and social activity.

Selection ls Superb

Within the last two weeks, we have had the
opportunity to hear Aldous Huxley speak at at Mid-
day program, hear Dr. Solomon Freehof give a
book review, see the Indian ﬁlm “Pather Panchali,”
hear a Mellon Professor speak, and attend other
interesting programs.

In addition to the fine Activities Fair held in the
ballroom, there has also been a pep rally and a
square dance in the Schenley quadrangle.

In the Student Union, large numbers of students
gather daily, at all hours, in a natural informal at-
mosphere. They gather in the surroundings of a
good art collection and a pleasant looking and
comfortable set of furniture.

How has all this come about?

In December of 1955, Pitt bought the Schenley
Apartments. They were to be used as dormitories.
Two months later, we bought the Schenley Park
Hotel. This was to be used “as a part of the

“Vision"

By Ina Aimdurn
A modern poet has said that

some can look at the universe completely

learn to look at a grain of sand
and see the universe. However,
there is a third '
kind or indivi-
dual_ not men-
tioned; he just

 
 

 

 

veil which cloaks that mystery.
None of us ever succeeds in
understanding
riddle. Learning to see takes a
lifetime, and no one has perfect
eyesight at the end. Most of use
are myopic or suffering from
serious astigmatisms.
Traditionally, it is the artist

planned student center.” About seven months
later, on the recommendation of Dr. Charles Peake,
the University appointed: as SU Director Dr. Wil-
liam Swartzbaugh, a specialist in the area of stu-
dent personnel, and director (for four years) of the
Ohio State Student Union.

Swatrzbaugh soon organized and co-ordinated
the "Midday Series programs, and worked closely
with University organizations in planning programs
and formulating policies. 0

By far the most important organization which
Dr. Swartzbaugh helped create was the student
Union Board. This board, composed of nine stu-
dents appointed by Student Congress, worked
closely with Swatrzbaugh. ,

Unlike other student groups that spring up,
engage in a little ﬂurried activity, and then dis-
solve, the Student Union Board grew
matured. It is now composed of six students who
maintain a close relationship with the offices of
the deans of men and women, Saga Food Service,
and the SU Director, William Cooper. 0
Operated by Students

The Board now runs the Student Union on a
$153,000 budget. The Board will spend $20,000 on
programs, and the rest on maintenance and opera-
tion expenses of the Student Union.

With 150 students working actively on its com-v

mittees, it has scheduled more than 500 programs
in such areas as dances, “Quotes and Comments,”
“Soap Box Pitt,” “University P.M.” (an evening
program of the calibre of Midday), jazz programs,
“On Saturday Afternoon” (dances, lectures, mixers,
and discussions), “Pitt Programs” (based on en-
tertainment by talented Pitt people), bridge mixers
and tournaments, and bi-weekly coffee hours.

It is gratifying that these programsattract the
large number of people that they do. To be more

exact, they do not “attract.” Rather, they provide _

a much needed and desired service.

The Student Union has ﬁnally become a real
studentiunion. When it opened this ‘triterm it ap-
peared. surprisingly mature, as does .a girl when
she wears her ﬁrst evening gown (some girls, that
is). It has taken on a used bustling informal at-
mosphere. It has developed a homogeneous per-
sonality. , ‘

The Union has also changed partly because a
supporting population of resident ‘students has
ﬁnally come along. These students make use of
the Union, not as a home,‘ but as a social and cul-
tural center. Andtheir presence — as well as the
activities they generate —- attracts many non-
residents.

The real work, though, is done by the Student
Union Board, the SU director, Mr. Cooper, and the
staff of the SU offices.

Wanted: Closer Perception

One trip would be to a slum
area; another to a wealthy com-
munity. One day would be spent
riding on a streetcar, while the
next would be passed sitting in a
bar. An old—age home and a
kindergarten also be

stopping off places. And so the
itinerary would progress until

might be that the kind of experi-

ence to which Huxley was refer-

ring is not accessible to everyone

to equal degrees,'but is some-

what accessible to all ‘of us. The

danger is that most of us belong

to the third category; we don’t
care enough to look.

The kind of visionary experi-
ence. that each of us »is able to
have is dependent neither on
self-imposed isolation nor on
dope-addiction. All that is nec-
essary is the awareness that the
woi‘ld is a mystery and that part
of our dignity as human beings
lies in the attempt to compre-
hend it. 0

Education itself -‘should he at »

who has the vision for which all
of us yearn. Yet one can strive
for artistic experience, even if
one is not capable of artistic
creation. The artist can observe
experience and is able to add to
this observation the insight and
the understanding necessary to
interpret it in his art.

One deﬁnition of vision could
be that faculty of experiencing
the world and of deriving from
that experience something of
value above the immediate sense
impression which one receives.
Many have seen Grecian urns,
but few have derived as much
from this sight as Keats did.
Department of "Vision"

It is unfortunate that we have
no department at the University
called “vision,” and that one
cannot be a “vision” major. The
course would have no text, ex-
cept the one the student writes

as he goes along- The curric-.

ulum would consist ofaseries of

   
 

ohserv tions done by the indivi-

served the tragedy and the com-
edy, the. nobility and the de-
gradation which constitute man’s
existence. The ﬁnal exam would

consist of one question: “What

have you seen?”
It's Too Unscholarly

This is all conjecture. We have
no course in vision. Such snap
courses are not suitable for the
scholars that inhabit our uni-
versity or any other one. If it
were offered, how many would
sign up for it‘? Perhaps it is a
case of cowardice.

We don’t want to see anything
that will detract from our state
of delirious ignorance. Seeing
might cause suﬁfering to the ob-
server. Suffering might cause
consciousness, and “conscious-
ness is a “disease.” It might
spread and cause disagreeable
symptoms.

It seems that at least for a
while, the “mystery in the poet’s
heart” will stay where it is. We

in my opinion, is what caused him

 Wide Range of Material

By SHEILA MALLINGER
If you walk straight ahead after going throughthe turn-
stile in the Book Center, you willenter the Fine Book Room
where volumes published by The University of Pittsburgh

Press are on display.

If you didn’t know about these books, or even that our
University had its own press, you are not alone, for the books

which i‘. publishes are not widely0
’ read.

This is the purpose a university
press serves. Jt publishes books
that commercial publishers can’t
afford to handle because of their
limited appeal.

These books are scholarly in
content — that is, relatively few
people except those in the same
profession are able to un ierstand
them. Often they are interpreta-
tions of other authors’ works;
sometimes they are books of re-
gional interest such as “Penn’s
Woods West,” by Edwin L. Peter-
son, head of the University’s Eng-
lish ~ department.

Mrs. Agnes Starrett, director
and editor of the Press, has
been at the University for 38
years. She is a professor of
English but has held her present
position since 1952. Mrs. Star-
rett is author of “First 150
Years,” a history of the Uni-
versity. ‘

“There are approximately forty
university Presses in the country,”
says Mrs. Starrett. “We all be-
long to the Association of Ameri-
can University Presses which
meets once a year on _various
campuses to discuss problems

‘which arise in publishing and to

exchange ideas.”

Usually authors from Univer-
sity communities submit their
manuscripts to the University
Press. ‘People in the academic ﬁeld
are especially anxious to be -pub-
lished because a person isn’t real-
ly a scholar until he has been
published so that others can chal-
lenge his thinking. “Also he has a

he is better known,” Mrs. Starrett
said. A

Mrs. Starrett added that,4“No
fiction is published by these
presses. We feel that this is a
job for commercial publishers.”
The Press turns out manuscripts
of varied appeal. “Its scope is as
wide as the University,” she
commented. ‘

There are several contests each

year in which books are judged on

» the basis of content, style, physi-

cal appearance, and craftsman-
ship. “The University of Pitts-
burgh Press has won several
prizes in these competitions, but
one, which. we are especially

pleased with is Dr. Peterson’s
book, which is the only entry to
which the judges gave a perfect
score,” Mrs. Starrett said proudly.

The University of Pittsburgh
Press has published ‘about 140
books and usually releases be-
tween ten and eighteen per year.

VVHAT TO DO TILL THE
PSYCHIATRIST COMES

Once upon a time at the University of Virginia. there was a.
coed named, oddly enough, Virginia University who was hand-
some and kindly and intelligent and ingeniously constructed
and majoring in psychology. Virginia went steady with a young
man on campus named, oddly enough, Oddly Enough who was
supple and fair and lithe and animated and majoring in physed.

Virginia and Oddly enjoyed a romance that was as idyllic as

. a summer day, as placid as a millpond. Never did they ﬁght—-

never, never, nevcr!—because Virginia, who was majoring in
psychology, did not believe in ﬁghting. “I*‘ighting,” she often
said, “settles nothing. The scientiﬁc way is to look calmly for
the cause of the friction.”

So whenever she and Oddly were on the verge of a quarrel,
she used to whip out a series of ink blot tests and they would
discover the true underlying cause of their dispute and deal
with it in an enlightened, dispassionatc manner. Then, the
irritant removed, their romance would r_esume its tranquil,
serene, unruffled course.

   

/

After six months of this sedate liaison, Oddly, was so bored
he could spit. He loved Virginia well enough, but he also be-
lieved that people in love ought to ﬁght now and then. “It
opens the pores,” he said. “And besides, 'it’s so much fun mak-
ing up afterwards.” ,

‘But Virginia would not be provoked into a quarrel. One night
Oddly tried very hard. “Hey,” he said to her, “your nose looks
like a. banana, and your ears look like radar antenna, and your
face looks like a pan of worms.”

, “My goodness, \_re’re hostile tonight!” said Virginia cheerfully
a.nd whipped 120 Rdrschach cards out of her reticule. “Come,’3
she said, “let us examine your psychic apparatus.” V

Oddly tried again. “You’re fat and dumb and disagreeable]?

. he said, “and you’ll be bald before you’re thirty.”

“Hmm,” said Virginia thoughtfullyland lit a cigarette. “This
sounds like an anxiety neurosis with totemism, an-agogic trauma,
and a belt in the back.” i

“I hate you,” said Oddly. “I hate your looks and your clothes
and your toenails and your relatives and the cigarettes you
smoke.”

“Now, hold on, buster!” cried Virginia, her eyes crackling,
her color mounting, her nostrils aﬂame. “Just keep a civil
tongue in your stupid head‘ when you talk about Marlboro!
Nobody’s knocking that ﬁlter, that ﬂavor, that pack or ﬂip-top
box while.there’s breath in my body! It’s a full-ﬂavored smoke,
it’s a doozy, it’s a dilly, it’s a gas-and anybody who says a
word against it gets this.” - 2 A / ' _ g_

By “this” Virginia meant a series of combinations to the
hea.d.a.nd’liver, which she now delivered to Oddly and turned
on her heel and stormed away. ‘ ' ,'

Oddly brought her down with a flying tackle. .“I love you . 

with all my heart,” he said. i
(‘And Marlboro?” said she.
f‘And Marlboro even more,” said he. - -
And they kissed and pla-ited love knots in one another’s hair

and were married at Whitsuntide and smoked happily ever after.

Saturday’s 15-14 loss‘to the
Sooners of Oklahoma came when
the Cat’s Freddie Cox, who had
been a standout throughout the
game, had his punt blocked by

Phil Lohmann early in the fourth

quarter. The Sooners recovered
the ball on the Panthers 11 yard
line. '

Fake Kick Works

On the second play after the
blocked punt, Don Dickey scooted
over from ﬁve yards out to score.
On the all-important extra point,
the Sooners used a fake kick with
Bob Wyatt going around right
end for the two points and the
win.

portant to the Panthers. Late in

For the ﬁrst time in three tries

Traﬁcant came in at quarterback
and looked great as he directed
the Panthers to two scores.

Ed Sharockman ﬁnally dis-
played some of his 1958 form as
a ﬁne runner. The Panther for-

ing as the Blue and Gold rolled
up 256 yards rushing and 116
yards passing. This was only
the eleventh time in 14 years
that the Sooners were outgained
on the ground.

On Defense Paul Hodge and
Cunningham stood out for the
Cats. Hodge was credited with 13
tackles and Jumbo Jim with 12.
Next was DaveoKraus with only

Cox scored both touchdowns for
the Cats with a 34 yard pass
from Traﬁcant and a three yard

Booters Lose First to

 

2-1, Beat Slippery

Cats Hold Ohio

Scoreless for 1st
Three Quarters

By JOHN FLEl\rIING

The Panther booters met’ if

their ﬁrst defeat of the season
Saturday at the hands of Ohio

University, 2-1, in their home
debut.

The Panthers were able to
hold the tough Ohio O. team

scoreless for three quarters but
then the Ohioans scored two quick
goals in the ﬁnal quarter. The only
score for the Blue and Gold came
in the closing minutes of the sec-
ond period when Ed Weihrauch
got the ball past the Ohio goalie.

Bob Barraj opened the ﬁnal pe-
riod with a goal for Ohio and was
followed four minutes later by
John Weinland’s winning score.
The Ohio teams had a great deal
of speed which helped them beat
the Cats.

Playing Under Handicap

The booters were playing under
severe handicap with several key
players injured. Corky Cuthbert
was unable to play any part of the
game. Pete Smith played, but a
leg injury kept him from being in
top form. Add to that the injuries
of Ron Prado and Carl Templin
and it is not hard to see that the
Jungle Cats were not up to par.

Steve Daniels, Cal Smith and
Bob McNulty all looked good
and had the other players been
in good shape, the outcome
might have been different. The
“Little Leprechaun,” Pete Smith,
said, “It is good that we did lose.
Now, we know that we can be
beaten.”

Commenting on the Ohio team,
Coach Bemis said, “They are a
good position team and they work
hard. They have two pretty good
fullbacks and a couple of good
shooters. We still should have
won.”

Harry Stokes Comes in Second

Cat Harriers Finish Third in Meet

By JIM O’BRIEN

Central State and Ohio U.

both outran the Panther har-

riers to ﬁnish ﬁrst and second respectively in a triangular
cross-country meet at Columbus, Ohio on Saturday after-

_ noon. ~

Harry Stokes was the only brightilight in a dismal day
for the Cat thinclads. Stokes running in his second varsity

meet, ﬁnished second to pace the¢

Cat runners across the ﬁnish.

Stokes led for the ﬁrst two miles
and then a Central State boy
passed him. He stayed with him
for awhile, but fell back at the
four mile mark. and couldn’t
make it up. ,

“He did really well,” Coach
Carl Rees said, “this is only his
second running year in college
and by the end of the season he
should be running exceptionally
well.”

Pace Too Slow

Besides the enemy runners, the
most influential factor in the
Panther’s downfall was the un-
famuiar course. It was a flat
course which is quite in contrast
with the hilly Flagstoff course.

“Our kids started out in their

normal pace and the other run-
ners dashed off fast.” Rees com-
mented, “Our boys thought they
were running too fast so early
in the race and laid back. Our
kids were way back when they
1-ea.1iz¢d, .their_ pace ,.was‘ too

After Stokes, the next Panther
runner was Bob Tarkany who

Carter, Reed Clarke and Bill
Hinchberger.
Cats In Group
Rees was pleased with the boys
running in a group, but he said,
“We ran in a group, but we were
so far back. We did very poorly,
and I’m disappointed. We weren’t
used to such a course, but that’s
still no excuse.” A
“Last week our spread was
only 46 seconds against Slippery
Rock, and this time we were two-
minutes and some apart.”
He added that Central State had
a ﬁne team and felt they were
more experienced. “We have
mostly sophomores, and they are
inexperienced, but that’s no ex-
cuse etiher.”
Home Course Advantage
Ohio University had been shut-
out by the Panthers two years in
a row in dual meets, but manag-
ed to slip ahead of the Cats on
Saturday. Their main advantage
was that they were running on
their home course.
Rees felt that the team could
have won if our second and

third man would have ﬁnished a
little higher. “\Ve are in good
shape and I expected them to
do much better.”
The team has a 1-1 record nowf

versity in Saturday's ‘soccer match. The Panthers went on to lose,
2-1, in their ﬁrst defeat of the season, although their defense held
Ohio U. scoreless in the ﬁrst three quarters.

Defensive Battle

The game was mostly a defen-
sive battle with most of the action
taking place between the two
teams’ 30 yard lines.

Last Wednesday the booters had
an unexpected tough time with
Slippery Rock but managed to pull
out the victory in the last 50 sec-
onds of the second ﬁve minute

overtime period.

Paul Liberati scored the first
Panther goal late in the ﬁrst quar-
ter with the Rockets following up
with their lone tally. From then
until the sesond overtime neither
team could break the others de-
fensive barrier. Dom Uawithya
ﬁnally scored the winning score on
a pass from Liberati.

Dolinar Ties
Player in Yogi;
Smith Leads

Once again the mighty
yogae have proven that they
alone are the forseers of the
future. Jumpin’ Jack Smith
has continued his torrid pace
with a 10-5 record that sur-
passed anything else the yogae
could come up with.

This fine showing has put Smith
four full games in front of his
nearest competitors. The - magic
number for Jack is 55. Much to
the dismay of the male yogi Smith

nearest competitor is Joanne
(Speedy) Dolinar.
Her 9-6 chart of Saturday’s

game was good enough to enable
her to move into a second place
tie with the player, who was Ron
Delfine. '
Delﬁne said, “This is really a
shame. First they get the right

to vote, then they start running
for public office and now they
enter the yogi race. It has to

uttered, “Just wait for a .couple

more weeks and I’ll be on top.”
Meanwhile down on the yogi

pole Marshall Romeo, Consensus, L

the coach and Ted Colton are
planning a way to get past the

with a overall 20-18 record. Last
week he had a 6-9 chart.
The coach, Jack VViley, posted
a 8-7 record which brought their
total to 20-18. Even mighty con-
census fell this week with a 7-8
record but he blames it on Col-
ton who has been helping him.
Once again Colton has astonish-
ed the experts by not reaching the
.500 mark. His 5-10 record was
the worst to date by any yogi. He
can still be seen sitting at his
typewriter trying to ﬁgure out
what is going wrong this year.
There is a rumor going around
that Colton is trying to contact
players who will be willing to
“shave points” so he can get back
into the yogi race.

Larry Lauchle
Tells of Olympic
Experiences

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

 

Now that the 1960 Olympics are over and the United States is
ﬁnally adjusting to the fact that the Russians are putting out the
best athletes, I think it is about time we get a first hand report on
what it is like to be on a U. S. squad. I contacted Larry Lauchle,
Pitt’s 130 pound Eastern champ, who represented the U. S. in the 125
pound Greco-roman style wres-
tling class. _.

Lauchle had heard of Greco-
roman wrestling only a month be-
fore the Olympics but he man- 
aged to beat everyone he met in
the U. S. and make the trip to

Here is Larry’s account of his 
trip. I
“We had a great time. We
left New York by plane. It
was a 16 hour trip but two
hours out we had eaten all the food and drank all the pop. After
that it turned out to be a pretty hungry trip.

“Before the matches it was mostly all work and no play. The
first boy I wrestled was from Japan. I was winning 8-6 until the last
minute but then I found myself on my back. He pinned me.

“My next opponent was from Turkey and he gobbled me up. He
was beating me about I5-0 when he ﬁnally caught me and then it was
all over. We didn’t place a man in the Greco-roman style but in the
free—style we had six boys win medals.

“After I lost, Fritz Fivian a Swiss native, now living in San
Francisco, and I. went up to his Swiss home. We toured the coun-
tryside for three days. Theyihad great ﬂoor shows there. Some-
thing like you would see in a Beatnik joint in New York.

“We had several experiences while we were in Europe. One time
when we went to see the old Roman Coliseum we were standing in
the middle thinking about all the movies we had seen about the
Christians being eaten by the hungry lions.

“Just then a small kitty came charging out from behind the
cages and we took off for the hills.

“I did get into a little trouble over there but at the time it
seemed very funny. Just before we were ready to leave we rented
a car. It was one of those small Fiat 500's.

“There were six of us in it. Over in Rome they all drive like
maniacs. We were in this big square and cars were coming at me
from all directions. I heard a crunch and we all jumped out. Sure
enough there was another car tangled up in our bumper.

“We lifted the cars apart while this Italian kept calling us crazy
Americans in his own tongue. One of the boys could understand him
and started calling him a crazy Italian.

“Meanwhile we had about 1000 cars all stopped and they
kept blowing their horns at us. And this Italian kept shaking his
ﬁnger at us and shouting ‘You crazy Americans.’

“We started to laugh and take pictures of the whole thing.
cops came and we couldn’t understand them for the language
rier was too much for us to overcome.

“The next day the cops were looking for me to get the $40
damage that was done to the other guy’s car. They found me at the
beach and took me to the American Olympics headquarters. There
they got me a lawyer. He arranged for me to meet this fellow the

Action Today

Today will be the big day
in the Independent intramur-
al football league. The two
teams that. are expected to

 

battle it out for the cham-

pionship will meet in the
fourth game of the season. This
game features the Chinese Bandits,
last year’s champs, and the run-
ner-up from last year the Psi O’s.

The Bandits are led by Alex
Pirinus and Larry Carra, both
have been inﬂuential in the teams

In the Inter-fraternity League

F rosh Gridders
Score 27-0 Win

The Panther frosh gridders
were very impressive in their 27-0
first game victory over the In-
diana State Reserves at Indiana
last Wednesday.

Halfback Leeson and Quarter-
back Paul Martha led the Cat
Cubs. Martha lived up to Coach
Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi’s hopes as
he passed and ran for consider-
able yardage. Cecconi said,
“Nowadays a quarterback must
run and pass and Martha can do
both very well.’’

Leeson scored twice, the ﬁrst
was a 40 yard screen pass and the
second a 28-yard fullback draw.
Other scoring saw Pete Billy skirt
around end on a 13-yard run and
John Gregg go for 5 yards off
tackle.

SQUASH MEETING

Coaches Ben Pope and Bill
Summers have called a meeting
of all squash candidates for 4
o’clock in the Field House Con-
ference room. There are posi-
tions open on both the frosh and
varsity teams and anyone inter-
ested in trying out should at-
tend this meeting.

didn't play soccer as a freshman,
but there was no doubt of his
gaining a starting berth once he
unveiled his ability on the prac-
tice-ﬁeld. -

“He "is a conservative player,”
Bemis said, whom the other fel-
lows seek advice from. He has
real good skills. Because he is
older, they look up to him.”

Bemis added that because of his
lack of size, Smith is out of posi-
tion, but is badly needed by the
team. “He is a natural wing or
outside man. He centers the ball
well and has a beautiful cross. He
is not big enough to play center-
forward, but we need him there.”

Soccer Team Sparked by P.Smith

Irish Booter Helps

Coach Bemis Keep

Squad on its Toes
By JIM O’BRIEN

Football reigns supreme on
the American college fall
sports agenda but not so in
the other regions of the world
where soccer is king. Pete
Smith, an Irish immigant, is
living proof of this statement.

Pete is one of the “big” guns on
the Panther soccer team.

Coach Leo Bemis has to start
from scratch to teach a boy the
fundamentals of the game, but
Pete came here with proﬁcient
skills already mastered. _

Although the backbone of the
Cat booters is composed primarily
of Pittsburgh area boys, the team
has more international ﬂavor than

‘any other sport at the University.
Besides Pete, Bemis has represen-
tatives of Thailand, Korea, Iran,
Poland, Germany and South Am-
erica on the squad.

Has Good Skills

Pete Smith is 25 years old and
is only about 5'6” tall. He is in
the pre-business administration
school in his third trimester. He

True Irish Spirit

Pete, in the true Irish spirit, has
a big heart and high spirits. He
is the team, comedian and keeps
the fellows feeling good. But
life’s not all play for Pete. In col-
lege soccer, most of the boys are
bigger and they are aggressive.
This takes quite a toll on him,
especially when they double-team
him or rough him up.

Pete can’t devote the time he
should to playing soccer either.
He is married, and became a
father only a month ago. He
works as a carpenter and cabi-
net maker for Hahn’s furniture
company. He often has to work

when the team is practicing.

PETE SMITH
Soccer Go Braugh

He is making a great sacrifice to
play soccer. No scholarships-are’
offered here’ to play soccer. “He
plays,” Bemis claims, “simply be-
cause he loves the game.”

Pete’s love for soccer. was
nursed in his native land of the
Emerald Isle. When he was 18
years old he was a Junior All-

“LUCKIES ARE BETTER THAN MONEY,” says Dr. Frood (who gets paid in Luckies).
It's a fact that college students smoke more Luckies than any other regular.

Dear Dr. Frood: The other day my roommate and I

had an argument about the difference between tradi-

the basic difference between these two forms?

Art .-Major

DEAR ART: The examples above should settle your

argument. The portrait at left is traditional. The artist
has drawn Lincoln as he actually appeared. The par-
trait at right is modern. As you can see, the modern
artist has drawn Lincoln's great-great-grandson.

 

Dear Dr. Frood: My favorite brand is Lucky Strike. But
unfortunately I am left-handed. Why doesn't Lucky
Strike come out with cigarettes for left-handed people?

DEAR LEFTY: Left-handed Luckies
are available. Simply ask for
“Left-handed Luckies.” They
come in a white pack with a red
bull's-eye. The only difference be-
tween these and ordinary Luckies
is that you must always smoke
them while facing a mirror.
