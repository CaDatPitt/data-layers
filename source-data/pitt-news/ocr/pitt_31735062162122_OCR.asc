Posvar Report Clarifies Intramurals Study Ordered  
Student—Police Conflict 

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

The investigation into last
December’s student-police dorm
confrontation culminated last
week as the Chancellor’s select
committee declared the “initial
altercation” could have been

resolved without the arrest and .

subsequent prosecution of the
students involved.

In addition, the committee
recommended the dismissal of
charges against the students,
Deborah Chambers and Kevin
Cheveria, on the grounds the
dispute is strictly an intra-
University issue, ill-suited for out-
side deliberation.

Furthermore. a maioritv of the
panel’s members judged one
arresting officer’s response to the
situation as “excessive” and asked
for further inquiry into the conduct
of Patrolman Edward Foster.
Foster was later dismissed from
the department for excessive use
of force in a separate incident.

The probe attempted to clarify
the circumstances and sequences
of events surrounding the arrest of
Chambers and Cheveria on
charges of disorderly conduct,
simple assault, and resisting
arrest. The two students later
alleged the officers had used ex-
cessive force and brutality in their
handling of the encounter.

The committee’s report, which
Posvar maintained is not a

“judicial finding,” also submitted

. five proposls designed to avert

similar crises in the future.
According to the board’s official
reconstruction of the night’s even-
ts, the incident was precipitated by
an excessive noise complaint from
Elaine Giarrusso to her Resident
Assistant (RA) Allison Herman.
Herman proceeded to Giarrusso’s
room to investigate the complaint.
The panel noted this was only one
of a series of such grievances and
that it “should have been resolved
long before December 1 by
stronger efforts to mediate the

A dispute or...by a suitable room

 

change.” ,

Chambers, whose room was the
source of the noise, arrived at
Giarrusso’s room following a
telephone call from the latter, and
an argument broke out among RA
Herman, Giarrusso, and Cham-
bers. The police were summoned
and Cheveria soon joined the alter-
cation. From this point on, the
board received varying accounts
of what followed.

The committee contended
“prudence would have indicated
the calling of the University Police

was premature” and that the face-

to-face encounter, suggested by
Herman to Giarrusso, did little to
molify the animosity between the
parties. -

When Officer John Remmen ap-
peared, Cheveria engaged Rem-
men in what the officer alleges was
“loud and obscene language” and
pressed him against the wall.
Cheveria, who admitted he was in-
toxicated, maintained he was only
attempting to gain Remmen’s at-
tention, while Chambers sought to
intervene between the two men.

A struggle ensued as Remmen
informed Cheveria he was under
arrest, and when Officer Anthony
Glowczewski arrived, the two were
forced to subdue Cheveria. At this
point, other policemen appeared,
including Foster who attempted to
restrain Chambers. The com-
mittee concluded the officer’s con-
duct with regard to her was, at
best, “questionable.”

On the basis of its investigation,
the committee decided there was
probable cause for the arrest of the
two students, although such cause

Synthetic Turf Examined

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

An ad hoc committee ordered by
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar is
being formed to study Pitt’s in-
tramural system, Dr. Ray Coble,
the Chancellor’s executive
assistant announced last week.

Intramurals is a deep concern of
Student Government and the ad-
ministration, Coble said, and the
committee intends to look into
possible short and long range
plans.

Two students, three ad-
ministrators, and seven professors
are on the new committee which
will, according to Coble, “review
the recreational and intramural
sports” and make recom-
mendations ‘_‘to increase the ser-
vices and opportunitiesgprovided. ”

Many persons were chosen by
Posvar because they had been
vocally critical of the existing

- system and had ideas of their own

they would like to see im-
plemented, Coble said.

The committee will study long
range plans such as building a
specific intramural or all-purpose
facility, perhaps on the old Forbes
Field site.

Student Government President
Mike Furick, who was chosen as a
student representative, shared
Coble’s ideas about the com-
mittee’s purpose, and offered a
short-range proposal.

Furick’s plan allows Pitt studen-
ts to check out, with an ID_and
driver’s license, personal athletic
items such as bicycles and tennis
racquets.

“Dr. Moye (Vice-Chancellor of
Student Affairs) told me he
thought a lot of people around here
were getting flabby,” Furick said.
adding perhaps more students
would get involved with these
types of items available.

Pitt /vlDs Research Foot

Physicians from Pitt’s Medical
School recently reported research
findings on college football injuries
relating to synthetic playing sur-
faces and to the high incidence of
lower back pain among interior
linemen in college football.

James H. McMaster, MD,
assistant professor; Carl L. Stan-
tiski, MD. teaching fellow; and
Robert J. Ferguson, MD, research
fellow, members of the Depart-
ment of Orthopedic Surgery.
presented their findings at the an-
nual meeting of the American
Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons
in Dallas, Texas.

In discussing injuries related to
synthetic playing surfaces, Stan-
tiski noted the turf increases
players’ running speed, thus set-
ting the stage for higher collision
forces and more serious injuries.
On the average, running time was
reduced .2 seconds on a straight

Furick hopes the idea would
generate more enthusiasm for
athletics and more students would
enroll in Pitt’s intramural
program. He said with added in5
terest in intramurals, avidness in
varsity sports would grow also.

“I’m really looking forward to
working on Coble’s committee,”
Furick said. “I think we can get
some definite solutions to some of
the problems.”

Consideration should be given to
the idea of moving Intramurals out
of the "athletic department, Furick
said, “because they can't direct
maximum attention to this
problem.”

,If the program was under
Student Affairs instead, Furick
said “it would be the only athletic
program to watch over and they
could give it that maximum at-
tention.”

The committee members were
chosen by the Chancellor last week
and all but three have accepted the
offer to study intramural
questions.

Those contacted by Posvar
were: Dr. Ray Coble, Marigold

Two campus student
organizations working within the
Democratic and Republican par-
ties in Pittsburgh have elected new
presidents.

elected president of College Young
Democrats (CYD) said her

organization would continue to,
have influence in local and‘
national politics. i

“We’ve been fortunate to play a .
role at all three levels of govern-
ment (local. state, and federal).’—’
Nelson said. “We’ve been lucky- _
the county chairman listens to our 
positions.”

Doug Yauger, president of the"

said his group had nearly died out
in the past three years in the wake 
of a youth shift to the Democratic 3 '
party.

“Although the Republican party-
is a little more conservative our
group covers the whole spectrum
politically,” said Yauger.
“Basically, Republicans lean to’ '
smaller government, less govern- ,'
ment control.” _

Yauger commented that his
group still had difficulty getting
feedback from the Republican
system, but felt the situation was
improving.

“We’re getting our com-
munication out,” Yauger said.-

“The key is youth and education,
the key is to know where you can
do your part.”

Nelson described a “love-hate
relationship” between the CYD
and the traditional Democratic
machinery. “This organization
works with politicians, you're not
going anywhere without them,”
Nelson said.

 PHILADELPHIA AP--The Penn-
-.4 sylvania Lottery is a bad gamble
according to Consumer Reports
magazine. The publication took a
up long look and found that if you're
.going to gamble, try something
besides the lottery.

Consumer Reports is a monthly
',publication which tests and rates
products.

The magazine said that a friendly
fame of poker is the best risk.
That’s because all the money put
into the game comes back to the
players. "But, the magazine says, in
the state lotteries, only about 40
H cents of every dollar comes back to
A the players.

By comparison, the roulette
I wheel at Monte Carlo gives back

87.3 cents for every dollar bet. And

the neighborhood bookie will

return about 95.5 cents on the
..dollar--to the winners.

The magazine states that even
playing the numbers is a better bet
than the lotteries. _

One merit was found. A person
buying a 50 cent lottery ticket each
week is hardly likely to endulge in
taking desperate plunges on the
lottery which would lead to
ﬁnancial trouble.

Five states--including Pennsyl-
Vania--currently offer a top prize of
$1 million for a 50 cent investment.

The magazine claims that pro-
moting lotteries has an excessive
cost. It says that the cost of
collecting one dollar of taxes is less

- than two cents. But it claims that
lottery expenses often run as high
as 40 cents _for each dollar taken in.

‘Consumer Reports’ Claims

Pa. Lottery Bad Gamble

But ofﬁcials of the Pennsylvania
Lottery say it isn't so. Henry
Kaplan, the executive director of
the state's lottery says the cost of
running it is just 5.3 cents out of
every dollar.

The magazine says that the lottery
contributes only a tiny fraction of
the state’s budget--less than four
per cent. But Kaplan argues that
even though the Pennsylvania
Lottery contributes just 1.5 per
cent, that still represents $60
million.

Money from the Pennsylvania
Lottery goes to finance programs
for senior citizens.

According to Consumer Reports
the real winners in state lotteries
are politicians. The magazine says
that the lottery allows the political
party in power to set up an office to
administer the lottery, and that
means more jobs for supporters.

Regional improvement goal

Community Institute Organized

BY MATTHEW KAMBIC

A Community Development In-
stitute, dealing with the physical,
environmental, economic, and
social development of the Pit-
tsburgh region, has been
established by the University.

“This is an attempt to serve the
people of this region with ad-
ditional opportunities for com-
munity leadership,” said Dr.
David H. Kurtzman, president of
the Institute and acting dean of
Pitt’s Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs.

Kurtzman and Pitt Professor
John P. Robin were the catalysts
behind creation of the new in-
stitute. “Our purpose is to form a
nucleus of people involved in
regional development who we can
bring together to learn from, and
to extend to these people the in-
formation others can provide,”
said Robin.

Kurtzman said Robin and he
were “reviving their own interest

in Pittsburgh's community af-
fairs.”

The Institute listed its objectives
as improvement of the en-
vironmental quality of the region,
the strengthening of its economic
base, the promotion of its social
eomity, and the enlargement of the
opportunities open to all its people.

The initial program of the In-
stitute will be a seminar course for
community development
executives and planners.

According to Robin’s office,
“The governing board of the In-
stitute drew up’ an invitation list of
about 50 people employed in gover-
nmental, public, and private sec-
tors of the Pittsburgh region.
People in fields of education, tran-
sportation, economics, health,
welfare, adn the environment
were included.”

These people will be invited to at-
tend weekly sessions including
guest speakers and informal group
discussions.

Pitt's MDS Research Football Injuries

(Continued from Page 1)
sprint and .24 seconds running a
zig-zag pattern.

The increased speed coupled
with the increase in players’
weight--11 percent in the last 30
years--has swelled the collision for-
ce by about 13 percent on the syn-
thetic turf, according to the study.

It was also noted that two types
of synthetic turf, Astro and Tartan,
absorb ten percent and four per-
cent less energy on impact, respec-
tively, than did Poly Turf or

natural grass.

The research project also
evaluated the forces needed to
overcome the friction created at
the interface of a football shoe and
the turf. The common practice of
wetting down the synthetic surface
prior to a game does not generally
eliminate the friction. Tests per-
formed indicate Poly Turf
required the greatest amount of
force to initiate shoe motion,
followed by Astro Turf, Tartan
Turf, and natural grass.

There is a high incidence of
lower back pain among interior
linemen--ends, tackles, guards and
centers. According to Ferguson,
the three-point and four-point stan-
ces assumed by the linemen put a
great deal of stress on the bony
spinal column.

In this position, the lower back is
bent and, at the same time, the
spine at the neck is bent and stret-
ched so the player can look ahead.
From this stance, the players drive
forward and upward, colliding in
an attempt to push back the op-
posing lineman. The lower spine
absorbs much of this collision for-
ce.

Varied injuries may result, in-
cluding a fracture of the arches of
the lower vertebral column; spon-
dylolysis, a lack of fusion between
two sections of vertebra; or spon-
dylolisthesis, a deformity of the
spinal column caused by vertebra
slipping forward in relation to the

back wall of the pelvis.

“There will be 12 sessions in the
first phase starting this Thursday.
and 14 sessions in the second phase
to begin this fall. Each session will
cover a particular topic,” a
spokesman for Robin said.

The opening session will be en-
titled “The Pittsburgh Region; a
Profile of its people and
economics.” George A. Ferguson,
assistant director of the South'-
western Pennsylvania Regional
Planning Commission, will discuss
demographic projection, and Nor-
man Robertson seniore vice-
president of Mellon National Bank,
will talk about the economy.

In addition to its seminars, the
Institute may sponsor public
forums related to the issues of
community development,
disseminate relevant information,
and secure the publicaton of both
scholarly and popular papers
relating to its areas of interest.

both the CYD and the CYR raise
their own political funds, in-
dependently from the Democratic
and Republican Parties, with sup-
port for non-partisan projects
coming from Student Government.

Both Nelson and Yauger claimed
the major function of their groups
was to infuse a youth—oriented
aspect into traditional politics.-
“Po1itical education is the crux of
getting responsible citizens,”
Nelson said.

Yauger commented the present
parties were not doing the proper
job of educating the people they
were serving about the political
function of the parties.
“Education and youth,” said
Yauger, “it’s got to be the young
people that learn how to use the
government system.”

The Truth About Waterbeds

Waterbeds represent an exciting and serious improvement over the old fash-

gienic values of the waterbed for many years. When sleeping on a waterbed
your back, shoulders and hips -receive total floatation support. Body weight is
distributed more evenly than is possible on any conventional bed, making a
v waterbed the most comfortable and

}healthful sleeping surface available.

Posvar Report Clarifies

Student-Police Conflict

(Continued from Page I)

did not imply any guilt by any
means. The board felt there had
only been a departure from the
student code of conduct not groun-
ds for arrest. The students’
violation of the criminal code oc-
curred only after the campus
police intervened. Thus, the
arrests and criminal proceedings
could have been averted, ac-
cording to the report.

In the board’s judgement, the in-
cident should have been “resolved
within the Universty community.”

The five safeguards which the
committee formulated to prevent
future similar incidents were:

--the introduction of a system to
educate students regarding their
legal rights;

--greater attention devoted to
housing students with the same
habits and preferences in the same
areas;

--the training of Resident
Assistants in -their capacity as
mediators, enabling them to better
settle inter-student disputes;

--a revamping of the ad-
judication process so as to allow
third-party mediation when
necessary;

—-greater emphasis placed on the
dual role of the campus police for-
ce as not only enforcers but as ar-
biters and peace-makers.

The panel suggested the police
force be divided intotwo units: “a

Tape Library Organizes

Departmental Information

ilnifaorination about different
departmental majors within the
University is more accessible sin-
ce the opening of a career tape
library at the Counseling Service.

Dr. Penny Crary, a coordinator
of the library said, “Students who
haven’t decided what they’re going
to major in and are just looking in-
to different things don’t have to go
around from department to depart-
ment. They can come to one place,
the tape library, and find out about
majors in different departments.

“The most valuable thing about
the tape library is that it's a time-
saving device,” Crary said. “A
student can come here and listen to
the tapes on his own free time
without setting up an appointment.
Also, I don’t think professors will
take the time on an individual
basis to go into the detail they go
into on the tapes.

“Anyone in the University can
use the tape library. All that’s
necessary is that the student or
faculty member bring a ID card
and that’s only so we can keep

track of the tapes and recorder
equipment.”

There are 30 tapes of interviews
with department heads discussing
their programs. Also available are
tapes of professionals explaining
their careers.

The philosophy of the depart-
ments, a view of the job market,
and career possibilities are some
of the areas explored.

   pa/f-truths

Dear Editor:

The article “Do Pitt Athletes
Receive Preferential Treatment?”
 full of half-truths and ﬂagrant
nnuendos.

j The author, Larry Pansino, has
itherbeen misinformed or has
eliberately twisted the facts to his
lilting. One half-truth deals with
raining table. Only football
rgreceives better food while the other
thletes eat the same, warmed-
,over,Szabo dinner. However, the
' ootball training table allows only
poiie portion while the cafeteria
: allows the students as much as they
wish. Hence, one can eat much
jinore in the cafeteria. Another
alf-truth deals with meals on
‘Saturdays. These meals are served
'‘only to the traveling football squad
 Conley’s Motel in Monroeville,
where they had spent the previous
;night. This breakfast is part of
_Conley’s catering service--not the
University’s.

The derogatory connotations
begin with the quote “fixing” of
This statement is
unfounded, which makes it slan-
derous not only to the athletic
department but also to all
rofessors teaching athletes. Next
..are the quotes taken from trainer
'lTim Kerin and Mike Carey.

have heard his information second-
hand or construed quotes out of

 I'm unsure why this “cheap-
shot” was taken at the athletes.

Letters to the Editor 

Major college athletics is a job for
each athlete that is physically
demanding and requires much
time. Better food is only a minor
consideration paid for by the fruit
of each athlete's labor. It’s very
caustic to us athletes when a poor
piece of journalism is published
against us.

So excuse me, Mr. Pansino, but
your credibility is showing (or
missing),

Sincerely,

Preferential?

Dear Editor:

I am writing in response to a
three-part investigative article
written by Larry Pansino which .was
recently featured in the Pitt News.
The article. in short, was designed
to take issue with the so-called
privileged status of all scholarship
athletes at the University of
Pittsburgh. In viewing the articles
however, I found them to be a
somewhat amusing expose of the
analytic and literary short-comings
of Mr. Pansino. Designed to
provide an in-depth review of the
“scandalous" situation
surrounding Pitt athletics,,the work
of Mr. Pansino seeks to sensa-
tionalize and more importantly
prove his point by generalizing
across all athletes and all sports.

While I am sure that the truth of
Mr. Pansino’s statements regard-
ing the existence of grade-fixing,
dining benefits, etc. can" be
validated, I am also certain that
such privileges are not extended to
all scholarship athletes within the

Yes, this is indeed big-hearted of
me. To devote my talents so
selflessly to helping those Pitt
people who are so much less than 1.

One question remains in your
mind, I know. And that is, “Why

you. .”

Well, the fact is that the sweet 17

athlete on the track team. From
personal observations of past and
present team members who have
suffered from scholastic ineli-
gibility, I am affirmed in the belief
that Coach Banner [head track
coach] is running a 100% above the
table show.

In looking at the dining
privileges afforded to scholarship
athletes, I am also forced to point
out another discrepancy. Of all the
sports programs at Pitt, I can
positively assure you that it is
solely the members of the football
program who are fortunate enough
to cultivate such culinary satis-
faction.. The only difference
between the other sports and the
rest of the student body lies within
the time that the meals are served.

With regard to the literary
quality of Mr. Pansino’s work, I
feel that he sacrifices the quality of

his endeavor by the misuse of the-

term “student athlete.” Such a
term though I am sure is intended
to represent the “scholarship
athlete” canleasily be inferred to
describe any student- such as
myself who also participates in
athletics.

In closing, Iwould like to say that '

I value the goal of reporting which
Mr. Pansino was trying to effect. I
also recognize, however, the harm
that incomplete analysis of any
topic or program can have upon the
reputation‘ of my teammates all of
whom compete for mere love of
sport. ‘

Dear Editor:

This letter shall be short and to

the point. How can you as editor of
a responsible newspaper permit
such extreme, medically
unfounded statements be made in
large advertisements such as
appeared in your February 4
edition by Students for Human
Life? Granted they may have their
personal views on the subject of
abortion. but this does not give
them the right to promote their
fictitious accounts in a responsible
literary forum.
’ I urge you to follow this up by
your personally ‘contacting people
of your choosing from the School of
Medicine, Public Health, or any
local hospital performing obstet-
rical-gynecological- services. I
sincerely believe that your reader-
ship deserve the truth and not to be
frightened by the scare tactics of a
limited few and then let them make
their own minds up on the personal
matters regarding contraception
and abortion.

Finally, I urge you to investigate
where Students for Human Life are
obtaining the funding necessary to
purchase the several large adver-
tisements in your paper? Hope-
fully it is not from Student
Activities Fees and if not, from
where?

Strike

Dear Editor,

Last month the maintenance
workers struck the University of
Pittsburgh demanding, among
other things, higher wages to keep

"up with the sky-rocketing cost-of-

living.— After striking for twelve
days the workers forced the
University to raise their offer five
cents resulting in a seventy cents
an hour raise over three years.

However, this offer does not apply
to Maintenance One workers who
will receive an increase of only six-
ty-seven cents over three years.

"The University justifies this three

cent differential on the grounds
that Maintenance One workers do
not perform heavy labor as do the
other workers. It is interesting to
note that the majority of workers
in the Maintenance One category
are women and that no women are
employed at higher grade levels.
Further. these workers received
lower wages before the strike. The
new contract widens this gap.

The Office of Economic Op-
portunity has investigated the em-
ployment practices of the Univer-
sity finding that discrimination on
is a normal
procedure. We feel that the three
cent wage differential is another
example of Pitt’s illegal
discrimination against women.
We demand that all workers
covered under the ‘new contract
with the Service Employees In-
ternational Union be granted the
seventy cent increase and that all
discrimination on the basis of sex
be ended. . '

K/‘Rh

BY M. C. PILECKI

Back in 1966, French director
Claude Lelouch created a visually
lush, emotionally satisfying (if
dramatically weak) love story in A
Man and A Woman, capturing the
world’s heart and its box office
receipts.

Besides winning an international

audience, the film was critically
acclaimed and widely discussed,
particularly for its blending of
black and white with color. That
‘combination proved both
aesthetically pleasing and a joke
on all the intellectual critics who
sought to “interpret” this odd
method. Lelouch simply explained
that he was short on funds, had run
out of color and so finished his film
in black and white.

Well, seven years later, Lelouch

has looked at love again, not
forgetting his success formula nor
his jibes at the “intellectuals” with
Happy New Year. There’s a lot of
A Man and A Woman here, not only
in the film cuts that open the movie
but also in a general pervasiveness
that constantly reminds one of the
successful film.

This isn’t to say it’s a remake or
a sequel. Rather, it’s like the same
basic look at love seen. through
eyes that are now older, wiser and
more experienced. Most of the
film’s action--in flashback--takes
place in the same period, mostly in
Cannes. And there is one sequence
at a train station that reminds one
instantly of the former movie’s
climax. I .

But this time the hero is no
dashingly handsome ’Jean—Louis

i

Trintignant, nor is the heroine a
delicately sensual Anouk Aimee.
Those two were just the made-for-
each-other type.

But not this time around: The
hero is a squat—faced thief, a rather
“common” type Nino Ventura,
whose comparisons to the late

I _ Spencer Tracy are certainly un-

derstandable. The heroine this
time is the very strong, very
passionate and “cultured” type
Francoise Fabian. The two are
social opposites, the kind you
would hardly expect to find at the
fame party, let alone in the un-
commonly cohesive relationship
they do sustain.

And that is the core of the film.
The plot - starts with the New
Year’s parole of convicted robber
Simon (Ventura), who looks for his
long-time girlfriend Francoise
(Fabian) and his partner-in-crime
Charlie (Charles Gerard), who got
away with the loot. He waits in a
bar while trying to shake his police
“tail” (who want to find out what
happened to the stolen property),
-and remembers the heist that
brought him to this.

As “heist movies” go, this is a
pretty good one. It involves only
two men with Mission Impossible-
type disguises, thorough research,
meticulous planning, thoughtful
psychological handling and careful
timing. It certainly seems like the
proverbial perfect crime.

And it has none of the phony
seeming last-minute snafus that
usually botch this sort of thing.

9 Now obviously, if the film starts‘

out with the thief in prison, one

wasntperfect. The only flaw was
none of the expected oversights or
dramatic excuses, but simply a
piece of information the two
thieves could not be expected to
know about.

And when Simon is bounced into
prison, the woman to whom he said
good—bye at a train station moves
to Paris to be near him and visits
him often. He met her in setting up
the robbery. Francoise, a twice
divorced, highly cultured
“liberated woman” ran an antique
[hop next door to the target jewel
store. Going to no small trouble,
expense and even risk (just like the
robbery), Simon makes a play for
her; only to strike out by using the
wrong words.

He meets her again at Christmas

midnight Mass, gets invited to din-
ner and finally wins her love by
being a cultural underdog in a
Iiscussion with Francoise’s
pseudo-intellectual friends. Here
Lelouch makes his play to jab at
the bourgeoise, their priorities and
morality.

His targets also include the
businessmen. Part of the robbery

' ﬂcheme relies on the greed of the

jewel shop’s manager, as Simon

oints out to his accomplice that

this robbery. Even Francoise, as a

member of the merchant class, is

elaborate pass at her.)

changes in the world from 1966,
without dwelling on the obvious.

So Simon wakes up after his long

things about himself, about Fran-

coise and about love. Happy New‘

heralded forerunner, but it has

“These are original research

Bobby Seale, co-founder of the
Black Panther Party, was here

last Friday to speak to a crowd of .

over seven hundred. in the Student
Union Ballroom. Preceeding the
lecture was a press conference in
which the media questioned Seale,
and following the lecture he made
a guest appearance on the'Marie
Torre show.

 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
         
  

Seale’s message was direct.
“Black brothers and sisters, stand
up and fight, defend yourselves by
any means necessary.” He em-
phasized that the black movement
of the late sixties is still alive and
well. ‘.‘The black revolution, in the
eyes of many, is dead. But, that’s
wrong. Only its character is
changing.”

in his natural habitat on Easttloth Street.

Co-chairman Seale made it clear
to his audience that “the media
didn’t advetise the positive points,
the real objectives of the party,
such as the breakfast programs,
protection for the elderly, draft
counseling and the campaign
againt police brutality, they in-
sisted on calling us radicals.”

In some ways Seale views his
role, and the role of the Panther
party as one of educating the
people. “We have designd and in-
stituted an ongoing educational
program so that the black com-
munity knows what is really hap-
pening.”

Seale discussed the objectives
and philosophy of the party and
presented a brief history...“Since
the founding of the Black Panther
Party in October 1966, it has gone
through many changes. But, the
Black Panther Party never was a
violent organization. The media
misrepresented much of what ac-
tually happened in the sixties.”

In a firm and vigorous fashion
Seale discussed his campaign for
mayor of Oakland as a grass roots
campaign that went to the people
at the factories, on the streets and
on the city buses. “We’d get up at
five am and ride downtown with a
leaflet team in front of us. I shook
more hands in three weeks than I'd
seen in an entire lifetime.”

But a major emphasis of Seale’s
speech was “Let Black people
decide what is best for the black
community.” Seale encouraged
cooperation with whites in the
community but added, “We don’t
need the kind of help where whites,
who are removed from the
problems, instruct blacks on how
to solve those problems.”

Several times during the speech
the crowd applauded spon-
taneously and the packed
Ballroom crowd gave a standing
ovation at the end of the lecture, as
Seale concluded “...the im-
plementation of our programming
through the collaboration of our
brothers andpsisters, is the fun-
damental tool in furthering the
goals of blacks in this country.”

 Rally Round Susan B.

BY FELICE NEWMAN

“A Call To Action” breezes from
the Cathedral wall. The All-

from a third floor window, and he’s
jeering. It isthe First Susan B. An-
thony Birthday Celebration, and
the cardboard signs that line the
pavement are not so different from
Anthony’s demands of decades
ago:

“Pitt Needs More Than A Major
Change” I

“End Sexism In The Classroom”

A band of women circle the area
in front of the Bigelow entrance to
the Cathedral, led by a bass drum.
The dozens of placarded thoughts
are accompanied by voices.
“Move on over or we’ll move on
over you.”

The stinging and picketing ends
as Karen M._ Clay, Women’_s Un-
dergraduate Union member, stan-
ds above the dry fountain,
microphone in hand. Her voice is
strong and loud, although the
singing had been almost unheard.
The bass drum emphasizes her
thoughts.

“Radical: Feminism is called
‘radical’ because it is struggling
to bring about really fundamental
changes in our society...” The tone
of the hour settles down. It
becomes serious in the same way
that Susan B. Anthony was serious.
Students passing by begin to
gather. The All-American Male is
silent at his third floor window.

I clutch my half frozen hands

“We as students have no
established means of recourse
upon a professor in any situation
deemed by us as sexist...” Tina
Adachi begins to speak. She is
speaking of opposition that women
must face. Martin P. Mullin, State
Representative from Philadelphia,
is the man. Mullin, whose cam-
paign slogan is “Under God’s Ban-
ner,” will be the figurehead in the
statewide elections of 1974. Adachi

says he is anti—divorce, anti-
contraceptives, but most
damaging to women, anti-
abortion.

Adachi stresses abortion will re-
surface as a main issue in the
coming elections. She says,
“Mullin will try to take away the
right won by women in January
1973—the right to control their
bodies.

“Attitudes have not changed in
100 years,” she concludes. A bed-
sheet flapping in the Friday af-
ternoon wind is confirming that
remark. Susan B. Anthony’s name
scrawled in bright letters is our
reminder. And the celebrational

rally is the evidence.

happiness

BY ADRIAN MCCOY

The Pittsburgh Poor Players’
production of Arthur Kopit’s
“Indians” demythologizes the
good old Wild West, depicting it as
p fraudulent sham based not on
heroism but on greed.

“Indians” is built on the episodic
structure of the traditional shoot-
’em-up western. This is an in-
verted western, though; for once
the Indians are the good guys and
the white men are the bad guys.
The good vs. evil conflict is still as
cut and dried as in the old western
movies.

The Indians here are all sen-
sitive, nature loving innocents; the

is a dead cowboy

white men come off as blind and
clownish. We see all the govern-
ment’s broken promises. the sen-
seless slaughter of the buffalo and
seizure of the land, and the
systematic extermination of large
humbers of Indians. The govem-
ment takes refuge in semantic rid-
dles like, “There’s always
‘someone who calls an over-
hhelming victory a ‘massacre.”’
The white men treat the Indians as
children at best and as animals at
worst. The one of the script is vin-
dictive. The audience feels guilty
under the full weight of “the white
man’s burden.”
The action centers around Buf-

and the media.

falo Bill Cody (John Dorish), who
is trying to help Sitting Bull (Dave
Ciummo) and his tribe negotiate
with the government for land
which has been taken away from
them. He is hopelessly trapped in
a conflict between two parties who
are so far apart that agreement is
hopeless. Cody spends most of his
time telling tall tales of his
prowess and looking unhappy
whenever someone is shot, which
happens quite often.

Dorish gives a fine performance
as Cody, torn between his frien-
ﬁlship for the Indians and a shaky
jense of patriotism, fluctuates bet-
ween defending the Indians to
making weak excuses for the
government. The rationalizations
he gives for the meaningless
massacres are some of his finest
lines. The words and actions are
defenses of government policy, yet
the way in which he delivers them
implies the opposite. He is sup-
ported by many fine performers.

The primitive set, in earthy
brown and rust-red, is suggestive
of the wild west mystique. The
rough props and burlap hanging
drops are reminiscent of a shady
travelling carnival that is set up
and knocked down in a hurry in or-
der to leave town quickly.’ The
result is a bizarre mixture of fun
and horror, ‘the carnival at-
mosphere, which fits in well with
Kopit’s script.

Several stock devices are used
effectively. Vaudeville routines
are inserted at crucial moments to‘
provide relief. The play-within-a
play technique is used, with two
very white Indians who turn out to
be Europeans, this is good for a
laugh. Cinematic flashback
sequences and freezing of action
heightens the intensity of climactic
moments. - . .

As in most social problem
dramas, the viewer is provided
with a certain objective distance
from the action._ The audience is
spoken to,_the audience sees the

_ scene change, corpses sit up and
g All these ~-
things are designed to‘ create a '

deliver long speeches.

distance that lets the viewer take it
all in.

Yet, disparate elements are .
used: One scene is a performance‘ -
of the Indian sun-dance ritual. The I *
but  I

episode is beautiful,
produces the opposite effect. It

pulls the "audience ‘in on a purely '

emotional level, creatinga high-
intensity emotional release, which’
cancels out some of the mental
discomfort that has been carefully
builtup.

Underlying the text is the A

problem of imitation vs. authen-
ticity. Buffalo Bill runs a wild west
show where cowboys and Indians
perform “the reality of im-
perishable deeds.” But things of-
ten go out of control. Mere sen-

cationalism turn into real violence.

and the pretense exploits the

reality. Cody realizes this and.

when he is faced with a man
disguised as himself who will
travel the country as Cody and

double the profits of the same-

show, Cody finally responds with

- honesty-he kills his double. . _
“Indians” is a sensitive and per- I .

ceptive treatment of the tragic
history of the American Indian.

YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO-—The
seventh-ranked Pitt basketball
squad tied the 1927 Pitt team’s
record of 21 consecutive victories
last Saturday night but not before
they received a dreadful scare
from the Youngstown State
College Penguins.

The very young Penguin squad
played inspired basketball before a

ggsellout crowd of 5,120 exuberant
' ‘fans in Beeghly Center but were

outclassed in the second half as the
Panthers recorded a 91-71 win.

Once again it was junior college
transfer Lew Hill who supplied the
spark the Panthers needed to_ keep
their machine rolling. After
Youngstown grabbed the lead
early in the second half 41-10, 41-40,
Hill went to work hitting nine of fif-
teen shots from the field while
pulling down five rebounds. At one
point he hit four shots in a row
pulling down five rebounds. At one
point he hit four shots in a row
enabling Pitt to open up a 57-47
lead which the Penguins could not

“overcome.

 After Hill’s big splurge to open

the second half the Panthers set-
tled into their tenacious defense.

The inexperienced Penguins soon
became tattled giving the ball to
the Cats. for easy lay-ups. The
“Butchers of Beeghly” couldn’t

slow the Panthers and were forced '

to resort to a physical type of
defense which only led to ‘their

. downfall. They committed ten per-

sonal fouls in the second half to

only one for the Panthers as they
handed Pitt the win.

It was obvious from the opening

~~ tip that Pitt would have to play a

~ near perfect game in order to keep

Edge Orange, 27-20

their streak alive. The Cats grab-
bed the early lead on the strength
of Mickey Martin’s jump shot and
lay-up. But, Youngstown came
right back to tie the score at 4-4 as
the Panthers were called for five
quick fouls.

The Panthers again went to work
with Kirk Bruce and Tom Richards
hitting from the outside to raise the
score to 14-4. The Penguins con-
tinued to battle as junior Phil
Gaston hit several shots in close to
bring his team back to a 14-12
deficit. The two teams continued
to trade baskets until Pitt finally
called time out with ten minutes
remaining in the half.

Keith Starr and Ken Wagoner
now entered the game for Pitt
initiating a full court press. But
Youngstown had no trouble getting
the ball upcourt fighting back to a
22-22 tie. The Panthers were
unable to get any breathing room
as Gaston continued to work inside
for the easy lay-ups and freshman
Gary Anderson hit from the out-
side.

The shooting of Billy Knight was
the only thng that kept the Pan-
thers in the game. He scored
eighteen points in the first ahlf ,
most of his shots cming from the
ouuside. The hostile Youngstown
fans found it diffucult to keep from
applauding his efforts as. he hit
from all over the court.

With Kight bombing away from
the outside and Gaston matching
him basket for basket on te other
end of the floor the two teams bat-
tled throughout the first half. Pitt
was not able to gain more than a
three point advantage at any point
and finally went to the locker room
with a 40-39 edge. '

squeaked out a 21-20 victory over
Syracuse at the Field House Satur-
day.

Rande Stottlemyer, a 126—pound
freshman, pulled off a superior
decision over Syracuse’s Guy
Dugas by ten points,-the minimum
margin required to get that extra
team point.

Now 12-4, the Sharpsville, Pa.

throughout the match, picking up
13 points to his opponent’s three.
All of Dugas’ points came on
escapes.

varsity match came through for
Pitt in a different way. George
Soergel, a 134-pounder, constantly
struggled to avoid getting pinned
by Syracuse’s John DeBiase, and
when it became apparent to the
Orangemen that Soergel would not
be pinned, he went for a superior
decision.

DeBiase would score two points
by taking down the 7 North

let him up, giving Pitt one point.
DeBiase needed to do this four
times in the third period to get a
superior. \

A truly good team will remain
calm under pressure which is
exactlyiiwhat the Panthers were
able to do. They hit over 50 per
cent of their shots in the second
half while Youngstown was shoot-
ng only 40 per cent. They stayed
waay from the‘ costly fouls ad
played the type of defense that has
been their strng point all season.
As a result the inspired Penguins
fizzled on offense as the Panthers

' Morgan built up some riding time.

By the time Roba escaped

Pitt’s gymnstics team continued
their steady improvement, as
evidenced by their fine showing in
losing to Syracue University Satur-
day afternoon, 152.35 to 135.30.

The youthful Panthers received
Rob Pasterick’s best effort of the
year, the freshman scoring 47.40

points to pace the all-around men_.
Pasterick thrilled a sparse crowd
with several good routines, saving
the best for last with a stunning
dismount from the high bar.

Gus Papantonio of Pitt followed
the Orangemen’s Ange Robinson
as third best all-around man, com-
piling 37.55 points.

Syracuse’s strength came
mainly on one gymnast’s ex-
cellence in a particular event. Jay
DiFulvo entered only the high bar,
and paced the field with 9.2 points.
Orangeman Greg Collis was far
superior in the pommel horse to
anyone else, scoring 9.3.

Other Orange stalwarts were
Dan O’Connor, who averaged 8.75
in his three events and Rick
Wagner, who won the floor exer-
cise and long horse vault with a 9.2
and 9.3 respectively. ,

First year Pitt coach Ig Perez
was pleased with the meet’s
results. “We were cleaner than
we’ve been and we kept up the
momentum and support we need
from the guys.”

Perez continued, “With Steven-
son in there at all-around (fresh-
men Don Stevenson, limited to one
event due to a neck injury,) we
could have scored in the 140’s.”

Stevenson is expected to com-

 

night when the Panthers host South
Connecticut at 7:30 in the Trees
Hall gym. ,
Syracuse Coach Paul Romero,
who has seen his team score higher
this year in the past eight, was
lavish in his parise of Pitt’s
blooming gymnastics program.
“Pitt is building now and will get
better with time," Romero said,
“Thev should be a real threat in
the East in‘two or three years.”
Perez has brought the teams

overall point total up ap-
proximately thirty points from last
year. This factshould be con-
sidered much more importantly
than Pitt’s failure to win a meet.

A listless crowd finally came to

Roba started the third period on

GOOD UNTIL MARCH 1

Boyd Leads Cub
Win Over Penguins

BY DAVE F OUST
YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO—-The Pitt
junior varsity continued its win-
ning ways as they easily handed
Youngstown State University its
fifth loss in seventeen outings, 82-
71.

It was the junior Panther’s size
advantage that gave Pitt the
momentum to move out to an 18-14
advantage with 11:55 remaining in
the first half. The junior Panthers
casually traded fifteen to twenty
foot jumpers with the little
Penguins as both clubs worked for
percentage shots.

Wayne Talbott and Mark Disco
demonstrated that big people at
Pitt are fine outside shooters too,
as they made the nets jump from
the base line.

Youngstown gradually began
ito lose its outside shooting poise.
missing many second shots while
Pitt rebounded relatively well
sustaining their deliberate style of-
fense.

It wasn’t Pitt’s deliberate style
of play that was responsible for 40
of their 42 first half points. The of-
ficial and referee called two (2)
fouls in Pitt’s favor in the first half,
one of which was a dribbling
on Penguin guard Robin Cera, the
other was a shooting foul in which

sophomore guard Bob
Shrewsburry converted both at-
tempts.

The full court press was of little
advantage to Pitt as Youngstown
guards Robin Cera and Matt
Maresh matched the efficiency of
Panther ball control ace Bob
Shrewsburry. The half ended 42-
34, Pittsburgh advantage.

The second half began in identity

with the first half, officiating and
all. Humorous rumors were cir-
culating the press table that
maybe, just maybe someone was
paying the officials off. Counter
rumors ran ‘to the effct that
perhaps these “officials” could
have been escaped convicts from
the nearby city jail, the only real
difference being verticle rather
than horizontal stripes.

The issue was finally settled
when a rather dignified female fan
sitting behind the press table
remarked to her escort, “Those
two officials must be jokers!”

It was Pitt’s Frank Boyd who
came out dealing a sixteen point
second half effort that highlighted
Boyd's quickness in a medley of
soft hoods and one dribble layups,
keeping the Panther scoring
machine pigoductive.

Youngstown began to pressure
the ball all over the court but to no
success as Pitt opened their lead
from eight to eleven points and
substituted freely. Youngstown
could not 'cut the margin as coach
Fran Webster concentrated on
coaching the full court press which
he obviusly felt should have wor-
ded but didn’t.

Pitt got its second chance to
shoot a foul shot with 10:53
remaining in the contest. It was a

_ BY YAIER LEHRER

There is almost no doubt that in
one or two years, Pitt’s mermen,
predominantly freshmen and
sophomores, will be virtually un-
beatable. The question, though, is
how good are they right now. . The

answer is plenty good. I )'

One thing remains unanswered,
though. Are the tankers good
enough to defeat the Golden
Flashes of Kent State in Wed-
nesday night’s meet at seven
o’clock at Trees Pool.

It was only last year that the
Panthers had written off the Kent
State meet as just another loss, but
a1l’of a sudden there is room for op-
timism. This year, the Panthers
have displayed strength equal to
that f every one of their opponents,
scant seconds separating a win
from a loss, making thei r record 5-
2 so far for the season.

And although there is plenty of

room for optimism about the outﬁ>

come of this meet, optimism, as
always, must give way to realism
so that Pitt’s chances can truly be
evaluated. It is true that there has
been an unbelievable amount of
improvement in this year's team,
but whether or not that im-
provement is enough remains yet
to be seen.

“If we beat Kent Stae this Wed-
nesday, there is no question but
that it will be an upset,” Coach
Bradshaw, who only three weeks
ago made the same remark con—.

cerning the Maryland team before 6

the Cats outswam them.

If the Panthers have one glaring
weakness, it is in the free-style
events, of which, unfortunately for

Diamonds are a girl’s best
friend, or so they say and Pitt’s
women’s basketball team would
not refute such a statement. Main-
taininga slight lead going into the
final minutes of the second quar-
ter, the women switched from a
man—to-man defense to the new
_;‘diamond” defense and easily

K defeated West Liberty Friday, 51-

37.

“The purpose of the defense,”
explained Coach Sandy Bullman,”
is to trap the ball. It forces bad
passes around the key.” The
defense is essentially a 1-2-2, with a
point man chasing the ball. The
quickness of the girls proved to be
their most effective weapon as
they chased West Liberty right off
the court.

The first half was a nip and tuck
battle with the women Panthers
going into the lockerroom at half-
time leading 23-14. The women
came out in the second half
weaving and picking and dribbling

;.,Less. They moved the ball quickly

I .1"om side to side, finding the open
man for the score. Bullman sub-
stituted freely throughout the third
and fourth quarter when the game
was put out of reach.

Mary Ellen Klobchar led all
scorers with 17 and Sue Tweardy
was close behind at 11. Bullman
cited the fine performance of
freshman, Terri Tunie, as a factor
in the victory. ;

“Terri is beginning to come
around. She’s an excellent ball
handler and will probably be the
leader of the team next season.”

Bullman went on to say that she
was very excited with the team’s

they will continue to improve
throughout the remainder of the
season.

but disolaved awesome power in
the final two events, capturing fir-
dt. second and third in the balance
, “rl floor exercise.

Senn..- Donna DeMarino and
Becky Zuccarelli competed in the
final home meet for the women’s
gymnastics team. Kathy Krynock,
a steady performer in the vaulting
and uneven parallel bars, suffered
an injury Thursday morning while
practicing a routine.« exercise on
the uneven bars. She required six
stitches in her chin and was very
disappointed that she could not
compete in the final home meet.

Donna DeMarino, the most con-
sistent performer for the squad
this year, maintained her winning
ways as she capture two firsts, a
lecond, and a third. Sheila Barber,
yho has come on strong in the last
two weeks of competition, cap-
tured first place with a beautiful
allowing on the balance beam.

The meet was delayed due to the
failure of officials to show up.
Coach Debbie Wells explained that
the problem rests on the fact that
judges are not on a contractual
basis with the University for the
ﬂeets. The result is that judges
have failed to show for two meets.
“Another problem,” explained
Wells. “is the number of judges.

   

Ihere should be three to four
for each event. Today. as in our
other meets. there were only two.”
Wells will be disappointed to lose
the three seniors. “They’ve been
very patient with me,” explained
the first-year coach. “These
seniors have been the framework
of our team. The other members
have looked to them for leadership-
-and they've provided it.”
The girls (4-3) travel to Ohio

State for their final meet, Satur-,

day, with the guarantee of a .500
season.

‘the Pitt nem, there are a good
number. The Pittsters do have
some good free-stylers but lack the
depth in those events to be as
strong as they should be. John
Schepner provides the team with a
very good 200-yard race while
Mark Wallace does the saae in the
50-yard event. ”

And if there is one area where
the Golden ¢Flashes are strong,
it's in.the free-style races. The
KSU team has good men in the
50,100, and 200 yard-style events,
not to mention their great strength
in the 400 yard free relay. Jim
Devincentis provides the Golden
Flashes with an excellent free-
style stroke that makes him a
threat in any distance race.

“If we’re going to beat them”
remarked Bradshaw, “then we’re
going to have to do it in the stroke
events such as the fly and
backstrokes.

A lot is going to rest on how well
Mark Wallace and Carlos Santiago
do in the 200 yard backstroke and

how well Dave Natali and Larry
Rosa do in the butterﬂy stroke. In
order to keep Pitt in the running,
they're going to have to do some of
their best times.

John Templin will have his han-
ds full in the breaststroke against
Jeff Horvath and Larry Mon-
tgomery. So far this season, the
times of these swimmers have
been very close and the outcome is
a definite tossup.

“We’re strong enough not to be
afraid of them,” said Bradshaw,
“and although this is one of the
teams I don’t think we’d beat this
year, we still have a chance of
pulling off an upset.”

In the diving competition, the
Panthers have the upper hand.
Kent State has not shown much at
all in diving and were defeated by
the Cats at the Penn State Relays
earlier in the season. Tom Fatyol,
Jack Garrow, Hector Bas, and
Marin Staley should have a field
day with the Golden Flashes in
both the three and one meter
boards.

“Kent State hasn't shown anything
in the 1000-yard free-style yet,”
said Bradshaw, ”and I hope to be
able to do something there.” A lot
is going to rest on Jerry DeMuro
and Walt Young. If they can pull
out a first and second in the event,
then the rest of the meet should be
pretty close.

A lot of weight will rest on the
shoulders of each individual swim-
mer, in this meet more than any
other. One mistake could cost the
Panthers the meet and one ex-
cellent performance could win it
for them.

One event where a team effort is
called for is the 400—yard medley
relay, and a win in this event is a
must for the Cats to offset the
probable loss of thgfree relay. The
Pitt mermen lost that event last
year at Kent State, but the addition
of John Schepner and the maturing
of the others who were all fresh-

men last year could give the Cats a .

winning combination in that race.

  Bruins On Longest
Losing Streak

EUGENE, Ore. AP--UCLA is
working on its longest losing streak
in eight years and Coach John
Wooden admits the Bruins no
longer “deserve to be number
one.”

Wooden, whose team lost Friday’

night to Oregon State then again
here Saturday to Oregon, said,
“We are a fine team...but ob-
viously, there are some who can
beatus.”

The University of Oregon,
boosted by sniper-like outside
shooting of sophomore Bruce
Coldren, upset UCLA,56-51 Satur-
tlay. The night before, Oregon
State beat the Bruins 61-57.

The Oregon teams-both made
up mostly of freshmen and
sophomores-ironically were the
last two teams to deal UCLA back-
to-back defeats in 1966. The losses
were the first in the Pacific Eight
‘Conference in four years for
UCLA.

“We played a better game than
against Oregon State. Oregon just
did an excellent job,” Wooden said
after Saturday’s debacle.
“Coldren hit shots we gave up on
the press and they kept the ball
away from Bill Walton low. We
should have been able to take ad-
vantage of that. We didn’t.”
