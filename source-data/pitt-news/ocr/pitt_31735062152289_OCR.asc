Boxing, Pictures, Eats
Will Feature Social
Evening

 

The committee for the Engineer-
ing Association’s Smoker tonight in

Trees Gymnasium has planned sev-
eral features for entertainment that
include only members of the school
of engineering.

There will be a ﬁve-round heavy-
weight boxing match between R. J .
McDonald, E.E. ’31, and J. E. Con-
rad, Chem. Eng. ’31. A wrestlin
match between Bill Schindell, C. .
’32, and Earnest Thornton, M.E. ’31,
will prove interesting. Thornton is
the lightweight champion of the Al-
legheny Mountain Athletic Associa-
tion.

Dean Elmer A. Holbrook will pre-
sent the Sigma Tau Medal to the
student who made the highest scho-
lastic average in his studies as a

tion given by Alpha Omicron to the
student who. made the highest
scholastic average in his studies for
his first two years at the University.

The feature of the entertainment
for the evening will be movies——a
Mack Seniiett Comedy.

Another interesting event will be
the roasting of the wieners for the
“Hot Dogs” by passing an electric
current through them. When the
dogs are done they will pop open and
the current will immediately stop
ﬂowing through them. Several boys
will be chosen to roast one dog
apiece at one board. Fifty cents wil
be given to each boy who gets his
dog done first at his board.

 Pitt women first heard of Dr
 McConaughy, ‘whose talk is
. the most important feature of Wom-
* n;n’s Day, from their delegates to
the W. S. G. A. convention at Penn
~ State College last spring.
* Margaret Hall, Ed. ’31, and Naomi
jlﬁcson, Col. '31, then candidates
for the presidency of W. S. G. A., re-
; P, X I with an enthusiastic account
«iabout this eminent psychologist who
ﬁeld an entire ‘ convention - spellbound
q «for two and a half hours. ‘
j '_ is largely as a result of their
. experience that Josephine Blileg, Ed.
731, as chairman of W. C. . L.,
,_ made‘ the effort to secure Dr. Mc-
Qonaughy, who is to speak on “Un-
derstanding Ourselves.”
' , Referring to the psychologist’s
visit to the University today, Miss
Hall said: “Dr. Mcconaughy will
I  something for each one of us.
_From ‘the moment I heard her speak

 I Eminent Psychologist
I  After Hearing Talk

, ﬁsher brings us a message on ‘Mak-

University and Penn State College.
She was the consulting psychologist
for the Boston Psychopathic Hospi-
tal, Tauton State Hospital of Massa-
chusetts, and Harvard University
Ps cho-Educational Clinic. _

At present Dr. Mcconaughy is
also psychologist for Friends school
at Philadelphia, lecturer for the
Parents’ Council of Philadelphia and
for the Massachusetts Society of
Mental Hygiene, as well as adviser
in Mental Hygiene at Mount Holyoke
College and lecturer in psychology
at Swarthmore College.

In telling how we may understand
ourselves, Dr. McConaughy says:
“One of the troubles with human be-
havior is the marking system we
have been brought up on-_the idea
that we can get 100 per cent, which
implies you can be perfect. Life rep-
resents a learning curve idea that

age of twenty we should be grown
to a certain stage. There is an emo-
tional growth, just as there is an in-
tellectual growth. If we are grow-
ing year by year we are happy. If
we are not growing, we are not. So
there is no 100 per cent possible."

“Life is not arithmet1c—-not one
to one hundred,” she adds. “It goes
any direction, either way, right or
left. The question in life is one of
algebra-—-are you going to deal in
negatives or positives? We will all
deal in both. The ues-tion is, which
is going to win‘! y your attitudes
you are known-—‘as a man thinketh
in his heart, so is he.’ It is the way
you really think which colors your
whole action.”

Tyson who said that the drive was
principally an administration-faculty
drive which had nothing to do with
students. - S

a contribution of $500 donated by the
Mellon Institute Community Fund.
The entire fund of $5,550 was raised

nia Education Conference, which in-
cludes the Pittsburgh Teachers’ In-
stitute, the Western Convention Dis-
trict and the School of Education of
the University.

He. leaves his widow and two sons,
Bruce and Warren Alderman.

Chancellor John G. Bowman paid
the following tribute to Dr. Alder-

an.

“One of the most marked charac-
teristics of Dean Alderman was his
sensitiveness. In any work with his
colleagues he never failed to see
their point of view and interest. He
tied folk to him with affection. Fur-
ther, the man had the high respect
of his colleagues and of students in
the University for his judgement
and vision.”

Dr. S. B. Linhart, secretary of the
University said:

“Dr. Alderman occupied a con-
spicuous place among the leaders in
the ﬁeld of education. He was high-
ly esteemed by his colleagues in the
University and was very successful
in his work as dean of the School
of Education. His death in thema-
turity of his powers is not only a
great loss to the University, but also
to the work to which he rendered
such distinguished service.”

Dr. Anthony M. Goldberger, act-
ing dean of the School of Education
and associated with‘ Dr. Alderman
in the work of this school for sev-
eral years said: . ,

.. “In the death of Dean Alderman,
the students and faculty of the
School of Education have lost a
most able leader and an ever true
friend. The teachers of Western
Pennsylvania will miss his sympa;

I thetic understanding of their prob-

lems and needs. Those of us who
were closely associated with him
know that in his passing there has
gone out of this community a per-
sonality never failing in cheerful-
ness and kindness.”

 School Mourns Deaths

   

 

MR. ISAAC W. FRANK
(Continued from Page One)

the University of Pittsburgh in 1920.
Recently Mr. Frank presented to the
University a laboratory for class
technology in memory of his father.
Because of his desire to remain un-
ostentatious, Mr. Frank requested
that no information of this grant
be given until his death.

Mr. Frank was greatly interested
in philanthropic work and was a di-
rector in the Pittsburgh Association
for the Improvement of the Poor,
the Irene Ka fmann Settlement, the
Monteﬁore ospital, the Y. M. and
Y. W. H. A., the Federation of Jew-
ish Philanthropies and the Rodef
Shalom congregation.

He leaves his widow and three
children, all of Pittsburgh, Mrs. S.
J. Anathan, William K. and Robert
Frank. ‘

Dr. John G. Bowman paid a trib-
ute to his industrial activities in
saying: “In the industrial develop-
ment of Pittsburgh, Mr. Isaac W.
Frank was a general. His interest,
however, did not stop with business.
In a quietway the man gave much
time and money to various charities
in Pittsburgh. As a trustee of the
University, he was always a good
help and a good adviser.”

- r. Linhart, secretary of the Uni-
versity, said:

“Mr. Frank became a trustee of
the University in 1920. He was
deeply interested in the work of the
University and generous in his sup-
port. He actively assisted in pro-
moting its welfare in every possible
way. His judgment and his counsel
were highly esteemed by his asso-
ciates on the Board.”

Prominent Psychologist
Advocates Enthusiasm

“Can a man by taking thought add unto his stature one cubit?”
Perhaps not a cubit, but surely a fraction of an inch, by standing
erect or by stretching to his utmost capacity.

So it is with the inﬂuence of our emotions, which are partly
physical, and partly mental. An outburst of temper causes changes
in the body: increased pulse, more heat, more strength, so that We
may want to hit something, or alas! somebody. A hearty laugh
makes us feel better. When we are blue, we often put on that hang-

In the war time the song, “Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old
Kit Bag, and Smile, Smile, Smile!” was very popular. It was sound
psychology. Good healthy positive emotions are associated with in-
creased ‘bodily vigor, and vice versa. Note the expressions in our
everyday language: “stooped with grief,” “jump up and down with
joy,” “down at the mouth,” “cold with despair,” "the shambling gait,”
“the twinkling eye,” “the sad, melancholy glance,” etc.

’Tis -a poor rule that will not work both ways. And therefore
the courageous and plucky college student, who never wants to wear
his heart on his sleeve, will ﬁnd that if he acts an emotion long
enough he will begin to feel it, for he will ﬁnd plenty of associations
to reinforce him. When we feel blue, we tend to notice only the
things which make us bluer. On a discouraging day like that let us
stand in front of a mirror before we present our countenance before
the world. At the very least, if we have even a speck of humor left,
we will laugh at the melancholy face which we see there! And if we
laugh at ourselves, we are safe. Smiles and laughs are even more
contagious than diseases. If we have enough of the former, many of
the latter will be entirely eliminated, since health is increased by
buoyancy and enthusiasm, and joy in daily living.

Production Group Gives Three
One-Act’ Dramas

 

Carl Cass’ University play pro-
duction class successfully presented
the ﬁrst of a series of three one-
act plays on Wednesday evening,
November 26, at Frick Training
school auditorium.

The play-s, produced by student-di-
rectors, were John Galsworthy’s
“Defeat,” directed by Edward Bon-
ner, Col. ’32; Edna Ferber’s “The
Eldest,” directed by Marie Hoch-
muth, Ed. ’31, and Russel Medcraft’s
“His First Dress Suit,” directed by
Marie Wills, Ed. ’31.

The cast of “Defeat” included
Helen Brooks, Col. ’32, who took the
part of an expatriate German girl
who thought the war had madeher
heartless, and George Ta 101' III,
Spec, who played the ro e of a
young British officer who believed
he was ﬁghting to make the world
a better place in which to live.

“The Eldest” was the story of a
sister Who sacriﬁced all her own
pleasure to help her brother and sis-
ter after the invalidism of ‘their
mother. The part of the oldest sis-
ter was. realistically portrayed by
Dorothy Hargrave, Col. ’34. Rose,
the younger and gayer sister, was
played by Kitty Jane McCabe, Ed.
’33. The part of the father was
taken by Charles Spiegel, Col. '31,
and that of the brother by Em-
manuel Breakstone, Eng. ’34.

Henry, who broke the eldest sis-
ter’s heart, was played by Carl
Swartz, Col. ’34. The neighbor was
Virginia Shea, Ed. ’31.

_The third skit was entitled “His
First. Dress Suit,” and was most
amusing. . The audience’s sympathy
was all with Teddy, played by How-
ard Kleeb, Bus. Ad. ’34, when
Johnny, Charles Trextor, Col. ’33,
tried to take his dress suit from
him to wear at his wedding.

Betty was portrayed by Jane

' Nichols, Col. '34; her mother, by

Vilma Minardi, Col. ’31.

The production of these plays is
an effort on the part of Cass to give
his play production class practical
experience in directing and acting.

was cold and slippery. When they
were about half way to Pittsburgh
the chains broke and since one girl
had a father who owns a motor com-

home and buy the chains from papa.
So all the way back _and papa had
closed up for the night. Finally
after buying three sets of chains in
all, and spending hours on the road
they got to the dance and back. It
was worth the trouble—-—quote from

that it was worth the money. And
chains come high too, unless they

who was an exchangefellow at the
University in. Munich last year.

Just what a. German student does
during his college career seems to be
a matter of his own judgment. He
merely attends lectures and when he

comprehensive exam. If -he should

Scholarship Report
 The report of the Scholarship

Conference seemed _to explode the
foo ' that fraternity men’s social
~ ,v?fies interfere with their schol-

"in one hundred and twenty-ﬁve
iillstitutions, it was found that dur-
ing the 1929-30 academic year the
aivorage of the sixty thousand fra-
i-nit men under consideration ex-
eidecl the All Men’s average for the
tune ‘schools by .069706 of an inter-

Theodore M. Focke, dean of men

B-E-N-C-H

This is Sub-Station B-E-N-C-H
coming on the air by remote con-
trol through the courtesy of the Pitt
Weekly Sports department. Every
Friday at ten-thirty, you will search
eagerly for this column, and swear
because you can’t ﬁnd it.

Well, for one thing you can_’t get
the “dope” on the football gridders
anymore, because football season is
over. But I was ﬁguring on giving
you the “dope” on the basketball
team, but here's what happened.
Some of the bigger stations got
jealous because no one would tune
in on them while Sub-Station
B-E-N-C-H was on the air. They
used their inﬂuence (I don’t know
where they got it) on the Federal
Radio Commission and our license
was revoked because of exceeding
the wave length. It was necessary
for me to exceed it as my Aus-
tralian fans couldn’t hear me very
well on the old wave length. Some
of my radio fansh-ave already sent
in a petition to the F. R. C. and are
very anxiously waiting for results.

Coaches Easterners
Folks, I’ve got a big surprise for
ou. I have been invited by Andy
err to help him coach the Eastern-
ers for their annual game with the
Westerners on the coast. I guess
“Jock” must have been telling Andy
about my prowess. I was ﬁguring
on giving you the game through this
station but now it is impossible. By
going to this game, I am going to
be out of basketball for a few weeks
but when I get back, you folks will
see what a. demon I am on the floor.
You’ll forget there ever was such
a guy ‘as “Charley” Hyatt, even
though he was a pretty good bas-
ketball player.

The Lion walked into the trap me
and “Jock” set for him Thanksgiv-
ing Day, and we caged him. It was
a good game all around even though
the day was pretty cold. I didn’t
play because “Jock” said he was go-
ing to need me next year, and
there’s no use of taking any chances
on me getting hurt. I fooled a lot
of you folks there because you
thought I was going to say that
“Jock” was saving me for the ban-
quet,

How did you like those two nice
runs Heller got away. Well, “Jock”
said to me before the game that he
had a play up his sleeve that he
was ﬁguring on using with me car-
rying the ball, but since I wasn’t
going to play he ﬁgured that he
would let “Fats” Heller try it. And
did Heller do me ‘justice when he
got away for that eighty-yard run!
He had to as I told him before the
game that he would bring disgrace
on -my shoulders if he didn’t get
away, and besides he would be in
for a good beating. ’Eddie Hirsh-
berg and Ted Dailey sure took good
care of the terminal positions in the
absence of our two regulars, “Jim”
McMurdo and “Rip” Collins. Espe-
cially Dailey in the way he got un-
der all those punts. (Editor's note:
The copy reader did not correct
B-E-L-C-H's faulty English.)

A guy from the Penn State col-
le_ge paper had the nerve to call me
a half columnist, and also told me
that I was all wrong when I said
that Pitt had gone undefeated in the
odd playing “years.” If he will
kindly notice that I didn't say years
but seasons, he might make amends
for his mistake and also put me in
good graces with the Collegian
Sport staff. I am, Sub-Station
B-E-N-C-H, si ing off the air un-
til next footbal season.

“Apples, apples everywhere-——and
not an orange in sight.” Thus the
Ancient Mariner would have be-
wailed his fate had he suddenly
come back to pay us a visit. For
in these days of high tariffs, gang
wars, crime waves and Thanksgiv-
ing holidays, the little fruit which
as meant so much in the history of
the world holds sway once again.
Be this as it may, however, we
poor college students are content to
spend our hard earned nickels for
this fruit without thinking of the
worry it has caused. The Y.  C.
A. office, the Y. W. stand out in
the hall and the thousand and one
fruit vendors have suddenly been
rushed with an unusual amount of
business. And it isn’t because they
keep the doctor away, either. .
Watch a great big Senior attempt
to take a half ton bite off a three-
ounce apple while studying the
works of Sophocles or something
and you realize the height of some-
thing or other has been reached.
And if your memory still holds
look what the apple did in the gar-
den of Eden when Mother Eve

couldn’t resist the luscious fruit and
started a whole army of apple vend-
ors. Look what Paris started with
the apple in the beauty contest and
now the girls don’t amount to any-
thing unless they are “Miss McKees
Rocks,” or something.

And then watching the deteriora-
tion of the apple——to its present low
caste position—the shades of Jupi-
ter wail aloud. The same apple that
graced the banquet halls of Caesar
defiled on the typewriter desks of
the Weekly office. The same Wash-
ington brand that delighted Abra-
ham Lincoln wasted on the barren
oak tables of the Activities build-
ing. “Oh, death, where is thy
sting?”

The reason forthe present apple
eating epidemic is often laid to un-
employment—other times laid -to
just advertising—but if you should
ask a Pitt student he’ll reply, “Didn't
Augustus Caesar eat apples?” and
unless you took ‘Turner’s history
course you couldn’t answer. We have
come here to become great, they
say, and if apples are going to do
it, we'll not let them waste their
‘fragrance on the desert air.

“Whitewash  Disaster?”
“Never!” said the Editor:

C-R-A-S-H! The very earth seemed wrenched asunder by a
giant han Then dread silence; an ominous pause; fol- . ‘
lowed by a terrific inferno of destructive ﬂame and explosion: "

That frightful .-conflagration at the Denmark, New Jersey, .
government arsenal, took heavy toll of lives. The little town :
nearby was suddenly hurled into a maelstrom of terror, loss ’ ‘
- - : and federal investigations. - "

There was little justification for this calamity; hardly any ex-
cuse for the lack of protection to lives and property. But, Gov-
ernment investigations whitewashed all concerned-— until ; : s

The editor of Chem and Met investigated the smoldering
ruins. His report was not of the 5‘whitewashing” type. It
boldly set forth the facts—disclosed the lack of protective
measures--placed the blame directly where it belonged. And,
all through the bitter controversy which followed, this editor
held his ground-didn't retract one word of the truth.-

The consequence? From that time forth, the Government has
faithfully embodied, in all arsenals constructed, those rec-
ommendations for safety and protection which were stressed
in this McGraw-Hill journal.

McGraw-Hill editors, first of all, must dig out the truth : a a
then through every opposition, stick to their guns. This is
one big reason why so many of the nation’s leaders turn to
these journals for news on industry’s doings. This, too, is
one big reason why you should read the McGraw-Hill paper
that covers the field you expect to enter.
