THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

J Court System Awaits Approval

Mock Vote
Scheduled _
For Nov. 2

Four Organizations
To Cooperate In

Manning Ballot Boxes

By MARION BERGSTEIN

A mock presidential elec-
tion will be held Nov. 2, from
9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Polling
places will be located in the
Commons R o o m , the SU

and Mining Building.

Members of the Pitt News, Stu-
dents for Kennedy, Youth for
Nixon, and the Intercollegiate
Conference of Government are
working in cooperation to man the
polls.

No faculty member will be per-
mitted to vote. To avoid duplicate
voting, all student invoices will
be stamped with _a “V.”

Dr. Edward F. Cooke, associ-
ate professor of political science,
is in charge of the Program for
Practical Political Education
whose members will tally the
votes.

This group has been responsible
for the weekly polls covering stu-
dent’s choices for president.

Dr. Cooke is also chairman of
the Citizenship Clearing House
for Western Pennsylvania. Fifteen
or more colleges and universities
in Western Pennsylvania will par-
ticipate in mock elections similar
to the one that will be held here.

Students will be voting for
President, Vice-President, Judge
of the Superior Court, Auditor
General, and State Treasurer.

demonstrations will be held for
University students starting today

The demonstration will last ap-
proximately one hour and include
a brief talk on the IBM 7070. The
size, speed and function will be
discussed. There will be a demon-
stration and a film on the use of
the computer. _

Holland Hall Elevators Stopped
As Discipline for Men Residents

The men’s elevators in Holland Hall were shut down
Sunday night and all day Monday as a disciplinary action
prompted by extensive damage done to the elevators and
other dormitory facilities by residents.

Mike Cristof, head resident of Holland Hall, said that
the action was taken with the hope of creating respect for

At Fall Ball

Engineering and Mines Cabinet
is holding their annual Fall Ball

- at West View Danceland on Nov.

LeRoy and his orchestra.

Admission to the Fall Ball will
be by membership card only.
Cards may be obtained from any
E & M Cabinet representatives.
The price, $3.50, also includes ad-
mission to a social to be held later
this year.

Bill LeRoy’s Orchestra has been
playing for Cabinet dances since
before the second World War.
They have performed at a num-
ber of other University functions
such as the Christmas Formal last
December, and the Pan-Hellenic
formal. For the past ten years
they have also played for the Uni-
versity Alumni Ball.

Othe dorm facilities.

Damage to the residence halls
includes defacing of walls, re-
moval of parts of ﬁre hoses and
equipment, and destruction of
telephones. In the elevators there

have been attempts to dismantle
the mechanisms, and other general
abuse and defacing of the cars.

Students protest rallies were
curtailed by a meeting of the resi-
dents with Cristof and Dr. Wil-
liam Crafts, dean of men. The
purpose of his disciplinary action
was discussed.

“If intentional destruction of
the resident hall facilities con-
tinues, it will be necessary to en-
force stronger penalties until it is
stopped.” Christof commented.

Students living in Holland Hall
said that while they were annoy-
ed by the curtailing of elevator
service, they did not feel that
much was acgomplished.

One student commented, “I
realize now that the elevators are

Senate Claims
Poor Backing

Hinders Work

Lack of student backing in the
form of pressure and interest
groups has been one of the rea-
sons that the Senate has not been

according to Alan Garﬁinkel, par-
liamentarian of the Senate.

Garﬁinkel pointed out at last
week’s Senate meeting that the
Senate's office, 325 SU, is now
open during the day, and senators
are spending time there in order
to handle any student problems or
complaints which arise. “The stu-
dent body has failed to back us
in this respect up to now,” Gar-
ﬁnkel added.

“We, the Senate, work under
the democratic system. Our Con-
stitution is patterned after the
U.S. Constitution, and our Senate
is analogous to the Congress of
the U.S.

-“Our legislative process works
on ‘one big mass of complaints’
from interest groups pressuring
for legislation concerning their
particular interest.”

“We cannot go around asking
students for their complaints.
Students must come to us with
their questions and complaints,”
he said.

“We are doing out part,” said
Garfinkel, “now it is up to the
‘public’ of the University to do
their job.” A

‘Tom Lohrentz, chairman of
the Academic Committee of SG,

"reported on his plan to institute‘
a system of academic work
scholarships whereby students
would be given jobs in their re-
spective major ﬁelds. The jobs
would pay for part or all of the
students’ tuition.

“This system will be of help
both to faculty members and stu-
dents,” he said.

The scholarships would be
based on ﬁnancial need and aca-

Sen. Kennedy Regains Lead in Poll

The results of this week’s voting
show ‘that Senator John F. Ken-
ned has regained the lead in the
pre-election student opinion polls
with 46 per cent of the students’
votes over Nixon’s 43 per cent.

Nine per cent of the students
were undecided while two per cent
gave no opinion.

The survey shows that 52 per
cent of the men interviewed prefer

Kennedy _ and . 48 a per, cent. prefer ’
' ,Nixon. The ,women’s votes were

   

evenly distributed between the
two candidates.

This is the ﬁrst time in three
weeks that Senator Kennedy has
edged ahead of Vice President
Nixon.

Of the freshmen interviewed,
39 per cent were Kennedy sup-
porters and 50 per cent Nixon

supporters. Nixon received 50
per cent of the sophomore votes
and Kennedy 42 per cent. ’

Student Affairs Group
Must Give Final Okay

F ulton’s Plan Gains Assent in Senate;
Has Power Over All Governing Bodies
All that is needed to make the Supreme Court a func-
tioning body of Student Government is approval by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee as provided for in the SG constitution.
Last Friday the members of the Senate approved the
plan for the court system which was presented by Bob Fri-

ton, temporary chairman of the seven justice—elects.

SC Heads Groups

If the plan passes SAC, the
Supreme Court will be over the
Interfraternity Council Judicial
Commission, Panhellenic Council,
Men's Dormitory Court and W0-
men’s Housing Board. Fulton ex-
plained that Men’s Council, other
than judicially, will still exist.

In citing the original jurisdic-
tion of the Supreme Court, Ful-
ton gave an example of each
division. First, the court will
have original jurisdiction over
any case not under the jurisdic-
tion of the lower courts.

Alsothe court will try any case
concerning conflicts between two
or more organizations. “The in-
cident of the conflict between the
Student Union Board and Persh-
ing Rifles," Fulton said, “would
fall into this area,”

Conﬂicts Handled

Thirdly, the court will handle
any case concerning conflicts of
jurisdiction between two or more
lower courts. “For instance, if a
sorority and a fraternity were
working on some project and vio-
lated a University ruling," he
said, “then the case would come
immediately before our court."

The Supreme Court also has
original jurisdiction in all cases
concerning interpretation of the
SG Constitution. As an exam-
ple of this, Fulton said that if

Victor of Pitt-Penn
State Game to Get

‘Bronze Bucket

By CHUCK DUNBAR
After an absence of almost
two years the coal shuttle has

been returned to its rightful
owner, thanks to the honesty
of the vice-president of Penn_
-State’s Interfraternity Coun-

cll.

The Coal Shuttle is a battered
bronze coal bucket which is a tra-
ditional part of the Pitt-Penn
State football rivalry.

The inscription on the bucket '

reads, “Coal Shuttle presented by
the lnterfraternity Councils of the
University of Pittsburgh and Penn
State College to the winner of the

annual Pitt-Penn State football
game.”
No Trophy
Last year when Pitt won the

game, no one from Penn State

knew where the Coal Shuttle was. .

As a result, Pitt was denied its

turn to proudly display this
trophy of victory.
However, on Homecoming

weekend the vice-president of
Penn State’s IF Council brought
the old bronze bucket to its le-
gal owners.

The Coal Shuttle is displayed
in the Dean of Men’s office. If
Penn State wins this year's game
it will be kept at their Dean of
Mcn’s office.

Panther Meets Lion

Each year at the end of the
game the two mascots, the Pan-
ther and the Nittany Lion, get
together on the field and present
the trophy to whoever happens to
be the winner of that particular
game.

AThe Coal Shuttle goes back to
1893 when the defeated Panther
awarded the bucket to the vic-
torious Lion. The score was a
one-sided 32 to 0 in favor of
the visitors from State.

Every year the score of the
game is engraved on the Shuttle.
Except for a few lapses the buck-
et has been in circulation for 67
years. Pitt holds the edge in vic-
tories in this rivalry, winning 33
and losing 23 and tying 3. Eight
years are not listed on the Coal

Supreme Court Awaits

 

 Ratification of Proposal

 

(Continued from Page 1)

IF and student government were
"in disagreement as to who had
the power to decide on deferred
rush, then the Supreme Court
would decide who had this pow-

er. ’

Fulton emphasized that they
would not be making a decision
on deferred rush but merely de-
ciding who had the authority to
do this. He said, “We are not a
policy making body, we act only
on a particular case.”

.Cour_t of Appeals

The Supreme Court will be the
only student court that will have
appellate jurisdiction. All appeals
must be presented to the Supreme
Court in writing within seven
days of the lower court’s decision.
The Supreme Court shall hear a
petition for an appeal with a
quorum of two justices and the
Chief Justice.

Presently, IF has an appellate
court. If the Supreme Court is
approved by the SAC, this court
‘will be abolished. “The men’s
dormitory court is not function-
ing although the apparatus is
available,” Fulton said. The
Senate has the power to estab-
lish this court.

The Supreme Court will meet
every two weeks. Fulton added
that since they were not a law en-
forcing agency, students must
come to them. “We will not seek
them out.”

SAC _Decides Penalties

Concerning penalties, Fulton
said, “The SAC will decide how
these are to be administered.”

In order to clear up some mis-
understandings about their

progress, Fulton explained that
the justices-elect were not ob-
ligated to report to the Senate
but only had to appear before it
when they were seeking ap-
proval.

He said, “I am here today, not
because the Supreme Court is
prepared to propose a working
relationship for the‘ court sys-
tem.”

He concluded by suggesting that
the Senate discuss the proposal
with the outlook that this court
system must be projected into the
future and also without the in-
volvement of petty politics and
selfish personal gains.

At the executive meeting on
Monday. Fred Whittier, comment-
ed that nobody in the Senate
knew enough about the Supreme
Court to approve that plan. He
said, “No groups'who may be dis-
satisﬁed with the court were per-
mitted to speak for or against it.
The full extent of the Supreme
Court jurisdiction was not deline-
ated.”

A FRAT TO REMEMBER

Every year, as we all know, the Benevolent and Protective
Order of Collegiate Fraternities awards a highly coveted prize
to the fraternity house which, in its judgment, has done the
most. to promote and enhance the fraternity way of life. The
prize this yea.r—-—eight hundred pounds of white putty-goes to
the Signs. Phi Nothing chapter of the South Dakota. College
of Dentistry and Renaissance Art.

The award this year is exceptionally richly deserved, for tho
Signa Phi Nothing house is the very model of all a fraternity
should be. It is, first of all, a most attractive house physically.
The outside walls are tastefully covered with sequins. Running
along the upper story is a Widow’s walk, with a widow stationed
every three feet. Moored to the chimney pot is the Graf Zeppelin.

Indoors, the house gives an impression of simple, casual charm.
The chapter room is furnished in homey maple and chintz,
with a. dash of verve provided by a carp pool three hundred feet
in diameter. A waterspout rises from the center of the pool ‘with

the housemother bouncing on the top.

Members’ rooms are gracious and airy and are provided with
beds which disappear into the wa.ll-permanently. Each room
also has a desk, a. comfortable chair, a good reading lamp, and
o catapult for skeetshooting. Kidney-shaped desks are avail-
able for kidney—shaped members.

Perhaps the most fetching feature of the house are the packs
of Marlboros stacked in heaps wherever one goes. If one wishes
to settle back and enjoy a full-ﬂavored smoke, one needs only
to reach out one’s hand in any direction and pick a pack of
Marlboros—soft pack or ﬂip-top box—and make one’s self com-
fortable with a ﬁltered cigarette with an unﬁltered taste-that
triumph of the tobacconistls art, that paragon of smokes, that
acme of cigarettes, that employer of mine ---Marlboro!

  
  

I.’-

776%/3
//7,47%

The decor, the grace, the Marlboros, all combine to make
Signa Phi Nothing :1 real gas of a fraternity. But a fratemit-y

is more than things; it is also people. And it is in the people
department that Sigma Phi Nothing really shines.

Signa Phi Nothing has among its members the biggest
BMOCS on the entire campus of the South Dakota College of
Dentistry and Renaissance Art. There is, for instance, William
Zllakepeace Sigafoos, charcoal and bun chairman of the annual
Stamp Club outing. Then there is Dun Rovin, winner of last
year’s All—South Dakota State Monopoly .Championship, 135

IBM Machine Largest Owned
By Any School in Country

The Panther Room is now purring as it never has be-E.

fore. Dressed up with quiet drapes, ﬂourescent lighting, and
a new floor, it now harbors a IBM 7070 computer.

The 7070 is the first to be delivered to any university in
the country and the ﬁrst to any customer in the tri-state

area. It is the largest singly owned university computer in

the country.

Purchased under a National
Science Foundation grant, the
computer is expected to make
possible new research projects
and greatly accelerate existing
programs. It also will be used for
the development of new computer
applications.

No Charge for Use

The use of the computer will
be extended without cost to all
university students and faculty
and some high school students
with worthy projects.

Some of the projects for which
the computer will be used are:
information retrieval; project

, Talent; crystallography; study of

glaucoma; and market simulator.
The University has codiﬁed the
health laws of the state of Penn-
sylvania into an electronic “li-
'brary." l~leal.th legislation on any
subject may be retrieved in a
matter of minutes with the use Of
the computer.
To Extend to Other Laws
This pnot study will be extend-
ed to other laws and, perhaps ev-
entually, to all laws. This techni-
que will also be used for other
types of information searches.
In the university's 20-yea!‘
study of one out of every 20
high school students in the coun-
try, project Talent, the computer
will help evaluate some one bil-
lion test answers obtained so far.
The aim of this project is to ob-
tain an inventory of human re-
sources in the U.S., a set of stan-
dards for educational and pyscho-
logical measurement, and a com-
prehensive counseling guide in-
dicating patterns of aptitude and
ability which are predictive of
success in various careers.
Useful to Businessmen
A programming method devised
at the University for 7070 permits
business executives to test the
effects of various marketing stra-
tegies on individually sized mark-

Hanging Party?
Cynic Steps In,
Douses Plans

By TED COLTON \
Sports Editor ,

 

The tall stranger, a black hat pulled low over his eyes, shuffled
toward the tall, thick oak tree. There he exchanged nods with the
others grouped around the trunk. He had come as they had urgently
requested. Without a word. the group. as one, stared up at the tree.
They noticed specificallyithe extra thick branch hanging about 10
feet above the hard, cold sod.

They looked again at each other. Again as one. they nodded. They
said nothing, but the meaning was clear. It was a good tree; it was a
good branch.

The tall stranger ‘then opened a heavy leather bag he carried.

Like a snake being charmed out of its basket, a heavy. thickly knotted
rope—it was hemp—-shimmied from the bag through the strangers
hands. .
Effortlessly. black hat tossed the rope over the branch. Then he
put the platform in place, stepped up on it so he could reach the
branch and pulled the hemp tight. He pulled on it and stepped from
the platform, a smile of satisfaction curling his sinister lips.

There was no doubt about it. When black hat was summoned
for a big job. you knew it would be done right. After all, hadn’t he
successfully staged a similar job about a year ago. Black hat had
no‘ reason to believe this one wouldn't go off as smoothly as the
other.

Discontent was preparing to run rampant as it had before last
year‘s encounter with the rope. Just a few more days now and
that discontent would erupt into a rampaging flood of anger.

It would be a good hanging, he thought to himself. And the
smile again passed across his dark, shadowy face.

- Suddenly, as if a bolt of lightning had struck the tree, one of
the group stepped swiftly toward the rope. No one had really noticed
him before. ,He somehow had drifted into the group. He had the
face of a cynic, the rest of the group thought — as one. ‘

Pushing the noose so it lazily swung like a pendelum, the cynic

spoke. -

“There won‘t be any hangings” he Said- pausing Only 10118
enough to glance at the horriﬁed faces of his listeners, he continued.

“If .you wanted a hanging, you should’ve done it earlier. Now
that you’ve decided to wait until after Saturday, you’ve lost your
chance. It’s gonna be different than you think. Those Cats are gonna
eat those big guys like they’re oranges. Just watch the juice flow.”
A The would—be hanging party was stunned. They stood there,
gaping at this cynic. He didn’t stop.

“You guys are gonna feel pretty silly about this whole thing
after you see what happens Saturday,” he said. “This is gonna be
the biggest notch Big Mike puts on his belt this year.

 “I know you guys are hoping he doesn’t get it. It would spoil
your party if he does. But I’m telling you, you’re wasting your time
now. He’s gonna, fake you right out of his noose.” I

Visibly shaken, the party members moved slowly away from
the tree. Only black hat paused. He gazed longingly at his work,
dangling there from that lovely, thick branch. It had done such a
beautiful job last year. '

All he could do now, though, was turn and shuffle away. head
bowed, hat tilted lower than usual. He could only hope —- hope that
the cynic wouldnt be right. As he walked shakingly toward the
horizon, he turned and looked back.

_ There, hanging ominously, waiting patiently, maybe in vain,
the rope. ’

two teams will probably repre-

playoffs. ' _

the Psi 0's, appear to have sewn
up the other independent place in
the playoffs.

Howard Team

The Panther booters meet
Howard University Saturday
at 2 p.m. on the Practice Field.

Howard has one of the top
soccer teams in the Southern
Conference. Last year the
Bisons ranked among the ﬁrst ten
squads in the country. This year.
according to the Bison Coach, Ted
Chambers. “We should have one
of the best teams in our history.”

The Cats and the Bisons have
played one common foe in Slip-
pery Rock. The Blue and Gold
eaked out a 2-1 .victory while
the Bisons breezed to a 3-0 win.
This will be the first meeting of
these two teams.

Again the Panthers will go into
the game hindered by injuries.
The big question mark in Bemis’
mind is fullback Ron Prado. “If
Prado works out this week and
gets in fairly good condition, he
may‘ play Saturday,” said Bemis.
Corky Cuthbert deﬁnitely will not

play this week and may be out
for the season.

siasm.

There will be a meeting on
Monday at 12 p.m. All lettermen

An election of officers will take

eleven has its sights set o

highly ranked Syracuse this week in what may be the top
game of the East. Forithe Panthers it is a “must” game.
Syracuse has defeated the Panthers for three straight
years including a 35-0 win last year. This was the largest
total points scored on a ‘John Michelosen team since he be-

came head coach in 1955. The¢.__,__

Panther would like to settle that
score.

Then too. a win over highly
ranked Syracuse might be the
the Panthers have been
looking for to spark them through
the rest of the season. The Cats
record is 2-2. p -

“We can beat them if we play
to our potential," Captain Mike
Ditka said. “But it will have to

 

be a team effort, something we
haven’t had in previous games.
We have to want this win over
Syracuse; we have to be hungry
for it.”

The Panthers main problem ap-
pears to be containing Syracuse’s
flashbacks Art Baker and Arnie
Davis. Last. year Davis had a tre-
mendous afternoon against the
Panthers. He again seems headed
for All-American recognition.

However, the Panthers" will
have to contain these players if
they hope to stall the Orange-
men’s powerful offensive machine.

The Panthers may have to take
to the air to upset Syracuse. Their
most formidable threat on passes
is “Jimbo” Jim Traficant. Trafi-
cant has completed 27 of 51 passes
for 387 yards and four touch-
downs. Only once has he had a
pass intercepted.

Bob Clemens is the Panthers
leading ground gainer with an
average of ﬁve yards per carry
in 55 attempts. Cox is second in
rushing but leads in passes re-
ceived, 10 for 163 yards, points
scored 26, and punting with a
43.1 average in 21 kicks. ‘

Harriers Get Rest
Before NYU Meet

The Panther harriers will rest
this weekend as they have no
meet scheduled. They will resume
competition when they dual meet
with New York University on
November 5 in_ the season’s final
match.

The best the Panther’s can hope
to do record-wise is a 2-4 mark,
but NYU is annually strong. The
Violets will provide the last test
for the Cats before the IC4A
championship on the Van Court-
land course, which is also located
in New York.

The freshmen have a better
chance of winning frosh IC4A’s
with a 2-1 mark to date. Their
only loss was a two point edge
by Navy in a triangular meet.

By JIM 0’BR1EN

Everyone at the West Vir-
ginia c r o s s - country meet
searched the crest of Flagstaff
Hill, looking for the first run-
ner to appear. Much to every-
one’s surprise it was not the
favorite; it was Sophomore Bob
'l‘arkany.

A proud, determined grin creas-
ed his perspiring face as he jog-
ged by the finish line. No one was
more surprised by this upset win
than Bob himself.

Speaking through parched lips,
ghostly white with dried saliva,
he grinned, “I‘ve never dreamed
that I would ever win a college
cross—c0untry meet.”

Pre-Dental Student

Bob, a 19-year old pre-dental
student, humbly accepted the con-
gratulations from the crowd. He
along with Vance Carter came to
Pitt from Rocky River High
School.

Carter's dad, a regular fan at
the meets, commented at the
ﬁnish line, “That kid’s got more
damn guts than the whole bunch
of them.” Bob has to have that

extra dividend because he is a

mere 5'8” and Weighs only 135.

"Tark” was not highly regarded
in pre-season estimates, but he
has assumed the number two
position on the team. In his
Mountie win, he succeeded Harry
Stokes, the harriers number one
man. I

Lost 14 Pounds

"I was no great shakes as a

year."

To make matters worse, Bob
contracted bronchial pneumonia
and lost 14 pounds. When he re-
covered Bob started to lift
weights-

“They have helped me too,”
Bob explained. “I feel stronger on
the hills.” Scaling the hills is
Tarkany’s forte as he makes up
ground where most of the ﬁeld
weakens. “Uphill is my strength,”
Bob reasoned, “Because I an.-
small and my center of gravity is
better.”

He claims Coach Carl Rees
isn’t a bad loser: “He sulks like
we all do. But he doesn’t yell.

On Nov. 14 he will compete in
the ICAA championship in New
York. Perhaps Mrs. Rees should
be stationed at the ﬁnish line to
insure a good performance by
Bob.

“I hope that I do well,” he said.
“It is supposed to be like one big,
wild herd taking oﬂ’. I’ll have to
get ahead and stay. I just hope
that not too many guys pass me.”

It is another dream for Robert
Tarkany, but his dreams have
come true in the past.

"This One for Keeps’ — Schwartzwalder

Syracuse and the Panthers,
two of the nation’s football
powers, meet at Syracuse’s
home ﬁeld this Saturday in a
gridiron battle that shapes up
as the East’s game of the day.

“This one will be played
keeps." said Orange Coach Ben
Schwartzwalder. “Our kids will
tell you every year that Pitt plays
the hardest-hitting football we
see. lt should be quite a ball
game."

The Panthers. under John
Michelosen, have more than one
reason to covet a win over the
Orange. Not only have Schwartz-
walder-coached Orange teams
trimmed th e Panthers three
straight times, but last year’s
Syracuse steamroller flattened
Pitt 35-0 before a partisan Pan-
ther crowd. It was the worst Pan-
ther loss in years.

Actually, the Syracuse series,
since it was resumed in 1955, has
been marked by thrill-packed
games. The.Jungle Cats whipped
Syracuse here 22-12 in 1955, and
then followed up by edging Jim
Brown and company 14-7 in 1956
for what turned out to be Syra-
cuse’s only loss of the season.

Both the 1957 and 1958 con-

for

tests were pulse—stoppers, with,
Syracuse winning both times.’
The Orangemen prevailed 24-21 L

in Pittsburgh in ‘57 on a late-
game ﬁeld goal,
Syracuse 16-13 in ’58 by holding
off a late-game Pantheridrive.

Despite Syracuse‘s recent suc-

cesses, the Panthers still leads the
Orangemen in the overall series,
which started in 1916. The Cats
won eight games, Syracuse four,
and two have ended in ties.

Smith Leads As
Player Closes In;

Female Falls

By Who Wantza T!

The faithful yogies are back
again this week to show their
abilities in picking games. Last
week Jack (Scoop) Smith led with
a 10-4 record. Both Dick Mills,
the player, and Roger McGill, the
team trainer, had 9-5 records.
Mills kept the players in second
place.

The rest of the ﬁeld was down
in the dumps with Marshall Ro-
meo leading them with a 7-7
«record. The female, Joanne
“Speedy” Dolinar, has ﬁnally
rounded into form coming
through with a ﬁne 6-8 card.
Ted Colton has at last convinced
someone that it is fun to lose
and had Consensus with him on
a a 5-10 record.

This week we have as guests
Chuck Reinhold representing the

 players and Carroll “Beano” Cook

   

 

as the guest.
