Trustees address
Farrakhan conﬂict

By David Zafris

Staff Writer

Opposition to Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan’s planned visit to Pitt

‘was raised at yesterday’s Board of

Trustees meeting.

Farrakhan, 52, is scheduled to speak
on Nov. 14 in the assembly room of
the William Pitt Union.

The leader of the‘ Chicago-based
Black Muslim sect, Farrakhan has been
widely criticized for calling Adolf
Hitler “Wickedly great  a very great
man,” and referring to Judaism as a
“gutter religion.”

Former state senator Louis Cop-
persmith said that students shouldn’t
have to pay for lectures of this type.

“I’m a strong advocate of free
speech, but I do have great reservations
about students being forced to pay for
the speech of an individual who is ut-
tering inﬂammatory and slanderous
comments about Israe ,” Coppersmith
said as he addressed the Board of
Trustees.

“And I also ﬁnd it anomalous that
those many individuals who object to
university funds being used, however
indirectly, to support a racist regime

‘ ‘I want to say that just as this per-
son [Farrakhan] has the right of

ﬁeedom of speech, I think students

have the right to say that these

ﬁmds which they ’re required to pay

will not be used to subsidize a talk

of this type. ”
Former state senator
Louis Coppersmith

in South Africa, have no compunction
about using university ftmds to support
a racist and anti-Sernitic speaker at the
University of Pittsburgh, ’ ’ he
continued. ‘

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
responded to Coppersmith’s com-

'ments, explaining Pitt’s policy con-

cerninz controversial speakers.

campaigning dispute

Staff Writer

Student Government Board member
Dan Taylor was acquitted last night of
charges that he violated election codes
during last Friday’s divestment rally.

Jeff Carpenter, elections committee
member, charged Taylor with
distributing a statement supporting the
demonstration which was allegedly ac-
companied by urges to vote for him as
an SGB presidential candidate, thereby
violating existing codes.E1ection rules
prohibit campaigning before October
23.

Carpenter accused Taylor of two
counts of code violation: employing
SGB resources for campaign purposes
and verbally urging students at the rally
to vote for him. Taylor was acquitted
on both counts. .

The hearing, which was held at 8:30
yesterday evening, was charged with
emotion and personal conﬂict. Taylor,

Pitt observes

By Susan Washburn
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh will
join a nationwide effort to increase
awareness of the hunger crisis by
participating in World Food Day
which will be held in Forbes Quad-
rangle today from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.

World Food Day was established
in l979 at the United Nations Con-
ference of the Food and Agriculture
Organization. The 1984 observance
was the first year the teleconference
format was used. The message to

end world hunger was received at

in his defense, warned the committee
of Carpenter’s potential bias in
reference to Governmental Relations
Committee appointments last year. ‘ ‘I
must note for the record that the con-
testant Jeffrey J. Carpenter does bear
grudges and harbor resentment against
me of a personal nature,” Taylor said.
Carpenter speciﬁcally stated that
previous events in no way inﬂuenced
his role as committee prosecutor.-
SGB member Avery Abrams sat in
on the hearing as ex ofﬁcio represen-
tative, arriving just ten minutes before
-the hearing began. He charged witness
Dan Baites with presenting hearsay
evidence for -his testimony that an
alleged representative of Tayor was
campaigning at the rally. After the_ac-
quittal was announced, Carpenter said,
‘ ‘Mr. Abrams, being obviously biased
personally and sitting on the commit-
tee during the questioning process was
certainly a complete violation of
ethics.” Carpenter said, however, that
he will not appeal the committee rul-
ing on the case.

World Food Day teleconference is
brought directly from Washington,

College enrollment low in state

According to a recent study spon-
sored by the Pennsylvania Association
of Colleges and Universities, fewer
Pennsylvama residents participate in
post-secondary education than do
citizens of neighboring statesand the
rest of the nation.

The 40—page study, entitled
“Parents. Programs and Pennsylvania
Students’ Plans,” revealed that Penn-
sylvamans are less likely to go to col-
lege in the future.

The House Subcommittee on Higher
Education conducted a public hearing

last Thursday to address this problem.
If Pennsylvania's participation rate had
been equal to the national percentage,
140,000 more students would have
been attending college in 1980. At that
time, 6.1 percent of Pennsylvanians
age 18 or older were enrolled in col-
lege. The corresponding percentage for
contiguous states (Maryland, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio and West
Virginia) was 7.5 percent, and in the
rest of the nation, 7.9 percent were at-
tending college. '

Pitt President Wesley Posvar, who
was the ﬁrst to address the committee,
said he sees high tuition rates as a
primary factor contributing to the prob-
lem of lower enrollment. He referred
to the fact that although Pitt, Temple
and Penn State are the mainstream of
‘access for people with limited means
to advanced post-graduate and profes-
sional study and research, the tuition
rates of these institutions are higher
than all other similar public research
universities in the country. Posvar
urged the General Assembly to con-
tinue its efforts in holding down tuition
levels in the public sector. _

Posvar identiﬁed a second obstacle
to enrollment as a deﬁciency in incen-
tive. He-said that the most important
challenge to educators is not simply to
recruit  admit more high school
semors into college programs, but to
expand the pool of young people who

college. «

To meet this challenge, Posvar said
it is necessary to reach back to the
students’"earlier years and install in
them ambitions to become managers,
professionals and leaders. Considering
this, he went on to suggest that
developing strong ' between
cplleges and high schools is the most
effective route to aﬂirmative action and
access to higher education in general.
..Great'er ‘cooperation between Penn-
‘sylvania schools and the higher educa-
tion sector must be fostered as a means
‘toward a more effective educational in-
centive system, Posvar said.

Pennsylvania's shortfall -in educa-
tion, explained Posvar, is all the wider
because the nation itself is _“at risk”

in its struggle to meet the competitive '

world challenge. He cited, as an exam-
ple, the‘ statistics underscoring our,
educational attitudes.

Recent surveys indicate that 84 per-
cent of U.S. high school students do

not take physics and 65 percent do not V A

take chemistry, while all Soviet high
school students take three years of
chemistry. The United States ranks last
among its major allies and adversaries,
taking only three years of science and
math, Posvar said. ' ,

Reagan says “never” to Egyptian demands for apology

(WASHINGTON) —— President
Reagan said he is happy about the cap-
ture of the Achille Lauro pirates, and
he declared yesterday that the United
States will “never” apologize to Egypt
for forcing its jetliner to land in Sici-
ly. Navy jets diverted the plan carry-
ing four Palestinian terrorists last week.
Egyptian president Mubarak had
called for an ofﬁcial American apology
for the interception. ,

The ﬁghters reportedly jammed the
Egyptian jetliner’s communication
systems when it radioed to controllers
for instructions. Then they escorted it
to a NATO base on Sicily.

The president made his remarks in
Boise, Idaho, his first of two stops
yesterday to campaign for Republican
senators. He will also speak in
Milwaukee, Wis. '

Militias seek peace
while wars wage on

(Lebanon) — The leaders. of
Lebanon’s three most powerful mihuas

reportedly are anxious for an end to
hostilities in the 10-year-old civil war.

Officials of the Moslem Shiite Amal,
the Druze Progressive Socialist Party
and the Christian Lebanese forces met
in Damascus, Syria, yesterday.

In east Beirut, ﬁghting resumed be-
tween rival Christian  Factions
are divided over the issue of Syrian
peace initiatives.

Soviets seek
economic change

(U.S.S.R.) — Mikhail Gorbachev is
calling for economic change in the
Soviet Union on what he terms a “truly
historical scale.”

The Soviet leader said industrial out-
put and national income should double
by the end of the century. His remarks
were addressed to a meeting of the
Communist Party's Central Com-
mittee.

, Gorbachev’s comments were part of
a bluepring for the next Five-year Plan,
designed to guide the Soviet Union's

social and economic development into
1990.

In a surprise move, the Soviet leader
raised his new economic engineer to
non—voting membership in the
18-member Politburo.

On Monday, Nikolai Talyzin was ap-

‘pointed to head the Soviet Union's

Bureau of Economic Planning and to
replace the ailing Nikolai Tikhonov.
The 80-year-old former prime minister
was a close associate of late Premier
Brezhnev. Tikhonov’s retirement
marks yet another shake-up in the Polit-
buro as Gorbachev continues to con-
solidate his hold.

Supreme Court

reviews old treaties

(WASHINGTON) -— The Supreme
Court agreed yesterday to decide if
treaties dating from the Indian Wars of
the Old West give native Americans the
right to hunt bald eagles and other pro-
tected animals on their reservations.

The case is an appeal brought by the
government against Dwight Dion, a
Yankton Sioux convicted of killing and

selling bald eagles. The national sym-
bol is federally protected, but a federal
appeals court ruled that Dion was im-
mune from prosecution for killing the
birds. The ruling was based on treaties
dating back to 1851 that recognize the
rights of Indians to hunt on lands set
aside for them. N

The court also announced it will
review another case involving Indian
rights. At issue is a North Dakota law
that bars a tribe from suing non-Indians
to hunt on lands set aside for them.

The justice also heard arguments in
a dispute over whether students can
hold prayer meetings in public schools
during time set aside for club meetings
and other student activities. The case
is the major church—state dispute on the
docket this term.

Franco _-. Modigliani won the Nobel
Memorial Prize in economic sciences
yesterday.

After winning the prize, the pro-
fessor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology said that he will “speak

was aimed at President Reagan. .

Modigliani blasted Reagan for what
he calls the disastrous federal deﬁcit.
‘ ‘The deﬁcit offsets the savings of peo-

Arms control group seeks signature in

Staff Writer

“Don’t just talk, stop the arms race
now!” reads the slogan of the arms
control group SANE and its current
petition campaign to pressure the U.S.
and Soviet governments into produc-
ing a comprehensive treaty bannning
the testing of nuclear weapons at the
Nov. 14 summit meeting in Geneva.

Dr. David Cortright, executive na-
tional director of the Committee for a
Sane Nuclear Policy, spoke last week

as. on a broad spectrum of topics relevant

to arms control, ranging from Reagan’s

SDI program (Star Wars) to battleﬁeld-

level “tactical” nuclear weapons.
The picture Dr. Cortright drew at

Thursday’s lecture at Carnegie-Mellon .

University’s Skibo Hall was that
whether launched from F-15s at the
edge of the earth's atmosphere or ﬁred
from the barrel of an artillery cannon
in West Germany, nuclear weapons to-
day pose a danger quickly growing
beyond our control.

The Washington-based “SANE,”
which has grown from 4,000 to more
than 130,000 members since Cortright
became director in 1977, monitors the
plethora of issues surrounding nuclear
weapons, including weapons procure-
ment legislation, defense spending and
U.S.-Soviet relations.

The group’s current objective is to,

present to the US. and Soviet em-
bassies in Geneva on Sunday, Nov. 17
one million signatures demanding an
immediate halt to nuclear weapons
testing. _

Cortright argued that the opportuni-
ty for agreement on arms control and
ultimate arms reductions is at hand. He
made his point on two levels. '

First, Cortright quoted national polls
in which a majority of the public
ranked arms control, together with the
deﬁcit, as the nation's most urgent
issue.

“There has been a profound
transformation in people's thinking

about nuclear weapons,” Cortright
said. ‘ ‘Sixty-eight percent of the public
believes that if the situation keeps up
as it is, it’s only a question of time [un-
til nuclear war breaks out].”
' Secondly, the Soviet Union’s in-
itiative in unilaterally halting weapons
testing and offering to reduce its
nuclear arsenal if the United States
abandons the SDI program is a tremen-
dous breakthrough, Cortright
explained.

Considering these developments,
Cortright reasoned, a signiﬁcant arms

control agreement with broad popular '

support can now be realized.

In light of the Soviet initiative, Cort-
right speciﬁcally emphasized the op-
portunity for a comprehensive test ban
treaty. He pointed out the success of
the Johnson Administration in gaining
an atmospheric test ban agreement with
Kruschev in the earlv 1960s. Two
months after Johnson unilaterally
stopped above-ground testing, the
Soviet Union followed suit and signed
the test ban treaty. ‘ ‘We have the same
opportunity now,” Cortright said.

In response to a question on the
viability of verifying adherence to such
a treaty, Cortright admitted that more
veriﬁcation technology was needed. He
reiterated, however, that sufﬁcient
technology now exists to legitimatize
a test ban treaty. “Sweden does it all
the time,” he said in reference to
Sweden’s consistentmonitoring of at-
mospheric and under-ground weapons
testing all over the world.

The Soviet Union has further agreed
to install 12 U.S.-made “black box”
detection devices upon request, Cort-
right added. Two former heads of the
Central Intelligence Agency also
recently testiﬁed in congress that the

. United States has the necessary
technology already in place, Cortright
said. He further stated that international
agencies should play a larger role in the
veriﬁcation process, suggesting a U.N.
satellite observation system.

,_ support of possible test ban treaty

ii T’ By Michael Ashford

Cortright also discussed what he
called the Reagan administrati6n’s
‘ ‘cynical refusal to cooperate with the
Soviet’s unilateral test ban.” Cortright
accused Reagan of “ignoring the op-
portunity” now before him.

After assigning high priority to arms
control in his 1980 campaign, he said,
Reagan waited 17 months before even
addressing the issue. Reagan, Cortright
pointed out, has reached no arms
agreements with the Soviet Union, in-

stead choosing to let Ford and Carter’s '

progress with SALT II to dissolve and
to introduce the ‘-‘dangerous and
destabilizing” Star Wars program.

SANE, Cortright explained, has con- _
demned the SDI program on, several -

grounds. He described SDI as “a
dressed-up, warmed-over, high-
technology, anti-ballistic missile
system,” an abrogation of existing
ABM treaties. In combination with ex-
isting ﬁrst—striké weapons on both
sides, he explained, space weapons
make up “an intense movement to ﬁrst-
strike capability” in both countries.

SANE brought to Congress two
computer software scientists who quit
the Pentagon’s SDI research project,
deeming it “scientiﬁcally unfeasible. ”
SDI, Cortright said, is “destabilizing,
threatening_ and dangerous,” with the
added potential to destroy observation
satellites now vital to both countries’
sense of security.

Cortright guided his lecture to a cal‘
for public pressure on the administra-
tion. “Our pressure can make a dif-
ference,” he said, quoting President
Eisenhower’s 1959 statement. “I
believe people want peace so much, I
think that someday the governments
will have to get out of the way to let
them have it.”

After accumulating the one million
signatures, SANE plans to make a
public presentation at a convention in
Chicago on Nov. 16. From there, Cort-
right said, they will be ﬂown directly
to Geneva. .

Deﬁcit Woes

In the face of a mounting national deﬁcit, the Reagan ad-
ministration continues to push for tax cuts and for increased
military spending while insisting that any further cuts,
regardless of how inconsequential they say the results may
be, must be aimed at domestic programs, many of which have
already had their appropriations trimmed to the bone.

There is growing concern among American legislators
regarding the ominous deﬁcit. And it’s about time. In the
past four years under the leadership of President Reagan,
the national debt has doubled, climbing to a level of over
$2 trillion. This mind-boggling amount is certainly cause for
alarm.

Unfortunately, it seems that congressional anxiety has been
transformed into panic. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Plan,
which was passed by the Senate this week, brings promises
of a balanced budget by 1991. But frightfully, it also relin-

' quishes a portion of congressional budgetary control, deliver-

ing it into the hands of a single-minded president.

This plan calls for an armual budget reduction of $36 billion
beginning after next year’s elections. Should Congress be
unable to produce these reductions, then the president would

be authorized to do so, undertaking across-the-board spend-~

ing cuts on all but the Social Security program. Stunning,
isn't it?

It’s hard to believe that the Senate could be so irresponsi-
ble as to entrust a single man with such absolute power over
the budget. The passage of this plan implies congressional
admission of its inability to achieve spending cuts or to raise

-taxes, and is a shameless attempt to surrender responsibility.

President Reagan has repeatedly displayed an indifference

to controlling the budget. And the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings

Plan would give him unrestricted license to pursue the drastic
cuts in domestic spending and the increases in military spend-
ing which he favors.

Make no mistake: Reducing the budget will be, at best,
of secondary concern to President Reagan. He will not, as
seems necessary, raise taxes to accomplish a budget

. reduction.

We must ask: In this matter, has the Senate represented
the interests of its constituents, or has it rather played into
the hands of a cunning statesman?

Funding Evil

1 was disappointed at the recent
report in The Pitt News (Monday, Oct.
14) that the Student Government
Board's Allocation Committee may
deny Hillel’s request for funding to in-
vite Mr. Robert Clary, a speaker from
the Simon Wiesenthal Center, because
the committee fears that the
honorarium awarded Mr. Clary will
ultimately be donated to that
organization.

I certainly understand the commit-
tee’s original objection —— on technical

grounds‘ —' to the speaker"’s‘request that
his $3,000 speaker's fee be directly
donated to the Simon Wiesenthal
Center. While it is surely laudable for
an individual to be so selﬂessly devoted
to his/her “cause” (regardless of its
goals) as to seek no personal proﬁt
from such engagements, it is not — nor
should it be — within SGB’s power to
use student funds to directly support
any charitable organization. I am sure
that this “technicality” is designed, in
part, to protect against possible misuse
or indiscreet use of these monies. Fur-
thermore, it serves to insulate the
stewards of these funds from conﬂicts
of interest in how these funds are
dispensed. Given this scenario, the
committee would be acting according
to the letter of the law, had it denied
funds.

And _et, the scenario signiﬁcantly

chang’ when the speaker in question
rescinded his request and agreed that
payment of the fee be made directly to
 Now the point is moot — the
preyiotrsly legitimate objection to fund-
ing has technically disappeared. Never-
theless, there are those

committee who continue to block fun-
ding for the representative of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center because, they claim,
this change is merely a “technicality,”
since it is assumed that Mr. Clary will
now, himself, donate his speaker’s fee
to his organization. These individuals
feel that the ‘ ‘spirit of the law’ ’ is now
being violated, since the same-end may
be accomplished by an  means.
What is different, technically, is the

“ issue of responsibility: In the ﬁrst case,

SGB is culpable for how funds are to
be spent; in the second, it is the in-
dividual speaker’s prerogative to spend
his fee as he sees ﬁt.

Is it not this same Allocations Com-
mittee that last spring granted funding
to the Black Action Society to invite
Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam
to espouse his racist, anti-Semitic brand
of bigotry under such appeals as “pro-
tection of freedom of speech” and “en—
suring that the university serve as a
forum for all views. ” Have these com-
mittee members, who now struggle
with their new-found consciousness,
ever asked themselves why these

_ speakers don’t volunteer their services

for free in order to present their plat-
forms? Do these  think that

an-_  ".—v. - ~  -— --. 

 

Letters to the Editor

the large sum of money from this
university going to Mr. Farrakhan, for
example, will end up in the coffers of
the Boy Scouts, the Anti-Defamation
League or to aid the Mexican earth-
quake victims? I sincerely think not.

In fact, the SGB — and all ofus in
the university community — need to
ask ourselves some hard questions
about the purpose and destiny of our
student funds. While it is, perhaps, our
responsibility to open the podiurns of
the university to diverse, and
sometimes unpopular ideas, is it thus
our defacto obligation to accompany
this freedom with large sums of
money? Is it not painfully obvious that
while we technically cannot (and
should not) support speciﬁc causes
outright, that we are, in fact, doing so
indirectly when we pay speakers above
and beyond travel expenses? Thoreau
said, “I may not agree with what you
have to say, but I shall defend to the
death your right to say it!” Bravo! But
he didn't offer his bank account in the
process! '

Where, then, are our priorities? The
inherent irony in this situation should
notbelostonthereadingaudience. The
Allocation Committee is currently go-
ing through mental contortions about
funding _a speaker from the Simon
Wiesenthal Center — an organization
devoted to public education of the
Holocaust in Europe and to raising
public awareness against all foirns of
hatred, bigotry and racism. Yet, in less’
than one month (Thursday, Nov. 14 at
7 p.m.), this campus will be the forum
to the divisive and hateful views of
Louis Farrakhan, who wittingly or un-
wittingly sows those same seeds of
malcontent that so easily ripen into the
poisonous fruits of prejudice and

racism that foment violence.

I urge SGB’s Allocation’s Commit-
tee to channel our funds, in the future,
to deserving speakers and acitivities —
not to those that promote, rather than
eschew, ugly ideas. They can start by
approving Hillel’s requested funding to
have the rational insights from Mr.
Robert Clary of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center heard on this campus.

FAS-GSO Prodded

In my original letter to The Pitt
News (published Oct. 4), I argued
that the FAS-Graduate Student
Organization, contrary to the views
of particular representatives, could
not remain above politics.

I would like to take this opportu-
nity to state once again that the
FAS-GSO ‘cannot remain above
politics for the following reasons:

The Pitt News — October 16, 1985 ,....

First, Pitt’s $37 million in invest- —

ments in South ‘Africa in itself
involves student and faculty in the
issue of apartheid; and second, uni-

' versity monies which are invested in

South Africa are not being used in
economically depressed [areas in]
Pittsburgh to create jobs for the
unemployed and'to provide ade-
quate housing and learning resour-
ces for an expanding Pitt student

population. As Pitt students,‘our’5‘

educational needs _are not being met
and, worse, we are implicated as pas-
sive supporters of racist, undemo-
cratic South African dictatorship --
which -in and of itself is a political
position. ‘
It‘ is also necessary to restate that
the “serious FAS-GSO discussion of
South Africa” consisted of unin-
formed remarks to the effect that
blacks in “democratic South Africa”
— who are denied citizenship and
the franchise — are better off than
blacks in the United States.
Concerning the statement that
there was not a quorum present at
the last meeting, I had suggested that
the organization sponsor a referen-
dum on_divestment to take place
after Oct. 11 (if need be), thereby
involving all graduate students (in
democratic fashion) in this issue.
Finally, I found it ironic and sad
that these particular representatives
failed to respond to the points I

Dear Janine the Queen (and other
Homecoming Queen candidates),

Congratulations, Janine! I'm so
proud of you. Here you are the
Homecoming Queen. So young and
already such an achievement. The on-
ly problem with winning a contest as
big as this is that your life could pretty
much be all downhill from here on in.

What could ever top being Homecom-
ing Queen? Except maybe being Miss
Pennsylvania _or Miss January.

And all you other losing candidates,

don’t take it too hard. As long as you
keep smiling pretty like you did on that

Homecoming poster that was
everywhere last week, somebody will

always be around to buy the beer. And
you all had such pretty smiles. They
were phony, sure, but still pretty. And
I know all you girls wanted to win so
badly. But why shouldn’t you? It is a
great, great thing to be Homecoming
Queen. I really feel sorry for you
losers. You had to keep your plastic
smiles on all week and you got nothing
for it. At least Janine the Queen got to

-see the Pitt football game for free.

I guess-she just wanted it more than
you other ladies. You couldn’t turn
around for the past week without see-
ing those three little words that meant
so much: “Janine For Queen.”

What was it, though, that qualiﬁed
you to be Homecoming Queen, Janine?

What qualiﬁes anybody? They say it’s
more than what you look like, and I
read in an article in The Pitt News that
every single candidate interviewed was
against apartheid. You people are so
moral, it’s scary.

But just between you and me, ladies,
we know all that really matters is looks.
It's that way in life, so why shouldn’t
it be that way in a Homecoming queen
contest? Remember that old saying,
“It's not who you are, but who you
look like. ” But I don’t have to tell you
ladies that. You’ve known it since
eighth grade.

I suppose the whole thing adds up to
popularity. Just two days ago another
Pitt News article said, ‘ ‘The people
whoarewell knownoncampusaretlie
traditional Homecoming king or

queen,” a guide from candidate Mike
Ryan. That’s surely true. I know when
I think of the good old University of
Pittsburgh, the first thing that pops in-
to my head is Joe and Janine, our king
and queen.

But ladies, be honest now. How
many people over the past week and a
half were you nice to just to get their
vote? You know, people you can’t
stand; you’d talk to them and act like
you reallycaredthattheyhadtwomid-
terms in a row next Thursday. You
know the type of people I mean? All
the losers that you usually ignore on
your way to class. (You just couldn ’t
be seen talking to anyone who is, God
forbid, ugly. Especially in public.‘
What would the big brothers at the frat
think? You have a rep to protect.)

- Homecoming Smiles and who will Buy the Beer?

I guess it’s OK to talk to them if you
need their vote, though. At least now
you can go back to ignoring them.

I wonder if being so phony ever

bothers you all? Maybe not for ’

something as monumental as this
Homecoming queen contest, but when
you go to sleep at night, doesn’t a lit-
tle voice tell you that something has
gone wrong? Do you hear it at all?
Well, ladies, I suppose I should close
this letter now. I know it’s been such
a bother to read this whole long thing,
but I have just one more thing to say.
The next time you ﬁnd yourself in the
library—it’sthatbuildingacrossfrom
theunion —pickupacopy ofJ.D. Sal-
inger’s “The Catcher In The Rye.”
I'm not saying it will help you, butGod
knows, it sure couldn’t hurt. .

Corporate beauty is a

By Evangeline D’Aquila
For The Pitt.News

The 1980s: a time of increased op-
porttmity for women, a decade when
the adage "beauty is only skin deep"
had been repeatedly disproved, and an
era when the attractive people were
supposedly more socially desirable and
expected to be in possession of better
jobs, marriages and lives.

But now, despite die trends that have
been dominating the '80s, the attrac-
tive women in the working world are
constantly confronted with an obstacle
that was advantageous in earlier years,
their beauty.

Whether it be in the college
classroom or climbing the corporate
ladder, there seems to be a ﬂaw in the
‘ ‘beauty is best’ ’ principle. Surprising
studies have disclosed that instead of
beauty aiding the bright, young career
woman, it is undermining her credibili-
ty, even though good looks have
proved to work in a positive way for
men. '

Anne 0. M. Bowman, a political
scientist at the University of South
Carolina, headed studies on women,
beauty and politics. She found that
good looks, which had once been an
asset in childhood and adolescence,
became a hindrance for adult women.

In 'Bowman’s study, 125 college
students, both men and women, were
asked to rank hypothetical candidates
for local, state and congressional of-
ﬁces solely on the basis of photographs.
When the only thing known about the
candidate is the way he or she looks,

. students ranked attractive men and

unattractive women highest.

One Pitt professor, who desired
anonymity, believes that the double
standard of good looks and success
resulted from men being perceived as
more masculine simply because they
were handsome, and therefore possess-
ing more of the stereotypically
masculine traits of independence, logic
and objectivity.

On the other hand were attractive
women, who were associated with

catch-22

“Men are probably in-
timidated, as it is an
unspoken blow to their
egos to see women in a
position of equal or
greater importance. Per-
sonallyltrytolookateachv
applicant based on merit
and qualiﬁcations instead
of as men or women, at-
tractive or unattractive. ”

ultra-femininity and with the
stereotypical female traits such as
dependence, emotion and subjectivity.
The double standardoccurredsincethe
higher-level jobs were traditionally
held by men, and it seemed in-
congruous thatawoman with her ultra-
feminine traits could fulfill a
rnasculine—oriented position.

“It was not that women were in-
capable of holding authoritative posi-
tions, but society, contrary to their
believed-to-be liberal views, had not
yet come to accept women in the cor-
porate ﬁeld,” said the Pitt professor.
“The prejudices that had sex-typed
women were still too ﬁrmly etched in
society's mind and had made it difﬁcult
for women to step out of roles tradi-
tionally assigned to them — roles such
as nursing, teaching or homemalcing.”

But despite recognizing these same
prejudices, the professor admitted that
he was nonetheless victim to them
himself. “With students in my own
class, I usually take males more
seriously. Women are bright and
diligent, but upon graduation, most get
married and are supported primarily by
their husbands. And usually it was the
attractive women who had no trouble
ﬁnding husbands,” he said.

And as outdated as this professor
might appear, his prejudiced views are

shared even by young adults. Dr.
Thomas Cash, a psychologist at Old
Dominion University in Virginia, con-
ducted a study which asked college
freshmen to rate essays written by other

college freshmen. Photographs of at- '

tractivemenandwomenwereanached
to each essay. The results concluded
that good looks paid off in higher
marksformemalthoughhighermarks

.werealsoawardedtoworncnwho

wrote about feminine topics. On

masculine topics, unattractive women.
scored considerably higher than the at-

tractive women. '

Dr. Irene Frieze, director of
women's studies at Pitt, differed in her
attitude that beauty could hurt an am-
bitious woman. “First of all, I think
that ‘attractive’ should be more clear-
ly deﬁned. If you are speaking about
someone who is just above average in
looks, as opposed to the extreme of a
real beauty, I think that being attrac-
tive will give a woman an edge in the
corporate ﬁeld, considering that she has
the proper qualiﬁcations.

“To tell the truth," Frieze said, “the
most successful executives would
possess qualities that are inherent in
both men and women. Whether they
act emotionally or objectively should
depend on the matter at hand. The
‘masculine,’ objective method is not
necessarily going to be the best wayto
handle a situation. Ifthe male or female
executive is wise, they will be aware
of this.”

In support of Frieze’s androgynous
conclusion, it was proposed by the
psychologist Schein that subordinates
feel most satisﬁed and evaluate leaders
favorably when the actions of these
leaders are congruent with their sex
role stereotypes, whether they are male
or female.

But these subordinates also felt that
women were more accessible to up-
ward communication, whereas male
leaders were more effective in com-
municating information downward.
Although it has been demonstrated that
the managerial stereotype has more in
common ‘with the male stereotype,
Schein’s ﬁndings exemplify value in
each of the individual stereotypes.

Q. Dr. Posvar, students today
seem to be more job-oriented than
when you were named chancellor
at Pitt in 1967. How and why do
youthink students’ opinions have
changed since that time?

A. Well, I think we have come
full circle in, say, the last 30 years.

— In the 1950s, I think there was a
very conservative attitude among
students interested in careers and
business. Then we went through the
cycle of protest and insecurity in the
late ’60s and through much of the
’70s, which was associated to a
great extent with Vietnam. But
Vietnam wasnot the central factor,
because the same mood spread over
East Asia and Europe, who were

not involved in Vietnam. In the last
seven or eight years, I would say
our students have become very

. responsible, mature and interested

incareers and the substantial parts
of education, and I ﬁnd them to be
a very wholesome group of people.
group of people.

Q. Do you think this situation
may be changing, in light of the re-
cent anti-apartheid protest that was
held outside the William Pitt
Union? '

A. The matter of apartheid is one
in which there is literally 100 per-
cent agreement. Everyone is
strongly opposed to apartheid, at
least responsible Americans, facul-
ty and students, but the differences
are very complicated, and they
have to do with means of dealing
with South Aﬁica. There's a great

frustration there, to the extent that
divestment is useful, divestment is
not, economic sanctions are and so
on. The disagreement is only about
means, none of which are very ef-
fective in dealing with the real
problems of apartheid anyhow. I do
not see in our society or in the
university the divisiveness that ex-
isted when there was a corps of
people who really wanted to
destroy institunons, who wanted to
destroy governments and univer-
sities and the system.

Q. Concerning university divest-
ment, Columbia University an-

' nounced Monday that they had a

plan to divest $39 million from
companies doing business in South '
Africa over a period of two years.
The Columbia administration said
that student protests had no effect
on their decision. Do you think
student protests at Pitt will have any
effect on the decision to review
university policy on divestment?

POSVEII‘: Student activism in 1985 has run full circle

A. I think that student opinions,
however they are expressed, is
something that we do pay attention
to, and I’m—sure they did at Colum-
bia. Bear in mind that Columbia so
far is the only Ivy League school
to have taken this step, and all of
the others still maintain the strong
argument that selective divestment
and pushing the Sullivan Principles
are the responsible way to go. Co-
lumbia itself may have been under
pressure or had factions within its
own board of trustees, and I think
that's very likely where that deci-
sion came about. .

Q. Are there any factions within
Pitt's board of trustees pushing for
divestment?

A. I-think there are, although I
can’t begin to estimate or speak for
them, but I think that there are
several trustees who would argue

that the symbolic value of total
divestment is very great, that it
transcends the issue of whether or
not selective divestment is harmful
to blacks. It's clear that our invest-
ment committee and the majority of
our board feel that strong pressure
on the Sullivan Principles and our
policy of aggressive selective
divestment is, at this time, the
responsible way to go. »

Q. The point has been raised that
the university doesn't want to sever
its ties with corporations within the
Pittsburgh community, such as
U.S. Steel, who have invested in
companies in South Africa.

A. We don’t want to sever our
ties with corporations that are
ﬁghting apartheid. We do not want
to sever our ties with corporations
that are not ﬁghting apartheid,
whether here in Pittsburgh or
anywhere else.

Dr. Madeline Heilman, a New York
University psychologist. proved in yet
another study how attractive women
were regarded as less capable. Over
100 working men and women were
given detailed resumes with attached
photographs. The resumes were
similar, though the photos varied with
unattractive or attractive men and
women.

Participants in the study were asked
to indicate the factors such as hard
work, ability and luck in the ex-

ecutives’ success. The attractive men

and unattractive women, again, were
rated best.

‘ ‘Simply put,” the study concluded,
“attractive women were most often
believed to have gotten where they
were for reasons other than skill or
talent ” '

RaeLyn Marburger, a senior who
more resembles Brooke Shields than
the stereotyped chemical engineer,
found that being in a male-dominated
ﬁeld such as engineering was often
frustrating.

“It’s bad enough being a woman
engineer,” said Marburger, “but since
many women in this ﬁeld are not two-
headed monsters with thick glasses, it

guess that sometimes" the sexist prob-
lem gets really out of hand.

Marburger went on to say that the

problem was controlled at times: “At -

one of my summer jobs at a company
in New Mexico, if a male coworker
even slightly  the fact that
you were female by merely saying,
‘Nice jeans!"he was ﬁred on the spot.
Rules like that may sound unrealistic
or extreme, but they really were
necessary to remind men that the
women were not there for decoration,”
Marburger added.

Mr. Ben Cappiello, vice president in

charge of personnel for Pan American V

Airlines in New’ York, agreed that at-
tractive women at the managerial or ex-

ecutive levels were constantly being

questioned ability-wise.

' “ “Yet when her credibility has been
proven,” said Cappiello, “then the
woman is often labeled aggressive,
unfeminine and manipulating. It is a
catch-22 predicament.

“Men are probably intimidated, as
it is an unspoken blow to their egos to
see women in a position of equal or
greater importance. Personally, I try to
look at each applicant based on merit
and qualiﬁcation instead of as man or
woman, attractive or unattractive,”
said Cappiello. “Perhaps with time,
people will get used to seeing women
in managerial settings and not judge
their performances by their physical at-
tributes.”

In the meantime, however, women
possessing looks, brains and ambition

V will continue to be undermined as their

attractiveness is mistaken for ultra-
femininity. But this does not mean that
the corporate woman should strive to
appear unattractive, nor should she
dress in masculine suits.

succeed as women,” said Heilrnan,

University-civic orchestra opens with variety and enthusiasm

Kypros Markou, the 41-year-old
conductor of Pitt's University Civic
Orchestra, is enthusiastic about tomor-
row evening. Markou and about 50 stu-
dent, faculty and community members
of the orchestra will open their ninth
season.

‘ ‘Last year these people knocked me
over with their enthusiasm for music, ’ ’
said Markou, who joined the orchestra
last January D‘ ‘Thesepeople volunteer
and play with such spirit. They really
love music. It's true, they aren't pro-
fessionals, but they do have a good
understanding of music, ’ ’ said
Markou, who also recently substituted
as a conductor for the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony’s series of children’s concerts.

In addition to Thursday night’s per-

formance, the orchestra will perform A

fresh sound. Unlike professional orchestras which play
pieces over and over again, they approach each season
with such enthusiasm, and that is communicated to the

audience. ’ ’

and will feature student soloist Paul

in D Minor.

The orchestra, which was establish-
ed in 1976, is subsidized by the univer-
sity. Students, faculty and staff are ad-
mitted free, and general admission is
on a donation basis. Markou is hoping

“The idea is that you go to see your
own,” Markou said. “This is the or-
chestra of the university, just as the
Panthers are the football team of the
university. You root for your own.”
. Markou said he hopes to see more
than just increased zeal from the au-

too, they give a good violinist money

' to go to that school and play for the

orchestra.

But what makes this orchestra en-
dure. from season to season is its
dedicated and diverse members. “We
have a surgeon, a dental student,
retired people, housewives,” said
Markou. “The idea is that this is an
amateur orchestra composed of
students, people who work or teach at
the university and members from the
community at large.

“When these pepople come together,
they produce a fresh sound. Unlike
professional orchestras which play
pieces over and over again, they ap-
proach each season with such en-
thusiasm, and that is communicated to
the audience.”

“There is something thrilling about

playing in an orchestra, ’ ’ stated cellist

with the Department of "Anatomy. and
Neuroscience. “When you get 50 or
60 people together, they can make quite
a sound. The magic and the thrill is
when you have a number of different
people who see things differently, who
interpret music differently, yet they
make one sound.”

“I rejoined the orchestra with the
mention of Kypros’ name,” stated
Ruth Eisener, cellist and housewife
whose husband also plays with the or-
chestra. “This requires a sacriﬁce of
time and energy, and I’m never free,
with babysitting my grandson and the
housework,” Eisener said.

“I’m usually tired for Monday night '‘

rehearsals. But my whole family and
I love music and orchestra playing. I
wouldn't push myself if it weren’t
worth it. And Kypros, well, Ithink he’s
tops.”

Big-time football and basketball
have already arrived at Pitt with

Add volleyball to that list as of

be showcased tomorrow night at the
Fitzgerald Field House in the Pitt
Classic.. > _
The United State's and Japan’s
«V women’s national volleyball teams
will be featured at 8:30 p.m. Thurs-I
day as the two powerhouses will
play an exhibition match, follow-
ing a Pitt-Providence Big East
‘matchup.

The US. National Team. won the
silver medal in the 1984 Summer
Olympics, while Japan earned the
bronze. . _ i

The preliminary, which starts at
6:45 p.m. , should also be quite ex-
citing as the 18-5 Lady Panthers,
who won the Big East Champion-
ship last season, take the court
against ' conference runner-up,
Providence.

It will be the National teams,
though, who will display volleyball
talent Pittsburgh has never seen
before.

‘ ‘This is a chance to see some of

the best in the world,” Pitt Coach
Shelton Collier said. ‘ ‘It’s going to
be a big event. Already we have
3,000 tickets sold, and we are hop-
ing for 5,000 at game time. Maybe
the place will even sell out.”

“It will be areally good mate ,”
said Jayne McHugh, a member of
the U.S. national team. “The teams
are a lot different from one another.

The U.S. is a big powerful team
that is strong at the net. Japan is
more of a ﬁnesse team. -They have
great ball control and make very
few errors.” .

The Pitt Classic will be the ﬁrst
match between U.S. and Japan in
a seven-city, nine-day tour. The
U.S. beat Japan. three consecutive
times in July.

The Lady Panthers tennis team,

__having guaranteed themselves a win-

ning record this season, will go for
some icing on the cake this after-

The Mountaineers are 9-0 in dual-

' match play and feature the play of

By no means, however, is this
team ready for Olympic play in
1988, according to McHugh. With

1 no players returning from the 1984
silver medal team and a new coach
at, the helm, the team has a lot of
hard work ahead of them to com-
pete at a national level. ‘ _

‘ ‘Some of us have been together
since February, the other half only
since June,” McHugh said. “A lot
of people have been surprised over
how well we’ve played together
thus far, but we still have a lot to
accomplish. -

“The coaching staff has really
been working hard,” McHug_h said
of new head coach Terry
Liskevych, who tutored McHugh at
Paciﬁc University.

Liskevych also coached Collier
at Ohio State, helping him become
an All-America in the process.

The U.S. squad is a corporate-
funded team that is made up of 14
players. The training center will
provide from 12 to 15 players, but
only 12 are allowed on Olympic
rosters. And, with the possibility of
new talent being brought in, each
girl realized they must give their
best effort every game.

“Nothing is being taken for
granted,” McHugh said. “We
want to be around until 1988, but
the ﬁnal decisions are up to the
coaching staff. .We are worrying
about maturing as a team/Right
now, every match is important.”

After this tour, the team will head
back to team headquarters in San
- Diego to train hard for the World
Cup which will be held in Tokyo
in November. After the World
Cup, the team will play in the

' World Championships in Paris.

‘ ‘This is the last competitive tour
of the year for us,” McHugh said. ,
‘ ‘We're a brand new team and we'll
have to be at our best every night
"to compete with a team astalented
as the Japanese.” ‘

The U.S. squad may be anew
team, but they still are among the
best in the world. Thursday, they
will show Pittsburgh how volleyball
can be played just shy of perfection.

Charleston, W.Va. Despite having a
string of victories ‘over the Lady
Panthers, Mountaineer coach Mar-
tha Thorn takes them one at a time.

“I don’t know what to expect from

_Pitt,” Thorn said of this year's

squad.‘“I don’t take-them lightly,
that’s for sure.” ~ '

When asked about any particular

The Pitt’-News"-" oct'ob‘e'r'1'6;’ 1‘9'§5

Athlete of the Week

This week's Pitt News Athlete of
the Week award goes to junior out-
side hitter Kris Wexell of the
women's volleyball team. The 5-4
Wexell is a Norwin High School
graduate and was an honorable
mention choice for last week's ath-
lete of the week.

  
   

Wexell garnered the award this
week on the strength of ‘her 'perIor-
mance against Bowling Greenilast

_ Saturday. She served for over one
third of the Lady Panthers’ points,
leading the team to a 3-0 Homecom-
ing win.

“I think she is beginning to assert
herself a little bit, and I don’t think
Kris knew exactly where she was
going to stand on this year's team
with all these talented new players
coming in,” said head coach Shelton
Collier. “I told Kris at the beginning
of the year that I am one of her
biggest fans because she is my kind
of player. She plays hard, she plays
with intensity, and she is a winner."

Wexell is the main cog in Collier’s
complicated serve and receiving .
patterns. She rarely makes a mistake ,
in receiving serves which is the most
difficult skill to master in volleyball.
‘She is so good at receiving serves
that other teams have begun to serve

away from her. Opposing teams try
to place serves around her, and as a
result the serves come a bit easier. It
could be compared to a football

’ team kicking away from a player

who is a great kick returner.

“I would rate Kris as perhaps the
best serve receiver in the history of
Pitt’s volleyball program," said Col-
lier. “She is very good and very
steady. When the other team is serv-
ing and Kris is in the match, its diffi-
cult for them to score points."

The Pitt women's volleyball team
began the season ranked No. 18
nationally but lost their spot on the
polls after some early losses. But

' lately they have been on a roll and

will go into three tough matches this
weekend with an 18-5 record. They
will host Big East runner-up Provi-
dence on Thursday night, then Penn
State on Friday and Georgetown on
Saturday. This weekend could set
the tone for the remainder of the
season, and Collier is expecting a big
contribution from Wexell.

“I’m confident that this will be at
great weekend for Kris,” said Col-
lier. “With all of the young players

we have, Kris is a real stabilizing ’

I J‘...
.‘;

 

factor on our team. We need to have ,

her in the match just to keep things
stable because she never makes mis-
takes and she is emotionally consis-
tent. As a result, that rubs off on the
team. We need that."

Honorable mention: Bill Sapio ——
The senior defensive end on the foot-
ball team had 10 tackles (five
unassisted, one for a loss) as he gar-
nered ECAC Defensive Player of the
Week honors. Sapio was all over the
field as he had one interception and
also broke up a pass.

Carrie DeVera —- The sophomore.
from Elizabeth-Forward has an 8-3
record so far this year. She led the
Lady Panthers to a victory over
West Liberty last weekend.

Lori Wood — Wood, from Sau-
gerties, N.Y. finished first for the
third time this season at Fairmont
State last weekend. She covered the
5,000-meter course in 18:55.

By Bob Travers

Toronto Blue Jays all the Way

I’ve been watching the National and
American League Championship series

, this past week, and I have, after much

deliberation, come to the conclusion
that I want the Toronto Blue Jays to win
the World Series.

This is for a number of reasons.

I want to see the Blue Jays’ owner
call Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney “Hosehead” when
Mulroney makes the traditional con-
gratulatory call to the winners’ dress-
ing room. Will Mulroney tell the Jays’
manager Bobby Cox to “Take off,
eh?” That remains to be seen.

I also want to see, instead of cham-
pagne in the winners’ dressing room,
a case of Molson’s or Labbatt_s_ beer.

If the Blue Jays even make the
series, I’ll get to hear beautiful “Oh,
Canada,” the Canadian national an-
them, more often. I think it’s a much

nicer song than the rugged “Star-
Spangled Banner.” _

I also want to see the “Revenge of
the seagull,” No.’ it’s not a new
Stephen Eng movie, it’s the seagulls
of Lake Ontario getting their revenge
on major-league baseball players. The A

gulls have been after the players ever
since Dave Winﬁeld of the Yankees
gunned one down with a throw from
the outﬁeld a couple of years ago. I
think the seagulls have secretly been
plotting their revenge. Now comes the
payback on national TV. I think it will
come in the third inning of the second
game.

I do not want to see Steve Balboni,
the Royals’ ﬁist baseman, in the World
Series. He reminds me of a grouchy
Muppet from Sesame Street.

One other thing I do not want to see,

 

Ohio pivot player

Pitt basketball head coach Roy Chip-
man announced that he has received a
verbal commitment from Herbie Bar-
(1101, a 6-I 1, 225-lb. center from Nor-
mandy High School in Patina‘, Ohio.
Bartliol may turn out to be the big man
that Chipman has been looking for.

‘_‘He’s a horse,” said an enthusiastic
Chipman yesterday. “He’s going to get
bigger. He just turned 17 years 01 .”

Pitt basketball enthusiasts have seen

their share of horses that never even got

out of the stable, but that may not be
the case here. Barthol averaged 13.8
points, 12 rebounds and four blocks per
gamelastyearas ajunior. He maytum
outtobethedominating centerPitthas.
been missing the last,few years. If there
was any glaring weakness in the Pitt
attack last year, it was the center or
perhaps the lack of one.

"‘I think he’s a good player,” Chip-
man said. “Who knows? He’s still a
baby. He’s only 17 years old. I would

NFL Roundup

and will happily not have to put up with
if the Blue Jays win, is that stupid
ceremony in the White House Rose
Garden where the president stands
around ﬂanked by the members of the
team that won. I hate those things. I’ve
never seen one from the House of
Parliament in Ottawa. It could be
different.

I like baseball played in the snow.
Especially if I’m watching the game
from inside.

A Blue Jays win will help ease the
pain of Toronto sports fans who have
to suffer through another long winter
of watching their beloved Maple Leafs
struggle in the cellar of the Adams
Division. ‘

I like Blue Jays outﬁelder Jesse Bar-
ﬁeld. I think he is one of the  young
players in the game. I also hke his
name. Say it slowly to yourself: Jes-
se Bar-ﬁeld. Wasn’t that fun?

I don't like the Royals, Cardinals or
Dodgers in the least. I wanted another
subway series. Maybe next year.
Until then, everybody sing along1 .
“Oh, Canada, we stand on guard for
thee ...”

Chipman gets commitment from

guess on paper right now, he looks like
he could be the answer for us.”

After this season, Chipman loses
Matt Miklasevich, a player who has
seen some action in the middle, and
Keith Armstrong, last year’s starter, t0
graduation. Tico Cooper, this year’s
starter, will be gone in two years.

Barthol’s commitment will not
become binding until he signs a na-
tional letter of intent. He is_ expected
to sign during the early signing period
from Nov. 13 to 20.

Steelers start to resemble

“We had a few IOU’s out there
from last year, ” said Bear safety Gary
Fencik, referring to his team’s victory
over the San Francisco 49ers in a
rematch of last year’s NFC Champion-
ship. Chicago, 26-10 winners, irri-
pressively dominated the erratic 49ers,
holding them to 183 total yards offense
while gaining 372 ‘of their own. With
the game all but won, Chicago coach

. Mike Ditka decided to dish out some

last-minute punishment to the San
Francisco defense by having 325-lb.
nose tackle William Perry run the
football. ,

The week's biggest upset came
out of Philadelphia, where the
redeemed Ron Jaworski led his
Eagles to a 30-7 thrashing of the
Cardinals. Jaworski, who was
benched after the season opener in
favor’ of rookie Randall Cun-
ningham, won back the starting job

after two solid relief ‘performances. _

The Eagles held the Cardinals’ fiery
offense to 268 net yards, far below
their season average. On ‘the other
side of the field, what’s happened to
St. Louis?

The Dallas Cowboys extended,
their winning streak to four games
with a hard-unearned victory over

'the Pittsburgh Maulers. The Maul-

ers exploded for 13 points and 82
yards ‘rushing against one of the
league’s better defenses. Quarter-
back David Woodley relieved
Mauler starter Mark Malone in the A
third quarter and proved that he is
also bad enough for the starting job.
Woodley was able to complete an
astounding. nine , passes in 23
attempts, three of them elegantly
placed into the hands of Cowboy
-defenders.

The Cleveland Browns have won
two consecutive games behind quar-
terback Bernie Kosar.'On Sunday,
the ace rookie from Miami passed '
for 208 yards and one touchdown in
the Browns’ 21-6-victory over the
bumbling Houston Oilers. Kosar,
substituting for the injured Gary
Danielson, may never see the bench
again if the Browns continueitheir
winning ways. '

No sooner said than done. San

Diego recently fired defensive coor-"_

Maulers

dinator Torn Bass in an effort to
improve the team’s defensive play,
currently ranked last in the NFL. He
was replaced by Charger assistant
Dave Adolph. Someone in San
Diego must have been reading this
column.

Tampa Bay fans, don’t lose
heart. When Steve Young takes over
as quarterback, your 0-6 team will
start winning games. Buffalo fans,
well, you could always hop on the
Chicago bandwagon.

- Journeyman quarterback Mark
Herrmann of the San Diego
Chargers may finally have found a
home. In his last two starts relieving
for the injured incumbent Dan
Fouts, the ex-Purdue star has com-
pleted 73 percent of his passes for
664‘ yards and five touchdowns.

Here’s an early nomination for
Rookie of the Year: Jerry Rice, wide
receiver of the San Francisco 49ers.
Rice has sparkled in every game this
season, and is taking a great deal of
the receiving burden (and publicity)
from his teammate, All-Pro Dwight
Clark. L A
