 TAs, TF5 Pay Demands

Overlooked, PPU Says

BY DAVE KIRSHNER

Last summer’s demand by Pitt’s
graduate student employees for a
$1,000-a-year increase has not
been met, according to Pitt
Professional Union (PPU) spokes-
man Robert Nelson.

Following a demonstration by’

members of the PPU last June,
Provost Rhoten A. Smit issued a
_ letter to the PPU statin that the

-as present ﬁve per cent increase given

4:)’ all University faculty would
apply to all teaching assistants,
teaching fellows and graduate
student assistants.

Nelson, however, explained that
this increase is not sufficient for
graduate student employes.

“Rapid rises in the cost of living
such as occur- in periods of
economic depression affect the
lowest income brackets most
“I am
sure that the ﬁve per cent increase
as applied to faculty does not offset
their losses in real buying power,
however, the situation for graduate
employes is worse since we’re

‘£7’?/vorking on a lower base salary.”
 Assistant to the Provost Rayford

Steele contended that while the
University is sympathetic with the
PPU’s demands, the increase
requested is impossible to meet.

“They're asking for a 28%
increase,” said Steele, “and it’s
just not feasible.”

Currently, Pitt’s 900 graduate
student employes, who teach
undergraduate students and do
research, receive $3,000 a year.

According to Nelson, the $1,000
raise would help achieve a salary
level established 3 years ago.

“The increase of 3.8 % or even
5% is woefully inadequate when

t the cost of living over the same
’ ‘ period

is up 28.8%,” Nelson
commented. _ .

A secondary issue involving
graduate student researchers
,(GSRs), who have received no
increase in salary, also remained
unsolved.

“No increase for GSRs is a

disgrace,” Nelson said. However

 

SNATCH! It’s frisbee time again on the lawns of the Cathedral,

Steele argues that ‘this problem
does not lie in the hands of the
University since GSRs are paid
through a granting board, which is
separate from the University.

“In the next six months,”
Nelson said, “it is highly probable
that faculty, graduate employes
and University staff will be voting
in a collective bargaining election.
The only way this exploitation of

. University employes will stop is if

that collective bargaining election
is won by the PPU.”

The P_PU, Nelson said, sent a
letter to the Provost concerning the
issue, but it has not received a
response.

Provost Rhoten Smith has been
on vacation recently, according to
Steele, but he will respond
personally to the PPU when he
returns.

“We are willing to sit down and
talk this thing out,” Steele said.
“But communicating on the matter
in this way is getting us nowhere.”

What Price Football Tickets?

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

It looks as though Pitt students
may be paying to get into home
football games next season, follow-
ing the tempo of recent events
involying the new coupon exchange,
system.

First, the proposed system, with
its’ complex schedules, matrices
and rules, is admittedly only an
interim step toward a perfect
method of admitting students to
games. _

“At best this system is far from
perfect,” Assistant to the Chancel-
lor Edward Bozik said at last
week’s Student Affairs Advisory
Committee (SAAC) meeting.
“We’ll d ﬁnite] b k‘ t ‘

hordes. Certainly a fine way of submerging the fears of mid-terms to

improve and revise it.”

Under the present plan for the
coupon exchange system, which
goes into effect this season,
students don’t have to pay to get
into games, but under student
questioning, Bozik acknowledged
the fact that a plan requiring
students to pay to get into home
games would be considered next
year.

“Students will not pay this
year,” said Bozik, “but next year
that possibility will be consid-
ered.” .. '

The system, as it stands, also
seems to be full of multitudinous

problems. For certain games, the

few thousand students who hold
ticket books with colors of last
priority run the risk of being shut
out of the stadium. Students with
the wrong colors for the Po ‘in State
and Notre Dame games unavoid-
ably will be turned away.

Students who hold tickets, but
who do not want to watch games,
can easily scalp either their tickets
or even their coupon books for a
good deal of cash under the new
system. b

Irate students, turned away from
ticket exchange poin _ - in the
Student Union or Cathedral, can
easily create the kind "of violent
disturbances University adminis-
trators say they’re striving to avoid
at the stadium by implementing the
system.

Friends who usually sit together
at football games, face the
possibility of being shut out of
different games than their fellows.

Date tickets have been elimin-
ated.

Assistant Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs William Markus,
who drew up the original plans for
the coupon exchange system-, said
problems of this sort would be
unavoidable under almost any new
system. ‘ 7

“You can nitpick the plan all you
want and ﬁnd 101- ‘problems with

it,” said Markus, “but we can
easily shift the system around to
accomodate most of your (student)
objections . ’ ’ '

All University officials present at
the SAAC meeting seemed to agree
with Markus.

Athletic Director Casimir Mys-
linski said he wanted to see
students admitted to the games as‘
easily as possible, “but,” he
added, “with increased student
interest in the football team, a new
system should be developed.”

Student Apathy Disturlosén.

Several Campus Leaders-

BY BOB MAYO

The apathetic attitudes and
preoccupation with economic sur-
vival by Pitt students dissatisﬁes
several campus leaders.

The dissatisfaction was express-
ed in response to the ﬁndings of a
Pitt News survey indicating that
36% of the student body was
undecided what issue it viewed as
most important, and the only other
responses of a significant number
centered on economic issues.

“I’m personally fearful concern-
ing what‘ has happened,” said
College Young Republicans Presi-
dent Phil Davis.

“These attitudes are some of
those that existed in pre-Hitler
Germany. People felt government
couldn’t do anything for them.”

Betty Nelson, executive director
of the College Young Democrats,
also voiced concern over the
change in student priorities.

Chancellor Posvar called the
situation a “problem of good
times,” which other schools like
Pittjhave been dealing with for
decades--namely, that more stu-
dents want to get into home games
than can be accommodated.

Both Posvar and Vice Chancellor
of Student Affairs Alfred Moye

It looks as though the adminis-
tration is resigned to falling back
on the pay or exchange ticket
programs drafted by other schools.

When the ﬁnal decision is
reached M the ,.act kind of coupon
ex",_, .sv system to be used, no
one speciﬁc department or admin-
istrator seems to be i , a position to
take either the praise or catcalls for
it.

Vice Chancellor Moye, who
seems to be ' taking tentative
charge, must rely heavily on his
assistant Markus, who in turn is
answerable to assistant Bozik and
Posvar himself. The. Athletic

Department under Myslinski also
will have much to say on "the
matter. .

Should the new system prove to
be a bad egg, this network
planning would prevent students
from focusing their criticisms and
attacks on one responsible party.

Some student leaders opposed to
the coupon exchange system also
have said that the added red tape
and waiting in line brought about
by implementation of the plan
would frustrate most students to
the point where they would gladly
pay a dollar or two to get into the
games next year.

This comment was made by. a

Inﬂation was cited as having

Tuition and clothes are becoming

said Pam Eddy, a political science
major. Freshman Judy Vincenti
also noted the increase in the price

Davis agreed with Nelson and
added that he felt the attitude was
shocking.

“It shows a real lack of interest.
But I can understand why it is so.‘
People don’t take an interest in
why things are so. Try. If you
don’t become involved now, you’re
not going to later.

“Most of us hope we’ll be
around 30 years from now. What’s
the world going to be like 30 years
from now for our children and
grand children?”

Nelson added, “Students have
lost the ability to look outside the
sphere of their own happenings.

That’s the trend across the country. -

People are not concerned with
anything that doesn’t affect them
as individuals.

“It can be blamed on Watergate
and disillusionment with political
ﬁgures. It goes even further than
college campuses. God help you if

' you buy a car that was built on a

Monday or a Friday.”

Nelson implied it was a similar
casewith students. “They’re not
bored but they ﬁgure what’s the
use?”

Davis and Nelson reported that
their memberships, though per-
hapsin some cases declining, will
experience an upswing with the
approaching presidential elections.
One commented, “Though there
are a smaller number now, they are
more experienced and willing to
work; they are of a higher caliber
than the people in 1970.”

Davis then added, “It takes
some strong interest in politics now
because people -put you down.”

Nelson agreed, “People say,
‘Oh, you want to be a crook like
Nixon.’ I see some people in

politics not of the caliber they
should be, but there are some
holding seats in the House that
were involved in social concerns in
the seventies. They’re politicians,
but cannot be compared to Nixon
and his palace guard. Not by any
comparison.’ ’

Nelson then added, “It scares
me where people’s heads are at.
They are worried about clothes
rather than things like hunger and
poverty. I’ve got news for you--the

economy is not going to change.,r..Q-..

Pittsburgh was one of the last areasr
to be hit, and it’ll be one of the last
to recover.”

It's the middle class that’s been
hit by this crunch, Nelson said. It
makes sense that people aren’t
concerned. They haven’t sat down
and looked at the situation. They
can analyze it in class, ‘but they
don’t apply the classroom know-
ledge to the real world. ‘

When asked for his reaction to
the survey and the student
attitudes, Student Government
Board President Larry Platt said,
“There has been a three-to-ﬁve-
year gap between the height of
student involvement in the war

- ,

protests and the present time. Itigé-5;-,.‘

the ﬁrst time since then that‘
students see issues directly affect-
ing them: tuition and the spiraling
cost of higher education.

“If it continues to spiral and the
rate of unemployment continues to
grow, students will ﬁnd out their
degree is not quite the return on
the investment they had planned.

“You’ll see more and more
demonstrations, and more and
more dissatisfaction but they are all
related to two basic issues: ‘I’ve
got to get a job and I’ve got to go to
school.’ "

actually a hierarchy, in the sense of
a business corporation, our pur-
pose is to support academic
activity, but not to control or direct
it," Posvar began.

“First of all, there can't really be
a‘ ‘top’ of an organizational chart,

because it would fail to show the

arrows and crossing lines of
authority and responsibility. But
the office of the chancellor is
primarily that of an academic
administrator.” ‘ .

Asked to elaborate on the work of
an administrator, Posvar ticked off
still more roles: initiator,
spokesman, agent, sponsor, legis-
lator, diplomat, guide, educator,
adviser.

“It's a single office with a single I

man in charge, but it obviously

takes more than one person to’
administrate from it,” Posvar said.

“And so I have assistants, who try
to act as extensions of me.”

His assistants, in_ turn, also
loosely. define their responsibi-
lities. Dr. David Powers, the
chancellor’s shadow formally in

_ charge of academic affairs, insists,
“It would be improper for this

ofﬁce to try to solve everythi_ng that
comes before it. If we tried,
there’d be no need for 7,000
employees.” '

Whatever it is that the chancellor s

-does, his assistants do, too.’ ,
“We're here to make sure the
chancellor doesn’t_ get stretched by
people demanding his time and
presence. I'd say one half of our

total time is spent in conserving the 7

chancellor’s time,” Powers said;

The four assistants are not,
according to Knox, on the same
administrative level. Access to the
chancellor varies, although an)’
oneof them can and does meet with
Posvar on an immediate basis, with
need the prevailing factor.

“I have the leastaccess because
I have the least need,” Knox said.

“The fires don't get quite asshot on
this front." _

And while the fires burn on the
other three fronts, the.-real action,
Knox said, is with those lower in
the organizational chart.

“These guys do the playing--we
just run out with buckets and
towels," Knox said.

But the four water boys are
agreed: The chancellor runs his
own show.’

g r I Beat the Education Vote

‘ On September 9, Congress will attempt to override President Ford’s

' veto of a $7.9 billion education bill. The veto was the President's
" thirty-ﬁfth and the rationale behind the veto was, according to Ford,

. inﬂation. -

' As he signed the veto measlne, he was full of praise for education, ,

calling it “one of the strong foimdation stones of our Republic.” But

-then he went on, as most foes of modern learning do, calling for ﬁscal

restraint in practically the same breath. . I

_ ‘ What it all boils down to is an American president who regards

education with only casual concern at a time when many facets of the
learning scene either have come under_ﬁre for non-productivity or have
been rendered obsolete by lack of funding in the previous
administration. , _ I

’- American education is struggling between traditional concepts and
methods that pour A and B into students and come out with C (most of
the time) and innovative techniques that permit students to take in

A  whatever knowledge they like.

Somewhere in the middle, though, there is failure, and the question

' whether edticators should use newer or older methods is one that is

being hotly argued. If anything, education could. use some extra

' ﬁnancing to ﬁnd out which direction it should take in coming years,

over, and above the money it needs to ftmction from day to day.

7 Though the House of Representatives originally passed the bill by a
margin of 370-42 and the Senate passed it, 80-15, the President refused
to sign it despitepits across-the-board support. And although "the

‘ margins appear enough to override the veto. it has not been a very

predictable year for Congressional votes the second time around.

At stake in the bill is $715 million in Basic Grants, used by many
students to help fund their post-secondary education, and $322 million
in National Student Defense Loans. There are many more provisions in

* 2 danger. too many to list here. , —

; As the National Student Lobby (NSL) points out, students from

that thousands ofstudentsacrosstlrecountrywillbeforcedbutof

How much more can education take‘?
Only a major shift in national -priorities would easily remedy the

' situation. Though that is doubtful in light of Ford's determination to

fund some parts of the budget exorbitantly while others must suffer.
we can atleast hope for an override that will temporarily stave off any
drastic cuts for next year. ‘~ 5 ’

So Wheres Your Sheepskin?

BY CAL RITCHEY

On August 13, 1975, the agony
and the ecstasy was finally done: I
had finished the last two credits
needed for my BA in English. My
undergraduate career was forever
over. .
Of course, I knew, through
inquiry, that I wouldn’t, actually
receive official notification of my
degree until sometime in October.
The Registrar’s office did say,
however, that if I ran into a
skeptical employer who wanted
proof of my education, the
Registrar would send a certified
letter directly to the employer.
Well, I thought, I can’t see why it
takes so long, but I’m used to Pitt’s
ways by now. 'Que Sera, sera.

And then: on August 21-, 1975, I
opened my mailbox to find a Pitt

The Cal Ritchey article in the Pitt

numerous errors concerning blue-

WRONG. Neither carpenters.
nor plumbers ever achieve senior-
ity or job security. The oldest,
most experienced journeyman is
entitled to no more consideration
than the one who completed his
apprenticeship yesterday. Tenure
and other forms of job protection
are non,-existent;~ either can be
fired on the spot for incompetence;
either can be laid off without -

same lack of regard for seniority,
and the 300 currently unemployed

I read the second line:

future students better by sharing

Pittsburgh with us. Would you

there are any comments you care to

signed by Marilyn K. Brown,
Director, Institutional Research.

If it is possible to obtain a listing

possible for the Registrar’s office to

So much for seniority and job
security.

To support his claim that
hard-hats may be making more
than mortar-boards,‘ Ritchey
claims “it is a fact that the national
average wage in the building
industry for 1972 was over
$15,300." “

,WRONG. According to US
Department of ‘Labor Statistics, the
national average hourly wage for
the building industry in 1972 was
$7.69, which if multiplied by 2,000
hours would result in an annual
wage‘ of $15,380. But anyone with
the slightest knowledge of con-
struction is well aware that the
industry does not work a 2,000 hour
year." Official union statistics
indicate that the average plumber
in Allegheny County was employed
for 1,200 hours in 1972, and thus
his annual income
considerably less thanithe $16,838
salary which Ritchey cites as the
1972 average for teaching faculty at
Pitt.

Union members receive no sick

For those who relish an exciting
election year and ﬁnd themselves
on the ropes of despair because of
what appears to be an impending
whitewash by Gerald Ford 15
months from now, take heart._

With 1976 shaping up to be a
repeat of 1972, most armchair
political strategists already have
lost interest before any of the
battles have had a chance to begin.
Though popular opinion sees the
next general election as a cakewalk
between the incumbent President

candidacy. Before being chosen by.

Agnew, Ford intended to retire

make the United States virtually
leaderless for another two years.

Ford’s sacrifice also is serving to
prop up the Republican party by
the projection of, the President as a
conservative with a somewhat
populist-following. All in all, the
President’s posing as a candidate is
an honorable one, which will come
to an end probably some time
between December and the sum-
mer primaries.

On the other side of the coin, the
Democrats are splintering them-
selves to death once again. This
year’s jockeying for position makes
'68 and '72 look like practice
sessions. The campaign began,_ as
usual, with Ted Kennedy’s refusal
to run. And then the roof caved in.

The right wing has Wallace,
Bentsen, Sanford and possibly
Byrd to look forward to; the left has
Udall, Harris, Shriver, McCarthy
and Bond; and the moderates have
Jackson, and eventually Hum-
phrey, Muskie and Bayh. '

Wallace is no longer the threat
he was held up to be, especially
since Bentsen and Sanford can
stand up to him in his own
backyard. And if Byrd indeed does
enter the the race, West Virginia,
Wallace’s stepping stone to the

Everyone has a place where he

“The Safest Place on Campus.”

We became interested in locat-

near Benedum Hall. As you know,
there are large cracks in the walls
of the building--designed by Pitt
engineering students and con-
structed in the 60’s,--it is sinking
slowly to the foot of Cardiac Hill,
and it is in “imminent danger of
collapse,” accordingto a a Bﬂtsk
spokesman.

For the same reasons, political
science students, whose depart-
ment headquarters are within
range of a falling Benedum Hall,
also must pay the big rates.
Fortunately, the book store is just
out of that range, or allstudents
would have been hard hit ﬁnan-
cially, that is). that is).

The Bﬂtsk Agency was inter-
ested merely in physical safety, but
we sought to determine the spot on
campus that is least susceptible to
troubles of all kinds--physical,
emotional, psychological and spiri-
tual.

For instance, the Cathedral of
Learning and most of the surround-

ing area was ruled out on several
grounds. The most dangerous
seems to.be.that good old CL is
rumored to be Zero Ground in the
event of a nuclear attack--that is,
it’s the target. It’s the spot where
the bomb has the largest chance of
inﬂicting the greatest damge. This
cancels out the factor that the
Cathedral is a bomb shelter.

Although this point becomes
moot when it is realized that most
of Monroeville would be destroyed
by the same bomb, it is nonetheless
interesting, and therefore germane
to our study, that the Cathedral
could someday be the site of an
explosion as powerful as the sun
(imagine the view from the Student
Union).

Any Pitt student worth his salt
knows that the Cathedral is the
tallest educational building in the

now that there’s been a major
shooting spree from the second
tallest educational building in the
world, there’s only one way some
maniacal tower shooter can get his

These are reasons that the area
is physically unsafe. The psychol-

Today, even so-called “non-technical” courses
(psych, soc, bus ad, to name 3) require a vari-
ety of technical calculations—complicated cal-
culations that become a whole lot easier when
you have a powerful pocket calculator.

Not surprisingly, there are quite a few such
calculators around, but ours stand apart, and

- ahead. We started it all when we introduced the-

world’s first scientific pocket calculator back in

1972, and we’ve shown the way ever since.
The calculators you see here are our newest,

the first of our second generation.Both offer you

’ technology you probably won’t find in compet-
itive calculators for some time to come, if ever. .

Our HP-21 performs all arithmetic, log and
trig calculations, including rectangular/ polar
conversions and common antilog evaluations.

It’s display is fully formatted, so you can choose
between fixed decimal and scientific notation.
Our HP-25 does all that—and much, much

_ more. It’s programmable, which means it can

solve automatically the countless repetitive
problems every science and engineering student
faces.

With an HP-25', you enter the "keystrokes
necessary to solve the problem only once.
Thereafter, youjust enter the variables and
press the Run/Stop key for an almost instant
answer accurate to,1O digits.

Before you invest in a lesser machine, by all
means do two things: ask your instructors
about the calculations their courses require; and
see for yourself how effortlessly our calculators
handle them.

Both the HP-21 and HP-25 are almost
certainly on display at your bookstpre. If not,

who has A

Least Safe Spot on Campus.”
[Some of these panel members
wouldn’t even make the trip up to
the station to judge it.] -

Many other areas were ruled out.

Traffic hazards on Forbes and
Fifth disqualiﬁed the Music Build-
ing, the Clapp Hall complex, David
Lawrence, the Stephen Foster
Memorial and some lesser-known
buildings. Construction in the
Forbes Field area eliminated it
from consideration. The possibility
of being whisked off the street and
forced to participate in mad-scient-
ist-type experiment (and no credit
for Psych 80) ruled out the whole
medical complex area.

Pitt Stadium, though sufficiently
walled off from the dangers of
campus l_ife, has no roof (and no
lights!) and is therefore exposed to
the elements. Hillman Library,
because of an’ incident this
summer, is ‘under consideration for
the “Rape Center of Campus.”
(Interestingly, the south wing of
the Alldred Reading was voted the
safest place in 1970.)

Trees Hall and Fitzgerald Field
House have several relatively

safe places, but the constant
physical activity (imagine getting
involved in a javelin catching
contest or accidentally wandering
into the wrong "end of the archery

room) clearly makes them more
hazardous than the real safest
place on campus.

That “safest place” is
basement of Heinz-Chapel. It’s
really an obvious choice. There can

be no doubt, for instance, that it is-

spiritually the safest place on
campus. It cannot be reached by
the falling Benedum Hall.

“Although it would be close to a

Cathedral sniper, no bullet could
reach the basement unless it took a

path more crooked than that of the .

famed single bullet of the “Single
Bullet Theory.”

As for harassment from other
people, forget it. It’s one of the
most deserted spots around. The
only people who show up--just a
few for the daily services--pretty
much stick to their own business
and always stay upstairs.

The choice of Heinz'Chapel even
has etymological roots. The
sanctuary, which is part of a
religious building and certainly of
Heinz Chapel, is a place where one
can find sanctuary. Long ago,
certain criminals could legally
“hole up” in a church without
being brought to justice.

As for the nuclear attack, a
basement is the safest place. And
if everything comes falling down
anyway, at least you’ll have the
House of God upon you.

Okay, ﬁlm fans, so you want to see movies but can’t afford the
' commercial theatre prices? .
You may never have to darken their doors again.
, The fall season is packed with cheap movies shown on or just off

campus that feature a dollar or less admission. And, noting that the
-_ best-cheapie is a freebie, the campus area offers plenty of those, too,
~_ 4' from the best of experimental and commercial films to enjoyable trash
0‘ to-flicks that will never risk an appearance on anyone’s ten best list.
. The best bargain is the A-V Film Festival, courtesy of Audio-Visual
3' Services. Most of the films have been rented for classroom use and
; others are in the University’s own collection.
A Note that some of the ﬁlms--ranging from genuine classics to
 “duds--are included in other ﬁlm series locally. The advantage here, of
' . course, is that all screenings are free and open to students, faculty and
1; staff. Program's start at 8 pm in G-8 of the Cathedral.

The General (Buster Keaton, 1926; based on an
actual event in the Civil War, this ﬁlm was voted
one of the “Twelve Best Comedy Films of All
Time” in an international poll in 1967)

A Trip to the Moon (Georges Melies, 1902; this
early science-ﬁction success laid the foundation
for the pre-WWI preeminence of French ﬁlms)

‘Julius Caesar (Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 1953;

Marlon Brando won the British Film Academy
Award for his portrayal of Mark Antony in this
ﬁlm of Shakespeare)

Conquest of the Pole (Georges Melies, 1912;
originally a box ofﬁce flop, the ﬁlm has grown
into a minor classic)

Lumiere Premiere Program (Ten..ﬁlms by Louis
Lumiere, 1895)

Entr’Acte (Rene Clair, 1924; this heavily dadaist
ﬁlm «has'“ been,—_. described as “delightfully

preposteroufsfl and “surely the masterpiece. of '

‘pure’ cinema’ ’)

Un Chien Andalou (Luis Bunuel, 1928; a general
theme of passionate revolt is told in surrealistic
symbols and metaphors)

Cabiria (Giovanni _Pastrone, 1914; this epic of the
Second Punic War introduced revolutionary
innovations, which later strongly inﬂuenced
Grifﬁth’s Babylonian sequences in Intolerance)

The Great Train Robbery (Edwin S. Porter, 1903;
first Western, ﬁrst American ﬁlm of importance,
ﬁrst big commercial ﬁlm success in this country)

-Dream of the Rarebit Fiend

A Man For All Seasons (Fred Zinnemann, 1966;
won Academy Awards for best picture, best
picture, best director, best actor for Paul
Scoﬁeld’s portrayal of Sir Thomas More, and
best cinematography for Ted Moore; a ﬁne, if
sometimes stagey, version of Robert Bolt’s play)

Lonedale Operator

Intolerance (D. W. Grifﬁth, 1916; this colossal,
sometimes extravagant ﬁlm fell short of box
ofﬁce expectations’, but remains stunning, if
sometimes confusing, expecially with the
frenetic cross-cutting)

The Last Laugh (F. W. Murnau, 1924; this
German ﬁlm dispensed with titles while making
the camera a more active character in the drama)

Strike (Sergei M. Eisenstein, 1924; the Russian
master’s ﬁrst ﬁlm, a rough sketch for his classic
The Battleship Potemkin)

Niebelungen; Part 1, Siegfried (Fritz Lang, 1924;
the old German Nibelungen legend is recounted
in a highly architectural style)

Ferdinand Zecca Program (A look at the career
of the commercially successful French director,
1864-1947) ‘

His Young Wife

Smiling Madame Beudet (Germaine Dulac,
1922; Dulac’s best ﬁlm tells the story of a roman-
tic woman who comes to dislike her dull
merchant husband, and fantasizes young lovers
and her mate's murder)

The Grapes of Wrath (John Ford, 1940; Ford’s
Academy Award-winning ﬁlm was one of
Hollywood’s ﬁrst and most successfullooks at in-
justice, and a fair cinematic adaptation of John
.Steinbeck’s novel)" .

Etoile De Mer"
Anemic Cinema

Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming, 1939, a
sentimental favorite, due to a ﬁne cast, pleasing
songs and a diehard nostalgia)

Fabiola

Viva Zapata! (Elia Kazan, 1952; written by John
Steinbeck, this often cold ﬁlm retells the theme
of hopeless revolutions and idealistic leaders
turning into tyrants; stars Marlon Brando)

Ballet Mecanique (Fernand Leger, 1924; the title
explains a ﬁlm of mechanical objects, displays
and similar unrelated bits of reality)

Chute de la Maison Usher (Fall of the House of
Usher) (Jean Epstein, 1928; combines the Poe‘

story of the title with another, “The Oval
Portrait,” for a dazzlingly cinematic mystery)

The Gold Rush (Charles Chaplin, 1925; very
probably Chaplin’s ﬁnest, most complete work,
in this tale of the 1898 Klondike gold rush)

The Informer (John Ford, 1935; a powerful story
of the 1922 Irish rebellion and a simple man who
turns traitor for money and sees his conscience
catch up with him more swiftly than his
pursuers)

How Green Was My Valley (John Ford, 1941; a
romanticized, but still often effective, tale of a
man remembering his childhood in Wales; won
several Academy Awards,
picture, direction, cinematography and art
direction; incidentally, it pushed aside Citizen
Kane for those awards that year)

Singin’ In The Rain (Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen,
1952; this ultimate Hollywood musical spoofs as
well as celebrates the genre)

All The King’s Men (Robert Rossen, 1949; the
Academy Award-winning expose of political cor-
ruption paralleled the infamous career of Huey
Long)

La Terra Trema (Luchino Visconti, 1948; a
powerful, neo-realistic film that was a
commercial disaster and may have suffered from
inept attempts to make it more palatable at the
box ofﬁce)

Umberto D (Vittorio de Sica, 1952; a tragedy of

- postwar Italy)

‘Pyramids’ , Mix \
Fact &' Fiction
With Ancient

BY CAL RITCHEY

Secrets of the Great Pyramids,
Peter Tompkins, Harper # Row,
New York, 382 pages, including an
afterword by Livie Catullo
Stecchini, $17.50. _

At $17.50, this isn't a book likely
to become common reading fare.
That’s unfortunate, because Tomp-
kins has provided many pages of
informative text on the Great
Pyramids of Egypt, though he also
delves into other ancient wonders
such as the Tower of Babylon,
Stonehenge and other minor
Egyptian pyramids.

Areheologists and armchair ex-
plorers, particularly those who
have mathematical ability beyond
the l+l=2 level of which I boast,
will enjoy following the explana-
tions sprinkled through the text.
However, those who have no
mathematical ability can read
Tompkins with serenity--he has
thoughtfully arranged his dialogue
so that it is not necessary to follow
the math.

Tompkins undertakes to prove
that the Great Pyramid at Giza
embodies, among other mathemat-
ical theorems, such advanced
formulas as the figure for pi, to two
places--and Tompkins admits, cir-
cuitiously, that because the pyra-
mid has suffered considerably from

. deterioration over the thousands of

years since it's construction, the
figure for pi thus obtained may
originally have been much more

precise.
More mysteriously, Tompkins
- devotes an entire chapter to

reporting some odd facts about the
pyramid that have come to light
recently, in one case as recently as
the late 19605. When a team of
scientists used cosmic rays to
‘map’ the Great Pyramid, they
hoped -to use the resultant data to
discover any heretofore undiscov-
Cred chambers.

But when the computerized
information was examined, the
sophisticated equipment had pro-
duced a series of unexplainable
results. According to Dr. Amr
Goneid, one of the team of
scientists, the experiment was a
failure, but for unknown reasons:
"It defies all known laws of
ph_\sics,” he said. 1

Another observer, Karel Drbal of
C"/echoslovakia. read a report by a

‘ 7‘-h'ad literally manhandled them in

1 From the opening kickoff of -the

Panthers were going to be more
‘sure of themselves. It started with
 the offensive line, which during the

Defensively the line began to
come off the ball better too. Nose
' guard Al Romano admitted to
getting beaten off the ball initially.
“We knew the first half we had
been getting beat by Georgia's
line," Romano said. “We hadn't
expected them to come off so fast.
" After we adjusted things began to
work better.”

learned from experience what to do
with a soggy football. ' _
“It was funny after I had fallen
on the ball in the end zone--the
Georgia players were all jumping
up and down yelling and smacking
each other. I got up and said to one
of them, ‘What are you’ so happy
about? I did that on purpose.’
After he thought about it he quit
yelling.” ' V
“When I saw that wet ball go
through Larry's legsl said, ‘Oh,
shoot,’ ” Majors said. “But after I
thought about it, I realized, hey,
that was a really smart play.”

Smart indeed, as it was the last *

time the Bulldogs would score on
the day.

Robert Haygood also showed a
lot of poise throughout the game.
In just ‘ his first start as a
quarterback--plus the fact he was
running an entirely new offense--
he guided the Pitt team throughout
the day, saving the best for last as.
the Cats ate up the clockplate in the
final period with a touchdown
march. _ V

Although many critics will say
Haygood kept the ball too long (he
carried 24 times), take into
consideration the difficulty of
operating the veer with precision
and conﬁdence. Georgia quarter-
backs Matt Robinson and Ray Goff
looked better on the day bpt then
the Bulldogs have used the veer for
two years and the experience
deﬁnitely could be seen.

Making up for their lack of
experience with "poise. the Pan-
thers came back from a 7-0 deﬁcit
in the second half to stop Georgia
in all phases of its offense and to
grab its initial win of the season.

When the experience does come
along, and taking for granted the
poise will remain, it seems logical
that the 1975 Panthers will be one
of the best football. teams in the
naﬁon.

ATHENS, Georgia The
“Dawgs” may have beenhungry in
the land of peaches but the
Panthers showed they had nerves
of steel as they defeated the
Georgia Bulldogs, 19-9, before a
sparse crowd of 38,000 Saturday.

The veer, which everyone had
counted on to put tons of points on
the board for Pitt, didn’t seem to
work until it was needed, and then
only when Tony “TD” Dorsett

Although he ran to the outside
only a few times, TD was virtually

Head Coach’Johnny Majors. “His

PHILADELPHIA--Penn State
Coach Joe Paterno is ever the
realist. -

‘‘I thought Temple dominated
the football game,” said Patemo

(after his Nittany Lions squeaked by.
the upset-minded Owls of Wayne
Hardin, 26-25, Saturday night.

The» statistics bore out Paterno’s
statement. .

Temple outgained the Lions 183
to 114 on the ground and
out-passed them 219- to 87.

“Yeh,” said Hardin, “but you
have to play football three ways;
offense, defense and kicking. And
unfortunately our kicking game let
us down.”

The stats showed Penn State
returned kicks for 297 yards, one
100 for a touchdown on a kickoff
return, and another a 66-yard punt
return in the fourth quarter that set
up the winning touchdown.

“Temple is an awfully ﬁne
football team,” said Paterno of the
product that Hardin’ has built in
just ﬁve years.
college Division Two team when
Hardin took over, and not a good
one.‘ Now they're in Division One
and knocking at the door of the big
bovs. ’

“They (Temple) played defense
beter than I expected,” Paterno
said. “They executed better than
we did early. They hustled, hit
hard and cameoff the ball well.

We didn’t move the ball much.” '

But this was just an opener. and
Penn State football teams always
start slowly and build into monsters
by November.

Paterno was asked, “ls this
better or worse than other openers
of recent vintage?” .

“I don’t know,” Patemo said.

“Last year we had to come back
against Stanford. But there was.a
lot of circumstance this time, our
injuries, the emotion of the game. I

don't want to take anything from"

Temple. They played well."

The motion. of course, was that"

this was the biggest game in
Temple football history.' Hardin
had said it. So had _his ._players.
They were sky high. - ’ '

Temple was a .

13-yard pass to Williams, the
Bulldogs were breathing down the
Panthers’ throats with a fourth and
one at the four. I

But luck was with the Cats when
Ray Goff fumbled a snap that was
picked up by the Panther nose
guard,Al Romano.

Taking over on his own six, Robert
Haygood took the cautious route.
Deciding not to use the veer so
close to the goal and risk a miscue,
Haygood ran straight at the

“Junkyard Dog” defense, getting,

one yard on three attempts. Swider_
came in, punting to the Pitt 42, and
Georgia again had the ball.

This time it was the Panther
defense that stiffened, catching

, Goff for a nine-yard loss to bring on

field-goal kicker Allan Leavitt, one
of the best hooters in the southeast
Conference. _
Fifty-four yards is one long kick
for any placekicker as Leavitt soon
found out. His kick fell short and
Pitt took over on the 20. r

 ‘Haygood went to the air on the
‘next series and threw a perfect

strike. Unfortunately, the receiver
was ‘Ben Zambiasi, G'eorgia’s
weak-side linebacker, who scam-
pered to the Pitt 25. _. -

Kevin McLee, a "native of
Uniontown, became the next horse
for the Bulldogs as he picked up

- fouf, five, and four yards, again ‘
‘pbefore gaining the final six feetthat
made the score George 6, Pitt 0.

Leavittcame in for the chip shot
and Pitt was trailing 7-0 as the
band played “Dixie.”

With 1:04 left in the ﬁrst half, the
veer ﬁnally began to -move when

Elliott Walker picked‘ up 16 to the ,

/

There was a controversial play
that _tumed the game around. It
came in the third period ‘ with
Temple behind 18-13. Two State
defenders appeared to clobber

Temple ﬂanker Pete Righi on an ,

attempted catch at the Lions’ five.
Ther was no flag. '

“The official was right on topof
the play,” said Hardin. “And his
decision counts.”

. Temple had to settle for a ,
37-yard ﬁeld goal by Don Bitterl-

ich, closing the gap to_ 18-16.
It was a whale of a football game
from thestart. On the first play

. from scrimmage--the crowd of

57,112 was still filing in--Temple’s
Bob Harris ran a simple draw 76
yards for a touchdown.
converted and it was 7-0.

Temple still led at halftime 13-12
as Bitterlich kicked‘
goals’--19 and 40 yards--and State
picked up a pair from Chris Bahr,

25 and 55 yards, plus a 100-yard.

Pitt 42, Dorsett ﬁve, and then
Walker 19 to the Georgia 30.

Keeping on the ground, Haygood
moved to the 13, where the
referees helped the Cats, at least
according to the partisan crowd.

Moving out of the veer, Haygood
seemingly pitched late to Walker,
causing him to fumble. However,
the ref ruled it had been an
incomplete forward pass and the
Panthers kept the ball.

Given new life, ‘Dorsett got four
for the ﬁrst down-‘and things looked
good for the “Burgh’s Boys.”

With a fourth and two at the two,

TD took another pitch but was met
by a large group of red shirts that
stopped the drive, the only one
either team mounted for the rest of

' the half.

Panthers in the second half. From '

the opening kickoff to the final
second, it was a changed’ team from
the one that had wandered‘ into the
locker room trailing 7-0. ~ .
Big breaks also began-falling for
the Cats. After a Larry Swider
punt, deep man Butch Box fumbled
the ball to Bob Jury. It was his ﬁrst
fumble recovery of the day.
' Pitt got from the Bulldog 27 to its
own 19 before Carson Long came in’
and calmly booted a 37-yard ﬁeld

goal that put Pitt on the board for 

the ﬁrst time. ,
Jury couldn’t pull himself away

from the ball, for on the next series ' A

Bitterlich drilled his 37-yarder and

it was 18-16 as they started the

ﬁnal period.

‘Temple ‘tinned 77 vards on 12
plays with freshman Anthony
Anderson smashing the final six

Watson Defeats Nicklaus,
Wins ‘Golf World Series

BY BOB GREEN
AP Golf Writer

AKRON. Ohio--British Open
champion Tom Watson held off
frustrated Jack Nicklaus with a
solid one-over-par 71 and scored a
relatively easy two-stroke victory
Sunday in the last World Series of
Golf to be played under ‘ its
exclusive, four-man format.

The red-haired, freckle’-faced
Watson, rapidly moving into the
front rank of the game’s premier
players, won the $50,000 first ‘prize
with a two-round total of 140,
matching par on the demanding,
7,180-yard Firestone Country Club
course. _

Nicklaus, who won the Masters
then acquired the PGA title on this
course just a month ago, never got
closer than two“ strokes in the mild,

._ _ ._ ____ ck

sunny weather and had to settle
for second with a 70 and a 142
total. Nicklaus, a four-time winner
of this event that brings. together
only the holders of the world's
major titles, now has been
runnerup six times.

US Open titleholder Lou Graham"

and weary Tom Weiskopf, the
Canadian national champion,

didn't get in the title chase,
Weiskopf had a second-round 70
for a 145 and Graham shot 71-147.

Nicklaus, who simply couldn’t
make anything happen--until the
last two -holes, when it was too
late--picked up $15,000 for second,
pushing his career earnings at this
course to an incredible $394,930.
Weiskopf won $7,500 for third
place and the last place Graham

won $5,000.

With the match tied at three
games apiece in the third set,
Orantes achieved a double break-
point, then drove a passing shot
past Connors to grab a 4-3 lead.

Orantes held his service to make

it 5-3, winning the game by picking
off an attempted passing shot
by Connors. With the title within
his reach, Orantes remained steady
while Connors was struggling
noticeably.

At 15-15 in the ninth game,
Connors hit an easy volley into the
net. Then, after a wide shot by

Orantes, Connors hit deep to give
the first of two match points to
Orantes.

Orantes could have put away
Connors on the next point, but a
hard backhand snapped against the
net. much to the relief _of his
out-of-position opponent. But
Connors bit long to set up match

point number two for Orantes, who
knocked another passing shot past
_Connors and gained the crown.
‘Orantes had taken a 2-0 lead in
