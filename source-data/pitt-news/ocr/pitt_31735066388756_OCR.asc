Black history month,

Pete Fleming
Staff Writer

”Learning Our Past To Better
Our Future” is the theme for
Black History Month, which be-
gins on Monday, Feb. 1.

Events scheduled by the Black
Action Society and the Pitt Pro-
gram Council are intended to
raise consciousness and make
people more aware of black
history.

The BAS also stresses that these
events are not just for black peo-

ple, and everyone can benefit

from attending.

On Feb. 11, Dr. Charles King
is conducting a lecture entitled
”How Racist Are You?” He will
focus on attitudes toward all
minorities and question whether
you may have racist thoughts.

Another issue Black History
Month is focused on is the affir-
mation of positive attributes that
blacks have to offer.

”People never really see any-
thing positive about blacks. The
media usually centers on a bad

opinion. We want to focus on the

positive attributes, and we want

February, is just around corner  

, students to understand black cul-

ture. We don't want them to learn
from [second-hand] experience

' ~ which is the news -— but rather

[by first-hand] experience
[through] Black History
Month,” said Monique Sims,
chairperson ofthe BAS. '

Sims also wanted to express to
black people that the BAS wants
to help them develop a positive
self—concept. They want to boost
people's self—images.

The program also includes the
production ”From Billy to Lena
with Jenifer,” which is sponsored

Nuns dissent on abortion policy

-By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

The Catholic Church, respond-
ing to the dissenting opinion ex-
pressed by Sisters Barbara Ferraro
and Patricia Hussey, is investigat-
ing the position the two nuns
have taken that are contrary to
the church's position on abortion.

The two nuns, of the Sisters of
Notre Dame de Namur, were in-
volved in an incident Saturday,
Jan. 23, in which a program spon-
sored by the National Abortion
Rights Action League honoring
the two was moved from the
Temple Rodef Shalom to the
Friends Meeting House to avoid
a strain in relations between the
Jewish and Catholic faiths.

Rodef Shalom clarified that it
was not attempting to make any
sort of statement in conflict with
the Catholic Church; rather, it

 .wa..s, s.innp|.y allowing a group to

utilize their facilities. However,
when it appeared the reason the
site was chosen was religiously
motivated, the Temple felt it was
best if it declined from hosting
the group.

Diocese spokesman Reverend
Ron Lengwin said, ”We have al-
ways held [the Temple’s] Rabbi
Walter Jacob [in] the highest
regard  no, we are not upset but
indeed grateful that they [Rodef
Shalom] were sensitive as they al-
ways are.”

Concerning the sisters, he said,
”Their own religious order is in
the process of investigation,” and
”ulimately the possibility exists
that they may be expelled from
their order.” -

NARAL Pittsburgh Director
Janet Catov said, ”We were for-
tunate that we could find another
site.” She said that with all of the

attention surrounding the protests 

and religious implications, it was
unfortunate that ”it was kind of
lost what these two women were
brought to town to say.”

”The nuns spoke about the de-
velopment of their own choice [at
the meeting], how they came to
question certain ideas, and their
own experience as nuns, and
nuns with a dissenting opinion,”
said Catov.

A spokeswoman for the two
sisters from the organization
Catholics for a Free Choice said
the nuns have received word
from the Sisters of Notre Dame
ordering them to ”refrain from
making public statements which
do not fully convey their position
so that the possibility of such
statements being interpreted as
pro—abortion will be minimized.”

The two sisters have released a
statement: ”We are deeply sad-
dened that the leadership has is

by the PPC. The show stars Jenifer
Lewis, who‘ has performed in
many broadway productions, in-
cluding Dreamgirls.

”The Black History Month has
a lot to offer everyone. Everyone
should participate in at least one
activity,” said Sims.

Month are as follows:

0 Feb. 1 —”From Billy to Lena
with Jenifer,” at 8:30 p.m.

0 Feb. 6 -— ’’Still I Rise,” by the

Reagan softens on
contra aid position

By Jim Drinkard

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Presi-
dent Reagan pledged Wednes-
day to consult personally with
the presidents of Central
American democracies before
approving arms and ammuni-
tion for Nicaraguan rebels as
part of a $36.2 million aid
package he is requesting.

Appearing before the
Reserve Officers Association
to press for renewal of U.S. as-
sistance to the Contra rebels
battling Nicaragua's Marxist-
led Sandinista government,
Reagan said, ’’I did not come
to Washington to preside over

the communization of Central

America.”

Reagan's speech coincided
with the submission to Con-
gress of his request for the aid
package, which includes $3.6
million for replenishment of
stocks of ammunition and
shoulder—fired antiaircraft
missiles.

The rest would be for logisti-
cal and other supplies classi-
fied by the administration as
non-lethal.

The lethal portion would be
held in abeyance until March
31 and not released unless the
president certified that ”the
steps taken by the Sandinistas
were irreversible steps to
democracy in Nicaragua,” the

Newspapers say Israeli soldiers abusing Arabs

JERUSALEM — Israel
newspaper reports Wednesday
challenged officially stated poli-
cy that soldiers only beat Arab
protesters in the act of rioting or
resisting arrest.

The daily tabloid Hadashot, the
liberal Haaretz newspaper and
the English language Jerusalem
Post published reports claiming
Arabs were beaten in-

discriminately or after being

taken into custody.

Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who visited a blood-
fstained wall in the occupied West
Bank where soldiers allegedly
beat prisoners, vowed Tuesday to
‘investigate any wrongful beatings
of Arabs. ’

”There is no policy of punish-
ing by beatings,” Rabin said. But
in an interview with Israel army
radio after the visit, he conceded
”there were exceptions” and vio-

lations were being investigated.

-Eyewitnesses cited by the
/erusalem Post said soldiers had
regularly beaten detainees at the
wall, located near Manara Square
in the West Bank town of
Ramallah. ‘

 

Menachem Shizaf, a cor-
respondent for the Hadashot
newspaper, quoted an_ unidenti-

_fied 20-year-old soldier from the

Gaza Strip as saying he was given
orders to beat young Arabs in
door-to-door sweeps through
refugee camps. He said the poli-
cy was causing division among
soldiers.

Wednesday, for the second day
in a row, the level of incidents ap-
peared to be escalating after a
period of relative calm.

A CBS crew was beaten by
soldiers in Gaza, CBS bureau
chief Terry Plantinga said. The
army said it was looking into the
report but had not yet received an
official complaint.

In the Arab neighborhood of
Anata on the northern outskirts of
Jerusalem, a squad of police and
three border policemen armed
with M-16 assault rifles and clubs
fired tear gas canisters and rubber
bullets into a crowd of about 100
demonstrating youths.

conducted a six-year investiga-
tion of hundreds of people and
organizations opposed to the
Reagan administration's policies
in Central America, a New York-
based lawyers’ group said Wed-
nesday.

The Center for Constitutional
Rights released about 50 pages of
the 1,200 pages of FBI files it col-
lected under the Freedom of In-
formation Act.

Center attorney Margaret Rat-
ner said the documents, many of
which were partially blacked out
before being turned over to the
group, showed that the FBI used
wiretaps, undercover agents and
informants to gather information
on the Committee in Solidarity
with the People of El Salvador.

Ann Mari Buitrago, director of
F.O.I.A. Inc., who analyzed the
documents, described the FBI in-
vestigation as ”an old-fashioned
domestic security investigation

She was referring to revelations
following the death of J. Edgar
Hoover that the agency, under
his directorship, had been in-
volved in the surveillance of U.S.
political and religious leaders in
the 1960s and early 1970s.

Ray McE|haney, an FBI public
information officer in Washing-
ton, told the Boston Globe,
which first reported the study,
that he could not comment on
specifics of the investigation be-
cause the material is classified
and two suits are pending.

Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and con-
stitutional rights, said, ”This in-
vestigation has an odor of
harassment about it.

”We want the FBI to investigate
when there is criminal or terrorist
conduct.'When there is not, the
investigation must stop,” he said.
”The FBI is supposed to catch
criminals, not political activists.”

Woman wants to move to Same town as her lover

ship. I have been in love with this
fellow for several months. We
met when he was visiting my
town, and he came in to buy
something where I work. We had
a terrific fling, and we have kept
in touch ever since, mostly by
phone. He has been here three
times, and it is always great when
we are together, but this is as far

mean I want to date, but now I
don't even have that as a pastime
and for company.

A: This sounds funny to me,
but l am not laughing. My bet is
that he doesn't want you in his
town because he is married or
has another woman there, at
least. What is this, that you
couldn't get an apartment there?
I know there are housing short-
ages, I know there are high-rent
areas, but if a man wants you to
come live with him, he can find
the place.

It is one thing ifa man and wife
have to be separated a lot —- like
a husband and wife in the mili-
tary, for instance, or when the
husband is on the road. Then the
wife at home doesn't date for
company and something to pass
the time —— she has women
friends, club or church or syna-
gogue activities, volunteer work.

And she anticipates those
homecomings of her husband,
and makes the most of them.

But for you, I think you have to
go back to dating and find
another steady man who does not
have to be apart from you, who
doesn't use such a pallid excuse
to keep you in one town and him
in another. Or, if he is now sepa-
rated from you for realistic rea-
sons or can form plans and show
intentions of being with you per-
manently in the near future, by
some forseeable date.

Q: I need to know if it is nor-
mal for a teenage boy to have a
sexual encounter. The reason is
that the boy I am going with likes
me, and I think he is attractive,
but my friends say he is not a boy
for a girl to take seriously because
he has been involved with a gay
guy and is probably gay himself.

But I hear so much about be-
ing uncertain of one’s sexual
identity and about young boys
and girls having homosexual ex-
periences and growing past that
stage. This guy is known to have
had several one-night stands with
girls, but not with me yet. And he

told a friend of mine that he is not
sure that he isn't basically gay. 50
I am wondering ifl should get
into this relationship any more
deeply.
A: If you told me that he once
had a homosexual encounter but
is definitely not gay in his sexual
preferences, I would say not to
worry too much, give this rela-
tionship a chance if you like him
that much and he likes you. But
when he has stated that he
doesn't know which way is his
way, then it seems that he may be
conflicted, and there is nothing
you can do about that. There is
no point for you in getting in-
volved with someone who is sex-
ually conflicted -— neither for him
or for you. .
it is true that a juvenile
homosexual experience or two is
often just part of growing up, and
young people who remember
these occurrences and begin to
worry are usually just told to for-
get it, not to think that one such
event reveals their true nature or
leaves an indelible sexual mark.
When a late adolescent says he
or she is strongly attracted one
way or the other, that is another
matter; the young person of
strong homosexual tendencies
will not ”just forget” them, no
matter who advises it, and will
persist in homosexual behavior
and often in seeking knowledge
and aid with his or her life.

pression of Blacks in South Afri-

the continued imprisonment of
Nelson Mandela. Yet, minorities
in the United States enjoy an in-

privileges. One such privilege is
the ability of Blacks to obtain
higher education at schoolslike
the University of Pittsburgh. But
IS JUST BEING HERE ENOUGH?
Are we maximizing the returns
from the sweat of the 60’s? Are
we achieving at the highest pos-

important for Black college stu-
dents to do so?

Talented people are one of our
nation's finest resources. They
possess the power to make
change, to create unlimited op-
portunities for themselves and
others, and to fuel the necessary
cycle of progress. And, it's no
secret that many of these talent-
ed individuals are the products of
colleges and universities across
the country. The leaders of this
nation are usually, and not supris—

Archaeologist discovers birthplace of St. Peter

By Paul Hirschhorn

Associated Press Writer

ET TELL, Israeli-Annexed Golan
Heights —- Archaeologists say
they have settled a centuries-old
debate over the location of Beth-
saida, a fishing village where the
apostle Peter was born and where
Jesus was said to have worked
miracles.

”There is no doubt now that

 this is Bethsaida,” said archaeol-

ogist Rami Arav, who headed the
excavation of the site last April.

A complete kitchen from the
time ofJesus with many of its ves-

sels intact plus boxes of pottery
have been unearthed at Et Tell,
one of two sites long believed by
scholars to be the biblical city.

Arav said in an interview that
the_second site, pinpointed by
biblical experts in the mid-19th
century, was a nearby ruin called
El—Araj, on the shores of the Sea
of Galilee.

"To end the debate once and «

for all, we conducted test digs at
the two sites to see if we could
find a layer from the time when
Jesus lived. The shafts yielded the
layer we sought only at Et Tell,”
Arav said.

Rocky terrain and clashes that
culminated in Israel seizing the
Golan Heights from Syria in 1967
have long made theories about
the location of Bethsaida hard to
prove.

Even today, access is difficult.
Et Tell, a small ‘mound just north
of where the Jordan River emp-
ties into the Sea of Galilee, is situ-
ated among abandoned Syrian
bunkers and exploded 52mm
mortar shells in an area that until
recently was suspected of being
a minefield.

Bethsaida was the site where
Jesus was said to have restored a

blind man’s sight (Mark 8:22) and
healed Peter’s mother of a fever
(Matthew 8:14).

He also began his famous walk
on water from the shores of Beth-
saida (Mark 6:45), and chose a
site nearby to multiply two llSl’l
and five loaves of bread into
enough food to feed 5,000 fol-
lowers (Luke 9:10).

Bethsaida, which means house
of fishing in Aramaic, the lan-
guage Jesus spoke, was also the
birthplace of Peter, his brother
Andrew and the apostle Phillip
(John 1:44).

”Bethsaida was extremely im-

portant,” said Arav, of the Golan
Research Institute in Katzrin,
eight miles north of Et Tell.

”It is the third—most frequently
mentioned place in the New
Testament, cited in the Gospels
of Matthew, Mark, Luke and
John. Only Jerusalem and Caper-
naum , are mentioned Inore
often,” he said.

Because it was also a popular
spot of early Christian pilgrim-
mage, scholars were able to esti-
mate its position as early as 1860,
said the Rev. Virgil Pixner, a Ro-
man Catholic priest and an expert
on early Christian culture.

do talented Blacks fit into all of
this? Not quite as easily, not as
frequently as we would like. It
frightens my colleagues and me
that the level of achievement wi-

‘thin the Black population of this

University is not equal to that of
the population as a whole. We
realize that if Blacks demonstrate
a trend of academic indifference
at the college level, then we will
inevitably flounder when we are
hurled into the shark filled waters
of those accustomed to
achievement. ,

The ongoing civil rights strug-
gle is worthless if the members
for whom it is being fought are
not attaining at the highest possi-
ble levels. What benefit is it to be
able to sit in any restaurant we
would like, and not be able to af-
ford the food? If we waste our
mental potential, then we not
only squander our national

‘ t resources, but we find ourselves

wondering why our economic
state is so low.
What is it that is keeping us
from obtaining the greatest pos-
sible education for our time and
money? To be sure, there are ex-
ternal negative forces. However,
where is the drive taht en-
courages us to challenge our-
selves, and to reach beyond any
personal eduacational limits that
we believe exist for us? Have we
as a race become too comforta-
ble existing under the heavy
blanket of stagnancy: content
with the ”norms” that society has
set for us in terms of education
and success? Should we accept
the term ”Exceptiona| Black Man
..or Woman” instead of ”Excep—
ltional Man or Woman who is
also Black”? some of the
problems lie with us, and it's up

institution. What effect will a
despairing lack of success have
on it? The health of a university
is, in large part, related to the
mental fitness of its student body.
How can a body be healthy if
some vital organ is faltering? If a
large portion of students (name-
ly Black students) decided to in-
crease their efforts to succeed,
then only positive effects will be
realized by the University as a
whole, and by those high achiev-
ing individuals.

When considering the severity
of the major standing issue, the
lack of enthusiasm for achieving
academic excellence, it becomes
clear why it is so necessary to
work towards eliminating this
problem. Making our marks aca-
demically can lead to new oppor-
tunities for the acquisition of
power. With this power, we can

Television blackout

The Pitt Panthers are currently ranked among the elite
basketball teams in the country. Unfortunately, the peo-
ple who run the university's athletic department are not
of the same excellent caliber of Paul Evans’ team.

It seems the Pitt athletic administration has a novel idea
that goes against a precedent set years ago when televi-
sion became synonymous with sports.

Pitt blacked out Monday night's home game against»

Providence on ESPN. Pitt made a similar decision last Feb.
9' when the Pitt-Syracuse game at the Civic Arena was
blacked out within a 35—mile radius of the game site. Both
games were sold—out.

It usually works the other way. A home team has to sell
out a televised game to prevent the blackout in the im-
mediate area of that team's location.

We take it that Dr. Edward E. Bozik, Pitt's athletic direc-

. tor, and W. Dean Billick, Pitt's associate athletic director,
see themselves as trendsetters.
P They don't even try to hide the fact that Pitt fans who
can't purchase tickets, and students who are in the same
position, aren't important to them. Money is the bottom
line at Pitt. There's no doubt financial gain is one of, if
not the most important aspect of a major college's athlet-
ic department.

But we can't understand what chances Pitt is taking by
lifting blackouts of sold-out home games.

Bozik and Billick say they owe it to the fans who pur-
chase tickets and brave the elements of a cold Pittsburgh
winter night to watch the Panthers play.

Our guess is that Bozik and Billick think they'll lose sea-
son ticket-holders and, consequently, money if they lift
blackouts. But that doesn't seem to make sense because
most Pitt ticket-holders who sit in the blue-backed seats

' now have to make contributions to the Golden Panthers

of at least $250 for each seat per year, not including-the
price of the ticket. This action was due to the demand for
Pitt basketball tickets. A demand which has skyrocketed
in the last three years. ‘

. We think Bozik and Billick must not understand how
far Pitt's program has come. And how much bigger it will
get.

it's tragic that Pitt's top two athletic administrators don't
have nearly as much ability in their field as guys like Jer-
ome Lane and Charles Smith do in theirs.

‘—

English only — a good idea 

The Pittsburgh Ethnic Coalition
has banded together with the
American Jewish Conference and
several other groups to oppose a
bill presently before the General
Assembly of Pennsylvania.

House Bill No. 77 proposes to
make the English language the
official language of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania. Under
this bill, English would be‘ the
only language in which official
documents would be printed.

The PEC and the AJC oppose
this particular piece of legislation
because they ‘ claim it will be
”divisive, anti-immigrant and dis-
criminatory.” Fortunately for
these groups, it will be none of
these things.

Apparently, the PEC and the
AJC are afraid that this will divide
American people into two groups
-— those who read, write and
speak English and those who do
not. This condition, however, al-
ready exists. Not passing this bill
will only serve to maintain the di-
vision between those who can
use English and those who
cannot

By not passing this bill, we are
essentially saying that you don't
have to learn English if you don't
want to because we will accomo-
date your needs. How anyone
can expect the majority of Ameri-
cans to cater to a handful of in-
dividuals is beyond reasoning. By
not legislating English as the offi-
cial language, we are only ex-
cluding those people who cannot
use English from everyday activi-
ties by allowing them not to learn
it. '

This bill’ is also not anti-
immigrant. By making English the
official language, we are ensuring

  

lI.IAM
vouue

that all immigrants to the United
States (or, in this case, Pennsyl-
vania) must learn the English lan-
guage. lmmigrants would be
assimilated much more quickly
and become part of the American
system much faster if they
couldn't depend on their native
language to get by.

Whom this bill would dis-
criminate against is something I
haven't yet figured out. To as-
sume that an American would
discriminate against someone
who couldn't use English would
be to assume most Americans are
xenophobes

The A}C believes that this isin
some way a racist bill. Colorado
State Attorney General Duane
Woodard spoke to a chapter of
the AJC and said that ”the world
looked the other way when Hit-
ler pushed his ideas of racial and
ethnic purity  and we now
know what a small step can make
toward savagery."

This is some pretty heavy-
handed rhetoric against a bill that

only wants to institutionalize En-
glish. Anyone who can equate
Hitler with a movement to make
English the official language
either doesn’t know anything
about Hitler or knows very little
about the widespread use of En-
glish in America.

Another reason groups like the
AJC and the PEC oppose this bill
is because they are afraid that eth-
nic groups will somehow lose
their identity. Just because En-
glish would be the offical lan-
guage doesn’t mean that people
wouldn't be allowed to study

other languages or practice them 

or print foreign language
newspapers for their own ethnic
communities. It would mean that
if you wanted to live in America,
you would have to be able to use
English.

tor for The Pitt News.

In a nutshell 

The administration
just has what amounts
now to an ideological
obsession with over-

throwing that
government.

Riding shotgun for families

PORTSMOUTH, N.H. —- The
Great American Family Tour be-
gan, appropriately enough, with
a mild case of carsickness. This
is the staple of every family trip,
sort of like ”99 bottles of beer on
the wall.”

But soon Gary Goldberg, the
engaging if slightly queasy execu-
tive producer of Family Ties, was
recovering with the aid of seltzer
water. Nearby were the other
members of this road show. They
included, in alliterative order, a
pediatrician, a Ph.D. and a poli-
tician, as well as a producer and
a purpose: to get family issues
into the presidential campaign.

”The-people of New Hamp-
shire have a proxy for the rest of
us,” the politician, Rep. Pat
Schroeder, told the audience.
”We’ve got to get these issues
front and center.” This is why
Schroeder, who left the presiden-
tial trail herself, returned to
primary county at the head of this
issues troupe. First stop «Ports-
mouth, then south for Super
Tuesday.

The pediatrician who signed on
for the duration is the cherubic
superstar of the infant world, Dr.
T. Berry Brazelton. He will up-
hold the campaign tradition of
baby—coddling.

The Ph.D. is Diana Meehan of
the University. of Southern
California. Meehan, with her hus-
band, Gary Goldberg, ran a day-
care center in Berkley in 1971
called ”The Organic Day Care
Center.” It operated under the
thoroughly Berkley motto: ”Rain
or shine, we take your kids on a
trip every day.” In the more en-
trepreneurial '80s, Goldberg not
only wrangled a day-care center
out of Paramount Studios, he is
basing his new TV show in a fic-
tional center. I

The tour’s Sunday opening
drew a crowd of some 600 peo-
ple despite heavy competition
from the NFL playoffs and the
warm weather. They were osten-
sibly to celebrate the 20th an-

niversary of the Community Day‘

Care Center. But they were also
_there to lament the waiting list
that this and every other decent
center carries as its testament to
the enormous need.

”All of you here get to see
more of the candidates than you

‘probably want to,” said Shroed-
er. ”Ask them about their family
policy. And if they start to tell you
about their grandparents and
their parents, say that's not what
you meant.” Hold them, she
urged, to specifics: issues such as
parental leave, child care and
health care.

In fairness, words like ”family”
and ”child care" do pop up more
often this presidential season than
before. There is hardly a candi-
date who doesn’t insert at least
one reference to day care.
Among the Democrats, Bruce
Babbitt and toa lesser degree
Mike Dukakis have made day
care central. Among the Repub-

licans, Robert Dole has done
more than tip his hat in that
direction.

In every poll and focus group,
concern about children and anxi-
ety about family life come up.
But, as Shroeder suggested; day
care has nowhere near as high a
political profile as, say, social
security.

It may be that children are still
seen as our private property and

problem. It may be that young —

parents are too loaded down to
get involved in politics. It may be
that children don't vote. But we
have yet to empower parents to
see themselves as a legitimate
constituency with real clout.

Family issues, as Brazelton put
it most eloquently and perhaps
most politically, aren't only about
children. ’’I’m just as concerned
about the adult as the child,’’ said
the man who has spent his life
watching the interaction of new-
borns and new parents. It's made
him an ardent supporter of paren-
tal leave.

Now he asks: ”How are we go-
ing to back up families under
stress?” Pressures on young fami-
lies -— the two—worker economy,
the hovering presence of divorce,
feelings of isolation and failure a
are not just affecting children.
They are ”cutting adult develop-
ment at a crucial stage.”

Parents may indeed have as
much at stake, and as much in
common, this year as any mem-
bers of a senior citizens group.
What they lack is a political sense
of self. The candidates, in turn,
from right to left, pay lip service
to their concerns, but don't wor-
ry about them as a voting bloc.

When ideology meets reality

MATTHEW
THORNTON

Next week, a new Contra aid
package will be voted upon in
Congress. In the request for $36

 

million in aid, both humanitari-
an and military, for the
Nicaraguan Contras, there is a

‘ provision that the funds slated for

military use be placed in escrow
pending a cease-fire agreement.

Thirty—six million is a far cry
from the original $270 million
Reagan planned to request,
which is probably a good indica-
tion of the opposition the
proposal will meet in Congress.

Should the escrow option be
approved by the Congress, the
administration would have the
right to decide whether the peace
negotiations had stalled. Mem-
bers of the administration have
said that an involvement of the
Congress in the release of the
money would violate the separa-
tion of powers set forth in the

If the‘Reagan camp is willing to
wait for a resolution of the current
negotiations before sending mu-
nitions to the Contras, I have to
wonder why it is important to in-
clude that aid in the current pack-
age. Should the talks between the
Sandinistas and the Contras prove
unsuccessful, and the administra-
tion still sees a need for military
aid, itcould pursue such aid at
that time. For the present, though,
the negotiations should be al-
lowed to proceed without the
confirmed threat of continued
American military aid. 

Quite possibly, the White
House affiliates feel that a delay
of the funding request, or a se-
cond funding request later in the
year, would decrease its chances
of procuring that aid. The Ameri-
can public, aleady becoming dis-
enchanted with the prospect of
continued Contra funding, may
not be as receptive later in the
year to further military aid.

In his State of the Union ad-
dress, President Reagan told Con-

gress that hewanted to develop »

a better working relationship with
them for his last year in office.
Maybe, in the interest of forging

- that relationship, the president’

should wait until his requests for
military aid don't need to be sup-
ported by conciliatory
disclaimers.

Rather refuses to

beat around Bush  

It seems like employees of
the news business are just as
much the news as the ”real
news" they report lately. Or
rather, Dan Rather is.

Some people seem to think
he's a pretty hot (around the
collar) item when it comes to
interviewing. But that may be
good, if he's looking to make
a name for himself as one of
the most controversial
newspersons around, for, as
he said,  more attention is
sometimes given to the heat
than the light ...” -

FRANCES
The amplified loquacity of 
White House correspondent

Sam Donaldson is ill—received  
among the ranks of D.C. politicians, yet, even Donaldson will
tell you: ”Rather went too far.” He also remarked, ”He [Rather]_
had a legitimate reason to try to press Bush. But in the give-
and—take of these things, I don't think we can get to a situation
where we make — on our own authority —— accusations.”
With that statement, Donaldson has sharply focused on a very,
very elite pool of near—corruption that exists within the hierar-
chy of the corporate news structure. When one weighs the an-
chor, it's quite easy to deduce that only those whose footprints
leave the deepest impression are allowed to go overboard.
The nightly news anchor is, and has been for a long time,
a sacred American institution. They are among the most lucra-
tively paid in their business and forge a great impact on their

  

viewers, the American public. With this very real, tappable pow— F

er, it is an acceptable notion that an attitude of ”above the news”
(i.e. ”above the law”) propels them to press for answers to ques-
tions in a less—than—acceptable manner. And the word ”accept—
able” in the news business denotes a great deal more leeway
than an afternoon tea and croissant party with Miss Manners.
Yes, we do want to know the extent of presidential candidate
George Bush’s involvement in the Contra dealings. Americans
want to be privy to such. We want Dan Rather to help us find
out as much about George Bush as George Bush doesn’t want

us to know. Welike tough, inquisitive interviews. We like to 

see people being put on the spot.
Remember when the testy Rather walked off theset when

a tennis match went overtime? If that is any indication to the ,

position he places himself in (which it most certainly is), then
he has clearly become out offhand.

While it is inevitable that the media (in this case, Rather) is
always going to be the message, it is about time the message
learn to curb its temper. It would be impossible for those who
report the news‘ to never make the news —- this serves as one
mere incident of that.

From Ed Murrow, who laid out the blueprint for the A”news—
man,” to Linda Ellerbee and her creaming of the ”twinkie,” me-
dia personnel have actively participated in their craft and have
carved out their own place in media history. Often times, report-
ers are simply a lot more interesting than politicians and Wall
Street whizzes because of the position they are in and the iro-
ny involved in this sort of se|f—scanda|ization.

It is difficult to predict at present the direction the news in-
dustry is headed. It is ever-evolving. When people like Rather_
are responsible for shaping its future, the possible outcome is
disconcerting.

As a certain song once said, People love it when you lose,
they love dirty laundry. Well, according to the papers, Mr.
Rather, you lost, 1-0.

On the importance

of good headlines

I noticed, with some dismay, a
front-page article on your edition
of Jan. 21, 1988, entitled
”Supreme Court Upholds CMU
Suit.”

The headline caught myeye
because I am the attorney for Wil-
liam Boyle, the plaintiff in a
wrongful discharge from CMU
that, as noted in the article, went
to the United States Supreme
Court for decision on a
procedural issue.

While the text of the story is

correct, the headline is mislead-
ing in that one would think that
the position of Carnegie Mellon
University, the defendant in this

suit and the petitioner before the
Supreme Court, was upheld- On
the contrary, the position of Car-
negie Mellon University was not
accepted by the Supreme Court,

but the position of my client re-”

questing the affirmation to Feder-
al District Court was accepted.
As a reader of The Pitt News for
some time, attending both under-
graduate and law school at Pitt,
I make this observation so that
headlines, which are sometimes
the only part of the newspaper
read by some people, correctly
indicate the text that [will] follow._

Chill Factor International plays a positive ridd°

By Joel Timulak

Assistant Showcase Editor

"Reggae music is roots music.
It is about truth and right, a mes-
sage to all the people of the world

. and it’s growing,” said Peter
”Curly” Richards, Chill Factor in-
ternational’s bassist. Curly is a na-
tive Jamaican and veteran of the
its club scene. ”Reggae music,”
he elaborated, ”is most spiritual
and positive.” Sitting on the
couch in the band's Squirrel Hill
practice room, Curly talks about
reggae not in comparison to other
music but to ”the evil system in
the world.”

Mike Jones, the group's smooth
vocalist and founder, agreed.
Mike fell in love with reggae at
a Peter Tosh concert four years
ago. ”You are enticed by reggae’s
sweet danceability, then you start
to understand the words and
they’re good, they're positive and
somewhat political, different than
DJ music lyrics which are
silly.” J '

Chill Factor International was
formed about a year and a half
ago when Mike, inspired by the
Swammp Band, another local
reggae band, put an ad the paper.

Herman Pearl, a versatile
guitarist, answered the ad and
convinced his brother, Andy, to
play drums. The two both attend-
ed Pittsburgh High School for
Creative and Performing Arts and
are familiar with a variety of
musics.

Chill Factor’s original bassist
was found to be somewhat in-
compatible with the other mem-
bers and, subsequently, Mike
Jones ran another ad. Curly’s
mother read the ad and en-
couraged her son to give him a
call. Curly had been living in
America for less than two years
and Chill Factor International is
his first American band.

The four got along well and
considered themselves perma-
nent members. ”There are cool
vibes among the band,” insisted
Curly to which Andy jokingly ad-
ded, ”no sibling rivalries.”

Two months ago, in an attempt
to create a fuller sound with more
variety, the band added key-
boardist Brad Hunter. A talented
player and arranger, Brad also
shares the group's liking for the
reggae message: ”Truth, life, har-
mony between people; if.l’m go-
ing to play music, l think that

message must come across.”

Chill Factor International has
been delivering their message to
all of Pittsburgh’s bars and univer-
sities steadily since August of
1987. At present, they play regu-
larly at O’Rourke’s in Squirrel
Hill and have begun to appear
before audiences in West Virginia
and Ohio. They have recently
supported international artists
Mutabaruka, Barrington Levi and
Bad Brains.

On stage, all members sing and
occasionally switch instruments.
Their versatility as musicians is
focused on their original songs
and arrangements for covers.
They want to represent a wide
variety of styles and introduce
people to new music. The band
plays roots (as did Bob Marley
and Peter Tosh) as well as dub,
dance hall, DJ-style, calypso,
soca and ska, however their origi-
nals ”focus our individual crea-
tive powers,” added Mike Jones.

Chill Factor lnternational is
pleased with their local following
which, they said is half black and
half white. Herman elaborates,

Growing up with Huck Finn
in the Tony winner Big River

By Cathleen Karlsson
Staff Writer

If you have ever wondered
what it would have been like to
live in the 1840s along the Mis-
sissippi River, watching the
steamboats float past carrying
passengers back and forth from
North to South, now is your
chance. The musical Big River:
The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn allows you to do just that.

Playing this week at Heinz
Hall, the production is filled with
action. Stressing the conflict be-
tween whites and their slaves
during that era, the musical hits
upon some touching and per-
sonal scenes which involve the
audience in the performance.

Act I opens with Mark Twain's
famous ”Notice,” which states
that one should not attempt to
pick apart his tale but merely en—
joy it. This request is easy to com-
ply with since each actor of the
show’s company continually re-

, lates back to the audience as

though each member of it is part
of each scene.

Perhaps this is because of the
direct contact the players can
give through close-range acting,
as though the stage is no impedi-
ment separating them from the
audience.

The first scene of the show por-
trays Huck eating at the dinner ta-

ble being talked (sung) down to
by the town members who tell
him that he'll never get to heaven
if he doesn't straighten up and
learn how to get there. This leads
to another interaction the show
has with the audience.

Each scene is narrated by Huck
Finn (Romain Fruge), either in the
form of straightforward story-
telling or interior monologue. By
helping to move the story along
in this fashion — Huck looking
out to the audience, occasional-
ly as though searching for
guidance or approval -- one is
able to maintain a personal rela-
tionship with him.

As Huck grows up through his
adventures, so the audience is
made to feel as though they may
have helped him.

Some of the most moving
scenes are those that take place
along the river as Huck and Jim
(Michael Edward Stevens) en-
counter problems as well as reali-
zations about their relationship.

Jim, although a runaway slave,
acts as a sort of father figure and
friend to Huck. This relationship,
between blacks and whites, was
not generally accepted at that
time and was one of the obstacles
Huck eventually learned to over-
come, no matter what the conse-
quences.

The score, composed by Roger

Miller, includes memorable and
inspirational songs such as ”Wai-
tin’ for the Light to Shine,” ”The
Crossing,” ”River in the Rain,”
”How Blest We Are”‘ and
”Leavin’s Not the Only Way to
Go.”

The blend of Fruge’s and
Stevens voices offer moving and
seasoned performances. The
booming strength of Stevens’,
coupled with Fruge’s lighter emo-
tional voice, seem to show the
constrast between adults and the
innocence of childhood.

Performances were strong,
well-defined and realistic. It was
moving to see Fruge trying to re-
main in character as he wiped
away tears gathered in his eyes
from emotional pieces such as
”Waitin’ for the Light to Shine.”

Another performance which
was outstanding was the scene in
which Stevens sings ”Free At
Last.” This piece was so inspira-
tional that it was difficult to re-
strain from singing along with
him. 

it is no wonder Big River has
received seven Tony Awards,
which included Best Musical of
1985. It is well-deserved and sig-
nifies that the show should not be
missed. Big River: The Adven-
tures of Huckleberry Finn will
continue playing at Heinz Hall
until Jan. 31. .

There seems to be too many
rock groups that sound fantastic
on their records but can't
reproduce their music live. flRE-
HOSE has been the antithesis. To
this point, they've been far more
energetic live than on record.

That is, up until now. Their sec-

they've finally become comfort-

their folk-flavored first album.
The styles range from all out rock-
ers (”Sometimes," ”Honey,
Please" and ”Windmilling”) to a
quiet ballad (”ln Memory of
ElizabethlCotton"). flREHOSE has
even thrown in a couple of
pseudo-rap songs (”Making the
Freeway" and ”Me & You
Remembering”).

If’n also contains two vocal
firsts for flREHOSE. Mike Watt
raps four of the album's 14 songs,
including ”Thunder Child" and
the atmospheric ”Operation
Solitaire.” The second is sung by
Phranc on the beautiful ballad
’’In Memory of Elizabeth
Cotton.”

The best thing about If’n is that
f|REHOSE appears to be more

 

unified. The lyrics are more direct
and more effective than the last
effort. Watt’s lyrics are more bit-
ing and satirical than ever before.
”For the Singer of REM” tears
apart the idea that words are just
words and that sounds should be
put before meaning. Watt’s polit-
ical consciousness comestout a§‘l3.

ing ‘us to watch the watching-
men, watching those in

ics have improved on this outing.
”E'lizabeth Cotton” is a touching
eulogy for the author of ”Freight

With If’n, the members of f|RE-
HOSE have proven themselves
worthy of greater exposure.

Live on the Double Planet

Acoustic guitar — thanks to the
advent of the piezoelectric pick-
up and to improved technology
in the realm of amplification —

has enjoyed a revival; guitarists
are now as likely to use a Wash-
burn electrified acoustic as a
Fender Strat. Many have aban-
doned the electric completely,
playing solely acoustic albums
and venues. Live on the Double
Planet is a an acoustic guitar LP
of this sort. The reasons for

Hedges popular appeal and crit-

Today, there are a lot of places
selling stereo sound including
department, appliance, mass mer-
chandising, and catalogue stores.

Most of these stores have two
things in common. First. they do not
sell expensive state of the art com
ponents so they rarely get to hear
the worlds finest sounds. Second, the
nice people they employ: who also
sell refrigerators, lawn mowers, and
coffee pots, are not the ones from
whom to get the correct advice
about stereo. Their good intentions
are not a substitute for a real
knowledge about sound.

Opus One is the dealer for the
best sounding equipment in the
world. Our staff knows what is impor—
tant for great sound and what is not.

Our $499 stereo system
does not sound like
an appliance

We carefully test and listen to all of
the low cost equipment to find the
few that sound real, like the expen
sive great units.

Not only is Opus One, Penn-
sylvania's oldest [founded in 1959)
stereo store, but our staff has worked
very hard to, gain great knowledge
about sound. Our people have in-
stalled more stereo systems repaired
more components, and recorded
more live concerts than all other Pitts
burgh audio stores put together!

out 8499 system has been

carefully engineered with a Sonus
Red magnetic cartridge, a Nikko
NP550 turntable. a Nikko NR-650 38
watt rms per channel fmom
receiver, and two Boston Acoustics
A—6O loudspeakers. This remarkable

 

system will protect your valuable
recordings and sound much better
than similarly priced chrome plated,
“look—a«like" components oftered for
sale by appliance salesmen, in
those one brand rack systems. The
system price is regularly S670.

Opus One has low cost, great
sounding options such as, CD
players, cassette decks,
stereophones, and audio furniture to
increase this systems flexibility. Ask
our experts for their
recommendations.

Helping to make our 3499 system
a legend in its own time, are many
knowledgeable Pittsburgh
audiophiles who are recommending
it to their friends as the only low cost
system that really sounds good.

guitarist himself plays with facil-
ity and expression on both his
own compositions and on the
very aptly chosen covers. It is pre-
cisely these covers that show best
why Hedges has risen to the top
of Windham Hill's roster as well
as providing a showcase for his
superb chops on steellstring.
While many of his contemporar-
ies are enamored of rather ob-
scure folk or classical music,
Hedges is a fan of modern music
and uses it liberally within his
repertoire. As far as his chops go,

he is eclectic in his chosen tech- ‘

niques and dissatisfied with the
standard, fingerlpicking status
quo. Hedges uses unconvention-
al modal tunings popularized in
the playing of '60s artists such as
Richie Havens in conjunction
with flamenco, tapping, other
percussive techniques and bend-
ing to produce a style having the
warmth of the acoustic and the
power of the electric.

The opening cut is ’’All Along

new way to trim Michael Hedges

Ian, then of Jimi Hendrix fame;
Hedges gives the song yet
another (rather thought‘-
provokingi interpretation.

The two other covers are more
intriguing still, especially ”A Love
Bizarre,” by Sheila E. Unfor-
tunately for this song (and for the
album in generaI),~Hedges vocal
range does not match his musi-
cal range, and his defects in the
area are clearly shown here. But
the funky, expressive guitar saves
the song. The Beatles’ ”Come
Together” is handled in good
fashion, featuring plenty of tough,
melodic strumming.

All things considered, Live on
the Double Planet is not
thoroughly representative, but
good nonetheless. It portrays a
musician whose tunes are as ac-
cessible as they are virtuosic, and
it gives the listener a chance to
hear Hedges live, outside the stu-
dio. If you like mellow, spacey
music, give this LP a listen.

Grocery store trash isn't worth the priceon the cover

A Web of Dragons
Michael Hartmann
Pocket Fiction

You're in the check-out line at
Giant Eagle. Glancing at the rack
of romance paperbacks and ad-
venture pulp, something catches
your eye. No, not a roach. A
brightly colored and cartooned
book leaps out at you and seduc-
tively says, ”Buy me." A Web of
Dragons is one such book.

The cover is predominantly
red, along with a gold dragon
medallion and cartoon drawings
of characters allegedly in the sto-
ry. Impulse buyers will grab this

book, based on the cartoon of a
macho fellow holding an Uzi
(matches no one in the story plot)

. and the drawing of a sultry, pout-

ing blond woman with bedroom
eyes. Sex and death are motivat-
ing enough for impulse buyers,
but the cover has little to do with
the plot, as further evidenced by
the figures on the back cover (a-n
Oriental man held hostage and la
ragged band of armed men cross-
ing a stream).

The guy with the Uzi, best as
lcan tell, is a former Green Beret
captain named Don Stanton who
gets doublecrossed by his form-
er friend and commander, Gerald
Manheim.

In the story, much to the dis-
may of closet sociopaths, Stanton
never wields an Uzi, nor does he
resemble the drawing. Stanton,
set up for an ambush by his best
friend Manheim, loses an eye
when his helicopter is shot down,
and one side of his face general-
ly looks like a biker gang per-
formed plastic surgery on him.

Stanton gets doublecrossed
over a hoard of gold that Man-
heim is trying to stash until the
war ends, when it can be reco-
vered. Horribly wounded, Stan-
ton drags himself off into the
jungles of Thailand to be
befriended by an opium warlord
who needs him to train his gun-
slingers.

Stanton, over the next few
years of surviving the intermina-
ble opium skirmishes, becomes a
sort of Colonel Kurtz-like war god
known as Duk Ngan Loong. This
appeals to every pissed off vet
who wants to carve out his own
empire.

The nordic beauty on the cover
is Jenny Milton, wife of lawyer
Steve Milton. While in Hong
Kong, Jenny drives to the airport
to pick up a friend but gets in-
volved in the assassination of a
man who has a map showing
where the gold is stashed. She is
kidnapped and taken on a jour-
ney to Stanton’s base, in northern
Thaﬂand.

Floating away with

The Mystery of the Wind-
swept Cruise I

Neil F. Fogarty
Cricklewood Press

The Mystery of the Windswept
Cruise, a book by Neil F. Fogarty,
offers the reader action-packed
adventure filled with suspense
and a touch of romance. It has
everything a reader could ever
ask for in a book.

The plot begins with four col-
lege students who are hesitant
about joining the real world.
When the opportunity presents it-
self, Ed, Mike, Tim and Kerry ac-
cept an internship with
Windswept Cruises. Windswept
Cruises,‘ owned by Kerry's aunt,
is having financial difficulties,
and the offer is too good to pass

up. No. sooner do they arrive,
when they are confronted by sus-
picious characters. Kerry's aunt
has been taken hostage, thus forc-
ing the foursome to make a deci-
sion which alters their lives
forever.

Throughout the book, the
friends encounter mystery and in-
ternational intrigue. I don't want
to say any more which might give
away the secrets captured in this
book. I would definitely recom-
mend it.

This is the first novel by

Fogarty, who has taught courses

at Penn State and here at the
University of Pittsburgh. Fogarty’s
inspiration for this book came
about when he was a student.
Much like the beginning of the
book, a group of friends were dis-

Manheim’s betrayal since 1.7
years after the doublecross, Man-
heim is a contender for the
presidency. He needs the gold to
finance his campaign. Stanton
wants him disgraced politically or
worse.

The majority of the book is
spent on Steve's trying to track
down his beloved but unfaithful
wife, Jenny. While Stanton
emerges as a tragic victim, the
plot lacks depth. Some descrip-
tions of Thailand are interesting,
but the characters come across as
one-dimensional and ster-
eotyped.

Following a mundane, around-

the wind

cussing what the their futures
would be like. Fogarty dreamed
of sailing to the Caribbean. Time
went by, and the years passed,
when in August of 1984, Fogarty
began giving serious thought to
capturing his dream on paper. It
wasn't until December of 1985
that he began to write his book.
After just two months of day—in,
day—out dedication, he set his
dream to paper.
Fogarty is currently working on
a sequel and has since published
a book which is completely un-
related, entitled Starting A Busi-
ness In Pittsburgh.
The Mystery Of The Wind-
swept Cruise was taken to the
Cannes Film Festival last spring.

THEPITT NEWS, Thursday, January 28, 1988

 

Could the disco duck be making a comeback?

The time was the '70s, and
moaning the words, ”Love to
love you, baby,” Donna Summer
ushered in the age of disco. Be-
fore we knew what had hit us,
John Travolta was a star, the Bee
Gees had the best—selling record
of all time, the Village People
were encouraging us to stay at the
YMCA, and the disco inferno was
furiously ablaze.

Thankfully, we got older. Rock
’n’ roll reasserted itself, and the
records by Chic and Lipps, Inc.
turned into frisbees or netted
some quick cash at the used-
record store. The Sex Pistols had
blown the music scene wide

open; the R.E.M.s and U25 were
having their beginnings. Disco’s
carefree nihilism faded. Fast.

JOI-IN
YOUNG

 

But here in the late 1980s, dis-
co has re—emerged, cleverly dis-
guised as ”dance music” and
”pop." And at its source is the
clever mousy cultural icon we've
made of Madonna.

Madonna's music has some-
thing for everyone — hummable
hooks, aerobics-perfect rhythms,
grinding grooves. Best of all, at

the music's center is a chesty,
flexible teaser who combines a
cunning ruthlessness with her
supposed heart of gold. She's
naughty but nice, sexual but safe,
and her themes prove perfect for
pleasure—happy capitalist Ameri-
ca: she said what she wants in

goods (”Material Girl”), and in 

bed (”Dress You Up”), and her
love may be nostalgic (”True
Blue”) or up to the minute (”Cra-
zy For You”). Ultimately, nothing
she said hasn't been said before,
and nothing she sings is likely to
mean much 10 years from now.
She is no lyrical or musical inno-
vator, just a very smart woman

with a good ear for a catchy
melody.

Perhaps the most unfortunate
thing about Madonna is not her
popularity but the trends she has
inspired in popular music. At
least Madonna adapts her sound,

7 occasionally tackles an interest-

ing subject (”Papa Don’t
Preach”) and utilizes the studio
to vary the dynamics of her very
average voice. Even that can't be
said for the latest wave of indistin-
guishable, drum machine—happy
bands recalling disco’s dullest
conventions. is there a difference
between Expose, Jody Watley,
The Jets, Debbie Gibson, Lisa

All the above acts employ
plenty of studio technology and
make crisp, concise records, but
below the slick production is a
heart of lyrical cliches, limited
musicianship and computer
programming. Such records are
easy to make, easy to digest and
ultimately encourage musical
stagnation. They’re popular in the
short run, and apparently, that's
good enough. But while they
clog the charts now, record labels
and radio will continue to ignore
much of the creative, progressive
music being made today. Why
sign a band that might labor for
awhile in the studio crafting their
album when a dance record can
be made cheaper and faster?
Why take a chance on a commer-
cially questionable act when you
know your listeners won't worry

But they are all tied in some
way to the city and are pleased
that they can reach a lot of cities
from Pittsburgh. Columbus, for
example, has several clubs that
showcase reggae bands and one
club, Skankin’, that is devoted
only to island music.

To gain a wider audience, the
band hopes to make some
recordings and get some airplay.
”We want to get some records.
We want to be successful and go

Making RRRecors is their kind of business

Ron Lessard has been a driving force in
the American experimental music scene
for several years. He began his active par-
ticipation with the establishment of the
RRRecords store in Lowell, Mass., and a
comprehensive distribution service that
sells hundreds of experimental records
and cassettes from all over the world.

Lessard’s next step was the formation
of a record label which would go on to
feature the works of some of the greatest
alternative artists, most of whom had
previously released on cassette. As the
physically substantive nature of. LPs
makes them more appealing to the pub-
lic than cassettes, this turned out to be a
wise move.

RRRecords subsequently released 18
records by artists such as Eugene Chad-
bourne, Smersh and Boy Dirt Car. Intelli-
gent radio stations soon became
interested in RRR, and the first Black-
house album and the History of Unheard
Music were exposed on the airwaves all
over the nation.

The latest records from RRR continue
to exhibit diversity and creativity. Black-
house, the mysterious ”Christian industu—
rial” outfit from Salt Lake City, stunned
listeners with their first record, Hope.

Who would believe that behind all the
imposing feedback and pummeling noise,
there was a message of truth and light for
the world? Yet, they claimed to recognize
only two classes of people — believers
and non—believers.

With their second release, Holy War,

RayPop gets all dressed up for the release of their new albu, Pyhe Dls

IEJIDI

Christian moralists might not take so
kindly to the temptation of Debbie Jaffe,
who is also known as Master/Slave rela-
tionship. After seven excellent cassette
packages, Jaffe has arranged her most at-
tractive work yet on her first record, This

ternating domination and surrender. Not
for the timid, This Lubricios Love is a
beckoning black box of sexual power.

capture the atmosphere of their live per-
formances, which feature colorful shows,
but the music of Xray Pop is so nice and

by the French group X Ray Pop. The band

happy you can't resist tapping your toes
to the beat.

Blackhouse has consolidated its hold on
the industrial hierarchy. Their gospel con-

Lubricious Love. She explores the dark,

Way and Mirage lies the Meat

Puppets’ latest, Huevzos. Many,

of the album's songs seem on the
verge of exploding, but then
seem to hold back. Curt Kirk-
wood’s guitar work is often sim-
ple and muted, brother Cris
barely gets to add his distinctive,
frenzied vocal harmony, and
Derrick Bostrom holds back an
all—out drum attack. The melodies
are grabbing but coupled with
some undynamic arrangements.

Still, Huevos manages to draw

, the listener in. Many songs are far

more hypnotic and grooving than
Mirage’s material; the lush, hope-
ful ”Sexy Music” is Meat Puppets
rapture, and ”Look at the Rain”
burns with vocal and guitar fire.
There is some stylistic variety to
Huevos too, from the early ZZ
Top—esque ”Paradise” to the
roots—rock riffing of a cut like
”Dry Rain."

But Huevos remains in a quan-
dary, much like the last two Meat
Puppets’ records. Will the band

ever combine the frenzy of their
live shows with their albums’
melodicism? Are the Meat Pup-
pets now searching out a narrow-
er musical niche to claim? Even
while questions about the Meat
Puppets remain unanswered, an
unbalanced album like Huevos
still sounds unique and refresh-
ing. When it comes to predicta-
bility, the Meat Puppets, perhaps
for the best, ”Can’t Be Counted
On” at all.

Two Steelers make NFL All-Rookie Team

Delton Hall

SAN DIEGO (AP) - Shane
Conlan of the Buffalo Bills was
named the 1987 NFL Rookie of
the Year Tuesday by the Profes-
sional Football Writers of
America.

The linebacker, who was
selected eighth in the first round
of the NFL draft, led the Bills in
tackles with 114. He particularly
prospered when moved inside af-
ter the Bills acquired Cornelius
Bennett to play outside line-
backen

The Bills had two other players
on the team ~— Bennett and cor-
nerback Nate Odomes. New

Orleans also had three players

chosen — defensive end Shawn

|t’s Wednesday at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, and people are
still talking about The Dunk.

It was one of those monumen-

tal moments in sports thatwill.

cause a strange phenomenon in
about five years.

The Fitzgerald Field House
holds 6,798 people, give or take
200, but when Pitt fans reminisce
about The Dunk, somewhere in

"the range of 10 to 20,000 people

will swear they were there.

But on this day, Jerome Lane's
window—breaking is all but forgot-
ten. The only sign of Lane’s slam
against Providence Monday night
is the lack of a basketball hoop
at one end of the practice floor
next to the main court. '

JOHN
ENRIGHT

Some photographers take pic-
tures of Lane next to the damage
before Paul Evans shows up.

Then things get serious, as they
always do. Boston College is next

yon first-place Pitt's agenda, Satur-

0

day night in Beantown.

Evans has a team to prepare.
Not so much for Boston College,
although the Eagles have a true
star in junior guard Dana Barros.

Pitt’s coach has a team to pre-
pare for the tougher tests down
the road. Villanova, Syracuse,
Georgetown and St. John’s loom
on the horizon. They are the
teams that stand in the way of
Pitt's hope for a undisputed regu-
lar season Big East title.

Boston College should be noth-
ing more than a building block
for Pitt's game at St. John's next
Wednesday. '

The schedule said the Pitt regu-
lar season is half over, but Evans
knows that isn't thecase. The first
16 games were the easy part. The
last 16 or more. are what cham-
pions are made of.

Each time the Panthers take the
floor the rest of this season, the
game becomes even more vital.

So Evans isn't about to let his
players breeze through a practice
session just because Boston Col-
lege is up next.

Of course, the Eagles have

beaten Georgetown, so Pitt can't.

take them that lightly.

Last night, Boston College
played the Hoyas for a second
time. Results weren't in at press
time, but don’t expect a big sur-
prise in this one. The Eagles have
only so many surprises in their
bag of tricks.

But practice makes perfect, so

one would never know Pitt is

preparing to play the doormat of
the league.

However, the Panthers are get-
ting ready to go on the road for
six of their next eight league
games. And everyone knows this
isn't the same Pitt team on the
road as it is at Fitzgerald. At least
not yet, that is.

So don't let the Panthers 14-2
record fool you. Yes, Pitt has a
very good basketball team. But
they'll have to get better because
the competition gets a whole lot
better the rest of the season.

What are the keys for Pitt's con-
tinued success?

Here’ just a few:

0 Sean Miller has to improve
his play on the road. Granted,
he's only a freshman, but his play
against Georgetown and Oklaho-
ma left some question marks.
Was Miller intimidated by the
Hoyas and Sooners? i don't think
so, but he did appear a bit shaky
in both games.

The Panthers will need his out-
side shooting, which has tailed
off considerably of late, in the big
games.

0 Has anyone noticed how
much the Panthers have im-
proved from the foul—line? Pitt is
shooting 70 percent as a team.

Jason Matthews is on pace to
break the Pitt free-throw percen-
tage record for one season. He is
currently hitting on over 86 per-
cent of his foul shots.

Miller is also over 80 percent,
while Demetreus Gore is a little
below that ﬁgure.

Of course, percentages don't
mean a whole lot once the NCAA
Tournament rolls around. More
than one good free-throw shoot-
er has been known to choke in
a big game.

But, all in all, Evans has to be
a lot more pleased about his
team's foul-shooting this year as
oppossed to last.

Knight, safety Gene Atkins and
guard Steve Trapilo.

Vinny Testaverde, the first pick
in the 1987 draft, was the top
vote—getter at quarterback in bal-
loting by members of the PFWA.
He was the only Tampa Bay Buc-

caneer selected and one of nine

first-round draftees who made the
squad.

The other first—rounders were
wide receiver Ricky Nattiel of
Denver, tackles Bruce Armstrong
of New England and Harris Bar-
ton of San Francisco, DE John
Bosa of Miami, DTJerome Brown
of Philadelphia, Bennett and
Conlan.

Brian Bosworth of Seattle,
taken in the supplementary draft,

which will cost the Seahawks a
first-round pick this year, was the
other inside linebacker. Alex
Gordon of the New York Jets was
the other outside LB.

Also chosen on defense were
tackle Jerry Ball of Detroit, cor-
nerback Delton Hall and safety
Thomas Everett of Pittsburgh.

On offense, the other selections
were tight end Robert Awalt and
guard Todd Peat of St. Louis, WR

Redskinsand Broncos: what to look for 

By Dave Goldberg
AP Footbalb”-Writer

Here are the matchups for Sun-
day's Super Bowl between the
Washington Redskins and the
Denver Broncos.

When Washington has the Ball

The Redskins will probably try
to run against a defense that
never looks the same on any two
plays; George Rogers (38) will
start in the one running back
alignment, but no matter how
well he's doing, he eventually
will be replaced by Timmy Smith

_ (36), with Kelvin Bryant (24) play-

ing in passing situations and oc-
casionally running the draw.
The Redskins tend to run left,
over Joe Jacoby (66) and Raleigh
McKenzie (63). Jeff Bostic (53)
regained the center spot at mid-
season when Russ Grimm (68)
was hurt and Grimm, a former
All-Pro guard, hasn't been able to
get his job back. They will out-
weigh the Denver-front, particu-
larly 245-pound nose tackle Greg
Kragen (71), the smallest at his
position in the NFL. The Broncos
have compensated some by mov-

ing 240-pound Simon Fletcher .

(73) from defensive end to out-
side linebacker.

Washington's starting
receivers, Gary Clark (84) and
Ricky Sanders (83), are both deep
threats and will be augmented,by
Art Monk (81), the former All-Pro
injured in November, who is ex-

6 pected to be-back. The Skins use

two tight ends, one of them in an
l-back setup at fullback. Don
Warren (85) is usually the block-
er, Clint Didier (86) the receiver.

The key to the multiple Denver
defenses designed by Joe Collier

, is Karl Mecklenburg (77), a nomi-

nal linebacker who can line up
either inside or outside, at defen-
sive end or at tackle in a four-man
front. He and right end Rulon
Jones (75) are the best pass rush-
ers with Ricky Hunley (98) often
coming up the middle.

The Broncos secondary is
banged-up with Dennis Smith
(49) just back from a broken arm
at strong safety to replace Mike
Harden (31) who replaced him,
then broke an arm. Mark Haynes
(36) is the best cover man, back
at his familiar left corner after a
sub-par year on the right side af-
ter being obtained in a trade.

A Redskins quarterback Doug Wil-

liams (1 7) will probably go up the
middle, which Cleveland exploit-
ed in the AFC title game orat
Steve Wilson (45) on the right
side. '

Williams was just nine—for-26
and could be replaced if he gets
off to a slow start by Jay Schroed-
er (10), a Vro Bowler a year ago,
but just a 48 percent passer this
yeah _

When Denver has the Ball

Like no other quarterback in
the NFL, John Elway (7) is the
Denver offense. He has lined up
in the shotgun more than 50 per-

cent of the time in the last two-\

thirds of the season, making the
Broncos the closest thing to a
single-wing team in 30 years.
Sammy Winder (23) lines up next
to him, occasionally taking a
direct snap and running. Gene
Lang (33) is the other running
threat, and Steve Sewell (30) is a
kind of wingback — a running
back who's an excellent receiver.

But the heart of the offense is
Elway throwing to Sewell and the
Three Amigos -—- Mark Jackson
(80), rookie Ricky Nattiel (84) and

Vance Johnson (82). What makes
Elway most dangerous is his
scrambling ability —— he was the
second leading rusher behind
Winder this year, and the threat
of his running for 17 yards on a
third and 16 slows down every
opponent's pass rush, forcing
many to shadow him with a line-
backer. He's also adept at the
quarterback draw, on which he
scored a touchdown in last year's
Super Bowl.

Elway could give Washington
fits. He was 20-of-35 for 282
yards in Denver's 31-30 win at
Mile High Stadium last year. And
Randall Cunningham of Philadel-
phia, who shares Elway’s athlet-
ic ability but not his experience,
ran for 119 yards in 14 carries in
two games against the Skins this
year and threw for four touch-
downs, although Cunningham
was also intercepted five times.

The conventional wisdom is
that Elway is less effective in the
pocket, and many teams like to
shadow him with a linebacker.
Washington's group isn't fast —
the quickest is Monte Coleman,
(51) but he's usually used to
cover receivers like Sewell out of
the backfield. It's possible that
Washington might use Dexter
Manley (72) as the shadow, but
that would also neutralize half of
the best pass-rushing end tandem
of this season, Manley and
Charles Mann (71). The key may
be how much pressure
295-pound Dave Butz (65) can
generate in the middle against
25.5-pound center Mike Freeman
(62), who replaced the injured
Bill Bryan (64) early in the sea-
son. Butz had one of his best
games of his career against Min-

nesota in the NFC championship
game.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 28, T988

One problem for Denver might

be Washington's four-man line -
there are few in the AFC,
although Cleveland used a lot of
it in the AFC title game.

The Washington secondary
prefers man-to—man with Darrell
Green (28) shadowing the oppo-

nent's best receiver. In this case,‘

that presents a problem —- Jack-
son, Johnson and Nattiel are all
deep threats, and Steve Watson
(81) a capable posession man.
Theother corner, Barry Wilburn,
(45) led the league in intercep-
tions with nine, partiallybecause
quarterbacks threw away from
Green. Strong safety Alvin Wal-
ton (40) is a strong run stuffer, not
so strong on pass coverage,
which may free Orson Mobley
(89) or Clarence Kay (88) the
Denver tight ends. ’

Special Teams
Denver placekicker Rich Karlis
(3) had a good season, hitting 18

of 25 attempts this year, and‘

probably has an edge over Ali
Haji-Sheikh (6), who isn't very ac-
curate outside of 35 yards. But
Karlis has missed some big kicks
in his career, including attempts
from 23 and 34 yards in last
year's Super Bowl.

Steve Cox (12) does the punt-
ing and kicking off for the Red-
skins and also attempts field goals
longer than 50 yards. He aver-
aged 40.8 yards with a net of 35,
fourth best in the NFC. Denver's

Mike Horan, kicking in the thin .

air of Mile High Stadium, aver-
aged 41.1, but his net was low-
er, 33.1.

Green has been used as a punt
return man in the playoffs, and it
was his 52-yard punt return that
gave the Redskins their 21-17 win
in Chicago in the NFC semifinal.

Eric Yarber (80) is the prime kick-
off returner.

Denver's prime punt returner
has been K.C. Clark (27), who
averaged 12.9, best in the confer-
ence, and had a 71-yard return
for a touchdown against San Die-
go in the snow. Ken Bell (35) and
Nattiel are the kickoff returners.

Intangibles s

_ The Redskins and Broncos are
the only two teams this decade to
play in back-to-back Super
Bowls, with Washington having
won over Miami in 1983, then
losing to the Raiders 38-9 the
next year in the first of four one-
sided Super Bowls. It was also the
last won by an AFC team.

That tends to negate the ex-
perience factor — most of the
Broncos were there last year, and
Washington has 18 players with

Super Bowl experience. The rest.,;~...,(
‘of the Redskins have been in

plenty of big games —- six playoff
games since the loss to the Raid-
ers and a lot of big division and
conference contests.

Both these teams have incen-
tive, although Denver's may be a
little greater — they were deflat-
ed after losing to the Giants 39-20
in Pasadena last year and dedicat-
ed this season not just to getting
there but to winning. But
Washington, which lost to the Gi-
ants in the NFC title game a year
ago, is not likely to be satisfied
just reaching San Diego.

One possible factor is Denver's
size, or lack of it. »

‘ ln its last two big games —— last

year's Super Bowl and the AFC ti- J‘, ,

Will the Broncos be successful this time?

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

It's been eight years since Doug
Williams has even come close to
playing in a Super Bowl.

In 1979, Williams was the
quarterback of the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, a lowly franchise
that had never made the playoffs,

let alone had a winning season. ’

Yet, the gutsy Williams guided
the upstart Buccaneers, then un-
der head coach John McKay, to
a surprising 10-6 record and an
NFC Central division title. The
Bucs then bolted past the
Philadelphia Eagles in an NFC

semifinal playoff game and

earned a showdown with the Los
Angeles Rams in the NFC Cham-
pionship.

That's where it all ended. 9-0,
LA. ‘

The Rams went on to lose Su-
per Bowl XIV 31-19 to the Pitts-

= burgh Steelers, but that didn't

matter to Doug Williams. He
would have done anything to get
there, and for quite some time af-
ter, it looked like he never would.

Now, the wait is over. Wil-

liams, who beat out slumping
starter Jay Schroeder, will lead
the offense of the NFC champi-
on Washington Redskins this
Sunday in Super Bowl XXII.

But is he good enough to win
the thing? And for that matter, is
quarterback John Elway of the
Denver Broncos bad enough to
lose the Super Bowl twice —— in
a row?

Last season, Elway steered his
team all the way to the NFL
championship game, only to be
beaten 39-20 by an extremely
talented New York Giants squad.

Don't look for Elway and com-
pany to have the lower score this
time around.

Here are a few angles, insights
and comparisons that should ef-
fect the outcome of Super Bowl
XXII:

The Coaching Advantage —
This goes to Washington. Aside
from Bill Walsh of the 49ers,
Gibbs is the finest coach in the
NFC, the conference which has
won five of seven Super Bowls in
the 1980s. Gibbs recharged an
aging offensive unit with a slew

ANALYSIS

of USFL castoffs and has his team
back in the Super Bowl. Since
1982, the Redskins have ad-
vanced at least as far as the NFC
championship game four times.
This is Bronco coach Dan
Reeves’ second appearance.
Who's at Quarterback? —- Ad-
vantage to the Broncos, hands
down. Elway, arguably the best
quarterback in football, can do it
all, and his extreme mobility ena-
bles him to escape a heavy pass
rush, like the one the Redskins
will most certainly put on him,
i.e. Dexter Manley, Dave Butz,
Charles Mann, that group. Wil-
liams, meanwhile, throws the
long-ball well, but many times
has trouble with the short-to-

medium range passes — his
touch, or lack of it, almost made
Gibbs reach to the bench for Jay
Schroeder in Washington's 17-10
win over the Vikings in the cham-
pionship.

Also, Elway has been there be-
fore. Williams has only been
close.

Strength of Schedule — During
the regular season, Denver, out of
the ornery AFC West, battled
Seattle twice, Minnesota and
Chicago, then slugged it out with
mighty Cleveland in the AFC
Championship. The Redskins
dabbled in the deteriorating NFC
East, with perhaps the Minneso-

Eta Vikings being their number

one foe. As for common oppo-
nents, the ’Skins toppled Buffalo,
Detroit, Chicago and the Vikings
twice. Denver smashed Detroit
and beat the Bears in a Monday

night thriller but came up short
against the Bills and the Vikings.

Day Do Run Run -—— Both teams
can move the ball on the ground,
but Washington clearly has the

' better set of backs. Elway was the

second leading rusher on the
Broncos with 304 yards, behind
Sammy Winder, who leads rush-
ers on both teams with 741 yards.
If Williams struggles with the
passing game, look for the ’Skins
to resort heavily to the handoff.

The Rose Bowl Factor —— The
one that really matters. Remem-
ber how Pac-10 has dominated
the Rose Bowl in the 19805?
Well, this year was the first time
since 1980 that a Big 10,team,
Michigan State, has won that
bowl game. In the NFL, only the
Raiders have won Super Bowl ti-

Lady Panthers play for third
straight victory at Villanova

By Matt Martin
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt Lady Panthers basket-
ball team takes a two-game win-
ning streak to Philadelphia
tonight to take on the Villanova
Wildcats in a Big East conference
match-up.

The Lady Panthers are current-
ly riding a hot streak after losing
seven consecutive "games, six in
the Big East. Pitt stands at 8-9
overall and 1-6 in the conference.

Sophomore Lorri Johnson leads
the rejuvenated Pittsburgh squad,
averaging 17 points and nearly
eight rebounds per Big East
contest. ’

Johnson was named freshman
of the week by the Big East after
scoring 44 points and grabbing
24 rebounds in two games last
week.

Johnson received a medical
redshirt last season.

The 5—foot—11 forward scored
20 points and pulled down 14 re-

bounds, both‘ career highs in a
76-66 loss to St. John’s, and then
topped that with 24 points in a
victory against Big East foe Seton
Hall. Johnson had 10 rebounds
against the Pirates.

The Lady Panthers have been
trying all year to establish them-
selves as a fast—breaking, pressure-
defense team, but only recently

have they begun to play that way,

consistently.

Lady Panthers head coach Kirk
Bruce has been shuffling between
11 and 15 players in and out of
the game, trying to wear down
opponents while keeping his
team fresh.

Improved play off the bench,
particularly at the guard postion,
has enabled his strategy to be-
come effective.

But Pitt's play will have to be
extremely precise against the
Wildcats, who, despite losing
three starters, were expected to
finish fourth inthe Big East in a
pre-season coaches poll;

Pitt was predicted to finish
sixth.

Six-foot senior forward Lisa An-
gelotti anchors the Wildcat pro-
gram. As a junior, Angelotti
averaged 13 points and 6.6 re-
bounds in conference games and
was voted a pre—season All Big

East Second Team selection this 

year

Freshman teammates Sandy Lit-
kenhaus and Renee Croft are also
expected to be integral parts of
the Villanova game plan at guard
and forward, respectively.

Litkenhaus is listed as a First
Team All—Freshman, and Croft
was on the All—Freshman Second
Team.

Villanova won the Big East
Tournament last year and has
been invited to the 32—team
NCAA women’s tournament for
the past two years.

The Wildcats also defeated Pitt
both times they met last year.

The Lady Panthers return from
Villanova to play the Lady Friars
of Providence on Saturday. Provi-
dence has already defeated Pitt
once this season 86-78 at
Providence.

Santoro leads wrestling team to 22-15 win

“By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
travelled to Cleveland State last
night and came away with a
22-15 victory.

Pitt is now 7-1 overall and 1-1
in the Eastern Wrestling League.

”The team did a really nice
job,” Pitt coach Rande Stott-

myer said. ”We were able to
take a lot of the swing matches.

That was the story of the meet."

Brian O’Korn got the meet roll-
ing in the right direction for Pitt
by pulling off a 7-5 win.

’’I can't say enough about Bri-
an," Stottlemyer said.

The meet was tied at five when
Pitt's All-American came to the
mat. This was supposed to be the
premier match of the evening.

The match was close early, but
Santoro exploded for a decisive
17-2 victory.

”Pat looked really good,” Stott-
lemyer said. ”They really built
this match up over there. Pat shot
them down.”

Freshman Scott Hovan turned
in the best performance of the
night for the Panthers.

Trailing 6-4 in the final period,
Hovan was able to turn his man
over for a pin.

”This match turned the whole
thing around,” Stottlemyer said.
”Scott went one notch higher and

Pitt's success, Bobby Martin is
running a close second.

Six—foot—9 Martin has played

well the last two games and is

showing reckless abandon going ,

to the hoop. Fourteen foul shots
in 19 minutes against Providence

are/as very impressive.

If Martin continues to show

after intermission last year and al-
lowed Cleveland a touchdown
on its first four possessions this
year —- it would have been five-
of—six had not Earnest Byner fum-
bled at the two as he was going
in for the game—tying TD.

~ Washington, on the other
hand, is not a young team -— it

. has eight players over 30 on its

50-man roster. It didn't wilt in
40-degree weather in Washing-
ton, but who knows what might
happen if it's 70 or so in San
Diego.

Q» The coaching staffs are among
the top three or four in the
league.

Washington's Joe Gibbs, at

. .710, has the best winning per-

1.:

centage among active coaches
despite playing in a tough divi-
sion, and Richie Petitbon is
recognized as an outstanding
defensive tactician — the Vikings
admitted they saw defensive
lineups they couldn't figure out
in the NFC title game.

Moreover, the staff has been
together since Gibbs took over in
1981 with the exceptions of
Wayne Sevier, who moved to
San Diego this year as special
teams coach and Dan Henning,
who left to become head coach
at Atlanta, then returned when he
was fired.

Dan Reeves, at .638, isn't too
far behind Gibbs, and Joe Colli-
er, the defensive coordinator, has

‘ been with the Broncosifor 20
ﬁyears and is a master of quick,

variable defenses that keep oppo-
nents guessing.

may be able to move Gore to off-
guard in certain situations.

0 Naturally, Smith and Lane
have to dominate in the big
games. These two players have

‘enough talent to offset some of

the shortcomings Miller and Mar-
tin may have because of their in-
expenence.

0 The Panthers’ only major
concern is turnovers. Evans
stressed that to his team again in
practice yesterday. I

Turnovers usually plague
young teams, but in Pitt's case,

it's not the young guys who can't
hold onto the ball. r

Individually, Lane, Smith and
Gore have the most turnovers on
the team.

0 Pitt has gotten off to quick

starts in a lot of games lately, and A

that's vital for any team's success.
The 10 most important minutes
of a game are the first five and last
five.

If the Panthers can dominate in
those 10 minutes, not too many
teams will beat them.

pulled out a great match. It was
fun to watch.”

Pitt's Jeff Turner received a for-
fiet for the Panthers’ last win of
the night, but the fireworks wer-
en’t over just yet.

At 190 pounds, Pitt's Perry
Miller held his own against an
opponent who was dominating
the match. Miller trailed, 19-6,
with the last period nearing its
close. He was able to hang on
without giving up another point.

If Miller had, the Vikings would
have had another point on the
scoreboard and a pin at
heavyweight for Cleveland State
would mean a tie.

”Perry did a helluva job for the
team," Stottlemyer said. ”This
was a great win for us.”

Pitt faces Navy and Syracuse at
Annapolis, MD on Saturday be-
fore returning home to face
Bloomsburg next Friday night.

Bucs sign

(AP) ~ The Pittsburgh
Pirates on Wednesday signed
second baseman Jose Lind,
left—handed pitcher Hipolito
Pena and shortstop Felix Fer-
min to one-year contracts.

Lind batted .322 in 35
games and had 1 1 runs batted
in with the Pirates last season.
He was called up from the
team's AAA affiliate in Van-
couver on Aug. 27 and played
every game at second base af-

ter Johnny Ray was traded on
Aug. 29.

In 27 games with Vancou-
ver, Pena was 5-6 with four
saves and a 3.72 earned run
average. He was 0-3 with a
4.56 ERA and one save in 16
games with the Pirates.

Fermin batted .268 in 100
games and had 35 RBI with
the Pirates AA affiliate in Har-
risburg last season. He batted
.250 and had 4 RBI in 23
games with the Pirates.
