English department, says Brumble

Rebecca Riddle

Staff Writer

The dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences says he wants teachers to stop
giving out A’s to students who don’t
deserve them.

CAS Dean David Brumble sent a
memo to the English department on
March 2 saying that the percentage of A’s
given in English courses in the past three
years was unusually high.

“Many of us, of course, would like to
see these percentages lowered,” he wrote,
suggesting that teachers are giving high
grades in exchange for positive student
evaluations.

Ed Ochester, chair of Pitt’s English
writing program, said teachers give out
so many high grades because they want
to encourage students who often have
very high expectations.

Though Brumble refused to com-
ment on the issue, members of the
English department said students should
not worry about grades dropping imme-
diately as a result of the memo.

Students have received higher grades
consistently over the past few years, and
not all faculty have changed their policy
of awarding top marks, according to
Ochester.

Ochester said the problem is not
unique to the English program, and not

unique to Pitt, either. In fact, grades have
been soaring nationally in every area of
study for years, but in Pitt’s English
department, the numbers slowly but sure-
ly began to drop.

“Everybody has the same story,” said
Ochester.

David Bartholomae, English profes-
sor and chairman of the English depart-
ment, said the letter from Brumble fol-
lowed a request by CAS to learn how
writing students’ grades compare to pre-
vious years’. Bartholomae said this will
“give a sense of grade distribution in
courses.”

Fifty—two percent of students in Pitt’s
English writing courses received A’s in

the spring semester of 1997, up from 47
percent the semester before. Last semes-
ter, 37 percent of the students received
A’s.

Ochester said the high percentages of
A’s awarded in English writing courses
probably reﬂect the large number of stu-
dents taking the courses as part of their
majors. He explained that students do
well in these courses because the classes
are part of their major, and that students
often choose majors because they are tal-
ented in that ﬁeld.

In the memo to English faculty,
Brumble asked the professors to examine

Pitt alum David Rossi may
have given Pitt its biggest alumni
donation ever on Monday, but he
didn’t give money.

The 1979 graduate gave Pitt
something much more impressive
— an opportunity to do experi-
ments aboard the May 2000
NASA space shuttle mission.

Rossi is president and co—cre-
ator of Spacehab, a company that
rents laboratory space aboard the
shuttle. He decided to give Pitt the
laboratory space to make the
University the ﬁrst-ever recipient
of free space aboard the shuttle.

Richard Howe, ‘associate
dean of administration in the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
spent most of the day with Rossi

0 when he visited the campus on

Monday.

Howe said Pitt will have the
opportunity to do two protein
crystallization experiments aboard
the shuttle. Pitt hopes the experi-

  racl gives opportunity to
con uct experiments in space

   
   

ments will
open doors
to the possibil— V _
ity of new medi-

cines in the future. A

Rossi said he will let
Pitt ofﬁcials decide which
experiments they’d like to have
performed.

Howe said the University will
let faculty members from the
chemistry and biology depart-
ments collaborate in devising the
experiment.

David Burgess, chair of the
department of biological science,
said he expects the experiment’s
head designer to be either John
Rosenberg, a biophysics professor
who has previously performed
similar experiments in space, or a
group of faculty who are viral-
structure experts.

Along with faculty, graduate
and undergraduates also will take
part in designing the experiment,
Burgess said.

He added that Rossi’s dona-

why grades are so high. He inquired
whether it could be due to “widely differ-
ing standards among instructors” or
because a “different mix of courses was
on offer.” .

But Ochester has a different explana—
tion: students expect higher grades and
teachers are too willing to give them the
A’s.

Teachers want to encourage students
and keep them enrolled in school, he
said, and giving out high grades is a way
of bolstering a student’s conﬁdence.

In the ‘past two or three years,
Ochester has seen an increasing amount
of students who aren’t happy with their
grades. He remembers one woman in his
class who came to him upset about a B
she received on a paper. He told the
woman it wasn’t a bad paper but that she
could do better.

The woman was not satisﬁed with
any grade under an A, regardless of the
amount of work she put into the project,
Ochester related v

“I notice this as a response more and
more,” he said.

Ochester didn’t give her the grade
she asked for. I

These student demands are not
unique to Pitt, according to Ochester —

students all over the country are workingtg):
less and expecting more. h,
A 1990 Carnegie Foundation report:
showed almost 80 percent of four—year ,
college students study less than 17 hoursc:
a week. That amounts to less than one
hour of studying for each credit hour.’
Along with a lessened work ethic, SAT,“
scores went down. 0
Still, grades continue to rise. _] a
As mentioned, Brumble believes that
the teachers who give the good grades C
also get the best student evaluations.
Ochester said the teachers’ motives
are nothing so insidious, and he main—«_-
tains they just want to help their students.
Though Ochester admits that grade
inﬂation is a problem both at Pitt and»
nationally, he so far hasn’t witnessed any C
drawbacks to the practice. A t
Because there seem to be no nega-
tive consequences to teachers for unilat—,
erally giving out high grades, the practice]
continues. . I
The students who work hard and are
actually good at what they study still get ‘
the jobs, he added. « 1
“It’s hard to see how this has dam-
aged a lot of people,” said Ochester. “The .
best of our people wind up in good '
places.”

tion is a “terriﬁc opportunity and a gener-

biological sciences’ mission — “to conduct
cutting-edge research and in most cases
involve undergraduate students in the
research.”

“Science education to undergraduates
is alive and well and thriving at the
University,” Burgess said.

Chemistry department chair Craig

One thing the departments will look
for in their faculty proposals is their ability

Pitt. This is so the ﬁrms can beneﬁt from
products developed from the research and

“Proteins used in [experiments per-
formed] in space are frequently of interest
to pharmacy companies,” Howe said,
“because they are often used for developin
new medicines.” -

Any such partnership would help cut

the costs of preparing the protein for the

Rossi’s donation provides. space on the
shuttle for the experiments to be carried
out. If Pitt were to pay for the space on the
shuttle on its own it would cost $50,000,
according to Howe. But this still wouldn’t
guarantee a slot because companies and
universities often wait for years to get on
one of NASA’s shuttle missions.

Preparing the proteins, Howe said, will
most likely be done by some of the Pitt
graduate and undergraduate students who
work as lab assistants for professors.

“That’s part of what’s so nice about
Mr. Rossi’s gift,” he said. “It will provide
an exciting time of life for the students
involved in getting the protein ready.”

Howe was the assistant chair of the
chemistry department when Rossi was at
Pitt. He said that just after Rossi was
accepted by Harvard’s M.B.A. program,
Rossi asked whether he should go into
business or stay with chemistry.

“I remember urging him to to the
M.B.A. route,” Howe said. “That would
give him a B.S. in chem from Pitt and an

orbes Quad sculp-
ure movin’ on up

Hal Turner
News Editor
A big _bright yellow chunk of
Pitt is movin’ on up — from

‘Forbes Avenue in Oakland to

Park Avenue in Manhattan.

It’s a 23—foot—tall steel titan,
the monster sculpture on the
Forbes Quad patio.

Tony Srnith’s minimalist
piece of art, “Light Up,” took a
trip to Connecticut for restoration
yesterday thanks to gentle-giant
movers Mariano Brothers, Inc.
The mammoth piece will then
travel to NYC in early July to
join about ﬁve other Smith sculp-
tures. But fans of the piece need-
n’t worry, because it will return in
late September.

Minimalism is the l960’s
painting and sculpture move-
ment, launched in response to
another painting trend called
abstract expressionism. While
abstract expressionism focused
on the texture of brushstrokes,
minimalism employed pure color
and geometric shape. Smith is a
premier sculptor of the minimal-
ist tradition, and his works are
widely sought. ‘

“Light Up” and the other
oversized sculptures are part of
NY C’s Museum of Modern Art
(MoMA) summer exhibit of
Smith’s work.

' A few sculptures too large
for indoor exhibition will be
placed in several high-‘proﬁle
Manhattan locations —— “Light
Up,” on loan to MoMA, will rest

  

employees were needed to col-

 

in Seagram Plaza at Park Avenue
and East 53rd Street. MoMA
plans to display some of Srnith’s
smaller sculptures and sketches
in the museum building. The
whole production runs from July
2 through Sept. 22, then “Light
Up” returns to Forbes “Plaza.”

“I guarantee somebody lit up
when they paid for that,” said a
truckdriver —— who asked to
remain anonymous —- about the
price of the art he was about to
drive to Warren, Conn.
Appraisers recently estimated its
worth to be around $1 million.

Before Smith died in 1981,
appraisers set its val.ue near
$90,000, according to Deborah
Rouse, the Facilities
Management employee who
orchestrated the move with
MoMA and the almost one—of-a-
kind moving company.

“I don’t think there’s more
than 25 of us,” said Joe Mariano,
referring to American art-moving
companies. Mariano Brothers,
Inc. only moves art. And being
based in Danbury, Conn.,
Mariano Brothers sits in a prime
location for business in New
England and New York,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

In fact, in May, Mariano
Brothers is moving one of the
most famous and expensive
sculptures of all time — Rodin’s
“The Thinker” — from its home
at Stanford University to New
York for an exhibit in
Rockefeller Plaza.

’ Only two Mariano Brothers

lect the yellow behemoth yester-
day — Joe Mariano and Jay
Merrick. And as Mariano put it,
he’s making “a nice piece of
change.”

The $75,000 moving bill,
footed by NYC’s Public Art
Fund, will go to pay Merrick,
three-truck drivers, and the crane
operators who placed the sculp-
ture’s pieces on the trucks’

ﬂatbed trailers. Whatever is left '

over after insurance premiums is
Mariano’s to keep.

The $75,000 covers the .

move from Pitt to Connecticut to
New York and back to Pitt, and
all disassembly and reassembly
at each location.

It’s deﬁnitely a lucrative
business, Mariano said, primarily
because nobody else wants to do
It.

Mariano and his brother,‘

Pete, started the “rigging” com-
pany 50 years ago this month, as
Joe tells it, because Pete’s boss
didn’t want to expand his own
small rigging outﬁt.

Pete noticed the need in the
marketplace for such a service —
moving enormous, heavy objects
— and when he threatened to
leave and start a new business
with his brother, his boss told
him good luck.

Now Mariano Brothers ships
pieces all over the world, accord-
ing to Mariano. And at one time
all ﬁve of his brothers worked
with him; two have retired, two
started their own residential
moving company and the other
became a minister.

Workers from Mariano Bros. dismantle the Forbes Quad sculpture .i

“Now he does all the praying
for us,” Mariano said. His bright
smile stretched so far across his
face, it pulled his eyes shut.

It’s not the safest job in the
world when you’re, disassem-
bling, moving and reassembling
works of art that can weigh more
than 20 tons. “Light Up” is a
colossal 11 tons, and even when
split into three parts, requires its
transports to sport “WIDE
LOAD” barmers on the way to
the restoration facility.

Rouse said the piece’s
restoration will include sanding
down the raised imperfections,
dinging out the dents, and apply-
ing a blazing new yellow coat.
The improvements are MoMA’s
compensation to Pitt for lending
the sculpture over the summer.

tape.
As the drivers stood with

Merrick unbolted the sculpture’s

noon, Long pushed for Primanti

lot of doors for him.”

Rossi took that advice, and soon after
graduating from Harvard, he and three peo-
ple he graduated with started Spacehab.

Rossi and Spacehab first made news
when they designed and built the Pegasus
rocket system, which NASA bought and
has used several times. In addition,
Spacehab has carried out experiments on
10 shuttle missions.

In January, Rossi was named president
of Spacehab. His efforts for the company
helped it win a contract with NASA to pro-
vide the module that will deliver supplies
from the shuttle to the Russian Mir space
station.

Howe said Rossi not only helped
design and build this module but also
helped raise the $250 million needed to
frmd the project.

In addition to the Mir, Rossi also had a
hand in winning the contract with NASA
for a similar module that will carry supplies
from the shuttle to the new International
Space Station that NASA and other
nations’ space agencies have just started to

Howe said Rossi’s blend of business
and chemistry gives him the tools needed
to help attract companies who will lease
space on future shuttle missions to carry
out experiments.

One of Rossi’s duties is to ﬁnd ways to
promote the space shuttle for commercial
use.

“He’s using the University of
Pittsburgh as an example of how non-
govemment-related research can be con-
ducted as part of the shuttle program,”
Howe said. “Mr. Rossi’s company is
involved with NASA, working as the gov-
emment’s agent to help ﬁnd companies
interested in working with NASA.”

Howe said he is excited about this
opportunity for Pitt and that this conﬁrms
the beginning of space exploration for the
University.

“It’s a momentous opportunity for
Pitt,” Howe said. “And we hope to contin-
ue to work with Mr. Rossi to show how the
University can work with his company to
demonstrate how his capabilities can be
used to ﬁnd research companies who are at
the cutting edge of their ﬁeld.”

back from midtown Manhattan.

They made their opinions of
Primanti’s clear, but what about “Light

art-moving business has given him an
appreciation for art like Srnith’s.

Too many ”A” grades,
not enough challenge

Nobody in his right mind wouldn't want an A grade
in a class. An A means you've done exceptional work
and excelled well beyond what is expected.

At least, that's what an A should mean. But a recent
trend in grading within Pitt's department of English tells
a different story. More ﬂian a quarter of students who
took lower-level English courses last year received A's,
and" within the Fihn Studies program, more than half
received A's last Fall.

That's a disturbing trend, because it means our stan-
dards have fallen drastically. If an A is the average pass-
ing grade for a course, then we have failed to distinguish
between those students who do exceptional work and
those who do just enough.

This argument may be falling on deaf ears.
Mathematically speaking, there are more students who
will feel they've beneﬁtedfrom this arrangement than
will feel otherwise, because they will stand to gain the
most from an attractive transcript.

But they will have meaningless transcripts, as will
everybody else in the country if this trends continues to
spread the way it appears to have been doing.

Even schools with prestigious names like Princeton
tend to grade generously. But Princeton can get away
with that: If you hire a Princeton graduate, you're bank-
ing more on the fact that he was a Princeton-caliber stu-
dent than on ﬂie grades on his transcript

But employers can't bank on the caliber of Pitt stu-
dents, because this University just doesn't have the repu-
tation for enrolling outstanding minds, on average, as do
the Ivy League schools. ‘

That doesn't mean Pitt students aren't as capable as
Princeton students. It just means that, on the average, Pitt
students don't achieve as much as do Princeton students.

If Pitt would adhere to a more reasonable grading
standard, then an A from Pitt would stand out — to
employers, it might even mean more than a B from
Princeton! But if everybody at both institutions receive
good grades, then employers will have no choice but to
assume that Princeton graduates are always superior to
Pitt graduates. ' .

Of course, we're not advocating a strict percentile-
based grading scheme, where 10 percent of students get
A's, the next 10 percent receive B's, and at the other end,
60 percent automatically fail. Such a system is also
meaningless, because it only reﬂects students‘ abilities
relative to their classmates and not relative to their peers
across the halls. '

But if the majority of students are getting A's, then
the material and the course work just isn't challenging
enough.

Anderson

Pushing the envelope — what a
grand notion. It has been impressed
upon me, most likely through acts of
osmosis, that pushing the envelope is
what college is all about.

Students wake up daily, march
olf to David Lawrence Hall, most
likely to some overcrowded auditori-
um, to be subjected to impersonal lec-
turing on the ﬁner points of Gregorian
chant. This mundanity is called for in
the name of higher education, which
we all lmow — at least according to

« the ISO —— istmerely a front for the

perpetuation of capitalist ideology.

We stop at the entrance, bend
down, and we pick up the latest issue
of our beloved Pitt News. Now, this is
where the situation takes a dramatic
turn for the worse. Inside this very
paper, we are subjected to boredom
far worse than that of any apathetic,
tenured professor. We are subjected to
theboredomofourpeers,andifa

ists (such as the staff here) canibore
you daily like this, it doesn't speak
muchforourfuturehopesasaculture.

Wake up! We're in college, we're
young, if we don't push the envelope
now, then when will we ever have the
chance? If you are unaware, then I'll
let you in on a little secret; responsi-
bility sucks! And since nobody else at
thispaperseemsuptothetask,letme
spell it out: Rebel, be obnoxious, be
discourteous, skip class, say "fuck,"
demand entertainment, piss on the
chancellor's lawn, have a 20-keg party

the local authorities when they come
to haul you away.

Can you people really stand
another day of allocation-violation
stories, or how about a pressing

The Pitt News

There's not much time left

"Point/Counterpoint" piece on the
death penalty?

This is how it is: Binge drinking
is a right, not a. privilege, smoking
doesn't cause cancer, too much vita-
min C does, and if you can't say
"fuck" in the college newspaper and
you feel too inhibited to yell it across
the Quad at the top of your lungs in
the middle of a gigantic Pathﬁnders
tour, then you're not fulﬁlling your
duties as a college student. Not to
yourself, and certainly not to this insti-
tution.

It's time that we recognize our sit-
uation. We're not preparing ourselves
for the future. We're biding our time in
hope that the future never ﬁnds us.
And if for some reason you're in total
disagreement with that last statement,
well, fuck you and go get a job. Do we
really imagine a better, brighter future
for ourselves out there in Ever-
Everland? I know people with gradu-
ate degrees in chemical engineering
who are managing video stores! So
don't think you're going much farther
with that BA in sociology.

Who wants to get anywhere any-
way? Is adulthood really such a holy
and necessary thing? I sure as hell
don't see the point in becoming some
lazy functionary lulled to incapacity
by the relentless drudgery of the
postacademic world. What is the need
to eam large sums of money if you
can't, at any point, do whatever in the
hell you see ﬁt?

Okay, maybe some of you are
looking forward to your Toyota
Camrys and your 2.5 children, and
$85,000 per year (combined) income.
Fine, I'll forgive you. I‘rn one for the
argument that an individual's right is
inalienable. But don't be lulled to
sleep already. You'll regret not being

stupid. Besides, your chances for

grabbing life by the balls is slipping

by every second while you read this
story.

Don't get me wrong, don't think
that I'm advocating a rush to vitamin-
C addiction or an end to binge drink-

ing. And when you seethatPathﬁnder .
tour strolling through Forbes Quad, ,

you don't have to greet the future cus-
tomers with a warm smile. All I‘rn

really saying is start a riot on Bigelow ,

Boulevard in demand of better local
bars. Or start a clandestine organiza-

tion that sabotages the SGB electoral .

process. Or invite the local panhan-
dlers to your economics class and
demand that they receive a free lunch

So, if by chance you paid mind 
my little article here, and for some rea-
son you decided to converse about it
over a ﬁne, home-cooked meal at
your nearest campus eatery, then by
all means_feel free to take up one of
the causes I've put forth. Or better yet,
thinkofyourowncausethatneedsa

little spark, a little imagination and a
little college rebelliousness. But what-

ever you do, don't pull another ﬁre‘

alarm in the Towers at 3:30 am, it's
old hat ‘

So as I sit here and philosophize
from my ivory tower of -nocturnal,
nicotine-addled indulgence, as I

ridicule the members of our academic '

community, my peers, my instructors,
my ﬁiends and my enemies, let me
remind you, l'rn only doing so to push
the envelope. And yes, I certainly

advocate your trying to do a little of l

the same.

As Hunter S. Thompson would
say, "When the going gets weird, the
weirdtumpro!" Thank you, and good
day.

Eric Anderson doesn't expect Pitt to
become like 1960s Berkeley over the

summer but is disappointed that it's 

not even as lively as 19403 Berkeley.

A dozen years passed between these
reviews while Pitt did nothing to improve the
quality of education for undergraduates in

worked to perpetuate this imbalance of pri-

more than it rewards teaching.

trade embargo against Cuba because that is
like slamming my head against a porcelain
sink; or a better analogy is a slave arguing
with her master about why she should be
freed. The slave's arguments are based on
logic, reason, basic human rights and digni-
ty, while the masters arguments are based on
greed, circumlocutions and unintelligible
reasoning. ~

Likewise, any argument to keep the '

embargo against Chiba is ludicrous at best. Is
Cuba really a threat to our national security?
And as far as the embargo being a result of
Castro being an iron-ﬁsted dictator who
commits atrocity after civil rights abuse alter
atrocity, well, that argument misses the
make—sense boat.

It's no secret that the embargo still being
in place is a result of a few very select inter-
est groups. Namely, the Cuban—Americans
who used to be Cuba's rich landowners who
exploited the rest of the population, and a
few corporations like Bacardi Rum and the
oh-so-popular tobacco companies. Jesse
Helms has a serious interest in American
tobacco and therefore does not want Cuban
tobacco into America, or other countries for
that matter.

a dead man's eyes that not many people
know exactly what I'm talking about. At least
not speciﬁcally, so let me review: '

Fnst oﬁ, contrary to the Star-Spangled
Barmer, we really aren't living in the land of

the free. We live in the land of the less .

repressed (because we do all the
repressing). For

example, we are not ﬂ
free to go to Cuba
Actually, if you do
go, you can face 10
years in prison and a
$250,000 ﬁne.

We used to be able
to laugh at that ridiculous law
because it wasn't enforced. But guess
what, cousin? The old Treasury Department
is stepping up its attack on our ﬁeedom.
Now it is prosecuting people and sending
threatening letters. (A few Pittsburghers,
including our whole City Council, who just
went there, have received these letters. Bye-
bye First and Fifth Amendments. Nice
knowing you.)

The FBI has also been calling Pitt's
Center for Latin American Studies program
asking all sorts of harassing questions about
the Pittsburgh Cuba Coalition. So, we can't
really laugh at the law any longer.

More importantly than what the embar-

gomeanstousiswhatitmeanstotlreCuban
people. The trade embargo is in direct viola-
tion of all international law, including the
Geneva accord signed aﬁer World War IL
Every year the United Nations votes 117,-3
to end the embargo because it is
a crime against humanity. The
trade embargo against Cuba

o ’ is stricter than any embargo
- in world history. America
forbids food, medicine and

even school supplies from

entering the country.
According to the newly

signed Hehns—Burton Act,

the embargo‘ will only

end when Castro is out of

Which is where the point of this article
comes in. Robin Hood's Merry Band is orga-
nizing a Scottish Games Festival this
Sunday on the Cathedral Lawn starting at
9:30 am. The entrance fee is $8 to compete
and a requested donation of $3 to watch. All
the proceeds will buy pens, paper, chalk and
other school supplies. We ask that everyone
in the area attend this festival —— it is a cele-
bration of spring and rebirth, of new begin-
nings and, more importantly, it is a subtle act
of civil disobedience. It is a stylish, effortless
way to help protest this cruel policy. If

it that said the media is only as liberal as the
conservative business that owns it? Anyway,
we'd like Jews and Muslims, Hindus,

Fifth -year

farewell

I know that almost everyone who is
reading this colurrm is ecstatic over the
little red icon resting comfortably above
my left shoulder that reads, “Final
Appearance.”

Forgive my cliche, but if I had a
nickel for each and every person out
there who responded to my last story for
The Pitt News with a “Thank

(enter the name of your respec-
tive God or symbol of worship)!”

People are dancing in the streets
knowing that never again will they be
subjected to — and I know how devas-
tating this can be to people drowned in
naivete and ignorance —— the opinion of
someone who may not be cut from the
same conservative, mindless cloth.

I can’t even begin to think how, for
three years, I thought that the hard work
and long, long hours put in by hundreds
of staffers here at The Pitt News could
ever be remotely appreciated, consider-
ing our roots or origin.

Yes, tl1at’s right, it took me ﬁve
years to realize it, but the word is out
now: .

All journalists are actually offspring
of the devil.

Satan himself.

We are the scum of the earth, lower
than the low.

How dare we, and I speak not only

every subgenre of creativity that exists at
this newspaper, think that we -—— and I
still fear for my life as I turn these
thoughts into print —— actually think peo-
ple care what we write.

I have been contemplating what to
discuss in this, my last student-newspa-
per column ever, for a long time now.

Over the years, writers have gone
out with guns blazing, leaving no stone
unturned, narrring names and never fail-
ing to pull up short on the expletives.

I have had people approach me and
put me on the spot by asking if, by
chance, I was going to mention them in
my final colunm.

To those people I say this:

If you need me to put your name,

The Pitt News

Rivers Brawl ~' 

Kevin Lil-ley & Matt Mento

The Pitt News

To open their", ﬁve-game
set at Three Rivers Stadium
this weekend, the Pitt Panther
baseball team scored ﬁve runs
in the first three innings
against visiting West Virginia.

Then, the bats stopped.

Thanks to Mountaineer
reliever Jeremy Cummings —
who held Pitt without a run
from innings four through
eight —— the Panthers dropped
their ﬁrst outing at the Pirates’
park 9-8 after a ninth-inning
rally fell short.

“His breaking ball wasn’t
all that bad,” said Pitt third
baseman Darrin Lenhart of
Cummings. “We just jumped
at it. We weren’t patient.”

Lenhart and the Panthers
fared much better against
WVU starter Shane Rhodes,

tle more
than one
inning. The
f r e s h m a 11
third base-
man had the
longest hit
of the day
off Rhodes
in the second — a three-run
triple that dented the TCI
Digital Cable sign on the left-
center-ﬁeld wall. '
Lenhart’s hit was the
fourth straight for the
Panthers to start the second
imring. After his triple and a
Kevin Foley walk, Cummings
came in to relieve Rhodes;
Pitt scored only two more
runs until the ninth irming.
With the score knotted at
ﬁve runs apiece, the
Mountaineers took the lead
once and for all in the top of
the fourth, after left ﬁelder Joe
McNamee’s two-RBI double

put West Virginia ahead 7-5.
McNarnee ranks third in the
nation with 30 doubles.

He would go on to hit two
doubles for his 16th multi-hit
game of the season for West
Virginia. The offensive surge
caused Head Coach Joe
Jordano to go to his bullpen
— Chris Gallick relieved Pitt
starter John Schultz in an
attempt to shut down the
Mountaineer bats.

But West Virginia wasn't
ﬁnished; it added two more

' runs in the sixth after catcher

Brad Elwood gave. the
Mountaineers a four-run lead

  
 
    

with his third of four hits on
the day. Elwood also hit safe-
ly for his 16th multi-hit game
of the season for West
Virginia. He is currently tied
with McNarnee for the team
lead.

After the offensive bar-

rage, Cummings took control .

for West Virginia, shutting the
Panthers down until the ninth
inning.

“We wasted our at bats
today. We didn’t take good at
bats, we have to be more
patient at the plate,” said
Coach J ordano. -

There have been rumors in the league
that Bill Polian, who is currently the Colts’

Matt Townsend

Assistant Sports Edltor

TPN: After a year of experience, will this
season be easier?

Harris: There’s two ways of looking at foot-
ball — the program, and how you play the
game. The program will go smoother. This
year we have more players who are doing
the right things versus the ones who aren’t.
The ones who aren’t will no longer be part
of our team.

I told my players when I ﬁrst got this job
that it is a privilege to play for this football
team. Just because you’re olfered a scholar-
ship doesn’t mean you get a spot on the
team. Their job is to please their position
coach, to get that coach excited about coach-
ing them, versus the position coach having
to be some all-time motivator. The weight is
on the player’s shoulder. Pete Gonzalez is a
good example. He paid attention, and he
pleased the coach. He really bought into
what we are trying to do.

TPN: How did you deal with Tony

THE PITT NEWS

Zirnrnerrnan’s and Kirk McMullen’s olf-
ﬁeld troubles?

Harris: I take everything on an individual
basis. I have learned that through the Tony
Zimmerman situation. Everything will be
individual-based, not on a past track record.
I’m concerned about being fair. The most
important thing in every situati.on is the pro-
gram. Second—most-irnportant thing is next
season. The program will be here far after
I’m dead and buried We look at how have
they been around us. Did they try to please
their coach? Have the treated being part of
the team ‘as special? If they have, and then
they get themselves in trouble, I will have a
different attitude than someone who consis-
tently gets in trouble.

I’m going take some hits no matter
what. Any time a player gets in trouble, he
separates himself from our football team and
puts our team and my name in the paper.
But, as we found out through the court sys-
tem, Mr. McMullen was exonerated for the

erated or he would have been off the

team, because it was his second ﬁght. We
handled our situation, but he still has some
things to straighten out with the University.

I don’t want our players ﬁghting the
same students that are tearing down the
goalposts. I want us to be a family. We want
to enrich the college experience. That’s why
we go over to the band after games, because
I want our players to understand where they
ﬁt in the entire concept of the University.
I’ve been at places where the football play-
ers think they are the university. We don’t
believe in that. We’re not only trying to grad-
uate our players and to build a successful
program, we trying to build the right kind of
people.

TPN: What do you expect of this team the
upcoming season?

Harris: This season will be another very
interesting challenge with this group that we
have, just like every year will be. It depends
on how far our kids come in these 17 weeks
of summer, our training camp, and how they
improve throughout the season. I told the
quarterbacks, “You do what you have been
coached to do, or we’ll play somebody
new.” Is that a threat? Well, I guess it is, but
I’m able to back it up. I am man of my word.
If a starter doesn’t do what he’s suppose to
do, then We’re going to go with the younger
guys.

TPN: VV1th all the leaders gone, who can
lead this team?

Harris: We have some young guys and
some immature guys, and We’re not getting
the senior leadership we got last year at this
point.

I’m counting on every senior. There is no
other year like a senior. This is their last
chance. Every senior should feel the respon-
sibility of their situation. Not everyone can
be a starting player, but everyone can be a

. contributor to the team

Harris on coaching:

The deﬁnition of a coach: You get a guy
todo whathedoesn’twanttodoinorderto
become what he wants to be. To get him to
do what he doesn’t want to do is painful.
One ofmypetphrases aroundhereisthat
“They don’t know, they don’t know. And we
do know.” What we have to do is when the
coach says jump, they say “How high?”

Harris on quarterback Malt Lytle:
People really wonder why I went with
Pete. Some people thought it would have
been better to have gone with Matt. No, it
wouldn’t have been better. Matt is in the best
frame of mind he’s ever been in. He would-
n’t have been there with a 3-8 football sea-
son.IshereadyfortheHallofFame‘?No.
Hehasa1otofworktodo,butheis eager
and he is hungry right now, which he wasn’t
a year ago. I’m real proud of his growth. I

believe he’]l try to get to the next level.

TPN: What growing pains did the team sus-

tain last year?

Harris: We gained some conﬁdence that
only can happen by getting it done. When
we beat Miami, that shot us with a major
amount of Conﬁdence. But it went to our
heads -— so much smoke was blown up our
uniforms. They were bitching about too
much contact on Sunday’s practice. We had
some bumps in the road. That’s why the pro-
gram will be a lot easier, because I won’t
have those complaints along the way. That
was a necessary bump. We had to be hum-
bled because we thought that we had

arrived.

Harris’ Play of the Year: Grant Cofﬁeld’s
fourth-down pass [a fake punt] against
Syracuse to Ernest Coakley, and then we
went down and scored to make it 19-7. Then
we started moving the ball on offense. Then
we gained some conﬁdence and then
momentum changed. We get a couple of
short touchdown drives and We’re ahead.
Playing that. well against a team that we did-
n’t think we could beat really helped us in

our last two games.

TPN: Is this job stressful?

Harris: I’m an emotional person, so I get
my emotions out. I don’t feel any more pres-
sure than atPaciﬁc. This year couldbe hard-
er because of the expectations. We just have
to focus on the details and not on the expec-
tationsbecause I’ve gotto do the job of lead-
ing our organization. Worrying about things
we have no control over isn’t going to help
us. We have to focus on what we can do,

what we can control.

Pitt Track team comes home ,. -

for I998 Panther Relays

Geoff Moak

Staff Writer

This weekend marks one of the
year’s big events for Pitt’s track and
field program. The annual Panther
Relays will be held at ‘Pitt Stadium start-
ing on Friday, with a full day of events
slatedfor. Saturday beginning at 9 a.m.

The meet is the first of only two
home meets for the Panthers this season.
As is the tradition, the meet will be rela-

tively small, with only about nine

schools represented. Most of these will
be local, but a handful will be coming
from as far away as New Jersey to com-
pete.

The highlight of this year’s meet is
the addition of two new events. The hep-
tathlon and the decathlon will be con-
tested for the first time at the Panther
Relays, with events beginning on Friday

afternoon.

The best event of the day should be
the men’s 400 meters. Not only is this a
strong event for Pitt, but the crest of the
ﬁeld will be competitive also.

“Fairleigh Dickinson has some good
runners. So does Essex, and so do we,”
said Pitt Assistant Coach Dave Sobal,
who is the meet director. “The men’s
400 should be a really good race.”

For the women, the 100-meter hur-
dles and the 3,000 meters will be among
the more competitive events.

“I don’t think we’ll see any world
records set, but we should have some
good races,” Sobal said.

Throwing events will be held on the
ﬁelds behind the Cost Center beginning
at 9 a.m. The rest of the field events and
all track events will be in the stadium,
starting at 9 a.m. and continuing through
most of the day.

COLUMN

I contemplated doing several things
with this article, but as I rode through
lovely Oakland on Tuesday night, a

FROM PAGE 11

0 friend of mine made me realize some-

thing:

I. don’t have to come out and men-
tion people directly or bash people, inno-
cent or not, to feel good about myself.

I’ve done enough of that already.

I know that’s what many of you —
and you know exactly who you are —
are thinking right now.

You are probably thinking about
how my words that have appeared here
have absolutely tom the lives of people
apart. ’
How could I possibly live with
myself knowing that something that I
believed strongly enough to write about
— and put my picture by —— has upset
someone?

What was I thinking?

I mean, where do I get off writing a
column about an opinion that I have?

It’s blasphemous. _

It would have been easy for me to sit

0 down "and rant and rave about what I

thought was right and what I thought
was wrong.

I could take potshots at helpless peo-
ple, cursing them up and down, and
maybe even push them right out of town,
but I will tell everyone something right

IIOW.

If you are losing sleep or getting
your skivvies in a knot over what
appears on the pages of this student
newspaper, or any other newspaper for
that matter, then you really have some
issues that need to be addressed.

Seriously.

I have worked, and played, with
some journalistic minds that found it
necessary to try and sugarcoat every lit-

tle thing with the hope that maybe this
would get them some free tickets or
maybe that athlete or coach will really

_like him/her afterward.

Would you like to know the honest
truth‘?

In three or four years, no one is
going to remember, let alone care about,
any story that graced the pages of this
newspaper.

New writers will come in, take the
place of those of us who were forced to
step out from behind the aged monitors
in 434 William Pitt Union, and they too
will write stories that might not be popu-
lar with the masses.

That’s what this business is all
about.

There are opportunities to write feel-
good stories about people or places in
life. I feel privileged that I have had sev-
eral of those, and I am glad to have taken
advantage of them.

They have all been rewarding in
their own respective ways, but what
attracted me the most to writing, and
what has been the most interesting, has
been the ability to, and please check your
copy of the constitution, write an opin-
ionated story when the time calls for one.

You’ve heard about it, I’m sure.

It’s called a column.

And it gives writers the freedom to
escape the press releases, the wire ser-
vices and the stuffy, predictable quota-
tions that accompany almost each and
every story that we are forced to write.

Freedom of speech. '

That really has a ring to it, don’t you
think?

Matt Grove is a columnist for The Pitt
News and hopes there is more to life
than brief talks in elevators and circled
quotations on a framed barroom mes-
sage board.

sive lineman who can stop the run — some-
thing the Rams didn’t do much of this past
year. Although they don’t have a running
game, and they could use a lineman who
can block (other than Orlando Pace), the
Rants will select Jason Peter. Nebraska’s
Peter is the best defensive tackle available in
the draft, and should help the Rams rebuild
their front line.

_ The New Orleans Saints have the sev-
enth pick, and haven’t had a consistent

1,200 yards in 1989. Ifthey don’t sign a free

Since Curtis Enis will most likely be

at least close to going to jail again.
Unfortunately, Enis and Edwards will be
gone by this point. Rusher Skip Hicks of
UCLA would be the. next logical choice
with his big—play ability, but the Ravens are
impressed by another Bruin and will select
safety Shaun Williams.

After analyzing the top 10 picks, we
need to move on to our hometown team, the
Pittsburgh Steelers. The Stcelers have the
26th selection in this year’s draft, and are in
need of a wide receiver after losing Yancy
Thigpen to the Oilers.

One wise replacement would be Kevin
Dyson of Utah, if he slips down to the 26th
spot. Dyson is the fastest receiver in the
draft and comes from a program that throws
the ball very well. If Dyson isn’t available,
the Steelers could take a look at Florida

aging Emmitt Smith. The Cowboys need to
bolster their aging offensive line as well.
However, J eny Jones has always been more
about ﬂash than substance —-— he’ll go with
Randy Moss.

The Jacksonville Jaguars are sitting
pretty with the ninth pick and the 25th pick
as well. The Jags are in need of a pass rush
from the outside linebacker’s spot

They will go with Brian Simmons
front North Carolina. This is an excellent
selection for the Jags, who are looking like
they will be a perennial playoff team for
years to come. The word around the league
is that Simmons is the next Lawrence
Taylor (who also went to UNC). Who
knows? Maybe Simmons will ﬁnish his
career and follow Tay1or’s footsteps into the
WWF to wrestle Bam-Barn Bigelow.

The Baltimore Ravens have ﬁnally
realized that Vinny (we should have beaten
Penn State) Testaverde isn’t their savior.
They traded for “Comeback Kid” Jim
Harbaugh instead of drafting their salvation.

The Ravens have the 10th pick in
Saturday’s draft. They wanted to take a run-
ning back now that Barn Morris is in jail or

frame and is very eager to work hard and
learn — the type of player any team would
covet.

The other local team, the Pittsburgh
Panthers, could possibly have a player or
two drafted. Although none of the Panthers
are rated in the top 10 at their respective
positions, offensive lineman Tony Orlandini
could get drafted in the fouith- to sixth-
round range. His skill, work ethic and talent
should be good enough for him to make it in
the NFL.

Pete Gonzalez will be drafted late, pos-
sibly in the sixth or seventh round Pete has
the skills, but his height (just above six feet)
scares some NFL teams. However, he has
impressed most teams with his strong lead-
ership and charisma. Ifhe’s not drafted, he’ll
deﬁnitely be in a team’s camp this summer
and make the roster.

\V1de receiver Jake Hoffart has had
good workouts for the NFL scouts, but his
speed is a big problem. He has below—aver-
age speed for a NFL receiver, and it will
probably cost him a chance at cracking the
draft. However, some team out there is
always in need of a sure-handed receiver, so
look for Jake to make an NFL roster.

WVU

The Panthers had opportunities in
the ﬁfth and sixth with the leadoff hitters
aboard, but the failure to advance the
runners killed both rallies. Cummings
also helped himself by fanning ﬁve
Panther hitters in seven and one-third
innings on his way to his third win of the
year.

But brieﬂy in the ninth, it appeared
that his third win would have to wait.

Pitt’s Richard Klick led off the frame
with a ﬂy out, but Chris Delsignore ﬁred
a triple to the gap in right-center to start
a one—out rally. Jason Oliver followed
with a run—scoring double, and a Lou
Melucci ﬂy ball landed harmlessly
between WVU’s second baseman and
right ﬁelder, falling for a double and
scoring Oliver.

The two runs pulled the Panthers to
within two, at 9-7, and spelled the end
for Clemens, who was relieved by David
Kloes. Designated hitter Bill. Brown,
who had already struck out and hit into a
double play. then blasted a 2-2 fastball
straight up the middle, scoring Melucci.

Kloes quickly recovered, though,
striking out Pitt’s Harry Ciavarella and
coaxing catcher David Hoopes to ﬂy out
to end the ballgame.

Pitt returns to Three Rivers today to
battle Kent State — a nonconference pit
stop between WVU and Notre Dame,
who the Panthers take on this weekend.

“We’re not looking past Kent State
tomorrow,” said Lenhart, when asked
about playing the Irish.

“But we’re deﬁnitely looking to
advance a little bit in the conference.”
