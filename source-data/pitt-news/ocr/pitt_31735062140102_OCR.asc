  Pitt Equals Penn’s Score

Against West Virginia

Blue and Gold Overcomes Mountaineers by 

Score of 38 to 0—Game Abountls in Sen-
sational Plays—Many Long”Runs‘’

, Are Made.

In a contest’ characterized by many
long runs and spectacular plays the
blue a.nd gold “put it all over” '\/Vest

Virginia on Saturdav to the tune of
38 to 0. In the ﬁrst half the heavy

defense of the Mountaineers held the

varsity to the low score of 11 to 0,
but in the latter part of the game
the Pitt backﬁeld extended itself and
tore ‘things up in great shape, to the
huge discomﬁture of the W. and J.
bunch that had come \up to get a line
on next Saturday’s opponents.
Straight football was used through-
out and Pitt proved‘ itself to be de-
cidedly the stronger-, both on defense
and ottense. Blair played a remark-
able game at guard, while Dallen-
bach always opened up a big hole
when called upon. Budd started the
game at quarter and played fast, but
seemed a triﬂe uncertain about hand-
ling punts. When “Tillie” Dewar
went in to pilot the team he went at
it with his usual snap and enthusi-
asm.

The surprise of the dav was fur-
nished by Wagner, who was substi-
tuted for Eindsay in the latter part
of the game. The way he ra.n down
punts and broke up West Virginia’s
interference brought the_ crowd to
their feet. He is a man on whom
Coach Thompson can, and does put
a great deal of reliance. Captain
Richards was the tower of strength
in the ‘backfield and covered himself
with ‘glory by his spectacular de-
fensive work. West Virginia’s quar-
terback, Thompson, who took Munk’s
place when he retired, got away from
the Pitt tacklers around right end
and with three men for interference
started on a wild ﬂight for the north-
ern goal line for what seemed to be
a sure touchdown. But there was
still one‘ more man to pass and that
man happened to be “Tex” Richards.
All three West Virginia men tried to
put him out of business but in spite
of them all he got through and
.brought down his man on the 10-
yaru line. It was so sudden and so

\

supposedly impossible that the crowd
went wild. VVhen have they seen
“Tex” Richards’ equal on a Pitts-
burg gridiron? Not for many a long
year! I
The Game in Detail.

Galvin started things going by
kicking off to Kinsey, who was
downed in his tracks by Hittner.
After making two tries at the line
Munk fumbled the ball and Billie
Hittner recovered it. Then Rich made
eight yards, but on -the next
play Quailey was thrown for a loss
and a penaltv for offside brought the
ball back ﬁve yards more. Neverthe-
less Budd and Richards managed to

make it ﬁrst down. Two more tries-

failed to add any material gain, as
Ga.lvin dropped back to the 10-yard
line to kick a placement. goal, The
ball, however, sailed wide and was
put in play on the 25 yard line. West
Virginia could gain nothing through
the Pitt defense, so after two tries

interfered with, Pitt was penalized
and the ball given to West Virginia
on their 40-yard li11e. Munk again
punted and Budd returned 20 yards,
but the same offense of interfering
with the ends was charged, so the
ball was given to West Virginia on
the Pitt 35-yard line.

Here was West Virginia’s chance
but they could gain nothing through
the line or «around the ends. Lindsay
then blocked Munk’s punt, which
was recovered by Dallenbach. Budd
was thrown for a loss but “Rich”
ma.de a quick kick over the line of
scrimmage and Hittner beat them all
to it, getting away for a touchdown.
Galvin kicked the goal, making the
score 6 to 0.

On the kick-off Baughman booted
over the line and the ball was put in
play on the 25-yard line. After
Quailey failed to get around-right
end there were two ‘exchanges of
punts and the ﬁrst quarter ended with
the ball onVPitt’s'30-yard line.

Engineers Hold
Big Banquet

 

Large Body of Engineering Stud-
ents and Faculty have Enjoy-
able Evening.

 

GREAT ENTHUS- _
IASM SHOWN

One of the liveliest and most in-
'teresting events of the school year
was the banquet of the Engineering
students and Faculty held last Friday
evening at the Seventh Avenue Hotel.
The object of the affair was to enable
the members of the different classes
to get acquainted wi'th each other and
with the faculty, and, on this basis
alone, could be considered a remark-
able success. Aside’ from this, every
one of the large number present had
a most delightful time, and in the
speeches made by the faculty and by
outside engineers who were guests of
the evening there was a singularly
happy combina'tion of seriousness and
hilarity. Moreover, the songs, yells,
and hand clapping kept everybody
livened up, the sad little ditty con-
cerning Mary and the marmalade,
making an especial hit with Dr. Bi-
shop and Chancellor McCormick.

Dr. Bishop acted as toastmaster,
and started out by forbidding anyone
to “talk shop,” and, while ‘the com-
mand was not obeyed literally, “talk-
ing shop” was kept rather in the back-
ground. .

Chancellor McCormick was ﬁrst
called on, and after expressing his
pleasure at being present, ,,he half
apologetically stated th-at he could
hardly refrain, either from talking
about the University or from preach-
ing a sermon. He then took as the
“text” of his talk “Subdue the earth”
(taken, as he phrased it, from some-
where in Genesis) and-spoke briefly
of the dignity of the "engineering. pro-
fession and of the work the engineer
was doing in helping humanity know
and apply the physical sciences in
conquering the earth. A peculiar in--
terruption occured in his talk, when
Professor Smith was found gazing in-
tently at a mysterious combination of
figures something like 15l22_-4l6--
9602621, which, when held up to the
light in a certain way are capable of a
very" tender and touching translation.
Professor Smith was calmly engaged
in solving the mystery when Dr. Mc-
Cormick noticed him and caused great
joy among the howling mob present
by dragging him into the limelight for
an official investigation of his con-

duct

search as carried out by Professor
Duncan.
of the course in Chemical Engineer-’
ing at the University.

As outlined in our issue of las"E
week, the fellowships in Industrial
Chemistryrequire the appointment of
exceptional men to work along highly
specialized lines in certain industries.
These _men become better acquain'ted
and are better experts in. their line-
than any one in the world.

By the new arrangement, students
in Chemical Engineering will work
during the last years of their course
directly under one of these men, and
when they graduate from the Uni-
versi'ty, they will have a technical

knowledge concerning one particular’

industry that is impossible for them
to obtain in any other institution.‘
The course in Chemical Engineer-
ing is laid out on very broad 1ines,iso
that the_student will have a clear
working knowledge of the fundamen-
tal principles of Chemistry combined
with a sufﬁcient amount of fundamen-
tal ‘work in engineeringito give him a
grasp of the problem involved in such
a course. To this end, a ‘student will
be required to take thorough train-
ing in ilnorganic, Analytical, Physi-
cal, Theoreticaliand Organic Chem-

istry both in the class room and in 

the laboratory. .

The work in engineering includes
such fundamental subjects as -draw—_
ing, theore‘tical and applied Mechan-
ics, Steam Engineering, .Electrical
Engineering, and Engineering Lab-
oratory.

The instruction in industrial Chem- ,

istry will include both lectures and

laboratory courses under the direction 2
of Professor Duncan with the -as-- -, .

sistance of his fellowship men along
their various lines.

Under the co—operative system ex-
isting in the School of Engineering :1.
student in this course will become
familiar with the work as it is actual-
ly carried out in manufacturing
plants; he will have highly special-'
ized training under these men who
hold fellowships in Industrial Chem-
istry in the University. Consequent-
ly at the close of the course he will
have both atheoretical and practical,
training in Chemical Engineering.

WHY Nor HERE.

Evey college in the land‘ of any con-
sequence has a German Society,
known as the “Deutch Vereinj’ The
main feature «of the organization is
the study of the German language in
a systematic and interesting way, by
the use of conversation and personal
contact with German people of educa-
tion. The German department’ of the
University has grown with such re-
markable rapidity in the last few
years, that it not only seems advisable
but almost imperative to organize
such, a societyhere. The proximity of
the German club on Craft avenue
would make, it possible to come in
touch with all the leading Germans of
the city. From time to time {plays
could be given in.the native tongue,
which would be a fitting demonstra-
tion of the work done. At 'this period,
when the University is expanding in
so many ways, it seems proper that
some such move be made towards
thelp-erfection of the plan.

P SHOULD BE DONE.

The attention of the “Weekly” has
been attracted to the fact that our
football rooters are not showing the

proper courtesy to the visiting teams.

when the yells and songs given from
our side of the ﬁeld interfere with the
calling of the opponents’ signals. .We
understand that this has been done to
some small extent in the last few
games and has been noticed by the
spectators. If this be the case it
might be advisable to be a little more
careful. Thematter was suggested to
us and the students can accept the ad-
monition just for what it isworth, as
the thought’ came from outside
sources. -

This yearfs Pitt team promises to be
one of «the best scoring machines in the
history of their activities on the grid-
iron. _ Back in. 1905,- the
eleven scored 440 points to their op-
ponents’. 56. Thirteen games were
played that season, however, whereas
only nine games are on this season’s

card.

The 1904 team, which’ gave Penn

‘State the worst defeat it has ever re-

ceived at the hands of a Blue and Gold
eleven, scored 407 points to 5 for thei-r

‘opponents. These ﬁve. were-made by,
Penn State in’ the last.game of the sea-

son. -

‘This year’s team should have no
troublelbettering the records made in
1905, 1907, 1908 and 1909 in matter of
points scored. The athletic records
show the following: 1906, 254-55'; 1907,
147-27; 1908, 140-36; 1909,‘ 94-26.

New. Arrangements for Chapel.

The system of chapel exercises has
been re-arranged. Hereafter, Monday
morning will be devoted solely, to re-
ligious exercises and to the religious
organizations of the school. Wednes-
day will be devoted to class‘ meetings,
student mass meetings, and other
events of this sort. Friday will be
given over to special lectures, for
which a regular program is ‘being ar-
ranged. .

Considerable comment has been

,made on the small attendance at chap-'

el on ordinary occasions, particularly
when contrasted with the overﬂowing
condition of the room when some-
thing special is going on. It. is re-
questedthat. hereafter the class presi-

PITT WEEKLY BOARD MEETS.‘

A meeting of the staff of the
“Weekly” was held, Tuesday, Novem-
bet 1, at the Phi Zeta Phi Fraternity
house. Ways and.means of booming
the paper and getting in still better
touch with all the schoolactivities,
-and particularly with the students
of other departments were discussed,
and also an effort was made to get
the work of the staff systemized so as
to get the least friction and the most
effective results. In the absence, as
yet. of a permanent ofﬁce, these meet-
ings will be held regularly about
every two'weeks, the next being
scheduled for November 15. Such an
arrangement gives the staff a good
opportunity to talk things over and
get everything running smoothly. In
this connection, the willingness of the
staff to receive suggestions from 'the
students, cannot be over-emphasized.
as only by this means can the paper
become a thoroughly representative
student organ‘. 1

In the second period Brown was

started off by punting. West Vir-

and then tried an onside kick. Budd
recovered it, and just to show them
how to do it Richards executed an
onside kick. This time Peacock re-
covered it and ran 45 yards for.a

“Tex” Richards returned the kick-
off to the 25-yard line and Budd fol-
lowed by a 35-yard run. aided by“the
good interference of Hittfier. A for-
ward pass failed, but Hittner got

away for 20 yards. Another forward

pass was tried but it fell into West

ately punted. Budd returned it to
the 25-yard‘ line and after gaining nine

for Munk‘ "at quarterback and before
very long he got away for a 70-yard
run,ronl'y being broughtidown by the
wonderful work of Captain Richards.
This _landed the ball on the 10-yard

play‘ and threw the runner for a. big
loss. Kinsey then dropped back for a
ﬁeld goal but missed by a small mar-
gin, After an exchange of punts
Budd and'B1-‘own worked the ball to

a couple of bad fumbles, but Hittner
and Dallenbach recovered them. The
period ended. with the ball on West
Virginia’s 15-yard line. The score 11

The same lineup took the ﬁeld in,‘
the second half with the exception .‘ ..

of Dewar for Budd. In returning the
kick-off Kinse" was knocked uncon-
scious and was carried from the ﬁeld

P in an auto. It was said that a piece of

chewing gum had lodged in his throat,
choking him. Baughman then punted
to Dewar who ran through a broken
ﬁeld to the 70-yard line. Richards
failed twice- to gain anything through

MIKE IS DISPLEASED.

Although Penn beat the Carlisle
Indians Mike Murphy, their athletic
coach and trainer, was anything but
pleased  the. exhibition his proteges
put up. In an interview after the
game he said: ~

“It was the poorest game from a
Pennsylvania standpoint that has
been played on iFra"nklin Field this
season.- The team did not show what
it really knows. The line failed to
hold and there seemed to be no gin-
ger in the players. Penn was ex-
tremely lucky to get away with the
two ﬁrst touchdowns.” .

IF THERE IS ROOM.
A traveling salesman died very
suddenly in Kalamazoo, Mich.- His
relatives telegraphed the iﬂorist to

make a wreath; order-ed that the rib- ~

bon should be extra wide, with the
inscription, “Rest in Peace,” on both
sides, and if there is room, “We Shall
Meet in Heaven.”

The ﬂoristwas out of town and his
new assistant handled the job] It
was a startling ﬂoral piece which
turned up at the funeral. The ribbon
was extra wide, and bore the inscrip-

tion,« “Rest in Peace on Both Sides,

and If There Is Room We Shall Meet
in Heaven.”-——National Monthly.

.CL-DB PRACTICES.

The regular weekly practice of the
Mandolin club was held last Friday
evening, in the assembly room of
Thaw Hall. Plans are being made for
a successful preliminary concert on
the evening of Thanksgiving’ Day.
Assurance has been received from
‘the authorities at State College that a
small con_tingent of the glee club will

come to Pittsburgh for the combined _

concert of the clubs.

Crowded Conditions’ In State Hall.

The increase in the growth of the
University this year is particularly
brought to notice by the crowded con-
ditions in State Hall. It has been
necessary to divide the Fresh English
class into several sections and to
make the same room serve the pur-
pose of a lavatory, drawing and lec-
ture room. ’

(Continued from ﬁrst page)

Dr. ,McCormick’s speech was fol-
lowed by talks by Professor Kintner,
Linhart, and Stewart, and also by Mr.
Cotfrain, (WUP-’83) of Jones and
Laughlin, Mr. Manning, resident en-
gineer of the American Bridge Co.,
and Mr. Scott, of the Westinghouse‘
Company and incidentally of the board
of ‘trustees oflthe school. All" of
these men

of the character of the student rather

than his mere knowledge as the deter- "
mining factor of his success in life.’

These somewhat serious speeches
were followed later by talks in lighter
vein by Professor Wenrich, Richard-
son, Harris, Vogt, Lambie, Silverman,
Weber and Dr, Frost, and i't may be
said in no disparagement of the real
lessons brought out by _the first
speakers that these later talks and

stories..were more in keeping with.

the_Iframe of mind of the students on

that particular evening than the ﬁrst .

remarks. '

Incidentally, members of the ban-Ni

quet committee were called on -and

responded with a degree of unwilling- A
ness not. at all commensurate with '

their zeal and enterprise in getting up
the affair. The members of the com-
mittee are certainly to be congratu-

lated for their good work, and it is to,‘

be hoped that this affair ‘willmbe far
from the last of» its sort.

TWENTY IN NIGHT MINING

This Fact May Rearrange Senate‘
Elections.

Since the night school of mining
started, twenty students have_ been
enrolled. These students, together
with the regular day students, give
the school a sufﬁcient number to elect
student senators, and on this account
the election held by the miners, in
conjunction with the engineers, may
become void.

student body is getting rather “hot

they have. Here two years in suc-
cession, the students have paid their
hard earned ﬁve dollars for a little
red book, containing twenty coupons
and only nine of them are worth any
more than the paper they are printed
on. Critically the football tickets a.re
the only ones they can use. Now why
not have a basketball team this year’

Deans of Various Schools Report a _

Extracts froimireports made by Deans
at General Faculty meeting, which fol~
‘owed the faculty dinner at University
Club, Thurs(la_y, November 3, 1910.

Dr. VVadsworth: “The enrollment in

the School of Mines is one less than
was anticipated, as one father sent: his
son to the Dental School for a course
in excavation.” ‘

Dr. Friesell: “We have in the Den-

tal School 150 students. of whom fouri
are women, 145 men and one mining"

student.”
Prof. Chambers: “The greatest in-
crease in enrollment, thir year, is

shown by the School of Education. As
we had no students last year our in-
crease isi ﬁgured. by nothing short of
infinity.”

Prof. Smith (School of Economics) :<

“VVe have an even greater increase than
the School of Education.’’‘

\ Dean Shafer: “The Law School has
had only one graduate fail in the State
Bar examinations, and I think that must
have been a fluke.”

One point brought out at this meet-
ing ought to be of interest to every
student, namely, that n-ot a single stu-

dent in ‘the Schools of Law, Medicine

and Dentistry failed’ to pass the State
Board examinations last year.

Alumni Notes I

Dean F. S. Bishop of the School of
Engineering announces that a ban-

‘quet of the alumni of that depart-
; ment is planned for January 19, 1911.

It will be held in Thaw Hall and will
be a strictly, informal affair. Al-
though it might appea.r that this an-
nouncement is rather premature, ow-
ing to the fact that the date is over
two months off, it is aimed to have

the different alumni classes work it

up. among their members and en-
the largest
outgathering that has ever attended
a‘ similar event. The building willbe
inspection and everyone
given an opportunity of witnessing
the remarkable strides which have

been taken in building up the Engi-

neering school since the new building
was occupied. The ‘committee plans
to have the undergraduates act as the
part of demonstrators, as it might be

termed, on that'evening, and all the

shops-and laboratories will be open

‘with a quota of students engaged in

their routine work.

The Engineer school needs the

‘help of the alumni body more than
fever at this time.
' ierative plan will be started early next

The new co-op-

years and the co—operation of the men
who are out in the business ‘::orld and

_who received their early‘training un-
 der the walls of “Old Uni” will be" a
_big help to the faculty in making a

success ofthe scheme. As is the

 ; case‘ with tall-eiinstitutions of learning

there is a certain percentage of the

 alumni bodywhich might be termed

“the faithful few.” These men are
always ready to lend their time and
money in advancing the interests of
Alma Mater. There are two
other ‘classes which should go under
the headings of “The Possibilities”
Of the latter
class, little help can be expected, but

we-are glad to say that they are
largely in the niinority. The other
class, however, is the one which

9’ opens a wide field for the-Univers‘ty

workers. It is these men whom we
wish to convert into enthusiasts. If
they once become" interested, they

will be able to do great work for the
University. ‘Many of them occupy
highly responsible positions in the
business world. The engineering ban-
quet committee is , going to get as
many of these men out as possible
January 19. They will be able to see
what great work the’ Engineering
school is doing and will hear of the
plans which are to be carried out ‘in
the future. ' '

gineering graduates “make good” in

Facts of Interest Presented by
Doctor McCormick.

 

On Februa-v 28th. 1912, the Uni-
versity" of Pittsburgh will appropri--
atelv celebrate the 125th anniversary‘
of its existence. For thirtv-ﬁve years
of this period it was an academy. For
seventy years more i't was a college.
The remainder of this period it has
been a University. February 28th,
1912, will be a great occasion. We
hopeto celebrate it not only with ad-
dresses and the conferring of degrees
b_ut also with evidence of vitality in
the growth of its student body and
its material resources.

Not until now has the University
possessed an abiding place worthy
of its location in a city of such com-
manding , importance ' and large
enough to provide for the buildings
necessary for its work. T11; .ime has
at last come when the friends of the

once to do large things for the his-
toric educational institution of Pitts-
burgh and to perpetuate the memory
of men who in days pa'st have helped
to make our city what it has become.

The growth of the University of 9

Pittsburgh is phenomenal. Nearly
six hundred new students have reg-
istered in the various schools this
Fall. The College and Engineering
Schools have more new students this
session than they had all told six
years ago. “The ‘School of Liberal
Arts is this year exactly ﬁve times
as large as it. was in 1905. eThe
School of Engineering is 61 per cent
larger than it was last year. The
School of Economics, just beginning
its independent existence, registers 52
students in the regular four years’
course and 120 students in its special
evening classes.. The School of Ed-
ucation, also in its ﬁrst year, regis-
ters its regular entering students in
the School of Liberal Arts; but the
total number of students in this
school, including the , extension
courses, is already over 500. The total
registration of our Universitv for the
year will be nearly fourteen, hundred‘
students.

The organization of the University
was fully. ‘conmleted only during the
year 1909-10. It is now a compact,
highly organized and efﬁcient insti-
tution.of learning. Each of its eleven
schools, with one exception, has a
Dean as its head, and every one of
these Deans is planning for the en-
largement and increased efficiency of
his school. Each man starts out with
the theory that his school is the mostl
important department of the institu—l
tion, and the generous rivalry thus:
manifested must inevitably result in?
both larger numbers of students andﬁ
in better work in each school. Thel
fact is that the‘ University, with its;
body of trained specialists and en-}
thusiastic teachers, is now a bee hivel
of industry and the spirit of higher:

endeavor is pervaciingevery part of!

nently the School of.Engineering. In
the pages of this issue of the Weekly
will be found a description of-the
scheme whereby it is planned to join
the University and the industrial es-
tablishments of the city so closely
together as that each will serve the
other to the immense advantage of
both. fhe city scarcely less ‘effectu-

ally serves the Schools of Mining,“

Medicine, Education, Economicsand
Industrial Chemistry. The vast labor-
atory of practical sciencein our com-

munity will inure remarkably to the

advantage of the student in almost
every department of study. The
School of Liberal Arts, of Law, of
Dentistry, of Astronomy, and of
Pharmacy are all made more effective
by their close touch with such a
community as Pittsburgh. ' ’
What the University now needs is
more buildings. properly equipped,
and larger endowments in order to
provide for the cost of instruction.
These it must have. It is impossible
to maintain an institution of such
size and completeness without large
gifts. In America the students in a
University pay at most only one-
third the cost of his education. The
other two—thirds must come from en-
dowments and gifts. For our Uni-
versity the sum of $150,000 is re-
quired at once for equipment and cur-
rent expense and $1,500,000 for the
permanent needs. The University is
at this time engaged in the movement
to secure these sums which are ab-
solutely imperative. , It deserves and
expects help of alumni and friends.
The Universitv belongs to Pittsburgh

rejoicing and congratulation. We
want the students to work for a
building of their own for social and
religious uses. We want the alumni
to seeto it that a gymnasium or
other needed building shall represent
their enthusiasm for their University.
We hope that the women of Pitts-
burgh will unite to beautify and
adorn the campus’ and make it the
very ﬁnest in all the land. Nature
has done great things for our Uni-
versity grounds. It needs only that
we supplement nature’s handiwork
with intelligent and skillful art in
order to make itrthe most beautiful
and distinctive thing, not ‘in our city
only, but in our country as Well. We
hope that many individuals may be
moved to contribute in buildings, in"
endowments, in scholarships and
other gifts memorials of themselves
or of others and thus add both to. the
facilities of the University‘ and the

adornment of the city. In short we

conﬁdently expect the co-operation of
the people, both in Pittsburgh and in
the wider region the University
serves, to make our University great
and in the highest degree useful and
efficient. February 28, 1912, is the
day on which much of this vision
should ﬁnd realization.

ATHLETIC COMMITTEE MEET.

Question of Pennant Emblem
‘Discussed.

 

At the regular meeting-of the Ath-
letic committee last .VVe‘dnesday, a. re-
quest was turned in by Spaulding’s,
that some special emblem be adopted
in the design of new Pitt pennants.

A student committee was appointed to‘

look into the matter and to adopt
some particular design.- Practically
all the other business was regular
routine work. One “beautiful” fea-
ture of the meeting was that it was
the ﬁrst'meeting this“ year at which
all the student members were present.
Such a thing is almost unprecedented,
but it is hoped for the sake of the
student-body, that it maybe contin-
ued. T

‘ 0 Freshman F oot-Ball

3 Fresh are defeated in First Game
at Blairsville—Lose to E. _L. A.
by small Score. »

 

 

The Freshman football team is’rap—
idly getting into shape. Only two
games have been played so far, and,
while the Fresh were defeated both
times, the reverses were due moreto
lack of practice and team work than
to lack of-ability on the part of the
individual members of the team.

On October 29, Blairsville High

Blairsville, has a good heavy team,
and, considering ‘that this was the first
game the Fresh played together, the
showing Was‘n0t at all bad. On
VVednesday,_November 2, East Lib-
erty Academy was played and they
won, 10 to 6, scoring two touchdowns
to the Fresh’s one. Miller of the
Fresh played a good game, on one

run. Slippery Rock ‘was scheduled
for November 5, and Manager Camp
has another game down for Novem-
ber 14, atlndiana Normal, with sev-
eral more games in prospect.

Among thegmen "out for. the team
are, Pratt and the Campbell brothers,
in the backﬁeld, and, for the other
positions, Kerr, Hemphill, Cummins,
Hockensmith, Rosenthal, Kennedy,
Miller, Kane, Camp, Baldwin, Murray,
Powell and .a number of others.

Lack of practice has always been
the bug-bear with our class ‘teams,
and it seems ‘that the only way a class
team can~get practice is to play out-
side‘teams. While the ﬁrst results
are never promising, such work tells
in the end. _It is probable also tha't
the Fresh may succeed in .lining up
against the Varsity in practice. This

' sort of thing will soon whip. them into

shape, and the school may expect to
see _ a thriller when ‘they line up
against the Sophomores "at the close
of the season.

THE PITT WEEKLY

:. Prof. Kintner

Makes Clever Points

\.._————-g

Co-operative Plan is Given Clear

Interpretation in Address be-‘

fore Theatre.

 

An address delivered by Professor
S. M. Kintner, head of the Department
ofiElectrical Engineering at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, at a meeting of
the Faculty and parents of the stud-
ents of the School of Engineering

‘held October 27, 1910.

This plan has three distinct points
of view, that of the student, that of

“the University and that of the manu--

facturer or employer.

Considering these ‘in the inverse
order of that named, let us see what
is the view point of, ﬁrst, the manu-
facturer, or employer. Tophim it is a
strict business proposition. ‘He does
not undertake it from any motive of
philanthropy. He expects a fair re-
turn in_ labor for the money that he
expends. He does not expect to have
the general discipline of his force in-
terfered with and cannot therefore,
grant any very special privileges. He
offers the students an opportunity to
see and study his works and methods
while carrying on certain duties to
which they are assigned. He realizes
that there will be a certain advertis-
ing feature as the students will know
of his product, will talk about it and
possibly be instrumental, in making
sales of it, as they go out into actual
engineering work upon the comple-
tion of their course. ’

The manufacturer‘ sees still another
‘advantage for himself in the‘plan, in
that it puts him in touch with a num-
ber of young men, who are just start-
ing their training for lines of work
in which he"is interes'ted, as an em-
ployer. He is afforded an opportunity
of looking over these young men and
picking out such of them as appear
particularly good.- He can then sug-
gest certain lines of training that will
ﬁt them for hisrequirements, and
he, in this way, has a chance of train-
ing _up picked men for his force, with-
out expense_'to his company.

So much for the manufacturer or
employer. Now for the University’s
point of View.

Anything that will result in an im-
provement in the students will react
favorably on the University. The im-

 provement in the studen'ts will add

life and interest in the faculty and the
bringing'in of new problems by the
students direct from the up-to-date
practice will assist very.ma'terially" in
keeping the instructors keyed up to
the pr_oper pitch.

From a strict ﬁnancial point of
view, the University will be the loser
unless improved economies due to
increased numbers of students, can be

made ‘to offset the increased expense.-

Universities, however. do not declare
their dividends in dollars and cents,
but in high grade men,‘ and anything
that will produce results of that kind
i will meet the necessary approval and

backing.

Now to discuss the student’s point
of view, the one of the ‘three in which
you. as parents and students, are most
interested.

As a matter of convenience in dis-
cussion, I have noted a number of
points which I will discuss -as a-b-c,
etc., in the following: -

(a) An opportunity is afforded the
student early in his course to deter-
mine whether engineering is the pro-
fession in which he desires to do his
life work.

If after one or two practice periods
in the shops or ﬁeld work, he ﬁnds
he has made a mistake, it will not be
too late to change to some other line
that is more ‘to his liking.

I believe but few students under the
old plan have an idea of what is ex-
pected of them when thew undertake
to -ﬁll their ﬁrst position after ~radu-
ation.

(b) The student is afforded an ex--
cellent object lesson of the relative
value of muscles and brains. He sees
men typical of both classes and I be-
lieve these two pictures will tend to
strengthen his estimate of thepvalue
of the brain training.

(c) Most of the large manufactur-

ing companies have found it neces-.

sary to supplement the ordinary col-
lege course by an apprenticeship of
two years or so. I believe this co-
operative plan will tend towards an
economy in reducing the length of
apprenticeship.

(d) Increased efﬁciency is almost
certain to result from the training of
doing things in a systema'tic way and
from the almost soldierly discipline
that is in use in many shops.

(e) Many opportunities, during
these practice periods, will present
themselves for an early application
of the principlesand theories taught
in the class-room. This will unques-
tionably {result in a be'tter understand-
ing of these theories and bring up new
points, little side issues so to speak,
that «will serve later as fruitful points
for discussion in the class-room.

(f) The study of practice in the
shop, where practice is made, in place

of from books, will not only be more

effective in ‘teaching that subject. but
will result in a saving of time in the
class—room work, which can be used
to much better advantage in a more
thorough and extended theoretical
training.

~(g) This division of the work be-
tween theory and practice, in which
the student is‘shif’ted from class room
to work shop will supply new starting
points for discouraged students. They
may have been unsuccessful in their
last term in college andhave seen but
li'ttle use ,, for certain. subjects they?
were studying, and have had their

, views materially al'tered in their shop

practice. _

(h) They will have opportunity to
study manufacturing or operating or-
ganizations in their dealings with
their employees, in; their methods of
transmitting orders or ‘technical in-
formation, in their methods of keep-
ing records of their tools, materials
and ﬁnished product, in their method
of keeping the time of the men and
paying them according to the various

plans of payment in use.

They will come in direct "touch with
the workmen and get his point of view
of things. He will be in a much bet-
ter position to handle men‘ of that
kind later in life, from a ‘knowledge
of the workman’s idea of his duty to
his employer, etc.

(i) He willstudy ‘the regular man-

_ufacturing,operations such as various

kinds of standard machining; meth--
ods of handling tools’, materials, parts
of machines, etc.; the types of labor
saving devices; methods of increas-
ing production; of testing the com-
pleted apparatus and of preparing it
for_ shipment.

He will do all of ‘this not at the sug-
gestion of an instructor who will as-
sign these topics as regula_r duties,
nor will he be afforded special facili-
ties for investigating these points, but
in the regular performance of his as-
signed duties and keeping his eyes
open to what is around him. His in-
structors will undoubtedly ask him
how the ﬁrm for whom he is now
working, accomplish certain things
and if he has not already noticed, this
suggestion will cause him to do so.

(j) He will make acquaintance and
form friendships that will later betof
value to him in securing positions, in
getting advice, etc. ‘

George Ade has expressed very ter-
sely a good recipe for making ac--
quaintances: “Make an effort to meet

‘the’ ‘big ones"and allow the ‘little

ones’ to meet you.”

He will have aichance to make :1
record all the time. They .do not'ap-
preciate the fact that their fellows are
putting a valuation upon them just
as they have found opinions of all of
their associates. They are expecting

some time, after they get out of col--

lege perhaps, to start and ‘make a
wonderful record. The co—operative
plan will tend to cause them to make
an earlier start upon their good re-
solve.

(k) Familiarity with actual engi-
neeringfconditions will give the stu-
dent conﬁdence and a broader view
of things.
tion to get more information from
his instructors. Heiwill enter into
more class discussions and tend to
give more life to all of‘his ‘college
work. ’

He will ‘be in better position to
judge of t-he efﬁciencygand scope of
his college course_,and to make sug-
gestions for modiﬁcations and im-
provements. V s

(1) The question of pay, while gen-
erally a most important item, is in this
case of secondary importance. The
cash receip'ts will be small, probably
but little more than enough to keep
one in reasonable comfort.

There will be but a very meager
knowledge of banking gained by ‘act-
ual experience during this period.’

(m) The-Students will acquire cer-
tain confidence in their ability to do
things. They will feel a certain in-
dependence as wage earners, and they
will form certain regular habits of
study and work, that they will accom-
plish much more in a givenvtime with
anything they attempt. _ ‘

He will be in a be'tter posi- '

BUILDINGS BEAUTIFIED.

The aes'thetic ideals of the trustees
of the University seem to be in good

recent improvements in the appear-
ance of two of our buildings.‘ _The
bricks in State Hall are beingcleaned
and the School of Education has been
painted. The decorative scheme used
on the School of Education, is a par-
ticularly happy choice, as that de-
partment has been mad.e to look like
a strenuous rival of the little red
school—h_ouse of our fore—fathers. All
it ‘needs is a bell to be complete.‘

the term “alma mater,” which is uni-
versally applied to colleges and uni-
versities where men receive their
scholastic training, is of purely Cath-
olic origin. It had’ its source‘ at the
University of.Bonn, and drew" its in-
spiration from the beautifull-v chis-

eled sta.tue of the mother of Christ——-.

known as the Alma Mater--placed
over the principal portal of that cele-
brated seat of learning.

STATE COLLEGE BULLETIN.

The Commencement Bulletin of

the Pennsylvania State College just

received contains some notable‘ ad-
dresses. One is by Dr. S. F. \/Veber
of Louisiana on “The Function of the
American High School” and another
on “Know Your Position,” by John
H. Jones of Pittsburgh. The presi-
dent's statement shows remarkable
growth in the number of students and
the unusual work this institution is
doing through its agricultural trains,
its mining institutes and its appren-
tice schools in various cities.

The annual game between VVest-
minster and Alleghenv colleges to be
played here November. 8, has been
cancelled by the latter. Allegheny

move will probably sever relations
between the two institutions in every
branch of athletics.
