Area Artist Group
Honors Art Prof
With First in Craft

By TESS KLEIN

The word bowl, at one time
or another, connotes edibles
to most of us: a bowl of cereal,
a bowl of soup. But more vital
than victuals, the real essence
of bowl to Virgil Cantini is
achievement -— be it in athletic
or aesthetic skills.

Mr. Virgil D. Cantini, Assistant
Professor of Fine Arts, continued
winning the esteem of the Pitt
faculty and student body alike,
when he added glory to our uni-
versity by winning ﬁrst prize for
the most creative work in crafts
in the Associated Artists of Pitts-
burgh (AAP) Exhibition.

He is a Pittsburgher (though
not by birth, having come to this
country at the age of eleven from
Italy) probably because he
turned down a football scholar-
ship to Notre Dame because that
school at the time did not offer
the most advanced courses in art
/ -—and art even then was his prime
interest.

     

Chose Tech
He chose Carnegie Tech, with-
out a football scholarship, but with
greater opportunity for an aspir-
ing artist.
Mr. Cantini did play football
--until he suffered a serious
cervical injury in one of the
games-—but he played for love
of the sport rather than pay.
During the four years he was
earning his bachelor’s degree at
Tech and the year he spent on

  

was interrupted by two and a half
years of military service), Mr.
Cantini earned the money for his

— tuition by working in a steel mill
during vacations. ‘

Worked For Smith

He later performed paid tasks
around the studio of Professor
Frederick Clayton, one of the most
accomplished silversmiths in the
country. And it was here that he
realized his special interest in en-
amel on metal.

Graduate work at Alfred Uni-
versity, Cleveland Institute of
Art, and Skowegan School of
Art is but part of Mr. Cantini’s
educational background with
the purpose of higher learning
in creative enamels.

V i r g i 1 Cantini’s prominence

-among artisan groups in Pitts-
burgh is evident as it is noted
that he was selected as one of
 seven Pittsburghers among 32 art-
. ’ ists and educators who recently
 judged the National Scholastic
Art Exhibition.

Won Religion Prize
He is Vice-President of the
AAP, ,a member of the Crafts-
men’s Guild, recently winning ﬁrst
prize for any media dealing with
religious subjects, in this group’s
exhibition at the Arts and Crafts
Center.
His AAP winning entry and
others are currently on exhibit at
the Downtown Y.W.C.A.
ButNotre Dame has called on
Virgil Cantini once again — al-
though this time, not so much
for a Bowl game, ‘but ironically,

More ground will ‘have to be

held by the American Craftsmen’s
Council beckons him to Asilomar,
California, where he will be a
panel participant in the Enamels
and Glass discussions and demon-
strations.

Miles Added

The announcement of the Gug-
genheim Fellowship award, (see
page 1) naturally will mean add-
ed miles towards achievement for
Virgil Cantini —- literally and
ﬁguratively speaking.

Speaking of his goal in life,
Mr. Cantini said, “I have reach-
ed the point where it is essen-
tial to study in the workshops
of Europe, Vienna, Bruges, Li-
moges, and others, where great

CARVING--Virgil D. Canitini, with mallet, is shown in the studio

at the University has recently been awarded a Guggenheim Fel-
lowship for “unusual and proven creative ability in ﬁne arts.”

Modern art is passing through

more than the ordinary period of
adjustment between decorative
aspects and significant content. I

contribution to the art of Amer-
ica.”

Goal In Sight

Now that he has the opportunity
to reach his goal, “to work out
with zest, the creative and aesthe-
tic aspiration combined with the
accumulated technical knowledge

tini should no more question the
wisdom of his decision which took
him away from one love: the grid-
iron, but found even greater glory
in another: galleries.

entry in the AAP exhibit, entitled
“The Sun,” was—-a bowl.

Odds and Ends

By Ed Bachman

Random thoughts on a hot spring afternoon 

I wonder why the City Fathers are over—look-
ing a splendid aid to the terrible parking problem
in the Oakland area. While in Detroit last week,
I saw an amazing sight: that city’s Pontiac Park,
a beautiful stretch of land in the very heart of
the shopping and civic district, is literally being
“face-lifted.”

The entire park, including
fountains, statues, sidewalks,
etc., has been taken up and put
aside for awhile. Now they are
digging under for a mammoth
under-ground parking garage.
When the garage is completed,
the park will be set in place ex-
actly as before. Why can’t some-
thing like that be done here,
particularly under the Schenley Plaza?

Why All The Noise?

Nobody yet has shown me the practibility of
having our two R.O.T.C. departments doing their

drilling right under the nose of the Cathedral. The

military powers-that-be obviously are unaware that
valuable class time is continually being inter-
rupted with the noises of calling cadance, blowing
bugles, beating drums, etc., adding to the frustra-
tion of harried instructors who are unable to hold
their class’ hearing or attention.

‘Why can’t this drilling be done on the Forbes

 

 

John Michelson must have slept a little uneasy
the night he found out that Oklahoma's varsity
whipped their own alumni team earlier this month
in their annual football enxhibition. It was the
first time in years that the alumni have been turn-
ed back, and this strongly hints that the Sooners
will be top contenders to win a third national title
in a row, come this autumn. Pitt, in September,
will probably be heavy underdogs when Bud Wil-
kinson attempts to win his 41st straight.

Let's Get Arena Started

Again, we have a question directed at the City
Fathers. What is the run—around ‘on the long-await-
ed Municipal Auditorium‘? Pittsburgh’s widely-
publicized and eagerly anticipated Bi-centennial,
which will start on Thanksgiving Day of 1958,
will be tremendously lacking without the use of.
the auditorium. ‘

The latest target date is now said to be 1961
before the arena will be completed. Many special
events which are desired for the 14-month dura-
tion of the Bi-centennial will have to be put off
then, for lack of facilities. When the ideawas first
proposed two years ago, it was promised that the
city arena would be completed in plenty of time
for the big celebration, but the City Council, County
Commissioners and others have wasted so much
time arguing over such things as a ~movable top '
that the ground-digging just keeps being put of!
again and again. And meanwhile the city is being
deprived of big league hockey and basketball,

Spring is finally here and the usual epidemic of spring
fever is showing up in absences from classes. "Almost as a
favor to those who are suffering from the listlessness, many
classes have been dismissed during the comingmonth of
May.

Classes have been dismissed for the Chancellor’s Inaug-
uration, Carnival, _Tap Day, and Scholars’ Day. These are
special events in the University calendar. They _are planned
for student participation therefore the dismissal of classes. It
is not meant as a gift of free time for doing homework which
should have been done at other times or worse, for wasting
time in the Tuck Shops, Commons Room or other haunts on
and off the campus.

Those who are looking on those free hours as time for

long—neglected assignments are just as far off base as those
who plan a few hours of leisure. For the most part the
excuse of putting the time to good use in writing or reading
is just that———an excuse and a poor one at that. There is
time for assignments in the day of a good student because
he finds time. Good students will not need those hours,
which have been dismissed, for the doing of homework.
Only a poor student must wait for time to be given to him
free, in order to do his duty as a student.

Therefore the duty of all good students will be to the
student—interest atcivities- planned for those free hours. The
programs are designed for students and considerable time
and expense, mostly on the part of fellow students, is con-
sumed in the arranging of these activities. The time is wast-
ed if not used for the purpose for which it was given.

A Capital Idea . . .

Life or Death ?

By Millard Amdur

If some one were to tell you
that the average time served by
a man convicted of murder is
seven years, you’d probably
laugh at him. This, however, is
an unfortunate
truth. Today
conviction on a

  
   
    

Univer s i t y
students, a ll ’
very close to
the age of responsibility should
be aware of the problems in-
herent to our genal code. Most
states in our country, including
Pennsylvania, have capital pun-
ishment as one of the options of
judge and jury for conviction on
a charge of murder in the ﬁrst
degree.

Yet recently a criminal court
justice has stated with statistical
evidence in support of his con-
tention that the chances of a
murderer failing to pay the su-
preme penalty for his crime is
120-1. It has long been a mat-
ter of argument as to whether
or "not this procedure can be
justiﬁed by the state.

The rather abstract points of
“justice,” biblical authority for
and against, capital“ punishment,
the humanity or inhumanity in-
herent to the system, may be
argued on both. sides. These
issues seem of little consequence
in comparison with the three
basic issues presented by George
Ryley‘ Scott in his “History of
Capital Punishment.”

Prevent Murder

These are deterrence, preven-
tion, and irrevocability. If cap-
ital punishment can be said to
prevent murder to an extent
which nothing else_ can do, it
may certainly be justiﬁed. Let’s
consider the ﬁrst major issue,
prevention ‘of murder by the
fear inspired through the sev-
erity of the possible penalty.

Do people fear death? Yes,
they do if the death is imminent.
But just as most human beings
consider rarely the ever-present
possibility of death, the murder-
er, too, doesn’t fear death, until
it is certain it will result. Even
the soldier on the ﬁeld of battle

often has in the back of his mind
that “it’ll be the other guy who
is killed.” This sublime unreal-
istic attitude is invaluable at
times, but in conjunction with
the next consideration indicates
that capital punishment does
little or nothing to deter others
from committing murder.

There are two basic types of
murderers, premeditated and
unpremeditated. The individual
committing a murder well—p1an-
ned in advance believes that he
is involved‘ in the “perfect
crime,”’ and, thus, is not con-
cerned with the death penalty.
With- the same conclusion, the
person who murders on snap re-
action has no time to consider
the consequences. So, again it
seems that capital punishment is
of little use in the deterrence of
the “potential murderer.”

Second Objective

As to the second objective,
that of preventing the murderer
from further violent acts, statis-
tics indicate that the chances of
the released murderers, commit-
ting another murder are almost
nil. The state must believe that
capital punishment is not neces-
sary to protect its citizens for it
does not deem it necessary to
execute a homicidal maniac -
The emotionally unstable person
is far more likely to repeat his

act. No incentive is pre-requis-
ite.

On the other hand, although
the state is not concerned with
retribution particularly, seven
years seems a short periodof
time for the murderer guilty of
extraordinary brutality or the

like. Some change from the pre-‘

sent “life imprisonment” sen-
tence seems in order, since it’s
now life imprisonment in name
only. V

The third and most potent is-
sue to those interested in the
abolition of capital punishment
is the irre-vocability of death. It
may be said that a person today
is executed only when it is be-
yond the shadow of a doubt that
he is guilty. The fact remains
that numerous mistakes have
been made.

There may be persons guilty
of criminal acts which deserve
the death penalty. In some cases,
guilt will be provable. ‘In other
cases, evidence may be purely
circumstantial. To retain the
death penalty, while attempting
to ensure that no person pos-
sibly innocent.’ would be ex-
ecuted, means limiting the death
penalty to such an extent that it
would be inoperative (as it al-
most is now). At the same time,
any deterrent effect it is pur-
posted to have is reduced to
nothingness.

Letters to the Editor I‘

Editor, Pitt News
As editor of the paper, it must
be obvious to you and everyone

else, that the time of year has
arrived when the various cliq-
ues are struggling for power.
With the exception of the News
and a few other organizations
of outstanding merit, most
campus organizations do noth-
ing to serve the students. In a
“streetcar school” like Pitt
where there is not a close rela-
tionship. between student and
faculty, it should be a vital
function of these campus or-
ganizations to bring about a
closer relationship.

It seems obvious to many of us,
that many campus organizations
exist only for their own mem-
bers and use some watered-
down reason to pretend that
they serve the students! Ask any

student not a member of these
campus cliques who the officers
are of these supposedly student
government organizations, a nd
they cannot tell you.

_Under our outstanding new
Chancellor, who is trying ~ to
bring the faculty and students
closer together, it may be pos-
sible for these organizations to
make some effort to justify their
being. Thus far they have fail-
ed. These organizations are al-
right in a small town college
where the students are close to-
gether.

No more of this government of
the clique, by the clique, for
clique. _It is rather for us , the
students of Pitt, to insure that
these organizations who have‘
thus far so nobly failed,.be dedi-
cated to this unﬁnished work.

Freshman Learns
American Customs
Of Speech, Sports
By ELIZABETH ZVOLERIN
Going to college in the Unit-
ed States is an ordinary ex-
perience for American stu-
dents, but to Solomon Nasser

of Kafarran, Tel-Kalkh, Sy-

ria, it is a dream that has ma-
terialized.

“I thought about it and talked
about it, but I didn't believe any-
thing would coine of it. I learned
of the University of Pittsburgh
through relatives who are living
in New Kensington. They were
visiting my family in Syria and
convinced me that I should come.
I am very happy they encouraged
me.”

Now a second semester fresh-
man studying mechanical en-
gineering, Solomon was employ-
ed as an accountant with the
Syrian Ministry of Defense in
Damascus when he applied for
admission to Pitt and was ac-
cepted.

“I landed in New York last
August and was alarmed to ﬁnd
that I couldn’t understand the
language. I had studied English
for three years in Syria, but I
found that I didn’t know a plus
from a minus. I began to wonder
whether I had been studying Ger-
man instead of English. It was
because I didn’t have enough con-
versational experience. But I am
learning.”

And learning he is, even though
he still has difficulty (as do many
Americans) with the SlXty-fOUl'-
dollar words.

A ﬁne specimen of Syrian
manhood, 22-year-old Solomon
Nasser stands six feet tall, has
brown eyes, brown wavy hair,
an engaging smile and the poise
of the continental. He speaks
carefully, but easily, with a
slight European accent and

dresses in the American fashion.

A true diplomat, Sol (as his
school friends call him) claims
that American and Syrian women
are the same: “There is no differ-
ence between American and Syr-
ian women. In fact, there is little
difference between American and
Syrian people, except that Amer-
ican people are not quite as seri-
ous as the Syrian people. You
know, they joke more.”

American witticisms and casual
speech still bewilder Sol at times.
“It is difficult sometimes to un-
derstand if people are being seri-
ous-or being funny. Then they

laugh, and I know it is a joke.”

His interests are very similar
to American college men. An
avid sportsman, Sol swims,
plays soccer, basketball, squash
and rides. And like most Amer-
icans, he’s crazy about baseball.

Besides being a sport’s enthus-
iast, Sol likes to sing and dance,
especially Latin dances — mambo,
rhumba, samba and tango

Though he has been in this
country for less than a year, Sol
has become almost completely
Americanized, without losing his
Old World charm and manners.

(I just couldn’t! Dinner was Ralph.)

$0.50 —— sorority ﬁne for dating undesirable boy. (Rod-

Why else would he go steady with eight girls?)

$0.26 — pack of Philip Morris. What joy! What zest!

WEDNESDAY:
$557.38 - a motorcycle for Roderigo. (He is giving up all
his other girls for me, but they are so widely
scattered that he needs a fast conveyance to go
around and tell them all goodbye.)
$0.26——pack of Philip Morris. (Have you tried them
yet? If not, you’ve got a big treat coming. Light

FRIDAY:

$0.26-pack of Philip Morris—a happy smoke for a
happy day. Yesterday Roderigo broke with the
last of his girls, and today he is mine, all mine!

$8.57 —new dogﬁsh for zoology. (I was dissecting a
dogﬁsh in zoology when I happened to look out the
window and see Roderigo riding by with Mary
Ann Beasley on his buddy seat. I got so upset I
threw the dogﬁsh at them.) “

SATURDAY:

$2.59 - a carton of Philip Morris, one pack for me, the
rest for Roderigo. (I was foolish to be angry about
Mary Ann. Roderigo explained that she meant
nothing to him-just helping him with English lit.
Similarly, Grace Krovney is helping him with
Spanish, Betsy Pike with econ, Mazda Notkin with
psych, Lola Tweet with phys ed, etc, The least he
can do is give them all Philip Morrises.)

End,Tackle Strength

Worries Michelosen

By MURRAY CI-IASS
For a coach who must contend with such national pow-
ers as Oklahoma and Miami and who has a two year bowl tra-
dition to uphold, Johnny Michelosen deserves better fortune

-at the endand tackle positions that it seems he will have for

the 1957 football season.

When Spring practice began on March 19, the Panthers
were minus four of their ﬁve top ends from last year and the two
top tackles. This left a total of three lettermen for the two positions.

Michelosen’s lone exprienced end is Dick Scherer. a senior
from North Catholic. Scherer, who will start on the left side
of the line, was used as the replacement for both Joe Walton
and Bob Rosborough. Scherer has already proved himself to be
a capable pass receiver, and Michelosen feels that the 6 foot,
2 inch, 205-pound terminal has improved his offensive blocking.

Jim Zanos, a converted fullback, will probably be the other
wingrnan. The Munhall product came to the Jungle Cats as a line-
bucker, but during last year’s Spring drills, he was brought up to
the line.

The head coach describes “Bo” as a boy with a good pair of
hands. He is also considered a rough defensive player.

Another convert, Art Gob, could give Zanos a fight for the
right end post. Gob originally was an end, but when a shortage of
tackles arose last year he was changed over to 
that position. And now the lack_of ends has en-
abled him to switch once again. Gob is especially
good on snagging hook passes. .

Other end candidates are Ray Carion, Paul
Stolitsa, Joe Pullekines, and Bob Rathi. The
first two are both transfer students, Carion from
Maryland and Stolitsa from Waynesburg.

Pullekines is also among those players who
started out at one position and wound up at an-
other. Last year he was a tackle. Rathi is a s0pho-   »
more from Munhall. '55“

Michelosen admits that his big worry is the ends. "‘End is the
dark spot,” he says. “The boys will have to come through in order
for us to be strong.”

The Panther mentor feels somewhat the same way about
the tackle spot. “We certainly won’t have the experience we
had last year. Then we had more experienced depth,” he states.

Nevertheless, huge Jim McCusker and Ron Kissel will be knock-
ing down opposing linemen without too much difficulty this fall. Both
are lettermen and should prove to be capable replacements for de-
parting Bob Pollock and Herm Canil.

McCusker, the 245—pounder who doesn’t weigh 245 pounds, is
one of the co-captains of the 1957 Cats. Although he is listed
at the weight just mentioned, scale-watchers seem to disagree.
They say that big Jim was caught at 257 during the recent

The Panthers had taken a 3-0
lead in the ﬁrst frame on a walk,
a single, another pass, ‘a two-
base blow by leftfielder Hoover,
and a bingle by Bonacci.

The Bearcats got their first tally
in the second inning and then
scored one in the fourth, a pair
in the sixth, and their final one
in the seventh.

The Jungle Cats dropped the

ﬁrst of their weekend tussles Fri-

day to Cornell, 6-3, in a game
shortened to eight innings by
darkness. Cornell jumped off to a
2-0 lead in the first inning and
the Panthers tied it up with two
in the third. Mike Tuchak, who
was playing at ﬁrst, started it off
with a walk and DeLost singled
him to second.

Moog, who started on the
mound, sacriﬁced the runners to
second and third. From there
Tuchak scored on Jaxe1’s fly and
DeLost came across on a wild
pitch. Their other run came in
the sixth on Cost’s triple and a
wild pitch. Cornell won the game
with single tallies in the ﬁfth,
sixth and a pair in the seventh.

Dunlap has had twelve hits in 33
times at bat for a .363 average.
The only other Panther over .300
is Corky Cost, the second base-
man, who is currently batting at
a .333 clip.

College Boxing  
i Appears Doomed

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

V The sport that decides who‘ is the better man once the
opening bell ihas sounded-—boxing-—-is slowly dying out and
‘ appears headed for oblivion in the collegiate ranks. Boxing,
as a college attraction, appears to be biding its time until
the few schools that do ﬁeld teams 'will be compelled to drop

- the sport on an intercollegiate level -because of scheduling
» dﬂiculties.
The 20th annual National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
‘ tourney held at Pocatello, Idaho, several weeks ago drew entries from
only 13 schools in the 48 states, with most of the schoolslérepre-sented
being concentrated in the Far Western states.

Coach Milton (Dubby) Holt’s Idaho State team captured the
team title with 59 points while runner-up Washington State could
score only twelve points. Idaho State won seven of the ten in-
dividual championships, too, as they lost only twogbouts in three

_ days to set records for the number ‘of team points and the number

of individual titles won.

College boxing was a fast-growing sport during the late 1930’s
and seemedeto be gaining a ﬁrm foothold as a major athletic spectacle
at many colleges. Pitt ﬁelded a team before the Second World War
forced them to give up as it did many other schools. When the war
was over, a large number of these schools that previously supported
teams did not revive the sport. This was the ﬁrst setback which
started boxingeon the downgrade.

Those that did revive the combat sport’ were content to have it
only on an intramural basis, thus casting aside any hope for it to
expand. Professional boxing, aided by extensive radio andltelevision
coverage, quashedthe remaining hope of amateurlboxing devotees for
its growth during the late '1940’s and early 1950’s. _

Currently, in the East, there are no institutions that have

a team. The last two Eastern schools to give up boxing in inter-
collegiate circles were Syracuse and Penn State. The major
reasons given was the usual lack of fan interest and extreme
scheduling problems caused by great travel. In order to get a
‘ suitable opponent, Pennstate and Syracuse would have to travel
to the Midwest where they could match ring skills with Wisconsin,
the deep South where they could play Louisiana State, or the

Far West which eliminated itself because of exorbitant traveling
costs.

 

 

Southern’ foes were stopped from competing with the Northern
and Western schools because of le

tegrated athletic events.

Thus boxing had only one way to go, and its course was guided
by a combination of uncontrollable factors. When the small ﬁght
clubs that supply the professional game with talent also began to
gradually disappear, amateur boxing was in almost as lamentable
a position as college boxing. The pros collect all of their potential
stars from the colleges and the amateur ranks, but the dwindling sup-
ply of talent had little impact on their doing anythinglto help college
and amateur boxing regain its previous status. In the long run it would
be beneﬁcial to the big ﬁghting stables to encourage boxing, but they

gislative action prohibiting in-

apparently are more concerned about the short run.

Despite this gloomy picture there is still
that college boxing will return,
time to stabilize its position with

M a slim possibility
though it may take a long

other sports. At the conclu- .

sion of the recent NCAA classic, the ruling committee added a

will stimulate I wider
and participation by students
and those considering adding
boxing to their athletic pro-
gram. The NCAA also appointed
a committee to work on a year-
round plan to encourage the
adoption of the sport by the
hesitant coleges.
It would be nice to see a couple
of college pugilists slugging with

_ their hearts as well as their ﬁsts

in proud defense of school colors
again. It happened before, maybe

- it can happen again..

 

Robson Named

Swim Captain

Ed Robson, senior breaststroker,
has been elected captain of the
1958 Panther swimming team.

Next year will mark Robson’s
third year as a member of the
varsity. The senior steady came

Ronnie Schwarzel, ex-Brent-

by a 6 and 5 score.

The Blue and Go1d’s Bob White

much better agility this year. ” .‘

His running mate, Kissel, ap-
pears ready for a big year. ‘A
senior from nearby McKeesport,
he stands 6 feet, 2 inches, and
weighs 230 pounds. ‘According to
Michelosen, Kissel is improved
somewhat defensively and has
good speed.

Behind these two bruisers are

a number of tackle hopefuls, none '

of whom can be considered strong
enough replacements for the ﬁrst
stringers. Ernie Westwood is up
from the freshman squad, but lack
of experience will dampen his
chances. The same holds true for
Larry Burke.

-Ed Humeston, at 200 pounds, is
described as a lineman with “a
lot -of quickness which could be
used to good advantage,” while
Tom Romanik, who goes at 5 feet,
10 inches and 225 pounds, is
“strong like a little sparkplug.”

Bill Lindner, a junior, and

Jim Sabatini, a converted cen-

ter, are other tackles who may

see some action.

Thrash

Once upon a time, when the
world was really evil, and a
thief lurked behind every bush,
cautious men had their shirts
painted on! The reason for this
is explained by a perceptive
saying of those days:
“Forsooth, nothing deters
those rapscallions about town.
Theg/’ll steal anything that
isn’t buttoned down.“
Rough days — particularly
for the shirt business, what
with painters picking up all
the proﬁts. Until, suddenly,
an idea of genius appeared.
The button-down shirt! This
‘ shirt was actually buttoned on
‘ to the chest of the wearer, making
it absolutely steal-proof!

 

Today,-in these honest times, _
we still feel its inﬂuence. It is

the -answer and the proof on
the line!

First, Chevrolet won the Auto
Decathlon over every car in its
ﬁeld, and over the higher priced
cars that were tested, too. This
rugged ten-way test (right, below)
showed Chevrolet was the champ
in handling ease, braking, acceler-

ness of ride and other driving
qualities you want in a car.
Then, Chevy won the Pure
Oil Performance Trophy at
Daytona (left, below) as “best

It’s quite a feeling to know
that you are driving a car that
performs so well, responds so
beautifully and is so ﬁnely built.
You feel proud, of course. But
you also enjoy a surer, smoother,
steadier way of going, a keen
