Bolkovac Forecasts
Own Touchdown

There was one person, in Pitt Stadium to whom Nick Bol-
koVac’s touchdown run was no Surprise. That Person was Nick
Bolkovac. '

“You Won’t believe this,’ said Nick after the game, “but
yesterday before practice I told Dick Cassiano that I was going
to Score a touchdown in that game. And I had never scored one I _  . __,
before in all my high school and college games. GOAL POSTS taen from Pitt Stadium after Saturda victory were paraed -

No MORE ‘upsets’

hooking back over the season with the noise from Satur-
day ’s “upset” still ringing in our ears, we see that the Pan-
thers scored three “upsets,” beatting Indiana, Purdue and Penn
State when the experts said it couldn’t be done.

Our question is this: Can a team score three upsets? And
still call those three “upsets”? After all, there is—a point
where upsets end. and deserved victories begin.

When a team pulls three “upsets” in its last ﬁve games
and ends up with a season record of six wins and three losses,

country, then that team’s ability must be reevaluated.
z Pitt-deserves some reevaluation. ,

 ,One thing is clear as the Panthers ring down the curtain
on their best season in ten years. And that is that Pitt this
year did not have a mediocre team. On the other hand, it did
not have a top team.

But it had a damn good team.

, Credit for this is due to Head Coach Mike Milligan, his
-corps of assistants, and most of a1l.to the team itself.

.As one out-of-town sports writer led oﬁ his story on
:Saturday’s victory (not upset): “Once mighty‘ Pitt is mighty
again.” «

]It’s a nice feeling.

And just wait until next year!

SAY THANK YOU '

. If a holiday ever had anything to say about the month in
which it occurred, Thanksgiving might well just nod its feathery
head and say, ‘This is as it should be.’ _'

In Pitt circles, at least, Tliaiiksgiving could not have been

top theround of grid victories and the equally substantial round
of contributions to the building fund, the Pitt family can well
. aﬁord time to say ‘thanks.’

. And ttoinorrow afternoon at one, the Pitt family is invited
to gather and say the most ﬁtting kind of thanks. Heinz Chapel
is large enough to accomodate a great many students and the
Thanksgiving Service fails if it is carried on in an atmosphere
of empty pews.

Thanksgiving Chapel Service is scheduled to last for one
half hour, between one and one-thirty Wednesday afternoon.
 short thanks, and most of us can ﬁnd time to say it.

Their Tops at
Giant Rally

(Continued from Page 1)

Had it not been for the rain
the demonstration might easily
been been the biggest thing Oak-
land has seen over ten years.

As it was, most of the Celebrat-
ing was ﬁnished by noon and al-
most all Pitt students returned to
classes at 12:30. Classes were of-
ﬁcially canceled from 9:30 until
12:30.

It was pure bedlam at Pitt’s ral-
ly in Soldiers and Sailors Hall.

Hall Overﬁowing
By 9:30 the mammoth hall was
overﬂowing with thousands of
students. Entrance of the band
was the signal for the almost-

gin. After cheers and the Pitt
Medley played by the band it was
‘Mike Mil1igan’s turn to shine.

Speaking emotionlesslv, Mike
lauded both Pitt and Penn State,
the support of the student body,
and his assistants on the coach-
ing staﬁ.

While this was going on, mem-
bers of Pitt’s Panthers were slow-
ly dribbling up on the stage to
receive the acclamation of the
roaring crowd. First came Mike
Boldin, Ralph Coleman, Bob
Plotz, then Bob Becker, Don Fish-
er, Pete Fuderich, Ted Geremsky,
Bernie Barkouskie, Len Radnor,
Joe Cherol, Bob Mihm, and oth-
'ers.

, Players Bandaged

Some, like Fuderich and Fish-
. er, were almost unrecognizable be-
hind bandages. All were greeted
with wild roars. -

It remainedifor Chancellor Ru-
fus Fitzgerald to steal the show.
Gripping the rostrum and bobbing
up and down, he recalled the Pur-
due victory and then brought the
crowd to its feet with a shouting
reenactment of Nick Bo1kovac’s
game-winning pass. interception.
The Chancellor ended up with a
dramatic: “The University is mov-
ing forward on all fronts.”

_The rally lacked only one thing
--Nick Bolkovac. The hero of Sat-
urday’s game was nowhere to be
found.

Mayor S-peaks

Mayor David Lawrence was next
to speak and was greeted with
shouts of ((Bolkovac for Mayor.”
“I’m glad this isn’t election year
or I would‘ be running against
Bo1kovac,” the Mayor laughingly
ad libbed.

Then he struck his serious note:
“I’m sick and tired of hearing of
Pittsburgh football players toss-
ing passes and making end runs
against a University of Pitts-
burgh team.”

When the mayor had ﬁnished,

High as Skibos
Celebrate Win

Tech ’s victory rally yester-
«day began slowly with a few
cheers in the Skibo, the campus
‘cafeteria, and snowballed out

- front to the Fine Arts building
as students and the Kiltie band
assembled.

Rain, which dampened the cam-
pus, failed to dampen Tech’s long
awaited victory celebration as the
‘plaid-skirted cheerleaders led the
crowd in ‘Hold them team’ and
‘Carnegie Institute of Tech-no-

-.logy.’

The cheering students, equipped

with everything from the yard-
1 line markers to the Grove City
, highway sign, parted ranks as the
M Kilties swung through to start the

rally- Introduces Team
Grid Captain Jerry Myers called
1 the rest of the team up to receive
' their “15 rahs” after he said hap-
 pily‘ “We’ve been waiting two
1 years for this!” . .
 - After the weird wail of a bag-
i pipe number the crowd called for
‘ Athletic Director Clarence “Bud-
i dy” Overend and Coach Bill Don-
l ohue. '
i Co_ach Donohue smiled as he
‘ said:
, “It’s the first Monday morning
smilein three years. . . . This is
the start. of a 20-game winning
streak.” ‘

Tech’s basketball schedule was
read to the accompaniment of crys
of “on to Pitt” and the booming
of ﬁreworks set on the campus.

Tech Made Noise
Since the purpose of the rally
j was to “Make enough noise so all
.«Pittsburgh will know Tech won,”
J the Techites then stormed across
their campus and across Panther
Hollow bridge, across Forbes and
up Bigelow Boulevard to join the
cheering Pitts at Soldiers’ and

Sailors’ memorial. ,
The Tech rooters and Kiltie
hand then stormed and jammed
the entrance to the hall as they
limpatiently waited for the Pitt
crowd to emerge and join them in

a march on Flagstaff Hill.

KILTIE BAND band members from Tech marched from their

own campus to Pitt’s celebration, then_led the Pitt Band back to

Flagstaff Hill for more cheering.

Americans. .

Bolkovac had sprained his ankle
‘in the second quarter but was still
probably the fastest and best line-
man on the ﬁeld. He led a Pitt line
that was outplayed most of the
game but never outplayed in the
pinches. ’

« Even under a steady rain, the
crowd stayed on Flagstaff Hill for
over an hour, listening to speak-
ers praise the spirit of friendliness
(at least for the time being) be-
tween the two schools.

The famed Tech bagpipers, shiv-
ering in their kilts, accompanied
their pipe master as he did a
dance. Not to be ‘outdone, the Pitt
swing band played a’ specialty
while drum major Bill DeLuca
jitterbugged.

Rain Hastens End

After more rain, cheers and mu-
sic, the demonstration broke up,
Pitt’s band and students returning
to "the Cathedral and the Kilties
returning to Tech. Some Tech
men, however, roamed for a while
through the Tuck shops in the Ca-
thedral, while others formed a car
caravan and paraded through the
Oakland district.

All in all, considering the rain,
it was quite a demonstration cele-
brating quite a victory.

‘Open House’ Tours.
Show OH University
To Interested Public

A “public open house” tour of the buildings on the Cathedral of
Learning campus Sunday Dec. 5 from three to six o’clock in the af-
ternoon was announced today by Chancellor R. H. Fitzgerald.

This will be the ﬁrst time since construction of the Cathedral

that it has been opened for public
visiting from sub-basement to the
thirty-sixth ﬂoor. All residents of
Pittsburgh and Western Pennsyl-
vania are invited. ‘

I Faculty members and students

will greet visitors and show them
the Cathedral of Lerning, Heinz
Memorial Chapel, and the Stephen
Collins Foster Memorial. Visitors
will be welcome to attend at the
same time the customary after-
noon Vesper service in the chapel,
which begins at four o’clock.

A similar program has been
arranged for a group of invited
guests Sunday, Nov. 28, 1948.

The “open house” tour has been
planned in answer to hundreds of
requests from people all over this
area who have asked to see “what
goes on in Pitt’s tall school-
house,” Dr. Fitzgerald said.

“The money to cnstruct these
buildings, which are among the
ﬁnest University buildings in the
world, was provided largely by

the people, corporations, and bus--

iness firms of‘ Pittsburgh and
Western Pennsylvania,” Dr. Fitz-
gerald said.

Fine Arts Gallery Displays Worki
Of Nineteenth Century Painter

By WILLIAM BREZGER

What is perhaps the most am-
bitious art exhibit ever assembled
at the University is now on dis-
play in the Fine Arts gallery.

It is a collection of the paint-

_ings,- water colors, and drawings

of Russell Smith, a nineteenth’
century painter.

The effect of viewing this ex-

hibit is not merely one of look- _

ing at pictures; it is also one of
looking at history. Smith lived
and painted in Pittsburgh. Many
of his earliest scenes are of Pitts-
burgh and Western Pennsylvania
in the 1830’s. Looking at these__
paintings today is the same as
turning back to great-great grand-
father’s time. The effect is_ start-

Art Lecture

Dr. John W. Oliver, head. of
the department of history, will
speak tonight at 8 p. m. at the
Open House being held in the
Fine Arts gallery in connection
with the showing of the paint-
ings of early Pittsburgh by Rus-
sell Smith. His topic will be
“An Awakening in Early Pitts-
burgh History.”

“A view of Pittsburgh from the
Salt Works on Saw Mill Run”
shows the Point as it Was in 1834.
There was no North Side in those
days, and Oakland .was just a
group of hills. Already the city
was smoky. The Blockhouse is
shown as it was when Isaac Craig

‘ lived in it. That was in 1832.

and a view “Looking up the River

To Plan Future

The Graduate Cap and.Gown
Society is holding a general meet:
ing next Monday, to formulate
plans for future activities of the
organization. _ I I’

William F. Saalbach,‘ graduate
manager of the club, said that ho
production has been scheduled,
this year due mainly to lack of
student interest in both participa-
tion and attendance- Last year’s
show, Mabe1’s Fabel, evidenced.
this as few students tried out far‘,
the show and attendance was so
poor the club took a loss of $700‘.

“Perhaps all—male variety shows ’

are passe and not what the stu,-,'-‘V

dents want,” Mr. Saalbach re-‘v
marked. If that is the case, he
intends suggesting a few possiblafr
remedies at the meeting Mondaygg
such as putting on a combined.
male and female musical or pre-jé;'
senting a revue in the form of 
series of skits contributed by‘ pari-5.
ticipating fraternities and sorori-;
ties. . .. -‘

Whatever is decided, Mr. Saal-_-’“
bach hopes to maintain the prelsg;

tige and tradition of the or‘ganiza¥'- .

tion that has entertained Pitt stu-
dents over the years in 36 produc-
tions.

_7§Phe Steelers can’t equal Pitt’s

Some four weeks ago at the victory rally Wlllcll followed
the Indiana game, us11ally—q11iet Leo Skladan_\', fou1'—year regu-

State game would result in more of same.

That Leo qualifies as a prophet needs no comment.

VVhen darkness encompassed Oakland Saturday, the most
memorable event, in Pitt Stadium 's 21-year-old history left. an
aura of unexpected accomplishment hovering over the moist, cleated

turf of the deserted bowl.

For a 7-0 game, the Panther victory had perhapsimore thrills

than any of the 27 previous Pitt

victories in the Penn State series.

From Larry Joe’s six—yard return of Nick Bolkovac’s kickoff at
2:01 to Fran Rogel‘s desperate but unavailing plunge at 4:32 p. m.,

Fan Pays $10;

Pins in Sewer

A man, either a rabid Pitt fan

or a disgruntled Penn State fol-
lower, found a novel way of
parting with a $10 bill after the
game Saturday.
A ‘ Coming down 'DeSota street,
he encountered ,a youngster
peddling an overstock of Penn
State buttons. The gentleman,
upon questioning the lad, found
he could buy the entire card of
pins for $10.

He then took the buttons,
card and all, and checked them
down the nearest sewer.

“It’s worth ten bucks to get
rid of those pins,” he shouted
triumphantly as he sauntered on
down the hill.

First Break to State

A high pass "from center mid-

the ball on Pitt’s 34, but Sk1a-

nor nailed Elwood

a n attempted
forward pass to
end the threat.

Center Don
Fisher, on the

of four inter-
ceptions on the
-Pitt 36 and
carried the ball,
loaf-of-bread fashion, back to

intercepted.

A Nittany penetration into Pitt
territory ended on the Pitt 36
again when Jimmy Joe Robinson
ran Petchell out of bounds for no
gain on last down. A bit later,
Jimmy Joe broke loose off right
end and sprinted 40 yards before
Triplett caught him on the State
24. The threat stopped there.

Rogel Stopped

in the third quarter, they drove
67«yards to the Pitt 16, where Ro-
gel was stopped short on last
down.

Shortly after the ﬁnal quarter
got underway, State’s third-down-
and-ﬁve pass was batted’ into the
air by Ralph Coleman on their
own 25, gathered in by Bolkovac
on the 23, and he drove over with
the aid of improvised but efficient
blocking.

The last, desperate, futile drive
by a great Penn State team/ was

stopped by a team that was great-
er.

Bolkovac and Jimmy Joe Rob-
inson played probably the best
games of their careers. Don Fish-
er, Bobby Lee, Carl DePasqua,
Mike Boldin, Bill McPeak and Leo
Skladany were all members of a
superlative cast in which each
singularly and all the team col-

  Fislier’is Spirit
Pushed Team
On to Success

One of the biggest roles in Pitt’s
1948 football success was played
by a center who was expected to
be a fourth stringer. He is Don

‘Fisher, the man who made the
Panthers ﬁght back when they felt
like giving up.

Although he started the season
as a lowly scrub, he was lucky
enough to get into the Notre Dame
opener. When coach Mike"~Mil1igan
saw how Fisher could perform in
a game, he immediately presented
him with the regular center berth.

Along with the snapper-back
job, Fisher took the position of
ﬁeld lecturer. .When opposing
teams would begin to roll through
the Pitts, the husky center would
shout them into a playing mood.

He would dare his teammates to
rise up and splatter the opponents.
And he would do a little splatter-
ing of his own, too. .

Every time the public address
announcer said, “The tackle was
made by Fisher,” a loud cheer
would go up from the stands.

The cheers came from Fisher’s
fraternity crowd, his personal
rooting section. Ordinarily, per-
sonal cheering sections are annoy-
ing and‘ somewhat ridiculous to
other spectators. But Fisher de-
served a special yell now and
then.

In the second quarter of the
Penn State game — his last col-
legiate performance —— Don came
off the ﬁeld with a completely
closed right eye and a smashed,
bloody nose. '

Three minutes later he was back
in the game. And with only partial
visibility, he played a bruising
brand of football through the sec-

ond, third, and fourth periods.

<3.

The mouse on his eye was a fat
one. But had it swelled to the size
of a balloon, it still could not have
been bigger than Fisher’s playing
heart.-—MYRON ‘KOPELMAN.

Student Mouths Eat
C-obs of Holiday Bird

By BILL

SCRIVO

If ﬁgures don’t lie Pitt students will create a sizeable dent in

the Thanksgiving turkey market.

Friend turkey should be very much against higher education,

for if each or Pitt's 19,500 stu-6
dents eats one-half pound of the
festive bird, 9,750 pounds of white
and dark meat will be consumed.

At the present market price of
85 cents for an eviscerated (fully-
dressed to you) pound of turkey,
the turkeys will cost an amazing
$8147.50. ‘

Standing head to tail, the birds,
at a length of about two feet each,
would make four ﬁles from goal
line to goal line at Pitt stadium,
and have enough left over for a
line 34 yards long.

To stuff this 9,750 pounds of
turkey, at two loaves of bread for
a l5—pound fowl, will require
1,300 loaves of bread.

If this bread were stacked end
on end beside the Cathedral, it
would tower 59 loaves above the
skyscraper.

a pie to each hungry student
mouth, we find that 4,875 of the
spicy pastries would travel from
oven to table.

This many pumpkin pies would
extend in single file about 1//4 of
a mile, or from the cathedral up
the hill to Trees’ gym.

As to the number of dishes to
be washed by Pitt students after
these mountainous servings, there
will be plenty. _

We wont even attempt to tabu-
