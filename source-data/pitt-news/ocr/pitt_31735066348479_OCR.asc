"69 Years Of Collegiate Journalism”

Qrbe iatttiﬁems

University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa. A C I

Vol. 69, No. 52

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
Ronald Ziegler, the White House
press secretary and political aide
under former president Richard

-' ';‘Nixon, cancelled his much pub-

licized national lecture tour Friday,
which included speaking engage-
ments at Pitt and many other
colleges across the country.
The announcement, in which
Ziegler cited “personal problems”
' as a factor, was reported by the
United Press International over the
weekend. It came only two days
after the Student Government
Board voted to support an
invitation which had been extended
to Ziegler by SG’s Programming
Committee.

David Lawrence Hall February 24
at 8:30. /
Nancy Baron, a member of the
Programming Committee, said
yesterday,_ the committee had
spoken to Ziegler’s New York
booking agent C. William Leigh

,§_\Friday, but he did not indicate the

lecture tour was going to be
cancelled. Efforts to reach Leigh
for comment last night were
unsuccessful. '
Wire service reports which quoted
a Michigan State University official
as saying Ziegler had cancelled an
appearance there, as well asithe
rest of his tour, added some
lectures might be rescheduled to

i_ pi‘-.‘.3e,gin in March.

Ziegler’s national tour, which was
to. begin February 19, first
attracted national attention when a
student government at Boston
University voted to withdraw an
invitation made to the former
presidential aide following protests
from the dean. of the Public
Communication School and several
students. They charged he should
not be allowed to profit from the
Watergate affair.

The incident focused attention on
Ziegler’s tour, and an ethical

Nixon’s former '_
spokesman was to lecture on “The
V Presidency and the Press,” in

debate followed in newspapers and
on college campuses on whether
Ziegler should be paid a large
sum--$2500--for lecturing, since his
appeal as a speaker stemmed from
his involvement in the Watergate
conspiracy. _

Pitt’s SG Programming Com-
mittee, after some students ob-
jected to the invitation, delayed
signing the contract with Ziegler’s
agent until the SG Board approved
the action at a meeting Wed-
nesday. After the 5-0 vote, the last
official action of the Furick

administration, the contract was
signed and sent to New York.

Some publications,‘ including the.
New York Times, have implied that
efforts to keep Ziegler off the
campuses were not only motivated
by desires to prohibit Ziegler from
earning a proﬁt, but also the wish
to censor a speaker who represents
unpopular ideas.

Although many colleges have
contracted Ziegler, and many
campuses were forums used ‘to.

"Live wire:Engineers Need Constructive Seminars

 

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

An undergraduate civil engineering student who chose to
remain anonymous informed the Livewire that he’s
“unfairly required” to attend a weekly no-credit seminar
which offers “no constructive beneﬁts but is required for
graduation . ’ ’

“The seminars,” he said, “are for guest speakers, but.

nine times out of ten they consist of reports on the Civils’
basketball team scores or information on where to sign up
for Ping Pong competition.”

H The student added he’d welcome the chance to hear good.
3,‘/guest speakers, but only rarely, he says, are they invited.

“It's not the seminars that I’m against,” he said, ~“but the
bad way they’re conducted.”

. Missing two or more of these seminars in a term results in
a student’s receipt of a “G” grade on his transcript--an
“incomplete” which must be made up on an arbitrary basis

before he.can graduate, and in effect, the seminars are a

r .1
--

g\‘4'..,,

   

  

mandatory requirement for all engineering students.

Other engineering students have agreed the weekly
gatherings usually aren’t informative and speakers’
material regularly lack sustenance. _

Said one student: .“The lecture material lacks academic
value. The speakers talk generally about future job
opportunities when we’re essentially interested in learning
something.” .

Graduate Co-ordinator for Civil Engineering, John R.
Smith has countered that the weekly seminars offer the
only opportunity for getting important information to all
the engineers.

“Each week,” he said, “The engineering students are
brought together in these sessions so they can be informed
as a group about affairs that concern them. There’s no
‘pressure or grade on performance, so I can't see why the
students would complain.’ '

_ Smith also told the Livewire that it was the engineering ,
' students themselves‘ who" “ch'osé t6 '

   

  
  

’.

 ha_:1a*uie"-~ weekly“ ’

   

seminars in an effort to provide extra information not found - I

in the classroom. . .
. “Student engineers voted on these arrangements,” he
said, “they made it mandatory for everyonein the program
to attend these seminars.” L

Smith maintained that since the students had originated ',
the weekly seminar program, it was up to them to change
it. ~
“If the students want to change their setup,” said Smith,
“they should come together as a group to the engineering
department and voice their opinion. P

Smith speculated that very few engineering students are
dissatisﬁed with the weekly seminar policy, but invited
comments from those who were unhappy with it.

So there it is. The Livewire encourages all’ engineering
students who are not pleased with their department’s
mandatory seminar policy to ‘register their complaints or

"criticisms with the departmenthead--otherwise the policy ' g

Mr. Kahn implies that the

Facts, .Mr. Kahn, we don’t make
decisions at 4 am in a smoke-filled
room behind a locked door. The
Programming Committee meets
every Tuesday and Thursday
evening at 7 in room 307 of the
Student Union. The meetings are
always open to the public. Every
day room 307 is open from noon
until 5 pm. Our minds are always
open to suggestions. This fact has
even been advertised in the Pitt
News. However, Mr. Kahn and

other disgruntled students, no one '
vever

comes up to 307 with
suggestions. Last year we extended
a survey to the student body. There
was no response, except for a few
students, who stated, that they’d
like to see the Beatles or the
Rolling Stones at Pitt.

Apathy is the _average Pitt
student’s middle name. A classic
example of student apathy which
directly affected the Programming
Committee was the loss of the SU
Annex, a fine entertainment
facility. ODI’s misrepresentations,
the administration’s appeasement

Notes for the keynote address at
an inauguration ceremony of
Student Government: ‘

I_can’t tell you how pleased I am
to have been chosen to represent
the administration at your inaugur-
ation. [If emcee forgets to
announce what your job is add: ‘‘In
case you are wondering who I am,
etc.” Elaborate on how your job
helps the students.]

what to speak about tonight. Three
topics were suggested to me, world
problems, sex or the personal lives
of your newly elected leaders. So I
decided to combine the three and
speak about the personal ’ sex
problems of your newly elected
leaders.” (Iflaughter go to III. If no

III) “In any case,” -- talk about

the seriousness of the job which

“This is the American way which
we are exhibiting here tonight.”

Socialists Defend
Judicial Ruling

Dear Editor: W

In the Pitt News dated Wednes-
day, January 29, an article ap-
peared by W. Jack Romberg enti-
tled ”.Ieopardi_zing SG Elections.”
The article pertains to the Judicial
Board's decision to allow, the
socialist candidates in this year’s
Student Government Elections to
identify themselves with the title
“Young Socialist.”

Mr. Romberg was either I] totally
unaware of the facts in the case,
which in itself is a 2 sign of
irresponsible journalism, or [2]
purposely falsified the facts to
mislead readers of the Pitt News.

Mr. ‘Romberg states that the
objection raised to the Election
Committee ruling, in that it was
made “ex post facto,” is obviously
ridiculous since the Elections Com-
mittee approved its bylaws in the
middle of last term./...” What is
obviously ridiculous to anyone fa-
miliar with the case is Mr.Rom-
berg’s article.

The law in the code approved by
the Elections Committee states,
“Political parties are not permit-
ted. However, this does not prohi-
,bit students from campaigning with
other “candidates.” Though we
object to forbidding political par-
ties, in that it attempts to make SG
Elections as apolitical as possible,
we followed this rule by declaring
ourselves a slate._ F '

do not forget your vanquished foes.

who tried to ‘defeat you.” (Ask
Andy, if this sounds too militaris-
tic. If so, change to: “those losers,
who did not make it.”) “Perhaps
their ideas are worthy of consider-
ation.” (Elaborate on charity to the
fallen, ﬁnd appropriate quote from
King James.)

VI) “You are about to embark on
the rocky road of government.
There will be many ups and downs,
but do not lose sight of the purpose
for which you were elected. I
remember when I was in col-
lege...” (Relate personal anecdote
about being president of fraterni-
ty.) “As Iovercame these obstacles
you can overcome yours.”

VII] “Now let me give you some
suggestions on how to handle the
problems which you will face in the
upcoming year.”

1. “Do not "attempt to slay ‘the
Golden Calf of administrative
bureaucracy. Rather, search for

ways to work with it and mold it to

your own needs.”
2.’ “Realize that- the public’ is

ignorant. Three months hence the
promises you made will have been
forgotten by all except a handful of
anarchists.”

3. “Stick 'to_ parliamentary
procedure, it is the best way to kill
unwanted controversy. Remember,
technicality is your best friend.”

4. “Finally, always remember
that golden rule,” (Find some
clever waylto restate the golden
rule, orhave secretary invent new
one.)

VIII) Talk about the University as
a microcosm of life, how the
experience gained here will carry

"into the real world, etc.

IX] “But remember, you are still
onlycollege students.” Discuss the
dangers of living in the Ivory Tower
of knowledge, etc.

XI.) Try to find good closing joke.
Ask Andy for something ethnic.
(Make sure no Jews or Italians are
elected.) If nothing suitable avail-
able, pose a thoughtful riddle. On
second thought, scratch riddle and
go to XI.

tions on becoming part of ‘ the
establishment.”

scon MACLEOD, Editor-in-Chief
MICHAEL CLINTON and AMY ELLER, Business _Managers

This same law applied in last
year’s elections, where socialist
candidates ran declaring them-

~ selves as the Young Socialist slate.

No objections were raised in last
year’s elections, and there was no
reason for us to believe that in this
year’s elections our slate would be
redefined as a political party. What
is the purpose of allowing slates if
they cannot be identified?

The ruling that was appealed. to
the Judicial Board was one made

by the Elections Committee in]

which, they deﬁned a political party
as “...an association of more than
one’person_ possessing a generic
title.” This ruling was made after
we declared ourselves as the Young
Socialist slate,’ and after we put
time and * money into campaign
material with that title. This ruling
was made during the campaign
period, and not before. It was a
direct attack on our campaign.
The Judicial Board did not repu-
diate “a code which it had ap-
proved only two months earlier,
thus destroying the consistency so

. desperately needed in SG Elec-

tions.” What they did do was to
overturn a ruling (which they did

I not approve as Mr. Romberg would

have us believe) made after cam-
paigning was begun. It was this
ruling which redeﬁned political

parties, and not the Judicial Board

decision, which destroyed the con-
sistency in the elections.

Mr. Romberg states in his article,
“...ignorance of the code is no
excuse.” We agree with you Mr.
Romberg, and feel that your “ig-
norance cf the code” did not justify
you in falsifying the facts as you

BY KATHRYN KIMBALL
Musical artists James Seals and
Dash ‘Crofts are members of a
religion known as the Baha’i faith.
Many of their songs are about their
beliefs.
The faith is one of the world’s
newest religions, and one of its

.' gentlest. According to the teach-

ings of Baha’u’llah, a “Lesser
Peace” will begin in the world
within the next 40 years through a
political unification of world na-
tions. ‘As the spiritual unity of the
faith grows, Baha’is believe, it will
ﬂower into the “Most Great
Peace.”

“Most of the songs of Seals and
Crofts are joyful,” said Dorothy
Hai, recording secretary of the

Baha’i community of Pittsburgh.
“They sing of what a blessing it is

to be born in a time when the world

is revitalizing itself, when the old is

~ slowly evolving into the new.”

The song “Hummingbird” is

about Baha’u’llah, the founder of

the faith. Some of the words to the
song are from the Baha’i scrip-
tures.

Baha’is believe God reveals his
word in each period of history
through an individual called a
The
teachings remain the same, but are
adapted to meet the needs of the
time. Through “progressive revel-
ation” the Baha’i .religion is
unfolded from age to age.

Unity is the main concept of the
Baha’i faith. Equality of races,

r sexes, and social classes was a

radical position for Baha’u’llah to
take in the 1860’s, and he was often
imprisoned and exiled.
“We are like many
colored flowers in the garden of

different‘

God,‘ making it more beautif ,”
said Hai.

“Anyone planting a garden
wouldn’t plant all yellow ‘or all
white ﬂowers. We have no right to
determine that one person is bettei
than another.”

.When true equality is achieved,
members of the Baha’i faith believe
extreme wealth and poverty will be
eliminated. A distribution of wealth
will be produced by a graduated
income tax with negative tax for
those not earning as much as most
people.

“It will be a real graduated tax,”
said Hai, “not the one we have now
that’s full of loopholes. There will
be no reason for people to exploit
each other because everyone will
be working. Work is the highest
form of devotion.”

'When Baha’i goals are attained,
there will be one international
government, language, system of
money and system of weights and
measures. Hai cites the expanding
use of the metric system as
evidence that the change is
beginning to take place.

“This international cooperation
will evolve slowly,” Hai stressed.
“People will realize the only way to

be saved is to help each other. The
world will adopt Baha’i principles
one by one without realizing their
source.”

“We’re like many souls in one
body,” continued Hai. “The mouth
has no strength without the hand to
feed it.” '

Education is important in the
Baha’i faith. “Most prejudice is the
result of ignorance,” Hai said.
“We also must learn all we can
about the arts and sciences in order
to progress.”

The children of Baha’i parents are
taught about all religions. At the
age of 15 they choose for
themselves which beliefs they will
follow. ‘

Baha’is are united through a
National. Spiritual Assembly.
“There is no campaigning involved

in the Assembly‘ elections, which '

negates the possibility of a
Watergate. We don’t even speak to
others about our choices, we pray,
then vote,” Hai explained.
Baha’u’llah also said it would be
at least 1000 years before another
messenger came, and he promised
mankind will survive at least
500,000 years. *
People will not be separated in the

2,.

“ 1   last i

hereafter according to Baha’u’llah.
There is no physical heaven or hell,
it’s only a state of mind depending
on whether or not an individual is
close to God. ,

The Baha’i faith was introduced in
the United States in 1892. “The

faith has grown fantastically in the_

last five or 10 years,” Hai said. “In
1970, 8000 people in one small
comer of South Carolina became
followers in a month. They were
mostly black, as blacks take tothe
faith faster than whites do.”

Attend the National ‘Student Conference Against Racism February 14-16,

Boston University, Boston, .Mass.

The racist violence which is being directed against black school children in Boston has national implications—-if it triumphs in the “cradle of
liberty” it will be used elsewhere. The only way .equal rights can be defended against the racist offensive is by strong,jvisible support for‘deseg-
regation. The National Student Conference Against Racism will help to defeat bigotry by showing the existence of massive national opposition to
racism. And it will draw people together to develop a strategy for overcoming racism in citiesthroughout the country. Come to the Boston Con-
ference. (Housing and child care are available.) . .

banner was pinned to the hood of
her 8-year-old sister's coat by an
“You’re not
supposed to eat those kinds of
wines,” said the 8-year-old.

Rabbi Winograd of the Interfaith
Committee spoke first at the rally
voicing sorrow for “those who gave
their lives for bread on the table.”

Several nuns were among the
audience, ‘‘I’m here basically to
show support for the poor people
who are basically powerless,” said
Sister Liguori Rossner "of Penn
Hills.

Bill Patterson of the Amal-
gamated Clothing Workers praised
the UFW as being inspirational for
workers who struck Farah last year.
“The UFW showed that if 'workers
joined together, ‘they can gain
economic and political power.”
Patterson also credited the Farm
Workers for “blazing the way”
with the boycott tactic.

According to Cathy Callahan of

the Pitt Farmworkers Support
Committee, “The reason why
students are crucially important is
we’re the ones that buy that stuff.”
“Gallo is the largest producer of
wine in the US. They produce 37%
of all US wine and 90% of all pop
wine,” said Frank Ortiz, UFW
organizer. -

“Gallo refused to renegotiate with L.‘

the UFW,” he said. “He brought
in this otherunion and said ‘this is
your union.’ ”

“For a head of lettuce, the farm
workers get ‘/2 cent.” Thus, he
added, even a big increase in
wages would only be a small
increase in prices.

“Gallo has kept the farmworkers
oppressed without any say over
their lives,” Ortiz concluded. “We
must make a concerted effort to get
him out, of the state stores.._”

About 30 students, one of four
groups who picketed downtown
after the rally, went to the state
store on 5th Avenue near the Plaza
building.

purchases over half of the grapes
grown for wine, and has inﬂuence
with other grape growers.

“Who verified the elections?”
Cappy said referring to the UFW
charge that the votes were verified
only by the Teamsters and Gallo.
“Signing a contract when

workers were on strike is against __

ethics.”

According to the manager of the
store, the picketing will help Gallo
sales. “People see the name Gallo,
they’re going to buy Gallo. Five or

The.'I_.‘.":ursday activities were fol-
lowed by picketing on Friday, with
eight to 10 people picketing the

more topical material. Instrumen-

tally,they rely on a bass and two

acoustic guitars, a six and a

twelve-string. Everything goes
through the amps so the natural

" quality of strict folk- music is lost.

On the other hand, the electric
distortion lets you hear each
modulation in the vocal note and
each phase in the instrumental.

works, ‘Sure Was and Buff Her

8:00 pm and on February 15 at 8:00

The Multigravitational Aerodance
Group, which has won rave reviews ‘

for its performances throughout the
world, includes four women and
two men. Buff, for example, which
waslcommissioned by the Ameri-
can Dance Festival in 1974, is
performed on a sparse set of seven
barely visible tightropes; the
dancers appear to have no form of

The other thing about

The group itself comes from
Oakmont. And it’s good to hear
familiar vocals done with an
Allegheny accent. The group does
heavily-rhythmed stories that you
can sit and listen to over beer. They
do rainy-day songs with lyrics like,
“don’t confront me with my
failures/ because I haven't forgot-
ten them.” And they do bluegrass
versions of things like Joni
Mitchell’s “Taxi.” It’s a gas just to
watch Chip Fisher pick his way
around twelve strings and to hear
him drawl, “Hey fawrmer, fawrm-
er, put away your DDT.” About the
only thing you could reproach the
group for, is for not letting Sarah
Gildersleve sing more often. When
at the end of the second set she
suddenly guts out “Hooked on
Codein,” you wonder why they’ve

The manager claims that The

in town where you can hear folk
played. To my knowledge he's
right. On Tuesdays and Saturdays,
they usually feature single acts,

and there is no cover. Wednesdays,

‘Lenny’: Great but

BY M. C. PILECKI
‘Screen biographies» are
inadequate.

There’s just so much time to work
with, and too often there's so much
more to put on the screen. A choice
has to be made to portray the
subject’s public life, or what made
him so great, or the subject’s
private life, or what led up to the
whole thing.

With Lenny, the choice would hurt
either way. Should the movie
portray “Dirty Lenny Bruce,” the
controversial comedian who raised
eyebrows and policemen’s billy-
clubs, and who is acknowledged as‘
the direct antecedent to modern
comedians? Or should the movie go
into what lay behind the stage
facade, into his dynamic love-hate
relationships with his mother, Sally
Marr, and his wife, Honey
[Harriet] Bruce?" ,

The Tony-winning play Lenn
chose the former route, in a

S0

roundabout way, dealing with
Lenny’s onstage words and subse-
quent prosecution. Of course, the
play did not have the cooperation of
Mrs. Bruce, who threatened legal
action if her name was used (Rusty
Ingram was the name of the wife in
the play), and so making her a
major character would have been
tricky, at best. I

The current movie tries the latter '

course, somewhat successfully. It’s
a hard-hitting drama all the way,
made even grittier by its black-and-
white newsreel-like approach. But
it leaves something missing. And
what’s missing is the public Lenny
Bruce.

It sounds kind of ridiculous, to
separate the two, because, of
course, the two are inseparable.
Each inﬂuences the other. But the
movie, in ordergto treat one side
properly, had to practically ignore
the other. If the viewer is not a
Lenny Bruce fan -- or at least has

specialities, doublespiked Irish and
Spanish coffees. '

The crowd there is fairly
conservative. They seem to go for
the atmosphere, which is that of a
studio with its hanging plants and
its paintings on exhibition. The
music seems to be reduced to just
background for conversation. And
it takes a thumping version of ‘a

Country Joe song to make people "

listen and clap.

I don’t recommend this place for
pure music enthusiasts.

all this fuss about this second-rate

The film, whether for reasons of
time-economy or to avoid the same
sort of hassle that plagued Bruce,
leaves out most of his more

the satires on religion, race

A can for the Definitive “Lenny"

(Continued from Page 7) '
But to those who don’t walk into
this movie blind, it’s a powerful

‘statement on the motivation" of a

man to greatness and to his
downfall. Valerie Perrine, as the
tragic innocent, Honey Bruce,

literally steals the picture from box
office biggie Dustin Hoffman. Arid
it’s Perrine, not Hoffman, who’s
expected to do the Oscar trip for
Lenny.

Hoffman does a very uneven
Bruce, at times “doing” Bruce, at
times almost portraying Bruce, but
mostly just being Dustin Hoffman.
Cliff Gorman, whose single-handed
powerhouse performance saved the
play Lenny from the oblivion
accorded by the over-direction,
would have been a better Bruce
on-screen, but he has no ‘box ofﬁce
pull. And a tricky enterprise like a
b/w pz biopic of Lenny Bruce needs

Bruce trying to perform before an

all the box office pull it can get.
There’s a certain amount of
falsifying expected in any movie,
but the particular subject of this
one and its documentary approach
make it seem rather hypocritical
and upsetting to devout Bruce fans.
And, just like Lenny in his lifetime,
the subject of Bruce’s alleged drug
addiction is almost entirely avoid-
ed. The ‘one scene of a stoned

in the 400 yard Medley Relay, Tom
Dowd and John Suprock did a
superb job in the 1000 yard swim

In the 200 yard Individual Medley,

. MarkiBoyett had his ﬁnest hour on
the floor exercise, and his twisting,

impressed the "judges well enough
that he scored 9.15.

After the floor routines, Pitt held
an early lead: 33.75. to'33.30,i a lead
which the Panthers‘ would not be
able to maintain.

Navy outscored the Panthers
30.45 to 28.45 on the Pommel horse
to gain the lead. While Don
Stevenson,_who ﬁnished first in the
all-around with 51 points, scored an
8.15 to pace Pitt on the horse, Navy
received a 9.45 and a 9.30 from

‘their two specialists, Brad Smith

- Navy then outscored the Cats on
the rings and vault, 35 to 31.60 and
36.20 to 36.00, respectively. The
vault continues to be the apparatus
on which the Panthers score the
highest, with Pasterick breaking,
and Tim Rand, Don Nixon, and
Stevenson striving to break the
much heralded 9.0 mark.

Pasterick and Papantonio paced
the Panthers on the parallel bars,
but Pete Wdowiarz scored an
incredible 9.55 for the sailors to
offset them.

‘moth teams scored 34 points on

the horizontal bar, but it was not
enough for ‘Pitt to overcome the

Coach Perez had to be glad that
‘his team had inched within. a few
points of the 200 mark, something
which hasn’t occurred at Pitt for a

long, long time. But at -the same

time, Perez was a little disgusted.

“Yeah, I’m disappointed in the

BY ANDY BEHREND H

Still smarting from a close defeat
at the hands of Clarion State earlier
in the week, Pitt’s wrestlers invad-
ed .Lock Haven Saturday night
ready to bully a few people. A

Well, Kevin Nellis did. . As did
Fuddy Bryant. And George
O’Kom. And possibly Bill Bailey,
who actually was a semi-bully.

But no one else, as Pitt squeaked
‘through with a 20-15 win over the
Eagles.

It appeared as if the Panthers

would end the match almost before i

it began, as Nellis romped over
Carl Lutz, 9-2, in the 118 pound
class. Fifty-six seconds later Bryant
made the team score nine-zip,
pinning Tom Parker. -

However, the romp was not to be,
as LH came back strong in the next
three‘ matches.

Don Rother, subbing for injured
Pitt All-American Rande Stottle-
myer, fell to‘ the Eagle’s Tim
McCamuley, 11-4 at 134 pounds.

Gary Walk put the Eagles three
points closer tying the match,
decisioning Bill Korth, 4-1, then
Dave Crowell" evened the match by
bombing Skip Bolin, 14-5, ruining
Bolin’s homecoming.

At 158 John Chatman had his
second straight tie, with George
Way, 1-1. The tie kept‘ the team

scores dittoed at" 11, but George

.

O’Kom continued his unbelievable
grappling, as he hammered Greg
Hackenberg, 17-6, for a superior
decision. ‘

Craig Evans of Pitt followed
O’Korn’s wizardry by coming back
to tie Ron McMurray, 8-8. Evans

1 found himself down by four points

quickly, but took command later in
the match, earning the deadlock.
In perhaps. the evening's most
exciting match, Bill Bailey over-
came a bell-ringing and a ﬂurry of
ﬁsts to defeat Art Baker, 6-3.
Bailey was knocked groggy in the
second period, but befuddled Ba-.
ker so much by maintaining a lead,
that the LH wrestler threw a couple
of punches. The referee disquali-
fied Baker, then looked around at
the furious crowd, and changed his
mind. No matter, as Bailey gutted

' out the win. Baker’s actions cost

his tea_m one point in the overall
totals. '

Jim Schuster (LH) made the ﬁnal
score 20-15 by beating Carl Roba,
5-1. .

NOTES:Coach Dave Adams says
part of Chatman’s problem stems
from an ankle injury, which has

tioning.

FERDINAND ROTEN GALLERIES  l

TO PRESENT

EXHIBIT/SAALE or
ORIGINAL PRINTS
Works by Modern.
and Old Masters

Span Six Centuries

THE COMMITTEE ON THE ARTS, University of
Pittsburgh, will sponsor an exhibit and sale of ap-
proximately 600 original prints from the famed
Ferdinand Roten Galleries collection on the 12th
of February.

The event will be held at Student Union Art Gal-
lery.

Along with prints by such masters as Picasso, Goya,
Renoir and Hogarth, can be seen works by many of
of today’s American artists, some famous and some
not yet famous. »

Area residents are invited to browse through this
outstanding collection of original graphics. A know-
ledgeable Roten representative will be on hand to
answer questions about the prints and the artists
and to discuss other prints not in this collection
but which may be obtained from the gallery in
Baltimore. —
A world-respected authority on graphics of all
types, Roten holds exhibitions and sales at major
museums, colleges, art galleries and art centers
throughout the United States and Canada.

The informal displaying of the collection allows
visitors to examine at close range the various graph-

' ic techniques of different artists.

The exhibit takes place from 10 A.M. to 8 P.M.

them. ‘
Less than 20 minutes later the
Panthers had their second place

finish wrapped up as Jay Sharpley '

ran a 8.5 in the 70 yard hurdles.
Finishing only a step behind win-
ner John Johnson of NCAA outdoor
champ Tennessee, Sharpley was a
bit disappointed.

“I know if the event had been the
120 yard hurdles I could have
won,” said Sharpley. “I was
running well and almost had him. I
did have a nice start and that help
me a lot.” V

Another ﬁne performer is Dave,‘

MacDonald, one of Banner’s
Freshman corps who has been

performing well all season." You‘,

haven’t heard much of the 18 year
old from_ Churchill because he
performs in the relays, the land of
faceless names.

Running the distance medley
relay MacDonald ran the mile
anchor leg in 4:09.5, which isn’t
bad for a frosh.

“I still have a lot to learn about

running indoors (the mustachioed '

Mac had no indoor track at Chur-
chill High)’ but I 'I am’ getting
better.” » - ‘

The 600 yard run was one of the
most exciting races of thenight
with Stan Vinson of Eastern Michi-
gan winning the event in a time of
l:08.4, the second fastest time ever
ran ‘on a ﬂat track in the 600.

Chuck Mozingo of Pitt took a
strong fourth in the event but was
obviously unhappy with his time.

“I did what I wanted to do and
qualiﬁed for the Nationals,” said
the ﬂoppy-haired Senior. “But I
think I could have taken a second

place ﬁnish. Coming off the last ..
almost completely“

turn I was
straight upand down, I lost my
natural lean and couldn’t regain
it.” - . '

“I. let .Vinson (the eventual win-
ner) drift ahead of mewhich was
my biggest mistake of the race. I
ran too slow of a quarter mile
instead of staying with him.”

The worst injury to the team
didn’t take place on the track but in
the hotel room. Karl Farmer who
would have given Reggie Jones of
Tennessee a test in the 300 yard
dash and who also was to anchor
Pitt’s mile relay team was shot

' down by the flubug with a 102-

degree temperature and couldn’t

compete.

“The loss of Farmer was indeed a

, ;h

serious blow to us,” said Banner," ,

“but it wasn’t worth it to risk his
health fora race.” ‘

“Our distance medley with three ”
freshmen and a sophomore were in
contention all the'way and strong
until the end,” Banner continued.

Then smiling he said, “I couldn’t I
have‘asked for better perform-
ances.” ‘ ‘ ‘ V

BY ANDY BEHREND

Iwasn’_t there Saturday when Pitt
played and prayed its way through V
a victory over the Athletes in
Action. I wish I would’ve been,
though. I could’ve used the laugh.

The laugh came after the ‘game,
when several AIA players, among
them Scott Weakley, Ben Garner
and Bob Hornstein, produced a
microphone and sauntefed out to
mid-court. They explained that
they all played basketball for Jesus

/.---.Christ.

5'.Now I can see that; I mean, what
the hell? Some people play for
money, some for enjoyment. So
playing for Christ is about par for
the course.

But now, Ben Garner speaks, and
as my friend relates to me his tale, I
giggled.

“I didn’t know what I wanted out.
of life,” said Ben Garner. “I want
to play basketball, but I was just

sitting on the bench. Then Jesus

came into my life...’?
Yeah, and Garner found his way
into Wichita State’s starting line-

throughout the country. They tra-

up. Jesus taught Ben Garner how
to fire in 20-footers, and stick his
man on defense. Absurd.

Now this is not so good. There a
probably a lot of little kids aspiring
for heavenly heights in sports. And

they'll hear a spiel like Garner's,‘

and consult that big referee in the
sky. .OK, I mean, I’m knocking the
belief. But what happens to the kid
who can’t swish a hoop after he
consults Jesus? It’s not Jesus’
the kid just isn’t good
enough.

And Jesus did not put in Ben
Gamer’s 20-footers. Ben Git-Be}
did. "And nightly prayers to Christ

or Allah or Porky Pig aren’t going

to change Ben’s or anyone else’s
performance. Practicing might, but
not the prayers.

-Amen.

very suited to the Cats’ usual style
and pretty much predicted the
79-65 Cat victory. The contest
wasn’t much more than a practice
session for Pitt.

Kirk Bruce, who is averaging
around 17 points this season, was
the game’s leading scorer as his
smooth jump shot netted him 20
points. Three other Cats, Melvin
Bennett, Tome Richards, and Lew

Hill, made it to double ﬁgures, —

each scoring 12 points. ‘

Dann Beard, from Kansas State,
was the high scorer for AIA with 18
points. He was followed by Scott
Weakley [Capital] and Bob Hom-
stein [West Virginia] with 10 and
12 points, respectively.

The Panthers will return to regu-
lar season action on Wednesday
night in Fitzgerald Fieldhouse
when they host the West Virginia
Mountaineers in a contest which
just might determine the Panthers’
division tournament invitation.
WVU is presently 12-7 following‘ a
big upset victory over Syracuse.
