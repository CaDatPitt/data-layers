The Student Government Board
(SGB) heard the budget requests of

V the governance groups in last week’s

meeting. The governance groups on
campus are the Resident Student
Association (RSA), Black Action
Society (BAS), The Interhonorary
Council (IHC), the Interfraternity

Council, (IFC), the Nursing Student 4

Organization (NSO), the Engineer-
ing Student Cabinet (ESC) and the
Panhellenic Association (Panhel).
The discussion between the SGB
and outgoing RSA president Jay
Nalli generated the most controv-

ersy. RSA requested $20,757; the-

Allocations Committee recom-
mended that $10,683 be approved,
$7,182 be denied and $3,143 be
deferred.»

The Allocations Committee
recommended that two programs
requested by RSA be scaled down.
RSA requested $911 to send 10 peo-
ple to the national NACURH con-
ference at Penn State and $972 to
send ‘l0 people to the regional
NACURH conference at Kutztown
State University. The Allocations
Committee recommended that for
the national conference $272 be
funded and $231 be deferred, while

C for the regional conference $272 be.
- funded and $292 deferred.

James Shelton, chairman of the
Allocations Committee, explained
that there is a standing policy that
statesa maximum of four people can
be sent to conferences. According to
Shelton, the policy was established '
to cut down on the cost of sending
people to conferences. . ’

“There is no way that four people
can atte-nd all the meetings being
held" at the conference,” Nalli said.
According to Nalli, at last year’s
conference held in Wisconsin, peo-
ple were forced to choose which
meeting to attend. Nalli said that
this is what they are trying to avoid
by sending 10 people to the confer-
ence as all the meetings held at the

  Board Reviews And Disputes Budgets   

conference deal with resident stu-
dent's problems. He added that the
other schools usually send between -
l0. and 15 people.

The Allocations Committee
recommended that many of The Pitt
News ads requested-by RSA not be
funded. Shelton said, “We adopted a
new policy this year—that general
meeting announcements be put in
the personal section of the paper.”
According to Shelton, this-was done

. to cut down orithe number of Pitt

News’ ads requested by organiza-
tions. - “Yet student groups still
request many large display ads," h
said. . . -

The women’s movement has
made great strides since the,
rebirth of feminism. But, accord-
ing to former president of the
National Organization for
Women (NOW), it still has a long
road to travel.

Wilma Scott Heide, who also
helped to establish the first Pitts-
burghchapter of NOW, spoke at
the YWCA Saturday as part of
the local celebration of National
Women’s History Week. Her lec-
ture, “Feminism Is Our Des- ‘
tiny,” touched on the inequalities
in the fields ‘of health care, the
media, education, economics
and religion.

1 "Heide attributes the beginning
of her awareness of women’s
oppression to her experience as a
nurse. Health care may be aug-
mented by medicines and physi-
cal technologies, she said, but “it
is not the same as medical care.

“We cannot afford to let physi-
cians, whose training is primarily
for disease and pathology, to
dominate that which is truly
health care.” Heide -"suggested
that physicians and nurses estab-
lish a complementary interaction

Women’s Movements Still Behind, 1
Former NOW President Says

rather than one of “continued
subordination.”

“I am not advocating that
nurses practice medicine without
a license. I am advocating that
physicians stop practicing nurs-
ing and oppressing nurses with-
out a license,” Heide said.

In the media, Heide said, she
and other feminists are pushing

. for a “Face The Feminists”-type

‘ program that would address the.
equalities as well as the inequali-
ties of women’s lives.

“The broadcast media, pre-
sumably licensed in the public
interest, are not yet serving the
interest of the public," Heide
said. “We simply can’t afford
patriarchal definitions of what is
newsworthy, and~——therefore—
who is important and who is
newsworthy. It is an inaccurate
and dangerous perception, and
until we do something, they;are
going to pay us [women] token
attention.” .

Currently a professor _of
women’s studies at Sangainon
University in Springfield, Ill.,
Heide said many schools, espe-
cially within the elementary lev-
els, are still teaching girls to be
submissive. '

H which is a violation of the 13th

. done by women, and only 10 per-

said. '

“Elementary education is
mandatory for the first 16 years
of one’s life,” she said, “so the
girls are forced toiattend institu-
tions that, in many ways, still
teach.the-m to be subservient,
subordinate and submissive.
That is involuntary servitude,

Amendment of the Constitu-
tion.”

On the subject of economics,
Heide said, “Women throughout
the world are the real proletariat. _
In every country of the world,
women are the majority of the
poor.” --

Citing a study done by the
International Labor Organiza-
tion, which is part of the United
Nations, Heide reported that 66
percent of the world’s work is

cent of the actual pay for work
done goes to women. At the same
time, women own only 1 percent
of the world’s property.
“Anybody who has the audac-
ity to say there is no need for a
women’s movement obviously .
does not care about women,”she

Students soon may hear some
changes in WPGH’s«format as its
application to exist on the FM com-
mercial band is up for review in the
next four to six weeks by the Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC). _ _ ' _ _

An FCC. presiding Judge will then
decide whether or not WPGH’s
request is a “purple cow” in terms of

‘whether it is a one-time thing and
not precedent setting for other edu-
cational institutions, to follow,
- according to Larry Lunsford,.ass'_is-
tant director of student activities
and Pitt’s media advisor.
- Existing on the FM commercial
dial, specifically at 98.5, WPGH,
» which is currently a carrier-current
station (broadcasting through tele-
phone broadcast loops to the resi-
dence halls and the student union),
would then have a seven- to eight-
mile radius and an output of 18
_watts. ‘

Tom Walsh, program director of
WPGH said that the station now
only reaches about 4,000 students

out of a total student population of

30,000. .

Nalli said that the reason RSA

' requests so many ads is that many of

their programs are poorly atended.
Another reason, according to Nalli,
was that some of their scheduled
programs are early in the year and
that The Pitt News is the only way to
let people know about them.

Nalli cited last year's ﬂoor repre-
sentative’ orientation meeting as an
example. According to Nalli, the
meeting was poorly attended.

“The main excuse we got [for not
attending the meeting] was, ‘we
_didn’t know about it,’”Nalli said. He
‘added that they can't rely on the
iRA’s to convey much of the infor-
mation to the students.

I Shelton said, “The people in the

audience——you have both RAs and

floor reps—is it the-SGB’s job to

make sure they [the residents] know

~ what is going on or is it your [the

RSA’s]job? The Pitt News is not the

‘answer to your problems. The Pitt

News is effective to a point, then it is
up to you to think of other ways to
get in contact with the residents and
let them know what is going on.
“Why can’t the RAs and the floor
he used to pass along
information?“ — '
A spokesman for RSA who
accompanied Nalli said, “the RA's
are not part of RSA; we have other
ways of getting the word out—let’s
face it, "the RAs are not reliable.

_After all, they are: university

employees.” -
‘Shelton asked, “What about the
‘floor reps; what is theirjob; why are
they elected to positions; what are
they supposed to do-—other than
hold a title?”
The allocations recommendation
on the RSA budget was rejected 5-1,
with Kathy ‘Brown casting the dis-

sentingvote. The RSA budget now-
goes back .t__o th.€.,AIloca,tions Com-

are a capturedl

mittee, where a compromise will be
worked out on the conference trips
and the Pitt News ads.

Bruce Rogers, president of the
Black Action Society, said “We are
very pleased with the way the budget
turned out.” BAS requested $35,652
and received $32,784. Also $1,475
was put in escrow, $650 was deferred
and $743 was denied. Rogers had
only one complaint with the budget:
BAS hadrequested $3,100 honora-
rium for the Benjamin Hooks Lec-
ture and an additional $36 to take
him’, out to dinner. According to
Shelton, the Allocations Committee
understood the honorarium to
include all meals. Rogers said that
wasn’t the case. ’

The allocations recommendation

was rejected unanimously by the‘

board. The BAS budget now goes

. back to the Allocations Committee

to correct the honorarium problem.
According to Shelton, the problem
was all a misunderstanding."

The Engineering Student Cabinet
(ESC) requested $26,418 in this
budget. The Allocations Committee
recommended that $9,047 be
funded, $8,827 be put in escrow,
$5,555 be deferred and $2,988 be
denied. Dan Forest, spokesman for
the engineers, said, “We are pleased
with the budget recommendations
except for a few things.”

According to Forest, there is a
campus phone in the lobby of Bene-

.dum for use by all students and that
traditionally the SGB had allocated
money for it.”’Board member -Ken
Strarn said, “We discussed this ear-
lier and_we decided that we are not
responsible for the phone. It would
be like allocating funds for the Tow-
ers Lobby phone.” Stram added that

the School of Engineering should i

pay for it. -

nition Night program. was com-

pletely turned down. “We keep

Literary experts do not have to be
boring; Robert Gale, a colorful
member of the Pitt English depart-
ment, is living proof of this fact.

Gale teaches literature classes,
writes books and is an insatiable
reader. As a true lover of literature,
he has written enough volumes to fill
several shelves in his office.

Gale said he is interested in several
different periods of literature but
favors the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Authors Henry James and
»Mark Twain, the subjects of much of
his writing, are his two favorite.

“I like Henry James the best
because he’s a fine stylist and writes
about Americans in Europe,” Gale
said.

“I like (Twain’s) healthy pessim-
ism and his kind of dispeptic view of
the late 19th and 20th century. I
think the events of the 20th century
have validated his pessimistic
opinions.” ‘

Gale has spent quite a bit of time
studying Twain and has written sev-
eral volumes on his works including
a two-volume index" of Twain’s
works that catalogues over 7,000
characters and 830. plots.

It took Gale seven years to com-

- plete the set; he read Twain’s com-

plete works—including, those that
were never published.

He has”a1so catalogued several
other authors, including Poe and
Melville.

A native of Iowa, Gale had inter-
ests both in literature and in science
when he was a boy. “I always liked to
read everything from fiction ‘ to
science,” he said. i

As "a boy, he was an amateur
astronomer. This led him to start
college as a math major. However,
he soon discovered he liked litera-
tu re better and decided to make it his
life’s work. .

Gale attended Dartmouth and
received a B.A. summa cum laude
before entering the Army, where he
did counter-intelligence work.

One of Gale’s more colorful esca-
padestranspired while he was in the

hoping and asking for this pro-
gram," Forest said in defense of the
program..“The way the university
handles graduation is insufficient—
not only for our school, but for every
school on campus. We just decided
to do something on our own. It is a
night where faculty and the dean
come up to recognize the seniors
after four years of hard work.” _

Forest added‘ that it was. not a
graduating ceremony but a recogni-
tion ceremony.

Board member Kathy Brown
said, “I am in favor of this program
even though policy dictates that we
should turn it down. A program like
this would be good for all schools-
not just engineers. And I think a
program like this is worth it-people
go through rigorous academic sche-
dules in all schools."

Shelton said, “In the end, we
would be having -graduations for
every school on campus in addition
to the ceremony at the Civic Area.”

Brown, said, “1 think we should
reward the engineers’ enthusiasm by
funding this program. After all, they
took the initiative to develop the
program." . '

“We aren’t saying we deserve this
any more than anyone else; but there
is a need within the university for a
program like this," Forest said.

The second problem in the engi-
neers’ budget was the cutting of the
-Parents’ Night program. Forest

said, “This is a trditional program in .

Engineers’ Week, although the name
‘Parents’ Night‘-might be a little
misleading-—it is now more of an
open house.“ A

Shelton said, “The program is
mainly put on for the parents, and
maybe the responsibility for that
program should go to the School of
Engineering and not the SGB. It is
not something‘thc SGB should be
concerned with."

Army. He attended basic training
twice. It seems he went through boot
camp once and failed. Rather than
actively participate a second time, he
would show up for roll call and
promptly disappear afterwards.
Despite his performing in this
manner for 45 days, Gale made it
through his second basic training
and began working for Army
intelligence. _
After Gale completed his stint in
the service, he attended Columbia
University and obtained his, Ph.D.
with his dissertation entitled “Imag-
ery in the Fiction of Henry James.”
Gale is also interested in modern

westerns and has recently made -'

them the subject of his writing. Gale
corresponds with Will Henry, a
modern writer ‘of westerns.

“I think thebest, from a historical -
point of view, is Will Henry,” Gale
said. He has written a full-length
book _ on Henry and has begun

extensive work on western writing. _'

Gale has done critical work on
many important‘ western authors
such as Luke Short and Francis
Parkman.

These westerns are by no means
boring, Gale explained. Working in
this field of study is exciting and a
job, he said.

One of the most_thrilling moments

- Gale experienced during his western
study was meeting Short’s widow.
She told him many things he said he
would not have been able to learn
otherwise. .

Gale also enjoys paintings of the
West. The Wild West calendar in his
office embodies this passion.

Gale is a very successful literary
critic and considers himselt a minor
expert in 19th century literature. “I
apply the lessons of literature, and
this helps you recognize your mis-
takes," he said.

Gale is an expert in literature, but

when asked if he has written any of
his ownfiction, he said, “1 would

have loved to have been a successful

novelist. I tried two "novels, and_I
found I had no originality. I wrote

' two novels, and I burned-them-

ended in a tie, which sent it back to
the Allocations Committee- The
Allocations Committee was told to
look over the Senior Recognition
Night program- '

The Panhellenic ‘ Association
request-ed $18,882. The Allocations
Committee recommended that
$10,109 be approved, $2,824 be
deferred and $5,949 be denied.
According to Panhel president Lynn
Weinberg, the only problem with the
budget was the funding to print reg-
istration cards, ballots and bid
cards. Weinberg said, “For us to
execute RUSH, these three things
are a necessity.” ,

Shelton suggested that the print— ‘

ing be done by the.SGB’s Gestetner
printing machine. Shelton said, “If

the printing cannot be done on this .

machine, ‘we would be willing to
send the request over to Central,
Printing.” .

The SGB voted to accept the Pan-
hel request with one stipulation—
that Gestetner’ printing be tried first.
The vote was 5-1, with Barry Greene
casting the dissenting vote.

The budgets of the Interfraternity
Council, the lnterhonorary Council
and the Nursing Student Organiza-
tion were passed unanimously. The
SGB passed these budgets without
discussion when no representatives
of these groups attended the board
meeting. ’ -

The lnterhonorary Council
requested $7,003 and received
$5,051, with $225 to be held in
escrow, $912 to be deferred and
$1,088 to be denied. The1HC budget
covers the budgets of Lambda
Sigma, Phi Eta Sigma, Alpha
Epsilon Delta and Omega Delta
Kappa to name a few. ,

The Interfraternity Council
requested $8,520 and received
$7,337. Some ofthe expenditures in

they were absolutely terrible.

Gale teaches the literature of the
19th and 20th centuries, but he also
teaches courses on the Roaring
Twenties and Western literature. He
said he tries to share his appreciation
and enthusiasm with his students.

. Gale, a member of the Pitt faculty
since I959, said, “The writing pro-
gram is fine and nationally known.
It has been strengthened right
a1ong—it has been getting better and

better.” He added that Pitt has a L

nationally. known publishing
faculty. '

In Gale’s opinion, “The high-
points of literature are in the 14th
and 15th centruy Romantic Period,
but the 19th century is the richest
period."

Gale said, “English is the richest
language, and I hate to see what peo-
ple are doing to this beautiful
language.”

‘ Gale said the highlights of his
career have been helping students
with Ph.D. dissertations and writing
his books. One book of which he is
especially proud is about Francis
Parkman, a blind historian who tra-
veled the West and lived among the
Indians.

He has written for several differ-
ent publications and -is currently
writing western essays for various
colleges and magazines.

Gale is an insatiable reader. When
asked how many books he has read,
he just laughed; He works everyday
and enjoys his work.

Gale saidthat one of his greatest
loveswith which he has the most fun
is in getting students turned on to
literature. He recommends the .
classics—-“Moby Dick,” “Huckleb-
erry Finn” and “The Great Gatsby.”

If one gets the chance to sit in on
one of Dr. Gale’s classes, he will
-soon discover that Gale is not the
stereotyped literature professor, but
is instead a colorful, enthusiastic
teacher truly interested in the mate-
rial with which he works. A

WPGH To Be Reviewed By FCC

'  continued from page one

“If we are able to go FM, we will
be able to‘ reach our market——the
off-campus students as well as resi-
dent students,” Walsh said.

Instead of applying for an educa-
tional license on a traditionally edu-
cational band,’ Pitt is applying for an
educational stationgon the FM com-
mercial band due to frequency con-
flicts with Carnegie—Mel1on’s
WRCT station and Bethany Col-
lege’s’WBVC station.

Conney Kimbo, vice-chancellor

/,-jgfor student affairs, said, “We

‘initially’ applied for a non-
commercial station, but this came
into conflict with CMU and
Bethany. We then met as three insti-
tutions to determine.a solution to
the problem; after which we applied
to the FCC for a spot on the FM
commercial band.”

Kimbo said the FCC looked at
WPGI-l’s applicationibut considered
it too precedent. setting. _ . _

Pitt nowhas to prove that its
request is a “purple cow”——“We

. have to show that this has never been
done before, it never will be done

again_and that we are a unique case -

and that's ‘why [the FCC] should
-. grant it,” Lunsford said.

 Lunsford said the FCC does not I
want P.itt’s request to exist on the

FM commercial band to “openthe
ﬂoodgate to a lot of new applica-
tions.” He added this is a case so
distinct and ' unusual that it will
never be likely to occur again,_ther_e-
fore a decision in favor of Pitt will
not serve as a precedent. _ .
, Lunsford said that the end of this
five-year dispute will occur by the
end of spring but did not make pre-
dictions about WPGH’s chances of
becoming an FM station. “One of

three things will happen: either the -

FCC will rule in favor of Pitt at this
hearing coming up in the next four
. to six weeks; the FCC will reject our

C" it request, which means we are back to

the drawing board; or Pitt will with-
draw and call it quits," he said.

Without a doubt, students who
work for WPGH say that it would be
a good thing and that students
deserve to get it.

as the “Sound of Brooklyn,” said,

The Juvenile Justice Center of
Pennsylvania is offering a train-
ing course for students, profes-
sionals and anyone interested in
childrens’ rights and juvenile jus-
tice beginning March 15 and last-
ing for eight weeks. -

The program, “An Overview

' of the Juvenile Justice System,” '
will include such topics as the
history of child welfare and juve-
nile justice, childrens’ legal
rights, the purpose of the law,
court intakes and procedures,
the taking of a child into protec-
tive custody, legislative rules and
regulations, criminal proceed-
ings, detention and institutional
placements, alternatives to incar-
ceration, delinquency prevention
and citizen involvement.

The instruction will include P
field trips to juvenile courts and ‘
detention facilities, films, lec-
tures and discussions. Upon
completion of the program, the
participant will be certified to
work with the Department of
Public Welfare in inspecting
juvenile facilities and to work

monitoring

juvenile programs.

The classes will be held every
Tuesday from 9:30 a.m. until
12:-30 p.m.‘at the First United
Methodist Church, Center and
South _Aiken aves. For more
information, contact the Juve-

_ nile Justice Center.

this would bring us a lot more pro-
moters and advertisers; I think we
deserve to get it.”

Brad Amper, DJ at Shippings-
burg, appeared as a guest DJ on

_ WPGH last Friday. “I say give it to
’ them. They [Pitt] have better equip-

ment than we [Shippingsburg] do,
but they don’t have the power,”

Amper said.

Pitt has a better station\and a bet-
ter opportunity for students to
expand their abilities, Amper said,
adding that “we’re'[Shippingsburg] _
tighter and have much more forma-
tion to our programs.

 

Walsh said that if WPGH were to
go FM, this would add to the profes-
sionalism of the university radio
experience. .

“Because we would be competing
with other professional stations, I
think students would have a ten-
dency to prepare more and try to
compete with the professionals,” he
said.

As far as technical aspects are
concerned, Walsh said that training
will be longer, approximately six
sessions. The DJ will have to work

- his ‘voice, however, on the air as well
as in training, and pre-"programming
will be used much more.

Pre-programming means that the .

music will already be pre-selected
forthe DJ. Presently, Walsh said,
the programming is pretty much up
to the DJ.

“Wewant to maintain a level of
quality,” Walsh said.’ “We will play
anything as long as it’s good, but we
also want to tighten up on our music
so as to have a format comparable to
other FM stations.” »

Students would not notice a big
change in the type of music WPGH
plays, except that they would lose
some of the vintage rock like The

- Doors and The Who, according to
Walsh.

Walsh’ said the station would be
more likely to draw from sources
such as MTV for the type of music it
would play because “people are
addicted to MTV now.” The station
would, however, remain an album-
oriented rock station..

Walsh is optimistic about the
staion as it now stands. “What we
have now is great. If we never go
FM, we will be the best carrier-
current station in the nation.”

He said phonelines are being
upgraded to sound better and
clearer and that in September, the
station might be on the air 24 hours a
day. = ., . '

The news and sports formats
would. not change as significantly as
the music format. Instead of being
reported once an hour as now, they
would alternate twice an hour.

Opinion

The Pitt News, Monday March 14, 198

 

Value of Time

It was an impressive show. The chancellor—flanked
by his top lieutenantsi—-recognized the accomplish-
ments of Pitt students and faculty in the splendor of
Carnegie Music Hall. It was a symbolic event, and

‘ appropriately, the most pervasive symbol was thatof
the assembly line. , , '

With few exceptions, no individual was honored at
this year’s Honors Convocation. Instead, whole ﬂocks
stood on cue to receive the prepacked gratitude of the ’
university. In an event designed to celebrate the
noblest ideals of highereducation, the university pro-
claimed that concern for individuals here has become

' the emptiest of shells.

This year, that proclamation holds cruel irony. Indi-
viduals have given Pitt more to be proud of in 1983
than ever before——including‘a Rhodes Scholar, two
Harry S. Truman Scholars and a handful of Fulbright
Scholars. .

Of course, Pitt is a large school, and to afford indi-
vidual attention to every accomplishment would take
a lot of time. But what is the value of time when
compared to these supposedly noble ideals?

Any student unfortunate enough to have had _to deal
with an administrative office of the university knows
what it is like to be treated like an impediment to
adminstrative efficiency. While this regrettable atti-
tude, one could argue, can be excused in the day-to-
day operation of the university, it is shocking when
allowed to prevail at an event with the significance of
the Honors Convocation.

Even on a day-to-day basis, this pattern should» not
be brushed aside and excused. Remember, other large
universities find a way to encourage and reward
achievements in their students,

-Pitt holds an Honor Convocation every year, so it is
true that "Pitt does care. It is unfortunate, however,-
that this care shows itself usually after" the fact. It
wasn’t always this way. The chancellor used to shake
students’ hands and talk to theni—'sh'ow sincere
congratulations. _

This traditioniis dying. This perception—that stu-
dents at Pitt are oftenlittle more than a number—
could very well become detrimental to those same
values of which Pitt now boasts. At the very least, with
the decrease in enthusiasm exhibited by students who
feel (perhaps correctly) that they are not encouraged,
could come a decrease in support when those students
become alumni. I e

As the demands for their services extend beyond the
immediate campuses, universities are becoming more
like businesses. This attitude should never be applied
to students so that they feel they are on an assembly
line. This goes against every principle on which higher_
education is built. ’

A Letters To The ;iEditot‘i

LimitingiNewslnformation

Dear Editor: '

Your Feb. 28 editorial declares
that “everybody [in this case stu-
dents] has a right to know what is

happening -within his world.” You

failed to notice that the title of the
editorial, “Editors’ Rights,” actually
was much more precise in terms of

the argument you make. Even the

wildest imagination cannot justify
any assertion that any newspaper
“represents”-its readers. Analysis
can proceed from a number of
directions.

A newspaper, at best, can contain
only what its editor and/or pub-
lisher have decided to tell its readers.
This is nothing more than an opin-
ion of what may have happened,
combined with an opinion of what
the happening means.. In this sense,

any editor and/or publisher pre-‘

sumes to ‘instruct readers as to what

' they should accept as fact. By defini-

tion, any other opinions are ruled
out. In other words, a student’s
“right to know” is limited to what
you wish him to “know." A

Dear Editor:

When I read in the Pitt News that
the rape hearings ofthe two Pitt stu-
dents had been waived for two to
three months, I was enraged. How
many times does a woman's body
need to be examined for evidence
and since when does a state of
drunkenness dismiss responsibility

. for one’s own actions?

In this context, reporters have no

v responsibility at all for what appears

in the paper,-a positionstrongly
‘argued by,T71e New York Times,
among others. Generally, reporters
do not have a “right” to express
opinions contrary to those of editors

and publishers, so the answer to.

your question (“What‘would have
happened if the publishers of The
Washington Post told two -of its edi-
tors to ‘sit’ on the Watergate story?”)
is nothing. Newspapers “sit” on
many stories, depending upon the
whims of editors and publishers.

I recently sent you a letter taking‘

issue with the lengthy defense of
facility‘ evaluations» by Robert
Wolke of the Office of Faculty
Development. Apparently,_ you
decided that Wolke should have the
last word on‘ the subject, so my
‘response was rejected. Do I have a
right to make sure students hear my
views on anything? (Only ifl publish
my own paper.) Do I have a legiti-
mate right to protest your rejection?

_ Of course not.

Much of democratic political the-
ory consists of an ‘attempt to make
things sound good by turning them

. Story EnragesReader

Continual postponement of rape
cases is a common and cruel court
joke which repeatedly victimizes the
witness bygcausing her to recount,
time after‘ time, a frightening and
painful experience.

The right to a speedy trial/ hearing
should not be denied—for the sake
ofthe victim. '

Psst! Your Paranoid Liberalism is Showing

x

By JAMES KANE

 l, I ran. into my friend Joe the other day. As

we were exchanging pleasantries, he kept
looking over his shoulder. I ﬁnally had to
ask him whatwas up.

“Well,” ‘Joe began, “there’s something
funny going on. On my way home from the
Not-Conservative Student Network meet-
ing, I noticed a black 1967 sedan following
me.” ’

Joe walked over to his car when we were
done talking. As he drove off, I saw a black
sedan follow him around the_corner. I had

‘ thought hewas just being paranoid, butper-

haps I was wrong. ‘

When I got home that night, I called
another friend, who just happened to be

*',$?,‘;involved with theldealistic Student For Dis-

armament Study Group. When I asked her
about a meeting that I had. missed the other
night, she_quickly told me that she didn’t
want to talk on the phone. She asked me to

. meet her in the last booth in the back of Sam

Opinion

and Bernie’s Bar. _
“Did anyone‘ follow you here?” she asked
me as she adjusted her paste-on moustache.

“No, I don't think so. Would you please

take off that hat and moustache? It’s awfully .

hard to talk to you when you look like that.”

“No way,” she said quietly. “They may be I
in here right now.”
“Wh0?"

“The~FBI agents who have been following
me. They’ve tapped my phone, too.”
“But isn’t that illegal?”

“It used to be. Don't you bother to read ’

the papers? Reagan cut the strings from the
FBI. 'They’re allowed to do all sorts of spy
hanky—panky now.” ' i

“That” must explain why Joe thought .

somebody was following him in a black
sedan today.” ’

“Yeh, they’ve got him pegged, too. The
FBI thinks that we’re all Communists. I’ll
bet you’re bugged right now!" Saying that,

’she pulled me into the bathroom and

searched me for an electronic listening
device. Satisﬁed that I was “clean,” she

pushed me out the door and back into our.

Past And Present Events istort ed 0

Dear Editor: ‘
In recent weeks, several openly anti-
Communist pieces by Scott Rex have

_“_,—,=}_~appeared which have contained major

distortions of past and present events. '
Rex argues that the “nuclear freeze”
movement should exclude Communists
and uses two major lines of reasoning:

OCommunists will split and destroy the
movement, and ‘

OThe'ir presence will give ammunition
to Reagan to attack it.

To support his argument, Rex cites the
-role of the Progressive Labor Party
(PLP) within the student movement of '
the 1960s. Those of us who were part of
that struggle can correct his inaccuracies.
Some of the most important mass stu-
dent struggles of the ’60s wereled by PLP
members’ in Students for a Democratic
Society (S DS), including major strikes at
Columbia" and Harvard Universities and

.’  ‘- San Francisco State College. Contrary to

what Rex says, PLP did not “force inter-
nal dissent” within SDS butbuilt itinto a
major force on many campuses. It was

- tic sects (and police infiltrators) who

  Abortion Controversy Should Not End

sought to ‘split the group and who left
SDS in 1969.

Dear Editor:

I am writing in response to the letter about
the abortion controversy, written by Car-
men Furfaro, which appeared ‘on the Opin-
ion page of . The Pitt News on Friday, March
4, 1983.

In her letter, Miss Furfaro concludes that

the abortion controversy should end, 4
“because 10 years of controversy has caused _

nothing to change the Supreme Court
decision.”

In response to this letter, I would like to
make severalpoints and observations. Miss
Furfaro states, in her letter, that “The public
has-demonstrated that it does not want the
law changed.” This is an incorrect and mis-
leading statement in several respects. First of
all, we are dealing with a decision which,

while it smacks ofjudicial legislation, is not a”

law passed by elected representatives.
Secondly, there has been attempt after
attempt to alter or restrict thisudecision since
its announcement in 1973." Most have been
struck down by the courts after having
passed the legislatures, and several now sit
before‘ ﬁle Supreme Court (includingthe
recently passed Pennsylvania Abortion

Control Law) awaiting pronouncement. Is

Far from a “demise,” SDS continued

activity for another three years, including
struggles against academic racists (such
as Jensen, Herrnstein and Shockley) and
‘large demonstrations at the 1972 Demo-
cratic and Republican Conventions.
While Weathermen crazies went under-
ground, PLP and SDS continued open,
activities. ‘ .

PLP worked with SDS, as it does now

with other organizations, because we
‘want to win many workers and students
to Communist ideas. In the current
period, the U.S. and Soviets are moving
closer to World War III as millions of
workers feel the effects of world eco-
nomic depression-. Students at Pitt are
realizing that they, too, are not immune
to these effects, as unemployment is
likely to meet them on graduation.

While capitalism (whether the U.S.,

Soviet or Chinese variety) means exploi-
tation, depression and death to workers,
Communism means egalitarianism; an
end to the wage system that is the basis of
capitalist society. Workers have no real
rights under capitalism, and “civil liber— ‘
ties” are meaningless to laid-off workers,
deported foreign-born or victims of the
daily disease and suffering of this society. '

this evidence that the public does not want
the “law” changed?

To support her views, Miss Furfaro
makes several allusions to and accusations
about “highly vocal pro-life groups.” I
notice that thesereferences are conspicu-
ously general, devoid of specific examples,
support or statistics. She does attempt to use
a declaration of support by the League of
Women Voters, to which she refers as “a
reflection of public opinion.” (?!) However,
this reference is misleading in that it implies
that all 1 10,000 league board members voted
unanimously in favor of a pro-choice posi-
tion, when I’m positive that is not the case.‘

She seems to come to the conclusion that
because public opinion has favored one side
of an issue and because nothing has changed
over the course of 10 years, the controversy
should be concluded. There are several
problems with this conclusion. When the
court handed down its I973 decision, it went
against public opinion in that it struck down
laws, in almost all of the 50 states, that re-
stricted abortion. Miss Furfaro herself states
that, “the Supreme Court [not the public]

has given the choice to the women.” Also,
the proposed Hatch Amendment, which

would effectively take the issue of abortion

Communists in the PLP want no part
of the “nuclear freeze” movement. This is

. a phony peace movement led primarily

by the Democratic Party to subvert true
anti-war sentiment in a “safe” direction ‘
to givetime for the U.S. to arm itself for
both conventional and nuclear war. We
see that the only alternative is to abandon
the electoral system and build -a mass
movement among students, workers and
soldiers to refuse participation in impe- A
rialist war. Our.members in the armed
services are organizing for mass deser-
tions and rebellions against war orders.
Ultimately, armed revolution will emerge
from war and develop the basis for a new
society free of depression and war.

Any movement that is a perceived
threat to the capitalist class will be
attacked, and a movement that is not
slandered" by the rulers, their media or
their lackey politicians is no threat to .
them at all. Therefore, we welcome the B
attacks of the capitalist class,.and we will
answer them with the wrath of the work-

‘ ing class.

out of the courts and put it into hands of the

public through the Congress and state legis- .

latures, has been vehemently opposed by the
pro-choice movement. ‘

Also, I question the validity of relying on
opinion as the determinant for ending con-
troversy. For example, in Nazi Germany,

what would public opinion have said about ‘

the status of Jews? Or, in pre-Civil War
America (and even in post-Civil War Amer-
ica), what would public opinion have said
about the status of blacks? There is clearly
something more to this ‘issue than public
opinion. Perhaps a notion of right and
wrong, apart from the majority position,
comes into play? Miss Furfaro only scrapes
the surface here and completely ignores the
many complex biological and philosophical
facets of this controversial issue.

. The fact is that abortion is and ‘will con-
tinue to be a controversial issue for some

' _time to come.

Rights of
Suspects
Listed

The following information has been
excerpted from an American Civil Liber-
ties Union (ACLU) ' handbook, The
Rights of Suspects by Oliver Rosengart.’

Q.’ What if you refuse to submit to a
stop and frisk? A

A. Failing to submit to a stop and frisk
could result in an arrest. Although your
conduct may have been lawful, or only
suspicious (anyone out very late at night
may be suspicious to some police) a mild
, resistance to authority could lead to a‘,
lawful arrest. '

Q. Do the same general limits apply to
police behavior during roadblocks? ‘

A. The roadblock is another form of

ing criminals. All vehicles on the road are
stopped. and searched and the occupants

may have seen etc.

Q. When are the police permitted to
search persons on the street?

A. When a lawful arrest has been made
and it is believed that the arrestee com-
mitted the crime; with a search warrant;
or with the free and voluntary consent of
the person being searched.

Q. What should a citizen ‘do when
being questioned by the police?

A. Most lawyers agree that it is best to
say nothing other than your name and
address. It is not easy for the average

citizen to resist giving some kind of state-
ment. The police are sometimes-skilled '
interrogators; many have learned tech-

niques for “opening people up."

Generally, one should never believe a
promise or a threat made by a policeman."

If you have been issued. your Miranda
warning and are being interrogated, and
the police" have some evidence against
you, you will not be able to talk yourself
out of an arrest no matter what you say."
Even if you are innocent, and have_an
ironclad alibi, you are better off disclos-
ing the information at a later time, after
you and your lawyer have been able to
check it out and make sure your witness
remembers. Remember too, that your
refusal to answer any questions cannot be
held against you in any way later on, but

ment can be used against- you at trial.

The Pitt News, Monday March 14, 1933

By COLETTE FERRIS

Why do couples brwk up? Dick.
Purnell knows, and he brought his
knowledge of human relationships

' to Pitt last week.

Purnell, whowas inivited here by
the Campus Crusade for Christ,
gave two lectures that dealt with
couples’ intimate relationships. Last

_ ' Monday, approximately 75 students
~ gathered in Benedum Auditorium to

‘hear the parting tale of the couple in
a speech entitled “Why do couples
break up?”

Purnell started his speech by ask-
ing the audience to remember two
“great assumptions.” I

“Men, you really believe that all
women think like men——they don’t.
Women, you think men think like
you, and they don’t,” he said.

Then Purnell continued, explain-
ing that women are global in their
thinking—all the incidents in their
lives connect, where men are com-
partmental thinkers—all aspects of
their lives are divided into sections

' (such as sports, job, girls etc.).

Purnell divided the causes of a
breakup into three categories. First,

Purnell said that society is oriented
toward pulling us apart. He gave
such examples as television taking
the place of communication, recrea-
tional variances and going to
college.

The second category was what he
called “the measuring stick theory.”

“Since we are a society that is self-
centered, we care about our own
satisfaction and can never be fully
satisfied,” he said. “We have a con-
stant tendency to compare and
scope—always looking for what we
don’t have.”

The third category is the broken
dream in which the preconceived
image of the person isn’t met.

“I feel it is a rotten shame,” Pur-
nell said, “that just because people
don’t fit ideal images, they aren’t
given a chance. Remember, the bal-
ance between good qualities and bad
is always constant.” ' .

According to Purnell, men gener-
ally get these perfect images from
magazines. What they don’t realize
is that the models get hundreds of
pictures taken of them and that these
pictures are air brushed.

Using a humorous, yet ﬁrm, tone,
Purnell had the audience's undi-

Society Pulls Couples Apart

vided attention and filled the audito-
rium with laughter on several
occasions. ,

Purnell believes that the 50/50
relationship just does not work. The
reason this type of relationship is
ineffective is because one of the 50
believes that-he is contributing more
than his share. _

Purnell suggested that couples
keep Jesus Christ as a stable factor
in their relationships.

“God is love and he displayed his
love by sending his only begotten to
-die -for our sins—our selfishness,”
Purnell said. .

After attending college, Purnell,
who acquired degrees in couselling
and zoology, set outron a medical
career. However,» he immediately
changed his priorities after becom-
ing a marriage counsellor and seeing
many couples struggle.

Purnell decided to quit his coun-
selling job and dedicate his life to
helping college students all over the
country. Last year, he gave lectures
at 30 campuses across the country.

‘‘I am reaching out to college stu-
dents,” he said, “letting them know
that there is an alternative to what
they are experiencing.”

  Be Summer Housing

By ANN WALKER .

Holland Hall may be the new
housing site for students who will be
attending spring and summer ses-
sions said Bob Robinson, the assist-
ant to the director of Housing and
Food Services. '

Tower C, the dorm which has

been used in the_ past, has not been‘

renovated in four years, and this
summer it is scheduled for renova-
tion. During the summer months,
the dorms are cleaned, painted and
any structural damage is repaired.

“Tower C has been neglected in
the past four years,” Robinson said,
“it needs a complete overhaul,
includirig having the air condition-
ing system looked at and air ﬁlters in
the air ducts cleaned.”

Although a deﬁnite decision on
whether Holland will be used has
not been made, there are several fac-
tors that make it a likely candidate,
Robinson said. It houses 591 ‘stu-
dents, making it the largest dorm,
and it "is the most structurally

' undamaged building.

_ “Holland Hall is the best kept
dorm. We’ intend to keep it inthe
shape it’s in regardless if we house

he said.

Lothrop was used five years ago, ,_

but is notbeing considered this year

becauseof all the heavy construction .'

in that area. The next large/st buil-
ding is Tower -A, which also needs a
lot of renovating.

‘ “Another factorthat makes Hol-
land a good -choice for housing is
that it would take very little time to
have it ready for the spring session,”
Robinson said. “Classes begin very
soon after the end of the term and
Holland wouldn’t need too much

. work to get it cleaned, and
renovated."

Although the bathrooms in Hol- 
. land do not have on-the-wall urinals
that could accommodate men,-
" Robinson said that is not a problem.

“There aren’t any urinals in my
home and it accommodates both
men and women," he said.

The bathrooms will be cleaned
daily so sanitation is not a problem

Each ﬂoor will house a singlesex
and possibly the center door in Hol-

ration between the two sexes but

Robinson said the whole idea is
still in the planning stagesbecause
his office wants to look at all the
possible sources of housing. He said
the decision will be made in a couple
of weeks.

Return 

By CHARLIE C'HARA

When the Panther track team left
for its ﬁnal meet of the indoor sea-

V son, the NCAA Indoor Track and

Fieldichampionships, Thursday, the
goal was to return with six All
Americas.

The team didn’t return with six,
but it did get four+the two mile
relay team of Darren-Geary, Bill
Moorhead, Garland, Brown and
Terry Gallagher placed fifth
(7:26\.50), gaining All-America sta-
tus. The top six finishers in each

Villanova’s time of 7:21.90 estab— . -

.Wildcats held off Arizona State_
(7:23.37) for the title. .
The Panthers entered the meet
with two other individual qualifiers;

  Gymnasts Tumble
At Penn State    6

By JAMES R.A. SROCK

Penn State has a, great tradition in
gymnastics. It traditionally has
enthusiastic crowds that adore the
sport. It traditionally has expert
judging and coaching. But most of
all, Penn State has a great tradition
of winning.

It was a familiar scene for Frank
D’Amico, coach of the Panther
gymnastics team. Time after time, he

6 has made the trek to Happy Valley

and come back with a not-so-happy
smile.

This Saturday night, however,
D’Amico’s frown was not as wide.

‘ The Panthers took last in a three-

 

 .a “score 0

way meet, but they displayed one of l

the best showings ever against the
Nittany squad.

The tri-meet featured some of the
nations best gymnasts. Penn State
placed first with a 276.95 followed
by Southern Illinois University with
a 275.25 and Pitt with 266.15.

“Other schools such as Syracuse
and Southern Conneticut ‘didn't
score as well as we .did at Penn
State,” D’Amico said. “That score
could be an indication ofhow strong
we actually are in the East.”

The Panthers had few highlights
to focus upon, for onlyifour of them
managed to place. '

Junior Dave Smith took second
on the floor exercise with a score of
9.45. Senior side—horse specialist’
Mike ‘Teke‘ ‘Lloyd placed ﬁfth with
f 8.95 "I

    

n,theAall_-,around,_ , _futu__re. , V ,

 

two Panthers compiled respectful,
scores. Senior Frank Kratz finished
with a score of 53.65, which was

‘good enough for a fourth, and fresh-

'man Mark Klafter finished fifth with
a 52.25.

D’Amico said that one of the spe-
cial aspects of travelling to Penn
State is its avid fans.  .

“I thought the crowd was very
admirable and receptive,” D’Amico
said. “They were very eager to see
gymnastics, and everyone was well
applauded after his routine."

Even though the Panthers once
again came up short against their
intrastate rivals, D’Amico was
pleased with the outcome.

“We still need a finer texture like

Penn State, but I think we did very
well,” he said;

D’Amico is optimistic that the
Panthers will finish second "in the

‘East——-the best the team has ever

‘done.

“The East has twice as many
schools than any other region in the
country,” D’Amico explained. “And
although our average will not be
enought to qualify us as a team for
‘nationals, we hope to qualify several
individuals."

Smith has already qualified for
NCAAs on the floor exercise. Many
other gymnasts are_ on the brink of
qualification.

“They [Penn State] complimented
Pitt on our improved program,"
D’Amico said. “But we’ll come back
to haunt them someday."- -

Hopefully, for D’Amico’s’ sake,
Panther ghosts will be haunting

Can Davis Aid. Pitt Track   

Sports Column,
By BARRY ZASLOFF

He could wrap an entire track’
program around his legs and
carry it to national prominence.
Call it The Clinton Davis
Express. lts motto: All aboard
for the fastest race to fame in the
history of wheels. In short, it’s
life in the fast lane. Hop on The
Davis Express and ride it to the
top of collegiate track.

But the opening of The Davis
Express will be delayed until
after the 1984 Olympics. Elbert
Kennedy, Davis’ coach from the
New Image Track Club, recently
said that the Steel Valley senior
will attend either Pitt or Villa-
nova for oneyear, participate in

the Olympics and then will most
likely transfer to another univer-
sity on a track scholarship. He
will spend his first year of eligi-
bility preparing for the Olympics
rather than sprinting into the
national limelight. "

Here, an interesting question -
surfaces. Can Clinton Davis help
a track program without ever
stepping foot on its oval in com-
petition? Will the mere affiliation
of the name Davis with Pitt or
Villanova help to secure top
name recruits? ' ' -

The scenario reads like this:

.1t’s the 1984 Millrose Games,
and Clinton Davis struts onto
the wood surface at Madison
Square Garden. The introduc-

tion is made—from the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, Clinton
Davis. - 2
Sounds great. In fact, down— ,
right impressive. But then comes
reality——Davis‘-venture to the
Big Apple is solely for the pur-
pose of self-competition. Davis
would represent Pitt like Billy
Carter represented Jimmy's best
interests. He would be from Pitt
in the sense of one year of educa-
tion rather than a year of some-
thing equivalent to Blazing
Saddles. He would be a kid look-
ing to smash Millrose records for
the sake of Clinton Davis‘, not for
the advancement of the Pitt track
program. The only load he'd be
carrying on his legs would be
self-inﬂicted, a strong desire. to

The season has ended abruptly for
the Panther basketball team and
thus it’s award time. The first annual
Dave Gavitt awards—named after
the genius who. has led the young
league into the ranks of the Atlantic
Coast Conference and the South-
eastern’ Conference—will be pres-
ented to the worthy Big East schools
while the Cas Trophy——named after
the previous Pitt athletic director-
will be given to Pitt players and
opponents outside the Big East.

First, the Gavitt awards:
All-Big East team:

Forward Clyde Vaughan, Pitt, '

Forward Ed Pinckney, Villanova,

Center John Garris, Boston
College,

Guard Michael Adams, Boston
College, _

Guard Chris’ Mullin, St. John‘s.

All-Rookie team:

Rookie of the Year: Jackson,

Co-Players of the Year: Mullin

Coach of the Year: Gary Willi-

Year: Roy Chipman, Pitt. Consider g

the Big East without a center and
only one legitimate score.

Surprise Team: Boston College.
The Eagles used to be known as
“Bounce pass U.,”a team that would

throw as many as 44 passes before‘

shooting. Now, Boston College is
one of the highest scoring teams in
the nation. '

Most Overrated Team: George-

Most Overrated Player: Patrick
Ewing, Georgetown. In two years,
he will be in a class with the best men

And then there were 52 . . . . The
NCAA- yesterday announced a field

of 52 teams that will battle their way i

to the illustrious “Final Four” in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, from
which one will-emerge as national
champion for 1983. There used to be
32, one more than Baskin-Robbins
can boast, until college basketball
began realizing big television
numbers and the chosen few grew
and grew, first to 40, then 48 and
now, 52. _

South Carolina didn’t make it this
year, neither did independents Notre
Dame and DePaul, but surprisingly,‘
Rutgers did, along with five teams

The Pitt News, Monday March 14,1983

Ten conferences. West Virginia and _

Robert Morris will both be return-
ing to the tournament this year, but
Pitt will not. Big East commissioner
and chief “team-picker” for- the
NCAA Dave Gavitt managed to dig
deep into his pockets, pulling out
five Big East teams, three of which
are seeded in their respective
regions. The Panthers’ bid was
tucked away in his socks, and uncov-
ering it would have let off a stink to
curdle Al McGuire’s wit.

What follows are the clouded
observations of how the four region-
als shape up:

EAST: In the» A.W. (after
Wooden) era of college basketball,
the East has been thought of as the

V toughest"of the four regionals, and

until Jim Valvano’s N.C. State
Wolfpack dined on ACC leaders N.
Carolina and Virginia for weekend
brunch, that theory held true." Now
that the mighty have fallen, Louie
Carnesecca and his St. J ohn’s Red-
men sit pretty as the No. 1 seed here.
North Carolina gets to unpack their
bags and play down the road in
Greensboro instead of out west.

These two have to be considered the

favorites in the East regional, but
don’t be surprised to see the Orange-
men of Syracuse in a Big East dual
with Louie's boys. When two confer-
ence mates square off, well, record
books ﬂy like pigeons etc., etc.
Besides, Syracuse looked hungry at
the Garden and hasjust been handed
a second life. I see a Syracuse-North

MIDEAST: Brimming with big
names, the Mideast will probably
give us the tournament’s biggest sur-
prises. Robert Morris finds itself in a
field of giants headed by Kentucky,
Indiana and Louisville. Traditions
aside, none of these teams is playing
its best ball of the season so the
upsets could come in bunches. Still,
I can't shakethe memories of Ken-
tucky’s early season performances in
which they were often mistaken for
the Lakers; the Wildcats still have
the potential to blow any team in the
country out the air ducts. Whichever

. giant finds its tournament feet first

could be difficult to catch. Kentucky

MIDWEST: Houston, the hottest
team in the country, gets to play at
home against the likes of Tennesee-
Chattanooga and Lamar. Who’s
going to bet against them? I will.
Lamar has been the" proverbial gnat
in the eyes of college basketball’s
biggest powers, and Villanova,
another displaced Easterner, is due
to get angry on somebody. The Big
East has Georgetown here also, and

accomplish more at a collegiate
level than he did,in highlschool.

This is not exactly an easy feat.
If Davis performs half as well as
he has in the past, he’1lsti1g_be one
of the nation’s top sprinters. This
is a kid ’ who owns _national
records in just about every
sprinting event categorized. He
could raise the level of any track
program for which he competes.
In short, he could do for track

what Tony Dorsett did for Pitt

football.

But not at Pitt. The, name
Davis isn't enough; it would take
his rocket-like legs. If anything,
the fact that Davis would be
attending Pitt and notﬁrunning
for the track team would hurt the

Panthers’ chanc_es of building its
program.

The world of track is small,
one in which many of the top
recruits know each other. They’ll
know Clinton Davis before his
name is announced at the Mill-
rose Games. They’ll know Davis
is runningfor himself rather than
the Panther track team. And
they’ll wonder why he is shun-
ning the Pitt program. It’s not
exactly the kind of situation that
would have high school seniors
drooling to race to Pitt.

It could hurt Pitt down the
road, too. Davis will most likely
attend Pitt for a year, take him-
self, his two legs and his records

to the Olympics and then
transfer to an established track
school. He has expressed a fond-
ness for UCLA; which appar-
ently has everything he wants:
good running weather, a long list
of top-caliber sprinters and some
of his relatives in the vicinity.
The scene won’t prompt pro-
spective freshmen to break down
the field house doors. Davis, it
would be known, used Pitt as a
training ground to -prepare for
the Olympics and" then snubbed
his nose at the attempts to keep
him at Pitt. He'd be remembered

as the best sprinter ever to leave _
Pitt running.‘

‘And 'he’d leave without even
giving a trial run of The Davis
Express. '

Ping-Pong F

Sports Column
By JEFFREY vounc;

On Feb. 18, 1983, the 65th annual _
American College Union Interna-

tional (ACUI) tournament was held
at West Virginia University. Over 40
colleges were represented, with Pitt
being one of the largest schools to
send participants. There are about
20 sports in this intercollegiate tour-
nament. The University of Pitts-
burgh sent‘ representatives for
two—table tennis and bowling.
The reason for the low representa-

’ tion by Pitt is a-lack of funding. Pitt

was the only school that would not
monetarily support its athletes.
Christine Chergi, assistant director

. of the Pitt Student Union, said that a

change in the budget caused the ter-
mination of funds that once were
provided.

In the past, Pitt had provided for

the sport oftable tennis. It even pro-
duced a national champion—~Perry
Schwarzberg. A
The Pitt athletic department
spends million of dollars on football
and basketball but _won’t provide

' $100 ($25 entry fee and $75 for trans-

portation, lodging and food
expenses) for participation in inter-
collegiate competition.

Chergi said that the reason for the
termination of sponsorship is that
Pitt reclassified table tennis from a
sport to a recreation. How can one
possibly reclassify an official Olym-
pic sport as a recreation? There is
obviously something wrong here at
Pitt.

Pitt has what is probably one of
the top five table tennis teams in the
country. Top players include Ben
Neisbet, Lance False and Dan
Miller. Neisbet, ranked among the

unds Tabled  

top five collegiate players in the
country, is upset with the university.
Citing this tournament as a major
contributing factor, he has chosen
not to return to Pitt next year. If
there had” been funds provided,
Neisbet would have played in the
ACUI tournament, and the univer-
sity might have won the doubles and
single titles. I

The major idea here is to point out
that table tennis is an official Olym-
pic_sport. There should be some allo-
cation of funds to these athletes who
represent our school. When the team
produced a first-place finish at the
ACUI tournament, Pitt got a plaque
to display. The players gave recogni-
tion to Pitt by wearing Pitt clothing
throughout the tournament.

Ironically, it was a tournament in
which Pitt refused to support its
athletes.

Eh: jﬂitt News

By MARK COLLINS

If she wanted, Toni Morrison could
collect titles—both unofficial and
official— with the "same regularity as
royality checks. In fact, the income

from best sellers like Song of Solomon,

andTar Baby can only supplement
titles Morrison garnered long before
her recent success: Teacher. Parent.

‘Black. And Writer.

Shebegan in _1962 in a small’ wri-
ter's group at her alma mater, How-
ard University. It wasn't until 1970,
however, thatyher first novel, The Blu-
est Eye, was published by Holt, Rine-
hart, and Winston. The book, which

sold modestly compared to her later

 Toni Morrison Headlines Conference
 in success, was nonetheless critically

acclaimed.

What brought notice to
Morrison——and remains her most
distinctive stylistic feature—was a
fresh use of language and her raw,
mythical characters and themes.

The Bluest Eye—the story of a black
girl's desire for ”pretty blue eyes”—
has little straight narrative. Instead,
Morrison alternates characters, point
of view, past and present—all with
riveting effect:

”The soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers.
Certain seeds it will not nurture, certainfruit

it will not bear, and when the land kills ofits‘
own volition, we acquiesce and say the victim .

/

 

Toni Morrison

had no right to live. We are wrong, of course,
but it doesn't matter. It's too late. At least on
the edge of my town, among the garbage and
the sunflowers of my town, it's m_uch, much,
much too late." ' i
_——The Bluest Eye

It's a novel, the author says, about a
”fragmented life, (with) a disjointed
quality." Different techniques, she

says, are adapted to each novel/

because ”each book demands some-

thing else.” .
The style of The Bluest Eye is radi-

cally different from her latest novel,

Tar Baby. For instance, Tar Baby ha
far more dialogue, Morrison says
' continued on page two . ‘ "

 

 

‘ By CHR .

 

Writer Susan Sheehan is what
most working people would consider
a "night owl.” She has been known to
stay awake until the wee hours of the
morning working on a book or maga-
zine article. She developed her late-

; night habit while attending school at

Wellsley, and it has stuck with her
ever since.

A staff writer for The New Yorker
since 1962, Sheehan is best known
for her in-depth look at seemingly
ordinary people living extra-ordinary
lives. People such as welfare mothers,
prisoners and mental patients.

_Her latest book, Is There No Place On
Earth For Me?, won the National Men-
tal Health Association Award for the
vivid portrayal of paranoid schizoph-
renic Sylvia Frumkin.

Sheehan says the research for the
book was not easy; she just couldn't
walk into a mental hospital and begin
jotting notes. She says that she had to
be choosy about the institution‘ in
which she would find her subject. She
picked Creedmoor Psychiatric Cen-

ter in Manhattan because New York

State has a reputation of being nice to
New Yorker writers and because the
administration of the ‘hospital
seemed genuinely interested in help-

~ _ ing her.

The second step was to find some-

one to watch, become friends with,"

and ultimately, be the subject of her
book.

"I knew I was looking for a schi-
zophrenic because they are the most
common and the least treatable,” she
says. "I was also looking for a woman

‘because it would be easier; they are ‘

Sheehan said the unit director at
Creedmoor told her about Frumkin
(not her real name), a schizophrenic
who had recently been releasednfrom

the hospital. "

Several weeks later, Frumkin was
back at Creedmoor following a sui-
cide attempt, and that is where 15

records, she was on the ward taking
notes of the patient’s monologues

and sometimes even sleeping in the-

bed next to her whenever she was
hopitalized.

By showing her readers what it
was like being a patient, Sheehan also
wanted to show what mental hospi-
tals in general are like. Sheehan des-

because the characters are creatures
of the 1980s. "The 19803, she says,
"are more chatty, (but) not necessar-
ily more articulate."

Between The Bluest Eye and Tar Baby,
Morrison reinforced her critical fol-

«lowing with increasing popularity.
_,Following The Bluest Eye was Sula

for the National Book Award; and

Song of Solomon (Knopf, 1977), winner"

of the National Book Critics Circle

But in gathering a growing reader-
ship, Morrison feared being stereo-
typed as a certain "kind" of novelist.
Some people, she says, "expect each

book to be exactly like the one Idid 

before...it’s not interesting to write
the same thing, (but) a discovery for
me to find out, with each book, prob-

_ lems to be solved, (and to) imagine a

world you haven't lived in, with peo-
ple you haven't met.”

"...with people you haven't met.”
It's these strong vibrant people of her

novels that often seem to control the -
' story. "I write for the people in my _

‘books...They're always over my
shoulder, saying, 'That line isn't
right,’ or 'OK,’ " she says. It seems at
times that characters dominate the

narrative more than the author.‘

Sometimes, Morrison says, "you
expect them to do something and the

characters don't seem cooperative.

They begin to come alive, take over-
...that is ‘~when you need restraint,

control.”

As a teacher, though, Morrison is
not prone to advise ”restraint" or
"control". Young writers, she says,
should "unlearn bad habits...feel
freer, more aggressive...than what
we have now (in fiction).”

A former lecturer at Yale and Bard
College, she chooses to teach litera-
ture courses and "Techniques in Fic-
tion" instead of creative writing ("I
couldn't describe how toextend a
vision” . Her favorite authors-

authors she r_ecommends—are wri-A

ters whose "books can't be written by
anyone else," such as Eudora Welty,
John Gardner and Gabriel Garcia
Marquez. Her admiration "has more
to do with style and world-view than
just (putting) one word in front of
another."

But the critical acceptance of these
authors -has not mimicked her own.
Despite favorable reviews and
numerous awards, her success seems
to have created a sometimes-uneasy
relationship between author and
critic. One review called her.charac-
tuers "unrepresentative"_ of Blacks
and her fiction "brutal."

"I don't know exactly what that
means...Beowulf is brutal. (So is)
Flannery O'Connor." It's a criticism
that has remained, she says, because
"the association of blacks with the
brutal life seems excessive”-—a con-
sideration, she argues, which is out-
side the realmeof literature.

If her stories have violent ele-
ments, it is "a different kind of bruta-
lity...I’m preoccupied, with people

cribes the atmosphere at Creedmoor
as "depressing" because of the type of
illnesses that are treated there.

"I think Creedmoor was shown for
what it is," she says, "pretty lousy
living conditions.”

Although the experience was one
that she will never "forget, Sheehan
says she would not be too eager to
venture into the subject again.

"It was ‘extemely anguishing and
depressing," she says. "You find that
you can't change anything. I learned
that it's the worst thing that can
happen—to lose your mind."

Dr. Cleon Comes, the medical »

director of the schizophrenic pro-
gram at Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic, says Sheehan did a good
job describing the schizophrenic
Frumkin. ' . ' .

"I thought it was accurate," he
says. "She is very genuine in her con-
cern of the chronic mental patient. I
think the book had an impact on the
public’s ‘thoughts of the chronic
patient."

At the end of Is There No Place On
Earth For 'Me.7, Frumkin is finally

released from Creedmoor to start liv- -

ing a "normal" life free from hospi-
tals. Sheehan says she hears from

.Frumkin every now and then and she

is doing quite well on her own.

Sheehan was born in Vienna, Aus-
tria, and moved to the United States
with, her parents when she was four
years old. She attended Hunter

New York known for its academics,
and graduated from Wellsley with a

cumstances. I don't write books on
models and conventional characters.”

Yet other labels have stuck. Wri-
ters such as John Updike and John
Cheever are called/'foremost Ameri-
can novelists;" for Morrison, how-
ever, the title -is often a "foremost
black woman novelist." It's a descrip-
tion like that, Morrison says, "I res-
ent when I think it's diminishing. But
both labels (woman and black) are
real...Most of the time, though, it's
meant as limiting." -

It's the ‘popularity of her latest
novels—in sociology courses, critic
circles and. bool<stores—that now
provide Morrison with free time. Her
present success allows her to work
fewer hours as senior editor at Ran-
dom House and devote more time to
writing.

It is an unusual change for Toni
Morrison. The mother of two sons,
time was once her enemy. She began
writing, she says, because "I was not
happy, (and) I was the sole supporter
of two children...I wrote after the
children were asleep, as a way of
ordering‘ the universe." '

Although her sons are now grown,
time may still be stalking her: "I have
the illusion of more time...l don't
have the parental responsibilitiesas I
once did," she says, "but writing is

zines, she became a permanent fix-
ture at The New Yorker in 1962. She
says she became interested in jour-
nalism late in life because she was too
intimidated in collegeto write, so, she
just fell into the field later on.

Most of the ideas that she has come
up with for books and articles have
been from newspapers and maga-
zines. She calls herself a "newspaper
junkie." The more she reads about a



subject, the more interested she

becomes in pursuing it further. That
is how her second book, A Welfare
Mother, published in .1976, came
about. I ’
’’I’d read - stories about welfare
recipients and see that some were
driving around in Cadillacs, while
others were starving," she explains.
”One day I just wanted .to go out and
find out by myself." _
She wanted, to describe life on wel-
fare through the firsthand expe-
rience of a recipient. However, she
did not want to go through the state

welfare bureaucracy to find a subjec"t:(n

Finally, she found a social worker
who had a good rapport with a
woman fictiously named "Carmen
Santana." I

Sheehan said she hears from San-
tana when she is able to track her
down and that the last time they com-
municated, Santana was "still cheat-

ing _and living on welfare very,

happily."

In The New York Times Book Review,
reviewer Susan Jacoby expressed
doubt about Sheehan's ability to‘
relate to a welfare mother because

Sheehan lives the life of an upper-("

middle class writer. Sheehan shrugs
off that criticism.

"I’m much more interested in peo-
ple who are different from me than

those similar to me. I feel that I can fit V
rightain even if we are different," she '

remarks. v

Her next book, published in 1978,
focused on the life of George
Malinow, a 57-year-old man who was
serving a prison term for robbery. A
Prison and A Prisoner took an inside look
at prisons and prisoners’ minds as
Sheehan traced the day—to-day life of
Malinov.

The book was researched in Green
Haven, a maximum security prison
80 miles north of New York City.

At the time, Malinov had already
spent all but three of the past 39 years
behind bars and called himself a "pro-
fessional criminal." Sheehan says he
was the’ perfect subjectbecause he
was guilty, and that was exactly what
she was looking for. _

Although . she ‘has been called a
"new journalist" by some, Sheehan

claims the opposite is true.

"New journalism is flashy style and
putting yourself in the work," she
explains. "People associate new jour-
nalism with Tom Wolfe. I think it's
pretty garish; I like to be invisible, sol
always write in the third person."

Sheehan says she could not reveal
what she is currently working on for
The New _Yorker.because she doesn't
want the word to leak out. She did
say, however, that she is also work-
ing on a biography about Alfred

ficulties, challenges and responsibili-
ties of being a writer and offer tips to

Ignatow Wants More
Poetry Study

By MICHAEL RECTENWALD

In an age where specialization and
technology seem to have taken over
the minds of young people scram-
bling for jobs, the study of poetry is
often neglected. Poet David Ignatow,
a Keynote speaker at this year's Wri-
ter’s Conference, feels that this is an
injustice, but one which can be reme-
died: ”Bring more poetsinto the sys-
tem,” he says. .

Ignatow reflected on the educa-
tional system in America, especially
with regardsto poetry, saying, ”It’s
not the fault of the language that
many people do not understand poe-
try, but of a lack of education among
the people. The system is too special-
ized. A person has to concentrate on a
field which is all—absorbing, leaving
him unable to appreciate other
things.” '

Ignatow sees this intensive special-
ization as a problem even within Eng-
lish departments, and feels that the
creative aspect is suffering because of

' it. ”We should see tovit that Ph.D.’s

get more training in contemporary
poetry," he says. ”Most are so cut and
dry. They keep a narrow focus for
most of their lives. They should come
into contact with living poets in con-
ferences before they get their
PhD.s.”

These are interesting comments,

indeed, coming from a__p_oet who

By SUE RUSSELL GELBURD

For Lorna Dee Cervantes, author
of the highly acclaimed collection of
poems, Emplumada (University of
Pittsburgh Press, 1981), poetry and
politics do mix. Cervantes started
writing when she was very young.—
eight years old, as she remembers—
but it was through an experience at
the age of 18 that she came to feel she
would be a poet. At that time she
traveled with a Chicano guerilla
theater group to a conference in
Mexico, where she was asked to give
a public poetry reading. The impact
this reading had on her audience
brought a realizationto Cervantes.
She began to see poetry as a living art
with the potential to bridge class dis-
tinctions and work as a political tool.»
As a young girl,‘ she had read the
work of dead poets, whatever she
could find in the library, but now she
would read the work of those who
were alive as well. ”Poetry," says Cer-
vantes, now in her late 203, ’’had poli-
ticized me.”

Cervantes grew up as a member of
a poor Chicano family in San Jose,
California, where she still lives, and
the experiences of her early years
color her work. She is grateful for the
strength and independence her fam-
ity and their way of life instilled in
her, as a result of which she now
manages to live on the meager
income of a poet with little complaint.
A college drop-out (”Institutional
education never suited me.”), she has

 

  
  

never received any formal college
education. On the" merit of his poetry,
Ignatow received teaching posts at
Columbia University and York Col-
lege, where he teaches poetry writ-
ing, literature, and remedial English.
He received his training by helping
his friends who were attending col-
lege. ”They brought me the agenda
for their courses and I went to the
library to find the books they needed

I

and studied right along with them,’ 4

he says. During this time he worked
at many and various jobs such as a
clerk, salesman, truck driver, copy-
boy, book-binder, and telegram deliv-
erer. Later he became the president
of a book—binding company.

With all of this experience, Ignatow
became very knowledgeable of the
business world, and it entered very
much into his poetry. Asked how he
reconciled business with poetry, he
says that ”the principle of money in
business has bee a subject of poetry
since the beginning of time. Look at
Wordsworth's sonnets on London,
Blake's sonnet on London, the poetry
of William Shakespeare, and of
course, the Bible.

In The Notebooks of David Ignatow, he
writes: ”There is something very
funny in the way I make money.
Bryan said, ‘You shall not crucify man
upon a cross of gold.’ I say man is
crucified on the dollar sign. He is the
contorted figure on the uprights.”

David Ignatow

In light of his own history, it is not
surprising that_Ignatow compels his
students to write from experience.
He says that ”Most students haven't
lived enough or read enough, so they
should write out what they feel about
themselves. Whatever they've lived
through, they should write about it
honestly and from the gut. They
should write about it vividly and spe-
cifically and _should make an occasion
from the situation.”

Ignatow feels that politics is well
within the range of poetry. Political
poetry, he says, ”has been done well
and has a tremendous power to
move. But it should be very personal,
from the net of the self which allows
certain things to enter and keeps
others out. The subject has to come
from the inner demands of the per-
son, and be seen through the eyes of

never relied on a university for sup-
port. Since 1976 she has technically
earned her living as a writer. She
taught herself to print, typeset, and
do design and lay-out, skills which

Lorna Dee Cervantes

enabled her to found the quarterly
journal Mango, which specializes in
Chicano literature. Her press also
prints chapbooks and 'broadsides'b_y

 

third world women. Cervantes earns

a small living through selling the‘

books she prints and giving readings.
In 1977 she accepted her last govern-

vment grant, feeling that this source

of income would become unreliable
and believing strongly in her need as
a poet ”to flex my muscles.”

The background that helped. to
breed in Cervantes many strengths
also brought with it a sense of separa-

- tion. As a poet with a fluent com-

mand of English, it seemed inevitable
that she would lose her’ Spanish and
thus remove herself from the com-
munity in which she was raised. But
she tried consciously to accept the
”tag” put on her from the outside as a
Chicano poet, feeling that her status
as an outsider would enrich her work.
Latin American literature is more
closely connected with song than
with the written word; consequently,
Cervantes considered .it‘ a personal
responsibility to make her own expe-
rience and that of the people with
whom she grew up ”the stuff of liter-
ature,” to struggle to reclaim lan-
guage as a source of power.’’ A poem

the individual." He noted that poets.
such as Robert Bly and Allen Gins-

berg ”have done it well. I contributed
too,” he adds. ’

He feels that a poet has to write
primarily for oneself, but adds that
”craft is of utmost importance, and

the poet must meet the standards of I

craft, then the poetry communicates

automatically. Craft and poetry are

one in the same thing. To emphasize
one over theother is a great mistake.

You have to get the right language to

have impact, and that's the craft."

Currently Ignatow is working on a 1

manuscript of new poems to be pub-

_lished. ”It's very difficult," he says,‘.

”I’ve been showing the poems to fel-
low poets and it's very confusing to
have such differnet perpectives come

together. But I'm enjoying the-

confusion.”

conflicts is ”Refugee Ship,” which is
printed face-to-face with the Spa-nish
in her book, raising the question of
which poem is the translation and
which the original, or are they both,
in a sense, translations?

Like wet cornstarch, I slide past my
grandmother's eyes. Bible at her side,
she removes her glasses. The pudding

Mama raised me without language.
I'm orphaned from my Spanish name.
The words are foreign, stumbling on
my tongue. I see in the mirror my
reflection: bronzed skin, black hair.

I feel I am a captive aboard the refugee

ship. The ship that will never dock. El
barco que nunca atraca.

The poetry that Cervantes reads
most frequently is poetry in transla-
tion, not only from Spanish but also

from such languages as Ukrainian"

and Czech. One poet she claims as a

major influence is Pablo Neruda,_

whom she ”started reading at sixteen
and never stopped.”

It is common to hear discussion
about whether a poet's work seems to

arise out of a personal urgency, to

need in some vital way to be written.
Cervantes’ work illustrates well this
sense of urgency, and talking to her
reinforces the centrality of poetry in

her life. She speaks of a yearning that A i

has driven her since she was very
young ”to have something yo_ureall_y
want to say and to say it.” ' _ '-

Cliff Maw   Experience

One Reporter
Who Doesn '1‘

Play It Safe

By MARY KANE

 

Clifford May isn't likely to ‘do
things the safe way.

He's risked being shot at by Ayatol-
lah supporters in Tehran and by
poachers in Zambia.

Upon his return to New York—a
marginally safer place——he edited Geo

V magazine while still in his 20s and

became one of the youngest editors at
The New York Times Magazine.

This story about the 32-year-old
Times reporter could stop right here——
there's not all that ‘much to do for an
encore—but this story has a twist.
Maygave all that up for a cityiside
reporter's positon at The Times.

For May, however, moving from
the magazine to the newsroom and
from editing to reporting doesn't
represent a step backward. Instead,
it's a chance for him to try his hand
again at two things he hasn't been
practicing lately: hard newswriting
and foreign reporting.

One leads to the other at The Times.

At this paper, it (cityside reporting)
is a necessary prerequisiteto going
abroad,” May said. "You work as a
city reporter here so you understand

I the workings of the paper on a daily

basis. The idea is toh-ave people here
who they can send abroad when they
need to and whose work they know.”
May is now working on his French
skills, another prerequisite he'll need
for going abroad. He was recently
named The Times West African bureau
chief.
he'll be in charge of reporting
on about 25 West African countries.
He said he's particularly excited
about the assignment because The
Times didn't have a bureau in West
Africa before. Reporting on West
Africa was done from other African
bureaus, "and it was like reporting on
Los Angeles from New York,” May
said.
Writing about Africa won't be new

to him. He wrote a Dec. 12, 1982
cover story for the magazine on
Africa called "Preservation for Profit:
New Strategies to Save Africa's Wild-
life," about people who believe the
last hopefor preserving the world's
wildlife is by finding a way to do it for
profit. .

In addition to Africa, May's
covered stories from the Soviet
Uniori, Northern Ireland, Mexico,
France, Iran and elsewhere as a rov-
ing correspondent for Hearst news-
papers and a stringer for CBS radio
news.

The Soviet Union was difficult to
cover, he said, because of its strict
rules. Soviet citizens are forbidden to
talk to reporters, for example.

Reviewing A Literary Life

 
_ By FRANK DIGIACOMO

Thank God for trash cans. Not just
any run-of-the‘ mill waste contain-
ers, but the two battered ones, with
huge "108" 's painted hurriedly on
their galvinized sides, that stood in

I‘ front of Mel Watkins’ Manhattan

apartment complex. If it weren't for
these two numbered receptacles
marking the archway of an otherwise
addressless building, Watkins’ home
would have been just another ano-
nymous part of the grey New York
skyline. Instead, these trash cans give
the only clue that an editor of The New
York Times Book Review resided here.
Trudging up the stairs of Watkins’
apartmentbuilding is like wandering
onto the set of a Martin Scorsese
movie: the halls are dark, the paint is

yellowed, and the stairs creak with '

New York age. Somewhere on the
third floor, a stereo is pulsing the
heavy bassline of funk music—that is
Watkins’ apartment.

For those unfamiliar with Mel
Watkins, first a little background. He
is one of seven Preview Editors for
The New York Times Book Review—a
position he has held for 19 years. He
is originally from Youngstown, Ohio,
a city best known for its phenomenal
unemployment rate, where he gradu-
ated from South High_S_chool. This
weekend Watkins will return west,

stown, to ‘attend Pitt's Seventh
Annual Writers’ Conference and par-
ticipate in a seminar entitled "The
New York Times Experience."
Watkins attended Colgate Univer-
sity where he majored in fine arts
history with minors in philosophy
and creative writing. At Colgate, he
thought he might enter the field of
art as a painter until his love of writ-
ing and some guidance from his
adviser changed his mind. "He read a
novel of mine,” he reminisces, "And
after reading it said that if he were
me, he would stick to writing and give
up art. It was smart advice.” _
Graduating from college in 1962,
Watkins was advised, that if. he
wanted to write, his best bet would be
to get a completely unrelated job so
he could pound the typewriter at
night. He joined the federal govern-
ment, in the Social Security branch as
an examiner, but within a year was
"bored almost to death.” He decided
to find a new job, and landed one, as a
copyboy for The New York Times.
Within the year, Watkins was writing
for the paper. _
"At the time, The New York Times
allowed people who worked in the
clerk and copyperson positions to
move up. In fact, they encouraged
them to write," he says, "It turned
out that some of the editors liked the
stuff I was doing and gave me several

tion manager's position which,
although I was -in the same salary
range as the editors,...I was working
in terms of production with the
typesetters."

Eventually, Watkins became dis-
satisfied with his production .posi-
tion, 'and was ready to leave the
paper. Concidentally, as he was about
to inform his superiors, a higher posi-

tion of Preview Editor opened, and he
filled the slot. ’ ’

He explains that his major respon- ’

sibility is to preview the new books
that come in. The publications arrive

' in galley form three or four months

before they're published, and are dis-
tributed to the seven editors.

Every Thursday, the seven editors
meet and speak about the books
they've previewed during the past
week. Decisions are made as to
whether each book should be
reviewed, and who will review it.
Watkins smiles when he says that the
meetings are run "democratically,"
and in "open forum style"—almost as
if he's hinting that they're quite the
opposite.

_In addition to ‘scanning about 60
books a week (he only fully reads
approximately two), it is Watkins’
responsibility to match each book to
be reviewed with a critic—a task that
involves knowing each reviewer's
personal ideologies. "You must

uosnvl suqg /ig 3u_1mv.tg' -

And foreign reporting isn't one of
the world's safest occupations.

In Iran, May and his crew were
stoppeda half-dozen times by differ-
ent supporters of the Ayatollah as
they attempted to enter Tehran. "If
you didn't hear them yell to you to
stop, they might shoot you,” he said.
In Zambia, he found himself in the
midst of a gunfire exhange between
poachers and poacher patrols.

He also spent a year on the road as
the Hearst correspondent. '

"For that year, I really didn't live'

anywhere,” May said. "Hardly a week
went by when I wasn't on a plane.”

He called the kind of reporting he
did during this time "parachute jour-
nalism” because he would jump into
the middle of a situation and report
on it. ,

Despite his experiences abroad,
May said he isn't bored with the sev-
eral months he's spent on The Times
city desk, covering everything from
how area ski resorts were handling
the mild winter to the city's, taxi
system.

"Although I'm from here, I've
never seen New York from a re—port-

' er’s vantage point, so it's very inter-

esting for me to get out into the
boroughs that I don't know,” he said.

He doesn't find daily journalism
limiting. -

"It is possible, though difficult, to
write gracefully on a tight deadline,"
he said. "In some ways, it's easier.
When you're writing a seven-or

eight-thousand word magazine piece,‘

you're juggling a great variety of
ideas and incidents and you're work-
ing with developing characters, set-
ting scenes in a way that you don't do
in an 800-word daily news story. .

"The organization’ is more res-
tricted, but that's also a help. You
know when there's less decisions to
make it_' s much faster.

"So there. are restrictions; those,

restrictions can be beneficial and I
think they also present a challenge.
I'm still learning from this."

May said his decision to make a
change in his reporting career is
"somewhat unusual but not unheard
of at The Times." »

"People move around quite a bit at
this paper," he said. "A lot of the edi-

. tors at the magazine had been report-

ers. One editor had been the Moscow
bureau chief."

"I was the youngest editor at the
magazine then. Very often, editing
the ‘magazine is a job people go after
at the end of a long career of
reporting." .

His background is a little more
unusual than most~Times reporters.
Before coming to the magazine in

1981, he was a senior edi-
tor ’ at Geo specializing in foreign
affairs. He also specialized in foreign
affairs at Newsweek, a position he held
before working for the Hearst chain.

May said that because he came into ‘
editing early, he "didn't want to stay _

doing that for the next 20 years or
so."

"I may go back into editing at some
point," he said. "But I think I've
earned my spurs as an editor.”

If The Times has its faults, "it’s still
the best we've got," according to
May. ‘ —

"Most people in most professions
want to work at the best possible
place, where their work can have
impact and where if theydo very
good work, it will gain attention,"
Maysaid. "I think The Times has the

 Pitt Writers’ Conference
Continues Tradition

By JILL SAVITZ

Theyear is 1923. The city is Paris.
Seated at a corner table in a cafe on
the Boulevard Montparnasse are

' Hemingway and Joyce. As they sip

their apertifs, they are discussing
what it's like to be a writer on the Left
Bank in the 1920's‘.

If you missed this scene 50 years
ago, don't despair. Writers and edi-
tors will once again met to discuss
their craft at the University of Pitts-
burgh Seventh Annual Writers’
Conference.

According to Conference Director
and Associate ‘Professor in Pitt's Eng-

lish Department Lee Gutkind, while
4 there are many other writers’ confer-

ences taking place annually, "no one

match the critic's and the author's
sensibilities, and it often gets into the
politics of the situation. Particularly
in non-fiction, if, say, you're dealing
with a book by a conservative, you
don't want to send it out, for
instance, to Kenneth Galbraith, who
happens to be very liberal, because it
looks like a set-up," he says, "He's
obviously not going to like the book.”

No doubt, there are those who see
Watkins’ editorial position with The
Times as one of power and prestige,
but he says that that feeling is limited
to those’ people on the outside. ”It’s a
powerful job in the sense that I look
at the books and decide if they are
going to be reviewed...but it's not
something that you think about.
Outside, yes, people look at it that
way. I was on the west coast doing
research for a book that I'm working
on, and I found that simply by being
from The New York Times, many more
doors were opened for me. However,
that's something that comes with the

For those who want practical

a_dvice'about how to get published '

and paid for what they write, there
will be a "Selling What You Write”
panel. Traditionally, the Conferen-
ce's most popular event, it will fea-
ture Susan Margolis-, Associate
Editor of Playboy, Clifford May, a
former editor of The New York Times
Magazine and currently a cityside edi-
tor for The Times, and Gary Fisketjon,
a Senior Editor at Random House and

I editor at The New York Times Book

Review, who will discuss what it's like
to work for one of the largest- and
most respected daily newspapers in
the world. - ‘

Other events include ”The_ World
of Small Presses," with Jonathan
Brent, former editor of TriQuarterly,
and editor of the fine collection of
fiction, The Best of TriQuarterly; "The
Literary Agent," with John Ware,
former editor for Doubleday 8: Com-
pany before starting his own literary

Editor of Random Review 1982, a collec-
tion of the year's best fiction, poetry,
and essays. The panel will take place
Saturday from 2:00 to 3:20 p.m. in
the Frick Fine Arts Building, where
most of the Conference events will be
held. -

The other panel, "Close-Up: The
New York Times," slated for Sunday
from 11:30 a.m. to 12:50 p.m. in the
Frick Fine Arts Building, will feature
Clifford May and. Mel Watkins, an

agency; and "Book Reviewing," with
Mel Watkins.

A ”Meet the Writers" reception
will take place in the Cloister area of
the Frick Fine Arts Building imme-
diately following Morrison's presen-
tation Saturday evening, and a
"Coffee and Conversation" session
will take place on Sunday morning,
also in Frick F-ine Arts. Refreshments
will be served during both of these
events.

job," he says.

Another condition of working on
The Times is dealing with the paper's
conservative journalistic style. Wat-
kins is quick to point out, however,
that this approach is largely limited to
the daily paper and not the Sunday
magazines. He once interviewed
author James Baldwin, for the daily,
at a time when Baldwin was living in a
house in California that was also
inhabited by black militants. Subse-
quently, the only reason Watkins was
able to find the house was because-it
was surrounded by police cars. ”So I
started my story off on that anecdote,
and it was cut out because I had to
talk about myself. The Times frowns
on that kind of individual first-person
writings," he says, "So, the very fact

that I had to say 'I was looking for an .

apartment in Oakland,’ was looked
upon as a negative aspect."
Recently, Watkins has put himself
in the author's seat, and has been
completing two different writing

projects. The first is a sequence of A

introductions he has written for a
series of novels, by black writers of
the '50s and '60s, being reprinted by
Howard University Press. His second
project is a book on black American
humor, an extended essay on the
changing face of black humor, and
what it signifies in terms of blacks’
attitudes towards their positions in
America. _

Watkins does not see himself at The
New York Times much longer, since the
only position he could advance to
would be management-something
that doesn't interest him. "I'm really
thinking about leaving The Times and
just writing," he says, "I would prefer
doing freelance ‘work, and I have got-
ten over the competitive instinct that
I once had, which was to get to New
York, move up and become big in the
journalistic field.” Then he adds with
a laugh, "I’m getting -to where I'd
rather enjoy myself: I'd just as soon
go to Aruba, find a house on the
beach, play a lot of tennis, write, and
lie around on the-sand." I -

Although the Conference is open

to anyone, it is probably most valua-'-’

ble for students. ”The Conference
had a significant impact on my own
career," said Paul Mathews, a 1977
intern for the Conference, who went
on to attend Radcliffe College's pub-
lishing procedures courseiafter gra-
duating from Pitt. "The Writers’
Conference helped me understand
what I was getting into. Iwent (to the
course) with a better feel for the pub-
lishing industry." .

Former guest Galway Kinnell said
that the Conference gives students ”a
chance to see, face—to-face, poets
whose work they see on the-page,

.and, in an informal atmosphere, get
_ to talk to them."

"I think the Conference has a dou-
ble value," said Larry Lunsford,
Assistant Director of Student Activi-
ties in charge of student media. "One
is that it's a learning experience for
the students who participate, and the
other is that it's good for the sponsors

.//

and. or Pitt to be sponsoring such a - ;

vast program that's becoming nation-
ally renowned." -

The diversity oflthe Conference .

may be a reflection of the diversity of
its sponsors. This year the Office of
Student Activities, the Student Pub-
lications and Media Board, the Pitt

Program Council, the Student‘
Government Board, the College of.

General Studies Student Cabinet, the

‘ Black Action Society, and the Depart-

ment of English are contributing to

"Aspects of Professionalism.” ‘ ‘

The Conference is a unique oppor-

said, but she is always amazed that
even though she encourages her stu-
dents to attend, some don't go. "I
think it's_valuable to see and hear pro-

fessionals in the various fields to get a I

sense of practical detail," she said.

”What I like about it, is that it's a
joint venture between the faculty and
students—something that's done
nowhere else," Gutkind commented.
This year's five student interns
helped solicit funds and plan the con-
ference, under C-utkind' s direction.

Pitt Writing Program Director Ed
Ochester said that the Conference is
”one of the largest collections of wri-
ters we have on campus at any one

time of the year. It gets local people in ~

touch with writers from the outside
world, and it's exciting to hear and
meet the people actually doing the
work." He added that he was pleased
at the number of people who
attended last year—1,000 tickets
were printed and distributed.
Tickets——free to all Pitt students,

faculty and staff,and $5 for- all.

- Susan l\/Iargolis: 

Susan Margolis is a woman. And
she works for Playboy Magazine. But if
you're thinking of a nubile young
thing who earns a living by undress-
ing for millions of men every month,
you're off by a mile. Susan Margolis,
former free-lance writer, teacher,
and author, is Playboy's Associate
Editor. ' .

According to Susan, it's high time
that people realized Playboy isn't just a
skin rag, but a highly-respected mag-
azine which contains the bylines of

"some of the world's best writers.

And, although she finds it somewhat
ironic that she works for a magazine
which many people, especially
women, find pornographic, she
doesn't feel that she's comprising her
position as a feminist to do so.

"Personally, I find Redbook and Cosmo
much more demeaning to women
than Playboy," she says defenisvely, "I
respect the quality of the journalism
in Playboy and the commitment of the
magazine to covering issues is impor-
tant to me.’ ‘ .

"I find it much more stimulating to
write for the unconverted—to write
for people who don't necessarily
agree with me, or to edit article for
those people," she says, pausing to
find the right words, "If I were run-
ning the magazine, there are some
things I would change, and that
would ‘include thegraphics. But I'm
sure, then, that the circulation would
drop. ‘

"I know‘ that some people are
offended‘ by what we do, but I'm not. I
don't have a problem putting ideas
next to sex," she says emphatically.

Although Susan claims to have
more or less fallen into her job at

_ Playboy, she certainly has her work cu

out for her there. ~
"Our main office is in Chicago, so
the office here in New York is really a
bureau and my job is to work with
literary, agents and writers here and

ayoy

Susan Margolis

with publishing houses to find out
what's in the air; to acquire writers
and, sometimes, excerpts of books for
the magazine. I assign articles—so

essentially I have an ear to the side-

walk and try to keep the magazine

alert to trends that start in New

York—intellectual trends, literary
trends...writers who we want to have
working for us_.”

While admitting that most of Play-
boy's articles are assigned, Susan says
that thereise always room for good

writers who want to freelance their

work: "It's funny, because in some
ways, it's a wonderful time to be’a
writer and in some ways, it's a
crummy’ time," she says thought-
fully. "The wonderful thing is that
there are a lot of really good maga-
zines now and they're lookine for
really good writers. They've figured
out that style and substance are

important—it isn't just the subject of
what's in a magazine. And that's
important!

"The negative thing," she adds, "is
that writers who are established have
a much better chance of getting an

article acceptedthan a beginner. To -

be honest, I read every proposal that
comes across my desk, but because
we (Playboy) pay so well, I think we're
more apt to make a commitment to a
writer's whose work we know."

As the associate editor of a maga-
zine like Playboy, Susan is in an envia-
ble position: she has security, she's
well-paid, and she gets the chance to
write herself. But she does miss the
days when she was freelancing and
she wasn't tied to an office job.

”I'd like to think that someday I'll
return to it'(freelancing). I write free-
lance from time to time——I do things
outside, on the other side of the.desk.

Without Pictures

The thing that was exhausting about
freelancing, which isn't exhausting
about what I do now, was the ideas of
’inventing' my job every six weeks or
couple of months——whenever I fin-

ished’ a project. In some ways, those

parts of freelance writing keep you
alive, but when you develop your
skills so that you're awfully good at
telling a story or reporting some-
thing, and then you have to put on a
different hat and go out and knock on
editors’ doors and convince those edi-
tors that you're the person to hire,
well,"she says, "I think those things
can be a strain with free-lance writ-
ing, and I think it's good to take a
break as I did."

"I taught at the university level for
awhile and I taught English, and
there are times when you think to
yourself, 'Oh, God! It's ‘such a_ dream

a to write! If only I could talk ideas!’ "

she says, laughing. .

Along with Clifford May, a cityside
reporter for The New York Times, and
Gary Fisketjon, Senior Editor at Ran-
dom House, ‘Susan will present a
panel at" the Writers’ Conference
entitled "Selling What You Write."
She hopes to discuss and answer
questions about how a writer should
go about freelancing work for publi-
cation, and feels that she has a lot to
say in this area: "If I- could give any
advice to a beginning writer—and by
’beginning,’ I don't mean one who's
just starting‘ to write, but one who's
just starting to market his or her
work—I would say, READ ' ‘THE
MAGAZINE!" she says exasperat-
edly. "Look at the ads, look at the
reviews, look at what else is in that
magazine or "newspaper and figure
out who the audience is and propose
your story that way. You have to be

,alert as to what the market is, so that

when you're proposing something to
an editor, you're aware of what youre
editor's needs are."

Running Through thePublishing Maze

By RAY WUSLICH

_ For most aspiring young writers it
would be enough to make it through
the revolving door of submissions
and rejections and have a piece of

. work published. Through-persistence

and hard work, some will develop a
feel for the game strategy that it
takes to become a successful writer,
but not many writers can find the

' time to really learn the ins and outs of

selling their work—that's why they
turn to agents. For literary agent
John Ware, his pastexperience as a
writer, and as an editor for Double-
day, gives him an edge in this game.

According to Ware, who will be
appearing at the Seventh Annual
Writer's Conference, "I can give a
writer editorial feedback, like, ‘this
point in your third chapter gets away
from the argument too much,’ or
‘your villain is too obvious.’ Agents
who haven't been editors aren't as
able to make these kinds of
suggestions."

But a young writer with visions of
literary greatness may wonder, "Do I
need an agent?" ’ . .

The answer is not completely

dependent on financial considera-
tions, although they may be a part of
it, but, as Ware explains, it depends
on the kind of writing a person does.
Poetry, short-fiction, novels,‘ biogra-
phies, and historical manuscripts will
all appeal to different audiences, and
they all need a different approach
toward publication. While it remains
true that it is possible to submit
unsolicited pieces of short-fiction and
assorted articles to magazines with a
reasonable chance that they will be
published, book—length material is
another matter. .

Books are much tougher to publish
because they involve long—term
returns in terms of royalties, Ware
said, adding that with more than
40,000 books being published every
year, less real editing is being done by
editors. Manuscripts -submitted by
individuals rarely get read, and if they
do it's by a very junior editor.

”I’d say that 90 percent of books
published have been handled byan
agent," Ware notes.

"We screen material andlgive it a
stamp of approval. When we send a

book to an editor he knows» that a —
1 professional has looked at.it._'

 

Iohn Ware

It is the agent's job to try to put
each book in the hands of the pub-
lisher that is best equipped to handle
it. ‘

Having been an editor was an
advantage, Ware says, because it
gives him a feel for what publishers
are looking for. After leaving his edi-
torial position at Doubleday, Ware
says‘ that he ‘spent a year writing and
had several articles published before’
he was offered a position as an agent
for Curtis Brown Associates. He
points out that about a\quarter of his

colleagues have editorial experience,
but that isn't the only important
thing to consider when you're look-
ing for an agent. .

"An agent should have good busi-
ness sense, but there is also the
human factor," he says. "Many of my
clients are people who I_ have never
met except over the phone, and it is
important that a writer have a sense

, oftrust in his agent."

The world of publishing is a maze
of trap doors and pit—falls that may
appear as complex as the web of
plumbing in the basement of Pitt's
Schenley Hall. Just as no one can do
plumbing better than a plumber, "no
one can negotiate a contract with a
publisher better than an agent,"
Ware says. i ’

.W-are isrelatively new in _his busi-

' ness. Most ofthe books he sells are

biographies and he is not yet handling

.any "bigname" authors. Neverthe-

less, there are a few books he is cur-
rently handlingwhich he hopes will
be well received. Among them are The
Definitive Biography of]. Paul Getty, a bio-
graphy of Dwight D. Eisenhower,
and a book about the San Francisco-

based Bechtel ‘Corporation.

The market for new or unknown
writers’ work is not always lucrative,
a fact which causes many large
presses to shy away from publishing
unestablished authors. ‘

Smaller, literary presses also have a
concern about money, but theirs is
not such an urgent one. Books of poe-
try and fiction by unknowns form the
greater part of a small press’ stock.

This year's Seventh Annual Uni-

/)’versity of Pittsburgh Writer's Con-

ference features local small presses
which continue to stay in the black
while offering area residents a var-

iety ofworks and authors from which.

-—/l ‘Young

By TODDVERKEL

Anyone who rises in the publishing

 _. _world as quickly as Gary Fisketjon
 ‘might be labelled an overachiever,

but the 28-year-old senior editor at
Random House Inc. would have you
believe he stumbled upon the busi-
ness, and success, unexpectedly.
The family mink farm held little
appeal for Fisketjon, so he left his
native Oregon for Williams College
in ~'Williamston,. Massachusetts,

- spending his summers in Alaska as a

commercial fisherman, hardly a liter-
ary breeding ground.

After graduating from,Williams in
1976, Fisketjon put off job hunting to
travel around" the country and, when

 his money ran out, he headed back to

Alaska for more fishing.

It wasn't until more than a year and
a half had passed after‘ his graduation
that Fisketjon made his move on the
job market.

As Managing Editor of Random
House's trade paperback, Vintage
Books, and co-editor of the first

i annual Random Review, an anthology of
the 1982's best poetry, fiction and

essays, his moves could be described
as faster and flashier than most.
Fisketjon will join Clifford May,
former editor of Geo and current cit-
yside reporter for The New York Times,
and Susan Margolis, associate editor
of Playboy on the "Selling What You

‘ Write” panel discussion at the Sev-

enth Annual University of Pitts-
burgh Writers"Conference.

Fisketjon hopes to use the discus-
sion to clear up the misconceptions he
feels many people continue to have
about the publishing world and its
participants—writers, editors and
agents.

He got involved in publishing after
completing the now 36-year old Rad-
cliffe Publishing Procedures Course,
an intense six-week overview of all

"phases of the publishing industry.

Graduates of, the course include.Vic-
tor Navatsky, Editor of Nation, and

Publishing occurs on several level-
s,according to Ed Ochester, director
of the Poetry Series at the University
of Pittsburgh Press. '

Major publishing houses, which
handle a large volume of business
(such as Knopf, Random House-and
Simon & Schuster) are trade presses,
which publish both fiction and non-

fiction for general audiences as well ’

as text books for students.

A university press publishes more
poetry and ‘fiction as well as other
works, usually of scholarly interest,
and handles a smaller volume of
business. ,.

Poetry and fiction are primarily
published by a literary smallpress.
The volume, as theltitle indicates, is
usually small, with only one or two
people involved in the press’ opera-

that, ”Fisketjon said. "I didn't know

‘ much about publishingbut, I didn't .

know much about anything else, cer-
tainly not about anything else to do.”

In spite of such modesty, Fisketjon
actually turned down a job offer from

Morrow Publishing because it _,wasn't '

an editing position. Shortly. after
that, they asked Fisketjon back, this
time as an editor. He moved up
quickly, admittedly benefiting from

the misfortune of others when the
two editors he» was working under
both lost their jobs within a couple
months of each other. Finding him-
self with more responsibility than he
ever expected, Fisketjon said that he
"learned quickly.”

He must have also learned his job
well because" Random House was
soon wooing him over to its team of
editors where he moved in the spring
of 1978 at the age of_ 24.

"It causes the obvious problem of
people's saying, 'How can I trust a
person who's so young?/" Fisketjon
said. "Conversely, it's an advantage.
Someone might say, 'This is strange
stuff I've written here, and I don't
‘know if an older editor could really
see the merit of it.’ It cuts both ways."

Fisketjohn's youth certainly hasn't

affected the responsibilities he's been .

given at Random House. He oversees
a "blacklist" of older books, approxi-
mately 800-900 a year, for which he
decides such things as retail prices,
reprinting and rejacketing. He also

tion, but a large number of non-

’ commercial titles emerge from this

type of press.

The title of literary small press
evolved from the generic term, small
press, which can refer to any small
publishing operation regardless‘ of
the material printed. Religious and
political materials are often published
by small presses.

Apart from the financial’ aspects,
trade presses "are less willing to stay
with writers until they find an
audience," Ochester said. "The large

publishers who supported Hemming—

way until he developed a following
aren't there anymore. Alfred’ Knopf
would go for the risk of publishing a
good’ unknown writer."

Often there is a real, book-buying
audience for a ‘writer, but it is too
spread out for the Random Houses
ad_n the Doubledays to reach and still
maintain aquick, and therefore prof-

I .itable,‘turnover. "Even though some

Editor'sRandom Saccess——

acquires, edits, and publishes a"fron—
tlist" (newer books) numbering
between 80 and 90 a year.

In addition to all of that, Fisketjon
and fellow editor Jonathan Galsassi
had to find the time to read more than
600 magazines in order to choose the
10 stories, 15 poems and two essays
to be included-in the Random Review.
Unlike the current Pushcart Prize
anthologies, which recognize only
small press work, or the annual O.
Henry Awards, which is restricted to
stories only, the Random Review
attempted to cover all the major liter-
ary forms. Critics questioned the suc-
cess of that effort,. some calling the

anthology too dispersed, while others —

applauded its sweeping content, but
Fisketjon himself thinks the need for

. something different called for Ran-

dom House's entering the anthology
market. ,

Fisketjon said that both he and
Galassi looked for work that was

' "technically accomplished, and then

some." '
"I think there are writers these
days who get a lot of attention but, I

just find that technically, they are not

any good," Fisketjon said. ”I think
Updike is an example of that. Many
people consider ’him a prose stylist,
but I don't find his prose very
interesting.”

Fisketjon insists that a book's mer-
its still outweigh saleability and that
he takes risks to insure that the dis-
erving books are acquired.

"I never read a book and say, 'This
is really wonderful but I don't think
we can make any money so we won't
do it,"' Fisketjon said‘. "I‘don't. give a
damn how much money I'll lose-I'll
do it. You always hope that quality
will account for something."

He realizes, however, that quality
often goes unnoticed_and that the dis-
appointment of poor-selling. books is
frequently faced by editors and wri-
ters alike. '

"What I tell a friend when their
book doesn't sell very well is that
virtue- is its own reward," Fisketjon
said. ”But that's no fun if you're eat-

ing pork and beans every night."

books are sold, many remain on the
shelf for too long," Ochester said.
Ochester and. his wife, Britt

Horner, started a mail-order retail

distribution. service in 1973 called
Spring Church Books. By distribut-_
ing an annual catalogue, which is
updated once every ~ two months,
Spring Church enables people in all
50 states and even other nations to
order hard-to—get new fiction and
poetry.

Of the small presses represented'at
this year's Writers’ Conference, per-
haps the one which best exemplifies
the spirit of Pittsburgh is the Wolfson
Publishing Company.

Consider Wolfson's latest release,‘

Hail to Pitt. The book is an uplifting
account of the lives and careers of
past and present Pitt athletes which
was edited by sports writer Jim
O'Brien of The Pittsburgh Press, who is a

‘Pitt graduate and former Pitt News

sports editor. .

Marty Wolfson, the owner of
Wolfson Publishing Company, illus-
trated the book and also served as
general coordinator of the project.
Printing of the book was handled by

Pittsburgh's Geyer Printing Com—'
pany, Inc., the vice-presidents of.-
which are _both Pitt Golden Panthers.

Stanley Goldmann, a 1952 graduate,
is a former business manager of the

Pitt News and Bruce McGough is a_

1971 CGS graduate.

The typesetting and even the paper
for the book were supplied by Pitts-
burgh. companies. '

The University of Pittsburgh Press

* also publishes works of high quality.

From 25 to 32 books are published
annually with three-fourths of them
being scholarly works and one-
fourth books of poetry.

The poetry is published through

the Pitt Poetry Series which, accord- ‘

ing to University of Pittsburgh Press

director Fred Hetzel, ”is clearly one of -

the three or four most outstanding
lists of contemporary poetry in the
United States."

The Series is also the controlling
force behind the awarding of the
Drue Heinz Literature Prize for
Short Fiction, now in its third year.
According to Hetzel, "In the 47 year
history of the University of Pitts-
burgh Press, the Drue Heinz Award

and the Pitt Poetry Series are the two .

most valuable and exciting publishing
projects we have ever undertaken."

Funded by the Howard Heinz
Endowment of Pittsburgh, the Drue
Heinz Literature Prize awards a
$5,000 grant to the author of the
chosen manuscript.

Grants, such as the one received ,

from the Howard Heinz Endowment
of Pittsburgh, are crucial to the survi-
val of small presses. A recent grant

from the National Endowment for‘

the Arts has allowed Slow Loris Press
to publish its first piece of fiction, a
novel by writer's conference director,
Lee Gutkind. .
The novel, titled God's Helicopter, has

been in various stages of production .

for the last two years, with the first
copies being made available for the

conference.

"We accepted the novel in 1980 and
it's finally seeing the light of day,
said‘ Patricia Petrosky, who along
with her husband, Tony, run the

_ Slow Loris Press from their home.

”There usually is a two year turnover
between accepting a manuscript and
its release. This is because at a small

Ed McClanahan has come full circle
- with his first novel, The Natural Man.
He wrote the original ”version” of
the story over I 20 years ago for
another writers’ conference. That
short story is now a recently pub-
lished novel, and the 20-year journey
to complete it is the subject of his talk
at this year's Writers’ conference.

The Natural Man is a story about

coming of age in the late 1940's in a
place called Needmore, Kentucky.

' The hero is Harry Eastep, a high
‘ a ‘school senior who finds a mentor in a

new boy in town, Monk McHorning.

"Crude, rude, foul mouthed, he
becomes Harry's mentor, while
Harry for his part sees to it that

Monk receives passing grades. What '

happens and how makes marvelous
reading as Harry and Monk strut
their stuff in Needmore,” according
to one reviewer.

McClanahan said that although the

story line remained unchanged from
the beginning, the form of the story
and its characters did not. - _

”It began as autobiographical
piece," McClanahan said. ”It dawned
on me a couple of yers ago that this

. thing shouldn't be in first person.

Jonathan Brent, former editor of
Tri-Quarterly, works within two

worlds—as a veteran in the world of —

small presses and as a recent adven-

""""t1iré"r into the ‘world of literary

magazines.
Brent will be appearing at Pitt's
Annual Writers’ Conference to intro-

. ' duce the audience to small presses

and their-advantages.

For the unfamiliar, small presses
can be defined as a publishing opera-
tion that only produces about one to
five books a year and publishes only a
‘few thousand copies of each. The
small press is also an important outlet
for poetry and short fiction. Brent
stressed they are not commercial and
only the creative interests of the edi-

_ tor shape the publication's identity.

For years, the majority of large
presses has been concerned solely
with the quest for greater profits
while smaller presses struggled by
with their usual tight budgets and
small, but dedicated staffs. But this
situation is changing, according to
Brent.

”The future of small presses was
never better,” Brent said. ”Small
presses (unlike larger ones) can
afford to take risks; they have low
overhead and they are vital in keep-
ing ideas alive.

"The real advantage to the small
"presses is. that they can take risks and
survive by functioning as they always

4 have,” Brent said.

I There has been a virtual explosion
of small presses working locally and
regionally.

’’Just look at the International
Directory of Literary Magazines and
Small Presses (reference work of
those currently in operation),"
Ochester said. ”It has grown from
three quarters of an inch thick to a
couple of inches.” Commercial pub-
lishers, he added, are too limited by

-. busines and profit concerns so the

and it immediately changed the
whole story. It allowed the book to be
written through imagination.

”The story was no longer about
me. The characters began to live by
themselves. It freed me. It was a liber-
ating thing,” he said.

While McClanahan was a visiting
professor at Stanford during the
early '60s and early '70s, McClanahan
continued working on _the book and
published excerpts from it. ‘During
this time he was also busy writing
short stories and nonfiction pieces
for a variety of magazines, including
Rolling Stone, Playboy, Place, and The Free
You. ‘

He finished his nine-year stay at
Stanford and went on to Lecture-
ships at the University of Kentucky,
the University of Montana, and
Northern Kentucky University.

He started a final draft three years
ago after the publishing company of
Farrar, Straus, and Giroux bought
the company that held the rights to
his book. They told him he had one
year to finish it.

McClanahan, who had just com-
pleted a one-year visiting lectureship
at Northern Kentucky University,
didn't have another job to go to and
had just built a new room where he
could write on his farm in Port Royal

Kentucky.

He worked full-time on the novel,
making ' the major point of view
change and tinkering with characters
a little before completing it.

McClanahan doesn't regret the
time it took for him to write the book.-

”If I wouldhave finished it sooner

presses.
”Freedom of the press belongs to
those who own a press,” Ochester

added. ”That's the reason for the"

explosion.” I .
Marketing and promotional con-
cerns pose a formidable problem to an
otherwise brigh't future for small
presses. For this reason, Brent
termed the situation in the world of
small presses today ”paradoxical.”

"The future

small presses was
never better...”

Godine Press, for example, was a
small press run by _ David Codine
which recently sold out to a larger
press. Godine used to promote his
books on his own time by personally
‘contacting distibutors.

"This costs a lot of time and
money," Brent explained’. ”A small
press is really run on the energies of
its small staff and has a small distri-
bution network."

Brent's collection of fiction from
Tri-Quaterly, entitled The Best of Tri-
Quarterly, met with considerable suc-
cess. It was unique in that it
presented works written in the mod-
ernist tradition; and fictionjlgood fic-
tion, Brent said, stands on its own.

”I published the collection to show
that fiction hasn't stagnated,” he
explained, ”and I felt this collection
would help in doing away with any
presumptions that fiction is dead.”

Brent eventually left Tri-Quarterly
in the .spring of 1982. to develop For-

of»

mations, his new literary magazine
which will be published by the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin Press.

Beginning a new magazine takes
new ideasbefore money and promo-
tional attempts. And new ideas ar_e
what Brent says characterize Forma-
tions. His ideaslrepresent a departure
form the typical journal which con-
centrates on literary criticism of
years gone by and ignore current
happenings. ‘

”People who write know little
about what is happening in the other
arts,” Brent explained. ”Writers are
mostly at universities and writing to
get tenure as a requirement of their

position. This isolationism is one of .

the defining qualities of the literary
situation and noticing this is one of

the reasons I wanted to start this I

magazine.” .
To assist him in this endeavor,

. Brent will be drawing from the tal-

ents of an editorial board who will
help maintain the magazine's broad
interests.

Contributing editors include Car-
los Fuentes from Mexico, whose col-
lection of short stories was published
in 1980 and whose novels include
Terra Nostra; Julian Rios, who lives in
Spain where he edits two literary ser-
ies;pArnosat Lustig, a- Czechoslava—
kian immigrant to the United States
whose ficiton has appeared in The Best
of Tri-Quarterly; Phillipe Sollers, a

tor of Swallow Press; William Gass,
american literary critic and novelist;
Robert Creeley, poet, critic, and
novelist whose numerous volumes of

beenso happy with it,” he said.

Finishing the novel made McClan-
ahan ”feel lonely. I pined a little."

”Every night for 20 years I fell
asleep thinking about the next line in
the novel," he said. ”Now there is
nothing to_put me to sleep.”

verse include A Form of Women; Marjo-

rie Perloff, a Viennese whose‘ critical
works included The Poetics of Indetermi-
nancy: .
professor of the Northwestern Uni-
versity School of Music; Lucy Lip-
pard, art critic for The Village Voice;
German—born Karsten Harries,
former chairperson of philosophy at
Yale University; and Guy Davenport,
a poet, painter, critic, short story wri-
ter, and classical scholar.

Because Brent wants Formations to
reach a larger audience than that
inside the university, he is faced by
some difficult problerns—problems
that face every literary magazine the
same asthey do small presses.

One problem is coming up with the
funds to pay the high honorariums
which good fiction demands. Pay-
ments range between $500 to $1000.
The greater problem, "however,
according to Brent, is promotion.

”First,” Brent explained, ”you have
to start with the realization that
nobody needs you, nobody wants
you, and nobody really cares.” To get
established, therefore, you have to

and do direct mailings.
”I regard this promotion as the
most painful of all expenditures

because it is so totally unproductive,’ ’ V

he said. ”You pay a fortune for it all—
and for what!"

Despite the odds stacked against
any new literary_magazine claiming a
significant portion of the market,
Brent persists in pursuing this pro-
ject ot its completion. He says he has a

lot of faith in Formations.

“The magazine will be a succes if it
succeeds in being a catalyist to
discussion—to scrutinizing the assump-
tions surrounding the-arts today,” Brent
said. ' ' _

He said he has no intention to deal
exclusively with literary subjects.

“The literary avant-garde didn't exist
in total isolation,” Brent said. “And
Formations won't work in a vacuum.’

On March 19, at the Saturday
night reading at Carnegie Lecture
‘Hall, The Leo Koeberlein Award of
/jicellence, named after the 1937-38
Pitt News editor and recently retired
Executive Editor of The Pittsburgh Press,
will be presented to two current Pitt
News staff member who have shown
the drive and talent required for
superior achievement in journalism.
The students will receive a $500 each
scholarship donated by Typecraft
Press Incorporated and $150 in books
from B. Dalton Booksellers. The
award will be presented by Leo Koe-

yw" rlein, who will also receive an

honorary award. ~

When first approached by Lee Gut-
kind, coordinator of the journalism
program at Pitt, about having the
award given in his name, Koeberlein
was surprised. "It was an unexpected
honor,” he said, ”I'm happiest because
it honors The Pitt News as much as it
does me. I thought so many people
might deserve it more than I did."

Gutkind, however, didn't agree. A
few years ago, he approached Koe-
berlein about allowing senior jour-
nalism students to intern at The Press

_ ‘ tiring the regular school term. Koe-

berlein agreed to give it a try and
found that the students could be
accomodated.

According to Gutkind, Koeberlein
took a risk. in accepting his students.
"It was a real chance for him to take
because Pitt no longer had a journal-
ism department," he said, "We were
just beginning our journalism pro-
gram again when he agreed to
cooperate.”

From The PittNews  

To The Press

By DINA LARDAS
* students have interned at The Press,

including UPI Beirut corespondent
Scott McCloud and AP Washington
correspondent Gene Grabowksi. '
Matt Kennedy, a reporter for The
Press, was also one of the interns, and
he found the experience invaluable.
"The academic internship, like my
work at The Pitt News," he said, "pro-
vided me with a chance to apply class-
room theory to real field situations.”
As for Koeberlein, Kennedysaid,
”To a reporter, he was a demanding
newspaper manager who wanted the
best, the soonest, with all of it abso-
lutely accurate. He set the kind of
standards that force a reporter to

push himself to the maximum, and

the biggest beneficiaries were the
readers of The Pittsburgh Press and the
residents of this town.”

Like the interns, Leo Koeberlein’s
career had its roots at Pitt. Colleague
Ralph Brem, Managing Editor of The
Press, describes Leo as ”a tremendous
professional, who can also be very
stubborn when his mind is made up
on something.” Pitt faculty members
could have made that same comment

Brand new offices and thousands
of dollars worth ofnew equipment
have helped promote an air of profes-

student media at Pitt.

furniture, _along with some of the

latest equipment in journalism.

”We’ve got some of the best facili-
ties in the United States right now,"
said Larry Lunsford, Assistant Direc-
tor of Student Activities and advisor
for the media.

The Pitt News recently received
five Visual Display Terminals
(VDTs); from the renovating fund of
the Student Union building. The

The Pitt student media has come a
long way in a short period of time.
Lunsford said that when he came to
Pitt six years ago, all the media were
in debt.
”We just had to worry about stay-
ing alive," he said. V
The first task was to clear the debts
and learn to manage budgeted money
better. The Publications and Media

 oard, which oversees all media

 activities, was created two years ago.

The media has also been getting
gmore input from the Pitt faculty—the
English. Department now has eight

eral of the "professors have become .

more involved with the newspaper,
according to Lunsford. -

A class has been created exclusively
for writers of The Pitt News, and gives
credit to newspaper staffers.

The purpose of this class is ”to
strengthen theindividual skills of the
students who are enrolled, thereby
improving the paper in general,”

instructor this semester.

thisenthusiasm has carried over.”
Lunsford said that the radio

employees ran into quite a few diffi-

culties during their stay in the base-

_ ment, including extreme heat, which

not only ruined some equipment, but
made everyone irritable. ,
"If_ they hadn't. been dedicated
staffers, they would have had trouble
surviving,” Lunsford said.

faculty and the staff's new, more ded-
icated attitude have been reasons for
The Pitt News’ improvement in both
the editorial and business depart-
ments over the years.

Another newly-equipped student
media is WPGH radio, the campus
AM radio station. It received four
new turn—tables, a new control board
for the production studio, a new tape
deck, a new cartridge machine, a cou-
ple microfilms and other miscellane-
ous items at a cost of $21,000.

Mike Freshwater, General Man-
ager of WPGI-I, said that the equip-
ment (and the new location, on the
fourth floor of the Student Union
Building, rather than the hot‘base-
ment where it was previously
located) has inspired a change in the
quality of the workers and the sound.

"People ‘have seen that the studios
are new and the equipment is new
and they're taking on a new attitude,"
Freshwater said. "When we first got
on the air from the new studio in

October, everyone was up\ for it and

  

sound is much clearer and more
adjusted for going into the dormito-
ries and cafeteria. .

WPGH, which ran 24 hours last
year, now runs from 6 a.m. to 9‘p.m.

One of its biggest plans for the
future is a spring hearing with the
Federal Communications Commis-
sion. WPGH is applying for an FM
license so it can be carried all over the
city rather than on just the college
campus.

It is also planning to pick up the
RKO radio network, which, from
midnight to 6 a.m., runs a show called
”Midnight America.” This program
airs across the country via satellite
from New York, and includes both
music and talk-show format.

A journalism laboratory class has
been approved for the fall semester;
students involved in the media will do
assignments during the class period.

With their brand new equipment
and a more positive overall attitude to
go along with it, the future looks

first to him. Chancellor Bowman
allowed the professor to take on the
job, but later issued a statement say-
ing teachers at Pitt were not permit-
ted to hold off-campus jobs. The Pitt
News then printed a list of faculty
members who were employed out-
side the University. Chancellor Bow-
man's name was at the top of the list.

After that, Bowman insisted that
the faculty advisor to the paper
review all editorial matter. When the
Board of Publications approved Bow-
man's decision, Koeberlein resigned
as editor.

”Whatever the differences,” said
Koeberlein, ”Dr. Clifford Carlson-
he was Pitt's basketball coach and
head of Student Health Service-
helped to mend the bridge between
the students and the Chancellor. He
convinced Chancellor Bowman that
his was the wrong way to go. He
(Bowman) then withdrew_ his insist-
ence that the faculty advisor read edi-
torials.” Koeberlein resumed his
position as editor.

Perhaps Koeberlein recalled the
difficulties he had getting into the
business when he decided to take on
the Pitt students.

When Koeberlein graduated in I
1938 at the tail end of the depression,-

newspapers weren't hiring; but he
filled out a detailed application form
from The Press, listing "model airplane
building" as a hobby. Almost a year
later, he received an interview with

.William‘ Forester, then Managing

Editor of The Press.

"I thought, ’finally, he's recognized
my journalistic talents!’ " recalled
Koeberlein, ”But when I got there, he
sat me down and said ‘tell me about
your‘ airplanes.”

The Press, at the time, sponsored

The Junior Aviators—an in-paper_

promotion club for young people
interested in model airplanes. It was
Koeberlein’s knowledge in that field
that gave him the edge he needed to
land a job at The Press. ‘

After working at the copy desk and
as Assistant News Editor, Koeberlein
became Assistant City Editor, work-
ing under Larry Pagan, who came
from the "old school" of journalism,
which meant instilling fear into his
reporters. At the time, The Press was
in competition with another after-
noon daily, The Sun-Telegraph, and was
putting out five editions a day. Koe-
berlein remembers the number of
times that, leaning over his typewri-
ter for a moment or two to collect his
thoughts, he could hear Fagan's voice
booming, "Leo, stop thinking and-
start writing!"

As Executive Editor, Leo Koeber-
lein played a major role in starting the
zone adclitions—Pittsburgh Press sup-
plements to the surrounding areas. A
strong believer in covering all local
news as thoroughly as possible, he
felt that a weekly addition to specific
neighborhoods in the Pittsburgh
area, as opposed to constant coverage
of regional news, would be the best
way to handle the paper's growth in
circulation.

Leo Koeberlein retired from The
Pittsburgh Press in the fall of 1981, but
the changes he incorporated are still
there—the zone additions from Press
readers and the internship for young
writers. Koeberlein gives much credit
to colleges for helping journalists get
started today.

"Universities see more, (they see)
the need to produce communicators,"
he said. ”Each successive class that
comes out now to join the ranks is

really better prepared—not only with .

skills,“ but with knowledge."

 The Nation’sOldest  

  Writing Program

By MARK A. SINDLER

Although venerability does not
necessarily guarantee credentials,
the Pitt undergraduate writing pro-
gram does carry with it the distinc-
tion of being the oldest in the nation.
There is another and more important
distinction, ‘however, that writing

’ director Edwin Ochester quickly

makes evident: special attention to
the student is readily stressed no
matter what writing tract is
encountered. '

”I would have to say that programs
found at Iowa's workshop, the pro-
gram at Stanford, and the Columbia
graduate program are more presti-
gious,” Ochester said. ”However, I
can't think of any other program that
gives as much attention to the stu-
dent as the one at Pitt. That is not to
say that each class is an experience in
itself, but there is a great willingness
on the part of the faculty to hang
around, to have longer office hours,
gab on, and just make themselves
more available.

Presently, there are about 250 Pitt
undergraduate writing majors that
comprise the field; Arizona comes
next with approximately 190 writing
majors. In’ addition to those enrolled
in collective courses, there are Eng-

" lish Writing Majors in the College of

Arts and Sciences and College of
General Studies. Both schools also
offer a Small Certificate in Writing

Program. —
Included in the undergraduate field ~

is the fastly-emerging journalism
program, which was resurrected in
1970 after the journalism depart-
ment was disbanded around 1960.
1970 was also the year Associate Eng-
lish Professor Lee Gutkind arrived at
Pitt. There was only one journalism
course then, but students wanted
more. ~
”I taught most of the courses back
then," Gutkind reminisced, ”and they
were well-enrolled. Students wanted
a journalism program and, as we
added more courses and part-time
faculty, enrollment always justified
adding additional courses.”

But it was Ochester, Gutkind
stressed, who was most influential in
the rebuilding process and who

A ”linked us all together.”
‘ A ”I’ll take some credit for the pro-

gram,” Ochester continued, ”but Lee
has really been the person to develop
the non-fiction tract, or ‘journalism’
as it's starting to be called. He, so far
as I can recollect, was first to be
teaching journalism-type courses, as
opposed to the essay-type.

In stark contrast to the relatively
ancient undergraduate program is
the graduate Master of Fine ‘Arts
offering, which is only in its third
year.-_. The MFA, as it's popularly
referred to, is constructed on three
tracts: non-fiction, poetry, and fic-
tion.’_' Ochester acknowledges the lat-
ter category as most popular, but
adds}. that the graduate offerings
overall are quickly gaining
acceptance.

In anticipation, though, Ochester

A is not looking for a crowd: ”Althou-gh.

we would like to see our students
become popular, we can't let it grow
willy—nilly," he said. _

Citing both as typical people who

“have visited the department from

outside Western Pennsylvania,
Ochester included Jean Laskus (a
freelancer for a Philadelphia maga-
zine) and John Porter, who works out
of North Carolina where he free-
lances for newspapers and
magazines.

Laskus and Porter are similar of
others in the non-fiction tract in that
they are part of a majority who leave
their writing field to upgrade their
skills. The non-fiction tract special-
izes in feature articles for magazine
freelancing.

According to Ochester, the writing
opportunities do not abound to an
unlimited degree; people don't usu-
ally support themselves with just
writing, ”but would be dishwashers,

doctors, or teachers.” _

He continued, ”Teaching permits
writers to be in constant Contact with
people, and the fact that one is work-
ing with his/her specialized craft is a
good idea. This is especially true of
the non—fiction"faculty members who
come back to get away and talk to the
students.”

Currently, this non-fiction tract
employs six full-time faculty with the
addition of a full-time magazine
member in the very near future. It is
through these people that the Pitt
non-fiction section has developed
into a class of its own, Gutkind»

emphasized. There is none other like _

it in the nation.

"There is nothing like it, really, in
the country,” he said. ”Other schools
have separate journalism schools,
whereas others might have just writ-
ing programs. q

’’We have as many journalism
courses as other journalism schools,
but in those there's too much empha-

sis on journalistic technique and so

forth as far as the departments are

' concerned,” Gutkind concluded.

Her does not want the journalism

program established here to move
toward the department concept of
yesteryear. Citing the age of speciali-
zation as ”bygone," Gutkind said edi-
tors are now looking for writers who
are not constrained by journalistic
conformity.

The undergraduate writing
majors, Gutkind said, are taught by
people who are interested in produc-
ing well-rounded students ready to
encounter any writer-related subject
once out of school, not just strict
journalism.

”Editors don't want people in a nar-
row journalism spot now," Gutkind
maintained. ”They want people who
can move from subject to subject and

style to style. We're getting much_

stronger now and will, in fact, have a
fulltime. magazine person soon.”
The most recent fulltime addition
to the non-fiction tract is Jim Ross—
former_reporter and bureau chief of

the Hartford Cburant. Ross also believes ‘

journalism schools are turning out
students who will only have access to
a very narrow field of jobs.

”The program here," Ross con-
tinued, ”prepares one for any profes-
sional endeavor, I would hope-—not
just poets or novelists. Most univer-
sities have schools of communication
and probably offer a wider variety of
journalism courses than Pitt.

In contrast, students in the jour-
nalism tract will be exposed to tradi-
tions in literature, fiction, and poetry.
Journalism will be exposed as a craft,
Ross added, and not as a trade as one
would earn a union card for to make
the Associated Press scale. Ross is not
aiming to hinder people trying to gain
newspaper positions, but would like

them to graduate with an all around.

For this to happen, the non-fiction .
department is in the process of. " V
‘ revamping its status.'The basic intro-~ V 

ductory course, Writing 55, has been
taught with the ”inverted pyramid”
in mind. The course has also been
taught based on widely ranging des-
criptions, thus making it difficult for

professors—teaching upper‘-leve1KW..

courses—to know how much or what ’

the student has learned. .

Starting this fall, Writing 55 will be
broken down into a lecture and lab
course. Ross said that the offering
will reveal the basic topics of journal-
ism, including interviewing tech-
nique, the First Amendment as its
implications, the inverted pyramid,
and the "basic nuts and bolts of

J journalism.”

Said Ross, f’We’ll then have unifor-
mity so that when a student leaves

55, he or she will have a certain body
of knowledge. For courses such as
Newspaper I, there will be committee
meetings and -we will talk to the peo-

I ple teaching the courses so that we

can avoid problems the student may
be having now."

Ross believes that with the addi-
tion of the forthcoming magazine
instructor, there will come a coordin-
ated writing sequence. aided by ”the _

people we have_now." Accordingly»;s(-_'.

the program will attract ”good stu-
dents, graduate good writers, and
skilled reporters. 4

”We’ll be doing a more effective
job,” Ross envisioned.

Enroute to completeing that
market-satisfying job, Ross hopes to
turn yet another corner, making part
of the ancient undergraduate pro-
gram even more unique.

”Someday I would like to see
courses in journalism taught from

the literature standpoint with refer~{€f._‘~

ences to Hemingway, Dickens,

.' ism,” Ross said, ”because good writ-
ing is good writing.” ’ ‘

gather material for hislbooks, but

God's Helicopter is a different venture.

altogether. Instead of going around
the country on a motorcycle for Bike
.1-"ever, or with a crew of umpires for
The Best Seat In Baseball But You Have To
Stand!, Gutkind spent 15 years revisit-
ing his childhood in Pittsburgh to
write the book. "It's the story of my
‘ jfe," he said, ”about a boy I knew who

’ died where I grew up, and how it

affected me.”

p God's Helicopter may be about Gut-
kind's childhood but the issues it
deals with are confronted by all of us.
Besides being about a boy who dies,
it's about how three young men who
are scorned by their peers band
together and learn about friendship,
sex, and growing up.

Although the book is fiction, it is
based on truth. "I have no idea where
the truth leaves off and fantasy beg-
ins. It's very difficult for me to tell the

:2rlifference," said Gutkind.

The characters in God's Helicopters
stem from Gutkind’s childhood, but it
.wasn't until he enrolled in night
school at Pitt in 1964 that he started
writing about the main character,
Ronald Middlebaum. Middlebaum
was featured in two short stories that
were the seeds of God's Helicopter. Gut-

  And Growing Up

kind considers the book his most
important project because ”Ronald
Middlebaum is the first character I
wrote about from my own personal
experience, with "passion and
sincerity.” I

According to Gutkind; there were
many times over the years when he
wanted to abandon work on the
novel. "Every time I decided I would
give up and throw it away, something
revived me," he said.‘ He kept show-
ing it to agents and publishers but
they kept saying it wasn’ ready yet.
So, he would put it aside for awhile,
only to work on it later.

A National Endowment of the Arts
Creative Writing Fellowship finally
allowed Gutkind to devote more time
and energy to God's Helicopter in 1-97 8.

Lee Gutkind: Bikes,Baseball

But the final draft wasn't "completed.

in Pittsburgh where the rest of the
book was written and where all the
action takes place; ‘it was written in
1979 at the Virginia Center for the
Creative Arts, an artists’ colony near
the Shenandoah Mountains.
Gutkind compared writing from
personal (and sometimes painful)

p'ast experience to the task of

researching and interviewing to
gather information for non-fiction
books.

"It’s fun to write about baseball and
about people you like, but it's a differ-
ent story entirely when the things
you're writing about aren't necessar-
ily much fun and aren't necessarily
good memories. It's more‘ of a
squeeze to write about things that
mean so much to you,” he said.

Publishing fiction is new to.Gut-
kind, but publishing non-fiction is
not. For Bike Fever, his first book, Gut-

uoslwg paxj /ig Sugmvxg

kind immersed himself in the motor-
cycle subculture of the '60s by riding
around the country on his bike on and
off for four years. For The Best Seat In
Baseball But You Have To Stand!, Gutkind
observed the world of -”balls, bats,
tobacco juice and sun-baked dust"
while he travelled with a crew of
National League baseball umpires.

He has also made a documentary
film, A Place\]ust Right, about the back-
woods people of western Pennsylva-
nia, which -was recently awarded a
Golden Eagle by CINE, the Council
on International Nontheatrical
Events, and was also selected by
CINE to represent the United States
in a number of international motion
picture events. Penn's Woods West Revis-
ited, a series of profiles on the moun-
tain people he met making the film,
will be published by the University of
Pittsburgh Press next year.

But God's Helicopter is different than
Gutkind’s other works, besides the
fact that it's fiction. While Bike Fever
and The Best Seat In Baseball But You Have
To Stand! were published by commer-
cial publishers in New York, God's

-Helicopter will be published in the city

where it takes place: Pittsburgh. It is

fitting that a book which is so close to
Gutkind's heart is being published so
close to his home by Slow Loris Press,
a small but national, nonprofit ‘pub-
lishing company that received a
National Endowment of the Arts
grant to publish the work.

The book is also different from his
other works in that it's illustrated.

Slow Loris suggested that Fred Carl-

son, who teaches illustration at
Carnegie—Mellon ‘University, would
be a good person for the job.

"It was fascinating for me to see
how he saw things,” said Gutkind of
the 12 illustrations and cover for the

‘book.

With two non-fiction books, an
award-winning film, articles for Sports
Illustrated, The New York Times, and Dis:
covery-under his belt, what's next for
Lee Gutkind? "Maybe something
ne‘w—possibly a play," he said. He
feels that he's able to expand in so
many directions because he tries not
to limit himself to any one form of
writing: ”Some people like tocall
themselves novelists. Other people
like to call themselves poets. I've
always beena writer—I want to con-
tinue to feel free to move in any crea-

' tive direction."
