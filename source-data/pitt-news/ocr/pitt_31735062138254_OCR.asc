THE ALUMNI _ BUll..D§lING

It is ,,well known that in modern
colleges 6. the tuition paid by the stu-
dent. does not cover more than one-
third-the cost of his education, the
deﬁciency, being -made up from in-
come of the end=o‘wme’nt _ fund, ,gifts
from interestedlfriendis andaid from
the ‘city and s.tate_‘. The endowment
was provided in years past by liberal
persons who had the interests of
our co~mmunity at heart and A were
sufficiently foresighted to realize

well be a power {or good through
future generations. ‘The Endowment
of the University is ‘ridiLculou_sly
small -for__.its,ne.eds, but it will grow
as the num-her of alumni increase
and"reach the prosperity of ‘middle
life. 7 y .
