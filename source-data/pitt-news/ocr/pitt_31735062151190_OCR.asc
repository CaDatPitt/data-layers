This committee recommended that
the band be continued as a student
organization, conducted and cgn-
trolled according :9 its own~cohstitu-
tion, with the exception that it be sub-
jected tolthe rules and regulations of
the Milita-ry Committee tonthe extent
of the same amount of time and ‘serv-
ice, -as is required of the -students tak-
ing the regular drill. At other times
the -band .will be subject to the call

tee, consisting of Messrs. A. J. Kelly,
Jr, and A. R. Hamilton, Director C.
s. Miller and Prof. F. J. Holder. This
is the committee that served in a sim-
ilar capacity last year. This recom-
mendation will be presented to the

 mark those of us left "behind persist in the care free_habits

,, attitude of the students is of no more sober a character than‘
3 before, and, all told there seems tobe 1187 real conception of the
' horrible ordeal that faces us. _ Theload that has been put down
by’ ,Russia' while traversing» the labrynthian processes of her own
“poﬁtical destiny must be assumed by «Aineriqa if this’ clash of

. ‘ . BASKETBALL ~ . _' .
Now that the 1917 football season is "history, the attention
 of the students turns to basketball. No better selection could
ﬁhave been made by the members of last year’s team, than the
 ‘election, of Easterday to captaincy. We were all extremely sorry
 when we’ learned thathit would be impossible for McNu1ty to
‘ ~'1ea_d the team this year. McNulty was one of tl1e best guards
‘ that ever represented the Gold and Blue. However, in “Katy”
7-Easterday the team will have a leader that will measure up to
;”_'.the high standard set by our athletic teams in years gone by.
 _  We ‘regret the loss of such stars Q “Andy” Hastings,
'~ “Jimmie” DeHart, “Ben” Lubic,’Frank McNulty and “Tack”
 Hammer from our last year's team, but we believe that their
.:_p1aces will be well taken care of by candidates who have already
‘tu-ri1ed_ out for positions on the team. We still have McLa1-en,
,-Carlson, Easterday, McCullough, and we are looking to Mc-
Carter, Nicalos, Penman and others to take. the places left
"vacanttby enlistments and graduation. - _ ‘

The point raised by‘ one of the

a letter sent out by Chairman T. H.

to‘ the University as a VS/ar Need
and will bear repetition. .Here it is:

The Great War is a war, of

“ANDY” HASNT P
' LOST GRID FEVER

"Andy” Hastings has written a let-
ter to the Alumni Secretary from
France. which we are sure ‘will be
persucd with pleasure by all Pittites.
"Andy" is with the Uni_versity,Base

ter is dated November 10:

I_ have‘a few minutes time now and
will drop you a few lines. This is the
day of the W. & J. game and I do not
have any fear for the rest of the season.
We got the Syracuse score this morn-
ing but so far we do not have any word

of the Penn game. From the way the
papers talked I think we must have

won from Penn, but wheJi I come to
think of it I believe we meet Penn
after we play Syracuse this'year.
Please give Coach W'arner and “Red"
Carlson my congratulations. George
.\IcI.a'ren must be going some. To my

mind he is the best football player I
have ever lznown.

Kelley got the measles and nine of
us were detained in England for about
three weeks and a half. We are all here
now. We have a beautiful place here
with pretty grounds around it. We are
south of Paris and where they have a
mild winter. We have aglot of hard
work but I guess we can stand up under
it. I am mighty glad that I am here
but am afraid the Russian situation is
going to prolong) the war. I want this
war to be over efore I get so old that
I can play my last year of football.
Want another crack at it. This is
about the only branch of the service
that I would, get time’ to keep myself
in shape.

I wasn't afraid of the team this year
so far as material was concerned for
I think we had a second team that was
made up of champions. too. I was a
little afraid w might get smeared be-
fore Warner got the machine working,
He surely is the best in the land and
when he was secured a great thing was
done for Pitt football. 1 hope he stays
with us until he retires.

The whole Unit is with the team and
_ We all
yell to beat the dlckens when we get
a. new score. We have a. football with

us and “Jim" Morrow and 1 have been
booting it around. Makes you wish you
were in the mic again.

VVEERLILS this morning and-I had to
take time out to re d them. I hope the

must .be kept up and the main-
tenance of the University is all
important. The alumni are re-
sponding nobly to the call of the
Red Cross and kindred organiza-
tions. The call of the University
must- not be overlooked and
should be of peculiar interest to
the graduates, who owe a debt to
her that they can never fully re-
pay. '
So.-re Indirect Beneﬁts 9;
The campaign is sure to have many
indirect beneﬁts to the University
which will make themselves apparent
as the years go by. It is hoped that
all senior classes, as they leave the
halls of the University, will make
similar contributions to Alma Mater,
so that eventually Old Pitt will have
a small army of workers back of her,
sharing their successes with her. The
future of the University will then
be assured. \Vealthy citiz_ens of Pitts-
burgh, many of whom have yet to
show their appreciation of the Uni-
versity, are sure to be attracted by
the spirit of giving exhibited by the
alumni, and will lend their aid. It
should be only a matter of a few
years before Pittsburgh's money will
be poured into the University's cof-
fers. Then. and only then, can the
ambitious prograni outlined by the
University's authorities for the up-
building of the institution be carried
out.

Several of the Pittsburgh papers
have recently printed letters from Pitt
alumni who are in the University Base

We believe they are worth reproduc-

to be especially interes«t1'ng to the stu-

The Pittsburgh “Dispatch" printed
a letter from W’, Dgn Hise, Ex. '15,
who is with the Unit. Hise is from
Salem, O., and was in the School of
liconomics. Before entering the ser-
vice ‘he was a Pittsburgh newspaper

graduates of his day as a letter man
on the varsity track team and man-

TWO _FIVES ARE
  PRACTICING

 

The two basketball teams are now
practicing regularly at the gym—the
Varsity on Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays "under Coach Dr. Flint
and‘ the Freshmen on Tuesdays and
Thursdays under Coach Oschenhirt.
The outlook is not.so bad,.in spite
of the fact that many of last year’s-.
team have been lost. The-it loss will
be greatly felt, but it will in a meas-
ure be made up by the men from last
year's Freshmen squad. Lubic and
Hammer graduated last spring and
both are now in the service, as are
Hastings and._DeHart, who still had
another year at Pitt. Captain-elect’
McNulty has been dropped from the
Pitt athletic list because he played
professional football this year.

._pro.ceeds, inevitable as these are. Immediately on putting the many policies
inforce, Pitt ‘has a new, strong credit backing and 3 cash sinking fund that
keeps steadily, compounding up to the total amount insured. From the start
this gives a sound basis for financing present needs. _ i
