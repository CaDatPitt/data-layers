Wednesday, in a lpleaiorl student con-
tributions to the Jewish PPWar Relief
Campaign. In his -capacity as agent

Major, Rather“. had an, excellent oppor-'
tunity to observe conditions %in prac-
tically every country in Europe, and
his portrayal of the present situation
in Eastern , Europe was decidedly
gloomyzé Nevertheless, ‘he asserted, no.
living man possessed the -skill to
adequately depict the full‘ V‘ horror of
conditions- He further related how,
through imeagernessof funds it was
found_neTcessary to let the older men
and women starve, since there were
barely suﬂicient eatables to keep the
young generation alive. .His appeal
met with a. generous response, $200
being raised in answer- to his plea.

‘exceedingly fortunate in having back

;_1a"ced Pitt in former -battles. Syra-

jzhrongh the season without being

 er, when~Geneva scored two points on

V_-3;;-;sahfety,,' fwhen the morning papers
appeared in the city they showed a

piilpcked it, the ball rolling over.the
,t-‘Pitt goaliline. In the scramble a Pitt
 fell on it for a safety, thus‘ giv-
 Geneva her sole score. The dif-
"rence between the safety and the

tauchback is the cause of many a mis-
fptlderstanding between teams, and
everyone,‘ the officials in particular,

should endeavor to familiarize them-

Robertson at center'~has been show-.
ingﬂa lot .of class lately. ‘He is a
husky‘ lad, steadies~.h»is team in the
attackiand has proved..to be a great
defensive player. At_. left guard Capt.
Alexander is a good-defensive player
and his speed enables him to get into
every play. Thompson looks like the
man ilor the other guard,-sbut he is
being closely pushed.;for,the job by
Perrin. Segal is‘ a strong tackle,
good on offense and defense and he
has an excellent running .mate_ in
Hoople who started against-the Army
last -Saturday and made. a good show-
ing. Ed<lie_Brown and Schwarzer seem
to be the best of a wealth of end ma-
terial and are said to be adept at
both receiving and breaking up the
forward pass. ‘ ' I

As yet O’Neill- seems unable to
pick the best out of a large and classy
bunch of backﬁeld men. He has men
of such high caliber as Hiatt, Keenan’,
Sawyer, Basba, -Steele, Dunn, Ackley
and‘ Swing.

Well Balanced Team.

All in all, the Panthers will be up
-against a heavy, well balanced team
when they travel to the home of the
Orange and Black" next ‘Saturday.
O’Neill’s men will present a power-
ful;, coherent’, versatile attack _ and
they are prepared to ﬁght to the last
ditch. They are hard tacklers, follow
the ball closely, and it is expected
that Warner’s men will be called upon
to exert themselves to the ‘utmost to
penetrate their stonewall defense.

So far this season Syracuse .has
played two games, the last being an
especially good -game in which a ﬁne
showing was made in defeating the
Army. The work of the backﬁeld
composed of Askley, Fallon, Abbott
and Ewing earninggreat praise. The
line also made quite an impression on
the critics- _ _

Another Re-al Test.

According to dope this game will-be
another real test for _“Pop" Warner’s
team and is awaited with enthusiasm
byfootball fans all over the country.

However, the Pitt rooters are chock
full of conﬁdence since the victory of
their favo 'tes last Saturday over the
far-famed ‘ est. Virginia team, . and
expect the; Panthers, barring some-
thing unforseen, ‘to bring home the
bacon.’ . - A

With defeat staring it in the face,
the Pitt student body was on its toes

were backing, out on the ﬁeld. There

Plans are being formulated by Mgr.
J. J. Murray, Jr., of the varsity tennis
team to hold, a preliminary tourna-
ment in the very near future and the
winner will be adjudged the school
champion. All persons wishing to‘ en-
ter the competition should give their
names to the manager. ' -

Four men of last_year’s team are
back in school, Smith, Lewis, Merritt
and Schmertz, and there is a wealth
of new material which includes Isher_-
wood of the team of two years ago.
Everything points to a successful sea-
son and under the able tutelage of D1.
T. W. Stephens, the racketers should
make a very creditable showing.

brought out some promising material
 the Freshman football, squad. All
last week the yearlings were pitted

this work,.h9wever, was on the defen-

with Bellefonte Academy at

into a machine as yet. ‘
Line Greener, But Promising.

A look at the ﬁrst year line shows
that, although it may develop into. a
powerful defense, it is still in an un-
developed stage. Maggarall, Mills
and Macbeth are the. center candi-
dates. The two guard positions are
taken care of by Clark, ~Snyd_er, Scott,
Glover, Bowser, from Johnstown, and
Bowser from’ Crafton. The tackles
appear to be a. littlebetter fortiﬁed
-than the remainder of the line. Bill
Edgar, whose football prowess is al-
ready known, will undoubtedly take
care of one of the positions. Williams,
Curtis, Simpson and Mervis are aso
‘promising tackle ‘material. Hartnett,
Clawson, ‘Storer, Lang, Hamilton, who
hails from Westminster, and Sim-
monds are‘ all end candidates.

It must‘ not be interpreted that with

such a promising squad representing;

the Freshman class that ‘they will,
from the start, be a great smooth
working machine. These men are all
new to each ‘otherand to the methods
of football which they are now learn-
ing, which proves that it will require
a few weeks before the yearlings
will be seen at their best. _ ‘
Bellefonte Saturday.

, .VVhen'the varsity steps on the ﬁeld
at ‘Syracuse next Saturday the Fresh-
men will trot out on Forbes Field to
meet Bellefonte Academy for the ﬁrst
game of their season. This will be
an excellent opportunity for them to
show just what the future holds for
them. It is urged that a large dele-
gation of students attend the game
and encourage Pitt’s future heroes in
their efforts to bring glory to the Uni-
versity in their ﬁrst attempt.

terested, he would have "been a de-
cided hit-. However, he added a little
color to what might have. been a
rather dismal day, especially for the
West Virginia. crowd. V
The Pitt line, which had caused .the
team's followers so much uneasiness,
held up its end in great style. Several
times when Pitt had the ball, the ﬁrst
defenses allowed a Mountaineer
through to break up the play, but on
the defense, the Panther linemen were.

tion. The names. of the players may
be different, but the traits of the Old
Fox showt-llrough._ — i .

Here is how they did it.

._ First Cluarter. ,

At 3 o’clock sharp, Rodgers kicked
off to Davieson the 55-yard line and
Tom swam back 28 yards. _~ '*~.stings
immediately; “kicked to "Lewl. who
brought it back 3 yards to the ‘oun-
taineer 25-yaird. mark. After_Ro- gers
and Lentz failed. to ﬁnd‘ any hr - as in
the Pitt line, King kicked to rlehart.
who dodged 18 yards through the ﬁeld
to his own 45-yard -line. ‘l-lore Jimmy
called fora trick play and trotted
around right end for a score, but the
balzl was "brought back because of off-
side. When Pitt failed to gain, Hast-
ings punted to Lewis, but the latter
fumbled and Davies recovered on the
visitors’ 35-yard line. On- theold
trick, Tom got 18 yards at end. Hast-
ings ando Morrow failed at the line.
But Davies made 11 more and a ﬁrst
gdl0Wl1 on the-1-yard line. Morrow
made a yard at guard and Hastings
went through the same place for the
ﬁrst touchdown. The ‘punt-out was
grounded. ‘ ' l

Shortly after the next kickoff, Pit
got a Mountaineer fumble on the 45-
yard mark, Davies then ran the end
for 17 yards. On the next play, Hast-
ings fumbled and West Virginia re-
covered -on- the 30-yard , line.

Score-—Pitt, 6; West Virginia, 0.

Second Quarter. .

King got off a long punt and on the
next play, Davies fumbled, the ball
going to West Virginia on the Pitt
25. Rodgers/made ﬁrs.t,dow_n on the
12-yard line, much to the discomfort
‘of the ‘Pitt contingent,» The Moun-
taineers failed at the line and, when
King fumbled, a lateral pass from
Rodgers, Pitt got the ball on its own
1,5-yard line. Hastings then pulledout
of danger. The rest of the period was
marked with fumbles to addthrills to
the thing. V ' I
‘ Score——Pitt,. 6; West Virginia, 0.

, Third Quarter.

West Virginia took the kickoff, but
failed to -make any appreciable gains.
King then punted to Davies on the
Pitt -28-yardline. Hastings punted to
the 30-yard -line, where the ball stop-
ped dead. Rodgers and Lentz tried
for it,‘ but it slipped away from them.
Along came Herb Stein, picked up the
ball, and scored. Neale tackled him
from behind,_ but they skidded over
-the goal line Hastings kickedgoal.
‘ :Score——Pitt, 13; West Virginia, 0.

Another series of punts followed.
Hastings ﬁnally tore oﬁ a long kick
to the 6-yard line, where a Pitt man
fell on the ball. For some reason, the
ball was given to Pitt. The-kick was

i low and it is thought thatdn passing

the line, it was touched by a West
Virginia forward. On the next play,
.Hastin s made a forward pass to Da-
vies, who made a great’ catch; of it
over the line. «Andy failed at goal.

Score———Pitt, 19; West Virginia, 0.
