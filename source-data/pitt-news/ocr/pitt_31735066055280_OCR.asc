Sen. John Glenn will return to space and help conduct Pitt’s experiments

Erin Llndeman
Senlor Staff Wrlter

The Space Shuttle Discovery’s
launch this afternoon has attracted wide-
spread attention because Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, will return to space for
the first time since 1962, when he was
among the f1rst Americans to orbit the
earth.

But the ﬂight also has a connection

to Pitt: The 77-year-old Glenn is one of T

two astronauts on board who will con-
duct experiments for the University’s
department of biological sciences.

Pedro Duque of Spain is the mission
specialist scheduled to begin the experi-
ments, and Glenn will serve as his back-
up. They will crystallize several different
proteins in the weightless conditions of
the orbiting space shuttle.

“We put months of work into being
ready, so if anything, it gets more excit-
ing each time we do it,” said Pitt
Professor John Rosenberg, head of the
project. “Of course, with John Glenn on
board, this will get a lot of attention, and
the potential of having him involved is
very exciting as well.”

These experiments are the first stage
in an ongoing effort to visualize the
atomic structure of protein molecules.
Learning this structure will help scien-
tists to understand how the molecules
work in living bacteria cells.

During the experiments, the crystals
of each protein will be separated and
placed into an X-ray diffraction appara-

tus that will illuminate them. A comput-
er will analyze the patterns that become
visible and produce the atomic structure
of the protein.

Crystallographers across the world
have discussed a theory that crystals
grown in orbit produce a better-reﬂected
X-ray beam. The more patterns provided
by the X—rays, the sharper and more
detailed the computer image will be, said
Roger Hendrix, a Pitt professor working
on the ground phase of the project.

Rosenberg works in the department
of biological sciences. He works on the
project with Hendrix and Professor
Jeffrey Brodsky from biological sci-
ences, and Professor Saleem Khan from
the department of molecular genetics
and biochemistry in the School of
Medicine.

One of the proteins the scientists will
study is the EcoRI endonuclease protein,
a gene-splicing enzyme. The researchers
are hoping to obtain better crystals of the

enzyme on the mission. Specimens that V

are joined to several different DNA mol-
ecules will make them better.

Another protein they will study is
GroEL, which assists other proteins to
“fold up” into their ﬁnal shape after
being made in the cell.

Hendrix said the lack of gravity
works better for some crystals than it
does for others.

“This is the first time we’ll get to see
[GroEL proteins] in action,” Hendrix
said. “GroEL had been in space before,
and its results were encouraging.”

A similar protein, BiP, will also be
studied aboard the shuttle. BiP is a pro-
tein known as a chaperone protein, said
Hendrix, who noted that experimenting
on the shuttle will be a great opportunity

method shines a beam of X-rays onto the

data to analyze its atomic structure.

Fire guts third-floor apartment

Isadora Murphy

Contributing Editor

Pitt junior Sharan Watson
awoke at 5 a.m. Wednesday to an
urgent banging on his front door.

His Meyran Avenue apartment
was slowly filling with smoke as he
opened the door. A city police offi-
cer stood in the hallway trying to
evacuate the building. As Watson’s
neighbors ran out into the street, he
was told the apartment building
next to him was on fire.

Watson followed
outside as firefighters from
Oakland, Bloomfield, Uptown,
Lawrenceville and Greenfield
fought to quell the ﬂames at 253
Meyran Ave.

“The whole street was covered
with smoke,” said Watson, who
lives at 255 Meyran Ave. “People
were being carried away in stretch-
ers.”

The two—alarm fire that took
half an hour to get under control is
under investigation, but arson is
suspected. No one was injured, and
the Red Cross provided relief to the
tenants left homeless.

No names of building occupants
have been released, but Battalion
Chief Art George of the fire depart-

everybody

ment presumed the tenants to be
college age. The third—floor tenant
had to climb out his window and
use his fire escape to free himself.
The stairwell was engulfed in
smoke, and he had no other way
out.

‘‘If he hadn’t known where his
fire escape was for sure, he might
not have escaped,” said George.

Four people were in the build-
ing at 5:15 a.m. when the first
alarm sounded. Firefighters con-
tained the fire by 5:49, but it took
until 8:30 am for them to feel that it
was securely extinguished.

Authorities strongly believe this
incident was arson because of the
nature of the fire.

“There aren’t that many fires
that involve the building itself,”
George said. “Most are started by
candles and incense. This was a
rather large fire to begin with, and
it grew very fast. That’s why we see
it as a possible arson. When we got
there, the whole third floor had fire
coming out the back, front and
roof.” “‘

Watson, whose apartment suf-
fered no damage, must continue to
live next to the charred ruins.

Director Ron OJ Parson (right) gives stage directions to graduate students Javon
Johnson (middle) and Derrick Sanders in Pitt's productionot "Before It Hits Home.”

Pitt play deals with bisexuality
and AIDS in black community

Ariel Rostow

For The Pitt News

One night before the preview of
“Before It Hits Home,” the director
instructed the cast to to read the audience’s
emotions and experience the feelings they
emit.

In black-rimmed reading glasses and a
stingy brim hat, director Ron. OJ Parson
told the cast members that the feelings of
the play are starting to emerge. He referred
to the cast members not by their names, but
by their characters because he was trying to
reach the characters.

Parson, director of more than 40 pro-
ductions, including the award winning “Let
Me Live,” came from Chicago to direct
“Before It Hits Home.”

Jovan Johnson and Derrick Sanders,
the show’s two leading actors, are Pitt grad-
uate students. They had the opportunity to
select their own director as part of their the-
sis project in the masters of ﬁne arts pro-

“Before It Hits Home” was written in
1991 by Cheryl West, anAfrican—American
playwright. Parson said the play, on a sun-
ple level, is about a bisexual, African-
American man who contracts HIV. Wendal
Bailey, played by Johnson, “wants to
reestablish a relationship with his family
and go home to die,” said Parson.

“The AIDS crisis is a very serious
issue that needs to be addressed at all lev-
els,” Parson said. The play shows that any-
one could have AIDS and be affected by
the disease, he added

In addition to delivering a powerful
message about AIDS, “Before It Hits
Home” intentionally corresponds with
Pitt’s theme—of—the-season plays about the
American family.

Johnson and Sanders are the only Pitt
graduate students acting in the production’.
The rest of the cast consists of actors in the
community who volunteer their time.

Carolyn Schrier, stage manager and
third-year undergraduate student at Pitt,
said rehearsals have been going well. It’s an
“emotional subject,” and the actors “get
into it a lot,” she said.

'_ The most enjoyable moment for
Schrier has been “watching it all come
together, watching it all ﬂow,” she said

Johnson said rehearsals have been
“difficult at times.” During a few
rehearsals, some of the actors began to have
emotional breakdowns because of the sen-
sitive subject matter. The cast has “lost one
actor because of the content of the script,”
said Johnson. '

The heavier scenes at the end of the
play, “are most demanding for me as an
actor,” Johnson said. He explained that for
him, “it’s not diﬂicult to play someone who
has an illness — it is difﬁcult to play some-
one who is bisexual.”

Johnson, who has scenes depicting a
physically and emotionally intimate rela-
tionship with another man, said he had to
“convert to playing a lifestyle that I am not
familiar with.”

Johnson said he is always nervous
before he performs. Nervousness indicates
excitement and enthusiasm, and he looks
for ways it can work for him and not
against him.

Parson recommends the play to every-
one but especially members of the gay and
African—American communities.

The play opens Friday at 8 p.m.
Tickets can be purchased by calling 624»

For The Pitt News

Whether the word “sex” should be
eliminated from a civil—rights law was
the argument that led Pitt to the top of
a debate tournament at Duquesne
University.

Heather Logue and Laura
Hutchings were ranked first as a team
in the novice category at the touma—
ment over the weekend. Arguing a case
in the first round, they beat the Liberty
team that topped them in the ﬁnals at
the King’s College tournament a few
weeks ago. This was their second
intercollegiate debate tournament and
their second appearance in the final
round.

Melissa Monteres and Denise
Olczak won five out of their six pre-

 

liminary rounds but lost in the quarter-
finals. The junior—varsity team of Joe
Pruszynski and Hope Guy made its
first appearance in the tournament.

In addition to Pitt’s team wins,
Hutchings was named the third-best
speaker in the division and Logue was
named the sixth-best. Denise Olczak
also placed in the individual speaker
category, grabbing 10th place.

Logue and Hutchings argued in the
final round for the elimination of the
word “sex” from Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act because it was “originally
added as a joke to defeat the [law], but
it passed regardless,” Hutchings said.

The case asserted that eliminating
the word would protect moreicitizens
by eliminating gender discrimination.

“They have a great case. It’s one of
the most strategic cases this year that
any school has put together,” said
Omri Ceren, a varsity debater who
helped coach the teams.

Even with a strong affirmative
case on her side, Hutchings was not
expecting to win the tournament. She
cited her lack of collegiate debating
experience as the reason but added that
she and Logue have been working as a
team since high school. Their experi-
ence working together added to their
advantage as partners in the William
Pitt Debating Union.

“[The team of Logue and
Hutchings] is a balanced team with
multiple strengths,” said Gordon
Mitchell, Pitt assistant professor and
director of debate.

This tournament included only
junior-varsity and novice divisions.
Varsity debaters in the William Pitt
Debating Union helped the other teams
out with their arguments instead of
debating themselves.

Coach Marcy Halpin was pleased
with the cooperation of the varsity
team in preparation for the tournament.

“There was incredible team unity

P shown with the varsity debaters coach-

ing throughout the weekend, cutting
cards and strategizing,” she said.
“They made a real contribution to the
team success at the tournament.”

This weekend, the debate team
will attend ,a tournament at Harvard

FIRE ~

“I’m a little worried about the
safety of everybody in here,” said
Watson. “It was disturbing that it
was probably arson. The front door
doesn’t have locks. It could have
easily been my building.”

Neil McEwen, the owner of the
two apartment buildings at 253 and
255 Meyran Ave., argued that there
was a lock on the apartment that
caught fire and that tenants chose to
leave the doors unlocked so that
friends have easy access. He is
aware that the lock on Watson’s
apartment is broken and said he
plans to fix it.

McEwen is still in shock and is
trying to deal with the situation.
“When your property is burned to
the ground, you feel like you’ve
been violated in some way,” said
McEwen.

McEwen doesn’t know the exact
details of damages and costs, but
the fire department said it would

take weeks if not longer to restore —

the building. McEwen is returning
to his tenants their entire security
deposits so they can find places to
stay.

Mike Fagone, who lives in

VV1th the Middle East Peace Accord
signed Friday and escalating tension in the
West Bank dominating newspaper head-
lines, two lectures on Palestine at Pitt
today and Friday aim to inform students
and faculty about what’s going on.

Pitt’s Muslim Students Association
presents “Israel  Palestine  Peace
\V1thout Justice?” tonight from 8 to 10
p.m. in David Lawrence Hall. Harem
Bazyan and former U.S. Rep. Paul

‘Findley, R-Ill., will discuss media bias

toward the Israeli point of view and abus-
es carried out by Israeli authorities in
Palestine.

“Palestine is an issue that has been in
the public eye for some time,” said Sally
Sarieh, assistant coordinator of the event
and a member of MSA. “Rarely do we get
to see the Palestinian point of View in [the
mainstream] media.”

Bazyan is a well-known academic
and expert on Middle Eastern affairs. He
has spoken in television interviews, giv-
ing his views on the Middle East peace
process.

Findley, chairman of the Human
Relations Commission and the Council
for the National Interest, is an advocate of

active American participation in the
region.

“Our main angle on the whole event
is to encourage political participation in
the issue,” said Ammar Hindi, MSA pro-
grams director. “We also want to show
how it is relevant to people here.”

Pitt’s Nationality Room program, the
Consul General of Israel in Philadelphia,
and Pitt’s political honor society, Pi Sigma
Alpha, present “Prospects for a
Palestinian State” Friday from 2:30 to 5
p.m. in the English Nationality Room in
the Cathedral of Learning. Professor
Barry Rubin and ambassador Clovis
Maksoud will discuss differing points of
view on this topic.

Rubin is the author of several books
on U.S. foreign policy and the Middle
East. He is a senior resident scholar of the
Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies
at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and has
been published in The New York limes,
The Washington Post and other media

Maksoud is a professor of intema-
tional relations and director of the Center
for the Global South at American
University in Washington, D.C. He is a
Lebanese national and former representa-
tive of the League of Arab States to the
United States and United Nations from
1979 until _1990.

Maksoud originally intended to make
a speech on Arabic culture for the
Syria/Lebanon Nationality Room’s armu-
al lecture series, but when the Israeli
Consul General proposed bringing Rubin
to Pitt, the Nationality Rooms program
arranged for both speak together on
Palestinian affairs.

“It’s certainly a hot topic in the news.
It has to do with two constituencies: Arab
and Israeli,” said Maxine Bruhns, director
of the Nationality Rooms program. “If
students are either Arab or Israeli, they
should come.”

However, Maksoud, who is pro-
Palestine, made it clear to the organizers
that he would not speak at the same time
as Rubin, who is pro-Israel. To accommo-
date this request, Rubin will speak ﬁom
2:30 to 3:30, and Maksoud will speak
from 4 to 5 p.m.

“The peace process has been lifted to
another level,” Bruhns said. “These men
are great representatives of either side.”

Organizers of both events stressed the
relevance of the Middle East question to
Americans, especially students, in matters
of religion and American foreign policy.

“It’s very important for religious rea-
sons, and Palestine is one of the most
important regions in the Middle East, both
strategically and militarily,” Hindi said.

Clinton scandal should have no
bearing on Nov. 3 elections

Can we forget about sex
already?

The National Republican
Congressional Committee is still
obsessed with President Clinton’s
affair with Monica Lewinsky and
is opening a nationwide, $10 mil-
lion advertising blitz poking at the
scandal, despite the fact that the
elections on Nov. 3 have barely
anything to do with the president.

Republicans are avoiding the
real issues by tarring Democratic
contenders for Congress, gover-
nor and state legislature with the
presidential scandal brush. While
patting themselves on the back for
general, broad “achievements” in
Congress (reducing big govern-
ment, etc.), Republicans are ditch-
ing political principles for moral
ones in order to appease their
right-wing backers.

Despite their rigorous ad cam-
paign, the intended effect (appeal-
ing to the voters’ “moral” sensi-
bility) will not work. Everyone
already knows that Clinton lied to
the American people. Most peo-
ple know Clinton is a cheating
weasel with loose morals, loose
ways and the sexual appetite of a
buffalo. '

Republican strategists had
originally planned not to use the
president as a target, fearing a

possible voter backlash.
However, because of recent sur-
veys, Republicans have changed
their minds. They feel the public
won’t be armoyed by their blatant
political opportunism and there-
fore vote for a Democrat instead.

Republicans should just cam-
paign as usual — stick with the
“less tax, more freedom” rhetoric,
bend over for business interests,
and stand up for preserving the
family unit. While attacking the
president is in line with their fam-
ily—values campaign, they are still
using a scapegoat whose only
connection with the Nov. 3 elec-
tions is his being a Democrat.

Democrats, of course, don’t
hold a monopoly on adulterous
relationships in Washington.
Apparently, one only has to look
as close as Senate Judiciary
Committee Chair Dan Burton, a
Republican who has an illegiti-
mate child from an adulterous
affair in the 19603.

For the Nov. 3 elections, vot-
ers should go to the polls without
Clinton’s shenanigans on their
minds.

Republican, Democrat and
Libertarian candidates should be
chosen according to their political
platform, not by their opinion of
the president’s sex life.

The air in Pittsburgh is getting too clean.

On most days, I can clearly see the top of
the Cathedral from almost any part of campus,
even from Downtown.

Long gone are the smoggy, foggy after-
noons, when I could sit with my girlfriend on
Flagstaff Hill and watch the beautiful orange-
ish, reddish, brownish haze over Pittsburgh,
with a huge, unnatural red sun.

Environmental regulations are getting
stricter, technology is getting better and clean-
er, and one thinks we have completely lost our
right to pollute. The average emissions of
unburned or partially binned fuel, referred to
as VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and
carbon monoxide from a typical automobile
have been reduced by approximately 80 per-
cent in the last 30 years. Although we com-
pensated for it by driving more than twice as

A many miles as 30 years ago, it is still not

enough: The air is getting clean-
er and cleaner every year, and
we have to do something about

It. VOJTISEK-LOM

Luckily, the largest source
of air pollution, the internal
combustion engine, is still ﬁnrily in our hands.
Despite mandatory emission inspections and
other Environmental Protect Agency efforts to
lessen our rights to produce toxic, hazardous
gases, we have plenty opportunities to pro-
duce ample amounts of VOCs, carbon
monoxide and nitrogen oxides. And there are
many ways to do it.

First, drive your car as much as you can.
Don’t even think about stopping by the Pitt
Parking and Transportation Department on
Forbes Avenue; the people there are just too
nice, and they will offer you bike maps and
lockers, carpools, vanpools, bus schedules.
They will show you how happy you can be
without driving a car.

No way. If you don’t have a car, get one,
preferably an old clunker. Drive it everywhere
you go, and then cruise around town just for
fun. Don’t even think of taking a bus, even if
it is faster, cheaper and less hassle. If you have
an urge to ride your bicycle, load it in your car,
drive to a distant place, and ride it there. Make
as many trips as you can. Starting and rtmning
a cold engine produces several times as much

emissions as when the engine is warm. Go to

Pouting our air. is easy

MICHAL

 

(E

the grocery store, let the engine cool off, then
start it again, and take off to go return a movie.
Never give rides to your friends: Make them
drive their own cars. One person per car.

Maintenance and driving habits are also
crucial. Poorly maintained cars can produce a
hundred’ times as much emissions as vehicles
in good order. Repair only what you absolute-
ly have to in order to keep the car running, and
never do any preventive maintenance. If your
car works well, help it by bending the tips of
spark plugs, disconnecting vacuum lines or
wires here and there, making holes in the
exhaust, and adjusting the ignition timing by a
random amount.

When you’re driving, the computer in
your car optimizes the engine so it produces
the least amount of pollution. The only excep-
tion is the full-throttle mode, when you get the
maximum power regardless of the emissions.
Therefore, use full-throttle
every time you .accelerate,
even if it means slamming on
your brakes at the next light.
You can at least double your
emissions; a guy from the
California Air Resources Board managed to
raise his emissions more than 10 times this
way. When you cannot go full-throttle, move
your car by giving it short bursts of gas, and
vary the position of your foot on the accelera-
tor all the time so that the computer "never has
time to “optimize.”

If you are lucky enough to drive a bus or
a truck with a diesel engine, never turn it off.
Not only does an idling diesel engine produce
a miraculous amount of nitrogen oxides, but
prolonged idling causes the engine to wear out
sooner. And the more wear on the engine, the
more pollution it can generate.

Compared to relatively clean cars and
trucks, small engines are a complete heaven.
Burning a gallon of fuel in a new lawn mower
produces, on average, ﬁve times as much
VOCs and carbon monoxide as an average
car, and perhaps even much more if you mow
with an old beast blowing out beautiful blue
smoke. Two-stroke engines are even better.
About a third of the gas just goes straight
through, and they burn oil, too. A typical two-

A challenge to the House liberals

John. Lacny

Columnist

Two months after the rocket attacks on
Sudan and Afghanistan, there are still can-
tankerous -little subversives like me who
won’t let the issue die. Make no mistake
about it: You’re going to have to suffer our
presence for a long time to come.

This time, though, the oﬂicial lies have
ban so transparent that all but the most
craven fellow travelers of U.S. imperialism
in the media are having second thoughts.
The Sudanese phamraceutical facility that
was reduced to rubble by the United States
on Aug. 20 was almost certainly civilian, as
the london Observer alleged weeks ago. In
the Oct. 12 issue of The New Yorker,
Seymour Hersh comes about as close to
proving a negative as possible in suggest-
ing that the Sudanese facility was not pro-
ducing chemical weapons. Hersh quotes an
unidentiﬁed CIA source as saying: “I hope
we were right. But who knows?”

Quite cavalier, considering the likeli-
hood that the CIA provided the Clinton
administration with misinformation that
served as propaganda cover for the destruc-
tion of a factory which was producing
badly needed medicines in a deeply irnpov—
erished region of the world. But then again,

no one has ever seriously accused the CIA

of sophisticated thinking.

Political commentators, on the other
hand, pride themselveson their keen eye
for propaganda. Yet when Clinton adminis-
tration oﬁicials claimed they had “convinc-
ing evidence” that the Sudanese factory
was producing VX gas, virtually every
pundit in the American mainstream media
proved incredulous.

I would add that this was a credulity
not shared by the general public, which
viewed the whole event with a healthy
skepticism. Nevertheless, the house liberals
at The Pitt News were not immune to such
intellectual servility. On Aug. 31, Heather
Barnett wrote, “It’s pretty clear now that the
missile strikes made on terrorist sites in
Sudan and Afghanistan were warranted,”
and on Sep. 14, Michael Berquist glibly
referred to “terrorist camps in Sudan and
Afghanistan.”

There’s a term for people who accept
and propagate the lies that powerful people
use to cover up their crimes. They’re called
apologists. I hereby publicly challenge my
fellow Pitt News columnists to either pony
up with the evidence supporting their
claims or else renotmce them.

John Lacny won ’t be getting any Christmas
cards from the Democratic Leadership
Council this year.

stroke engine can crank out, per gallon of
fuel, 100 times as much VOCs and 50
times as much carbon monoxide as a
newer, well-maintained automobile.
While burning a. gallon of fuel in a

"weed-eater or in a chain saw can be tire-

some, a snowmobile or an outboard
marine engine will do the job with much
less effort. Most of the unhealthy smog
and ground-level ozone forms in early
aftemoons on hot summer days, and that’s
when every bit of emissions counts. And
while weed-eating on hot summer after-
noons is no fun, it is the prime time for a
long cruise up and down the Allegheny
River on a boat or on a jet-ski.

Write your local congressmen, too.
Ask for reformulated gasoline with
MFBE, which not only does not help
reduce emissions, but also causes out-
breaks of asthma and puts entire towns in
a wonderful sleepy, do—nothing daze. Tell
your legislators you love the current emis-
sions testing. Since the idle-only testing is
completely inadequate for modern
engines, the tests are fairly ineffective,
leaving some of the best polluters on the
road, while making the environmentalists
happy that something is being done.

Another good strategy is to request
more spending on nonrenewable altema-
tive fuels, burned in existing ineﬂicient

automobiles. This also keeps the environ-
mentalists happy while diverting large
sums of money from potentially harmful
projects —— that is, projects that actually
could reduce emissions by a great amount,
like mass transit, high-speed trains, or
‘ZOO-mile-per—gallon com-booze-powered
hypercars. Alternative fuel vehicles do not
displace old, poorly maintained clunkers,
but only new, clean vehicles that would
have been purchased otherwise; therefore,
their emissions beneﬁts are 

If there is still money left for trans-
portation improvements, spend it on more
roads. More roads generate more traﬂic,
which will generate more pollution. True,
some roads will become less congested
for a while, but that will only encourage
more people to drive, quickly bringing
things back to normal.

Do whatever you can do, and please
tell your friends. It takes quite a lot of con-
cemed, educated people to make any dif-
ference. And only through the combined
effort of many people, through wise deci-
sions in our everyday life, we can have a

wonderfully dirty air, with the beautiful _

Supper! CWO's "Take Back Ilie Night"

‘ Chris Griswold
Columnlst

The cries of angry women rang through
the streets of Oakland one night last semes-
ter. The protesters, members of the Campus
Women’s Organization, shouted, disrupting
my television viewing. I was not happy.

The protesters’ shouts were loud,
indeed; their use of a megaphone in the
Litchﬁeld Towers lobby helped to dnown out
the sounds of Fox television in my dorm
room A mixture of school-based stress and a
“Simpsons”-inspired lack of mental stability
brought me to ﬁnd myself minutes later
amid the throng below. For some reason I
willingly placed myself in the middle of that
which caused so much umest in me. I was
part of the Take Back the Night march.

The protesters shouted, their chants loud
and rhythmic. They condemned date rape. I
thought to myself, “Why do they need to
marchaboutthis?”Iﬁgureddaterapeispret-
ty obviously a bad thing and that a march
was unnecessary. I felt even the men com-
mitting the act knew it was wrong.

I shouted along with them. I didn’t have
the chant sheets they had, listing several
“Yea women!” cheers and such, so I made
up my own. “I forgot my chant sheet!” was
actually one of the messages I yelled A
believer in simplicity, I also shouted, “I’m
angry!” and, “I need attention!”

We marched across the campus,
expelling the message of deﬁance. Often,
fellow students poked their heads out of their

windows and yelled back Their chants’

lacked the creative, rhythmic qualities of the
CWO’s; they tended to just yell, “Shut up!”
I felt a connection to these fellow pissed—olf
people. I think I may have smiled

As the march ended on the steps ofthe
William Pitt Union, a follow-up meeting
was armounced.
“It’s so ‘easy to
make ﬁm of things i
you don’t under-
stand,” I thought
to myself, seeing a
potential eolurrm. I
decided to make it
harder on myself. I
decided to learn
more.

I found the
room in which the meeting was to be held
and watched as people ﬁlled it. I took notes
onthemeetingtryingtogetnamesand
quotes right. But soon my notes took on a
dilferent theme; my outlook was changing.

I listened to the speakers. They told of
date-rape warning signs and what to doif
women feel unsafe. I. suddenly realized that
just because I’m intelligent —— and that’s
debatable, especially considering my 

freactiontothemarch—doesn’tmean

 

everyone is. Those who would force them-
selves upon another human, who would
invade another’s body and wantonly disre-
gard that person’s value lack the reasoning of
nomral people. They may not actually real-
ize how wrong it is. I knew that this was one
of the reasons behind the march.

Those attending were asked to speak
about why they were there. I was particular-
ly touched by the man who showed up with
his girlﬁiend. He
said he did not live
in Pittsburgh but
that his girlfriend
was a Pitt student,
He told how he
worried about her
in Oakland at
night, and he just
wanted to show
some support.

This man was
every man, the woman every woman. Their
fears and concerns were extremely real to
me, to any guy, actually, who has someone
he cares for here at Pitt.

He wanted to show her support, he said
Andthatwas whattheevent was truly about.
Their cheers and chants were a beacon of
friendship, of sisterhood and understanding,
to the residents in the dorms, the students in
theCathedralandtheGreeksinthefrathous—

es. They were saying, “We won’t let this

happen anymore. We’re here for each other.”

I came to understand and respect this
group of young women and men. They
came together not in anger and hate as some
of the organizations on campus do, but in
love and friendship. It was really quite an
amazing night for me as I realized how
wrong I had been.

I had always heard and repeated hollow

words about how college opens you up to .

new experiences. I wrote numerous essays in
my quest for scholarships oonceming the
meeting and strengthening of differing
views. I had never really thought about it,
however, and I suddenly believed it. It
almost brought me to tears.

fury, so sure of myself and self-righteous.
And there it was that a closed-minded person
fell, replaced by a more mature, more
knowledgeable person

And you know, as amazingly brash and
childish as I may have been that night, I don’t

regret it because despite my feelings, I was,

welcomed and greeted wholeheartedly.
They changed my mind, and it actually took
a little yelling.

Donovan McNabb
and Matt Lytle
B head-to-head

Four years ago, a late-season battle of
young Big East quarterbacks took place at
Pitt Stadium.

On one side, the visiting Syracuse
Orangemen lined up behind 18-year-old
Donovan McNabb, who was already sur-
prising veterans and coaches all over the
nation with accurate passes and inspired
scrambling.

On the other side sat Matt Lytle.

Plain old Matt Lytle.

Nobody knew who the poor kid was.
The 1995 Syracuse game marked his ﬁrst
appearance in the Panther starting lineup.

While McNabb steered a team of
Orangemen that ended the season with a 41-
0 win over Clemson in the Gator Bowl,
Lytle split time with John Ryan and B.P.
(Before Pistol) Pete Gonzalez under center
as the Panthers tumbled to a 2-9 record .

The game itself was a 42-10 laugher,
with McNabb going 12-15 in the air and
spending much of his time handing off to the
Syracuse ninning backs. Pitt’s running
defense was, to put it gently, lower than
ninth in the nation at that point in the season.

My memory of the game has faded
(yes, I was in the press box, further proving
myself as the resident Methuselah of the
sports department), but I do remember
watching McNabb and thinking, “I can’t
believe Pitt has to put up with this kid for
three more years.”

That’s one of the three memories I can
drag up from that contest. The second one
— the fact that Johrmy Majors almost
tripped over my foot on the way to the podi-
um in the old Pitt football media room —
doesn’t have too much to do with the 1998
Panthers.

Here’s the third thing: I remember Matt
Lytle putting McNabb to shame.

‘ The freshman Panther completed 20 of
38 passes, including one touchdown. He
was intercepted only once by a highly tout-
ed Syracuse rush defense that faced a lowly
touted Pitt offensive line.

When the Orangemen crush did break
through, Lytle dodged them with moves that
could make Barry Sanders scratch his hel-
met. At 225 pounds, Lytle has never been
confused with a scatback, but he cut better
than Demetrius Harris (remember him?)
could on the rain-soaked Pitt Stadium turf
four years ago.

After his impressive outing, the quarter-
back rnade a statement that, going into a
weekend full of references to the occult,
seems downright scary in hindsight;

Staff Wrlter

The Pitt Panthers will try to bounce
back from an upset loss to Rutgers
Saturday as they travel to Syracuse to
take on the Orangemen. This game will
be a battle of the first-place team in the
Big East against the conference’s base-
ment dweller.

The Panthers come into the game
with a 2-4 overall record, which
includes an 0-2 mark in Big East play.
Syracuse is trying to improve its 4-2
record. The Orangemen are undefeated
in conference play at 2-0.

Head coach Paul Pasqualoni owes
most of his team’s success this season
to his offense. The Orangemen rank
12th in the country in total offense.
Their rushing attack comes into the
game with the eighth spot in the coun-
try, averaging 236.2 yards per game on
the ground.

That rushing attack is effective
because of the abilities of Donovan
McNabb. The senior quarterback’s ver-
satility fuels the offense. He can be the
perfect option quarterback, or he can
burn defenses with the deep ball.
McNabb has a pair of quality backs
behind him in Kyle McIntosh and Rob

Konrad. McIntosh
leads the team with
419 yards rushing.
He is averaging 5.7
yards per carry, and
he has scored four
t o u c h d o w n s .
Konrad, a Doak g
Walker Award can-
didate, has rushed
for 269 yards and a
team-leading five >
touchdowns.

When McNabb
drops back to pass,
the Panthers must

focus on wide
receiver Kevin
Johnson. The former quarterback

recruit leads the Orangemen with 32
catches for 463 yards and five touch-
downs.

The big question mark for Pitt this
week is at quarterback. There is specu-
lation that junior-college transfer Matt
O’Connor will get his ﬁrst start this
week, after Matt Lytle struggled in the
upset loss to Rutgers. Whichever quar-
terback gets the nod will have to get off
to a quick start in order to quiet the
crowd at the Carrier Dome.

Pitt men's hoops team ready to hit the hardwood

Zachariah Blott
Staff Writer

With the beginning of every sports
season, fans and journalists alike play
expert and try to be the ﬁrst ones to pick
who will win it all, who the unexpected
ﬂops will be, and which players will
have breakthrough years.

Well, Dick Vitale and the college
basketball season are upon us, with
exhibition games starting in less than a
week, so it’s time to take a look at what
the Pitt Panthers have in store for hoop
fans this side of the Cavaliers.

Overall

Pitt is coming off of an injury-rid-
dled season, in which it ﬁnished with a
Big East-low six league wins, compared
to 13 conference loses.

The Panthers return all ﬁve starters,
though, and are being mentioned by a
few basketball analysts as having a shot
at ﬁnishing in the top 25 and earning a
spot in the NCAA tournament, some-
thing they haven’t done since 1993. For
that to happen, the team will have to
depend on its deep and versatile back-
court, which will play behind a thin and
oft—injured frontcourt.

Frontcourt
After losing 7-footer Marc
Blount to the NBA Draft after his
sophomore season in ‘97, head coach
Ralph Willard had to turn to sophomore
Isaac Hawkins (6—foot—8, 210 pounds)
to play the center position last year.
Although he was undersized for the
position and had to play against oppos-
ing centers as muclysas ﬁve inches taller
than himself, Hawkins stepped up to the
challenge in a big ii/ay and led the Big
East in rebound; g, averaging 9.7
rebounds per league game. In addition,
he made 53.7 percent of his shots (sec-_
ond in the league)  blocked 1.7 shots
per game (fourth in the league). He’ll
have to play center again in his junior
year, but his conﬁdence is up, and he’s
playing under the hoop in practices like
he owns the paint. Look for him to be

one of the two best insiders in the Big
East this year, earning second— or third-
team All-Big East honors.

Sophomore Attila Cosby (6-9, 210
pounds) will be asked to pick up where
he left off last season, when he started
all 27 games as a freshman. This athlet-
ic power forward averaged 9.4 points
and 4.7 rebounds per game last year,
respectable numbers for a freshman in
the Big East. His shooting accuracy is
phenomenal for a big man, and he ﬁn-
ished the year averaging a little more
than two blocks per game, second most
in the Big East. He tells me he’s worked
on both his inside and outside games in
the off-season, and fans will see an
improvement in his play. What he may
need the most work on, however, is
increasing his weight and adding more
strength to his skinny frame.

Unfortunately for Willard, the team
has only one more true forward, leaving
an awfully thin frontcourt. Lucky for
him, the other forward, newcomer
Chris Seabrooks (6-9, 230 pounds), is
both strong and athletic. How strong?
He can bench press over 300 pounds, a
decent amount for football players. How
athletic? The first time I asked senior
point guard Vonteego Cummings what
Seabrooks’ strengths were, he named
athleticism and speed when I was
expecting a ‘comment on Seabrooks’
huge upper body. For now, though,
Seabrooks is sidelined after tearing the
anterior cruciate ligament in his right
knee last season. Willard expects
Seabrooks to be back in December; until
then, Hawkins and Cosby will have to
stay out of foul trouble, stay healthy, and
count on the backcourt to carry a lot of
the load. v

Backcourt

The group of
guards Pitt has this
year has already‘
received national
attention as one of
the top backcourts
in college basket-
ball. And this
recognition would
not exist without
one man -
V o n’ t e e g o
Cummings (6-4,
185 pounds).

Cummings did
it all last year, aver-
aging 19.5 points
(third in the Big
East), 5.9 assists
(second in the Big
East), 2.4 steals 
(second in the
league), and 41

Guard Vonteego Cummings hopes to lead the Pitt

ESPNCVS Jay Panthers to a Big East title this year.

Bilas and a few others have predicted
that Cummings will‘ be a second-team
All-American this season. And as Pitt
fans have come to expect when things
start looking good, Cummings got
injured in practice Friday. He broke his
left hand and is expected to be off the

-court for two weeks. It seems the only

question fans will have about
Cummings once he comes back is

whether his three-point shooting
improved in the off-season before his
injury. This question won’t be answered
until the season begins, though, because
of how difficult it is to judge long-dis-
tance shooting from practices.

Piﬂ invades the land of orange

Jay Yander.

Staff Wrlter

Creativity wasn’t really booming at
Syracuse University in 1978.

When a new nickname was needed,»

the school turned to its official color as
inspiration. But instead of inspiring,_the
color actually became the nickname of
the university. ,

' In 1890, Syracuse adopted the color
orange as the only
school color for one
simple reason:
Baird ’s \ College
Manual 0 revealed
that no other
American university
at the time had
orange as its only
color.

The 9 color

change was probably
a good idea because
before the switch,
Syracuse had graced
the playing ﬁelds in
the color combo of rose pink and pea
green. _ »
“What do you expect?_,” said Sue
Cornelius Edson, Syracuse athletics
communications director. “It was the
1800s after all. Fashion tastes were a
whole lot different.”

Until 1978, Syracuse was known as
the Saltine Warriors. The name came

from an American Indian tribe native to
central New York.

Out of respect, the Syracuse admin-
istration removed the tribe’s name from
the sports teams in 1978. In place of it,
the university took its official color and
added “men” to it.

“Officials. thought ‘ Saltine
Warriors’ was disrespectful to the Indian
heritage of New York state and Indian
heritages from all over,” Edson said.

Two years
later, Syracuse’s
mascot, Otto the
Orangeman, made
his on-ﬁeld debut at
“The Horseshoe” on
-the campus of Ohio
State University.
The Orangemen lost
despite Otto’s antics,
31-21.

Syracuse is a
long way from the
days in the trenches
with its rose pink

but it will never forget the days of being
known as the Saltine Warriors.

“We were proud to represent the
Indian tradition,” Edson said. “It was

time, though, to change for the good of '

history.” -

“Orangemen” may not be the most
original nickname in sports, but it has
gotten the job done in Syracuse.

Ketchen. Murphy ﬁnally seems to be
returning to the form that made him the
best receiver in the Big East last year.
He led the team with six catches for 73
yards against Rutgers.

Grim has led the team all year. He
has 36 catches for 619 yards and seven
touchdowns on the season. He ranks

first in the conference in receptions and

receiving yards per game.

If the Panthers are going to pull off
the upset, they will have to exploit
Syracuse’s one weakness: the
Orangeman defense, which is ranked
76th in the country.

Pitt’s defense, on the other hand,
has been strong all year. The Panthers
are ranked 10th in the nation in total
defense, allowing an average of 279.5
yards per game. -

The defense is lead by linebacker

Phil Clarke, whose 53 tackles are tops _

on the «team. Hank Poteat has been a
savior at comerback for the Panthers.
He has five interceptions in six games,
and his average of 0.86 interceptions
per game is the highest in the country.

Pasqualoni is 7-0 all time against
Pitt. The series is tied at 25—25—3, but
the Orangemen haven’t lost to the
Panthers since 1989. Syracuse needs
the win to continue its march toward a
spot in the Bowl Championship Series,
while Pitt needs to win four out of its
last ﬁve games to be eligible for the
postseason.

lack of frontcourt players, is sophomore

mom PAGE 11

A Ricardo Greer (6-5, 225 pounds).

Greer drove other teams mad last year
with his ability to post up guards
because of his sheer strength, and his
ability to isolate opposing forwards on
the outside because of his speed and
agility, earning him All—Big East
Freshman honors. His three-point
shooting was suspect last year, but he’ll
probably play more minutes under the
hoop as a forward because of the thin
frontcourt. Look for Greer to improve
on his 12 points and seven rebounds per
game.

V The ﬁfth starter behind Hawkins,
Cosby, Cummings-and Greer probably
will be junior Kellii Taylor (6-1, 180
pounds). He was injured for most of last
season and never quite got into the
swing of things.

His freshman year was one to
remember, though. In ‘96-’97, Taylor
was the only player in the nation to ﬁn-
ish with more than 100 steals (101),
earning him praise as one of the top
defenders in the Big East, if not the
nation. He’s back to 100 percent from
last year’s foot injuries _and will be
counted on to hound opposing guards
and score a few points, which this super-
speedster is more than capable of doing.

Junior Jarrett Lockhart (6-3, 195
pounds) may be the odd man out this
year. A starter last year because of
Tay1or’s injuries, Lockhart stepped up

THE Pin News

Panthers lose 2-0 to Red Flash

and became one of the top three-point
threats in the Big East, ﬁnishing third in
the league with a .394 shooting percent
from behind the arc in league games.
Now, he may be coming off the bench
behind Taylor to shoot the long ball. He
could still be a starter, though, because
of his off-season strength conditioning.
Lockhart looks much stronger than he
did last year, which should help this
already decent rebounding guard (4.4
rebounds per game) grab more rebounds
than some forwards in the -league.
Lockhart’s weak spot: His perimeter
defense was rather streaky in the past. If
Willard had Lockhart work on this area
of his game, he may be the most com-
plete fourth guard on any team in the
nation.

Pitt’s man without a position is
Stephen Flores (6-8, 210). Although he
has a forward’s body and is listed as a
forward in the media guide, Flores took
more three-point shots last year than
two pointers.

In addition, he had more assists and
more steals than blocks. Having a tall
guard who can shoot‘ three-pointers is a
great asset for any coach, but Flores
doesn’t possess the speed or perimeter
defense to be a true guard. Look for
Flores to see minutes as the No. 3 guard
(equivalent to a big guard/small for-
ward) in Willard’s three-guard set, often
taking 15-footers —- shots too close for
short guards to defend and too far out
for many forwards to move away from

The Panther men’s soccer team
lost a nonconference matchup
Wednesday afternoon to St. Francis
(Pa.). Pitt failed to score in the 2-0
loss, which dropped its record to 5-
8-3.

The teams played to a scoreless
first half, as Pitt lost sophomore
midfielder Tim Montgomery when
he was issued a red card for a foul.

Down a man, the Red Flash were

able to expose Pitt’s defense.

Troy Mohney, a senior striker
for St. Francis, found fellow senior
Dan Buysse open, and Buysse con-
verted.

That goal came at 57:05 of the
second half, but St. Francis wasn’t
finished. Junior Matthias Headland
from nearby Beaver Falls, Pa.,
scored 15 minutes later _at 71:32 to
increase the Red Flash lead to 2-0.

The score remained 2-0 as Pitt

the basket to stop. Flores is currently
nursing a broken right thumb, however,
and is expected to be out three to six
weeks.

A newcomer to the Pitt squad who
could end up starting a few contests is
junior point guard Jeremy Holmes (6-
0, 170 pounds). Holmes transferred to
Pitt in the off—season from a junior col-
lege in Kansas, and he brings incredible
speed and passing ability to the
Panthers. Holmes appears in practice to
have incredible conﬁdence dribbling
the ball through traffic, driving to the
basket, and finding open shooters. His
shot isn’t bad, either. Holmes will be
able to spell Cummings, or he can play
alongside the starting point guard to
give Pitt two great passers on the court
at one time.

As many three-point threats as Pitt
has (Cummings, Lockhart, Flores,
Taylor), the best may be freshman
Freddie Primus (6-3, 185). Primus
came out of high school last year as one
of the top long-distance shooters in the
country, having his accuracy described
by one analyst as “William Tell-like”
and his range as “intergalactic.” His
dribbling, passing and speed are OK for
a guard, but he won’t be called on to
lead the point: He’s here to shoot the
ball. His shot is quick and natural, so he
might be called on a few times this year
to take the final shot at the end of a
close game.

them to be,”
Cindy Alvear.

“Our highs are highs, and our lows
are lows, but overall, I’m pleased with
their performance.”

The Lady Panthers came out
strong in the first game, winning 15-6;
however, the team fell, 11-15, in the
second game, which ended with a
Duquesne ace that was left untouched.
The Panthers fought back in the third
game to win by a score of 15-6. Pitt
started the fourth game 5-0 and
increased its lead to 11-1. But the
Dukes refused to be put away that
quickly and came back with seven
straight points. Alpers ended the game
with a kill, making the score 15-10.

“Lately we’ve been doing really
well,” said Alpers. “We have a couple
of Big East games coming up, so we
have to step up our performance.”

As of now, the Lady Panthers are
ranked in the bottom half of the Big
East, but Alvear made it clear that the
team has already played most of the
schools at the top of that list. If the
Panthers get a few more Big East
wins, they may be able to end up in the
top half of the Big East.

“We are on the brink of a strong
team, and within a year, they are going
to be on top,” said Alvear. “Younger
women are pushing for the starting
positions, and they are doing an excel-
lent job handling the pressure.”

“I did some good things,” he said, “but
there are some things to improve on. I have
a good foundation here to start with. I got a
little bit of experience [today], and I think I
can take it from here.”

Needless to say, he didn’t take it from
there. Lytle was in and out of the Panther
lineup in 1996, then rode the bench behind
A.H.P. (After the Hispanic Panic) Pete
Gonzalez through the Liberty Bowl season
of 1997.

Now, as a senior, Lytle faces the possi-
bility of riding the bench again. Matt
O’Connor hasn’t been named the starter offi-
cially, but the junior-college transfer has seen
all the reps in practice, received a bucket of
praise from ooach Walt Harris, and probably
moved up the depth chart on most of the
area’s PlayStation college-football video
games.

Meanwhile, McNabb has moved into
serious contention for the Heisman Trophy
andcaptainsateamwithastmngchanceat
its second straight alliance bowl.

Lytle’s had a rough ride, and it seems
about to get rougher.

For four years, he’s’ been batted back
and forth as the Panthers changed coaches,
changed offenses and changed quarterbacks.

He played in some of Pitt’s most embar-
rassing losses, including a 72-0 demolition
by Ohio State and Notre Dame’s 60-6 victo-
ry over the Panthers ir1 South Bend two
years ago.

Oh, and he started in Pitt’s 55-7 loss
against Syracuse that season, too.

History dictates that when Matt Lytle
plays, Pitt gets beat It’s happened so much
inthepastthatPittfans——and,Ifear,Pitt
coaches — have associated Lytle’s play at
quarterback with the losses, ignoring other
options like an inexperienced offensive line
or an inexperienced running back corps.

Or, as was the case in 1996, a tenible
team in general.

Fact is, Lytle isn’t that bad. And while
some squads need a change of leadership to
pull them out of a tailspin, the young 1998
Panthers need Lytle to lead them. Maybe
he’l1 ﬁnd the spark he had four years ago.
Maybe he can step into the hero role that he
spoke about after the Syracuse game in
1995.

Maybe Lytle can live up to the potential
that only he saw in himself. He outshone
McNabb once in a losing effort; he could
just as easily outshine him in a winning one,
now that Brandon Williams has taken over
for DCIIICITIUS Harris and the West Coast
offense has supplanted Majors’ four-step
system of run, run, pass, punt that dominat-
ed much of 1995.

O’Connor doesn’t have that kind of tal-
ent He hasn’t been in the Harris system long
enough, and he doesn’t have the arm
strength or the mobility that Lytle brings to
an offense.

Hanis should give Lytle another
chance. After four years of suffering, let him
make good against the same team he battled
in his ﬁrst start. Stuﬂing it back in Heisman-
boy McNabb’s face wouldn’t be bad, either.
