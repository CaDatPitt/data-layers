Class employs marketing strategies tofeedthe hungry

Parthena Moisiadis
Stcyj’ W rite?‘

There was a ﬂash ﬁght in front
of the Cathedral on April 2. The
Canburglar stole Meal Man’s ladle.
But after chasing and lunging at
the thief in his blue bodysuit, gold
mask and yellow cape, Meal Man

won the ﬁght and reunited with

his once—1ost ladle.
The performance was one

of many efforts put forth by the ’
" students in Robert Gilbert’s Proj-

ects in Marketing class to spread
awareness for their campaign,
One Meal at a Time. -One Meal
at a Time implores Generation Y
members toihelp end hungerlin
the ‘Pittsburgh area by donating
money and food to the Greater
Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.

Thursday morning in Mervis
Hall, the students in the class

'delivered a presentation, which

outlined the results of their semes-
ter-long campaign, to members of
the food bank. After Pitt matched

the total amount of donations, ‘

the campaign raised more than
$8,000 for the food bank and an
additional 2,300 pounds in food

donations. »

The students outlined their ob-
jectives, campaign theme, events,
advertising, public relations and
research that contributed to the
ﬁnal project. ' °

Gilbert said it’s important to,_

keep in mind that although the
project served as a feel-good
proposition, it was also a business
proposition.

Senior marketing -major Amy
Peduto said the theme for the cam-
paign’ emerged as a simple idea,
but developed into something
larger.

“We came to realize that hun-
ger was an issue that is much clos-
er to us than we realized,” she said.

Zoe Alexander, who worked
with Peduto on the campaign’s
theme, said it included six key
events. .

I‘

In the first event, Hunger

‘Squad Bag Drop, the students dis-

tributed more than 400 reusable
bags to South Oakland residents
and to on—campus residence halls.
The residents ﬁlled the bags with

' nonpersishable food items for the

students to then pick up.
‘Alexander said this event tru-

ly highlighted the signiﬁcance
of their project, particularly for
those who received the food do-
nations. '

Following the bag drop, the
students received a letter from a
thankful recipient of the food.

“The letter brought our class
closer together. It gave us a chance
to remind ourselves how we made
a difference,” Alexander said.

Other events included a Hun-
ger Squad Iron Chef Competition,

’ in which Pitt students assembled
‘into teams to create delectable

dishes out of nonperishable foods
often found in food banks, such as

‘ ramen noodles.

The students hosted other
events on campus, offering food
to students to raise awareness of
their campaign. ’ .

They even ventured off campus
to collect donations -from attend-
ees at both Penguins and Pirates
games. '

Senior Tessa Bohman said the
group .ﬂyered and tabled around
campus to promote its project.
In addition to these traditional
advertising techniques, the group
also employed less—traditional

means to attract attention.
Kevin Ray, who focused on ad-

vertising for the campaign, said

that Meal Man, the superhero the

group devised to serve as a mascot g

for One Meal at a Time, was one
of the central components to their
advertising. .

“Meal Man is more than just
a superhero — he’s a source of
inspiration. Anyone can ﬁght hun-
ger, and anyone can be Meal Man,”
he said. I

While many students became
familiar with Meal Mangfrom see-
ing him around campus,*others
learned of him from YouTube vid-
eos the students created.

One of the videos features Meal

- Man in a ‘Harlem Shake video

alongside a gorilla and a wizard. ‘

Ray explained that the videos
served as a lighthearted way to
approach the issue.

The last nontraditional means
of advertising the group employed
was meant to break stereotypes
about people who use the food
bank. ' A

Some of Gilbert’s students
dressed as businessmen and doc-
tors while holding signs, high-

lighting the fact that not only the

homeless and unemployed go‘

hungry.
The class successfully in-

creased awareness in their target
group, Generation Y, by a dramatic
425 percent, according to surveys
conducted by One Meal at a Time.

Emily,Costantinou, who fo-
cused on the research aspects of
the campaign, explainedthat the
surveys showed that only 3 percent
of those who the group surveyed
identiﬁed hunger as a social is-
sue beforé theqcampaign; ,y‘¢t_'th,is
percentage rose to ~1"6'pércent after
the campaign. '

Other results included im-
provements in perceptions of
food bank recipientsand general
awareness regarding the food
bank. ‘

Ray said the results of the cam-
paign taught him a lot about the
Pitt community.

“People are deﬁnitely willing
to help —- they just don’t see it.
We were just trying to get people
to start thinking about it, to put it
in their minds. If they saw it more
often, they’d be more.willing to
act,” he said. I

my MY own woms

Cider: A respectable alternative to beer

Naomi Borrebach .
- Opz'nions Editor

While beer is the default al-
coholicbeveragéof most college
students, a surprising number
of people say they hate it —— the
malty, grainy ﬂavor and carbon-
ation can add up toibe a really un-
pleasant sensation for some‘, and
most kinds of beer are intolerable
for people who can’t digest glu-
ten. But most people who eschew
beer probably still see the need
for a moderately—alcoholic, light
beverage — something less in-

tense than mixed drinks or shots,

not as fussy or sophisticated as A

wine, yet more grown—up and less
cloyingly sweet than hard lemon-
ade or wine coolers.

My foray into the world of
hard cider started on the Internet.
Cider was the drink of choice of
English settlers in North America:
Early settlers, upon discovering
only inedible native crabapples
in New England, requested apple
seeds from England and started
orchards. Apples were easier to
grow than the barley and grains
required to make beer, and ci-
der soon became a staple of the
American diet. Missionary John
Chapman (better known as John-
ny Appleseed) planted orchards
of cider apples in the West.

Immigrants’ from Germany '

and Eastern Europe eventually
made beer more popular than
cider in the United States, but it
was outlawedin the 1920s dur-
ing the-Prohibition Era. After
Prohibition was repealed, cider
still lagged behind beer, in part
because it took years to regrow
ci_der orchards after years of no

demand.

According to an article from
NPR, hard cider became more
popular in the 1980s with the rise
of microbreweries and interest in
small—batch brewing. Cider has

. become much In re popular in

recent years, withfsales rising 65
percent between.2’o11 and 2012.

Once I'had gotten my cider
history down, it was time to start
sampling. *1 purchased varieties

der brands °— Woodchuck Am-

ber, Strongbow and Angry Or-
chard Crisp Apple. The amount
of alcohol in a bottle of cider is

-equivalent to that of many beers

—— every cider I tried contained 5
percent alcohol by volume —— and
they are all carbonated. h

At first I expected all of the
ciders to taste like variations
of mildly-alcoholic, ﬁzzy apple
juice, but there were many vari-
ations in ﬂavor. Craft brewers

use different types of apples and
brewing techniques to make their
ciders dry, sweet or in between;
some taste very fruity while oth-
ers have a more subtle ﬂavor.
The first cider I tried was
Strongbow. One of my friends
commented that it was “manly,”
and I’d have to agree:'It seems
like it’s packaged and marketed
to appear more masculine than
the other varieties. It surprisingly

' tasted more like beer than the

sweet apple cider I buy every fall.
It’s drier and only tastes subtly
of apple,’

Up next was my favorite of
the lot: ‘the Woodchuck Amber.
This popular variety of cider is
much sweeter than the Strongbow
without being overkill, smelled
much more fruity and had the
right balance of apple ﬂavors.
The only downside was that, to
me, the Woodchuck felt a lot more
carbonated than the other brands
I tried.

When we smelled the Angry
Orchard Crisp Apple, my friend
and I both noticed a strangely

_ artiﬁcialapple scent, which was

reminiscent of green apple Jolly
Ranchers. The label said that
there are “natural flavors” in the
cider, and I suspect that those ﬂa-
vorings might have been the cause
of the strangely unnatural smell.
On a positive note, the cider was
quite sweet and refreshing — but
it tasted too much like candy for
my tastes.

- Cider’s increasing popularity
means that there are a lot of va-
rieties available. Just like beer,
there’s a cider for everyone, so
‘get, sampling to ﬁnd your favorite
kind. I

FOOTBALL

Blanc named Head Athletic Tranerof the Year

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

It looks unlikely that any of the .

Pitt sports teams will win a na-
tional championship this season,
but one unheralded Panther re-
ceived a No. 1 ranking Wednesday
evening. _

Rob Blanc, who has_ served as
the Pitt head football trainer and
clinical instructor for the past 25
years, was recognized as the 2013
NCAA Division I Head ‘Athletic
Trainer of the Year by the National
Athletic Trainers Association.

Blanc will be honored at the‘
2013 NATA Convention in Las Ve-
gas in June. V

“Rob is a tremendous asset for
our entire athletic department,”
Pitt Athletic Director Steve Peder-
s_on said in a statement. “Having
known him for nearly 17 years,
the greatest complimentl can give
Rob is that it’s obvious to every-
one that his ﬁrst and only priority
is the well-being of our student-
athletes. His knowledge and com-
mitment to the athletic training
profession is exceptional.”

Blanc, a Pittsburgh native, at-
tended Slippery Rock University
as an undergraduate, Ohio Uni-
versity for graduate school and
previously worked for New Lex-

ington High School in Ohio, the
Pittsburgh Steelers and Duquesne

‘ University before joining Pitt.

He also "co-authored a textbook,
“Emergency Care in Athletic
Training.” “

“It has been a privilege and a

Rah Blane joined the Pitt training staff 25 years ago. Courtesy Pitt Athletics

pleasure to work side by side with
Rob Blanc for 25 years,” Freddie
Fu, chairman of the Department
of Orthopaedic Surgery at Pitt and

UPMC, said in a statement. “He '

is a consummate professional,
athletic trainer and educator.

It’s difficult for me to imagine
that there are many more head
athletic trainers who care more
about, and care more for, their
players and coaches, their team,
their athletic department and
their university.” I

BASEBALL

  Panthers battle Rutgers in key Big East series

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The.Pitt baseball team faces one of
its biggest series of the season this
weekend. -
_ After sweeping St.]ohn’s, getting
swept by South Florida and then
sweeping Notre Dame inits ﬁrst three
Big East weekend series, Pitt (26-10,
6-3 Big East) hosts the Rutgers Scar-
let Knights (18-16, 8-4 Big East) fora
set of three gamesthis weekend on
Friday at 6 p:m., Saturday at 3 p.m.
and Sunday at noon at Charles L. Cost
Field in the Petersen Sports Complex.

Depending on the outcome of the
three games, the Panthers could ei-
ther propel themselves to the top of
the Big East standings or drop further
behind the conference leaders.

Pitt had its six-game winning

*_ streak snapped Wednesday after-

noon aﬁer losing to Coppin State

6-3 in nonconference play, and head
coach Joe Jordano hopes his team’s
sloppy play in its midweek games
doesn’t carry over into the crucial
weekend matchup with Rutgers.
“That was a stunning loss for us
this aitemoon,”]ordano said after
the game. “I give Coppin State an
incredible amount of credit, as they
played hard, had timely hitting and
made big pitches. I was not pleased

‘ ‘with. the way that we played Tues-

day, and quite frankly, it carried into
today. But again, all credit goes to
Coppin State. They deserved the win
and outplayed us in that ball game.”

The Scarlet Knights enter Pitts-
burgh playing good baseball, winning
four of their last ﬁve games. Rutgers
also remains as the only team in the
conference to have beaten-Big Eastfa-
vorite Louisville twice back in March.

And like the Panthers, Rutgers
boasts apowerful offense that hopes

to unsettle Pitt’s starting pitching
staff, which has excelled in recent
weeks. .
Despite the loss to Coppin State
and the surprisingly close victory
over Youngstown State this week, the
Panthers hope to emulate the style
of baseball they played last weekend
against Notre Dame. Starters Ethan
Mildren, Matt‘ Wotherspoon and
Rhys Aldenhoven, who all pitched
at least seven innings in the dominat-
ing victories over the Fighting Irish
at home, will once again be the key
players for Pitt.

On offense, star outﬁelder Casey .

Roche anchors the Pitt batting lineup
with his impressive .362 batting av-
erage, nine home runs and 50 runs
batted in. But he attributes his im-
pressive statistics to his teammates
and coaches.

“Guys have been getting on base
in front of me,” Roche said. “I stick

to the approach that the coaches give
us, and it’s been working out.” ‘

It certainly worked out last week-
end, with senior shortstop Evan
Oswald saying that the Panthers
excelled in every facet of the game
against Notre Dame.

“We played excellent defense. We
hit the ball very well. Pitching was
outstanding,” he said. “All around,

- it was just a great weekend.”

Jordano agreed, calling last week-
end’s performance the best his team
has played since its sweep at Wichita
State at the beginning of the season.
Still, he knows that last weekend’s
three wins mean nothing if the Pan-
thers don’t pick up another home
series win against a solid Rutgers
squad.

“We will certainly see what we’re
made of this weekend,” he said. “It
will be a great challenge against a
very tough Rutgers team.” I

 

SOFTBALL--f
Pitt hosts
Notre Dame

RJ Sepich J
Sports Editor

Losing a-game 15-0 is never easy, but
the Pitt softball team must quickly
move on from its shellacking at the
hands of No. 8 Louisville when the
Panthers welcome Notre Dame (30-
10, 10-1 Big East) to Vartabedian Field
in the Petersen Sports Complex for
a three-game series this weekend.

In dominating fashion, the Car-
dinals swept a doubleheader from
head coach Holly Aprile’s Panthers
on Wednesday afternoon, and now
Pitt (16-24, 5-9 BigEast) faces another
one of the Big East’s best teams.

The Panthers want to avoid a
repeat of last season’s meeting with
the Fighting Irish, which resulted in
Notre Dame sweeping Pitt and hold-
ing the Panthers to just one run over
three games.

Sophomore starting pitchers Sa-
vannah King and Alexa Larkin need
to improve after allowing too many
runs in many of the team’s conference
games this season. They face one of
the season’s toughest challenges this
weekend, with six Notre Dame hitters
batting at least .300 this season.

But the Pitt offense, which sput-
tered in the blowout against Louis-
ville, has shown improvement re-
cently, scoring 16 runs in the team’s
three games before the 15-0 defeat.
But facing Notre Dame star pitcher
Laura Winter, a junior who boasts an
impressive 19-8 record with a 1.89
earned-run average, will be no easy
task.

Lead-off hitter Tori Nirschl leads
the Pitt attack with a .331 batting av-
erage, and the freshman outﬁelder
needs to get on base a lotthis weekend
if the Panthers hope to surprise the
Fightinglrish. Nirschl earnedWeekly
Honor Roll recognition from the Big
East conference last week after an im-
pressive performance at Seton Hall.

Notre Dame enters the series as
a heavy favorite after an easy sweep
over Rutgers in Big East action last
weekend. History also favors the
visiting Irish, who hold a six-game
winning streak over the Panthers and
haven’t lost against Pitt since 2009.

The teams play adoubleheader
at Vartabedian Field on Saturday be-
ginning at noon before ﬁnishing the
series with a matchup Sunday, also
at noon. I

‘ I  ti"  McAteer
News Editor

For Mel Shears, a longtime
Oakland resident and a self-de-
scribed regular at Unclejimmy’s
Tavern on Semple Street in Oak-

land, time spent at the bar is akin

to a family reunion because of
the atmosphere bar owner Mike
Beatty promotes.

“I love him like a son,” Shears
said.

While Shears and many of the
bar’s other regulars admit that
Uncle ]immy’s is a “Pittsburgh
bar, not a Pitt bar,” meaning that
it doesn’t fit the traditional mold
of a college pub, some Pitt stu-
dents still choose to spend their
evenings there to escape from
the wild atmosphere that’s prev-
alent in other Oakland drinking
establishments.

Katelin Webster, a nursing
major, arrived at Uncle _]immy’s
on a Saturday night wearing a
green shirt that matched those
of her sorority sisters. The girls
flocked to pool tables and began
begging other patrons in the bar
to take their picture, creating
more noise than the remainder
of the bar’s crowd combined.

Though this night was an ob-
vious exception, Webster said
she typically goes to Uncle jim-
my’s when she needs an escape
from the often-raucous college
nightlife.

“There [are] plenty of Pitt
bars. I like something a little
different,” she said.

Patrons of Uncle Jimmy's Tavern on Semple Street in South Oakland gather for a drink. Bobby Mizia |
Assistant Visual Editor -

But Webster isn’t the only Pitt
student who occasionally stops
by Uncle jimmy’s for a drink. In
fact, Will Satterwhite, who works
as a bouncer at the bar, said
about 30 Pitt students consider
themselves regulars and often
stop by late at night for drinks
around closing time.

And though the bar’s drink
specials are enticing‘, Satterwhite
says it’s the crowd that brings
people back.

“They come in here for a beer,
and they stay for the personali-
ties that hang out here,” he said.
“And most of them tend to like
it.”

Uncle _]immy’s hours of op-

eration also set it apart. Mon-
day through Friday the bar is
open from 11 a.m. until 2 a.m.
— earlier than any other bar in
the area. It has two pool tables,
three video slot machines, two
ﬂat screen televisions and a juke-
box that regularly plays a variety
of music, from Bob Dylan to Lil
Wayne. It’s generally uncrowded,
and there are a number of tables
available for groups who plan to
visit the bar.

This laid—back atmosphere is
exactly how Beatty likes it.

While he admitted that he’d
like to attract more college stu-
dents to the bar, he vows that
he’ll uphold the laid—back at-

mosphere that his grandfather,
James “Uncle Jimmy” Connors,
promoted when he owned the

“I don’t want the club atmo-
sphere. [Connors] never wanted

the club atmosphere here. He .

wanted an all-around diverse
crowd here —— a real melting
pot,” Beatty said. ‘

According to Beatty, Connors

was a lifelong Oakland resident
who grew up on Parkview Avenue
in South Oakland. He opened the
bar in 1993, and Beatty took over
the family business after Con-
nors’ death from lung cancer in
2008- _.

But Beatty was already a vet-

  sphere transcends generation

eran in the bar business by then.
He began washing glasses at Un-
cle jimmy’s when he was only
4 years old. On June 23, 2008,
he became the officialowner of
UncleJimmy’s. His grandmother,
Sue Connors, helped out around
the bar before her death last year.

These days, his goal is main-
taining and improving the foun-
dation set by Connors.

“It still feels like he’s here
because I try to keep it as close

. or the same while adding new

ideas,” Beatty said.

Running a bar isn’t always as
entertaining as it might seem, ac-
cording to Beatty. Because of his
grandfatheifs legacy, the regu-
lars have certain expectations.
Beatty often finds it difficult to

remain silent when facing a con-

stant barrage of recommenda-
tions for the bar’s improvement.

Customers even overreactl
if he forgets to perform a daily
task, which can be frustrating
because of the large number of
responsibilities he has on any
given day.

But, in sticking to what Con-
nors taught him, Beatty said he
knows it’s impossible to please

Beer apps present options for frequent bargoers

Matthew Schreiber
_ Social Media Editor

««.It’s no secret that most college students

readily purchase the beer staples —— Natu-
ral Light, Miller or, if they’re particularly
fancy, Yuengling. But how many friends do
you have that always seem to have the best
craft beers in their refrigerators — beers

that you’ve never heard of before?

The key to purchasing craft beers
that taste far better than the more bor-
ing choices currently sits comfortably in
your pocket. Smartphones are the best
and easiest way to tap into the world of
excellent beers.

Armed with any of the following five
apps for iOS and Android devices, you can
choose the best possible beers and become
the hero among your group of friends: the
person that always buys the best beer.

RateBeer (Android — free)

While shopping for beer, quicklyﬁre
up this app to read reviews from other
users who rank hundreds of thousands
of different beers from around the world
on a scale from zero to 100. You can use
its included barcode scanner to draw up
quick facts about the offerings. And if you
already have a specific beer in mind, you
can use the app to search for it from the
comfort of your ovifn home and find_,where
it’s sold nearby.

Beer Buddy (iOS — $0.99)

Remarkably similar to RateBeer (except
for its iOS-only compatibility), Beer Buddy
allows its users to rank beers on the basis
of aroma, appearance, taste and palate
to giveeach beverage a score out of ﬁve
stars. It also includes a barcode scanner
to quickly draw up reviews of beers. You

, can use the app to identify your favorite

beers, and it will notify you when you’re
close to a distributor that sells them — a
particularly useful feature if what you like
is hard to ﬁnd.

Untappd (iOS and Android — free)
A location—based social network for

beer lovers, Untappd crowdsources beer .

reviews — similar to Yelp — and orga-
nizes them based on local bars. For ex-
ample, you could walk into Hemis, turn
on Untappd, and see what beers other

users have ordered and found particu- .

larly enjoyable there. Untappd also posts
current beer menus for nearby bars and
restaurants based upon your current lo-
cation. It has a pretty active community
that can sometimes make it challenging to
search through the comments and ratings
to find useful tips.

BrewGene (iOS and Android — free)

The perfect app for getting away from
those overused college staples, BrewGene
allows you to input a beer that you like
and will suggest similar ones based on
predetermined algorithms. The app col-
lects reviews from its users to create a
real—time list of the top 100 beers —— a
particularly interesting feature.

Beercloud (iPhone and Android —
free)

If you’re really looking to take your
beer—choosing abilities to the next level
and potentially impress a few people in

the process, BeerCloud is a nifty app. It
suggests beers to pair with whatever food _

you’re enjoying. And it gets specific. Do
you know that anchovies pair well with
German-style pilsners? BeerCloud does.

Ethiopian beers provide gateway into exotic new world of ﬂavor

Gideon Bradshaw
Stay?” Wrz'ler

About 15 miles from Addis Ababa,
the capital of Ethiopia, a brewery
sits next to a soft mineral spring.
The water from the spring meets
international brewing standards,

as it requires no additional treat- ’

ment. The locals call it “holy wa-
ter.”

The brewery also maintains a
public park on its grounds where
people can gather to enjoy nature
along with Meta, which the brew-
ery produces and which Kebede
Tadesse, a businessman who
distributes Ethiopian beer in the
U.S., called “the king of beers in
Ethiopia.”

Meta and other Ethiopian
beers offer a possible alternative
to common American beer for
many reasons that could make
them attractive to American con-
sumers. But for the time being,
enthusiasts will have to work to
ﬁnd them, as several factors cur-
rently limit availability in the U.S.

And among those who already
appreciate them, loyalty is ﬁerce.

“I have people driving hun-
dreds of miles just to get a sip of
this beer,” said Tadesse, CEO of
the Hanover, Md., Shipping Ser-
vices LLC, which transports Ethio-

rapher.

pian beer all over the U.S.

Tana, an Ethiopian restaurant
on Baum Boulevard in East Liber-
ty, which to Tadesse’s knowledge
is Pittsburgh’s onlycestablishment
serving Ethiopian beer, described
those who appreciate these brands
in similar terms.

Seifu Haileyesus, the owner

Several varieties of Ethiopian beer are available at local Pittsburgh eateries. Nishant Singh l Staff Photog-

of Tana, said that one of his cus-
tomers regularly travels from the
North Hills to get the Bedele, a
highly rated Ethiopian pale lager.

Tadesse attributed this small,
but loyal, following to the distinc-
tive ﬂavors present in some Ethio-
pian beers.

Tadesse said the current mar-

ket for the Ethiopian beers he

distributes is ethnically based.‘

The beers are available primarily
in" Ethiopian restaurants such as
Tana, and Tadesse acknowledged
that most American beer drinkers
don’t seek out the beers he ships.

“Our next chapter, our next
focus, our next goal, is to move

- into the mainstream market,” he

said about his company. A

But without manufacturers’ as-
sistance in promoting the beer,
Tadesse doesn’t think this will
happen anytime soon.

Tadesse said the companies
that produce Ethiopian beer
have not shown much interest in
increasing their exports, choos-
ing instead to meet the growing
domestic demands for their beer,

While it might make sense to
sell the beer in the U.S., where
consumers will pay more than in
Ethiopia, Tadesse said that the
price advantage is not as great as
it could be. This is partly because
there is no production plant for
beer bottles in Ethiopia. Ethio-
pian producers are able to reuse
the bottles for beer that they sell
in Ethiopia and must replace the
bottles they export by importing
new bottles from China.

Joseph Tucker, the executive
director of RateBeer.com, a web-
site that ranks beers and serves as
a resource for beer enthusiasts,
pointed out that most Ethiopian
beers — with the exception of
Hakim Stout — are pale lagers,
a style well—suited for hot sum-
mer days.

POINT/COUNTERPOINT

Which beer is better: a democratic drink or acraft brew?

Nick Stamatakis
For The Pitt News

These are tough times for the traditional
American pale lager.

The American consumer is increas-
ingly forgoing pleasures of Bud Llght,
Miller Light and Coors Light, in favor of
more exotic brews. Since the end of the
last recession, ales, porters and wheat
beers are driving a slowly recovering beer
industry. Two columnists debate what
this means for our society.

It’s great that beer is bouncing back.
After briefly falling behind wine in Gal-
lup’s annual poll on America’s drinking
habits (what are we, France?), beer is
again the drink of choice as of 2012 — the
favorite of 39 percent of alcohol consum-
ers (compared to 35 percent for wine and
22 percent for liquor).

But the price of this bounce back -
the shift toward a more diverse beer land-
scape —— bothers me in some respects.
Yes, variety is good for the consumer. Yes,
standard pale lager can get repetitive. But
our uniform landscape did serve a useful
purpose. Perhaps this is just paranoid,

Burkean conservatism. But I think this
new marketplace is not a sign of higher
standards, but a sign of a quickly unravel-
ing American social fabric.

The great, national beer brands were
just one more way consumer culture once
united class differences within this coun-
try.

Like Heinz ketchup or Kellogg’s cereal,
Budweiser and Coors were purchased_by
rich and poor alike. While there are, and
have always been, luxury brands, the vast
majority of American refrigerators at
least had beer in common.

Craft beers, however, are more like
wine; they are undemocratic vessels of
elitism and class differentiation. Just as
few w‘o’rking—class people have a 1982
Chateau Latour in their cellars, few have
an IPA from that small brewer in Vermont
you just had to stop at after your weekend
in Stowe.

Beer is becoming just another re-
minder of class differentiation. It is a
status symbol, a sign of sophistication
and wealth. It is no longer reminding us

Beer is an integral part of the American
college experience. Surely we are not all
John Belushis — and not every South-Oak-
land home is an Animal House — but even
for the most sober among us, beer plays
some role in our identity as American
college students. We will all remember
the images of Natty cans scattered across
Semple Street on—a Saturday morning or
the late-night glow of The O. ’
Increasingly, American—owned micro-
breweries produce the beer we consume.
And that’s a good thing for our economy,
our regional identity and our taste buds.
The 20oo—plus craft brews across
America exemplify the impressive health
of a growing industry. While the econo-
my still struggles with unemployment,
103,585 Americans have ‘found jobs in
the microbrew industry. And last year,
the inaugural Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week
brought in more than $3 million to our
city’s economy. This April, the craft beer
alliance that hosts the 10-day event ex-
pects to bring‘ even more economic activ-

ity to the area.

But these intrepid brewers of the Gin-
gerbread Stout or the Sexual Chocolate
do more than provide a stimulus to the
Americaneconomy. With their unusual
ﬂavors, often incorporating some aspect

-of the regional culture, microbrews create

a source of identity in a globalized world
that smears the regional divisions, which
once made us unique.

The product of a microbrew in Ashe-
ville, N.C., for example, is considered
distinctive because of the local pristine
waters with which the beer is brewed. The
T-Rail Pale Ale brewed in Danville, Pa., is
a source of pride for a town that claims to
have produced the first T-shaped railroad
ties that revolutionized railway travel
in the 19th-century U.S. Subtle ﬂavors

' and clever titles such as these reﬂect the

distinct traits and cultures of the regions
from which they flow.

Indeed, the diverse microbrews from
Worcester, Mass., to Portland, Ore., be-
come our nation’s steadfast mom-and-
pop stores, boldly defying a world that

Gay bars create presence in Pittsburgh with varying themes

Matt Singer
Staﬁ Wrz'ter

Between the outside aesthetics of neon‘ 

and boisterous pop music, it’s sometimeshard
to differentiate between bars based on their
appearance. But jumping to conclusions about
what’s inside may seriously discredit the'signiﬁ—
cance that some bars play in the social lives of
some Pittsburghers. ~ .  ‘
On one evening, Harris Grill, a pdpular~Sha—
dyside bar,.was playing loud music as people

drank, laughed and ate on the venue’s porch.

Less than a block away, others were doing the
same at 5801 Video Lounge and Cafe, a well-
known gay bar. ' .

5801 advertises itselfas a gay establishment

that welcomes pretty much anyone and every— -

one. Although 5801 is a very popular gay bar
and many Pitt students are familiar with it, it
is only one of the city’s many gay bars. A _
Though Pittsburgh doesn’t have quite as
many or quite as varied gay bars as larger cit-
ies such as Philadelphia, they are still seen by
gay Pittsburghers as an important part of th
city’s culture. ’ - T . '
“I think that gay bars in Pittsburgh serve
their purpose well as  well, gay bars in Pitts-
bur ,” said Carter Talerico, a 31-year-old Pitts-

burgh native, patron of 5801 and member of A

the gay community. “They facilitate a sense of
community.” _ .

Unfortimately, not all public places outside
of this community are as accepting, as some
restaurants and bars have patrons that take
contention with LGBTQ individuals.

“As progressiveas Pittsburgh is, it’s still
backwards in a lot of ways,” Talerico said.

Despite many public venues being open to

' individuals ofanysexualorientation,thatdoes g
notnegatethefactthatdiscriminationdoesstill

exist and can manifest itself in ways that make
members of the LGBTQ community uncomfort-
able. To this end, the role that gay bars play are
doubly important, servingas both hotspots for
socialization and places that fosteranenviron—
ment in which people feel thattheycanbe open
and act as themselves._ , N n‘

“A lot of gay people feel like they’ can’t be
themselves or show any sort of PDA in a lot
of bars and other public p_laces,”~ said Tricia
Dougherty, a Pitt senior and president of Pitt’s
Rainbow Alliance.

PDA, or public displays of affection, can
range from holding hands to kissing.

“You have to be smart and practical about
those sorts ‘of things,” said Dustin Ferrero, a
32-year-old Pittsburgh native and member of

. the gay community, referring to LGBTQ PDA.

“It’s not okay everywhere. It would be nice if
it was, but you have to use your brain,” he said.

Andrew Henderson, who has been the man-
ager of Lawrenceville’s Blue Moon- bar since
2002, describes his bar as a “Gay Cheers,” say-
ingthat it’s aplace that many people just see as
their friendly neighborhood bar.

“People ﬁrst come because it’s a gay bar,”
said Henderson, “but the friendly and safe at-

mosphere keeps them coming back and bring-

ing friends  them.” I

Gluten—free diet nodonger   
‘ burden for beer drinkers  

Em Maier
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

When people think of allergies, they often

. think of chocolate, grass,‘ animal dander and

sometimes milk. A . .
But at least they can still enjoy a nice, cold

beer at the end of day. A

This isn’t so for people with celiac disease,
a health problem that requires the lifestyle
known as “gluten—free.” The disease dam-

ages the small intestine, as well as creating ‘

difﬁculty in absorbing nutrients. Gluten — a

— protein found in wheat, rye and barley -

generates an abnormal immune response.
The body will attack tiny little bumps lining
the small intestine, called villi, which usually

- absorb the nutrients. If left untreated, people

become signiﬁcantly malnourished, even with
a bountiful feast spread before them.

At its essence, beer is comprised of four
core ingredients: water, hops, yeast and
barley. Yet for individuals with celiac, that
last ingredient can cause them to experience
stomach spasms, fatigue,_depression or even

lead to infertility.

Brewers have realized this untapped mar-

ket and taken up the challenge of perfecting _

new varieties of beer, using various grains or
grasses such as rice or buckwheat. In 2007, the
GreatAmerican Beer Festival oflicially added
a gluten-free category. Last year, 20 entrants
competed, with Rock Bottom Arlington and
Strange Brewing Company tyingfor ﬁrst place.

Gluten-free beer is generally made using

one of two methods. The first — a complete.

avoidance of gluten grains —— often creates a
different ﬂavor from regularbeers, as com-
panies experiment with fruit or sorghum to
generate new ﬂavors for the beer.

The other way isto create beer normally
and then extract the gluten. While those with

particularly sensitive cases of celiac typically‘

avoid this type, international standards have
deemed it acceptable. Unfortunately, an indi-
vidual will only know which type a beer is if
the brewery publishes its results. V

Until recently, alcohol innovators had been
frustrated by legal problems surrounding
gluten-free beer. Gluten—free beers didn’t ﬁt
under the Federal Alcohol Administration
Act of 1935’s deﬁnition of beer as a beverage
brewed from malted barley and other grains.

The FAA Act required the Alcohol and
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau “to ensure
that a product’s label adequately inform[ed]
consumers about the nature of the product
and that the label information ‘[was] truth-
ful, accurate and not misleading.” Problems
arose when the Food and Drug Administration
noted that there was no scientiﬁc method
to substantiate‘ gluten-free foods. On July 7,

. 200_8, the 'I'I‘B decided to let the FDA maintain

regulation ofwhether a given beer is in fact
gluten-free.
An “interim” ruling was_announced in

May 2012, stating that the TTB will “not allow '

products made from ingredients that contain
gluten to be labeled as ‘gluten—free.”’ So even
for those brewers who use the method of ex-
tractingthe gluten from their beer, any beer
made with barley or rye couldn’t have a gluten-
free label, even if the content was below the
World Health Organization’s recommended
20 parts permillion. The TTB’s ruling mainly

A , resulted-from a lack of a deﬁnition regarding
_ gluten-free beers. _
Breweries persist, even with the confusion A ‘

from the TTB and FDA. One new company,
the.Aurochs Brewing Company, exists outside
downtown Pittsburgh. Ryan Bove, a recently
diagnosed celiac‘, teamed up with childhood
friend Doug Foster, who’d been diagnosed with
the disease at age 6, to start the companyin

2012 . Four other men joined the team to help _

with ﬁnances and the crafting of the taste.
“I had been helping Ryan go gluten-free,
and one day we were commiserating over the

lack of variety in gluten-free beer. It was tough ~

for Ryan because he had loved and lost. He
had enjoyed awide variety of great craft beers
before his diagnosis. I had always been limited

A and wanted to ﬁnd out what all the craft beer

buzz was about,” Foster said.

- The group follows the ‘theory of starting
with no gluten materials. They had made
the decision before the 'ITB and FDA ruling,
Foster said. ‘

“‘Gluten-removed’ or ‘gluten-reduced’
beers might be_safe for someone who chooses
to eat gluten-free, but there may be a riskfor
those with celiac disease (an autoimmune dis-

— order) or a severe gluten intolerance,”’he said.

As Foster and Bove soon realized, gluten-
free beer was not the most palatable. Others
shared their opinion.

“Most of the gluten-free beer I’d had before
was pretty awﬁil,” said Rebecca Lebens, a Pitt
junior who is gluten-intolerant. ‘ '

Aurochs’ brewers agreed, noting their con-
tinued learning and troubleshooting. .

“Some of the biggest issues with brew-
ing gluten—free beer involve sourcing quality
gluten-free ingredients, extracting enough
sugar from our malted grains and managing
a longer brew process.” ' '

While Aurpchs is working hard, it’s not

necessarily getting to the public.

' “Although gluten-free food is getting sig-
niﬁcantly better and more common, some
bartenders don’t know of any good beers, or
even have them,” Lebens said.

Allison Patton, a local Pittsburgher, was

A hopeful about new breweries moving in.

“Having a nearby brewery could- get other
bars to start picking up gluten-free products,
making it easier to ﬁnd drinks,” Patton said.

», Aurochs, which is “anxiously anticipat-~ ~

ing a launch. in the coming months,” will ini-
tially sell just growlers _— take-out jugs of
beer straight from the tap. The owners are
hopeful that their product will soon spread
to bars and restaurants. I -

POINT OF,CLA|RE-ITY

Upgrade your alcohol selection, upgrade your lifestyle

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

I declared the rash statement after my ﬁrst few
sips of beer that I hated it. Not just the beer I
was drinking, but all beers, because I was sure
that each of them would taste equally strange. I
decided that I hated liquor when I ﬁrst smelled
it at parties. How wouldl ever like vodkawhen
it smells like nail polish remover? These gener-
alizations most likely occurred because I was
dealing with the stuff of the absolute worst
quality possible.

Of course, as college students, we can’t re-

' ally afford to buytop—shelfalcohol.Whenaliter

of Vladimir Vodka costs less than $8 and just
375 milliliters of Belvedere costs an estimated
$17, you begin to question your priorities and

do some math to ﬁnd out just how much each

drink is worth. I .
It’s time to abandon the plasticrbottles of

"liquor and move up to something just a bit

classier. Sure, when you’re having a sizable
party, you have no interest in spending huge
sums of money, especially if you’re making
a vat of jungle juice for 50 of your “closest”
Facebook friends and whomever they choose

V to bring. But when you and your real friends

are the ones consuming the alcohol, consider
going up ashelf. _
A bottle of Absolut costs $13. Of course,

’ you’re getting less in terms of quantity than you

would with the dreaded “Vlad,” but have you

ever heard of someone who enjoys drinking ,

Vlad? I certainly have not. Absolut is a much
smoother vodka without Vlad’s horrifying
smell, which reminds you of something out
of a chemistry lab. A more enjoyable experi-
ence is worth the extra money. ‘
Chances are that everyone’s ﬁrst beer was
a cheap one. Perhaps it was from a frat party
and had a stale carbonated taste. Perhaps it
was justa bunch of foam from a keg someone
had pumped afew too many times.«~If_ this is the
beer you’re using as a base for your judgment
of the beverage as a whole, think again.
i I understand that many people do not like
the hoppy taste of some beers. Thepkey word
here is “some.” There are plenty ofbeer options
for those who are not particularly keen on the

’ unusual and otherwise unfamiliar taste of hops.

' There is always the light version, which
seems to go down easier, but those might be-
come boring pretty quickly. For those who
want to drink something sweet and minimally
alcoholic tasting, there is a plethora of variet-

ies that have a mostly fruit-based ﬂavor. An

example of this is the Leinenkugel Berry Weiss,
which is ﬂavored enough to have a reddish-
pink color to it. Leinenkugel also offers its
Summer Shandy, with ataste akin to lemonade
and ahint of beer. _ . .
In my experience, I learned to enjoy beer
beginning with Blue Moon because of the
often-included orange garnish, which em-
phasizes the spices in the ale itself. At ﬁrst,
“garnish” for me meant several large slices of
orange, but I was able to tone down the citrus

inﬁltration over time. The drink then became
my go-to order, and I was willing to try other
beers, recommended for their similar taste.

Just don’t move up to something like a Guin-
ness until you’re sure you’re ready.

By choosing better quality beverages over-
all, young people like us are often discouraged
to drink in excess simply because we cannot
afford to upgrade from the well drinks with
the intentions of heavy consumption. When
you purchase alcohol for the sake of enjoying
the taste of the beverage itself, the experience

is entirely different.

Furthermore, it helps to be familiar with
beers and liquors of a higher quality for when
you’re outside the bubble of Oakland bars.
You don’t expect to see a case of Natty at any
cookout or dinner party in your future, do
you? No, but you can imagine that there will be
some imported beers, rather than the standard
domestic ones we’re used to seeing our peers
carry in large quantities down Bates Street.

But by all means, make sure you acquire
your classy tastes for alcohol in a polite man-

ner. If you are offered a Yuengling at a party but

are used to nothing less than a fancy imported

Belgian beer, be kind if you must refuse the
drink. Nobody wants to hear about how you
don’t drink anything brewed in Pennsylvania.

Since drinking is, legally speaking, an ac-
tivity reserved for adults, it’s time we start
broadening our horizons in terms of the booze
we choose. When you have the opportunity to
try something new, and perhaps a bit fancier
than what you would normally drink, go for it.
It might be pricier to partake in this now, but
a better-tasting beverage is worth the price
in the end. K

students, such as Mad Mex, Mi Ranchito and
Hemingway’s Cafe, are known to be open envi-
ronments forboth straight and LGBTQvisitors.

As students will recognize, these establish-
ments don’t publicly discriminate or deny ser-
vice to LGBTQ individuals.

“Because universities like Carnegie Mellon,
Point Park and Pittareso liberal, you have asink—
or—swim mentality,” Slaughter said. “If you’re not
open or accepting, there’s a chance that you’ll
go out of business because of your proximity

A to these places.”

Even with “straigh ” bars in the area hav-
ing a positive reputation among the LGBTQ
community, gay bars still have speciﬁc beneﬁts.

According to Slaughter, LGBTQ individuals
lookingfor a speciﬁc niche in their bar of choice
should know the terms of their sexuality. Then,

with, you can set the tone for the sort of night
that you want to have,” he said.

Talerico said that, when attending gay bars,
he goes in with a particular set of expectations
that he doesn’t have when going into any other
kind of bars. He said gay bar customers have a
speciﬁc kind of fun because they’re in a speciﬁc
kind of environment.

“If anything, gay bars have a community

‘ feel that suaight bars don’t. They cater to the

masses, get them drunk and then make aproﬁt,”
said Caton. “Even though gay bars do that, too,
what it comes down to is a minority and relating
to everyone there.” ' _

Echoing Henderson’s thoughts on what
brings returning customers to Blue Moon’s ami-
able ambience, Caton believes that the crucial
signiﬁcance of feeling comfortable, accepted
and natural is what makes gay bars special.

Critics might bemoan the “elitist” air
of craft brews. Butjokes of the Ivy Lager
or I-have-a-porter Porter sound like the
enviousjabs of a cheap consumer unwill-
ing to-sacriﬁce a few extra dollars for a
higher—quality beer. I can’t help but be
reminded of former Senator — and Penn
State alum — Rick Santorum’s criticism of
President Barack Obama’s dream for more
Americans to receive college degrees.

Given that even the White House brews
its own beer — infused with honey from
Michelle Obama’s garden -— it isn’t sur-

   

prising that polls before Obama’s re-I
election indicated that more Americans.
 would rather have a beer with him than-f
Mitt ‘Romney. But the history of American I P‘
craft brewers goes far beyond the most"

recent election cycle.

‘ Thomas Jefferson wished for beer to
“become common instead of whiskey,”
when he began brewing his own beer at
Monticello. President Franklin Roosevelt
could be called the grandaddy of our na-
tion’s most-consumed alcoholic bever-
age for repealing Prohibition. Surely, the
president who was the most inﬂuential
in the rise of American microbreweries
is Jimmy Carter, who lifted excise taxes
on artisanal brewers.

Yet, more than any presidential act,
the main reason microbrews are on the
rise is because-Americans arethirsty for
the creative ﬂavors and hearty tastes that
craft beers can satisfy.

Macrobreweries are responding by
adapting and diversifying their selec-
tions, which means better beers are be-
coming available from major commercial
producers. So even while small breweries
might not ever defeat Goliaths such as
Coors or Busch, they are already provid-
ing enough competition to force these
giant companies to provide us with bet-
ter, more creative products. I’ll raise my
glass to that. Q ‘

r   ATA   is

of our "common American experience, but
instead, that the rich, poor and middle
class are different.

Anéljpwhile this is not necessarily the
foundation of civil unrest (cars, liquor,
clothing, electronics, education and
countless other products are marketed

 

.as status symbols), adding beer to the

list is unnecessary. While there is virtue
in market-driven choices, there is also
virtue in egalitarianism. 7

A second complaint is that the craft
beer movement is based somewhat on

the idea that small, independent brew-
ers are superior to large, international
conglomerates. Buying craft beer is a
way to support the little guy.

If the knowledge that a beer is a local
product adds value, this is a perfectly
legitimate reason to purchase it. And
indeed, small breweries are flourishing
in this new beer environment. While the
InBev (Anheuser-Busch) and Millercoors
still dominate the market, independent
breweries have made large gains in re-
cent years.

But many of the brands some consid-
er “craft” — Blue Moon, Samuel Adams
and Corona, for instance — are actually
owned by InBev and MillerCoors.

This emotional urge to help the little

15

guy is actually, in my opinion, making
it easier for the conglomerates to trick
consumers. It isn’t villainous, and con-
sumers aren’t stupid, but subtle choices
in marketing (Sam Adam’s commercials

with bearded men pontiﬁcating about the ‘

perfect brew, for instance) allow these
companies to tap into this urge for small-
ness. We are more ripe for exploitation.
There are far greater problems with
American society than craft beer. And
maybe it isn’t really a problem at all.
But before you start shelling out huge
amounts of cash for that special brew
youjust need to have, don’t forget about
that old-fashioned American pale lager.

V V In addition to their ﬂavors, many of

" these beers boast a lower alcohol—by—vol—

ume level. Alcohol, a diuretic, can cause
drinkers to become dehydrated when they
consume beverages containing it, especially
in hot weather. The lower alcohol content
in many Ethiopian beers make them ideal

U.S. or for anyone who likes to drink beer
but also frequently engages in strenuous
physical activity.

Tucker said that, until recently, consum-
ers in the U.S. wanted beers with increasing-
ly high measures of ABV. He said that trend

is currently leveling off and “session beers,”
or beers with alcohol contents lower than
4.6 percent, are becoming more popular.

Although Meta contains 5.5 percent ABV,
Bedele and Harar, two highly rated Ethio-
pian pale lagers, are session beers with only
4.25 percent ABV.

Tucker said that although Ethiopian

breweries, like those in Japan and other

countries that learned to brew beer rela:
tively recently, usually produce pale lagers.
But some Ethiopian beers performed par-
ticularly well on his site. '
Reviewers on RateBeer favored Bedele,
which the site ranks in the 95th percentile
of pale lagers on a scale from ﬁrst to 100th.
They cited such features as a slightly sweet

ﬂavor that complements richly seasoned
‘Ethiopian cuisine. 5

The RateBeer’s users gave Harar simi-
larly positive ratings, placing it in the 91st
percentile of pale lagers and describing
it as easy to drink because of its subdued
taste of hops, a bitter ingredient used in the
brewing process. They believed that, like
Bedele, Harar goes well with spicy food. —

While Meta brands might be popular in
Ethiopia, Meta Export Lager lagged behind
in RateBeer’s rankings but still scored in
the 71st percentile for its category — well
above average. St. George, a pale lager that
Ethiopia’s oldest brewery began producing
in the 1920s, scored in the 48th percentile

‘for beers of its type. ‘

Tucker said that beer drinkers in the U.S.
have moved away from “macrobrews” —
mass—produced domestics such Budweiser,
Miller and Coors, which are available every-
where — and have begun seeking variety.
Many are choosing craft beers, which he de-
ﬁned broadly as any microbrew or import.

V Haileyesus said that Tana carries Meta
Export Lager, St. George and Harar. He said
his restaurant also carries Bedele when it is
available, although it frequently is not. In
addition, Tana carries Hakim Stout, which
scored only in the 25th percentile of its
category on RateBeer, but which some re-
viewers enjoyed because of its sweet ﬂavor.

Tana serves each of these beers at $4.50 -

a bottle, a dollar more than its domestic
drafts. -
While ‘Tucker acknowledged the limited

_ availabilitytfor Ethiopian beers, he saw Ethi-
opian beers’ labels, with their distinctive

lettering in Amharic.—— the official language
of the Ethiopian state — and less—polished
look in comparison to the labels of many
domestic macrobrews, as something many

_ Ethiopian beers have in common with other

craft beers. ,

He said that instead of advertising cam-
paigns, less well-known beers often rely
on “champions,” or people who create 10‘-
cal demand for beer after they try it and
spread the word. ,

“There’s something antagonistic about
traditional advertising in beer,” Tucker said.
“People just don’t like it, or they think it’s
a sign of a lack of quality.” E l
