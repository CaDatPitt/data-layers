garian room. Transition between

the inscription frieze giving the ﬁrst

two stanzas of the Hungarian nation-

al hymn. --
Ornamental carvings decorate the

, entrace way, the reading stand and

Robin’s egg blue
supplements the rich reds of the ceil-

ing. on the leather chairs, in the vel-
, vet window drapes, and the lining of
 the wall cabinet which holds a collec-
_   tion, of rare Hungarian glass aand

U niversity Head
Attends Annual



' Speakingubefore the Women’s Self-
Government Association’s annual of-
ficers’ night on Wednesday evening,
Chancellor John G. Bowman discus-
sed the Cathedral of Learning as a
model from which students and fac-
ulty can build their own lives and
characters.‘

Referring to our Cathedral, he
said, “Though some day people may
not think that what we have built
here is good, they will realize that
we did the best we could do.” He
added, “We must build teachers and
students like our architecture. If
students, faculty, and alumni can’t
pull together, nothing is going to
happen.”

In answer to complaints about the
University’s library and laboratory
facilities, Dr. Bowman said, “No Uni-
versity can be built in any man’s life-
time.”

Before Dr. Bowman addressed the
group, student presidents, represent-
ing their organizations, and a faculty
representative expressed what they
hoped for in the University’s “World
of Tomorrow.”

These speakers were: Patricia El-
mer, C40, president of WSGA; Joy
Hartman, Ed40, president of Women’s
Athletic Association; Margaret John-
president of Women’s
Choral; Leonore Steele, Ed40, presi-
dent of YWCA; Verne Etter, Ed40,
president of Women’s Speech Asso-
ciation; Patsy Griffith, C40, president
of the senior class; Betty Phillips,
Ed40, president of Panhellenic; and
Blossom Henry, assistant professor of
modern languages, who spoke for the
faculty.

  

 Senior
Court Sponsors

ireside Chats’

Chancellor to Discuss
Philosophies, Ideas
With Student Groups

‘; Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor
 the Universty, will resume his
'f‘ﬁreside chats” with students this
;year, according to an announce-
’inent by Mary Gregg, C40, chief
‘justice of the Senior Court‘.

3; In order that the chancellor might
informally and personally exchange
ideas and philosophies of education
with students, .and discuss pertinent
Student problems, the Senior Court of
tile Women’s Self Government Asso-
‘diation last semester sponsored the
‘fﬁreside” meetings, a dozen of which
were held during March and April.

_ Meetings Sucessful

 “We feel that last year’s ﬁreside
talks with the chancellor were very

_successful., Therefore, this year we

{hope to have as many students as

iﬁossible meet with Chancellor Bow-
.--‘-man,” Miss Gregg said.

“Invitations
;yv:11 be granted to ten students at a
time. Meetings will be held from 3
to 5 o’clock Thursday afternoons.”

‘ Students who wish to attend these
informal sessions with the chancellor
‘may request that their names be put
5pn the invitation lists. Requests will
be accepted in the dean of Women’s
‘office, in the dean‘ of men’s oﬂice by
3:’-I‘heodore_ Biddle, assistant dean of

wéinen, and by justices of the Senior

Ziourt.

 Senior Court this year includes, in
faddition to Miss Gregg, Ruth,Manns,
;Ed40; Marjorie Kuhbach, C40, Betty
Batty, E40; and Glenda Fitch, C40.
Acting as a hostess committee, ‘the
Court selects from the lists the stu-
dents who will attend the meetings.
‘ The ﬁrst‘ meeting is scheduled for
..',l,?hL_1rSday afternoon, October 19.

T ‘ e ofvCa*tl1ed'ral-  s :

Commenting on the talks last year,
Chancellor Bowman said, “To think
justly, to think to a purpose-this
kind of thinking was the kind the
people of Pittsburgh wanted from
education here, when they built the
Cathedral of Learning.

“Building for education like that is
never ﬁnished; it renews itself in
purpose and in meaning with each
new meeting of student and teacher
“Discussion in the meetings, so far,
has dealt with thoughts of how a
college or university can make the
student more than just a competent
lawyer, doctor, or professor . . . To
be quite frank about these talks
. . I am one who is learning the
most from them.”

Junior Women

To Hold Meeting

Second mass meeting for junior
women will be held Monday at 1
o’clock in 132 Cathedral to organize
the class, Mary Ruth Hosey, C, presi-
dent of the junior class, announces.

troduction of class oﬁicers and com-
mittee chairmen and a formal wel-
come to transfers.

Hosey, president; Betty Richards, C,
vice president; Kitty Kountz, secre-
tary; and Mary Hilda Fagan, C,
treasurer. Miss Elizabeth Bunner,

Dr. Wright Announces
Improved Dental Aid

Acrylic resin, the secret to better
false teeth, was revealed to the Gold-
en Gate Dental Congress in San
Francisco this week by Dr. Walter
H. Wright, professor of clinical pres-
thesis in the University School of
Dentistry. '

Materially advancing the prepara-
tion of eflicient and better-looking-
false teeth, this new transparent re-
sin will enable dentists to actually
see through their work, thus giving
more precise fittings, Dr. Wright ex-
plained. A

This discovery will also make pos-
sible the forming of the transparent
part of the bridge, having it ﬁtted
carefully, and then having the col-
ored portion which bears the teeth
moulded into it.

Psychological

Tests Offered

Psychological examinations for stu-
dents in the School of Business Ad-
ministration and the College, includ-
ing pre-education students, who
failed to take them on September 15,
will be given on Tuesday at 3 o’clock

C. Held, personnel assistant to the
Dean of the College.

All Business Administration and
College freshmen and transfer stu-
dents who did not take the tests are
required to be present.

Dr. Carroll A. Whitmer, assistant
professor of psychology, and Miss
Hannah A. Parks, graduate student
assistantin psychology, will super-
vise the tests. Excuses from other
classes can be obtained at the Col-
lege oﬂice, 1801 Cathedral.

This is the last chance to take this
test and attendance is required, ac-
cording to Dr. Held.

“challenge to the men and ‘xvomien.
of Pitt.’

It was recalled this week that the:
General Alumni Association has been}.
substantially subsidized by the Uni-5
versity since 1933. The grant, how
ever, has dropped from $21,000 i,
1933 to $11,000 during the past year

The present status of the alumn
association was indicated in Nicklas
declaration that he had been unable ,
“to obtain any deﬁnite promise -fro “
the University Administrationgofl ,
continuation of this policy,” of. sub‘
sidization. 

In calling for continued Ialuf ,
Support Nicklas declared that~9f“7

must have the largest, most.10yalf-.aiid«,

Speaking for the Alurrmi associa
tion Harbaugh Miller, ’25,' ﬁrst viii,
president, explained this week the
although the subsidization has asye
“not been deﬁnitely refused,” the as
sociation has “no assurance What,
ever that more money will be fort
coming.”  ll

Question as to what a suspen
of University subsidizattionw 
mean’ to“the aS;soci'atioﬁ§ii‘lMr5.‘.‘rM‘fE. ,
said, “I don’t think that there ,is;;;,:an
doubt that we can continue at stfori

versity aid; however, we will be un-
able to retain a paid executive«secr,e-
tary without subsidization. Alsogno“
publication comparable to the };Pl‘€_ss

‘‘Presumably, the next moveui
to the UniverSity,” said iMil;le::
“However, we cannot delay our plan‘
for the coming year, although lllwg
have been informed that a final”

will be delayed until the Universit
budgetary requirements are learn

Asked to comment on this state;
ment, Dr. John Weber, secretary 
the University, said the matter woul
be considered by the trustees later
adding that it was the general belief!“
among board members that “eventu

 The Tech Tartan

c I<‘ights a Dodo,

 4 Over on the Tech campus, the editor of the “Carnegie Tartan”
H.i8’carrying a torch for the freshmen in a campaign which is, we feel,
jilecessary and at the same time regrettable.

He is doing everything within his power as editor of a student
newspaper to abolish on his campus that out-moded practice of hazing
C frcs:<hInan men and women.

To us,‘who attend a University which puts the emphasis on
orienting the incoming students to University life instead of trying
to coerce them and frighten them with indignities which often are
injurious both physically and mentally, it seems strange that the
. “Tartan” editor must carry on this campaign at such an institution
as Carnegie Tech.

We at the University have come to realize that the freshman, sim-
;ply because he is a freshman and new to University life, has a hard
problem of adjustment to meet without our adding to the load which
he already has. He is, after all, not so different from the omniscient
_ upperclassman even though the latter does occasionally profess su-
o periority.

And we, who are upperclassmen, feel that it would be degrading
for us to stoop to any type of hazing.

_ Our freshman men wear green lapel buttons, our freshman women
-Wear green armbands, even our transfer women wear blue and gold
ribbons; but these all are only to let upperclassmen and faculty mem-
bers know that these people are new to the University, and that they
, are to be extended every courtesy we would offer to any stranger.

We thought hazing had gone out with the Dodo, and are sorry
 to see that it still does exist at some institutions. We congratulate

C, the editor of the “Carnegie Tartan,” and hope that his campaign
iiﬁneets with success.

, Might we add that we, like Tech ’s Dr; Ihrig, dean of Engineer-

I I ing freshmen, do not have a very high opinion of the mental status
‘ and accomplishments of hazers. He said,
N‘ 1: mores are usually those who haven ’t quite gotten beyond their fresh-

man year in their studies—they have the biggest paddles and the
Vbiggest mouths. They usually haven ’t passed their last re-exams.”

 We Ask for More

in full will automatically enter our ﬁle. Any letter which rcstrains
itself to -150 words or under, is signed, and is addressed to the editor,

ment proclaiming Sam Whiteman and Joe Kristufek as the tops in tennis.
Cliff claims that Carlson and Kristufek can beat Whiteman and Kristufek
any day and has issued a challenge to that effect. Sammy Whiteman, speak-
ing for his team, accepted the challenge with odds. The feud is on, and our
money is on Kristufek.

Speaking of tennis, we noticed Bob Bald, brother of Ralph, past var-
sity ace, has joined the freshman ranks. Bob captured the Harvard Cup

“What had been a. rumor for several

when an announcement concerning W'OM-

“That there actuallv ARE women de-

topic for forensic discussion in these parts.
Because of Wednesday’s announcement,
however, we now concede that an ASSO-
CIATION for that purpose exists.

“To WSA, then the campus desk offers
its profound apologies for its failure to in-
sert the story desired. But, unfortunately,
it cannot do the same to women debaters

Pittsburghers May Mix
Passes, Ground Attack

  anthers Face First Tes
  With Huskies at Seattle Tomorrow

Against Coast Eleven

 

When Washington backs start cutting up tomorrow, the success
of the Pitt defense will rest largely with the two junior linemen pictured
' above, Ted Konetsky (left) and Joe Rettinger (right).

It’s at Bet

Washington Alumni
Repeat Old Wager

When the Pitt team goes out on
the ﬁeld against Washington to-
-morrow, there’ll be more than a
football game at stake; for the
Washington alumni have bet the
.-Pitt alumni a Washington king
I ‘salmon against a box of Pittsburgh
stogies on the outcome of the game.

The bet grew out of a similar bet
placed on the 1937 Rose Bowl game
won by the Panthers 21-0. The
salmon was forthcoming.

The Pitt Alumni Association re-

ceived the following telegram on
September 21:

“Scratches and wounds inﬂicted
by Pitt Panthers on our Washing-
ton Huskies in Rose Bowl still
smart. Our Huskies are growling
for revenge. Vvashington king sal-
mon are running bigger and better.
Do you dare bet another load of
your Pitt stogies against one of our
prize salmon on the interseetional
football opener, September 30?”

Quick to take up the challenge,
the Alumni Association replied,
also by telegram: _

“The Pitt alumni happy to accept
Washington alumni’s sporting
proposition and will bet another
load of Pittsburgh stogies against
one of your prize salmon. Your
Huskies’ scratches and wounds
from Rose Bowl game may still
smart, but the Panther even though
suﬂering from ‘growing pains’ and
a ‘code’ in the head can still lick
a Huskie.”

 

Fall Practices to Begin

For Intramural Teams

Teams entered or planning to en-
ter the intramural sports program
can use Trees ﬁeld for practice from
3 until 6 o’clock any afternoon ex-
cept over week-ends. However, res-
ervations must be made at Trees gym
for the use of the ﬁeld.

Students are reminded that the

~ fall calendar has been revamped with
speedball replacing soccer and the
tennis tournament divided into two
separate groups, one composed of up-
perclassmen and the other of fresh-
men. This plan affords the freshmen
a chance to polish up on their games
and gives them a surer crack at the
University tennis team next year.

for tomorrow’s fracas.

It is assumed that “Dandy Dick”
Cassiano will serve as actin_g~captain
for the Jungle Cats when the kick-
oﬁ whistle is sounded.

“Big Chief” Kish, Emil Narick, and

V Ernie Bonelli are set to assist Cassia-

no in scoring by means of the ground
route. If this system fails to prove
useful against a
strong I-Iuskie
defense, Narick
will be called up-
on to do the pitch-
ing tor Pitt with
Dickinson, Ret-
tinger, and “Cass”
as potential re-
ceivers.

Coach Phelan
has built his at-
tack around Dean
McAdams, 190-
pound rugged lefthalf, and Don
Jones, bone-crushing fullback. Chief
interest in the Huskie line centers
about Rudy Mucha, center, who is
termed the equal of “Ki” Aldrich,
All-American from T. C. U. last
season.

Phelan ‘On Spot’

Phelan is literally “on the spot” at
Washington this year and must pro-
duce a winner to remain at the helm.
Since arriving on the scene at Wash-
ington in 1930, Phelan has been quite
successful.

His teams have scored more than
twice the number of points rolled up
by their opponents and have cop-
ped 49 victories against 26 losses
with eight deadlocks cropping up
over a period of nine years.

The best single year enjoyed by the

 

Cassiano

Huskies under the former Notre
Dame quarterback_ was 1936. The
Washington eleven won the coast ti-
tle and the Rose Bowl invitation only
to ﬁnd Pitt on the long end of the
bowl fray, 21-0.

The probable starting line for Pitt

will see Johnny Dickinson ﬂanking
one side of the line and Joe Rettinger
at the other terminal. Ted Konetsky,
who played a major part of last year
as a regular, occupies one tackle slot,
and Frank Kristufek, playing his ﬁrst
year as a member of the varsity, will
be Ted’s running mate.

“King Kong” Klein and Rudy
Gradisek at the guards, together with
Dick “Congo” Fullerton as pivot
man, give Pitt a strong trio in the
center of the line.

Strong Backﬁeld

The backﬁeld is anything but a
“nightmare” after last year’s dream.
Cassiano will remain as the left half
and is expected to bring All-Ameri-
can honors to Pitt again. Emil Na-
rick and Ben Kish at right half and
quarterback provide Bowser with
three senior backs while Ernie Bon-
elli, a junior, is a fullback similar to
Heine Wiesenbaugh who made grid-
iron history with Weinstock in ’32,
’33, and ’34.

Washington’s probable starting
lineup pits McDowell and Marx or
Yarr at ends, Nixon and Yonker at
tackles, Garretson and Holmes oppo-
site Klein and Gradisek, and burly
Rudy Mucha at center.

Jones at fullback, McAdams at the
running half, Dubsky doing the
blocking, and Bechtol as the signal
barker provide Washington with a

By Bill McElwain 
Sports Editor ,.
Contrary to a report published in one of the downtown dailliel
VVednesday, the University of Pittsburgh has not been “practically
assured” membership in the Western Conference, according to jJo*V

VVeber, Secretary of the University.

The report was drawn from two paragraphs included in the re
ular news letter sent out to members of the Pitt Varsity Lett'erm,e ’§

   

Club by club headquarters, which¢
stated:
“The announcement is expected

shortly that Pitt has been elected to —

membership in the Big Ten Confer-
ence. Nebraska also is expected to
become a member. ‘

“Our congratulations to Provost
Fitzgerald, who, as a former Iowa
University man, had much to do
with this. Not nearly so much re-
form was necessary to accomplish
this as we would be led to believe.”

Mr. Weber denied the report com-
pletely, stating that, “There has been
absolutely no action taken.”

When approached for further in-
formation, Dr. Norman Ochsenhirt,
president of the Varsity Lettermen’s
Club, admitted that the statements
included in the letter to members
were without official verification,
and added that the statements had
not been intended for publication.

In the published article, mention
was made of a number of changes
which Pitt supposedly has made in
its athletic policy to conform with
Big Ten regulations, one statement
being that Pitt has “intimated” that
it will eliminate freshman compe-
tition. An exclusive release to The

funnels of the ship were painted to
look like those of other liners.

After landing at Bremen, the Lun-
dens, who had planned to tour
France before going to the Scandi-
navian countries, went to Denmark
where they spent five days before
crossing to Sweden.

The Lundens had also planned to
visit and study at Geneva, Switzer-
land, and at the University of Heidel-
berg, Germany, before going to uni-
versity towns in Norway, Sweden,
and Denmark for a year’s study. Be-
cause of the war some of their plans
had to be changed and future plans
are not fully decided upon.
