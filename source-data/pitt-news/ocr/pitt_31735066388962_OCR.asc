Greek
Week
ends with
singing

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

Bob Kleppner of Zeta Beta Tau
and Claire Sebastian of Delta
Zeta became this year's Greek
God and Goddess and Chi Ome-
ga and Delta Tau Delta won the
Greek sing as Greek Week came
to a end over the weekend.

’’I didn't expect [to win],” said
Sebastian. ”When they an-
nounced the second and first
runner—up I thought to myself, I
gave my all and I got into the top
five and that's cool. When they
announced it, I couldn't believe
it. I was loving life.

”I feel really good because this
whole week and during [the con-
test] my sisters have been behind
me the whole way," she added.
”It was great to get out there on
stage and see them all in the front
row, cheering me on.”

The Greek God/Goddess con-
test took place last Thursday night
in the Carnegie Music Hall. The
contestants were judged in three
different events: toga, talent and
formalwear.

’’I wasn't really nervous,” said
finalistlodi Jackman of Delta Del-
ta Delta. ”| just wanted to get
through my comedy routine. And
I felt good about that. Everyone
laughed.”

Hand in
Hand day
helps
children

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Staff Writer

Forbes Quad was filled with
clowns, balloons and games
on Saturday afternoon as the

Hand—in—Hand Festival
celebrated its 10th an-
niversary.

The Hand—in—Hand Festival
is designed to bring Pitt stu-
dents and handicapped chil-
dren together for a day of
activities and entertainment.

This year, the event's theme
was entitled, ”Reach for the
Stars,” and included 29 game
booths sponsored by universi-
ty organizations, and seven
stage acts including Mother
Goose, the Terrible Fan, a
magic show, a dance ensem-
ble and a sing—a|ong.

Each of the 400 han-
dicapped children was paired
with a student escort, called a
one—on—one volunteer.

Oneon-one volunteer Jenny
Maek and her buddy Joe Bat-
tist ”had a really good time,”
Maek said. ”We moved from
booth to booth the whole time
and he won a lot of prizes. I
don't think we ever stopped.”

”I kept her working today,”
Battist said.

”Our goal is to break the
barriers between handicapped
children and the Pittsburgh
community, especially Pitt stu-
dents,” said Kelly O'Toole,
one of the two coordinators of
the event.

According to Kappa Psi
pledge Dennis Bradshaw, that
goal was realized. ”I was ac-
tually afraid to come here be-
cause I've never dealt with
these kinds of people before.
I had a good time today. It was
a good experience,” Brad-
shaw said.

Fellow pledge Ron Howard
felt the same way. ’’I had my
doubts at first, then I got here

and saw how much fun the
kids were having," Howard
said.

Howard and Bradshaw
helped with wheelchair
decorating and the bean bag
toss.

Clown Jerry Miller, a senior,
said, ’’I’m tired but it was so
much fun.

’’It was kind of neat because
I wasn't with just one person,
so I got to move around and
meet a lot of kids,” Miller ad-
ded. ’’It was really special.”

Junior Lara Mikulaninec was
also a clown at the festival.
”The kids are great. They're

Church to
sentence
Swaggart
this week

By Donna Bryson
Associated Press Writer

SPRINGFIELD, Mo. —— The As-
semblies of God hopes to lay the
Jimmy Swaggart scandal to rest
after the church's highest govern-
ing body meets Monday to dis-
cipline the television minister for
an alleged relationship with a
prostitute.

The Pentecostal denomina-
tion’s 250-member General Pres-
bytery is charged with resolving
the conflict between the Execu-
tive Presbytery, the church's
I3-member national board of
directors, and church officials in
Louisiana who have proposed
what some say is too lenient a
punishment for Swaggart.

Swaggart, the denomination’s
most prominent minister, con-
fessed Feb. 2l from his Baton
Rouge, La., pulpit to unspecified
sins. Swaggart did not elaborate
publicly, but reports have linked
him to voyeurism involving a
prostitute.

Swaggart is not expected to ap-
pear at Monday's meeting, said
church spokeswoman Juleen
Turnage.

The Assemblies’ Louisiana
Presbytery recommended a two-
year rehabilitation and a three-
month suspension from the pul-
pit for Swaggart. Turnage has said
that all other Assemblies
ministers who have confessed to
moral failure were barred from
preaching for at least a year.

The Executive Presbytery dis-
cussed the matter for 11 hours
Feb. 25 and 26 before asking
Louisiana officials to reconsider.
The Executive Presbytery, head-
ed by General Superintendent G.
Raymond Carlson, apparently
wanted tougher penalties for
Swaggart.

But after gathering again Feb.
29 for what was described as an
emotional nine-hour session, the
Louisiana Presbytery stood by its
original decision.

Reports were circulating that
Swaggart would leave the
denomination if church officials
suspended him for longer than
three months, but a spokesman
for Swaggart’s ministry said the
preacher has made no decision
on how he might react. Turnage
said she did not believe the
General Presbytery would be
swayed by ”rumors heard
through the media.”

Vanunu, former spy, convicted after seven-month trial

JERUSALEM — Mordechai
Vanunu, the former nuclear tech-
nician who said he acted as a spy
for the common man when he
gave Israeli atomic secrets to a
newspaper, was sentenced Sun-
day to 18 years in prison for trea-
son and espionage.

The sentencing climaxed a
seven—month closed—door trial
that focused worldwide attention
on Israel's nuclear capability.

The 34-year-old Israeli, who
told a British newspaper his
country possessed nuclear
weapons, was convicted
Thursday.

The charges can carry a death
penalty. But the prosecution re-
quested a life term, which Israeli
law limits to 20 years. The court
then reduced the term by two
years, citing Vanunu’s coopera-
tion with investigators, apparent
signs of regret and the difficult
conditions of his 18-month soli-
tary confinement.

Under Israeli law, Vanunu
could be released on good be-
havior after 12 years. But legal
commentators said his early
release was unlikelv Elven the

severity of the crimes.

Defense attorney Avigdor Feld-
man has said he will appeal his
client's case to Israel's Supreme
Coun.

The sentencing climaxed an af-
fair shrouded in secrecy that be-
gan when Vanunu, a 10-year
employee of Israel's Dimona
nuclear facility, gave photographs
and details of the facility to the
Sunday Times of London.

Based on that information, the
paper reported Israel had stock-
piled the world's sixth largest
nuclear arsenal.

Israel has never confirmed or
denied that it has nuclear
weapons. It has only said it will
not be the first country to in-
troduce such weapons into the
Middle East.

funding is not available, accord-
ing to a newspaper account pub-
lished Sunday.

”They’re going to be left only
two choices —— either operate in
violation of the law or close
down,” John R. Henry, a board
member of the Pennsylvania
Emergency Health Services
Council, told The Pittsburgh
Press.

”Everyone says the rural areas
of the state will be the hardest hit,
but the small services in even ur-
ban areas like Allegheny County
may be dramatically affected,” he
said.

Budget maneuvering by legis-
lators last summer diverted funds
earmarked for emergency medi-
cal services training, equipment
and personnel. But The Press
reported that few of the EMS
operators learned about the
money problems until last week,
as final touches were being made

on the rules to implement the
new standards.

”If these EMS companies are
forced to reduce or suspend their
services, we could be talking
about the actual life and death of
people, not just numbers,” said
Dr. Roger Barrette, a member of
the board of the Allegheny
County EMS Council.

General Carl Vuono,
Army chief of staff,
visits Pittsburgh

By Mark R. Brown
Staff Writer

United States Army Chief of
Staff General Carl Vuono visited
Pittsburgh last Thursday to speak
at a private luncheon and to Pitt
cadets on the high quality and
disciplined attitudes of the U.S.
military.

”The men and women in the
army today want to be
challenged. They are of the
highest quality that I've had the
honor to serve with,” said
Vuono.

Vuono said that currently, the
army has had a sharp decline in
discipline problems, desertions
and drug problems.

"Our reduced discipline
problems means our ability to
perform our missions is en-
hanced,” he said.

Vuono stressed the army's

present capabilities. ”The army
today has great momentum.
While planning for mobilization
is a challenge, we are prepared
to assist in deterrence, and if need
be, to fight to win,” he said.

Vuono went on to say that U.S.
military technology is now su-
perior to that of the Soviets’;
however, he said that the Soviet
Union ”can produce more at this
time and follow on [improved]
models of their equipment.

’’In regards to quality versus
quantity, they have the quantity,
and they are closing the gap on
quality,” he added.

Vuono said that Soviet technol-
ogy could cause concern for the
United States by the year 2000.

Commenting on the recent
deployment of army troops to
Honduras, Vuono said, ”The en-
tire 82nd Airborne Division
volunteered to jump in there. I

’’I got to know a lot of my sis-

”We all got together and did

job Robin [Hunn] and Lee [Bro-

early on before Greek Week ac-
tually started.”

’’I think everything went as
planned, even though there were
some tight spots that we had to
worry about,” said Trisha Pun-
tureri, Caevents Chairperson.

”[Greek Week] was the best it
could have been. The hard work,
the dedication to the kids at the
school,  [the greeks] took pride
in Greek Week and it showed. It
was the greatest week I ever
had,” said Brody.

Why don't we let
the courts decide?

Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh's grand jury finally hand-
ed down the first of their indictments against four of the most
visible lran-Contra players: Oliver North, Richard Secord, John
Poindexter and Albert Hakim.

ln the months since Walsh was appointed to his position,
there has been considerable controversy surrounding his legit-
imacy. Some have argued that his appointment violates the sepa-
ration of powers clauses in the Constitution, while others argue
that the evidence he gained in the first three months of the in-
vestigation is inadmissable.

All of the defendants, facing long prison terms and heavy fines
if convicted, have pleaded innocent to the charges. Again, in
the indictments, as in the report of the Tower Commission last
year, Ronald Reagan's ineffectual leadership is blamed for gross
oversights in administration policy.

Now that the Sandinistas and the Contras have signed a cease-
fire agreement and the ”Honduran invasion” has failed to
materialize, the White House mercenaries are left with little
in the way of rhetorical shielding. No matter how good he looks
on television, Oliver North will still have to answer to the satis-
faction of a prosecutor, a task for which he has an unproven
record.

Throughout Walsh's investigations, the president has main-
tained an attitude of disbelief that his aides broke any laws.
Perhaps, in light of how little Reagan claims to have known
about actions in his administration, he should leave the ques-
tions of guilt to the courts.

In a nutshell 

There is nothing new under the sun, but there are lots
of old things we don't know.

Rules for current candidates

The following is a set of rules

I'd like to propose for presiden-
tial candidates. They are basic
guidelines for decorum in the
most influential contest in the
country. I have used the male
pronoun throughout, and no
offence is intended. The current
offering of choices is completely
male, and the English language
contains no genderless alter-
native.
O The candidate, should he de-
cide to employ the services of a
marketing firm, should refrain
from making direct references to
that firm’s statistics in his
speeches.

In so doing, he permits the
public an understanding of his
commitment to the individual. A
candidate's position on an issue
should not be obviously the result
of the computer phone survey.
0 At the conclusion of television
commercials, candidates should
not give credit to the make-up
and special effects crew. Ameri-
cans have demonstrated a dislike
for a manufactured candidate ex-
cept in such cases that the label
of the manufacturer is not notice-
able (i.e., candidates should keep
their beauty secrets to them-
selves).

O While in some states it may be

ALATTHEVV
THORNTON

necessary for a candidate to
change costumes to appeal to a
certain strata of voters, such
wardrobe adjustments should not
be conducted more often than
once every two days. The voting
public does have a short
memory, but a candidate in
coveralls on Tuesday will lose
credibility if he appears in a
three- piece suit on Wednesday.

Also, candidates should not
participate in folk events of which
they have no understanding. For
example, a person wishing to be
president is not advised to join a
rodeo when he has little or no
knowledge of the sport.
0 When criticizing the policies of
the incumbent (encumbered?) ad-
ministration, candidates should
avoid committing themselves too
passionately to a point of view.
Such displays, while they may
win votes in the short term, are
a hinderance to the development
of a nationally inoffensive
campaign.

Faced with a situation where
some sort of commentary on cur-

rent policies is required, candi-
dates should confine their
statements to simple support or
simple disagreement. Television
time is expensive, and a cam-
paign too committed to any point
of view will soon run out of
money explaining itself.

0 in the interest of generating a
wide base of support for the na-
tional elections, candidates
should not snipe at their oppo-
nents in television commercials
unless there is some way to con-
strue the barb as humor (see re-
cent Supreme Court ruling in
Flynt v. Falwell).

After the convention, a candi-
date must be in a position to
receive support from his defeat-
ed party members.

0 Finally, as any policeman will
confirm, anything you say can
and will be used against you in
a court of law. in view of this,
candidates should avoid saying
anything noteworthy. When
there is a direct question from a
member of the audience con-
cerning a specific issue, the can-
didate is advised to refer to a list
of Ronald Reagan's old jokes.
Remembering Joe Biden, though,
he should always quote sources.

spective editor for The Pitt News.

There is nothing wrong with faded jeans and T-shirts

This letter is in response to Miss
Sansig, who seems to think that
she is this year's newest rock

what you think about Bruce

right to criticize someone you
know absolutely nothing about?
I really do not think that too many

people. at this university care too .

much what you think about
Bruce [...] You could at least get

. your facts straight.

Bruce does a lot more than just

‘ ”sing a few songs." He played for

three hours and 45 minutes (not
including the break, mind you).

playing that long. He also dances,
talks, tells stories and gives his
fans the best concert they've ever

i i seen him give. And who are you

to say that he is not worth the
money? A lot of people think he
IS.

And now that you seem to be
a fashion expert, saying that he
should wear something more
than faded Levis and a T-shirt.
Obviously, you do not know
what you are talking about. He
hasn't worn faded Levis at any

concert yet on this tour. They

happen to be black dress jeans.

He also wears a white dress shirt.

T-shirt the last ' hbL‘ir or so, but
who’ cares? Most of thepeople at
the sold-out-in-two-hours concert
were also wearing T-shirts. What
is wrong with a T-shirt, Frances?
He is a normal person. He relates
to his fans.

And if you think Bruce Spring-

not have the privilege of going to

Final Four teams worthy of tourney title

0 ’’I don't think we're in Kan-
sas anymore, Toto,” Dorothy
once said to her little dog in the
immortal film, The Wizard of Oz.

But another "immortal” can

I also lay claim to those words --

senior All-American forward
Danny Manning .

Manning led the University of
Kansas Jayhawks (25-11) to the
1988 Final Four in Kansas City,
Mo., with impressive victories
over Vanderbilt and Big Eight
rival Kansas State in the NCAA
National Championship Tourna-
ment this weekend.

Kansas, which lost five players
to injuries and academic ineligi-
bility this year, was never sup-
posed to make it this far in the

tournament.

But Manning, the winner of the
Naismith Award, given annually
to the best college basketball
player in the country, was not to
be denied.

He was Mr. Everything to the
Jayhawks Friday night against
Panther-killer Vanderbilt, scoring
38 points, 25 in the first half, to
lead Kansas to a 77-64 victory
over the Commodores.

In comparison, Pitt’s Charles
Smith, sometimes called the Dan-
ny Manning of the east, scored 20
points in the Panthers’ 80-74 loss
to Vanderbilt last weekend.

Manning scored 20 points
against the Wildcats Sunday to
put the Jayhawks in the champi-

Sooners have tough
time with Wildcats,
but defense keys win

By Ed Shearer

AP Sports Writer

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Mark
Plansky described it perfectly.

”That team is a time bomb
waiting to erupt,” the Villanova
forward said. "Late in the game
they just let their talent show.”

High-scoring Oklahoma,
forced into a slow tempo not to
its liking, rallied from a 48-40
deficit with 14 minutes remaining
and turned back the Wildcats
78-59 to capture the NCAA
Southeast Region championship
Saturday.

It didn't come easy for the
fourth-ranked Sooners, who had
averaged 104.7 points per game.

Oklahoma led by only three
points with 5:28 to play and by
only four with 3:49 remaining.

”A game like this shows we
win at any tempo,” Oklahoma
coach Billy Tubbs said. ”When
we're desperate enough, we'll do
whatever it takes to win.

”We even made a few free
throws at the end of this one,” he
added.

After missing six of its first 10
free throws in the game, Oklaho-
ma hit 10 in a row - two by
Stacey King and four each by
Harvey Grant and Ricky Grace -
to start a 13-0 burst that created
a 72-55 lead with just under one
minute to play.

The triumph advances the
Sooners to the Final Four for the
first time since 1947, when Holy
Cross posted a 58-47 champion-
ship game victory over Ok-

lahoma.

The run-and—gun, full-court
pressing Sooners will return to ac-
tion next Saturday in the Final
Four at Kansas City.

The semifinal foe will be the
West Region champion, second-
ranked Arizona, who defeated
No. 7 North Carolina, 70-52.

Oklahoma, 34-3, enters the Fi-
nal Four riding an eight-game
winning streak, with 20 con-
quests in its last 21 outings. The
Sooners have topped the
100-point mark in 20 games this
season, and were held below 80
for only the fifth time by Villano-
va’s near-perfect control attack.

’’In the first half I made the mis-
take of playing their game,”
Tubbs said. "I probably should
make them come to us. In the
second half, I had us pull back
and made them come to us.
When we did, that's when we
gained authority in the game.”

"I thought we played a great
game,” Coach Rollie Massimino
said. "If we had played two
halves like we played the first
half, it would have been one of
the all-time great upsets.”

The Wildcats, who finished
third in the Big East Conference,
had already forged upsets over ll-
linois and Kentucky in the tour-
nament and had dreams of
repeating their 1985 feat.

It was three years ago that Vil-
lanova went through a series of
upsets in the Southeast Region,
including triumphs over
Maryland and North Carolina in

onship round of the tournament
for the second time in the last
three years.

Kansas lost to Duke in the Fi-
nal Four in 1986, 71-67.

Ironically enough, the Jay-
hawks will again face Duke in the
semifinals next Saturday in Kan-
sas City.

The two teams have already
played once this season. Danny
Ferry and the Blue Devils
squirmed out a 74-70 overtime
victory at Kansas.

But in the land of Oz (also
known as the NCAA Tourna-
ment), anything is possible, espe-
cially for a Kansas product like
Manning.

0 Despite the loss to Kansas,
Kansas State must be pleased
with its tournament showing. The
Wildcats clawed out a 73-70 vic-
tory over highly—favored Purdue
Friday night in Pontiac, Mich., to
advance to the Final Eight. State
finished the season 25-9.

0 Duke played like a true
champion in its 63-53 victory
over top-ranked Temple Satur-
day. The Blue Devils were down
three, 28-25, at halftime, but out-
scored the Owls 38-25 in the se-
cond half to advance to the Final

Four.

If it weren't for some bad shoot-
ing by Temple, the Owls may
have stood a chance against
Duke. The Owls hit 18 of 63 field
goal attempts (28.5 percent), and
freshman sensation Mark Macon
was something less than sensa-
tional for once, scoring 13 points
on six of 29 shooting.

0 Villanova’s hopes of a repeat
of their 1985 national champion-
ship were crushed Saturday by
the Oklahoma Sooners.

Despite controlling the tempo
in the first half of the game and
holding a 38-31 halftime lead, the
Wildcats could not slow down
the high-powered Sooner offense

Elliott paces Arizona past Tar Heels, 70-52

SEATTLE — Tom Tolbert
scored 18 of his 21 points in the
second half and converted two
critical three-point plays as No. 2
Arizona defeated No. 7 North
Carolina 70-52 Sunday for a berth
in the NCAA Final Four.

The victory in the West Region-
al championship game, Arizona's

15th straight, put the Wildcats,
35-2, in the national semifinals
against No. 4 Oklahoma at Kan-
sas City next Saturday.

It will be Arizona's first trip to
the Final Four but the second for
Coach Lute Olson, who took
Iowa in 1980.

All—American forward Sean El-
liott led Arizona with 24 points
and teamed with frontcourt mates
Tolbert and Anthony Cook in a

collapsing 2-3 zone defense to
shackle North Carolina All-
American forward J.R. Reid.

Reid, a 6-foot—9, 256-pounder
who was averaging 18.3 points a
game, made only one of four
shots in the first half and finished
with 10 points.

Arizona, which failed for the
first time in the tournament to
win by 20 or more points, be-
comes the first Pacific-10 Confer-

ence team in the Final Four since
UCLA in 1980 and the first other
than UCLA since California in
1959.

North Carolina, which was
looking for its 10th trip to the Fi-
nal Four and eighth under Coach
Dean Smith, finished 27-7 after its
third regional championship loss
in four years.

Arizona went on to outscore
the Tar Heels 19-6 to open a

64-50 lead with 1:58 left on two
free throws by Elliott. The Wild-
cats held North Carolina to one
field goal during that run.

Arizona trailed 28-26 at hal-
ftime, only the second time the
Wildcats have been behind at in-
termission all year, but Elliott and
McMillan hit consecutive
3—pointers in the first 2:01 of the
second half to revive their slug-
gish team.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP)
—- Make him dribble before he
shoots. Force him left. Clog the
inside. Deny the pass.

Temple coach John Chaney ap-
preciates good defense, and it's
one good reason he gives Duke
a shot at winning its first men's
national basketball champi-
onship.

Chaney and his off-the-mark
Owls saw all the Duke defense

Saturday as the Blue Devils, 28-6,
defeated No. 1 Temple 63-53 in
the NCAA East Regional champi-
onship game and earned their
sixth trip to the Final Four.

Duke will play Kansas next
Saturday in its second trip to the
Final Four in three years.

”They are a smart, well-
coached, disciplined ballclub,”
Chaney said after his team lost for
only the second time in 34 games
and saw an 18—game winning
streak come to an end. ”| feel
they have played many teams just
as good, but they stick to their
game plan. They certainly have
the elements to become a nation-
al champion."

The Duke game plan Saturday
stressed defense, and centered on
making the Temple players do
things they were not used to do-
ing, Blue Devils point guard Quin
Snyder said.

It worked to perfection as the
Owls missed 45 of 63 shots from
the field, hitting just 28.6 percent
for the game, their worst shoot-
ing game of the season.

The major defensive work was
on the Owls’ big shooters, sensa-

tional freshman guard Mark Ma-
con and shooting forward Mike
Vreeswyk. They combined to hit
eight of 41 shots with Macon
turning in a miserable six of 29
performance that included eight
shots that never touched the rim.

After the game, Macon sat with
a white towel pressed to his face
and cried, occasionly being

hugged by a teammate. He never.

spoke.

”We felt like Macon loved to
go left and we wanted to push
him right, so Billy [King] was just
sitting on his left hand,” Snyder
said.

The key to stopping Vreeswyk,
who hit just two of 12 shots, was
making his shoot off the dribble,
Snyder said.

”He has such a quick release,”
Snyder said. ”Kevin [Strickland]

blocked a couple, and don't think
he was used to having to shoot
with someone in his face.”

The plan rarely failed, although
Duke struggled on offense until
the second half against Temple,
which entered the game as the
nation's leader in defensive field
goal percentage at .391. The Blue
Devils fell behind 17-7 early,
drew within 28-25 at the half and
broke things open with a 25-7
run in the opening 14 minutes of
the second half. That gave them
a 50-35 lead with 6:20 to go and
Temple never got closer than
eight points the rest of the way.

Duke hit 11 of 22 shots from
the field in the second half.

”We worked hard to get to this
point,” said guard Kevin Strick-
land, who topped Duke with 21
points, while Danny Ferry added
20. "We've played a lot of great
basketball teams and Temple is
one of them. When you beat a
team like that, you feel great.
We're looking forward to going
to Kansas City."

Birmingham, on its way to the
school's only national champi-
onship.

Massimino thought the Sooners
took control with 3:49 left when
Gary Massey failed on the front
end of a one—and—one free throw
opportunity.

The Sooners grabbed the re-
bound, got the quick outlet pass
and turned it into a patented fast
break, with King flamming it
home on the other end five sec-
onds later for a 59-54 lead.

Villanova ended the season
with a 24-13 mark.

King led all scorers with 28
points, Mookie Blaylock added
14 and Grant, 12.

West scored 18 points and
5—foot—9 Kenny Wilson, key figure
in Villanova’s possession offense,
added 15.

”A lot of people have tried to
slow it down against us,” Okla-
homa's Dave Sieger said. ”But
that’s the best halfcourt offense
I've ever seen, let alone played
against.”

”We were good,” ’Nova's Wil-
son said. ”They were just good
longer.”

Kumar-Terry O’Conner defeated
Whalen—Greisbaur 6-1, 6-3.

With a difficult southern road
trip behind them and 10 matches
remaining, the Panther netters are
hoping to raise their record to
15-6.

”We’|l win at least nine of our
remaining 10 games,” said
sophomore Paul Maben.

Freshman Jeff Mills is supreme-
ly confident. ”We’re starting to
play some of these northern
schools that we can beat up on.”

The Panthers traveled to
Philadelphia over the weekend to
take on LaSalle University and
Temple. in those matches, senior
co—captain Campbell was at-
tempting to break the all-time Pitt
record of 46 singles victories,
held by first-year law student
David Johnson. Campbell's
career record entering those
matches stood at 45-33.

Scores of the weekend matches
were not available at press time.

Another significant milestone
reached last week was career win
No. 100 by head coach George
Dieffenbach.

Dieffenbach, who has been
head coach at Pitt since 1976,
reached the 100-win milestone as
a result of the Panthers’ March 22
win over Robert Morris.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, March 28, 1988

Jayhawks

Continued from page 8
hawks lost to Duke 71-67 in the
semifinals. The teams met earli-
er this season, and Duke won
74-70 in overtime at Kansas.

The Jayhawks were able to
overcome Kansas State's 3-2
zone, which made it extremely
tough for them to get the ball into
the hands of Manning, a two-time
All-American.

In this matchup of Big Eight
foes, Kansas State led by two at
halftime and extended the lead to
36-29 with 18:10 to play before
the Jayhawks mounted their
charge behind their two seniors,
Manning and Chris Piper. Each
made two field goals in a 14-6
run that got Kansas the lead for
good at 43-42 with 13:51 to play.

Keith Harris stole the ball from
Mitch Richmond near halfcourt
and went the rest of the way for
a dunk. And Kansas was on its
way to playing in the Final Four
just 60 miles from its campus.

The Jayhawks, who pulled
away in the final two minutes,
took their first double-figure lead
on a layup by Barry, the son of
NBA Hall-of-Famer Rick Barry,
with 2:08 to play.

Milt Newton added 18 for Kan-
sas, while Will Scott led the Wild-
cats, 25-9 and the fourth seed,
with 18. Richmond finished with
11 to match his season low,

which came against the Jayhawks .

earlier in the season.

Neither team managed more
than a three-point lead in the first
half until Kansas State went
ahead 25-20 with 5:33 left on a
drive by Buster Glover.

The Wildcats took a five-point
lead on two other occasions, the
last at 29-24 with 47 seconds left
on a long jumper by Scott.

Barry made the halftime score

29-27 when he nailed a 3—pointer

with three seconds left in the half.
Manning, who had 10 points in
the first half, was unable to get
the ball as Kansas State packed in
a 3-2 zone. Of his five field goals,
only one came on a direct assist
from a teammate, and that was an
alley-oop play with Jeff Gueldner.
On the other end of the court,
Kansas was doing a fine job of
keeping the ball out of Rich-
mond’s hands. Scott had the
Wildcats’ first four field goals and
three of those were 3-pointers.

Richmond's first field goal was
a 3-pointer with 7:23 left in the
half, and he finished the first half
with just four points.

This was the fourth meeting of
the schools and Kansas State won
two of the first three, including
the game that snapped Kansas’
55-game homecourt winning
streak.

NCAA

Continued from page 7

and succumbed to Oklahoma,
78-59.

Villanova coach Rollie Mas-
simino showed some class by not
fouling late in the game. He
pulled his starters and inserted his
bench reserves, allowing them to
say they played in a Final Eight
game.

0 North Carolina's 78-69 win
over Michigan Friday silenced
some of the critics who said this
was not a vintage Tarheel squad.
Maybe not, but it was nonethe-
less a Dean Smith—coached team,
and could not be counted out as
a national title contender. Until
Sunday, that is.

READ

The PITT NEWS

0 Lute Olsen's Arizona Wild-
cats knocked the tar out of the
’Heels Sunday with a 70-52 vic-
tory at Seattle. All-American for-
ward Sean Elliot and guard Steve
Kerr showed why the Wildcats
were ranked No. 1 during the
regular season, holding N.C.’s

J.R. Reid to only 10 points.

0 So the pairings are complete.
Oklahoma will face Arizona, and
Duke and Kansas will play to de-
termine the national champion-
ship competitiors. Regardless of
who advances, the title game
next Monday in Kansas City
should prove to be exciting, to
say the least.
