alleged embezzling of
$6,000 by Klayman

Lisa Grzyboski
Senior Staff Writer V

Campus police and Pitt internal auditors have begun inves-
tigating the alleged embezzlement by forrner Allocations
Committee chair Gerald Klayman of over $6,000 from the stu-

' dent activities fund. <

Klayman resigned last week as both student govermnent
allocations chair and SGB presidential candidate amid allega-
tions by current board members that he allocated money to
bogus organizations while the oomrnittee he oversees was
away on summer break

The four student organiza-
tions now under investigation are
the Boxing Club, the Panther
Automobile Lovers Club, the
Captain’s Crew Club and the
University Darting Club, said
Allocations Committee adviser
Terry 

Because the Allocations
Committee is not involved in the
certiﬁcation of student organiza-
tions, said  it is not neces-
sarily certain that Klayman was
involved in the creation of some
of these organizations.

“The nature of these organi-
zations is still to be determined,”
Milani said, “as is Klayrnan’s role
in approving money for the clubs.
But his role in the creation of
clubs for his use is not being con-
sidered at the moment.”

For a student organization to
be certiﬁed, it must have at least
10 members, three of whom hold
an oﬂicer position; a faculty or
stalf adviser and a constitution.

After certiﬁcation, organiza-
tions are then permitted to submit
request forms to the Allocations

, Committee for funding of club
activities, events and speakers.

The internal audit ofﬁce will
be looking at the speciﬁc transactions involved between the
student organizations and the SGB Allocations Committee,
while the Pitt Police will be concentrating on criminal activity,
added M ilani.

Milani would not offer any infomiation about what exact-
ly Klayman is accused of, saying only that Pitt Police and
ﬁnancial auditors are “diligently working to ﬁnd the answers to
the questions” surrounding the former allocations chair.

Brian Riemer, SGB business manager and board member,
referred to the investigation as “an iffy question," saying that
the alleged misuse of student activities funds hasn’t been

Student dies in auto accident

Brian Haugh lost control of car near campus

V Nora O'Neill

Staff Writer

A memorial has been erected
at the site of the Oct. 18 automo-
bile accident that claimed the life
of Pitt student Brian E. Haugh,
22.

Haugh was the first of two
Pitt students to be killed in car
accidents during the month of
October, the second being junior
Ryan Steppacher.

Haugh was traveling on
South Neville Street two
Saturdays ago at 1:29 a.m. when
he lost control of his car while
crossing railroad tracks, and
struck a utility pole. Shortly
thereafter, he was transported to
Presbyterian University Hospital.
He was pronounced dead at 5:23
a.m. The coroner's ofﬁce listed
the cause of death as blunt-force
trauma to the chest. Haugh was
not wearing a safety belt.

Haugh was born May 23,
1975, in Harrison, Pa., to Keith E.
and Rosemary McCarm Haugh.

Haugh was a 1993 graduate
of Highlands High School and a
fourth-year pharmacy student at
the University of Pittsburgh.

He was a member of Our
Lady of the Most Blessed
Sacrament Parish, Most Blessed
Sacrament Worship Site, Natrona
Heights. Haugh was an Eagle
Scout and loved water sports,
especially water skiing. ‘

In addition to his parents, he
is survived by two brothers,

This emorial to Haugh is located nea cras site evile St.

Michael and Kevin Haugh, both
of Houston, Texas; a sister, Ann
Marie Haugh of Houston, Texas;
and his maternal grandmother,
Ann Freund McCann of
Jeannette, Pa.

He was preceded in death by
his maternal grandfather and his
paternal grandparents.

Belleﬁeld Rec Center will provide

Llsa Dl Renzo

Staff Writer

After years of climbing the
hill to exercise in Trees Hall, stu-
dents who live on the lower cam-
pus will soon save themselves
much—needed energy when the
lower campus gets its first gymna-
sium and ﬁtness center, located in
Belleﬁeld Hall.

SGB member David
Eisenberg and the co—directors for
intramurals and recreation,
Marilyn Ross and Louis Fabian,
worked together for a year to make
the Belleﬁeld gyrrmasium and fit-
ness center possible.

''I had a ﬁaternity event in
Belleﬁeld Hall about a little over a
year ago and thought it had poten-

tial to be a student recreation cen-
ter," said Eisenberg. .

The gymnasium will feature
basketball and volleyball equip-
ment, aerobics classes and a stereo
system, according to Eisenberg.

The ﬁtness area will include
exercise machines such as a lat
pull down machine, a seated chest
press, a leg extension machine and
a pee deck machine. It will also
include stationary bikes,
Stairmasters and NordicTrack
Walkﬁts.

Eisenberg said most of the
equipment in Lothrop Fitness
Center is not brand name and tends
to give students trouble.

"The locally bought equip-
ment was problematic. The new

first gymnasium on lower campus

equipment looks and works bet-
ter," he said.

The Belleﬁeld recreation cen-
ter is also experimenting with an
equipment check-out center.
Students will be able to sign out
sports equipment such as basket-
balls, volleyballs and nets, base-
ball/softball bases, frisbees and
whifﬂe balls.

As for the variety of equip-
ment in the check out center,
Eisenberg said, "We're starting
small. There will be a box where
students can leave requests for
other equipment they would like."

The grand opening will be
held from 2 pm. to 4 p.m. on
Tuesday, Nov. 4, on the second
ﬂoor of Be1lef1eld_Hall.

Interview with top companies
while staying on Pitt’s campus

Alan Blitz

For The Pltt News

Imagine graduating in December with
a job contract valued at over $42,000,

' - which includes a full beneﬁts package, a

company car and a choice of where to live
in the country. .

Most students would consider this an
impossibility. According to J. Patrick
Boyle, associate director of staffing and
programs, however, students who have reg-

istered with the Career Placement Oﬂice ‘

have had these kinds of opportunities.
Last year, 1,900 graduating seniors and
recent alumni registered with Career

Placement. Now, 82 percent of those who

registered have jobs at companies such as
Microsoft, PPG Industries, Pﬁzer
Pharmaceuticals and Deloitte & Touche.

One of the many ways Career
Placement helps students land these kinds
of jobs is by providing them with an oppor-
tunity to interview with companies on Pitt’s
campus.

"A primary function of Career

Placement are the on—campus interview ses-
sions," said Boyle.

During two six-week periods, one each
in the fall and spring semesters, over 400
companies from around the nation conduct
5,000 student interviews on campus. A

To adequately prepare for what most
students consider a diﬂicult process —
interview — the Career Placement Office
offers a multitude of services and programs.

For a resume critique or a quick job-
search question, students can take advan-
tage of the walk-in advising sessions at the
Career Placement Oﬂice in the VV1lliam Pitt
Union. Among its services to students, the
office conducts in—depth resume and cover-
letter workshops, critiques mock inter-
views, and hosts an etiquette dinner.

Every seminar is focused on some
aspect of the hiring process. To participate
in any of the Career Placement services, a
$10 registration fee for undergraduates ($20
for Alumni Association members‘ and $30
for others) is required. 0

Companies participating in a particular
week's on-carnpus recruiting session are

posted every Friday after 5 p.m. for pre-
viewing in the Career Placement Office. On
the following Monday, registered students
can turn in their resumes for potential inter-
views.

"When I went through the on-carnpus
interview process [at Pitt], I had about 50
interviews over the course of two semes-
ters," says Les Potter, a systems engineer
for Lockheed Martin Federal Systems who
has returned to Pittsburgh as a recruiter.

Three weeks after the resume drop off,
companies notify the Placement Office as
to whom they are interested in interviewing.
Companies are allowed to choose up to 13
candidates and six alternates. Larger corpo-
rations often send more recruiters to cam-
pus to interview more candidates.

Potter noted that his company's choice
of candidates is very selective.

"We're looking for students with spe-

ciﬁc skills. Those who have the intem-

ships/co—ops and the experience outside the
classroom. Those who have leamed both in
and outside the classroom," he said. \

"Today's marketplace requires that you
need to be computer literate," Potter contin-
ued. "Even in a nontechnical ﬁeld, you need
the computer skills to operate such pro-
grams as Microsoft Office. These skills are
not taught in the classroom or at the com-
pany, but obtained through the internships
and co-ops."

Students like seniors Ganett Rospach
and Chris Spittal said the programs offered
through Career Placement landed them
numerous interviews.

"Through the resume drops, I‘ve prob-
ably had l9 or 20 interviews," said
Rospach. "PPG took me to their oﬂices in
downtown Pittsburgh, and another [compa-
ny] is ﬂying me to Philadelphia for the day. "

In addition, Spittal said the mock inter-

, views helped his interviewing skills: ‘‘I took

advantage of the career—placement resume
critiques and mock interviews, and they
were all very helpful."

For more information on how to par-
ticipate in the on-campus recruitment pro-
gram, check out the Career Placement web-
site at www.placement.pitt.edu, or call 648-

Noticed more students on campus
this year?

That's because total student enroll-
ment is up 1.2 percent from last year.
Nearly 32,000 students enrolled for the
fall term, reversing an eight year
decline.

The primary reason for the tum-
around is the increased number of fresh-
men enrolled this semester —— the largest
freshman class in Pitt's history. More
than 3,100 freshmen enrolled this
semester, up 19 percent from last year.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service cites
Pitt's increased national recruitment
efforts as the major factor in this fresh-
man increase.

" [Pitt] provides good value for
money," said Service. "We're listed in
both U.S. News and Money magazines‘
Top 150 best buys. We're the only uni-
versity in Pennsylvania to make it into
both categories."

Betsy Porter, director of admissions
and ﬁnancial aid, said that over the past
two years Pitt has made moves to make
the University more nationally recog-
nized.

"The admissions office was advised
to begin implementing strategies [to

Porter. "We target areas where there was

The freshman
class is responsible for
another significant

increase —— 557 quali-
ﬁed for the Honors
College, up from 447
last year. Service said
that this indicated a
growing recognition

She said

Service also attributed the overall
student body increase to better student
retention. He said that the University

ty of student life, which included the
construction of a new indoor recreation
facility, improvements

Service, who said that
while nothing speciﬁc
has been plarmed, the University will
make efforts to accommodate a larger

"There generally has to be demand

said Service. "There's clearly a need for
additional residence halls. The demand

proved at the SGB level.

“The paperwork is clean in terms of the
pure allocations process,” Riemer said. “It
is so much more of a gut feeling than any-
thing else. Groups that you have never even
heard of doing this many things over the
summer break, things like trips, makes you
wonder.”

Commenting on Riemer’s statement,
Milani said, “Perhaps there is something
more to it than simply following allocations .
policies and procedures. That sort of gives
you a sense of why we brought in the police
and the auditors.”

SGB President Justin DalMolin said
some of the investigation centers on fund-
ing for speaker events. .

Because checks for such events
sent from the ﬁnance department directly to
those guest speakers requested by student
organizations, DalMolin said it is diﬂicult to
keep track of where the money is going.

"Those are student organizations,” he
said “I can’t monitor every student organi-
zation. Neither can anybody of SG .”

DalMolin said he was not involved in
the allocations process and that he is not
concerned about the possibility of guilt by
association.

“It was done without my knowledge,”
he said 1

Watching ”$einfeId” causes Boston man to faint and go blind

Across the Nation

BOSTON — Warning: "Seinfeld" can
be harmful to your health.

At least it was for one
Massachusetts man, according to three
doctors at a clinic in Burlington.

They say the man laughed so hard
while watching the sitcom that he faint-
ed three times and went blind tem-
porarily.

The man had a history of heart
trouble and hypertension, and doctors
found that blocked arteries reduced
blood ﬂow to his brain. They say that
when the man laughed hard, pressure
on his heart cut the ﬂow of blood to the
organ.

The doctors say the average
healthy person need not worry about
similar problems.

ROCKVILLE, Md. - It's been 59
years since Martians ﬁrst "invaded" the
Earth in Orson Welles‘ "War of the
Worlds."

A Rockville, Md., radio station
(WBIG) commemorated the Halloween
broadcast in its own way on Friday.

The station interrupted its regular
programming for a fake NASA news
conference about problems with the
Mars "Pathﬁnder." That set the stage
for a Martian attack.

By the end of the program, the
aliens had landed on the roof of a mall
in the nation's capital. Washington and
the surrounding suburbs were engulfed
in ﬂames.

The station informed local authori-
ties beforehand that the broadcast was
not real.

WHITE HOUSE —— President Clinton
set out Fridayon a three-day weekend
of fund-raising and campaigning.

The weekend included a controver-
sial retreat in Florida for which donors
paid $50,000 a couple to attend. The
so-called Autumn Retreat took place at
the golf resort of Amelia Island.
Campaign—reform advocates accuse
Clinton of selling access. The White
House disputes that, pointing to a
Republican fund-raising retreat with
congressional leaders earlier this year.

As for the Democrats, the money is
badly needed. The party is still $15 mil-
lion in debt.

Before the cash quest begins, the
president will be promoting trade legis-
lation in a meeting today with business
leaders in West Palm Beach, Fla.
Clinton ﬂies to New Jersey Sunday for
a day of campaigning there and in New
York.

CLEVELAND —— An Ohio man who

says he's tested positive for HIV may
have had sexual contact with at least 50
boys.

James Russell testiﬁed during his
rape trial that he has the virus that caus-
es AIDS. Russell was convicted last
week of kidnapping and raping a 17-
year-old boy. Authorities learned about
his possible involvement with other
boys when they investigated the rape.

A police detective in Euclid, Ohio,
says the 35-year-old man regularly
tried to recruit boys into a basketball
league he formed. His roommate told
authorities Russell brought boys to
their apartment often and may have had
sex with them.

Authorities. in western New York
are dealing with a comparable situa-
tion. They believe a 20-year-old man
knowingly spread the HIV virus to at
least nine young women.

Around the World

LONDON — After gains posted in key
Asian stock markets, trading in Europe
appears restrained after this week's
tremendous volatility.

London's Financial Times 100
Index was modestly lower ahead of the
lunch hour in Britain. Other European
markets were mixed.

The Tokyo market started lower on

the heels of Thursday's 125—point
decline in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. Then the Nikkei average
moved into positive territory, ending
with a gain of 94 points, or six-tenths
of 1 percent on the day.

Hong Kong's recently bruised
Hang Seng index rose 260 points, or
2.5 percent. Investors there remain cau-
tious about the outlook, however.

UNITED NATIONS — The U.N.
Security Council meets today to weigh
options in the face of Iraqi deﬁance.

Iraq has stepped up its challenge to
the United Nations by barring two
Americans who are a part of the U.N.
weapons inspection team. In response,
the Security Council is threatening
unspecified "serious consequences"
against Iraq if President Saddam
Hussein does not reverse his actions.
But Saddam remains deﬁant, saying he
won't back down, even if that means a
military confrontation.

The Security Council sent weapons
inspectors to Iraq at the end of the Gulf
War to ensure it destroyed all long-
range missiles and other weapons of
mass destruction as a condition for
peace. ’

A little research can make registration a lot easier

Joy Drzewiecki

Staff Wrlter

Once again the registration process has
made its way back into our lives.

It's time to think of fresh, new classes
while temporarily forgetting the hassles of
the old.

But for those who have chosen to
ignore this awakening, next sp1ing's sched-
ule may be as appealing as Oakland's
weather.

According to the Thackeray advising
staff, don't expect sudden access to an
advising session if you failed to make an
advising appointment.

"There are always certain students who

decide to wait to the last minute to contact
their advisers," said Nancy Millinary,
described by colleagues as "the desk god-
dess" of 252 Thackeray because of her abil-
ity to always remain calm during the clam-
or of registration.

"They look at me like, 'What? I can't
get an appointment?‘ And then they're mad
we can't accommodate them," said

.M1llina1y

As of now, CAS undergrads will have
to wait until after Thanksgiving to schedule.

In the meantime, all students are
encouraged to do a little research to make
the inevitable scheduling process a bit more
harmonious.

Prescheduling work can done be

checking if a class has already ﬁlled up or
by getting special permission from a
restricted class before meeting with an
adviser.

By the time a student makes his way to
the registrar's oﬁce, perhaps the yoga class
he counted on has ﬁlled up, so he should
have a couple of alternatives.

According to Polly Stabile, supervisor
of student affairs, this can make a registrars
job easier.

"When classes close, we look like the

bad guys even though we have no control," ’

said Stabile. "We become the recipients of
their aggravations."

Stabile says to keep in mind that cours-
es open and close all the time, so one should

keep checking.

It may also be a good idea to check if
there are any holds on your account, such as
immunization shots or a tuition balance,
that may prevent you from registering.

Megan Sikorski, a sophomore, wasn't
too thrilled when she couldn't register for
over an hour because of an outstanding bal-
ance.
"They sent all the information to my
parents, so I was not aware of the problem,"
said Sikorski, whose parents had to fax
their credit card number to Student
Accounts the same day.

. Furthermore, students should be
responsible for knowing the requirements
of their major course of study, and should
be aware of them before talking to their
adviser.

In most instances, the registration
ofﬁce has information sheets that contain a
detailed checklist of course requirements.

To make registration more eﬁicient,
Pitt Star, which links advisers‘ computers
with Thackeray Hall, enables many stu-
dents to register directly with their adviser
instead of waiting in line at the registrar’s
oﬂice.

A student who ﬁnds that he must make
his way to the registrars office should
remember that he needs his advisers John
Hancock.

The only students who do not are those
emolled in CAS who add/drop classes. All
other items require a signature.

The once bare walls of Pitt's law
school lobby are now filled with mem-
orabilia from the past.

On Saturday, the Alumni
Association of Pitt's School of Law
dedicated a museum to the law school
in the first ﬂoor lobby. Like most cam-
pus structures of its day, the 1970s
building was designed to be functional
and cost effective, not to harbor muse-
um exhibits.

The School of Law was founded in
1895, and was originally located in the
Allegheny County Courthouse in
downtown Pittsburgh. In 1897, the
school moved to the Pittsburgh
Academy Building on what is now
Forbes Avenue.

Major events like World War I and
the massive ﬂood of 1936 forced fur-
ther moves, and the school eventually
found itself in the Cathedral of
Learning, where it remained for 40
years.

The Pennsylvania Legislature
approved funding for a new law school
building, and groundbreaking took
place in 1972, although the school's
ofﬁcial opening was in 1976 when
classes were first held in the present
facility.

There was little money in the bud-

ﬂoor lobby through which‘ students,
faculty, alumni and visitors pass on

THE PITT NEWS

their way to the Barco Law Library.

This past year, the Law Alumni
Association decided on a way not only
to decorate the busy lobby, but also to
acknowledge the law school through
photographs, trophies, plaques and
other memorabilia noting the achieve-
ments of the graduates who earned the
school its distinguished reputation.

"We felt it was important from the
standpoint of students and alumni to
have a historical museum which shows
the growth of the school from its
inception to the erection of the separate
law school building in which it is cur-
rently house ," said Marvin S. Lieber
(class of 1958), outgoing president of
the Alumni Association.

"With this historical museum in
the lobby, perhaps students, faculty
and alumni will have a better sense of
where their law studies can take them,"
Lieber said.

"Part of what make educational
institutions great is a sense of their his-
tory," added School of Law Dean Peter
M. Shane. "Great schools have values
that endure as they progress, even as
programs grow and change."

The inspiration for the museum
project came from the law school's
centennial celebration in 1995, which
gave alumni, administrators and facul-
ty an opportunity to review the school's
history and achievements. They dis-
covered that most people in the region
do not know how Pitt School of Law
graduates have become an integral and

inﬂuential part of our larger social and
political history, and how these faculty
and graduates have shaped and
improved the times in which they have
lived, both as profes-
sionals and as citizens.

One of the key
women whose memory
is preserved is Sara M.
Soffel (class of 1916).
Soffel was the first
woman to graduate
from Pitt's law school.
She went on to become
the first female judge in
Pennsylvania upon her
appointment to the
Allegheny County
Court in 1930, and was
then elected in 1941 to
the Court of Common
Pleas. -
Robert Lee Van. =-
(class of 1909) is also
commemorated by the
museum. Van was the Pitt School of
Law's first African-American graduate.
He served as the assistant solicitor for
the city of Pittsburgh, was publicity
director for Calvin Coolidge's presi-
dential campaign and also helped to
found the Pittsburgh Courier, which
became the most inﬂuential black
newspaper in the country.

"One of our goals will be to come
as close as possible to displaying pho-
tographs of every person who ever
studied or taught at Pitt law school,"

‘Monday, 3 November 1997

Law school museum unveiled to exhibit school's growth

said Dean Shane. "Like our graduates,
our faculty have also affected the city
and region that surrounds them.
Faculty members such as Professor
John Burkoff, recently
appointed to the
Civilian Review Board
of the Pittsburgh
Police, and Professor
David J. Herring, who
also helped start
Allegheny County's
Court-Appointed
Special Advocate pro-
gram, have long played
a prominent role in
community service, as
well as in teaching and
scholarship.

"This alumni historical
museum illustrates
how a. vibrant law
school makes a differ-
ence to the region it
inhabits," added
Shane.

The museum also preserved mem-
ories of the law school's architectural
past, including a move into ‘its own
building, where Forbes Field stood.

Other photos show the partially
demolished Forbes Field as seen from
the 15th ﬂoor of the School of Law,
which occupied three ﬂoors in the
Cathedral of Learning.

Shane urged Pitt School of Law
alumni to donate their memorabilia to
the museum.

Do your part to keep
the Pirates in town

Vote YES tomorrow.

Vote YES~for the Regional Renaissance Initiative and
try to help revitalize this city. Remember that this is not a
“stadium tax,” and that it will help the whole area.

Keep in mind that Allegheny is the only county with
a chance of passing this bill, and that without it the city
carmot possibly afford to survive as the second-smallest
market for a Major League Baseball team.

Realize that if they don’t get a new stadium to play in,
the Pirates are most likely going to leave Pittsburgh.
Forget for a minute the jobs that would be lost and the
business that would disappear for stadium workers and
merchants and vendors throughout the city. Ignore all the
revenue that Major League Baseball brings into the city.

Do think about what we’ll lose first trying to keep the
Pirates without the help of that 1/2 cent sales tax.
Consider that Mayor Murphy (who is almost certain to
win re-election) will do almost anything not to lose this
city’s baseball team and will start by taking money from
other sources, and in the beginning that will most likely
come from our public library system. Imagine what will

happen to public programs that lose funding when city”

officials scramble not to lose one of the largest sources of
city revenue. .

Consider this small tax increment a beneﬁt to the
whole city budget and everything it funds. Imagine
Pittsburgh with a new park or playgrounds, and a cleaned
up downtown.

Contrast that with trying to drive on unsalted snow-
and—ice—covered roads on a Saturday in January to get to
a library only to find it closed. .

Worry about the city spending other money trying to
save the Pirates, and it not working, and them leaving
anyway.

Think of how much fun eating a hot dog and watch-

_ ing the home team win a big game would be than waiting

in the cold for a PAT bus that never comes when it snows.
Vote YES Tuesday, not just for everything we’d lose,
not just for everything we’d gain, but for both.
Help revitalize Pittsburgh. .

Ever been to the ‘super-

bags of candy,’ such as
M&Ms, which contain about
a dozen little
They’re usually called multi-

lpacks, omnipacks or any

number of dazzling prefixes
one doesn’t usually associate
with candy.

Inside these supercal-
ifragilisticexpialadocious
packs are little “fun—size
packs.” In candy-manufac-
turerspeak, “fun” equals one-
quarter the size of pack one
can buy separately at a rack
in the front of the store by the
checkout.

Which brings me to a
grotesque conversation I
overheard on the train home
a couple of weeks ago,
between two women in
Pennsylvania Culinary uni-
forms. One woman said her
boyfriend had a “fun—sized
[thing].”

I’ In — not an eavesdropper,
but phrases like that tear me
away from my reading, in
this case a cliffhanger chap-
ter on “Price Elasticity of
Demand.” As an Englishman
who tries to balance gentle-
man, madman, anarchist,
satirist and revolutionary all
in one, I still feel queasy
talking about or hearing any-
thing sexual in nature.

Mention the word nipple,
and I get goose bumps. But I
almost burst out laughing
upon hearing “fun-sized

packets?

Well, I was astonished.
Women talking about men’s
genitals in the same way that,
er, men talk about female

-genitalia. In fact, should we

really be so graphic in coni-
versation on this topic? Chef
wannabe No. 1 continued to
tell her friend that her
boyfriend ﬂipped her like a
burger and whipped her like a
milkshake. Why should her
friend care? Does she need to
know about this boyfriend’s
particular penchant for anal

sex? Why did they have to

talk so loud, letting 50 or so
people know what their
favorite position is?

The critical difference
between men and women on
conversations about sex is
that women tend to probe
every detail of an encounter,
whereas men have a tendency
to lie.

“I nailed her good,”
would be the line given to
friends by the boyfriend.

The girlfriend would say
something along the lines of,

“‘Well, he’s okay, but I wish

he wouldn’t grunt or fart
while we’re doing it.”
Hence, this boyfriend
could have two nicknames
from two sets of people:
studmeister and orgasmofart.
The sex-crazed culture of
the 90s is to blame.

some assistance, while Adam

usually makes jokes about,

offers to nail the caller’s sis-
ter as a form of cure, much to
the audience’s amusement.
Celebrity guests — world-
renowned physicians like
Slash, Bobcat Goldthwait,
John Waters and RuPaul --
throw in their sordid two
cents. ,

The point is, people seem
to be a bit too eager to talk
about sexual dysfunction
with these total strangers.

Now, I’ve had many
problems, mostly romantic,
but I’ll never ever tell the
likes of you, or anyone else
for that matter, the details.
I’ll keep them to myself,
thank you very much. And
I’d never ever try to probe or
badger anyone else
releasing details of their sex
lives, unless of course they
insisted on telling me. But I
wouldn’t advise it, as I’m the
worst person to talk to on
these matters. You won’t find
a column with the title
“James Maude — ‘Agony

I appeal to you all: Keep
your sex lives to yourselves.

Cashing a check never used to require DNA testing

Heather

Barnett

THE SCENE: A bank in the Oakland
neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pa.,
9:30 a.m. Three people are in line,
having first threaded their way
through the velvet-roped rats’ maze
that is apparently meant to prevent
patrons from breaking into energetic
Broadway-style dance numbers
while waiting for a teller. '

A student waits, little suspecting
that her plan of cashing a check
before her first class (the W-section
of Philosophy of Household-
Appliance Repair) is going to be far
more of an adventure than she ever
planned. For this simple bank trans-
action is about to take an unexpect-
ed detour — a detour that will take

her miles away from food, gas and

lodging; a detour that will land her
smack into the heart of  The
Bureaucracy Zone.

TELLER: NEXT!

CUSTOMER: (steps up to window)

Hi. I want to cash this check. (Hands «

check over with driver's license)
TELLER: (picks up check; slowly

focuses vision on the small print)
Do you have an account with us?
CUSTOMER: No.

TELLER: We need another form of

TELLER: Don’t worry. The ink’s
nontoxic.

CUSTOMER: (obliges, albeit with a
dirty look) ,

TELLER: Thank you! Could you
lean over a bit, please?
CUSTOMER: What for?

TELLER: We’re going to need a hair
sample.

CUSTOMER: Look, this is just ridic

TELLER: Ma’am, if you continue to
be belligerent, we’ll have to call in

CUSTOMER: But I ...(sighs) OK,

all right. (leans forward)

TELLER: Alrighty! (produces pair
of garden shears from behind
counter, snips ojf lock of customer’s
hair) There. It hardly even shows.
CUSTOMER: Now can I have my
money?

TELLER: (hands customer a cup)
FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
CUSTOMER: (sets a vial of blood
and a urine sample on the counter;
folds hands) Now may I have my

. money? .

TELLER: You know that we charge
a $3 fee to cash checks, right?
CUSTOMER: But it’s drawn from
this bank, isn’t it? This IS
CitiNationalAmeriBankCorp, right?
TELLER: (laughs gently) No, no
We’re not.

CUSTOMER: (mortiﬁed) Oh my
God! I’m so sorry! I must not be

CUSTOMER: (reading) “Join the

TELLER: We’re very excited about
this change. We believe it will help
usher in a new era of customer ser-
vice.

CUSTOMER: I’m sure it will. Can I
get my money now?

TELLER: Of course, ma’am. (counts
out the bills, pushes them across the
counter)

ested in opening an account with us?

You s|1ou|c|n’tbe teaching if you can’t speak the language

Dan

Ertman

Sometimes I don’t know
whether to laugh or cry.

She stands up there in
front of the few of us who still
bother to come to recitation,
and slowly plods and butchers
her way through the question.

Webster and all other
grand masters of the English
language are doing impressive
gymnastic routines in their
graves by the time she is done.

Sometimes, I don’t know
from where they get them.

Finally, ‘she writes a ques-
tion up on the blackboard.
“How much money does the
person should have at end of
six month?” it reads.

Ouch. My language hurts
at this effrontery.

It would seem to me rela-
tively easy to determine who is
and isn’t qualified to teach.
Apparently, it isn’t, because
this problem isn’t entirely the
fault of this poor TA. Most of
the fault goes to the ones who
hired her. More often than not,
TA stands for “Theuniversity
Assumedicouldteach.” More
often than not, the University
«is wrong. It is therefore partial-

ly-in criticism, but mostly as a

tool for this University to use
in" future selections and to
atone for past sins, that I offer
my DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO
WHO SHOULD AND
SHOULD NOT BE A TA.

1. IF YOU CANNOT
SPEAK ENGLISH, AND
PASS AN ENGLISH FLUEN-
CY EXAM, YOU SHOULD
NOT BE A TA AT PI’I'I‘!!

This one is pretty obvious.
Those who can not speak our

official language can’t teach in

it, either. This is not racist. It is
logical. We, the students of
this University, should NOT
have to hire a translator to
interpret our instructors. I
don’t know what the require-
ments are to become a TA, but
one of them most certainly
should be an English-ﬂuency
exam, or at least an interview.
2. IF YOUR KNOWL-
EDGE OF THE MATERIAL
IS NOT FLAWLESS, YOU
SHOULD NOT BE A TA!!
Once again, I feel this is
pretty obvious. I personally
hate it when a TA, upon being
asked a question, regardless of
difficulty, begins to stammer,
look confused, and stall for
time. If you cannot solve every
problem (the very first time

teaching out of, the material is
too difﬁcult for you to teach.
Therefore, it is probably not
wise to put the ﬁrst-year grad

 

sufﬁcient time to explain an
entire concept again. It is
therefore generally the TA who
gets the completely ‘dumb-

student in founded stu-
charge of the ' dents who

also easily per- Therefore, if
suaded to stop the TAs also

coming to recitation, especial-
ly if we believe nothing useful
can be gained by attending. A
less-than-perfect TA perfor-
mance is usually all the
encouragement we need.

3. IF YOUR SCHEDULE
DOES NOT PERMIT YOU
TO‘ GET TO CLASS ON
TIME AND HAVE TIME
FOR STUDENTS TO COME
SEE YOU, YOU SHOULD
NOT BE A TA!!!

This is a little less obvious,
so I’ll elaborate more. The pur-
pose of a TA is generally to
cover and clear up material
that the students did not under-

’ ' stand in the lecture. Pijofessors, r
you see it)=i1i the book you are‘ ' as a general rule; ‘do not have ~

 

don’t have any time, they are
not fulfilling this need that the
students have.

As for coming to class on
time, that should be blatantly
obvious. If we have to be in
our seats at 11 a.m., TAs
should be up in front, ready to
get started at 11 a.m. I under-
stand that occasionally some-
thing happens, but making it a
continual habit for either one is
not generally acceptable.
Furthermore, if all through
your learning years you were
late for class, I personally
believe the trend is more likely
than not to continue through

'your teaching years. The guy
I‘ who walks in half an hour ‘late

every day should therefore
drop all hopes of teaching the
class one day.

I realize these are some
very strict guidelines (cackle),
and more than likely would
rule out half of the TAs cur-
rently employed here. But I
can name at least one who def-
initely survives my test. His
name is Jim Zahorchak, and he
TAs for Pete Siska’s honors
chemistry class. I hold him up
as an ideal, a model of a per-
fect or at least nearly perfect
TA.

All other TAs should be
required to take honors chem
and sit in Jim’s recitation just
so they’ll know how it’s sup-
posed to be done. He’s usually
on time to class, he speaks
English perfectly, he has all
the time in the world to explain
wave—particle duality, and
(shock!) he’s had every prob-
lem in the book done and
memorized for a long, long
time. I wish the same could
bae said for my and all other
students’ other TAs.

Dan Ertman thinks teaching
assistants should be able to
teach and assist students

’ rather’ than‘ requiféjissistance
‘ with teaching.‘ ‘‘ ‘ "  ’ ’

Religious freedom should not put others’ Iivesat risk  

Jennifer

Stoltz

The safety of thousands
versus thefeelings of one.
Since when is there a debate?
When a student here at the
University complains about
the no-ﬂame policy in the
dorms, I believe they should
be heard, especially when it
comes to religious beliefs.
But, in the case of the student
who wants to “smudge” in his
dorm, I don’t believe that Pitt
should bend the rules.

Smudging is part of the
Lakota Indian culture, which
the student in question is a
member of. The practice is
part of their religious beliefs
and is meant to purify some-
one’s home, and the sweet-
smelling smoke that smudg-
ing makes is supposed to
carry away evil or negative
thoughts. The student in ques-
tion calls it essential to his
religion.

I do believe in freedom of
religion, but I also believe in
limitations. If one person’s
rights infringe on the rights of
others, and on as big of a
scale as this, we can’t just

give in. Officials suggested to
this student that he could burn
the sage in question outside,
in a University-owned apart-
ment, or in the lounge of the
student union. He is objecting
to_all of these. Also, in a local
paper, it was stated that this
student “cannot prove his her-
itage.” Although I personally.
do not think that this is the
case, how do we honestly
know this is not aiploy?

The University’s policy
on ﬂames of any kind is very
specific. And I like it that
way. I personally do not want
to have to deal with a fire in
the dorms. So, any way possi-
ble that fires can be prevented
is worthwhile. The student in
question was quoted in the
North Hills News Record as
saying, “the honor of one is

the honor of all.” Well, did he -

ever think that the beliefs of
one could cost us the safety of
all? Most likely, his intentions
are good, but the University
must look at the big picture.
An incident last year
occurred when a student acci-
dentally destroyed his room
when lighting a large amount

of incense. Luckily, no one

She said

was hurt, and the fire did not
spread. However, do we real-
ly want to take that risk
again?

Also, if Pitt allows this
student to commence with his
sage-burning practices, it’ll
soon be faced with a ﬂood of
similar pleas. And, it’ll be
forced to grant those wishes,
too. I, as a Roman Catholic,
could tell -Pitt that I want to
light prayer candles or Lenten
candles in my room. But, I
also realize what a devastat-
ing consequence this could

potentially have, so I would

never go to the University to
make such a request. Despite

’ smudging is

   

my own religious convictions,
I wouldn’t want to put anyone
at risk. N o matter how careful
one is, the danger is always
prevalent. And in the close-
set, small rooms of the“resi-
dence halls, fire would spread
rather quickly.

The student believes that
sometimes
banned due to ignorance.
While this is probably true,
the student is actually igno-
rant himself. He mustn’t real-
ize the horrific impact that his
actions could have. His faith
cannot possibly ask him to
put so many others at unnec-
essary risk. Most religions
promote love and acceptance.
His beliefs can’t honestly
condone endangering others.

This country thrives on a
system of majority rules and
minority rights. That’s why I
feel the protesting student’s
case deserved to be heard,
but, in this instance, it should
not go any farther. _

The Lakota student wants
to become a medicine man
and eventually would like to
live in the plains while prac-
ticing his faith. This is a noble
goal, but even as a medicine

 

man, he would not be able to
make up for the possible dis-
aster of , a fire igniting.
Medicine men believe in heal-
ing, but also in the warding
off of sickness. Smudging

-itself is supposed to ward off
. evil and negativity. So he

must realize that putting him-
self and others in such a pre-

carious position would -be"

actually inviting disaster.

Freedom of religion is a
very important aspect of our
society. It is a right that is
often overlooked and not
taken seriously. However,
there is also another right ——
the right to life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness. If,
God forbid, a fire ignited in a
residence hall here at Pitt, stu-
dents might not be able to
pursue any of these rights.
The safety of the University’s
resident students is at stake,
and I don’t want to put that
responsibility into one per-
son’s hands.

Jennifer Stoltz would also like
to burn her vanilla candle
but, for the safety of all, has
left it on her dresser at home
with no argument.

to Pittsburgh.

low sports join the crowd of die-hard‘

Bringing new stadiums to this

ize that your city must be a wonder-
ful place. Do yourself a favor and

Death penalty
is NOT a

necessary evil

One passage in particular from Carrie
Hager’s screed in favor of executions (“All
murderers must fry!” from the Oct. 8 issue)
caught my attention: “Our justice system
isn’t perfect, and perhaps once in a while an
innocent person is executed. That is sad, but
is a necessary evil ...”

Really? Since Ms. Hager ends her col-
umn with an appeal to the personal feelings
of anti-death penalty advocates, I would
like to ask a personal question of her: If she
were that person at the wrong place at the
wrong time, and were accused of a crime
she had not committed, would she consent
to go to the death chamber as a “necessary

I

 

tion for “countries where an eye-for-an-eye
system of law enforcement is still in place.”
She fails to ‘give examples. Perhaps it
would be too diﬁicult to sell us on the the
virtues of Saudi Arabia, where women can
be executed for driving automobiles; or of
China, which carries out thousands, of exe-
cutions per year, and also doesn’t shy away
from the use of slave labor; or of Indonesia,
which has no problem using execution
(legal or extrajudicial) to keep those pesky
labor activists and East Timorese in their
proper place.

Regarding the death penalty’s alleged
powers of deterrence, perhaps she’d like to
explain why the Scandinavian countries,
which‘ have no death penalty, also have
armual murder statistics in the single digits.
I’d suspect it might have something to do
with their relative economic egalitarianism,
as compared to the atrociously class-divid-
ed, high-murder—rate, execution-happy
United States. But that’s just me, I guess.

Patemo likes to say he doesn’t run
up the score. I ﬁgure one of two possi-
ble situations is going on here.

The first possibility: Patemo is just

‘ stupid for not running up the score. If

that’s what it takes to garnish a No. 1
ranking in the eyes of the writers and he
doesn’t do it, is he really the all-world
coach everyone thinks he is? An all-
world coach should do everything pos-
sible to become national champ.

The second possibility: Patemo is
saying he’s not trying to run up the
score to make himself look better.
Remember when he had Heisman
Trophy candidate Curtis Enis in the
game when Penn State was beating Pitt
34-3 in the fourth quarter?

If Patemo really isn’t running up
the score out of respect to the opposing
coach, I respect that —— it’s good sports-
manship. But don’t go and bitch when
you drop in the rankings. JoePa’s been
around long enough (way long enough)
to know how the system works.

Here’s the thing that really gets me:

n’t earned a No. 1 ranking so far this

Rain, Dwayne can't stop the Eagles

Fourth -quarter comeback ’
pushes BC over Pitt, 22-2i

Matt Townsend

Assistant Sports Editor

In the monsoon and the
muck of Boston _ College’s
Alumni Stadium, Pitt won 58
and a half minutes of its
Saturday tilt against the BC
Golden Eagles. .

But football games are an
hour long.

While leading 21-19, line-
backer Eric Kasperowicz
pounced on a questionable
Boston College fumble at the
Eagles’ 31 with a little over
three minutes remaining in the
fourth quarter. After three plays
by the Pitt olfense netted ﬁve
yards, Pitt Head Coach Walt
Harris optedtopassfortheﬁrst
down rather than send out a
shaky ﬁeld goal unit that had
already botched one try earlier
in the game.

Pitt didn’t convert and

remaining. Eight plays later,
Jason Malecki ﬂoated a 34-
yarder through a driving rain to
steal the victory from Pitt, 22-
21. A .

“This is a tough loss,” said
Hanis. “We played hard for
most of the game, but oou1dn’t
get itééne in the end.”

, I the end, with just a few
ticks left on the clock, quarter-
back Pete Gonzalez had his
boys marching for the game
saving win. After a Billy West
kick ietum spotted the'Panthers
at their own 26, Gonzalez hit
ﬂanker Terry Murphy on a
quick post for 12 yards. After
an incompletion, split end Jake
Hoﬂ°ait hauled in one of his 10
catches on the run and bullied
his way upﬁeld to the Eagles’
46-yard line. Next, a defensive
hold in the secondary pushed
the ball to the 36 with 58 sec-

Panther hoops wins first exhibition, 92-85

Ned Schano
Senior Staff Writer . ..

The “new look” Pittsburgh Panther

, basketball team opened its exhibition sea-
i son last night with a 92-85 victory over
i the California AH-Stars.

Six freshmen saw action for the
Panthers, with first year center Attila
Cosby leading the team with nine
rebounds while adding 14 points. Junior
point guard Vonteego Cummings, last
season’s leading scorer at 16.3 points per
game, picked up where he left off, scoring
a game high 21 points with six assists.

Along with sophomores Kellii
Taylor, Isaac Hawkins and Jarrett
Lockhart, Cummings is one of just four
returning lettermen on the Panther squad.

Head Coach Ralph Willard said he
liked what he saw from both the freshmen
and the older players.

“I thought we did a lot of good things
oﬁensively,” Willard said. “The eﬁoit

times.” _

The Panthers have had just 13 days of
practice this season and have yet to com-
plete a full court scrimmage. Wrﬂard said
he didn’t think Pitt was inproper game
shape for this exhibition but that he
expects his tearrr to be well-conditioned
by the time the Panthers open the regular
season on Nov. 17 against Bucknell.

The Panthers controlled the action in
the ﬁrst half against the All—Stars, a team
composed of former college players.
Lockhart, who converted all three of his
shots behind the arc, threw in two early
three-pointers to put Pitt ahead 10-8 at
17:36, a lead the Panthers wouldn’t relin-
quish.

Cummings had a strong first half,
scoring 10 points in a performance high-
lighted by a streaking layup at 15:24. The
Pitt lead ballooned to 14 points at 12:34
following a Cosby layin.

Cummings made a highlight reel
steal with 2: 19 left in the half, then a beau-
tiful unélerhanded alley-oop to freshman

The second half opened with another
Lockhart tlrree-pointer followed by a
Taylor steal and a Cummings layin at
14:50. The Panthers looked ﬂat for the
next seven minutes, with Cosby’s six
points supplying all the oﬁense in that
span.

Dreher at 7:43 cut the Panther lead down

to one point at 70-69. The Panthers recti-
ﬁed their sloppy _play late in the half

ished off the All-Stars with 1:02 left in the
game.

Freshman forwards Michael Shin,
Greer and Cosby all saw considerable
action in the game, with Shin receiving a
start in his first collegiate appearance.

men to start in the home opener.

Freshmen catch fire vs. All-Stars

Zachariah Blott

News Edltor

During Pitt’s 92-85 exhibition win over
the California All-Stars last night, the crowd
witnessed what Pitt’s four returning players
are able to contribute to the team this year“.

- Vonteego Cummings can ﬁnish.

- Kellii Taylor can steal the ball —— from
anyone.

0 Isaac Hawkins can make the athletic
shots inside.

- Jarrett Lockhart can drain the three.

More importantly, though, the sparse
Fitzgerald"Field House crowd got to watch
the team’s six freshmen play in their first col-
legiate game, albeit not an oﬂicial one.

The first freshman the 2,035 attendees
saw in action was 6—foot-8 forward Michael
Shin. Assistant Coach Jim Christian told
Shin he would start the contest during warm-
up drills before the game.

wasn’t really surprised.”

His excitement may have carried over
into the game, where he missed both of his
two shots and made only two of ﬁve free

, throws to ﬁnish with two points. He added

two rebounds and two turnovers to his sta-
tistics before fouling out with 5:56 left in the
game, after seeing 19 minutes of action.
Coach Ralph Willard said Shin did “the
little things that don’t show up in the stats.”
“He passed extremely well out of the
post and set some good picks,” said \V1l1ard.
Athletic center Atilla Cosby had the best
statistics of the freshmen. He made seven of
nine shots -- mostly on quick spin moves
past defenders, and hook shots from 10 feet
from the basket -—- to ﬁnish with 14 points,
second only to Cummings’ 21 for the
Panthers. In addition, he grabbed nine

rebounds, tops for the contest, and dished out:

two assists.

“Before the game I was nervous,” he
said. “A lot of things happened today that I
didn’t expect. I didn’t think I’d have 14
points or nine rebounds.”

Guard Ricardo Greer ﬁnished third on
the team with 13 points, draining a three-
pointer, four shots near the hoop and two
free throws. Being guarded by players as
much as ﬁve inches taller than himself for
most of the contest, the 6—foot—4 Greer relied
on his strength and athleticism to muscle and
shake-and—bake his way under the basket for
layins. Also, he was able to display his awe-
some leaping ability on a crowd rousing

a1ley—oop late in the ﬁrst half.

Forward/center Kevin Leslie used his 6-
foot—8, 255—pound frame to power under-
neath for a strong putback rebound to earn
his only points and only rebound of the
game. His speed and footwork were suspect,

“I was truly excited,” said Shin, “butl 

Stephen Flores, a 6—foot-8 perimeter
player, got in the game for ﬁve minutes and
made one three—pointer. He was tentative on
defense, but dribbled and passed the ball
with conﬁdence away from the basket.

Guard John Finneman, known for his
three—point shooting ability, missed two
shots in only two minutes of action, but con-
tributed with a rebound and an assist.

“I thought some of the freshmen did
some good things,” said Wrﬂard about the
freshmen’s performances. “We haven’t even
scrimmaged yet in practice, so this came
after only two weeks of practice.”

Cummings said that not having scrim-
maged yet hurt the play of the freshmen but
that the six new oollegians are working hard.

“I see a lot of hard work with this
group,” said Cummings. “They work a lot

THE PITT NEWS

Soccer (1 near-miss for conference tourney

Patrick Robertson

Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh men’s soccer team’s sea-
son does .not end officially until Tuesday,
but its postseason aspirations died this
weekend after it did not get the help it need-
ed from other Big East teams.

Pitt came into this weekend needing a
lot of things to happen for it to make the Big
East Tournament. It also planned on win-
ning its two nonconference games for a
boost.

The Panthers won their games but could
not control the University of Connecticut’s
sudden—death victory over Seton Hall. This
game knocked Pitt out of the Big East
Tournament.

Pitt misses the Big East Tournament
despite being ranked in the Top 25 national-
ly for four of the last ﬁve weeks. i

“The Big East was very strong this year,
and there was really nothing we could do,”
Head Coach Joe Luxbacher said.

The Panthers ﬁnished the year with nine
points in the Big East.

Luxbacher said that “every other year,
nine points would have gotten us in, but not
this year.”

A team earns two points for winning a
conference game and one point for an in-
conference tie.

Pitt lost three Big East games in a row
during the last week in October to UConn,
Seton Hall and St. John’s. Either a win or a
tie in any of these three games would have

propelled Pitt out of a conference—season-
ending tie with UConn, Notre Dame and
Boston College.

‘‘It was a difficult week. “We had so
many opportunities to get the job done, but
we didn’t. Good teams find a way to get it
done when given the opportunity,”
Luxbacher noted.

Three of the four tied teams would earn
a berth in the Big East Tournament. The first
tiebreaker is head—to-head games, which Pitt
lost because it tied BC and Notre Dame.
After this, the conference looks at Big East
victories —— a statistic that would cost the
Panthers, because three of their nine points
came from ties.

.“We needed the Seton Hall game last
week. We outshot them 19-9, but we could-
n’t get the job done,” Luxbacher said.

After concluding their Big East sched-
ule, the Panthers still had two games this
week to progress toward their season goal of
10 wins.

Pitt started this quest at Duquesne last
Wednesday with a 3-1 win.

Reagan Bender, Kevin Armour and
Brian Marich scored the Panther goals in the
victory. Senior Jason Piombino had the lone
Panther assist. Senior goalkeeper Chris
Hanlon made three saves for the visiting
Panthers, as his offense registered seven
shots.

Pitt went up 2-0 just 20 minutes into the
game on Armour and Bender’s goals before
Duquesne answered with its lone score of
the contest three minutes later. Marich gave

the Panthers the two—goal cushion back only

1203 later.

Saturday, Pitt hosted the Cleveland
State Vikings H and came away with a
thrilling 1-0 win.

The Panthers dominated most of the
game but had nothing to show for it. They
kept the ball in the Vikings’ end and pep-
pered their goalie with shots in the first half
but could not score. Panther keeper Chris
Hanlon had a great defense in front of him,
as he faced no shots in the first half.

“We dominated them whole game but
did not make the most of our time of pos-
session,” Luxbacher said.

Late in the second half, the Panthers
made a break down the left side and made
three great passes in front of the net before
senior Matt Gray blasted a shot inside the
left post to give the Panthers _a 1-0 lead.

Senior Phil Matilla dominated much of
the game for the Panthers. He was around
the ball all afternoon and set up some great
scoring opportunities early in the second
half.

“Phil was solid all year. He battled
through some injuries and had a great year,”
Luxbacher said. --

This win raised Pitt to 9-5-4 on the sea-
son, to complement its 3-5-3 conference
record. The shutout gave Hanlon his. sixth of
the season.

The Panthers look to reach their goal of
10 victories as they face California
University of Pennsylvania at home on
Tuesday in their last contest of the season.

When it rains, it ours for the Panthers

Schulters banged up in Boston; Angel, Don officially leave squad

Rachel Lenzi

Staff Writer

Saturday afternoon in Boston
started out with a few stray show-
ers and crosswinds, but developed
into stormy skies and driving gale
winds.

And that wasn’t just the
weather. -

In a 22-21 loss to the Golden
Eagles that took place in the n1id-
dle of a Mother Nature temper
tantrum, the Panthers’ forttmes
were waterlogged as well. Before
the contest, the team received
even more bad news, as two play-
ers left the squad.

When it rains, it  well,
everyone knows how that goes.

First, the Panthers took a 21-
14 lead into the fourth quarter and
couldn’t hold the Eagles in the last
two minutes of the game.

Second, the Panthers’ come-
back attempt fell short, and the
team watched the chance at a
bowl game bid slip away.

Third, to add injury to insult,
go-to man Dwayne Schulters got
hurt at the most crucial point of the
game, which ended any chance
that Pitt had for a comeback late in
the fourth quarter.

Even the little things were
stacked against the Panthers-. Early
in the game, center Andrew
Grischow pointed out to the refer-
ee that, of all things, Pitt was using
the wrong ball. The mistake was
corrected.

Also, the departures of Cheo
Angel and Djerns Don, which
were made oﬁicial in the days
before the contest, added to the
woes of an already shaken Panther
depth chart.

Andy Molinaro saw action at
receiver in place of Angel. Ben
Kopp played at tight end for the
injured Kirk McMullen, while
Billy West, whose role has signif-
icantly diminished at tailback,
found himself playing at fullback.

Grant Coﬁield, making his
second appearance as kickoff
man, battled Boston’s gale winds,
which didn’t help the Panthers’
traditionally weak kicking game.

‘That wind was treacherous,”
said Head Coach Walt Harris after
the game. “It shouldn’t reﬂect on
our kicking game, although we’ve
had trouble with the kicking
game.”

According to Harris, the loss
can’t be pinned solely on the kick-

ing game, which has been chided
since miscues in the Temple
game. There are other reasons
why the Panthers dropped the
contest, such as the team’s inepti-
tude in capitalizing in the red
zone. The Panthers were within 25
yards of the end zone four times
and couldn’t put the ball in the
paint.

“We gotta capitalize in the
zone,” said Coach Harris. “When
you get all the way down there,
you gotta do something.”

Schulters put on another mag-
niﬁcent performance — racking
up 193 yards and one touchdown
before sustaining the injury — and
losing the running back late in the
fourth quarter wiped out the
Panthers, who ﬁnally succumbed
to the Eagles’ comeback with less
than two minutes left in the game.

After John Matich kicked the
go-ahead ﬁeld goal to make the
game 22-21, the Pitt faithful
received another jolt, as the
Alumni Stadium scoreboard oper-
ator fumbled on the numbers
when posting the score. For a few
brief seconds the lights read 21-
21, but would then be corrected,
despite the wishes of Panther fans.

didn’t go our way.”

The chance Harris was
speaking of was a hook—and—go
pattern that had Hoffart open for
a touchdown on the play on
which Gonzalez fumbled. The
Eagles blitzed a safety, leaving
one-on-one coverage on Hoffart.
Gonzalez pumped and Hoffart
stopped, then turned and shot
downﬁeld. Just as Gonzalez was
about to throw, the BC blindside
pressure knocked the ball loose.

“It was a shame, because we
had been setting that play up all
game,” said Harris.

It was a numbing loss that
rubbed out a spectacular perfor-
mance by Dwayne Schulters.
Schulters rushed for 193 yards on
33 carries, 109 yards of which
came before the first quarter
ended. Acting as a pinball with
nowhere to go on many plays, the
5-foot-7, 180-pound senior bul-
lied and busted his way through
the Eagles’ defense.

The scatback was a couple of
shoestring tackles away from
breaking a long touchdown I'UIl in
Pitt’s game opening drive. After
an Andy Molinaro 5-yard, ﬁrst-
down catch moved the ball to
BC’s 33-yard line, Schulters ran
the ball on four consecutive

FROM PAGE 10

plays. His ﬁnal carry of the 65-
yard, nine-play drive was a toss
sweep left for a 2—yard touch-
down. Chris Ferencik chipped the
extra point through for a 7-0 lead.

BC mustered just one ﬁrst

down in its opening stint and then
punted away to Pitt, who returned
the favor seven plays later. On the
Pitt’s next possession, an equal
mix of passing to Hoffart and
running by Schulters spearhead-
ed an 81-yard, 10-play touch-
down drive, capped oﬁ” by Billy
West’s ﬁrst touchdown of the sea-
son.
 On their ﬁrst two trips into
enemy territory, the Panthers
 After punting on their
next possession, they scored
again, this time on a you-had-to-
see-it-to-believe-it catch by
Hoffart in the back of the end
zone.

But on their next tries, they:

- hiked a wild snap over
holder Joe Holland’s head on a
ﬁeld-goal try.

- threw an interception.

- punted.

- couldn’t convert a fourth
down.

- lost a ﬁimble to end the
game.

“We have to capitalize in the
zone. When you get all the way
down there, you have to do some-
thing,” said Harris.

Upperclassmen like Cummings realize
