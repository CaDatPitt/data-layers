 

Selections Railroaded

Through IF Meeting

By GENE WEINSTEIN
. _ Staﬂ" Reporter
Charges that the Interfraternity Slate was drawn up by

‘a minority faction at least a week before it was voted on

by IF Council were leveled Monday night by retiring Stu-
dent Congressman Herman Levy.

Levy claimed that seniors Don Ewart and Earl Jacob
met with the formerpresident of IF Council, 1949-50, to
draw up a slate which passed almost completely at the regular

slate meeting last Sunday.

», Both Ewart and the ex-IF head, an alumnus, denied
the accusations. » Ewart labeled it “strictly a rumor.” Jacob

had no comment.

What’s What

Levy complained that “merit was entirely overlooked

in many cases in placing men on the slate.”
“The slate should be based onO~———-——

merit-—not on the wishes of indi-
viduals who won’t be here next

V - year.”

VOTERS NEED ID

To vote students will need
either ID Cards of valid,
stamped class schedule cards.
They will be checked at all
polling stations.

The charge evoked a controver-
sy that kept campus political lights
and Pitt News reporters up Mon-
day night and most of Tuesday

 morning trying totweed conjecture

from fact.

Three questions, yet to be con-
clusively answered, pose the key

“ O to the entire problem. They are:

1. Is it true that the Slate
was in effect pre-deter-
mined?

2. If it is true, then that in-

' dividuals or groups dom-
inated the selections?

3. What will be the political
repercussions of the move?

Next Year At Stake

A This much does seem clear. The

bitter ﬁght over IF slate was in

‘reality a struggle for power in

next year’s Student Congress be-
tween backers of Bill McKinley,
the present vice president and a
junior, and supporters of Cyril
Wecht, incumbent, and also a jun-
ior and a candidate for reelection
to Congress.

Because in past years selection
to’ the slate has been almost equiv-

 alent to election, the forces con-

trolling who is to be, on the slate
can usually call their own tune in
the selection of next year’s Con-
gress officers.

The “fact” that a premature
slate was drawn up was virtu-
ally admitted by all leaders
contacted. It was another
thing, however, to pin down
the responsibility on any per-
sons or groups.

Surprising most observers was

A the disclosure that the former IF

kingpin had supported Joe Ed-

9 . mundson of Delta Tau Delta in his

successful ﬁght against Wecht for
next year’s IF leadership, and now
is apparently backing Wecht in his
struggle against Delt Bill McKin-
ley for the Congress presidency.
As of Tuesday afternoon these

Candidates   and Slates L

He continued,

 

developments were taking place:

1. A new political group, com-
posed of frat men for the most
part, have entered the election
fray in opposition to the IF slate.
The group has called for defeat of
“the minority faction” which it
claims ran IF this year.

2. The regular IF slate is run-
ning under the name of the “All
Campus Party.”

3. Fraternities “left out” by the
recent slating are jockeying for
position in the newly created po-
litical arena.

4. Charges and counter-charges
are being hurled back and forth
between the contending groups.

Fred Purdy, a former Delt and
now a graduate student, told the
News yesterday that “the ex-IF
head told me that there would be
no Delts on the slate with the pos-
sible exception of Dan Purdy, my
younger brother.”

Frat Leaders Voice Opinion

Meanwhile, Dan declared that
the same ﬁgure had told him that
he thought “the slate should be
picked on the basis of fraternities
rather than ability or merit.”

Bill Sullivan, candidate for

Congress, offered further sup-

port for Levy’s contention of

the pre-slate slating. Said Sul-

livan, “On Monday, almost a

week before the slate meeting,

I saw a list with the tentative

slating. With a few exceptions,

it passed the IF meeting the

next Sunday.”

At the slate meeting itself, pres-
ident Jim Morton of IF spoke
strongly against having a slate at
all, since the absence of indepen-
dents in the race, he maintained,
eradicated the need for it.

Pi Kappa Alpha’s Bob Gardner
focused a different light on the
“scandal.” Said Gardner, “Four-
teen fraternities were represented
on the IF “All Campus Party,” and
three more did not petition any
men, while the remaining three
entered only one man each. The
slating was a representative one."

one of America’: GREAT Siuclenl Newspapers

Vol. 44—No. 38

THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH WED., APRIL 18, 1951

Don’t vote today!

We repeat—-don’t vote today!

No-—don’t bother; it’s no use!

Don’t route yourselves out of the Tuck
Shop. ,

Don’t worry about who might be elected.
Don’t worry about IF Council domination.
Don’t kid yourself—we can get along

without your votes. ,

All this surprising? It’s really not, for
that’s how things have been going for many
a year now. Let’s look back to April 19,
1949 when the Pitt News editor wrote:

“It has been an open secret for a number
of years that the fraternities were the own-
ers and operators of the male portion of Stu-
dent Congress . . .”

It looks like things won’t change this

year. '

Or take a look at the News editorial last
year right before election day:

“. . . IF Council can feel virtually cock-
sure of a complete victory this year.”

Sounds familiar‘? Maybe t_hat’s because IF
Council can feel virtually cock-sure of a com-
plete victory thislyear, too. They can feel

Don't Vote Today

that way in spite of last-minute splits in
fraternity solidarity, in spite of disorganized
efforts of non-IF men to buck the slate.

They can feel that way because you are’

sitting somewhere reading this editorial in-
stead of Voting at the polls. They are reason-
ably sure you won’t vote today. They are
probably right.

Dow_n at the bottom of this page is a
complete list of all the men and women run-
ning for office today. Take a look. Pick out
the names" you know. Vote for them. It’s
as simple~as that.

IF Council may win-—on the other hand,
they may not. It really doesn’t matter. It’s
the men that count; don’t worry about who
is backing them.

It looks like State Hall and Alumni Hall
will be the center of election interest this
year. At least up on the Hill they’re doing
a bit of campaigning, working ‘up a bit of
interest. .

At the Cathedral, the actual ‘center’ of
the school, election is a dead word—it’s passe.

So‘ if the politicians are afraid to raise a.

little rumpus, it’s up to you.

Present Race One

By LEN BAKER.
Staff Reporter

The “fighting spirit,” prevalent in past campus elections,
has so far been absent from the present race. Only two in-
dependents have tossed their hats into the ring.

The elections in 1948 to 1950 were marked by $20 ﬁnes,

hijacking of Pitt News, and other‘

“Tippecanoe and Tyler, too” ac-
tivities.
Independents were active as an

organization from Student Con-

gress’ beginning in 1945 on
through 1948. In that year IF was
rocked on its heels when Ed Za-
dorozny beat the slate-candidate

Runs as Independent

Sam Shapiro, candidate for a senior Student Congress
seat, has reaffirmed his aim of running a one-man campaign.
He is the petitioner who has refused to ally himself

with either IF Council (as a

fraternity man) or with any’

other political gnachine. He was
also asked to join the party of
Gene Cowie, Bill Sullivan, James
Burchﬁeld, and Don Milletary but
declined. up

No ‘Political’ Entanglements

Said Shapiro, “My sentiments
are with Don Milletany and his
party but I still want to stay free
of any political entanglements”.
He is running under a slogan of
“Merit is the key word.”

Shortages of Voting Machines

Zadorozny, a frat man himself,
garnered a large number of votes
from Ellsworth Center and the
YMCA. Voting was light with
many complaints being levied
about the location of the voting
machines being.changed at the
last minute and about the short-
age of machines.

The real action came in the next
year, 1949. Independent opposition
began to worry the frat men when
Stuart Workmaster organized a
coalition between the School of
Engineering and Mines, Ellsworth
Center, and other organizations.

IF resorted to placing a $20 ﬁne
on each fraternity which might

out IF support.

When rumors circulated that the
Pitt News had obtained the IF
slate and was going to release it,
some roving bands of frat men
attempted to hijack the News.
Only a few copies were pilfered.

Independents Crack Slate

The fracas resulted in the inde-
pendent slate winning two posi-
tions with Lou Cecconni, football
star of the time, and Bob Mc-
Kowen taking senior positions in
Congress.

Cecconni had the highest num-
ber of votes a student legislator
ever received at Pitt.

Delayed
For Tests

Draft-age students’ hopes were
raised by Gen. Lewis B. Hershey’s
report Sunday that no men would
be drafted until their test scores
aiid scholastic standing were de-
termined.

The selective service director's
latest statement allayed the fears
voiced by many draft eligible stu-
dents that they might be drafted
at the end of the spring semester
under the present deferment law,
before they could take the nation-
wide test or before their spring
grades could be determined.

The test dates, May '26, June 16,
and June 30, fall later than the end
of many college terms, and atl
present college men are deferred
only until the end of this school
year. .

Students who score 70 or above,
according to Hershey, or rank high
in their class will not be drafted
unrti»l the score and standing,
reaches the local draft board,
where both will be considered in

determining deferment for next:

year. 3
No applicant may take the test
without a Ticket of Admission
from the Princeton Educational
Testing Service. Students must re-
port to the testing center on the
data indicated on the ticket of
aduxission, and may not enter the
center later than 8:30 a. m.

When reporting for the test, the
bulletin says, students must bring
with them an official document
showing their selective service
numbers and the exact designa-
tion, number, and address of the
Slective Service Local Board hav-
ing‘ jurisdiction over them.

LUCKIES TASTE BETTER
THAN ANY OTHER CIGARETTE !

Fine tobacco—and only ﬁne tobacco-—can

give you the perfect mildness and rich taste
that make a cigarette completely enjoyable.
And Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco. So if
you’re not happy with your present brand
(and a 3 8-city survey shows that millions are

General Douglas MacArthur’s recent dismissal recalls
an address he made to Pitt’s graduating class of 1932. His
- speech, which then, seemed to be only a prophecy, has in

current years become a reality.
0

When he visited our campus,
MacArthur was chief-of-staff of
the army under President Hoover.
At that time, he opposed the idea
of the pacifists who believed that
war and military force were no
means of obtaining peace.

Pacificisrn No Cure

The general stated that paciﬁc
habits insure neither reace nor
immunity from national insult and
aggression.

“Any nation that would pre-‘

Americans Brutal ?
“. . . Yet to judge by the frantic

tions to disarm us one would fancy
that Americans were the most

brutal and belligerent people in the
world,” he said.

In his address, MacArthur also;

< urged that we get rid of provincial i

attitudes and do some hard think-
ing to combat sentimental cru-

OVERSET . . .

‘A Biological Necessity‘

non THOM?

“Gambling is a biological necessity!” -

That, at least, is what St. Louis’ boss bookie man, James
J. Carroll told Senator Kefauver recently. '

We wish we could ask‘Carroll, why he used such old-
fashioned terminology."He could at least have dressed his

observation up a bit, redecorated¢

and modernized it, and delivered
it as a highly—respectable “psycho-
logical compulsion.”

Quiz-Bingo Compulsion

Maybe that would explain the
following little story that was bur-
ied on the back pages of the news-
papers a few days ago.

It was to the effect that an or-

ganization had found a way to get.

around‘ the bingo ban in Dayton,
Ohio. To do this, the group merely
combined it with a quiz game.

At the ﬁrst “quiz-bingo” session
no police showed up. Asked why,
theysaid they couldn’t stop the
game.

No admission was charged and
cash prizes were -awarded to the
players who scored a “bingo” and
answered one question such as:

“What is the home town of the
Cleveland Indians?”

“What is the first name of Joe
E. Brown?”

We might add—“What was the

name of the man who said he
could legislate gambling out o
existence?”

MacArthur's Buddy. McCarthy

In the backwash of the Truman-
MacArthur head—butting session,
there has been a lot of loud and
irresponsible talk. Not the least
(and usually the ﬁrst) of the of-
fenders was Senator Joseph Mc-
Carthy who opened his mouth at
a recent dinner long enough to
deliver his “bourbon and benedic-
tine” blast at President Truman.
We think 100 per cent proof might
work a lot better for the gentle-
man from Wisconsin instead of his
present brand of 100 proof vitriol.

The Truman-MacArthur fracas
hit hard here at Pitt, too. In one
of Mrs. Ruth Lutz’s Wednesday
morning political science classes
the argument evolved into a real
knock - em - down—if-you-can de-
bate. One young fellow worked

Aboish Student Government

Every year about this time the Pitt News devotes a con-
siderable percentage of its news space to covering student
elections. A stranger reading an election-day edition of the
News would, no doubt, concludethat student government is a

0

big thing around here.

Our hypothetical stranger would
be wrong. Student government is
not now, nor has it ever been, im-
portant. Under the present setup,
it never will be important. Its
insigniﬁcance in the scheme of
things is not the fault of our poli-

ticians.

The real blame can be traced to
the Founding Fathers who held
that government of the students,
by the students and for the stu-
dents was incompatible with the
sane administration of a large uni-
versity. They held further that
given an inch the populace would

serve its tranquility, its rights, its Vi Sade”-

independence, its self-respect, andl

The Campus reports:

“President Truman’s order de-
ferring college students with good
grades and high IQ’s wasn’t an
unqualiﬁed success here.

“One student picked up a news-
paper, read the story about the
new order, and then threw down
the paper with an air of disgust.

He snorted, “Damn, after all'the
trouble I went through to get in
ROTC.”

Coeds Have Draft Jitters

A survey at the University of
Detroit showed coeds were arous-
ed over the draft question, and
how it might effect their own lives
in the event of total mobilization.

According to the Varsity News,
sophomore Margo Lanphear felt:

“In the event of -total mobiliza-

“Since women like to be pur-
sued, the majority would rather be
drafted than enlist so that they
may keep their self-esteem. In

ed so drafting them would be
more practical and efficient any-
way.”

she answered, “someone has to
keep the men company.”

to ﬁeld a strong team against theO

A member of the Munhall
Borough Council told the Pitt
News yesterday that Munhall’s

use of spacious West Field in
Munhall for a night game
with Notre Dame on either
April 27 or 28.

said, “The next move is up to
‘Tom Hamilton.”

Hamilton, however, could
_ not be reached for comment
 as this edition of the News

went to press.

If the game at West Field
goes through, it will be Pitt’s
ﬁrst night. baseball game. West
Field is considered by many
as the best playing ﬁeld in
Western Pennsylvania. Last
year, Duquesne Played a night

-If any student sees any Pitt
football player of the last 15 years,
tell them to contact Boldin at the

Practice Problems

Mike also forsees practice trou-

“Practice is going to be a prob-
lem,” Mike admits. “We’ll try to
have the boys who are going to
do most of the playing out for
about a week’s practice before
the game.”

The old-timers will use the
single wing, because as Mike
explains it, “Most of our play-

cigarette mildness can’t be determined by a cursory sniff or a single, quickly-

Asking the Man Who Knows

Two MC Men
Quit; Two Try

For Congress

Two of the six members of
Men’s Council, re-elected inter-
nally for next year, have resigned.

Of the same six men, two more
announced their intentions of run-
ning for positions on Student Con-
gress.

Ralph Thorne, present secretary
of Council, and Vic Kasmierski
are the two members resigning.
Kasmierski has been re—appointed
to the position of business manager

of The Panther and believes he

cannot do justice to both ofﬁces.

Jack Burwinkle and Don Mille-
tary have ﬁled petitions for Stu-
dent Congress and have been nom-
inated for election. If they are
elected they will have to resign
their positions on MC. If such is
the case, there will be 18 new faces
in Men’s Council next year.

As it stands at the time, the
only sure members for next year
are the two remaining men of the
six re-elected. They are Ronald
Ecker and Charles Wendell. These
two men, and possibly Burwinkle
and Milletary, will form the nu-
cleus of next year’s Men’s Council.

Fine Arts Dean to Speak

College of Fine Arts, Seoul Uni-
versity, Korea, will speak to the
Fine Arts Society April 19 at 8
p.m. on the 7th floor. His subject
willbe the Grotto Sculptures at
the Cave Temple near Kyung-ju
in Korea. Non—members are invit-
ed to attend.

BEAVERS GET TIPS FROM EXPERT. Charles Vaughan, Ken

Oath Bill
May Miss
Pitt Profs

The hotly disputed “Oath bill”
may not affect the University fac-
ulty, after all.

The sponsor of the bill, Repre-
sentative Albert R. Pechan, has
revealed that a plan to strike out
the provision requiring the oath
from teachers in state supported
institutions is now being consid-
ered by legal experts in the State
Justice Department.

The bill passed the Senate by a
42-7 vote over vigorous Demo-
cratic protests. Opponents of the
bill are pressing now for public
hearings before the House.

Thus far, 171 of the Pitt fac-
ulty have signed a petiion pro-
testing the bill. It will be sent to
Harrisburg.
