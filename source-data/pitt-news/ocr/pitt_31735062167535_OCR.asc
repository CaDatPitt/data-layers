It was 8:30 Monday morning and as a tad-
pole-like helicopter crossed paths with a bird in
flight, two columns of people inched their way
down Center Ave. hill away from the Civic Arena
toward the nucleus of downtown Pittsburgh.

One group, uniformed in blue, 20 in num-
ber, stayed close to the sidewalk, riding slowly
and noisily on motorcycles bearing the label
Pittsburgh Police Department. White crash hel-
mets rested on their heads and revolvers were
laced to their hips.

The other group was completely disuniform.
Young men on crutches hobbled down the street;
grandmothers held onto the hands of their grand-
children; blacks and whites marched together,’
four abreast. They were there for Black Monday-,
to support the Black Construction Coalition’s at-
tempt to penetrate the unions and procure jobs
for blacks.

Room

Robbery
Thwarted

by BOB GING and BOB BONN
Staff Writers

Sgt. Bartholomew of the cam-
pus police force declined com-
ment on an attempted robbery
which took place in the Hunt Room
Monday night at 10 p.m.

According to witnesses, two
blacks had hidden behind some
lockers before the new, tight se-
curity check went into effect at
6:30 p.m. They waited there until
the waitress on duty collected the
day’s income and prepared to
leave.

They then attempted the rob--
bery. They were interrupted, how-
ever, by Officer Delaney of the
campus police, who reportedly
had gone down for a cup of coffee.

One of the burglars grabbed De-
laney’s gun and both bolted for the
Forbes Ave. exit. They were stop-
ped there by Officer Netz, also of
the campus police, who scuffled
with them and retrieved Delaney’s
gun.

Netz apprehended one of the
robbers, but the other escaped.
The suspect was taken to Pitts-
burgh Police Station No. 4 and

A . booked.

Sgt. Bartholomew declined com-
ment to reporters as neither he
nor the officers on duty were au-
thorized to make any press state-
ments. An official statement from
Captain Ray of the Security De-
partment is expected shortly.

were termed serious. One student
was detained overnight and two
were asked to return for further -
treatment the following day.

According to Lieutenant Mer-
ritt of campus security, students
were stopped by bands of youths
on the streetssurrounding the
University. Demands were made
for money. If the students showed
any verbal or physical attempts to
defend themselves, they were as-
saulted.

Two arrests were made by city
police, but they were not as a re-
sult of the assault and battery
charges. Two youths from the Ali-
quippa area were arrested. The
youths were stopped for a traffic
violation at the corner of Fifth
Ave. and Bouquet St.; they were
screaming obscenities at persons

A passing on the street. Upon stop-

ping them, police found guns and
chains in their possession.

An open air dance at Carlow
College was disrupted whenf50 or
60 youths overtook the bandstand.
The dance was dismissed and city
police were called. Most of the
assaults occurred in the Carlow
area during the congestion follow-
ing the dismissal of the dance and
the end of a baseball game.

A student was assaulted in the'
corridor leading from the Su to the
Quad after the BAS social held in
the SU. Police were busy clearing
the building and did not witness
the incident.

Some trouble was also reported l
in the SU pool room when a youth
was refused usage of the pool fa-
cilities because he did not have an i
ID card.

Lt. Merritt asserted that secur- l

the streets surrounding the Uni-
versity, but he did not say if they
would be University or city offi-
cials.

Special security precautions
were taken in the Towers area.
All doors to the Towers were lock-

ed ‘except the main Fifth and

Forbes Ave. entrances. Only'stu-
dents and their guests, faculty,
and staff were admitted to the
Towers lobby.

According to John Vrana, direc-
tor of University housing, these
security measures will continue
during week-ends. In a meeting
held yesterday with the Housing
Advisory Board, Vrana planned to
review the incidents of last Friday
and to make suggestions for fur-
ther measures. A formal state-
ment will be made pending the“
outcome of the meeting. Letters
will be sent to all resident stu-
dents explaining any new secur-
ity procedures.

In the interim, Vrana has stat-
ed that “it is vitally important
that the security of resident stu-
protected. Security

they will continue until further de-
velopments.”

UC CORRECTION

Monday’s issue of the Pitt
News contained an error in
the front page story about
the action of the Undergrad-
uate Council. '

In the story, it was noted
that no rule that said lan-
guage courses must be tak-
en consecutively existed,
and that students do not
have to take language
courses in consecutive
terms.

According to the Dean of
the College’s office, this
was misinterpreted by
members of the Council dur-
ing the meeting, and such a
rule /does exist.

The Dean’s office did
note, however, that in cases
of extreme hardship, stu-
dents may be allowed to be
exempted from this rule, as
from other rules in the Col-
lege.

~\_ 'Three Into Two’

Quality Performers Wanted 011 Film

by DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

My initial response after viewing Three
Into Two Won’t G0 was to scream, “Say it
ain’t so, Rod,” for nothing, not even the act-
ing of Mr. Steiger and Claire Bloom could-
save this movie from being one of the most
dated, poorly written, miscast bits of cellu-
loid ever to sneak onto the screen.

This is your basic eternal triangle film
‘-_V with the former Mr. and Mrs. Steiger play-
" ing husband and wife," while Judy Geeson
fills in the other side as a nubile nymphet
who delights in flaunting her sexual free-
dom in front of the semi-hung-up Steiger.

Rod sells refrigerators (quite a come- .

down for an Oscar-winning red—neck sher-
iff) and delights in picking up young girls
who hitchhike along the English country-
side. He had one major acting problem: not
being able to decide whether to use an Eng-
lish accent, Scottish accent, Irish accent,
or German accent. He diplomatically solv-
ed the problem by using allfour, making
him sound like Richard Burton imitating

Kurt Jurgens hunting for the Loch Ness
monster in the Irish Sea.

Aside from accent problems, Steiger

' should know better than to portray a refri-

gerator salesman with the vigor of Al Ca-
pone; he just couldn’t seem to refrain from
lapsing into those Steigerian soliloquies
that are becoming a bit tedious. Brilliant
in other movies, the usual Steiger drunk
scene turned into camp embarrassment
that was not helped by an horrendous make-
up job that made a cut on the lip look more
like a lost beauty mark.

Predictably, Miss Bloom played the
frigid wife who couldn’t go along with Rod’s
idea of fun, namely screwing on the living
room couch. She paints the house white to
symbolize her frigidity (get it’), visits her
mother in an old age home (oh, is her moth-
er bad), and tells Rod she never enjoyed
sex with him, even in the beginning (what a
heavy line! ).

Thankfully, Miss Geeson stole the show,
akin to stealing week-old garbage, with a

‘performance that included enough body ex-

posure to let everyone know she is beauti-
fully built and tremendously sexy, with the
most inviting pair of lips you or Rod Steig-
er will ever see. She even has the habit of
grading all the studs who pick her up. Rod
receives an A——. Isn’t that cute. See how
un-hung-up all us young people are about
sex. Sheeit! ‘ '

After Rod sleeps with her for the sec-
ond time, she decides to go over to his
house and finish off the unhappy marriage.
She tells Claire she’s pregnant; she tells
Rod he made her pregnant; Rod tells
Claire; Ciaire tells Judy; Judy tells Rod.
This movie is a real stinker!

But no matter how bad the movie is,
everything must take a back seat to the
non-acting of Peggy Ashcroft who played
Miss Bloom’s mother." Her performance
was so atrocious that I could not convince
anyone in the theatre she was attempting
to be serious; you could almost see the on-
ion when she cried, and I swore I heard one
of the cameramen laughing. To put it suc-
cinctly, Peggy Ashcroft acted with all the
emotional vigor of a polluted‘ river.

rgiﬂeﬂections

 N0 S0 ion ,

by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, The Pitt News

In trying to bridge the security gap during the past few days,

-. — many interesting (actually discouraginglthoughts have passed
through my mind. ~-

, . ' - First, Ifeel the business of closing the Union to those outside
I the University community, namely non-students from the local
' area, is only going to come back in the future to cause more prob-

lems than it will solve.

The physical damage to students is being done in the streets,
not in the Union. If some kind of a community spirit were to be

' _ fostered, then the trouble on the streets would be minimized. This

community spirit will never begin with locked doors separating

 one groupiof thecommunity from the other. It could lead to .the
. ’ formation of an academic-ghetto that would be much more dang-
‘ erous to all concerned than theblack or white ghettos of Western"

Pennsylvania.

. As far as the dorms are concerned, the residents should de-
termine their own rules. If they decide that,,they want locks and

I ' keys, it is their dorm and they should run them. But the Union is
a different story. ‘

In discussing the security problem with Captain Ray, chief of
securityipolice, Bernie'Kobosky, Vice Chancellor for Student Af-

  _ fairs, and John Loch, director of the Union, it was evident’ that

they were in a position which called for some emergency meas-
ures to be taken.

But it was in discussing these measures that-the most press- ,
ing problem at this University was brought to light. There are

. simply not enough competent people to, handle the problems of a
‘ large, urban University. There are not enough funds to run a

quality University. There is not enough true concern for a first-
rate University by those people on the payroll whose job it is to
solve problems.

This problem exists because there are so many people going
to the University, it can barely function. Administrators are kept
busywith the day-to-day problems, and have no time to look to the
future to see what long-range. effects their decisions will have.
With all their luncheons, committees, meetings, dinners, now
even breakfast meetings at the Chancellor’s house, it is evident
that either more administrators are needed——or else better ones.

For example, it is going to take Mr. Kobosky, who seems
very dedicated to solving as many of the problems Jack Critch-

I  field left behind as possible, months before he gets settled in his
new job. By that time, thedecisions he must make in the mean-

time could be more harmful than constructive. He may never get
to prove himself, for he doesn’t seem the type who will just ac-

--  V cept the pat answer so many ‘others here accept, “There just
« V aren’t any funds.” ' .

But it is quite obvious that others, for example-Captain Ray,

’ are quite content to let problems go unsolved for ‘‘lack of funds.”
 In the past two weeks, it'ha‘s become obvious that the security
‘force is underpaid, overworked, uncertain of their exact duties,
and fearful of the questionable hiring andfiring policy. Many of
'* the cops are either retired workers from other jobs or part-time
' ;.employees. This is not to say that they haven’t, as a rule, done the
A ":best job possible considering the situation in which they must

work. It is. to say that the situation should have been improved

— , long ago.

I

’  it wasn't, and now—Mr. Kobosky and Mr. Loch are faced j

 ’ with a difficult problem. They seem to be very open to students’
' Ksuggestions for solving the problem. Not just the problem at hand
 ‘-of offering maximum bodily security to all students, but the even’
,_ .* greater problem of long-term community relations. But neither.
A A man has the time, the staff, the money, nor the authority to re-
 search. this long-range problem. The Chancellor has offered his
" usual verbal commitment’. to see that somethingis done,‘ and
funds are supposedly being made available for the security force.
x;But, why wasn't this done during the summer, when incidents of

physical harm showed that the campus was.unsafe?

1: Was the problem overlooked by the Chancellor, Captain Ray,-

, and others because reports showed whites were beating up Uni-
-*versity students?’ Or has ‘Mr. Koboskyfiwho has spent his last
:two weekends talking to students, parents, BAS leaders. local
 highgschool officials, and others, been the impetus to improved
 security since he accepted his job a month ago‘?

 ‘Many people here are obviously not doing their job. They are

‘lscared; they are acting and reactin with little orno foresight.

Cap t. Ray Discusses

Security

In the past two weeks, the number of in-
cidents around the University which have en-
dangered the safety of the students have reach-
ed major proportions. Rape, 'muggings and
other acts of violence directed toward the stu-
dents are no longer isolated, and are rapidly
becoming a commonplace occurrence.

One of the solutions offered to help solve
the problem has been the new policy devised
by John Loch, director of the Pitt Student Union.
This policy denies access to the_Student»Union
after 6:30 p.m., to any person not carrying a
valid University ID. i -

Hereafter, only members of the Univer-
sity Community and their guests will be per-
mitted to use the Schenley H-all facilities.

In an interview with Pitt News reporters,‘ ‘

Captain Charles Ray, Superintendent of the
University Security. Force, explained the ra-
tionale behind this tight security check. '

The ‘great deal of trouble has been the re-

sult of so many non—University"people, drawn '

to the campus for activities in the facilities. By

shutting down the University to_ outsiders,_,.._
Capt. Ray hopes to elimin_a,,t__e the" influence ‘

of personnanon grata.   ..

Ray hopes to intensﬁyand upgrade the‘ 3

force to a point where the ’-streets‘ and build— _
ings adjacent to the University willonce again
be safe for students. In the very‘ near future,
he hopes to beef up the understaffed unit,
now comprised of about fifty officers.

Cooperation with the Pittsburgh Police is

4 being explored, and the Chancellor has author-

ized necessary additional precautions. ‘

' Security in the Student Union has already ’
presented_as many problems as solutions. Many _

students have not yet received their invoices
and therefore do not havegvalidated ID cards;

Chancellor’siStatemeI1tA_;

I ‘am deeply disturbed about the-events of

last Friday evening when a number of "Univer-

sity students were assaulted in and around the
campus following social events both here and
at Carlow College. I am concerned primarily
for the safety ‘of all our students. I also am con-

cerned that the nature of the _events, and their ’
‘ causes, might be misunderstood by "some, and

that this could aggravate tensions.

Therefore, there are several points I'would
like to make clear; - ' "

These assaults in all reported cases were
made bv groups of teen-agers not connected

with the University of Pittsburgh. To ourknow-

ledge, no University of Pittsburgh students "
were guilty of participating inassaults on other

Pitt students. Although an augmented Univer-
sity security force was on duty last {Friday

nigh_t,_and citypolicemen from the Oakland

Station were called, the sporadic and dispers-
. .ed_ nature of the assaults“rn'ad_e it difficult to
protect students with the _f,orces.av"a'i_lable.. '

It is important to 'riepo‘rt that the Black Ac-

tion‘ Society, ‘prior to last Friday, expressed .

its constructive concern -in a number of ways,
including working closely with the .Un_i_versi-
ty’s student affairs staff and by appointing

marshalls who were effective so that there no *

incidents during the e‘v'ening’\_s. event. I ' '

As to the. future, the University is taking ‘

A foreign exchange student who had just en-
tered the University and had notyet received
his ID was also turned away. Many other stu-
-dents, presenting meal tickets, dormitory keys",
and other means of‘ identification were de-
nied access to the premises. P ’

Various interviews throughout the evening
showed that this security measure was con-
sidered neither the most convenient, nor the
most result-producing step to take. Students
were dissatisfied, claiming that the trouble was .
not caused inside the buildings, but out on the
street. V —

One University security officer lamented
that the only effect, the increased, intra-build- ._
ing surveillance would have is to drive the
trouble causing element into the street, where
there is no protection. Unfortunately, he com-
mented, it is difficult to get good policemen at
the salary the University "Policemen are paid.
It takes extreme dedication _to work under the
adverse conditions they work under, he con-
tinued, and receive so few benefits in return. '

Another officer stated that it would not be '

f}\,

as difficult on the force if the students them-I ‘ ‘

selves would cooperate, a little more, and

 refrain from the usual harrassrneht directed at
 «the police ; '

/

, ‘Ironically enough, one the first night of the A A

 security step-up, an attempted robbery took _
sq place in the Hunt Room of the Student Un- 

ion. One of the youths who precipitated the
crime was apprehended by the University po-
lice, but his accomplice fled, and as yetfre-
mains unknown. ' '

One o/pinion shared by most of the stu-
dents and police is that some workable solu-

' tion be arrived at very soon, so that they may

  S ACTION, REACTIO

Union Policy Requires "'I.D.”

TO: All Members of the
University Community
g FROM: John R. Loch
 DATE: September 15, 1969

SUBJECT: Admittance Policy-— .
Pitt Student Union

After review by the Union Advisory Com--

mittee, the Union Director’s Office, and the
Assistant Chancellor for Student Affairs of
the incidents surrounding social events held
in the Pitt Student Union on September 12,
1969, it is deemed essentail that additional
steps be taken to insure the safety of mem-
bers of the University community and secur-
ity of University property. The following reg-
ulations govern admittance to the Pitt Stu-
dent Union effective immediately.

1. Access to the Pitt Student Union may be
gained by the main entrances on Forbes
and Fifth Aves. All other entrances to the
Union will be closed.

wi 2. Only University of ' Pittsburgh students,
faculty members, and staff members and
their guests will be permitted in the Pitt
Student Union. '

‘  fairs of September 12, 1969, all mem-

' bersof the.University community will be

Identification Cards must be returned to

view by the Union Advisory Committee,
for reservations for use of Union space to
be granted to non-University groups. It is
the responsibility of sponsoring depart-
ments or organizations to insure that all
participants in their events are aware o
the preceding regulations. '

Each member of the University commun-
ity should insure that he has in his possession
a current Faculty or Staff Identification Card
or a Student Multipurpose Identification Card
and a current Term Validation Certificate.
Cards may be obtained fromthe Officeof the
Registrar in Room G-58 Cathedral of Learn-
ing. V ’ V A _ »

Although this _ policy is effective imme-
diately, members of the University commun-

ity may enter the Union facilities‘: upon pre-_.
sentation of an academic invoice or void Fac- «-

ulty or Staff Identification Card through 6:30

that time, no individualwill be 'admi_tted'un-

The unfortunate incidents of the last two
weeks involving unprovoked attacks on mem-
bers of the University community by non-
members require the University and the Un-
ion to implement these protective measures.
It is anticipated that all members of the Uni-
versity community will assume more respon-

sixility in preventing the occurrence of fu- V

ture incidents.

Security_recommendations were submit- : ‘

ted to the Assistant Chancellor for Student
Affairs by the Union staff on September 9,-
1969, outlining additional measures to- in-
creasesafety and security in the Pitt Student
Union as deemed essential, and where funds
are made available these measures /will be
implemented. ‘ ‘

Contributing Columnist

_I confess a liking for Dustin
Hoffman. I think that any actor
who completes a film like The
Graduate and files for unemploy—
ment compensation the next day,
as Hoffman is reported to have

I I « done, differs fundamentally from

the others before the lens today.

; What’s more, any young actor

bound for the milk and honey land
of a career as a leading man, as
was Hoffman after The Graduate,
who slicks back his hair, neglects
his beard, and blackens his teeth,
as Hoffman has done in Midnight

In — Cowboy, has his ear to a drum far

removed from Hollywood.

, - I The fact remains, however, that
4 this is a confession and not an ad-

mission for the reviewer; the two

' performances of Dustin Hoffman

with which he is familiar have
been lacking. In both films, Hoff-

‘ man’s ills are symptomatic of

problems tarnishing the entire

I "work. Put succinctly, both films

appeal to confused audience pre-
conceptions about psychology in-

‘- stead ‘of patientlyjbuilding scene,

by scene to a’ self-contained
screen reality. As a side effect.
they leave their audiences, with-

-"out sufficient information‘ about
 themotivation which brought their

characters to the situations which
are shown; this makes assessment
of‘ character growth and/or de-

' i 7' cline almost impossible.

. Since humor can support itself
‘on the stereotyped alone, The

' . Graduate, even though its direc-
V tor,'Mike Nicols, contends that it’
- was intended -as a- tragedy, was
‘ met with general acceptance.

Tragedy, however, is distinctive-

mystery for the audience, butfor f

most resolution probably comes
through viewing them as demons-
trative of Joe’s state of mind; he
is confident in his decision to trav-
el, but nothing can keep the per-
sonal landmarks of the town from
triggering memories. Strong'sex-
ual overtones are present, how-
ever, and the audience’s mystery
changes to confusion. Joe’s;recol-
lections of times with Crazy Anne
(a teen-age tart who showed Joe
where it’s at .— literally and fig-
uratively) are. readily understood
(if you don’t buy a copy of Stag at
the terminal you simply make up
your own), but those of aging Aunt
Sally Buck beg for Freudian treat-
ment. '

The motivation for exhibiting
Aunt Sally’s coddling of young Joe‘
is probably the desire to comment
on the influences which have
brought Joe to set out for New
York to offer his matured capabil-
ities to Aunt Sallys willing to pay.
Although this is admirable motiva-
tion, flashbacks. in the form of

character recollection aren't‘ the.

tools to use. Recollection is al-
ways a form of conscious activity,
but events occuring during forma-
tive years which have had subtle
psychological repercussions re-
side‘ in the sub-conscious. Conse-
quently, "Joe’s recollectingof just

such kind of events works only be- '

cause most audiences are more

concerned with the story than the 

esthetics of the film.

If John Schlesinger, Midnight,
Cowboy’s director, had wantedptoe

carry—off what he tried to carry-
off he could have done it by shift-
ing time frame and spending some
footage on Joe Buck's youth. It
wouldn’t even have taken much‘
originality to do what the review-
er has suggested; after all, ‘he got

the idea from the James Leo Her- ~

ily novel on which the film is bas-
ed. i

scenes wherein the camera is sta-

er questions why in Joe’s first
New York score the audience is

shown a television instead of the ' "I

bed (to make it Iaught? should it
laugh?), why when Rico dreams
of Miami, a beautiful scene with
Joe and Rico running down the

xeach—Rico’s deformed leg mir-
aculously cured, thoughts are
turned to Rico’s hustling of Miami
matrons (to juxtapose beauty and
ugliness? What’s the rest of the
film for?), why a beautiful shot of
Rico hobbling behind Joe over a
bridge has to include the insane
grin of Jonathan Winters on a bill-
board (because all is absurd? Ri-
co’s condition to Rico isn't ab-
surdl), and why Rico, obviously
dieing in front of Joe who is psy-
chologically unable to understand
what's happening,‘ has to wet his

, pants? The reviewer’s conclusion,T

as illustrated by the above ques-
tions, is that consistently when-
ever .the pain poignancy of Mid-
night Cowboy enables communi-

’ cation about human association,

the director forces the audience
into an escape; there should be no
escape from art.

a model of techniques for films
like Midnight Cowboy and Samuel

Beckett’s Waiting for Godot and

Endgame as‘ models for charact-
er motivation. My next article will
be on, hopefully, the esthetic re-

lation between: the novels Mid-
’ night Cowboy and 2001 and the

movies of the same name.

DePasqua Prepares For Uclans,
Selects Most Of Starting Line-up

by ED CONLEY
Panther tight end Ray Reppert’s quarterbacking experience

has gained him the control of the “UCLA offense” in the grid’
-practices this week. And, coincidentally, he was wearing the

number of the Bruins’ top signal caller Dennis Dummit, dur-

ing Monday’s session.

VJ

Carl DePasqua’s defensive units
didn’t seem to have a great deal
‘of difficulty against the forma-
tions that Tommy Prothro is ex-
pected to use next Saturday, but
the coach refused to admit satis-
faction.

“It isn’t the formations that

bother me. It’s the people they

JIM FRIEDI.
Still In The Running ‘

(the Bruins)‘ have in the forma-
tions,”ihe noted. “And they are

explosive. You can’t afford to miss

a tackle.” ._

The coach has just about de-
cided on his starting defensive
team for the opener. And it's
a line-up that's should be a com-
fortable blend of sophomores,
juniors, and seniors.

Veterans Paul Naponick and

, Bob Ellis will be responsible for

reducing the pressure on the for-
ward wall as the two endsplay
along side the inexperienced, but
highly touted soph Howard Broad-
head and junior John Stevens.

A similar situation exists in
the secondary with seniors George

Pribish and. Dave Dibbley ‘oc--

cupying thesafety positions, and-
juniors Charlie Hall aildi Mike
Bannan holding onto the corner:
back_posts. ' '

There’s still some competition
in the all-important linebacking
unit. Of course, soph Ralph Cind-
rich has won back the middle
linebacking job that eluded him
because of injury after last fall’s
jaunt ‘to Los Angeles.

Richey, Nolan Missed:
Harriers Unprepared

'For Saturday Opener

by JERRY MYERS

The harriers aren’t ready to ,-open the 1969 cross-country
season at Bowling Green Saturday, but the men of Jim Banner

have no say in the matter.

' “There’s no doubt that we are going inlblind,” said Banner, “but”I

' have a lot of confidence that the
V‘ boys will make a good showing.”
.7 Time has been against us and I

don’t want to push the team too

 _ hard.”
 _ L Missing two veteran runners in
* All-American Jerry Richey and

Mike Nolan, the harriers will go
into Bowling Green meet under-

 ._ manned and inexperienced. Fresh-
ymen will hold down the majority

of starting positions on the squad
while both Richey and Nolan are
recovering from injuries.
Among the more impressive
first year men thus far, however,

. include Dave Szabat, Dave Chese-

borough, Terry McGill, and John
Black and Ken Silay. Freshmen
are eligible for varsity competi-
tion this year due to an NCAA rul-
ing enacted last spring.

Teaming up with the inexperi-

. enced frosh will be juniors Mark

Vornhagen and Greg Rodgers and
sophomore Ken Balkey.

Banner’s harriers leave for

Unegin was hurt last week and has

_been slowed down,” Bemis said.
Bemis intends to make a decision

A between the two after reflecting

on Tuesday’s scrimmage against
Allegheny Community College.

Jerry Kruth is a Junior trans-
fer from Slippery Rock. He'll be
positioned at fullback and half-
back, basically both rely on de-
fensive capability. Last season he
filled in as team manager.

The new co-captains are Lou
Vida and Bob Trexler. Bemis
remarked that both appear to be

If 5' good leaders at this point. “I

 

 can find no fault with them. Trex-
.. _~ler has been a two year regular
 ; and hasn’t missed a practice.

They’re both doing a good job.”

._ -Another important cog in Leo
Bemis’ soccer machine is Randy

: Dry. He had been switched from‘

A .' lineman to fullback before last

year’s West Virginia contest.
Both fullbacks are fugitives from
the offense (the line). Bemis ex-

 plained that he wanted a guy who
1 ,could handle the ball under pres-
" gsure; therefore he’s’taken a com-

petent lineman and changed him

,  “into a defenseman.

 -. “We’ve got more well-rounded

- cer is on an upward plane, every-

 'one’s ‘getting better, “stated

Bemis had hoped to learn more
about his squad after Monday’s
.-scrimmage against Point Park.
[But Bemis remarked, “It wasn’t
[rnuch of a scrimmage. .We get
more of a workout playing the
~‘fre.s,hr_nen against the varsity. It’s

3' l.will_- resemble; '

be very tough,” commented the
coach. “They have two outstand-
ing runners this year.”

Richey led the harriers to vic-
tory last year as he set a new
course record in outdistancing
Bowling Green's Sid Sink by nine
seconds. Sink went on to be the
Mid-American Conference school’s
only representative in the NCAA
finals in 1968. Nolan, meanwhile,
finished sixth in the meet a year
ago.

Richey has been working out
and hopes to do some running for
the harriers this season, but it’ll
be quite sometime before he will
be ready to go full speed. “His
progress report has been good,”
related Banner, “but he’s still
coming around slowly.”

9-0. The Sammies were held to
one hit by Richard Koshgerian, as
the Delts rallied for a five run sec-

Sigma Chi also remained unde-

on a rampage with a four for four
night, collecting two singles and
two home runs. The Sig Chi’s belt-

fourth to grab the lead for good.
Dennis Piper homered for AE Pi,

for Delta Phi.

Pi Kappa Alpha put away Kap-

Theta Chi got into the win col-

lead with three runs in the third
inning, but Triangle bounced back
to only a 4-3 deficit after six inn-

two in the seventh. Dave Hauck
then held Triangle scoreless in
the bottom of the inning.

(Confirmed from Page 1)

Lead by youths carrying ban-
ners sporting the raised fist of
unity, an; organized by youthful
marshals shouting, “Women on
the inside andanybody who won’t
cooperate, leave,” the 3,000
strong band of supporters moved
into town.

Ignoring their police escort at
front, rear and sides, their swell-
ling ranks clapped and sang “Free-
dom” and “Hey, awright” over
and over again. '

Traffic began to get heavy
around 9 a.m., but observers on
the sidelines stopped everything
to see what was going on. Drug
stores and banks locked their
doors; the stores that remained
open were deserted.

People hung out of windows and
doorways, their faces and com-
ments revealing their confusion,
disgust, amusement or fear. One
man standing in the entrance of a
bar on Fifth Ave. was angry.

His mouth was shaking as he
.spoke. “No, I don’t-like this,” he
said. “I never could get into a un-
ion. Don’t ask me why. What am
I doing now? I’m a bartender and
I don’t like it.”

The growing demonstration
passed two firmly leashed Ger-
man shepherds. -Moving down
Grant St_., up Ross and onto Fifth,
the march flowed ‘under the Bridge
if Sighs connecting -the County

Courthouse and the County Jail. To
some of the marchers, it appear-
ed aimless.

“Byrd Brown,” yelled a teen-
aged black girl. “Make up your
damn mind where we’re going to.”

Brown, a leader and spokes-
man for the Black Coalition, was
flanked throughout the three hour
march by an aged City Police In-
spector. He had been on the force
for 19 years.

“I’m black. I feel no conflict
because I’m a policeman. This is
a case of right and wrong and I
know this is right. Why, these
kind of people got me my job,” he
smiled.

The apparent aimlessness of the
marchers was resolved as the now
6,000 strong group approached the
construction site of the new US
Steel Headquarters Building, lo-
cated at Seventh and Grant Sts.

Sparks from .the construction
flew along with words. “We want
our union cards,” chanted the
demonstrators, “We want jobs.”
As they had done along the entire
route of the march, the marchers
called for their black brothers and
sisters to join them in their cause.

Police stood aside while the
throng, still maintaining order,
surrounded the site. Tim Stevens,
youth coordinator of the Pitts-
burgh" NAACP and graduate stu-
dent at the University, tried to ex-
plain what was happening.

“This really shows that Pitts-
burgh is still behind us. It was two
weeks since the last demonstra-
tion,” he believed. “The police are
trying to cooperate. In the first
place, the tactical unit has been
placed in reserve. You won’t see
more than a few dogs. This was
negotiated between the Coalition
and the Police Department.

“In the second place,” he con-
tinued. “The police don’t even
have clubs. Almost half of them
are black. It is very important
that there are less police than be-
fore because police incite violence
by their presence. It’s psychologi-
cally damaging.”

A group of more than 100 stu-
dents and faculty from the Uni-
versity showed up to offer ‘a spe-
cial kind of support for the Coali-
tion. According to student Don
Newman, the Friends of the Black
Construction Coalition, sporting
in some cases white armbands
inscribed with its initials, planned
to provide “diversionary tactics
only if provoked.”
