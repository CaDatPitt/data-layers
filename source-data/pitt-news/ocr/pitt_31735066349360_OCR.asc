A super welcome for the black-and-blue wearers of the Black and

BY BRUCE WALDHOLTZ

The opening of a restaurant
addition to The'Wooden Keg on
Forbes Avenue has been delayed.
by a petition to the Liquor Control
Board (LCB) from Oakland Devel-
opment incorporated (ODI).

ODI, a coalition of 14 community

‘ﬁx;-groups ‘ and four institutional
E:-.'

niembers—Pitt, the Health Center,
Carlow College and the Oakland
Chamber of Commerce—petitioned
for a public hearing on the liquor
license extension requested by
Wooden Keg owners Barney
Silverman and Charles Nucci for
their new restaurant.

The restaurant, C. J. Barney's,
will occupy what was Winky’s and‘
Brother George’s Records and will
have an entrance separate from
The Wooden Keg’s.

The petition was drawn up in
November by ODI after it learned
of the planned extension from Jay
Roling. assistant to the. vice

Students Hitl-GRE Testing Conditions . 

chancellor of Public Affairs [and
Pitt’s representativeto ODI.

Rolin g had received a letter from

the LCB asking if Pitt had any_

objection to an e_xtension of The
,Wooden Keg’s license. If granted,
the extension would come within
300 feet of the University, listed as
a “restricted institution” by the
LCB. .

Silverman said he felt ODI was
being unfair. “They never came
over here to see what we are
buliding,” he said. “It is not just
an extension of the Keg. It is a
respectable restaurant for respect-
able people which we wish .to have
included under our liquor license.”

ODI inspected the restaurant
after a meeting among Roling,
Silverman, Nucci and ODI’s Public
Safety Committee.

ODI member Bob Casciato said, ’

‘‘It was not the dark room with only
a log bar and peanut shells on the
floor that I had expected to ﬁnd.”

did agree with Silverman that i
“there had been a serious lack of
communication” over the matter.

The Committee may recommend ‘

ODI to withdraw its petition but its
next meeting is after the scheduled
LCB hearing. , -

The owners said ﬁnancial con-
siderations may cause them to open
the restaurant next Friday, before
the scheduled hearing without
alcoholic beverages.

’ Roling said the University is in a
“strained position.” V’ “We are
doing everything we can to help
upgrade the neighborhood around
the campus and cannot come out in.
favor of more bars,” he said. “We
cannot deny the right of business-
men to expand.”

7 Healso said ODIidid' notfeel The
Wooden Keg _was' specifically
responsible for the violence prob-
lem in the area, but that the
ﬁghting of- the expansion was a
means of expressing its frustration
at the community’s deterioration.

 A computer-based information

system expanding University plan-
ning and resource-management
will be developed in a few years.

“ 7 Pitt has been developing its

computer-based information man-

I . agement system since 1972,‘ in a

- 10-year plan. ~ ‘With the Mellon

 grant and an additional $300,000 in;

, University funds,-the project could
be completed in four years.
' “The University has had men of

_ its own working on the develop- ‘
. ‘_ ment of the management system,”
."Vice Chancellorfof Planning and
.’_- . 1 Budget Jack Freeman said.

, “The Mellon grant will help us to
accelerate the system three to four
_ years,” he said. “It gives us

— V. up-front budgeting.”

_ . Pitt, receiv_ed the grant in
jDecember. According to Freeman,
,the University applied for the grant
. and received it when the Mellon
Foundation showed interest in
 management-information systems.
"I In its funding request, Pitt cited
--the need for stabilization of
_, enrollments and resources that
require 1 ‘more detailed program
analysis and reallocation of funds,
. increased reporting ‘requirements
agencies and
sponsors and improved manage-
.ment of an increasingly complex
institution. . _
' Essentially, the project involves
the design and development of a
comprehensive, integrated infor-
mation system composed of SIX
‘major data bases of information
necessary for operation and man-
agement of the University.
' “The grant will be used to clean

 

up the data bases that we use for

deriving__management informa-
tion,” Freeman said.
The six data bases are:
—student information, ranging
from registration data to grades

I and transcripts

—ﬁnancial data, including such
items as accounts receivable,
research accounting and ﬁscal
reporting _

-—planning and budget informa-
tion, including analytical informa-
tion and physical space-planning
data

—staff and faculty payrolls,
personnel and manpower control
information .

—alumni records

—course information

Freeman said Pitt’s information-
management system is soundly
based, but needs a lot of work to
make it more than adequate.

Some 35,000 students are en-

rolled in the main and four regional

campuses. Pitt employs. 2,063
full-time faculty members, and its
budget exceeds $170 million. _

Since 1965, the student body'has
increased 196%. The number of
faculty has gone up 175°/o~and the
budget has increased from just
under $56 million to its present
level. In addition, major" construc-
tion programs have added 1.2
million’ square feet 'to Pitt’s
physical plant. .

“We are now going to be trying
to hammer out more details and
develop ﬁnal objectives,” Director
of Systems Administration Arthur
Shuker said. .

According to Shuker, the grant
will not be used until all the plans

« are completely outlined.

Unanimous opposition to any
kind of payment by students for
football tickets next year was
voiced last night at one of the last
meetings of the present Student

‘Government Board (SGB) mem-

bers. _

SGB" member Craig Bluestein
made the motion to express
opposition to any system requiring
payment.

The payment issue, currently
being considered by an ad hoc
committee formed by Chancellor
Wesley Posvar, grew out of a battle
in September over the controversial
coupon system.

The ad hoc committee, which will
meet again Friday at 3 p.m. in 119
S.U., reportedly is considering a
system in which students would
pay‘ up to $2 _per game, but no
official recommendations have
been made.

Also at Tuesday's abbreviated
SGB meeting, the Board approved
a $472 budget modiﬁcation by the
Programming Committee to send
two representatives to a ﬁve-day
National Entertainment Confer-
ence in Washington, D.C., next
month.

A request for $373 from the SGB
publications budget was approved

It lists public and private toilets

BUDGET ACT
MONITORS CONGRESS

WASHINGTON. (AP)—When
Congress gets President Ford’s
budget today the new machinery
the lawmakers constructed to give
themselves a better grip on the
nation’s ﬁscal plans will go fully
into effect for the first time.

The Budget Act not only invites

' Congress to set spending ceilings

for itself, but it imposes a tight
timetable on all legislative actions
that have to do with money.
House Speaker Carl Albert in an
interview said budget items will
take precedence and all general
legislation will have to stand aside

_ until the early deadlines are met.

Once Congress has set its
guidelines by’ adopting the first
budget resolution it is free to go
ahead with legislation authorizing
spending and providing the actual
funds. The Budget Ofﬁce and the
two budget committees, however,
will be monitoring the process andl
advising Congress periodically how
its actions compare with the

targets. _

LABOR SEC’Y .'

TO BE NAMED TODAY
WASHINGTON (AP)—President
Ford will name his third secretary
of labor “very,’very shortly,” and
White House sources say the job
will go today to a man who was up
for the Cabinet post twice before:
chief federal mediator W.J. Usery

' Jr.

Usery, 52, was passed over for
the job twice before—when Presi-

dent Richard Nixon named New

York labor leader Peter Brennan to
the jobpin 1973, and when Ford
chose Harvard economist John

Dunlop to succeed Brennan last

March. ,

Sources said Ford‘ offered Usery
the Cabinet post during a private
meeting last Firday. He must be
confirmed by the Senate.

ESSAY CONTEST

The March Society, a service
organization concerned with evolu-
tionary humanism, is sponsoring
the second annual “Design for
Living" essay contest. Each
participant should submit an essay
of no fewer than 1,200 words
discussing the implications of the
following Statement:

“Contemporary politicians suffer
from myopia. Their instinct is to
think about immediate return,
immediate consequences. In opting
for the popular expedient, politi-
cians fail to deal‘ ‘with the most
signiﬁcant long-term social, eco-
nomic and political problems.

“Only through purposeful cul-
tural design can ,Western man
survive the ecological and techno-
logical crisis which now confronts
him. If planned economics, perfec-
tionist societies and other Utopian
ventures’ have failed, we must

~remember’that unplanned, undie-

tated and unperfected_ cultures
have failed, too.

Perhaps it is not now possible to
design a successful culture as a
whole, but we must design better
practices, if onlyrin a piecemeal
fashion, and hope for their eventual
integration into a. broader frame-
work of community.”

Fifty dollars will be awarded to
the ﬁrst-place entry and a $25 prize

. will go to the second-place winner.

Certificates will be issued to the
first two runners up. .

All entries should be submitted
to: Awards Chairman, Design for
Living, The March Society, 7927
Jackson Rd-., Alexandria, Va.,
22308. Entries must be received by
April 15.

All entries will become the
property of the March’ Society.

Letters to the Editor

IFC Defends  
Greek System

This letter is in regard to Bill
Moore's article “Avoiding” It Like
the Plague” which appeared in The-
Pitt News on Jan. 14. The article
concerns the lack of student
interest in the upcoming Student
Government elections, the issues
or lack of issues that appear to be

the major ones of the campaign,

and lastly, the interest in these
upcoming elections that has been
exhibited by the Interfraternity
Council. _
Moore’s analysis of the election
seems to be that students are too
interested _ in ‘‘money’’'' to ,be
concerned with the “issues” of this
year’s campaign. He listed these
“issues” as faculty unionization,
quality ofeducation and admini-
strative red tape. He states, in
fact, that “This year’s election‘, you
see, is fast becoming a one-issue
campaign-——V‘Who, in their inﬁnite
wisdom, will the Greeks endorse’_ ”
We believe that Moore not only

belittles the Greek system at Pitt, -

but the entire studentbody as well.

Moore must realize this fact.

Another aspect Moore failed to
note in his article is that we will
support the candidates on our slate
to the best of our abilities, but the
candidates must also campaign for
themselves. ' They must prove
themselves to the rest of the
University community and to the
members of our organizations. In
his noble attempt to stir interest in
the upcoming election, he does a
great disservice because he might

a have turned off those students who

were the majority of electorate in
last year’s election, by inferring

that Greeks have less of an ability

marks his ballot,‘ whether Greek or

Some Objections
To Endorsements

I would like to make some
criticisms concerning your edi-
torially endorsing one of the
candidates for Student Government

president.
Your editorial states that this
candidate “has _the ‘necessary

combination of enthusiasm and

sound planning to place him-

sufficiently above his nearest

competitor.” This mere, and quite “ \

unconvincing, assertion is a prime
example ofrhetorical banality, for
your editorial fails" to explain how
you derived your conclusion. Upon
what criteria-did you determine
“the necessary combination of
enthusiasm and sound planning”?

. Was your decision made solely on

the basis of the 15-minute
interviews alloted to each presi-
dential candidate?

In determining enthusiasm, why
did you not consider experience in
Student Government affairs?
Surely, the amount of time
committment made in the ‘past as a
result of previous experience would
be a valid indicator ofsan individual

‘candidate’s enthusiasm. But you

failed to take note of this.

Your editorial also states that
your endorsed presidential candi-
date “has pledged utilization of
other student leaders (Greeks,
engineers, etc.).to form a broader
power base from which to
operate.” Again you failed to
take note of the fact -that ALL of the
presidential candidates made this
pledge, as well as many candidates

for the Board. You then make the "

claim that your endorsed presiden-

- tial candidate possesses a “will-

ingness to confront_ the faculty
unionization issue head on, man-

¢n"‘\

euvering among the various union -*""““‘.,.,}'

factions to the students’ best
interest.” If your endorsed
presidential candidate’s

statements concerning faculty’ -
unionization are to be taken as a
willingness to confront the issue
and to work in the students’ best
interest, then again this claim can
be made on behalf of the other
presidential candidates for their
statements concerning this issue

can also be perceived in just this
‘fashion. V

V In summary, your editorial
endorsement of a particular candi-

'date for Student Government

president was long on rhetorical

assertion and short on analytical  -

proof. I support your newspaper's
right" to responsible editorialism.
However, in this particular case the
word responsible does not apply.

Each year’ at,this' time a small

There is another group
candidates. This group encom-
passes students whose purpose in
running is ‘ to publicize their
particular beliefs or cause. These
individuals ignore issues important
to students because they are totally
engrossed in promoting their
narrow cause. Their hope is that if
they win they can materially
benefit the special interests to
which they belong. The funny
thing is that a few. candidates of
this type become known as Student
Government Board members and

.occassionally become known -as

president of Student Government.

Of course not all the candidates
are like that. There are always a
few candidates who do not know
what the Student Government is all
about. This group frequently
consists of” students already in
Student Government. This group
is perceptive (and deceptive) for

of-

individuals are generally not
candidates; most of them do not
think they could win if they ran and
they think they would not have any
impact if they did win. The funny
thing is that they are correct.

What this group has learned is A

that Student Government has only
minimal power in inﬂuencing what
happens to students in the
_University. They know that
Student -Government is merely an
entity sanctioned by the University
administration to keep student
dissent and frustration organized in
a body they can control. And the
administration does control it. ‘Any
decision made by the SGB can be
‘overridden by the administration,
and whenever the SGB oversteps
the strict boundaries set by the

administration their decisions are’

overriden.

The ‘most amazing thing about
this situation is how it continues
and perpetuates itself. Each year

the interests of the papers are

Moye  /1Mani In The Middle The purse/S power.

 

 

 

_ » BY W. JACK ROMBERG

‘‘ The ofﬁce is plush. Covered by a

i;‘T'_. rich, blue carpet and populated
’ with plants, it would almost seem

more appropriate in a corporate
office building than in Schenley
Hall. Behind the desk sits the often

I  maligned, sometimes-disliked, but

always-respected Dr. Alfred Moye,

_ vice chancellor of Student Affairs.

_ Moye is in a precarious position.
He is the man who hears
everyone’s complaints—adminis-
trators- and students—and he is
often expected to advocate the
-conﬂicting positions of both of

I these groups. Subsequently, Moye
is constantly being blamed for

something.

There are, of course, no deﬁnite
boundaries.» But like any good
administrator, Moye tries to sort
things out. I

“We try to be the students’
advocate when it is appropriate to
be their advocate, that is, when we
meet with other administrators,”
Moye said. But he continued, “I
get the impression very often that

_ students view you (an administra-
tor) as being an advocate when you
endorse everything they say. Ijust
won’t do that.”

, So there itkis, the contradiction
that summarizes Moye’s position.

 ' . He is forced to play “monkey in the

middle” for the administration,
"sometimes leaving little room for
his personal convictions, of which
there are many. ,
For one, Moye is committed to

: the value of the undergraduate

degree, but thinks “it should be put
in proper perspective.

VICE CHANCELLOR '
ALFRED MOYE

“I think society can absorb the

large number of degrees. Our
mistake is in the impression we
think the degree has. Let’s stop
acting as if every job ..needs a
degree.”

One of the good things about
Pitt, Moye said, is that it does not
hassle an individual over gradua-
tion. People can enter and leave
whenever they choose. Further,
the opportunity is open to many.

Moye is an incurable Pitt fanatic
and agrees he often gives the
impression of being an ambassador
for the University.

“I’m that way when I’m away
from here. I have a lot of good
feelings about Pitt, so I think I do
act as an ambassador.”

Butthis commitment to Pitt is
the cause of some of the more
unrewarding aspects of his job.
Moye gets angry when he sees
what he thinks is vast potential at ‘

THE FRANKLIN PANGBORN FILM SOCIETY is proud to present‘

he feels, when people ignore the
complexities of problems and
expect him to act in their interest.

‘‘I find that people tend not to try
to understand all sides of an issue
and expect you to respond with

' their narrow vision.”

But perhaps’ Moye’s biggest
problem is the way he and other
administrators are perceived by the
faculty and students. Moye agrees
that these groups view him as a
person wielding power, V therefore

‘someone automatically to be.

mistrusted.

Much of an individual’s percep-
tion of an administrator,‘ according
to Moye, may have to do with his
title. He said that -when his own
title was changed from “dean” to

“vice chancellor,” friends warned v

him that faculty and students
would see him differently. -

What makes the problems of
perceptions even more complicated
is Moye’s sometimes having ‘to
answer for areas of the University
over which he has no control. He
cites the football-ticket issue as one
of these circumstances.

“This was thrown in my lapﬂin a
SAAC meeting when the students
asked who would make the final
decision on the system .4 I answered
that ‘I thought Mr. Myslinski
(athletic director) would since it
was an athletic department affair,
but Dr. Posvar said I would make
the decision.” '

Moye said he was originally
opposed to the coupon system and
that he had wanted either a
computerized system using identi-
fication~cards or a paying system.
He became directly involved when
the chancellor asked that his office
do the staff’ workon the coupon
system. Then, after the issue
broke, he was forced to deal with
Student Government.

One Man’s Opinion

BY BILL MOORE

Power, like blue smoke drifting
through a room full of mirrors, is
impossible to catch, to pinpoint, to
diagram; according to author
Jimmy Breslin.

Accordingjto political scientists,
it is merely difficult, not imposs-
ible, and only journalist-authors
like Breslin reduce it to such glib
similes. .

To students, it is something that
runs rampant through the Cathe-
dral, but does not exist .anywhere
near the Student.Union, especially
not in Student Government.

The Platts and Furicks of the
student body can scream and yell
and get their picture on the front
page of The Pitt News, but it is all a
joke, according to the majority of
undergrads. .

If it were, perhaps I could rejoin
the wave of apathy I was so much a
part -of two years ago. It is a
pleasant prospect.

But, the awful fact is, Student
Government, the butt of more jokes
than the Poles and Italians
combined, handles almost $300,000-
yearly. That’s a threewith ﬁve
zeros after it. Enough for 20 luxury
model Mercedes Benz’s, or 300
years tuition.

I'stop to think what I could do
with $300;000 and suddenly‘ it

. makes a difference if Chaban beats
-Gronsky, Gronsky -beats Satinoff,

Satinoff beats Weisband, or Weis-
band beats Chaban. One of those
four Student Government candi-

dates will be controlling my 20

Mercedes Benz’s next year.
Seriously, the SGB distributes
approximately that much money to
student groups and student activi-
ties during their 365 day regime. A

‘The money comes from the

Activities Fee, and ‘$12 of that

‘comes from each of us.

Assuming the rest of. the other
six Board members cooperate, a
student government president
could do some drastic things with
all of those $12 fees.

Theoretically, "a vehemently anti-
ﬁlm Board could "leave the Franklin
Pangborn Film Club penniless, and
Pitt students movieless; while a
vehemently pro-unicycle Board
could give the Unicycle Club
enough money to install tacho-
meters and tape decks under their
seats. .

Granted, those examples border
on the absurd, but considering the

4}] /.,

Greek, Socialist, Commuter, and -

other ties, of this year’s candidates,
the capacity for abuse of power is
there. No one is saying that abuse
will happen—it rarely has in the
past—but it is a possibility.

And ruling out such unjust
favoritism, mere stupidity on the
part of a Board could send that
$300,000 streaming into some very
absurd places; and no matter what
the average student believes, it will
affect him in the long run.

Mere stupidity, too, as oppose<1.¥»l“:‘._“;.\..A

to dishonesty, could eliminate one
of the few checks the students have
on the administration. While .a
Student Government president
can’t threaten ‘Chancellor ‘Posvar
with his job, he can embarass him
in front of the news media, the
Board of Trustees, and the faculty
if the Chancellor were to try an
obviously unjust move. «This has
been done on more than one
occasion this year, and students are
better off for it. i A stupid‘
President, or an unconcerned one,
would never catch the administra-
tive antics, and we would end up

paying for not only football tickets --eif?

and time schedules, but elevator
and library usage.

If you think Student Government
has no power, elect a few idiots.
But don’t complain if they wrap
your Mercedes around a tree.

 Greek Tragedy

“Medea”rDebuts At Theater Q

BY GARY L. TWEED

Medea, the latest production of
the Studio Theater, is an assault on
the idea of myth. Medea evolved

through research, improvisational
scenes conducted by the cast and
actual scenes adapted from various
versions of the myth.

Cheryl G. McFadden, director of
"the production, described the play
as “a series of ﬂashbacks and
premonitions. We don't want (the
audience) to have one dydactic
version of the myth.”

Described as an experimental
play, Medea incorporates ritualistic
combat based on worship of the
god Dionysus. This ritual is

. common in classical Greek theater.

The play, however, is more
experimental than classical. It
attempts to explore relationships
-through a series of ambiguous
scenes.

Medea is obviously a complex
experiment. The play contains 175
lighting cues, for example, and

immense if not insurmountable
technical problems. In one scene,
Medea’s b’rother is dismembered
onstage, and the pieces are thrown
at the feet ofhis father.

The props for this sequence were
made by encasing the actor’s body
in heavy cold cream and aluminum
foil (as in Woody Allen's Sleeper).

‘Then a body cast_ was made with
surgical plaster. .

“Time has been our biggest

problem,” McFadden said’. The

cast has been great. ’l'hey gave up
' some of their Christmas vacation
to work on the play.

“Think of Medea as an experi-
ment. We don't know whether. it is
a successful experiment. Just say
we have begun our search.”

The production will begin tomor-
row night. at 8:30 in the Studio
Theater -in the basement of the
Cathedral. The play will run until
Jan. 31 at 8:30 and on Feb. 1 at 2

pm.‘ For ticket information, call E“l'iPid93“t1‘3g€d)'-

“A lot of people would like to see
Armand Schaubroeck dead,” reads

, the caption across the cover of

Armand Schaubroeck Steals, not
really. anew album-—actually a year
and a half off the presses—but new
in this neck of the woods.
Pittsburgh , not being one to
attract the obscure, hence the
unique, almost let this three-record
set slip by without a good listen.
Distributed by Mirror Records,
i.e. Armand Schaubroeck, you
won’t ﬁnd this one at your -favorite
record store. Though Warner

- Brothers was ‘at one time inter-

ested, they dropped the idea, and
now Armand Schaubroeck Steals
(A.S;S. to the companies that

-turned it down, says Armand) is

available only through the mail.
The album deﬁes categorization.
Call it a comedy a la Carlin or
Cheech and Chong, ‘and several
serious spots in it stare you in the
face. Say it’s a Lenny Bruce satire,
and- sombody’ll point out that half
of it’s music. A rock opera it isn’t.
Several things are certain:
s ,bev_vil
. 

it’s ,
der-”_

 

ing, and yet brilliant. .

~ In the great protest vein of the
Sixties, Schaubroeck presents six
sides of rhymes, rhythms, and

dialogue that contend with the’

injustices of the American penal
system.

Schaubroeck is one upon famous
flag—waving minstrels though.
‘The thing he viliﬁes—inhuman
prison conditions—he’s seen ﬁrst-
hand. Sentenced to the aforemen-
tioned Elmira for three years in
1962 for grand larceny and
burglary, the 17-year-old Sch_au-
broeck was in for the proverbial
time of his life. _

He chronicles his experiences
here. The sense of abandonment,
the yearning for women, the
pressure to go gay, the suicides.

The album opens with Schau-
broeck innocently enough in a
confessional _for the first time in
three years: “I disobeyed my
mother three times...er...five
times. I fought with my brothers
six times...”

I But the priest is a veteran angler
for sins. ‘ Eventually he has
Schaubroeck saying: “I stole
things. . .stereos, radios, ampliﬁers,
and money-, Father...I committed
32 burglaries, and one was a
church...”

Schaubroeck does a similar job
on Dr. Leiderman, state psycholo-
gist, and Mr. Tomato, state public
relations director for Elmira.

The routine with" Tomato is also a
take-off on Cheech and Chong’s
“Sister Mary Elephant,” the
classroom satire that was a hit at so
many Boone’s Farm parties with
the junior high set. While
“Elephant” sacriﬁced realism in

the class vocabulary in order to"

make it on the AM air waves, “Mr_.

Tomato Addresses the New In-.

mates” leaves no holds barred.

It’s not meant to be as funny as
it’s meant to be real, which is the
essential difference.

A particularly unpleasant se-
quence, and all the better for it, is
“Christmas Eve in Elmira,” in
which a con sent up for statutory

rape (the girl's parents—not the -»

girl—pressed~ charges) suffers

through another holiday without. at
her. Unable to sleep at 3 a.m. 'and_

with her latest letter telling him
that her folks are trying to ﬁx her
up with the guy down the street, he
conﬁdes in his cellmate.

While tshecellmate jokingly asks
if he got her drunk beforehand, his
forlorn friend is busy hanging not
mistletoe or holly but himself. ,

The musical side of the album is
not as sharp. Much of it sounds
like the kids down the street who

-practice in some dad’s. garage.

Schaubroeck’s vocalizing is imita-
tive of Dylan and the late Morrison,
and the instruments are one-
dimensional. - .

Schaubroeck is very serious
about prison reform. He’s spoken

to several prison boards about it

and he’s made a serious yet
unsuccessful bid for the New York
State Senate with.reform as oneof
his platform planks. V

The man who conceived of,
wrote, and performed Armand
Schaubroeck Steals obviously
knows what .he’s talking about.
Why a lot of people would like to
see ‘Armand Schaubroeck dead

merely ‘ for f rtellirrg-ezthe - truth is

indicative of the times we live in.

Julliard Quartet ‘Best’

in Local Music Scene

V BY PAMELA EUSI

An all-Beethoven program came
to Carnegie Music Hall Monday
night, courtesy of the best string

.. quartet in the country—the J ulliard

String Quartet. The combination of
a great composer and great artists
proved to be mind-boggling for the
audience and helped to underscore
the quality music being heard in
this area lately.

Opening with the cheerful
Quartet No. 2 in G Major, Opus No.
‘2, the quartet immediately estab-
lished itself with the close-knit
harmonies that served to empha-
size the extraordinary sense‘ of
balance and unity it possesses.’
The perfect balance made it
possible to close your eyes and feel
that you were sitting at home
listening to your expensive stereo.

Robert Mann as ﬁrst violinist is
the only charter member of the
quartet and he remains the leader
both onstage and offstage. Beeth-
oven wrote his quartets for the best
musicians, and the ﬁrst Violin parts
are- extremely_ difﬁcult. Mann
managed these with the skill that
only talent and almost 30 years of

» experience allow.

The opening theme used a
number of strong attacks and
dialogue between" varying duets to
climb to lofty musical heights.
Mann’s technical abilities were
enhanced further by the tone colors
from Samuel Rhodes on viola and
Joel Krosnick oncello.

lntertwining harmonies from the ’

ﬁrst and second vi0lins- -(Earl

Carlyss as second violinist) and .

quick musical peaks culminated in
a series of violin runs. A jittery
dance theme’ slowed to spotlight a
cello solo. Quick, rhythmic attacks
jumped from player to player as the
theme disappeared only to creep up
in every ‘section of the group.
The fourth movement rushed in
like a March windwith a feeling of
excitement and foreboding. The
ﬁnale repeated’ the main theme

several times until it seemed that

Beethoven could exhaust those few
notes no more.

Beethoven's last complete work
made up the second number on the
program. Quartet No. -16 in F

(Major, Opus 135 offered a concise
view of a few Haydn elements,
along with remnants of the Nint{\'§§.
Symphony.

Broad lines with Beethoven’
dynamics led into a crazy dance as
‘the first violin ﬁddled wildly and *
the other three members repeated
50 times a .. ﬁve-note‘ pattern.
Intensity reached its height here
when the bows rattled from the
effort put forth by the quartet.

In perfect contrast to the
previous section, the third move-
ment glided .through a theme and
its four variations. Then the cello
and viola. sounded loud chords
answered by the ﬁrst and second

‘violins at strange intervals. Lively
echoing parts followed by, 9.fj»sg_
pizzicato section with a violin solo”
paved. the way for a wavering
ﬁnale.

After a short break, Quartet No.
7 in F Major, Opus 59, No. 1 was
performed. Coming from that
same fertile period as the Fifth
Symphony (dit-dit-dit-dah!) No. 7
received mixed reviews at its
premiere, and I don't wonder why.

String tremolos accompanied a
soaring cello solo that displayed a

tremendous power potential and
certain fugue-like qualities. The
theme continued to be tossed from
part to part, and- the bowing
movements dominated in‘ the.

. whirlwind of technique. ‘~"~—-,

The moods quickly changed frorfi“
tragic to jubilant, with highlights
coming in the countermelodies
between the varying duets. An
uninhibited folk theme with Rus-
sian origins established itself in the
cello and was built up and swirled
around in as many ways as

Beethoven could possibly manage.

Another of his favorite tricks was
to lead the audience to believe that
the present chords are the ﬁnal
ones (fake endings). In this
quartet, he used this effect
upwards of three times, which
really is,a bit much. . '

The Julliard Quartet obviously
enjoyed Monday's concert. If
nothing else, it is a group of serious
musicians who actually like what

they do: A rarity in this world. 4-‘

; M0ye’s Dilemma As
,;Man In TheMiddle  

(Colttiltuktl from P11]/(3 6)
because of » his dealings with
Student Government. And when
issues such as the football tickets
go against the students, he is cast
in the role of villain. This role is
enhanced because Moye is not
afraid to be critical of Student
Government.

“I sometimes question whether
student leaders really represent
their constituency on certain
issues. I tell them they have to get

; ,f~;,ut and ﬁnd out what the rank and
*. zrile are thinking”, ‘

-x

~a=-\-34-.

One of the most important
tangible powers of Student Gov-
ernment, according to Moye, is the
power to appoint student represen-
tatives to Senate committees. And,
he feels, students take this role too
lightly.

“One of the biggest complaints I
hear from Senate faculty members
is that the student members hardly
ever show up at the meetings.”

Like any person, Moye has an
unfulﬁlled ambition;
hand in the business, world. .He
considers this strange because" of
his long association with the
University atmosphere, but feels

:.___h_e would have a fair chance of
/7

‘gﬁiccess.
f‘It takes a healthy, active, very

to try his _

good mind to succeed in-.business.
Ithink the skills I’ve learned would
serve me well coupled with the
time I’ve spent in the classroom.”
The image of the corporate ofﬁce
once again springs up, and if one
were to observe a Moye staff
meeting, he would think Moye
already had achieved his ambition.
Staffers meet around a confer-
ence table complete with cushioned
chairs. Each person at the table is
the director of a department under

Moye. They discuss budgets, other _

universities, and the successor
failure of projects in each depart-
ment. It seems very businesslike,
but Moye sees a difference.

‘‘I’m the coordinator, not . a
super-boss. I think the key
difference is in the total involve-
ment of the director in setting goals
and objectives, and not" just
handing them down from the top.”

Moye does and says everything
according to what he terms as “the
best interest of the University.”
And- he 'is usually open to
questions. I ~

Whether this openness is part of

public relations or a reflection of - '

the true nature of the man is hard
to determine. But Moye is offering
answers and advice to any who is
willing to listen.

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

For a Super Bowl parade, it
certainly wasn’t super. An
estimated 90,000 Steeler fans lined
downtown streets yesterday only to
see a handful of Steelers speed by
in PAT buses.»

The motorcade, originally sched-
uled for 2 p.m., had to be delayed
because of a late start from Miami.
And, according to most of the
Steeler fans who had lined the
streets since early afternoon, the 3
o'clock parade‘ wasn’t worth
waiting for. _

Most people sawonly the backs
of the fans in front of them,
because people were standing four
and five deep from the curbs.
Those who could see didn’t see
much, just a rapidly moving bus
with name cards under the
windows by the players’ seats.

.?‘-‘‘-‘‘I‘ guess they madewtheir money
already and didn’t want to bother
withthe parade,” said 20-year-old
Kevin McCabe of Edinboro. “I

wasted a trip down here just to see
a few high-school hands. «And they
weren’t very good anyway.”

wgdnéédéy, 1.5.3.,2l.iI1976;~mt T

Big Steeler Parade?

But just ‘ueing in the presence of

other Steeler fans was reason
enough to celebrate for most.
Teenagers sat on top of phone
booths waving Steeler pennants,
and a group of slightly confused
(inebriated) adults sang “The
Battle of New Orleans,” last year's
Super Bowl theme song.

“I didn’t come to see the

Steelers anyway,” said 98-year-old ‘

Viola Highet of Wilkinsburg. . “I
came so they would see me. I think
most of us are here to let the
Steelers know we support them.”

A majority of the crowd was
school kids on the loose because of
the teacher's strike, and they were
downtown to party. A 16-year-old
Mad Dog guzzling from a paper-

bag-covered bottle said he hadn’t.

even seen the game; he’d come
down just to mingle__ with the crowd.

Others came to mingle with the
wallets of the crowd. An enraged
Steeler fan stood on the corner of

_Fifth and Grant for 20 minutes,

swearing vengeance forjthe man

who had lifted his wallet. .
Hucksters were out in force, too.

.'‘,‘It really made me proud how

' . Dave Adams, head coach of the Pitt

wrestling team.

_ Practically the same statements, ,
"'* right? Granted, they are worded

differently, but the same ingredi-
ent exists in both quotes——the
immense pride instilled in someone

p when he’s come back against

overwhelming odds.
. And _so what does all this prove?
No, it doesn’t prove that John

2 Paul 3ones would have made a
I great wrestling coach. What it does

mean is that Adams had a lot of
pride in his team after a successful
stint in the Michigan Quadrangle,
the ﬁnal event.in the Panthers’
killer schedule.

, Pitt crushed helpless Illinois

 . State (to no one’s surprise), 21-9,

then followed a disappointing 19-12
loss to powerhouse Michigan with a

'9 devastating 25-11 victory over

Indiana.

A The two wins and one loss
pushed Pitt’s record to 9-1 on the
season.» A

» Despite not coming up with three

if -wins,-Adams had nothing but

praise, praise and more praise for
his_team.

“They're really fighters—that’s
their trademark,” Adams boasted.‘



“They scrap and ﬁght for anyting
they can get. As amatter of fact, I
can't remember any of our
wrestlers called for stalling."

Of course, stalling would have
been unethical—it would have
made Illinois State's torture last
that much longer. Pitt totally
dominated the match, never falling
behind and finally. overwhelming
State, 21-9.

But then came Michigan.

The match was a battle-in the
true sense of the word, but after

. the smoke lifted and the rubble was

cleared. it was standout Michigan
on top.

Adams was a little disappointed.

“Michigan had better talent, but
I felt we had the best-conditioned
team there," he said. “We were
disappointed—we felt we were as
good as Michigan.”

‘And maybe they were. But did
they let the disheartening loss to
the Wolfpack get them down?

The Panthers rebounded mar-
velously and manhandled the
stunned Indiana Hoosiers 25-11.‘

“It really'made me proud to see
how’ they bounced back against
Indiana,” Adams .beamed. “We
took it to them and beat them. We
were ready to wrestle.”

They sure were. The Hoosiers
expected a tough match, but not an
outright onslaught.’

“We were doing th_ings¥—not
waiting,” Adams said. “That may

Cats Collide Willi Cavs

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

_ It’s kinda tough living with a 4-10
record. But it’s even tougher trying

to improve that record on the road.

Tonight at 8, the Panthers will
try to do just that against the
Cavaliers of the University of
Virginia, another in the long line of
talented Atlantic Coast Conference

The Panther injury list is
dwindling, with the exception of
senior forward Keith Starr. It is
highly unlikely that Starr will see
any action for the Cats this year.

It is unlikely, too, that he will
accept a medical redshirt. .“I really
can’t say right now,”
conﬁded. “_Right now, I'm just
waiting for the pro draft. If the
offers aren’t exactly what I have in
mind, then I could possibly return

- for another year at Pitt.”

Now for the good news. Both
Tom Richards and Ralph McClel-
land made the trip to Virginia.
They may or may not see action,
but it'_s got. to be good news that
they are at least up and around.

The Cavaliers, meanwhile, grab-
bed their eighth win. of the year

Starr_

against four losses in an 80-60 rout

‘of William and Mary on Monday

night.
Virginia’s scoring punch travels

I in the form of 6-7 forward Wally

Walker, who is averaging 22.5
points and 5.7 rebounds a game.
He is followed by another towering
forward, 6-9 Mark lavaroni (12.7
points) and hotshot guard Billy
Langloh (11.7 points).

The Cavs also have something-
the _Panthers have had trouble
overcoming all season long: the
big, hulking, dominating center.
Freshman center Otis‘ Fulton is
6-11, and he could send the
Panthers home special delivery if
he plays up to his potential.

According to Barney Cooke,
Virginia’s Sports Information Adi-
rector, “...his stats are pretty
unimpressive, but we all know how
deceptive‘ statistics can be.”

So does Pitt Coach Tim Grgurich.
After Larry Harris’ performance
against Syracuse, in which Harris
made 15 of 25 ﬁeld goal attempts
and totaled 39 points and' 12
rebounds, Grgurich could only say,
‘‘I can't be too impressed with his
game tonight. Larry is ca_pable of
that every night." -

BY STEVE SYBERT
Two and a half weeks is a long
time. That’s how long the Pitt

/‘-.»~Hockey Club will have to think

'%~\

;£‘

....

about the double walloping it got
from the University of Cincinnati, a
team the Panthers will face again in
Pittsburgh, Feb. 7.

Pitt forged. into the two battles
down the Ohio with conﬁdence and
with an impressive early season
record of 5-1-1-but, with only.one
other game in the past month, the
team was far from being sharp and
fell to the Bearcats, 12-5 and 12-3.

The Panther_s played without the
services of their captain and top
scorer, Rick Vernon, but blamed
the outcomes on faulty -ofﬁciating
by the “local" refs in Cincinnati.

‘‘It was the worst type of
officiating I have ever seen in any
type of hockey anywhere," said
coach Len Barcalow, ;a man who
has seen and coached many games.
“Cincinnati ‘was throwing elbows
around, but when our guys did
something they were the ones who
were whistled off the ice. One guy

ut an _elbow on Garv Fries that
ooked like a PAT bus slamming its

door and he got away with it.
“Anytime we picked up momen-

BY PATTY TASCARELLA
_ The Pantherette track team
opened the indoor season Saturday
at the Lafayette College Invitation-
al Indoor Relays, placing first in
four events: the 60 yard shuttle
dash relay (0:31.2), the mile relay
(4:16), the long-jump relay (32-6)
and the shot-put relay (66-2‘/2').

Women’s track at Pitt is unique
in that it was started by the
students themselves. About three
years ago, a group-of female track
fans went to Assistant Athletic
Director Sandy Bullman’s office
with plan_s-to start their own team.
Through the efforts of Bullman and
former Men’s Track Coach Jim
Banner,_ the team was ofﬁcially
‘founded.

Now, under second-year coach
Georgia McDaniels, the Panther-
ettes are developing into a real
power in intercollegiate competi-
tion.

Although Pitt is a member of the.
Eastern Association for Intercolle-'
giate Women’s Athletics, the team
does not belong to a conference.
The schedules for the indoor and
outdoor seasons are not yet’
completed. In other words,
women’s track is still .in the
building stages.

McDaniels has a fairly young
team, mostly freshmen and sopho-

/ e---_.mores, but . their credentials are

tum the whistle blew. That's not an
alibi. though._ They aren't that
much better than we are and I don't
think they will beat us again when
they come here.”

The line up for the first game’s
officials was apparently misunder-
stood, as a Cincinnati player and a
rink employe donned. the striped

- shirts and...well, you can figure out

the rest. .

In the first 12 minutes of game
one, the Panthers were dealt ﬁve
penalties and Cincinnati made off
with two quick power-play goals.
Pitt stayed close,» however, until
the Bearcats blew the game-open
with seven goals in the ﬁnal period.

In game two, with supposedly
fair refs, Pitt was dealt 16 penalties
while Cincinnati earned only nine.
Again, Pitt was plagued by

power-play goals, seven coming,

against the Panthers in the second
period. ,
“Our guys were not as bad as the

scores. indicated," "Barcalow said. .

“We fell_apart because we couldn't
skate and check well enough to kill
all those penalties and we became.
tired in the second halves of the
games. Our guys didn't quit, but
ran out of steam. Cincinnati is a

very impressive+especiauy tiose
of the three sophomore main stays

of the team, Michelle Bresuant,‘

Martha Suhayda and Karen
Krichko. I
Bressant, who is an outstanding
hurdler, was New Jersey state
champion three years in a row.
Like most of the Pantherettes, she
will double in another event, most
likelv some running competition.
Suhayda throws the "shot and
discus. She also placed fourth in
the USA-USSR Junior Women’s
Games.  - ‘
Krichko quite possibly could

make the high jump the strongest ‘

part of the Pitt attack.

“We’ll do well in the high
jump,” McDaniels said. We’ve
had girls at the AAU nationals and
the Pan Am tryouts. ’

“And we’ve got a lot of sprinters
that would be a strong point. And
of course, discus and high jump,”
she said. “Our weakest -point
would be that we need a little more
experience in distance.”

Facing a tough Ohio State squad
this weekend and a long-awaited
bout with Slippery Rock in
February, the Pantherettes are
ready for anything.

“It’ll be much better this year
than last,” McDaniels indicated,”

Barcalow said. “Those two losses

Revenge is sweet, especially
when it’s against Penn State.
Although Pitt's revenge came in a_
pool and" not on the gridiron, a
thorough trouncing of» any Penn
State team puts a wide grinpon the
(face of every Pitt sports fan.

_A thorough trouncingis exactly
what the Nittany Lions got when
the Panther tankers defeated them,
84-29, at University Park on
Saturday.

A Pitt took 12 of a possible 13 first
places, and eight of at possible 11
second places.

“It was an easy meet and our
times were good-,” said Coach Dick
Bradshaw in summing up his
swimmers’ performance.

The Panther blitz included wins
by Orlando Catanchi in the
200-yard breaststroke, Neal Wal-
lace in the 200-yard backstroke,
John Schepner in the 100-yard
freestyle and Steve Leach in the
50-yard freestyle.

Jerry DeMuro and Bob Green-

wald were double-winners; De- -
M_uro won the 200-yard freestyle.

and the 200-yard butterﬂy, while
Greenwald notched wins in the
200-and ‘1000-yard freestyles.

The divers—unquestionably the
tops in the East—grabbed all the
honors at Penn ‘State. Jeff Miller
took first place in the three-meter
competition by posting a score of
455.26, qualifying him for the
NCAAs. Miller had already quali-
ﬁed in the one-meter.

Dave Reeder, who also has
qualified for the NCAAS in the
one-meter diving, easily took first
place in that event.

The Panthers took both relays by
storm. In the 400-yard medley
relay‘, Wallace, Catanchi, Leah and
Bill Wagner defeated Nittany
Lions... while Wallace, DeMuro,
Greenwald and Schepner ran away
with the freestyle relay, formerly a
weak spot for the Panthers.

The Panthers brought their

season’s record to 4-0 with the

 Tnnkerssfay Undefeated  

impressive victory in which they ‘

did not even enter swimmers" in

their best events. Bradshaw chose :

instead to give his swimmers

experience at new events. : "

That manuever did not hurt the
Cats at all,
undefeated in all but two events.

The Panthers will meet .Kent
State on Friday night at T rees-~Pool.
