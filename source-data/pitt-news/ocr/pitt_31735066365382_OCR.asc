Architects unveiled three alternatives to the University‘s Phase I_

' plan for the construction of a Law School andvan education-social sci-

ence quadrangle at an open meeting Thursday night in the Student

'. ' ‘S Union. . ..
After reporting the results of six ‘.‘technical" meetings, the archi-

-..F I: 1' tects were told to resume the technical sessions and "grade" the three
’ ' _ plans, as well as the University's plan.

J.

_ The directive was issued -by Charles Blum. deputy directoriof the
General State Authority (GSA). '

In evaluating the plans the architects are likely to consider such

criteria as provisions for interface wi_th_the community, whether .
. streets would be blocked or closed, aesthetic considerations, and the

time needed to complete a design. ’
According to GSA architect, .\/Iario Celli, the completion of a .de-,

sign‘ could take only four months or as long as 24 months. One alterna— -
 ;tive would involve 6-8 months; another would take 10 months. The.Uni-

_V versity‘s plan would take four months and the community's 24.

Attention at Thursdays meeting was riveted on the first two“plans.

 ' which represent attempts at a compromise solution.

 

 

 

 

The one alternative would retain the structure in the location sug-
gested by the University but would raise it on stilts one level above the
ground, leaving floor and roof space for community use. Because the

‘proposal would block Bouquet, Joncaire and Sennott Sts., however, it

— invites objections from both the city and the community. People's Oak-
land architect Walt Boykowycz also criticized the plan on the grounds
that it “does not use land frugally.” The plan would require 6-8 months
for design cpmpletion.

The other alternative would flip the structure around 90 degrees so

it would run parallel to Schenley Park. This plan. unlike the other.

. would not involve the blocking of Bouquet or Sennott. It-would involve
10 months for design completion.

The Universitys Phase I plan has been attacked by the commun-
ity and the city because of inadequate provisions for interface with the
community and because it would involve the blocking of Bouquet and
Sennott Sts. ' '

The community’s proposal for a complete redesign has, in turn,
«met with criticism from the University and the GSA, on the grounds

A A that it would take too long.

 According to Blum. the GSA is losing half a million dollars every .
~- month the construction of Phase I is delayed. '

Dr. David Houston of the Economics Department, a member of
Peoples Oakland.‘ challenged that estimate. chargingthat Blums fig-
ure was “substantially inflated."

A Blum’s figure is based on an estimated inflation rate of one per
cent per month in the building trade industry. Quoting Department of

‘i-' Commerce statistics, Houston suggested that one-half per cent per

Further court action on a suit‘

against the University alleging
sex discrimination in hiring will
be delayed until the question of
whether- or not the. University’s
V, administrative policy is influ-.
enced by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania is answered.

The problem-arose during the
suitls preliminary hearing Thurs-
day when Pitt’s'legal‘coun'sel said
that the 1871 Ku Klux Act, under
which Dr. Ina Braden is suing the
University, states that "only col-
or of. state law that causes the

party to be deprived of any rights 

under the constitution permits a
party to file suit." “ ‘ v -

James Arensberg, a University K
- lawyer, asked, ‘.‘Has Pitt discrim-

inated against Braden under col-
or of state law? Since 1887 Pitt
has been a private institution and
has’ virtually complete control of
its activities.”

He added that when Pitt be-
came state-related’ in 1966. other
than accounting for'its financial»
affairs to the state, a tax free stat-

_ us, and the appointment of a new

Board of Trustees, Pitt still re-
tained administrative contr'o
over its affairs. ‘

Silvia Roberts, one of Braden‘s
attorneys, argued that University
affairs are definitely linked to the
state. ’

She claimed “Pitt received
about 34.5 per cent of its budget
from the state, which it has to an-
swer for and the state gets the
right to appoint 15 of the 36-mem-
ber Board of Trustees to the Uni-
versity.”

University attorneys also at-
tacked Braden's class action suit
claiming it misrepresents Univer-
sity employees. E. Edward Bruce
charged “no one else has claims
such as Braden, therefore she is

representing herself. Perhaps she

could sue in an.—individual capacity
but not for the other 480 Universi-
ty professional women.’

“ Essentially, a class action suit is a
legal actionfiled by one person for
the benefit of a larger group of
people. ‘ . »

Countering Bruce’s statement,
David -Berger, a second attorney
for the plaintiff cited a recent
University report that revealed
among other things that the aver-
age salary of jobs for Pitt women

_ Killy took time out from his

Thursday at Joseph Horne's de-

about his new roles as actor and

Winner -of three gold medals

skiing. He suppressed a smile
when asked if anyone in the ski-

‘if someone is as good as me, or

do it.”

' "Killy had ample.opportunity
I to perfect his" skiing style
growing up on the snows at Val
d‘Isere in the French Alps.

“I started to ski» at about
three years old and was ‘lucky

T . to be born in a ski resort."

Surprisingly, Killy finds “the
dry, powder snow of the‘ West-

there can melt, and four or five
days later, it will freeze again
and come back as powder.“

Seeks Social Change

by GLENDA MINSHULL

To persons interested in social problems. NAM is no longer a -

reference to the conflict in South East Asia, but rather the acronym
for the New American Movement (NAM).

Although a national organization to effect social change. NAM
is not a political party. However, it will work within the politi-

’ cal arena by supporting candidates sympathetic to its ideas.

NAM has currently developed a five plank national priority
program, which includes response to President, Nixon‘s new econo-

mic policy.‘ industrial health and safety, ecology and the environ b

ment. child care. and law and order.

Loosely allied chapters have been formed nationwide, and in an
effort to attract a widerange of participants, chapters have been
organized on the basis of locale, place of work, and common interests.

NAM has attracted many‘ feminists who had previously
worked with autonomous women's liberation groups, because NAM
does not view discrimination against women as a separate problem.
but instead sees it as a contributing factor to other social injustic-
es.

NAM approaches the problem by relating women's liberation to

each of the five priorities in the national program. Also, in an effort _

to prevent male domination in the organization, NAM leadership
lS composed equally of men and women.

_ As a multi-racial organization, NAM will deal with racism, like
feminism, in relationship to other problems.

Each local chapter is free to concentrate on the specific prob-
lems found in its area and to develop workable solutions. By shar-
ing their successes and failures with other chapters. NAM locals
hope to find the best methods of improving the system.

NAM has adoptedpthis approach in order to attract participa-
tion repulsed by other radical let'tist move nents. whose “self-pro-
claimed leadership" has prevented group progress.

About 50 people attended the local chapter meeting here Saturday
at Carnegie-Mellon University, where members and others interested

"I had to keep washing my

hair all the time, and it was.

hard to look good every day."

"I would tell myself. it is only
a camera there and a few tech-

‘ nicians, but it was difficult."

Killy also has a new book
out called g“Skiing, the Killy
Way,” geared to “downhillers
and snowplowers alike.”

Despite his varied interests.
there is no doubt in Killy‘s
which comes first- his motto is
"Think Snow."

However, Celli cited the Engi-
neering News Record, which at-
tributes a 17 per cent annual in-
flation rate in the building trade
industry to Pittsburgh. Robert Pa-
ternoster of the City Planning
Commission noted that the one
per cent per month GSA estimate
seemed “reasonable to the city."

Ending the debate, Blum ad-
mitted that the absence of ade-
quate data on the impact of the
wage-price freeze makes any esti-
mate questionable.

But Blum also stressed that the
GSA is extremely anxious for all
parties concerned to reach a
speedy agreement. “We have to
get this thing moving,” he plead-
ed, complaining that there has
been “no sign of substantial pro-
gress.” . i

that point, pressure for a quick ac-
cord should be even stronger.

 

A shortage of coal for the Bellefield Boiler may make late fall and
early winter a bit nippier for the University this year. Two boilers at
the plant, which provides heat for Pitt and other Oakland institutions, '
is being coverted to run on steam. The conversion will be completed in
December.

However, a current shortage‘ of coal will probably force the Uni-
versity to keep temperatures lower than normal until the conversion is
complete. Such _a cut back occurred Friday.

Homecoming Activities -Include  
Contest, Flicks, Game, Concert

Homecoming 1971 is built on the
theme “We Can Be Together.’
Like a good literary theme, it has
many interpetations shown in the
week’s activities.

The kickoff this Wednesday is
We Can Be Together Day.’ It is
an attempt to bring Pittsburgh
businessmen andpstudents togeth-
er. Many local companies have
donated advertising articles to be
distributed on the Cathedral lawn
beginning at n_oon or on the ground
floor of the Cathedral if the weath-
er is bad. — -

Wednesday will also feature
voting for the Pitt Woman at the

ground floor desk in the Cathedral
and the Towers lobby from 10
a.m. until 5 p.m. Major emphasis
has been placed this year on the
candidates’ activities and contri-
butions to Pitt. Five finalists
have been selected by the judges.

On Thursday there will bea

Claims Patronage Immoral   

Peirce °Guilty’ of New Politics

by SUE McDEVITT.

“I've been accused and stand
proudly guilty," declared Robert
Pierce. Clerk of Courts. "of what
has been called ‘new politics.‘ I
believe the patronage system is
immoral and uneconomical."

"Peirce, a candidate for the

Clerk post, spoke Thursday to an 1

English II class.

Denouncing patronage, Peirce
recalled that when he took office.
there were 48 employees. He was
told that to stay in office he should
increase the number of em-
ployees, hiring people who "had
contacts and who would work for
him, and pump the employees for
money when electio_n time came.

“And I guess I could have done

it, he said. ‘But then .a friend of .

mine told me, Peirce, you have an
opportunity to do what you said
you’d do. Dont louse it up by play-
ing patronage. If you win, you win,

Saturday is Game Day when the
Panthers battle against the
Orangemen of Syracuse. ’

After the game, Homecoming
'71 will close with a “triple bill"
featuring Buddy Miles,
Horse. and John Mayall.

Tickets are on sale now at the
Student Union ticket office at $4
per seat. The concert starts at
7:30 p.m. in the Syria Mosque.

In addition ' to the scheduled
events, the quad and student un-
ion are going_to be decorated with
banners for Homecoming.

Crazy.

if you lose, you lose.‘ At least
youll be able to sleep at night.”

‘ Now, Peirce said, his office has
38 employees, not 48. and they
work 40_hour weekslnot -32 like
other county employees. In the
patronage system, he said. the
employees have no protection.
Anytime a new administration
comes in they know they're going
to_ lose their jobs. Patronage, he
concluded should be abolished.

-"The Clerkof Courts shouldn't
even be an elective office,' he con-
tinued. “All the row offices—the
Recorder of Deeds, the Prothona-
tory, the Clerk of Courts—should
be civil service offices. There's a
bill now in the legislature to do
that, and I think it has a good
chance of passing."

Peirce ‘went on to talk about

youth in politics. “I went down to

the Peace and New Priorities Ral-

ly to introduce Pete McCloskey.
There were" 30,000 kids there and
they sat for three hours and lis-
tened to a little bit of music and a
lot of speeches, and behaved a
lot better than I think I would
have. I came away thinking that
there can be a change. I think the
youth vote is going to be critical.”

through his office, Peirce down-

- played his role. - ' '-

I ‘I opened the books, which are‘
supposed to be open to the public,
anyway,” Peirce said. "The pre-
vious Clerk had kept them closed..
I'm told there were 200 police-
men involved in all. Most of them
didn't get very much and some of
them didn't even know they were
getting it. '

“There is, of course, no doubt’7

that the 34 who were prosecuted: 
deserved it,” he continued. “Per- l_
haps 60 days suspension is not

just. But there’s a law that says j
that if a policeman is suspended _
for morethan 60 days he has to '

pass a physical to get back on-the 5.-

force. What if a guy lost an eye .
because he was shot in the line of
duty? So they suspend him for
more than 60 days and. he can’t .
pass the physical and can’t get"
his job back.” .

In conclusion, Peirce argued
that the Police Trial Board sys- ‘
tem is indubitably a bad one. ‘

The Clerk of Courts is a county__:.
administrator responsible for
keeping court records for the civil

division in order. In Allegheny

County, unlike many other coun-V
ties, he is an elected official.

I would certainly move for im-
peachment as well.

My concern is that the students
of this University are not getting
the truth. Certain portions, some
very good. but in other cases.
completely out of context. adulter-
ated. and non-factual.

Last April,the Student Associa-
tion enjoyed a favorable press,
getting coverage on a wide variety
of events and programs. Last
April the Pitt News requested and
received an allocation over $7,-
000 for emergency operating ex-
p_enses.

When it wasdiscovered that the_

full amount would not be needed.

the amount equivalent to Pitt_

News salaries for the Spring and
Summer were recalled. Many
members of the Social Commis-
sion felt 'that_they had -been de-
ceived by an exaggerated request
meant to cover the salariesup.

_ It's kind of like-a nan asking
f'or ten dollars for food. Once he
gets it", he tells you he only need-

. ed six. but he's going” to spend the
other four on.something else, We.

asked for the other four back,and
got it. ' _ ‘ ‘ ' , g -
Not before Editor Bill Gormley,

however, wrote an‘ editorial on_

the huge power play me and the
Social Commission were attempt-
ing. That began the initial encoun-
ter,~with Gormleywriting a front
page, “Unbiased” news story on

the meeting. How hecould have

During the Attica riots. the
press wailed over the white
guards, and called the prisoners
"savages" (New York Daily
News). The media all over the
country. played up the racist
movement in Pontiac and play-
ed down the racial unity at At-
tica. I .
.Example: Banfield‘. in The
Unheavenly City, a common-
used textbook, says, "The low-
er-class individual lives in a

he himself participated directly in
a rather heated discussion. No re-
tractions. No correction of quotes
or otherwise.

More recently. the Student As-
sociation cut $13.000 from the Pitt
News budget. about $3.000 more
than it takes to subsidize the
Homecoming concert. This mon-
ey was going to be used to pay
staff salaries for the Pitt News.

Maybe you don’t realize it, but

$10,000 of ‘your activities fees‘

goes to the Pitt News as advertis-

‘While-you’ve been raising a clam-

sioners whichwere only recom-

News has been paying them

‘ _Mr.- Markus also noted that the nature of the _
product had given him pause (he ‘asked me if I

into University life was outweighted by the precau-_ '
tionary factors he had listed. ' , -
So I-suppose it comes down tovaibalancing test

there is a consensus on this matter, I hope it can be

fights for its own existence and

dents. Instead of a fair. impartial

I’d apprecaite not being judged
before something does‘ or does not

ritatioirof having to explain to
countless students what they are

tion Constitution. I publically. disassociate myself from any students
who feel the unexplainable need to be surreptitious or conspiratorial
when exercising a constitutionally-granted right.

The night I made the matter public. only two of the individuals
mentioned in the Friday article indicated'to me that they felt it was

wrong to behonest about what we were all doing. _
It has been asserted that thosestudents who want a constitu_tional-

v ly-authorized referendum are disrupting student government. But what

is really sought is not the disruption ‘of the constitution that the stu-

dents,’ approved in a campus-wide referendum, ‘but the upholding and -'  ‘
the enforcement of the constitution. I I

a As an alternative to a constitutionally-authorized referendum on
impeachment, it has been suggested that we all just forgetthe whole

thing and work for constitutional change. But what good is any con‘-‘jg. 

stitution that the students approve if they are not permitted to act un-

‘der it? .

It is the duty of every student to work to uphold the constitution. _

the subtle thought with the av-
erage student who doesn't know
whats going on and let him do
your muckraking for you. The in-
sinuation is clear. If money is not
being spent for concerts. then
where‘? The budget I submitted in
June has never been deviated

' from.

I am limited todo ‘one major
concert every month. two free
small concerts per term. and 30
dances per year. I have never
changed that, so where the hell is
the free hand I have. outside of
written in the pages of the Pitt

. ’News.

« -.-  -

 

The paper has also forgotten to
mention the budget procedures
with triplicate signatures of the
business manager, myself, and
my advisor on all contracts or
knowledge thereof. The contracts

are also triplicate with one copy‘

for the school, one for the artist,
and one for the union. __
The process entails going
through four budget controls in
the comptrollers office and final-

ly a University check made out to-

the artist or the agency.

The article finished with . . .
“it is unlikely that Pitt students

' will see much in the way of qual-

ity entertainment.“ Thanks for
judging me in absentia, fellows.
before anything happened. It‘s
made my job a lot easier. I really
appreciate explaining to students

. what the Pitt News can‘t.

The entire ‘Saturday night film
program of the Pangborn Film
Club, is already paid for from stu-
dent’ activities fees. The movies

‘should be done free. Based on

this, I moved that the club be con-
tinued funding, with an addition
from activities fees to cover
film projects and equipment.
Prices have been charged dif-
ferently from what was al-

 

 

ready voted on and films have
been changed as well. An example
of this is the film The Shoot

Horses, Don’t They. Pangborn-

was given $750 to cover the cost
of this movie. The movie was can-
celled and Yellow Submarine in-
serted instead. Last year‘s Win-
ter Weekend Committee paid ap-
proximately $400 in costs for the
film. ‘ «
Because of the cancellation.
Pangborn will make a $350 profit
on the students before they ever
collect a cent at the door, Since my

' motion to do the films free to the

students and also cover Pangborn
for equipment and projects, I have
been under considerable personal

attack by Pat O'Brien. president -

of the club.

The following corrections are
to be noted in his series of arti-
cles which did‘ a hell of a job.in'
destroying credibility and making
the social program a political is-
sue. What I would like to know is
why the Pitt News did not see fit.
to check on O’.Brien’s facts before
it printed his columns:

1. The Homecoming subsidy for
the concert. is $10391, not $15341
as reported. The entire amount
represents $4,950 in other Home-
coming activities. - This permits
us to charge ‘$41 instead of $6 and
$7 for. the concert.

2. Fifteen-hundred dollars was
not cut from the Homecoming
budget to pay for B;S.&T, $1.500
were not additionally allocated by
the Allocations Committee to my _
budget nor any other budget. A
maximum allowance is permited
of $1.5000 on subsidy. This is
-from money made or saved. Fif-
teen hundred dollars, as noted in
the correction in O‘Briens arti-
cle, was not cut from the Home-
coming favors as printed. I do not
enjoy having to explain to the
Homecoming Committe_e_ mem-

motion on the floor toclose de-

further valid information on why
it was necessary to charge for

amount offunding needed for some

David Marshall, coordinator.
of Environment Pittsburgh, an-
nounced at a news conference
Thursday the formation of‘ a
"committee on water pollution
and a citizens’ task force.

The purpose of this project,
he explained, is to insure en-

‘  torcement of state and federal
' . waterway regulations
,- "ing -industrial discha_rges, par— _
 ticularly for Pittsburghs rivers.-

concern-

“Students and faculty will

 take surveys of area waterways,
‘ _. and ‘samples of discharge will
1' be collected and tested," he stated.

According to Marshall, the
campaign has four major ob-

,  jectives-“to obtain information,
  to encourage students to go out-
. A side the university, to make in-

; ‘dustry aware, and to get people
‘ ” involved.”

  5 Ultimately, he said, must

/tznavourys D At‘ Studio Theater

Captivates Audience

’ MARY WELTY

As the lights dimmed to blackness and the handfull of musi-
cians started to play, a small man swept across stage to begin his
first song. Immediately the dynamism of Charles Aznavour caught
the audience in Carnegie Music Hall and drew them into _the song.

"Je Reviens."

Literally, “Je Reviens“ means “I Return,“

and with this en'-

trance the Canadian- songwriter and singer returned to the stage
Saturday evening for another resounding performance.

His songs ranged from a sly little song about a.2irl’s loss of
virginity to a bittersweet tune that reunites young lovers after years
of separation. But it did not matter to the audience whether the

songs were light or heavy.

For some time the singer troubled himself with translation of
every French song, but gradually this became unnecessary. Azna-

vour’s deep voice mixed with

facial expressions and expressive
gestures carried every song.

Perhaps it was an influence
of h-is acting mother and his
singing father or from his acting
childhood in Paris that impell-
edhim to act out his songs. He
did this in "La Boeheme” when

_ he represented the painter from

Montmarte. As he sang, he paint-
ed slowly with the love and care
of the artist.

Then all of a sudden, as
Aznavour’s glance swept the au-
dience, he caught one person’s
eye and sang to her alone.

Aznavour said, “Whenever
I love a women, I have to

write a song about them.”
“Sarah” and “Isabelle” de-
scribed two of his lovers
beautifully.

Aznavour also told the audi-
ence, “I wrote a song about
youth when .I was 18, and later
song on the subject

bined“‘The Wine of Youth"and’

"Yesterday When I Was
Young" to the rousing approval
of young and old alike in the
audience.

Perhaps it was _the smooth-
ness of the French that he
sang, but the music floated
easily out over the audience
throughout the concert. An ex-
ample of this wa's “To My
Daughter,” a song he com-
posed two days after her birth
24 years ago.

reacted

And the audience ,

strongly to his agility and drama. .

They were startled when inter-
mission arrived, and they beg-
ged him for an encore at the
end. '

' His choice of songs about love

of life and love of -people con- V

veyed his philosophy of living.
His performance on stage capti-
vated everyone there.

F1'y’s °Phoenix’ Rises ~  

by LOIS LEVINSON
Drama Staff

The Phoenix was a beautiful. mythical bird
that was voluntarily consumed by fire and arose
again to life from_ its own ashes as a glowing
symbol of immortality.

In Christopher Fry‘s Phoenix too Frequent,
a modern adaptation of an Egyptian legend now
playing at the Studio Theater, life and death
fight a farcical battle with love as their insti-
gator. ‘

Dynamene, a lovely young women, condemns
herself to starve in her dead husbandfs tomb
so she can join him in Hades. Her servant,
Doto, resignedly accompanies her.

Grief prevails until a handsome soldier, Teg-
eus, entersthe tomb and begs her to give him her
love so as to make them immortal. He woos Dyna-
mene. from the arms of death into his arms that
promise life.

Fry's" characterizations are amusing and per-
suasive. Dynamene is all softness and fantasy and
deaths own public relations expert. Te-
geus is strong and real with his physicality firm-
ly rooted in life. The Greeks had a chorus to voice
the author’s opinion, or act as a pivot for the
main characters, and Fry has Doto, who adapts
to any situation with little ceremony.’ ‘

While Tegeus and Dynamene speak of the
lovely poetic images wine conjures up, Doto
is reminded only of grapes. The characters run
rampant with rationalizations and the dialogue
is witty enough to carry it off.

.- All the play’s good elements, however, don’t
take "it beyond amusing entertainment. Though
there is some truth, there is no greatness.
Tegeus’ and Dynamenefs battle is fun—but con-
stantly predictable. ‘

Even in the end, when Dynamene uses her

‘former, husband’s. body as a switch-hitter to re-

sic to Western audiences. How-
ever. he has a strong belief that
there are also certain things that
the listeners must do.

“They must be aware of certain
points,” he said, as he rubbed his
calloused hands, “They must re-
member this is not pop/rock mu-
sic. Not to knock this kind of mu-
sic, but listening attitudes just
aren't the same. Mine is like
classical music, and it is very
pure. We must bring this out.” .

The master musician then ad-
mitted he knew many young peo-
ple attended‘ his‘ concerts under
theinfluence ofyarious drugs. but
he also showed that this disap-
pointed him. i , ’

"Many kids-are high when they
come to hear me..This brings bad
vibes and .nakes it hard for me to
give my best. I like people to get

’ high, on my music, and I feel

cheated when I look across an au-

. dience and see’ a lot of glassy-A

eyed,_freaks." .

Not only is Shankar highly re-
garded by countrymen and fellow
musicians for his sitar work, but
his talents as an educatorare

also widely respected. He real-I
izes that many of his listeners in‘

the West do not understand the
‘rhythms and purposes behind his
music. ‘ ' -

So during each concert he at-
tempts to cultivate understanding
as well as pleasure-

"I am not really trying, to teach

sic and fill with them with spirit-

provides the familiar drone in In-

played his talents as an accom-

the beautiful teakwood sitar he
was playing was completely hand-
made by him.

The troupe began the program
with an afternoon and evening
raga and by the time Alla Rakha

was well into a tabla solo, the‘au--

Following the spiritual. inel-

melody. In a dhun. the artist re-
turns to a recurring theme af-

regional tunes that come to his
mind at that moment.

Shankar and,Rakha built the

he still has room to demonstrate

llllllllllllIllllIIIIllllIlllllllllllllllllIlllllllllllllIllllllll

In the course of‘ a sunny afternoon in Newton. Massa-
chusetts the Pittsburgh Panthers found a quarterback and may
have_lost a season. I

Coach Carl DePasqua informed sophomore Bob Medwid,
as the McKees Rocks native boarded the bus enroute from
the .\/Iarriott Hotel to BC‘s Alumni Stadium, that he would be
the starting quarterback in the Panther, Eagle clash that after-
noon. Medwid was not surprised. DePasqua was going to try
the power I formation.

“When we were practicing, I was the power-I quarter-

" back," related Medwid after the crushing loss at the hands of

Boston College. The six foot two and a half quarterback sat
stretched out with a severely bruised hand resting on his

» thigh. (“Somebody stepped on it‘_‘). He certainly didn’t look

like he had just completed his first college starting assign-
ment. ,
r “I think I did fairly well out there today,” he offered.‘
“I’ve had the confidence all season. All I needed was a
chance to start.” i‘ -- .-

Veteranlquarterback Dave Havern 

if Medwid continues to run the squad
»efficie’r_itly.' Havern spent the after-
noon on the sidelines aiding the coach-
es with observations and communicat-
ing with the spotters via-headphones ..
on the field. 2

“He moved the team,’-” Havern '
commented after the contest was .;_
over.” He did a good job. I’d have put ’
him in there.”,

Coach "DePasqua was also’ very
satisfied with Medwid’s performance.

— BOB MEDWID

.He spoke of the power-I as a “control type offense. I was very

satisfied with it.” _ _

Eagles soared passed the error-

the third quarter the game was

Panthers fumbles and a defens-

‘jiéagé l0—THE PITT NEWS—Monday, October 25, 1971

  l\Iissed Shot DeniesBot Very

The melee resulted from the
refs call of awarding Pitt a pen-
alty kick. the ultimate in good for-
tune for a soccer team. Eraldo
Mattei, an overaged junior for the
Vikings at 33, displayed his rau-
cous temperment, as CSU fans
along the sidelines added their
biased views. I

The argument between the CSU
team and the ref though lengthy
and loud, did not mean much in
the end anyhow. Denny Kohlmyer,
who attempted the penalty shot
which could have meant victory
for the booters, missed the goal
completely. His line drive shot
sailed high and way off to the left
of the goal.

,"‘Denny has kicked them for us
in the past." explained Pitt Coach
Leo Bemis. “It is just one of
those things, if the ball is hit well.
it usually goes in unless the goalie
makes a good play." .

Matteis’ action ‘was indica-
tive of the entire Viking squad
throughout the contest. CSU’s
coach, William Clarke. ' provided
verbal entertainment for the
sparse crowd at the Stadium as
he battled the refs constantly.

Although each team scored just
one goal, both missed many op-
tunities of ramming in another.
At least one shot by each team
was deflected by‘ the goal post,
and both goalies, Pitt’s John
White and CSU’s Horst Hotzy,
stopped many fine attempts.

' White, regularly a forward for
Bemis’ squad, manned the nets
due to an injury to top goaltender
Steve Fibel.

The one shot that got by White
was actually not his. fault, ac-
cording to Bemis. Midway
through the second period, Viking
Jim McMillan deflected a pass

with his head that angled into the
far corner of the Pitt net.

The booter’s defense allowed
McMillan to take the pass uncon-
tested, and White was beaten. Af-
ter the game, John explained that
“I was helping to set up the wall
on one side because of the direct
pass, but no one covered the men
in the middle.”

Joe Luxbacher knottedthe score
in the thirdperiod as he headed a
corner kick pass from Chucho
Valencia into the net. Luxbacher,
the tallest of the booter forwards,’
timed his jump perfectly and lin-

‘ed the ball past the outstretched

reach of CSU‘s Holtzy.

The hard fought contest earned
the Pitt booters a tie, giving them

.a very respectable 5-1-2 record.

Bemis concedes though that
''We‘ll need good showings in our
next couple games to be consider-
ed for the NCAA playoffs.“ '

curred, but the officials gave the
ball to the Eagles.

As the Panthers began to march
moments later, disaster struck
again. Joel Klimek grabbed an
eight yard pass over the middle
from Medwid, then fumbled
the ball. Again the call was a
controversial one.

“I caught the ball and I was
running. backward when I felt
one guy hit me,“ said Klimek.
"A second guy came up and
stopped me. I don‘t know
whether there was a whistle or
not but a third guy came right

-into my elbow with his head

and knocked the ball loose."

“His forward momentum was
stopped,” said DePasqua, re-
ferring to Klimek. “But the ref
didn't have the guts to blow
the whistle. He waited for the
other guy to make the call.”

The Eagles jumped on the
chance to ice it, scoring on 11
plays to make the score 40-22.
By the time Dave Havern came
in to try to salvage some of the
wreckage the clock ticked away
any hope the Cats still had. A .

To Fraternity Crown

Phi Gamma Delta. (Fiji). captured the 1971 intramural frater-
nity division softball championship by defeating Delta Sigma Phi.

7-1, Saturday.

The Fiji batters had a field day by racking up thirteen hits.
including two home runs at Trees Field.

The Fijis broke into the scoring column in the fourth inning
as three runners crossed home plate. In the fifth. the Fiji's push-

ed four more runs home with an
explosive offensive spurt. Dave

Krugh led off the inning with a’

double. Paul Kalinsky rapped a
base hit and Krugh held third
base.

to key players, Quinter did ex-
pect Kent State to provide stiff
competition for his team.

"I anticipated their playing
an aggressive game and they
did," commented the Cub coach.

The Golden Flashes continu-
ed to go after the Pitt freshman
as Keith Vinez booted a 27 yard

field goal early in the third
quarter.
But, with only two minutes

remaining in the contest, the
Cubs recaptured the lead on a
64 yard run by Daniels which
plunged the Cubs to the KSU
15 yard line. — l ‘

On a pitch-out to Ed Brennan,
the Pitt squad racked up their
second touchdown and again
connected for a two-point
conversion. Daniels to Don
Siegle, giving them a 16-10

victory—their first win of the_

season against two losses to
Penn State and West Virginia.

Quinter was not particularly
impressed by the overall per-
formance of his team this year.

"I thought that we could have
won the Penn State game and
that we could have
better in the West
game." he stated.

“We haven’t had any offense
that can ‘move the ball. The
quarterbacks . really haven’t
played well until the second
half of the Penn State game and
the last quarter of thisjgame.

“Looking back I guess I
would have done the same

Virginia

things; under the same circum-

stances I would have played the
same way." '

Bill Hull smacked the first
Fiji four bagger driving in Krugh
and Kalinsky. With two out,
Pete Antinopoulis clouted the sec-
ond Fiji home run.

Delta .Sigma Phi retaliated

-with their lone run in the. sixth,

but Fiji hurler Barry Sicard
yielded only three hits to hold
the Delta Sigs at bay.

Bill Hull, Carl Luft, and
Pete Antinopoulis led the Phi
Gams at the plate. as Hull
stroked a home run and two
singles for three RBI’s while
Antinopoulis had a home run
and a single and Luft banged
out three singles.

The intramural softball play-
offs will continue this week with
the champions from the Inde-
pendents meeting the Engin-
eers and the winners of the Dor-
mitories playing the Grand-Fac
League champs.

The Fijis will then meet the
winners of the Independents-
Engineers contest in the semi-
finals.

Country schedule last week to travel to Lake Pla-‘

tive to the.Amateur Athletic Union.

Besides fulfilling his representative role. Ban-
ner turned the trip into ‘a fact finding one. Al-
though the track season is still two months
away and the ‘72 Olympics are even farther.
Banner believes that at least five of his track ath-

'letes have a chance to qualify for the Olympic

Trials and wanted to clear away any doubt Con, ...
cerning trial requirements.

.According to Banner. Bill Rea. in the long
triple jumps, Dorel Watley and- Ken.Silay in the
half mile. Mike Schurko in the steeplechase.
and Dan Kouvolo in the javelin throw have the
potential to meet both the AAU and the Olympic
trial requirements for their respective special-
ties, which could lead them to the,1972 Olympics
in Berlin, Germany.

It seems hard to foresee five Pitt track ath-
letes in the German Olympics, but Banner con-
cedes that with a little luck anything could
happen.

“Luck has to be with you along with the con-
ditioning and the ability." Banner said.’ "but I
believe that they have the competitiveness and
the talent to do it.“

Banners beliefs have been born out. by the
past performances of his hopefuls. Both Watley
and Silay have shown that they have the means
to qualify in the half mile. Watley ran close
to Smitty Brown on several occasions last year:
while Silay led the relay teams. Both seem cap-
able of ‘achieving the qualifying time of 48.3.

Kouvolo has pampered his Olympic future
for some time and his long javelin heaves of
