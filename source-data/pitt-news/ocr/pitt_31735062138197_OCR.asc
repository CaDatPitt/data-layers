It so ‘often happens that on an oc- »

 .:‘.—dications_ point to a bitter struggle,
 -ﬂ  game really proves a farce
f U"~=".n_'n’dt'one side is overwhelmingly vic-

- " " armony with the  setting. Two
 football teams, ﬁghting to the

7-bands of drooters. Neither team has
' giver before.‘-‘played to amore spirited
cifowd, nor has eitherteam ever en-
gaged in a more bitter contest.
From the very start, Pitt was the
aggressor, the ‘great Panther backs

Talent of ~Many. Students

'Displayed in ' “Warrior’s
' Return.” Staff Begins Work
on Christmas Issue.

“Oh, you wretch! Don’t push me
about that way,” cried a fair co—ed to
a “Bunch of Green” trying to grab a
P_itt Panther before she could.
“Howdya_getthatway?” snarled 3
husky Sophomore. “Forget that prep
school stuﬁ. Women are ﬁrst around
here.”

“Oh, say; oh dearah, I have lost
my Panther subscription receipt,”
chirped a “Freshboid” from the jun-
gles of Cucumberville to the.*one in
charge- of issuing the Panthers. “Qh,
what shall I do‘?”_ ' .

Such were the remarks heard when
the “Panther” was distributed last
Thursday in State and Thaw ‘halls.
A rush was made and it was first
thought that there would not be a
sufficient number to go around.‘ Thus
the “Panther” was received with en-
thusiasm by every Pittite about the
_campus. * ’

The cover drawn by Edward Lewib‘.
art editor, met with the approval of
all students who appreciate art.

The talents of many students were
displayed in the “Warrior’s Return"
number. The wit and humor contain-
ed within the leaves, shows a revival
of what the “Panther” was in the past.

The members of the staff under the
direction of Manager Frank B. Max
field and Editor. Richard A. Love, '20.
are now at work on the next issue,’
which will be the Christmas number.

All Pittites are urged to. co-0D‘31'at9
with the staff in making the next is-
sue the best one ever published.

Also those who have not subscribed

are requested to do soatonce.

“S_milin’ Through,’’ a fantastic coni-
edy in three act-'s'by’ Allen Langdon
Martin, in which the Selwyns will pre-
,sent Miss Jane  at the Pitt Thea-
ter next week, suggests __all. sorts of
delightful possibilities. -In the ﬂrst
place it is announced that’*Misse:.;.:Cow1
will play a dual role which aﬁords her
opportunity to’a'ppear' in the "hoop-

in.the costumes of the present hour,
which her rare beauty can but grace.
In addition to this we aretold that.
the scene of the play, _'Which has been
designed by Joseph Urban, isthat of
anlilnglish garden seen during the ac-
tion of the play as it was 50 years ago,
and again as it is'~today, all of which
gives’ promise of;a whims-icality that
» is unique_._ _ . *
‘ “Sm'ilin’ Th-rough" brings a tender.
optimistic message to the world, which
should be singularly appealing in these
stressful days of universal unrest, and
.for its presentation Miss Cowlwill be
V surrounded by a cast of distinguished
_- piayers, including several who have for
. some years formed the nucleus of her
permanent act-in-g organization. ,_ Of

’ ing man, Henry Stephenson, who is
well-re-niVem,b'ered for ‘his’ impersona-
tion of the Major in “Lilac Time” -and
other Vsplendidly played roles. Others

Charlotte _Gra.nville, ‘Ealinej II1eSCOlH"t,
Philip Tonge ‘ and Marion Bertram.

doubtedly the most notable dancing.

“institution” is used advisedly, for it

as Miss Morgan, with her school of

 “They’ll neverTbea;tl Pitt now,” was

and tho..opinion, of, many. ;'l;he._.mp-
ment thatjthe ‘I,:ed..and black tide was

ment did tlreyusee defeat staring them

this initial quarter _w_Vfas one} Q; 'th‘ej

team in ‘defence of their goal. A line
which. was a_V.cknowledged'to -be much

the inferior in strength and battered

horde from the la-st]'cl1alked Vmark———
the onewhich meant victory. ’ ', l
‘ A question was in the._minds.oVf
many ,when the Panthers took the
ﬁeld. . It was, T “Who will play left
end?” They soon found out, how-
ever-——it was Eckert. Eckert had
never started a big game before,‘ and
while he didn’t star, he played a. good
game when it is considered that he
was playing against a. man who will
be one of the two All—Ame-rican‘ ter-
minals this season; Carroll -is byfar
the best end that has -been seen here
this year. ,Give Eckert credit. . _

The name of one lad is on the lips
of every one -who witnessed VSa.tur-’
day’s battle. “Speedo” Laughran was
the lad ‘who came through at the
psychological moment. ‘And he multi—.
plied them.V "Speedo. did everything,
from running theends and diving: off
tackle to bucking. theiline- And, was
be successful? He was. He inserted
the sense in sensation. He-was the
dark horse of Saturday’-s" fray, Pops
fooler, as it were_. What the Red and-
Black fexpected from Davies they got
from Laughran.

‘ Davies, stalking Horse.

Tom was the stalking horse. And,"
he certainly acted his part well. That
triple/Q pass with Laughr’anT on i the
carrying. end completely-;fooled_, the
 ’& J. eleven, and the speed boy
tripped, off several dandy runs. But,
_we cannot forget that aerial toss that
went hurtling ‘through . the air, and
Xﬁnally nestled in the arms of Laugh-
ran, just a few yardsZfrom_ the ob-
jective‘ —po.int——~the Wash‘-Jeff goal‘ line.
It was one of the most thrilling and
also oneof the most daring: attempts
for a score that have ever been seen
here or anywhere. And’ the fact that
it failed to count, because of the tack-
ling of the-runner does not take from
it one bit of its glamour. It was
Davies to Laug ran. And the forward
itself waspret y———-but ; better yet, it
was satisfying-—-as it arrived—T—safe in
the waiting handsof Speedo. _.

And we must not forget the cool and‘
nervy blocking and defensive work of.
McCracken, who was acting as qua!‘-
terback’. _’I-Ierb’ ’ went into the batVtleV
with a broken nose, tied.uP in Splints.

Meanor and Bond a.re.- better every
game. The return of Dode Thomas in
the VWash-Jeff game is -very encourag-
ing, and it is likely that Marvis will:
be able to get into the battle at his
old tackle position. The _ends are
showing more form as -the‘Vsea.son‘ de-

opposition in the Penn game. as in; last

-Dehart and Davies at the halves, Mc-
‘Cracken at quarter and Hastings .-at

on -any football team in the country.
In case Capt. Jimmy is : unable. to’
stand the siege he has an able lieu-
tenant in Speedo Laughran. His work
in the game last Saturday will always

lower. The manner in which he was
able to worm his way _ through the
P_reside,nts for the long runs which he
registered has placed -him on the par
squad. S .

though, he carries the- ball very_-little,
he is one of the best ba.cks on‘ inter-
ference that Pitt has -ever had..He.a1so

makes it look as if his presence in the
lineup strengthens the backﬁeld.

T As" for Hastings and Davies‘ their
ability is alreadyan established factor
on the varsity. TAndy, looked good in

Enthused by the recent successes
