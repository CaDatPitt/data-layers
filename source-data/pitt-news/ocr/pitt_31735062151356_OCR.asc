HOOVERMRETES 
To COLLEGE MEN

C

To the. college men of America I
address myself with conﬁdence, a con-
ﬁdence born ‘of unforgettable experi-
‘ence. ‘ . 

In the‘ relief of Belgium, most ‘of
the actualworleof the:C«ommissio\n in

..*I~:a¢h.. »_

The report included recommenda'ti‘ons
made to the authorities.for -thebeit-_‘
terment of the Department of‘4Mil-
itary Science and the mitigation of
the discontent among the students.
The recommendations were: - ' ‘

I. Government recognition with
the establishment of a» Reserve _Of—
ﬁcers’ Training Corps at Pitt.

_II. Officers with real experience

direct the drill of Pitt men.

III. Tha't the armory be secured
as‘ a. suitable place for indoor drill
during the inclement weather.

IV. That there be a uniform drill
hour in the middle of the day _at.
which time all the men in school take
their drill. 4 .1 —

V. A change in uniform to take
effect with the next incoming class
and continue until the new type be-.‘
came the «prevailingstyle. _ - b V

The report further showed that
these rcgcommendations were‘-adopted
in their entirety. The Chancellor and
his associates were shown to be mak-
ing every. effort to “secure the ﬁrst
three requirements and made the
statement that" something deﬁnite‘

The ‘fourth proposition wastaken up
and it was decipded that the inornintg

~THE PITT eVY_rEEK~LY’S PAGE or SPORTS "

Blue and Gold Down
‘ Plaid Cage Men 41-30

‘Skibos No Match for Flint’s

Fast-Flying Quintet at Trees
Gym. ‘

By a garrison ﬁnish, Pitt’s ‘big ﬁve
won a satisfying victory over the
Skibos from across -the hollow at

,Trees Gym Friday evening. The

-1,.

Techites’ play was fast and cosasistent
enough to warrant a victory at almost
-any time, in fact they were -in the
lead at the end of the first half 11-10.
But in the second half Pitt\came back

and playedva whirlwind game, marked
by wonderful teamwork and spectacu-
lar shooting, especially on the part of‘

Harry Levine. .»In this half Pitt scored

31 points. 9‘ '
Each team was weakened by the
absence of a star, Pitt through the

— expulsion of Pearlman and Tech by

_— .

the inability of Levinson, due to in-
jury. Pearlman’s place at center was
ﬁlled by Nicolas, who ﬁgured promi-
nently in Pitt’s teamwork, besides s-cor-
ing a ﬁeld goal and outjumping Gretz-
ler. George McLaren played a great
guarding game against Lefty Abrams,
Tech’s ﬂashy captain and helrl the
Pl-aid leader scoreless until almost the
end of the game. E~asterday’s efforts
were likewise instrumental in gaining
the victory. But the bright feature of
the game -was the masterpiece offered
by Levine and Penman. Each of the
Pitt forwards scored a half dozen
ﬁeld goals, almost all of them in the
second half. The Tech guards took
Pitt dust in large quantities, for they
couldn't keep the pace set by the best
-pair of forwards the Blue and Gold
had had in quite a while. Besides his
ﬂoor game, Penman was successful in
14 out of 17 tries from the foul line
and Levine made good on his only
try at the free toss.

The school rivalry, so srong be-'
tween Pitt and Tech, helped make the
game the snappiest affair so far this
season. ,Both teams played at top
speed and a defeat for either team
would have been no disgrace. Pitt
was enjoying a ﬁeld day and‘Penm-an
and Levine were playing in form with

the best of them. ‘

In the preliminary to the big teams’
game, the Pitt Freshmen ‘beat the
Tech Plebes 28 to 24. The Plebes, as
their big brothers, were in the lead
at the end of the ﬁrst half, but had
relinquished it by the end of the game.
Pitt was obliged to play without its
forward and captain, Silberstein, who
has been suspended on‘-account of

participation in outside contests. Ross ,

took the captain's place and held up"
his end-well. Breman and Kelley
were the stars for the Pantherettes,
both in scoring and ﬂoor work. Kel-
ley at forward is working up a big
-total at ﬁeld goals, adding four to his
list Friday night. He took Silber-
stein’s place at foul shooting and reg-
istered eight ringers out of ten tries.

WIN AGAIN 26-1 2

The girls came through with their
usual win in Saturday’s contest with
the Geneva College girls. The score
was 26-12, which was likewise the
usual «thing, for the girls always salt
away their games with a goodly score
to their credit.

SIERsTEIl\I

PEARLMAN AND
SILBERSTIEIN our

 

Pi

Pearlman and Silverstein have been .

disqualiﬁed from further competition
in athleti-cs on Blue and Gold ath-
letic teams. The disqualiﬁcation came
as the result of games that were
played by the _men as members of
professional basketball aggregations.

Pearlman is known in Pitt athletic
circles chieﬂy for his connection with‘
Warner's championship team of this
year. His performance on the grid
team was of the highest character, but
the ‘‘lure’’ that has downed so many
promising amateurs got the better‘-of ,
him and his suspension came as the
result of his paid activities. Silv‘er-
stein was less widely known in ‘the
University and his absence will not
be felt as much as will that of Pearl-
man, though there ar-e good men to
ﬁll the places of thevabsente s.-

The action of the Pitt authorities
is in absolute accord with. the spirit
of University athletics. The sooner
men arrive at the conclusion that it
is impossible for them to get away
with "such unsportsmanlike actions
the better it will be for amateur ath-
letics in general.»

The main thing is, however, that
the spirit of the Pitt eligibility rules
is being rigidly maintained in. every
case and at any cost.

FRESHMENY WIN
FROM PLEBES

In a fast preliminary game -played
Friday evening the Pitt Freshmen
scored a 28-24 victory over the Tech
Plebes. The ﬁrst-year game was the
feature of the evening in the point of
closeness of score. -

As in the game with Indiana las.t
week the yearlings gave evidence of a
great deal of speedy work. Kelly was
the outstanding performer of the
evening. His work from the forward
position was of the highest type and»
he gives promise of becoming real
material for Flint’s squad in the com-
ing year. His foul shooting was es-
pecially noteworthy. The score:

 

Pitt Fresh 28. Tech Plebs 24.

Eric Meadows, once a quarterback
for the Blue and Gold gridders,«svailed
for France last week. Meadows was
a member of the Naval Reserve and
has been stationed at Philadelphia
since early last fall.

 

It has been suggested that the Uni-
versity start a rogues’ gallery for the
men who make themselves ineligible
for athletics by reason of their pro-
fessional activities. Ring up the pic-
tures oflPearlman and Silverstein be-

side those of Langdon and Kennedy.‘

LOOKIN’ ’EM OVER

Another brace of victories, making
a total of four straight wins.

 

The Pitt girls secured a win over
the visitors from Geneva Saturday
afternoon. This team ,-of girls has
represented the University for the
past three years and during that time
they have not suffered a single de-
feat. A very small attendance was
reported- for Saturday’s game and the
girls are desirous of a better turnout
for tthe next game.

 SPEEDSTERSﬁEasterday’s Men Make Pil-

HAVE coon CARD

The University of Pittsburgh track
team will have a dual meet with the

 

Annapolis Naval Academy team at
Annapolis May 11, the arrangements
being closed last week by Manager
John R. B. Byers. This is the first
track meet ever held with the Mid-
dies, and is bound to add -interest to
the track activities and also to give
Pitt increased standing in the sport
in the East. It also adds the needed
class to the track schedule, now that
the _usual dual. meets with Syracuse
and Penn State have been called off
by those institutions, due to war con-
ditions. The candidates will work all
the harder under Coach Kﬁr and
Catain Sutherland to get in shape
for the season. ,

Other events which are sure on the
schedule ‘are the sending of a team to
the Penn relays; an indoor meet with
the Westinghouse club, February 13;
anpoutdoor -‘dual meet with Carnegie
Tech and the twelfth annual inter-
collegiate and interscholalstic “meet
held by the University on the Schen-
ley oval. The Westinghouse meet is
next on the program and the? Pitt
‘boys are getting in shape for it. As
this is not a college competition, the
Pitt freshmen are permitted to
‘compete, as well as the upper class-
men. This will enable several prom-
ising ﬁrst-year performers to make
their debut.

The track men are urged to be out
every day for practice. There is
really very little time to prepare for
the Westinghouse meet for exams are
coming and this will interfere with
practice to some extent. Roll‘i—s be-
lfllg taken every day and attendance
will be a factor in selecting the men
to represent the Blue and Gold at the

grimage to Morgantown for
Game Friday.

 

The Panther ﬁve makes its first trip
Friday to meet West Virginia at
Morgantown. The ﬂoor men have
been going nicely lately and will be
content with nothing else than an-
other victory from the Mountaineers.
However, in order to accomplish this.
they will have to go ‘some. The game

ago was no soft snap for Pitt, though
we won by a ten-point margin, but

lads are a different proposition. And
it is Pitt’s first game away from
home.  - ’
This will be only the second game
of basketball Pitt has played at Mor-
gantown. The other game played in
the dim and distant past was won by
the Panthers only after a desperate
struggle. West Virginia is noted for
the battles she puts up on her home
groun-ds. She almost put the crimp
on Pitt’s championship aspirations in
football in the opening game of the
1917 season at‘Morgan.town, and this
will be their opportunity to nick up
Pitt’s clean record in basketball thus
far. ,
The squad will include nine players,

They will leave at 8:30 Friday morn-
ing. The lineup which started the
Tech game will likely start against
West Virginia, but Coach Flint has
not deﬁnitely decided upon this yet.

Westinghouse Club.

Frank Shea added another record
to his string by lowering the ‘mark
for three laps indoor. Shea will be
depended upon for most of the work
the coming season. He has showed.
his ability and his feat-s during the
past summer stamps him as one of
the best track men ever produced in
college ranks. A

their services. And those that were

~ chosen performed their duties, not

 only effectively, but with a. spirit ._of
 ...devo.tio1i that made theiriservice be-
~ Kyond praise. They combined idealism

and efﬁciency. It is the combination

that moves the world forward.
 _Today all the young college men of

7 America face a special responsibility

 and duty. '.At no time in the,world’s
_ history ..has‘.the technically‘-' trained

%m_ind been at a higher premium. And
,if,th_is need for it and deiiiandon it will

7.A‘c-_ont:inue after the war is over. Hence,
the gyounxg man in college is faced

with a serious roblem. He must
ask himself: Is the immediate need

i : of lme_V.by my country in‘ my present‘
 svt'ag'é of training “greater than this
 irneed will be later,. and when I. have

-gacquired a‘ higher training‘? This is

Tiiafquesti-on the clear ans-wer to which
A cannot be indicated for all by a single

—.forrnula, because the young men‘ in

college ﬁnd themselves under vary-
ing ciscumstances. Yet an answer in
}‘general.- terms of some helpfulness
Exriay-* be-made. ’ .

‘ ‘V T04 ’'the_ -younger men,. the lower
1' s's_rne,"n, only beginning their _p.ro-

 your college work. If the war .

iﬁed to ﬁll the need then.‘ if the

__ , ends soon,’,there will stillibeur-4
gen-ti need‘ for your help in the neces-

jsary greatw-ork' of reconstruction and

v'rehabilitat'ion. . The more advanced
your training, the more mature your

 « judgment, the more valuable you will
‘ i’ -be. Sotry to ‘possess’ yourself in pa-
.’ 1 tience and‘"stick to your college work.

 To the upper classmen, Iiwould say:
%_PIjI»old yourself ready to respond to
your -,,country’s present’ need at ‘any
‘moment. Where you see your way
-clear’ to make your training useful, do
‘»not.hesita.te ‘to follow ‘the way. But
. you, ito‘o,_ should remember that every
‘_i'additional month or semester ofitrain-
‘wing-will make,Vyou a more effective

much that you can do right now.

I would call your attention to just
one of. the many ways in which you
can help, -and help imortantly. It"is
the way to insuring --the absolutely
‘necessary food supply to ourselves,
and to our Allies. ‘ A ' A

Especially must--the rnat-te"r_~of the

W--food supply of_ our Allies’ beistressed.
The vital world‘ problem -of food is

not generally understood. The popu-
lar view is too -self-cenztered, too self-
_ish—-to use an ugly word. It; does not
look across, the sea. The back-wash
of Europe’s‘misery does not carry to
our «shores. -We do not know, and
hence cannot feel, the pangs of hun-
ger, and. pain of hunger weakness that
are everywhere’ in Europe. They are
pains felt by-our Allies as well as by
our «foes. ‘We must make this known
to all our people, that all our people
may understgandnthe great .and indis-
pensable and immediate role'\they
must play in this all-important part
of the war situation. A You, who‘ can
readily ‘understand must_ help;

.You can ' impress on. the people
around you, and whereveriyoiu go, the
fact that the «critical phase of the
world’ food problem is ‘now, not the

question of high or low prices, but

the quesjtion of producing and saving
and sending enough food to our Al-
lies to keep them alive and strong’ and
The critical ques-
tionnow in «this war‘ is the question
of the actual physical strength of the
ﬁghting nations. V A '

 The United.States Food Admih-' _
istrationt calls youtq, its services‘

peal to.‘ you, to prepare yourselves
as bestyou can, and to enlist for
the great work that must ,_be done.
There will Abeidiversity of tasks,
and therefore diversity of talent
and training can be used. "All our
questions now centejr in food; its
production,. its distribution, its use,
its conservation. The more you
know about these things the mo.
valuable you will be_,_ and the -
greater will he your service to
humanity. ' .
If you have no-t already done so,
we urge you to pursue ‘ studies
-dealing especially. with food, but
these should be reinforced by .
courses in 'chemistry, physiology
and economics. It will be‘ well,
too, if you have acquired the arts
“of” -public presentation ‘of your
knowledge to the pegple who so
much need "it. ’
Fortunately most of our ‘educa-
tional institutions _ now. oﬁer
courses which give the necessary
training for this work, but to the
others an appeal’ is being sent to
provide such instruction’ wherever
it is possible. -  *
More detailed suggestions and
directionsiwill be. published soon.
Today your country asks you to
resolve to do what you can inithis
