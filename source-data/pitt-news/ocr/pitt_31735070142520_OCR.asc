Chancellor addresses pending bill

Trustees < 1

“The University believes that the land is well-
suited for additional undergraduate student
apartments,” Executive Vice Chancellorjerome
Cochran said inanews release. “We are conduct-
ing zoning and design studies to advance the
necessary planning for the project.”

The committee also approved the construc-
tion of a new $5.42 million dormitory at Pitt’s
Bradford campus andanew $9.66 million ﬁtness
center at thejohnstown campus. C

The announcement of the construction
projects came after a full board meeting in the
William Pitt Union Friday morning.

Members of the Board of Trustees met for
about two hours Friday. Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg spent part of the meeting describing
what he called “good news” for the University.
Pitt’s main campus reported accepting its “best—
qualiﬁed” freshman class, with 50 percent of in-
comingfreshmen ranking in the top 10 percent
of their high school classes. In 1995, 19 percent
of incomingfreshmen were in the top 10 percent
of their classes.

For the ﬁrst time, the Bradford campus en-
rolled more than 1,500 students. . ,

Nordenberg also discussed what he called
the University’s biggest challenges within the
last three weeks: the G—20 Summit, H1N1 and

SB1036. Hesaid little during the meeting about‘
- the Summit, except that visits from Russian

President Dmitry Medvedev and president of
the EU European Commission, José Manuel
Barroso, “did bring very positive attention to
the University.” '

He didn’t mention H1N1 again, instead
choosing to focus on SB1036, a state bill that
will determine how much money Pittwill receive
in appropriations. The bill passed through the
state Senate and is now in the state House of
Representatives. .

Nordenberg described the billas “one of sev-
eral bills that essentially are beingheld hostage
 the House as wrangling over positions
 continues.”

He said that because Pitt is a state—related
university, it is classiﬁed as a non—preferred in-
stitution, meaning that more legislators must
approve appropriations for Pitt than for other
institutions.

' “When you think about the way most Penn-
sylvanians would rank their own priorities, the
term non—preferred seems misplaced in this
context,” Nordenberg said. '

He then referred to a slide with a quote from
Otto von Bismarck, a German chancellor in the
late 1800s. '

“Laws are like sausages,” the slide read. “It is
better not to see them being made.”

Nordenberg added, “Four months into the
ﬁscal year, one might say it’s just not clear if
Pemisylvania has a ﬁinctioning ﬁscal system.”

After the meeting, Nordenberg responded ,

to questions about the Summit.

During students’ court hearings, city police
Lt. Ed Trapp testiﬁed that officers arrested peo-
pleon the Cathedral of Learning lawnbecause
Pitt police chief Tim Delaney told him campus
police didn’twant anyone on University property
the Thursday night before the Summit. Trapp
said he hadn’t spoken with Delaney about plans
for the next night and that, “My understanding
was that it would be the same Friday nigh ”

Nordenberg said, “If in fact there was any
such direcﬁon from the University, that would
have beenasurprise to me.” ‘

He added that the Pitt police, whether it

' was Delaney or members ofhis command staff,

headed much of the security coordination for
the Summit with city police,.with whom they
had “fairly regular conta ” ‘
Nordenberg said he was in Oakland during
the Sumrnit—related demonstrations, during

A which about 50 Pitt students were arrested. He

said he communicated with Delaney through
phone the nights of the demonstrations and that
he chose not to interfere with arrests because he
thought they were a “law enforcement issue.”

Still, he added, “We have a nice, peaceful,
welcoming campus, so the idea of arrests occur-
ring on campus was a troubling image.”

Nordenberg said he would have changed
a few aspects of the University’s approach to
the Summit. He said it might have helped to
use the University’s Emergency Notiﬁcation
System the Thursday night before the Summit
and that “it might well have been a good idea if
the ofﬁcers  had a higher level of familiarity
with campus.”

Station manager: WPTS structure unlike other stations

Woodie < 1

from a variety of sources, including the
Princeton Review and CM] College Radio
— an organization connecting music fans
to the music industry, McCann said. mtvU
also distributes questionnaires to record
labels across the nation and conducts an
open online vote. People across the nation
can vote for the College Radio Woodie on
mtvU’s website until Nov. 16.

“In September, we found out that we
were being considered in the top 100,”
Rebekah Mueller, the station’s promotions
director, said. “As soon as we found out

about the nomination, we put it on Face-
book, Twitter and on the air. It just kept
picking up speed that way.”

mtvU periodically cut the list of nomi-
nees over the last two months, ﬁrst from
100 to 50, then from 50 to 25. Last week,
directors at the WPTS found out they made
the top ﬁve.

Other stations in the top ﬁve include
WCRD 91.3 from Ball State University, Coy-
ote Radio from California State University,
San Bernardino, KCOU 88.1 from the Uni-
versity of Missouri and KUPS 90.1 from the

University of Puget Sound.

WPTS program directorjames Bedell
said he thinks WPTS made the list of nomi-
nees because the station and its employees
have a progressive attitude.

“We don‘t just play the hits,” Bedell said.
“We have a lot of variety: a metal show on
Tuesday nights, a live show every Wednes-
day featuring local, national and interna-
tional bands. We have blues on Fridays and
even show tunes on Sundays.”

Unlike many college stations, which

have disc jockeys play a random mix of

 

songs, WPTS programs always try to in-
volve some sort of creative direction.

“A lot of college stations do more of a
free—form thing,” McCann said. ﬁts a D] you
get a time slot and play whatever you want,
whatever you‘re into. WPTS is different.”

Many WPTS programs revolve around
a theme. For example, a program called
“Girls4EverBoys4Never” explores the roles
women play in the music world.

“We play screamin’ riot girls, croonin’
girl folk, powerhouse female vocalists, sun-
shiney ’60s girl pop, yodelin’ cowgirls and

all other forms of GIRL MUSIC, along with ‘

the Cute Boy of the Week and_ coverage of
the latest female-related news,” says the
WPTS website.

Editorial

Cameras efficient,

City officials may reinforce an
important traﬂic rule to Pittsbur-
ghers: just stop. Pittsburgh is con-
sidering installing cameras at cer-
tain intersections that photograph
cars speeding through red lights.

Using cameras to enforce red
light runners isn’t a new concept
or technology. New York and San
‘Francisco had cameras installed in
the mid-90s, and ‘now more than
200 U.S. cities use them. Never
mind the mistrustful naysayer
who screams “Big Brother” at the
sight of any looming lens —— these
cameras, if initiated, should be an

‘. effective tool for the city without

invading privacy.

As part of apilot program, Phila-
delphia installed several cameras
amid the heavily trafficked Route
1 back in 2005. The intersections
with the ‘cameras average around

27tickets per day compared to 120 _

per day in the ﬁrst year,‘accord-
ing to the Pittsburgh Post— Gazette.
Philadelphia  considering adding

_ more cameras.

While the speciﬁc ‘spots where
these cameras would be placed in
Pittsburgh aren’t yet known, they
should force wayward drivers to
pay attention to red lights. The
state could, of course, look to other
measures to enforce red lights, such
as adding more police, but these
cameras are eﬁicient and ‘cost-ef-
fective tools. Traffic accidents are

_ the single most signiﬁcant cause
I of preventable death and injury in

NorthAmerica. In 2007, almost 900
people were killed and an estimated

cost-effective tool

153,000 were injured in crashes
that involved red light running in
the United States, according to The
National Safety Commission.
Should the cameras be used to
monitor activity within the vehicle,
they could be seen as infringing on
privacy concerns. But the cameras
intend only to catch drivers run-

ning through red lights. Tlfe lenses

simply photograph the rear license
plate of violators’ vehicles. That’s

' it. The cameras will not take pic-
tures of the car’s driver or any of

its passengers. Once the camera
photographs a perpetrator’s license
number, the ticket is sent to him in
the mail.

In 2006, Pittsburgh Councilman
Bill Peduto introduced legislation
to bring red light cameras to the
city, but he couldn’t accumulate suf-

ﬁcient votes to pass it. Peduto, how- ,

ever, plans to try again next-year.
He said the ﬁnes generated would
go toward infrastructure improve-T
ment.‘As of August, Philadelphia

, has already seen almost $9 million

in revenue from the violations. “We
would’ve used the people who make
the city dangerous and use their
ﬁnes to make the city safer,” Peduto
said. He’s got a point.

While the cameras have reduced
accidents and fatalities, some loca-
tions have seen increases in rear-
end collisions as drivers hastily
slam the brakes after noticing the
camera towers. _

All things considered, it’s a mi-
nor drawback to the safety beneﬁt
these cameras can provide.

The Story of the Ghost Story.
Last year I took a graduate

« course in game theory. I failed the

midterm so I had to study hard for
the ﬁnal. I cooped myself up for
about a week in the kitchen copy-
ing solutions to problems and then
trying to solve the problems my-
self.-Pretty soon my kitchen table
was piled high with papers covered
in cryptic Greek letters.

Then one night, there was a
thunderstorm. Suddenly, a crash
of thunder shook the whole house,
and a gust of cold air extinguished
my old whale oil lamp. When I ﬁ-
nally lit a candle, I noticed some-
thing was awry with my papers. The
Greek letters were drifting about
on the page. At ﬁrst, I thought that
a ghost was making corrections,
but the Greek letters turned out
to block up in paragraphs. The
Greek, of course, was Greek to
me, so I took the pages over to my
neighbor Old Dame Kalopolis, to
whom it was also Greek but nev-
ertheless readable, because she

knows Greek.

Old Dame Kalopolis, reading
by the dance of candlelight, voice
straining over the din of thunder-
claps, translated the ghost’s mes-
sage. It was a story,’ albeit not a
very good one. It was hard to follow
and the scenes were not rendered
vividly. About halﬁrvay through we
put it down.

“I’ve got to wrap up studying,”
I said.

“Yeah. And I was gonna watch
‘Golden Girls’,” Old Dame Kalopolis
said.

Sometimes Iwish I remembered
the story better. The next day Old
Dame Kalopolis died of self-in-
ﬂicted strangulation and then my
house burned down, so the ghost’s
story was lost. If I can’t remember,
though, maybe it just goes to show
how forgettable the story was — at
least the ﬁrst half.

Ghost Cell Phones. ,

Have you ever had a phone die
while you were roaming? Well,
death is just the beginning for that
cell phone, just a gateway. The cell
phone is destined to roam across

Ghost stories of every variety

the land.

You know how, when you’re
around speakers and the cell phone
rings it makes that weird sound
in the speakers? Well, have you
ever heard the weird sound, but
then your cell phone didn’t ring?
That’s a ghost getting a phone call
on a ghost cell phone. And later on,
you’ll ﬁnd some discrepancies in
the phone bill, and if you call the
phone company, they’ll give you
the run around. They’re in on it
with the ghosts, I tell you.

Ghost of Girlfriends Past.
This is also the title of a popular
ghost porno movie.

Ghost of the Ghosts.

One time I lived in a haunted
house on Meyran Avenue. It was
so lousy with ghosts that I got a
priest to come in and exorcise the
joint. But he was only an Episcopal
priest, so he only got one of the
ghosts.

Some days later, I was eating
some cereal and I lifted my spoon
to my mouth, but much to my
chagrin it was full of blood. I spat

iWatch program infringes
upon personal freedoms

Abdul Ahmed
For The Pitt‘News

 

The attacks ontheworld Trade Center
produced an anxious America. Many
strained their eyes for evil. Few let
down their guard.

What is there to fear eight years
later? Decide for yourself. You might
have heard about Najibullah Zazi, a
citizen of Afghanistan and legal resi-
dent of the United States. '

According to the FBI, he tried to
buyalarge quantity of cosmetic prod-
ucts, hydrogen peroxide and acetone
sources. Authorities followed and inter-
viewedhimconcerningbomb-making
instructions found on his laptop and
his recent visits to Pakistan.

Ultimately, he was arrested and
chargedwithlyingto authorities about
aterroristic matter. He is pleading not
guilty-

A store clerk’s suspicion of Zazi’s
purchases prompted the clerk to in-
form authorities of his gut instinct.
Los Aiigeles police commanderjoan
McNamara has cited this incident as
something to learn from. Many com-
munities could train for such citizen
antiterrorist involvement, creating a
sort of “neighborhood watch.”

Together with Los Angeles police
chiefWilliam Bratton, McNamara de-
veloped the iVVatch program. Chiefs of
63 departments across the nation and
Canada recently endorsed it.

iwatch will use brochures, public
service announcements and meetings
with community groupsto deliver con-
crete advice on how the public should
perceive situations and report them.

Such a comprehensive and ex-
pansive progam can do nothing but
ensure a greater level of safety for us,
right? I mean, these sort of actions
did work to nab Zazi before he could
potentially do harm. So what’s wrong

wary of potential harms?

In this case, a lot.

We need no baimers, no slogans
and no mock fervor. This kind of ac-
tivism can lead to loss of rights. We
want aggressors to be picked out and
stopped, and ‘rightfully so, but what
happens when we ourselves become
doubted by ourbeloved public? Ittrick—
les down to a matter of what’s more
important: freedom or safety.

Everyone wants to feel safe, and the
intentions of Watch might be pure.
But the program could cause some
to become overzealous and lead to a
level of dist:rust.]ust because one man’s
was well-founded doesn’t mean that
suspicions should be held to a higher
degree of respect, that people should

’ go searching for a suspicion to then
pursue. Deal with what you get when
it comes,likethe clerk did. His instinct,
something we all have, was enough.

According to the American Civil
Liberties Union, Raed Jarrar was a
victim of this overactive behavior. He
wasaninnocent architect simplyﬂying
home. His offense: wearing a T-shirt
inscribed with “We will not be silent”
in Arabic script. TSA oiﬁcials reﬁised
to let him board unless he removed it.
Deemed notasecuritythreat, Raedwas
singled out because ofhis ethnicity and
the constitutionally protected speech
onhis shirt. ‘

Behaviors people would be suspi-
cious aboutiniwatchareoften mistak-
able. Wearing a shirt isn’t criminal.

iWatch also demarcates smelling
chemicals orﬁimes aworthy suspicion.
What if a homeowner funiigates his
house to kill mites or has gas leakage
in his plumbing? Sounds silly, but to
the Match junkie, the innocent hom-
eowner could be a prime target.

Ifyou see someone purchasingsup-
plies or equipment that could be used
to make bombs it is worthy of report.
Report forms on the Match website

you wonder if you can fertilize your

. lawn without turning heads. 4

Mike German, policy counsel of
the ACLU, thinks that since the ques-
tionable activities are such'common
practices, suspicions will fall onto the
all-too-familiar crutch of personal bi-
ases and stereotypes.

In the program’s defense, McNa-
mara said reports based on race or
ethnicitywill notbe accepted. Itforces
one to wonder how the recipients of
the reports, the individual personnel,
are going to sift out suspicions with
merit.

Fortunately, trained professionals
willbe equippedforthe task, according
toArtFemister, president and founder
ofthe NationalAssociationCitizens On
Patrol. Indeed, such discretion is vital
to the program’s success.

Still, fear is understandable — in-
evitable—fromthosewho commonly
fall into the trench of racial proﬁling.

Will citizens’ reports befairto sus-
pects of, say, Middle Eastern appear-
ance? Ifa disproportionate number of
suspects are of this appearance, is it
becausetheywere infactquestionable,
or were they perceived as more likely
to be guilty -— a sort of self-ﬁilﬁlling
prophecy? The former would be ac-
ceptable.

Harboring constant concern and
providing a quick and haphazard
means to attemptto resolve perceived
threats creates an unpredictable en-
vironment. Hostilities could arise
that were previously nonexistent, as
in_]arrar’s case. Racial proﬁling could
perpetuate from this new surge of ac-
tivism.

on I was nice and I got a zombie

ghost of the ghost. Afterward, the
zombie priest and I watched “The

“This is so unrealistic!”

Ghost of Roommates Past.

Dimitri was a good friend. A
week after he was gone, I put up
a plaque on his door that said, “In
memoriam, Dimitri Gouldov.” But
the plaque only emphasized how
empty the room seemed without
him. ‘

Empty  until one day it was
abuzz with activity. The lights
would turn on and off. On a warm
evening, we would ﬁnd the win-
dow open. Dimitri’s bed would be

ever more cozily? So, I called up
Dimitri. I said, “I know you’re busy
in Memphis at Teach for America,_
but you gotta come back here and
take care your damn ghost. It’s not
paying rent, and we can’t get some-
one to sublet.”

Dimitri came home and chatted
up the ghost. He explained that
Memphis has new friends and new
bars and new adventures waiting.
Life is more than fun, Dimitri said.
It’s also about giving others the
opportunities, like college, that
we enjoyed so much. The ghost
moved on. it — V

After that, Dimitri and I had '

a talk about the plaque, which
he found much weirder than the
ghost.

Pitt Jazz Weekcelebrates its 39th year“

Atradition started by Nathan Davis, Pitt Jazz Week lives on

Natalie ‘Bell
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

When Nathan Davis started PittJazz
Week, hewas simplytryingtoﬁllade-
sire students had for jazz and to share
hisexpertise. ' ‘
“In a way, it wasn’t me being so
much visionary as the time. Itwas the

. time,” Davis said.

Thejazzstiidiesprogram atPittand
PittJazz Week are inextricably linked.
The latter was born outof an eﬂbrt to
educate students by introducing them
to some jazz greats.

When Davis arrived to teach a new

jazz curriculum at Pitt, there were only
ahandﬁil of suchprograms throughout
the cotmtry. Priorto corningto Pitt, he’d

' beenlivinginParis,worl<ingasamusi~

cian and teaching a summer course at
the Paris American Academy. At the
time, European jazz programs were

more numerousthanthose atAmerican
universities, and Davis felt American
students were missing out.

“I said, well if I ever teach, that’s
what we ought to have in America,
that’s where it’s from. So when I got
here and I saw the opportunity, I did
it,” he said.

Pitt solicited Davis for aposition at
Pitt. He received a mix of encourage-
ment and negativity when he decided
to accept the professorship. Some of
his peers felt that racial issues_ would
be problematic and that it would be
impossible to teach jazz, while others
felt Davis was being given a valuable
chance to sharejazz knowledge with
people formerly unaware.

“'I‘henJimmy Clark, whowasfrom
Pittsburgh, said to me, ‘Go back and
spread the word and tell the truth,”’

J Davis said.

Soon, however, he saw just how
responsive students would be to a

jazz curriculum at Pitt. The ﬁrst day of
Davis’ History ofJazz class, about 250

students were waiting eagerly to hear
his lecture.

A “Ithinkstudents were hungry forit
in America,” he said.

-We were being
treated as good as

the classical cats.
Nathan Davis

Davis had been teaching at Pitt for
only a few months when Art Blakey
and the Jazz Messengers can1e in to
Pittsburgh in 1970. After playing with
them, Davis invited the group to come
speak and play at Pitt. With no more

advertisementthanword of mouth and
perhaps hand ﬂyers, enough students
and teachers swarmed to see the group
to pack the Stephen Foster Memorial
building.

A black Pittsburgh photographer,
Teenie Harris, photographedthe event.
The novelty ofDavis havingjustarrived
ﬁ‘om Paris combined with the recent
advent of jazz curriculums at universi-
ties helped the event make it into the
days leading jazz publication, Down-
Beat Magazine.

“It was just impromptu basically,”
Davis said‘ of the birth of Pitt Jazz
Week.

The eventwas incrediblysuccessﬁil,
enough so that Davis continued to pull
in all kinds ofnames injazz to come
and play at Pit. The institution of jazz
programs atuniversities and the enthu-
siasmfrom students were due recogni-
tion for jazz and the artists involved.

“We were being treated as good as

the classical cats,” Davis said.

However, there were times of dif- '

ﬁculty for Pittjazz Week and the jazz
program, in general. Davis had to seek
funding for the musicians who were
coming and sharing their talents for
free. There were times that the “jazz
guys’ ’wene notperrnittedtoplay certain
instruments.

In one instance, the jazz band was
made to rehearse in an unheated build-
ing off campus. Davis, along with the
involved students, banded togetherand

sat in on the dean’s office to demand

better conditions.

‘‘I’m the kind of guy, you challenge
me, you gotaﬁght. So,Iduginand here
we are  One thing, I got a positive at-
titude about the whole thing,” he said.

Because he continued (and still
continues) to play as a professional
musician, Davis was able to discuss his
program with peoplealloverthe world,
spreading awareness ofjazz Week.

With problemslike Larry’s, it’s hard not to be ‘A Serious Man’

The latest Coen Brothers’ film serves as a tragic ode to the Book of Job

Noah Levinson
Staﬁ’ Writer

“A Serious Man”

Starring: Michael Stuhl-
barg, Richard Kind and Fred
Melamed

Directed by Ethan and Joel
Coen A

Studio: Focus Features
Grade:A—

The Coen brothers are ad-
dicted to tragedy. In almost all
of their ﬁlms, someone gets shot,
loses their family or gets stuffed
into a wood chipper. You know
what_kind of movie you’re walk-
ing into- if Joel and Ethan Coen
are headlining the directing and
writing credits.

They seriously define the
modern genre of tragedy, and
“A Serious Man” might be their
most tragic ﬁlm yet.

A loose adaptation or com-
parison to the Book of Job, the

ﬁlm begins in Eastern Europe,
in a distant Yiddish past. AJew-
ish couple meets an old man,
who was thought to literally be
dead by the community. The
wife proclaims the man to be a
“dybbuk,” a ghost of sorts, and
acts upon her beliefs in violent
Coen—style. '

Flashforward_to 1967 Minne-
sota and "enter Larry Gopnik, a
Jewish physics professor who is
coming close to achieving tenure
in the late 1960s. Everything that
could possibly go wrong in his
life is going wrong.

One of his students bribes
him fora passing grade, his
wife leaves him for their wid-
ower neighbor Sy Ableman (Fred
Melamed), his brother Arthur
(Richard Kind) is pursued by the’
police for gambling issues, and
on top of all that, his pot—smok-

idly approaching.

A ‘Boondock’ conundrum .

Andy Tybout
Columnist

Here’s a rags—to-riches story gone
wrong: In the mid ’90s, a West Holly-
wood bartender writes a screenplay
about Catholic vigilantes going on a

‘ -highlystylizedkillingspree. Somehow,
the manuscript ﬁnds its way to Mira-
maxFilms, which offers the bartendera
$15—million contractto directthe movie
and composethe musical scorewithhis
band.Thatmoviewoul_dbe called “The
Boondock Saints.”

Then everything falls apart. Be-
cause of conﬂicts between Troy Duffy,
the bartender and Harvey Weinstein,
the co-founder of Miramax, the stu-
dio decides to drop the movie. Duffy is
forcedto makethe ﬁlmwith less than

' ’ halfof the original budget. He screens
it at the Cannes Film Festival, and no
one buys it. Duffy and his bluecollar
friends drop out of the movie business
and go backtotheirbanalforrnerlives.
The ﬁlm eventually becomes a major
cult classic, selling around $50 mil-
lion in domestic video sales, but Duffy
and his friends don’t get a cent — the
royalties from such sales aren’tintheir
contract.

But somehow, 10 years later, Duffy

and co. are back for more, with ‘The
Boondock Saints H:All Saints Day.” But
is this even a good

Regardless, “The Boondock Saints”

lescent fandom, with Tarantino-like
strokes of excess and political incor-

'rectnessthatyoungadults—especially

young males —- revere. And when the
trailer for “The Boondock Saints H”
screened at this year’s Comic Con, the
crowd gave it a standing ovation.

Critics, however, have been less
favorable, deploring the movie’s poor
plot and occasional racism and ho-
mophobia.

stories, andthefactthatDuti'ymanaged

The problem may be Duﬂ’y. The

man’s reputationhasbeeninperilever
since the 2003 documentary, “Over-
night,” which chronicled his tumultu-
ous rise andfallﬁom Hollywood grace.
For most of the documentary, Duﬂ'y
more resembles Kenny Powers from
“Eastbound&Down,”thanavisionary
youngTarantino -— cursing outfriends,
making absurd declarations about his

tistical snot. .

Should we praise Duffy, using his
storyas anexample oftenacityintimes
of crisis? Or should itbe more of a cau-
tionary tale —— an example of destruc-
tive egotism? V

I’m inclined to go with the former.
Duﬂ‘y doesn’t make masterpieces, but
thefactthathe canmake movies atall

Stillthough, it’s notthe recognition
that keeps Davis working to make Pitt

“that the students continue to have a

j H Diana Connor I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Elizabeth Adams and the rest of the Pitt tennis team will take a three-
month break before resuming their spring season in February.

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

Thisfall, ElizabethAdams reached 101
career victories, becoming the fastest
Pitt women’s tennis player to achieve
100 victories. Adams, a junior, still
has the spring season and her entire
senior year remaining to add to her
wintotal. A

With the conclusion of its fall sea-
son last week, the Pitt tennis team
now takes a threemonth break from
competition. '

The Panthers, like all collegiate
tennis teams across the country, won’t
compete again until next February.
The collegiate tennis season is split in
halﬁwiththefallseason rtmningfrom
September through October and the
spring season beginning in February
and wrapping up in April.

Pitt competed at the Wilson/Inter-

l collegiate Tennis Association Women’s

Atlantic Region Championships atVir-
giniaTechlastweek, andno teamplays
aﬁerthatpointuntil matchand confer-
ence play picks up again in February.

V “From the middle ofjanuary, you
start practicing and then go to the

‘ end of April,” Pitt head coach George

Dieffenbach said. “In comparison to
volleyball, which starts in September
and goes through part of November,
tennis is a long season.”

Dieffenbach said theteamtakes an

academic approachtothe three—m0nth
break until the Panthers begin play

. again Feb. 6 against Maryland.

_ They will_conditi0n two days a
week, and the players will continue
to practice when they can ﬁnd court
time. Dieifenbach said the Panthers
wouldn’t begin regularpractices again
until January, adding that the break
gives the athletes a chance to catch up
on school work.

He said he uusts that the athletes
will continue to stay in shape on their
own overwinterbreak, so the teamwill
be prepared and ready to play when
oﬂicial practices start again.

“We will have some challenge
matches,” Dieffenbach said. “Itwillbe a
smooth transition. We want to peak at
the righttime. We wantto peak forthe
Big East championship inApril.”

The Panthers played inthreediffer-
enttournaments duringthefallseason.
TheWomen’s Eastern Collegiate Invita-
tionalstartedthe seasoninseptember,
followedbysergio Tacchini Invitational
and the ITA in October.

Theteamhadasuccessfulfall, with
anumber of players advancingto semi-
ﬁnal rounds, said Dieffenbach.

Dieffenbach said one of the high
points ofthefallseason occurredwhen
Elizabeth Adams and Shannon Benic
wentto the semi—ﬁnals after defeating
the No. 1—seeded doubles team at the
Sergio Tacchini Invitational in Nor-
folk, Va.

Adams and Benic overcame Alex
Bara and Joseﬁn Hjertquist of Vir-

ginia Commonwealth in a tiebreaker "

9-8 (3)-

Adams, who led the Panthers
during the fall season, also won the
singles consolation bracket att:he tour—
nament.

Despite falling in the ﬁrst round,
Adams and Benic continued their im-
pressive play at the ITA. No. 4~seeded
Joanna Dobrowolska and Nadine Fa-
houm of Old Dominion edged out the
Pitt duo 8-6.

“Thatwas the biggest tournament

inthe east,”Dieﬁ'enbach said. “Old Do?‘

minion went on to the win the whole
tournament and will represent the
region at national indoors.”

Both Adams and Minh Evans
advanced to the ﬁnals at the Eastern
Women’s Collegiate Invitational. EV-
answentz-2 and won the Faith Singles

~ bracket, while theﬁfth—seededAdams

ﬁnished with a 2-2 record in the main
singles bracket.

Dieffenbach said he is hopingfora
quick recovery for senior Sabrina Vis-

ram,whose seasonendedprematiirely A

last year after she tore her ACL. She
collected seven doubles wins and six
singles victories before her 

“A lot of players got experience this
fall,” Dieffenbach said. “We have a lot
ofdepth onthisyeafs teamfrom spots
one through eight. There are good
things ahead for us.”

Taylor leads men ’s basketball to victory in exhibition game,

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team

' trailed Slippery Rock 29-27 with

around three minutes to go in the
ﬁrst half of yesterday’s exhibition
game at the Petersen Events ‘Cen-
ter. Then, freshman center Dante
Taylor took over.

A 3—pointer by Dwight Miller
gave the Panthers a 30-29 lead
with less than three minutes to
play, and Taylor then scored the
next eight points to give Pitt a
38-31 lead en route to a 75-64
victory. V

Taylor scored in a variety of
ways, hitting two free throws,
picking up a loose ball under the
basketball and laying it in and out-

running all Slippery Rock defend-
ers, in transition for a slam dunk
assisted on a bounce pass from
half court by Travon Woodall.

“I come in [with] high energy,
trying to get the crowd going, try—
ing to get my teammates going,”
Taylor said.

Taylor wasn’t a starter, instead
the Panthers trotted out Woodall,
Ashton Gibbs, Brad Wanamaker,
Nasir Robinson and Gary McGhee
to begin the game. Taylor and se-
nior transfer Chase Adams were
the ﬁrst players off the bench.

.“Sitting on the bench, I was
able to see how the game was go-
ing,” Taylor said.

Off the bench, Taylor led all
players with 27 points on 9-of-11
shooting from the ﬁeld and 9-of-
11 on free throws. He also led all

players with nine rebounds.
“I tried to box him out, but he

was just a beast on the boards,” ‘

Slippery Rock’s Jabril Bailey
said.

Even though the late surge gave
Pitt a 40-31 lead at the half, Slip-
pery Rock hung around with the
Panthers, out—rebounding them
24-17, including a 12-2 advantage
on offensive rebounds. Another

big reason Slippery Rock stayed"

with Pitt throughout the game
was its quick shooting. The Rock
took-75 shots, 46 from beyond the
3-point arc. The Panthers took
56 shots.

“Early we weren’t prepared
for them to shoot the three,” Pitt
coachjamie Dixon said. “It threw
[the team] into something they
haven’t seen before.”

The only other Panther in
double ﬁgures was Robinson,
who scored 11 points. McGhee was
next with nine points and a game:
high three blocks. Woodall led all
players with seven assists.

Dixon expects to see a much
different team in Pitt’s next ex-
hibition game Sunday at the Pete
against Coker College at 4 p.m.

“We’re going to be a much bet-
ter team come next exhibition
game,” he said.

Notes: Freshman Talib Zanna
didn’t play because of a groin and
knee injury, according to Dixon.
“He could go, but he’s not 100
percent,” he said. Dixon wasn’t
sure when guardjermaine Dixon
would be back. The senior, who is
out with a broken foot, will go for
an X—ray this week, Dixon said.

e8  disappointing season  

Diana Connor I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGPHER



Junior Mike Cunha and the rest of the Panthers ﬁnished their season

Saturday night with a 2-13-2 record.

 

Evan Burgos
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team ended a
dismal season, dropping its ﬁnal con-
test of the year to Marquette 5-0 on
Saturday night. The drubbingwas the
exclamation mark onaseasoninwhich
the Panthers went 2-13-2 and 1-9-1 in
Big East play, good for last place in the
conference. _

Saturday, the Golden Eagles (4-9-3,
3-4-3 Big East) got off to a quick start,
with striker Chris Madsen scoring
two goals in the ﬁrst half. They went
to the locker room at halftime with a
3-0 lead. .

Madsen’s ﬁrst goal came just three
minutes into the contest. He completed
the hattrickinthe second halfand also
had one assist. Madsen tied the Val-
ley Fields record for points in a single
game.

“Thiswas obviouslyadisappointing
game. We gave up avery early goal and
the second goal, we just never recov-
ered,” Pitt head coachjoe Luxbacher
said. “Itwas not a good effort’?

With the win, Marquette clinched
the ﬁnal spot in the conference cham-
pionships. Notre Dame, Connecticut,

West Virginia, Georgetown and Provi-
dence also qualiﬁed.

Marquette out-shot Pitt 12-5. Lux-
bacher said the Panthers possessed
the ball well throughout the game, but
Marquette converted its opportunities.
The Panthers, who have struggled to
score goals all year, were without se-
nior forwards Matt Baker and Chris
Wilcox.

The t_earn, which usually travels to
road games the daybefore the contest,
ﬂewto Milwaukee the same dayas the
game. 'I“1p—offwas 8:05 p.rn. Luxbacher
saidtheteamrnakes no excusesforthe
poor effort

“Maybe thatwas arnistake, but our
frame of mindwas good goinginto the
game,” he said.

The lopsided loss istrue to the Pan-
ther’s 2009 form. The team had lost
or tied 14 straight games before top-
ping Seton Hall 3-2 three days prior to
the game at Marquette. Eight of those
games were decided by one goal, and
the Panthers lost two of them in over-
time.

‘The fact is, most of the games we
were right there but didnft get the re-
sult,”Luxbachersaid. “We’re notthatfar
away as our record would appear.”

St1'll,thePanthersnowembarkonan

off-season with many question marks.
Nextweek, the coaching staifwill hold
individual player meetings with every
member of the team. In the meetings,
coaches will discuss each player’s role,

andwhathehasto doto remainonthe‘

team next season. Luxbachar said the
team has ﬁve or six commitments for

1 nextyear.

“It will be tough for these guys to
keep their spot,” Luxbacher said.-“We
dontwanttobeabottomfeeder. Ithink
we have a good core of players, but we
need some guys to be difference mak-
ers.”

Luxbacher said the team’s goal is
to become a top—tier Big East soccer
program The team has no place to go

‘ but up. Luxbacher said he takes conﬁ-

dence from games against Connecticut
andWestV1rginia, both rankedteams.
The Panthers lost a tight game to Con-
necticut2—0 andt1'edWestVirginia0—0
in two overtime periods.

The loss to Marquettewasthe Pan-

ther’s second 5-0 defeat of the year. A

They lost to Louisville bythe same

_, count in late September on the road, .
but that doesn’t make this result any

easierto take.
“It’s deﬁnitely disappointing,” Lux-
bacher said.

I have to give the Olympics credit. It
somehow makes me watch sports
like archery, badminton and speed
skating with the fervor of a European

. soccer fan.

But the excitement of the Olympics

if is beaten out by one thing —— the lead

up to the Olympics. There’s never a
shortage of controversy and enter-
tainment. Here are some of the more
interesting things leading up to next
year’s Winter Olympics.

The Mascot ~

Through the magic of revisionist
history, 30 years ago every sports team
hadabeautifuljersey and the Olympics

had simple, stately mascots. The 1968 
~'.§SlllTlI'I'leI' games in Mexico City had a

dove. Los Angeles used a bald eagle
in 1984.

But Vancouver 2010 continues‘ a
recent trend of coming up with the
dumbest looking things. for mascots.
Of all the animals I think of when I

--4» .
hear Canada, a mythical sea bear, a

sasquatch and a marmot are near the
bottom of the list.
Representing Vancouver 2010,

Olympic watch list: mascots

meet Quatchi, Miga and Mukmuk
—— mascots so adorable they belong
on your next e—greetir1g card. The de-
signer of the mascots even gave the
sasquatch cute little earmuffs. I’m not
sure if they belong in the Olympics or
a Hello Kitty backpack.

Ticket Prices

If you’ve ever thought about go-
ing to the Olympics and watching the
thrills of alpine skiing time trials in
person, ﬁnd other plans.

In a masochistic “I wish I had that

much money” ritual, I looked up the

cost of the gold medal hockey game for
Vancouver2010.Alower level seatwill
set you back $775, assuming you are
lucky enough to purchase one before
they sell out. For comparison, retail
prices for the Super Bowl range from
$500 to $1,000.

Keep in mind that ﬁnding a room
in an overbooked hotel will also cost
you big time. Furthermore, you aren’t
goingto travel there forjust one game,
so charge a few other events to your
MasterCard. ‘

There’s luge for $85 and cross
country skiing for $70. My personal
favorite event, the Nordic combined,
costs $120. My limit was $110. No
.wonderI see empty seats every Olym-

piad.

Protestors

I’ve always‘ been mesmerized by
the Olympic Torch. I guess it works
like a Zippo lighter, but you’d think
with all the rain and the running that
it would go out at some point. And
I’rn pretty sure the Olympics would
be canceled if it does.

Sidney Crosby and the Torch
Sidney Crosbywill carry the Olympic
Torch through part of Nova Scotia on
Nov. 18. The relay began on Friday
and will drag on for several months,
culminating at the Opening Ceremo-
nies on Feb. 12. _

the time the

es Vancou-

Other people must share my wor-
ries, too, since I always see a bunch of
people screaming and shouting ev-
erywhere the ﬂame goes. “Don’tbum
out!” they must be yelling. “I want to
watch the Nordiccombined!”

Some people even hangbarmers on
bridges. I don’t bother reading them.
I’m far too enamored with the spunky
windbreakers every torchbearer re-
ceives, but it’s nice to see everybody
so happy for once.

matter of time before I get to carry it.

The Opening Ceremony

Before the Olympic cauldron is lit,
we have the OpeningCeremonyto look

China, you dida pretty good job.

But if I know Canada, it’ll have some-
thing three, no, eight times as awe-
some. After all, Canadians invented
hockey. What did you invent, China?

"Paper? That’s not even an Olympic
sport.

I have three suggestions for Can-
ada’s ceremony: space bears, tens of
thousands of lumberjacks and _the
keyboard cat. 1

- The Final Torchbearer
At the end of the ceremony, a yet-
to—be-named personwilllight the caul-

dron. Now I’rn not saying it’s not me,

but there are more worthy people.

Ifit were my decision, it would be
Betty Fox. Her son, Terry Fox, began
the Marathon ofHope in1980 to raise
money forcancer research three years
after losing his right leg to bone can-
cer. Traveling across Canada, he ran
an average of 23 miles per day for 143
consecutive days  he learned his
cancer had metastasized to his lungs.
He died nine monthselater, journey
unﬁnished. 1 *4

Considering the 2010 Olympics
are on the western cost of Canada,
where Foifs run was to end, and 
is the torch relay we’re talking about,
it seems likga no -brainer.
