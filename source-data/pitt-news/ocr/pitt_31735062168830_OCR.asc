Plans to Eliminate Most Fees

by MARSHA REHNS

The $100 non-resident fee‘
and charges for equipment
and laboratory courses will
be eliminated for out-of-
state students as the fall
term, 1967, Chancellor David
Kurtzman announced today.

The tuition for all students,

whether from Pennsylvania or
not will be stab-ilized at $700 per

‘ term for those taking 12 or more

credits or nine credits‘ at_ the
post - baccalaureate level, D r.
Kurtzman explained.

Pennsylvania students will still
pay $225 per term at the under-
graduate level, he said. The tui-
tion subsidy by the state, there-
fore, will be stabilized at $475 per
term. Currently the state subsi-
dy is calculated individually for
each student. ,

The $700, exclusive of late reg-
istration and change of course
fees, will be maximum for any
full - time undergraduate since
lab, equipment, and activities fee
will not be charged. . -

The activities fee will be pro-
vided for by a separate budget
allocation in the Dean of Stu-
dents’ office, based on ﬁve dol-
lars for each full-time ‘undergrad-
uate enrolled. The_ Dean. of , Stu-C
dents in consultation with the
Dean of Student Affairs will plan
the administration of the funds.

Beginning with the’ Class of
1968, the $35’ graduation fee will
also be eliminated. This is the
only change which will actually

of the Men’s Dorm Council
(MDC), announced that the

new rules drafted by the MDC

were partially approved last Mon-
day by Dean of Men Herbert Mc-

. Gibbeny.

The news rules will make it
easier ‘for men in the dorms to

have weekend open houses. Pre- _

viously_ three counselors and a
woman chaperon were necessary
for an open house. On weekends,
however, only one counselor was
available per six dorm ﬂoors.
Hence, there was obvious difficul-
ty in persuading all three house
counselors to donate their free
time for a weekend open house.

The new rules call for a reduc-
tion in the number of counselors.
Now, only one counselor is re-
quired for an open house. This
greatly improves the chances of
ﬁnding a free counselor for ei-
ther Friday or Saturday night. It
also means that any weekday
open house will automatically go
into effect because one counselor
is always on duty in each house.

lor Cmust volunteer for duty.
Matters such as the method of
voting for open houses and the
time span for weekend open
houses have not yet been spelled
out. These details will be worked
out by members of the house and’
their counselors.
Dean McGibbeny rejected MDC

Dr. Harries Criticizes Theology

lMan Can Be Close

/1.

' ‘.

»~‘

by DIANNE FABER

The second speaker for the
University Chaplains Asso-
ciation series on Religion and
Culture, Dr. Karsten Har-
ries, professor of philosophy
at Yale University, spoke last
Wednesday at noon in the SU
Ballroom on “The Critical-Phil-
osophical Failure of the Radical
Theologians.”

Dr. Harries directed his re-
marks against the “God is Dead”
movement. While he did not deny
the “death of God,” he found
fault with the present arguments
supporting the new theology.

According to Dr. Harries, the
new religious philosophers are
trying to provide a modern theo-
logical language since the tradi-
tional language cannot be under-
stood in today‘s context. Yet, Dr.
Harries questions, if that tradi-
tional language cannot be under-
stood, how can it be translated
accurately?

Dr. Rubenstein
Discusses Book

Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein will
discuss his recently published
book, After Aushwitz: Essays in
Contemporary Judaism, Sunday
at 8 p.m. in the Regal Room of
the YM and WHA, 315 S. Belle-
ﬁeld Ave.

Dr. Rubenstein, who is. chap-
lain to Jewish students in the
Pittsburgh area, is a leading Jew-
ish spokesman in the current
Death of God controversy. He has

published articles in Oommen-'

xntary Magazine and other publica-

'1,

it
 RUSSIAN

" tions.

The review, which is open to
the University community, will
be preceded by a short Hillel
business meeting and refresh-
ments will be served following
the program.

A key issue of the “Death of
God” theology with which Dr.
Harries disagrees is the interpre-
tation of man’s situation today.
The new theology sees the mod-
orn Christian choosing between

world and the profane or secular
world.

Modern man is reflective man.
"To reﬂect is to step away,” said
Dr. Harries The reﬂective man
stands before the world and is
no longer in the world. He sees
a collection of objectives which
receive meaning only through his
own attitudes. All meanin 35.,
therefore, come from within man
Modern man is autonomous.
According to Dr. Harries, au-
tonomous man denies a trans
cendent world. By denying the
sacred or transcendent, man dc-
nies God. This denial is by his
own choice. Man chooses accord-
ing to the meanings he gives to
the world.

Dr. Harries questions such
views on several points. First he

the sacred or transcendental‘

To God

questions whether sacred and pro-
fane worlds stand at opposite
pcles as suggested by the new
theology: How can man be aware
of the profane without a shari-
owy perception of the sacred?

Secondly, Dr. Harries attacks
the interpretation of modern man
as an autonomous being. M93-V
ingful choices can be made only
when their foundation is believed
to be outside man‘. If all reason
come from within man they are
arbitrary, based only on man’s
attitudes.

To affirm self and freedom Dr.
Harries suggests that man must
have an ideal image of man as a
criterion for his deductions. The
ideal must come from outside of
man. It need not be true, but
man must believe it is to have an
image of himself and other men.

Thus, Dr. Harries denies that
modern man is autonomous. Man
needs God. He needs God for a
foundation for his choosing, for
his knowledge of self and for an
awareness of his secular world.

Dr. David Platt, associate pro-
fessor in the Department of Mi-
crobiology, and Dr. Frank Draus,
professor in the Department of
Biochemistry, have been named
to head their respective depart-
ments. Announcement of the ap
pointments was made by School
of Denistry Dean Edward J. For-
rest.

A native of New York City, Dr.
Platt received a B.S. at Upper
Iowa University in 1948, and an
M.S. degree in 1952 and a Ph.D.
degree in 1957 from the Univer-
sity of Alabama. He was a Re-
search Fellow of the Arthritis
and Rheumatism Foundation from
1953 to 1957.

ters to several volumes on inter-
action of sugars with proteins
and amino acids, and on animal

‘polysaccharides, as well as pa-

pars on these subjects and on
connective tissue and glyoopro-
teins.

Dr. Draus, a native of Duponit,
Pa., received a B.S. degree from
Alliance College and M.S. and
Ph.D. degrees in biochemistry at
Duquesne University. In 1956, he

came to Pitt as research assistant

in the School of Dentistry and
moved up the academic ladder,
being named professor and act-
ing chairman of the Department
of Biochemistry. ,

He has taught in both the
School of Dentistry and School of
Pharmacy and has published
more than a score of papers on
his research work. He is current-

  The Same

It’s rare that an administrator makes a decision. with which students
-ihrhave no argument. But the recent announcement of the elimination of
 .0 various fees is such a decision.

[ The reduction in costs shows an awareness bythe administration of
 two basic problems of student life. First the Chancellor of the University,
Yitinl David Kurtzman, seems genuinely interested in attracting more out of
state students. Getting rid of the $100 non-resident fee is certainly one
‘ ‘way of bringing applicants from ‘across the nation. 0‘

At the same time Dr. Kurtzman also wants to limit the financial bur-
‘den on the University student, even if he is only being charged the Penn- T
sylvania tuition rate. The extra fees of laboratory courses could quickly
, add up to a minor strain on the wallet. Now a natural science student on
.  a limited budget won’t be faced with these added expenses.
There is only one point of concern which comes -out of the administra-
;J tion’s announcement. Undergraduates will no longer be charged the ﬁve
dollar activity fee, although a separate budget allocation based on ﬁve dol-
U —lars for each full-time undergraduate will be turned over to the Dean of
. Student Affairs’ Office. The problem is that the Dean will no longer be

because they ﬁnd it (or
think they will find it) dif-

red tape to register. Racial
discrimination is another
barrier to voting in the
South.

IN THE past, ‘such red
tape in Ames has included
proof of registration of a
car or a leased apartment.

Third, students don’t vote
because they know ‘little
about the candidates or is-
sues. They reason that it
would be better not to vote

this is as it should be be-

interests are served if stu-
dents are more interested in
politics than in education.
There is, however, a bal-
ance between the two. It

does not require joining a"

The most logical way to deal with the new situation is that the Dean
of Student Affairs should ask Student Government to appoint a committee
of students to allocate the activities fund. The Dean would continue to h_ave
veto power over the committee decisions. The only change from the pres-
sent system is that the committee’s decisions would notibe returned to Stu-
dent Government for the senate’s approval. This always seemed to us an

extraneous step‘ and we do not feel students’ rights will be ill-effected if

Historical ‘Fact’

Editor, Pitt News:
Recent revelations from the
halls of Academe have shaken

‘ one of our most cherished beliefs,

i.e. that Columbus discovered
America. Striking out with all
the academic artillery at their
command, Yale scholars (among
others), after eight years of lucu-
bration, announced (fortuitously
just before Columbus Day) that
they are now sure that Colum-
bus was not the ﬁrst to discover
America. But what do these learn-
ed men mean when they say that
Norsemen discovered America be-
fore Columbus?

As far as the Indians (pardon
this and other anachronisms)
were concerned Lief "and the
boys discovered nothing, atileast
no more than an Indian traveling
to Europe in 1300 A.D. could be

,said have discovered Europe.

Given this perspective, the Indi-
an discovered Europe just as the
Norsemen discovered North Amer-
ica. If this is what these scholars
meant by discovery then the ﬁrst
to discover America were the In-
dians who—as the best historical
knowledge (has it—-crossed the
Bering Strait and gradually Ini-
grated southward. But to answer
the question in this fashion is

spread of this interest were the
journeys and letters of Colum-
bus (De Insulis Inuentis; Epistola
Christoferi Colom). '

' As a result of Columbus’ voy-
ages the speculations about the
“great land to the West” were
converted into certainty, and the
way was opened across the At-
lantic which has never since been
closed. The fact that his discov-
eries came at a time when Eur-
ope. was at the beginning of a
great intellectual awakening cer-
_tainly was an important factor
in having these discoveries act-
ed upon. Nevertheless, Columbus’
letters—as translated in four lan-
guages and running through 17

' editions——made all Europe aware

surely to be trival or irrelevant ’

or both. -
The really importantquestion
is what event or events led to
the general European interest in
this “New World”--an interest
which resulted in the coloniza-

iftibkn of North and South America

and ultimately to the establish-
ment inter alia. of the U.S.A. If
this is the really important ques-
tion, then the events which most
contributed to the development
and spread of this interest were
the events which most contri-
buted to the development and

Editor’s ‘Logic’
Not Understood

Editor, Pitt News:

A I was rather amazed by the
editor’s note in the Jan. 25 Let-
ters to Editor column which
stated the editor-in-chief’s opposi-
tion to the American Civil Liber-
tieslUnion’s “unwise” advice on
the grounds that “the adminis-
tration of a university should not
become embroiled in a battle
which has deﬁnite political over-
tones.” I was, however, even more
shocked to ﬁnd that the next is-
sue of the paper contained not
one single objection to this state-

’ ment by any member of the aca-

The

demic community.‘ My only con-
clusion was that, apparently, few
thinking members of the aca-
demic community at Pitt read
“one of America’s great student
newspapers.”

Letters to the Editor

this Senate veto is removed. When it was ﬁrst rumored that the fee struc-
ture would be changed, informal discussions between student leaders and
administration produced this solution to deal with the activities fee change.
We concur that it is the best way to deal with the change over.

What must be remembered above all else is that the administration, ’
and in particular Chancellor Kurtzman, decided that student expenses were
a problem of prime priority. At most schools across the country (including
our neighbors, Carnegie Tech and Duquesne) tuition and fees are on the

' rise. We are fortunate that this is one area in which Pitt is an exception
to the national rule, ‘ ~

lllllllllllIllllllllllllllllll

What I cannot comprehend
is the logic of the student edi-
tor who believes that by submit-

ting requested membership lists.

to HUAC, the university becomes
any less “embroiled in a battle
which has deﬁnite political over-
tones.” Since the editor-in-chief
grants that “the University’s duty
is to imbue its students with cer-
tain values,” might I suggest that
a. rather important value to be
taught is that of having the cour-
age of one’s convictions? As con-
solation to the weak-kneed‘, I
might refer to the oft-quoted line

' of Camus, “. . . by our silence or

by the stand we take, we too
shall enter the fray,” but per-

haps the editor’s note after this ‘

letter might call Camus’ com-
ment “unwise” as well. One won-

. ders what kind of treatment poor

Socrates might have received
from our circumspect editor-in-
chief.

PharmacySchool
Tests New Drug
From Polynesia

Investigators from the Univer-
sity’s School of Pharmacy yester-
day described the psychopharma-
cologic activity _of a new drug
obtained from Kava Kava, a P0-
lynesian root.

The report was announced by
Dr. Joseph P. Buckley, professor
of pharmacology; Dr. Angelo R.

Furguiuele, currently pharmaco-
logist with Squibb International;

and Maureen J. O’Hara, current- I

1y at the Stanford Research In-

stitute. The report was presented .

at a special symposium, entitled
‘.‘Ethnopha'rmacologic Search for
Psycho-active Drugs,” held at the

-University of California, San

Francisco Medical Center.

‘According to the report. the
Kava Kava root is used by the
inhabitants of many islands of
the South Paciﬁc to produce a
beverage which is reported to al-
lay anxiety and reduce fatigue.

The researchers said that a
water soluble puriﬁed fraction
obtained from ‘Kava Kava pro-
duced marked taming eﬂccts in
aggressive rats, and decreased

the spontaneous activity of mice V

without altering their motor per-
formance.

Although the drug depressed
both activity of the cerebral cor-
tex and subcortical centers( hy-
pothalamus and hippocampus) of
the brain, the main site of ac-
tivity appeared to be in the more

‘ primitive subcortical areas.

Susan Scott, a senior French

> major from Pittsburgh served as

a translator and guide for Aleth
Lavaure and Jacqueline Bernard
who had come to Pittsburgh as
Price’s guest. Miss Lavaure is
the granddaughter of a French
couple that the former board
chairman lived with shortly af-
ter World War 1. After maintain-
ing a long-time friendship with
the couple and visiting them on
several occasions, he_ repayed
their hospitality by inviting Miss
Lavaure to his home. ,
As translator, Miss Scott ac-
companied Price and the two
girls to Ligonier and to the Roll-

by the Mellon family. They visit-
ed the Mellon stables, described
by Miss Scott _as a “medieval fort-
ress,” and Fort Ligionier, which
unfortunately, was closed.

“I wasn’t at all uncomfortable
with the group,” said Miss Scott,
“especially when I saw that the
girls were about my age. "They
helped me with my French, ﬁll-

ing Rock Country Club, owned-

ing in words when I had trouble V

translating. They spoke slowly, so
there was little problem, and

when we were at the Country -

Club I was saved" the biggest,  

translating problem of all: the "

menu. The club has Swiss wait-
ers.’

At the University Club the next
day at lunch with Dean Helen

Rush and the girls, Miss ’Sco_=tt. ~
did not have the beneﬁt of Swiss -

waiters. Although communication

was largely up to her, she admits, "

that everything went well.
Misses Lavaure and Bernard

were given a tour of the campus,

nationality ‘rooms and dormi-

tories. “They were amazed at the"

speed of the dorm elevators,” said

Miss Scott,

also amazed at the name: ‘Cathe-
dral of Learning.’

“I was very honored to be ask-=>

ed to accompany them,” she con-
tinued. “Mr. Price made every-

one ‘feel at ease, and everything V I
was so well planned. I think I
must have enjoyed the visit just"

as much as the girls did.”

  Survey Shows Students Pay

Increased Tuition and Fees

WASHINGTON,, D.C. (I.P.)—-Students at three out of
four state colleges and universities are paying higher tui-
tion, fees, room, and /or board charges this year than they
were last year. Surveys of student charges at the 97 mem-
bers of the National Association of State Universities and
Land-Grant Colleges and at the 206 members of the Asso-

ciation of State Colleges and Uni-
versities found that all but 19 of
the NASULGC members and all
but 59 of the ASCU members rais-
ed at least one charge to students
this fall.\-

The surveys’ figures were re-
leased by the Office of Institu-

tional Research. The surveys-

showed a 6.73 per cent increase
in in-state_tuition and required
fees at NASULGC institutions, up
from a median of $312 last year to
$333 this year. At ASCU institu-
tions, in-state tuition and required
fees showed a smaller increase,
but out-of-state rates jumped
sharply. In—state tuition and re-
quired fees at ASCU institutions
rose 4.16 per cent this year, from
$240 to $250; and out-of-state tui-
tion and required fees rose 10.46
per cent, from $478 to $528.

Room and board rate increases
varied widely, generally reflect-
ing national cost-of-living increas-
es, especially higher food prices

POETRY FORUM

The University of Pittsburgh
Press will publish the manuscript
of the poetry winners in Pitts-
burgh’s International Poetry For-
um’s first annual United States
Award.

Ally American citizen who has
never previously published a book
of poetry can send his entry to the

Forum between Feb. 1 and April‘
1. The prize -will be $2,000 and.

publication of the winning manu.
Script. The winner will be chosen
by Oct. 1, 1967.

 

   

 

and construction costs. Hardest
hit this year were women at ASCU
institutions. Their room rates rose
14.89 per cent, from $235 to $270;
and their board rates rose 6.89
per cent, from $365 to $390. Other
reasons for higher room and board
costs are higher employee salar-
ies and added services, such as
the. installation of telephones in
dormitory rooms. '

The most dramatic increase in
student charges in recent years
has come in out-of-state tuition
rates. This year’s 6.53 per cent
increase in out-of-state tuition and
required fees at NASULGC insti-
utions comes on top of a, huge

.19.9 per cent ‘jump last year. At

ASCU institutions, this year’s 10.46
per cent increase supplements
last year’s four per cent increase
in out-of-state tuition and required
fees. ‘

On the basis of recent trends, it
is hard to foresee-a widespread
leveling-off of tuition, room, and
board rates in the nearifuture. In
the last ten years, student charg-
es have risen 80 per cent, although
the cost of living has increased
only 17 per cent. ‘In addition, stu.
dents are paying a large? share
of their education today.

Another Day  

In his shy, diffident manner, Bob Petrini is laboring
under quite a burden this year. For Petrini and his fellow
teammates have been labeled the new order in Pitt basket-
ball. They represent the fruits of the biggest recruiting-ef-

fort in years. .

Petrini is from Washington, D.C. Charlie Hunt and Rob.
MacFarland were bred in Indiana. The geographic distri-
bution represents far-more than the Western Pennsylvania
orientation of the past. It represents areas where basket-
ball is king, instead of just an interlude be-
tween football seasons.

This is the real burden for Petrini. it’s
more than just the external pressure of
winning, it’s the internal adjustment to a
situation where basketball goes second class

and not ﬁrst.

‘ the good one.

That spirit is generated, ‘in part, by the team, the coach

and the home fans.

Tim Grgurich, the freshman coach and recruiter, knows
how to get his team up for a game. He has given them a
winning identity, but unfortunately the bulk of his inﬂu-
ence ceases once his boys. j oin the varsity.

Bob Timmons has demonstrated an inability in getting
his players excited about much ‘of anything. The atmos-
phere in the Athletic Department has demonstrated a lack
of "concern over the status of the winter sport. And the stu-
dent body has nearly disowned the basketball team.

Despite these factors, Petrini has confidence for the
future.- He feels that in two years, the Panthers will be win-
ning again and that people will take interest in them once
-they do. It’s this faith which has guided him and his team-
mates to a 9-2 record thus far. ' '

. , Bob played his high school bal1.f.or DeMath.a...W.hich is
just outside Washington‘. The Stags arethe perennial high

. school champs in D.C. and in Petrini’s senior year they were
26-1. It was DeMatha which dealt Lew Alcindor and Power
Memorial their only loss in three years. ' _

, “My high school coach told me that football was going
to be number one here,” said Bob. .“I was prepared for the
lack of interest here because other coaches trying to recruit
me kept pointing out all the bad points about Pitt.— —

kind of shocked by the crowd‘,

“At the ﬁrst game I was

In last week’s fraternity league
“A” action, the powerful Delta
Tau Delta team was almost up-
set by a spirited Sigma Chi team.

In that game, the difference be-
tween \the two teams was in
their foul shooting. Sigma Chi
was only able to convert three
out of 10 ﬂee throws, while the
Delts shot close to 815 per cent.
Ralph Manning was high man in
the game with 16 points. The

In other league games,_, Delta

Swimmers Drench

RICHARD GIBSON of Bucknell dives in his bid to\’
take a first in the one meter board. The dive was
good enough to edge out Dean Coleman for. first

The Bucknell swimming team came to
Trees’ Pool looking for their fifth straight

‘win, but the Panthers gave them a real
drowning the Bisons,

swimming lesson,
56-39.

‘In the first event, the 400 yard medley relay,
the swimmers jumped to an early 7-0 lead which
they never relinquished. After this, Bucknell con-
inually tried to stage a comeback but the ~mer‘men
held themback. In only two of the 11 events could
Bucknell gain more than a one point edge.

-~ In the locker room before the meet Coach Jerry
Snyder toldthe squad that they and Bucknell were
“two evenly matched teams” and that “each event
could go either way. Whoever gets psyched up the
most will win the meet,” said Snyder.

Snyder entered his top swimmer, John Lane,
in the 200 yard individual medley rather than the
freestyle events which he is accustomed to. Never-.
theless, Lane gave another strong showing taking
his 7th consecutive first place finish.

Chris Price tied for’ second place giving the
mermen seven of the nine points in the event.

Saturday’s track meet with

.Penn State reminded you of

Homecoming this year. The
Nittany Lions used plain
muscle, speed and ability to
overwhelm the track team, 74-26,
just as they had overwhelmed
the Panthers back in November.

The meet started on a fairly
good note. Greg Ellis took a ﬁrst
place in the shotput. It was the
ﬁrst victory in that event for the
trackmen since the days when
Jim Flanigan was throwing. Ellis
had to beat Flanigan’s varsity
record with a 52”/4” toss to do it.

John Farthing added a third
place in the high jump for a few

- more points, but the ﬁrst race

of the day indicated how things
would go on from there.
In a slow paced mile, Frank

_Ha.ndelman ran one of the most .-

disappointing races of his career,
ﬁnishing fourth , a. goodsix sec-
onds behind the winner. State’s
Bob Beam added another victory
for the visitors with a 6.3 sec-
ond, 60-yard’ dash. Chet Wojcie-

himself as Handelman had been,

“We were definitely a su-
perior team,” said coach
Warren N eiger following the
defeat of his gymnastics
team at Kent University last
Saturday. Neiger based this con-

tradiction on what he termed
inept judges.

The gymnasts tallied by far
their highest score of the sea-
son, 164.40, but coach Neiger ad-
mitted it was not indicative of
the team’s ability. The gymnasts
have been averaging in the low
140’s all season.

“The boys performed well, how-
ever, especially Jim Sacco.” Sac-
co won in the all-around divi-
sion and placed ﬁrst on the side
horse and still rings, and ﬁnish-
ed second on the high bars. Dave
Shidemantle took second on the
trampoline and the long horse
vault. Ig Perez ﬁnished in. a ﬁrst-
place tie in the free exercises.

Niegers main criticism of the
judges was their inconsistency.
“When a boy did a bad job,
they didn’t cut them down
enough. All the kids were actual-
ly getting gifts. There was in my

 

eyes, no nine point performances,
although the‘ judges gave out
many.”

Because Pitt is a member of
the Eastern Incollegiate Gymnas-
tic League, the gymnasts are used
to strict adherence to the rules.
All the judges must take exams
and have a meeting once a year
to go over the rules.

Kent is an independent. The
four judges that were there had
very little idea of how to score
and no previous training. Nei-
ther team was cable of scoring
that high a score.

The gymnasts had a slight lead

maining in Saturday's wrestling
meet at Trees Hall, Raglin re-
covered his composure and pin-
ned Raklewicz to give Army a
20-16 win.

“I thought Rak did’ a terriﬁc
job,” said coach Dave Johnson
afterwards. “If he had only been
outaweek...” It

Raklewicz was drafted Thurs-
day afternoon after the wrest-
lers’ regular heavyweight Toby
Hensgen was sidelined with a
hyperextended elbow.

Rak had led, 1-0, going into
the ﬁnaliperiod of his match, and
with a minute left, it looked as
if he could manage a. draw, giv-
ing the matmen an.18-17 win.
Then the bubble burst.

The fans sensed a possible up-
set, when ﬁve seconds in the
ﬁrst match Rich Shildt took a
2-0 lead on Army’s Jim Byrnes
which he never lost, Winning 7-4. .

f‘Shildt wrestled real aggresive-
ly,” said Johnson. “I think he
set the tone of the match for the
other guys.”

With the exception of Larry
Cuba at 130, the wrestlers didn’t
lose another match until 167.

Ron Schuchert dominated Ca-
det Ken Hughes for a 7-0 win at
137; Tom Roberts capitalized on
a point for Army stalling in the
ﬁnal 15 seconds to win 5-4; Tim
Traux held on in the third per-
iod for a point riding time and
a 5-5 draw, while Jim Rhone
lost a 5-1 lead and drew 6-6.

After building a 13-9 lead, the
wrestlers were able to win only
one match of the last four. At

From F arcical To Serious, 

  LaValley

From an ugly duckling,
Jim LaValley has turned in-

to a beautiful white swan.

_ When LaValley first saw varsity
basketball actionas a sophomore,
he was a most uncoordinated
ballplayer. Usually it took him
five seconds to make-up his mind
to either shoot or pass to a team-
mate. When he brought down a
rebound, he invariably seemed to
lose possession of the ball or pass
it to an opposing player. In fact,
the ugly duckling never was sure
what to do.

LaValley was so uncoordinated
in that first year, he broke the
basket rim during a pre-game
warm-up. I

Now things have changed. And
Where the ugly duckling would get
boxed-out by those taller guys
under the boards, the white swan
LaValley does quite a job against
those six-eleven and six-ten op-

ponents. He has consistently out .

jumped and out rebound the
“shorter” six-niners and six-
eighters.

“He’s our top workhorse,” said

head coach Bob Timmons who has
witnessed LaValley’s develop-
ment over the past three years.

“He’s starting to reach the point
now where he is a pretty decent
basketball player,” Timmons said.
“Now he’s rebounding and scor-
ing points.”

The statistics verify Timmons
statements. Through 16 games, he
has scored 202 points and needs
only ten points to equal his'ca-
reer high. He already has equal-
ed his rebound mark of 200.

Improves Routine

“They’re hammering us on the.
boards,” LaValley said in hi
quiet, mild spoken manner. “W
try to box them out and. get _
lot of taps off the shots.” I .

LaValley certainly isn't iryin
to be cocky when he says, 3
could out jump anyone my size.’i..
Its just that he talks with confi
dence now and is proud of 
evolution. ‘ -

He doesn’t shoot much in a gang
except when he’s hot and then he
uses a jump shot from anywherv
outside the key. In three of th ;
last four games, he has led th"
Panthers in scoring with 16, ; 1
and 16 points. 

LaValley’s first two seasons were.’
the hardest because a lot of spec-
tators got on his back. ‘But ca__
calls didn’t turn him against the,
game, they helped him gro 
“That stuff doesn’t bother me,”‘
he said. “I go out there to play

In those first two seasons, hé.
seemed to be more at home in ia‘;
a prone position rather than¥an:
erect one, because he either tri I‘
ped or fell. Again this season, h

I has been following the sarne pa
tern, but for a different reason. _

Now he is going after the ball‘
“I just dive for it because eithe
I get it or the other guy will and’?
coach yells at us if we don’t,” La
Valley said. ' 

An interesting thing about La-
Valley is that he earned three.
letters in track while he attended
Shaler High in Glenshaw, Pa. And
although he never attempted var"-9
sity_ competition, he unofficially
holds the school high jump record;

JIM LaVALLEY
A much improved player.

_ LaValley’s rebounding markis
over double that of any of his
teammates, and one reason for
this is he is a tremendous leaper.
He may well be the best jumper
on the team _in many years.

At six-foot-six, he is the tallest
player on the team. And because
he plays a full game every time,
he can best describe the action
under the basket.

"Kricli Presents Beckett

 Krapp’s Last Tape, written by Samuel Beckett and giv-
V’ en by the Friday Night Theater, should be the play to see
rthisweek. Do not go to see it however for light entertain-
7_ment, or to see John Krich, take up‘_the ornate gloves of
-Shakespearian or Jacobean gesture, duplicating his per-
-iod” performances in Duchess of Malfi and Mary Stuart,

looms larger than the man, and it
is with a kind of horror invisible
in the text of the play that we see
the old man and his younger self
confronting over these spools of
celluloid like a warlock and his
familiar.

Krich’s voice is a more than
adequate vehicle for Beckett’s
purposes. The actor has an al-
most infallible sensitivity for di-
viding the farcical and self-con-
scious “poetry” that the 30-year
old voice spouts from time to
time, from the true poetry —
drawn out as if under a trance
from some indefinable reel of
pain in the young man——of re-
membered act of love. The old
man replays it over and over, pro-
viding‘ a counterpoint — and this
effect is purely Krich’s.creature
— of words soundlessly along the
tape.

This is a.sufficiently minor ex-
ample of Krich’s attention to
technique and initiative—It makes
we suspect that Krich essentially
reduces his parts to a formula of

gesture, and that he regards Beck-__
ett, as he should -— as no hollier

nor less sacred in the breakdown
of his theater, than Webster or
Shakespeare.

Len Powlick deserves a good
part of the applause for his hand-
ling of the technical problems in-
volved in the play; a tape-record-
er is not the easiest prop to use,
nor is talking to himself the least
wearing device an actor must

"contend with. This play CAN be

miserably done. On the basis of
last Friday night’s performance,
you would never know it.

history. How we turned what was basically a one-product

5 fold in 10 years. How we now have 100 plants in the _
