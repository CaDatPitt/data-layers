From the crest of the Universi'ty
Campus, the new Medical Building,
the latest triumph of architecture of
our proposed group, overlooks the
Engineering Building an'd School of
Mines Building on the East and the
area laid aside for Tree’s Standium on
the North. The View from the wind-
ows of the new building is magniﬁ-
cen't, the beautiful new structures‘ of
Schenley Farms, the Carnegie Tech-
nical Schools, the new building ofthe.

Memorial Hall and other buildings

in a vI'ew of a large city.

The statue on the North end of the
building represents Assculapius, who
in Greek Mythology is called the
Father of Medicine. -From his high
advantage, this venerable Ancient,
holding in one handtthee writhing serp-

surveys in quiet dignity our Campus
and shows by his kindly smile,',the
interest he holds for ‘the great pro-
fession. ' V

The Medical Building was ﬁnished
late in 1910, and the architecture is
the same as that in the two com-
pleted buildings; the outside is of
white stone, brick and tile with dull

doors; the inside is entirely of'whi‘te

Band Bill

At the beginning of the last foot-
ball season the treasurers of all classes
in all departments were authorized ‘to
collect from every student the s.um of
twenty ﬁve cents for the purpose of
paying the bands engaged for the
football games. At the time a. sum
amounting to about sixty dollars was
realized by the various class ofﬁcer-s.
The seasoncanie and the band,played.
Now, the cheer leader is coinfronte-d
with the problem of raising the re-
mainder of the band fund, which
amounts to about two hundred and
ﬁftyydollars. Had the assessment
been paid by all the studen'ts, the bill
of the musicalmen could have been
very easily met, but some of the -de-
partments. demurred at the prospect
of paying that, which seemed the place
of the athletic committee to se‘ttle.
The athletic authorities took a differ-
ent view of the matter and thought it
was the students’ duty “'to pay the
ﬁddler.” Regardless of the respective
merits of the case, it seems highlylap—
parent that someeffort be ma’de to re—
lease the cheer leader, who is, by the
terms of thecontract, personally re—
sponsible for the debt incurred, from
‘the liability. .

There is a‘very serious side to the
affair, which should not be lost sight
of in the heat of an argument over the
proper source of payment. Mr. Kirk
is in a position of considerable em-
barrasment solely because he did his
duty and it appears exceedingly pert-
inent, that the stn'den'ts rally about
him and contribute the sum needed to
balance the band bill.

l -
l The members of the track team met
lat the request of the retiring Captain,
ill‘. E. Ross last VVednesday to elect
lthe leader of ‘the team for the current
lyear. The man decided upon to as-
sume the captaincy was H. O. Bryson,
of the Junior class, who has performed
creditably on the cinder path ‘during
the last two seasons. The new cap-
tain was one of the members of the
crack relay team which went to Phila-
delphia last spring and displayed such
excellent form against ‘the Carlisle
Indians and other teams of like rank,
Coach Thompson has not intimated
his plans for the season soon to open,
but it may be expected that the leader
of the football eleven will soon ‘devote
his energy to the ‘track men.

The limited facilities with which to
properly train men for track work
throws a Herculean task upon the
shoulders of the Coach each year, but
it appears as if this is the ﬁnal time
‘of hardship as the Trees gymnasium
will certainly eliminate ‘the difficulty‘
experienced in the past with the track
work.

H. E. Ross, who retires’ as captain,
was one of the most’ capable -men in
the history of track athletics; a will-
ing worker and an excellent director
of the men.

THE PITT

WEEKLY

_ Owl Sends 0ut'Letter

Circular Letter Soliciting Aid of

, Students is Distributed Last
Week—-Plea Made for Adver-
tiser. ‘

 

‘ ‘The Weekly has been requested ‘to J
< publish the following letter, which
. was widely circulated last week among

all ‘departments:

The Owl Board of 1912 is. going to
put out the best Owl that has ever
been published. Sounlds big, doesn’t
it?» VVell it is big. The Universi’ty.is
doing things big all the way through.
When you look at the magniﬁcent
buildings erected on the new campus

, within the last two years you mus.t

admit that it is a big star't for a big
University. Even better that; that
though, is the fact that the standard

* of the University is being raised an'd

‘the standard of the Owl must advance
‘with it, yes lead it! Now dear fellow
student, we need .your help to do this.
\Will you give it?

The Owl Board is willing to work
hard an‘d sacriﬁce much to attain the
desired end, but in order to do so we
must have help. That we need money
n_eed hardly be mentioned. There are.

two sources of revenue. The sale of
books and the sale of a'dver'tising
space. You do not want an Owl un-

less it: is a good one and the adver
tiser will not advertise unless it has a
big circulation. It is up to you to
subscribe for an Owl and establish the
circulation. We shall expect this as
r a matter of course. ,
We of course, ask you to help us

in another way. A complete list of.
~ advertisers in the last year’s Owl has

been distributed among the students.
We ask you to study this list care-
fully and when making purchases, 'to
patronize the advertisers. Further
than that we ask that every time you
,do so, impress the ‘fact that you are
patronizing him because he patronized
the Owl. In this. way the merchant
will be convinced 'that his advertising
is bringing results and will be willing
to give us an advertisement again
next year and the year after. By pur-
suing this metho'd we will be able to
secure a large number. of advertisers
which in turn means s.ufﬁcient funds to
publish the best Owl ever put‘ out.
Yours for Co-operation, '
The 1912-Owl Board.

Held at the Rittenhouse.

The Jlinior Prom will be held, Fri-
dayevening the seventeenth of Febru-
ary, in‘the Rittenhouse, is the an-
nouncement of the
pointe'd to arrange for the annual
dance given by the Junior class. The
members of the committee are made

thused at ‘the prospect of having the
banner Junior s.ocial event of years.

The committee is now at work get-
ting signers on the blanks provided
for the names of the men who will
pledge themselves for attendance.
This is a new departure and one that
seems highly commendable, in that
i't affords the committee a basis. upon
which to work in making the prelimi-
nary arrangements.

The committee is composed of the
following members: J. E. Sloan,

NOTRE DAME MAY PLAY HERE

Graduate Manager Hurst Assures
Athletic Committee Schedule Will
Contain High-class Elevens.

Graduate Manager Hurst h'as,as-
sured ‘the members. of the athletic
committee that his football schedule
for next fall will be the best in years.
He expects to receive ﬁnal decision
regarding one important game this
week and is about ready to sign up
with another team of national fame.
It is said ‘that this is. the Carlisle In-
dians, although no ‘deﬁnite statement
could be secured to this effect.

Notre Dame is’ anxious to come
here next fall and may be accommo-
dated. Virginia Polytechnic Institute,
a fast Southern team of s'tanding
equal to Georgetown, is also anxious
for a game. In all, there should be
at least ﬁve important games and the
remaining four or ﬁve with the small-
er colleges will be better than the av-
erage. An effort will be m-ade to weed
out ‘the weaker teams and substitute
teams of a little better class for the

early seas.on contests.

Third Year Men Meet Monday
to Arrange Details for the Owl

and the Prom.

The Junior class held an important
meeting Monday morningto perfect
arrangements for the annual dance

on the progress of the Owl. The
Editor of the Owl made a very urgent
reques.t upon the members to have
their photos taken as soon as possible
that the work of engraving might not
be delayed by the late comers.

The president called ‘the attention
of the members of the class to the
memorial fund which was started at
the time of the clas.s banquet last
year for the purpose of erec'ting upon
the campus a permanent testimonial
‘to 1912. The class was informed that
the steps toward the realization of
the scheme were being made ’diPﬁcult
by the failure of many to comply with
the original ﬁnancial plans of the ﬁn-
ance committee. Reports of commit-
tees appointed to confer with the.
Senior class. were also heard.

IT ,wAs A CASE OF'PAY-

Students Find Registration a Time to
Produce the Real Cash.

A notice which was sent to all the
members of the faculty last week.
very_ plainly defined that the students
must show their registration cards
properly receipted before being allowed
entrance to a class. The rule has been

"heard of before in this institution,

but the success was never noticeable.
Last week, however, the scenes were
very much changed and‘ the beauty of
the decree was. sadly evident to the
fellow who had neglected to receive
the paternal check in time. Seriously
speaking, the plan is an excellent one
and should always work in the future.

NAME IS INJUSTICE

In a Pittsburgh paper, the othef
evening, there appeared an item under
the date line of Morgantown, West
Virginia, in which the virtutes of the

‘University of West Virginia baseball
‘tteani ‘were made quite conspicuous

and among the ﬁrs.t things to greet

»'the eye of the reader was the state-

ment that, “the first game was to be
played with the Pittsburgh Indepen'd—

—. ents, representing the University of

Pit*tsburgh"s baseball strength.” The

f mere mention of the Universi'ty of
. West Virginia’s promising baseball
 situation does not call, to be sure, for

any comment at our hands-—we hope

they win all their games, but what of

this team representing the strength
of the Universi'ty of Pittsburgh? If

tention to Remarks ‘on the
Chemical Solution of Life.

Before an audience. which com-

lTihaw Hall, last Friday morning, Pro-
jfessor Robert Kennedy Duncan de-
llivered the premier address of the

Epresent year on the theme of “As

It
iprobably not exaggerating the fact,
iwhen it is said that no speaker has
lever held the marked at'tention of the
students so thoroughly as
Duncan did last week. It would be
futile to attempt an analysis of the
excellent talk given to the students
presen't in chapel; the man or woman
who missed the lecture must reconcile
;the los.s with the determination to at-
‘tend the next‘ time. The argument
presented was in some cases not in

lChemical Solution of Life.”

lpresent, yet the masterful ‘exposition
10f the speaker sent one away with the
lfeeling that something a little different
‘had been learned. -
The context of Doc’tor Duncan’s re-
marks, was, very roughly, that life or
living matter is not biological or
physiological in "character, but chem-
ical, that the contents of the sea water
iare the same as the constituen'ts of
{the human body; in our blood we
carry the sea water of the ancient day
of creation. Reaching a conclusion,
that these chemical elements were
combined in one of the following three
ways.: ﬁirst, by a Divine chemist who
moulded the coi1sti’tLients; second, the
mobile constituents moulded them-
selves or thir’d, they came naturally
but not inherently and were under
Divine guidance. The ﬁrst two be-
ing disproved and the last retained.
The transmitive theory of William
James and ‘the directive theory of life
by Lodge were dis,cusse’d as a prelim-

ginary for the startling conclusion that I
‘life is inductive in character and not,
l . . .

;as the two great authorities ment1on— ~

,ed said, either transmitive or ‘deriva-
itive.

ltention of every one present and thei
lurgent request that the speaker con—f
.; tinue when the time assigned him had '
lexpired, is sufﬁcient proof of the ap-:

gpreciation of the students.

THE PITT WEEKLY

Plea is Made for Regular Meet-1

ing Hour —-«State Secretary
Coming Here to Visit.

‘Speaking for the Y. M. C. A. one
day last week, Halleck 12, made a
very good point in the way the as-
socia'tion has been treated since the
new chapel plan went into effectvlast
It seems. only fair, that the or-
ganization be given its proper time of
meeting, and that it was taken away
by over-zealous professors and stu-
dentsis sufﬁcient cause for ‘the plea
ma’de in its behalf. -

The Y. M. C. A. is a splendid or-
ganization designed to create an in-
terest in college men; its forces reach
into every country of the glo-be, where

civilization is known. That such a
powerful fact-or for good should be
shut out of -our insjtitution for the
lack of a suitable hour of meeting,
does not seem consistent with the

Announcement was made at the
same meeting, that the State secre-
tary is shortly to be here an’d that

plans. are being made to have the;
local branch in tip—top shape for the

coming of the executive officer. There
is one way in which every man in the
University can lend assistance and
tha't is. to join the “Y.” for the re-
maining months of the year; the bene-
fits to be derived from such an act
ought to be a ready recompense for
the sum expended. There is no4reas-
on why the Y. M. C. A. in the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh cannot take rank
with the leading associations of i‘ts
kind in the country. ~ ’ -

Assurances have been granted tha
the time of the Y. M. C. A. meeting
will not be encroache‘d upon in the fu-
ture and that the regular leaders will
be heard every Monday morning as
advertised. The thing to do now is to
put our shoulders to the wheel and
boost.

STORY SOUNDS WELL 1

Statement Appearing in Pittsburgh i
Paper is not A-ccredited--Logic
Makes Good Reading but
Lacks Facts.

The students of the University were
somewhat wrought up over the story
.of a Pittsburgh paper the other inorn—
ing, when the sporting editor placed
the University -of Michigan eleven
on our schedule for next fall. The
article has all the rosiness of a real
game being s.che'duled, but it is sadly
lacking in fact. We are going to have
a very much improved list of games
next fall, but it is hardly fair to jar
the equilibrium of the undergraduates

in such a startling manner. Ap-
pended is the “strong” points of the
arguments used by the sporting:
writer: ’

If the Penn game is stricken off the 3
Michigan schedule what will the Wol-
verines do for an Eastern game? The
conclusion reached is that Michigan
will request a game with Pitt, and i
it is rumored that this has been done. A;
Pitt-Michigan struggle stage'd in this
city would be. one of the strongest
drawing cards that could be arranged,
and it is. hardly likely that the local
management will overlook the oppor-

tunity to book them up. Owing to
the fact ‘that Michigan is out of the»
Westernc-onference it has to look.
elsewhere for games. '

NUGGET CLUB IS FORMED

The Nugget Club, an honorary'so-
cietyi in the school of mines. is the
latest addition to the student organ-
izations of the University. The ob-
ject of the club is primarily to en-
courage high standards of scholarship
in the University, especially in the‘
school of mines and to meet the*need 
of a student mining society, where
simple mining problems migh‘t be dis-
cussed by the menibers an'd more com-
plex ones answered by visiting engin-
eers.

The first meeting of the club will be
held in Room 103. Thaw Hall, this
evening (Wednesday,) at eight o’clock.
The following program has been pre-
pared:

H. N. Eaton—Geol’Ogy of Western
i\-iontana—-illustrated. I
