Reading Period Added
To Fall, Spring Terms
At Committee’s Request

A two-day reading period before finals’ week has been
inserted into the 1965-66 calendar for the fall and spring
terms. The period was requested by the Student Affairs
Committee and unanimously supported by Men’s Dorm Council.

Vice-chancellor Alan Rankin reported that the Monday and Tues-
day before Wednesday’s start of exams, will be set aside during these
two terms. Finals start on Monday during the winter trimester, so

that the weekend break was con-
sidered sufficient here. — g

The Student Affairs Committee
considered a draft of faculty
policy on academic integrit. This
six-page paper presents a positive
commitmentto an atmosphere of
integrity on the part of the fac-
ulty, a deﬁnition of deviations
from this idea on the part of the
students, and the standards by
which a professor should, gauge
his classroom atmosphere. It con-
cludes with a system of handling
violations.

Dr. Rankin reported that the
faculty showed “spirited debate
and comment” at the Senate meet-
ing where the draft was ﬁrst pre-
sented. They were concerned
about the problem itself, but dis-
agreed as to how the enforce-
ment of the code should be work-
ed out. They made a distinction
in attitude between the graduate
and undergraduate divisions: in
the ﬁrst, expectations are higher
because of professional codes, and
penalities are immediate; where-
as in the second, the violation

may be considered equally as ser-

ious but the punishment might
be more lenient.

Student Government president
John Vr.ana suggested that a joint
committee of administration, fac-
ulty, and students sit as a review
board for the most serious cases

~ of dishonesty, but Dean Helen

Rush and Dean William Crafts
questioned this technique in a
situation that ’could probably be
handled more constructively on a
personal level.

The Committee agreed that the
mechanics were less important
than the attitude, and that the
faculty must support the idea
-positively in the classroom be-
fore the students can identify

with the value.

Lawrence Monnett, Jr., vice-
chancellor of business affairs,
will meet with the Student Af-
fairs Committee at a special
luncheon meeting November 20,
to discuss appropriations to stu-
dent organizations, invoice dif-
ﬁculties, and the possibilities of
a student discount at the Book
Center.

Women’s Panel Discusses
Proposal for Off-Campus
Housing, Curfew Removal

A panel of six students will
discuss the question of oif-cam-
pus housing for women students
over 21 and the elimination of
curfews for senior women, Wed-
nesday at 7 p.m. in 1228 CL.

The proposals provide that
women students 21 years of age
or over before the ﬁrst day of
a trimester may live off campus,
and that women students with
90 or more credits may be ex-

empted from curfew regulations if
they are over 21, and with their

parents’ permission if they are.

under 21.

Panel members in favor of the
proposals will include Betty Big-
elow, Jane Gould, and Janet Re.
Speaking against the proposals
will be Ann Boisclair, Suzanne

Garszczynski, and Bonnie Mei-
krantz.

Russia Topic at Midday Series

Dr. Harry Schwartz, New York

The Time’s specialist on Soviet
affairs since 1951, Dr. Schwartz
has written six books on Russian
history, politics, and economics.
One of his books, Russia’s Soviet
Economy, has been used for many
years as the standard American
university text on that topic.

Dr. Schwartz, who is a former
professor of economics at Syra-
cuse University, received his B.A.,
M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from —
New York's Columbia University, .

He has served in the State De-

ﬁce of Strategic Service), in the
U.S. Department of Agriculture,
and on the War Production Board.
Dr. Schwartz, has also traveled
extensively throughout the So-
viet Union, Eastern Europe, and
Latin America, including a. trip

to Cuba after the Castro regime

came into power.

From the time of the kickoff 6‘
speech until now, the J ohnstown ’ _
area has raised $1.3 million for‘ :1 T9
the new campus, apparently on_._g:’i
the assumption that when com-. -11.2,
pleted, the college would be-_a 

degree-granting school.

The University, however, says" 
no such committment was made. , ,

Although the Chancellor could
not be reached for comment,

Richard Rose, coordinator of re- ‘

gional Campus programs, said
that he knows of no promise ‘by
the University to grant four-year,
degree status to Johnstown. Rose
did say that While in Johnstown
for a visit some time ago, he did
see pamphlets, apparently pub-
lished there, which strongly 

plied that Johnstown’s new cam.-1
pus would be a four-year school.
The Panther editorial observed;

“Has the Chancellor reneged or
have we been misled by our own
scant hopes?”

NAAWP Head Speaks
To Tower’s Audience

By PETE HORN

Harvey F. Johnston, President of the National Asso-
;ciation for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP)

began his talk in the Tower A lobby Wednesday evening

__byapologizing, “I admit I’m no orator.” He distributed a
leaﬂet the poor spelling and grammar of which could not

be blamed on any typesetter. Nonetheless, he managed to

communicate his opinions to his

largely unappreciative audience.

— Johnston's’ basic contention,

‘strongly Social Darwinistic in

both tone and content, was that

_'Negroes upset the competitive

spirit of the free enterprise sys-
tem ‘by wedging their way into
whites’ jobs. He believes also

 that Negroes, via the NAACP,
1, "Civil Rights Bill and white “Do-
A. JGooders,”

_, impinge on others’
 rights of privacy and selective
; 1  association.

“The colored people,” Johnston

- said, “are well organized. There
 -is no counter - organization for

wh-ite people. The only way we’re
going to get anything is to band

I together. We must see that no

more of our rights are taken

If _ away than have already been

taken away.

“To require equality in every-
thingisselling communism. We’re
heading fast for Russia to take
over if people don’t sit down and
talk this over. If the racial prob-
lem did get out of control, it
would be a very easy thing for
the U.N. or Cuba to come in and
take over. The UN. supersedes
the United States Constitution,
you know.”

A student asked him if he had
read the Civil Rights Bill. He
said, “I have read enough of the
bill. Well, there’s a lot of things
I haven’t read, this is a pretty

‘ .big worl .”

People, Johnston said, should
devote themselves primarily, to
their own “households,” and

then to those of their own kind.

Makes Student Hunting Easier

By MARGIE DONALDSON
and MARY GARCAR

Recent reclassiﬁcation in
expansion in the University

Bookstore have made it easi-
er for students to ﬁnd the books
they want.

“We try to consider the per-
son We are working for — the
student—and attempt to make
things complete, yet as uncom-
plicated as possible,” explains
John Balagna, manager of the
Bookstore.

The Bookcenter has expanded
both the paperback and refer-
ence-book departments. Almost
5,000 paperbounds have been
added. Eventually, the store also
hopes to offer reference texts in
all academic .areas, but present-
ly the selection includes mainly
mathematics, science, and engi-
neering.

The classical record department
is also being improved, according
to Balagna. Featuring records not
usually stocked elsewhere, the

Curb Cut Priority
‘NO PARKING signs have been
placed in areas where curbs have
been cut away to allow wheel
chair students to have an easier
time getting around campus. On
Bigelow Boulevard the curb cuts
are accompanied by a cross-walk.

Bookstore’s selection includes rec-
ords for music appreciation
courses, children’s records, foreign
language records, and Shakes-
pearian Series records. The Ar-
chive Productions contain re-
cordings of Baroque music, Gre-
gorian chants, and early Renais-
sance music.

One of the most important jobs
of the Bookstore is to provide
required textbooks in sufficient
quantities. Books which have run
out are obtained special delivery
from the publisher and are re-
placed within several days. If the
Bookstore does not carry a book

which a student wants, it can be
ordered for him at no additional
cost.

“Our main purpose is to get
the student to read more—we

aren’t only interested in selling.

backs,” Balagna stated. Lounge
chairs have been placed on the
retail ﬂoor to encourage students
to come in and browse.

In addition to a large number
of foreign journals and maga-
zines regularly subscribed to,
special displays are frequently
organized. The selection of books
and paperbounds on Johnson and
Goldwater was, Balagna believes,
one of the largest and most bal-
anced found in Pittsburgh. »

“These are just some of the
advantages of a bookcenter this
size and this complete,” con-
cluded Balagna.

Bobby Rydell Admits

Insecurity at Concert

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

When Bobby Rydell sang
before the Homecoming au-
dience at Carnegie Hall last
Friday night, he was unsure of
himself. He was unsure because
it was his ﬁrst concert, his ﬁrst
time performing before college
students, and the ﬁrst time he
sang before an audience that he
knew nothing about.

Backstage before the concert,
the reddish-brown haired 22-
year-old _admitted he was ner-
vous. “I’m not sure exactly what
the kids want to hear,” he said
apprehensively. ~

Rydell was also uncertain about
how to perform before a collegi-
ate audience. He wasn’t sure if
his tuxedo was the proper at-
tire; nor was he sure about wh.at
he should say, or how he should
say it. This was apparent when
he walked onto the stage and
stuttered, - “Good evening ladies
and gentlemen. I . , uh . . I want
to . . uh . . thank you very much.”

“I knew I started slow,” Ry-
dell admitted after the show. “I
wasn’t sure about what would go
over, but I think I picked up.”

Because he knew nothing about

his audience, he couldn’t be sure
of what they wanted to hear.
After the concert he knew. Stu-
dents received his popular songs
with respect. They applauded
“Volare” and “World Without
Love,” and some even expressed
disappointment at his not sing-
ing “Wild One” and “Kissin’
Time.”

Bobby Rydell is a talented mu-
sician. He went to his Friday
nighht concert blind. As soon as
he learns what the college crowd
w.ants to hear, he will be as suc-

cessful on the campus as he is
at the Copa.

_ The Chancellor is in an embarrassing position now that one of the docile regional.
fcampuses has found its vocal cords. And it is a propos that it is Johnstown, the oldest
 one, that has started asking questions.

It -seems obvious to people on the Oakland campus just what the function of these
 iregionals is: they have been described as branches of the University serving their
1'1  areas of Pennsylvaiii'a, offering a basic liberal arts background for the more special-.
 ized undergraduate courses at the main campus. There are some graduate and pro-
 fessional programs at the regional campuses, but primarily, to the Oakland campus’s
knowledge, they have basic English, language, and distribution courses in preparation
for more advanced work here. ‘ I

But unfortunately this is not so clear to the people it affects, for they are under

 ‘the impression that this is only the beginning. The editor of the Johnstown student

newspaper asked in its latest issue, “Is it possible that the Chancellor has turned his

151. back on us? Has (he) reneged or have we been misled by our own scant hopes?”

When the Chancellor needed the community ’s money, probabilities for a four-year cam-
pus seemed high. But things don't look so good now, and they are questioning.
From all reports, the Chancellor has never promised a four-year development to

A any of the regional campuses. He did speak of developing physical plant, and this he has

done-Johnstown broke ground last month for extensive campus plans. He might have

I‘ said that any policy is flexible and therefore there seemed a possibility that the regional

campuses might specialize. But, to our knowledge, there has never been a definite com-

mitment.

We are not questioning the function of the regional campuses, but we must agree
with the J ohnstown students that this confusion as to their function is unfair. The
Chancellor cannot say that he told the people of J ohnstown that their campus would
eventually be a complete undergraduate program, but the fact that he never denied it
has let them hope too much. Now, rather than the J ohnstown students having a posi-
tive attitude about what they do have, they’re growing indifferent because they’re not

  getting more.

Expansion is beautifully impersonal until people balk and start questioning.

They deserve, a clear answer.

Personality Plus

The Image Builder  

By Alex D’lppolito

For an election that was

. supposed to give the Ameri_-

can voters a clear choice, the
only thing that it really gave
them was confusion.

With both sides eagerly ’

dipping into the sewer ‘for
anything and everything

" , they could scoop up, the cam-

paign quickly switched from
any is s u e s
that did exist
into a contest
between. two
personalities.
And Gold-
water’s per-
sonality, or
more accur-
ately — the
" threat of
DTPPOI-IT0 Goldw at er,
became the central issue.
Using an image of Gold-

 

 a . water so conveniently creat-

ed by prominent anti-Gold-
water Republicans and by
some of the more liberal
members of the nation's
press,_ Lyndon Johnson chose
to build his campaign around

lie I, this Goldwater image in-
. stead of around any ideolog-

ical differences that existed
between himself and Mr.
Goldwater.

AMERICANS, SAID the

  President in his campaign,

are not presented with “a

. choice of liberalism and con-

servatism,” but instead are

if. being asked to choose “be-

tween the center and the
fringe——between the respon-

sible mainstream of Ameri- -

can experience and the reck-
less and rejected extremes.”

«Helpful Hubert, the Presi-
dent’s running mate and one
of the nation's foremost
moderates,’-’ helped the cause

7 by saying that Goldwater “is

not a true Republican, not a

_ conservative, but a radical.”

So the Goldwater image

1 I which the voters were asked

to decide upon was that of a
radical, racist, bigot, war-

" -monger, __paran_oid, old‘-people _

A the globe.

 

hater, poor people hater, fac- '

ist, irresponsible maniac,

‘ right wing extremist -— in

short a dirty guy.

This is what the American
people soundly rejected. So
what else is new?

THEREFORE, LYNDON
J ohnson’s’ vote was more of
an anti-Goldwater vote rath-
er than a pro-Johnson vote.
Ironically, all the vote-get-
ting records which the Pres-
ident set were the result of
a negative mandate from the
people.

With a spokesman who
could have maintained a bet-
ter image and had been more
articulate in communicating
his ideas than was Goldwa-
ter, the conservative cause
might, though not necessari-
ly, have made more progress
than it did.

In their pre-election sur-
veys, the pollsters, who made
up’ for their miscalculations
on the Republican primaries
by accurately predicting the
Johnson landslide, found
many people who were re-
ceptive to a more conserva-
tive doctrine than their anti-
Goldwater vote would seem
to indicate.

There were voters polled
who felt that maybe govern-
ment is getting a little too
big; that some relief and

welfare programs do have a .

somewhat demoralizing ef-
fect on their recipients; that
with all the large deﬁcit
spending there are still a few
people unemployed; that
there is a justiﬁcation for
alarm over the rapidly rising
crime rates; that a quick
nose count around the world
would seem to suggest that
United States foreign policy
hasn’t accomplished to much
in the last 20 years, and that
it is a phony peace at best
as long as American soldiers
are dying halfway around

But still they indicated
their preference for Johnson.

AND THERE were also
those polled who did not ﬁnd

themselves inspired with
' Lyndon J ohnson’s leaders-hip

and who had slight doubts
about the President's char-
acter. Few parents were
found who could point With
pride to the man in the
White House and say to jun-
ior “Be like him.” Maybe
they would want junior to
be where he he is — but not
as he is.

However, they still said
they would vote for ohnson.

All this leads one to con-
clude that the Republican
party made too -many mis-
takes for its own good, and
although it is easy to knock
a man when he is down,
Goldwater's disregard for
many time - tested political
rules also contributed to his
_own overwhelming defeat.

The same product that
-Goldwater tried to sell, with
slight modiﬁcations, a new
label, and a diﬂferent ribbon
tied around it, may still some
day be bought by the Amer-
ican people.

  Mu.-are  

 

By Al Janesic

There was an air of magic in the Stadium last Satur-
day that had-n’t been there for three years. Notre Dame
was back for the first time since 1961 and suddenly Home-
coming seemed secondary. The spell that Notre Dame
wove begun at- 12:50 p.m. when a gold helmet bobbed
through the gate of theconcourse exit. It was hard to

tell who first noticed it. But people
jerked their heads from programs
and let the mustard from hot dogs
drip on their shoes.

“Here they come,” someone said.
And ‘just as concessionaires started
barking their wares, Waves of‘ South
Bend partisans rose ’round the Sta-
dium with a roaring crescendo.

Half the Stadium was up. Little

-old ladies clutching sweaters squeak-
:30 31311‘ fillpproval. A greeiii-clad tyke
e a orn; some c ose a prayer-

P‘ JANFZIC book and even a rabbi smiled.

The Irlsh Were on the field—all of ’em: Wolski, Nicola,
J eziorski, Maglicic, Kostelnik, Zurowski, Wengieoski, Mit-

telhauser and Paternostro, (thrown in for good luck.).

A FEW MINUTES later Pitt came onto the ﬁeld while
people wiped the mustard from their shoes and glanced
back to their programs. Then, just when everyone was
getting used to seeing Notre Dame's cheerleaders doing
ﬂ_ips on a springboard, six six-footers stepped onto the
cinder track in skirts.

Had Texas done it, Stanford, Alabama, or Penn State,
someone would have hee-hawed. But nary a laugh or peer
or smirk greeted these bonnie lads, only a big noise. It
was Notre Dame again, and they brought their band.

These musicians fapcy- danced around and then hit a
chord which. raised goose bumps big enough to harvest.
It was the Irish fight song, and everyone knew it.

WHO WOULD EVER think that sedate nuns would
clap and cheer to such rabble-rousing. Guys were taking
bets that 50 priests were going to toss their berets into the
air. Somewhere in the stands there was a Leahy and a
Sweeney who cheered. And an O’Malley and a Kelly and
an O’Leary no doubt joined in. But most amazing of all
Was that Speigels and Steins clapped, too. ‘Students who

hadn't gone to a football game in two. years were there. A
Trains and busesferried people in from Chicago, Detroit -.

and New York who donned their Irish green, stocked up
on shamrocks and headed for Oakland. ~

For the very mention of Notre Dame may denote a
school, but it somehow connotes a legend of the Four
Horsemen, Knute Rockne, and a splinter of the original
cross fused into one.

Dramatic Reading

 
 

 

, Zul<ofsky’s Poetry
Three University students will present a ‘dramatic reading from
the poetry of Louis Zukofsky Wednesday at 4 p.m. in the University

Book Center’s Fine Books Room.

The students, David Federman, Ron Caplan, and Rick Kline, are
seniors associated with Mother Press, which published Zukofsky’s
latest collection of short poems, After I’ .

Zukofsky is an  poet whom Federman ranks as “the
most prestigious among modern poets who have come up since World

( War II.” A “personal” poet considered an avante-garde in the ’30’s,
i Zukofsky was given the guest editorship of the magazine Poetry for

the “objectivist” issue in 1931.
Federman regards Ezra Pound «as
Zukofsky’s mentor.

Wednesday’s reading, according
to Federman, will be something
like Under Milkwood by Dylan

. Thomas.” The opening mood is
one of dejection. Sections of
Zukofsky’s major poem “A,” on
which he has been working for
30 years, will be read.

“Part of it was written on the
fall of Paris in 1940,” Federman
explained, “and it starts out al-
most like a news broadcast.” It
conveys the- sense of how words

2“ have lost their meaning, reveal-

ing the poet’s own dilemma.”

WPDU Beats
Vermont, 1 1-7

Varsity debaters Alan Kaufman
‘x and Mike Smith have defeated
the University of Vermont in the
William _Pitt Debating Union’s
third public series of the season.
Debating in the Boston area,
Kaufman and Smith won 11 bal-
lots, compared to Vermont’s sev-
en, in a series of six debates.
The topic was “Resolved: That
the federal government should
establish a’-i‘-national program of
public work for the unemployed."
A ‘total audience of 6,100 stu-

dents attended the series, part of

which was broadcast on closed
circut television. The series in
Boston was WPDU’s ﬁrst in that
area. .

3\ The Union’s victory over Ver-
mont pushes its record in public
debate series to 2-1. WPDU has
remaining debates with Augus-
tana, Wake Forest, Georgetown,
and ‘William and Mary.

Student Suicides
Rise According
To NEA Report

(Collegiate Press Service)

The National Education Jour-
nal (NEA) reports in its Novem-
ber issue that the number of stu-
dent suicides has risen alarm-
ingly during the past few years.

“Depressed boys and girls, Vic-
tims of inner turmoil and in-
creasingly difficult outside con-
ditions, are taking this way out
of their troubles,” Marguerite
Clark of the Cornell University
Medical College declared. In 1962,
the article continues, about 550
young people between * the ages
of 15_and 19 took their own lives.

Dr. Leif Braaten, former psy-
chologist of Cornell and author
of their study of this subject,
outlined four motives for student

suicides in 'his report: a desire»

to destroy oneself because of be-
ing unable to tolerate any longer
the discrepancy between how one
appears and how he would like
to appear; a need to punish

others; an urge to repent-from.‘

‘some sin‘; and a cry for help. g

Surprisingly, the Cornell doc-.
tors found that the student-pa-

tient who gets the highest marks"

is the one most likely to commit
suicide. '

“The bright students were of-
ten oveneachjng "themselves,
measuring themselves by their
own standards, which were much
higher and more demanding than
the minimum standards of the
University,” the report concluded.

Toastmaster International
at Established on Campus

.A branch of Toastmasters International, a world-wide
men’s educational organization, has recently been estab-
lished at the University. The Toastmasters, with 3700

chapters in 50 countries, stress

the achievement of better’ public

_ speaking, listening and critical
“‘ thinking.

Lt. Col. William Tinsley, pro-
fessor of  science, has been
elected temporary president and
student Howard Berkowitz, tem-
porary vice-president. S. N. Shah,
a part-time student from India,
is secretary-treasurer, and Dr.
James Beroes, associate professor

‘ of chemical engineering, is chair-
man of the special committee for
constitution and by-laws.

The meeting format consists of
each member presenting a speech
not to exceed two minutes. Be-
fore speaking, each is given a
slip of paper with a topic on it
and has one minute to prepare
a delivery. Following these pre-
liminary-speeches, three or four
speeches, each about six minutes
long, are presented. All speeches
are evaluated.

The group will meet again on
Nov. 25. Membership is open to

IT STILL HURTS TO LOSE .

NOTRE DAME football players hung their heads after

the football game Saturday. They Won. The Panthers
carried John Michelosen off‘ the field. They lost.

Yes, the Panthers played a good game They
have a right to be proud about the way they played.
But they lost. There is something pathetic about a
team almost winning a game, and then being happy
about coming close. That’s something like a dead
man being happy because a bullet almost missed his
heart.

How can a football player, after losing a game
as close as the Notre Dame game, say, “That game
was a moral victory, and don’t let anyone tell you
different? How can a football team be satisfied with
a two poi‘nt loss?

IT’S THE FIRST time we ever jubilation over a team

I that beat the spot but lost the game. What has happened

to football here that the team and the fans can be
satisfied with losing? There should have been tears"
in the locker room after the game, not smiles.

A competitive team should be playing a competi-
tive game. When they play, they should play to win,
and should not be satisfied with losing. Beating the
spot when you’re an underdog gets you nothing more
than a loss. When all the excitement dies down, the
Notre Dame game is, after all, just another loss.

Sure, there’s something admirable about being a
good loser. They say it’s something about “It counts
not thatyou won or lost, but how you played the
game.” But ratings depend on whether you {Win or
lose. Bowl committees count whether you Win or lose.
And yes, even the alumni care whether you win or
lose. And they buy tickets.

‘~ AND THERE should have been no jo.y here because Pitt

almost beat Notre Dame, even though the Panthers played
their best game of the season. That just makes it
more frustrating.
IE THE PANTHERS stop Carl Stichweh at_ Michie Sta-
d1'um on Saturday, they will defeat the Cadets.
In addition, the Panthers’ ground game against
the Cadets should be even better than it was against
N otre Dame. The Panthers should move well through
their own right side—well enough to Win, 21-15.

Soccer Team Plays at Bucknell

Panthers Ready for Army

The Panthers and the ca-

Michie Stadium in West

ern teams are trying to sal-

vage Winning seasons. The
Panthers show a 2-4-2 record
While Army has a 2-6 record.

Panther Coach Walt Cummins,
who scouted the game between

says that the Army record is not
indicative of What they can do.

“They have been playing in
bad luck all season,” said Cum-
mins. “Against the Texas team
they had two touchdowns called
back and lost by a ﬁeld ghal.
They also had a touchdown call-
ed back in the Boston College
game and lost.”

‘‘We can’t take them lightly be-
cause Stichweh is so great. He
can do anything a great quarter-

good as running as he is at pass-
ing and he has experience,” ex-
plained Cummins.

Army isn’t all Stichweh, how-
ever, and the Panther coach em-
phasized the point. “They have
an extremely big team for an
Army squad. That end Champi is
six-foot-four and weighs around
225. Their line is also big.”

Sam Champi is the Cadets split
end and is Stichweh’s favorite
receiver. He led Army in pass
receiving last; year by catching
13 tosses for 146 yardsland one
touchdown.

Stichweh sparks Army's of.
fense. He is the option type quar-
terback who rlms more often than

unleash their frustration on Buck-
nell. “We have better skills than
them,” said Bemis, “but they 31.

tion.” 7 -~

them in the second half. The‘
game was a lot closer than the
27-15 score indicates.”

If one tries to compare Pitt
and Army, they have a lot in
common when it comes to mis-
takes, “They have been in most of
the ball games they have played
but have made costly mistakes,”
explained Cummins. “They fum-g A
ble, have a pass intercepted, or ".
have a penalty called against
them in key situations.”

World record for rim — stop
talking was set by Kevin Shee-
han, Ireland, with 133 hours. The
feminine non-stop talking record
was set by Mrs. Alton Clapp, ,,
North Carolina, with 96 hours,
54 minutes and 11 seconds.

he thows. He can be compared to
Fred Mazurek by the style of his
quarterbacking. Stichweh, also
like Mazurek, has been hampered
by injuries;

“Stichweh played a ﬁne game
last week as did the whole team,”
said Cummins. “Syracuse got a
quick lead, and Army caught‘ up
at the end of the ﬁrst half, but
Syracuse was too powerful for

1962 team which had a 7-1-2,
and played in the NCAA play-
offs. The booters, however, have
a 4-4 record this year and no
chance of gaining an NCAA

Bucknell has a poor team with
a 1-8 record and being outscored

Bob Longo

Part of Job

By TOM SACKS
For Bob Longo, playing
end for the freshman team

‘ "‘hasn’t been the center of

glory and isolation it was in high
school.

At Baldwin High School the
split-end’s job was to catch pass-
es on his own terms. His coach-
es never expected Longo to block,

_ ‘yet, in three short games this

’year he realized that it was a
sorely missing skill.

“I’m a poor blocker,” said the
six-foot-four, 210 pound Longo. I
might have thrown three blocks
at the most in high school. Here
it's a big change. I have to block
and I’m trying to learn.”

“He’s got all the moves,” said

 coach Bill Kaliden. “He has very
deceiving speed and is the size a
quarterback likes to throw to, but
he'll have to learn“ to block.”

In the Cubs’ three games, Lon-
go caught 11 passes for 148 yards
and two touchdowns.

As an all-America for Baldwin,

.9I\1he caught 50 passes for nine

touchdowns last year. He also
lettered in basketball for two
years.

Before choosing Pitt, Longo
sifted through 85 other offers
among which were Notre Dame,
Illinois, Syracuse and Navy. “I
jumped at the chance to come
here. There's something about

sudden you’re a Pitt Panther and
just that means a lot.

“In junior high I played quar-
terback, but I switched to end
the next year. I just wanted to
catch instead of throw. In high
Where I’d be running and that’s

 ).school I told the quarterback

where he threw. Playing to pat-
terns is a big change."

The choice of a college career
in football over basketball w.asn’t
such a hard one for Longo to

make. “Ever since I can remem-I

ber I’ve liked playing football.
When I was real young, I hadpan
idol who was four years older
than me. He was always playing
football and I tagged along in-
Stead of playing cowboys and
Indians.” '

   

The cross-country team will
meet some of the top long-dis-
tance runners in the country in
the IC4A’s on Monday. The har-
riers will hold _a light workout
Sunday afternoon to ‘acquaint
themselves with the Van Cortland
park course.

Coach Jim Banner said that all
of his runners are in good physi-
cal shape. That means that John
Bailey, Damien Koch, Dave Eich-
enlaub, Ralph Basinski, Fran
Shor, Don Hinchberger, and
Frank Handleman will be un-

 

 

hampered by the various injuries
that have plagued them through
the season.

Banner has sought this past
week to improve the sprint cap-
abilities of each of the harriers.
Due to the layout of the Bronx
course, the coach considers it im-
perative that all of his runners
get out of the huge pack of near-
1y 200- starters if any of them
have the slightest ‘éhance of win-
ing.

The opening straightaway lasts

for about 1,000 yards and then

the hills and forest trails demand
running power rather than speed.
Any harrier left in the rear of
the pack as the runners approach
the rough terrain cannot be in
contention, according to Banner.

He ﬁgures that if any of the
Panthers can stay in or close to
have a good chance of placing
the lead for the ﬁrst mile, they
high in the race. As-to who might
have the best chance, Barmer
noted that every week a differ-
ent man has come through for
the harriers and it would be dif-

Outlook Dim

For Matmen

Wrestling practice began last
week, and the season outlook is
dim. “We’re short-handed in the
heavier weights,” said coach Rex
Peery, “and we don’t have much
depth on the squad.”

Captain Mike Johnson, Frank
0’Korn, Tom Baily, Dino Boni,
Tom Heniff, Lee Hall, and Bill
Beck .are the only returning let-
termen, and Baily, O’Korn, and
Boni are now at about the same
weight.

Peery was confronted with a
similar shortage of wrestlers Last
year, but salvaged a 7-2. record,
and second place in the East.
“They surprised me last year,”
Peery said, “and I hope they do
it again this year.”

The world’s record for sit-ups
is 14,000 set several weeks ago by

an FBI agent.
