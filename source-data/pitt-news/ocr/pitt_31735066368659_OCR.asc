Book Store Director
Testifies At Hearing

By MARK A SINDLERH

Pitt book center director Mary

Bonach gave theikey testimony dur- .

ing the Pennsylvania Labor Rela-
tions Board hearing last week in the
suit brought by several Pitt Book
Center employees and the Allegheny
Joint Regional Board (AJ RB).
Bonach testified about the events
that led to the ultimate decision of
whether or not the employees were

disciplined fairly for their union-

organizing initiatives.

When the original hearing on
May 9 was adjourned early because
university attorneys had subsequent
commitments, three additional
hours of litigation followed on May
[2 in the State Office- Building,
downtown.

Bonach testified that she had
indeed received notification by mail
that early attempts; were being estab-
lished to form a union within the
bookstore. It is a matter ofdebate as
to whether it was her responsibility
to forward this information to those
supervisors directly accountable to
her.

AJ RB representative Dan Coff-
man said he believes that Bonach
acted irresponsibly by forwarding
the letter to an employees relations
division in the university instead of
to the supervisors.

Coffman and another AJRB
representative, Tom Scheid, are
handling the case of former book-
store employees Charles Delaney
and Tim Brady after they were fired
early in January for what they
believed were their efforts to organ-
ize a union. 1

Three other employees were sus-
pended one day each at the begin-

ning of the year for whatthey said '

were similar attempts to become for-

 

\

mally associated with Local lOl of '

the Retail Wholesale Department

4 Store Union.

“Generally, when you have an
organizing campaign, it spreads like
wildfire through management, and
everybody talks about it,” Coffman
explained. “What Bonach wants us
to believe is that it really didn’t mean
anything to her and that shejust sent
a copy to director of personnel. She’

Pitt Decides To Terminate Jointchemistry Program 

 By PEGGY ream J.

Pitt has withdrawn from a joint
forensic chemistry program with
Allegheny County because of salary
disputes among instructors, accord-
ing to W. Richard Howe, assistant .
chairman of Pitt’s chemistry
department. ’

i The program, which draws upon
the country’s crime lab for much of
its part-time faculty, has been faced
with the problem of faculty depar-
tures. Four of the 18 part-time
faculty have left in the last 18

“MasterCard lnternational~—so
worldly, so welcome," is a jingle
you've probably heard over and
over, but if you're a college student,
there's a good chance you may not
be worldly or welcome.

College graduates, and even
undergraduates, usually start to
think about ‘ establishing credit in
their names before they get into the
job market. Although it may seem to
be a simple matter of filling out an
application, getting your first credit
card and establishing a line of credit
before graduation may not be that
easy.

Advertisements for credit cards
give the illusion that credit can be
purchased like any other product,
but there’s many qualifications that

must be met before a card can actu-.

months, Howe said, and it appears
more will be leaving.

“It is a problem," he said. “The
program is a joint effort between the
crime lab and Pitt, and we have no
authority to demand salary adjust-
ments for employees of Allegheny
County."

Howe said a study of salaries had
been presented to Dr. Charles L.
Winek, director of the county's
Department of Laboratories, that
“demonstrated salary problems."

The program, founded in 1969, is
a one-year structured program of 30

credits which emphasized course.

ally be obtained.

Companies have different ways of
awarding credit. Credit lenders look
at various aspects of your financial

situation, but one thing that’s
important to all of them is
employment’.

A graduating senior gets special
credit treatment as a potential
money maker, but even this is done
within a strict set of guidelines. lf a
graduating senior claims to have a
job lined up, the bank will check to
see that the job has been offered and
accepted. '

According to Barbara Wallace, a
Mellon Bank spokesman who deals
with Visa and Mastercard accounts,
any graduating senior or any college
student can apply for credit, but
after applying, his financial creden-
tials will be reviewed. The bank or
credit company will look at the fol-

work. Pitt's program, Howe
explained, is the only one in the
nation that offers its graduate stu-
dents internships as an integral part
of their educational experience. The
students receive a master‘s degree in
chemistry, and this, he said, will not

. be terminated.

Winek said in a May 9 Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette article that the coun-
ty's criminologists earn starting-
level salaries of about $14,500 and
are among the lowest paid in the
nation. Winek was unavailable for
comment.

Howe said the study was taken

lowing things:

0 lncome to date of application
(how much earned last year);

0 Income currently being earned
(a part-time job will earn a credit
card with a low credit line).

A graduating senior or other stu-
dent would fall under the special
programs heading and is evaluated
on the 222 rule. This rule uses three
special categories to classify people
applying for credit. The credit rating
is determined mostly by the financial
stability of the applicant.

The credit applicant must have
two years with the same employer,
two years at the same address and
two years with another credit
reference.

Wallace said that it’s important to
establish .a line of credit because

into consideration by the county,
but that due to union regulations,
salary adjustments were not
possible.

“They are similar except for one
difference,” Howe explained. “The
others offer a more academic
approach without internships.”

The impact of the program-termi-
nation on Pitt after the last class
graduates in August will be negligi-
ble, according to Howe.

“There will be no disruption of
activities," he said. “We only lose the
opportunity to provide students
with a unique experience.”

Pitt's decision to withdraw from
the program was delivered in a letter
to Winek on April 28, but Howe said
he has yet to receive a reply.

Howe also sent an inventory of
Pitt's equipment (on loan to the
crime lab) to Winek on Sept. 24.
Included are microscopes and other
items to be returned upon the com-
pletion of the program.

Prospective students interested in
the program are being referred to
other similar ones in the East, specif-
ically at George Washington Uni-

versity and North Eastern
University. .

Come September, students
will find that the brunt of some
favorite campus jokes will no
longer be around.

Burger Chef, located on the
ground floor of the Cathedral of
Learning, is being replaced by a
Roy Rogers fra‘nchise——
Oakland’s second one. The
Burger Chef area will close on
May 28 for renovation and
reopen in mid-August, according
to a memo written by Donovan
Hughes, the director of housing
and food services.

In the memo, Hughes said a
committee comprised of student
leaders and Pitt staff met during
the winter term to look into the
food services area in the Cathe-
dral. Hughes said the committee
was asked by- Vice-Chancellor
for Business and Finance Joseph
Dutton to evaluatethe area and

investigate possible alternatives.

After hearing proposals from
various fast food chains, the
committee recommended that an
agreement be offered to a Pap-
Rogers
franchise, the memo said.

Both Dutton and Hughes were
unavailable for comment on the
committee’s decision.

Future plans for the area are
up in the air until franchise
owners and university officials
can meet later this week to dis-
cuss the change.

Bob Robinson of the Housing
and Food Services Office said
the vending facilities on the
ground floor will still be availa-
ble for students, faculty and
staff.

Burger Chef has been on the
ground floor for approximately
eight years.

She went on to say that Mellon
Bank, through it’s work with Visa
and Mastercard, “wants students
and also wants to establish a rela-
tionship that will be beneficial to
both students and the bank.”

_ She said that each applicant is

Credit cards for some smaller
companies, such as department
stores, are obtained more easily, but
similar qualifications as those for
major cards apply here as well.

The .l.C. Penney Co. Inc. awards
credit cards on a point-scoring sys-
tem. Length of stay at an address
and so forth are worked into a basic
quotient, and if the number is high
enough, credit is awarded.

“Some kind of verifiable income,
not always family income, is what’s
most important,”a Penney’s spokes-
man commented.

One factor which is an obstacle to
credit acquisition, according to the
spokesman, is outstanding student
loans. Bad financial dealings such as
bouncing a number of checks is con-

Spokesmen for the credit com-
panies did comment, however, that
students are given considerations
such as change of address and lack
of financial dealings.

A company notorious for extend-
ing credit to students is the Sears,

Sears awards its charge plates on
its own system of evaluation, and

didn't bother to tell her assistant."
Bonach’s assistant, Peter Sol-
lento, earlier testified during the
May 9 hearing that he, in fact, had
no knowledge of union-organizing
attempts by the bookstore
employees when he handed Delaney
and Brady their termination papers.

Coffman said he does not believe
that Bonach was the only bookstore
administrator to know of union-
organizing attempts.

Coffman said that Bonach’s for-
warding the union letter without
informing her supervisors “wasn’t a
responsible business decision. That’s
not the way companies are told to.do
things when they know that l.ll'll0I'l
activity is going on.”

He said the first thing attorneys
and other business people do is call
their supervisors and explain the
laws of such activities. Coffman said
that according to her testimony,
Bonach ignored that advice.

body in a responsible position like
that wouldn’t at least let the supervi-

sors know that there is union activity
going on,” Coffman said.

University counsel Ron Talarico
acknowledges that Bonach was fully

'..

within her duties to forward the My

union information she received to
the employee, relations division in
the university.

“Union activities on this campus
would‘ be handled at a much higher
level than any of the supervisors who
report to Mary,”‘Talarico said. “At
that stage of the game, if there were
organizing activities going on, it
would be handled by employee rela-
tions or above.” -

Talarico referred to union-
organizing efforts in past years at
Pitt and added that Bonach’s actions
in this matter were par for the
course.

“What's happened in the last sev-
eral years, we've had several
attempts to organize on this campus
and each time it was decided that the
only appropriate unit would be all
clerical people on the campus,” he
said. “So when Mrs. Bonach gets a
piece "of paper in the mail saying that
the ‘XYZ Union’ wants to organize
just the bookstore employees orjust
the shipping department employees
of the bookstore, from the expe-
rience she's had in the past, it did not
mean anything significant to her.”

There was actually nothing for
Bonach to discuss with Sollento or
anybody in a similar capacity as
Talarico with regard to preliminary
union information, Talarico said.

Once a union would be estab-
lished, all supervisors would be
given in-service training with exem-
plary attention paid to such matters
as what a contract means, he said.

Both the university and AJRB
representatives must now await the
return of transcript copies that con-
tain testimony from the two
hearings.

After those are in both parties’
hands, in about 10 days, they will
then have approximately two weeks
to file briefs, which will subse-
quently be submitted to the hearing
examiner who heard the litigation.

His decision with regard to the
status of Delaney and Brady will
then be rendered. '

By JOHN HOUSTON

Academic tenure is deﬁned by Pitt
as a status accorded members of the
university who have demonstrated
high ability and achievement in their
dedication to the growth of human
knowledge.

Under Pitt's tenure policy, tenure is
only granted to the most qualiﬁed of

. teachers. Under the policy’s guide-

lines, a teacher who wishes to obtain
tenure is put into what is called the
tenure stream. Once in the tenure
stream, he has seven years to meet
the requirements put forth by the
university.

Those requirements state that a
teacher must be a good teacher,
must obtain a doctorate and must be
published frequently.

Once these requirements have
been met, the candidate must go
before the tenured professors in the

department. If he receives enough 

votes in his favor, then his recom-
mendation goes to the chancelor for
ﬁnal approval.

Many teachers within the univer-
sity have complained that this policy
is unfair. This week's Forum deals
with the fairness of Pitt's tenure

policy.

Jerome Rosenberg,
FAS Dean

Jerome Rosenberg, dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said

.that of all faculty members, 50 to 60

percent of them are tenured.

Over the last decade, the quality of
tenured faculty at Pitt has greatly
increased, and today it is difﬁcult to
get tenure.

- Rosenberg said he sees the reason
for this is the fact that when Pitt puts
someone on tenure, the school has
to ﬁgure on an outlay of about $1
million over the length of the individ-
uals employment.

Rosenberg added that while Pitt
had put a number of less qualiﬁed
people on tenure in the past, he said
those instances today are few.

Those teachers at Pitt today who
do not have tenure are very con-

Forum:

cerned about both their chances of
getting it.

Alice Scales,
University Senate
Committee

Alice Scales, a member of the Uni-
versity Senate Committee on Tenure
and Academic Freedom, said the
official stand of the committee is that
the tenure policy is generally fair.

In some cases, the committee has
believed that a questionof tenure for
a professor was handled unfairly and
‘on a number of occasions, the com-
mittee has been able to get the judge-
ment overturned.

Scales said any changes that have
to occur must do so at the depart-
mental level and restated that the
guidelines set forth by the university

’ are fair.

While the question is at the univer-
sity level, the deans have much con-
trol over who gets tenure in their
respective schools, she said.

Scales also said that the senate
committee on tenure has been

those reasons, she said she should

ForThe
Common
Wealth

Americans have been ashamed of alcohol for a
long time.

That shame first led us to a constitutional pro-
hibition of spirits. Later, finding it still more
degrading to have a drink illegally, a depressed
American lifted the ban, but never shook its inhi-
bitions about liquor. .
V Now our moral snobbery is enshrined in a
bizzare ritual performed every election day-a
day made famous by Americans for mass displays
of bizzare behavior. Y esterday—as on each elec-
tion day——the bars and liquor stores were closed.

Tomorrow’s historians will no doubt wonder
why an entire society would so regularly disre-
gard the dictates of common sense. Why do we
turn every barroom burn and cocktail lounge
lizard into the streets on the day we choose our
leaders? Why do we deny the honest citizen a
drink before-or after-he must knowingly choose
some clown or otherto run his government?

Of course thereis a serious answer. The people
should be sober on voting day. (Shouldn’t they?)

On the other hand, Pittsburghers familiar with
their city and county officials probably find’vot-
ing to be sobering enough as it is.

Yesterday’s voting was a case in point. Despite
good weather and the combined appeal of more
than 2,000 candidates for several hundred posi-
tions around Allegheny County, voter turnout
was described as “light” by early Tuesday
evening.

It seems that county voters were not overly
excited by the chance to re-elect as county com-
missioners two ‘former coroners whose shady
bookkeeping cost the county hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars.

Perhaps a few belts of Old Red Eye would have
made the voter’s job easier.

Clearly, then, the reason for closing the pubs V
on election day must be that we are ashamed of
drinking—-in fact, more ashamed of drinking
than of the choices we must make concerning our
rulers.

Frankly, looking at the field of candidates who
vied for our favor yesterday, .that’s surprising.

Q: May an employer discriminate

Dear Editor:

In regards to the letter, “Join The
Crew“ (April 6) which suggested a
crew team at Pitt, I feel as though
Pitt needs students to join the crew.

Pitt needs to open up more activi-
ties to the students. People who are
not very» good in other sports can
join the crew-—they only have to
move their arms with the boat. Pitt
can establish a championship squad
in that field!

Students will have an opportunity

A: No, according to the 1978 Preg-

women who are able to work must

and those women who are disabled
by pregnancy, childbirth or other
related medical conditions must be
treated like other disabled workers.

application? 0

A: The answer depends on the indi-
vidual circumstances. If a woman
applies for an individual account in
her own name and has enough
income or property of her own to
qualify for the amount of credit
requested, the creditor may not
require her husband’s signature.

The Rights Of Women

However, if a married couple app-"I
lies for a joint account or if the
woman can only rely upon jointly
owned property as collateral, the
husband’s signature will be
required.

Q: In the event of a divorce, what
right does a woman have to pro-
perty acquired during marriage?

A: In states such as Pennsylvania,
property ownership is determined
on a “common law” basis rather
than being seen as community prop-
erty to be evenly distributed
between the husband a and wife.
Common law generally implies that
the person whose name the property
is in owns it and paid for it. If two
names were used, it should be
divided.

Q: Can any school organization
discriminate?

A: Yes, although .most organiza-
tions are forbidden to discriminate
on the basis of sex. An amendment
added to Title IX of the Education
Act says that organizations such as
college fraternities and sororities,
the YMCA and YWCA and Boy
Scouts and Girl Scouts may legally
discriminate if comparable activities
are available for members of the
opposite sex.

Q: Do female college students have
the right to equal treatment in cam-
pus living rules?

A: Yes, Title IV ofthe I982 Federal
Education Act explicitly prohibits
colleges from applying different
housing rules and regulations to
men and women. charging them dif-
ferent fees or offering them different
benefits or services. On campus
residency requirements, curfews or
parietal rules applied to men or
women only are also illegal.

U2 Battles on \‘A

UZIROBERT ELLIS ORRALL
May 6, 1933
Fulton Theatre

By FRANK DICIIACOMO

What an idea-—inaugurate the Ful-
ton Theatre as a concert hall with a
show that will probably end up as the
year's best concert. The concept was

not a simple one, but U2 turned the-

ory into’ fact with a performace that
reaffirmed the faith of many a dis-
heartened rock-n-roller. I

This has been the band's finest
year. With the release of War, U2
have finally found the right flagpole
for their music and their message and
the band as a single entity has become
as sharp as The Edge always was. The
Fulton concertwas simplyanother
facet to U2-—it showed that live, this
band has even more conviction than
their recorded material even hints at.

Opening» the show was Bostonian
Robert Ellis Orall who, despite being

more towards dance mix than R 8: B,
there is still that fat sound present
that he has termed ”big band rock-n-
roll." ‘

”Modern Love,” the album's first
cut and far and away the best song on
the album, is the most evocative of
the presiding style of Let's Dance. The
tune starts out with an irresistibly
funky guitar riff that slides into some
heavy Gene Krupa drumming. Bowie
talks through a few lines and then
leaps into his voice for the '80s. Piano
and horns complete the picture and
everyone is dancing back into the mid
'70s. I

There are four more songs like this
on Let's Dance, including a beefed ver-
sion of the title cut that is different
from the one being overplayed on the
radio. The remaining four cuts are
just as likeable as the others, and the
album is magnetic by its second spin.

Still, there is something a little too

quite different musically from U2,
managed to win the favor of this
crowd. Orrall’s strong voice and
unpretentiousness gave him the
advantage, and though some of his
songs sound alike, he managed to be
quite entertaining. The best of his set
included ”Fade and Repeat," ”White
Noise" and ”Tell Me If It Hurts.” The

-heavy keyboard sound of Orrall’s

music helped mask his lousy guitarist
while his drummer and bassist pro-
vided an excellent rhythm section.
From the beginning, U2 did not
hold back. The band opened on auto-
matic clip with ”Gloria,” ”I Threw A
Brick Through A Window” and ”A
Day Without Me”—songs that most
bands would save for their encores.

buzz saw guitar sound seemed to
move the music even faster.

The stage and most of the band
members were dressed in black,
which added to the starkness of the
scenario. Through the entire show,
guitarist The Edge, singer Bono Vox
and bassist Adam Clayton remained
as a trio moving to the lip of the stage,
backing up and moving forward
again. Their actions seemed to sug-

gest some sort of neo—reincarnation

of ”The Spirit Of ’76” fife and drum
corp with Bono’s drum major high-
stepping and Clayton's and The
Edge’s instrument brandishing.
Drummer Larry Mullen remained off
to the side and seemed disconnected
from the whole affair, though his
drumming didn't.

piece. His sad, childlike eyes look
directly into the audience and not

‘September 30, 1955'; a two-car
smash up on a lonely highway
claimed the life of James Dean. His

brief career had inspired a genera-

tion, and he has_since become some-
thing immortal. The legend rests on

a three movies-—East of Eden, Rebel With-

out a Cause, and Giant; he was mystery,
brooding cool and undefinable. He
was—James ‘Dean. The myth hangs
like a tantalizing gauze curtain over
director Robert Altman's latest film,
Come Back to the Five and Dimejimmy
‘Dean, Jimmy Dean.

Small-town dime stores do not
change; today is ’’the same as it was
yesterday and the day before,” and

entirely in a Texas Woolworths,

banging screen doors, tables heaped.

with items, permanent ”sale” signs, a
neon jukebox, and a soda fountain
with a continually churning orange
drink dispenser. ’

A string of letters suspended from
the ceiling announces ”September 30,
1955-September 30, 1975" as part of
the decore for the twentieth reunion
of The Disciples of James Dean—an
exclusive club in its day and now a
hopeful memory dedicated to
upkeeping the myth.

The past is related via flashback.
Mona (Sandy Dennis) was working at
the five and dime in 1955, entertain-
ing a Photoplay romance with James
Dean and serving as president of the

' Disciples, who met regularly and rev-

erently, attired in red Rebel jackets.

  Altman Sells 5 and Dime Mythology

Dean's new movie, Giant was to be
filmed in nearby Maﬁa, Texas, and
local extras were needed. Mona and
Joe, the only male Disciple, traveled

‘to the site. Chosen to be part of

Giant's crowd, Mona had her once-in-
a-lifetime. .. e
Twenty years later, and one by
one, the most fervant members of the
Disciples arrive at the five and dime
to honor their idol—Stella Mae
(Kathy Bates), brassy andmarried for
money to a Texas oilman; Edna
Louise (Marta I-leflin), a quiet house-
wife and expecting her seventh child;
and Cissy (Cher), local good-time—gal

‘with twenty-year-old dreams of a

better future. Of course, Mona is
present, and Juanita (Sudie Bond),
proprietor of the store, den—mothers
gathering, curing all ills with Jesus
radio and-Orange Crush.

The reunion is generally robust as
memories are spilled, overlapping
and blending into a shrill mixture
until a stranger drops by—a beautiful
woman who looks familiar and seems
to know the surroundings.

Ed Graczyk’s script, closely adapted
from his stage play, becomes rather
contrived at this point, and leads,
unfortunately, to a weak conclusion.

Five and Dime works overall, though, -

because of the beautiful exposition
and characterizations. The dime

faultless ~throughout—highlight the

Kathy Bates accurately catches the
mouthy but insecure Stella Mae, and
Marta Heflin is equally effective as
the mousy, amenable Edna. Karen
Black comes across as slightly uneasy
in a pivotal role, but Cher’s Cissy is
remarkable and surprising, full of ”I
know what boys like” and bravado-
colorful and moving.

Robert Altman has taken some

chances, which isn't unusual for him.

Jimmy Dean is confined to the,dime
store (like a stage setting), with only
glimpses of the hazy world outside
the screen door; the claustrophobic
feeling reinforces the stagnant heat
and dustiness of Texas. The transi-
tions‘ are expertly done—flashbacks
are led into through the long mirror

behind the soda fountain, a surreal \

Wonderland reflection of the past.
The characters are costumed the
same and do not appear noticeably
younger during these scenes, hinting
that all has remained exactly the
same, including James Dean. "We
won't let him die,” one of the girls
says when they hear over the radio of

his death. -A

BEYOND THE COLD WAR: A NEW
APPROACH TO THE ARMS RACE
AND NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION

E.P. Thompson

Pantheon Books"

People have finally begun to realize
that there are questions concerning
the survival of our species. They have
had enough of living this nation's
gone glory vicariously through old
John Wayne movies——and the abun-
dance of "no-nuke" literature reflects
this.

But this is the age for a new cavalry
to come pouring over those hills.
Those concerned with the Cold War

‘have a very different battle to fight, ‘

and writer—historian E.P. Thompson

' is telling them to fall in line before it's

too late.

His book, Beyond the Cold War: A New
Approach to the Arms Race and Nuclear
Annihilation is exactly that—a new
approach that takes the reader
beyond the usual graphic and pitiful
descriptions of destruction past or
future to the realm of possible
solutions.

Thompson, well known for his
work with the European peace move-
ment, sees the F.nrnc’p}~+rir disarma-

. ‘ideological barriers between East and

~ pristine purity, only by a handful of

ment movement as a historical
phenomenon and one that “has the
opportunities to break down the

West. Europe has the responsibility,
according to Thompson, to keep com-
munications between the Superpow-
ers .open, but not to mistakenly
regard itself as the leader.

Peace rests on internationalism.

Unlike other, more serious facts
and figures books that cloud the real
issue, Thompson's book is not dry.
He instead presents a witty and
sometimes satirical examination of
the insanity of the arms race.

He likes the theory of deterrence to
addiction. "Deterrence theory," he
writes, "is in truth a pitiful, light-
weight theory. It is espoused, in its

monkish celibates, retired within the
walls of centers of Strategic Studies.
It cannot endure intercourse with the
real world."

The fact that it is opinionated,
however, does not compromise the
book's accuracy. Thompson's
research (and his sincerity) can stand
on its own. '

PEGGY I-"ERRI

Biowiem

continued from page ﬁve
easy about this album. This is shallow

Bowie. This album, while it captures

the escapism attitude of the '80s dis-
mal foreshadowings, doesn't say too
much. "Ricochet," the album's only
really cerebral piece, seems a little too
weighty with its dark lyrics. There is
hope within the lines, but it is lost

’ within the fragmented arrangement. _

In addition, Bowie has put two
songs on this‘ album that do not
belong. One, a remake of "Cat Peo-
ple,” is intended to be ballsier than its
predecessor but fails to raise the flesh
like the original still does. The other,
"Criminal World," was not written by
Bowie, and its style interrupts the
continuity of l.et's Dance. Bowie has
too much to say to be doing this.

One good move made was to use
Nile Rodgers for production and new
musicians like Stevie Ray Vaughn,
Rodgers and Carmine Rojas instead
of the usual G.E. Smith and Tony
Visconti. This does give the album a
fresher sound, especially with
Vaughn’s guitar genius, and keeps
the musical end out of any rut that
might- occur from over-familiarity

. with Bowie’s work.

However, Let's Dance is too safe an
album for someone with the creativ-
ity of David Bowie. Sure, it's his first
album with EMI, but the contract was
supposed to give him free reign— not
a lax attitude. Ofcourse, this album is
worth buying, but artistically, it's a
let—down. After all, it's only natural
to expect more from the man who

brought us the future of rock—n-roll. .

FRANK DIGIACOMO

DANSEPARC
Martha and the Muffins
RCA

Their name tells a lot; Martha
Johnson and her three Muffins
approach their music with an unself-
conscious sense of fun. They're from
Canada and already have earned
some success at home and overseas.
Danseparc, their fourth album, is just
out, and Martha and company have
unleashed a batch of surprising stuff.
Let's try to classify it first. Danseparc is
a collection of neat, new, rhythmic
dance-type music with funk and jazz
influences. Sort of. But listen and
enjoy.‘

Martha's got a deliciously low
voice, and she handles most of the
lead vocals (as well as guitar and key-
boards). She has a good voice, not
especially strong, but entirely ade-
quate, and it seems to fit the Muffins’
music. The songs are mostly excel-
lent, with hook—y tunes, danceable
rhythms and some plain irreverent
musical effects. Johnson and Muffin
Mark Gane co-wrote most of the
album's material, and Gane assists on
vocals, guitar and keyboards. Nick
Kent on drums and Jocelyne Lanois
on bass fill things out, and all the
Muffins contribute various percus-
sive stylings.

Side 1 kicks off with the vaguely
romantic title cut. "Every day it's
tomorrow, and I never know what
tomorrow will be,” Martha muses in
”Danseparc." "Walking Into Walls"
features good saxophone work from
Ron Allen; ”just another urban
drama," sighs Martha, and there's
real soap opera dialogue undereath it
all, commentary on life in the '80s and
all that. "Several Styles of Blonde
Girls Dancing” could be as good as its
title; African pygmy chants and tribal
rhythms are worked into it, and Gane
handles the vocal. "Boys in the
Bushes” highlights side 2, irresistable
danceable with a squealing sax. "Tou—
rists...missing the forest for the
trees," explains the lyric—what are
the boys doing in there? ‘And ”What
People Do For Fun" explores some
unusual possibilities-—"she puts per-
fume everywhere, just in case"
before a date—and eruptsinto a jan-
gling cacophony and Talking Head-
sian funk.

There are nine songs on the LP,
and Danseparc offers a lot of imagina-
tive fun and variety. Tongue-in-
cheek lyrics adequately match the
musical surprises on the menu. Pass
the Muffins, please, and one of these
days, Martha and company will be
”discovered" in the U.S.A.

emerges a survivor—Si Kahn, a Har-

‘ vard graduate turned full-time acti-

vist and organizer, whose three
critically acclaimed albums of con-
temporary folk may not revive the
form single-handedly, but whose
impact has grown with each.

Kahn’s music follows in the tradi- _

tion of Pete Seeger and Woody Guth-
rie, providing an understated but
biting reflection on the everyday lives
of the people he knows best——the
miners of Applachia and the textile
mill workersof the Deep South.

"You can talk aboutdemocracy/Well Ijust
have to laugh/I know I'm gonna end my
days/Down in this old coal shaft/But you
know the company gets the coal/You know the
miner gets the shaft," Kahn sings in
"Black Gold," with a wit that's sharp
and unafraid to cut to the heart of the
matter.

Kahn employs a variety of sounds
and styles on Doing My Job, often con-
trasting the sprightly bluegrass
sounds of banjo and dobroagainst the
lyrical mood of despair. He's not
oblivious to the plight of the working
man elsewhere either; his "Detroit
December" succeeds in portraying

' urban bleakness in a fashion used by

the likes of Jim Carroll and Tom
Waits.
Fiddles, piano, horns and a host of

it can be enjoyed solely on that level.
But Kahn’s images and story telling,
used economically and with pricking
detail, defy the listener to_ look the
other way.

Kahn doesn't bother with the kind
of ideological whimsies that may ulti-
mately have killed off folk music as a
voice for the common man. Instead
he sings both about and to the people,

about half the size of the Stanley, this

For those who missed this show,
well, it's a real shame. There are not
many times when the chemistry
among the band, the hall and the
audience is as right as it was for this
concert. Which isn't to say it won't

By CHARLIE O‘HARA

The l3th Annual Pitt Track Invi-
tational, held this past Saturday at
Pitt Stadium, lived up to every bit of

billing.

' The feature race of the day, the
John Woodruff 800-Meter Run-
named in honor of the former Pitt
star and I936 Olympic Gold medal-
ist in the event—-was particularly
indicative of the caliber of competi-
tion and performance that was
unveiled before the small but fortu-
nate crowd on hand.

All seven of the contestants broke
the 1:50 mark, and Neil Carter
(Purdue), the winner in 1247.5, set
new meet and stadium records.

There were three Panthers in the
race, and each came away with a
personal best. Junior Todd Colas
was fourth in l:48.4, while seniors
Terry Gallagher and Darren Geary

lam sixth (l:49.l) and seventh

(l:49.5), respectively.
Another of the day’s more excit-
ing events was the l,600-meter relay.

For the Panthers, it was specifi-
cally a day to remember.

Coaches John Vasvary and Steve
Lewis, prior to the race, honored the
four graduating seniors with plaques
and blue Pitt uniform tops with their
names sewn on the backs.

The four seniors, Rick Asberry,
Geary, Gallagher and Mario Joyner,
were then to compete in the relay
with two of the finest teams on the
east coast, Ohio State and West Vir-
ginia.

Pitt placed second, getting nipped

‘tit the wire in a neck-and-neck. battle
that found Ohio State on top. More_

importantly, though, the type of
race run signified the departing
group of seniors.

Theseseniors will long be remem-
bered, whether it be for their statis-
tical achievements——the leaders on a
team that shattered 19 school
records in a single season—or for
their willingness to make the best of

Panthers Squish

’ By scorr DELLETT

The 1983 Pitt baseball season
ended the same way it began~—with a
downpour. \

Rain cancelled the second game of
a double-header between the Panth-
ers and Akron. In the first game,
Akron shut out Pitt 2-0, as both
teams collected only four hits. In
contrast, the Panthers rang up 21
runs and 29 hits in a double-header
sweep of Penn State last
Wednesday.

One of the more important things
determined at University Park was
the status of pitcher Aaron Krause.
Krause missed the entire 1982 cam-
paign due to a nerve, problem in his
right arm.

Despite tiring in the latter innings,
Krause managed his fifth complete
game of the season, along with his
fourth win of the season, in the role
of stopper of the staff—a role he
must continue to play in 1984 if the
Panthers are to have any chance of
improving their l5-ll mark.

Vasvary said. “They gave the team
leadership and made some great
things happen. I’m just very happy
that we had the opportunity to
honor them. It was a special day for
some special people.

“I-hope that we can make the
honoring of the seniors at this meet a

Way To

The arm injury, suffered during a
summer league game in 1981, wasn’t
the type to end Krause’s competitive
career, but nevertheless, the surgery
was necessary.

“My understanding was that it
wasn’t major surgery, but it was
something that needed to be cor-
rected,” Manager Bobby Lewis said.
“The nerve got out of place, and it
needed to be readjusted.”

Despite leading the staff in most
categories, Krause was not the same
pitcher he was in 198 I, when he com-

‘tradit'i'on."" "

Despite the fact that there was
another senior’ who played a role in
the molding of the ‘82-‘83 season but
didn’t compete extensively during
the track season, Vasvary would not
let him go unnoticed.

“There was another senior this
year who made some big contribu-
tions,” he said. “We can’t forget
John Hutchison. He worked very
hard and made the transition to the

new coaches an easy one. He’s a‘

leader in a different way, but he
deserves the recognition.”

Among the other noteworthy per-
formances by Panthers on Saturday:
Joyner won the 400-meter interme-
diate hurdles in 52.0’, Ralph Mitton

won the triple jump with a leap of I

46-4 3/4; Roger Kingdom captured
the ll0-meter high hurdles in 14.2;

Bob Buczkowksi was second in the '

shot put with a toss of 52-3; and the
Panther 400-meter relay team of
Brian Mitchell, ‘Kingdom, Asberry
and Joyner set a new school record,
40.9.

IC4A PREVIEW: This weekend,
11 of the Panthers will compete in
the prestigious lC4A (Intercolle-
giate Amateur Athletic Association
of America) championships, to be
held on the Villanova campus. The
meet represents the ﬁnal opportun-
ity to qualify for the NCAA ‘Cham-

pionship Meet, which will be held in

June.

On the track, Asberry will run the
I00-meter dash. Kingdom and Dar-
ryl Shepherd will compete in the
I10-meter high hurdles. Bill Moor-
head will run the 1,500 meters.

In the 800-meter run, Colas, Gal-
lagher, Geary and Garland Brown,
who has missed much of the season
due to stomach pains, are all sche-
duled to compete. In the 400-meter
intermediate hurdles, Joyner is
entered.

The Panthers also have two relay
t'eams competing-—the 400-meter
team of Mitchell, Kingdom, Asberry
and Rich Baderinwa and the 1,600-
meter team of Geary, Gallagher,
Joyner and Baderinwa.

In the field events, two Panthers
have qualified. Bob Buczkowski will
hurl the shot put, and Kingdom will
compete in the high jump.

Season   Finale

bined with Alan Lachowicz and
Larry Lamonde to form a pitching
staff which led Pitt to a 25-8
record—the best mark in Panther
baseball history.

“Aaron needed to work his arm

back,” Lewis said. “He didn’t have_

the velocity he had during his fresh-
man year although he had the
control.

“In the Penn State game, the
velocity he had was back. Although
he was tiring, he wanted to pitch a
complete game.”

Krause's performance was not the
only thing over which Lewis could
gloat. The Panther hitting attack
was at full force at Happy Valley.
First baseman Tony LaCava and
shortstop Paul Westwood hit tower-
ing home runs over the 405-mark in
center field.

“There were no real standouts,”
Lewis said. “All down the lineup
everyone was hitting well.”

Unfortunately, the bats fell silent
in the season finale on Saturday.

Viewpoint

It was just a year ago that the Pitt
football coaches were referring to
their Parade All America quarter-
back recruit Rich Bowen as the heir
apparent to the Dan Marino.

   

Now, one year later, Bowen has

‘wdecided to transfer and is consider-

ing both Youngstown State and
Eldinboro State.

“Throughout the entire season
and then through the off season and
at the beginning ofthe spring drills, I
had been assured a chance to get
some time at the quarterback spot."

Bowen said. “Basically, that's all

that.’I wanted, a fair shot.

“Having waited almost an entire
year, I decided it was time to ‘go
somewhere else. So, during spring
ball, after I had been shunned again.
I went to Coach Fazio and talked to
him about it. He handled it quite
well. He asked me a couple times to
reconsider and told me that he still
believed that I could make it at Pitt.

“But after he realized that I was
through reconsidering,“ Bowen
said, “he offered me his support. He
told me that he would call places and
talk to people if I needed him. In
fact, he has given several ofthe area
coaches very high recommendations
concerning my playing ability. He
has handledvhimself in a very classy

Why Didn’t Pitt Coaches Make

I

manner. He’s a good guy, but things
just didn‘t work out between myself

__and the Pitt system. I just wasn’t

enjoying myself both on the field
and in the classroom.”

At the start of the season. Bowen
was listed as a defensive back, and
many of the Panther fans couldn't
believe it. Here was the local favorite
being left out in the cold.

Now, he has set his sights on a new
opportunity-—playing time.

“At Edinboro, the quarterback is
supposedly going to be a senior this
coming season. meaning that after I
sit out a year I should have a good
shot at starting in ‘84," he said.

“At Youngstown State, there will
be a couple of QB‘s to contend with.

A Pass At Bowen?

but as long as I'm given a fair shot at
the beginning, I will be satisfied."

Why couldn't the illustrious Pitt
football program have given him
that? If he wasn’t good enough from
the start, why didn‘t they just tell
him that it is going to be a long time
before he gets a shot or even ask him
to consider leaving the program.

There were obviously reasons for
not doing either, and one of them
was probably that he was good
enough to stay. This makes the
whole ordeal even more preposter-
ous. Why can't a qualified athlete be
awarded the opportunity to contend
for a given spot? He obviously
wasn't that super as a defensive

'back; " '

Hopefully, much can be learned
by both the Panther coaching staff
and the high school recruits around
the country.

“I remember when they made
their recruiting visits, they were so
nice,__" Bowen said. “They laid it on
awfully heavy and made you feel like
a million bucks. When I got here in
the fall, I was nobody until Idecided
to leave. It was really strange.”

So the Bowen story at Pitt ‘has
been written. It's a strike against the
program that suffered much malign-
ment throughout the ‘82 season, one
that was supposed to be the dream
team. Theeffects are still being felt.
even in late May.

Krause Holds Key

continued from page nine

The Panthers were tamed by
Akron’s Mike Birkbeck, who Lewis
considered the best pitcher the team
faced this year.

“He was even better than any of
the Florida State pitchers,” he said.
“He owns all of Akron‘s pitching
records and was their first All-

. America in baseball.

' “There is no doubt that he is a
major league prospect."

Birkbeck’s performance oversha-
dowed the job done by senior left-
hander Tim McAloon.

“Tim threw the best game ever

» since he's been at Pitt," Lewis said.

‘_‘Akron just bunched a couple of

“It was a well played game.”

A type of game which may pave a
road to a 20-win season in 1984. The
entire pitching staff, with the excep-
tion of McAloon, will return. A plus
for the Panthers, considering the
importance of that aspect in base-
ball. The main problems for Lewis
will be replacement of the starting
outfield and half of the infield and

acquisition of some depth at catcher. .

Starter Doug Steiner and Dennis
Stitch are gone in 1984, along with
Mike Miller, LaCava andgcatchers
Tim Schwadron and Eric Reale.

“You just don't lose a .400 hitter
like Tony, two good catchers and

good defensive outfielders like Den-,

nis and Doug,” Lewis said. “There’s
a lot of if‘s but we should have a
good nucleus.”

To Success In 1984

Along with the pitching staff and
shortstop Westwood, Lewis may
benefit from the addition of two
football players, Matt Stennett and
Chris Jelic, both of whom were high
school standouts in baseball.

“I can understand why they
played spring football this year,” he
said. “As first-year players, they
have to fit into the football program.

“Hopefully, Foge will allow them
to play next season. Good athletes
add to a program.” ,

Stennett and Jelic would add to a
team looking for loftier goals next
season. Perhaps the opportunityto
play in the NCAA playoffs.

More Americans die from heart dis-
ease. stroke, and related disorders
each year thanall other causes of
death combined. according to the
American Heart Association.

Most people think heart disease hap-
pens only in the elderly. Yet, each

childhood heart diseases, according

“Unraveling Realities Behind Tennis Shoes

‘lay MA§K A. SINDLER

Tennis shoes, however looney it
may sound, have always played a
distinct part in the life I live.

It may be difficult to understand,

V‘ L’

iewpoint
but each time mom lugged me over
to that shoe store Ben owned, I

would always look forward to bran-
dishing a mint-condition pair often-

      

I * ‘L sﬁis shoes.

Ben has since retired, his former
store now a gallery full of women's
fashions. But when it comes to buy-
ing tennis shoes, some things just
never change. 1

There’s always that salesperson
(back during Ben’s days they called
‘em salesmen) who walks out of the
stock room and plops a couple of
sizes and styles down beside your
seat. The crisp sound of tissue paper
announces the opening of each box.

After the snow-white laces are
finally threaded through the eyelets,
there’s a certain rush your feel when
the cool, never-before-worn shoes
are slowly slipped over your feet.

Then there’s the customary short

Another one bites the

dust....

One Pitt football player was
declared ineligible for the 1983 sea-
son, and another may be coming
back. ‘

Cornerback John Lewis has been
suspended from school for two
terms. A native of Levittown, Pa.,
Lewis will be allowed to return for
the spring team of 1984.

Lewis went into spring practice as

spin around the store to get a prelim-
inary “feel” for the yet inﬂexible
shoes. Too much snugness against
the little toe can mean blisters in l0
days. A sliding heel might give way
to a stretched hamstring when the
pick-up game begins later that even-
ing. But, as a good salesperson
knows, the first fitting may be the
start of a loving relationship
between man and sneaker.

That relationship, which begins
after the handshake between sales-
person and buyer, may last any-
where from four months to four
years——-depending upon shoe type
and individual wear and tear.

As I said before, somethings never
change. But walking over to that
cash register is one aspect that has
been radically altered over just the
last several years. Yes, the prices
have changed, as have the compa-
nies that are now into tennis shoe
production. At least the exhilaration
of taking the first steps in the new
shoes is still not lost. Not yet,
anyway.

Take Nike, for example. I’m not
looking to give the Beaverton, Ore.-
based distributor any free PR, but
I‘m quite impressed by the products
it sells. I‘m still wearing a second-

hand pair of Nikes that I purchased
about two years ago. Granted, the
price was steep at the time, but if the
quality is there, I’ll pay for it.

Nike also carries styles that makes
the buyer seem heir-apparent to the
skills displayed by Dr. J. Simply put,
the shoes make you look good. Even
if your stuck in a 300-lb. frame or
were blessed with 5-3 height, its
swoosh symbol can persuade even
the most skeptical cynic that you can
slamdunk the basketball.

The demand for tennis shoes as
deemed necessary by a more
outdoor-oriented population and by
a “need” for status has been ade-
quately satisfied by the big-name
athletic shoe marketers. With the
increase in formal and nonchalant

jogging for fitness and firmness has .

come an explosion in running shoes.

Companies now have shoes that '

keep your Achilles tendon where it
should be while stresss is put on it.
Others offer shoes with
scientifically-molded soles to pro-
tect the vulnerable heel. Some run-
ning shoes are now made solely for
inclement weather conditions, oth-
ers are to be worn ifyou’re pregnant.

There are so many options availa-
ble now that buying arunning shoe

Meanwhile, the Panthers may be
gaining the services of defensive line-
man Dave Grillo. Grillo may be

reinstated for the Fall term and thus a

eligible for the 1983 season.

Since being suspended, Grillo
spent a semester at a junior college
and ‘returned to the university as a
part-time student during the winter.
As a freshman, Grillo was used
mainly in short yard situations.

Free for all....

Pitt athletic director Edward

Bozik said he doesn’t know the
effects a court ruling will have on the
university’s approach on television
rights.

‘Last week, the 10th United States
Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver
upheld a ruling which broke the
NCAA’s exclusive right to negotiate
television contracts.

‘In September, United States Dis-
trict Judge Juan C. Burciaga gave
Oklahoma and Georgia the right to
negotiate their television packages.

Bozik said Pitt supported the
NCAA position and believes some
form of regulation is needed.
