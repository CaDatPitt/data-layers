At the weekly session of
Pitt Town Meeting today, Dr.
John J. Geise, associate pro-
fessor of history and chief air
raid warden of the Cathedral,
.will present his “Comments

on Air Raid Precautions.”
According to Harold Gondelman,

‘e43, publicity director of Pitt Town

Meeting, Dr. Geise, due to his of-
ﬁcial position as air raid warden,
has a unique opportunity to pre-
sent to his audience all pertinent
facts concerning air raid precau-
tions.

He will reveal the plans drawn
up for the eastern air raid region,

A and explain how the defense set-up

of the Cathedral ties in with the
general master plan.

After explaining the nature of
air raid precautions and the neces-
sity of having such detailed pro-
grams, Dr. Geise will describe the
conduct and duties expected of
everyone during a raid.

Students in the Cathedral have
already gained some actual prac-
tice experience in air raid conduct
by the practice air raid drills that
Dr. Geise has held. These drills
have been successful in all respects,
he said.

The major point of Dr. Geise’s
speech is concerned with action in
the allied countries to further pro-
tection for civilian populations.

Pitt Town Meeting is schedul-
ed to be held in the Fine Arts
room, 324 Cathedral, at 2:30
o’clock today.

Commercial Eds

education will sponsor a panel dis-
cussion tomorrow at 2:30 o’clock

l-€i5€r Heads Fraternites Pledge

Committee

Irving Leiber, C44, has been
chosen to head a victory commit-
tee composed of three members of
Druids, honorary «activities frater-
nity for sophomore men. The two
other members of the committee
are Lawrence McBride, C45, and
Hugh C-havern, C45.

According to Thomas Moore,
C45, Druids vice-president, the
committee has been asked to in-
vestigate all possibilities for the
advancement of the war "effort at
Pitt and formulate a plan to al-
low the ﬁfteen members attend-
ing school this summer to par-
ticipate. All activity istof be in
harmony with the other Univer-
sity war programs.‘

“The resolution for the victory
committee was passed Wednesday
at the last Druid meeting, but the
appointment to confer with Theo-

dore W. Biddle acting dean of men, I

about the plan is not until tomor-
row afternoon. Tomorrow evening
Druids will meet again and decide
ﬁnally upon the plan to be follow-
ed,” Moore said.

Originally the honorary frater-
nity was to sponsor a tea dance
but the plan was rejected in view
of the small summer enrollment.

D’"'°l V’“°’Y Twenty-Nine Men;

Hit All-Time Low

Fraternities at the University turned in the lowest re-
sults for rushing week in school history this year, pledging
only.29 men to the Greek letter houses.

It must be remembered, fra-
ternity leaders pointed out,
that rushing this year was
carried out on a limited basis,
due ﬁrst to the scarcity of
erstwhile rushees, and second,
to the decision of the frater-
nities themselves to’ curtail
rushing expenses.

Another reason offered by fra-
ternity‘ leaders for the low num-
ber of pledges is that, under the
accelerated schedule, rushing had

to be carried on under the handicap

of heavy class schedules.

Toppled: was Delta Tau Delta
from their unchallenged rush-
week supremacy, as Phi Gamma
Delta turned in a total of nine men

to only four for the Delts. The.

second-place Delts can now only
remember last year when they set
an all-time University rushing rec-
ord, pledging twenty-one men.

Latest rushing returns from the
office of the dean of men, listed the

following men pledging to the fol-
lowing houses. ,

Phi Gamma Delta: Hugh Clem-
mer, Paul Goodwin, Donald Hillik-
er, Robert Irwin, Fred MacWil-
liams. John McMorris, William
Walters, Charles Ziel.

Delta Tau Delta: Harry Bloom-
er, Lester Blotkin, Thomas Carr,
James Haymaker.

Phi Epsilon Pi: Herbert Blumen-
ﬁeld, Howard Mermelstein, Jack
Reichbaum. 0

Phi Delta Theta: Paul Aller, For-
est Buterbaugh, Alfred Cupelli.

Pi Kappa Alpha: Milton Anton-
opolos, Donald Ledner.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon:
Kilpatrick.

Sigma Alpha Mu: William Levin.

Pi Lambda Phi: Coleman Meyers.
Sigma Chi: Dallas W. Heim, J r.,
Louis F. Marshall, Paul Bobenage,

A total of 96 bids were made
for men, according to ﬁgures from
the dean of men’s oﬂice.

Morale Institute Continues

By ALEX ZELENSKI

Pitt’s third in a series of
discussion groups sponsored
by the University Morale in-

stitute will be held under the ‘

direction of Dr. Charles Lo-
mas, instructor in speech,
Thursday afternoon at 2
o’clock in room 324.

Several months ago Pitt was

selected- as one of the key cen- 

ters of War Information and
Training in Pennsylvania, and Dr.
John Oliver, head of the depart-
ment of history, was put in charge.

Thus far, the Institute, which is
open to all students, has been a suc-
cess. The ﬁrst meeting consisted
of a round table discussion by vari-
ous professors in the University.
Last week’s was headed by Theo-
dore Finney, professor of music ap-
preciation, in which he discussed
“Music and National Morale.”

Thursday's program will be head-
ed by Dr. Lomas, who will explain,
in an introductory address, the
methods and purposes of discus-
sion. ,

A symposium composed of Pitt
debaters will hold a round table
discussion on “Our Enemies and
Our Allies.” Abe Bluestone will
present the Chinese picture of the
War, Howard Monsouir the Jap-
anese, Harold Gondelman, Great
Britain, Leonard Winograd the
Russian, and Holbert Carroll Ger-
many’s part in the present con-
ﬂict.

This discussion will be brief, and
will be followed by another round
table on “General Problems of the
War” in which the ﬁve debaters,
ﬁve speech students, and three high
school graduates will take part.
Harold Gondelman will be chair-
man of this group.

Dr. Lomas expressed the hope
that all students would attend the
Morale Institute Thursday after-
noon, which he believes will pro-
vide an interesting light on the
analysis and problems of the pres-
ent War. , , . . .

precede the invocation. The Lord’s
Prayer will be led by Rev. K. War-
riston McCracken of the West
View Presbyterian church. The
choir will sing A. Arlihangelsky’s
“Incline Thine Ear, Oh Lord,” fol-
lowed by the scripture lesson by
Rev. McCracken. I

After Hymn 187 by the congre-
gation and Dr. Franklin’s “Religion
in Crisis,” follows the processional
hymn (H—233), the benediction and
a period of silence.

The service will be brought to a
close by an organ postlude, “In Dir
Ist Freude” by Bach.

‘L Editor’s Note: This is the third of a series of dealing “education
ith direction,” or “total” education. Both terms denote the co-
dination and synthesis of everything about the University toward
one goal or direction.
That direction today is winning the war.
 In order to, best present; the picture of the new, "directional”
University each of its many phases must be considered separately—last
week’s editorial dealt with activities, today’s discusses honorary frater-
nities and the “new University.” ‘ '

=l< *
Honorary fraternities, or the gloriﬁcation of the “activi-

ties man” are through. Although their forms, names, rituals,-

keys, will.probably remain——nevertheless their basic purpose
Will, within a short time, undergo a_ radical change. V
_ For, as they have heretofore stood, honorary fraterni-
ies, Druids, Cwens, ODK, Mortar Board, the Junior Worthy
Awards, Hall of Fame," et. al., have merely been means of
bringing some recognition to leaders in the old, non-direc-

tional type of activity.
I As long as the University encouraged activities “honor-

faries,” it gave its approval to the activities they represented.

But now the University has removed its encouragement, ﬁnan-

_cial and moral, from activities not connected with the war

effort—so, as this summer, we ﬁnd a set of activities leaders
with no activities to lead. _

The honoraries can do either one of three things. They
can abolish themselves for the duration. Or they can continue
‘as they have been—inviting to membership leaders of out-

worn, useless activities. Or, ﬁnally, they can change to tie
themselves in with the direction of the University.
i‘ To do the ﬁrst thing, abolish themselves, is foolish and
on-constructive, because they already have the framework—-

group of people who, set straight on a few things, could do

much good.

i To follow the second course, a continuation of what
they have been doing, honoring the same kind of activities—
will lead to self-abolition, because honoraries depend upon
some sort of respect from the general student body for sur-
vival. And the majority of the student body now senses that
the old type of University is ﬁnished—that we are at last
seeing the beginnings of what education might have done
decades ago. Hence, to continue as they have been doing,
means that the time honored honoraries will be honored by
time alone. .- ‘
', . Now for the third choice—changing to meet the demands
if the “total” University. This is the only road that the hon-
rariescan take if they are to survive. They must no longer
fe regarded as “activities” fraternities. They must regard

emselves as “service” groups—uniﬁed with the direction of
he rest of the school.

And this has been realized. It has been realized by the
.much-kicked-around Druids, who have set up a‘ “Victory com-

mitteee,” and who plan, if necessary, to revise their whole
syear’s set of activities in an attempt to ‘cooperate with the
University at war. _ _
We believe that such steps from the otherhonoraries on
mpus must soon be forthcoming. Also forthcoming must be
leadership to tell, in concrete terms to-these groups, exactly
what they can do, how best they can serve. It seems logical
hat the ofﬁces of the Dean of Men and of Women must as-
ume this function. _

L . Either that or there will be no honoraries to write of.
. And then what’ll we do for commencement -ushers?

DuPont Cornelius, architect
and student at the University,

‘ has recently solved a problem

that has puzzled art histori-
ans for the past ﬁve hundred
years.

Two paintings, commonly called
the Frick Pietas, are the subject

of this age old controversy. The 
paintings are so similar that, ex- 
cept for some minor differences, =

they seem to be duplicates.

One of the two paintings, at pres-
ent in the Frick collection in New
York, depicts, in addition to the
traditional Christ and the Three
Marys, the donor of the painting or
the man in whose honor it was done.

The other, which hangs in the
home of Miss Helen C. Frick at
Pride’s Crossing, New York, omits
this ﬁgure of the donor but other-
wiseis almost an exact duplicate
of the ﬁrst. Although these two
Pietas are so similar, authorities
on the subject have been led to
believe that they were not done
by the same man.

As a result of century long con-
troversies and research these two
paintings were attributed to Hans
and Conrad Witz, father and son,
Swiss painters of the ﬁfteenth cen-
tury.

Cornelius set himself the task
of ﬁnding out which of the two
paintings was done by the father,
Hans Witz, and which by the son,
Conrad. “For this purpose he as-
sembled all the evidence "that ex-
isted. He examined all the paint-

his father painted the donor

ings of father and son, took into
account the lives, travels and

forces that might have inﬂuenced

the various members of the Witz
family.

Finally Cornelius found proof of
authorship in a signature in the
painting without the donor’s ﬁgure
which appeared also on two panels,
long acknowledged to be the work
of the son, Conrad Witz.

With this evidence it is now
ﬁrmly ‘established that the Pieta
with the donor was painted by the
father, Hans, while the one with-

' It offers all the advantages of

being a mailman (need we say
more?)—yet it doesn't require all
that tiresome hiking.

That just about describes Earl
Chalfant’s job at Pitt.’ Earl has
been in charge of the University
post office since last September.
He know swho is writing who—-
and how often.

Approximately 300 pounds of
'mail comes into the University each
day and at least that amount goes
out. Then there are those little
notes and oﬂicial papers which pass
between the different departments
within the building. Earl handles
it all, with the aid of those boys he
sarcastically calls his “stooges.”

And if you can judge popularity
on the amount of mail any depart-
ment receives, Earl will tell you
that the Registrar’s office is out in
front.r’I‘he Treasurer's office, how-
ever, runs a very close second.

‘ Outgoing mail indicates that
the soldier is the man of the hour
for at least 50 per cent of the stu-
dent mail goes to some army camp
or outpost. A lot of this “soldier
mail” is sent air mail to guaran-
tee quick delivery. Air mail let-

" ters can be sent to any man in the
service anywhere for just 6 cents.
When you consider that air mail
letters to Australia cost 70 cents,
it proves that even Uncle Sam’:

industries to show the usual gain

Bituminous coal production rose
last week as did electric power
production. Steel industry opera-

car-loadings advanced, but were
somewhat lower than the week
ending June 27.

Street railway and bus traffic in-

U. S. Army War show. Department

sales of 10 stores were 11 per cent

“It is particularly important dur-
ing these days that men and wom-
en who will soon be taking their
places in the victory effort, wheth-
er they ﬁnd work in defense indus-
tries or as workers in other agen-
cies, be placed in positions to which
they can contribute with maximum
efficiency. We haven’t time to ﬁnd
out aptitudes by the old-fashioned
trial—and-error method. That meth-
od takes time which is wasted to
the general effort of the country.
We want to ﬁnd out now whether
or not a certain man or woman has
sufficient manual dexterity to be a
good subject for training for ma-
chine work, whether this girl will
make a good nurse or secretary.
whether that boy will work well
with other people in administrative
work or should be assigned to a re-
search task where he will work
alone.”——Dr. Harry N. Glick, pro-

Post Office is “all out” for the

Although Earl cannot get the
stamps for his collection, he han-
dles quite a bit of foreign mail, par-
ticularly mail to and from England.
One of his prize possessions is a
registered mail receipt which came
back shortly after December 7th
from the Philippines.

It seems that Chancellor John
G. Bowman received a package
from the University of Manilla
shortly before the Japanese at-
tack. Earl signed the registered
mail receipt which was to assure
the syﬂders that the package was
received here. Late in February
the receipt came back—-—the mail
just couldn’t get through.

It is remarkably similar to a

keeping it to show his grandchil-

about how the Japanese interferred ~

Earl will probably get a lot of
interesting souvenirs before this
war is over. He has certainly seen
a lot of envelopes marked “censor-
ed" within the last few months.

But war or no war, Earl Chal-
fant and his “stooges” will go on
sorting the _mail, trying to locate
students who receive letters ad-
dressed to the University of Pitts-
burgh, and getting outgoing let-
ters ready for the four daily pick-
ups (10 o’clock; 12:30, 3:30, and
5:15).

It's an interesting job and it's
not hard on shoe leather.

Impressive’

To /Andreas of f Norway

By BILL PANKUCH

“Andreas of Norway,” Norwegi-
an ﬂier who visited the University
last Thursday, is a serious young
pilot convinced that the spirit of a
free, unconquered Norway is eter-
nal.

Since to reveal his true name
would cause death or suffering for
his family at the hands of the
Gestapo, the youthful air hero is
touring the United States under
this psuedonym. The purpose of
the tour is to secure funds in the
“Wings for Norway” drive, an ef-
fort to provide planes for Nor-
wegian refugees in training as
pilots.

At the present time, Andreas ex-
plains, there are over 1,000 Nor-
wegian refuges in training at
“Little Norway,” a settlement near
Toronto, Canada. Virtually all these
men made their way out of Norway
and across the ocean in little ﬁsh-
ing boats.

Still boyish enough to be delight-
ed that the police escort bringing
him to the .University passed
through red lights with screaming
sirens “without even getting a
ticket,” Andreas nevertheless is
mature beyond his 22 yeras.

His normal course of young
manhood was interrupted on April
9, 1940, when German troops pour-
ed into his homeland which had
been betrayed by the Quislings.
For the last year he has been
ﬁghting in the Royal Norwegian
Air force; trying to avenge those
Quislings. ,

Speaking clear precise English,
Andreas informs one that this lan-
guage was a course given at all
elementary schools in the once-
democratic Norway and Sweden.
His opinion of the Cathedral em-
bodies one of the better phrases he
saves for such occasions . . . “most
impressive.”

In his more serious moments he
speaks proudly and respectfully of
the people back home. It is his ﬁrm
opinion that the Norwegian civilian
resistance to German authority will
be as important a factor in the ulti-
mate freeing of Norway as will
actual military opposition.

Andreas and his companion, and
American-born Swedish aviator,
were brought to the Cathedral

from an Aero-Club luncheon at the
Hotel Henry by the Red Cross
Motor unit under Mrs. Ragnar
Berg. Mrs. Miller, University host-
ess, guided the party through the
Nationality rooms, where Andreas
was visibly pleased as he survey-
ed the Norwegian room, as yet in-
complete.

With a ﬁrm handclasp and a re-
utterance of his complete faith in
the ﬁnal victory of the democra-
cies over the tormentors who have
made a Hell of his homeland, the
young pilot walked out through
the revolving door on his way to
the University club to continue
his appeal for funds.

He turned around once more to
murmur . . . “Most impressive!"

Faculty
Introduces
Poetry Hour

Poetry reading hours have been
introduced this summer at Pitt by
members of the faculty for stu-
dents, faculty, and friends of the
University.

These weekly events are conduct-
ed during the summer session in the
Alldred room, on Monday after-
noons at 2:30 o’clock.

Various phases and types of
poetry are read in these poetry
reading hours. At the ﬁrst meet-
ing, Miss Ruth Haun, instructor

' in speech and chairman of the

Poetry Reading program, illus-

trated the early minstrel form.

with her reading of Alice Duerr
Miller's “The White Cliffs.”

On July 13, Buell Whitehill, as-
sistant professor of speech, read
war poetry from England and
America, and on July 20 Edwin L.
Peterson, assistant professor of
English, read poetry of the nine-
teenth century.

Thursday,‘ July 27, Dr. Michal A.
De Vitis,.‘ associate professor of

modern languages, will read Span- A

ish-American poetry and on Au-
gust 3,.Mrs. Agnes Lynch ‘Starrett,
assistant professor of English, will
conclude the series with poetry
from the Bible.

“Poetry reading is for person-
al enjoyment and relaxation and
poetry reading can be used as an
aid in building national morale,”
stated Miss Haun. ‘

“Thereading of verse has always
been a means of capturing and in
turn stimulating an emotional re-
sponse to an ideal, a rnood, of a
theme; witness the great dramas of
all time, the tragedies of Greece,
the drama of Elizabethean Eng-
land, the plays of our own Maxwell
Anderson; recall the poetry of Walt
Whitman, Carl Sand-burg, Stephen
Vincent Benet, who sing the song
o'f America. ‘*

“And in all great prose there is
also a kind of poetry, again found

in the writings of Sandburg and ~

Wolfe, the playwright Robert Sher-
wood, the radio playwright Norman
Corwin, and there is more poetry
in Lincoln’s ‘Gettysburg Address’
than in much of the world’s so-call-
ed verse.”

A program of student poetry
reading is being directed by Miss
Haun as a part of the program of
dramatic entertainment and na-
tional morale.

All interested students are asked
to meet in 1617A Cathedral Tues-
day, July 21, from 9:30 to 12:00:
o’clock and on Wednesday, July 22,
at 3:00 o’clock.
