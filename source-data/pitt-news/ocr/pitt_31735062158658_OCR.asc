‘Blast Superstitions .’.T. ‘

 

I . .~By,_ CLARENCE VVIBLE

It is the. primary purpose of
all_ educa.tiona.l_ institutions ‘to
provide the student with knowl-
edge that will, in the future,
better ‘him materially and in-
tellectually. But schools are in
a, piositiontzwhere  may also
take an active part in education

beyond and above mere intellectual
and material advancement.

Universities and colleges as the
highest courts of educationin the
land are at‘ last beginning to real-
ize, that __it is" in ._their power to-
blast superstition and taboos that
have 'been,_l_n’inde,ri,ng the onward
march of science and medicine.
Thus I feel that the universities’
attitude ‘towards the problem of
syphilisis an epochal step in the
right direction. V ,

Various_.medical authorities and
educational institutions have taken
the , ﬁrst all-important steps. in
combating syphilis. These medi-
cal and educational groups have
clariﬁed the issue to such an ex-
tent that it is i_nevitable,that the
government, grade and high
schools, and churches will lend
their more concerted support to
the movement in the near future.
‘Social Diseases’

Much well-deserved publicity
has been given to the University’s
part in the campaign against
syphilis. The ‘institutions of high,-
er education  over the country
may well be proud of themselves
in . their open-minded activity
against this disease.’

In aligning themselves with the
medical authorities of the country
who are trying to lift the stigma
of immorality from this_dread “so-
cial" disease, and to bring it out in
the open.where it may be more
successfully combated. American
universities and colleges are. at
least educating in the right di-
rection.

But education along _this line
must not be conﬁned to the higher
educational, institutions.
begin earlier. Now that we know
that syphilisis, to be treated as a
disease in a mature and scientiﬁc
manner. and not-as .a social evil,
to be whispered about byigncrant
anddirty-minded ignoramuses. it
is the problem of the public school
systems and the churches to see

that the truth about ‘syphilis is;
presented to their younger charges.  .» 0 g '_ 9 '_

to do it thorQ1.18hly.

A Baptist minister in the ‘middle; .

west grew tired of the ‘necessity of
evading the issue of sex and so-
cial diseases before his young peo-
ple. One morning he stunned the
old guard by preaching from the
pulpit about, syhilis; , _

He did riot. "obscure his address
with any remote Biblical refer-
ences. He presented facts, statis-
tics, and illustrations in an effort
to clarify his message. He put his
point over. Theold guard suc-
cumbed ,to,_.the logic of his message
and‘ stayed to cheer him.

Must Follow Examples

It is anlfexample like this that
we mustlfollow. If the subject of
syphilis‘ can be presented from the
pulpit, it can certainly be present-
ed without ill effects or embarrass-
ment in our public schools. It is
imperative that citizens know

about these things in their forma-

tive years.

Later on it maybe too late. This
is something both old and new
for our educational, spiritual, and
governmental superiors, to think
about.‘ _Let’s hope that they are
not ‘too busy.

BY RAY C. MACINTYARHE . I
More University ‘students favor the CIO than favor the

AFL or company unions.

, ,But don’t get excited. Almost as many as favor the CIO

are opposed to any union of workingmen whatsoever; and those,
taken together with thenot ineonsiderable handful of students

who vote for the AFL and com-
pany unions, far outnumber the
CIO industrial union adherents.

One critic has suggested that
the winning set ofianswers to the
ﬁfth Pitt News Student Poll, con-
ducted on‘ campus last week, and
dealing with important economic
questions, indicates “a typically
bourgeois, middle-class student
opinion; devoid of insight, above
all ambitious, yet dissatisﬁed and
little frightened, holding that

Such an opinion is based on the
following answers, in addition to
those on the union question, to the
poll questionnaire; , _ _ V

INDICATIONS LISTED

1, In general, the rich are not
taxed heavily enough.

2. A minimum wage law is de-'
sirable.

3. Business should be regulated
more, rather than less, by Govern-
ment. (A one per cent majority
opinion.)

4. Direct relief should be cur-
tailed.

‘5.,The government public works
program should be curtailed.

. 6. Government has undertaken
too many of the func_tions.belong-
ing to private business, and should

is that between men government

regulation and government own-
ership and operation.)

In answer to the question, “Do
you favor CIO, AFL, company
unions, or_no union,s?’.’ V 31 per
cent of those replying favored the
CIO, only 19 per, cent the AFL, 20
per cent voted for company unions,
and 30 per cent proclaimed their
opposition to unions of any kind,
shape, or form. . , . ,

WOMEN LEAD OPPOSITION

Women, to a large degree, ac-
counted for much of the opposition
to unions as such. Of those polled,
40 per cent voted against all un-
ions.

Engineers and Business Admin-
istration students are opposed to
unions more strongly than those
in the College and School of Edu-
cation. Both voted heavily _against
the three choices of CIO, AFL, or
company unions. College students
gave the CIO a break, awarding
John L. Lewis _42 per centlof their
votes. Business Administration
students, insofar, as they favored
unions, chose the AFL by 25. per

cent;,,20,per cent vot,ed_for',t,he CIO. t

‘Red Feather’ Day

Arrives Again

NIVERSITY students and faculty members
begin today the annual Community Fund
drive on campus for ’ student, contributions.
Speakers before second hour classes will pre-
sent plans, programs, and purposes of the Com-
munity Drive, and, as in the past, envelopes
will be distribtited for cash contributions and
pledged donations.

The drive deserves the full support of the
student body, especially since student organi-
zations will receive 75 per cent beneﬁt of each
contribution.

Goal set for the drive estimates an average of
one dollar dona.tions from every student. There
will be many, no doubt, who will be hard
pressed to meet the average, and there will be
others who, well-able to afford more than the
minimuiei average, will be tempted to donate
no more than that average.

Arguments presented every year still hold:
allowances may substitute donations for the
Weekly date; students, to take part in the
drive, should be ready and desirous of giving,
should consider the several responsibilities of
students at a University; ﬁnally, the need for
student contribution to a nation-wide charity
drive and to its particular campus recipients
is deﬁnite.

‘Flight, Not Fight’,
Says Record

From Washington last week came the reports
that the administration would balance the budget,
cutting all e.rpe'ndi.tures including W.P.A. and di-
rect relief.

The Philadelphia Record, recalling President
Roosevelt’s statement of November, 1936: “We
have just begun to fight,” ran an editorial entitled
“But This is Flight, Mr. President, Not Fight,’’, of
which the following is an excerpt.

=3 * 9.6
W E piled up a debt of $25,000,000 to win the
war. ‘

. VVe skimped on the ﬁght against the depres-
sion.

The 25 billions spent on the war poured into
the coﬁers of steel and munition makers and
bankers-—z'1.nd no one spoke of economy.

‘The money spent in the war against depres-
sion went in part to feed the hungry and in
feeding the hungry fed busine.ss—but the Tor-
ies now cry for “economy.”

And the economy is translating itself into
peaked faces of the children of the jobless. It
furrows the face of the needy farmer. It sends
the IV. I’. A. worker home hopeless with the
dreadful pink slip.

\Vhat Secretary Morgenthau implies but
doesn’t say is that the Federal debt has grown
so huge as to endanger Government credit and
the monetary stability of the nation. Of
course, this is not so. He speaks of the $14,000,-
0O0,000 deﬁcit for the four years ending June
30, 1937, as compared with the $22,000/000,000
deﬁcit for the two years ending June 30, 1919.

But he doesn’t make allowance for the in-
crease in offsetting assets of the Government
which amount to over $7,600,000,000.

The net debt increase is only seven billions.
The other seven billions is covered by assets,
cash on hand, excess gold in the Treasury, and
the securities of banks, business and cities
which borrowed from the R. F. C.

The net Federal debt June 30, 1937, was
271/; billion, only two billion more than the net
debt at the end of the VVorld \Var. Eliminate

World War,-—but that debt wasn’t publicized
by the reactionaries as a menace to the coun-
trv. ’ I 

Who ever heard of giving debt in terms of
gross rather than not in evaluating the true
economic position of a business ﬁrm?

Calamity, Dear:
By Irene Long

DEAR CALAMITY:
In your deﬁnition of a lady, you neglected to
mention that ladies are not cats. Let’s have a.

scorcher on catty women!
——DISGRUNTLED MAN.

\

DEAR DISGRUNTLED MAN: V

What’s the matter? Was it something you ate?
But you do have a right to be irritated about those
female varmints who traipse around prattling . . .
with dirks in their voices and dirt in their minds.

Yep! That about hits it . . . “dirt in their minds.”
If there is anything cattier than a growing child it
is a full-sized woman. One reason may be that
many parents simply think it’s cute when little
Henrietta sneers about Susie Jones’ scuify shoes and
the mend in her cotton stockings. Or when Junior
shrieks, “Yah, my old man is president of the bank,
and yours is on the WPA!” Such indications of
juvenile initiative merely look like revolting bad
manners to me.

If such trends are allowed to continue, uncurtailed
by parents, the probable outcome is a bad habit.
It turns into utter snobbery and selﬁshness. Worst
of all, it is jealousy. It may have been that Susie
Jones had scuffy shoes—-but a charming unspoiled
little self as well. Henrietta can combat the shoe
proposition with her shining little boots; but a mean,
narrow, spoiled personality just won’t stack up
against a cheerful, bubbling one.

Cattiness is the plant that develops from the seed
of jealousy. One sees it everywhere, unfortunately.
Sally Schmiggins sees Jimmy Beauwhistle being
snitched from under her freckles by Agnes Sniggle-
fritz. What does she do? Well, if she’s a poor sport
and a fool, she’ll unleash some verbal daggers at
the Snigglefritz girl that would make strong men
totter! But if she has any sense she’ll keep her chin
up, buy a new bonnet, keep her mouth shut, and
most important of all—keep her mind clear and un-
trammeled by jealousy. It can be done.

I know, too, of organizations on the campus
which are being threatened with disorganization
because of the prattling activities of certain mem-
bers who simplycannot mind their own business.
These rattlesnakes do their best to stir up trouble
among peaceful, busy, fun-loving students who
enjoy working and playing together.

You see, Mr. Disgruntled Man, not all those
with sharp claws are women. And I guess that
hits the male on the head!

In spite of the fact that the sight of Garbo usually
ﬁlls us with the urge to go hide behind our pet
eightball, we were considerably moved by the
Penn’s “Conquest.”

The costumes are beautiful to say nothing of
Garbo. And Boyer makes us forget Boyer and see
only Napoleon, sourpuss and all.

After going to school this far you ought to be
able to ﬁgure out a decent plot for this epic, but for
the beneﬁt of some stray law students we might ex-
plain that it is a “Boy Meets Girl” arrangement with
Napoleon as the boy and a certain Polish countess,
the girl. _

“The Merry-go-round of 1938,” currently show-

The picture as a whole is best described by the
immortal words of the insane Afghan philosopher,
Krashnimurti, who has a wide following among

The Queen Ant Said ‘Damn’

This was unusual for the Queen
Ant. She was, for the most part,
rather conservative. . Only on rare
occasions did she crawl out of the
ant hill and see how the workers

and drones were getting along. At
these times, she liked to watch
them hauling their puifed-rice-
like eggs.

But today. she was mad, hop-
ping mad. She .broke out again.
“Damn,” she said. This was a
rare occasion.

Everything was going wrong
out on top of the ant hill. They
were conducting an election for
Master Worker, and every scraw-
ny-legged female was perched on
top of a blade of grass, shouting
lustily. It was too noisy to hear
the crickets chattering under the
dying dandelion.

The Queen looked on. “Order,”
she bellowed. But no one noticed
her. One Amazon balanced on a
bit of timothy was declaiming
about the excellent work she had
done in the battle against the
grasshoppers.

“It was I who led you into bat-
tle. It was I who led the attack,”
she chortled. “It was I who kept
your spirits booming. It was I.
And now I ask you to consider
me. Let me be your leader if you
want valor and bravery in public
office. I promise you . . . ”

The Queen backed up against
the grass blade, pushed vigorously.

ground. No one noticed. The rest

declamations, spiritually thump-

One declared that she was qual-

emphasized that she was quali-
ﬁed by virtue of sternness. A One
ranted that she was qualiﬁed by

drone, children and a nice little
home in the center of the ant hill.

As the currents of emotion rose,
the tones became more and more
violent. Came the climax, and sev-
eral of the speakers climbed down
from their grass podiums, began
hurling invective and clods of
sand. Soon everyone was hurling
sand.

Many of them were bruised.
Some of the weaker workers
crawled off, buried themselves un-
der leaves. Others were busy,
viciously sawing away at their
neighbor’s necks. Antennae,
heads, legs, and decapitated bodies
spotted the ant hill.

One worker, bruised and swoll-
en, staggered about after the noise
had subsided. She spoke. “I as
victor, promise democracy for the
masses. We shall become an in-
dependent, strong, hardy, and uni-
ﬁed society. This I promise you.”
She coughed lustily.

The candidates never heard her.
Only the Queen Ant observed, and
she was nauseated. She snapped
up a few stray legs and, working
at them with her mandibles,
crawled back into the ant hill.

“Damn,” she said.

 Stephen Foster’
By William Colker

The Stephen Foster Memorial of the University is the larg-
est and ﬁuest of all memorials to the world~fa.mous composer.

But there is plenty of evidence that other sections of the
United States know and love the music of Pittsburgh’:-1 most
famed composer, and can show concrete proof of their regard.

Florida, through. which flows the Swanee River on its way
to the Gulf of Mexico, has made Foster’s Old Folks at Home,

other gift to Cincinnati, the ma-
terial in the Stephen Foster Me-
morial Room of the Library of
the University of Cincinnati.

This room contains ﬁrst edi-
tions, facsimiles of letters and
manuscripts, and various articles
relating to Foster’s life and works.
With the exception of the Uni-
versity’s collection, this is one of
the largest Foster collections in
existence.

Indianapolis is one of the cen-
ters of Foster interest. It was
here that Mr. Lilly founded his
Foster Hall Collection in 1930. At
one time the staff consisted of 11
persons, engaged in research,
cataloguing, and other activities.

Best Advice
To State-

Don’t Score

By LEONARD LEVISON
Sports Editor

Dear Grover . . You’re a
pretty good guy and a pretty
good end at that. And as a
brother Druid, I oughta give
you a little advice on what to
do when you and your Penn
‘State boys come down to town
next Saturday. There’s only
one thing I have to say——Don’t
taunt the Panther, and by all
means, don’t score.

If you want any further corro-
boration, write the boys from
out “where the west begins.” The
Cornhuskers brought one of their
huskiest teams here Saturday and
they looked plenty good. They
made only one mistake.

MISTAKE REPEATED

Yes, and in a way they should
have known better. They had
Link Lyman in the press box at
South Bend the week before and
he should have told them. Notre
Dame made the identical mistake.

They both scored a touchdown in _

the third quarter. Now, if you
really must push a touchdown
across, the only time to do it is]
three seconds before the game
ends.

And even that’s not such a good
idea. Because Marshall Goldberg
is just dying to run back a kick-off
for a touchdown.

It seems that Jimmy Crowley
had the right phnosophy. His
Fo-rdham boys just didn’t score.
Consequently, nothing happened in
New York to get the Panther dan-
der up. There is quite an articu-
late mass of expert opinion that
ﬁrmly believes that both Notre
Dame and Nebraska might have
ended up with the one of those ego-
swelling scoreless ties if they
hadn’t of had such poor foresight
and grabbed a touchdown.

TOO TOUGH

Of course, we can’t sit in this
school of thought ourselves. Be-
cause, after watching Mar-
shall and Curly and Frank and
even young Dick Cassiano run-
ning around for seven Saturdays,
we just can’t conceive of how any-
body is going to hold them for
four quarters without some ef-
fective pop-oﬁ on their part.
Especially when Tony, and Al. and
Soo-chow are clearing the way.

You must have read the Sunday
morning accounts of what hap-
pened in the Stadium on Saturday
afternoon by now. But, you really
couldn’t appreciate it unless you
saw it.

FIRST HALF SLOW

It was another one of those days
in which you sit with your ﬁnger
nails taking a terrifﬁc biting and
then after it’s all over you won-
der to yourself why you ever
had one little worry about that
Pitt team. It seems that it can’t
lose. ,

During the ﬁrst half, it was just
another ball game. There was
some very nice defensive work by
our cousins from Lincoln. They
got in some vicious tackles that
set the boys down so that they
knew they were being set down.
But, they did it in the same way
they always have. They played
very clean ball. You remember
what Muggsy used to say about
the Nebraska teams. “The hard-
est and toughest, but absolutely
the cleanest.” That still holds
true. '

DODD RUNS

When the third quarter got un-
derway Biff Jones’ boys whipped
out two beautiful plays. Johnny
Howell, a ﬁne quarterback, sent’
a punt zooming over Goldberg's
head. It traveled 72 yards. Biggie
brought it back to the Pitt 14.
Then Bill Stapulis let one boom
off his toe.

Harris Andrews caught it on his
own 40-yard line, began running
towards the north sidelines, and on
his way over, slipped the ball to
Jack Dodd, who was coming up
from the other end. Dodd, who is
a trackman, raced down the op-
posite side behind very efﬁcient
blocking for 60 yards and a touch-
down. English, a Cornhusker
guard, made the point good and
made the score, 7-0, Nebraska.

Well, then the boys didn’t need
any bonﬁres or any pep rally.
They started to growl, and with it
play that kind of fourth quarter
football that makes them the ﬁnest
football team in the nation.

MARCH BEGINS

After a flat pass was intercepted
by Fred Shirey, the Panther aerial
attack ended for the day. They
started a running attack on
the 20-yard line. They would
go into that single wing-
back and plough through either the
right or the left side. It didn’t
really matter whether Goldberg or
Stebbins carried the ball.

When they got down to the six

AROLD “CURLY” STEBBIN S, Panthers’ ﬂeet right halfback, who
has added an extra bit of drive to his running style. As a result
he has given Pitt a real running threat from both sides of the attack.
Stebbins’ excellent play Saturday aroused favorable comment from
Dr. Sutherland. 1
One of the advantages that Stebbins has had is that every team
that plays Pitt concentrates their defense on Marshall Goldberg. Now,
after two successive days of individual brilliance, Stebbins has proven
that he is one to be reckoned with when it comes to halting Pitt.
Teamed with the incomparable Goldberg, he gives Pitt the finest of-
fensive combination in the country.

yard line, Patrick started driving.
First he picked up ﬁve yards. And
then he just lunged through a hole
in the Nebraska line that was
reminiscent of those wide, open
prairies. Total length of march--
80 yards.

Souchak’s kick hit the upright,
but there were still 10 minutes left
to be played. Lezouski recovered
a fumble on the 33-yard Nebraska
line. Stebbins ran around left end
for 20 yards and then Cassiano put
it in the spot for a Stapulis line
buck. Within six minutes, right
after Souchak’s kick, the score was,
Pitt 13—Nebraska 7.

So, now you can understand my
admonition. Those two marches
of 80 yards and 33' yards were
made just as easily as you can
snap your ﬁngers. They were
made because the Panther was
aroused. He was in danger of
losing.

GOOD PLAY FEATURED

Once he gets the feeling-—that
he has to score or he’ll be beaten
—there’s nothing that can stop
him. It must be a throwback to
his days in the jungle. At least,
the ferocity of his attack indicates
as much.

There was plenty of good ball
played out in the Stadium Sat-
urday before the second largest
crowd that ever nudged into the
bowl. Tony Matisi and Don Hens-
ley were demons on the defense.
Frank Souchak , and Al Lezouski
played the same kind of game
thay have played all year, and
you know how really good that
is.

The boys are of the opinion that
Charley Brock is a great center,
and they rank him above Wojy.
Elmer Dohrmann at end for the
Huskers was strong.

Even thongh the Cornhuskers
did, have an apparently healthy
lead at one time, there was no
question as to the Pitt superiority.
We had 13 first downs to the
Cornhusker’s 2, and that vaunted
line made Nebraska vaunta go
back to the prairies. The Corn-
huskers ended up with a net aver-
age of minus 9 yards gained from
scrimmage.

I know that you are too smart
to try the same thing.-Lenny.

Highlights
Highlights? ? ? ? ? A feature
started in this column last week
of rating Interfrat touch-football
players will be continued through-
out the touch-football season . . .
this rating is based on the same
policies as the All-American
Board . . . outstanding players of
each game will be mentioned after
each game and The Pitt News All-
lnterfrat team will be chosen
from this list of eligible players
at the end of the season . . .

The lineman, usually pushed in-
to the shadows by the more spec-
tacular backs, has at last come
into his own . . . In Greek battles
fought so far on Schenley Oval
hard lineplay has been the high-
light of each combat . . . Lambda
Chi sported a fast charging line
and a bullet passer to turn back
-Kappa Sig . . .

Theta Chi’s ends repeatedly
rushed SAE passers and hurried
them to the extent that their pass-
es were ineifective . . . In like
manner did SAM ﬁnd Sigma Chi
just a little too powerful in the
line to successfully get the jump
on them. ,

All-Interfrat Ratings that came
out of the Pi Lam-Delt game last
Friday: Cooper, ﬂashy Delt back;
Bill Berg, rugged end for Delt;
Morty Weisman, Pi Lams right
end who made the tenth ﬁfth man
in the Delt backﬁeld . . . Mr.
Rocker the boys can’t play ball in
the dark . ._ . please try to move
the hours of play up a little .
and things we can do without to
speed up the game and eliminate
arguments on the ﬁeld, the slow
whistle . . .

All-Interfrat Rating must also
be given John Treddenick. “Tred”
a Delt man played a bang up
game on the defense and curious-
ly enough the wonder man center
also caught the pass that gave
Delt their victory over Pi Lam
. . . to cap his doing of today
“Tred” snapped short Pit Lams
only threat by intercepting a pass
deep in his own territory . . .

Tournament

With a freshly organized Orien-
tation League prepared to begin
operation in the touch football
round-up, Intramural athletics
will have the juciest turnout that
has beensqueezed out of the stu-
dent body since its advent onto the
campus four years ago.

This new group, created through
the action of paternal Men’s Coun-
cil, is‘ the ﬁrst deﬁnite attempt in
class Intramural organization. The
various teams represent Orienta-
tion classes and will play among
themselves for the championship
of the Class of 1941, and subse-
quent Intramural honors.

COMPETITION BEGINS

Bunched together in one elimin-
ation tournament are twelve Ori-
entation teams. They start play
tomorrow afternoon at 12:45
o’clock on the Trees Field.

Classiﬁcation of teams in this
unit are by the section letters list-
ed on scheduled cards. Thus Ori-
entation class “la” becomes team
“A” in the tourney parlance.

Team lff will meet team lgg
and Ic is lined against G. in the
opening games tomorrow noon.
It’s all very simple to understand.
As simple as the A, B, C's.

According to the schedule that
has been formulated by Harvey
Rocker, director of Intramural
athletics, and Herbert Rackoif,
chairman of the Council’s Intra-
mural comrnittee, eleven games
have been arranged to bring the
two surviving teams up to the ﬁnal
round.

Only two games will be played
each day, the playing days being
Tuesday and Thursday. All ﬁrst
round games, involving each of

the twelve registered teams, will .

be completed by Tuesday, Novem-
ber 30. V

PLAY FOR TITLE

‘ The champion of the Orienta-
tion League will earn the right to
meet, in further elimination com-
petition, title holders in the Inter-
fraternity and Independent organ-
izations in order to determine the
Intramural champion.

With the Greeks already hot in-
to their tourney, the Independents
swing into the bandwagon this aft-
ernoon. Two games, involving
the Politicos, Homines, Legis,
ChemE’s and Metallurgists, are on
the slate. '

The barrister grouping pits the
Politicos against the Homies Le-
gis and the engineers will have
their own little party with the
Chem E’s meeting the Metallurg-
ists.

Pi Lambs

Long Forward  
Wins For Delts,
‘Treddenick Stars

Delta Tau Delta 7; Pi Lamba
Phi 0.

Delta Tau Delta, with but ﬁfteen
second remaining in the ﬁrst half
of their game ~with Pi Lam sent
Pledge John Treddenick down to
catch a Chuck Cooper pass for the
only score of a hard-fought battle.

All through the ﬁrst quarter
both teams scrapped tooth and nail
with possibly an edge going to
Delt only because Jaffe, P‘. Lam,
got off a couple bad boots.

With the opening of the second V

period, Delt began to move. Their
line outrushed Pi Lam, Pi Lam
passes fell harmlessly to the
ground, ﬁnally, Delt pushed Pi
Lam towards their goal by super-
ior punting.
LONG PASS

In the closing minutes of the pe-
riod Delt took possession of the
ball just inside Pi Lam territory.
On the next play Chuck Cooper,
who had been doing beautiful
passing all during the game, un-
corked a perfect pass to Tred-
denick on the ten-yard line.

“Tred” was caught on the goal
line and the ball was put in play
ten yards out from the north side-
lines directly on the pay dirt
stripe.

At this point, the Delts called
time to stop the clock and give
them the time necessary for the
play that decided the game.

COOPER THROWS

Treddenick took his usual posi-
tion at center and snapped the ball
to Cooper. Cooper faked to the
left and let go to “Tred” in the
end zone for the only score of the
day. Cooper tossed to Bill Berg
for the conversion.

Pi Lam made one threatening
gesture late in the ﬁnal canto. A
blocked punt on the Delt ten-yard
line made things very interesting
until Pi Lam’s Jaife fumbled and
lost fifteen yards. This reverse
was never made up again and Delt
took the ball on downs.

The game ended a few plays
later and Delt moves into the
third round by virtue of a bye in
the second round. The Bayard
Street boys meet the Sigma Chi-
Phi Delt winner Tursday, Novem-
ber 18.

Games tomorrow include the
Theta-Chi Lambda Chi tilt and
Sigma Chi takes on Phi Delt. Both
these games are second round
fracases and will be played on
Schenley. Oval. ‘ '

Teams In IC4A Meet Today

Running over the Van Cort1andt¢*

Park course in New York this aft-
ernoon, the Pitt varsity and fresh-
man hill and dale teams will com-
pete in the annual IC4A champion-
ships.

Coaches Olson and Potts left
with their respective teams Satur-
day. Two years ago the varsity
placed fourth in this competition,

but slipped to ninth last year.
Their chances this year, with an
inexperienced team, are meager.

Highest expectations are held for
the freshman outﬁt, which is un-
defeated in dual competition.

Al Zamborski and the Kopec

Pi’-of. Leighton

Obtains Books

For Collection
Typical Speciinens
From West, Coast,
New York Exhibited

Henry Leighton, professor

. and head of the department of

geology, has placed on exhibi-
tion the new additions to the
department ’s collection of fos-
sils, minerals, and rare rocks in
the minerology laboratory, 1228
Cathedral.

Many of these specimens were

collected by Mr. Leighton on his:

trip to the west coast in June, and
on his -trip through New York
state in August. Among these are
typical rocks of Yellowstone park
and of Glacier National park.
Most interesting of all, is a curi-
ous mineral that he picked up in
Was_hington._ Itpis commonly called
mountain leather or mountain
cork; it is so named because, al-
though_it is a natural mineral, it
has a spongy felt-like texture.
t Pennsylvania’s contributions to
the collection include a crinoid
head found by Dr. R, E. Sherrill,
associate professor of Geology and
acting head of the Department of
Oil and Gas; a rare ﬁsh spine found
by Mr». Leighton; and an unusual

- root found by Miss Theiss.

Among recent purchases shown
is a perfectly polished sphere of
topaz, the only one of its kind in
the world, also a few ﬁne cut
sapphires of _ unusual color, and
some cut sphalerite.

Even China is represented with
sorne..9arves1....:ieds.,.._pxaxer Pieces
and some jade elephants.

News Poll Shows cio
Margin Over AFL

( from Page One)

that taxes are apportioned on a .

pretty just and equitable. basis.

Sentiment, is clear-cut on the
minimum wage question also. Stu-
dents answer “Yes!” to the query,
“Should we have" a minimum
wage law*?” by a vote of 73 per
cent to 27 per cent.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

By a scant margin of one per
cent,’ the opinion that government
shouldstep in and do a little more
regulating of private business is
predominant. Percentages tally: 38'
per cent, that more regulation is
desirable; 37 per cent, that too
much regulation has already been
effected; and 25 per cent, that reg-
ulation now, in effect is, for the
most part, just what is required
for the public welfare.

Business Administration and
Engineering student majorities
stick together in asserting that too
much regulation has been imposed
on private business. Of the College
students, 40 per cent say that too
little regulation has been imposed;
28 ;per cent think the opposite is
true; and 17 per cent maintain that
existing regulation is both desir-
able and adequate.

Education students voted 42 per
cent in favor of more regulation;
23 per cent against existing regu-
lation; and 35 per cent in favor of
existing regulation, rather than
more or less.

. PUBLIC WORKS

Public works, should be curtail-
ed,,declare- 41 per cent of the un-
dergraduate student body. In the
opinion of 31 per cent, it should
be increased; while in the opinion
of 28 per cent it should be kept
the. same.

Education students above all
others want an increase in this de-
partment, voting '60 per cent in
favor of Hﬂarging the program.

No. other school shows a majority,

in favor of increased public works.

Direct  relief is _ , unpopular, as
proven by the fact that 70 per cent
of all the students advocate its
curtailinéiit. It should be kept the
same, in the opinion of 20 per
cent, and increased, in the opinion

of 10 per cent of the students. ,
“Do you think the government

has undertaken too many,

custom to private business?”
To this question, 45 per cent as-

sert that government has usurped;
too many of the prerogatives of

private business, while 39 per cent

claim government has not done.
enough—-—that it should take over’
even more functions. Yet 16 per

cent of those questioned think
government has assumed,as many
extra-governmental functions as
it should.

Education and College students

think, for the most part, that we-

should have a more pervasive gov-
ernment. Of those, Education stu-
dents’ voting, 40 per cent held this
opinion; of College students, 51
per cent.

Engineering and Business Ad-—

ministration students remain con-
servative, 85 per cent of the En-

gineers contending. that govern-'

ment has already done too much,
while approximately 50 per cent
of the business students chorus
their agreement.

Librarian Elected  

Section Secretary

Mrs. Lorena Garloch Byers,
reference librarian in the Univer-

sity library, was elected secretary.
of the college and university sec-,
tion of the State Library Associa-

tion at the group’s annual conven-
tion at York, Pa., last week.
Highlight of the meeting, as de-

scribed by J. Howard Dice, _Uni-’

versity librarian and delegate to

the convention, was a panel dis-‘

cussion on “The Place of the Li-
brary in the Educational Program
of the College and University.”
The object was to interest students
in reading books other than those
that are required. . .. .

Basis of the discussion was a
study made in Chicago over a two-
year ‘period, which showed that 96
per cent of the students read no
more than the required reading.

    PoliticaliScience Hcodrs
  Conference..

 ’Pr9f¢S$5fS Give 
:Critica1ReVi<=W;  
Of Basic come

T_h0ugh_ the political science
department of the University
of Pittsburgh ranks foremost
among the great colleges of the
country, the department heads
held an informal conference

Thursday to, discuss ways of.

effecting changes in the present
method of instruction.

_ T_hursda_y’s conference was de-
voted largely/to a_ critical review
of Introductory Political Science
1 and 2.; A

Charging tihatits setup today
covers an _entir,_ely inadequate
range of general information, espe_-
cially for those who do not seek to
continue further in its study, some
instructors’ advised the initiation
of. _a cultural introductory. course.

‘ They felt that, perhaps not di-
rectly connected _with practical
politics, the average. citizen should
have a cultural knowledge of
world governments everywhere,
rather than a singular training
about his own. _

INSTRUCTORS .DISAPPROVE

Other instructors, however, dis-
approved of the suggestion. Louis
Johnston, instructor in the depart-
ment, pointed out the inconsistency
of such a program. “Shouldn’t a
student have a thorough knowl-
edge of his own government be-
fore he begins studying about the
others?” he asked.

“We should concentrate all our
energies in making the average
student government—conscious, at
least to the extent that he in later
life will participate in its organi-
tzaion intelligently.” .

Student reaction toward a cul-

V

"tural co.urse in political science
~was varied, though the preponder-
ance of opinion "seemed to be in
favor of the present method of in-
struction. Most of those ques-
tioned described their basic rea-
son for taking the course- “was to
‘learn something about practical
politics.” . And, they maintained,
a substitution of a political science
survey would considerably weaken
its service.
STUDENTS COMPLAIN

Strong student. sentiment, re-
flected tosome extent at the con-
ference, came out for a more nar-
rowed coursethan even the present
one, encompassing a practical
study of politics and politicians in
the United States. ,

Indications, as gained from both
student and faculty’ opinion, point-
ed to a continuation of introductory
political science instruction ac-
cording to present speciﬁcations.
