SGB faces early setback

Online allocations program delayed to March

Carla Trinca— Conley
Staﬁ’ Writer

Technical difficulties have delayed
a new Student Government Board
program designed to make allo-
cations for student organizations
paperless.

Charlie Shull, SGB president, said
the new online program, Symplic-
ity’s Student Group Management
System, will not be up and running
until March.

Shull started working on the
Symplicity project when he was a
member of last year’s board, and
although no official start date was
announced, the program was sup-
posed to begin at the start of the
spring semester. '

A technical problem delayed
starting the program, which is run
through Symplicity, a software com-
pany. .
Engineers employed by Symplic-
ity, and trained in the Student Group
Management System, attempted to
enter all Pitt students’ names and
Peoplesoft numbers through a mass

upload. But Shull said the single up-
load was unsuccessﬁil.

The new program might have en-
countered the problem because Pitt
uses students’ Peoplesoft numbers
as a type of social security number,
he said. The engineers will now
have to manually type each name
and Peoplesoft number of about
34,000 people individually. S

This delay will not cost Pitt any
additional money because the en-
gineers are working on contract
through the Student Organization
Resource Center, and the added time
is a part of the operation costs, Shull
said.

When it’s ready for use, the Stu-
dent Group Management System
will be a new device for organiza-
tions during the allocations pro-
cess.

Student groups’ presidents or
business managers log into their ac-
counts, instead of going to SORC -in
person, to request money. The new
system will allow groups to monitor
and track their requests during all
stages of the allocations process.

Shull said once the transition

has been made, the program will
allow allocations submissions to go
paperless.

“It saves thousands upon thou- l

sands of pages of paper a year,” Shull
said.

Shull said the new system is a
continuation of the former board’s
initiatives to make the campus
paper-free.

The system, when working prop-
erly, will allow each Pitt student to
sign in with his or her username and
password, Shull said. He said the
web page will have public calendars
with events posted for students to
look at. _

Students who are involved in
groups could look up the name of
their group in the search engine and
“join” it.

Once accepted into their speciﬁc
student group, they have access to
the private calendar, updated by a
person in their group.

Group members also will have
access to automatic updates from
their organization through Face-
book or text messages, Shull said.

Haiti aid could hurt more than help, panel says  

Eric Shannon
Staﬁ Writer

Giving aid to Haiti could cause a “second
disaster,” one health expert has said.
Last night, nine experts debated the
best ways to properly aid Haitians at a
panel organized by Joanne Russell, the
director of Pitt’s Center for Global Health.
The experts, whose specialties included

medicine, philanthropy and international
affairs, agreed that Americans should re-
think how they provide relief to disaster-
stricken countries. ,

In the immediate aftermath of last
month’s Haitian earthquake, there was
_an extraordinary outpouring of support
for the country, already the poorest in

the Western Hemisphere. But it’s possible A

this aid could cause more harm than good,

Russell said. ,

“All of a sudden, well-"intended people
send things or arrive on the ground to
help. It can actually siphon away resources
that are needed in the emergency,” Russell

said. “Often, these countries don’t havea‘

place to store these goods. They have to
spendimoney on storage containers for

it, or they don’t have a_way to distribute

goods.”

In many cases, these donations are _

useless in the situation, she said. People
sometimes send powdered baby formula to
victims whodon’t have access to clean wa-
ter or heavy blankets and coats to people
living in warm climates. . A
Panelist Kathleen Hower related her
"own experiences with well~intentioned but
unhelpful donations. She’s the coifounder

help build relationships between them.

The system gives SGB, the allocations com-
mittee and other groups a chance to create ros-
ters and send e—mails to individuals, possibly
making it easier for groups to communicate
within themselves, as well.

Shull plans to have the Board and alloca-
tions members go through training by the
time students come back from spring break
in March. Both SGB and Symplicity will offer

SGB plans to contact groups’ presidents,

through its contact lists, as well as SORC.

Shull said he is taking a “cautious approac ”
to the transition because it is a completely new
way of going about allocations requests.

As president of SGB, Shull will have in-
creased access to the system, but it will also

ing to LED lamps, said Lindsay Baxter, his
sustainability coordinator. She said the
mayor’s office is awaiting the results of
further Pitt studies currently underway,
but that the conversion could begin this
summer. ’

City Councilman Bill Peduto, who rep-
resents parts of Oakland and Shadyside,
released a report saying that each LED lamp
will cost $500. According to the report,
factoring in the cost of installation would
run the total cost to about $24 million to
replace the city’s 40,000 streetlights.

Michael Cherock,/founder of Power-
house Design Architects and Engineers, is
working to create a lighting code that would

.set lighting standards for the city.

“We will have to buy a progressive tech-
nology that’s still in its infancy, but there
are so many potential rewards that make
it enticing,” Cherock said.

To pay for the lights, the city would
use state funding provided by theiGua_r-
anteed Energy Savings Agreement, which
helps cities and buildings become more
environmentally friendly. What the state
funding doesn’t cover, the city would pay
off over a period of«15 years or less using

its savings.

Bilec and Marriott completed their study
with help from Pitt’s Mascaro Center for
Sustainable Innovation._They were part
of a task force that included Ravenstahl,
Peduto and lighting consultants.

Bilec, Marriott and three Pitt under-
graduates installed different bulbs in 150
streetlights in the South Side. They mea-
sured energy usage, the bulbs’ longevity,
quality and environmental friendliness.
They also gathered public opinion. A

They found that while the LED lights are

' m6re’éx1:e‘ri‘si§ze.tc pmaaae;:i1eyaa1y.ase93

watts of power, compared to the 230 watts
of power the current high-pressure sodium

' lamps use. The LED lamps also last 10 to

15 years, while the High Pressure" Sodium
lamps last two to four years.

The study also found that switching to
LED lights would reduce the city’s carbon
dioxide emissions by 6,818 metric tons per
year, or about one—third.

There are a few "areas in which other
lights trump the LED bulbs. ;

LED lights might disturbsome local
animals. L

“There’s an issue with the temperature.
It can disrupt circadian rhythms of certain
species,” Bilec said. - '

V The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported
that the LED lights cast a bluish glow that
prevents people from seeing colors accu-
rately. Peduto’s report, however, says LEDs
“produce a white light that stimulates the
rods andcones of our eyes.”

LED lamps have already been installed
on Walnut Street in Shadyside, part of Pedu-
to’s district. Peduto said, “The superior
quality of the lighting is obvious.”

Haiti struggle unique

supplies for redistribution in developing
countries.

For instance, people see news reports
of Haitians needing water and collect
bottles of water. Then they call her ofﬁce
after learning the Red ‘Cross only takes
ﬁnancial donations. _

“I say, ‘No, drink the water and send

us money,”’ Hower said. I

Other problems arise because the in-

ternational community often isn’t pre-
pared to coordinate relief efforts between
nations and relief organizations, some
panelists said. In those cases, the aid can
actually become counterproductive.

“We have 650 international organiza-
tions, 60 on health problems, and this is
completely disorganized,” Paulo Teixeira
said. Teixeira serves as the regional ofﬁ-
cer of urban health for the Pan American
Health Organization, a regional ofﬁce
of the World Health Organization that
promotes the improvement of health and
living standards in the Americas.

Louise Comfort, a professor in the
Graduate School of Public and Interna-
tional Affairs, said the United Nations’
new cluster approach can help alleviate the

problem. Under this method, the United

Nations groups organizations according to
the type of aid they provide. Those groups
then report to a lead organization.

“People have recognized before that
this could work, but we now have the
communications structure to do this,”
Comfort said.

But it’s often hard to keep the aid com-

ing. People tend to stop focusing on dev~ '

astated countries after they send their
initial donations of money or goods. But
countries still need aid during for the
rebuilding process, which is critical for
recovery.

Because it is one of the world’s poorest
countries, Haiti will struggle more than
some others would.

The country must alter its building
codes to protect against future quakes,
build infrastructure and restore education
to a country with a 64 percent illiteracy
rate, panelists said. This will be a hard
task, since the government hordes the
nation’s wealth, Steven Williams, medical
director of Green Tree Medical Associ-
ates, said.

But Comfort hasn’t lost hope.

“The international spotlight is on Hai-
ti,” Comfort said. “One only needs to look
at the signiﬁcant change that happened in
1985 in Mexico City or Indonesia inl20o4.
I’m very optimistic.”

Teixeira suggested that universities

I could help by adopting ‘a town. Universi-

ties, he said, have very specialized knowl-
edge that can help people better under-

stand the problems they face and develop
solutions to those problems.

Other panelists included Kathleen
Buechel, director of the GSPIA Philan-
thropy Forum, Mary Carrasco, director
of international and community health
at Pittsburgh Mercy Health System, Kent
Harries, professor of engineering and
Samuel Stebbins, professor of epidemi-

ology.

Nutrition labels.
worth a look

hilly cheese steaks aren’t
P healthy. But if you’ve ever

really wondered just how
high the nutrition numbers are
and you live in Philadelphia, you
won’t have to estimate, ask or
strain your eyes over tiny nutri-
tion labels any more.

Earlier this week, Philadel-
phia initiated its new menu-
labeling law. It requires chain
restaurants to list caloric content
of all food items directly on the
menu boards. But that’s just the
start of it.

While other U.S. cities have
started similar labeling policies,
Philadelphia’s is the most strin-
gent, according to The Philadel-
phia Inquirer. Beginning on April
1, restaurants — not just chain
restaurants, but sit-down and in-
dependent restaurants — will
have to list extensive nutrition
information of food items in their
menus. The list includes saturat-
ed fats, trans fats, sodium, carbo-
hydrates and of course, calories.
Philadelphia has taken a com-
mendable step toward bettering
residents’ health — or at least
has made it possible for them
to make more health-conscious
choices. But the action comes at
a critical time.

Philadelphia City Council ap-

proved this policy in 2008. Those
cheese steaks have taken on a toll
on the city’s bloated waistline:
Approximately one—third of
Philadelphians are obese, which
is about on par with national
obesity rates. Council members
saw other disturbing data that
prompted their decision. Broken
down by district, 13 percent of
residents are diagnosed with dia-
betes while 36 percent have high
blood pressure —— percentages
that are above national rates.
Donuts are calorie-dense and
high in fat —— everyone knows
that. But not everyone knows ex-
actly how calorie—packed and fat-
tening, or otherwise detrimental
to health, some prepared foods
are. Yes, nutrition information
—— at least in chainand fast—food

restaurants — is generally avail-
able online or upon‘ request, but
who really takes the extra step to
access that information?

Not many U.S. cities have
passed labeling laws. New York
was the ﬁrst to pass such a law,
yet Philadelphia is only the
fourth to implement the labeling
policy. The only real burden in
enacting such a regulation rests
on the independent restaurant
owner, should a city require all
restaurants to provide the data.
Independent restaurant owners
would have to revise menus ex-
tensively and calculate nutrition
information. Some of their more
unhealthy menu items might not
have the loyal following of, say,
McDonald’s Big Mac, which prob-
ably won’t be going anywhere
anytime soon despite menus
that bare all. Still, if more cit-
ies passed labeling policies even
in chain restaurants, that would
mark signiﬁcant progress. The
Allegheny County Health Depart-
ment said it did not know of any
such labeling policy coming to
Pittsburgh, and City Councilman
Doug Shields did not immediately
return a request for comment.

According to a 2003 study
in the journal Science, if a sig-
niﬁcant number of individuals
ingested 100 less calories per
day —— or expended 100 more
calories per day — weight loss
could be fast—tracked on a na-
tional level. According to a 2007
article published online in Forbes
magazine, Pittsburgh didn’t ap-
pear on the list of America’s 20
most obese cities, nor did Phila-
delphia. But there are plenty of
colleges in the Pittsburgh area,
and college students are noto-
rious for unhealthy diets and

' quick, on—the—go snacking and

meals. College can cause positive
lifestyle changes, even though it
seems most attendees are prone
to weight gain. Even if surprising
nutrition stats don’t sway every-
one, they expose hard numbers
that will inevitably result in some
healthier choices.

Columnist

I’ve written a great deal over the
past four months about the need
for greater transparency in Stu-
dent Government Board opera-
tions, and I’ve been pleased to also
document the progress made by
SGB President Charlie Shull to-
ward making SGB more open.

Indeed, SGB is becoming more
open every week, making changes
that excite me as well as other
student journalists involved in
campus media. But I’ve started
to question the extent to which
rank—and—ﬁle students are taking
advantage of this new transpar-
ency.

To ﬁnd out if students are pay-
ing attention, I asked a random
sample of 10 students a series
of four questions about SGB, the
source of SGB’s funds and the al-

locations process.

The questions are as follows:

1. Where does the money in
SGB’s budget come from? _

2. Do you know what the Stu-
dent Activity Fee is, and if so, how
much is it? I

3. Where do the proceeds from
the Student Activity Fee go?

4. Can you describe the alloca-
tions process?

Of the 10 students questioned,
seven did not know the answer to
question one, and nine could not
answer questions 2-4 correctly.
Although the questions might
seem unimportant to some read-
ers, these questions strike at the
heart of how both our student gov-
ernment and many of the clubs on
our campus are funded.

For instance, the answers to
questions 1-3 explain how SGB
is funded and where the money
it allocates to student groups
come from. SGB is tasked with
allocating more than half of the

'As‘SGB improves ways, don’t complain without attending meetings

$2,429,238 expected in revenue
from this academic year’s Student

Activity Fee, which is $80 per se-
’ mester. ‘ '

The nearly $2.5 million collect-
ed from the Student Activity Fee

’ is a signiﬁcant amount of money.
'To put it in perspective, the $160

yearly total paid by each student
amounts to about $25 more than
the proposed tuition tax would
have cost an in—state undergrad
at Pitt. ‘

More than being a lot of mon-
ey, the Student Activity Fee and
the allocations process play a
large role in determining the ac-
tivities of every club and student
organization on Pitt’s campus.
The speakers brought in by the
College Democrats and College
Republicans, the Playboy model
brought inby Pitt Program Coun-
cil last year and even the existence
of Telefact are all funded by the
Student Activity Fee.

cess no longer, takes place fully behind
closed doors, it’s especially possible for Pitt
students to inﬂuence it as long as they un-
derstand it. Disbursing a total of $1,276,715,
the allocations process involves the entire
SGB and the Allocations Committee in mak-
ing decisions on funding requests submit-
ted by student groups.

In short, the Student Activity Fee is a
lot of money, and the allocations process
constitutes an important part of our expe-
rience at Pitt. I

Moreover, as SGB becomes more trans-
parent and further reforms the allocations

process, students have unprecedented ac- -

cess to the decision-making process behind
allocations decisions and might even have
the ability to inﬂuence speciﬁc allocations
requests in the future. But all of these re-
forms mean nothing if students fail to make
use of them and educate themselves about
how our money is being spent. A

After all, The Pitt News cannot possibly
cover the minutiae of every meeting, and
students should not rely solely on cam-

pus media organizations to inform them
of SGB’s.spending. Stories fall through the
cracks and an allocations decision that
some students might ﬁnd important or of
interest might not make it into print.
Instead of relying on The Pitt News,
students should personally attend SGB’s
public meetings ~— held every Tuesday at
8:45  on the eighth ﬂoor of the Union
— and see for themselves how their money

. is being spent.

With the new transparency initiatives in
place, students have few excuses to com-

plain about SGB and instead have to start,

accepting responsibility themselves if the

Board makes unpopular decisions. If this '

year’s Board chooses to spend $60,000 on
ﬁberglass panther statues, we’ll all have
had plenty of time to take notice and stop
it only if rank-and—ﬁle students begin to
participate in SGB’s operations.

TELEVISION REVIEW I

Plenty of ‘Big Love’for HB

The fourth season of the polygamy drama brings same great performances with a change of pace

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

“Big Love” Season Four
Starring: Bill Paxton, Jeanne
Tripplehorn, Chloe Sevigny, Gin-
nifer Goodwin

Created by: Mark V. Olsen, Will
Scheffer

HBO

Sundays, 9 p.m.

Grade: A-

For Bill Henrickson and his
three wives, it is a season of
change in the small town of San-
dy, Utah —— a new family—owned
casino, a bid for Bill to run for
Utah state Senate and the passing
of the notorious Roman Grant (at
the hands of his son Alby, unbe-
knownst to everyone else).

And for viewers of the HBO
critical darling “Big Love,” the
change is for the better. Season
four of the show exempliﬁes ev-
erything there is to love about
“Big Love.” '

The season picks up right
where the season three ﬁnale

ANALYSIS

left’ off. Bill (Bill Paxton) and
his family are part of the newly
formed church following Barb’s
(Jeanne Tripplehorn) excommu-
nication fromjuniper Creek, and
their casino is about to open. The
discovery of Roman Grant’s death
affects everyone, especially his
daughter Nicki (Chloe Sevigny,
who won a Golden Globe for her
role), Bill’s second wife. Margene
(Ginnifer Goodwin) continues
to ﬁnd success with her home

shopping gig.

Four episodes have run so far, I

and while the major development
has been Bill’s bid to run for state
Senate, it is the small subplots
that really intrigue. Margene’s
relationship with Bill and Barb’s
son Ben continues to grow more
complicated, and the strain be-
tween Nicki and Bill remains
fascinating. A

If this all sounds confusing
because you haven’t followed the
series from the beginning, don’t
worry. One of the best things
about a season that is changing
so many things (including the
opening credits) is that it offers

Shopping is best as a solitaryexperience

Sam argues the beneﬁts of shopping alone rather than struggling through racks -with a group of friends

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

I can’t watch movies with other
people. At least movies that aren’t
“The Hangover” or “Miss Conge-
niality.” Any movie that’s even the
slightest bit more highbrow I have
to watch alone. If other people
are around, I can’t focus on what
I’m watching. I get obsessively
preoccupied with other people’s
reactions and worry about their
reactions to my reactions.

For example, if my fellow view-
er laughs at a mediocre line, then I
feel like I have to laugh so he or she
won’t feel stupid. I wish I could say

that this tendency is some grand
personality component that has to
do with validating other people’s
emotions, but it’s probably just
insecurity.

I much prefer watching movies
on my own. I can laugh when I feel
like it and get teary without feeling
awkward about it. I can get fully
absorbed into the mise—en—scénes
or whatever mumbo-jumbo ﬁlm
professors like to go on and on
about.

Similar to my movie-watching
tendencies are my habits as a con-
sumer. I can only go shopping by
myself.

Moseying around stores with
friends is fun and all —— especially

if you just want to drive sales as-
sociates crazy and browse your
way through an entire rack of sun-
glasses without any intention of
buying a pair — but when it comes
to hardcore shopping, I have to

A be alone. I

Trust me, you wouldn’t want to
be around when I have my sights
set on awardrobe overhaul.'It’s
not something you want to wit-
ness.

This is how my shopping expe-
rience goes: Step one is caf‘feina—
tion. The most integral part of the
shopping experience, a strong
cup of coffee is what separates
the shop-till-you-ﬁnd—it from the
check-one-store-and-leave.

So I get to the mall, my caffeine
buzz at full—throttle and head to
the stores I can’t afford. Looking
at $500 cardigans that don’t have
missing buttons and loose threads
reﬁnes my taste and makes it less
likely that I’ll buy a lot of crap later
on. I

Once I’ve successfully ended
my cravings for polyester blends,
I head to the budget retailers. This
is where it gets ugly. I’d like to take
this opportunity to apologize to
all sales associates who have ever
had to work in the ﬁtting room on
a day that I’ve entered their store.
I know, I’m a huge pain in the ass.
I’ve worked in retail and I am, in
fact, my own worst nightmare.

I head in and slowly comb my
way through the racks. I only pick
up what I’m instantly drawn to and
make commentary for everything
I see. “Are people really still wear-

" ing t-shirts that proclaim they love

their boyfriend? Who would buy I
anything that looks this cheap?

' This dress would make Kate Moss

look obese.” I get annoyed with
the obnoxiously giggly teenagers
and people who block the mirror
while I’m trying to decide if I can
pull off hats.

By the time I reach the back of
the store, I realize that I’m holding
four black t—shirt dresses and scold
myself for not thinking outside the
box. So I return to the front of the

High school freshman
gives children ‘Tips’

Sierra Starks
Senior Staff Writer

Previously considered to be an African-
American boy with an angry attitude and
aggressive tendencies, Pittsburgh native
Hassan Howze sat down and wrote a book,
defying all the stereotypes placed on him.

Howze, who is currently a freshman at
Pittsburgh’s City Charter High School, has
been through his share‘ of tough experiences.
Labeled a “bad” child, Howze found himself
frequently removed from summer camp and
other school programs. ‘

“There were a lot of people who gave
up on him when he was younger,” Howze’s
mother, Maisha Howze said. Instead of re-
sorting to medication or alternative schools,
Ms. Howze put faith in her son and refused
to give up on him as others had .

. Along with his mother, there was another
person who refused to just label Hassan as
“bad” and be done with him: Justin Laing,
Hassan’s'Capoeira instructor. Capoeira is an

beginning of the book, highlighting which
chores to attend to ﬁrst, among other advice.
After eight additional chapters of advice,
the book concludes with “Money Tips,”_ in
which Hassan simpliﬁes the task of manag-
ing money at a young age. This ten-chapter,
28—page how—to publication includes his
personal experiences and also brief letters
from peers seeking his guidance.

After answering their questions and hav-
ing his advice published for all to see, Hassan
doesn’t call himself an inspirational writer.
‘fMy book does inspire people that I’ve talked
to in the past, but I wouldn’t give myself that
title,” he said.

All the same, Hassan plans to write more
books in the future. His next project involves
everyone in his life, from past teachers and
classmates to more of his own family mem-
bers. The focus will be the journey to matu-
rity that he is currently taking. I

The conclusion of the journey presents
itself in Hassan’s “Life Tips.” In a society
where youths are seemingly unconcerned
about upstanding and moral ways to handle

cc

[Hassan] took everything that was inside of him
and he turned it around into something positive

Maisha Howze

Afro-Brazilian art involving music, dance
and martial arts. .

Recognizing Laing’s perseverance with
her son, Ms. Howze invited Laing, who
serves as a program ofﬁcer for the‘Heinz En-
dowment, to write the foreword to Howze’s
book, “Life Tips: Everything a Child Should
Know.” ~

“What [Laing] deposited into Hassan’s
life was discipline through Capoeira,” Ms.
Howze said. *

As well as never writing her son off with
a stereotype, “he always was also able to see

the positive in Hassan and see Hassan as a

potential leader,” she said. .

Highlightingvhis leadership abilities, La-
ing describes Hassan as»‘.‘extremely bright
and clearly ambitious.”

Over two years ago, Hassan found himself
in his house, bored. ‘

“I just sat down at the computer and
thought of things that happened in my life,”
he said. “And I just started typing.”

“Life Tips: Everything a Child Should
Know” is all that its title alludes to and more.
A section entitled “Parent Tips” marks the

situations, Hassan encourages them to “al-
ways do the right thing.”

Ms. Howze’s wish is that her son’s ad-
vice sticks with young people everywhere.
“I hope it serves ‘as an example that all of
our children aren’t doing negative things,”
she added. '

“[Hassan] took everything that was in-.
side of him and he turned it around into
something positive,” Ms. Howze explained.
Though she never reached the roots of her
son’s previous angry and aggressive demean-
or, she said, his progress has pleased her.. “I
think other children should recognize‘ [his

progress],” she said. “You don’t have to be .

the label that people put on you.” _
Hassan is already looking forward to his
future. He has his eyes set on Pitt for college
and plans to play basketball and additionally
to “study biology or something having to do

with the body.” He also has his own website S

in the works.

“Life Tips: Everything a Child Should
Know” is available for purchase by e-mail
through Hassan’s mother, Maisha Howze
at maitrinity@yahoo.com‘.

No sex or violence,
all you need is ‘Love’

Big Love 4 8

a chance for new viewers to getisucked
in even without an extensive previous
knowledge.

And it isivery hard not to get sucked in.
“Big Love” has one of the strongest casts
on television, with nearly every actor per-

forming at the top of their game. Goodwin ‘

is a delight, giving off a sweet demeanor
even with the traces of a painful history
behind her eyes, and Amanda Seyfried is
impeccable as Bill’s daughter Sarah.

It is Sevigny, however, who plays a role
so out of left field (she is Bill’s only wife
raised in the polygamist lifestyle) that few
other actresses could pull it off with the
same voracity and grace. Her Golden Globe
win for the show was well-deserved.

For many, “Big Love” remains a polar-
izing exercise in fascinating acceptance.
Focusing on the polygamist lifestyle of Bill,
his family and their fellow members of the
fundamentalist Mormon church, some ﬁnd
the depicted lifestyle too uncomfortable
to handle in a weekly serial dose. Also, the
lack of overtly profane, violent or sexual
content —— for the most part — may turn

off fans of other HBO fare such as “The
Sopranos” and “True Blood.” .

The latter, however, is part of what
makes the show such a thrill to invest
time in (and perhaps what makes it such
an award show favorite). To watch such
compelling and dramatic plot lines play
out without the frills of ﬂashy violence

or sex is an experience unmatched by any

other premium cable series. This isn’t to

say that the series is family friendly — in _

many ways, it is one of the most mature
shows on television. ‘

Still, like the Henrickson family it-
self, not everything is perfect. The Alby
Grant homosexuality subplot is tired and
awkward, as is Barb’s strained relation-
ship with the Native American casino co-
manager Tommy Flute. The series strains
through thin writing and forced perfor-
mances whenever these scenes occur.

Thankfully, these are the only criti-
cisms, and they are minor ones at that.
As it stands, season four will hopefully
be the season that brings plenty of love
to “Big Love.”

Despite 21 points from Shayla
Scott and 18 fromjania Sims, the
Pitt women’s basketball team fell
87-80 in overtime to the Syracuse
Orange last night.

In their second extra-period
game of the season, the Panthers
(12-9, 1-7 Big East) were unable
to come up with the same result
as their last trip to overtime. Pitt
defeated Austin Peay 76-75 in an
overtime game Dec. 20.

“Before we played South

Orange overcome

Florida [on Jan. 20], we talked
about how we had to go 8-4 to
ﬁnish out our season,” Scott said.
“Right now, we’re 1-3 from that
point. We needed this win just
to go of how we played against
Providence.” .

Pitt notched its first Big East
victory with a 72-58 win over
Providence onjan. 23.

The Panthers were out-scored
15-8 in overtime, with Vionca
Murray scoring the first five
Syracuse points of the period,
only broken up by a Scott layup
at the other end.

“Going into overtime, we
knew we had to carry over and
bring energy,” Sims said. “We
have to come out and play two
halves of basketball and we didn’t

do that.”

Pitt within one with a layup in
overtime, Nicole Michael hit a

jumper and Erica Morrow went .

Coming into the game, Pitt (16-5,
6-3 Big East) is trying to pull out of its
recent slump. The Panthers head to
Morgantown coming off a 70-61 loss
at South Florida and have lost three of
their last four games.

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon said the
team got away from its style of tough
defense and sound execution against
the Bulls.

“Numbers don’t lie,” Dixon said _

after the game. “We need to rebound
better. We need to defend better, and

’ we need to execute better.”

Ebanks stands sixth in the conference
with 8.2 rebounds per contest. ‘

Ebanks is one of four returning

team. Da’Sean Butler leads the veteran
group with 16.5 points per game, while
sophomore Kevinjones supplies 14.2
points per contest in his ﬁrst season
as astarter.

Butler and_Jones had 27 and 16
points, respectively, in West Virginia’s
come-ﬁ‘om—behind victory over Lou-
isville Saturday afternoon. The victory
helpedburnp the Mountaineers to sixth
in the AP Top 25 this week.

Meanwhile, for. the Panthers, Gil-

teams slump. Brown hadacareer-high

¢.3Both the men’s and women’s Pitt track and
ﬁeld teams had three people place in the
top ﬁve in various events when the Panthers
competed in the Penn State National Open
over the weekend.

Team scores weren’t tallied, but more
than 50 teams competed in the event, and
many Panthers on both teams qualiﬁed for
events later in the indoor season.

For the men, sophomore Dontave Cow- '

sette came in second place in the 800—me-
ter run with a time of 1:50.68. Meanwhile,
fellow sophomore Elliot Rhodes ﬁnished
eﬁourth in the 500-meter dash with a time of
1:04.60, qualifying him for the IC4A Cham-
pionships March 6-7 in Boston, an event
after the regular season that is the precursor
to the NCAA Indoor Championships.
Joining him in Boston will be Folarin
Ijelu and Garrett Larkin. Ijelu ﬁnished ﬁfth
in the triple jump, leaping a distance 15.02
meters. In the shot put, Larkin placed ninth
with a distance of 16.32 meters.
Also competing for the men were Teddy
Miller and Josh Christopher in the 5,000-
meter run. Miller ﬁnished 11th, while Chris-

18th in the 200-meter dash with a time of

22.67 seconds. .
For the women, junior Da’Lynn Mills

, ﬁnished third in the 200—meter dash with

a time of 24.24 seconds and Cambryajones
placed seventh with a time of 24.55. Mills
had already qualiﬁed for ECAC Champion-
ships March 6-7 in Boston, the women’s
equivalent of the IC4A Championships, at

the Kent State Golden Flash Gala Dec. 12.

Sophomore Miyajohnson came in third
in the 800-meter run with a time of 2:12.64,
and senior Kari Hedderick came in fourth in
the 500-meter dash with a time of 1:15.49.
Both earned a bid to the ECAC Champion-
ships. .. S

_ Qualifying for the Big East Indoor Cham-
pionships, Feb. 20-21 in New York, were
senior Kaetlyn Brown and junior Wunmi
Fapohunda. Brown ﬁnished 10th in the 400-
meter dash with a time of 57.38 seconds, and
Fapohunda ﬁnished 10th in the triple jump
with a distance of 11.45 meters.

Next, the Panthers travel to New York
this weekend for the New Balance Collegiate
Invitational starting on Friday where they’ll
take part in another meet with more than
50 other schools.

half, we had the opportunity, and we played
past it,” Berenato said. “You can’t play not
to lose. You haveto play to win.”

In the first four minutes of the second
half, the Panthers saw their 42-38 halftime
lead disappear.

“We felt like we were in command and
in charge [at halftime],” Berenato said.
“We didn’t carry over.”

A fast-break layup from Carmen Tyson-

Thomas gave the Orange its largest ad-

vantage of the second’ half at 55-50 with
12:59 remaining.

Brittaney Thomas nailed a key 2-point-
er to tie the game with 8:21 remaining.
Tyson-Thomas answered with a jumper,
but Scott gave Pitt the 64-63 lead with
a three.

A Chelsea Cole layup gave the Panthers
a 68-65 advantage, although she missed
the ensuing foul shot that would have put
the Orange in a four-point deﬁcit.

After Syracuse grabbed an early 4-2
advantage in the ﬁrst half, Pitt scored the
next 12 points, with Scott and Shawnice
“Pepper” Wilson scoring ﬁve points each
en route to building a 14-4 lead.

However, the Orange countered with
an 8-0 run of their own to cut the deﬁcit

With 6:40 remaining in the first half,
the game was tied at 27-27. That’s when
Thomas went on a 6-0 run of her own. She
hit two consecutive 3-pointersto give the
Panthers a six-point lead, and they didn’t
trail for the remainder of the half.

Pitt went into the half with a 42-38 lead,
its largest ﬁrst—half point total in Big East
play. Itwas only the third time in Big East
play that the Panthers scored 30 or more
points in the first half.

Berenato said that despite the los_s, the
game revealed solid statistics for the Pan-
thers that_ they haven’t seen in a long time,
including several girls in double ﬁgures.

Scott grabbed 10 rebounds to go
along with her 21 points, while Wilson
and Thomas added wand 14 points, re-
spectively.

However, the story of the game for the
Panthers ended up being turnovers once
again. Pitt turned the ball over 24 times,
resulting in 27 Syracuse points.

“You have to look at the stat sheet, and
it’s turnovers,” Berenato said. “That’s ball-
game.”

The Panthers return to the floor on
Saturday as they travel to South Bend, Ind.
to take on No. 3 Notre Dame.
