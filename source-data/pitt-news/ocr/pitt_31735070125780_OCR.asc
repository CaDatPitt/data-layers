A Cathedral of Learning lawn.

— Pitt Program Council organized
and staged the pep rally to excite
fans for today’s football game
against Miami. The rally featured
appearances by the Pitt band, cheer-
leaders, dance team, football team
and numerous speakers.

Gasps, shrieks and cheers of
“Let’s go Pitt” resounded through-
out the crowd as fireworks ﬂew

appeared to be ecstatic at the event,

“There should be more student‘

In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks on New

his speech. Bush also made it clear thatthe new
office would need to formulate a response to ter-
rorist attacks, as well as work to prevent them.

“Beyond that,” Ridge said in a statement that
night, “all I know is that I have a lot of work to
do.” '

Ridge is a prominent fig-
ure in the Republican Party,
having been considered as a

1996 presidential campaign and
by Bushin his 2000» campaign.

After Bush’s election,
Ridge’s name came up repeated-
ly in discussion of potential
cabinet members, but was again
passed over, reputedly because
of his moderate stance on abor-
tion. . 5

Distinguished members of
both the Republican and
Democratic parties praised and
supported Bush’s appointment

of Ridge. Among his supporters are Democratic
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Senate Majority Whip
Harry M. Reid (D) and House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt (D), three of the most inﬂuen-
tial members of the Democratic Party.

Before -becoming governor, Ridge. served as
the assistant district attorney for Erie County.
From 1983 to 1985, he was. a member of the U.S.

He is perhaps most noted for his tough stance
on crime. Since his election, Ridge instituted a
three strikes policy to punish and discourage
repeat offenders. He also passed legislation
streamlining the process of carrying out the death
penalty. Ridge signed more than 200 execution

American Flag tattoos

ERIN WALSH
The Pitt News

Shortly before noon on a brisk_

autumn day, a crowd lines up outside
of South Side Tattoo, waiting for the
shop to open.

A young man wearing glasses
peers into the storefront window
adorned with a celestial painting.
Ken Betonte, a 25-year-goldresident
of Avalon, says he read about a spe-
cial being offered in the newspaper.
“I already have a tattoo of a lizard on
my calf,” he says, hiking up his pant
leg. “I was thinking
of getting a tattoo. of
an American ﬂag
already, and the
events just triggered
this,” Betonte said.

Betonte and the
others outside the
shop are waiting to
get American ﬂag
tattoos to commemo-
rate the events of
Sept. 11. In light of

South Side Tattoo,
located at 2210 East
Carson St., decided
to offer a one-week
special where customers can get a
free tattoo of an American ﬂag.

A tanned, blond woman opens
the door at noon and the group,
which has now reached 12, files
inside. Overhead fans circulate air
through the spacious front roomgln
the middle of the room is a- small
structure of two pre-Raphaelite chil-
dren, surrounded by, binders that
contain tattoo designs, categorically
divided into groups including
women, Celtic designs and dragons.

The patrons form a haphazard

line running from the door to the -

front desk. A man in a ﬂannel shirt
wearing a Penguins baseball cap
casually ﬂips through a design
binder. A golden-haired toddler doo-
dles on an Etch-a-Sketch in a chair
next to her mother, as her father
looks back at them -from the slow-
moving line. "

The crowd around the desk
thickens, where a sign reads,
“Donations Encouraged,” and “In
Memory of the Fallen Firefighters.”

Owner Veronica Delaney works
on a woman that already has a black
rose tattooed on her bicep and a
Chinese symbol for love on her
wrist.

“Ever since the tragedy
occurred, we’ve been thinking of

South Side
Tattoo is
oﬁering free
ﬂag tattoos  
through ,
tomorrow.

some way to do our part,” Delaney
said. “This is what we’ve come up

with and people can make dona- _

tions.”

Delaney estimates that since
Monday, the shop’ has collected
about $400 for the Emergency Relief
Fund and has given 100 ﬂag tattoos.
The l2‘designs being offered, rang-
ing in style from a traditional ﬂag to
a flag with an eagle’s head, would

typically cost about $120 according ’

to Delaney.
“We’ve had a lot of requests for
ﬂags over the past few weeks, but a
lot of people could-
n’t afford them.
That’s another rea-
son we decided to do
them for free,”
Delaney said.
Delaney noted that
the patrons“ -have
been quite diverse,
ranging from 18- to
70-year-olds.
“We’ve seen
‘a lot of Vietnam vet-
erans and lots of

women,” she said.
“As many women as
-men.”

the overwhelming demand ‘ for the
tattoos, Delaney has extended the
promotion for an extra week at her
other shop, Island Avenue Tattoo,

located in McKees Rocks. “We’vef

probably done 20 tattoos a day since
Monday,” she said. “We’re'already
booked through next week. I’ve been
coming in an hour early to fit in
extra appointments,” she said.

_ At 1 p.m. the crowd begins to

‘thin out, though a steady spattering

of customers continues to meander
through the door. A good-natured
fellow wearing a pumpkin-colored

shirt and khakis Walks through the '

door with a friend wearing a back-
ward baseball cap.

Chris Beck, a 2_l-year-old
Duquesne student, is 1-: considering
getting a‘ ﬂag tattoo. “I just found
out about this an hour ago -and I
thought about getting one on my

arm, in light of the events,” he said, _
“I’m also looking to cover up one I ’

already have and red and blue would,
work — it needs to be at least red.”

Beck said that the tattoos are a l_

good way to show patriotism.

“Times like this are the only times 1

when people ﬂy their ﬂags and show

patriotism. Then they will put them.

away. I would rather always show a
sign" of my patriotism.”

Iran will not support U.S.
coalition against terrorism

JOHN WARD ANDERSON &- KAMRAN KHAN
The Washington Post

ISTANBUL, Turkey — Iran’s top
political and religious
Wednesday said his country would not

join a U.S.-led coalition against terror- .

ism, dousing hopes that Iran’s recent
condemnations of terrorist attacks in
the United States might lead to ‘warm-
ing relations between the longtime
antagonists.

Sincere messages of sympathy and
denunciations of terrorism from
Iranian officials following the Sept. 11
attacks in New York and Washington
led some analysts to suggest that there
was potential for repairing relations
that have been hostile for morethan
two decades, since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution. A

But in a speech excerpted on
national television, Iran’s 1 Supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said
that the United States was “not sincere
enough to lead an international move
against terrorism” because of its con-
tinued support for Israel. He added,

“Iran will provide no help to America I

and its allies  in an attack on suffer-
ing, neighboring, Muslim
Afghanistan.” .

The United States is attempting to
build a broad international coalition
that would support strikes against an
alleged terrorist organization headed
by ﬁigitive Saudi millionaire Osama
bin Laden, the leading suspect in ter-
rorist attacks two weeks ago that left
about 6,500 people dead or missing.
Bin Laden is being sheltered in
Afghanistan by the Taliban, a radical
Islamic militia that controls most of the
country.

Thousands of demonstrators in
Kabul, the Afghan capital,‘ sacked the
long-abandoned U.S. Embassy
Wednesday, setting ﬁve cars ablaze,
ripping down the U.S. seal above the
front entrance and burning American

ﬂags and an effigy of President Bush‘

while chanting “Longlive Osama!” the

tAssociated Press reported from the

city. The embassy compound, protect-
ed by a few Afghan security guards,
has been abandoned since 1989.
Reﬂecting heightened concerns
about security, the United‘ States
Wednesday closed its consulate in
Pakistan’s second-largest city, Lahore.
Families of U.S. diplomats posted in
Pakistan have already left the country.
In Pakistan’s business capital and
largest city, Karachi, a demonstration
by about 15,000 people in favor of
joining a U.S.-led anti-terrorism coali-
tion was disrupted by a grenade attack
that injured at least 12 people. Most

leader '

recent demonstrations in Pakistan have
been called by Islamic groups to
protest the country’s decision to help
the United States track down bin Laden
and persuade the Taliban to hand him
over for prosecution.

In Islamabad, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Riaz Mohammad Khan
reﬂected‘ the country’s sensitive politi-
cal balancing act, telling reporters that
while Pakistan supported the drive
against terrorism, it would never par-
ticipate in any hostile action against
Afghanistan. 2 -

“We are deeply conscious that the

destinies of the two people and_ two.

countries are intertwined,” hesaid.

The statement Wednesday by
Iran’s supreme leader added to the con-
ﬂicting signals being sent by that coun-
try’s bifurcated government about its
position concerning an international
anti-terrorism coalition and any retalia-
tion against bin Laden or Afghanistan
led by the United States, which has
branded Iran as a supporter of terror-
ism. '

Reformists in Iran’s elected gov-
ernment, led by moderate reformist
President Mohammad Khatami, would
like the international respectability and
ﬁnancial assistance that better relations
with the United States would bring.
But the appointed religious hierarchy,
led by Khamenei and dominated by
hard-liners who take their cue from
him, still bristle at the thought of coop-

erating on anything with the United

States, which they see as leading
attacks against Islam around the globe.
While Khamenei seemed to be

issuing a preemptive criticism of any I

U.S. actions against Afghanistan,
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi told
reporters that if the United States could
prove who was behind the Sept. 11
attacks, it had the right to respond.

“If it becomes clear'which particu-

. lar group carried out these attacks in

the United States, naturally the United
States, based in the [United Nations]
charter, can take action,” he said,
according to the official. state news
agency, IRNA. .

Khamenei, however, is the highest-
ranking official in Iran, and under the
country’s constitution his pronounce-
ments and decisions are ﬁnal. Just as
importantly, his conservative, religious
side of the government controls Iran’s
military and its intelligence agencies,
which would be integral to any cooper-
ation with the West; '~ I

His speech, delivered to a group of

‘war veterans and their families, was

punctuated by chants from the crowd

president said, “Every nation in every

region now has a decision to make{

“It is not that anyone who is with

America so hated in the world.”
Khamenei’s remarks. came a day
after an upbeat visit to Iran by British
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, the high-

New Schenley visitor center to take Pitt funds

« LAUREN BAN
The Pitt News

The new Schenley Park Visitor
Center across the street from Phipps
Conservatory is scheduled to open
in ‘November, and will soon play
host to Pitt students and other visi-
tors looking for someplace to eat,
drink and learn about the park.

Pitt students will be able to use
their Pitt funds at the center, which
will be open every day, to enjoy a
cup of coffee or a small lunch.
Students will have the opportunity
to partake in activities such as

  
 
   
  

nature classes, nature photography
and walks and hikes throughout the
park.

“I think Pitt students will find
this a really comfortable place to
relax and study,” said Abbie Pauley,
who is the director of public educa-
tion and programs at the Pittsburgh
Parks Conservancy. ‘

“Our goal is to get people excit-
ed about the park,” Pauley said.
“We hope that the visitor center will
give people the. sense that someone

.is at home at Schen1ey.”

The center will feature an infor-
mation kiosk, which will highlight

park events and will also serve as a
staringpoint for walks and hikes. A
computer will map out individual
trails based on what people punch
into the computer and the type of
walk they want to take. ,

“We hope that people will be
inspired to take a- walk in Schenley,

and this feature should definitely»

help,” Pauley said.
Interpretive exhibits that aim ‘to

explain the park’s history and lay- .

out will also be included in the cen-
ter.

Coach Harris vows to

‘battle our butts off’  

Bonﬁre, page 1

‘ The Pitt cheerleaders and dance
team displayed their skills onstage
with several spirited dances as stu-
dents gathered. The rally began
with a video from PPC showing the
Cathedral and some of the diverse
faces of Pitt to the sounds of
“America the Beautiful.”

Groups of students proudly sang
along, striking a warm _chord of
patriotism throughout the crowd.
Several brief speeches followed, the
first a welcome speech by the head
of the alumni association, Sam
Zachariahs.

‘ “Let’s ' beat the Miami
Hurricanes and hail to Pitt,”
Zachariahs said. KDKA sportscast—
er Paul Alexander spoke next, intro-
ducing the 200l Pitt dance team.

“Isn’t it nice it’s a little coldfor
Miami?” Alexander quipped to the
cheers of students.

Two more video clips followed,
’ theme
“Remembering the Times of Our
Lives.” This video featured clips of
‘each sport Pitt offers, andclips of
the cheerleading and dance squads
andthe Pitt band from last year. The
video concluded with the message
“Always believe in yourself, always

.duced

believe in your friends, always
believe in the Panthers” to tune of
Green Day’s “Good Riddance.”

Alexander then read some of
last year’s impressive sports statis-
tics and announced the 12th Man
student captain for tonight’s game
as the crowd grew more and more
anxious for the lighting of the fire.

To the delight» of screaming
female fans, one last video clip,
entitled .“Air Operations Center,”
was shown. This video featured
members of the football team as air
force "pilots and soldiers, then
revealed their true identities by
showing clips of past Pitt games.

Head coach Walt Harris intro—
senior player’ Brandon
Williams, who spoke about his own
experience and desire to win. Harris
then spoke briefly, assuring fans,
“We’re gonnabattle our butts off,”
but that their help is needed;

The Pitt football team then _

processed to the stage after being
called by Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg. Nordenberg beckoned
fans to “help us bring the heat,”
quoting the phrase seen on the
numerous Bonfire ’0l T-shirts. The
pep rally concluded with the excite-
ment and warmth of the fire and
collective spirit of the fans present.

Lt. Gov. Schweiker takes the reins

Ridge, page 1

- warrants since coming into office.

In 1996, he passed into law a
welfare reform plan, mandating that
welfare recipients must look for
work immediately upon receiving
benefits, and must work at least 20
hours a week within two years of
entering the welfare program.

Ridge has also made strides to
clean up pollution in Pennsylvania.
He was one of the leaders of a suc-
cessful 2000 campaign in federal
_court to require other states to

reduce emissions coming into the.

state.
Before the campaign, . out-of-
state pollution was responsible for

one—third of all of Pennsylvania’s air

pollution.
According to Department of

,Environmental Protection Secretary

James R. Seif, “Pennsylvania has
reduced ozone—causing pollution
from power plants and factories
[within its borders] by two—thirds
since l995,” when Ridge took office

as gOVC1‘fl0I'.'

Of his successor Schweiker,"

Ridge said, “No lieutenant governor

in Pennsylvania history ha_s played a

more substantive role in an adminis-
tration. And he will do an outstand-
ing job as governor.” '

Schweiker» expressed similar
confidence, predicting a‘ “smooth
transition” when Ridge cleaves office
next week;

Robert Jubelirer, the state senate
president pro—tempore, who will
become lieutenant governor under
Schweiker, said of the future gover-
nor, “I’m sure he’ll have ideas of his
own, but I think he’ll continue the
initiatives of the Ridge—Schweiker
administration.”

Schweikersaid last year that he
would not campaign to replace
Ridge when his term ended in 2003,
and last week said, “I don’t see
myself changing my mind.”

Last ‘month, Schweiker joined‘

Ridge in supporting state Attorney
General Mike Fisher in his bid for
the governor’s office.

Hurricanes good cause for insanity

Ever wanted to go wild on national
television?

Well, here’s your chance. Tonight, the
Pittsburgh Panthers face the 
Hurricanes at Heinz Field._

Four years ago, the Panthers upset the
Hunicanes 21-17 in a Thursday night game
at Pitt Stadium.

That night, campus went wild. A mob
of students rushed the ﬁeld, tore down the
goalpost and tossed it over the tall end of
Pitt Stadium. 0

Except for games against Penn State,

we haven’t seen that kind of school spirit -

since. Tonight is the time to change that.

ESPN will broadcast the game live
nationwide. Our last game made national
headlines — because South Florida had only
beaten one other Division I-A team — so
tonight is our chance for redemption.’

It is our hope that the upset three weeks
ago will help the Panthers begin anew. Even
if they don’t beat the N o. 1 Hurricanes, they
could at least show a respectable perfor-
mance. After our humiliation against South
Florida, we still got four votes in the
ESPN/U SA Today ‘poll. After tonight, those
votes will either grow or vanish.

But the Panthers can’t do it without the
12th Man.

How many schools get to be on nation-
al television on a Thursday night? Tonight
is our chance to show how enthused Pitt
studentsreally are. .

Get wild on campus before the game.
Get wild on the buses. Get wild in the sta-

dium. .

Whenever the camera focuses on the
student section, viewers from Anchorage to
Miami should see a rowdy crowd. They
should see no one sitting. They should see
students yelling and cheering for their
Panthers. They should see signs all over.

The stadium should be so loud that the
folks at home can hear us better than they
hear the commentators. They should also
hear us chanting whatever we want — who
cares what the administration says or what
the band plays.

This is possibly the event of the semes-
ter at Pitt. It’s a Thursday night game. It’s
against the No. 1 team in the country.

And the game is going to have a patri-
otic pre-game show. Lee Greenwood will
sing his most famous song, “God Bless the
U.S.A. (Proud to Be an American),” and
We’re going to have the world’s biggest
American ﬂag on the ﬁeld again. ,

We have no excuse not to be there.
Many professors have cancelled classes and
even tests. -

And tonightwill-be a great timeto s
some glory of Pitt past. We’re retiring Mark
May’s number, and anyone else with that
honor — including Mike Ditka and Dan
Marino — will be there.

I.et’s show the country that We’re not
apathetic. Let’s go wild on national televi-
sion. *

And who knows, maybe when it’s all
over we’ll have blown away the
Hurricanes.

Elizabeth Bowen
Managing Editor

Now We’re all scrambling to

our homes, our bikes, our
bodies. Subtle pins have
replaced the gaudy earrings
of yesteryear, but the idea is

time of crisis, and we want
to support it.

Owning a ﬂag gives me
a sense of unity with other
Americans. I feel especially

 

apparent even after I learned

the Pledge of Allegiance. In Girl Scout
camp I was bewildered by the pomp and
circumstance that accompanied the rais-
ing of the ﬂag at the start of the day and
the lowering of it in the evening. .

My sisters and I had a few of those
miniatureﬂags that you get at Memorial
Day parades. I enjoyed using them as
apparatuses for pole-vaulting in my
Barbie Olympics.

The flag took on a new meaning
during the Persian Gulf War, when I was
in fifth grade. “Proud to Be an
American” played about 10 times a day
on ‘the radio.’ People wore T-shirts
declaring their American pride. I had
ﬂag earrings. Patriotism had become a
packageable commodity, and I was more
than willing to chipin my allowance. To
me, the ﬂag was more a fashion acces-
sory than a symbol of my country’s her-
itage. ‘

During high school the ﬂag faded
into virtual oblivion, and nearly all
traces of patriotism evaporated from my
heart. My homeroom teacher allowed us
to watch “Gilligan’s Island” for a few
minutes each morning instead of recit-
ing the pledge. I was self—centered and
happy. My pride was vested primarily in

picked up a ﬂag from Soldiers’ and

Sailors’ _Memorial the other week, and '

set it on the ground almost immediately
while I adjusted my backpack, not real-
izing for a few seconds the transgression
I had committed. ,

Last week my father and I were eat-
ing lunch in the Strip District, and we
stopped in one of the toy stores and
bought a few miniature ﬂags. I took
some home with me, planning to place

them on my cubicle at work. But that-

evening, my dad called, and kindly but
firmly offered me a suggestion: He
thought I should give a ﬂag to my neigh-

’ bors across the street, at Salem’s Halal

Meat and Groceries.

I have lived across the street from
Salem’s for more than a year now. Last
semester I wrote a piece about the shop

An open letter to
Chancellor Nordenberg

Tonight is the start of the Jewish

‘holiday Yom Kippur. The holiday

begins at sundown, around 7 p.m.
tonight, and ends at sundown, again
around 7 p.m., tomorrow night.
Yom Kippur is the holiest and
most solemn day of the Jewish year.
Qn Yom Kippur, Jews fast for 25
hours and repent to God to forgive
us of our sins we committed over the
last year. We fast in order to show
how sorry we are for committing
these sins. We also don’t watch tele-
vision, write or do any other kind of

I work throughout the 25 hours.

This ensures Jewish people that
they are strictly thinking about
repenting to God. Tonight at 7,
while I will be praying in syna-
gogue, the University has scheduled
its annual bonfire. Why tonight? I
am a sophomore at Pitt and I greatly
enjoyed going to the bonfire last
year. I really had a lot of fun. This
year I’m unable to attend because of
my religion. I don’t understand why
the bonfire isn’t on homecoming
week.

Also, it’s unfortunate that
Jewish people have to miss classes
on Thursday. And, for me personal-
1y, I have to break my fast early for
the Pitt football game Thursday
night.

I announce football games on
WPTS-FM. This game is my time to
shine and announce a game for the
No. 1 team in the country. There are

more than 3,000 Jewish students at

the University of Pittsburgh, and
many more Jewish alumni. For all
Jewish people, it is not considerate
of the NCAA and Pitt to make a
bonfire or a football game on the
holiest day of the Jewish year.

I’m aware that there isn’t any-
thing that can be done for tonight’s
bonfire and tomorrow’s game, but
since I am only a sophomore, I
would like to see this never happen
again. Thank you.

Editor’s note: This note was submit-
ted to The Pitt News yesterday, in
present tense. Also, the spelling G-d
is in the original copy.

Venting rage

I wanted to beat the crap out of
the people who crashed into the
World Trade Center and the
Pentagon. I also want to beat the
crap out of the people who have

‘been harassing students of other

nationalities and races.

Any form of racism makes me"

angry beyond words._ I am a white
man. I don’t normally feel the brunt
of racism or prejudices, but I do
know what it feels like. At one time
or another, everyone has been
judged by his or her skin color or his
or .her appearance by mistake or
fool’s ignorance. _

But I still can’t understand it!
We are all Americans and human

beings. Anyone who blames all
Arabs for the events on Sept. .11
betrays us all. I thought we
Americans had learned that some-
one’s appearance doesn’t, dictate
who they are. I thought we

Americans knew that the color of’

one’s skin or the religion one prays
for doesn’t spell their allegiances.

I feel personally hurt and
betrayed when I hear of the harass-
ing that takes place. I want to find
someone harassing an Indian or
Middle Eastern person or anyone.
I’ll show the ignorant bastard what
being an American really means.

I have never been so full of emo-
tion, especially fury, as I am today.

Is it wrong to be -intolerant of
intolerant people? Is it wrong to hate
people who hate others? I know I
will be doing penance for this, but I
say now that I challenge anyone
who puts down a fellow American
citizen because of his race. I may
not be the biggest fellow in the
world, but heaven help anyone who
stands in my way. '

Column shows hypocrisy

There waslone question I had to
ask myself on Friday afternoon after
reading The Pitt News: If left—wing
leaders like Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and House

V Minority Leader Richard Gephardt

(D—Mo.) can stand behind the presi-
dent, why can’t a certain Pitt News

 

columnist?

I was enraged after reading
David Chung’s editorial entitled
“Americans Fail to Comprehend
Motives Behind Attack” that stated
the American people were “igno-
rant” for thinking Osama bin Laden
is, if not totally behind this act,
somewhat involved. Some of the
greatest political minds in America
believe he is as well.

I couldn’t help but laugh at the
hypocrisy when the writer com-
plained that the media and the
American people were unjustly pin-
ning the attacks on bin Laden but
then went on to degrade George W.
Bush for saying “Freedom itself was
attacked by a faceless coward.”

Personally, I don’t care what the
terrorists’ motives were or that we
fail to comprehend them, the fact is
our country lost thousands of inno-
cent people to an indescribable act
of hate. I will not sit here and try to
rationalize why the terrorists did
this and I will not pretend like this is
OK because it happens everyday in
other areas of the world. There is

, nothing wrong with a little showing

of national pride at times like these.

, The country needs to unite to
take a stand against terrorism or else
no one is safe. The president knows
it, the Congress knows it and the
world knows it. Now if we could
only get the columnist in question to
drop his calculator and lend a hand,
we might be able to get through this

. tragedy with a little more ease.

Simple gesture seals

Bowen, page 8 awkward. But my dad urged me to put
aside my reservations and be a good
neighbor.

So, ﬂag in hand, I went to the shop
one morning, with the ulterior motive of
purchasing some Basmati rice. A few of
the other employees who I know were
there, and we talked while I scarmed the
shelves, looking for the rice. The shop
appeared to be out.

When Salem emerged from the back
of the store I shyly offered him the ﬂag.
We both smiled, and he accepted it. The
moment was not particularly emotional
or climactic; it was just a simple interac-
tion between two neighbors.

Afﬁrrning that he was did not have
any bags of rice left to sell, Salem pro-
ceeded to ask Nabil, the cook, to get me
some from the kitchen. Nabil opened ‘a

In many respects Salem and I could

Christian vegetarian college student. But
we always found things to talk about.
Often he offered me green tea and
baklavas, and he taught me about Islam
and meat and what it means to be a truly
generous person.

Still, I felt a little funny about going
over to his shop and offering him a ﬂag.
I had no idea how Salem and his family
had been affected by the terrorist attack.
I worried that they might feel patronized
by this gesture, or that it might just be

_ Nothing earth-shattering happened
in Salem’s shop that morning. Peace on

peace and patriotism, so happy that I live
in a country where I can care and be
cared for by my neighbors, despite the
differences in our religions, our native
tongues, our colors of our skin.

The No.1-ranked Miami
Hurricanes (2-0 overall, 2-0 Big
East) storm into Heinz Field tonight
to take on the Panthers (1-1, 0-0).

Both teams last saw action Sept.
8 because of games canceled fol-
lowing the tragedy. Miami’s last
game was a 61 -0 pounding of
Rutgers in which the Hurricanes
rushed for 227 yards and passed for
315 yards. Pitt was upset by South
Florida 35-25 in its last outing.

Pitt and Miami have met 28
times in the past, their first matchup
dating back to 1950. The
Hurricanes lead the series 18-9-1,
with the last Pitt victory coming in
1997 with a 21-17 upset at Pitt
Stadium. Miami has outscored the
Panthers 731-349.

The University of Miami has a lustrous his-
tory when it comes to its football program.

National championships in 1983, 1987, 198-9 and’

1991 just skim the top of the 75—year—oldbarrel
when it comes to the Hurricanes’ success onthe

nation. “

The Hurricanes also boast 58 All—Americans,
dating back to 1950. Names such as George

' Mira, Ray Lewis and Ted Hendricks stand out

along with players. like Testaverde, Sapp,
Morgan and Torretta on the school’s list of col-
lege greats. . . 

Miami has had 38. players go?-in the ‘ first

Timefor Pitt fans to letloose and go wild

Are you ready for some foot-
ball?

For whichever reasons, I’m
pretty excited about tonight’s
matchup against Miami. Maybe it’s
because we have gone'l9 days with-
out Pitt football. Maybe it’s because
we’re playing the best team in the
country. _

Maybe it’s just the simple
fact that it’s going to be fun.

I don’t know if anyone else has
noticed, but the student body seems
to be energized by the anticipation
of tonight’s game. Everyone seems
to be scrambling for a ticket or
planning tailgating activities.

And it’s about time.

Pitt kicks off its Big East sched-
ule after playing East Tennessee
State and South Florida, two teams

no one cared much about. But with ‘

the layoff between games, it feels
almost like the beginning of a new
season, and for the Panthers, that’s
very well what it could be.

I’m not saying Pitt is going to
go out there and win, but it’s a pos-
sibility, and they definitely can play
a close game.

And without a doubt, the fans
can be a factor.

We need to go out there and
show a national television audience

that we are the best fans in college
football.

We need to be loud, cheering,
chanting and even yelling out “P-E-
N—N-S-T SUCKS!” Who cares that
the University does not want us_ say-
ing it, and that some students think
it’s stupid? It’s a Pitt

claws.

Everyone seems ready for what
could be the most memorable game
of the season. We’ve even been
blessed with frigid temperatures -—
perfect football weather.

I’m sick of hearing

tradition and we can
yell it if we want.

We need to stand,
even if ushers tell us to
sit down. Since when do
people sit quietly in
chairs to watch a game?

- This is football, not

We need to make
signs, wave -pompoms
and proudly‘ wear our

I’ve been bubbling with Pitt

It’s true that the University
makes it tough for students to attend
soccer games by making the teams
play all the way out in the middle of
nowhere.

But it is now offering bussing to
two games, and students should take
advantage.

Cross country, volleyball and
tennis are also going on now, and
those teams need and deserve just as
much support as the football team.

But in addition, there is a wide
variety of sports here at Pitt that
many students might not know
about. i

For instance, I was ' just
informed the other day that Pitt has
a bowling team. That’s_right, a
bowling team. I never knew that and
I doubtmany other students did
either.

There’s also rugby, ultimate

_ Frisbee, and men’s and women’s ice

hockey. The list goes on.

I’ll admit that I’m ignorant to
many of the club sports here at Pitt,
just as other students may be. But as
I’m learning more about them, I’m
definitely intrigued and plan on
checking some of them out.

But for now that plan is on hold,
because tonight I will be at a game
that will show the nation what col-
lege football is all about. Proudly
display your blue and gold, make
some noise and live it up. This is
our school, our team, and we’re
going to rock the place.

So let’s go Pitt!

Forward Mark Sikora had the only shot in the game for the Panthers, who wer
shut down by the UConn defense last night. i

UConn slips by men’s

soccer on late goal  

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff ‘Writer '

Troubles continue for the men’s
soccer team, whose. losing and score-
less streak now stands at five games
after a 1-0 shutout against the
Connecticut Huskies at Morrone
Stadium in Storrs, Conn., last night.

The game remained grid locked
at a scoreless tie until late when
UConn’s David Castellanos put the
one and only goal of the night past
Pitt goalkeeper Justin Gaul.

The goal came at the 84:05 mark
when Castellanos sent the ball into
the bottom left corner of the net from
28 yards out. His goal was unassist-
ed.

UConn outshot Pitt 17-1 on the
game with six of those shots coming
in the first period and 11 in the sec-
ond. The UConn goalkeeper,
Bryheem Hancock, didn’t have any
saves because of the efforts of the
Husky defensive backﬁeld. Damani
Ralph led UConn with six shots.
Chris Gbandi, Lindon Pecorelli and
Ian Quattrocchi also had shots on

goal to go along with Castellanos’
score.

Mark Sikora registered . Pitt’s
only shot in the second period, but it
wasn’t a shot on goal. The defense
kept the Huskies out of striking dis-
tance for most of the game with only
four of the 17 shots being on goal.
Gaul had three saves.

UConn had eight comer kicks to
Pitt’s zero. Pitt had 13 fouls to
UConn’s 10, with Marco Carrizales
getting a yellow card for the Panthers

at the 54:12 mark.

The Panthers were also defeated
1-0 last season in the team’s only
matchup with the Huskies, a season
in which Pitt went 13-5.

UConn’s record is now 2-0-0 in

the Big East and 4-2-2 overall. It
plays the University of Hartford on

A Saturday at home.

' With the loss, Pitt’s record drops
to 0-4-0 in Big East play and 1-6-0
overall. Pitt" hasn’t won or scored
since beating St. Francis (Pa.) 3-0 on
Sept. 5. The team will return home to
take on St. Bonaventure on Sunday at

Coker predicts Bryant will be in Pittlineup

KAREN BIEL’AK
~ Assistant Sports Editor

The focus of Big East football
this weekend will be on tonight’_s
matchup between Pitt and the No. 1
Miami Hurricanes. Each team has
gone 19 days since it’s last contest,
and is ready to get back into action.

“It’s very good to see college
football going again this weekend,”
said Miami head coach Larry Coker
during the weekly Big East coaches
teleconference. “We’re very excited
about the opportunity to get back on
the field.”

While admitting that the long
span without a game is a concern,
Coker is not offering it as an
excuse. He has triedto vary practice
in order to keep his team focused.

Coker also commented on his
respect for the Pitt team and said it
will be a difficult challenge for
Miami even though they have had
success against the Panthers in the
past.

But Coker also remembers a
Thursday night in 1997.

“They beat us a few years ago in
Pittsburgh,” Coker said. “They have
a lot of good players returning and
had a lot of quarterback sacks last
year.”

The main question remains of
whether or not Antonio Bryant will
be in the lineup for Pitt. The
Hurricanes expect Bryant to play
and have been preparing for the sit-
uation. ~ .

» “As the awards will show you,
he’s probably the best player inthe
league at that position,” Coker said.

He was quick to say that the

“Maryland has always been a

said. “It’s going to be a little more

Beamer said. “We’re going through

we’ll get better.”

The Hokies will look toward
hosting Central Florida on Saturday,
a game Beamer considers to be— a

But head coach Paul.Pasqualoni

Pasqualoni also mentioned that

Defensive backs Torrie Cox,
Shawntae Spencer, Ponko, Corey
Humphries and Ramon Walker will
share the responsibility of contain-

ing the Hurricanes receivers.

Defensively, Miami has given
up 146 yards rushing and 303 yards
passing. They have come up with
five sacks for a loss of 41 yards.
Pursuing Pitt quarterback David
Priestley, who is 43 of 65 with 488

yards passing and has thrown. four‘
touchdowns, will be defensive ends.

Cornelius Green and 4 Jerome
McDougle, and defensive tackles
William Joseph and Matt Walters.
Joseph and Walters each have one
of Miami’s five sacks.

The Hurricanes front four along
with linebackers Chris Campbell,
Jonathan Vilma and D.J. Williams

will attempt to shut down Pitt run-
ning back Raymond Kirkley, who
rushed for 9 yards on 10 attempts

against South _Florida. Williams is

the Hurricanes leading tackler with
15 total tackles.

Wide receiver Antonio Bryant is
questionable, so the focus may shift
to R.J. English, who has 10 catches,
212 yards and three touchdowns on
the season. Lamar Slade is also a
target along with Yogi Roth, who
has been filling in for Bryant.

Cornerbacks Mike Rumph and
Phillip Buchanon look to blanket
Pitt’s receivers with assistance from
safeties Edward Reed and James
Lewis. The Hurricanes have picked
off three passes this year — Reed
and Lewis have one apiece.

Kickoff tonight is at 7:30 at
Heinz Field, and the game will be
televised on ESPN.

“It’s bigger than just this week
or’ this season,” Schiano said.
“We’re building a programand our
freshmen are playing because they
give us the best chance of winning.”

Rutgers will host Connecticut
‘on Saturday night, and while it may
not be as challenging a game as the
last two matchups with the Hokies
and Hurricanes, the Scarlet Knights
are not taking it lightly. ‘

“I don’t think the opponent has
anything to do with how we per-
:form,”- Schiano said. “This is a
young team trying to get better and
they are truly concerned just with
themselves.”

'The . -Eagles continue their
schedule against military opponents

when they host Army this Saturday
after defeating Navy 38-21 last
weekend. Head coach Tom O’Brien
is looking forward to the game but
is glad that his team does not have
to travel to West Point.

“It will be nice to play at
home,” O’Brien said. “Anyone is
capable of doing anything on any
given Saturday. Anything is possi-
ble in college football.”

Temple uses off week to prepare
, for Eagles -

The Owls will attempt . to
rebound from a 42-23 loss to
Bowling Green last weekend, and
they will have extra time to do so
because of an off week.

Temple head coach Bobby
Wallace was encouraged by the per-
formance of his‘ freshman quarter-
back last week, but said his team is
hurt by its inability to run the foot-
ball. ‘

team selected the name hoping to
sweep away opponents just like one
did Sept. 16, 1926.

Though there is no ‘hurricane
mascot, Miami does have Sebastian
the Ibis, one -of the nation’s most
recognized mascots. Story has it
that in 1926 the school’s yearbook
adopted the name “Ibis” after the
local marsh bird. A

The name’s popularity grew and
in 1957 a residence building on
campus called San Sebastian Hall
sponsored an Ibis entry in. the

' homecoming celebration. The next

year student John Stormont per:
formed at games in a homemade
‘Ibis outfit and the mascot stuck.
When Miami takes the field in
the Orange Bowl they have one of
the nation’s most famous entrances.
The “Smoke” entrance as it is com-

'monly referred to started in the-

1950s.

Hurricane players storm the
field through a thick cloud of
“smoke” that is actually made from
fire extinguishers before every
game while the sounds of a hurri-
cane play over the stadium’s sound
system. The original set up
alsoiincluded ﬂashing lights and

‘ two large hurricane ﬂags blowing

in the wind, but they fell to the
Wayside for today’s “smoke” and
wind sound entrance. , '

Miami also has ‘a few lesser

I known charms that add to a game in.

the Orange Bowl, including .‘-‘Lil’
Joe” and “Touchdown Tommy.”
“Lil’ Joe?’ was the predecessor to
the current “Touchdown Tommy”
cannon that is fired by the Sigma
Chi fraternity after each Miami
score. ‘

The Hurricanes have gone 10'

years without a national title and
have run into some troubled times
in recent years, but this year the
fans in Coral Gables have great
hope that Miami will bring home its
. fifth national title this season and

add to the mystique and aura of

Hurricane football. . ‘
