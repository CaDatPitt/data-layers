Wherein The Problem
Of Pitt’s Mortgaged
Stadium Is Discussed
In The Classroom

By RIELVIN ROGOVV

In one of the classes here the
other day, footliali was brought
into the discussion as analogous
to a point the professor was
making.

It was a triﬂe different than
most football talk. Instead of
wondering who would beat who
on Saturday, by how many points,
and at what odds-—the typical bull
session chatter——this discussion
looked beyond the surface, brought
out points about which it was
thought everyone know, yet in
fact, few know.

The talk began with the Father
Jones situation at Duquesne, went
from there to subsidization. Meth-
ods used by different schools ix.
subsidizing were analyzed. not
criticized. A general conclusion
drawn from this ‘was that college
football had better look to its lau-
rels——the out-and-out professional
game was providing :1 great show,
was making money for its pro-
motors."

ccording to this thesis, eventu-
al y the colleges would turn out
to be more minor leagues for the
professional teams, with propor-
tionately smaller crowds for the
colleges. One person set up base-
ball as the example of where the
colleges were leading themselves.

Old Remedies . . .

The remedies oﬁered were not
new. It was suggested, for exam-
ple, that the colleges should admit
that they are professional, take
the edge off the major league pro-
fessional football teams, save large
crowds for mortgaged stadiums.

The other not too new suggestion
was that it was perfectly all right
for the professional league teams
to ‘take the crowds from the col-
leges. Why shouldn’t the colleges
use amateur ball players, engage
more in intra-mural athletics?

And the answer to that was, in
every -case, “How about the mort-
gaged stadiums?” ,

Speaking of mortgaged stadi-
ums, Pitt stadium came into the
discussion. And there were more
cockeyed ideas-about the ﬁnancial
situation of Pitt stadium. Surpris-
ing, T00, since everybody and his
brother seemed to think he knew
all about it.

Financial Lemon . . .

Coming closest probably to the
truth were those persons who said:
The stadium, built at 3. cost of
about two million, one hundred
thousand dollars, something close
to a. million’ dollars over the esti-
mated cost, is deﬁnitely a. finan-
cial lemon. _

Two million, one hundred thou-
sand dollars worth of bonds were
sold when the stadium was built,
of which not one nickel has_ been
recalled. Why? Simply because
the “take” of thefstadium could
never amount to more than enough
to pay interest on the bonds, main-
tain other University athletics.

The ﬁrst $120,000 proﬁt made by
the University through the stadium
is paid out in interest to the bond-

holders. And after that come the ,

other sports, mainly losing propo-
sitions, and mainly insufficient as
is.

The bonds, coming due in 1944,
cannot be recalled at that time.
That much is obvious.

And so, the class attempted to
solve the athletic department's
problem for it. But they found
no solution.

read it, Samuel Harden Church
called on Mrs. Anderson to stand.

A little woman in a black and

her hair stood, third row center.

Otto Klemperer, father of the

up, gave a symphonic pep-talk in
a resounding voice which came as
a relief to the strained ears of the

Repeat

Recital For Assembly

B-y nonsnr BROWN

One of the ways in which.ele-
ments of the “great American tra-
dition” can be realized is through
the familiarization of themodern
person with original American
folk lore and songs. Such is the
opinion of John Jacob Niles, folk
singer from Kentucky.

Mr. Niles presented a program-

in the Stephen Foster Memorial
auditorium to the student body
last Thursday afternoon. He re-
peated the recital given to faculty
members and administrative offic-
ials last Monday. The student as-
sembly was sponsored by the SFA
concert hour committee.

In a rather hurried interview

backstage, Mr. Niles, in the midst

of getting his dulcimers in tune
and his equipment ready, gave his
reasons for his .tour of the United
States. According to him, the
“hillbilly” music that is created
by the Tin Pan Alley inhabitants
of 42nd street and Broadway is
not authentic. , . . ,

American folk. music singers in
the Kentucky mountains do not
follow the strict rhythm of pieces
such as: “I Like Mountain Music,”
and “She’ll Be Comin’ ’Round'the
Mountain.” Rather, they are a
curious compound of Negro spirit-
uals and songs that the early pio-
neers made up while engaged in

their everyday pursuits. He has
even traced some of the songs back
to Saxon England and the reign
of the Tudor kings.

“You must use a peculiar tech-
nique in getting this music,”
stated the singer. “If I were to go
up to these mountain homes with
a pen and pencil and ask the in-
habitants to sing for me, I_would
never C collect anything worth
while. However, I visit them, am
invited into their homes, and then
I- sing them songs from my collec-
tion.- After a while, »a greybeard
pipes up with a ‘Brother, that may
be singing, but wait until you
hear me.’ In these impromptu
‘jam sessions,’ I get many of my
new songs. "

Mr. Niles possesses a tremend-
ous range in his vocal equipment,
jumping from bass to treble with
ease. His singing of mountain
spirituals and carols with their in-
tricate harmonies and rhythms
made the listeners realize that
America has a rich tradition in
song that compares with the
lieder of Brahms and Hugo Wolf.

Having completed his recitals in

a concert tour of the East. He is
scheduled to give a series of radio
broadcasts over the Columbia net-

work.

THE PITT NEWS

Calamity, Dear:

.*By JIrene.Long, 

DEAR CALAMITY:

Will you please tell us wh

bookish circles‘?

THE UNINTELLIGENTSIA.

DEAR UNINTELLIGENTSIA:

Far be it from me to chisel in on
Mr. Hansen of the Press and Miss
Gihon of the Sun-Telegraph and
their book-reviewing cohorts, but
here goes for literature in the well-
kncwn nutshell!

If you have a sense of humor
and a liking for mischievous red-
haired boys you shall have much
fun reading “Life with Mother”
by Clarence Day. It will remind
you of the days when you slid
down bannisters, trailed reluctant-
l.y to Sunday-school, and tore your
rompers while scrambling through
cellar windows. There, that should
send some of you people scam-
pering off to the library or book-
store any minute now!

“Gone with the Wind,” by the
ziuburn—tressed Southern woman,
Margaret Mitchell, is still being
read by any one with the stamina
to do so. From a historical view-
point its descriptions of the Civil
War and the period of reconstruc-
tion that followed are authentic
and vivid. The characters are most
extraordinary. You may want to
sock a lot of them, beginning with
Scarlet O’Hara, but that naturally
gives punch to the book. Melanie,
yo.i will like. She is the gentle,
unselﬁsh s_o,ul whom Scarlet plays
in the middle all the time.

To some, Ashley Wilkes may be
the answer to a maiden’s prayer
.. . possibly your dream boat:
but he deﬁnitely lacks zoom in
many ways. On the other hand,
Rhett Butler has a surplus of
zoom; he never moans around
droopily, but whips out after
things. Mrs. Mitchell . probably
had an axe to grind in the moral
that like must marry like . .
and I strongly suspect her also of
having sipped tea with the DAR.

One of the best of the non—ﬁc-
tion books is Noel Coward’s auto-
biography,“ “Present Indicative.”
You will probably sympathize with
Mr. Coward in his struggles for
fame as well as with his perpetual
state of malnutrition. His can-
dour, wit, and eccentricities are
delightful. Among the latter was
his naive custom of taking baths
with . . . oh, you’d betterread it
for yourself!

“The Citadel” by A. J. Cronin,
the Scottish physician-novelist.

with its expose of the English
medical profession is a book that
should be read. Mr. Cronin flies
upon his brother doctors with his
typewriter and zeal—-enough to
make some of them hand their
heads and the rest to get hopping

the book is v‘alua.ble. Other than
that. it ria-rrowly escapes being a

by the way, holds the theory that

the Lost Dauphin of France. At
any rate, he was a unique person
--always dashing off into the for-
ests in search of his beloved feath-
ered friends, an intimate of the
pioneering Daniel Boone, witty,
handsome, reckless, determined,
persevering, loved by all, and a
worshipper of nature. ’
Those should keep you busy for
awhile. Let me know when you

PENN

Among the three or four thou-
sand things that bore me are Joan
Crawford and her res amores, on
or off the screen, a sample copy
of which is currently showing at
the Penn.

“The Bride Wore Red”
typical Joan Crawford melodrama.
She begins as a hussy and ends
by marrying a queer postman in
Tyrcl. In between she squeezes a
little gold digging while everyone
else spouts about the pines and the
mountains and how far the wind
has come to meet them there. All
of which sounded very silly to
Spanos, because everyone looked
so uncomfortable during the
whole business.

Certainly Franchot Tone in
short pants doesn’t make a very
happy picture. And Franchot
Tone drawling away at a sim-
ple philosopy is unhappier still.

About the only two people who
looked at all at ease were Robert
Young and Reginald Denny. Rob-
ert of course was permitted to
wear tails, so why should he

kick? And Mr. Denny was given
all the laughs in what may have
been ,perversel.y meant to be a
comedy, so he was satisﬁed.

I might give the story a little
plug here because no one else will,
I am" sure. The story is an ex-
tremely original copy? of Cinder-
ella. Of course little inimitable
Hollywood‘ touches have been
added here and there. Such things
as a drunken Count instead of a
fairy godmother and a Cinderella
who is extremely class conscious,
wants a red dress with beads, and
sloughs "off similes that would
ﬂoor the whole English depart-
ment. _ '

STANLEY

Every time I mouth off about
how much I go through to write
this column a bunch of unbeliev-

fers down’ to the Stanley this
week and make them sit through

Breen, ugh. I must have aged
ﬁve years watching that show.

Though I felt pretty mean about
Bobby and felt sorry for myself
and all that, I think that Basil
Rathbone suffered more than I.
Poor Basil, with all the Gene
I-laymonds and Dick Powells in
Hollywood, they have to pick on
him. He looked so lonely and

sad and every time he smiled at
Bobby his face seemed to freeze.
But enough, as they say in the

The stage show is alright.

ALVIN

Putting it allegorically, the Al-
vin opened with three of a kind,
didn’t draw a thing and lost the
pot. What I mean to say is, that
though the Ritz Brothers work
very hard “Life Begins at Col-
lege” is no bargain.

The story is thin, the jokes are
poor, and aside from the Ritz
brothers and a money mad dean
there isn’t much to commend the
picture. It concerns the football
fortunes of a small former Indian
school, Lombardi College.

Lombardi is in a pretty bad
way athletically, until a rich In-
dian makes the team and the Ritz
brothers make the rich Indian. He
has an income of ten thousand a
day and they" spend‘ it for him
with varying degrees "of comedy.
This" is probably the best picture
in town, accompanied as it iswith

As Referee Detects Holding;
Calls 15 Yard Penalty

By S. S. KALWARY
NEW  Oct. 16—At the Polo Grounds today, the Rams and
Panthers, two comparitively uncertain quantities, belonging, respec-
tively, to “Sleepy Jim” Crowley and Dr. Jock Sutherland, lined-up

determined to break their two-year record of scoreless ties.

But. fate,

unsuccessful ﬁeld goals, and fumbles intervened. Another 0-0 contest

was written into the books.

Fordham won the toss, and elected to receive.

game of missed opportunities and l of Scrimmage,

giant-size thrills was on. The

crisp weather and fast ﬁeld were
favorable to both sides. Starting
in the line for Pitt were Daddio,
Souchak, Matisi, Delich, Lezouski,
Petro, and Hensley, and in the
backﬁeld, Chikerneo, Goldberg,
Stebbins, and Patrick. Fordham
ﬁelded its unpronouncable, bone-
crunching line of Jacunski, Druze,
Berezney, Barbartsky, Kochel,
Franco, and Wojciechowicz, and
backs, Fortunato, Kazlo, Granski,
and Principe.
RAMS THREATEN

After Pitt. haddrawn a 5-yard
penalty, for offside, Kazlo, from
a punt formation, threw a nifty
pass to his partner-halfback,
Granski, for a 27-yard gain and a
first down on Pitt’s 43. Fortunato
punctured center for 2 more. And
it looked as if Crowley’s sophomor-
ic backfield was going to make an
end of Pitt-Fordham goose-egg
scores. But the Blue and Gold
eleven considered the Ram’s ball
carriers too young to keep up this
march, and promptly checked
them. Granski punted to Pitt’s 20,
and‘ the Panther machine proceed-
ed to strut its stuff. Stebbins,
Goldberg, and Patrick quickly
moved the leather up for two
straight ﬁrst downs. Fordham
ﬁnally took nossoecion of the ' ".
and completed two short gains,
as the ﬁrst quarter ended._

Jock inserted almost the entire
second tea mat the start of the
second period. The Metropolitan
athletes started off as they had in
the initial quarter, but were again
stopped.. Then began a series of
fumbles, the ﬁrst, by Urban, as he
was tackled, after racing off 23-
yards. When Pitt recaptured the
elusive sphere, after Fordham’s
Captain Druze had attempted a
ﬁeld goal from the 25, which was
low, and moved up to the mid-
ﬁeld stripe with it, Stebbins fum-
bled for the second time, but re-
covered. for a 6-yard loss.

BIGGIE’S SCORE SCORED

Goldberg, Patrick, and Chiker-
neo returned to the Panther line-
up. -Biggie drove through right
tackle for 10 yards and fumbled
when he was hit by Kazlo. Dan-
nies recovered for Pitt, and a gain
of 25 yards. A ﬂat pass from Pat-
rick to Daddio placed the leather
on the Rams’ 5—yard marker. Pitt
called for time out, with but 30
seconds in the second period re-
maining. And this is where the
heart-breaker of the contest oc-
curred.

Pitt: lined-up with Stebbins in
the receiving position. The ball
was snapped to him, and he whirl-
ed and. slipped_it to Goldy, who
dashed around the right side and
over the goal line, but not for a
touchdown! Pitt was penalized 15
yards for holding, thus nullifying
the six-pointer. Fighting desper-
ately to tally again-—-but clean—
the Panthers called Curly to pass.
His toss sailed into the arms of an
enemy back, but Fordham was
caught holding, and Pittsburgh
owned the ball on New York’s 7.

“Mad” Marshall tried the line, but
the “blocks of granite” qualiﬁed

thus ending ten

'quarters of scoreless football for

the East’s two most powerful out-
fits.

While the spectators ate hot
dogs and the alumni of the
two schools wiped mustard spots
their trousers—-alumni members
always drop mustard on their
clothes—the brilliant bands of Pitt
and Fordham executed their for-
mations. The ball p layers did’t
hear the instrumentalists. They
listened to vocal solos rendered by
their grid tutors.

STEBBIN S FUMBLES

Patrick took the opening boot

of the second half. On the very-

; first play Stebbins fumbled, and

F0rdham’s Mr. Jacunski scooped. It‘

Dame Man
By AL MALAKOFF

We were over at the Falk Clinic
one day last week, looking up Dr.
Carlson to get a little dope on the
basketball team. That the infor-
mation would be received was
doubtful, but the editor told us
when we were young and impres-
sionable freshmen that the reporter
always gets his story. So there we
were.

Well, the doctor came out of the
emergency room and we yelled.
But he didn’t answer a word about

basketball. “Come here” were the
gems of wisdom that fell from his
-lips. Knowing the good doctor by
some of hissbetter pranks we held
our ground. “C’mon,” he re-
peated, opening the door. Attractt-
ed by his dominant personality we
went inside the emergency room.

“Hey,” said Doc, “here’s an as-
piring sports reporter, give him a
story. - This,” he said to me, in-
dicating a fellow limping,” is Jack
Leddon. “It developed that Mr.
Leddon was the sports editor of
the South Bend Tribune, in town

Mike .Milligan

By HARRY LECKLER
Genial Walter “Mike” Milligang

‘has done a ﬁne job as mentor of;

the freshman grid teams during;
his regime the past two seasons;
From his 1935 freshman squad he 
placed ten men on the ﬁrst two
varsity teams last fall.

Marshall Goldberg, Bill Daddio,

John Chickerneo, Harold Stebbins, -
Elmer Ivlerkovsky, Al Lezouski,
Steve Petro and Red Fleming are §
all outstanding graduates of the 
Milligan school. 

He has scores of other promising -
candidates in preparation this fall, A
although his sophomore graduates,
will not have much of a chance to 
show due to the large number of;
veterans on hand. 

Milligan started his college foot-
ball career at Pitt in 1929. He was
a substitute guard that season, and
was the “stand-in” for Ray Mont-
gomery, who won All—American
honors. Again in 1930 he was an

Rocker Organizes
New Grid League

Harvey Rocker, director of in-
tramural sports and at present
busy concocting new dishes to
serve the intramuralites, has
come up with a variety of touch-
football schedules, among which
is an innovation in _the form of
an orientation league. .

This bracket will include only
freshman and it is the ambition
of Rocker to secure an application
from each college orientation
The skeleton schedule he
has drawn up calls for a ﬁve to
nine elimination bracket.

The purpose of this special
phase of the intramural program
is designed to stimulate interest
in the freshman for intramurals,
and to deﬁnitely give him an op-
part in
sports at Pitt. 

Like the Independent and Inter-
frat brackets the freshmanleague
will swing into action on the
fourth of November. The sur-
viving team in the elimination
series will meet the independent

ist clashes with a frat team for
the intramural title.

Furthering Rooker’s policy of
overlapping and “some thing do-
ing all the time” he plans to carry
this freshman orientation group,
into all branches of‘h‘-is intramural.’
