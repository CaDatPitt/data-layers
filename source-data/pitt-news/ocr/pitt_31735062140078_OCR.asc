Georgetown Meets Decisive Defeat at the Hands.

of Pittsburgh—Richards, Galvin, Dewar
and Whole Team are Stars

The fast growing spirit in the “Old
Uni” came to the surface very decid-

,edly last Saturday, when the varsity
triumphed over the great Georgetown

team. The old yells, reverberated
through" the crisp October air, mak-
ing every loy.al son of Pitt feel a
quiver run down his spine when the
blue and gold team trotted onto the
ﬁeld. Cheerleader Kirk started a suc-
cession of yells that put the whole
eleven in a spirit of “win or die.”
It is not the least surprising that
they walked through the Washington

lads as if they were tin soldiers. As
_the game progressed the-band struck

up the college songs; then the-Uni-
versity clap was heard and divided
yells addedzest to the occasion. To
be sure, Georgetown had a band too,
but, sad to say, the only thing they
could play that any one would re-
cognize, was “In the Good Old Sum-
mer Time.”

At the start, things were about
even, ,‘but the - Georgetown defense
soon began to weaken under the

ﬁerce assaults of Pitt’s backﬁeld com-'
. bination, and Richards

and Dewar
often got away for good gains, helped
by the clever interference of Hittner
and Brown. Galvin was the keystone
of the whole defense; he seemed to
be able to diagnose the plays very
well a,nd added more glory to him-
self by kicking tw"6‘-perfect place-
ment goals from the ﬁeld.

In the ﬁrst quarter no score was
made, although both Lindsay and
Galvin madetries ‘for ﬁeld goals.
Early in the second period Dewar got
away for 16 yards and Rich followed
suit by carrying the ball to the three-
yard line. “Lillie” Dewar then called
on Blair to open a hole for “Tex,”
which he did to perfection, and the
big captain carried the ball over the

line with a smile from ear to ear.

Galvin added the extra point without
trouble.
On the kickoff Fury returned 12

‘yards, a.nd on the next play punted

to Richards in the center of the field;

_ 7 who got back atout 8 yards. George-

I.
. I

town now braced and held Pitt twice
on the line, as Rich stepped back to
punt, but, instead ofpunting he made
a long forward pass to Lindsay,
which landed the ball on the 20-yard
line. Here‘ the- Washington lads
held for two more downs, so, nothing
daunted, Galvin stepped back to the
26-yard line and kicked a clean goal
from placement. This made the score
9-0.

At the start of the third period
Walsh returned Galvin’s kick-off only
5 yards, so Wymard punted on the
next play. In returning this punt'De-
war gave .a ‘great exhibition. of his
clever ability at running in a broken
ﬁeld. Richards got away around
right end, but ran out of bounds on
the 25-yard line. Brown then landed
the ball on the 7-yard line,’ and “Til-

lie” went through for a touchdown. t

Galvin failed at goal. Score 14-0
Shortly before the close of the third
period Galvin added three more
points tothe tally by duplicating his
placement "kick. 'This time it was
from the 25-yard line. '

In the ﬁnal quarter of the game
Pitt continued to outplay the George-
town team, but, no other score was
added. There was much penalizing

in this period. Offside plays were
frequent and Georgetown was once

penalized for half the distance to the
goal and Walsh dismissed from. the
game for slugging. The game ended
with the ball in Georgetown’s posses-
sion on their own 5-yard line, where
they had just held the blue and gold

for downs. The line up:

THE GAME NEXT WEEK.

The nextiopponent on our card is
the Ohio University eleven from
Athens, Ohio. Little is known of the
team representing the institution;
but i‘t is inferred that the players are
not in the same class as the majority
of the teams on the University sched-
ule this year. Even if the game prom-
ises to be a minor one that is no ex-
cuse for the lack of enthusiasm on the
part of "the students for the team
needs encouragement all the time
whether in the'big or little games.

SPALDING GETS OUT SCHED-
- ULE.

A. G. Spalding of this city has is-
sued a very neat card on which is
printed the schedule of the University
football team for the current, season.
A score card is also a part ofthe lit‘tle
souvenir, which is a very clever ad-
vertisement for the sporting goods
people. Copies are on distribution at
the ofﬁce.

'TREASURERS AT WORK.

The class treasurers are at their.an—
nual job, collecting band money for
the football games. To the Fresh-
men it may be said that this is a Uni-
versity custom which all loyal stu-
dents are expected to obey. Don’t
look glum when your treasurer comes

-after the money, but give cheerfully

for “Old Uni.” The splendid rooting
at the big games last year was largely
due to the encouragement by the
band.

A BUSY DAY.

Saturday morning is the real busy
day around the University if one may
take the large number of fair students
as any criterion. The numerous Sat-
urday classes offered in the school of
education and the graduate work
coupled to the regular morning
classes makes -the “University a verit-
able beehive. '

Governor

 

The board of trustees ‘of Princeton
University have accepted the resigna-
tion of Woodrow Wilson as president,
and appointed John A. Stewart ,of

Dr. Wilson presented a letter. to the '2

board setting forth that he had been

nominated for governor by the Demo- .

crats of New Jersey and _that_ he
deemed it his duty to accept. He
asked that the resignation be accepted
at once.

Following the reading of the letter
President Wilson left the meeting, and
the board formally adopted a resolu-
tion in which it accepted the resigna-
tion with deep regret.’

Dr. Wilson had been connected with L -.
the university for about 20 years and -

was made president in 1902.

. THE PTTT

Science Club

 

On Thursday, October 20, a prelim-
inary meeting of the Science Club
was held in order to plan the work for
the coming year. The guardians,
Dean Fetterman and Dr. White,
briefly outlined the purpose and work
of the society, and showed the need
of such in this community. Owing
to unavoidable circumstances, the or-
ganization was unable last year to
hold meetings, although there was a
fair enrollment of members. Previous
to that however, from the time it
was started by Prof. Huey, the Sci-
ence Club was successful in its en-
deavor and brought out many good
papers written by students in the
University,‘ as the records testify. The
work canundoubtedly be made both
profitable and interesting. A

In general the plan of the club is
to conduct a Round Table, discussing
current topics relating to psychology,
biology or sociology. Opportunity
will be given the members to present
papers on any phase of these subjects
before the society, and as often as
possible, prominent men will be se-
cured to make addresses along the
lines of scientiﬁc investigation. I
F It is urged that every one interest-
ed should join the Science club and
help make it a successful student or-
ganizationland one that will be valu-
able to the University. As soon as a
suitable time is found, the members
will convene for organization and will
discuss the adoption of a constitution.

Prospective members will please
give their names and a copv of their
schedule to-W. T. /Mitchell, ’l3, im.

HA1L TO PITT.

The song, “Hail to Pitt,” which was
given with much success last win'ter
at the Cap and Gown performance is
now on sale «at the leading shops in
the city, .where—it can be procured for
the nominal price of ﬁve cents.

It will /be recalled that the song
made a favorable impression with the
students last winter at the perform-
ance at the Carnegie Music Hall.
Thesong is a ‘true representation of
the spirit of the University and should
be in the possession of all ‘the stu-
dents.

iENGiINEER_Sl’i NIGHT.

The‘ reception to'the parents of the
engineering students will take place
‘tomorrow evening ‘in the assembly
room of Thaw Hall at eigh‘t o’clock.
The affairwill be strictly informal and
the attendanceof all students in the
engineering school is expected. Ad-
dresses will ‘bemade by Dean Bishop
and Professor Kinter. Full details of
the evening were given in the Weekly
last ‘week. ‘

WEEKLY

Tl1eMass Meeting

 

The mass meeting held last week
preparatory‘ to the Georgetown game
was the best since the spirited meet-
ings last year when the W. and J.
game has in mind. The cheering on
Friday morning was of the kind that
stirs ‘the true Pittsburgh man to ac-
tion. Cheer leader Kirk was surely at
his best in" the practise work and the
way -the yells rolled from the throats
of the students was inspiring. The
singing was full of life and the at-
tendance was so large that the music
had a full volume. These are the
things that strengthen the spirit of
“Old Uni” and it should be borne in
mind that the big games are coming
.now and that at'tendance at the cheer
meeting is a’ duty every University
man owes to the institution as well as
to himself. The invitation to the mass
meeting means you; if you are speech-
less come out and make a few signs;
if you are blind come out and hear the
noise; if you are deaf come out and
see the happy faces. There is no ex-
cuse for anyone, it is up to you, that’s
all. 1

GIRLS. WILL BE GIRLS.

Imbued with the spirit of Colorado,
the state of equal ‘rights, feminine
members of the freshman and sopho-
more classes of Denver University
held a little class “scrap” of their own
‘to the horror of the faculty and the
unrestrained joy of the hairdressers,
who will proﬁt heavily.

Profanation of the sacred freshman
colors by the sophomores, who fol-
lowed the 1914 banners in mocking
parade, started the trouble.

The freshman girls gathered thein
cohorts and rushed the procession to
rescue their colors. A Valkyrian war
cry a swirl of petticoats and the
light was on. True to the feminine in-
stinct, each militant maid aimed
straight for the coiffure. The air was
ﬁlled with. a shower of “rats,” puffs
and braids, and in a trice the college
campus resembled the interior of a
mattress factory. Shirtwaists were
wrecked and a few walking skirts will
walk no more. 0’

Superior experience finally told and
the freshmen were compelled to with-
draw.

~

The students are invtted to attend
the Schenley class of the Firs't ‘Bap-
tist Church, Dithridge street, which
meets ever Sunday at the Conserva-
toryiof Music. This class will have fa‘
good basketball and track team as
soon as the new church is completed
on Belleﬁeld avenue which will ‘con-
tain oneof the ﬁnest gyms in the
city. The members of the Schenley
Class will haveithe full use of it, the

have a class in gymnastics. The

ROE AT HIGH SCHOOL.

1 Homer Roe, the formerstar on the
gridiron for the Blue and the
Gold, is acting as coach at Pitts-
burgh High School in ‘the’ absence
of Professor Kerr, the regular coach
for ‘the lastfew seasons past. The
team at the,High school this year did
not have very promising prospects,
but, since Homer has taken hold the
stock of the boys representing the
Red and Black has gone up materially.

Mr. Kerr will not be able to [take
charge for the remaining part of the‘

year, so the entire work has been‘

turned over to the Pitt man. We look

for some very promising material for

the University next year with a Uni-
versity man at the head of the big
city ins'titution.

THANK. YOU!

CLASS VISITS THE SHOW.

The class in economics thirteen,
modern industries, visited ‘the land

show in the ‘garden last week under

the direction of Dr. Holdsworth where
many interesting points in the work
of the class were brought out by the
aid of exhibitsand lectures.

A special feature of the trip was the
arrangement made for the delivery of
two illustrated talks on the far west
and the
Messrs. Ellis and Lefﬁngwell, both
very prominent men in their respec-
tive callings in life. The former spoke
on the conservation problem which
this country has to face while the later
addressed the students on the question
of the far west. Both talks were
highly appreciated by the men in at-
tendance at the lectures. I

DEPARTMENT OF DENTISTRY.

' The football game between the
Freshmen and" Juniors ofthe Dental
school did not take place on October
20. as planned owing to their inability
to secure Forbes Field on that date.
The battle has been postponed until
some day this week, probably Satur-
day, and promises to be interesting
sport as both sides are thoroughly
conﬁdent of victory. I

A SLO GAN.

It has been learned from some un-
known source that the editors of the
coming Owl have devised a slogan
for the paper and it is not a bad idea
to say the least. We are not at liberty
to, divulge the character of the words
adopted but it is a splendid example
to all the student ac‘tivities in the Uni-
versity. More of the binding spirit

‘ is needed to make this institution the
really great thing it is 'to be in the

years to come.

Alumni Notes

 

The following letter is being mailed
to all the Alumni. There is only one
way to reply-SUBSCRIBE.

Dear Alumnus:

Another year has begun in the his-
tory of our University. The start is
one of great promise and the possi-
bility is that this well be the greatest
year thus far in old Uni’s history.
As a loyal alumnus you are no doubt
interested in all the amazing progress
already attained by the University
and no doubt you have often wanted
'to keep in closer touch with your
Alma Mater but you have been unable
to do so because of no adequate
medium. In order to remedy th'is de-
feet and also to keep up with the
rapid strides of old Uni, the Courant
Board for this year decided to dis-

continue the Monthly Couran't and is-

sue a weekly paper entitled “THE PITT
WEEKLY”. This paper (a sample
copy enclosed) chronicles all important
events which happen from day to day
in all parts of the University, also as
accurate an account of Alumni news
that can be obtained. No Alumnus can
afford to do without this paper. The
students and faculty are enthusiastic
and if the alumni are also with us, We
can issue a weekly -paper of the highest

' standard. Subscriptions per school year

by mail $1.75. May I enroll you as one
of our Alumni subscribers.
Sincerly Yours,
C. A. SANDER, C
Circulation Manager.

A STATE STAR HURT.

It hasbeen reported that Mauthe
the former DuBois I-I-igh lad and full-
back on 'the State team last vear sus-
tained a broken ankle.
quite a blow to our rivals as Mauthe‘

,plunging, defensive work and long

defeat last year at their hand.s State
has our sympathy and we hope
Mauthe will have recovered by

Johnston Bane gave a very enjoy-
ab-le'concert on the guitar in the as-

wish is made that more of this enter-
tainment will be provided in the

future.

A. Classical Club Meets

m....__..‘

The first meeting of ’the Classical
Club took place last Wednesday in
the Assembly room of Thaw Hall.
The meeting was for old members
only “the purpose being the organiza-
tion of the club for winter’s work.”
The next regular meeting will be one
week from today in the assembly
room, at which ‘time and those inter-
ested in the classics are cordially in-
vited to attend. This invitation is
especially extended to the members
of the freshmen class. A paper will

‘be read at Wednesday’s meeting by

Mr. Gillespie and a review of the cur-
rent classical magazines will be given
by Misses Riddle and Mclntosh.

It is desired to make the present
year the most successful in the history
of the club -and the only way the
results can be obtained is through the
cooperation of the students in the
attendance a't the meetings.

M; A. Goldman is the president of
the club and Miss Siverman is the
secretary.

NOTICE TO THQE PROFESSORS.

The circulation manager of the
Weekly has requested the professors
to get their copies of the paper in
their mail boxes in the University of-
ﬁce on the day of publication. There
has been some difficulty in ‘the distri-
bution of the papers to the members
of the faculty, but it is hoped to
eliminate the trouble by placing the
papers in the oﬂﬁce. ‘There has been
some lit'tle slowness of the circulation

but this is not due to the inefficiency

of the manager but to the general
haste in the arranging of the details
in connection with the paper.

PASTERS OUT.

The University pasters which were
devised and gotten out by a member
of the Soph. classes are now on sale
and they are really worth buying.
The paster is" in the form of a dia-
mond on which its the lettering Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. P. O. Davis is
the man who can supply the pasters
for the small price of two for ﬁve
cents or ﬁve for ten cents.

‘Friday evening, November 4th, at
,“the Seventh Avenue ‘Hotel. The
1 ﬁnal plans have been made and all

, V C, that remains is the duty to be there.

. the idea of getting ‘the engineers
if  thoroughly acquainted, not alone
‘with each other, but, with many of
-the_ -leading engineers of the com-
munity. It is hoped to have at the
-coming banque't a large number of the
engineers of this part of the State in

attendance to address the students on »

Tlive topics. The tables are going to
‘be arranged in small groups in order
»‘that the. students can intermingle to
5the greatest advantage. Songs and
_  all the features of ‘the real banquet
 will be introduced. In a word the af-
 fair cannot be missed by any engineer.
 The Weekly will print the full pro-
 gram in the issue of next week.

SECTION IS RESERVED.

A section in the grand stand has
been reserved for the use of the wo--
men of the University at the remain-
ing football games of the year played

_ at Forbes Field. The student books

may be exchanged at ‘the box office
at the ﬁeld on and after twelve thirty
of the Thanksgiving game and after
1 o’clock at all other games. The
move is a good one on the part of the
manager, as the girls were formerly

at a great disadvantage in ‘the bleacher '

seats erected in the field for the use
of the men. The request is made that
the reservations be made as early as
possible on the part of the students-
as on and after a certain time the
regular price will be charged for the
reserved section.

THEY DON’T AGREE.

The Weekly has called the atten-
tion of the members of ‘the faculty in
the department of mathematics to the
following clipping culled from an ex-
change:

“A prominent member of the La-
fayette faculty says that mathematics
is ‘the most overrated and useless of
“college studies.”

Our faculty does. not however, agree
with the learned man from Lafayette.

if A SOCIAL EvENT.

The Georgetown game here last
Saturday was somewhat of a society
event, many prominent‘ seminary and
college girls were in the city on ac-
count of the game. The visitors were
entertained by the families of prom»
inent Georgetown Alumni, There
were a number ..of__'theater and house
parties arranged in the honor of the

college people.

class on Corporation Finance and In-
vestment. Despite the severeness of

entire class, Mr. Holdsworth cour-
ageously persisted with his work and
the instruc'tions with but
slight interruption.

A quiz examination of the Even-
ing School students in the class on
Money and Banking, will be held on
October 27th. Questions on any part
of the studies reviewed up to that date
will be given.

WELCO ME TH E” VSTRAN GER.

When you see ,a stranger on ‘the
campus do not try to see how uncivil
you can be, but be as courteous as it
possible to be with. a stranger. This,
a very small thing, is often hard to
do, but it does not cost anything ‘to
be polite in “this world and so why not
be extravagant in the use. To be
a real University man or woman the
art of Politeness_ must be extended to
the stranger within the gates.

ADDRESSES Y. M. C. A.

Dr. Frank Schlesinger of the Al-
legheny Observatory‘ addressed the
members of the East Liberty Y. M.
C. A. last Saturday evening on the
subject “Past and Future of‘ ‘the
Earth.” Dr. Schlesinger is a ﬂuent
talker and his address was much ap-
preciated by the hearers. '

H FRESH AT EAST LIBERTY.

The Freshmen football
playing ‘the East‘ Liberty Academy
eleven on the latter’s ﬁeld this after-
noon. ‘A large number of the ﬁrst
year men are going to attend the
game, and root for theirifavorites.
The East Liberty team is not very
fast ‘this year and it is likely that the
Fresh will emerge from the contest
victorious this afternoon.

Next Monday the Fresh will play
the Indiana Normal School at Indi-
ana, where it is probable that the Uni-
versity Fresh will be forced to do
their best if they expect to gain a
victory. The Normal teams are al-
ways counted to give any visitor a
hard tussle and this game will not be
an exception itoithe general rule.

A SPLENDID SONG.

The song, “Hail To Pitt” received
its ﬁrsti University_trial last week and
to say that it is" good is putting ‘the
question mildly. The ditty has a
swing and go that cannot be forgotten
after it has once been heard and hum-
med. The words are by Kirk, ’l3, and
the music by Taylor, ’l2. Every stu-
den't should have a copy of the song,
whether he can sing or not,'for it has
the ring of the true spirit.

CAP AND GOWN MEETING.

The cap and gown club will meet
tonight in the assembly room at
Thaw Hall at eightuo’clock for the
purpose of‘ organizing for the season.‘
All members of the club are urged to
attend the‘-‘meeting tonight as “the
business is important. Plans are form-
ing for the best production the Uni-
versity has ever had in its history.

DINNER TONIGHT.

The 1912 Owl board is meeting this
evening at the Fort Pitt Hotel, where
a dinner is being served as the means
of getting the men on the board thor-
oughly acquainted with each other.
Aside from the regular members of
the board 1no' one else is in -attendance.

THE PITT WEEKLY

Hail to Pitt

 

T Down in smoky town in Pennsylvania.

in Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,

We’ve a University, we’re all proud of
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh ;

She stands a mighty fortress ’neath her
colors bright, Pittsburgh, Pitts-

burgh—

VS/hen forth she goes to battle ’gainst

a stubborn foe,

This song will upward go.

CHORUS. -
Hail to Pitt, Hail to Pitt, every loyal

son.

Hail to ‘Pitt, hail to Pitt, ’till the Vic-
tory’s won.

The Gold and Blue shall wave forever,
on high thro’ fair. and stormy
weather; we’ll sing her praises far
and wide until the end of time. A

Hoop hurray, hoop hurr_ay, for dear old
Uni. . ‘

Give her a grand old Al-le—ge nac—ge—
nac—ge—nac-ge-nac. —

We’ll wave and cheer, for many a year,
and sing her songs out loud. and
clear, for our Un-i-vers—i—ty.

VVhen the grand old days of football
come around, in Pittsburgh,. Pitts-
burgh,

Rooters at the ﬁeld will make an awful
sound: Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh ;
Down across the ﬁeld her mighty line
A moves on, Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh;
They’ll sweep the foe before them ’till

V the goal is won, 4
Then you will hear them shout.

UNIFORM PINS.

The Senior class. is at the present
time making arrangements for their
class pins and the desire has been ex-
pressed to make all such emblems in
the future of a uniform design. The
upper classmen have asked the Juni-
ors to consider the plan of uniformity
and it is likely that ‘the two classes
will agree upon the matter of making
all the pins of the Senior classes
alike.

The president of the Junior. class
has been requested to appoint a com-
mittee toiconfer with the Seniors,
who are already on the pin committee.
Speaking to a Senior the other day a
representative of the Weekly learned
that it is the intention of the present
class to elevate the senior pin above
the standing of the past, that is to
make the pin' of graduation mean
something more than the mere seal
of the University, which can be pur-
chased at the various st-ores. It is
hoped that the present upper classes
come to some deﬁni'te understanding.

FACULTY MEETS TODAY.

A general meeting of the faculty
will be‘ held this afternoon at 4:30
in room 109 Thaw Hall. The general
standing of the ‘students will be con-

‘ F erguaon Block, ‘ ‘

What the Others
Are Doing

According to an inter-sorority‘
agreement at Allegheny College, no
sorority may rush or pledge new
members until the beginning of the
second semester.

The Freshmen lost the Cross-
Country Run to the Sophomores at
Worcester Polytech. The affair is an
annual one. '

Over forty per cent of the Fresh-
man Class at Lafayette has been
pledged by fraternities at that college.

Yale University receives $700,000
according to the will of Samuel H.
Lyman of New York City.

Soph and Freshman Medics at Van-
derbilt University have signed a
pledge never again to indulge in the
pleasant sport of hazing. Recent
“sprouts parties” held by ‘the, classes
led to this step.-Tartan.
