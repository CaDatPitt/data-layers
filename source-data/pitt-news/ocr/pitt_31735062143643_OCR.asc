‘The Pitt checker club twice
defeated the Carnegie Tech
club in a pair of recent matches.

- The first match, played in the
Y. M. C. A. hut on Thursday,
March 26, resulted in a sweep-
ing 21-3 victory for Pitt, while
the second staged at Carnegie
Tech on March 31 also ended
with an ‘18-4 score in favor of
the Pitt club. , _

Although neither the Pitt or
Tech checker clubs are as yet
recognized, both are actively in-
terested in promoting the play-
mg‘. of checkers. ‘The Pitt club
haspissued challenges to Geneva,
W. &. J. and Duquesne in an ef-
fort to secure matches and stim-
ulate interest. Students inter-
ested should see Mr. Straney or
