Jay Costa, Pennsylvania Senate Dem-
ocratic Leader, answer and discuss
questions regarding critical issues
such as the Port Authority budget cuts,
health coverage and tuition increases
during the meeting in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom. The audience includ-
ed morethan 80 people — organizer
and GPSA President Nila Devanath
said itwas a good turnout.

Devanath said she chose to invite
Costa, who represents District 43, be-
cause she wanted to feature someone
on the state level so students could
ask about issues pertainingto Pitt and
Port Authority.

Duringhisaddresstotheaudience, ,

Costa emphasized his ties to Pitt. The
state senator; who is on Pitt’s Board of
Trustees, said he has a “fondness for
Pitt.” Both his wife and son attended
the University.

Although some students might
not immediately associate the state
government’s ﬁscal problems with
higher education, Costa stressed the
connection. '

“If there is a loss in state revenue,
tuition increases are a possibility,” he

, said.

Pitt saw a 5.5 percent tuition in-
creaselast year.
Because of Pitt’s close ties vviththe

state, Costa urged students to take V

“Students have become strong
advocates for the state to make good
investments in the commonweal ”
Costa said. “We need to replace ﬁmds
because these students represent the
best and brightest and come here to
get a fair and reasonable rate.”

Henry Goodelman, agraduate stu-
dent in the School of Education who
said he has spent over $100,000 on
tuition and living expenses, attended
the event — partly because he is afan
of Costa’s advocacy for higher educa-

tion, city and commonwealth issues. _

Hotel
life not
ideal

Ryan Shaughnessy
For The Pitt News

It looks like the normal freshmanis
college dorm room: two beds, two
desks and an array of Xbox 360, PS2
and other video games and movies
strewn across the floor.

But then there is the 32-inch ﬂat-
screen Philips TV, the complemen-
tary microwave and refrigerator and
double beds instead of extra—long
twins. Above the bathroom there
is a plastic “No Smoking Permit-
ted” sign‘.

These living arrangements aren’t
unique for the 48 residents of the
third ﬂoor of the Wyndham Uni-
versity Place Hotel, who, along with
two resident assistants, are some
of the only students housed by Pitt
off campus.

The entire third ﬂoor of the
eight-ﬂoor Wyndham is dedicated

to these Pitt students through a J

one-year contract Pitt signed with
the Wyndham in fall. 2010, after
realizing their enrollment rates far
exceeded expectations.

Pitt spokeswoman Patricia Lo-
mando White declined to comment,
and directed further questions to
previous news stories on the sub-
ject.

“We had a larger number of stu-
dents in temporary housing this
year,” White said in an article in the
Pittsburgh Post— Gazette. “We knew
there would not be enough attrition
to get them into a regular room early
on in the semester.”

Because of these high matricu-

are running dry for many state pro-
grams, and politicians are lookingfor
multiple ways to stretch the budget.

Budget problems for the transit

dents..

Port Authority will be issuing 15
percent service cuts in late March,
creating inconveniences not only for
commuters and city residents, but
students who live on campus, too.

lation rates, Pitt had to come up
with alternative housing options
for students.

According to one of the hotel’s
residents, freshman Taylor Keane,
part of the group calls themselves
the “Wyndham 50.”

“For a while we were known as
sort of celebrities on campus,” he
said. “Everyone that I talked to had
heard of our situation, and there
were a few articles about us.”

Pitt offered the “Wyndham 50”
housing in the hotel the summer

before the start of the fall 2010 term. '

All 48 residents paid their housing
deposits late and do not have guar-
anteed housing at the University.
Besides the students in alterna-
tive housing at the Wyndham, there
are 92 students living in converted
lounges in Lothrop Hall and Litch-
ﬁeld Towers. There are nine addi-
tional students who do not even
live in a Pitt dormitory —— they live

“We’re tryingto make certain that
we have a conversation about mass
transit sooner ratherthanla'ter,” Costa
said. “We need to ﬁnd ways in which
we can raise revenue.”

One method was met with disap-
proval from audience member Ali-
cia Williamson, a ﬁfth year graduate
student in the School of Arts & Sci-
ences.

“I’m glad he’s an advocate for mass
transit, health care and educaﬁon, but
Iwas disappointed with the solutions
he offeredfor mass transitﬁmding—
renegotiating workers pensions. But
I’m happyheisagainstprivatization,”
Williamson said.

In the past, methods to raise rev-
enue have included a net-proﬁt tax
on oil companies or gas taxes, Costa
said.

Resolving the situation isn’t lim-
ited to lawmakers in Harrisburg ,—

in Carlow University’s Dougherty
Hall.

Students in the Wyndham live
two per room, pay $2,750.per se-
mester — the same price as most
doubles on campus —— and have a
guard on the ﬂoor for security.

Unlike other Pitt freshmen, the
hotel residents have a bevy of hotel
amenities available to them. ‘

“Students can use anything in
the hotel except room service,” said
Dezirae Stephan of Wyndham guest
services. “They can use the hotel
shuttle to go to places other than

class or on campus. For example, _

one girl took it to the train station
before break.”

Stephan said that room service
is restricted because only managers

and maintenance are allowed access ,

to the third ﬂoor.

Other perks of Wyndham living
include access to the hotel gym fa-
cilities. There is also athird-ﬂoor

Devanath was quick to point out that «

students can make a difference too.
Students and community mem-
bers can sign a state-wide petition
on the GPSA website. Devanath said
those who signthe petitionarevoicing

transit system. ,

Devanath said about 300 people
have signed the petition, but said
1,ooo would be “grea ”

Costa also spent time to answer
one student’s question regarding the
expiration ofPennsylvania adultBasic
coverage. ' .

Adu1tBasic is alow-income health-

" care coverage program that covers

about 41,000 people at a cost of $36
per month. There are also people on
the waiting list.

The health—care program is of-
fered through Independence Blue
Cross currently projected to be in ef-

student lounge with atreadmill, el-
liptical, abdominal machine, rowing
machine and exercise bike. Students
travel from the third to sixth ﬂoor
to utilize the two washers and dry-
ers. ,

Stephan said the room sizes vary
on the third ﬂoor, but estimated the
average room size to be 12 feet by 15
feet. A room in Litchﬁeld Towers is
about 17 feet by 11 feet. I

Though living in a hotel might
sound like a luxury, Keane and his
roommatejon Nighswander are not
so keen on the situation.

Last Friday, the two found out
from Panther Central that they,
along with all other Wyndham stu-

dent residents, would not be able ~

to choose their roommates for the
coming year.

The students understood that
because they had paid the housing
deposit late, they would not re-
ceive guaranteed housing for their

feet untiljune 2011.

However, adultBasic might be
coming to an early end, with funds
set to expire at the end of February.

The state has already sent letters
to, members to let them know of the
expiration, whichwill mean members
and those on the program’s waitlist
will have no coverage beyond that
date. _ _ .

» . Costa said there is another option,
calledthe SpecialCar_e program, but it
costs about $140 per month and offers
dilferent beneﬁts, he said.

Costa also mentioned PA Fair Care,
atemporary health -overage plan for
those who need insurance and have
pre-existingconditions, but said that
there are “about 1,000 openings for

42,000 people.”

According to the Pennsylvania In-
surance Department website, the pre-

ﬁrst three years at Pitt. However,
they did not realize that this also
excluded them from rooming with
students who do have guaranteed
housing. ’

Nighswander and Keane had
planned for several ‘months to
room with friends on the guaran-
teed housing list next fall.

“The University didn’t do a good
job of informing us about tha ,”
Keane said. “They made no effort
to say you can’t room with people
who are on the list.”

He added the University could
do a better job of reaching out to
students in the Wyndham to make
them feel more like a part of Pitt. .

C “It’s not as glamorous as, every-
one thinks it is,” he said. “It really
does suck. We’re here because we
don’t have housing contracts.”

' Nighswander said their ﬂoor
lacks social unity and Keane is un-

' sure if he is getting the “organic”

miumfor PA Fair Care would be $293
a month and that “3,500 individuals
could be enrolled in the program in
the ﬁrst year.”

SGB president Molly Stieber
urged students, undergraduates in
particular, to participate in Pitt Day
in Harrisburg, which will take place
April 5; On the trip,,students will be

‘able to talkto legislators about issues
such as PortAuthority,cuts and tuition-

increases.

_ « Devanath said she hoped that
students left the event with a sense
of their own ability to speak to leg-
islators. -

' “Most people think they don’t
care for one person, that their one
phonecalldoesn’t matter, but people
shouldn’tbe intimidated by politicians

“I hope they gainasense of conﬁdence
to speak out.” I

Pitt oﬂicials declined to com-

. or whether it would renew its one

year contract with Wyndham.
There will be a 155~bed addition
to the Bouquet Gardens apartment

complex that will house students

next year, and the University has
plans to build another residence

When asked why the Wyndham
originally agreed to this short-term
contract, Stephan said with a smile,
“Because it makes us a lot'of money.

during months when occupancy in

The kidney that ended the
argument

Disputing theories and pos-
tulates is something that uni-
versity professors do best.
Most of the time, these argu-
ments are conducted civilly,
but as a story out of Cal State
Northridge teaches us, some-
times things can get messy.
According to KTLA News,
a math professor, allegedly
engaged in a dispute with a
colleague, is being accused of
urinating on his opponent’s
door on multiple occasions.
Since the teacher specializes
in algebraic geometry, we’re
just wondering how he found
himself in a ﬁght over what’s
clearly an issue in Nonverbal

however, the discussion was all
about sports — because of the

Letters to the editor

To the Editor,

Oliver Bateman’s Valentine’s Day
piece: What bégan as an allega-
tion of bad taste has become
—,— according to one student’s
Facebook wall — a campaign
to “twistthe knife” to ruin
Bateman’s career. This furor is

about a column that allegedly

encourages sexual assault. How
so? Bateman caricatures college
dating life: wooing a girl with a’
pizza, two cases of beer, a goa-
tee anda scalp massage. No sex
occurs, no sex is intimated, no
sex is advised. “Date rape” is an
absurd conclusion.

You see, this is how real dam-
age happens. These are the social
and rhetorical strategies that

marginalize, that shut people up:
equivocation, name-calling, vi-
cious backchannels. When “let’s
start a conversation” becomes
“let’s distort and destroy,” pos-
sible progress ends. Dialogue
stops. Witch hunts begin. And
no, these people are not radical
outliers. Though Campus Wom-
en’s Organization -has stepped
back and is encouraging allies
not to personally insult Oliver,
its original letter was an ad
hominem attack: “We wonder
if Bateman has taken the time
to get to know anywomen as
individuals.” _

What’s worse, these straw-
men battles undercut legitimate
causes. Advocacy groups stop

’ looking forward and content

themselves with ritualistic pas-
sion plays. Finding big targets
on which to pin “sexist” or “op—

. pressor” is a tired tradition. The

most recent CWO publication on
the matter is a lengthy, patron-

izing essay on how “real”'pro—

gressives admit their wrongs. No

one is talking about issues, just
the’=social theater surrounding-
them. We need true dialogue,

debate, education. Not grand-

standing and moralizing.

To the Editor,

Regarding Oliver Bateman’s col-
umn “After MLK Day, now time
to seduce ‘sweetie,”’p no one is
trying to crush the genre of
satire beneath their heel. No

one is certainly trying to say‘

a man (presumably) can’t be
progressive or feminist. I think
the Campus Women’s Organiza-
tion had it right on the money
with its first response: Even
anti-oppression folks can hurt
the communities they stand in
solidarity with. What needs to

happen is for those folks to sit
down, shut up and listen.

. Rape should never be a
punchline, period. It should
never be a punchline in good
satire, and it should never be a
punchline in a piece that didn’t
fulfill its intended genre.

Bateman owes those com-
munities a genuine apology, and
then healing can start.

And if you think feminism
is silly or that CWO is too sen-
sitive, look at the 1ocked—up
comments’ on that thread. The
commenters called me stupid,

called CWO stupid, equated our
collective “stupidities” with
cultural genocide, stamped
their feet and decided that date
rape wasn’t rape, that waiting
for someone to imbibe before-
propositioning them wasn’t
rape and said that rape culture
isn’t a relevant orimportant
issue.‘

There’s still a.lot of work to
be done. ‘

To the Editor,

I find it reprehensible that l

The Pitt News featured three
separate pieces’ Wednesday
(“Greeks question probation,”
“Pitt should .set clearer penal-

ties,” “Letter to the editor”).

discussing the social probation
within the Greek community
which, as the editorial clearly
states, includes only 10 percent

of the student population. The a

fact of the matter is that the
majority of the students who
are not Greek affiliates simply
don’t care to read about the ter-
rible injustices suffered by these

students whose elected leaders
made a mistake. Whether or not

’ the punishment fits the crime

is not something I am qualified

to comment on, but neither is.
it something I want to see plas- V

tered on every other page of my
student newspaper. I find it ri-
diculous that The Pitt News even
publishes letters to the editor
with such ludicrous statements
as “Dean Kathy Humphrey...[is]
forgetting the good Greeks do
for this campus and trying topget
rid of us.” It’s a shame so many of
the smaller (yet no less philan-
thropic or high-achieving) cam-
pus organizations struggling to

ﬁnd recognition among the Uni-
versity community —— that would
be elated by exposure from The
Pitt News —— don’t ever get the

opportunity because of the mo-

nopoly held by the all-important
Greeks. The fact that Tuesday’s
presidential State of the Union
address was not once mentioned
is further evidence of this news-
paper’s increasing irrelevance ’
among a diverse student body
thirsting for actual news, both’
local and national.

FILM ANALYSIS

 

‘Black Swan’ in context

A‘ronofsky"s distinctive style on display in new ﬁlm

"Randi Alu
For The Pitt News

If the Oscars are any indication,
a lesbian sex scene, ballerina
melodrama and brooding mad-
ness seem to be a potent com-
bination. ‘
The Academy released its list
of nominees last Tuesday, and
Darren Aronofsky’s most recent
ﬁlm, “Black Swan,”'is in conten-
tion for ﬁve awards. Along with a
best picture nod, Aronofsky is in
the running for best director.
Aronofsky is no stranger to
receiving awards — his most
straightforward film, “The

Wrestler,” received two Oscar
nominations — but most of the
director’s recognition has been
from independent ﬁlm festivals.
After all, Aronofsky’s direction
—— an intriguing combination of
French New Wave cinema and
Kubrick-esque dark absurdity
— is distinctive, and not always
accessible. '
Aronofsky’s choice of style is
always the driving force behind
the mood of the ﬁlm, as he lets the
style convey part of the story. His
breakout 1998 ﬁlm, “Pi,” is a grit-
ty, maddening, black-and-white
apocalypse that leaves the viewer
simultaneously exhausted and re-
evaluating existence. Similarly,
the vivid color, strange camera
angles and addictive, repetitive
scenes in 2000’s “Requiem for a
Dream” bring the audience down
into the swirling, damaging vor-
tex of drug abuse from which no
one escapes intact. .
b How does “Black Swan” com
pare to its older siblings? The Os-
car nod is a clue to the answer.
“Black Swan” can be seen as more

“mainstream” than several of
Aronofsky’s other works.

For one thing, Natalie Port-
man and Mila Kunis are very well-
known actresses who always draw
a crowd bothfor their looks and
their talent. Shaped by endless
hours of ballet training, Port-
man’s convincing portrayal of an
innocent dancer obsessed with
perfection landed her a justified
nomination for best actress. Ku-
nis, for her part, was not nomi-
nated for best actress in a sup-
porting role. Not very surprising:
Although she did a fantastic job
in “Black Swan,” the character
was by no means a stretch for her.
We’ve seen the rebellious, saucy

Mila before in “The Book-of Eli”
and “Extract,” only this time, Ku-
nis was in ballerina form.
Another distinction of “Black
Swan” is its smooth chronology,
starkly contrasting Aronofsky’s
earlier works, which often feature
jolting cuts and awkward time-

’ lines. The use of a more main-

stream narrative did not detract
from his style, however. He ab-
sorbed the classic ballet melodra-
ma and repainted it beautifully
on acinematic scale. Alongside
a sweeping score, “Black Swan”
loosely mirrors the themes of
the ballet “Swan Lake.” The main
character's descent into madness
ends in the breathtaking climax
of both the ballet and the movie.
It’s overly dramatic, but effective
and moving.

Aronofsky’s style in “Black
Swan” is more refined and subtle
than in his other works, but it is
still intact. The ﬁlm is enthralling
in itself, but is better appreciated
within the context of his entire
body of art.

BOOK COLUMN

Hickey: Don

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

Afew years back, Spinner.com
posted a list of 10 chart-topping
songs whose creators now play
them grudgingly or not at_ all. Ra-
diohead lamented the success of
“Creep” (at one concert,‘ its audi-
ence booed the band members
until the song was played). The
Beastie Boys groaned when “Fight
for Your Right (To Party)” became
the un-ironic anthem of the folks it
was meant to lampoon. Madonna

~ said you’d have to pay her 30 mil-

lion-dollars to ever sing “Like A
Virgin” again. V

As anartist, it’s got to be frus-

trating to be loved and Vremem-
bered for a work you don’t consider
your best. And although authors
very rarely come out and “disown”
their most popular books -— pos-
sibly because, unlike musicians,
they’re not expected to perform
these works aloud to large audi-
ences day in and day out — they

are not immune, in this columnist’s _
humble opinion, to being known"

for a novel that doesn’t accurately
reﬂect their talents. ‘

Anthony Burgess’ “A Clockwork
Orange” is perhaps-the most im-
mediate example, as the author

- made like a rock star and dismissed
the best—selling novel himself. In

’ his nonﬁction book “Flame into

Being,” he calls “A Clockwork Or-

ange” “a jeu d’esprit knocked off

for money in three weeks, [which] V

became known as the raw material
for a ﬁlm which seemed to glorify
sex and violence.”

Like the Beastie Boys, Burgess
cites widespread misinterpretation
as the main cause of his distaste for

- his most celebrated work. For this

misunderstanding, he blames the

— ﬁlm and the American publisher

whochose to omit the work’s 21st

for several of his plays, whereas

-“Napoleon Symphony: A Novel in

Four Movements,” imagines the
life of Napoleon Bonaparte, and
is written around the structure of
Beethoven’s “Eroica” symphony.

One can sympathize, then, with '
-the author’s frustration at being

known as the man who penned a
funny-talking gangbanger’s hand-
book in 1962. A

Perhaps the lesson to be drawn

ger’s lesser—known “Franny and
Zooey,” which explores the same
themes of mental-illness, adult fal-
sity and adolescent frustration, but
without the oppressive ﬁrst—person
self pity that made 15-year-olds all
over the country hate “Catcher.”
Other books you’ll read in class
at the expense of the authors’ bet-
ter works seem tohave been cho-
sen for their thematic simplicity.
Such is the case with Margaret

Perhaps the lessonto be drawn from
Burgess’ plight is that shock value  
isa common reason for a book to be  

remembered at the

chapter, in which the protagonist
reaches young adulthood” and
grows bored with his destructive
lifestyle.

And who could blame him for
being peeved that “A Clockwork

-Orange” was recast as a celebra-

tion-of all things “ultra-violent,”
when the novel has been remem-

. bered at the expense of his more
‘ intelligent works? Burgess is re-

sponsible for dozens of novels
written over the span of almost
40 years. “Nothing like the Sun”
chronicles Shakespeare’s love
life_ and explores the inspiration

from Burgess’ plight is that shock
value is a common reason for a
book to be remembered at the ex-
pense of the author’s better work.
The success of]. D. Salinger’s “The
‘Catcher in the Rye” —— which is
simultaneously one of the top—10
most frequently challenged books
in America and one of the top—10
most widely assigned in schools —
seems to support this theory. _
Don’t mistake me: I might lose
half my readership for saying it,
but Ilove “The Catcher in the Rye.”
However, I would be glad to see its
place in schools usurped by Salin-

expense of the author’s

Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,”
a feminist dystopian novel whose

V spelled-out cautionary tale about

the dangers of the Religious Right
pales in comparison with the am-
biguity and multilayered storytell-

ing in Atwood’s other works, such“

as “Alias Grace” and “The Robber
Bride.” ”

As a feminist and a die-hard

Atwood fan, I enjoyed “The “Hand-
m_aid’s Tale,” but it doesn’t escape
the predictability and moral two-
dimensionality that plague most

’ dystopian novels. Similarly, Edith

Wharton’s “Ethan Frome” —— ac-

i’t judge authors by their bestsellers

cording to hearsay at my high‘
school, one of the most hated r_e—
quired reading books in history
— is described by the author and
critics as a “tale” rather than a nov-
el, its lessons difficult to dispute.
Meanwhile, Wharton’s “The House...
of Mirth,” a novel that deals with
the sametheme of obligation vs.-
personal fulﬁllment with more nu-
ance and against a different socio-
economic backdrop, unfortunately
receives little attention.

It’s tempting to write off an au-
thor because you read his or her
most famous book and disliked it.
But I would advise readers to fol-
low up a book that left a bad taste
in their mouths the same way they
would follow up a book they loved:-»
by researching the author’s other
work to "see what else they have
to offer. . ,

Obviously, no reader owes
an author a second chance, and
perhaps there’s something else
you’d rather be doing with your
time — like reading a book whose
author pleases you consistently.

But if your ﬁrst taste of a writer

is not consistent with the rest of
his or her repertoire, a bad read-
ing experience could be the ironic"
beginning of a wonderful journey
into an author’s more rewarding
body of work. Many a European
history buff could miss out on a
great body of speculative ﬁction
if they let “A Clockwork Orange”
put them off. . ‘

Greg Trietley

(I.

Plenty of players have come and gone during
Jamie Dixon’s tenure as head coach of the Pitt
basketball team. Dejuan Blair, Sam Young and
Aaron Gray all found a place in the NBA after
playing for the Panthers.

But coaches, too, have learned under Dixon
and moved on to head coaching jobs at other
schools. One of them,’former Pitt assistant
Mike Rice, will faceihis old team as the head
coachdof Rutgers when his Scarlet Knights
takeionthe No. 2 Panthers Saturday at 8 pm.

for the 2066-07 season, when Pittmade it
to the Sweet 16 and brought in a recruiting
class that included Blair, Brad Wanamaker
and Gary McGhee.

But now Rice has to ﬁnd away to shut down
Wanamaker and McGhee, currently seniors

One of the reasons Wanamaker commit-

“Rice became one of the Panthers’ assistant

coaches. Now, Wanamaker said he wouldn’t

Rice, a Pittsburgh native, ‘has done well

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

 

Upsets ravage Big East

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

   

A slew of upsets threw Big East basketball
into upheaval this week. Five big ones, in-
cluding two by Providence of all teams,

‘have threatened the conference’s elite, at

least when itcomes to their ranking. So
I’m going to have a little fun and rate this
past week’s upsets.

5. No. 7 Villanova 83, No. 3 Syracuse
72

Villanova dominated the Orange from
beyond the are ——~ especiallyin the ﬁrst half,
when the Wildcats opened up an 11-point
lead. They were able to survive a late rally
—— ’Cuse closed to within four with just
under three minutes to play — and won
by that same 11-point margin in front of
a season—high crowd of almost 34,000 at
the Carrier Dome.

4. Providence 72, No. 15 Louisville 67

The Friars picked up their ﬁrst confer-
ence win — against their old coach, no less.
It was the team’s ﬁrst win over Rick Pitino
since he left in 1987 to coach in the NBA.
Providence’s Marshon Brooks poured in 27
points, and the Cardinals shot an abysmal
4-23 from 3-point range. P

3. No. 14 Notre Dame 56, No. 2 Pitts-
burgh 51

Ben Hansbrough led Notre Dame into a
hostile environment at the Petersen Events

Center, where his team was able to down ‘ C
the newly No. 2-ranked Panthers. Han-

sbrough registered 19 points and seven
assists, and the Irish were able to hold the
most eﬂicient offensive teamin the nation
to only 51 points.

2. Seton Hall 90, No. 10 Syracuse 68

Syracuse, who a week ago was one of
only a handful of unbeaten teams left in the
country, lost its thirdstraight game — and
badly. The Seton Hall Pirates are the confer-
ence’s worst shooting team but were able
to shoot 54 percent on the Orange and shot
10-17 from beyond the arc. The game was
ugly from the start, as Seton Hall opened
up a 13-point ﬁrst—half lead.

1. Providence 83, No. 7 Villanova 68

The Friars went almost a year between
Big East victories before beating Louisville,
but then only had to wait four days for their
next one. This second consecutive victory
over a ranked team was very similar to the
ﬁrst: Brooks led the way with 20 points, and
’Nova shot only 4-22 from 3-point range.

It’s not going to stop there -—- over the
course of the next week there are a plethora
of chances for more conference shaking.
Tomorrow is especially jam—packed: Pitt
visits Rutgers, Louisville travels to Con-
necticut, Georgetown goes to Villanova
and slumping Syracuse is at‘Marquette.

On Monday, Louisville is at Georgetown,
and on Wednesday Syracuse is at UConn
and Marquette is at Villanova. On Sunday,

V there is a chance to pull a big one over on

the ACC as Duke travels to St. John’s. An
upset, although unlikely, would really an-
noy those Blue Devils.

Power Rankings

1. Connecticut — The upset-bug did
not strikethe Huskies this week, and they
rose to ﬁrst place in my power rankings
after Pitt fell to Notre Dame. They remain
tied for second in the conference standings
but ‘have ripped off six straight wins since
losing two of three. UConn hosts No. 19
Louisville tomorrow.

,2‘. Pittsburgh + The Panthers fall to
second in my rankings but remain atop
the Big East even after suffering their ﬁrst

' conference loss of the year. When you have

seven top—20 ranked teams in the same
conference, you can’t expect to win them
all. Pitt plays three unranked teams before
it travels to Villanova Feb. 12, but if this
week told us anything, the Panthers can’t
afford to get caught looking ahead.

3. Villanova — ’Nova had an up-and-
down week. First, the Wildcats defeated
the then-No. 3 Syracuse Orange before fall-
ing to the suddenly red-hot Providence
Friars. They match up with Georgetown,
this week.

4. Notre Dame — The Irish have a
penchant for beating top-10 teams. They
defeated UConn and Georgetown, both
ranked No. 6 at the time, and registered a
big road win over No. 2 Pitt.

5. Syracuse — The Orange have suf-
fered a big-time slide since their loss to
Pitt. I would have dismissed losses to the
Panthers and Villanova, but Seton Hall?
Jim Boeheim, your team is better than that.
Get it together.

6. Louisville — The Cards rebounded
nicely from the disaster that was the Provi-
dence game with an exciting one-point vic-
tory over WVU. Louisville has been pretty
consistent this year, but really lacks a top-
notch victory. It gets its chance against
UConn tomorrow. '

7. Georgetown — The Hoyas have seem-

_ ingly righted the ship after a disastrous 1-4

slide, winning their last three. However,
none of theirthree opponents were really
that good. They can attempt to validate the
top-10 ranking they held earlier this season
with a win over Villanova Saturday.

8. West Virginia -— The Mountaineers
had a perfect upset opportunity against
Louisville but couldn’t close out. West Vir-
ginia has proven it can beat good teams, but
it can also lose some head shakers, which
earns the Mountaineers their eighth-place
ranking. ‘
