 

Grek Week to help

By Travis Senseny
Staff Writer

The holidays, combined with
recent severe weather, has
not only inconvenienced
many students returning from
winter break, they have also
caused what could become
a disastrous shortage of
platelets.

Platelets, which are the clot-
ting components in blood, only
have a life span of 5 days.
Therefore, platelets are impos-
sible to stockpile like some
other blood products.

On a typical day Pittsburgh’s
Central Blood Bank distributes
around 400 units of platelets to
the 40 regional hospitals it
serves. As of last Thursday,
Central Blood Bank had only
153 units of platelets available
to be distributed.

Let 's play ball...

platelet shortage

Judi Matok, director of Blood
Services, said, “The blood bank
is already cutting hospital
orders for platelets by 40 per-
cent. After that point, there’ is
little that can be done to pre-
serve the platelet supply and
still maintain therapeutic treat-
ment for patients.”

The recent snowstorm
caused the cancellation of
blood drives and donor
appointments last Tuesday and
Wednesday. The result was
almost 900 lost donations.

Dave Edmunds, a senior con-
sultant for the blood bank,
said, “We need 700 units of
blood per day. If you can’t
draw for three days, that puts
you in an emergency situation.”

The snow also delayed or
cancelled shipments of
platelets from out-of-state

Cancer Institute tests new
vaccine for advanced cancer

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

A new vaccine designed to treat .-people
with advanced breast, colon and pancreatic
cancer has been developed and is being test-
ed for the first time at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

The vaccine, which is based on a substance
found on cancerous cells, was approved by
the Food and Drug Administration in mid-
December. According to Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute immunologist Olivera Finn, who
developed the vaccine, the new treatment is
the first of its kind to be used with cancer
patients.

“This is the first synthetic peptide [protein
fragment] cancer vaccine in clinical use,” Finn
said. “Our vaccine has an excellent chance at
stimulating an immune response against can-
cer cells that is more specific than we've pre-
viously seen with other cancer vaccines.”

immune responses to the  vaccine in labo-
ratory animals and other pre-clinical
research."

According to Lauren Ward, assistant direc-
tor of UPMC’s News Bureau, at least two
patients have received the new vaccine since
a press conference was called Dec. 29 to
announce it. The vaccine will eventually be
given to 50 patients with widespread or
advanced breast, colon or pancreatic cancer.

“This is the first place that a vaccine of this
type has been used,” Ward said. “It’s very
unique, very new.”

However, Ward said testing of the new
vaccine is still in its earliest phases.

“lThe vaccine] is only being tested on peo-
ple with later-stage cancer,” Ward said. “If
things look good, it may be fused with people
with earlier stages of cancer, but that will be
in the future.”

Pitt residence balls to

implement voice mail

By John B. Moore
Staff Writer

The "University of Pittsburgh
has finally added an entrance
ramp onto the information
highway.

Starting in January, occu-
pants of campus residence
halls will be able to use voice
mail through the Student
Telephone Service.

ATC:T’s AUDIX voice mes-
saging system answers incom-

message for the student.
With the AUDIX system, stu-
dents will also be able to send
messages to other users of
AUDIX.

for up to seven days and can
be retrieved at any hour by
using a touch-tone phone.
Although a date for comple-

Robert Hopkins, director of
Housing Services, said he is

aiming for the beginning of

this month.

Hopkins said it is his intent
that when the residence halls
open on Jan. 2, the installation
will be complete.

“There may be a building

Committee continues search for Pitt law school dean

By Jennifer Vernet
Staff Writer

Last year, a 14—member com-
mittee spent about $20,000 to
find two candidates to fill the
vacant dean’s seat in the
University of Pittsburgh’s
School of Law, according'to
present search committee
Chair Randy Juhl.

This year, after spending
thousands of dollars and
investing a full year into the
search, former Provost Donald
Henderson ordered the search

to start all over again from
square one.

Since last year, several stu-
dents in the law school have
asked the question, what hap-
pened last year? What’s going
on this year? And, will there be
a dean next year?

John Camillus, former chair
of the law dean search com-
mittee, attributed the failure of
last year’s search to bad timing
and poor faculty support.

“Our first big problem was
the fact that some faculty mem-
bers felt we began the search

too late in the term. Then, we
ran into problems at the end of
the search when we were invit-
ing the candidates to visit the
school,” Camillus said. “Many
of the candidates had conflict-
ing schedules and we just
couldn’t get them here when
we wanted to.” ,

Camillus said the last search
began in the 1992 fall semester
and ended on March 24, 1993
when the committeerformally
submitted two names to the
provost.

The committee selected

Michael Olivas, professor of
law and assistant dean for
research at the University of
Houston Law Center, and
Stephen Goldberg, dean at
Pace University School of Law,
as their two top choices for the
dean position.

“We originally hoped to con-
clude the search by February
or March, but we didn’t hear
from the provost until April,
and he had the final decision,”
Camillus said. i

“When we submitted the two
names to the provost, the fac-

ulty’s number one choice was
not on the list. In fact. the per-
son didn’t even get on the top
five list, and so they recom-
mended to the provost that a
new search be held this year."
Camillus said. “The provost
decided he could not make a
clear choice based on only two

‘ candidates, and so he decided

to select a new committee and

reinstate the search this year.”
The second committee,

which was appointed last sum-

mer by Henderson, began pre-

Student environmentalists participate in

By’Robin Senor
Staff‘ Writer

Pitt’s Student Environmental
Action Coalition is extending its
action off of Pitt’s campus and
into the realms of the federal
government.

The SEAC, which last month
protested Pitt’s consideration of
the Mt. Graham project with a
sit—in of Pitt Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor’s office, is
now taking part in filing an
appeal against the U.S. Forestry
service.

The “Shingle Mill Appeal” is
being filed by Preserve
Appalachian Wilderness against
the Forestry Service.

PAW is suing because of the
Forestry Service’s plans to sell
land in the Allegheny National
Forest to timber and mining

companies. SEAC has become’

involved in the lawsuit by gain-

ing intervener status in the
issue.

“What that means is that we
have written letters to the U.S.
Forestry Service and joined
forces with PAW,” member Matt
Peters said.

“PAW is a group of student
scientists in Delaware. They
have a section called the
Allegheny Task Force, which is
the section that filed the suit,”
he said.

According to Peters, the pro-
ject is being appealed because
the U.S. Forestry service is act-
ing outside of environmental
laws.

“The National Environmental
Policy requires responsible fed-
eral officials to prepare environ-
mental impact statements on
proposals for legislation and
other major federal actions sig-
niﬁcantly affecting the quality of
human environment. Basically

what that is saying is that offi-
cials have to investigate how
the action will affect the envi-
ronment. In this case, that
applies more directly to the
endangered species,” Peters
said.

SEAC members said they plan
to visit the forest this weekend.

In other business:

0 SEAC members also said
that two events need to
be planned immediately. One
is solidifying the organization.

“The problem that I see is that
our group doesn’t have Very
clear decision-making powers,”
Peters said.

“Structurally that is good, in
my opinion, because there is
no hierarchy within the group.
The down side of that is that
there is no one specifically to

look to for empowerment to A

carry out certain activities.”
SEAC members made plans to

a filing lawsuit against (1.5. Forestry Service

discuss the organization of com-
mittees that deal with specific
issues.

0 SEAC is also looking to plan
a campus—wide meeting.

“I look at this meeting as real-
ly important because it sets
the tone for the entire semester.
We need to let people know
that we are a very important
organization on campus,” Peters
said. "

0 Also important to members
was the issue of fundraising.

“We have tables reserved
Monday and Tuesday in the stu-
dent union to sell T-shirts,”
member Mike Kaizar said.
Money from the T -Shirts will go
to support the organization and
it’s interests.

Member John Farley, a local
musician, said he will be
playing at Java Jeffs in Squirrel
Hilljwith proceeds going to
SEAC.

Whoever said you have to
give up your toys when you
grow up obviously never met
Tom Megalis.

Megalis plays with puppets
and clay — and makes
money at it. Recently, one
of his clips in object pup-
pets and clay was chosen
for MTV’s “Free Your

faculty member at Pitts-
burgh Filmmakers, which
offers filmmaking courses
to Pitt students. Megalis
describes his clip, which
he recently produced to

comes and takes it down
and builds Buddha, or what-
ever. Each time it’s bigger
and more extravagant,” he
said.

“Then, a lightning bolt
comes down and hits the
last icon and all there is
is just this peace symbol
kind of thing, and grass
grows up around it really
fast.”

For the MTV contest,
Megalis was given the oppor-
tunity of choosing among a
group of discriminatory fac-

gin, religion, personal
beliefs, gender and sexual

As we begin the new year, the region’s blood supply
has been crippled by harsh weather conditions, there
could be no worse time for a blizzard than the week
following the extended holiday season. Nearly 900
donations were lost in just two days due to canceled
drives and donors’ appointments.

The campus community can help avert a crisis.
All eligible donors are urged to give at campus
blood drives sponsored by University Greek
organizations, beginning Monday, January 10
through Friday, January 14. All donors will
receive a T-shirt for their support. For more
information or to schedule an appointment, call
Central Blood Bank at 4 5 6-1 980.

For nearly a decade, the university of Pittsburgh has
been the second largest blood drive sponsor in the

According to blood bank officials, the present shortage is
much worse than the shortage caused by the blizzard in

» March 1993.

Since the platelet shortage threatens the treatment
of patients with cancer, leukemia, blood disorders and
any procedure where hemorrhaging needs to be stopped,
the Central Blood Bank is encouraging all eligible people to
donate as soon as possible.

Matok said, “The only way to guarantee continued med-

‘ ical care for patients relying on platelet transfusion is for‘

every healthy adult who is able to reach a mobile blood
drive or donor center to give as soon as possible.”

All healthy adults over the age of 17 can donate. Other
than cold and flu symptoms, there are few medical condi-
tions or medications that would render a person ineligible
to donate. *

University of Pittsburgh students will have an opportunity
to donate blood in Forbes Quad today until Friday.

The blood drive is sponsored by the Pitt Greek communi-

- ty. “Anyone is encouraged to give,” said Scott3Mahdi’k, a

Vaccine

Continued from page .1 P - I

tor with Finn on the project, said the outlook for .

the vaccine looks good even though additional
research is needed.

“Because this is a phase I or preliminary trial,
we are only in the first stages of evaluating this
vaccine,” Lotze said. “Based on laboratory
results, however, it appears promising for use in
a clinical setting.”

Patients will be able to receive the vaccine on
an outpatient basis, Lotze said. The vaccine will
be.less dangerous than surgery and other forms
of treatment such as radiation therapy and
chemotherapy. A

According to Ward, the vaccine is designed
to stimulate the immune system based on
differences between cancerous cells and regular
cells.

Researchers developed the vaccine from a
form of mucin, which is formed by protein
and sugars found on the surface of breast,
colon and pancreas cells. The mucin protein is
usually covered by sugar molecules and is
found only on cells which line the ducts in these
tissues.

In cancerous cells, however, some of the
sugar molecules do not form, leaving the pro-
tein exposed and susceptible to attack by the
immune system. Mucins also cover the -entire
surface of all cancerous cells, not just those
found along ducts. -

Finn said the mucin peptides in the vaccine

have been found to elicit a strong immune
response to mucins on cancer cells.

“Our vaccine combines a localized, concen-
trated amount of a mucin peptide and a sub-
stance called adjuvant that attracts immune cells,
thus greatly increasing both the odds that the
right immune cells will encounter the mucin
protein and the efficiency of the whole
process,” Finn said. ‘

According to Finn, the reaction between the
peptides and adjuvant results in an abundance
of killer T cells (immune cells which can directly
attack and kill cancer cells anywhere in the
body). She said these cells act separately from
another type of immune cells which create anti-
bodies to fight diseases. '

“Cell-mediated immunity [the action of killer
T—cellsI is considered much more effective
against cancer than antibody production, which
is the therapeutic basis for most cancer vac-
cines,” Finn said.

According to American Cancer Society esti-
mates, 128,000 people will die this year of
breast, colorectal or pancreatic cancer. Ward
said the vaccine might eventually be used to
treat other fatal cancers such as prostate, ovari-
an and lung cancer.

Ward also said the vaccine may even be used
someday to prevent some forms of cancer from
forming.l

“That’s a very long—term goal,” she said. “It’s»
definitely way down the road.”

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, January 10, 1994

Search

Continued from page I

liminary work for the new
search in July 1993. Formally,
the search began at the begin-
ning of the fall semester, and
the applications are still trick-
ling in.

Juhl, also dean of the School
of Pharmacy, said even with
the failed search last year, the
committee is right on target
this time around.

“So far, it’s gone really well.
\X/'e’re still in a very confiden-
tial stage, but wehave 50
active applicants, and they’re
still coming in,” he said.
“\X/e’re near the end of seeking
applications, and we'll begin
screening them soon.” Juhl
said the names of the appli-
cants will be held until later
because of potential conflicts
in their current employment
situations.

juhl said the new committee
is a fair representation of every
constituency the dean would
represent.

For example, of the 11-
member committee, four peo-
ple represent the law school
faculty, one person represents
the law schoolstaff, two stu-
dent representatives, one
alumni of the law school, one
representative from the
1§rovost’s office and two repre-
sentatives from other Pitt
departments, the Learning
Research and Development
Center and the School of
Pharmacy.

juhl said the process is

rather long and complex with
three separate stages in the
search.

“Once the committee
is selected, we began by
soliciting nominations from
Pitt’s law faculty and staff
and also the faculty, presidents
and provosts of other universi-
ties. We also place advertise-
ments in law journals detailing
the position. Once we receive
the nominations, we send out
letters and informational pack-
ets to each potential appli-
cant.” ‘

Juhl said the committee is
currently at the end of this
stage.

“The next challenge is to do
a thorough reference check of
every applicant and solicit
opinions from the faculty and
staff of the law school.
Eventually, we'll narrow the
pool to about eight to 12 can-
didates. We invite the eight to
12 candidates to campus for
interviews and open forums
for students, faculty and staff
members.”

According to Juhl, this stage
costs more than $1,000 per

"candidate in travel expenses,
— meals and housing.

Overall, the search process
takes about $20,000 which
includes mailing and tele-
phone costs, and for informa-
tional packets sent to the
applicants. The committee
members are not paid.

Juhl said in the final stage of
the search the committee sub-

mits three unranked names to
the provost who has the final
decision in the process.

Although the chancellor and
provost do not participate until
the latter stages of the search,
some controversy has brewed
as to whether or not former
law dean and interim Provost
Mark Nordenberg should have
the final word.

“At first glance, you could
see how there might be a con-
flict of interest,” Juhl said.
“But, you have\to remember
that he was chosen as the
provost by the chancellor and,
obviously, has a wide knowl-
edge of law. He is certainly
qualified to make the deci-
sion.”

Janet Helfand, representative
of the provost’s office, said the
reason Nordenberg’s qualifica-
tions should not be in question
is because he was chosen by
the chancellor.

“The chancellor explained,
on one occasion, his decision
to allow the provost to
make the final decision,” she
said. “lN_ordenbergl did not
make the decision [that
Nordenberg has final say], and
the committee. did not select
him.”

Juhl said the committee is
determined to find a dean that
meets the qualifications set by
the different constituencies
involved.

“There’s a different emphasis
from different people,” he
said.

“Most people, including the
provost and dean, want to see
minority and women candi-
dates. Both the chancellor and
the provost expressed a strong
commifment to not having an
all white, male pool of appli-
cants.”

Loretta Lobes, student repre-
sentative to the committee,
said the students are also com-
mitted to finding minority and
women candidates.

“We had to do a more ‘grass

said.

“I went through a list of

dates around the country,
through their biographies, and
came up with 10 potential can-
didates. We’re going out of our
way to find minority and
women candidates.”

“The students want someone
who has strong administrative
skills,” Lobes said.

“Someone they can go to and
voice their opinions about
issues in the law school. This
year, there has been Igoodl
communication in the school,
and everyone wants it to con-
tinue.”

Lobes said the students also
want to see a candidate who is
interested in soliciting funds
for computer systems.

“Hopefully, the candidate
will be on the cutting edge of
research, and will be someone
who is forward looking in edu-
cation.” .

Juhl said the ideal candidate
must be someone whose repu-
tation is not questioned. “We
are also looking for someone
who is a recognized leader and
scholar, and must understand
that the dean’s job is not an
easy one.

“The person must have ener-
gy and vitality. The dean’s
job does not go from nine to
five, five days a week. Often,

I the job goes from nine to nine,

six or seven days a week. The
job requires someone commit-
ted to every waking hour,
because the dean’s job is never
done.

“The expectancy rate for a
dean to stay in a position is
about fiveyears, and the job is
becoming less attractive. There
are less resources to spend,
costs are going up and there’s
less time to spend with the stu-
dents.”

Interim Law Dean Richard
Seeberger said there are about
176 American Bar Association
accredited law schools
across the country, and of
those, there are about 40 to 50
openings for a law dean at any
given time. _

Seeberger said neither he nor
his associate, Sandra Jordan, is
seeking to permanently fill the
position.

Juhl said the greatest obsta-
cle the committee had to face
this semester was the lack of
response from women and
minority nominees.

“T here’s not a large number

of potential minority or women’

candidates to choose from. All
universities are desirous of
bringing in women and minori-
ties. However, Pitt has a good
law school with a nationally
recognized faculty and a fan-
tastic student body. That alone
can make the position more

and so fulfill the Law of Christ.
—Galatians 6:2

attractive to a potential candi-
date."

Juhl said he hoped the
process would move faster and
wished the committee had
started earlier.

“I fear that we’ll lose a
potentially great candidate if
we don’t move faster. I think it
would have helped if we had
started earlier.”

Lobes said that despite the
failure of last years search and
the slow moving process this
year. the committee is having
positive results.

“I don‘t think the last search
affected this year’s Search at
all. So far, we've had a
good range of candidates,” she
said.

‘‘\We’ve called everyone and

it's paid off. Everyone would
like to pick a candidate and be
done with it. but we're really
trying to combat the ‘slacking
off‘ stigma.“

Juhl said the committee plans
to speed up the process
and have the candidates nar-
rowed to eight to 12 choices
by the beginning of this semes-

ter. The formal conclusion‘ of I

the Search is slated for Marci‘
1994.

“The further we go along ir
the search, and the more deci-
sions we have to make. th(
more difficult the tasI<
becomes.“ he said.

"A college dean, as a repre
sentative, is an important job
and we hope to bring the hes‘
person."

[AUDIX] will be the standard.”

The reasoning behind
adding the voice messaging
system is linked to an informal
survey conducted in the resi-
dence halls.

Through the survey, it was
discovered that many students
came to college with an
answering machine; many
rooms contained more than
one. '

“All answering machines
take up outlets and are a drain
on the system. Many students
are using plug multipliers,”

said Hopkins. With the ines-
saging system, Hopkins said,
students won’t feel that they
have to buy answering
machines and bring them to
school.

According to Systems
Analyst Mark Christian, with
voice mail you handle each
message individually, and can
delete any one.

Christian said that with voice
mail students can correspond
with their professors via the
system.

“If you have a question
about a quiz, you leave a mes-
sage with your professor, he
listens to your message and

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

responds immediately."

“With voice mail every stu-
dent will have a mailbox,” said
I-Iutchison.

“It is the telephone version
of e-mail,” he said.

With the AUDIX system,
Hutchison said every student
will have a way of getting their
telephone answered without
having to buy extra equip-
ment.

He said it would also

“improve communication
between the students and fac-
ulty.”

Bruce Hall resident Keith
Palmer said the addition
of voice mail in every resi-
dence hall was a good con-
cept.

“I don’t have an answering
machine, and I didn’t want to
buy one, so I think it’s a good

idea.”

Chrissy Dileonardo, a resi-
dent of Brackenridge, said she
agrees that AUDIX would be
an asset to students.

“If it helps communication
between students and faculty,
I think it’s a good idea.”
But, Dileonardo said it proba-
bly would not stop students
from buying answering
machines. “They're still going
to need the answering
machines once they leave the
dorms.”

As "of Jan. 7, the AUDIX
voice messaging system was
not installed in all of the resi-
dence halls, but according
to Jim Stuckert from the
telecommunications office, all
of the student dorms will have
voice mail by the end of the
month.

Corrections need more than jail

Recently, a report from the Pennsylvania Commission
on Corrections Planning offered some intelligent sug-
gestions to Pennsylvania’s prison problems. According
to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, over a 10-year period
from 1981-91, the amount of money spent on prisons
increased by 263 percent.

The amount spent on prison spending as compared to
other forms» of spending is outrageous. “The state

A spends 86,127 a year to educate one child, but $20,000

a year to house one prisoner. ”(Post-Gazette).
The report has some workable solutions which the
state should enact in order to end this madness. Their

recommendations include using prisoners to perform ,

community service on a large scale, ending mandatory
sentencing laws and forming partnerships with private
corporations that use prison labor. I

This last suggestion provides a way for victims to
receive restitution, in the form of money, while prison-.
ers pay their debt to society.

These proposals also attempt to break the cycle of
crime in first-time offenders. They recommend counsel-
ing for first time drug and drunk—driving offenders.

They also recommend county jail sentencing and the
use of electronic monitoring devices to keep criminals

' under house arrest.

This keeps people from entering a system from which
they may come out hardened criminals instead of pro-
ductive members of society.

Finally, the commission was not solely concerned
with saving the state money. They also recommended
that courts have the ability to increase the minimum
sentence for “high—risk, dangerous offenders.” They
§l§R ¥S9RiR¥R§R¥l§i-l llaiiéhii-‘IF sentences for repeat offend-
ers andviolent criminals.

The benefit to society by using alternative sentencing
is twofold. In the long run, money is saved for other
programs.

By using alternative methods for nonviolent criminals,
space that should be used to keep violent criminals out
of society will be available.

The state legislature should review these proposals
carefully. They could make the difference between an
effective criminal justice system and one which does no
service for the society it is designed to serve.

As Representative Thomas Caltagirone of the House
Judiciary Committee was quoted in the Post-Gazette, “It
makes good sense. It’s better to put them in treatment

than in prison. We should save prison cells for the vio-

lent offender”.

This year should see common sense applied to solu-
tions whose current form makes no sense. It only
makes sense those who harmed society in the form of a
crime pay back the community with service.that would
benefit everyone.

_(the College Republicans and a

Graduate's advice solves world problems

After four—and—a—half years, I’m finally finished
with college. And now that I’in done, it’s time for
me to write the obligatory what—I-have—learned
column. This is the point at which I’m supposed
to crawl up on to my soapbox and tell everyone
about what I have learned. “You should do this”
and “avoid doing these sorts of things.” The next
step is for me to hand out kudos for groups I like
and “a big thumbs down” to groups that I dislike.
Along the way, I’m also supposed to pepper my
good-bye with cute little bons mots that will
make my column memorable. It’s a fairly simple
plan. Unfortunately for me, I’m unable to_ follow
through with this plan. You see, I °

attempt to enrich your lives and impress myself.
The problem has less to do with any one than it
does with the fact that there is nothing new under
the sun. The last thing anyone needs is to hear a
bunch of rehashed homilies about what’s so great
or so terrible about college life.

Even if I could find something new and excit-
ing to tell you that would improve your lives, it
still wouldn’t be worth doing. Even if my advice
made sense, it wouldn't be effective unless you
believed to be true. You can know something is

This is why this kind of good-

couple of the girls I used to date.)

It’s been filled with frustration (the Pitt football
and basketball teams), and moments of genuine
happiness (finally moving off campus and a sur-
prisingly large. number of my classes.) I’ve also
managed to learn a few things, both in and out of
the classroom.

When I look back upon the way I was at the
beginning of my freshman year and where I am
now, I’m often taken aback by just how much
I’ve changed. There are also many days where I
find myself fretting over how much I’ve
regressed, but that’s another story.

In the end, however, what matters are the ker-
nels of wisdom that I’m able to pass on to all of
you. It’s here that I come up snake eyes. There’s
nothing that I can say that hasn’t already been
said. There is nothing truly new, profound or
insightful that I can offer. It’s not that I lack the
will or the wit to spew out a few platitudes in an

end, there is nothing that I can
tell you because you’ve got to figure it all out for
yourselves (and please, no Life of Brtanesqzte
choruses of “Yes, we are all individuals.”)
Wisdom comes from living, not from the opin-
ions of others.

I wish my last column could be more inspiring,
but that’s the way it goes. I’m having a hard
enough time trying to figure out what to do with
my own life, so you are just going to have to do
without another set of didactic little tidbits.

I can tell you are all heartbroken, but fear not.
I’ll still be around campus from time to time, so
it’s not as if I’ll be completely out of the picture.
In fact, if you want to, feel free to stop on the
street and have a little chat with me. I’ll be more
than happy to talk with you. In fact, if you’re
nice, I'll let you buy me a beer. Adios, everybody!

On Thursday, December 9th, I picked up a
copy of The Pitt News, and anxiously flipped
to my favorite section, Showcase. My excite-
ment quickly turned to dismay when I caught
a glimpse of the Showcase cover page, titled
“X-MAS ISSUE.” I was shocked to see the lack
of respect The Pitt News had for a very signifi-
cant Christian holiday. Though it has become
secularized and commercialized by society, it
is important to remember that, CHRIST mas is
not a trivial novelty associated with winter and
Santa Claus. CHRISTmas, is the second most
sacred holiday of the year (Easter is the most
sacred). With this in mind, I feel that The Pitt
News went too far when they dropped CHRIST
from the holiday’s title. Without Christ, there

’ should do so by giving the CHRISTmas holi-

would be no CHRISTmas. Without
CHRIST mas, your newspaper would not have
felt it necessary to put out a special holiday
issue.

The bottom line is respect. Over the past
few years The Pitt News has been criticized for
ignoring many ethnic, social and religious
groups. Consequently, I am glad to see the
paper including references to Christian holi-
days. However, if the paper chooses to con-
tribute to the holiday spirit on campus, it

day the respect it deserves.

Pitt struggles at line, losesto Orange, 79-75

Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

Saturday night at Syracuse
the thermometer plummeted
below 10 degrees outside the
Carrier Dome. Inside, it was
not much better as the
Panthers shot a frigid 54 per-
cent (19-35) from the foul line
as they fell to the. No. 18
Orangemen 79-75.

“You can’t shoot 33 percent
from the line at the half and
expect to be in the ball game,”
coach Paul Evans said. “We
shot the foul shots much better
in the second half but we can’t
play at an away ﬂoor and let a
team get a lead because of
foul shots.”

Pitt shot a horrid seven—for-
21 in the first half which was
clearly the difference.

At the beginning of the
game it looked as if free
throws would not figure in the
outcome. "Pitt jumped out to a
22-9 lead with center Eric
Mobley scoring 14 points in
the first eight minutes.

Mobley, who had 16 at the

career-high 28 points to go
along with nine rebounds and
two blocks. ’

Syracuse answered with an
11-1 run that was highlighted
by a three—pointer from Adrian
Autry which cut the lead to
one at the 7:51 mark of the
first half. The onslaught con-
tinued as the Orangemen zone

tively shut down the Panther

Pitt is now 7-3 (2-1).

Late Come charge not enough 015 Pin‘

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

Last year, the Pitt women’s bas-
ketball team’s offense intermittently
vanished.

Yesterday, at Fitzgerald Field
House, thanks to some slight of
hand in the form of a defensive
adjustment by the Lady Panthers, it
was the Miami Hurricane offense
that disappeared in the second half
of a 71-66 Pitt victory.

The win was the fifth straight for
the Lady Panthers (10-2 overall, 4-0
in the Big East) and their first ever
against Miami (5-6, 2-3).

“I am real proud of this win,” Pitt
head coach Kirk Bruce said. “[The
Pitt players] are playing together
and their attitudes are good. I am a
lucky coach.”

The “lucky coach” made a defen-
sive change at the half that helped
spark a Pitt run.

“In the first half, we were going
back and forth from man to a
zone,” senio.r,f<?rWard Jprzna
Huemrich said. “At. times, we were

confused as to what ldefensel we
were in. In the second half, we just
played our 1-2-2 defense. It really
worked for us.”

After Miami took a one-point
lead on a jump shot by junior for-
ward Tanya Young, Pitt’s defense
reduced the Hurricane attack to a
light breeze, holding Miami to two
points over the next 10-plus min-
utes.

Pitt extended its defense, and
took control of the tempo. The nor-
mally deliberate Hurricane offense
began taking quick shots and
crashing the boards.

“We forced them to turn [the
pace] up a little bit when maybe
they didn’t want to,” Bruce said.

Pitt pulled out to a 16-point lead
before rookie guard/forward
Sheron Murray ended the 19-2 run
with a long jump shot with 8:49
remaining in the game.

“Today proved [how good our
defense isl,” Huemrich said. “We
came out in the second half and
held them._” 4 _  _

gled shooting from the field (31

percent) andthe free throw line (58
percent) throughout the second
half. . 

“Once we got deep into) the sec-
ond half and got the lead up to 16,
I knew that wasn’t going to last,”
Bruce said. 

The Hurricanes got the lead
down to seven on a three point
shot by senior Ronnie McGar1y, but
sophomore guard Stephanie Petho
hit three of four free throws for Pitt
as the Lady Panthers held on for a
five-point victory.

“Last year, we had leads and
teams came back and [beat usl,"
junior point guard Carol Morton
said. “This year we are a better
team. We hold on to a lead.”

Pitt has gotten strong perfor-
mances from reserves all season. 
This time it was Petho who
chipped in 11 points coming off the
bench.

“If Stephanie does not score 11
points in this game, we don’t win,"

 “I trained pretty hard in winter training

Also, the divers swept the diving com-

“I was very surprised we swept the the

The No. 22-ranked Pitt swimming
and diving team rode a hot streak all
the way-to College Park, Pa. to face off
against rival Penn State this weekend.
Pitt won eight out of 13 events, but A
lost the meet 123.5 to 119.5.

What separated Pitt from winning
and losing was a matter of .01 sec-
onds, It didn’t seem like a big deal at
the time when Pitt’s Zach Economos
tied Penn State’s Sean Anderson in the
SO-meter freestyle halfway through the
meet. But at the end of the meet that
.01 seconds was what would’ve given
Pitt five more points and a one—point
victory. —

“I don’t have any excuses other than
we should have been a tad bit sharp-
er,” said Pitt head coach Chuck
Knoles. ,

“Penn State swam really tough, and
they placed well underneath our event
winners. It was an extremely disap-

pointing loss.” The Pitt swimming team won eight events but fell to the PSU Lions in College Park. “Anytime you Can SWiII1 21 meet and

Wrestlers down Lehigh, 24-15

By Dan Lauso
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers wrestling
team returned to action this past
weekend with a much needed
victory over Lehigh University.

The Panthers got back on
track after a disappointing
showing in the Las Vegas
Invitational last December.

In their first dual-meet of the
season, the Panthers easily
defeated the Engineers of
Lehigh University by a score of
24 to 15.

A strong victory after a slow
start could be the spark that
ignites the flame and propels
the Panthers to the successful
season that the team is hoping
for.

After the Vegas invite, head
coach Rande Stottlemyer said,
“We can’t look for excuses, we
have to look for solutions.”

Obviously the Panthers found
some solutions in their impres-
sive showing this past Friday.

Lighter weight divisions jump-
staited the Panther attack and
landed Pitt on the right track
that led to victory. ,

Chris Stevens, wrestling in the
118 lbs. division, started the day
off with a close victory over
Jason Kuntz by the score of 5-4.

By the same score, Eric
Knopsnyder won the 126 lbs.
classification by knocking off
Lehigl1’s Marc Lombardy in the
full time allotment.

The first fall of the afternoon

was turned in by Pitt sopho-
more John Richey. Richey put
away Mark Keller with only 27
seconds remaining in the sec-
ond period of his 134 lbs.
match-up.

The Panthers struggled a bit
in their matches involving the
middle weight classes.

Brett Gould was narrowly
defeated by Chris O’Byrne at
the 142 lbs. class. Gould held
the early advantage through the
first two periods but fell a little
short losing 3-2 in the third peri-
od.

The 150 lbs. division saw

‘ Pitt’s Eric Yanek decisioned by

the Engineers" Brian Strunk.
Yanek fell behind early in the
first period and was never able
to mount a comeback losing 7-3
in the full three periods.

Another tough loss was felt by
the Panther’s John Withrow at
158. Withrow was down 4-0 in
his match to Brian Cipollone
when he mounted a comeback
in the second period to tie the
match 4-4. Unfortunately it
wasn’t in the cards for Withrow
on Friday as he went down
swinging in the third period,
losing 5-4.

The Panthers fought back in
the 167 class with a victory by
Rich Catalano. Catalano domi-
nated Corey Brechbill and even-
tually pinned him near the end
of the first period.

Lehigh made the day’s contest
interesting by winning in the
177 division. Lehigh’s Rick

 

Happ took down Pitt’s Derek
Burgert in the third period to
draw Lehigh close to Pitt. *

» With Pitt in the lead by a nar-
row margin of 18-15, the
Panther’s big guns fired and
secured the Panther victory.

Jeff Kloiber, one of the
Panthers’ and the nation’s top
wrestlers, won a hard fought
match in the 190 lbs. weight
classification. Kloiber deci-
sioned Andy Fitz 4-2 to seal the
victory for the Panthers giving
them an insurmountable 21-15
lead.

The big man for the Panthers,
Pat Wiltanger, closed the day
with a victory in the heavy-
weight class. Wiltanger won 4-2
in sudden death overtime, beat-
ing Bill Closson and making the
final score of the day, Pitt 24,
Lehigh 15.

According to the coaching
staff, the team wrestled well as a
collective whole.

“I think the [dual] match went
very well,” said assistant coach
Scott Hovan. “It was a very
good team effort.

A strong opening victory
could go a long way to helping
the Panthers move up in the
polls and reaching their goal of
a top 15 or better ranking.

Pitt Notes: The Panther
wrestlers were scheduled to
compete against Army,
Princeton, and Manhattan this
past Saturday at Army, but the
match was postponed until
Sunday.

“Those are the kind of
things that make me proud
as a coach. We are continu-
ing to work with the girls
that are non-starters. When
one has to play a bigger role
in one game than they do in
another, we can get a perfor-
mance like this.”

Petho’s one miss from the
charity stripe was only the
second in 27 attempts for the
93 percent foul shooter.

“When Stephanie misses,
we think it is like the end of
the world,” Bruce said. “We
expect Stephanie to make
every [free throwl.”

Pitt shot 62 percent overall
for the line, with some key
iiiisses down the stretch, and
is hitting only 60 percent for
the season.

"‘Free—throw shooting is
always a concern,” Bruce
said. “With the shooters we
have here, there is no way in
the world hat we should be

at 60 percent.”

“'1 think it is just mental,”
Huemrich said. “It is not that
anybody on this team is real-
ly a bad foul shooter. Even
[Morton]  she’s not that
bad of a foul shooter, but she
thinks she is. We just have to
be stronger mentally.”

Despite struggling from
the line, Morton continued to
be a disruptive force on
defense.

She and reserve point
guard Erin Maloy combined
for only eight points, but
dished out 10 assists while
committing only three
turnovers.

Those point guards ran a
balanced attack. Jill
Colabrese, powered by a hot
start from three point range,
matched junior guard Jenine
Joyce for the scoring lead
with 16 points. Huemrich
tossed in 14 points, grabbed
12 rebounds and blocked
three shots.

Wrap-up

Continued from page 11

St. Johns shot Pitt atop the Big
East at 2-0 all by itself, waiting
for the other conference teams
to catch up.

Pitt's four victories in its first
four games meant nothing to
the Mountaineers of West
Virginia University, howeVer,as
they planned on bushwhacking
the visiting Panthers four days
later in a Saturday night show-
down in M.organtown’s WVU
Coliseum — historically a tough
place to play for any team.

From the beginning, the offi-
cials of the Pitt/WVU battle
must have decided they were
not going to let the skirmish get
too physical. The tempo of the
game was never opened up as
the referees called a combined
55 fouls on both teams, and 67
free throws were tossed up as a
result.

The Mountaineers beat the
Panthers by a final score of 99-
91. Pitt lost in spite of Eric
Mobley scoring 24 points and
every Pitt starter except Jerry

 

McCullough scoring in double
figures.

“This was a very significant
win for our club. We had to do
much more tonight than against
any other team we played this
year,” WVU coach Gale Catlett
said following the game.

WVU was led by an attack
from its senior forward Pervires
Green, who led all scorers with
25 points, and 18 points from
sixth man Zane Shaw.

Pitt also committed 28
turnovers, which turned out to
be a big key in the Panther loss.

“We just turned the ball over
too much tonight. Also, Greene
hurt us,” Pitt head coach Paul
Evans said. “We had trouble
matching up with him all
game.”

McCullough was critical of
some of the calls against Pitt.

“We’re not down or anything.
A lot of fouls were called
tonight - some of the fouls
called against us the West
Virginia players should have
gotten Academy Awards for,”

McCullough said. “But we’ll put
this game behind us and move
on.”

The Panthers had one week
off before a grueling schedule
of four games in 10 days would
begin. Fortunately for Pitt, all
four games were being played
in Pittsburgh.

On Dec. 18, the Panthers
lined up against cross-town rival
Duquesne at the neutral site of
the Civic Arena. The crowd was
split, with fans in attendance
being about equal in rooting for
both teams.

The control of the tempo was
also about equal, with
Duquesne forcing the action the
first half and Pitt taking control
in the second half. Fortunately
for the Panthers, when they
took control of the game it was
for good, as Pitt managed to
squash the feisty Dukes, 77-66.

Pitt was led by hot-handed
Orlando Antigua, who scored
20 points, and Mobley scored in
double figures once again with
14.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monda , an

The Dukes were, to no sur-
prise, led by star Derrick Alston,
who led all scorers with 26.

To say “night and day” in
comparing Duquesne with Pitt's
next opponent just two days
later would be an understate-
ment. The Panthers’ next game
was once again at the Civic
Arena as No. 2-ranked North
Carolina came to town to play
Pitt at the Civic Arena. Due to
new seating added to the arena,
:1 Pittsburgh indoor sporting
event attendance record was set
at the game with 17,716 fans
present, which looked good on
ESPN for the city and for Pitt.

The Panthers responded by
giving their fans quite a bit of
excitement as they came on like
wildfire, opening up an 8-0
lead. Pitt also hung tough the
entire first half by ﬂying into the

« locker room only down two,

scoring 45 points while holding
the Tarheels to 47.

The second half was a differ-
ent story, as Eric Mobley got

fouled out with over 11 minutes
left in the second half, leaving
nobody to match up with North
Carolina’s height.

“I wish we had the six—foul
rule this time,” Mobley said after
the game.

As a result, the Panthers just
plain ran out of gas as North
Carolina cruised to a 106-95 vic-
tory that really was not even
that close.

“I don’t think I ever remem-
ber a team that fielded three
seven-footers before. I think our
kids gave a real good effort, but
we just weren’t able to match
up with their size,” Evans said.

Ahmed Shareef had the hot
hand for the Panthers with 19.
Antigua continued his scoring
touch with 18, and Willie
Cauley and Jaime Peterson both
came off the bench to con-
tribute with 13 and 11 points
respectively. But it was not
nearly enough to hold back the
Tarheels, who are picked by
many to repeat as national
champions this season.

North Carolina was led by
Donald Williams with 24 points,
while four other scorers hit dou-
ble figures and 11 of the 12
Tarheel players scored at least
two points.

“We were able to get their big
man in some foul trouble and
that helped us. Our goal was
just to come out of here with a
win, whether it be by only one
point. Our people really expect
us to win,” North Carolina head
coach Dean Smith said.

The Panthers continued to
bounce up and down the
schedule depth chart by lining
up against Robert Morris
College as the Colonials came to
the Fitzgerald Field House two
days later.

The Panthers had to be care-
ful to not get stung by the
Colonials —— a slight worry due
to Pitt getting banged up by the
T arheels just two days earlier.
This time it was the Panthers
who had the clear size advan-
tage  but somebody forgot to
tell that to Robert Morris.

And the Colonials were more
than happy to oblige in a possi-
ble ambush of the Panthers by
playing Pitt tough and coming
back from a 35-21 halftime
deficit. Pitt let an 18- point lead
shrivel up to merely eight points
about half way through the sec-
ond half.

Enter streaky Garrick Thomas
for Pitt, who decided to take
matters into his own hands.
Wliat resulted was five 3-point-
ers frorn that point and a total of
six 5—pointers and made three
free throws for a career-high
total of 21 points for Thomas
and an 80-65 victory for the
Panthers.

“Unfortunately for us, Garrick
Thomas showed up for Pitt. But
I thought we gave a good effort
and played real hard,” Robert
Morris coach Jarrett Durham
said. 7

Antigua was the only other
Pitt player who scored in dou-
ble figures as starting shooting
guard Ahmad Shareef was
absent to attend his grandmoth-
er’s funeral in Chicago.

Steelers

Contcl from page 13

ranked playoff team. _

Former Los Angeles
Raider great Marcus Allen
rumbled for 67 yards on
21 carries and scored the
Chiefs’ second touch-
down. Former Steeler
tight end Keith Cash not
only caught seven passes
for 56 yards, but dealt the
Steelers the most ldeadly
blow of the game — a
blocked punt.

With two—and-a—half
minutes left and the game
seemingly _in hand,
Steeler punter Mark
Royals lined up to punt
the ball back to the
Chiefs, who were down
by seven and were nearly
out of steam.

But Cash ran virtually
untouched through the
Steeler line and deflected
Royals’ punt. Fred Jones
picked it up and took it to
the nine, where Montana
quickly hit Barnett to tie
the game.

“You can’t get a kick
blocked. That’s totally
uncalled for,” Steeler
head coach Bill Cowher
said. “Maybe it typifies the
way this year has gone.”

Entering the game as
45-to-1 underdogs to win
the Super Bowl, the
Steelers threatened to
shock the football world
when they built a 17-7
halftime lead.

After stymieing the
Kansas City offense on
the game’s first posses-
sion, Pittsburgh took the
ball on a nine-play, 66-
yard drive that culminated
in a 10-yard . Neil
O’Donnell pass to tight
end Adrian Cooper.
Running back Merril
Hoge gave the Steelers a
huge lift when he ruin-
bled for 32 yards on a
screen on third-and-17
from their own 41.

After Kansas City tied
the score at seven on a
touchdown ‘pass to ]._I.
Birden from backup quar-
terback Dave Kreig,
Steeler place—kicker Gary
Anderson connected on a
30-yard field goal to give
Pittsburgh back the lead.
Ernie Mills hauled in a 26-
yard pass too with 18 sec-
onds left in the first half to
send Pittsburgh into the
locker room up 17-7.

Lowery hit on a 23-yard
field goal late in the third
quarter to cut the
Pittsburgh lead to one
touchdown, and then
Allen scored on a two-
yard run to tie the game
at 17.

O’Donnell, who threw
for 286 yards, responded
by hitting tight end Eric
Green with a 22-yard pass
to put the Steelers up 24-
17.

Leroy Thompson
rushed 25 times for 60
yards. Hoge. six for 27.

“I was relatively pleased with
our play and the way our kids
pulled together. It’s tough to
play three games in five days,
especially after just playing the
number two team in the country
only two days earlier,” Evans
said.

Pitt’s last game before retum—
ing to Big East play came five
days later on Dec. 27 against
Baltimore’s Coppin 'State
College.

The Panthers started to show
signs of wear in their lackadaisi—
cal play due to the rigorous and
packed schedule. The Eagles
soared into the Field House and

played like wildfire while the
Panthers’ play resembled the
pigeons who watched from the
rafters above the endzone
scoreboard.

Pitt trailed the entire game,
but woke up just in the nick of
time, with nary a minute left to
play. Antigua _ and Sotiris
Aggelou both hit threes with
under two minutes to tie the
game and McCullough stole the
ball and scored to give Pitt its
first lead with 1:09 left. From
there, Pitt outscored the Eagles
6-2 in the last minute to ‘seal up
a 76-70 victory.

“I thpught we played really
