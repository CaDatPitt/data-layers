Equitable Gas Cleared
h In Langley Explosion

BY MREA CSORBA

County Coroner Cyril H. Wecht
cleared the Equitable Gas Company
of criminal negligence in the
Langley Hall explosion at the
conclusion of the coroner’s inquest,
but blasted the utility company for
shipping a ruptured gas line to
Houston to avoid its being
subpoenaed by the coroner’s ofﬁce.

The six-foot damaged section of
the gas line which may. have caused
the January 20 blast that killed two
women was sent to Metallurgical
Corporation in Houston despite
Wecht’-s request to postpone
metallurgical testing on the pipe
until after last week’s inquest.

During the inquest, Equitable’s
lawyer William R. Tighe said he
ignored the coroner’s request and
ordered the shipment to avoid a
possible subpoena which may have
passed the ruptured line on to Pitt.

‘ ‘I gave orders to ship it because I
didn’t want the pipe to end up in the
hands of the other side,” Tighe said
in testimony last Friday. “We
thought the coroner’s ofﬁce might
produce a search and seizure

warrant and force us to turn it over
to Pitt against our wishes.”

“Wecht doesn’t seem as impar-
tia1‘as he should be,” Tighe said,
citing three Pitt schools Wecht is
affiliated with: Pitt’s Medical
School, Dental School and the
Graduate School of Public Health.
Tighe also said he recalled that
Wecht had been in the company of
Pitt investigating ofﬁcials many
times during the investigation
period.

Wecht made the request to detain
shipment of the pipes on Thursday,
February 3. The pipeline was
placed on board an early morning
ﬂight for Houston the next day.

Until then, the damaged pipe
section was on display for
investigating agents to view in
Raymond Testa’s office. Testa is
Equitable’s chief investigator. He
was one of two Equitable gas
representatives barred from a
meeting of investigators convened
by Wecht January 24 to determine
the preliminary cause of the
explosion. -

Wecht said he did not issue

Vacation Day Snowed Out

BY LESLEY SAYELL

Great Americans Day, Monday,
Feb. 21, originally scheduled as a
University holiday, will be sched-
uled as a regular class day as a
make-up opportunity, according to
Secretary of the University, Dr.
Albert C. Van Dusen.

“We’ve taken a positive step-to
have Great Americans Day as a
regular working day in response to
many requests from faculty,”
assistant to the University Secretary
Van Dusen said. “Not only the
Oakland campus, but also regional
campuses have requested that day
be a regular class day in order to
catch up on work that has been
missed due to the emergency
closing at the University because of
the adverse weather and energy
conditions,” he said.

Classes will be held and libraries
and all offices will conduct business
as usual on Feb. 21.

“Students are paying for educa-
tion through classes,” Department

of News and Publications spokes-.

man Mary Lou Burger said. “We
have already missed one day
because of bad weather and another
day of classes was cancelled
because of the energy crisis,” she
said.

The proposed renovations of
Pitt’s residence halls, designed to
ease the University's housing
crunch, will not be as severe as
earlier anticipated, according to
Pitt’s Director of Housing Donovan
Hughes.

Hugheslsaid while major renova-
tions will take place in Holland Hall
South, plans to expand the
occupancy in the McCormick studio
apartmen_ts’hav_e been disgarded.

Student Government Board
(SGB) President Bernie Payne said,
“I’m personally disappointed that
we are not getting Great Americans
Day off because kids have made
plans that are going to have to be
changed.” —

“I’m upset because I was going

home that long weekend, and now I ’

won't be able to go home at all this
term because I live too far away,”
Nancy Bentz, a junior said.

“The students were going to
make it up anyway,” SGB member
Chip Hubbard said. “The.last day
we had off was requested by the
governor, so I think the decision to
have us‘ make up that day is
wrong,” he said. '

Jim Bitzan, a sophomore said,
“There are two reasons why Pitt
should not have classes on Great
Americans Day. First, unlike Dr.
Martin ‘Luther King's birthday
which Pitt had off for, Great
Americans Day is a national
holiday. Second, there will still be a
gas shortage on this day.”

Although another SGB member,
Josh Baylson, disagreed with the
University’ s decision to hold classes
Feb. 21, he said, “I’m glad they are
tacking the day on now instead of
taking it off of our readinglperiod in
April.”

BY DAN ROSENTHAL

More than 150 residents of
Brackenridge Hall have petitioned
the Office of Residence Life (ORL)
and the Housing Ofﬁce for a more
adequate ﬁre-alarm system.

The petition,‘ drawn up by
Brackenridge resident Kathy Bor-
ing, included a survey showing 78
percent of the 206 students in
Brackenridge Hall did not hear an
early-morning fire alarm last
month.

Although the ﬁre alarm was false,

Renovation Plan Altered
For McCormick Rooms

renovations are also scheduled for
the Medical Center Nurses Resi-
dence.

“One room per floor will be
converted from a current triple into
a quad in Holland Hall,” Hughes
said.

The proposed three to four person
increase in McCormick studio
apartments will not occur due to an
anticipated overworking of facilities
that would lower the quality of life in
the dorms, Hughes said.

The University will continue to
keep temperatures in the low 60

degree range as requested by the

governor and the various utility
companies, assistant to the Univer-

sity Secretary Henry Beukema said. ‘

Pitt, of the several colleges and
universities in the Pittsburgh area,
was the only one originally
scheduled to close on Great
Americans Day.

the Brackenridge residents com-
plainedz

——Alarms’ duration is too short.

—Desk attendants.’ evacuation
instructions are garbled and not
repeated enough. , '

—Fire extinguishers frequently
are not in working order.

—Fire doors are not required.
despite maintenance repair re-
quests. .

—Some ﬁre hoses are not
properly coiled.

Donovan Hughes, Housing Ofﬁce
director, said the ﬁre alarm system
was ‘ ‘not meant to be all things to all
people.

“The system was never intended
to physically wake everyone up,
walk them down the stairwell and
out of the building,” Hughes said.

Some students have a misconcep-

tion that the ﬁre-alarm system is J, "  7

one large unit, according to
Hughes.

The ﬁre bells, smoke detectors,
alarm tones and evacuation inter-
coms are all separate parts of the
system, he said.

John Miller, maintenance super} A
visor, said the ﬁre bells were a ;__
installed in 1956 and “back then, V  

probably weren't intended to get
everyone out of bed.” '

“But what we can do,” Miller

said, “is alter some of the newer
equipment. The smoke detector

“The alarm tone is set now to

' soundfor about 40 seconds,” Miller

said. “We’ll up that to between two
and three minutes. ’ ’

When an alarm ‘sounds in
Brackenridge. Amos. Holland or
McCormick, desk attendants read
evacuation instructions over an
intercom.

“We'll also look into the
possibility of investing in more
speakers to better reach those
students in far-end rooms.”

Fire hoses, doors and extinguish-
ers in Brackenridge have been

Miller added.

“When we receive a complaint,
we’ll check it out. though,” he said.

Both Hughes and Miller said
input from students is justified and
welcome. '

Fred Fonseca, director of the
ORL, said he told Boring in a letter
that he has been aware of some of
the needed changes in the fire alarm
system, not only in Brackenridge
but in the other dorms as well.

“We have in our procedures that
our staff (of resident assistants) aids
students in evacuation when an
alarm sounds,” Fonseca said.

Wecht Blasts Equitable CASCOUn

For Shipping Pipe Line

(Continued from Page 1)-

invitations to the two Equitable
investigators for the meeting
because Equitable was an involved
party.

In his ruling statement following
the inquest’s testimony, Wecht
lashed out at Equitable’s accusation
of collusion. The coroner's inquest
was “moved by no one. No one
pulled us along. It is we who moved
those around us,” Wecht said.

Wecht also scolded the utility
company for removing an unclaim-
ed, empty gas line which ran
parallel to the damaged main
without notifying proper authorities
of its existence.

Wecht ruled the blast accidental
however, and said natural gas was
the most plausible cause.

“It is not absolutely or scientifi-
cally concluded here that methane
was there before the blast, but the
ﬁnding of methane in Carleen
Curry’s lung tissue and blood
makes evidence strong for its
presence.

“Knowing methane can only be
breathed in anti-mortem (before
death), and since the blast injuries
suffered by Curry left her in no
condition to breath it in afterwards,
results indicate a natural gas
explosion.” Wecht did not

ﬁnd Equitable Gas Company guilty
of criminal negligence because the
company had tested that pipe for
leaks as late as December 1976.

Wecht said the blast may have
been sparked by the lighting of a
match or the turning of a light
switch. Curry, 37 of Shadyside, was
a smoker. It was also reported
during the inquest that the
electrical power in Crawford Hall,
shut off during the installation of a
transformer, was switched back on
one to three minutes before the
explosion.

“AC is attractive to students

Temple News Nabs Market

A Philadelphia Newspaper Guild
strike which has crippled the area’s
three major newspapers has
prompted the Temple University
student newspaper to expand its
circulation and increase coverage of
city, state and national news.

A strike of about 840 editorial and
business employes at the Philadel-
phia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily
News went on strike Tuesday in a
dispute over wages and medical
beneﬁts.

The third city daily, the
Philadelphia Bulletin, has been
forced to sell copies over the counter
because Newspaper Guild pickets of
the building forced a stop to home
deliveries by Teamster truck drivers
and members of other crafts unions

SGB Adopts

New Student

Regulations

Regulations restricting student
behavior within the Student Gov-
ernment Board's (SGB) ofﬁce
complex in the Student Union were
passed by the new SGB last week
during an unscheduled, informal
and unpublicized meeting.

The regulations prohibit students
visiting the SGB offices from using
profanity, smoking cigarettes in the
executive office, putting their feet
on furniture, laying on desks and
laying on the couch, especially
asleep.

Students must have the permis-
sion of the SGB secretary or special
clearance by an SGB member
before he or she is allowed to enter
the SGB executive office.

_ Use of the SGB’s telephones by
students is also restricted. A sign
above the telephone in the SGB
secretary’s office prohibits students
from making personal phone calls,
especially if the student is not a
member of a standing SGB
committee or student organization.

The new SGB members also
established their first long-range
goal. Before their term expires next
year. the SGB would like to" hold a

into living quarters, an idea
proposed by the Resident Student
Association (RSA). ‘
“We’re not completely ecstatic
about the new policy, but it’s_ more
of a compromise,” RSA chairman
Michele Sikora said. _
Sikora and Hughes said the RSA
will be working closely with the
Housing Office on the Holland Hall
renovations.
“We’re planning on making the
-quad furnishings as attractive as
possible,” Hughes said. “The
students will have what every other
student has in terms of furnishings.
I asked Michele to identify a
committee of her peers to get
together with me within the next
30-40 days. Ishave the lay-outs and
plans. I’m asking for their input.”
Estimations of costs for the new
renovations were not available,

although in January, Hughes
estimated costs would run between

’ $63,000 to $72,000.

The renovations, which were
originally to add 124 beds to the
dorms, were being undertaken in
part, Hughes said, because of the

uncertaintylof a renewed housing

contract with Hotel Webster . Hall
and a halt in plans to turn Bruce Hall
into a student residence.

Since then Hughes said the
negotiations have begun with Hotel
Webster Hall for the fall term and
that a new_ contract may be possible.

belt tightening is needed for better
academic performance. “But this
program does yield new insight to
life. I feel the good points here
outweight the bad ones,” he said.

He explained AC offers excellent
programs in, for example, special
education and working with the
handicapped.

Stephanie Flom, a former AC
student, feels the best part of AC is

the new freshman-sophomore pro- '

gram. “This will help students

because they can join AC after their.
ﬁrst year in the University,” she

said. ‘ ‘I feel the continuation of the

program will recruit more students

by appealing to a greater diversity

of students,” she said.

 Guaranteed Alternatives

1.

1.  College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) Council’s approval and

 incorporation of the Alternative Curriculum (AC) as an integral part of
 CAS is a step forward in creating an undergraduate atmosphere where
“:2 learning is emphasized and choice is available.

 Often institutions of higher learning become budget-oriented instead

.i;‘ofstudent-option-oriented. Students are then faced with piling up their
120 credits by the same old tried and true methods.
1‘ These methods give one a degree, but little chance to take part in the

 process. At times they offer little more than insight into

test-passing skills.

. Continued opposition to AC merely because few students take
advantage of it is a stand that does not reﬂect an educationally inspired
spirit. Instead, it reeks of a survival of the ﬁttest doctrine where the
biggest departments that return the most immediate beneﬁts to the

' ' University get the most support.

lfAC is not attracting enough students, then its base of appeal can be
 But it must be broadened without diluting its educational

A effectiveness or defeating its purpose by returning it to the same oid

educational conﬁnes. .
 Some within AC admit the need. for belt-tightening to eliminate
 programs. But it should be done with discretion. For there is
a ﬁne line between belt-tightening and restricting AC from exercising-
the altﬁmatives it was created to.pr0vi_de.   ‘ 2  A ' i*:":. -  " ' "1:

_ Those involvediwith AC fought hard during its four-year probationary
period to maintain an excellence that would insure its permanent
acceptance. Acceptance does not mean this ﬁght is over, however.
Eccellence is not maintained by keeping the status quo. It is a constant

 AC’sjob is not to provide a formula for alternative education. The job
is to give direction to students who want to- identify their educational
goals and take an active part in achieving them. '

Warren and Lorraine

BY TOM WASELESKI

“Come on, Warren, eat it.” A
 “You shot-1ldn’t’-ve had those
eggsithis morning, =Warren.”,

' ~ ‘'‘If his mouth is..full,- Lorraine,
shove it through his nose.” ~ .- 

“You want that hundred bucks,
don’t- you, Warren? Eat!’-’

“Come on, Lorraine, Warren can
hold more than that. Fold the pizza
and shove it hard.’.’ . .

“Move-your feet, Warren, it'll go
down easier. Thataboy.”

“Don't mind his color, Lorraine,
make him eat!”

The air smelled of decay. Maybe
just the cheese. Or perhaps the
intermittent burping of 20 people
lured into gorging themselves on
cafeteria pizza by the $175" prize
money. ‘

Judges,‘ timekeeper, scoreboard
and play-by-play. Nothing slipshod
in America’-when it comes to sport, a
tribute to a sense of fair‘ play. The
contest ofﬁcials from the Resident
Student Association and Student

' Food Committee looked on Satur- O

day to see that their $175 would be
justly awarded. In the meantime,
meal plans are going up 2 percent,“
and it's doubtful so manystudent
judges sat in on that bonanza.

“Attaboy, Warren. You win and
I'll buy you a pizza tonight.”

“Don’t slow down now, Warren,
you were just getting good. Make
him eat, Lorraine.”

The decay pervaded as trays upon
trays of pizzawere hustled in. The
odor was scarcely noticeable. The
faces chomped on the gooey dough,
tasteless by now. The red slop
dripped from several chins and
water glugged down the throats of
others as if to force the pizza down,
down to where there'd be room for a
hundred bucks.

IMPRESSIONS ‘

Decay hung over the Student
Union Ballroom Thursday, too.
This time not food, but drink. A
beer “festival,” they called it. And
what is a beer festival if not a
celebration of the golden, foamy
stuff? A scant one dollar for 10
glasses——where in the world!

A ritual to honor the god that
ﬂows from the tap, and toast and
chug him with yankee gusto of a
20-pound-overweight pizza wolfer.
The ballroom was wall-to-wall with
the sour stench of spilled heads and
salty potato chips ground under-
foot.

Can the fest be concealed in the
seeming excuse to hold a beer
tasting-program. where a frat party
vet can buy 10 tastesfora buck,

. then cough (or belch) up another

There’s little point in trying to
obscure _motives. ,,They came,
plainly and"'sifnply, to show their
‘love for beer, their lust for it, as if it ‘
were ,.a virtue or an achievement.

J They came to swallow it and wallow

in it, douse themselves and their
friends in it. b .
The vastness of the ballroom
opening into the Kurtzrnan room
was easily overcome by_the decay
and the sweat. It could’ have been
an intimate Roman bath in 300 AD
or, a more recent version, the
sweltering German cabarets of the
l930’s. _ ~ ,
The rot dwelled ’on’1the' breath of
women who sloshed the sour sauce
over their chins. And men unrolled

The Joys of Crossing

BY VINCE ROBERTSON .

Since the Dept. of City Planning’s
report (Pitt News, Feb. 9) has been
released, the fact that the Oakland
area has been ranked number three
in traffic density should come as no
surprise to anyone who has had to
drive in it or walk from one curb to
the other. Oakland’s traffic can be
in a word terrifying. ‘

The University, not oblivious to
this problem, has to be commended
for a recent project which has
eliminated some of the terror and
danger of crossing one of the main
traffic arteries. The project I am
referring to is the building of the
bridge that spans Forbes Avenue
and connects the dorm area with the
new academic and research com-
plexes already built or still i.
progress.

There have been times when I
have used the bridge as the only
quick means of getting across

Forbes Avenue. There were times .

when the bridge was the only logical
and safe way of crossing Forbes;

‘And there were times when I took

Standing in the center of the part
that spans Forbes, I would watch
the traffic that could no longer
disturb me and watch the antics of
the desperate or hurried pedes-
trians trying to negotiate a street
crossing down at the danger level.

I would gloat over the conven-
ience I was enjoying at the time and
softly utter to myself, “Ah, now this
is nice; this is real nice. This is more
like it!” I would consciously but
silently notice additional conven-

. ience. The bridge, being enclosed.

protected me from the elements-
primarily strong winds. I couldn’t
lose any of my belongings and,
equally important, passing pedes-

trians and trafﬁc were safe from

accidental or intentional missles. I
thought what a thoroughly enjoy-
able convenience, too bad all
thruways aren't equipped as such.

I often hear people complain of i

the treacherous art of trying to cross
Bigelow Blvd. between Fifth and
Forbes avenues. I often find myself

Monday, February  1977-“-THE NEWS:-Page'l5'i‘T 

Letters to the Editor

 

Chancellor Had

Gambler’s Luck

My letter concerns the -irrespon-
sible manner in which the
University of Pittsburgh adminis-
tration handled the storm and fuel
situation earlier this month.

On January 27, at 7:30 p.m.,
Pennsylvania Governor Milton
Shapp broa-dcasted a special
emergency message concerning the
energy crisis. During his announce-

' ment he explained the current fuel

‘F

situation and warned of a cold front
and psosible blizzard conditions
that were approaching our area. He
then asked all non-essential busi-
neses to close, as the state school
system had done a day earlier, and
for other essential businesses to
shorten theirihours and turn down
their thermostats. As KDKA-TV
said immediately following the

announceinent, the governor’s

message also concerned colleges
and universities.

Later that evening, after many
Pitt students had made alternate
plans to either return home or to
prepare for the oncoming blizzard,
it was announced on television that
classes would be held as usual at
Pitt.

At first my reaction was selﬁsh. I
had already made plans to return
home for the crisis, and thus my

4? ﬁplans had to be postponed. After I

‘O

to

as

iv

‘gr.

recovered from my selﬁsh reaction,
though, I looked at the situation
rationally and came up with this.
1) Although.Pitt, as I understand,
mainly uses coal to heat . its
buildings, I thought the University
should cooperate with the gover-
nor’s plea, if just to show an

A example to the community. After-

all, University personnel are
supposedly more enlightened than
the average citizen, at least that is
what I have been told.

2) The overwhelming majority of
students at Pitt are commuters. If

the "fuel crisis 'was not serious.

enough to cancel classes, the safety
of the school’s commuters, consid-
ering the oncoming blizzard, should
have been. Apparently the
adihinistration thought otherwise,
if they thought at all.

Despite these two excellent
reasons, and probably a number of
other good ' reasons to cancel
activities, somebody in the Univer-
sity made the decision, or
non-decision, to conduct classes.

At a time when some leadership
was called for, when a decision had
to be made, no one stood forwardto
take the responsibility. In an
emergency situation, it seems to
me, the Chancellor is the person
who must take the initiative. He is

the person who must weigh the pros
and cons and decide whether one
day of classes is as important as
endangering the life of even one
student or employe of the
University, let alone 10,000 plus.

Although I believe the adminis-
tration failed to act in a responsible
manner concerning the fuel shor-
tage, I cannot dictate to the
University how they should act in a
statewide emergency. But, as a
concerned commuter, I do object
vehemently to the lackluster way in
which student and employe lives
were treated.

The blizzard was no surprise. As
early as Wednesday it’ was
forcasted.

Luckily, as far as I know, no
students or employes were injured
in the frantic rush from Oakland at
noon on Friday. The Chancellor
gambled with 10,000 lives and won.
But will he and the students and
employes of the University be as
fortunate next time? How lucky do
you feel, Chancellor Posvar?

Press Biased
Towards Curry

Pittsburgh Press coverage of the
University of Pittsburgh explosion
has displayed prejudice against
black victim. Carleen Curry, and
against black people as a race.

The Press ran‘ a front page lead
story about the white blast victim,
Patricia Hostetler, while hardly
recognizing Mrs. Curry. Mrs.
Curry’s picture appearedon A-14
three days" after the blast.

Miss Hostetler was memorialized
in a compassionate, human story
about her and her boyfriend. The
only statement about Mrs. Curry,
before Sunday, concerned methane
gas found in her body. A close
friend of Mrs. Curry commented,
‘ ‘the Press treated Carleen as if she
was a lab specimen.”

To add ﬁnal insult to injury, the
Press omitted the name of James
Dobbins, a close friend of Mrs.
Curry’s, from the program of the
Heinz Chapel memorial service.
Mr. Dobbins sang a _Negro spiritual
at the service.

The Press’s coverage has made
the black victim appear less
important than the white victim.
This is insulting, and an apology or
explanation is called for.

The Plight Of
Junior Sports

The plight of the Pitt hockey team
is well known to anyone who reads
the Pitt News, and I for one would
like to know when our gracious
University Athletic Department,

. under the “direction” of Casimir J.

Myslinski is going to realize that
there is more to the program than
just football and basketball.
Granted, the football team is
number one in the country, but
anyone who has been here for ﬁve
years knows that it didn't just
happen overnight (and without
substantial increase in funds). A
Then we come to the basketball
team. A budget 100 times greater
than one that could amply cover the
hockey team, yet the record of the
« basketball team doesn't even come
close to that of the hockey team.

Being a_ member of the soccer
team (which, by the way, has varsity
status) I know the problems of being
a “second-class” Pitt athlete. Our
budget last year was one-ﬁfth that
of what‘-'th'e_ football team spent on
athletic tape alone! I think it's
about time that Cas, Walter
Cummins and all the rest of our
friends in the Field House come to
the realization that in order to have
aﬁrst-rate athletic department, you
can’t just be a two sport school.

A lack of response from the
athletic department could only
mean one or two things: either they
don't read the Pitt News‘ or they
don’t really give a damn. Take your
pick.

Fortunate Soul  
Recounts Tale

Last month I was making job
applications out to several hospitals
in the area in attempt to ﬁnd a job
with my microbiology degree that I
hope to’ receive in April. On
January 17 I went over to Hillman
library to duplicate those applica-
tion forms before I sent them out.
Fortunately for me, I left one of my
application forms in the photocopier
machine. I left the library and
walked back to the Towers and
picked up my mail before going to‘
lunch. In it, I found a letter from a
friend from whom I borrowed a book
this summer, who was requesting
that I send it back to him as he
needed it for a class he was going to
teach.

It was 11:30 when I started
wrapping his package and writing a
brief note (which turned out to be
two pages) to send to him. lﬁnished
the package and decided to mail it
and my applications out. It was then
that I noticed that one of my forms
were missing and that I must have
left it at the library. During this
time of disappointment in myself for
being so forgetful, I neglected to
look at my calendar on which I had
written, “Library book due at
Langley today.”

I went down and mailed» the
package, ate a quick lunch, and
rushed off to Hillman to pick up my
form. When I walked back out of the
library and headed toward my class
in Langley, I noticed a siren on an
unmarked car (one "of the magnetic
ones they stick on the roof): The car
was turning off Forbes Ave. on "to
Bigelow. By the time I reached the
Cathedral, the streets were full Of

«sirens. It was then that :1
noticed that the lecture hall and the
library had blown up.

I could have been there and I am

thing. If it was not for our great God
and Savior, Jesus Christ, I would
not be here writing this letter to you
today. I thank God I am alive and I
pray that you do too. I only feel bad

that for many people it takes aw

traumatic incident to make us

realize how fortunate we are to be '

alive.

Amplifying that New,

Distorted Stereo Lingo

For many students, a stereo is a major purchase—for most, their first.
In an increasingly sophisticated stereo world, the unsuspecting and
ill-informed buyer can easily pay through the ears for a mistake, often on
the installment plan.

This story is the first in a three-part series by Dave McDonald that will
attempt to give you the means with which to arm yourself before doing
battle with local audio salesmen. Today’s article deals with the audio
lexicon. Part two will try to help you decide what best suits you and your
budget. The ﬁnal installment will document a tour of local stereo

r

  
    
 

outlets.

BY DAVE McD()NALD

Power, impedance, rumble,
tracking error, capture area; these
terms sound like words you might
hear in a military strategy meeting,
but they actually are words a
salesperson will hit you with at an
audio store.

As with any other product, it's
necessary to know what the
salesperson is talking about in order
to make a wise purchase. If you’re
like most people buying audio
products for the first time, you'll go
into the audio store knowing very
little about the whole stereo jungle.

I can remember just agreeing
with everything the salesman said
and rolling my eyes in wonder at
what he was talking about during
my first stop when searching for a
stereo. After I left the store, I had to
have someone who knew something
about audio systems explain what
the salesman was talking about.

The question going through my
mind was, “what happened to the
days when all you needed to know
about audio were things like AM
and FM, Hi Fi, loud and
extra-loud?" Sometime in tye 60s,
something changed. The good old
hi-fi was phased out and replaced by

component, pre-packaged and inte-
grated systems. Along with these
new systems came the new audio
lingo.

Not wanting to be ignorant on my
second trip to find the stereo that
was right for me, I checked out some
of the new stereo lingo. Like all
beginners, I started with the very
basics.

The workings of audio equipment
can be separated into three main
stages:

1) Music or sound from records or
tapes is reproduced or received by
such devices as turntables, tape

recorders of receivers. 2) The
signals pass through an ampliﬁca-
tion and control unit. 3) There
emerge electrical signals that can
be heard through speakers or
headphones.

/ In the first stage of sound
reproduction, a good turntable is
essential. There are three kind of
turntables: direct-drive, belt-

driven and ratio-driven. The
‘direct-drive turntable will probably
cost the most of the three, but it is
quieter, with little ﬂutter or rumble.
This type of turntable gets its name
because the motor is in direct
contact with the turntable.

The second type of turntable, the
belt-driven model, is very similar to
the direct-drive except the motor
drives a belt to turn the turntables
-platter.

The ratio-driven turntable is the '

least expensive style of the three,
with a lower quality since the platter
is turned by a camshaft that is
driven by gears.

Turntables come in three models,
affecting the convenience of the
machine’. The ﬁrst model is the
automatic turntable, which can play
a number of records in a row without
help from the user.

The semi-automatic will stop or
replay the same record, but it won't
flip down the next record. ~

Taking Valentine ’s Day One Step Too Far

Cassandras have been prophesying marriage’s demise for years now,
but modern lovers ignore them, staunchly propping up the institution
with contracts, marriage manuals and do-it-yourself ceremonies.

lt’s been praised as “the holy state of matrimony” and the “bliss of
marriage," but also blasted as “Hell on earth” or “the worst mistake of

' my life.”

Each year more American couples, stunned by Cupid's arrow, agree
to love, honor and share the fuel bills.

The marriage rate crept timidly upwards in 1976 for the first time in
three years, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.

Sadly though, blissful marriage doesn't seem so blissful in the face of
steadily increasing divorce rates. One in 2.5 marriages end in divorce
and the rate has grown from 4.9 to 5.4 per 1,000. American couples.’

The following is not a report on marital statistics and will not address
the shaky state of the union. it is, however, a modest account of two
innocents and their foray into the wedded wilderness.

BY MAGGIE McKAY AND
BOB PELLEGRINI

The wedding ceremony is but the
tip of the matrimonial iceberg.
Below the dark waters of marriage
lie pre-nuptial courtesies such as
blood tests for syphillis. physicals.
marriage licenses. honeymoon
reservations and other things that
cause sane couples to elope. This
story involves a trial run through
those straits.

A You cangett

We are of the opinion that
marriage before age 25 (at the very
least. 22) is foolhardy. So the
thought of pretending to be an
engaged couple appealed to our
sense of humors only in that neither
of us could imagine being engaged
to. or even steadily dating. the
other.

Could we stand before a minister
or a Justice of the Peace, promising
to love ‘til death us do part. without
a snicker or a sign of panic? Could
we manage to face clerks in jewelry

xi‘

 

stores, trying on wedding barfds in a
sincere manner?

The possibility of comic situations
were endless and we dwelled on
them at length.

Not content with faking the
wedding procedure up to and
excluding the “I do’s,” we sprang
the news of our engagement,
drawing a few chuckles and many
gasps. “Congratulations, you
suckers” was the oft-heard reply.

That joke soon wore thin.
However, Bob became swept away
in the spirit of things.

“Why stop at just getting
married," he said. “We could
make this an ongoing series and
report on having children."
Maggie eyed him suspiciously and

with some alarm.

"Then. after that. we could get
divorced, or better yet. you can die
from some deadly disease and leave
me to play the field," Bob said,
waving his hands »-wildly in
enthusiasm.

50meh0W. his scenario did not
capture his partner's imagination.
If anyone was getting written out of
the Script. it wouldn't be the female
partner.

Bob was pulled down to earth
gently.

When we started planning the
wedding, we decided to go ﬁrst
class; a reception and dinner at an‘
expensive hotel, gowns and tuxedos
for the whole wedding party and a
long honeymoon.

The 'honeymoon,(blush) is" the
treasured time when a couple
reveals its most intimate secrets. It
is also a time to go bankrupt.

We weighed the advantages of

(Continued from Page 8)
large weddings, small weddings,
dry weddings, cheap weddings and
honeymoons at Puerto Vallarta
(Where, Bride magazine said, “The
Burtons were the best known
gringos on the gulch”), the

' Wickenburg Inn tennis and guest

ranch in Arizona (“Make your
honeymoon a love match”) and the
local Innuendo Inn (“A cheap
marriage deserves a cheap start”).

There are many travel services '

that will help the young couple pick
the best places to go on a
honeymoon. A gruff travel service
employe, when told you want a
honeymoon package, will suddenly
become your friend.

He will beam from ear to ear and
call you by your first name, instead
of “hey kid.” He is ecstatic, of
course, to ﬁnd “a live one.”

A We found that travel agencies are
nefarious demons whose only goal
is to sell your soul to the credit
collection agencies.

We pondered the dhoice of a
perfect honeymoon spot. First
choice went to the British Isles, with
Nova Scotia a close second choice.

It turned out that it is actually
possible for a two-week -trip to the
British Isles to cost under $1000-
provided you don’t eat and don’t
mind living in the London subway
system at night. To be really
comfortable would cost substan-
tially more.

That left Nova Scotia, with its
thundering waves and intimate
cottages. Oddly enough, the travel
agency hesitated tosend us to Nova
Scotia. .

“When are you planning your
honeymoon?” an elderly agent
asked.

“Oh, about the end of Feb-
rua_ry,” we replied.

“We don’t.- offer honeymoon
specials for that time of year. It gets
really cold up there.” _

“Oh, that’s okay. Does it really
matter on a honeymoon?” we
asked. .

In the end, we found out that you
can have a decent $1000 honeymoon
as long as you don’t leave the
Western Hemisphere.
going anywhere else, you had better
double that.

There are many hotels in the
Poconos that specialize in pleasing
the newly married. These
honeymoon havens offer such
goodies as heart-shaped bathtubs
with televisions next to them (why is
anyone’s‘ guess) and heart-shaped
beds. M

They even have photographers
who will take pictures of the groom
carrying the bride over the
threshold, throwing her on the bed
and slowly undressing, her...and
after that it’s up to your discretion.
There is a question of taste involved
here, but you can always prove that
a marriage was consummated by
photographing the honeymoon.

The next thing we thought about
was the wedding reception itself. Of
course, we wanted the best we could
get. At one place, the room rental
was enough for a down payment on
a yacht. The cheapest dinner was $6
a plate and the booze would cost $18
a bottle; With a small wedding of
only 100 people, the cheapest
wedding reception this place

' offered was well over $3,000.

We lowered our sights_a little and
started looking at ﬁre halls and

, VFW posts. ‘~ The ﬁre halls aren't

really that bad, if you don’t mind
tobacco-stained pool tables in the
middle of the dance ﬂoor-although
the shiny brass poles coming down
from the next floor are kind of cute.

The VFW posts are okay, too, if you
like pinball machines and juke-
boxes that only play polkas.

Without much reluctance, we
decided to skip all the wedding
traumas and opted for the
college-student wedding without
frills—cheap and simple.

The student affair does not
consist merely of an impulsive visit
to the .I.P. in the wee hours of the
morning. The blood tests and
applying for a license take a few
weeks. Unfortunately, they do cost
money.

Our main objective was to spend
as little money as possible. We
decided to try the University for the
pre-marital blood test and physical.
This, to our dismay,‘ was not
covered by the health fee, but it was
still cheaper than what a local doctor
would charge.

Blood tests at the service were
$2.50 apiece and the accompanying
physical examinations were $3.50
each. Marriage licences go for the
tune of $10. Total expenditures add
up to $22.

At the Health Center, the fact
that we needed a pre-marital test
held up the line (more forms have to
be ﬁlled out) and we drifted off to

Selecting a Stereo;
.Know the Language

(Continued from Page 8)
The third type of turntable is the

_ manual, which is very inconvenient

unless you enjoy playing disc
jockey. With the manual you have
to start and stop every record
yourself.

In stage one of the audio
equipment you may also want to
look into the three different types of
tape players. The best sound
reproduction in tapes comes from
reel-to-reel. The reel-to-reel is a
very natural sound reproducer, but

it is very expensive and more

cumbersome. V

The cassette tape recorder also
has very good reproduction and is
easier to use.

The 8-track tape recorders aren’t
quite as good as the other two; they
have more distortion because of the

. tracks.

The tuner or receiver is the third
component of stage one. This is the

piece of equipment that picks up the
radio stations in your area—and
other areas, possibly, depending on
how good the receiver is. A’ receiver
is often judged by hertz (Hz), which
is a measure of frequency at which
the receiver can deliver the stated
Hz can be measured in a

power.
range from 20 to 20,000. The
broader the measurement, the

better; the low range picks up the
deep bases and the high range
furnishes the trebles. _

The second stage of sound
equipment concerns the pre-ampli-
ﬁer or control center and the

' amplifer (or power amp). A system

may be integrated—a combination
of the two. The pre-amp is the part
of the stereo system that has all the
jacks into which you can plug all
your other components. The
ampliﬁer or power amp’s job is to
increase the strength of the signals
fed it from the pre-amplifier.

 

The third important stage /in
sound reproduction, and the one
that brings the music to your ears, is
the loud speakers or headphones.
Some familiar terms with speakers
are woofers and tweeters. The
woofers are the larger speakers in
the cabinet that can really bring out
the base sounds. Woofers come in
sizes that generally range up to 12
inches. Tweeters, on the other
hand, are smaller—and bring out
the ﬁne points in the music, such as
bells.

Headphones come in two styles——-
the dynamic driver and the
electrostatic. The dynamic driver is
like having mini-loud-speakers in
your ears. The electrostatis
headphones are more expensive,
but have higher accuracy.

Other features in stereo products
are phonographic needles. There
are two types of needles-the

magnetic and the ceramic, or
diamond. 'The magnetic is more
sensitive and picks up higher and
lower sound waves than the ceramic
needle. The diamond needle tends

. to wear down records more easily.

Three important terms should
also be familiar before you make
your trek to the audio store. These
are the terms used to describe the
performance of the sound equip-
ment. Distortion is the term used
when measuring changes in the
music generated by the equipment
before it is passed on to the listener.
The better the equipment, the lower
the distortion; a measurement of .5
or less is very good.

Frequency response is also an_

oft-used term of the stereo
salesperson. This is the ability of

. the sound equipment to reproduce

correctly all frequenceis (or tones in

music) within a certain range of

Once outside the Service,‘ the

The nurse in each case was very
sweet and concerned (speaking in
that tone of voice reserved for

babies and engaged couples). The I

began to have second thoughts.
Suppose something happened and
,we wound up really married. The
thought was too ghastly to
contemplate.

Parental remarks also added
weight to our fears. First of all, our
folks argued, when we applied for a
marriage license, our names would
appear in the local Pittsburgh
paper. And how wouldlthey explain
that to Aunt Sophie?

“Just tell her it's a joke," we
said.

“Do you think she'll really
believe that? And what about your
friends?" We had to admit they had
a point. It seemed, all of a sudden,
to be too much trouble to boﬂier.

Multi—Media Beatles:
’A Waste of Words’

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

If you’re kicking yourself for
missing the multi-media production
of “The Beatles: Away With
Words,” which played at the Syria
Mosque this past weekend, stop
immediately before you hurt
yourself. You didn't miss that
much.

“Away With Words”——hyped as
the “ultimate” multi-media trip———
has it's moments, but if you know
anything at all about the Fab Four
(you'd have to be from Mars not to,
you know as much now as the show
could have told you.

“Away With Words” isn’t a rock
film in the same category as such

dog films as “Pink Floyd,”
“Yessongs” or ‘.‘Gimme Shelter.”
It's deﬁnitely multi-media.

The show features the world’s
largest 36 degree sound system, 29
slide projectors and four movie
projectors.

These expensive technical tools
proceed to ﬂash onto a 45-foot
screen footage and slides of rockers
from the 50’s, the political big-shots
of the 60’s and, of course, the
Beatles, traced through various
stages of their careers. All of this is
set to a musical back-drop of their
most popular songs. .

The effect is start1ing—for at
least 20 minutes. The footage from

The Beatles were the subject of a multi-media show entid ‘,tThe

weekend. Technically impressive, the show offered little insight into
one of music’s greatest influences beyond what is already commonly

ELECTRONIC MUSIC IN
THREE PITT CONCERTS

As part of its concert program,
the University of Pittsburgh's music
department will present three
concerts of electronic music in

' February and March, the first to be

presented tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. at

i Frick Fine Arts Auditorium.

Traditional instruments, such as
the string bass, will occasionally be

i«_ utilized for the concerts and played
V with electronically generated tapes.

Much of the music for the
concerts was composed by either
synthesizer or computer synthesis
at centers for new music in both the
United States and Europe.

Three Pitt composers will have
pieces on the series. They are
Robert Morris, who directs the
University’s electronic music stu-

’ dio, A. ,Wayne Slawson and Otto

Laske.

“Greasepaint”, a musical fan-
tasy of sorts, concerns the opposing
wills of two men: the dominating,
well-reﬁned Sir played by Doug
Farrell; and Cocky, the submissive,
vulgar, cockney sort played by
Barry Brunetti. They are constantly
involved in a literal game—the
stage being the playing board——that

Sir always wins due to his control _

over a group of Urchins and his
making up of the rules as he goes
along. Throughout the game Cocky
is insulted, humiliated and starved.

As should be with every musical
fantasy, “Greasepaint” is replete
with a dragon slaying, a hat and
cane dance, and songs aplenty.

A good many of the songs are
delivered by Brunetti whose
renditions of “The Joker” and “It
Isn't Enough" are sincere and
powerful even though at other times
his voice betrays him. Doug Farrell
maintains the- dignity of his
character throughout the play even

  

under emotional; mess or while pr

  
   

hopping around with one foot in his
hand. His delivery of the songs is
consistently restrained. And, after
so many songs, the restraint begins
to wear on the ears.

Most important while mentioning
the two male leads is the way they
work so well together. Their lines,
their digs at one another, are well
timed and comfortably spoken.

“My Way,” their duet, works so
well because of this ‘terrific timing.
Still, their performance is at
times over~shadowed by Martha
Gronsky as the spunky ill-mannered
kid with a cockney accent that even‘
a Professor Higgins would score.
Her rebelliousness and penchant
for the sting of the truth breaks up

parts of the play that could’

otherwise be dead. \ She even has a
nose that seems bred for the part.

Gronsky’s talent has company.
Rosemary Gleeson gives a graceful
dance and Beverlee Kasdorf shows
off a strong voice in “My First Love
Song,” sung with Cocky.

The colorfully dressed urchins,
all nine of them, are nothing short of
loveable as they mingle in. the
audience. And hats off to
Charmagne Gargaro who choreo-
graphed their dance numbers.

Unfortunately, the urchins’
voices do not equal their dance.
They carry some cumbersome vocal
deadweight through many of the
numbers. Also, the nine piece

a orchestra drags and the members

occasionally lose one another. A
few—piece ensemble might do the
job more efﬁciently.

Overall, the play is delightful and
refreshing, but it seems to go on
nearly forever. At intermission the
audience glanced over their pro-
grams, bracing themselves for the
number of songs yet to come. The
voices are just not talented enough
to make all of the nearly 20 songs
interesting. A song eliminated or
shortened here or there would make
the energy of the play more compact
and potent.

Still in this dreary winterleven if
we're hit with an overdose, it

certainly is,._uice.p;o..s_g, delight_‘ed.,A...

Of World's Folklore

BY DENISE DAILEY

Livia Drapkin, a woman of dance
and song, and Bill Vanaver, singer,
songwriter, versatile instrumenta-
‘list, are two who have traveled.
They/have been to Greek villages,
through the Bulgarian and Russian
countryside‘ and to our own
Appalachian Mountains and Geor-
gia Sea Islands. And once in these
places, they continue to travel the
artist’s path back into the origins of
each region’s music and dance.

This weekend at the Chatham
College Theatre, Vanaver and

Drapkin, with Tracy Schwarz of the '
New Lost City Ramblers as special
guest, celebrated 21 “Coming

 

caves,” Bill told me later. “They
arose from a practical purpose.” He
explained that music was often a
means of communication, or used as
a vocal outlet Under difficult
working conditions as in the case of
slaves in the South. Livia added
that their dances, too, began as an
efficient way of performing certain
tasks, that this is evident in the
rhythm of the movement.

“But,” warns Tracy, “it is a
common myth that all folklore was
always done by everybody.” Then
trying to hide a smile he added
_“Some people can remember the 17
verses better than others. No,
seriously, some folklore is reserved
for hard workers only._,;’.»}J,V_,

Vangelis Only Leads

To a Broken Climax

BY TOM WASELESKI

Albedo 0.39
Vangelis.
RCA Records, LPL 1-5136.

Albedo has nothing to do with
sex.

And in case you haven’t heard it
tossed around the cafeteria lately,
Vangelis deﬁnes it on the back of his
album cover as: “The reﬂecting
power of a planet or other
non-luminous body. A perfect
reﬂector would have an Albedo of
100%. The Earth’s Albedo is 39%
or 0.39.”

Clever title, eh? But is it a clever
album?

In case you hadn’t heard,
Vangelis was the horse that Jon
Anderson of Yes was backing to ﬁll
in at organ during one of that
group’s many personnel crises.

Of course, Vangelis never got the
job, but Anderson contributed
vocally to his friend’s solo album,
“Heaven and Hell,” an attempt at
instrumental depiction that ranged
from brilliantly creative to embarr-
assingly deliberate.

It’s. hard to say either of those
things about Vangelis’ second
album, “Albedo 0.39.” For one

ale thing there seems to be a, concept

  

 

here involving time and space that
becomes lost - in some rather
randomly selected titles. Another
drawback is that the music is just so
darn boring.

“Nucleogenesis Part 2” seem
scarcely related, and an anticipated .
climax to “Part 2” is derailed as the
music breaks and we are entertain-
ed by a solitary ﬁnger dialing a
phone, rather than given the full
force of the satisfying crash.

Vangelis shows himself to be an
adequate musician, as he proved
himself to be a budding conceptual-
ist on his ﬁrst album. The pieces
here lack development, however.
As in the instance of the broken
climax, he fails to capitalize
elsewhere on strong melodies,
building tension and interesting
interplays.

“Alpha” is about the only source
that is well-tapped, yet here
Vangelis doesn’t know where to
quit, so he takes an exciting mode
and repeats it to death.

The title track is nothing but a
case of space lust in which Vangelis '

(we presume) narrates all the facts
about the sun you learned in sixth
grade and were glad to forget. In
the background are cheap synthetic
whirrs and wheers, I guess to
portray space travel. Eventually

they come to drown out our vocalist .

who's gotten hung up on “...albedo
O.39...albedo0.39...albedo O.39..."

For all the probing of time and
space that’s attempted on this
album, one thing’s been overlook-
ed, and that’s the space and time
limitation of a 33 1/3 long-playing
record. After listening to this thing
about ten times, when that needle
automatically takes off at the end of
the plastic, I feel more bliss than all
of Vangelis’ albedo libido can bring
me.

’Wo rds’ :  

(Continued from Page_I2) .

Shea Stadium and the Ed Sullivan
Show brings back fond memories,
as do the photos from fan
magazines. However, this wears
thin and gets downright boring
halfway through (the production
runs just under an hour and a half).

The angle used by the promoters
of the show is to try to capture the
social importance of the Beatles,
using the multitude of slides and
ﬁlm footage, while their songs
supply all the needed audio
interpretation. The problem is that
what we’_re presented with isn’t
anything that hasn’t been revealed
about the Beatles before.

\. , . .-..~--...__ .-._\.

We already know that the Beatles
were the most important musicians
ever to walk the face of the earth.
We know that Paul is cute and
writes great ballads. John is
depicted as the ballsy rocker turned
peace advocate. Early in the show,
George comes through as shy.
Later: we see him as the gentle guru.
Ringo remains throughout the
clowning drummer unaware of what
he and his group are doing to the
world.

“Away With Words” simply
doesn’t deliver enough. It’s great if
you’re into nostalgia about the
Beatles and the 60’s. I'm not.

The strobe light, which blazed
during “Revolution,” woke me up

  Artists’ Path Travels
To Folklore’S Origins

(Continued from Paoe 12)

it’s not as easy as it looks. “It took
months to learn that dance,” Livia
said, “because I kept spraining my
toes and I had to wait for them to
heal before I could begin again.”

Bill taught the audience a hand
game, “Juba,” created during
slave days and played by black
people living on the Georgia Sea
Islands. His instructions were easy
to follow and soon we were all
clap-slapping time to Ju-ba-this-
and-Ju-ba-that-and-Ju-ba-killed-
the-yel-low-cat and we, were quite
pleased with ourselves. .

Then’ Bill took the simple
knee-and-palm slapping action he’d
taught us, added extra beats, slaps
to his chest and increased the tempo
with dozens of variations until his
hands were blurred and the
audience's eyes were glued to his
intense concentration,—-he couldn’t

possibly continue—he’d burst! He I

stopped, sweating. Everyone
sighed, mouths open in amaze-
ment. Yes, some things are saved
for the hard workers. .

“Juba” isn’t the only thing Bill
does well. As the audience enters
the auditorium they are struck by
the number of instruments which
clutter one side of the stage. Along
with the usual guitar, banjo and
tambourine, there are instruments
unique to other lands. Bill is
accomplished on the tamboura,
laouto, lyra and tappan.

Once in Crete the couple met a
laouto player and cafe owner who
also writes songs. He told them no
foreigner could ever play his songs,
not understand them, until he met
Bill and Livia. Perhaps he felt what
their audience feels—as Livia put
it-——“Whatever you’re doing, en-
joy!”

Panthers Vetoed by Nixon, 66-63

BY JOHN FEYDO

Norm Nixon of Duquesne brought
his classy act to 5,308 fans at the
Field House Saturday night and
although he struggled throughout
the first half, hitting on just one of
eight’ shots for two points, he
showed why he is the number-one
player in the city and a deﬁnite All
American candidate.

With the Panthers maintaining a

40-37 lead after six and a half 1

minutes of the second half and
Nixon still sputtering along with
only a single basket, he suddenly
caught ﬁre and put on a magic show
that sent the Duquesne partisans
back to the Bluff in a state of
delerium, while Panther supporters
simply walked away shaking their
heads in amazement after the
Dukes captured a thrilling 66-63
overtime win.

Nixon connected on his next eight
shots, mostly from the top of the
key, and also canned ﬁve consecu-
tive free throws to completely
dominate the ﬁnal stages of the
contest.

But it was in the overtime stanza
that Nixon really strutted his stuff,

hitting a foul line jumper, a

breakaway layup, two foul shots and
another breakaway layup in less
than two minutes as the stunned
Panthers quickly found themselves
trailing by eight in the extra
period, 65-57. _,

“l’ve been telling people for four
years now that Norm ‘Nixon is a
great ballplayer.” exclaimed Du-
quesne coach John Cinacola in the
happy Dukes’ locker room. ‘ ‘I think
he proved it tonight. Norm has to be
one of the top ﬁve guards in the
country.”

Nixon’s showing completely

overshadowed a stellar game by
Pitt’s Larry Harris. who ﬁnished
with 35 points, including one stretch
where he hit 11 of 12 from the ﬂoor.
Harris hit eight of his last nine
ﬁrst-half shots, leading all scorers
at intermission with 18 points. He
also pulled down eight rebounds.
Strangely, though, Harris went
almost 14 minutes in the second half
without a hoop, although he hit ﬁve

foul shots during this period.
Harris, Mike Rice (11) and Sonny
Lewis (10) scored all but seven of
the Panther points. In the ﬁrst half,
Harris and Rice accounted for 24 of

the 26 Pitt markers, as Lewis’ single

hoop was the only other mark in the
Panther scorebook. .
Both teams employed zone
defenses most of the way,
attempting to force each other to
take perimeter shots. Lonnie

McClain and Jeff Baldwin kept the

Dukes in the game, combining to hit
seven straight jumpers to account
for all the Duquesne scoring during

the ﬁnal 10 minutes of the ﬁrst half .

after the Panthers jumped off to a
6-0 lead.

In beating Pitt for the fourth
consecutive time, the Dukes
connected on 29 of 66 tries from the
ﬁeld for 44 percent, while the

Today's Wrestling:
Sequins and Show

BY JIM LEWIS

VWhat has two arms, two legs, a ton of glittering sequins and the acting

talent of a carrot?

A professional wrestler, that’s what.

‘If you've ever caught

“Championship Wrestling,”

WSTV

(Steubenville) Channel 9’s'version of “Sesame Street” with violence,
then you probably knew the answer to the above question.

_ “Championship's” wrestling is certainly an education—an education
in how a competitive sport has died in popularity and appeal in the last

ten years. Wrestlers in gimmicky attire rave to over-excitable

announcers of how they will demolish their next opponent. Managers .

run rampant in the ring, threatening ofﬁcials and chasing after
loud-mouthed partisans. Head referees discuss crucial topics at length
with a wrestler, while the grappler's partner is being double-teamed by
two tag-team bullies.

Ability to wrestle professionally has been replaced by ability to put on
the best show. As long as you're evil-looking and have the reputation for
being a meanie and a no-good guy, you can challenge the champion for
the wrestling federation’s coveted number-one belt.

L?-St Saturday. my father and I watched “Championship Wrestling, ”
hoping to see the same athletic display Bill Cardille’s WIIC-TV show
gave us years ago.‘ We were disappointed.

Bouts w’ere'nothing more than publicity stunts to enhance certain
performer s dirty images. Fake falls and punches abound; 300-pound
giants turned helpless 200-pound wrestlers into pretzels, while the
crowd (mostly children) screamed in ecstasy when one manager threw
salt into an opposing wrestler's face, thus giving the hero the win by
default.

What ever happened to Chilly Billyand Bruno Sammartino? The days
when only a handful of wrestling villains were around to pit strength and

stamina against the guy in the white trunks are gone, the days when the '

late Pie Traynor’s infamous question (Who can?) was on every
Pittsburgher’s tongue.

With the ridiculously circus-type air wrestling has taken, no wonder
“Championship Wrestling" has transgressed in popularity in the past
ten years. If people wanted to watch “Sesame Street," they could turn
the channel.

percent night on 26 of 74 tries. Both
clubs stepped to the foul line 14
times in the well-ofﬁciated contest
—-the Panthers canning 11 shots
and the Dukes eight. On the
boards, Duquesne held a slight
edge, 48-44. Don Gambridge with
11 and Rich Cotten with 10 led the
Dukes. For Pitt, Harris and Ed
Scheuermann gathered eight car-
oms apiece, while point guard Pete
Strickland pulled down six stray
shots and dished out nine assists.
Although he didn’t score a single
point, Strickland’s strong ﬂoor
game kept the Panthers rolling
throughout the contest.

On the negative side, _Scheuer-
mann missed all 11 of his ﬁeld goal
tries, ‘many off-balance, as he
seemed intimidated by the stronger
Dukes inside.

“Eddie had a tough night,” Pitt
coach Tim Grgurich admitted.
“The ball just wouldn’t drop for
him. _

“But Nixon’s just a fantastic
ballplayer. I think he showed that
tonight.”

Pitt enjoyed the biggest lead of
the game at 40-33 with 14:32
remaining when Lewis hit a 18-foot
jumper immediately before Nixon
began his one-man onslaught, his
third straight jumper knotting
things at 41-41. After Nixon
connected three more times to send

Duquesne ahead by ﬁve, 48-43,.

Lewis brought the sellout crowd to
its feet with the slam-dunk of the
year, a spectacular David Thomp-
son-type stuff that brought down
the house.

The Dukes then maintained a
lead of three to ﬁve points until
Harris hit his first shot in a long
personal scoreless stretch to pull
Pitt within one, 56-55.

Scott Nedrow hit a 15 foot
fall-away jumper from the right side
with 36 seconds showing on the
clock as the Panthers regained the
lead 57-56, before he fouled

McClain with :15 to go.

McClain missed his ﬁrst shot, but
hit the second over the roar of the
crowd to knot the count at 57-57.

Pitt had the ball with 15 seconds

Wrestlers Shot Down,

BY MARK MURPHY

The best laid plans of mice, men
and wrestling coaches often go
awry. Just ask Pitt head man Dave
Adams. His plans for victory were
torpedoed by a balanced Navy team
as the Panthers sank to their ﬁfth
straight defeat, 29-15, Saturday
afternoon at the Field House.

“I thought we could split the
matches 5-5,” Adams said after the
loss. I “We would take the
118-pound match and the last four.
We ﬁgured we would beat them at
167 pounds and 190 pounds and
when we didn’t, it hurt us.”

What really hurt Pitt was a string
of six straight losses stretching from
the 134-pound match to the 167
bout. In that time" Navy turned a 6-0
deﬁcit into a 27-6 advantage and it
was all" over..for th\e,Panthejrs.

Last summer, when the Pan-

Nedrow Fights   off injuries

BY MARIA SCIULLO

Scott Nedrow is the kind of person
who would probably enjoy being a
contestant on “The $20,000 Pyra-
mid.” The 6-2 junior guard from’
Donora loves working under
pressure, both on and off the
basketball court. .

This season, there certainly have
been many pressures placed upon
Nedrow and his Panther team-
mates. Added to the frustration of a
4-15 record ‘for Scott were the
physicaland psychological pains of
a hand operation and a recurring
shoulder separation.

“When I came back to Pitt last
fall and found out they had to
operate, (on the hand) I was really
bummed out,” he said. “About a
week and a half before practice
started, Iwas allowed to play and by
then Iwas out of shape and unsure
of where I was going to ﬁt in on the‘
team.” .

After a sluggish ﬁrst three
games, Nedrow turned in his finest
performance against Southern Illi-
nois in the Pittsburgh Classic at the
Civic Arena. ; ‘

“Scotty came in against SIU and
did an excellent take-charge job.
His fplay got us back into the game," ’
commented coach Tim Grgurich;

Although he hasn’t been shooting
as well as he’d.liketo, Nedrow has
been getting used to, switching‘ frorri

' second to occasional point guard.

“We’re disappointed" but there I‘

were some good points,” Adams

' said. “We are a young team and

our ﬁrst two guys are starting to
come on.

“We have Penn State next,”,
Adams continued. “They are

super. ~-'I-’hey:=have~-lost only to-

“The point guard position realy
makes you ‘think a lot, because
you’re in a situation where people
depend on youto run things,” Scott
claimed: '

One thing this particular hooper

» doesn’t have to be reminded of is to

Michigan, who is the last team we

play.”

The Nittany Lions, ninth-ranked _

and sure to move up after a victory
over number-four Lehigh, would be
a great team for the Panthers to
break their losing skein against.

And as for Dave Adams, it’s back to

the drawing board.

“be aggressive.” Nedrow plays

with such intensity that sometimes

he gets overly competitive.
“Actually,” he admitted, “I

_ never thought I was over-aggres-

sive. Sometimes, though, I do‘ get
keyed-up and it can hurt more than
help, because then foul. If
I’ p to make a mistake in a
game, it makes me try all the
harder, but then I might try too
hard.”

Keeps up with Jones

She started playing basketball
eight years, ago. Frustrated
because she had trouble connecting
in grade school basketball‘ games-
“That really put my conﬁdence in
the sand”——Randolph bought her
own basketball, walked a couple

blocks to the playground, and
played against the boys.

Although“ “I played street ball
many a time," Randolph didn’t join
her ﬁrst organized team until four
years ago.

 minder,

  

The Cats’ big win over Cincinnati
(Feb. 2) helped ease the disappoint-
ment brought about by the team’s
frequent losses, but recently, Scott
has had to cope with more than just
emotional anguish. Last month, he
separated his right shoulder during
practice and had to miss the Notre
Dame and Syracuse games.
Originally, he had suffered this
injury in a high school freshman
game. Although Scott has been
playing again since the Penn State
contest, the psychological aspects
are disturbing.

“I’m right-handed, so it’s my
shooting arm that’s affected,”

 

 

- Scott Nedrow [32], shown here putting in a layup against Virginia, has

explained Nedrow. “Any injury can ‘

make you hesitant when you’re

basketball at the University. This .
year, he served as chairman "of the
campus United Way fund and, f
besides belonging to two honorary;
fraternities, is the vice-president of
Sigma Chi. .

As the season rolls on, Nedrow
will just have to live with the
annoyances of occasional shoulder
ﬂair-ups, and as he puts it, ‘‘I can’t
stop playing, but I’m doing my best
with what I have.”

6-2.

Sherwin and Hetz, Pitt’s leading
goal-getters, broke loose on a
two-on-one with Hetz setting up a
streaking Sherwin for his 17th goal
and the second period ended with
Princeton on top, 6-3.

By now, _the Panthers had a
decisive edge in the momentum,
but a penalty early in the third
period cost them a power play goal,
a slap ‘shot from the blueline. which
sailed by Bradley. Pitt, which
followed with a pair of power play
goals of its own, hung tough and cut
the lead to 7-5 within a minute,
starting with defenseman Larry
Gallik’s blast from the ‘point with
8:42 remaining in the game. The
tally came with only seven seconds
elapsed in the Princeton penalty.

Then Dave Elson, who appears to
have the hardest wrist shot on the
. Pitt squad, also whistled a shot from
the point, the puck deflecting off a
Princeton defender and into the net.
But bad luck took over from‘ there.
First Bill Gedeon and Duffy missed
on a two-on-one break, then the
Panthers missed two goals by a
matter of inches. With Bradley
pulled in the ﬁnal minute, the
Tigers iced away the 8-5 victory.

Like last week, the Panthers
dropped their opener in unfriendly
territory and were forced to pull all
stops to prevent catastrophe and a
hasty retreat home.

change the defensemen were there
to help.

Though the Middies showed
early life and led 2-1 at one point in
the opening frame, Pitt had little
trouble with one of the lesser
aggressive of Navy hockey teams.
Sherwin led the Pitt attack with a
hat trick and Hetz added a pair of
tallies to up their goal totals to 20
and 22, respectively.

Elson made good a pass from
Hetz a two-on-one play with 15:39

‘left in the opening 20 minutes for
the Panthers’ ﬁrst goal, then the
two reversed roles with a minute
remaining for a power play goal
which knotted the score at two
apiece.

Pitt took complete control as the ,

second period began, scoring six
unanswered goals in building an 8-2
lead. With 13:46 remaining in the

middle frame, Gallick shanked a’

slap shot from the blue line, Hetz

caught a piece of it with a swipe and ‘

Duffy banged it home for his eighth
goal of the year.

A breakaway by «Hetz, Sherwin’_s
shot from the slot and a breakaway
by Gary Fries all found success and
the Panthers, who dominated by
simply forechecking, led _6-2 going
into the stretch run. Sherwin scored
a power play goal a minute into the
ﬁnal frame, then Duffy rammed
home a pass from’ behind the net
minutes later to put the game out of
reach.

Navy's leading scorer, Bill

only two chances of beating the
national champion and number-one
ranked Eagles were slim and none.
Predictably, Pitt received a 145.85-
126.60 trouncing. .
4 Despite the margin of victory.
Pantherette coach Donna peMarino
saw a few bright spots shining
through for her 2-3 team.

‘ ‘Regina Carson turned in the job
of the evening,” DeMarino said.
“She received her ﬁrst 9.0 ever in
college (on the balance beam) and
had a good score in the all-around
(34.60).”

Unfortunately for Carson and
Pitt, her score was good for only
ﬁfth place in the all-around. Clarion
’managed to take the first four slots,
turning in scores of more than 9.0 in
over half the routines.

The Eagles have the good fortune
of having last year’s national
all-around champion, Connie Israel,
and the highest scoring member of
last year’s Olympic team, Carrie
Englert, on their roster. Because of .

. the reputation of these two women,

the school can recruit nationally and

   Women Gymnasts Fall, Men Beat Rock

have team members from as far
away as Minnesota.

“With a team in our stage, we
know on a perfect night what our
capabilities are,” DeMarino said.
“On a perfect night our capabilities
are not as high as Clarion’s. We
tried to raise our score to get a
better seeding at the regionals.

“We had our highest halftime
score ever (65.10) but our beam
event score was low and that is what
cost us a shot at our all-time score,”
the third-year coach continued. “If
we can keep our ﬁrst half score that
high we should do real well the rest
of the season.”

Other highlights for Pitt were the
performances of Alison Hoburg and
Cyndee Severyn. The former
turned in an all-around score‘ of
32.65 which featured an 8.5 in
vaulting, while the latter also placed
high in the vault and helped Pitt to a
record score in the event, 33.95.

The team has two more dual
meets remaining before competing
in the Pennsylvania Championships
and the Eastern "Regionals in
March.

In men’s gymnastics, the Pan-
thers traveled to Slippery Rock last
week and came away with
179.90-164.25 victory.

Taylor Gamers Gold
As Runners Visit MSU

BY DAVE MCDONALD

EAST LANSING, (Mich.)——The
Panther tracksters put their show on
the road this past Saturday at the
54th annual Michigan State (MSU)
Relays. Only Keith Taylor enjoyed
the thrill of victory, but many Pitt
track men collected medals along
with personal bests.

The total medal count for the
Panthers was 10, while the personal
best tally was three, with only one
member picking up a shiny for
placing in the top five.

To quote Pitt coach Mike
Agostinella, the team came alive
this weekend.

“The team deﬁnitely showed
improvement, but at times lacked
good strategic and tactual run-
ning,” he said. “The MSU Relays
were the dress rehearsal we needed
to get ready for the Central
Collegiate Conference meet next
weekend at Michigan.”

well-fought 2-mile run“ with a
personal record of 9:01.5, an

The unanimous surprise for best
performance of the meet for the
Panthers went to sophomore Ron
Wirick. Wirick placed third in the
incredible 20 seconds lower than his
previous best.

Wirick is sometimes described as
a lazy distance runner, but has
continued to improve over the
course of the season. So far this
year he has run his two personal
bests in both the mile and the
two-mile. What's gotten into
Wirick? '

“I have been trying to get more
rest this year, even if it does mean
cutting down on my mileage,”
Wirick explained. “The coach
‘doesn’t like me skipping morning
runs but I think it helps to sleep in
sometimes.” The 9:01 really
boosted my conﬁdence but now I
have to get psyched for the Centrals
this weekend.”

“It was a long-awaited win over
an arch-rival,” coach Frank
D’Amico said. “They have been
beating us for a long time when they
shouldn't have.”

The win gave the team their first
winning season in quite a while and
left thoughts of further victorious
seasons dancing in D’Amico’s
head.

“Next year will be better,” the
rookie coach stated. “Even though
we had only ﬁve meets, we hope to
schedule about 12 next year. The
meets we pick up should be wins for
us.”

As he has done all year, Rob
Pasterick led the Panthers, picking
up wins in the ﬂoor exercises (a
season high 8.9), parallel bars and
all-around. Other Pitt winners were
Mitch Sperro in the side horse and
Frank Klein in the high bar, both
pleasant surprises for D’Amico.

The Panthers do not compete
again until March 18 when they
travel to Illinois State University for
the Eastern Championships. But

 

Granted, Panther gymnast Rob Pasterick performs well on the still

don't let the long layoff fool you.
The Panthers will be working
harder than ever.

“We have to learn compulsory
moves to take the full team,”
D’Amico explained. “I would like
to take the whole team and place in

the top six but I don't know how
things will go yet.”

No matter how the Panthers do in ‘

the Easterns, this year has been the
team's most successful ever. And,
as D’Amico pointed out, next year
could be even better.

To Future Panthers Foes

“I really didn’t know the
fundamentals until I started playing
AAU ball,” she admits now, but she
picked them up fast. By the time
she was a senior, Randolph had
college bids from prestigious teams
like UCLA and Rutgers. Other
offers ranged from across the
country (Nevada-Las Vegas and

Tankers Dunk Clarion

BY JOHN FINN

Clarion State's women’s swim-
ming team learned an important
lesson Friday night, courtesy of
Kate Mathison’s Pantherette tank-
ers.

Realizing that they might not win
the meet solely on their perfor-
mance in the water,. the Eagles
resorted to some covert trickery to
upset Pitt's balance.

Instead of swimming a short
course meet as was originally
scheduled, ofﬁcials at Clarion
suddenly changed the meet to long
course competition in an apparent
attempt to fluster Pitt.

“What they did was perfectly
legal,” said Mathison, “but it really
backﬁred. When our girls heard
this they were more psyched-up and
swam a very good meet.”

A “very good meet” is right—the

time of 1:56.72 and Sandy Moran

giving Clarion a ﬁrst place and one

The Eagles lengthened their lead

third in the 50-yard backstroke.
Kluglein scored the only points for
Pitt in that event with a second place

Texas as well as New York colleges
and Canada (Nova Scotia).

Randolph opted for Pitt because
of the quality of competition—“I
was intrigued by the schedule”—
featuring the big two of women’s
basketball—Immaculata and Delta
State. -

With her experience from playing
AAU basketball, Randolph has a
good idea about what to expect from
some of the top teams,

“A lot of girls I’m aware of. I
know how they play,” Randolph
said. Particularly Federal City
center Sheila “Too Tall ’/’ Patterson,
whom Pitt coach Pat Wallace ‘cites
as the acid test for Randolph. A

“I’ve played against her three
times,” she said. “The first time I
got bumt—that was before I played
AAU. But the second time, she
wasn’t a threat.” I A ‘

Wallace has not found Randolph

to be as much the ideal center as
she’d earlier expected. “Statistic-
ally, Wanda is doing a good job.
She is. not developing as I thought
she would.’’
Randolph says, is positioning under
the boards. And the Pantherette
style of defense is different from the
old, ﬂashy playground style.

But Randolph feels she is
adjusting well to everything except,
maybe, the early morning practices.

“Getting up at eight, you know,
just to play basketball. Plus, I had
to adjust to the university‘ in
itself—-I was still used to high school
where I knew everyone and
everyone knew me,” she said.

The strong part of Her game,
despite her fantastic scoring
(Randolph slammed in 39 points in a
game during the Pitt Invitational) is
her ability to block shots.

“I get enjoyment out of blocking
shots,” she added, then cited the
old cliche that Wallace often spouts,
“If you can play defense, the
offense will come.”

“I’ve kind of lost" my eagerness
for rebounding in a way (Since AAU
days) because of the ofﬁciating. I'm
too conscious of the ofﬁcials,”
continued Randolph, who, at one
time, seriously considered serving
as an NBA ofﬁcial.

Right now, Randolph is majoring .

in speech rhetoric and communica-
tions and says it upsets her a bit
when people stereotype her as a
physical education major, although

she’d love td coach a team (a sort of ~

when she would take over whenever
her coach was ejected for tech-
nicals). -

What Randolph is looking
forward to this season is taking on
the kingpin of women’s basketball.

“lmmaculata! My mother’s
going tocome to that game. I’m
putting everything I have into it.
I’m going to be so tired when it’s
over, I probably won’t be able to

Library, Cathedral of Learning,
Tower A, Tower C, Salk Hall, Trees
Hall, Benedum Hall, Graduate
School of Public Health, Lothrop
Residence, Student Union and on
University Drive and Aliquippa
Street.

Burglaries, robberies and more
violent forms of thievery were
reported in the Ruskin Apartments,

Tower A and on Aliquippa Street ~

and Fifth and Oakland avenues.

False ﬁre alarms were numerous,
causing the Student Union, Cathe-
dral of Learnin g, Learning Reserach
and Development Center, Scaife
Hall, McCormick Hall and Amos
Hall to be evacuated.

Fires occurred on Darraugh
Street and in Scaife and Amos
Halls.

Incidents of criminal trespassing,
water damage, auto accidents,
ﬁghts, harassment by communica-
tion, disorderly conduct and public
intoxication were reported to the
campus police in the same time
period, but none were considered
major crimes. ’ s

It all adds
up!
