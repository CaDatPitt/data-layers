F iguratively &, Literally

Midday Guest D

By BILL NIEDERBERGER

His prepared speech was good,

enough, but David Shaber’s an-
swers to the questions that fol-
lowed his lecture on “The Broad-
way Production: Theory and
Practice” offered even more of
substance to an intimate (30 peo-
ple) coffee hour-Midday Series

audience Wednesday ‘in the SU ‘

lower lounge.

Eschewing the standard rostrum
delivery, Shaber stepped down to
his audience’s level both ﬁgura-
tively and literally. With a micro-
phone in hand, the Broadway pro-
ducer attempted in his prepared
speech to paint a picture of the
realities concerned in the produc-
tion of “art” in American the-
ater.

A producer has to ﬁnd the play,
take a chance on it since no one
can accurately predict its suc-
cess, and then ﬁnd a theater for
the play. “At the beginning of the
theater season there will be about
six theaters that aren’t busy.

To get a theater you need
either a star, a top producer or
director, or a famous writer. If
Elia Kazan were to stage the
Pittsburgh telephone directory,
he’d get a theater,” said Shaber.

Professorship

iTo Stress Teacher Training a it

The Maurice and Laura Falk
Foundations established an en.-
dowed chair at the University,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld has an-
nounced. The chair, the Maurice
Falk Professorship of Politics,

will emphasize the training of
future college and university
teachers in American politics. ‘

Established in the Department
of Political Science, the profes-
sorship was called a “magnificent
contribution to the higher educa-
tion of thousands of young men
and women.”

The occupant of the chair, as
yet unnamed, will prepare doc-
toral, candidates to teach— politics
at the undergraduate college level,
Also, the chairholder will conduct
research in American politics and
contribute to the University’s on-
going undergraduate program in
practical political education.

Mostly Teachers

The Chancellor pointed out that
the majority of University grad-
uate students in political science
plan teaching careers. In some in-
stances these teachers will be em-
ployed by schools lacking political
science programs, he explained.

“This endowed chair recog-
nizes the critical need for ex-,
panding the education of young
people in politics,” the Chan-
cellor commented.

The existing undergraduate pro-
gram in political education at the
University was launched in 1953
with the support of the Maurice
and Laura Falk Foundation. In
1961, the Foundation made pos-
sible the establishment of a Center
for Politics at the University. The

new professorship will add a grad-
uate dimension to- this program.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld also ex-

plained that the chairholder’s re-

search would add to our store of F i '

knowledge about politics.

Education in politics has been a
central concern of the Foundation
for more than a decade. Since 1952,
the Foundation has made grants
to 23 colleges and universities to
support undergraduate programs
in political education. ' 

Practical Experience ‘
The Foundation has placed em-

phasis on supervised practical ex-

perience in party operations, elec-
tions, and campaigns to augment
classroom teaching. Students work
with the party or political group
of their choice. . _
T h e Foundation emphasized
the basic purpose to be achieved
as “to give students a thorough-

realistic, and unbiased under-

standing of how our political’

system works, and to motivate
him for constructive participa-
tion, or a vocational basis, in
the aﬂairs of the party of his
choice in his community of resi-
dence after graduation in ful-w
ﬁllment of responsibilities and 1

opportunities of citizenship in a '

free society.”

The Professorship of Politics is
the first endowed chair in the De-

partment of Political Science. The

department ‘was established in
1912 and has been training grad-
uate students since
1920’s. More than 1000 undergrad-
uates at the University are en-

rolled each year in political Sci-"V 

ence courses. ‘

Bradford Campus Resplendent

With Patriotic Blue And Gold

’ Dr. Swarts ‘Sold’

I I .On Language Lab

By NANCY FUCHS

There is little evidence of
the University’s colors, blue
and gold, in the decor of main
campus buildings; however
Bradford is almost patriotic in
its color scheme.

The walls of the main building
and the lockers lining the walls
are yellow, and Dr. Swarts’ con-
ference room is done in blue and
gold——g01d carpetand blue leather

chairs.
explains Dr. Swarts.

Dr. Swarts is proud of the lab-

‘oratories in the building, espe-
cially the language lab. “Johns—

I ‘A town did not have a language lab,

and this made me realize the need
,-for one here. I’m sold on it. The
secret of success is the individual
'stu_dent’s amount of listening
time.” With this philosophy in
mind, French, Spanish, and Ger-
man I and II students are re-
quired to spend two out of ﬁve
class periods in the lab, one more
than is required here. The lab
.seats'-24 people.

A chemistry and biology lab,

teach accommodating 24 students,

are currently in use. On a tour
through the chemistry lab, Dr.
Swarts pointed out salient fea-
tures. “There is one balance for
every two students and a fume
hood, which I found to be essen-
tial.” '
The biology lab will also be
, used for a psychology lab next
'_trimester; both psychology and
physics will be added to the
' curriculum then. Until then,
A the physics lab is being used
was a classroom for mathematics,
I inter-disciplinary natural sci-
ence," and biophysics.

The present library contains
‘55,000 volumes. Speaking from
experience, Dr. Swarts comment-
ed, “We learned we could not or-
der a library overnight.” Local
citizens have contributed gener-
ously to the library’s collection,
especialy in the area of fine arts.
He hopes to add 5,000 to 7,000
books a year.

‘ The book storr, the size of a
.'large closet, is primarily a place
_to buy textbooks, but according
to some students, it has a good
collection of paperbacks.

cesity ‘in ‘a small school” where
space"is at a premium.‘ One
room can seat a. lecture group

of 200, a class of 150, or a .din- '

ing group of 200.

Since Dr. Swarts taught English
at the University, as may be ex-
pected, the English department
at,Bradford is strong. The course
demands of English I and 11,
freshmen courses, are greater at
Bradford than here. First trimes-
ter freshmen wrote 18 papers and
read ﬁve books including 03‘ Hu-
man Bondage, Return of the Na-
tive, and The Great Gatsby. This
term students will read eight
books.

Some students take English 81,
Great Dramatic Literature, con-
currently with English II. The
reading is even more intensive
than in the same course here.
Students will rad 50 to 60 plays,
ranging from Greek and Roman
drama to the 20th century The-
ater of the Absurd to establish a
broad base in drama. The speed
'is usually a play per class.

Future plans for the school
include bringing dormitory stu-
dents under one roof. Presently
the men are housed in four pri-

There are tickets available for"

The women’s apartment bears
no resemblance to a typical col-

Amos Hall, each room has wal‘-

endar in the bathroom and orange
in the kitchen.

The. rooms are spacious, the
living room, bigger than‘ Holland
Hall’s date lounge, has ‘a tapestry
wall covering and a white ﬁre-
place.

Dr. Swarts hopes there will

be a central dormitory system
by next fall. “The Chancellor

himself has said he wants it '

that way,” Dr. Swarts explain-

ed. “I think there’s a building
we can get without having it
built.”

Within two years Dr. Swarts
expects the enrollment to reach
the 500 mark. With the leadership
of its president, support of the
community, dedication of the fac-
ulty, and enthusiasm and perse-
verence of the students, Bradford
cannot help but have a bright
future as an educational insti-
tution.

Lineup Switch
Helps Wrestlers

Rex Peery has made a lineup change which could

well bring victory to the Panther wrestlers when they
meet Lehigh tomorrow at Fitzgerald Field House. The

question is will Lehigh coach Gerry Leeman also counter '

with a lineup switch that could beneﬁt his team. Lee-
man says his lineup will remain as it has been, for the
Pitt match, but that remains to be seen. ' ,

Peery has dropped 177-pounder Lee Hall down to
167—pounds and moved ,191—pounder Ken Barr to 177-
pounds. The move could well be the difference between
victory and defeat for the Panthers.

’ Under his old lineup Peery
had Clair Filey, Hall, Barr and
Bill Beck from 167—pound_ _to
heavyweight, respectively. That
would mean almost such losses
for the Panthers at 167 pounds and
heavyweight, a sure win at 177-
pounds and a tossup match at 191-
pounds. ‘

The new lineup ——- Hall, Barr,
Beck and Bill Bodle —— still leaves
_ the Panthers ‘with two almost sure
losses, Beck and Bodle, but elim-
, MIKE JOHNSON inates the tossup" match at 191-
pounds. The drop in weight by Hall and Barr make them
heavy favorites to win. ,

The Panthers need three more wins and should get
two of them from Mike Johnson, at 130-pounds, and
Frank O’Korn, at 147-pounds. One more win is needed
and it will have to come from either Duff Killian at
123—pounds, Dino Boni, at 147—pounds, or Tom Baily, at
157 pounds." ’. ‘ _ «

Leeman could frustrate the Panthers strategy by
switching his lineup around, but says he won’t. Leeman
says he will not move unbeaten 130-pounder Bill Stuart up
to 137-pounds to avoid meeting Johnson.

This doesn’t make. good wrestling sense. Even if
Stuart..should beat Johnson", and he could, Lehigh has
very little chance of winning at 137-pounds where Larry
White meets O’Korn. ' -

Lehigh will be favored to lose both of these matches.
If Stuart moves up to 137-pounds he would be favored
over O’Korn and thus enhance Lehigh’s chances of winn-
ing. '

Leeman says, “I want Stuart to face Johnson because
I think he can beat him-.” Whether ' _ 
this is talk or fact won’t be dis-
covered until tomorrow night.

Here’s the way we size up the
individual matches.

123-pounds — Tom Heniff vs
Rich Warnke. The hardest match
to pick. Warnke is a shaky favor-
ite on the basis of a better record.

130-pounds — Mike Johnson
vs. Bill Stuart. There is only one
thing which stands between Stuart
and an Eastern title and that’s --------- .. -. -- 
Johnson. Johnson will win, but ‘ KEN BARR
not before wrestling his toughest match of the season.

137-pounds ——- Frank O’Korn vs. Lary White. O’Kor
is too much for White, but not for Stuart. ‘
147-pounds -' Dino Bonii vs. Doug Koch. The nod goes
to senior Koch strictly on the basis of his experience. This
could be the best match of the night. .
157-pounds  Tom Baily vs. Harley Ferguson.
Neither. has lived .up to his potential shown as a fresh-
man. But Baily has improved off of his sophomore show-
ing, while Ferguson has been a major disappointment to
Leeman this season.

1617-pounds — Lee Hall vs. Bill Lachenmayr or Jim
Smith. Hall’s drop in weight could hurt him, but not
enough to stop him from beating either of these two
medicore foes. ‘

177-pounds — Ken Barr vs. Ron Bushner. The same
thing that goes for Hall goes for Barr. Bushner’s not in
Barr’s class. i '

191-pounds — Bill Beck vs. John Gladdish. Beck
will be better wrestling at 191-pounds, but not good
enough to take Gladdish.

Heavyweight — Bill Bodle vs. John Illengwarth. If
heart and desire were all that mattered, than Bodle and
Beck will be sure winners. But ability is what counts
most and that’s what Illengwarth has. Bodle will be
fortunate to escape a pin. ,

It will be a closematch, but the Panthers should
win. That is, unless Leeman moves Stuart up. Then it

Tomorrow

By ART FLEISCHNER ,
Having played 100 per
cent- basketball at home this
season, the Panther basketball
team will try to end the year

‘with at .500 mark on the road.

The ﬁrst attempt will be tomor-
row night when they travel -to
New Wilmington, Pa., to play
Westminster.

Wednesday night’s 78-67 win.

_ over Temple gave them a 12-0_

record at the Field House. Pres-
ently they are 3-6 for road games.
After tomorrow’s game, they play
Carnegie Tech and Penn State.
The game against Westmin- »
ster could prove to be the most
difficult. In past year’s, Pitt has
always had trouble on the Ti-
tans court. Earlier this year the
Panthers defeated Westminster,
71-60. .
Coach Buzz Ridl’s team won all
their games except one since their
loss to the Panthers. They still
have four players" averaging in
double ﬁgures, led by Bob Oro—
vetz with better than a 20 point
average.
« After the win over the Titans
coach Timmons said, “We were
lucky to get that one tonight.
Westminster played a ﬁne game.
I expect it to be much harder
when we go down there.”
Temple was the ﬁfth time this
year the Panthers defeated a team
which started in a zone defense.
Last season they won 12 of 13
against a zone. Despite this Tim-
mons said, “We prefer to play
against a man to man. We have
a fast team, and when we play
against a man to man, we dram
more fouls.”
Against Temple, Dave Sauer
hit on ﬁve of his first seven
shots, and the rest of the team
took the hint. It was the Pan-
thers best shooting exhibition
in the Field House all year.
All ﬁve starters scored in double
ﬁgures led by Sauer’s 22 points.
“This was our best game at
home except for West Virginia,”
said Timmons. “Everyone was
real loose and everything seemed
to go right.” ’
Temple coach Harry Litwack
said, “Pitt has speed, height, de-
fense, shooters and hustle. On a
good night, and tonight looked
like one, they could beat any-
body.”_

Mermen Close
Season at 0hl0

Seven seniors will be swimming
in their last dual meet tomorrow
as the Panther swimmers travel
to Athens, Ohio to meet Ohio U.,
a team they beat '64-31, l_ast sea-
son.

Swirnriers apeparing in their
last meet for the Panthers are
co-captains Rob Levine and
Wayne Pappert, Ron Levine,
Steve Ganong, Wayne Hanson,
Rick" Petterson and Bill Shanahan.

They represent one of the ﬁnest
groups of swimmers ever brought
in here and were mainly respons-
ible for last scason’s 8-1 record.

That record has dipped to 3-4
this year and the swimmers will
be out to make, what was expect-
ed to be ahighly successful cam-
paign, a .500 year tomorrow.

Gymnasts Face
Penn State

A layoff from active competition
will often help an athlete regain
strength and form. The Panther
gym team has now enjoyed over
a week off, but if all that it can
do is recapture its old style, to-
morrow’s contest against Penn
State will probably be a rout.

The Lions will be coming to
Pittsburgh with one of their bet-
ter squads. Thus far they have
lost only to EIGL leader Temple
an dthey have beaten a number
of teams which hold victories
over the Panthers.

In spite of the odds against it,
_Panther coach Warren Neiger
feels that his team might have
a chance. “There is a possibility
that we could beat them,” he
said. “But I’m afraid that it’s a
very slim one.”

Although the team as a whole
has been doing poorly, Neiger
singled out some good individual
performances. ﬂ‘Ed Stim has been
doing real well,” he stated. “Even
against Navy, when he had an off
day, he managed to capture a
ﬁrst.” A

In spite of these better per-
formances by a few, the problem
of depth has remained trouble-
some for the Panthers. To make
matters even worse, it was dis-
closed Tuesday that sophomore
Bob Davies will ‘be losf tor the
year. It seems that losing players
has become a habit this season.
So has losing meets.

Meet Might Decide -

Eastern Supremacy

_ start of the season.

\

The big name in Eastern‘
collegiate wrestling will be»
at Fitzgerald Field House
tomorrow night at 8 pm.
Lehigh, the perenial power- 7
house of the mats, hopes to halt
the Panthers two game winning-. 
streak and hand the Panthers 
their third loss against ﬁve 
wins. _'

Lehigh is led by John Illeng-‘_ 
warth, who has ﬁve pins in 
eight meets. His only loss came 
on a close_ decision to NCAA 
champion Jim Nance of Syra-
cuse, 4-2. A -

Another star the Panthersi
will have‘ to contend with is
unbeaten 130-pounder Bill Stu-
art. Stuart,, 123-pounder Rich
Warnke, 137-pounder John Leek-
and 147-pounder Doug Koch
gave Leeman an outstanding ‘
group of lightweights at the

4.’

But Leek contracted mono-J if

nucleosis at the beginning of
the season and was replaced
by John Huff. Huff became
ineligiable at mid - semester
and was replaced~ by Lary
White. So Lehigh‘ is fail-]y
weak at 137-pounds. ,
Lehigh has lost three eastern
champions from last years
squad, but this hasn’t dulled
Leeman’s hopes, as he empha-
tically put it “We expect to
win!”

Panther coach Rex Peery has
the same ideas as he has jug— 
gled his line-up in order to
rack up the points early. “I
think we can win and if we 
do we’ll build up a big lead 
before the late divisions.” 7

One lineup change will occur
in the 123-pound spot where
Tom Heniff has displaced Duff

Killian, who has started every
match this season. Tomorrow
will be Heniff’s fourth bout
since he has subbed for Mike
Johnson and Clair Riley three
times. _ -

Peery has also decided to
move Lee Hall and Kenn Barr
down one weight division for
the match. Hall was down to his
new weight, 167—pounds last
week, while Barr has been
‘around three pounds over the. ‘
