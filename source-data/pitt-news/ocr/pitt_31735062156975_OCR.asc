election. Said Miss Rush:

c “It never occurred to me that
they (the members of WSGA)
should not use the letter because
it was not partisan. It seemed to
me then and it does now that the
letter was an atempt to clarify
thinking.” ‘

An attempt to issue letters was
made by the similar bodyof men’s
representatives, the Men’s Cou"ﬁ-
cil, but this was vetoed. . ‘

Ned McIntosh advisor to the
Council gave as the reason for
this: . ~

“Mr. Biddle as dean of men, and
I, as advisor, cou1d_n?t conscien-,1
tiously permit the money to be‘?
used for that purpose.”

Whether the appropriation front
the women’s ‘funds is correct or
not correct depends upon the
question of whether or not the
letter was informative or partisanf

Concerning this Miss Rush said:

“They (WSGA) are opposing, an
amendment which changes the
basic structure of. Student Con-
gress. WSGA tried to present an
informative, letter which was not‘ 
partisan or bitter. We talked to-
gether, discussing the content. The
letter was made a matter of rec-
ord on the view which the WSGA
had..taken. ' I

-“I did not challenge the use of .
WSGA funds because it seemed-
to me that the money appropriated
for student government could‘ not i
be better used.” ’ C

These statements allegedly are
backed by the content /of the let-
ter. The letter was prefaced with
the statement “~. . ‘. we are sum-
marizing for you the major points
for and against the amen.dment,fso
you may vote intelligently.”

There followed four arguments
for and five arguments against the
amendment.

The letter closed as follows:

“W. S. G. A. believes‘ that the
arguments against the amendment
far outweigh those for it. A

“Will you consider the case,
carefully, decide for yourself. and
vote . . . ”

The letter was ‘ signed by .
Corinne N clan, ' president of ‘
WSGA. C

 U Now that the exact number of male‘ and

i‘ y  female representatives to Student Congress
a has been decided, a casual observation of the

workings of that much publicized body will

, show how inconsequential the whole issue has

. een.

Why argue loud and long about any small
matter concerningour Student Congress when
actually it is not an inﬂuential organization
at. all? True, it can reﬁect student attitudes.

" It can make investigations, both“ formal and
informal. It can appoint directors to stu-
dent social aifairs. But until Student Congress
getssome power, until it gets some teeth and
muscles with which to demand, tg direct, to
administer to student needs, it is useless to
quibble over representation _results.

During the past semester"a couple of. situa-
tions arose that' will illustrate the ineffective-
ness of Congress. When student sentiment was
aroused concerning the\school’s athletic policy,
Student Congress got into gear..To date, the
only word that has come down to us is that
student and alumni appointees to the Faculty
Committee on Athletics are meeting in private,
away from the main group.

’ Henry Wallace precipitated a discussion
concerning political speakers on campus that,
as this editorial is being written, has not been
settled deﬁnitely. .

This is not a criticism of Congress or of
the ‘members of Congress. There is much that
they could do if they were able. As a legisla-
tive body representing the people for whom
the University functions they ought to have‘
the ‘authority. And only an aware, up-to-date‘
administration can provide this.

N0 Tea Dances .

Tea is seldom served at tea dances and to
 that extent they are misnamed; but they are
dances held about tea time and the persons
who attend them usually dance. Pitt not only
had no tea at its dances this semester, it had
. no dances.

._ For some unexplained reason the groups
 ‘which ‘should andusually do sponsor such af-
fairs for the students did not do so. In the
past Student Congress, Men’s Council, and
c WSGA have all taken an active interest in
seeing that that great body of independent stu-
dents had’ four or ﬁve informal afternoon
_dances during the seme_ster.iNot so this sem-
, ester’. The social life of the non—fra_ternity and
non-sorority students hit a new low.  .
V _,With the exception of two hastily organized‘
"and in some respects poorly timed events, noth-
ing at all ~was done to give these students some
afternoon social aifairs. There are reasons, of
course, why such affairs are not always suc-
cessful. Yet good publicity and sound manage-
‘rnent, we believe, could overcome most if not
all of these objections. 'And there is a need.
If the embryonic Independent organization
is looking for a cause which will gain them
student support, it could, do. worse than to
‘champion more and better afternoon socials
-_ for the whole student body.

One More Month
And Greek ‘Gals '
Toke if Easy

ac  
Issue  

The men haveit easy.

Just about twice during the entire school year,
frater‘ni/ty men bedeck themselves in their ﬁnest
smile and persuasive manner to rushelloutatth-

freshmen.

Members of the male order, you‘ are lucky.
Think of the poor female souls who spend six
months of the year rushing their heads oif. These
Greek gals spend more time beaming over cokes
than they would ever consider spending over the
books. H

And‘ the amount of coke they consume!

This coke date idea has possibilities. It is a
wonder that that well known southern bottling
company hasn't directed a stream of literature to-
ward the campus for rushing purposes. It might pay
them _to give each sorority girl a special short
course in the art of persuasion. V

But coke dates or luncheon dates, can you
imagine wearing a perpetual‘ smile for‘ more than
six months? Oh my a-ch_ing jaw! Little wonder
that the Owl has an easy time getting these Greek
women to smile for the camera.

And it isn’t only the sorority girl who suffers
from this extended rushing. The poor freshman
woman must sit and take all of that gushing from
a woman she doesn’t know, might not". be inter-
ested in, and who isn’t interested in what she is
saying. How cruel to the poor little frosh.

These unsuspecting little ladies, by the time
the ﬁrst month passes into oblivion, have learned
a stereotyped" response to: “What courses are you
taking? How do you like your profs? What do
you think of Pitt?” along with assorted informa-
tion as to ‘address, telephone number, and when
“we’l%be able to "get together again.” . ‘

But, then, girls, there’s only one more gruell-
ing month of rushing. Have courage, and endure
the hardships. There are greener pastures on ﬁle
other side. V E i‘

Vef Subsistence Increased .7

With the opening of the second session of the 80th Con-
gress, veterans may look forward to early action on the pro-
posed increase in their subsistence allotments. -

The bill to increase single ‘veterans’ allowances by $10

and married vets $15, was shelved inthe» latter part of the '

last session, but has been promised quick action this term.
This hope is all that many veterans are clinging to as they
continue struggling to make ends¢
meet on the amount now given.
A poll conducted by, Life Mag-
azine last year. showed that only
one percent of veterans going to
a midwestern university could
meet expenses with their govern-
ment checks. A locally conducted
poll showed this number to be less
than ten per cent on the Univer-
sity campus. The average over-
all monthly expenses for single
and married Veterans at West Vir-
ginia were" $96 gnd $146 respec-
tively. These ﬁgures probably
would be considerably higher if
the same poll ‘were taken now.

The effects of this -condition are
showing on many students’ grades. ,
Forced to work in much of their
spare time, he neglects. his les-
sons and leaves homework —un-A
done. Other students are forced
to leave school outright. This has
been the case repeatedly at West
Virginia as at.practica1ly' all oth-
er schools throughoutthe coun-
try. , '

Let’s hope the promises of local
Congressmen h’ave’not been idle
and that an early increase will be-
forthcoming to relieve this strain-
ed condition-——R.I.

Speech Policy
Reconsidered

(Continued from page 1)
individuals had used the Univer-
sity to gain publicity; that is one
of the reasons for prohibiting po-
litical speeches. “Wouldn’t some
discretion among speakers be nec-
essary, and wouldn’t that present
difficulties?” the committee want-
ed to know.

Many different opinions were
provoked on’ whether speakers
ought to be carefully selected. But
all students agreed on this: po-
litical speakers should be allow-
ed to speak to students on cam-
pus facilities.

The committee plans to hold at

similar meeting with faculty mem-
bers within the next three weeks.

Members of the committe are as
follows: Stanton C. Crawford.
chairman and Dean of the Col-
lege; Vincent W. Lanfear, Dean of
Business Education; Arthur E.
Newstather, Dean of the school of
Social Sciences; Theodore W. Bid-
dle, Dean of Men; and C. B. Nut-
ting, Vice Dean of the School of

Ellsworth Men to Entertain
CWEN Directoy ‘Blind Dates’

Ellsworth men roll out the pro-
verbial‘ red carpet for on—campus
women again, and deck out the
Center Tuck Shop like the Du-
quesne Club for the feminine
cloud that will descend in the near
future.

Studying the problem of enter-
taining co—eds at the Center has
gone through a long and tedious
process, and the men students

have come up with a plan that
will provide an excellent means of
social contact.

Interested men have placed one
dollar in a kitty, held by Student
Congress social committee, and
then each man’s name is placed in
a group with half-a-dozen others.

_Most of them are matched with

random-selected’ dates, or ‘com-

panions’ from the CWEN direc-

tory.

Girls will be notiﬁed by mail
of their selection, and if agreea-
ble, will be guests of the men at
luncheon in the'Center Tuck Shop.
They will also be conducted on a
tour through the Center.

Haf a dozen Ellsworth students besiege the Student Desk at the
Bayard Street extension to apply for luncheon dates with campus
coeds under the new plan devised by Ellsworth Student Council.
Strangely enough all six men pictured above are members of the
Little Student Congress, rushing to be among the ﬁrst chosen to
meet Pitt women.

erous friends, living and dead,
through their gifts and bequests to

These gifts amount to $54 mil-

bowls and glasses of delicate blues,

Center of the display is the
stained glass collection, which fea-

Wabash Arts
Scholarships

CRAWFORDSVILLE, Ind. (IP)——
Wabash College has officially in-
augurated a unique_‘program of

scholarships sponsored by busi-
ness and industrial ﬁrms.

The plan is based on the belief
that liberal arts colleges provide
better foundations for business
leaders than specialized schools,
and that private business organi-

zations should help privately
ﬁnanced educational institutions.

Under the plan each participat-

ing company contributes $1200 a

year. From this fund a freshman,

sophomore, junior and senior each

receive $200. The remaining $400
goes into the operating funds of
the college.

Y Tops League
Despite Upset

By Electrons

The Electrons shocked the
Strike League on Friday by
causing the YMCA bowlers to
drop their ﬁrst match of the sea-
son, two games to one. The Y re-
mains on top of the loop, never-
theless, going into the ﬁnal week
of play. _ I

Frank Beatty was the Winner’s
dynamo with a 447 total and a 181
in his ﬁrst game. It was the
league’s highest score on Friday.

On a different alley the A.S.M.
E.Sl toyed with the Manifolds,
taking three straight games. Mike
Zolton yelled timber and came
down with a 430 to-tal to lead the
winners.

But Shorty Vosefski, sweating
in Vain for the Manifolds, gar-
nered the high score of the match,
a 170. ,

Vets 2, in the meantime, jolted
Civil A three straight times to
sweep their match. The results
are deceiving, however, in that
the ﬁnal game was a thriller right
down to the clunk of the last fall-
ing pin. ' _

Bill Karasko racked up ﬁve suc-
cessive strikes to give the Vets
the game. His score in that game
was a 174. And his total for the
afternoon was 435. _

Civil B took their match from
Vets 1 who voiced no opposition.

Match Score Record

The 1948 riﬂe campaign enters the. second week today with
record—breaking results being scored by Pitt, riﬂemen.

Firing last week against a group of western schools, including
the University of Arizona, the Pitt marksmen ﬁred a total of 1845,
breaking the all-time Pitt record for any one match.

The overthrown record stood at 1837, ﬁred, according to
M/Sgt. James Doherty’s ﬁles, in the 1945 season.

Encouraged by last week’s re—¢

suits, the varsity and ROTC teams
have turned their guns on a pow-
erful array of, universities, in-
cluding Purdue, Cornell, Indi-
ana, Michigan State, Kentucky,
Harvard and MIT.

The ﬁring to date has been done
in postal matches—results being
computed by the separate oppo-

nents and exchanged by mail. But .

Friday, January 16, ﬁnds the Pitt
sharpshooters in a shoulder-to-
shoulder match with Carnegie
Tech marksmen, at the Tartan

there’s plenty of room for promotions.

“But that’s not the real point. Some men
belong in the air. They were born wanting

Hampered by Carlson’;

 Emphasis on ‘Continuity’

By John

Golightly

There was a time, you know, when Pitt played pretty good
basketball. But their performance this season emphasizes that good
basketball continues to. be only a memory at the Stadium.

There will be dissenters——Doc Carlson for one. Letme say then,
Car1son’s system is a good one. But it requires great players to be
luccessful and Pitt lacks this requirement.

Sammy David and Dodo Can—¢

terna are ﬁne performers. l be-
lieve David could make the var-
sity of almost any college in the
country. He is a great all-around
player. However, both David and
Canterna are hampered under the
Carlson system. .
“Possession” Slows Play

«Time after time they drive
down the middle, receive the in-
tended pass, and are immediate-
ly tied-up by two defenders. Carl-
son’s emphasis on possession and
‘up under’ shots has resulted in

Va dreary succession of jump balls.

David seldom takes a set shot
and Canterna’s two-handed ‘up

ease. This pass and cut dogma

All of us have some degree of this very

Those who are really smart may keep
hoping for luck—but they go right ahead

unexpected emergencies and provide ulti-

ning and passing rather than
pumping that apple through the
cords. Rarely do the Pitts get ‘a
push or a hook shot from near the
foul circle. Even in basketball,
variety should be the spice of life.

Fast Break Just a Name

The newly-installed fast break
has been a fizzle. Although the
two forwards break fast, the three
deep men usually plod down
court just in time to meet the op-"
ponents who come driving back
with the rebound.

Excessive dribbling sometime:
cuts the fast break to a slow waltz.

Maybe Carlson’s system is the

After

Pitt is favored to rack up another win in this contest but
*they may have to change their

“dribble in” tactics to — do so.
Knight employs a tight zone de-
fense that is difﬁcult to get
through.

Pitt May Try Scoring

Coach Carlson may have to or-
der his proteges to pop at the
basket from the ﬁeld.

The Blue an'd Go1d’s inability
to connect with setshots has been
evident in past performances.
Based on a rough computation,
the Pitts have about 20 percent
average in hitting ﬁeld shots. This
isn’t winning basketball.

The poor relations from Beth-
any are underdogs because of
their record. Bethany is one of
the poorest district quintets. They
have won but once in six starts.

Bisons Dangerous

Coach Knight has a young team
that hasn’t yet lived up to its
potentialities. Observers say that
the Bisons may yet turn out to be
spoilers. One of these nights
they’ll explode in someone’s face.

Crawford Cameron and Jim
Mewhirter will probably start at
forward for the Green and White.
Brentwood’s free scoring Perry
Bowden gets the center call. Carl
Grizzle and Bill Dumbaugh an-
swer the guard call.

This game will prove a source

of irritation to, Coach Carlson,»

possibily on the outcome but more
than likely on the method. Noth-
ing aggravates the Doctor more
than a zone where his boys can’t
lay up their shots.

Leo Bemis, Intramurals Direc-

Howdy Odell, present Yale grid V

Decni Urges Quick Return
or 4-Year Course

 

NEW YORK, N. Y. (IP)—Rejecting the general attitude of
liberal arts educators that the accelerated wartime program of study
is detrimental to both students and faculty, Dean William B. Baer
of the New York University College of Arts and Pure Science, urged
that the traditional four—year curriculum be restored.

Dean Baer asserted that “haste—ridden” students consider college
in as little time as possible. He

a “marathon" to be completed

pointed out that veteran students$‘

who are trying to complete their
college educations in the shortest
possible time are “unwittingly”
setting a bad example for the
non-veteran undergraduates.
“These young men, seeing their
older colleagues twisting time by
the forelock, think that they must
follow suit," he said. “Thus their
minds are made up to ﬁnish their
undergraduate training in three
and one—half, three, and in some
instances, two and one—half years.

“But who can say that these

i * relatively immature minds can
stand the strain‘? What will they.

really know when they ﬁnish
their marathon?" he asked.

NYU Dating
Bureau Hos
390 Cienis

NEW YORK, N. Y.——M0re than
300 applications have been regis-
tered at the date bureau estab-
lished several months ago at New
York University, in New York
City. Both sexes are evenly rep-
resented.

Forty dates have been arranged
so far by the bureau. No mar-
riages have been reported as yet.
but it is rumored that one couple
is going steady.

The bureau keeps its files con-
ﬁdential, so it is difficult to de-
terinine the degree of success with
the new service. However, the
bureau reportsethat all applicants
have expressed approval of their
dates.

The bureau searches especially
for girls who have tickets for af-
fairs‘ or invitations to parties but
who lack escorts. In such cases
needed escorts are chosen from
veterans who are shy‘on ready
cash.

The majority ‘of males who ap-
ply for dates seek girls who have
the same hobbies, interests, and
religion. The female conception
of the perfect date, as evidenced
by their requests, is a tall man
with a ﬂair for scintillating con-
versation and a lively sense of
humor.

Educator Says:

Not Only The cased  

Benefit From ‘College

AUSTIN, Tex., (IP)—-Here’s an
educator who is ready to speak
out in behalf of students who
don’t bring home the best grades.
He is Dr. H. T. Manuel, director
of the Testing and Guidance bu-
reau at the University of Texas
and head of research for the Texas
Commission on Coordination in
Education.

It's wrong, he says, to think that
only the most gifted can benefit
from higher education. He looks
with misgivings on the trend of
Texas colleges" toward enrollment
restrictions and “selectivity,” and
thinks there ought to be some “co-
ordinating” among the institu-
tions of higher learning before
they go too far in that direction.

“Suppose the senior colleges of
Texas were suddenly to say that

Large Wardrobe

no high school graduates from the ‘

lowest half of their classes would
be admitted,” Dr. Manuel said.
“The result would be of immediate
concern not only to the colleges
taking such action, but also to
educators generally and even to

  

the people at large,_to ‘wh
schools are responsible. _

“The problem of youth refused
admission to engineering or med-

restrictions, even though a profes-
sional school may have good rea-
son for choice of applicants it
there are not facilities for all.”
As a solution Dr. Manuel rec-
ommends provision of types of
educational opportunity in suffi-
cient variety and quantity to meet
individuals and social needs, and
the guiding of students into the

-opportunities that will serve best.
