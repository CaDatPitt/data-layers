College, was a visitor at the Alumni
Oflice last, week. “Tom” is havlng
a ‘successful season at Thiel, despite
the fact that he had to tackle Pitt
and Carnegie Tech on successive
Saturdays in the two opening games.
His team which appeared against
the Panthers was green, but well
coached and made a very favorable
impression. The score looked a little
big at the time, but._it looks all the
better as a result Oi the Panthrs’
big victories over West Virginia and
Drake. Incidental} , Thiel scored a
touchdown against Tech, which made
“Tom” feel happy. ,

“II. ‘The little rascals are at it again. , V
‘ Just as sure as‘ Hallowe’en, the naughty chil-

fdren scamper around the campus with their
‘Illttlei paint brushes, and their cute 1ittleV cans

of red‘ paint, daubing hither and thither, glee-

fully skipping from-building‘ to building. With

la, daub of red here, and a splotch of carmine

there, they show their effervescing spirits to I

the wide, wide world. . . _
But let’s grow up. We’ve outgrown 0111'

childhood days when we rang doorbells and

painted scores on people’s windows. Irisliead

we reason, or at least we try to use our heads

for something besides hatracks.

I Saturday Carnegie Institute of Technology

and the University of Pittsburgh will send
rival elevens out to battle on the gridiron, -and

‘neither school will send eleven" men to slink
‘on foreign campuses, paint brushes in hand,
ready to paint the other school red.

 We are frank to voice our disapproval. We _

have no use for the children who splash

paint and run. . We also feel convinced

that no right thinking student or faculty mem-
ber from the school across the way voices
his approval of the actions of , presum-

-ably only ' several Carnegie students.

IWe are sorry it hasdiappened, but we know
that nothing of such a nature, done by so small
.5; ‘percentage of a student body, can posslbly

,,2nar the good feelings existing between the
 two schools; ‘ .

A little paint won’t spoil anything‘. Carnegie-

Neither will a football victory either Way.

But anyhow, let’s grow up;

_ ’ . THEY’RE HUMAN, T00 V
Some students never seem to overcome their

invve of close Contact with their instructors.
2: Entering as freshmen with the impression
that professors are as “soulless” as corpora-
*tions are deemed to be, the student’ is led on
in his belief that the professor is an automaton
which mechanically startsbroadeasting as_soo‘n
.,..»as-the bell rings to begin class and signs off _
 ‘”'as‘ “soon as the bell rings to dismiss class- That.
I . the teacher maybe human also never occurs
 V to some students. .

We are prone to believe that generally‘ the

';I professors have begun to worka reform. More
;I§and- more, dowe ﬁnd an evolution  their de-
Ijnieanor towards their students. They have
 "become human. In appreciation of their true
 _; position as guides in classroomwork, they have
, substituted interesting “thought provokers" in
‘  ;p1}ace of dry-fact-statistics. ’
 The cordiality with which as professor wel-
i§;icomIes his students a in personal interviews

hanges the fear of the student to respect. The
professors really want to know their men and
women on a more intimate basis. In learning‘.
_individual differences and problems of their

1-isptudents, the better i can the professors help

them‘ in their difficulties.

 VzTh_e-‘ burden, however, rests on thestudent.
Know-your professor. Talk to him after class

i or go in to chat with him in his ofﬁce. And it
V’ is not too late forﬂthelupperclassmanvto make
. amends. Why not feel the pleasure in meeting

on a more personal basis our intellectual com-

- panions during our university life?

 
CREDIT MANIACS »

“Gimmea threecredit course in botany; no

 I during the fall’ registration» period.

The present epidemic of wholesale education
has created a large class of such students,
whose course-picking common ‘sense is limited
_to the number of credits involved and the hours

. per week necessary. And Pitt has its quota
.;of these. a V I

To such students the subject matter of the

I course is secondary, and they often enter the

course without an inkling of what confronts
them. Usually a maze of hieroglyphics‘ and
complex terminology transform his class hour»
into sixty minutes of tedious wrist-watch vigil.
The “pre” students of the professional schools
‘are generally the worst afflicted with the
credit-piling . ‘mania. Their action can be
partly justified by the factrthat their greatest
task during‘ undergraduate days is to‘ ,“kill”
time. They usually do, often so thoroughly
that they a graduate with minds no more ef-
ficient than they had when they matriculated,
‘and unequipped to cope with the more difficult a
curriculaof the professional schools.

IN DEFENSE OF THE.
YOUNG INTELLECTUAL

In the Middle Ages the intellectu-

- als were old men with gray beards,
I horned spectacles, and ‘ink under

their ﬁngernails. They were versed
in philosophy, astrology, alchemy,

V and cabalistic devices.I They lived

in stone towers on spiders’ brains
andcanaries’ eyelashes. They per-
formed horrible and gruesome ex-
periments on men's souls. I '
In modern days there are no wise
men who dabble in the scie I and
arts. This is‘ an age of specializa-
tion: consequently, the wise men
write profound treatises on “The
Split Inﬁnitive in Beowulf” or "Hy-
potheses on the Contraction of the
Skins‘ of Overripe Tomatoes.” -The
practice’ of dabbling in arts, sciences
and life has been left to the younger
set. This group is derisively‘— called
by the business man “impractical”;
by the conservative older people,
‘.‘Young'- Snipes,” who don’t know
which side of their bread is but-
tered”; by conscientious church
people, “Scandalous Atheists” and‘,
by everybody in general, . “Smart
Alecks.” I I
The young intellectual is none of

these. He has a distinctive and use-I _
His prime purpose is,

ful function.
to stimulate. intelligence, and to

I teach the world how to live.

Before going further, it would be
well to deﬁne intelligence. A gen-
eral deﬁnition is:

The young intellectual, then, is
one of the sheep endowed with this
peculiar substance known as intel-
ligence. _ Consequently, I when} the

rest of the ﬂock hop over: the stile, ~

he stays behind. Left alone, per-5*
hope he starts by reflecting on this

strange event, then discovers that j

the sight of the sheep huddled to-
gether is quite amusing. If he sud-
denly beginsxroaring in a voice so

powerful as to shockthe ﬂock near-

by, it is only because he rejoicing,
from a healthy feeling Rt comes
of freedom. There-‘is certéinly no
reason for the ﬂock baaing at him.

It is in the university that he is I

most commonly discovered. V There
he has the opportunity touperform
his functions. We have already
stated that one of the young intel-
lectual’s functions is to stimulate in-
telligence. How is one to do that
except by associating himself with
The

and the sciences: astronomy, mathe-

matics, and the various sociological
and philosophical

subjects. We
have already deﬁned intelligence
and by applying‘ that definition to
the above subjects it seems logical
to call them ‘products of file intel-
ligence. - .

Thefyoung intellectual, by his ap-
parently useless dabbling in arts
and sciences, subtly develops his in-
cipient intellect. If he in his turn
can interest other people in a. few
of the things in which he has an

interest, he will be performing one -

of his functions, that of stimulating
intelligence- ’ ‘ ,
The question arises: what is the
young intellectual going to. do with
this intelligence now that he has it?
The intelligenceis the chief instru-
ment in showing the world how to
live. The majority of the world
clamors that it knows how to live
and it doesn’t need any young snipes
to tell it differently. The pathetic
part of it is that the world knows
only how to exist and not how to
live. To LIVE one must get the
most out of existence. This “most”
is obtained when one ﬁnds out that

life consists of more than business 
transactions, newspapers or’ poker .

games.

THE PORTRAIT on THE YOUNG
MAN AS AN INTELLECTUAL,
The discovery of an intellectual_

in the -ranks of the student body is

usually attended with considerable

consternation and distress. About

the same tact is used in dealing with

him as is used by a person who has
unexpectedly come upon a sizzling
bomb. Either he is smothered or
tossed aside to blow up by himself.

Yet there is a word to be said for

. . . r  A .. ._ - jathee intellectual. He is a colorful
rate studegbs “by**number’ °*"’ quﬂdty individual, and therefore interesting.

And ‘he is I colorful because of the’,

' ‘Winter Games‘ _
How pleasant it is to have winter come once more! We haven't
time _to regret summer when the cold snow begins to force on us the
necessity of, a new kind of warmth-a warmth not so ﬁne as,,sunshine,
but more sociable. This is the time when grandfathers love to curl
up beside the ﬁreplace, with their huge, gray meerschaum pipes,
and tell their little grandchildren stories of the frontier days. This
is the time, too,‘when noisy, mischievous boys are satisﬁed to grab
some cushions and pile them in a heap in the corner. As for me, it
is the time when the sizzling tea-kettle makes the most noise, on
these sneaking, biting January nights. These are the evenings when
one enjoys watching the tall, faithful grandfather clock laboring
away in the small hours of the night. I like it now because I can
lean back on the old family rocking chair and enjoy Robinson Crusoe,
or perhaps just listen to the birch logs crackle in the ﬁreplace. Now
it is that Dad gets up from his lounging chair and jestingly reminds
Johnny for me that the wood-box is empty. As he gets up to poke

the ﬁre again I slip into this cozy felt boots and sally forth through
the loose snow to the wood pile.

Starshine _
A moonbeam, shining through a slit behind the window-blind,
cpl-ept slowly down over Jimmie’.-. ‘curly. yellow head and fell full on
his face. Jimmie sighed, squirmed a little, dug chubby ﬁsts into his
‘sleep-heavy eyes and blinked up at the light. “Aw, Mr. Moon,” he

murmured, "go ’way. I wanna sleep.” He turned over on ms side
and snuggled into the pillow, but that persistent mooiibeam wouldn’t
let him close his eyes. With the shaking of the blind in the breeze,
the light danced on the white hill that was Jimmie’s shoulder and
hopped down on the pillow in front of his nose, like an excited elf.
“Get up! Get up!” it seemed to shout. Jimmie, wide awake now,
and feeling just abit excited inside himself, ﬁnally kicked down the
covers and threw his white-pajamaed legs over the side of the bed.‘
In another second he was pattering. across the cold boards and the
white ovals of rag rugs toward the. yellowish gray square that was
the window and was climbing‘ up on the board seat. There, with his
back resting againsta pile of cushions and his knees hugged close .
to his chest, he sat staring out into the summer night. In the sky
the huddled in bunches like pieces, of a Chinese puzzle. They re-

- minded Jimmie of the ice ﬂoes, with great cracks of black water
between the jagged cakes that he had seen in the movies of the
‘North Pole. There were patches of sky, too, where there were no
clouds, only hundreds of twinkling stars that blinked like the ﬁre-

_. flies in Simpson's woods. The moon, hidden under a big cloud, turned
the soft white edges first to a thinsilver line, then to glistening fuzz
that looked to Jimmie like the ﬂames of a far-away ﬁre.

Then, laughing down as if to say, “Aren’t you glad you got up?”
the moon, full and round, bobbed out into a clear pool of sky and
dropped a gauzy silver mantle on the world. Housetops shone in
‘bright squares among the misty blurs that were woods and orchards;
and the curve of the state road, where it rounded Knobby Hill, was
a swirl of sparkling gray paint. Johnson's wheat ﬁeld on the opposite
hill Jimmie’s window seemed covered with a dewy spider-web, and
behind which the trees in the chestnut grove were gray humps a.,gd.lnSt
the sky. And everything was still. Once in a while a cricket chirped,
or a katy-did buzzed its sleepy notes. Leaves rustled in a light breeze
that carried’ the smell of clover from the hayﬁelds and the faint

V odor of honeysuckle that trailed over the front porch. Jimmie leaned
on the window-sill and looked up at a patch of sky that hung over
the edge of the roof. “Gee!” he muttered, “I'm glad we have nights
sometimes.” Then he blew a kiss from his ﬁnger-tips toward a bare
space in the sky, high over his head. As he watched a tiny star
blinked out of the square of blackness and twinkled down on him.

“In a. Convent Garden.

The peace of those long ago Vespers by the lake when the faint
murmur of water breathed an undertone to the Magniﬁcat, when the
sweet odor of incense blended with the scent of spring’s violets, the
peace that comes at twilight Benediction at Holy Innocents drifted
like a soft mist through the gardens of Our Lady of the Elms on that
Sunday afternoon in September. From the high terrace, I watched
the wind sway the poplars that fringe a sheet of water as blue and

' motionless ' as the sky, as placid as the lives throbbing about me.
Only a moment I dreamed on the terrace, for there were pathways
V to explore, orchards where the fruit, mellowed tunder summer suns,
lay ready for harvest, and distant ﬁelds yellow in the warm light.
I had come to meet again those girls whom I had known in my happy
ﬁfth grade days of fractions and spelling rmatches, with whom I had
exchanged rings and lollypops and shot “commies” in the shadow of
V Saint Aug-ustine’s; yet I longed to wander in the distant ﬁeldsrather
- than to see them again. I turned to ﬂee, to seek those cool grottoes
where the ‘Virgin ruled over budding lilies and crystal waters, but
Caroline stood before me, cool, distant, her ﬂaxcn pigtails/’ hidden
beneath her veil. I thought of Caroline of the pudgy ﬁngers and the
Squeeky shoes; I remembered the terror that had - turned her eyes
steel-blue that afternoon when she clung to the church door, hiding
-her head from the lightning. There was something of that steely
blueness in her cold eyes as she held out-a bony arm. -I wondered
vaguely if some terror out of a summer's sky had sent her hiding in
these silent gardens. She was saying things in a far-away voice about
the other girls, calling them the unfamiliar things of their sisterhood. 
She reminded me that I must see them all.- '

I found Mary down by the lily pond, strolling with her family,
who had ,bundle.d into-the Ford to spend the afternoon away from the
crowded porches of First street. Mary. I recalled with the snobbish-.
ness that we Lake Avenue ﬁfth-graders had for ‘the kids that lived
down.by the Sewer Pipe, had come from Hungary, but that Mary of
the faded ginghams was gone. Now she was Sister Dolorosa, a
woman of sorrows who gathered a whole world under the protection
of her prayers. _ I wished at the moment the sweet cadences of her
voice grew into music like the tinkle of the bell during the Elevation
that I might have inspired charcoal to catch the elusive glory of her
face, a beauty that I might gloat over in hours of unhappiness.
Those gardens are for such as Mary whose prayers themselves are
poems, though they are murmured in mingled tongues. , F

I loitered long on the edges of the lake, thinking, longing to see
Rose. In the ivy-covered novitiate, I found her, my Rose. And now
she is some distant God’s. Four nights before we had wandered in
the park as gravely and silently as we had done that autumn evening

her brother was born. Long ago. we shared secrets, but for years
I had forgotten her. plugging away at her music and her sewing.
Nine years had passed since we had sworn eternal friendship; we
had fo1.,’E_0t.ten. I held her warm.- hand close in mine, this little three

De’: Moines Boys Required to
~ Play Defensively During
Entire Game

.  No match for the Golden Pan-
"ﬂtihers was the Drake team on‘ Sat-
Iqjurday and except for a spell in the
. second quarter, Pitt completely out-

played ‘the Western Bulldogs from

in the ﬁrst to the ﬁnish. The score
‘ was 32-0.

‘ ‘ The fact is that Pitt outplayed the

. Drakers to a greater extent than
ﬁve touchdowns. They hammered at St

Drake’s goal line and attempted sev-
eral passes in the fourth quarter
only to lose the ball on downs. It
was evident in the first quarter that
the Pitt team of the vintage of 1927
is one of the smoothest teams ever
built up and set into motion. After

‘ the ﬁrst quarter the only hope the

Western rooters was that their team

1 is _ lwould not be shut off without men-

tion on the scoreboard.
There seemed to be a chance of
this -in the second period when

 Barnes playing fullback for the

Bulldogs received the ball on the
_ ﬁrst play and started in the direc-
_ tion of the Panthers goal line. It
seemed that he had a clear ﬁeld. In
fact he did pass the last defenses of
the Blue and Gold and there was
' nothing ahead of him. But close at
his heels ran “Honey” Guarino
sporting a Pitt uniform and when

' Honey caught up to the Westerner

he dove and clung like a wolf at
the ﬂanks of a deer. That run netted
forty-six yards It was evident that
Barnes was pretty badly banged up

W on the previous plays for after he

had proceeded forty yards he stag-
gered and fell exhausted.
Those'Panthers made their ﬁrst
march to the Drake goal early in
the first quarter. Booth and Welch
battered the Drake line'outside and
inside tackle for fourteen plays to
score the ﬁrst touchdown. Booth
going ﬁve yards through Jones and

1:151 ‘ -Shearer to tally. With Welch hold-
 ing the ball, Booth added the extra

point with a placement kick. With
one marker chalked against them the

 j Drake team held fast and formed a
- strong wall of defense.

Consistent
battering and hammering away

 made the wall hold all the more. Pitt

began to play a tight game\ Then
Booth taking the bail on his own 21,
"broke through left guard and with
perfect interference ‘ran 79 yards for
a touchdown. He was given perfect
assistaiice, with Alex Fox taking out
‘ the last man. Not a single Drake
man was in view when Booth started
his march down the ﬁeld. Booth
would have been safe in walking to
the goal line with the ball. He added
the extra point by way of a place-
ment kick.
The second quarter was a puntiiig

contest with both teams playing a V

watcliiul game. The Drakers pre-
ferred. to kick on the second or
third down and patiently. waited for
some possible chance to score. Welch
made. a third touchdown in the third
quarter after Booth had made heavy

’ yardage from the center of the ﬁeld

on a hidden ball play that sent him
through without interference. The
ball was muffed on an attempted
kick for a point.

The fourth touclidown of the af-
ternoon came when the Pitt team
discovered that the Drake line held

I  " all too well and after two tries at it

decided that it was safer to go over
it with passes rather than through
it with a battering ram. A lateral
pass, Edwards to Welch off Drake’s
right end for 12 yards started the
ball arolling for the fourth marker.
Welch stepping back and picking
his man selected Guarino as the re-
ceiver of a long pass—42 yards
Zvacek of Drake attempted
to weave in a cut it down but the
ball‘ bounced off of his hands and
fell into Guarino’s waiting arms.
Uansa who learned his football at
McKees Rocks went into -the game
_'f0I‘ Welch. With Uansa, Parkinson,
Edwards and Hagan in the back-
field, another march down the ﬁeld
began for the ﬁfth and ﬁnal score
of the game. This quartetgcarried
the ball for practically the entire
length of the ﬁeld- An already bat-
tered team gave way to Uansa in his
mad rush for a fourteen yard gain.
Parkinson carried the ball over the
last two yards for a touchdown.

Des Moines Or Bust!

The brazen audacity of them
dents!

Or better yet, the brazen au-
dacity of three of them last week.

Three Pitt dental students,
Campbell, Scott and Shiring, anx-
ious to see the Pitt-Drake foot-
ball game started out last week
with the 40 odd men composing .
the football party on its trip to
Des Moines. V

When 114 miles out of Chicago,
the trio were tracked down under
the seats of three of the football
men, and at the next station, were
; politely escorted to the door.

A mere matter of 250- miles
meant nothing, for when the game
started that afternoon in walked
the.‘ three dents. Bumming their
weary way onward as well as
back to Pittsburgh, the stow-
aways reached home, after one
had again been caught and made
to pay railroad fare.

The freshman hill and dale club
is rounding up in good shape for
the 'nitial contest of the year. On
Satu day, October 22, Coach Shea’s
yearlings will romp over the Schen-
ley course against the stiff competi-
tion put up by the plaid plebes of‘
Coach Haferty. The yearlings are
going: the full distance now and
are shaping up like veteran spike-
men. The coach is well pleased
with the group as a whole, and es-
pecially the several outstanding
frosh who come here hailed as real
distance men.

' Moore Outstanding

Outstanding among the young-
ers is Gus Moore, a colored lad
from New York. Moore is a fast
miler and is gradually developing-
into one of the smoothest of dis-
tance men. Another of Shea’s
prodigies is Anthony West of Wal-
tham, Massachusetts. West. is one
of the best marathon men who has
ever come from the New England
section and is well primed for the
coming season.

The Pitt ‘swimmers are. hard ‘at
training in preparation for a tough
swimming schedule this season. Pat
Corr, swimming coach, holds prac-
tice for his natators every evening
at 5 o'clock in Trees pool, and a "few
of them are rounding

tain, is the best in the sprint swims
as well as in" the diving events. Pete
Bowen is the fastest breast stroke
swimmer in the University and he
will be counted on to place high in

pionships this season. Last season,

Bowen broke the Intercollegiate ree-
ord for the 220 breast stroke in
practice, but was prevented from at-.
tending the ampitnships due to a
broken wris ‘ which he sustained a
week before. ’

Pitt Football Men Stopped-

 

Press reports from Chicago indi-

immune from the miiiistrations of
the Windy, City Bandit chasers and
bullet dodgers. While encamped in

lix Demoise and Chester Wasmuth

to do a “little window-shopping in
South Chicago. As a cold wind was
blowing. topcoat collars were raised
and hats pulled down about the
ears until but little was exposed.
After some time had passed, the
players were startled by” the ad-
vent of two hard-boiled plain-
clothesmen of the Chicago A police

men were under’ arrest, wanted for
the holdup of a South Chicago
grocery store. After some ﬁve
minutes of furious explanation the
policemen apologized for their er-
ror and the dismayed gridders were
placed in taxies and returning to
their hotel, resolved to window-shop

A A GREAT HALF-BACK

Captain Gilbert (Gibby) .We1ch,
whose football achievements have
startled the country, ﬁrst ﬂashed
across the Pitt football firmanent
in 1925. In the closing days of that
campaign, Gibby ﬁrst gave signs of
the greatness which was to mark
his football career, by his thrilling
dashes and all-around playing. Last-
year, he continued his stellar play-
ing, to turn in an average of better
than one hundred yards gained
per game. This year, his playing
has been up to its usual standard,
although hehas been playing under
ahandicap. His run of 105 yards
against West Virginia, e ualling
e e mark set by Jimmy Be an in
1912 against the Navy, show him to
be a real speed merchant with an

in

and dodging.

Welch’s style of playing is quite
like that of the famed Red Grange,
several of whose marks he threatens
to equal or surpass. Like the Whea-
ton ice-monger, Gibby’s principal
assets are, the ability to get up
speed quickly, which is invaluable
in line plunging, an ability to pivot
easily while traveling at top speed
and an uncanny accuracy in han-
dling the ball. At throwing and
receiving’ forward passes he easily
surpasses that of Grange while his
sure footedness‘ makes him equally
effective» on a muddy ﬁeld. Defen-
sively his speed again is an asset
so that he again equals Grange in
this branch. Although he h_as al-
ways entered. games as‘ a marked
man, Gibby continues to gallop
away to greater successes.
