C1Vll« Rights

By LARRY ABERNFIELD

The University Law School
faculty 2 has petitioned the
United States Senate, to pass
the House of Representa-
tives’ Civil Rights Bill. .

S u c h _ meaningful legislation,
the petition reads, will enable all
citizens of the United States to
live in dignity and work in har-

American ideal. .

Law School Dean Thomas M.
Cooley announced that this pe-
tition, signed by the entire ‘full-
time faculty, has been submitted

as a counterweight against the
heavy writing campaign opposing’

_This “Declaration of Conscience”
has been forwarded to both Penn-

local members of the House of
Representatives. Dean "Cooley re-

I Debate in G-ustine’s
l  Over Cyprus Issue

By LARRY BERNFELD
An enthusiastic audience. packed into the back rooms of Gustine’s
Wednesday evening to hear two knowledgeable and ﬂuent University
I graduate students, one a Greek Cypriot, the other a Turkish National,
_ debate “the Cyprus question.” _

Alkis A. Kantos, the Cypriot studying for his political science
doctorate, argued for an independent Cyprus which guaranteed the
‘Turkish minority rights without allowing the minority community to
paralyze the effectiveness of the Makarios government.

Neylan Akra, a doctoral candidate in the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs, defended the Turk Cypriot position
from her educated viewpoint as‘ a Turkish National.

I present Cyprus constitution has proven unworkable, Miss Akra feels
its continuance is necessary to maintain security, and for se1f-pres-
ervation of the Turkish community.

“The situation is ridiculous,” the acrid Miss Akra exclaimed,
“the outgrowth ofpolitical romanticism” and the emotional instiga-

‘ tions of the charasmatic leader of the Greek community, Archbishop-

President Makarios.

Kantos cogently presented the Greek Cypriot views of the ﬁght-
ing on the island as a “symptom of the non-working constitution
which paralyzes the Greek majority” by giving the Turks an abso-
lute veto, over the affairs of the military, the economy and national

security.

A superior confrontation, the debate, like the real Cyprus con-
ﬂict, seemed to end in an insolvable draw because of the basic
positions on which neither side will make the compromisespnecessary

for-«a true solution to take place.

 

To many Americans
Vietnam is only a name i
the news — another of the '
world’s many trouble spots,'§~
but to Major Arthur E. _I
Brown, it means much more.»
For he served as an advisor‘
to a Vietnamese Civil Guard 3
Battalion in the Mekong
Delta just before coming to
Pittsburgh. He is now at
tending the University's
Graduate School of Public
‘and International Affairs
(GSPIA) under the Army
Civil Schooling Program.

Major Brown completed
his undergraduate studies at
West Point in June, .1953,-’
and was commissioned a
second lieutenant’ of In-
fantry. Since that time he
has served in‘ command, 3
staff, and instructor positions both in the United
States and in Germany.‘ He graduated from the
Army Command and General Staff College at Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas, In June, 1962, and then was
sent to Vietnam Ior -a year.

In'tVietnam he was stationed in Vinh Binh
Province which is approximately 60 air miles
‘ south of Saigon. There he advised the Civil Guard

Previous t_6 winning the Bronze star, Major
Brown was awarded the Army Commendation
Medal for heroism in action in connection with
the location, security, and evacuation of a U. S.
helicoper which fell in Viet Cong territory. Major
Brown described ‘the situation‘ in these words:
“Early one evening we received a call that a heli-

er of the English language ‘and
general linguistics but has worked
to emphasize the need for the De-
partment of Linguistics. »
Linguistics is like a science in
the need for a basic understand-
ing of ‘the fundamentals and in
the continuity of courses. But it is
part of Humanities in its dealing
with the people and countries of
the world, according to Dr. -
Fraenkel.

coper had gone down in or near the Co Chien t

 

River (a major outlet of

the Mekong), the northern
boundary of our province.
our main tasks were to
ﬁnd the helicopter, evacu-

i ate -any injured crew
members, and secure the
wreckage before the Viet
Cong, could respond. Once
the wreckage ‘was secure,
American recovery teams
would‘ prepare it, for
evacuation.”

“We traveled up the river
with ‘about 40 men in two
boats and commenced the
search. The principle prob-
lems we faced were being
mistaken for enemy 5 troops

above and runninginto a
VC force larger than ours.

 
   

materialized, and we found the wreckage about 3

a.m. on an island in the river. ,
“Unfortunately no’one survivedithe crash~and

once the evacuation ofuthe dead was effected, we,

- were confronted with the task of securing, the

wreckage until it could be evacuated. Although
the helicopter was destroyed beyond future use,
the wreckage had to be evacuated as the Viet
Cong could use it for’ propaganda and then strip
the metal ‘for use in locally produced mines. The
entire ‘operation took three days and while the
Viet Cong are usually notcapable of quickly as-
sembling ‘a large unit under circumstances such as
this, the longer you wait, the more likely they are
to assembleoneiand attack.” - .

After looking back 'in;‘_retrospect, Major Brown
analyzed his present position. “I’m pretty close to
what you'd» call" mid—career. Studying there under
the Army’s program is a way of gaining new in-

_sights on one’s career, as well as ‘gaining knowl-

edge which will possibly be of value to the Mili-
tary Establishment. ‘

The appealing, earthy ‘charac-

ably the most distinctly American
hero in the theater. He is the des-
ucendent of Rip ‘Van Winkle and
Tobacco Road and dates ‘back.to
the first American comedy, “The
Contrast” in 1787. He is lazy and
uncomplex, the frontier instinct
who always _manages to blunderl
into triumph over ‘the sophistica-
tion of the city—slicke1‘.
Carr is a great talent in this
comic tradition and the chance to
see him should not be missed.

he cried shaking his head in disbelief at
my stupidity. “The biggest problem
facing students is the problem of Sex!

 at the answer.”

“Oh! do tell me. about it,” I said clap-

 ppingmy hands together‘ in gleeful expecta-

tion. '

And he did tell me. And this is my
friend’s solution. '

According to him, the reason why stu-
dents receive poor grades in their courses
is because they are sexually frustrated, and
that if they were sexually satisﬁed they
would get better grades and everyone

(would graduate summa cum laude. A

pleasent thought, you must admit.

Well, he says, since this be the case
the proper solution would be the estab-
lishing of a system whereby every stu-
dent who acquires a 3.75 QPA or over for
a term would be permitted to select the
roommate of his choice from the opposite

' sex.for the following trimester. This ar-
rangement would be ’renewable — a
change of roommates would be allowed
for each term, though no mid-term
switching would be permissable — pro-
viding the student maintained, at least a
3.25 overall QPA. "

My ﬁrst question concerning his pro-
posal was what would be the effect upon a

- poor student who was_chosen by one of the

this hurt the poor student’s grades even

more, but my friend explained that this —

was the beautyof the system for by living
with an intellectual and, being sexually
satisﬁed at the same time the poorer stu-
dent’s grades would necessarily go up, and
after a term or so, he or she might even
have a high enough QPA to pick his own
roommate.

After one term of diligent study, a stu-
dent would never again have to worry
about his sex life, and would be able to
continue his studies at the same fervent
pace throughout the rest of his college
career. ‘

. Not only, my friend claims, would the
resident studentsbeneﬁt from his proposal
but the University would beneﬁt in'that
more students would want to come here to

‘school and more commuters would want to

live in the dorms. ..
Only if a student is picked as a room-
mate by two or 'more scholars would he
have a choice as to which one he wants
to live with. A brilliant system like this

one cannot afford to be subjugated, my '

friend contends, to any old-fashioned
ideas of chastity. If students feel that
way they should go to Duquesne.

Of course, he is the ﬁrst to admit that
his proposal will have a hard time being
acceptedby the-University chaplains and

the administration, but he feels that Chan-’

cellor Litchﬁeld is a liberal and knowl-
edgeable young man and that he will con-
sent to the proposal once he becomes aware
of all its beneﬁts:

In conclusion I should like toladd that I.

do not give my wholehearted endorsement

it carefully enough. However, his is a rev-
olutionary idea which does deserve airing.

‘ W :36/KLITIFUL MODE l.._ UP IN YOUR ROOM-

Room 3Z7,.Where Are’Ycu?. V o
I A Classroom   C ufs  
‘  By. Larry Bernfeldpi

Who ever heard of a classroom not showingup for class? I mean,
it’s common enough when a student is absent, or even when a

teacher is “unavoidably detained.” But usually, a classroom makes

the scene even when its human counterparts_ do _not.

Friday morning May 8, started off in its usual manner. My’.

English Lit classroom remained right where it was supposed to have
been —- in Langley Hall“. But my_ eleven a.m. Econ classroom must
’ have had abad "morning. It was supposed to have
been in’ 327 CL, but when the class got there, the
“Rise of New Classicism” was there in place of
Microeconomics recitation. ,

Bewildered, ﬁve aspiring economists began a
room-to—room search of the third ﬂoor, but our
.recitation classroom had virtually disappeared-.

When Sue Okurowski, Danny Katz, Fred
Yolton, Bob Mross and I walked into Mrs. Picker-
ing’s Information Office and confronted her with
 » our problem, she had to admit that a ready solu-
tion didn’t exist. After all, her daily ‘work consists of answering rela-
tively easy questions, like who was assistant chief of the grounds
crew in 1937.

But Mrs. Pickring wasn’t long in getting to the heart of the
problem. A call to student records determined that our classroom '
had moved from 327 .to 319. Not that we had any knowledge of

  

this classroom transfer. For 319 was not our previous recita-tion_

room, nor was it our lecture room. Nor did this transfer account '
for the English Lit class in 327. Of this, Student Records. had
no record. ,

The ﬁve wandering Economists then checked out 319. If this
was the classroom, then where was the teacher? We had called
Dithridge House and the Economics Department secretary told us
that our instructor had already left for "class. '

What she didn’t tell us was how our instructor was supposed to
ﬁnd us. After all, the iact that our recitation classroom was now

A in 319 was a secret shared only by Student Records, Mrs. Pickring,

and the ﬁve wandering Micro students.

As far as the Econ department was concerned, our recitation was

scheduled for either 314 or 327. (Professor Paul Samuelson of MIT,
the author of our textbook, is the ﬁrst to admit that Economics is
still not; an exact science.) The misunderstanding, however, was no

fault of the department. After all, both 314 and 327 were originally .

and rightfully assigned to them. ‘ A
Now it would seem that we had made a full and conscientious
effort to ﬁnd our missing recitation. The mystery behind its dis-
appearance remained somewhat of a puzzle. Being‘ diligent stu-
dents, however, we solved our problem with the insight of well-
disciplined beginning economists. _
We had an effective demand for one Economics recitation session.
The combined shortrun supply schedules of available classrooms and
instructors was at no point able to satisfy the minimum quantity
demanded. ' _ A A
The question arose then, where was the supply?
We could only conclude that the supply problem

. _. , was the result of some inefficiency due to a» large
  element of . imperfect knowledke. Complete eﬂi-_-

ciency, in Economics (as in most other ﬁelds) re-
quires perfect knowledge.

The “Oﬁice of Classroom Allotments” had im-
perfect knowledge of the-distribution of classrooms.
This resulted in less—than-complete efficiency. (In
this respect, the University "could beneﬁt from the
knowledge of beginning economics — perfect.
knowledge, therefore the highest level of efﬁciency.)

Our situation could then be described ‘as a
non-existent supply, unable to meet an 11;30 a.‘rn.,:

AL HOMBURG _
Kt'ng’s Talent

_ By Sherman Canter
“Pretty good turnout

for a
Spring P.lVI'. program,” rem'arked
Jean Adamchic, chairman of the
PM Planning comrnittee for the
third trimester. “We were espec-
ially impressed by the large turn- .
out of faculty and staff.”

‘.‘Not so,” said Sandy Levine
L.A. Senior. “Too many dorm stu-
dents who might have been inter-
ested in this type of program were
not present.” .

Whatever the size of the audi
ence, those" who missed John Reed
King’s Talent Teams_May 20 in
the "Student Union‘ Ballroom miss-
ed a pretty enjoyable show.-

Mr. King introduced the _‘pro-
gram by conducting an experi-
ment which supposedly proved
_women’s superior extra-sensory
powers. He ciialienged both men
_and women to guess the date on
a silver dollar he held in his
hand, whereupon Tama Lewis,
an Education Junior and the
ﬁrst woman to venture a guess,
‘ came up with the correct date -
1923. She received the dollar as
reward for her remarkable feat.
But Miss Lewis’ pride soon
turned to dismay when she dis-
covered the actual date on the
coin to be 1885.

Al I-Iomburg opened the musical
section of the program. A folk
singer of great talent, he captured
the attention of the audience im-
mediately with a beautiful rendi-

tion of “Mariah.” He continued
his repetoire with such effective
songs as “Delia,” and “Jamaica
Farewell.”

The Harmoni—Kings were next
in the lineup of the evening’s en-
tertainment. Their arrangements
of “Never on Sunday,” “On the
Street Where You 'Live”' and
“Granada,” were original and per-
formed with expert skill, much to
the delight of, the audience.

After the Harmoni-Kings, Mr.
King again took over the stage
with more comical nonsense.

of a memory test tried by three

By FRANK SMIZIK
The theme of many old sports

E movies is to win the last meet
it for. the sick coach, and that's
'-exactly what the Panther track
 _.team did Saturday as they
 downed Morgan State, 79-70.
 .Track coach Carl Reesvwas strick-

én suprisingly the day before the

-',took—ove’r for the ailing Rees and

will continue to do so until Ree’s

 , status is determined The severity

of his attack and his complete
recovery will be the determining
factors as to whether Rees will
be able to return to coaching.
All the troubles of .the track
team add to the signiﬁcance of
Saturday’s win. Sprinter Bill Del-

 Vecchio and hurdler Joe Friend
both are out with injuries. De1Vec-

chio is still bothered by the ham-
string muscle which he reinjured
in the Ohio University meet two

I « weeks ago. Friend cracked a bone

in his leg while participating in
the broad jump. Luddy Hayden
second best hurdler on the team

» V. was’ limited to the broad jump

and triple jump against Morgan
State. -

Pitt still had Al Thomassey,
though, and he came through
' with 22 points to lead the Pan-
. ther. He took ﬁrsts in the dis-
cuss, shot put, javelin, and the
hammer throw .while trying
for second in the ‘pole’ vault.
If he ‘could only run he could
be his own track team. ‘

Morgan State had some out-
standing sprinters and hurdlers,
‘but couldn’t do anything in the
distance races. The Panthers took
all three_ places in the 880-yard
run with Don Hinchberger, Jim
Studnicki, and Bob Henry all
ﬁnishing in 1:58.0. The same
thing was true in the three mile
race where no one from Morgan
State completed and Steve Waslo,
Ralph Basinski, and John Bailey
tied for ﬁrst with a time of 16:50.

In the mile Bailey, who ran
both the mile and three mile race
took ﬁrst place. He ran it in 4:20.3
edging out teammate Dave Eich-
enlaub by one-tenth of .a second
with Raymond Ivey of Morgan
State third. Ivey was the only man
to place in either the half-mile or
three mile runs for the visitors.

It was a different story however
in sprints and hurdles. Panther
Dick Crout was just edged in the

Kent State Provides
Opposition Today
For Baseball Team

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ
Pitcher Roger Johnson will try, to get the Panther base--
ball team back on the winning track today at Kent State,
but it will be no easy task as the Golden Flashes own an
18-2 mark. ' ’ " S

The Panthers continued their losing ways Saturday as
a disputed. umpire’s call and a ﬁve-hit pitching performance by
Duque_sne’s'Bob Wirth gave the Dukes a 10-3 victory.

_The Dukesscored six runs in the ﬁfth inning to ensure their '
" win. All the runs came with two outs after a disputed play. With

two outs, a slow grounder rolled between Panther starter Dave
Blyshak", and ﬁrst baseman Brian Fisher. Blyshak picked up the ball
and waved Fisher to ﬁrst base. ,, A
Blyshak then threw the ball to Fisher. The umpire, standing
on the third base side_ of the pitcher’s mound," about 80 feet away,
calledithe runner safe at ﬁrst base. The next six batters in a -row
got eithenhits‘ or_ walks. V

Wirth doubled -with two on, and second baseman Fran, Caricatol

tripled, driving in two runs. .
.At- the end‘ of the, fifth inning, the Dukes were already plan-

 ning their night’s entertainment. Their ballgame was over.

But/the Panthers were not._thro’ug'hyet. They still had a couple

[ of _,mistakes to make. With one out in the seventh inning, Ferd Sauer
 walked ‘and George Prussin ‘followed Sauer with a‘ _single. But on _

the play, Sauer tried to--go to third base, 'and..was thrown" out.’
Instead of the Panthers having runners on ﬁrst and second
-with one out, they had a runn_er=- on ‘second base with two out,‘
' Prussin having taken second on the play on Sauer. First baseman
L Brian Fisher then ‘followed with an inside the park home run
to left ﬁeld. V ' . '

Coach Bobby Lewis, however, didn’t blame Sauer. “He’s
only _a sophomore," Lewis said. “I guess kids willmake mistakes. It
hurt‘ us sure, but I guess it happens sometimes.” ' 7

Another .player felt that Sauer’s actions reﬂected the team’s play
all year. “Those things always happen to us,” another said. “I guess
that's the difference between losing and winning." But it really gets
you. down to be on ailosing team, and once you start losing, it's
tough to be up for a- game."

When baseball coach Bobby Lewis recites
the batting averages of his starting lineup he
sounds like John Michelosen giving the
‘weights of his ﬁrst team.

The averages go like this: Brian Fisher, .240,

Steve Eiseman, .222; Larry Szykowny, .194;
Jim Yedlicka, .176; Tim Grgurich, .200; and
,Dave Reichenbach, .194.
Michelosen would never
give catcher Doug Cham-
.ber_s’ average, but Bill‘-
Lickert, of the McKees—
port Little Tigers, might.
' Chamber is hitting .111.
The - only two play-
ers on the team who are’
v'~. hitting well above their
. weight are Fred Maz-
urek (.383) and Barry
Wetzel (.336).
DESPITE THESE
weak averages Lewis BOB SMIZIK
can do little to revamp the "lineup because he
has almost nothing in the way of reserves.
“Just about the only reserves we have,” Lewis
sadi, “are George Prussin and Ferd Sauer.
We’ve tried to use Sauer a little but he’s inex-
perienced. I’m thinking about giving Prussin
a chance in the outﬁeld.”

 

Record Drops to 5-8 A‘

   

 

Pi a yers Barely Hit Their We ight , 

Prussin is an inﬁelder and why Lewis wants
to use him in the outﬁeld where Mazurek and
Wetzel, hold down two of the spots is not
readily understandable. This is especially true
when a look is taken at the averages of the
four players Lewis has been using at second
base, shortstop and third base — Eiseman,
Szykowny, Yedlicka and Reichenbach.

The only place Prussin could be used is _in
right ﬁeld where Grgurich holds forth.
Grgurich is the team’s ﬁfth leading hitter so
this makes Lewis’ ideal all the less'understand-
able. . V

LEWIS IS at a loss to explain wha_t’s wrong
with the team’s hitting. “One thing is for sure,
we practice it enough,” he said, “Maybe the
bats are getting too heavy for the boys,’? but
we’ll be back out there today‘practicing_again.”

To make the low averages on the teanf
even worse, too many of, the players aren’t
hitting the ball at all. Lewis said, “We’re
striking out way too much. Why against West
Virginia if we had been able to hit the ball in
the ninth inning we may have won. But we’re

- striking out too much and when you strike out
you can’t advance a runner and this hurts the~

attack.” .
One place where Lewis‘ will not make a

change is at catching -where the ‘team’s weakest’

hitter, Chambers, is the starter. Lewis fairly

    
 
  
  

 

players just aren’t good hitters and won’t be ;

gushes when he talks about Chambers’ defen-
sive work and with good reason.

West Virginia has _the leading base stealer
in collegiate baseball on their team, but Chain-'
bers threw him out the three times he attempt- ’
ed to steal against the Panthers. Chambers has
also picked ﬁve men oﬁ ﬁrst base, according to‘
Lewis. ‘

either, but he has-been disappointed by then’

West Virginia Tops Mitters, ,6-4
The Panther baseball team dropped its
‘ fourth game in a row last Tuesday when

they lost to West Virginia by a 6-4 score.
The loss was given to Panther pitcher
Roger Johnson» who started the Forbes Field
ball game. ,

The Panthers had’ the bases loaded in the
bottom of the ninth -inning when.shortstop Larry
Szykowny struck out to end the ball game.
Mountaineer right hander Charles Wallace, who
struck out, Szykowny, came into the ball game

in the seventh inning, and saved the win for
starter Vaughn Kovach.

‘ One ‘run had already been scored in the
ninth when Kovach got left ﬁelder Barry Wet-
zel to ground out, and got third baseman Jim
Yedlicka to pop up. Wallace then walked right
ﬁelder Tim. Grgurich intentionally to load the

‘bases. Szykowny, the next batter, struck out.

Johnson started the game for the Panthers,

but only managed to pitch ﬁve innings. In

West Virginia picked up their final two runs
against right hander Carl Oettinger. Oettinger
got only one man out, while‘ giving up two
runs and walking one batter.

Lee Bryeckel, the Panthers’ top relief pitch-
er, then replaced Oettinger, and gave up no

The Panthersﬂhave now lost four games. in a‘
row to the Mountaineers. They lost two‘ games
last year, and two this year. Mountaineer pitch-
ers struck out 28 Panthers this year in 18 inn-
ings,iand yielded only 11 hits.

Panther coach Bobby Lewis says nine hits a
game will win most games. He seems to be _
correct. The Panthers are losing, and they are
not getting nine hits.

 IBM Reveals New Technique
 Make Giant Laser Pulses

A new technique for producing very short, powerful pulses of
L} light from a ruby laser has been discovered by scientists of Interna-
Wtional Business Machines Corporation. The technique produces _so-
called giant laser pulses with extremely simple and convenient ap-
, paratus. It will thus facilitate the use of lasers for such experimental

speed photography. .

To produce giant pulses, a small cell containing a solution of one
0 of several metal-organic compounds calledphthalocyanines is placed
 between the end of the laser and onexof-its mirrors.  -
A The solution strongly absorbs light of the frequency emitted by
in ruby laser. This absorption prevents net ampliﬁcation of light
, untila much larger proportion of chromium ions in the ruby crystal
‘ ; have been pumped to the upper energy state than is normally re-

'quired to make such lasers operate, -

.3 "As the pumping energy input increases to the point where am-
.. pliﬁcation -in the ruby overcomes the loss due to absorption in the
gphthalocyanine solution, the laser begins to emit coherent .light

f‘bleach” the phthalocyanine solution so that it suddenly becomes
'_‘. , almost perfect transparent to the ruby light. At this instant, there
_',is, suddenly a large net ampliﬁcation and all the stored energy in the
 ‘ruby is emitted as a giant pulse. .. _ -
 After the pulse, the phthalocyanine solution returns quickly to
'  its absorbing state, ready for formation of another giant pulse.
5  Previous methods of producing giant pulses have required such
devices as rapidly rotating mirrors or Kerr cells. These devices are
relatively compl'icated and cumbersome, and they require substantial
. ainounts of auxiliary equipment. The new technique requires only a
‘ simple cell ﬁlled with the phthalocyanine solution,‘ and produces giant
pulses automatically without additional equipment or controls.

_ Bleaching of the metal phthalocyanines occurs through satura-
tion or the absorption at the ruby emission frequency. Because of
 the large cross section of phthalocyanine molecules for capturing ruby
light, only a relatively small number of molecules are required per
unit volume of solution. For this reason, saturation occurs very
 rapidly, and the solution is very transparent when bleached.

In a typical experiment (see photo), the solution is contained in a
»_ 3cm long cell with windows at each end. The cell is placed between

an uncoated (“Rooftop”) ruby laser crystal and a fairly high reﬂec-
_’tivity mirror. The so1ution’s concentration is adjusted to transmit 50

per cent of the ruby light at low light levels. When the ruby laser is
I pumped to the point at which it normally would start to lase without
the phthalocyanine solution, a giant pulse of about 20 nanoseconds
duration occurs instead. . . .

Turbine Cars to Use
New Heat Exchangers

Two unique "glass-ceramic discs, with cores that look something
like a honeycomb, are expected to"serve, as regen'erati_ve heat ex-
changers in a gas turbine engine being developed for the Le Mans
24-Hour Race. in ~ .

Some of the engine details werelreleased in, England by_ the
Rover Company Limited and the Owen Organization, builders of the

"revolutionary vehicle. They reported that the car will utilize ‘a re-

generative gas turbine now under development as a power plant for
the first time in a racing car. a l l  . . .

A Rover B.R.M., using a free turbine engine (no heat-exchanger),
won a special prize at Le Manslast year for completing the grueling

24-hour run at an average speed of nearly 108 miles per hour, much ' '

better thanthe required average of 93.225 mph.
This year, with a regenerative turbine engine, and allowed
only the same maximum amount of fuel as other cars in its cate-
gory, the Rover B.R.M. is entered to compete directly in the two-
liter class with pistonengine cars.

A heat exchanger utilizes waste heat from the exhaust of a
turbine, thus allowing signiﬁcant fuel economy. This feature is im-
portant in.a long race, for it reduces the number of time-consuming
pit stops. _ . _ . i —

Each of the heat exchangers is a disc, 17.5 inches in diameter and
"three inches thick. The outer rim and the inner hub of the exchanger
are solid glass-ceramic. The core of the disc is a cellular structure,
made. of the same glass-ceramic, with the cell passages running
through the .thickness of the disc. /The cellular structure and the
solid glass-ceramic are fused together by a glass-ceramic bonding
agent. ' ’ ‘ .

When hot exhaust, gases from the turbine are passed through
the rotating heat exchanger, a portion of it becomes hot. That por-
tion of‘ the exchanger then rotaes into the engine's streamof cool
Intake air. Thus, the intake air becomes pre-heated before it enters
th combustion chamber, thereby increasing turbine efficiency.

The singular features of the Cercor~heat exchanger are that

the glass-ceramic materials don’t change ‘shape, fracture or fatigue

' under the constant, extremely wide temperature 'changes that

they encounter in_ the engine. Also, the heat exchanger is light-
weight, and inexpensive. -

It was less than 18 months ago that Corning announced that
development of gaseousiheat exchangers had moved from the labora-
tory stage, after about a decade of research, to product design stages.
Since then, the company said, its engineers have’ worked with vir-
tually every major turbine development group in ‘the world. I

ographic Institute is perfecting
the submarine for the United
States Navy. T 7‘

IIT’s project, directed by Dr.
T. Paul Torda, professor of me-
chanical and aerospace engineer-
ing, is to evaluate the submarine’s
stability when it is surfaced in
turbulentseas. “We know Alvin
is stable in calm‘ weather, but
we must determine whether it
can surface in very choppy seas
. if not, it will be useless as
a tool‘ for conducting oceano-

~ graphic research, since men and

instruments must move in and out
of it" even in rough weather,"
Torda said. ~

Torda and the students are
testing a model of Alvin, scaled
‘to one-quarter size, but retain-
ing the same weight distribution
as the actual vessel. Therefore,

gwhen, the model is partially sub-

merged, waves affect it in the

conditions would affect Alvin.

High School are cooperating with
IIT in the project, and prelimin-
ary tests are being conducted in

Evanston students .are working
on the project with IIT under-
graduate and graduate students.
“This project gives students an

search is all about. Nobody yet
knows how Alvin will work, so
students can’t follow their usual
pattern of looking up the an-

‘swers in a book,” Torda said.

Final tests will be conducted

Training Station on Lake Michi-
gan, Where the lake has surface
conditions similar to the ocean's

GE Demonstrates Nuclear Fusion

of light marked the ﬁrst public
demonstration of a nuclear, fusion
reaction at the -General_Electric .
pavilion, New York World’s Fair.

The demonstration, a plateau in
-over seven years of fusion re-
search, takes place-. in about 6
milliseconds and is recorded by
oversized instrumentation
surrounding the exhibit. The pub- -
.lic_ display will be repeated every-
6 minutes during the days the
Fair is open.
_ The reaction utilizes 30 billion
watts of electricity which is stored
in giant capacitor banks and re-
leased into magnetic coils located
under a transparent dome. The
magnetic ﬁeld "(surrounding the
coils) then compresses a deute-
rium (heavy hydrogen) plasma
inside a large quartz tube, caus-
ing the atoms to collide, fuse and
release free energy in the form
of neutrons. Energies equivalent
to 100,000,000 degrees F. are re-
leased inthe process.

Fusion, as explained by Dr.
Henry Hurwitza the theoretical
physicist who heads the Gen-
eral Electric thermonuclear re--
search program, is the joining
of light atomic nucli such as
those of deuterium, ‘whereas
fission is the splitting of heavy
atoms, such as uranium or plu-
tonium. Both types of reaction
release very large amount of
energy. Fission is the process,

by which nuclear reactors pro-
duce heat for powering atomic
electric-generating plants and
modern nuclear-powered ships.
Fusion is hopefully the power

source of the future. Its outnut
potential is much. greater than
that of ﬁssion and the fuel source
is cheap and plentiful. A gallon
