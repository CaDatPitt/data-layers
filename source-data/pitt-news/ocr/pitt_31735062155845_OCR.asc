There was standing room

only at the Religion-in-Life

convocation Monday morning in the Commons Room as Rab-

bi Solomon Freehof told stude

nts that the person who con-

fronts a changing world must ﬁrst confront himself. He must

face reality and learn to cope

with it, Dr. Freehof said.

After the‘ invocationat 10:30 a.m. by Chaplain Emory
Luccock, and- introductory remarks by Vice-Chancellor

Charles B. Nutting, Rabbi Freehof,°

of Rodef Shalom Congregation ad-
dressed an estimated gathering of
1000 on the theme of this year’s
conference, “I Confronaa chang-
ing World.”

During college life especially,
Dr. Freehof stressed, the lines of

color, race and religion should be 3

crossed. “We will gravitate toward
our own particular groups soon
enough after college,” he said.

As SC Debates Sports‘

By IRV ROTHMAN
Pitt student John Perri, Col. ’55, berated Student'Con-
gress for lack of initiative in IM sports, at a meeting Mon-
day, Feb. 24. He spoke to the solons concerning the “pathetic”
sports situation here. Perri referred to the disorganized Inter-
Fraternity bowling league and independent participation

especially. _

Congress members took the de-
fensive to show that the IM sports
picture, if poor, was due not to
SC, but rather to the interest of
each individual student. They
stated that athletic facilities are
available to all students, but are
not being used.

Sam Granowitz felt that the
matter should be placed directly
in the hands of the athletic de-
partment. Said Granowitz, “If re-
vision is needed, (in the present
set-up) it is not up to SC, but
for independents to speak to Mr.
Bemis.”

For a clearer, understanding of
the sports picture the Pitt News
interviewed Capt. Tom Hamilton,
director of athletics, and L’. C.
Bemis, director of intramural
sports. Both felt that any existing
problem concerning participation
was due to lack of interest.

Capt. Hamilton referred to the
yellow “Intramural Sports Hand-
book" issued by the athletic de-
partment in the fall and distribut-
ed to freshmen in February. Over
3,000 copies have been handed out
listing facilities, requirements for
participation, areas of competi-
tion, and regulations. They are
available at the dean of men’s of-
ﬁce or the athletic department.

Summing up he said, “any stu-
dent can come up anytime to the
ﬁeld house to play basketball.
squash, handball, or to wrestle.”

Capt. Hamilton expressed dis-
apointment that the construction
of the field house has not devel-
oped as much interest in athletics

as the department had hoped for.
But he emphasized that the ﬁeld
house is open to Pitt students
everyday, including Saturday and
Sunday. .

Bemis stated that any obvious
failure in Intramural sports is due
to the students themselves. He
cited the formation of an Intra-
mural board of students in Sep-
tember.

Consisting of representatives
from MC, SC, Pharmacy School,
IF council, E & M Association,
and Independents-at—large, the
board had big plans for the com-
ing year. However, the members
“sought greener fields,” said
Bemis, “and quickly lost ‘their in-

espuir. . . or “Hope ?

Despair seemed the order of the day'Monday as Dr.
Solomon B. Freehof delivered the convocation address to
Religion in Life Week at Pitt. Rabbi Freehof’s statement
that, “Belief in the inevitable onward march of the human
race is virtually lost,” served to carry out the premise that
the majority of people utilize spiritual values only on Sun-
day and immediately drop back into their materialistic

. -ruts of self indulgence for another week. And ...yet we need

not surrender to complete despair for, as Rabbi Freehof put
‘it, “Hypocracy is the compliment that vice pays to vir-
‘ tue.” Those who despair are using the mechanism of es-
cape to get away from reality, They are unsuccessful in
their escapism but still they persist for these‘ people are
those who are alone, without hope and, according to Rabbi
/Freehof, “This is no kind of a world in which to be alone.”
Yet, are we actually living in a time which is worse than
any gone before? Rabbi Freehof himself pointed out the
debauchery which prevailed in the “Roaring Twenties.”
The people of the United States came through those times
‘ even though they .had presumably sunk _to the depths of
despair. Our “Changing World” is no worse than the “roar-
ing twenties.” Rabbi Freehof holds little hope of reward

 for virtue in .this life yet virtue contains within its bounds

reward enough for all who still hope. We imust commit

ourselves, according to Rabbi Freehof, to either “despair .

or hope.” Those who despair “. .'Walk in an eternal
night.” Those who hope “. . ._walk toward the dawn of

;,days.” In a worldof tragedy all suffer. But to what de-
gree? Those most closely connected with “Religion in Life”
must realize the impact of the Spiritual uponthis black,
materialistic world in which we live. That as long as there
is the Spiritual, there will be hope. Yes, we all-confront a
changing worldbut we are not martyrs! The world has
been changing for a lot longer than we have been‘ con-
fronting it! ' . I o

' Nice to see the effects of sorority rushing Monday night.
Sorority gals were out _in the areas in‘ front of their houses

waiting for “silence” to end and they let off some of the

high spirits by singing, snake-dancing and bunny-hopping
over the Oakland area. When the silence was over, it-was

.worth your life to stand in front of a sorority house as-

the new pledges came rocketing across town from the Ca-
thedral and the actives rolled down the streets to lmeet
them. The ensuing meeting was often quite a shock but
nobody seemed to mind. If the spirit thus displayed can
be carried over through the rest of the college days, it will
 prove valuable asset to the Greek society system and a ﬁne
-boost to school spirit.

What or Rielig'ioﬁ,-in-Life?

By TIM KOVAIE

Last week we asked “What of Religion-In‘-Life” 

and got quite a few answers to the question, in-
cluding a brief reference by_Vice-Chancellor Nut-

- ting at the convocation Monday and an implied

reference from Rabbi Freehof at‘ the same affair.
Perhaps it accomplished its purpose. It stimu-

lated some serious thinking on the subject and

gave a new idea of conversation -

ings this week.— On the other
hand, the article may have had
no effect whatsoever. It wasn’t
expected to remove all racial and
religious barriers on the campus
and stimulate _a brbtherhood
movement overnight. But it was
intended to pave the way for this
article whichiwill be more spe-
ciﬁc and not quite so delicate.

 

In our society,/we deal with and exist upon
groups. The groups here at Pitt, the powerful
groups, are thefraternities and the sororities and
it is here that the ﬁrst movement towards a real
Religion-in—Life ideal must begin. , ‘

It is these groups which are now segregated that
must grow from within their own organjgation to
encompass the University student as a whole. They
"must be proud of their heritage and they‘ must be
individually strong. But more than ' that, they
must express the dream of brotherhood by inter-

. mingling and including all races,‘ all ‘religions, all

people. We must have groups but we mustn’t have

isolationists. There must be an intermingling and,

a crossing of lines as Dr. Freehof‘ suggested.
To do this, the Religion-in-Life program must

‘have a starting point with/these groups and per-

haps the logical place is with the controversial
“discrimination clauses” in fraternity and sorority
constitutions and by—laws. Although there was con-
siderable publicity and activity to rid the Uni-
versity of these a few years ago, the fact remains

that they are still very much in evidence.

/
They. wereeliminated from the University aca-

demic and admissions polices but the‘ extra-cur-
ricular activities still continue the practice.

On this campus, there are discrimination clauses

-in many of the fraternity and sorority constitutions

and by-laws. In some, there are none at all, in
. o

others ,there are no clauses but there are restric-

tive procedures.

I said I was going to name names but in view \

 

of the fact that this is not an exposure, as such, I
will reserve that right till a later date’ and instead,
use only my ovsfn fraternity‘ asian example. Sigma
Chi wasfounded at Miami University in Oxforc_l,:.

Ohid;-in'1855. Its constitution states that no per,‘-

son shall be eligible ‘for membership ““‘who" is not

a bona; ﬁde white, male student.” There is no ,
mention of religious restriction but a Negro can-C
- not  admitted. - , _
Sigma'Chi is not the only fraternalorganization"

on campus with a discrimination caluse. Not by‘

a long shot. There are others with bothireligious
and racial aspects. But by using my own fraternity,

no one can accuse me of favoritism ‘of indiscrimi-

nate attack. . ,
II also believe that I will not be condemned, but

merely criticized, by  fraternity brothers who .

must realize my position on the matter and respect
my opinion. It will not change my belief in Sigma
Chi. If we are to remove barriers in the Tuck
Shops, in the Commons‘ Room, in the University
generally, we must include everyone.

. Is a man good enough to play football for us

but not sit in the same booth or at the same. table
in the Commons or cafeteria because his skin is
‘darker or lighter or because he does or does not
believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God? Can
we accept” a person on one level as an equal or

better and refuse him friendship because his.par- o

ticulap: group differs in religion or race?

Wecan retainour group individuality, yes, we
must retain it, but we can also unite under a com-
mon bond. IWhether we are "Catholic-~ or Jewish

I or Protestant, Negro or Chinese or Caucasian, Athe-
_ist or Mormon or Amish, we are still citizens; of

one county, people of one community, students of
one school. ’

I am not trying to present a tirade with the
hope of converting or assuming the role of an
evangelist. This is «rather an opinion expressed
after four years of association. and considerable
soul-searching and self appraisal. This may ac-
complish little or it may do some good, but it can-
not be ignored by anyone Who. is connected with
the University and it especially cannot be passed

’ over after the activities of ‘the last three days.

To have a Religion-in-Life conference at Pitt ‘is
to express the belief that it will ultimately be of
value to someone.‘ If we believe ‘in it enough to
emphasize itfor three days we must have-the faith
and courage to attempt to implement it every day
in the year. ' '

By Jolm De Ninno T
\ For the ‘past few years the ma-
jor television networks have been
“working on various plans to ex-

tract money from viewers..These
have been given the general title

-“Pay-As-You-See” television.
According to recent reports,

backing of the ‘
plans is grow-
ing in momen-
tum, and ‘ a
g 0 o d deal of
progress h a s
been made.
. P r a ctically
a ll of th e
plans f o l -
low the same
principle. The
networks will .
ﬁlm 'outstand- I
ing events such as championship
boxing bouts, major
games, operas, symphonies, and
the like. .They also hope to show
specially made motion pictures
that will not be shown. in the
nation’s movie houses.

Programs Scrambled to the nation as a whole, because

The shows will be sent over
the networks in a scrambled
fashion, and to unscramble the
ﬁlms the viewers will be requir-
ed to pay a given amount of
money, depending on the show.
It is in this respect that the plans
differ most. One will use the tele-

phone company as a.col1ector of

the money. The viewers must
call the company and ask to be
tuned in,‘ then be billed with
their regular phone bill. An-
other plan expects the viewers to
deposit the speciﬁed amount in-
to the television set and will send

. out collectors to gather the de- I

posits.
Some Opposition
Although many television ex-

ecutives, promoters, and movie .
‘moguls are backing the plans in

hopes of equitably sharing the
. proﬁts, just as many oppose the
idea. Added to this opposition
the uncertainty of the public’s
reaction is a threat. The plans

they are not perfected. However,
shows have been viewed by se-
lected audiences using one or
another of the plans. These have,
reportedly, been successful.
Opposition to “Pay—As-You-
See”, television could come in
several forms. First, the pub-

‘lic may not be satisﬁed to stay

home for their entertainment all
of the time. Secondly, the num-
ber of industries who stand to
gain from the plans are much
fewer than those who will prob-
ably lose. . Among the latter are

restaurants, transportation, and

advertising ﬁrms. (There will be
no commercials on the “Pay”
type television).

.' A Good Point

Favoring the plans is the fact

_that most families will save by

paying only a small amount to
see events as a group that would
have cost’ a good deal more to see
individually. _The price of a paid

television show will be the same

 Neluis-Service Director
Publicity Pipeline

By NANCY JONES

Pitt’s pipeline for publicity is
a’ soft-spoken fellow with big
ideas named Max Elder, director

‘ of the University, News Service.

The ‘job of the News Service, he
explains, is to be a ‘‘liaison be-

tween the University and its view-

ing, reading, and listening public.”

‘During the year 1952-'53 there
were 512 different University stor-
ies to be publicized. A. total of 6,-
727 copies of these stories were
written and sent by the News
Service to various publications. In
addition 289 pictures were sent
out. ~

The Big Story

One of the recent major stories
which shows the work of Mr. El-
der and the News Service was that
of the $15 million medical school
grant. A 40-page press book was
prepared ahead of time giving all

relative information. These were ‘
"sent out Thursday before the Mon-

day night announcement so that
papers could work on the story and
give it adequate coverage.

Fifty press books and 200 cop-
ies of the story were sent out.
These went to some 20 papers in
the immediate tri-state’-area, 3_4
science and education editors, re-

- search magazines, and many oth-

er publications throughout the
United States. J

“It’s more than local publicity
we’re after, we want national pub-
licity,” explains Mr. Elder. He is
not alone in his time-consuming
job. Mrs. Jane Shaw, assistant di-
rector, works with him in writing
stories and keeping the public in-
formed. The News Service also
consists of a secretary and two
part-time assistants.

“There are a great many things .

going. on around Pitt that many
people aren’t aware of. We have
to keep the over-all picture in
sight,” adds Mr. Elder. His pro-
gram is a three-fold one. It aims
at local, national, and internal
publicity, “It’s just as important
that people here know what’s go-
ing on, too,” he says. -
Telephone Plays Important Part
In publicizing events, Mr. Elder
or Mrs. Shaw meets with the plan-
ning group first, if possible,_ to
work out publicity angles. Ad-
vance stories are usually written
and sent to interested sources.
Telephone calls are an important
part .of Mr. Elder’s work. He esti-
mates that 5,200 calls are made a
year, including inquiries from pa-
pers. 
‘Mr. Elder keeps a file of all stor-
ies sent out, and those printed.
He has on ﬁle the name of every

paper in the U. S. and keeps a»

listgof every magazine’ or paper
where Pitt’s name appeared.
Polio Vaccine Well-Publicized
There were 279 editorials con-
cerning Pitt in U. S. papers dur-
ing 195.2-’53. Work on the polio
vaccine was the subject of 220 of
these. Forty-ﬁve of the editorials
were in local Pittsburgh papers.
The News Service uses the serv-
ices of a commercial clipping
agency in New‘Work which sends

MAX Q. ELDER

Came from U. of Iowa
* * *

them all clippings about Pitt that
appear in non-local U. S. papers.

“We have had very good local
coverage,” Mr. Elder’ says. “I am
very happy with it.” He likes to
give publicity a personal touch by
making friends with reporters and
people with whom he comes in‘
contact. Meanwhile, he is trying to
strengthen ‘Pitt’s national connec-
tions. ’

Yetihe does not forget about the
individual Pitt student and the
small hometown papers. When-
ever a student does something
newsworthy, a" clipping or small
article goes to the student's home-
town paper. .

Each month "he sends out fea-
ture material-to 120 local papers
about some event of 'major im-
portance happening at Pitt. Exam-
ple events are the wild ﬂower
book recently by ‘Dr. 0. E. Jen-
nings and Dr. Andrey Avinoﬁ, and
the new medical building.

New Man Knew Job

It sounds as if Mr. Elder has .

been working at Pitt on this pub-
licity program for a long time, but
actually he came here just last
April. Mr. Elder is a journalism
graduate of the University of
Iowa and he worked for a while
as special writer and editor for
the National Society for Crippled
Children and Adults. Later he

Tech Hosts Panthers
As Season Nears End

By DAVE MAZER
Much as they tried, Coach Bob Tim,mons hoopsters

oouldn’t win three straight games this season.
_So now, with -only two tussles remaining, one tonight
against Carnegie Tech at Skibo Gym, the Panthers will shoot

._\

for the consolation prize-—two in a row.

After this evening’s road

Gold will end their first season‘

under Timmons Saturday night

with Geneva at the Field House.
Tech Way Behind

Mel Crats1ey's boys, who will

.be forever trying to overcome

Pitt’s all-time edge of 73-16, have
won nine of their last ten contests
and own a. season mark of 12-9.

The Panther’s chance to end the
1953-54 year with three consecu-
tive triumphs faded away Mon-
day afternoon at Army when the
Pitts died in the last quarter, 82-
72. ‘ ' "

‘Senior Bernie Artman, who was
switched to forward at mid—sea-
son, led the Panthers in scoring
for the ﬁrst time in his career
with 19 points at West Point.

Panthers Favored

Last year Pitt went over to the
other side of Oakland and won,
66-52, and previously this cam-
paign, they romped easily over
the Tartans, 69-58, at the Field
House.

As usual against Tech, the Pan-
thers will be favored, but as usual,
this doesn’t mean_ anything to
Pitt. Only twice this season have
the Panthers won when the book-
ies said they should, so predic-
tions are useless.»

‘Lining up for the Panthers will
be captain and high scorer Dutch
Burch and soph Joe Fenwick at
the guards, Frank Zimmovan of
Uniontown at center, and Ed Pav-
lick of Johnstown Catholic and
Artman at forwards.

Sowell, sophomore from Schen-

The high-ﬂying Nittany Lions
finally met their downfall last
Saturday at the hands of Navy
after, winning 38 consecutive

meets-—the same Navyteam that
Pitt dumped earlier in the season.

And this Satifrday night the
Lions and the Panthers clash in
the “big , one” at State College.
All the past season’s records likely
will be forgotten, however, when
the Blue-and-Gold grapplers and
Charley Speidel’s NCAA cham-
pions hit the mats.

While Penn State was getting
used to the bitter taste of defeat
last week, the Peerymen obviously
were relishing their meeting with
West Virginia at the Field House,
where they hung the horsecollar
on the Mountaineers, 30-0.

The frosh team also humbled
their West Virginia counterparts,
22-5.

For the varsity, Hugh Peery,
Charley Uram, and George Mat
thews all made their -last home
college meet a memorable one with
easy wins. Uram pinned his man,
as did heavyweight Harold Hun-
ter and George Beresford, 177.

Bob Cook, another dependable
man scored a shutout in the 147

dium range.

Sgt. Bob Davidson’s men took
the measure of the Blufﬁtes in the
ﬁrst match of the season, 1377-
1345. Following that win, the Pitt
sharpshooters posted victories over
Carnegie Tech and W&J.

West Virginia tagged them with
their only loss Feb. 13.

In last Friday’s match, the 10-
cals piled up a fairly wide margin
in making W&J their third vic-
tim, 1385-1345.

with a 288,, followed by Dave

A Big Chance

By RUSS FRANKE

Sports Editor

also handles their baseball team, remarked recently that col-
legiate wrestling supremacy is moving East. With a couple
of breaks thrown in, plus an all-out effort on the part of our
local grapplers, that supremacy could move right‘ up to our

dogrstep. »

‘Oklahoma, the homeland of Rex Peery & Sons, had long
been the seat of mat power until last year, when Penn State
grabbed the NCAA crown- And now, as a result of State’s
loss to Navy, many of the local followers already envision
the Panthers stepping into their sho_es.

Pitt would stand an excellent chance of doing just that
but for a number of bothersome injuries that have weakened
the team somewhat. As it is, however, Peery’s men have

their work cut out for them.

First of“ all, they will ‘have. a to

outﬁt on their hands'at

State College this Saturday-—an out t bent on rebounding at any-
body’s expense. And after that match, which by the way, a number
of Pitt students plan on seeing,‘ comes the Interstate Championships

the following Saturday.

And one week later, Peery will herd his flock back to Oklahoma

for the big chance at national honors--the NCAA’ championships.

We hope that the optimists are right, that the Pitt men will. return
with Penn State’s crown’, for it would climax a phenomenal climb
from the nothingness of live‘ years ago when Peery took over.

Here’s hoping we haven't jinxed them by mentioning the pos-
sibilities, but heaven knows how long it has ‘been since Pitt fans
"have been able to talk about national titles.

will be carrying a 6-4 record while,

Tech will be hunting their sixth

I win as against nine reverses.

Pitt Has Edge '

When comparing the two teams
against their most recent common
opponent, W&J, Pitt appears to
have a deﬁnite edge. While Pitt
trounced W&J, 79-49, the Tartans
were able to bump the Prexies,
48-35. .

Dan Heep, 6-3 forward, has been
the Tartan big gun byaveraging
21 points per game.

In their two meetings last year
the teams split the home-and-
home series with» Tech taking the
ﬁrst game and Pitt copping the
second.

— Won Big One

With Tech having the home
court advantage tonight’s game
could well turn out to’ be quite» a
contest between the heated rivals.

The. Panthers got back on the
winning trail last Saturday night
as they nosed out Westminster’s
Titans, 74-70, at New Wilmington.
Pitt had previously edged West-
minster, 81-79, at the Field House.

After the game Coach Carl Pet-
erson remarked, “This was the big

one. Those boys beat West Vir-

ginia.”
Close Game

Pitt had bowed‘ to WVU twice
this season, so this contest was
to be the big test for the young
Panthers.

At the end of the third quar-
ter, Pitt was leading Westminster
by 13 points, but the Towering
Titans came battling back -in the

last quarter to take a five point
lead.

3911 Forbes ‘St.

The Petersonmen, however, rose

. to the occasion as they roared

back to tie the score atA70-70 with
one minute remaining and then to
move ahead to ice the ‘contest at
74-70.
Lazor, Riser Lead

Big “Stretch” Lazor and John
Riser sparked the Panther of-
fensive as they split 47 points,
while ‘Darrell Lewis turned in his
usual ﬁne defensive game.

Lazor again was the big gun
from the pivot with his hook shot
as he ﬂipped in 24 points while
Riser turned in a, brilliant game

Lehigh, second only to ‘Pitt in the Eastern Collegiate
Swimming Championship last year, furnishes the Panther

mermen their ﬁnal dual meet competition
a chancelfor a winning record.
Pitt copped the ECSA crown lastﬁ

season but the dual meet record
showed three ‘wins, four losses, and
one tie. As for 1953-54, however,
even with the 51-33 defeat by
Army last Saturday, Coach Ben
Grady’s men can still own a 6-4
mark. 1

more Jim Zurcher continued his

Another bright spgt in the con-
test was the performance of little
Mary Kaufman. L

New Starter

Kaufman, a 5-8 guard, was the
latest addition to the fresh regu-
lars and had been seeing only lim-
ited action.

With starter John Laneve out

with a leg injury Coach Peterson _

startedsDave Wunderlich at Lan-
eve’s guard position. It just wasn’t
Wunderlich’s night so Peterson
‘sent Kaufman in at the guard post.

Marv came through as he turn-
ed in an excellent ﬂoor and de-

fensive game while chipping in

with eight points. . _ V

On the basis of his perfomance
at New Wilmington, Kaufman will
probably start in tonight’s game.

THE Loelc MAJOR
WHO HATED’

 

Recently a young mid-westerner enrolled at a
university as 21 Logic major. His father had told him,

with some understatement, that he was illogical. He refused

to squire a pretty girl to a dance because her name was
June Betz and he was against gambling.

He wouldn’t eat avocados because they were also called
“alligator pears” and he didn't like alligators.

In addition, he was a slob.

Some of the men in his dorm tried to talk to him.

“Look at that shirt,” they said. “The material's cheesy.
Why don't you hop down and get a Van Heusen
Oxfordian . . . it's soft, ﬁne oxford cloth.”

“I’m not attending Oxford. I'm attending Old Siwash,"

answered our boy.

“But, look, Buster. This oxford cloth is woven tighter ,
so it’ll last longer. It's a smart investment.

And it only costs $4.50.”

“So who needs it? I might get hit by a truck. Then what
good would it be?” quoth Buster. '

“What about your collar? Flat as a pancake! Don't you
want. a good-looking button-down with that famous
Van Heusen relg_xed—roll?” one asked.

_“I got nothing against pancakes. I hate rolls.”

‘ Note: Our man flunked Logic post haste, and was drafted. ,
The Army has him classiﬁed under “Secret Weapons.”
