O'Connor eliminales l1ecIIII1 plan

By Mark Gordon
Asst. News Editor

Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor has decided to elim-
inate the option of
HealthAmerica as an insurance
carrier for Pitt faculty and
staff, despite a unanimous vote
by Faulty Assembly to keep
the service.

The chancellor explained his
decision in a letter obtained by
The Pitt News, written by
O’Connor to “faculty and staff
colleagues.” In this letter,
O’Connor wrote, “This course
of action will produce signiﬁ-
cant benefits for the university,
including a savings of at. least
$5 million over the next three
years.”

Faculty Assembly President
James Holland said he was
very angry, along with being
“surprised and shocked” at
O’Connor’s decision.

“I have never in my life seen
such a blatant disregard for
faculty and staff at this univer-
sity,” Holland said. 

Herbert Chesler, the chair of
the Senate Committee on
Benefits and Welfare, said at a
recent Faculty Assembly meet-
ing that despite the uni-
versity’s overall savings, indi-
vidual savings would only
amount to about $150 over
three years.

O’Connor wrote in the letter
that he realizes ‘fthat this deci-
sion bears consequences for

some,” but added that making.

" University of Pittsburgh

a smooth transition to Blue
Cross full-time will be a prior-
1ty.

O’Connor was in Harrisburg
‘yesterday and could not be
reached for comment on the
letter, ’ but Director of
Communications Ken Service
said, “The chancellor is very
aware for the need for continu-
ity of [health] care.” 8

In addition to the savings for
the university, O’Connor
wrote, “By endorsing Blue
Cross, we are supporting the
University of Pi.ttsburgh
Medical Center.”

While Holland agreed that
the university is supporting
UPMC, he called for leader-

ship outside of the medical-

field.

Learn how to box for good 
health, self-defense and credits

By Allison Stallone
Staff Writer

So you think boxing is
only for the Mike Tysonsand

the George Forernans of the '

world? Well, not anymore.

Fitness boxing is the latest
rage in aerobic workouts,
and you won’t have to sacri-
fice your face since there is
no actual fighting involved.
It is being offered as an exer-
cise course in the fall, and
there is still time to register
or Add/Drop.

“[Fitness boxing] keeps
your body in shape and is a
different ‘angle of working
out,” said Curtis Smith,

teacher of the course.

The course will teach stu-
dents how to master boxing’s
basic punches like the hook,
jab and uppercut and the
footwork of boxing, accord-
ing to Smith, and it will also
improve students’ strength,
stamina, coordination, reﬂex
and speed. '

The class workouts include
circuit training (push-ups,
medicine ball, jump rope,
etc.), shadow boxing and bag
work. In each class, the stu-
dents will bring their heart

"rate to the maximum safe
working rate for at least-20 .

minutes, according to Smith.
The course also offers stu-

./

dents the reality of a gym

from the hand wrapping right
down to the Rocky music.
Fitness boxing started in
New York a few years ago. It
was called “executive box-
ing” because a lot of execu-
tives in New York who had
become tired of the regular

workouts started going to

gyms and doing the same

_ training that boxers did.

The results were a better
conditioned body, according
to Smith, because “prize
fighters are the best condi-
tioned athletes we have.” But
another side to this class is
the aspect of learning self-

‘Boxing, page 3

“It is obvious that UPMC is
calling the shots,” Holland
said. “What we need is some
leadership in the chancellor’s
office.”

Along with the Faculty
Assembly unanimous vote,
Holland said a “preliminary
survey, with a very large
turnout, indicated 76 percent
[of faculty and staff] did not
want single coverage.”

O’Connor stated in the letter
that Hea1thAmerica will be
eliminated as of July I, 1995.

Holland said there is not
much the Faculty Assembly
can do now that O’Connor has
made his decision.

“We may express some con-
troversy, but the final decision
is his,” Holland said.

5 GB will
draft

meal plan

  proposal

By Nathan Hughes
Staff Writer . -

The Student Government
Board is planning to draft a
proposal regarding the cur-
rent meal plan system.

This proposal will detail

the SGB’s stand on the cur-
rent BLOCK Meal Plan sys-
tem and whether or not it
has proven to be successful.
The Department of Food

Services will receive a “copy '

of the proposal so it is made
aware of students’ opinions

regarding the BLOCK sys-

tem.
“Keith Campbell and I are

going to be drafting another -

letter to Food Services, and
it will be goingto the appro-
priate areas to redefine
SGB’s stance on the food
services for next year,” said
SGB President . Julie
Crowell.

SGB said it feels the cur-
rent BLOCK system is
doihg a satisfactoryjob of
providing students with an
adequate meal plan "system,
and that it should remain in
effect next fall.

“I think that many of the
students were basically con-
fused about the BLOCK sys-
tem. They didn’t realize

what they had and are very,

scared about the possibility
of it leaving,” said Crowell.
SGB member John

V Callahan phrased it in a dif-

ferent manner. _

defense.

“A lot of people need to
know something about self-
defense,” said Smith. “In
this class you.really learn
how to use your fists.”

This aspect has brought
the class to theiattention of
women.

“It would give you some-
thing to use for self-defense,
and it would be more inter-
esting and challenging than
a regular aerobic workout,”
said student Mindy Barr.

Smith said there are other
aspects of the class that
women love.

“We are biologically struc-
tured so that some of us are
quicker in the lower or

upper body,” Smith said._

“Women get to work with
the upper body and have
expressed liking the bag
work to improve their upper
body strength.”

At the end of the class,
Smith puts on a “red man”
suit, which is a $1,000 suit
that is completely padded
from head to toelike the
ones used in self-defense
classes. Everyone gets to
fight a few rounds with him
in the suit.

“They get to attack.
Women go crazy over it,”
Smith said.

Smith also uses the suit in
his own self-defense class
that he teaches_at Pitt called
BYAM (Buy Yourself A
Minute). It is also the title of
his book, “The BYAM
Method of Self—Defense.”

Smith has a long history
with full-contact sports. He

won over 136 wrestling
matches in high school in
New York, and then he went
to Pitt on a football scholar-
ship and played under Coach
Johnny Majors in the. ‘70s.

Since graduating from Pitt
in 1976 with a degree in
social sciences, he has won
over 400 trophies in martial
arts, as well as having been
inducted into the World’s
Martial Arts Hall of Fame
Association and honoredas
the overall 1992 Black Belt
State Champion in
Pennsylvania.

He owns his own compa-
ny, Universal Professional
Training, which operates
martial art organizations at
the University of Pittsburgh

and Carnegie-Mellon
University.
Besides belonging to

. . I
numerous police and martial;

arts organizations, he is a.
state—certified police officerl
and self-defense instructor,
and he teaches courses in
how and when to use mace
and the effects of it. He is
also a police officer at the:
Department of Public Safety
at Pitt. ’

As registration for fall
classes is getting started,
women students particularly
seem to be excited about this
new class.

“It would be different, fun,
and it would be exercise,”
said student Heather Fisher.

Fitness boxing is being
offered in the fall as a one-
credit exercise class.

Smith’s self-defense class
is also being offered in the

This proposed program is

details are still being final-

Pitt is not all UPMC

Autocracy reigns supreme at this university. Over the opinion
of 76 percent of the University of Pittsburgh faculty and staff
surveyed said they would like to keep the HealthAmerica option
as a choice for their benefits package. The members of the
Faculty Assembly at the March 15 meeting also voted to keep
HealthAmerica. Chancellor O’Connor, in a rare show of deci-'
siveness, has decided to discontinue the HealthAmerica plan,
moving all university employees to the Blue Cross plan, which
is connected with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
Blue Cross allows its subscribers to use UPMC. ‘

Despite the wishes of the other members of the University of
Pittsburgh, the chancellor is looking to make Pitt a company
town, so to speak. It appears that the deciding factor is not the
overwhelming savings for the university, but rather the goal is to
support the medical center over the rest of the university.

The Chancellor should look to supporting the university as a
whole. The University of Pittsburgh is not just the medical cen-
ter. The Chancellor should exercise executive authority over the
entire university as a show of support. Divisiveness and inter-
departmental politics are sure to be worsened, which is some-
thing the university does not need added to its problems. The
Senate Council and Faculty Assembly have a role to play and

, should not be ignored in the administration of this university.

Miracles mixed blessings

New breakthroughs in medical technology are occurring
every day, and they often are useful to us in a number ways.
These medical advances are in large part responsible for the
increasing life spans of the people in the world. Yet, some of
these modern medical miracles lead to difficult ethical ques-
tions.

A report in The New York Times describes how there are now

a number of tests which will allow people to be tested for -

genetic predisposition to a variety of cancers. Among the dis-
eases which can now be tested for are breast cancer, brain can-
cerand melanoma. The tests look for mutated genes which
may increase an individual’s risk for cancers.

OncorMed, Inc. has signed an agreement with the Preferred
Oncology Network in Atlanta togbegin offering these tests. If
the testing reveals those who have a genetic predisposition
towards certain types of cancer, then they may help save lives.
People can alter their lifestyles and do things which will maxi-
mize their chances of avoiding or surviving cancer.

The problem is deciding who gets access to the results of the
tests. If doctors and health care professionals use this informa-
tion to determine the best methods for helping patients main-
tain their health, then these tests will be useful. But if insur-
ance companies and employers use this information to deter-
mine whom they cover or hire, then these tests will become
another Orwellian method of monitoring society.

The ’Righf’ way to run a government

ot many people realize
that Newt Gingrich
was named after Isaac

Newton. This fact (or good
guess) is ironic since Newton
was the first to explain the the-
ory of gravity, whereas
Gingrich is dispelling the laws
of gravity by watching his star
rise, escaping the bonds of
America, Earth and reality.

Since the mid-term elec-
tions, Gingrich has appeared
on television almost as often
as O.J. Simpson. He’s attacked
the White House with a higher
frequency than those crazed
gunmen that have used the
White House as though it were
a registered NRA target.
(Actually, one of those guys
wasn’t caught ...)

Despite his fiery rhetoric,
Rush Limbaugh wit and Phil
Donahue hair, this politician is
now Speaker of the House.
While this and a quarter used
to get a weak cup of coffee
from a greasy coffee shop, it
now holds prestige. Let’s face

‘ it: Newt Gingrich, Speaker of

the House, holds a bit of clout.

And thank goodness for
that! -

Under the leadership of ‘Bill
and Hillary Clinton, the United
States has become a cesspool
of caring. We must face facts,
something the Democrats in
Congress have been unable to
do for the past 40 years. We
don’t have money to care. We
care about the tired, the poor
and the huddled Haitians
yearning to breathe free. We
care more than any country in
North America, aside from
Canada.

We’re also the only country
that allows its social policy to
be guided by a statue that sits
in the harbor of a city where
these same social programs
have done nothing to stem the
tide of filth, corruption and
crime that litters its streets.
When are we to stop assisting
others and start assisting those
that make this country tick like
an efficient German army?
When are we going to start
caring about our own wallets,

families and middle- to upper-
class Christians? This is the
American majority. Of course
Jews and non-radical blacks
should also be included under
this canopy of assistance. This
is, the message of Newt
Gingrich, a message which has
somehow been twisted and
distorted by radical gays,
pagans, the liberal media and
Communists within our soci-

ety.
Yes, Newt Gingrich is gruff.
He’s blunt." But, Newt

Gingrich is a tough, honest
politician who needs to be
blunt and honest to get his
ideas past the‘ liberal media
and into the homes of
Americans who agree with
him, whether they realize it or
not. He’s a man on a mission.
A man with a contract on
America; I mean a contract for

America. He doesn’t need to‘

be glamorous, or a politician
with a gimmick.-He just needs
to be Newt.

Newt’s Contract with
America is the perfect remedy
for a country overrun with car-

.ing, compassion and sin.

Caring, compassion and sin in
fact are buzzwords on the lib-
eral agenda. All the money the
liberals have spent on helping
the poor, killing babies,
strengthening the ozone layer,
funding public television and
protecting endangered animals
has stripped funds that could
have been used on defense and
an upper-class tax out. And
what’s more important than
national security and money in
the hands of. the wealthy? Is
the world safe? A drunk is in
charge of Russia’s nuclear
arsenal. Yugoslavia has been at
war for three years. North
Korea still yearns to swallow
the South. Clearly, our defense
should be strengthened, not
weakened. And who pays for
the weaponry that will rid the
world of dictatorship? The
rich.

Now, how are they supposed
to fund our defense if they
have to pay more taxes? What
do the poor do to benefit soci-

ety?.They suck the welfare
system dry, stain our reputa-
tion by insisting to live in the

streets and gobble our taxes by ,

relying on food stamps and the
school lunch program for food.
As far as Newt is concerned,
these “poor” people shouldn’t
even be allowed to vote.

Newt knows what will make
America strong well into the
nextmillennium. He knows
sloth and immorality will not
guide America forward. He
knows the United Nations will
not fight our battles or dictate
our foreign policy. Newt’s
Contract on America is like
the .10 commandments, which,
if followed, will strengthen
American society. From his
office in what would be proud-
ly termed the, “Wilhelmstrasse
on the Potomac,” Newt will
oversee the construction of
this new society.

Newt’s society will be moral
and just — a society that will
fear God almost as much as it
will fear him. The greatest
benefactors of Newt’s vision
will be the generation brought
upin orphanages without par-

ents, public television, lunches
or government assistance to '

misdirect them. These children
will be self-reliant.‘They’ll
worship the Republican Party
which swiped them away from
the claws of death held not by
God, but by doctors and uncar-
ing parents. Newt will hereby
win the love and respect of a
generation of minority brown-
shirts wholly independent of
government aid, loyal and sub-
-'servient to both the
Republicans and the American
flag.

To assure the future survival
of our beloved country, the
youth must be brainwashed,
bushwhacked and reeducated.
Newt’s policies ensure
America’s dominance well
into the next century. This is
the right way to govern. This
is the right’s way of govern-
ing. Heil Newt!

nist for The Pitt News.

Luckiest  

team could
tincl gold in
its path

ing its mad-
dening close. Final Four
time. '

Those of you office pool
maniacs with teams still in
the mix are probably running
out of dorm space with
which to house your ego.
Since I had Maryland rolling
over Kentucky on April 3,

-this weekend’s lunacy did

not create a multitude of
overexcitement for me. A

Therefore, despite the fact
that none of my teams made
the Final Four (I know I’m
not the only one who liked
Villanova and Virginia), I
amgoing to force-feed my ,

infinite wisdom upon you.
Take it in with a grain of
salt. '-

Now, a lot of talk during
this week will deal with I
enough statistics to choke
Bryant Reeves, but there are
just three which you need to
concern yourselves with.

Momentum.

Hmm  a tough one. A
case could be made for
North Carolina, since they
have had seemingly the least
amount of trouble in making
it to the Final Four.
However, the Tarheels have
had the fortune to be on the
opposite end of the floor
from good teams having
subpar days.

Therefore, UCLA edges
out North Carolina in this
category. After Tyus Edney’s
stake through the heart of
Missouri, the Bruins have
been the tournament’s most
consistent team, and they
could finally pull Jim
Hariick out of the Wizard’s
shadow.

Crowd Favorite.
Oklahoma State’s behe-
moth Big Country blows out

the competition in this all-
important category. Bryant
Reeves has, without a doubt,
the most interesting back-
ground of any player in the
big dance.

The gargantuan seven-
footer from a town smaller
than a psych lecture has
made some serious strides .
since arriving in
Cowboyland. When he got
to Oklahoma State, much of
his humongous frame resem-
bled 300 pounds of tapioca ~

years of rigorous on— and
off-court training, Big
Country is now one of col-
lege basketball’s most domi-

The Pitt Panther baseball team suffered
through a dismal 1-4 road trip this week-
end that included a three-game sweep by
the Villanova Wildcats to open up the Big
East season.

“It was sickening, it was embarrassing,
we stunk,” said infielder Jon DeBemardis.
“Coach Jackson said we didn’t do any-
thing right, and we didn’t.”

The first game of Saturday’s double-
header against the Wildcats started out
promisingly.

Pitt jumped out to a‘ 3-0 lead in the first
inning highlighted by a Jason Conti double
that scored Kurt Womelsdorf. _

“We were going into these games with a
lot of confidence,” said infielder Ed
Shaffer. “We had played well up to that
point.”

The good playing ceased after the top of
the first. - -

Starting pitcher Mike Rohrbach, whose
record dropped to 2-2, surrendered five
runs in the bottom of the first, and the
Wildcats didn’t look back- for the rest of
the weekend.

“It was my first Big East start,”
Rohrbach said, “but it seemed like the
whole team had never played a Big East
game before.”

Villanova continued to rough up
Rohrbach. He gave up 12 runs, seven
earned, while walking three in two innings
pitched.

“They can really hit‘ the ball,” Rohrbach
said. “I was impressed with their program,
and I think they could be a top contender

The saga continued as Kevin Kramer

By the end of the fifth inning, Pitt trailed

Kramer yielded eight runs, seven earned, 20-3, which would be the final score.

Women's lacrosse

headed for playoffs

By Matt Townsend
For The Pitt News

Last weekend the Pitt
women’s lacrosse team
played in a round-robin tour-
nament at Michigan State
University. By going 2-1, the
ladies claimed first place and
left with a 5-1 overall record
and a 4-1 record in league
play.

In the opening game, Notre
Dame wasn’t a test, as eight
different players scored en
route to a 10-1 thrashing.
Defensive standouts
Samantha Garrit and Astrid
Rapp blocked several penalty
shots, and goalie Jessica
Strelitz was solid in giving up
only one goal.

. “We were leading the whole
We almost had a
shutout, but they scored in
the" closing minutes,” ‘said
Rapp‘. “We had awesome
teamwork against Notre

Dame. Everyone was working
together.”

Host Michigan State was
the Panthers’ next victim, los-
ing 9-5. Center Heather
Dowdy dominated the face-
off, constantly gaining pos-
session, which started fast
brelaks. Jodi Marcus led all
scorers with three-goals, and
Dowdy and Bowman each
added two.

“Heather played great —
she was a_bi_g factor in our
win,” Rapp said.

Playing with only two’ subs
and a 15-minute break
between games caused
fatigue during the final game
against Michigan. ’

“At the half we were win-
ning 2-1, but in the second we
were tired and it showed.
They dominated play in the
second half,” Rapp said. “We
had chances, but our shots
were going right to the goalie.

In a contest that was a lot
closer than the final score
indicated, the Pitt men’s
.lacrosse team defeated divi-
sion rival Grove City
Thursday at the Cost Center,
16-10.

The game also marked the
first start for freshman goal-
keeper John McGrath.

“Initially, I was extremely
nervous about starting,” said
McGrath. “In the beginning
of the game, I made a lot of
mental mistakes. After a
while, I got comfortable
again and settled in ‘a little
bit." '

“The game went pretty
well considering we were
short—handed,” said head
coach’ Gary Neff. “Our
offense played extremely
well, and a lot of different
players scored goals.”

In their last four contests,
the Panthers are 2-2, and the
overall aura of the team is
positive.

“We are playing well with.

the‘ resources that we have,”
said junior David Rapone. “It
seems like we are starting to
do the fundamental things
better such as throwing and

catching the ball. We have a A
‘lot of young players on the

team. A lot of first-year play-
ers. This is definitely a
rebuilding year for us. Next
year, we will have the foun-
dation down for a good team.
Last year’s team was simply
a powerhouse.”

For a team that is severely
undermanned, the Panthers
are still in a good position to
do some damage this season.
On Tuesday, the team has a
showdown with Davis and
Elkens at the Cost Center.

Altogether, the Villanova hit-
ters collected 20 runs on 15
hits, while sending six Panther
pitches outside the ballpark.
Third baseman John Cassesa
led the way for Villanova with
two home runs, three hits and

_ six RBI.

The Panthers managed three
runs on seven hits while com-
mitting three errors.

Game two of the double-
header saw the Panthers jump
out to a 6-0 lead, but Pitt lost
12-9.

“We almost won every
game,” DeBernardis said.
“We’d get the lead, then every-

thing would go wrong.” a
With Pitt leading by six

going into the bottom of the
fifth, the tables turned on the
Panthers. '

Starting pitcher Tedde

_ Campbell, who suffered his

first loss of the season — drop-
ping his record to 6-1, gave up
eight earned runs over the next
1 1/3 innings. By the end of
six, Pitt trailed Villanova 9-6.

Offensively, DeBemardis led
the way with two hits, two runs
scored, two home runs and four
RBI. Third baseman Tyler
Shantz hit his second homer of
the year and also drove in two
runs.

The Panthers dropped the
Sunday game 13-1 to lower
their season record to 16-6, 0-3
in conference play.

Villanova jumped on starting
pitcher Gregg Mrochko, who
suffered his first loss of the
season, for six runs in the bot-
tom of the second. Chris Bean
surrendered two earned runs in
2 2/3 innings, and Matt
Skokowski gave up three runs
in four innings.

“We try to do things pitch by
pitch. We didn’t go pitch by
pitch this weekend,”
Skokowski said.

Pitt’s lone run came in the
top of the ninth inning when
catcher Jeff Montgomery hit
his first homer of the year. _

“We got outhit this weekend,
that’s the bottom line,” said
Shaffer.

“We do have a good team,”
said DeBemardis, who is bat-
ting .333 with two home runs
and a team-leading 20 RBI.
“We need to get some guts and
just go out and play.

“A lot of these guys like
Conti, Rob Garvey and
Womelsdorf didn’t get to play
much in the Big East last sea-

mostly be played by the younger players,” said Neff. “It will
be good experience for them to play more.”

After the Davis and Elkens game, the team will prepare for
its own version of March Madness. The tournament will start
next weekend and will be hosted dually at the Cost Center

and at Carnegie-Mellon.

“This tournament will tell the story of our 1995 team,”
said Neff. “This is a very tough tournament, and this year it
seems that it will be tougher than ever.” '

Country is the hilarious
group of stories surrounding
his assimilation intothe
everyday life of a Division I
program. Before his sopho-
more season, Sports
Illustrated ran a story about
Reeve’s difficult first year on
campus. It included an
excerpt about OSU’s trip to
the preseason NIT, which
included Big Country’s first
time on an airplane.

During the trip, a team-
mate who was seated next to
Reeves gave him some
chewing gum to help when-
ever his ears began to pop.
Ten minutes later, Reeves
woke his friend up, asking
him for another piece of
gum. When his befuddled
teammate asked why, Reeves
told him that he needed one
for his other ear.

Luck.

The most critic_al element
of them all. Luck-is what
makes the no-names into
heroes and can give a good
team that extra push neces-

‘ sary to win it all.

A great team can win it all,

A and a great team with luck

on its side can prove to be
unbeatable.
V Does this sound a lot like

Arkansas to you?

The Razorbacks have
shouldered the burden of the
national championship all
year and have dealt with all
the criticism that comes with
It.

With its entire starting five
back from last year’s cham-
pionship team, Arkansas was
a good bet to win it all when
the field of 64 was
announced.

Then came the near—fatal
opening round game against
Texas Southern, which ended
with the Razorbacks clinging
to a one—point lead, thus
escaping embarrassment.

How about the second
round loonfest against
Syracuse? After being
blessed by Lawrence
Moten’s timeout, the Hogs
still sweated out a last-sec-
ond Syracuse three-pointer
that fell off the rim to give
Arkansas its second straight
heart-pounding victory.

Now it appears as if the
real Hogs have shown up to
play. A team as good as that
doesn’t need luck when they
are-on their game, but man
does it come in handy.
