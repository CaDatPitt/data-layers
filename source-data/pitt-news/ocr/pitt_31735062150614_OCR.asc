CAA Course

Requires Six
For a Quota

Aeronautics Section
Has Six Vacancies

Six men are needed immedi-
ately for enrollment in the Uni-
versity’s ground and ﬂight
training course under the Civil
Aeronautics authority, Henry C.
Pavian, associate professor of
aeronautical engineering and direc-
tor of the CAA courses, declared
today. ‘

Unless the vacancies are ﬁlled
quickly, emphasized Mr. Pavian, the
University’s quota for the second
semester basic CAA course will be
reduced from 30 to 20 students. A
government ‘ruling requires that
ﬂight instruction be given to stu-
dents in blocks of ten. Men inter-
ested should appear on either Tues-
day or Thursday evening from 6:30
until 9:30 o’clock in 103 State hall.

Most of the first group of 30 stu-
dents who took the basic course
during the first semester have re-
ceived their private :pilot’s certiﬁ-
cates of competency. Others are
in the process of completing the
course.

To enroll for the basic course, of-
fered again for the second semes-
ter, students must have completed
a minimum of 30 credits; must have
passed their nineteenth birthday,
but must not have reached their
twenty-sixth birthday; and must
take a physical examination.

The cost of the course is $25,
which includes tuition, medical fees,
and insurance. Pavian pointed out
the student is getting a possible
$500 worth of ﬂying instruction un-
der the CAA course. He stated al-
so the student is under no obliga-
tion after completion of the course.

The CAA training includes 35
hours in the air during the semester,
and ground training two evenings a
week. Ground training is given in
103 State hall from 6:30 to 9:30 on
Tuesdays and Thursdays, and ﬂy-
ing instruction is given at Bettis
airport.

‘I‘ =-'¢ =1:

‘Pitt’ Receives

Merit A word

Pitt, the official magazine which
interprets the University to faculty
and students, was awarded a certiﬁ-
cate of merit by the American In-
stitute of Graphic
York city this week.

Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett, assistant
professor of English and editor of
Pitt, says that this recognition came
as a complete surprise since she
was unaware that the magazine
was entered in the contest.

Last September Pitt won the prize
in P.itt‘si3u1fgh for outstanding work
in publications which was held in
connection with the celebration of
the five hundredth anniversary of
printing. The judges then submit-
ted the magazine to the annual ex-
hibition of commercial printing in
1‘<.‘e\v York city.

Evidence of the outstanding pro-
gress of Pitt is the fact that it had
been in existence only one year
'\\.'li«nu it received its ﬁrst award. Be-
ing a quarterly, only four issues had
been circulated at that time.‘ "

“Honors for Pitt must be credited
to the writers, the photographers,
and the many other persons who
assist in its publication,” Mrs. Star-
rett declares.

Arts in New

Judge A. M. Tliompson
former dean of the School of Law
and at present professor of con-
stitutional law, has donated part
of his personal library as a gift to
the School of Law library, an-
nounces Stanley L. West, librarian.
The gift includes over 300 volu-
umes of treaties, digests, reports,
and legal periodicals, containing the
Federal Statutes and the reports of
the United States Supreme court.

Scholars’ Day

Honoraries Present
13 Individual Awards

Scholars’ day will be a strict-
ly University affair in both the
place of the ceremony and the
participants in the program.

No off-campus speaker will
appear on the program which
will be conducted in the Stephen
Foster memorial next Wednesday,
marking the ﬁrst time such a
campus-centered observance of
Scholars day has been planned.

Presentation of awards and an-
nouncement of tappees to the hon-
orary scholastic fraternities will be
done entirely by officers of the or-
ganizations, faculty members, and
alumni.

Two New Awards

Two new awards will be
among the 13 which will be present-
ed on Wednesday, Freda Jaﬁe, C41,

chairman of the Scholars’ day com-
mittee, announces.

Pi Tau Phi will present $10 to the
senior in the College with. the high-
est scholastic average. Formerly
the award was given to the senior
in the College who showed the
greatest academic improvement.

Delta. Phi Epsilon, national social
fraternity for women, will give $50
to a Jewish non-fraternity woman
for academic achievement, an award
not presented for several years.
Schoiars’ Tag Day

All students who receive an
award or who are tapped during
the ceremony will wear a tag during
the Commons room tea, planned
after the program. The Scholastic
honors committee of the W SGA will
distribute the tags, according to
Dorothy Weiner, C4-3, chairman of
the committee.

During the tea, a scroll will be
displayed in the Commons room
with the names of the women who
have at least a 2:5 average. The
scroll will be the ﬁrst to be dis-
played since 1938.

All students tappe dor receiving
awards from any of the 14 honor-
ary fraternities, will have their
names inscribed in the giant Book
of Scholars, which contains the
names of all those honored on Schol-
ars’ day since 1932.

Every person whose name is call-
ed on Scholars’ day must have a 2.
average in all subjects, not only
from courses in the particular ﬁeld
in which his work is recognized.

Scliolars to Be Honored for Merit

Shown in Many Fields of Study

[A new feature of Scholars’ day will be the tags to be distributed,
showing each person honored at the assembly. The Pitt News has com-
pillecl a list of several of the honors for which these tags will be wo'rn.]

All of the honorary fraternities
which will tap on Scholars’ day
have set up strict entrance require-
ments. The 12 different awards
which are made at this assembly
are also made only after the can-
quirements.

Pi Tau Phi is an honorary schol-
astic fraternity for both men and
women in the College. The con-
stitution states that members must
be seniors with a 2.2 average or
over. But as only a certain per-
centage of the candidates can be
tapped, the members usually have
a much higher average than 2.2.

Phi Eta Sigma is a fraternity
which taps freshmen men with a
quality point average of 2.5.

Mortar board makes an honor roll
of the names of freshmen women
with a quality point average of
2.75 or over. If any freshman wo-
man has made a quality point av-
erage of 3.0, Mortor board awards
her a key.

Panhellenic council makes an
award to all women seniors who are
members of a sorority, and have an
average of 2.75 for all four years.

Theta Phi Alpha makes the Mar-
garet Enright Memorial award to a
sophomore woman who has been
outstanding in scholarship and ac-
tivities. The awardee does not have
to be a sorority member.

Chi Rho Nu is an honorary pre-
medical fraternity for men. They
recently raised their entrance re-
quirements to 2.2.

The Phi Sigma medal is given to
an outstanding senior science major
with high scholastic standing dur-
ing his four years. The people who
have won this medal in the past
have usually been biology majors.

Each year Dr. Alexander Silver-
man, head of the department of
chemistry gives a membership to
the American Chemical society to
the junior chemistry special who
has had the highest average for
three years.

The Phillips medal is awarded to
the senior chemistry special with
the highest average for four years.

Quax is a fraternity for women
who are science majors. The wo-
men must have a quality point av-
erage of 2. or more. Women may
be tapped from their sophomore
year on.

Chemists to Describe
Uses of Dyes, Stains

“Dyes and Stains——Therapeutic
and Diagnostics,” is the subject
which will be discussed by Dr.
David Levin, assistant professor of
chemistry, and Dr. John Wurdack,
professor of chemistry and physics,
both of the School of Pharmacy, at
a meeting Tuesday evening, March
11, at the large auditorium of the
Falk Clinic.

Students and faculty members
are invited to attend this meeting
which is being sponsored by the
alumni of the School of Pharmacy.

Dr. J. Stanley Gray . . .

assistant professor of psychology

chology in Time of Crisis,” at the
psychology forum on Monday at
4:30 o’clock in 2117 Cathedral. Fac-
ulty and students are invited to par-
ticipate in the forum, announces Dr.
George Ellis Jones, chairman.

Test Tube Government
A Timely Experiment

PLANS ARE WELL under way for the eight
annual meeting of the Intercollegiate Conference
on Government, to be held in Harrisburg late in
April.

It is with a provincial sense of pride that we
point to the fact that the first conference. in
1933. was organized by two Pitt students. Gene-
vieve Blatt and John P. Bracken.

Theirs is the original idea of a sounding-off
board for those who are students of the devices
of government.

We have learned to master our environment.
We build bridges, concoct explosives. devise
energy—ﬁ led food capsules. We have a working
knowledge of how to control the things about us.

We have yet to ﬁnd how to control ourselves.
We devote too little time to the study of the
science of government, the technique whereby
representative men deﬁne the behavior-stand-
ards of the mass of man.

This year the conference operates on the basis
of a model state legislature.

The term needs clariﬁcation.

It is not a model of a state legislature.

It is a model in the sense that it is a pattern
to be followed, an outline by the observation of
which others may proﬁt.

In these times of global thought, we believe
it wise to turn our eyes inwards upon ourselves.
There is a war, granted; we are but too pain-
fully aware of that.

We suspect, though, that we are in the posi-
tion of the man who stands night-and-day vigi-
lance at his door with a shotgun, waiting for
burglars to come, while within the house dust
collects, the plumbing rusts, and the water runs
over in the bathtub.

The problems which ICG considers this year
are as vital, as pertinent as any undertaken by
any state legislature. The only difference is
that there will be no ofﬁcial execution of the
legislation passed upon.

ICG is not a speech class; nor is it a laboratory
for the exercise of Robert’s Rules of Order. It is,
rather, an open forum for the weighing of na-
tional issues.

We llate To Bring
This Up, But . . .

Our department of inappropriate comment
comes up with another incidental reminder.

Do you remember what happened when you
got your last blue print? You looked at it. You
scowled. You said, Enough of this horseplay;

next semester I am going to crack the books. .

I am going to be one day ahead of my assign-
ments.
Well, have you?

A Contest: Who

Is “Wnaekier?

We see by the Lehigh Brown and White
that the Pitt News is the whackiest college news-
-paper in the country.

In the same issue of the B&W, we ﬁnd a sober,

level-headed commentary upon the quote ha-ha
which dribbles in the breeze and goes around
to the back unquote, we hope.

We don’t know whether to take this as an
insult or not. Is it just that we can’t see those
little pink and pouce elephants which the Brown
and White makes out so clearly?

ﬁnal ‘7/ze Ewfz‘

I By DR. FRANCIS J. BROWN
Distributed by INTERCOLLEGIATI-I WASHINGTON PRESS

(EDITOR’S NOTE: Dr. Brown is executive secre-
tory of the Subcommittee on Military Affairs of the Na-
tional Committee on. Education and Defense, as well as

      

secretary of the Subcommittee on Education of the
Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Rec-
'reatio'n.)

Today there is a solemn undertone on every college
and university campus. At the recent conference of
college administrators there was frequent mention, not
of “jitter‘ougs,” but of campus “jitters.” There is still
laughter and “swing”—as there should be—but even
casual conversation after class, in the students’ build-
ing, and around the fraternity dinner table is often in-
terspersed with questions—questions that are recur-
rently uppermost in the mind of every student:

How were you classiﬁed?

Do you think I ought to volunteer?

Will the Army use my special training?

When will those who weren’t 21 last October come

into the draft?

Should I come back to school at all next fall?
What can women do toward national defense?

Students to be Reclassiﬁed

Everyone who registered last October will eventu.-
ally be classiﬁed by his local draft board. Although
men will be called in the order in which their numbers
were drawn, the time at which a particular number
will be called will vary with the local board. A man
who has number 832 may have already been “called”
in one area, and in another, may not receive his no-
tice to report for several weeks or months. This is
inevitable. The quota of draftees is prorated statis-
tically for each area. However, there are two varia-
bles which determine the time when registrant 832
will be called: the number of men preceding him who
are deferred, and the number who volunteer, since each
board is given “credit” for every volunteer registered.

There are four major classiﬁcations: Class IV, de-
ferred because of mental or physical condition; Class
III, deferred because of dependent; Class Ii, deferred
because of occupational status: and Class I, eligible
for service. In the last are the student classiﬁcations:
I-D eligible for unrestricted service. and I-E. restricted
service, at the end of the current academic year.

In the case of students, many draft boards have not
followed this policy. Since it is mandatorv. if the
student requests it, to place him in Class I-D or I-E,
the boards have frequently granted this classiﬁcation
without appraising other factors. Each student so
classiﬁed will be reclassiﬁed prinr to induction. The
recent decision by National *3-elective Headquarters
requiring the reclassiﬁcation of students originally
placed in Class I-D or 1-12  extreniely important, for
it compels the local board to determine for each stu-
dent individually whether he shall be classiﬁed in
I-A or II-A. For the most part. students who are
physically ﬁt will then be placed in Class LA and
called for induction at the end of the school year.

If this is done automatically and without careful
concern for the best interest of total defense, there will
be a serious loss to the nation. Selective Service regu-
lations provide for the occupational deferment of the
individual who is preparing for an occupation essen-
tial to the “national health, safety, or interest” and who
is potentially a “necessary” man.

Professions Essential to Defense

The Subcommittee on Military Affairs of the Na-
tional Committee on Education and Defense and the
National Academy of Sciences have attempted to iden-
tify some of the professional ﬁelds essential to national
defense. They include: medicine, dentistry, and phar-
macy; biology, bacteriology, and any other branch of
biological science which bears directly upon problems
of medicine or the public health or safety; chemistry;
physics; geology and geophysics, including meteorol-
ogy, hydrology, and cartography; engineering, including
civil, electrical, chemical, mechanical, agricultural, san-
itary, and mining.

No student should request occupational deferment
simply on the basis of personal convenience. The de-
cision should be made only after carefully thinking
through two questions: Is the ﬁeld for which I am
preparing essential to the national health, safety, or
interest? Have I advanced far enough, and do I pos-
sess qualiﬁcations making me potentially a necessary
man in this ﬁeld? The faculty member who has
been given the responsibility of advising students on
Selective Service questions will be of genuine assist-
ance in making this decision. In many institutions,
when deferment seems wise, the university oﬂicial en-

dorses the student’s request by a letter to his local
board.

SA Relations

Things are picking up on the ed-
ucational all-American front as far
as Chile, Colombia, and the rest of
Latin and South America are con-
cerned.

Coincident with the arrival of a
group of Chilean students in Pitts-
burgh on one leg of an intellectual
good will tour of the United States,
comes an offer for trading cultural
ideas with Colombian students.

“El Estudiante,” a national stu-
dent organ of the Federation of Co-
lombian students, has requested——
through the department of state—-
articles from students in the United
States. Considering the way the
state department has muifed cer-
tain other matters, this information
is very lucky to have escaped the
red tape. But fortunately the am-
bassador at Bogota, Colombia was
on his toes and got himself heard.

And he has managed to inform
the chief of the division of cultural
relations of the department of state
that “El Estudiante” is especially
interested in articles written in
Spanish by American students deal-
ing with the general culture of the
United States and with student life
and campus activities in our univer-
sities. Pictorial material is also
welcome.

Along with this exchange of ar-
ticles, the Colombian student fed-
eration also has suggested an ex-
change of university student news-
papers.

And along with the exchange of
articles and student newspapers, an
exchange of worthy students has
been pretty well hashed out by au-
thorities and will soon be up for
the ﬁnal o. k.

All this cultural relationship is
one beeg order, but responsible per-
sons have shown clearly the need
for a complimentary understanding
of the peoples to our south,

Orloff, Wilde, Ames Must Win
For Underdog Cathedral Team

0 By SHEME BAZELL

Headed for the toughest. assigninent of the season, a polished
squad of Panther swinnners journey to New Jersey as defending
champions in the annual Eastern Collegiate swimming association
championship tussles. today and tomorrow at the Rutgers univer-

sity pool.

Rutgers. Franklin and Marshall. and Pitt will be the three

teams leading the ﬁeld in the battle
for supremacy of the Eastern cir-
cuit. Brooklyn, Lafayette. Lehigh,
and NYU are looked upon as the
“nuisance" squads in the race, be-
ing only strong enough to take val-
uable second and third place points
from the top contenders, while the
entries from Carnegie Tech, CCNY.
Delaware, Manhattan, and Western
Reserve, can do little more than
gain experience.

Rutgers Favored

As things look at present. from
the respective records of the teams
and individual swimmers. Rutgers
seems to have a far superior squad.
But a little pencil work as to how
and in what events each of the
three top teams are likely to win
points proves the fact that the race
can be much closer than is ex-
pected.

‘Rutgers has only one outstanding
swimmer on its squad. But in Jer-
ry Levin, the host team has the best
all-round tank star entered in the
meet. He can swim in the 50, 100.
220, 440, and in both relay races.
and easily win all of them in a
breeze. The rule book, however,
permits him to participate in only
three events.

Without Levin, Rutgers wouldn’t
have the slightest chance of win-
ning the relay races, giving the
Panthers a chance to cop first place
points in either or both of the
events. If Rutgers’ coach should
decide to use Levin in the relays,
then he can use him in only one
of the four free style races, leaving
the coast clear for Panther victories
in the other free style events.

Pitt Divers Tops

Of course, Franklin and Mar-
shall will be in there battling too.
But the Lancaster squad seems to
be in the same predicament as Rut-
gers, having only Dick Price to car-
ry the burden of the free style di-
vision, whereas the Panthers can
call on Joe Orloff and Gus Wilde to
divide the free style duties.

On the reserve list, Rutgers has
free stylers Olsen and Millard, the
Diplomats have Gager and Kachel.
To match this, the Panthers can
use Herb Cosgrove, Al Samson, and
Marty Kramer.

With Dick Ames and Joe Kaule
handling the diving duties, Pitt
should easily pick up valuable points
in the spring-board exhibition, since
none of the contesting schools can
show more skillful performers. Pitt
has little chance of victory in the
breaststroke and backstroke events,
although Herb Cosgrove might
come through in a runner-up spot
for the breaststroke.

‘Nuisances’ Help Pitt

Rutgers and Franklin and Mar-
shall will be ﬁghting tooth and nail
for both the backstroke and breast-
stroke victories. The Diplomats will
be using Badoff in the former and
Berger in the latter, while Rutgers
will swim Whitestone and Starr in
the backstroke and Zubko and
Haag in the breaststroke.

One or two dark horse swimmers

from the other schools will be mak-
ing it plenty tough for both Frank-
lin and Marshall and Rutgers in the
back and breaststroke races. Galley
of Lafayette, O’Connell of NYU, and
Simpson of Lehigh have all record-
ed fast times in these events this
season. Here the “nuisance” teams
will be aiding Pitt. By winning
points in the above events. they
will be preventing F&M and Rut-
gers from going too far ahead of
the Panthers in races where the
Pitt entry is not too strong.

Brooklyn May Trouble

Brooklyn, with Gross and Gates
in the free styles, D’Amico in the
150—yard backstroke, and Ledman
‘-or the 200-yard breaststroke divi-
sion, might prove troublesome in
some of the races but not in many.

The outcome of the meet de-
pends almost entirely on the way
each coach manipulates his team so
that he can gain the maximum of
points with a minimum of swim-
mers. Although Pitt won last year’s
championship with a point total of
over 60, this year’s winner proba-
bly won’t need more than 45.

LaSpada Smashes
High Score Mark

Larry Laspada, riﬂe team ace,
shot a record score of 97 out of 100,
standing, last week to give himself
a total score of 387 for four posi-
tions; but the riﬂe team still failed
to win a match.

Five of the seven teams shot have
sent back scores, and indicated that
LaSpada’s heroic effort was for
naught as Ohio State, Tennessee,
Iowa State, Wisconsin, and South
Dakota State all had higher team
scores.

Larry’s score was the highest sin-
gle score shot this year and his
standing record hasn't been match-
ed in years.

Pitt Tankers Defend ESCA Titles

Panther Trackers Seek
First CIC Championship
Since 1934 at South Bend

. By BEN room:

Seeking their ﬁrst title in the Central Intercollegiate conference
championships since 1934, twelve Pitt trackers entrained yesterday for
South Bend. Indiana, where the annual CIC event takes place tonight

and tomorrow.

Last year a Pitt squad,
journeyed to East Lansing, Michi-
gan, and ﬁnished a scant four points
behind the winning Marquette ag-
gregation that tallied 351/2 points.
Notre Dame was far down with
23% points.

Of course, Hap Stickel and Bill
Carter, the speedy junior stars are
favored to duplicate the one-two
performance of 1940 in the 75-yard
dash. Stickel should also add the
low hurdle toga to the sprint title.
A new record is not out of the
realm of possibility for the blonde
Adonis in either event.

Another South Bend lad returns
to the scene of his high school tri-
umphs; Red Jessup will try for the
pole vault crown before his neigh-
bors. His vaulting companion Dus-
ty Rhoades will also ﬁgure in the
scoring. The pair was off form in
New York last weekend, and must
redeem themselves tomorrow night.

Other members of the Pitt squad
who participate in the qualifying
trials tonight are Larry Tregoning,
who was runnerup in 440 last year
and is a favorite this year, Regis
Larkin, another 440 entrant; Joe
Newman, who placed third in the
high hurdles at South Bend his
sophomore year; and Bill Benghaus-
er, football husky counted on for
points in the shot.

Only member of the cast that won
the runnerup points in last year’s
test absent for the 1941 contest is
Johnny Bazyk, senior weight star
who took the shot put title. Frank
Ohl and Al Boulanger didn’t even
make the trip last year and Al Fer-
rara took ﬂu at East Lansing. Del
Anderson was ineligible.

This year, however, the outlook
is much brighter. Zeke Sterner,
senior two mile star who ran a
brilliant third in the ICAAAA meet

riddled by

injuries

and ineligibilities,

' -A ..
WALTER STERNER
good for a. second

in New York last weekend, should
take at least second at South Bend.
His running so far this campaign
has been much better than any
Boulanger ever did indoors.

Anderson, who remained in Pitts-
burgh last year, goes to his home
town to demonstrate the old “local
boy makes good in the big city”
philosophy. On the basis of his
l:56.5 performance at Ann Arbor
two weeks ago, he must be cast in
the favorite role in the 880. Del
will also anchor the mile relay
team; he ﬂashed through a dazzling
quarter in the anchor leg at Madi-
son Garden last Saturday night.

Dave McDowell will ﬁght for
points in the high jump title which
he shared with two others last year,
and Tregoning, Larkin, and An-
derson will run the mile relay with
Bud Graf.

Phi Kaps’ Glenn Captains Annual
News All-Intramural Floor Team

. By ALEX ZELENSKI

With the closest intramural race
in years at a close, the Pitt News
All-Intramural basketball team
once again shows the domination
of fraternity passers, who swept
four out of ﬁve ﬁrst team positions.

Phi Kappa’s Jack Glenn was
named the outstanding ﬂoorman of
the year, and given the honor of
captaining the all star team. A1-
ways among the leaders in scoring
and a ball hawk on defense, captain
Jack led his team to many victories
this year, but their championship
visions were just a little out of
reach. It was his third consecutive
all-intramural nomination.

The independent circuit’s only
performer on ﬁrst team was Jack

Dear young man from Johnstown:

It was with a guilty conscience
that we read your letter in answer
to boss McE1wain’s riﬂe team anec-
dote. Since we were the one who
informed the sports editor of the in-
cident, and since we profess to know
something about the sport, we de-
cided that we ought to straighten
out the situation and clear up all
misapprehensions we might have
caused.

O Riﬂe Team Divided

One point we want to make em-
phatic, any man who wants to shoot
on the riﬂe team is welcome to try
out, regardless of whether or not he
is in the ROTC.

The riﬂe team here, as in most
schools, is made up of two divi-
sions, varsity and ROTC. Obvious-
ly, only ROTC men may belong to
the .-latter, but any male who is eli-
gible for other sports in the Univer-
sity is eligible to shoot the 22’s. The
fact of the matter is that assistant
coach Sergeant Macdonald is al-

ways bemoaning the fact that not
enough men try out. Maybe more
than one student had the wrong im-
pression about requirements.

When you mention our lack of
publicity for the riﬂe team, then
you cut us to the quick. In this we
have fallen down. But maybe the
fact that gruesome details don":
make pretty reading is one of the
reasons. Nr one can argue that
the riﬂe team has given us anything
to rise and cheer about in the last
few years. So far this year the var-
sity team has just held its own
with eight wins out of 16 matches
while the ROTC team hasn’t won
any out of 12.

0 Little to Describe

Your letter suggested that we
write some informative articles :le-
scribing the sport. That would be
ﬁne, only there’s not that much to
describe.

It’s easy. The varsity team has
10 men and the ROTC team 15.
Each man ﬁres 10 shots in four po-

sitions: prone, sitting, kneeling, and
standing. A perfect score is 400;
our team averages 360 to 385 for
the men who place. The ﬁve high
scores comprise the team score and
the ten high ROTC scores make
their total.

0 Honor System

Most of the matches, almost all
to be exact, are postal matches.
Pitt’s team ﬁre their records on
Thursday and Friday of each week
and then send their scores to the
competing school. The other schools
do likewise. (This sport is gooey
with honesty). Upwards of ﬁve
teams are shot each week.

The very nature of the competi-
tion makes it tough for us to re-
port because scores keep straggling
in for a week or more after the
match is shot.

We hope this clears up the situa-
tion satisfactorily, so adios, young
man, and you too may keep your
bolt open.

Alpha, gets the nod over “Wild
Bill” Fitchko, Independent star.
Carlson, playing his ﬁrst year in
the fraternity league, came through
in remarkable style for he has been
a “one man team” for the PiKAs
this past season.

Carlson plays the pivot spot very
well, and is especially good at get-
ting the ball off the banking boards.
Fitchko plays a different type of
ball than Whitey, specializing in
long shots.

“Hack” White, silent member of
the championship SAM team, re-
ceives a forward post on ﬁrst team.
White is the ball handler, p‘ay
maker, and steadying force of the
I-F crown bearing team. His rug-
ged build gives him a great ad-
vantage in contact under the basket.

Earl Pressel, Phi Gam forward,
and Morris Mayer, teammate of
White, were the choice for second
team. Pressel plays the same brand
of ball as White, but does not seem
to have tile ﬁnesse of his rival.
Mayer has been the high scorer of
the Sammie team all year, but he
also does not have the all around
quality of his teammate.

The second place Fijis placed high
scoring Bobby Thurbon on ﬁrst
team. Thurbon started the season
in whirlwind fashion, but after a
spell slipped to mediocrity. How-
ever, his early season form gained
him enough favor to cop the guard
position.

Artie Hurwitz, speedy forward
of the Sammie team, gains special
notice for his remarkable play in
the last crucial games of the sea-
son. If he had played more often
he would have clinched a ﬁrst team
berth, but his lack of games lowers
him to the honorable mention col-
umn.

. . . when he wrote

“Whats in a Name?”

The Bard of Avon was right about the rose-its name
is unimportant. But if he’d had anything to do with
mining telephone exchanges, he’d have learned a lot!

Names must be easy to pronounce and transmit—must
not look or sound like other exchange names—must
not use the same dial finger spaces.

Take MUIR and OTIS, for example. Fine!—except
they dial alike! For the first two letters of each appear
in the same ﬁnger spaces on the dial

Often hundreds of names are listed, studied, discarded
before one is found that meets all requirements. Such
care in every phase of Bell System work helps to make
your telephone service the world’s finest.

Whynot telephone home often ? long Dis-
tance rates to most points are lowest any
night after 7 P. M. and all day Sunday.

National Poll Reveals

Opinions on

Drinking

Students Maintain Conservatism
In Attitudes, Yet Many Do Drink

AUSTIN, TEX., March 7-Although college students are as a whole
not teetotalers and a majority may be classed as liberals on the question

of drinking, there exists today on the campuses of America

amount of conservatism regarding

Two years ago this March, Stu-
dent Opinion Surveys of America
conducted a nation-wide poll that
for the ﬁrst time provided a com-
plete picture of drinking habits and
sentiment among collegians. The
survey has been repeated, and be-
sides producing a new set of fig-
ures on this topic, the study brings
proof that the sampling procedure
used by Student Opinion survey is
of such stability that its results may
be interpreted as an accurate bar-
ometer of college thought from
coast to coast.

In summary, these were the re-
sults of the survey, taken through
the cooperation of the college press,
including the Pitt News.

1. Six out of every ten believe
that college students do not drink
too much. '

2. Nearly seven out of every ten
men, and nearly five out of every
ten coeds admit they drink alco-
holic beverages.

3. Eight out of every ten are

' opposed to the return of prohibition.

, The 1939 survey and the present
one, taken in identical manner, re-
veal figures that are almost parallel
in every respect, giving new basis
to the fact that by means of samp-
ling it is possible for the Surveys
to gauge what the total enrollment
of nearly 1,500,000 thinks. Prohi-
1:-ition and drinking in general are
rather static questions on which
sentiment is not expected to vary
considerably for long periods of
time, and hat is what this compar-
is»:m shows:

~ 1939 19-41
. Believe students don’t
drink too :much.. . . . . .65% 61%
Admit they drink (both
men and women) . . . . .60 61

Opposeil to prohibition. .78 81

The percentages above appear to
indicate that during the last two
years there has been a slight trend
toward heavier drinking in college,
accompanied by» a similarly growing
trend in opinion against another
(try era. Buttthese differences are
so small that it would be going be-
yond thostatistical limitations of
the poll to say that they are deﬁn-
itely indicative of a change.

“Do you ever drink alcoholic bev-
erages, such as beer, wine, cocktails,
or highballs?” was the
asked. Of the hundreds of students
interviewed in every section of the
country only three refused to an-
swer. 'I‘he small number of no
opinion answers in all of the ‘ques-
tions have been eliminated from
the computations. .

Drinking, sectional returns show,
is heavier (more than .70 per cent)
in the New England and Middle
Atlantic states. In the” West cen-
tral states only half of the students
say they drink. H

Graper Outlines

Nlodol lVomon

. By BILL JAMISON

The atmosphere was charged, lit-
erally, with electricity. The place
sounded like a riﬂe range. A Pitt
News reporter had been admitted to
the elevator control room on the
thirty-eighth ﬂoor.

Eavesdropping while H. E. Bren-
nan, superintendent of elevator
iaintenance, explained the ma-
chinery to two other visitors, he
found what makes the elevators
run—sometimes.

Four huge motors, which furnish
the power for the high elevators,
rum shrilly, each accompanied by
its own little generator. Switches,
known technically as relays, ﬂash
and crackle on a large panel. An-
other panel of instruments has the
exclusive job of opening and clos-
ing the elevator doors.

By screaming at Brennan, the re-
porter learned of the ﬂoor selector,
a set of little buckets on a chain
which dictates the ﬂoor at which
the elevators will stop. Each par-

Questionnaire Shows University

Women M ake Good Employees

Do college girls make good employees?
A questionnaire sent out by the dean of women’s office gives the

answer as overwhelmingly “yes.”

Employers of Pitt National Youth administration rate the girls high

in honesty, level—headedness, loy-
alty, and initiative. They even like
their looks, with 85.5 per cent class-
ed as “excellent” in appearance.

The questionnaire invited frank
appraisal of NYA girls. These are
students paid by the government
for their services as stenographers
and part—time secretaries in offices;
or as group leaders for sports,
games, arts, and crafts and other
activities in recreation centers.

The University is an NYA em-
ployer as is the Board of Educa-
tion. In no case is a girl given a
position where ordinarily a’ worker
would be paid at the employer’s ex-
pense.

A high percentage of the Pitt
workers rate “excellent” in 10 qual-
ities that include promptness, cheer-
fulness, health, voice, and adapta-
bility.

There are 232 women students
and 101 employers on Pitt’s NYA
roll. Of these, 90 employers sent
back ratings on 129 girls. But not
all employers returned answers for
each of the characteristics.

Of those evaluated for appear-
ance, no student was called “unsat-
isfactory.” Seventeen were listed
as “satisfactory” and 103 were class-
iﬁed as “excellent.” Similarly, em-
ployers gave top ratings for cheer-
ful dispositions to 107 girls, while 15
were found “satisfactory” and not
a single “sour puss” was named.

A letter was sent with each ques-
tionnaire by Mrs. Frances Holland,
assistant to the dean of women. In
the letter she explained the purpose
of the survey. Correction of atti-
tundes, and better performance are
among the uses to which the study
will be put. It will serve, she ex-
plained, as a basis for discussion in
group meetings. It will also be used
in “follow-up interviews with in-
dividual girls who need to discuss
their attitudes toward and perform-
ance on their NYA jobs.”

Lt. Frank Avbel, ’4:0 . . .

of the Marine corps, will make an
official visit to the University dur-
ing the period of March 25 to April
10 to interview and give a prelim-
inary physical check-up to appli-
cants desiring admission into the
marine corps under the new plan
described in the Pitt News last
week.

Approximately eight men will be
accepted. Application blanks and
information pamphlets are now
available at the military depart-
ment.

ticularly loud crash was explained
as the sudden stopping of the freight
elevator.

The continual noise of the room
was oppressive. Since the reporter
was not suffering from boiler-room
deafness, Brennan’s explanations
sounded something like this, “This
machine controls the nuummmm,
bang, crash, bangbang, crack.”
Though he was trying to be help-
ful, the maintenance man was no
match for the control room.

Up on the thirty-eighth ﬂoor is
the heart of the elevator system.
There, amid the roar of motors and

the crackle of electricity, is the
force that controls the ups and
downs of students and faculty.

“Very few people have any idea
what goes on behind a simple eleva-
tor ride,” said Brennan.

He is right.
