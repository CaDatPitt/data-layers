nounced Wednesday.

University Board » of ‘ Trustees
approved preliminary plans and
specifications during the past week.
New York architects, Eggers and

‘Higgins, will begin actual plans ‘

soon.

The new building will rise on a
tw0—acre tract of land directly be-
low Pitt Stadium and across from
Children’s Hospital. The site has
already been cleared for excava-
tion and construction, with the ex-
ception of a few business build-
ings on Fifth Ave.

The eignt-story building will
give the school its ﬁrst permanent
home since its founding in 1948;
Public Health students have been
using facilities in Municipal Hos-
pital by special arrangement with
the city. Dr. Thomas Parran, dean
of the school, said estimates are
not yet available regarding cost of
construction. ' ’

However, he added that $5,-
000,000 of anoriginal $13,600,000
grant from the A. W. Mellon
Educational and Charitable trust
which established the school,
was earmarked for construction
of permanent quarters. ~

clude two - unique features-—an
“anechoic” chamber and a cobalt
room. In the soundproofed “ane—
choic” chamber, physicists will be
able to conduct measurements of
sound, hearing and noise without
troublesome interference from re-
flections or echoes which would
otherwise invalidate measure-
ments. '

Hamilton Reports Low Attrition
Due. To New Screening of Players

To silence traditional jokes

about scholastic_ abilities of
athletic scholarship recipients,
‘Captain Tom Hamilton‘, direc-
tor of athletics, offers a report of
honor grades of chief players on
various athletic teams.

According to a report on athletic
progress, during the
Spring semester, 1953-54, the rate
of attrition due,_to scholastic diffi-
culties was below the previous fall
semester. Progress was attributed
to careful screening of prospective
student players by the athletic de-
partment.

At least 20 per cent of the total
athletes achieved a 2.0 quality
point average or better for the sec-
ond semester, 1953-54. Honors
ranged from 2.0 to 3.0.

Team quality I point averages
ranged from 1.35, for wrestling’s

 Don't Strain Yourself

You are a lazynshiftless, indifferent entity who ﬂoats

around in circles, never deviating from your pattern of.
\activities, never looking‘ to the right or left, and never

giving excess indications of life.

it The foregoing statement is not necessarily correct, but
an impression very similar to this could be easily come—by-as
a result of the student-apathy which you so prominently

, display as part-time inhabitants of this University.

If a university is to serve as more than a basis for a

grading curve, it must doso through the efforts of the stu-

dents‘ themselves. Indifference to activities, which are a

direct reflection of the school, has caused comment. Harm-

ful ’comment. No credit can be given students for this lack

' of interest which has resulted in a picture of a Pitt Pep
jpjrally, appearing in the downtown papers, with a caption

which indicates that only a handful of students are show-
ing enthusiasm. »’ _

No ﬁngers can be pointed at the papers for. printing
such a picture. It’ was the truth. Because of this_prom1-
nently displayed‘ passiveness on your part, the University
of Pittsburgh can be legitimately held up to pub_11C’I'1d}-
cule as an example of a school which lacks such basic quali-
ties as the ability to turn out students for pep rallies.

You sit and cry because we don’t have a winning team.
Then, when the team wins, you stop crying but you still
sit. ‘When you finally drag your overtaxed frame home-
ward, the seat of your well worn pants reflects your atti-
tude as -well as the passing parade of students who follow_

ou.
,y Three of the most deserving activities on campus get
the go-by as a’ result of your dormant state of being. The
Pitt Players work long and late to produce a show _very
close to professional standards and then play to .a half
empty house because you are too insipid to take advantage
of the opportunity to View their efforts. ' i
Chaplain Luccok stands at Heinz Chapel and speaks

to a few of you who have the intelligence to realize that

you just might possibly derive some beneﬁts from his
many years of learned travel and knowledge.

And the cheerleaders comprise the majority week after
week at pep rallies as you remain blind to the possibility
of learning a little about the students who comprise your
school and why they show enthusiasm while you heighten
the gleam on your posterior. _ I

You apparently cannot muster even the minute en-

. , thusiasm needed to stop in the eighth ﬂoor and have a free

picture taken for your yearbook.

And you’ve got the nerve to gripe because the tuck
shops are too crowded during the ﬁfth hour.

By Jim Deweese

Each student in a university or college is in-
fluenced either directly or indirectly by the stu-
dent newspaper of his school. The adequacies as
well as the inadequacies of such inﬂuencejformed
the focal point of the 30th annual‘ conference of
the Associated Collegiate Press last week in Wash-
ington, D.C. _

Six hundred‘twenty-ﬁve from 5
34 states, the District of Colum-

colleges and universities as the 
conference convened Thursday 
Roscoe Drummond,
chief of the Washington Bureau i
of the New York Herald Tribune,
and James Russell "Wiggins, man-
agin’z editor of the Washington
Post, ahdr,essed the assembly on ' j
the importance of newspaper writing from a stand-

 

\point of coverage and completeness.

News“Jobs Discussed

Following the general assembly, sectional meet-
ings were scheduled,for the remainder of Thurs-
day and throughout Friday. These meetings dealt
with topics such as “Student Government and the
College Press” and “The Place of" Student Publi-
cations in'the Educational Process.”

The purpose of the convention was to afford

Careless Wording Reflects Attitudes

in a die qu a c ies S howni

 

‘ criticism and- ideas -for college newspapers with

the top professional newspapers of thecountry as
the criteria for this criticism._ J

The Pitt News was once again rated at the top
from a standpoint of news" value and, coverage.
But the need was pointed up for an additional out-
let‘ for stories not conforming to strict news style.
Such articles as large feature stories or picture
stories on events directly concerning ‘students,
faculty, or administration cannot be handled in’:
twice‘ Weekly paper such as the Pitt News._

And here at Pitt there is, a deﬁnite need for I
p more complete coverage of events. Long articles
containing helpful background information cannot

be’ run in the paper nor can such items, as the Uni-
versity Announcements. With a total enrollment
of approximately 15,000, a means of keeping in
closer touch with the student body is clearly in-
dicated. ' '
World Coverage Needed

A need for editorial commentary ‘on world and
national events was also indicated. Buta twice
weekly paper must concentrate on the student
body and events in and around the university which
directly effect the students. Perhaps the inability
of two papers a week to keep the students informed
is one "of the reasons for the lack of enthusiasm‘ in
school activities which appears so ‘much in evi-
dence here at Pitt. I

I found a note Wednesday in
the Tuck Shop addressed to the
pledges of a . fraternity and
opened it. Its message glared up
at me as I unfolded the paper.

" “All Protestant pledges

T h e " g r i m

of its message
were not even,

\softened, by

“welcome.” In

whole meaning of a non—sectari-

and its spirit dissipated.

Mannequins «Used J
For First Work

By CECY LINCOFF

(Editor’s Note: This is the
fourth in a series of_- articles on
the schools within the University
of Pittsburgh.)

Upon acceptance into the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh .School'of
.Dentistry, each freshman has a
complete se.t of mouth x—rays

taken. He is then assigned to a
nior dental student and together

they discuss diagnosis and treat-

ment plan for the freshman.

“This,” says Dr. William F.

. Swanson, dean‘ of. the dental
school,” makes the student more
conscious of his own work.”

The first two years of the dental
school program are spent on class
room and laboratory work. Pre-
liminary lab work is done on

mannequins. I

Faculty Counsels
The junior and senior years are
mostly spent working in the Den-
tal Clinic where students receive
practical experience.

The Dental Clinic is open to
students,‘ faculty, and the pub-°
lic. Under the superision pf
dental instructors, students treat
patients.

‘ At the beginning of the junior
year, students are assigned to
faculty counselors in groups ‘of

dent advisors throughout the
junior year. 1

No more than 96 students are
admitted into the School of Den-

only for that number. V

Acceptance to the School of
Dentistry does not require a de-

gree from college-, but 60 credits
are minimum-30 required and
30 elected.

“They have a big powerful team

for Florida without giving any
explanation; When they did not

come out for practice Wednesday,
the Captain announced that they
had been dropped from the squad.

Hamilton called the develop-

ment, “The Worst experience I’ve
ever had in athletics.” The interim
head coach went on to say that,
“Running out on/the team in the
middle of the campaign with a
big game coming up isn’t fair to
the coaches and it isn’t fair to
the team.” He then added, “The

Meanwhile the Olsonmen wound
up their drills yesterday and will
have a day of rest before the big
one tomorrow. Coach Olson has
been well pleased with the per-
formance turned in by his ruun—

ﬂners to date," and is hopeful that
they won’t let down when they
take -on the Lions.
Schubert Hurt

 Injuries continued to plague the

Olsonmen as Jack Schubert ac-
cidentally spiked himself in a
workout this week and is. a very
doubtful starter against the Lions.

On the other side of the ledger,
Jim Moore has recovered from a
leg injury‘ and should take up the
slack in the Panthér’s devasating
lineup that has already shellack—
ed five straight opponents this sea-
son. v

Against Penn State, though, the
Olsonment expect a much tough-
er time for the simple reason that
these two schools have been bit-
ter rivals down through the
years and when they clash, the
unexpected is most likely to hap-

' pen.
Record Unimpressive

State seems to come up with a

good team year after year, and

this year is no exception. Their"

record may not be‘ as impressive
as the Blue and Golds’, but they
have some boys who on a given
day can give anyone trouble.

In more speciﬁc terms’ their
names are Douglas Moorhead and
Ted Garrett. Garrett is a former
high school state champion who
transferred from Skyscraper U.,
and undoubtedly would like noth-
ing better than an upset over his
previous alma mater.‘

Hills May Hinder

Coach Olson explained that he
has a determined bunch of boys
this year and— they want to go all
the way. Concerning the Lion
contest, he stated, “I hope those
long hills bother them.”

As a rule, the Nittany Lions do
not run over the hill and ‘dale
type course the Panthers present,
but are used to more of the straigt-
away course. This could prove to
be the advantage for a win.

The two rivals did not meet last
year but previous engagements
always proved close. »

ATTENDANCE at college foot-
ball games is increasing across the
nation in a report issued at the
halfway mark. Crowds at Pitt
Stadium are also on the upswing
as the Panthers have drawn almost

50,000 more in the ﬁrst four games.

A Study. 
Of Mystery

By DAVE MAZER
‘ Sports Editor

 

 

The incident that took place this week concerning the
trio of footballers who left the University for better climes
elsewhere, is a study of mystery. '

It seems that no one in the athletic department or any
of the football players know why Ed Stowe, Joe Los, and
Gene Steratore departed for the South.

When the action occurred Tuesday evening, word
spread like wildﬁre through the University although
official Word did not come” through "until Wednesday at
practice.

Captain Hamilton deplored the departure as one of the
worst events he has seen in his career. Students and others
just wondered what the whole story was all about. ‘

As to Stowe, the mystery was the greates
string guard since the opening kickoff, he’
has been quite prominent in the Panther for-
ward wall ‘although notspectacular. The,
Somerville, N .J. junior was known to hav
left school previously last year for som
unknown reason but soon returned, so noth
ing came of it. . S _

' Los, the second-string guard behind
Stowe, was a converted fullback. He
played line-plunger for the freshmen two
years back but Red Dawson switched him
last fall and considered Los “one of the

most promising linemen we have.”

A ﬁrst-

 

    
  

 

 

 

 

Steratore

The third member, Steratore, could possibly have ‘the

best reason for going. A starter in a few ‘games last season,
the Washington, Pa. junior was. used very sparingly this
autumn. He kicked the extra" point in the Southern Cal con-
test but since then hasn’t done much. ’

If anyone, Steratore might have logic for his move simply
because he wasn’t playing. But still, even though he wasn’t
a varsity member, dropping from the squad at such a crucial
point, has got to have a reason.

The only basis we have is a message left to Harold
Hunter by the trio. It read: “We’ve gone South for the
winter,» big boy.” ,

This certainly doesn’t indicate any valid reason but it’s
the only th'i'n‘g to go on until more is found out.

Boaters   Rely on g D ’Amato 0

By MIKE BAER

With Mike Culhane a doubtful
starter, high scoring John D’Amato
will assume a heavy load when
the Panther soccer team takes on
rugged Franklin and Marshall at
Pitt stadium tomorrow,

D’Amato and Culhane have
scored all but one of the Pittites’
goals this season and with Culhane
out of the starting lineup with an

depend on John to give them the
necessary punch to upset the Dip-
lomats. V '
Franklin and Marshall, unde-
feated thus far this season in
the tough Middle Atlantic Con-
ference, was picked as the num-
ber one team in the nation last
season by the Soccer Coaches
Association of America.

In order to take some of the
pressure off D’Amato, Coach Leo
Bemis plans to vary his orthodox
ﬂying W attack. In the ﬂying W,
the ball is brought down the sides
and fed to center D’Aamato in
front of the goal. The center can
either shoot the ball at the goal
or pass back to the outside in a
similar fashion to the pivot man
in basketball. This system makes
the center forwardthe prime scor-
-er. - '

Bemis plans to use what he
calls an M attack instead of the
W should the latter fail to get re-
sults. In the M, the inside for-
wards are closest to the goal with

the end zone unmolested.

The early moments of the sec-
ond quarter found Sigma Chi, this
time‘ with six men, on the move
again until Richie Harrison inter-
cepted a poorly thrown pass. The
Lam's ‘finally registered the tying
