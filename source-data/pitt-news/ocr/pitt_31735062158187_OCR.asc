Sixty-‘eight percent of students polled by’ the Pitt News

Out of 1970 students who“wer__e asked their preference of a

.The University Police Depart-

ment, with ‘the approval of the
Dean _of Students Office, V carried
out an orderly, well timed inves-
tigation of ‘Schenley House resi-
dents Friday between 11 a.m. and
1 =p.m.’ This was done, in an effort
to learn the identity of the van-
dal or vandals 2.who have been re-
movingoﬂoor buttons from the two
elevators in Schenley House. .
University officials, - disturbed
by the recurrent disappearances
of the buttons, felt it was neces-
sary that some action be taken in
order to avoid _f_urth‘er expense
and inconvenience. _
’ Acting ‘under a pre-arranged
plan, two..oﬁicers blocked off the
stairways leading from -the ﬁfth
floor. Another ofﬁcer . took con-
trol of the ‘elevators to prevent
anyone from _entering or leaving
the dormitory section of
building without having passed a
ﬁfth ﬂoor checkpoint. At the same
time, the ﬂoor proctors
those students who were in their
rooms to report to the ﬁfth ﬂoor.
Previously, the elevator but-
tons had ‘been coated with" an
invisible phosphorescent mix-
ture in such a.way that their
~ removal would leave . an invis-
ible mark, detectable only under ,
ultraviolet light, on whoever
touched them.- .

OPanthers move to the North Side

if a new Municipal Stadium were
constructed there. The other 268,
13.6 percent, said that they didn’t
care where the games are played.

’ The poll, which .was taken
— last Thursday, Friday and Mon-
, day throughout the University,

was prompted by Tom Hamil-

ton’-s proposal calling for the
. conversion of Pittstadium into

a Municipal Stadium.

Hamilton stated that if the
Panthers move to the North Side,

they »will’ decline as .a national,

football power. _His plans would
keep the Panthers here as well
aspsave the city some 'ten_.mi1lion
dollars in construction, costs.

It is not known if Chancellor -

Litchﬁeld has already committed
the Panthers to the new‘ stadium
although some sources claim that
he has. His committal, they ‘say,
was necessary for the North. ._Side
plan to be accepted.

The results ‘of the poll will be
referred to the administration as
a reliable Sampling of‘ student
opinion on the issue.

Many Students
Add Comments
To Poll Ballots

Not satisﬁed with checking_ one
of the three alternatives in the
Stadium poll, a large number of
students wrote some comments .on
theirpoll slips. " ‘ '

One comment made by a num-
ber of students was “get rid of
One student
wrote that none ‘of the- choices
would mean anything until “Mich-

elosen is replaced by Mr.  Bren-T 

nan.”, ‘ o. . o
A couple of other students wrote

that they think Captain (Tom);

Hamilton “should _\mind his own

business.” ‘» _
Not wishing- to exclude any-

‘ one from criticism, another stu-

dent asked “Why. did you waste‘ ' "

the paper? Can .we decide or
does the Chancellor (Litchﬁeld)
_ do that, too?” _ A

One student suggested building

a drive-in municipal stadium.‘ He _
says that this would end the park-__’

ing problem and enable the fans
not only to see the game, but lis-
ten to it on their car radios. Con-
"tinuing, he says that this idea

_ would. also solve the expense -of ~-
‘ a lighting system for night games.

All the cars could turn on their
headlights, he suggests. ~

“Discontinue football and refund V
student activity card money," one

individual said. . —

Finally there was this state-

ment. “I ‘think this is ridiculous.

*My.opinion does not mean a .thing. '_

This ‘problem was decided even

of this

     
  
 

before you politicians ”even’thought.

stated “it has no particular

functions.” ‘

Later in the meeting Whittier
said he personally felt that MC
should be given another chance.

John Gooding stated that he
wants MC to continue. He said,
“The only reason to dissolve
seems- to be that it hasn’t
‘jelled.’ They say there are no
activities for Men’s Council ‘to
conduct.” ’

John Strauch, Arts ’60, suggest-
ed that Men’s Council could be
incorporated as a special commit-
tee of SGA. Ann Papieski, Ed. ‘59,
commented, “Men’s Conference as
a committee would be the same as
it is now. Just changing the group
to a— committee doesn’t change it
or dissolve it at all.” ' 2

Further discussion was halted
pending -Denis I_.it.chman’s return-

In appreciation of his m

eritorious basketball contribu-
past four years, SGA President

Bert O’Malley will presentDon Hennon with a bronze plaque
from his. fellow-students beforethe Penn-State game at the
Field House this Saturday night. The presentation will be

made around 9 p.m. ‘

Thus an era in the history of
Panther basketball comes_ to a
climax when the. All-American
from Wampum_ plays his ﬁnal
game in Blue and Gold against
the rugged Nittany Lions.

Coach John Egli’s Lions
downed the Jungle Cats at Uni-
versity Park last month by a
67-58. score. State’s Mark Du-
Mars, who was a teammateof
John Fridley at Sharon High
School, held Hennon to 17 points
in the initial meeting and will
try to duplicate that feat Satur-
day; Fridley also tallied 17
markers in that contest.

' Joining the 5-10 DuMars in
State’s starting lineup are‘Wally
Colender‘ (6-2), Tom Hancock
(6-5), Bob Edwards (6-5), and
either Paul Sweetland’(6-5), Ted
Kubista (6-5) or Jon Musser
(6-5). ‘

Tomorrow evening Coach Bob

Timmons’ Jungle Cats tackle the
tall Titans of Westminster \at the
Field House. The opening tipoff is
slated for 8:30. In last December’s
encounter at New Wilmington the
Panthers came out on the short
end of a 78-66 score.

Hennon was outscored by the
Titan's Chuckie Davis in a tor-‘
rid two-man duel, 34-30, and
will be out for revenge against
the little star from Brooklyn,
N.Y. “Davis should play for the
Globetrotters instead of a college
team,’ Timmons said after the
ﬁrst contest.

The boys from New Wilmington
will also show Don lVIcCraig,
Dave Rankin, John" Walker and
Ron Minnie in the starting lineup.

I They are coached by Buzz Ridl

who likes nothing better than to
beat Timmons’ Jungle Cat ag-
gregation. _

Can the Panthers come
back? That’s the question’ Rex
Peery’s matmen will try to
answer Saturday night at the
Field House when they take
on Penn State as the prelimi-

nary to the basketball game be-
tween _the same» "schools. The
wrestlers willgo -to work at 7 p.m.
' The‘Panthers will be trying to
ﬁnd if the winning combination

-again after their ﬁrst loss of the

season to Lehigh last Saturday.
They had previously won eight in
a row, The Nittany Lions will by

"no means drop over and play

dead for the Peerymen.

The Staters have w.on seven
and lost‘ two. On their last out-
ing they downed Syracuse, 29-2,
while the best the Panthers
could do against the Orange
was 16-12. Both teams have met
and defeated Maryland, Army
and Navy. ‘

The two set-backs suffered by
the Lions came at the hands of
Cornell and Lehigh, the two best
teams in the East. Their other win
was at the expense of Colgate.

Close matches are expected in
the 136, 137, 157 and 167 lb. divi-
sions. In the 130-lb. class, Pitt's
Larry Lauchle who is‘ undefeated
will tangle with Don Johnson.
Lauchle is expecting a tough
match. ‘

“This will be my ftoughest
match of the season,” stated the

Muncy, Pa. Sherm Moyer, the
Panthers’ 136-lb. man, will also
meet stiff competition as he
faces Guy Guccione who is un-
defeated this year.

Peery was very disappointed
after last week's loss to Lehigh.
“We should havelwon that one,”
the Panther tutor stated, “we had
it and let it go. In a couple of the
matches I felt the boys should
have won. Bubb did a good job
against Santoro."

Bob Bubb, Panther captain, suf-
fered a recurrence of an ankle
injury in the meet Saturday.
However, Peery feels he will be
all right bythe State meet.

In Dual Finale .

The Panther. tankers will be
looking for their seventh win of
theiseason as they enter/their last
dual meet at the Carnegie Tech
pool‘ this .Saturday.- Washington
and Lee University will offer the
competition as the Blue, and Gold
try to make it two an a row.

Washington and Lee reportedly
has a “good team,” apd the Pan-
ther tankers should “have their
work cut out for them,” Coach
Ben Grady said.

As yet the Panther mermen are
undefeated in their “home” pool

with wins over Nortli-Carolina
State and Syracuse. All three
losses have come on the road. '

The Panthers have won three
out of four meets, the only- loss
coming at the hands of little Ken-
yon‘ College. ~\ _

Grady has been hampered-in
the. last two meets‘ because he has
been without Tony Treser and
Lou Durbin. Both swiinmers are
