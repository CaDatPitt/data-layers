The medical school’s biochemis-
try department is being forced to
fill an assistant professor’s posi-
tions in the tenure track that was
never announced_ or advertised for,
according to biochemistry profes-
not Robert Glew.

The University Senate’s policy
regarding recruitment and
appointment, of regular faculty

imembers requires that a search‘

committee be formed to recruit
candidates for the position.
Biochemistry department chair-
man. Norman Curthoys, however,
denied-that such an appointment

had been made or was being co_nsi—, j

dered. “Since there's no appoint-

ment, there’s no reason to have a
search committee,” he said.

Glew said that at a ‘March 11
meeting of tenure biochemistry
faculty members, Curthoys
announced that William Kappel, a

post doctoral fellow at St. Louis M

University medical center, would
join Pitt's biochemistry depart-
ment in September, 1982.

The directive toappoint Kappel
was contained in a one-page letter
to Curthoys dated March 1 from
Dr. Robert Olson, currently the
director of Basic Science in the
medical school who formerly was
the biochemistry department
chairman at St. Louis. A

 

“I have exchanged apmemo with

’ him (Kappel) indicating that I will

recommend his appointment as
assistant professor of biochemistry
effective Sept. 1,” the letter read.
“He will be treated like all other
tenure track appointees as regards
the need for successful applications
for grants for research and willbe
evaluated in due time.”

Olson's .letter also said that Kap-
pel would be required to assist him
in his work, as well as complete
independent studies. I
. Curthoys’ March ‘ll memo,
which was supposedly read at the
meeting, contained a copy, of
Olson’s letter and said, “As you can
see from the attached letter, Dr.

  Medschool Directed On Appointment

Kappel will join the department as
an assistant professor as of Sept. 1,
1982.” ’

According to Glew, the Kappel
appointment was a precondition

for Olson's acceptance as director

of basic sciences. He said that when
he complained about Kappel being
hired, Curthoys told him that the
hiring “w'as for the good of the
medical school.”k

Curthoys denied this and said
that “anyone who claimed I said
that is distorted.“ He also said that
he didn’t remember a march meet-
ing being held and that there
hadn't been any meeting to con-
sider hiring Kappel.

Geography,

Grievance    

Rejected
BY FORREST BEERS.

An academic integrity grievance
against Faculty of Arts and Science ‘
Dean Jerome L. Rosenberg by the ,
Geography Department Graduate
Student Organization (GSO) has
been rejectedby an investigating
committee. ,

The Ad Hoc Committee for Geo-
graphy, which came out last week
with a strong statement in support
of retention of the department,
rejected the grievance on grounds
that it could find no evidence that
the dean deliberately worked for
the demise of the department.

In a written statement released
yesterday, the GSO expressed “pro-
found disappointment" with the
findings of the Ad Hoc Committee.

, The GSO charged that the dean
made specific agreements with
them which he later broke. Some of
these argreements were that the
dean would stabilize the faculty at
ten, and hire a chairman . of
national reknown. The GSO
claims the dean broke these agree-
ments by refusing to negotiate with
proposed candidates, withholding
appointment of faculty positions
and by issuing a termination
proposal.‘ .

Through these actions, the GSO
claimed, their educational oppor-
tunities have been limited and the
value of their degrees lessened
because of the shape of the
department.

The GSO sought to have the ter-
mination proposal withdrawn,
formal guidelines established for
grievance against administrators,
and proper adjudication made.

In its statement, the GSO said
the committeetwas knocking down
straw men. “Our grievance did not
concern the intentions of the dean,
yet the response of the committee
focuses closely on the question of
whether the (lean made his com-
mittment in good faith...the real
issue we raised...was one of effect,
no intent," the statement noted.

“The issue of debilitating nature
of the context in which the termi-

nation, proposal appeared seems to,

have been ignored by the commit-
contintterl on pag<’,[0_ur

Melby: Hostility Against Soviets Core Of U.S. Policy

C By MARGARET ATWOOD

No one high up in the adminis-
tration, except Haig who ought to
be fired, even knows in what direc-
tion Europe lies.

Couple this with the fact that
President Reagan is admittedly
unable to make up his mind on any
foreign policy issue and has a staff
that is directly opposed to each
other on every point, and you have

’ a foreign policy thatis not working

to the point of being dangerous.
These are a few of the conclu-
sions that John Melby, Chairman
of the Political Science, Depart‘-
ment at the University of,Guelph,
Ontario, ' Canada, reached last
night in -a lecture entitled “Does
Reagan Have a Foreign Policy?”
The lecture was ‘held in David

_Lawrence and was sponsored by

the Student Government Relations
Committee.

Melby, a former Foreign Service
Officer for the State Department,
was forced to leave his position
during the McCarthy (Red Scare)
because of having held posts in
both Moscowand China. In the
State Department his duties
included negotiations, political

P reporting, and information work.

During the lecture, Melby went.

from country to country, explaihg-

ing Reagan’s foreign policy prob-
lems and efforts. A

“Reagan’s foreign policy is

A based on three simple assump-

tions, which he held as a candidate
and holds now as a president. They
are:

-1. American is weak and we
must close the window of vulnera-
bility. We must gain greater respect
in the world and become equal to
the Russians in military power.

-2. Communism is the source of
all evil in this world. It is assumed
thatithe U.S.S.R. is seeking to con-
quer the world.

-3. In respect to human rights,
the totalitarians on the right are
preferable to those who are on the
left. The former are considered
anti-communist and the latter are
not,” he said.

Melby pointed to consistent, and

unremittent hostility towards the
«Soviets as the thread that ties

together our present foreign
policy.
Pointing to a prediction made

over 150 years ago by visiting‘,

Frenchman assigned to study
American prisons he said, “The
future of the world will be deter-
mined by a struggle to the death
between American democracy and
Russian autocracy.”

“The Reagan administration is

carrying out a policy of unrelent-
ing hostility,” said Melby, “to the
Soviet Union.” ‘
‘ The only reason that we have
disarmament talks is because of a
tide in the American community of
respectable people who are
demanding them, he said.

Melby claimed that if we got out

of El Salvador the Russians would-

probably become disinterested in
their war.

“The U.S. ought to get and stay
out. Let the Latinos handle the
situation. Let someone do it who

John Melby, chairman of the political science department
at Guelph, Ontario, told a Pitt audience last night that
hostility toward the Soviets is the thread that ties together

U.S. foreign policy.

knows about the Latinos. The Rus-
sians‘and the Cubans have as many
problems of their own as they can
handle,” he said. '

to use military force in El Salvador,

administration filled with officials
who have little understanding of
foreign peoples and their political‘
problems.

“The administration is itching
to make asses of themselves over the
Arabs, and they have little under-
standing of Arab politics,” he said.

Pointing to the disunity within
the top administration officials
Melby said, “Washington is begin-
ning to sound like the Arab league
at 1[S worst."

Reagan could

turn to the
National Security Council (as C1316)
ter did) because of the political in? ‘

fighting between the Secretary of
State and the Secretary of Defense,
but Clark who now heads it, an old
friend of Reagan’s, could not even
name the president of France,
when questioned by Congress.  A

“How one man who doesn’t
know anything about foreign
politics talks to another who
doesn’t know anything. ..well it
must make for sparkling reparte’,”

vacuum and that’s a luxury that’
simply can’t afford. It’s a danger-
ous and internationally precarious
position,” he said. ,

With the arms build-up, the psy-
chological climate is such that we
are getting very close to a nuclear
‘war, according to Melby.

“Reagan is taking very, serious
risks. I’m not sure he realizes what
he’s doing," he said.

- Dedication
For Annex

State and federal officials
along with corporate and foun-
dation leaders joined in Fri-
day’s dedication ceremony of
the l0—story Education and‘
Research Center (ERC) at Pitt's
Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic (WPIC).

The ERC was built to house
WPIC’_s educational and
research activities, freeing areas
in the original structure for the
Institute's. expanded’ clinical

programs which serve over
9,000 patients yearly. The focal
point of the ERC is a dual-level
library, housing the largest col-
lection of psychiatric literature
in the world. .

Plzrrtt1itigf()r this $6 million
annex began in the fall of 1978.
With financial support. from
private foundations, corpora-
tions and the National Library
of Medicine, ground was
broken in October I979. Eight
floors of the ERC are already
occupied; the remaining two .
will be occupied in l982. '

According to Dr. Thomas
Detre, Director of WPIC, “The
additional 65,000 _ square feet
provided by the ERC will
greatly relieve overcrowding in
the Institute due to expanded
outpatient services
development of specialized pro-
grams for children.”

WP-IC‘s staff has tnore than
doubled in the past seven years,
and the budget for federally-
funded research has ‘grown
from $300,000 to over $6 -mil-
lion annually.

WPIC houses the Depart-
ment of Psychiatry of Pitt's
medical school and provides
education and research services ‘

Hand-In-Hand Festival's
‘Budget Examined By

   

’,._.s_____.z*.

Student Gov. Board

By LAURIE McicLEOD

Educational or not educational?
That was the question the Student
Government Board (SGB) pon-

‘dered while reviewing budgets for

recognized student organizations
at Monday's meeting.

The Hand-In—Hand Festival’s
budget was rejected after a 1% hour
deliberation and a split 4-4 vote
with President Todd Deluca cast-
ing the deciding vote. He said SGB
could not fund Hand-In-Hand
because too much money goes to a
charity.

Deluca said it is against univer-
sity policy to fund a charitable
organization directly or indirectly.

The Hand-In-Hand Festival's

budget was cut from $3,999.18 to L

$808.15 by the Allocations Com-
mittee because it was considered to
. he mostly charitable, although the

’ ‘V mmittee recommended funding

everything before the festival
including the educational sessions.

Allocations Committee chair-
man Bob Colosimo said everything
before the festival is educational
but the festival itself is purely
charitable.

“We are allowing the program to
exist,” he said. “It has gone on in
the past, and I’m sure it will in the
future.”

Hand-In-Hand Festival repre-
sentative Bg‘iar1Balk said his organ-
ization believes the real education
comes the day of the festival. He
said the educational sessions are
just for preparation and the festival
provides “first hand experience.”

Board member Chip Roth said
he also felt the entire program is
educational. He said the entire pro-
gram shouldibe looked at as one,
instead of deciding educational
benefits as specifics.

“I. think it's time to change uni-

versity policy. I don't know of one '

person who didn't feel his activity
was wisely used the day of the festi-
val.” said Roth.

“We are funding a clearly educa-
tional activity,” said board
member Spencer Davis. “They are
offering a single day where 1,500
students have the opportunity to
work with handicapped children.”

Board member Robbie The’ said
the problem with the budget was
finding the distinction between
educationa-Land charitable items.

“I think the Allocations Com-

mittee did a good "job finding the‘

distinction between the two,” he
said.

emotions and feelings hinder the

A group of South Oakland resi-
dents are about halfway through
the training period to become
Pittsburgh's latest chapter of the
Guardian Angels, according to Jeff
Jameson, community organizer of
the South ‘Oakland Citizens

So far volunteers have under-
gone physical training
includes self-defense and CPR cer-
tification. They have had mock
patrols in Oakland for the past two
weeks and will receive legal train-
ing such as learning what they can
and cannot do when making a citi-
zen’s arrest. They will also receive
training in first aid before their
graduation which is scheduled at
the end of next month.

Pennsylvania

Guardian Angels
Almost Ready   

Although the Pittsburgh police
haven't taken an official stand con-
cerning the Guardian Angels, the
Number 4 Police Station on Sem-
ple Street has been very supportive,
Jameson said.

Patrol routes will be co-
ordinated with the police so they
are sure to cover the areas where
crime is most concentrated, and the
Angels will make the police aware
of when and where they will be on
patrol.

“Crime here is getting bad and
the police are restrained in man-
power and motor vehicles," said

‘Jameson.

The Oakland patrol is com-
prised of eight to ten high school
students. One Pitt student began\
training but, due to a demanding
school schedule, was unable to
continue and plans to participate
in the program over the summer.

Will Najanick and Bradley Gib-
son, who were left in charge of the

Pittsburgh chapter when chapter 

founder "I".P. King left a few weeks
ago, are currently trying to sched-
ule a time next month when
Guardian Angels founder Curtis
Sliwa can speak at the'group’s
graduation.

With the end of the winter term
approaching, many students are
thinking of summer. 17 Pitt stu-
dents are already making their
summer plans-—which include
travel to Europe, Asia or the Mid-
dle East for study abroad.

Each year the Natio‘nality
Rooms and Intercul‘tural
Exchange Programs at Pitt grant
scholarships to university students
for study in foreign countries.
These scholarships are available as
a result of year-round fundraising
by the Nationality Rooms commit-
tees, the Nationality Council and
individual donors. According to E.
Maxine’ Bruhns, director of the
Nationality Rooms Program, it is
“volunteerism at its best.”

The winners of the scholarships
for summer study abroad will
travel to Austria, Czechpslovakia,
England, France, Germany, Greece .
Ireland, Israel, Italy, Norway,
Poland, Taiwan, Wales and
Yugoslavia.

The summer study abroad pro-
gram awarded its first scholarships
in 1948, and since that-time, 282

,.,students have been recipients.

Some of the scholarships are
granted through the various
nationality rooms, while others are
awarded by donors, often in
memory of a family member.

The scholarships are available to
undergraduate students who fulfill
specified requirements, have
earned between 60 and 90 credits
and will return to Pitt for the fol-
lowing two terms. Students who
apply select a program of at least

related and credit worthy.

An awards ceremony was held
Saturday, during which the award-
ees, along with their families, met
with the program’s donors and
committee people. The I7 students
accepted their awards and spoke
briefly about their plans.

Mary Stieber, a graduate student
in Fine Arts who is going to Greece
to study classical monuments,
accepted her award saying, “this is
a dream come true.”

A fascinating summer lies ahead
for Dennis Dirkmaat. Dirkmaat is
the recipient of the Mr. 8: Mrs. Mile
Rukavina Award for study in
Yugoslavia. He will travel to
Zagreb, to study Neanderthal
remains, which were uncovered in
the early l900’s.

“I'll be studying specifically a
subspecies of homosapiens called
Homosapiens Neanderthalsis,”
said Dirkmaat, who plans to base
his dissertation on this summer’s
study, which will conclude in
London.

Gary Chamberlin, a double.

major in English Writing and Ital-
ian, won the Italian Room Schol-
arship and will study at the
University of Florence. Chamber-
lin, a transfer student from Pitt’s
Johnstown campus, says “none of

major-—will be traveling to both
England and Sweden to compare
the health systems of the two coun-
tries to that of the United States.
Germany is Thomas Preston’s des-
tination, where he will teach a
“nori-traditional method of crea-
tive writing to third and fourth
graders.”

Pnina Levermore, winner of the

Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt ..

Award, will be accompanied in her
travels by her young son. The
mother-son team will settle in Novi‘
Sad to study the peasant market
system and become acquainted
with families in the area.

The other scholarship recipients
include: Nancy A. Flanigan, Ruth
Elizabeth Davis, Belinda J. Dun-

Q: What are some of the facts
and issues that affect abortion
services in Pennsylvania?

By KIM WOODCOCK

Pennsylvania’s present abor-
tion regulations were enacted in
1974 and based on the 1973
Supreme Court decision, Roe
vs. Wade. The court held that a
woman’s right of personal priv-
acies included the privilege to

have an abortion, with qualifi-
cations.

Within the first three months
of the pregnancy or the first tri-
mester, abortion is entirely the
women’s decision. The state
may regulate abor-tion follow-
ing the endof the third month.
After the end of the sixth month
or the second trimester, the fetus
is presumed capable of living
outside the womb. In this
instance, the state may regulate
or prohibit abortions except
when it is necessary to preserve
the life or health of the mother.
Performing an abortion in
these cases is up to the judge-
ment of the physician.

In Pennsylvania, a woman ,

can decide to abort during the
first six months of her preg-
nancy. During the first trimes-
ter, an abortion may be per-
formed in a licensed outpatient

clinic or a hospital. A complete
reporting of the procedure, the
age of the fetus and written
information consent of the
woman is required for each
abortion performed. During the
second trimester, abortions
must be performed in a
hospital.

Upon request, the Student
Health Service will provide
information on abortion facili-
ties, adoption agencies and
obstetrical care, and also pro-
vide urine pregnancy tests. Wel-
fare and many insurance
policies cover abortions,
including the Accident and
Sickness Insurance Plan
designed for Pitt students. This
plan pays up to $150 for an
abortion if conception occurred
while the policy was in effect.

Last I)ecem ber in Pennsylva-
nia’s House of Representatives,

a bill was approved that would
make an abortion more difficult
to obtain. This bill would have
required a 72-hour “cooling
off" period, a death certificate
for the aborted fetus, a second
doctor to be present to care fora
fetus if it is determined the fetus
could live, notification of the
parents if the woman is a minor
and notification of the father of
the fetus when possible. State
hospitals and clinics could not
perform abortions except in
cases involving rape, incest or
danger of ,maternal death. This
bill was vetoed by Gov.
Thornburgh.

()1) March I0, the Senate
judiciary Committee endorsed
an anti-abortion constitutional
amendment that will overturn
the I973 Supreme Court deci-
sion. The amendment would
en-power Congress and the

Healthline Answers Abortion Questions

states to restrict and prohibit
abortion, but the state legisla-
tures would be free to enact
more restrictions than Con-
gress. Debate on this bill will
now shift to the floor, where
amendments may be added.

One possible amendment,
Senator Jesse Helms’ measure,

the Human Life Amendment,

states that the fetus should be
considered a person at concep-
tion. Abortion would then be
illegal since the fetus has equal
rights. This amendment would
have to be approved by two-
thirds of each house of Congress
and three-fourths of the state
legislature to be ratified.

Congress has not yet acted on
the anti-abortion constitu-
tional amendment, a_iid so the
future of Pennsylvania abor-
tion laws remain unclear.

The news that hardly any so-‘called concerned students

" gave up Happy Hour last Friday to attend a speaker s

‘ forum on student aid cutbacks should come as little sur-

prise to anyone who has attended or worked at Pitt for a

reasonable amount of time. The Student Government

Task Force on Financial Aid; ‘SPOHSOYS Of the forum,

should have recognized the fact that Fridays are when most

’‘ students come down with that dreaded disease commonly
referred to as “Pitt Syndrome." ' '

i" Symptoms of Pitt Syndrome are usually diagnosed in
‘ students about one month after entering Pitt. These symp-
toms include, but are not limited to:

O Avoiding extra-curricular acti_vites that have anything
to do with furthering one’s education, such as debates,
lectures and seminars.

0 Attending most events in which the consumption of
alcohol is the central activity, such as fraternity parties,
dorm parties and football games. .

the editor in The Pitt News, °ng statements contrary
to university administrative icies and questioning
‘those same policies in regards to tuition hikes and the like.

IA general fear of “ma5i. ves” through letters to

While these are only a few of the symptoms associated

, ‘with Pitt Syndrome, they nonetheless serve to characterize

a common affliction of many Pitt students and faculty.

Using the example oflast Friday’s speaker’s forum, what

follows are some suggestions that organizers of that event

- and similar ones to follow should take heed of when faced
with an outbreak of Pitt Syndrome.

For starters, organizers of the speaker’s forum were all
wrong when they decided to hold the forum in David
Lawrence Auditorium. Not only does the place reekyof
academics, but since half the student body goes there for
Ted Windt’s Presidential Rhetoric and Trevor Melia’s
Rhetoric in a Free Society class, why agitate the fire mar-
shal by filling the auditorium to capacity more than
necessary?

We suggest holding the forum in either an Oakland bar
on a Thursday 'nighi, where loud, obnoxious crowds are
virtually guaranteed, or in Pitt stadium duringhalftime,
where equally loud and obnoxious crowds are the norm.
With this strategy,‘ not only will the organizers get the

track when they announced that the forum was going to
"deal with student aid, or the lack thereof. If there's any-
thing that burns students out—-especially on Fridays--it’s
‘ the thought that they might have to listen_ to a couple of
political windbags talk about the future of education in
this country. Instead, the organizers should have given the
forum a catchy title like “Subliminal Seduction in Student
Aid Cutbacks” or “Sexual Images in the Financial Aid
Line.” Chancellor Wesley Posvar’s office wouldn't be
large enough toaccommodate the crowds that would
result.

Finally, the choice of speakers guaranteed a sparse
crowd. What student has ever heard of Cyril Wecht, Doug
Walgren, Frank. Pistella or William Coyne? On the other
hand, if the Student Government Task Force on Financial
Aid had presented Dan Marino, Terry Bradshaw and a
sideshow featuring female mud wrestlers, then they might
have gotten the desired attendance. Come to think of it,
maybe they should have brought in the Silencers or the
Iron City ,H‘_o_iise Rockers to talk about student aid; they
may not know much about th‘e subject, but they sure can
draw crowds. , -

Forum a P
Causes Shock,
Embarrassment

‘Dear Editor: .

In the Friday, Mar. 19 edition of
The Pitt News, the headline article
concernedthe federal cutbacks to
student aid programs (“Merante:
Student Aid Cut in Half”). Accord-
ing to Pitt’s Office of Admissions
and Student Aid Director Joseph

‘ Merante, “Student aid at Pitt will

be cut back 50 percent next fall, and
more than half of the entire student
enrollment will be directly
effected.” i _

- Interestingly enough,’ also on
Mar 19, a coalition of student
groups at Pitt sponsored a “speak-

and the ever-popular Cyril Wecht, ‘
not to mention representatives of
Arlen Specter’s office, PHEAA and
Pitt’s Financial Aid Office.

It was through .the concerted
efforts of many students, affiliated
with several different organiza-
tions, that these representatives,

'_ were contacted and were kind

enough to come to Pitt, ready and
willing to answer the questions of
the “concerned” students who par-
ticipated in the collecting of thou-
sands of signatures on petitions
protesting these cuts, not to men-
tion various other activities con-
nected with this forum, I felt
compelled to write to the editor of
The Pitt News, concerning the out-

come of‘ the “forum.” My overall \

reaction was one of anger, embar-
rassment, shock, bewilderment and
disgust...toward my, fellow stu-
dents at this university. It saddened
me to realize that, with a student
body of over 35,()()0, not even 10
percent could manage to attend a
forum put together strictly for their

of democracy will be replaced by
“elitism,” if, in fact, the middle
class no longer has a choice con-
cerning an education. Tobe sure,
the social programs put together
during the l960’s have been
abused; this fact iswell-known. It
seems to me, however, that the Rea-
gan Administration has taken the
easy way out by simply attempting
to dismantle these programs. The
real challenge, as I see it, is to eval-
uate the programs, trim the fat and
make them more accountable.
‘Business concerns itself with
cost/benefit analysis, constantly
re-examining, re-evaluating and
looking for ways to become more

hardly convinced that this is the
case. .  — 4
Why are ;these cuts directed at
education? I think the scene -at

Friday afternoon was a symbolic
- answer to that question. Our apa-

ing President Reagan’s and David
Stockman’s orders to cut budgets
across the border, the heads of fed-
eral agencies will cut programs
that involve the least-organized
people in order to minimize public
outcry. Student aid programs have
been among the first to be cut.
Windt went on further to strongly
“hint” that without organization
and involvement we students
might as well say good-bye to our
aid programs. I feel that Windt is
correct. Pitt students do not seem to _

The Inside Story:

The Hand-In-Hand Festival, sche- ,

duled for Saturday, March 27th
from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., is a
community service that is organized
annually by University of Pittsburgh
students and supported by the
Office of Residence Life. The Festi-
val, now in its fourth year, is aday of
recreation and activity for an
expected 450 physically and/or
mentally handicapped children of
the Greater Pittsburgh area,
according to Mary Maher, coordina-
tor of the Festival.

“This is the biggest,_ single event
for handicapped children in West-
ern Pennsylvania-,” said Maher.

The Festival is a day filled with
color and excitement for excep-
tional children and the university
community. Activities include
puppet shows,__ - magicians, skits,

mimes, bands and a variety of I,

tﬁbttis. Types of booth activities are
face painting,"pitc"h for goldfish, ring
toss, finger painting, sponge throw
and Hand-In-Hand cookies, accord-
ing to Maher.

In the past years, the Hand-ln-
Hand Festival has been a success.
The first Festival was March 31,
1979. Approximately 125 excep-
tional children, 300 student volun-

teers and many community groups .

and businesses participated in that
fun-filled day, Maher said.

Mr. Gary Baughman of the
Allegheny County Chapter of the
Pennsylvania Association of
Retarded Citizens (PARC) recog-

-nized the Festival as “an excellent
idea that works’ well because there is
something for everyone, from the
severly retarded to the highly
functjoning.”. ; _ . .

According to Beth Painter, coor-
dinator of the Festival, the second
and third Festivals in 1980 and 1981
attracted many more children and
community groups and businesses
while expanding its facilities. The
thirdgﬁestival was recognized state-
widebv Governor Thornburgh.

“The Hand-In-Hand Festival is a
most fitting way to illustrate the
commonwealth’s commitment to
meeting thegoals for the full partici-
pation of disabled citizens in our
society,” said Thorburgh.

“This is the second year the

\

mayor has proclaimed the third
weekend in March, Hand-In-Hand
I-estival Day in the city of Pitts-
burgh,” said Maher.

The; Festival facilities, located in
the Forbes Quadrangle building, will
be decorated with Disney charac-
ters representing this year's theme,
“The Land of Magic.”

. This year, Sam Davis, former def-
ensive line captain of the Pittsburgh
Steelers, will be the honorary chair-
man, Maher said. ‘

According to Maher, the pur-
poses of the 1982 Hand-In-Hand
Festival are: .

0 Provide an afternoon of recreation
for exceptional children in the
Greater Pittsburgh community as
well as for students at the University
of Pittsbugh.
0 Break down the barriers between
communties and the exceptional

‘citizens, with ' emphasis’ on the
members of the university
community.
0 Develop personal relationships
between student volunteers and
exceptional children on a one-to-
one basis.

.0 Familiarize Pitt students with the

. needs of mentally and/or physically
handicapped children. '
0 Allow the children as much self-
expression as possible.’

“The Festival benefits the kids,
but it benefits the students, also,”
said Maher. “It is a goodexperience

- for Pitt students.” A

“Some students are afraid of
handicapped children,” Laura Wins-
low, a committee chairperson, said.
“The Festival will help students real-

» ize that they are just kids.”

There are certain procedures that
the Festival committee has set up.
Before the Festival, student volun-
teers attend -an orientation_sessi,on.
explaining the procedures of the

day. Student volunteers are paired, ‘

one-to-one with each child guest.
The volunteer serves as the child’s
friendand guide through the activi-
-ties of the day. This pairing also
helps in the control and safety of the
child.

The participating institutions will
be required to accompany their
children and provide an appropriate
number of professional staff, Maher

Maher said. -1

Identification codes for the Festi-
val will help‘ in the overall DtQcedu-
res. The clowns will be the registra-

 tion guides. One-to-one volunteers

will wear a name tag. The children
will receive a Hand-In-Hand T-shirt
and wear a name tag. The staff/ facil-
itator will wear a staff shirt and a
facilitator cap and emergency per-
sonnel‘ will be in uniform. Occupa-
tional and physical therapists will
wear a facilitator cap and a name
tag. .
Each year the ‘Festival committee
depends on donations frorri various

‘ organizations.

Most of the money comes from
group foundations such as Gulf,
Pittsburgh National Bank, Rockwell
International, Alcoa and Portec Rail-

road, according  Maher.

Through these contributions and
volunteer work, the Hand-In-Hand
Festival will bring a “Land of Magic”
into aispecial child’s life-

‘ _, Even though'the Hand-In-Hand
‘Festival is only a 9one-day event, its
preparation is a year-long process.

‘To organize the festival, which

‘accommodates over 400 handi-‘

capped children from the surround-
ing areas, thel-land-In-Hand staff
works throughout both the fall and
winter semesters. The 90-member
student staff is divided into several
committees, each of which has its
own responsibilities and duties.

VOLUNTI -
MITTEE EEK COM

Next to the children, the student
volunteers comprise the most
essential portion of the festival.
Each child is paired, one-on-one,
with a student volunteer.

“The festival gives the students
the opportunity to learn about hand-
icapped individuals in a controlled,
protective setting,” said Volunteer
Committee chairperson Wendy
Boyd. ‘

The student volunteer is informed
about the distinctive needs of the

handicapped at variousieducational
sessions conducted during the
month precedingthe event. These
sessions feature slide shows of pre-
vious festivals, basic first aid proce- I
dures and a run-down of what to
expect on the day of the festival.
“The educational ‘sessions
expose the student to things hemay
not be used to about these special
kids. We basically teach them every-
thing they will have to know because

they’_re going to be the kid’s guard- I '

ian for an entire day,” Boyd said.

Within the past four years, the
festival has grown greatly in scope—

~this year over 400 children are

expected. Today, more than ever,

The Forbes Quadrangle annex is
transformed into a multicolored,

of the Decorations Committee. The
decorating theme of this year’s festi-
val is “The Land of Magic.” ,

The Decorations Committee
plans to use-familiar characters as
the basis for its decorating.

“With well known characters
(such as Disney) the children will
relate a feeling of happiness and joy
when they are recognized. Even if
the children don’t recognize the
characters they still add an atmos-
phere of color and fun,” said Beth

tAungst, chairman of the Decora-
tions Committee.

The Decorations Committee is C

also responsible for designing the
backdrops ‘ for the booths, the
advertising banners and posters and
the T-shirts for the festival.

CEEMPUTER COMMIT-

In this age _gf__mode_rn_ technology
even t'he‘l:l'a-nd-in-Hand Festival has
taken advantage of progress, with
the Computer Committee.

 The Computer Committee regis-

ters important information (such as
medication) about every child in the
memory banks of the computer.

“If emergencies were to suddenly
occur, it is important to have quick
access to a child’s vital information,”
said Rick ‘Rocktashel, Co-
Chairperson.

Committee members are respon-
sible for typing any letters needed in
mass quantity, which in itself takes a _

lot of responsiblity off the other A

committees.

The Computer Committee also
plugs the names of every volunteer
or anyone associated with the Festi-
val into these permanent storage
units . A ~

“It is a lot of work putting every--
one in the computer’_s storage
banks, but it really pays off in con-

venience on the day of the festival,”
said Rocktashel. 1 '

BUEDGET COMMIT-
TE ..   a

With a_ budget exceeding $10,000,
it is obvious that the Budget Com-
mittee is essential for keeping the
books balanced. V

“The biggest problem with the
budgeting is that we’re never sure

where, when or how much money -

should be allocated. We’re always
left hanging, because.we’re never
sure of how much our donations will
‘amount to if they comethrough,”
said Laura Winslow, co-chairperson
of the Budget Committee.

The Budget Committee must be
aware of all the moneyvdealings that
take place. A

“If it weren’t for the paper work,»

my job would be a breeze, but then
again, if it weren’t for the paper
work, there wouldn’t be a need for
the. Budget Committee,” quipped

Winslow.

FOOD COMMITTEE

How are all those hungry tum-
mies satisfied on the day of the festi-
val? This is the Food Committee’s
sole purpose. ’ ‘

“I never realized how much food
1000 people could devour until Isaw

— last year’s festival’s lunch, said Aly-

-son Steinberg, chairperson of the
Food Committee. “Now I’m prepar-
ing an extra surplus of hamburgers
and ice cream to make suref’
Although the lunch may seem
brief, months of preparation go into
organizing this meal. “We-started
way back in September writing let-
ters for donations, followed up by

phone calls.” Ste-'inberg said. “It’s

‘pretty tiresome, but the food donors
have been great. We really couldn’t
ask for more.” ’

place throughout the day.

The main stage (located in th
center of Forbes Quad.) will host a
variety of acts which children of all -
ages enjoy. For example: a magi-

The Activities Committee also .

supplies the clowns. “We get a great
response from the students. It

Graham.

BOOTH COMMITTEE

The Booth Committee is in
charge of organizing the 40 booths
for the festival. Every booth is spon-

“Our booths give many organiza-

Some of the varous booths
include Lambda Sigma’s Pitch for

Often the handicapped are hid-

tival because many times these
exceptional children never get the
opportunities that we, as children,
took for granted,” said Janet Zibrat,
co-chairperson of the Institutions

Tliie Institutions Committee is
also responsible for obtaining all the

important information about each

“The statistics areneeded so that

each child can be properly paired ‘W

Many of the children attending
the-festival need special attention.
This is why the Medical Service
Committee was formed. The day of
the festival, 20 Emergency Medical
Technicians (EMT-1) and one
dozennurses will be on hand to
administer medicine and to treat
any emergencies that may occur.

“Our medicallytrained personnel
are ready for any emergencies.
We’re there to reassure the student
volunteers that they shoudn’t hesi-

tate to ask for any assistance,” said.

Howard Natter, chairperson of this
committee. _

Each separate committee serves
a specific function toward the festi-
val and its goal. Even though it -is
only a one day affair, monthsof
preparation by these committee
{members are necessary to make the
Hand-ln-Hand Festival a huge
success. .

Fun And GamesAt The

It’s 11:00 and the children.are
arriving. Preparations have been
in progress since September for
this long-awaited day. Clowns
greet the children at the door for
registration. Student volunteers ,
are looking forward to meeting
their friend for the day. Parents
give last minute instructions to
the staff at the registration tables
and join the parents at the recep-
tion. . ‘

Once all the formalities are
completed, there are several
options open to the young
Quests. Thereis jewelry making,
face painting, miniature golfing
and treasure hunting.

Also, the Pitt Choral Ensem-
ble is singing on center stage.
The children joinin the singing,

and wide grins depict the fun and
laughs they are sharing. The
stage brings many other exciting
events by Delta Delta Delta sor-
ority, and FlJl fraternity, a ven-
triloquist and even a magician.

The group Breakthrough per-
forms an interesting act by sing-
ing with their hands.

In the midst of all this non-stop
excitement, the children and
their hosts manage‘ to, find time

‘to eat a lunch provided by

Mc Donalds.

The children want to go back
to the booths and collect more
prizes. They try the nerf darts,
hit the can, bowling and para-
chute game. Outside they visit

animal friends from. the petting

their pictures taken to
remember this day.

Everything goes by much too
quickly, and the guests start to
prepare for a sing along which
begins to wind down a fun-filled

' day. Everyone joins in the sing-

ing and another round _of prizes
is distributed. ’

There is a bit of shut-eye and a
few happy yawns. Satisfied faces
and overflowing bags indicate
the success of the day. As par-
ents come to pick up their child-
ren, good-byes are said, hugs
and kisses exchanged and long-
lasting memories ' are estab-
lished. ‘ ’ A’

Sports  

Swimmers HaveHigh H

By SEAN BARNES

The NCAA Swimming and Div-
ing Championships will begin
tomorrow in Milwaukee with eight
Panthers representing Pitt. All
three of Pitt's top-ranked Eastern
relays qualified, as did swimmers
in six. individual events as Pitt

qualified, in one half of National’s

18 events. .

— “This is what we've been practic-
ing for all season,” said Pitt head
coach Fred Lewis. “I expect to
break every team record we have in
the events (in which) entered.”

This will indeed happen if the
eight Pitt swimmers swim as fast as
their post-Eastern tapering should
allow them. Seniors Rick Carter
and Sandy ‘Pidgeon know this is
their last, visit to Nationals, and
both expect their-taperedtimes to
win All-America honors, which go
to th_e top I2 finishers in each event.

Ed Bergan, VPitt’s freshman
replacement for the two-time All-
American Stu Swanson, already
shattered Swanson’s two Eastern
backstroke records at Easterns this
year. Bergan was awarded the Most
Outstanding Swimmer at Easterns
this year, as his name was entered

. on three new records: the 100- and

200-yard backstroke, as well as the
400-yardniedley relay. He will
swim all three events—one for each
d'ay——at Nationals. I
Pidgeon and Carter are also

A teamed with Bergan in the 400-yard

school swim team and was recruit-
ed by Lewis just last season. As a
freshman, Emore did well; but as a
sophomore, Emore is a National-
ist, swimming butterfly in the
relay. J

“His butterfly is the best looking
stroke on our team,” said Carter._
“His long arms’ give him excellent
stretching power.” J

Another Pitt sophomore, J.D.
McCrillis, also showed his
national-caliber freestyle talent by
helping Pitt’s two freestyle relays,
the 400- and 800-yard events, to
their National qualification.
McCrillis, like Emore, has come a
long way in just his second year at
Pitt. Lewis is encouraged to see
that six of his eight Nationalists are
underclassmen. _ I '

Jackson’s Swimming Career Ends Fittingly  

By SCOTT DELLETT

To be one of the elite in any
sport, including swimming, one
must have dedication and consis-
tency. Lady Panther swimmer Amy

Jackson has both of these qualities_

and that is the reason she became
only the fifth Pittathlete to earn
All-America honors four consecu-
tive years during the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletes for Women
(AIAW) swimming champion-
ships at the University of Texas last
weekend. '

Some athletes in Jackson’s posi-
tion may have an enormous
amount of pressure thrust upon
them by others, but Jackson
believes she was the only source of
her pressure.

“Making All-America was
something I wanted to do,” Jack-
son said. “No person or group put
pressure on me. It ws something I
really felt I could do.”

However, Jackson needed to
change» her plans for Nationals
after performing well at Easterns.

“I had a really good meet,” Jack-
son said. “I had to reset my goals
for Nationals. It was hard for me to
realize I could do better.”

Jackson got rid of the burden of
making All-America early Wednes-
day night as she finished sixth in
the 50-yard butterfly and then com-
bined with Sue Heon, Jan Ujevich
and Julie Terrell to finish sixth in
the 400-yard medley relay. Despite
reaching her goal, she was not
totally pleased.

“I was disappointed with the
race (50-yard butterfly),” Jackson
said.‘ “I didn’t have a good start,
and they left me in the dust. Ididn't
realize what it (All-America
honors) meant. I had to keep think-
ing ahead towards the next event."

Jackson admitted she was ner-

. vous before every event. She deve-

loped a routine to calm her down

\

it— with All-America honors.

before she gets on the starting
blocks.

“Although I was more nervous
during (National)_ finals in my
sophomore year, I was still very
nervous," Jackson said. “I isolate
myself and try to concentrate on

 

 

Senior Amy Jackson ended her brilliant tor-yea Pitt career muc the way she began

what I want to do at the race. I like
to check out my competition.”

For the rest of the meet, Jacs--

kon’s performance could have been
described in one word-—awesome.
The Newton-Square, Pa., native set
school records in the 100- and 200-
yard freestyle, along with the 100-

yard butterfly, and was part of the
400- and 800-yard freestyle which

also broke school records.

One of Jackson’s goal was to beat
Kathy Stetler’s record of earning
All-America honors in I9 events.

The reason for this goal was that‘

“I thought of'Kathy as a superior
athlete,” Jackson said. -“She
inspired me in a lot of ways. Excel-
lent is the way to describe how she
swam, and I wanted to realize Iwas
equal to her.”

This year was Jackson’s best for
several reasons. “I cut my best
times by a lot,” Jackson said. “I

easier to work hard. He makes
practices a lot more interesting.”

“Nationals was an outstanding
finish to an outstanding career,
and Jackson will have fond memo-
ries of her four years as a Lady
Panther swimmer.

“Swimming issomething I have
really enjoyed, and it will be sad to
go,” Jackson said. “Every year has
been different. Swimming has been
a big part of my life, and I'm going
to miss it.” ‘

Senior co-captain Julie Terrell
will also miss swimming for Pitt,
but right now, she is thankful for
the break from the sport.

“I'm glad to be done, but in a
couple weeks, I will miss it,” Ter-
rell said.

Despite some trying times, Ter-
rell believes she was pleased with
her career.

“It’s hard to say what was my
best‘ moment with swimming,”
Terrell said. “I was happy
throughout my career. As a whole,
I am satisified with my four years at_
Pitt.”

As for the team's performance at
Nationals, Terrell said, “We all
were really psyched. We had high
goals set, and we did the best that

Netters Face_
Colonials

By JOHNETTE HOWARD -

There are three~things members
of the Pitt Panther mens’ tennis
team can count on every season-a
net at midcourt, the use of rackets
and a consistently murderous
schedule.

Because of Pitt's relatively early
end to winter term, Panther Coach
George Diffenbach and his team
are annually forced to fit a three
month’s slate of meets into two
action-crammed ‘months.

This year is no exception. After
starting the season this past wee-
kend against three of the toughest
teams they will face all year—West
Bucknell and James
Madison—the Panthers» take the
court again tomorrow against local
foe Robert Morris.

Pitt (0-3) barely defeated the
Colonials 5-4 last season in a tough
match, and Diffenbach expects
more of the same tomorrow. While
Pitt returns only a few starters-from
last year’s lineup, Robert Morris
returns its team mainly intact.

Both of the Colonial’s top play-
ers from a year ago——No. 1 Tim
Fissinger and No. 2 Kirk Cooper-
return while the Panthers boast
new startersin the __t9p two slots.

Those team standings may.
change for_ tomorrow’s match
because No. 3 player Larry Lederer
defeated Berkovitz in a practice
challenge match last night.

 ASIAN CITIES A

History 190 A Tuesday 5:20-7:50 3 credits

Have you ever wondered wether city life in the United States is the same as city life elsewhere? Some obserevers have
argued that it “feels” the same to be resident in Shanghai as in Pittsburgh, while others have stressed the cultural
differences said to give rise to different urban patterns. This course, administered jointly by six Asian Studies faculty,
attempts to answer this and related questions by examining the origins anddevelopment of cities in Asia. Four themes
will predominate in out discussions of various cities in Asia at different points in their history: 1) the physical
environment of theicity and its evolution; 2) the individual urban dweller as citizen of a city and state; 3)the relationship
of the city to the countryside which surrounds it, and to other cities, and 4) the symbolic aspects of city life;
urban-based religions, festivals, and cultural life. A

This is the first time this course is being offered. In the future it may be offeredannually.

Short Winter Term Murderous For Netters,...

continued from page eighteen

Tonight Lederer will play McDo-
nald and, should Lederer win, he
could start in the No. 1 position
against Robert Morris.

Lederer was the only Panther to
win an individual match over the
weekend; Diffenbach said he was
especially pleased with the manner
of Lederer’s win—a come~from-
behind victory over Bucknell’s Eric
Simpson, and the junior transfer
student’s. subsequent performance
in the doubles match later that day
with teammate McDonald.

The Pitt duo lost -a hardfought
match to West Virginia’s John
Nilsen and Joe Chambers, 4-6, 6-
1,6-2. The WVU pair are both
highly ranked in the Middle States
regional ratings and the national
rankings, according to Diffenbach.

In the fourth through sixth posi-
tions, the Panthers probable star-
ters‘ in order are D.]. Mariano,
Lance False and Ashok Krisnas-
wami. Pending last night's prac-
tice, Diffenbach 7s<aid freshman
Mark Cohen could possibly replace
someone in either the singles or

doubles lineup.

In the doubles, Diffenbach had
been starting McDonald and Led-
erer as the No. 1 team, Berkovtiz
and Mariano at No. 2 and Flase and
Krishnaswami in the N0. 3
position.

Because of the Panthers’ dearth
of experience, Diffenbach admitted
this year’s team has required more
coaching and counseling than pre-
vious ones.

“We’re a good team. We have
some nice players, a lot of hard
workers, but we're basically still a
team of inexperience,” Diffenbach

said. “I have to do an awful lot of’

teaching and
players.”

As the season progresses, Dif-
fenbach predicted the team will
improve with each match as they
supplement their added experience
with practice work on theirstrokes,
strategy and mental and physical
preparation.”

The coach is hoping to surpass
the team's 7-5 record of last season.
Barring a fall to inexperience or
their fast-paced schedule, that is.

Football returns...

With the visions of the 1982
Sugar Bowl victory still dancing in
their, heads, the Pitt football team
kicks off its spring practice Satur-
day at Pitt Stadium.

The Panther team, which

favorites to win the national cham-
‘ pionship. First-year coach "Foge”
Fazio will have to steer the .team
through a tough schedule includ-.
ing ‘Notre Dame, _Florida State,
Penn State, North Carolina and
, West Virginia to get a shot at the
3' title. . ’

Spring drills are expected to run
just over two weeks—one week less
than was customary under ex-Pitt
coach Jackie Sherrill.

The league, which Pitt departs
from this year in favor of the Big
East, currently includes Rhode

Washington, St. Bonaventure,
Rutgers, Massachusetts and
Duquesne. ,)Although Dr. Leland
Byrd is expected to be retained as
commissioner, the, league’s official
offices may be relocated away from
Pittsburgh.‘

Talk has also been rampant that
the league tournament, a sellout

either the Meadowlands or the
WVU-Morgantown Coliseum.

Penn State returns to the league
after an undistiguished three-year

Tough AL East

By F. FORREST BEERS

-The only race in baseball’s
strongest division should be for
second place between the Milwau-
kee Brewers and the Detroit Tigers.
The New York Yankees should
have little trouble in wrapping up
the division title with the team they
have.

And what a team they have—a
manager’s dream.

Pitching, defense, hitting, speed,
depth and, for the first time in
years——harmony.

Volatile Reggie Jackson-is gone,
owner George Steinbrenner has
mellowed somewhat and
managerial situation is settled.

If the Yankees are lacking in any-
thing, it would be power; but even
in that department, Graig Nettles,
Oscar Gamble and Dave Winfield
have been known to hit a few out of
the park.

The starting rotation will con-
sist of Tommy John, Ron Guidry
and Dave Righetti, while Rick
Revuschel, Gene Nelson and Rudy
May vie for the other spots.

In the bullpen, the Yankees are
just as solid, "with Ron Davis and
Rich “Goose” Gossage handling
most of the calls.

Winfield, Ken Griffey and Jerry

the ’

Stadium outfield, with ample
backup coming from Gamble, Lou
Pinella and Bobby Brown.

In the infield, things are set
except at first base, where Dave
Collins and Bob Watson vie for the
job. Willie Randolph remains
fixed at second, Bucky Dent is at
shortstop and Nettles is the man at
third. Rick Cerone returns behind
the plate. '

Manager Bob Lemon has several
candidates for the job of designated

hitter, including Pinella, Gamble,.

Collins and Watson, as well as sev-
eral strong youngsters such as Steve
Balboni. _

By adding speedsters Collins and
Griffey to the likes of Randolph,
Mumphrey and Winfield,‘ the Yan-
kees should easily steal 200 bases;
they also won’t hesitate to eke out
an extra base on many hits.

Most of this Yankee squad has
proven offensive ability and as for

the team’s depth, it would be not

exaggeration to make the claim
that this team could be dividedinto
two squads and both would finish
respectably. .

New York should cruise to th
American League Pennant. -

The Milwaukee Brewers have
the extreme misfortune of having
to compete in the same division as
the Yankees. If they played in
another division, they’d surely be
the divisional champion.

Such is not the case, but the
Brewers enter the new season
unbowed and unchanged.

An awesome offense will be the
Brewers’ biggest asset, featuring
such sluggers as Gorman Thomas,
Cecil Cooper, Ben Ogilve and Ted

Simmons.

The pitching staff isagain led by
Pete Vukovich, who tied for the
league lead in victories last season
with 14. Vukovich is helped by
Moose Haas, Mike Caldwell,
Randy Lerch and Bob McClure.

In the bullpen, Milwaukee
boasts last year’s winner of the
American League’s Most Valuable
Player, Cy Young and Fireman of

the Year awards in Rollie Fingers. .

Jamie Easterly, Jim Slaton and
Dwight Bernard also work relief.

Paul Molitor has movedlback
into the infield at third base, and he
will work with shortstop Robin
Yount, second baseman Jim
Gantner and first baseman Cooper.
Simmons will catch.

In the outfield, manager Buck
Rogers will have Ogilve, Thomas
and youngster Mark Brouhard.

” Larry Hisle should be designated
hitter. '

A few years ago, the Detroit Ti- ‘

gers commanded laughs. This year
they will command respect.

The Tigers did some hunting.

over thewinter to improve their
lineup and came back to Motown

with "Chet Lemon, Larry Herndon,-

Enos Cabell and Jerry Turner.

Lemon and Herndon will start
in the outfield along with Kirk
Gibson, who has been likened to
Mickey Mantle.

The infield is Richie Hebner at
first, Lou Whitaker at second, Alan
Trammell at short and Tom
Brookens at third. Cabell will also
see action at first, and rookie How-
ard Johnson could challenge at
third.

Turner will be the designated
hitter, while Lance Parrish will
take care of catching duties.

Manager Sparky Anderson has
three steady if" unspectacular star-
ters in Jack Morris, Dan Petry and
Milt Wilcox. I)ave Rozema will
also be in the rotation, and George
(lappuzzello is being considered.

Kevin Saucier returns in the
bullpen, where he pitched to a 1.65
earned run average last season. He
will be aided by Aurelio Lopez and
Dave Tobik. The Tigers are still a
year away from the status of a con-
tender.

,LacrosseClub Wanted J AL East 

ﬁiﬁfrﬁrﬁﬁfrﬁﬁﬁ

Mike Connors organized his
first lacrosse club in high
. school in,Pittsford, N.Y., then
founded two more teams at
Ohio ‘State University and
Grand Valley State College.
Now, the sophomore transfer
student is trying to bring
lacrosse to the University of
Pittsburgh.

Connors. along with jun_ior
Randy Bardol, kick off the
effort today at 4 p.m. in Confer-
ence Room A of the Pitt Student
Union. For all the lovelorn fans‘
of lacrosse who were forced to

. east of Pittsburgh, Connors and
Bardol are hoping to offer some
solace.

Although there is already one
established lacrosse club » in
'Pittsburgh—— appropriately

named the Pittsburgh Lacrosse
Club—C0nnors is hoping to
offer an alternative to the more

takes.
“I want to stress that we don’t

rienced or have their own
equipment. We’re just going to
go out and have some fun right
now,” Connors said. “We’ve
always had a lot of participa-

abandon the sport after leaving ‘
Philadelphia and other points V

serious approach the PLC

care if the people -are expe-J

tion at other places where I
started clubs. Having a good
team is not the No. 1 thing right
now—the No. 1 thing is getting
people together."

It is that idea of new friend-
ships and lingering old aquain-
tances, road trips to other
colleges and the fun of competi-
tion that has prompted Con-

-nors to start this, his fourth

lacrosse club. He says he still
keeps in touch with friends he's
met through the sport in Michi- ‘
gan, Ohio, New York and New
Jersey.

And, as with the other clubs,
the group is expected to be inde-
pendently funded and not
funded by Pitt’s student activi-
ties allocations committee.
Connors has- already worked
out field arrangements, a 35
percent equipmentdiscount for
club members and a tentative
list of.possible opponents for
the team if play gets underway
this fall as expected.

In addition to the Pittsburgh
Lacrosse Club, Connors said
some area" teams such as
Washington and Jefferson Col-
lege, Allegheny Community
College and Ohio University
are ..projected as possible
opponents.

There are too many question
marks about this team.

What was always a strength of
the ()rioles—-their pitching staff-
started deteriorating last year. Des-
pite that, Weaver will go with the
same rotation of Scott McGregor,
Jim. Palmer, Dennis Martinez,
Steve Stone and Mike Flanagan.

Don Stackhouse and Tim Stod-
dard are the mainstays of the
bullpen once again.. 4 O

The Orioles are loaded in 0
fielders this year,’ but new
acquired Dan Ford, steady Al
Bumbry and Gary Roenicke will
_see most of the action. Displaced
Ken Singleton will move into the
designated hitter spot. »

In the infield, Baltimore has
‘Eddie Murray (one of the best in the
league) at first, Rich Dauer at
second, Len Sakata at short and Cal
Ripkin, Jr. at third. Rick Dempsey
will handle the catching duties
with help from Dan Graham.

Baltimore has some depth in
their young backups but lack the
overall quality of the division’s/
frontrunners. I

Are the Boston Red Sox for real?

 

Only» time will tell. The Sox s11r€*§:i‘§v

prised a lot of people with their
performance of last year, and
many, especially Manager Ralph
Houk,_feel they can repeat.

Real-ity may change his

I optimism. —

Boston IS weak in pitching. After
Mike Torrez and Dennis Eckersley,
the Red Sox will have to rely on an

I uncertain cast. _

In the bullpen are Mark Clear,
Bob Stanley, Tom Burgmeir and
Luis Aponte._ I ,

Jim Rice, who has slipped from
his phenomenal performances of
the middle and late 670s, is still a
solid ballplayer, and he will be
joined in the outfield by Rick
Miller and Dwight Evans.

I In the infield, the Red So); have"‘q‘il
. Carney Lanslord (who led the

league in hitting last year with a
.336 clip) at third, Glenn Hottman
at short, Jerry Remy at second and
Dave Stapleton at first, while Gary
Allenson works behind the plate.

Carl Yastrzemski and Tony
Perez will split the designated hit-
ter role. , I

The Red ‘Sox lack too many
important‘ elements to be consi-
dered contenders.

The Cleveland Indians have ' I
made a commitment to winning
but still are not ready to challenge ’

New York, Milwaukee or Detroit.
The tribe dished out a lot _of

money to improve their club, espe-ﬂag.

cially the pitching staff, whic
now consists of‘Larry Sorenson,
Rick Waits, John Denny, Bert Bly-
tleven and Len Barker.

Ray Searage, acquired from the
Mets, Rick Sutcliffe, Ed Whitson
and Silvio Martinez, as well as a
‘host of others, will work the
bullpen. . ’

The Cleveland infield will have

Mike Hargrove at first, Jack Per-.

conte at second, Toby Harrah at
short and probably Von Hayes at
third. Ron Hassey will catch.

In the outfield, the Indians have
“joltin’ ” Joe Charboneau, Miguel
Dilone and Rick Manning. V

Andre Thornton will probably’,

_ be the designated hitter.

Not surprisingly, the Toronto
Blue Jays had the worstirecord in
all of major league baseball last
season; this year they should do the
same.‘ _ ‘

_i)ave Stieb leads a weak pitching
staff, which includes Luis Leal,
Jerry Garvin, Nino Espiriosa, Jim
Clancy, Mark Bomback and Juan
Berenguer.

. The infield has John Mayberry
at first, Damasco Garcia at second,
Alfredo Criffin at shortand Aure-
lio Rodriquez. at third with Buck
Martinez catching.

In the outfield, the Blue Jays

have Lloyd Moseby and Otto Vel.ez_, - 

while the other spot remains open.”
Any of a number of players could
he the designated hitter.
The Jays. can take heart in the
fact that there is nowhere to move
but up. But for them, that seems

NOTHING TO DO TUESDAY
NIGHT? Then come party with
"Knuckles" LeMunyon and the rest of
the Phi-Men at 214 North Bellefield.
Proceeds benefit Arthritis Foundation.

SOME OF THE ADS for Delta Phi's
Charity Party have been really ainful
to read. But I'd rather read t e ads
than have Arthritis. Come to 214
North Bellefield and help out the
Arthritis Foundation.

KIRK'WEAVER SAYS, “Arthritis and
AC/DC are similar——they—re both
causes of pain!" We don't necessarily
agree, but come to 214 North Belle-
field and Delta Phi's Charity Party
Tuesday Night.

TUBS MCCULLOUGH SAYS, “Arthritis
is like eating cafeteria food-it's poin-

. Come meet‘ the philosophical‘ -;
tubs at Delta Phi's Charity Party Tue:"-if

day Night. Proceeds benefit Arthritis
Foundation.

WHAT'S MORE PAINFUL than read-
Inﬁ 108 pa es of Chaucer or being
in icted wit Arthritis? I don’t know,
but partying at Delta Phi Tuesday
night is a painless alternative.
BECKY, HERE'S HOPING YOU have a
real happy birthday. If you need any
help celebratin you know where to
look! Love, the isters and Pledges of
