Friendly faces greeted late registrants
at yesterday’s women’s conference.
During the opening brunch, women met
one another in an open, kind atmosphere.

Yesterday afternoon, Sisterhood:
Empowerment Now, a conference for
women, convened to give students the

' opportunity to discuss women’s issues on
 campus.

About 35 people attended, including
one man. _ .

The sole man at the event, Rob
Brown, a junior, said, “I just think this
stuff about feminism isn’t exclusive to
women.” I '

Dr. Sharon Johnson, vice provost and
dean of students, opened the conference
by welcoming the women and calling for
more female leadership on campus.

“We need to help each other along the
way,” Johnson said.

Johnson also addressed one of the
conference’s primary goals, the creation
of a women’s center.

Andrea DeChe1lis, public relations
director for the Campus Women’s
Organization, agreed with Johnson.

DeChel]is explained that Pitt used to
have a women’s center, but it dissolved
about ﬁve or six years ago.

She said, “For a college of this size
not to have a women’s center is a little
odd,” she said.

. DeChellis also explained that the sec.-

'ond goal of the conference was to bring
women from different organizations

together. ‘

Campus organizations including the
Asian Students Association, Black Action
Society, Rainbow Alliance, University
Democrats, Organization of Women in
Science, Women in Business, Students for
Reproductive Freedom and CW O cooper-
ated with SGB to organize the conference.

The diverse group organized nine

whether he should remain injail until a for-
mal trial is held. ‘ '

Uhrich ruled that Kaguyutan should be
held on charges of criminal homicide. The
defendant’s attorney insists police arrested
the wrong person.

The prosecution’s ﬁrst‘ witness, Pitt
junior Carissa Probst, testiﬁed that she met
the defendant in August of 1999 when both

According to the’ Probst and Pittsburgh
homicide detective Richard McDonald, the
couple’s April breakup led Kaguyutan to
vandalize Probst’s house, spy on her through
her bedroom window and eventually set ﬁre
to two Oakland buildings to prevent her
ﬁom taking residence with another man.

Matthew Kaguyutan is being held
in Allegheny County Jail on
charges of criminal homicide.

Probst’s testimony, which lasted for
more than an hour, recounted her summer
living at home with her parents. Probst said
she frequently received phone calls during

_ which the caller either hung up or breathed

heavily into the phone.
In July, Probst testiﬁed, she returned

Its too bad that kid had to die, I was trying to

get you. Maybe next time I ’ll just use a gun or just ,
slit your throat. Next time I won ’t mess up. If its the
last thing I do, you ’re gonna die, bitch. I know so
much about you. I know you ’re a waitress, and I do
know where you work — I think Squirrel Hill, right?
Believe me, I know a lot. Believe one more thing:
It’s for certain, when you least expect it, I am going

“I know where you work

will soon be forgotten, and so
will Josh and Mark,” she said,
recounting the message on the
wall.

Probst said that she had
no idea who “Mark” referred
to, but testiﬁed that “Josh” was
a man with whom she and

Jim Zanella anived dressed to impress.

Sure ﬂue dark sports coat, bright red
power tie and black shoes were ﬂashy. But
even more impressive was how Zanella
acquired the suit.

“Jim bought the whole thing in Italy,”

explained E. Maxine Bruhns, director of the I

Nationality Rooms Program. “The jacket,
the shirt, the pants, even the belt.

“And when he bought it he spoke only
Italian and he bargained the price down
completely in Italian,” Bruhns said.

Zanella was one of 21 graduate and
undergraduate students who sat down to
discuss their experiences traveling abroad
as part of the Summer Study Abroad pro-
gram sponsored by Pitt’s Nationality
Rooms and the Intercultural Exchange pro-
grams on Thursday night. A collection of
ﬁmd-raisers and scholarship donors served
as the audience.

‘The world is not encompassed in
Pittsburgh. The world is not encompassed
in the United States,” said Brulms, who

-moderated the panel discussion. “To really

understand [that concept] you have to leave

H’ these shores, and not as a tourist You have

to live ina culture and be immersed in it.”
To be eligible for the scholarship,
Bruhns said, students had to attend Pitt full

time and have a QPA of at least 275.

Students had to ﬁnd their own scholarship
program from hundreds kept on ﬁle in Pitt’s
study abroad ofﬁce, get the program
approved for academic credit, and then
defend the program in a series of essays and
an interview withthe‘ scholarship comrnit—
tee. '
To show off their immersion in the cul-
tures many’ recipients, besides Zanella,

wore native "dress of the country they visit— »

traveled to Mali tostudy the impact of new

a bargain on a ﬁne Italian suit, Zanella used
his time in Italy to study Italian language
and culture in Florence. “I visited some dis-
tant relatives I’d never met before, saw all
the museums, went to Rome and Pisa. I
even had mass with the pope.”

Triﬁn Roule, a graduate student who
travelled to the Balkanstates to study cor-
ruption in the government, had some less
friendly experiences.

“I was about to take a long train ride to
Lithuania and was warned passengers are
often robbed on the train and then thrown
overboard. I blew the warning off at the
time, but once I got on the train I stayed up
all night reading, just to be safe,” Roule
said. .'
Roule’s trip, used‘ to gain information
for his doctoral dissertation, was successﬁil.
Roule not only emerged alive from his jour-
ney, but was also contacted by the U.S. gov-
ernment upon his return_. They wanted to
use his ﬁndings on corruption in their deal-
ings with eastern Europe. 4

Maureen Cross Bolden, who chairs the
African Heritage committee, sat in the audi-
ence and was impressed by the experiences
of the students.

“It’s important that the trips bring a

trealness to things that can only otherwise be

read or imagined. Studying abroad gives a
chance for students to both know where
they’Ve come from and where they’re
going,” she said.

Cross Bolden’s hopes were not left
unrealized as each student ended the dis-
cussion with direct and truthful insights into
how their journeys have changed them.

“It’s opened my eyes to the rest of the
world,” said Thomas O’Donnell, a junior
who traveled to Ireland to study Gaelic
dialects. “I met a lot of wonderful people
and got to do a lot of wonderful things 
And the people — not just in Ireland, but in
the program here at Pitt —. they were all so
kind and generous. I’d just like to thank
them all.”

to networking.

The conference loosely required atten-
dance atone speciﬁc workshop, seductive-
ly entitled “Striptease.”

During the workshop, members
stripped away inner layers of bias as
opposed to outer layers of clothing.

Jo’ie Taylor, Andrea Lapin and
Margarita Sanniento facilitated the work-

‘ shop.

Taylor, SGB member, said that the
organizing groups asked everyone to attend
“Striptease” because the conference wanted
to address the differences among the

women attending the conference.

Participants could also choose from
eight other workshops.
“Mind, Body and Spirit,” facilitated by

Roxann Favors, focused on women’s health .

issues.

informed women of opportunities to be
active within and outside of Pitt.

police brutality as well as the correlation
between the crirninalizalion of women and
the access to education.

Women interested in discussing
healthy relationships participated in
“Building Healthy Relationships,” a forum

. facilitated by Desiree Williams.

“Blue Light Special,” facilitated by I
’ Stephanie Strazisar and Lisa Coxson,

Murrell and the Board of Chatharn College ‘

facilitated “Nefertiti to Wonder Woman,” a
workshop encouraging female leadership.

“Hands Off!” provided women with a .

forum to. discuss reproductive ‘freedom.
Amy Benson, DeChellis and Sally
Schlippert facilitated the workshop. ‘

Kimberly Dillon and Janet Syphan
both facilitated “The Old Girl’s Club,” an
informational session encouraging women
to network_to succeed in business. 0

The final workshop, “Nickels and
Dimes —— Only You Can Make the
Change,” occurred during the last work-
shop set This forum encouraged women to
share their views of a future women’s cen-
ter. .

Taylor said that the workshop was held
at the end of the day because the facilitators
wanted women to be exposed to the entire
day of workshops before they began think-
ing about what ﬂiey wanted in a women’s
center. ‘

Snyder spoke positively of the confer-
ence’s turnout.  .

“The atmosphere is great, it’s encour-
aging,” she said. A R

Snyder did feel, however, that the
women’s movement on campus needs to

spend more effort on recruitment. She said »

that the movement wants to attract women
who are not necessarily affiliated with an
organization.

Tomorrow night, the organizers of the
women’s conference will host a. women’s
dinner at 5:30 p.m. in the William Pitt

Preserving thepr

ERIN BRACHLOW
Staff Writer A

After working for half a year on the
Pitt Program Council’s time capsule pro-
ject, 50 years of suspense will be nothing
for Michelle Wydra.

The project was Wydra’s idea, and
she will complete the job when she
buries the capsule full of student contri-
butions later this year. Then she will
spend the next 50 years anxiously await-
ing its opening by the class of 2050. ’

Originally designed to tie into this
year’s fund-raising event run by
Institutional Advancement, the time cap-

sule project grew into an event on its
own. ‘

Contributions will be on display in
the Conney M. Kimbo art gallery in the
William Pitt Union through Oct. 28.

Wydra, arts director of Program
Council, volunteered $2,600 of her bud-
get to get the project started.

Choosing from the surprisingly large
number of businesses that specialize in
time capsules, she hired Time Capsules,
Inc. to help.

Wydra then contacted each student
organization on campus and encouraged
groups to contribute an item to the cap-
sule that would preserve the memory of
their club.

Some political groups want to pre-
serve their current beliefs, in case the
issues or parties change in the future. '

“I want the class of 2050 to know
that the Republican party has always
stood for what’s right,” said Nick
Havens, President of the Pitt College
Republicans. ‘

Groups have been very responsive
— 27 have made donations and others
still plan to give. Proving that Pitt has a
diverse student population with a wide
variety of interests, there were contribu-

-tions from religious and political organi-

zations, Greek organizations, the radio
station, the Dental Science Club, Friends
of Animals and others.

  You'd better

esent for Pitt posterity

The items ranged from a sorority T-
shirt signed by its members to photo
albums and scrapbooks of groups’ activ-
ities. The Dental Science Club even con-
tributed a hardened impression of some-
one’s-teeth.

“I think [in 50 years] they will real-
ize there’s a history they can be proud
of,” Wydra said, “and a great tradition of
student involvement and diversity.”

After all the items are collected,
Time Capsules, Inc. will close the metal
box and take all the oxygen out, replac-
ing it with ‘argon and other chemicals to
preserve the contents. T

In an effort to make the burial spot

of the capsule as meaningful as the cap- /,

sule itself, Wydra chose to put it inside
the long—anticipated Panther statue,
scheduled to sit on the William Pitt

Union lawn when it returns from Italy ‘

later this year.
One of the stones will be removed to

' house to capsule until 2050. Expected to

return early this spring, the statue will be
accompanied by a plaque explaining the
project, sparking the interest of each Pitt
class until it is opened.

“I want to put my social security
number in the capsule too, so they can
trace me when I’m 70 years old and I can
see the opening,” Wydra said.’

With the technology of 2000, and
news regarding CDs, digital photographs
and minority, abortion and vegetarian
issues, the class of 2050 may see many
changes. A‘

“I think they will be amused and
confused,” Wydra said. “Who knows
what they will have in 50 years?”

She hopes that the project’s purpose
will not be lost during the 50 years the

capsule remains buried. She wants the ,

project to show students that they should
be proud of the University.

“One thing I think is lacking from
this campus is a sense of history,”'she
said. “With this project, we can celebrate
what we’ve already achieved, and
although the groups and issues may

change, the Pitt tradition will continue.” V

Haunts in the ‘Burgh  

BRAD CUPRIK A
Contributing Editor

Thomas Edison made a trip to Pittsburgh in the 1920s to

visit a house that was supposedly haunted. The visit changed '

Edison’s mind on matter and energy.

“There are certain things we cannot explain, and all
energy cannot be accounted for,” Edison said when he left
1129 Ridge St. on the city’s North Side. “We-should leave it
alone.” - ' i r
The story of Edison’s trip, as well as many other ghost
stories of Pittsburgh, was told by tour guide Woody
Curmingham on board the Trolley of Terror, sponsored by
Molly’s Trolleys. A

g » The trolley tours the “haunted” spots of the city, includ— '

ing stops in the North Side, Oakland and the South Side.

Thursday’s tour, however, was for a Pitt Freshmen
Studies class.

“When it’s your own backyard, it tends to be a little
more  Curmingharn said.

The tour started with the Cathedral of Learning, and the
supposedly haunted Early American Nationality Room on
the third and fourth ﬂoors of the building.

The room, complete with a hidden second ﬂoor, is said
to be haunted by early  ‘

‘ Curmingham said. “There was also the imprint ofahead in

the pillow. _ V '

During the summer, Probst decided to
move to an apartment with Pitt student Jesse
Vanko, a mutual friend of Probst and
Kaguyutan. She and Vanko signed a lease
and were slated to move into an apartment at
317 North Craig St at the end of August.
The two never moved into the apart-
ment, Probst testiﬁed, becausean Aug. 19

police, Kaguyutan, who lived in the building -

at the time, later admitted to setting the ﬁre to
prevent Probst from moving into the apart-
ment with Vanko. - ' ‘
Probst and Vanko were able to ﬁnd
another apartment, and in spite of
Kaguyutan’s objections, moved in together

“[Kaguyutan] hoped it’ wouldn’t form a-

‘ Probst said she saw Kaguyutan ﬁe-
quently during the ﬁrst few weeks of
September. The two. shared classes, and con-
tinued a— friendship outside‘ of school.
However, according to Probst, that friend-
ship became increasingly strained through
the month. A ' A
Probst testiﬁed that on one evening, she
and Kaguyutan ingested the drug common-
ly known as ecstasy before patronizing
numerous clubs in Pittsburgh. After the two

retumed to her apartment, Probst received a a

phone call ﬁom a male friend, whom she
invited to join them.
After the friend arrived, Probst told

Kaguyutan that she needed to talk privately '

with the man and left Kaguyutan alone in the
living room while she and the visitor went to
her bedroom. Probst testiﬁed that while she

and the friend were talking, she looked out.-

side and saw Kaguyutan on the ,building’s
roof peering into her window.

“I told him to get out, and never speak
to me again,” she said I . -
But Kaguyutan persisted, and the two
continued to see each other on friendly terms
in the weeks that followed ' . 1
“He always said that he loved me, that
he wanted to get back together,” Probst said.
On the morning‘ of Sept 29, Probst
woke up coughing. “I opened my eyes, and
there was smoke coming through my bed-
room wall,” she said
According to Probst, her living room
was engulfed in ﬂames, preventing escape
through the front door. She and Vanko

climbed out a back window and onto the

roof of the building. _

Probst testiﬁed that she then ran to the
front of the building and repeatedly rang the
doorbell to the third ﬂoor apartment. She

said that two men who she knew only in
passing lived on the ﬂoor, and she didn’t

know if they had escaped tl1e_ building.

began to fall ﬁom above. One of those men,

death threat in the mail. She read the

read. “If it’s the last thing I do, you’re going

ment, removed a large wax candle from the
living room, lit the candle on ﬁre, and placed

» it on the side of the couch closest to the door.

McDonald ‘testiﬁed that Kaguyutan told

‘him he watched the ﬁre ignite until it was

“going pretty good.” According to the detec-

Feminism not limited to women

Yesterday, the Student
Government Board, as well as

several other - organizations,
hosted Sisterhood:
Empowerment Now, a confer--
ence aimed: at discussing

women’s issues on campus.’ The
brainchild of SGB President
Joan Snyder was attended by 34
women and one man.

After the referendum affair,
when SGB may have earned
itself a bad image, Snyder
should be praised for putting the
conference on as she mostly
coordinated it without the help

. of most‘ of the" board (especially

the male members).

The lone male who ‘attended,
junior Rob Brown, explained, “I
just think this stuff about femi-
nism isn’t exclusive to women.”
We should praise _Brown for
attending this conference for
valid reasons and not being
there just to get 34 phone num-
bers. He is exactly right —
equal rights for women is not
just a women’s issue, just as
racial equality is not just an
issue for minorities.

In fact, many of the early
feminists were men; for exam-
ple, William Lloyd Garrison,
known for his activities against
slavery, also proudly referred to

«himself as a feminist and cam-

paigned as hard for women’s
rights as he did for slavery’s
abolition. Most likely he also
faced the same criticism that he
was a “traitor to his race and/or
gender” that many modern-day
white male advocates of racial
and gender equality face.

At last week’s SGB meeting,
board member Jo’ie Taylor sug-

gested that the male board mem-

bers abstain from voting on the
allocation for this conference as
she believed that men should
have no say concerning alloca-
tions for a women’s conference.
While her viewpoint on this is
understandable, it was not nec-
essarily the best one as males
should — and do — have a say
in equal rights. V

Although this conference
was a step in the right direction,
more women — and men —
should have attended it. The
next time a conference such as
this one is held, the organizers
should make an effort to attract
both women and men. Not all
men are the selfish pigs that
many consider them to be; many
do care about women’s rights
and women’s issues.

After all, everyone, no mat-
ter what race or gender, has an
equal stake in the debate over
equal rights.

A new way to spend Friday nights

Last year, I found a unique and interesting
way to laugh, smile and have an enjoyable time
on a Friday night, something that I especially
needed after having one of those typically
stressful weeks that most of us encounter.

My experience with Friday Night Irnprovs
started when I met this guy, Chris, on a bus ride
home from the mall on a Friday night. Chris
asked me ifl had any plans, so I told him about
the usual party and then he told me about

how much fun it was and suggest-
ing that I check it out sometime.
Comedy for only $2 sounded like a
neat idea to me and I had always
wanted to check out comic irnprov.
Now, I had my chance. »

So, the next Friday night rolled around and
a friend and I found ourselves heading down to
the basement of the Cathedral of Learning,
which was an interesting hideaway that I never
knew existed. We arrived exactly at 11 p.m.
and ended up sitting on the ﬂoor because the
place was packed — the theater area was cer-
tainly not spacious enough for this crowd.

I had never realized‘ how big of a thing this
actually was, as people were laughing and hav-
ing a good time before it even began!

The activities started with the host coming
out and telling the audience the basic rules of
Friday Night Irnprov. These rules included
having a good time and not booing any per-
formers.

From then on, it was hilarious. A person
would come out and explain the next game that
was going to be played. Then, members of the
audience volunteered to play. The games were
all different; varying from acting out a’ story to
playing musical and guessing games. AH of
them were played from a comical standpoint
—— no parts were actually serious. The per-
formers thought of their own themes and story
ideas and accepted audience members ideas as
well, using them to start each game. It was
mainly up to the performers to keep the stories
and ideas going. .

A favorite game of mine was one in which
a famous fairy tale was mixed up. The per-

MEGAN

HARRISON

S'lI\FI" VVRl'l‘l{R

 

formers made Snow White extremely funny as
they changed aspects of it such as the genre,
the attitudes of the characters and its setting in
time.

Another game that amused me was the
dating game. In this game, one male and three
females volunteered to participate, but the guy
was not allowed to see what the girls looked
like until the end when he picked one. Each girl
was assigned a silly occupation to talk about
when trying to Win over the bach-
elor. What made it all the more
enjoyable was that the couple in
the end had to actually go out on
a date and tell about it at the next
Friday!

In addition to the games, there is also a
part called Showcase, where a person or group
(who signed up in advance) puts on a perfor-
mance. That night, a local group of musicians
was featured. Previous showcases included a
tap dancer, poetry readings, and stand-up
comedians. _

I was extremely impressed at the level of
talent on the parts of the people who performed
— they were funny and truly got into what
they were doing. Being a fairly shy person, I
admired how they could just get up in front of
a large group of people and "perform impro-
vised comedy. It amazes me how they make up
hilarious ideas right there on the spot, one story
after another. ’

Chris was one of the people who per-
formed and he told me that it feels really great
when you are up there in front of everyone.
Although I am sure that this is true, I can’t see
myself doing that —— I’d rather just watch.

I found myself laughing more in those two
hours that I had all week. When the evening
ended, I knew that I would be back sometime
and my friend deﬁnitely agreed. Irnprov is a
good change from the Friday night party scene
as it gives people the chance to get together and
laugh, something that we don’t see happening
enough.

Megan Harrison hopes to see everyone in the
basement of the Cathedral this Friday night.

Youth Vote 2000 deservesa closer look

With Nov. 7 getting closer, more
people are starting to pay attention
to the presidential election. One
organization that is getting a lot of
coverage is Youth Vote 2000, which
claims to be a nonpartisan coalition
of national organizations committed
to encouraging civic participation
and promoting a better understand-
ing of public policy issues among
young people in the United States.

I was unaware of the organiza-
tion until they started calling for the
presidential candidates and the
Commission on Presidential Debates
to hold a youth debate centered on
questions asked by 18 to 30 year
olds. The mission of Youth Vote
2000 sounds very attractive: Get an
apolitical generation involved in the
political process. However, any
organization can be best defined by
its members.

Among the members of Youth
Vote 2000 are People for the
American Way, the National Gay
and Lesbian. Task Force, Zero

Population Growth, the U.S. Student
Association (an organization found-
ed by socialists that most of you, as
students of Pitt, unknowingly fund),

These leftist organizations have
either officially supported Al Gore
or have endorsed liber-
al Democratic candi- NICK
dates in the past. None
of them have endors_ed
Gov. George W. Bush.

The ideology
espoused by this consortium of radi-
cal leftist organizations is out of
synch with the political beliefs of
most 18 to 30 year olds. After view-
ing this list of organizations that
make up Youth Vote 2000, one
would have to be extremely ignorant
to believe this organization is non-
partisan.

Youth Vote 2000 is closely affil-
iated with MTV’s Rock the Vote, an
organization that was founded by
members of the recording industry

in response to a wave of attacks on

freedom of speech and artistic
expression. I haven’t heard any sen-
sible young person say artistic
expression is the most pressing con-

ear.’  e.ee'eeeeee>‘:e“eeee2aa."ee"ee;e ‘ereeeasereeeeaa: we «=9 we

cern facing our generation.

In 1999 Hillary Clinton was hon-
ored with the first Rock the Nation
Award for her dedication and com-
mitment to young people and com-
munities around the world. Give me
a break — I can’t think of one thing
she has done toiimprove the
lives of young people and
communities around the
world. And wasn’t this orga-
nization supposed to be non-
partisan? I

There is another interesting link
between Rock the Vote and Youth
Vote 2000: Julia Cohen. Previously
Cohe_n served as vice president of
Rock the Vote and is currently the
executive director and spokeswoman

for Youth Vote 2000. After a little

research I found’ that Cohen was pre-

fviously a registered lobbyist for the

Planned Parenthood Federation of
America. Planned Parenthood
relentlessly lobbies Congress to
appropriate taxpayer money to fund
abortion on demand. Its political
arm, Planned Parenthood Action
Fund, is a major contributor to
Democratic candidates.

This organization uses its web

_

 

  

page, www.p1annedparenthood-
votes.com, as an attack tool against
Bush and the Republican National
Committee. In fact their president
states, “I’m Gloria Feldt, president
of the Planned Parenthood Action
Fund, and we are here today to

announce a national ad campaign to .

educate voters about Gov. George

W. Bush’s positions on family plan-_

ning issues. Planned Parenthood
Action Fund is new to presidential
politics, but the time has come for
Planned Parenthood to join the bat-
tle.”

Would Cohen and her cronies
deem this organization as nonparti-
san? It becomes even more evident
that the people involved in Youth
Vote 2000 have a strong partisan
agenda th_at,includes getting Al Gore
elected president of the United
States. Youth Vote 2000 is another
deceptive attempt by the far left to
further its agenda under the guise. of
a nonpartisan organization.

Nick Havens thinks young people
need to start questioning the agen-
das of supposedly noun-biased and
nonpartisan political organigations,

-requires the use of a motor vehicle

If an alcohol violation is accompanied by other
offenses (e.g. assaulting an officer, DUI with
vehicular homicide), you may be convicted of a
felony, which bars you from obtaining professional
licenses or certifications.

Over 98% of Fortune 500 and 200 REQUIRE pre-

Over 85% of employers conduct random drug and
alcohol testing of their employees. Positive tests
can lead to treatment at the employee’s expense
and even termination of employment.

Panthers move to 5-1 with 42-26 win over Boston College

BRAD CUPRIK

Assistant Sports Editor

One of the only men smaller
than Pitt football head coach Walt
Harris had something of importance
at Saturday’s game against Boston
College.

A member of the Pitt band had a
piece of paper that Harris liked. It
was the definition of pride and" it
read, “Overwhelming desire to be
the best and doing it right the first
time.”

The Panthers may not be the
best team in the nation, but an
‘offensive outburst gave them a 42-

'26 win over the Eagles, equaling

last year’s win total of five.

It was the Panthers’ first win
over BC in four years, their last was
a 20-13 win in 1996 on a Thursday
night. -

Quarterback John Turman,
named the starter for the rest of the
season earlier in the week, respond-
ed to the announcement by throwing
for a career-high five touchdowns.

Running back Kevan Barlow
and wide receiver Antonio Bryant
could have won “best supporting
player” awards with career-highs of
209 yards rushing and 222 yards
receiving, respectively.

Barlow and Bryant each scored

two touchdowns, and sparked the
Panthers to a season-high 584 yards
of offense.

“I want to thank my football
players for bringing it and getting
the job done,” Harris said.

After both teams punted on their

first drives, BC quarterback Tim»

Hasselbeck was intercepted by
Shawn Robinson at the Eagles’ 45-
yard line. _

Turman found Bryant for a 15-
yard completion and after an incom-
plete pass and three short runs, it
was tight end Kris Wilson that
caught his first collegiate pass, a
23-yard scoring strike from
Turman.

“We think Kris is a real good
talent,” Harris said. ‘_‘W_e made a
commitment to get him the ball.”

On the next drive, Robinson“

John "lhrman smiles after a Pitt touchdown in Saturday’s victory.

Turman-ator  

Pitt quarterbacksets career

MARIO MACHI
Sports Editor

’ The relief was evident on John
Turman’s face.

Walking into the postgame news
conference after Pitt’s ‘42-26 victory
over ’' Boston College, Turman
looked relaxed and confident as he

_ sat before reporters to answer ques-

tions about the game, the first since

‘ Pitt head coach Walt Harrisfnamed

‘him theundisputed No. 1 quarter-
back for the first time in two years.

And when the first question was
asked about the advantages of being
named to the top spot by Harris,
Turman gave media members‘ a
good example.

“I felt good out there,” Turman
said. “Especially when I fumbled,
because I knew I’d get a chance‘ to
go back in.” "

Turman was referring to a play
in the second quarter when he fum-
bled the exchange from -center Jeff
McCurley, with Curtis . Bolden
recovering for Boston College. The
recovery led to a 5-yard touchdown
run by Cedric Washington which

highwith five touchdown passes  
  in 42-26 win over Bostoncollege

« tied the score, 7-7.

“I’ve been my own worst critic
with the quarterbacks, but John had
a pretty special day today,’,’ Harris
said. _ I - ‘

On the afternoon, Turman com-
pleted 16 of 29 passes for 332 yards
and set a career-high with five
touchdown passes, including three
in the first half. B

“We. were just on, today,”
Turman said of the Pitt offense. '

His main target was sophomore
wide out Antonio Bryant, who fin-

ished with eight‘. catches for 222_

yards. After the game, Bryant said
that the team didn’t care who the
starting quarterback was, although
he thinks it affected Turman person-
ally. ’

“I think it helps the individual,”  

Bryant said of having a permanent

starter at "quarterback." “Today, it,

obviously helped the quarterback

more. John made some pretty good

reads.” A
Turman’s five touchdown passes

were the most by a Pitt quarterback. A

since Pete Gonzalez set the school-

Turman, page 20

Panthers’ win had many subplots involved

If you’re a Pitt fan and Walt Harris wasn’t your-

hero before Saturday’s game against Boston College,
then he should be now. Harris’ decision to make John
Turman his starter for the remainder of the season
paid off in a big way Saturday as
Turman threw for a career-high five
touchdown passes in Pitt’s 42-26 vic-
tory.

However, Turman wasn’t the only
story of Saturday’s game. Here are some .
other observations from the press box at "7
Three Rivers Stadium: "'

0 Where has Kevan Barlow been for the
past few weeks? The Barlow of old
returned Saturday, running for 209
yards on 25 carries after being 
benched in the loss to Syracuse on ;I
Oct. 7. A healthy and tu_mover—free
Barlow is a key to the success of this
Pitt team.

- The Pitt offense was outstanding on Saturday.
Where was the offenseon Oct. 7 when Pitt lost to
Syracuse? Was it gambled away in the casinos of
Niagara Falls or something?

- Doesn’t Pitt’s loss to Syracuse look a lot better

now that Virginia Tech only won by eight points at

  
   
  
   
  
   
   
 

the Carrier Dome Saturday night? According to my

calculations, since Pitt lost by seven at the dome and .

VT won by 8, the Panthers will only lose to the
Hokies by 15 points. ‘

0 At the beginning of the season, I wrote a col-
urrm in this publication that said if Antonio

would be forgetting about Latef Grim by the
end of the season. Well, Bryant had over 200

if I 7'  yards receiving Saturday while Grim had just

one catch for 4 yards. You can praise me later.
But I think that Bryant’s performance this
weekend was a setup. It was a secret plan by
Harris and the rest of the coaching staff to get
ready for Virginia Tech this weekend. Bryant
  had 215 yards against the Hokies last year,
' 3 so they will certainly be keying on him this
year. So that sets up the first monster game
of the season from Grim, right? Just wait

and see.

- Poor David Priestley. The man who. threw for
over 400 yards against Virginia Tech last season will
be relegated to the sidelines this weekend in
Blacksburg, Va. With Tumian getting the start and
Rod Rutherford running the option. successfully,
Priestley isthe odd man out. But with the game he

had against the Hokies last year, I think VT head

. . . . . . » . , . . . - ~ . . . . . . . . ' . ' . ' r ' . ' . “ . '

Bryant played up to his potential, Pitt fans '

coach Frank Beamer might be glad he isn’t facing
Priestley again.

0 The final play of Saturday’s game wasn’t-

noticed by many of the fans still left in the stadium,
but it was a 5-yard run by freshman fullback Dustin
Picciotti. '

Picciotti, the highly decorated recruit from
Central Bucks West High School in Doylestown, Pa.,
has been playing only on the kickoff coverage team
thus far this season. But when the Panthers were one
play away fromwrapping up the victory against BC,
Harris sent in Picciotti to get the first carry of his
career. ,

By playing Picciotti, even if only on kickoff cov-
erage teams, Harris has sent a message to recruits
that Pitt is the place to be. He guaranteed Picciotti
that he would not redshirt him, and he is staying true

to his word. And although Lousaka Polite has played P

excellent football thus far this season,'Picciotti can
and will be a key contributor down the stretch for
Pitt.

and if Pitt loses its remaining ﬁve games, he will be
dropping out of school, along with-assistant sports
editor Brad Cuprik and editor in chief Rehan Nasir;

Uconn and St. John’s fall victim to Pitt volleyball team

FRAN AIELLO
Staff Writer

Pitt volleyball head coach Chris
Beerman said that digging, blocking
and getting the balls into the other
team’s side of the court were major
keys to the Victories posted against
Connecticut on Friday night and
against St. John’s Sunday afternoon.
Pitt began the weekend hoping to
improve on their 2-2 record and
ended up 4-2 in the Big East.

“We’ve developed into a really
good blocking team,” Beerman said.
“We worked a lot on that in practice.”

Beerman noticed a change in the
team’s demeanor and development
into a defensive force in the Big East
which he had been hoping to develop
in practice. 1

Pitt vs. Connecticut

The Huskies played a very defen-
sive-oriented Panthers team on Friday
night. Despite a couple of close
games and numerous side outs, the
match went to Pitt in three games.
The scores of the games were 15-7,
15-13 and 15-13.

Pitt held the lead throughout the
first game. The biggest rally came off
of the serving of Marcia Thiesen, who
got seven points on her first trip back

'1 to serve. Jen Nickels’ rejections’ and

 

DAVE MCANALIJPHOTO EDITOR

Stacy Renick delivers a kill against Connecticut in the Pitt victory.

Stacy Renick’s kills fed the rally as a
surprised Connecticut burned a time-
out after four points and then allowed
three more before finally getting a
side-out. It was too late for the
Huskies because by then the Panthers
led the game 9-1. The game ended
with a Wendy Hatlestad kill.

“Wendy had a big game offen-
sively,” Beerman said.

In game two Pitt and Connecticut
fought for the lead early on. The score
remained within two points until the
Huskies jumped ahead with Melissa
Wooley serving up four points before
Thiesen got a kill. Pitt rallied behind
a Renick kill and a Nickels kill and
block, all served up by Thiesen,
bringing the score to 7-10.

After another couple of points
served up by Wooley, a Nickels kill
stopped the ruriat 7-12.

Nickels served up a Renick/Haff
block and a Renick solo block to nar-
row the margin to 9-12.

Norris served for another three
points to tie the game 12-12, and
Renick contributed ‘another point

before Lisa Riggle served a Nickels

block andkill to finish the comeback
in game two. .

. The Panthers again had their
hands full with the Huskies in a close
game three. Despite an early lead Pitt

have a good game, as his second
punt traveled just 17 yards, and BC
took over at the Pitt 37. '

Boston College’s offense could
not get much going and settled for a
37-yard field goal by Mike Sutphin
at the beginning of the second quar-
ter for a 10-7 lead.

The Panthers struck back on
their next drive, going 70 yards in
12 plays, capped off by a touch-
down pass from Turman to tight end
Brennan Carroll.

“When we had to respond, we
responded,” Harris said. .

Barlow ran five times on the
drive for 34 yards, and got help
from redshirt freshman quarterback
Rod Rutherford,.who ran the option
offense. '

FROM PAGE 12

With the Panthers up 14-10, the

defense held and the offensescored
again, going 61 yards in just five
plays.

On a third-and-16. from the BC
41, Turman lofted» a pass to the end
zone that Bryant was able to haul in

. over the head of Eagles defensive

back Willie Poole for another Pitt
touchdown. .

Right before the end of the first
half, Sutphin added another field

goal, from 43 yards, to cut the Pitt

lead to 21-13. It was Sutphin’s
longest of the season and of his
career. _ « '

Turman’s three first—ha1f touch-
downs were enough to take the
pressure off the senior.

“It felt good out there,” Turman

said. “The fumble was just a stupid
play on my part.”
. “I was a little more relaxed, and
I think that enabled me to attack the
Boston College zone with my pass-
es,” Turman said.

Pitt started the second half with

‘ the ball, but punted away after three

plays. .
BC moved the ball with preci-

‘I sion passing after its running game

stalled, but Sutphin missed his first

attempt after 10 consecutive suc-'

cessful ones from 37 yards out.

Pitt kicker Nick Lotz, who had
missed two field goals and an extra
point at Syracuse two weeks ago,
missed a 31-yard field goal attempt
on the ensuing drive.

The Panthers got the ball back

after a BC punt, and Turman com-.
pleted passes of 27 yards to Bryant
and 28 yards to Wilson, before find-
ing Barlow on a screen pass.
Barlow bulled his way into the
BC end zone from 11 yards out, and
Pitt’s lead was increased to 28-13.

As it seems with every Pitt‘

game, the Panthers let the opposi-
tion back into the game, and it was
Robinson, earlier the hero with two
interceptions, who found himself to
blame.

On a third-and—8 from the 23-
yard line, Hasselbeck threw a ball
to the left sideline.

Robinson had good coverage on
BC wide receiver Dedrick DeWalt,

but turned the wrong way, and _

DeWalt pulled the ball down.

It appeared that Robinson didn’t I

even make an attempt to tackle
DeWa1t, as he scampered 77 yards
for the Eagles’ touchdown.

‘‘I didn’t know the ball was
thrown my. way,” Robinson said.
“That’s why I didn’t try to tackle
him.”

Pitt responded again, however,
when Turman and Bryant hooked up
for a 67-yard scoring pass, giving
Turman his fifth touchdown of the
day. A -
“That’s how it is when you
practice hard,” Bryant said.

The Eagles came‘ right back
again and Hasselbeck completed a
9-yard screen pass to Washington
for a touchdown.

The two-point conversion, how-
ever, was intercepted by Pitt line-
backer Amir Purifoy, and Pitt’slead

stood at 35-26.

. With the Panthers trying to run
down the fourth—quarter clock,

Barlow found a hole on the left side

and then found a lot more room as
he ran 45 yards for the sixth Panther
touchdown of the day, finishing the
game at 42-26. '

“We have some records here
today, but the only one that is
important to our football team is
that we got,our fifth win,” Harris
said. -

The Panthers get their toughest
test of theseason to date when they
travel to Blacksburg, Va., for a 3:300

p.m. game Saturday against the No. ._

2 team in the nation, Virginia Tech.
“It should be a nice, wholesome
gameon grass,” Bryant said. ‘‘I like

' that environment.”

trailed 6-10 before coming back to tie
at 13-13 with Riggle serving for three
T hiesen kills. Nickels and Norris con-
tributed points as well as some explo-
sive Thiesen, Hatlestad, Renick and
Heather Haff plays. The match ended
when Nickels served for a Norris tip
and then an ace to finish game three.

“It was a very tough match we
just played well,” Beerman said. “The
difference in this match would be the
defensive intensity.”

Defensively the team tallied 58
digs. Thiesen had 13, Haff had 11 and
both Norris and Renick had 9. Nickels
and Riggle also both chipped in for
seven and six digs respectively. The
Panthers also racked up five solo

blocks and 12 block assists.

Pitt vs. St. John’s

In the game against St. John’s
Sunday the defensive domination
continued as Pitt swept the Red Storm
in three games. The scores of the
match were 15-4, 15-7 and 15-8.

The team, led by Renick and
Thiesen, had 46 digs, two solo blocks
(both from Haff) and 16 block assists
defensively.

“Renick continues to be a leader
and keeps coming through,” Beerman
said. “Thiesen really stood out, great
weekend for her.”

Renick and Thiesen posted 15 and
12 kills respectively as the Panthers
dominated St. J_ohn’s.

“I thought the beginning of each
game and how we came out [was crit-

ical],” Beerman said. “We really
came out fast and got 5-1, 6-1
games.”

Game one of the match started
with Pitt facing a 0-1 deficit but the
team built an offensive attack slowly
as the team rejected six different
serves from St. John’s and pieced the
lead together one point at a time.

With a 6-1 lead off of Haff blocks

and Hatlestad’ kills, as well .as side-

outs from Thiesen and Nickels, the
team allowed two points from Robyn
Kuraski serves. They then went back
to finish the game with more kills
from Haff, Thiesen and Renick.
Game two went to Pitt as the team
maintained a lead throughout. Pitt
jumped to a 3-0 lead with an ace from
Renick and a couple more points from
her serves. The game ended with a

Norris serve and a Hatlestad kill.

iIn game three Pitt came back
from an initial 1-5 deficit with
Nickels serving for four consecutive
points. From the 5-5 mark the
Panthers jumped to 12-5 with more

stiﬂing defense and slow lead build- V

ing. Pitt won -the game and match on
a Haff block to bring the Panthers to
their current 4-2 record in the Big
East. , A A

“We have the ability to finish as

record by throwing for seven touch-
downs against Rutgers in 1997.

One factor that ‘helped Turman’s
transition to the full-time starting
quarterback was the Pitt running
game.

The running game centered on
the re-emergence of Kevan Barlow,
who was benched in the loss‘ to

Syracuse on Oct. 7 after fumbling‘ I

for the fifth time in a four-game
span.

Barlow came back with a
vengeance against BC, rushing for
209 yards on 25 carries, while
adding one rushing touchdown and
one receiving touchdown.

“[The running game] takes a ton
of pressure off of the passing
game,” Turman said. “That makes
my job a lot easier.”

Another thing that made
Turman’s job easier was the play of
the Pitt tight ends. ’

In the first five games, Pitt’s
tight ends had two catches, both by
Brennan Carroll. By the end of the
first half‘ of Saturday’s game, Pitt’s
tight ends ‘had two touchdown

' catches.

Kris Wilson, a redshirt fresh-

man, caught a 23-yard touchdown ~

pass from Turman in the first quar-
ter to put Pitt up 7-0, and Carroll

was on the receiving end of a 3-yard V

scoring play in the second quarter

that gave Pitt the lead for good at I

14-10.
“The tight ends were a big fac-

' tor [in my success],” Turman said.

“We worked on getting them; the
ball in practice and it carried over
to the game.” ,

With a 200-yard receiver and a
200-yard rusher, it appears that
Harris made the right decision when
choosing a starting quarterback and
putting the Pitt offense in the right
hands — John Turman’s.
