Pitt’s Board of Trustees’ Property and
Facilities Committee approved a total

construction and renovation projects
at its meeting Monday.

The committee approved $59
million for a new residence hall to be
built on the corner ofFifth Avenue and
University Place, according to a press
release from the University. '

The néw"10-story freshman dorm
will hold 559 beds. The first ﬂoor will
consist of commercial retail space and
the second ﬂoorwill house aWellness
Center comprised of Pitt’s Student
Healthservice andthe Counseling Cen-
ter. Construction onthe new dormhas
already begun at the former site of the
University Place office building.

The money for the project will
come from auxiliary reserves and
auxiliary debt. Auxiliary revenue and

serve as the source for the annual op-

‘ erating costs, which is expected to be

$4.6 million. The dorm is expected to
have an armual gross income of $4.6
million.

The committee also approved
construction of a ﬁve—story addition
to Parran and Crabtree halls at a cost
of $41.3 million. The money will go
toward the relocation and expansion
of Graduate School of Public Health
research facilities that are currently
dispersed throughout the two halls.
The project’s ﬁmdingwill come from
commonwealth ﬁmds and reserved
funding.

Pitt changes language requirement

Tiffany Grossi
For The Pitt News

' At the beginning of each French

class, Pitt professor Andrea_]ons-
son poses a question to her stu-
dents to open up discussion.

' “Quelle est votre nourriture
préfér_ée?” she said. It translates
to, “What’s your favorite food?”

Jonsson has taught beginner
and advanced French and French
literature courses at Pitt for the
past three years. She said her class-
es usually consist of an eclectic mix

of ability levels, but most of her A

students have some sort of experi-
ence speaking the language.

“We never come across a com-
plete beginner. I have incoming
freshmen who ‘test out of begin-
ning French and register into

I French literature,” ‘she said.

With a modiﬁed second-lan-
guage requirement to be issued

by Pitt’s School of Arts & Sciences
for fall 2012, more students might
need to enroll in one of _]onsson’s
classes. '

Starting with incoming fresh-
men next year, students will be
expected to earn a grade of a B
or better in three years of high
school language classesto be ex-
empt from Pitt’s second-language

» requirement. Currently, students

only need to earn a C or better in

'three years of high’ school classes

to receive exemption.

John Twyning, the associate
dean for undergraduate studies,
said the quality of language ac-
quisition is important to Pitt, and
the new requirement reﬂects the
University’s commitment to gradu-
ating students with knowledge of a
second language. He is a member
of the Arts and Sciences Council
that made the decision to change
the requirement. A I

“Language skills are an impor-

tant component of a liberal arts
education, and they help us un-
derstand ourselves and our place
inthe world,” he said.

Twyning said the growing
global economy makes the com-
prehension of another language a
matter of national, economic and
educational importance.

As for transfer credits from
other universities, Twyning said
the exemption rule will remain the
same. A student will be exempt
from taking classes at Pitt if they
come in with two or more terms of
university—level instruction with a
grade of C or better. .

Students who come in with no
high school credit orwho do 'not
meet the grade requirement for
high school languages must take
two levels of a language at Pitt. The
University provides over 30 lan-
guage options ranging from Irish
Gaelic and Arabic to Chinese and
French. ’

In addition to its content,
the requirement’s name has also
changed. Instead of “foreign lan-
guage,” the Arts & Sciences Council
has instated the term “second lan-
guage” to more accurately address
the difference between English and
other languages. A ’

Jonsson said she isn’t famil-
iarwith the difference between
a second and a foreign language,
but overall she’s happy the grade
content of the requirement has
changed.

“It’s‘ easy to get a B as long as
you put in theheffort and show up
to class,” she said.. .

Elena Giel, a junior ﬁnance ma-
jor with an Italian minor, said she
is also pleased with the change in
the second-language requirement
at Pitt. * _

“I feel that it’s a good thing,
because from a student who has
studied abroad, I realize how

Voter registration for Nov. 8 elections ends next Week

Michael Ringling
Staﬂ" Writer

With the voter registration deadline
one week away, Pitt political groups
have taken to campus to urge their
unregistered peers to get their ap-
plications in before the Oct. 11 Penn-
sylvania due date.

Matt Vermeire, the president of
the Pitt College Republicans, stressed
the importance of casting a vote in
local elections. They’re the elections,
he said, that often kick start national
politicians’ careers. _

9 “Local elections are where it mat—
ters,” he said. “When you have 500
people voting, your vote statistically
counts for more. The people you elect
in the local office are the ones who
will lead you nationally.”

But, though students register to
 Oakland has two of the largest
voﬁjggdismas in the city —— they typ-
 vote. In non-presidential
el’_"_:  turnout is usually less than
20p;’ercent, and sometimes less than
onelpercent among students.

Where to register

Municipal election day is on Nov.
8 this year. Students applying for an
absentee ballot must apply by Nov.
1 and have their votes submitted by
Nov. 4.

To register online, visit votespa.
com to access a link to applications
under the “applications and forms”
side bar.

Students can also ﬁnd application

forms at any government agency,
such as Army recruitment centers.
On campus, both the Pitt College
Democrats and the Pitt College Re-

publicans will distribute voter reg-

istration forms during their tabling
times in Towers’ lobby throughout
the week.

Student response to the upcoming
elections is mixed.

important a language is. And
it’s something we as American
students as a whole are lacking,”
she said. I ,

Although it’s a step in the right
direction, Giel said that she be-
lieves the real change must start
at a younger age and that studies
have repeatedly shown that a per-

‘ son has a greater capacity to learn

and retain a language in primary
or elementary school.

A study conducted by College
Board in 2004, College-Bound Se-
niors: A Proﬁle of SAT Test Takers,
found that students with four or

major said he’s currently registered
to vote in his hometown of Connells-
ville, Pa. He will not register to vote
in Pittsburgh because of a tax issue
on his home ballot that he will ﬁle an
absentee ballot, but he acknowledged
the effect Allegheny County officials
have on student issues — namely,
public transportation. ,

"‘The.buses are very important
because students depend on them,”
he said. “It is important that we pro-
tect them.”_ '

Vermeire said that the most
important issue for him is jobs. Af-
ter graduation, he hopes to stay in
Pittsburgh if he can ﬁnd a place of
employment. .

“If people want to graduate and
get a job and want to‘ stay here, we
have to be able to get j obs,” he said.

- Freshman Emily Maccia, who
turned 18 in August, said she regis-
tered to vote on campus after she saw
the Pitt College Democrats holding
Obama campaign signs. I  "l t

“I_ think it is stupid to hate what’s
going on... and then not votej’ the
psychology major said. _ , '

But not everyone registered to
vote plans on casting his ballot.

Michael Barrett, an undeclared
sophomore, said he is choosing not to

- vote because he doesn’tknow enough

about who is running.

“I don’t think I should havea say
on something I don’t know anything
about,” he said. “If we are going to
vote for these people, [we should]
know what they are going to do.” I

er grades

more years of a second language
outscored other students on the
verbal and math portions of the
SAT. .

- Twyning said the Arts & Sci-

. ences Council‘ carefully monitors

the supply and demand of language
classes. He said he didn’t know yet
if the University would increase
the number of language classes
next year. _

If an increase in the demand of
language courses occurs because
of the upcoming requirement, the
University is prepared to respond
to speciﬁc needs as they arise, he
said. I I -

Students should
join movement

If you’re broke, unemployed, in
debt or angry with the govern-
ment, listen up.

Occupy Wall Street, an ongoing
demonstration in New York City, is
calling attention to socioeconomic
inequality and corporate greed.
The primary basis for the protest
is the huge economic disparity in
the U.S. between the rich and the
poor —— or the top 1 percent of
earners and the remaining 99 per-
cent. That one, small percentage
point controls about 40 percent
of the nation’s wealth.

The group A has launched a
Tumblr, “We Are The 99 Percent,”
which showcases the economic
hardships people — including
those with college degrees —— face
every day because of the nation’s
economy. As college students,

we’re doing everything we’re«

supposed to, even if it takes some
loans, right?

The people featured on the
site are college grads, parents,
honors students and professors.
Their sobering stories are enough
to make any college student dread
graduation day.

The point of this movement is
to bring attention to a huge na-
tional issue: the unsustainable
structure of the American ﬁnan-
cial system.

More than 700 protesters were
arrested this weekend after block-
ing traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge.
The event sent the movement into
the media stratosphere and gar-
nered support for the protesters,
but it was illegal, and illegal for a
reason —— blocking traffic could
mean blocking ambulances and
other emergency vehicles en route

to crises.

But what the demonstration
is doing correctly is taking itself
to the Internet and propagating
its cause throughoutthe nation,
spawning similar protests in Los
Angeles, Boston and other cit-
ies.

In just a few weeks, the cause
has gone from a few dozen par-
ticipants to thousands — and it
doesn’t look like that number is
stagnating anytime soon. Such
an exponential rate of growth is
bound to receive signiﬁcant at-
tention.

With tens of thousands of stu-
dents at Pitt, the majority of us
certainly are part of the 99 per-
cent. But there’s also a chance that

‘ some students make up a part of

the,1 percent, too.

Even so, the status of the econ-
omy should be on everyone’s mind,
and no one — even that 1 percent
— can afford to be comfortable
right now. Those with parents who
make up the 1 percent could very
well have to claw up after college
to achieve thevﬁnancially stable
life they grew up with.

But we now have a legal outlet
to channel our anxieties and pos-
sibly enact change — or at least
national discourse. All indications
point to the need for change, and a
movement like Occupy Wall Street
is exactly the way students should
voice their opinions — but only if
they do it safely and legally.

Pittsburgh could very well
become a hub of the movement,
but those who want to support the
cause don’t have to take it to the
streets. Log on, join in, but don’t

A cop out. Our nation needs this._J

But as we await that “Coup de Broc-

discouraging risky behavior become
appropriate. '
But when it comes to health risks,
there’s alinethat shouldbe respected:
Universities should reserve prohibi-
tion, the crudest tool of discourage-
ment, for health risks that are proven
to threaten lives. Otherwise, they’re
just treating students like babies and,
more importantly, denying reality.
Pitt bans smoking indoors 4 and
within 15 feet from campus buildings
—because decades of scientiﬁc stud-
ies have causally linked tobacco with
the development of life-threatening
maladies. On the other hand, energy
drinks, which don’t typically offer
more of their  active ingre-
dient, caffeine, than an 8-ounce cup
of coffee does, share no such reputa-
tion. Unless mixed with alcohol, en-
ergydrinl<scons11rnedinmoderation
have not been demonstrated to lead

' to severe health problems, atleast ac-

cording to available evidence.

That’s not to say energy drinks
are innocuous substances. UNH’s
ban-hungry administrators have a

reason to target energy drinks: Put —

simply, they’re not part of a long—term
healthy lifestyle. Sure, there’s the high
calorie content, the distorted circadian
rhythms and —— in extreme cases 4-
the risk of caffeine toxicity. But the

real danger lies in how energy-drink
reliance reinforces harmful imbal-
ances elsewhere. If a student decides

to use Amp to avoid the responsible

task ofbalancinghis schedule —so as,
perhaps. to stay up all night partying
but still get decent grades — is the
soon-to-be unsustainable behavior
the Amp’s fault?

If you’ve read my other columns,
the previous statement might strike
you as too laissez-faire formy taste
—— yes, I’ve written free-market her-
esy words like “safety net” before.
You’d also note that unlike Ron Paul, I
wouldn’t want the government to let
people exercise their“rightto die.” In-
stead, I think it’s appropriate for peo-
ple to exercise some “right” to make
manageable mistakes and then learn
from them. Yanking energy drinks
from college students’ grasps denies
themthis opportunity, in an uImeces-
sary and frankly babying manner.

Butallthisis assumingaban could

It’s common knowledge that psy-
chotherapy has come a long way

although most folks whoseek treat-
ment today know that they shouldn’t

know whatthey should expect. Hav-

sin the market for something

  
  

 

—' inyour case, .a therapist who is

competent, compassionate and well-
suited to you_and your needs ——- you
should try to go in with a sense of
what you want.

What do you picture when you

picture yourself in therapy? Do you .

want someone who will listen qui-

’ etly, or be forthcoming with lots of

insights? Do you want to plop down
and talk about whatever comes to
mind, or be guided with lots of ques-
tions? Do you want to feel uncondi-
tional support and positive regard,
or would you like someone to chal-
lenge you openly when you’re being
self— defeating?

Do you care whether your thera-
pist is a man or a woman? If you do,
it’s OK. As a devoted feminist, Ibeat
myself up forwanting my tlierapistto

nalized the idea that a man couldn’t
excel in such a touchy—feely profes-
sion? But for me, therapy required
that I open up about very personal

comfortable discussingwitha grown

_ man, no matter how sensitive. Politi-
‘ cal correctness, in this regard, would .
expect to lay on a couch and recount , i

What are your goals for therapy?

esteem, cope better with stressful
situations, recover from a past abu-
sive relationship or ﬁx your relation-
ship with your mother? Do you need
help-tnanaging your eating disorder

T Answeras many "of thesejques—
tions as you can before your ﬁrst
appointment. I would even recom-
mend’ compiling a written list of
the concerns that brought you to
therapy and your hopes, fears and
expectations about counseling.
Bring the list with you to your ﬁrst
appointment. Having a list of talk-

‘ . ingpoints can ensure that you don’t

freeze up, panic or answer the ques-
tion “What brought you here?” with
“I don’t know...”

Check in with yourselfcontinual-’
ly about what you want from therapy,
what your therapist can do to aid
you most effectively and whether he

or she is doing that. Don’t be afraid V

to give constructive feedback along
the lines of “Our discussion about X
was very helpﬁil in that...” or “When
you said Y, it made me feel worse
because...” A good therapist will
appreciate these insights and take
them into consideration.
Unfortunately, it is_ possible that
you will do everything right and still
have a terrible experience. My ﬁrst
psychologist — not at Pitt —— told

reason I felt lonely was because my
friends _didn’t want to spend time
with such a miserable person. A

transgendered friend of mine was I

told by a school counselor — also
not at Pitt — that he didn’t really
identify as a man, he just wanted
to dressthat way because he was a
sexual assault survivor.and didn’t

' want men to look at him.

Friends, if your therapist does
not respect your gender identity,
GTFO. Do notpass Go, do not collect
$200 — say goodbye, write ascath-
ing review in the oﬂice suggestions
box, and move on.

More broadly, althoughTV shows
like “Dr. Phil” have popularized the
idea of a “tough love” approach to
counseling, something is probably
wrong if your therapist makes you
feel like sh*t. Unless you’re seriously
harming or abusing someone inyour

’ life, there is very little reason therapy .

should make you feel guilty, belittled

or judged. Your therapist shouldn’t —

make you feel like you’re being melo-
dramatic and don’t really needhelp

‘ 4 or as though you’re stark, raving

bonkers.’

If your counselor makes -you feel
crappy —— or if the two of you just
aren’t compatible — you have the
right to terminate the relationship.
If you tell your therapist respectfully
that you don’t want to be his or her

patient anymore, you should not en— T

counter resistance, drama or sass.
If your counselor wants to ensure
that you continueto see somebody,
that’s one thing, but they shouldn’t:

try to insist that you continue to see

them.

My aforementioned ﬁrst thera-
pist, when I told her I didn’t want to
see her anymore, took it personally,
tried to change my mind and gener-
ally behaved like a j ilted ex-girlfriend.

Please don’t give up on therapy

if you’ve had a bad or mediocre _

experience with your ﬁrst (few)
counselor(-s). You wouldn’t quit
school because of one bad teacher,

. and you wouldn’t stop getting your

teeth checked because your ﬁrst den-
tist was a jerk. Finding a counselor

the right therapist for you

who’s right for you through trial and
error can be devastatingly frustrat-
ingwhen you’re dealing with mental
health problems, but it’s an ordeal
that’s well worth sticking out. |

COLLEGE

ATHLETES  
  BE PAID?  
They work hurd,puy up 2 Pay would corrupt  

by Greg Trietley

The minimum wage in this country is $7.25
per hour — unless you’re a college athlete.
College football players spend up to 20
hours per week at team facilities during the
season. If the NCAA didn’t set a limit,coaches

_ would ask for more. " . ~

Add in class time. Study time. Trips to and
from games. The games themselves.

Now how can student—athletes ﬁt a part-
time job into their schedules? How can they
earn money?

They can’t." The sport is their job, and a full
scholarship does nothing to support them on
a day—to—day basis.

In? fact, a joint study released in mid-
September by the National College Players
Association and Drexel University stated that
thefaverage full athletic scholarship had an
out—fof—pocket shortfall of $3,222, far from a
true ﬁill ride. Technically, the majority of FBS
football student—athletes lived below the pov-
erty line last year, according to the study.

- The study also noted‘ that the average Duke
basketball player was worth over $1 million to

the university but had to pay nearly $2,000 in .

out—of—pocket expenses not covered by their
scholarship each year. Blue Devils coach Mike
Krzyzewski, meanwhile, made over $4 million

' in the 2008-2009 ﬁscal year.

Opponents argue that paying student-
athletes turns them from amateur athletes
into professionals. But that’s according to
the NCAA’s deﬁnition. The Olympics’ inter-
national deﬁnition of amateurism allows for
endorsement deals and payment for auto-
graphs.

.Illegal beneﬁts prevail in the current sys-
tem because players can’t stay out of debt any
other way. College athletes can’t sign endorse-
ment deals. A thrifty apartment lease leads
to an investigation. They see no proﬁts from
ticket sales, merchandise sales or moves to
richer conferences. '

The NCAA is a tax—exempt, nonproﬁt
association, but college football programs

generated $1.1 billion in proﬁts in 2010. If '

student—athletes must play for the love of
the game, then schools shouldn’t charge
professional—football ticket prices. How
about a $5 suggested donation for the love
of the game? ‘

And not all student—athletes earn ﬁlll
scholarships, some athletes get a one—year

If you’ve ever watched a basketball game

during March Madness, you’re likely familiar V
with the commercial that states, “There are
V 380,000 [student—athletes] in the NCAA,
— and just about all of us will go pro in some-

thing other than sports.”
The comfnercial, ﬁlmed by the NCAA,

makes an important point. Students are i

at college to learn, to become more well—
rounded individuals and to prepare for their
futures. If most athletes aren’t going pro in
sports, they should be focusing on What they
will be doing with the rest of their lives.

In 2010, NCAA President Mark Emmert
made the priorities of the NCAA very clear.
He said that the organization would “never
move to a place where [the NCAA] is paying
athletes to play sports.”

The number one goal of the NCAA —
believe it or not, in light of recent events
— is said to be education. In exchange for
the labor of student—athletes, the NCAA and
the universities that take part in it mutually
contract to provide education.

The idea_of paying college athletes is not
only dangerous, but impractical. '

I understand the logic of those who sup-
port this illusory concept: “The coach is
getting paid millions, the university makes
tens of millions of dollars, and the athletes
don’t make anything.” But the issue gets
complicated.

How is a university going to justify paying

, the athletes of its revenue—earning sports

like football and basketball while it refuses
to pay athletes who play sports that make
less money, like swimming, diving and gym-
nastics?

At many universities, the football and
basketball programs are million-dollar in-
dustries. These sports generate more money
for the schools than likely all of their other
sports combined. Proponents of payi'ngcol—
lege athletes argue that these players should
be compensated for their efforts.

But smaller schools would not be able to
compensate theirvplayers in the same way
the big universities would. And additionally,
how would pay be divided? Is a school go-
ing to pay the starting quarterback and the
running back the team can’t win without the
same amount of money as the third-string
lineman?

Walking r into Kohli’s immediately gives one the impression of stepping into a crowded
Indian’! vazaar, with buyers impatiently trying to bargain their way through sales. But
a few paces in, boxes of Great Value mac ’n’ cheese and a slushie machine betray the
shopasgan Indian-American grocery store. A V ‘
.Sa‘nj ev “Sonny” Kohli has owned the store, located on South Craig Street, since
2002.  Oakland, the store serves as more than just a purveyor of food: For some it’s a
bite of ﬁgste from a faraway home, and for others it’s an introduction to the rich ﬂavor
' ; foods and culture. Kohli said'that Pittsburgh is a distinctly culture—conscious
city in at it never fails t_o make any ethnicity feel at home and its citizens often take
interes in these cultures. .
”“We show them some cookbooks, and some ways to make different dishes. It’s
a good‘ ay to tell them about Indian food and culture. And while they’re walking
around they often ask about the statues of gods everywhere — like Krishna and
Ganeshp —— and we explain it to them. It’s really good exposure to Indian culture and
religio ” Kohli said. - .
 He id it’s interesting to watch how two cultures blend in his own shop, which
offers“ '3 th American and Indian groceries. ' V
‘fwe ave 50 percent American customers and 50 percent Indian customers, and
wehafv more selling of Indian items. We are on the main street, so when people come
here fol cigarettes or candy or something, they make a round of the whole Indian store
andtth
rice, lee tils and spices.”
w‘Ton§ Bledsoe, a Pitt professor, cited three reasons he comes to this store: “First
of a1§l,<i the only convenience store on Craig Street  Secondly, [my wife] Meg and I
get San ev’s lunches or dinners to go. And another reason we go is sometimes, when
we coo , we need certain Indian spices.”

Shal<ira’s newest hit “Rabiosa” plays in the background during a typical scene at
Las Palmas 'I_‘aqueria, Carniceria y Supermercado: A Mexican woman with her

two children chooses specialty meat from the wide selection of carne adobada '

(marinated meat), al pastor pork (shepherd—style pork) and cueritos (pork rinds)
while a student curiously examines the array of chicken and salsa ﬂavorings.

Opened about seven months ago by Jose Berumen and his three brothers,
Las Palmas is the Oaklandversion of the family’s bigger mercado in Brookline,
which they opened about two years ago. Berumen and his brothers are originally
from Toluca, Mexico, and although they’re far from home, Berumen explains
that there is a signiﬁcant'Mexican population Pittsburgh, and speciﬁcally
in‘ Oakland. ' ' ' _ ”

Located near both Mad Mex and Mi Ranchito, popular restaurants serving up
Latin—American fare, Las Palmas helps to centralize the Mexican community of
Oakland. It also provides a convenient place for the Mexican restaurants to get
ingredients, as Carlos Cruz, owner of Mi Ranchito, frequently does. He7s visited.
the store a few times butusually sends someone for the necessary ingredients.-

Accordingtojuan Aldana, who often does ingredient runs for Cruz, Las Palmas
is one of three shops around town that offers plenty of Mexican ingredients (the
others are the Las Palmas in»Brookline and the Veracruz market ‘on Meyran).
Luckily, this one is just down the block. Aldana buys some of his own groceries
there too, like tortillas and peppers he uses for fajitas and tacos.

Alongwith taco meat, a popular product amongst students is fajita meat with I

peppers already mixed in, the store’s owner said. As for the beef tongue and beef
feet available?

If you’ve ever watched a basketball game
during March Madness, you’re likely familiar
with the commercial that states, “There are
380,000 [student-athletes] in the NCAA,
and just about all of us will go pro in some-
thing other than sports.’? 

The commercial, ﬁlrried by the NCAA,
makes an important point. Students are
at college to learn, to become more well-
rounded individuals and to prepare for their
futures. If most athletes aren’t going pro in
sports, they should be focusing on what they
will be doing with the rest of their lives.

In 2010, NCAA President Mark Emmert
made the priorities of the NCAA very clear.

——u

The fact is that more

players actually are

getting paid — and
in abig way.

——-99--———

He said that the organization would “never
move to a place where [the NCAA] is paying
athletes to play sports.” '

The number one goal of the NCAA -—
believe it or not, in light of recent events
—— is said to be education. In exchange for
the labor of student-athletes, the NCAA and
the universities that take part in it mutually
contract to provide education.

The idea of paying college athletes is not
only dangerous, but impractical.

I understand the logic of those who sup-
port this illusory concept: “The coach is get-
ting paid millions, the university makes tens
of millions of dollars, and the athletes don’t
make anything.” But the issue gets compli-
cated. ‘

How is a university going to justify paying
the athletes of its revenue—earning sports
like football and basketball while it refuses
to pay athletes who play sports that make
less money, like swimming, diving and gym-
nastics?

At many universities, the football and

basketball programs are million-dollar in-
dustries. These sports generate more money
for the schools than likely all of their other
sports combined. Proponents of paying col-
lege athletes argue that these players should
be compensated for their efforts.

But smaller schools would not be able to
compensate their players in the same way
the big universities would. And additionally,
how would pay be divided? Is a school go-
ing to pay the starting quarterback and the
running back the team can’t win without the
same amount of money as the third—string
lineman‘?

There is no fair way to solve this problem:
Players, are just going to be wanting dollar
bill after dollar bill.

The fact is that most players actually are
getting paid —— and in a big way. First, some
receive academic scholarships that include
stipends for books and either unlimited ac-
cess meal plans or monthly stipends for food
and living expenses. ’

Players receive access to state—of—the-art
facilities in which to train, more apparel
than most know what to do with and equip-
ment embroidered with University insignias
and their names and numbers, among other
luxuries.

The problem is that some do not realize
the total value of what is being given to them,
and many players, especially in the more
major, sports, are not graduating at all. j

Unfortunately, recent events at the Uni-
versity of Miami and Ohio State University
have brought to light situations that have
compromised the integrity of college ath-
letics — speciﬁcally college football. Both
schools had players who were using their
athletic celebrity to reap ﬁnancial ben-
eﬁts.

It_would be ignorant to believe that these

' abuses do not occur elsewhere — they most

assuredly do. The world of college athletics
has become increasingly corrupt in nature,
and the NCAA seems to continue to impose
mere slaps on the wrist as sentences.

Despite these regrettable scenarios,
though, the beauty of college football is just
that. It’s college. The line of separation must
be maintained between the professional and
collegiate levels of sport. In college, there
are no lockouts, no contracts, ‘no deal exten-
sions, nothing.

Just an athlete and the love of the game.
And that’s how it should remain. I

. WITH A GRAIN OF SAUL

Big cities face big confusion

October brings together playoff baseball, football and pre-season hockey

IsaacSaul » 

Assistant Sports Editor

For most Pittsburghers, the October
sports conundrum is not an issue.
When it comes to Sunday, there’s
no dilemma on what to watch in the
black—and—yellow nation. By-the
time Oct. 1 hits, the Pirates have
been dead for two months and the
Pens are months away from making
their Stanley Cup run, so the obvious
choice is to watch the Steelers.
Pittsburgh sports fans are fortu-
nate in this sense. You see, for some
cities, the October sports conun-
drum is more stressﬁil than mid-
terfns. Channels are being ﬂipped

. so wildly thataninnocentbystander 5

could have a seizure.

By now, these problems are in ‘

full swing. So let’s take a look at some
of the major cities that will be fac-
ing problems this October and shed
some light on what they should be
watching.

New York City

When you think about major _

sports cities, or just major cities in
general, the ﬁrst that comes to mind
is the Big Apple. It hosts more sports
teams with the potential to be play-
ing in October than any other city:
the Rangers, Islanders,]ets, Giants,
Mets and Yankees -‘—— enough to
make any New Yorker’s head spin.

But the decision might be easier
than you think. First off, who really
cares about the Rangers or the Is-
landers? Hockey preseason is lame
enough for the good teams, but
neither of these teams has been a
legitimate contender for the Stanley
Cup in years. The Rangers make the
playoffs here and there but will al-
ways live in the shadow of the Yanks
and Giants.

The Mets  well, yeah —— sorry
Mets fans, but your days of swinging

the bat in October have passed. -

That leaves the Yankees, Giants
andjets. Now, most people will tell
you that the typical New Yorker is
either a Mets and Jets fan or a Yan-
kees and Giants fan, so let’s assume
thejets fans have no tough choice to

make since their beloved Mets don’t
like to make the playoffs anymore.
This process of elimination
leaves the rest of New York choos-
ingbetween Eli Manning and Derek
jeter; Tom Coughlin andjoe Girardi;
Lawrence Tynes and Mariano Rive-
ra; threesuper Bowls and 27 World

Series Championships. Should I keep '

going? It’s gotta be Yankees ball.
Boston

The Patriots, Celtics, Bruins and
Red Sox make up this past decade’s
most dominant sports quartet.

For Boston fans, it’s tough to
make a wrong choice — but it’s
also tough to make anychoice at
all. From Tom Brady to Paul Pierce,
these teams all have their star power

and consistent playoff contending’

qualities.

But when October rolls around,

a conundrum arises when you have‘

to choose between the Pats, Bruins

and Red Sox.

This year, the Sox were part of '

a historic night in baseball. In one
evening, four games had playoff im-
plications, two went to extra innings
and another was decided in the last
‘at—bat. Unfortunately for the Red
Sox, their collapse was a historic
one — they became the ﬁrst team
to miss the playoffs after entering
September with a nine-game lead
in the wild-card.

With the Bosox on the outside
looking in, this choice is simpliﬁed:
N_FL regular season or NHL early
season? I’ll stick with Tom Brady
on this one. L

It should be mentioned, though, .

that the Boston teams have com-
bined for seven championships since
the turn of the millennium: three
for the Patriots, two for the Red Sox

and one a piece for the Celtics and ~

Bruins. After the Bruins made it to
the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, the city
became the second to have all four

VOLLEYBALL

Leggs leads Pitt .
to victory

Torie Wytiaz

Staﬁ'Writer.

This past weekend, Pitt women’s
volleyball team focused on getting
the ball to middle blocker and se-
nior Kiesha Leggs.

After leading her team offen-
sively in both of its matches and

‘ totaling 37 kills on the weekend,

Leggs ensured that the team
achieved that goal. V ,

“We really wanted to focus on
making each of Kiesha’s' scoring
opportunities count,” head coach
Toby Rens said of the Panthers’
game plan. “Kiesha did an excel-
lent job in responding to the chal-
lenge and providing an offensive
spark.”

For Leggs, her performance

was just her contribution to the

overall team effort.

“My personal goal is to do
whatever.I can do to help the team
win,” Leggs said. “I don’t really pay
attention to personal numbers, but
when the results lead to a victory,

' I notice that.”

Although the Panthers were

. successful in generating produc-

tion from the middle position, they
fell short of head coach Toby Rens’
larger goal of a weekend sweep. In
two Big East contests, the Panthers
recorded a win over Georgetown
but fell to Villanova.

“In the Big East, it is important
to get wins whenever possible, and
we hoped to get two this weekend,”
Rens said. “We weren’t able to ac-
complish that this weekend, but
we will take one win.”

On Friday night, the Panthers
(12-6, 2-2 Big East) came back
from a 0-1 set deﬁcit to defeat the
Georgetown Hoyas (9-8, 1-3) 3-1
with set scores of 25-14, 25-17 and‘

‘ 25-2o. " I -

Leggs paced the offensive at-

. tack, leading all players with 20

kills. Sophomore outside hitter
Monica Wignot contributed 12.
Defensively, the nine digs of
junior Alexa Campbell led the
Panthers, while freshman setter
Lindsey Zitzke and junior libero

Margy Acton contributed with
seven and six, respectively.

In the ﬁrst set, the Panthers
managed only eight kills, whereas
the Hoyas recorded 11 en route to
a 25-16 opening set victory. But as
the match progressed, the Panther
offense respondedland Pitt even-
tually gained thei'.ove,ralli’édge: in
kills, 50-35. : " C . -

Rens attributed the turn-
around after the ﬁrst-set loss to a
complete team effort.

“In the ﬁrst set, Georgetown re-
ally keyed in on Kiesha and it threw

' us off of our plan,” Rens said. “In

the rest of the match, the defense
and our other hitters stepped up so
that we could still use Kieshaland
come away with thewi-n.” A  :-

Leggs has come:to;expeVe_~,t and
even welcome, that .attentio_n ,fr;‘c_>jrn
other teams. ‘L ‘I   

“I like being that playergthat
the other team focuses ori-‘5’and
singles out,” Leggs said. “It gives
me a chance to really prove myself
and my skills by still being able to
produce offense.”

For the Panthers, the match
against Georgetown gave a chance
to demonstrate their ability to
overcome challenges —- especially
those encountered on the road.

“I was proud of how we were
able to come out strong after the
ﬁrst-set loss,” Acton said. “We
have a lot of inexperience and to
be able to come from behind to
win our ﬁrst Big East road match
is impressive.”

Acton said that, as a young
team, the Panthers will only con-
tinue to improve. The Panther ros-
ter contains only two seniors, and
sophomores and freshmen record

substantial court time.

However, the Panthers were
unable to record another match
win when they traveled to face

Villanova (12-5, 4-0) and suffered

a 3-1 defeat at the hands of the
Wildcats.

After dropping the ﬁrst set
25-21, the Panthers fought back
to earn a 26-24 victory. But the
Wildcats eliminated hopes of a

Pitt pros have offweek —

‘ Chris Fanelli
. Staff Writer

Week four of the NFL season proved to be a
little more difficult than previous weeks for
former Pitt Panthers in the professionals.
Lesean McCoy of the Philadelphia Eagles and
Larry Fitzgerald of the Arizona Cardinals both
failed to live up to their normal production,

and_ Darrelle Revis was helpless in -trying to ‘
lead his New York Jets to victory against the _

potent Baltimore Ravens.
V Fitzgerald (Pitt wide receiver-, 2002-2003)
had 8 catches for 108 yards — which seems
like solid stats — but he wasn’t able to come
up with a touchdown or connect with QB Kevin’
Kolb on a1ate—game.four“‘;-down conversion.
The Cardinals couldn’t hold on to their 27-17
lead and suffered a 31-27 loss to the New York
Giants. ' V ‘ . A
Also in the Cardinals- Giants game were Pitt
alums Henry Hynoski (Pitt ﬁ1llback, 2008-
2010) and LaRod Stephens-Howling (Pitt
running back, 2005-2008). Hynoski, who
plays fullback for the Giants, was targeted
twice by QB Eli Manning and was able to pull
in one catch for 5 yards. Stephens-Howling, a
running back for the Cardinals, returned from

V a hand injury that kept him out last week and
' had one rush for 1 yard, along with one recep— 1

tion for 9 yards.

McCoy (Pitt RB, 2007-2008) had led the 

NFC in rushing through the ﬁrst three weeks
of the season, but could only manage nine
"carries for 18 yards in a game where he got
roughed up a couple times. His Eagles seemed
determined to throw the ball and quarterback
Michael Vick threw for a career high 416 yards. '
McCoy also had six catches for 34 yards and

was able to haul in one of Vick's two touch- .

down passes, but the Eagles could have used
his ability on the ground to run out clock as
they squandered a 23-3 lead and continued.
their surprise early-season struggles, falling
to San Francisco 24-23.

The Eagles-49ers. game also featured V

multiple Panthers. Besides McCoy, the game

included Dion Lewis (Pitt running back, 2009- ’ l

2010), Andy Lee (Pitt punter, 2000-2003) and
Shawntae Spencer (Pitt comerback 2000-
2003). Lewis has primarily been working as
the kick returner for the Eagles and had two
kick returns for a total of 40 yards, as he con-
tinues to look for a breakthrough moment.

.Lee, who is the 49ers punter, is looking to

add another Pro Bowl to his resume, as he had
another solid day with four punts for a total
of 198 yards, which comes to a 49.5 average
and included a booming 68—yarder. Spencer
plays cornerback for the 49ers and contributed"
two solo tackles during the Niners’ comeback
victory. ,

All-Pro standout Revis (Pitt cornerback,
2004-2006) was able to get two tackles,‘ one of
which was solo, in awild game between Revis’
Jets and the Baltimore Ravens. Both teams’

‘ quarterbacks played very poorly in a game that

included ﬁve total defensive and special teams

touchdowns. The Ravens won the game 34-17.
to make a statement to the rest of the AFC that ’ ‘

they’re a major contender.

Dom Decicco (Pitt CB, 2007-2010).wasn’t
able to contribute any tackles as he continues
adjusting to linebacker, his new position with
the Chicago Bears. Regardless, Chicago "won
34-29 in aback—and-forth game against Caro-
lina that saw rookie sensation QB Cam Newton
continue his strong play for the Panthers.

ﬁve total tackles, two of whichlwere solo. De-
spite Sheard’s strong play, the Brownsfell 31-13

had a strong game for thejacksonvillejaguars
on his way to ﬁve tackles, four of whichwere
solo, and asack of QB Drew Brees. Even so, his
Jags fell 23-10 to the New Orleans Saints.

comeback as they took the ﬁnal two sets
25-14 and 25-21 to ensure a matchlwin.

Once again, Leggs led both teams with
her 17 kills from the middle blocker posi-
tion, and Wignot again reached double—digits
with her 10. g

The defense totaled 67 kills with Acton
recording 24 and freshman Delaney Clesen
chipping in with 15. . ‘

“Defensively, I thought we were very
strong,” Acton said. “Our goal is always to
keep the momentum on our side, which is
critical in close matches. We just weren’t
able to ﬁnish this time.” A

In the match, the teams tied 25 times with
12 lead changes 4 evidence that the two Big
East teams were evenly matched. 8

“Coming into the match, I thought that
we matched up well with Villanova and that
showed in the close sets as well,’’ Rens said.
“The difference seemed to be a bit more

poise on the part of Villanova and an abil-
ity to control the match after we took the ’

second set.” V

The Panthers will return home for two
matches next weekend at the Fitzgerald
Field House as they welcome Notre Dame

So although you can argue football’s great-
ness behind its‘ exciting brand of entertain-

city. Which team has the winners -— the ones
who get it done, who represent? In Philadel-
phia, that’s the Phillies.

Philadelphia

The debate over whether Philadelphia is a
baseball orafootball town has been ragingfor
years, and it’s pretty likely those manic Phila-
delphia fans will never make their minds up.

But one thing is for sure, and it’s that Phila-
delphia fans care. And they have a pretty damn
hard time choosing which sport to watch.

Up until a few years ago, the Phillies had
been making sporadic appearances in October
since their last World Series Championship
in 1980. For that reason, most people didn’t
have to choose until recently. «

But now, with Phillies baseball at the top
and the «Eagles ﬂying with one of the most
exciting teams in the NFL (e.g., Michael Vick,
LeSean McCoy," DeSeanJackson), most Philly
fans are split between Game Two and Week

diens and Toronto Maple Leafs).

The Tigers had a rebirth in 2006 when ‘
they returned to the World Series but would
follow it up with three seasons of second-half
collapses that left them out of the playoffs.

This year, with the Tigers battling the Yan-
kees in the ﬁrst round of the playoffs (and
sporting baseball’s premier player,Justin Ver- «.
lander), Detroit fans are going to have to make
a choice. This is, after all, a hockey town. In
fact, it might be the only city on this list that
would choose Red Wings preseason hockey
over anything else.

But that was before the Lions started 4-0.
That was before Calvin Johnson became the
most dominant player in the NFL. That was
before they found a franchise quarterback in
Matthew Stafford.

Now the fans have to choose. Although it’s
tough to say -— and many might pick the Red

, Wings no-matter what — I think the Lions are «c»

the sensible choice. H .
There are a few reasons for this: 1) Calvin
Johnson. 2) CalvinJohnson. 3) NFL.com isn’t
broken, the Lions actually are undefeated. 4)
CalvinJohnson. . -
The Tigers are probably going to be elimi-
nated by the Yankees anyway, and if fans don’t
get behind the Lions now, when will they?
The same formula goes for the Philadelphia
conundrum: If they’re winning, if they’re rep-
resenting, you’ve got to back them up. I
