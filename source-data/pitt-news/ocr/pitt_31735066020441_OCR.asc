Schoolconﬁnue

By Lisa B. Keer
The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical School, home of transplant
expert Dr. Thomas Starzl and the
polio vaccine, is home to another
kind of drama, one which could cen-
ter on the health of the medical
school itself.

The difficulties began in
November 1983, as Assistant Dean
for Academic Affairs Dr. Robert
Olson resigned at the request of Dr.
Donald F. Leon, then medical
school dean, over what was termed
“disruptive philosophy of manage-
ment” on Olson’s part.

Olson was also relieved of his
duties as director of the Heinz Nutri-
tion Center in January 1984 by
former Associate Senior Vice _Chan-
cellor for the Health Sciences Dr.
Thomas Detre. Grant funds total-
ling $220,000 were returned on the
grounds that Olson_would be unable
to oversee the center since he was no
longer a senior‘ administrator."

The unrest continued when Leon
resigned as dean effective June 30,
1984. Leon cited his interest in

At Saturday's football game
against Oklahoma, dedicated fans
will be sporting more than their
usual Pitt T-shirts, caps an
banners. i

For this game, many fans are
expected to display their school
spirit with blue and gold body paint.

That’s right, body paint. Last
weekend, Alabama fans attending
the game against Boston College
creativelyipainted their arms, legs
and faces. The official count of 8,27]
painted faces actually established a
world record to be printed in the
Guiness Book of Records. How
about that, Pitt fans?

Can Pitt break this record?

retiirning to academic commitments
as the reason for his resignation.
Leon remains on the medical school
Iaculty.

Nathan Stark, senior vice chan-
cellor for the health sciences, and
Detre were to oversee the adminis-
tration of the medical school until a
new dean is chosen.

On July 9, I984, Stark resigned
his position effective December 31
oruntil a successor can be chosen.
Stark cited his interest in returning
to law practice as the reason for his
resignation. Detre was named to
serve as interim dean, and will
remain in his position as seniorvice
chancellor for the health related
professions. ,.

So where does this leave the medi-
cal school?

According to Jane Duffield of the
health sciences news publications
bureau, the search committee must
first find a_ new senior vice chancel-
lot for the health sciences before it
can concentrate on finding a new
dean. Duffield could not provide a
time frame for this search.

Dr. Henry T. Bahnson,‘—head of
the search committee, was unavaila-
ble for comment, so it is not yet
known what progress the committee
is making. ' . A

thinks so and has set out to accom-
plish just that, according to SGB
‘President Ken Strain.

The idea was introduced ._by
Generik .Ink, Inc.', a company that
produces body paints for use at Hal-
loween, representative Lee Martin
explained. “To promote our pro-
duct, we tried the idea in Alabama
and it was a success,” he said. So
now thcy’re bringing it to
Pittsburgh.

“What we do,” he said, “is donate
allthe paint, brushes and promo-
tional necessities, and‘ Pitt supplies
the bodies.” -

What is this wildness all about,
you might wonder? Well, as Ken
Stram see_s it, the whole idea should
really hefp generate school spirit. ~

Hillel rapped on funding

By Alison Sterne  
The Pitt News

In a heated meeting-yesterday, the
Student Government Board
approved funding of a lecture for the
Pitt Hillel Club. But it did so only
after strongly condemning the club’s

, procedural violations in requesting

funds.
The Allocations Committee
recommended that the board

approve $3,500 for the honrorium
and promotion of the lecture,
adding that a letter of reprimand be
sent to the club. .The letter would
serve as a warning to the club that ‘
any further violations may cause
sanctions against it.

The problem started as a

misunderstanding on the Hillel
Club’s part of how to get money out
of escrow: Escrow, as a member of
the board explained it, is money held
in a fund that will be released to the
user on fulfillment of certain
requirements — in this case, that
requirement was co-sponsorship by
the Pitt Program Council. ——

Allocations chairman John
Benchoff admitted that the violation
was unintentional. ‘ V ~
. “There ‘ was ' an informal
agreement between the Hillel Club
and the PFC." However, the official
planning worksheet was never
signed.” ~

Board member David Pakovsky
requested better organization from
the club in the future. Pakovsky
said, “A lot “of people were getting

very irritated about the violation. I
just thought it should be known."

Hillel Club Advisor Rabbi Joseph
Levine apologized to the board,
adding that he thought the mistake
was simply “a breakdown in
communications. _

“I want to thank you for having

the generosity to let us have another
chance at it,” Levine said.
_ Due to the mix-up, ‘Dr. Chaim
Potok’s speech will be moved back
from Sept. 20 to sometime in the
winter term. . -

Other business conducted at
yesterday’s meeting included the
approval of Jim Glass as Elections
Committee chairman and the
appointment of Athena Zaras and
Pamela Hart to the Student Media
Board. -

Reporting questioned
Gay organization enraged at questionable

reporting methods of Dartmouth Review writer.

Reporter’s ethics criticized

WASHINGTON (USPS) —
Dartmouth sophomore Teresa
Polenz is undergoing criminal inves-
tigation in New Hampshire while the
state determines whether she vio-
lated wiretapping and privacy laws
by secretly taperecording a Gay Stu-
dent Association meeting earlier this
year. ,

Miss Polenz attended the meeting
on an investigative assignment for
the Dartmouth Review, a conserva-
tive student weekly, to find out
exactly how the GSA was spending
money received from Dartmouth
College. The college annually gives
$500 to the GSA and provides rent-
free office space for association

meetings. The Dartmouth Review.

had twice asked GSA how it spent its
allocation from student activity fees,
but the group had never given any
answer. ‘

4'1-' A

Miss Polenz had learned about

the meeting from a classified adver- »

tisement placed in a local paper. All
' previous meetings of the association
had been advertised in a local paper
and some had been announced as
open to the ‘public on small ﬂiers
posted around the Dartmouth Cam-
pus. Without identifying herself as a
reporter, Miss Polenz went to the
meeting and recorded the entire ses-
sion, in the course of which some
students discussed their sexual expe-
riences and sexual identities.
According to Miss Polenz, GSA
officers later came to her room and
tried to pressure her into giving up
the tapes, but she refused. The Dart-
mouth Review later published
excerpts from the tapes without
naming any of the participants,
though it did mention two well-
knownofficers of the GSA. -

Publication of the excerpts pro-
voked a storm of controversy on the
Dartmouth Campus, with one side
supporting the Review’s First
Amendment rights to print public
‘information and the other calling for
protection of the homosexual
group’s right to privacy.

A spokesman for the GSA stated 7

that participants expected privacy
because of a long oath of confiden-
tiality read by-a group leader at the
start of the meeting. Miss Polenz
said that she had been present while
the oath had been read, but she
insisted that she had not taken the

oath herself. She added that those’

who came to the meeting late would

- not have even know~about the oath.

But Laura Ingraham, Editor of
the Dartmouth‘Review said, “lt’s a
freedom of the press issue,
obviously.”

Both the GSA and the Dartmouth
Review" have gone tothe New
Hampshire Civil Liberties Union for
assistance. Commenting on the case,
Claire Ebel, executive director of the
civil liberties group, said the key
issue to resolve was whether pro-
ceedings at the meeting were truly
open to all comers and hence public
information, or whether those in
attendance at the meeting had, a leg-
itimate expectation of privacy.
‘-‘While attorneys felt very strongly
for the First Amendment freedom of
press arguments, they felt equally

strongly that what the reporter did j

was unethical,” she told the New
York Times. - '

The Dartmouth Committee on

Standards was also considering
whether to take disciplinary action
against Miss Polenz, but the com-
mittee decision was postponed to
await the outcome of the state inves-
tigation. The committee had origi-
nally set a hearing for May_25, but
the hearing was suddenly postponed
when New York Times reporters
showed up to cover it and the Wall
Street Journal ran an editorial com-

  Radio-Active

The university has recently launched its FM radio
station and last year spent $100,000 to install a new
computerized word processing system to modernize The
Pitt News. So one would hardly think that student media
sources at the University of Pittsburgh are in danger of
losing their student ﬂavor.

But this is exactly what may occur at WPTS if there is
not sufficient student input. The campus radio station
has become more vulnerable to becoming an instrument
of the university’s administration.

Pitt’s radio station is currently commercial-free — and
should stay that way. However, the station’s position at
98.5 places it in one of the most fiercely competitive spots
on the dial. In this location, Pitt’s radio station occupies
one of the most expensive piecesof radio real estate. The
economic potential of such a station could be quite
rewarding. And the university is painfully aware of eco-
nomics and where it can pick up a few extra bucks.

Planting a nonprofit station in such a ﬁnancially fertile
plot is analogous to opening a thrift shop on Fifth
Avenue in New York City. The potential to turn the
station into a commercial, money-making operation
would doom the creativity of a student-operated radio
station.

Pitt’s is the first college radio station with no commer-
cials ever to break out of the traditional_(below 92) col-
lege section of the dial. Although there has been no open
example of the university's severely limiting the freedom
of the station, the potential for abuse is terrific. The new
general manager is not a student, but rather a university
employee, as is the news director for the "station, a posi-
tion equivalent to that of editor of The Pitt News.

This was done supposedly at the behest of the FCC.
Regardless of how or why a university employee is the
general manager, the person in this position has the
power to hire and fire the students operating the station.
The radio station’s programming should be a student
decision with the university in an advisory position.

That Pitt students have an FM station is a great poten-
tial opportunity for students to express themselves artis-
tically while learning radio broadcasting. Although the
university has done little to overtly influence the format
of the station, the possibility of abuse is equally as great.
The student body should be increasing its control of its
radio station rather than diminishing it.

Injury to Pitt
student

raises anger

Nothing can be more sickening or
more tragic than the image of a 21-
year-old run down in the street in
front of his school. A young life, like

ours, may be ended, may be changed '

forever, all'for the sake of someone
getting somewhere faster in his car.
How can you go to classes after see-
ing something like that — students,
herded like cattle across streets when
the ‘cars let them, implicitly threat-

‘ ened with “this could be you.”

Oakland, and particularly the few
blocks of Fifth Ave. between the
Cathedral and the hospitals, is an
area of great student pedestrian traf-
tic. This area is the University of
Pittsburgh, and while no one can say
it is right for students to run across
streets here, there can be no excuse
for the raceway attitude that prevails
along Fifth.

When I drive through here, I
really do stick to 25 miles per hour;
the car that hit Timothy DeVine was
going much faster. Simple human
consideration should have us all put
up with driving slowly for these few
blocks, but the green lights after
Craig St. are set up in a sequential
fashion that drivers often exploit.
They know the lights through our
campus click to green one after the
other and, if driven right, can all be
hit. ‘

But not so at Fifth and Craig. .
There, the Oakland community last
year held well-organized meetings
leading to the city's installing a full
stop-walk sign for that intersection’s
many pedestrians. The community
accomplished this last year at the
same time that Chancellor Posvar
wrote to tell me that there was very

little that could be done to change
the light at the Cathedral (Fifth and
Bigelow) to a similar full stop-walk
because ‘_‘Fifth is a state-maintained
road.”

A I have met nothing but indiffer-
ence in my correspondences about
the total lack of consideration for
student safety in crossing Fifth Ave.
Chancellor Posvar barely acknowl-
edged the question, saying that I

, could see the evidence of the univer-

sity’s concern by the (then) newly
erected blue railings along Fifth.

A full stop-walk at Fifth and
Bigelow would do so much to pro-
tect our safety. First, it is unques-
tionably the most-crossed
intersection on campus and also the
largest and best-protected. The

' Cathedral is the heart of the univer-

sity along with the William Pitt
Union and gets easily double the
pedestrian crossing of Fifth and

Craig, yet they were able to protect _‘

their many pedestrians. Second, and
perhaps even more important, it

would break the chain of lights on -

the “raceway” down Fifth.
I can’t say that that would have
made the difference in the two tragic

student accidents, but it would help ’

the traffic problem immeasurably.
For there is no feeling, driving down

Fifth, that this is a college campus —
there are no full stop-walks at the big
intersections; traffic moves fast.

The university only adds to the
problem with its total lack of con-
cern and action. Oakland is an
important world community
because of the university and the
university hospitals, and the univer-
sity is what it is because of us. Yet it
is stunning and really disgusting
how, with the university’s huge
budget, it can just overlook the sim-
ple changes that must be enacted for
our basic safety.

They cry in the dark so you can '1 see
their tears/ They hide in the light so
you can ’t see their fears] Forgive
and forget all the while/ Love and
pain become one and the same in the
eyes of a wounded child/ Because
hell, hell is for children.

— —Pat Benatar, "Hell is for Children”

It is unfortunate that this song re-
fers not only to child abuse but has
corollaries to the role of women in
our society. Hell is reserved for
women as well as abused children.

There recently has been discus-
sion over pending legislation to cas-
trate child molesters and efforts to
extend the penalty to rapists. While
the intention is laudable (i.e., stop
rape), the method is simply an infan-
tile and emotional response to a very

real social problem. At best, such

reactions do no harm — or good —
improving the situation and, there-
fore, no further action is needed.
Before we can stop the occurrence of
rape, we must understand what it is
and how anti-rape efforts in the past
have failed.

First, what is rape? This is not a
rhetorical question. Part of the
debate over how to deal with rape is
over definitions. The more limited
the definition, the shorter the range
of solutions that are suggested.
Rape, therefore, must be seen within
the context of society,'and it is an
unfortunate reality that this society
allows and supports violence against
women. Rape is simply one manifes-
tation of this phenomenon.

Before this definition can be
accepted, we have to step back
further and see the place of women
in society to understand how society
supports violence against women.
Until fairly recently, society has not
recognized women as human beings.
Their rights to have property and
jobs and to vote have been limited by
laws throughout history. Their place
in society has been ‘limited to their

« relationship to males, specifically
- their father or mate. ‘

This attitude is prevalent in popu-
lar culture. Anyone who has seen
rock videos and doesn't recognize
the general treatment of women as
sexual objects and blatant acts of
violence against women is blind.
Music companies are following the
,age—old Madison Avenue cliche that
sex sells, and sex in this society
means the subjugation of women.

Similarly, movies show women
not just as objects but objects that
want and beg for sex even while they
publicly say “No.” “Porky’s” and
“Flashdance,” two of the worst films
ever to make money, are perfect
examples of this. In “Porky’s,” the
plot centers around the local high
school boys trying to gain access to a
whorehouse, that is, when they
aren’t being literally dragged. behind
the bushes by their female peers.
“Flashdance” is the story of the typi-
cal steel welder who yearns to.be'a
ballet dancer. In gaining her objec-
tive, she works in an avant-garde bar
as a dancer, wearing nothing but a
g-string, and has sex with the owner
of her plant.

Societal treatment of women as
objects is a very small step away
from seeing male violence against
women as acceptable. We don’t put
people (i.e., males) in jail for putting

A their fists through a door in anger, so

why should we when they slap their
wife or girlfriend around? Police and
prosecuting attorneys have long
taken this attitude. In family dis-
putes, the police method is to get the
couple back together, not to put the
aggressor behind bars. Generally,
the police are called back to the same

couple over and over again. In the I

few areas where police actually put
wife/ husband abusers behind bars,
the _perpetrators learn very quickly
that their behavior is frowned on by

authority, and incidents of repeat .

beatings drop dramatically.‘

i I

Rape is treated in the same way.
Cops and prosecutors define rape as
a crime of love or sex. To prosecute
rapists, they want a signed confes-
sion by the criminal or, at least eye-
witnesses. If rapists kill their victims,
it’s even better; then they can prose-
cute for murder rather than rape. In

rape trials, the victim’s entire life and

character are on display and judged.
If the victim can’t prove‘ she spent

.her entire life in a nunnery, she can

forget about justice.
The argument for considering

rape as a violent crime has more sup-
port than from just impressionistic
evidence. Psychological studies of
convicted rapists show they get
enjoyment from the violent, not the
sexual, part of their act. Castration,
therefore, would not stop them from
committing the crime. Rapists are
shown films of violent acts against
women with -and without explicit

"sexual scenes, and their measure--

ments of arousal and enjoyment are
the same. These same studies also
indicate the pervasiveness of these

  

 

'5 we comes

        
       
        
       

attitudes in the general population:
I0 percent male respondents admit-
ted having physically forced a
woman to engage in sex, and 30 per-
cent answered questionnaires with
responses similar to convicted
rapists as well as saying they could
imagine circumstances in which they
could commit rape.

Rape must be dealt with in two
ways. One is by dealing with the
widely held acceptance of violence
against women by changing people's
attitudes about gender roles. This

requires a lot of time, namely gener-
ations. In the short term, we can deal
with rape as a symptom of this vio-
lence and get legislative and judicial
acceptance for treating rape as a
crime of violence. In order to do
either, we must recognize rape for
what/it is, a social evil that mustbe
examined and dealt with in a
rational way.

National Hewsbriefs

UPI — There are indications that
President Reagan may be ready to
back off from the touchy issue of
mixing religion and politics.

Apparently, the president thought
that when he addressed a prayer
breakfast at the

   

Republc _

National Convention in Dallas that
he was speaking to a select audience
and that it would all end there.
Unfortunately for the president,
his speech was distributed by the
White House. That caused wides-
pread consternation and gave

Democratic candidate Walter Mon-
dale an isue to pounce on.

In his speech, Reagan said politics
and religion are “necessarily related”
a comment that to some appeared to
challenge the constitutional premise
separating church and state.

Mondale accused Reagan of seek-
ing to establish conservative Chris-
tianity as a “state religion” and
charged the President with believing
that “God is a Republican.”

Reagan replied by saying, as poli-
ticians so often do, that his views
had been distorted. He said he was
really talking about a movement to
eliminate chaplains from the mil-
itary services and criticizing those
who would like to remove the slogan
“In God We Trust" from coins.

If there is a movement in this
countryito remove chaplains from
the military, it's a deep, dark secret.

During his three and one-half
years in office, Reagan has taken
positions that once were taboo in
terms of keeping a strong barrier
between church and state relations.

Some other presidents have,

wanted to send a U.S. ambassador
to the Vatican, but did not dare pro-
pose it. Under Reagan’s sponsor-

V ship, such legislation sailed through

Congress.

In addition, the Republican plat-
form, which Reagan has endorsed,
would key appointments of federal
judges on whether or not they’
favored abortion.

But in a speech to the Jewish ser-
‘vice organization B’nai B’rith, Rea-
gan clarified things a little. He said
there is “a wall of separation”
between church and state in Amer-
ica and he approves of it.

That moderate approach is more
in line with what Reagan's advisors
want. And unless Mondale succeeds
in stirring things up and putting
Reagan on the defensive, it's likely
the whole issue will fade away.

UPI ~—- President Reagan has
returned to the White House follow-
ing a campaign stop in Nashville, the
capital of countrv music. In a speech

_to business people there, the presi-

dent contrasted what he likes to call
the nation’s high tech trailblazers
with what he termed the “faint-
hearted souls" represented by his
Democratic foes.

Reagan also visited Nashville’s
Grand Ole Opry to pay ho age to
country music king Roy Ac ff, who
celebrates his 81st birthday on
Saturday.

Walter Mondale took his cam-
paign to Tupelo, Mississippi, yester-
day, where he accused President
Reagan of favoring"“mean-spirited”
and “shameful” cuts in the Medicare
program. The Democratic presiden-
tial candidate says Reagan's pro-
gram on Medicare is nothing short
of “official cruelty." He says the
President is out to destroy Medicare
by proposing to out $30 billion more
from the program. .

_It is early afternoon on an unusu-
ally warm spring day in Pittsburgh.
The sun shines high over the Oak-
land section of town as foot travellers
stop to browse or take refuge in any
number of shops or restaurants that
lie on either side of the crowded
streets. Some grab a cool drink or a
fix ofrjunk food while others, total

- escapists, parlay their pocket change

in head-to-head combat with some
ultra-destructive video alien.‘

So much for the mundane.

Some people in this world have
precious little spare time to spend on

"such ordinary activities as refresh-

ment and video warfare. Case in
point: Steve Hansen, radio satirist
and occasional writer,‘the zanier side
of WDV7" radio's morning team,
”]immy and Steve.”

am:

The main door of C]. Barney's
swings open and from out of the bus-
tle appears a figure, every inch of six:
feet-two, a well proportioned
thinness, sporting sunglasses. Could
this be another snobbish, self-
aggrandizing celebrity? Anotherjrock
’_n’ roll radio playboy? Reaching his
hand to his brow, he flicks a few
wisps of rapidly thinning blond hair
back into position and gently grasps
the burnt orange frames of his
shades, removing them indoors as
most would. As he ambles toward the
corner table and his awaiting party, a
boyish grin overtakes his face. He is
more than a few minutes late and
apologizes with a warm smile and a
handshake. . —

Formalities completed, the conver
sation shifts to his faded purple shirt,
an aging garment covered with
assorted pale blue musical notes, not

the least bit conspicuous for one of_

the most popular radio personalities
in the city.
”I could look absolutely great each

' ‘morning and who'd -notice?” offers"

Hansen, poking fun at his less than
glamorous approach to wardrobe.

The early afternoon is actually late
in the day for this 35-year-old bache-
lor, who is usually groping for his
clothing at 4:36 a.m. just to be ready
to commence being funny an hour
later.

Consider the? challenge.’ How does

' one provoke laughter from someone"

who is up at an hour when most
Americans would prefer uncon--
sciousness to listening to rock ’n’ roll?
Project a friendly, enthusiastic voice?
(Snore...) Try out a repertoire of cute
jokes? (Yawn...) Bombard the listener
with outrageous political and social
satire? Well, for the many loyal
"Jimmy and Steve” fans, the result is
better than ten cups of coffee.

Hansen, and his cohort Jimmy
Roach, although decidedly irreverent
in the themes of their skits and jokes,
take their work as seriously as
anyone. ”]us,t think about it,” reflects
Hansen with conviction, ”we myste-
riously creep into people's bedrooms
each morning and enter a secret
realm in their brains. We become
their friends.” . ‘

He pokes at the mushroom-
cheeseburger on the plate in front of
him and tosses a french fry into «his
mouth. "It is all kind of mystical to
me. Early in the morning we're -in a
privileged little environment, and
then, like magic, we're inside your
radios.” - ' .

His thumb and forefinger habitu-

~ ally smooth the hairs of his closely-

cropped beard. Steve expresses
modest concern for the future of the

’’Morning Alternative” and a sense of "

self-criticism and ‘doubt that goes
hand-in-hand with any creative
endeavor. ”It really bothers me if the
material we have on a particular‘
morning isn't what I'd call good. "If the

_ show ever.burns out, it will be for

want of effort. Nothing else.”

As a child, Hansen spent‘ his
impressionable years in metropolitan
Minneapolis, Minnesota. The eldest
child and only son of H.K. and Marlys

influenced by his father, ”a tremen-

gifts as a newspaper contributor and
eventually as a technical writer.

work, Steve criticizes him for
”squandering his talent by being too
much of a craftsman.” j .

It was during these years that he
learned his preliminary lessons, that
would later be learned first hand, in
the brutish realism of the writer's
life. ”It’s not polite at all . . . unlike
making a record or a movie, where
there are lots of people around  .it’s
very lonely and solitary.”

His eyes gather tension, the tiny
lines of 35 become bolder as he
attempts to paint a portrait of the
prototypically obsessed writer.

”Here's a guy, all rumpled and
cramped, wide-eyed from too much
caffeine, slumped over his typewriter

twenty years or so . . . ” a pause, a
deep breath and another french fry.

”I’ve never called myself a writer,
with a capital ‘W.’ A writer is some-
thing you are from birth, like being
left—handed. I see it as a cursemore
than anything else."

However unattractive the writing
life may appear to Hansen, there is a
scrambled sense of romance to it- that
brings him to sit up straight and
speak with admiration for those with
the intestinal fortitude to live on that
razor ‘edge of sanity. Thenames of
Waits, Bukowski and Pirsig are inter-

v jected into the conversation with
genuine spirit and painfully persona-l

acteristic he's assimilated as a method
of dealing with failure, the inescapa-

”Low life and failure have a kind of
allure for me. You can go to a skid

by the grace of God, could have been

walking that line and that's what
makes him interesting."

‘there is a series of white shelves

seems so strategic, a sort of artistic
disarray. .

After a preliminary chat concern-
ing the positioning of the framed

‘ conversation reverts back to the edge {

of ‘sanity. A slow swig. A heavy

But still there is danger. Thatof

Hansen came to know vividly in his
late twenties.

A‘ A far-away stare grips Hansen's
deep-set eyes. The marks of the years
seem to leave his face. The early '60s.
Seated in a’ club, H.K. at his side. Here
at the behest of his father, he sits in
the dimly lit room with anticipation.
Suddenly, a bright light focuses on
the performance area, spotlighting a
brief but effective satiric skit. Black-
out. Applause. Lights. Skit. Blackout.
Applause. Lights....

‘short skit format. ’Franken and
V’Davis,' remember them from Saturday
Night Live? Well, they came from
there. I liked the satire idea and even
did some writing for that club."

I At this point in his life, ‘however, he
made no career oriented decisions. A
restless youth who liked to communi-
cate, but enjoyed being alone; a
young man with a desire to write but
fearful of the writing life, Steve was

still trying to find himself. Blackout.

Lights. A field of gladiolas some-
where in Minnesota. Summer 1963.
A bushy-blond headed Hansen toils
in the scorching sun, pulling ‘weeds

Picks up his weeding tool and basket.

'_ A look of boredom. Tosses the tool
and basket aside. He reaches. for his
new portable radio and turns it on.
.Music. Voices. A smile. Blackout.’

Steve recalls his feelings from that
time. ”I ‘started listening to the radio
becausevl was bored out there in the

79field. I thought ‘Hey, that seems
easy.’ Life sort of gave me the things I

- do. I have no trade skills.”

And sobegan the hobby that, after
graduating in 1967, would take him
to three universities (two of which he

_actually attended, the other used for
broadcasting purposes only), and to
the western and eastern extremes of
the country.

a hobby,” although he did consider
career possibilities. He grins. "In
ninth grade I did my career speech
and said that I wanted to be a disc
jockey. The only problem was that. . .

he finallyjourneyed to the place. Sit-
ting the empty beer can on the floor,
he straightens up.

”I was finally there. ‘Mecca.’ San
Francisco. I went for the experience
of it. I had been reading Rolling Stone,
which I supposed turned me on to
San Francisco. I embraced the idea of
living" in communes and all that, and I

hope I never forget that that was a-

good idea. I do lose touch with it
sometimes.” _ »
Attracted by the world of the hip-
pie, Hansen claims that he can always
don the look, but was never deeply
immersed in the ideology. He ‘chose
to_ remain on the outside, always the
observer. It was during thetrying
times in the few years that followed
that ‘Hansen solidified his under-
standing of the learningprocess that
is implicit in the experience of failure.
"I have a real kinship with failure.
You should learn things’ from ‘it. It
can be very humanizing. The second
you think you're a big deal, you're
lost." ‘
Failure. The topic keeps creeping

into his speech. It is an aspect of life‘

that he feels is worth experiencing.
The feeling of being alone and down-
and-out can be very sobering. Usually
the largest and most devastating fail-
ures are.those in. which the element
of risk has been imposed, in varying
degrees.

”I don't have much respect for
those who go straight through life
from one safe step to another. I
respect those who have a story.”

Hansen's own story intensified
during his period in San Francisco.

He arrived there in 1976 to an
appealing" radio job with a burgeoning
free-form station. ”There was real
good money for a while,,then they
changed the format and got rid of the
staff.”. - I -

Forced to test his resourcefulness,
Steve supported himself through a
variety of odd jobs. This was his con-
dition until the end of 1978. It was
manageable. He _continued to
observe, hanging out with- people
who were -heavily into various areas
of alternative living, but always
maintaining the aesthetic distance
necessary to keep himself in order.
Then came the two-year span he
speaks of with reverence, contrasting
theeasy-going light in which he is
generally seen. The kinship with‘fail-
ure manifests‘ itself. He teeters on the

edge, ventures into the orchard and -

shakes some trees of his own.

point, Steve's situation worsened. He

was living among the abusers and the

downtrodden, with no real guarantee
.of salvaging his life and career.

"I started ‘out with the idea for a
book. At first I had visions of a liter-
ary treatise on San Francisco, but it
was no great art. I kept reminding

I myself; ’Hansen,_ you are writing a
guide book. It's worthless if it doesn't
function.’ "’

His obsession with the project cost
him. Steve lost touch with - the
woman he loved. There was ‘nothing
tangible to offer her, for he hadno job

the possibility of never finishing the
book, what I had started out to do and
invested so much time in.”

The Other Guide to San Francisco, after
nearly two years of isolation and near
destitution, was published in 1980 by
Chronicle Publishing in San Fran-
cisco. Steve sits back once again, and’
thumbs through a copy of the book.

”It was my love letter to San Fran-

STOP MAKING SENSE

C Talking Heads ’

Sire

‘ Stop,Making Sense is a Talking
Heads concert film slated for fall
release. Even though this band
just released a live record two
years ago, you can bet that
David Byrne and his pals were
pretty much compelled to put
out- an accompanying record,

given the incredible money-

making ability of soundtrack
records in the last several years.

It seems that Byrne himself is
a little self-conscious about so
prolific a flow of live records.
The back of the glossy booklet
that accompanies this new
release asks in big print, ”Why
Stop Making Sense? Why a movie?
Why tour? ...” So we have to
ask, ”Why buy this apparent
new slab of redundancy? Why
should the consumer pay for
new versions, not new
material?”

The answers can be found

' only in the grooves. This could

be the best live record anybody.'s
ever done. It takes chances but
doesn't get sloppy in the pro-
cess. The Talking Heads have
finally perfected the danger-
ously cumbersome nine-piece
band. When they first tackled
the polyrhythmic material
that's now become their forte

back in 1980 with FearofMusic, it

PHANTOMS
The Fixx
MCA

If the Fixx were to take them-
selves any more seriously,
they'd be in need of a good ana-
lyst. This new 12-song set is yet
another superficial peek into
the more desperate venues of
life from a band who would like

required a more ‘ambitious
rhythm section. It was achieved
in 1981's Remain in Light with a
dense percolating complexity.
Sometimes, though, the
melange became so free-
wheeling and muddy that the
individual parts were lost. The
music was BIG, but not as pre-
cise. Until now, that is.

They still have a nine-piece
band, but thi_s music has the
brisk directness of a tightly con-
trolled studio recording. These
versions are better than their

studio counterparts. ”Burning»

Down the House,” for example,
has been given a shot in the arm
via more urgent vocals, busier
but still concise keyboards and
those wonderful backup vocal-
ists, Lynn Mabry and Ednah

' Holt.

With the Heads’ established
fondness for the rnulti-media
assault, it's not surprising that a
full-color booklet is included
with both the album and
cassette. It is filled with concert
photos and aphorisms such as
”Cats like houses better than
people,” and ”Table manners
are for people who have nothing
better to do.”

David Byrne’s eccentric brand
of humor makes fun of itself,
language and the listener's cul-
tural dogmas all at the same
time. As you can see, this new

nothing more than to be dubbed
”relevant”.

From strained love relation-
ships to the personal, however
predictable, reactions to the idea
of war (no pestilence yet), the
themes are expressed via the
same overbearing tone —
melancholia. Phantoms floats
around the room like a big,
theatening gray cloud, which is

Jerky rhythm. Tedious.

Excluding the AOR fave ”Are
We Ourselves?” (are they?), the
most endearing track is the
punchy, bass-driven ”Less Cit-
ies, More Moving People.” The
intro, which summons up the
image of a sped-up, synth-
embellished theme from a late-
sixties spy film, succeeds at
getting your funkier parts shak-
ing and the repetition of the title
line evolves into‘a sort of spi-
rited anthem. Gets etched on
the brain rather quickly.

The finer points, however
brief and widely spaced, are cap-
tivating, bud the overall feel of
Phantoms is one of contrived
urgency. Phony and shallow.
An oppressive lack of balance.

Public Image Limited

There can be little doubt that
the Sex Pistols’ ultimate self-
destruction was, from the very
start, the only logical conclusion
for a band that stands as one of a
small handful that truly altered
the face of music. Change the
world, then be consumed, by it.

John Lydon, a.k.a. Johnny
Rotten, ‘took another route and,
in due course, formed a ”respec-
table” band — Public Image
Limited. On their own terms,
Public Image has chosen to con-
tinue challenging the musical

mainstream, albeit in a restrict- 7

ed manner. Absent from the
studio for nearly three years
due to personnel changes and
God knows what else, Public
Image has returned, scourging
old ground and throwing in
some new directions for good
measure.

For ‘familiarity’s ‘sake, This Is
What'You Want offers three
songs -that appeared on last
year's Live at Tokyo and, of
‘course, Johnny's inimitably
unsettling whine.‘ Sadly missing
from the project are guitarist
Keith Levine's signature guitar
swipes. Levine left the band
shortly before the recording of
Tokyo, and Lydon, along with
drummer Marty Atkins, mixed
these versions sans guitar.

In spite of Levine's unfortu-
nate impeachment, This Is What
You Want’s funked-up approach
loses little of- the knife’s edge

relentless bottom end of bassist
Louis Bernardi and Atkins pro-

Lydon's vocal invectives. He
remains the world's lone singer
able to make you look over your
shoulder.

First-time studio takes of
”Bad Life" and "This Is Not a
Love Song” are the most imme-
diately, spectacularly grating
songs on the disc; "Love Song,"
in particular, is almost annoying
to the point of rapture. ”Tie Me

strangles the senses with over-

and a demented portrayal of
child abuse, closes side one with

eyes may wish to look away, but

Although much of This Is What

what you get demands

Revival

Pitt to face new;-image Sooners

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

A sheaf of notes reveals there is
more to the face that Oklahoma will
reveal tomorrow afternoon against
Pitt than might otherwise be
thought. Within the past year or so,

questions of credibility and integrity .

have struck right at the heart of
Sooner football. Everything speaks
of status quo now, -but it wasn‘t that

V long ago that the natives of the sun-

baked plains were in arms over head
coach Barry Switzer’s team. ‘
Understand that Switzer replaced
Chuck Fairbanks and his .772 win-
ning percentage in 1973. The pro-
gram never skipped a beat.—After an
undefeated first season and third-
place wire poll finish, the Sooners
raised national championship ﬂags

ﬁrst  

match  

By Bob Travers and

Keith Yannessa
The Pitt News

The Pitt soccer team suffered its
first defeat of the season by drop-
ping a 1-0 decision to St. Vincent’s
Wednesday night in Pitt Stadium. A
Bearcat goal in the waning moments
of the ﬁrst half provided the only
scoring needed to hold on.for'the

‘ win.

“We played poorly, they played
physically," said goalie Dave Tor-
rence. “We just got flustered.”

Defender Andrew Adelman said
the late goal “put pressure on us in
the second half to get it back, but we

- just didn't play well enough to do it.”

The team had trouble getting on
the right track throughout the game,
particularly in the first half when the
Panthers missed several scoring
opportunities.

“We had a lot of missed chances,”
stated Seckin Ablack, a defender.
“We had opportunities, but the ball
just wouldn’t go in for us.” Ablack
added that the visiting squad played
“aggressively; they backed a lot.
That got us more frustrated and we
started trying to play that type of
game, which isn’t our style.”

The aggressive game plan and a
one-goal lead was enough as St. Vin-

cent ‘held off the Pitt attack in the _

second half. The‘ offense never
played together well enough to score
during the first half, and the visitors’
score seemed to flatten Pitt.

“We played tough, but just

Trophy honors in 1978. And —- get
this — OU never lost more than two I
games in a season until the 1982 slate
appeared. Add all that to Switzer’s
107-21-3 record, and there appears
the nation’s winningest coach with
five or more years of combat expe-
rience. It was Mardi Gras time in
Norman during the ’70s.

Ah, but that ’82 year. In a start of
things to come, the Sooners began to
lose four games a «year for the next
two seasons. Unrest began to rear its
ugly head. The reasons are as
numerous as they are speculative.

Players began taking winning for
granted; laziness ensued and disci-
pline wavered. Oklahoma, unable to
recruit effectively enough within a
state of only 2.5 million inhabitants,

could no longer rely on the talented‘

black athletes it recruited from
Texas. The Southwest Conference,
Texas in particular, had, .until the
late ‘60s, long practiced racial
inequality. But then the change
came, and Oklahoma started losing
talented ground.

Then it was revealed two years

ago that Switzer acquired illegal,"

couldn’t finish,” said sophomore
Todd Smith.

Defenseman Uzoma Chibundo, a
senior from Lagos, Nigeria, said, “I
feel bad. We tr_ied to score, but
couldn't. We area better team.“

This loss was particularly disap-

pointing coming as it did on the
heels of a shutout victory over cross-

1

state rival Villanova on Saturday. .

The players,-however, don't feel that
a letdown is in‘ the offing for the
remaining games.

partners. The Securities and
Exchange Commission investigated
but found no hard evidence. Switzer
was acquitted last spring and
required to’ return his share of the
profits. Other topics of interest
include his relations with a female 21
years his junior and arrest in July for
driving while intoxicated.

He was acquitted on that charge,
too, but the discontent peaked last
season when Marcus. Dupree could
tolerate no more. Switzer, in ’82, for-
went the fabled wishbone offense for
the pro-Dupree I-formation. But the
kid had never been ll miles outside
of his hometown, Philadelphia,
Miss. and didn't quite know how to
receive supposed instructions, criti-
cism, etc. He became frustrated, des-
pondent and bolted from OU.

Perhaps the Dupree affair pre-
saged a third straight 8-4 finish.
Mike Treps, OU‘s sports informa-
tion director, thinks so. “We knew

Heon falls short  

of Olympic goals 

By Mitch Vingle
For The Pitt News

(During halftime ceremonies Sat-
urday, the school is two latest Olym-
pians will be honored at Pitt
Stadium. Roger Kingdom won the
gold in the I10-meter high hurdles
and Sue Heon finished fourth in the
400-meter individual medley swim-
ming event.)

When swimmer Tracy Caulkins
won the 400-meter individual med-
ley in the 1984 Summer Olympics,
all of America smiled. It was another
triumph for the U.S. effort.

But the race did not bring rejoic-
ing from the household of David
Belowich. “I was crying," the Pitt
women's swimming coach admitted.

Belowich’s tears fell for Sue Heon,
one of his pupils. Heon was expected
to bring home the silver in the race.
She had sacriﬁced a year of school-
ing to train for the event.

But when the competitors hit the
finish pad, Heon found herself with-
out a medal; she had finished fourth.

After her performance, she burst‘

into tears and ran from the arena.
Now enter the new Sue Heon. “I
thought a lot about the race and I
talked to my coach [Richard Shoul-
berg] about it,"~said the Clarks Sum-
mitt, Pa., native who moved to the
North Hills as a high school junior.
“I swam that race to the best of my
ability. What happened, happened.

I’m still fourth in the world. They

can’t take that away from me. A lot.

of people would give a leg for that.”
Now the race is behind her. She

realizes that qualifying for and com- ' ’

peting in the Olympics isan out-
standing achievement.
future is promising. -

“A lot of people ask me whatl
have to look forward to in swim-
ming," Heon said. “I have other
goals I want to achieve; 1 want to
swim faster. I'm back at Pitt and I

want to become,an All-America"

again. I want to represent Pitt well.”

“She_ has a good perspective of
what she wants to accomplish now,”
Belowich said; “She wants to
become a four-time All-America.
Everything beyond that is gravy.“

If Heon does become a four-time
All-America, she will be in some
heavy company. The only other
Panthers in that esteemed class are
Suzanne Pulley, Hugh Green, Amy
Jackson and Tony Dorsett.
Obviously it takes many hours of
work to reach that plateau.

“It takes a rare individual‘ to
devote themself like she has,” Belo-
wich said. ‘“She trained for s 12
months with one goal in mind. And

there was no assurance that she’d I

make the Games." .
The probability of making the
team decreased dramatically when

Heon came down with a fever and .

sore throat at the trials in

Indianapolis. A . . .
She had qualified for the meet in

five events (the 200- and 400-meter

individual medleys, the 400- and
800-meter freestyles and the 200-
meter backstroke). After making the
U.S. team in the 400-meter individ-
ual medley, Schoulberg withdrew

' Heon from the other events because
of her illness.

“There were no slouches at the
Olympic trials,” he continued.
“Plus, Caulkins was in Heon’s event.
She’s one of the best swimmers ever.
So, instead of two wide open spots,
there was only one.”

Heon nailed the spot, though. Her
time in the 400—meter individual
medley ranked her as the No. 3
swimmer in the world. And East
Germany’s Kathleen Nord, ranked
No. 2, was held out of the Games
because of the __Soviet-led boycott.

Everything was coming up roses.
Until the race.

Belowich recalled his feelings
after the event. “I was crying. I
wanted her to get the silver. I care
about everybody on the team. If I
didn’t, I wouldn't be in this profes-
sion.” ‘

"Heon obviously cares about Belo-
wich and the Pitt swimming pro-
gram. After the one year layoff, she

‘ is returning for her senior year.

“Sue is pretty impressed with
what happened at Pitt last year,”
Belowich continued. “We have had a
very positive change in the program.
We have a bunch of individuals
[who] are hard workers, and Sue is
looking for that.”

Last year, Pitt easily won the Big
East Conference swimming title.
With Heon back in the fold, the
Lady Panthers figure to be
untouchable.

“Her versatility is not limited to
the 400 individual medley,” Belo-
wich said. “She’s a pretty good dis-
tance freestyler and backstroker.
From the team aspect, she solidifies
our roster."

Of course, her absence brought
some tense moments in 1983.

“Obviously I was losing a
swimmer,” Belowich continued.
“And I didn’t know if she was com-
ing back. But once she told me about
her dream, I couldn’t do anything
but support her.” A

The story reminds Belowich of an
old episode of the television sitcom
“Barney Miller."

“This guy had been arrested for
throwing the javelin in Central
Park,” Belowich began. “He was 45
years old and said he was aiming for
the I980 Olympics. He said that if he

The Pitt News;";Friday,,-September;I4;-4984- 4.3   7

Readers — those who pick up
The Pitt News, that is — will
notice last week's preview on that
infamous band of journalistic
nomads, the Gridiron Gurus.
You know, that transient tribe of
college football prognosticators
always on the street digging for
stories when not picking favor-
ites and underdogs.

Well, after some thorough but
quick consideration, we’ve
decided to go with 10 games each
Friday instead of the usual 20.
Along with the saturation of
games on TV every Saturday
morning, afternoon and evening,
we’ve noticed .a similar glut of
weekly games in this space.
Hence the rationale for the 50
percent cutback. Neato, nowit
sounds as if this were some
government agency.

Anyway, nobody wants to
detract from the readership‘s
attention span, so I0 games it is
— I0 interesting ones at that.
Before some information on sev-
eral of those games, nothing is
complete till this week's gurus
are introduced.

In a break from one-year tra-
dition, the no-women-allowed
rule is dead with Lisa Keer
(Alydar) prepared to leave others
in the dust. Another new guru is
WPTS-FM sports director Tom
Walsh (Maestro). Mr. Showbiz,
as in Showcase editor Bryan
Fischer, goes from the top of his
head to give new meaning to
freestyle forecasting. The only
returning member is Mark A.
Sindler, the Grocery Bagger still
smarting from last fall’s Freudi-
an slip regarding a heretofore
new cosmetic breakthrough.
The quick-witted Stan Sav-
ran, part of WTAE-TV and
radio’s Front Four, agreed
(reluctantly or otherwise) to
engage in some unscientiﬁc fore-
casting. as this week's Guest
Guru. Savran is in his fourth year
with WTAE and is beginning his
third term with TCS Sports, an
outfit that produces one-hour
highlight films of Penn State for
those who rise early enough on
Sunday mornings. _ _ 
The feeling here is that Stan
doesn’t; probably tape delays

On to the games. Miami’s
headed for its fourth straight
road game, against Purdue, after
the Boilermakers upset Notre
Dame last week. The Irish, in
turn, hit the road for the second
straight week, looking to avenge
last season's home loss to Michi-
gan State, coached by former
Steeler assistant George Perles.
Creampuff game of the week:
Lou Holtz, the new coach in the
northern timberland, admits his
Minnesota Golden Gophers
shouldn’t even play Nebraska.
Maybe he can take heart in
knowing the Cornhuskers no
longer have Rozier, Gill and
Fryar. Some folks wondered
whether Arizona State's home
game against Southern Cal was a
day or evening contest. Huh?
What happened to such queries
as, Which school’s cheerleading
unit has the most blondes?”

Sooners tuned up for Pitt

After picking up 13 tack-
les against Stanford last
Saturday, OU defensive
end Kevin Murphy will
play opposite Pitt’s Bill
Fralic in tomorrow's
game. Last year Murphy
completed 144 tackles.

continued from page ﬁfteen

we had problems with Marcus. They
came to a head right before the
Texas game. It's hard for me to tell
you what that’s like, nothing similar
to Pitt-Penn State or Ohio State-
Michigan. Every year the country’s
largest state fair is held in Dallas.
The game is onlTV and everyone
gets very emotional.

“Then Marcus left. We had to
switch Spencer Tillman from half-
back to tailback. Everyone [in the

‘sports media] across the country

wanted to know about Dupree to the
point that Barry almost didn’t real-
ize there was a game that weekend.”

But OU is starting to dig for that
Mardi Gras euphoria. The wishbone
is back, though Tillman will likely
not play against Pitt tomorrow. Dis-
cipline has been tightened; a drug
education program is operating;
goals not only include winning, but
defeating the oft-elusive Top 20
teams; and, interestingly, players
now have access to a ﬂotation think

tank. Floating in a saline solution, '.

players supposedly attain a state of

unparalleled mental relaxation._

Therapeutic uses are said to be
unlimited.

Still left-unsaid, however, is OU’s
ability to once again get it together
on the field. _ V

0?!!!

In their 19-7 victory over Stanford
last weekend, the Sooners at some

V points employed ﬁve or six defensive

backs. “We didn't know what we
had before the season,” Switzer said.

ittti

Switzer would not say whether
OU currently has anyone of ability
equal to that of Keith Gary, a former
OU» defensive lineman now with the
Steelers. “We started six freshmen
[defensively]. so we‘re very young,
very inexperienced. But our nose-
guard [6-3, 272-pound Tony Casi]-
las] and [end Kevin] Murphy are
two of . theggreat football players
today.” » -

##3##

/

Head coach Foge Fazio seemed.
satisfied with the Panthers’ progress
during last week's open date. Ev-

' eryone on defense is healthy, except

for end Chris Doleman, who has a
sprained ankle. Senior end Bill
Sapio will start his second straight
game and junior Bob Schilken will
probably replace Doleman. Guard
Mike Dorundo has recovered from a

V pulled calf muscle, freeing junior

_Dave Grillo from offensive duty-to
long snap duty for punts.
