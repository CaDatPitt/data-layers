Profs Discuss

China Bomb,

Soviet Ouster

By NANCY DELANEY
The outster of Soviet Pre-
mier Nikita Khrushchev
Thursday was not only unex-
pected by Western observers,
but also completely unrelated
to the Chinese nuclear ex-
plosion which occurred the
next day, a panel of Univer-
sity experts in Soviet and

Chinese affairs contend.

The ﬁve experts explained
at a press conference late
Friday afternoon that the
explosion of one bomb that
morning did not make .a nuclear
power of China, which has neith-
er a nuclear armory, nor missles
capable of delivering nuclear
bombs. -The explosion did have
great propaganda effect, though
they agreed.

Although it is not safe to as-
sume that the two men who re-
place Khruschev will be “Com-
munists in grey ﬂannel suits,” it
is likely, according to the panel,
that they will be less militant
than Chinese Communist leaders
and more dedicated to Soviet
welfare than to Communist goals.

Experts Listed _

The members of the panel were
Dr. Cole Blasier, director of the
University's Center for Latin
American studies; Irwin Schul-
man, political science instructor
whose major ﬁeld of -study is
Chinese politics; Allen Pollack,
instructor in Soviet and Russian
history; James Roberts, instruc-
tor in political science, specializ-
ing in Soviet foreign policy; and
Dr. Carl Beck, associate profes-
sor of political science, who has
made extensive studies of the
Soviet bloc.

None of the ﬁve foresees the
new two-man rule in the So-
viet Union as permanent; they
expect one man to emerge
strongest, as has always hap-
pened before. Although the de-
cision to remove Khrushchev
was probably unanimous among
top Soviet officials, it is like-
ly that the choice of a successor
is not nearly so unanimous, the
five experts conjectured.

Causes of Dissatisfaction

Not only was the growing rift
with Communist China one cause
of dissatisfaction, but Khrush-
chev may also have been severe-
ly criticized for diverting re-
sources from heavy industry to
agriculture and consumer pro-
duction, Roberts suggested. Pol-
lack pointed out, however, that
the possibly more powerful of
Khrushchev’s two successors,
Leonid Brezhnev, has traditional-
13’ been associated with develop-
ment of consumer industry.

The entire panel agreed
that the two leaders, who are the
ﬁrst Soviet rulers to have had
no real revolutionary experience,
constitute a “new generation” and
a “new look” in Soviet leader-
ship, although they could not con-
jecture what impact this would
have. The reactions of the Soviet
rulers will be highly affected by
the world situation, though, the
Panel agreed. - . - » »

Young Republicians Find
Paradox of Registration
In Pittsburgh City Area

People who don’t exist may be voting in Alle-
gheny County. Bill Valentine, head of the Pitt
Young Republicans, said that his group discovered
the paradox during a recent check on voter regis-
tration in the Hotmewood-Brushton area.

Said Valentine, “We found 430 persons who were
registered to vote who no longer lived in the area.
They were either dead or living in vacant lots and
all but a few of the 430 were registered as Demo-
crats.

“To be registered,” he continued, “a person must

- have voted in the last two years. In other words,

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN
Dr. Carl-Christoph Schweitzer, profes-

ﬁned the subject of his Midday Series speech-

The legal position taken by the Germans

frontiers of 1937 has not ceased to exist,
Dr. Schweitzer, who teaches at the Free
University and the Teachers University,

in abeyance.”

The preamble of the 1949 constitution
of the federal republic stated the three main
aims of Germany's foreign policy as peace, the re-
uniﬁcation of Germany, .and a uniﬁcation of Euro.
pean nations. Dr. Schweitzer emphasized that these
aims are equal in signiﬁcance, but said that prior-
it)’. if granted, would be for reuniﬁcation. Although '
there is no possibility at the moment for the achieve-
ment of this goal, Dr. Schweitzer maintained that
the German people must only hope that time will
change the present situation.

Problem Subdivided

Dr. Schweitzer divided the problem of two Ger-
manys into four subdivisions: the humanitarian and
moral, historical, legal and political.

After prefacing his remarks by stating that the
humanitarian aspect is adequately emphasized in
this country, Dr. Schweitzer proceeded to the his-
torical angle. He traced the background of the
problem of division to the wartime conferences
of the Allied powers at Yalta and Potsdam, stress-
ing that the whole idea of these agreements was
“to administer Germany as a whole.”

Dr. Schweitzer pointed out that the declaration
of June 5, 1945, gave‘ the Allied commanders su-
preme authority to jointly administer Germany. The
original intention, he said, was not to divide Ger-
many. But these agreements were not observed; the
“cold war” originated; and jointadministration was
abandoned.

University Theatre
Presents Shakespeare
Classic November 5

The University Theater will present Measure for Meas-
ure beginning November 5 as the ﬁnal production in the
celebration of the quadricentennial anniversary of William
Shakespeare.

- A The play will run consecutively through November
14 at the Stephen Foster Memorial with only the Novem-
ber 8 performance omitted.

For the ﬁrst time in two years admission will be charged to
the Pitt Players production.

According to Ralph G. Allen, director of the University Theatre,
“It became clear that increased complexity of the University Theatre
program, which includes six full-length productions this year in-
stead of three, could not be supported entirely by the generous al-
locations from the Division of Humanities.” The Pitt Players-Univer-
sity Theater is underwritten entirely by the Office of Academic Dis-
ciplines. The Theater program, therefore, receives no part of the
Student Activitives fee.

Bitter Comedy

Dr. Allen describes Measure for Measure as “a bitter comedy
about the nature of justice” and he believes that recent enthusiasm
stems from the world view of humor and pain as in some sense
identical.

Production design came from Philip R. Eek, professor of“
speech, and Colin 0. Sterne, associate professor of music, wrote
an original musical score.

The cast of 34 comprises the largest in the history of the four-
year-old theater. Richard Galuppi, guest-artist who played Tartuﬁe,
Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night, and Claudius in Hamlet at the
Pittsburgh Playhouse ,heads the cast.

Players Listed
Players are Barbara Lyons, a sophomore who played Laura in
A House with Two Doors Is Difficult to Guard; Harvey Miller, a
graduate student who played Minelaus in lastvwinter’s Iphigenia in
Aulis; Daniel Frezza, dental student; Forest Sears, graduate student

_ and formerly of the Yale Drama School; Frank Maraden, junior;

lMistake Causes

Student Trouble

Editor, The Pitt News:

A very confusing and annoy-
ing set of circumstances has re-
sulted from the caption under
my picture in The Pitt News of
October 16 which stated, “Ivan
Gold_ questioned whether a stu-
dent who cheated in a required
course unrelated to his major

' . . . was harming anyone.” Moth-

ers everywhere are teaching their
children to taunt me on the
streets, dogs nip at my heels

._ wherever I go, the John Birch

Society has me on their black-

list and I am about to be sub-

poenaed by the HUAC.
Therefore I would like to re-

_ quest a correction of Miss Ep-

stein’s article on the panel dis-
cussion of academic dishonesty.

At no time did I imply that, “a *
; pre-law student who cheats on a
: physics’ test is not hurting any-
» one.” One of the panel members
7 said, and I agree with him, that j
: a cheaters hurts everyone con-
. nected with his cheating.

. He hurts himself because he is

‘." refusing himself the very educa-
¥_ tion that he came to the Univer-
» sity for. He hurts his classmate

because the results of his dis-

’ honesty artiﬁcially inﬂuence the
- curve on which the class’ grades
" are’ based. And ﬁnally, he hurts

the University because any class-
room dishonesty thwarts the aca-
demic and ideological aims of any
educational institution.

What I did say was that the
feeling of, “I’m not hurting any-
one when I cheat,” is a prevalent

belief among the student body. I '
believe (and I said) that this
feeling is the major cause of
academic dishonesty —-_- not only
at Pitt, but at most other schools.
I did not offer a solution to the
problem, nor did I in any way
condone it or attempt to ration-
alize it into acceptability.

I merely stated that the prob-
lem exists and presented what I
thought was its basis. To print
that I felt that a cheater was
hurting no one -— least of all
himself — was a ridiculous mis-
interpretation of my statement. '

GOP Statement

Editor, The Pitt News:

"I was very pleased to ﬁnd the» '
L letter of Bill Valentine (“Gold-

waterite Claims Pride in GOP
Group”) in The Pitt News (Octo-

ing that the GOP was running a

at ease.

For after reading a pamphlet
circulated at the Goldwater rally
(October 3) entitled “H. H. H.’.’ —I
really had some doubts — but I
guess they must have been cir-
culated by some “secret com-

Sex and  Oiollege (Whirl  

 
   
  

Last week the editor and feature editor of this paper appeared on “Contact,”
a KDKA radio program hosted by Mike Levine, where guests, from political personal-
ities to college coeds, are interviewed as to their viewpoint in a certain area and then
challenged by listeners who phone in during the hour.

This particular interview was prompted by a column the feature editor had writ-
ten on a recent near-panty-raid, i‘n which she advocated not the raid itself but the fact
that it symbolized a youthful spirit she had thought gone from such a blase campus.
The KDKA personnel immediately picked up’ on the idea of interviewing such “out-
spoken” University coeds and assured them that they would be questioned on such
things as civil rights and the prevalence of motor scooters on campus.

The girls were quite disturbed, therefore, when they walked into the studio and
saw a copy of Gael Greene’s Sex and the College Girl by the microphones. Again they
Were assured that sex would be used only as an opening “teaser” on the show just to
get the audience’s attention. Then, of course, everyone would call in on civil rights.

The girls then assured the producer that they would get calls on nothing but
sex, but Mike Levine sloughed that off and proceeded to tell them exactly what to say.
The coeds found this approach curious considering that they had been asked for “out-
spoken comments,” and found it even _more interesting as they got into the show and
found not only all the questions directed towards sex, as they had expected, but that all
of their answers were either cut short or interpreted so that is seemed they, as typcial
college coeds, thought of nothing else. ‘

After the show they faced an irate peer group back at school. Numerous indi-
viduals had tried to call in to steer the discussion back to politics, for most of the stu-
dents, if not the general public, had seen the show as stacked to present this genera-
tion as a fantastically wild, avant garde crew, who regard the Peace Corps as a fine

way to ﬁnd out “how they do it” in Venezuela.

We realize that this is show bizand that there is still a superﬁicially Puritan-

ical element of American soci'ety who think it is evil for the word “sex” even to be
mentioned before marriage. But the harder this experience was to swallow-, all the
more precious this collegiate ivory tower became and that all too short freedom to

be idealists.

How The Other Half Lives

Adventures of A Secretary

By NANCY FUCHS
A secretary is a “Jill of
all trades)’. I -used to think

. that the job of _a secretary

required nothing more than
a . quick, accurate touch on
the typewriter, an imper-

' sonaL bust
,ness-like air,
and a pair
 of hi‘gh-heel-
"'3? ed shoes. It

 ed to me that
the job could
be challeng-
ing. However,
a ft e r t w o
m o n t h s o f
‘ working as a
secretary, I learned that it
required more than most
people expect and. that it
was a real challenge to meet
the demands of the job.

The requirements of the
job are manifold. A secre-
tary is a woman who can
frighten away salesmen;
matter-of-factly tell a phone
caller “The boss is not in
and I don't expect him back
today,” when the boss is
standing right beside her;
and humor the boss after
he loses a big contract or
can't find a folder in the
file. It is also a real skill
for a secretary to be able
to appear busy when she
has completed her work
early. There is a limit to
how many times she can
dust the office, re-arrange
the ﬁle, but she must go
about these little jobs as if
she was just too busy to do
it before.

‘THE TECHNIQUE of
using the telephone is one
which the secretary must
‘perfect. It never failed that
the phone wouldremain si-
lent for an hour and then
all three lines would ring.

 
  

never occurr-

  

at once. Sometimes I forgot
who was on which line, and
to my -chagrin my boss would
tell me ot say that he was
“not in” to “one of the call-
ers (a creditor of a com-
pany whose bid wasn’t ready
yet) and I could not remem-
ber which _line he was on.
Long-distance calls -that I
had to dial direct made me
especially nervous. Many i's
the time that I disconnect-
ed the party in my eager-

. ness to call" the boss to the

phone.

‘Another difficulty with
the telephone was a busi-
ness who would call my boss
but would talk to me for
ﬁve minutes or so before
asking for him. Once he was
talking to me and his secre-
tary cut in to tell him that
my boss was on the other
line. While he was talking
to me, my boss had called
him!

AT TIMES circumstanc-
es invest a secretary with
strange duties. When I start-
ed working, I was not a
good typist and had to type
quotations over as many as
two or three times. The
wastebasket ﬁlled up fast,
and I was forced to empty
it myself so that my mis-
takes would not serve as
evidence against me.

Once I was alone in the
office when a truck driver
backed up his truck into the
garage to deliver several
long steel monorails. The
driver was so preoccupied
with .watching the rear of
the truck that he didn’t see
the side of the truck touch
the wall, and the side-view
mirror hit the side of‘ the
garage and shattered all
over the floor. The driver
pursedhis lips and drove
off without a word, leaving

me 3‘-Q find a broom.

 

A secretary must learn
not to be a slave to curios-
ity. She has to realize that
it _may be safer to go on
living without learning what
that “thingamajig” on the
desk is. On my ﬁrst day at
the job, I picked up a white
porcelain object and tilted
it over to see what it was.

I discovered it was a stamp .

moistener as the water tric-
kled over my hand onto the
carbon paper lying on the
desk. The ink from the car-
bon paper ran all over my
good white paper and the
"desk top, and everything
stuck together. A few weeks
later, none the wiser for my
experience, I picked up an-
other object and tried to
investigate its properties.
After breaking the spring
and scattering the parts all
over the floor, I discovered
it was a little scale for
weighing letters.

A SECRETARY has to be
able to ﬁnd satisfaction in lit-
tle things. I used to feel espe-
cially happy when the stack
of completed letters mount-
ed up on my desk. It was a
good day if I had ten enve-
lopes and packages to mail,
and a bad day if only three
or four.

As a typical college stu-
dent I used to look down on
the job of secretary. Two
months on the other side of
the fence showed me how
mistaken I was. The job re-
quires a myriad of talents,
and although the require-
ments may differ from those

" of a" teacher or other pro-

fessional, they are just as

«stiff -in their own right. 3

Authors and Publishers.

By WAYNE CLAEREN
The success of One Potato, Two Potato is due to

 the controversial subject matter of the film, not to its
 dramatic or technical excellence. While inteligent movie-

goers, especially outside this country, are pleased to see

 a meaningful American film dealing with race relations,
"  they cannot help but recognize a poor script and careless

photography.

One Potato, Two Potato not only deals with a
delicate problem of our time, but also takes a ﬁrm
point of view. The screen-play, however, becomes
a sermon instead of a story, and the “message”
becomes more important than the characters.

The cast is unquestionably good, but one ap-
preciates their searching attempts to overcome a
preachy, unnatural script, rather than their involve-
ment in a believable situation. Barbara Barrie
comes closer than anyone in making the story
signiﬁcant. She received the best actress award
at the Cannes Film Festival, which indicates an exceptional per-

CLAEREN

' formance, especially considering the script with which she had to
work.

A Screen Play Poor
Bernie Hamilton and Richard Mulligan are both good actors but
the screen play is not properly developed for either to adequately

’ . express his difficult situation. Each plays .a man challenged by a

man of a different race for the love of a woman .and a child.
Mention must be made of a near perfect performance by
Robert Earl Jones. The secondary characters, in general, are

more successfully drawn and less burdened than the principles,
and Jones is truly excellent. In his role of a father-in-law whose
prejudice is overcome by love, he is able to bring sensitive in-
terpretation and clear portrayal which is seen only seldom on
the screen.

Since the success of “Marty” several years ago, Americans have
been conditioned’ to believe that any ‘‘low budget" movie with a
serious theme is automatically great. But though simplicity and
creativity more than compensate for unlimited funds, a minimum of
cost does not always signify a maximum of skill. In One Potato, Two
Potato the direction, camera work, and lighting constantly remind
the audience that a ﬁhn is being made. The realism is painful be-
cause it is not real.

Uninspired Technique

If the subject matter were not, as the advertisement reads, “one
of the hotter topics of our time,” the uninspired technique and poor
screen play would completely overshadow the excellent attempts of
the cast. Feeling for the subject, however, overcomes feeling for
dramatic quality in too many cases. Some are pleased because they
are sympathetic with the picture’s message. Some are angered be-
cause they disagree sharply with it.

Nevertheless, overemphasis on ethics always detracts from
emotional and intellectual involvement in a ﬁlm or a play. As
for the ethics involved in this case, reason and mature action and
discussion, not pity and sentimentality, are the weapons with
which to defeat bigotry, stupidity and hatred. The problem of
making a good film and the far more important question of
rational and wise race relations both require intelligence and
dedication to the truth, not emotional and comercial emphasis.

PEOPLE WHO SAW the football game in Miami Satur-
day night were surprised to ﬁnd the Hurricanes leading

in the waning moments of the game. One fan who
saw the game commented afterwards, “This team
stinks,” referring to the Panthers.

Although the Panthers did not have a good rec-
ord (2-2) when they went to Miami, theyiwere a
highly regarded football power. Although they had
made mistakes against Oregon and UCLA, people
were able to shrug them off, or blame the mistakes
on inexperience or bad breaks. More than once we
heard people say, “With a little bit of luck they could
have been undefeated.

THE MIAMI HURRICANES are a- weak football team.
No one argues that point. They are weak offensively, yet

they scored 20 points against the Panthers. Of course,

"if Miami had been lucky, the Panthers might not

have scored that third touchdown. But Eric Crab-
tree’s skill overcame any luck the Hurricanes had on
their side.

But only for the moment. Jim Jones missed the
extra point.

THE PANTHERS HAVE now completed the easy part
of their schedule. In their next five games they play

Navy, Syracuse, Notre Dame, Army and Penn State.
Navy, Army and Penn State are weaker than pre-
season predictions indicated. Syracuse was expected to
be strong, and Notre Dame might be the best team in
the country.

The last two football games seem to indicate
that if Mazurek can be stopped, the Panthers can
be stopped. More and more, the defense is beginning
to key to the Panther all-America candidate. This
keying on Mazurek should make Eric Crabtree, Dale
Stewart, and either Jim Flanigan or Barry McKnight
that much more effective.

Defenses have been keying on Mazurek. Miami
used a defense that kept their halfbacks fairly close
to the line, leaving the long pass open. But Mazurek
did not stay in his pocket to throw the long pass.

THE PANTHERS HAVE a good offense, but in their
‘ next”ﬁ‘ve' games they will meet two of the strongest teams

in the country, Notre Dame. and Syracuse. When the
Fighting Irish come in here on November 7, it could
be a very long afternoon for the Panthers.

And the Orangemen have three of the best run-
ning backs in the country in halfback Floyd Little,

quarterback Wally Mahle, and fullback Jim Nance. -

The Panthers had trouble containing a Mahle-like
quarterback, Bob Biletnikoff, in the Orange bowl Sat-
urday. What happens next Saturday might not be

too pretty either.

By FRANK smzm

The ﬁrst half of the sea-
son is now over and the Pan-
thers have survived with a
2-2-1 record. The second ﬁve
games will be a lot tougher.
If‘ past performances mean
anything. The Panthers will face
four Eastern Powers and unde-
feated Notre Dame.

Fred Mazurek had his worst
night of the season against Mi-
ami as defensive end Ed Weisa-
cosky pursued him all night. “The
line was missing blocking assign-
ments and Miami really played
an inspired ghme,” Michelosen
said.

Miami used a tight defense,
keeping all their safety men
close to the line of scrimmage
guarding against the rollout of
Mazurek. Twice Pitt tried long

halfback passes to counteract the‘

umbrella type defense but both.
times the passes were thrown
short.

Other teams facing the Pan-
thers this season may try this
type of defense. Michelosen,
however, isn't worried over the
success of Miami. “Miami had
the type of personnel that could
do the job, not every team can
use that type of line-up. It’s
the men not the type of de-
fense that makes something
work.”

The biggest problem the Pan-
thers had was stopping the Mi-
ami backs on punt returns and
kickoff returns. Miami was al-
ways at least as far their own 45
yard line after a kickoff or .a

punt. This posed-Ea‘ problem for~if —-

Pitt held Miami-‘they still had to
start deep in their own territory
after a punt.

Hurricane back Any Sixkiller
returned a punt 71 yards for the
ﬁrst  score. “That was the
play on which Bi11_ Howley got

in agony when the back ran right

Eye NCAA Berth

Boaters Face Grove

BILL CABIN

Grove City Ptses a strong
threat to the soccer team's
hopes for an NCAA berth,
when the booters play at
Grove City at 3 :30 p.m. Fri‘-
day. After their key win
over Howard last Saturday, the
booters are now 4-1, while the
Wolverines hold a 4-0 mark.

“Grove City will be every bit
as tough as Howard,” said coach
Leo Bemis. ‘‘They’ve got the same
team as last year plus three good
freshmen.” Last year the booters
defeated the Wolverines 2-0 in a
double overtime.

Freshman coach Bob McNulty
agreed, “They only needed a lit-
tle more polish last year and
have practically the same team
back.”

Wolverine coach Cliff Wettig
feels he has added polish to
his team with the recruitment
‘of three freshmen, who have
earned starting positions. “Scott
Gay, Jim and John Pontier
have made an outstanding start
this season,” said Wettig.

Jim Pontier and his twin
brother, John, are from Franklin
Lakes, New Jersey, and are the

starting right wing and inside

right,
hails from M.ilmont Park, Pa.,
starts at inside left, and is the
Wolverines’ leading scorer. A
The Pontier brothers and Gay
have tallied 47 per cent of Grove
City's goals, netting eight goals
between them.
While the Panthers are in
the NOCA big college division,
the Wolverines are a small col-
lege independent. They are
therefore allowed to start fresh-
men, and participate in either
the NAIA touranment or the
NCAA small college tournament.
A win over the Grovers will
still net the booters valuable
Saylor points. They were a “B”
team last year, and appear head-
ed for a good season, outscoring
their opposition 17-3 to date.
Last week, however, the Wol-
verines only beat Frostburg State,
2-0, while the P.anthers upended
Frostburg, 7-2, in their opener.
“They’ll be up for us,” said
Bemis, “because we're the only
big name school on their sched-
ule, and it's also their Home-
coming week-end. Their ﬁeld
may also present a problem, be-
cause it's 20 ‘yards shorter than
a regulation ﬁeld and some-
what narrower.

respectively; Gay, who.

We’ll have to cut them off at
mid-ﬁeld, and with the improved
play that our linemen and half-
backs have been showing, we
should be able to do it.”

Boot Coach Bob McNulty
Builds Winning Tradition

By BILL CABIN
Building a winning tradi-
tion is not an easy task, but
it's the goal of freshman
soccer coach Bob McNulty.

McNulty, a 26-year-old na-
tive of Pittsburgh’s Home-
wood district, became freshman
coach in 1962 and has compiled
an 11-2 record to date.

“When I took the job,” said
McNulty, “the ﬁrst thing I told
the boys was that I wanted to
build a winning tradition here. I
tried to instill in them the idea
of ﬁerce competition.”

McNulty’s desire to build a
winning tradition is a product of
his own athletic experience at
Westinghouse High School, where
he lettered three years in swim-
ming and one year in football.
Westinghouse has won 105 of
their 109 city - league football
games.

“We always had a winning
tradition at Westinghouse,” said
McNulty. “When a boy joined
a team there, he knew he had
something to uphold, and that
made a big diiferencrduring a
season. Pitt had no such tradi-
tion in soccer, and I became
determined to help establish
it.”

McNulty had no soccer experi-
ence until he entered his sopho-
mbre year. “I ﬁrst met Bob in
1958 when he was one of my
students,” said coach Leo Bemis.
“He was a physical education ma-
jor and he did well in a soccer
course, so I asked him to come
out for the team.

“Soccer was only in its ﬁfth
year as a varsity sport, and I
often recruited players from gym
classes. In fact, we only had a
3-7 record that year, but I got
McNulty and George Zanicopou-
los from a gym class.” Both Mc-
Nulty and Zanicopoulos lettered
three years, and Zanicopoulos
won all-district and all-America
honors.

“I enjoyed soccer,” said Mc-
Nulty, “and it became a challenge
to me. 1” was green my ﬁrst year,
but guys like Bill Eisinger and
Ron Wyatt helped break me in
and give me conﬁdence.

“After I played soccer and got
my physical education degree, I

coach, has compiled an 11-2 record. This year’s frosh are 1-2, con-
trasting with the undefeated records of the past two teams.

knew I wanted to coach soccer.
So I told Bemis that I wanted to
stay and help after graduation."

Bill Summers, a member of the
athletic department had coached
the frosh in 1961, but left later
that year for a job at Columbia.
“I knew McNulty was available,”
said Bemis, “and since he was a
physical education major and
had played here, I asked him to
coach the freshmen.”

“I was really surprised,” said
McNulty, “because I never ex-
pected to get a coaching position
so soon. I consider myself fortu-
nate.”

Now in his third year as frosh
coach, McNulty feels he is mak-

‘ing progress in building a win-

ning tradition by emphasizing
the importance of conditioning
and talking.

“My idea is to go with con-

The freshman soccer team aims

Varsity today at 3:30 p.m. at
Kennard Field. The frosh won
their opener against Frostburg
and have dropped games to the
Slippery Rock and West Virginia
Junior Varsities.

“I’m looking forward to Slip-
pery Rock,” said frosh coach Bob
McNulty. “It was a tough loss to
them at Slippery Rock, but they
were able to slip a couple of drib-
blers in. I think we've got a
good shot at them."

ditioning ﬁrst,” he said. ‘‘There’s
no use in knowing what to do
with the ball if you can’t get
to it. Skills are secondary to
conditioning, when I practice
with the frosh.”

McNulty also stresses talking.
“I c_onsider talking a part of spir-
it. If you don’t talk, you don’t
know what’s happening. I try to
instill it in them, and hope that
it will continue on to the varsity.

“It worked with last year’s
team. They had drive and a tre-
mendous desire to win, which
they carried on to the varsity
this year. Actually, the varsity
is the same as last year except
for the inﬂux of sophomores.

With his teaching experience,
soccer ability, and lust for win-
ning, Bob McNulty seems to have
a bright -future.

Cub Signal Caller

Accepts Challenge

By TOM SACKS_

Freshman quarterback Mike Elliott sacrificed a pos-
sibility of becoming a star in his native state of Arizona
by hinging his football hopes on a career here.

Elliott accepted a scholarship here despite the pres-
sures of Arizona and other western schools knowing full
well that he might be paying in the shadow of highly
publicized Bob Bazylak, a high-school all-American from

McKeesport, Pa.

“I knew that I had my work
cut out for me,” said Elliott,
“but I also realized that most
colleges give everybody a pretty
equal chance in freshman ball,
otherwise they wouldn’t have
any idea what a person could
do.”

“Besides I always had the ink-
ling to come back East to school.
I’m originally from Philadelphia.
We moved to Arizona when I was
eight.”

In the cub game with West
Virginia, Elliott watched Bazylak
lead the team to an 8-7 victory.
Last week, in the losing battle,
50-20, to Kent State, Elliott found
himself replacing Bazylak, who
had trouble sustaining any scor-
ing momentum.

He completed eight passes in

13 attempts for 110 yards and

ﬁgured in all three Cub scores,

passing for two and running
one.

E1liott’s high school team in

Mesa, Arizona, compiled .an 11-0

record and captured the state
championship last year. During

A the season, he attempted only 40

passes but completed 35 of them.

Elliott, a roll-out specialist,
doesn’t give much credit to the
belief that a roll-out artist in
college won’t stick in pocket
oriented pro ball. “A good quar-
terback can adjust to both. In
college it gives the defense four
runners to watch instead of
three.” To back up his beliefs,
Elliott gained 74 y.ards rushing
on seven attempts.

Phi Ep Beats Public Health 6'-5;
Wins All Campus Softball Title

By GEORGE LIES

Phi Epsilon Pi earned the
All Campus Softball Cham-
pionship by winning both
games of a double-header
playoff last Saturday-

Public Health, the Inde-

pendent Champ, defeated the
Dorm ﬂnalist, Keystone, 9-7, and
Phi Ep downed Pi Kappa Alpha,
11-6, in ﬁrst round games. In the
afternoon contests Pika evened
its record with a 12-6 victory
over Keystone; Phi Ep edged
Public Health, 6-5.

Pi Kappa Alapha couldn’t put
together their 12 hits to score
more than Phi Epsilon Pi. Losing
pitcher Greg Denis allowed only
10 hits, including a home run by
Bob Goodman. Don Sweeny hit
one for Pika. Dick Hurwitz pick-
ed up the win.

Wayne Walker hit: a home
run with a man on base in the
last inning to give Public
Health the win over Keystone.
The game was close all the way
with Public Health out-hitting
Keystone, 12 to 9. Skip Cole-
man won another while Rich
Kaplan took the defeat. Greg
Schultz hit a home run in a
losing cause.

Public Hea1th’s Coleman, after
winning ﬁve consecutive games,
lost to Phi Ep, 6-5. Winning pitch-
er Hurwitz gained his second vic-
tory of the day. Bob Goodman
hit a home run in this one also.
Public Health was» at a disadvan-
tage because they lacked a couple
of regulars.

Pika beat Keystone, 12-6, in the
1oser’s bracket. Greg Denis won
his third contest against two
losses. Jim Dolnik was the los-
ing pitcher.

New Beginning for Clubs

Students and Faculty Take New
Initiative to Get Affairs Going

Students and faculty have the initia-
tive in getting the student affairs program
off the ground at the Bradford campus.
The school’s second year was almost a new be-
ginning for clubs since most out-of-town students
were living in scattered housing.

The new dorms have brought students to-

gether under "one roof and clubs are much easier
to organize this year. The faculty has acted in
an advisory role to most of the new organizations.

Bradford is surrounded by ski-slopes in the
winter and the Ski Club is the fastest growing
student organization on campus. The club has 70

the Seneca Highlands the membership is expect-
ed to increase.

Club president is Hardie Collins, a Canadian
student who learned to ski when he was seven.
The club's purpose is to provide cheap trans-
portation, reduced ski rentals and tow charges
and to arrange accommodations for several week-
end trips this winter. Collins also hopes to pro-

vide instruction, especially for novices.

A Glee Club and Debate Club, both sponsored
by M. Clayton Weathersby, instructor in speech,
have begun their season this fall. The Glee Club
has 45 members and meets every Wednesday
night at Hamsher House. The club has plans for
a public concert in the band shell of Bradford’s
Veteran’s Memorial Square during the Christmas
holidays.

Debate is small but active with two members
currently debating. Two sophomores, Steve
George and Charles Lind are preparing their
case for competition in the University’s annual
Cross-Exam Tournament at the Oakland campus
in December. -

A riﬂe team is also preparing for intercol-
legiate competition. The group, sponsored by
Ralph K. Smith, physical education instructor, is
now composed of ten experienced shooters. Plans
also include instruction.

David Detzer, history instructor, has formed
a’ chess club. The ten players meet monthly to
compete against each other. The last meet was

Bradford Doubles 1

Students, Buildings

The Bradford Campus of University of Pittsburgh‘

has more than doubled its enrollment as it starts it sec-
ond year.

Present full-time student enrollment is 380 and an evening school
of 100. Two other regionals, Greensburg and Titusville, were also
founded last year and have enrollments of 142 and 137, respectively.

The enrollment at Bradford is now more than twice the size of
last year's freshman class of 140. The rapid increase has required
the opening of the new dormitory, Emery Hall. Even this facility
has overﬂowed into last year's dorm, Interstate House, and into the
Bradford YMCA.

With classroom space at a premium the former faculty offices
at Hamsher House, the main classroom building, have been pressed
into service.

The faculty has expanded to meet the new demands. Bradford

has 23 full-time faculty members. In addition there are three part- i

time instructors for the day school and four for the evening school.

Bradford is the second largest of the regional campuses. The
largest is Johnstown College which was founded as a regional cen-
ter 35 years ago. Johnstown has nearly 1,000 students.

Expand Emery Hall.

The University at Bradford will soon open a coffee

_shop and book center in Emery Hall, the campus’ new

dormitory and student union. The new facilities will serve
both the student body and the general community. A

former hotel, the Emery also provide food service and fa- »

culty offices.

Scheduled to open in the ﬁrst part of November, the coffee shop
will serve up to 70 patrons seven days a week. The new facility ac-
tually is a remodeled version of the former hotel coffee shop which
served Bradford customers for 40 years before the Emery Hotel was
converted to a “co-ed” dormitory in September.

The restaurant will be served by the same kitchen as the Emery

Hall student dining rooms.

hoped this would happen in the
next ﬁve years.

Some unofficial interscholastic
competition in sandlot tackle
football between a freshman
team from the dorms and the
varsity team from Bradford High

dorm freshmen won the latest
