DEBATERS wm
ovuz COLGATE;
LOSE TO BUFFALO

Meeting Colgate University in ‘a
neutral-ground debate at Erie, Pa., and
Buffalo University at Buffalo, N. Y.,
the Pitt debating team last week
achieved varied success, losing to the
latter on March 28, and defeating the
former on March 29. Thesubject de-
bated was, “Resolved that the United
States should cancel the Allied war
debts,” although the wording was
slightly different in the Colgate de-
bate. Pitt in each case upheld the
afﬁrmative. The team was composed
of Chauncey E. Pruger, Eleazor Levy
and George W, Davis, with Anthony
W. Smith, -III., as alternate, and was
accompanied by Charles R. Foster, Jr.,

’ who acted as manager.

The debate with Colgate was held
in the Central High School audito-
rium at Erie on Thursday before a
large audience: The Colgate team was
‘composed of'Paul E. Sutorius, John E.
Colgan,-and William’ F. Davison. The
judges were Rev. 0. C. Horsman, pas-
tor of the First Baptist Church, Hen-
ry Park, Judge of Erie County, and
C. W. McNary, principal of the Acad-
emy High. School. ‘Superintendent
John ‘C. Diehl presided. The decision
was 2-1 in favor of the University of
Pittsburgh.

The Pittsburgh team showed that
cancellation. is necessary to the re-
covery of Europe, for the prosperity
of America, for the preservation of
peace, and as a moral duty. The ‘Col-
gate debaters based their case upon
the propositions that cancellation is
unnecessary, that Europe can pay,
and that the United States is morally

lar semi-monthly meeting in Zoology
Hall at 8 o’clock Thursday evening,
March 17.

Mr. L. A. Brown of the Department
of Zoology, spoke. His subject was
“Caves and Cave Life.” Mr. Brown
described in this lecture, the various
environmental conditions existing in
different types of caves, and the ef-
fect of these conditions on the acci-
dental visitors, the transients, and
the residents of caves. Interesting
analogies were drawn between cave
life and total darkness, and deep sea
life ‘and total darkness there.

After the discussion, Dr. E. F.
Adolph spoke of the opportunities dur-
ingthe summer of research and in-
vestigation at the Marine Biological
Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachu-
setts. Mr. J. L. Cartledge ‘told of
similar opportunities at the Brooklyn
Institute of Arts and Sciences Labo-
ratory at Cold -Spring Harbor, L. 1.,

planned for the summer here in Pitts-
burgh. These ten minute talks were
illustrated with lantern slides.

girl is Gwendoline_Narbeth of Swarth-
more, who also is English, having
been over here just nine years. She
and I attended the Biblical Seminary
in New York last year where we took
some training. which was necessary if
we are to teach the Bible. _
_7Miss Anderson, Gwen and I are to
live _in a little house next door to “Les
Aiglons” and we have been having the

best time all summer gathering to- '

getlier allthose manylthings that are
necessary to make a house a home.
Villa Elizabeth will be -our very own
home, and we want it to be‘ just‘ as
homey and-‘attractive as can be so

But you will be; that the French girls will like to,come

there for good times. Since the last
‘of September I have been in Hartford

here in the «Kennedy School of Mis-

sions taking some work is ‘Islam and
Arabic and a few other things too.

I shall haveto speak Frenchiluently
beforell can do very much over there.

Therefore I am‘ to spend several.

months in the ‘University of Algiers
studying French and using it ‘entirely.
"Then I shall" have --to learn Kabyle
which is the language of the native
people for without that I‘can.never

be able _to converse with my poor Mos- «

lem ‘wo_’men who do not know French
andwho cannot read or write at all.
I have barely made a beginning’ in
Arabic whichiis very diﬂicult indeed.

To have any standing with the M‘os- '

lem people -I must be able to read the
Koran in‘—the original tongue.‘ ..

I must not write much more now’
but I hope, you will not _forget ‘me

away over there!’ As I‘ teach "the lit-
tle girls in Les Aiglons, go” in and out
among the poor -distressed Moslem
women and children, or haveteas and
parties for our French girls who are

"in need of wholesome recreation_ and

social life,. I shall ‘no doubt often

think of many"of ‘you with whom I

used to sup tea and have such'goo‘d
times. ‘I "can think of no better way
to express my gratitude for all of
those and other good times that have
come to me than to take‘. some of them

. V  PHARMACY ‘. _ V V
V Dr. Bryan of Parke‘ Davis & Co.,
-Detroit, has. just completed ‘a series
of lectures at the School of Pharmacy.
Since pharmacists should be familiar
with the preparation, uses and thera-
peuticeffects of _:vaccines, serums and
biologically assayed drugs, the School
of Pharmacy arranged to have Dr.
Bryan, a,.specialist_ in this ﬁeld, ac-
quaint the--students with the _V,neces-
sary information. concerning‘ these
products. ’ 1 ‘-

' Dr..Bryan set forth clearly and ‘pre-
cisely the great care that must be
exercised’ by the manufacturer in the

preparation‘; handling and ‘proper

preservation of serums and. vaccines.
His lectures were splendidlyV.‘supple-
mented by appropriate lantern slides
that assisted,‘ in giving his Shearers
ideas concerning ?the methods ’ in-
volved. 3'5‘ ~ ‘ “ 1 I ‘
The" use of these preparations" has
becom-e"extensiVve in recent years and
is necessary forthe prospective phar-
macist-’ to be thoroughlytconversant
withI.them._ Consequently instruction
such‘ as this coupled -with experiment-
-al work in biologic "assay in the Phar-
m'ac'ognostical' laboratory equips the
‘student to ﬁl1'the-demands madequp-'

on him by'the medical profession in

_ '_-1'7’-I‘he Importance of Research ‘in-
‘ *:_Modern Industry” -was the subject of
' c ‘an address delivered on March 21, to
 the faculty and studentsof the chem-
_ istry department of the University by
I \: ES. M.'_ Kintner, head of the Research
 _‘ Department of the Westinghouse Elec-
jtric and Manufacturing Company. Mr.
-.“'Kintner 'was formerly in charge of
fresiearch work being conducted in the
x‘oheInistry- department of the Univer-
. sity. ’ ‘ ’ —
 Kintner covered many phases
.. ‘of the work of his department, deal-
aing-with the" importance of research
‘ in7.industry.in general, as wellas that
;’._v',fconducted- by the local company.
 Commenting on research. and its gen-
;._eral importance he said": “Our pio-
 neer days are over; the days when we

, cjcould enter a new ﬁeld, set up a‘ ma- ‘

chineand reap success are no mere.
The question then was, ‘Will the ma-
fchine work?’ .Now the question is,
 .‘How well and with what. efﬁciency
. . :Wi.11:it W0rk‘?’°’ ’ _ A
 Passing‘ onto the work and‘ prob-‘
 lems‘ of the‘Westingh'o‘use Company,
A7 "he spoke of the one big problem "it
,4 ‘must face——_competiti‘on. He said,
”:“The‘ days of ease, and luxury in in-
" I-dilstry are over; what we now face is
‘ cut-throat competition. To meet this
successfully the production price
must- be reduced to‘ a minimum. and
‘ this is accomplished in two -ways,‘by
. ’i‘lnp‘roving the properties of the mate-
rials and by balancing the factors of
5 control. * . 2 _
‘_‘  “A'side»f_rom’competi‘tion the West;

In ‘conclusion, 'Mr.._Kintner spoke

cus throw, and the shot put as well
as all of the dashes. ‘He was in the
naval aviation during the war, being
discharged in time to get back" to
school for the'1919 season. The
inarked ability which he possesses
was shown by thefact that in the
relay race at the Olympic‘ games he
was picked to run as the anchorman

Shea served as assistant coach for

Coach Barrett faces the diﬂicult task
of getting a team into shape in.a
short time. n , .  H

Coach Barrett knows practically
nothing of. the calibre of the men,
save those" who have made ,a_ name
for themselves in the -high or prep
schools. Al. ischmidt, formerly of Al-
legheny High, has a. fine reputation as
a pitcher and should be a big help for
the Freshies. Harding and Chase, of
Wyoming" Seminary, who were both
on the yearling-footballteam last fall,
are being looked upon as likely mem-
bers of the squad. .VVith the exception
of these few men, the Freshman team

wants every man who can play a fair
game of ball to report to him at once.

teams wishing to compete must report«:'’-‘‘
at the appointed time. Weather :pe _

Tllnning 100 yards. This, event has .
never been staged before but was in? ‘ '
augurated this year to aid. ..Coach_ 
Frank Shea in hissearchfor new‘ ”
sprint material for the track. teams.'_ ‘
Going into the ﬁnal event the Kappa - A -
Sigma team‘ commands a. lead that is
impossible to be overcome, the. near-’ .
est team, the Lambda Chi Alphas,_'be- ,
ing 11 points behind, with a. total of’ -
26.‘ One point behind this team the ‘
Phi Gamma Delts and the Sigma‘ Chis
are tie with 27 points, while the Sig- 
ma Alpha Epsilon are in fourth place
with 28 points. The race that remains
is not for the ﬁrst place cup, but the
cups that are to go to .the winners
of second and third place. The out-
come of this race for ﬁnal honors, de-. , .
pends solelyon the last event, the
100 yard dash, and all of .the above’ ,
grouped teams have large squads,» at‘
work on the indoor track. . 1
2 The Phi "Gamma Delta team, that.
lookedslike  sure winner of the sec-
ond, honors a week ago,_was drol?D.ed
back into a tie for third placeiby as
recent decision of the Interfraternity _~
Conference,.who. ruled that the Phi A
Gamma’s were to be given last place
in the -Distance «Me-dley in place ;of'
their recent ﬁrst; The decisi.on added
8 points to the Phi Gams’ "total and
took 1 point from the total of each 
of the other teams that had conipeted-N Q
in the event. H " H
The trouble started when the Phi] .3
Gams won the Distance Medley with 
the aid of Bill Smyers running the
mile? Smyers, being a Freshman nu-H",
meral man, was not eligible to. com‘-‘ 
pete in the interfrat contest.« With;
their winthrown out they wereigiven‘ I .
another chance to run against time.
without the aid of -Sniyers. ‘ During 
the re-run Hawkins, while runnin the 

   

 
 

2 mile, caught his spike on the narrowjg

  

board that borders the indoor track’
and received a "bad fall being forced 
from the race. The question then» 7.
came up as to whether they could?‘
have another chance to run. ‘At a re-._'-‘i~.
cent meeting of the Interfraternity‘
Conference a decision was handed”.
down ‘based upon the rules of the If.
C. A. A. A. A. which state that ifa
team is forced,‘ from a race because
of a fall or because of injuriesto any"~.‘
of their team that that team will lose‘?
‘the..race, and shall not be given ;a:_-
chance to runvthe event over- _ Thus
the Phi Gains, the former winners;
were given, ninth place (last) with-
out a_ chance.to re-run the event.  
This ruling shifted the Lambdaaphi ‘
Alpha team into second place, butthe -
Phi Gamma Delta team stilli has a.?.
ﬁght-ingchance to ﬁnish in" their for-vi‘
mer position. M . Q
