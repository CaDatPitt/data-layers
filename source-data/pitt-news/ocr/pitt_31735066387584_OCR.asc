MOSCOW — Boris N. Yeltsin,
a protege of Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev who had criticized
the slow pace of reform, was re-
moved Wednesday as Moscow
party boss, state-run television
said.

Yeltsin, 56, was replaced by
Politburo member Lev N. Zaikov.

Yeltsin had tendered his resig-
nation at an Oct. 21 meeting of
the Communist _Party Central
Committee, at which he criti-
cized the style of Soviet leader-
ship and the slow pace of
Gorbachev’s reform campaign.

Soviet television said a meeting
today of the Moscow party com-
mittee found Yeltsin had dis-
played ”major shortcomings” in
his work as party leader in the
capital and relieved him of his
duties.

Gorbachev, the Soviet Com-
munist Party general secretary,
was among those who attended
the meeting, the television said in
its nightly news program Vremya.
The report said Gorbachev
spoke, but it gave no details.

It said the Moscow meeting ap-

I

proved a decision by the October
central committee meeting that
branded Yeltsin’s speech ”politi-
cally erroneous.”

Zaikov, 63, is a member of the
13-man ruling Politburo, who
once headed the Communist
Party apparatus in Leningrad.

Yeltsin also holds an alternate,
or non-voting, seat on the Polit-
buro. After losing his post as
Moscow party boss, his removal
from the ruling body appears vir-
tually assured.

Gorbachev may have
an extended summit

WASHINGTON — American
and Soviet officials met Wednes-
day at the White House to plan
next month's superpower summit
meeting here, amid reports that
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gor-
bachev would extend his stay.

The visit is scheduled to begin
Dec. 7. Initially, the expectation
was that Gorbachev would hold
talks with President Reagan over
two or three days.

But now, the Soviet leader may

Entrepreneur will

offerbusiness tips
at local conference

By Merritt Neale, Jr.
Staff Writer ’

The fourth annual En-
trepreneur’s Day Conference will
be held Tuesday Nov. 17, at the
David Lawrence Convention
Center in downtown Pittsburgh.

The conference is sponsored
by the Enterprise Corporation of
Pittsburgh along with several
other local businesses. According

. to Christine File, rpanager of pro-

grams and communications of
the Enterprise, ”this year's pro-
gram will include 16 sessions on
such helpful topics as business
planning, raising money and mar-
keting.”

" The Enterprise, which was

founded four years ago, has held .
' a conference every year since its
- beginning. The conference has

grown from about 200 par-

- ticipants the first year to a turn-

away crowd of almost 700 last
yeah

The purpose of the convention
is to provide advice on how to
start a business or expand on an
existing one.

The conference will be offering
various workshops throughout
the day which will include
knowledgeable representatives
from local Pittsburgh businesses
who will answer questions on a
one—to—one basis.

Keynote speaker at the confer-
ence luncheon will be one of
Pittsburgh's most notable en-
trepreneurs, Frank J. Schneider,
founder, chairman and chief ex-
ecutive officer of the Schneider
Group of companies.

Schneider started a mechanical
contracting and design engineer-
ing company in 1962. Today his
company employs over 7,000
people, half of which are in the
Pittsburgh area, and its sales have
exceeded $500 million.

”All entrepreneurs and aspiring
entrepreneurs will benefit from
hearing his-insights," said Jack
Thorne, founder of The En-
terprise.

Attendance is limited and pre-
registration is required. Forinfor-
mation, contact the Enterprise
Corporation at 4516 Henry St. in
Oakland.

of civilization over an hour away?

”The fraternities, definitely,”
Price said. ”It’s easy to get in, and
you don't have to pay. It's strict
for guys but not for girls. There's
free beer, dancing, guys; it's a

- good place to meet people.”

Jennifer Case, a sophomore,
agreed with her, saying, ”We like
to drink, so we go to the frats and
hang out.”

Unlike Pitt, though, bars are
something.__,that most students
don't see-‘unti'l they are 21 and
have two IDs to prove it.

—”|t’s almost impossible to get in
without fake IDs,” Price said.
”Most places require two forms
of ID, and the lines always go out
the door. I've never been in, and
I've never tried. There's really no
need to go; we can go to the
fraternities. They usually have
parties on Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday and Saturday, so there's al-
ways someplace to go.”

Maureen Ostrowski,.a junior at
Penn State, added, ”The bars are
so strict, you have to go to frats
or apartments. You can't do any-
thing in your dorm room either.
If they catch you drinking, they
write you up and can kick you off
campus.”

Penn Staters also have dis-
covered traying, the practice of
sled riding on a cafeteria tray.

”We go traying,” said Colleen
Regan, a sophomore. ”When it
snows, we steal trays from the
cafeteriavand go sledding on the
golf course.”

Regan also said students do a
lot of visiting off campus, as
members of the opposite sex
must be escorted at all times
when in a dorm. _

_ ”We just basically go visit peo-
ple,” Regan said. ’’College
Avenue is the main street. There
are a lot of apartment complexes
there. You always see someone
you know.”

Perhaps the only really strange
thing Penn State students do is eat

~ stickies. Stickies are grilled cinna-

mon rolls in butter, something all
true Penn Staters do.

”We go to the diner — Ye Olde
College Diner — and eat grilled
stickies,” Price said. ”It’s a
definite Penn State tradition;
you're not a true Penn Stater un-
less you eat stickies.”

Case added, ”It’s not like a city

out here, i_t’s rural  there is life’

here.”

OK, so we know we hate
THEM. Freshman attending their
first home football game at Pitt
probably wondered why they
heard ”P—E-N—N S-T SUCKS!”
when we weren't even playing
Penn State. After a few games,
however, they realized why we
yell that at every game — we hate
Penn State.

With the Pitt/Penn State
weekend drawing near, feelings
have become even more appar-
ent. The T-shirts with a young boy
in a Pitt helmet going to the
bathroom on Penn State are seen
everywhere. ”Culture vs. Agricul-
ture” pins have come out of

storage. ’’I Hate State” is seen on ~

anything from baseball caps to T-
shirts. The Pitt/Penn State blood
drive is underway. 4 4

if anyone made it to the
Pitt/Penn State game at Penn State‘
last year, they remember the
fights that brol'<e.oE_it.or1-=t_l.°ie_=-field
and aifevv students walking away

with the goal post. Our hatred for
Penn State leadsto the most ob-
vious question: Do they hate us
as much as we hate them?

Jason Skurbe, a junior at Penn
State and the supervisor of Stu-
dent Activities, said of the up-
coming game, ”|t’s the game
Penn State people look most for-
ward to.” '

‘ 

[the hatred between
Pitt and Penn State].is
not as intense this year
because we aren't do-
ing as well as we were
last year;

— Kristen Philepkoski

Skurbe said pins reading ’’I
break for Nittany Lions and back
over Pitt Panthers” arecirculating

throughout State College. Penn."

State doesn’t__have designated ac-
tivities like the blood drive.

Skurbe said the students were
more violent before the Penn
State/Syracuse game this year.
”There will still be a lot of excite-
ment brewing here this week,”
he said.

Debbie Muno, also a junior at
Penn State, said the hatred is vio-
lent, although maybe not as vio-

lent as Pitt's for Penn State. While '

we yell about Penn State at every
game, Penn State students yell
”Shit on Pitt" only.if Pitt scores

are announced during a Penn‘

State game.

Debbie described T-shirts in
distribution throughout the Penn
State canipus. One T—shirt has the
word Pitt printed in the armpit
area of the shirt. Another one
reads, ”My favorite team is Penn
State and whoever plays Pitt.”
She said there will be hundreds

of Penn State students going to

Pitt Stadium this weekend, and

she feels they will be ”rather vio- A

lent” during the game.

State sophomore, said the hatred wt

now resides within the enemy's
walls. There are, however, fresh-
men who beg to differ.

’’I’m not really into [the feud]
because I don't know anything

-about Pittsburgh,” said John

Born, an engineering major at
Penn State. ”They tell me stuff

[propaganda, I'm sure], _ but it
hasn't really affected me [yet].”

Pitt also has its freshmen fanat-
ics. ”Death,” said David Rosen-
garden, when asked what he
thought of Penn State. ”Everyone
hates Penn State.”

’’It’s kind of a fun rivalry,” said
Pitt freshman Mary Bielich. ”lt’s

 

like a kind of conditioning. We
have learned to hate Penn State.”

Besides the obvious difference
of opinion on certain subjects,
are their freshmen any different
than ours? Do they party as
much? Do they take the same
classes? Do they pledge fraterni-
ties and sororities?

”Most of my professors are bor-
ing,” said Domyslawski. ”But
most of my classes are tough.”
Domyslawski said she studies
about three hours a day.

”On weekends,” said Born, ’’I
sleep late, go to the football game
and party till late at night.” Born
said he studies five hours a day.

special emphasis will be on male-
female relationships.

To raise money for various
Charities, Penn State has staged a
spectrum of events, ranging from
a penny-a-ticket carnival on cam-
pus to a kidnapping, in which
university administrators, faculty,
fraternity and sorority presidents
were kidnapped and held for ran-

som in exchange for canned,

goods.

"We collected about 4‘/2 tons
of Canned goods last year,” said
Funk. ”And overall, we raised
about $400,000, which we do-
nated to charities."

One method of cash-raising in-
cluded a 48-hour dance mara-
thon that featured 278 Couples
and produced approximately
$297,000. Funk said the mara-
thon was the largest student-run
Charity event in the country. The
proceeds were forwarded to the
Hershey Medical Center to
benefit children suffering from
cancen

According to Chris Zwycewicz,
executive vice president for IFC,

one of the oldest fraternity and .

sorotity events on Campus is the

Phi Kappa Psi 500, in which par-
ticipants run through the down-
town, stopping to drink at each
bar. .

Zwycewicz added, ”Almost
every weekend has an event 
such as the Canning schedule,” in
which members voluntarily stand
on street Corners collecting
money to be donated to charities.

Individual ‘fraternities and
sororities, however, emphasize
their own events and favorite ac-
tivities.

For instance, Alpha Gamma
Rho, an historically life-science
oriented fraternity, sponsored the
Agriculture Carnival Days, on
Nov. 7. The university's Alumni
Association financed the guests’
accomodations and the wine and
cheese reception held for them.

Alpha Gamma Rho’s little sis-
ter program chairman, Mark
Miller, reported that the event
”benefitted students in and out of
the College of Agriculture be-
cause they were able to interact
with the business representatives
and set up interviews with their
companies.”

Miller said that the carnival was

One black fraternity, Alpha Phi

’’Nevertheless, we didn't have

l asked a rather coinciden-
tal total of 33 (the significance
of which will be explained

later) random Pitt News

staffers to list their three
favorite beers. Budweiser lost

. the No. l spot by one vote. V

Of course, we had those
who had to be exotic and
pick Taddy Porter, Elephant
lvlalt Liquor, Sol, Kulmacher
Reichelbrau Dark, and then
we had a staff writer, whose
name l won't mention in ord-
er to save embarrassment,
who chose lvleister Brau.
Bluckl But it goes down well,
l suppose. J

Staff writer John Young,
who chose our ”dud suds” or
worst beer, Schmidt's, as his
third favorite beer, defended
his choice by stating, ’’I

picked it just because my

dad's been drinking it for l5
years." Sure, John. _

Why does otherwise mild-
mannered cartoonist Todd
Condron like Budweiser?

”Because it's a man's beer.” g

different reason than myself,
said, "This girl l once knew

Interestingly enough, Rolling
Rock, our last choice, was Penn
State's first choice.

According to Brad Gibson, a
housing—beat reporter, "Friday
afternoons, it's happy hour at
the Rathskellar (a popular Penn
State bar), and they serve it by
the case.”

The interesting thing about
Rolling Rock beer is the number
"33" that appears on the label.
Just what does it mean?

We had three different on-
swers here (Pick one, I don't
know which is right):

i . Thirty-three people died in
a Rolling Rock factory accident
long, lon ago.

Continued from page I2
The slogan on the bottle.
The people at Penn State

, were equally battled. But the

story becomes more complex, it
that's believable.

The Rathskellar makes its own
brand at beer, and on the side
at The beer, The number 33 ap-
pears, but nobody knows why,
according to Terry Ivlutchler, a
senior administration reporter.

She said her favorite beer,

 

 

”when I'm rich and get paid, is
Heineken. But in keeping with
The Penn State tradition, I have
to say Skellar. We do what They
call case studies — but instead
at tocusing on hypothetical situ-
ations, we go out Friday after-
noons to that great little hole in
The wall and drink beer."

Lew Bosco, a member of The
sports statt who selected Augs-
burger as his Tavorite beer, said,

  
  

"It has a very clean taste. It's a
beer brewed in Wisconsin. It
agrees with my system, too.”
And although Ivliller beer
didn't make The PSU top I0,
sports editor Bob Williams said

' he likes it because "it's relative-

ly cheap compared to some im-

ports. It's kinda smooth, it

doesn't bite you. It's kinda like

an old dependable dog."
Cheers.

THE PITT NEWS

Fighting furiously about afootball farce

Ah, this weekend marks the 53rd
annual rendition of the Pitt-Penn State
football challenge. Before that, the
game was played nearly every year
since 1893. Almost 100 years of foot-
ball, TOO years of rivalry.

Ah, now there's the rub, as they say .

in one of those old movies. Why is it
that there are two large populations
(not the entire populations of the two
schools, to be sure, but quite big no
less) who have decided that the merits
of a school, and by inference, of the
students, is based on the outcome of
60 minutes of a contact sport.

From where we sit, that all sounds
just a little silly. ‘

True, there is a natural pride in a
school institution, whether it is foot-

ball, the physics lab or one of the‘art ’
museums. One rarely hears, though,

boasting about the relative worths of
students because of a particle acceler-
ator. Rarer still are drunken fisticuffs
over the quality of a school's modern
art collection.

What then, has removed football
from this pleasant sphere of reason?
What is it that can make football so

attractive as a basis for prejudice
toward fellow students? The logic, for
some reason, is elusive at best.

Each year, so much hangs on the
game. We're talking about school
pride here, my man. We're talking
about your school. But no one seems
to be talking. They seemto be cater-
wauling, truly an unpleasant noise.

And so this weekend, the yearly
name—calling madness rolls into town
like a cheap circus. The rides really
aren't any fun, and we already know
what the fat lady looks like. All the

jokes have been told." We all know
that ”Pitt is Shit” is a rather clever
adaptation of that slogan. We all know

it should be hard to take a football S
team from Happy Valley‘ seriously. _
The ringmaster sounds like a cheap ’

Las Vegas lounge act.

The number of students who buy
into this peculiar bit of weirdness is

actually quite frightening. |t’s cause for.

thought that some of them might real-
ly mean it. One shudders to imagine

that there are people who feel hostil—_ , C

ity for Penn State year-round.

Reagan's bluff has been called, the world waits

Ronald Reagan may be in trouble

. this time. Daniel Ortega, president of

Nicaragua, has taken Reagan up on
his offer to join the Central American
peace talks if the Sandinistas agree to
open a dialogue with the Contra
leaders. '

Ortega appears to be dedicated to
getting some sort of peace agreement
together in Nicaragua, regardless of
Reagan's efforts to the contrary, In ef-
fect, he is conceding that his govern-
ment will have to establish
communication with the rebels if
there are to be any hopes of peace.

It might be said that he is trying
something rather new in Central
American politics — talking to your
enemies rather than simply killing
them. Ortega was in the United States
this week trying to convince Ameri-

can legislators that it would be-

productive to engage in negotiations.

Now, Reagan is going to have to
come to some sort of decision. Does
he actually want peace? Does he want
itmore than he wants a war to get the
American public behind him?_ The
proverbial ball is in his court. ‘

A rather bold move has been made
on Ortega’s part. By agreeingto an
American presence in the negotia-

tions, he ha-s put the credibility of his

government on the line. He has essen-
tially opened the talks to the Ameri-
can public, from which most of his
support in this country has come.

Now, everyone has agreed that it

would be a good idea to get together '

and talk about their problems. It is a
small victory, to be sure, but hopefully
it will be only a prelude to continued
progress of the Arias peace effort.

If the proposal was an honest effort
for peace on Reagan's part, then he
should be delighted that Ortega is
showing some interest. He should
pursue further dialogue with the San"-
dinistas, and he should do it with a
healthy dose of civility.

If Reagan's suggestion was just a
public relations gambit, a tip of his hat
to the interests of a majority of the

public, all that will become painfully .

obvious as he adds more and more
qualifications to our joining the talks.
Time, at least this time,'will tell.

WILLIAM
-- YOUNG

Next Wednesday, the wonder-
ful state of Pennsylvania will al-
low me my first legal drink. Boy,
am I excited. I can already taste
the vodka martini now, slowly
trickling down the back of my
throat.

The only thing that bothers me
about next week is that I haven't
earned it. You see, I've never
been turned down by a bar,
restaurant or beer distributor.
Never. It's an odd feeling being
the only person I know who's
never been carded trying to get
into a bar.

I've gone to bars and been the
only one to get in. I've seen
friends who are actually 21 get re-
fused entrance. But me, they al-

 

ways let me in. Don't get me
wrong, I'm not bragging, but I just
don't see the state's logic in say-
ing that next Wednesday at 12:01
a.m. my body and mind will be
ready to handle alcohol. »

I've been drinking alcohol in
varying quantities since the sum-
mer before my senior year in high
school, when I sat down on a bar-
stool in a pub in London and or-
dered a half-pint of beer. It wasn’t
peer pressure that caused me to
order that beer; it was interest. I
was interested in what beer actu-
ally tasted like and why I wasn't
allowed to drink it back here.

Oddly, I liked that first half pint
and ordered another; all the hor-
ror stories I'd heard from high
school buddies about how bad
beer tasted until you got used to
it went out the window as I actu-

ally enjoyed the smooth taste of"

the liquid. Another pint later, and
I was having trouble making it to
the elevator on the way back to
my room.

Most of the evenings I spent in
Europe for the next two weeks
are meshed into a sort of blur,
with Paris seeming more like a
dream than a city filled with rude
people who refused to serve me
the food I plainly told them I
wanted.

I don't think, however, that the
drinking age is totally wrong, just

a bit too high. I won't care about
this on Wednesday morning, but
it seems to me that half the rea-
son people try alcohol is because
they're curious of the unknown,
and the reason they stick to it is
because it‘can provide the user
with a legal ”high” when used in
proper amounts.

I don't think high school stu-
dents should be allowed _to drink.
I say this because I'can’t think of
one offsetting factor that would
make your average high school
student responsible. Sure, there
are responsible teenagers, but I
can't think of many 14-, 15-, 16-,
17- or 18-year-olds who would
actually use alcohol in modera-
tion at a party. It's too new an ex-
perience for them to want to not
experience the full effects.

One-might argue that if you're
brought up thinking that drinking
is no big deal because it's always
available you won't drink as
heavily (as often). Bunk. A
teenager is a teenager regardless
of when he is or isn't allowed to
drink, and the pressures are too
much for the average teen to han-
dle because they all want to fit in
at a party. >

Now I've been drinking for
several years, albeit illegally, but
it's all been too easy. I was almost
caught in a bar raid at home this

Your honor, Ma Bell did it

I was watching CNN Headline
News the other evening, and a
story came on about two Califor-
nia families who are suing Pacif-
ic Bell because of incidents that
occurred after the one family's
son listened to a 976 sex line. It
seems that after the 10-year-old
boy listened to the message, he
went next door to the neighbor's
and engaged in sexual inter-
course with their four-year-old
daughter.

The little girl's parents aren't su-
ing the young boy's parents, but
have teamed up with them in
order to sue the phone company
for $10 million. The reason? It
costs money to have those 976

‘numbers blocked from one's

phone line. They are arguing that
this service should be free, and
that since their phone was not
blocked, the boy had access to
the 976 numbers.

Seems that there is a solution
to the 976 number problem. The

JEFF
MAFFE

phone companies should block
all of the sex lines from every-
body's phone. If you want to call
these numbers, you should have,
a code card, similar to those is-
sued by the phone companies in
order to make long distance
phone calls. This way, only those
who want to use these lines will
have access to them.

Some of these 976 lines do, in
some people's cases, serve a pur-
pose. Some people are astrologi-
cal buffs, some are sports fans
and some like to keep up with
their soap opera when they miss
it. I do not see any reason why
these should be blocked, except
for the fact that they are so damn
expensive. In fact, doesn't the
Donne/Iy Directory have most of
these phone services for free?

If 976 information numbers
want to compete with such com-
panies like Do_nnelly which are
providing free information, they
should better their services, offer
the customer a hell of a lot more
than they get now and lower their
prices.

How about those talk lines that
you hear about every time you
turn on aradio or television? Call
one of those party lines, like LIVE-
WIRE, and you just get garbled
conversation because everybody
is trying to talk at one time.

Sure, some ofthese talk lines
can serve a purpose. Say some-
one is a true introvert and afraid
of all people. If he or she wants
to talk to somebody, and they
don't know anybody, these num-
bers can serve as a release.
However, for about the same
price as talking to some of the B0-
zos that use the party _lines for 10
or 20 minutes, you could see a
good shrink and get professional
help.

The only 976 number that I
found that seems actually legiti-
mate is the Voice Exchange. It is
more like a dating service than
anything. You can listen to mes-
sages from other men or women,
leave your own or leave a mes-
sage in somebody else’s box. For
those who hate the sing|e’s bar
scenes, or don't have time to go
look for dates, this line provides
a cheaper service than paying
Matchmaker $35.

The whole 976 system needs to

be redone. These are just some of »

my thoughts, but nothing will
ever get done. It's big business in
the way, you know.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, November 12, 1987

Go to the bar and havesome beers

summer, but once again, I
managed to exempt myself from
being 21. After sweating it out
waiting for one of the officers to
come and check my ID, I decid-
ed that I wasn't waiting any
longer, so I headed for the door,
and the two cops guarding it.

They were checking IDs as
people left the bar, and I figured
I was cooked. I walked right up
to one of the officers, looked him
in the eye (quite nervously, I
thought at the time) and asked
him if he-wanted to see my iden-
tification. He smiled and said no.
No. I wasn't 21.

So what's the big deal with be-
ing 21? Why am I more capable
of drinking legally now than I was

' when I was 18? Why is it that I

can die for my country, but I can't
drink in my state? It's been said
before, but nobody ever listens.
If all those 18-to-20—year—o|ds
want the right to drink, they
should all register to vote and

press a political candidate to.

bring up the issue.

So what's the big .deal with
turning 21? Beats me, but at least
I can drink cocktails with my rela-

tives over the holidays instead of

Diet Squirt.

ELLEN
GOODMAN

The morning it came to him,
my friend was taking his daily
bike ride to nowhere. Up on the
exercycle, earphones in place, he
was twirling the dial, trying to
find some decent traveling music
on the airwaves.

At precisely 7:45 a.m., just
when the digital readout reached
his aerobic level, he had located
it: a great station. The hits kept
coming, and my friend kept bicy—
cling. Then, suddenly, a woman
with a youthful voice interrupted
his biking high to make an an-
nouncement. "Good morning.
You're listening to Oldies I03."

Oldies? Had his discovery
been an oldies station? The very
notion was enough to give him a

coronary if, of course, he wasn't
in such great shape for his age.
Oldies were Frank Sinatra, not
the Rolling Stones. Oldies were
his parents, not him.

My friend (I will call him Bruce
Babyboomer) was a member of
the birthing class of 1946 and
husband of Betty, circa 1948. He
was notunaware of middle age.
Indeed, Bruce had received the
bikefor his 40th. But he had

_ never felt quite so pushed into the

next generation until
Oldies.

His mind began to race
through other evidence that he

HOW.

_ had come of age. There was a

man of exactly his years who was
being considered for the Supreme
Court. There was a man younger
than he running for president of
the United States.

Just recently, his wife had
pointed out how young the wom-
en in the Oil of Olay_ ads were
thesedays. Why would some-
body of only 30 worry about
wrinkles? "

Then, on television last night,
he had seen another of those ads
for Dow Chemical, the ones in
which young people tell how
grand it is to work for a socially
responsible employer — the very
same employer that had been fa-
mous in Bruce's 205 for making
napalm.

If that were not bad enough,
the Vietnam War, his war, had
been resurrected and reduced to
a weekly program. To college stu-
dents, he imagined, like a World

War II show. Oldies.

Cycling away, he started to
think about another sign of aging.
Had his generation begun to be-
have like any other generation,
bashing the young?

The jokes making the rounds
among his friends since the stock

, crash had all carried that edge.

They were jokes about 22-year-
old arbitrageurs who had it com-
ing. Jokes about know-it-all 25
year—old brokers. About the
younger generation. About kids
today. i

A. friend of Bruce and Betty's
had spent the weekend with
teenage nephews and come back
aghast. These teenagers didn't
know who Gene McCarthy was,
what happened at Woodstock,
where the Ho Chi Minh trail was.

"They aren't getting the same
education wehad," complained
the uncle, who was born in 1951.
Culturally illiterate, the trio of
Babyboomers all agreed. But
now my friend wondered
whether the boys were cultural-
ly illiterate or just young.

Bruce began to mentally list
some of the changes that were
occuring as his postwar cohorts
came into midlife. In the schools
where they teach, the movement
is toward "structure" for the
young and back to the "basics”
for their education. In the courts
where they practice, the pendu-
lum had swung from expanding
student rights to supporting
authority. _

The colleges they liberated are

ages with their blessings. Every- 

where among his peers, there is

aging and with.it a bit of youth-
bashing, a touch of youth-.,.

squashing.

Is this just a midcourse correc- 
tion for a society that had adulat-
ed youth, he wondered? Or his ; fit

generation that took power in its V
youth, consolidating it in midlife. 
Are the new "Oldies” tightening '

It is odd enough for any mem_-_''
ber of a massive youth generation —'
to ride over the line, even on a '

of Oldies. But who would have

"They always say that time

have to change them yourself."
— Andy Warhol, American pop
artist (1928-1987).

I literally stumbled across this
today on my way to something
else. For some reason, AP decid-
ed to send it over the news wire,

and I guess somebody should"

read it. I liked it, but then I like
most everything Warhol had to
say.

He wasn't afraid to speak his
mind, even when it had nothing
to do with the conversation of
which he was a part. It led to a
good many obtuse statements,
but he claimed it was all part of
his art, which was justification in
his eyes.

I don't have anything else to
say about Mr. Warhol, but I did
like the movie Sleep. Eight hours

mail it to Warhol, even though
he's dead. Somewhere, he just
might get a laugh out of the
whole thing. V

I think getting, or having, a
laugh is one of the most impor-
tant things going. If everyone
laughed just one time each day,
if for, say, five minutes each af-
ternoon, it would be a lot easier
to make it through the day. Not
to mention you could laugh at
whomever you pleased, or about
whatever tickled your fancy, and
no one would be the wiser.
They'd be too busy making sure
no one understood what they
were laughing about. Maybe the
thing would produce more anxi-
ety than it would alleviate. It was
just a passing idea anyhow.

Whoops. Someone just in-

THE PITT NEWS

By Christopher Sepesy
Staff Writer

Don't expect anything big.

There may be up to 20 people
on stage tonight at the Civic Are-
na, but instead of glaring noises

.  of neo-olde impersonation or ye

olde-neo rehashable funk, only
one sound will be emanating
from that arena. Simple. Stoic.
Teeming with that which sep-
arates the pure from the counter-

 feit, the honesty from the gloss.

Rooty toot toot, everybody; he
of the cornfield conscience and
the social shitkickers is here.

John Cougar Mellencamp. For
me, at least, that name evokes
some very good memories of
some very good times. No, at age
16 I wasn't sucking on some
chilidogs behind some Tasty
Freeze. The lyrics he sings are

,about some of the modes he ex-
perienced growing up in a small
town, which in turn relate to
one’s own mode—memory, most
of the time gilt-edged in
retrospect. That's the magic of
Mellencamp's songs, and that's

I ‘_ the magic of Mellencamp as a

singer. '
Perhaps the best thing I've

 heard said about Mellencamp

comes from a Village Voice
review by critic Chuck Eddy. He
writes, "No one currently making
music, platinum or otherwise, has
done more than Mellencamp to
earn the audience's respect.”

I‘ This classy singer performs two shows-this weekend at the Syria Mosque.

Lonely boy finds city

There it is in a nutshell.

Mel|encamp's true stardom
came in 1982 with the overnight
smashing success of American
Fool, containing such hits as
"Hurts So Good," and the song
I will still argue as the definitive
song of the 1980s to date, "Jack
and Diane." What most people
don't know is that he had five
previous albums. I first found out
about him when I received a
copy of Chestnut Street Incident
(his first album which, if lucky,
sold 1,000 copies) as a gift for my
birthday. I had no idea who or
what John Cougar was, but even
at the age of 12, I knew I liked it.
And since then, nothing has real-
ly changed as far as my end, a
fan's end, of the story goes. At
present, I have every one of his
albums and think they're all
great. _

But John Cougar Mellencamp
has changed. A lot.

If what the Byrds sang is true,
about everything having a season
and all, then Mellencamp right
now is somewhere within the
mid-to—late summer of his career.

His beginnings are now behind
him, and the fears of |ate—spring
adolescence such as what was
heard on American Fool — /Hold
on to sixteen as long as you
can/change comin' roundreal
soon make us women and men
— have also passed.

Anita Baker:
Enrapturing a
national audience

By Lorey Kelley

Staff Writer

Webster's definition of "rap—
ture": extreme joy, ecstasy, bliss,
love. Rapture envelopes Anita
Baker's exuberant disposition as
well as her talent. The huge suc-
cess of her latest album entitled
(what else?) Rapture is a long-
awaited triumph for Baker.

While many view Anita Baker
as an exciting new talent in the
music industry, few know that
she has been in the business for
many years. A native of Detroit,
Baker made her stage debut at the
age of 16. She sang with various
local Detroit bands. She record-
ed her first album for Ariola
Records with a group called
Chapter 8 in 1980. The group
broke up when Ariola merged
with Arista. ,

Baker's next album The Song-
stress was a solo album. It was
released in 1980 under an in-
dependent label, Beverly Glen
Records. This album gave Baker
recognition among the black au-
dience/._ A single from the album
entitled "Ange|" was a big hit in
Pittsburgh.

Rapture, Baker's first LP with
Elektra Records, was released in
1986. The album clearly exem-
plifies Baker’s fusion of gospel,

/blues and jazz into a unique style

that has led to Baker's name be-
ing.mentioned in the company of
great singers like Ella Fitzgerald,
Billie Holiday and Nancy Wilson.
"Sweet Love" was the first single
released from the album, and it
was a monster hit. It was fol-
lowed by "Rapture," "Same Old
Love," and most recently, "No
One In The World'f

The album has hit No. 1 on the
R&B charts and No. 11 on the
pop charts. Baker received two
Grammys for R&B Female
Vocalist of the Year (Rapture) and
Single of the Year ("Sweet
Love”)

Rolling Stone's Readers and
Critics Poll awarded her Best

New Female Singer and Best Fe— _

male Singer. Her London appear-
ance at Hammersmith Odeon
netted her an award for Concert
of the Year.

Baker has received numerous
other accolades and will no
doubt receive many more. Anita
Baker is definitely a hot com-
modity. Her concerts have sold
out in major cities across the
country. . . -.

She will be performing atthe
Syria Mosque on Nov. 14 and 15.
If past performances are any in-
dication of what is to come, this
concert promises to be the class-
iest and maybe the best concert
Pittsburgh will see this year.

John: Seen the new Belinda
Carlisle clip, Nancy? You
know, I think heaven really is
a place on Earth when Belin-
da sports her natural hair color
and a strapless dress in the
same video.

Nancy: Excuse me, John,
but red is not Belinda
Carlis|e's natural hair color. It's
just a color she hasn't tried yet.
And what does her dress have
to do with the video, John?

John: Well, two very impor-
tant things 

Nancy: Get to the point.

John: Oooh, would I like to
get to the point 

Nancy: John, what about
this video? What about the fact
it was directed by Diane Kea-
ton? What about those masked
dancers holding beach balls
that look like globes? Why are
they there?

John: I really don't know
myself, Nancy. I have a ques-
tion, though, too: Why does
this song sound like Bon Jovi
with a chick singer? -

Nancy: A chick singer? I ad-
mit Belinda Carlisle is buying
into the sexist model for

videos today, and I admit the
video isn't good, and neither
is the song. That doesn't mean
you can reduce her to the lev-
el of Bon Jovi.

John: Oh. How about the
new Debbie Gibson video?
Nancy: Never mind, John.

John: Oh. Seen George
Michael's new video, Nancy?

Nancy: ‘What, you mean
"Faith?"' Can you believe he '
managed to shoot a video that
has only two shots of a wom-
an's naked legs in it?

John: Yeah, that is a real
shame. By the way, do you
find this pale-boy twerp sexy,
what with you being a female
and all, Nancy?

Nancy: John, you are rude.
If you think you can explain
womenin the same desperate-
for—sex terms you explain men,
you've got another think com-
ing. Maybe if you spent less
time looking at the woman's
legs and more time observing
the quality of the video, you'd
be a better reviewer.

John:_OK, Nancy, the video
sucks.

Nancy: Seen the new Sting
video, John?

John: You mean that pop
fairy tale about "you, me and

_thought it had something to do

baby makes three?" What
lame, pseudo-funk drivel. I ex-
pect more from pretentious
artsies like Mr. Sumner.

Nancy: Honestly, John, you
really are a rock snob. You
can't get past the funky bass
line and see that this song is
something really different for
Sting. _

John: Yeah, a Top 20 hit.

Nancy: I like this song, ’
though, I don't particularly like
this video. Despite the fine
choreography, I fail to under-
stand the heavy schizophren-
ic symbolism. Maybe you can
explain it to me.

John: Anything for a lady: It
means the video director
thinks he's as much of a snot-
ty artiste as Sting.

Nancy: Oh, thanks. I
with Sting’s inability to handle
love relationships.

John: My, that's deep,
-Nancy. S

Nancy: I'm sorry, did I go
over your head?

John: It's not impossible.
Maybe I'll learn enough by
next week to give you a real
intellectual challenge. _

Nancy: Then again, maybe
not.

lesus & MarY Chain comes to town but not On SundaY

By Michele Kiraly

Assistant Entertainment Editor

What's happening here?
There's other entertainment in
town besides Monday night foot-
ball. The Upstage now has Mon-
day night dance parties. This past

Monday, if you were willing to

stretch city limits to IUP, Love
and Rockets played to a cheering

T crowd. Two Mondays from now,

Squeeze and the Silencers will hit
the Syria Mosque.
But this Monday, Nov. 16

   
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
  

The Chain tears up
Graffiti this Monday.

Graffiti is where it's at, when it
hosts the Jesus and Mary Chain.
Of course, with such an inspiring
name, you wouldn't expect this
band to play on a Sunday.

An old Rolling Stone headline
read something like ”Does Jesus

and Mary Chain have a prayer?” '

From the popularity of their 1985
debut album Psychocandy, it
seemed that the band's trademark
of guitar fuzz and waning vocals
would make some waves. Unfor-
tunately, the Chain’s outrageous

live performances caused them to

eceive too many disapproving

words from music critics.

Vocalistlim Reid said in a Roll-
ing Stone interview that back
then, the band had become a toy
for the media. ’’It got to the point
where we were being portrayed
as drunken idiots. lt’s complete-
ly untrue. Just because the music
is loaded doesn't mean we're
loaded.”

This is a perfect example of
”how not to believe everything
unappreciative critics have to
say.” But a few approving words
did manage to slip through. Psy-
chocandy was called ”unforget-
table,” ”innovative” and ”a wall
of noise that offers endless vistas
of melody and emotion.”

The Scottish band that includes
brothers Jim and Wi|liamSReid,
bassist Douglas Hart and drum-
mer Bobby Gillespie, played
around the country's new music

scene before signing with Reprise’

J

Records. William plays guitar,
and Jim sings in Lou Reed's flat,
nearly monotone voice.

And that's not suprising since
the Velvet Underground is just
one band that the Chain inhale
and exhale with loud, noisy

breaths. The dark, death-music of_

Suicide and the vigor of the Ra-
mones are in the Chain sound,
too. A

» The world didn't hear from the
band last year, but one might
wonder if this year's new Dark-

lands is worth the wait. The.

sound is more polished and

doesn't contain much fuzz; when ‘

you lose a little static, you lose a
little of the thrill. But the Chain
does keep depth and some taut
melody in this latest effort.

Let's hope that the band called
”punk rock resurrected” will lean ,

toward the Psychocandy sound
for the Graffiti show.

Opal is set to support the Mary '
Chain on Monday with their hap-

py nightmare music.

to the early summertime blues of
Scarecrow. ’ ‘

Now, it's time to get down to
some thinking. His newest al-
bum, and that which thetour is
for, is The Lonesome jubilee. And
it is obvious there is more going
on here than walls coming ”tum-
blin’ down.”

’’I don't want to write anymore
songs that make people feel bad
about themselves,_” says Mellen-
camp. ’’I only want to write songs
that raise their self esteem  so
that no matter how many times

they've been knocked down,_

they have the cou rage to get back

Mellencamp claimed that his

are nothing but peaens to ”the

It would be easy for three

Melman has been a regular

Rita Rudner was born in Mia-
mi, Fla. She graduated from high
school at age 15 and moved to
New York to be a dancer. She ap-
peared in several shows on
Broadway and made the switch
to comedy seven years ago.

She worked her. way up the
hard way. ’’I paid many dues. I

paid other people's dues. it was-

very difficult.”

She's been featured on an HBO
Comedy Special, has another
special coming out on Showtime
next month and is in two movies

_ that will be released in 1988.

It's been said that her comedy
is very Woody Allen—ish. ”l

He gave his version of how the
three comics were chosen for this
tour.

”They wanted a mixed ticket.
Larry ”Bud” Melman brings in
the Eastern Bloc, l, of course,
bring in the Midwest [He's from
Chicago], and Rita brings in the
South. I'm a conservative, Rita's
a Liberal, and Larry is kind of a
mixed candidate — that way we
have a balanced ticket that will
appeal to all voters, and we'll
bring a new reign of fascism to
this great country of ours.”

Philips dropped out of the
University of lllinois. ’’I felt bad
about dropping out, because I
was a big Dungeons and Dragons

Rival schools receive the gift of Gob     

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

If a family that plays together
stays together, where does that
leave Penn State linebacker Scott
Gob? _

Gob, a 6—foot, 239—pound
sophomore linebacker from
Bethel Park High‘School, didn't
follow in his father Arthur's
footsteps.

Arthur Gob played for Pitt from
1957-58, and Scott's brother,
Craig, a 6—foot-1 , 219-pounder, is
a freshman linebacker at Pitt.

Both brothers, however, feel
their father had no influence on
their decision to attend rival
schools.

Panther-

Penn St.
rivalry
revisited

 Finally, after a thre?eéyea;r‘.tiIatt._i;_,s.;_;‘~.1§ _'

hibernatus, the Pitt—Penn State

collision, Pennsylvania's‘annual.“'

Civil War renewed, has some

very serious implications aside

from the colloquial, ”Webeat

yins guys,” heckling ’tween in-

trastate pigskin partisans. Gotta

go way back to 1983 to find the‘
last year that both squads came

into the battle brandishing 6—p|us

wins and potential post-season

play on the horizon.

Joe Paterno’s Nittany Lions are
once again sporting their typical
late fall bowl—bou'nd record at
7-2, while Mike Gottfried’s yo—yo—
ing Panthers have battled their
way to a very respectable 6-3
slate. . .

And it's November, right? The
snow’s a—flying, the leaves have
again succumbed to gravity and
Jack Frost has already checked in
a few times at the University Inn;
that wonderful Western Pee—Ay
football weather is upon us, and,
just like old. times, those sacred
bowl folk will be in town this
Saturday to witness the catfight.

Oh, itspretty safe to say that
the winner will land the more at-
tractive Christmas-New Year's

. field trip. Representatives from

the Hall of Fame, Bluebonnet,
Gator, Peach and Fiesta bowls

are scheduled to be in the press

”My dadAdidn’t put any pres-
sure on Scott. He let us make our
own decisions on where we
wantedto play,” said‘Cr-aig. “My
dad is very »down—to-earth. He
looks for both of us to have a
good game and hopes no one
will get hurt.

”Our parents are usually able
to see- both games. If they can't
do it, they take turns. They cheer
for both of us to do well,” he
added. - -

”Our parents are indifferent.
They don't take it into account,”
said Scott, who was redshirted his
freshman year. ”They let me go
where I wanted to go and let my
brother go where he wanted to

/I

go.

 

 

As for each other, one may ex-
pect a little animosity between
brothers to surface during the sea-
son. After all, matching up Pitt
and Penn State wouldtake sibling
rivalry one step further. But for
these ..two, they are very suppor-
tive of one another.

”I speak to him twice a week.
We talk about bowl games, our
final records, how we're doing.
We're pretty close as brothers go.
We're a close family,” said Craig.
”My brother is very laidback
about the situation. He knew
we'd see each other one way or
another.”

’’I talk to him once or twice a
week, just to see how things are
going — usually on Sundaysand

Thursdays,” explained Scott, who
added with a laugh, ’’I try to get
a little information out ‘of him.”

It was only a coupleof years
ago when this situation was
reversed. Scott was at Penn State,
and Craig was still at Bethel Park

. when Scott told Craig some of the

moves at Penn State.

”I told him a couple of things,
some schemes a couple of years
ago. I wasn't sure wh-at was going
to happen, if he was going to
come to school here,” said Scott.

However, Craig concedes that
he doesn't remember any of the
information. ”When I came here
to Pitt, I had to learn our own
defense. Penn State's [defense]
went out of my head. There is

 

_ _Tl1.uri%s.dciy,ttNiovémbe‘f;12,§ég3jl?87  

    

nothing I could remember.” , ..
Craig's decision to come to Pitt -. » I "
doesn't mean he wasn't int_e_rest- '
ed in following his brother's foot-
steps. Scott did not, in any way, _ 
want to influence his brother's A ‘
choice. When it came time for ~
Craig to visit Penn State, some- '
one else gave him the tour.
”When he visited Penn State, I
it was better he was without _his7 ._ :_
brother — better that he was with 
someone else," he said. 2‘
”You have to go where you
can be happy. If it were reversed,
I don't know what I’d.do.-He
‘probably wanted to find’ his own
identity. He wouldn't have to",-

Thomas’ running style willtest Panthers

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

Since the early 1970s, Penn
State has produced a number of
running backs for the NFL.

Lydell Mitchell, Franco Harris,
John Cappelletti, Mike Guman,
Matt Suhey, Curt Warner, DJ.
Dozier, Steve Smith and Tim

well—known players,'wi.th the lat-

draft within the first three rounds.

Losing so much talent at one
position may leave a team a lit-
tle thin, but at Penn State, they
have found someone who can fill
the position and do a pretty good
job at it.

Junior Blair Thomas has the
starting tailback position and has
responded well, rushing for
1,113 yardson only 206 carries
(5.4 yards per carry) and #10

Not only is Thomas leading the
team in “rushing, but he is the
leadingreceiver as well. He has
22 receptions for 292 yardst(13.3

yards per catch) for two
touchdowns.
Rushing, however, is his

specialty, and he gives some of
the credit to his predecessor, D.I.
Dozier, now with the Minnesota
Vikings, for his success.

,”I didn't feel.,that' much pres-

sure coming’ in thisjseasoln be—' 4

cause I played behind him last
year,” said Thomas. ”I learned a
lot from D.I. — pass protection,
setting up blocks. You miss those
guys who you learn from.”
Thomas was a good student to
those who taught him. When he
went to Penn State as a freshman,
he went because of ’’the overall
success, and I felt comfortable
with -the coaches.” That freshman
year gave him a chancetoglet-his

Last year, Thomas rushed 60  ,
times for 504 yards for an aver- ' '

By Eric Reuscher
For The Pitt News ’

Some Pitt players use the annu-
al battle against Penn_State as a
barometer for the success of the
season.

For others, beating the Nittany
Lions is- fulfillment of a lifetime
dream.

' But every player agrees on one
thing —- Saturday -night's game at
Pitt Stadium is the biggest of the
year for both teams. No special

‘ploy is needed to reach the

psyche of any player. They all
have known the importance of
this battlesince their freshman
season.

For this year's Pitt seniors, the
game takes on a meaning no one
else on the team can understand.
This is their last shot at beating
the disliked and sometimes hat-
ed boys from Happy Valley.

And the best thing about this

were, of course, a great embar-
rassment to Gottfried. They es-
sentially -implied that, since
Gottfried couldn't control his
own players, then maybe Pater-
no should. Gottfried added fuel
to the fi re after the game when he
vowed that he and his players
would never forget what Penn
State did to them that day.

So there you have it. Pitt-Penn

a great game: tradition, rivalry,

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, November I2, 1987

State's Fiesta Bowl hero
Ciftopoulos fighting pain
and injury to save season

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

Being from Canada, many foot-
ball players do not get too much
attention from American col-
leges, but for Penn State lineback-
er Pete Giftopoulos, nothing
could be further from the truth.

”A lot of schools recruited me
-— about 20 of them. I had it nar-
rowed down to Syracuse, Michi-
gan and Penn State as the final
three schools,” said Giftopoulos,
a native of Hamilton, Ontario. ”I
thought Penn State would be the
best place to win the national
championship,” Giftopolous
said. ‘

Giftopoulos got his wish as
Penn State won the 1986 nation-
al championship over Miami.
Giftopoulos helped to make_his
dream come true when he inter-
cepted a Vinny Testaverde pass
at the goal line in the closing se-
conds of the Fiesta Bowl to en-
sure the victory.

The national championship
was the icing on the cake for

[X7 Giftopoulos, who had a great sea-

son as a junior. He was second
on the team in tackles, with 71,
42 unassisted. (Shane Conlan,
now with the Buffalo Bills, had
79.) He also recorded three sacks,
two fumble recoveries, two
broken—up passes and two inter-
ceptions.

In May, Giftopoulos was one of
15 top college players selected by
sportswriters as a member of the
Fiesta Bowl’s 1987 ”Samaritan
All-America” team honored in

  Seniors——

Gadson, who's from Frogmore,
S.C, summarized the game this
way, ”This is the biggest game in
college football. It feels great to
be part of such a game. It's going
to be fun this year, and it means
a lot to me because l’m starting.”

Wall, a native Pittsburgher who
graduated from North Allegheny
High School, echoed Gadson’s
sentiments. _

”There is nothing in the world
like this game. This game makes
football fun,” Wall said. ”Being
from Pittsburgh, I've had a lot of
friends go to Penn State, which
makes the game even more spe-
cial. This will be the biggest game
of my life."

”I was recruited by . Penn
State,” Stewart said. ”Since I
chose Pitt, I don't think too high-
ly of them, and they don't think
too highly of me. I'll do what I
‘can to beat them.”

Richard transferred two years ,

ago from a junior college. He had
this to say about the game: ’’I was
really pumped up last year, but
I didn't feel as excited as every-
one else. This year I understand
the game and what it means. I'll
be just as fired up as everyone
else.”

”|’ve been around the rivalry
all my life,’’ said Austin, a native
of nearby Sharon. ”It's been
everything I thought it would be.
l’m going to miss the big rivalry
and all the hype leading up to the

game when Saturday's game.

ends/’ I ',

Phoenix, Ariz. He was also an
honorable mention on The As-
sociated Press All—East team.

But this football year has been
a major disappointment for
Giftopoulos. During one of the fi-
nal spring scrimmages, he broke
abone in his leg and missed "the
annual Blue-White game. He was
expected to return in the fall at
full strength, but several nagging
injuries have hampered his per-
formance.

”I haven't had a good game
due to the injuries. l’m playing
about 75 percent — playing with

_a cast on my hand,” said

Giftopoulos, who was quick to
add, ”but this could be beneficial
to the team to have some of the
young guys playing, like Scott
Gob, who's from Pittsburgh.

”|’l| be splitting time in alternat-

ing series. Scott's a great kid and .

will probably start. I don't want
to start against Pitt because I don't
want to hurt the team's chances.
Anytime a player has a lock on
you, you can't use your hands,”
explained Giftopoulos.

What little action Giftopoulos

has seen this season, he has made
the most of, registering 25 tack-
les, 24 of which are unassisted,

recovering two fumbles and inter-

cepting one pass.

Giftopoulos feels he will, be
well enough to start next week
against.Notre Dame, Penn State's
last game of the season,‘ which
will be played at Beaver Stadium.

"I'll probably start the last
game because it'll be my last

game” said Giftopoulos.

But the fact that it will be Notre
Dame may please Giftopoulos.
Aside from last year's national
championship, his second
greatest moment at Penn State
was the game at South Bend last
yean

”It was one of those games you
put together, a combination. That
Notre Dame game was the big-
gest thrill, especially since it was
at Notre Dame Stadium. I had an
interception and a fumble. I was
happy with that,” he said.
Giftopoulos also had 11 tackles
in that game.

Giftopoulos expects to see
playing time this week, and he is
impressed with the Panther
offense, especially with freshman
quarterback Darnell Dickerson.

”He’s a good quarterback. He
keeps his cool, doesn't get out of
whack and knows when to run.
He's impressed me on the films.

”Heyward is their biggest
threat. He's a tough running
back. We'll have to run against
him," he added. ‘

As for the team and the rivalry
between the two schools,
Giftopoulos knows that personal
pride will play a major part in the
game.

”We have a lot of people who

know what to expect — even Pitt’

and Notre Dame know. We have

to get ready for Pitt,” said~

Giftopoulos. ”There are bragging
rights for a lot of guys on the
team.‘A lot of the guys are from
Pittsburgh.”

For quite some time, it seemed
that Panther free safety Teryl
Austin had seen hislast Pitt-Penn
State matchup, at least from a
”stare into the quarterback’s
eyes," first—and-I0 perspective.
But things somehow worked out
with the NCAA, and now the
fifth-year senior from'Sha’ron, Pa.,
is out on the col_d turf with his
teammates practicing for his last
shot at the despised Nittany
Lions, and he plans on making
the most of it.

”I can't tell you how much I

. want to win this football game,”
Austin said at the Panthers’ week-
ly media luncheon on Tuesday.
’’I know it's only going to count
as=one win in the standings, but
it's such a special game, such a
rivalry.

”Practices have been intense,
just like they've always been be-
fore playing [Penn State]. It's hard

to explain the atmosphere around
here when we're preparing for
Penn State. It's that different.”

Looking back over his years
with the Panther football’pro-

 

T gram, Austin has seen the good,

the bad and even thelugly sides
of one of.the nation's finest'col-
legiate gridiron rivalries. '

’»’l rememberwhen I was a red-
shirt freshman. We didn't have a
very good season [Pitt finished
3-7-1], but we went up to State
College and beat them. It was
one of the greatest feelings I've
ever had on at football field,” he
recalled.

”But_my very first year. here in
1983 — well, that 24-24 tie real-
ly stands 7 out in my mind. I
thought we had the‘ thing won,
and all of a sudden the referees
were saying there was more time
left on the clock. Then they
kicked the field goal to tie it. That
was an empty feeling. » A

”And, of course, they've beat-

en us up pretty badlythe last two

years.”

Beaten up — ‘indeed-a pretty
good description" of how last
year's Pitt-PSU ended. Remember
those fourth—quarter, bench-
clearing fisticuffs between Austin
and Penn State back Brian Chiz_-
mar after a punt return? The one
that resulted in Joe Paterno’s
memorable but penalty-free imi-

tation of the Sooner Schooner I

(see highlights of .the 1985

H Qrange Bowl between Oklaho-

ieii3§3?ll?an'd5”—i‘W-a‘shi7ngton) sprinting

1 across the muddy sod like he did?

I ”You guys are a disgrace to the

game!” cried the aging, bespec-

tacled legend to no one and
everyone -in particular. .
Austin's year-later perspective?

“Right after it happened, I was

pretty -mad about the whole
thing. But now I see there's‘ so
much personal pride involved in

A the game that things like that can

and sometimes do happen,” he
explained. ”Still, that was all last
year. This is this year. We won't};
be looking to get certain people.

' There's no revenge factorin-
volved, just the talking frightslof ~-

Pennsylvania. ‘ 

, ’’Even ifthere wasn't that fight‘
last year, ‘we'd still be a'pp-roach-I
' ing this game the same way, with

the same intensit_y..”

Although always a Panther at
heart, Austin does have some
slight, indirect ties with the State
program. ”Penn State never
bothered to recruit me initially.
They made a pitch forme late in

‘the recruiting year, but by then,

I had already signed with Pitt. I
do know several of their players,
though. For instance, I played
against [Nittany Lion free safety]
Marques Henderson in high
school. And I showed Blair
Thomas around campus when he
was on a recruiting vis_it here.”

And speaking of Blair Thomas,
Austin insists that putting the
clamps on the All-America can-
didate is the key to a Panther vic-
tory Saturday. ”We’ve got to stop
Thomas. We can't let him have

any long gains. Their rushing at- ‘

tack is their main strength. Take
that away, and we have a good
shot at them.”

' Better make the most of it,
Teryl. There won't be any second
chances this time around.

well, catching seven passes for 59

yards.

This season, Thomas is obvi-
ously having his best, but enter-
ing the season, he didn’t set any
outrageous goals for himself, but
there was one thing he needed to
do in order to have a successful
season.

”My goal at the beginning of
the season was to stay healthy,
and I've done that/_’ said Thomas.

, With two games remaining,
Thomas must face two of the
tougher defenses in the country

in Pitt and Notre Dame.

”We have to take it one game
at a time. We have to concentrate
on Pitt. We have to approach it
as another game and attack their
defense.

”They have a great defense and
do a lot of different things. [Pitt
senior linebacker Ezekial] Gad-
son is a good pass rusher. They

have a good defense, and they‘

play very well,” added Thomas.

As for the little outbreak at the
end of last year's game, Thomas
chalks it up to the rivalry that con-
tinues -to build betweenlthe two

schools.

”Pitt and Penn State is a big
rivalry, and everyone is up for it.
it's played tough year in and year
out,” said Thomas.

”What happened last year may

affect the game early, but it will
probably wear out,” he added.

Thomas may be a junior, but
already he has proven he can
continue Penn State's rich run-
ning tradition.

Who knows, maybe next year
he may make those other Penn
State rushers only a distant
memory.

- box come kickoff, so efforts-to-

impress will be in order for both
teams.

Thegame will only be Gott-
fried’s second crack at a Paterno-
coached outfit. Of course, most
remember, or have tried to forget,
the rude awakening Gottfried
received last season upon in-
troduction to the Pitt—PSU rivalry
— a 34-1 4 headslap. Sure QB Joe
Felitsky had Pitt leading 7-3 late
in the first quarter, but scatback
Blair Thomas snapped the Pan-
thers’ back with a 91-yard kick-
off return and touche. Felitsky
injured his back, and Pitt never
recovered.

Then there was the incident,
the infamous massage parlor
melee that broke out after State
already had the Panthers in the
bag.tTempers flared, even be-
tween coaches. But as both Gott-

fried and Paterno will admit,
that's become old hat as time's
gone by. _

’’I haven't seen [Paterno] since
last year's game, but i have no
hard feelings toward him," com-
mented Gottfried. "Not only is
Penn State a rival, but it's a very
successful program as well. We
have a lot of respect for them be-
cause of that."

begin with,” said Paterno. ’’If he
was offended by what happened
last year, well, I'm sorry it had to
be that way. But I have a lot of
respect for what he's doing for
their program.”

Respect? Granted, Paterno is
indeed a living legend, and Gott-
fried has done an impressive job
in revamping the downtrodden
Panthers of the mid-'80s. But, like
it or not, as the saying goes, ”No
one ever forgets where they bu-
ried the hatchet.” Throw in those
bowl implications, and we've got
ourselves a war.

The most interesting matchup
on paper seems to evolve from

sitions. For the Panthers, Craig
”lronhead” Heyward leads the
attack, as well as the nation in
rushing yards (1236). The junior

tailback — although Paterno has

a hard time relating that term to
a ”277-pound” football player —
has been the mainstay of the Pitt
offense, sometimes to the point of
exhaustion.

Paul Brown, owner of the Cin-
cinnati Bengals and former coach
of the Cleveland Browns, once
said of his constant usage of su-
perstar tailback Jim Brown, ’’If
you have a big gun, shoot it.”

Such is Gottfried’s method in
employing Heyward. But you

defense, notorious for having its
way with Heisman-type backs,
will be looking for ”lronhead’s”
antics late into the evening.

Last year, Heyward produced
only 27 yards on 12 ‘carries

Penn State counters with the
exciting Thomas, a runner in the

yards per carry is among the best
in the NCAA.

  OFFENSIVE MA'|'CI-I-UPS

QUARTERBACK2 Pitt's Darnell Dickerson will be starting

only his second college game. While the cannon-armed Dickerson
has Panther fans, coaches and players excited, his two-game stats (16
completions in 42 attempts) are relatively poor. However, Dicker-
son adds another dimension to the Pitt attack because of his running
ability. In short, he gives defenses another player to worry about be-
sides Craig "lronhead" Heyward.

Penn State counters with senior Matt Knizner who has been some- J

what maligned in Happy Valley this year. Knizner’s most glaring
weakness is the fact he has thrown more interceptions (9) than touch-
down passes (7). What Knizner lacks in talent, though,-he more than

makes up for with experience. Plus, he's your typical Penn State quar- '

terback —— big and smart with a strong arm, although not great pass-
ing ability. And don't forget, Nittany Lion quarterbacks aren't
necessarily great players, but they're winners. Take a look at John
Shaﬁen

Dickerson may have more ability than Knizner, but experienced
quarterbacks usually _win football games, and Pitt doesn't have one.

Advantage: Penn State 3-1 L
RUN NING BACKS: Both teams possess a truly great run-

ning back, although, each has a different style. The Nittany Lions have
junior Blair Thomas, a speed burner who changed the complexion
of the Pitt game last year with a kickoff return for a touchdown. —

The Panthers attack is based on strength, not speed. Craig "Iron-
head" Heyward, whose weight is reportedly closer to 275'pou’nds
than the 260 pounds he is listed at, is a punishing player.

While Thomas has the big—pIay capabilities, Heyward is a player
who gets stronger as the game goes on, and he can wear down tough
defenses. Just ask the Miami Hurricanes.

But the main problem is Gottfried uses Heyward too much. Penn
State's defense will be able to key on him. Last year the Lions held
Heyward to 27 yards. '

Paterno's attack is more versatile. He uses more backs, therefore
he can keep Thomas fresh so Pitt won't be able to contain him the
entire game. Sorry, Ironhead, but 

Advantage: Penn State 4-2
RECEIVERS: Thomas and Heyward are both solid receivers
out of the backfield. Penn State and Pitt have quality receivers. The
problem is their respective quarterbacks don't get them the ball fre-
quently enough.

The key element that is advantageous to Penn State is their long—.

bomb abilities. Mike Alexander, Michael Timpson and Ray Round-
tree (24.8 yards per catch) are all capable of going deep. However,
Roundtree is probable for the game with a knee injury.

Meanwhile Pitt's receivers are possession-type players. The only
deep threat is Hosea Heard — and he's caught only five passes all
season.

Advantage: Penn State 4-2 _

LINEMENI The Nittany Lions have two senior starters, while
Pitt has only one. Both teams have had solid line play all season.
The Panthers’ Mark Stepnoski is the best among the bunch.

Penn State's troubles lie in the fact starters Stan Clayton (knee) and
Mike Wolf (hamstring) are ailing. Both should be able to play, though.

Once again, the Lions get the edge. The reason? Pitt's line has been
penalized in too many critical situations this year.

Advantage: Penn State 3-2
KICKING GAME! Not much to say here. After a stellar fresh-

, man season, Pitt's Jeff VanHorne has been a victim of the sophomore

jinx. He's kicked only nine of 18 field goals, although, he did boot
a 40-yard game winner at West Virginia. Penn State's regular kicker

. Eric Etze (seven for 10 this season) may return to action this week

after being out with an ankle injury. If not, Ray Tarasi (one for two
on the season) will start.
Advantage: Penn State 2-1
£   
The rivalry game is important to the fans and

J for recruiting. In state, there are a lot of dimen-

sions that go with this ballgame. [Penn State] is
not only a rival, but a respected program.

neeeuslve MATCH-UPS

LINEMEN: The Nittany Lions have three senior starters in Pete

Curkendall, Aoatoa Polamalu and Matt Johnson. The three have com-

bined for 14 sacks.
Pitt counters with a four-man front consisting of freshman Marc

Spindler, two juniors (Tony Siragusa and Burt Grossman) and senior s

Jon Carter. The four have combined for only 13 sacks, but the Pan-.
thers’ blitzing defense is designed for the linebackers to get the sacks.
The Nittany Lions and Panthers are both tough teams against the
run. Penn State has the edge with experience, but, remember, Pitt's
playing at home. »
Tie: 3-3
LINEBACKERS: Pitt linebacker Ezekial Gadson has outstand-
ing speed and quickness, helping him achieve a new Pitt record of
21 ‘/2 sacks through nine games. Strong side linebacker Jerry Wall has
played well all year, but middle linebacker Jerry Olsavsky (who plays
at a light 212 pounds) can be exploited. -
Penn State's always been called Linebacker U., but injuries have
decimated the strength of this year's corps. Trey Bauer, Keith Karpin-
ski, and Pete Giftopoulos will all play, but each one has beenin-
jured at some point this season.
Still, the Lions are strong at this position, but Gadson's extraordi-
nary ability gives the Panthers the edge.
Advantage: Pitt 4-3 _ .

 SECONDARY: Injuries haunt the Lions oncelagain. 

' Marques Henderson (ankle) and cornerback Eddie Johnson (ankle)

are still questionable for the game.

Pitt starts three seniors and a fourth senior (free safety Teryl Austin)
gets a lot of playing time. The Panthers only give up 123 yards a game
passing, and corner Gary Richard is excellent on man-to-man
coverage.

Penn State yields .235 passing yards" per game. i '

The only statistic in Penn State's favor is interceptions. The Nitta-
ny Lions have picked off nine passes, while Pitt has intercepted only
five. But that's nit-picking now, isn't it?

Advantage: Pitt:4-2 .

PUNTING GAME: John Rasp averages 39.9 yards per kick,
while Penn State's Chris Clauss averages 41.7 per punt. There's noth-
ing of interest here.

Tie: 1-1

INTANGIBLES: This is what wins football games. Obvious- _

Iy Paterno’s experience and record gives him an edge over Gottfried.
Furthermore, Penn State knows how to win. They may have an oc-
casional off-game, but they usually win anyway. '

While Penn State has defeated the teams it should have, Pitt has
lost to two teams (Boston College and Temple) it should have blown
out.

Traditionally, the Panthers _play far belowtheir ability in this game
and they find a way to lose — or tie. Remember the way Penn State
snuck out of Pitt Stadium with a 24-24 tie back in '83.

Advantage: Penn State 4-1

PREDICTION
Penn State 29, Pitt 21

Pitt hasn't beaten the Nittany Lions at Pitt Stadium since 1965.
Sorry, Panthers, but you'll have to wait two more years.

66

Pitt is Pitt. We can play other big games, but
the Pitt game has been the big game for the 37
years I've been at Penn State. This is my 38th Pitt
game and everyone of them"is exciting, intense

and emotional. We have never played Pitt when .

I didn't think we weren't in for a dogfight. ldon’t
think there's any game that's more Intense than
this one. I
