Chairman Releases Opening Date

Gt Annual Student lCG Conclave

Delegates to the sixth annual In-9

tercollegiate Conference on Govern-
ment will convene in Harrisburg
from April 21 to 23, it was announc-
ed today by Miss Genevieve Blatt,
executive director of the student leg-
islative conclave.

Organized in 1934 by Miss Blatt,
C33 and L36, and John P. Bracken,
C33, the conferences supplement
classroom study of American govern-
ment by providing students with the
opportunity to participate in model
governmental activities.

Establishment of executive head-
quarters in 445 Cathedral was also
announced this week. Miss Blatt
will direct all conference activity
from here, and will be assisted by
Dorothy Dresser, C39, her secre-
tary.

April’s conference will take the
form of a model unicameral legisla-
tive assembly, says the director. She
urges any University student who is
interested in taking part in mock
governmental procedure to attend
meetings of the local delegation.

“The ﬁrst call for membership in
the University delegation will be is-
sued at the beginning of the next
semester,” declares Saul Dizenfeld,
C39, vice chairman of last year’s
group.

Y Laboratory Features
Speech by Rev. Wooils

Continuing their policy of informal ~
Yul’- .

questions and answers the
YMCA will hold a weekly religious
laboratory period today at 2:30
o’clock in the Swedish Room, 135
Cathedral.

Leader of the discussion will be
Rev. Wayne Woods of the St. John’s
Lutheran Church of Pittsbxirgh.

Rev. Woods was the speaker at the;

Heinz Chapel Christmas service.

Co-chairmen of the religious lab-
oratories are Flizabeth Brunk, C40,
and Robert Shissler, Ed40.

Dizenfeld states that student'speak-
ers will explain the details of the
conference to various campus groups
in an effort to tear down the miscon-
ception that participation is limited
to political scinece majors or upper-
classmen.

“This is one of the few activities
where freshman students are consid-
ered on an equal basis with juniors
or seniors,” he explains.

During the year in which the Gen-
eral Assembly of Pennsylvania holds
its regular sessions, the ICG sponsors
model unicameral assemblies which
are held in the state capitol buildings
and the Education Forum in Harris-
burg.

In the intervening years the con-
ference dramatizes some other form
of governmental activity that seems
appropriate at the time. In 1934, a
model constitutional convention was
called. In 1936, the presidential elec-
tion year, a model political conven-
tion was held. Last year it met as
a model conference of states’ gover-
nors.

Local Results

Iiniversity students who were
interviewed in coiinection with
the Student Opinion S111'veys of
America went. on record as fav-
oring the President ‘s roi1r1na-
ment. program.

Of the 60 persons quizzed, 57
aiiswcred the question. Thirt_v-
seven, or 64.9 per cent of the
group, favored an increased
army and iiavy. It is interest-
ing to note that while men fav-
ored the proposal 26 to 12, only
11 out; of the 19 women wanted
incre:-ised ar1nament.s.

Coss Promises
More Elevators,

New Schedule

Added Cars to Insure
Better Floor Service

Complete elevator service with six
automatic and two hand cars within
the next week is guaranteed, accord-

building and grounds.

The service will run on a schedule
which was devised after the depart-
ment checked ﬂoor loads and ﬂoor
trips on all regularvstops of the ca-
thedral for a period of nearly two
months. A week was spent on each
floor so that accurate comparison
results could be taken, Mr. Coss said.

According to the new elevator
schedule, the local service will ;run
from_ the ground to the ﬁrst, ﬁfth,
eighth, eleventh, twelfth, fourteenth,
sixteenth and eighteenth ﬂoors. The
express cars» will run from . the
ground and ﬁrst ﬂoors to the eight-
eenth, twenty—ﬁrst,. twenty-fourth,
twenty-seventh, and thirtieth ﬂoors.

All cars stop at the regular ﬂoors
on the down trip, but do not stop on
the ﬁrst. However,~the express cars
will drop at local ﬂoors on the down
trip only on rush hours calls. After 5
o’clock the elevators stop on any
ﬂoor.

Elevators will not stop on all ﬂoors
in order to speed up the service.
“Although the installation of the two
new express cars does not directly
relieve the local car traffic load, by
relieving the down trips on the local
cars this service will be improved,”
Coss stated.

Cars at present are running from
the ground and ﬁrst ﬂoors at the rate
of one pe-r minute. Every six minutes
two express cars and four local cars
start trips. It is expected when the
new cars are placed in service, eight
cars will leave every six minutes, at
the rate of three express cars and
ﬁve locals.

As Pre-requisite

students will begin on Wednesday,
February 1, and continue through
Saturday, February 4, according to
E. A. Batchelder, assistant registrar.
The plans inaugurated last February
will be followed again this year.

Study lists must be secured at the
registrar’s ofﬁce, 1817 Cathedral, by
all undergraduate students, except
evening, late afternoon and graduate
students.

These forms are available from
Monday to Wednesday, inclusive.
They will determine the registration
appointment of the students. The
office will be open for this service on
each of these days from 8 a. m. to
noon and from 1 to 4 p. m.

Numbered Study Lists

On application to the oﬁice, stu-
dents will receive a study list bear-
ing a number which will correspond
to a deﬁnite time listed on the back
of the form. The hours scheduled
for registration must be strictly ad-
hered to.

On the study list students will
write both the first semester schedule
and their proposed second semester
ischedule. This form does not re-
lnlace the ﬁnal registration blank to
the ﬁlled in on February 1st to Feb-
E ruary 4th.

; “It is imperative that all students

4 have their study list with them when
they report to register. Students
‘Iwitheut. them will not be permitted
ito register,” advised Mr. Batchelder.
, The list must show any proposed
ichanges of schedule or sections since

Students are advised to schedule
the some sections as last semester. If
changes are made, it is necessaryto
have the head of the department sign
opposite the subject. The signatures
are to be obtained during, not before,
the registration period.

Study lists are used because “the

The earlier study lists are re-

The Students Speak

-On Rearumnneut

OLLEGE ymitli, this wcek’s Student Opinion
S1u've_v reveals, approvt-s of the Roosevelt ar-
mament. prograni by a niajoriliy of 62 per cent.

This majority voted in favor of the ])()licy of
strengthening “the United States army and ‘navy
for the protection of all nations in the \\’estcrn
Hem isphcre. ”

Thus American college students itnofﬁcially go
on record with the great American public in ap-
.provi11g' a furious “national clefonsc” progrant and
,patc1'nalistic P411-Americanism and give evidence
of being swept into the spirit of mass hysteria of
war preparation now prevailing throughout. the
nation.

VVe have no doubt that most of tlicsc studeiits are
sincere, that they view with alarm events in Europe
and Asia and South America which are fanning the
Martian ﬁres.

To a certain extent, we agree with tlicm that an
“‘a(lequate” national defense is necessary, for quite
obvious and practical reasons. But we believe that
the “joker” coines in with that word” “ade-
quate.” It has been interpreted in all niauucr of
magnitiule, has been stretched to impossible and
unnecessary proportions by organizations and in-
terests in favor of a super-inil.ita1-ism.

American college students. it seems. are being
engulfed in a wave of c_vnicis1n, are 2lU(3E])llll,(.f' the
inevitability of another great conﬂict, are blindly
rushing‘ into the present Administration’s hasty,
and, in many ways, ill-advised plans for 1'ea1'nia-
Inent. and mobilization.

Perliaps they are following the example set. by
the older generation, especially those a11gust' gen-
tlemeii now dclil)eratin,<_r; in the inusty halls of
Cong'1'css. At. the same time as these worthy legis-
lators are preparing to vote billions for na.tion_al
tlefciisc, tlicy are <lcliberatel_v slicing lnuidreds of
thou.~;ands off an already meagre relief appropria-
tion.

Of course, in this day and age, national defense
must always come before national welfare, mili-
tarism before civilization. Perliaps the new battle-
cry should be, “Billions for defense, but not one
cent. for lu1ma11it_v.”

‘Local Boy’
Fails To lwake ﬂood

Di R JOHN NANCE GARNER, who was given an
abortive buildup by Hearst in 1932, is being
boomed once more as the white hope of the mod-
erate and Sontliei-11 wing of the Democratic party.
Aside from lieiiig the leader of the take-it-easy
and-slay-in-power group of his party, Mr. Garner is
gciierally rcc.ogn.izc(l as one of the best stud poker
players. in America.

Accordingly. when l’niversity of Texas students
were asked to consider him as a choice for 1940.
they showed their familiarity with Mr. Garner and
the gziixie by giving him 34 per cent of their votes.

l‘*‘ort._v-nine and eiglll-lelltll per cent expressed a
pi'cfo1'c21cc for a more liberal New Dealer, and the
usual 16.2 per cent gave no opinion at all.

All of whicli lirin9.':; to our mind the old parable
of fainiliariit_v lii-cetliiig sonietliing or other. But of
course it ‘s just the radi<_‘-.al. intellectual element
which has this attitude.

No doubt ’l‘ex:-is Jack and his backers are plan-
ning to (’.:ll‘l')' t‘-1»;>ir llfllll to “the people" with an-
other of those Texas “hill-billy" campaigrns.

By jack Hoeveler

’T1's currently rumored that Pat Griﬁith’s double
date, Rex Williams, will be rolling east in a covered
wagon within the next couple of weeks Rex is
tipping the scales these days at a mere 225 lbs. and they
say Pat is afraid to put her arm around him for fear
of meeting someone else’s coming around the other side.

Up from Alabama comes Margaret Patterson who
won a prize for being the best proportioned girl in the
state . . the catch in this is that it was back in 1921
and she won a mahogany high chair.

Commons Room Court

Nancy Sundstrom climbs upon her throne in the
Commons at the 5th hour these days while her salon
fills with hopefuls who engage in a mutual back-stab-
bing fray . . all to cater to the little pink lady .

D. J. Bailey, Don Moses, and North Carolina’s Rudy
Holloman are worthy worshippers.

Karl “I’m an Independent” Stark shone across the
footlights last Sun. and Tues. as Spit in the ex-Broad-
way hit “Dead End” and has the critics raving?

Joe lVIazer’s made a grand gesture last wk. when he
set up the party for 165 St. Vincent De Paul orphans

. a little habit that we might recommend to some of
the other nite spots. We see Fran Durkin and Bob
Adams, two of “Mother Kairy’s Chickens,” huddling in
corners these days . . plotting a political comeback,
no doubt.

Ceramics Exhibit

By John Brosky

Originality, simplicity, and the harmonious blend of
striking colors are keynotes of the ceramics exhibition
now on display in the new art galleries, seventh floor,
Cathedral.

The exhibit, which is composed of contemporary
American ceramics selected from the Seventh National
Ceramic Exhibition, is circulated among universities
and art galleries of the United States by the Syracuse
Museum of Fine Arts. It will continue here until Jan-

ruary 23.

Included in the display are the works of some of the
top men in sculpture and of many up and coming can-
didates. Altogether, 83 artists are represented, with
contributions ranging from vases to ceramic plaques.

Schreckengost Leads

From the lot, “Glory, Glory,” “The Abduction,”. and
“Young Pegasus” by Viktor Schreckengost stand fore-
most on the “ﬁnest works” column. However, the piece
of ceramics in which cleverness of design and the eﬁect
of coloring tones are most dominating is the glazed
plaque, “Plantation,” by H. Edward Winter.

“Plantation” is a portrait of a slave girl, clothed in
a silvery-white dress with blue colored pleats at the
bottom and at the waistline. The pleats, instead of be-
ing depressed by glazed material at those sections, is
effected by the arrangement of blue and green. The
plaque is six feet long and four feet wide.

“Abduction” is portrayed by a nude "negro girl astride
a galloping bull; “Glory, Glory” is represented by four
negro women with their hands raised to the sky.

Satire In Ceramics

Not all the ceramics are serious in nature. “Foun—
tain Lunch,” Shirley Soderstrom, the three-dimension
naturalist, portrays a miniature replica of a soda bar
that one sees in any corner drug store.

“Fountain Lunch” is done in a bright reddish-orange
color. Three common types sit at the bar: a girl in her
“teens licks ice cream from her spoon; a man in overalls
sips from a bowl of soup; a fat lady sits erect and draws
soda through a straw while her Pekingese dog scuttles
at her feet.

Let us not forget, however, that the exhibition in-
cludes the works of Russel B. Aiken, Arthur E. Boggs,
Paul Bogatay, Sorcha Boru, Waylande Gregory, Maija
Gortell, Edgar Littleﬁeld, and Carl Waters.

Educational Methods

By Alice Benovit-z

Education seems to be taking a terrilﬁc beating these
days. what with the recent articles by Stephen Leacock
in the New York Times. -

Mr. Leacock’s complaint—and a very justifiable one
——is that education has developed into a marathon race.
Each year additional credits and courses are required of
potential professional men, teachers, social workers.
It has reached the point where a man is in his late twen-
ties or early thirties before he can even touch his pro-
fession.

Then for ten years, no one pays much attention to
him because he is too young. Just about the time he
figures that he has finally become established, the pub-
lic suddenly decides that he is an old fogy.

Mr. Leacock recalls with nostalgia the good old days
when a man was settled in his ﬁeld and married at the
age of 24. No doubt, the college man of today would
be satisﬁed with just the former.

Most teachers feel that education is rapidly ap-
proaching the time when it will become so top heavy
that it will collapse under its own weight. What with
fellowships, post-graduate courses, and multiple degrees,
a man could—in the realm of possibility—spend his
entire life in school, acquiring more and more theory
without the opportunity to apply it.

Mr. Leacock’s criticism is va1id—even though the
next educational reform probably will be a seven-year
undergraduate course.

Listen
To Me . . .

By  Karl Stark

It’s a rather messy world we are
living in today. Chaos and blood
cover a fourth of the world’s surface.
Nations vie with one another in de-

,fying inteznational law and perpe-

trating vicious atrocities.

It has all become a huge game
whose purpose is to grab the most of
what you want, with the least inter-
ference and complaint from those
most likely to call a bluff.

Tiny Japan waits for an opportune
moment when her traditional enemy,
Russia, is too busy with internal
plans and purges to be particularly
prepared for external squabbles, and
excitedly gobbles up great chunks of
China, while the rest of the world
stands around breathing hard,
watching from safe distance the
smouldering piles of death and de-
struction.

Incifectual Protestations

Italy awaits her chance, and in the
true spirit of ancient Rome, courage-
ously stampedes a handful of un-
armed Ethiopians.

“You can’t do that, we’ll . . .
we’ll . boycott you. Yes that’s
what we’ll do . you had men.”
Very pretty isn’t it?

Then Herr Hitler, the Austrian pa-
perhanger, as the British so appro-
priately call him, adroitly goes Brit-
ish, and snaps up Czechoslovakia in
the name of self expression and Ger-
man justice. And does it so well in
fact, as to get a go-ahead sign from
those who presumably controlled the
situation.

But all this is everyday news, has
been masticated and digested, and
now if it occasions any comment at
all it is only, “Isn’t it terrible the
things going on over there:” Yes it
is, but far more important is the
question, “What is it doing to us?”

‘M’ Propaganda

Every day in thousands of news-
papers from coast to coast, we are
being pounded by propaganda,
against the Japanese, the Germans,
the Italians, the Russians; our minds
are being ﬁlled with hate and mur-
der for the new order. Democracy
must live, they should die who would
destroy it.

Our minds are being set for that
great “V-M” day. We see pictures of
troops and tanks and airplanes; we
are shown the necessity for prepara-
tion. Our radios, and movies, and
publications produce a continuous
stream of hate.

All combine to create a picture, un-
believable by any decent humane in-
dividual; and yet, what are we to do‘?
We see it everywhere, we hear of it,
we read of it, everybody believes it.

Maintain Sane Outlook

But don’t you believe it; don’t let
your minds be inﬂuenced by it—it’s
not healthy; your whole attitude will
become colored. Your mental set
will ﬁt perfectly into the plans of
those who want you to be ready for
“Unser Tag,” our day. The whole
world, without exception, makes no
secret of regarding us as the goose
bound to deliver the golden egg.

And I say, keep your wind clear,
you have a home here, impregnable;
keep it for what it is and what it
should be. Propaganda is made for
a purpose, and you have no purpose
but peace.

Don’t play into their hands.
have no quarrel with any man.

Not That

It Nﬁatters . . .
By Gertrude Lieblzch

You

It’s funny how words seem to be
used in cycles. The present fad cen-
ters around “ideology.” For more
than 18 years we have never heard
the word; now it manages to pop up
six subjects a week.

There used to be a basis to things,
maybe a principle underlying them,
or a philosophy behind them, but not
any more. Eveything has its ideo-
logy.

Ideologies Rampant

“Ideology” isn’t a word you can
mumble. You have to enunciate it.
We can’t see why a person should
say, “I question your ideology on the
matter,” when all he means is,
“That’s what YOU think!”

“Isolation” is another that has
caused us to take notice, this time
because of the pronunciation. We’re
referring to the recent splurge of
“iSSolation.” Webster gives it his
blessing, and so it must be accepta-
ble.

Still, we can’t get used to the radi-
ator-hissing version of the word.
Maybe that’s because we’ve been
lCEolated so long.

Spineless Anomaly

We wonder how many other per-
sons object to having “anomaly”
slung at them ten times a day.
“Come again” is the only feeling we
can work up for “anomaly.” It
doesn’t seem to have the solid foun-
dation of hard “r’s” and “k’s” that a
word should have—a visible means
of support, as it were.

We’ve come to the stage where we
nod vehemently when we hear
“anomaly.” Sometimes, we even use
it. Do we know what it means? Of
course not.

Pitt Icers Trim Stubborn
Plaid In Last Minute, 1-O,
On Blood-Spattered Ice

Goalie F ieler Stars
As Wilson, Goldsmith, Block Are Hurt

By Bill McElwain
Don’t be surprised if, at the next. meeting of the Ohio-Pennsyl-
Vania Hockey League, the Carnegie Tech representatives demand that
a ﬁrst aid kit be made part of the standard equipment for a player
The Tartans could have used such kits to advantage last \'\'ednes-
-day evening as they lost to Pitt, 1-0, in the wildest, bloodiest game of

the season.

Wing Whitey Block, Defensemanﬁt

Goldsmith, and Defenseman Wilson
all took time out at various points in
the game to be taped, stitched or
bandaged.

In the absence of Coach John Mc-
Sorley, who was in Florida for his
father’s funeral, Captain Bob
Schooley piloted the Panthers and
gave personal attention to the scor-
ing of the lone goal with 40 seconds
remaining in the ﬁnal session.

Schooley Scores

The score came after Pitt had turn-
ed on the power with two minutes
to go. With Friday, Schooley, Brit-
tain, Shiring, and Broida all in the
Tech defense zone and taking shot
after shot at the Skibo net, Friday
ﬁnally slipped the disc to Schooley
and Bob shoved it past the frantic
Fieler at 11:20.

Up to the moment of the tally, the
Plaid partisans were nursing hopes
of a tie or even a win over the Pan-
thers. Devoid of anything resem-
bling an attack, Tech concentrated
on defense, poke checking and body
checking viciously to ruin most of
the Pitt drives.

Despite the alert work by the men
up front, there might have been a
different story to tell had not Fred-
die Fieler turned in another ﬁne per-
formance in the goal mouth for the
Kilties. Corning after Duquesne’s
Alex Iungerich had shut out John
Carroll 3-0 in sensational fashion,
Fieler’s feat made it goalie night
at the Garden.

Thirty-two Saves

Thirty two times the Mcsorley ma-
chine crashed through for shots at
the Tech net-minder and just as
often, Fred turned the puck aside. So
constant was the Pitt attack that
Goalie Ellis was required to save on
only eight occasions.

An additional factor to Pitt’s fail-
ure to hit the bell earlier was that,
despite the constancy and fury of
their offensive, the Panthers’ passing
was ragged and their stick-handling
erratic through most of the first two
periods. Not until the last 12 min-
utes did the Pittites smooth out most
of the rough spots.

'ped a crimson smear on his fore-

Defensively, Pitt clicked. All ﬁve
defensemen rode Tartan attackers
out of plays with neatness and thor-
oughness. Both lines played heads
up hockey, stealing the puck from
Tech men almost too easily. Unfor-
tunately, the Techs then stole it back.

Only twice did Tech show an of-
fensive spark. At 10:30 in the sec-
ond period, Schooley followed Bobby
Lowe into the penalty box with a
one minute sentence for checking
into the boards, and the Tartans
threw ﬁve wings at Ellis.

The ﬂurry collapsed less than a
minute later when Skibo Defense-
man Wilson went into the box for
interference. The second Tech
threat came after the Pitt score, but
the Jungle Cats were at full strength
and held out until the ﬁnal buzzer.

Artz Penalized

The blood spilled during the eve-
ning added considerably to the ex-
citement. Block was slashed by a
skate near the close of the ﬁrst pe-
riod, and returned to the ice only
after several stitches had been taken.
in the gash and a bulky bandage
wrapped around his head.

Irv Artz was handed a major pen-
alty for drawing blood in the sec-
ond session when the end of his
stick smashed against Goldsmitlfs
mouth and tore the big Tartan’s lip.
In the ﬁnal period Wilson was the
victim of a swinging stick which rip-

Bill Ruskin Shatters Scoring
Mark, Tallies 53 Points

In the Independent basketball di-9

vision the Pitt Club and the Arrows
scored decisive victories in last Tues-
day’s combats, while the Ramblers
nosed out the All-Stars, 19-17, in a
closely fought battle.

Bill Ruskin, the one man hurri-
cane who keeps the Pitt club in the
winner’s division, sparked his team-
mates to a 75-19 landslide over the
Kappa Alpha Psi’s.

Ruskin scored a total of 58 points,
which incidentally, is more than
Hank Lusetti’s world record of 52
points in one game. The KAPsi’s
never were in the game, the winners
grabbing an early lead and increas-

The Newman Club’s .500 point av-
erage was wiped out when the Ar-
rows came through with a 27-14 win.
Pearlman of the Arrows was the
main factor in the scoring with a
total of 9 points. Dunn led the los-
ers with 7 markers.

Ray Lighthouse, Senior Civil En-

9 The wallowing Pitt Panthers’

will try to regain their ﬁrm win-
ning basketball ways when they
meet the undefeated \Vestn1inster
ﬁve tomorrow night. at the Sta-
diuin.

The Titans will be staking their
position as the district’s leading cage
team while the Panthers, in their

can leap back to the district forefront
with a win.
South Aces

Westminster has already defeated
Geneva, Carnegie Tech, Slippery
Rock, and Grove City, and move into
Pittsburgh for the second week-end
in succession, with a starting combi-
nation of veterans and freshmen,
headed by high scoring Mel Meller,
and Joe Spak, former South High
star.

A year ago the Titans, playing their
first year under Grover VVashabaugh,
former South mentor, defeated Pitt
for the ﬁrst time since the resumption
of the series. Previous to that time
favored Westminster quintets under
Johnny Lawther had gone down to
defeat four times before Pitt attacks.

Veteran Mel Meller and Stan
Vvasik, a freshman from South, have
been leading the Westminster attack
thus far, aided and abetted by Joe
Spak, Wasik’s high school teammate.
Juniors Jim Wilson and Joe I-letra
complete the invader’s attack.

Westminster’s victory over Carne-
gie Tech, the lone defeat accumu-
lated by this season’s Tartans, adds
spice to the game—-if the game needs
spice. Tech, if you have already for-
gotten, is the squad that eliminated
Pitt last Tuesday with a 55-50 count.

Pitt has been concentrating the
past two days on reshaping a defense,
which has been far from potent all
season, and which very neatly top-
pled against the fast breaking Tech
offense. '

Line-up Retained

Coach Carlson is not likely to re-
juggle his line-up because of the poor
‘defensive exhibition shown by the
‘Panthers in the Tech game. The
Paifrath, Klein, Port, Kocheran, and
Johnson combine will probably get
another chance against Westminster.

Meanwhile the sophomores con-
tinue to spark the Pitt attack, with
Larry Paffrath of Butler leading all
Imarksmen. Larry has plunked the
bell on 36 occasions, and converted
nine free throws for an 81 point total.
Trailing him in order are George
Kocheran, Mel Port, Jimmy Klein,

the Tech game accounted for ten
Panther points.

Tartans Do t
Again; Trounce
Pitt Floormen

The bloodless revolution in Oak-
land continued Tuesday night as
Carnegie’s Tartans added their sec-
ond sports triumph of the year over
Pitt Panthers Tuesday night at the
‘Tech Gym.

Following the trail laid open to
them by their football classmates,
the Tech basketballers come through
‘with a 55-50 victory.

Actor Combs received numerous
curtain calls as a result of his excel-
lent performance bringing hilarious
shouts from the Tech critics with
seven ﬁeld goals and connecting with
two out of four charity tosses.

Pitt Leads

Sharing the lead was tall “Rube”
.Stark, Plaid center and captain. The
Tartan leader duplicated Combs’ in
every conceivable manner even com-
mitting the same number of personal
fouls as his teammate.

Tech scored “first blood” as its
stage star swished a two-pointer
through the net in the opening sec-
ond of play. Pitt went ahead 4-2 as
George Kocheran and Larry Paffrath
put away two set shots. This was
the only time in the game that the
“elimination” ﬁve held the lead.

Tech had little diﬁiculty slipping
away from Pitt’s man to man defense
;and made the majority of its shots
;from under the basket. The Panth-
fers found the Tech defense above
par and were forced to abandon the
fast break which has brought suc-
cess thus far and ﬂing long shots
from all parts of the ﬂoor.

Vujnovic Clicks

Larry Paifrath continued to lead
the Panther attack, hitting the hoop
lﬁve times with double-deckers and
making good on two out of three at-
tempts from the foul line.

Danny Vujnovic was good for ten
points.

Carnegie led 24-18 at half-time.
This was cut down to 24-21 as John
Pataky dropped in a ﬁeld goal at
the opening of the second half and
'was fouled in the act of shooting. He
was awarded a penalty toss and

Paced by the lanky Stark who con-
tributed ﬁve ﬁeld goals during the
second half, the Tartans attached
themselves to a twenty—ﬁfth century
rocket and jumped ahead of the
Panthers, 41-27, to coast into vic-
tory.

The Suspense

 

was Jtwlul !

It was a pretty sad week-end at ﬁrst with exam
grades being given out back at college and no
one knowing the results. But Archie stepped
right up with that amazing intelligence of his.
He simply turned to the telephone, called the
school and soon had the facts for us. It was

good news for all, so then the fun began!

Smart college people seldom stay uncertain.

They let the telephone relieve their minds-

quickly, easily, inexpensively.

Rates on most Long Distance 
calls are reduced every night
after 7 and all day Sunday.

Methods of Study

By Lewis Riley

“\\'e need a different slant on
this examination business . ”

Thus Dr. Omar C. Held, person-
nel assistant to the dean of the
College, reviewed the topic of the
hour as 5000 University under-
graduates today swing into ﬁnal
preparation for mid-year examina-
tions to begin next Friday. '

“Cram, slide through the examina- '
tion, sell the book, and the course is
closed” constitutes the typical stu-
dent viewpoint, Dr. Held believes.
He points out that examinations
should be viewed as “yardsticks of
achievement of far greater value to
the student than to the instructor,”
rather than as the end of the road.

Serve As Guideposts

“Examinations should be encour-
aging guideposts of one’s relative
ability in his various chosen ﬁelds of
study. They should prompt further
advancement in the ﬁelds for which
one is found best adapted and should
provide also an impetus of renewed
struggle along less favorable lines.”

Not only students, but educators as
well, fall within the scope of Dr.
Held’s observations.

“The examination is too much of a
hurdle set up under the present-day
educational system as a court of ﬁnal
jurisdiction handing down irrevoca-
ble condemnations of inferiority in
the form of failing grades.”

“Education,” he asserts, “is the
goal, not the passing of a test. The
educational process, however, is gar-
nished at present in waves of con- _ _
ﬂicting quality points, grades, and ex- Phi, formerly ‘treasurer, will hold the
aminations; thus we lose sight of ou C0mbi1'1€d Office Of Secretary and

hour.

Question Yourself

2. Anticipate; try your hand at
formulating examination questions.
There are comparatively few sorts of
questions which can intelligently and
fairly be asked about the work of a
single course.

3. Collaborative study has its de-
cided advantages but only if organ-
ized. The usual haphazard discus-
sions should be replaced with the in-
terchange of systematically formu-
lated lists of ten or 20 questions.
Very special or elusive topics should
be “farmed out” for further discus-
sion.

4. Train for your examinations.
Do not interrupt your regularity of
habits-—particularly in the case of
sleep. Physical and mental ﬁtness is
always of prime importance to the
student; as the examination period
approaches make it of especial con-
cern.

THE PITT N EWS

Pitkin Leader
Addresses Club

,On Anniversary

I Celebrating the twenty-ﬁfth anni-
I; versary of the founding of the Pitkin
,Club, non-sectarian student organi-
;‘ zation, approximately 300 alumni and
the present membership will attend
a vesper service at Shadyside Presby-
terian church this Sunday at 4
o’clock.

Dr. Hugh Thomson Kerr, pastor
of the church and leader of the club

for 25 years, will deliver a special

message to Pitkin members. Twelve
hundred other alumni will hear the
program over KDKA.

A special Pitkin Club service, at
which Chancellor John G. Bowman
will be speaker, will be held in the
chapel of the Shadyside Presbyterian
church at 5 o’clock. Following this
service a buffet luncheon will be
served in the dining room of the
church at 5:30 o’clock.

A committee headed by Walter J.
Rome, BA26, superintendent of the
Allegheny County juvenile detention
home, has invited all the members of
the club for the past 25 years to at-
tend the services. Dr. Joseph P.
Harvey, C39, wil speak during the
program.

Pitkin Club was organized in De-
cember 1913 after a group of 11 Uni-
versity students attended a religious
convention at Kansas City. They or-
ganized to continue their study of
the mission ﬁeld.

Susan Sharp Waddell, Medl9, who
inaugurated the movement on the
campus, later died in China while
doing mission work. Through the ef-
forts of Elizabeth Martin, MedO2, the
group secured Dr. Kerr as its leader.
The club was named for Horace C.
Pitkin, a young medical ofﬁcer killed
in the Boxer rebellion.

Since the club’s organization, mem-
bers have met weekly in the Shady-
side church for luncheon—discussion
meetings. The club program has
broadened to include basic Christian
truths and ways of life as well as
mission work.
