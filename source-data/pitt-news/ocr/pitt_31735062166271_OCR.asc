Regulations For  

Eligibility, Process
By JIM MARINO

“K Procedure and eligibility
regulations have been an-
1‘ nounced in detail by the free
p o 1 i o inoculation program
committees of the University.

All full time and part—time

students in all areas—~undergradu-
ate, graduate and professional-
are eligible for the University
program.

The plan for faculty and em-
ployees is limited to those”’ern-
ployed full time. However, all full-
time faculty and employees are
eligible to have thier wives, hus-

._ bands and children inoculated.

Students under 21 are requir-
ed to have a written indication
of parental consent to show at
the time of inoculation. Although
the incidence of polio for those
over 40 is low, all employees
no matter what their age are
urged to receive the inoculations.
Children of all ages will be
vaccinated.

Medical teams will give ﬁrst in-
oculations in the Commons Room
on Feb. 27 and 28 and Mar. 1 and
2. The teams will be equipped to
handle 600 inoculations each hour.

Each person eligible for the
shots will be requested to indicate
ﬁve half-hour periods during
which he will be free to be in-
oculated on IBM cards which he

a will receive this week.

These cards are to be sent
back to the committee which will
sort and select appointments for
each person.

Volunteers Needed
To Help in Mass

Inoculation Drive

Approximately 20,000 people
are expected to be inoculated
in the current free vaccina-
tion program at Pitt. In order
to expedite inoculation pro-
cedures, volunteer help will
be needed.

The following statement issued

by Dean Biddle, chairman of the
administrative — promotional com-

mittee, explains the immediate
situation.
“We invite faculty, faculty

wives and clerical staff to help
us. We need faculty members to
serve as special administrators
at the Inoculation Center morn-
—ings, afternoons and evenings.

' We need wives and clerical staff

to serve as attendants at the

Information Center and as re-

corders in the inoculation area.”
Students may also sign up for

-work in the processing and dis-

tribution of appointment cards.

Anyone interested in helping to
prove to the nation that mass
inoculations are practical and can
be handled efficiently may volun-
teer by calling the Dean of Men’s

‘ Coronation Stopped

By Commission Vote

By BARBARA

CHERINGTON

Last Wednesday night, WSGA commission voted to end
a thirty-one year—old tradition.

Chief Justice of Senior Court Sue Biddle read two reso-
lutions resulting from several joint meetings of Senior Court

and senior class cabinet members.

The resolutions read:

Resolved that the ceremony of Coronation be dis-

continued.

Be it further resolved that
there be no selection of a Sen-
ior Queen or any comparable
recognition of individual senior
women sponsored by the Wom-
en’s Self Government Associa-
tion. =

Voting, after discussion on both
resolutions, was 15 voted for, three
voted against on the ﬁrst resolu-
tion, and seven voted for, nine
voted against on the second.

At a revote taken on the second
resolution eleven voted for and
four against.

Over 18 non-voting persons were
present and took part in the dis-
cussion. These people
members of the women’s senior
class and Commission advisors.

Statement Read

In presenting reasons behind
these resolutions, Sue Biddle read
from a statement prepared and
signed by Senior Court and senior
class cabinet members.

Recognition was made, ﬁrst, of
“the contribution of Coronation

. . in enriching the life of wom-
en at the University . . . in serv-
ing as a public relations instru-
ment with alumnae and the com-
munity . . . in keeping with the
consistent high standard in the
selection of past Queens, and in
inﬂuencing individual and group
life.”

Justiﬁcation of the ﬁrst reso-
lution to discontinue Coronation
included the statements that “in
current life each student has
imposed upon her choices which
she did not have to make in
former years; many students in
odr generation are marrying be-
fore or immediately following
graduation; jobs are more read-
ily available; and more travel is
possible. Therefore the compe-
tition in interest for the inter-
vening time (of Coronation rc-
hearsals between Commence-
ment and Coronation) is far
keener than previously.”

“Secondly,” the statement read,
“we respond to simpled forms of
expression than the Coronation
provides. In addition, since the
symbols of Coronation are not sig-
niﬁcant of American tradition,
they do not carry forcefully to
their originally intended meaning."

Selection Seen Unwise

In justification of the second
resolution, the report of Court and
cabinet “questioned the wisdom of
attempting to select any one per-
son or group. of individuals to
represent what we most value in a

_University senior woman.”

The conclusion of reasons for
the second resolution was that “no

revised the by-

It was decided to expand the commission from four to
five members, elected, as before, by the fraternity men at
large. The distribution will be three seniors, one junior, and

one sophomore.

The reasoning involved in over-
loading the group with seniors is
that they are less subject to po-
litical pressures than underclass—
men. The chairman will be elected
from within the group with the
one provision that he be a senior.

He will be an ex-ofﬁcio mem-
ber of IF Council to insure close
rapport between IF and the
commission. No oﬂicer of IF may
be elected justice.

The penalties which may be is-
sued were not outlined in the new
plan in order to give the group a
wider scope. The Council of Fra-
ternity Presidents was deleted as
an appellate body. Any appeal of
a decision rendered by the com-
mission must now be sent directly
to the administration.

The Council, which has not been
called upon to function on an ap-
peal thus, far, is too deeply mired
in fraternity politics, petty jeal-

 

ousies and personal bias to be an

effective intermediary, according
to the consensus of IF;

The ﬁnal basic change was to
have these by-laws included in
the IF constitution which will
have the effect of making the
judicial body an agency rather
than a committee of IF Council.

The basis for the changes was
the precedent set by the commis-
sion in their two decisions.

Those on the commission be-
licved that their recommendations
for change were a step forward
for the fraternity system.

Reed Harper, Col. ’57, president
of IF, reported to the group on
the work of National .Interfrater-
nity Conference. The delegates
came to the conclusion, Harper
stated, that fraternities must
“share and express the ideas and
mutual problems of the univer-
sity” in order to remain intact in
the enlarged university of tomor-
row. ‘C

well under construction.

Here, engineers and scientists will soon
be hard at work dealing with new and in-

this newest section of the Pratt & Whitney

design, testing and development of highly
advanced, extremely powerful jet engines
which will join a family already including
J—57 and J—75 turbojets, currently playing
important roles in the growing military and
commercial air power of the Unitedbstates.

The engineering graduate who begins his
career at this Florida facility will have the
rare opportunity of keeping pace with its
anticipated growth. In an organization re-

PolioObjectiveCited

Dr. Bisel To Head
Medical Area of

Inoculation Drive
By ED BACHIVIAN

The University of Pitts-
burgh can well be considered
the center of a whirlpool-—-a
ﬁghting whirlpool against the
dreaded paralytic polio, which
up to a short time ago had po-

tential to strike down any man,
woman or child.

But now Pitt is spearheading a
war against polio. This is a war
which can be won, but only if the

“nation follows the lead of Pitt and

the Allegheny County Medical So-
ciety.

The eyes of other medical so-
cieties will be on this county and

its drive against polio. Skepticism

has greeted the proposed effective-
ness of a mass clinic to give polio
shots, such as will be initiated in
our Commons Room, beginning
Feb. 27.

Cooperation Essential
The only ones who can prove
the effectiveness of this event will
be the 20,000 students, faculty and

.. employees of Pitt. They must co-

operate, for this cooperation is the
essential point for this war against
polio to spread throughout the rest
of the nation.

Pitt is attempting to prove
two main objectives through its
polio shot drive: 1) to get every-
one in its university family in-
inoculated before the 1957 polio,
season this summer; and 2) to
show that innoculation can be
done on a mass basis.

In its efforts to pave the way
throughout the nation, Pitt is well
aware of some astounding facts
proved since the initiation of the
vaccine developed by our own Dr.
Jonas A. Salk. ‘

If everyone under 20 years of
age can be given the three shots,
then 75% of all potential polio
will be wiped out completely; if
shots are given to all under 30
years of age, 90% will be elimin-
ated; and if all under 50 years of
age is innoculated, then 98% of
all potential polio will be elimin-
ated.

Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
< ﬁeld, who is co-chairman in the
county drive with Dr. Leo P.

Sheedy, President of the Alle-
gheny County Medical Society,
has selected very effective ma-
chinery to direct the Pitt phase
of this war against polio.

In charge of the many head-
ache—ladden administrative area
will be Theodore W. Biddle, dean
of men, who needs little introduc-
tion to the University. Running

  Jain Tlre Figlt t

A positive step ‘forward has been taken by the Uni-

iversity in the ﬁght against crippling polio. The ﬁrst planned

all out attack on the disease is about to be launched.
Loading this attack is a family of 20,000 people who will

be inoculated free of charge in the coming weeks and will 0

show the way for the nation in taking the aggressive against
polio.

Of course, the largest single block of inoculations will

be given to the undergraduate full—time students. Therefore
the greatest responsibility for the accomplishment of the
mission lies in the hands of these students.

Since national press and television services will be
focused on the Commons Room during the inoculations, the
University will be provided with the means of showing the
nation———and perhaps, as Chancellor Litchﬁeld has indicated,
the whole world—-the pattern to follow in mass vaccina-
tions. '

The means of publicizing success, as is often the case,
can also be the means of broadcasting failure. The outcome

_'depends on the students.

. Only-by turning out in full force and showing a ﬁghting
enthusiasm for the campaign will the students insure its

success. When the cameras click and roll, they must record

an orderly procession of thousands of eager participants.

Faculty and employees and their children share this
responsibility- Legislation is now pendingin the Pennsyl-
Vania government which will make it mandatory for every
child entering public schools in the state to have been inocu-
lated against polio. The convenience of the Pitt program
will make it easy to ready a family for such laws. Chil-
dren of .all ages will be vaccinated.

It is possible for students, faculty and employees to

(aid in the tremendous task of administration of the pro-

gram. Already faculty wives, student organizations and
clerical staff members have pledged to work in the handling
of the procedural jobs in the program.

It should be gratifying to know that the program was
launched, administered and participated in by the entire
University community without aid from any outside agen-
cies. This planning will prove beyond the shadow of doubt
that such a mass inoculation program can be efficiently
handled by the personnel of any large institution.

But here again the burden of responsibility lies with
the students. Volunteers are needed in a multitude of small
jobs. The kind of jobs that will probably be ‘unnoticed by
the majority but will be necessary to get the program off

. the ground. .

I Men’s Council has led the way in pledging its whole-
hearted support in the form of near 90 man hours of work
at what MC president Ron Sobel has termed stamp—licking
chores. Many other student organizations have also urged
their members to participate in the volunteer work plan.

Anyone who is interested in this work may volunteer
by calling University extensions302 or 311.

If things work out well at Pitt it may mean that the
nation will be rousedfrom its present apathy toward the
ﬁght against polio. Scientists have reckoned that some 90
per cent of the class of polio otherwise expected for this
year can be eliminated if a mass inoculation program is
adopted by organizations across the country,

or In other words, this dread crippler and killer can be
almost wiped out in a single year. The ﬁght is certainly
a worthy one. It will take a significant effort by a significant

-institution to set the pace. The University has recognized
its responsibility to ﬁll that -position. The rest is up to us. ~ I

 

 

   

Second Look;
D   "

(Editor’s Note: This is the second in a series,,of
columns on the impressions of Pitt after one
semester by Jay Butler, recipient of the 1956
Writers Scholarship.)

‘ By Jay Butler ’

It is a vague dissatisfaction because it is com-
plex. The feelings which I have now are no less
snarled and complicated by endless qualiﬁcations
no less chary of adequate deﬁnition than the com-
plex of problems that now faces the University of
Pittsburgh.

That the individual student
learning experience in the nar-
row ‘light of mere vocational
training is no doubt one 'of the
reasons for failure to accomplish
the education of the TOTAL
man. That he tends to limit his
vocational objectives early in his
education is another. I was dis-
turbed by the comment by a
member of our faculty that,
“Anyone who stays in the Col-
lege is a fool.” ,

His belief that the primary objective of edu-
cation is to “learn a trade,”--although no doubt
largely true, is characteristic of a preoccupation
with the purely functional aspects of education, but
in allowing it to crowd itself into every corner

often views his

 

of our c o n s c i o u s effort, we have unwittingly

fostered the growth of a massive system, a_ma—
chinery, which threatens to destroy the educational
process.
Student at Fault

That the student himself is largely at fault is
no doubt true. But the ‘cries of our industry and
government for educated men and women, not to
mention the University’s own obligation to those
whom it admits to its program, do not allow us
to drop the problem of his welfareat that, in the
lap of the student. We must apply to the machine
itself for an answer. As the classroom is the basic
unit of that machine, in an examination of the
forces at play within that unit I can perhaps best
point out some of the most pressing of the prob-
lems that face us.
I I
Shrew Romps .

 

|in0T|1e Classroom 

It is true that before the educational process
can begin, there must be a determination on the
part of the student to make the best of what is
there for him. Beyond that, it is the duty of the
Iaculty to see that he has an adequate basis for
flhe “decisions and revisions” which will prepare
him to take hisplace as a useful and contented
member of society.

The teaching process is essentially an intimate
‘one. At the root of real learning has always been

A the personal contact, the leading of the student by

the teacher into thinking through reading and dis-
cussion. I have said that I do not believe there
can be any real learning until the student is con-
vinced, as opposed to being logically aware, that the
material in question is ‘of importance to him. Such
a conviction is basically a function of the personal
bond which must exist between teacher and student.
As the process proceeds from the intimate toward

the massive the essential rapport between student.‘

and teacher becomes increasingly unlikely.
Personal Bond

I seriously doubt that in a large number of
classroom situations such a personal bond can ex-
ist. It is obvious that extensive personal contact
is unlikely in a biology lecture section of one

hundred students. But the classroom problem only 5

begins with the unwieldy size of the class. The
lecturer who times his entrance with the bell,
finishes his last sentence exactly forty-nine minutes
forty-ﬁve seconds later in time for a dash to. the
door and retreat behind the mask of his‘ ofﬁce hours

is only one step, a narrow one, from the tape re--

corder, and the tape recorder is even closer to the” "

inert mass of the library. The only excuse for the
teacher is the very humanity which the library and
the tape recorder do not possess.

‘The most. important single chunk of education
that a teacher can pass on to the student is an
awarenesg of what it is about his ﬁeld that has led
the -lecturer to devote his life to it. It is precisely
this which is omitted in the factory system. The,
ability to infect the student with a love for the
subject not as a logician but as a man is the single
quality that distinguishes the competent teacher
from the great one.

of the Shrew” last weekend pro-
vided the theater faithful with
several enjoyable moments. The
production departed drastically
from authentic Shakespeare to
bring a most worthy interpreta-
tion of this comedy here.

Taking much in the way of
television and vaudeville, this
crowd—pleasing devices f r 0 in
show truly burlesqued the Bard
of Stratford-on-Avon". Although
painfully lacking in Elizabethan

rendition, the Players’ “Shrew”

was soothing as a rib—tickler.

Stephen Foster Memorial lent
itself to excellent staging, espec-
ially in concentrating all audi-
ence attention into a compact
area. Alternate use of the stage-
centered scene house, the special
forestage and the use of the
auditorium aisles by the actors
permitted swift movement of the
action. Transition between
scenes flowed smoothly, although
the changes of scenes were im-
mediately perceptible.

Props cmd Costumes

Dynamic usage of props and
costumes, such as the too—large
stack of books by Tranio, the
clattering pans in the starvation
scene and the gaudy creations of
the Haberdasher and Tailor,
added what stilted dialogue took
away.

,Preceding the moon-sun ex-
change in the Fourth Act, Petru-
chio, Katharina and Hortensio
travelled across the stage, went
down one set of stairs, crossed in
front of the forestage and
ascended again to the stage to
create the impression of travel
along the public road called for
by the script. This circuitous
lines backstage and in the wings,
robbing the audience of witty

route, however, left too many

speeches. _

Jack Joy, in his portrayal of
Petruchio, ﬁlled the role aptly.
His facial expressions, coupled
with mature vocal intonations
and boisterous spirit, filled the

   

time honoredtframe of the dia-
mond male person.

Scowling, smiling coyly and
mocking lines of others, Joy
pleasingly centered much atten-
tion on himself. Strong baritone
tones which sometimes matched,
more often opposed his mugging,
also added to his part.

The beastly characteristics of
Petruchio shone forth when he

met Kate. In actions deﬁnitely A

not gentlemanly he courted Kate
in a riotous, romping few min-
utes that had her over most of
the stage and nearly undressed
when the roughhouse got a little
too mean. .

Detracting from his part, Joy
seemed everly rough throughout,

and broke character too many’

.tinries when the farcial action
caused him to join the audience
in laughing. He had almost none
of the whimsicality demanded
of thelpart.

The fair-haired Kate, played
enjoyably for both herself and
the audience by Mary Johnson,
was the portrait of the real
shrew.'_She grew out of her fa-

other-dominated devilishness at

the capable hands of ‘Petruchio,
but failed to develop completely
into the good wife called for true
S h a k e spearean interpretation.
Miss J ohnson’s roughness match-
es that oflJoy, but with pleasant
use of her sharply barbed tongue
and genuine huffiness. ..

In her. one long speech in the
last act where she “cuts up” un-
womanly women, namely the re-

 x~&\

calcitant wives of Hortensio and
Lucentio, Miss Johnson lacked
depth and feeling necessary to
conclude her character change
from the shrew to the under-
standing wife.

Lucentio Speaks Well

As the suitor to Bianca, Lu-
centio (Nick Pran_is) spoke well
and brought his intent to cap-
ture this prime piece off well.
Nick truly was in a state of be-
ing ‘_‘head over Heels,” but when
not speaking fell into utter use-
lessness on stage.

Boasting, puffing Tranio (Don
Madzin) glittered in his pre-
tended part as the wealthy play-
boy. Larry Heller played the
numb, nearly demented Horten-

_sio. well, pleasing all and sur-

prising none when he failed to
win the hand of Bianca.

An excellent version of Bi-
anca, who hailed all her pur-
suers as necessary to her inflat-
ed man—conscious personality,
was given by Eleanor Chima.

Nick Bellich, as the selfish
Baptista, Terry Evans, as an
Arizona—type Grumio, Dale Hop-
per, playing the vigorous Bion-
della, and Ralph Bitterbart, as
Gremio, all backed the rapidly
progressing production with good
parts.

Setting the scene for the play-
within—a-play, Tom Jenkins fit-
ted into the Lord’s domineering
role capably, but proved over-
zealous in later scenes as the
Pedant.

THE DRESS PARADE

What will the American college student wear this
spring? Gather round, you rascals, and light a good
Philip Morris Cigarette, and puff that rich, natural to-
bacco, and possess your souls in sweet content, and listen.

As we know, college fashions have always been casual.

. This spring, however, they have become malcesliift.

The object is to look madly improvised, gaily spur-of-
the-moment! For example, girls, try a peasant skirt with
a dinner jacket. Or matador pants with a bridal veil. Or
Bermuda shorts with bronze breastplates. Be rakish!

Be impromptu! Be devil-take-the-hindmost!

And, men, you be the same. Try an opera cape with
sweat pants. Or a letter-sweater with kilts. Or a strait-
jacket with hip boots. Be bold! Be daring! Be a tourist
attraction!

spring. In fact, one of the highlights of the season turns '

time backward in its ﬂight. I refer to the comeback of
the powdered wig.

This charming accoutrement, too long neglected, has
already caught on with style-conscious students all over
the country. On hundreds of campuses rock-and—roll is
giving way to the minuet, and patriotic undergraduates
are dumping British tea into the nearest harbor. This, of
course, does not sit well with old King George. For that
matter, a lot of our own people are steamed up too, and
there has even been some talk of revolution. But I
hardly think it will come to that. I mean, how can we
break with the mother country when we are dependent
on her for so many things — linsey-woolsey, minie balls,
taper snuffers, and all like that? She, on the other hand,
relies on us for turkeys, Philip Morris, Cinemascope, and
other valuable exports. So I say, if Molly Pitcher and
those other Bryn Mawr hotheads will calm down, we may

, yet ﬁnd an amicable solution for our differences. But

let not our British cousins mistake this willingness to
negotiate for weakness. If ﬁght we must, then ﬁght we
will! Paul Revere is saddled up, the rude bridge arches
the ﬂood, and the ROTC is ready!

But I digress. We were smoking a Philip Morris
Cigarette——O, darlin’ cigarette! 0, happy smoke! O,
ﬁrm! 0, fresh! 0, fragrant! O, long-size! 0, regular!
0, get some! —-and talking of new spring fashions, let
us turn now to the season’s most striking new feature:
pneumatic underdrawers, These inﬂatable rubber gar-
ments make every chair an easy chair. Think how wel-
come theyiwill be when you sit through a long lecture!
They are not, however, without certain dangers. Last
week, for example, Rimbaud Sigafoos, a University of
Pittsburgh sophomore, fell out of an 18th story window
in the Tower of Learning. Thanks to his pneumatic
underdrawers, he suffered no injury when he struck the

_ sidewalk, but the poor fellow is still bouncing and it is

feared that he will starve to death.

Panthers Take

Thriller From

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

Dave Hirst, Jack Hammond,

gracefully to sweep the ﬁrst
three places on the ﬂying

deﬁcit and led, the Panther

gymnasts to a 52-44 win over

The match was extremely close
throughout as the running score
was tied three times, and the big-

spread, was a four-point Blue and
Gold advantage after the ﬁrst
event.

Pitt’s Dave Ruber provided
the highlight of the evening as
he scrambled up the 20-foot

Basketball Needs ~
Professional Rue I

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

A - - - - - - - V - - ¢ : 3 - : : '3

College basketball and football are invariably harassed
by a multitude of rules changes each year. At their annual
meetings the Rules Committee of these two sports relent-
lessly‘ search for means to improve the game. They want
college basketball and football to be acclaimed by the spec-
tators as the most colorful games to watch.

The practical way, they feel, is to alter the rules. Rules changes
is the most prominent method used. Scores of new rules are en-
acted and invalidated from season to season. They are usually put
into. effect for- only one season. If the new legislation proves satis-

_\, factory it is permitted to remain; if characterized as unsaitsfactory

it is repealed. .
These modiﬁcations are more controversial in basketball
than football. At ﬁrst we had the center jump after every basket.

The team with the height advantage was usually the superior

quintet. Then came the rule which stated that any fouls com-

mitted in the last three minutes of the game were to carry an A

automatic two-shot penalty. After trying them for several seasons

they were erased from the rule book. In the opinion of the

Rules Committee they did not accomplish their desired objec-
tives—improving the game.

Today we have the 12-foot foul lane designed to keep the big
man from loaﬁng under the hoop and dunking the ball every time
he gets his hands on it. This is supposed to be the equalizer for
the little performer. It is intended to keep the middle open for him

"to drive in for layup shots. Whc ‘
ther or not it has fulfilled its ob-
jective is problematical.

Another rule which we would
assent to giving a one-year trial
run is the 24-second law used by
the professional teams in the Na-
tional Basketball Association. The
major restriction should be that
it will be used only in the last
four minutes of a game to keep
the team leading by four or six
points from stalling. College bas-
ketball has been frowned upon as
being a foul-shooting contest in
many instances. It’s not uncom-
mon for the two teams to try 80,

   

charity circle. Yet when a team
has a slight lead with less than
four minutes to play the defen-
sive quintet has no choice but to
foul to get possession. They have
tohave the ball to score. They
must take the chance by fouling.
This makes for poorly played bas-
ketball and defeats the purpose
for which the rules are intended.

If college basketball would
alter the pro law to make the
offensive ﬁve shoot within 30
seconds after gaining possession
in the ﬁnal four minutes it
would minimize the stalling
most schools.
Repeated fouling would decline.
and the ball would change hands
a possible six to twelve times
more than it normally does.

It should not work to the dis-
advantage of any team whether
they have great height or just
average height. The game would
be faster and more exciting. They
have tried everything else; why
not consider this possibility?

point barrier as he accounted for
13 points to boost his career total
to 1009. He now joins teammate
Bob Lazor in this accomplishment.

Starting the second half, Coach
Ben Carnevale of Annapolis had
his Middies switch from a zone to
‘a man-to-man defense in an at-
tempt to stop the Panther scoring
attack.

The sharpshooting of Don
Hennon enabled the Oaklanders
to widen the gap in the score to
27 points midway" in the second
half as they held a 69-42 lead.

Hennon ﬁnished -as the game's
. high scorer with eleven ﬁeld goals
and two fouls for 24 points. Riser
followed with six ﬁeld goals and
ﬁve fouls for 17 points. Lazor also
broke into the double ﬁgures with
15 points on seven two-‘pointers
and one foul.
