vention.

Staisey. 49, is presently chair-
man of the Board of Commission-
ers and a former Councilman. As-
sistant District Attorney, and
State Senator.

The goal, of "The Builders,“
they have said,,is to improve the
quality of life by funding ‘social

services, which include the Al-
legheny County Community Col-'

lege, .drug abuse treatment pro-
gram, better low cost housing for
low and middle income families,
an economic and effective’ rapid
transit system for all the county,
improved care for the aged, chil-
dren, mentally ill and mentally
retarded, and environmental con-
trol.

has served as County Coroner and
is presently the minority Com-
missioner.

His running mate Robert F.
Stokes, 46, as a resident of Clair-

He has served as City Chairman
and ‘Mayor of Clairton, as well as

charges in DA battle .-

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD

The contest for the office of District Attorney is shaping up into a
mudslinging battle that knows few bounds.

Incumbent DA,Robert W. Duggan (R. l. seeking re-election for his
third term. has charged his opponent, Democratic State Legislator
Leonard L. Martino, with employing two men with police records to
"mastermind his campaign." '

Martino responded bycalling Duggan an "unmitigated liar" and
stated that if Duggan has "any knowledge“ of illegal activites in the
campaign he should act as the incumbent DA and not as a candidate in

political campaign.

Duggan refered to former Public Safety Director John'Bingler, Jr.

‘and two other unsuccessful Democratic Party candidates for the DA

nomination, all of whom have endorsed Martino, as “The Reject Club.”

Countering, Martino said, "I thinklthis is all a smoke screen of try-
ing to /run a campaign of innuendo and slurs to cover up his <Duggan's)

' inept and ineffective eight year administration." ‘

_ Speaking in behalfof .Martino
1‘ at a recent news conference.
?;'Bingler charged that a “code of
silence" in the County Detective
Bureau is obstructing a federal in-
vestigation of “racket payoffs to
Duggan employees." As told by
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
' Bingler said Duggan should have
fired the “silent” county detec-
tives who pleaded the fifth amend-
ment in regard to payoffs.

“Duggan’s office has lost its reputation for integrity,” said Bing-

ler. —
- Each candidate has accused the other of playing with "shady asso- ‘ '

The office being so earnestly sought after is the chief law officer
of the county. The DA appoints theassist‘antDAs and the county detec-
tives. He also presents all criminal cases for trial.‘ The‘term lasts for

Barbieri sat on the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia from
1964 to 1970,‘ and on the Commonwealth Court of_Pennsylvania from
1970 until his appointment to the Supreme Court. '

He received his B.A. degree from the University of Pennsyl-
Vania‘, and attended law school there.

Two other candidates also attended the University of Pennsyl-

cis C. Fratangelo (R.), JoAnn
Evans Gardner (R.), Louis Ma-
son, Jr. (D.), Paul A. Palombo
(R.), and Eugene P. DePasquale
(D.). - '
The experience of the group
runs from the seven—years in
City Council of Kamyk to those
with no experience.
has had 14 years of service with
the city. -Clark ran for Mayor of
Pittsburgh against Joseph Barr
10 years ago as an independ-
ent. Fratangelo is relying on his

‘life-longyresidency in Pittsburgh

as his major qualifications in
terms of experience. '
Jo Ann Evans Gardner, the
only woman candidate for a four-
year term, is also a nationally
known speaker on Feminism.

Mason is presently the Presi-
dent of City. Council. He is the
first black to hold this position.

Palombo has no previous ex-
perience in, city "government
while DePasquale lists his occu-
pation as a street foreman as
instrumental as his knowledge
of “the true feelings of our city's
people."

The most important issue in
the 1971 campaign vary with
the interpretations of each candi-
date. Caliguiri, an incumbent,
views the unrestricted exercis-
ing of citizens votes as the most
important issue.

Clark sees the economic status
of Pittsburgh as crucial. He

Caliguiri -

stresses “maintaining progress
while working in an atmosphere
of austerity.”

The use of drugs and crime in
Pittsburgh is viewed by Frat-
angelo to be an issue of para-
mount importance.

Gardner is protesting discrim-
ination in the form of the “Un-
representative membership of
City Council."

Providing services to the ‘city,

of Pittsburgh is Kamyk’s idea
of the most important campaign
issue. DePasquale, on the other
hand, sees the safety and well
.being of the police force and
firemen as important» due to
their understaffed condition.

The most important task fac--I
ing the City Council in the next
four years is also viewed differ-
ently by each -candidate. Cali-
guiri plans a main thrust at the
individual neighborhood, its
renewal and upkeep. ’

Clark lists the need for an incul-
cation of pride in the city along
with increased construction to en-
tice people to remain in the urban

- areas. The transportation dilemma

and the condition of the police
and fire departments are also
seen by Clark to be major issues
in the next four years.

Fratangelo lists juvenile crimes, _
pollution, improvement of city
streets, and rapport between city
officials as crucial during the
up-coming term.

However. most students questioned were un-
concerned. One person said that he's not regis-

A student registered in a Philadelphia sub-
urb answered. "I—know nothing about the candi-

not going to vote."

And a girl from Detroit admitted. "I know
nothing about Detroit or Pittsburgh. and I wont
be'voting. I probably know more about the Pitt
elections." ‘

One dormitory student who hasntregistered
explained that she “was confused whether dorm
students were allowed."

A commuting student who will be voting offer-
ed an explanation for the mass apathy. “The is-

tained.“The only way you can beat the system
is the system’s way.” ‘ ’ '

said she isn‘t happy with the choices. -"I want

Claims overestimated budget.

Two in Controller race

by SUE MCDEVITT

Rolf Larsen and Robert Friend
are vying for the office of
County Controller.

The County‘ Controller has
general supervision over the-
financial affairs of all County
departments. bureaus, and divi-

cies that rely solely or in part

support. He also audits the ‘daily
and annual financial reports
of the County and the Insti-
tutional District. for inspec-
tion by the Court of Common

Pleas.

Robert Friend, 40, is the in-
cumbent. Controller for four
years, he has begun the job of
putting the manual operations
of bookkeeping on computers. ’

He has criticized the County
Commissioners fiscal practices.

According to Bob Friend, the

by LOIS LEYINSON

Although technically illegal
in Pennsylvania, abortions and
abortion advice can be obtain-
ed'in Pittsburgh. ,

That fact was revealed by
panelists discussing abortion and
contraception here Tuesday.

Anna Goldstein, advisor to
the local chapter of Zero Popu-
lation Growth. said that women
can to to the Free Clinic in
East Liberty for abortion advice.

She said that besides the ini-
‘tial examination to determine

pregnancy. the Clinic offers
counseling services’ and finan-
cial aid. If an abortion is de-
cided upon. the woman is usual-
ly sent to New York City or
Washington. D.C; where it is
legal to perform them.

The types of abortions obtain-
able at West Penn Hospital were
outlined by Dr. Douglas‘Thomp-

. son, an“oby-gynie"specialist; they

include: a dilution done with
suction up to 12 weeks after
conception; injection of a saline-
solution that terminates the

growth of the fetus and induces
labor, a hystronomy (Caesreian
section), and a hysterectomy re-

Donolow blinks Voting rights, resident tiiitsion

' “‘ by SUE HOENSTINE

Could a responsible official

S ‘let 10 million dollars slip through

"in

the fingers of an already‘banl<-
rupt state‘?

A few weeks ago. Chairman
of the State Appropriations Com-
mittee. Senator Benjamin Dono-
low posed a similar question.

"With the Attorney General's
ruling that students could vote
their college communities.
and since the right to vote is the

highest.privilege of Citizenship‘
in- .

he (Donolow) wondered if
state tuition rateswould have to

_' ‘follow for out-of-state students."

.p'ropriations’ Committee

Paul ~.i\/Iuench, -Executive Direc-
tor ‘of the Senate Majority Ap-
. ex-

plained.

Muench,*one of Donolow’s aides,
also said that “if out of state stu-
dents took these cases to court
and won; it would cost the state
and the taxpayers about $10 mil-
lion.” ‘ -

Maintaining that continued

. residency must be the basis for‘

determining‘ tuition ‘rates, Fred
Sehring of Pitts State Residency
Office said that granting in"-state

"tuition rates to voting non.-resi-

dents sould involve rewriting the
residency requirement. '" _

He noted that -the residency
policy was released from the
Auditor Generals Office in 1966
and is the same for»Pitt. Penn
State. and Temple University.

The various living creatures
were sacrificed in order to re-

this must be done as the souls of

an important feature at parties.
The traditional jack—o-lantern also
originated with these colonists.

The vandalism and pranks as-
sociated with Halloween are of-
ten attributed to the huge lrish
immigration to the LXS. after the
1840 potato famine.

Since Irish folklore kept alive
the belief of “little people” that
constantly watch the homes of
mortals, any mischief that would
occur would be blamed on them.

The pranks also became a tra-
dition as practical jokes were one
of the major sources of enter-
tainment. and Halloween provided
an opportunity for many pranks to
take place with the explanation.
"the goblins must have done it."

The "trick or treating" that
takes place probably stems from
the harvest festival celebration
to appease "Muck Olla"a perver-
sion of the name of a "Druid God.
The exact origin is unknown.

HOMECOMING '71: Students voting to: the Pitt Woman.

°Ye olde’ honiecomings reoallcil

Remember the good old days‘?
"Freshmen will sit together in
the middle of the auditorium and
grouped around the freshmen will
be the Pitt Rifles. Dents. and
frats. All those not included in
these classifications will find
room somewhere in the hall."

Or so stated the 1935 ground

rules concerning a homecoming.

pep assembly.

If you think that was fun. you
should have been here for the
alumni's return back in 1932. for

a dance featuring "broadcasts-of.

songs and cheers“ of the two par-
ticipating schools. Twenty-three
skidoo! «

In the past, homecoming events.

events at Pitt were largely under
the domain of a- Homecoming
Committee of the Alumni Asso-

ciation. Until mid-century, ‘the

only regularly scheduled activ-
ities unique to the ‘Homecoming

,weekend were alumni smokers

held on Fridayevenings. It was

-’ student initiative that developed

the traditionof fraternity open
houses to distinguish the week-
end. ~

To be sure. there were pep ra'l-

lies and parades—but they were"

too frequent during the terms
course to be considered anadded
attraction for the student. Some-
times a special dance open to un-

dergraduates ‘marked the occa; _
sion. but its-scheduling was an'ad- ’ .
ministrative 'decision. and most" 1

often it wasnot planned’.

Not until 1955 was Andrew
Schurman. alumni chairman. able
to state that "for the first time
the Homecoming program -of
events has included participation
by both graduates and students."

Over the years, the administra-

tion had become increasingly sen '-

sitive to student needs. As stu-
dent leaders played a greater role
in planning the celebration, they
were able to develop a diversity
of activities appealing to a vari-
ety of interests. No other area of
University life possessed such a
potentially broad base of student
concern and support. '

years. in which he abandoned im-
pressionistic methods for more

- traditional ones.

What surprises one most about
this work is its very -“__Ravelish”

sound, certainly reminiscent of._

much of‘ Ravel’s- music inspired

by Spanish subjects. The broad
sound draws upon not only the

tumult of battle but the sonority

of those great bells found in‘ so-

many of the French cathedrals as
well.

The rendition of this work- was

' a bit sloppy in places and espe-

cially noticed was the fact that
the two performers were not al-
ways observing the same tempo. ‘

More academic and much more
polished was the Stravinsky two-
piano concerto which followed.

. Here we were-presented with a
high caloric helping of vintage

Stravinsky from his neo-classical
period of the thirties. 

Full of diversity, this composi- -

tion certainly tests the agility of
even the most talented perform-
er. The ‘two pianists played in con-
stant contrapuntal competition
throughout with no decisive vic-
tory for either at the end. It was,

- however, a victory for ‘the excep-

tional technique of the artists—in-
volved. ~. -

Another "earful" awaited us as ‘

the concert concluded with the
Bartok'Sonata‘ for two pianos and

ists were joined in_”this wildy

from the glissandos of the tym-

ceived such inspiration.

by MARTY HELLMAN

Associate Sports Editor

An estimated Homecoming crowd of 25,000 will be on hand to-
morrow afternoon at the Stadium as the Pitt Panthers try to get
back on the winning track against the Syracuse Orangemen. Starting

with SU, the next five opponents have already compiled a composite‘

23-7-1 record and Cat victories may be hard to come by.

Although the Cats sport but a 2-4 mark going into the game.
the teams morale and spirit is undampened. Members of last

years team remember the 46-19
thrashing that the Orange hand-
ed the Cats and now hope to re-
verse the situation.

Syracuse Coach Ben Schwartz-
walder, in his 23rd year as
top man for the Orange admits

that his squad is relying a bit,
more 0n_a passing game this"

year.

Pitt’s defensive backfield
coach, Ralph Jelic realizes that
this Syracuse team puts the ball

. into the air more.“In’ the past

three weeks, they have passed
on a number of downs that you
wouldn’t necessarily expect
them to,” he saidf

The bulk of the Orange "of-
fense will be a running attack
though. Last week. against
Holy.- Cross. Schwartzwalder
started two sophomore half-
backs. and both proved to be
breakaway threats.

by MARK SIGMON

A couple weeks ago. Pitt football coach Carl
' DePasqua remarked. "Although Les may- not be
listed as a starter on the depth chart. he definitely

is a first-string football player."

Les Block is the Panthers‘ number two ‘tight
end. behind.Joel Klimek. A six-foot one inch.
218-pound sophomore. Block is Pitt‘s second-lea_d-
ing scorer with 18 points. via three TD aerials.

Concerning his amount of game time Block

B l0ck( ing}

Sophomore Ron Page, who
scored the -first two times he

carried, gained 70 yards in only '

five attempts and earned a berth
in the starting backfield. The

other newcomer, soph _ Bob
Barlette, is the other speed"-
ster. -

Several Orangemen are doubt-
ful starters for the game. Full-
back Marty Januszkiewicz heads
the injured list. He did, not
dress for the Holy Cross game
and Schwartzwalder says, ‘‘I’m
not sure whether his injured
shoulder will come around or
not.” - 4

The man to watch for on the
SU defense is Tom Myers, safe-

tyman. He intercepted two pass—_

es last week to increase his
career total to 16.“Syracuse Pub-
licist Larry Kimball emphasiz-
ed that Myers is the only one
not injured of five gridders de-
pended on before
started.

The only Panther who will be.

out of the starting lineup tomor-
row will be sophomore defensive

tackle John Robb. He sprained A

an ankle earlier in the week
while running at the Stadium.

Howard Broadhead, who miss-
ed a few practices this week
due to a virus, will probably
split Robb’s. duties with «sopho-
more Art Simon.

John Moss. senior halfback,
will return to the field after
missing the last two away games.

ofthe sophomores in the Power-

ing time will depend on their
performance tomorrow.

If the Panthers are not able
to overcome previous mistakes.
a Syracuse win will mean the
170th under Schwartzwalder.

A solid performance by the
Panther offense and a tight de-
fensive effort by the Cats may
mean a postponement for
Schwartzwalders milestone. For
the juniors and seniors from last
year. nothing could be better.

' with Bob Medwid at the helm. Slated to line-up behind himwillt

said. "I have learned a lot playing behind Klimek.
but I would rather be first-string. Now that we
are _using the Power-I formation. I've been getting
more playing time, because both Joel and I are
used at the same time due to our blocking ability."

Having performed at the tight end position
for the past four years, Les relishes the spot.

“I enjoy blocking on running plays. It's a
challenge between the linebacker and me. He is
out to get me. but I‘m determined to give him a

‘hard time."

Of Blocks three six-point receptions. one was
the winning catch against Navy with twenty-
seven seconds left on the clock. Regarding the
dual role of the tight end, Les admitted, "Very

few people notice the blocks you've made on’

the running plays. It‘s only when I catch a pass
thateverybody gets excited."

Not particularly prejudiced over the passing
abilities of any one Panther signalcaller, Block,
nevertheless, leans toward Dave Havern.

“Dave and I have got it together right now.
We often talk things over in practice. such as
patterns, fakes, or anything else that seems to be

giving me problems. He knows exactly where I _

will be on each play. It‘s _sort of like instinct
after going over the same pattern time after time.
I know he‘ll get the ball to me. "

Block (86) awaits tomorrow's game against the
Orangemen.

"I‘d love to play-pro ball. but becoming a
lawyer is my first goal. I am hoping that a few
seasons in the pros might help me set up a strong
financial base so.I could then go onto law
school."

During his senior year at Hubbard High
(Ohio); Block received numerous scholarship
offers from the Mid-American conference, in-
cluding such teams as Toledo, Ohio University,
Bowling Green, and Kent State. He chose Pitt
because he “wanted to see just how good I really
am.”

But with the score 3-0 it
looked as if the Charlie Brown

Art Park who looks vaguely
like the team’s namesake, was
putting the Economists down
one-two-three the fifth inning.

Jeff Adams and Lee Hoke
sandwiched singles around Tom
Stockhousen‘s pop-up followed
by Tom Kickham’s walk to load
up the bases. '

Then, Phil Wiest flied to short

be an easy out but for the

recovered the ball andvfired it
to second base, nailing the dar-

“Everyone can catch-, but I

Edinboro

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

This weekend Pitt fans will be
celebrating Homecoming. but
George Shimpeno. Edinboros soc-
cer coach, will be celebrating a
homecoming of his own when he
faces the Pitt booters tomorrow
at 9:30 a.m. at Pitt Stadium.‘

Shimpeno is a graduate of the
University of Pittsburgh and also
was a member of the varsity soc-
cer team from September. 1961.

through April. 1965, under the di-

rection of Pitt‘s present coach,
Leo Bemis.

"It should be an interesting
match—’going back and trying to
make an impressive show in your
own backyard." commented Shim-
peno. "It‘ll be nice to go home
again."

The Edinboro coach ‘will be]

bringing a very young and com-
paratively inexperienced squad to
combat Bemis’ soccermen tomor-
row. There is only one senior
booter on the team; the bulk of
the team consists of freshmen
and sophomore players.

Although this is only the third
year for intercollegiate soccer at
Edinboro, Shimpeno feels that the
inexperience of his team is not as
crucial a'problem as it has been
in the past.

“Before it was difficult to get
players who knew anything about
soccer," said Shimpeno, "but now
we’re getting more players who
have played soccer before and we
can field a better team."

Defensive standouts for the
Edinboro squad are: backs Mario

'D’Andrea and Joe Podufal, two-

year letterman and one-year let-
terman, respectively.

According to Shimpeno, goal
keeper Mike Radakovich “has
done his job very, very well“ con-
sidering that he is only a fresh-
man and is in his first season a
a soccer player. ‘

”Linesmen Mike Zafirovski and-

Jim Kirk have provided outstand-
ing performances for Edinboro on
offense. Zafirovski leads the team
in scoring with 12 goals in nine
