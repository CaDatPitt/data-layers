Pittsburgh Mayor Tom
Murphy discussed political
power with a group of Pitt
University Democrats last night,
explained why students should
support the city they live in and
tied both into his support of the
half—cent stadium tax that voters
may pass on Nov. 5. KW

He set the tone for the
evening right away by sitting
down on a table ‘at the front of
the classroom and asking the
audience, "What's your take on
politics?" ‘

The group was quiet for a
moment, then slowly broke out
into laughter at the uncomfort-

the question himself. ,

"Politics is about power:
who has it and who doesn't,"
Murphy said, talking in equal
parts with his voice and hands.

He told the group of more
than 40’ college students that the
power struggle in politics is
most often centered on how to
spend money and who has the
power to do so.

"If you're thinking about
going into politics,'' he said, "ask
yourself what you want to do
once you get power."

His speech from that point
took a turn toward cities and
taxes —— who has the power to

use tax money and how does it

better the city. Murphy said a

He emphasized the role gov-

what young people interested in

order to make their area a suc-

"Look at the changes in

said. "A city will succeed based

Maintenance workers
reiect Pitt's contract offer

Brett Taylor

News Assistant

The union representing Pitt
custodians has once again rejected
a contract offered by the
University, saying that the lan-
guage of the contract provided "too
many loop holes that did not guar-
antee benefits and wages to the
workers.

According to Nelson Bryant,
the business manager for Local 29
of the Service Employees
International Union, the language
stating the parameters of the con-
tract was slanted too much in favor
of the University.

For two years, Pitt's janitors,
groundskeepers and maintenance
workers have been working with-
out a contract. The two sides were
thought to be close to a contract
agreement earlier this fall, but
things fell apart. The workers want
a 3—percent wage increase retroac-
tive to January of 1996 and full-
coverage benefits.

Billy Jordan, president of the
Local 29, said in a telephone inter-

view that the revised contract
should be sent out by Friday.

He went on to say that the
workers need a week to look it
over and make decisions for them-
selves.

"We left the table with a tenta-
tive agreement," Jordan said. "It's
up to [the workers] to decide on
it."

Jordan said that the proposed
contract is the best the union will
accept without going on strike.

The question of a strike also
arose at the meeting. Several union
members vehemently argued the
idea with~Ernie Orsatti, the union's
attorney.

The workers all wished to
remain nameless because they
feared repercussions from their
supervisors in the form of less-
desirable tasks. They were frustrat-
ed because they felt they were not
receiving a good benefits package
from Pitt, and they argued that the
union is just settling for what it
can get.

According to several workers,

An anonymous caller probably didn’t
suspect her roommate was in the audience
during a staging of MTV’s Loveline last
night in the William Pitt Union when she
started complaining about the roornrnate’s
“unclean” sexual habits.

No one expected the roommate to
stand up in the middle of the packed
Assembly Room and start a counter-

attack over the caller’s sexual activities.

It was all part of the popular romance
and sex advice call-in show that airs late at
night on MTV. The show’s hosts, Dr.
Drew and Adam, answer any and all
romantic and sexual questions the audi-
ence may have in an educational but unin-

Janetto Ware serves up chicken at Spitfires, where Burger

   

ing stood last year.

Food services’ midterm: most
are happy with changes so far

Nora O'Neil

For The Pitt News

As the University switched food-
service providers this summer from
Marriott to Sodexho, both students and
food-service employees had high
expectations for the new provider. Now,
halfway through the semester, many of
these individuals commented on how
they felt Sodexho has been measuring
up.

John Bendick, a sophomore, was
disappointed that one of his old
favorites had been discontinued by
Sodexho.

"I really miss the sizzling steak sal-
ads that Marriott used to have on
Wednesdays," he said, "and the Burger
King was a big loss for a lot of my
friends."

Katie Sobash, a sophomore, was
also upset by some of the changes.

"I really liked the chicken nuggets
Schenley used to have, and the sherbert
they had at Baskin—Robbins is a lot bet-
ter than Columbo [the new frozen-
yogurt stand in Eddie's]," she said.

Vegetarian sophomore Christen
Lowery, however, was one of a few stu-
dents who was concemed about the
healthfulness of the food.

"I had hoped that the new provider
would offer more healthy food items,
but I'm still seeing a very small variety
of fat—free and low-fat foods," she said.
"1 would like to see more fresh fruit and
vegetables along with some heartier
healthy dishes. Why not make some
casseroles or vegetarian. lasagnas with
low—fat ingredients?"

Alison Shufran, a sophomore, was
also concerned about nutrition.

‘'1 wish that they would post the
dietary information. I'd like to know the
nutritional value of what I'm eating,"

she said.

Service was another issue Shufran
was concerned about.

"I still find Schenley to be under-
staffed during the busiest times of the
day. When I have 30 minutes for lunch
and there is only one cashier for the
huge line, I get pretty irritated," she
said.

Fernando Aguel, a sophomore, also
had comments about the dining facili-
ties‘ service.

"I do find the workers more friend-
ly this year, but I feel that the dining
halls sacrifice quality for quantity," he
said. "1 feel that my food is prepared
without care."

Alternatively, several students and
employees were pleased with the new
service.

Sophomore Tony Corso, for exam-
ple, was quite satisfied. _

"1 think that it's better than last year.
The pizza and pasta sauces in Eddie's
are better, and the shrimp and buffalo
wings in Sutherland‘s cafeteria are
great," he said. "I miss the Burger King,
but I think that Spitfire. place is pretty
good?

Kristy Swanger, a junior, was also
pleased with the changes Sodexho has
brought to Pitt.

"I'm really glad about the new facil-
ities in the Cathedral, and the addition
of the yogurt shop in Eddie's, and the
Nantucket Nectars juice selection in
Schenley are great," she said.

Abdou Cole, the food-service
director at Schenley Cafe and a 12-year
veteran of the University food service,
believes that Sodexho has been doing
well in improving the food service in
the short time it's been at Pitt.

"Just the other day, our Pizza Hut
was inspected, and it scored the highest

they strongly considered striking the Jordan said the University

day before the Miami football game,
Homecoming weekend. Instead of
striking, the union opted to demon-

strate during the game.

The workers said they do not
feel they have the internal support
to strike. They also questioned
whether there was a big enough
upcoming event to strike before.
They said they need to strike at a

time that would hit the University
hardest and make their services be

truly missed. ,

According to Jordan, Pitt did not
react too kindly to the demonstra-
tion during the Homecoming game.
Asa result, it is charging the union
with unfair labor practices.

   

 

thought the union did not have the
right to demonstrate because it was
in the negotiation process. .

"We demonstrated in efforts to
put pressure on the University,"
Jordan said. "We were just trying to
level the playing field for our work-
ers." , .

He said he doesn't feel the union
did anything wrong.

According to Jordan, the major
details of the proposed contract
include the following:

- The contract was extended
from its original length to 1999.

0 A 3—percent wage increase
retroactive to January of 1997 and

,an additional 2 percent each year

until 1999. ‘

0 The benefits
package will be paid in
full by the University —
for the first year. After
the first year, the
workers will pay 15
percent of the yearly
increase, and the rest
will be paid by Pitt.

Jordan said there is
one major point that
the union has to com-
promise in the contract
as it now stands: when
a worker returns after
receiving workman's compensation,
he regains the same wages and ben-
efits, but the University has no
obligation to give that person the

Loveline and the concert."

Murphy was referring to the hun-
dreds of students attending a popular
MTV romance and sex call-in program
that was staged at the same time in the
William Pitt Union.

Murphy also hit on the issue of
raising taxes to supplement changes
within the city by explaining the para-

FROM PAGE 1-

dox of everyone wanting changes when .

no one is willing to pay higher taxes.
"There are no free lunches," he
said. "These successes in the past were

because of people who wanted a_

change for the better, and they saw
beyond the immediate tax."

"Leaders 25 years ago made an
investment in a new airport," Murphy
continued. "Many people weren't
happy about it then  [but] where
would we be without it today?"

From there, he proposed that voters
support the additional half—cent sales
tax for a new baseball stadium. He
explained that citizens need to give
money now so that Pittsburgh can
become a more prosperous city.

"I believe this decision is about us,
not ball teams," he said. "We have the
ability to invest in the area's future,,and
this is the way to invest."

The mayor's 30-minute discussion
was followed up by a brief question-
and—answer period with the audience,
during which he fielded concerns about
investments in Oakland, the sales of
state liquor stores and a professional
soccer team coming to Pittsburgh.

The 40—person meeting in a
Cathedral of Learning classroom was
the first time Murphy spoke to the orga-
nization since last October, and the U-
Dems president, Paul McKrell, was
pleased he did so but was hoping for a
larger turnout.

"We have a strong membership,"
he said, "but with Loveline and the
Environmental Coalition's concert on
the union lawn, we don't have everyone
here."

Memorial   to military women will be unveiled this weekend

Across the Nation

ARLINGTON, Va. —-- Final prepara-
tions are underway for this weekend's
dedication of a memorial to honor
women in the military. Officials provided
a preview yesterday.

It's actually part memorial, part
museum, and part restoration of the orig-
inal grand entrance to the Arlington
National Cemetery outside Washington.
The main structure is the original, curved
gateway that is 30 feet high and faced
with granite, and it is broken by stair-
ways. Designers say it's meant to sym-
bolize the barriers faced and broken
down by women in the military.

The memorial also includes exhibits,

Manchu Wok, too. The food is better
prepared, and we are now offering veg-
etarian plates."

Rodney Coe, a Schenley employee,
also felt that Sodexho was a good ﬁt for
the University.

"The food is better," said Coe.
"There are a lot more students to serve
this year, and Sodexho is handling it
well."

Betsy Sallade—Farina, the director
of food services for the University, had
several comments on students’ concern
over the dropping of several Marriott
offerings.

"Sodexho is new, and we want
them to try out their own concepts, but
we don't want to throw out everything
that Marriott did well," she said. "In
fact, we are thinking about bringing
back the hot—salad option in Eddie's."

Sallade—Farina also discussed the
healthfulness of the food.

"We've really tried to improve the
nutrition of the food. We've brought in
several regional chefs to design a more
extensive vegetarian menu," she said.
"We also encourage the students to give
us recipes that they enjoy, especially
vegetarian recipes, and we'll try to
duplicate them in the dining halls."

On the issue of customer service,
Schenley Cafe Director Cole said
things are improving.

"Customer service is a work in
progress. We're trying to become more
people—oriented than before," he said.
"We've initiated the Total Customer
Care program for our employees. We
have weekly meetings, and we've been
inviting students to these meetings and
others to get their opinions on what
we're doing."

Sallade—Farina echoed Cole's com-
ments about customer service. She
said, "The students are the reason we
are here, and we want to make sure
they get what they want."

self as Amy, voiced her frustration with
the sexual behavior of her roommate and
her boyfriend.

“He’s there a lot, and they leave the
shower a disgusting mess after they —-— do
it,” she said. In the midst of this, an audi-
ence member burst out laughing when she
realized the caller was talking about her.

The giveaway was the boyfriend’s
name: “Poopie.”

The petite, c1ean—cut and totally
unabashed roormnate-in—question quickly
got up on stage and said calmly but firm-
ly, “Do you want me to talk about your
problems?”

With encouragement from the hosts
and audience, she told the room about the
caller’s summer job as an exotic dancer
who also performed oral sex and “manu-
al stimulation” for money.

The crossﬁre was surprising good-
natured and kept the entire audience
shocked and laughing. All the while, Dr.
Drew, the dapper, reserved host, warned
the caller about her destructive actions
and suggested the roommate on stage be
more considerate.

Adam, the show’s comic relief,
smirked and explained that since the audi-
ence member had a boyfriend named
“Poopie” they were bound to have trou-
bles.

As this proved, there was no room for
embarrassment on Loveline.

Before the show began, Ethel Uy,
lecture director of Pitt Program Council,
the organization responsible for arranging
the event, summed up the theme of the
night. “We are encouraging questions.
Please do not be afraid to ask.”

The event was not recorded for
broadcast because the only televised ver-
sions are on location at MTV.

The program started on radio in Los
Angeles about 15 years ago and only
recently appeared in television format. Dr.
Drew, who is a practicing physician, host-
ed the program alone. Adam, his wise-
cracking partner, didn’t begin until MTV
picked up the show.

“I actually started out only listening
to the show while pursuing my lucrative
carpet cleaning career,” joked Adam.

Students were initially extremely
hesitant to get down to the intimate
inquiries, but after only 10 minutes, ques-
tions of all origins ﬂew across the room as
two PPC members, armed with micro—
phones, tried to accommodate all curious
attendants.

Later the hosts discussed the show’s
“Joke Total,” a tally of the number of
jokes the often—serious Dr. Drew has
made on Loveline.

“If I am funny, it is completely unin-
tentional,” he said, though he often had to
restrain himself from laughing at such
perplexing sexual troubles such as the Pitt
student who complained that he faints
every time he has sex.

Adam added, ‘‘I find his occasional
jokes fascinating.” The total is supposed-
ly up to about 19 or 20.

  Pitt owes a good
contract to custodians

It may be time to strike.

Pitt custodians have put up with the University’s
procrastination for long enough.

A few weeks ago, The Pitt News suggested that the
University should give custodians the same offer it gave
everybody else: a 2-percent raise and a 1-percent bonus
for outstanding employees.

In the meantime, it turned out that not everybody
received the same offer. Chancellor Nordenberg and his
cronies received raises and bonuses of even greater
rates. -

Nordenberg’s raise was more than 3.2 percent, and
his bonus works out to over 13 percent!

That is a slap in the face to every custodial worker
who has been dragged along without an acceptable con-
tract for almost two years now.

-If the contract offer currently being written up and
due out Friday isn’t exactly what you have been asking
for —— strike.

It’s time. It’s time to tell the administrators that you
work just as hard as they do. You may only work ‘in the
hallways outside their plush ofﬁces, but that doesn’t
mean what you do is any less important than what they
do.

At the end of next week, when every worker has
had a chance to read the contract, strike.

Strike.

You should have your jobs back by the middle of
November. That’s when 40,000 fans will trash Pitt
Stadium during the game against Syracuse. If Pitt ofﬁ-
cials "feel they can live with that mess outdoors, in the
stadium, then let them deal with the mess made by over
6,000 fans in the Fitzgerald Field House two days later
for the basketball game against Bucknell.

And if the administrators don’t offer you the con-

tract you deserve, tell them they can clean it themselves.

Think hard before naming your child

but think about how your child is
going to feel. Do you want a dozen
heads to turn every time you shout
your child’s name?. It just leads to
confusion.

And a strong possibility exists
that, rather than going through the
hassle of sorting out which Mike or
whoever tl1ey’re looking for, other
children will simply give little Mike
a new nickname, and a nickname
bestowed by other children is not
likely to be a kind one. It will, how-
ever, last forever. The ﬁnal result of
naming your child a nice, safe, very
often-used name is that, at his wed-
ding, the minister may ask, “Do
you, Pork Belly, take this woman to
be your lawfully wedded wife?”

Another problem category is
names which are pronounced nor-
mally but spelled in an abnormal
way. For instance, why would any-
one name their child Jennifer and
spell it “Genyphyr?” This is not
originality. You are not fooling any-
one. We all know that you simply
named your child Jennifer. No one
will approve of your change to the

name. Peopleiwill have problems-

with it, assuming that since it is
spelled differently, it must be pro-
nounced differently. When they ﬁnd
out that it is pronounced the usual
way, they may question your litera-
cy level. ‘

If there is a generally accepted
way of spelling your child’s name,
use it. Changing letters for no
apparent reason just so it will look
different can only make you look
stupid, uneducated and illiterate.
Having a weird spelling does not
make it a diﬁerent name. You are
still being unoriginal, which is fairly
acceptable when naming your chil-
dren, but you are also being armoy-
ing in your ﬂawed, failed attempt to
be original, which is not acceptable.

The third category is really
weird names. If you have a strange
name, do not pass it on to your chil-
dren. It might seem as though you
can ﬁnally make yourself feel better
about what your parents did to you,
but this is absolutely unfair to your
children. They will grow up hating
you. Some redeeming quality about
the name should actually exist if
you plan to pass it along. Just the
fact that you yourself have it is not
sufﬁcient. For instance, if your par-

ents narned you “Moonﬂower” or’

something like that, you would be
well-advised to keep it to yourself.
Do not perpetuate the outrage.

And please, please, please,
make some sort of effort to give
your child a name that people can
pronounce (category four: unpro-
nounceable names). Even if the way
that you pronounce your name is
very pretty, that serves very little
purpose if no one else ever manages
to say it that way. If no one can pro-
nounce it, you are dooming some-
one to going through a life ﬁlled

with, “Uh...Ms., uh, Ms. 
hey, you!” '

I had a friend whose name was
difficult to say, and whenever we
had a substitute teacher in school,
he’d be reading down the list of
names, get to hers, pause for a while
as he tried to decide the appropriate
method of butchering her name,
take a deep breath, gird his loins,
and try. Not one ever succeeded,
and it added a good ﬁve minutes to
the whole ro1l—taking process.

Eventually she did get used to
it. I think one of the funniest
moments in high school was when
we had a sub, and when he got to
her name, he didn’t even try. He just
said, “Uh—oh,” and she said, “I’m
here.” But unless you are okay with
no one ever calling your child by
name, make sure that the name is
pronounceable. ,

Finally, no matter what your
last name is, it does not give you the
right to make cute little jokes with
your children’s names. I went to
school once with a girl whose last
name was Pepper. Her parents

’ named her Salt Ann. This is sheer

cruelty. You might think it’s
absolutely adorable, and I suppose
you can go ahead and do it, but
when your child eventually comes
after you with a butcher knife, don’t
say I didn’t warn you. Giving your

' child a name like “John Johnson” or

naming your twin son and daughter
Jack and Jill also falls into this cate-
g0TY- .

Children do not love parents
who give them names like this, so
just remember these points, and you
should be okay.

Jessica Birch is really happy that
her parents did nottname her Bier
instead. ‘

POINT/COUNTERPOINT
It’s not ourplace to

Physician-assisted
suicide is gross misuse
of medical knowledge

Jennifer Stoltz
columnlst

Doctors should not “play God”
with assisted suicide. It’s that sim-
ple. ‘

While death is a fact of life, we
as humans are clouded by fear of the
imminent. We all have our own con-
jectures as to what happens to us
after we die, but really, no one
knows for sure. Even the Supreme
Court cannot deal with that issue,
but over the summer, it had its say
on a very closely related one.

Physician-assisted suicide has
devolved from a controversy to all-
out chaos, splitting the country. The
highest judicial body in America
proclaims its disapproval of this
practice. I agree with the court
wholeheartedly.

Doctors such as Jack Kevorkian
should not even call themselves doc-
tors.‘Death occurs when it is meant
to, not when we decide it should.
Physicians are not meant to take
control of human life like one con-
trols a puppet. Doctors can help,
heal and love, but the practice of
assisted suicide is a blatant misuse
of their knowledge. Doctors exist to
treat and alleviate
suffering. There
must be a line
drawn somewhere,
and this is it.

Many people
who are in favor of
assisted suicide
focus only on the
alleviation of suf-
fering. The stages
at the end of life
can be far from,
pleasant, but we
must be concerned with easing the
process, not forcing it.

Doctors should try to honor their
patients’ wishes for treatment or
lack thereof. This includes any
advance directives and “Do Not
Resuscitate” orders. All reasonable
efforts must be made to lessen pain,
according to what the patient wants.
Medications and treatments exist
solely for this purpose. In fact, there
are entire clinics and-departments
dedicated to this field of medicine.

But there are limitations in every
field —— points beyond what is ethi-

‘¥p34’m*v‘»V:*~xa3c'»jw‘\‘«5 i.s.x.;.a.r.J.a.J»'.é-*-

cal and what is not. Physician-assist-
ed suicideis well beyond that limit,
beyond health care’s realm.
Artificial life support should be
terminated. if the patient/family
wishes to do so. That is within the
health care realm. Advance direc-
tives and living wills should be hon-
ored. That is within the boundaries.
Deliberately forcing death is not.
Doctors are human, and while
physician-assisted suicide may seem
humane, it is in fact a hasty, unnat-
ural and unwarranted process. As I
mentioned before, there is a differ-
ence between “pulling the plug” and
assisted suicide. The first merely
allows an event to finish what it

already started without technologi-

cal interference. The latter is techno-
logical interference actually causing
death.

It is not the doctor’s job to be an
administrator of death. Even the
American Medical Association is
against this practice.

New cures are found and new
treatments are invented every day.
But quite conceivably, there will be

occasion when all options have not

been considered before the patient
resorts to suicide.

If physician-assisted
suicide becomes
commonplace, insur-
ance companies are
likely to stop cover-
age early if they have
an out. Assisted sui-
cide is that out. They
may begin to deny
health care to termi-
nal patients — it cer-
tainly would be more
cost-effective.

Why are we as a
society even considering allowing
this to happen?

Also, if assisted suicide is per-
mitted, patients can be taken advan-
tage of emotionally by whomeveris
making the decisions.

We have deemed murder wrong.
Why is physician-assisted suicide
any different?

Human life is precious. Let’s
treat it that way.

Jennifer Stoltz will never assist a
suicide when she becomes a physi-
cian.

columnist

Even if you look behind the
refrigerator, you won’t ﬁnd a consti-
tution of any country stating the
words “Right to die.” You won’t find
one with “Right to marry” either, but
you don’t see as ‘ '
much controversy
over marriage as you
do over physician-
assisted suicide.

Personally, I’d
never end my own
life or wish to end it.
But I would not want
to deny the opportu-
nity of assisted sui-
cide to someone with
a terminal disease
who finds the pain
too unbearable, with
no possibility of a

To many, espe-
cially those with no outside source of
emotional support, death is the only
way out. If a patient with a terminal
disease is suffering from excruciating
pain and wishes to end his own life,
he should have a right to do so. It’s
not so much a right to die, but free-
dom of choice.

The American Medical
Association believes that physician-
assisted suicide is fundamentally
incompatible with the physician’s
role as healer and that physicians
must instead aggressively respond to
the needs of D patients at the end of
their lives. A

A fair point, but most final stages
of any terminal disease (cancer,
AIDS, hepatitis B, etc.) are so
painful, many patients are heavily
sedated, and any waking moment is
spent in agony. This could go on for
weeks, even months. The physician is
reduced to the role of a mere
bystander, looking on as the disease
eats away at the rest of his patient. He
can do nothing to ease the patient’s
pain, never mind bringing about a
cure.

A physician should not be forced
to assist a patient in committing sui-
cide, but should the patient make
such a request, his/her physician
should find one who will carry it out.

Dr. Jack Kevorkian may be seen

".4;gg;.;u|3|laJlmDCllllltlljltlﬂlltlitllllltran

as the vilest man on Earth to many,
but his actions were not those of a
bloodthirsty madman who got kicks
out of killing old people. His are the
actions of a man who granted his
patients their difficult request. It was
euthanasia, not cold-blooded murder,
and‘ like the dictionary definition,
Kevorkian carried
out the task with
compassion.

The Catholic
Health Association
says assisted suicide
“offends basic
moral precepts of
our culture and
poses a grave dan-
ger, to those at the
margins of our soci-
ety.” They elaborat-
ed on the margin of
society phrase, and
said they included
the poor andAminori—
ties.

I find it ridiculous that they
believe these groups are in danger;
They’re implying that doctors would
kill patients for reasons of economic
class and race. Statistically, these
groups are no more prone to commit-
ting suicide than the rest of society.

The last time I checked, suicide
was defined as the intentional killing
of oneself. If the doctor badgers the
patient into physician-assisted sui-
cide, then it’s no less than
manslaughter, but if it’s the patient’s
honest choice, that is suicide.

This is not an easy topic for me to
debate, as both my grandmothers
died of cancer. They, however, were
optimistic in nature and had a zest for
life. They would never even contem-
plate suicide, but one of my grand-
mothers told me that she knew of
quite a few friends who suffered from

cancer and who would consider

euthanasia. Like everything else, it’s
a matter of personal choice.

This issue, while in the national
limelight, should be given more
attention and should be resolved in
favor of physician-assisted suicide as
soon as possible.

James Maude will never take his own
life, but he realizes that doesn ’t mean
that nobody else can take his own

life.

finds the

promised land

It was five years ago to the night.

In 1992, Bobby ' Bonilla was
thinking about hugging his manager,
Jim Leyland, and racing onto the
field to celebrate his team’s National
League championship,

A little-known pinch-hitter

named Francisco Cabrera, however, "

had plans to spoil Bonilla and

_ Leyland’s celebration.

As Cabrera slapped a single into
left field and Sid Bream barreled
around third, the World Series was
slipping away from Leyland and his
Pittsburgh Pirates.

Bream crossed the plate, and the
Atlanta Braves were off to the Fall
Classic. '

There would be no hugging for
Bonilla. .

Only tears of despair.

In 1997, that has all changed for
the burly 12-year veteran and the
classy, cigarette-wielding manager.

They will play for the world
championship finally, except they
won’t be donning Pirate black and
gold to do it.

Even though the blue-collar
Bucs are on the rise, the days of
Pittsburgh’s contending for the title
are long gone.

Bonilla left for greener pastures
in New York, Baltimore, and now
Florida for the Marlins.

Leyland deserved to have a qual-
ity team around him, and Pirate
General Manager Cam Bonifay just
didn’t have the checkbook to bring
enough top-shelf talent to Three
Rivers.

Leyland tearfully left for the
Sunshine State, but he hasn’t forgot-
ten the people who helped him get
there.

After the Marlins’ 7-4 win over
the Braves Tuesday, Leyland sent a
message to Gene Lamont, the
Pirates’ current manager and his
long—time friend, because he knew
Lamont was watching.

“I’m finally here,” Leyland said
to the Bucs’ skipper and the world
following the victory celebration on
the rich grass of Turner Field.

Before this game, Leyland had
been 0-3 in games when his team
could have advanced to the World
Series.

Florida at Auburn (+12)

Louisiana State really messed up by
beating Florida last week. This was the
game that the Gators were supposed to
lose. Auburn, not LSU, was supposed to
be the team that challenged for the SEC
title, an honor which is automatically good
for a trip to the national—championship
game. Auburn is genuinely a national-
championship contender. Maybe when

selves in contention for a Rose Bowl bid
by beating Ohio State a few weeks ago,
but they couldn’t do it. It’s quickly
becoming apparent that Iowa doesn’t
belong in the same class as Penn State and
Ohio State, and Michigan is better than
either of those two teams. Look for Iowa
to lose this game and maybe end up with
a trip to something like the Builders’

football’s most storied rivalries. This sea-

implications whatsoever. Neither team is
all that bad, but neither is good enough to
be thinking about anything more presti-
gious than the Poulan Weed-Eater Bowl.
Notre Dame has revenge on its side.

Georgia Tech (+23 1/2) at Florida State
Florida State has the ACC’s top-rated
passing game. That should shock no one.
Georgia Tech has the conference’s most
productive rushing attack. That should
raise some eyebrows. So what happens?
You look at the defenses. Florida State’s
defense is to Georgia Tech’s defense as a
Sony PlayStation is to an Atari 2600. The
Seminoles are better, but not 23 1/2 points
better. Give the old Atari some credit.

Wisconsin (+2) at Purdue

I don’t know how Purdue got so much
respect all of a sudden. Sure, it beat Notre
Dame, but lots of teams have done that.
Wisconsin smelled up the entire state
(even worse than the cheese does) in its
season—opening embarrassment against
Syracuse. Yet the Badgers are undefeated
since that game. In the six games since
then, the Badgers have scored at least 26
points in every game. They haven’t exact-
ly been playing the best available compe-
tition, but neither has Purdue. Ron Dayne,
who is starting to look like the Heisman
candidate he was supposed to be, should

Washington at Arizona (+12)

The Wildcats are the kind of team that
nobody wants to play. They seem to at
least hang close in every game. They
proved last week against Stanford that
they can beat just about anybody in the
country. Meanwhile, Washington has been
in trouble ever since its loss to Nebraska.
The Huskies haven’t been the dominant
team that everyone thought they would be.
But, they know they should be better -
the Huskies beat Cal by 27 points last
week, and they weren’t happy with that.
When a team sees room for improvement
after a 27-point win against a respectable
team, this doesn’t bode well for its next
opponent.

Washington 27, Arizona 10

Arizona State (+1 1/2) at Stanford
Arizona State is probably the better
team on paper here. Stanford proved that
it’s far from invincible at home, losing to
Arizona last week. Still, it’s hard to ques-
tion the fact that Stanford is the favorite
here. After all, unlike the Sun Devils,
Stanford is still in the Top 25. But Arizona
State’s defense is better than Stanford’s,
and even in the run-and-gun Pac 10,
defense can make a difference. It’s a toss-
up, really, so I’m picking Arizona State,

Hoffart has never been like that.
While other kids were asking their
fathers to throw long, Jake remembers
asking dad to “throw the ball higher,
throw the ball higher! Make me dive for
it!”

He dove for it. He still does, and he
pays for it.

“I’ve been beat up a little bit,” he
said modestly, although many of the hits
he took versus Notre Dame resembled
train wrecks. “Every game so far, I’ve
had one nagging injury.”

Hoffart has started all six games this
season — despite any nagging any-
things and despite a slow start with the
new Walt Harris regime at spring condi-
tioning.

Hoffart, Matt Lytle and Demond
Gibson were among the standouts from
the 1996 squad — the last installment of
the second Johnny Majors era. Rumor
had it that the three, and others, had not
adjusted well to the new leadership.

Hoffart wasn’t on the team’s first
depth chart but fought his way into the
starting lineup for the opener versus
Southwestern Louisiana. Lytle’s and
Gibson’s quests for similar honors have
gone considerably slower.

“We had a couple miscommunica—
tions in the spring,” said Head Coach
Walt Ham's, “but we resolved them, and
he’s been the player we’ve expected him
to be ever since.”

Hoffart has been expected to play
the role of possession receiver (“I’d
never admit it,” he said, half—jokingly)
in Harris’ West Coast offense — a
scheme that requires all of its players to
be free of alligator-arms syndrome.
Quick passes over the middle are the
norm, with the occasional bomb to
Murphy set up only by the double- and
triple-coverage drawn by Hoffart.

“He really understands the
scheme,” said Harris, who coached at
Paciﬁc four years before Hoffart played
there and, according to Hoffart, doesn’t
let him forget it.

“He takes a lot of pride in U. of P.,”
said Hoffart of Harris, referring to the U.
of P. that’s much closer to the West
Coast offense’s origin. “He gets me
quite a bit with it, especially when I
make a mistake.”

So far, the mistakes have been few.
Hoffart’s skill at possession receiving
has not gone unnoticed by the head
coach — when asked what the best
aspect of the senior receiver’s play was,
Ham's simply said, “He can catch the
ball real well.”

Catching the ball real well in traffic,
in the middle of the ﬁeld, with the drive
on the line, knowing that the second
after the catch he will be hit hard
enough the fans will feel it: it’s what a
possession receiver does, and it’s what
Hoffart has done for the Panthers this
season.

COLUMN

All three were when he was with
the Pirates.

Two of the threecame against
Bobby Cox and the Braves. V

In 1991, the Pirates led the
Braves in the NLCS three games to
two, but failed to score a run in the
final “two contests and walked away
losers.

In 1992,'the Pirates led 2-0 in
the bottom of the ninth before
Cabrera’s two—out single scored
Bream and crushed Leyland’s hopes
yet again. ‘

These events took place in
Fulton County Stadium —‘— now the
parking lot right next door to the
magnificent Turner Field.

THE PITT NEWS

 

 

Different field, different team,
different outcome.

Very different outcome —— this
marks the first time in baseball his-
tory that a team that didn’t finish in
first place will play in the World
Series.

The Marlins, who didn’t even
exist when Atlanta began its record
playoff run, spent nearly $100 mil-
lion in the off—season to contend
with the Braves.

The Marlins, however, finished
nine games behind Atlanta in the
National League East at the sea-
son’s end. _ .

‘ That finish, however, was good
enough to earn Florida the wild-
card slot, and they took full advan-
tage of it to become the first wild-
card team to make it to the World

Series. ’ F

They also became the faste
expansion team to make it this far,
surpassing New York’s Miracle
Mets, who began with a whimper in
1962 and ended the 1969 finale with
a World Series ring.

After the game, Bonilla was
drowned in emotion while talking
about Leyland:

“We just’ did a lot of things
right. There’s a great deal of emo-
tion now. It took a long time for me
to get to the World Series — 12
years in the majors. I’m glad it’s
with Jim Leyland.”

The rest of the baseball world
should be glad, too.

Sports fans have learned to be
cautious when it comes to presea-
son rankings, but the Pitt wrestling
team’s No. 11—national ranking in
a recently released preseason poll
is still quite an accomplishment.

“It’s nice, because the guys
did a great job last year and
they’re being rewarded for it,”
Assistant Coach Ed Palmer said.
He added, “I think our guys are
level—headed enough to take it in
stride. It gets the adrenaline run-
ning,,and it gets them pumped up.
Now they want to prove that
they’re worthy of that ranking.”

The rankings were released by
The Amateur Wrestling News,
which uses the voting of the
National Wrestling Coaches
Association to compile the pool.

These are the rankings that are

generally accepted as the rankings

for collegiate wrestling.
Pitt ranked as the second-

highest team in its conference.
Eastern Wrestling League rival
Edinboro edged out the Panthers
to secure a 10th—place ranking,
with yet another EWL. squad,
Lehigh, ‘receiving 12th-place hon-
ors. .
“Our goals going into this sea-
son were to win the EWL champi-
onship and ﬁnish in the Top 10,”
Palmer said. “In a way, I think it’s
better that we were 11th and
Edinboro’s ahead of us. It gives us
something to shoot for.”

Pitt will take on two Top 10
schools at home this season.
Edinboro (No. 10) visits the
Fitzgerald Field House on Feb. 19,
and Penn State (No. 8) comes to
town on Feb. 14.

Palmer said that will be an
intense match, because “Penn
State and Pittsburgh are rivals in
everything.”

Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer was out of town on a
recruiting trip and was not avail-
able for comment.

PREVIEWS

Temple (2-4) at Syracuse (4-3)

After stumbling out of the gate initially
this season, the Orangemen have rattled off
three consecutive victories, in whichthey
outscored their opponents by a total of 136-
22.

Donovan McNabb leads the Big East in
quarterback rating and all-purpose yards,
but this game looks to be decided on the
ground.

Junior tailback Kyle Mcintosh leads

.
Wrestlers rank llth in early poll

mom PAGE 11

Syracuse’s running attack (he’s amassed
over 400 yards rushing on the year) against
a Temple defense that has surrendered 193.5
yards per game.

If this game comes down to special
teams, give the nod to the Orangemen, for
they sport the nation’s second—leading punt
returner in Quinton Spotwood (also the
team’s leading wide receiver) and the coun-
try’s second—leading kick returner in Kevin
Johnson.

Pucks

primarily based on the fact that they have a run-
ning back named Marlon Farlon.

This week’s Best Bet:
Texas A&M at Kansas State (+1)

Here are two of the a1l—ti1ne cupcake cham-
pions. Texas A&M, while it did travel to

Colorado, hasn’t played any team that could

reasonably be called respectable. It is 5-0, but it
should be; the Aggies have beat up on teams
that aren’t really good. Fortunately, Kansas

FROM PAGE 12

State is also not really good. It is ranked 20th,
but don’t be deceived. The Wildcats have also
beat the patootie out of some terrible teams, but
not in quite such impressive fashion as the
Aggies. When Kansas State ﬁnally played a
decent team (namely Nebraska), it got its own
patootie whipped.

Texas A&M 31, Kansas State 20
