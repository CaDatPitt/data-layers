George PIimpton- A Writer For All Seasons

BY CRISTOPEER C. HOEL

— Were George Plimpton a baseball
player, sports editors, would write
that he could “do it all.”

But George Plimpton is a
sportswriter—for “Sports Illustra-
ted.” And an editor—for the
literary magazine he founded. And,
on occasion, he’s even been a
baseball player.

"It’s a literary device,” said
Plimpton concerning his oft-used
scheme of invading the profession-
als’ world and living to write about
it. “Ienjoy it, because it’s great fun
and a great privilege to join the
various organizations, but it is
fundamentally a literary device.”

Plimpton, the headline guest of

' this year's Writers’ Conference,

also has been a football quarter-
back, race-car driver, high-wire
artist, lightweight boxer and
symphony percussionist while seek-
ing stories to soothe and entertain
the world's amateurs.

His first best-selling book,
“Paper Lion,” was the result of his
experience as a rookie quarterback
at the Detroit Lions’ pre-season

. camp. After running through drills

with the team, Plimpton was
permitted to call signals during a
four-down series in a National
Football League exhibition game.
“The quarterbacking part was
easy,” Plimpton said. “All you
have to do is learn four plays,
stumble out there and perform
them. The writing involved with

“‘lll.\\\\

W

“Paper Lion” was harder than the
playing.”

That didn’t stop Plimpton from
basing his next best-seller, “Out Of
My League,” on his ordeal on
Yankee Stadium’s pitching mound
during a post-season exhibition
contest between stars of the two
major leagues. The book, according
to Ernest Hemingway, had “the
chilling quality of a nightmare.”

In later exploits, Plimpton:
teamed with the Flying Wallendas
to perform a high-wire act; was
battered by lightweight boxing
champ Arch Moore; escaped death

The Game and Rules

Back in '74. when Nelson Algren was the featured guest at the
annual Writers‘ Conference. he related the story of a young woman
who wrote to him, saying, “I am now on the brink of a cacrleer in
writing. What do I do now?“ Algren s answer wa_S Preclse 3" W'5e'
"Take two steps backward, turn around and run.”

For those of us who do not wish to follow that profound advice, there

is only the foolhardy second

course of stepping over

precipice—writing. That decided. what next? A
In the area of nonﬁction, Bob Cornﬁeld, literary agent at Wallace

and Sheil Agency, lnc., explains, "Until you make a name for yourself.

the best thing to do is write whole articles," foregoing the usual route

of sending a query letter ﬁrst.

“When you're established." he

continued, "you can get a commission (for an article) from a magazine
or newspaper. You just tell them you have an idea (via letter). But
that's only after you have a relationship."

According to Cornﬁeld. the magazines that are really impossible to
crack by sending whole articles are magazines like “Ladies Home

Journal." “Redbook," “Playboy" and “Esquire.

‘ ‘They pay very

well, but as far as I know. they never take in something when they've

never heard of the writer.

“I think the only way to go is to take a chance." Cornﬁeld explains.
“Newspapers will take articles——they always need material. So if you
send in a short piece you might ﬁnd somebody receptive to that. He

emphasizes the chanciness. though.

“When I wanted to be a

freelancer, I sent an article to the ‘New York Times.‘ Somebody called
me and said they liked it. They asked me to revise it. but it didn t work

out.

“I don't think that would happen today. Today there is a tightening
down. They're just using their own staff. Local papers would be far

easier to attack."

Cornﬁeld explains the chances of selling a piece of ﬁctioii are better
than the chances for a nonﬁction piece. “Since magazines don  have
staff writers for ﬁction. they are probably more tolerant of looking at

someone else‘s work."

Plimpton, who said he isn’t

the sake of his literary device, even

the Baltiir'io‘re Colts.

-All the while, Plimpton was editor
of “The Paris Review,” the literary
magazine he started in 1953. ‘The
quarterly consumes much of his
time, but Plimpton still manages to

turn out an occasional, well-‘
researched documentation of what
it’s like to take on the best.

‘ ‘I don’t think it’s so difficult to do
two different things at the. same
time,” he said. “It isn’t like you
have to shift gears of anything. It’s
just that the approach is a little
different, of course. It doesn't
require anything other than an
enjoyment of what you’re doing—
and I get an enormous amount out of
both areas. I .

“My work with “The Paris
Review” is more editing than
writing. I do very little writing for
“The Paris Review’ " because I don’t
think I’m that sort of writer,” he
said. '

“I continue to work at “Sports
Illustrated” because that’s a
department of my writing,” Plimp-
ton said. ‘ ‘I don’t know how you can
divide your time among these
things, but I do enjoy it very much,
and that’s how I make my living, so I
do.”

Plimpton calls his works “Jour-
nalistic,” but that isn’t the type of
writing he ﬁrst tackled. “I worked
on my college paper,” he said, “but
it wasn’t journalism—mostly funny
sketches and things of that sort.

“While at Harvard, I was editor
of the “Harvard Lampoon,” which
always has been supposed to be a
funny paper, but never has been.

That is the sort ofwriting I was
doing.”

No matter what type of writing
Plimpton concerns himself with, he
ends up dissatisfied when the
writing is his own.

“There’s always something
wrong with your work, ” he said. “It
is much easier to be content about
someone'else’s work, though that
still is not easy.

Though he may be discontent,
Plimpton forges ahead with his
writing. And he isn’t ready to
abandon the idea that brought him
the greater deal of his fame.

“You can never run out of ideas
with this sort of writing,” he said.
“'I'here’s no lack of ideas, it’sjust a
question of choosing and doing
those stories that interest you and
that you can do a good job on.

“Right now, a good idea like that
seems to be going out on an oil
derrick and working for a while, but
that’s not all I will be doing,” he
said.

His recent time has been spent, at
least partially, with two works
concerning sporting ﬁgures. An
article on the twilight of former
Baltimore Colt center Bill Currie
appeared in “Harper’s,” and a
book on Muhammad Ali, “Shadow
Box,” is something to which
Plimpton followers can look for-
ward.

And, they can await accounts of
coming (and, probably, losing)
encounters with men who are paid
to do well at that which he only
hopes to do well enough, without
getting hurt. So far, he has escaped
injury, though an incident behind a
race-car wheel almost cost him his
life.

“The damage from undertaking
one of these assignments is mainly
psychic, ’ ’ Plimpton said.

“I’ve found that the real work is

. involved in the writing. The mental

pushing and arranging and strugg-
ling over'words is hard...It’s the
most complicated process there is.
l “I suppose I’m only saying this
because I’m not out on the ﬁeld with
Mean Joe Green right now, but to
me the most terrifying thing-in the
world is a white piece of paper.”

Colwin

BY RANDY GAYSEK

“It’s not hard to get published if
you work hard and don’t try to get
published before you’re ready,”
Laurie Colwin told me, letting me
scoop one of the subjects of her talk
at this year’s Writers’ Conference.

Colwin, who won a ’7b O’Henry
Award for her short story,‘ “The”

Lone Tailbone,” is ﬁrm in her,

belief that’ indiscriminate praise of
a person’s writing given too soon
can destroy his perspective and
damage his career.

After studying English at Bart
College and Columbia University,
she holds reservations about the
methods used in teaching creative
writing as a subject in school. She
said creativity can’t and shouldn’t
be encouraged in the writing
classroom.

“Creativity is best performed
in the privacy of one’s own home, ”
she said. “College is the place you
go to learn things that will help your

' writing, but not to become a writer.

Things can be learned in college
about writing, but the emphasis in
most writing classes is all wrong.”

Instead of an instructor‘ peering-
over the shoulders of his students
and landing their writing, _Colwin
feels he should be talking about
important writers and how they did
what they did.‘

“When I was in school,
a teacher told me I was going to be
the next Mary McCarthy and I
thought it was a stupid thing to say.
For a while Ifelt guilty about writing

I thought it was a stupid and harmful

thing to say. For a while Ifelt guilty
about writing poetry or anything
else that wasn’t a short story

The Small Press: A Commitment To Literature

BY MARTHA H. GARVEY, JR.

“Small press represents a

A commitment to literature...publish-

ing houses aren't therreal world
anymore," says Tony Petrosky of
Slow Loris Press in Pittsburgh.

Petrosky, along with Anne Pride
of KNOW, Inc., a feminist press in
Pittsburgh, and John Crawford of
West End Press in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, will be talking
about aspects of the small press
world at this year’s Writer's
Conference.

Attitude, rather than size, sets
small presses ‘apart from big
publishing houses like Random
House and Doubleday according to
the three.

“Poetry and ﬁction require effort
to publicize. and promote, and big
publishing houses aren't willing to
do that anymore," Petrosky ex-
explain_s. Crawford cites RCA and
ITT as conglomerates who now own

. publishing houses and use books of ,.

poetry and ﬁction that sell poorly as
tax write-offs. ‘

Crawford tells a story of a young
poet whose book was chosen by a
big publisher. While it was on the
press, a computer calculated the
odds on its success. The odds were
poor and the book was pulled off

Tailbone,” says creativity can’t and shouldn’t be encouraged in the
_ classroom; rather, she believes it should be demonstrated in the privacy

of one’s own- home.

Colwin thinks such comments are
deleterious to a writer's future
becausethey can slot him before he
knows what hard work is and before
he knows what he wants to do.

She stressed the importance of
the writer keeping his inner-self
alive and working as hard as
possible-.

“Writing is a form of juvenile
de1inquincy,” she said of the
expressiveness, of ﬁction. “While
other kids were out slashing tires, I

was at home writing horrid things
about everybody I knew.”

Colwin has since reformed, in a
manner of speaking, and has added
a more vicarious bent to her writing
philosophy.

“Now when I write, I sit down to
amuse myself. I’ll write, then

maybe I’ll read it and say, ‘not bad. ’
Then I’ll re-write it ﬁve or six times
and send it to my agent. I work
hard, but I've written a lot of things
that will never See the light of
day,” she said.

Hearing that a well-known and
established writer doesn't have
everything she writes published
shouldn’t deﬂate someone just
starting out, Colwin said. '

“There are a lot of magazines
around now. Somebody’s writing
for them and most of them are, or
used to be people you’ve never
heard of,” she said. . But she
warned against submitting things
for publication too soon and the
damage rejections may do. Accep-
tance can be equally damaging in

This year’s conference marks the

' ﬁfth annual gathering of noted

authors and editors at Pitt’s main
campus for a weekend of talk and
learning with Pitt students and area
writers.

The conference has a long

I _ tradition at the University, starting

back in 1946 when the late Edwin L.

' Peterson held the first ‘ ‘Conference

for Readers and Writers at Pitt.”
Peterson was a -professor of
English and founder of Pitt’s

V writing program, the ﬁrst of its kind

in the nation. Upon his retirement

 in 1967, the idea of the conference

went into mothballs until 1973 when
assistant professor of English Lee
Gutkind revived the annual
weekend.

Since then the conference has
expanded, nearly doubling its
budget through the support of many
University groups, both student and
academic.

Supporting this year’s conference
are Student Government Lectures
Committee, Student Union Board,
School of General Studies, Student
Cabinet, Graduate Student Organ-
ization, English department and
black studies department.

Thanks to this combined effort
and talent, the 1977 conference is
being presented free to Pitt
students concerned with their
writing, a spirit that Peterson might
have applauded.

Working with student directors,
assistant professor Gutkind has
brought many leading national
literary figures to Pittsburgh
including Dan Wakeﬁeld, John
Knowles, Nelson Algren, Nicholas
Von Hoffman, Herbert Gould and

“It's a kind of abortion," Crawford
says.

There is a sense of community
among the small presses, Petrosky
says. All three presses rely on
mailing lists to publicize their
works. Slow Loris publishes a
magazine, “Rapport,” small books
of poetry (most recently, “The End
of the Ice Age,” by Pitt English

_ANNEPRIDE

professor Ed Ochester) and collec-
tions of broadsides—individual
poems printed on ﬁne quality paper
and collected in folios. Contribu-
ting poets include Joyce Carol
Oates and Robert Bly.

West End Press has published
“West End Magazine" for six
years and only branched into
publishing last year. Its first book
is a. collection of poems by Pitt

s’ Conference   

this year’s featured guest George
Plimpton.

The conference has continued to
expand its offering to Pitt students
and the wider Pittsburgh writing
community, with this year’s con-
ference touching on almost every
aspect of the literary craft—from
writing the short story to the literary
market, from the alternate press
and publishing to children's
literature.

Through formal presentations
and informal gatherings the con-
ference has presented a unique
opportunity for Pittsburgh people
with a committment to writing to
share their work and their
perspectives with invited guests
and each other.

‘‘In the women's movement,
only in the area of publishing have

we completed a cycle where we are ‘

completely self-sufficient," Pride
explains. In many feminist
presses, all writing, editing,
printing and promoting are done

completely by women. Among the’

successful feminist presses exist-
ing now. Pride names Aphra,
Shameless Hussy, and Daughters,
lnc. (publishers
Brown's “Rubyfruit Jungle”).
Feminist press provides an
option for the established writer,

Pride explains, because it publish--

es work that large companies
refuse to touch. Adrienne Rich,
author of “Diving into the Wreck,”
and winner of the National Book
Award, has been publishing
increasing amounts of her work in
the small presses—a collection of
love poems to a woman, “Amazon
Poetry," and an essay in a new
small magazine called “Heresies.”
Large publishers are unwilling to
take a chance on hurting the poet's
image—or theirs.

West End Press publishes the
writer who has traditionally had no
image-the trade union member,
the prisoner, the peoples of the
third world, according to Crawford.
In his efforts to ﬁnd these writers,

Take a look around and listen. Pitt's mass media have this campus
covered. Look on shelves, on filing cabinets. in chairs. on desks, in
arms, on the floor; in fact. look anywhere on campus and you’re bound to
either see or hear evidence of the Pitt media.

University-generated publications geared to faculty and alumni, a
literary magazine or two. a student operated radio station and three
student newspapers characterize this media. And each has a different
impetus, a different reason for being. I

The student media, for instance, has a dual purpose—training
students as writers, reporters, broadcasters and editors, and producing

a professional product.

“The radio station has to provide a professional product to the people
who are paying for us—the students. We have the same problem every
organization has of disillusioned new members, but Ithink we do a fairly
good job. People realize they can’t expect to get on the air until they
have something air worthy," Dan Rosenthal, the past general manager

of the campus radio station, said.

WPGH, according to a station estimate, teaches an audience of

approximately 3,000 Pitt students in dorms.

The station offers its

listeners with a number of special features not usually offered by other
local stations, Rosenthal said, such » as Howard Cosell on Sports,
American Contemporary Radio News and campus news.

On the other hand, the Pitt News, which publishes three times weekly
and which has a circulation of 13,000, is perhaps the most widely-read

student publication on campus.

The newspaper and WPGH are
plagued by a high staff turnover
rate with reporters and editors
changing frequently.

“We’re always looking for good
writers and nobody who could be a
good reporter is turned away,” Pitt
News editor-in-chief Cris Hoel said.

The School of General Studies
(SGS) though fewer in number than
full-time students nevertheless,
have their own voice on campus,
The Nite Times.

The Nite Times publishes once
every two weeks and is staffed by
approximately 20 part-time stu-
dents. Its purpose, according to
editor Bob Podurgiel, is to provide
information of particular interest to
night students. Two of the paper’s
biggest issues he said are student
parking and security in Oakland and
around campus.

“We can’t compete with the Pitt
News, but on certain things we can
have a different voice. There’s a
need for more healthy competition

-in journalism, both campus and

local. It’s good for the students,"
Podurgiel said.

There are, however, publications
on campus that aren’t journalis-
tically oriented.

Backspace, formerly Ideas and
Figures, is devoted to publishing
student fiction and poetry.
Backspace is now marking its
second year of existence.

Besides printing two issues a
year, Backspace sponsors student
poetry readings around campus. It
is also considering issuing broad-
sides of poetry and prose, in the
near future to be distributed to the
students at large, according to
editor Alex Levin.

“Backspace helps bring together
the student writers in the Univer-
sity. It serves as a focal point for
many interested writers. We try to
put out as good a quality magazine
as we can,” Levin said. .

The latest issue of Backspace,
published in January, has 1,000
copies already in circulation—a
large number for a small press run
according to Levin.

Eureka and Capsule are two

schoolin’ which began in early
childhood parochial training and
ended, formally at least, with
Simpson College and the Goodman

Memorial Theatre School of
Drama.
Throughout these times the

writing and acting went on, not
because it was nice to ‘do, or
‘because wouldn’t it be great if, but
because, like her own terms, it was

necessary. 7
“I started writing at about
seven,” she says. “By 13 I was

seriously into it. It was my way of
keeping mentally alive, and dealing
with the scream you‘go around
with, the one you get in the process
of living. Writing was—is my
safety valve.”

Along the way, the scream has
been channeled into poetry, and
performances in more than 18
theatrical productions ranging from
Chantal in “The Balcony” and the
Hitchy-Koo Girl in “Oh What A
Lovely War.” There have also
been times when the scream has
subordinated itself to the other

necessary demands of reality and
ﬁnance. In case nobody ever told
you, there ain’t a helluva lot of
money to be made from the arts,
especially those with a poetic base.
Like y’mamma said, never marry a
musician.

These realities, according to
Austin, dictate that, “I earn my
living by a number of means. I
have to do and do commercial
writing in the form of public
relations for community groups and
organizations fromed around social
causes. I don't -mind the selling if
the groups sell concepts that I can
go along with ideologically.”

True enough, she’d much rather
deal with her own writing,
performing and directing. She
does not, however, cast a long nose
down at “commerical writing.” In
the long run, it too is necessary.

“Creative people need to devel-
op many ways of earning the buck.
You're not going to be able to write
or act if you’re hungry. And
because America starves its_artists,
you should prepare yourself to get
some eats. Develop yourself across

The Poet Breathes   Fantasy

BY MREA CSORBA

David Ignatow is a surrealist
poet, Ed Ochester from Pitt's
English Department tells me, and
Ignatow confirms it over the phone.

“I draw images from a bed of
fantasy that goes beyond reality,”
Ignatow says, stressing the ‘sur’ in
sur-"realism. His books contain
typed-out evidence of the fantasies
of his mind.

“The fork I raise to my mouth

should be the fork in a dream; the

kiss I give should be the kiss

given in a dream. The dream I

would be having would be of the

world as it should be...the feel of

a fork in’ my hand like that of

silk...How may I live in silkiness

until the dreams bring me to
death entered with a silky ease.”

Iread it, his poetry glibly slipping
over my tongue, the hard coldness
of the stainless steel fork softing
into silvery silk; his verse lulling me
with the hypnotic power of a river's
silky current. ‘

David Ignatow can be a realist
poet, Ochester, our Steel City poet
says, and Ignatow agrees. “In
between periods of surrealism, I've
done hard-core realism,” he says,
and directs me to his protest poems
against the killing of Vietnam.

’ “The president's blood is on my
hands; he has taken another
decision, this time to smash the
dikes. His life is full of weeping in
self-pity at the cruelties he must
impose...Blood covers him entir-
ely from his weeping eyes. My
President, my poems are stained
with blood, poems in which blood
runs down the page, poems that
have holes in them the size of
shrapnel wounds, poems that
peel off from paper like napalmed
skin...” ,

His earlier surrealistic flow of
words splinter into sharp bits of ice
that gnashagainst one another as

Winner of the prestigious Bollinger award, David Ignatow, a
surrealist poet, claims, “the best poetry is written from personal
experiences,” stressing that a poet’s verse must illuminate not only
himself, but also the world in which he lives.

they sink to the pit of my stomach. I
wince from the intrusion of hard
reality. ' .
Mysource "says Ignatow is an
urban poet, and the poet from New
York City responds matter-of-factly
—“The best -poetry is written from
personal experiences.” He quali-
ﬁes the stock deﬁnition stressing
that a poet's verse must illuminate
not only himself, but the world in
which he lives. ‘
, Ochester says Ignatow is the
prime inﬂuence of what poetry has
become. Ignatow says he reduces
high falutin’ verse to street level. I
read a poem which lightly phrases
the serious subject of brother/ sister
humanity. “Yes, I was out to visit
with my friends at . the bar

9

yesterday...’ it begins in - a
surprisingly easy address.’ At it’s
conclusion I say, ‘_‘Yes, I grok what

you’re saying, though Ithoughtyou V

were being ﬂippant at first.”

Ignatow’s recognition has been
slow in coming, Ochester says, but
the 62 year old poet claimed it last
month in the form of the prestigious
Bollinger Award presented to him
for forty years of work.

A democratized style of verse
brought poetry, itself, into its own,
both poets agree. And as a
franchaized member of the poetry-
reading constituency--having
freshly discovered de-mystified
poetry—I’ welcome the straight-
forward communal of our souls in
their rhythmic language.

a wide spectrum."

The narrow ivory-towering that
withins-withouts the ‘educated’
public and practitioners of the arts
has no room in Austin’s eclectic
personal space. The particular ‘I
Am An Artist’ sniff which equates
‘commercial writing’ with ‘selling
out’ leads to what she considers an

. elitism which suffocates the artist

and the art. It imposes limits on
the artist, and hinders the two most
important things a creative person
can do, that is, touch those special
feelings inside and communicate
those feelings to others.

Rather than specify, the elitist
labels separate, not only the artist
from the public, promoting him or
her as libertine or alien. On a
deeper level, the elitism separates
and denigrates racially and cultur-
ally as well.

“Consider,” she says, “the fact
that you’re taught the peotry of

Jonathan Aldrich

BY MICHELE ROTHERT

Jonathan Aldrich, 41, is-a”ﬁctiorL
writer and poet. His hair is dark
blonde; his eyes are green, and he
lives in Berea, Kentucky with his
wife Nancy and children Tess and
Tom. Currently, he teaches English
at Berea College.

Aldrich’s poems have appeared
in a number of local Kentucky
magazines. Many, in addition,
have been published in the
‘ ‘Chicago Review, ’ ’ ‘ ‘ Massachu-
setts Review,” “West Coast Poetry
Review,” and “Southern Poetry
Review.”-

“In college, I was interested in
essays and short stories,” Aldrich
says in a voice slightly tell-tale of a
New England upbringing. ‘ ‘In fact,
Ioriginally won a scholarship to the
Bread Loaf School of English in
Vermont for exposition and short
stories.

“I was so picky with words, I
decided I might as well write
poems. I like the formal element of
poetry,” he explains.

“Croquet Lover at the Dinner
Table’ ’ is the title of Aldrich ’s latest

book of poems, which centers
around a Shaker village in
Massachusetts during the nine-
teenth and twentieth centuries. It is
expected to appear on bookstands
this month.

“I was born in Boston,” he
reflects. “When I was a child, I
wanted to be a cowboy. Then for
awhile, I wanted to be a lawyer
because my father was one.” He
laughs, “I read all the Perry Mason
books! .

“In the eleventh grade, a teacher
helped me develop my writing
interest. In college, I continued to
write stories; and, in the last year of
college, I started to write poems.”

“Now, I have two goals: to
continue writing and to be a, good
teacher.”

Aldrich teaches at a college that is
unique because all the students are
on scholarship. “At Berea, all are
involved in a work-study program.
Each works outside of classes.
Freshmen start out with jobs not so
pleasant, such as food service; but,
after that, they work up" to jobs of
their own choice such as teachers

and aesthetics are not mutually exclusive.
was a commercial success, called ‘Interview With A Vampire,’ that was
the writer’s ﬁrst novel. When I read the book I didn’t say to myself:
‘I’m going to buy this book because people are into vampirism.’ I
bought it because it affected and compelled me in a particular way. It
was unlike anything I had read before.”

’ It seems there is no substitute for excellence in story telling, yet-
valuable_as artistry is, professionalism can’t hurt.‘ An aspect of that
professionalism is the reduction of mistakes. Is there any error that
beginners make more often than any other? While Vicki Wilson
mentioned a tendency to “excessive cuteness” in correspondence, C.
Michael Curtis, associate editor at “Atlantic Monthly,” wasn’t
inclined to pin down a certain ill. V

“I don’t believe that freelance writers starting out behave
signiﬁcantly differently than freelancers who have been in the business
for 40 years,” Curtis explains. “Some of them haven't had very much
experience as reporters, so they often don’t have a very clear feeling of
how to find their story, what sort of information is essential to the story
development, and the magazine for which they are aiming.

‘‘If I had advice to give, it would be to read whatever magazine they
have in mind very carefully and make a conscious effort to understand
how its articles are put’together and what sort of information" is
included. You do that to develop a sense of what evidence is necessary
to support a-contention, how much interest the magazine seems to
show in the characterization of people who are described in the article‘
and how to include them in the questions raised in the article.”

‘Curtis points to the obvious fact that most «publications expect
writers to conform to their standards. But, there are literary
publications which base their existence on experiment." Among the
foremost of these is “The.Paris Review."

As George Plimpton, founder andxeditor, explains, “As you can‘.tell, .

‘The Paris Review’ is ‘devoted to creative material—short stories and
poems. The sort that are out of the mainstream and make no
compromise with public taste. ‘The Paris Review’ is for people who are
trying to ﬁnd new ways of presenting their narratives. The sort of
_serious work for which there is not very much of a market.”
Although selling what you write may be difﬁcult, according to
Cornﬁeld. Wilson. Curtis and Plimpton, it isn't any reason to give up
freelancing.

William

BY MICHELE ROTHERT

William Joyce pushes through
the swinging Cathedral doors into a
hallway of college students. His
brown eyes are opened wide, his
breath comes quickly, and beneath
his beard stretches an invisible ear-
to-ear grin.

Joyce smiles inwardly. Speaking
before a class excites the thirty-four
year old ﬁction writer and poet. At a
quick pace, he walks toward Room
327, Seminar in Writing 172, where
he was asked to be today's guest.

Joyce, dark-haired and thin, is
carefreely dressed in blue jeans,
sweater, and sneakers. He ﬁnds the
door.

Five minutes later, Joyce is
reading aloud to ﬁfteen ominous
faces. It is a section of his short
story, “You Can’t Lose With an
Echo Harp,” which takes place in
Pittsburgh.

“They rode along Liberty
Avenue for a mile or so, past cut-
rate clothing stores, massage
parlors, and soot-colored stone
hotels with neon signs that
always had one letter missing.
Liberty Avenue curved then over
a stretch of road lined with trolley
tracks. It had been ten years
since the last red trolley, but the
tracks hadn’t been removed and
every few seconds they threw the
Rambler ﬁrst one way then the

’ ‘other till Crenshaw felt his
mother’s noodle casserole bolting
in his gullet.” ’

A girl with glasses and a ﬂushed
"face, sitting by the trash basket in
the corner ofithe room, raises her
hand and asks, “Why are you a
Pittsburgh writer?”

- “I don’t think of myself as just a '

Pittsburgh writer,” Joyce replies.

Joyce

“As writers, we should be faithful
to our imaginations, not an actual
place. Still, when I started writing,
certain images kept showing up in
my stories such as smokestacks and
tunnels. I wasn’t living in
Pittsburgh, and I couldn’t under--
stand it. Then, suddenly, I realized,
‘Christ, I’m from Pittsburgh!’ ”

Currently, Joyce‘ holds the
Andrew Mellon Post-doctoral Fel-
lowship in English, which is second
in size only to the Guggenheim. The
fellowship requires him to adapt
Pittsburgh history to ﬁction.

“I grew up in the richest city
production-wise during the forties.
No city around the world has
produced like Pittsburgh. ‘Pitts-
burgh is not realistic; that's why it
attracts me. In writing about
Pittsburgh, I've tried to make
characters come to life, to be as real
as your own grandmother, and to
give the city vividness and
exuberance—to make Pittsburgh,
in fact, a character.”

Joyce’s poetry and ﬁction have
been published in forty journals-
from “Mademoiselle,” “The Paris
Review,” and “New Letters” to the
‘ ‘ Western Humanities Review. ’ ’
His stories twice were cited for
distinctive mention in “Best
American Short Stories.” As a free
lance magazine writer, he contrib-
uted regularly to “Roto Sunday
Supplements;” and, in 1976, he
won a $1,000 grant from the
Connecticut Committee on the Arts
to develop a book of short stories. In
addition, he worked for KDKA-TV
News as a film writer and reporter.
And he won the Bicentennial Poetry
Contest for his poem, “The
Lacrosse Game.” '

Small Press : Commitment

Crawford has sent ﬂyers and copies
of his magazine to trade unions (“a
teachers‘ union sent back a stiff

_ little note") and has posted notices

in laundromats. Crawford also
plans to publish the ‘late Chilean
poet Pablo Neruda’s last book, “An

‘ Invitation to Nixonicide," which

publisher Farrar, Straus, refuses to
print on the grounds that is would
hurt the poet's literary reputation.

Pitt ‘student Peter Oresick’s
“The Story of Glass" underlines
the accessibility of small press
versus New York publishing. Pitt
English professor ‘Ed Ochester
introduced Oresick to Crawford
when he was visiting in town.
Oresick sent him a manuscript and
Crawford decided to publish it. In
his book. Oresick talks about his
Ukranian roots. his working-class
background in Ford City, and
Pittsburgh Plate Glass.

“Small press work," explains
Crawford, "is a labor of love." In
part-. it's the phenomenan of the

lefties outliving everyone else. You
give up on stability."

Crawford attributes the huge
growth of the small press in the
'60s to what Pride calls “the
liberation of the mimeograph."
Printing equipment has become
smaller, cheaper and faster. And
now, Crawford says, anyone can
"print the works of Freud in your
basement." This massive avail-
ability, in turn, " reduced the
attitude of elitism in existing small
presses. “Small presses stopped
thinking they were going to be the
one to publish the next James
Joyce.“

While many established poets
are still with large publishers, they
are not happy, Crawford says. He
points to poets Robert Bly, Richard
Hugo and William Stafford who
depend increasingly on the small
presses to publish their work
be_cause “they know that the small
press will do'a good job." Robert
Creeley.v whose last book. was

published by Scribner’s wrote a
letter to the American Poetry
Review "disowning" the book
because of the editorial changes
made by the company.

“We don't make money,’ says
Petrosky. “We publish literature
we believe in. If people get no
support for what they're doing,
they usually stop doing it.”

Petrosky lists the broadsides as the A

only money makers at Slow Loris,
with the books breaking even and
themagazine “a definite loss, but
it's a way of getting literature out

Aspects of Creativity,
The Rites of Politics

BY JIM LEWIS

Disillusionment. Michael Hen-
derson lived in a world of it as a
speech writer for the Prime

‘ Minister of his motherland, New

Zealand.

“I thought the job would help me
in my desire to become a writer,”
the Pitt assistant professor ex-
plained. “I imagined I would get to
see the world. Some very ﬁne
writers were part of their country's
diplomatic service.”

But he soon found such political
work didn’t leave much time or
energy for personal writing. Even
worse, he often had to use words
“in a rather corrupt way."

‘‘I was having to design
speeches, briefs and papers for
political ends,” he admitted. “For
someone who cares about the use of
language—especially imaginative-
ly—it was a very sickening
business. At the time, New Zealand
had troops in Vietnam and I became
aware of lies and half-truths. I
didn’t want to be part of it any
more.”

So Henderson resigned his post
to live a hermit’s life in a cabin along
the Paciﬁc Ocean.

“In the next four years I devoted
myself entirely to my imaginative
writing,” he recalled. “I wrote my
ﬁrst novel, several short stories,
poems and began some work in
children’s literature.”

Included in that four-year pil-
grimage is the creation of two works
he will read from at the Writers’
Conference—-“The Log of a Super-
ﬂuous Son” (a novel) and “The
Dead Bush” (a short story which
won the 1976 Fels Award,
sponsored by the National Endow-
ment for the Arts, as one of the
outstanding short stories published
in America in 1975). The setting for
both works, as well as most all his
writing, is, as one can guess, New
Zealand.

“The ﬁction should give Amer-
icans some feeling for New Zealand
and the Paciﬁc,” Henderson said.
“in particular, the pieces should
convey something of the ﬂavor of
farmlife in the hill country.”

But the excerpts Henderson will
be reading are much more than
pastel prints of the ﬂora and fauna
of beautiful New Zealand; they are
reflections of his enlightened life.

“What I’ll be reading certainly
grows out of elements of my life,”
Henderson agreed, “but in the
actual detail that emerges in the.
ﬁction there is scarcely ever an
exact correlation. I think that I
could not have written it without
having lived the life I’ve lived; but I
ﬁrmly believe if a piece of ﬁction is
going to come alive on paper, it
must take on its own life
independent of that of its creator.”

“Log” is independent of its
author, yet dependent as well. The
protagonist shares the same basic
beliefs of its creator.

“The character in the novel is
upset by the govemment’s action in

leaves.” With a smile, he bends
forward in his seat, encountering
ﬁfteen pairs of blinkless eyes. “I
used to clean out oil furnaces and
scrape them with wire brushes.
When I was a journalism major at
Penn State, I quit in the middle of
my sophomore year to go to Chicken
of the Sea Tuna and become a ﬁsh
dumper. Once I had a job watching
a basket ﬁll up with cans, and I was
a night clerk at Howard John-
son’s.”

“How do you get ideas to write
about?” asks a deep-voiced fellow
by the blackboard.

“You look for ideas, but a lot of

them just happen such as in -

overheard conversations. One
Christmas Eve, I drove to the
Trailways Bus Station. All the bums
were around, and there was a ﬁght
between the mop-up man and the
manager. Someday, I’ll write about
that.”

Joyce slips a cigarette from his-

hip pocket and lights it with a
match.

“When I was a high school
student, we developed our writing
talents by writing letters—” He
stops speaking, takes a puff, retains
the smoke, then continues with one
long exhale, ‘ ‘We’d pick some poor,
unknowing fellow and write a love
letter for him. Then we’d deliver it
to the quiet, equally endowed girl
across the aisle.”

A guffaw engulfs the class. Joyce
laughs too, then leans back in a
wobbling desk chair and crosses his
legs.

“When we were growing up,
there was no pressure on us to
succeed; therefore, we did not take
life seriously. There was this
beatcop in Swissvale, for example,
who wanted to be one of us, so he
said he could handcuff himself to a
parking meter and get out of them.

Well, you know what happened! We
ended up calling the police for
him!”

“Life becomes an adventure,
which writing is. That’s why
Pittsburgh is an extension of all the
people I have imagined. Origins of
Shat is the name of the novel I am
working on now. It takes place in
Pittsburgh. Shat is the past tense of
shit.” .

A student by the window raises
her hand. “What will you do
next?” she asks.

“I don’t know,” Joyce says
nonchalantly. “An English profes-

. sor wrote to the Associated Writers

Program for somebody to read
ﬁction. There are not very ‘many
Writers who travel to places and
read their stories. Going around
and reading ﬁction is very unique. ’ ’
His eyes light up. “I might do that
after I get my book of poems and
novel finished.”

Autobiography-The Heart of Fiction?

BY CAROL KUPERSTOCK

Ingrid Bengis, who says she's
“stubbom as hell,” considers
herself a writer, a woman and a
human being.

In that order?

She hesitates, anticipating dis-
approval, then plunges ahead,
stubborn as hell: ”Yesl Yes,
exactly in that order.”

In addition to articles for major
magazines such as “MS.” and
“Vogue,” the New York-based
author has published an autobio-
graphical analysis of male/female
and female/female relationships,
“Combat In The Erogenous Zone,”
and an autobiographical novel, “I
Have Come Here To Be Alone.”
Unsurprisingly, then, the topic of
her lecture at the ﬁfth annual
Writers’ Conference on Saturday,
March 19, will be “Autobiography
into Fiction.” '

‘ ‘All ﬁction is autobiographical-
even"what you choose to notice,
what you perceive. You begin with

autobiography, the real things
which are your foundations, and
then you ﬁnd ways to transform
them by imagination.” 7

Fiction, she says, is the most
truthful art form, more truthful than
reality, since it reaches below the.
surface experience _and extends
beyond a single context.

“Suppose I hear an argument on

42nd Street. I might turn that
argument into a conversation
between two people who love each
other—combined, of course, with
the kinds of experiences I’ve had
myself. Thus, ﬁctionalized, it
reaches more people and takes on a
greater truth than what’s merely
literal.”

According to Bengis, autobiogra-
phy transcends experience and
becomes a sense of life; the literal
events of the novel are external
equivalents for the more abstract,
internal motivations. Thus the
writer must maintain a constant
scrutiny of her own emotions,
consciously ﬁltering all phenomena

journals written by science and
pharmacy students respectively.
Each are published at least once a
year. The University's official

' yearbook The Owl is also compiled

solely by Pitt students.

The Black Action Society News,
according to editor Carl Redwood is
more like a journal than a
newspaper. An outgrowth of the
Black Action Society, the papers

purpose, Redwood said, “is to.

counter the oppression of blacks in
the University.”

“We are not trying to be a
Pittsburgh Courier for the students
at Pitt ‘as far as getting out
information. We are trying to be a
paper linking up racism and
national oppression in all its form

throughout the country. Our
purpose is to not just get people to
read and learn things from it, but to
elevate them to action,” Redwood
said.

Organization is the paper’s
biggest problem at this point,
Redwood said. It publishes
infrequently and the staff ﬂuctuates
around each issue.

On the University side, the office
of News and Publications produces
the University Times and Pitt
Magazine as well as innumerable
news bulletins, ﬂyers and publicity
materials.

The University Times which is
published bi-weekly is distributed
internally and is intended predom-
inantly for faculty and staff
members.

The Times is concerned mainly
with University events making few
references to student affairs.

‘'1 don’t want to see us as a house
organ. We try to be independent.
Nobody sees our copy except the
director of news and publications
andso far we’ve managed to stay
clear of any problems,” editor
Mildred Neely said.

Pitt magazine comes out quar-
terly, its publication alternating
with that of the the Alumni Times
which is produced by the ofﬁce of
Development and Alumni affairs.

V It is intended for Pitt alumni and
“friends” of the University. These
“friends” according to Director of
News and Publications Mary Ann
Aug, includes donors, trustees and
foundations.

through her,own sensibilities. She
must notice herself noticing.

A sense of isolation and pain
pervades Bengis’s work. She sees
this as an inevitable aspect of being
a writer and an independent
woman. «

“Writers and other artists spend
tremendous amounts of time alone.
We’re closer to the condition of
loneliness as an ongoing thing.
Other ’people ﬁnd it easier to
distract themselves. It can create
too much /concentration on the self,
but it increases the depth of
understanding, what it means to be

_ alive. That’s the best thing a writer

can have. -

“Of course, it makes life more
difficult. You can’t afford the usual
defenses, you’ve got to always be
breaking yours down in order to
have an unobstructed perception of
self and the world around you.”

Acute awareness of self perme-
ates all of her work, from the
intensely personal ‘ ‘Combat’ ’ to the
recently released autobiographical
novel to most of her magazine
publications as well. For example,
from a “MS.” article about
traveling in Italy:

“Two nights have invisibly
blended into one. ‘I have eaten
nothing in almost twenty-four
hours, and feel myself on the ﬁne
edge of hysteria: ' no home to
disappear into, no friends to call,
again I am traveling ‘alone, no
haven ahead of . me: the
boundaries of the familiar stop
at the perimeters of my own
skin.” '

Bengis admits her approach has
its liabilities. Hypersensitivity to
the nuances of human behavior can
become a form of emotional
hypochondria, she says, . but
believes, like Henry James, that
above all, writers must be “intense
perceivers” upon whom nothing is
lost.

“You have to keep yourself from

- getting used to anything. Writers

are more acutely aware of pain and
we use that awareness, we have to.

. something to do with

* Fitzgerald.

We’re lucky we have a channel in
which to use it.” '
Bengis echoes the traditional

' advice to young writers: write about

what you know. But what you know,
she adds, may mean what you
empathize with or what you can

I

imagine; feeling a thing is a way of?-

experiencing it.
“Writing is a way of formulating
a question, a life question. It is
literally a matter of life or death.”
How then does a writer make
sense of her life, of her, work?

“You neverldo, you’re always
looking, it’s a constant, constant

quest. If you think you’ve found the I

answer, you’ stop writing. We tell
the same story over and over. I
don’t know what mine is exactly be-
cause I’m still ﬁnding different
ways of telling it. But it’s got
internal
conﬂicts which bring people close to

. what they want and then tear the

away again.”

According to Bengis, ﬁction
writers should not write about
writing—-it doesn’_t reverberate suf-
ﬁciently as a theme and it further
restricts an already limited perspec-
tive. Like John Updike’s compari-
son of writers and housewives?

‘ ‘It’s true, you know. Writers at;
housewives both stay at home ‘a
good deal. They go out in'the
middle of the day to shop for
groceries. They’re exposed to
boredom, enclosed in small spaces,
have little contact with the outside
world. In a way, writers do suffer
from housewives’ syndrome. ”

Young writers should also be
wary-of publishing too soon, she
says, since one of the dangers of
early exposure is that the writer
becomes overly inﬂuenced by the
public’s perception of who she is. —

“At 16, I was imitating Emily
Dickenson. At 21, I was F. Scott
At 28, when I ﬁrst
published, I had at least found my
own voice. It takes a while to get
formed, to evolve your own shape
and style. Mine’s still evolving.”

story is read and enjoyed by adults
as well.

“A String in the Harp” by Nancy
Bond is one example of a

well-written, interesting novel for «

young people. The 370-page runner
up for the Newbery Award (the
award for children’s stories) is
about an American family living in
Wales. The double plot involves a
ffather and three children recovering
from the loss of their mother and a
mysterious harp key that once
belonged to Taliesin of King
Arthur’s court.
Bond’s idea came to her when she
was studying at the College of
C.S. Lewis
wrote that the best reason to write
for young people is “...because a
children’s story is the best art form
for something you have to say...”
Bond’s novel was written in this
5W3)’-
“I didn’t really write it for kids
speciﬁcally,” Bond said. “The year
I spent going to library school I lived
with a Welsh family. I wanted to

show in the book my love for that
country and people.

“I only had a hazy idea of what I
was going to do. And when I was
done, I realized the book was for
children because it’s written from a
child’s point of view.

‘ ‘But I wanted to write a book that
could be enjoyed on an adult level as
well.”

As a children’s librarian, Bond
has a general idea of what
youngsters like. However, she’s
never taken any courses in child
psychology.

“I don’t think formal classes
would have helped me,” Bond said.
‘ ‘As long as the book is well written
and honest, children will like it’.

“My advice would be to write as
naturally as possible without
writing down and without aiming
the book at a speciﬁc age group.
They try to ﬁnd a market.” ’

“The “Horn Book Magazine” is
the chief one for children’s books
markets, ’ ’ explains Margery Evern-
den Gulbransen, a Pitt professor of

that it may impart a false sense of
writing security, she said.

“By the time I got my ﬁrst short
story published ‘in New Yorker
magazine seven years ago, I had

"been writing for 13 years. I waited a

long time a before I submitted

was good,” she said.

One big let-down of publishing
that Colwin pointed out is that doing
so makes no drastic changes in a
writer's lifestyle.

“It's not such a great thing to be
published,” she said. “The world

stated. “The protagonist in the
novel feels nauseated about military
involvement because he sees New
Zealand soldiers as nothing more
than meat salesmen.

possibly the main reason New
Zealand fought alongside the
United States in Vietnam was
nothing more than economic
self-interest. If they didn’t provide
at least a modest ‘force, then
Washington would not have in-

from New Zealand.”

Colwin is devoted to writing, not
necessarily just getting published.
She sees writing as a release, a
safety, as an expression, and this is
probably her most important
perspective on writing. It’s good to
be talented, she said, but she
advised against depending solely on
talent when pursuing a writing
career.

“Talent isn’t everything,” she

said. “If I had a nickel for every

Religious magazines, however, are
an easy way to publish. There are
also specialized nature magazines,
such as “Ranger Rick,” for
non-ﬁction.

“The writer of children’s stories
needs the same qualities that any
writer needs,” Gulbransen said,
“such as love of the English
language and a willingness to work
and rework.

“In addition, a writer needs a
sense of story—danger, people
solving problems. The writer also
needs a respect for children to be
able to project himself imaginativ-
ely into their lives.

“And, of course, he needs
originality. Too many stories I've
seen are rewrites of old plots.”

Gulbransen advises writers to
keep the vocabulary simple and use
less depth than for adults,
especially for “how-to” articles.
Bond, however, disagrees.

“I ‘didn’t think about the
language in my book,” Bond said.

“When I proofread, I read the.

There’s a lot you pick up from
listening to your work. I was more
worried about the sound and

literature have been realistic plots
of people today, especially stories
with girls as main characters.

Women
BY MAGGIE PATTERSON

For so long, the women we have
read‘ about have been women seen
through the eyes of men. “What is
exciting now is that women ‘can
write about women and see women
through their own eyes...All of a
sudden you get the chance to create
yourself, to give birth to yourself.”

That ispart of “Being a Writer,
Being a Woman——Dimensions,”
according to Anita Mallinger, who
will address the Writers’ Confer-
encelon that topic. Mallinger, an
assistant professor of English,
teaches a number of writing courses

talented person I know who sits
around watching television, I'd be a
rich girl. It’s what you do with your
talent that’s important.”

Majoring in writing in college
does not guarantee a writing career,
just as getting a Phd. in physics
won't guarantee a job upon
graduation, Colwin said.

“College is a time to experiment
and play around,” Colwin said.
If you need‘ a class to make you
write, you’re a prisoner of the
wrong discipline. When you can see
your own ﬂaws for yourself, you’re
on your way to becoming a writer,
but it’s' a process that never stops. ’ ’

conscious. Ithink I’ll be all right as
soon as I ﬁnish this book.”

But is it worthwhile for a new
writer to try to break into this ﬁeld?

“The market isn’t good "
Gulbransen said, “but there's
always a place for a good new
talent.”

  Add Dimensions

including the popular ‘ ‘Women and
Writing,” which she herself
proposed and developed.

“The reason I call my talk
‘dimensions’ is that the word
suggests possibility and broadening
out. It is all the opposites of
limitation and restriction,” says
Mallinger, an admitted optimist on
the subject of women. “Dimen-
sions” will expand through time to
look at women writers—past,
present and future.

“I think we tend to think of the
past as some time surind which we
were restricted, conﬁned, and
limited.” While all that is true, the
heritage of women writers is a rich
one that includes the struggles of
women who broke through that
conﬁnement and those who tried
but didn’t, she explains. _

“I am looking very carefully at
how we write has been inﬂuenced
by the style of lives we have lived. ”
That, Mallinger says, includes not

only the big picture of what women.
choose to talk about and not to talk
about, but the nitty gritty.

’ A professor at another university
told one of her students that he
didn't like her voice. “It was odd
because a lot of us here did like her
‘voice.’ Her ‘voice’ was slow. It
was rich in detail. What we got to
thinking was how much did the way
she sounded on paper have to do
with being a woman, ” she wonders.

For many years, women readers
have not been able to ﬁnd
themselves in the female characters
of fiction. Mallinger contends. “I

have a friend who said she could’
remember reading books and
thinking there was something
wrong with her because she always
identiﬁed with the men. It was
always the men who were doing all
the activities. ..Some of us who have
been-more active would naturally
read ‘ ‘War and Peace” and identify
with Pierre.”

The burgeoning of women writers
in the past few years has opened
‘ ‘marvelous opportunities’ ’ for both
the woman writer and reader,
Mallinger believes. “We can not
only put ourselves and the women
around us on paper now, we can
start creating...women heroes-
women like the woman in Margaret
Atwood’s “Surfacing.” We can
start creating .a whole new
mythology for women. Not the
virgin goddess and teh castrating
bitch, but a woman we can really
relate to, who is not a patriarchal
distortion of who we are or who we
are becoming.”

Women are also giving one
another a gift of insight, of bringing
to consciousness. ‘ ‘Everytime (poet
Adrienne) Rich writes something,'I
am impressed by the tremendous
leap of imagination. You can just .
see that for how ever long it has
been since the last (published)
thing. Her whole psychic conscious-
ness has taken a jump that is
exciting and interesting...For the
woman who doesn’t write but who
has an opportunity to read, you are

serving her, helping her take that
leap.” .

And this, Mallinger feels, is the
“job” of the writer——the stimula-
tion of new growth, new awareness.
She doesn’t believe that comes from
any mystical inspiration of the
poetic soul.

interesting countryroads and lanes.

Therefore,
teaching in a small town in Canada
with its small basis of Friends

from college before my senior year

and was working with the Friends’

Service Committee in Mexico in two
little villages when I met a couple.

Loaf, which is part of Middlebury
College in Vermont.

“I might at some point like to
return to New England. But, as I
said, I have two goals: to continue
writing and to be a good teacher.
And I’m going to be working on a
long narrative poem, which ‘will
probably constitute a whole book.”

‘ ‘I think of the women that I know
who could be taking these leaps, ” if
they didn’t have the four children or
did have decent child care. “Rich
says you dare not see yourself as the
special woman. You see yourself as
the lucky woman.”

Whenever discouragement sets
in about the oppression that still
plagues a woman" writer as well as
women in general, Mallinger recalls
a conversation with a friend in her
60s. This woman said only in the
last ﬁve years has she begun to feel
sane. Only after reading Kate
Millett’s “Sexual Politics” did she
ﬁnd conﬁrmation for her ideas and
perceptions about the plight of
women that she had always hidden
away as her secret “madness.”

The greatest accomplishment of
modern feminism is that “this time
we will never go back. This time we
have just come too far,” Mallinger
contends. ’

Too many exciting projects have
taken root and sprouted new
growth, Mallinger explains.

The feminist press has come from
little mimeosheets o_f polemics no
one else would print to quality
publications to which even well-
known authors now choose to
submittheir work.

The quality of thought by women
and how it is being listened to
excites her. _

The springing up of women
writers’ groups like the one at Pitt is
a hopeful sign, Mallinger ﬁnds.

‘ ‘There is a good feeling now that
there are other women to whom one
can turn. They are there for
support.’ ’ The walls of isolation are
tumbling now and the women are
there—as writers, as readers, as
publishers, as characters, as
supporters and as teachers.
