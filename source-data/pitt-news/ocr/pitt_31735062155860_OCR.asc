student referendum, SC has

decided to submit the Women Cheerleader question. to_ all
campus organizations, for consideration. SC representatives
at Monday’s ‘meeting heard chairman Paul Petro express
concern for the pre-semester vote. Voicing majority opinion
of his committee, Petro said that the referendum has been

criticized as being disorganized.

He felt that ﬁnal approval of
each campus group would substan-
tiate the large vote when 90 per
cent of Pitt students who voted
backed the proposal.

Granowitz Opposes Committee

Sam Granowitz opposed the
committee’s recommendation and
spoke out to send -the proposal di-
rectly to the administration. He
felt that the student vote was
enough; He said, “Nothing is go-
ing to happen in a positive way
unless the administration handles
it; and they won’t handle it until
it is ‘presented directly to them.”

The solons heard that T. W.
Biddle, dean of men, had ex-
pressed the desire to have the pro-
posal brought before WSGA.

Though she later voted to send

tration, WSGA prexy Pat Ritz de-
fended the women’s organization
against a recent editorial in the
Pitt News which stated, “WSGA

completely ignored the issue at its V

they will vote on the SC plan.”
Miss Ritz said “WSGA is aware
of the women cheerleader prob-

By JUDY GOTTERER

Far East to America makes an un-
derstanding of it vital to today’s
citizens, said Dr. James T. C. Liu,
sponsor of the new interdepart-
ental ’major in Far Eastern
Studies. Of the 2,000.colleges in
the United States, only approx-
imately ﬁve of them have insti-
tuted such a major in their curric-
ulum, with Pitt leading these col-
leges in enrollment.

This new major prepares the
student for better chances in mil-
itary pervices and officer training
schools, for civilian agencies of the
federal government, for mission-
ary, educational and business

in biophysics and for specialty
studies in graduate school.

Owing to the war, few business
opportunities are available at the
present time. With the advent of
peace, however, graduates may be
employed by private companies or
banks in the airline, boat or ex-
port business.

The program’s aim is to enable
students to know the ‘cultures of
China, Japan and Korea with spe-
cial emphasis on China. Studies
will also be made of adjoining
areas: Southeast Asia, India, Cen-
tral Asia, and Eastern Siberia.

In addition Chinese language in-
struction began this semester.

Last September the Far Eastern
departmental program began with
eight students, and within six
months, the enrollment has ‘grown
to :13.

“I would like to express my ap-
preciation of student response to
the program.” Dr. Liu added, “Of
course we need the help of depart-

' ments, but student interest is the

SC Looks to Women

Apparently the SC members de-
cided to give WSGA the opportu-
nity to place the proposal on their
agenda when they voted down

the cheerleader plan directly to
administration for consideration.

Following through with the
original committee plan Paul Petro
announced that _ letters would be
sent to all campus organizations
this week. Response would be due
back at the dean of men’s office

UNDERSTANDING VITAL-
Shown above is Dr. James T. C.
Liu, sponsor of the new inter-
departmental major in F ar
Eastern Studies. Pitt is one of
the handful of schools in the

deciding factor for success. If stu-
dents are interested in it, and
want it, they willmake it grow.

“Too many students come to
takewhat is given and not to take
an active role in learning what
they want to know. Growth of the
program depends on the quality
as well as the _number of. students.
It is the student who makes the
University.”

The next goal for the program,
said Dr. Liu, is not to grow in
size, for it has already grown in
enrollment, but to grow in qual-
ity. “W_e-consider our students a
selective group preparing for spe-
cial careers. We hope to do a good
job with them.”

There is nograduate school in

the next three years, he hopes to
build up the program‘ on the grad-
uate level.

The program has the coopera-
tion of ﬁne arts, geography, his-
tory, political science and sociol-
ogy departments. Dr. Liu express-
ed his hope that with expansion

.of the program, more departments

will take an active part in its fu-
ture.

“It is not my program, nor the
dean’s, nor the department’s,” he
explained, “but a program where
the student and the University are
partners.” . -

" Dr. Liu received his college edu-
cation in China, where he did
government work in history. He
has taught at several universities
in ‘Peking, principally at Yench-
ing University.

As the Chinese Historial Con-

sultant, Dr. Liu was attched to A

He was a research associate at
the Far Eastern and Russian In-
stitute, University of Washington

in Seattle and an instructor at E

Yale. He received his Ph.D. at Pitt
and returned here to teach both
Far Eastern and Russian History.

St. Patrick as
Patronxsaint

St. Patrick, the patron saint of
engineers, is set to storm the Ca-
thedral of Learning Mar. 17 to
"disprove the story concerning a
piece of the blarney stone that is
housed in the Irish Nationality
Room. The good saint will also be
present to crown»S_t. Patricia at
the Shamrock Ball dance of the
E -& M Association on Friday,
Mar. 19.

The dance, an informal affair,‘
will be the culminating event of a
‘full week of activities aimed at
emphasizing the role of engineers
at the University.

The Pitt Engineers, who will be
the Engineering School farthest
east to ever have such a week at
this time of the year, have theor-
ized that St. Patrick was the ﬁrst
engineer, since he drove the

snakes out of Ireland, thus creat-'

ing the ﬁrst “worm drive.”

Also, a manuscript has suppos-
edly been found with the words
‘,‘.Erin Go Bragh”_ inscribed in St.
Pat’s hand. According -to the en-
gineers, this can be liberally trans-

lated to read “St. Patrick was an

engineer.”

Other events planned for the
first engineering week at Pitt are
a high school open house on
Thursday, Mar. 18 and an open
house for parents and friends on
the same evening.

There will also be a special
chapel service held for the en-
gineers and Chaplain Luccock will
make his topic, “St. Patrick: the
Patron Saint of Engineers.”

The iron gate in the Commons
Room is one of thelast works of
Samuel Yellin, considered the
greatest craftsman in handwrought
iron since the Renaissance.

Next Monday is the annual‘ Rose Tea at which the
~-nominees for Senior Queen will be‘ announced.~ Between
“ﬁve and seven senior girls will be tapped out of a class of

--approximately 250 women. The select few will be chosen

for intangible qualities of character, personality, contri-
'bution to University life, and beauty of spirit. Nowhere is
physical beauty or attractiveness allowed to creep into the
picture. The other criteria are better. Maybe they are
better but they are certainly more diﬁicult to discern and
evaluate and more likely to be inﬂuenced by popularity

‘ and personal favor.

Is it fairto select a few girls. out of -so many on such
a basis? They deserve the honor, but does that mean-that
the others do not possess these qualities? It is too difficult
to judge on this basis and the feelings are too susceptible

if the selections are not agreeable to a majority, which 1

they seldom are. It is impossible to select ﬁve or ‘seven
women for such idealistic and intangible qualities from 250
women who have ‘experienced the same training and in-
doctrination. ‘ V .

. Then there is the coronation ceremony for the coed
selected from these few:nominees who most nearly “typi-
ﬁes the ideal of what a woman graduate of the University
should be.” Is it fair to endow a girl with such idealistic
qualities? It can be argued that there should be no such
ultimate selection‘ since it is said that the queen represents
a1l‘other senior girls, and they crown themselves at the
same time. It is paradoxal to single out one woman as the
ideal and then say she represents all other women. _

There is certainly to be a goal of glory in the selection
also. The velvet hat and fur-trimmed cape are ‘coveted by
some as the ultimate achievement and when they receive the
golden scepter there will be a baseness and hollowness to
their triumph. There will also be bitterness and tears on
the part of the women who strove earnestly tq typify these
ideals that are so nebulous and were ﬁnally crushed when
the rose was passed to the next person instead. Then too,
it is easy to become _intangled in the alluring appeal ‘of ac-
tivities and neglect‘ the studies that must be maintained at
least to the C plus average. _

Perhaps the crowning blow is the British-aped corona-
tion itself-—rather out of place in a republican Democracy.
To coin a phrase,_“it’s as out of place as a bear in a bassinet.”
The pomp and splendor may be ﬁne and soul-stirring but
deliver us from the wasteful extravagance of a coronation.
Even the British felt the ﬁnancial bitterness creeping into
the ceremony that to them is practically their whole sym-
bol of governmental power. »

Is the expense, the bitterness, the tears, the. hurt, the
frailty, and the dependence on antiquated tradition worth
the satisfying of a whim and the ﬂeetingimoment of glory
‘for one coed who is, after all, a coed———not a queen.

Far be it from me to advocate anarchy among

"the “students, but it seems time for someone to

take some sort_ of action on this women cheer-
lead.er question. i T I s

The problem of whether or not to have women

cheerleaders has been kicking around Pitt longer

than some members of the administration, but
the answer has always been the
same—no women, no cheers‘, no
nothing. Right now the rather
befuddled members of Student
Congress are trying to decide
how to get some sort of action,
but the best they could do Mon-
day was to-pass a resolution
which will send the women
‘cheerleader question to campus
organizations. What this will ac- B

 

complish, outside of giving these organizations an ‘
excuse for their weekly meeting, I‘don’t know.

A Vote Is A Vote ' .

'4 These meetings will all run along the same
line, though. The Newman Club will unhesitantly
give the issue to its “Committee in Charge of

Studying Questionable Material, Magazines, or
Morals,”) and WSGA will look to the front ofﬁce
to get an official shake of the head. The mem-
bers of other groups will stumble over themselves
in an effort to get in their slobbering “Yes!’? votes
and in asfew weeks SC will happily tabulate the
results and duly report that the majority of the
organizations are in favor of women cheerleaders.

After this,SC will present the resolution to the
administration, assuming of course that SC doesn’t
think of another way of testing student opinion.
Maybe SC could let the students vote on the method
to be used to present the question formally to the
administration. I know some students who‘ think
the question should be engraved while another fac-

" " . . . Thy Name is Woman"

 

tion" favors the use of a two—cent post card. A
third, and somewhat smaller group believes that
news of this magnitude should be sent via Western
Union. (Day rate collect.) I
Conservative Estimate —, .

, Conservatively speaking, it will be near the.end
of March before the administration opens its of-
ﬁcial eyes to the fact that the majority of students
want .women ‘cheerleaders. Just as conservatively
speaking, it ‘ will be well into. April before the

-administration officially announces that the mati-
ter has been taken under consideration and will‘

be referred to the proper committee.
That could be the end of it, but it doesn’t have

‘ to be if the students push for some type of ac-

tion. An all-out "strike is as little drastic for this
sort of thing, and no one would even notice a
sitdown strike in the Tuckshops, but with a little
thought we could probably come up with some
milder forms of needling designed to produce ac-

. tion.

The Endowed and Allowed

-The girls who ‘are allowed and the girls’ who
are endowed could wear sweaters and short skirts
to school, while‘ those with knobby knees could
wear long skirts and carry‘ banners beseeching, the
administration to hurry up give an answerto the
by-now gray—bearded women cheerleader ques-

.tion. (The question would be gray-bearded, not ‘

the cheerleaders.) A

' The men wouldn’t bewleft out of this campaign,
either. "A torchlight parade never hurt any cause

and if the men would act as a group they could M‘
import a sample cheerleader from another uni-

versity to add to the unrest. Frankly, if everyone
is as receptive to the idea as Dean Biddle seems
to be there won’t be any need for action of this
sort. "

I’m afraid, though, that the administration will
react like everyone else-——it,would be a nice exe-
cution if someone would only pull the switch.

driver. The most recent example
of this debatable saying took
place on the Merritt Parkway
last week when a stalled mo-
torist hailed a passing car for
aid. Alas for

' him, it was
one of those
most intrepid
o p e r ators {of

Said stalled
motorist to the
would-be good
s a m a r i t an,
“My car is a
hydra-matic so _
you’ll have to get going about 35

or 40 miles an hour before it will

start.” Then, with no qualms or
misgivings, he assumed his po-
sition behind the wheel. His po-
sition was somewhat altered
however when our “femine fatle”
sailed into the rear end of his
car at a speed of 37.5 miles per
hour. What did he expect with
such skimpy directions?

Religions Week

Editor.
The Pitt News:

I would like to thank sincerely
the administration, the faculty,
and the students at Pitt for their
support and participation in our
recent Religion-In-Life program.

Such a program could not be
effective without long "hours of
preparation. The enthusiasm and
effort of the Executive Commit-
tee, the Council, the committee
workers and the Advisors were
encouraging.

I

 

. O1‘ 3 woman ..

 

I am also indeed grateful to the

  

old style method. And there are

still a few women who drive
them. Whether it be laziness or
ignorance, ' a goodly percentage
of these women never seem to
get out of second gear.

Now, this tendency to clutch at
second gear as if it were the only
port in a storm, would be per-
fectly in order if the car hap-
pened to be climbing or descend-
ing a steep grade. But such is
not usually the case. One may
observe this phenomenon by
standing. in the middle of the
block and waiting’ for a woman
to drive by at a speed of 40 or 45
miles per hour-—in second gear.
If asked why she is in second
gear she is apt to reply, “It
wouldn't go any faster in ﬁrst.”

Parking Poses Problem

Parking admittedly is oft times
a tricky proposition. And yet, it
is hard to understand a woman’s
view point with regard to this
subject. Our woman driver will
cruise the block until she ﬁnds
a slot long enough to hold the
Twentieth Century Limited and
then take her stand somewhere
in the same block preparatory to
backing in.

At this point, she will do one
of three things. She may stall her
car. She may put it in second
gear and park on someone’s front
porch. And lastly, she may ac-
tually back up, although whether

or not she will back into the
space is purely inpthe realm of

, probability.

At any rate, once she is parked,
and has hiked from her car to
the curb, she will trip over the
ﬁre. plug.

Then, there is the question of "

hand signals. It was sincerely
hoped that the advent of auto-
matic turn signals would elimi-
nate error in hand signals but
alas . .” . ’ *

Women Understand

Women seem to have a dia-
bolical aptitude for applying
other necessities of life to driv-
ing. The classic is, of course, the
drying of one’s nail polish. This
task, when accomplished by.ex-
tending the hand out the window
of the car, sometimes confuses
following motorists. If the car
behind is also driven by a wom-
an, she will understand and
probably pass out ﬁnger nail
dryer as soon as the sidewalk is
unobstructed.

If, however, the motorist be-
hind happens to be a man, he is
apt to be foolish enough to as-
sume that she is signaling for a
turn, either to right or left, or
that she may soon come to a
complete stop.

It has been said that when a
woman extends her arm from a
car window only one thing is
certain. The window is open.

Chairman Expresses Thanks

Pitt News for the coverage af-

the thoughtful and penetrating
articles by the editorial staff.
If.in some small way Pitt stu-
dents have become aware of the
challenging forces of the world
struggle and have sought to
“face up” to the problems in
light of their religious and philo-
sophic perspectives, Religion-In-

To Interview Graduates About Exceptional Employment
Opportunities A--Check With Your Placement Bureau!

 

At Wright Aeronautical Division of Curtiss-Wright
Corporation, young engineers have a broad ﬁeld

in which to develop their talents and win good career
jobs. Here is a permanent center of research and
development — an essential part of

Amcric_a’s industrial and defense structure.

We are concerned primarily with development

and production of reciprocating and jet

engines and development of turboprops and ramjets.
But the vast pool of engineering specialists who
work on these long-term projects is engaged

in activities in many ﬁelds other than aviation.
There is a continuing search for new materials,

new ‘techniques and processes, new products

evensome consumer goods.

We have many career opportunities for ambitious
young men. There’s room here to advance and win
recognition and rewards. Our “on the job” training

will put you on the right road to success.

March may have brought rain, snow, hail and sleet,

but for Pitt footballers it added something else—spring grid

drills. °

Head Coach Lowell “Red” Daw- ‘
son announced that the Panthers
take to Trees Field starting Mar.
28, weather permitting.

According to NCA ’\ rules, Daw-
son will be al-  .

period. And, the
h ea d mentor
will be quite
anxious to get

    

the short term
since this will
first
chance to include the promising
freshman crop in his varsity.
Grunder, Tunning Enlisting
With ~single platoon football
here to stay, at least for a while,
the Panthers will not have the
complete rebuilding job that con-
fronted themlast year.

Meanwhile, Dawson received
notice this week from two mem-
bers of last season’s team, guard
Rudy Grunder and tackle Glenn
Tunning, that they will not re-
turnto school.

The two sophomore linemen
from Massilon, 0., wrote that they
have left to enter the service.
Dawson had counted on Grunder
as one of the top, candidates at
guard while Tunning was expect-
ed to help out at tackle.

Operation for Mattioli

Junior Paul Blanda has also
dropped out of the school this se-
mester but as far as the Young-
wood native’s plans are concerned
no one sems to know.

Otherwise, Dawson will have the
full squad in action the ﬁnal week
in March. Quarterback Rudy Mat-
tioli recently underwent a knee
operation but is expected to don
a uniform by the end of the
month.

Dawson was very satisfied with
the team’s showing this ‘past
semester in grades. His remark
that “the mortality rate is decreas-
ing" is backed up by statistics
that show only two freshmen grid-
ders meeting scholastic difficulties.

Fifth in IC4A;

Six thinclads which Coach Carl
Olson entered in the LC4A indoor
track meet in Madison Square
Garden managed to ﬁnish in a
ﬁfth-place tie with Columbia, with
eleven -‘points last Saturday.

Wally Monahan led the Pan-
thers by placing second in the 60-
yard high hurdles. The two mile
relay team of Dan Sornmer, Don
Delligatti, Chuck Fritz, and Arnie
Sowell also gained a second. _

Don Minihan’s 13-feet, 6-inch
effort earned him third place in
the pole vault.

The Olsonmen will compete in
the Milwaukee Journal meet next
week, and then the K of C in Co-
lumbus later.

Largest Crowd
Last year’s national and eastern
titlist, the Lions were no competi-
tion.for the ﬁred-up Panthers Sat-
urday night before a more than
capacity audience of 6000 at State

 College.

' But Statewas without the serv-
ices of three of their top wrestlers
against Pitt, so Charlie Speidel can
argue that his matmen should
show much better in the playoffs.

Peery will not debate this question

-—he knows the next one will tell
the ﬁnal score. . -

For the time being, however,
this victory was the biggest for the
Panthers in their ﬁve years of ex-
istence. Nittany fans sat stunned
and amazed as their bitterest rival,
Pitt, took all but two matches,
posting a season’s record of 9-1.

Peery’s 40th Straight
Hugh Peery, the Blue and Gold’s
most honored athlete and NCAA

ghamp, started the battle off with
his 40th straight win by pinning

Bill Cramp. As everyone in the

arena knew, Cramp’s job was just

not to get pinned, but Peery knew
his job and ﬁnally -felled Cramp
with one minute remaining.

Carnegie’s Bill Kozy continued
the Panther brigade by easily de-
,cisioning Hal Byers in the 130-
pound class by a 8-0 score.

Next came one of the best tus-
sles of the evening as senior
George Matthews from Munhall
lost a tough 4-2 decision to one of
the nation’s best, Dick Lemyre.

Three Jlinchers

Senior Charley Uram~ brought
the Panthers back into the tally
column with a close 2-1 conquest
of Doug Frey in the 147 -pound di-
vision. Soph Ed DeWitt then
pushed the Lions out of contention
with his pinning of Bill Krebs, and
Joe Solomon made sure the Pan-
thers would win by besting Bill
Shawley in the 167 class.

Sophomore George
completed the Pitt rout with a 5-1
decision over Olympic alternate
Joe Krufa in the 177 weight event.
Panther heavyweight Harold Hun-
ter was pinned by Bill Oberly after

battling on even terms throughout -

most his match.

Following the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Wrestling tourney next
week, Peery will escort his squad
west in a bid for national honors.

Peery’s home state, Oklahoma,
will be the scene of this year’s
NCAA tournament- Last season
Penn State won the team cham-
pionship, but after their two losses
this campaign, stock in the Nit-
tainies has dropped considerably.

Covies in Final

By GENE AROMATORIO

Pitt’s freshman cage quintet,
under the ﬁrst-year head coaching
of Carl Peterson, ﬁnished out the
hoop season in ﬁne fashion last
Saturday
Geneva’s frosh ﬁve, 84-68.

Leading the scoring was 6-4 for-
ward John Riser with 30 points.
Following Riser were Bob Show
with 18 and Bob Lazor with 15.

“ Geneva’s 6-0 jump short artist,
John Swbgger, led his teammates
with 18 points.

Shaky Start

Geneva had previously upset
the Panthers, 83-71, to be one of
three teams to turn the trick this
season-—West ,,,Virginia and Du-
quesne being the others.

West Virginia’s Mountaineers
turned the trick twice by way of
an 85-84 victory at Morgantown
and a 106-85 crushing at the Field
House in the return engagement.

After a shaky start Coach Pe-
terson lit a ﬁre under his boys
and they started to move.

Streak Short-Lived

Following two straight defeats
the Jungle Cats bounced back with
two quick victories.

At this time Peterson and his
men were introduced to Hot Rod
Hundley and the WVU frosh. Pe-
terson brought his crew home, los-
ers in an 85-84 thriller-—Hundley
32. -

Again the Panthers hit the win-
ning trail by mauling W & J and
nosing out Westminster. This win-
ning streak also was short—lived
-—Hundley again saw to that as the
Mounties won, 106-85, with Hund-
ley sinking 46. 9

High Game Average

Shaking oﬁ the effects of this
defeat, the Peterson machine met
Westminster for the second time
and won again, 74-70, following

night by humbling _

5 Pitt’s 1953-54 version of hoop-

sters started slow but ended well.
In their last 14 contests, the cagers
won eight to complete theryear
with a 9-14 slate. *

The ﬁnal win came Saturday
night at the Field House when
Bob Timmons’ proteges slapped
Geneva, 84-75, to end on a ﬁweet
note and avenge a previous defeat.

Just as he had all season long,
Dutch Burch was the Panther top
scorer in the final averages. The
shotmaking as well as playmaking
guard tallied 363 times for an
average of 15.8.

Junior forward Ed Pavlick, who
trailed throughout the campaign,
came up with a ﬂourish but still
was second with 3-08 markers for
a 13.4 average. -

Gymnasts Face

Veteran OSU

Hopes for their ﬁrst victory of
the season appear even slimmer
this week for Pitt’s ﬁrst-year gym-
nastic team, for this Saturday
Coach Warren Neiger’s squad must
travel to Ohio State to take on the
experienced Buckeyes.

Last Saturday the Panthers
came within ﬁve points of the ob-
staclé as they were edged out by
West Virginia, 501/2-451/2, at the
Field House. The slim margin re-
veals’ how rapidly they are im-
proving, as compared with an

earlier 59-37 loss to the Mountain-

eers.

The recordnow stands at 0-3,
with two more meets remaining on
the schedule——OSU and Illinois.

Ted Strauss took the only ﬁrst
place for Pitt against -WVU, in the
parallel bars. The other events:
in horizontal bars
and rings; Bob_ Kennedy, second
in tumbling; and John Petrakes,
second in side horse.

Newmans Win Third Straight . F
Trouncing Arnold Air, 50-31

By BERNARD MORRIS .' .

The Newman Club swept their third straight league tri-
umph by trouncing the Arnold Air Society -ﬁve, 50-21,

in an

IM game played at the Stadium=

Monday. 4

The victors were paced by lanky
Bernie Eisen, who tallied 19
points, most of them in the fourth
quarter when the Newman’s pull-
ed far out in front.

Both teams were cold in the ﬁrst
quarter and the stanza ended with

the score Newman Club 13, Arnold _

Air, 9. Eisen’s rebounding was out-
standing, as time after‘ time he
went high in the air to gain con-
trol of the ball. _

Dick Gatz, a one—hand push
shot artist, took charge in the sec-
ond period by hitting on three
straight outside shots which pull-
ed Newmans to a 22-16 halftime
lead.

,Wilber McKnight led the air-
men in the second half, but it was
all in vain as his teamates failed
to accord him any support.

The Newman quintet really got
hot in the fourth quarter, opening
up a huge gap. Eisen and Bob
Wrabley hit from all angles and
Arnold was unable to cope with
either. Arnold was just as cold as
their opponents were hot and shot

off. ‘ P
‘ The victors were led by Eisen,

that with a 77-68 triumph over ’

Carnegie Tech.

In posting an 8-4 record the
Panthers scored 937 points for a
78 per game average while al-
lowing 8.32 points to the opposi-
tion for a 69 per game average.
