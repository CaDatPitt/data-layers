mP0svar Meets with BAS Toclay OD! Okays Guidelines L

(For Annex Music Shows

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar will
meet informally with a delegation
of black students today who plan to
explain to him why Curtiss Porter
should be named chairman of the

* black studies department instead
of the administration’s designate
Dr. Roland Smith.
The meeting", which will be held at
the offices of the Black Action
 Society [BAS], is a result of a
I protest Tuesday when more than
100 black students, faculty mem-
bers, and community leaders
jammed the Chancellor’s small
-reception office and confronted Pitt_
officials for four hours. Posvar was
not in Pittsburgh at the time.

 Softens Harcllinei
‘A On Shapp at Pitt

. BY CONNIE GIEL

Republican gubernatorial candi-

 date Drew Lewis, softened his
earlier hard-line attack on corrup-
tion in the Shapp administration in

, an appearance at Pitt, Wednesday,
but maintained the “underlying
issue in this campaign will be the
honesty and integrity of those
running for public office."

While denying corruption is, in-
deed, an issue, Lewis said, “The
problem in the Shapp administra-
tion is not so much the fact that
corruption existed, but that once he
found_out about it he tolerated it.

“We need a governor who sur-
rounds himself with people of

Q ability and integrity. 1 have not
ti’ campaigned on the issue of corrup-
/ tion in the Shapp administration
but I do ‘feel he has surrounded
himself with people who can't do

should receive the post because of‘
his experience in the department--

he was one of the founders in

1969--and more importantly, that

he has overwhelming support from

black students, Black Studies

faculty members, the community,

and the recommendation of a

search committee.

Both the administration and BAS
officials agree no decisions will be
made at today's discussion, and it
will be informal, unlike the tense
confrontation earlier this week.

“The Chancellor is going to the

‘meeting primarily ‘to listen,”

explained executive assistant to the
Chancellor Ray Coble, “And he
will _make a response once he‘
evaluates and considers the prob-
lems involved.” ‘

Neither BAS Chairperson Graylyn
Swilley nor Coble would speculate
on the possible resolution of the
conflict. Bu’t Swilley has said
publicly black students will fight
for the right of self-determination--
in this case to have Porter named
chairman of Black Studies--and will
not stop struggling until it is
attained. -

Swilley called attention to a"
provision of an agreement made
ﬁve yearstago after black students
staged a sit-in at Pitt’s computer
center until certain demands were
met, one of which was the
establishment of the black studies
department.

The agreement reads: '

“Members of the Black Action

‘Society will study the University’s

structure to determine where black
administrators, faculty, and other
personnel are needed and will

recommend to the University"

where such personnel should be
placed.” '
It also says the Chancellor will
arrange for meetings with BAS
concerning the recruitment of such
personnel. But\Swilley maintains
this agreement has not been kept.-
“We are going to let the
Chancellor know where we are,”

Pitt-CMU Faculty Panel “

Favors Home Rule Plan

BY BILL MOORE

The controversial Pittsburgh
,5» Home Rule Charter was the topic of
a panel discussion held Tuesday
evening by seven Pitt and CMU
faculty members with the majority
advocating passage of the Charter
,, proposal despite its alleged weak-
 nesses. 4 - ' . ,

    

Cha1jter’s passage would affect the
individual citizen and meet the
citizen’s needs.

Pitt Urban Studies Director
Samuel P. Hays called for citi'zens
to vote for the bill in November.

eventually named, Swilley replied,
“Only time will tell.”

“Limited musical events and cof- _

feehouses" will once again be
permitted in the Student Union
Annex under new (guidelines
agreed on by the Qakland Develop-
ment Inc. (ODI) two-block commit-
tee and the Student Government
Board (SGB).

The guidelines, pending Univer-
sity approval, allow resumption of
programs halted in late September
due to controversy over the “un-
ruly crowds” creating problems in
the Annex area. '

ODl two-block committee mem-
bers agreed Thursday evening that
strict; enforcement of guidelines

submitted by SGB members would‘

alleviate the problems.

The “limited musical events and
coffeehouses" allowed by the
guidelines were termed by SGB
president Mike Furick “not really
concerts. Programs with the kind of
atmosphere where students sit

down. listen, andtalk with their _

friends."

Schweiker vs. Flaherty, “

US A Senatorial Contest

BY KEN GORMLEY

Probably the most c-losely-
watched election race in Pennsyl-
vania is the heated rivalry between
incumbent State Senator Richard
Schweiker (R) and Pittsburgh
Mayor, Democrat Pete Flaherty. '

Even among the many issues on
which Flaherty and Schweiker
seem to have taken similar stands,
the twocandidates are quick to
point out differences.

Flaherty maintains he has always.

opposed compulsory busing of
school children. ‘‘It is counterpro-
ductive. The quality of education
can be improved more throughthe
neighborhood school system.” But
the Mayor claims Schweiker, who
now states “I’ve generally been
opposed to this,” supported de-
segregation by busing until a few
weeks ago.

And altheugh both candidates‘

advocate campaign reforms and
claim to have run ine pensive
campaigns, Schweiker told news-
men in Pittsburgh two days ago,
“The Mayor has not reported some
$26,000 -in contributions under
$100. But we have listed every

 isiliebtical. of the

Senator’s honesty in campaign
tactics. Asked if he was scared by
the Senator’s recent report that a
poll indicated he [Schweiker] was

‘ making substantial gains over his

opponent in Pittsburgh and all over

the State, F laherty responded,

“No. It’s a lot of propaganda.”

inflation will have to be combatted
through other means. “Tax loop-

proposed a bill designed to close
them, but Nixon vetoed it."
Schweiker went on to say he will do

his best to see this legislation gets‘

through, now.

Flaherty was" also opposed to the
surcharge on the grounds it was
“an unjust burden on the middle-
come taxpayer." He saw several
other methods for fighting infla-
tion. “I don't think President Ford
has taken any meaningful steps to
combat inﬂation. We have to cut
down on big government spending.
We have to break up oil monopolies
which are freezing out competition.
We must also stop price fixing
which is a major cause of inflation.

“will not pay much attention to the

The guidelines also call for two
campus police officers and six
student programming marshalls

,within the Annex during program-

ming events.

“Programming marshalls are cer-
tain students distributed around
the Annex. IF there are any major
problems they ‘call in the campus
police. We feel if a student asks
another to quiet_ down there is less
danger of a student becoming

Governor Hopeful Lewis H

(Continued from Page I)
the proper job in’ terms of repre-
senting the people of Pennsylvan-
ia,” Lewis said.

He asserted as his “single great-
es_t quality" the ability to “get
people going in the same direct-
ion."

Lewis’ opening statements pre-
faced a question and answer period
in which several students protested
the alleged “smear tactics” in the
Lewis campaign. Lewis avoided a
specific rebuttal and insisted,
“What we -really need in ’74 state
government, lacking in both this
administrations and also in the last
two years of Ray Shafer’s, is
someone who can work with the
General Assembly in harmony to_
get things done.

Governor Shapp can’t get along
with the legislature. David Lawr-
en'ce (Democrat) and" Bill Scranton
(Republican) both had legislative
success, so you’ don't necessarily
need party control for a governor to
get along with the rest of the
government." ‘ «
_The students expressed dissatis-
faction with Lewis’ reply but the 43
year old candidate did not raise the
-matter again. ’

Lewis periodically emphasized
what he considered the major
issue. “There’s no question that
the key issue is spending and the
high cost of government, and the
fact that during the last four years
my opponent has almost doubled
the cost of state government while
at the same time the services from
that government have gone down-
hill,” Lewis said.

To hear position

Lewis outlined his relief program
for the middle income families,
whom he considers the hardest hit
by Shapp’s policies. ’

“What's happened is the econ-
omically disadvantaged and the
wealthy can afford a college educa-
tion but the middle income families
who pay the taxes cannot. We
should start shifting the emphasis,
let's say, from welfare into in-
creased aid forhigher education.”

He suggested increasing by "/3 the
contribution toward college costs
from the family, and increasing
scholarship aid also by 2/3, a
proposal which would cost the stated
$10 million, according to Lewis.

Lewis proposed a “Pennsylvania
Partnership Plan"' in which each
politically intact unit would have an
ombudsman.

“State government is too far from
the people because politicians tend
to surround themselves with their
palace guard and the net result is
that‘ they don’t know what's going
on." V - .
Lewis attacked Governor Shapp’s
taxation policy and advocated a ﬂat
2%, income tax_ over the Shapp
preferred graduated income tax.
“The graduated income tax is the
most inequitable and not all all
progressive. It kills the middle
income people, with all ,,its loop-
holes,” said Lewis. He,favors a ﬂat
tax with exemptions for the lower
income levels. Lewis admitted this

policy has little likelihood of being H

implemented, and said, ‘fl would
support )a modified graduated in-
come tax that belneﬁtted only thpse

1 who have to pay it.”

‘to the Charter,

 

, .

/

(Continued from Page 1)
present Charter is a step in the
right direction, it now depends on
who uses it and in what way.”

Ray Owen, —-from Pitt Political
Science Department pointed out
the “potentially good Community
Advisory Boards" and argued for
the Charter’s passage citing
“checks and balances, program
audits, and other worthy improve-
ments.” . -

CMU History Department Faculty
member Dan Resnick said he was
also for passage. “Representation
is the key in this charter. We ought
not be looking to reverse ourselves
to district representation, we
should be concerned with at-large
representation, and‘we should try
to make it work better.”

He called for better’ media
coverage of city government to
improve citizen_understanding.
“We should see 1, more citizen
participation if the media takes
seriously an attempt to carry what

‘is happening in the city to the

people."

Discussing his general reactions
Pitt English
Department Faculty member Dan
Tannacito said “the conclusion I’ve
come to‘is that the Charter sends
out this message--government in
Pittsburgh should be cleaned up,
but not changed--this ’differs
greatly from the first draft of the ,
Charter.”

The present Charter proposal is
the result of two years of
investigation by a city Government
Study "Commission.

All discussion wasn’t rosey,

Posvor Meets with BAS Today

(Continued from Page 1)

The BAS held an informational
rally .Wednesday to explain to
interested students the events of
the past week, and also the history
of the black studies department at
Pitt. ‘

Porter, who has sought the post
since Jack Daniel--another founder
of the department--resigned in
1973 to accept an internship at
Stanford, spoke to approximately
100 black students after receiving a
warm standing ovation.

He praised the students for
“acting more intelligently and
sophisticated” than he had during
the struggle in 1969 when Porter
was involved in the effort to
establish a black studies depart-
ment at Pitt.

Concerning Dean Jerome ,A.
Rosenberg, who made the decision
to appoint Smith, a Carnegie
Mellon University professor, Porter
said “If I was the Chancellor. I

berg should have considered to a
de‘gree the attitudes of black
students, faculty, and community.

Other speakers at the rally
commended the students for acting
rationally, and intelligently, and for
their willingness to sit down with

’administrators and work out a

solution to the conflict.
In an interview yesterday after-
noon, Coble without speculating on

Porter's qualiﬁcations, hypothes-

The absence of by-district council
elections caused disagreement
between Cooper and other discus-
sion participants.

“While the -Charter may be a

M slight improvement”, Cooper said,
‘‘If we do settle for this Charter, '

there is no hope at all that city
council will decide, as the Charter
gives them to right to do,_ to alter
election procedures and ' have
district elections." ~

Cooper said ‘he personally would
advocate rejection of the proposal
on those grounds and expressed
hopes , a new study commission
would propose a more suitable
Charter-.

“There is nothing in the charter

ehe‘ stereotype of any American university is that it is an institution of
eigher learning distinguished by intellectual, rational, and logical
tltdught. The recent controversy over the selection of a Black Studies
gehairman and the resulting protest on Tuesday conflicts with that
ereotype. I '
roughout this ordeal, now more than a month old, the Pitt
" ministration should have been most concerned with avoiding an
_ dent such as the one which unfortunately occurred in the

 

bugh it first became apparent _ in late September that Pitt
administrators were opposed to the selection of Curtiss Porter.
'1. ointrary to an agreement reached with the Black Action Society (BAS)
n 1969 the administration did not seek student involvementin what the
ministration should have realized was a tedious and grave matter for
those concerned with the future of the black studies department.
Luring the month_’s delay BAS representatives initiated~a series of
eetings with Chancellor Posvar,‘ Provost Rhoten Smith, and Faculty
9 '«Arts and Sciences (FAS) Dean Jerome Rosenberg in an attempt to
 input into the decision making‘ processes relative to the
’pointment of a Black Studies chairperson. At those meetings
students made known their preference‘for'Curtiss Porter as the best
ndidate. .
_ his issue had gained wide coverage over the past month in both the
't-'t News and the University Times. In two previous editorials on this
jubject the Pitt News stated Porter seemed to be the only choice for the

get, Executive Assistant tb the Chancellor Ray Coble said during
Tuesday’s protest he was surprised by this sign of student activism and
‘ad not expected the students’ concern on this issue.

 his indicates quite clearly that Pitt administrators are out.of touch
with reality. Had the administration sought the opinion of the many
involved students, as it had a moral responsibility to do, they would
‘ave been aware of what Coble labels .student activism. ' BAS
representatives sought to inform the administration of the gravity of
-his matter, but that opinion was either disregarded totally or it was not
_,_enjheard. The student activism Coble refers to was not only
manifested Tuesday, but has been expressed within the last month
both adequately and through the proper non-disruptive channels.
"Given that Smith was selected over Porter, given that the
fministration was baffled by student reaction to the selection, and
given that Pitt administrators abhorrently neglected their
‘sponsibility’ by ‘not initiating meetings with concerned students as
andated by the agreement reached in 1969 we must question, then,
}what degree if any did the administration take into account student
ncern, when it selected a Black Studies chairman. And, also, to what
xtent were the selection processes, thus, appropriate and legitimate.

 Self Determination

As well as serving the needs of the black community, the black studies
epartment ‘is an integral part of the academic structure at Pitt. The
/ncern, then, of total self-determination in matters involving the black
studies department expressed by BAS representatives is without
erit.

Students, like faculty, should not have ‘veto authority over’ an
ministrative decision, and the agreement reached five years ago did
'not imply that students had this right.

As the Pitt News said in an earlier editorial we do not pretend to be
_g,ualiﬁed to sit in judgment of Curtiss Porter in comparison to the
edentials of other prospective candidates. Only the administration.
;this time, has the necessary information to make that decision. and
:_e,'admin.istration’s ability aitd authority to make those decisions vital
 the ' academic well-being of the institution, including the

ppointment of black studies department chairman, must be

cognized. -

However, this should not be a guise for the deliberate disregard of
;s_t_udent opinion. Students have a right and an obligation to voice their
pinions in such matters, and an administrator who is not conscious of
 concern is ignoring his responsibility. But, under no

niversity policy. . I .

Pitt administrators are not untouchable and have an obligation to
pcount for their decisions. And this issue is the most tragic aspect of
his controversy.

Candor and Logic

The voice of reason, however. must now prevail.

The decision ' by

Rosenberg on Tuesday to reassess his position on the question of-a
Black Studies chairman possiblv avoided a more serious incident which
could have shamed Pitt last Tuesday.

If Pitt administrators, especially the FAS Dean, the Provost, and the
Chancellor, when reassessing the situation now with the added factor
of student activism in support of Porter, are convinced that Roland
Smith is the most qualified person available to head the department,

the decision should not be reversed.

However, if that is to be the case, we must state as we did a month

the administration has a

responsibility to state clearly,

unequivocally, and specifically the reasons for Porter's rejection.
Pitt administrators, namely Rosenberg and Rhoten Smith have said
this is not a matter to'be discussed publicly. And it was this blatantly
intolerable lack of candor which forced Tuesday's confrontation.
Anything less than a solid explanation only would incite more protests

and more confrontations.

We are certainfthough, that this situation will be resolved. All who
are involved in this controversy, the Pitt administration, BAS, and the
Black Studies faculty have an obligation to maintain order and
tranquility at Pitt. The administration has already agreed to reassess-
its position, and Chancellor Posvar -has agreed to meet with BAS
representatives today. Hopefully, that reassessment will not be only
an attempt to pacify disgruntled students by allowing time to pass. By

the same token BAS

representatives

should abandon their

determination to install nothing less than Curtiss Porter to the Black

Studies chairmanship.

And most importantly the Black Studies faculty should offer guidance
to concerned students in this delicate matter answering their questions
rationally and avoiding the verbiage which-has served merely to detract .
from the real issues involved in the crisis. ‘ '

Surely, all who are involved in this controversy are rational people,
but wé must insist that reason and logic, and not emotion and
stubborness be the rule. And if any group shirks this responsibility
over the coming days and perhaps weeks, they will have to answer to
an angered and intolerant University community determined that
sense, intelligence. and calm permeate this campus.

Out of the closet

Letter to
The Editor

Dear Sirs:

In Wednesday’s editorial entitled~
“The Lewis Campaign” the Pitt
News editorial staff viciously and
unfairly attacked the gubernatorial
campaign of Drew Lewis. Setting
aside all partisan emotions, any
observer can readily see that the
aim of the Pitt News is anything but I
the providing of “a forum for two
candidates to discuss the important
issues facing the American go-
vernmental system.” 

In any race where a thallenger
faces an incumbent, it is the duty of
the challenger to highlight the
weaknesses of the opponent’s
administration, while emphasizing
his own strengths. Drew Lewis is
opposed to the present welfare
system and he has well illuminated

' its faults. In decrying the corrup-

tion of the Shapp administration,
Drew Lewis has pointed out the
Williamsport Cable TV deal and

the Frank Hilton scandal, to name .i

only a few instances. Drew Lewis
has made it clear that there is no
connection whatsoever between the
Lewis campaign and the activities
of the Gleason committee. Lewis
has more than adequately substan-
tiated his charges. "
Unfortunately for Pitt students,
the Pitt News has -done exactly
what Lewis has been mistakenly

been accused of--trying to “blind

the American people to the truth.”
Sincerely yours,
D’ou'g Yauger

New Republican Movement

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Republicans throughoutthe coun-
try are finally coming‘ out of the
closet in response to a new move-
ment towards freer expression in
the United States of formerly illegal
habits. V» ,

Republicans in the era following
Watergate were often regarded as
depraved deviants on the order of
dog-hangers and old women who
slip razor blades into Halloween
apples. _

They were forced to keep their
identity secret to protect them-
selves from social
punishment.

Although Ann Landers still re-
gards Republicans as sad and
unhappy perverts, many GOP'ers
are now tlauntingitheir political life
style proudly.

Some states such as Idaho are
repealing measures that called for
the sterilization and live burial of
professed Republicans. One thea-
tre in New York where Republicans
could only purchase seats facing
the wall is now admitting GOP’ers
into the regular audience on a trial
basis. '

Gerald Ford has openly condoned
the new movement. “Not that I'm a
Republican. but ‘I can see some
good coming of it. We need to heal
the wounds of the Wheat Deal and
the Prohibition. Even as a non-Re-
publican l can see a need for it.
although l'm not a Republican
myself. Did you get that last part‘."'

The pulpit and podium are re-
sounding with highly—charged
opinions on the new trend towards
open Republican sympathy. The
Right Reverend Henry Rockeater.

, tl»a1nQtts.prjeache_r and columnist has

ridicule and I

"decadent in the worst tradition of

Victorian England." '

Ann Landers primly side-stepped
the issue. “If I think about it too
long, I puke,” she said.

But regardless of the feelings of
the country's‘ moral leaders. Re-
publicans feel they are out of the
closet to st_ay.

“I'm not afraid of what people
think anymore," said Mr. X, a
highly placed government official
(but I didn't‘say what government).
“It's just a question of recognizing
the naturalness of Republican ex-
pression in the political arena."

The movement has escaped the
dimly-lit, seedy GOP bars where

' Republicans, often wearing masks

or paper-bags "cruised" to discuss
national policy.

“There is a dialectic rhetoric
going on in this country,” said
Ruby Wimple, representative of a
GOP political group. “That says
being Republican is just as natural,
just as beautiful a life style as a

liberal one. The change is coming..

Today it's Republicans, and the
day will come when fascists and
child molesters can be accepted

i just as easily."

Historically, many Republicans
point towards famous cultures such
as Greece and Sodom and Gem-
morah where GOP habits were
accepted as normal. They say these
nations flourished without 'restric-
tion. and this indicates acceptance
of Republican though is not “de-
struetive" to the individual ‘or
culture. - '

Overall many psychologists indi-
cate social acceptance will readjust
many of the problems which lead to

high Republican suicide rates and

vania has advocated the end of
shock treatment as a method for
“straightening those nuts out.”

Said one doctor, “I can see
nothing wrong with two consenting
adults’ engaging in Republican
discussion in the privacy of their
bedroom, with the blinds down, the
windows and doors locked, the
lights out and all the bibles.
Crucifixes and holy pictures taken
out of. the room, so long‘of course,
as they realize how disgusting
they're acting.“

So America, the Republicans are
out in the street again, powerful
and proud to some extent, and
whetheror not we like it, we'll have
to live with it.

Liberal Arts

,,,New Structures in the Undergraduate Program

BY ROBERT MARSHALL

Finally, to conclude this series of
articles on the Liberal Arts and
Careers 1 want to make some
references to the possibility of
introducing new structures into our
undergraduate program here at

_ Pitt.

I can’t say that I’ve given very
much thought to what such new
structures might be but rather, as I
have tried to suggest, to what the
role,- reduced or adapted, of the
Liberal Arts might be in such a

- system. I’m still not sure, as one
, who believes in the relevance of the
Liberal Arts ideal, whether it
makes more sense for me to argue
that the Liberal Arts School ought
to be a much smaller one limited to
those students committed to the
ideal, or that it ought to continue to
be the requirement that it in effect
is for most by virtue of the limited
number of undergraudate options.
When I do think of other options, I
think of what I consider to be one
very fruitful pair of educational
alternatives that already exists but
that is not really very available to
students. I’m thinking of the
differences between the philoso-

that one is a day-time school and
the other a night-time.

I think that the School of General
Studies has done a marvelousjob in
recent years in analyzing the needs
of its particular student body and of
adapting forms and programs and
philosophy to suit those needs. I
guess it’s fair to say that it was

‘once basically the evening version

of CAS. Now it has developed a
philosophy and system‘ of education
that offers a true alternative to
CAS, and I think that it might be
good if such an option were open to
all students.

What I mean is that the two
schools now have philosophies of

‘education "based on very different

definitions of pace and place and
progress and student body and
curriculum. Let me give some brief
illustrations.

CAS says through its rules and
structures that education best takes
place in a community, defined in
physical terms too. of learners. It
supports the concept of “resi-'
dency."_ Students and faculty
ought to be ,“in residence,” per-
haps not actually living in one place
but spending most of their time
together in one place, in Oakland.
SGS says that, in addition to that
possiblity, it will go out to where
students are, to Mt. Lebanon or
Monroeville, and set up school

'there—or even go to a student’s

home through the External Studies

 

program and adapt to the student's
own personal setting (with, grant-
ed, occasional community gather-
ings in Oakland).

1 don't know if these distinctions
of place seem insigniﬁcant to you.
They don’t to me. They deﬁne

-fundamentally varying concepts or

rhythms of educational philosophy.

Form is meaning; the medium is
the message.

CAS says, with few exceptions,
that learning ought to be full-time,
that there ought to be a definition
of minimum progress declared by
the system. It also defines a
degree in terms of quantity of time.
Whoever you are and whatever
you’ve accomplished before you
come to CAS, it is declared that you

spend four. years (or 120 credits),

with us to earn a bachelor’s degree.

SGS has no specific definition of
pace or minimum progress. Stu-
dents move at their own pace. And
SGS toia certain extent is involved
in the very different dynamic of
defining a degree not only in terms
of time spent but of stages of
accomplishment. It grants through
the CLEP system credit of know-
ledge gained on one’s own before
entering the system.

It is also much more, as I
understand it, involved than CAS
in the credit-by-examination -or
“Challenging courses" system. I
don't know where SGS stands on
credit for life-and-work experience,

     
    
    
  
  
   
  
   
   
  
   
 
  
    
  
   
  
 
 
 

but I would assume it is more open
to such possibilities than CAS. (All
this, of course, is still far short of
the concept of competence-based
education, which pushed this dif-
ference perhaps to its ultimate
conclusion. ' .

CAS assumes, by virtue of the
demands of its structures, that the
typical student will be the 18-to-22
year old who'has yet to begin a
career. SGS clearly has a different
kind of student body, the kind as a
matter of fact in whom there is
going to be a dramatic growth of
interest in future years as higher
education will apparently experi-
ence because of population pat-
terns a sharp drop in the number of
18-year-old applicants.

And, finally and appropriately,
CAS has the very clearly defined
sense of curriculum that has been
the "main topic of these articles.
SGS offers Liberal Arts majors but
also a great variety of professional
and pre-professional and career
programs. And it seems to me to
be prepared regularly -to adapt to
and add programs in the light of
changing needs and interests as
defined by society and by students.

I have a_ feeling that I have made
SGS sound more exciting than
CAS. I don’t mean to. I’m just
trying to make the point of
difference. I believe that the CAS
model, the CAS set of definitions,

is just as valid an option as that of

SGS in this constantly evolving .
debate about the best way fito‘ 
educate people. I am only
suggesting that perhaps that other
division between CAS and SGS, by
time of day or night, deprives
students of a very valuable set of
choices. Perhaps this whole debate:

the simple act of providing, to
day-time students the kinds ‘of
alternatives available to night-time
students. ‘  

One final point, unrelated to\the
above, about the possib~il_itEy”of new
undergraduate structures: I have
been saying that I admire and
defend the Liberal Arts ideal asii,
deﬁne it according to my biases. "I,
have also said that I am prepared to
abandon that ideal because I see it

very forces of professionalization

What I mean by that, in the
context of the topic of this article, is
that I for one could live with

specifically wanted to go on to

from 1970 to 1972. The special
commission undertaking the study
was chaired by Dr. Joseph
Newman, then chairman of the
‘Department of Special Education
and‘ Rehabilitation, School of
Education. .

The report on the “Study of
Problems of Accessibility for
Handicapped Students at the
University of Pittsburgh"--Oakland
Campus,” published in June, 1972,
concluded that “the Oakland
campus presents an academic
setting that offers very limited
accessibility to the handicapped
student, using the student in the
wheelchair as the criterion...-

“As for the structures them-
selves," the study continued,
“there is not a single building or

facility on the Oakland campus that ,

meets the recommended standards
for accessibility, following the
provisions of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania Act No. 235, 1965.”

This law.sets out the specifica-
tions for all buildings and facilities
built with state funds after 1965.
But there is a loophole.

‘Newman said, “Pitt: gets around
the law by saying that the "new
buildings were planned before
1965. They [the—University admini-
stration] look to observe the letter
and not the spirit of the law.”

But Newman added, “They have_
limited funds and I accept that,
because over the year's we’ve been
working with them‘ to initiate
actions to make the place accessi-
ble.’«’

According to the Newman Report
11 buildings on campus are
partially suitable, meeting some of
the standards set forth in“Act No.
235. Among the partially suitable
buildings are Bruce Hall, Lawrence
Hall and Frick Fine Arts. Nine
buildings, including Pennsylvania,
Scaife and Sche’nley Halls would
require minor modifications for
partial suitability. And yet another

11 buildings, among them Stephen
Foster, Heinz_Chapel and Thaw
Hall are not suitable for the
physically handicapped.

The Newman Report estimated
the necessary modifications, which
would include elevator installation
and modification, exterior and

interior ramp construction, rest-'

room, door, stair and handrail,
water fountain, parking ' space
modiﬁcations, fire alarm and other
control changes and curb cuts,
would cost $1,766,000.

That estimate made in 1970-1971
doesgnot include overhead, design
costs or “the purchase and
operations of an appropriately
equipped bus to transport wheel-

, chair students on the campus.” It

also does not include inflation.

“I think it's the state's responsi-
bility to see -that students have
access, Newman said. “There
should be a university to accommo-
date handicapped students.”

improving facilities at Pitt, New-

man said, “At Pitt this year we’ve »

been working on modifications of
the toilets in" the Cathedral of
Learning and making an automatic
door on the Bellefield Street side of
the Cathedral.

“And the City is planning a
federal project to put in curb cuts at
the corner of Forbes and Bigelow,"
Newman said. That sidewalk
modification was recently complet-

. ed.

Although architectural barriers
are a large part of the problem to
handicapped students, an equally
important problem is that of career

planning and personal counseling. ‘

“The disabled need career plan-
ning,” Newman said. “One re-
commendation in our report is that

there should be appointed as part’

of ‘the counseling service a
rehabilitation counsellor who will

“These counsellors,’ Newman
continued, “would assist not only
with campus problems but also
with living problems, like finding
an apartment, working to help the
deaf, blind and orthopedic."

Dr. June Mullens, assistant
professor in the Division of
Specialized Professional Develop-
ment‘ agreed there should be a
qualiﬁed counsellor to help meet
the special needs of the handi-
capped. ‘
Mullens, however, does not want
to see a special counseling service
that would deal with the personal
life problems of the handicapped.

Said Mullens, “I hoped there
would be no separate counseling
service because if_a handicapped
person has a. problem with a
boyfriend or girlfriend, the special
service probably would not be able
to handle it.”

said. 

“Although we have no clear idea

where it will be located, we hope to

Hayes explained the Office of

ODI: Community Lobby  

BY TOM WASELESKI

Not so long ago Oakland was the
scene of a continuing battle bet-
ween citizens and institutions over
who was to/determine the character
of the community.

Today all policies go through
Oakland Development, Inc. (ODI),
a municipal-type united nations
that currently’ includes 17 special
interest groups from the Oakland
area. j _

The objective of ODI is to act as a
planning group for the surrounding
community while considering the
conflicting interests of the different
groups involved. Members of ODI
include the University People's
Oakland, various citizen block
groups, the.._‘Health Center repre-
senting Oakland’s hospitals, the
Pittsburgh City Planning Commis-
sion, Carlow College, the Oakland
Chamber of Commerce, and other
groups.

According to Sandy Phillips, pres- L

ident of ODI. the organization
began in January, 1972. “The
problems of Oakland were so large,
so complicated that a body had to
be set up todeal with them. A
public meeting was held at WQED,
and ODI emerged from that.

“The power of 'ODI,” said Phil-
lips, “lies in the unification of
different interests. ”

ODl's most recent controversy has
involved the Pitt Student Union
Annex, located in the old Bimbo’s
building on Bouquet Street, Oak-;
land residents complained of mis-
use of the facility by the University.

Other points of concern include_

rising crime in the Oakland area,
deteriorated housing, traffic con-
gestion and the lack of adequate
mass transit for the community.
One case involving conflicting
interests and settled at least tem-
porarily. through ODI, is the vacant
lot adjoining Magee Hospital at the

corner of Craft and Forbes Aven-~

ues. \ .

The hospital originally conceived
the four and one-half acre site as a
heliport, ODl's Phillips said. But
after presentation to ODI it was
agreed the lot would be used as a
parking facility for an interim
period of four to five years, The
ultimate fate of the land is to be
plan_nedjointly by Magee and ODI.
_One possible use of the Magee
site, according to Dan Stickler, who
represents the Health Center at
ODI, would be for expansion of the

health center.
Viewing ODI as “a concensus

process bringing together people
and, institutions with conflicting
value systeins,” Stickilernsees the
organization as only “moderately
successful” in achieving its object-
ives: “On a scale of one to 10, with
10 being the highest possible
rating, I'd have to give ODI" a
four," said‘ Stickler, who believes
the citizens have more influence on
final decisions than do the institu-
tions. I

“ODI was designed to give citi-
zens majority power,” he asserted.
"But we need more participation,
particularly by students.” He
suggested a Pitt student represen-
tative be added in order to form a
stronger bloc.

The ...Pitt Tenant Union was a

member of ODI until last winter.
Phillips mentioned that “no stu-
dents attended _ODl meetings until
the Annex’ issue.” V e _
“I don't know how students feel
about ODI, but the average student
V doesn't seem concerned with com-
munity problems or university pro-
blems," she said.- » “ODI needs
student input. The people of the
community know Pitt doesn't speak
for its students or faculty."
Phillips is also on the steering
committee of at citizen’s group
known as People's Oakland, one of
the members of ODI. Open to
anyone concernedwith the Oakland
community, the group seeks to
define the problems faced ; by
citizens and direct their energies
toward proper solutions. 0
According ‘to Phillips, People’s
Oakland orginated in autumn 1970

' when citizens organized against a

dormitory Pitt had planned to build‘
near Falk School. “The area was
congested because of school traffic
and the Veterans Hospital. A dorm
of 1100 to 1300' occupancy would
have made things worse.”
- The conflict with Pitt intensified in
the summer of 1971 over the use of
Forbes Field, Phillips explained.
“The community-’s plans beat the
University’s plans in every re-
spect," Phillips said. p “This was
the first time the University faced
such great opposition; they soon
abandoned their master plan for
expansion through Oakland.
Joanne Chamberlain, a VISTA
volunteer in that program’s Archi-
tectfs Workshop. described a cur-
rent project of People’s Oakland
involving the renovation of Atwood

between the University and the
community is over the fact that if
growth is Pitt’s goal, and if great
planning and efficiency is not put

- in, it will be destructive to the

community. Today Pitt’s plans are
still not open, so it hasn't changed
one little bit.”

Jay Rolling, one of the Univer-
sity's representatives to ODI, sees
the situation differently. “The
University believes in ODI, and
we've gotten out of an adversary's
role. The community is aware of
our policy of acting in good faith.
Institutional expansion on our part
is over, and the renovation of
existing facilities is our next step.”

He mentioned Pitt agreed to
participate in ODI after serious
conflicts with Oakland residents.
“Our purpose is the betterment of
Oakland. Some groups belong to
ODI because they're interested in
long range solutions to this area's

problems concerning transit, crime
in the streets, housing, recreation,
and so on.

“ODI should now be structured to
solve these problems, rather than
remain an adverse forum to fight
the University as it has been and
was conceived. We’ve come a long
way, but I don’t think ODI has
resolved any of the overall pro-
blems of this area.”

Rolling stressed the need for
increased citizen input, expecially

by students. “ODI has to be
citizen-dominated by virture of its
charter," he said, noting the 51-49
edge citizens have in voting power.

“The community has lived in
constant fear of expansion because
they've seen people being moved
our.‘'" Rolling mentioned perhaps
university-citizen relations are cur-
rently in a cold war stage. “But it's
a helluvan advancement from
world war. Next comes detente.”

“Operation: Identification,” spon-
sored by LAC in conjunction with
the Campus Police, will offer
students a unique opportunity to
register their valuables as a guard
against theft.

Next week on Tuesday, Wednes-
day, and Thursday, November 29
through 31, desks will be stationed
at various residence hall lobbies.
Students are to bring their portable

valuables there to be etched. Items
too large and bulky to carry will be
etched in the student's room upon
request. These numbers will be
registered with both the campus
and city police squads.

Friday, November 1, will be set
aside especially for bicycle regis-
tration. Signs will be posted indi-
cating exact registration locations
for all types of valuables.

primarily concerned with providing
services to the handicapped, a
consumer-oriented approach.
“Using the ‘services first’ ap-
proach will give us a clearer idea as
to what the problems are," Hayes
said. Because there has been no

I input from handicapped students,

there are architectual problems.

“We will concentrate on individu-
al services first and then reduce the
architectural barriers,” Hayes ad-
ded. “We'll try to do those things
now that don’t require enormous
excesses of money.”

One handicapped Pitt student
sees the need for such services but
he says. he would like to get at the
roots of the problem.

wheelchair, said, “I do not want to
look at handicapped as a medical
problem, but rather as a social
problem."

Since he believes being handi-

.capped is a social problem,
Gearhart would like to see social
actions to resolve the problem.

Said Gearhart, “You solve social
problems through boycotts and
political actions. That's what the
black community has done. That's
what Chavez has done.”

Gearhart proposes the idea of a
“militant handicapped person” as
a way to remove the stereotypical
handicapped child image seen on
TV.

Arguing the point of societal
discrimination, Gearhart asked,
“Where is it written that steps are
a prerequisite to being a human
being?” , -

He also sees problems with the
people who work with the
handicapped. “Those who do the
most to rehabilitate put a ceiling on
development.

“Special education people, the
physical therapist, are the most
likely to have preconceived notions
of what the handicapped’s capabil-
ities are; they lack imagination and
don’t have that much faith in their
own work, in what a little bit of will
or luck can do for you to put you out
on the top of things," Gearhart
said.

Gearhart, who worked as a Vista
Vollfnteer last summer in New York
City, said, “We need a civil rights
bill. I’ve been turned down (for a
job) so many times that the phrase
‘hire the handicapped’ is ridicu-
lous.”

that this is a tentative attitude born
simply out of a desperate con-

speaking as a teacher of literature

may be to take away their territory,
to take away their large private
stockes of majors, to challenge
them to prove that they can do what
they claim they can do, liberalize
and humanize people, by giving
them certain pieces of undergra-
duate and graduate career and
professional programs and seeing
what they can do.

I would hope then‘ that, forced to

alternative to people, a subversive

Symphony In Reheorsol I

Sels Interesting Evening‘

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER

In the past week, Pitt hosted the
Pittsburgh Symphony Chamber
Orchestra, under assistant director
Donald Johannos.

s Seeing the orchestra in rehearsal
was quite a revelation. One rarely
has the opportunity to observe the
rehearsal process, and seeing these
persons in other clothing than the
mortician suits generally worn is
quite a change.

As recently as 1970, on almost any
weekend, it was possible to go over
to the Syria Mosque and get a
cheap ticket for a seat way over on
the side and hear-some of the finest
musicians in .the world play some
of the world’s finest music. Now
that the ’ Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra has moved in Heinz
Hall, that’s all over with. If you

Ra "‘“' ~-_want to hear Steinberg’s boys, you

have to ﬁgure on shelling out at
least six bucks a throw, which, for

some students ,_ is a good bite of the _

weekly budget. -
Bringing the Symphony back to
Oakland and other campus locales

for a week, including two ‘free.

concerts at Carnegie Music Hall,
was a great idea which we hope is
repeated. ,, '

In the Camegiei Music Hall
concerts, we heard seven composi-
tions, three of which were by
established composers.- .The first
concert began with “Variations,”
by Daniel Perlongo.

The second piece on the program
was “Concertino for Large Trom-
bone and Small Orchestra,” by
Byron McCulloh, who also played
the large trombone. He was

assisted by Don Franklin on the,

harpsichord- The piece begins with
the soloist playing a ,few bars from
offstage, and gradually strolling
onto the stage as he plays. The
work includes some interesting
techniques, such as humming and
playing at the same time, and, it
would seem on occasion, using the
stomach instead of the lungs for an
air source. -This is an interesting
and humorous piece. _ ‘

Final work of ‘the evening , was.
“Three Small. Liturgies of ?the I"
Divine Presence,” by Olivier

Messiaen. This work featured a
great; variety of instruments.,
including maracas, tam-tam, vi-
braphone, and soloists on piano
[Henry Spinelli]
electronic musical instrument, the
ondes martenot [Helen McGill].

The work also featured a women’s I I

chorus of students from Pitt and
other colleges in this area.

The work was a welcome change
from the elusive complexity of
other contemporary pieces. This
work is almost like a folk song in its
outward simplicity. The choir
remains in unison for most of the
piece, making’ its brief harmonies
that much more effective.
climax of the second movement of

’ this piece might have passed for a
19th centry piece.

The Friday concert began with the

Ives Symphony Number 3 [Camp .

Meeting), which is typical of Ives’
style, varying from lushly harmon-

and on an

The '

ious to the irreverent (go Charlie!)
and the boisterous. One of the
things which Ives seems to enjoy is
putting two melodies together
which just ought not to be put
together, and he does it well in this
work.

The next piece was “Sreams and
Willows," by Robert Morris. This
is a concerto for ampliﬁed ﬂute and
full orchestra. To get the orchestra
up to full size‘, student players were
added. In an attempt to project the
solo flute over the mumbles of the
orchestra, a microphone is thrown
in.

Since, for whatever reasons. none '

of the ﬂute-playing was ever clearly
heard, and often was completely
overwhelmed by the orchestra, the
abilities of the soloists, Bernard
Goldberg, were not demonstrated.

Ronald Braunstein won the BMI
composi’tio'n award for his “Ophelia
Diffusion,” ' a work for small
ensemble which is supposed to
picture the intrapsychic state of
Ophelia as she gradually edges
closer and closer to madness. It
succeeds. ~.This composer is one of
the few who said what he had to
say, and stopped.

Final piece on the program was ‘

“Flos Campi (the Flowers of the
Field]” by
liams.
and solo viola. Celesta and harp
added dimension to this piece’. The
beautiful piece would be worthy of
even more attention if it further
emphasized the viola, as there are
few works for this neglected
instrument. . A

"Time will tell whether some of
these pieces enjoy "any success, but
for those who went, it?‘ was an
interesting evening. ‘ "

Out with Tradition

PA Ballet;-All Dance Genres

BY TOBI ROSEN

All is not rotten in the state of
Pennsylvania. We’ve got the
Liberty Bell. And the Pittsburgh
Steelers. But most notably, we‘ve
got the Pennsylvania Ballet Com-
pany. -

Last Tuesday evening at Heinz
Hall, the PBC danced Pittsbur-
ghers off into oblivion. With
abounding skill, energy and talent,
the Company furnished immense
diversity of dance. And it was this,
diversity in style that determined
success.

It appears that Pittsburgh is rarely
blessed‘ with the Company’s
presence. As a former Philadelphi-
an, the Pennsylvania Ballet is a
familiar sight. But as a newcomer
to Pittsburgh, I"can not help but
feel that weare getting a sour deal.
The Pennsylvania Ballet Company
should be exactly that: Company
with equal residence’ throughout

the state. With a limited engage-

ment hovering above their heads,
the variation of range and scope of
performance is accountable. '
George Balanchine’s f“Concerto
Batgiocco" opened the bill with
symmetrical imagery -of black and
white. This was the most intense of
the three V presented, with its
emphasis on the beauty of
precision in body movement. It
expressed the rigorous and tortur:
ous training of a dancer. This is
dance in its pure and most chaste
form. The essence wasn't captured
in frilly tutu or sugar plum fairies.
But in the quest for physical
perfection and attainment of that

~ goal.

The second ballet, Harkarvy’s
“Time. Passed Summer” exposed
ballet as an intellectually stimulat-
ing experience. The work is a
psychological study of people

whose inner feelings are disguised
in white summer gowns and hidden
beneath wide straw hats. The
unmasking of the joys and sorrows
creates some fine lyrical dancing as
it provides a recital of Tchaikovsky
songs. The summery, dense mood
was sustained admirably, although
the piece could have been
shortened to heighten the impact.

Concluding the company’s repo-
toire was Rodham’s “An American
Rhapsody" with music by George
“ballet” is dis-
played as a “musical kaleidoscope
of America”. “Rhapsody" opened
my eyes to another inventive facet
of ballet: satirical ballet. American
screen dance teams (ie, Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rodgers, Gene
Kelly and Ruby Keeler, even a
dancing James Cagney with his
Moll) were the source of parody.

Big splashy high-kicking numbers
dazzled a startled audience. Smiles
glistened throughout the Hall. But_
one basic question kept turning
itself over and over in my mind. Is
_ this really ballet? Where were the
ballet slippers? And doesn't tap
belong on the stage and screen of f
Lerner and Lowe musicals? But this
ensemble number permitted the I .
dancers to spoof old time dance
mannerisms, while creating
charming moments and movement ’
to match the music's color and
excitement.

So, this is what ballet has come to: ‘

Porterfield explores all sides of

At Grove City Tomorrow

_ BY JIM SPANOS
The Pitt soccer team hustled and
played as well as they could in
hopes of upsetting the West
Tuesday
night, but the strength of WVU

~. ,4 prevailed and the Panthers lost 2-0.

It was just a matter of the Cats
being outmanned by the highly
skilled Mountaineers, who scored a
goal in each half to clinch the win.

The first West Virginia goal came
17 minutes into the first half when,
on a two on one breakway, Hermin

if Pinto and Manny Matos teamed up

for the score. Pinto started the’ play
on the Cats’ 30 yard line, dribbling
the ball down the center of the
field. He passed off to Matos, who
gave the ball back to Pinto when
Panther defender Ernie Gross
raced after him. Pinto was then one
on one against Pitt goalie Fred
Dohrmann, a freshman starting in
place of the injured Frank Bucci,
and Pinto drilled the ball past
Dohrmann,who had no chance for
a save.

With-20 minutes left in the game
WVU tallied their second goal.

The Naval Academy will go into
tomorrow’s game against Pitt with
a 2-4 record with Notre Dame the
next team on their schedule.
Understandably, Navy coach
George Welsh is very concerned
about his team’s chances of coming
through the next two weeks with
much more than their lives.

The Middies are currently nursing
a four game losing streak which
started against Michigan after the
Midshipmen had jumped out to a
2-0 record with wins over Virginia

and Penn State. Last weekend,,

they suffered their most depressing
defeat at the hands of "the Air
Force Academy when a rash of
turnovers in the fourth quarter
enabled the Falcons "to score a

touchdown and two field goals to

gain a 19-16 victory.

“You can’t make mistakes like
that all at once," said Welsh. “We
turned the ball over three times
and then made a couple of other
errors. But we still have five games

Wallace had a few chances to
score, West Virginia’s defense
made very few mistakes.

Pitt was able to move the ball from ‘

one end of the field to the other
with Alan Jutca, Andy Behrend,
Tom Murphy, Nick Chrisanthon,
John Morahan, and Billy Rex on
the attack, but the West Virginia
defense stiffened when Pitt moved
the ball into scoring range.

The loss gives the Panthers a
2-4-2 record for the year, with
games remaining against‘, Grove
City on Saturday, Indiana, Gannon
and the season finale against Penn
State.

“We should win our next three
games," said Pitt coach Leo Bemis.
“However, Saturday’s game a-
gainst Grove City will not be an
easy one. They have a 4-3 record,
and they can score points."

Pitt is now in the position that
they just about have to win their
next three games in order to finish
the season with a .500 record. That
would give the Panthers a 5-4-2
record going into the encounter
with‘ Penn State, who ‘ defeated
WVU 7-2.

year’s record. I’ve said all a long
we’ve got to learn to overcome
adversity.” '\

The Midshipmen will face all the
adversity they care to see tomorrow
against a heavily favored Panther
squad that has come on in the last
two to_ live up to the pre-season
predictions. However, five of the
last seven games between Pitt and
Navy have been decided by ﬁve
points or less. Last year’s contest at
Pitt Stadium was won by Pitt when
Billy Daniels scored in the ﬁnal
minute to give the Cats a 22-17
edge.

Tomorrow’s game will feature the
respective all-time rushing leaders
for each school. Tony Dorsett will
carry his usual amount of the
Panther" burden and Cleveland
Cooper, who tallied 126 yards on 26
carries against Pitt last year, will
lead the rather unproductive Navy
attack.

The Middies started the season
with a Veer offense but‘ their small
offensive line forced them to switch
to a split offense with more dive
plays. Cooper has hampered most
by the swath gaining only 39 yards
in Navy’s second, third, and fourth
games. ,

“Cleveland Cooper was used to
being an I tailback and he didn't
adjust .well to the veer,” said
Welsh. “He doesn’t have the
outstanding speed of a. Tony
Dorsett.”

Navy’s quarterback tomorrow will
be Phil Poirier who has completed
40 of 93 passes so far this season
for 488 yards. Poirier won the
starting job away from junior Mike
Yeager who was then switch to split
end. '

“He’s too good an athlete not to
have him in the game for us," said
Welsh concerning Yeager's switch.
“We thought wide receiver was
one spot to which we could more
Mike and he could play early.”

Anticipation is what being a
linebacker is all about. It is that
extra jump on the ball
separates the average player from
the gamebreaker. It is this ability to
read plays before they are executed
that has made Kelcy Daviston one
of Pitt's defensive leaders.

It is this talent that has enabled
Daviston to amass a total of 40
tackles and six assists in just six
games, but Daviston isn’t looking
back on past performances. He is
more interested in preparing for
Pitt’s upcoming games.

“We’ve all learned not to take. any
team for granted any more," says
Kelcy, or KD as he is known by his
teammates. “After the Southern
Cal game, we thought we were
really going to kill North Carolina.
Because we didn't, we learned a

that j

v

valuable lesson.’ .

The Panthers are a more cohesive
unit now, and Daviston is an
important part of that unit, both as
a player and as a team leader.
Johnny Majors has looked to the

senior for leadership all year long, -

and one of the people he can count
on is Kelcy. I -

“The seniors have got to be a big
help to the younger, Iessexperi-
enced guys,” said KD. “Some of
these younger guys don’t know
about all the downs and ups that a
team goes through, and the seniors
are supposed to show them.”

This is Daviston’s second year on
the team. ‘When Johnny Majors
came to Pitt, Daviston was enrolled
in night school, but when spring
drills rolled around Kelcy reported

/and won a starting position.

"Just going to school was getting

to be a drag," said Daviston. “Sol
decided to go out for the team. On
the first day. I moved up from last
string to second string linebacker,
and by the time the second day of
spring drills was over. I was the
first string linebacker." -
It isn’t as if Daviston just poppe

out of nowhere to become a starter
for Pitt’s first winning team in 10
years. Kelcy had been All-State
and All-Conference at Duquesne,
and had been selected to Pennsyl-

vania’s Big 33 team. He had been’

originally enrolled at Arizona State
and learned a lot there about

football before coming back home. .

“They were looking for someone
who could hit and get to the ball,"
said Daviston, “and ljust showed
them what I could do."

Whatever KD showed the coaches

The Middies will be without the

Navy last year. It will be

provide some enthusiasm for the
game. Welsh, however, is some-
what skeptical about his team's
_chances.

“It looks like Pitt has a good
football team again,” said Welsh.
“The way they blocked Boston
College up front, that's a sound
football team. Pitt certainly is as
good a team as Notre Dame. We're
going to have our problems

Only a desperate attempt in the
final minute of play, with goalie
Giles Gilbert out of the net in favor
of a sixth attacker. gave Boston a
5-5 tie.

A loud knock came at the far left

-entrance to the locker room and

Hodge raised his view to yell at the
top of his lungs. “Get the bleep out
of here and go around the other
bleeping way...” It was the Boston
trainer. '
The perenial highest scoring line
in the NHL had nothing to be proud

\ of. -They_ skated as if rubber
7 guards were still attached to their

blades, not digging in the corners
and overskating the puck frequent-
ly. ‘ ' '

“Better catch me next time a-
round,“ a balding Cashman grum-
bled. “There's not much I feel like

performance was, as usual, the
play of defenseman Bobby Orr, Mr.
Everything, the greatest player to

lace up a pair of skates in the
history of the NHL.

- 0rr’s hat trick, and particularly

his unassisted goal on a break-
away, gave the annual all star some
consolation to overshadow the
Bruins’ play. In the five previous
games, Orr had been off to a
relatively slow start and hadn’t
That naturally
meant the Bruins were off to a bad
start in general, winning two and
losing two with one tie.

“We're an offensive team," Orr
said. “and that can be awfully
tough on our goaltenders at times.
Our main concern right now is our

team goals against. We’ve got to
cut them down."

The new Bruin coach, Don
Cherry, was promising a return to
the days of the “Big Bad Boston

~ Bruins," after watching them take

a lesson in hustling from Philadel-

phia in the Stanley Cup Finals. But
the initial reaction from the public
and the media was to expect more
ﬁghting, exaggerated physical
checking and general mania from
the Bruins.

A  Defen.sive Leader

I’Conti7zued from Page 13)
in those first two days was enough

for him to break into the starting
lineup, and his performances in the
last two seasons have been no
letdown. ‘

One thing that Kelcy does very
well and very hard is hit.

“I really love the contact,” he
said. ‘‘I don't like to get hit, but I
really like to stick someone else
with a good hit. Sometimes when
you’re-nervous in the beginning of
the game, the first good hit snaps

.you out of it."
_ It is this attitude towards contact

that makes Daviston as effective as
he is. Not being afraid to hit or be
hit helps make the big plays, as
linebackers are supposed to do in
order for their team to come out on
top.

“You have to develop a mental
attitude on you own,” said
Daviston. “You get some guys who
bite off their fingernails or bang
their heads against the wall to get
psyched up for a game. I can’t do
that. I just know that we have to
wingand get psyched for a game.”

Daviston doesn’t bang his head
against the wall or bite his
ﬁngernails, but he does other
things. One of those things is to
meditate.

“I read a lot about universal law,
metaphysics and philosophy, and
meditate about them,” said Kelcy.
“It helps my frame of mind.”

Whatever meditating does for
him, it had better do a lot of it for
tomorrow’s game at Annapolis.
The Middies are looking to pull off
their second big upset of the year

with Pitt as their victims in front of ‘E

a homecoming crowd at the Naval
Academy, and it will be up to
Daviston and the rest of the
Panther defense to stop the
well-balanced attack of the Mid-
shipmen.

“We can’t take any team for
granted,” said Daviston. “We
were told that Navy’s big goals this
year were to beat Penn State_ and
Pitt, and they already took care of
Penn State.”

Bill Virdon
Signs Two
Year Pact

f*~..,\ NEW YORK AP — Bill Virdon.
~ who almost managed the New York
Yankees to the American League’s
1974 East Division title. signed a
two year contract with the club
today.
Virdon was hired by the Yankees
last winter, agreeing to a one year
contract for an estimated $50,000.
New York stayed in the American
League pennant fight until the final
three days of the season when
Baltimore clinched the East Divi-
sion title. The ﬁnish was the best
for the Yankees since their last
pennant in 1964.

The Year .

BY KEN RAPPOPORT

NEW YORK AP —— Brash Billy
Martin, who magically turned the
Texas Rangers from a loser intoa
winner in one year, was named the
Associated Press’ American Lea-
gue Manager of the Year Thurs-
day.

‘.

Martin, who drove a last place
. team into pennant contention over-
_{ﬂ;‘nlght, won a hot race with Bill
’ I Virdon of the New York Yankees. 4
Sports writers and broadcasters
_around the.nation gave Martin 195
_ votes to 183 for Virdon, who kept
his Yankees alive in’ the AL East

race until the end of the season.

Earl Weaver, manager of the AL _

East champion Baltimore Orioles,
‘finished third in the voting with 15
while Manager Alvin Dark of the
world champion’ Oakland A’s- has
11' forfourth. Votes were taken
before the start of the playoffs.

The rest of the field included;
Ken Aspormonte of Cleveland with

_ three; Minnesota’s_ Frank Quilici,

K, 4 ' three; Darrell Johnson of Boston

with one and Ralph Houk of
Detroit, one.

Martin gained a fiery reputation
as a player with the Yankees, and
has enhanced it as a big league
manager. His career has been
marked by fist fights with players

and fans alike since he brought a -

Western Division pennant to Min-
nesota in 1969.

He joined Detroit in 1971 and
managed for threeiyears, winning
an Eastern Division flay in 1972.
he left the Tiger organization late
in 1973 and was hired as the Texas

4".‘-..n1anager with 23 games left in the
" season.

Battling every inch of the_ way,
Martin has his 1974 Rangers alive

days of the season. They finished a

were simply fantastic.”

The only two seniors on the team,‘
Paty Adams and Kathleen Turner

“It was just getting started.”
Leslie Nichols added “Thanks to

PITTSBURGH AP —— The Pitts-
burgh Pirates sent' left handed
pitcher Juan Pizarro to their
Charleston farm club Thursday and
‘placed former major league right
hander Wayne_2Simpson on their
roster.

I .

Pizarro, 37, was signed as a free

i agent by the Pirates on August 20,

He had a 1-1 record with a 1.88
earned run average in seven games
during the club’s stretch drive for
the National League East Division
title. ‘

Because of his veteran status,
Pizarro had to agree to the move. A
Pirate spokesman said Pizarro
wouldbe invited to spring training
if he is_not drafted by another club
in the major league draft.-

(Continued from Page‘14_)

Not so, Orr clarified.

“A lot of writers talk to Don
(Cherry) and ask him about that
statement," Orrsaid, “and most of
them misinterpret it. We sure
won’t be trying to skate guys right
into the boards and taking cheap
and unnecessary penalties. '
