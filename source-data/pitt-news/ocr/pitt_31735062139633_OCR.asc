Depauw President Criticises Anti-
Fascist Methods

ATLANTIC CITY.—Feb. 26. (Spe-
cial)—“Education must light the way
for social change,” said President
Roosevelt Monday in a letter to the
National Education Association, meet-
ing in convention here this week.

The menaces of Communism and
Fascism were called a. “terrible chal-
lenge to democracy” by G. Bromley
Oxnam, president of Depauw Univer-
sity, speaking at a meeting of the as-
sociation's department of superin-
tendence.

On the other hand. he warned the
5,000 delegates to guard against an
attack on._the schools by interests who
“profess to hate Communism and
Fascism but whose methods create
the conditions that destroy faith in
democracy and cause unthinking men
to turn to other proposals.”

Several members of the faculty of
the School of Education, including Dr.
Charles E. Pi-all. dean of the School,
have been attending the convention.

‘I Worked On The

Morro Castle,’

Says Globe-Trotting Freshman

 

“I knew something would hap-
pen [to the Morro Castle. The
day I left it I saw a black cat
swimming atlthe bow.”

Donald Collins, BA38, who worked
his way around the globe last autumn,
was telephone operator on the S. S.
Morro Castle shortly before it burned.

Caught in a typhoon . . rammed
by a tug . . grounded on a reef—-
thesc were some of Collins’ experi-
ences shortly after he ﬁnished
Peabody High school and got a job as
helper in the storage department of
t.he S. S. President Johnson.

His ship sailed from New York
harbor and was lying at anchor in
Manila after an uneventful voyage
across the Paciﬁc when the typhoon
struck them.

“I was on deck. It had been a
clear day, but at about 2 o’clock
it suddenly became pitch dark.

When the gale hit us it almost
tore us loose from our moorings.
An incoming tug, caught in the
high waves and darkness, rammed
us and tore some plates off our
starboard. We patched the hole
before much water got into the
hold."

The President Johnson also ran
aground near Shanghai when the pilot
misjudged the depth of a reef. The
ship .was delayed until a high tide
ﬂoated it off.

Collins was unable to earn enough
from his ﬁrst job to pay his tuition,
so he became telephone operator and
night watchman on the ill-fated Morro
Castle after his return. He added:

“I certainly was lucky that my
contract expired two weeks before

the ship burned. So far as I

know. the crew was able to run

the boat safely. I think some-
thing else caused the disaster."

February Shows
Favorable Indices

Bureau Of Business Research
Review Appears Tomorrow

The index of business activity for
the three weeks ending February 2,
9, and 1.6, shows a substantial increase
over ﬁgures for the corresponding pe-
riod of 1934, according to the Uni-
versity Bureau of Business Research,
whose monthly Business Review bul-
letin appears tomorrow. ~

The highest level of activity in
those three weeks was recorded for
the six days preceding the" tenth; the
previous week was slightly surpassed
in activity by the week closing the
sixteenth. ,

For the Pittsburgh district, indices

show “that ‘general’ ' business ’activity'

was at 71.7 as of February 16. Pro-
duction ﬁgures demonstrated a (lecline
compared with the preceding week,
but the trade index showed an in-
crease.

The trade index, composed of de-
partment store sales, new motor reg-
istrations, bank debits, and bank
clearings, rose from 73.5 to 75.5 dur-
ing the same-week.

A comparison of the general index
for the ﬁrst three weeks of February
a11d for the week of February 17, 1934_
shows the level at 60.8 last year, and
at 71.5. 72.6, and 71.7, in order, for
three February weeks of this year.

Financial Crisis In State

Discussed By Dr. McKay

Dr. Marion K. McKay, professor of

Petitioners Seek
Student Support
In Turner Case

Ask Recall Of Former Professor;
Another Petition Seeks
Birth Control Reform

Petitioners were doing their best
today to give expression to “the voice
of the people,” as no less than three
petitions went the rounds.

The case of Dr. Ralph E. Turner,
former University professor, and one
of the principal ﬁgures in the AAUP

report on the policies of the Univer-

sity, is taken up in the ﬁrst petition.
It says:

“The following students at the
University of Pittsburgh petition
for the reinstatement of Pro-
fessor Ralph E. Turner.” '
The promoters of the petition will

present it to Dr. John G. Bowman,
Chancellor, when they have 200 or
more names.

A second petition, on a social ques-
tion, was Miss Margaret Sanger’s
‘model birth ‘control;p'etition’to be pre-
sented to Franklin D. Roosevelt. In
substance the petition asks for a
codiﬁcation of existing birth control
laws “in order that parents may ob-
tain proper scientiﬁc instruction on
birth control to enable them to con-
Irol the size of their families in con-
sideration of the health of the mothers
and the earning capacity of the fath-
erg’?!

The students supporting these peti-
tions claim that more than 40 students
had signed the ﬁrst day and that a
faculty member had also signed.

A third petition is said to have
been circulating on the campus asking
for iinmediate investigation, by the
state legislature, of the policies of the
administration of the University. A
reporter, however, could ﬁnd no trace
of such a petition.

Spiritualism Attacked
‘At Psychology Forum

“Add to the ticking of a clock a
pound of superstition, a dash of fear,
and a transcendent3.1ist theory and
the result is a perfect hallucination.”
That, according to Dr. William T.
Root, professor of psychology, who ad-
dressed the psychology forum on
“Psychica1 Research” Monday after-
noon, is the usual recipe for psychic
phenomena.

Speaking of such spiritualistic mani-
festations as “thought transference,
mental telepathy, spirit seances, and
the like, Dr. Root said, “In elaborate
experiments conducted at Stanford
universitythere has been no evidence
of the power of the so-called ‘psychic’
to operate under controlled condi-
tions.”

“Seance spirits,” says the Stanford
report, “speak with the psychic’s vocal
chords, manipulate material objects
with her hands, and possess informa-
tion limited by the contents of her
mind.”

Second Newsreel
To Appear Today

Lloyd George, Huey Long Talk
At Least Ten Gents Worth

From Bolivia to Venice, from Lloyd
George to Huey Long, from butter-
ﬂies to blizza1'ds. That's the range
of the SEA Newsreel, offering its sec-
ond program today. The program, for
which the admission charge is ten
cents, will be repeated at the Schen-
le_v tlieater every class hour from the
third through the seventh.

One of the high spots of today’s
newsreel shows scenes of war be-
tween Bolivia and Paraguay. The
pictures are said to be the ﬁrst taken
at the Gran -Chaco front.

A trip through 2. Venice glass shop,
where for centuries ﬁne craftsmen
have "fabricated exquisite Venetian
glass, provides an interesting interval
in the 50 minute program.

Many students will. hea.r.for the
first time the voice of Lloyd George,
British statesman, as he makes an ap-
peal for an English “New Deal.” Also
of political interest is Huey Long,
snapping his suspenders and explain-
ing his “share of the wealth” plan,
under which, according to Huey, “You
can have four or ﬁve mi1lion——but
that’s all.”

Other reels, such as the one follow-
ing in detail the development of the
swallowtail butterfly, are of general
rather than of current interest.

The promotion committee has been
increased by the addition of the fol-
lowing members: William Stark,
C38; Lloyd -Gluck, C36; and Morris
Rosenbloom, C36.

b (rip and Gown, “In the Soup,”
temporarily simmered over and
was literally “in the ﬁre” Mon-
day afternoon aifew hours before
the ﬁrst. rehearsal. Temperatures
were reduced, however, without
spoiling the broth.

The trouble came with announce-
ment. by Miss Ruth Miller that she
would be unable to take the position
as director of the chorus. She said
that the responsibility of Can and

Gown would inter-
_fere with revised
schedules at the
Alvin theater.
Miss Miller is at

tract to the Harris

Theodore W.

Biddle, supervis-

ing chef in charge

of preparing the
show, however,
was ready for emergencies.
nounced that Eugene Kelly, ‘33, had
been engaged to replace Miss Miller
as coach of the chorus.

He‘-l_v, who is a dance instructor in
Pittsbuigll and Johnstown, is a for-
mer Cap and Gowner, having starred
in “\Vl1at"s Up,” “The Silver Dom-
ino,” and “All to the Point.” hit shows
of "31, ’32, and ’33. He received
tliree-star plaudits from the local
critics for his dancing ability.

Commenting on his engagement by
the Cap and Gown club as dance di-
rector, Mr. Kelly said:

 

 

Ruth Miller

"I certainly am happy to be back
with can and Gown, even as a di-
rector and not a participant. I think
the follows are going to have a lot
of fun, and with their cooperation,
I'm sure that we can turn out a
swell show.” ‘

The boards of the Y Hut trembled
under the weight of 134 applicants at
the preliminary instruction class Mon-
day evening at 8:45 o’clock. Whether
or not the boys expected Miss Miller
to be there in romper-s-is notknown;
they did, however, show a lot of en-
thusiasm and seemed to be thorough-
ly satisﬁed with “Gene” as dance di-
rector. Mr. Biddle, Mr. Theodore Vieh-
man, director of Cap and Gown, and
Mr. Kelly made introductory an-
nouncements and then started in im-
mediately with preliminary instruc-
tion. High kicks, a. tap step, and a
soft shoe number comprised the work
of the evening. '

First eliminations took place last
night at 7 :30 o’clock and applicants

are to consult the Cap and Gown bul-x

letin boards to see if they are still
in the show. The next elimination is
tonight at 7:30 o’clock.

‘Cast rehearsals start this after-
noon in the Y Hut at 4 o’clock. All
men interested in a principal part
should report to Mr. Viehman today
or tomorrow between 4 and 6 o'clock
in Room 1 at the Y Hut. The ﬁnal
cast try-outs will be Monday at 8:30
o’clock.

There will also be .1 meeting of the
music committee of the Graduate
club this evening at 9:30 o’clock. All
students who have submitted music
should report in person to play their
numbers.

Falk Elementary School Principal
Discusses New Type Of Learning

 

“Some teaching and much learning,”
by Martin P. Chworowsky, principal
of the Falk Elementary school, is the
feature article in the latest issue of
the Alumni Review, edited by Don
Saunders.

In his article, Mr. Chworowsky
shows the difference between the
Falk School and the traditional
school. When asked, “VVhat is the
Falk School?” he replies, "11: is an
elementary school in which there is
some teaching and much learning.”

The educator states that “as a de-
partment of the University, the Falk
School is in a position to cooperate
with other departments in improving
its work; with the School of Medicine
and department of physical education
in developing a health program; and
with the School of Education in dem-
onstruting new practices in element-
ary teaching. Our library is a branch
of the University library.”

This year, 110 children ranging from
the ages of three to 12, attend the
Falk School. The building, above the
University campus, contains eight
spacious class rooms, a. library, audi-
torium, gymnasium, an arts and crafts
room, a wood and metal workshop, 3.
kitchen and oﬁices. The nursery and
kindergarten rooms are separate
suites. Each of the other classrooms

has a. small adjoining study in which

children may work as individuals or
in small groups.

- A large outdoor playgroundand-play
dc-;c.lzs for the younger children give
ample opportunity for healthy exer-
Cise and play.

According to the principal, “M,em-
bers of the staff are chosen for per-
sonality, background. professional
skill and interests. They have a cul-
tural bockground and an insight into
the problems of the modern world.
They are graduates of the best pro-
fcssional training, and they keep in
constant yet critical touch with new
developments in teaching.”

The Falk School, says its head,
differs from other schools in that it
maintains and develops the child's
natural eagerness to learn, and guides
the child so that he develops habits,
skills, information, and attitudes.
This modern school aims to develop
the “whole child,” and is not merely
concerned with academic training. It‘
strives to keep alive in the child that
youthful enthusiasm and curiosity
that is the basis for his learning out-
side of classes.

This issue of the Review also con-
tains alumni news, “Activities of con-
stituent association.” “Athletics at
the University,” and alumni notes.

CROSS THE PAGE Columnist

Alan Lloyd has a message on
college spirit that seems to re-
quire a few amendments. College
spirit, he affirms, should be in-
-tensely internal and so “the ﬁrst
thing to do would be to organize
every force here now into a coop-
crating force.”
be composed of fraternity and
sorority groups naturally, “and
every other group with a solid
bond.”

The possible purposes of this
group are a little alarming, for
besides enforcing cheering at
football games. it would “enforce
campus activities and campus af-
fairs.” A certain amount of en-
forcement, it seems, would have
to be gr-iven to the administration,
and “under the sponsorship of
the Y and of the Dean’s office,
every student should get into at
least one activity.” Physical
hazing is to be prohibited, ap-
parently in favor of a gentle sort
of mental regulation.

That college students enjoy
mild degrees of mental regula-
tion is clear to themselves and to
anybody who ever joined a club
or followed a school of thought.
Probably, as Alan Lloyd suggests,
there will be more and more ef-
fort to persuade students into de-
sirable tastes and activities. In
the light of this probability, then,
we offer the outline of a. scheme:

1. Divide the four-year college
course into two parts.

2. Give a suitable diploma,
and a suitable degree, to persons
completing two years of resi-
dence. ’l‘o such persons would
pertain all the rights and privi-
leges of a bach_elor of arts. Let
them be exclusively concerned
with trying new courses, joining
activities (where all the highest
offices should be reserved for
them), leading dances, cheering
at athletic games, and wearing
activity keys.

3. At the end of two years,
give comprehensive examinations
to any candidates there may be
for advanced study. Those with
suitable achievement would then
begin intensive study of their
special interests, whether profes-
sional or academic. It would be
slightly bad taste to wear activ-
ity keys after that.

G. K. Chesterton, I believe, spoke
There are as many reac-

tions to the novel as there are philosophies; certainly the stir which it has
aroused indicates struggle on the part of the author and critics to penetrate
and understand the complexities of the existence which our civilization has

I produced.
Not all the attitudes which have¢

been expressed by readers are pro-
ductive. The literary technicians have
admired the manipulation of words;
members of leagues for the preven-
tion of immorality, finding in Joyce,
perhaps, echoes of their own inner
nature, have shouted about obscenity
and falsehood; those who enjoy atti-
tudes of delusion have in sophisticat-

ed fashion murmured their approval.
These attitudes are barren. Sick peo-
ple are not good diagnosticians.
Other critics, fortiﬁed by a dislike

%for certain phases of the life of their

times, have seen Ulysses as a docu-

ment expressive of those phases
which they dislike.
The approaches are many, but

there is a real Ulysses, just as there
is a real Russia. I here present my
theory, cloaked in the dogmatism of
absolute certainty, of course, which I
find happily in agreement with my
own prejudices.

Nothing But To Despair.

What of all the will“ to do?
It has vanished long ago.

Joyce introduces this poem into the
thoughts of Stephen Daedalus. With-
out beneﬁt of technique he has set
down his basic philosophy. Now,
Joyce believes, there is no will to do;
people live dead lives; he cannot
ﬁght against this ugliness, he cannot
sympathize with those who act in
it, he can only despair. And despair
Joyce does; he despairs on every
page of the book. He seems to wish
that the will to do might be more
virulent; he seems to wish that his
characters would, if only once, do
something that would jostle his own
troubled moping. But their lives offer
no basis for pounding ﬁsts or tolerant
smiles. Joyce can but report sin-
cerely his reactions to his age.

Ulysses was conceived in a com-
plete manner. The reader is not to
understand Mr. Bloom or Stephen
Daedalus by their outward actions

and spoken sentences alone. He is to
learn just what these gentlemen
think: he is to explore completely

their minds; he is to ﬁnd little there.
Joyce puts his characters in situa-
tions of vastly different natures and
lets them think.

A group of men are on their way
to a funeral. One of them, breaking
off a joke, announces “VVe had better
look a. little serious,” and the men
fall into a sentimenta.l ‘vein; they
bring out the old stock phrases; they
say what they are expected to say.
At the cemetery Mr. Bloom is able

to bring his mind to consider the con-
servation of space which would re-
sult from the burying of corpses in
a vertical position, and the coin-
mercial possibilities of selling bodies
as fertilizer for gardens. These men
can stril-te no deeper notes. At most
they feel only a certain vague sad-
ness in anticipation of their own
deaths.

Shakespeare And Dublin

V.-Ie ﬁnd Stephen Daedalus discuss-
ing himself and talking about Shake-
speare. His dissertation on the ne-
cessity for ﬁlial disobedience fades to
uniinportance in the stilling at-
mosphere of futility and unhappiness.
Mr. Bloom ent.ers a restaurant: “See
the animals feed Perched on
high stools by the bar, hats shoved
back, at the tables calling for more
bread no charge, swilling Wolfing
gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes
bulging, wiping wetted mustaches

. Every fellow for his own, tooth
and nail. Glub. Grub. Glub. Gob-
stuff Eat or be eaten. Kill!
Kill!” Through Mr. Bloom we see
the city with its meaningless camar-
aderie and sensuality that grasps, re-
volts, weakens. The confusion, the
animality of each scene is potent,
whether the scene deal with church-
man, student, or harlot; but the
potency overwhelms. It
heavy, stifling.

Nighttown

These atmospheres are faint and
inconsequ_ential when viewed in the
light of what follows. Mr. Bloom goes
to the maternity hospital to inquire
as to the health of the wife of a
friend, and joins a group of medical
students who are drinking and joking
obscenely about cliildbirth. A child
is born to the friend’s wife, and the
group pours out to a pub. Stephen
and Bloom, well drunk, proceed to a
brothel. The scenes in Nighttown are
seen through the confused high relief
of B1oom’s intoxication. Persons and
events he has encountered during the
day rise up. His past—his lack of at-
tention to his fat.her’s religion (for he
is  Jew converted to Catholicism)——
confronts him.

All these confused demoniacal im-
ages of drunkenness swirl around in
a scene of commercialized sensuality
and squalor. VVe feel ourselves the
cool, lue, mechanical walls and
pianos and chandeliers; yet we see
everything in the confusion, the mad-
ness, the passive horror of minds
gone wandering in meaningless an-
imal regions.

Persia has a future.

According to Mahmoud Rakchani,
24-year-old student sent here by the
government:

“Persia is growing. Under
Reza Shah Pehlevi, the country
is rapidly being transformed into
a live, eager nation. Through
new schools, railroads, highways
and industries, -Persia is losing
its medieval character. Shah
Pehlevi is a good king and is giv-
ing the 14,000,080 people a peace-
ful government.”

M1‘. Rakchani is beginning his
training here in petroleum reﬁning.
He arrived a few months ago direct
from Strasbourg, Alsace Lorraine,
where he attended a reﬁning school.
He spent ﬁve years in France and be-
sides French, Persian and English, he
speaks Arabic.

When he returns to Teheran, capl-
tal of Persia, he will work for the gov-
ernment. He said:

“Today the Anglo-Persian com-
pany in Abadan, Southwest Per-
sia, owns the only refinery in the
country. The government, how-
ever, is beginning to enter the oil
industry. Persia has the third
greatest oil reserve in the world,
although in production it ranks
sixth because of lack of refiner-
ies.”

Mr. Rakchani said he first heard of
Pitt in New York. He. added:

“You-r methods of teaching here
differ from the French in the
amount of practical training given.
French schools emphasize theory.

‘‘I’m glad I came.”

Mr. I-‘takcliani is now investigating
the possibilities of having a Persian
room in the Cathedral. He already
has written his government.

Freshman Regulations And School ,
Spirit Are Commended By Lloyd

 

By Alan C. Lloyd

OB AND I sank deep into the

settee in the Y-hut, and glanced
about the room. Two young fellows
were playing a. mild variety of ping-
pong. A group leader dashed around
with erect shoulders, herding to-
gether his freshmen for a luncheon
conference. At the oillce door, Big
Bill came out for a moment and
turned back. In the luncheon room a
plate rattled. A door slammed. At
the piano someone picked out with
one ﬁnger, "The object of my affec-
tion . .” and a boy eating a box
lunch near the center window began
to beat time with his foot.

“Just what do you mean by ‘school
spirit‘?” Rob asked. He stooped and
caught the ping pong ball. “Do you
mean this college rhythm, this rah-
rah stuff?”

I was silent for a couple of minutes,
for, after all, it is rather a difficult
thing‘ to define. The boy at the piano
still chopped away. The door in Room
1 closed behind the freshmen.

“School spirit,” I began cau-
tiously, “is a pride and loyalty in
one’s school, loyalty to the extent
of participation in its activities.

It is something intangible, of

course, yet a something that

makes a fellow glad to be here.”

I realized that I had deﬁned rather
weakly, and so did Rob. He smiled,
“You don’t mean some sort of a ‘My
country, right or wrong’ attitude", do
you? You wouldn’t suggest a blind
acceptance of everything that goes
on here?”

“No. But I'd at least make it ‘my
country, up or down!’ No honorable
son would tolerate disparagement of
his parents, whether he argued with
those parents himself or not. And
just so should a student back his
school. Criticize it while you are
here; try to better it. But don’t
mourn in public.” ’

We sat silent for a moment. “’1‘here
is not much of that spirit here,” Rob
remarked, gazing at the rafters. “Too
many persons find something wrong
with the administration, with our

athletics, with activities, with campus-

life.”
Existence And Spirit

“It is not as bad as that,” was my
reply,” but it is certainly a shame
that at_ the one time that public atten-
tion is turned toward the school, and
possibly threatens its very existence,
students should bump heads instead
of rallying to their mutual support!
Here we are at one of the major uni-
versities of the nation, with world re-
known athletic teams, famous depart-
ments of research, the finest buildings,
and students find little to glory in!”

Rob, being as patriotic as myself,
couldn’t very well challenge me. But
he smiled at my vehemence, and said,
“Just what can we do about it?” He
raised his hand and waved to a boy
passing us.

“There's plenty we can do about
“I’d like to head the
dean of men’s office for a year or two
and inject my ideas into the situation."
I wilted a little. “Of course, I can’t
say just what Dean Lanfear is doing
now. He has a lot to work with. But
I’d like to start a club or something
to foster school spirit, a club with a

power to legislate rather freely.

“The first thing to do would be
to organize every force here now
into a cooperating force. I'd get
the backing of the fraternities
and sororities and the women's
organization, and every other
group with a solid bond. l’d pro-
duce that force at the athletic
games and at the assemblies.
Why. with forty units scattered
about the student section at the
football games—and there would
really be more than forty-we
could build up a splendid cheering
section. And cheers, like songs,
always raise spirit.

“After that, the next thing would
be to organize each freshman class
and install customs. Then publicize
the movement, use propaganda and

.” Here Rob interrupted. “Hey,

wait a minute,” he protested, “accom.
ing to Igor a few days ago, you were
against men's customs, and wrote
only of the ones that had a good
time here.” He looked at me as
t11011gh I were a white sheep sudden-
ly turned black.

A Misunderstanding

“Igor,” I laughed, “was wrong.
There is no more willing advocate of
men‘s customs than myself on this
campus. The string in my case was
fastened to the idea that there must
be no hazing. Corporal punishment—-
the paddle, marches, and that sort of
thing-—for people of anything like the
age of coll-ge students is both inex-
cusable and degrading. I think that
the only place for the paddle is in a.
museum of antiquities, and that any
kind of Hell-week, be it in a frater-
nity or freshman ritual, should return
to the inferno from which it sprang.”

“And when I became a man, I set
aside childish things,” quoth Rob, and
we both laughed. “But I do think that
there. are certain things here to pre-
vent the return of customs. For in-
stance, ours is a metropolitan city.
Students are not on campus long
enough to become imbued with any
sort of school spirit.”

“As to the metropolitan idea—in
the school year 1917-18. or perhaps it
was 1918-19, during the war, you
note, the students were organized in-
to military reserves. ‘When the ﬂu
epidemic started, the campus went on
quarantine, and was able to enforce
rigid regulations on campus. VVe
could still set boundaries.”

“As to being on campus—one of
the purposes of customs would be
to enforce campus activities, and
appearance at campus affairs.
Under the sponsorship of the Y
and of the Dean's office, every
student should get into at least
one activity. And presence at the
games would not only be good for
the freshmen, but also a fine tonic
for the school spirit."

A gale of laughter came from room
1, then some applause. Rob and I
looked at each other and nodded.
Those freshmen would always have
at least this one contact with the
school. Rob picked up the conversa-
tion again. “Do you think it is pos-
sible to separate hazing and cus-
toms?” he asked.

In Temple

Battle Tonight

 

42-24 Victory Over Georgetown Quintet Keeps Panther
Team On Top Of Eastern Intercollegiate Loop

 

Coach Jimmy Usilton and a

band of determined Temple bas-

keteers troiiped into Pittsburgh this morning all set for their iin-
portant clash with an equally determined Panther cage team at the
stadium tonight, a game that ﬁnds the top honors in the Eastern In-
tercollegiate conference as the victor’s spoils.

Add to the importance of the game in conference standing the
fact that Temple quite iniexpectedly tripped the Panthers in their

first meeting at Philadelphia last
month, 45-38, and an additional rea-
son pops up as to just why the Gold-
en Cats are so anxious to_meet the
boys from Philly here tonight. It's
the old revenge motive.

As a result of their victory over
-Tecli Monday in- Philadelphia the
Owls moved a little closer to the
Panthers. who are perched on top of
the league heap at the present. The

Temple outﬁt boasts a conference
record of ﬁve games won and two
lost for a percentage of .714 while
the Panthers have bagged three of
their four conference battles giving
them a percentage of .750, just enough
to retain their lead. In the total
gaiiies to date this season Jimmy Usil-
i.on’s boys again how to the players
under Dr. Carlson: the Owls have 15
games marked in the records as wins
while ﬁve games are chalked upon
the opposite side; the Panthers claw-
ed 14 of their 18 opponents into sub-
mission

Temple’s starting lineup tonight
will find Coach Usilton playiiig a
slightly changed ﬁve from the team
tlizit defeated Pitt in the ﬁrst game.
Two seniors, Jinimy Brown and How-
ard Rcsan. will be almost certain
starters at the guard positions, both
hming ﬁne shots and good defensive
players. Rosan has been an uiiani-
mous choice for the all-conference
team for. the past two years. Stephen
Juenger, a sophomore star at the cen-
ter post. will more than likely be at
the pivot position. The forwards will
nroba.bl_v be Ernie l\'Iessi.komer and
Louis Dubin, both playing their sec-
ond year as a varsity member.

The starting lineup for the Pan-
thers will ﬁnd Coach Carlson bank-
ing on the same usual varsity unless
a last minute change is necessary.
Skippy Hughes and Teddy Roderick
at the forwards, High Pete Noon op-
posing Te1iiple’s Juenger at center,
and Claire Cribbs and Ross Emrick
at the guards will probably be the
ﬁve to rip off their sweat clothes
when the referee walks to the center
ring.

Cats Outclass H oyas

A great Panther cage team passed
and shot its way to a brilliant while
easy 42-24 win over its conference
rival Georgetown at Vfashington last
Saturday, thus keeping a step ahead
of the riinners-up for league honors,
the Temple Owls.

Assuming the lead in the early ino-
ments of the game the Panthers bag-
ged baskets from all angles of the
court to run up an overwhelming lead
at the half, 23-7. Capital City sport
writers and basketball fans claimed
afterwards that the Panther team far
surpassed any college outﬁt that play-
ed there all year, which is quite an
honor considering that New York
University, one of the country’s stand-
out teams, played in Washington re-
cently.

Ross Emrick, the Panther’s sopho-
more star, led the scoring for the eve-
ning with a total of 11 points, most of
them shot from difficult side angles.
Georgetown came in for a share of
the individual scoring spotlight, Cap-
tain Hargaden placing second with 10
points. eight of them fouls, and Joe
Gibeau only one point behind his
team mate with nine markers.

end, swampiiig Leetsdale at Leetsdale
Friday night to the tune of 47-32 and
nosing out the Penn State frosh at
the stadium Sut.urda_v in an overtime
game, 37-31. ‘With the two victories
added to their long list of victims, the
Cubs further established themselves
as one of the strongest freshman
teams in the district.

At the stadium Saturday the Pan-
thers and the Lion Cubs put up a
thrilling battle that found the score
knotted at the end of the regulation
titrne, 30-30, with Rags Radvansky, for-
mer Duquesne high star, in the hero
role. Tmiling by two points with but
30 secords left to play, Radvansky
pulled the Little Panthers out of a
tougli spot with a beautiful shot that
tied up the gains. In the extra period
the Cr.bs made short work of the
State cage team, running up seven
points while holding the Lions to one
lone tally.

The match is
Saturday evening at 7:30 o’clock.

Starting this afternoon Coach Schricker is going to put the entire squad
through light tapering-off exercises which he hopes will bring the boys right

up to the top.
Nothing is

being overlooked in training the team down to a ﬁne point

for the Badger matches.
although its team is not the best in
the Big Ten, is always among the
lea.ders in the ring sport.

The ﬁghters came out of the Tem-
ple matches last Saturday night with
a 4 to 3 victory and no injuries. The
triumph over the Owls places the Pan-
thers in a tie for the Eastern Intercol-
legiate conference championship.

Tlie_ Panthers’ 4-3 victory over the
Owls came as a result of three vic-
tories and a forfeit in the 175-pound
class.

Captain Jimmie Giannatti was in
rare forin as he scored a technical
knockout over Pettineo. Jimmie
ﬂoored his man twice for counts of
eight and nine in the second round.
After the second round the referee
stopped the bout.

Bernie Spiegal did away with his
opponent in short order. Ravjian

Sigma C-hi’s third straight victory’

scrappy five as a serious threat to
Delta Tau Delta's title hopes for two
successive championships. Sigma
Alpha Mu was victim No. 3 for these
boys, by a margin of 20-8.

Theta Chi t.urned on the pressure to
nose out Phi Gamma Delta, 21-19.
This was the Fiji's third loss in as
many attempts.

Phi Epsilon Pi’s early match with
Delta Tau Delta was postponed to a
later date.

M,cC'lain and Zinszer led in the
Sigma Chi victory with five markers
apiece. Piiisky, with five, scored all
but three of his team’s total. Two
football men, Olejnicsak and W'ojci-
hovski held up the Sigma Chi’s de-
fensive end of the game.

Women ’s Nominating Groups

To Meet ForA~Forum Friday

Qualifications Of Nominees:
For Coming Election

To Be Determined , ,
-———--—- I

Nominating committees of all wom-7
en’s organizations on campus have;
been invited to attend a meeting at;
Heinz House Friday at 12:30 o‘clock,i
in order to consider general standards f
to be adopted in the selection off
nominees for the coming spring elec-’
tion. ;
The initial step- in the election pro-,7
cedure, the selection of nominating?
committees, which was completed to-T
day, will be quickly followed by theg
Friday meeting, which has been called j
by Senior Court.

The meeting is to take the form of
a forum, with each member of Senior
Court leading a small discussion
group which will consider the type of
procedure that may be adopted and
the qualities to be looked for in pros-
pective nominees.

In calling the meeting, Mary Ger-
trude Herron, chief justice, has in-
vited fraternities whose by-laws call_
for the appointment of nominatingi
committees and whose election date
does not conﬂict with the general
Women’s elections, to participate.

One of the duties of Senior Court
is to conduct elections for all Women’s
organizations on campus. This in-
cludes ‘WSGA, the freshman, sopho-.
more, junior, and senior classes,
YWCA, VVAA, VVomen’s Debating As-
sociation, Women’s ‘Chorale, and Pan-
hellenic Association, whose nominat-
ing committees have been approved.

According to members of Senior
Court, the entire election system can
be facilitated by the various groups
adhering to the procedure outlined by
Court and reprinted at the right.

The committee of senior women who
will select nominees for senior queen,
as announced this morning by the
dean of Women’s ofﬁ-ce, includes Janet
Savage, Marjorie Reich, Frances Mc-
Laughlin, Louise Birnkrant, Muriel
Dils, and Hazel Lincoln.

 

Y Organization
To Visit‘ Common

Pleas Court, Jail

At 2:30 o’clock tomorrow afternoon
a group of University students will
cross over the “bridge of sighs” which
separates the court house and the jail
of Allegheny county.

But instead of being herded by
armed guards, the group will be led
by Dr. W'alter A. Lunden, instructor
in the department of sociology.

The occasion will not be the “last
round up,” of an underworld gang, but
merely a part of a “Cri1ne, Courts,
and Prisoners Trip” being sponsored
by the University YM, and YVVCA.

Dr. Lunden will meet interested
st.udents and members of his crim-
inology class tomorrow at the State
hall steps. The group will go imme-
diately to the Common Pleas court in
the City-County building, where they
will visit until they leave at 2:15
o’clock for the trip through the county
jail.

Following the trip, the criminology
sight-seers will gather at the Down-
town YMCA, Wood street, for a dis-
cussion of the tour. The discussion,
to be held in Room 201, will be led by
Dr. Lunden.

Vocations For Women

Eastern Conference To Discuss
‘ ‘Back-To-Kitchen’ ’ Trend

A conference on “Life careers for
women,” in New York City on March
28, 29, and 30 will focus the attention
of women student delegates upon the
occupational situation with which col-

legs and high school graduates are
faced.

Undergraduate women from east-
ern and southern colleges have been
invited to attend the conference on
worn-an’s work and their stake in pub-
lic affairs, which is to be sponsored
by the Institute of VVOmen’s Profes-
sional Relations.

One problem to be considered dur-
ing the three—day session is the
"baclt-to-the-kitclien” movement which
is threatening careers of women in
America.

Roosevelt, and Senator Robert F.
VVagner will talk on “The Job and Its

Sororities Await
Bid Acceptances
During ThisWeek

Silence Reigns While Rushees
Make Final Decisions On
Women’s Groups

()ll!)'
fraternity ballots given the rushees
must be ﬁlled out and handed in.

And today rushees of the women’s
fraternities are wandering around
campus, a lonely group of women

afraid to speak to any of their frater-
nity friends.

The reason for the sudden letdown
in the activities of the Greek organi-
zations is the declaration by Panhel-
lenic Council that no fraternity
woman may enter into conversation
with a prospective pledge. This
edict enables the rushees to make de-
cisions as to their choice of fraternity
without being inﬂuenced by campaign-
mg.

The fraternity groups ﬁnished their
work yesterday when bid lists were
sent to the ofﬁce of Miss Helen P.
Rush, assistant dean of women. The
remainder of the week is set aside
for the rushees to make their de-
cisions and ﬁll out their preferential
ballots.

The ballots must be returned to the
oflice of the dean of women by 9:30
o'clock Friday morning. These will
be checked and the list of accept-
ances for each of the social groups
on campus will be compiled privately.
The only results of the ballots which
will be made public will be the names
of those who have accepted the i11vi-
tations of the various groups.

The fraternities may call for.tl1e
names of their new 1:-ledges Friday
evening at 9 o’clock at the ~Unive.rsity
club. All pledge ribbons should be
pinned on the neophytes by 8:30
o’clock Monday morning; the formal
pledging services will take place the
same. evening.

Open bidding will extend from
March 11 until the end of the semes-
ter.

Sophomores Entertain

Mothers At Tea Today

Sophomore women will add one
more to their list of teacup juggling
parties when they entertain their
mothers at a tea today at Heinz
House from 3:30 to 5:30 o’clock.

Ruth Shapiro, C, Barbara Thomas,
BA, Audrey Graham, Ed, and Rita
Carey, C, will give ﬁve-minute talks
on why they chose the work they are
taking. Betty Vvainwright, program
cliairman, announces that Kathryn
Hardy will play the piano during the
tea.

Miss Helen P. Rush, assistant dean
of women, Miss Isabelle S. Anderson,
assistant dean of women, Miss Eliza-
beth K. Irwin, class adviser, and
Elinor Scott, president of the class,
