PPU Pushes Pitt Union Vote

History Professor Van Beck Hall,
_ PPU President

 Compromise

BY scorr MACLEOD
The Pitt" Professional Union
(PPU) pushed the University's‘

faculty one step closer to collective
bargaining recently. by notifying
the administration that the PPU
now represents 30% of the
employees in an “appropriate
unit." The “appropriate unit," as
contended by the PPU, includes
faculty in the provost’s area,
librarians, and graduate assistants.
\ Afterireceiving ofﬁcial notiﬁca-
tion by mail from the PPU, the
administration technically has 10
days to respond by choosing one of
three options listed by Pennsyl-
vania state law.

The letter, mailed by PPU June
11, was received by the adminis-
tration last week. Director of

English Tenure Cases

BY TOM SMITH H

A compromise on the tenure
decisions of three English de-
partment faculty members’ orig-
inally expected sometime in June
will not be reached until fall,
probablyin September, the Pitt
News has learned. _

The three faculty members,
Christopher Rawson, Mary Bris-
coe. and Ronald Curran were
denied tenure in late April by FAS
Dean Rosenberg after receiving
strong tenure recommendations
from the department.

A rift developed between the
department and the dean with
chairman Rober_t B. Hinman
threatening to resign unless the
decisions to deny tenure to Rawson
and postpone the tenure of Briscoe
and Curran are either reversed or
modified by Rosenberg. Hinman
has been in consultation with
Rosenberg to achieve a compro-
misc.

By postponing the decision until

" September the department will be
better able to pressure Rosenberg
into accepting a decision favorable
to ‘the department according to
several sources. Due to the
absence of students, faculty, and
administrators during the spring
and summer sessions the depart-
ment would be better able to reach
a favorable agreemen\t if they
“push the issue” in the fall the
sources said.

The passing of time also would
make it easier for Rosenberg to
reverse or modify his original
. decision._ In this way according to
sources.iit would not seem as if

department.
No agreement h‘as yet been
reached and according to sources

withinthe department, “Nothing is’

going to happen right away."
Earlier this month the negotia-
tions reportedly “were at a very

. sensitive stage."

.Hinman scheduled a meeting of

the department faculty on June 5 at .

which the tenure cases of the three
candidates were discussed. The
meeting was closed to the press.
The Pitt News has learned
Hinman informed the department
faculty of a compromise offered by
Rosenberg. The compromise was
unspeciﬁc and “very general.“
Hinman was originally seeking a

The appointment of a new dean
for the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs (GSPIA)
was announced yesterday by
University Provost Rhoten A.

Smith. The new dean is John
Funari. Ford Foundation repre-
sentative for Mexico. Central

America andithe Caribbean and
former official of the US State
Department's Agency for. Inter-
national Development (AID). “
“In”-light of Mr. Funari's
previous record at—Pitt, and his

 

   

within the next few days.

In its letter to the administration,
the PPU states that it has now
received “authorization cards”
from 30% of the members of an
“appropriate unit,”--a group of
University employees that the PPU
considers have a community of
interest. The collection of these
authorization cards signifies that
30% of the proposed unit has
expressed interest in having the
PPU represent them for collective
bargaining purposes. Thirty per
cent of the group is the percentage
required by law before an
organization such as the PPU can
ask that a bargaining unit be
named. i

In effect, the PPU’s letter to the
administration asks that they
respond in one of three ways, all of
which could lead to the naming of a
bargaining agent for the appropri-
ate bargaining unit. ‘

First, the administration can
agree with the PPU’s designation
If the
administration concurs, they can
also agree that the PPU should be
the bargaining agent named to
represent the “appropriate unit,”
provided that the PPU can produce
authorization cards for over 50% of
the unit's members.

Secondly, the administration‘ can
agree that the faculty under the

provost’s area, librarians and H.

graduate assistants are indeed an
“appropriate unit” with a com-
munity of interest, but disagree
that the PPU is necessarily the
representative of the group. In this

"instance, the Pennsylvania Labor

Relations Board [PLRB] would
conduct an election among inter-
ested‘ organizations which would
compete to represent the “appro-
priate unit.” At Pitt, presently
three organizations are vying for

where, we are conﬁdent that the
School (GSPIA) will be in ex-
ceedingly good hands.

“We expect real progress in its
development and its programs
under his leadership," Smith said.

Funari has been with the -Ford
Foundation since 1970, and was
responsible for formulating and

SG—Pitt News Contract   

i:.‘.:‘:...?:.:‘3....3:S:ﬁ::‘;:y..‘“.:‘....Ei‘..i Negotiations Deadlocked

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Contract renewal discussed be-
tween the Pitt News and Student
Government are deadlocked after
more than three weeks of nego-
tiations among Pitt" News repre-
sentatives, the SG Allocations
Committee, and the Student
Government Board.

The present contract agreed
upon two years ago expires on June
30. It allows the Pitt News to
operate outside the financial
guidelines which regulate all other
student organizations. Thus far,
SGAC has submitted two alterna-
tive contracts which place some
ﬁnancial controls over the Pitt
News--both vehemently opposed
by the paper’s Editor-in-Chief,
Scott MacLeod who calls the
proposals -“a threat to freedom of
the press."

“The Pitt News shouldn’t
operate under Student Govern-
ment’s guidelines because it’s a
special organization,” says
MacLeod. “We’re the only
campus organization that is also a
paper. The present contract is
good because it insures our
necessary freedom, for both the_
office operation and what we put

Rosenberg about-face

into print.” A

The Pitt News has also submitted
two contracts--neither was wholly ‘

acceptable to the SGAC which fears

absolute freedom of the Pitt News  4
will lead only to further _mis-, if

handling of funds within the

business ofﬁce.

“Because the Pitt News is at _

be allowed to spend money where

tained SGAC member Bill Barker.

“With its problems in internal "

auditing, a lot of student funds ‘

could be misused. We just want to

make sure that these funds are not‘ ‘

wasted.” '

Barker also emphasized the Pitt
News’s reliance on SG for
recognition and funding, and said
the paper should be accountable to
it under the guidelines for student
organizations.

“Student Government would

only control some of the ﬁnancial
allocations of the paper. We would

in no way attempt to inhibit itsjjiii iii‘;

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

The Supreme Court ruled Tues-
day that states cannot compel
_,; ( newspapers to .give free space to
S ‘  political candidates for the purpose
A - of responding to editorial criticism.

Backed by a 60 year old statute,
Pat Tornillo, an unsuccessful
candidate for the Florida legisla-
ture, demanded the Miami Herald
print his replies to the newspaper's
'' editorial criticism, leveled. against
“him during the campaign.

Tornillo, under the 1913 Florida
statute, sued the newspaper to
force it to print his statements.
1 Failing to comply with the law was
3 considered a misdemeanor of the
ﬁrst degree, punishable by up to
 3 one year in prison and a $1000 ﬁne.
Specifically, the law states that a
newspaper assailing the personal
' character or public record of a
ti candidate" for nomination or elec-
tion, must provide free space to
that candidate if he wants to write
a reply.

’ - After the law was upheld in the
Florida courts, the Herald forced
the case to the Supreme Court,

where it was presented April 16.

Six days later, William Shane

(D-Indiana) introduced into the

Pennsylvania House a bill prac-
ticallygidentical in principle to the

Florida statute.

Chief Justice Warren Berger
wrote the opinion for the unan-
imous court reversing the Florida
.law, which has been invoked once
before, Associate Justices William
. Brennan, with William Rehnquist

joining, and Myron White‘ wrote
concurring opinions.

George Washington University
Law Professor Jerome Barron, who
argued Tornillo's case before the

_high ‘court, said yesterday the
decision places a greater respon-
sibility on journalists to be fair and
objective. -

“This decision gives the press
larger immunity from the law than
ever before in our history," Barron
said. This new immunity should
imposeta new sense of obligation
on the press to give everybody
their day in the court of public
opinion.”

“Those who are unpopular in the
community are at the mercy of the
collective conscience of the press,”
Barron added.

In Washington. two prominent
editors expressed satisfaction at
the court's decision, explaining it is
clearly a victory for press freedom.

“l sure do," said Washington
Post executive editor Benjamin
Bradlee,_ when asked whether he
thought the case was a First
Amendment issue. “When you
have a government telling you what
you must print, it's only a short

step away from telling you what

you cannot print."

Bradlee said he did not know
what he would do if the were
confronted with the Miami Her-
ald's situation. “l’ve got so many
problems with the newspaper
business, here is one I guess I
won't have to deal with,” Bradlee
concluded. b

this position. They are the PPU,
the American Association of
University Professors [AAUP], and
the Pennsylvania State Educational
Association [PSEA].

Finally, the administration can
deny that the PPU has an accurate
definition of an “appropriate
unit.” The administration could
contend that certain groups have
been wrongly included or excluded"
in the PPU’s definition of the unit.

If the PPU and the administra-
tion could not agree on the
definition of an “appropriate
unit,-" then the PLRB would
conduct hearings, taking testi-
mony, to determine in Pitt’s case,
of what an appropriate unit
consists. -—

Once this is decided, an election
can be held if one of the competing

' organizations can produce author-

ization cards .from 30% " of i the
members of the “appropriate unit”
as decided by the PLRB.

When the faculty votes, either of

‘ the three organizations could be

elected bargaining agent, or no
union can be voted, by a majority
vote. In case no position receivesa
majority, a run-off is held between
the top two contenders.

“There is really no decision to
make here,". Hannan said of the
options the administration has to
consider. He explained that the
administration would not agree
with the PPU’s definition of the
“appropriate unit” and in addition,
that the PPU should not be

considered the indisputable. rep-

resentative ‘of the “appropriate
wunit." , A

“We will let it go to a hearing,”

WE’VE GOT WHAT

YOU NEED!

Hannan said, opting for the PLRB
to make a decision on the
“appropriate unit.”-

“We 'are not going to certify
them because we are faced with
two other unions," he said.

“And we would differ with them
on what is the “appropriate unit.”
We contend that it is all full-time
faculty of the University.

Hannan explained that the
administration considers all the
faculty in the health related
professions to have a community of
interest with all other full-time
faculty. “We feel that the faculty
is the faculty,” he said.

“We would also exclude all the
TA's and TF’s,” Hannan con-
tinued. “You take a graduate
student working on his masters and
a full time faculty member who has
been here for 20 years, they are
obviously not in the same position.

“Then our position is to let the *

board (PLRB) decide on the
“appropriate unit," and if one or
more of the agents qualify, then
they can call for election.”
History professor Van Beck Hall,
president of PPU said the

_administration would not agree
with the PPU’s definition of an .

“appropriate unit,” for tactical
reasons.

,“They have the suspicion that if
we go with this (appropriate unit)
we can’ win,” Hall said. As a
matter of strategy, Hall added, the
administration would probably add
and subtract groups from their
proposed unit, in order to have the
PLRB conduct a hearing to decide
the matter. ,

Pitt faculty to unionize. At other
universities, such as Temple, a
principle motivation for unionizing
is layoffs and delayed payhikes.

“Looking into the future it
doesn’t look very good,” Hall said.
“Forming a union is the only way
that we can essentially protect
ourselves.”

In addition, Hall said it is in the
best interests of the university to
form a union now, while both sides
still maintain a degree of flexibility.

Unions can promise, but not
necessarily deliver cost of living
increments, fairer salary scales,
and faculty control of tenure
decisions, promotions, and ap-
pointments, Hall contends.

Conceding that a union could
produce either “afrigid hostility or
a love-hate relationship,” between
the faculty, and administration, Hall
concludes that ‘if the union is
brought in quickly, a good
relationship could develop.

“The longer you wait,” Hall
said, “the more problems (between
the .two groups) are going to build
up.” .

preserve the integrity of the
department to make tenure de-
cisions. The department objects to
Dean’s use of ad hoc
committees composed of faculty
members outside the department
inquestion for advice on tenure
decisions. '

The plan discussed at the June 5
meeting reportedly would not have
dealt with this issue. Of particular
concern to the department accord-
ing to Pitt News sources is that of
the seven candidates eligible for
tenure next year three will not have
published,. the same situation

which, according to inside sources,
i brought about Rawson’s tenure

rejection.

Sources add, though, that
Rosenberg, in keeping the nego-
tiations open with the _English
department, is being responsive to
their demands that he modify or
reverse his original‘ decision.

 

 

negotiations occured another
‘meeting of the department would
be called. There has been no
meeting since June 5, nor has there
been any notiﬁcation of a meeting
for the future.

The department, as reported in
the Pitt News May 30, has been
reluctant to discuss this matter for
fear publicity would damage the

chances of the decisions being“

either reversed org modiﬁed. An
English department teaching as-
sistant refused to comment on the
situation for fear of “being socially
ostracized.“ . '
According ‘to Rosenberg his
position is not ‘to comment on
speciﬁc tenure cases, but he has
said earlier this month such
publicity would not affect his
decision. According to sources the
FAS Dean is also “very sensitive to
confidentiality" in tenure cases.’

Daniel said he would probably go
to jail rather than be forced by law
to print a political can_didate’s reply
to an editorial.

“I’m not very happy to go to
jail,” Daniel said. “But if that’s
what you have to do to uphold the
free press, th‘en‘that’s what you
have to do.”

‘Representative Shane’s House
Bill 2186 differs slightly from the
Florida law in substance. While
both are election laws dealing
primarily with editorial criticism
duringcampaigns, Shane’s in-
cludes a clause allowing for public
office holders in non election
circumstances to take advantage of
a ‘_‘right to reply.”

The Pennsylvania bill also
specifies the criticism must be a
charge of “unethical conduct,”
whereas the Florida law, now held

Shane did not view the “right to

expansion of the medium for free
expression.

“More and more towns have one
newspaper monopolizing public

the access to the media of the

Defen din g as Free Press

Using the term fiscal irresponsibility. the Student Government

=iAllocation Committee and the Student Government Board are seeking

to place The Pitt News under the°financial controls of Student Govern-

'~ ment, threatening the newspaper’s operations and more significantly.
‘ dangerous posing a threat to The Pitt News’ inherent right of press

- freedom. -

Advertising and circulation revenue is not sufficient to balance

-the newspaper’s annual budget of nearly $120.000. The Pitt News de-

pends on subsidies from the administration and Student Government as

A do many college newspapers throughout the country.

The paper has been operating under a contract with Student Gov-
ernment for the last two years. Under the terms of the contract The

. 'Pitt'News isynot subject to the normal budgetary controls imposed on .

other student organizations.

Because it is a newspaper The Pitt News has not beenconsidered
a, normal student organization. Its mission as a student organization
—-the dissemination _of news and the guiding of public opinion—is unique

I and because of this The Pitt News has been divorced from the editorial
' and budgetary controls of Student Government: '

An additional purpose of the contract was to avert the annual flare-

‘up occurring when The Pitt News submits its budget request to the Al-

locations Committee. Administrators who served as the catalysts for
I the first contract maintain the motivation behind the contract notion
' was to put an end to the “habitual antagonism” between the two groups.

Regressing from the original concepts of the contract. which rec-

A. ognized a newspaper’s inherent rights. the Allocations Committee has

proposed an alternative contract which would allow Student Govern-

' . ment to control specific items in The Pitt News’ budget.

The proposal is acceptable. according to the committee. because

 .' it simply prohibits The Pitt News from spending money in areas for
A . which other student organizations are not permitted to expend funds.

Because they are not telling The Pitt News what to print but only how
to spend money. the committee maintains this is not a free press issue.

The present contract. which does not expire until June 30 did not
absolve the paper from adhering to allocations guidelines accidental-

5 ly. It implicity states that The Pitt News must no't be subject to control
: h of any kind by a studentgovernment. The clause was designed in‘rec-

ognition of the principle which guarantees free expression in this na-
tion. ,

The Pitt News inherent rightto press freedom is constant and will
not change until the newspaper ceases to be a newspaper. The Pitt
News cannot accept a contract whereby a student goyernment can
control items in its budget. This would be improper for two_ specific
reasons.

_,/ First. it obviously would be unfair to The Pitt News as a newspa-

I 7 per to have its budget items decided by student government. which can
and often does come under its editorial criticism.

The Pitt News does not claim any special right to exist nor any
right to be supported financially by Student Government. We do. how-
ever. insist that only members of the newspaper staff ,have. the right

and qualifications to make decisions affecting the newspaper. both edi-

torially and monetarily. .
We agree The Pitt News cannot be permitted to abuse student

. activities funds. The original contract had many safeguards for the

protection of large sums of money which fund The Pitt News opera-
tions. The second contract submitted to the committee contained addi-

R tional safeguards. remedying potential problems with the first con-

tract which concerned the Allocations Committee.
Furthermore. like other student organizations The Pitt. News is

_vulnerable to the careful scrutiny of the Office of Student Affairs and

Student Activities.

At issue. then. is not fiscal irresponsibility. Measures to insure
fiscal responsibility have been taken willingly by the newspaper in re-
sponse to requests by the Internal Audit Department of the University
and not the Student Government Allocations Committee.

At issue is Student Government’s authority to control the finances
of the newspaper.

Secondly. it would be improper for The Pitt News to accept the Al-

-location,Committee’s proposal because it contains a list of restric-

tions. This list could easily grow from year to year. The newspaper
would be at the mercy of the whims of each and every particular Stu-
dent Government.

Inhibiting its growth and its ability to achieve a full potential. the

_ newspaper would be inflicted with a malignancy if the proposal were

accepted. Instead of allowing The Pitt News the proper freedoms and

facilitating conditions in which the paper could expand and progress.
the proposed contract would strangle The Pitt News operations year

after year. producing a less than adequate service to readers in the
University community and journalism students.

If The Pitt News must adhere to the financial guidelines of the Al-

.l0cations Committee. it will be continually subject to any new rules a

student government might deem is in the interests of making the best
use of the activities fee monies.

Just last fall. for example. the Allocations Committee drafted a
"Publishers Rights Proposal.” as an addition to the by-laws govern-
ing the operations of the committee. which stated that the Allocations
Committee was the publisher of all student publications. including
The Pitt News. Essentially. the committee is implementing the tenets
of that proposal even thoughit was withdrawn last November.

. The right of press freedom is not a safeguard against threats to a
free press.

Though considered today to be guaranteed by the First Amend-
ment. the free press in America was an evolutionary process. Histori-

cally. the _concept of freedom of the press began its development long-

before the Revolutionary War." Today it is still a concept which is nei-
ther absolute nor unchallenged. '

  

 

A dream revitalized

Seeking Bobby's Newer World

BY TOM SMITH

“Our future may lie beyond our
vision, but it is not completely
beyond our control. It is the
shaping impulse of America that
neither fate nor nature nor the
irresistable tides of history, but the
work of our own hands, matched to
reason and principle, that will
determine destiny. There is pride
in that, even arrogance, but there
is also experience and truth. In any
event it is the only way we can
live."

Robert F. Kennedy’s life mir-
rored his ‘own words. With his
hands--with his life--he tried to
make Americans realize they could
control their destiny by laying the
foundation on which future gener-
ations could build. His ideal world
was one free of_ hatred and
abundant with opportunity.

More than anything this moti-
vated his ill-fated crusade for the

Presidency in 1968. Thatcrusade .

and the dreams and the hopes for
America voiced along that primary
route ended when Robert Kennedy
died of «gunshot wounds in Los
Angeles six years ago.

Though one man may have
pulled the trigger, his sickness was
indicative of the society in which he
lived--a misdirected society seek-
ing permanent solutions to prob-
lems which seemed to have no

solutions.

The year 1968 had already been a
year of sorrow, devastation, and
chaos. American cities were in
flames. Those ‘who morally
objected to American involvement
in Southeast Asia cried out to be
heard'by their government.

Minnesota Senator Eugene Mc-
Carthy responded to the pleas for
change and challenged /President
Lyndon Johnson for the Democratic

nomination. McCarthy’s respect-
able showing in the New Hamp-
shire primary shocked both a party
and a people.

Robert Kennedy announced his
candidacy for the nomination,
though many criticized him for
entering the race after McCarthy's
victory. Shortly afterward, on
March 31, Lyndon Johnson an-
nounced he would not seek the
Presidential nomination again. A

[war had ended a career and the‘

world -appeared on the brink of
change. .

In head to "head primary battles
Kennedy defeated McCarthy in
Indiana,. Nebraska,
Dakota, but he suffered the
family's first electoral defeat in the
Oregon primary.

While campaigning in Indiana
the problems which plagued
America became tragically evident.

Martin Luther King was assassin-
ated in Memphis and Kennedy
broke the news to a black audience
in Indianapolis as he said, “We will
have difficult times in the future. It
is not the end of violence. It is not
the end of lawlessness. It is not the
end of disorder.”

And the scene shifted to Los
Angeles as" Kennedy added yet
another primary win to his
triumphs. In a victory speechhe
spoke of his hope for America--his
dream of what it meant for this
nation to seek a‘ rebirth of mission.

That night Kennedy said, “I
think all these ‘primaries have
indicated it is quite clear that we
can work together in the last‘
analysis and that what has been
going on the last three years--the
divisidns, violence, disenchant-
ment with society between black
and white, poor and affluent can be

SCOTT MACLEOD, Editor-in-Chief

MICHAEL CLINTON and AMY ELLER
Business Managers

Freedom of the press has developed out of a tradition of editors‘

. dedictation to preserving their r_ights to publish freely.

Over 200 years ago in this country. editors were fighting and going
to jail for the right to publish something without first obtaining a gov-
ernment license. Eventually. by law. they obtained that right.

The Supreme Court only yesterday ruled unconstitutional a Florida
law which required newspapers to print replies of candidates editorial-

ly assailed by a newspaper.

Editors in both cases demanded their right to print free from com-
pulsion. requirement. and license. Many _philosophers ‘consider this
principle a safeguard against tyranny in a democracy.

It is the responsibility of every editor and every newspaper.
whether The New York Times or The Pitt "News, to insure that free-
dom of the press is neither weakened or damaged.

The Pitt News cannot accept this proposed contract for these rea-
sons and because of these considerations.

Student Government should not persist in their efforts to place
The Pitt News under its budgetary controls. The Board must direct its
attention to the free press issues discussed in this editorial. Only in
this way can a solution be found to this problem.

The operations of the paper could be impaired if the subsidy of Stu-
dent Government is jeopardized. In effect. students will be denied a
service by Student Government representatives elected by only one-

sixth of The Pitt News circulation.

It is time for the Board to direct its attention to the interests of the
students. The Pitt News will not accept any proposal which it consi-
ders a violation of its rights to a free press. and only with the realiza-
tion of this concept as an issue in these negotiations. can any com-

promise be reached.

 

 

and South _ _
‘ was hisability to inspire a troubled

healed.”

[L

In a hotel kitchen hallway the J

lawlessness, the disorder,
violence and the death again struck

‘ and haunted a nation. The terror

which began in the shadows of
victory ended one Saturday night in
Arlington at a gravesite lit by
candles after a seemingly endless
journey by train from New York

a City.

Another dream had vanished and
hope for America had dissipated
once again in the death of a man
who accepted the quixotic chal-
lenge to right the many wrongs of
the country. ‘

Kennedy’s greatest attribute

nation. “Only those who dare to
fail greatly can ever achieve
greatly,” he said. By living his life
as he did he passed the torch to

~ another generation and demanded

they also dare to achieve-to seek a

' newer world.

In the six years since his death
American society has changed
indeed. We have lived through
Kent State, My.Lai, an endless

Asian war, inﬂation and economic -

controls, an energy crisis, and
Nixon, Mitchell,. Haldeman, Er-
lichmann, Colson, Dean, and
Agnew. It is no wonder a web of
cynicism has entangled the Amer-
ican -people. _

No longer do Americans work to

the -

end oppression, poverty, and '

inequality. .No longer do. the
institutions of government or those
serving in government offer hope
or encourage solutions to the
nation's great social problems,
which have not changed over the
years- And no longer do
Americans have respect for those
institutions. -

Kennedy took pride in pointing
out so manygtimes that one man can
change the world. He cited Martin
Luther, Joan of Arc, Christopher
Columbus, and Thomas Jefferson
as examples of those who had
“movedhthe world."

He once said, “Each. of us can

work to change a small portion of "

events and in the total of those acts

‘.4

will be written history of this '

generation. Each time a man
stands up for an ideal he sends
forth a tiny ripple of hope, and
those ripples build a current that
sweeps down the mightiest walls of
oppression and resistance.”

He summarized his own ideals
best when he said, “Some men see
things as they are and say why. I

dream things that never were and i

say- why not.” I

Now, each of us is obliged to
seize the opportunity to revitalize
Kennedy’s dream. Simply, what is
needed is a rebirth of idealism and
a realization of America’s poten-
tial. In our hands lies the ability to
shape America, to control our
destiny, and to move the world.

In the span of six years
Americans have been searching
unsuccessfully for the hope and the
promises Bobby Kennedy once
offered the nation. No one fulﬁlled
the need, and the -foundation of the
United States-'-its democratic insti-
tutions--cracked.

If Americans can rededicate
themselves to the principles‘ and
the ideals voiced those six long
years ago, Robert F. Kennedy will

be alive and no longer will there be ,

a need to search for the man, the
crusade, or the heart of the nation.

list of budgetary controls from
“growing like a cancer on the Pitt
News in the years to come.”

“Newspapers should always
have the right to press freedom,
regardless of the particular phil-
osophy of a particular SGB,” he
said in an address before a meeting
with SGA. “A list which has the
opportunity to grow, would not be
fair or just to the Pitt News in terms
of future prosperity.” 

SG President Mike F urick argues
MacLeod is unduly alarmed. He is
in favor of placing the Pitt News
under ﬁnancial controls solely
because of the findings of the
internal audit.

“The guidelines Student Gov-
ernment places over organizations
would in no way, shape, or form
inhibit the freedom of the Pitt
News. These guidelines merely
insure that the students’ activities
fees are not abused,” says Furick.

“The internal audit proves that the _

present system is incapable of
handling the Pitt News’ ﬁnances
properly.”

- Furick admits the financial
control of the guidelines could
place SG in a position of indirect
control over what the paper prints,
but he also says the Pitt News could

“The Pitt News is definitely a
special organization,.” Meloro said.
“Its members are paid, some are
even salaried and it has to rely on
Student Government for ﬁnancial
support. As long as it receives this
support, Student Government will
want to make sure the money is

rrturally views this as an attempt
to control by Student Government.
Both sides have a good argument.”

of the proposal has yet been offered

New Dorm Lite Liaison
Assumes Duties July 8 A  

BY RITA VITOLO

Pitt’s new Residence Life Coor-
dinator, Fred R. Fonseca, has been
named to replace Marian E. Hirst
as Student Affairs liaison for 3500
dorm students beginning July 8.

Hirst has held the post of
Coordinator since the program was
initiated by the Office of Student
Affairs two years ago. She will be
returning to Duquesne University
as Assistant Dean of Students for
Residence Life. ,

The Joliet, Ill. native, most
recently a residence hall adminis-
trator and executive assistant to
housing supervising over 1500
students at Illinois State University
at Normal, comes to Pitt with‘ four
years‘ experience in resident
student affairs at all levels from
resident assistant to area manager.

Fonseca was chosen from six
other candidates after a series of
interviews with Head Residents,
Resident Assistants (RA’s) and
Student Affairs personnel includ-
ing Vice Chancellor Alfred L.
Moye. According to Student
Affairs executive assistant Gary
Houston, they were seeking a
candidate with “solid residence
hall experience, particularly in its
programming aspects."

Residence hall living at Pitt is
divided into two sectors: the

Hirst said of her two years as 

‘‘I think I've laid a

to the traditional dorm styles. They
include French, and Spanish cul-

CHICAGO AP-—Ed Kranepool’s
first home run of the season, a
three-run shot, backed Jerry
Koosman's four-hit pitching and
helped the New York Mets to a 5-1
victory over the Chicago Cubs
Tuesday.

Kranspool’s homer came with
two out in the third inning
following a single by Jerry Grote
and a walk to Rusty Staub.

Victim of the blast was Cubs

starter Rick Reuschel, who also was
touched for a run in the second
inning on successive singles by
Ken Boswell, Don Hahn and Ted
Martinez.
‘ The Mets also scored in the ninth
when Staub doubled off reliever
Burt Hooton. scoring Cleon Jones
who had singled.

Koosman, 8-4, had a three-hit
shutout until Rick Monday
homered with two out in the sixth
inning.

MONTREAL AP--Steve Renko
pitched a one-hitter Tuesday night,
and Bob Bailey hit a grand-slam
home run to highlight a five-run
sixth inning that carried the
Montreal Expos to a 5-0 victory
over the Phillies. '

Benko, 5-7, struck out three,
walked five and threw two wild
pitches en route to his first victory
since June 10.

Larry Llntz started the Expos’
sixth-inning outburst with a single,
moved to third on Willie Davis’
single. After Ken Singleton struck
out, Ron Fairly walked to set the
stage for Bailey’s grand-slammer.
He belted a 2-2 pitch into the left
field bleachers off Dick Ruthven,
2-6.

A walk to Barry Foote and

, Renko’s single chased Ruthvan and
reliever Frank Linzy was greeted
by Ron Hunt's runscoring single.

WIMBLEDON, England AP--
Billie Jean King took her first step
toward a sixth women's title, and
Wimbledon rocked with cheers for
an old favorite from Australia
Tuesday in the All-England Tennis
Championships.

It was another big day for
Americans as US women ‘scored
heavily, while Jimmy Connors and
Arthur Ashe joined teammate Stan
Smith as dangerous factors in the
men's division. .

Among the men, however, there
was no salute to match that for
39-year-old Ken Rosewall, who
made his debut here as a
17-year-old in 1952, three times in
the past two decades battled his
way to the ﬁnal without ever
winning and sat out his greatest

years because he was a profes-'

sional-—the best in the world.

The 150-pound veteran from
Sydney, whose backhand is still the
most devastating in the’ game,
defeated lndia’s brilliant Vijay
Amritraj for his second victory in
two days. The score was 6-2, 5-7,
9-8, 6-1 and put Rosewall in the

' third round.

Billie Jean, making her first

minutes to polish off 18-year-old

ST. LOUIS AP--Mike Tyson
doubled home the tying run, and

' Lou Brock singled in the winning

run in the eighth inning to

-overcome a four-run Pittsburgh

ﬂurry in the top of the inning,
giving the St.’Louis Cardinals and
8-7 victory over the‘ Pirates
Tuesday night.

Reliever Daryl Patterson started

the eighth for Pittsburgh and was

tagged for Jack Heidemarin’s
leadoff single and Tyson’s double
to left. After Ted Sizemore beat
out a single to short, Ramon
Hernandez came in for the Pirates.

Brock greeted the Pirates re-
liever with a single to right for the
winning run.

Al Oliver, who had knocked in
three earlier runs, capped the four

run Pittsburgh outburst in the top-

of the eighth, wiping out a 6-3
Cardinals lead with an RBI double.

St. Louis had forged its 6-3 lead
on a three-run uprising in the
seventh on Ted Simmons’s RBI
double and Joe Torre's two-run

' single.

The Cardinals got on the

scoreboard early with an unearned_

run in the first and two more runs
in the third on Simmons’ two-run
homer, his ninth of the year.
Pittsburgh battled back on
Oliver’s run-scoring single in the
third and tied the game 3-3 on
Oliver’s two-run double in the ﬁfth.

The Cardinals went
eighth protecting a three-run lead.

But Orlando Pena, who relieved

Baltimore hurler Mike Cuellar’s

Lolich, the portly left-hander,
struck out nine and allowed seven

10-7. He has,won five in a row.

Designated hitter Al Kaline

Cuellar than yielded a ground

walked both Aurelio Rodriquez and

After disputing the call on one of

home plate umpire Russ Goetz.

Lolich left two Baltimore runners

a fouled pop in the sixth with
runners at second and third.

Asked if he thought there was
any possibility of a breakthrough
which might at least prompt. a
postponement of the July 1 strike
deadline, Ed: Garvey, director of
the ‘players association, replied
“No, I'm rather pessimistic about
that. '.

“If they were really trying to
bargain, they would have been
here last week. There's been no
indication they would make an offer
we can discuss.’_'

Even if the owners were to make
some concessions, said Garvey, it
is unlikely that the players would“
withdraw the strike threat without
an over-all agreement. “We’re not
going to fall for a carrot and stick
type of bargaining,” he said.

Searce scheduled meetings for
Wednesday and Thursday, and
said he would attempt to keep the
two sides together thro_ugh the
weekend if there were any hope for
resolving the dispute. '

The intransigence which has

,marked the contract battle since

the players drew up their demands
last March -was reflected by the
failure of several key members of
their negotiating team to attend the
latest round of talks. ’

Geronimo, troubled by a shoul-

26-year-old native of the Dominican
Republic, who was hitting .340
prior to Tuesday night’s game

it’s no surprise.

“I have the confidence. lt’s just

HARRISBURG AP--A bill
intended to preserve harness
racing at Pocono Downs in Luzerne

Tuesday, 183-4., and was sent to the

The measure would require that

There will be four games

Netherlands will play Argentina at

East Germany -at Hannover. In
Group B, it will be Yugoslavia
against West Germany at Dues-

den at Stuttgart.

The West Germans have said
they intend to play a defensive
game against Yugoslavia.

This followed widespread criti-
cism of West Germany's open
attacking style, which has brought

end Charles Waddell of Southern
Pines, NC, linebacker Jimmy
DeRatt of Stantonsburg, NC, and
defensive tackle Ronnie Robinson
of Burlington, NC.

DeRatt made all-Atlantic Coast

year last fall and Waddell was a
first-time choice. Huff, a powerful
blocker who weighs 250 and stands

history. Robinson, 6-1 and ‘250, is a
fierce attacker on the Carolina
defense.

The Tar Heels have nine starters
returning from 1973, six on the
defense and three on offense. In
addition to Huff and Waddell. the
returning offensive starter is
,fullback Dickie Oliver. He is a
two—year veteran and was a hero of
Carolina's Sun Bowl victory over
Texas Tech in 1972.

The defensive starters returning
are Robinson, DeRatt, ends Ted
Elkins and Tom Embrey, line-
backer Mark DiCarlo who has been
injured, and defensive back Russ
Conley.

The Carolina offensive team
again should be highly explosive
despite the loss of star quarterback
Nick Vidnovic. Billy Paschall. who
filled in so capably last fall when
Vidnovic was injured. is back and
raring to go. So is Chris Kupec,
another quarterback who was
sidelined by an injury last season.
They should battle for the starting
job.

Paschall hit 65 of 116 passes last
season for 837 yards and seven
touchdowns. He also is a shifty
runner and scored three touch-
downs. Kupec saw action in only
one game before being sidelined.

Three rising sdphomores who are
quarterback candidates are Johnny
Stratton, Carl Hoffman and Bobby

scored three touchdowns.

Vitek. All, however, have missed
important work in spring practice
because of injuries. ‘

Adding punch to the backfield
will be wingback Jimmy Jerome,
the team’s leading pass catcher last
fall with 24 receptions; and a
couple of fine tailbacks, James
[Boom Boom] Betterson and Mike
Voight.

Betterson was the chief backup
toithe graduated Sammy Johnson
last fall. He rushed for 414 yards,
averaging five yards a carry, and
Voight
came into his own late in the season
and rushed for 286 yards,
averaging 5.7 a carry. A problem
could develop in the offensive line
where five of seven starters
graduated. '

Carolina yielded an average of 24
points a game last season and it is
on defense that the team must
make the biggest improvement.

Robinson and DeRatt should
provide a lot of spark. but there are
some key losses. graduating

players like tackle Peter Talty.
linebackers Terry Taylor and Steve
Early and defensive backs Phil
Lamm and Earl Chesson.

The Carolina schedule is ex-
tremely rugged. In addition to the
tough tests against ACC foes. the
Tar Heels face outsiders Pitts-
