Center improves emergency care

By Mark Merlin

For The Pitt News

Pittsburgh is currently the only
city in the country where emer-
gency physicians respond to
emergencies in the streets.

Dr. Paul Paris, medical director
for the city of Pittsburgh and The

‘ Center for Emergency Medicine,

said ”The Center is an institute of
the future that is able to combine
clinical care, research and educa-
tion — blending together — that
they should improve patient
care.”

Paris said that the Center em-
ploys 24 emergency medicine
residents who travel to the scene
of a patient in any critical health
condition. Approximately 20

by the Center, provide assistance
over radio and telephone to resi-
dents when necessary.

Paris said that there are 70 such
programs in the country; Pitts-
burgh is ranked in the top three.

Tracy Kniess,— an emergency
department nurse at Presbyterian
University Hospital, believes that
the residency program, estab-
lished in 1981, is having a posi-
tive influence in the hospital.

”With the doctors working
both at the Center and in the
hospital, it keeps us more abreast
of the things [new medical
devices] that they are trying in the
field," she said.

According to Paris, training at
all levels is conducted at the
Center. "From lay public to phy-

medical students, nurses, para-
medics and emergency medical
technicians, as well as holding
post-graduate programs."

Paris said many of the tech-
niques being taught in these
courses are created or refined by
the Center, as research is one of
its primary concerns.

”We probably do more pre-
hospital care research than any-
where in the world,” said Paris.

Courses offered at the Center
include topics ranging from Ad-
vanced Trauma Life Support to
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.
Also, new programs, consisting of
a series of '10 to 20 videos called
Street Medicine, are offered for
EMTs and paramedics.

Paris praised a recently deve-

Olympics as the fundraising
recipient for Pitt's 1989 Greek
Week. A

According to Greek Week
overall co—chairman Ron Bizick,
”Of 14 foundations which solicit-
ed our assistance, five were inter-
viewed, and they showed us
around. The Special Olympics
was chosen as their Project~Out-
reach as a model for the rest of
the nation.”

Bizick said that the goals of
Project Outreachinclude recruit-
ing at least 1000 learning disa-
bled athletes and targeting their

programs for expansion in Al-
legheny county and the four sur-
rounding counties, as well as the
rest of the state. Presently, there
are 32 Special Olympic training
sites in western Pennsylvania, the
majority of them in Allegheny

Pittsburgh City Council Acting
President Ben Woods said he for-
sees no problems in assuming the
responsibilities of his new po-
sition.

Woods was m_ade acting presi-
dent by a 5-1 vote of Council on
Monday. Michelle Madoff voted
against the motion, and Mark Pol-
lock and Michael Coyne ab-
stained.

”There was never any Conflict
as to who should become presi-
dent,” Woods said. ”There was
some question as to whether I just

position

assumed the position.”
Pollock considered the motion

”out of order” since Sophie Mas- '
_loff legally retains the powers of

president of City Council.
Other members, such as Coun-
cilman lim Ferlo, said that it
would be a violation of the city
charter for Masloff to act as both
mayor and Council president.
”As far as the city law depart-

ment is concerned, there is not

violation of city law,” said City
Solicitor Dan Pellegrini. ”There
was much controversy, but this is
the way it has been worked in the
past.”

Alleged rape victim arrested for prostitution

(AP) A woman who claimed
two Butler County men raped her
and videotaped their acts has
been arrested on prostitution
charges, authorities said Tuesday.

The 36-year-old McKeesport
woman, who was not further
identified, was arraigned on
prostitution charges Tuesday and
was held on $5,000 bond,
authorities said.

Pittsburgh policeman Sgt. Louis
Garda said the woman was arrest-
ed Monday night after she ap-
proached the unmarked police

3 car of detective James Toler and

asked if she could get inside. Gar-
da said the woman agreed to per-
form a lewd sexual act for $40
and was arrested.

Garda said the woman was free
on bond following a May 10 ar-
rest on prostitution charges for

_ soliciting the same detective.

Meanwhile, Gregory S. McMa-
nus, 27, of Mars, and George
Fichter, 34, of Zelienople, re-
mained in the Butler County Jail
on charges of kidnapping, inde-
cent assault, unlawful restraint
and firearms violations in con-
nection with the alleged incident

Friday.

The woman told police the
men picked her up early Friday
outside a downtown nightclub af-
ter she missed her bus, authori-
ties said. She said 'the men
handcuffed her at gunpoint and
took her to McManus’ home,
where she was raped and held
captive for about 18 hours before
she escaped, authorities said.

Cranberry Township detective
Frank Evanson said the men
produced a videotape of the al-
leged attack which showed them
having sex with the woman and
threatening to do her harm unless
she went along with them.

Evanson said the men and the
woman are ’’clearly identifiable”
on the videotape.

She said Cranberry Township
police will ask the Butler County
district attorney how to proceed
with the investigation in light of
the woman's arrest Monday
night.

McManus’ attorney, Anthony
T. Floro, said his client's ”posi—
tion is that the complainant is a
prostitute and was paid $200 in
cash for her services.”

Research shows racism
affects black enrollment

STATE COLLEGE, PA —
Research suggests racism and not
a drop in black high school
graduates accounts for declining
black enrollment at colleges na-
tionally, a Penn State University
professor said Tuesday.

”The pool of available black
students is deeper than it was, but
[college] attendance is declin-
ing.” said Harold E. Cheatham,
an associate professor of edu-
cation.

U.S. Census figures show the
percentage of black high school
graduates attending college
dropped from 33.4 percent in
1975 to 28.6 percent last year,
Cheatham said.

As reasons for declining black
enrollment, colleges cite in-
creases in homicides, teen preg-
nancy, drug use and cuts in
financial aid, Cheatham said. But

he said the problems also have af-
fected whites.

Once at the schools, studies
have shown black students often

experience feelings of alienation,

isolation and powerlessness.

Ga y rights coalition
protests AIDS funding

HARRISBURG (AP) —~ A Coali-

the Capitol on Tuesday to protest
what they called ”the criminal
amount” of money Pennsylvania
spends on AIDS.

Representatives of gay and les-
bian rights and AIDS activist
groups from across the state
deposited three cents at Gov.
Robert P. Casey's office in protest
of the amount the state spends
per capita on AIDS education.

Rep. Babette Josephs, D-Phila-

nia continues to spend small
amounts now, it will pay later in
terms of human suffering and
misery. ~

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, May I8, 1988

By Gretchen Haller

For The Pitt News

The controversy over possible
insufficient attendance by
representatives of labor and local
elected officials at Pitt's recent
”Conference on Milltowns:
Despair, Hopes and Opportuni-
ties” indicates that ”the issue
must have some importance,”

' said Dr. James Cunningham,

Professor of Social Work.

Cunningham, who works on
the River Communities Project,
spoke to 108 conferees on the
recovery of Mon Valley commu-
nities.

The gathering of representa-
tives from business, education,
labor, religion and philanthropy
on May 5-6 at Nemacolin Confer-
ence Center was the third in a ser-
ies of discussions on strategic
regional issues hosted by Presi-
dent Wesley Posvar since 1983.
The conference studied the Mon
Valley as a problem area caught
in the steel industry's decline.

A May 12 article in the Pitts-
burgh Post Gazette quoted some
conference participants as saying
that representatives of labor and
local governments should have
been included.

While the university declined
to release a complete list of over
200 invitees, the list of those who
attended included two state legis-
lators from the Mon Valley,
representatives from Washington,
Westmoreland and Fayette
County Commissioners, United
Steel Workers, the Unemployed

Council of Southwestern Pa., the

Mon Valley Progress Council and
the Mon Valley Development
Team.

"Whatrthis points out,” said
Cunningham/’is the need for
these recommendations to be
taken to the local Mon Valley
communities so the electorate
can understand and debate
them.” .

Dr. Morton Coleman, also a
conference participant and
professor of social work, believes
that the role of the university now
is ”to find the means to put into
action and to monitor the confer-
ence recommendations."

According to Dr. Vijai Singh,
organizer of the conference, ”At—
tendance would be relevant only
if Pitt went in with a proposal,
such as, ’Should we build the
Mon Valley Expressway? Which
way should it go?’ But that's not
our purpose. Our job is to bring
people together and to be an in-
formation analyst.”

”The president will convene a
group like this, people who rare-
ly meet, and pose these ques-
tions: Where are you? What have
you done? We don't want to stop
with doing analysis, but we can't
get too involved/'he said.

Singh is also director of the
Center for Social and Urban
Research, whose second annual
State of the Region Report (six
counties) is set for release this
week.

. Pitt has assumed a leadership

role in the area's redevelopment,
he said, aside from its being part
of the joint regional partnership
for Strategy 21, which includes
the City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny
County and Carnegie Mellon
University, he cites Dr. Posvar’s
commitment to this issue.

”We’re a public institution. We
have an obligation,” Posvar said.

”We developed a concensus on
a number of initiatives which will
be recommended soon in a writ-
ten report.”

66

We're a public insti-
tution. We have an ob-
ligation.

— Dr. Wesley Posvar

Two of the major recommen-
dations which emerged from the
conference are: assisting commu-
nities to consolidate for efficien-
cy with ”housekeeping” services,
such as garbage collection and

sewage, as well as expensive

public services, such as police
and fire protection; and en-

couraging state legislation which
would allow tax abatements for
new industries in economic en-
terprise zones.

In addition, specific initiatives
to increase volunteer support,
such as expanding the Leadership
Pittsburgh Program which de-
velops young leaders, and to
push Strategy 21, the $2 billion
regional development plan to
coordinate public and private
funds for diversifying the Pitts-
burgh area economy, were for-
mulated.

As an example of the magni-
tude of the problem, Karen
Miller, Secretary of the Pa. Dept.
of Community Affairs, said that
while 300 distressed communi-
ties would qualify for funds and
technical assistance under Act
47, only 100 across the state
might receive it.

Nemacolin conference probes ’mil|town’ plights

As a means of preventing
municipalities from fighting over
which one might get a new in-
dustry, she also suggested form-

‘ ing special benefit districts for

sharing taxes, as is done in Min-
neapolis. When an industry set-
tles in one municipality, for
instance, that town would receive
60 percent of the taxes, while the
others would receive 40 percent.
This is a major issue for the de-
veloping communities near
Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport.

No concensus was reached by
conference participants on
whether or not there should be a
Mon Valley Expressway, which
some fear might isolate certain
communities, nor whether a rail
connection should run through
the Mon Valley to Pittsburgh,
Sewickley and the airport. Cau-

tious disagreement continues on
whether or not there is a leader-
ship vacuum in the area.

President Posvar will report
back to the conference attendees
on the recommendations, said
Singh, and also on what coali-
tions have been formed and
where certain initiatives will get
underway.

”Some already have," he not-
ed, ”such as Pitt working closely
with the Southwestern Pa.
Regional Planning Commission.

ble. We are in the process of ac-

model to analyze the weakness-
es and strengths of the regional
economy.

”On another level, we are be-
ginning to develop a data base for
the Mon Valley communities
[which should show] how much
growth they share,” he said.

Professors Cunningham and
Coleman expanded on the role of
the university.

”Centers such as UCSUR, the
School of Public Health, Gradu-
ate School of Public and Interna-
tional Affairs and the School of
Social Work have a wealth of
resources in faculty, students and
staff, and could give specific help

to communities and institutions,”
said Cunningham.

”The university could do
branch research in technology
and biotechnology in
McKeesport and Monessen
Hospitals, help people cut off
from health insurance and help
retain youth with youth enter-
prise programs,” he added.

Cunningham went on to say
that ”Pitt needs to encourage
faculty to give their expertise with
public service incentives toward
tenure, promotion and salaries.
The university has a self—interest
in the region. As the region goes,
so goes the university.”

Coleman believes that the

university should provide
research and technical assistance.

’’It should play a role in edu-
cation and technology,” he says.
”Then it should take the lead to
develop a regional structure and
be an advocate for the state. It
should expand Strategy 21 and
accelerate it as soon as possible.
This is harder than creating Strate-
gy 2l, which was sort of a wish
list. Now they have to make
choices.”

Both Cunningham and Cole-
man praised the regional analy-
sis made by plenary session
speaker Peter Szanton, a public
policy analyst from eastern Mas-
sachusetts.

Council—-

Continued from page 1

According to the city charter,
the council president is to serve
as mayor in the event of a vacan-
cy in that office. The acting
mayor then retains the position of
council president, but does not
have the power to vote on coun-
cil decisions.

Masloff said that she will abide
by the majority decisions of

council. Woods said that he was I

one of Sophie Masloff’s main sup-
porters.

According to yesterday's edi-
tion of The Pittsburgh Press, Pol-
lock refused to stand and
recognize Woods as ”Mr. Presi-
dent" as is standard council prac-
tice. Afterwards, Woods said that
Pollock’s behavior was
”childish.”

Pollock was unavailable for
comment.

Pollock currently holds the
second-ranking council position,
chairman of finance. Woods may
remove him from that position,
although Pollock has said he
doesn't believe Woods possess-
es that power.

Woods said, ”There will be
more than one change, but at this
time I don't know what they will
be.”

Woods said that he gets along
well with the majority of the
council members and that he has
held a leadership position during
six of his seven years on City
Council.

"The job is nothing new to me.
I had it once before for two
years," Woods said.

is that they have events all
throughout the year, not just one
or two events. Their athletes train
three nights a week all year for
many of the events. It's also in-
ternational, with athletes from 70
countries participating.

”lt’s local, national and interna-
tional,” she said. ”The Special
Olympics also has more leisure-
ly events, such as golf, bowling
and skiing for some of the older
athletes.”

Puntureri stated that Greek

Week will essentially consist of
the same activities as in the past,
except that ”G reek Gorge will be
eliminated, as it's been shown
that it can lead to eating disord-
ers. There will be a ‘make a meal’
relay instead.” In addition, she
stated that there will be more em-
phasis on the Dance Marathon
and less on canning for money.

”We’ll also incorporate volun-
teer hours for Greek Week
points, as they need volunteer
help as much as money,” said
Puntureri.

”We have not yet set a finan-

cial goal, but one will be released
at a reception in October. We
have to figure out a' feasible
goal,” said Ben Leff, business
manager for Greek Week.

’’It’s going to be fundraising
and fun raising,” said Bizick.
”Once you've met these people,
you'd be motivated to go out and
collect funds for them. It's good
publicity and profile for the frater-
nity image, and it’s a good
charity.”

The dates for Greek Week have
tentatively been set for late March
through early April of 1989.

Running mate debate

For all Jesse Jackson's demands for ”reciprocation” of his ef-
forts to register Democratic voters, it would appear that Mas-
sachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis will be competing with
Vice President George Bush for the leather chair in the White
House. With the nominees themselves virtually assured, the
question of running mates is the next in logical succession.

In the most recent polls, conducted by CBS-New York Times
and the Harris agency, Bush and Dukakis have nearly equal
voter support, with Dukakis showing a small lead teetering on
the edge of the margin of error. Clearly, the choice of running
mates will play a visible role in the coming campaigns.

Dukakis’ list of possibilities contains a wide range of benefits
and pitfalls. Were he to select Jesse Jackson, he would proba-
bly win some additional votes from the leftward wing of the
party, but possibly at the cost of a large number of moderate,

’ especially southern, voters.

Sam Nunn (D—Ga.), is practically at the other end of the spec-
trum. His position on the Senate Armed Forces committee and
his long tenure in Congress have given him foreign policy and
defense experience that would surely be a valuable asset to
Dukakis.

For Bush (Bosh, in some circles), the choice of a more liber-
al running mate would bring him closer to the center, which
he must do to win in November, although his reputation as
a Reagan supporter might suffer as a result. Elizabeth Dole, form-
er Secretary of Transportation, would seem the most reasona-
ble choice for Bush; her gender would attract liberals to the
ticket, and her position in the Reagan cabinet would eliminate
talk of straying from the path.

In both cases, though, it remains to be seen whether the
choices of running mates will be based on policy concerns or

on charges of wimpishness.

Fashion advice for the spring

Less is best. And there is
definitely something to be said
for ”clippies” to keep spiral
perms from wilting under the hot
summer sun. It doesn't take much
to maintain a stunning personal
appearance even while you
sweat.

Begin your day with a shower
and use perfumed soap; Ivory is
for wimps and Dial for the more
masculine types. Remember to
Caress before you dress. Follow
up with regular applications of
Ladies’ Choice powder fresh

-scent. Next, layer on regular baby

powder for a silky—smooth feeling
all day.

To keep yourself flowery-
smelling the day through, apply
dabs of perfume behind each ear
and other pulse points. Pretty
scents include: Jontue, Beautiful,
Giorgio and Emeraude. If you feel
daring, try a dribble of Obsession.

.Not too much, though; it drives

boys crazy and might even attract
a grown man.

During the summer months, a
tan is as much a wardrobe neces-
sity as biking shorts. Try Estee
Lauder’s sunless tanning creme
for a tan without the trouble. It’s
easier than tanning beds and
beats hours in the hot sun. Don’t
forget to make bikini lines girls,
for appearance’s sake. You cer-
tainly don’t want the boys to
think you've been sunning nude.

If you insist on tanning avec
soliel, take a tape player to the
park and play George Michael's
Faith album. It's a sure attention
getter.

For heaven's sake, if you ha-
ven't bought your ticket yet, do
so immediately. It's sure to be the
social event of the season. You
only have three months to find
the outfit for the occasion. We
suggest something daring but still
cutesy. C’mon girls, bare that
midriff. Look for a floral print,
something pink, yellow and
green, and pastel, of course. The
flowers should be at least three

inches in diameter. Try Brooks
stores, they always have some-
thing fashionable. Don’t mix
prints, though. Opt for a solid
color mini or biking shorts.

And remember, no outfit is
complete without matching eye,
lip and nail ensembles. A sure bet
is a Covergirl set and Lee’ Press-
On Nails in new fashion colors.

If you go to the concert with
friends, coordinate your outfits,
but don't wear identical clothing.
lndentical outfits are a fashion no-
no. Remember that the concert is
liable to be hot, so make sure you
take purse—sized baby powder,
perfume and hairspray. For the
best hold, buy Final Net; the bot-
tles are so darling. Keep up that
fashion identity. Suck those tum-
mies in and maybe we'll see you
backstage at the concert.
Ta—Ta.

Missi and Mitzi are the fashion
editors for our cute little
newspaper.

An examination of the Ten Commandments

God’s work seems to have lost
its spiritual funding. Robertson
was forced to admit this wasn't
really going to be the Year of Our
Lord. Jesse Jackson's sheep have
left the fold, migrating to Mas-
sachusetts. For all the promises of
heavenly approval, the preachers
are again left with a private rela-
tionship with their visions of the
godhead.

Where have all the faithful
gone?

What do the people want?
What will it ‘take to convince
them? A hurricane deflected by
the thin pages of the Holy Book
wasn't enough? With credentials
illustrated in Technicolor, the
men of God are still alone on
their mountain tops. The view
must be breathtaking, but the
new sermons from the mount
have failed to reach the- masses
huddled in the valleys. It seems
time to speak of Jesus.

In The Book of Revelation, a
story is told of the day when the
Lord Jesus will again walk the soil

of the earth. As we have been
reminded for two thousand years,
that day is coming. In that time,
we have certainly been doing our
part to attract divine providence.
We lace the ground with beacons
powered by nuclear waste. We
have built a portal for the
A|mighty’s aide—de-camp over the
South Pole, pushing the ozone
aside. We have warred, the
cacophony of artillery and death-
cries rising to the promised land.

But still, he has not come.
Perhaps we need to try a new ap-
proach. We have been guided by
the Ten Commandments for too
long, and they obviously have
done us little good. Jesus still sits
waiting.
_ We are instructed not to kill.
Which is to say, obviously, that
we shall not kill those who agree
with us. The Crusades were sanc-
tioned by God, no? So, in es-
sence, we must not kill unless it
will assist the spreading of the
Word.

God's name shall not be taken

in vain. Here, the Command-

 

MATTHEW
'l'I-IORNTON

ments‘ are a little fuzzy. God is
obviously willing to aid our sold-
iers in battle; calling on him to
take a hand in a little killing is no
problem. However, to ask for
god's help for the murder of good
Christians would be unthinkable.
Thankfully, the masses have al-
ways had the help of priests and
holy men to make such tricky
judgment calls.

We shall not steal. It is impor-

tant to remember that taking land
that has been inhabited for thou-
sands of years by a heathen peo-
ple, say for example, Buddhists,
is not stealing. It is merely moral
reclamation.

The coveting of goods is an ab-
horrent action. The Church,
though, needs large amounts of
money to properly honor the
Lord. What higher tribute is there
than to honor a man who died a
penniless criminal in a church
glittering with light from 30-foot
high windows? Upon this rock
shall be built his church, but the
rock must be quarried to provide
the foundation stones.

A graven image of the Lord is
a faux pas, to be sure. The cross
is one of the most brutal torture
devices ever created by the hu-
man imagination. It is the symbol
of eternal love. The Pope dress-
es in robes that would have
shamed Louis IV; a kiss to his ring
is in itself an act of worship. To
strictly define ”graven image”
would be to reduce the Basilica

I ~ . ' . - . . . . . i . . .

to basalt, crushed under the
weight of God's love.

We should honor our mothers
and fathers, even if it means kill-
ing another person’s parents in a
war to earn their respect. It is
duty, and duty should never be
confused with morality. The lat-
ter is but a product of the former.

The Sabbath is to be kept holy,
a commandment which is
difficult to refute. Even the soldi-
ers of the Lord need rest.

The institution of marriage is
sacred, and adultery is forbidden.
I have no problem on that count.
Maybe it's not a hindrance to the
work of the Church. The huddled
masses cast an affirming vote on
this one in the case of Gary Hart,
a man cast out for his baser in-
stincts.

. The Lord God shall be honored
with the heart and with the mind,
and there is forgiveness for the
transgressors. God is benign, like
the best tumors.

spective editor for The Pitt News.

THE PITT NEWS

Lane to join Smith,lGore
in next month's pro draft

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

The way things look right now, The Pitt
Panthers could have their first-ever dual
first—round picks in the National Basket-
ball Association draft this year.

Yet, if most Pitt basketball fans had their
say, they would be content to let this
piece of history occur sometime in the
distant future, much further down the
road than draft time in late June.

But that will be left up to one of the 23
NBA teams. Junior forward Jerome Lane
declared himself eligible for the NBA draft
last Thursday, when he filed a letter—of—
intent with NBA Commissioner David
Stern, forfeiting his final year of eligibili-
ty with the Pitt program in the process.

He joins graduated teammates Charles
Smith and Demetreus Gore on the draft
list.

Lane, 6-foot—6, and Smith, a 6-10
center, formed perhaps the best one—two
inside punch in the country. Both have
been projected as first—round draft picks
in the June 28th NBA draft, with Smith
in the first ten picks and Lane projected
as a ninth through 17th pick.

Lane decided it was time for him to pro-
vide some financial stability for his fami-
ly in Akron, Ohio.

Smith, Gore and Lane, Pitt's starting
front line for the past two years, account-
ed for nearly 60 percent of the Panthers’

offense last season. Smith and Gore’s~

departure, although hurting the Panthers’
game, was expected. Lane's was not, and
that hurts the team even more.

"l don't think you ever agree with any-
one leaving early,” said Pitt assistant
coach Mark Coleman. "All you can do is
wish him luck.''

And luck is something Lane may need
to make it in the pros.

Undoubtedly one of the premiere re-
bounders in the country, Lane’s game was
based around the basket. He never deve-
loped an outside shot to complement his
fine inside skills.

"lt'|l take him a couple of years to de-
velop a consistent jump shot. He won't
be able to tip the ball to himself two or
three times in the pros, like he did in col-
lege," Coleman said. "lt will take him a
few years to learn the outside game.”

There had been much speculation over
the past year about Lane’s supposed
departure. But most pro scouts said his

Pitt hoops

Wednesday, May l8,'l988 ,

size would not enable him to play at pow-
er forward, his position at Pitt. He would
have to play small forward or shooting
guard, both of which require a consistent
outside shot.

"If he gets drafted by the right team,
he'll do well,” Coleman said.

Lane has shown great interest in play-
ing for the Cleveland Cavaliers, so that his
family and friends could come to see him
play. ‘

Lane is the second Pitt player in the past
year to bring up the possibility of an ear-
ly NBA career. Smith also considered go-
ing pro prior to his senior season. But after
talking to pro scouts and coaches, he
decided to stay and try to raise his draft
stock, even though he probably would
still have been a high ‘pick.

Lane, on the other hand, feels this year's
draft will be much weaker than next
year's, and he'll be a higher pick because
of it. A

"He talked to a few people, a couple
of scouts and coaches," Coleman said.
"They told him where he would be draft-
ed, in the middle of the first round.

"lt was different with Charles [Smith].
He knew he would be a high draft pick,
and he wanted to come back and see
what he could do as a team player. Jer-
ome knew he would be a lower pick,"
Coleman added.’

But now that Lane — the nation's lead-
ing rebounder as a sophomore, and third
last year —- has officially departed, the im-
mediate question is what will happen to
the present Pitt team.

"We'll be very young,” said Coleman.
"We'll probably start four sophomores
and a junior, if Rod Brookin is academi-
cally eligible, and that's a very young
team.” ‘

Lane would have been the Panthers’
only returning senior.

Fortunately for Pitt, the four sopho-
mores —— Sean Miller, Bobby Martin,
Darelle Porter and Jason Matthews —- saw
extensive playing time last season. And
the addition of Proposition 48 casualty
Brian Shorter and junior college transfer
Gilbertjohnson will also bolster Pitt's in-
side game.

"We're lucky all the freshmen have ex-
perience,” Coleman said. "They're play-
ing like juniors with the experience they
have.

"We should be okay —— just a little
thin.”

won't be same without Lane

J VI Phomhe Pitt News
Junior Jerome Lane will forgo his final season at Pitt to enter the NBA.

  
  
  
 
 
   
  
 
   
 
  
 
 
   
      

The first time I met Jerome Lane
was at a pre—season practice ses-
sion at Trees Hall in October of
his freshman season. My first im-
pressions of the man Pitt fans
would come to know as 'Rome
were much the same then as they
are now.

Many basketball magazines
listed Lane as an off—guard or
small forward coming out of
St.Vincent-St. Mary High School
in Akron, Ohio. So I thought I
would encounter some skinny
guy who could jump out of the
building and stick it from 20 feet.

Hardly.

Lane was built like a tank. He
had arms that didn't stop, thick,
muscular thighs and an overall
physique resembling that of a
defensive end, and not Dr. J,

Lane’s hero.

And he was a man—child.

At the time, Lane was in a bat-
tle with senior Darryl Shepherd
for a starting spot at small for-
ward. Lane tried to be kind with
his words. He said he didn't want
to step on any toes and wouldn't
mind if Shepherd started ahead of
him.

Five minutes later, Lane did an
about-face and said he would be
shocked and extremely disap-
pointed if he wasn't starting mid-
way through the season.

That shouldn’t surprise those
who know 'Rome. He's a man of
many words. Sometimes too
many words.

His quotes are almost as fa-
mous in media circles as his slam
dunks.

JOHN
ENRIGI-l'I'

 
the

Evidence following
Jerome-ese:
0 After Lane had a superb first-

half rebounding display, only to

 

be followed by a poor showing
in the last 20 minutes, he offered
this excuse: "In the second half,
they were putting four and five
guys on me.”

0 "Rome wasn't built in day.
This 'Rome took two years."

0 ''I ain't into no arguing, but
a coach's thoughts got to be ver-
satile."

0 ’'I’m not taking anything
away from [Syracuse forward
Derek] Brower, but no big man
in the country can guard me on
top. Period."

0 "Yeah, when we play Geor-
getown down there in Ohio, we
just can't seem to beat 'em.”

While many of ‘Rome's com-
ments usually caused much
laughter, he also said some rather

. disdainful things about Pitt's op-

position. I'm sure a few of his
quotes ended up on some teams’
locker room chalkboards.

But Lane was in the media
spotlight, and he loved it. Most of
the time he didn't mind being in-
terviewed, because it gave him a
chance to displaythe cockiness
that pervades his personality. '

Last November, at the, Big
East's annual media luncheon in
Manhattan, Lane was asked if he

had learned a lesson about
offending others with his
comments.

"No. When I talk, I like to free-
lance. I just tells the truth,"
'Rome said.

Obviously, Lane didn't think
there was a lesson to be learned.

But while Lane's off-the-wall

Please see Jerome, ‘page 8

\~\\~

 

Continued from page 10
comments often got him into
trouble, his play on the court, es—
pecially his rebounding, kept the
compliments gushing out of an-
nouncers, scouts and opposing
coaches’ mouths. And they were
just telling the truth.

°_”... no one in the country,
and I don’t care how big he is,
can outrebound Jerome Lane,
one-on-one,” said Syracuse
coach Jim Boeheim.

0 ”... a glass eater who
dominates the boards like no
other one in the country,” said
ESPN’s Dick Vitale.

0 ”He’s awesome under the

boards. Jerome, he lives for the
rebounds. He doesn't care about
his shots. He rebounds,” added
Florida forward Livingston Chat-
man after watching ’Rome pull
down 21 boards against the
Gators.

0 ”Game in and game out, Jer-
ome is the most dominating play-
er in the Big East,” said Seton
Hall coach P.J. Carlesimo.

The accolades were well-
deserved for ’Rome. Teammate
Charles Smith often got the head-
lines, but ‘Rome was the Pan-
thers’ enforcer and their key to
success.

As ’Rome went, so went the

fortunes of the Pitt basketball
team. The Panthers won nary a
big game the last two years if
Lane didn't play well.

He has left an indelible mark
on Pitt and Big East basketball. I
wish he would have stayed in
school, but I'm not qualified to
say if that would have been in
Lane's best interest.

What I do know is that Lane
didn't come here to get an edu-
cation. He feels he is ready for his
life's work. More power to him.

Although Lane played three
seasons at Pitt, he crammed
almost all his success into the last
two seasons.

His greatest feat may have been
the backboard he smashed Jan.
25 at Fitzgerald Field House, or
the way he manhandled Syracuse
towers Derrick Coleman and
Rony Seikaly in each of Pitt's last
three victories against the
Orange, or his 21 rebounds and
20 points against Connecticut, or
his monster dunk over Geor-
getown’s Michael Jackson at the
Civic Arena his freshman year, or
a similar dunk earlier in the sea-
son against St. Francis, or the
dunk against Westminster in his
college debut when the force of
his rim—ratt|er toppled the
45—second clock that sits above
the basket, or the gorilla dunk
over a Marist player in the first
round of the NCAA tournament
two years ago, or the way he
matched the Georgetown Hoyas’

 

roughhouse tactics with a few
shots of his own, or the...

it's your choice. His career was
filled with many fine moments.
He was Pitt's third all-time lead-
ing rebounder and eighth a|l—time
leading scorer. He was the Big

East's greatest window cleaner

ever.

There's no doubt he was enig-
matic, controversial, recalcitrant,
loquacious and, at times, puerile.

But he was still largely a
success.

He was simply Je-Rome Lane,
that board-crashing brother, and
the most entertaining and unique
individual ever to don the Blue
and Gold of the University of
Pittsburgh basketball team.

(AP) — Tailback Brian Da-
vis, who tried to rejoin the
University of Pittsburgh's foot-
ball team after two years of
academic ineligibility, has
flunked out of school, accord-
ing to officials.

Mary Briscoe, dean of the
university's College of Arts
and Sciences, said Davis did
not pass the 12 credits need-
ed to stay in school.

Davis, who was readmitted
to the university as a full-time

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, May'l8, 1988

By Debbi Edwards

For The Pitt News

Most people went to work
Monday morning with news of
how they enjoyed the beautiful
weekend weather. Women's
track coach Steve Lewis had
other things to discuss. Lewis and
10 of his athletes attended the

tI'rEasterns at George Mason

University in Fairfax, Va. The sun-
ny weather was only a small con-
tribution to his happiness.

‘ 

All I can really say is
that the girls are a class
act.

——Steve Lewis

”Ten girls participated and 10
girls scored,” Lewis said. ”It was
a great team effort.’

Throughout the year, the relay
teams have been very successful.
The 400 meter relay team placed
first at the Big East one week ago
and finished fourth last weekend.
That team -— freshman Clarissa
Dudley, junior Debbie Bonner,
junior Pat Cupid and freshman
Keisha Demas — also broke the
school record on Sunday with a
46.54 time.

The 3200 meter relay team
repeated the act and claimed a
space of its own in the Pitt record
book. Junior Luanne Harris, fresh-
man Cathleen Chrissos, junior
Gloria Azeke and sophomore
Robin Hubauer placed third with
a time of 8:52.61.

The 1600 meter relay team was
Pitt's only first-place team. Dud-
ley, Ardy Hope, Cupid and De-
mas finished at 3:41.26.

Hope and Demas both placed
in the 400-meter dash. Hope ran
a personal best of 54.80 seconds
to finish sixth, while Demas, a
freshman standout, placed third
with a time of 53.50.

Demas is only two tenths of a
second away from qualifying for
nationals in her first year of col-
legiate competition. And she is
very honest with herself about the
tension that occurs at this level.

’’I’m scared. I let the competi-
tion intimidate me,” Demas ex-
plained. ”|t’s not until the last
100 when I realize there's a race
going on.” -

‘ It seems kind of scary to
wonder what she can do when
she gains a little more confi-
dence. Demas already owns six
indoor and three outdoor records
in the individual and relay events.
She also has been named All-East
and All-Conference.

”I found that I give more in a
relay event. If I could learn to
balance out my efforts, I could be
a great quarter—mi|er,” Demas
said.

Junior Hannah Russell compet-
ed in the heptathalon, earning
4,661 points to place her fourth
overall. Russell broke Pitt's
school record earlier this season
with a personal best of 5,170
points.

A twist in the placing occured
between Dudley and Bonner in
the 100-meter hurdle event. Dur-
ing the trials, Dudley finished at
14.66, while Bonner clocked a
14.44 time. In the finals on Sun-
day, Dudley ran a 14.11 to place
second, and Bonner was fourth at
14.18. Bonner holds three Big
East titles in the event and the
school record. However, she is
enthusiastic about the upcoming

— program and the promise of such

a talented freshman class.

”Clarissa and I are the same
type of hurd|ers,” Bonner ex-
plained. ”It can be any given day
when one of us runs a» better
time. I was very happy for my
teammate.”

But no one could have been
happier about the team's perfor-
mance than its coach. Placing
third as a team was an accom-
plishment for the Lady Panthers.

     
   
   
     
   
   
   
   
   
   

‘Lady Panthers give team effort at Easteirns

It has been nine years since they
placed in the top ten. A gifted
1979 team still highlights the
record books in the field and
sprint events. However, the
young team of today seems to be
placing those titles in jeopardy.

’’In comparison to times and
numbers going in, I knew our
highest possible finish would be

a third place," Lewis said.

The girls claimed third place
with 43 total points, placing them
higher than any other Big East
school. George Mason was first
and Penn State finished second.

”All I can really say is that the
girls are a class act,” Lewis said.
”And it's great to know theyiwill
all be returning.”

Strongside linebacker position

gives Christy new starting spot

By Mark Cohen

For The Pitt News

Last September, Freeport’s Jeff
Christy awoke one Saturday
morning with a difficult task be-
fore him. That afternoon, he was
to replace Pitt's standout middle
linebacker Jerry Olsavsky, who
had injured his knee earlier in the
week.

It was Christy's first collegiate
start. In fact, the freshman was in

his second game ever at Pitt.
Over 43,000 fans turned out to
watch the Panthers battle North
Carolina State.

Too much pressure for a young
freshman, right?

Perhaps, but Christy handled it
like an old pro. He made nine
tackles as Pitt registered its first
shutout in four years, 34-O.

Christy made three more starts
and had a season-high 1 1 tackles
in a 13-10 loss to Boston College.

But before the game ended,
Christy's season took one more
dramatic turn: Olsavsky returned
in the fourth quarter to reclaim
his position. Christy's career at
middle linebacker may have end-
ed that night.

’’I knew it was going to hapg
pen," Christy said, ”but I was
kind of upset.”

He didn't play any more last
season and the breaks did not ap-

pear to be going his way when
graduation rolled around ~- two
of Pitt's three starting linebackers
were off to the NFL. The third?
Olsavsky, of course.

To play would mean to move,
and Christy has done just that. He
put on five pounds (he's now 6-2,
230) and moved to strongside
linebacker. A look at Pitt's depth
chart shows Christy's name at the
‘ top.

"It took a while to get used to,”
Christy said after spring practice.
”There's a lot of different reads.
But I knew the defense from last
year, and that helps a lot.”

Christy was free to roam as
middle linebacker, where he
made 35 tackles in five games last
year. At strongside linebacker,
the job is more clearly defined.

There are more responsibili-
ties,” Christy said, ”but I've got
a longer time to learn the po-

r sition."

I
I

Christy, a business major, has
hopes of following his brother
Greg's career pattern: four years

at Pitt, then on to the NFL. Greg,
an offensive lineman, was forced
to retire from the Buffalo Bills
with a neck injury.

For now, the only thing Jeff
Christy sees when he looks up, at
least on the gridiron, are tight
ends.

”The main thing I have to wor-
ry about against the run are the
tight ends. I have to watch for
them hooking me. In pass cover-
age, |’m mainly responsible for
covering running backs.”

Christy runs a 4.7 40-yard dash,
but can he stay with speedy run-
ners like Penn State's Blair
Thomas?

"Maybe not [somebody] that
fast,” Christy says, ”but I'll try to
keep up with him in coverage. I'll
have to."

Speed is the key to the position,
according to Christy.

”Outside linebacker is easier to
learn,’' he said, ”once you learn
the defense. But you've got to be
quicker."

Thus far, Christy has not had a
problem in that area. In Pitt's

Blue—Gold game, which ended
spring practice April 30, he made
five tackles — including two for
losses totalling 13 yards - and
broke up a pass. In the game, he
also punted and played briefly at
fullback.

'’I'm the second team punter,”
Christy said with a laugh, "and

And?

”And it's going to stay that
way."

He said the coaches have not
told him anything about plans to
play fullback this fall.

Christy expects this season to
be even better than the 1987
campaign, which produced an
8-4 record. He'll settle for noth-
ing less than a New Year's Day
bowl game.

Pitt's defense lost a lot of ex-
perienced talent to graduation,
but there is no fear that the unit
will tail off.

”We have a long way to go,"
Christy admitted, ”but we'll be
ready by the time the season
comes around."

Lohman, Sherbondy receive Big’
East baseball honors at banquet

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

University of Pittsburgh base-
ball players Bill Sherbondy and
Brian Lohman were recently ho-
nored by the Big East Conference
for their achievements this past
season.

Sherbondy, from Mt. Pleasant
High School, was voted Big East
Freshman of the Year by the Big
East coaches.

Lohman, a senior from Mt. Le-
banon High School, was named
All-Big East as an outfielder. Loh-
man played both left and center
field as well as serving as desig-
nated hitter. Both of them
received their awards at the Big
East banquet held in Connecticut
last Monday.

In 16 conference games, Sher-
bondy hit .357. He had 15 hits in
42 appearances, scored 12 runs,
knocked in 10 runs and had six
extra-base hits. He finished with
a .619 slugging percentage and
was successful on three of four
stolen base attempts.

In the second game of a
doubleheader against Geor-
getown, Sherbondy smacked two
homeruns, including a three-run
shot in the top of the 10th inning,
giving the Panthers a 9-8 victory.
For the series, Sherbondy had 13
total bases in nine plate ap-
pearances.

Sherbondy was also strong in
non-conference games. He hit
.351 overall, third best on the
team. He was second on the team
in homeruns with three, had 14
RBI, scored 17 runs, hit four dou-

bles and was four for six in sto-
len bases.

Lohman, the Panthers’ MVP,
won the Big East batting title
while hitting .463 in conference
games.

Lohman had 25 hits in 54 at-
bats, including eight extra-base
hits. He had 14 RBI, three stolen
bases in four attempts and struck
out only five times. He played
error-free ball with a 1.000 defen-
sive average.

Overall, Lohman hit .400 to
lead the Panthers and was tied for
the team high with 40 hits and 18
RBI. Lohman closed out his
career with the Pitt record in hits
(158), at bats (445), homeruns
(20) and games played (121)_. He
finished with an impressive .355
career batting average.
