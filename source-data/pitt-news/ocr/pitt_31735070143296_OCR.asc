Port Authority provides buses for G—-20 police ‘

Carla Trinca-Conley
For The Pitt News

When the G—20 plarmers needed to
move hundreds of police officers
throughout the city during the G—20
Summit, they turned to the Port Au-
thority.

The Secret Service formed and di-
rectedacollaborative goup offederal,
state, countyand local agenciestocoor-
dinate transportation throughout the
G—2o, with the Port Authority serving

as one of its main contributors. _

The numerous police officers who
rode on the Port Authority buses were
from other states.

Jim Ritchie, a spokesman for the
Port Authority, declined to say how
many oﬁicers the Port Authority’s
buses transported, but he did say the
company was able to handle the load

with its normal number of bus driv- ,

ers.

' No agency paid the Port Authority
to do this, but the company did incur
expenses, Ritchie said.

He added that the Port Authority
is tallying up the expenses andwillre-
pottthemtothe event’s organizers. But
Ritchie refused to comment further.

He also declined to say where the
oflicers boarded the bus and where
Port Authority took them, citing “se-
curity issues.” . v

The company withholds certain
portions of its data and information
whether G-20 related or otherwise,
Ritchie said. '

. “Port Authority simply does not _

discuss certain aspects of security op-

 

 
  
  

 

erations in general   speciﬁc‘
details about securitycanputthe public
and our employees atriskwithfurther
events,” he said.

Daily riders questioned whether

bus routes would continue as normal

throughout the Summit. Ritchie said
the Authority made arrangements
to ensure public transportation rid-
ers would continue having service

' throughout the G—2o.

Ritchie said it’s not unusual for the
Port Authority to get involved in local
affairs. He said the companyprovided

 

transportation to out—of1town officers
who came to Pittsburgh inAprilfor the
memorial of Paul Sciullo H, Eric Kelly
and Stephen Mayhle—three city police
oﬂicers who were killed while respond‘-
ingto ‘a domestic disturbance call.

. In the past, the Port Authority has
transported peopleto prison aftermass
arrests, Ritchie said . ‘ ‘ .

_Also, when high schools in the vi-

‘ cinity of Pittsburgh are evacuated in

emergency situations, the PortAuthor-

. ityassists the schoolsinshelteringstw

dents on their buses,'Ritchie said. ‘

Pitt seniors unaffected, old cards acceptable until graduation

Card ( 1‘ _ ‘

students will pick up their new cards at their‘
designated department. Faculty and staff will
swap their cards with their department admin-
istrators.

Undergraduate students, excluding seniors,
have a different set of instructions to follow.
Students have a match day according to their
last name. On their designated day, students
will go to the Posvar Hall galleriabetween 9 am.
and 9 pm. with their old cards to receive a new

' one. The pick—up date for students corresponds

with the ﬁist letter of their last name. Students
who can’t make it during their assigned days are
allowed to go during a more convenient time

within the two-week duration. See the side chart

‘ for the list of pick—up dates.

Larson said Panther Central likes to “gve the
card a fresh look” every few years.

But the University also decided to redesigi
students’ ID cards this year because the Port
Authority is upgrading its technology.

When the bus company updates its vehicles,
students won’t ﬂash their cards at bus drivers.
Instead, they’ll ﬂash them at a reader, installed
on each of the buses, that recognizes the chip
inside the cards. The readerwill determine ,
whether the card is active or invalid.

‘The new identiﬁcation cards,” Larson said,

“will not change ridership.” ’

Anyone who is able to ride the Port Author-
ity busesnowwillbe able to afterthe card swap.

Larson said seniors will still be able to ﬂash ’
theircardsasthey usually do. L

“The old cards will still be accepted until [the
seniors’] graduation date. They didn’t want to
trouble seniors,” she said.

Larson said she thinks the new cards will
help the school and Port Authority keep better
track of students’ and professors’ ridership.
People who use counterfeit IDs or other people’s

old University IDs will no longer be able to ride , '

the buses without active cards.

cards now contain chips. -

“So, do not punch holes in it, mangle it or
rﬁutilate it in any way,” she said.

Mutilating the identiﬁcation cards will deac— _

tivate the technology. Panther Central will ﬁne
those who deliberately manipulate their cards a
$20 fee and will reissue that person a new one.

However, if cards are not working because
of the “normal wear and tear,” Larson said,
Panther Central will replace the card without a
fee as it has always done.

“The cards are sturdy and meant for use,”
Larson said; .

chicago misses bid, Obama’s trip still justified

It wasn’t even close for Chicago. Of
the 94 votes cast by the International
Olympic Committee inthe ﬁrst round,
Chicago received a slim 18 votes de-

. spite beingafavored candidate to host

the 2016 Olympics. Three other cities
were in the rtmningbesides Chicago:
Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Madrid.

For Chicago, and all of America for.

that matter, it was a stinging loss.

But President Barack Obama’s trip-

to Copenhagen stiH—wasn’t a wasted
endeavor. A ‘ ~

When Obama made the 11th-hour
trip to Copenhagen to advocate for
Chicago, some — particularly those
of the Right wing —— saw the trip as
a distraction from key issues, such

as the ongoing war in Afghanistan
and the perpetual health care debate.
Michael Steele, Republican National
Committee Chairman, expressed his
disagreement with Obama’s action,
according to CNN.
_“Ithinkatatime ofwar, Ithink at
a time of recession, at a time where
Americans have expressed rather sig-

' niﬁcantly their concerns and frustra-

, tions overthe course of the spring
and summer  this trip, while nice,

is not necessary for the president,” he

said. Unfo rtimately, neither Obama’s
address nor Michelle Obama’s sen-
timental speech to members of the
voting committee swayed the IOC
toward choosing Chicago. It might

have been a somber flight home for
the Obamas, but their efforts dem-

onstrated a level of commitment to '

an issue that is no less relevant than

other nationalconcerns. '
Obama was the ﬁrst American

president to attend an IOC vote

. among other government leaders,

heads of state and royalty. His visit
was intended to be quick and to the
point. Sure, the short time he spent
pushing for Chicago could’ve been
spent focusing on big issues, but the
Olympics carry international prestige.

‘ They’re an endeavor worth ﬁghting

for.
The Olympics place a significant
construction and organizational bur-

den on the host city. Yet, the city gar- _
ners the world’s attention and, even
though construction costs run high,
there’s more money generated from
the games in tourism.

Chicago is Obama’s adopted home-
town, and that fact assuredly carried
clout in Obama’s vigorous support.

While this is a particularly sore loss to '

Chicagoans, it affects all Americans.
But bashing Obama overwhat seems
an abysmal failure wouldn’t be an ap-
propriate response. The vote wasn’t
close and Chicago likelywou1d’ve still
lost with orwithout the president and '
Michelle Obama’s presence in Copen-
hagen. Obama’s effort exempliﬁes his
concern overthis issue, and, if nothing

else, he tried his best.

Of the other cities in contention ——-
Madrid and Tokyo —— Rio dejaneiro
seems the city that can beneﬁt the

- most in terms of its image. Rio will
be the ﬁrst South American city to

host the Olympics. It’s a sign of prog-
ress not only for Brazil, but for all of
South America. With an estimated
2008 GDP of $1.993 trillion, Bt-azil’s
economy is among the fastest grow-
ing in the world. It not only has the
money to put on a good show — the
Rio Olympic organizing committee
plans to spend $14 billion on theaffair
— but the 2016 games will continue
to advance the development of South:
America.

Lewis Lehe
Columnist

In August, I went on a month—long
tour of Colombia. Whenever I tell
people about my trip, they ask if
I went there to do cocaine. The

’ answer is no. I went to Colom-

bia so that I could bring it up in
conversation later and seem awe-
some. Today I would like to have
one of those conversations with
you. We will be talking about why
doing cocaine is uncool.

In the center of Medellin, Co-

Letter to the

To the Editor,

Have we not exhausted the G-20
from every aspect and angle already?
We are more than a week removed
from the actual Summit and the en-
suing riots. There is no need for an
apology from any member of any
police force that did his job on those

evenings.

There is, however, a need for an ‘

apology ﬁ“om the faceless 
who fueled violence on our campus.
Adrienne Mellori, from the worn-
out G-20 Resistance Project, had the
audacity to say in Friday’s article, “A

Musical duo focuses

V Colleen Counihan
Staff Writer

Kaiser Cartel

Howler’s Coyote Café with Eric Wil-
son & Cameron McGill

Oct. 5 ‘

Since its musical beginning ﬁve
years ago, the band Kaiser Cartel
said it wanted its listeners to feel like
they are in the band’s living room.

Even on tour, promoting its

newest EP Rack Ir/and, Kaiser Cartel ~

sticks with its personalized style of
mellow indie music. j <

“We want an intimate settin
with the audience, like we’re hang-
ing out with them and they’re hang-
ing out with us,” Benjamin Cartel
yelled from the driver’s seat, while
Courtney Kaiser held the phone for
an interview on the road.

“We used to say it’s like being in
our living room —— and that’s still the
vibe we’re going for,” Cartel said.

Though the name Kaiser Cartel
screams duo, that wasn’t the group’s
original intent.

“In the beginning,” Kaiser said.
“We were just playing music together
on tour. We didn’t have a band or

anything, and the name of our band i

came out of the audience’s enthusi-
asm. By the end [of the tour], they
were saying, ‘Where’s the Kaiser Car-
tel CD?’ We’ve never crafted what we
do to be a duo.” ‘ .

4 Kaiser and Cartel said the two-
some label never crossed their minds
in the formation of their band, but
they acknowledged their reliance
on each other.

Kaiser said it was Cartel’s talent
for drumming that initially drew her
to him,_but his songwriting offered

something different from her own, ~

and that made him an invaluable
partner. .

Similarly, Cartel said his female
counterpart added a sound that had
been missing. .

“I had been doing stuff by myself,
but when we played together, some-
thing happened that never happened
by myself. And once we played it live,

. the audience’s reaction proved it was

a good thing,” he said.

The new sound the musicians
found with each other was so im-
portant that they named their ﬁrst
full-length album Marc/a Fort/7, after
the ﬁrst day they played music to-
gether — March 4. '

Kaiser said the title also signiﬁed
the band’s new beginning.

Kaiser Cartel has changed its style

over the years, building up its instru-

. mentation and adding more technol-

ogy to create a larger sound.

‘ Kaiser said the duo used to play
more “organic” music-that was ig-
norant of technology but has since

 

As we grow, we apply
new challenges and a
new limit.

Courtney Kaiser '

changed its repertoire.

“As we grow, we apply new chal-
lenges and a new limit,” Kaiser said.
“We do it with two people, and there’s
this goal of ours to make something
sound huge with seemingly noth-
ing — and it’s a challenge. It actu-
ally surprised us how well it worked
sometimes.”

The band has also employed
techniques for songwriting that

"contrast with its early days of play-

ing together.

According to Cartel, the group
started by just playing each other’s
songs, but they now share in the

 

process.
“Now we’re vibing together,” he
said.‘ “I’ll have, like, a whole song
that’s almost ﬁnished, and she’ll add
apiece, and visa versa.” ’
Kaiser said the perfect example of

— this was the conception of the song

“Falling,” which emerged from one
of Cartel’s ideas.
“It can’t be narrowed down into

speciﬁc duties. We’re really ﬂexible

with the way we write,” Cartel said.

On their albums and throughout
their live sets, the duties are simi-
larly gray.

They share vocals, but Kaiser fo-
cuses on guitar and keyboard, while
Cartel mixes drums with intermit-
tent guitar.

Meanwhile, a xylophone and
other synthetic sounds amplify the
experience.

Rock I:/and, which is only avail-
able at their live shows and through
their website, consists of three new
songs and a cover of Lucinda Wil-
liams’ “Something about What Hap-
pens When We Talk.”

Kaiser Cartel’s ability to adapt
has made the band one that not
only surprises its audience, but of-
fers mellow music that invites its
listeners to intimately experience
the songs.

The musical duo will play at
Howler’s Coyote Cafe tonight.

More importantly, Kaiser Cartel
appears never to stop traveling and
making music.

With a seemingly never-ending

tour schedule and an additional sete s

of new songs, the band doesn’t show
any signs of slowing down yet.

Tybout: G-20 riotsnot so different from Romero’s fictional zombie attacks

Andy Tybout
Columnist

More than aweek ago, the streets of
Oakland became almost unrecogniz-
able. Tear gas ﬁlled the air. Students
ran for safer ground. The distant

’ sound of rubber bullets réverberated

across campus.
But if you’re a fan of George

._ Romero, you’ve probably seen all of
. this before.

Pittsburgh continually gets de-
stroyed — not just during political
summits and Super Bowl celebra-
tions,.but also in movies. _

There is one huge difference in
movies, though. The aggressors
aren’t hungry for chaos '— they’re
hungry for human ﬂesh.

Romero, a CMU graduate and

Pittsburgh native who now lives in .

Toronto, is the iconic director of most
of the “Living Dead” series, cult zom-
bie movies that usually take place in
or near our Steel City. He’s the man
responsible for Pittsburgh’s —— and

arguably, all of ﬁlm’s — undead .

Romero ﬁrst set out to destroy
our corner of Pennsylvania in 1968

with “Night of the Living Dead.”'

The movie, available on Hulu.com
for your viewing pleasure, goes like
this: Awoman visits her father’s grave
near Pittsburgh, and upon a nasty

The movie revolutionized the hor-
ror genre and gave Pittsburghers a
new monster to fear and celebrate.

That was more than 40 years
ago. .
Since then, zombies, like a grow-
ingbusiness, have diversiﬁed. They’ve

mer humans (“28 Days Later”) and

comedic, bumbling distractions
(“Shaun of the Dead”).

They’re usually not in Pittsburgh,
either. 2oo4’s “Dawn of the Dead,” for
instance, took placeinsome unlucky
Midwestern mall, and the upcom-
ing “Zombieland” looks to be a de-
lightfully dark romp through sunny

California.

Ewen Romero himselfhas moved
on. His latest ﬁlm, 20o9’s “Survival
of the'Dead,” takes place on an island

off the coast of North America — a _

decidedly un—Pittsburgh locale.

But Pittsburgh traditions die hard,
if they die at all.

We still consider ourselves a
working—class city. We still use in-
clines, and we’re still obsessed with
zombies. "

Maybe that’s why our city riots ev-
ery four months. Maybe that’s why, at
the slightest provocation, the streets
ﬁll with hoards of students and then
police and then tear gas. a

These roads were meant to be
overrun, trampled, destroyed.

Think about it. Does a Romero
movie really look that different from
what happened in Oakland during
the G-20 riots?

There’s the same mayhem, the
same destruction. And that’s not an

accident. One of the most endearing -

things about Romero’s creations is
that they’re still, in a sense, people.

Except in Romero’s case, it’s peo-
ple driven only by id, rage and the
mob mentality. Pittsburgh thrives on
that, and Romero, Ithink, knows it.

Pittsburgh isn’t a city that’s risen
out of the ashes of the 1970s.

on music, not merchandise

It’s a city that burns down and”?

rises with each seasonal riot, shed-
ding its old skin for a new, more cau-
tious one. _

When you think of this, you can’t

. help but think of the man who envi-
sioned it — the gray-haired, intellec— V.

tual director who turned Pittsburgh
into a post-apocalyptic wasteland be-
fore we, or the anarchists or whoever
the hell it was, ever did.

So here’s to you, Mr. Romero. You
don’t always make classics —— we’ll

let the documentary “OJ. Simpson:'‘'-*

Juice on the Loose” rest in peace.
But you are, perhaps unknowingly,
the man who speaks most directly
to the underlying psychology of the
Steel City. .

Funny trip to ‘Hell’

Ihe road to ‘Hell’ is paved with laughter, thanks to Tucker Max

Tucker Max (Matt Ciuchry) insults his latest batch of victims.

Kieran Layton
A8'E Editor

“I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell”
Starring: Matt Czuchry, Jesse Bradford‘
Director: Bob Gosse I ‘
Studio: Darko Entertainment

Grade: A-

His comments are outrageously offensive,
his lack of any remnant of morality shocking

and his stories too ridiculous to be anything -

but true.

Yes, Tucker Max is an a"°"hole, but damn, he
is hilarious '—- and so is the latest movie based
on his immensely popular work of d*ck-lit “I
Hope They Serve Beer in Hell.”

If you’ve read the book or Max’s blog, or

even heard about it from a friend, you know’

what you’re getting into with the ﬁlm.

If you haven’t, though, ask yourself these
questions: Am I easily offended? Do I often
laugh at the expense of others? How do .1 feel
about long exposition of a story involving in-

tercourse with a handicapped person?

If you have even the smallest amount of
morals, it’s likely that you’ll be offended at
one point or another during the ﬁlm,’but the
beauty of it is that the offensive remarks are

"pulled off with such wit and brevity, you can’t

knock Max for doing what he does best.
The ﬁlm’s plot is ﬂimsy at best and practi-
cally nonexistentat worst — but it’s irrelevant.

I Think “The Hangover” in Texas —— sort of.

The audience’s capacity to enjoy the ﬁlm
lies not within its technical merits, but rather
solely in the w_ell—written script.

' What should be “American Pie”—style hu-
mor is elevated to a level of wit appropriate
to the articulate and intelligent characters
involved e— Max and his friends are in law
school. .

Watch the ﬁlm with the knowledge that Max
is awidely despised, but equally hailed, person,
and don’t expect anything Oscar-worthy.

Be prepared, however, to leave the theater
with your side hurtingfrom too much laughter
and the knowledge that if you are destined for
hell, at least you’ll have amusing company —
and maybe a beer, too.

Early Pitt deficit ends in another shutout

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team gave up -

two goals  the ﬁrst 15 minutes
ofa3—0 loss to Providence atFounders
Field Saturday.

Coach Joe Luxbacher called the
early scores against the Panthers
(1-9-0, 0-5-0) inexcusable. Despite
the improved level of play "after the
opening minutes, Pitt couldn’t mount
a comeback against the Friars (5—3—1,
2-2-1).

“Our guys have to listen to what
we’re trying to do, and we have to get
consistent,” Luxbacher said. “They
needto notlook atthe bigpicture, but

worryaboutwhatthey’re responsible _

for and do that well.” .
‘Luxbacher said consistency has
eluded the Panthers all season, not
onlyas ateam, butalso wheniitcor"nes
to individual players. _
“It’s hard to get into a lineup be-
cause you don’t see the sameguystwo
gamesinarow,”Luxbachersaid. “One
game they play_ well, the next game

5 they don’ ”

Despite the troubles, Luxbacher

half.

 

We created some good
chances ... but we shot 5
them over and we shot
themwide.

Joe Luxbacher .

However, the Panthers are still
having diﬂiculty capitalizing on the
opportunities they generate.

“We created some good chances in
front of their goal, but we shot them
over and we shot them wide,” Lux-
bacher said. “We didn’t even require

‘their goalkeeper to make a save.”

Providence’s goalie had to make
onlythree saves the entire game.

The stat sheet and the actual game .

on the ﬁeld told two different stories,
Luxbacher said. Pitt out—shot Provi-
dence 13-11 and out—corner kicked
them 4-3. On the ﬁeld, however, the
Friars played defensively for most of
the game because of their early lead.
“You cannotmakemistakesatthis
level like we did,” Luxbacher said.
Providence’s Andrew Sousa scored
the ﬁrst goal inthefourth minutefrom

' 10 yards out, and Daniel Fabian fol-

lowed with a header goal in the 13th
minute. Fabian scoredagaininthe 81“
minute off a rebound.

Justin Boehm and Alex Betancourt
led the Panthers with two shots and
one shot on goal each. '

The loss was the ﬁlth straight Big

thers and their ninth straight loss. In

those nine losses the team has been

In two Big East games this weekend,
the women’s soccer team played
three overtime periods resulting in
a win against DePaul' on Friday and a
double overtime tie with Notre Dame
on Sunday.

Pitt had abundant scoringchances
inthevictory over DePaul (7152, 2-3-0

the Panthers (6-2-4, 1-0-4 Big East)‘
to hold off Notre, Dame (8-3-1, 4-0-1
Big East) .’

Head coach Sue-Moy Chin said she

V saw the difference between the team’s

ﬁrstvictory in the Big East and the ties
in its three other conference games.

“We were able to create scoring
chances for ourselves and then ﬁnish
them with goals,” Chin said.

After the ﬁrst half of play, Pitt
faced a 1-0 deﬁcit, but junior Liz Car-
roll scored on apenalty kick to tie the
game in the 69th minute.

In overtime, freshmanAshley Cub?
secured the victory with her team-
leading seventh goal of the season,
assisted by junior Rebecca Fraser.

Pitt 0, Notre Dame 0, double over-
time

In a game dominated by scoring’?
chances for Notre Dame, eight saves
ﬁom senior goalkeeper Alison Finch
kept Pitt competitive through two
overtime periods.

Chin offered praise for Finch and
her seniorleadership, saying, “She had
a great game [and] the entire teamwas
proud of her.”

Notre Dame out-shot Pitt 25-7
throughout the game, but Chin said
she believes Pitt had its chances, as
well, especially after regulation play.

“Our midﬁeldwas excellent, and ﬁt‘ ‘
the ﬁrst overtime, we had some great
opportunities,” Chin said. “We had
three comer kicks and one shot was
deﬂected out of the goal.”

offensive power on Oct. 9, as they host
