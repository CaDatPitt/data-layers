  Salary increase

  

proposal OI{’d

By Jack Finn
Asst. News Editor

Next year’s salary raises may be spelled out
more clearly for Pitt faculty and staff due to the
policy proposed by the chancellor’s Ad Hoc
Committee on Compensation.

Pitt’s Faculty Assembly unanimously approved

' a plan that would create strict guidelines for
determining salary raises for all staff and faculty if

the recommendations pass the Senate Council '

and are approved by Pitt Chancellor _I. Dennis
O'Connor. _ * - '

“This new policy will take some time to imple-
ment. [Complete implementation of the policy] is
unlikely to happen in the first year or even in two
or three yearsj’ ad hoc committee Chair. Philip
Wion said. _ _ .

The policy breaks the allocation of pay increas-
es into four parts: maintenance of real salaries,
merit, equity and market.

Maintenance of real salaries addresses the need
for salaries to be adjusted for inﬂation. The new
process will tie raises to the previous year’s
Consumer Price Index‘.

"If inflation increases 4 percent this year, then
all staff and faculty would receive a 4 percent
increase to insure that they are not losing real
income,’-”Wion said. '  ' '

The merit component of the policy would allo-
cate funds to each work unit to insure that each
faculty and staff member, whose performance is
judged meritorious, receives a merit increase. The
amount of the merit increase allocated to each

unit will be a set percentage times the salaries of ~

all faculty and staff in that unit.

An equity fund will be established to respond
to inequities in salary, such as unjustified gender
based differentials which are identified by sys-
tematic analysis. These funds are to be allocated
by O’Connor. I
V Funds from the market component of the total
pool are allocated to specific units by the chan-
cellor on the basis of documented need.
Consideration might be given, for example, to
school and department rankings in national salary
profiles and to’ shifts in relative rankings of staff
salaries in income profiles for various profession-
al and technical personnel, both in Pittsburgh and
in higher education generally. , "

“It is important for this university to remain
competitive with other universities, and industry
in general, in keeping the best people,” Wion
said.

The policy, as formulated, will apply to contract
salaries of all full-time faculty and part-time
tenure stream faculty, including faculty librarians,
except those in the School of Medicine, and to all
regular full-time and part-time staff not covered

College students take time out to tutor

By Steve Kozarovich
Staff Writer

Aiming to “get students excited
about learning,” Project Tutor is

designed to provide Pitt students as

tutors to children which will benefit
both college and elementary students,
according to Director Shirley Biggs.

“It gives us a chance to continue the

positive relationships with this univer-
sity and the community,” Biggs said.
“We want to get students excited
about learning.”

The program, which held its first
meeting last night in the union, is a
collaboration. between the Pitt and the
Hazelwood community.

Pitt Project Tutor started out with a
small but dedicated group of students,

tutor coordinator Laura Horn said. i

“It started out last spring as a pilot
program. Thirty-seven tutors were
involved and it was pretty darn suc-
cessful,” Horn said. ,

Hom said that the students involved
are all volunteers and that they
receive nothing but recognition, a free
T-shirt and a certificate.

Despite “anproa’acz‘iz/e”spm'ng, SGB plans for active semester

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

After what some Student
Government Board members
call an "unproductive” term, the
majority of the board says it is
currently planning projects for
the fall.

Walking for Panther Pride,
investigating union cubicle
space and placing a clock on
the William Pitt Union lawn are

just some of Pitt’s Student
Government Board’s objectives
this term.

Referring to the first term of
office, board member Brian
Bolton said he is upset about
the lack of productivity SGB
showed.

“I feel we should do more as
a board together,” Bolton said.
“I’m still having ill feelings
about the retreat  I don’t think
that bonded anybody. A lot of

things we wanted to do as a
board we still haven’t done, but
the year is just beginning. We
have a lot planned.”

SGB President Jacob Brody
said the board did get off to a
slow start last winter because of
the controversy surrounding the
SGB leadership retreat at
Nemacolin Woodlands which
cost an estimated $9,000. “If
board members have com-
plaints about the lack of pro-

ductivity of the board, then they
are complaining about them-
selves. The board is the board,”
Brody said.

But Brody also said things
would be changing this fall.

“I told the office staff I don’t
want the fall to be lame duck as
it has always been in the past,”
he said.

V To avoid this, Brody said he
has given the board members
specific assignments to work on

throughout the fall.

However, board member Joe
Foner said that he is tired of lis-
tening to what he can and can-
not do.

“I’m going to try to be more
productive  I’m going to do
my ownthing,” Foner said. “If
[the project] is feasible, I’ll do
it."

He said that some members
work better with direction,

Volunteers with groups

By Lisa Raff
The Pitt News

Have you ever seen an adver-
tisement for “Volunteers
Needed” and thought, “One day
I’ll do something like that” or
“I’d like to-help people, I just
don’t have the time 

Stop making excuses.

Dr. Terry Milani, associate
director of Student Activities
and Interim Greek Adviser, is
making it easier for students to
volunteer and for organizations
to get the volunteer help they
need.

This summer the Office of
Student Activities sent out regis-
tration forms for the Volunteer
Action Centerto all full—time
graduate and undergraduate
students at Pitt.

It received.S()0 replies and is,
at this moment, sifting through
them to form an organized sys-
tem by which agencies and stu-
dents can find the information
and services they need. '

The first goal of the VAC,
according to Milani, is to “find
where the student interests lie
and then parallel those interests
with the needs of agencies in
the area.” »

Essentially, “the VAC is a
clearinghouse for Pitt students
who want to provide communi-
ty service in the community.
The service will try to match
student interests with the needs
of community organizations”

and let relationships and com-

mitments build from there.

The program began this sum-
mer, and Milani hopes to have
the students who replied to the
mailing set up in a volunteer
position by the end of this
month.

As with any new system,
though, VAC has a minor glitch
or two that needs a little ironing
out. First off, “transportation is a
big factor, because not all Pitt
students have cars or other
readily available transportation
to get them to some of the
agencies, and then they’d have
to rely on public transportation.
But that’s a case—by—case prob-
lem.”

“We’re also working on class
schedules, trying to work
though their diversityvwith the
hours that are available for vol-
unteering at «agencies. But
again, that’s a case-by-case situ-
ation,” Milani said.

The VAC doesn’t work only
on an individual basis, though.
Milani plans on registering all
250 student groups on campus
to get them involved with the
volunteer opportunities around
the city of Pittsburgh.

The first year of VAC will be
devoted, says Milani, to devel-
oping a database of information
based on feedback from stu-
dents and agencies and to form-
ing solid relationships with
agencies such as the United
\Y/ay, local hospitals, Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic,

Laid back club scales, bi/ees, treles through PA

By Bradylslater
For The Pitt News

If new recruits took anything
away from last night’s informa-
tional meeting, it’s that the Pitt
Outdoor Club is definitely laid
back.

“There are no obligations in
our club, no cities, no mandato-

ry attendance,” said Secretary

Paula Burgner. “We’re very laid
back.”

The Outdoor Club’s lenience

allows its members to be a part
of limitless activities, Burgner
said.

Biking, hiking, rafting, camp— ,

ing, climbing and horseback
riding are all part of this years
agenda, but if members have
additional ideas, trips can be

organized. _

“If a club member wants to do
something, he or she [needs to
get] as many other members to
go along with them,” Outdoors
Club President Russ Wilson
said.

The club members usually.

schedule their outings for
Sundays, but there are four big-
ger trips that the club offers its

members, Wilson said. There is
a Christmas break trip, Spring
break trip and two climbing
trips to Seneca, W.Va.

Last year's Spring Trip includ-
ed camping and climbing for
the week.

But Wilson stressed additional
activities are always possible.

Coalition
revolves
around
earthly
agenda

By Robin Senor
For The Pitt News

Tackling issues such as
pollution from automo-
biles, the WTI incinerator
in East Liverpool, Ohio,

and Pitt’s involvement

with the controversial
Arizonaitelescope on Mt.
Graham, the Student
Environmental Action
Coalition is gearing up for
another year of activism.

“SEAC is what we want
to make it. It’s not a ‘save
the rain forest’ organiza-
tion. It’s not geared
toward anything in partic-
ular. It is what we want it
to be,  member Josh
Knauer said.

The members met to
start plans for an agenda
for the future, discuss past
accomplishments and to
inform new members
about what SEAC does.

SEAC is a national orga-
nization comprised of
40,000 members. It is affil-
iated with 3,000 schools
nationwide. Despite its
size, SEAC is a "grass
roots” organization — it
gains strength from small
local groups in different
areas,
Knauer. The group focus-
es on local issues as well
as national and global
ones.

“A huge component of
SEAC is our sense of com-
munity. We have a com-
mon bond here. We’re all
here for one reason,”
Knauer said. ,

Knauer stressed that
SEAC is responsive to and
dependent upon its mem-
bers.

SEAC sought to raise
awareness of fuel con-
sumption and pollution in
a “Ticket America” cam-
paign last year.

Members placed tickets
on cars that showed sta-
tistics such as fuel con-
sumption, problems it
causes and things con-
sumers could do.

Last year SEAC partici-
pated in protests in front

of WII, the incinerator in ‘

East Liverpool, Ohio,
whose operation is
opposed by groups who
say it is detrimental to the
Earth's environment.
Although no members
from the Pittsburgh area
were arrested, members
of SEAC from other areas
were. ' V

According to Biggs, the pro-
gram was intentionally kept
small in the beginning for
experimental purposes but the
focus is on growth this semes-
ter.

“We want to serve more chil-
dren,” Biggs said. “We told each
school to identify 50 students
who would benefit the most
from the tutoring.”

According to‘Biggs, the pro-
gram enables Pitt students to
help elementary and junior high
school students from St.
Stephens Elementary School,
Bergwin Elementary School and
Gladstone Middle School.

The students will meet twice a
week for roughly an hour.
Transportation is provided from
the Pitt campus to the schools
and back again to Pitt for each
tutuoring session.

Interest was shown over the
summer by about 160 students
but the program has only
received 49 firm commitments
so far, according to Horn.

Support has come from all
involved with the program,
according to Biggs. “We've had
wonderful feedback from the
parents,” Biggs said. “They have
been asking us all summer
about the progress of the pro-
gram. ,

“All three of the schools have
new principals and each of
them seems very, very excited.
We've been meeting all summer
in order to make the program
work,” Biggs said.

According to Biggs, each of
the project’s collaborators

deserves a lot of credit. They _

include the Pitt Office of
Research, Office of Urban and
Community Services, the School

of Education and the Office of ,

Student Activities.

recruitment,” said Biggs.
“Another great recruiter for us is
Lane Hornfeld, the president of
the Golden Key Club. As one of
the original tutors, she has used
her experience to convince oth-
ers to join the program.”

Non-university participants
that are involved include
Hazelwood’s Project Impact, the
Carnegie Library, the YMCA and
City Councilperson Bob
O’Connor.

“Bob O'Connor has been very
helpful,” Biggs said. “He has

really been pushing us. He,

wants to see the ‘program in

every school in the city.”
Students involved include

mostly education majors, but

the program is not exclusive to

them.

“Education is my major,”
junior Carlos Callwood said.
“I’ve tutored adults before but

I’ve never worked with kids. I .

think this will be a good experi-
ence for me.”
“'I’m really interested in the

kids,” junior Pam Wen said’. “I
want to let them know that they
can learn something.”
According to Biggs, there are
only three requirements for
those interested and that-the
program is still looking for peo-

ple.
“The tutors have to be avail-
able on Tuesdays and

Thursdays from 2 to 4 pm... or
on Mondays and Wednesdays

from 3 to 4:15 p.m.," Biggs said.
Other requirements are that the
tutors attend an initial day—long
training session and another
half-day training session and
that they prepare a brief tutorial
plan for each tutorial.

“This is the best program on
campus right now," Horn said.
“It will be one of the things that
people will remember after their
college careers.”

years. Mt. Graham is a proposed
telescope site that could possi-

Activists say that the moun-

some endangered species. Since

In the past, The Pitt News has endorsed presidential
candidates, mayoral candidates and Student
Government Board candidates. But there is a battle
waging right now, and the outcome of this particular
battle is even more important to the very existence of
the United States of America than the 1992 Presidential
Election. ' 9

Who will become the King of the Night?

Late night television that is. The contest will measure
the longevity, the charisma, the haircuts and the pure
comedy of both veterans and newcomers. Leno,
Arsenio, Limbaugh, Koppel, Letterman, Conan and
Chevy.

Who will lead America into the morning and into the
21st century? I

For us, this horse race was won before it officially
began last night with the premiere of the “Chevy Chase
Show.” Dave is our true late knight and deserves the full
support, not only of the Pitt community, but of the
American people. Experience and a qualified staff are
just a few of Sir David’s attributes. To put it simply - he
knows funny.

The rest of the late night contenders, although all fine
Americans we’re sure, are too much of a gamble. There

is too much at stake in_ the future of the late night air-

waves.
All Mr. Letterman is asking for is a mere five hours per

week from all of us. We all need to give if we want our

country to work. It’s time to fight apathy — watch televi-
sion. We owe, it to him, to ourselves and most irnpor-
tantly, to our country.

The Pitt News Top 10 Reasons David Letterman is King
of the Night: A

10. Dave was the 1978 Indy 500 Rookie of the Year.

9. “Late Show” provides 100% percent of the RDA of
riboflavin. '

8. Dave has yet to be convicted as a felon.

7. He won’t pay a lot for his mufﬂer.

6. "Periodic visits by Pea Boy.

5. Regis Unplugged.

4. He’ll paint any car, anytime for $99.95.

5. Buttafuoco, Buttafuoco, Buttafuoco!

2. Canadian bandleader promotes cultural diversity.

Pitt should keep off of Mt. Graham   i

Pitt students should consider whether we want

name linked with the University of Arizona’s tele-
scope project. In its 10-year history, the Mt.
Graham International Observatory Project and
the UA itself have been involved in one conspira-
cy after another, from environmental laws to
funding for this project.

Before construction was to begin, the UA was

to have contacted all the 'native—American nations

(tribes) in the area to find out if there were any
ties to the land. The UA contacted only one
nation, the Zuni, whose ties were in areas unnec-
essary for construction.The only problem was the
peak it chose is sacred to the San Carlos Apache
medicine men and is essential in

on two of the scopes, the UA reali'/.ed that the
equipment used to study the site was faulty.
Apparently, the atmospheric conditions on the
peak aren’t suitable after all. (This is how respon-
sibly the UA handles a multimillion dollar project,
and we might be giving it our money.) Nowthe
UA wants to build another road and move the site
to another pristine virgin peak on the mountain ...
the saga continues.

Just this spring, after over a year of fighting the
UA under the Freedom of Information Act, l)r.
Robin Silver was able to get access to the full
report on the MGIOP that was conducted for the
university before it decided to pursue the site.
Apparently, UA President Manuel Pacheco omit-
ted over 60 percent of the 1‘Cp()IT

before giving it to the UA Board

since 1969.  was the recommendation that

Then, the UA slipped a rider

the school ‘choose another site

into the Arizona-Idaho
Conservation Act during the last
minutes of Congress to become exempt from all
cultural and environmental laws. (This is a highly
unethical way big businesses keeps from being
accountable for the same laws that we all have to
adhere to by attaching clauses to a bill just before
it is voted on with no public hearings, sometimes
unknown to the legislators themselves.)

Using this deception was the only way the UA
would have gotten approval to build itsthree
telescopes on a sacred Apache mountain peak
covered in virgin forest (of which there is less
than 5 percent of original old—growth left in the
U.S.).

This peak is also home to 18 different species
of flora and fauna found no where else in the
world, plus nine varieties of endangered or
threatened species, including your friend and
mine, the red squirrel. 

When the UA’s environmental impact study
mysteriously concluded that that the plants and
animals listed as endangered would not be drasti-
cally effected by the project, many organizations
filed charges against the UA for providing false
information. Sure enough, after many hours in
court (and after the UA constructed/destructed a
road, began to clear-cut more than 200 old-
growth trees and broke ground on two of the
telescopes), the two biologists who wrote up the
study admitted, under oath, to fudging the tests
so so they would get the UA’s desired outcome.
But, since the UA already started building the
scopes, the courts had a “too late” attitude and
after a good.wrist slapping, let the destruction
continue.

Then, after millions of dollars were spent on
getting approval and finding the “perfect loca-

tion,” and after construction was nearly finished

because building at the present
location would be harmful to the
endangered red squirrel and insensitive to the
religious concerns of the Apaches.

The report also disclosed how the UA illegally
handled millions of dollars worth of bonds by
exchanging its tax-exempt bonds (which schools
use to build educational buildings) for high—yield
private bonds. Then, Pacheco used the profit to
fund much of the project, while publicly denying
it.

Basically, a few men took it upon themselves to
lie, cheat and steal to get this sacred land,
because it is cheap and conveniently located only
two hours from campus. This is the way I would
expect a money—grubbing corporation to act, not
a university. The UA has compromised every
moral obligation of an institution of higher learn-
ing in the pursuit of money and convenience.
This is not something I want to base my educa-
tion on.

Do you want 815 million of your tuition invest-
ed in such a questionable project? Do you want
our school to be associated with such an inca-
pable, conniving institution? We must take the
hint from other institutions (National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, the Smithsonian, uni-
versities of Chicago, Texas, Ohio, Michigan and

California State) that have dropped out of this.

every level; cultural, environmental and financial.

I would throw my two cents in. Shut up,

you, so I would like to remind you that

the right to free speech comes with the
responsibility to be quiet and apathetic.
Let us remember who is the president
and who ‘is the uninformed and under-
informed peon. President Clinton has
hoards of advisors, lawyers, economists
and family members working for him
who know more than you or me.
Frankly, what you think is right or wrong

worked. So now people are distressed
about Clinton; they're disappointed with
him. But the public put him in office,

ers to another candidate’s side.

I am looking for a working definition of par-

because we don’t seem to have one in America
and I‘m going to put an end to that right here
and now.

The whole issue of which set of parents are
rec!//_)' the parents of an adopted child has unfor-
tunately come to the forefront of our society’s
newsworthy events. I say unfortunately because
it simply should not be an issue.

. l I’ll say it once and if you need to read it again

then feel free to do so. Once a set of parents has

made the decision to give a child up for adop-'

tion, and the adoption is complete and legal,
then that child is forever the child of the adop-
tive parents and the biological parents have no

studies have shown that those children are more
likely to suffer from emotional problems during
their teenage years, such as depression, alco-
holism, drug abuse and behavioral problems,
than other children. Well, that doesn’t paint a
glaringly attractive picture of adoption. But let’s
not forget the numerous other studies that have
already been done that indicate similar effects or
worse on children of divorce, poverty, mental,
physical or sexual abuse and two working par-
ents.

This is why I say that our country is just a
shish—kabob of dysfunctional families. There’s
practically nothing you ‘can do anymore to pre-
vent your family from becoming a dysfunctional
family according to the textbook definition (and
Oprah Winfrey).

The fact that many sets of bio-
logical parents are now beginning

‘to challenge that notion at an

unprecedente.d rate is. quite sim-
ply, a shame.
Battles over adopted children

David
Matta

So what makes adop-
tive families any worse than
any other kind of family.
Nothing. In fact, going back to
how the notion of adoption got
a good name in the first place,
it’s better to grow up in a home

that spread‘ from the home to the
courtroom to television sets all over America can
only serve to mess up the lives of everyone in
question, especially the children.

I‘ve ‘spoken to several people who are adopt-
ed or have adopted children during the last two
gene.rati()ns, and their opinions have all been the
same. ‘

The laws of those times allowed for a substan-

tial sense. of security, for both the adoptees and

the adopters, that their new families would

' neverbe disturbed. At the same time, adoptees,

who felt the desire to find their biological par-
ents had the right to do so once they achieved
the ageof 18 with the understanding that it
would not be an easy search and there were no
guarantees that the parents wanted to be found.

But even if they found their biological parents,
that didn't change the fact that their adoptive
parents were their parents. It seemed reasonable
enough. ' g

But now biological parents who put their child
up for adoption want a money-back guarantee.
To me, and the aforementioned group of people
with experience in this area, this is a tragic
exploitation of the overwrought belief in
America that freedom includes the right to have
the right to c1rt).'tbi7'zg. particularly if you can find
a lawye.r advertised on television who is willing
to help you get it for a small fee. And people

wonder why I’m always talking about moving to

Canada.

Wake up and smell the java, America. We're a
country of dysfunctional families from sea to
shining sea, and now we’re allowing it to get
even worse.

Resea‘rch has been done to try and determine

the effects of being adopted as a child. Recent

where the parents want to care
and can care for the child thanin one where
that’s not necessarily the case.

Now, if you take that child lwho’s already at
risk for certain emotional problems by simply
being an adopted child, and throw him or her
into a custody battle, then you have not
improved that child’s chances for a more stable
upbringing than he or she had with adopted par-
ents. I
Parents who make the very difficult decision
to give up a child for adoption for whatever rea-
sons (After all, it’s really none of our business),
and believe me, I sympathize with anyone who
has to make that decision, make that choice for

-the good of the child.

Once that decision is made, it should not be
opened to a change of heart. I understand that
those parents share a biological bond with the
child, but that’s really all that they share. These

~ children have been raised and loved in the only

home they have ever known by the only parents
they have ever known: That’s who the child’s
parents are. , .

Legislation has got to be enacted to insure that
the rash ‘of court cases with biological parents
fighting to get back their children from their
adoptive parents years later stops right now.
Fortunately, lawmakers all over the country have
already started this imperative task.

But even so, I guess I’m not so idealistic that I
think that the debate will cease even then,but at
least it‘ will be a little less tempting ’to parents
and lawyers who rush into
room to challenge the legal definition of parent-
hood.

I believe the debate on “discrimination” must end with
this issue of the University of Pittsburgh providing
health-care benefits to same-sex, live-in partners.

The axioms underlying the idea of employee depen-
dents are being exploited beyond reason. I think the
original basis for dependents was “family,”-and family is
preserved by marriage. Since the institution of marriage
is to perpetuate family, it follows that dependent-care
benefits are to support the health of the family and the
well-being of the employee.

If a Pitt employee is not married nor has children, then

benefits should not be provided beyond the individual

employee. If an employee is married but without chil-

dren and never had children nor intends to raise chil-

dren in a heterosexual family, then that employee would
not be in accord with a simple health-care policy for
family dependents. When family is the basis, “sexual ori-
entation” is not treaded upon. Since the idea originated
with family and not with “mate,” then this seems"to me
to be consistent and clear. ‘

Let us clear up the confusion about this “discrimina-
tion” clause in the University of Pittsburglfs Declaration
of Principles and avoid further jousting for benefits in
the name of political fights originating with those lusty,
pagan, pleasure seekers. '

Contrasting pro-life, pro-choice

A new tactic has emerged from the pro-aborts. It was
most recently displayed at the Operation Resc_ue’s “Cities
of Refuge.” . .

The strategy involves introducing a note of violence

. and a willingness to get arrested and locked up with the

Christians. Pro-lifers welcome this as an opportunity to
witness to their tormentors.

Being in the presence of believers gives the pro-aborts
a chance to hear the Gospel and repent. Abortion-holics
will typically surround the killing center where they will
act like idiots, make noise and create confusion, all in an
effort to “protect” theclinic.

The utter chaos they create is not conducive to killing

babies, and they contrast sharply with the prayerful

image of pro—lifers. ‘

By Ryan Buncher .
Senior Staff‘ Writer

Carrie Thornton first injured
her right knee in a skiing
accident when she was
attending Norwin High school
— where she was an all—star
volleyball player. She tried to
ignore it. ‘

“I was hurting after I did it,
obviously, but‘didn’t pay
attention to it,” Thornton said.
“[1] didn’t want anything to do
with it,-so I just let it go.” _

Thorntoncame to Pitt in
.1990 and even played in six
matches'for the volleyball
team before the problem got

 g to the point where she could

not just let it go.

‘.'It swelled up really big,
and I found out I had dam-
aged it more during presea-
sonland it ‘was pretty traumat-
ic,” she said. V

First, a routine chest X-ray
that_ the.players undergo upon

 coming to Pitt revealed an

abnormality in her heart. Her
aortic arch bends the wrong
gway. A rare condition, but not
a dangerous one is what
Thornton calls it now, but
then, she saw it an abnormal
problem with her heart.

A week later she found out
that she" had a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in her right
knee as well as meniscus
damage. Reconstructive
surgery ended her season.

Thornton returned to the
team as a reserve the next

season but still had problems _

with the knee.
I "Ilseem to have problems
with my knee every year,”
Thornton said. “Every presea-

Sumner transcends ordinary to

By Keith Pompey
Staff Writer

A national audience saw his
name thanks to his brilliant
play against Southern
Mississippi last Thursday

, night, but his life has been far

different from the typical life
of an American athlete.

Today in_ the world of sports
you hear of native Africans
who come to America to
enroll in universities across
the nation in order to to excel
in athletics, as well as receive
an American education.

Pitt safety David Sumner’s
experiences in life transcend

the ordinary.
Sumner, born in Sierra
Leone — 21 small country on

the coast of West Africa —‘

came to America because of a
tragedy. '

“The reason I came to
America was because when I
was 6—years—old both my par-
ents passed away,” Sumner
said. “My father died one day
 the very next day my mom
passed away.”

Later that year Sumner was
brought to America by a dis-
tant relative so he could be
adopted by his biological aunt
and uncle. That meant being

separated from his brother

Dwight.
“At first, I didn’t like
America it was scary,”

Matt Serlin/ The Pitt News

David Sumner's road to America was ﬁlled With tragedy and faith.

Sumner said. “Plus with me
coming to America, I didn’t
know the next time I would
see Dwight.”

To this day, David still does
not understand why his par-
ents passed away at such an
early age. _

“I do not know why God
took _my parents from me
because it happened so fast.

But it forced me to come to
America and play sports,” he
said.

In high school, he used his
six—foot—two-inch, 190—pound
frame to obtain varsity letters
in four different sports at
North Port High School in
New York.

Despite being an All—State
quarterback and safety in high

school, Su1nner’s best sport
was baseball.

Sumner was drafted by the
New York Mets in the sixth
round of the 1992 Major
League Draft.

Regardless of being offered
an $85,000 signingbonus,
Sumner opted instead to
accept a football scholarship
at Pitt.

“I think the decision I made
was the right one,” Sumner
said. “When things are not
going well on the football
field sometimes I’ll say ‘Damn,
I should have played baseball’
 but that is a part of life. In
order to become good in one
sport, you have to go through
some rough spots.

‘‘\When I look back, I
believe I made the right deci-
sion because I"always wanted
to go to college and become a
Division I athlete.”

His success on the football
field has thus far reassured
him that he has made the
right decision.

In his rookie can1paign, he
broke into the starting lineup
the last three games of the
season. For the season,
Sumner finished with 52 tack-
les, four pass deflections and
a team—leading three intercep-
tions.

Forhis stupendous perfor-
mance, Sumner was selected
to the Football News Freshman
All—American squad.

Often, most first—year play-
ers who obtain any type of
All—American status tend to
show signs of arrogance -
start neglecting what is good
for the team.

Sumner did the reverse.

While most of Pittfs students were set-
tling in for a new term, catching up
with friends they had not seen for a

_ while or just catching up on their drink—

ing, I was on a road trip to Penn State.
Itis really amazing that a campus

jwith so many people can have so little

to do‘. It did offer opportunities for
some interesting experiences.

There was the ex—Marine who broke
the boredom by firing shots from a
semiautomatic weapon at a construction
site. He killed himself shortly after his
display, but nobody knew that until
nine hours later.

That was a nice change of pace. You
have not lived until you have traversed
a parking lot with assorted members of
the Pitt volleyball team making seminer—
vous jokes about snipers in the woods. ‘

People locking doors of restaurants as
you leave hours before closing time
does not exactly inspire security either.

Adam Spitzer
is determined

Alex Van Pelt suffered it.

, Orlando Merced beat it.

Jerome Walton, Timmy Smith
and Joe Charboneau never
recovered from of it.

Adam Spitzer, Pitt soccer’s
rookie sensation last year, is
trying toavoid the plague that
has been known to cripple
careers and make trivia ques-
tions out of once—great athletes.

“I don’t know [how well I’ll
do], I can only do as hard as I
work,” Spitzer said. ‘‘I’m just
working hard  otherwise I’m
just sitting on the bench.”

‘The sophomore spent only a
game on the bench last year. A
first-year student coming to Pitt,
Spitzer overtook Kirk Brodows’
job as number—one goaltender

in only the second game of the
season and never looked back,
providing the backbone to a
defense that carried the
Panthers to a second-place fin-
ish in the Big East conference.

“I did well last year in the
time I started,” Spitzer said.

“Last year Spitz surprised us
all and played so wellthat we
believed in him,” senior
defender Bob Dyer said. “l\X/‘e
believed] that he’d come up
with the big save.”

Unnerving to some, the
deserved attention lavished
upon Spitzer was taken well in
stride by the New jersey native.

“I was just happy to be play-
ing,” Spitzer said. “I came here,
wasn’t sure if I was going to be
playingggot my chance and did
the most with it.”

“Adam’s a pretty level head'-
ed guy,” Pitt head coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “He had a

great year but he realized that,

it wasn’t all Adam. He had a
good defense and a good
offense.”

Pitt goalie hopes to block dreaded Sophomore Slump  

starts with the goalie. When we
get possession, he determines

‘where the ball goes.”

The ball was kept_,at least for
Panther opponents, in front of
Spitzer for the majority of the
year. The goalie recorded 12
wins and 10 shutouts —_ tying a
Pitt record held by current
Panther assistant coach David

T orrence.

It was a banner year‘ for
Spitzer, but more importantly
for the soccer program, who
recorded the most wins in a
season (12) and garnered the
most prestigious of all Pitt soc.-
cer awards — only the second
invitation to the Big East’s post-
season party (the conference
playoffs) in school history.

But the ,‘92 season started as
did most others in Panther soc-
cer history — nine last-place
votes in the Big East preseason
coaches poll.

No respect.

No expectations.

No pressure.

Enter Spitzer, primed to play
the lead rolefof Cinderella to
the Big I-Iast’s ugly stepsisters
—— an unbelievable story by an
unbelievable team in an unbe-
lievable season. Something that
before this had not been seen
in recent history. ,,g.

They won.

And won.

And won.

“We were just having fun and
things just fell intoiplace,“
Spitzer said. “As it went along

iwe’d beat a teamhere, beat a

team there, and everyone was
happy so we just kept playing
well together."

But, as Jimmy Buffett once
said, yesterdays over his shoul-
der and he can’t look back for
too long. The 1993 season has
given Spitzer a baptism of fire
— a 5-0 loss to Bucknell, three
goals scored on only nine shots
on Sunday and a tough Big
East season beckoning on the
immediate hori'/.on.

“No one is going to underes-
timate V15 this year," Spitzer
said. “They’re going to come
out gunning’ for us."

“Definitely, I think that
lteamsl won’t look past us, for
sure," Luxbacher said. “It will
make it more difficult.”

“'\\7ei'e looking forward to
playing the same style we did
last year  just knocking peo-
ple around,” Dyer said. ‘‘We’re
a strong team, were physical,
and we're just looking to knock
people around and get goals
now and then.”

Regardless, the Panthers back
Spitzer off the field as he backs
them on the field — with total
confidence and total abandon.

“We have a lot of confidence
in him,” Prex said. “He can do
the job.”

“Spitzer means a lot,” Dyer
said. “We have confidence in
him back there.

“He has been working hard,
coming‘ around real fast lately
[after a summer trip to_ Isreal

playing against their best club

teams] and will play a major
role in how we do this year.”
The .upcoming season aside,
Spitzer’s goals go beyond any-
thing achieved last‘ season.

Majors’ homecoming

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

Pitt’s football ticket commer-
cials are shouting out “When
Johnny _ Comes Marching
Home” these days. But after
Pitt’s victory at Southern
Mississippi last Thursday night
on national television, to say
Johnny is marching home into
this season’s opener at Pitt is
an understatement. He is
downright stormtrooping into
Pitt Stadium this Saturday to
face the visiting Hokies from
Virginia Tech.

The always mildly-optimistic
Majors stated 20 years ago he
had hoped to come home from
Georgia, his first opener, with-
out being ambushed.

‘‘We’re going down there
with the idea of winning, but
realistically, I’d like to know
we could come out of there
without getting annihilated,”
Majors said before his first
opener at Georgia as Pitt’s head
coach.

On paper, Pitt should have
been pummelled by Georgia
that hot Athens night on Sept.
15, 1972, but Major Majors led
his Panther troops to a 7-7 tie
that was as good as a win for
Pitt  and as bad as a loss for
Georgia. ,

The parallels are so ironic
that it’s almost unbelievable.
Pitt had a new head coach,
leading a staff strewn with
young assistant coaches, to
lead the Panthers in that ‘72

F

in the Towers Lobby or in front ofithe 9”“

, season. Georgia was rumored

to have taken the game lightly,
expecting a win.

In this year’s Pitt opener, the
Panthers were led by Majors
with a young assistant coaching
staff, as they again marched

into the heartland of Dixie. The

fans at Hattiesburg, Miss., start-
ed partying at noon, as the
entire town shut down to start
an early celebration of the so-
called biggest victory Southern
Miss was yet to achieve.

A column was written in 7796
Pitt News on Sept. 14, 1972,
stating that with all else consid-
ered, the Panthers were
extremely hungry in playing
“.the best southern team Majors
has ever seen.”

This time around, Majors
again led his hungry troops
into a battlefield where the
Panthers were outmanned, out-
weathered, outfielded and out-
eveiything elsed —— except out-
played.

After the Panthers’ victory in

he may pass up George

The headlines in The Pitt
News read, “Cats Bring Boos
Down on Dogs,” after Pitt tied
Georgia. Majors is quoted in
the story, “There’s no way to
express what our performance
meant to me.”

Majors’ congratulatory ring
sounds not unlike his remarks
after the win at Southern Miss

 

————u-—————————————————
A

last Thursday. His Panthers
were credited with a defense
dubbed “The Mad Dogs” due
to its relentlessness in tying
Georgia at Athens. This year’s
Panther defense in beating
Southern Miss should be
dubbed the “Wild Dogs” due to
its tenacity.

Let’s take a look at the blue-
and-gold time capsule and go
back and look between the
grains of sand at some interest-
ing tidbits and feel the mood
around the Pitt campus 20
years ago. ,

Now with Pitt’s victory (tie)
at Georgia, the Panthers were
expected to beat Baylor in the
Pitt home opener the following
week.

After all Pitt played Georgia
in Athens and tied a team who
was supposed to murderlize
the Panthers. How tough
could Baylor be when it had to

13

face Majors’ troops at Pitt’s
home battleﬁeld?

Baylor was coming off of a
42-14 drubbing at the hands of
Oklahoma the week before in
which Baylor’s head coach
Grant Teaff stated that the
game, for all intents and pur-
poses, was over at halftime.
Baylor’s dilemma the week
before served to give Pitt even
more confidence in its home
opener showdown.

About 35,000 fans were

expected for the game at Pitt
Stadium the week of the game

— a game in which the
Panthers were favored by six
points.

Mike Bullino was credited in
the Georgia game for his
defensive prowess, which at
that time was called the “Bad
Cat” award;

cooly said, ‘‘I don’t know,” and
began to laugh because he
truly didn’t know who would
play.

“But we have to play with
what we have,” he added.

Question number two: Will
Dietrich Jells play?

The speedy wideout, and the
Panthers only deep-threat
receiver, is also day-to-day with
a sore knee.

“He twisted it in a cut and
not a contact situation,” Majors
said of ‘Iells’ injury. “He has
been examined with the MRI
test, and we will have to see
howhis ﬂexibility is.”.

Jells, who sparked Pitt in the
second half of the Southern
Mississippi game with a 66-yard
kickoff return, is another player‘
the Panthers don’t want to do
without.

Question number three: How
long will Tim Colicchio be out
of action?

With Curtis Martin’s ot1tstand—
ing performance in the
Panthers’ opening game, the

news of Colicchio’s injured
shoulder has taken a back seat-

But a healthy Colicchio, Pitt’s
leading rusher last season,
would give the Panther offense
another weapon and take some
pressure off Martin.

“It is a little more than a
slight separation,” Majors said
of the tailback’s shoulder. “And
he hasn’t healed as ‘quickly as
the trainer thought. Right now
he is doubtful for Saturday.”

And the next Saturday?

“He could make progress in
the next two days and be ready
this Saturday,” Majors said. “But
right ‘now I don’t know.”

The injuries and question
marks for "this week’s game
against Virginia Tech do not
make Pitt’s second game any
easier.

The Panthers will have to
scrap like they did on ESPN
nine days earlier.

And that leads to the fourth
mystery.

Question number four: Will
Pitt continue to scratch and
claw for the win?-

It was more than just pure
emotion and the triumphant
return of Majors that posted the
14-10 victory over Southern
Mississippi.

“We had no turnovers,”
Majors said. “Protecting the ball
was one positive aspect of the
game.”

Another was the hustle and
determination Pitt showed.

“We had our backs against

the wall and we fought back,”

Majors said. “We showed a lot
of intensity.”

But 10 opponents, including
powerhouses like Ohio State,
Miami, Syracuse and Notre
Dame, still loom on the

Panthers’ horizon. The season

is still early and it isn’t going to
get any easier.
“We’re still fighting an uphill

battle,” Majors said. “I don’t see‘

any team on our schedule that

we can line up against and.

beat. . ’
"We will have to be resource-
ful.”

There was no humor in that

year he is a real team play-
er." ‘He helps the freshmen
out all the time.

“He is a leader for the sec-
ondary and for the whole
team.”

He showed his leadership
on the field by racking up
four tackles, two pass

if deflections and a game-sav-
ing interception.

Sumner showed real lead-
ership after the game by
refusing to be complacent.

“Looking at the film, I
should have made a lot
more plays,” Sumner said. “I
played lackadaisically. I was
too passive  not aggressive
enough.

You can bet Summer will
play his heart out Saturday.

This weekend’s game ver-
sus the Hokies represents
the first time he will ‘play
against his best friend,
reserve cornerback Okesa
Smith.

“When Saturday comes, I
will be pretty geared up
about the game,” Sumner
said. “This game will be
bragging rights between our
families. All summer his
family has been telling mine
that Virginia Tech is going
to kick our [butts]. We will
have to wait till Saturday
night to see the final out-
come.”

Regardless of the out-
come, defensive back coach
Tim Lewis said that Sumner
will be a force to reckon
with in the near future.

“Dave is a very good ath-
lete who is intelligent and
has a tremendous amount of
desire,” Lewis said. “With
those three elements put
together, his potential will
be unlimited. .

“If he does what he has to
do, which is take care of
business, people will hear
about him all the way in
California.”

“As a staff, we met before the
season and evaluated who we
thought we needed to have on
the floor to be successful,”
Braziel said. “With Carrie’s
experience and technical abili-
ties, we felt  we had to have
her on there at some point.
We’ve really been focusing on
building her confidence. It’s
been a real positive cycle. The
more we build her up, the bet-
ter she plays. Now she’s start-
ing to believe in herself
because she knows that we do.
It’s just a combination of a lot
of things coming together after
a number of years.”

Those pieces came together
as the Panthers opened their
season at the Penn State
Classic. Middle hitter Alyssia
Yanik was already out, and set-
ter Annemarie Mernagh was
questionable with leg prob-
lems. Pitt’s top player, senior

Ann Marie Lucanie, injured her .

Already intrenched in
Pitt’s sports history, he
isn’t about to throw in
the proverbial towel and
walk out on top.

But then again, he’s
not out to smash every
record that stands — soc-
cer or otherwise.

“Hopefully I’ll be
known for playing soc-
cer, but I‘m not out here
for that,” he said. “I’m
out here to get an educa-
tion.” _

And an education isn’t
that bad an idea if he
happens to go the way of
a Walton. Smith or
Charboneau.

Pitt’s interim director of the
Golden Panthers, excitement
was high among alumni and
boosters following the Georgia
game, and all hoped for noth-
ing less than a win in the home
opener against Baylor.

Majors asked the Pitt fans to
take the cue from the players
and join them in holding up
four fingers at the beginning of
the fourth quarter to show
everybody that the Panthers are
very much alive. ' '

This was an interesting con-
cept, but it was not enough, as
the Panthers fell to Baylor 20-
14 in Pitt"s home opener 20
years ago.

Johnny is definitely marching
home — as he stated when he
told announcer Bill I-Iillgrove
on the. golf course in 1979 that
his biggest regret was leaving
Pittsburgh, and Majors is

expecting a hearty welcome

after the win, at Southern Miss.
Let’s hope the similarity stops
there, and Pitt comes away this

year with a win in its home

openen

which limited her all weekend.

With veterans Lucanie and
Mernagh sidelined against a
powerful Nebraska team,
Thornton took over as a consis-
tent offensive player.

“l.Thornton] took it upon her-
self to play hard in the absence
of. two lof the team’sl older
players," Begor said. “That’s
what you are supposed to do
when you are an upperclass-
man."

When Lucanie returned and
had an outstanding match
against Southern Illinois,
Thornton was still a key — this
time in a Pitt victory.

“She got us out of some jams
in that SIU match,” Braziel said.
“She took charge at the end of
that second game. I’m not sure
we would have won it [without
her]. Everyone was just backing
off and she just took charge
offensively.

“We were up 14-10, and all
of a sudden we could pass a
free [easily played] ball.
Someone had to say ‘I want the
ball and I’m going to be the

Thornton put away a kill for

a sideout, then dug a ball to set
up Pitt’s game-winning point.

Braziel pointed out the
importance of someone other
than Lucanie being a leader.

“I'm happy for her because I
know she’s wanted to be at this
point and just hasn’t quite fig-
ured out how to get there until
now,” Braziel said. “I think we
are that much better now,
because she’s never been in
that role before. Now that she
is, it’s going to lift the team a
notch if we can count on her
like this the entire season.”

Having a good opening

weekend adds to the positive‘

cycle Braziel pointed to.

“I’m a lot more confident in
myself, knowing that I can do
that every week. That I can go
out there and give 100 per-
cent,” Thornton said. “I went
out and played my game. I
didn’t worry about anything.
[Before] ’I’d screw  up
because I was thinking too
much. [Last weekend] I just
went out there and played the
game. I guess that's the way
you have to do it.
