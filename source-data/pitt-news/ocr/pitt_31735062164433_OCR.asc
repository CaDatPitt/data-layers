Students Respond to Request
  For University Honor Code

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

In response to Professor Lawrence Lee’_s
request for an honor code, in Friday’s issue

of The Pitt News, various students and I

faculty members were polled on their re-
action to such a code.

There was a deﬁnite consistency in the
reply, “It won’t Work.” Most of those stu-
dents questioned also refused to stand by their
statements by allowing their names to be used.

One girl commented, “The caliber of students
is not high enough. They wouldn’t even compre-
hend what an honor code is.” Backing her up,
Barbara Sabo, Liberal Arts freshman, added,
“There isn’t enough ritual, enough tradition in
this school for it to work.” ‘

“The impersonality of the school,’ of the ad-
ministration, of the faculty would have to be
broken down in order for such a code to work,”
Stu Schwartzstein, LA freshman, pointed out. A_r-
thur'Haag, LA ’68, emphasized, “Until people are
willing to work for their chosen profession and
the subjects they take correlate with this, they
have no responsible feeling towards subjects they
have no desire to learn.”

ISO Brother - Sister
Applications Available

Applications are now available for students who wish
to be brothers or sisters to foreign students next year. In
its third year of operation_by the International Students’
Organization, the program seeks to give exchange students
a true impression of the United States through acquaint-

ance with American students.

There are approximately 80 American students partici-

pating in the program at present,

On the positive side, and the only favorable
viewpoint on a proposed honor code, a freshman
stated that she thought it “might change the over-
all atmosphere and attitude of the students, and
thereby place cheating in .a position of really
going against the academic code.”

A senior boy philosophized, “An honor code
here is like romantic love-—something to speak
of with sighs and glassy-eyed gazes ﬁxed heaven-
ward. Everyone should give it a try, though, be-
fore being disillusioned.”

William A. Nagle, a teaching fellow in English.
replied that the effect of an honor code ‘Frests
on unanimity, a difficult ‘word at any school.”

He added, “When I support the code, I do
not overlook the pressure of academic life or the
fact that some students would subscribe merely
to be on the right side. I feel, though, that if stu-
dents were challenged in this way, a beneﬁcial
reaction would be more widespread and deep-
seated than is commonly assumed.”

Another senior commented, “Although there is
no living organic tradition here at Pitt, I see no
reason why cheating violations could not be re-
ferred to a student judicial council, which ‘would
make binding decisions.”

Chairman of Trustees
Plans Reappraisal of
State College Proposal

Gwilym A. Price, chairman of the University Board of
Trustees, revealed over the weekend that he ‘believes the
time has come to re-evaluate the proposal that the Univers-
ity should become a state institution. It is reliably reported
that other trustees also favor such a policy review.

In a Thursday editorial, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
urged the University to convert itself into a. public univers-
ity. Speciﬁcally, the editorial requested that the University

“rethink its future from two
viewpoints: the ﬁnancial uncer-
tainities facing private institu-
tions ' of higher learning (and)
increasing pressures for mo re
public institutions offering high-
er learning to greater numbers
at lower costs.”

- As to the University of Pitts-I

burgh becoming a state univer-
sity or a “state-related” univer-
sity, such as Temple in Philadel-
phia, Price replied: “I don’t say
I agree. I don’t say that I dis-
agree.” Priced noted that he will,
however, ask that an educational
policies committee be reactivated
and that the executive committee
of Trustees sit with it to compose
a new charter. ,

In December, Price was asked
by the State Council of Higher
Education whether the Univer-
sity would ever consider state
university status and replied
“only if the community no long-
er supported us in the kind of
institution we want to have, and
even then to apply for state uni-
versity would be a last resort.”

According to the Post-Gazette,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld conﬁrmed
three years ago that the Univer-
sity had given some considera-
tion to state university status.
“We are pretty deﬁnitely of the
opinion,” he said at that time,
“that we should remain a pri-
vate institution.” Dr, Litchﬁeld
was in the Virgin Islands last
week and was therefore unavail-
able for comment. A

State Senator Albert R. Pe-
chan, republican from Ford City,
a trustee both at the University
and at Indiana State College,

doubts that the University‘ will’

become a state university. Sena-
tor Pechan, who has led a move-
ment to make Indiana a state
university, nevertheless would
back such a conversion “one-
thousand per cent.” He said he
sees no reason why both schools
could not become state univer-
sities.

The Board of Trustees is meet-
ing this week and will presum-
ably consider the Price proposal.

Institution  

Trustee Gwilym Price is making an important suggestion to the Board of Trustees
this week—that the University reactivate its educational policies committee ‘to examine
the school's, status as a private institution.

Price, with the full support of a recent Post-Gazette editorial, is proposing that
the University should at least examine the possibility of becoming a state institution.
Though Lawrence Monnett, vice-chancellor of business affairs, has said that the ﬁnancial
situation of the University is not so dire as is commonly thought, there is widespread

. agreement that it is time for a re-evluation of the University’s goals which include long-
- range ﬁnancial plans just as there has been a re-evaluating of the immediate budget

situation this year.

The lengthy Post-Gazette editorial endorsed the University becoming a state insti-
tution for exactly this point of ﬁnancial uncertainty, as well as the increasing pressure
for more public institutions of this sort. And although both Litchﬁeld and Price have
hinted that this status would be a last resort, Price was recently quoted as saying that
though he doesn’t say he agrees he also doesn’t disagree with the idea — an indirect
answer to be sure, but one indicating that it might be time to look again at the proposal.

Despite the ﬁnancial benefits of the status, however, there might be some other

* riders which are keeping the Chancellor and the Board of Trustees slightly wary. A]-
through the Post-Gazette cited Berkeley, Michigan, and a few others as top-notch state
‘schools, this could be seen as the exceptions next to the many mediocre to poor state
institutions. There might also be a chance of threat to the University’s academic free-
dom: the loyalty oath required in California duringthe 1950’s is a case in point. This is
only one political tie that could be exerted—-unless Harrisburg is extremely sympathetic.

There is also the very real possibility that the State of Pennsylvania is in no posi-

tion to back an institution the s

year budget.

ize of the University which carries a 60 million dollar 3.

But there are pros and cons on both sides: it remains for the University to assess
its needs, .and Price's suggestion comes none too soon.

mean to infer this is the
typical University student.
The Air Force Academy has
not transfered its problems
to the Oakland area of Pitts-

_ IF THERE was a wide-

bother to sit in the Com-

the booths at Langley Li-

cheating there would be no
need for the Towers cafe-

room during ﬁnals week and
there would be no reason for

the Honors program and the
manifold national honorary
societies established at the
University show that there
is an ever-increasing number
of able scholars coming here
each year. ~

We must not loose our per_

We must remember the hun-

CHEATING IS like a small

stagnant cancer upon the
body of the students. It does
not grow in size, but because

it is there we are‘ constantly;
reminded of it. Because peo-

malignancy is spreading all
over us.

Of all the comments made

on the subject of cheating
the words of Dean of Stu-

clearest. She said, “I would
prefer to depend on a. body
of public opinion that holds
people to high standards.”
We as the students of the
University must form this
body’ of opinion. When we
see cheating we must not
condone it. We must come to
think of it as a crime, a
form of academic robbery
which che-apens every one of
us simply because we allow
it to exist. If we hold to-
gether as a body of thought,
urging fellow students not
to cheat and condemning
them when they do, this can-
cer will surely disappear.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Re the article “World History

feel this is a refreshing piece of
conservative writing in compari-
son with the ultra-liberal arti-
cles which are usually found in
The Pitt News. Mr. D’Ippo1ito
should indeed be commended for
his satiric commentary on what
is slowly becoming reality.

We sincerely hope that more

such articles are included in The
Pitt News in the future so as to
give both political viewpoints to
the readers. ‘

Fault Found
With Column

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is hard to know where to
begin to criticize ‘Alex D’Ippo1-
ito’s “World History Reversed.”
However, may I suggest that his
love of war movies and ﬂare for
the dramatic have swept him off
his feet. I think if he concerned
himself more with the intention
rather than the ‘words of our
founding fathers he would con-
centr.ate less on means than goals.

In fact, if he (and other mod-
ern “patriots”) would read the
preamble to our constitution they
might be drawn to the strange
idea that the revolution was
fought to establish this document
rather than provide w.ar-monger
phrases for text books.

This document (the Preamble)
is hardly a call to arms for the
destruction of other men’s at-
tempted political systems, nor is
there any mention of making the
jungles of the world safe for
American capitalism; there is not
even the mention of “total vic-
tory” (whatever that may mean).

Perhaps in criticizing the trend
towards a view of peace as an
ultimate good, Mr. D’Ippo1ito was
subconsciously thinking of Nine-
teen Eighty-four with absolute
faith in Big Brother and the
absolute evil of the enemy, either
Eastasia or Eurasia.

In fact, I was very surprised
that there were no selections in

must be, because the places re-

Pittsburgh concert-goers heard Istan
-,vKertesz, guest conductor of the Pittsburgh
Symphony in a long and ambitious program
last weekend. Claudio Arrau, Chile’s one-
time child prodigy, was guest soloist in
Chopin’s piano concerto in E-minor.
The concert had its u_ps and downs. Ker-
'tesz started off in Kodaly’s “Variations on a Hun-
garian Folksong, the Peacock” with a beat as
steady as a metronome’s. He seemed particularly
X attuned to the ﬂavor and character of the piece,
bringing out its inherent rhythmic strength and
harmonic scoring. ,

The variations shift in temperament from
vigorous dance-like tempo to the more peaceful
tempi, such as the reﬂective andante espressivo
variation with its lovely interplay between mem-
bers of the woodwind section. The piece is de-

‘ manding of the brass and woodwind sections, and
the audience began to understand early in the
concert that Kertesz likes a big, bold sound.

The orchestra responded in kind and anyone
who attended the concert can testify that the
Pittsburgh Symphony is quite capable of produc-
ing such a sound, as well as stirring pianissimos.
As the evening progressed, however, Kertesz seem-
edto become ‘obsessed with a large sound and in
Brahms’ “Fourth Symphony in E Minor,” Kertesz

 nearly blew the audience out of the hall.

A case could be made for ‘his interpretation of
Brahms’ symphony since the musical score
clearly indicates when all sections are to play dou-
ble forte (very loud). Kertesz seemed merely to
oe complying with the dictates of the score. As
double forte is the loudest dynamic marking in
the entire piece, one could argue that this was
the ultimate‘ in volume that Brahms originally
intended, and that to “let all the horses out of
the barn” under those circumstances  estheti-
cally justifiable.

1907 Opening Dramatic 7

Something still rubs the wrong way, however,
and the problem amounts to one of balance and
proportion. The brass section can outdo all other
sections in volume even though it is a decided
minority numerically in the orchestra. There were
times last weekend when Kertesz allowed the
brass to so overpower the other sections even
though all sections had the same dynamic mark-
ing that the unity of the piece suffered I as a
result. ‘‘

Although he evidenced adequate control much
of the time, Kertesz’ metronomic heat was mis-
placed in the Chopin and Brahms works, and I am
still puzzled by some of the retards he conducted
that arenot written in the score (measures 43 and
44 in the ﬁrst movement of the Brahns for
example). I

Arrau, world famous pianist, was able to re-
cover from a shaky start and play an acceptable
Chopin. Still it was undoubtedly not his best eve-
ning’s work and many of the passages sounded
too mechanical and heavy-handed. The concerto
is extremely difficult and one marvels that so few
technical errors were made, Some of the mis-
takes, howev er, were glaring ones that were born
of carelessness rather than of difficulty with vir-
tuosic phrases. .

Arrau’s rhythmic accuracy is highly commend-
able and there were glimrnerings of inspired play-
ing, notably the bell-like second theme in the
Rondo and the second part of the opening theme
in the ﬁrst movement.

The orchestra accompanied well. Fine ﬂute
work was heard in the Kodaly and Brahms pieces
and the horns performed competently in the sec-
ond movement of the Brahms symphony. The
trombonists had a ﬁeld ‘day in this work; but if
anyone’s ears are still buzzing. don't send the

doctorbills to the trombone section. Send them .

that Synge was satirizing and
even slandering Irish peasants,
especially “the Irish maiden-
hood." They were indignant with
the offensive work, which depicts
a group of villagers who gather
in the public house, drink illicit
liquor, and tell far-fetched tales.

Synge denied trying to mock
the Irish way of life. He wrote
the play hoping to portray the
wildness and extravagances and
even vices of the peasantry. He
wanted to show that these can
be attributed to the richness of
their nature, “a thing that is
priceless beyond words." Synge
claimed, “I wrote the play be-
cause it pleased me and it just
happened that I know Irish life
best.” So his methods are Irish.

Wendalie Henshaw in direct-
ing the Pitt Players production of
Synge’s work places emphasis on
recreating the spirit of the Irish
country folk through their rich
verbal expressions and lively
gestures.

THE JACK MARIN STORY

;. JACK MARIN plays’forward for the Duke basketball team.
«Against West Virginia Saturday night he scored 32 points.
V Against North Carolina State 'he scored 14 ﬁeld goals in
17 attempts. In another game he scored 13 straight field
goals before missing a tap-in. Marin tops the Blue Devils
in rebounding, and averages 19 points a game.
He almost came to Pitt.

. FOUR YEARS ago, when Marin was a senior at Farrel High
School, he played with a WPIAL All-Star team at the Field
House. After the game, Bob ’I‘immons asked J ack’s
father to bring Jack to the Field House at 9 :30 the next
morning.

Mr. Marin still remembers that day. “We had been
out late the night before because of the basketball
game,” he recalled. “I had to wake Jack at seven in the
morning so that we could make it to Pittsburgh by 9:30.
(Farrel is approximately 90 miles from Pittsburgh.)
Even then we had to speed to make it on time.”

The Marins arrived at an empty Field House. Only
two maintenance men working on the basketball ﬂoor
were in the building. They told Mr. Marin that Timmons
had not come in. So the Marins waited . . . and waited.
They waited for over a half hour for Mr. Timmons. But
he. didn’t show. ’

“THEN WE went down to Oakland by the campus to visit
 a buddy of mine,” Mr. Marin continued. When Mr. Marin

. was ﬁnally ready to trek back to Farrell, Jack turned to
him and said, “Let’s go see if he’s come back.”

So the Marins went back to the Field House. Tim-
mons had returned. But ‘he had left, again before the
Marins came back. That was the last’ the Marins heard
from Bob 'l‘immons about J ack.

“I had hoped the coach would call the house,” Mr.
Marin said. “But he never called to ﬁnd out what hap-
pened. It could have been a mix-up. He might have
apologized.”

If Timmons would have called to apologize, the bas-
ketball team might now have a strong rebounder. They
might not be 5-11.

' AND MR. MARIN wanted his son to come to Pitt. He had
"had 76 offers, and was well qualiﬁed scholastically. Jack had
a 1300 total on his morning college boards, and was the
Valedictorian of his ‘high school graduating class. He is
on the Dean’s List at Duke.

“I wanted to limit Jack to within 200 miles of home,”
Mr. Marin explained. “I want my boy to be near, so I
can see him play. I’ve only seen Jack play twice since
he’s been at school, and that kills me. _ _

“We raise them to enjoy them,” Mr. Marin said.”
And I was going to sell Jack on Pitt. It had everything

gran‘?!

JACK HAD been lukewarm about Pitt, Mr. Marin admitted,
but he added that the Duke star had been lukewarm about
< every school. “I just wanted Jack to see the_school,” Mr.
Marin said. “I’ve always liked Pitt. I was going to do the
selling. It could have worked out.” _ ‘
If it would have, the basketball team might be hav-
ing awinning season.

Weak Shooting, Rebounding
Hinder Hoopsters’ Success

ByFRANK SIVIIZIK

After 16 games it is clear
that the basketball team
won't be playing in any post
season tournaments unless
they qualify by defeating
Carnegie Tech for the right
to watch the WPIAL tourna-
ment.

Coach Bob 'I‘immons had his
team well prepared for the bat-
tle with Fordham last Saturday.
They worked well against the
zone defense but couldn’t shoot
to break it, which seems to be a
trademark ofthe Panther team
this year.

The leading scorer now is»

Larry Szykowny who has 239
points for 16 games or a 14.9
average. He had been shooting
better until the Fordham game,
however, he only made two ﬁeld
goals out of nine attempts. Bob
Lovett, who was averaging 16
points a game, .has dropped in
the last four games and now has
235 points for a 14.6 average.
Daryle Ruby is the third high
scorer and has been shooting
well after starting poorly. He has
been high scorer in the last three

games for the Panthers and over-

the season has tallied 224 points

. or a. 14.0 average per game.

After the ﬁrst three men who

1  La.VALLEY

are averaging about the same
number of points there is a sharp
drop off to the other two start-
ers Jim LaValley and Brian
Fischer who are managing six
points a game. Reserve Dave
Blyshak is maintaing a seven
point average.

Rebounding is the other big
weakness of the Panther quintet.
The leading rebounder is Lovett

who has captured 131 rebounds
this year which is an average of

BRIAN FISHER
Both averaging six points per game.

only 8.2 per game. This lack of
rebounding strength has been a
problem especially oﬂf the of-
fensive boards. There is very
rarely a second shot to make up
for the ﬁrst shot that the Pan-
thers miss 65 per cent of the time.

About the only statistic Where

_ the Panthers are even with their

opponents is the number of games
played. The Panthers have play-

ed 16 games as have their op-
ponents.

. Prepare for Navy

Trctcksters Improve Performances

By RON SHEARER

Nearly half of the track squad performed better in the
Army meet than they had ever done before.

In ﬁeld events, both Jim Flanigan and Dave Hangosky
did career distances in the shot put. A toss of 50 feet, nine
inches by Flanigan marked the ﬁrst time he had done 50
feet, and also set a varsity record. Dave Hangosky did 48

feet 11 inches, or only four inch-
es less than the second place toss.
Unfortunately, the distance was
only good enough for a fourth
place and worth no points.

Runners Fred Poellnitz and
Jim Studnicki had their best
times in the mile relay and the
two mile relay, respectively. In
the mile run, both John Bailey
and Damien Koch ran faster

than ever before. Koch also post- ‘

ed his best time in the two mile
run as did Dave Eichenlaub.
Hurdler Luddy Hayden and
sprinter Dick Crout tied Field
House records in their events,
and Bill DelVecchio set a new
record in the 600-yard run.

The track team has ‘a meet
"with Navy on Saturday. “We’ll
need a repeat of the Army meet
performance plus some improve-
ments to have a chance against
the Midshipmen,”
Carl Rees. _“On paper, the Navy
track team looks better than
Army. Besides this, we will meet
them on their home track.”

There are several reasons to
believe that the tracksters will

' give a good account of themselves

against Navy. If times and dis-
tances are good, individual men
will have a opportunity to travel
to the IC4A meet in New York
in March. In addition, officials at
Annapolis will be looking for
outstanding performers to ask to
compete in the Baltimore Invita-
tional near the end of February.
‘‘We’ll need good performances
at Navy to get invited to Balti-
‘more or to send a group to New
York,” said Coach Rees.

Wrestlers-Pose Best‘ 
Lineup For Cornell,  

‘f Lehigh, Penn State

By BILL CABIN
After Working ﬁve weeks with a_ depleted wrestling
squad, coach Rex Peery has his best lineup. “We have about
the best we can get now,” Peery said, following the wrest-

lers’ tri-dual meet victory Saturday. “The only place we
might strengthen our lineup would be in the 157 and 167-
pound divisions.

“If Riley (Clair) and Baily (Tom) could switch their weight di-
visions,” added Peery, “we might be a little stronger.” Riley now
wrestles at 167 and Bailey wrestles in the 157-pound division.”

George Huson wrestled in the 167-weight class against Michigan
and Syracuse, and Baily wrestled at 167 for the Michigan‘ State meet.
Huson, however, injured his back, and Riley has wrestled in the last
three meets, compiling a 1-2-1 mark. Huson begins workouts again
this week. «

Although ‘the team still holds weekly wrestle-offs, the present
lineup is: Tom Heniff—l23; Mike Johnson--130; Dino Boni—137;
Frank O’Korn—147; Tom Baily—157; Clair Riley--167; Lee Hall-
177; with Bill Bodle and Bill Beck alternating in the 191 and heavy-
weight divisions. ’

Lack of depth and sporadic injuries forced Peery to reshuffle
his lineup in each of the ﬁrst four meets. After losing six wrestlers
on transfers and withdrawals, Peery has been working with a 14-man
squad. Since 1961, the team’s average size hasbeen 23 wrestlers.

Besides the team’s shallowness, six wrestlers have had injuries
during the ﬁrst four meets. Johnson lost several weeks of condition-
ing and missed the opening meet, because of a knee injury. After re-
joining the team, he wrestled two weeks in the 137-pound division,
returning to his regular 130-pound weight class last week. it

Bodle missed two meets because of bruised ribs, and Beck did
not join the team until the second meet. Heniif had a. slight knee in-
jury and missed the Michigan State meet, forcing 0’Kom and Baily
to Wrestle out of their classes. Boni also missed a meet because of
a knee  ’ V

“We’ll need our best for the next three meets,” Peery said.
“Cornell has good men in the 191 and heavyweight divisions, and.
Lehigh and Penn State always have good teams.” The team wrestles

at Cornell Saturday. and at Lehigh and Penn State the folowing
two weeks.

Poor Undergrad Teaching

Today’s undergraduate stu-
dents “are being gypped,”
according to an editorial in
February’s Harper’s Maga-
zine. The students are not
getting what they pay for
-— good teaching, contends
editor-in-chief John Fischer.

Most colleges are capable of
better instruction, yet the entire
academic system is “rigged
against goodteaching.” And stu-
dent discontent is growing fast.
“It won’t stay bottled up for-
ever; and when it does break
into the open, the whole aca-
demic world may be in for some
distressful days,” Fishcher fore-
casts.

Students are becoming alienated
from college life. They are past
rebelling at the campus Establish-
ment—including their own un-
dergraduate activities and
merely ignore it now, according
to an analysis by Rosemary Park,
president of Barnard College,
whom Fischer quotes.

To ease the situation, Fischer
suggests that administrators con-
sider student evaluations in pro-
moting and rewarding faculty,
that alumni, parents and legis-
lators “tighten the purse strings,”
and that students “raise a little

"more hell.”

Fischer points to faculty dis-
dain for teaching, their reluc-
tance to change, and their lack
of knowledge of how to teach
well as factors contributing to
the low quality of teaching in
the college classroom. These are
coupled with the lack of an ob-

trators can use in evaluating
good teaching.

Such a measure could be pro-
vided by the student, contends
Fischer. It would be too radical
for our conservative educators
to accept that the customer, in
this case, is always right, But
“just possibly the customer might
be right now and then, so let’s
make a cautious, tentative effort
to ﬁnd out what’s on his mind,"
the editor advocates. Student
evaluations should be weighted
with research and publication in
determining a professor’s rank
and salary.

Students at Harvard and at the
University of California at Berk-
eley publish their own evalua-
tions of courses and teachers.
Fischer urges undergraduates on

every campus. to undertake simi- v

lar projects. Moreover, , where
students are slow to begin, the
administration should prod them.
At Harvard the course evalua-
tion is published by the daily
student newspaper, The Crim-
son. An even more reliable sys-
tem could be based on a group
of faculty, administr.ators, and
graduate students, reviewing un-
signed questionnaires ﬁlled out
by every student at the end of
each course, Fischer proposes.
The objections that students
might vote for the merely enter-
taining lecturer, and that under-
graduates are not mature enough
to recognize a good teacher, are
invalid, according to Fischer. He

-cites merciless criticisms in the

Harvard evaluations of professors
who are too entertaining and do
not present enough substance in

jective measure which adminis-

iAdvanced Art
a Study Course

Announced

The University has an-
nounced a program of ad-
vanced study in art educa-
tion, which may yield either
a doctorate of education or
a doctorate of philosophy.

Centered in the School of Ed-
ucation and the Henry Clay Frick
Fine Arts Department, the pro-
gram is an interdisciplinary
course of study, creative work,
and research. The ﬁne arts de-
partment at. Carnegie’ Institute
of Technology will cooperate by
its faculty,
courses, and facilities.

Dr, Blanche’ Jefferson, chair-
man of art education at the Uni-
versity, considers ﬂexibility a
major advantage of the doctoral
program. Art is a broad ﬁeld
with many channels, each of
which may become a lifetime
study,” she said. For this reason,
the program is designed to pre-
pare students for a variety of
roles in art education.

A brochure describing the pro-
gram may be obtained, without
charge, by writing to Dr. Theo-
dore T. Polk, University Office
of Graduate Study in Education.

Fischer also points out that
additional safeguards could be

Eight Protest
Asian Action
To President

Eight University students
sent a telegram to President
Johnson Monday evening
protesting the recent action
of the United States -in

The telegram read as follows:

“We deplore American air
strikes of the past two days
against North Vietnam. American
forces should be withdr.awn from
