' legiate journalism as we know it today is an
overly-paternal dean’s office that takes down its
hair at the challenging call of any crank or self-
appointed censor who criticizes a particular edito-
rial policy or judgment.

Constructive criticism is vital to the life of any
newspaper, but the kind that comes from preju-
diced, inane, childish, or propagandized sources
should be downed as quickly and gracefully as
possible, and then usually forgotten.

It should be remembered that a college news-
paper, similar to all newspapers, does not claim
to be gospel, at least makes no written claims to
that effect. Rather, it merely attempts ﬁrst to re-
port the news as it occurs or is about to occur, fac-
tually and in just proportion to its worth as de-
termined by the honest judgment of the editor, or
those in charge. Second, it should be the purpose
of a college newspaper to interpret, to explain, and
perhaps to present arguments on not only the
news appearing in its columns, but on a wide scope
of interests and issues, local, state, national, and
international.

It is neither right nor consistent when an “edu-
cational” group, especially a college ‘or university,
attempts to build a world of its own by establish-
ing walls at the extremes of its particular campus
territory. No university in the world would ad-
mit or champion such a cause. Therefore, an un-
dergraduate newspaper should likewise be con-
sistent with the best interests of education and at-
tempt to push the undergraduate barriers to all
known limits.

Many student judgments will prove immature
and inaccurate but that is the beauty of learning:
correcting, or at least attem ting to correct, yes-
terday’_s error, and proﬁting y the experience.

A STUDENT NEWSPAPER hopes to do little

more than offer student opinion in its “edito-
rial” columns. That opinion does not claim to be
the voice of the “masses,” though it does attempt
to strike a representative cross-section of student
opinion. In the ﬁnal analysis, however, the opin-
ion is an individual judgment. That is its only
claim to distinction.

A student newspaper can do much, we repeat,
to enlarge the scope of student interests, to select
the wheat from the chaff, to serve as the voice for
any student who chooses to advance an honest,
constructive opinion. With. only a few issues re-
maining and ﬁnal exams rushing towards us with
a note of both the end of a passing thing and the
beginning of something new, The News looks for-
ward to the day when-it can do all these things
to their fullest worth. Publishing daily, the paper
can further’ expand and the pulse of collegiate
journalism will quicken to the tempo of the throb-
bing journalism of our every-day lives.

The editorial staff stands by.

Charlesworth,
Graper Analyze
Court Plan

By ROBERT ADAMS

With members of the Senate Judiciary Committee still
debating on revisions of the President's plan for reor-
ganization o the judiciary, one of the chief issues dis-
cussed in the controversy is the part which the Supreme
Court ‘should play in American government.

A Supreme Court which will interpret laws in accord
with his political views is not too much for President
Roosevelt to ask for, in the opinion of Dr. Elmer D.
Graper, professor and head of the department of political
science.

“The plan for judicial reorganization,” Dr. Graper
says, “is simply a device through which the President
may be sure of having on the Court men in general
sympathy with his policies. And that is not new in Amer-
ican government. In past years, presidents have repeat-
edly appointed judges who agreed with them in order to
secure approval of their policies.”

Charges of “dictatorship” and “packing the Court,”
which have been hurled promiscuously by opponents of
the President’s plan, have no relation to the real issues
of the controversy, according to Dr. Graper. “These
scare words, like all the ‘isms’ about which we are being
warned today, are merely used as propaganda in place
of logical argument,” he says.

“Personal opinions of the justices," believes Dr. Gra-
per, “play a large part in the decisions on the political
and economic questions of today. Vague phrases of the
Constitution like ‘due process of law’ have no deﬁnite
and clear-cut meaning to anyone, and the justices have
been ﬁtting these words to suit their own ideas on
economics and politics. But, understand, I do not blame
the judges for doing that; anyone else as a member
of the Court would do the same thing.”

Despite the fact that he favors the judicial reorganiza-
tion plan, Dr. James C. Charlesworth, associate pro-
fessor of political science, believes that it is technically
unconstitutional.

“While it is undeniable," he explains, “that Congress
has the power to increase the membership of the Su-
preme Court, it does not have the power to make that
increase conditional upon the individual status or per-
formance of the members. ,

“If Congress is to alter the membership of the Sn-
preme Court after having scrutinized and found unde-
sirable the physical attributes of individual judges, there
is no question that the independence of the Supreme
Court will be, if not destroyed, materially curtailed.”

Despite the fact that he believes that the President’s
plan is technically unconstitutional, Dr. Charlesworth
favors its adoption. But as a permanent solution of the
present difficulty associated with judicial review, he
contends that there is only one .solution—to permit an
extraordinary majority of Congress to overrule the veto
of the Supreme Court.

Regarding the possibilities of constitutional amend-
ment, Dr. Charlesworth points out: “The addition of
substantive amendments to the constitution is unsatis-
factory because the Court can fritter their genuine
meaning away by repeated decisions after the public

opinion which forced them into the Constitution has
subsided."

Unionization

For years the whole country has wondered how the
city of Pittsburgh was able to escape severe industrial
conflicts in view of its world-famous non—union attitude.
The very nature of conditions previous to the National
Recovery Act seem ‘to be explanation enough.

Violent, prejudiced anti-unionism was inimical to all
that organization meant, or could possibly mean, and
it was not until NRA actually guaranteed freedom to
join union organizations, and outlawed “yellow dog”
contracts that labor in this area could even begin to
think in such terms.

With legal sanction, organizations began to prosper.
The United Mine Workers, for example, grew to liavc
over 400,000 members within several months. During
extensive organization in many other ﬁelds, all the
steel workers knew was more and more of decadent
“company unions.”

Such towns as Ambridge and A-liquippa had not seen
a union organizer in their entire history. Towns like
V andergrift openly boasted never to have known a union
organizer in their propaganda to attract industry.

All this is history, and now more history  being
written. The Jones and Laughlin employees, 30,000
strong. went out on strike. Pittsburgh and Western Penn-
sylvania experienced something that had not been known
since the great steel strike of 1919. For 18 years workers
have had their faces slapped and they graciously turned
the other cheek to be duly chastised.

For 18 years, workers have been mauled and brow-
beaten, have son their “buddies” ﬁred because of the
whims of hard-boiled foremen. For 18 years they have
sometimes been deprived of their jobs for causes wholly
outside their control.

And n-ow the wheel of fortune has spun again.
The workers of this area are on the move. Things are
happening. Union organizers cannot possibly explain
away anything less than a signed trade agreement with
J.&.L. Thirty thousand men are determined to gain recog-
nition of their union, and will take nothing less. His-
tory is being written in a big way, and we are in the
midst of it.

OW THAT EMPIRE statesmen have settled down to

the more exciting business of trade agreemciits,
rearmamenvt policies, and Imperial politics, it is possible
to get a somewhat detached, if cynical, view of the
recent British coronation. One side, the rather ludicrous
was presented in a U. P. dispatch from London on
Thursday evening. Solemnly, but not too solemnly, it
recounted that two people had died, some few thousand
had been injured, a dozen or so had been arrested for
street ﬁghting, and many hundreds had been mulcted
by ticket forgers, during the course of the coronation
ceremonies. Further the dispatch stated that tons and
tons of paper had been strewn around the streets, num-
berless thousand pop bottles lay empty on London’s
boulevards and parkways, and that night clubs and hot
spots had enjoyed the greatest boom since the halcyon
days of yore.

$3 * It
F lummery . . .

ANOTHER SIDE WAS presented in a second U. P.
dispatch which tabulated the number of paragraphs
given by London papers to the Duke of Windsor. The
London Times, obsequious as always, contented itself
with referring obliquely to the abdicated monarch in
an editorial. The Rothermcre paper went to the other—
B1'itish———extreme and devoted 14 parag1~a.plis.

But on the day following the coronation, somewhere
in the back pages of the newspapers was the story of
the opening of the Imperial Conference. Of all the
things which took place in London this week, the doings
of the Conference are the most important. It has to de-
cide policies, weld a half—billion people witli nationalist

sympathies into a uniﬁed political and economic unit.

IT IS A PREC-ARIOUS course that they have to steer.
With the world no longer as they would like to have
it, their business is to salvage as much as possible from
the impending wreckage. The king, object of the adula-
tion of a quarter of the globe, must be perpetuated as
long as the oﬂice proves useful; and when it is no longer

THE PITT NEWS:

By Milton G.

Jackie

Strange boy, they called him at the
Settlement House.

They found only last week that he
was head of the gang that had been
causing all the trouble in Harmely.
The amateurish swiping from An-
tonio’s Fruit Store, the brick through
the bakery window, the Windmore
girls who had been assaulted as well
as insulted. all these little “jobs” had
been traced to him and his gang.

His inislake. of COlll‘S“,, was in
getting the fellows together for a
meeting near the Settlement, and es-
pecially, in allowing Leader Hugo
Grimble to overhear them.

But Leader Grimble had a few
ideas about Jackie Martin, the
strange boy. No, he wouldn't have
him sent up to the Detention Home.
The boy was potentially good. No
one would have suspected him, and.-
although Grimble had his proof, he
wasn't willing to damn the boy
eternally.

And after all. what was the duty
of the Settlement? All the boys in

the gang had belonged, had got to-

gether for the regular Tuesday Eve-
ning Fellow’s meeting, played mush-
ball, swam, hiked together. And he,
Grimble, had told them at the annual
banquet that the purpose of the Set-
tlement was to help the fellows at all
‘times.

“You boys just come up to old
Grimble whenever you have any
problems or get in trouble. And then
we’ll just get together anti talk things
over.” That was what -he had told
them, and, what was more, he meant
to stick to his offer.

Certainly Jackie was wrong, but
he must be it goes! boy at heart.
Grimble would have been willing
to stake his gold watch on that.
He knew the boy well, had watched
him grow up, had taken him under
his wing just as soon as the boy
was old enough to enter the young-
ster’s club at the Settlement.

He was a good looking boy: blond,
curly hair, blue eyes, and, what Grim-
ble refused to call paradox, an almost
angelic face. A first generation Amer-
ican, Jackie had been born in Harm-
ely to a young Swedish couple who
had met on the boat coming over. His
father died, Jackie had lived with his
mother, that is, most of the time ex-
cept when he hung around with the
gang.

“Although Jackie no doubt led the
gang, it was probably the gangs in-
fluence that made him had,” Grimble
declared to Austin Pherson, director
of young men’s activities. “And do
you know what I think will do the
‘trick? I’m going to bring Jackie right
here into the office and call him my
assist.a.nt. Give him a lot of duties
and responsibilities, you know. He’ll
forget about his gang in a minute
and turn straight.” Grimble dropped
his hand on the desk, tried ‘to look
proplietic. “Yes, I'm sure that’ll do
it.’

Two weeks later Jackie Martin
was still. working as Mr. Grimble’s
assistant. Early in the morning he
got the mail and delivered it. Then
he went directly under Mr. Grim-
ble's protective wing in the central
office, acted as general handy boy.

He was gct:t:ii1jg along pretty well,
and Grimble had considered giving
him direct charge over a group of
younger boys. Finally he called Jackie
into his private office and breached
the subject. I

“You know, Jackie, I think you've
been doing a pretty good job. I'm
perfectly satisﬁed with your work.
Now I'd like to see you try some-
thing else, something I know you'll
like. We've got a small bunch of fel-
lows about ‘twelve years old, and they

To H il

Lehman, Jr.

3 need a leader. I think you can do the
job. What do you say?”

Jackie stopped a minute, scraped
his foot along the floor and looked
down at the carpet.

“Mr. Grimble, I'd kinda like to
talk to you,” he began awkwardly.

“Sure, son. Anything you want.
C'mon and sit down and we'll have

a little chat." Mr. Grimble indi-

cated a chair near his desk. The

boy sat down on the edge of the
chair, looked at Grimble a moment.

“Well, here it is. You‘ve been pret-
ty swell to me, saving me from the
Home and all that. An’ I don’t mind
working for you. But you see I just
ain’t built for the Settlement. An’
I've been tryin’, ‘too. But, you see, I
was talkin’ to the gang last night
and they don’t like the idea.”

“Why, what do you mean?”

“Well, it’s like this, First of all,
they claims I’m a sissy. After all,
I’m supposed to have been their boss,
and now I’m stuck here at the Settle-
ment. An’ if I started to take a bunch
of kids, a new gang, they’d be plenty
sore. An’ really, I want to go back
to the fellows.”

“Why don’t you bring your boys
here and let me talk to them?”

"No, that won't make no differ-
ence. Mr. Grimble. Sometimes plain
talk don’t help. You see I just gotta
go back to them. Yesterday Joey
got hauled in by the cops for steel-
ing old lady Donovan's purse.
They're gonna get in a lot of trou-
ble, stealing that way. Can't tell
what they're gonna do next. Don't
you understand, Mr. Grimble? They
need me."

Small Squad
Wins In Field,
Scores, 72-54

With a.small, but strong group of
point-getters, "-"Pitt’s able track and.

licld squad won its third victory Of L

the current year Saturday by Pacify‘
ing the Army, 72-54, at West Point
in a manner that, substantially, was
the same as had been predicted in
last week's Pitt News. ‘

Carl Olson only 13001‘ 3 16 “Ia”
squad with him on the West Point
excursion, and 13 of those tracksters
scored heavily to record the second
Pitt triumph ‘over the Cadets in the
past three years. ,The»13 scorers were
the same ‘group that has done the Pitt
marking throughout the season and
they recorded seven ﬁrsts on the
track, losing" only the 220-Yard 10W
hurdles. They also won three ﬁrst
places in the ﬁeld, the best they have
done all year.

Taano Surprises

Differing sixpoints from the P13’-'
dicted probable score, the ﬁnal Pitt
total of 72‘ was surlmslngly apfded
by the great performance of. (xene
Taano’, undefeated‘ Panther JaV_€11“
thrower, who rose to one of the high-
est points of this collegiate career in
defeating Sanborn -and Clark of the

Army with a javelin thrust that went.

194 feet, 1‘/2 inches-

Both of the Cadets that _Taano beat
had been instrumental in hijacking! his
Pen-n Relay Championship ‘a, month
ago. Sanborn won the Philadelphia
event and his teammate, Clark, was
third, Taano, somewhat paIned_ by 3
back injury sustained in the indoor
season, didn’t even qualify. The Pltt
star wasn't counted on for anything
but a third in-this event and his vic-
tory picked -up four extra points. .

The other uncalculated two. points
were made by Pete Bennett, Pitt high
jumper whose overweight has made
him impotent this year, but who won
the event Saturday. Bennett only hﬁd
to leap 5 feet, 9 inches to do it, and
Redmond _Oden, his erratic teammate
followed up with a second.

Routch Wins

Ed Routch, consistent Panther broad
juniper, jumped 22 feet, 7 ‘$4 inches for
an expected ﬁrst place. Gene Taano
added two more ﬁeld points by tying
for second in the shotput, more/_points
than the Panthers have made in this
event during three previous dual
meets. Rags Radvansky, ﬂoor star,
was third in the discus.

Track scoring went merrily on the
way it had been reckoned with only
one major juxtaposition. That was
made by Harold Tost, Pitt’s ﬁne cross-
country runner. Tost won the two-mile
run over such a capable runner as
Hubbard of the Army in a time of
9:-19.8. This race marked an excep-
tional comeback by Tost during the
week. In the meet with Penn State he
was only able to run six laps of the
race after which has was compelled
to drop out.

Tost also ran the best mile he has
done this year, ﬁnishing in a tie with
Johnny Woodruff in the time of 4:25.4.
Woodruﬁ’~l-ikewise-earned a ﬁrst place
in the 880-yard dash vwith little
trouble.

Best running performance of the
day was made by Art Thomas. He
won the 220-yard and 440 dashes.
Thomas ran the 220 sprint in a time
of 21.9 seconds. Dick Mason speeded
into a 10,0-yard win in 10 ﬂat. '

Golfers Split
With Cornell,  
State, End Card

Continuing to play its unpredictzible
type of Conference golf, the Pitt fair-
way outﬁt made the ﬁnal putts in its
sessions of Eastern Inte‘rcoll_egiiat.'c
Golf. Association competitioun by de-
feating Cornell and being "defeated by
Penn State. in a week-end of play on
the State College links. - ’

Friday Ha crack Lion six cracked the
Panthers into defeat, 7-2. Tony Kay,
the sophomore who has been scorcli-
ing the pars of every course the
Panthers have competed on and who
has been Pitt’s most dependable win-
ner, was the only Panther to do any
real scoring. He lassoed his State op-
ponent, Mahaifey, 6 and 5 and was
able by this performance to assist Rlll
Daddio, who was losing, to gain a bzst
ball point.

Trackmen Make Poor Maratho

Dancers, Says Pitt Trainer, Who Knows

Bearzi Massages
Cindermen,
Attends Classes

By lrv Bennett

Six years of travelling throu;;h the
forty-eight states of the Union and
the countries of Continental Europe
is good experience, but, says Herman
Bearzi, “give me good old Pitt.”

Bearzi is a freshman at the Uni-
versity, studying physical education.
Up until a year ago he vvas a t1'ainr=i'
for dance marathon teams. Now he
acts as a trainer for the Pitt track
team, and conducts first-aid classes
at the Lawrenceville YMCA.

“I! started with dance marathon
teams right after I ﬁnished Union-
town high school in 1931,” declares
Bearzi. “A friend of mine got me a
job with a troupe working Pitts-
burgh. We went on tour, covering
most of the states of "the Union,
stopping long enough in cities to- run
off a marathon. We liked to get local
rtontestants for the race—-good draw-
ing card. you know~—--but there were
:1 lot of teams that followed us from
city to city. It's a pretty holiest busi-
nc.=;s.” '

‘“No Luck In London"

By 1932 Bearzi had been ‘through
a good part of the United States.
Tll.Cl1'\’S'llGll the marathon outﬁt set
out for Europe, he went along. “We
didn’t have much luck in Paris or
London,” Bearzi continues. “The
authorities didn’t like the
marathons. So while the troupe was

idea of,

K-ﬁlooking about to get started, I took<

time off to visit the home town. That's
Udme, a little Italian village on the
Austrian border. It's a picturesque
Alpine village.”

This was l{erman’s second visit to
Udine, for in 1923 he and his father
went tlicrc. “We stayed some time
then. and when we came back to
the United States I couldn’t speak
a word of English. I had to learn
it all over agaiii. But, boy. T-l1‘3‘.V
serve swell spaglietti over in Italy.”
Herman came back from his mara-
thon tour of Uriine in 1933, still able
to speak English, he coi1fe.<ses with
a g:'i'in.

"Too Hard To Handle”

Up until  Herman stayed on
the road with the maratlioners. For
one week he ‘tried his hand at train-
ing bike i'a.cers. “But. they were too
hard to handle, so I gave it up.” Her-
man was with the dance marathon
team that kept the Duquesne Garden
in Pittsburgh busy for seven months.
about the longer-;t dance marathon on
record.

Then in 1935 he decided to hit for
home. He came to Pittsburgh, got a
job as a masseur in the William Penn
Hotel. He stayed tho=r«'~ until last Sep-
tember, when he lcftto come to Pitt.
At school Bearzi has found that work-
ing for the track team, odd side jobs,
and studying keep him plenty busy.
“They’re a svvell bunch of fellows,
these track men,” Herman declares.
“Carl Olson is a very ﬁne man ‘to
work under. As for running legs,
the pair that Johnny W oodruff
wears are beauties.”

" World Traveler
Prefers Pitt,
Olsonmen

Track men probably wouldn't
make good dance marathoners, says
Herman. They're built mostly for
speed, and not so much for endur-
ance. “Why sometimes, our dancers
just fell asleep on their feet. Lots

of times when they were out for a
rest period, they would refuse to get
up when called—-.i!.1St.ikeep on_ sleep-
ing. Sometimes we had to carry, 
bed and all onto the track.” , 1
As for massaging, track men or
dancers, it’s still the s.ame«jo'b. Blit
there is an art to massaging——in fact,
ﬁve arts. There are ﬁve ways to rub.
and Herman recites them all. ?‘B1_at
always rub towards the heart,” he
stresses. He feels there is a ‘lot he
can learn, and that's why "he is "a
physical education major. He has
taken correspondence courses and ‘lec-
tures. This summer he :is going up to
New,.York for a course on physio-
therapy; I *

a B average. "

there's an art to massaging.

Mushers Hit
Bad Weather,
Play Today

Martin J. F eely’s mushball tourneys
ran into two straight days of rainy

weather las-LThu_rsday and Friday and

as a result champions of the Indepen-
dent and University leagues will not
be determined until the postponed
games are played off today and to-
morrow.

T onight, the Buzzers meet the N ew-

man Club in a last-minute effort to
overtake the league—leading KAPhis.
The game is scheduled for 4:30 o'clock
at Trees ﬁeld. At 6:00 o’clock, the
Politicos, winner of the only game
they have played in the University
circuit, will play Forty Plus.
Q The tilt between the KAPhis and
the Buzzers, rained out Friday will
probably be played oil’ Tuesday or
Wednesday, as will the Dents-Politicos
meeting.

The rain also set back the schedule
for the fraternity league. The Phi
Kap-Phi Cam clash has been tenta-
tively scheduled for tonight as has the
second round game between the Phi
Delta and the Phi Lambs. This means
that the championship battle which
was scheduled for Wednesday will be
set back until the latter part of the
week.

Tennis Win
Streak Broken

At Penn State

Penn State's strong tennis team
toppled Pitt from the ranks of the
undefeated in a hard-fought court bat-
tle which saw the Lions rally in the
two ﬁnal double matches to win by
the slight margin of 5-4.

After Bob Madden and Ralph Bald
had taken their single matches in
straight sets, the State netmeii came
back to win three out of the next
four singles contests. John Mogan was
defeated 6-1, 4-6, 6-0 by Charles Patt,
who vanquished Naomi Thompson
from Tech last week. Mogan’s match
with Mrs. Thompson tomorrow willl
be the tennis highlight of the week.

Adrian Hartman was the only other
Panther netter to cop his singles
match at State College. He outpointed
Paul Perry 7-5, 6-2. And Arnold
Cohen from the Lion's tennis roster
barely nosed out Larry Blatt after
dropping the ﬁrst set 2-6.

In the doubles, again Madden and
Bald took their match though they
had a little trouble by 5-7, 6-1, 6-4.
But Mogan and Blatt missed fire in
their doubles contest and lost 6-1, 6-3.
Solow and Hartman were upset 6-4,
6-3 in the ﬁnal match. Pitt's last two
doubles teams were also defeated a
week ago at Grove City.

-:- STOP and G0

By Nick

Plioi.,Tbln. Show Good.

“Shall-We Dance”, at the Penn, follows the Astaire-
Rogers-Twentieth-Century-F ox tradition down to the last
tap. It is big and ﬂashy and shiny and smooth and so
on into. infinity.

Even the plot is traditional. It is the usual and
' thankfully-thin story of misunderstanding rearing its

funny head into the show. Astaire’s name is l'e'ter I’.
Peters, alias Petrov the Petrov, and the Ginger, well,
shlel had a nzaiie too, lliuthl forgot it, and besides I could
e it was 'inger a 't e time.
h Well it seemed that Petrov, or Peters, or Astaire,
ad legs two good ones. So did the rrirl. The difference
lay in tlie fact that l’e't1'ov_ was liigli-lbrow, and tin‘, girl
lowbrow, and somebody said that never the two .‘4ll0lll(l
niectit, or s.ho_n;etl1ﬁig or Ol;ll01‘.h But theyldo meet in this
picgure w- lici a goes to s’ ow you ti-at it’s a small
world and that somebody, who shall be nameless be-
causctehl3rdon’t know his name, was all wet or something
0 o .

Things look bad when they meet, however. ‘It’s mis-

understanding all the timc. The whole trouble lies in

the fact that everyone thinks ‘that Fred or Pete or Pet-
rov and the girl are married, but they don't want any-
one to think that. They don ‘t even want to be married.
It would be murder if they were married! It would be
revolution! What would happen to the three other songs
and the joke if ‘they were ll18.l‘l.‘lC(l in the middle of the
picture? Think about that awhile, and then you'll be able
to appreciate why Fred, or Peters, or Pctrov, has to
wait.

Tunes Are Tops

Everything comes to him who waits, however, or at
least somebody said so (son1ebody's been doing a hell
of a lot of talking) and after the three other songs are
sung and the remaining gag has been pulled Fred and
Ginger leave to be married. So, the picture ends.

“Shall We Dance” is a good picture. I't’s as good as
“Top Hat” or even “The Gay Divorcee". Astaire and
Rogers seem to be lucky in that they get the world’:-5
best creators to write their ‘tunes. First tlicy had Cole
Porter; then, Irving Berlin; and now, the brothers
Gershwin.

To say that George and Ira Gcrsliwin have been writ-
ing good music for years would be wasting time and
ﬁlling space, so 1711 say i't. They have. And thcy’re right
up to par in this -picture. Every song's a hit. “Slap That
Bass”, “Let’s Call The Whole Thing Off”, “They Can't
Take That Away From Me”, and “Shall We Dance”.
In addition to the good music Fred does more solo douc-
ing than he's ever done before, which is always a good
sign.

3 1i!

As Duke Eddie Would Say:

“The Woman I Love” is a war picture. I knew that
even tho I came in ﬁve minutes late (thankfully). The
ﬁrst thing I saw was a man in a uniform holding a
phone. I’ve always called this particular fellow Colin
Clive, but don’t let me fool you. It's not Colin Clive

Spanos

it’s some other fellow that I always call Colin Clive, see!
I call l_iim=that because it sounds English and he looks
English, but this pictui'e’s French. "So what? (That's
what I said too). if \ D

Well, this aviator in the unifornr was on the phone,
sec, and he was saying, “But that’s impossible. We can’t
do it in this fog. Oh alright, I'll call for volunteers.”
He kept his word, too. He called for volunteers. And
nobody would volunteer because it was foggy, except
l’aul Muni, who needed a shave, and some other lug,
who had just become a father. The other lug gets shot
and everybody looks at Paul Muni and says, “Jinx!”

There was one exception, a good, clean fellow who
had just joined the army. He was nice to Paul Muni.
So nice that when he went on leave Paul asked him to
go see,-his h(l'aul’s wife). The clean,-young fellow does‘
this and he is surprise"d-to find that Paiil"s‘ wife ‘and his

own sweetlieai't.ai'e both Miriam Hopkins. Mii'iam- looked‘ —

sui‘p’ri‘sed too.‘ln.fact-, all ‘thru the picture 'I- couldn’t
maiée sure» whether she was surprised or scared. If you
see the picture let me know what you ‘think.

Geometry Roars Its Ugly Head

There you have it———tlie Triangle. Muni, Hopkins, and
the young fellow. As fate and Hollywood would have
it. Muni and the young fellow both work in the same
plane, and, of course, it’s only a questioii of time be-
lore Muni learns all. You see, Hopkins comes to the
front, pretending to visit her husband, but all the time
:7-lie just wants to see the young fellow. When Muni
learns he is very philosophical about the whole thing.
He doesn't swear or get drunk or anything. He doesn’t
even shave his beard. He just goes on as usual killing
German aviators.

Towards the end of ‘the picture comes the Big Push.
You know, the final drive, the last effort when Uncle
Sam (or is it Mademoiselle from Armeiiticrs) expects
every man . . . Anyway the young fellow gets shot and
dies. Muni is hurt and lives. The last scene is in a hos-
pital where Hopkins is nursing llluni. Here she ‘thinks
ne’s doing too much talking and me say.-' softly, “Don't
say any more, Claude.” If only she’d said that to the
whole cast at the beginning‘ of the picture and ‘they'd
listened to her. Because the picture is poor is no rea-
son to stay away from the Stanley. Not while Benny
Mcrofl”s there. Just miss the picture and see Meroff.

Benny Apes Benito

Meroff, as you may know, was the guy who was steal-
ing the Sunday night broadcasts from Cantor; so Can-
tor went back to Rubinoil. Well. Mnrolf and his band

reels, is something to laugh at. '1"lic_v ought to give a

Dutch la puzzled. Everybody, liter-
ally ever_vbod_v,_ it seems, is getting
peeved. l’ersonally, We’re becoming
just the least bit sorry we ever de-
cided to write this Senior Ball pub-
licity.

Last week, it was Rauck. And
Rauck wa.:<n’t even nice about it. Now
it’s the committeemen and sub-com-
mittecmen and the dates and admirers

of the committeemen and sub-co1n-

mitteemcn.

One of them came into the office
yostertlay to. see us. “Bu'tch, we've
really got. a good rlancc scheduled and
you’ve ruining it for us. I’ve got

3 one question to ask. Have you, Butch,

ever been connected with a dance of
any shape, fashion, or form?"

‘We answered that the closest we
ever got to running a dance was to
act as chaperon at our sister’s birth-
day party when she was eight years
old.

“HOW TO RUN A DANCE”

“Then, you have no idea what it’s
like to run a’ dance,” the flunky shout-
ed, and sighed. “Ami you call us
‘flunkies.’ ”

“But this is ge'ttin_.r.: us nowhere,”
we pointed out, just an we learned it
from Mr. Ca1‘ne_;:ie's “How to Win
Friends and Inﬂuence People.” “Now
let’s have some news, if you’ve got
any.” -

“Just this.” the ﬂunky claimed,
after an obvious attempt at tl1inkin5:;.
“The dance will be semi-formal. That
means that the men will wear spring
suits and the women dance frocks. At
least, that’s what Rauck calls them.

“And then,” he added, “we want all
our ticket holders to print their names
a.nd their dates’ names on the back of
their tickets. We’re going to announce
the dancers’ names and present all of
them with diplomas as they enter.”

“And you might remind them again
that We’re having Johnny Martone at
the Twentieth Century Club on May
21 from 9 to 1 o’clock for $2.50 per
couple.”

“You mean the Senior Ball
asked.

“We mean the Senior Ball,” the
ﬂunky concluded.
