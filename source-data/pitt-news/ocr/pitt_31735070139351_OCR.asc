’ President George W. Bush

out the plan’s goal by quickly
spending the rebates meant. to
lead to a resurgent economy.
John Schmitt, a senior econ-
omist for the Center for Eco-

nomic and Policy Research, said -  if

that students are more likely to
spend their money directly on
goods and services because. they
live on smaller budgets.-

A “The people" who have the
lowest income will spend 100
percent,” Schmitt said.

- But the bill’s ﬁne print pre-
vents large numbers of college
students from receiving a check.

Students would spend rebate, In

Rebate, page 1

$150,000 and $174,000 will also receive
rebates, albeit small ones. Couples can
receive an extra $300 for each depen-
dent aged 17 or younger, provided the
child lived with them for the majority of
2007.

The $168 billion Economic Stimulus
Act of 2008 gives rebates to people, with
the hope that they will spend it on goods

and services.

The problem, critics say, is that those
with higher incomes are less" likely to

spend the rebate on goods than debt or
investments, which don’t stimulate the
economy in the same way. '

Sodexho employee John "Richardson
plans to spend his rebate on his family.

“My one daughter just made honor’

roll so I’d like to get her a nice outﬁt or
something,” Richardson said.

Pitt College of Business Administra-
tion professor Esther Gal—Or, however,
doesn’t think enough_people will do this
to make the plan effective.

“The government hopes that recipients
of the rebates will increase consumption
in general,” Gal—Or said. “However, in
order to pay rebates to some, the govern-
ment has to tax others. There is no guar-
antee, therefore, that the package will
indeed lead to increased consumption.”

College students who will receive re-
bates say they will spend the money on
anything from tattoos to plane tickets.

Pitt student Erica Marks said she
would buy a ticket to Italy..Others will

use their money on trips to Ireland or J a-
maica.

Other students said, they would use
their money just to pay their bills or_ col-
lege tuition. Some wonder if this defeats
the purpose of the bill, because the mon-
ey isn’t spent on consumer products.

“It depends on what they do with the

V money that they ‘ were going to spend

on tuition anyway,” Schmitt said. “That
means that they had $300 to $600 that
they were going to give to the Universi-
ty. If they use that to do anything in addi-
tion, that would stimulate the economy.”

Some students, like Carnegie Mellon
student Mike DeLuca, acknowledge that
the rebate, while" it may initially be used
to pay their bills,‘ will eventually go to-
ward entertainment.

“I’dlpay an extra month’s rent, prob— .

ably so that I can spend money on other

stupid nominal things,” DeLuca said.
However, economists say that a real

solution to the economic problems re-

‘quires more than “just an increase in

spending. V The stimulus package may
only offer a temporary ﬁx.

Schrnitt suggested that legislators will
have to meet again in the summer, after

taxpayers receive their rebates, to discuss

other possible solutions to the problem.
Gal—Or provided insight into what
these measures may include. ‘
“I do not think that the country needs

' this package,” ‘Gal—Or said. “Limiting

the role of government in the economy in
the form of reduced regulation and lower

taxes will be a far more successful way

to increase growth.”
The Bush administration’. passed a

similar stimulus plan in 2001, when the p
‘economy entered a recession. But some

experts are leery of attributing the eco-
nomic recovery to the stimulus plan.

Schrnitt said that the stimulus plan
merely shifted problems in the stock
market over to the housing sector. In his
view today’s recession is the result of
problems in the housing sector.

People who were borrowing money
against their homes are no longer doing
so, and thus have less money ‘to spend on

V luxuries.

‘It will be a few months before anyone
can tell if this stimulus will be more ef-
fective than its predecessor.

Pitt student Tegar Harrington ques-
tioned where the ‘money for the rebates
is coming from,-but. he knows for sure
where his check will go.

“I’d give it away. I’d split it up among
charities and give some to my church,”
Harrington said. “It’s not my money to
begin with.” '

ing _a smirk to her students, “no slipping

Puebla says she can see an immedi-
ate change for the better in students when
they transfer to the school. They experi-
ence something she calls the “honeymoon
stage” in the new, laid back environment.

Student Michael Irby, an 11th—grader

“I like everything: the teachers, more

Some students at The Oakland School
were referred there and others chose to at-
tend. Either way, they have left the public
school realm behind. Stein said, “If they
have the choice, they would never go
back.”

Though, The Oakland School has a
reputation for taking in underachieving
students, in reality there are just as many
gifted students enrolled.

There are no special education students

at the school, but many with learning dis-
abilities. These students are given one-
on-one instruction and are paired with a
mentor for support. ’

The Oakland School is not for students

‘with behavior problems but rather learn-

ing problems. Students with disruptive
behavioral problems will not be accepted
into the school.

NIU shooting reflects

U.S. culture of violence ,

Northern Illinois University

I was the latest of a number of U.S.
‘ schools to fall victim to a tragic
3 shooting yesterday afternoon.

The shooter, a thin white male

dressed in black, opened ﬁregin
 a lecture hall, killing ﬁve people
 and wounding several others‘ be-
i fore committing suicide.

According to The New York
Times, the shooter stepped out

1 from behind a curtain on a stage
' in a lecture hall and began ﬁring
' at the students and the teacher, a

graduate student.
Months prior to the shooting,

1 NIU faced several threats of vio-
: lence. University ofﬁcials closed

jsages were found scrawled on

;and included racial slurs. When
I the campus reopened, school of-
ﬁﬁcials ordered a police presence
‘around ﬁnal-exam sites at the
1 university. Clearly, NIU ofﬁcials
exhibited good judgment and

consideration in responding to
the ‘threats.
But since the tragic events at
Columbine High School nearly a
1 decade ago, the massacre at Vir-
5 ginia Tech and school shootings
last week at Louisiana Technical

phis, Tenn. and a high school in

Along with making campuses 5

Facts about eating disord

by Carolyn Gerecht

Colum/iziatwv =  -3,
  xiii

Last week, I listened to a very

 knowledgeable family doctor speak

to a small group of female college
students about eating disorders.

The issue, I was aware, is ‘a very
important one. But before the event, I
anticipated a* little bit of redundancy.

How many times can anorexia
and bulimia and the warning signs
be deﬁned for you? How many
times can we be told, “It’s no one’s
faultandIcan’tﬁxit. Ineedtoask
for help?” , '

Answer. not that many times. At

I least, not that many times until my

eyeballs shine over and I struggle
to stay focused Yet the infonnation
she presented and the discussion that
followed completely blew me away.

 Here are some quick facts so you can
3 see where I’m coming from A

Although they usually start in
the teens, eating disorders have been
found in girls as young as 7 and 8
years old That’s somewhere around
ﬁrst or second grade. Approximately
one out of every 100 female ado-
lescents suffers from anorexia That
might not seem too scary, but the
Princeton Review puts Pitt’s female
undergraduate population at about

8,734 (52 percent of 16,796). Thus,
at least 87 women at this University
alone sometimes force themselves
not to eat or throw up after their
meals. That is way too many.

Eating disorders have an ex-
tremely high mortality rate, higher

than any other mental illness. Five ,

to 10 percent of those sutfering from
anorexia die Within 10 years of con-
tracting the disease, according to the
National Association of Anorexia
Nervosa and Associated Disorders.
Some 50 percent of girls between
the ages of 11 and 13 see themselves
as overweight (in other words, half of
girls in a given nriddle school think
they’re fat). And some 80 percent of
13-year—olds have attemptedto lose
weight That’s a little nuts, I think.
Maybe — OK, clearly — I was
being completely ignorant when I
thought I knew everything about the
issue already. But really, whenever I

thought about anorexia and bulimia, _
I still pictured a Calista Plockhart

video they showed us in health class
where she suffers from bulimia and

ers shocking

family falling victim to such extreme
mental illness seemed tiny. ‘
‘But’ anorexia and bulimia, I
quickly came to realize, come in all
‘shapes and sizes (just like people,
ba-durn—ching). And the chances of
someone I know falling victim to
them, ‘I learned, were actually not
. so tiny. See statistics above and gasp
with me. Plus, the college lifestyle
comes with this heightened chance
of those sutfering from eating disor-

ders being able to get away with it. -

Between classes and opposing
schedules and busy social scenes,
it ‘can be almost‘ impossible to no-
tice that a friend hasn’t eaten a solid
mealin days. Or that she frequently
regurgitates it afterward It’s not so
improbable thatsomeonelknow has

one. And, even scarier, I might never

notice if she does, especially in the
case of bulimia, where victims rarely
actually lose any weight 9

What struck me above all else,
though, was the age range eating
disorders affect As previously men-
tioned, the doctor told us that while
it’s uncommon, eating disorders
have been found in girls as young
as7and8yearsoldYes,7and8
years old That’s barely elementary

Brooding a great way to impress

by Ravi Pandit
Colunmiat '

    
 

 

I was inspired once. Really,
I planned not to leave my home-
work until the bitter end and I truly
intended not to write this column

a few minutes before deadline. In
fact, I was so inspired that I was
compelled to drop what I was do-
ing and scour my brain for the ap-
propriate inspirational’ quote.
After hours of soul—searching,

i I was inspired-squared. My heart

pounding and. my brain whirring

with ideas, It dashed out poems

about my inspiration and grandi-
ose plans that would stem from
said inspiration. At the end of it
all, I was so exhausted by being so
ridiculouslyinspired that I took a
nap. And here I am now, ﬁlled with
a weighing sense of failure, devoid
of inspiration and time, which is
cause for even more introspection.
Why do I do the things I do?

See that? That was I brooding.

I’ve always wanted to be
broody. It’s a word that sounds
cool enough for me to want to do.
It means two things: “The desire
to want to sit and hatch eggs” or
someone who is “persistently or
morbidly thoughtful.” I’m refer-
ring to the latter. ~

It’s a very cowboy or presiden-
tial thing to -do. To sit there alone,
thinking great thoughts, inventing,

- reﬂecting —- it really lends an aura

of genius. Of course, brooding ac-
tually requires one to think great,
deep thoughts. '
‘Unfortunately, I lack that "ca-
pacity. However, I’ve ﬁgured out
several sureﬁre ways to appear to
be brooding, even if one is actually

thinking about Jessica Alba or that

sweet party on Meyran Avenue
later tonight. Which leads you to
ask, of course, “Why wouldl want
to appear brooding in the ﬁrst
place?”

The act of brooding is quite
mysterious: A brooder appears

unresponsive to external stimuli. I

Typically, his eyebrows are fur-
rowed, and his mouth is turned into
a slight frown. Brooding bespeaks

such intense thought that passers— '

by — especially the female ones
— are drawn initially by a desire
to be close to greatness. When you
fail to respond to their queries —
“Pray tell, sir, why are you sitting

‘in a corner, when all your compa-

triots are engaged in revelry?” —
and your face reveals no emotion,
they begin to doubt themselves.

Have they insulted you? Did,

‘they interrupt a brilliant -thought?
A brooder is inscrutable and mute.

In an instant, he becomes the ever-'

coveted, ever—desired, “strong and
silent” type.

Brooding implies purpose, and
thus you may automatically be
forgiven for not paying attention
in class or to your signiﬁcant oth-
er. The default brooder response,
“Sorry, I was lost in my thoughts,”

is better than explaining that you

didn’t hear the professor because
you were checking out the girl
in front of you or that you were
watching TV when your girlfriend
was taking. A brooder stares into
space, his eyeballs unmoving. And
if his eyeballs appear to be staring
at attractive females . . . well, that’s
just icing on the cake. Appearing
otherwise broody will provide a
perfect alibi: _You were looking to-
ward them but not at them. Your
gaze was turned inward.

So how to do it?

You really need dark eyes and
long hair to pull it off well. If you
don’t, then the act of joumaliwrit-
ing works well, too. Simply sit
curled up in a chair, scratchy pen in
hand, and pretend to be transcrib-
ing the words of your soul onto

_ parchment. It has to be a leather-

bound journal, and the more beat
up the better. The scratching of

the pen on parchment will pique
the curiosity of others, whereas an
inscrutable cover will augment the

‘mystery. Passers—by never ‘know

if you are writing a book, creating
poetry or spilling your innermost
thoughts.

The" more chaotic a setting in
which you can do this — a bus or
train station works nicely — the
better the effect. It also helps to
smile shyly at pretty girls passing
by, as if you are slightly embar-
rassed by - this public display of
sensitivity but cannot resist the
urge to pour your soul on paper.

In good weather, you can sit up
against a tree and stare off into the
distant mountains. Or, if there are
no trees or mountains in site, you
can lean up against a carmon on
the Soldiers and Sailors’ lawn and
stare at the Wilﬁarn Pitt Union.
Every once in a while, nod your
head and sigh, as if you have come
upon a revelation. Otherwise, peo-
ple will start to wonder what kind
of half-wit can sit for hours on end
and not generate even one morsel
of profundity. Remember, howev-
er, not to don any headphones, lest
people may interpret your broody
movements as jarnrrring to your
favorite tunes. Be careful not to let
“broody” be misinterpreted as “so—
ciopa ”: Blink when necessary.

Brooding is best done in the
early morning or at dusk, times
which society is considered to be
most conducive to inspiration and
reﬂection. If a rocking chair or
campﬁre is available, use it. If you
must talk, restrict your answers to
monosyllabic replies.

While actual, honest—to—good-
ness brooding is good for the soul,
fake brooding is good for about
everything else. Those who fake
it, make it.

Raise awareness about
eating disorders

Gerecht, page 6

to ﬁnd them in girls of ages 13, 14,
15, 16. Approximately 11 percent of
high school students have been di-
agnosed with an eating disorder, ac-
cording to ANAD. No pun intended,
but “gulp.” _

Knowing this, we all have an un
questionable responsibility to raise
awareness about the issue.

Eating disorders aren’t necessar-
ily a “trendy” activist cause, like the
environment or breast cancer (which
are both also worthy). There is a ten-
dency to blame the victim of an eating
disorder and assume that they chose
to adapt that lifestyle. But the truth is
that science continues to prove how
anorexia and bulimia arise ﬁorn bio-
logical causes just like Parkinson’s or
schizophrenia. ,

But anorexia and bulimia ﬁght
battle that many other diseases never
will. Dozens of online communi-
ties provide “support netwo ” for
young girls with the disease, oﬂ’ering
“thinspiration ” tips on staying thin
and encouragement in their journey
with anorexia or bulimia

Examples include brushing one’s
teeth instead of eating or placing a
picture of something disturbing or

a bloody, next to one’s food to lose an

appetite.

These young women, and many '

men, need our help. If you do one
thing today, tell a ﬁiend what you
just read about eating disorders. The
more we understand about eating
disorders, the better equipped we are
to get help for our ﬁiends and fami-
lies. And the more people ﬁghting
against eating disorders, the more
aid becomes available for those who
need it. It’s a race toward quality and
quantity. I’m lucky to be able to say
that I’ve never known anyone who
has suffered ﬁom an eating disorder.
Unlike a column I wrote last fall
about breast cancer, I’m not inspired
to write this in the wake of a personal
tragedy. But the infonnation I learned
fiorn that family doctor invigorated
me. It motivated me to spread the
word Don’t let the word stop here.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Five dead, 17 wounded. As the tragic details of yet another school shooting
oorne to light — this one at Northern Illinois University on Thursday — our
generation must stop and think about our current situation. As it stands, we
are the generation that brought school shootings to the forefront of public con-
sciousness. Colurnbine was unthinkable. The next couple of shootings were
sad, until they ﬁnally became routine. Virginia Tech was the worst mass mur-
der of all time and shook the entire nation, yet they continue. Shopping malls,
schools, businesses, all targets of the violent and uncontrollable rage that festers

among our genera1ion’s discontented.

While it may be the case of a few bad apples spoiling the whole bunch, we
all must accept the responsibility to improve our situation. And it starts with the
little things. Reach out to those in need with the same caring attitude that you
would hope others would give you if you were feeling upset. Tell people that
things will be all right, and don’t be afraid to offer them a hand Help to fos-
ter an improved sense of community within our living accommodations, our
school and our entire generation. It may seem hard to stop shootings altogether,

but isn’t it worth giving it a try?

High fashion
meets low

budget
by Julia Nauer O A
Staﬂ Wrtter

New York Fashion Week kicked off on Fri-
day, Feb. 1 and designers unveiled their collec-
tions forthisfallwithaseemingly endless amount
of shows, soirees and spectacles. And while I am
always eager to see what’s up next, I often ﬁnd
after browsing the collections I am left feeling
that the hot otf the runway looks are absolutely
ridiculous, simply rmwearable or just plain ugly.

And,I knowothersechothissentiment.
Countless times, I’ve heard ﬁiends while looking
at fashion spreads in magazines mumble, “Who
would wear that?” And while, yes, it’s highly
unlikely you are going to walk the streets of
Oakland with six—foot-high teased hair and black
eyeliner srnudged beyond your eyebrows while
wearing your bra on the outside of your shirt ac-
cessorized with rnetal-plated leggings canying a
bag so huge you could ﬁt a German Shepherd
inside, I’ve started to leam thatrunway shows are
meant to be just that — shows. ‘

They are meant to entertain, shock and hope-
fully inspire. Most of the time shows are very
theatrical with sets and music designed to 
a certain etfect Designers normally don’t expect
their clients to walk the streets in a head—to-toe
nmway look ﬁom their fashion house. I’ve heard
designers sayvthey are inspired when they see the
way a girl who mixes high with low and new
with old to create her own look.

Sothisyearwhenlquicklytookaglimpseat

overwhelmed and tried to focus on key elements,
or pardon my pun, common threads, throughout
the shows to try to draw out trends for fall It’s

As co-owners of a small at-
tic record store that specializes
in obscure music, Vince and
Daphne Curtis probably sound
like the type that would be all
for waging the war on music pi-
racy. When they acquired Craig
Street’s Brave New World, they
amped up the decor by painting
the walls in electrifying shades
of green and purple, stocked up
on Scandinavian war metal and.
rechristened it Wicked Discs.
Vince used to play in a hard-
core punk band called Half Life.
Both Curtises are big fans of The
Wildhearts and like to talk about
Pig Destroyer.

However, despite their strong
ties to the alternative music in-
dustry, neither harbors any hos-
tility toward illegal download-
ing. In fact, both believe it may
be beneﬁcial to their businesses,
thanks in part to an increasingly
popular phenomenon known as
track sampling.

“You*gettotestdriveacar,”said
Daphne, “so why not a record?”

Peer to peer, or P2P, ﬁle—shar-
ing programs and torrent sites
have made it easier for listeners
to sample songs from obscure al-
bums sold exclusively by smaller
vendors like Wicked Discs. The
Curtises explained that only 10 or
20 years ago, it was much harder
to learn about up-and-coming in-
dependent bands. The only way
to do it was to constantly browse
catalogues, read magazines and
attend shows.

10

“Now in 20 minutes you can
ﬁnd 10 new bands to try out,”
said Daphne.

The Curtises also believe that the.

breed of listener interested in the
kind of music they sell is natu-

rally more inclined to view CDs I

as collector’s items.

In a recent New York Times
article, Eric Levin, who over-
sees the Alliance of Independent
Media Stores, a trade group rep-
resenting 30 shops from across
the country, said many-smaller

  

record stores have limited their
inventory to_ obscure records,
hoping to attract music elitists
who don’t see downloading as a
viable option.

“As Brave New World, and
now as Wicked Discs, we’ve al-
ways tried to identify with a more
alternative niche,” said Daphne.
“What we’ve done [in response

Paul Olszewski isn’t sweating the

ers often come to the store after

interested in purchasing. Like
Wicked Discs, Paul ’s sells punk,
indie and alternative records,
targeting a demographic still
looking to build a CD collection.

“People still want‘ the physi-
cal album. Just lookat the new
Radiohead,” said Olszewski.

In Rainbows has been one of
Paul’s V best sellers, despite, the
fact that the band offered a digital
version for free online. Olszews-
ki explained that bands like Ra-

diohead continue to sell because .

they have a devoted fan base that
sees the value in a hard copy of
its favorite artist’s newest album.

According to TorrentFreak.

_ com, a recent University of Lon-

don study found a positive cor-
relation between the number of
ﬁles listeners downloaded and
the number of CDs they pur-
chased. The researchers estimat-
ed that for every additional P2P
ﬁle downloaded per month, lis-

teners bought 0.44 more CDs per '

year. In other words, someone
who downloads 270 songs a year
will buy nine more records than
someone who only downloads 27.

“People always like to listen
to something before they buy it,”
said Vince. “I think the digital
download just helps buyer conﬁ-
dence.”

Working for more than 10
years as an accountant for Brave
New World, Daphne became fa-
miliar with music-industry eco-
nomics. She said “big box” re-
cord stores like Sam Goody and
FYE really took a hit when Nap-
ster popped up in 1999, and suf-
feredeven more when iTunes ar-
rived on the scene and provided a
legal alternative to pirating. She

February 15, 2008

 

explained that iTunes appeals to
listeners who don’t View CDs as
collectors’ items and don’t want
to purchase an entire album just
because they like one song.

“For the mainstream music
buyer who wants the radio hit,
iTunes is perfect. It’s the absolute
perfect solution for the listener
who just wants the 10 songs a
month that they love,” she said.

iTunes attracts what Vince re-

fers to as the “U2 / Hannah Mon-

tana” crowd, people you prob-
ably -wouldn’t ﬁnd hanging out
at Wicked Discs or Paul’s, even
before the onset of downloading.

However, downloading, both
legal and illegal, has had _devas-
tating consequences for popular
music vendors like Tower and

Virgin Records. In 2007,» Big- '

Champagne LCC, a private re-
search company that monitors
the exchange of online media,
reported that 1 billion songs per
month" are traded on illegal ﬁle
sharing networks. According to
the Wall Street Journal, in 2006
alone, more than 800 specialty
music retailers, including Tow-
er’s 89 stores, were forced to
close their doors. ‘

' Less discriminating than
Paul’s or Wicked Discs, Dave’s
Music Mine, a used CD store in
the South Side, suffered similar
losses because of downloading.
Before the arrival of Napster,
owner Dave Panasiuk had a sec-

close down. The majority of his
clientele were college students
who no longer seemed interested
in purchasing records when they
could obtain music online for free.

-“For .me, downloading is
much more convenient than hav-

ing to go out and buy a CD,” said,

Pitt sophomore Ted Perrnigiani, a
history major.

that used to sprout up outside

on a brand new album. Dave’s
is no longer open past midnight
on Mondays because of an ever-
dwindlinginterestinpopularCDs.

Selling only used vinyl, Jer-
ry’s Records in Squirrel Hill is a
different beast entirely.

“CDs aren’t collectible in the
same way that vinyl is,” owner
Jerry Weber said. Most of his
customers purchase vinyl for nos-
talgic reasons, for the rich musi-
cal history behind a used record.
Many of the albums in Weber’s
store are 30, 40, even 50 years old.

“If you really love music, I
mean really love it, you have got
to get a record player. There’s 50
years of great music out there
that you’re missing if you don’t,”
said Weber.

While some people prefer
CDs and mp3s because they ﬁnd
vinyl cumbersome to store, We-
ber pointed out that the size of
records is often advantageous.

“Just think,” he said. “If
there’s a good looking guy or gal
on the front of an album, you get
to see that person twice as big on
vinyl as you do on a CD.”

Weber also explained that
playing a record at a party is
much more social than punching
a computer key to start an iTunes
playlist or popping a CD into
a stereo system. He said vinyl
brings people together in ways
that. other music media cannot.

minority of younger listeners.

“Not a lot of people col-
lect vinyl. It’s unique,” he said.
“Things sound different on vinyl
and there is something inherently
beautiful about that crackle.”

Weber doesn’t think down-
loadable music threatens his
business in any way.

“Vinyl is different because it’s
a collector’s item. I think it’s the
used CD stores that are suffering
from downloading more so than
me,” he said.

In response to the iTunes era,
Panasiuk has opted to limit the
amount of mainstream music he
sells. Adult alternative and indie
records are now Dave’s Music
Mine’s biggest sellers.

The demographic of Pana-
siuk’s clientele has also changed.
Now the majority of his custom-
ers fall into the 35 to 55 demo-
graphic, a" generation not accus-
tomed to digital music.

“I’d say about 95 percent of
regulars want nothing to do with
computers. They’ll say ‘I don’t
do computers’ or ‘my son has a
computer but I won’t go near it,”’
said Panasiuk.

Wicked Discs has also found

a generational gap in willingness
‘ to embrace the digital culture.
“A lot of our older customers
don’t have it into their heads that
they want to listen to something

 

that exists only on their hard
drive,” said Vince, using himself
as an example. “I like a lot of
things about a CD. I like the art-
work. As soon as I found some-

"thing I didn’t have to ﬂip over, I

was pretty into that.”
Though downloading has
been detrimental for Dave’s Mu-

The Pitt Nevvs 0 vvww.pittnews.com

sic Mine, some good has arisen
from having a smaller number of
regular customers‘.

“Now, there is more time
spent with each customer, be-
cause people still buying CD5
really want to come and talk
about music,” said Panasiuk. “It
basically comes down to weather
you want to hear the emotion in
someone’s voice when they talk
about a new record or read about
it on a computer screen.”

Even for stores that say they
haven’t been hurt by download-
ing, it’s impossible to entirely ig-
nore the effects of the digital era.

Record companies them-
selves, it seems, are beginning
to make adjustments. Olszewski
explained that several of the
larger indie labels have started
including a downloadable ver-
sion of the album along with the
vinyl, with the intent of making
their product more appealing to
the modern listener.

The Curtises now order all of
their merchandise online.

“I can listen to samples on-
line, which is handy, orl can play
a customer a sample here in the
store. I can also tell a customer
right away if I can order some-
thing for them, I don’t have to
wait for a catalogue to come in,”
said Vince.

“Before the Internet, there
wasn’t a way for people who put

out Pig Destroyer records to 'let
people who might be interested
hear their music,” said Daphne.
“Only the Internet has satisﬁed
that. It’s the only place people
can go to play and hear whatever

. they’re interested in and then,

hopefully, ﬁnd a place to go and
buy it.”

problem at all.

backup singers, than you better believe some
singers will pile in DSO’s tour van. And with
more than 1,500 shows of the Dead’s 3,500
under their belt, they’ve still got a ways to go.

“Most people regard‘ the ’70s as the

An injury-riddled Pitt will get its
star point guard Levance Fields back
when it travels to take on conference-
foe Marquette in Milwaukee on Fri-
day. V
It will be the teams’ only regular-
season meeting of the year.

Last Thursday, team doctors cleared
Fields, who has missed No. 22 Pitt’s
last 12 games withva broken fifth meta-
tarsal in his left foot, to play.

He participated in a team walk-

through before Pitt’s 55-54 win against
West Virginia the same day he was
cleared and did individual workouts
over the weekend. ,
A Pitt coach Jamie Dixon said that
since the doctors cleared Fields, it’s
been up to the 5-foor-l0 junior to de-
cide when he is ready to go.

Perennial power UConn 
visits the Pete on Sunday

by Zack Chakan
Staff Writer

Pitt women’s basketball faces a tall task
Sunday when it squares off against peren-
nial powerhouse Connecticut at 2 p.m. in
the Petersen Events Center. The game will
be televised on ESPNU.

The Panthers have lost three out of
their past four contests, and things won’t
get any easier against the No. 2 Huskies.

No. 18 Pitt (18—6, 8-3 Big East) is
caught in its toughest stretch of the sea-
son, facing ﬁve ranked teams in seven
games. The club needs to rebound after
getting smacked at West Virginia, 56-35,
on Wednesday night.

That perfonnance was undoubtedly the
worst of the year for the Panthers, par-
ticularly on offense. Pitt shot 20 percent
from the _ﬁeld and made four baskets in 18
attempts in the ﬁrst half, scoring only 13
points.

. “You can’t just say we were having an
off night,” said Pitt coach Agnus Berenato
after the game. “We were missing inside,

 

outside, wide-open shots. We were miss-
ing everything.” J

-Uncharacteristically sloppy play
doomed the Panthers as well. The team
committed 20 turnovers and only had
three assists.

Both trends will have to be erased in
order to knock off a prestigious Connectii,

cut squad.

There's no

by Andrew Chikes:
Senior Staﬂ W/riter

 

The Drake Bulldogs know that you
aren’t paying attention to them.

Like a church mouse, the little team
from the little conference quietly has crept
all the _way up to No. 15 in the national
rankings. And despite their loss to South-
ern Illinois Wednesday night, you can be
sure the Bulldogs will hang around the top
25 for a while.

1 This team simply knows how to play.

Heading into this week, forward Jona-
thon Cox and guard Josh Young were Nos.
1 and 2 in 3-point shooting in the Missouri
Valley Conference, the nation’s most re-
cent source of several. NCAA Tournament
Cinderellas. Cox is connecting at a clip of
49.2 percent, while Young boasts a hearty
46.8 percent from behind the line. 2

During their 2l—game winning streak
prior to Wednesday, the Bulldogs were
also out—rebounding opponents 34.5 to
30.6, despite their tallest roster standing at
an unimposing 6—foot—8.

Drake understands why you still aren’t
paying attention to them.

“Ithink every time we win a game this
year, we’re setting some kind of record or
it’s the ﬁrst time for something,” Drake’s
ﬁrst—year head coach Keno Davis told the
Des Moines Register.

There are several reasons for that.

The Bulldogs have never ﬁnished in
the top 100 of the RPI standings in school
history. ‘ _

That will change. .

Currently, Drake is sitting at 10th in the
RPI, comfortably sandwiched between
perennial power Connecticut and Atlantic
10—1eading Xavier. '

Drake’s pathetic historical record
earned it a ninth—place positionlin the pre-
season Missouri ‘Valley Conference stand-
ingsthis year.

Last season’s 17-15 ﬁnish was the only
winning season the Bulldogs enjoyed
since the 1986-87 campaign.

That will also change. 

The program is long removed‘ from the
glory days of its Final Four run in 1969.
In fact, Drake has never won a Missouri
Valley Conference tournament since the
conference’s inception in 1977.

The Bulldogs have an 11-29 all-time
record in the MVC tournament and have
never won more than two games in a sin-
gle tournament. That, too, will change.

bullying
these Dake Bulldogs

Like Vermont and Bucknell of the past
decade, the Bulldogs have experienced a
meteoric rise through the college rankings
without much explanation or fanfare. Per-
haps like these. teams, Drake will also etch

itself in the history books with a huge win .

against a highly ranked, big-conference
program in the NCAA Tournament. The
Bulldogs are almost there —. they beat
power conference programs Iowa and
Iowa State earlier this season. 1

It isn’t so far—fetched at this point.

_ The "Missouri Valley Conference has
produced several ‘very strong tournament
‘teams over the past few years. In fact,
many analysts consider the MVC to be
up with the ACC and Big East in terms of
talent and competitive balance within the
conference.

Last season, conference regular season
champion Southern Illinois advanced all
the way to the Sweet 16 after earning a
No. 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament, l'os—
ing a heartbreaking 61-58 decision to top-
seeded Kansas. -

The Salukis have made six straight
NCAA Tournament appearances dating
back to 2002.

In 2006, Patrick O’Bryant led Missouri
Valley’s Bradley to wins over Kansas and
Pitt on their way to the Sweet 16.

The Bulldogs’ only two losses this sea-
son have both come at the hands of capa-
ble teams — No. 25 St. Mary’s and South-
ern Illinois, a team that was ranked as high
as No. 24 before the season began.

Yes, this team will live and die by the
3—pointer. Yes, they are undersized. Yes,
they are young and inexperienced on the
big stage. But throw all of that out the
window. I 3

Anyone following this team realizes
that something special is happening, and
reason and logic have little to do with it.

Credit Davis, a likely national—coach-
of-the—year candidate, with getting the
most out of the talent that was assembled

for him. Davis runs the ﬂex offense, which

is one of the most widely used offenses in
basketball.

Credit his father and legendary Iowa
coach, Tom Davis, for assembling that tal-
ent for him. Davis coached Drake for four
seasons before handing over the reins to
his son. '

And credit the players for believing in
themselves when it seems no one else in
the country did. Drakeknows you aren’t
paying attention to them.

That will also change very soon.

Must~Win game on docket

for Panthers, Golden Eagles

Men's hoops, page 15

‘T11 be ready to play no matter how
many minutes I get,” said Fields. _

. Dixon added, “There aren’t any rules
in this.  It’s always up to him.”

The game, which tips off at 9 p.m.
at the Bradley Center and will be na-
tionally televised on ESPN, will be the
first time the Panthers (19-5, 7-4 Big
East) and the Golden Eagles (l7—6, 7-5
Big East) clash since their quarterfinals
matchup in last year’s Big East tourna-
ment.

The Panthers won that game, 89-79,
but have lost each of their past three
games at Marquette.

Both squads are coming off con-
vincing conference wins and sit next to
each other in the conference standings.

This is a must-win game for both
teams, with conference play winding
down. ‘

Pitt comes into the game having won
two straight, its first winning streak in
the past seven games.

The Panthers were 8-4 without
Fields, who injured his foot during

 

February 15, 2008

Pitt’s 80-55 loss at Dayton on Dec. 29.

In order to get the win, the Panthers
will continue to rely on production
from their young players.

With so many injuries, Dixon has
been forced to use four freshmen in his
eight-man rotation.

The stellar play of DeJuan Blair
needs no recognition, but Dixon said
Brad Wanamaker and Gary McGhee
have improved week to week and are

‘adapting to the up-and—down season.

When asked about Fields, however,
Dixon was not as open as his ﬂoor gen-
eral.

“It’s all speculation until he actually
plays,” said Dixon.

“I don’t want to focus on the guys
we don’t have, I’d rather focus on the
guys we do have.”

Those players, like Ronald Ramon
and Keith Benjamin, have all devel-
oped in the absence of Fields, and the
extra experience will help the team as
it makes its post—season push.

“With [Fields’] absence, it brought

swingman Gilbert Brown.

in “The things we’ve learned will
make us better.”

_When asked how he thought
Fields ' would reincorporate him—‘
self into the lineup, Brown said,

_‘‘He.. #9115 right b%1¢.k.iI1 the thi.<.=1< .
of things.”

The Panthers will need Fields’
ﬂoor leadership to keep Mar-
quette’s guards in check.

The Golden Eagles showcase
a backcourt that features the
speedy Dominic James.

James is one of college bas-
ketball’s best at penetrating and
driving the lane. _

The junior guard is known as
a great passer with an ability to
see the floor and change speeds
easily.

Marquette returns all of its five
starters from last year’s team.

With Pitt’s injuries, the Pan-
thers will be fielding a starting

lineup that returns no one from
the teams’ last game.

Still, much focus will be on
Fields.

Fields, who averaged 11.8
points, 5.4 assists and four re-
bounds a game before his injury,
believes the Panthers still havegna

shot to win the Big East regular-

season crown.

Fields admitted that he needs
to play himself back into game
shape and will be wary about his
foot fracture.

Those factors won’t discour-
age him, though.

“There’s no sense in playing
if I’m not totally confident,” said

A Fields.

There’s no telling how effec-

V tive Fields will be in his return,

but his enthusiasm is evident.

“I’m real energetic. I have P

a lot of emotions going,” said
Fields. “I’l1 be real excited to be
in uniform.”

Walker will handle the job of contain-
ing Charles but must do so with a both-
ersome ankle injury that she suffered in

. a loss to Rutgers two weeks ago. West
Virginia coach Mike Carey said after his“-

team’s victory over Pitt that he has seen
Walker move a lot better than she did on
Wednesday.

Pitt’s stars look to bounce back from
substandard performances against the
Mountaineers. Zellous, Pitt’s scoring lead-

only six points. Walker made two free
throws to account for her total.
