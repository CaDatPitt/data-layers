"Engineers
Will Hear
Dean’s Talk

Assembly Ends
Triad of Events
In Busy Week

Tomorrow’s address by Dean
E. Allen Holbrook to a general
assembly of engineering and
mining stud'ents and faculty will
put the ﬁnishing touches to a

week of activit'y in the School
of Engineering. Following tonight’s
srnjbker in Trees gym, beginning at
8:30 o’clock, the assembly wi1l-con-
clude a triad of events begun on
last Thursday.

A quartet and a swing band of
engineers will make up the enter-
tainment tonight. Admission to
outsiders will be 25 cents per per-
son- The smoker is under the
chairmanship of Bill Smith, E41.
Holbrook to Speak 4

During fourth hour tomorrow,
Dean Holbrook will address all en-
gineering and mines students and
faculty at compulsory assembly in
Soldiers’ and ‘ Sailors’ ‘memorial
hall. Over 900 students are expect-
ed to hear Dean Hol.brook’s address
on “The Engineering Student and
National Defense.” All classes and
seminars have been suspended for
this address.

Taking an active part in the cur-
rent government defenese program,
the School of Engineering on Mon-
day initiated a defense training
program to run twelve to twenty-
four weeks. Registration ran from
last Thursday through last Satur-
day. V

A tabulation of the number of
students enrolled showed 420 in de-
scriptive geometry and mechanical
drawing, 133 in mechanical design,
161 in metallurgical inspection, and
180 in production engineering. The
courses will be completed about
July 1.

Non-credit Course

Directing this program is Joseph
S. Lambie, consulting civil engi-
neer of Pittsburgh and former pro-
fessor of civil engineering at the
University. Similar courses have
been inaugurated at Carnegie Tech
and Penn State in this district.

The defense program offered by
many colleges and universities
throughout the country is being

made available through government
funds. At Pitt no academic credit
will be given fo-r the completion of
the. course.

Sale of Junior Prom

Reservations Continues

All those who wish to sway to
the swing-sweet synco'oat‘ons of Jan
Savitt and his Top Hatters at the
“Esquire Ball,” the 1942 Junior
prom, may now purchase $1 reser-
vations in the office of the dean of
men, according to Ralph Kallock,
C, chairman.

If the “good time that was had
by all” at Monday’s preview tea
dance is any indication of the suc-
cess of the prom, the committee
feels that it may look forward to a
gala night at the William Penn
hotel on January 17.

Rumania Gives
Choice of 
To University

Chancellor’s Request
Granted by Premier

Answering an ofﬁcial request‘
from Chancellor John G. Bow-
man, Ion Antonescu, premier of
Rumania, has given the Univer-
sity a free rein in the selection of
the exhibits which were featured
in the Rumanian building at the
New York World’s fair for use in
the Rumanian nationality room.

. As a result of -this gift, exhibits
in the World’s fair, which attracted
thousands of visitors to the Ruman-
ian building this summer. will be
made a part of the University, said
Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, ad-
viser to the nationality room proj-
ect, as she revealed some of the
gifts already selected.

Byzantine Theme Employed

Among the costly materials al-
ready taken for the room by Mrs.
Mitchell and Albert Klimcheck,
University architect, are Ruman-
ian marble and alabaster, several
pieces of unique hand—carved fur-
niture, embroidered blue draperies,
and an iron grill-work gateway.

The central theme used in the
construction of the room is to be
that of an early Byzantine church.
located in Bucharest. Commissioned
architect for the room is Ghica
Budesti, noted Rumanian architect.

Much of the material already has
been shipped here from New York,
the lighter gifts being kept in the
Cathedral, while the huge slabs
of marble are being stored in the
Stadium until work on the room be-
gins.

Greek Room Nears Completion

Construction of the room will not
begin, Mrs. Mitchell predicts, un-
til spring and, according to the
schedule of the nationality room
project, should be completed some
time next autumn.

The room will be opened for use
soon after completion.

Meanwhile the Greek room, new-
est in the nationality series, is
reaching the ﬁnal stage in its con-
struction,  the committee is ne-
gotiating with a noted Greek paint-
er to decorate the room. The paint-
ing should start either late this
month or early in February, with
the dedication ceremonies coming in
late spring.

The work of the painter consists
in decorating the carved marble
ceiling in the room.

Recreational

Series With Address on Jobs

Outlining ﬁve qualiﬁcations for
recreational leaders, Dr. Elizabeth

Rearick, professor of physical edu-
cation, on Monday opened Recrea-
tional Guidance week, sponsored
by WSGA Employment council.

The series of meetings on this
type of employment will continue
with two discussions tomorrow.
The round table conference which
will be led by T. R. Alexander, ex-

ecutive secretary of the YMCA and

director of Camp Laurel Ridge,
scheduled for this afternoon, has
been postponed until tomorrow at
3:30 o’clock in 208 Cathedral.

Bert Gold, ﬁeld instructor in
group work in the School of Applied
Social Sciences, will speak at an-
other meeting, a round table on
camps for juniors (ages four to
twelve) at the same hour in 202
Cathedral.

The ﬁve qualiﬁcations for recre-
ational leaders which Dr. Rearick
stressed were: 1) love of outdoors,
including all weather; 2) good
health, abundant energy, and cour-
age; 3) understanding of 13901016,
ability to get along with others.
and interest in people; 4) under-
standing of physical needs of chil-
dren; and 5) skill in camp activ-
ities.

Color movies of Camp Pitt were
shown by C. W. Morgan, instructor
in physical education who also an-
nounced University credits in be-
ginning and advanced courses of
recreational leadership, supervision
of recreation, camping and recrea-
tion skills, and camp counselor
training will be given for summer
work at the camp.

Nathan Kaufman, recreation su-
pervisor of Allegheny county,
spoke at yesterday’s meeting.

Shaw Resigns Position

In Military Honorary

Robert M. Shaw, Ed41, wielded
the gavel as president of Scabbard
and Blade for the last time yester-
day when he handed in his resig-
nation as captain of D company,
seventh regiment of Scabbard and
Blade, honorary military science
fraternity.

Shaw stated that his duties as
president of YMCA together with
a heavy class schedule forced his
resignation.

David T. Buente, C41, vice presi-
dent, succeeded to the presidency.

Architect’s Drawing of Proposed Cyclotron Building

Construction of New Building,
“Atom-Smasher to Take Year 

Through a gift of $50,000 to the School of Medicine from  "

Alan M. Scaife, the University will begin construction of a cyclo-
tron and a building to house the instrumenton campus.
Dr. Alexander J. Allen, associate professor of physics, who

constructed the cyclotron for the Biochemical-Foundation of the
Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, will be in charge of the con-'

struction of the University’s atom—smasher.

Authorities expect

that it‘ will be about a year before the building and the cyclotron

reach compl.etion.

The building, to measure 40 by 70 feet, will be located near
the Medical center, on O’I-Iara street, so as to be suitable for the

treatment of patients there.

Seventy tons of iron and 30,000

pounds of copper will be used to construct the huge electromag-

net, heart of the instrument.

Invention of 225-Ton Cyclotron Enables Scientist

To Smash Atoms, Receive Nobel. Prize for 1939

In 1929, a young scientist dared
to dream—0f smashing the atom.

In the 10 years following, he did
something about that dream.

And in 1939 he was awarded the
Nobel prize for the outstanding
scientiﬁc achievement of the year.

That man was Dr. Ernest Orlando
Lawrence, who at 38 years of age
was a veritable youngster in the
ﬁeld of scientiﬁc research.

I-Iis “brain-child” was a 225-ton
piece of machinery known as the
cyclotron, which may, some day,
prove to be- one of the most vital
steps forward in man’s conquest of
his environment.

doubting world the results of his

Reports Slated
For SFA Meet

Committee reports will make up
the bulk of the business at the Jan-
uary meeting of the Student-Facul-
tv association tonight on the twelfth
ﬂoor.

Hiram Milton, C42, chairman of
the committee on studer.-t transpor-
tation, will report to the meeting on
the possibility of getting reduced
student street car passes. He also
will report on his contacts of the
other colleges in the city on the
transportation setup.

A report on the future of the
Men’s tuck shop will be given by
Hillard Kreimer, BA42. Edward
Tait, C-12, will speak on the success
of the Esseiay theater and will
suggest added improvements for the
future.

Also at the meeting the appoint-
Carrier,

co-chairmen of the senior memorial
committee, will be announced.

It was revealed Monday by the
executive committee that Freda

of the Scholar’s day committee to
succeed Irving Kaufman, C41, who
had resigned.

Petitions for the chairmanship
of the senior announcements com-

Chancellor
Starts 25st
Yem*° at Pitt

By Fred Lange

The 42-story Cathedral of Learn-
ing was called an accomplishment
of Dr. John Gabbert Bowman-—
yet his principal purpose in build-
ing it was not to construct just an-
other high class school house.

Twenty years chancellor of the
University this week, Dr. Bowman
revealed, “The primary aim is not
to construct bu3'ldings——that is to
get out of the rain.”

What he is striving to do, ex-
plained the chancellor, is to “get a
vibration through the student body”
as to what the race is, what it has
been and where they (students)
will take it.

Chancellor Bowman, who has
been an education executive since
1905 when he was secretary of the
Carnegie foundation, noting an im-
proved change in the student body,
asserted:

“I do not know of any other Uni-
versity in which there is a more
mature and patient outlook in the
student body (than at Pitt).

“Students cannot be organized
into a mob by somebody’s propa-
ganda. They will think things out
for themselves.”

“If the University is completed,
it will be dead,” alfirmed the Chan-
cellor, during an interview on his
impression of the University after
20 years at the helm.

He explained that a University

Br. Jones Corners Fiction Market with Stories

I n Redbook, Liberty,

By Sidney Grossman

A story in the current Redbook,
one accepted by Liberty, and another
accepted by Country Gentleman is
an enviable record for any writer.

Dr. Putnam F. Jones, associate
professor of English, conﬁrmed
Monday that he had received notiﬁ-
cation that the three big-time
“slicks” had purchased his manu-
scripts.

The story in Redbook is titled
“That Ye Be Not Judged,” the one
in Liberty, “The Philosopher’s Cat,”
and in Country Gentleman, “The
Blue Canary.”

In the past four years Dr. Jones
has had stories accepted by Cosmo-
politan, Elk’s Magazine, Canadian
Home Journal, Columbia, and Ex-
tension.

“The subjects of my stories have
ranged from baseball to the inva-

Jones said. “The emphasis is on
people. Magazine readers want to
read about people.”

“Writing for publications ena-
bles me to see further into the
technique and to appreciate more
fully the skill of people who do so
much better than I do,” Dr. Jones
stated.

“I write most of my stories dur-
ing summer vacations and holi-
days,” added Dr. Jones. He ﬁnds
morning or night the best times for
writing. At the present time he
has eight or ten stories making the
rounds of magazine editors.

Offering no formula for success
in professional writing, he says
that continued writing is the only
way.

ter; (2) parallel voltage tubes; (3)
a giant magnet; and (4) an acceler-
ation chamber where atomic bul-
lets are alternately kicked by the
voltage and pulled by the magnet
until they rea.ch an incredible
speed.

When these bullets are “ﬁred”
out of the chamber, they smash the
atom.

In addition to its atom-smashing
power, the cyclotron has created
the neutron ray—of intense pene-
trating power because the neutron
particles have no electric charge.

Experiments show that under cer-
tain conditions this ray has four
times the lethal effect of the X-ray
on active cancer cells, and is less
harmful to health tissue.

Summer Civil
Servants Earn

Standard Pay

Salaries of students employed on
the new part-time civil service em-
ployment program will be based on
an annual payrate of $1,440, the
local office of the United States
Civil Service commission advised
Wednesday.

These jobs, as announced in Mon-
day’s News, will be offered to col-
lege students during vacation pe-
riods. Students, to qualify, must
pass “student aid” examinations.

Application blanks will be avail-
able only at the local office of the
commission in the Federal building
or from civil service oﬂices in
Washington. Blanks will not be
sent out to colleges, the local office
advised.

Students who receive positions
will probably work in Vvashington,
according to the Pittsburgh office,
but there may be a few local jobs
available.

Duties of the positions are to

tasks” connected with the applica-
tion of the principle of one of the
sciences in the icllowing optional
branches: agricultural economics;
agrono-my; animal husbandry; biol-
ogy (wildlife); engineering; forest-
ry; geology; home economics; hor-
ticulture; political science, history,
or sociology; range management;
soils; and statistics.

In order to qualify for a position
a student must have formally in-
dicated at his college or univer-
sity his intention of majoring in
one of the above subjects. Junior
students will be admitted to the
examinations, subject to furnishing
proof of the successful completion
of their junior college year prior
to July 1, 1911. Applicants must
have completed the third year of
college after May, 1938, in order to
be eligible.

Closing date for applications is

This wider scope of application
was the wish of Mrs. Scaife in pro-
viding the cyclotron, so that it
might be available for those en,-
gaged in pure science and indus-:
trial research in this district.
Idea of Donor

Mrs. Scaife told Pitt News report-
ers Monday that she hoped the cy-
clotron would “provide beneﬁts not
only to those engaged in medical
research, but would help in the
alleviation of suffering, by being
used for the treatment of patients.
The cyclotron is the most recent in-
strument developed in the field of
science, and after hearing of its
successful application. elewheife, we
decided that Pitt should have one.
After all. we must keep up with
the. times.”

University heads were err-thusi-,
astic in their prediction:-: of the re-'
sults of the cyclotron.

Cha.ncel.lor’s Comment

Chancellor John  13c-\.vrn2xn said,
“Mrs. Scaife, by her gift of the
c:y—cl.otron, has done more toward
the betterment of scientiﬁc research

1

and. toward the en-couragement of
scientiﬁc research at the Univer-
sity and in Pittsburgh t.l'1an she
realizes.”

Dr. William S. M<.:Ellroy. dean of
the School of Medicine, described
the instrument as being of “im-
measurable value in the stimulation.
of research, not only  the ﬁeld of
medicine, but in other scientific and
industrial. research in this area.” _

Collaborating the statement of
Dr. McEllroy, Dr. Elmer P. Hutch-
isson, professor and head of the de-
partment of physics, said, “The cyc-
lotron will be a wonderful stimu-

lation to the development of sci- ,

ence and scientiﬁc research in Pitts-  ~

Negro Quartet
Sings in Foster

As its part in the fourteenth an-
nual Stephen Foster memorial serv-
ices Monday, the SFA concert com-
mittee will present the Foster hall
quartet, negro vocal group of In-
dianapolis. The quartet will sing
at 12:50 o’clock, Monday, in Foster
memorial. In the evening the
group will take part in the memo-_
rial program sponsored by the Uni-
versity.

The quartet was organized in
1932 by Josiah K. Lilly, one of the
founders of the memorial, for the
purpose of singing Foster songs.
From 1932 to 1936 the quartet sang
under the auspices of Foster ball
as the Foster hall quartet. ‘

Since 1936, when the Foster hall
collection was moved to Pittsburgh,
the group has had no official con-
nection with Foster hall. 9

In addition to specializing in Fos-
ter songs, the quartet siiigs spiri-
tuals and other negro music. The
personnel of the quartet includes:
first tenor, George M. Robinson J11;
second tenor, Wallace M. Wooltolk;
baritone, Edward W. Hammond;
and bass, Clarence E. Hicks.

Following its appearance here,
the quartet will return to the mid-
west.

Musicians

from the Pitt band, the Univer-
Si1i.V symphony, and the University
Glee club will dance Friday, Janu-
ary 31, at the annual Musicians
ball which will be held at the

The Cyclotron:
A Weapon For Good

.. THE GIFT OF MONEY with which to build
a cyclotron for the aid of scientiﬁc investigation
is the most satisfying news of the new year.

In a world rapidly being brought to its knees
by the stupid misapplication or perhaps the cal-
culated exploitation of science, the news of the
projected machine which can conceivably help
make men live better and longer compensates
a little for the disaster now visited on men for
their mistakes.

I If there is any hope alive in a world shat-
tered by the mismanagement of machines and

men alike, science is that hope. Science has long
been the slave of interests inimical to the wel-
fare of the whole people. Some say that the
hope of the world lies in the belief that scientists
will speak out; and in their understanding of
man and his environment and in their power to
make machines work miracles they will turn
the tide away from barbarism.

Let us hope it is not too late; let us hope that
this brave new project will not be sidetracked
by men planning destruction.

Professors Proiess
AE'Ei_i;'II.d-I! on bWa:r

WE ARE PROUD to learn that ﬁve Univer-
;sity professors have come out for a deﬁnite pol-
icy toward the war. ’

'. Our pride is not diniinished by the fact that
when they joined the Committee to Defend
America by Aiding the Allies, they pledged
themselves to a course of action which in our
opinion will lead straight towards military ac-
tion against Germany.

(One of the founders and chairman of the
committee since its inception, William Allen
White, resigned from the chairmanship shortly
after stating that he opposed American con-
voys for British shipping and the repeal of the
Johnson Act (no credits to debtors). He also
adopted the slogan “The Yanks Are Not Com-
in:g.” .In a letter Wliite wrote, “In two of our
chapters-—Ncw York and Washington——w‘e have
a bunch of warmongers and under our organiza-
tion we have no way to oust them and I just’
can’t remain at the head of an organiza,tio‘1t that
is being used by thosejchapters to dance‘ for
war.”) ‘

Still ﬁve out of a possible 500 professors in the
University is not a great total when one stops
to consider how long the committee has operated
andlfow much publicity it has managed to give
itse .

Up until. now much too little has been heard’
from those on campus who have an understand‘-
ing of world affairs. Let’s have more of it.

We all favor war. But you, thou

done before. Empire is much more
exciting than revolution, and popu-
lar, too! Study our friend Churchill.

Del: Then, Americanus, you hold
that this war like the last one is
futile; that the Gestapo is a fake;
that America will be preserved as
well without it.

Amer: I say that this war is not
futile; that the Gestapo is not a
fake; that if only America alone
needs preservation, war is no asset.
But that is not all. -America alone
is not a concept. For America to-
day is not soil and people, as the
revolutionists want it to be. Per-
haps it would be better that way,
but we are not oﬁ‘_'ering a choice.
America is control over steel and
oil and power and empire-—-and that
way is more dangerous but just as
exciting. A positive war for Coca-
Cola Export and A General Electric
International is better than a deni-
oeratic war for RFC and PWA.
Dollars and sense diplomacy is
healthier for democracy than the

“How about some more of that Mexican stuff?”

I turned to my sidekick, Karl Eagle.
“Shall I tell ’em how we happened to come to Pitt?”
I asked him. He nodded, and here it is.

We were smuggling guns to a bandido with revolu-
tionary ideas down on the border, and another bandido
with anti-revolutionary ideas as regards other folk was
hot on our trail. One day this latter lad jumped us.

Senor Eagle and I were riding peacefully along
when a riﬂe cracked and my hat jumped from my head.
We pulled our horses down and dug in behind them.
Karl probed my wound and said, “Boy, throw away
‘your comb. You’ve got a permanent part.”

Eight Mexicans jumped out of the brush and charged
us. “Let me take the blue-eyed ones,” I said, “I can
see their eyes bulge better when a slug" smacks right

idea struck me.

A man leaped over the horses at me. Karl’s pistol
cracked and the man plopped beside me with a thud.
I yelled at Karl,
“Whatta ya mean, one,’ he shouted back, over the roar
of riﬂes, “Two! I got two with one shot! Look on top

“Another one dead,”

of that guy!”

I did. There was another Mex there with a bullet

Suddenly, almost as soon as it had started, the battle
ceased. Heaps of dead laybefore our improvised fort.
Karl had fourteen

“I’ve only got thirteen in my heap.
We’Ve gotta do something about that.”

One-Way Bias

Step into my parlor, said the spider to the ﬂy,

You look so damned contented as you watch the world
so by,

You haven’t any troubles, and I’m really quite dis-
traught,

It’s been so very, very long since you and someone
fought.

New York would look so lovely after a hundred bombs
or so, :
And think of all the subways where you and yours
could go,

When the Empire State starts tumbling and the Con-
course is in ﬂames,

Then the children won’t annoy you with their silly,
noisy games.

The voyage to the continent is long but interesting,

Crusaders feel not pain nor joy when they are out
a-questing,

You’ve a lot of healthy youngsters, some of whom are
unemployed,

Most of them have never killed, and should be over-
joyed.

War’s an education, it’s amusing, it’s a sport,

You can murder other people and you won’t wind up
in court,

You keep company with cooties who are highly enter-
taining,

You can watch them race across your chest and swim
when it is raining.

So step into my parlor, but let’s ﬁnd some excuse,
Let’s tell the voters something before we tie the noose,
Let’s justify our actions, let us reason have and rime,
Oh, yes, Democracy—oh, no, we used that one last time.

But let’s notworry over that, let’s think of it over later,

There’s always something, don’t you know? to make
a man a hater,

Come“ on, get in, it’s lots of fun, we’re way ahead of
YOU,

But you’re so very clever you’ll lose dozens to our two.

In progression geometric, the death tolls quickly mount,
You’l1 soon be up to us and then the extra ones don’t
count,

So step into my parlor, we’ve a lot of work to do,

And you’re the one can do it, you clever people, you.

WE, THE 1

are convinced that the time to check the Nazi war machine is now, and
the place to check that war machine is on the British war front, democ-
racy’s first line of defense. If the Nazi advance should succeed, we
lose the possibility of a decent world order in our time. If on the other
hand the Nazi push is blocked, the ordering of the future will by no
means be easy. But the possibility of continually forming and reform-
ing the future through frank and free criticism will remain. A

OUR CREED involves standing unshakeably for democracy . .
way of governing built on persuasion and on frank, outspoken criti-
cism. It involves standing unshakeably against Fascism . . . that way of
governing built on force and the blocking out of all criticism. And it
involves staunch cooperation with those now ﬁghting to defend democ-
racy against the Fascist onslaught.

THESE AIMS WE STAND BY:

All possible cooperation with those who are ﬁghting axis aggression.
This calls for planes, ships, and guns for Britain; revision of restric-
tive statutes which hamper such cooperation; giving China whatever
economic or ﬁnancial help we can without impairing aid to Britain;
keeping open the life line between the United States and Great Britain.
There must be complete non-cooperation with the aggressor nations.
We oppose appeasement in all its forms.

threw him over a nearby precipice. “Nothin’ but

We heaved them over, then turned back. “Hey,”
I said, “There’s another one! There were fourteen in

Diamond Coach
To Take Look

At Batterymen

Once again Coach Ralph Mitter-
ling is planning a series of practice
sessions for his baseball squad prior
to the customary spring tuneups.
All prospective pitchers and catchers
are to report at Gate 3 of the Sta-
dium, Monday afternoon, Janu-
ary 13.

Taking a January view of the bat-
tery boys, it seems that Mitterling
won’t have too much to worry about
in that department. Twirler Edgar
Jones will be back-to add another
letter to his already large collection.
Jones was the outstanding pitcher
on last year’s squad until an in-
jury put him out of commission for
the major part of the season.

Andy Johnson was called upon

‘to assume most of the pitching du-

ties after Jones’ injury‘ and did quite
well with his southpaw offerings.
He will be back again this year to-
gether with four other varsity vet-

. erans. Billie Bonelli, Ed Haluska,

Joe Treolo, and Joe Pommerschein
together with Jack Chiurazzi, who
is moving up from last year’s fresh-
man squad, round out a prelimin-
ary pitching staff that looks prom-
ising.

Veteran Guy Guadagnino will
have quite a battle to keep his
catching job. Art Bariska, a soph-
omore newcomer, has made quite an
impression -on Mitterling during l.ast
fall.’s practice meetings. He hails
from Hazelwood and has had a good
bit of experience with various out-
ﬁts throughout the district. ,

The freshman squad as well as
the rest of the varsity squad will
probably get a call later on in the
season. Any new baseball prospect
can see Mitterling in Tree’s gym
about joining the squad.

Returning to th.e court wars after a lapse of two weeks fra-
t‘e1‘nity quintets will endeavor to contiiiﬁe tlielr red hot pace as six
top ﬂightbasketball games are scheduled for tomorrow evening.

Heading the parade of outstanding games will be the battle
between the undefeated Phi Kappa team and the veteran array

boasted by the Kappa Sigs.

Last year’s champions, Phi Kappa, started off their season like

a house on ﬁre as they swamped
both teams they played by 20 points.
Their fast breaking offense com-
bined with their smooth defense
make them the most feared team in
the IF circuit.

The only cause of worry in the
Phi Kap domain is that the long
vacation may have knocked the
edge off their slick passing and ac-
curate shooting. Captain Jack
Glenn, Joe Connell, Bob Tyberski,
Bill Lohmey-er, and Tom Murphy
will be the star studded lineup the
ch:-Jmps put on the ﬂoor.

Pi.Lam.s Face Lambda Chi

Kappa Sigma nosed out a strong
Phi Delt team in their opening
game and have shown enough to
guarantee trouble ahead for the ex-
champions. Crawford of the Kappa
Sigs has been high scorer for his
team. The game will start -at 7
o’clock at the Trees gym.

Another battle involving an un-
defeated team will be staged at 9
o’clock on the Trees gym floor
when the Cinderella boys from the
Pi Lam house tackle the up and
coming Lambda Chi Alphas.

The Pi Lams, thus far this season,
has been a miracle ball club of out-
standing freshmen hoopsters. In
the opening game they copped an

Another “wrong down” official
also helped to plague the Pittites.
The Panthers had a two point lead

‘ with 19 seconds to g;o against Mich-

igan when they were awarded what
the referee called a “technical” foul.
Since the team that shoots a tech-
nical foul retains possession of the
ball whether or not the shot is
good. Pitt elected to shoot instead
of continuing their safety ﬁrst
measure of taking the ball out of
bounds.

Just as a Panther man was about
to shoot the foul, however, the
referee changed his mind, deciding
that it was a personal foul after all.
Pitt tried the foul anyway, missed
it, and watched a Michigander pitch

', in a one-handed shot from outside

the foul circle to save the game.
That sent the battle into overtime
and the rest is misery.

Rivalry reaches its highest point
at 8 o’clock tomorrow night when
the undefeated teams of Phi Gam-
ma Delta and Delta Tau Delta meet
in an effort to boost their standings
in the IF race.

A good contest is virtually as-
sured when these two old rivals
meet, for even though one team
might be a bit weaker than the
other the spirit makes up the dif-
'.’erence.

The Delts beat a favored Theta
Chi team in their inaugural battle

their other contest and meet each
other with clean records.

exercise for both teams. The Phi
Eps and the SAE’s seem to be get-

Feature Forfeits

Opening games on Monday in
both Independent basketball and
fraternity badminton were ﬁlled
with forfeits and double forfeits.

In fraternity badminton Sigma
Chi, Kappa Sigma, the Phi Eps, and
double forfeited and
Lambda Chi forfeited to the Delts.
SAE beat the Phi Gams in three
straight sets, and the Sammies
beat the PiLams, 2-1. In the last
match PiKa upset the Phi Delts,
15-8,‘ 8-15, 15-1.

There was only one game played
in the Independent basketball cir-
cle as the Orchids defeated the
Sophs, 26-12.

The Orchids, including in their
line-up Bill Dutton and Ralph Fife
of football lame, won the game with
the greatest of ease.‘ After the
first three minutes, it was obvious
that the Orchids would not be
headed, and at half-time they had
a 16-6 lead.

At the beginning of the second
half the Orchids continued to out-
play the Sophs, and at the ﬁnal gun

Pitt Receives
/item-Sm.asher,

New Building

Continued from page one
was awarded the 1939 Nobel prize
in physics for its development and
for the many researches in physics
and medicine which it has made
possible. ,
While the cyclotron is in itself a
complicated instrument, the basic
principles involved in its operation

are relatively simple, according to
Dr. Allen.

Workings of Machine Explained

Between the poles of an electro-
magnet a vacuum chamber is
placed. The output of a large
shortwave radio transmitter is ap-
plied to this vacuum chamber in
such a way as to speed up the ions
in it as if they had been acted on
by millions of Volts.

These ions spiral around as they
acquire speed and ﬁnally are drawn
off in a beam at- the edge of the
poles of the magnet where they are
used to produce radioactive ma-
terials or to produce neutrons for

research and use in the treatment of

cancer.

A New Research Instrument

The cyclotron is a relatively new
instrument of research. Essential-
l.y it is an atom-smashing machine,
an instrument for synthesizing
from ordinary matter large quan-
titles of hitherto unknown radio-
active elements. The remarkable
properties of these new atoms and
the almost unlimited possibilities
they offer in the ﬁeld of medical
research alone indicate for the
cyclotron’ even greater potentialities
than the X-ray tube had when it
was first developed about 40 years
ago, University authorities said.

The applications to medicine at
*orcfeni' are of two kinds: one using
l.a1**'*e quantities of radioactive ma-
te.‘;‘i.als for therapeutic effect in the
ire-a'l;r.r.:ent of cli.sea.se, and the other
1.:s?‘:‘.'>‘ small ouantities which can,
in effecct. be “tagged” and used in
burly  tracers in the investigation
 many body processes.
limzrther ‘Uses of Device

The possibility of tracing these
new radioactive elements leads to
one of the most striking achieve-
rnents of modern science. This is
possible because science is now
able to d.eter~.t radiations from a sin-
gle radioactive atom.

The elements which the cyclotron
can produce have chemical proper-
ties like orclirary chemical ele-
merits. In addition," however, they
are radioactive. By their being
rendered radioactive it is possible
to trace their entire journey through
the digestive tract, and into the
vital body organs.

Committee to Aid Allies '
Organizes Pitt Chapter

5 Faculty Men
To Guide Plans
Of New Group

Full aid to Britain as Amer-
ica’s first line of defense is the
announced policy of the college
division of the Committee to De-
fend America by Aiding the
Allies which today began its or-
ganization of a chapter among the
students and faculty members of
the University.

Five University faculty members
were announced by the committee
as members of its council of ad-
visers-, which aids and guides the
work of the group. They are: Dr.
Charles S. Tippetts, dean of the
School of Business Administration;
E. Allen Holbrook, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines;
Dr. John W. Oliver, professor and
head of the department of history;
Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor of
economics; and Dr. Putnam F.
Jones, associate professor of Eng-
lish.

VVon’t Ask for Recognition

Pointing out that it was not an
official campus activity, committee
organizers declared that recogni-
tion. would n.ot be asked from the
administration. and that no meetings
would be held on campus. “This

wvill not make it necessary for the

University to give similar recogni-
tion to any other organizations ad-
vocating appeasement or some un-
American philosophies,” they de-
clared.

Working in conjunction with the
Pittsburgh chapter of the national
organization, the group at Pitt plans
to arouse an interest in foreign af-
fairs among students and to present
to them the views of those who
favor aid to Britain and her allies
as a means of stopping the march
of the totalitarian forces. From
time to time open meetings with
prominent speakers will be spon-
sored to present such discussions.

VVill Have Student Officers

The chapter will be headed by
student officers who are to be se-
lected and announced shortly. re-
veals Frederick C. McKee, chair-
man of the Pittsburgh committee.
Organization. work is under the di-
rection of William L. Klinkenstein,
(‘.42. a member of the downtown
chapter. who declares that about
100 students have already signed as
members of the Pitt group.

The program of the committee
calls for aid to Great Britain and
her allies as America’s ﬁrst line of

-defense: opposition to appeasement

in all its forms and opposition to
a dictated or negotiated peace be-
fore the aggressors are defeated; in-
creased American arms production
as the “arsenal of democracy”;
modification of statutes which ham-
per cooperation with the democra-
cies fighting for their existence; a
ﬁrm policy in the Paciﬁc to stem the
tide of Japanese aggression; con-
stant preservation and improve-
ment of American democracy; and,
as a future aim, the establishment
of a world order which will provide
the means for just, democratic, and

peaceful settlement of interna-
tional disputes.
Students and faculty members

‘interested in supporting this pro-
gram by joining the committee are
asked to send their names to the
college division at 505 Liberty ave-
nue.

Debating Squads
Outline Schedule

For Coming Term

Varsity and freshman debate
squads have outlined a busy sched-
ule for the second semester.

Members of the varsity team will
meet several outstanding college

, debaters as they swing into their

campaign in central Pennsylvania
on March 11, 12, and 13. Matches
have been arranged with a num-
ber of prominent teams in that sec-
tion.

Arriving at Penn State on March
14, the debaters will participate in
the legislative convention for varsity
debate teams.

The annual trip to the midwest
will be made between April 1 and
7. Highlighting this trip will be
the group’s attendance at the na-
tional. convention of Delta Sigma
Rho, national honorary debating so-
ciety, in Chicaago.

Freshman debaters will delve in-
to a round of debates with high
schools in Vvestern Pennsylvania
durng January and February. On
February 13 the team will meet the
Penn State frosh. On March 7 and
8 the freshmen will trek to State
College where they will attend the
legislative convention for fresh-
man debaters.

Dr. N. A. N. Cleven . . .

professor of history, will partici-
pate in a roundtable discussion to-
morrow evening at 5:30 o’clock in
the downtown YMCA at an in-
formal dinner. He will discuss
“Human Adventuring in Ancient
America.” '

Brains ?

If You’re Dumbbells
Don’t Blame the Stars

If you were born under an un-
lucky star, or if you’ve been wor-
rying about being born in a. bad
month, you can throw your trou-
bles away, according to research
by Dr. Omar C. Held, associate
professor of psychology and per-
sonnel assistant to the dean of the
College.

In a wide study of students in
the University of Pittsburgh, Dr.
Held has found that the month of
the year has nothing to do with
the intelligence of college students.

In making a comparison with
reports from other schools Dr.
Held concluded that those born
in September and June had a
slightly higher mean mental rate
than those born in the winter
months.

Newmans to Honor

Three Grid Stars

Ted Konetsky, D44, Frank Jor-
dano, Carnegie Tech, and Alan
Donelli, Duquesne, will be honored
at the Newman club’s annual In-
tercollegiate dance, announces
James Dimel, E42, chairman. These
players were chosen on the basis of
their scholastic records, their ac-
tivities, and their playing ability.

Dick Stabile and his orchestra
will supply the music for this dance
which will take place at Hotel
Schenley on Friday from 9 to 1
o’clock. The dance is informal and
assessment is $2-per couple.

Tickets for the dance can be pur-
chased from any of the committee
members or at the club office, 832
Cathedral.

Faculty Members Contribute
To Professional Publications

Apparently attempting to corner
the professional magazine and
learned publication market, Uni-
versity members recently had seven
articles published.

Alice L. Crist, associate professor
of nursing education, has an ar-
ticle, “The Purpose and Characters
of an Evaluation Program in a
School of Nursing,” in the Decem-
ber issue of the Missouri State
Nurses’ association bulletin.

“Process Cost Systems,” written
by C. L. Van Sickle, professor of
accounting, i or the Accounting for-
um last summer, is reprinted in
Accounting Digest. J. John Lawler,
assistant professor of law, has writ-
ten two articles——-“Remainders Con-
ditional on Survivor:hip”—-in the
Temple Law‘ Quarterly, and “Classi-
fication of Contingent Remainders”

 

in the California Law Review for
January. l\/Ir. Lawler an.d his wife,
Gail Gates Lawler, are co-authors
of a book, “Short Introductory to
Law of Real Prosperity,” published
recently.

Other professors who have Writ-
ten articles for publication include
Bishop Brown, director of the Uni-
versity’s Research Bureau for Re-
tail Training, who is the author of
“Listen to the Customer” in the De-
partment Store Economist maga-
zine. Dr. Lee M. Thurston, profes-
sor of education, contributes an ar-
ticle, “Secretaries Are School Inter-
preters” to the Education Magazine,
and Zoe A. Thralls, associate pro-
fessor of geography, has a series of
articles on Latin American coun-
tries in the children’s newspaper,
Current Events.

Not Guilty . . .

Psychologists Clear Students
Of Double Talk Charge in Text

Double talk, another feature of
the English language, probly can-
not be blamed as the invention of
any university student.

In fact, “The Gostak Distims the
Doshes” was written at the turn of
the present century and Lewis Car-
rol used innumerable examples of
Jerry Colonnaisma earlier in the
nineteenth century in his book
“Alice in Wonderland.”

This revelation came out recent-
ly when elementary psychology stu-
dents reached page 221 in their text
“Psychology,” written by three
Carnegie Tech professors, Schoen,
Schaeffer, and Gilmer.

On that page the students learned
that a gostak cannot be a dosh be-
cause that was the way it was writ-
ten in 1903 by a certain A. Ingra-

ham in his “Nine Uses of Langua-
ges.” Even then he admitted that
double talk had a use.

The present use of double talk
by students is an attempt to get at-
tention, members of the Univer-
sity’s psychology department de-
clare. It is similar to the former
shouting of Joe Penner’s “Ya wan-
na buy a duck.”

However, there is some deﬁnite
use for a form of this nuisance in
the “nonsense” words used in psy-
chological experiments. In these,
consonants are connected with
vowels to form such syllables, as
rel, dil, and tal. These, in turn, are
used to determine the, memoriza-
tion ability of the subject.

And, incidentally, the pyschology
department says, “These syllables
are corkle with us.”
