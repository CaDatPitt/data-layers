Markus Announces Changes Task Force Considers
  In Student Activities

by JIM nosnx

William Markus, Associate
Dean of Student Affairs and Di-
rector of Student Activities, re-
cently announced new personnel
changes in the area of student
activities.

Terry Milani, who received a
masters degree in business ad-
ministration at the Northern Illi-
nois University, will be the new
Student Union manager.

He will be concerned with the
operational aspects of the Union,
including the ticket operations,
the Union desk and recreation fa-
cilities, according to Markus.
He will also work with the Stu-
dent Government Task Force
for a new Student Union.

Once a professional baseball
player, Milani is “highly recom-
mended and extremely qualified,”
according to Marcus.’

Milani will replace‘ Thomas
Tackage, who is leaving Pitt to
further his education at the Uni-
versity of Brussels’ Medical
School - I

A Anne Ginevan, a doctoral can-

‘ gdidate with the University of
Pittsburgh in Education, will be
the new sorority advisor. The
wife of Pitt’s former Director of
Housing, David Ginevan, she
was Assistant Dean of Students
and Dean of Women at Pennsyl-
vania State University’s 'McKees-
port campus.

Ginevan was also a Head Resi-
dent at Pitt in 1964-66, and ac-
cording to Markus, she has a
“strong background in the stu-
dent affairs area.”

' G‘ine.v_an will assume duties
from vMarcia Haley, .who is
-“leaving to become a home-
maker.” -

Fraternity advisor since _1964,
Lou McLinden will take on new
responsibilities as advisor to
General ‘Studies’ School students
and Graduate School students. In

this .cap'acity, he will work with
the General Studies Student Cab-
inet and the newly formed Grad-
uate Student Professional Organi-
zation.

McLinden, according to Mar.-
kus, ‘-‘will also play; a "role. as an
ombudsman"on the. undergradu-
ate ~level."." His office hours will
be a “more._convenient” 1-9 pm.
in Room'15,8-‘of the..Cath I lra l .'

‘‘We’ve ‘never had anyone help-
-ing graduate and evening stu-
dents with their problems,” said
Markus, “and there is a definite
need for this. McLinden, we

f_eel,ycan meet that--need.”

Markus: Reveals Staff Changes

Replacing McLinden as fra-
ternity advisor is Daniel Mel-
ero, a 1970 graduateof Carnegie-
Mellon University. “Extremely
active in extracurricular activi-
ties on the undergraduate level,"
Melero worked for CMU as A5-
sistant Director of Annual Giv-
ing in the Development Office.

“Melero came highly recom-
mended from CMU,” accord-
ing to Markus.

The new A Publications Advisor,
R. Davie Tive, will replace Eleanor

Sweeping Reforms Cited

Phi Delts Institute Policy

by MIKE MILLER

Phi Delta Theta fraternity has
instituted ”sweeping reforms" in
policy at the 49th Biannual Con-
vention of the General Fraternity
of Phi Delta Theta. according to
Chuck Steeber, Pitt/Convention
delegate.

The changes concern proced-
. ures for voting on pledge bids
and final blackballs.

Previously. a unanimous vote
by secret ballot was needed to
confirm a pledge bid. Now each
house can form its own policy on
how this procedure will be
conducted.

“We’ve been trying to get this
 for twenty years,” Steeber said,”
‘i ' but there has been quite a bit of
stagnation. This was the first
year that students outnumbered
alumni.” '

In the final blackball session
before initiation a pledge need-
ed the vote of 75 percent of the
brothers in order to gain accept-

 

ance into the fraternity. Now

‘each house will be able to de-

termine its own policy on this
matter. '

Steeber: Seeks diversified
brotherhood

Steeber hailed these changes
as "the most r_adical thing since
the elimination of the member-
ship clause which restricted

Staff   ’

Walsh, who will now reside in
Manhattan, New York City. Tive
worked with Walsh in the past,
and, according to Markus, “He
has done a great job so far in
the publications area.”

“We’ll be hiring,” said Markus,
“a graduate student intern to
work with Mr. Tive in the area
of publications to work ‘on the
handbook and other internal
publications.

“We feel that the total scope of
the publications advisor is too
much for one person, but with
the added intern. it should be
made easier.” ‘

In the area of specialprograms.
a few changes are in store. Since
the departure of Dr. Konnilyn

Feig, director of special programs.

Dr. Alfred Moye Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs, announced that- the
office of special programs would
beabolished in its present status.

The Office of Student Affairs,
however, :“did not want the di-
mensionof special programs to be
lost,” according to Markus.

The responsibilities of that of-
fice, he announced, will be trans-
ferred to the Office of Student
Activities. Jack Brown, who work-
ed under Dr. Feig, will become
Director of Student Activities for
Special Programs. ‘

“We have ‘every expectation
that the special program will be
enhanced by this shift in respon-
sibility and certainly not detract-
ed,” said Markus.

"In general, l’m optimistic
about the staff changes and the
new kind of role this staff will
play. These people were accept-
ed very carefully with students
making recommendations too.”

“The calibre of these people,"
Markus added, “is high. Their
strength will help bring about a
smooth transition in changes con-

I cerning the Office of Student Ac-

tivities."

Changes

membership clause was elimin-
ated in the late fifties accord-
ing to Steeber.

He feels the changes will
bring about “a more diverse
brotherhood.”

Steeber initiated a proposal

to eliminate certain rituals of
house . meetings which con-
tained religious connotations

which were found to be offen-
sive to some members.
A committee was f'ormed to

study the problem.
explained that it takes two con-

secutive conventions to change»

ritual or the constitution. There-
fore. the changes cannot be en-
acted before 1976.

The Convention also elected
Dr. Millet Chairman of the Ohio
Public "School System as presi-
dent of the General Council. the
highest ruling body of Phi‘ Delta
Theta. He succeeds Judge Wade
Wetherford.. a circuit ‘court
judge from South Carolina.

New Student Union,

by LOIS ELDER

A student task force along with
the Office of Student Affairs
will‘ serve as the first step in
planning a new student union
facility.

Bill Markus, Associate Dean
of Student Affairs, and Dave
Bluey, a Student Government
representative who is heading
the task force, spoke recently of
their plans.

Bluey said, “The purpose of
the task force is to find possible
means of funding a new student
union building and planning it.
We plan to find out what facil-
ities students would like in a stu-
dent union, like bowling alleys,
and how much space large organi-
zations like the Pitt News and
the Commuter Association need
to function adequately.

“We would also like to find
means of funding a new build-
ing. My idea, which I’ll submit
to the first task force meeting
later this month, is to possibly
add .a Student Union fee like
the present Student Activities
Fee. The task force will look
into suggestions like this and
see if they’re feasible.“

The task force is made of a
student from each major organi-
zation on campus such as WPGH,
the Pitt News, Commuter Associ-

ation and the’ Black Action So- .

ciety. There will also be a rep-
resentative from the Office of
Student Affairs. -

_Markus, spokesman for Stu-
dent Union plans from the Office
of Student Affairs, said his
office would like to work joint-
ly with the task force. “We
want to work in a. framework
with the task force that includes
planning with students.

“With the present Student Gov-
ernment administration there has
been considerable interest in
the present Student Union fa-
cility with its lack of sufficient
space for programs and activities
and its inadequacy.

“Tom Bailey, president of the
Student Government, has told us
of his desire for the Student
Union to be a building for stu-
dent. University and community

LOOK TEMPT|NG?. According to Jeff Pasek, co-chairman of

use that would include groups
like alumni, faculty and the
Women’s Association.

“The idea of a new Student
Union was discussed at the

Student Affairs Advisory Com-
mittee meetings with the Chan-

    

Bluey: Heads Task Force

cellor. Dr. Alfred Moye, Dean
of Student.Affairs, expressed his
concern with the present facility’s
inadequacy. ‘ ’

“A Student Union isn’t a high
priority for the building scheme

of the administration. But perhaps, '

with the work of the task force
the administration can at least
shift its priorities and put the
Student Union high on its list.” ‘

Concern was expressed by Bluey
and Markus for a building that
would facilitate" commuters as
well as dorm students.

Bluey said, “The University
student body is roughly 50 per-
cent commuting students. .They
need a place to stay between

classes. There isn’t even a good .

cafeteria for them.”

Markus said, “There’s a criti-
cal need on campus for a place
t'or commuters while they’re away
from home. This need is in terms‘
of a place to spend leisure hours,
an area to stay when they brown-
bag their lunches, and study space.
Presently, nothing
exists for these things, and the
commuter population is’ increas-
ing. One of our major ways in
planning a better facility is to

have commuters express. their *

need as they see it.”t

the

Legal Awareness Committee, over fifty bikes were stolen on-campus
in, the month of June. To help safeguard bikes and other students’
valuables, the Legal Awareness Committee and the Campus police
will sponsor a program in September to have valuables. registered.
If any registered iterns are stolen, there will be less difficulty in

identifying the ‘ripped-off’ merchaindise.

But John doesn‘t knock only
England. There are other songs
on the album; one tells of John
Sinclair. who was busted in Mich-
igan for possession of two joints
and sentenced to ten years in
prison.

There’s one about Angela Da-
vis—“they gave you coffee/ they
gave you tea/ ‘they gave you
everything but equality.” *

The Attica Prison Massacre
is condemned: "Shoot the pris-
oners in the towers, Forty-three
poor widowed wives. . . . But
the prisoners did not kill "Rocke-
feller pulled the trigger." That
is what the people feel."

And if that weren't enough.

‘there's even a satire on New

York City. appropriately entitled
"New.York City.“ -It‘s obvious
from the song that John liked

New York and wants to stay

there. But he's not going to win
any friends." especially among
the Catholics; if he keeps quot-'
ing good old David Peel with
lines like-_ “the Pope smokes dope
every day.“ »That‘s a no-no.
John.’ ? ‘ -

Yoko gets her licks in too. with
a women’s lib song. "Sisters. 0
Sisters." and "Born in a Prison."
She‘s not quite as lyrical as her
husband. but she‘s getting there.
Her p7>etry. though. can match
his any day for pure acidity.

None of these songs, though,

. and

xtremistAIbum MaylDepori Lennon, Yoko '

is nearly equal to what was sup-
posed to be the title song of the
album, “Woman is the Nigger of
the World.” It has been released
as a single, but there are only
five radio stations in the country
playing it, because of the fear
of backlash.

For the song is all that its
title implies. The women's -Move-'
ment should take this for -their
theme song. for it encapsulates
all the "put downs and all the de-
meaning situations women go
through.

The second album of this two-
record set features John and Yoko

with the Mothers of Invention. 

live at the Fillmore.‘ The only
thing worthwhile is “Cold Turkey"
the Mothers‘ music.
rest is nonsense. and a waste of
good vinyl and 45, minutes of
time.

I hope John and Yoko can stay
in New York so Yoko can have
her daughter and they can all
be together. And I hope people

. bn’t take this album as an in-

sult, but as a wish to try to cor-
rect obvious‘ wrongs in our
society.

But most of all. I hope John
knows that what he’s doing is-
backed. by all of us who believe
in power to the people and the
rights of the first amendment.

Gulf-Javelin Cops 2nd Rss Missss M“"ish

The Connecticut Motor Sports Car Race over
the fourth of July weekend saw the Pitt Javelin run
into some further trouble. After a brilliant Satur-

day performance, the car failed to function prop-

erly on the 196th American birthday.

On Saturday, the Javelin. formerly owned by
this year’s Indianapolis 500 winner. Mark Donahue.
won the pole position for the race. Donahue‘s form-
er backup car failed to cooperate when the flag
waived the following day.

In a manner similar to the trouble A. J. Foyt

‘had in the Indy classic. the Javelin failed to start -

when race time had arrived. And. what started out

' as a pole position ended up as a start in the 45th

position.

Once started, however, the Javelin, passed a
car a minute in the 45 minute race. But, the Gulf-
Javelin had trouble passing the only other car ahead
of it. Bob Fryer admitted that he could have prob-
ably passed the last car were it not for the fact that
the Javelin encountered more difficulty. That is, the
car kept popping out of fourth gear.

"The leading car was quicker than mine." said
Fryer. "but I lost any chance I had when the car
kept popping out of first."

The second place finish enabled the Javelin to
pick up six more points on its quest for a return
appearance in the National Sports Car Champion-
ship in Atlanta, Ga., in the fall.

Currently, the Javelin is in second place in the
North Eastern United States Division. Last year,
the Camaro, then driven by Fryer, finished third in
that same sector and made the trip to Atlanta.

"We’re all pleased with the performance of the
car over the weekend,” Fryer finalized.

Well he should be for despite the trouble. the
Gulf-Javelin came within one second of eclipsing
Mark Donahue‘s Limerock Raceway track lap rec-
ord.

Overall. it was a good fourth weekend for Fry-
er and the Javelin. even .hopgh the car missed out
on another fourth. fourth gear.

Pitt's Olympic hopeful. Billy Rea, saw his dream evaporate last
weekend in Eugene, Oregon, as he failed- to qualify for the Olympic
games in Munich, later this summer. ‘

, Rea, who finished seventh best in the finals qualifying round,
bounced back to a 26’2” jump in the finals but was edged out by two
inches. Rea’s jump in the quarterfinals was 25’7”.

While Rea.didn’t make .the team, he ended with the fourth best
leap and will serve as alternate in case one of the three qualifyers is
either injured or can’t attend for some other reason.
