Pitt, CMU receive grant for supercomputer center

By Michele Kiraly
Staff Writer

The National Science Foundation an-
nounced last Friday a grant of nearly
$40 million was given to the Mellon-
Pitt-Carnegie Corporation, a partner-
ship of Carnegie-Mellon University
and the University of Pittsburgh, to
establish a national supercomputing
center in Pittsburgh.

The national community and local
researchers will both beneﬁt from the
center. With the purchase of a $22
million Cray X-MP/48 supercomputer
and other related equipment, the Pitts-

burgh facility will be the most ad-
vanced of the ﬁve national supercom-
puting centers established by the NSF.
The total value of the project is over
$70 million.

“The accomplishment of our receiv-
ing the center has been one of the most
fantastic events that I’ve been involved
with,” CMU President Richard M.
Cyert said Friday. “This day, and the
fact that our office was awarded the
center does not seem completely real.”

The supercomputing center, known
as the Pittsburgh Center for Advanced

—Computing in Engineering and the

Sciences, will be operated by a consor-
tium of CMU, Pitt and the

Calendar changes spark

By Nancy Quick
-Staff Writer

Controversy over proposed new
changes in the University of Pitts-
burgh’s academic calendar was sparked
last Friday when a list of the proposed
changes was presented to the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences Committee for
review. .

The FASC expressed its concern that
“the committee on counter-change ap-
parently did not involve students and
faculty in its deliberation,” nor did it
advertise its considerations in such a
way that the FASC “can intelligently
support this change.”

“Such an important change should
be based on some empirical data, some
kind of survey. This seems so off-
hand," said Richard Gale, Professor
of Philosophy and member of FASC,

’ for theseproposals. 7’ -

 
 

fWe’re not given. any adequate support.

 

The Calendar Review Committee,
whose members represented faculty,
student and administrative groups, pro-
posed five basic changes in the
academic calendar:

0 the delayed opening, by one week,
of the winter term

0 the insertion of a one-week break
into the winter term

0 the reduction of reading periods to
weekends only (effectively eliminating
reading periods from the calendar)

0 rescheduling commencement to the
ﬁrst Sunday in May

0 the consolidation of all third-term
offerings into a single 10-week session
from mid-May to the end of July

Arnold Katz, professor of economics
and member of FASC, said that the
first three proposed changes shoitenthe

addition to the NSF grant, other
funding for the center will come from
consortium members, the state of Penn-
sylvania, the state’s Ben Franklin part-
nership, Cray Research, Inc. and other
industrial supporters.

Also, a $5.25 million appropriation
for the first three years of the center’s
operation (part of the state’s support for
Strategy 21, the regional economic
development plan) was already recom-
mended to the state legislature by
Governor Dick Thornburgh.

Protestors

By Leeli Davidson
For The Pitt News

Last Friday, nine organizations,

from Pittsburghers Against Apartheid,

to the NAACP, held a rally in the
William Pitt Union Ballroom and
demanded that the University of Pitts-
burgh divest itself of its holdings in
South Africa.

Three organizations —— Students for
a Free South Africa, the Black Action
Society and Pittsburghers Against
Apartheid -— sponsored the rally. Other
organizations connected with the rally
were the NAACP, the Chaplains
Association, the Department of Black
Studies, 453 faculty members against
apartheid, the Black Greek Council and
the campus athletes.

The gathering, which was in honor
of Martin Luther King J r.. was the first
time all those groups have formally
united on the divestment issue.

The speakers at the rally impressed
upon their audience that the anti-
apartheid movement on campus is
growing all the time. Donald Frazer,
public relations chairman for the Black
Action Society said: “It should be

' known that we, the Black Action Socie-

~ ty, do not stand alone on the issue of
divestment. We have a great percen-
tage of fraternities and sororities behind
us, as well as the SGB and the
athletes.”
Students for a Free South Africa, one

dispute

“This has been a very distinctive
feature of our program,” Katz said,
“that we end in mid- or late April.
These proposals take 10 days’ away
from the rather large break we have
had in the past for research.”

The 10_days missing from the end of
the term would be redistributed in
breaks and at other periods of time dur-
ing the term, should the proposed
calendar go into effect. According to
Katz, however, it is not a fair
exchange.

“A week in the middle of the term
is simply not as productive as a week
added on to that long period of time,”
he said.

Katz noted that the members of the
Calendar Review Committee

represented less than 25 percent of .

Pitt’s faculty. “If you include deans
among the faculty,” he said, ‘‘you’ll
see that the faculty [on the committee]

fessors of physics at Pitt and CMU,
respectively. “The supercomputing
center will provide the resources for
carrying out bold and imaginative pro-

jects that have never been attempted-

before,” Roskies said. “It will be a na-
tional center, to be used by the entire
national research community for
science and engineering.” R

Levine added that the center will fur-
ther enhance the region’s chances of
sustaining its technology-based
economic renaissance.

With Friday‘s announcement, Pitts-
burgh joins four university-based
supercomputing centers. The NSF
established the centers last year at Cor-

nell University, Princeton University,
the University of Illinois and the
University of California at San Diego.
The Pittsburgh facility will be the most
powerful of all ﬁve centers, according
to Roskies.

Last June, NSF ofﬁcials announced
they would transfer a Cray 1-S super-
computer from NASA’s Lewis
Research Center in Cleveland to the
Pittsburgh facilities. This was a
preliminary step in designating the
local schools as a supercomputing
center.

However, the Cray 1-S transfer was
not made whenlit was determined that

culating a divestment petition that has,
at last count, 2000 signatures. The Pitt
Hillel’s Rabbi Joseph Levine collected
453 faculty member sign_atures, and
Keith Tinsley, representing the campus
athletes, collected 103 athlete’s
signatures on an anti-apaitheid petition.

Speakers at the rally were Dennis
Brutus, incoming chairman of the black
studies department, Barbara Sizemore,
interim chairman of the black studies
department, Doanld Frazer of BAS and
Tony Baldwin, founding member of-

Students for a Free South Africa.
All of the speakers said they saw
divestment as a necessary moral and
political act. No excuse was acceptable,
Frazer said, Pitt's -continuous
moneylending to South Africa, when
the Pretorian government “already
spends $3 billion a year just to help
continue their apartheid practices.”
Tony Baldwin, a junior at Pitt,
asked: “How can we, my brothers and
sisters, stand here hourly and let the
university keep investments in South
Africa when blacks are forbidden to

-vote, 87 percent of the land is set aside

for the white minority, and, for blacks,
the infant mortality rate is 240 for every
1000 people. About 1 out of every 4
blacks die before they reach one year
old.” '

rally for divestment

Speakers at the rally disputed the

~ board of trustees’ claim that divestment

would cause Pitt to lose money. “The
board of trustees wants to know how
much money it would lose if it were

to divest,” Tony Baldwin said. “Ac-'

cording to the vice president of the
United States Trust Company, the big-
gest loss with divestment is less 1 per-
cent." _

Barbara Sizemore asked, “Where is
the evidence that an institution will lose
money when it withdraws its capital
from South Africa?”

Rally speakers also addressed the
board» of trustees‘ refusal to make
available to faculty and students the

- university’s investment report. The

pro-divestment factions said they
believe the withholding of the report is
a silent admission on the part of the
board of trustees that divestment would

‘ cause little financial loss to the univer-

sity. Sizemore said she believes that if
the board had evidence that divestment

would be financially ruinous, the board "

would provide this evidence. “But if
the trustees are correct, why do they
withhold the investment report" from
faculty and students?" she asked.
“What are they afraid that we will ﬁnd
out?”

Sizemore also said she believes the

‘board of trustees refuses to divest 
because it is willing to sacrifice the "

university’s moral principles for ﬁnan-
cial gain. “The ultimate reason for this
is greed,” she said, speaking of the
university’s investment in companies"
that conduct business with the Pretoria
government. “It’s simply more impor-
tant to the boardtof trustees tocollect
interest on the blood money from the
work of slaves than it is to stick up for
freedom.” V - ‘

Debaters win region title

The William Pitt Debating Union took first place at a major regional
debating tournament over the weekend.

The team of Andrea Pierce and Pat Kingsley, both sophomores,‘swept
to an undefeated record at the George Mason University Patriot Debates
at Fairfax, Va., winning 11 straight debates against teams from WVU,
Navy, Penn and other schools from the mid-Atlantic region. Pierce and
Kinsley defeated Penn State in the ﬁnal round to win the tournament.

The George Mason tournament is one of the largest in the Northeast
with 70 teams from 30 different colleges and universities. This year’s in-
tercollegiate debate topic regards reform of public elementary and second-
ary schools. The Pitt team’s winning case advocated an end to state-imposed
censorship of high school textbooks.

Around the 

Beirut car bomb, kills 25

Beirut — An estimated 550 lbs. of
explosives hidden in a car exploded
yesterday during lunch hour in a
crowded section of Christian East
Beirut. Lebanese police said that the
blast was so powerful it sent a fireball
down the street which wrecked about
30 automobiles, and nearly destroyed
eight multi-story buildings. At least 25
people were killed and 125 others were
wounded, many of whom were trapped
in their cars. The attack came in an ap-
parent retaliation to Christian opposi-
tion to the Syrian-backed peace efforts.

Foreigners still
trapped in Yemen

Yemen —— At least 1,000 foreigners
are still believed to be trapped inside
war-torn South Yemen as an interna-
tional ﬂotilla of ships remains offshore
to evacuate more refugees. British
evacuees from the country said eight
days of civil war has reduced the capital
city of Aden to a virtual ghost town.
As many as 10,000 people are said to
have died since the fighting began. The
hard-line Marxist rebels reportedly
hold large areas of the capital, but the
president, in a broadcast over Ethiopian
radio, claimed his government is still
in control. _

 

Coup topples
S. African nation

Lesotho — A military coup in
Lesotho toppled the existing govern-
ment led by Prime Minister Chief
Jonathan after his policies incurred an
economic blockade by South Africa,
which surrounds the tiny nation. The
new government, headed by General
Metsing Lekhanya, immediately im-
plemented measures to discuss lifting
the blockade which has kept much-
needed gasoline and medical supplies
from the nation of 1.5 million people
for the last three weeks. Within hours
of the coup, South Africa had sent a
military delegation into Lesotho to
discuss what were called “common
security matters.”

Polish government
puts Walesa on trial

Poland — The Polish government
has decided to put Solidarity founder
Lech Walesa on trial because he ques-
tioned official reports on the turnout
during the last election. Walesa said
only about 60 percent of those eligible
cast ballots in last October’s parliamen-

tary voting, while the official version
said that the turnout was nearly 80
percent.

Drug smuggler
declared a fugitive

HARRISBURG — A Pennsylvania
businessman accused of running one of
the nation’s top drug-smuggling opera-
tions will be declared a fugitive. Assis-
tant U.S. Attorney Gordon Zubrod said
that'43—year-old Frederick Luytjes, of
Coby Pond in Pike County, has ap-
parently ﬂed the country. Luytjes is ac-
cused of providing planes and
recruiting pilots for an operation that
smuggled thousands of pounds of co-
caine into the United States between
1980-1985. He was indicted last month
by a federal grand jury in Harrisburg.
Zubrod said investigators are in the
process of seeking fugitive status for
Luytjes.

Dean search begins; turnout is low

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

A search for a new dean for the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) has
begun. Dean Rosenberg, the current
dean of FAS, will resign after 17 years
of service.

Many questions arise from
Rosenberg’s retirement. Who will be
the new dean, and when will he be ap-
pointed‘? Will there be a change in the
structure of FAS? How will the budget
be managed?

To answer these and other questions.
Jim Maher, chairman of the FAS dean
search committee, held open hearings
on Jan. 15 and 16.

“People who are going to apply for
the position will want to know exactly
what’s going on," said Jeanne Martin.
executive secretary to Rosenberg.

According to Martin. an understand-
ing of what the position is and what it
requires is necessary.

On Jan. 15 approximately 16 people
attended the meeting. On Jan. 16, 12
people were present. and the majority
was from the dean search committee.

anonymous was concerned by the poor
attendance of faculty and staff.
“Whoever is appointed could make
big changes in the way the university
is run.” he said. “People do not realize
the importance nor the power that
comes with the position of the dean."
FAS consists of 30 academic depart-
ments in the arts. natural sciences and
humanities. There are 580 full—time

1986. The new dean may be either
someone from inside the university or
from outside.

Faculty members were concerned
that a decision on the new dean would
be made hastily in order to meet the
July 1 deadline. Some faculty members
also felt that someone from outside the
university would not be as competent
as someone from the inside.

“We ’d love to please the president by having a new
dean by July 1. But there has been no pressure put on

faculty serving 8,000 full—time
undergraduates and 1,300 full—time
graduate students. During fiscal year
‘85. external funding of research pro-
jects totaled approximately $16 million.
As chief executive officer, the dean
of FAS reports directly to the provost
and the president of the university.
At the Jan. 15 meeting Maher said
that President Wesley Posvar would
like to have a new dean by July 1,

‘‘We‘d love to please the president
by having a new dean by July 1," said
Maher. “But there has been no
pressure put on us. We won’t give him
a list of candidates until we have a good
list."

At the Jan. 16 meeting, Bert
Rockman, professor of political
‘science, said that there is a definite
need for a change within the current
system. The job as it stands now is im-

mense. and it will grow increasingly
immense. he said.

"Presently the dean is forced into be-
ing a reactor instead of an initiator."
Rockman said. "[Rosenberg] has very
little effect on staff. He doesn't have
the people to delegate to.

“There's an excess of centralization,
an extreme distance between faculty
and administration," said Rockman.
“The dean needs to be more in touch
with all the departments in FAS."

Martin, however, said that the dean
was in touch with all the departments.

“He was interested in all three divi-
sions — natural sciences, social
sciences and humanities," she said. “I
think that he will be a hard act to
follow."

Maher agreed: “It's unlikely that we
will find someone who can keep as
close a contact with all three divisions
as Rosenberg.“

This is exactly what some of the
faculty are concerned about.

"FAS is large enough, and diverse
enough. that it requires more than a
one-man operation. no matter how ex-
cellent that man may be." said
Rockman.

Having three associate or executive
deans is an idea that Rockman finds in-

teresting. There could be an operational
dean, an appointment dean and a pro-
gramming dean. he said. Thus. there
would be more input by the faculty and
more system to the decision-making
process.

The president and the provost have
said that there will be a dean over the
entire present FAS unit.

“We‘ve been told to search for
someone to fulfill the exact job that
Jerry Rosenberg currently ﬁlls," said
Maher. .

“There may be considerable
reconstruction done,” continued
Maher. “The new clean will probably
have an extended staff. He will pro-
bably also helpin deciding how the
new staff should be structured."

Applications for those who wish to

apply for the position of the dean of ’

FAS are being accepted until Feb. 15.
There are 11 committee members
representing the various faculty,
graduate and undergraduate programs

who will be reviewing the applications..

They have the job of choosing between
three to five candidates to be turned in
to Provost Roger Benjamin and Presi-
dent Wesley Posvar. Benjamin and
Posvar have the final say on who the
new dean of FAS will be. i ‘

Eternal Vigil

Recently Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger,
he of the logic-twisting maxim “peace through
strength,” cautioned Congress against making any
cuts in defense spending. The Soviet Union,
Weinberger insists, in its single—minded quest for
global domination, is responsible for one out of every
four wars currently being waged across the globe. It
follows, then, according to this paranoid vision of
political reality, that the United States cannot let down
its guard against the unrelenting forces of the Soviet
military machine. Indeed, it can only hope to thwart
the Soviet Union’s design for global conquest through
constant vigil and a bloated defense budget.

The Reagan administration, in cahoots with
Weinberger, has never failed to do its utmost to in-
still in Americans an impending sense of peril. Doom

.is defined in terms of a communist takeover that is

imminent should we disable our military by cutting
its budget.

The formula employed by the Reagan administra-
tion is simple: Communists, all communists
everywhere, are pure evil; they storm about the globe
gleefully instigating war against democracy, they
brazenly enslave honest, decent folk, and they will
not rest until they have occupied the White House and
forced President Reagan at gunpoint to sing the
praises of Stalin. Naturally, we as good Americans
should be willing to make any sacrifice, including
economic ruin, to prevent our august president from
suffering such a humbling, ideologically unpalatable
fate.

The point to make is a simple one: the Reagan ad-

ministration has grossly exaggerated the threat posed ,

by the Soviet Union in order to justify an equally gross
defense expenditure. The Soviet Union is not the
ravenous, insatiable aggressor that Mr. Reagan and
Mr. Weinberger would have us believe. On the con-
trary, the Soviet Union is generally a passive, status
quo power much like the United States. It has neither
the resources nor the will to engage in conﬂicts
throughout the world. It does not want to conquer the
world; it merely wants to ensure its own continued
existence. Is that so very evil?

Expert Opinion

The editorial “Art or Eyesore?”
could be condensed into these two
sentences: ‘

“I am incapable of thinking for
myself. Therefore, I will depend on a
small elite to tell me which art is good
and which is bad.”

I am sure the city Art Commission
is thrilled by your acquiescence to their
whims. It certainly bolsters their self-
proclaimed prestige. I am also sure
they are happy to spend your money
to erect something only _ they can
appreciate.

I have a difficult time putting any
stock in what these so-called critical ex-
perts have to say, especially because
I haven’t once heard them defend the
work itself. Instead, their major
defense has been the “reputation” of
the artist. This board’s opinion was
based only on the opinion of other
critics.

The editorialist should be happy that
he keeps company with the people he
considers experts. You are all experts
at allowing someone else to tell you
what to think.

Wendy Rempel
CAS

Often the distinction between the vir-
tue of seeking “expen" advice, and the
perversity of becoming a slave to the
same, is none too obvious. One must
constantly beware of this trap in others,
and in oneself. . -

Indeed, who better to determine the
merit of a work than the people who

. must walk past it every day, or those

who have paid for it? One must never
assume that he, or.anyone else, has the

. sole. correct evaluation on any subject.

Not In Kansas

Letters to th

While the responsible critic notes the
qualifications of others who have
thoughts on the subject, and remembers
these when forming his opinion, he has
no right to discount his own opinion
simply because he “is not qualified.”

Furthermore, the artist should not
concern himself with how the populace
evaluates him, or his works. Neither
should the public be concerned about
the tastes of future generations. If a
piece of art’s time does come, it should
be because the people of that time
decide that it has, not because some
other people believed that it may
someday.

lining up for the next session. In the
fall, the situation was even worse.
Many times, 90 students were in there
at one time.

Because of insurance reasons, the
university had to reduce this number
to 45. The university’s solution to this
was to institute a restricted workout
policy allowing 45 persons to use the

Anymore/Kevin

itor

facility for each one—hour session. This
policy has proven to be ineffective and
unfair. The weight room is still over-
crowded, and students are not able to
freely take advantage of a facility for
which they paid good money.

For these reasons, I propose the
university should expand and update
the Trees Hall weight room and/or
create new facilities. The Trees Hall
facility is small and ancient. Even many
high school weight rooms are larger
and more modern than Pitt’s. Expan-
sion is the only realistic solution.
Sometime next week, opinion polls
concerning this matter will be
distributed at Trees Hall. If you would
like to see this matter taken care of,
take time to fill it out. Also, a few more
letters would not hurt.

If you think of a society as a struc-
ture, then the individual would be the
building block of that structure. Each
block ﬁts the other by conforming to
the blocks around it. By contrast, a
round stone would not be ideal for a
brick wall.

In our society today, it seems as
though more andmore individuals are

fitting into this great brick wall of
society without any attempt to be dif-
ferent. Even those who profess to be
different are really different only from

some other group. Take, for example.
punk rockers; if you were to place 10
of them together in the same room (yes,
I know it’s a disturbing thought) you
would recognize a distinct pattern of
habit, manner of thinking and of
course, style of dress.

Were these people like this before
they entered their g_rou_p_?_ (By this I
mean, did‘ they already think as they do
now, and therefore, nothing could have
prevented them from their destiny.) I

don’t think so; it was probably the
result of peer pressure. rebelliousness
and their own idea of where they ﬁt.

I don't mean" to center only on the
punk-rock crowd. I could just as easi-
ly have used jocks, frats or some other
easily identiﬁable group. My point,
though, is that our society has lost the
idea of the individual. Everybody ﬁts
into one particular group or another,
adopting the style and habits of that
particular group.

Many of you may not agree with my
existential view (especially those in the
groups I mentioned), but there is no de-
nying that I am correct. This type of
structure leads to a “pecking order”
and as is often the case, the most ob-
noxious group leads the pecking group.
Wear the Wayfarers, pull up your
sweatpant legs to calf length (this gives
an appearance of indifference) —— as
long as you can seem casual or cool,
then you will remain on top.

“Coolness” is of course the im-

perative and death to thosewho do not
achieve it. I realize of course that I am

ﬁghting a losing battle; after a few I I "

seconds of enlightenment, most of you
will simply go back to your secure lit-’
tle groups. Well, it’s time to put my

From the start, Ronald Reagan has
had a gift for the well-chosen line. In
1980, he regained control of a can-
didates’ forum by using a line from the
movie “State of the Union”: “I am
paying for this microphone.” Later, he
quoted Jack Dempsey to Nancy Reagan
in explaining how he got shot:
“Honey, I forgot to duck.” And more
recently, he celebrated the capture of
the Achille Lauro hijackers by
paraphrasing yet another prize ﬁghter,
Joe Lewis. “You can run, but you
can’t hide,” the president exulted.

But a charming attribute has now
become a liability. Both the president
and lesser administration ofﬁcials have
been sounding off about terrorism as
if the Moammar Khadafys of the world
were movie bad guys. He and his of-
ﬁcials talk tough, scramble jets, put the
ﬂeet (or parts of it) to sea and then
nothing happens. This administration
talks loudly, carries a big stick. But (to
paraphrase a line the president has used)

it has mostly made Khadafy’s day. He
is sitting tall in the saddle, even if it
is a tractor.

The record is dismal. Aside from the
capture of the Achille Lauro hijackers,
a collection of dimwits who surren-
dered their hostages and then hopped
an Egyptian plane to promised sanc-
tuary, the United States has done poor-

ly in either capturing or punishing ter- .

rorists. One only has to be reminded
that the killers of 264 American
Marines are still free and presumably
still circulating, as are the ones who
murdered American diplomats in
Beirut. The same can be said for the
hijackers of TWA Flight 847 — the
ones who took the plane, the ones who
killed an American sailor and the ones
who held American hostages in Beirut.
Even now, Americans remain pris-
oners in that city.

By now, we all know something
about terrorism. It is difﬁcult to pre-
vent and more difﬁcult to punish.

Nothing was more ludicrous than the
United States’ sending FBI agents to
Beirut after the TWA hijacking, but it
was also symbolic of the difﬁculties in-
volved. We are out of our element: col-
lege graduates with neat ‘haircuts and
brown shoes presumably going house-
to-house in Shiite neighborhoods. God
help us!

Terrorist groups are shadowy,
almost impossible to penetrate, on the
move, suckered by some governments,
sheltered by still others. They swim in
a sea that’s either hospitable to them
or the cause they proclaim. Justice
demands their capture and punishment.
Justice, though, lacks the wherewithal
to pull it off.

And Moammar Khadafy, the God-
father of terrorism whose killers have
repeatedly struck, has suddenly become
the darling of other Arabs simply
because the United States, not to men-
tion Israel, would like to see him stone-
cold dead in the market. It seems not

to have occurred to "the Arabs in
general nor the Palestinians in par-
ticular that Khadafy soils their cause".
They could use a better champion.
But at least when it comes to
mouthing off, Khadafy has met his
match in this administration. Time after
time, it promises what it cannot deliver.
The result is that the question of honor
— of losing. face — becomes an issue.
It need not be. The Soviets, for in-

stance, had two of their diplomats kid-

napped in Beirut last year and one of
them, Arkady Katkov, killed and
unceremoniously dumped in a
wasteland. Yet not one threat was
heard from Moscow. Presumably it
will do what it thinks it has to do and
theless said about it, the better.

Not so the United States. It beats its

already complicated situation by inject-
ing honor into it. Even if it [honor]

waits for us to act. We said we would

The result is that to a degree we have
lost freedom of action —— the freedom
not to act until we absolutely want to,
to hit the target of our choosing, not
the Iﬁrst to come along. We have turned

an issue of justice into one of face.

High noon approaches.

Khadafy ought to get what he has
coming. So should all terrorists. The
killers of innocent people, the
murderers of children have to ‘be
brought to justice. Revenge may be
sweet and retribution useful, but justice
is a solemn obligation — to the dead
and the bereaved certainly, but also to
the living. That said, nothing more
should be said. If a Hollywood model
is needed, it should not be a Ronald
Reagan ﬁlm but one that starred John‘
Wayne. It‘s called “The Quiet Man.”

Brutus is a world-renowned poet and
is presently teaching at Swarthmore
College. He will assume his post as
chairman ofthe Black Studies Depart-
ment in September 1986, and in his
speech at Carlow College, ‘Brutus said
this of his coming stay at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, “I am going to stir
up a whole lot of trouble when I get
here."

I leaders regime that jailed him twice and

shot him in the back in the early 1960s-
for trying to escape, thinks that divest-
ment is a key issue in ending South
I Africa’s misery.

In his address at Carlow College, '
Brutus said, I have to say that the suf-
fering in South Africa that I saw when
I broke stones [in jail] with Nelson
Mandela could be stopped if that little
racist [government] in Pretoria was

withdrawal of the United States’
economic support would quickly send
the Botha administration tumbling
downhill, perhaps destroying it all
together.

Brutus believes that 1986 will be a
pivotal year for South Africa’s future.
He thinks divestment will continue at
a rapid pace, and he is not worried that
the University of Pittsburgh has not yet
liquidated its South African assets. The

A — Dennis Brutus

the amount of money it has tied up in
South African assets (about $38
million), will take longer to divest than
smaller, private schools, but Brutus is
ce'rtain that the divestiture will happen.

Brutus also thinks that by the end of
1986 we could see the Pretoria govern-
ment on the point of collapse. What
Brutus is worried about is that the
United States would provide economic
and military aid to the crumbling
regime. This would be a disaster,
Brutus thinks, both for the United
States and for South Africa. He
vehemently believes that the Reagan
administration should be pressured in-
to not letting this happen.

Brutus believes that good poetry
springs from an honesty with the self.

The Pitt News, January 22, 19,86

Apartheid and prison shape Brutus’ work

At Carlow College, Brutus said, “It is
really easy to write poetry; what you
need is honesty. If you say truthfully
what you think and feel, then you are
on your way to becoming a poet.”

In explaining his statement that “the '

prisons of South Africa gave birth to
my poetry.” Brutus said that “prison
allowed me a chance to think about my
poetry."

In prison he decided that his previous
poetry had been too sentimental, deal-
ing with traditional adolescent love pro-
blems instead of his own political reali-
ty. Brutus said that ever since he has
left prison, the theme _of his poetry has
been freedom.

Brutus is unhappy with other South
African writers who in their work
criticize apartheid but who in life con-
tinue to live comfortably in white South
Africa. Brutus criticized_Athol Fugard.
world—famous dramatist, author of
“Master l-larold and the Boys.” for
showing in his plays the dead-end,
desperate situation of South African
blacks without offering any hope for
their eventual freedom. Brutus believes
that in the near future justice will be
had for 70 percent ofthe South African
population that lives in poverty and is
at the mercy of the Pretoria
Government.

On the subject of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr., Brutus disdains referring to
the slain civil rights leader as a
dreamer. “What was special was not
that he had a dream,” said Brutus.’
"Everybody has a dream; what was
special was that he tried to make his
dream a reality.”

The dream Brutus would like to see
incarnate is freedom and justice for
everybody in South Africa, and Brutus
said that “if Martin was here today he
would be calling to stop support of
South Africa.”

Divestment

continued from page 1

Professor Dennis Brutus, South
African poet as well as new chairman
of the black studies department.
reminded the audience that, many years
ago. Martin Luther King Jr. had call-
ed for an economic and cultural boycott

of South Africa. _
Brutus also pleaded for divestment
' from South Africa. “Really, what we
are asking you to do is astonishingly
simple,” he said. “We are asking you
simply to stop doing something that you
are doing. Something that is wrong to
do. something that is shameful to do
and that is hypocritical to do. Help us
to stop them from investing in oppres-
sion and profiting from oppression."
Brutus was jailed twice in South
Africa in the early 1960s as an oppo-
nent of the government, and was
sentenced to hard labor on an -island
splitting rocks with Nelson Mandela.
On his second escape attempt, Brutus
was shot in the back, a shot he called
a “through and through” because the
bullet came out of his chest. Brutus’

recollection of that thwarted escape at-
tempt gives what he believes is a clear
picture of apartheid practices. "As I lay
on the sidewalk, surrounded by
members of the secret police, an am-
bulance arrived.” he said. recounting
the moments immediately following his
shooting. “Men in uniform got out of
the ambulance, took their stretcher,
came over to me, took a look at me,
took their stretcher and put it back in
the ambulance, got in the ambulance,
and drove away. And I was very a-
larmed. and I said to the secret police.
‘What‘s happened? I need that am-
bulance!’ And they said, ‘But Brutus.
you don’t want those men to get into
trouble. That‘s an ambulance for
whites. If they put you in there they
will lose their jobs. You have to wait
for the black ambulance.’ So I waited
for the black ambulance.”

At the end of the rally, Rashid Soun-
diata, political action chairman for the
Black Action Society and a founding
member of Students for a Free South

A petition has been signed by 103 of
Pitt’s athletes urging the university’s
board of directors to withdraw its
stocks and investments from companies
doing business in South Africa.

Keith Tinsley, a member of the foot-
ball team, organized the effort. He said
petitions are still being circulated", and
he expects significant support from the
athletes. Asked if he would like to see
Pitt’s athletes involved in the national
organization “Athletes Against Apart-
held," Tinsley responded, “I’d like to

see as much action as possible for the
anti-apartheid movement at Pitt.”

Presently, however, the athletes are
giving their support to the university’s
anti-apartheid movement in general
rather than seeking recognition as a
separate organization.

In a similar effort, Jake Millione,
chairman of Pittsburghers Against
Apartheid, has begun a petition among
the university’s faculty. Millione,
however, could not be reached for
comment.

Pittsburgh has been called the most
livable city, the city of champions and
the steel city. But it is also a city in
transition, according to Vince Gaget-
ta, co-author of a forthcoming book
tentatively titled “Pittsburgh: Pulling
Together, Forging Ahead.” Writing
the book with Gagetta is Jack
Markowitz, the current business editor
of The Tribune Review.

Gagetta, assistant director of the
Department of News and Publications
at the University of Pittsburgh, said the
text will be used as a vehicle to pro-
mote economic development in" the
Pittsburgh area.

The book, sponsored by the Greater
Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce,
will primarily deal with the financial
future of the city. Gagetta said that he
wanted to avoid writing a strictly
historical account of past industrial
achievements. '

“Although there is some history of
the beginning of the steel industry,” he
said. “the real focus of the text is what

' could happen, what is likely to happen,

as we make a transition from a steel to
a service—related economy.

Pitt and CMU would have the oppor-
tunity to get the more powerful and
sophisticated Cray X-MP/48. The Cray
X-MP/48 is at least ﬁve times faster
than the Cray l-S and is the most
powerful machine of its kind. It has

Supercomputers are the fastest, most

Gagetta, a former editor of the Pitts-
burgh Business Times Journal, has
been researching material for the book
since July 1985. The research consisted
of interviews of chief executive officers
of corporations in the Pittsburgh area.

Gagetta learned from his interviews
that a good relationship between local
government and industry is needed if
Pittsburgh is ‘to remain attractive to
potential investors.

“Despite the unemployment in the
city, there exists a great deal of
cooperation with the city and local cor-
porations,” he said. “Without that
cooperation, Renaissance I and II
would not have- taken place.”

Gagetta went on to say that the city
has to create an atmosphere that will
attract a lot of small businesses, instead
of trying to find one large employer.

Gagetta also said that he believes
there is a stumbling block preventing
business growth in the Pittsburgh area
because of the once—prosperous steel in-
dustry. Gagetta said that problem is the
decline of steel, the industry that gave
Pittsburgh its blue-collar image.

“A lot of people cannot accept that
the steel mills are not going to come
back,” he said. "Many unemployed
steel workers were retrained for jobs
that did not exist.”

Gagetta said it was hard to predict

organizations are sending. on Jan. 21.
a telegram to Winnie Mandela vowing
their support for her cuase. "We‘re
sending this telegram to you to show
our solidarity with and support for the
masses of Azania [South Africa] in
your struggle for national liberation,"
the telegram states. "We express our
unconditional support for you in your
resistance to the unjust laws of apart-
held.“

Winnie Mandela is the wife of
Nelson Mandela, a political leader who
has been in jail in South Africa for at
least 17 years. Winnie Mandela has
become a political figure on her own
in this past year, and on Jan. 22, she
will be on trail for disobeying a ban-
ning order. The banning order was to
restrain her from leaving a Johan-
nesburg suburb. She wants to return to
her home in Soweto.

After the rally, which lasted about an
hour, some of the speakers and spon-
sors of the rally walked to the Cathedral
of Learning and marched for approx-
imately 45 minutes, chanting “Down
with apartheid, up with the people”
and “No business with South Africa.”

The attendance at the rally was poor.
Less than half the chairs were taken in
the Student Union Ballroom. Doug

member of Students for a Free South

disappointed him, said: “It bothered
me. But it was the Friday afternoon

- before a big weekend and that was the

wrong time to have a rally.”

Both Students for a Free South
Africa and the Black Action Society
said they have events planned for
January and February and will continue
pressuring the board of trustees into
releasing their investment statement.
Tony Baldwin said: “We are going to
keep protesting this until we get the
board of trustees to reopen the issue of
divestment.”

would be a “hot ticket” for landing a
job. He said the real key for employ-
ment growth is diversiﬁcation.

“If we are going to be a-high-tech
city with computers, we will be one of
many,” he said_. “You cannot corner
the market on technology or competi-
tion. We cannot put all of our eggs in
one basket like we did with steel.”

Gagetta cited the health care profes-
sion as one of Pittsburgh’s leading
industries.

“Pittsburgh’s most important prod-
uct in the health care field is informa-
tion,” said Gagetta, “[which includes]
the result of research done in
transplants and in other related ﬁelds.”

Despite the loss of heavy industry,
Pittsburgh is still known as the cor-
porate headquarters for many
businesses. Gagetta cited Mellon Bank
and Pittsburgh National Bank as being
the two leading financial institutions in
the state that have their corporate of-
fices located in Pittsburgh.

The book, to be published in 1986
by Windsor Publications, is not meant
to predict the future but “to be a guide

to what we have to do to get things .

done in a realistic and positive way,"
said Gagetta.

to be a more systematic sounding of
how the faculty feels about these
changes.”

' Irwin Schulman, CAS dean and '

member of the Calendar Review Com-
mittee, responded to Katz’s objections.

“It’s true that from the point of view
of faculty, the calendar would be disad-
vantageous,” he said. “We are unique
to have such a compressed schedule,
but students don’t get their money’s
worth. Every other major university
has a longer calendar.”

Schulman noted that the changes in
the calendar would be advantageous
from an educational perspective, pro-
viding a more relaxed academic
experience.

“From the point of view of teaching
and learning, a longer term would be
better,” he said. “Along around
February or March, students need a
break. The faculty doesn’t want to give
upthe concrete advantage of having a
more compressed term of an abstract
advantage associated with student pro-
ductivity. ”

Schulman said postponing the open-
ing of the winter term by one week
would make time for an orientation
period for new students.

“We get a lot of students who start
Pitt in January,” he said. “When we
start immediately, we don’t have time
to advise any of these students.
Postponing the beginning of the winter
term by one week would give new
students time for orientation in-
quiries.”

Ethel Cook, CAS junior, agrees: “I

like the idea of starting later in January.
Most other schools do. My friends at
home are usually home for a month,
while I’m home only for two weeks.”

She disagrees, however, with the

proposed spring vacation inserted into
the winter term.

‘ ‘It would be nice to have time off, ’ ’
she said, “but it would be hard to en-
joy a vacation when you know in the
back of your mind that finals are go-
ing to start as soon as you get back.
Besides, I don’t have the money to go
to Florida. Even if I did, it’s only a
week. By the time I got there, I’d have
to come back.”

‘ ‘I like the idea of start-
ing later in January. Most ‘
other schools do. My
friends are usually" home
for a month, while I ’m on-
ly home for two weeks. ”

— Ethel Cook, Junior,
CAS

Sean Damico, CAS junior, also
dislikes the idea of a spring break.
“The way the calendar is now, we get
out three weeks before anybody else,”
he said, “job openings go fast in the

. summer, so we have a great advantage.

I have to make money to go to school
next year, so I wouldn’t be wasting
$100 that I really don’t have in the mid-
dle of the term to go home.”

Damico didn’t see himself traveling
to the beach, either. “Students who
have the money to go to Fort Lauder-
dale don’t need summer jobs,” he said.

Responding to the suggestion that
Pitt’s current winter term calendar is
too compressed, Damico again
disagreed.

ARE YOU REACTIVE?
We are looking for a few good men — between the ages
of 18 and 27 who quality for a study of Blood Pressure
Reactivity. If you are ‘interested, come to the Lothrop Hall
Lobby and have your blood pressure checked. Those who
qualify and complete the study will be paid $100.00.

“The person who thinks the term is
too compressed is the one blowing off
all his work," he said. “I have no sym-
pathy for him.”

Also included in the proposed calen-
dar changes is the consolidation of all
third-term offerings into a single
10-week summer term. As it is, Pitt of-
fers three different terms: a full-length
spring term and two seven-week
sessions.

According to information presented
to FASC, the third-term offerings no
longer attract as many fall and winter
term students as they once did, and
market surveys of people who only at-
tend summer sessions show a
dissatisfaction with the calendar as it
is scheduled.

“Running the second session into
mid-August makes it very difficult for
these people, usually high school
teachers and students from other
universities, to attend,” said J.L.
Rosenberg, FASC chairman.

“During the summer, we give our
graduate students an opportunity to
teach courses with full responsibility,”
said Gale. “Eliminating the two seven-
week summer sessions would
significantly cut down on the oppor-
tunities to teach such courses.”

As a group, the FASC was not
satisfied with the changes proposed for
the academic calendar. In lieu of op-
posing the suggested changes, the com-
mittee is requesting further study to
“provide a factual basis for making
these inferences.”

Dean Schulman was not surprised to
hear of the FASC’s decision. “Any
calendar that one comes up with is not
going to be perfect for everyone or
every purpose,” he said, “but I feel
that the advantages of these changes
outweigh the disadvantages.”

in search for career options

By Kelly I. Shaffer

Assistant Features Editor

As graduation nears, seniors are
thinking of freedom from books,
papers and homework. And as
diplomas are received and caps are
thrown in the air at graduation, the
future seems shining and bright. Seems.

After the glow of this milestone oc-
casion has worn off, reality must be
faced. The rent must be paid; bills are
due and student loan payments are
looming ahead.

The obvious answer to reality is to
get a job, and not just a job — but a
career. .

It seems so easy to say, “I’ll get a
job. I’ve had four years of college, so
I’m ready to start my career."
However, it’s easier to say than it is
to accomplish. When you plan to pur-
sue a career, it is not as simple as mere-
ly getting a job.

“There are two kinds .ofjobs. One
job you take because of the money. The
other job you take for the experience,
whether it’s well-paying or not,” said
Robert Hopkins, the director of the
University Placement Service.

“Experience isn’t what happens to
you; it’s what you do with what hap-
pens to you. A career is 10 years of ex-
perience. A job is one year of ex-
perience repeated lO times,” explained
Hopkins.

Hopkins said he feels that companies
are looking for applicants with ex-
perience rather than the 4.0 grade point
average. “Employers are looking for
someone who has done something —
if you have only done schooling, then
they probably only accept an A-minus
average. But if you have some sort of
job experience, you’re showing another
new dimension. Experience makes a
clear point to employers. You’ve learned
about how things are held together in

the business world,” said Hopkins.

Experience can be gained through in-
ternships, volunteer positions or part-

Campus B  

Research and planning aid

time jobs. Internships are available for

_most of the majors here at Pitt. They

are considered to be sound academic
experiences and good resume material.

Also, volunteer positions are
valuable opportunities to gain ex-
perience. Hospitals, aid agencies and
charitable organizations are often will-
ing to take on volunteers.

“It’s not too late for the second-term
seniors. Go for a part-time job; you’ll
be working for experience,” said
Hopkins. “Use it to learn more about
the business world; inventory, schedul-
ing and money management. Com-
panies look at a resume and ask: ‘You
worked at Wendy’s — what did you

job you take because of the
money. The other job you

learn?’ ” A

Hopkins stressed that merely ﬁlling
in hours at a job is not gaining ex-
perience. He pointed out that one
should use this opportunity to under-
stand how businesses work.

This information gathering process
can take place right on the Pitt campus,
by using the various libraries to study
different companies in Pittsburgh and
throughout the United States. Prior
knowledge of various careers and com-
panies provides a basis for the career
search. 

“Use research facilities available
here in the placement service or in the
library to learn about corporations, the
working world and how businesses are
run,” said Hopkins. “Use the

academic tools, the facilities and the
faculty to learn more about the business
world. _

“It makes it difﬁcult when students
live in a monastic academic world.
They have no knowledge of what
business is, why people get paid. They
need to apply their discipline to the
world of business,” Hopkins added.

The aforementioned research should
be done prior to any physical searching
for a job. According to Hopkins, “The
physical looking for ajob is one ofthe
last things to do. Your success depends
on what you have done before look-
ing.”

When beginning the physical “look-
ing for a job,” there are several steps
one should take.

“My best advice is to us_e the. cam-
pus placement service. It is obvious that
this is the best place for students to go.
Once out of college, the chances are
much diminished. There is greater
competition outside,” said Pat Olivo,
a Certiﬁed Personnel Consultant at the
Alternative Employment Service.

The University Placement Service is
an ofﬁce that provides information,
counseling and workshops for the
students. One attends an introductory
session which explains the services and
resources available at the center.
Workshops on interviewing skills,
resume writing and job searching are
held frequently in the WPU 236 ofﬁce.
Career counselors are also available for
discussions and guidance.

The placement service also has
listings for over 150 companies and
provides recruitment opportunities with
Pittsburgh-based and national com-
panies. “We don’t tell you what job to
take. We give you information so that
you can choose and execute a job
search plan,” said Hopkins.

However, time is a factor in the
usage of the placement service. “We
started working with the 1986
graduates on Sept. 1, 1985. Students
should register as soon as possible. Our
programs are of a cyclical nature,”
Hopkins continued. “We have
workshops and recruiting sessions that
are offered in a certain order. So the
students are missing out on these op-
portunities. Recruiters are only here

The Pitt Employment Ofﬁce, in
Room 172 Thackeray, offers. job op-
portunities to all graduates. Any job
available in the university system will
be posted in the ofﬁce. They also have
bulletin boardsposted throughout the
campus: in the basement of the
Cathedral of Learning, the third ﬂoor
of Forbes Quadrangle, Benedum Hall
and Scaife Hall. It is suggested that
students apply at the ofﬁce one month
prior to graduation.

Outside Oakland’s ﬁeld of academia
are professional employment agencies.
Most agencies have specialized ﬁelds
of job placement such as accounting,
clerical or management training. When
one registers with a speciﬁc agency,
there is a contract and fee involved. In
some cases, the fee is paid by the pro-
spective employer.

“I’d say that approximately 80 per-
cent of the fees we charge are paid by

once. The candidates are being searched
for right now. Companies are ﬁlling the
positions right away.”

The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh,
on Forbes Avenue, is another source
for information about employment op-
portunities. Although it is not a place-
ment service, the Job Information
Center provides the qualiﬁcations need-j
ed for various careers, lists oppor-
tunities in chosen ﬁelds of interest and
has tips on writing resumes and inter-
viewing techniques. The Job Informa-
tion Center is free to the public and

cellent networking, par-

open seven days a week.

After the information has been
assembled, the students should then
look to agencies, services and organiza-
tions that can gain access to the job
market. As mentioned before, the
placement service is one option for the
career-developing student. However,
other Pitt agencies are also available to
Pitt students.

“An important resource that the stu-
dent should utilize is the alumni club.
That is the most important resource
available to the student.“ said Olivo.

"You do this by contacting the alum-
ni office and finding out what alumnae
are with what company, and they will
put you in touch with them,” said
Olivo. “This is really the most effec-
tive way to look for a job, especially
if you want to work for a speciﬁc com-
pany. This is excellent networking,
particularly for the students who want
to work in this city. We have alumni
everywhere, in all types of companies
and occupations around the city.”

’ .

the employer. When you go with our
agency, your name will be kept on the
lists for a year. I’d suggest to come and
apply around the end of February.
Most positions are to be filled within
four weeks,” said Barbara Shillinger
of Barry Leonard Personnel.

“Only licensed employment agen-
eies can charge a fee. In the case of our
agency, about 80 percent of the fees are
paid by the applicant." said Olivo.
“However. only 5-8 percent are entry-
level positions.”

Olivo had suggestions as to other
methods of securing a job. “There's
the classiﬁed section in the newspapers.
Also, you can visit the companies
themselves. Send speciﬁc companies a
resume and a cover letter. In the let-
ter, suggest a follow-up visit and then
call for an appointment.”

According to Olivo, one should net-
work the different corporations.
“When you talk to one company, find

out the names of their competitors.

x
,  .2?/.:a tr.

mm ,

Also, network the professors and facul-
ty at the university. The old saw ap-
plies here: ‘It.’ s not what you know —
but who you know.‘ ”

As the student begins to make head- ‘

way, he will need the introduction tool
of job hunting — the resume. A resume
is quite possibly the only contact be-
tween a graduate and a corporation. It
should contain contact information, the
objectives, education and honors re-
ceived, experience and employment

- history and special skills that might be

applicable to the job being sought.

It is suggested that the resume should
state that references and/or portfolios
will be furnished upon request. If called
for an interview, take extra copies of
the resume and references/portfolios in
case of multiple interviewers. Pitt’s
placement service and Carnegie’s Job
Information Center can provide
resume-writing guidelines. There are
also professional resume services. The
price differs according to length and
speciﬁcations.

A resume probably should not be
longer than one page and should be
well-organized, meticulously neat and
error free.

If the resume makes a good impres-

‘ sion and if you are qualiﬁed for a posi-

tion, the company (or the student) will
call and make an appointment for an
interview.

This part of the job-hunting process
often strikes terror in the hearts of ap-
plicants. The purpose of an interview
is to familiarize the applicant with the
company and to provide the employer
with an opportunity to “check out” the
prospective employee. “Any employer
will hire any individual he is convinced
will bring more value than his costs.
Make it sound like hiring you is
beneficial to them,” advised Tom
Jackson, a leading job expert.

According to Drake Beam Morin,
Inc., a New York-based human
resources company, there are four

basic interviewer personality proﬁles.

They are based on Carl Jung’s
behavioral theories. .
In an interview with the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette last year. the company
stated that a fast, careful look at how
the interviewer's ofﬁce is arranged and
what he is wearing will place him in
one of the four proﬁles. By studying
the interviewer, the applicant can judge
what questions to expect and -how to
answer them most effectively.

The first profile is titled the “sen- V

 c

sor" type. He is very present-oriented

continued from page 9

and responds to materialistic things he
can touch or feel. This type can be
identiﬁed by his casual dress, his seem-
ingly disorganized ofﬁce and his clut-
tered desk. The graduate can expect
him to focus on his experience as a

' problem solver.

The second personality proﬁle is
called the “feeler.” This type bases his
judgments on emotions and gut reac-
tions. The interviewer needs human
contact and enjoys people in general.
He can be recognized by the family
photos, souvenirs and awards placed
throughout his ofﬁce. It is suggested
that he will be fashion—conscious. This
interviewer type usually focuses on the
applicant’s relationships with others
and how he will enjoy the job.

Type number. three is known as the
“thinker.” He is logical, orderly and

data—oriented. This is shown by the -

orderly desk and ofﬁce, which may

 

A conservative dresser, he will focus
on facts and ﬁgures. The applicant
should answer his questions with great
detail.

The last type is called the “intuitor. ”
This is a very future-oriented person
who sets goals for himself and others.
His desk will be covered with reports
and scholarly books, as well as having
projection charts hanging on the walls.
His focus will be on the applicant’s
long-terrn goals. When answering his
questions, correlate your past ex-
periences with future demands of the
position and the movement of the
company.

In the case of any type of interviewer
or job situation, one should appear to
be conﬁdent and positive about your
qualiﬁcations and experience. Present
yourself in the best possible light so as
to appeal to interviewers.

Appealing to future employers,
knowing about the company, present-

ing an impressive resume and appear-
ing self-conﬁdent during interview
situations are objectives of the job
search field. However,.even with the
utmost preparation, the job offer might
never materialize. If that happens,
“[d]on’t take it personally. There’s
nothing wrong with you or what you
did in college. The job market is
tight,” said Olivo

The main thing is to keep on look-
ing. “Very few people have one con-
tact, one interview and get a job. Many
activities lead to a job. The job search
is like rolling a rock uphill. It takes
momentum. The more you do, the
more you can do. Similarly, the more
you learn the more you can learn.
However, you have to overcome iner-
tia,” said Hopkins. ‘ '

In other words, you have to make an
effort. The plum jobs don't come
knocking on your door.

   

  ADVERTISE.
 FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

Engineering and computers 

 

dominateoareer opportunities again in 1986

By Nadia Moritz
Features Editor

The most promising career ﬁelds
available in Pittsburgh for graduating
college seniors this year are consistent
with the national trends of engineering,
computer science, accounting and
business, according to William Dee,
owner of William Dee Personnel, Inc. ,
an employment service in Forest Hills.

“Engineering is still the most
sellable degree,” said Dee. The order
of opportunity in engineering, accord-
ing to degree, proceeds as mechanical,
electrical, civil, industrial and then
chemical. The starting salaries, accord-
ing to Dee, are usually $20,000 or over
per year.

Other top—selling degrees are, in
order of prevalence, computer pro-
grammers (with a BS in computer
science or informational systems), ac-
counting and business, all of which
have been among the top fields for
much of the last decade. According to
Dee, who has a specialization in
engineering and whose company works

“Engineering is -still the

- most sellable degree. ”

“There is a lot of opportunity for
people going into sales,” said Dobbs.
“Not a lot of people in college pursue
sales from the very beginning. But
there are usually. more good sales jobs
available than there are good people to
fill them.”

Despite the employment trends
toward engineering and computers that
have dominated the choices of outgo-
ing seniors, the choices of incoming
freshmen seem to be following a dif-
ferent path. According to a report

co eges and universities with 192,453
members of the 1985 fall freshman
class.

The most popular choice for majors,
according to the study, was business.
Computers dropped from 6.1 percent
in 1984 to 4.4 percent in 1985, and
there was a decline in engineering from

10.4 percent in 1984 to 10 percent in -

1985.
“This declining
technological careers stands in stark

contrast to the growing national con- _

cem for increased technological capaci-
ty in the American work force,” said
the report. Although according to Dee,
in the Pittsburgh area there is still an
overabundance of manpower in these
areas.

A more optimistic change in career
choices, according to the Cooperative
Institute Research Program report, was
revealed in the ﬁeld of education and

teaching. As the population increase —

continues to add to the teacher short-
age, more freshmen are planning to
pursue careers in teaching. The per-
centage of this pursuit rose from 5.5
percent in 1984 to 6.2 percent in 1985.

Pennsylvania legislature was the only
individual to favor the Constitution in
that body. It may not be well known,
but Brackenridge also had an active
role in halting the Whiskey Rebellion.
In 1791, Congress passed a tax on grain
alcohol, unpopular in southwestern
Pennsylvania, probably due to the fact
that twenty—five percent of the stills ex-
isted in this area. In addition,
westerners used beer and wine as a cur-
rency. Although federal army threats
disbanded the rebel army,
Brackenridge, who had been inﬂuen-
tial in determining public opinion, also
played an active role in calming the
uprising.

Before he died in 1816,
Brackenridge became leader of the
Pittsburgh Jeffersonian party and also
received an appointment as a justice of
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

Although he is often criticized for
failing to make the distinction between
propaganda and the responsibilities of
a serious author, Brackenridge,

The Pitt News, January 22, 1986

Sports Editor

Just last weekend, freshman Jerome
Lane sounded off because he was
unhappy with his role as power forward

\ on the Pitt basketball team. He claimed

he would rather play sparingly at small
forward than play a great deal at power
forward. Well, times change, and
although a week has not yet passed
since ‘Lane sounded off, his role has
changed. Lane will be running the Pan-
ther offense tonight when Pitt squares
off with Boston College at the field
house. '
Lane, the pre—season Freshman of
the Year in the Big East, had been us-
ed sparingly the previous two games.
A hip-pointer‘ injury sufferedby senior
Joey Davidjust two minutes into Pitt's
95-76 victory over Duquesne on Mon-
day night, thrust him back into a ma-
jor role. He responded by scoring 14
points and dishing out seven assists
while playing 30 minutes. Pitt head
coach Roy Chipman was happy to have
the real Jerome Lane back in the
lineup, but offered some caution when
the subject of Boston College came up.
“I thought he played real well,”
Chipman said after the game, “but we
were in a situation where we were not
really pressured. Duquesne showed us

some 1-3-1 zone which was real easy

for Jerome to see over and get our run-
ning game going.” Chipman added,
referring to Boston College, “The
situation on Wednesday is going to be
a little bit different. Boston College is
going to come out and zone press us
all over the court. How he will handle
the ball against all that pressure remains
to be seen. It should be some good
basketball.”

Coming out of high school, Lane was
known as a man who could do it all.
As Chipman phrased it, “He was the
kind of player that would bring the ball

up the court, pass it to the wing, then,

move inside.” Duquesne head coach
Jim Satalin learned that the hard way
on Monday night.

“I think the worst thing that could
have happened to us was when Joey

The Panther wrestling team has con-
tinued its assault against wrestling foes
as they downed Ashland College,
25-17, at Trees Hall, Saturday. The’
win moves the Panthers to 4-0-1 in dual
meet competition. Ashland’ iwas
previously rated fifth in the nation i-n
Division II. .

Leading the way for Pitt was
freshman Pat Santoro as he pinned his
second straight opponent, upping his
record to 18-4 on the year. Santoro
decked Tony Molchak with six seconds
to go in the second period.

The Panthers were without their
three seniors: Joe BOnd, John Hnath
and Kyle Nellis. Both Bond and Hnath

David got hurt,” Satalin said. “Jerome
Lane came in and played a great
game.”

Lane will be the third point guard
that Chipman will use extensively this
season. Curtis Aiken began the season
at point guard, but switched to off
guard following Chipman’s resignation
on Dec. 18. David took over and has
played perhaps his best basketball since
he arrived at Pitt. When David went
down. Chipman did not even consider
moving Aiken back to the point.

“Curtis will play some point guard
to the point that we need to rush
somebody or something like that,”
Chipman said. “Right now, Curtis is
shooting the ball well and playing com-
fortably. He is really doing some nice
things. I think to change right now
would not be in the best interests of the
team or'Curtis.” '

Aiken put on_ a shooting clinic Mon-
day night, scoring 21 points, 20 of
which came via deep jumpers. He also
dished out eight assists. Satalin was
referring to Aiken when he said, “I
was most impressed with the job they
did shooting the ball from the outside.”

So it seems that Pitt is set with ‘Lane
and Aiken at the guards for the time
being. According to Pitt Basketball
Publicist Kimball Smith, David is
doubtful for Saturday’s game with St.
John’s.

“We are just going to have to work
awﬁilly hard,” Chipman said. “We are
going to have to play Jerome at point.
I’m just worried about the pressure.”

Notes: The game will be televised
nationally by USA Network, but will
be blacked out within a 35-mile
radius of Pittsburgh  A sellout
crowd 6,798 is expected. As of yester-
day afternoon, the student allotment

_ had already been sold out for '
tonight’s game, but tickets still re-

mained for Saturday’s nationally
televised St. John’s game  The
Panthers record is now 12-5 overall,
still 3-3 in the Big East  Freshman
point guard Mike Goodson, who ex-
pressed displeasure over not seeing
action in Monday’s game, may play
more than usual tonight should Lane
have trouble with Boston College’s
pressure.

missed the match due to illness and are

expected to be back in action'tomor-

row as Pitt travels to Kent State.
However, for Nellis it’s a bit more

_serious. He was scratched from the

Panther lineup due to a minor knee

injury.

“I stretched some of the knee
ligaments and I’ll just have to rest it,”
said Nellis. “I’ll probably be back for
Navy in a‘ week or so.”

For'the Panthers, the match was
good competition and an opportunity
for several guys to wrestle with three
starters out. “This was one of those
matches where we really didn’t have
super intensity,” remarked coach
Rande Stottlemyer. “I wouldn’t exactly
call it an easy match. We wrestled pret-
tv well even though we didn’t have our

seniors.”

Pitt got a win, loss and tie from the
three guys who filled in the vacant
spots. In fact, one Panther didn’t even
have to wrestle. Freshman Dan
Youngblood lost his opportunity to see
action when Ashland defaulted at 126
lbs., Mike Capozzoli was beaten at 142
lbs. and teammate Tom Alioto earned
a draw while subbing for Bond at 150
lb ' .

Next up for the Panthers will be Kent
State on the road. From past ex-
perience, Pitt will need to be sharp to
rise to the occasion in order to up their
undefeated record another notch-

“If we’re not careful, we can easily
get our lunches handed to us," said
Stottlemeyer. “Last time we went there
we didn’t do very well adn the of-

z

ﬁciating wasn’t what we thought it
would be. It’s tough to wrestle at Kent
State. You have to beat everybody up
there.” , _ ,

For the Panthers both Bond and
Hnath are expected returnees to the
starting lineup. If not, the same two
guys will most likely again take their
place.

Nellis is definitely out for the match,
so the responsibility of taking his spot
will again fall on the shoulders of
Capozzoli. For the junior from Mt.
Lebanon the opportunity won’t be
taken lightly.

“There isn’t really any added
pressure on me,” said Capozzoli. “Just
knowing that I have big shoes to fill is
enough, but I have to go after what I
have to do for me.”

The biggest adjustment for Capoz- V 

zoli is not pressure,.but something that
is just as familiar to any collegiate

wrestler, weight loss. Capozzoli is nor- -,

mally a 142-pounder, but is sucking the

weight to compete at 134 lbs.

“Capo is really tough, especially if
he can adjust to, the weight,”._said
Nellis. A ‘

Last Saturday the Lady Panthers
basketball team narrowly escaped
defeat in a 57-53 conference win
over the UCONN Huskies at Hart-
ford, Conneticut.

In the Big East basketball con-
ference, winning on the road is dif-
ficult, especially when your team
doesn’t play extremely well. Just _
ask head coach Kirk Bruce: “We
didn't play all that great against
Conn., but we took smart shots at
the end of the game and we made
our free throws. That was the dif-
ference in the game. We did the
things we had to do at the end of

‘the ballgame to win.” -
The victory snapped a three-

winning track at Connecticut

game losing streak for Pitt and im-
proved their record to 7-7 overall
and 3-4 in the league. UCONN
dropped to 9-8 and 1-6 in Big East
play.

The Lady Panthers were led in
scoring by guard Kim Gannis with
15 points and forward Sally Sheerer
with 12. Point guard Kim Tirik
played a fine all-around game. She
scored nine points, pulled down
seven rebounds and dished out nine
assists. _

The Huskies were led by guard
Tammi Sweet with 17 points, while‘
center Peggy Walsh had 1 1 points
and 10 rebounds.

The Lady Panthers travel to
Philadelphia tonight to play the
Villanova Wildcats. The Wildcats,
pre-season Big East favorites, are
led by iunior forward Shelly Pen- .

nefather, last season’s Big East
Player of the Year.

According to Bruce, Pennefather
can’t be stopped. “ You're never
going to stop her because she does
so many things well. She's going
to score and rebound, and she is a
great passer. They have so many
other weapons that she's going to
get the ball to the open players.
You’re actually making it easier on
them as a team to try and contain
her.”

Despite Villanova’s credentials,
Bruce appears optimistic about his
team’s chances: “I think if you can
get them on a night when they’re
not shooting well and you can re-
bound the ball, then they can be
beaten. I_think we can beat this
team if we play smart.” '

Goodson unhappy on bench

When Pitt senior point guard Joey
David went down early in the Pitt-
Duquesne basketball game on Monday
night, freshman Mike Goodson ex-
pected to see action, but played only
sparingly. Fellow freshman Jerome
Lane played at the point and dished out

“You can’t play everybody,” Chip-
man said following the Duquesne
game. “You can go down through and
ﬁnd guys on every team that do not
play a lot. Mike is a freshman, and he
is just going to have to wait [for] his
time. When his time comes, he will be

seven assists, much to Goodson’s

I displeasure.

“When David went out it was my
chance,” Goodson said following the
game. “They keep telling me I'm play-
ing behind David. What happened? I
can play ball!”

Goodson, from Elizabeth, N.J.,
sprained an ankle early in the season
and has seen limited action. Pitt head
coach Roy Chipman will start Lane at
point tonight when the Panthers host
Boston College at the field house.

playing.” Chipman added, “I guess
I'm saying that I do not know who to
play him in front of right now.”

Looking at the Pitt-Duquesne game
that was played on Monday night, it is
obvious that the rivalry is not as intense
as it was when the Panthers played in
the Eastern 8. With four of the ﬁve Pitt
starters from out of state, playing Du-
quesne means perhaps as much as play-
ing St. Francis nowadays.

“Our players do not want to walk
around with the albatross around their

neck that they lost to Duquesne,”
Chipman said after the game. “Beyond
that, the game itself is not as mean-
ingful as it was when we played in the
Eastern 8. It doesn’t do anything to our
league standing, it doesn’t do anything
to their league standing. From that
standpoint, it is not important.”

Chipman thought that the game
should be played early in the season in-
stead of during league play.

“I would like to see the game played
at a little bit different time than this,"
Chipman said. “It is very difficult to
play a game Saturday, come in and play
Duquesne tonight, then play Boston

-College on Wednesday. The game

should continue to be played, but it
shouldbe played earlier in the year.”

Despite the 95-76 win on Monday
night, Pitt still trails in the series,
28-26.

McRae, relay team
qualify for NCAA’s

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

This past Saturday, Jan. 18, Lee
McRae and Pitt’s two-mile relay team
travelled to East Tennessee Universi-
ty with the hopes of qualifying for the
National Championships, and that is
exactly what they did. McRae won the
60-yard dash with a time of 6.09
seconds which not only qualified him
for the nationals but it might also be
the fastest indoor. time for the 60 so far
in the 85-86 season. In addition to this,
the two-mile relay team is now one of
only three teams throughout the-coun-
try to have qualified for the nationals.
They placed second innthe meet by be-
ing out—leaned at the finish by Florida
State. They had an overall time of
7:26.3 with Joe Daniels running a
1255.4, Bob Weiner a 1251.8, Dave
Moore a 1259.7, and Tim Manes a
l:49.4, all combining to make for a na-
tional qualiﬁer.

Head coach John Vasvary was
delighted with the idea of having ac-
complished all they had set out to do
at East Tennessee. “I was really
pleased with the two-mile relay, and

' Lee’s time was really phenomenal —

it was only .07 seconds off the world
record,” Vasvary said. The added
bonus of already having qualiﬁed for
the nationals this early in the seasonis
that now the team can settle down and
begin to concentrate on the conference
championships instead of continually
trying to find a place that will allow
them the competition to achieve na-
tional status.

The members of the men’s team that
did not attend the Kodak Invitational
in East Tennessee stayed home at Fitz-
gerald Field House and hosted the Pitt
Invitational. The competition in this
meet was not as tough as in previous
meets, but there was still some good
performances turned in by the athletes
involved.

In the 50-meter dash Vernon Reed
placed first as well as a host of other
Pitt athletes who won their events. Ken
Picciano won the mile, Jesse Mikell
won the 500-meter run, Thomas Bog-
gan won the 800-yard run, Tony
Brookover won the 1000-meter run,
Burt Grossman won the shot put, Al
Tunson won the long jump, and Pitt
won the mile relay.

“It was not a real strong field and
really broke down to a competition
among ourselves," Vasvary noted of
the meet.

Not only were the men in action this
weekend, but so too were the women.
On Friday they travelled to Ann Arbor,
Mich., to attend the Michigan Relays.
All in all they came away with some
great performances, and even some
records.

The 4X60-meter shuttle hurdle relay
of Lynn Pike, Donna Collins, Luanne
Harris and Debbie Bonner, set a meet
and a school record with a time of~35.9
seconds in addition to winning the race.
While the mile relay of Pat Cupid,

_Renee Henderson, Sue Torrey and

Gloria Azeke were able to complete the
race first in a time of 3258.7 and the
two-mile relay team of Sue Torrey,
Amy Difrancesco, Hannah Russell and
Gloria Azeke placed third with a time
of9: 14.7 which qualified them for the
Easterns and established a new school
record. '

In addition there were some out-
standing individual performers. Lynn
Pike placed third in the 60-yard
hurdles, Donna Colliers placed second
in’ the 60-yard hurdles and Angie
Fowlkes placed second in the 60-yard
dash.

The women’s head coach Steve
Lewis was very pleased with the show-
ing his team made at the meet. “I _think
the women are getting ready to come
into their own, experience has been our
biggest obstacle, and after four meets
it is becoming less and less of an ef-
fect," Lewis surmised.

The Sporting Life
Little League kills winter doldrums

 

I was looking at winter on the other
side of my window yesterday and get-
ting awfully depressed. The snow was
turning gray in uneven piles along Fifth
Avenue and everyone was wearing
heavy coats and tosscl caps. And they
all had sort ofa panic—stricken look in
their eyes. The sky was a menacing
steel blueish—silver color. dark enough
so that my light had to be on. It was

_ entirely sadl

So you know what I did?

I put John Fogerty’s “Centerfield”
album on the turntable and pulled out
that old box of baseball cards I keep
under my bed. I closed the curtains, put
on my Yankee cap and played with the
cards for two hours. (Yeah, I know,
but midterms aren’t for another month
so what the heck.)

It was beautiful. Winter vanished
behind the curtain and I swear I could
smell grass on some of the cards.

At some point during my reverie my
mind drifted back across the changing

__ seasons of so many years and I found
myself thinking about a springtime lost

somewhere in the mid—1970s. It was the
spring I played Little League baseball.

I played on a team called the Pirates
in a league that consisted of a total of
three teams. The Reds and the Dodgers
were the other teams. It was a small
league, but we were small kids.
Besides, you knew you never had to
worry about long road trips in that
league. We were the USFL of little
leagues. Nobody respected us. Nobody
should have.

Our games were played on a ﬁeld
that was mostly dirt and weeds and
lined not by chalk, but by a row of pine
trees along the foul lines. There were
no automatic homeruns in that park,
but if you put the ball into the
overgrown field behind the center

fielder, it was a good bet you had a
round—tripper. Especially if the out-
fielder lost the ball in the tall grass. It
was an art hitting the ball into the tall
grass. We used to practice it. I can't
remember if the field had a name. but
there was a creek running behind home
plate.

Sure. the place may not have been
the Astrodome, but playing in the creek
before the games was fun.

There was one thing I hated about
that league. It wasn’t the ﬁeld, and it
wasn’t the small size of the league, but
the fact that we didn’t get uniforms. My
friends in other leagues had them. Nice
ones, too. They had button down

jerseys and fancy looking caps, some

teams in other leagues even had stock-
ings. But not us. No sirree. Our coach
thought we had sense enough to figure
out who our teammates were without
benefit of an identifying uniform. Our
coach overestimated us.

I couldn’t count the times we threw

the ball at baserunners instead of our
fielders. Needless to say we weren’t the
most liked team in the league.

My Pirate career lasted only about
three weeks. The league folded mid-
way through its first and only season.
But in that brief period of time I was
able to lead the team in no fewer than
two categories — walks and errors. At
the plate my strategy was simple. I was
already the shortest kid on the team and
when I crouched over the plate I left
the pitcher with virtually no strike
zone. I’d wait for the fourth pitch and
casually jog to first base. After seven
games, I was listed as having three of-
ﬁcial at bats.

Shortest kid on the team, right? So
where did I play? First base naturally!
The only position on the ﬁeld where

NFL Roundup
Dr. D’s 1985 All—Shmo team

At the end of every football season,
a list of the year‘s best NFL performers
is drawn up by almost every major
media source in the country. This
somewhat predictable roster is refer-
red to as an All—Pro team. Names like
Marcus Allen, Dan Fouts, James Lof-
ton and Lawrence Taylor are practical-
ly pencilled in before the first kickoff
in September, therefore taking the
mystery and diversity out of an already
boring and sometimes biased media
ritual. Although the players mention-
ed above, along with the other
thoroughbreds who make the All—Pro
team fully deserve this distinction, they
are the only gridders who receive any
year-end publicity for their efforts.
This week’s column is dedicated to
honoring the year’s worst performers,
those who fully displayed their stillborn
ability to founder and falter, to take it
on the chin during the crucial and not-
so—crucial moments of the game.
Fellas, this dud’s for you.

Dr. D’s All—Shmo Team
Quarterback — Vince Ferragamo,
Buffalo-Green Bay.

Ferragamo heated up the cold Buf-
falo area with 5 TD passes and 17 in-
terceptions and ended the 1985 season
with a 50.8 rating. Head coach Hank
Bullough was so impressed that he sent
01’ Vince packing to Green Bay to sit
the bench behind three other All—Shmo
candidates. Lynn Dickey, Randy
Wright and forlorn Jim Zorn.

Running Backs — Earl Campbell,
New Orleans and Walter Abercrom-
bie, Pittsburgh.

Campbell is slow and beaten like a
drum. His days of running through big
defensive players are quite over. It’s
a shame that this one-time superstar has
fallen to earth so quietly. The languid

it’s imperative to have good reach and
they throw me there. I like to think they
picked me to play first because I had
outstanding hands and lightning quick
reﬂexes. Actually I was picked because
I was the only kid on the team with a
first baseman‘s mitt.

There is one moment in my baseball
career that I am more proud of than any
other. We were playing the Reds and
getting pounded by them as usual. It
was late in the game and the Reds had
a runner on first. I think her name was
Lisa. The pitcher, catcher, second
baseman and I were having a meeting

"on the mound — I’d secretly always

wanted to be in one of those — and I
got the idea to give the ball to the sec-
ond baseman and I would try to talk
Lisa into stealing. When she got there
—WHAM the ball would be waiting
for her.

We all jogged back to our positions.

"You know you ought to steal,” I
told Lisa.

“I’m not very fast," she answered, ,
eyeing me warily. I was, after all. the
enemy, and not to be trusted in any
circumstance.

“The catcher don’t have an arm,”

Iorodded.
“I don’t know.”
“What, are you afraid or

something?” That did it. With the in-
spiration of not being chicken burning
inside her, Lisa took off like a shot
towards second. But the ball was
waiting. Our second baseman-deftly
made the tag and ended the inning. It
was our best play all year. I wonder if
it was an accident that when she came
off the ﬁeld, Lisa spit on my shoes.

It was a tough league. But it had its
moments. How many more days of
winter are there anyway?

be sacked a whopping 62 times. Salem
didn’t move anyone off the line all
season.

Guards — Steve Courson, Tampa
Bay and Dan Alexander, New York
Jets.

Courson may be seeking employ-
ment in the near future with his mild
contribution to the already stagnate
Bucs offense. Alexander is letting age
catch up to him in a race he ean’t win.

Tight End — Benny Cunningham,
Pittsburgh.

Slow, slow, slow. Decent blocker,
but the downfield speed and pass-
catching ability of this lubber leave
something to be desired.

Center —
Philadelphia.

Lacks overall quickness, but is slow-
ly improving his game. Maybe by 1988

Mark Dennard,

Wide Receivers — Calvin Muham-
mad, Washington and Clyde Dun-
can, St. Louis.

Early in the season Muhammad

couldn’t even catch a D.C. cab; then
he was benched in favor of ex—USFL
speedster Gary Clark. Hotshot Duncan
held out for millions, signed late, then
came into St. Louis and caught four
passes in two years.
Defensive Lineman — Kim
Bokamper of Miami, Keith Ferguson
of San Diego, and Daryl Sims of
Pittsburgh.

All three are poor pass rushers and
extremely weak against the run,
especially Bokamper. Ferguson had an
awful year and may retire soon. Sims
was erroneously ‘a candidate for the
Bust of the Year Award, which pre-
dictably went to Dolly Parton for the
10th consecutive time.

Linebackers — Woody Lowe and
Linden King of San Diego, Robin
Sendlein of Miami, and Calvin
Daniels of Kansas City.

All need work in every aspect. Lowe
should have headed out with ﬁred
Charger defensive coordinator Tom

Bass. Ever hear. of Sendlein and
Daniels before‘?

Safeties — Rick Woods, Pittsburgh
and Ivory Sully, Tampa Bay

The two combined their talents in
recording a charity record for op-
pressed defensive backs called “Burn
City.” Woods gets picked on every
game, while Sully was invisible in the
Buccaneer defensive backfield this
season.

Cornerbacks — Keith Bostic,
Houston and Gill Byrd, San Diego.

Both are terribly fast, and that's
about it. Weak covermen in a crucial
one—on—one position.

Kicker — Eric Schubert, New York

. Giants.

The ex—Pitt Panther started out like
a house on fire, then neatly self-
destructed at the end of the season.
especially in the playoffs, where he
missed six of his last seven attempts.

thers lost two close meets to LaSalIe
and Penn ‘State, there was still some
good to come out of it.

One of the high points for the Pan-
thers was the diving. Against LaSalle.
Pitt dominated the boards as senior
Todd Mulzet won both one—meter
(314.37) and three—meter (361.27).
Junior Jack Shuten finished second on
three-meter (316.50) and third on one-
meter (285.67) while sophomore Chris
Blair took‘ third on three—meter
(315.50). In addition, all of the Pan-
ther’s divers scored over 300 points on
the three—meter board since senior
Mike McCalley had 302.55 and
freshman Vernon Yenick had 300.75.

“I’m very happy with how they are
doing,” said diving coach Julian Krug.
“Overall they are performing outstand-
ingly. The fact that all of them scored
over 300 in three—meter is great.”

Also against LaSalle, Mulzet
qualified for the NCAA Diving Pre-
qualifications in both one— and three-
meter while Shuten and Blair both
qualiﬁed on three-meter.

In the meet against the Nittany Lions,
Mulzet won one-meter (312.00) and
ﬁnished third on three—meter (331.80).
Shuten won three-meter (360.90),
while McCalley, who has not competed
in five months because of injuries,
finished second on three—meter
(333.75) qualifying him for NCAA

meter (301.50) and Yenick finished
fourth (296.55), both qualifying for
pre-quals.

Another ray of sunshine for the Pan-
thers has been the performance of
' Donald Martin. In both of the Panthers
meets, Martin won the 200-yard breast
stroke with a time of 2:07.85 against
Penn State and 2208.03 against LaSal1e.

The meets were both tight ones for
the Panthers. They lost to LaSalle
60-53, and it came down to the wire
as Pitt lost a 61-92 decision to the Nit-
tany Lions, the first time they defeated

The old saying that there is a silver
lining in every cloud certainly held true
for Pitt’s men‘s swim team last
weekend. Despite the fact that the Pan-

The Pitt News. January 22. 1986

Penn State dunks Panthers

The Pitt swimmers. lost to arch-rival Penn State.

Pitt since 1971.
“I hate losing both so close,” said
head coach Fred Lewis. “Against

LaSalle, we lost the medley relay by _

only 0.3 of a second. Against Penn
State we lost the 50-yard freestyle by
0.01 of a second.

“The guys on the team are swim-
ming their lifetime bests unshaved.
Tom Shaulinski had his best meet ever
against Penn State. Rick James had his
season best times in the 200 individual
medley and backstroke. Over the two
meets, in nine out of 13 events we
recorded team best times.” .

But, regardless of some top—notch
swimming, the Panthers were not able
to come out on top.

“LaSal1e has a lot of good individual

swimmers,” Lewis said. “They did
not make any mistakes the entire meet.
Penn State overwhelmed us with the

depth on their team. They had a.

tremendous recruiting class and had 24
new swimmers this year.”

Things are not going to get any easier
for. the Panthers as they travel to West

Chaz PalIa/ The Pitt News

Virginia this weekend. The Moun- I

taineers are 7-3 and defeated LaSalle
62-51 earlier this season.

“In eight of 11 events West Virginia
has posted faster times than us
shaved,” Lewis commented. “Wejust
have to keep pointing toward the Big
East and hope we don’t have to take
too many more lumps along the way.
We just have to keep swimming fast
and improving.”

 

Students detour around construction as, Thackeray Hall is rennovared.
