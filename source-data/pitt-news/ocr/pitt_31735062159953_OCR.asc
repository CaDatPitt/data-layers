THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

FRI., NOV. 530, 1951

(Meet the Legislators

The Comons Room today
will be the scene of an open
meeting of Student Congress.

At 1:30 p.m. the student leg-
islators will assemble and run

through a regular agenda be-

fore‘ the student body as well
as answering questions from stu-
dents.

Besides the regular agenda, the
meeting will include several spe-
cial corrflnittee reports. The Poll-
ing Committee report to be given
by Chairman Dan Berger is ex-
pected to be one of the highlights
of the program. Other special re-
ports will include Pitt Chest,
Dad’s Day, -and Faculty Ratings
Committee.

Preceding this part of the Stu-
dent Government Clinic’s pro-
gram, at 10:30 a.m. today, a panel
discussion was held in the Social

Room of Stephen Foster Memorial. _

Students were permitted to direct
questions to the dean of men, dean
of women, and student presidents
of WSGA, Men’s Council, and Stu-
dent Congress.

Congress President Cyril Wecht
said Wednesday that his talk
would include these points: .

91. Student leadership can be

u . ‘. an active force in the over-
all administration set-up.

,2. The University should con-

tinually recognize student re-

sponsibility in different aspects, _

of campus life.

3. The students must first show
their willingness and ability to
assume responsibility.

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men, stated his belief in the neces-

. sity for student leadership say-
wing, “You just can’t have satisfac-

t o r y university administration
without effective student expres-
sion.” _

Dean of Women Helen P. Rush,
expressing her belief that student
leadership and the administration
shouldinot be at loggerheads, said
that «as an administrator she
‘‘would rather make a contribu-
tion 'to their (student leaders)
thinking than use power.”

Referring to the current SC poll,
Dean Rush explained that count-
ing noses was not the proper
method for student leadership to
approach the administration and
was an attempt on their partito
use “power.” "

SUGGESTIONS—Marilyn Kublanow and Jim Henry deposit their
ballots in’ the Student Congress suggestion box on the ground ﬂoor.
The purpose of these boxes is to discover student feelings to-
ward a proposed‘ second newspaper, women cheerleaders, and

faculty rating.

PLAYERS ADVISED

Cast and crew members of
“Oedipus Rex” and other
members of P it t Players
should pick up chits today
from 2 to 4:30 p.m. in 1309 C1.

C&G Prospects
Meet Today

A meeting of all students inter-
ested in re-organizing the defunct
Cap and Gownclub’ will be held
this afternoon at 4:30 in 832 C1.

The Cap and Gown club for
men formerly put on annual re-
vues for over thirty years until
World War II knocked it off cam-
pus. It was revived in 1946 and
shows were put on in 1946 and
1947.

  SC Polls ‘Yes, Girl §heer|__e___aders'

Says ‘No’ to Second

Campus Newspaper

By DAVE WINTER.
Results of the Student Congress poll made public to-

—day showed student opinion saying “yes” to a faculty. rat-

ing plan, “no” to a second newspaper, and an overwhelming

“yes” to Women cheerleaders.
The poll ﬁndings will be

open to all students, in the Commons Room this afternoon.

at 1:30 p.m.

The sampling experiment cov-
ered 609 men, a little over 10 per
cent of the 5434 day school under-
grads, and 157, approximately nine
per cent, of the 2120 undergradu-
ate day school.women students.

Favorable reaction to the fac-
ulty rating plan and its probable
value to the teachers was over-
whelming, but students were split
almost evenly on whether ratings
would be biased.

The tabulations showed:

In Favor of Rating Faculty

Yes No No Opinion
Men 487 96 21
Women 132 — 18 6
Bias Possible?

Ratings Helpful to Faculty?

Yes No N 0 Opinion
Men 437 105 52
Women 120 22 10

Thirty-ﬁve per cent of the stu-
dents polled answered “yes” to
“Do you believe that there is a
need for another school newspaper
to present an editorial viewpoint
different from the Pitt News?”

Stokowskij Conducts

Here at His

Request

Leopold Stokowski, world-famous conductor, will direct

a concert of 16th century a cappella music Saturday night”

in the Heinz Chapel.

The renowned maestro, ina letter to Chancellor Fitz-

gerald requested permission to use
the Heinz Chapel. During a visit
here last year he was impressed
by its beauty and historic design.

Space limitations will limit the
audience to 4150 for performance.
Only those with invitations will be
admitted.

Letter Excerpts

On the invitations are excerpts
from the letter’by Mr. Stokowski:

X -m y Unit Here Monday. for Tests

Pitt evening students will have a chance to get free
chest X—Rays next week, according to Dr. H. C. Carlson,
head of the Men’s Health Service.

To assure every Pitt student an opportunity to take the

tuberculosis tests, the hours that%

the mobile unit will be at Pitt have
been changed.

On Monday and Tuesday the
unit will be open from 2 to 10
p.m., and on Wednesday and
Thursday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The unit will be set up on the
ground floor near the Student
Desk.

The tests will be given by” the
Pittsburgh Department of Public
Health, in co-operation with the
TB League of Pittsburgh. It will
be operated by city technicians.

12 Second Test

Er Carlson, who .madear:range- 1

that the test only takes twelve
seconds.

“TB is a fatal disease,” Doctor
Carlson emphasized, “but it can be
cured if noticed in time.” He told
of an incident that happened in
1937 when a similar test was given
at Pitt.

“A Pitt freshman took the test
in‘ the spring, and it was discov-
ered that he had a mild case of the
disease. At the end of the sum-
mer, he was able to return to
school, completely cured.

Senior Too Busy

“O the other hand,’? Carlson T

he ﬁnally got around to an X—ray,
he was found to have an incurable
case. He died at the end of the
summer.” 1

Along that line, the Pittsburgh
department of public health point-
ed out that TB does not show itself
in its early stages. “Therefore,”
said a department spokesman, “a
person can have the disease, not
know, and communicate it to other
members of his family.”

Test results will be mailed to
students before Christmas vaca-
tion begins. No undressing is
necessary for the test.

Dr. Carlson added, that every
instructor at Pitt should mention
the tests inthis classland urge his
students to take the test.

in the mystical and deeply emo-
tional a cappella music of Victoria,
a_sixteenth century Spanish com-

“For years I have been studying
this music, and have played some
of it in concerts. But always I
had the feeling that the concert
hall was not the ideal atmosphere
for it, and dreamed of performing
it some day in the Spanish Ca-
thedrals and Basilicas. At last my
dream came true, and it was for
me a glorious experience.

Thought of Chapel

“When conducting in t h e s e
Gothic Cathedrals, I often thought
of the beautiful Heinz Chapel in
Pittsburgh, and that the heavenly
music of Victoria would also have
a perfect setting in this Chapel.

“I was sure music lovers of
Pittsburgh would respond sensi-
tively to its inspiration, and it
would be for them, as it has been
for me, an unforgettable mem-

Food Service,
Inspector Says ~  

The Pitt cafeteria and Tuck
Shops don’t have to worry
about their ABC’s, according
to City Health Engineer Herb-
ert J. Dunsmore. S

Explaining why the Univer-
sity eating places don’t receive

' grade stickers, Mr. Dunsmore
said, “The purpose of grading
is mostly for giving the public
a choice of restaurants. Stu-
dents at Pitt don’t have much “
of II. choice, therefore, grading
the cafeteria wouldn’t be of
much value.”

Even though the school food
shops aren’t graded, they don’t
escape six week inspections by

US Labor Department Manual
Helps Students Pick Careers

The United States Department of Labor has printed a
book called, “Occupational Outlook Handbook,” designed to
help college students, who are undecided about their major

of courses.

According to the Handbook
there is a great need for elemen-
tary school teachers, and engi-
neers are in demand because of
the current mobilization. Scient-
ists and television technicians are
also scarce.

Women interested in becoming
nurses, dieticians, librarians and
social workers will have good op-
portunities for placement.

The need for newspaper report-
ers, lawyers, and radio announc-
ers is expected to be limited in
the next years. Students who want

;a handbook may purchase one

from the Superintendent of Docu-
ments, Washington 25, D C. for
$3.

Memorial.

trial in which the freshmen will
be defending their observance of
the customs and traditions of the
University.

Dan Purdy, presiding chief jus-
tice said, “The freshmen have been
given no indication of who will re-
ceive the keys, therefore it is of
particular interest to every fresh-
man to be present.”

Herbert E. Longenecker, dean of
the graduate school, will act as
guest counselor for the defense.

He also says that no student
will be allowed to cash more than
$10 per week and that the fund
can only cash $50 each day. He
expects it to be in operation
shortly '

More Space in Lounge

Sultanov is investigating a long-
range possibility of gaining more
space on the 8th ﬂoor for the;
men’s lounge. He says, “This will
be a transition between the pres-
ent facilities and the proposed
student union.”

One idea which has already met
a stumbling block is the possi-.
bility of men students obtaining
streetcar passes. Mel Forrest re-
ports that the Pittsburgh Railways
Co. has refused to permit this be-
cause its constitution states‘ that
only students forced to attend
school may be given passes.

He says, however, that streetcar
officials indicated that the consti-
tuition may be revised in the near
future.

Two More Proposals

Two other proposals are still‘
being investigated. One is a Coun-
cil-sponsored student dance in
early February chaired by Ronald
Ecker. The other is a plan for
merchandise discounts in Pitts-

Sultanov says that the idea of
the committee “is not only to rec-
ommend projects that can be. com-
pleted immediately, but also long-
range proposals that can only be
planned this year.”

Korean Clothes Drive
Launched by YWCA

The YWCA officially launched the “Clothes for Korea”
drivetoday by passing out publicity leaﬂets to students. '

The drive is an attempt by the United Nations through
its appointed committee, American Relief for Korea, to
meet the present Korean emer-5

gency.

Chairman of the drive at Pitt is
Lita de Veyra, college junior, who
is also chairman of the YWCA
community service committee.

Clothing Boxes

Boxes for the collection of cloth-
ing have been placed at the Stu-
dent Desk and on the 8th and 12th
ﬂoors. I I

Needed ‘articles include all
outer garments, especially warm
winter clothing, and men’s white
shirts, low-heeled shoes of all
kinds for men and women, pre-
ferably in small sizes, children’s
shoes, blankets,’ bedding, and
yard goods. Clothing may be
used, but should be clean and,h1
good condition.

After the close of the drive on
Dec. 15, the AF of L and CIO will
provide trucks to transport the
clothing to the West Coast.

10 Day Delivery .

From there, airlines will ﬂy all
the collected articles to Korea, as-
suring distribution to needy indi-
viduals within ten days.

The Pitt drive is only one of
many now being carried on by
Scout troops, clubs, colleges, uni-
versities, and public schools across
the nation.

(Every man must meet his Waterloo at last. _
——Wendell Phillips.)
Thomas A.’ Perkinson, know variously as a “satirist,”
an “Ex-Pitt Editor” and a “brilliant student,” has met his
Waterloo. Most people here who have followed his post-
graduate career must regret that he did not turn his in-
tellectual powers to pursuits more beneficial to society.
There is, however, no necessary relationship between
mental capacity and community service. Mental giants in

the past have also directed their energies at objectives
' detrimental to society, although few on the piddling scale

of a Perkinson. ,
Since he doesn’t seem too unhappy about his misfor-

»tunes,.there is little reason why we should waste our time
being unhappy for him. We should remember, however,

that he did show a certain amount of affection for the old
place by staging a homecoming in one of the local hang-
outs. He showed us how an alum can go through here and

A walk offwith cash instead of getting rid of it.

The downtown‘ papers have made much of old grad
Perkinson’s career here. They seem to have sensed some-
thing highly signiﬁcant in his relationship with Pitt and

. especially his career on the Panther. He has been typed
A as a Pitt student and a humorist.

‘Perkinson, relying on the downtown papers for your

,  information, seems to have only one really big connection
’ and that is with Pitt. Here he was born,sreared, become a
L iman, developed his amazing powers of satire and humor,
learned how to “paint his gun yellow,” while he waited

; on the cops, and began his crime wave.

_ All three of the papers must have men stationed out-
side Perkinson’s cell with ‘notebooks waiting to jot down

 j his little barbs at society and his carefree quips (the kind
Q  that made him editor of the Panther). Perkinson is pro-
i 1 viding them with a lot of amusement and even more copy.

They have betrayed a singular lack of discrimination

  and a consuming disdain for the University in digging up
their angle for the Perkinson story. The writing in the

stories seems to indicatejthat he is takingthem for a ride;

 they are falling-for all of his neat poses and ﬂip phrases.

They have turned him into a three-ring circus and
given him the full treatment, a la Rita Hayworth-—-Aly
Kahn. The fact that he is a criminal seems to be minor.

Perkinson is something more than a Pitt graduate and
former Panther editor; he is a crook and a psychopathic

” one at that. He was formed mentally long before he came

here and he would have been a crook had he never come
here. ‘i ,

They have largely ignored this and spent most of
theirtime on the Pitt angle. Their handling of the story

1 has done much damage to the University’s place in the
' community. .

’ There is no reason why they could have angled the

C A. story around some other facet of the one-man-crime-wave’s

lifeand still managed to get in all of the details of his

if L life here.

Few people ndw even know what crimes he commit-
ted so absorbed have the papers been with his student

life. We should like to point out that since there are many

Pitt grads on the downtown papers, it is possible that ife

if  here may have something to do with irresponsibility and
‘ crime. ‘ H

A   ‘The won-y

  

1., umn on the sub ect. Student-Congress Men’s

Clinic‘

Dr. George W. Crane, Ph.D., MD., has achieved
a certain amount of fame as a healer through his
column, “The Worry Clinic”, which runs six_ times
a week on the comics pages of the Post=Gazette.
Dr. Crane daily applies his pyschological powers
to one worry or another of his readers and usually
comes up with a solution. ‘

The Doctor has been known to
clear up an extreme case of
schizoprenia with overtones of
an Oedipus complex in nothing
more than twelve inches. His so-
lution: “join the compliment
club.”

But the eminent pyschologist
does not restrict himself to psy-
chiatric cases exclusively. He
will tackle any difficulty from  p 
fridgidity in the bride to the intestinal d cult of
the infant, and he doesn’t hesitate to come to grips
with the more pressing ideological problems of the
day. » .

He has advised lawyers on the 1aw,,doctors on
medicine, women on men, men on women, diplo-
mats on diplomacy, instructors on instruction, and
many, many others on many, many other things.
Some of these people by now must- be a little
skeptical of’ his frequent admonition to join the

 

    

, “compliment” fraternity. _ .

Although Dr. Crane has fallen in disrepute with
his colleagues in the pyschological trade, he enjoys
high favor with his fellow worriers. They look to
hifn for an answer and he gives it to them six days
a week. What happens to them on Sunday is not
known, but possibly the churches take care of them.
He Is Branching Out

Of late Dr. Crane has branched out into the
phamplet ﬁeld. His work must be more satisfying
there for it is not so fleeting as the daily news-
paper. The pamphlet can be slipped into the-pocket
and referred to when a worry crops up.

Hist most recent phamplet is put out for the use
of morticians or, as they are popularly known, un-
dertakers. He titles it“‘Psycho1ogy Applied to Fu-
nerals.” Before we get into the meat of this little
gem of pyschological literature, it might be inter-
esting to look -at the introduction. '

Dr. Crane is held to be “one of the outstanding

‘CR (R)‘eva|uiion  

Despite the gag rules of a tradition which
has bound it in idleness too long, the Com-
mons Room is struggling towards maturity.

Even in the ‘relatively short time I have
attended Pitt—four years—I have watched
its evolution from a great expanse of wasted
space into a warm center of
activities.

But this was not always
so, for change came slowly
to the big stone vault in the
heart of the Cathedral.

Let’s take a look back a
few years and see how the
Commons Room used to be
In its own small campus
bound way this shows wha  ,
happens when the people if
want something and cold, ‘senseless tradi-
tion stands in their way.

We’ll dip back to 1945 ﬁrst———a time when

     
     
   
  

the Commons Room languished in its youth.‘

It was dark then, so badly lighted that you
could not read a newspaper in some corners.
Some long-forgotten Pitt News ‘editor
wrote on Nov; 14 of that year this little gem:
“A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING:
Members of the Commons Room Coun-
cil have called to the attention of your
editor the fact that many students are
using the Commons Room as a place for
study. It is the desire of the Council
that such practice be refrained from,‘ as
the Commons Room is not a study room,
but a place where students may meet
their friends and gather around the
1 tables for informal conversations . . .
Those who do remain in the Commons
‘Room, however, should remember the
stately atmosphere and conduct them-
selves in good taste accordingly.”

Things didn’t change for the better until
1948. Late that spring the University ﬁnally
put decent lighting into the Commons Room.
Wattage in each of the overhead lights was
increased from a gloomy 500 to a warm 1450
and the room became liveable.

Real Clamar Starts 

It was last year that the Commons Room
probably reached adolescence.

That was when a real clamor started
to put the vast space in the room to good

use——in this case a dance. Pitt News Editor »

pyschologists in America today.” He has five do-1

greerarid a textbook which is in use in over 308 4
colleges‘ and universities; he is one of the highest ,-

priced public speakers in America, a point which
should be of reassurance to the relatives of a do-
parted loved one. "
The phamplet, taken from a radio address, “has
done much to counterbalance the recent derogatory
articles on funeral service presented in the past
year by a horde of irresponsible, uninformed

» writers.” Seems that someone was taking pot shots

at the undertakers about their services.

V Dan‘! Worry About Death

Dr. Crane starts off with a remarkable side-
ment: “Many people are still afraid of -death 8111
some young folks get quite panicky at the vi.‘-y
thoughtof funerals.” He seems to be 
that we have become stoic about death and that
perhaps there is something unnatural or worse, Q-
American, about being afraid of death.

He goes on “but this is a wrong point of view.
For death is really the graduation ceremony at’
which We are promoted from this school room on“
the planet Earth.” But there are probably many
people who aren’t sure whether it is a graduation
or a demotion.‘ Dr. Crane doesn’t clear up this angle.

He goes on to disagree with a certain group in
our society who would like to strip funerals of the

ceremony, the ﬂowers and the services. Keeping to _

his comparison of a graduation ceremony, Dr. 7
Crane shows how unimpressive it would be with-.
out all of the pomp and circumstance. ’ ‘

He becomes a little perturbed at the proponents
of cremation, They would completely destroy
“graduation” and, incidently, create an economic
disturbance in the casket making industry and the
undertaker’s trade. These heretics are cdmpared
with the Nazis “who could ‘dump the bodies in a. A
trench and quickly cover them with the aid of 8‘.
bulldozer.” »

Dr. Crane advises his readers in,the ministerial

. group to make the most evangelically of the funeral L
service. He says “mine this vein of gold, for soon —

the duties of the old world will again descend on
that -audience.” He doesn’t have to advise the un-
dertakers, they are mining it. 1

took it on from there.
Administrative opposition,’ especially from

the-dean of women’s ofﬁce, rang loud and,’

ﬁrm in return. It was duly said many times
that such a thing had never beenv-done be-
fore, that the tradition of the Commons
Room ruled such an upstart project out.
And in more ﬂowery language the stu-
dents in essence dully returned peppery sal-
vos of “So what?” ‘
6 In the end the “so what’s?” won out.
The guardians of Commons Room sanctity
justly yielded to student pressure and the

ﬁrst dance was held. It was not a ﬁnancial, , '
success, but it was a start. It opened a crack .

in the wall of tradition. The wall began ,to
crumble. * T
Just this semester the Commons Room
ﬁguratively grew its ﬁrst whiskers. That
was when students trooped under its "arches

to celebrate the win over West Virginia with .

a giant victory rally. We found another good
use for the Commons Room and not a speck
or a molecule of its beauty was marred.
Lang Pants Due T '.
The Commons Room should put on its ﬁrst .

honest-to—goodness long pants on Dec.,14,

the night of the ﬁrst Christmas dance there.

By then it should have reached its maturi- -

ty and be able to coast along into imiddlae
age, leading a useful and fruitful life.

If you desire to do so, you can take all _

this as an object lesson in democracy. Or
you can take it as the ﬁrst throbbings of a
campus life and spirit at _Pitt. ,. .
Personally, though, I believe it isjust
one chain of incidents in the long surge
here and elsewhere of student leader-
ship by students. At Pitt—as in most
other colleges-—students and their govg .
erning bodies have little real power in
determining how four years of their ‘
life is going to be run; A 4
At Pitt the maturing of the Com-
. mons Room is a good indication of things
to come. Let’s not lose it. 1

‘  Miami Last Showing for 11 Seniors

BY DON SCHURMAN
With four years of a well-rounded gridiron education
behind them, 11 Pitt seniors make their collegiate bow-outs

against Miami on Friday, Dec.

7.

During their stay at Pitt, the 11
veterans—-eight of whom are reg-
ulars-—have performed under both
the single wing and the T, while
working under a different coach
each year.

As freshmen, they operated with
the single wing under Ted
Schmidt, and then again as soph-,
omores under Mike Milligan. Last
year Len Casanova tutored them
on the ﬁrst T—team in Pitt history,
while this year Tom Hamilton is
their pilot.

By BOB MCCARTHY
The Oakland football championship will be resumed

today after a one year lapse, when the Psi Omegas of Pitt
face Carnegie Tech’s Delta Tau Delta at the Stadium. Kickoff

time is 4 p.m.

The Psi O’s earned the right to
meet the Skibo entry by lacing
the undefeated Castoffs, 20-6, for
the intramural crown, Wednesday.
The win marked the third straight
year that the Psi O’s have copped
the IM plaque. It also is the third
consecutive year that the dental
fraternity has won the profession-
al league title.

29-Game Winning Skein

Today the Psi Omegas will be
protecting a 29-game winning
streak, the longest in Pitt intra-
mural football history. This streak
includes victories over such rug-
ged opponents as the 1949 PiKA,
IF champs, the 1950 Delta Tau

powerful runnerups, the Castoﬁs.

. Bemis Does Fine Job

Heading the IM organization is
A one of the friendliest, most co-
operative guys in the University
in Leo.C. Bemis. Nothing seems
i to bother Bemis, and when you
have 458 teams to make schedules
for, it’s bound to tax the mental
power of any man.

But Bemis after ﬁve years is
still going strong. In fact this
year he has had a problem ﬁnd-
ing referees to ofﬁciate the IM
contests, resulting in his ap-
pearances on the scene as an
official. “I really hate to do it
since it isn’t policy, but I enjoy
it,” says Bemis.

Bemis has had more problems
than a woman with ten children.

cessitating the use of the Stadium
for basketball.

But Bemis took it in stride. And
with time taking its course the IM
touch football season ended in

Bemis’ chief problem now is
mapping a. schedule for 84 has-
ketball sguads which are slated
for IM action this winter. This
number is also the largest in IM‘
basketball history at Pitt.

A Job Well Done

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton
feels that Bemis has done a ﬁne
job with the IM program this year
and he feels that the use of the

the problem of facilities.

“I’m glad to see the ﬁnal
championships end. I'm sorry
that I could‘ not attend the ﬁnals
this year. Leo Bemis has done
a terriﬁc job,”, says ' Hamilton,

Jacki Strain Adds Preaching,
Selling to 20-Credit Load

   

By ELINORE STONE

There’s a true “J_ack-of-all-
trades” here at Pitt. He_ 1S
Rev. John G. Strain, alias
Jack Strain.

A senior in the College,
Jack’s “trades” are many and
varied. First and foremost,

he’s an ex-baker, an insurance
salesman, a sociology major with
a 20-credit schedule, a Pitt Band
member and the father of three
children.
In Salvation Army School
At the age of 21, Jack entered

Training College. Under their
program, he studied one year in
the school and four additional
years _t h r o u g h correspondence
courses.

=In the meantime, he preached
and did social work in Salvation
Army units throughout the East.

Commissioned from the Salva-
tion Army College with the title
of Adjutant, Jack had all the rights

and privileges of a minister under '

their standards.
Regular Duties

He could preach, perform mar-
riages and baptisms and so on,
just as a regular minister.

The following 12 years he spent
as an officer of the Salvation Army
in and around New York, Phila-
delphia, and Pittsburgh.

In 1946, Jack left the Salvation

Army and opened a baking estab-
lishment in Johnstown, Pa.
managed this business until ’48,
when, on the basis of his past ex-

Nine o’clock service each Sun-
day ﬁnds Jack in either the Penn
or Harrison Church.

For the 1l.o’clock and evening

The Kentucky Kernel, student
operated newspaper at the Univer-
sity of Kentucky, has given the
University a $400,000 bonanza—a
new j o u r n a l i s m-publications
building recently dedicated.

Half of the cost of the building
came from Kernel proﬁts over the
years. Revenue bonds covering the
remainder of the cost are to be re-
tired from future earnings of the
paper. .

Professor Robert X. Graham,
head of Pitt’s journalism depart-
ment, termed a similar project
“not an impossibility” at Pitt.

Professor Graham commented
that a daily paper at Pitt coupled
with more cooperation from ad-
vertisers could bring similar re-
sults.

The Kentucky paper’s achieve-
ment represents a dream come
true for student and faculty back-
ers of the Kernel. For the first
time in University history at Ken-
