Big Projects
.Face Council

To Sound Student Opinion
On Health Service

 

 

After passing through a period
of inactivity, Student Council will
be confronted with a maze of leg-
islation during the next few weeks,
if pending events on the campus
are completed.

Probably foremost among the
measures to be considered by the
student government body is the
proposed plan for expansion of the
student health service. A lengthy
and exhaustive report of the Inves-
tigations Committee of Council,
based on an examination into pres-
ent facilities offered or the care of
student health was adopted by
council last week.

A m o n g the recommendations
made by the Investigations Commit-
tee, headed by Reed Rose, Dent. '33
whose provisions to place the finan-
cial burden of an adequate student
health -service upon each student
by the payment of a special health
service fee, in addition to- the regu-
lar University tuition; establish-
ment of a centrally located student
Health Service Bureau in the Ca-
thedral of Learning; and employ-
ment of a medical staff sufficiently
large to care for the demands of
the entire student body. '

Council is expected to sound out
student opinion on these sugges-
tions_ and in a formal report will
lay the entire matter before Chan-
cellor John G. Bowman. University
officia.l_s, although declining to com-
ment on the proposal of council, in-
dicated their interest in investigat-
ing the advisibility of adopting the
program advanced by the campus
sol-ons. ,

Other business to come before
Council at an‘ early meeting will
consist of finding the ways and
*‘fne.‘ans to finance the annual Spring

and Albert Randolph.

Cap and Gown
Tryouts Soon

Rehearsals Start Next
Week; Marlatt Director

 

“The Silver Domino” is the name
selected for this year’s Silver anni-
versary edition of Cap and Gown.

Production activity on the show
will begin with the arrival of Di-
rector William Marlatt on March 1.
Marlatt_ who is coming here imme-
diately following the production of
a. play in New York, has bought up
the costumes of two New York mu-
sical comedies which recently fin-
ished their runs.

The smoker which is usually
scheduled to open Cap and Gown

activity has not been eliminated
this year, but merely postponed, ac-
cording to Walter Rome, graduate
managerof student activities. It
will be held later for only those
who have been selected for the
show and will be of an entertain-
ing and social nature. '
Reis, Fushan Co-Authors

The book for the show, written by

G. Norman Reis and Louis M. Fu-

shan, has a student cruise—a,rouncl-

the world theme. The story allows
for varied and elaborate settings,
Each scene will be laid in a differ-
ent land save those that are laid
on the yacht. The Oriental scenes
especially will call for exotically
colored costumes and sets. This
year’s book will require a. cast of
some fifteen or twenty leads and
two choruses of approximately
twenty-four “girls” and men. The
story treats of an impersonation of
the heralded “Silver Masked So-
prano of the Radio,” of the imper-
sonator’s difficulty with the role,
and of the meeting with the origi-
nal soprano,———al1 carried on with
the progress of a spirited student
trip about the globe.

The music for the production will
again be in charge of Gus A.
Schnabel and Dr. Benjamin Levant,
who will contribute probably the en-
tire score, although some student
contributions are yet under consid-
eration of the production commit-
tee.

The show is scheduled to open
at a downtown theater for a week's
engagement beginning April 18.
The Civic Club of Allegheny Coun-
ty will again this year sponsor the
first night performance.

‘Next Issue Published for

Military Ball

The Pitt Panther dons the gold
and blue of the R. O. T. C. in its
nextnumber, the Military Ball is-
sue. A barrage of features will be
laid down before the usual humor
attacks Old Man Gloom. The issue
will be edited by David N. Lewis,
Col. '33.

Three members of the faculty
have aired their opinions of the
student_ body in an article which
is answered by another written by
three prominent students. The pro-
fessors have been so honest and
candid in‘ their expressions of at-
titude toward students that their
articles will be published anony-
mously. The three students have
also’ told just exactly what they
in
such a way that their articles must
be printed without by-lines.

Sports have been Winchelled by
Merry Cohen in a feature telling
of the sweethearts of some of
Pitt's athletes. He also strikes a
serious »note in writing about the
boxing team, while another story
“reveals some facts about the rifle
team. '

Cellophane belts are mentioned
in Ruth Malone’s half of “Clothes
Quarters” while Charley Goldstein
suggests color schemes for blonds
and brunettes in his.

Four more members of the fac-
ulty jgin in the ranks of those
who have appeared on the “Know
Your Profs” page. They represent
the English, German, Philosophy,
and Psychology departments.

Colonel Cullen has written an
article telling of the inner work-

ings of his favorite department,

the R. O. T. C. The military aspect
is carried out further by pictures
of the Military Ball chairman and
his queen. The‘Sino-Japanese war

Elevatd; Tests Cause
Cathedral Visitor Ban

No visitors will be allowed to
the top of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing until after March, according

' to the department of building and

grounds. This action was taken
due to extensive tests being made
on. the new elevators. These tests
will enable the elevators to ascend‘
at a maximum speed of 1400 feet
per minute.

Danger of serious injury due to
these tests has made this action
necessary. Students who have zool-
ogy classes on the eighth and
ninth floors of the Cathedral
will continue to use the elevator
assigned to them at the beginning
of the term.

Dental Rays ppears Again

 

January Issue, Delayed By Exams, Comes Out
Tuesday; Gives 64 Pages of Facts

Dental Rays, the oﬁicial publication of the Dental School.
has again appeared on the campus, containing the usual high-
lights, side glances, undercover slants, to be perused more or
less religiously by the Dents, and given the “once over” by the

campus at-large.

Because of difﬁculties which the staﬂ encountered, chieﬂy
preparation for the mid-year examinations, Dental Rays failed

to make its scheduled appearance%

during January, but protests of the
brothers brought aboutits publica-
tion in time for the noon hour re-
cess, Tuesday,

Outside of a few pages, toward
the back, devoted entirely to hu-
mor, and dental “goings on" in
the inﬁrmary and on the hill where
the pre-sophomores and pre-juniors
ﬁnd use for their time, fraternity
activities, class news where the ed-
itors try to outdo their associates,
and some pages given over to gen-
eral student activity, most of the
sixty-four pages are taken up with
articles of pertinent interest to stu-
dents, faculty members, and the
few outside subscribers, excluding
the exchange list.

Of the six articles appearing in
this issue, three haave been written
by students. Two of the latter three
are by members of the Dental Rays
staﬁ.

How Tooth Responds.

Richard W. Jones, '32, associate
editor of Dental Rays, contributes
the leading article on “Hypersen-
sitive Deniine” a state in which the
tooth responds to pain when irri-
tated locally, quieting immediately
after the removal of this irritation.
The author gives theories of this
condition from leading-dental au-
thorities, and describes ways of re-
moving the irritation with the min-
imum of pain.

F. A. Brown, also a senior, de-
scribes “The Cause and Treatment
of Dry Sockets” in his contribution.
Primarily due to the failure of the
blood to form a normal clot follow-
ing anesthesia, is produced by a
breaking down of a poorly organized
blood clot or by an infection of even
a healthy clot, because of the alveol-
us fromthe ﬂuids of the mouth.
Several treatments are mentioned
for this disease.

“Wa'linchus in Author Role.

VV. “Whitey” P. Walinchus, one
of Dr. Sutherland’s gridders of two
years -ago, entitles his article, “Dis-
eases of the Mouth,” an abstract
of the highlights of Sterling V.
Mead’s lengthy tome.

Other articles include: “Concern-
ing Physical Properties of Inlay
Casting Gold,” Harold M. Vernon,
and “Safe,” taken from the Clean-
liness Journal.

“Safe” is the story of a lowly
cake of soap, found in a public wash-
room, and the opprobrlous com-
ments on the part of fastidious peo-
ple. According to this anonymous
article, “one washes, even in such
circumstances, safely, even though
the hands must dry in the air, for
the soap is the element in the pic-

‘‘It’s‘ unusual that an urban school
should have such a, large percent-
age in activities. Ordinarily through
the‘ many commuters, and lack of
resident contact among students
very little group feeling exists,”
says Helen P. Rush, assistant to
the Dean of Women. Miss Rush

‘plans to hold separate conferences

’with the hundred and sixty-eight
girls who are not in activities, with-
out obvious reasons. It is felt that
a great number do not participate
because they have no way of mak-
ing contact, and are unfamiliar
with the kind of organization open
to them. -

The Dean of Women's oifice is a
strong advocate of campus ac-

tivities. The numerous personal
contacts necessarily engendered by
participation develop poise and so-
cial ease. It is good training for co-
operative and executive positions,
later to be held in vocational ﬁelds.

The survey was a very extensive

one covering over a period of three
weeks. Active girls were divided
into three groups: moderately ac-
tive, quite active, and very active.
The very active group includes
those who are carrying from nine
to thirteen activities points. There
are seventy-two in this group out of
the total of seven hundred and

tWe-Ht)’-six girls in the school, about
item per cent of the total.

Of the three classes, sophomore,
junior, and senior, the junior is the
most active with a percentage of
78.6. The sophomores are next,
with the seniors last.

Engineering
School Large

More than 300 students took
post-graduate work in the
School of Engineering last
year, probably giving Pitt the
largest graduate school of en-
gineering in the country, ac-
cording to Dean E. H. Hol-
brook.

In reviewing the work of the
Engineering School for the
past year, Dean Holbrook
stressed the fact that the Uni-
versity had spent nearly $20,,-
000 in developing an under-
graduate hydraulics laboratory
at Camp Hamilton, where
plenty of water is available
for experiments. The work
there is given under condi-
tions more nearly like those
met in practice than could
possibly be the case on the
campus.

Another recent accomplish-
ment of the School of En-
gineering was its success in
being placed on the approved
list of the American Institute
of Chemical Engineers, at its
annual meeting in Atlanta.
This list, according to Dean
Holbrook, is quite short and is
intended to include only those
institutions of the highest rank.‘

The School has also done
its part to alleviate the unem-
ployment situation by extend-
ing to unemployed graduates

Need ham Sees Wa rEa re

Instinctive to Mankind

Dr. James G. Needham, pro-
fessor of zoology at Cornell Uni-
versity, told seventy-ﬁve members
of the Collembola Club, last Fri-
day evening, that “ours is by na-
ture a fighting species,” in discus-
sing “War as a Biological Phe-
nomenon.”

“We really enjoy a war,” Dr.
Needham told his audience. “War
is the greatest of games, gaining
for the players the wildest ap-
plause. The flags and uniforms
appeal to the eye, the fife and
drum corps attract the ear, and
the extolling of our culture and
our right to protect our homes
stimulate the mind.”

“Man is ﬁghting animal. It
is instinctive of man to engage in
battles, to fight with sheer ani-
mal ferocity. Man fights automat-
icaily, by emotion, and without
reason.

In the hand to hand conflicts
of the past, the stronger survived
to strengthen the race. But since
we have changed our weapons and
science has made war so destruct-
ive, war will eventually destroy

Festival events, scheduled for the

The spring events have, in the
past, been financed by funds ob-
tained from the treasury of the
Senior Class, but this year's grad-
uating class has only $5.51 in its
class fund, so Council must turn to
other sources if it wishes to con-
tinue thé spring events.

Then there is the matter of the
Spring elections which always up-
set the calm of a councilm-anic

and fireworks are expected to fly

itself. In the case of modern war-
fare, especially in the last great
conﬂict, the best of the land was
either killed, or returned home in
such a.condition as to be incapa-
ble of strengthening the race.

“There seems to be a regular
circle,” said Dr. Needham. “War,
poverty, peace, prosperity, and
war again. But there is a way in
which this vicious circle can be
overcome. .With a diffussion of
knowledge has come a demand for
rationality in public behavior. Be-
cause of the progress of invention,
people are better acquainted with
each other. Better means of trans-
portation and communication are
powerful factors of peace.”

The speaker believed that the
only way to obtain peace lies in
force. “The instinct is ineradicable
and because of its power for pro-
ducing unity in a group, it is not
an unmixed evil. But measures
must be taken to restirct its mad-
ness and direct its unbounded
energies to- better ends before
peace can be made dominant,"
concluded Dr. Needham.

Personally, we have always agreed with these gentlemen, but our

But football pays in more ways than that, and the fact was

‘til'ea‘rly brought to our mind by the size of the crowd which witnessed

Football has come to be the main collegiate sport and
schools do not consider themselves athletic rivals until their
respective football teams have met in a regularly scheduled
contest. The main objective of schools which meet in all ﬁelds

And when

one of the schools fails to do so for a long period of time and
itshopes for the immediate future appear dismal, it turns its
mind to, other sports and will pack ‘any place if it knows that
its perennial conqueror in football is the underdog in an ath- .

Jock Sutherland employed his second and third stringers
'\ throughout the game with the Lions this past season and fol-
lowed this up by sending his regulars on the ﬁeld after the

‘an even greater extent and it was laying back in ‘hopes that an

“You’re not holding your rifle

Take it easy.”

These are familiar words that
5-may be heard most any afternoon
at the stadium rifle range as they
-«are uttered by Lt. Arthur E. Wil-
-son, coach of the Pitt rifle team
which has enjoyed great success
5‘during the present season. Most
ieveryone knows Lt. Wilson be-
cause of his interest and work in
‘the drilling of the Band as well as
the rifle team. Most of us_. how-
'ever, are not acquainted with the
colorful life which the lieutenant
~-has led. _

Born in Maine

 Wilson was born up in the

,. most north-eastern part of the

country, Maine to be exact. As far
.back as he can remember, he has
had a rifle in his hand hunting in
the wilds of Maine. There is not
much wonder that he is an ex-
pert shot with both rifle and pis-
tol.

, In 1915 Lt. Wilson entered the
~;Unlversity of Maine. As a fresh-
‘man he starred on the Yearling
football, baseball and track teams.

quarterback job in the days When

br or some note, and on the track

 a miler. , l

When only a sophomore at
Maine the World War broke out
and ten days after war had been
declared young Wilson enlisted in
the army. He never got over to
France, but was shipped to Pana-
ma as a member of a -Coast Artill-
ery Regiment. He remained in
Panama for one year and a half
during which time he was made
a second lieutenant. Two years
later he received a commission as
a first lieutenant in Uncle Sam’s

Army. During his career he spent

three years in Honolulu.
Coaches Teams

While in Honolulu Wilson coach-
ed football, basketball and base-
ball teams of the army post. He
turned out championship teams an-
nually, which were the pride of the
post. Besides all this, he did a
little boxing on the side. Lt. Wil-
son still takes a. great interest in
athletics, contenting himself with
rooting for all Panther teams and
the rifle team in particular. His
only active athletic endeavor is
bowling for a league team at the
P. A. A. where he is a member.
He speaks modestly of “215” hung
up in a recent contest.

Lt. Wilson lives at the Fairfax
Hotel with his wife and two child-
ren, both girls. This-is his fourth
year at Pitt and he likes it so well
that he is going to apply for his
fifth year. A

Leaders Set  
In Frat Loop

Kappa Sigma, S. A. E.’s
Pace Basketball League

 

Kappa Sigma and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon jumped into undisputed
possession of first place in their
respective sections ofjthe interfra-
ternity basketball league as the
result of games played during the
past week.

The Sigma Alphs won their
third game in a row with Phi
Gamma Delta, one of its strong-
est opponents, as the victims, 17-
13. Both teams had been tied for

first place at the commencement
of hostilities and the victory en-
abled the victors to sit pretty as
the expression among college stu-
dents goes.
Phi Kaps Dangerous

The one serious obstacle in the
path of the Sig Alphs is ‘Phi Kap-
pa. Due to the rearrangement of
the schedule following the witli-
drawal of the Kappa Nus, the Phi
Kaps did not make their debut
till last Thursday when they won
over Sigma Chi, 14-8. They follow-
ed this up with a victory over the
Phi Eps Tuesday.

The Phi Kaps and the Sig Alphs
are not scheduled to play until
March 16, the final game on the
schedule of each. This tilt is ex-
pected to decide the championship
of section B. ,

The Kappa Sigs had a narrow
escape in their game with Sigma
Alpha Mu, the latter’s attack in
the final few minutes of play
causing havoc among Kappa Sig
supporters. The final score was 19-
18.

Late Rally Falls Short

The score at the end of the first
half of this game was 5-5, all of
the winner's points being scored
on fouls. The Kappa Sigs got go-
ing in the last half but after they
had assumed a 17-10 lead, the
Sammies came to life and made it
17-14‘. Timmons dropped in a long
one to make it 19-14, and then Co-
hen and Alpern came through
with field goals in quick succes-
sion to make the score 19-18. But
thirty seconds remained for play
and the Kappa Sigs were success-
ful in controlling the ball until the
final whistle. Ganger and Alpern
starred for the Sammies, while
Timmons and Delello played best
for the Kappa Sigs.

The latter were further aided in
their bid for the championship by
Phi Delta Theta’s victory over the
the previously undefeated Delta
Tau Delta team Tuesday, 11-8.
White and O’Dell featured for the
winners while Hogan and Hartwig
played best for the losers.

The feature game next week
will be that between the Kappa
Sigs and Delta Tau Delta Thurs-
day night. The latter are the only
serious obstacle remaining in the
path of the former and a victory
for Bus Albright’s boys would
practically assure them the cham-
pionship.

The Pitt freshman swimming
team will swim an exhibition
meet tonight at the Keystone Ath-

Corr, who will be in New York
with the varsity team, George Lee
former A. M. A., diving champion
and member of the faculty of the
physical education department.

Unbeaten Pitt

,Tankers Open
Eastern Trip

Meet N. Y. U. Tonight;!
Swim Rider College
Tomorrow

 

The Pitt varsity swimmers open
a short eastern trip tonight when
they meet the New York Univer-
sity swimmers in the Gothamites'
pool. Tomorrow they meet. the
Rider College team in the “rough-

rider” pool in Trenton, New Jer-
sey.
The Pitt tankers have been un-

defeated thus far this season in ,

regularly scheduled dual meets,
and a comparison of the records
of the remaining opponents indi-
cates that Coach Cor’r‘s outfit
will remain in the unbeaten class.

Hanna Iron Man

Of the men taken on the trip,
Hanna, Carik, and Adlersberg are
pretty certain scorers. Hanna is
capable of swimming in the 100,
440, and relay ‘all in the same
evening without tiring appreciably
and although‘ he should meet plen-
ty of opposition in the 100, should
not have any trouble at all in
winning the long event.

Carik, in the dive, has been,get-
ting back into form during the
last week and is beginning to re-
gain some of the confidence which
left him temporarily after he dis-
located his elbow. Carik will also
swim in the 150 yard backstroke
as will co-captain Patton but neith-
er of the Pitt men, are conceded
much of a chance to win, inasmuch
as all of the opponent backstrok-
ers have been turning in better
time than 1 minute 50 seconds.
Hoviever, Carik showed unusual
power to win against Delaware
and may be able to spring another
surprise.

Adlersberg has not been turning
in the times of which he is capa-
ble during the practice sessions
but in every meet so far this year
he has extended himself and prov-
ed to be the most dependable free-
styler over the shorter distances
on the team. ‘ 5

Brother Act to Function

Joe and George Schmeiler should
score well, George in the breast-
stroke and dive, and Joe in the
breaststroke. For a while, at least,
it looked as though Josey were go-
ing back in his swimming, but he
has recently taken a brace and has
won the 220 yard A. M. A. breast-
stroke championship. Co-captaiii
George has been right behind Car-
ik in the dive, and recently in the
Delaware meet many spectators
thought he deserved first place in-
stead of his teammate. In the
breaststroke for the past two
weeks, George has been negotiat-
ing the 220 yard event in under 2
minutes 50 seconds.

The Pitt relay team of Hanna,
Adlersberg, Reilly, and Cogswell,
capable of doing 1:45 for the 200
is‘ likely to find things a bit too
fast in the east and may come out
second -best. The eastern teams
are especially fast in the short
freestyle events.

N. Y. U. Strong

New York University holds a
victory over Rider College in van
early season met and the Trees’
pool boys are expecting the tough-
est opposition from N. Y. U. Pitt‘
defeated Delaware with greater
ease than that displayed by Frank-
lin and Marshall, though F. and M.
is particularly strong in the back-
stroke and breaststroke events
which Pitt copped in the Dela-
ware meet. Case has had a very
unsuccessful season thus far, and
the Blue and Gold varsity tank-
men should have little difficulty
with the -Cleveland School.

The seniof‘ A. M. A. lowboard
diving championship will be held
March 9 in the Keystone A. C.,
pool with John Carik and George
Schmieler of the Pitt team enter-
ed. On the same night the senior
ﬁfty yard freestyle will also be
raced. The members of both the
varsity and freshmen relay teams
will be entered in the sprint event.

backstroke are conceded good
chances of doing this.

Irving Robbins and Chuck Schil-
decker will race in the 100 yard
breaststroke, and Bill Lewis and
Paul Stinner in the 50 yard free-
style. Billy Swazik is sure to force
Jones all the way in the back-
stroke. Fred Warren will lead the
assault on the longer events,
swimming in the 22.0.

It should be possible to fashion
at least two good relay teams from
the freshman talent and it is pos-
sible that several district swim
stars will be on hand to furnish
the yearlings additional competi.
tion.

In Meet With
Mountaineers

West Virginia Favored In
Pre-game Survey To
Top Panthers

A highly touted Panther) track
team will attempt to break the
jinx West Virginia University has
been in the past when the Pitt
spikers invade Morgantown to-
morrow afternoon for a dual in-
door meet with the Mountaineers.

Pitt has never won an indoor
meet from West Virginia, losing
last year by the , overwhelming

score of 78-28. This yeﬁ chances
are about even that the Panthers
will break the jinx and conquer
their opponents, Both squads are
large and well balanced, with
some good material and the duel
should be very close.
Shea Predicts Loss

Coach Shea gives West Virginia
a very slight edge in the pre-meet
dope. The coach expects, Pitt to
have slightly the better" of the
sprints, the high jump, the shot
put and perhaps the relays. The
distances, the broad jump, the
hurdles, and the pole vault should
go to West Virginia./ All the
events should be hotly/ contested
however, according to Shea, and
the margin of victory at the finish
will be very small for the winner.

‘In the sprints and the hurdles
only two men from each school

ris will run for Pitt in the 70 yard
dash, while Frazier and Hoblutzel
will furnish the opposition. Fraz-
ier was once played up as Olympic
material and he is still «highly re-
lgarded by observers who expect

{him to ave the advantage over
the Pit boys.

Calloway Favored

In the hurdles, Captain Russ
Calloway of West Virginia is the
probable winner. Calloway has
been an outstanding hurdler in this
district since his sophomore year
and he should have none too great
difficulty in taking his event to-
morrow. His teammate is- Our-
rence. Lewis and Simms or Thies-
sen will carry the burden for Pitt.

There will” be two relays and
Pitt seems the likely winner of
both. The Pitt team is composed
of Milligan, Harris, Keller who
did some sweet running two weeks
ago at Morgantown, and Harris.
Deems, Hoblutzel, Frazier and an
unknown runner will form the
Mountaineersl team.

In the distance events, the 880

and the mile run, Watkins,~Roy,'

Gaines, Tapp,'Mazzei, and Clise
will do the running. West Virgin-
ia’s best men are Price and Zim-
merman and they are good, better
perhaps than Pitt’s‘ runners.

Pitt Jumpers Strong

The high jump should furnish
Pitt some points. Kirkpatrick,
Lewis, Stirling, and Thiessen look
better than the best the Mountain-
eers can show. Stirling, Simms,
Thiessen and Sebastian will broad
jump for the Panthers.

McConnell and O’Dell will vault
against Simpson of West Virginia
and they seem doomed to defeat
in this event. Simpson has shown
rare form thus far this season.
There will be two weight events,
the shot put and the 35 pound
-weight tossing event. Valenti, Luch
and Jim MacMurdo furnish a clas.
sy enough array to sweep the shot
put, but the result of the other
event is uncertain. The Panthers
have had little experience tossing
the heavy weight and the event is
sure to be a tossup.

Monday night the Pittites face

Hughes Ineligible.

The loss of Charley Hughes,
burly Panther guard, because of
scholastic deﬁciencies, places the
already weak Panther squad in a
bad way for reserve material. Out-
side of the regular ﬁve, which in-
cludes Lawry, Kowallis, Ochsen-

Golden Panthers have only Johnny
Brown, Al Wrobleski, and Tip Ko-

To Stage Exhibitions ‘_At
Helping Hand

 

With no regularly scheduled
collegiate meet for this week.
Pitt’s boxers will turn their -minds
and fists to the good work of giv-
ing an exhibition for the board-
ers at the Helping Hand on Water
Street tonight. All bouts will be
of three rounds duration.

Six bouts will be held, practical-
ly all classes being represented by
the Panther mittmen, These bouts
besides performing 8. worthy pur-
pose, will provide the boxers with
an outletifor their excess energy
and help them maintain the form
that will be necessary for the
match with West Point next Sat-
urday.

Harry “Bing” Conti will‘ open
the festivities with Dick Zaiden,
and Ben Weiss and Joe Namlick
will swap punches for the next
three rounds. Willis Schempf and
Bernie Spiegel will box three
rounds in the 135 pound class, and
will be followed by Martin and
Santicola in another three round
bout. .

William McCarrell will meet
Eddie Bandty in one of the bouts
and “Duke” Seigel will close the
festivities with George Shotwell at
165 pounds. ‘

The exhibition bouts tonight will
enable Coach Orsini to get a. clear-
er view of his proteges, and as
another shake-up is expected for
the Army bouts, the boys will be
on their toes.

Length Of Sessions

 

Spring training for prospective members of next year’s

‘ varsity football team will begin on March 7, two weeks earlier

than the time originally planned.

There are two reasons why spring training will be held
earlier this year than it ever has been in the past according to
Jack Sutherland, coach of the Pitt team.

“We are holding practice earlier¢

this year so that it will be over in
time to permit the boys on the
squad to participate in. spring
sports if they so desire,” said the
Pitt coach. “Another reason why
we are starting earlier is because
the holdovers from last year's squad
seem extremely anxious to get
things going. Many of the boys
have come to me and asked about
the time when practice starts and I
could not overlook their requests
for an earlier period.
Weather Problem.

“The length of the spring train-
ing period will depend upon the
weather. We have been fortunate
during the past few years in having
pleasant weather for the drills, and
I am hopeful that the same condi-
tions will be true this-year. Should

..'_we have favorable weather, the pe-
.'riod will be no longer than those in

the recent past.

“The main purpose of spring
-training is the drilling of the play-
ers in fundamentals. We have no
time to do so in the fall, for the pe-
riod is short and we must meet a
major opponent practically every
week. It is often in the spring that
we discover a player whom we have
overlooked in the previous fall sea-
son.

“Take the case of Heller. He was
only a sub on hi-s freshman’ team;
but in the spring training period
following his freshman year, we
discovered that he had certain po-

1 tentialities which could be devel-

oped.

Heller was slow in starting and
did not contribute any bits of indi-
vidual brilliance until the final
game of his «sophomore year against
Penn State. There are many times
when I knew that l,had men who
were then just as good as Heller
who were sitting on the bench, but
I kept him in. He showed results
last season and should have the
best season of his career this fall.

Lose Entire Line.

“We have a lot of work to do this
spring. Our entire line composed
of all-Americans and near all-
Americans has graduated, and re-
placements for the men will be hard
to ﬁnd.

some of thgsecond string line-

‘game comes between

men showed good form last season
when called upon to play; but it
is easier for a man to look like a
miliion dollars when he goes into
a game with his team ahead by two
or three touchdowns than it is for
a man who goes into a game with
his team behind.

“Some of the players.who will
take the place of those who have
graduated are good, but they are
inexperienced and I do not expect
this year's team to make as good
a showing as last year's team did.

“We will be called upon to face
one of the toughest schedules of
any team in the country. We meet
West Virginia the last Saturday in
September, and the game is in West
Virginia. Then we meet our pals
from the city; -and you know what a
victory over Pitt would mean to
them.

Ohio State Conﬁdent.

“Then we hop to New York to
meet the Army. Army is plenty
tough. We found that out last year,
and the Cadets will be aching for
revenge when we meet them this
time. After them comes Ohio State.
A . friend of) mine from Columbus
told me that Ohio State expects to
have the Western Conference cham-
pionship in the bag before the close
of the season. And in addition, this
these with
Army and Notre Dame. That's
enough for any team. '

“But getting back to spring train-
ing, I want as many boys -as possi-
ble to come out for spring training.
Any man who comes out and shows

‘a willingness to learn will get a un-

iform. The man may have no hopes
of ever making the varsity team,
but if he loves football, he should
come out. It will beneﬁt him, it
will beneﬁt the team, and it will
beneﬁt the game as a whole.

“Last year, we took about a doz-
en boys to camp whom I didn't even
know by name. We took a roll every
day and discovered the ones who
were really interested in the game.
And as a reward we took them to
camp.

“I hope that we can ﬁnd an equal-
ly large.number of men this year
who are just as interested in the
game."

What America Needs
Is More "Bing" Contis

 

What a night? Kids were always
ringing the door bell and asking
for peanuts. “Well, Illl be glad
when this IIal1owe’en is over,”
said Mr. Conti to Mrs. -Conti on
October 31, 1911; but it was a
night never to be forgotten for at
11:00 P. M. Harry Anthony Conti
first saw the light of life..

Harry was a good boy when he
was a kid, so good in fabt that
people thought he was a sweet po-
-tato. The only trouble with him
was that he had ambitions of go-
ing to college, of boxing, and of
becoming the star singer of the
air. Most mothers will tell you
that they have a hard time con-
trolling youngsters with the slight-
est bit of ambition, but when one

child has three, then its time to’

call the fire department.
Mrs. Conti Perseveres

‘Mrs. Conti persevered and today
her little boy, Harry has neared
the realization of all his youthful
ambitions and will soon be looking
for new fields to conquer.

Maybe the story has gone a
little too fast, but the above is
an account of what he set out to
do and what he has done. Harry
was quite a runner in his school
days at Peabody and the little kids
around Lariniﬁr 8.-,,V91i.li».9 Were b9‘
ginning to sing his praises.

Then Harry received his diplo-
ma. and like many other 111811
school graduates with no jobs ‘in
sight for them went to college.
Pitt did not sponsor a boxing team
at that time, so he joined the Wil-
low club in Lawrenceville and
there received -his first instruc-
tions in the manly art of self-de-
fence. He had engaged in seven

-or eight bouts before the athletic

department at Pitt decided to sup-
port a boxing team so he dropped
his Willow club affiliations and
joined Coach Orsini’s squad.

He saw action in but one meet
last year, that with West Virginia
but when the call was issued for
candidates for the Pitt team last

October, Conti was one of the first

to report. He has taken part in
the matches with West Virginia,
Syracuse and Penn State. He was
the only Panther to win his bout
against State last week, and his
lone loss of the season, adminis-
tered at Syracuse, came at the
hands of Al Wertheimer, intercol-
legiate 125 pound champion. ‘
Never Trained

Conti has never had any train-
ing in vocal demonstrations, but
the boys around the dressing room
took note of his clear, tenor vo-
cal organs and called the atten-
tion of the Panther staff to the
fact that it was overlooking good
material for its radio programs by
not having Conti as one of its
feature attractions.

Consequently Harry made his
aerial debut on the Panther half-
hour over station WWSW, and
from the fan mail received at the
stadium, Conti is seriously consid-
ering, a vaudevilleptour after he

receives his sheepskin in June,
1933.
The boxers call him “Bing"

Conti, the “What America Needs"
singer. Bing's favorite place is.
“All of Me.” He practiced it for
hours the night before he made
his radio debut. They say that his
musical voice will be one of the
features of the next Cap and Gown
production.

Sports Writer Present
» At Big Bowling Match

 

By Saul Weisberg.

A wild tornado hit the Centre-
Neville bowling alleys last Tues-
day night, swept the pins all over
the place, frightened attendants
into convulsions, and catching the
Interfraternity bowling champ-ions
in its path buffeted and battered
them almost out of recognition and
into a state of insensibility and
somnolence. Upon close examina-
tion the tornado proved to be noth-
ing less (nor more) than the chal-
lenging faculty bowling team out
for blood and scalps, especially
those of the Pi Lambs, who are the
frat champions. ,

They came, they saw, they con-
quered. The faculty first leveled
the Pi Lambs down to their size
and then smeared them. They took
two out of three games from their
opponents and then went on play-
ing late into the night, drunk with
the sense of their own power.

Play by Play Account

The following is a play by play
account of the historic matches.
Lou Reisenstein was first for the
Pi Lambs and showing snappy
footwork, led with a left to the
head. “Diz” Distelhorst of the fac-
ﬁlty came back with a sharp right
to the breadbasket and Bunny De-
Mesquita- sent a perfect drive
sizzling down the sidelines for a
home run. “Little Poison” Rome
made a three cushion shot that
brought a gasp from the specta-
tors but Ben Weissman of the Pi
Lambs wiped the gasp from the
maps with one of the most deadly
strangleholds seen in this district
in years.

“Figety” Quick broke the stran-
glehold and knocked the chandel-
iers into bits with a vicious flying
mare, but Jerry Rosenberg absorb-
ed all they could give him and
then asked for more. He was
punch drunk. They were all punch-
drunk. “Big Poison” Jules La-
barthe broke the spell with a
stirring ride on Gallant Fox down
to the finish line where Gallant
Fox collapsed, but Big Poison was
ready for more.

Shades of Thorpe

Lou Berman ended for the Pi
Lambs with a brilliant open field
run almost for a touchdown when
“Devils” Ted Biddle brought him
down with an amazing flying
tackle. Berman fumbled and Biddle
picked the ball up and ran. the
wrong way until the meeting was
called to order by unanimous con-

went to the faculty although it
was kept a secret by the Pi Lambs
as long as possible.

The second game began with the
announcement of a substitution by
the Greeks. Sherman for Reissu-
stein was called. Sherman thought
he was playing baseball and began
throwing the balls but a brilliant

ten foot catch by Labarthe re-

Ererous and deadly, ran against‘

time in a marathon. The influence
had got him and he thought he
was John Smoyer and wasn’t sup-
posed to finish. He might have
been running yet if Diz hadn’t
gone up to himfand began hitting
him with everything but a tooth-
brush.
Words Fail Me

“A left. A right. A left. A right.
A left. A right.” (I _could keep
this up forever, but I'm not getting
paid by the word.) DeMesquita,
Rosenberg, and Berman put their
heads together to figure out some-
thing exciting. Six broken ribs,
three fractured collar bones, and
a. lost clavicle wasn’t sufficient.
They formed a flying wedge and
started for the faculty. They felt
the best way to win was to demol-
ish the faculty.

The faculty had different views
on the subject. They have differ-
ent views on every subject. They
formed a. circle and began danc-l
ing “ring around the rosie.” This]
astounded the Pi Lambs. It would
have astounded anybody. They
wouldn’t let the faculty get ahead
of them though, and they began
doing the same. The spectators fol-
lowed suit, Everyone had a lovely
time. Mrs. Eppiglottis rendered a
few vocal selections and Mrs.
Longwinded gave a talk on “Why
Little Children Should Avoid Bowl-
ing Alleys.” The faculty lost the
second match.

Keep on Laughing

The third and crucial game was
on and the atmosphere was thick
with suspense. In fact, the players
began cutting out slices with
knives and using the slices for
masks. They figured they needed‘
masks and nobody argued with
them. The faculty had been lying
low up to this time, so low the
Greeks had stepped on them. Now
they cut loose. They began throw-
ing the balls as fast as they could
get hold of them, but not at the
tenpins. They heaved them at their
opponents and chortled with glee
every time they scored a bullseye.
But their aim was bad.

Biddle received a prize for hit-
ting the “face on the wall” but the
others didn't know where the “face
on the wall’’ was so they were out

of luck. The Pi Lambs made a.
noble comeback and used the ten-i
pin-s as bats, but the bats split as’
very nearly did some of the Pi
Lambs’ heads. That was too bad.
The faculty won, the third game
and the match.
Trouble Brewing

The faculty believe they -are en-
titled to the trophy which the Pi
Lambs as winners of the interfra-
ternity bowling league champions
won. They hereby, through the col-
umns of the Pitt Weekly issue a
claim, and a serious claim, to the
trophy, They demand that they -be
given the trobhy and hope that pub-

lic opinion will fall behind them.

Expect Little

By John Thomas

The changes which the Football
Rules Committee made during its
annual convention at Hanover
last week will not affect the foot-
ball game to any noticeable extent.
At any rate, this is the opinion
of Coach Sutherland, Captain—elect
Reieler, Heller, Love, Tormey, and
Ray Montgomery, all-American
guard in 1929.

“The committee made the chang-
es which might be expected under
the circumstances, but the new
rules will not affect football very
much,” remarked Jock Sutherland.
The only one which will be fairly
noticeable is that concerning the
kickoff. Last year, the team win-
ning the toss could elect to kick
receive, or defend a goal. Now, I
believe most teams wil1'e1ect to
kick.”

Kickers Advantage

“For one thing, the receiving
team will be at an immediate dis-
advantage. The punt (if the kick-
ing team elects to do so, as it usu-
ally will if it has a fair punter)
can be placed to a corner of the
field. Concentrated speed on that
side together with the height of
the kick will give the players a
chance to get under the ball. And
the game will probably be started
within the ten yard line. Then,
another punt, and the original
kicking; team has the ball in the
middle ,of the field. As far as the
other changes are concerned, I be-
lieve that they do not amount to
much.”

“Bulldog” Reider expressed prac-
tically the same sentiments. “If
you ask, me, I think the work of
the committee this year was for
the most part unnecessary. We al-
ways had the rule against illegal
use of the hands, but it was sel-
dom enforced.” -

“I believe, though, that the kick-
off rule may change the game a
hit. As soon as the ball has trav-
eled ten yards it may be recover-
ed by the kicking side. Unless the
committee adds a clause allowing
the receiving team a fair chance
to catch the kick, there will be a
big row after the 1932 season gets
under way.”

“The other phase of the ruling
is practically the only new thing
which the committee affected. It
will eliminate the flying wedge
and should quiet down some of
the agitation about fatality. The
other rule changes are ‘scarcely
worth mentioning.

“We have had the rule about the
use of the hands. And because it
carries such a drastic penalty.
very few referees will call it. An-
other rule which has been in the
books is the one about substitu-
tion, although this is a bit differ-
ent.”

Heller Satisfied

season than it was last year,”
said Heller, Reider’s running ‘mate
in the backfield. “The one rate
which I thought might affect back-
field men is the one about 019'
suspension of play the Instant, am’
part of the ball carrier’s bod-y-_,ex--
cepting his hands or feet touches
the ground. But on second thought
I doubt if it will have so much
bearing as I first imagined. - ‘ ‘
“I agree with the rest of 
in believing that the changes 
not.,amount to as much as appears
on the surface. About the 
change of note that has taken
place is the one which will abolish
the ﬂying wedge.” ~ '..

Joe Tormey, center, d'ism1ss,ed
the rules from the standpoint of
both the spectator and‘ the player.
He said that the game, will not
look any different to the -casual

fan, and certainly the rules chang-, I. i

es would not affect the pla'y'of
the good gridders. He believes that
the game will go on practically
the same, although the new kick-
off may bring about a. slight
change for the better. ~ '
Han‘ds??? W ’
“So far as I can make out,”
stated Ray Montgomery, former
Pitt luminary, “the game of foot-
ball will not be any different
this season from, that of any other.

The rule against illegal use of,t‘h~e. _
hands, well, we’ve had that for!

quite some time. All the new rule
does is to give teeth to the rule.

Even at that I do believe that ref-

erees will hesitate to call it be-
cause of the excessively heavy
penalty attached to it. _

“Furthermore, I doubt if the
rule will charge line play to any
noticeable extent except to bring
use of the knees back. And that is
a great deal worse than the use
of hands.

“The other rules should notat-
fect football so much, especially

the way it is played here. One ‘

ruling which will scarcely touch
Pitt is the one about the equip-
ment, because Pitt uses very -little
hard padding." ‘ ,

land district. At the same
time, its name was changed
from the Western University
of Pennsylvania to its present
title. Pitt, therefore, is actu-
ally very young in years, but
its traditions and antecedents
may be traced back for several
generations. It is only right
that in this year of celebra-
tions, we should pause for one
day to reﬂect on the signiﬁ-
cant role that the University
has played in the life of this
great community.

Engineering School

STATEMENT MADE re-

cently by Dean E. H.
Holbrook, of the School of En-
gineering, to the effect that last
year Pitt had what was proba-
bly the largest graduate en-
gineering school in the country
directs attention to the facili-
ties that have made the school
so well known.

Most schools are removed
from industrial centers, and in
order to give students an idea
of what it is all about, they
must have many small scale
models of prime
other machines for
study. Here
however, we have the incalcul-
able advantages of being right
in the “Workshop of the
World,” where students have
access to -actual plants with ap-
paratus in regular operation.

Pittsburgh being the head-
quarters of some of the great-
est industrial corporations,
producing steel, glass, alum-
inum, natural gas and oil, and
being the home of world cele-
brated minemouth power sta-
tions, gives the University
other advantages.

For instance, part time in-
structors and lecturers from
among the leading engineers
and research men of local in-
dustries, bring a practical at-
mosphere to the classroom.
Also such arrangements bring
to theschool men of high cali-
ber who could not -be obtained
on any other basis.

The latest evidence of the
prominent position the Pitt
School of Engineering occupies
among American - institutions,

them to

is the fact that the ‘American ’

Institute of Chemican Engi-
neers, at its meeting in Atlanta
last December, placed Pitt on
its approved list. This list is
quite short and is intended to
include only those schools of
the highest rank.

Fine Arts Dept. Library
Gets Seven New Books

Seven valuable and interesting
volumes on typography, architec-
ture and archaeology were received
recently by the fine arts depart-
ment library. “The Annual Im-

primatur,” issued by the Society of
Booklovers of Hamburg, contains
examples of developments in mod-
ern printing. “The Antiquities of
South Russia,” by Tolstoi, Konda-
kof, and Reinach, contains source
material on Scythian art. The book
is now out of print, and constantly
increasing in value.-
Architectural tendencies are
cited in “Architecture in Mexico,”
by Geno Garcia, and “A Modern
Architectural Work," dealing with
architecture in Holland, by Paul
Bellot. “Swedish Churches,” by
Johnny Roosval, shows the trend
of Gothic Rennaisance in Europe.
“La Jeunnesse u Peintre Al

Greco,” by J. J. W lumsen, deals
with medieval art. The Carnegie
.Foundation’s new publication

‘.‘Mayan Architecture in Peru,” is
also included in the collection.

WEEKLY

Letters

To the Editor‘:-

In last week’s edition of the
Weekly you "wrote a short ed-
itorial in which you suggested
shorter trips for the debaters.
The general tone of your let-
ter, as we interpreted it, was
meant to criticise the manner
in which the debating associa-
tion was being run. To be sure
we welcome -criticism, but be-
fore you venture to write ed-
itorials on debating, we would
like to have you drop into one
of our meetings and find out
what our debating associa-
tion is doing.
~ You question the system
which selects only two stu-
dents to represent the Univer-
sity on such an extended tour
as was just taken, while the
remaining members of the As-
sociation stay at home. We
might suggest that we use the
same system of reward for
merit, that was used in select-
ing you as Editor of the Week-.
ly. We justify spending three
hundred dollars on a debater
who has worked diligently for’
three or four years, in the
same manner that you would
justify your accepting four
hundred dollars for editing the

, Weekly, while the thirty five
or forty other members on
the staff of your paper work
for glory.

Your notion of giving a larg-
er number of students experi-
ence in speaking before col-
lege audiences is a very good
but old idea. We members of
t h e D ebating Association
would like to know how you
would stimulate student inter-
est in forensics when the
school publication sees fit to
devotee six to twelve column
inches giving notice of a bridge
tea parties, and the style of
clothing students should wear,
but ,refuses adequate publicity
to an important discussion of
economic and social problems.
It may interest you to know
Mr. Editor that several of the
schools visited by our trans-
continental debater gave more
space in their paper to that
one debate than you have giv-
en for the entire twenty-one.

As for the rumor of a change
in policy coming from the De-
bating Association, we might
say that it is as much unjusti-
fied as the general criticism
which you rendered. 

The Men's Debating Association.

wage cuts, but for the March 3
debate they will make a stand for
Dmgressive capitalism.

John Bracken and William But-
terbaugh for the affirmative, and
Leonard Boreman and David Sand-
let for the negative debated the
question “Resolved: That Congress
should enact legislation providing
for the centralized controlrof in-
dustry” before the congregation
of the . West Elizabeth M. E.
Church on Sunday, February 21.

Present indications for the
Southern trip of the debaters are
that it will be considerably shorter
than the trip lindertaken to the
west coast. It is likely that the trip
will consume ten days time during
Easter vacation although some
difficulty has been ‘encountered
due to the fact that many of the
Southern universities will have
recess at the same time as Pitt.

Y1”, YW Groups Hear
Social Worker Today

 

Club programs and unadjusted
youth will be the subject of a speech
to be heard by the Social Service
Volunteers of Y. M. and Y. W. C.
A., at 12:30 today in Heinz House.
The speaker is Miss Mary J. Con-
don, Pittsburgh social service
worker.

Realizing that present condi-
tions demand as able and as wide-
spread organization and attack as

would a war, the social agencies
are trying to supply the needs of
the underprivileged groups. Many
of the workers are coming from
colleges, and Miss Condon will ex-
plain what the University volun-
teer can do.

After the luncheon meeting,
MISS Condon will remain in the
Y. W. office at Heinz House to ar-
range personal conferences.

Finance Problem Faces
Annual Spring Event

 

Plans for the Spring Festival are
expected to be developed within
the next few weeks, according to
Walter J. Rome, graduate manager
of student activities. ’

Faced with the necessity of ﬁnd-
ing means to ﬁnance the annual
events, Mr. Rome and members of
Student Council will endeavor to
adopt a suitable plan at the next
regular meeting of «the governing
body, scheduled for next Wednes-
day.

Last spring the events were ﬁ-
nanced largely by the treasury of
the senior class. This year's grad-
uating class, however, has only
$5.51 in its reserve fund, as the
result of a. deﬁcit encountered last
year in staging the Junior Prom.

Candidates for the position of
chairman and coed chairman of the
events are expected to take out pe-
titions the ﬁrst week in March.
They will be elected by student
council -at its meeting on March 16.
Selection of the Senior Ball chair-
man will probably be deferred un-
til a later time.
