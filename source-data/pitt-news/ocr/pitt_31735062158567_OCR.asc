To Ask For
7.8 Million

The University will ask the
State legislature for a sub-
sidy of-$7,830',O00 this fall to
help meet expenses for gen-
eral maintenance in the com-
ing two ﬁscal years. _

This ﬁgure represents an in-

‘ creaseﬂof 65 per cent over the

$4,737,546 received for the 1957-
58 term. This amount was far be-
low the amount requested by the
University.

.Each, year, Pitt receives sub-
sidies -from’ the state for general
maintenance, the ‘medical school,

\ and the administration of Western‘
‘ State" Psychiatric Institute and

Clinic. ' .

The ‘total amount received for
all three purposes’ last year was
$9,894,166. The University has not
announced what it will request for
the latter two purposes this year.

The request for general main-

tenancefunds will be submitted
together with requests from Tem-
ple University and the University,
of Pennsylvania. .
: The requests of the three
schools“ total $23,800,000, an in-
‘crease of more than 69 per cent
over the last appropriation.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld released
the ﬁgures at a joint meeting of
thethree universities at the ‘York-
town‘Hotel,‘ Yorktown, Pa. He ex-
plained thatthe rising costs made

“Cadet Dance

F or Army Men
Slated In Union

The University of’ Pitts-
burgh is planning a dance in

honor of the Cadets of West ,

Point after the Army football
gafne. The dance will be held
in the Student Union Ball-
room,_Oct_. 25, from 8-11 p.m.

Approximately‘ 600 Cadets from
the Junior Class‘ will be in Pitts-
burgh for the game. Only.33 of
the ‘Cadets want dates for the
evening -dance. Thirty—ﬁve other
Cadets will attend the dance with
their own'dates.

Any woman student may sign
up’ in theiD.O.W. Office on the
12th floor until Tuesday, Oct. 7,
1958. The women will receive the
name of their Cadet and other in-
formation". The Cadet will receive
a letter with similar information.

June Kemmler, Ed. ’60, social
chairman ofiAWS, and her com-
mittee have charge of matching
each woman with the Cadet ac-
cording to religion, height, and so
forth. The girls will probably have
to provide their own" transporta-
tio/n to and from the dance, since
the Cadets have to take their train
at approximately 12:30.

~The size of the SU Ballroom
will limit the number of Pitt stu-
dents who can attend. Tickets will
be printed and available for Uni-
versity students on a ﬁrst come,

  without a ticket.

,Ann Pongratz, Arts, ’60, Social

include a list of places of inter-
est in this area. Plans and tickets

By MURRAY CHASS

Two years ago in Memorial
Stadium, — Minneapolis, a ref-

eree’s call of clipping ruined .

the Panthers’ chance of de-
feating the Minnesota Goph-

Last Saturday on the same‘ stage,
it was a linesman’s decision of nfo-7
Panther—touchdown in a one—foot/

-di_ve in_the ﬁnal quarter that start?
ed the Panthers on their way to a

this season. ‘ .

The crucial call this time came
at about the» three-minute mark
of the fourth period when Full-
back Bob Stark dived high over
_center—apparently into the end

down. \

After much consternation on).
the part of all ﬁve ofﬁcials, it
was decided that Stark had not

0 made it, but insteaddwas halted
-the minutest of -inches short of
the goalline. (The nose of the
ball’ was placed so that it just

‘ missed touching the chalk
stripe.) - _ ‘ _

This call, according to Stark,
was “what made the team go.”
“The B team was in there and
they really got mad,” Stark de-
“It would have been the
first touchdown for me. I’ve never
‘scored one and I’m looking for one.
That really made me mad.” The
.day’s- leading ground gainer added
that some of the other penalty
callsalsoigot the team “up.”_ V

Actually, from the looks of
things, a Minnesota win started on
the down grade at the beginning
of the last quarter. Behind, 7-0,
the Panthers had the ball on their
own three, second and nine.

_ On two successive plays Stark
bolted for 32 yards and starting
Quarterback Ed Sharockman
carried for 20 to take the Pan-
thers out ‘-of danger. It was out
this series of plays that-the pro-
vocative goal line dive occurred.
" Sharockman explained how the
Panthers were able to break
through,the Gopher defense and

out from inside the,» ﬁve. 7

“I looked for a -weakness and
found it off our right side. ‘They
were thinking that we’d go up the
middle, and they pinched in. It
was a natural hole.” ,

',Not long after, the Panthers
__marched right back into Gopher
territory and made sure that
they would not be upset. The--
man who wound up scoring both
touchdowns was senior signal-
caller Bill Kaliden.

Actually it was a sweet, per-
-sonal: revenge for Will. Back in
1956, he fumbled on fourth down
in Panther territory to help set up
the ﬁeld ‘goal that won for Min-
nesota. : '

Minnescotahad scored ﬁrst early
in the third quarter after recov-

runback of“the second-half kick-
off. Fullback Roger Hagberg broke
the scoreless deadlock with a six-
yard dash around right end. Ev-
erett Gérths kicked the extra
point.

According to,Coach John Miche-
losen, Minnesota was no tougher
than hesthought they would be.
He did say that the ﬂankers and
unbalanced line used by the Goph-

ers was something he hadn’t seen

before in ,,their offense. ‘

Big Mike seemed to be a little
wary of the oﬁiciating although
he didn’t come right out and say
it directly.’ “Every time I looked,
the ﬂags were ﬂying,” was his
lone comment.

No. one was seriously hurt, but
there were a few minor injuries.
Ed ‘Michaels sustained a sprained
right elbow in the ﬁrst half, but
he says it will be okay in two or
three days. Kaliden’s left instep
didn’t give him any trouble dur-
ing the game, but he did sprain his
right ankle. '

The only other injury was a
sprain and bruise of. Chuck Rein-
hold’s left ankle. - -
