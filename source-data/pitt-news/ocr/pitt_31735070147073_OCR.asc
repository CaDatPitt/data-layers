Greek spelling bee pulls in fundsfor charity

Amy Friedenberger
Senior Staff‘ Writer

When'Pi Kappa Alpha brother Rob
Siravo stepped up to the podium
to spell a word, he asked the em-

- cee to put the term into a “sexual”

sentence.
After proctor Rachel Kasab of
Kappa Kappa Gamma refused, she

" used the word “genital” in a more

PG sentence.
“Men have a genital,” she said,

as a room full of Greeks burst into .

laughter.
Unfortunately for Siravo, he

spelled the word “G—E-N—I—T—L— ‘

E” and was knocked out of the
early. round.

Pitt sorority Kappa Kappa
Gamma hosted the second annual
Spelling Bee last night in front of
a packed auditorium in 120 Da4
vid Lawrence Hall. All proceeds
went to Kappa Kappa Gamma’s
national philanthropy, Reading
is Fundamental, which promotes
literacy.

Kappa Kappa Gamma philan-
thropy chair Dani Marks said that
the event raised about $500.

Two Greeks per house could
participate, each of whom had to
pay a $15 entrance fee. Admission
to the event was $1. A total» of 32
people‘ from 16 sororities and
fraternities‘participated.

“We decided to have the Spell— _ .

"really good turnout last year,”-

Marks said. “The Greek commu-

«She said that Tuesday night

was a success.

the word “sebaceous,” which
means secreting fatty material,
after she faced off against Phi

card worth $50.

Heckling can’t  
resolve disputes

' rowing up in the American
I primary education system,

we’re taught to stand up for
what we believe in. Democracy,
we’ve been told, can only boast
legitimacy when it freely allows
even those holding the most un-
popular views to voice them. Of
the Enlightenment philosophies
the United States was built upon,
free speech formed a crucial pillar,
a bedrock that continues to beneﬁt
us today. I _~
But it’s important to note that
louder speech might not always be
freer. As a story out of California
prompts us to ask: Is standing up
for your beliefs synonymous with
standingup to a public presenta-
tion you disagree with? What place
does heckling a public event have
in a free society —— our country’s
and also Pitt’s?
According to the Los Ange-

" les Times, 11 University of Cali- _

fornia - Irvine and University of.
California - Riverside students —
the so—called “Irving 11” — were
criminally charged last Week for
conspiring to interrupt a speech
attempted last year at UC Irvine by

‘ Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren.

Speaking in front of an audience of
about 500 people on UC Irvine’s
campus in February 2010, Oren
was interrupted by 10 outbursts
of shouting. Threats to the ambas-
sador were largely absent from the
heckling, as the ﬁrst offender sim-
ply criticized Israeli policy, saying,

“Propagating murder is not an ex- ,
. pression of free speech?’ Believed
- to be part of the Muslim Student

Union, offenders were promptly
removed and arrested by on-site
police ofﬁcers.

For the year following the event, ,

the university had exclusively
handled the disciplinary response,
temporarily suspending the Mus-
lim Student Union and privately
disciplining the student hecklers.

‘I But now that Orange County, Calif.,

prosecutors are pursuing crimi-

_nal charges against the students,

a reactionary fervor‘ is brewing

I in the community. The Bosto_n

Globe reported that protesters as-
sembled this week in front of the
Orange County district attorney’s

ofﬁce and local religious leaders
signed an open lette_r asking the
district attorney not to indict the
students.“ V ' I I

The plight of the “Irving 11”

- highlights a widely disputed area

of First Amendment law. Court
rulings on the constitutionality of
shouting down a speaker have been
sparse and vague, thought by many
to allow law enforcement to remove
hecklers if ofﬁcers predict —- but
not preemptively —— that violence
could erupt secondary to the'heck—
ling. Though the government can’t

legally suppress peaceﬁil heckling -

on its own behalf, private organi-
zations — like most universities
— can. For example, Pitt’s Student
Code of Conduct binds students to
behave in ways that do “not inter-
fere with the educational process,”
an interference that could easily be
ascribed to heckling.

Although we publish each
morning under‘ the name of The
Pitt News and not The Pitt Con-
stitutional Scholar, we can still un-
derstand the threat_that “Irvine

‘ 11”—style heckling poses to the edu-

cational process. People shouldn’t
Voluntarily enroll in a university
to buzz their vocal chords so as

to drown out dissenting opinion;

instead their time would be better
spent civilly participating in the
"collegiate marketplace of ideas.
Universities like UC Irvine and Pitt
offer an invaluable opportunity for
students to not only ﬁnd people
who disagree with them, but also
to learn how to interact with these
people to somehow build a better
world. I
That’s why universitiesshould

at least be allowed to protect their .

the dangers of heckling. Though

college hecklers, even in cases of
premeditated heckling, might be
going too far. » ’

Columnist

One of the toughest things to deal with
is losing, and the toughest loss of all is
a Super Bowl loss. Although it’s now
been scientiﬁcally proven that our be-
loved hometown Pittsburgh Steelers
can’t hang with those flint-eyed Pack-

‘ ers fro_m'Green Bay, we mustn’t forget

that our city has been voted America’s

On top of that, we’ve beneﬁted from
nearly. eight decades of mayoral rule

democracy is as healthy in Pittsburgh
as it is anywhere in the free world.
After all, if voters reallyhad problems
with the Democratic. Party, wouldn’t

mist). In this colunm, we’re going to
take that one step further and argue
that it’s also the most lovable city.

Let’s start with local politics. Un- '

likeGreenBay mayorjim Schmitt, who
is old enough to have watched “The
Rockford Files” when it ﬁrst aired
on NBC, our MTV-ready boy—mayor
has justtumed 30. Did you know that

. Mayor Luke Ravenstahl appeared on

the Late Showwith David Letterman?
That’s so cool there aren’t even words
to adequately describe the coolness.
Seriously — flip through the thesau-

local news sources, the weather’s
unpredictable quality adds a dash of
valuable drama to our lives. Instead
of having to endure an interminable
string of mild, sunny days, we have
the chance to plan our commutes
around the possibility of all those
ferocious blizzards that almost hap-
pened and still might. Such planning
can turn one’s otherwise humdrum
existence into an endless replay of the
Y2K panic —- and really, who could
say no to something that turns the
simple act of purchasing toilet paper,

‘ Replete with Christina Aguilera and ketchup, S'teel.City vibrant as ever

ball-point pens and canned corn into V‘

arace against time? .
In addition to the glorious weath-
er, our own independent research has

revealed that the Pittsburgh accent '

is the sexiest accent of all. The Scots,
Irish and Scots-Irish might have
reasonable cases, but the-melliﬂu—
ous sound of measured Pittsburgh
cadences can bring any out—of-town
bar or nightclub to a standstill. It’s
little wonder, then, that our nation’s
greatest sports orators — men like
“Iron” MikeDitka, “Broadway” Joe
Namath and “Dapper” Dan Marino
—— hailfromthis region. And we’d be
remiss if we didn’t mention legend-

ary chanteuse and Pittsburgh native’

Christina“Xtina”Aguilera, whose dar-
ing reinterpretaﬂon of the national
anthem at the Super Bowl wowed the
critics even as it won her legions of
adoring new fans.

‘But we Pittsburghers do more than
talkthetalk—'we also eatanddrink
like kings. Even people from as far

_ the high quality of our sandwiches,

french ﬁ'ies andfsandwiches with

everything served at our fast—food
restaurants is buried under a pile of
cheese and mayonnaise, anavalanche
of deliciousness that can’t be denied.

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

There seems to be a continu-
ous liberal bias that perforates
this paper. For example, Emily
Rileyfs article (“Chick—fil—A de-
bate reaches Pitt’s campus,” Feb.

7) on the Chick-ﬁl—A “controver— '

sy” was absurd. There was little
mention of the pro—marriage side
of the argument, and when she
did, the comments were littered
with negative connotations.
Rather, she decided to focus on
how “insulting” it is that a food
chain would freely donate food
to organizations. We should be

thanking Chick-ﬁl—A for protect-
ing marriage, which by defini-
tion is the union between a man
and a woman. On anothernote,
what has happened to America?
Are companies not free to state
an opinion anymore? Is this the
U.S.S.R. orﬁthe -land of the free
and the home of the brave?

The paper’s second major flaw
was the support of free condoms.
If girls do not want to become
pregnant, then why not refrain
from sleeping with their boy-

" friends? That is not to say that sex

is wrong —-— it’s great, however, it
can be misused, as your editorial

insinuates. You seem to fail to
realize that using contraceptives
is the same as having an abortion,
just at a much earlier stage than
actually needing a doctor to kill
the baby for you.

That said, I fervently hope '

that you attempt to right your
sinking ship before it is too late.
When I pick up the paper in the
morning, I expect a high—quality
paper, and recently, I have not
gotten that. Here’s to a better
paper in the future. '

obsessed with playing it.

Today Stu Braun continues to ’

This isn’t the first time The

Turpentiners have performed for '

the Calliope Folk Music Society,
according to the nonproﬁt’s exec-

“Many musicians in The Tur-
pentiners also perform in other
projects and have performed for

A Calliope in those groups,” Tan-

ner said in an e—mail. “The band
leader, Ben Hartlage, has been
involved in the Calliope com-
munity for many years and is
a former board member of the
organization.”

"Formed in 2007, The Turpen-

ALBUM REVIEW

Sara Pecora
Staff Writer
Brett Staggs
Brett Staggs
Self-Released

Rocks Like: Bill Deasy, Gin Blossoms
Grade: B" ‘ ~

up Local artist Brett Staggs’ debut solo album

has been seven years in the making 4 he
recorded the songs in several states. The
time shows, both in amount of material — 20
tracks — and in effort. Staggs has created a
simple,"folksy rock album.

, While it’s" quite a lengthy CD, it’s deﬁnitely‘
worth ‘a listen, whether you’re a folk-rock lov-
er or still dying for the ’90s to come back.

The album has a distinctly different sound
from that of Staggs’ band, The Long Time

Darlings. Whereas The Long Time Darlings

-Staggs’ 7ryears of work
on album worth the time

savors of country, Brett Staggs’ solo work

has more of an Americana rock, borderline

’90s, alternative sound to it. .

' The large number of songs demonstrate
the vast range of musical genres in which
Staggs feels comfortable. He swings from
’90s alt in “Bloomﬁeld” to slow rock in songs
like “Electric Heart.” He moves from Ameri-
cana/Southern rock in “Brain Matter” to
stripped down, soulful acoustic in “Hangover
Blues.” ’ V . »

A standout track is “Places I Pass
Throug ,”-a folksy rock song featuring the
intriguing addition of an organ played by
local artist Ben,Hardt. The variety of mu-
sical types, tempos and ﬁdelities gives the
album the potential to reach many different
audiences.

Its length and style make the CD particu- '

our gigs have come from word of mouth.
People who see us somewhere and ﬁnd a
way to get in touch with us. We’ve been kind
of on an extended streak of good fortune
to this point.”

As for their music, the band covers half
of its songs and plays original songs as
well, Braun said. ,

“The band members  perform a wide
variety of vintage American music,” Tanner
said. “The Turpentiners are a young local
group, and an important part of Calliope’s

mission is to provide performing oppor-

tunities for local artists.”

“The showion Thursday will be half-
and-half as well,” Braun said. “[Ben] is
good. He writes songs that you’d think
were 80 years old. The original songs pay
tribute to the old.-style songs as well. It’s
not all stuff from the 1930s.”

“Sometimes we cook up an original,
but the focus is mostly on some real ﬁne
old chestnuts from the vaults,” Hartlage
said.

Performing live has been the band’s
strong point for years. Though the topic
of recording a CD has come up, it hasn’t
happened yet, Hartlage said.

“We have a couple of songs/videos on
YouTube and God knows where else from
cellphone videos and such,” he said. “When
you’re not the kind of band that will move
CDs by the bushel, it’s just hard to jus-
tify the expense of a 10o0—plus CD print
run and design and packaging and studio
time.” . '

But CD or not, the band cares about and
loves performing, Braun said.

A “Good times and bad, music’s always
been there,” he said. “It’s been a driving
force in my life. I’ve never wanted_to not
play. I couldn’t imagine not playing in some
capacity.” . A

Injury only a smallsetback for Cafaro

Cafaro< 10

people to feel bad for him,” Pitt linebacker
Max Gruder said.

The next season, Cafaro was ﬁnally eli-
gible to play in a Divison I game, and in the
season opener at home against Bowling
Green, his dream to ofﬁcially play college
football was fulﬁlled.

“That was unreal, just to have that feeling.
Also that feeling to prove all the naysayers
wrongl guess,” Cafaro said. “My grandpar-

 ”ents,,rny_parents, brotherandeister were

there at the game as well as my friends.”

He played in 11 games that season, re-
cording two tackles and proving to be a wor-
thy asset to the Panthers’ kickoff coverage
unit. He looked to be even more involved
the next season, but another obstacle to his
career came up almost immediately.

In the following season opener against

Youngstown State, Cafaro tore the ACL in —

his left knee. The injury would keep him out
for the rest of the year.

“It was a freak thing. We were blowing
Youngstown State out, I had two tackles al-
ready and the ball just got miskicked a little
bit,” he said. “I saw it on the ground, got
excited and went to cut and got blindsided
and my foot just stuck in the ground.”

Playing with reckless abandon could’ve
contributed to the injury, another reason
his teammates respect his play.

. “I really can’t say enough about Dan. He
was the guy running down the ﬁeld break-
ing the wedge on the kickoff. That shows
how big his heart is,” former Pitt linebacker
Adam Gunn said. "

- During the game, Cafaro and the Pitt
training staff didn’t know the full severity
of the injury. Cafaro was able to jog off the
ﬁeld with the trainers who then decided to
hold him out of the game simply for precau-
tionary reasons. ‘

Cafaro then got the news that we would

_ miss the entire 2009 season with the injury,

but he stayed upbeat —— he had already been
through much worse.

“The ACL rehab wasn’t that bad,” he said.
“I thought the rehab would be a lot worse
than it really was.”

That would’ve been his last year of eligi-
bility for the Panthers, but a petition to the
NCAA was awarded and he was granted a
rare sixth year.

~ Gunn knows all about the process to
gainca sixth year of eligibility, as he too was
awarded one after breaking a vertebrae in

‘his neck against Bowling Green, during the

same game in which Cafaro made his col-
legiate debut.

“Just knowing Dan’s story, it’s truly amaz-
ing. That just shows the kind of person he
is. when you just look at him you wouldn’t-
see a guy with such a big heart,” Gunn said.
“You see a little guy with a small stature, but
he’s so much more than that. I really can’t
say enough about Dan.”

Cafaro returned to the team this past ' 

season and played a key role as a leader on

the ﬁeld and on the Panthers special teams
unit. He graduated last semester with a de-
gree in communication.

For Cafaro, football is the game he loves
and nothing was going to stop him from
participating in it. He said he will take that
approach to challenges that face him the
rest of his life.

“My mindset’s always been: nothing
worth having in life comes easy,” he said.
“In any aspect of lifewhethernitsfootball, a
girl, a job, anything.” I ” S ‘ '
