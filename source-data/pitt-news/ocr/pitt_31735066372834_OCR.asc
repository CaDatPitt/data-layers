Board
Approves

Budgets

By LAURIE MocLEOD

The Student Government Board I

(SGB) rejected the budgets for the
International Affairs Forum and
Quo Vadis, which will be re-
presentedby the Allocations Com-
mittee today.

The International Affairs forum
budget was rejected because the
Organization of American States
and the Model United Nationspro-
jects were not recommended by the

Allocations Committee.

The projects were considered
more competitive’ than educa-

tional, according to Allocations‘

Committee chairman Bob Colo-
simo.. He said the committee would
re—examine the budget and present
it again today. ~ /

Board member Chip Roth said
he thought the goal of the organi-
zation’s projects was educational.
He said the group would “gain
practical diplomatic experiences.”

SGB rejected the recommended
funding of the “Washington,jD.C.
excursion trip” for Quo Vadis, a
group which gives tours of the
Nationality Rooms in the Cathe-
idral of Learning.

The “excursion trip," which
includes visits to museums and art
galleries in Washington, was
requested so that the group can

gain exposure to tour guide-

techniques.
Roth said funding the trip
would be “wasteful" because‘ it

doen’t include any instruction or

“direct learning of tour guiding.”

In other business, the Engineer-
ing StudentCabinet requested the
re-opening of its budget because it
was unable to attend the meeting

- last week when it was approved. I

" The board rejected this request
because this precedent would allow
any group to ask to have its budget
re-opened’, according to Roth.

Student Parking Security Examined
Students Make Suggestions   I

By VICKI JACKSON

Many resident’ students who
have expressed a desir,e to bring val-
uable and/or customized cars to
school next fall areunsure if the
security in the Forbes and Towers

‘garages is good enough, according

to Pitt student Frank Louyis.

For this reason, Isouvis-—»
chairman of the Tower B Security
and Safety (Iommittee——has met
with campus polite to outline the
security program for the garages.

According to l,ou\'is. needed
security measures for the garages
are: to have campus police patrol
the garages more frequently; an
alarm system; and security caineras
for the Towers garage——-similar to
those now in the Forbes garage.

Parking in the two garages is on
a “first-come, first-serve basis" for

“The campus police seem very
cooperative about dealing with

these problems and they will

increase patrols if any develop-
ments arise," said Louvis.

resident students and is handled
through the Housing Office. Cost
is $120 per term in the Towers gar-
age and 359.3 per term in the Forbes
garage.

Both garages are patrolled by the
campus police on their regular
rounds and parking there is viewed
safer than most Oakland public
parking garages, said Louvis.
According to a spokesman for the
Campus Police, there have been
“very. few incidents” in the garages
during the past six to eight
months.

Making sure the garage door
closes before pulling out is one
safety tip both Louyis and the cam-
pus police strongly stress to garage
users.

Although the Towers garage is
more secure because of its, key-
operated door.’ the Tower B Secur-
ity and Safety Committee, which is
part of the Resident Student Asso-
ciation, is looking into having
both garages’ doors close faster.

 

The Tower 3 Safety and Security Committee is looking into
ways to upgrade security in both the Towers and Forbes stu-
dent parking garages. ‘

By LARRY LEDERER

Born in Bellefon-te—-—a small
town in the middle of Pennsylva-
nia, English Professor Philip
Wion recalls hislove, of literature.

“Literature enabled me to be a ‘T

generalist. By this I mean I’m not
locked up into any specific disci-
pline, instead, in studying litera-
ture, one can think "about many
fields such as history, philosophy,
psychology and even social rela-
tionships. I was fascinated by this
even as a child,” Wion said.
Wion’s fascination of literature
took him to the undergraduate’
honors program at Swarthmore:
College, where he was graduated
Phi Beta Kappa in 1963. This
enabled him to qualify for the
Woodrow Wilson National»
Fellowship—a stipend awarded to
graduate students intending to go
into college education. ‘ ,
His graduate work was done at
Yale University where he received
his doctorate in 1967. At Yale,.he
began to develop a specialization
in literature, the Renaissance
period. In particular, Wion studied
extensively Chaucer, Milton‘ and
Shakespeare. He wrote his Ph.D.

dissertation on a stylistic study of .

Edmund Spenser’s writing, then
came to Pitt to begin his teaching
in 1967, where he currently holds
the title associate professor.

The German writer Thomas
Mann's book The Magic Moun-
tain, ].R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of
the Rings and Spenser’s The Faeri
Quee-ne were among his favorite
readings. All three of these books,
according to Wion, deal with fan-
tasy and romance, of which he is

quently offers a course on the
subjects. '

Currently, Wion is conducting.

an honors seminar subheaded
“Literature and Psychoanalysis.”
“This course examines how
literature explores psychological
complexities, and psychoanalysis
is the most useful intellectual disci-
pline for the understanding of
someof the unconscious dimen-

— sions of literature; things that go

on beneath the surface,” Wion
said. i
“I enjoy this kind of teaching
because a small group enables me
to focus not only on literature, but
how individuals respond to litera-
ture in terms of their own personal-
ities. Each person tends to find a
parellel between something in
literature and their own life."
Wion said examining literature
is an “integrating and synthesiz-’
ing” activity. He said his courses
this term is a reflection of his feel-;
ing that “literature enables me to;
bring things together.” I
Wion is a believer that people
ought to make beneficial and last-
ing connections. His work as presi-
dent of the Pit-t Professional Union
(PPU) and co-chairman of the
newly formed United Faculty
(which includes all members of the
PPU and Pitt's chapter of the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors, AAUP) confirms
this point.

“The UF organization will help
bring faculty together at Pitt. and

emphasize what we have in com- '

rnon, especially in the face of rising
economic and political difficulties
such as student aid cutbacks,” he

—Page 3

‘Profile: Philip Wion, Pitt English Professor

said. “We must be active in defend-
ing higher education and other
interests we as faculty have."

One of the major “difficulties”
Wion labors over is the “tightness”
of college teaching opportunities.
He said jobs in the 19605 were plen-
tiful and added that “it was easy to
move into anew situation."

“Things in the 1970s were much
tighter due to economic and politi-

.cal changes—faculty needs to work

together as the individual faces
much less power and opportunity
on their own,” he said.

“There’s not a whole lot the
individual member can do about
student aid cutbacks, for example.
Faculty and even students ought to
work together as that's what
unions and the labor management
are all about: gaining theinfluence
to unite and organize." V

As president of the PPU for the I

past twoyears, Wion said one of his
biggest accomplishments was the
formation of the UF. Also,Wion
said he was pleased with the
response from Pitt faculty but

added that “unionizing is a long,

complex process because we’re try-

ing to form a strong and demo- _
' cratic organization.”

Besides serving on various Uni-
versity Senate and Department of
English committees, Wion. who
used to play viola in the University
Chamber Orchestral, now, along
with his wife and daughter, plays
with the Westmoreland Symphany
Orchestra.

A sabbatical is in store for Wion
next year. He plans to doa psy-
choanalytical study of Emily

Hamlet,The Merry Wives of
Windsor, and The Tempest
will highlight the 1982 Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival—a
co-project of the University of

The plays will be performed
continuously from June 17
through Aug. 15 at the Stephen

located on Forbes Ave. Hamlet
will be performed June 17-July
3. The Merry Wives of Windsor .
will be performed July 8-24 and
The Tempest will be performed
July 29-Aug. 15.

Ned Read, associate producer
of the Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival, anticipates a very good
season this year.

“We will have a popular sea-

probably one of the best known
‘works of Shakespeare and The
Merry Wives of Windsor and
PT he Tempest are probably the
second best,” Read said.
Other reasons will also con-

son this year because Hamlet is ‘

tribute to having a successful
season, according to Read.
“We have developed a very
good reputation; we have very
high hopes," he explained.
“Also, the trend of a second year
seems to be the most difficult
therefore, starting our third
year will be much better."
The core of the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival is formed
company
called The City Theatre Com-
pany. Read said the The City
Theatre Company advises the
Shakespeare Festival on how to
“structure management,
increase audiences, increase
profits, etc.” Very soon The
City Theatre Company and
The Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival will become more uni-
ted through FEDAPT—The
Foundation for the Extension
and Development of the Ameri- F
can Professional Theatre.
“Seventy-five people will
probably be employed this year,
less than half of the employess
from last year. We cut down on
employees because it eases

will result in a higher quality

Auditions for this summer's
productions took place in Pitts-
burgh, New York and Chicago.
Some 170 actors were auditi-
oned in Pittsburgh, and about
300 actors were auditioned in

Read said auditions, which
began two weeks ago,were
finalized yesterday. Actors will

pretty bleak for almost all college

lege of Allegheny County and
California State College were in
attendance to hear the opinions of
11 panel members, from various
areas of specialty, as they discussed
the value of a B.A. degree is social
work. In addition to the panelists,
Sutton gave the keynote address
and three senior social work
majors presented position papers.

, 41  J
In her keynote address, Suttorﬂ‘

stressed the idea that social workers
have diverse skills and can be very
useful in many areas, including
administration and personnel
work. She called attention to the
fact that social work students are
taught to work with people and to
solve problems and that these
skills, coupled with administrative
training, can be valuable to many
potential employers.

Sutton also pointed out that
social workers must become politi-
cally involved and form linkages
with each other throughthe
with each other through the
National Association of Social

Workers and with people in othb"

professions who are involved in
providing social services.

She made it clear that the field of,

social work is a professional field
and that a social worker can be
most effective if he orshe continues

- to keep informed after graduation.

The panelists also addressed the

questions of jobs, social work prac-
‘ tice and the social work profession,

during separate workshops.

‘The students in attendance
gained new insight into ways in
which they can use their skills, and
finding jobs which are available to
them, aswell as learning effective

ways in which they can provide _

social services and combat the
myths and stereotypes of the
bleeding-heart social worker. '

The students were encouraged to
develop their math, communica-
tion and leadership skills to

Can you imagine reading‘ a
newspaper that you weren't
allowed to take out of your own
country? Guan Ke-Guang, visiting
scholar from the People’s Republic
of China, spoke of such a paper
during a recent lecture at -Pitt. ’

Ke-Guang, an English liiiguis-
tics teacher at the Foreign Lan-
guages Institute in Shanghai, was
sent to the United States to study
journalism this year. He admitted

‘ to a lack of knowldege of joiirnal-
ism, although he discussed the
Chinese media.

The Reference News, an interna-
tional news tabloid, _cannot be
taken out of the country through

, orders tithe Communist Party. Ke- ‘

Guang said he must pickup the
Reference News at the institute
‘where he works and return the
paper when he is finished reading
it for “recycling.” Many of the arti-
cles dealt with international polit-
ics, he said. ‘

All newspapers are controlled by
the Chinese Communist Party, and
the Department of Propaganda
oversees all media within China.
Ke-Guang explained that one
paper PAeopIIe"s Daily, which con-

sists of eight pages, is the official
paper of the Central Committee of

' the Party. Thisgpaper is for all peo-

ple of China, including profession-

Other papers in China include
Liberation Daily, One Way Daily
for intellectuals and a special daily
for young people Youth Daily. The
Chinese Communist Youth
League publishes this paper to
inform young adults of China’s
political news. 8

All of the information used in
China’s newspapers comes from
Xinhua, meaning “new China.”
This worldwide news agency has
40 agencies that send stories back to
the local publications. Every pro-
vincial party committee in China
has its own daily, but all the news is
the same. The front page of one
Chinese paper may look exactly

and how they devote themselves to

the front page. This is a way of
showing that party officials are

party officials are used on the front
page.

Other articles deal with farming,

Ke-Guang said size is a major
difference between United States
and'Ch,i_nese papers.

“To begin with, American pap-
ers have many pages while in
China, a paper will have only four
to eight pages. Secondly, the Uni-
ted States uses its papers to inform
the people but in China, the party
uses newspapers for politically
educating its people. Articles are
used more often than news stories,"
Ke-Guang added. . ,

  Opinion  

ed Schoolstiféery

If Pitt’s School of Medicine doesn't do some surgery on
its own internal hemorrhaging pretty soon,*the patient
may just die before it reaches the operating table.

Besides its usual financial difficulties, additional prob-
lems plagued the medical school last week when charges
arose that the school ignored university recruitment
guidelines in the appointment of an assistant biochemis-
try professor. The charges, included in a request for an
investigation filed with Pitt’s Office of Affirmative
Action, come from that persistent gadfly of the medical
school, bipchemistry professor Robert Glew.

Despite our recognition that Glew has been leveling
various charges against the medical school at every oppor-
tunity he gets, we think he knows better than to cry wolf on
such, sensitive issues. Ir1 this case, we feel Glew’s charges
warrant a full investigation into how far the administra-
tion is going in its attempt to revitalize the school’s basic
science departments. '

Glew says that at a March 11 meeeting of department
faculty, biochemistry chairman Norman- Curthoys
announced that William Kappel, a post-doctoral fellow at
St. Louis University’.s medical ‘school, had been appointed
to a vacant biochemistry position. The opening for the
tenure-track position was neither announcedor adver-
tised, Glew,claims, thereby violating universitysenate
policies, which require that a search committee be formed
to recruit candidates. , i _ ’

Adding further confusion to the matter is a mysterious
memo sent from Curthoys to the department’s senior
faculty that was also supposed to have announced the
appointment. Attached to that memo is the impetus of
Glew’s charges: a ‘March 1 letter from Robert Olson,
"recently appointed as the medical school's associate dean

for academic affairs, to Curthoys, in which Olson recom-I

mends that Kappel be appointedto the position.

If the Office of Affirmative Action does investigate the
affair, and we urge it to do so if it hasn't already, there are
some important questions that need to be answered: I

0 Was Olson’s appointment contingent upon some sort

of agreement whereby he would be able to hire-a colleague.

without going through normal hiring procedures? Curt-
hoys implies such an agreement was made between medi-
cal school Dean Donald Leon and Olson, with Pitt

Chancelor Wesley Posvar giving them permission to

waive the normal procedures.iIf this is the case, then not
only shouldthe affirmative action office determine that
such an agreement existed, but it should also find out if
other such waivers by thechancellor have occured in the
university. The whole idea of the chancellorhaving an
“executive veto” seems contrary to the principles of affir-
mative action. I

0 Was Kappel appointed—then un-appointed-"after
Glew. filed his charges? From the confusing statements
Curthoys has been making recently, Kappel is described as
doing everything from joining the department in Sep-
tember to not even'being considered for the position. The
investigation should determine if any formal appoint-
ment was made, and if one was, what Kappel’s qualifica-
tions for the position are——other than being a good buddy
of-Robert Olson. ' ’

0 Has the dean been “.pressured," as Glew, claims, to
rebuild the basic sciences departments because of concerns

- listed in a 1981 report by theALiason Committee on Medi-
cal Education (LCME), the medical school accrediting
agency? Whether or not such a determination would fall
under the jurisdiction of the affirmative action office, it
would be interesting to see if.the dean is more concerned
with adhering to the LCME report than he is with main-
tainingia quality school of medicine.

At this point in time, an investigation by any university
body into the internal procedures of the medical school
would prove to be a valuable experience. Charges by
Robert Glew, medical students and outside observers that
the medical school is operating with less than a full deck
seem to have been going on for quite some time with little
official action. Now seems like as good a time as ever

- to begin.

(Editor’s note: The following is
an excerpt of remarks made by Pitt
economics professor Richard
Thorn, director of Pitt’s.Economic
Policy Institute, before a recent
unemployment and recession
seminar sponsored by the Allegh-
eny County Democratic Comm-
ittee

By RICHARD THORN

I believe I was invited here to
give some perspective on president
Reagan's economic program. This
is not an'easy thing to do for a

program that has become so

incrusted with emotionally
charged rhetoric such as“‘supply
side economics " and the “new
federalism.“

I know, we all wish the president I

success in his economic program
since it is our success. I would like
final few moments to -give you my
appraisal of the outlook for Presi-
dent Reagan’s program.

First, a few words about “supply
side" economics. Supply side eco-
nomics. was an invention of a few
Madison Avenue-oriented econo-
mists and journalists, which was
adopted by the Republican party to
justify its programs which were not
essentially economic but political.

Alfred Marshall, the famous
English econ()mist., in trying to
explain the relationship between
supply and demand said they are
like two blades of a scissor: one can-
not say which one is doinggthe cut-
ting, l)ut it is obvious neither can
do the job alone.

It may be true in the recent past
that too much attention had been
paid to demand management poli-

‘ cies to the detriment of the consid-

erations governing supply; now we
may have erred too far in the other
direction. Many of the measures
President Reagan has proposed,
and in many cases enacted, such as
accelerated depreciation and tax
cuts for business, will have a posi-
tive effcct in the long-run. How-
ever, there is nothing in the
President's program that will take
us out of the current recession. The
economy is due for a recovery. In
fact, if the president had done
nothing the economy would prob-
ably be further along the path to
recovery than it is now._
However, the problem lies not in
the reforms the president has made
l)ut in the manner in which he has
done them. His tax cuts (lid
nothing to stimulate final demand
and the president missed a golden
oppportunity to codify the income

-law so as to close its loopholes

which reduce economic efficiency.
High real interest rates have offset
any stimulus ta.\ cuts may have
given to business investrncnt.

Unfortunately, I have the
unpleasztnt task of informing you
that President Rc;tgan‘s economic
program, as it is presently consti-
tuted; is doomed to failure—-not for
what the president has done but for
what he has not done.

The combination of a large
budget deficit and a tight money
supply are like oil and water——they
don't mix.

We have witnessed in recent
weeks the paradox that whenever
the Federal Reserve System
increases the money supply, inter-
est rates rise because of business-

_men's fears that the inflationary .

fires will be rekindled. Every time
monetary policy is tightened, inter-
est rates also rise because of the
high demand for credit. It is a no-
win situation.

The president has said he
intends to co.n‘tinue t.o forge ahead
with his policies—-but unfortu-
nately for the nation, the economy
is going"downhill into a brick wall.

One does not have to be a liberal .

Keynesian economist to know
what is wrong with the president's
economic policy—-in fact one only
has to be a Republican fiscal con-
servative.

The answer is to reduce the fed-
eral budget deficit and to_ increase
the supply of money. A

We cannot have a rigorous re-
covery with the present high level
of interest rates.

To askthat the money supply be
increased is not to oppose a “tight
money” policy. I am for a “tight
money” policy but not a “super

tight money_" policy that does not-

allow for growth in the real
economy.

I now come to the topic of the
“new federalism." To understand
what- is wrong with it we have to
understand the origin of the old
federalism. The old federalism
arose because some states—-no mat-
ter how much an effort they
made-could not supply essential
services to their citizens. Mississip-
pi, before World War II,. spent a
higher percentage of its state

Supply SiideEssentia||yPo|itiCa‘|_

income on ‘education than Penn- "

s_lyvania, but it had the lowest
expenditure ‘per capita on educa-
tion in the nation.

The situation is what the “old
federalism" sought to cure. As the
income , disparities between the '
states have diminished, opportun-'
ity for reducing the role of the fed- V
eral government in the nation has
risen. However, to abandon corn-
pletely the role of the federal
government in redistributing the
fiscal income of the nation-.-‘much
of it based on the fortuitiousdistri-
bution of‘ minerals and natural
resources—is foolhardy.

The national disgrace of pov-
erty, some of it as bad as anything

that exists in Poland or the IISSR,»-£9

will never be eliminated by a corn-
bination of “trickle down" and pri-
vate charity. There are some
responsibilities that a government
of western democracy cannot rid
itself of. 4

In stunrnary, to reap the benefits
of the programs that President
Reagan has undertaken it will be
necessary to reduce the federal
government's record-breaking
budget deficit, largely through tax
increases and to increase the rzite of
growth of the money supply suffi-
ciently to allow for a rapid recovery
in the economy. And lastly, the fcd— a

feral government must recognize

only the benefits of increasing the

responsibilities of state and loci":

governments but also the litnita- I
tion of this process. The founding
fathers rejected, after rntrch debate
and expermentation, the idea of a
confederation of state governments
and in their wisdom recognized

’ there" were some responsibilities

which could only be discharged by
a federal government. After more
than 200 years of-history‘, this idea
still seems to be a valid one.

Students Haveonly
Themselves to Blame.  

Dear Editor:

If students are looking for some-
one to blame for the recent-cuts in
student aid, then they should take a
long hard look in the rnirror.yWe
have only ourselves to blame.

The University of Pittsburgh
demonstrated its apathy on Friday,
March l9th, when only 200 of Pitt's
30,000 students turned out for the
Student Government Board’s

‘forum on the cuts in student aid.

This forum was arranged to give
students an opportunity to voice
their opinions to representatives of
federal, state and local govern-
ment. This was your chancc to
have your opinions heard by the
people who decide how money is
spent. But when less than one per-
cent of a group of people who are
being greatly affected by these cuts
show up at the rally. the legislators
can only think that we don't care!

People in office will choose poli-‘(if

cies that’ will do the least amount of
damage to their “constituency”. If
we as students continue to demon-
strate this degree of apathy on
issues‘ that affect us directly, their
we will always be a group that leg-
islators will not worry about and
count among their “constituency".
In the future this means that we
will be one of the first groups to be
affected when it comes to trim the
“far” out of the federal budget.
We must all get involved and

voice our opinions to representa-
tives through petitions, letters.
phone calls and especially our
votes. If wefail to do this, then “’
our future is out of our hands.‘ A "

Pitt’s Shirk Un-Paralleled At Nationals

By BRIAN BALK

When gymnast Lisa Shirk sets a
goal she is apt to achieve it.

“For this year, I guess, my main
goal would be to win (the uneven)
bars,” Shirk said last week in refer-

"i'ience to this year’s NCAA Women’s

National Gymnastics Champion-
ships at Salt Lake City, Utah. On
Saturday, Shirk got what she
wanted.

Knowing that the All—Around
title would be somewhat incon-
ceivable for her to win, due to a lack
of practice time, Shirk decided to
focus most of her energy‘ on her
most solid event, the uneven bars.
With a fine seeding and an advan-
tageous rotation schedule, Shirk
posted an excellent score of 9.45 on

A Friday to advance her to the uneven

bars finals on Saturday night.

All the judges would have had to

do for Saturday’s competition was

~ﬁVZllC1'l a videotape of Friday’s per-

formance and edit out some minor
errors. Shirk’s second performance
was better than her original, for she
achieved the evening's best score of
9.55 to emerge the national cham-
pion on the uneven bars with a
combined score of 19.00.

“It made my season worthwhile
and I accomplished the goal I
wanted to,” Shirk said yesterday.

This is the first time in the Lady

Qualifying Effort Saps Pitt for NCAAs  

By SEAN ‘BARNES

The Pitt men’s swim team
returned home yesterday from the
three-day NCAA Nationals in Mil-
waukee. Pitt’s two national quali-
fying seniors, ‘Rick Carter and
Sandy Pidgeon, did not gain the
All-America Top 12 status_which
they worked so hard for all season.

“Many of all the nationalists
from around theicountry had to do
their lieftime best times just to
qualify under the stiff cutoff times
for this year," said Pitt Head Coach

,. .d Lewis. “We were like this and
therefore didn’t improve much by
the taper between Easterns and
Nationals.”

Pitt sent eight men in nine of
National’s 18 events this year. Car-
ter was entered in five of these,
including all three relays as
anchorman, and the two individ-
ual events, 50- and 100-yard free-

  
 
    

Panther gymnastics history that a
Pitt woman gymnast has won a
national title. Shirk came
extremely close last year when she
was barely edged out for the all-
around title by Sharon Jiapiro of
UCLA.

Shirk qualified for the NCAA
Championships for her second-
place finishin the all-around at the
Eastern Regional Championships.
At Nationals this weekend, she
fared as well as she expected with a
respectable 17th place score of
35.60 in the all-around. In Friday’s
competition she scored a 9.05 on
the vault, an 8.65 on the balance
beam and an8.45 on the floor
exercise.

Shirk’s somewhat low finish in
the all-around, compared to last
year’s second place showing, did
not affect her because, she said yes-
terday, she accomplished what she
concentrated on doing—winning
the uneven bars. An ‘early-season
ankle operation kept her out of the
gym for about a month—a layoff
that many gymnasts could not
rebound from so emphatically.

Winning this crown is an ironic
‘turnaround for this talented gym-
nast. When she arrived at Pitt she
initially thought “I’ll never work
bars again." Being accustomed to
her AMF uneven bars‘ at her old

mntinued on page thirteen

style events. This was the most
events in which a Panther
swimmer has qualified in years.
But it was dissappointing when it
was all over, for Carter’s fast times
had not achieved All-America
ranking in any of the five events.

Senior teammate Pidgeon had
similar results in his three events.
Even a full three second cutdown
off his Eastern-record time in the
400-yard individual .medley was
not enough to place him in the
Top 12. Unlike Carter, who has
hung up his swim suit as he gradu-
ates in April, Pidgeon will con-
tinue training for the World
Games to be held in Equador in
July.

“I was glad to send six under-
classmen,” said Lewis. “The three
freshmen we sent now realize that
its onethingto qualify and another
thing to place at Nationals. It was
the first Nationals for‘ all six of
them and their experience will add
greatly to the team next_ year."

Pitt sophomore Lisa Shirk became the first gymnast in Lady Panther history to win a

national title. Shirk won the championship in the uneven bars Saturday

Next year’s cutoffs will be slower
since 18th place of the previous
year determines that cutoff time.
This year’s slowed down most of
the standards.

“The pressure was high just. to
beat the National cutoffs again
after the regionals,” said Lewis.
“Only three new records were
established and only by about 100-
milliseconds.”

, Pitt had to scratch Ed Bergan,
their entry in the 200-yard back-

stroke on Saturday, when the fresh- ,

man developed a bad stomach flu

‘during the course of the three-day

meet. He was dissatisfied overall
with his other two times, but for
Bergan, the experience of compet-

ing, like freshmen nationalistsjEd ‘

I..aNoue and Greg Murphy, will
add‘ immensely to their three
remaining years of college swim-
ming at Pitt. ’

Shrug off the worry about the
tough schedule, dismiss the
recent “jinx" on No.11 ranked
football teams and Coach
Jackie Sherrill’s pocketlining
move to Texas A 8c M—the only
thing Pitt‘s new head football
coach Foge Fazio need fear are
the expectations.

As spring football practice
begins today at Pitt Stadium,
Fazio inherits a team favored to
finish the nation’s best by Janu-
ary, a team for which the likeli-
hood of perfection is supposed

more a real than ideal
achievement.
As senior defensive tackle

Dave Puzzuoli said Friday, “To
lose one game next year is really
going to fall beneath our goals.

Fazio Likes No. 1 Role

Winning it all is everything.”

If such uncompromising
demands crease other men’s
brows, Fazio at least takes solace
in the notion that the main
threat to waylay Pitt on the
thorny route to the national
championship are the Panthers
themselves. And that, above all,
is Foge Fazio's job—-to make
sure that they don’t.

“It’s a challenge. We have to
guard against ‘senioritis' and
overconfidence. But, _the only
way we're going to be stopped is
if we stop ourselves,” Fazio said
at Friday's press luncheon. “We
realize that we have to be pre-
pared. Being prepared will
include...not taking it easy or
resting on our laurels."

Voted E WL

Freshman
Of The Year

Pitt wrestler Doug Haines,
the only freshman to win a
match at this year's NCAA Na-
tional Championship tourna-.
ment, has been named the 1982
Freshman of the Year by the
Eastern Wrestling League.

Haines record this season was
only 8-8‘-2 while competing in
three different weight classes for
Pitt. But oncehe settled into the
l50~pound spot at the EWL
Tournament, the freshman
roared to the finals, where he
pinned the defending league
champion to win the title and a
bid to Nationals.

Haines led Pitt in scoring at
the EWL Tournament with 13
points and became only the
sixth freshman to win an EWL
title in the league's seven-year
history. At the NCAA tourna-
ment, Haines was trailing 9-1
before pinning his opponent
and advancing to the next
round, where he was
eliminated. ‘ V

Haines ”outpointed Blooms- -
burg’s Torn Gibble and Clar-
ion’s Jamey Kasser and Ken
Nellis for the award, which is’
voted on by the league's eight
coaches and a media panel.

“This is a great honor for
Doug,” said,Pitt Coach Rande
Stottlemyer.  don't believe
some of the people realize just
how important he was to our
team this season. He wrestled at ‘
150, 158, and 167 pounds. In the
EWL Tournament, Doug dem-
onstrated his true ability when
it counted. He worked very -hard
and continued to improve.”

Pitt Tennis Team

Whips Duquesne

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

It was the kind of perfromance
that is talked about years from
now. _

The scene: The Pitt men's tennis
team is playing Duquesne yester-
day. Duquesne is highly touted in
the Eastern 8 and all of its palyers
are on scholarships. Pitt is one of
the worst teams in the Eastern 8
and all of its players are walk-ons.

The performance: After Pitt’s
James McDonald takes the first sin-
gles match 6—2, 6-4 in a su{P“5_e
Larry
match for Pitt.

The score is tied 1-1 and figured
2-1 in the Dukes favor, because
Pitt’s Steve Berkovitz was down
five match points in a third set tie-
breaker. And if that wasn’t bad
enough, Berkovitz is playing on an
injured leg as a result of collision
while chasing down a shot
Injured, down by five’ match
points, Berkovitz fights back. Dis-
daining head coach’s George Dif-
fenbach’s wishes to retire from the
match, Berkovitz pulls off six
straight points and wins the match,
6-3, 4-6, 7-6. ‘

“That was the turning point for
us. He was playing on one leg and
yet came back to win the match. He
won six straight points hurt, with
an enormous cramp,” Diffenbach
said.

Not only did Berkovitz’s gutty
performance put Pitt ahead 2-1, it
gave his teammates the incentive to
proceed and demolish the favored
Dukes..

_D.]. Mariano rolled to a 6-0, 6-2
win over Brian Burmanto put Pitt
ahead 3-l.

In MadAL West  

By FREDERICK BEERS

The American League West
makes a good case for an expanded
playoff picture. Five teams have a
shot at the divisional title.

The Oakland ,A’s, Chicago.

White Sox, Kansas City Royals,
California Angels and Texas
Rangers all have the talent to make
it to the top. Give a slight edge to
the A’s, whoitook it last year and
improved their roster over the

_ winter.

The A’s have solid pitching,
strong hitting and ioutfielding,
speed and depth. The infield is the
only question mark.

A five-man rotation is in order
for manager Billy_Martin’s club
because of a limitedibullpen. The

J A's staff led the majors in complete

games last‘ season. A

Steve McCatty, Matt Keough,
Rick Langford, Mike Norris and
Brian Kingman, all righthanders,

should start, although lefty Tom‘

Underwood could .crack the
rotation.

‘In the bullpen, Martin is count-
ing primarily on Dave Beard to ful-
fill his promise, along with Bob
Owchinko and Jeff Jones.

~The outfield ranks among the
best in the majors.

Speedster Ricky Henderson
(Golden Glove winner, second in
MVP voting, league leader in hits,

‘ runs and stolen bases last year) is in

left, Dwayne Murphy, another
Golden Glove winner, who hit 15
home runs last year, is in center and

.Tony Armas, AL leader in home

rm 5 with 22 last year is in right.
0 complement this outfield,

the A’s have Cliff Johnson as a

. designated hitter and have added

dependable Joe Rudi and Dan
Meyer to the roster.

In the infield, Oakland will
probably platoon at nearly every

position. At third, Mickey Klutts A

and Wayne Gros°s vie for the job. At
shortstop is Fred Stanley and Rob
Picciolo, at second will be Shooty
Babbitt and Davey Lopes and at
first, the A's have Jim Spencer.
Mike Heath will handle the bulk of

the catching, but Jeff Newman will .

also see action.

If the A’s can settle on one infield _

and improve their performance
against stronger teams, they shoud
take the division crown again.

But the Chicago White Sox will
have something to say about that.

The once lowly White Sox have
changed their image to that of a
winner by putting together a roster
of talented ballplayers.

Chicago has good pitching with

Britt Burns, Dennis Lamp, Steve
Trout and Lynn McGlothen in the
rotation, with Jerry Koosman,

. Lamar Hoyt and Kevin Hickey

coming out of 'the bullpen.

Steve Kemp, acquired from
Detroit, will join speedster Ron
LeFlore and future star Harold
Baines in the outfield.»

In‘ the infield, Tom Paciorek,
acquired from Seattle,‘ will be at
first with Tony Bernazard at
second, Bill Almon at short and
Jim Morrison at third. Carlton
Fisk will be the catcher.

Greg “Bull” Luzinski will again .

be the designated hitter.

Chicago has plenty of sock and
speed but had to forego depth and
defense to get .it. They need a year

. or two yet.

continued from huge m',,,.
out now, Pitt would certainlv

get a great measure of the votes
for the No. 1 ranking forits sea-
soned team which returns 18
starters, including eight players
who made some All-America
team last year, and Heisman
candidate, quarterback Dan
Marino. It is an insight to the
man himself that Fazio embra-
ces the favorite’s role with relish
and not the reticence of some
other coaches. I

“I can’t understand that. You
tell your guys all year to be
winners, to be dedicated and
work hard toward that goal,
and then when you get it, you
get upset,” Fazio said, some-
what increduously. “That
doesn't make sense to me.”

Common sense also tells
Fazio that even the abundance
of talent Pitt will field this fall
does not_ mitigate the need for
more hard work and more
improvement. As he said Fri-
day, “We want to go out and
teach this spring and fall. When
the time comes that they stop
learning, then that’s our (the
coaches’) problem.” ,

Another problem is the sche-
dule, which Fazio referred to as
the Panthers’ toughest in 10
years,” and alternately, as the
real reason “why Jackie (Sher-
rill) left.”,

The laughter that punctu-
_ated the last remark was soon
replaced by a rare hint of grave-
ness in Fazio’s voice. “We
should find out immediately
how we stand after those first
four games,” he added, before
reeling off a thumbnail pros-
pectus of each of the four
teams-—FIorida ‘State, North
Carolina, Illinois and West
Virginia.

But this spring, unlike last,
the outlook is considerably
more predictable for the Pan-
thers. Only four positions need
filled—-fullback, linebacker,
cornerback and center——and in
all cases Pitt returns several
able, experienced candidates.

At the cornerback slot vacated
by Pappy Thomas, junior Troy

Hill ranks as a shoo-in, for both

his experience and speed. At the

linebacker position formerly
. played by Sal Sunseri, the three
leading candidates are sopho-
more Caesar Aldisert, sopho-
more Troy Benson and senior
Yogi Jones, who returns to
action after a redshirt season
last year. _

At fullback, junior Bill Beach
is the early frontrunner, but he
should get a stiff challenge from
junior Marc Bailey and sopho-
more Marlon Mclntyre, who

235-pound junior Jim Sweeney

rank as the likely two choices to
win All-America Emil Boures’

former spot. For insurance,

Fazio has switched middle
guard Chris Davis to center this
_spring. Fazio has not ruled out

the possibility of also moving

either Rob Fada or Ron Sams,..
both starting guards, to center if

he is not pleased with the play

there.

According to the first-year,“

coach, the team’s other major
concern is the kicking game.
Last year's punter Dave Heplerf
will miss all of spring practice
as he continues to recover from
knee surgery. Heplerminjured
his knee badly in the Penn State
game.

If he can’t return to form by
fall, the punting job will be left

up to either Greg Gamer, who ‘

replaced Hepler in the Sugar
Bowl, Tony Recchia or new-
comer Chris,Jelic, a freshman
from Mount Lebanon. Quarter-
back Dan Marino will also do
some occasional punting,
according to Fazio.

With those question marks“

aside, the major task facing
Fazio and his staff is the honing
and teaching ,which begins
again today——a job the new
headmaster says he approaches
“anxiously and enthusi-
astically.”

Or, as tight end John Brown
put it, “I’ve been here three
years and we've gone ll-l and
been second-ranked twice’.
Maybe this is the year."

The facts would seem to sug-
gest so.

PITT NOTES: Several players
will miss or see limited action
during spring drills, including:

4*;

Bob Brown, out with kneelﬁhif

surgery; Greg Christy, limited
practice due to knee surgery; Al
Wenglikowski, limited practice
due to ankle surgery; and Fada, .
who may see limited acfion due
to a sore knee....The other posi-
tion switch Fazio will try this
spring is sophomore Bob Law-
son, who moves to tight end
from strong safety....Practices
will run every Monday, Wed-
nesday and Friday—weather
permitting—from 4 to 6 p.m.
and Saturday from 1:30 to 3:30
p.m. through April 10. After a
one-week break for finals, prac-
tice begins on a daily
from 3 to 5 p.m., April 2l-30.

The annual spring game will be

played May I at 1:30 p.m. at Pitt
Stadium.

‘Shirk Wins

‘Glass all other competitors with her

ﬂuilding Championships and now

continued from page nine
practice gym, Shirk found it diffi-
cult to make the adjustment to the
Nissan equipment Pitt uses.

But through hours of dedicated
workout time, Shirk made the
adjustment well enough to now
say, “I don't know why I liked my
old bars. I love our bars now. I
don't know what I would do with
any other kind.”

Shirk, one of the strongest gym-
nasts in the nation, was able to out-

almost flawless routine.

“After bars, I felt this is my place
to shine. It could have gone either
way, but I must have come
through,” Shirk said.

Shirk regularly executes her
uneven bars routine with a fluent
style that works with the uneven
bars instead of against them.
Reaching the elite level that Shirk
has has earned her All-America sta-
tus for the second consecutive year.

March has been a month of firsts
for Shirk. She achieved a first at the
Eastern Regional Championships
on the uneven bars, a first at the
Pittsburgh Collegiate Body-

'a first place on the uneven bars at
the NCAA Women's National
Championships.

“First" suits Shirk perfectly. ~

outstanding relay split of 49.8 in
his four-lap leg of the butterfly of
Pitt's 400-yard medley relay.
Emore’s taking the pressure of
Pitt's No. l butterflyer and taking
it to Nationals in just one year, is
both a credit to his tough workouts
and Lewis’ coaching.

Sophomore J.D. McCrillis and
junior Jerry Zaleski also gained
from Nationals, although not plac-
ing Top I2 in either of Pitt’s two
freestyle relays. Both will be leaders
on next year's team, as three-time
National qualifier. Pidgeon, and
four-time qualifier Carter, gradu-
ate this year. ’

Pitt’s return of six nationalists
will be the most any Eastern team
will return for next season. This,
coupled with a good crew of
incoming freshmen, could easily
put Pitt back on top in the East for
next year. Coach Lewis knows his
returning nationalists’ value to his
team and looks forward to a quality
recruiting program both on the
local as well as out-of-state scenes.

' The Pitt News, Monday, March 29, I982

Anybody Can Win Wild, Even AL West  

continued from page eleven
several years, yet they can't seem to
get things together. On paper, the

' Angels should have won this divi-

sion with regularity. Instead
they’ve floundered with regularity.

The batting lineup is awesome,
but the pitching is suspect. Either
way though, .the Angels’ fortunes
will rise or fall with those of Reggie
Jackson. A good year by Jackson
could help overcome the weak
pitching.

Jackson will serve as the right-
fielder, with Fred Lynn in _center
and Brian Downing in left. Don
Baylor's bat in the designated hitter
spot should complement Jackson's
nicely. I

_ The infield will have the amaz-

' ing Rod Carew at first, Bobby

Grich at second, Rick Burleson at
short and newly acquired Doug
DeCinces at third. Former Pirate

Ed Ott will see most of the action I

behind the plate, with newly-

acquired Bob Boone seeing an

occasional start.

Ken Forsch __leads' the starting
rotation, which inlcudes Geoff
Zahn, Mike Witt, Steve Renko,
Bruce Kison, Bill Travers and

Angel Moreno, who has been com- -

pared to Fernando Valenzuela.

In the bullpen, manager Gene
Mauch has Don Aase and Andy
Hassler.

The Kansas City Royals aren't
much better in the pitching depart-

.ment. Beyond starters Larry Gura

and Dennis Leonard and reliever
Dan Quisenberry, manager Dick
Howser has big problems on_the
mound.

Howser must chose whether to
bring Paul Splittorf back out of the
bullpen to start again or to go with

young, untested Altee Hammaker

or Keith Creel. Or Howser could
hope for the continued improve-
ment of Jim Wright or take Renie
Martin out of his accustomed spot
in the bullpen to shore up his
rotation. I .

And if he chooses to take from

the bullpen, what will happen to_

the Royals relief pitching?
Things, fortunately, look better
in Kansas City's everyday lineup.
The Royals have superstar
George Brett returning to third,
Frank White at second,‘ U.L.

~Washington at short, Wi-llie Aik/-A

ens at first and John Wathan
behind the plate. it's a solid infield
and combines well with an outfield
of Willie Wilson, Amos Otis and
Jerry Martin._ .
There is enough speed and depth
here, but this is.not the club it was
two, three and four years ago. J
Neither are the Texas Rangers.
They are better, though not quite
good enough to take the AL We
flag. '
The Rangers are in desperate
needof two outfielders, to flank
Mickey Rivers in center, and some
additional hitting, to go along
with designated hitter Al Oliver
and third baseman Buddy Bell,
who is considered by many to be
the best all-around player in the
league. '

The starting rotation should be
composed of George “Doc"
Medich, Rick Honeycutt, Charlie
Hough and Frank Tananna, while
Steve Comer and Jon Matlack
could also start. In the bullpen,
manager Don Zimmer will have
Danny Darwin, John Henry John-
son and several rookies. ’

In the infield, Pat Putnam or
Lamar Johnson will be at first,
Doug Flynn at second, Mark
Wagner at short, Bell at third and
Jim Sundberg behind the plate.

The designated‘ hitter spot
should go to the loser of the battle
at first base.

And while these five teams are
battling for the division crown, the
Minnesota Twins and Seattle
Mariners will battle to see which
team avoids the cellar.

The Twins are undergoing a
youth movement. As manyas four
rookies could crack the starting
line-up.

‘ Among them are third baserrian

WANT To KILL AGCONVERSATION?

Hrbek and outfielders Steve Doug-
lass and Randy Johnson.

Gaetti and Hrbek should join
returnees Roy Smalley at short,
Rob Wilfong at second and Butch.
Wynegar behind the plate.

Douglass and Johnson could
join Gary Ward, Mickey Hatcher
and Dave Engle, among other can-
didates in the outfield.

The pitching rotation should
consist of Pete \Redfern, Roger
Erickson, Brad Havens and Darrell
Jackson, while the bullpen features
Doug Corbett and Bobby Castillo

While the Twins’ outlook 

gloomy,the Mariners’ is even more
dismal. J

The Mariners lost the league's
No. 2 hitter, Tom Paciorek, as well
as slugger Jeff Burroughs and Dan
Meyer.

That leaves the fate of the Marin-
er's hinging on designated hitter
Richie Zisk and leftfielder Bruce

I Boch te.

After Zisk and Bochte, the
Mariners have a lot of hope, but not '

a whole lot of proven talent.

Rookie Jim Maler and Gary
Gray will vie for the job at first,
with Julio Cruz at second,,Todd
Cruz at short and Lenny Randle at”
third. I 

Besids Bochte in left, the Marin-
ers have question marks for the
other outfieldtpositions.

On the mound,- manager Rene
Lachemann has Floyd Bannister,
Glenn Abbott and Jim Beattie, as
well as a host of young prospects.

In the bullpen, Shane Rawly and

Larry Anderson are the mainstays.
Catching will be the responsibi-'

lity of Jim Essian. . A

The Mariners will be hard
pressed to duplicate their perfor-
mance of last season (sixth place
overall). A more likely scenario is
that they will once again return to
the depths of the American League
West. I J ~
