On Dec. 1, A&E History Channel will
showcase "Homelands Remembered," the story
of the nationality rooms at the University of
Pittsburgh, to 11.5 million viewers.

The program will honor the history of the
nationality rooms and how they are used at Pitt.

The idea of the nationality rooms began in
1921 when then-Chancellor John Gabbert
Bowman envisioned expanding the campus by
building a monument dedicated to education —
the Cathedral of Learning. At a time of ﬁnancial
deﬁcit, Bowman needed the support of the local
working-class communities to build the soaring
tower. .
In 1925, Bowman met with Duquesne mill
workers and families to explain his dream of
building special classrooms as tributes to the ~
people who came from abroad to help build
Pittsburgh. Bowman explained to local commu-
nities that their "children and grandchildren
would learn to shape the future in a setting that
would celebrate their past."

As donations began to trickle in, Chancellor
Bowman and Ruth Crawford Mitchell, a sociol-
ogy professor, created the Nationality Rooms
Program and its founding principles. A national-
ity room was to be designed in the traditions of
a nation recognized as such by the United States
Department of State.

To capture the enduring values of each cul-
ture, nationality rooms were to be constructed in
a style prior to 1787 — before the University of
Pittsburgh was founded and the year in which
the United States Constitution was adopted.
Emphasis of any given historical. period was to

Rooms’ page 3 was completed and dedicated the summer of 1996.

"There is a place within us that has all‘ the
answers. Meditation is a way of empty-
ing our minds and tapping into these intu-
itive powers."

She says the most important aspect .

of meditation is maintaining slow, deep
breathing to the lower abdomen, called
diaphragmatic breathing.

She adds the best way to describe
diaphragmatic breathing is to picture a
balloon in your stomach.

"When you inhale, you want to bring
the breath low, and ﬁll up the balloon by
expanding, your abdomen," said Barr.
"When you exhale, you are deﬂating the
balloon. Remember to only move the
abdomen, though, and not the shoulders
or chest." 1

Dr. Goldie Edwards, director of the
tension control classes, says it is impor-
tant for students to practice meditation,
especially if the stressors in their life
inﬂuence their health or cause them to
make poor lifestyle choices, such as
excessive drinking or drug use.

"All people and students report
stress, and we do need a certain amount
of stress for our health," said Edwards.
"It's just learning how to quiet the mind
and body by balancing and disengaging
from stress."

FROM PAGE 1

Edwards offers some simple medita-
tion methods:

—- Body scanning: Focus on differ-
ent parts of the body and feel the heart-
beat in those areas.

"This is great when you want to fall

asleep and you have so many thoughts

going through your head," said Josh
Heynes, a senior.

— Muscle progression: Learn how
to save energy when using your muscles.

‘'1 use this when I weight lift," said
Greg Delcollo, a senior. "When I work
my quad, that is what I focus on. I try not
to squinch the muscles in my face."

—— Visualization: Imagine yourself
in a serene setting. 4

"When you do this, you don't even
need acid," said Delcollo.

ACUPUNCTURE
After years of repeated treatment
from doctors, antibiotics and steroids for

her bronchial arthritis, Susan Gillis grew 

tired of the short—term results. ,
As a dancer, she didn't have the timg
or patience for the shortness of breath. 
She decided to opt for another
method of healing. She chose the 2,000-
year-old practice of Chinese acupunc-
rture.

be cultural and aesthetic, not political.
The design and funding of the nation-
ality room was the responsibility of the

"individual committee. To ensure its

authenticity of design, most of the archi-
tects and the designers of the rooms were
native to that particular country.

Athenian artist Demetrios Kokotsis
came to Pittsburgh to hand paint the plas-
ter ceiling in the traditional method of
encaustic or wax painting.

The Polish nationality committee
brought Waclaw Symborski from Cracow,
Poland to decorate the ornate ceiling of the
Polish Room. Mitchell brought a dozen
eggs every morning to the Cracow artist to
mix with the traditional temperate paints.

The minimum cost to design and build
a nationality room was $250,000. Funding
came through such activities as picnics,
bake sales and charity dinners. For 16
years, Kennywood Amusement Park
donated the proceeds of its armual Slavic
Day to the construction of the
Czechoslovkian Room.

On average, a nationality room took a
minimum of 10 years to raise the funding,
secure the raw materials, and construct the
room. According to Maxine Bruhns, direc-
tor of the Nationality Rooms Program, the
Israeli Room took 21 years, the longest of
any of the nationality roonrs. Funding for

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE 1

the Israeli Room began in 1966 and con-
tinued through the dilfrculties of the Yom
Kippur and Six-Day War.

2 Many of the nationality committees
were forced to overcome such hardships.
Several committees came close to losing
the savings to bank foreclosure during The
Great Depression in 1929, while others
watched as their countries struggled during
World War H.

The ideals of education are reﬂected in
many of the classrooms. The German
Room reﬂects the classroom design of
Aula, Germany's oldest university. The
teacher stands at‘ a wooden platform in
front of the classroom and lectures down to
the students. In contrast, the Chinese
believed in a more democratic style of
learning, which is reﬂected in’ the con—
struction of its classroom. In Chinese soci-
ety, learning is equally shared between
teacher and student, and are all seated at a
round table.

, . Many students have their classes in
these nationality rooms. Teachers believe

that the atmosphere of these rooms is con— .
dusive to learning: history in the Austrian‘

Room, math in the German Room, politics
in the English Room.

The next two rooms to be constructed
are the Indian and Japanese Rooms, slated
to be completed by the turn of the century.

HOLISTIC

"Like most people who decide to
turn to acupuncture, I had a few doubts,"
said Gillis, who instructs yoga and dance
at Trees Hall. "But I ﬁgured it couldn't
hurt to try."

After 10 sessions of treatment from
Dr. David Mortell, she no longer experi-
enced the agony of her asthma. This was
six years ago.

"The results were dramatic," said
Gillis. "It felt so good, and I was so calm.
I didn't even have a cold for two years."

Acupuncture can treat a variety of ill-
ness, such as constipation, sports injuries,
colds and menstrual cramps by inserting
ﬁne needles into the parts of the body
which trigger the release of endorphins
— chemicals responsible for pleasure.

' "Most people think of needles and
think ‘ouch, those hurt.‘ Actually, most
feel a heavy sensation in the limbs and
feel generally relaxed," said Mortell, who
is affiliated with the Pain Center at
Shadyside Hospital.

Heynes said if he could, he would
receive acupuncture all the time.

"I dislocated both of my shoulders
from football, and I got acupuncture for
the-pain," said Heynes. "I never thought
little pins would make me feel so good."

Unfortunately, for most situations,
insurance companies do not cover the
cost of acupuncture.

"Our biggest stumbling block right
now is money," said Mortell, who
charges around $60-$70 a session.

MASSAGE ‘
After a long day of hunching over a
desk or lugging around a heavy backpack,
most of us crave for our shoulders to be
rubbed or our feet to be massaged.

And we want someone else to do it. It -

requires no effort and it feels good.
"Massage is a wonderful way to deal
with stress, " said Dr. Mary DuQuinn, a
massage instructor at Trees Hall. "There
is such an emphasis on health and healing
in our society, and studies show that peo-
ple become [more relaxed] with mas-
sage."

a student of DuQuinn, recently received a
shiatsu massage, which compares to
acupuncture but without the needles, and
felt the results were dramatic.

"I've had severe wrist pain the whole
semester, from all the writing and mas-
saging," said Walters, "so I hoped the
movements and the acupressure from the
massage would help. The first two days,
though, I felt even more pain than before,
and I was really discouraged. But when I
woke up the third day, all the pain was
gone, and I haven't had it since."

Walters says the healing may be coin-
cidental, but believes massage correlates
with the whole "mind—body experience."

"You want people to know they can
improve their immune system by opening
some energy charmels. And that's what
massage does. It opens up our meridians
and lets the energy ﬂow."

bottom line,” and borrowed concepts
which belonged in the board room
rather than in an educational facility.

“Pitt as you know, is the largest
employer in Allegheny County, and has
resorted to tactics such as downsizing
and union-busting, practiced by large
corporations,” said Lacny.

Lacny added that this “corporate-
style attitude” is not in the best inter-
ests of both undergraduate and gradu-
ate students. He said that disparity in
wages is typical corporate behavior.

“Highly paid executives, low paid
workers; sounds like a corporation to
me,” said Lacny.

Snow linked workers’ grievances
to those experienced by the COGS, an
organization of teaching assistants and
graduate teaching fellows. Snow said
that the University exploited graduate
students, making them work above the
20—hours-per-week legal limit. He
added that several graduate students
were overworked by teaching more
recitations incurred by larger class
sizes, and some were harassed by the
administration.

“Somehow, Pitt trustees heard in
board rooms of American corporations
that the only [source of] income that
matters is corporate donations,” said
Snow. '

Stabile said that she is trying to
organize mass faculty support for the
members of Local 29. She cited a cou-

FROM PAGE 1

ple of examples in which the adminis-
tration ignored faculty grievances.

“The trends across p the [United]
States suggest that universities across
the States are trying to outsource main-
tenance workers,” said Stabile.

-She added that the only way to win
a good contract for SEIU-29 members
is for students, faculty, and workers to
stand together.

“Workers at Local 29 make this
university work,” added Stabile.

Kline gave a brief history of the
American labor movement of the ‘70s
and ‘80s, and cited the recent
Teamsters‘ strike as proof that the
workers can get the wages, beneﬁts,
and contracts they deserve.

“It’s time to stand up and bring
labor’s recent victories to the
University of Pittsburgh,” said Kline.

The meeting _was well-attended, by
both students and faculty. Several
respected professors were in atten-
dance, and said that if a strike was to
occur, they had suitable off-carnpus
locations at which classes could be
held.

The SSL29 will hold a meeting on

Monday, Nov. 24, at 8 p.m. in the fifth A

ﬂoor lounge of the William Pitt Union,
to discuss this issue

Each panelist advocated that stu-
dents to get involved with the struggle,

MEDFORD, Ore. -— Okay, so it’s a
marijuana plant. But it was going to
be a Christmas tree. -

That’s what a man told a judge
yesterday in Medford, Ore.

The case started in June, when
police were called to handle a distur-
bance between a man and his wife.
The police say the couple were argu-
ing about drugs.

Officers spotted light from a
growing lamp shining through the
cracks of the family’s TV cabinet.
Inside, they found an eight inch pot
plant growing in a plastic soda bottle.

In court, the couple pleaded-

guilty to drug charges and got 18
months probation each. But the hus-
band argued he was growing the plant
to be a Christmas tree.

The judge answered, “Now your
Christmas present is being a convict-

Bettie Phillips» found the '2-
month-old deer in western Virginia
last July 3. V

Later that day, the North Carolina
woman and her daughter pierced the
fawn’s ears with two cross-shaped
earrings.

Two days later, police spotted the
deer in Phillips’ car, with inﬂamed
and infected ears.

Now, Phillips has pleaded guilty
to transporting wildlife without a per-
mit. She has to pay $250 for the cost
of treating the fawn.

The animal was released into the
wild in August.

Phillips has insisted she meant no
harm. She said, “You can get a little
kid’s ears pierced. What’s the differ-
ence between a person’s [ears] and a
baby deer’s?”

County may punish
  commuters with cuts to

  public transportation

Port Authority Transit is contemplating a fare
increase.

They’re talking about a 20-percent increase, which
would take the standard bus fare from $1.25 to $1.50,
and a monthly Zone 1 bus pass would cost $50 instead
of the current $40. ’ r

This may come about thanks to our county commis-

‘ sioners, who have proposed a $4 million budget cut for

PAT.

But it’s not just $4 million that they’d be taking
away from public transportation in Pittsburgh. The state
matches’ county funding at a 3-to-1 ration. That is, the
commissioners would also be freeing us of $12 million
in state funding, for a total of $16 million in cuts to
Pittsburgh’s public transportation.

A lot of community members rely on public trans-
portation, especially college students. ’

Many Pitt commuters have realized that it’s been
less expensive to ride a bus to school than to park in
Oakland. Many resident students use the buses on
weekends and nights to go out because they don’t have
cars on campus.

That means a lot of Pitt students would be affected

‘by such fare increases. ‘

There is no way that students won’t be affected by
a fare increase because of Pitt’s contract with PAT to
provide reduced-cost bus passes and 50—cent fares on
weekends and evenings. ’

Either students who use the buses will have to pay
more directly, or Pitt will have to pay PAT more to make
up the difference. That money won’t come out of
nowhere —— it will come from our Parking and
Transportation Fee, i.e., that fee will increase for all stu-
dents, whether they use public transportation or not.

If Pitt doesn’t make up the difference, it will still

Take part in finding cr new clean olFAS

Kris Kissel

Oplnlons Editor _

Pitt is searching for a new dean
of FAS. He or she will take the place
of Peter Koehler, who will be step-
ping down after 12 years as dean,
sometime this summer. Students
should play a part in this search,
because more than anybody else,
we will be affected by the decisions

The College of Arts and
Sciences is the undergraduate divi-
sion of FAS. Students in CAS are
subject to the cuniculurn that the
dean of ' FAS . must approve.
Undergraduates in other schools
take courses which ﬁnd their home
in FAS, and which must be coordi-
nated between deans of the schools
involved The requirements of grad-
uate programs in FAS are also sub-
ject to the dean’s approval.

A huge matter under discussion
by the University right now is an
undergraduate-curriculum review.

withwhothis nextdeanisandwhat
vision the dean will hold ofeduca-
tion in a liberal arts university.

The dean of FAS will also
decide the budget of each depart-
ment in- his school. He has to take
into account many issues with each
department, including size, enroll-
ment, quality of instruction, and

quality of research when deciding

how much money each department
is allotted.

Last spring, several depart-
ments fell under intense scrutiny
from the administration in .the
months leading up to the dean’s
budget decision. The departments’

graduate programs were investigat-

ed to determine the quality of each
program -9 infonnation which was
to be used directly in the budgeting
decision. Many people were unhap-
py because the criteria being usedin
the evaluations were kept secret.

It goes without saying that
graduate students should be con-
cerned with who has the power to
decide whether programs will expe-

Strippers,

Picking up the newspaper nowadays
can really  outto be an adventure.

Stories of deaths and sex and drugs
that seem like they have come straight out
of an episode of “Miami Vice” or the
minutes of a University of Pittsburgh

daily. »

just a few of the stupid moves that have
caught my attention as of late: V

Star who was one of the unlucky prodi-
gies who suffered the selective wrath of
the league’s substance-abuse policy, was

was even better.

Most likely in a ﬁt of chemical rage,
the former Dallas maverick was arrested

° Ron Cooper, head football coach at
the University of Louisville, is off the
hook because the real sicko who invited a
pair of strippers to the school’s 1996 golf
outing came forward.

Kevin Beck, director of the school’s
football operations, has become the latest
scapegoat for a public sports ﬁgure.

These women allegedly followed the
participantsaround the golf course serv-
ing them beer and oﬁ°en'ng to lift their
shirts and expose their breasts for money.

Cooper had originally denied allega-
tions that there were strippers present at
the alumni event, but when he was con-
fronted with pictures showing him
accompanied by obviously topless
women in both 1996 and 1997’s events,
he fessed up.

Unclersize & unnoticed, ‘tough’ Grischow centers Panther offense

Rachel Lenzi

Staff Writer

Most football fans don’t
pay much attention to the cen-
ter position, but as Walt Harris
describes it, the position
Andrew Grischow plays
means more to the offense
than just handing the football
to the quarterback.

“The center is the quarter-
back of the offensive line,”
Coach Harris said. “He has to
make all the calls and direct
all the blocking assignments
whether it be runbacks or pass
protections, so he has a major
part mentally as well as phys-
ically.”

Grischow defines “center”
in his own terms.

“I think the position
receives a lot of credit from
the coaches, because they
understand that sometimes it’s
difficult because you have to
find out different things than
the other offensive linemen
do. You have to understand
what formation the defense is
in, and you have to understand
where certain players are on
the defense.”

In his three years at Pitt,

If you think the MCAT
is just about

memorizing science,
we’ve got a bridge
we’d like to sell you.

 

Grischow has fallen into his
position well. When asked to
analyze the center position, he
gives a two-way explanation
of his role.

“It’s a good position to be
in because you get a chance to
look at the whole defense, and
with the good offensive
scheme we have you can read
the defense and find out which
players you have to block.”

After a stellar career at
Warren J. Harding High
School in Warren, Ohio,
Grischow came to Pitt in the
fall of 1994 with high acade-
mic and athletic accolades.
However, Grischow endured
the trying transition from
tackle to center and from high
school to college.

“My freshman year was
difficult,” the 22-year-old
admits. “I was in a totally new
environment at center, I had
never played it before, except
maybe when I was in seventh
grade playing in junior high
school, but when I came to
Pittsburgh it was very hard to
adjust here.”

Academically, Grischow
made a smooth transition to
college, majoring in commu-

nications. As a freshman, he
earned Bell Atlantic Scholar
Athlete Honors and was
named to the Athletics
Director’s Honor Roll. But
after spending a redshirt sea-
son learning the Panther
offense, his development as a
player and as a center has paid
off extremely well.

Grischow has started
every game at center as part of
the new West Coast offense. It
is one of the best offenses in
the Big East, anchored by a
powerful offensive line which
Grischow credits for its cohe-
siveness.

“We have a solid offen-
sive line right now. We all
communicate and talk well.
No one sits there and argues,
and if we don’t understand
what’s going on, we talk
through it.” '

Harris, in his first year of
working with his starting cen-
ter and the offensive line, has
seen progress in Grischow’s
game.

“I think he’s improved his
play this year quite a bit,”
Harris says. “He is a fierce
competitor and a very compet-
itive guy who likes to play

has started in every Pitt Panther game so far this year.

that’s why he’s been able to
play even though he’s not very
big as most centers go.”
What Grischow lacks in
size he makes up for with
tenacity. “Tough,” he

responds, when asked to char-
acterize his game. “That’s the
only thing I can say. Ever
since I’ve been here at
Pittsburgh we’ve played tough

Rivalries galore for M

Quick, what’s the best rivalry in col-
lege football? I don’t know either, but no
matter which matchup you pick, it’s play-
ing this week. Unfortunately, Pitt’s
“Backyard Brawl” against West Virginia is
next week, but there are lots of trash-talk-
ing, hate-spewing games to hold us over.

Virginia Tech at Pitt (+11)

Pitt has never beaten the Hokies, and
that doesn’t ﬁgure to change this year. The
more Pitt plays, the more it looks like the
same‘ old Panthers. Pitt has looked very
good at times, but it really hasn’t played
four consecutive quarters of football since
the Miami game. Pitt will need four good
quarters to beat Virginia Tech; it won’t get
them. _

Virginia Tech 38, Pitt 30

Ohio State (+3 1/2) at Michigan .

The Buckeyes couldn’t beat Michigan '

for the last few years when they had the

talented squad, things could really get ugly.
Several Ohio State receivers started the war
of words as early as this Monday. Do they

Panthers suffered no major injuries
to starters last week.

The team did suffer two injuries
late in the Syracuse game, though.
Tight end/defensive end John Jones

“Defensively we’ve played

By the numbers, Virginia Tech

Tech is 1-4 under Beamer in road
games following bye weeks.

The Hokies buried Syracuse
earlier this season 31-3 at home
and destroyed Arkansas State 50-
O. _

But the team suffered tough
losses to underrated Miami of
Ohio (24-17) and to West Virginia
(30-17).

Still, Beamer has been opti-
mistic about the season.

“We’ve played fairly well for
the most part, lost to Miami of
Ohio, West Virginia, and had a
couple of breakdowns,” Beamer
said. “We are lucky to be where
we are.” 1

The Hokies may also be look-
ing past the Panthers to a tough
match against intrastate rival
Virginia on the Nov. 29. But, the
same could be said about the
Panthers, who have their storied
matchup with West Virginia set for
the same date.
