occupy protest

One ﬁnal it rally ended four

Instead of clearing out of camp

Pitt Democrats touse$2,0llll in donations for 2012 campaigns

. By Zoe, Owutsky
Staﬂ” Writer

The Pitt College Democrats have

a larger war chest for this fall’s ,
elections after two local politi— — '

cians made personal donations
to the group.

In the fall, U.S. Rep. Mike

Doyle, D—Pa., spontaneously
donated $1,000 to the club at
one of its meetings. Allegheny
County Executive Rich Fitzger-
ald pledged to donate $1,000 if
elected this past November. Stay-
ing true to his word, Fitzgerald
made out a check to the Pitt Col-
lege Democrats at their meeting

last Tuesday. 0

“This is one of the largest
donations we’ve ever received,”
Pitt’College Democrats president
Lara Sullivan said. -

Sullivan said the club has re-

ceived smaller donations as a
result of donation requests its
members have sent to politi-
cians in the past, but she would
not provide speciﬁc amounts or
names of donors. -

She said that the organization
plans on using the money, in part,
to campaign for Doyle’s and Pres-
ident Barack Obama’s re—election
campaigns this November.

Matt DiFiore, who was presi-
dent of the Pitt College Demo-

crats when Doyle and Fitzgerald
announced their donations in
late September, said that the two
politicians were impressed by the
student turnout at the meetings,
the energy of the organization
and its participation in the candi-
dates’ campaigning.

Neither Fitzgerald nor Doyle
responded to multiple calls for
comment on the donations.

After the September meeting
at which Doyle made his dona-
tion, the organization worked on
Fitzgerald’s campaign for Allegh-
eny County executive, and Went
door to door in Pittsburgh during
the weeks leading up to his elec-

_tion.

DiFiore said that Doyle at-
tended several of the group’s
meetings this academic year be-

cause the group is helping him

get the signatures he needs to get

on the ballot for the election in

November. .

As the campaign season gears
up, the Pitt College Democrats
planlto work closely with the
regional director of the Obama
campaign in Pittsburgh, helping

the campaign out with various '

events, canvassing and register-
ing student voters.

In the past, the group has
worked for the campaign group
Students for Barack Obama, and
it currently has plans to further

work with Obama’s local cam-
paign, register student voters
and keep people informed on is-
sues relevant to the election.

The Pitt College Republicans
have received similar donations
in the past year.

. Pitt College Republicans pres-
ident Casey Rankin said that last
spring Allegheny County Coun-
cilmember Heather‘ Heidelbaugh
donated $500 to the club, and the
Republican Committee of Allegh-
eny County gave $250.

Rankin said that the Pitt Re-
publicans also have plans to col-
lect signatures and go door to

Pitt’s humor publication, The
Pittiful News, will get a make-
over on Feb. 24 when it makes the
move to newsprint.

The switchover from 8 and
1/2—by-11-inch computer paper to

newsprint — the low-cost paper '

commonly used for news publi-
cations — is part of a new direc-
tion for The Pittiﬁil News. Edi-
tor-in-chief and club president
Kelsey Henke is spearheading
the change, which will include ar-
ticles more orientedtoward news
commentary, a monthly rather
than weekly publication schedule
and an attempt to be self-funded
by advertisement revenue:

“For a long time people
wouldn’t pick up the paper be-
cause they didn’t_' know it was a
paper,”_ Henke said.

She hopes the move to news-
print will help students see the
newspaper as more legitimate.

She "said the injunction is nec-

Ron Gruendl, a BNY Mellon
spokesman, declined to comment
on the eviction of the Occupiers
from the bank’s property.

Most of the Occupiers were _

willing to leave the camp peace-
fully.

comprises 32 writers, is gener-
ally a humor publication, but it
also prints serious stories and
editorials. Henke leaves it almost
completely up to the writer to de-

cide in what direction to take his '

or_ her work.
Currently, the paper circulates

200 copies every Friday in Tow- -

ers Lobby. The staff leaves any
copies that don’t get picked up in

_ other locations around campus,

such as the William Pitt Union or
Hillman Library.

A $900 allocation from the
Student Government Board facil-
itated the switch to publishi'ng'o‘n
newsprint, and that money will
be used to cover three months
of printing costs. The group has
not yet decided where it will dis-
tribute the 750 copies printed the
last Friday of each month.

Currently, The Pittiful News
writers are free to submit work
as they ﬁnish it, but that might
change too. Wills Butler, the pa-
per’s senior editor, said the pub-
lication’s organizers plan to start
giving the staff assignments.

Amidst rumors circulating
Monday night that police would
forcibly remove any remaining
protesters at MellonGreen, no po-
lice were on the scene as of 8 p.m. _

About 50 people remained. at
the campsite on Monday night, as
a number of tents that have been
in place since Oct. 15 still stood in
their places. '

Weido, 20 and currently‘ un-
employed, said most people in
the camp were leaving because
they could not afford to get ar-
rested at the current juncture in
their lives. -

The Occupiers remained opti-
mistic despite the eviction.’ They
gathered for a press conference
at noon, chanting together, “You
cannot evict an idea.”

During the conference, the
members of the movement said
they considered the 115 days
spent at the park a victory and
will continue to organize in and
occupy other areas in Pittsburgh.

During the ﬁnal rally and press
conference, one Occupier carried

“The biggest problem is get-
ting people who are dedicated,”
Butler said. “People have other
‘work to do, and obviously we’re
not paying anybody.”

Henke said she’s loyally stuck

I with the The Pittiﬁil News since

1

last fall because of the freedom
the paper allows her.‘
“I can write whatever I want,

and I like to take things in some

pretty bizarre directions,” Henke
said, noting a recent short, news-
style piece she wrote about a
group of local punks who started
making greeting cards with ma-
terials like chicken-blood ink and
the tears of the weak.

Although The Pittiful News is
going in a more serious direction,

. Butler made it clear that the writ-

ers wouldn’t lose their laid-back
attitudes.

“The_paper’s supposed to be
entertaining,” Butler said. “Re—
gardless of what we’re covering,
we’ll have the humor element
above all.”

Emily Croushore, a Pittiful

News staff writer, said the re-

A a sign that read, “You can remove

my tent, but I’ll never lose the
sense of home I found here.”

A series of Occupiers spoke to
the crowd, led chants, sang songs
and told their stories.

“I gave up my apartment and
made this place my home,” Helen
Gerhardt, 45, said to the crowd.
“Home is wherever Occupy is.”

Gerhardt has beenwith Occupy
Pittsburgh since Nov. 1. A Veteran
of the Iraq War, Gerhardt said that
Occupy Pittsburgh was where she
served now, and she urged her fel-
low Occupiers not to give up.

“We will lose our liberty -if we
don’t stand up,” Gerhardt said.

Lee thought Occupy Pitts-
burgh had accomplished its goals.
She said the Occupy movement
changed the dialogue in the coun-
try, raised a nationwide aware-
ness of corruption and greed and
made its message heard.

_ Ward also noted that, in her

Last week‘, a- saddening contro-

versy stirred the University of 1
Massachusetts Amherst “cam-s
. pus. ‘ '

It all started, with junior
Tyler Molander sliding’ letters
under doors of dorm rooms on
campus. The *- ﬁve-paragraph.
messages were signed with his
' name and stamped withsmiley
faces. Molander said he wanted’

to start a-“friends club”»out of -

loneliness and asked anyone in-
terested to meet him at a‘cam-
~pus dining hall. .

1

But what alarmed students;

was how he ended his letter.

“Pleasedon’t come if you are ac— -

quainted with me, I apologize,
butjust trust me,” he wrote.
Students circulated the letter

' and contacted campus police.
The Daily Collegian, UMass"

student newspaper, reports
that —— according to Molander
— he was deemed a non—threat
by the university but was asked,
to withdraw aft_er  ﬁve-hour
psychological examination.
Considering the private na-

ture of the .situation and sub-*

sequent information left out of
.the public sphere, we will com-
ment based on what has been
reported. . ‘
.We think Pitt students can

relate to this situation, as UMass _

is of comparable size and aca-
demic ranking to our University.’
Such as large populationof stu-
dents offers many opportunities
to make new friends, but it’s also
easy to get lost in the crowd. It
seems like Molander just want-
ed to make friends and couldn’t
ﬁnd the right way to do it.

The university’s administra-
tion is under ﬁre for what it did.
Commenters sympathize with
Molander, pointing out that his
message wasn’t explicitly threat-
ening. . The Collegian’s edito-
rial board goes ﬁirther, arguing
that, despite his unconventional
way of trying to bring together
‘a community and make friends,
Molander did not deserve to be
alienated by the administration,
if that was the case.

But even if Molander was
subjected to a thorough psycho-
logical evaluation that resulted
in the administration decid-

- ing to ask him to withdraw,’we-

don’t think that decision can

lnecessarily be ;ne’gat7ively?-“criti-

cized. Here’s why. .

q - First] of all, it is ‘the‘l_univer-bl
sity’s job _toqeducate,_ not reha-
bilitate. O T

, This

tive experience for someone

under this much distress, and
his class ‘work wouldn’t likelybe t

reﬂective of his abilities; -
The role of the university has’,
changed in this regard, th’o'ugh.

Some resident assistants take one
the role of counselor, and here at .
' Pitt we have a Counseling} Cen-= —. '
ter that serves as a valuable re,-f
' source for students. But we must

remember that__not' allcases are

. treatable while in school, 
_ there’s nothingwrong with that.

It’s easy to get fed up with a

university, especially when] it
. comes to a high-proﬁlelincident ,

like~this. But we need to trust

“ that the university is doing-what

is best for allof itsstudents.  .
With the greater good in

mind, we can’t scrutinize an in——
T stitution for lerringon the pre-

ventative side. With hundreds’

of students alarmed,‘ UMass“
 had to act quickly.‘ The ‘language ’

Molander used in his letter
wasn’t necessarily threatening,
but it was vague enough that it
was open to interpretation.” T 

With that said, the~adminis-.H=
tration took care of the situa-_
tion effectively and quickly. We V

canonly hope thatif Pitt were
in a. similar situation, Univer-

We wish Molander the best,
and we hope he ﬁnds the sup-

. port he needs. But we think it’s

unfair to chastise UMass for

Political language is often nasty.
Less frequently noticed,
however, is the constant use of
meaningless language in poli-
tics. George Orwell famously
complained of this, ‘among other
things, in his 1946 essay “Poli—
tics and the English Language.”

Orwell lamented that words like-

democracy, freedom and justice
are bandied about, without clear
deﬁnitions of what they mean
and, instead, with only the impli-
cation that they are good things.
This election year, I am remind-
ed of how little has changed in
66 years. Our political discourse
and our airwaves are ﬁlled with"
buzzwords without meaning.

We hear candidates attacked
as “in thrall to Washington spe-
cial interests” in ads that tout
the opposing candidate’s inde-
pendence from those interests
and his AARP endorsement. But
we seldom hear what those spe-
cial interests are, other than a

Political sphere f

    

very vague, very menacing group
of shadowy things that will no
doubt destroy the Republic if
not checked by a few heroic and
deeply moral Congressjedi.

We are asked to hate special
interests and the congressmen
who serve them, yet we never
hear special interests mentioned
by name. If we did, they wouldn’t
seem so scary. Pitt is a Harris-
burg special interest. We want
more money —— hence special

- treatment — from the state. By

extension, the students who’ve
gone to Harrisburg to complain
about the recent funding cuts
form a part of that special inter-
est. The AARP, unions, the Sierra
Club, the NRA,'the NAACP, the
Catholic Church, the Freedom
From Religion Foundation —
these are some of the names and
faces that make up those shad-
owy special interests.

Once the faceless special in-'
terest groups have faces put on ’

them, they don’t seem so vaguely
sinister. In fact, I would bet that
every reader of this paper sym-
pathizes with and would actively

encourage at least two special-

interest groups. And yet, nobody
would want to admit it. ' "

“Ah,” you might say, “but I
only support. or belong to grass-
roots groups.” Here is another
phrase that has lost its mean-

ing. When does a group become 7

large enough to not be “grass-
roots” anymore‘? If the richest
guy in Pittsburgh and 200 of his
friends start a group, it probably

»wouldn’t be called grassroots.

But if you, I and 200 other stu-
dents start a group, it’s grass-
roots because it comes from
“the people,” even though the

, only real difference between the
rich guy’s group and mine is the '

amount of money we h'aveavail-
able. Similarly, the Tea Party has
been attacked for being an “as—
troturf” movement, funded by

the Koch Sith Lords, um, broth- A

ers. And yet The New York Times
did not have a problem saying on
Oct. 16 that “President Obama is

paign fundraising to bankroll

nization.” I was unaware that
grassroots organizations could
be both sprawling and funded
by campaign fundraising con-
ducted by the president of the
United States, but apparently
they can be.

These are but two examples
of ‘how ourlpolitical discourse
is increasingly conducted

with words’ that either have no

meaning or have a meaning that
is elastic. This is bad for several
reasons. First, meaningless lan-
guage makes it much easier to
engage in rhetoric or political
argument without a ﬁrm un-
derstanding of what is going
on. Those special. interests the

' congressmen arelbeholden to:

Whatare they, and do you agree
with their basic policy posi-
tions? ‘Finding this out requires
research. With the vagueness
of political language, you can
get away with merely saying “I
don’t like special interests” and
bashing accused * congressmen.

elastic is that elasticity is easily
manipulated. Ideas packaged as
“progressive” tend- to’ be more
popular than exactly the same
ideas packaged as “liberal.” V

A By choosing a term with
which to label an idea, a poli-
tician very deftly makes that
idea more or less likely to gain
traction, regardless of its actual
merits. Similarly, by saying that
someone is “soft on crime,” a
speaker can. obscure what the
target of the accusation actu-
ally means to do (which, could

hiring out serial killers as day-

care teachers). At the extreme, ' l

we end up with an Orwellian
scenario in which some animals
are more equal than others, war
is peace, freedom is slavery and
ignorance is strength.

A third and related problem
is that imprecise political lan-
guage leads to arguments over
the stupidest things. The Tea

Party: grassroots or pastroturf?.
_ Does it really matter? More i-m-

portant is who they are, what
they are advocating and wheth-
er we believe that to be good or
bad. Meaningless words draw’
people into arguments about
what words mean rather than
the merits of the ideas those
words should be representing.
While to some extent meaning-
less words are an inevitable re-
sult of trying to come up with
shorthand and shibboleth, we
should avoid letting them be all
we ever think or talk about.

We interrupt your regular-
ly schedtlleld programming to
bring you Fat TV. That’s right,

all of your favorite shows, now ‘

available in plus size. _
As a senior who has attended
enough Golf Pros and Tennis
Hos—themed parties to satisfy
me for the rest of my life, I’ve
enjoyed spending_(at least the
earlier part of) my Friday nights
this school year watching TLC’s
‘Bridal Friday.‘ Apparently, wed-
ding shows have changed a bit
since I religiously watched them.
in high school. “Say Yes to the
Dress: Big Bliss,” a spin—off of
“Say Yes to the Dress,” was a_dd—
ed to TLC’s line-up a little more
than a year ago. I-t features plus-
sized women trying to ﬁnd their
dream wedding dresses, just as
the original series showed slim-
mer women doing the same.
Although I appreciate that
TLC is showinglbrides that are
not all sample size _(4 or 6), why

do the plus-sized girls need their I ‘

own show? Why can’t TLC‘ just
have a mix of women on “Say Yes
to the Dress”?

What I have a real issue with is
that, by making a separate show
for larger brides," TLC blatantly
labels larger brides as differ-
ent and out of the norm, when,
in fact, the average American
woman is a size 12. What TLC,
then, presented as "‘normal”
in the original series is not. Yet
the trend for such a separation
is typical in» the media these

_days (“More To Love” as a coun-

terpart to “The Bachelor” and

“Mike 8: Molly” as a “Whitney”
type show with fat jokes).

Women of all sizes deserve
the same care and level of ser-
vice when dress shopping. We all
have our own ﬁt issues because
we all have differently shaped
bodies. By TLC’s - reasoning,
there should be a special series
for each body type — tall, pear-
shaped, large-chested. “Say Yes
to the Dress: Wide Hips”?

My issue is notiwith the ac-
tual treatment that these brides

' receivefrom the staff at Klein-

feld Bridal. The consultants
give the same lovely and fun-
to-watch service .as'they do on
the original. My issue is with
the premise. In the original se-
ries, each episode has a theme:
women who bring their ﬁances
dress shopping, hard-to-please
mothers, diva brides. The brides
on “Big Bliss” could easily ﬁt
into any one of these categories,
making storyline, not image, the
theme of the show.

One of the brides featured on
an'episode of “Big Bliss”.met her
groom after he found her on a
website for men who like large
women. How about featuring
brides who met their grooms
in ways that have nothing to do
with their size — like the rest of
the world. Highlighting couples
like the one aforementioned
makes larger women seem like a
fetish niche, incapable of receiv-
ing love-in the traditional sense.

Then we come to the issue
of what I like to. call “squeeze
shots” —— footage of brides get-
ting stuck in dresses. I’ve tried
to squeeze my butt into jeans
at many Gap stores across the
country, and I’m so glad no one

‘Sy Yes to the Dress: Big Bliss’ a big offense

has ever ﬁlmed it. Sure, these la-

dies agreed to be ﬁlmed, but the
editing of the footage is done to
make the too—small-dress—sl1im—
my look humorous instead of like
a normal part of the shopping
process. A commercial break
will cpme just as the bridal con-
sultant tugs to remove the dress.
Will she or won’t she be able to

, get it off? Will they bring out the

scissors? Will Cindy spend the
rest of her life in this Balenciaga
gown? We have to stay tuned!

The show only chronicles"

the ﬁt struggle happening with
plus-sized brides because the
dresses they’re trying on are, as
was previously mentioned, the
sample sizes 4 or 6. TLC might

’ not be able to change the fashion

industry’s idea of “sample size.”
However, it can change the way
women of all shapes and sizes
are portrayed on TV. As happy as
I am to see women of all shapes
and sizes being given advice on
feeling beautiful for their spe-
cial day, it’s a shame that TLC
addresses the issue in this way,
turning what could be a great
program about embracing all
body types into a body—image
traihwreck.

We tune into “Say Yes” to
see a mom cry as her daughter
steps out in a princess dress or
the drama when a woman on her
second marriage brings along
her children who" don’t agree
with her desire for a more mod-
est dress. The show is about cel-
ebrating the beauty of marriage
and the fun of planning a wed-
ding, not watching women try to
wiggle into a sample size. '

It’s really hard not to enjoy a show consist-
ing of scantily clad women, death-defying
motocross feats‘ and nonstop pyrotech-
nics. 1

And for all who can’t get enough of
the above-mentioned entertainment
and weren’t at the Consol Energy Center

"Saturday night, you missed out. Nuclear
Cowboyz, a traveling road show centered
on freestyle motocross and extreme pyro-
technics made the ﬁrst of its 15 scheduled
U.S. appearances in Pittsburgh.

The show is a well-orchestrated and
smoothly choreographed smorgasbord
of motocross and ATV stunts. Perform-
ers ride around a center-stage main ramp
with smaller side ramps where they seem
to defy gravity. It’s all performed to a
soundtrack of heavy metal,‘ alternative
rock and electronic dubstep music that
competes with the roar of the motorcycle
engines. -

back and forth on the same ramps could
become repetitive after two hours, the
show follows a storyline. Throughout the

Recyclahlesjoilrneyfromllin to plant, Pitt competes lot ecu-friendlinessgi  

' Emma Kilcup
Staﬁ Writer ,

The plastic bottle from your lunch
is about to go on an adventure.
The process begins in a recy-
cling bin. If the bin is not too con-
taminated byjtrash _——i which can
go a long way toward preventing

- recycling —— a custodian takes it
to where contracted recycler Al— _

lied Waste Services picks it up
and takes it to‘ Pittsburgh Recy-
cling. What cannot berecycled
at that facility goes to Greenstar
Recycling. "

=.Scott Dellinger, East Region

Reclycling Consultant of- Green- V.

,»star' Recycling, describes the
continuation of the cycle once it
reaches Greenstar.

“We do not reﬁne material, we
just recover it,” Dellinger said.

He explained that they sepa-
rate the paper from the containers
by using star screens that extract
paper. Glass is sorted by color, put
through a screen where nonfer—
rous material is used to recover
aluminum. After 'that,. only plas-
tic is left —— including that plastic
bottle -— which the facility sorts
by using a light to identify its color.
Once all of the material has been
separated, Greenstar uses heavy-

. duty balers to create big cubes of

the recycled waste to ship off to a
mill where they’ll be further re-
ﬁned, completing the cycle. I

For Dellinger, it’s a process
that just makes sense.

“Landﬁlls run out of space.

. You can throw it away; that’s your

choice,” said Dellinger. “As for
plastic water bottles, every bottle
has a high percentage of oil. So if
you‘ throw away your plastic, we
have to buy oil. We have to de-
« pend’lon foreign sources, but it’s
Very easy to recover p.lastic.”‘
“Easy” is not a word that’s
often been associated with re-
cycling in the past. But on-cam-
pus efforts toward reusing have
grown over the years, along with

related outlets for students. Still, _

not all of the efforts have reaped
rewards. Seth Bush, the coor-
dinator of Pitt’s Green Fund, a

j group that helps coordinate sus-

tainability projects on campus,
saidthat the University should
have much more recycling than
waste because of the high amount
of paper and plastic containers
used. He agreed that waste dis-
posal is an individual’s choice,
but there are options other than
the garbage bin.

‘Bush said, ‘—“When making a

fproduct, you take raw material,
_vff‘{kE:li1‘lCl that is processed in a factory
I  made into a bottle. You can do

afew things with that bottle: You
"can throw it out,’ which means we
-have to pull more raw resources;
you can recycle, which puts the

_material back into the cycle that

can be made into something like
a bench or jacket; you can reuse,
like reﬁll a water bottle and use
it for a few days. Also, you can al-
ways reduce and not buy it if you
don’t need it.” ~ - v

V » Both Bush and Dellinger know
that materials should be reused

‘ rather than sit in a landﬁll.

" ‘_In today’s world, almost ev-

{?:erything is ..’ré"cyclable.—‘ _ Bush ex-
I plained that the University only

used to recycle plastics num-
bered one and two. — grades of
recyclable plastics — but now

L the University recycles plastics

one through seven. Water bottle

caps are ﬁne to leave on the bottle -

now, making it even easier just to
toss bottles right into bins.

“What you’re doing is a small-
er action of a larger movement
— you have a smaller incentive
to "take part,” senior Casey Brad-
ford said. “It’s like voting. If there
are lots of people who are voting,
there’s less of an- incentive be-
cause your. vote doesn’t matter. If
it was easier, like on the Internet,
more people would.”

On Feb. 5, Pitt started compet-
ing with universities around the
country for a top ranking in just
that -— recycling. RecycleMania
spans eight weeks, ending March
31, during which the University’s
sustainability efforts "will be re-
corded and measured against
others’. .

Last year, Pitt was ranked 162
of 289 with a 26.16 percent over-
all recycling rate. Pitt ranked at

.144 the year before that, but the
competition was only out of 267 _

schools. Since then, Pitt has im-

proved in waste minimization, _

increasing its position by 2 per-
cent and moving up six ranks, all
in spite of other universities’ stu-
dent populations also becoming
more involved.

Pitt shows potential this year

in its paper recycling aspect. In.

the pre-program statistics, Pitt
has displayed advancement in
the paper and cardboard catego-
ries, although it ‘seems to have
slacked in the overall recycling
rate, dropping to 38.28 percent.
The contest has yet to begin,

. though, and by appealing to stu-

dents’ competitive natures the
program hopes to create motiva-
tion to participate.

Between 2010 and 2011, Pitt
moved from a C to B- on the Col-
lege Sustainability Report Card.
The administration moved from
a B to an A as Pitt, according to
the reportcard, “incorporated
sustainability into the campus
master plan and strategic plan.”
For food and recycling, the Uni-
versity received an A. The stu-
dent involvement grade moved
up from a C to a B, due mostly to
clubs and student researchers.

Pitt ﬁrst entered the Recy-
cleMania competition in 2008,
as planned by Bush, then presi-
dent of Free the Planet, a student
environmental advocacy group.
Bush’s new project, the Green
Fund, was oﬂicially written into
Pitt’s Student Government bylaws «

. in December of 2011. The Green

Fund Advisory Board helps ﬁmd
projects and improvements for a
sustainable campus.

Already, the board has plans
past RecycleMania.

“By mid ‘ to late - summer,
Greenstar is bringing equipment

to recycle plastic bags. As an ini-
tiative to reduce plastic, we also
hope. to hand out reusable bags
to all students, which are usually
made of recycled materials too,”
Bush said.

Bush explained that Recy-

cleMania,‘ which has been a good
incentive for students to recycle
more and waste less, also helps
Pitt’s Facilities Management to
ﬁgure out “hot spots” around
campus where permanent bins
should go. In addition to those
that exist already, Bush explained
that there will be more “trifecta”
bins installed around campus.
’ With bins abounding, recy-
cling is becoming more acces-
Sible. 0 .

As for new recycling efforts?

‘ Bradford has some ideas.

“If beer distributors offered
rebates for recycling, that would
be a good ﬁnancial incentive,”
Bradford said.

Bradford explained that, while
on campus, it’s easy enough to
recycle since there are signs on
different bins for different mate-
rials. But he lives of campus and
deals with the diﬂicultyof recy-

   
 
 
  
    
   

 

FIWETURE

Couches, tables. chairs and lamps (in
working order) can be donated to a charity,
many of which will pick them up

   

cling without the same accessi-
bility..

But it doesn’t have to be dif-
ﬁcult. Bush explained that, by
city ordinance, landlords are re-
quired to provide their residents
with blue recycling bins. For
those who want to avoid landlord
tiffs, Giant Eagle sells blue bags
to put recycled materials in for
pickup.

RecycleMania aims to mo-
tivate the smaller parts of the
whole in college terms. Its web-
site says, “By framing recycling
in competitive terms, RecycleM-
ania seeks to tap school spirit as a
motivator to reach students who
may not otherwise respond to en-
vironmental messages.” ,

Whatever the motivator might
be, the ramiﬁcations of ignor-
ing the environment are already
becoming evident, if s_ubt1y.“The
negative effects of not recycling
are not apparent, except that
there’s no snow on the ground,
and it’s warm every other day,”
said Bradford. “Plus, I’m con-
cerned about the polar bears. I
don’t- want the polar bears to be-
come solar bears.” I

Every year on Valentine’s Day we’re re-
minded to tell people we love them with a
fairly speciﬁc list of gifts. '

On this holiday that inspires grand
gestures of undying love and atrocious en-
semble rom—coms, purchasing a bad gift is
nearly impossible. ‘

Sure, on other holidays there are people
who have an innate ability to pick out the
most inappropriate gifts for their loved
ones a memberships to weight—loss pro-
grams, subscriptions to magazines they’ll
never read, self—help books.

Thankfully, Valentine’s Day swoops in
to save gift—givers like these. The formula is
pretty standard; chocolates, cards, flowers
and maybe some hanky-panky. No, it might
not be original, but at least it isn’t soap that
smells like your grandmother’s closet.

But what to get isn’t the biggest con-
cern on Valentine’s Day as far as gifts go —
who doesn’t love heart—shaped foods? The
main concern isn’t the what, but the who.
For all those relationships that involve an
explanation — and even those that can be

summed up by the old Facebook staple “It’s V

complicated” — there’s that anxiety about
whether to give a gift or how big of one to
give.

Here’s a rundown on the appropriate-
ness of what to get someone for the holiday

of love, based on a ‘few common relation-
ship statuses. .

Your Unaware Crush/Unrequited Love; '

You aren’t dating, you aren’t hooking up,
you aren’t anything really. This person
either doesn’t know how desperately in
love you are or_isn’t looking for more than
friendship. ‘ . I

Either way, rethink‘ the grand roman-
tic gestures. If you’re good friends and
it wouldn’t be weird to give them a goofy
card ‘or a friendly ﬂower, that’s great.

But save the big display of love for a day
when ——- should things go poorly — you

are not both heartbroken and surrounded ~
by ﬂowers, romance and intensely affec-

tionate couples.

Your “Fun Buddy”; You’ve been hooking
up with him or her for a couple of weeks
now — usually after 12 a.m.—— and always
after more than a few shots. .

You likely don’t know his or her middle
name. In fact, you might have just recently
learned the ﬁrst one. But after seeing those
long-stemmed ‘roses your roommate got
from her loving boyfriend, your judgement
clouds and it seems like a grand idea to get
your buddy something for Valentine’s Day.

Don’t do it. E ' - '

Well, don’t do it if you’re looking to keep
them at “fun buddy” — only status. Unless
you want more than the physical, just stick
to giving them a satisfying roll in the hay.

Your Signiﬁcant Other of One Week to
a Few Months: There are still all kinds of
butterﬂies and you’ve barelynoticed a ﬂaw

 

on this brand new meaningful someone.
But as happy as you are, the relationship
is still pretty green, and getting something

cute — and not overboard — _is probably A '

your best bet. _

You can have a blast at dinner and a
movie or exchange a cheesy card and some
candy. But be careﬁal, because something
too intense or too lovey—dovey might send
the wrong message, particularly if you
aren’t ready to exchange those three little
words that the holiday is all about.

Your Signiﬁcant Other of Six Months
or More: You’ve been a solid couple for a
while, and it’s time to get romantic, y’all.

Valentine’s Day might have its cheesy
moments, but if you guys have been dating '
for this long, you both deserve something‘
special. ' ‘
Step your game up. Acceptable exam-
ples: A nice dinner at somewhere other
than Qdoba, Red Robin or Market Central; I
jewelry that doesn’t come from a grocery

V store vending machine; tickets to a concert

or event you’ll both enjoy.

And bythis point, you probably know
your signiﬁcant other enough to be able to
give them something personal and speciﬁc .

' to his or her tastes. . '

Your Recently Dumped Friend: You pity
them on this cursed day. You pity yourself
even more if you’re one of them.

Fortunately, there are plenty of gift

The School of Sustainability and the Environment (SSE), established in 2009,
provides the necessary expertise in social justice, economic development,
and environmental studies to support sostainable goals and practices from
the individual to the global level. The vision of the schooi is in keeping with
the legacy of Rachel Carson, Chathants most distinguished alumna, whose
work led to the founding of the modern environmental movement. Currently
based at Chatham University's historic Shadyside Campus, the school will
eventually be housed at a new, 388-acre carbonneutral Eden Hall Campus

was more than enough to hold the show

At times, it was even clever and humor- '

tricks as competition. When they join

a terrible towel above his head, tucking it
into his uniform for theshow.

But the fast pace of the show means
that it’s hard to catch everythinggoing on.
At times, there was so much happening at
oncethat it was hard "to take in what every
rider was doing. The well-timed feats were
impressive, with riders jumping with just
a few feet between them, but it caused
some sensory overload for the audience.
With so many riders constantly moving, it

was easy to miss some of the best tricks of -
W the night. i A
The show ended with the narrator in-

troducing each individual rider. During
his introduction, the rider took center
stage to show off his skills. This was the
part of the show that received the longest
and loudest ovation from theaudience
———‘in part because the show was over, but
also because audience members could fo-
cus one rider doing one move at a time.

After the show, attendees were able to

meet the riders. .

Overall, the show was to motocross
what Cirque du Soleil is to circuses — a
storied feat that pushed human agility to

’ the limit. E

., MEN’S BASKETBALL

By Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writer

You might remember my last

column on Pitt basketball. _

It began by warning readers
not to expect to see Pitt in
the NCAA Tournament this
year. But now the tables have
turned.

The Panthers (15—9, 4-7

~ Big East) are riding a four-

game winning streak since
the return of the team’s point
guard, Travon Woodall.

_The A Panthers’ ﬁrst
conference win this
year against Providence
was impressive, but not
necessarily a resumé—topper
by the standards of the NCAA
committee. It was essential
that Pitt beat Providence at
the Petersen Events Center
in order to get back on track.
This victory was followed
by a convincing 12-point
win over No. 9 Georgetown,
an eight—point win over the
Mountaineers at the Coliseum
and a nine—point winover the
Villanova Wildcats on their
home court.

It won’t be easy to get into

the tournament. The NCAA ,
 committee can, at times, be

very unpredictable, but the
Panthers are certainly doing
their best to make a strong
case for abid late in the season.

The team has shown that its

will to win is still strong and
that it can defeat teams both
on the road and at home.
Pitt’s winning streak is hard
to ignore, especially after its

_ losing eight straight games.

I The Panthers’ RPI — their
rating percentage index,
which is used to calculate a
team’s strength of schedule
along with its win percentage

_ —— continues to rise as. they

defeat top conference teams.
Of the eight remaining teams,
seven have RPIs currently
ranking them. within the

top 100 teams. With wins
over these teams, Pitt could
continue to make itscase for a
tournament bid.

Don’t get too excited just
yet, though. Pitt is still tiedfor
10th place in the conference

with three other teamsl(Si"eton— A
Hall, Rutgers and St.._]ohn’s)
that have 4-7 conferences;

records. With’ seveniie

‘remaining, it’s  
predict how the rest ._of ~tl1“e A
season will play out. Still,

remaining on the schedule
are away games against South
Florida, Seton Hall, Louisville
and Connecticut. Pitt still has
to play St. John’s and a tough
West Virginia team at the
Petersen Events Center before
bids for the NCAA Tournament
are ﬁnalized. '

Realistically, the Panthers
probably need at least six wins
out of the remaining eight
games. Three losses would
make the NCAA Committee’s
potential decision to knock
the Panthers off the bubble
much easier. Limiting the
rest of the season’s record to
only one loss would brighten
the Panthers’ chances all the
more. '

After the regular season,
there’stheBigEasttournament.
To be comfortable going into
March, the Panthers will
need to win several games.
The tournament’s venue,
Madison Square Garden in
New York City, has been called
the “Panthers’ second home
court.” But the Panthers are
likely to be playing a top-
four team like Syracuse,
Georgetown or Notre Dame in
the ﬁrst round. To get the win
against one of those teams in
a high—pressure environment
will be difﬁcult, but Pitt has
done it before. And if the
Panthers can pull off the upset,
it would only help their bid for
the NCAA Tournament.

A GRAIN. OF SAUL

Patriots’ cut

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

Life isn’t that bad for Tiquan
Underwood, so the pity party
can stop now. i -

Just 24 hours before Super
Bowl kickoff, the New England

' Patriots wide receiver was cut

from the team to be replaced
by a defensive tackle who
.didn’t see a single snap. ,

The move, ' which drew
national attention, was one
of the many sub—plots of the
Super Bowl this year.

Underwood ended up
getting. his 15 minutes of fame
for handling his release with
class, and the Twitter world
came out with an “unreal”_
amount of support, as
Underwood described it.

He had 7,000 followers the
day before he was cut, and
12,000 by Sunday’s kickoff.

After being released,

 Underwood V tweeted, “Good

Luck To The New England
Organization, The Coaches,
8: All My Teammates...

’ #PatsNation.” _

Some people felt bad for
Underwood because he had
just gottenﬁnished shavingthe
Patriots logo onto the back of
his head for Super Bowl week.
Some felt bad because he was a
third—year vet whose dream of

receiver Underwood doesn’t need, or deserve, pity party  

stepping onto the ﬁeld during
the Super Bowl was thrown
away just hours before kickoff.
Some were baffled by how he
could still root for a team that
turned its back on him on the

' eve of Super Bowl Sunday.

“It’s going to be different
watching ‘the game on TV,
knowing that you put in the
time, put in the reps to be a
part of the game,” Underwood
told Mashable.com. “But I get
to sit back and watch as afan
now, and I’ll be rooting for the
Patriots.” A _

Because Bill Belichick, the
Patriots coach, took so long
to release Underwood, many
believed the timing of the
decision. occurred to prevent
the possibility of Underwood
being picked up by the Giants
off waivers and giving New
York information about his
former team.

ACBSSports.comcolumnist
said, “He was ‘released because
Bill Belichick had to be the
smartest guy in the room, even
if that meant gutting a nice kid
like Tiquan Underwood.”

. But I’d caution his readers

to ‘slow down and remember

few things: V
First of all, Bill Belichick
the smartest guy in the room,
He doesn’t have to be, it
doesn’t want to be_— he is,

FROM PAGE l2

It would be unfair to write

a column on a possible Pitt.

postseason without explaining
how the team moved from
an eight—game losing streak
to lightly knocking on the
NCAA’s door. The explanation
is simple: Woodall.

Since his return from
injury, Woodall has single-

handedly taken control of _

games and shown on—the—
court leadership that the team
had been drastically lacking.
Woodall scored 29 points, a
career high, against Villanova

on Sunday, shooting 7—of—12
from the ﬁeld — 3—of—6 from
behind the arc — and sinking

all twelve of his foul shots._

Against West Virginia, he had
24 points.

The Panthers struggled
tremendously with shooting
in Woodall’s absence. This was
one of _the major reasons for
the ‘eight-game losing streak.
But not only have Woodall’s
numbers improved the team’s,
his presence has -improved
others’ shooting as well.

The dynamic combination
of Ashton Gibbs and Woodall
as a backcourt tandem is a
force that cannot be reckoned
with; Having known one
another since the seventh

ﬁve appearances in the last 10
years, and just because he’s
been bested by Eli Manning
the last few seasons doesn’t
mean he doesn’t know what
he’s doing anymore.

Secondly,_ I think it’s

, interesting that nobody talks

about Alex Silvestro" —— y
know, the defensive tack 
Belichick brought up

from the I

Why don’t
headlines, read:
Belichick‘

anyone tweeting abo 1‘
how awesome it is th 
Silvestro got called u

hours before kickoff?
Instead, popular
opinion’s decided that
Belichick is a heartless
coach whose players a
expendable. 

People ‘ea ha, Q2;
the faetth tr

grade, the two play together
naturally. T Quite simply, when
Woodall is in the game, Gibbs
can focus on ﬁnding his shot
and Woodall can focus on
getting him the ball. Woodall

‘has said many times before

that the goal of his ﬁrst look
off any play is to “get the ball
to Ash.”

V Against Villanova, Gibbs
had 25 points

and shot
4-8 from the 3-point line.
Together, Gibbs and Woodall
shot 19—of—19 from the free-
throw line.

Woodall doesn’t just bring
scoring and play creation to

A the table. He also averages ﬁve

rebounds and four assists per
game. He controls the tempo of

’ the Wildcats’

Silvestro didn’t play all they’
want, because Underwood
wasn’t' going to see a snap
either. The Patriots needed
depth at the defensive tackle
position, and if they would
have had somebody go down
up fr,0nt...,_Silvestro would’ve

     
  
 
   
 
   
  
  
  
 
   
   
   
   
   
 
  
   
    
   
   
   
    
    
 
 

the team and the management
of the clock. Perhaps most
importantly, Woodall brings
experience and energy.

After Woodall hit a big

three against Villanova and«

dished out another key assist,
head coach
Jay Wright called a timeout.
Woodall pumped his ﬁst,
ﬂexed his muscles and looked
to the Oakland Zoo, which
was already going crazy. This
kind of energy hasn’t been
characteristic of the Panthers
at all yet this season; it’s an
intangible Woodall brings to
the game with him. He brings
immeasurable contributions
to this team during every
contest.

] Schefter

 

been ready to go and Belichick’
would have been praised as a
genius.

Here is a reminder for

‘everyone: This is the National

Football League. Underwood,
didn’t get cut from his high‘
school team the day before the
State Championship because
they didn’t have enough
seats on the bus —— —he was

replaced on a professional ~

sports team by a player that
was deemed more important
than him for the most
important game of the year.

It wasn’t like Underwood
was thrown under the rug and’
forgotten about. "'

As ESPN insider Adam
reported, if the
Patriots had won, Underwood

would still have gotten both

his Super Bowl ring and his
Super Bowl bonus, simply
because he was active for eight
games during the season.

And you wonder why he
was still rooting for the Pats
to win? Q

‘ At this point in the season,
all Panther fans can do is wait.
A situation in which the team’s
fate is not entirely in its own
hands is difficult to grapple!‘
with —— and many other
factors are at play in this case.
The manner in which the rest
of the conference shakes out
and the number of games out
of the remaining eight that‘
Pitt can stack on its resume

will determine whether or

not the Panthers will have a
postseason to look forward to.
If Tray Woodall has anything to
do with the decision, though,.,,
you can bet on seeing Pitt in
the NCAA Tournament. 1
