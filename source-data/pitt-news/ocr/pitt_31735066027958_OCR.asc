tells Carnegie crowd of
his celestial discovery

Harold Turner

 

As the star cluster he’d been observing
moved lazily by with the rest of the sky,
Thomas Bopp, standing in a ﬁeld 70 miles
from his home, peered through a ﬁiend’s
telescope at a “big blurry star.”

He asked his friends to take a look and
began ﬂipping through an astronomical
atlas listing more than 200,000 bodies in
that area.

According to the atlas, however, there
was nothing there.

Bopp spent the rest of the evening
scrambling to reach a telephone and call in
the discovery.

The next morning, Dan Green of the
Central Bureau for Astronomy phoned
Bopp with the news.  Bopp,” he said,
“Congratulations. I think you’ve got a
comet.”

Bopp visited the Carnegie Science
Center Saturday evening and recounted

' this anecdote of his discovery of what

would become the most studied comet in
history.

Bopp found the comet within minutes
of a fellow amateur astronomer, Alan Hale.
But while Bopp spent the rest of the

evening racing through northern Arizona to
call in the ﬁnd to the Central Bureau for
Astronomy, Hale simply walked inside
from his driveway and sent the center an e-
mail.

The crowd that gathered to hear
Bopp’s account at the Carnegie Science
Center was so large that the spillover had to
be accommodated in the planetarium next
door. Unfortrmately, the folks in the plane-
tarium weren’t afforded the opportunity to

see Bopp’s amazing slide show —— they
could only hear him speak. .

Bopp’s playful presentation included
the story of the night he found the comet,
the astronomy world’s subsequent frenzy,
and a few amazing facts about the comet
itself, but he started off with a little ir1for—
mation about himself. \

“I became interested in astronomy
back when I was four and I watched a
meteor shower with my father,” he said.

“After I moved out west for a job opportu-

that didn’t last very long. I’ve never been
one for ‘club politics.’”

Bopp exchanged friendly banter with
the horde of amateur astronomers and pep-
pered his lecture with anecdotes and stories
from his life as a stargazer.

Eight students from Pitt, including

members from the University’s
Governmental Relations Committee, went
to Washington, D.C., for the United States
Students Association conference two week-
ends ago and came back so enthralled with
their experience that they urged the Student
Government Board to fund another USSA
conference trip in Madison, Wis, in July.

The upcoming conference is for the
USSA National Student Congress.

At the Wednesday SGB meeting,
Adam Neary, chair of the GRC, told the
Board about the trip to D.C. He said it was
important to each person who attended, and
also described how important the accom-
plishments in Washington were to fellow
students.

Capitol Hill and attended many workshops.
We spoke with a representative from Sen.
Arlen Specter’s office and found out he
may be planning a trip to Pitt, which would
be excellent,” said Neary.

Before Neary ﬁnished speaking, he
told the board and the audience about an
award the Pitt representatives won while in
D.C. Pitt was only one of two schools to
win the Outstanding Commitment to
USSA and Educationa1—Access Award.
Neary said that Pitt shared the honor with
the University of North Carolina, Chapel
Hill.

The meeting then was opened to new
business by the different committees. At
this time, Allocations Chair Noelle
Carnpagna presented ﬁnal appeals for allo-
cations requests.

Brandi Mlller tells the other SGB members to wait until
they learn who else wants to attend the July USSA

Student lobbyists campaign for
financial aid, meet congressmen

 

Eight delegates selected by the Student
Government Board returned last week from
a lobbying effort with an award in hand and
yet another board—of-directors position for
Pitt.

The SGB’s Governmental Relations
Committee received $3,60() from student
activities fees in February to ﬁrnd the ﬁve-
day trip to the U.S. Students’ Association
conference in Washington, D.C.

The representatives said they learned
about problems concerning ﬁnancial aid.
Then they spoke to congressmen about the
laws they wanted changed and lobbied for
student issues on the designated lobbying
day.

But does the Pitt student body really
beneﬁt from the conference, or was it just a
training ground for future bureaucrats?

this year’s conference, neither could point to
any plans or tangible results on Pitt’s campus.

Campbell said that the most important
thing that the delegates did at this year’s con-
ference was to work to increase the amount
that students may make in part—time or smn—
mer jobs without losing their Pell grants, state
grants, or ﬁnancial aid.

Campbell said he wants the numbers
increased from $1,750, the current amount
allowed before student income counts
against grants, to $3,200. “We want it to be
easier for students to become independent,”
he said

Neary said that the GRC’s main project
for the year is to set up a statewide student
association. At the conference, delegates
learned about states that have associations
linking schools, allowing them to share ideas.
Neary said that there is a meeting scheduled
in May between Pitt and Temple University
in hopes of setting up such a system in

“At the conference, Pennsylvania
we learned how to oper— “A state student associa-
ate efﬁciently within the tion will give us an oppor-
school system and how tunity to have a student
to work with student voice in Harrisburg all the

groups,” said delegate
Kira Spitzer, the GRC
.voter—registration educa-
tion chairwoman. “We
learned about the issues
facing students and how
to lobby for what the stu-
dents need”

When asked what
the delegates accom-
plished, GRC
Legislative Director
Keith Campbell said
they received comrnit—
ments from some con-
gressmen to vote for the issues that USSA
supports, but “that’s about it.”

“We learned a lot of organizing skills
and received training to organize students on
campus,” he said. “Hopefully, we can use
these skills to get more money for students.”

The Pitt delegates at the conference
received an award for outstanding cornmit—
ment to the USSA and educational access.
Only two schools in the country received the
award. Pitt shared the honor with the
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

GRC  Adam Neary said that
the recipients are chosen by the executive
staff.

“They determine which campuses
worked hard and committed themselves over
the past year,” he said.

But what tangible results has the GRC
been able to show to justify why it received
the award‘?

Neary and Campbell had stated that last
year’s conference brought back the Grass-
Roots Organizing Weekend prograrn to carn-
pus and helped to charter a more extensive
voter-registration drive.

Despite their claims that there would be
more beneﬁts brought back to campus after

time,” Neary said “We can
share common ideas with
students in Pennsylvania
who are at Pennsylvania
schools.”

Neary said he hoped that
the system will be irnple—
mented within the next
year. Initially, Neary and
Campbell had talked of
other schools joining the
association, but that has
been put on hold. Campbell
said most other campuses
are in the midst of student
government elections and must wait until the
elected ofﬁcials take oﬂice. “We want to at
least jump into the water before we pull other
people into it,” Neary said. laughing.

The delegates also had the opportunity
to attend several workshops at the confer-

ence, with the focuses on everything from

welfare to campus safety.

“We learned ways to increase student
awareness on campus,” Spitzer said.

At one of the workshops, delegate
Jennifer VV1lkins was elected co—chair of the
National Women of Color Coalition.

“We were represented at almost every
caucus,” Neary said. ‘Delegates attended
workshops that they identiﬁed with, and the
only caucus that wasn’t attended was the cau-
cus for students with disabilities.”

Some delegates were able to have one-
on—one conversations with legislators. Spitzer
talked to Congressman McHale of the 15th
District for almost an hour—and-a-half and got
him to commit to address the issues facing
students that the USSA is pushing for.

“Whether we talk with [congressmen]
every week, every month, or every few
months, it is valuable input that needs to be
recognized,” she

UPMC absorbs Shadyside Hospital in buyout

‘Michelle Singer

 

The UPMC and Shadyside

_ Hospital have finally merged into one

medical powerhouse after months of
planning.

The merger was ﬁrst announced
last June and officially took effect on
April 1. This collaboration is unprece-
dented because it is the first to consoli-
date services in an attempt to reduce
excess hospital beds, lowering the
health-care costs in the region.

According to Henry Mordoh, for-
mer president of the Shadyside
Hospital and current chief executive
officer of both Shadyside and
Presbyterian University Hospital,
“Shadyside Hospital and the UPMC

will operate as one clinically and’

administratively integrated economic
unit. We expect to reduce health-care
costs by millions of dollars as a result
of this merger.”

According to Jeffrey Romoff, pres-
ident of the UPMC system, the merger
is a result of the increasing push for
lower costs.

“There will be reductions in work
force across the health-care system,” he
said.

But, according to executives of the
merged facility, a hiring freeze at the

UPMC that has left 700 positions,

vacant will minimize the impact on
employees.

The 775 employees who are cur-
rently associated with Montefiore
University Hospital’s acute—care ser-
vices will either remain there in differ-
ent jobs or be transferred to other posi-
tions within the UPMC system.

The merger also stipulates that
Montefiore will transfer all of its acute-
care services, or “short—term care,” to
either Shadyside or Presbyterian
University Hospitals, eliminating 280
hospital beds and generating 6,000
more admissions to Shadyside.
Montefiore will still, however, contin-
ue to provide outpatient care.
Monteﬁore will use some of this space
for nursing-care facilities, ambulatory
programs, and subacute-care units.

“This merger capitalizes on the
strengths of both organizations,”
Romoff said.

He explained that this combination
is a logical way of replacing competi-
tion in medicine “with synergy.”

“Combining Shadyside’s tradition
of delivering the best private-practice
medicine in a patient—friendly, high-
quality environment with the academic
and research capabilities of one of the
nation’s leading medical centers is the
prudent action for two geographically

The merger will move services

such as the Geriatric Center, the Joint“

Reconstructive-Surgery Center, and the
UPMC Cancer Institute from the
Oakland campus to Shadyside.

Before the merger was finalized,
the UPMC and Shadyside haggled over
serious issues facing both parties. A

The most difficult issue was
Whether physicians in both hospitals
would have equal standing in the merg-
ing of facilities and services. Shadyside
also wanted a contract stating that it
would be given the opportunity to
expand, not to be downsized.

Although Mordoh said that the
agreement was “we1l—rounded,” and
Romoff added that it was most likely
fair and reasonable, given the “equally
dissatisfied” reactions of physicians on
both sides, many physicians have been
left feeling skeptical and angry about
the merger.

Romoff estimates that as a result of
this merger, the UPMC and Shadyside
will save up to $50 million once
Montef1ore’s acute—care facilities are
moved. As the merger is carried out,
Shadyside Hospital will be the center
for all administrative functions within
the new system.

“We are positioning ourselves to be
both the highest-quality and lowest-

proximate institutions,” Romoff cost provider in the area,” Mordoh
affirmed. said.

Among them was a request from the 1

GRC for $4,720 to fund the conference trip
in July. The Allocations Committee’s rec-
ommendation was to approve $1,383 and
deny $3,337, which would ﬁnance three
delegates’ attendance at the conference.

Before the vote, SGB President Justin
Da1Mo1in asked the Board and GRC mem-
bers whether they had anything to discuss.

Nearly every Board member had
something to say. .

Before Board members had their
chance to speak, however, Neary interject-
ed.

“Three delegates for this conference in
July eliminates our voting power. We need
at least ﬁve delegates to be effective,” said
Neary. “Coming off last weekend [in
Washington, D.C.], our eight delegates
were very successful.”

Board member Brandi Miller remind-
ed the Board that they didn’t know who the
ﬁve delegates would be, if they did indeed
approve ﬁve.

“Until we further know who the dele-
gates are, we should stick with three,”
Miller said.

She also told members of the Board to
decide whether they simply wanted to
have ﬁve votes at the conference, or

whether they wanted to know who the _

SGB was voting to send to the conference.

The Board asked Campagna how her
committee came to the decision to ﬁmd
three delegates.

“Allocations approves for all gover-
nance groups the funding of three people.
This is our general guideline. Besides, it’s
in the manual. It’s policy,” said Campagna.

Board member David Eisenberg then
asked Campagna whether the vote could
be deferred because the conference isn’t
until July 21.

Normally, deferring this request
would not have been granted because the
main focus of the Allocations Comrnittee’s
new business was to address ﬁnal appeals.

However, because the conference isn’t
until after July 1, 1997, the request for a
deferral could be accommodated. New
yearly budgets are due in July.

Campagna said, “If the Student
Government Board feels that sending ﬁve‘
people to this conference [in Jtﬂy] is nec-
essary, you should overturn the Allocations
decision by approving three, deferring two,
and denying ﬁve delegates. Then, after
July 1, 1997, vote again on the two
deferred requests.”

The Board did exactly as Campagna
suggested. The revision of the request
which Allocations had originally suggest-
ed was denied 0-8, and then a motion for a
revision of Allocations’ suggestion was
made.

The motion was to approve three,
defer two, and deny ﬁve delegates, as had
been previously recommended. The Board
voted unanimously to accept this motion.

As it currently stands, three members
of the GRC, including Adam Neary, will
"spend a week in Madison, “'15., in July.

 ” " ii: FROM PAGE I  i;:,,;
too far from the screen, and after numer-
ous comments like, ‘‘I don’t know ifl can
ﬁnd the comet in this slide,” some of the
audience members took it upon them-
selves to move the projector forward onto
a table on stage. .

In return, Bopp went back through
slides with the audience, stopping and dis-
cussing further the ones they most wanted
to see.

Marian Locke, a Science Center
patron from Ohio, was relieved that Bopp
started over. “We really got our money
worth, especially since he went back and
went over all the slides we couldn’t see
well,” she said.

After some background information
on The Hubble Telescope, astronomy in

general, and the story of Bopp’s famous
discovery, he moved on to present loads of
facts about the comet accompanied by
dazzling amateur photos taken around the
globe. '

He said it was extremely difficult after
the discovery to calculate the trajectory of
the comet’s orbit merely from the three or
four days’ worth of coordinates that
astronomers had accumulated.

They decided to look for the comet in
earlier photos of the same portion of sky,
and Hale-Bopp was identiﬁed on a photo
plate ﬁ'om 1993. It had been overlooked
because it was 1000 times less bright than
it was the night it was discovered.

Soon, the comet’s 23 80-year orbit had
been mapped out, even though its pres-
ence had barely been known a week.

The solid nucleus of the comet has
been measured at 28 miles in diameter.

5

“The nucleus contains over one trillion
tons of ice,” Bopp explained. The comet is
enveloped by a coma (the gas cloud‘sur-
rounding the nucleus) of about 2.5 x 1.5
million kilometers. The tail is a 150 mil-
lion-mile long trail of ions produced by
solar wind, according to Bopp.

When found, Hale-Bopp was 1,000
times brighter than the Ha1ley’s comet
ever was at the same distance, 7.16 AU (an
AU is an astronomical unit —— the distance
between the earth and the sun).

Bopp ﬁnished up his lecture with a
Q&A session and a half—hour autograph
session for literally hundreds of enamored
audience members.

When asked what it’s like to have his
name attached to such a famous celestial
wonder, Bopp paused to think.

“Well,” he ﬁnally said, “It’s wonder-
ful.”

For an all-expense-paid
vacation, call the GRC

Want to see the country for free? Want to have the stu-
dent body pay for you to go to a conference from which you
will return with nothing to show but a silly award that you
can’t explain? Join the SGB’s Governmental Relations
Committee’s USSA bandwagon.

The eight delegates from Pitt who went on the USSA
junket to Washington, D.C., have returned with stories about
the great time they had and with high hopes of going on
another all-expenses-paid — courtesy of your student-activi-
ty fees — USSA vacation in lovely Madison, Wis.

The sad truth of the matter is that eight people went on a
little trip to D.C. to lobby for more student aid. This trip was
supposed to make a tangible difference in the lives of the stu-
dents whose money was used to fund the trip. However, the
happy travelers came back with nothing to offer the students
in return for the trip besides the fact that they had talked to
some people. Talk is cheap, but we paid a heck of a lot to
send those eight students to D.C. — $3,600. Those must’ve
been 50-cent words they were tossing around.

To add insult to injury, the Allocations Committee rec-
ommended and the SGB approved money to be allocated to
the GRC for at least three delegates to go to Wisconsin in
July. The board will wait until July, when the majority of stu-
dents are gone from the campus, to decide whether any more
than the three already approved persons can go on the excur-
sion.
It’s bad enough that the GRC thinks it can jaunt about the
country on our student-activity fees. It is unforgivable for the
Allocations Committee and the SGB to give them our money
without making them bring back any tangible result showing
the trip to be beneficial to the entire student body and not to
just the chosen few who take the joyride to USSAland.

The student body at this University needs to tell
Allocations and the SGB to quit throwing our money around
and letting the merry wanderers of the GRC skip around with
our money in their pockets and a free vacation to do with as
they please. If the GRC wants to goof off in exotic locations,
let them spend their own money to do it, not ours.

The campus sage rambles on 

 

More random thoughts
from this average college stu-
dent:

0 The March issue of The

, Observer, the libertarian—ori-

ented local monthly newspa-
per which covers the city of
Pittsburgh, contained an arti-
cle on campus political cor-
rectness featuring our favorite
conservative activist; Booker
T. Stallworth, Jr. He had the
audacity to suggest that a con-
servative revolution was brew-
ing on campus, using as proof
that a slate backed by The

Phoenix, of which he is pub- I

lisher, won a majority of seats
on the Student Government
Board.

Here’s a question: Since
that paper isn’t exactly well-
respected at either Pitt or
Carnegie—Mellon, had The
Phoenix come right out and
endorsed these particular can-
didates ahead of time (which it
didn’t), would they then have
won? I’m not so sure.

0 You know, I’m getting a little
sick of whining right—wingers
complaining that their view-
point isn’t heard, not only on
campus but nationwide. I’ve
seen what happens when they
do get into power: They tend
to shut everybody else out. For
example, how many liberals
and moderates belong to the
College Republicans? When
was the last time you ever
heard a liberal voice on “The
700 Club?” I’ve never heard
one. And how many liberal
columnists write for the
Tribune-Review? Answer: As
many blacks as there are in the

Ku Klux Klan.

0 Speaking of which, if you’re
black and consider the Nation
of Islam’s Louis Farrakhan to
be a great leader in the black
community, you had better
think again. C. Edward Foster,
the main speaker at the Klan
rally last Saturday, had earlier
in the week praised Farrakhan
and his “bow-tie boys” for
their views on racial separa-
tion, which are pretty much
the same as the KKK’s. That
should tell you something:
Either Farrakhan’s wrong, or
the KKK is right.

Here’s a dirty little secret:

Both groups have had a sort of
kinship that goes back
decades. According to Dinesh
D’Souza’s book “The End of
Racism,” Malcolm X, then the
No. 2 man in the Nation of
Islam, actually met with Klan
leaders in 1961.
- By the way, what would I
have done if I met an active
Klan member that day?
Nothing out of the ordinary --
just talked to him like any
another human being. Which
he is, even though I cannot
accept his views. That’s the
reason I’ve thrived in white
society all these years.

Twelve years ago, I attend-
ed a wedding for a couple of
friends of mine (I have since
become especially close to the
husband), and the wife told me
ﬂat out that her fatherwas “an
Archie Bunker type.” I talked
with him at the reception the
way I would have with any-
one, and she told me later that
he said, “Who was that black
guy — Rick? Yeah, I liked
him.”

- Concerning men’s basketball

center Mark Blount possibly
jumping to the NBA after this
season, I think he’s making a
mistake. It remains to be seen
how many teams would spend
the money to develop him,
since he said money is the rea-
son he’s leaving. No question
he will be a good player even-
tually, but that probably won’t
happen if he leaves now, espe-
cially with 7-fo'ot stiffs being
prevalent in the NBA.
0 Which reminds

where’s Eric Mobley?
0 Back in November, I was
approached in Miami Subs by
a student member of the
Greater Pittsburgh Church of
Christ, which I consider a cult

me-—

and whose parent group, the

International Church of Christ,
I’ve been researching for two-
and.-a-half years. The student
asked me if I wanted to meet
other members of the organi-
zation, and I declined. If
church members really believe
they are doing God’s work,
they could certainly accept
some honest criticism, espe-
cially from someone who
knows the Bible as well as I
do. However, I wasn’t so sure
about how they felt about my
criticism.

0 And one last item: Jerry
Falwell, of the late but hardly
lamented Moral Majority,
once referred to Ellen
DeGeneres, who along with
her TV character declared her
lesbianism last week, as
“Ellen DeGenerate.”
DeGeneres’ response? “I’ve
been getting that since the
fourth grade.” Shows how
childish he is.

Rick Nowlin generally has the
last word.

The only wy to fight hate is with love and prayer

 

The Ku Klux Klan’s message of hatred
cannot be fought with violence but rather
with a plan of love and a decision to step out

-' of our comfort zones and take action. I don’t
 mean passive action, by just condemning the
‘ Klan and hoping they will go away. They
, will not go away, much as our hatred toward
._ any individual just doesn’t disappear. It’s so
‘ easy for us to think, at times, that we should-
' n’t get involved because it’s not us, but some

else, who’s being targeted
When we have attitudes like that, it

it clearly shows our self-centered wills bent on

getting things done our way for our own
pleasure. Instead, I believe we should take
action, speak out on the power of love, and
cany each other’s burdens. When we decide
not to get involved when injustice is occur-
ring, we endanger our own lives in the future.
Who’s to say that you won’t be the next per-

‘sontargetedbyanotherhategroup?

“First, they came for the Jews, and I did-

n’t speak up, because I wasn’t a Jew. Then,

they came for the communists, but I didn’t
speak up because I wasn’t a communist...
'Ihentheycameforme,andtherewas
nobody left to speak out for me,” said Pastor

Martin Niemoller.

Arewegoingtouniteasmembeisofthe
community only when the KKK visits, and
go about our daily business on the other days,
or are we going to be a united community
ﬁghting racism, hatred, and bigotry with the
power of love?

I agree with the sign that read “Injustice
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” I
believe true justice can prevail in our lives
only through understanding the message of
love.

When we start loving each other, there
willbenoroomforhatredwhenwe start
loving those who hate us there will be no
room for
vengeance. I
believe we should
love our enemies
and pray for those
who persecute us.
This means even
showing love to
the members of
the K and
praying that they
will change.

The message
of love was being
armounced by

How do you love someone who has so much
hatred against you and who despises you so
much? How do you show love to that type of
person? Hurnarily spealdng, I believe it is
impossible with our self-centered wills.

I cannot picture anyone wanting to show
love to the KKK But, I saw that one student
stood up for her faith, because she loved

 Jesus Christ so
much and knew
His message of
love could con-
quer through all
this hatred. She
did not ﬁnd the
heart to love them
on her own, but
rather because of
her faith in Christ.

I agree with her
that only through
active love can
we put an end to

Jesus, the Bible
says Jesus said,

Itiseasytobeangiyandwanttogoout
for revenge against those who hurt us and
stepped on what we have stiived to achieve,

but it is hard to love the people who wronged
us. In the end, it’s not our revenge against the
K or any group or individual who
wronged us that will bring. us peace, but
rather our willingness to love and pray for
those who persecute us.

It’s not going to be easy to love the
urilovable, but I believe that what Laura
stood for as she prayed that Jesus would take
their hatred away was an excellent thing, as
the crowd of protesters shouted, “F_ _ _ you,
Klan; f ___you, Klan!”

So where’s the answer? The answer is
not ﬁghting ﬁre with ﬁre. It’s such a common
statement to make, but if we use common

.. sense,wewillrealizethatﬁreshouldnotbe

fought with ﬁre, but rather with a lot of water.
In the same way, I believe that ﬁghting hate
groups with our own kind of hate will not
solve any problems but will only add more
fuel to the tension. We need to ﬁght hatred
with love.

“Love is patient, love is kind It does not
envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not
rude, it is not self—seeking, it is not easily
angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love
does not delight in evil but rejoices with the
truth. It always protects, always trusts,
always hopes, always perseveres” (1 Cor.
1.3).

Big screen and TV stereotypes aren’t
fcloing the black community any favors

 

Every Friday, millions gather in
front of their TVs to watch “Def
Comedy Sham” -—— oops, I mean

“Jam” — on HBO. For those who
wisely avoid the show, it is a stand-up
comedy produced by blacks that gives
(mostly) black comedians a chance to
showcase their alleged talents. It

j begins with a host who pensively rem-

inisces about the good old days in the
“hood.” The comedians are usually
foolishly draped in the latest fashion
garb while doing their best to vulgarly
tell about life in the “hood” as they
perceive it.

What happened to dignity on the
screen? Some movies that I personally
enjoyed were Uptown Saturday Night
and Guess Whois Coming to Dinner.
Many of these shows originated in the
1970s after the civil-rights era, and
through comedy, America visibly saw
its dark side (no pun intended). Now in
the 1990s, these genres have been

replaced by “Martin,” BET’s “Comic
View,” and other trash. Adding to the
ﬁlth are movies such as Friday, Don ’t
Be a Menace to South Central While
Drinking Your Ju ce, etc. We get mad
when we get reminded of the Stepin
Fetchit movies of the 1940s and
19505. (Back then, the only roles avail-
able to blacks were those of sub-
servience and docility.) Now, here in
1997, we can do no better? Don’t give
me the excuse that “we have to inform
people what it’s like in the hood.” That
same excuse was given for gangster
rap. I didn’t buy it then, and I don’t buy
it now.

Comedy is not incessantly calling
each other “niggers” and “motherf_ _
_ers.” Nor is it spending 30 minutes of
prime time acting like imbeciles and
calling women “bitches.” Black
America wants to eradicate these
stereotypes, yet spends billions watch-
ing them on TV and the big screen.
What’s even sadder is how many
young people consciously and uncon-
sciously imitate these stigmas. Many

blacks spend untold amounts on
Tommy Hilﬁger and Nike gear. You
see, they say,we got to look good. But
for what? Where are we going? The
last time I checked, too many of us are
ﬁlling up prisons, not libraries and uni-
versities. The messages that these
degrading movies are supposed to be
sending aren’t reaching the persons
they need to reach. So stop paying
money to see this garbage.

Let’s stop being prisoners to TV

shows, denigrating movies, and falsi-
ﬁed lifestyles. Let’s put our money and
time into what will indelibly and indu-
bitably advance us into the next centu-
ry. Let’s inform these black TV and
movie producers that we will not toler-
ate them using our past as an excuse to
ruin our future! To paraphrase
Malcolm X, “You’ve been had, you’ve
been took...” and you don’t even know
it.

The National
Pastime in

a Winter
Wonderland

 

Snow.

Baseball.

Baseball in the snow: A sentence I
never want to hear uttered again.

Yesterday, I was an eyewitness to
this badgering‘ of baseball by Mother
Nature at Three Rivers Stadium. It
wasn’t an all-out, get-out-of-high-
school-for-a-week blizzard, just the
wet, sleety, makes-you-feel-sick kind
of storm.

I cringed as the sleet seemingly
came out of nowhere to pierce through
the clouds and speckle the fans with
tiny white balls of who-knows-what in
the beginning of the third inning.

After the intense two-minute
tsunami, the Dodger bats woke up and
creamed the Buckos for nine runs in
the top of the third. Now, with the
Pirates down by more than 10 runs,
their only hope was to try and delay
the game long enough for Mother
Nature to return and cancel the game
with another spell of April hail balls.

After the third, the Pirate relief
pitchers were willing to help in post-

poning the game in any way they‘

could, and they ‘did. Starter Jason
Schmidt, who didn’t last past the third
inning, must have given them the low-
down on how to really screw up a ball
game. Although the names of every
Pirate middle reliever elude me, I
remember the group as a bunch of BP
pitch-throwing has-beens.

Well, they can’t even be consid-
ered has-beens, because they never
were anything, and they still aren’t.

They did their jobs. There were
two pitching changes in the third and
another in the fourth. When all tallied,
the first ﬁve innings took two-and-a-

The Pitt football team played its
annual Blue—Gold game Saturday,
the first under Head Coach Walt
Harris.

The contest pitted the offensive
roster, Gold, against the defensive
roster, Blue. On a slippery, rain-
soaked field, redshirt freshman run-
ning back Creg Bethea took an
eight—yard pass into the end zone to

give the Gold team a 38-34 win in’

overtime.

In the Blue-Gold contest, the
offense is awarded seven points for a
touchdown and three points for a
field goal. The defense is awarded
three points for forcing the offense
to punt after only three plays, three
points for forcing a turnover, seven
points for a touchdown, two points
for a safety, and one point for
stalling an offensive drive and forc-
ing a punt.

“It is a good system,” said
Harris. “It gives the defense a fair
chance. A lot of those I’ve been
involved with really kind of penalize
the defense.”

The Blue team took advantage of
the system early and jumped out to

Shorthanded Lacrosse splits weekend series

One of the main problems a club
sport may experience during a long
and brutal season is that they may be
short on players at any given time.

When a team plays Shorthanded,
like the Pitt men’s lacrosse team did
this past weekend, it is a tough task to
overcome that deficit and finish the
game victorious.

In this situation, the team needs
someone to step up and take control of
the game and lead the team to a win.

The Panthers got that type of lead-
ership this past weekend when senior
co—captain Pat Shea registered a hat

trick against West Virginia and senior
attacker Marc Polecritti scored five
goals against Slippery Rock.

However, Shea’s hat trick was not
enough to hold off the rival
Mountaineers on Saturday, resulting
in a 9-6 Pitt loss. But the Panthers
rebounded on Sunday to defeat the
Rockets 9-7 and ﬁnish out the regular
season.

“We just didn’t have enough peo-
ple,”Shea said. “We played the first
quarter of the West Virginia gam
short one man.” '

The Panthers were without fresh-
man Dave Corrado, sophomores
Stephen Love and Tom Evans, and
senior co—captain Rob Heaps, all of

 

whom had prior engagements. The
four have been some of the Panthers’
most consistent players this season.

Since the Panthers were low on
players, Shea and Polecritti picked the
right time to step up.

“Those guys stepped it up when
we needed them most,” junior goal-
tender Dave Travis said.

Last season, Pitt’s victory over
WVU was one of their biggest wins of
the season, and, according to the team,
the loss to a big rival like West
Virginia is hard to swallow.

“The loss to WVU hurts,” Travis
said. “It hurt to go down there and
lose to those hillbillies. We played

half hours to play.

The Japanese marvel, Hideo
Nomo, took the hill for the Dodgers
and from the outset was shaky. The
strikeout king got some Ks, but he
threw 35 pitches in the first inning and
struggled until leaving in the sixth. In
the fourth, the Pirates, realizing that
the game would become official in an
inning, started to smack some solid
hits off Mr. Nomo. The barrage of
bloopers and gappers produced three
runs and pushed the game time to a lit-
tle over two hours heading into the
fifth. ‘

So, with the Pirates pitchers giv-
ing up a ton of runs and hits, and the
Pirate batters assembling some kind
offense, would their ploy to get a
chance at playing a do—over work?

Unfortunately for the Buckos,
their fate would be sealed when the
fifth ended on a Nomo strikeout. Their
attempt had failed, and now there were
still another four innings to play in the
winter-like temperatures.

The nightmare continued for the
fans as the game sleepwalked on. The
Dodgers changed pitchers three times,
and the Pirates for good measure
obliged with another two changes of
their own.

The highlight of the final four
innings was Raul Mondesi getting
thrown out at the plate by rookie left
fielder Midre Cummings. On the play,
Mondesi appeared to slide in under the
tag. The ump saw it clear as day, but

no one blames him for wanting to end

this severely frigid attempt at Major
League baseball.

I would have done the same thing.
If you’re an ump, you don’t get paid
by the hour, so why freeze your scro-
tum off longer than you have to? He’s
safe or out. Who cares? The Pirates are
down by 10 runs in the eighth and
have no chance. Let’s be realistic.

It really didn’t snow that much,
but it was cold. And for me, the
national pastime should be best friends
with summer. I don’t know what it is
about baseball that makes it so hard to
watch when it is cold. Football is all
about the Frozen Tundra of Lambeau
Field and the Ice Bowl. Baseball is
synonymous with sunny day games

‘ and sauna-like summer nights.
The one thought I have on this 1

mystery is that maybe because base-
ball is a slower game, it gives you

more time to think about how freaking

cold you are. At football games, there
is more action and more fan involve-
ment in the game, so less time to think
about your bum on that icy metallic
bench.

an 6-0 lead by forcing Gold to punt
on the first two series of the first
quarter. Gold responded with a nine-
yard run by senior running back
Dwayne Schulters to go ahead 7-6.

But just as momentum began to
shift toward the offense, Gold’s cen-
ter sent a punt snap sailing into the
end zone for a safety, giving Blue an
8-7 lead. From there, Blue went on a
four-possession, 10-point tear, high-
lighted by a thunderous blow from
senior safety John Jenkins against a
vulnerable wide receiver deep in
Blue territory. ,

Gold would answer one more
time in the first quarter. With Blue
leading 18-7, sophomore running
back Hank Poteat bowled his way
into the end zone from six yards out
to make the score 18-14.

With Blue leading 21-14 early in
the second quarter, senior quarter-
back Pete Gonzalez launched a deep
strike to the front corner of the end
zone. Junior tight end John Jones,
backpedaling over the goal line,
made the grab to tie the game at 21-
21.

Blue dominated the remainder of
the half. The defense halted the next
four offensive drives with solid play
at the line of scrimmage, and Blue
took a 27-21 lead into halftime.

The third quarter began with

,'l'I-IE PITT NEWS

more defensive dominance and more
rain. Blue took advantage of the
slippery field and Gold’s difficulties
making cuts on it.

The defensive line made its mark
with excellent play on several series,
including a quarterback pressure by

sophomore defensive lineman
Demond Gibson, and a great run-
stuffing effort by junior defensive
lineman Marlin Young. The third
quarter ended with Blue holding a
31-21 lead.

But, as the rains lifted, the Gold
team went to work. Early in the
fourth quarter, junior quarterback
Matt Lytle drilled a nine-yard touch-
down pass to redshirt freshman
Melvin Porter to close the gap to 31-
28. Lytle finished the day complet-
ing 13 of 22 passes for 148 yards.

As time was running down in the
fourth quarter, Gold drove to within
field—goal range. With under two
minutes to play, junior kicker Chris
Ferencik stepped onto the field and
nailed a 25-yard field goal, tying the
game at 31-31 and forcing an over-
time.

After a brief discussion between
coaches and officials regarding how
the overtime was to be handled, both

line and threw a game-clinching
pass to Bethea for the score.

Gold led 38-31 at that point.
Gonzalez finished the day having
completed 12 of 21 passes for 150
yards, with two touchdowns.

Blue had one last chance. On the
final series of the game, the defense
managed to hold the Gold team to
four downs and a change of posses-
sion, but it wasn’t enough. Blue was
awarded three points, and Gold left
the field with the win.

Several players posted impres-
sive numbers during the contest.
Tight end John Jones led all
receivers in yardage by gaining 83
yards on three receptions. Hank
Poteat was the leading rusher, with
48 yards on 11 carries. Linebacker
Ernest Coakley led the defense by
recording seven tackles and two
sacks.

The coaches were pleased with
the play of the team during the
game.

“Right now I think [the team is]
pretty competitive,” Harris said. “I
thought our defense did a good job
stopping the run today. I think they
did a better job stopping the run than
in any other of our scrimmages.

“We kissed our sister today. It
was that kind of day. It was a very
competitive day.”

pretty upbeat following the game.

“The loss really doesn’t matter
because we already clinched a playoff
spot,” Shea said.

However, the Panthers clinched
the division title with the win over
SRU, despite playing in shoddy
weather.

“The field was muddy, and there
was a mixture of rain in snow,” fresh-
man Brian Pasquini said. “But it was a
fun game, and it was nice to clinch the
division, even though we played pret-
ty bad.”

The win gave the Panthers a ﬁnal
record of nine wins and four losses in
the National Collegiate Lacrosse
League. ' -

The Panthers now look forward to
their rematch with Ohio University on
Saturday night at the Cost Center in
the opening round of the playoffs.

Ohio University dealt Pitt its only
loss at home this season, and the
Panthers are looking for revenge.

“We are all pretty psyched up for
the game against Ohio U.,” Travis
said. “We want to beat them here at
home.” a

The last time Pitt was in the play-
offs was two years ago, when they
won the league championship.

Freeman brings experience to
offensive line and coaching staff

The first shall be last and the last
shallbe ﬁrst. This certainly was the
case when Pitt hired Offensive Line
Coach Tom Freeman. Freeman was the
ﬁnal coach hired by Head Coach Walt
Harris, but the hiring could pay enor-
mous dividends for Pitt’s program.

Freeman played’ center and tackle
at San Diego State University in 1967
and 1968. During his time at San Diego
State, Freeman was part of some extra-
ordinary teams. The Aztecs won the
National Championship in 1967 and
1968, and did it under the tutelage of
legendary NFL coach Don “Air”
Coryell. V

“We were throwing the ball with a
degree of sophistication that nobody
else was,” Freeman said. “We were
really ahead of our time. As an offen-
sive lineman, we were doing things
technique-wise that most other college
linemen weren’t doing. That’s because
we were throwing the ball more, and
with more sophistication.”

Freeman began his coaching career
at Santa Ana College in 1970. In 1974,
he took the offensive line coach posi-
tion at San Diego City College for a
year. In 1975, Freeman entered the
Western Athletic Conference, taking
the offensive line coach position at
Hawaii. .

After ﬁve years at Hawaii, Freeman
accepted a position in the same capaci-
ty with his alma mater, San Diego State
University. Freeman’s time as a coach
at San Diego State indirectly gave he
and Walt Ham's something in common.

“When I moved to San Diego State
in the WAC, I worked for Doug
Scovil,” Freeman said. “[He] had really
put together the Brigham Young pass-
ing game. Boy, it was a great, great
opportunity to work for Coach Scovil,
who ironically was Coach Harris’ col-
lege coach.”

Freeman left to coach the offensive
line at Arizona State in 1984. His time
at Arizona State gave him something
else in common with Harris. Both he
and Harris have coached for current
Ohio State Head Coach John Cooper.

“I remained [at ASU] when John
Cooper came, and we had three straight
bowl games,” Freeman said. “John
Cooper is really a great guy to coach
for, ‘cause he lets you coach. You know
what your expectations are, and you
coach. John’s a ﬁne guy to work for. I
enjoyed working for John.”

While at ASU, Freeman had the
opportunity to coach arguably one of
the finest offensive guards of all time.
Perennial Pro-Bowl guard Randall
McDaniel has spent his NFL career
with the Minnesota Vikings, but spent

 

his college playing days as a Sun Devil.

“We knew he had a chance to be
special,” Freeman said. “We knew he
was never going to be the 285, 290-
pound guy that they’re playing with
now. He made up for it with such ath-
leticism and quickness, and his ability
to run. We felt he had the ability to be a
real fine player.” ’ %

Some of Freeman’s most memo-
rable experiences are from the time he
spent with his ASU lines in practices.

“If I could’ve saved something
from those teams, it would’ve been
practice tapes,” Freeman said. “Just to
show kids how they practiced. They
practiced the way you’re supposed to
practice — they gave great effort and
worked to get good. They could ﬂat
practice, boy, I mean really practice.”

Freeman moved to Purdue as offen-
sive line coach in 1992, and stayed until
he was offered the Pitt job this spring.
The offer from Harris was attractive to
Freeman for several reasons.

“First of all the new emphasis
here,” Freeman said. “The new athletic
director and the new head coach, and
then later, I found out the chancellor
was new. Then, coach Harris’ reputa-
tion, of course we’ve known each other.
And my wife’s from Pittsburgh  so
that made the move easy.”

Freeman works hard to maintain a
good relationship with his players,
something that hasn’t gone unnoticed to
others involved with Pitt’s football pro-
gram.

“I think Tom has a great sensitivity
to his players,” said Jim Earle, assistant
athletic director for football operations.
“He’s demanding, but yet he knows
what motivates each one. I think the
kids love him, and that’s a tricky thing
to do sometimes, to get a kid’s respect
and motivate and at the same time have
them really enjoy playing for you. I
think he does an excellent job of that.
And I think the players realize that he
cares about them. So even though he
may push them and be demanding, they
know that he really honestly cares
about them as individuals.”

Freeman’s love of the kids he
coaches and his love of the game that
he coaches are as much a part of Tom
Freeman, the man, as they are of Tom
Freeman, the coach.

“Obviously, to get into this aspect
[of football], it gets in your blood,”
Freeman said. “Watching guys make
strides for the four or ﬁve ‘years, and
watching kids come in as freshmen and
graduate, there’s a big thrill to that. And
of course the Saturday afternoons.
There’s nothing like a big-time college
football game. As a coach and a fan,
college football is a real experience.
That Saturday afternoon, that’s a spe-
cial time.”

and I lost all the break points
thatl had.”

“We were hitting the ball
back and forth very hard, but
she came up with big shots
on big points.”

Due to the Big East’s
scoring system, number-one-
seed Davis had her match
suspended with Walker lead-
ing 1-0. Jennifer Bible’s
sixth-seed match with Karin
Flaig was suspended with
Bible trailing 6-1, 4-1, and
Hoffman’s second-seed
match with Firestone was
cancelled.

Georgetown proved to be
as tough of an opponent as
West Virginia.

“They’re excellent,” said
Kalesnik, who lost 6-2, 6-3
to her Hoya opponent.

“It was a horrible loss for

me. I made a lot of errors
that I don’t usually make.”

“All of the games went to
deuce?’

In singles, Davis went

down, 6-2, 6-2. Hoffman and
Gang dropped their matches
as well, as Bible and Bucher
saw their leads go to waste
after the Hoyas took out their
teammates.
_ “We won some games
and were competitive,” said
Dieffenbach. “We ’ just
weren’t able to win any
sets.”

“We fought hard and
played 100 percent. We gave
it everything we had, but we
faced tough opponents.”
