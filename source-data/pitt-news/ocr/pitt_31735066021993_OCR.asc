Liabilityhinders escort plans

By Brendan Walsh

For The Pitt News _

Before the Student. Govern-
ment Board’s proposition of an

escort service can be implement— '

ed, the issues of liability and stu-
dent interest must be addressed,
according to 5GB member
George Kontos.

”Legal liabilities [are] one of
the main concerns,” said Kontos,
who is currently working on the
project. Kontos said a disclaimer,
which students would read and
sign, would relieve the universi-
ty from legal liabilities and
responsibilities.

”The disclaimer could be the
answer to the legal aspect in-
volved,” Kontos said. J

A polling service is currently

being conducted by the Fresh-
man Council. ”We’re polling ap-

proximately 200 students to see-

if they would like.to see a serv-
ice established and if they will
use it,” Kontos said. The survey
has not yet been completed.

Planning ofthe escort service
began six months ago, when
former SGB member Rob Ardiz-
zi proposed the plan last Septem-
ber. Kontos took over the project
from Ardizzi when he took office
in January and has been working
on the project since then.

Freshman Joanna Samuelson»

said of the escort service, ’’I think
it would be a plus. I'm a little
wary about walking home alone
at night.” 1

Pitt Theatre looking

‘Staff Writer

The students and faculty in

Pitt's theatre arts department are
finding out how tough the road
to stardom can be.
_ The theatre arts department is
in dire need of space and reno-
vations. Some work has been
done in the Cathedral basement
to alleviate some of the depart-
ment’s immediate problems.

Classroom and rehearsal room
B16 was recently renovated to
help accomodate the need for
space. New offices have also

been built in the basement for the

_,faculty and graduate students.

Other renovations have been pro-
posed, but no money has been al-

located for them yet.

According to W. Richardson
Howe, associate dean for ad-
ministration, ”Every academic
unit would like to have more
space, and we-would like to give
it to them. Unfortunately, space
is a limited commodity. There-
fore we have to work within the
space of the university.”

Dr. .Atillio Favorini, chairman
of the theatre arts department,
said he appreciates all the help

something that's dependable and
adequate for student needs.”

Another student, Rose Weaver,
a junior, said,-”l’m not usually in
the position where I'd have to
walk home alone, but if I were,
I would make use of the escort
service.”

Kontos would like to see the es-
cort service set up in conjunction

with a university departmentor a

work/study program. He plans on
presenting the project to higher
university officials within the next
month.

Ardizzi started researching the
Urban 13 plan to obtain informa-
tion from 13 other universities
whose environments are similar
to Pitt's. ’

Kontos said he would like to

that has been given to his depart-
ment, but there are still many
problems.

’’Dealing with those immediate
problems is not a long-range so-

lution,” said Favorini. ”We don't

have enough space, and the

‘ space that we have is below stan-

dard and undermines our aca-
demic mission.

”Ten years ago, we sent in our
first completedetailed proposal
to solve our space problems,”
said Favorini, ”and we have been
basically ignored. Putting us in
the basement was meant to be
short range. But we've been here

CM U senate reverses  
decision on funding   

By Dirk Kaufman .

Managing Editor

The student senate at Carnegie
Mellon University voted last
night to reinstate funding for the
Student_ Union, a publication
funded by the student activities

‘ fee at that university, reversing

their decision of a week ago.
‘The senate had voted to dis-
continue funding the publication
after finding fault with two arti-
cles printed in the Feb. 26 edition
of the publication.
The first article concerned a

, story. in which the Student Union

allegedly suggested that the Pitts-
burgh Post—Gazette had chosen
not to do a story concerning

‘CMU after the university had

pressured the paper not to do so.

The second issue involved the
alleged use of sections of_a story
printed in the New York Times
without the permission of that
papen , V

The Senate voted to reverse the
decision on the stipulation that
the Student Union pay for infor-
mation used in a story allegedly
taken from the New York Times
concerning the use of anti-
ballistic missiles.

Over 50 persons attended the
meeting T of the senate, many
wearing multi-colored, tie—dye T-
shirts to signify their allegiance to,
or affiliation with, the Student
Union.

It was also announced by the

-senate that one person, or a

group of persons, would be
named by the Student Union as
a representative of the paper.

The publication does not name
any editors, and members of the
senate said part of the problem
was that no one was available to
contact concerning the senate’s
grievances. A

According to Nona Gerard, a
third year MFA student, problems
arose during rehearsals for Crease
last fall because of inadequate fa-
cilities.

”We had no place to rehearse
except in what is called the social
room, which has a very hard con-
crete floor just covered with
linoleum,” said Gerard. ”This
kind of cement jams your knees
_and throws your back out.”

WASHINGTON  The Reagan

E  I administration, operating undera

court order that condemned past
government inaction, moved

- Monday to require farms to begin
V «providing toilets, drinking water

and other sanitation facilities to

‘ field workers.

After years of legal wrangling,
the new standards requiring field
toilets, handwashing and drink-
ing water facilities for half a mil-
lion farm workers could be in
place in six weeks, said Labor
Secretary William E. Brock.

”We plan to move as expedi-
tiously as possible,” Brock said.
”Barring unforseen develop.-
ments during a 20-day comment
period, we will issue a standard
by the end of April.”

In October 1985, Brock
reversed a finding by his
predecessor Raymond Donovan

'  that federal standards were not

needed. However, as a preferred
option to federal regulation, he
gave states 18 months to come up

' with rules of their own to address

the unacceptable health risks

posed by the lack of such fa-
cilities.

separatehimself from his rivals
for the nomination, Babbitt pro-
posed increasing the tax on So-

higher-income Americans, cap-

Anth ropologist says ltural Iy promoted   , 

By Ted Duncombe

Associated Press Writer '

PHILADELPHIA — An anthro-
pologist, who six years ago
challenged the view that rape is
inherent to the male nature, has
now more sharply defined what
makes some societies ”rape
free.”

The Minangkabau people of
West Sumatra have strong tradi-

sor at the University of Penn-
sylvania.

By Grace Finke
For The Pitt News

The nation's businesses want
interns, but few students know
the benefits of an internship or
how to go about finding one.

The problem is that too many

people,_including some universi— -

ty administrations, have thought
' internships were not very impor-
tant to career development. Ac-
cordingly, for years the University
of Pittsburgh's internship office

' has not had a full-time staff.

Internship

Such factors help explain why
West Sumatra had just 28 report-
ed rapes among three million
people during 1981-82, Sanday
suggested in a recent paper,
”Rape and the Silencing of the
Feminine,” which appears in the
book, Rape.

”Contrary to popular American
belief, men are not human ver-
sions of predatory jungle beasts,”
Sanday wrote. ”Although power-
ful, the sex drive does not chan-
nel behavior in the absence of
social encoding._”'

Sanday compared the 28 rapes
in West Sumatra to the 82,000
”founded” rapes reported during

This difficulty, according to
Nancy Israel, director of the In-
ternship Office at Pitt, has been
corrected. Since the summer of
1986, the internship office has
had a full time—staff and a perma-
nent location on the ninth floor
of the Cathedral of Learning.

Serving an internship enables
students to acquire practical
knowledge in the career they
hope to have, without the pres-
sure of holding down a job.

Joanna Patterson, a senior com-
munications major, wanted to see

1980 in the“'Un‘itedfStates‘ ‘and
said such factors as pornography
and a hierarchical social structure
contribute to making America a
rape—prone society.

”We have the idea about male
sexual nature that if it's aroused,
it has to be satisfied, or there's an
explosion,” she said in an inter-
view. ’’I think one lesson from
my work is that we have to think
very seriously about our models
for _human behavior. What are
our images of male sexual be-
havior and female sexual be-
havior?”

Such institutions as fraternities

”We’ve got to look into fraterni-
ties, and we've got to look into
the animal models that they. pro-
vide for sexual behavior.”

‘ Sanday, who has also written
on cannibalism, said her study of
rape-free and rape-prone socie-
ties grew out of research for her
1981 book, Female Power and
Male Dominance. Her study of

.women’s sex roles and status in

156 tribal societies included rape
as one of the quantifiable factors.

She then decided to study a
rape-free‘ society in depth ”to
gain a morethorough under-
standing of the philosophical un-

communications,” she said.
”You have to be one up on them,
and it's an excellent way to
learn.” Patterson added, T’But a

chose the Minangkabau of West
Sumatra because of the cultural
importance of women in stories,
legends, the system of descent
and the [economic] system."

Sanday first went to the Indone- A I

sian province on the island of

Sumatra in the summer of 1981. .

She said she didn't know the lan-
guage or anyone in West Sumatra
at the time, but she has returned

related professions. Some intern-

Racism is still an

issue at colleges

In many parts of the country, college officials are attempting
to elucidate the impetus behind the current wave of racist
thought on college campuses. ’

Two weeks ago, at the University of Michigan, a disc jockey.

was fired from his_job at the university—supported radio station
for telling racist jokes on the air —— no small wonder.

In Long Beach, N.J., city employees are prohibited from tell-
ing ethnic jokes of any sort in city buildings. The ordinance
stems from a suit filed by a city policewoman, asserting that
she had been the victim of racial slurs.

Across the country, there is an awareness the problem of ra-

cism, and voices are beginning to be heard. .
'_ At Pitt, we have not been without racial tension. Last fall,
Oakland was the object of clamoring media coverage during

the weekend war zone period.
Attention has been drawn to the problem, and there are sig-

i . nificant strides being made. If nothing_else, stories such as those

from’ the University of Michigan and New Jersey catch our in-

terest, they cause us to speak up, they draw our outrage.
The tide of racism is turning, but we arestill far from the fi-

nal solution to our problems. At Pitt, the incidence of violence

has gone down, and it might be nice — if a little unrealistic .

— to assume our hatred has subsided as well.

We-are moving in the right direction, but it is important to
realize that we are farfrom doing well.- We can learn from the
racial tension in Ann Arbor. We can learn that the only way
to have peace within a community is for all the members to
get along with each other, regardless of race.

Pitt is doing well, happily, and with some luck, we will
conﬁnue. »

Reagan's officials

should take the rap

Officials working for.a special committee investigating the

' ‘” Iran-Contra affair are still poring over the evidence surround-

ing the scandal, trying to decide if criminal charges are in order

"for Reagan administration officials. A
They have already granted immunity to Fawn Hall and are '

considering immunity for others who could ”shed new light

' on the case.” Oliver North and William Casey have refused

to testify. 1

Why are we, as citizens, so willing to close our eyes to yet
another travesty in American justice? Have we been so
thoroughly jaded by the events of recent months?

If the commission ﬁnds evidence that the law has been broken

 at theupper levels of the government, let those responsible stand
trial as any-other person. Sadly, there is the possibility that the

investigation will be blown out of proportion, creating chaos,
Inviting controversy, making reputations. We are not so far re-
moved from Watergate to forget the celebrities of epic propor-
tion created by a simple breach of law.

We would do well to remember that our officials are not
celebrities, they are servants —— civil servants. If we elect them
to make and enforce the laws, they should be the first to suffer
for breaking those laws. They are not heroes, they are not gods.

They represent us, all of us. If there are any" guilty of fraud, let

them be punished.

A letter from the big guy

Not long ago, famed television
evangelist Oral Roberts stated
that if he did not receive $8 mil-
lion in contributions by March
31, God was ”going to call him
home.”

Well, it's almost time.

With all of the speculation sur-
rounding Roberts’ ”impending”
death or ”benevolent salvation”
depending upon how receptive
the general public turns out to be,
you would have to wonder what
is going to happen to Roberts.

But, before any more specula-
tions can be made, you have to
decide whether this is a question
of faith or a question of ”how the
hell am I going to raise $8
million.”

Once you have come to the

logical and only sane conclusion
that this is, without a doubt, a
question pertaining to mis-
managed funds, you will have no
problem believing what I am
about to reveal to you.
Ordinarily, I would be skepti-
cal of Roberts’ claim that God
visited him. However, on the
very same day that God visited

Roberts’ word that God came to
see him, I have concrete proof
that He came to visit me.

He left, in my care, a letter that
will clear up this whole ”save
yourself by saving me  send me
cash” mess that Roberts’ cooked
up. '

The letter went like this.

My dearest children,

I gave you the gift of free will
for a purpose. My original inten-
tion was to empower you with
this ability so you would be able
to make intelligent decisions.

Does using a television
preacher as proof that there is a
God constitute an intelligent
choice? Be honest with yourself:
What do you want to see happen
to Oral?

Love,
A God

Suppose Roberts receives the
$8 million that he asked for. He
gets to retain his mortal life as he
claims the bargain allowed. If he

I lives, what does that prove? Does

that prove the existence of God?
It doesn't disprove it. Maybe this
stunt proves the value of the
almighty dollar. ’

Should he die on March 31,
what effect will that have on you?
Will that ”strike the fear of the
Lord” into you? I think not. It's
too easy to find other explana-
tions for his death.

The thingsthat take a human
life aren't always as pretty as ”be—
ing called home." Suicide and
murder are two such ends. And
Roberts’ never clarified how he is
supposedly going to die. _

I say, let him die. What pur-
pose does his claim serve? It will
never prove anything. It will pro-
vide " a lot of unsatisfactory
answers. ' '

Before March 31, I'd like to
know one thing. Regardless of
whether Roberts lives or dies,
what is going to happen to all of
that cash? - '

Columnist is voice of honesty

The Pitt News has aquired a
voice of honesty and intelligence
— Mr. Marc Duchin. -Mr. Duchin,
your last piece, ”A little personal
strength,” . was well-written,
morally inspiring — in short, ex-
cellent —— from beginning to end.

If you keeplup the high quality

a compelling reason to pick up

Philosophy

A different thing has happened
in this last generation beginning
in 1953, which the King James
Bible refers to as the latter days
—— TV evangelism! Never before
has preaching reached so many

rible results: Lying and stealing

of their lifeless bodies are kept in
big-city morgues awaiting.ide1n-
tification. The state, churches and
the media have zeroed in on
equality as the solution but, in
fact, it is equality which has
ruined life for us all.

And with world terrorism, it's
perceived inequality that causes
it. But the best way to end ter-
rorism —. especially intellectual
— along with the bloodsucking
business monopolies and moron-
ic brotherhoods, is to go back to
square-one and start over. But the
government isn't about to just let
slavery end. _

But even though the IRS will
hate it, a person can park their car
and use a bicycle exclusively. It's

' the second step for being born

again, for motor vehicle emis-

., sions are deadly: ,”For we die
:-from their toxic fumes in -a great

number of ways, from new life in
women's wombs to a violent
shortening of days.” ’

But the first and most urgent
change needed is an attitude. It
goes back to Genesis 1:27, ”So
God created. man in his own im-
age ” But man turned it around
and created God in his own im-
age, that is, putting long hair and
a gown on Jesus. Then he creat-
ed the Prince of this world by put-
ting pants on women.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March ll, I987

Whatreally is the issue?

Patrick Henry once said, ”I dis-
agree completely with what you
say, but I will defend to the death
your right to say it.” With regard
to Carnegie Mellon University's
recent controversy over the Stu-
dent Union,. this aphorism might
be amended to ”I will defend
your right to freedom of speech,
but not absolve you of A your
responsibility to‘ face the -conse-.

, quencesof 'yourw'ords.’.” ‘ '

CMU’s student senate yester-
day reversed a decision to» revoke
funding for the = alter_n‘a.tive
newspaper. A vlaUdfable'decision,
since the revoking of the Student

. Union's funding smacks strongly

of censorship. . Q

I am no advocate of censorship
in any way, shape or form; the
Student Union should be permit-
ted to say whatever the ”non-
editors” deem appropriate. The
”non—editorsv," ’ however, have
seemed not to realize the ramifi-
cations of reckless journalism. I

In one incid"ent? cited‘: at‘=yester-

. day's student. sentate meeting; the



  

Student Union :s.u-ggestedt that a

Pitsburgh Post-Gazette reporter

was pressured by the-»uni_versity
administration notto write a sto-
ry that would reflect unfavorably
upon CMU. The charge was un-
substantiated; and the reporter

might have had a solid case for

libel.   

The Student Union was also
charged with reprinting a story
from the New ‘York Times
without permission and presuma-

 
  
  
    

    'rEIl;E$A

 I    cAunoIu 

bly without intention of payment.

tle on payment of a fee, the Stu-
dent Union might have had
another lawsuit on its hands-

Aside from ‘ protecting thee

newspaper from lawsuits, the-Stu-

dent Union must also face‘ the I . _ . _ .
- . fine points. It provides a forum for

probl-em‘ of credibility.

In its-,six_months of existence,
the Student Union has ~ already-

faced the possiblily of two court I
cases. If the paper continues to. ’
follow. such a trend, it will des- -

troy its own capacity to maintain
the trust of its readers.

Consider last_ month's story
regarding Darrel Van Mastrigt,
the CMU student accused of stab-
bing to death Robert Morris Col-
lege student Jeanne Goldberg.
The story suggested that Van
Mastrigt and Goldberg were not
alone on the night of the murd-

     

er, and implied that their com-
panion may have committed the
murder, rather than Van Mastrigt.

The,_use of anonymous sources
is a controversial issue; however,
they are usually used to enhance
a story based on substantiated in-

. formation.

_ _§ A. The story reported that the skin

.: under Goldberg's ﬁngernails had
allegedly not matched Van Mas-'
trigt’s. ‘Had the ‘non-editors‘ le'g‘al-T
- --lye confirmed -this information,“

't_h_e’y;_vmight have had a basis for

‘ b_ri:n'ging to light the testimony of

their. anonymous sources.
The day after the story was

I published, Van Mastrigt admitted '
Had the Times ‘not decided to set- V .

to policethat he was guilty of the
murder, further damaging the Stu-
dent Union's credibility and cast-

_ing a dubious light ‘on the

reliablility of its anonymous
sources. I

The Student Union has many

al.ternative viewpoints and issues
not addressed in other student’

-- newspapers. It is also one of the
' -few area newspapers wh_ich pub-
-lishes original poetry. But what
I will these better qualities matter

after the Student Union has com-
pletely destroyed its credibility as
a result of its reckless policies?

The Student Union has some-
thing interesting going. The stu-
dent senate was right to reinstate
its funding. But the Student Un-
ion must change its careless ways
if it is to become a legitimate
voice of the student community.

Fuller had a better view

The curious opinion of Richard
Buckminster Fuller is that there
will be enough resources for all
life on Earth and that war will be’
obsolete in thenext century. This
essential proposition seems "ab-
surd only to historians, or those
operating from‘ historical assump-

tions about the human enterprise. -

The following tale represents
what I feel is a collision of histor-
ical perspectives when confound-

technologies, that provide valua-

  Looking forthe

GQ men-tality

v Denise Stanfa, 27, who is
a sales representative for a
corrugated box company in
Dallas, describes herself as
a ”fun addict.” 4 _

,”My life is. devoted to
thinking up ways to pursue
different avenues that will '
provide-me withvfun activi-
ties," she said-.‘

So last summer, before a
vacation tripuwith seven
women friends, she came
up with. an idea.

”We' were, going to a
place in Delaware called
Dewey Beach,” she said. E

      



”Dewey Beach is always covered with some of the most beau_- _l
tiful men you would ever want to see in your life. I'm not an  V. ,_ 
ugly person, but I'm not a knockout, either. Normally I— would _

never have a chance to meet men like that.”

Thus, before leaving Dallas for Delaware, Stanfa went to. a   in 

company that makes business cards.

”It was just the local Quick-Print shop,” she said. ”I had thern A _- 
printup business cards that said my name was Muffin Hard-.5 
groveand that I" was vice president of‘ the talent division of Gen- "

tlemen’s‘ Quarterly magazine.” I .

The minimum order was 250 cards for $25, so Stanfa left the ‘  I I

shop with 250 cards.’ _ V ~.
“There had been several times in the past when I had: posed-

as being someone I wasn’t,” she‘ said. ”Once, I said I was a- ‘ '  '

stand-up comic. Once, my sister said she was a criminal law-

yer. Once,‘my friend said that she was an artist. It's kind of fun, _ l 

stepping into another role for a few days."

On the plane ride north, Stanfa handed her new business card‘  ,2  

to the two men sitting. next to her.

”They were pretty impressed,” she said. ”That helped me
make up my mind that when I got to Dewey Beach, I was real-
ly going to be Muffin Hardgrove of GQ_.”

Stanfa and her seven friends arrived in Dewey Beach and im-
mediately began searching for the best-looking men they could
find. '

”I would walk up to the men,” she said. ”I would hand them.
my card and say GQ was planning a spread on the handsomest

men on the beaches on the East Coast. One of my friends would

have a camera set up on a tripod, and I would ask these men
.to come with me and pose.”
Without exception, they did.

“Some of these men were absolute 10s,” Stanfa said. ”I had.  
no illusions —- they would never have looked at me in any situ'-   - » _._
ation. But because they thought I could get them ‘into GQ, they   

would do anything I said. ‘ r ~ A
- ”I_t was really something. These were very macho, beautiful,
gorgeous hunks of men who were as egotistical as they .were

good-looking’ — the kinds of men.who would never let them-.; f;  " ':_~-T1;
selves be seen on the beach with anyone less than a bronzedf-V 3}  — -

sex goddess. —

’’Sometimes,- in fact, a man would be sitting with a woman.   '  L
And I wouldwalk up and give. the man my GQ card-.- As soon  r -‘ 

as the woman saw whatwas going on, shewould sayito the
man. ‘Do it-. Do-_ it!’ And. the man would walk off with..me.’_’.

Before too long, _Stanfa and her‘ entourage had become the A _" ll 

center of'att_ention at, Dewey Beach.’

”We' _would;be‘ walking to our c_ars at the end of theiday, and ,. .1;

 THE pm’ NEWS;"Wéclnesday, March 11, 1987

.--I,

, Ripped jeans are chic in
some circles these days. If you
have the urge to put a different
flare into your fashion —— let-'s

. say, bullet holes — you

needn't worry about how _to go

. , about it. Patty Ludwin will do
it for you;

As part of the American mar-
keting flare that has given us
the pet rock, Wayfarer sun-
glasses and pre-washed denim,
Ludwin of Canonsburg, Pa., is
offering jeans with bullets shot

‘ through them.

f’They really are cute holes,”
she said. ”I’m going to shoot

' A them myself.”

Ludwin said she got the idea
for the jeans last September '
and'is still in the process of
getting them marketed and

0 - finding the best method to

manufacture the product.
She also markets a whole
line of bullet-related jewelry

idea for the jeans came from a .

friend of hers.

”She was. angry with her
boyfriend andwanted to shoot
holes in his jeans, threatening 7
him that the next time she shot
them, he would be in them,” .
Ludwin said. ”We hung the

- jeans up in a tree and each

took a few shots. When we
took them down, I looked, at

them and said, ’You know,

III

these are cute.

She runs the business entire-
ly out of her own home. The.
majority of her work now
revolves around manufacturing
the bullet—fashioned jewelry.
She said the jewelery is sold
without gunpowder or the caps

. which ingnite the powder.

Her method for cap removal

- was admirable, if not a little

crazy.
”One night, desperately

ble to find ‘anyone with a gun,
I thought to myself, ’There
must be another way to get
these caps off.’ I took out my
frying pan, added one 22-long
rifle bullet ‘shell, _cap-side .
down, turned the heat on high
and ran from the ‘room. Bang!
It worked.”

Ludwin said bullet manufac-
turers won’t give her the
bullets sans gunpowder and
caps, so she must do it herself.
She breaks apart and reassem-
bles the bullets for her jewelry.-

. She focuses on the wild west

— idea when marketing. _She said

she is not a violent person and
does not want to be construed

as such.

”As I thought about the
problem, I realized that wear-
ing the bullet is not violent, in
fact, much to the contrary,”
she said. ”|.then decided to
use my bullets as a symbol of
peace.”

She said the business is
slowly growing and that she
has hundreds oflorders for the
jeans still in‘ production —
waiting to be gunned down.

At one point her bills were
mounting more quickly than
the money was rolling in, but
now she said the month-to-
month budget is now starting
to even out.

She sounded a little down
about what she had accom-
plished thus far. Apparently
there is a price to be paid
when shooting jeans point
blank.

The obvious question is:

Why not shoot your own
jeans?

One of the answers lies in
the fact that people once
bought rocks packaged and
promoted as pets rather than
walking out their front door,
picking one up and declaring
it a pet.

The other is perhaps that a

person would look a little silly ,\

standing in a field somewhere

wearing only underpants as he
pumped slug after slug into a
defenseless pair of jeans.

Ludwin’s reasoning lies in
making-ea little cash on an idea
that is slightly nuts but-
definitely marketable.

Steven Jobs did it with his
Apple computers, Michael
Jackson did it with one se-
quined glove. Patty Ludwin,
with the right timing and some
decent marketing, could pull it
off too.

means himself and everyone he
is associated with. His masculin-
ity is ridiculed, and he faces as-
sault, perhaps death, or he might
be driven from his village, never
to return,” she wrote.

Minangkabau treatment of
women stems directly from their
view of nature as a teacher, San-
day said in the interview. ”They

A see life comes from the female in

nature and thus want to‘ give im-
portant roles to women.”
Among the Minangkabau,
women inherit ancestral property
and men must leave the maternal
home for a period of migration
called a ”rantau.” This separation
allows the men to break away
from maternal dependency in a
way that does not require ritual
dominance of women or mas-
culinization of female qualities,

she wrote.

”Silencing the feminine is not
necessary for becoming a proud
and independent male in
Minangkabau society,” she said.

Furthermore, Minangkabau
symbolism is rich with such mo-
tifs as the fern leaf tendril, Sanday
wrote. ’’If vulnerability is valued

‘culturally, then it need not be

hidden or silenced,” she said.
For comparison, Sanday noted
that in rape-prone societies, rape
sometimes becomes a way of
keeping women from interfering
with male—dominated rituals.
Among the Mundurucu people of
South America, women who ac-
cidentally see the tribe's sacred
trumpets face the threat of gang
rape, she wrote. ”Men rape

women when they are threatened

with the loss of their culturally
constructed maleness," she said.

Aidsand the Catholicpriest?

By Marc Humbert

Associated Press Writer

ALBANY, ‘NY. —— Cardinal
John O'Connor said there's ”an
almost morbid curiosity” about
priests and sex ‘in the wake of
reports that some clerics may
have contracted AIDS.

O'Connor made his comments
at a news conference with the
bishops of New York state's
seven other Catholic diocese.

The Roman Catholic leaders
were in the state capital for their
first joint public policy forum, a
conference that attracted nearly
2,000.

While the Roman Catholic
leader said the media's coverage
of the church is generally fair,
O'Connor said that ”right now,
there's what seems to me to be

”An internship is a career plan-
ning tool,” said Israel. ”lt’s areal
chance to expand what you have
learned in college to make your’s
a marketableidegree.”

An internship begins with a
visit to the Cathedral to look

through 15 books of current in— .

ternship sites. A student may
choose as many sites as they wish
to contact.

” We tell them, don’-t limit
yourself. This is a free service. Ap-
ply to as many as you like, then
make a decision,” Israel said.

Students are asked to write a
resume and a cover letter to the

organizations of their choice.
Several sample resumes are on
file at the Internship Office.
”Our office has an agreement
with the Career Training Office,"
said Israel. ’’If a student will get
his resume together, Career
Training will critique it. We work
closely with the Career Training
Office, because we feel that in—
ternships are career training.”
Not all internships are acquired

through the Internship Office.-
Some are through the English '

writing department, under the
direction of Tim Zijaukas and
coordinator Liz Perry. Some are
self-designed, with students find-

ing them on their own.

munications major, found her

an almost morbid curiosity about
the actual and alleged sexual
practices of our priests."

’’If I believe some of the
newspapers and some of the ar-
ticles I read, I'd fear for my safe-
ty here right now because I'm
sitting with seven other bishops
who have nothing in mind but to
assault me sexually," O'Connor
said. ”And that's the kind of ab-
surdity that's being bandied
about in some sectors of the press
now.”

O'Connor said he knew of no
priests working for his diocese
who had AIDS.

AIDS is most often a disease
that affects homosexuals and in—
travenous drug users.

O'Connor and the bishops
were in Albany to lobby for a
54—item legislative agenda, but
much of the news conference

centered__o_n sex issues.
”We believe that the remedy

that is suggested by some of offer-

ing condoms only multiplies the
problem [and] further builds up
the presumption that we can do
whatever we wish with sex,” said
Bishop Stanislaus Brzana of the
Ogdensburg Diocese. "We be-
lieve that the best remedy is the

remedy which is proposed in the .

Bible.” A

Brzana said sex should be
reserved for marriage. ‘

Albany Bishop Howard Hub-
bard said the bishops were hold-
ing their forum and the news
conference to generate publicity
for their positions.

”Perhaps we haven't used the

media and the press  as well as

‘ we should have- to tell our story,”

Hubbard said.

At a luncheon, O'Connor and:

the bishops were joined by Gov.
Mario Cuomo, state Senate
Majority Leader Warren Ander-
son and other state officials.

For The Pitt News

From August of 1984 to August
of 1986, a phasing out of the
Office of Continuing Education
put non-traditional students at Pitt
on their own.

Last August, the program was
re—ins_tituted in the College of Arts
and Sciences and is now helping
these students to enter college

if life.

According to Nancy Israel,
director of the CAS Continuing
Education Program, a non—tradi
tional student is someone who
did not enter college directly af-
ter high school. This includes
anyone over 25 or anyone out of
high school for six to seven years.

Israel was hired to re—institute
the Office of Continuing Educa-
tion in the CAS Dean's Office.

. who were non—traditiona|," said

Israel. ”When she [the previous
director] retired two years ago,
the office was phased out. I was
hired this ‘past August to re-

institute the. office under just

CAS.”

She added, ’’I help the Admis-
sions Office in deciding if non-

traditional people can come into

Pitt. Once a student has been ac-
cepted, I do their advising and
counseling as opposed to an Ad-
vising Center adviser. They stay
with me until they declare a
major.” Israel's background is in
counseling.‘

Israel hosts weekly bag—lunches
for adult students, ”so they can
get together and be in a commu-
nity of adults like themselves,”
she said. ’’I run stress-
management workshops, time-
management workshops and test-
anxiety workshops for adult stu-
dents. So [everything] is particu-
larly geared to their specific
needs.

”I’ve set up a networking sys-
tem so that adults who are all
psych. majors will get together
and network. One thing that
adult students miss on a campus
like this is they _don’t belong to
fraternities,,they don't belong to
sororities, and they don't live in
the dorms. So the kind of net-
working that traditional students
do through campus activities, to
know what's a good course and
what's not, these people tend to
miss out on that part,” Israel said.

Israel pointed out that there are

' a number of different reasons for -

non-traditional students to enter
the university. ”One is the unem-
ployment. Working in the steel
industry or some industry that has

ple off often forces people to
return to school.”

James Devine, 29, a communi-
cations major who waited nine
years to attend college, entered
Pitt in September of 1985. He
said, ’’I went back basically be-
cause I felt I needed a college
degree that would [translate] into
more money.” -

He said he believes it was a
good experience to work before
returning to college.

”I regret that I'm not well off
financially, but I don't regret the
years that I did work,” he said.
He attributed his serious attitude
toward his studies to his work ex-
perrence.

Israel agreed that it is good for
a person to get some work ex-
perience before attending col-
lege. ”I wish America had
something to do with 18-year-
olds for a year that would not
make them go to college until
they were at least_ 20. I think
everybody would do a lot’ better
then,” she said.

”|:ven the students who do
well would do better having a
year of,” she speculated. ”My
theory is that some people do not
do well because they don't have
a goal. Once they have a goal,
they do well,” Israel added.
”Most of these people are hoping
that with a college degree they
will be more employab|e.”

Israel said that although the
Continuing Education Program
has done much to aid non-
traditional students, ”A lot of stu-
dents arein the system without
my being aware of them because
they got in before I got here. Peo-
ple are not totally aware that I am
here. I dovknow [the number of
non-traditional students] will in-
crease in the next few years.

Israel said that before the pro-
gram was re-instituted, ”people
were afraid of how big the univer-
sity that they would feel so alone
here becauseit is a huge univer-
s-ity with many traditional
students.”

She added, ”I think now that

we have a service to offer, .it helps
cut down the image of it just be-
ing a large and impersonal
university because there is one
place to go that you feel comfort-
able with.”

”We receive a few calls a month

calling it a ”desperate” effort to
derail a criminal investigation.

Walsh, noting that the suit was
the second challenge to his inves-
tigation in lldays, said North
”continues and expands his de-
termined effort to disrupt an on-
going criminal investigation.”

North, the former National ,
Security Council aide who was
involved in the arms sales to Iran
and efforts to channel money_to
the Nicaraguan Contras, first
challenged the legitimacy of
Walsh's probe on Feb. 24, argu-
ing that the law under which it
was begun, the Ethics in Govern-
ment Act, was unconstitutional.

Last week Attorney General Ed-
win Meese ill, in an effort to
safeguard the investigation,
directed Walsh also to- proceed
under the authority of the attor-
ney general.

However, North filed a second

challenge on Friday, arguing that
Meese’s action also had been un-
constitutional.

The Tower report, released
Feb. 26, portrayed Reagan's Na- '

tually out of control and criticized

A bill passed earlier in
Washington wi|l'make it easier
for illegal aliens to seek political
asylum’ in this country, ruling
they need only show ”a well-
founded fear” they will be per-
secuted ifforced to return home.

The Reagan administration had
argued that applicants for asylum
should have to show ”a clear
probability” of persecution.

It remained unclear, however,
whether the 6-3 ruling will lead
to the granting of asylum for more
illegal aliens because the ultimate

decision remains with the attor-
ney general.

The court ruled in the case of
a Nicaraguan woman living in
Nevada who says the leftist San-
dinistas would persecute her if
she is forced to return to her na-
tive country.

In other actions, the court:

0 Ruled, by a 5-4 vote in a
New Hampshire case that crimi-

_ nal suspects sometimes may be

asked to give_up the right to sue
authorities in return for having

that evidence need not be ex-
cluded from a trial when police
act under a state law subsequent-
ly declared unconstitutional. The
court's 5-4 ruling reinstated evi-
dence seized by Illinois officials
seeking to prosecute the theft of
cars and auto parts in Chicago.

Monday's ruling is a prelimi-
nary victory for Luz Marina
Cardoza—Fonseca, who came to
this country from Nicaragua in
1979 and remained "in the San
Francisco area, overstaying her
visa. She since has moved to
Nevada.

Cardoza—Fonseca, 38, conced-
ed in 1981 that she could be

deported lawfully. But she ap-
plied for asylum on the ground
the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua would retaliate against
her because her brother, a form-
er ally of the Sandinistas,
denounced them and fled to the
United States.

Immigration officials said she
failed to show a clear probabili-
ty she would be persecuted in
Nicaragua.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals overruled the immigra-

tion officials in 1985

If the board now rules in her '
favor, she would be eligible to re-

V THE PITT NEWS

Wednesday, March ll, T987

Evans and crew getting anxious to go west

By John Enright

Sports Editor

coach John
Thompson had his own prefer-
ence for where he wanted to go
in the NCAA tournament before
the seedings were announced
late Sunday afternoon.

”I’m a Western man myself,’.’
said Thompson, laughing.

One can see why, with the
kind of success his Hoyas have
had in the West Regional in re-

P cent years. Two of the three sea-

sons Georgetown went to the
Final Four (1982 and 1984), it
came out of the West Regional.

0

Traditionally, it [the S

tournament] is new life.
We're going out west
and starting over.

— Paul Evans

But this season, Thompson's
team was seeded first in the
Southeast Regional.

The Pitt Panthers received the
honor of going across the coun-
try to a regional that has general-
ly been considered the weakest
of the four.

Pitt (24-7) is seeded third in the

/West and will play the -14th-_
seeded Marist Red Foxes (20-9) in
Tucson, Ariz., on Friday night at
9:07 EST. ‘ .

Panther coach Paul Evans is
pleased about his team's position
in the tournament. ”The kids and
the coaching staff are happy with
the seed and where we are go-
ing,” said Evans. ”Traditionally,
it [the tournament] is new life.
We're going out West and start-
ing over.” .

But Evans doesn't share the
opinion that the Western Region-
al is one filled with less power-
ful teams. ”With the addition of
Iowa [second-seed] and Virginia
[5th] I don't think it's weak,” said
Evans. The other strong teams in

the West include UNLV (Ist), Ok-—

lahoma (6th) and Pitt.
.”The reason I'm pleased is be-
cause we've had success out

West [Pitt won the Rainbow Clas-
sic in Hawaii back in December],
and the kids are frustrated with
the officiating,” said Evans.

Evans has been very adamant
in his criticism of the Big East
officiating in his first year in the
league and especiallyof the treat-
ment of Pitt center Charles Smith.
Smith has fouled out of eight
games this year (four in the Big
East) and has been in foul trouble
in the majority of the Panthers’
games.

”The touch fouls have
bothered him. Charles gets called
for putting his hand on some-
body, and then he gets ham-
mered clown at the other end of
the floor, and there's no call,’’
said Evans. ”He’s been afraid to
dosome things out on the floor

because he's worried about get-l

ting called for fouls. It [the
officiating] has taken away some
of his offensive moves. The last
three, four weeks have gotten
him down.” _

In the tournament, that may not
be a problem for Pitt, which has
played-four gamesout West this
season — three in the Rainbow
Classic and a game at Brigham
Young on Dec. 20. In those
games, Evans liked what he saw
of the officials. ”I thought the
[Western Athletic Conference]
and PAC—1 O officials were good,”
commented Evans.‘

However, i it’ isn't just the
officiating that Evans thinks will
help his team, but rather the fact
that Pitt is playing so far from
home. ”Getting away from the
[Pittsburgh] area will help,” said
Evans, who has constantly wor-
ried about the pressure his team
puts on itself.

But the Panthers have respond-
ed to that pressure with a Big East
co-championship season and a fi-
nal ranking of 12 in The Associat-
ed Press poll.

Although, Pitt has lost three of

its last six games, two of which

J (Georgetown 65-52 on Feb. 18

and.Syracuse, ‘99-85, last Satur-
day) were, for the most part,
blowouts. The Panthers’ other
late-season loss was at St. John's
on Feb. 28, 76-74.

Evans dismisses anythoughts

that his ballclub is slumping,

Some advice for

”I’m walking to New
Orleans,”

— Fats Domino

And UNLV is running. And
N.C. State is sneaking. And Ge-
orgetown is scrambling. And
they, along with 61 other eager
beavers, are all hoping to get
down to Louisiana, too. So, with
apologies to the PR men at Miller
High Life — It's Tourney Time!

Have you taken a serious look

at the picture of parity called the -

NCAA tourney brackets? _Re-
minds me of the All New Any-
thing Goes. With Jimmy
Valvano’s lowly N.C. State trip-
ping lofty North Carolina in the
finals of the ACC tournament, the
Pack appropriately set the theme
for this year's Grand Ball “of
Hoops. No. I-- seeds, .look>-out!

 There-are’ three score teams out“

  

there quite capable of packing
yourbags early.

The East Regional —- Doesn't
the tournament committee love
Dean Smith's Tarheels? Aside
from the Notre Dame giant killers
-— Digger Phelps’ club knocked
off Top—20 Duke, DePaul and
UNC this season -— the ’Heels
have potentially smooth sailing
until the Eastern final. Their op-
ponent? Look for Syracuse, Pur-
due or, if Valvano starts waving
that magic wand he found back
in 1983, the Wolfpack. Carolina

is definitely beatable, but hardly '

in this region. .
The Southeast Regional —
Probably the toughest, most
balanced region in the tourna-
ment. Look for the first round
Kentucky-‘Ohio.-State match-up to

' be a real thriller; Alabama, Illinois »
>;=and.; Clemson, all“ .are excellent: 

 
  

   

Curtis Aiken, shown here inaction against Georgetown, wil

rigors‘ of Big East play.

“Georgetown and St. John's are
two tough places to play, and I
don't know if anybody could

have beaten Syracuse last Satur-
’ day,” said Evans. '

The Panthers are also looking
forward to playing somebody
different afterfacing Big East op-
ponents in 18 of their last 21
games. ”I’m glad to get away
from the Big East and the Big East

amblers, and all that jazz

clubs, but the Illini ‘are
renowned choke-artists, Alaba-
ma’s bench is only skin-deep,
and Clemson is without crucial
tournament experience. They ha-

ven’t been a real contender since

I 980. »

The prime thoroughbreds-here
are the Georgetown Hoyas.
They're deep, well coached, and
they have that crucial tourney ex-
perience under their wastebands.
And, oh yes, some guy’, named
Reggie Williams plays for them,

' too. A

dence and meek Seton Hall both:

said senior guard Curtis Aiken.
Added Smith, ”We want to
play someone different. With the
Big East teams, you know what
everyone is going to do. Take
Syracuse -— we've played them
three times, and we know what

they'll do, and they know what_

we're going to do.”
Against Marist on Friday night,

regular season (Seton Hall did
twice). The Hoyas are certainly
not immune.

The Midwest Regional — Up-
set Special of the First Round:
Wichita State over St. John's.
Coach Eddie Fogler’s Shockers
are a real surprise this year. St.
John's was slumping, then they
were dismantled by Providence
in the Big East tournament.

Overall, Indiana is the class of
this region, although they can be
thankful no other Big Ten teams
lurk .in the Midwest. DePaul is
rolling under Joey Meyer, and the
revitalized Dallas Comegys and
second-seeded Temple look real-
ly fine — at least on paper. These
guys are used to the underdog

everyone gunning for them,-they

thing, Marist knows more about 

nationally recognized Pitt than
the Panthers know about the
ECAC Metro champion Red Fox-

three games on television,” said
Marist coach Dave Magarity.‘ ’’I

Montana State takes Man

AP — Montana State got a brief
taste of New York basketball last
season. Now the Bobcats would
like a chance to take their game
to the Big Apple.

Montana, State, regu lar-season
champions of the Big Sky Confer-
ence, plays host to Washington

Wednesdayﬂnight in one of three -

games that open the 32-team Na-
tional ' Invitation Tournament.

Marquette is at Nebraska and
Utah at Boise State in the other
two opening-night games.

Montana State enters its game
21-7, far better than last season's
'14--16. But last season, it made
the NCAA tournament with a
14-16 record by winning the con-
ference tournament. This year,
the Bobcats were upset by Weber
State 106-101 in the postseason
so they had to settle for the NIT.

”It’s a chance to redeem our-
selves,” said guard Ray Willis. ”If
the season ‘was going to end, we
didn't want it to end on that note,
playing like we did against We-
ber State.”

Last year, the Bobcats played
creditably in the NCAA tourna-
ment —— losing 83-74 as the 16th
seed in the West to top-seeded St.

THE PITI' NEWS, Wednesday, March 11, 1987

John's in Long Beach, Calif. This
year, three wins will put them in
the NIT semifinals on St. Johns’
sometimes-home court, Madison
Square Garden.

”New York, that's the place to
be,” said Willis.

Washington, 18-14, lost in the
PAC-10 final to‘ UCLA and also
had to settle for the NIT. The
Huskies’ offense revolves around
7-0 West German center Christi-
an Welp.

But ‘just the fact that, it's
Washington is enough for the
Bobcats.

”I -always wanted to play
against a PAC-10 team, not
necessarily to compare leagues
but‘just for a chance to go up
against that type of school to see
how strong we are,” said forward

. Calvin Andrews, a native of Rich-

mond, Calif.

”It’s a good opportunity to ex-
tend our season with some good
postseason play,” said guard
Chris Conway. ”It should be
good experience for the'team,

playing a nationally-known op-'

ponent" .
Marquette, 16-12, and Nebras-
ka, 17-11, will be meeting from

two different perspectives.

For Nebraska, where football
overshadows basketbal|,4this is a
chance to get some needed ex-
posure at home. For Marquette,
it's routine business — this is the
Warriors’ fourth straight NIT and
its 21st postseason appearance.

Both coaches Bob Dukiet of
Marquette and Danny Nee of
Nebraska are in their first
seasons. _

”Financially, the NIT [is] not as
much help as the NCAA, but psy-
chologically and prestige—wise,
you can't put it in dollars and
cents,” Nee says.

”You’re in a postseason tourna-
ment, only 96 teams can say that.
When you play at this time of the
year, it just gives you more credi-
bility and recognition,” he said.

I On Thursday night, La Salle, '

16-12, plays Villanova, 15-15, in
Philadelphia; Rhode Island, 20-9,
visits Florida State, 18-10;
Cleveland State, 24-7, travels to

THE PITT NEWS, "Wednesday,

March 11, 1937

 

By Steve Herwald
For The Pitt News

Billy Owens, a redshirt senior,

. has finally found a position on the

Pitt football team that he can call
his own.

At the beginning of last season,
head coach Mike Gottfried
named Owens the starting strong
safety. Owens responded by
leading the Panther secondary
with 106 tackles and tying team-
mate Quintin Jones with a team

., ' high four interceptions. This in-
- cluded

two returned for
touchdowns.
At the end of the season,
Owens, a native of Syracuse,
N.Y., received national recogni-
tion by earning honorable men-
tion All-America and All-East
honors by The Associated Press.
He was also selected to the
Eastern Collegiate Athletic As-

sociation (ECAC) All-Star team.

Owens is not satisfied with his
performance last year. An intense
competitor, he sees room for im-
provement.

”Last season I think I did bet-
ter in other people's eyes than
what I think I did myself,” Owens
said. ‘fl always feel that I can do
better than what I've done. I've
got to be hard on myself. That's
just the way I play the game.”

Owens is currently training on
his own in preparation for the up-
coming spring football practice,
which begins in roughly a month.
He follows a running and weight-
lifting program regularly. Buddy
Morris, Pitt's weightlifting coach,
cannot say enough good things
about Owens.

”Bi|ly always gives 110 per-
cent. He's constantly looking for
something extra to do,” Morris
said. ’’He’s very goal-oriented,

and, most importantly, his
greatest attribute is that he'll
never quit on you.”

There have been plenty of
times during his football career at
Pitt when Owens could have quit
out of frustration. During his
freshman year, he injured his
knee, which later required
surgery. V '

After undergoing a long re-
habilitation process, he returned
to. the team only to discover that
he had become a player without
a position. He was shuffled back
and forth between tailback and
the secondary. Owens didn't
quit. He just worked harder.

Owens has set lofty goals for

”I want to earn first-team All-

viewed football as a way to fur-

Woodley wants to come back, but
Noll may just have other ideas  

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Pitts-
burgh Steelers coach'Chuck Noll
isn't exactly rolling out a wel-
come mat, but he is opening
what was a firmly locked door to
”retired” quarterback David
Woodley, who has been itching
to return to Pittsburgh.

”If David Woodley wants to
play and wants to play badly, we
won't turn him away,” Noll said
at a news conference Monday.

But Woodley said he's a little

confused by Noll’s comments.

”He says things like that, and
you can take it 10 different
ways,” Woodley said. ”I really
think if he wanted me to come to.
minicamp, he'd tell me because
he knows I'd go. I just don't think
that's in his scheme right now.”

Noll didn't try to dissuade
Woodley from retiring when the
quarterback announced his inten-
tions to do so last May. —

But Woodley has changed his

mind since then. He said he's
talked to several Steelers execu-
tives about returning, including
team President Dan Rooney and
Offensive Coordinator Tom
Moore, since October.

”They didn't come out and say
they weren't interested. But they
said, ’We’re set with the people
we have. If anything happens,
we'll keep you in mind,_’ ”
Woodley said.

Men gymnasts plagued by injuries

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’_s gymnastics
team, still haunted by individual
injuries, traveled to Kent State for
the Great Lakes Championships
this past weekend. The Panthers
(9-4) placed third out of five, scor-

ing a season high of 259.35.

I ’’I’m pleased with the job we
did,” said head’ coach Frank

D’Amico. ”The team competed , _

well and showed good spirit. I
thought we were the best‘ team

there.” . T
The Western Michigan team
finished first with a score of
264.7, while Kent State was sec-
ond scoring 262.5. Eastern Michi-
gan and Miami of Ohio finished
fourth and fifth, respectively.
The top 10 individual perform-
ers of the ‘meet competed after
the preliminary. rounds in the fi-

nals, and the Pitt team supplied '

three of these individuals. Jorge
Gonzalez placed third with a
score of 52.75’, Jorge Sanchez
was fourth scoring 52.7, and Pat

Pollaci was sixth scoring a per-
sonal best of 51.7.

Several Panthers placed in in-
dividual events in finals. Among
them, Sanchez placed second on
the floor scoring a 9.7, and Steve

Powanda tied for sixth on the .

floor with a 9.15. Dan Tarosky.

he said from his home in Davie,
Fla. ’’I don't know what else I can
do. ltold them 10 different times
I want to come back, and I'm just
waiting for them to let me know
one way or another.”

Noll has not talked to Wood-
ley_since last May and would not
elaborate on what he meant. But
he said the Steelers would have
to let Woodley report if he want-
ed to. Once he shows up and
rosters are paired, the Steelers
must either keep'him, cut him or
trade him.

”To be quite honest with you,
I don't think the Steelers have any
interest in me at all,” Woodley
said. ’’I think what he meant by
that statement was that if David

A wants to play football badly-
enough, then we'll try to ‘find him _

 

   

 

a place to play.”
Noll said the team has talked to
other National Football League

teams about a possible trade for.

Woodley’s rights. He said he
didn't know if the Steelers got any
nibbles in their trade talks, ”but
our‘bobber’s still floating/.’

If Woodley did play this year
under his old contract, he would
be paid $550,000, the highest

base salary on the team. Starting"

quarterback Mark Malone will

earn $475,00 this season, _not
counting incentives. ' _
Malone and Woodley compet-
ed for the No. 1 job for two years.
Because of injuriesthey virtually
shared the role, but heading into

1986, Noll proclaimed Malone»
his starter, and Woodley then -

”retired.”

Malone and Bubby Brister, last
year's third—round draft choice,
are the only quarterbacks on the
roster.

. By Sam Tallarico

Sta ff Writer

Something happened this past
Saturday that hasn't happened
much this season — Lee McRae
lost a race.

Not just any race but, the
World Indoor Championships in

‘the Indianapolis Hoosier Dome.

Canadian Ben Johnson broke his
record in the
60-meter dash -with a -time of
6.14. McRae was second at 6.50,
but it was more than just a
second-place finish.

And it really wasn't a loss,
either.

McRae broke the all-time
American record in the 60-meter
hurdles set by Houston McTear in
1978. McRae is also now the
owner of the fastest time in the

 " 55-meter dash in the world.

But McRae was not the only
one competing last weekend. Six-
teen other Pitt track team mem-
bers ran at the IC4A

for the most part, they fared well.

In the 800—meter dash, sopho-
more Dave Moore broke the Pitt
indoor school record with a time
of 1249.3. He placed second in
the event. -

”Dave’s time is one of the
fastest in the country,” boasted
Pitt men's track coach John Vas-
vary. ”He now has the fourth

fastest [time] in the country. Tim ,

Manes finished fourth with a time
of 1:49.78, which also broke the
old school record.”

In the 55-meter hurdles, the

‘Panthers captured both second

and fifth“ place. George Ifill was
second at 7.37, and Calvin Hol-
mes was fifth at 7.42.

The distance medley, com-
posed ofJoe Daniels, Chip Bur-
ton, Tom Boggan and Bob

time of 9:47.96. Weiner, who ran

”A runner from another school

ground,” Vasvary said. ”We
could have been second.”

The mile relay broke the school
record in the semifinals to ad-
vance to the finals. Price ran the
anchor in the semi-final in 46.4,
the fastest 400—meter time in
school history. However, since
the time was made by in a relay,
it is not recorded as the fastest

tinue for another week when they
compete in the NCAA Champi-
onships in Oklahoma City this
weekend.

McRae, a junior who last year
set the indoor world record in the

55 meters here, will try to defend '

his title.

”Lee's a favorite to win, but he
can't afford to make a mistake,”
Vasvary said. .

Eric Cannon will compete. in
the 55—meter'hurd|es, and Wein-
er, Daniels, Manes. and Moore
will take part in the tvvo-mile re-
lay. These six are the same ath-
letes who all came away with
All-America indoor honors last
yean

Commenting on Cannon, Vas-

vary said,-“In the hurdles, a split’

second can divide 18 people, so
I think he's capable.”

The two-mile relay team,-

despite having the fastest time in
the nation this year, is not consi-

dered the favorite in that particu-
lar race because of Oklahoma
City's ”s|ow track." Vasvary,
however, doesn't think it will af-
fect the relay team's per-
formance. _ ‘

”Time-wise going in, we are
not considered one of the
favorites — but time doesn't
mean a thing when you line up
at the start,” Vasvary added.

When trying to figure outhow , ‘_

well the team will perform, Vas-

vary is a bit hesitant because of F

the strong competition.
.”I don't know how well we'll

do because you don't know how A

the others will do. Lee_’s a better

sprinter, Eric's a better hurdler, '

and the two-mile relay is faster.

On his performance on -the
rings, Tarosky said, ”I was for-

One encouraging point for the ‘

Panthers was that they set a new
team record on the pommel
horse scoring an impressive 43.6.

Tarosky said. ”We keep getting

headline in one New York‘ tab-

shrieked another over a picture of
Fernandez on Tuesday;

The reaction.

"’We’ll schedule an intra-squad
game so half the squad knows
what‘it’s like to win one,” said
Manager Davey Johnson.

”You don’texpect something
like this to happen, but you're not
surprised when it does,” said

' pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre.

”The early part of spring training
doesn't really mean anything be-
cause the pitchers aren't working
yet on all their pitches.-All I can
say is that they ain't ready yet.”

The victims also appeared un-
concerned.

 

 

 THE PITINEWS, Wednesday, March II, 1987

I don't think it's a concern,” said
Fernandez,f who,:_was- 16-6 last
season and was one of the heroes
of the World Serieswith two 2‘-3
hitless innings that kept the Mets.
in the seventh game that they
eventually won.

”I don't like to give up all these
runs, but it doesn't mean I'm giv-
ing up. I can turn it around,” said
Fernandez. _

Fernandez’s performance came
with heavy winds blowing out,
and seven of the runs he allowed
were unearned -— courtesy of a
throwing error by rookie third
baseman Dave Magadan.

_Gooden, who also has to con-
tend with the publicity from his
offseason run-in with the police
in his hometown of Tampa,
didn't have those excuses and his
performance was more mys-
tifying.

”It got behind on hitters, and

since I'm a power pitcher, they
knew what was, coming,” said
Gooden, who didn't throw a
curve during his outing. ’’I can't
let it_bother me. But after a while,
I just hoped they'd hit it hard at
someone to get the inning over.”

Gooden and Fernandez will
get more chances this spring,
which is about the way the Mets
are taking things.

”My "only concern is if it hap-

pens at the end of March,” sec-

ond baseman Wally Backmang

said after the Fernandez shelling.
