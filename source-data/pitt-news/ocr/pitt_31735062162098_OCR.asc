Time Schedule Fee Cancelled Rcbm and Board Prices

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Controversy over the 25 cent
time schedule fee is expected to
end today with the institution of a
free distribution system, according
to Vice-chancellor of Operations,
Joseph A. Dutton.

“Everyone who needs a time
schedule to register for the fall
term will get one free,” Dutton
said, without releasing any other
speciﬁc points of the new proposal.

Plans to charge students for
schedules were arranged by Dutton
in an effort to reduce printing costs
and waste. However the idea met
sharp student criticism after the
ofﬁcial announcement January 31.

Student Government [SG] Pres-
ident Mike Furick and other
student leaders then worked
together with the administration to
discover alternative solutions to the
problems.

“I’ve achieved all of my ends,”
Dutton explained, .”“in terms of

reducing the fundamental printing _

costs of time schedules.”

Dutton explained three years ago
the time schedules were printed
attractively in a normal type--
setting process. -

The University then changed to a
computer photo-offset which re-
duced costs by approximately 50% .

Using the photo-offset on a
newsprint type paper, as in the
newly-printed spring/ summer time‘
schedules, reduced the costs
another 50%.

Time schedules under the new
printing process cost approx-
imately 15 cents per copy, Dutton
said, adding three years ago the

. price was not as inexpensive.

Dutton said approximately 10--
15,000 time schedules were printed
for the spring/summer sessions
and at 15 cents per copy, the

On trial basis

, University is spending $1500-2500.

This is approximately 40-50%
savings over the costs of winter
time schedule printing.

’Computer_off—set printing also
reduces the turnaround period-—the
time between when class schedules
are submitted by deans and the
time the actual schedule is
available for the student’s use,"
Dutton said. I

He added, “If it is possible I
would like to send this draft (of the
new proposal) over to Mike Furick
and then down to the Chancellor”
before it is released to the press.

Hiked for Fall Term '74 B

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Room and board prices will be
hiked for students living in the
dormitories beginning September
1974.

The new fee stipulates $700 per
term for a double room and full
board, and $750 per term for single
room and full board. Cost to
students with optional meal con-
tracts will vary. .

Hillman Extends Library Hours to lam

Hillman Library will expand its
evening hours to 1 am, Sunday
through Thursday, beginning to-
day, according to Glenora Rossell,
director of University libraries, and
Jeff Chaby and Bill Haslett of the

Police Call Box Hotlines

Installed Across Campus

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
A university-wide emergency
police communication system, re-
lying on a network of telephone call

. boxes, may be operative within 30

days. according to" Joseph Gil,
director of Health, Safety and
Parking.

Gil designed the system, later
modiﬁed by a student advisory
committee, resembling the security
system he instituted as security
ofﬁcer at Carlow College.

“The system is not operational
yet,” said Gil. “None of the
boxes have phones in them yet.”

According to Gil’s system, as
drafted by University engineers,
the boxes will offer any victim or
witness to a crime instant
communication with Varsity Hall,
the campus police headquarters.
“They don't have to dial any
numbers," said Gil. “As soon as
the receiver is lifted they get an
ofﬁcer on the other end."

One of the benefits of the
system, according to both Gil and a
University engineer, is every

A student on campus will have a way

of alerting campus police about
crimes, and receive immediate
response. -

“We will be able to get» an ofﬁcer

to any scene in, at the most, two
minutes," said Gil. “Just
knocking the phone off the hook
will bring a response."

The system, according to plans
on Gil's desk, will include about 45
installations some in buildings and
some outside, and others along the
most heavily traveled pedestrian
routes. I

Gil admitted vandalism will
create problems at first, but
damage to installations will regis-
ter at Varsity Hall, and the
feedback will permit quick repair of
damaged phones.

“We realize that there will be
problems, and that there will be
expenses." said Gil. “But that’s
the price" we’ll pay." He also
pointed out the installations are
subject to continuous inspection by
beat ofﬁcers, and students caught
vandalizing the call boxes would be
brought before the Student Judicial
Board.

The cost of the University system
installation by Pennsylvania Bell is
being borne by the University. The
ﬁnal cost of the entire operation is
not yet known exactly.

The Carlow College system,
consisting of seven phones and a
switch-board, cost about $3000, Gil
said. .

Resident Association
(RSA).

This trial period will last until the
end of the current trimester, at
which time a decision for future
hours will be formulated.

According to Haslett, there will
be somewhat limited s‘ervices
available. “The only staff in the
library will be one person at each of
the two lending desks, one person
in the documents "area, one
supervisor and a campus policeman
from 3:30 pm to 1 am.

“There may be some problems

Student

' charging books out after midnight

as the computer for processing
books shuts down for maintenance
at this time. The Library is also
cleaned at this time, but the staff
has been instructed to work around

the students," Haslett said.

The proposal also included a
second clause that the Library
remain open 24 hours during exam
period, however no ﬁnal decision
has been made in that,1'egard.

A release from the RSA quoted
Chancellor Posvar as saying, “It is
my understanding that this pro-
posal [extending library hours] was
developed through cooperation
with you andyour associates [Dr.
Allen Kent and Chaby and Haslett].
and that it is feasible to implement

immediately for purposes of‘

evaluating its utility and desira-

bility of a permanent change.”
Haslett said the additional hours

would cost the Library $13-1500.

(Continued on Page 3)

Joseph A Dutton said the approxi- '

mate 7% increase was due to
recent rise in the costs of operation
and food service for the affected
3500 dorm residents.

“Please recognize,” Dutton"

said, “that the bulk of the total H

raise was due to food service
increases."
Dutton explained the bulk of the

dormitory increase was due to the

increase in the cost of maintenance
and utilities to the University.
“Essentially we’re just hanging

on with this price hike,” Dutton.

said. “One thing you have to
recognize is that the dormitories

are a business within a business. It _,

would be unfair if we tapped the
tuitions of the University to support

the dorms. Only those who live in _

the dorms will pay the cost.
According to Dutton,
suggestions that the recent "main-
tenance worker’s strike and resul-
ting increase led to the raise were
not well-founded, andrather the
cost of food itself was the major
reason for the board increase.

When told some students felt the ,

price hike was not legitimate,
Dutton said the University was not
responsible for the necessary

increase, insisting the alternative‘

to increase was lower quality.
“Its beyond my control, or
student control. I don’t mean to be
facetious, but if a student doesn’t
like it, they can elect to not live in
the dormitories. We encourage

Profs Outline Impeachment

Dr. Richard Seeburger

   

BY VIRGINIA COOK

Constitutional law professors
Richard Seeburger and Anthony
Wettick informally discussed
“Watergate, Impeachment and the
Constitution" at a student seminar
Friday and concluded that im-

peachment of President Nixon by.

the House and conviction by the
Senate are improbable.

“The Democrats are saying ‘If
we keep him (President Nixon) in
I'll be re-elected,” Wettick re-
marked while noting the political
posture of the Congress as it faces
November's election. '

In response to a student’s
question‘ of what constitutes an
impeachable offense, Seeburger
said the impeachment power of
Congress is not limited to
indictable offenses, but rather
stretches over a broad ‘spectrum
from indictable offenses to dis-
agreement with administration

 

policy. A ’
“Impeachment in England was a
hanging offense,” Seeburger noted

in sketching the attitudes oflthe

draftor’s of the constitution. He

said the founding fathers entrusted _

the ultimate impeachment
power--jury sitting to convict or
acquit--to the Senate, because they
believed it would be above political
pressures. The Supreme Court
failed to receive the power because

the drafters felt the justices too .

small a group to delegate such
enormous power. .
Running through a list of’ things
the House Judiciary Committee
might consider significant enough
to investigate as possible impeach-
able offenses, Wettick mentioned
knowledge of the Ellsberg breakin,
secret bombing of Cambodia, the
ITT and milk affairs, associating

..with criminals, tax evasion, bribery

Bob Heister. former Student
Government Board (SGB) member,
was elected Commuter Association
(CA) president in its election
Thursday and Friday.

Others elected were Peggy
Chomas, vice-president; Bob
Croker, treasurer; and Joan Lacki,
secretary.

Heister received 76% of the vote
against Social ‘Chairman Daniel
Tush. About 21% of eligible CA
members cast ballots, according to
Al Watterson, editor of The Magic
Bus, the commuter newspaper.

“I'm going to try to do the best
job I can." said Heister, who last

for the competition is midnight,
May 31, 1974.

The competition is being spon-
sored by FICU, a nonprofit,

The Truth About Waterbeds

Waterbeds represent an exciting and serious improvement over the old fash-
ioned boxsprinig mattress. Doctors have recognized the therapeutic and by-
gienic values of the waterbed for many years. When sleeping on a waterbed
your back, shoulders and hips receive total floatation support. ‘Body weight is
distributed more evenly than is possible

on any conventional bed, making a
waterbed the most comfortable and
'healthful sleeping surface available.
A waterbed’s gentle. heat helps relax
tense muscles while the firm floating
support lulls you into a deep, restful

' i sleep.

month lost his bid for re-election to

Heister feels the gas station
shutdown should be of major
concern to the CA. “I want to
make sure the administration
makes every allowance possible at
midterm time. I don’t think
students should be held respon-
sible for exams they arrive late for
because of packed buses.”

The CA may be over-extending
itself, Heister feels. “We have to
look at so_me areas and see which
are necessary. We haven‘t got a
million people, so we’ll have to cut
down," he said. I

“The University has made some
significant steps, but I think there

is even more to be done...TheA

Commons Room lighting program
seems to be coming along well."
Heister also said he will push for
cheaper overnight rooms and
better security at parking lots.
Outgoing President Margie
Masilunas said, “I'm very glad
that Bob won because he's familiar
with the workings of_ CA and
represented us on several com-
mittees in the Student Govern-
ment. Now he has the opportunity
to follow up on his work there.”
' Masilunas feels this has been the
CA's best year. “The emphasis
has been on making people aware

of us. Bob will be more
issue-oriented. ’ '
The major commuter accom-

plishments this year, Masilunas
said, were: taking an active stand
on parking, establishment of the
Commuter Bandits, increased
activity by the Social Committee,
and cooperation with Port
Authority Transit over bus stop
shelters and the U-bus.

Hillmcin Extends Library Hours Io lcrm

(Continued from Page 1)

The Library would come up foi
budget modiﬁcation if the current
budget cannot handle the addi-
tional expense, he added.

Both Rossell and Haslett said the
expanded hours would be success-
ful if 100 people‘ were using the
Library at 1 am.’

“We are very supportive of this

versity libraries, photo by Redic.

students to shop around.”

Student Government President,
Mike Furick, said he was aware
many students didn’t feel com-
fortable with the increase, and he
would make their unrest known to
Dutton.

“I told Joe," Furick said, “that
he was raising prices and cutting
back on services, and that people
were going to be unhappy about it.
I don't know what we can do about
it--it's a dollars and cents thing."

Furick mentioned the maid

services in the dorms would be cut
back to service once a month
instead of every other week, and he
wanted some assurance alternative
services would beoffered to the
students.
‘ Dutton said‘ he could see no
reason why the student body
should not be provided with
equipment such as sweepers, to
clean their room. “It would be
alright if we could make sure that
we got it back," said Dutton.

According to Dutton, members
of his staff consulted with the
Resident’.s Students Association
and the Student Food Committee in

move." Rossell said, “And we’d
like to make this run. It's a way for
students in the noisy dorms to use
the Library and there seems to be a
need for students to have extra
time in Hillman Library," Rossell
said.

“With the expanded hours, a lot
of General Studies,resident, and off
campus students will be able to use
the Library but there probably
won’t be a lot of benefit for the
commuters. I urge the student
body to make full use of these
newly acquired facilities,” Haslett
said.

Although no official survey was
taken by the RSA, or Hillman
Library, only the_ University of
Minnesota Library is known to be
open 24 hours. ’  ~

Other universities across the
state, the University of Pennsyl-
vania’s Van Pelt Library, Penn
State’s Pattee Library and Lehigh
University's Linderman Library are
open T until midnight; and Du-
quesne’s University Library, and
Temple University's Samuel Paley

the course of analyzing cost
problems involved with operation
of the dorms.

Dutton said none of the increases
were meant to add to the proﬁts of
the University, and the present
increases were aimed at main-
taining a reasonable quality of
service at a reasonable price.
“We're trying to get the most
boom for the buck," he said.

Library are open until 11 pm.
Carnegie-Mellon University’s Hunt

Tax Form Adds

Election Fund Line

One of the changes on this year’s
federal income tax return Fomis
1040 and 1040A is the inclusion of
the Presidential Election Campaign
Fund question.

Contributing to the Eimd is still
strictly optional. If a taxpayer does
not check line 8, no part of his taxes
will be set aside for the fimd.
However, if a taxpayer has a tax

liability of $1 or more, and so"

designates, $1 of his taxes will be
channelled into the non partisan
fund. Taxpayers ﬁling jointly nny
‘each designate $1.

In addition, if a taxpayer did not
designate $1 of his 1972 taxes to
the fund and now wishes to do so,
he may check off the line just above
his signature on this year's" form.

Checking off $1 to the Fund does
not affect the amount of a
taxpayer’s liability nor his refund.

The money designated by
taxpayers for the non partisan
presidential election campaign
fund will be turned over to the
General Accounting Office which
determines the allocation of the
money.

‘ conclusion

  

Dear Thomas, .
There is an old saying which
goes, “Those that only criticize are
good for little else.” ‘After reading
your ﬁrst few columns I ﬁnd this bit

of wisdom ﬁtting you to a tee.
You have criticized the past

’ SGB for its handling of the 25 cent
- , time schedule charge and the $5

add-drop fee, yet you never
attended one meeting that we had

-with the administration nor even

showed your face in the SG office
while these problems were being
"discussed. You insist that the past

5Board was a closed shop, yet

information was available to

anyone who had enough interest to

ask:
You have personally attacked Joe

.- Dutton when I know that you

haven’t met the man more than

‘ twice. How you can conclude that

he is either evil or foolish, when
your actual knowledge of Dutton 5
past actions wouldn’t ﬁll the head
of a pin, is beyond me.

Letters

I Post-Gazette

To the Editor:
As ofﬁcers on the University of
Pittsburgh police force, we were

: justifiably angry to see the

Post-Gazette’s story on February
20, (“Pitt’s Police Rapped In Study
Unit’s Report”), because we feel it
represents a major distortion of the
report in question and totally
misrepresents current conditions in
our organization.

No reasonable person reading
the report of the specially
appointed committee which in-
vestigated a recent dormitory
incident could come to the
that the report
“rapped” the police or was
“sharply critical of them,” as the
story states.

The report was primarily de-
scriptive of the events in question
and, if anything, pointed out that
the 'University’s student affairs
staff should have prevented the
incident from becoming a police
matter in the ﬁrst place. In this, we
totally concur.

While it is true ‘that one
patrolman involved in the incident
was subsequently ﬁred from the
force, his dismissal was unrelated
to the incident under study.

With the exception of one case
still pending, the students placed
under arrest that evening all were
found guilty as charged in City
Court.

The reporter who wrote the story
dredged from his ﬁles a series of
other recent publicized events
concerning the campus police force
which also were unrelated to the
incident under study, giving the
impression that the Pitt police

' organization is in disarray. In our

opinion, this is a case of mixing
apples and oranges, leading to a
totally false impression of the Pitt
police. Our organization has grown
rapidly in recent years; we now
have the second largest police
organization in the county.

The other recent changes in the
force and proposed studies men-
toned in the Post-Gazette story

You have insulted Gene

where he has pleaded to let his
technology mold his systems to
student needs, rather than vice-

You have mocked Franl-r Reed,
yet forget to mention that
registration lines are shorter and
quicker than many other large
schools and that the system is
being revamped to allow for longer
periods of advising and the
re-opening of previously closed
sections within 24 hours.

You have tossed aside Rege
Kaufman’s proposal for a SG
executive branch yet you don’t
even understand its most funda-
mental concepts. By mirroring the

academic and operational) it could

person might misread this to mean
that the ofﬁcers were “pushing and

Believe us, nothing could be sillier.

We hope that, in the future, the _

Post-Gazette will try to deal more
knowledgeably with the campus

disorganized as the Post-Gazette

To The Editor:

I usually am not the one for.

expressing my opinions out loud,
let alone in print...yet, now I feel
compelled to acknowledge my
disapproval of the recent
“campaign” the groups concerned
with unborn life have been
conducting.

I disapprove of photographs of

severed fetuses being tacked on .

walls, lockers and bulletin boards
on the campus, (which have since
been removed). Furthermore,
attempts to solicite membership
into the organizations with coupons
in the Pitt News, supplemented by
these photos on these coupons
leaves me slightly sickened. I
realize “horror” and “atrocity”
pictures used properly are success-
ful shock devices, capable of
producing great results in people
and their attitudes. Yet, don’t
people have the right to think about
the matter of abortions when given
facts as opposed to these horrifying
pictures.

[do not think it is anyone’s place
to circulate such “private” nmtters
through such methods. Are there
not other ways of inﬂuencing
attitudes?

I realize there may be those
ready to jump down my throat, that
see me as “hiding” from the facts,
trying to “shelter” myself from the
realities. Yet, let me add, that
because many women butcher
themselves unmercifully and
photos exist to document this...

 

Board could formulate its own
plans and proposals for the
University. It would have provided
an unlimited supply of worthwhile
jobs for students with a desire to
get involved as well as providing a
breeding ground for experienced

future Board members.
Yes, Thomas, your problem is
obvious, you can only criticize.

Unlike the people you attack, you
don’t have the guts to come up with
your own solutions to problems, to
let them stand up against the
criticism of your peers. You seem
to be satisﬁed with tearing down
the work of others. Can you really

do any better?

Thomas, by now my message
should be clear, why don’t you do
us all a favor and just put up or shut

up

I hope you can overcome your
urge for a rebuttal and start on mre
productive things.

Should pro-abortionists employ
your tactics?

To change people’s attitudes...
one must respect those individuals
one is trying to influence. To
represent the rights of the fetus,
one must first respect the

Elliott [Pints {Questionnaires

BY GEORGE ZRUST

Few things in this world engross
me as much as the junk mail I
receive.

For example, last year around
this time I ﬁlled one of my columns
with some rather pertinent ob-
servations about literature I had

. received from- a school that trains
young folk to play supporting roles
in the airline industry. '

Well, now I have another piece of
mail to tell you about.

Some months back a non-
descript legal size envelope bear-
ing a Parkway return address slid
through my mail slot.

Nothing too unusual, really--the
printed return address carried no
name of a person or ﬁrm, but my
handwritten address and the
Eisenhower stamp seemed to

, indicate that a small business was

pro/ anti abortion, as my opinions I
will keep as my own...but please...
consider what you doing and why
more carefully with every poster
you hand or coupon you print."
Perhaps you may be hurting your
own argument of humanity. If
these fetuses are life. . .then respect
them as such.

at work. What could be more
harmless?

As it turned out, nothing short of
a quick romp through a den of
underfed grizzlies.

The hot pink (I know not the
signiﬁcance of this color) letter-
head told me that a dating service
wanted me.

My bubble had been burst.

Here I am, thinking myself to be
sitting on top of the social world,
when along comes something like
this that sends me reeling into the

- doldrum belt.

It was obvious that I had to
uncover the perpetrator of this
affront. For a moment, it seemed
the answer to my quest was
contained in the lead paragraph of
the form letter.

“If you did not request this
information it is entirely possible
that your name was supplied ‘by
one of our pleased members.”'

I knew for certain that I did not
request this information. Would
Howard Hughes request welfare
payments? It was now a matter of
discovering wlﬁof my associates,
previously disappointed with love,
had turned suddenly joyous with
affection.

Nothing. Basically I feell had no
evidence with which to begin my
search. Even Holmes, Sherlock,
could not sleuth without clues.

And that is unfortunate. I would
still like to pin the rap_ on the
person who exposed me to the fact
that this dating service “is
designed to bring together the
‘right’ woman with the ‘right’ man
on a regular referral basis, at

frequent intervals.”

Or that, in order to ﬁnd such a
“right” mate, I should have to
resort to so commercial a service
that it is “advertised regularly on
television.” Harumph.

I had my chance to fill out the hot
pink questionnaire (that color
again), but I blew it. Who am I to
rate my feelings on sex, religion,‘
and divorcees on a scale of one to
ﬁve?

With my luck, I’d be paired with

an atheistic ex-lady wrestler who

likes to collect old American
LaFrance ﬁretrucks. A guy would
have to be mighty lonely.

To be sure, the dating service so
far has done me more of a
disservice than anything else.

NEW YORK AP--Time magazine
says one White House document
allegedly altered before it reached
special ‘prosecutor Leon Jaworski
had already been explored in its
entirety before the Senate Water-
gate Committee.

An allegation that some docu-
ments obtained by Jaworski. had

portions cut out, as if by scissors, 4

was reported last week. But the

content of the allegedly altered

documents was not disclosed.
Time said one was a memo to

former White House aide.John D. -

Ehrlichman from Egil Krogh and

David Young of the White House

plumbers investigating unit. .’ The
magazine said it contained sugges-
tions on how to get information on
Daniel Ellsberg, then a Pentagon
papers defendant. : _ ,'

Time said a paragraph recom- ,_
mending “a covert operation...t'o .

examine all the medical ﬁles still
held by Ellsberg’s psychoanalyst,”
and a penciled note by Ehrlichman
approving the covert action “if
done under your assurance that it is
not traceable,” were snipped out of
the copy Jaworski received.

“The ineffective nature of such
alteration of evidence,” Time said,
“was demonstrated by the fact that
a copy of the memo containing the
missing sentences
subpoenaed from Ehrlichman .”

“I am a person, I was violated,

For Pat
Farley, a social worker here in
Pittsburgh, that line from A Case of
Rape, Wednesday’ night’s tele-
vision movie, best characterizes the

‘I , dilemma of a woman who chooses
, to—prosecute her rapist.

Along with Farley, Police
Superintendent Robert Colville,
Assistant District Attorney Bruce

- Dice, defense attorney Ed_ Snyder,

Ellen Soupcoff of Magee Women’s
Hospital and Elyse Rogerson,

administrative assistant to Repre-

sentative John Heinz III, discussed

_  all aspects of rape before a crowd of

90 women and 20 men.
Farley cited three phases of

The first phase in the patterns of
response is the shock. disbelief,
shame and dismay that women will
experience shortly after being
raped. “This will run the gamut
from hysterical outburst to outward
calm.” said Farley. Practical

matters, such as legal and,medical.

care and treatment will begin to
concern the woman later.

Farley said, “That initial stage is
when intervention of a social
worker or counselor can be most
effective. It is important that she
won’t retreat‘ from he1;feelings.

Medical people and police must"

emphasize facts, not feelings.”

In the second phase, the woman

returns to normal routines of living.
“Feelings about the rape are not

resolved--they are denied or

repressed,” said Farley.

Feelings of guilt, shame and
anger return in the third phase of
response. It is at this point that the
families of the victim should be

‘rape’ victim brought

offered counseling.

“Questions of her complicity in
the rape are compounded by the
legal system which forces the
woman to consider herself guilty.”

Ellen Soupcoff spoke of the
emergency room procedure that a
rape victim must go through. In
the last six months, Magee’s
emergency room averaged 10 cases
per month. Ninety-ﬁve percent of
these were brought, in by the
police. “I'd like to believe that a
to any
emergency room would experience
an umbrella of security,” said
Soupcoff.

When a patient arrives at the
emergency room, most attention
will be given to her medical needs.
If the police are involved, the rape
victim will be informed that she will
be questioned by detectives. Then,
she will be given examinations for
trauma-and venereal disease.

Dice, who played the bespeckled
witness in A Case of Rape, said “I
deal with young ladies. They're
upset and they have a story to tell.
Our office just doesn't have the
staff to speak to women weeks or
months before the trial.

“It’s my policy to be somewhat
sympathetic, but we do have to get
to legal issues.”

Ed Snyder, defense lawyer, cited
two distinct kinds of rape, classical
rape and borderline rape.
Borderline rape, according to
Snyder,.is when a woman is not
beaten and does not report the rape
immediately. *

“When I represent the alleged
rapist," said Snyder, “I’m trying
to put that girl on trial.” In
explaining borderline rape, Snyder
termed it a “non-violent crime.”

“In the case of the violent, or
classical rape, where the’ girl is
beaten, ravaged, hospitalized and
immediately calls the police, I
could feel for her.”

Elyse Rogerson" spoke of the
legislative aspects of rape. “There
is a dire necessity to change our

laws, change our attitudes and.

change a system that is so unfair.
We're getting more and more
impetus for change."

Rogerson spoke of a bill before
the House which calls for a national
center for the control and preven-
tion of rape. This center would be
established within the INationa1
Institute of Mental Health, and
would include provisions for a
continuing investigation of the
social conditions which encourage
sexual assault, the impact of the
offense of the victim and sexual
assaults in correctional institutions.

Rogerson commented that since
A Case of Rape was shown on
television, the number of co-
signers for the bill has jumped
to fifty.

Rogerson brought up a question
that all women ask: Should women
attempt ‘to defend themselves
against rapists? “There is no
answer," said assistant DA Dice.
“Don’t struggle. It’s not worth it.
You’re gonna make my job harder",
but don’t struggle.”

An overcoated woman rose and
questioned defense attorney
Snyder. “We offer the rapist so
much protection.
would it violate thelaw to make the
woman’s past history inadmissable
evidence?”

“The difference is,” I said
Snyder, “that the man can go to jail

TS Eliot becomes a conservative
religionist. Ezra Pound invokes
poetic images of Jeffersonian
America, broadcasts for Mussolini,
and is later locked in a cage by
invading American armies.

Allen Tate becomes a‘ southern
conservative and established his
reputation with a poem titled “Ode
to the Confederate Dead.”
William Faulkner ﬁnds his roots in
Mississippi. Yukio Mishima,
Japan’s brightest young literary
light. disembowels himself with a
samarai sword, after which a friend

slices off his head--all as a symbolic -

act on behalf of a Japanese
nationalist group. Robinson
Jeffers and Robert Frost write
American poetry. Dostoevsky

becomes a devout Christian and.

Russian nationalist. From Ire-
land--which -VV1lmot Robertson in
his book The Dispossessed Major-
ity calls “the most nationalistic,
most tribal, most religious and

most racially-rninded of all pres- ,9

ent-day English-speaking” coun-
tries, comes Moore, Wﬂde, Yeats,
Synge, Shaw, Joyce, O’Casey,
Elizabeth Bowen, Paul Vincent
Carroll, Joyce Carey and James
Stephens. And Germany produces
Stefan George.

It is one of the enigmas of our
time that the champions of
cosmopolitan advant garde, who
are otherwise proliﬁc .enough to
turn out a new aesthetic every few
years, must look upon the evidence
of the foregoing passage as a
paradox. The irony is that while
each successive artistic “move-
ment" marches itself into the pit of
hack-neyed kitsch, the artists with
roots in their cultural tradition
remain vital and alive.

Poetry, the. most intensely‘

crafted and sharply urgent type of
literature, is usually also the most
sharply deﬁned in terms of cultural
boundaries, since the poet uses the
language and symbols of .a
particular group--his own--in the
creation of his art, and justiﬁes his
group to the extent that his is an
able poet. Such a poet was the
German, Stefan George who, while
relatively unknown in this country,
is generally recognized as the
greatest.German poet since Goethe
and Holderlin. Only Rilke seriously
rivals his reputation as the most
impoitant German poet of this
century.

Criticism of George in English is
not very extensive, and it is
indicative of the neglect in which
he has been held in this country
that the present volume is the only
English translation of his poetry
currently available. This paper-

-back version, in fact, is merely a

reprint of a hard-bound volume
issued over thirty years ago.
George was born in 1868 to a
prosperous family of" wine mer-
chants in the Rhine valley. From

childhood he was concerned with ‘

the problem of language and what

could be done with it--so much, in 

fact, that he invented a language of
his own, fragments of which
survive in several of his poems. In
his excellent introduction to this
volume,
.Morwitz -asserts-that “even in early

George’s friend Ernst"

youth, the poet felt that the
heritage of antiquity, the joy of
things of this earth, had never
entirely vanished from his native
land, and he sings this joy, not in
words but in sounds that convey
only the emotional quality.”

George travelled extensively
throughout Europe, and for a time
became closely associated with the
French Symbolists. But eventually

he recognized his special affinity

for Germany. It is over the German
language that he exerted his most
pervasive inﬂuence, and it is as a
German poet that he will be
remembered.

Even so, George condemned the
staleness of VVilhe1mine culture
with an intensity rivaling Nietz-
sche's, by whom he was greatly
inﬂuenced. Through his poems,
and through his journal Blatter fur
die Kunst, George effected a
transformation of German culture

. which, in Morwitz’s estimation, is

as important as that of Goethe or
Heine. Yet to do ‘this he did not
feel the need to resort to some
peculiar poetic fetish. George did

not ‘_‘break” with tradition; rather,’

he sunk his roots deep into the best
of it, and then added to it. He had
that “historical sense” of which
Eliot speaks so highly, and in
staying within his cultural tradition
he transformed that tradition; and
created something new, something
whole, something organically alive.

George knew, as if by instinct,
what could and could not be done
with the German language so that,

in translating Baudelaire, for‘

instance, he. re-worked the idiom
and form of the .poetry to suit his

 

national consciousness.

This volume includes poems
from each of George's seven major
works, with the original German on
facing pages. The translations by
Carol North Valhope (the pseu-
donym of Olga Marx) and Ernst
Morwitz are themselves incom-
parably beautiful. and completely

-faithful to George's Gemian.

Unlike so many previous free-verse
translations, these renderings con-
form exactly to George's masterful
rhyme-schemes and plastic for-
malism. They have succeeded in
transposing into English what
Morwitz calls George’s “three
dimensional language."

George’s poetry ranges from the

highly syncopated, in which lines.

During his lifetime George
resisted all efforts to make him a
poet of the masses, but instead
confined his counsel to and
lavished his attention upon a small
group of altruistic young men who
quickly became known as the
George Kreis (Circle). It is through
these disciples--many of whom
went on to occupy . important
positions in German intellectual »-
life--that George’s legacy was
perpetuated. One of them, Count
Claus von Stauffenberg, was the
man who in 1944 tried to Kill Adolf
Hitler with a bomb. .

The audience applauded loudly, a
sign of acknowledgement.

“The student organizations
enable the Black students to apply
effective pressures on the college
administration by knowing how to
present a good argument to them in
getting the proper allocations for
their budget,” said Carlotta Green
a Mansﬁeld State freshman.
“Relatively, by knowing all the

‘Superﬂy’ or Cadillac’ freaks who

because we must realize how little

Henry Coogler, the acting

soft voice announced that
“Recently, the state legislature

Black Belt Jones:
Slop—Slicl< Disgust

BY M.C. PILECKI

There's never a dearth of bad
movies. Every time you see one
that you ﬁgure has just go to be
Number One on the Greatest
Wastes of Celluloid list, you ﬁnd
one ten times worse.

And there’s different kinds of
bad: disappointing-bad, boring-
bad, insult-to-the-intelligence-bad,
technical-bad, shallow-bad, and a
bunch of other varieties that inspire
the hapless viewer back into the
lost art of reading. But once in
awhile, as you wend your way
through a vast sea of exceptionally
lousy ﬂicks, you come across one
that is so bad it’s good.

Relatively speaking, of course.
Black Belt Jones fits into that
category. Now check this: it’s a
black kung fu undercover cop ﬂick
with a strong female lead and a

collection of Maﬁa types for"

villains. The success formula of the
Seventies! Practically every
exploitation cliche‘ is in this ﬂick.
All it needs is for some one to yell
out “The devil made me do it” to
make Jones a true, representative
collection of modern movie themes.
‘ Nothing so jammed-pack, with
cliches can possibly take itself
seriously, right? Well, on a box
score, it seems like at least half the
cast does, the prop men do, the
scenarist didn’t, the director tries
to and the producers couldn't care
less. .

At first the ﬂick seems like a
parody of all the silly genres
creeping in between the popcorn,
but it probably would not come off
as well if it had been an intentional
parody. It’s just too funny to be
taken for real, but still -to accidental
for satire.

contact me three times. I've had to
move. I am now in hiding.

“I've asked the police if I should
talk to him and they say, ‘Do what

you ‘feel like doing’.”
“The basic issue,” said another
woman, “is that his sex life and her

sex lifehave nothingto do with

whether an exploitive ‘situation

the dual effect of A Case of Rape on

' Spelling, Crzimmar Corrected’

There’s probably a plot intended
somewhere in the movie, but it has
little to do with anything. The
general story is that Black Belt
Jones (Jim Kelly, the non-acting
1971 International Middleweight

Karate Champion who played the »

young black who dies early in
another epic, Enter the Dragon,
Bruce Lee’s lastflick) is a secret
agent, or something, in great
demand.

He learned all his social graces
from “Pop” Byrd (played by
veteran character actor Scatman
Crothers), who runs a karate school
for disadvantaged young black
men. It turns out the Maﬁa wants
the school for a ﬁnancial deal, and
they pull the strings on some black
ﬂunkies who end up killing the old
man. It turns out “Pop” had a
daughter (Gloria Hendry, whose

fresh appearance is a big help to.

this flick),-
revenge. ,

, There’s still more to the “plot,”
but it’s basically just clashes
between the white hoods, the black
hoods and the good guys. _But
since when does plot matter in a
kung fu movie? Or who remembers
it? The basic appeal of these
martial arts routine is the violence--
bloodless and with a certain grace
of movement--especially the abun-
dance of ball busting. And there’s
a lot of it in this one. Kung fu may
yet prove to be one of the most
effective birth control devices yet.
All those kicks...

But there is "just
violence that it ceases to be
disgusting and takes on an air of
slapstick. And everybody and his
old uncle is a kung fu expert, of
course. And practically everybody

Sydney, who vows

is overplaying, to the hilt, each ‘

one’s stereotype.
\

. The most ' rigid character is _
Jones, who is mainly just a pretty
face and rippling musculature.
And puremale chauvinism. Then
there’s Sydney-, certainly the
brightest part of the whole movie,
who is just as good as Jones in the
ﬁeld of ass-whupping (which she
does a lot), and not on‘e to. play the
you-Tarzan-me-stay-home female.

Okay, so it’s_ not the greatest movie
ever made. It’s agood lousy movie
that’s worth sneaking into a theatre
for. It’s certainly not worth the
price of admission, but after you
see it you probably won't demand

your two hours back.

PENN STATE’S RON BROWN, 25, battles Mickey Martin under the

boards for rebound as the Pitt win streak went down the drain at 22

College. photo by Rich Taylor

Skaters,   Topple CM U  

For Sweet Revertge

The Western Pa. Intercollegiate
Hockey Association is back to
normal--from a Pitt standpoint,
that is.

The Pitt Hockey Club revenged a
five game winless slump" against
Carnegie-Mellon University Satur-

~ day night at the Civic Arena by

soundly thrashing the Tartans, 6-1,
to solidify their position on an
eventual first place finish in the‘
regular season.

When the WPIHA was formed
two years ago, there‘ was little
competition for Pitt. C-MU handed
the Panther skaters their ﬁrst
defeat at the hands of a league
opponent last year and continued
the domination of the upstreet
rivalry until last Saturday.

Pitt poured it on, scoring two
goals in each period, four of which
came off the stick of freshman Rick
Vernon. Vernon_ has scored 11
goals in the last three games and
was the, only Panther to light the
red lamp in Pitt’s 6-4 loss to the
Tartans back in December. The
vicious shooting winger was absent
from the last encounter between
the two schools, which ended in a
four all tie.

Vernon rubbed it in on the highly
partisan C.-MU crowd too, skating
by the Tartan bench and pointing to
the scoreboard with a broad grin on
his face. A sign in the stands that
read “C-MU No. 1” was 'tossed
down on the ice at him, but he
merely returned the gesture.

Vernon returned to the first line
and Charly Hagins and Denny

Browne, who also tallied a goal
apiece. Pitt coach Len Barcawlo
used that trio for at least half of the
shifts and the strategy paid off.
Pitt goalie Mark Lieberman
turned away 23 of 24 Tartan shots

to keep his unbeaten , untied streak

alive this year, although the
Panther blue line crew afforded
him with good protection.

The lone Tartan goal came in the
second period on a shot from a bad
angle that beat the Pitt netminder
low on his stick side.-

* In the C-MU nets, it was a
different story. Jeff Hart, who
starred in the Mellon crease for two
years, was removed from the game
after the second period and
replaced by Frank Scuilli. Hart’s
goals against has slipped some-
what this year from last, although
C-MU coach Larry Jacobs’ strategy
could be to save Hart for the
playoffs when the Tartans should
eventually run into Pitt again.

Defenseman Glenn Hyde flaun-
ted the league’s rules on ﬁghting
after some abuse by the Tartan
skaters raised his temper. Hyde
took a hard check’ from C-MU’s
Randy Maneri and returned the
complement, which in turn caused
Maneri to drop his gloves. Hyde
obliged by removing his and
proceed to drop Maneri to the ice
with a quick ﬂurry of punches.
Hyde drew a triple minor on the
play. ,

_ that _it would have to come to an

end sooner or later. If I had to lose
to anyone, I’rn glad it was John
Bach; he’s a ﬁne coach and today
proved it.”

The words came from a calm,
subdued Buzz Ridl, surrounded by
the swell of excitement that was the
aftermath of one of the wildest
scenes that Penn State’s Rec Hall
will-ever’ host. .

Immediately after Ron Brown’s
last second desperate jump shot
from above the key slipped through
the nets cleanly, all bedlam broke
loose. The 7600 State fans, the
fourth largest basketball crowd
ever at Rec Hall, swarmed to the
court to mob their team. Beating
nationally ranked Pitt 66-64 was

. like winning a tournament to them.

A Tom Richards jump shot from
20 feet with a little less than two
minutes in the game gave Pitt a
64-62 lead, the first time they had it
in three minutes. Brown came
back to tie it again as the Nittany
Lions worked the ball to him alone
under the basket.

Buzz Ridl called time out with
1:25 left as the Cats were ready to
inbound the ball. When" they did
come out, they came stalling,
working for the last shot. A minute
and six seconds elapsed before
Brown intentionally fouled Keith
Starr to stop the weave that
Panthers were executing very well.

Pitt brought the ball in unmol-
ested and continued to work it
around for a ﬁnal, sensible shot.

  

With six seconds left, Billy Knight
took a pass at the left side, just
above the top of the key. He was
guarded closely by Brown and tried
to drive around to the left. But
before the ball even hit the court it
was obvious that Knight had
traveled.

The Nittany Lions brought the
ball in after another time out and
fed it to Brown, who was a good ten
feet shy of midcourt. Brown, in his
unpolished New York City back
street style, drove around a pair of
Panthers and from 30 feet pumped
a jumper just before the buzzer that
never touched the rim. Pitt’s

_winning streak ground to a halt at
22.

“It was a desperation shot,” Ridl
said. “It wasn’t a 50 percent shot,
butlit went in.”

The Panthers held a comman-
ding 12 point 48-36 leadjwith just
over 15 minutes in the game but
watched it melt away although they
were controlling the Lions. The
Cats went cold for the next five
minutes, missing eight straight
shots even though they stole the
ball from PSU three times and had
it turned over to them twice.

Brown scored six points in that
span, all on drives to the hoop, and
Tom Doaty dropped two baskets
with proficiency from the left
corner as the Lions whittled the Pitt
lead to three points.

Pitt brought it back to five with
seven minutes remaining but
then the fouls came. Mickey
Martin was nabbed twice, the Cats
turned the ball over and a Starr
foul on Brown sent him to the
charity stripe in a '1-1 situation.
The PSU senior, who lead all
scorers with 32 points, delighted
the crowd by dropping in both

. shots to give his team the lead.

State kept that lead until Knight
tied the game and Richards put the
final Pitt points on the board.
Brown drove to the basket again to
knot the score at 64 all and then

came the Ridl strategy that had 
worked so well against_Temple. I . G

“Our last shot wasn’t necessarily »
intended for Knight,” Ridl ex,-_'

plained. “Actually, he wasn’t
supposed to be out that far."

Pitt took a 36-30 halftime lead,‘ 
although the game was tied on nine ,,
in the first“ 
period. Martin paced the Cats with 
12 of his 18 points in initial 20-77
minutes. Pitt shooters marked well‘ ;

different occasions

in the first half, sinking 50 percent
of the attempts from the field.

Brown put in 12 points to lead 
the Lions 41 percent halftime

average but his 20 point second
half was spectacular. 14 of 20 from
the field, Brown continually chal-

lenged Pitt’s defense in the middle 3.
and continually drove to the hoop “ 
with success. State wound up with ’
a slightly higher shooting percen- P   :.
tage; 47 percent to Pitt’s 44 

percent. ,

Doaty, Randy Meister and Kevin ' 
Burke split the rest of the Lion’s - '
points, each netting 10, while Jon 
Marshall could manage only four,

Martin, 8 of 15 from the field, "led;
the Cats with 18 points, as Knight
continued to have his problems 
finding the range. Mooney hit on 
of 16 with a State defense steadily’,
on his back. Start sunk 10 points.‘ 31
while Lew Hill and Tom Richards‘

Lions Maul Grapple:-s

BY G.W. STEVENS
There is no question that
freshman Rande Stottlemyer has
made a great deal of progress in
only one year of wrestling here at
Pitt. At the beginning of the
season he set a goal for himself--to
make it to the NCAA tournament in
Ames, Iowa. To accomplish this,
Stottlemyeris required to finish in
the top four in this week's Eastern
championships. Unfortunately,
some of the top wrestlers from this
part of the country compete in his
126-pound weight class, among
them John Fritz of Penn State and
Mike Frick of Lehigh.
‘Stottlemyer has worked hard all
season and Saturday afternoon in
Penn State’s Rec Hall he showed
everyone just how far he has come.
He had the nasty assignment of
taking on Fritz [12-1] who last year
as a sophomore won the Eastern
title and went on to finish third in
the ‘nationals; Rande seemed
unimpressed by N Fritz’s accom-
plishments, battling him for three
periods to finally gain a 9-9 draw.
Fritz jumped out to his usual
early lead by a 6-4 count after the
ﬁrst two periods, but Stottlemyer

seemed to come alive in the third
period, becoming the agressor. He
scored two takedowns and an
escape in this period while Fritz
could only manage a pair of
escapes. With only seconds left in
the period, Stottlemyer led 9-8. He
took Fritz down as the buzzer
sounded and the official, John K.
Abraham, signaled two points
which would'have given him an
11-9 victory.
point for a time advantage.) But
after conferring with the scorer,
Abraham reversed his decision, the
reason being that Stottlemyer’s last
takedown came after the buzzer.

In any event, the future looks
bright for Rande Stottlemyer, his
goal being just around the corner.
Unfortunately, the remainder of
the Pitt squad, with the exception
of George Bryant, cannot make the
same claim as the Panthers were
trounced by mighty Penn State,
29-8.

The Lion's awesome power was
just too much for Pitt to handle.
The only other bright spot for the
Panthers was Bryant's third period
pin of Kevin Woodrow in the
opening match.

(Fritz also scored a _

Bryant has three consecutive ‘ ’ '

pins to go with his 7-0 record
making him one of the favorites to
win the 118-pound Eastern title.

But after these ﬁrst two matches,
Pitt was unable to produce as State
locked up the next eightjnatches.

pinned Wally Morrell to give Penn
State a 20-8 advantage.

The last three matches were only
icing on the cake for the Lion
grapplers with Jerry White [13-1]

Minerd and Larry Suhey and
Charlie Getty notching easy vic-

tories over George Calcagnini and

[10-0-1| while the Pitt grapplers
saw their dual meet record drop to
5-12.

But the dual meets aren't really
that important, they simply supply
the collegiate wrestlers with the
necessary experiences to enable
them to compete successfully in the
post-season tournament. The
moment of truth will come'on
Friday night at the Naval Academy
when the EIWA tournament gets
underway. For the Pitt squad, this
will be an opportunity to prove that
they are better than their record
indicates.

Tmckzsters Imp ress ive

At OSU Irwitrttiomtl

BY RICK STOUFFER

It doesn't matter if the layoff is
two weeks or two months. the Pitt
tracksters take everything in stride,
including dominating a class event
like the Ohio State Invitational.

Points for teams were not kept
which was a blessing for the rivals.
Even the big schools like OSU and
Michigan looked at Pitt's 19 points
in awe as they took one first. four
seconds, and two thirds.

The big success story was Rich
Markley in the 1000 yard run.
Markley took first place with a
2:13.2 time. A steady performer all
year, Markley should be used to
winning, taking the 1000 at Pitt’s
own Invitational last month.

The two mile relay team came in
second behind Ashland College.
Second isn't the best but con-
sidering they trimmed two seconds
off their best previous time and ran
the fourth best time in the nation
this year, second place isn’t bad at
all.

The distance medley team took a
third behind tough Bowling Green
and Ohio State with‘ outstanding
performances by Rich Jackson
running the quarter leg and Bob
O’NeiI running the three quarter
part.

“Bob really did an outstanding
job," according to Coach Jim
Banner. “He has been sick all year
and really not up to par. 7He is
definitely going to be a great

help." -:
Nick Martin, who ran a very fast
mile in the medley relay at

Michigan State two weeks ago,
took second place at OSU. “This
was Nick's first time in the open
mile and his inexperience led to a
couple of mistakes," Banner said.

Chuck Mozingo, generally an
excellent performer in the mile or

two mile relay, took a shot at the
880 run finishing a close second,
losing just at the tape.

Freshman Jay Sharpley con-
tinues to perform as a seasoned

~ veteran. He finished fourth at Ohio

State but was leading at,the start.

“Jay was doing very well when
he hit a hurdle breaking his
stride," Banner said. The top
hurdler, Andre Harris, was
scheduled to run his first race in a
month but personal problems kept
him from competing. -

Despite all the good times and
finishes by the team, there were
some sad notes. Freshman Dan
Betterley, outstanding all year on
the distance medley relay and mile
relay, pulled a muscle in the
quarter mile at OSU and may be
lost for the Eastern Champion-
ships. _

“Losing Dan will deﬁnitely cost
us some mobility for the East-
erns," Banner said.

But. the big loss could be Pitt’s
own human pogo stick, Tim Riley.
After clearing the 6,’6 mark, Tim,
whoalready cleared 7’ this year,
barely hit the landing pit on his
6’8” attempt coming down on his
tailbone very hard.

“It was an old pit and with Tim’s
style he was lucky to break his fall
as much as he did,” Banner
explained. “His back has been bad
since birth so this injury only adds
to the problem.” '

“Im very pleased with our boys
as a whole,” Banner continued.
“They all did a fine job and are
anxious for the Easterns (March
first and second). The big question
mark will be Tim (Riley). I am
hoping hisinjury is not as serious
as it could be."

Gymnasts ‘

BY ANDY BEHREND
Quick now: Excluding the
football and basketball teams,

which Pitt varsity squad has clawed

its way up from horrible depths?
The answer is the Panther

gymnastics team. They continued

.their improving ways in losing to

South Connecticut Friday night,
154.85 to 139.40. I

. It was by far the gymnasts’ best
outing in the year, outdistancing
their previous high of 135.30
against Syracuse. .

Once again, the Panther’s
leading performer was Rob Pas-
terick. The-freshman broke his
personal best all-around total by
one-tenth of appoint, scoring 47.20.
Pasterick scored between 8.35 and
9.10 in five of the six events. Only
a poor performance on the pommel
horse [3.60] kept him from an even
more outstanding day.

Ed Swerdlow‘ of Pitt led all his
teammates in the floor exercise and
long horse vault, scoring 8.65 (his
personal high) and 9.15 respec-
tively. Another good vault was
turned in by Don Nixon, who made
his varsity debut an auspicious one
with an 8.5 score.

Jim Kolesar turned in a fine
effort for Coach lg Perez, per-
forming sound routines on the still
rings and parallel bars.

Leading the way for, South
Connecticut was their incredible
all-around man, Jay Whelan. The
junior, who bears a striking
resemblance to Tom Thumb, did
everything well in -scoring his

career best for the six events,

55.25.

Pitt surprised everybody in
performing as well as they did.
Incredibly, they beat South Con-
necticut in the parallel bars, 23.90"
to 21.90. This, as was revealed
later, was due to one of the Owl

. competitors injuring a ﬁnger.

Abiei Grossfeld, South Con-

coach of both the 1968 and 1972
US Olympic gymnastics teams
appeared disgruntled after his’
team’s subpar performance. ,
Perhaps he was looking forward to
the Penn State meet Saturday
[which they subsequently lost,
164.95 to 162.45]. ,

highest total against us. We must
bring out the best in teams.”

Perez himself was pleased with
the crowd response. ‘‘It (the
crowd) helped us a lot tonight. The
guys relax because they know that
people are with them."

Unfortunately, that crowd did
not accompany the Panther gym-
nasts to West Virginia Saturday
night, where the Mountineers
came up with their highest point
total of the year, 149.00, to the
Panthers’ 133.00. Perez said the
judges did a poor job.

“Jim Kolesar, for example did a
more difﬁcyult routine -than on
Friday night, and did alright, but
his score was seven-tenths below
Friday's.”

But the gymnasts’ weekend was
not marred by Saturday's outcome.

After all, when the team’s climb
can be ranked just below that of
nationally ranked football and
basketball teams, that team has
something to be happy about.

Tankers Cop Double Meet

BY YAIER LEHRER

The Pitt swimmers rounded out.

their 1973-74 campaign with wins
over Youngstown State and Mar-
shall University Saturday in double
dual meet action, defeating
Youngstown 79-34 and Marshall by_
a score of 68-40.

The wins give the Panthers their

__best record in over ﬁfteen years

and showed the rest of the Eastern
swim teams that there is another
swim power to contend with
now-—Pitt. The Panthers lost to
Maryland by a technicality and
Kent State barely limped away with
a victory over the Cats. Both these
teams are considered among the
tops in the East.

The Cats won every event at
Youngstown except for the indi-
vidual medley, using many’ of the
second string swimmers.

“We are so complacent about
the times sometimes,” said Coach
Nick Bradshaw,” that we some-

times forget how good our second
stringers are.”

Tom Dowd won the 1000-yard
freestyle race while Mike Mc-
Swain. showing marked improve-
ment in the past few weeks was
able to net ﬁrst place in the 50-yard
freestyle event. McSwain also
swam in the medley relay with
Mark Wallace, Eric Wallace, and
Mark Winters as the team
established a new Youngstown pool
record, of which Pitt holds a good
numberas it is.

Jerry DeMuro swam in only the
500-yard free-style and set a new
pool record at Youngstown as he
and Walt Young continued in their
streakof setting and resetting at
least 15 Pitt records as freshmen.
Both of them have also qualiﬁed for

BY KEVIN NOWE
In a game dominated by jump
balls and backcourt fouls, the
women hoopers soundly defeated

and completed a busy. but
" victorious week accumulating three
victories and one defeat.

A‘ Coach Sandra Bullman used her

starters sparingly and told them

M7"not to shoot, as she went with

freshmen throughout the majority
of the game. The haphazard game
witnessed eight jump balls in the

‘first quarter alone. excluding the

beginning tip. One woman Panther
fouled out and four remained in
jeopardy with four fouls throughout
the fourth quarter. Cal. State
managed to score only one field
goal in the second half, but added
eight points from the charity stripe.

With the women Panthers
leading by 12, 30-18, going into the
fourth quarter, freshmen Terri
Tunie caught fire hitting for 10 on
mostly 20-footers from the top of

the key. Tunie ﬁnished the contest

with 19. Hustling Barb Ewald, in
her best performance of the .year,

Have Productive Week

led the team in rebounds and
added 12 points from the field.

The lone defeat of the week,
Thursday, came at the hands of the
powerhouse of women's basket-
ball, Slippery Rock, 69-33. The
Rocks are undefeated this season,
and held the women to their lowest
scoring output of the year. Mary
Ellen Klochar led the team in
scoring with 13. Bullman noted
that “Slippery Rock is everybody’s
rival. Because they ‘are a phys, ed
school, their girls are in the gym 8
to 10 hours a day."

The women faced Crosstown rival
Carnegie-Mellon Monday and
easily defeated them, 47-34, with
Cathy Cassell leading the way with
15. In a Tuesday afternoon
showdown, the women Panthers
squeaked a 36-34 last minute
victory over Allegheny Community
College. Klobchar was high scorer,
hitting for 12.

In summarizing the long week,
Bullman. noted the developing
maturity of the team as a whole.
“The defense is beginning to come
around, and offensively we were

initially worried about scoring.
But, with the last couple of games
we’ve been hitting well and
averaging close to 50 points per
