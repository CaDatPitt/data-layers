 Rally Commemorrttes

Jackson K iliings

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor T
For the second time in :!s many
weeks. Pitt students gathered to
mourn the killing of college students.
A Monday afternoon rally. called by
the Black Action Society (BASl. com-
memorated the deaths of two black
Jackson State College students. slain
May 14 by police.

A trio of speakers addressed the al-
most 300 listeners scattered across
the Cathedral lawn. Each of the speak-
ers compared the rally with the dem-
onstration that followed the Kent State
massacre. noting that the turnout was
significantly larger for the latter.

STUDENTS sun bathe on the Cathedral
lawn as they listen to speakers at a
‘rally called to protest the slaying of two
students at Jackson Stafe‘Co|lege.

Attributing the shrunken atten-
dance to the fact that the students shot
at Jackson were black. the noon-hour
orators urged whites to overcome ra-
cial differences and work construc-
tively to prevent the reccurrence of

"such tragedies. They exhorted con-

cerned students to boycott classes.
contribute money. and join -a demon-
stration in progress on the Hill.

The Student Worker Project will
have a meeting Sunday, 2 p.m.,
I I9 SU.

Pitt's new coffee house, The
Greaser, will present Ernie Haal<-
ins, blues guitarist, tomorrow night
at 9:30. The house is located in the
,Hunt Room of the Student Union.
The coffee house is open from 6:30
to l a.m.

\

_ A collection of 20th century
prints will be exhibited from May
14 to June 7 in the University's
Art Gallery in the Frick Fine Arts
Building.

through Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m.,
Sunday hours are 2 to 5 p.m. It is
closed on Monday. ’

The gallery is open Tuesday_.

 

At the close of the rally, Nate
Smith, local black leader, volunteered
to lead anyone interested to that rally
on the Hill. Approximately 60 people
accepted Smith’I offer and marched
with him to the rally at Centre Ave.
and Grove St.

Richard l'tley of the BAS casti-
gated students who had attended the
Kent State protest and ignored the
more recent one. The earlier demon-
stration drew roughly 750 people. "We
called this rally.“ he explained. "to
see if whites would help."

Disappointed and angered at the
size of the crowd. L'tley nevertheless
called upon students to participate
Wednesday in a one-day strike and
contribute money to the Jackson State
Defense Fund. (Utley’s plea apparent-
ly was unheeded by most students, as
classes continued as scheduled Wed-
nesday with few absences.)

Repression of blacks was the theme

- of Paul Garver. A history instructor

at Carnegie-Mellon University. Gar-
ver enumerated incidents of blacks be-
ing murdered at Southern schools. in-
cidents that the public never heard
about because of the "racist mass
media."

The first speaker of the sun—drench-
ed afternoon. Garver nted similar-

ities among repressive governmental. ”

actions.’ “When they murder Viet
Cong. Cambodians. blacks. they are

also shooting‘ us."

David Montgomery, history profes-
sor at the University, spoke about the

A need for solidarity between blacks and

whites.j‘The lawn was jammed -for the
Kent State rally,” noted Montgomery.
“There isn’t quite that feeling here
today.” -

Terming the difference in the two‘

responses "a division’ we cannot\af-
ford." Montgomery stated. that “the
time is here to‘ do much. much more

- than protest."

Throughout the rally. which lasted
less than an hour. a collection box cir-
culated among the crowd. All dona-
tions,were earmarked for thd Jackson
State Defense Fund. . '

.-3.‘

by LEE TERKEL ~

About 20 members of the Uni-_,

versity Committee for women’s
Rights (UCWR) staged a.“teach-

in” at the office of Chancellor Wes- V

ley Posvar Monday morning.

Notified of the “teach—in," Dr.
Posvar consented to meet with -the
group to discuss a list of demands.

"The UCWR demanded that: (1) No
recriminations be taken against any
of the members of the women’s group;
(2) At least one‘ half of the eight high
administrative positions that are open

be filled by women; (3) An interdisci-

plinary school for women’s studies be
established) (4) A child day care sys-
tem be set up ‘by the University to\as-'
sist married female students and fac-
ulty members, and (5) The University
commit itself to action on these de-
mands before May 26. ‘

The Chancellor said that he did not
think that the UCWR represented the
sentiment of most of the women affi-
liated with the University.

Dr. Ina Braden. president ofthe
L'CWR. explained how in the last few
months their written requests for re-
from were shunted from committee
to committee and acted upon by none.

She commented. “It is the frustra-
tion of going around in circles that
brought us here today."

Discussion focused on University

hiring practices.

Dr. Posvar said that in his official
capacity as Chancellor he could only
attempt to verbally persuade the de-

. (2) He would give "a ‘high priority."-rjto

ment of personnel to hire more women."_ ‘I’
He added. “We can only replace 
people at the rate they depart. " ' "
The Chancellor then announced his 
appointment of three women to admin- * ‘. '
istrative posts. The women’s group ..
seemed to regard the action as mere , '
tokenism. A -

Dr. Posvarsaid that he failed to
see the logic of setting up a separate

 
 

A member of the group said that
there is a definite need to investigate‘ 
the woman's role within the various 1
fields of discipline.  ’

' She said that other. universities ,
have recognized this need and that 
"schools have been established at Stan-
ford and the University of California.

But the Chancellor commented,
“The University cannot respond .to a
set of demands within a given time.
period.“ - I A is

Dr. Braden estimated that the ire-
forms would cost the University be-;c
tween two and four million dollars.

The"”Chancellor said that therelis g

We are concerned about the
growth of political repression in
our country. We are concerned
about the existence of social injus-
tice in our country, the absence of
democratic control over major
institutions and policies which af-
iect the lives of all people in our
society.

Some of us believe that these
problems can only xe overcome
by building a large. popular move-
ment for soci_al change.

In the United States as a whole,
about 90 per cent of the labor force
is made up of blue collar and white
collar workers, and about 40 per
cent of these people are industrial
laborers; this percentage is even
higher in the industrially-concen-
trated Pittsburgh area.

It’s interesting to note that on
the basis of a recent Gallup Poll.
Newsweek suggests that a major-
ity of blue collar workers oppose
the Cambodia invation.

This is the majority of the peo-
ple. and we've got to begin reach-
ing out to them.

Opinion: Bringing It    Home

The project will involve leaf-
leting at factories and in the com-
munity on a regular, consistent
basis.

Toward this end, some of us are
organizing a summer project.

The purpose of this project will
be to at stimulate thought and dis-
cussion in the broader community
by creating an awareness of the
plausibility of alternative out-

looks on the above problems; bl
work to dispell ignorance and
snobbishness on the part of stu-
dents toward the problems of
working people. and Cl begin to re-
move barriers between students
and workers. _

This is necessary groundwork
for preparing to build a success-
ful movement for social change.

Aside from spontaneous discus-
sions which arise in the course of
leafleting. we will attempt to set
up discussion sessions with stu-
dents and workers.

We will also conduct project
evaluation sessions to discuss our
experiences and develop our think-
ing about what we're doing.

The project will be democrati-
cally controlled. by all people who
accept the basic goals of the pro-

Lewis tried to convince the.

"I think our chances would

The Lions have a 10-3 mark

"It will really be bitter on our

we go out there and beat them
