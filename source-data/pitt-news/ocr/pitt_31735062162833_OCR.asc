.So far, evicting has been-
"light today as expected for

tributed, in the S_enate'elections, to
the increase in _the number of
available positions.”

Lohrentz pointed out that this"

year there are 30 available posts‘ .

in the-Senate, while last year
there were only 11 elected posts ,
in SGA. ‘- . 
Last year 16 people ran for SGA
oﬂices, while _this year 36 people
are running. ‘ _ ‘ ‘ ‘
Two people who had been listed
as.candidates for the Senate have

Schwartz, running for a freshman
' position‘, does not meet the grade
requirement while Constance Cot-
" tingham, does not have enough
credits to run for a junior position.
A totalof 60 is needed, and she

-Universityeln Danger of Losing
Fraternity Row Appropriation

The '$2,600,000 loan that the
university requested from the
Federal Housing and Home Fi-
nance Agency for building a fra-
ternity row has been held up for
this ﬁscal year because the agency
lacks funds. '

Unless ;Congress appropriates
more money for college housing,
the loan may be cancelled entire-
ly. President Eisenhower favors
discontinuing all loans. ‘

To "take the place of the fed-
eral loans, the President sug-
gests that Congress guarantee
loans obtained by colleges from

, private sources.

and‘ Democrat,

At present in the co1lege_hous-
ing loan fund there is ﬁve million
dollars, but this /money must be
used for “runovers”» of loans" that
had been previously granted.

Even if this mpney could be
used for granting new loans, it
could not‘ begin to handle its
$150 million in back applica-
tions.

Pitt had requested the money
to build eigh‘t fraternity houses in
an area bounded by Fifth Ave-

Although a diamond reflects all the colors of a rainbow, a ﬁne

ﬁle clarity or degree of, ﬂawlessness, of a stone is an important
factor in determining value. Rarely is nature absolutely per-

imperfections, the better the stone from this standpoint. Also,

The ﬁrst was an LSU junior named Fred Gaugin. He was .
extremely popular, always ready with a smile, fond of folk
dancing and pralines, and last semester his Chi Psi brothers
unanimously elected him treasurer of the fraternity. This proved
an error. Gaugin, alas, promptly absconded with the money’
and went to_ Tahiti to paint. The fraternity is bending every
effort to extraditc Gaugin, but Tahiti, alas, is currently observ-

A’ The second missing undergraduate is William Cullen Sigafoos, 
Oregon State freslmian, who went one day last fall tma dis-
reputable vendor named A. M. Sashweight to buy a pack of
Marlboros. Mr. Sashweight did not have any M:u'1boros‘be-
cause Marlhoros are only sold by reputable vendors. /However,

he told Sig-afoos that he had another brand which was just as
good, and Sigafoos, being but an innocent freshinan, believed

 

Well ‘sir, you and I know there is no other brand as good as

Marlboros. That ﬁne ﬁlter, that ﬂavorful ﬂavor, that pleasure, A — if

that joy, that fulfillmcnt—are l\Iarlboro’s and i\Iarlboro’s alone.

All of this was quickly apparent to young Sigafoos and he

ﬂew into a terrible rage. “As good as Marlboros indeed!” he.

shrieked, kicking his roommate furiously. “I am going right ~

back to that mendacious Mr. Sashweight and give him a thrash-

ing he won’t soon forget!” /With that he seized his lacrosse bat

and rushed out. V '
Mr. Sushweight heard him coming and ‘started running. Now

taken numerous prizes as a cross-country runner, and he thought

he wouldsoon oiitdistzmce young"Sigafoos. But hepreckoned

Seaboard, bad Mr. S-.ishweiglit will get his lumps from Sigafoos,
you may be sure, and I, forgone, am glad. -

make an unseemly outcry, so she just kept silent. The next

today is lying forgotten on a siding near Valparﬁiso, Indianzt. ,
Fortunately she has plenty of Marlboros with her. "

.'The Elections Committee is an unpublicized arm of
-iudent government. It functions actively for a month or
obefore elections and/perhaps for a few weeks after.
As some of its duties the committee prepares materials

tes, runs the polls and tabulates the votes for student
_e tions. " _
A '‘ Fortunately this year’s politics, unlike those of last
bar, created no problems that required a crucial decision

to see what decisions would have been made’ had there’
been any problems this year. For of the ten members of

te. of the Better Internal Government Party or are work-
actively for that party. ‘ “

 We do not mean to question the integrity of the com-

“Worthwhile Dissernsidn ‘. . '.

Something to

By Deborah Willson

“I’ll certainly be glad when you get over All
'This!” How many of -us have listened helplessly
to one or another of the ‘more sensible genera-
tion’ say something like this? . . .

‘‘All This” might ‘well ‘refer ‘to wearing jeans
and black turtleneck sweaters, or to speaking in
incoherent’ “like ‘man” phrases. ‘ ’ ‘ ~
This part of -our youth-even we
hope we outgrow. But all too '
often ‘,‘This” refers not to these.
adolescent "signs of rebellion
against convention, but t_o any
evidence of criticism of the same
convention. , L,

We question, perhaps, the po-
litical opinions to which our

,families have adhered for‘ gen-.
erations and are met with the
same tolerant ‘smile “You’ll , .
get over it,’,_’ we are told. Or we might venture to
suggest that there is somethingwrong wi_th"‘two-

car and swimming pool success” when it, all comes"

down to “sitting around on the patio small-talking
the world from martini to martini,” as John Ciardi
did in "a recent article. A
Yet "to be Seen » » n

Again we are_ told, “When yougetout into the
Real World you’ll understand.” Apparently, on
entering‘ the business world, pati_os.‘and martinis
acquiresome mystical value not readily evident to
the uninitiated. , ‘ ‘

And the tragedy of the situation is — many of“

us do forget, once we enter the “real world” that
we once had ideas about the things we.thought
were really important. We do become preoccu-
pied with our evening martinis, our lamps in the

-picture window, and who murdered what, night-l‘

, club entertainer‘ this week.

‘Ring’ the Bell for‘A'w.arehness  
Ac||us’r   the? 

dy Ina Amdur 'i

The attitude‘ toward mental health in'.America'

as undergone a signiﬁcant ‘change. A century' ago

mental sickness was kept secret and was thought_

"to be shameful. Now in typically American fashion
we’ve changed‘ the whole idea of rifental sickness
into acfarce. A . '  _ .
I We never bother to define -eith_er the terms
mental sickness or mental health,
nor do- we stop to evaluate the
mental health situation in Amer-
ica. While before no one spoke
about mental health, now every-
one’ speaks about it and no one
knows exactly ‘what he is re-
ferring to. Therefore, when a
psychologist _1ike Erich’ Fromm
speaks on. this subject, as he’ did
on television several weeks‘ ago,
his remarks are worth listening
toI . . “ . ,_ p .

Fromm began with the startling opinion that if
the United States continues with the kind of men-
tal health that it has now, this society will even-
tually disintegrate. The qualities about American
society which cause Fromm to predict its doom are
many. The American cannot bear to be_alone.

Without crowds, ' television sets, cigarettes,
movies and drinks, he is faced with the “embar—

, rassment of havingfree time” and with the‘=pos-
sible solitude which this‘ may cause. Fromm’s

statement is so well illustrated by the articles and
pictures in Life magazine’s issue called “The Good
t[.ife”_tha‘t it needs’ no further emphasis.»

No Idle -Hands -' _ /

The good life to the typical American is the
busy life. In a busy life there isn’t much time to
think, to‘ read or to be disturbed about anything
‘more important than the new_car that one’s neigh-
bor’ has bought. , , ~ 1'

Fromm continues by saying that in America our
culture is concerned with the production and con-
sumption of “things.” Therefore ‘we forget that
people are_;1ot things, and we.are constantly trying
to transform ourselvesvinto inanimate objects.

This transformation is accomplishedmnost easily
by being completely‘ alienated from oneself, by
not feeling intensely about anything, and by,,.stay-
inig no farther than two feet away from the herd.

However, Fromm does not think that we can

' remedy the situation by recruiting a“ number of

horn-rimmed Park Avenue psychiatrists.‘ Frommr

~ criticizes psychiatry and psychiatrists for their at-

R A it °      
We forget we once questioned the wisdom of the

sort of values we now so blandly assume and we:
‘say to our children in college, “Dear me! I’ll cer-

. tainly be glad when you get over All This.”

We become the sort of people who pick up a
book like J. D. Salinger’s “A Catcher in the Rye,”
and.p'ut'it down again after a few chapters, ‘feeling

quite icondescendinxg toward the “obviously de-_

-mented, even slightly dirty little boy who can’t

understand the ‘values of the Real World, and con-
demns it for being “phony.” .
Those Fortunate Enough

Perhaps,‘ though, a few of us will manage to‘ =

ignore the tolerant smiles, and focus our attention
instead, with Camus, on “those few values without‘
which a world, even transformed, is not worth‘
living in.” Perhaps we can, with Howard Lowry‘
of Wooster "College, “seek and obtain the fullest
meaning for our own lives — to know the best, we
.can know, and.to live by that best against all
comers. ' _  ,_

“The human privilege,” he says in‘ part “is to
examine and make reﬂective commitments to prin-

ciples that will exist for us beyond all convenience/’,.~

andgroup pressures.” _ v
Some of us may not outgrow the desire to live

/not just oﬁ the “questionnaires and burgeoning:
‘statistics of our own day, but out of the history"

and signiﬁcant hours of mankind.” ‘We can hope,-

     

. !
- '—W"*.v-IYNHAR-.'w:<->-. «~_-;'-. .i ~55»-_Eﬂ!»v:r-'<v--A4-4'-u-A~‘

again, with'Lowry in his lecture’ at New York ‘Uni-g ~ -

versity, that these values maybecome the armor .

“that gives us protection against settling for some‘
view of ourselves as fractional men, ‘co,rporation_

"men,’-' as members of the lonely crowd.”

We may hope that some’ of us do not forget, do

not outgrow’ critieizing in an ever more mature,’

way the values of our worlds. These are the;
ones among us who will become the Camuses,. the’

A Lowrys and‘-the Reismans of the future. .

which one can be reduced to the -“current level 0133:‘
unhappiness.” ‘Spiritual health 7is not a negative: 
absence of sickness but is distinguished by certain‘: _

characteristics which denote positive well-being. '

A Shade of Difference’

Fromm enumerates the charact_eristics_which he _-
_thinks illustrate the state of _well-being. One of ;_

them is the ability to be alone’ with oneself and

._not to ‘confuse solitude with loneliness.” The human‘
being whom Fromm thinks ,is mentally healthy-
also possesses the capacity for grief and joy.. * ‘

' ‘This. would be a little, upsetting to America’s‘

favoriteuoptimism peddler, Norman Vincent Peale.
What Peale seems to forget in his quaint little syn-
dicated column isthe fact that constant optimism

may show lack of sensitivity mixed with a lack of ‘

realism. _ « - -

It' is this capacity for realism whichh.‘Fromm :

considers to be a further characteristic. of mental
health. Realism is “experiencing the world as it is

and responding ‘to it.” According to this deﬁnition, 
Fromm states, America is one of- the most unrealis-

tic societies that has ever existed. We kid ourselves -
e talk about i
the American respect for individuality and prac- ‘_
tice and enforce the most terrifying kind‘ of/con'- -‘

about loveland confuse it wit sex.

formity. . _
_ Our values which are so false and materialistic
cause us" -to live and die without attempting to
penetrate into the core of our existence and with-
out ﬁnding ﬂsome rationale. "for life. We sell tran-
quilizers and think that a state of unawareness
and non-feeling can~be called happiness.i
Worthless Adjustment A _ _

We are not, according to Fr’omm, living in a
society which could be called sane. It _is sane

‘only in the sense that people adjust to the norms 

which itrequires. The only difficulty is that the
norms are notworth adjustirig to. However, even ’
if our society ‘is, not sane, the individual /can at-

‘tempt to be sane. » . —

He must accept. a certain sense of isolation
which nothing can completely obliterate,: because
each human being is a separateentity and the
space between one human being and another can
never be completely bridged. One must have the
courage to speak and to be heard, to see the truth
and not to despair. ' ~ ‘

It is too late for the older generation-to _assum
these habits. Thus the attempt to return America
to sanity is left to the younger generation.‘ ; ,

If’ our geryration has the desire and the courage ‘
to attempt o mold a new society where people

coach who had been tutoring Pitt’s basketball fortunes for the past
31 years. That year Skyscraper U. lost one of the most colorful char-
acters in the ‘world of sports. If one of our present day students

N "/ wanted to visit with this unusual person he would only have to catch
a little cold or else have some other ailment. ‘

For lurking behind the sport sceneiandi very active in the med-
ical scene is Doctor H. C. Carlson, one’
time coach of the Panther~hoopsters..In his
31 years of guiding the Blue and Gold
Doctor Carlson had ,18 winning seasons}

‘ with 21-0, 23-2 and 20-4 being his best
years. '

He was noted as one ‘of the best bas-

i ketball coaches of his time. He has been
,5 7 recently named to the Melma’s Basketball
' ' Hall of Fame. And no man is more deserv-
, ‘”'i‘r"ig. H -
? Beside being a good basketball coach,
and aiﬁne doctor, Carlson has left behind
him a legend of stories‘ which I think
should be pmentioned here. How true these’
tales are only one with longer years than ‘

 

H. C. Carlson

son for the past three years‘ I’ll have to admit‘ they are not out ‘of.

' his character. ' . ‘

Here are just a few: during the course of a game back in 1950,
an official was crouching in front of him, with the seat of his pants

-1-staring the Doctor right in the eye. Carlsoh could not see the play so

he reached out and gave the official a gentle push. It being a ﬂagrant

t foul to touch_an ofiicials, the man with the whistle wheeled around

E and shouted, “I warn you, Carlson‘, "I’ll call a technical foul.”

'Whereupon the coach ta-rtly' replied, ‘fthen will you kindly quit
sticking your brains inmy face, sir?” ’
, Another time, when he became disgusted with the ladylike
mannerisms of a referee,_he sent his players out for thesecond half
in a conga line withtheir-jackets tied skirt—like around their hips.
As‘ they ‘one-two-three-kicked, their way past said ofiicial, their
coach, who happened to be leading the line, was ordered off the
ﬂoor for the night. , ,

‘r.—_- ' A futile banishment it was, though, for he promtply put on a
babushkas and joined a sorority in the sixth row, from which point

i he and his new—found sisters nearly drove the oﬁicial out of his mind.

: . ' One year down at West Virginia where at capacity crowd of
7000 was booing his players incessantly, Carlson suddenly leaped

;. to his feet. and led the booing with twice the vitality of-any man in
the crowd. Completely startled, the booers ended up cheering the
doctor ‘and his young _men. A ‘ -

i, As for the doctor’s enthusiasm it is nothing short of contagious.
At peak spirit he ohce called upon one of his players, Paul Zehfuss,
to get into the ball game and give his all.‘

I , Zehfuss bounded from the bench; cast off his leggings, and dash-
ed onto the basketball ﬂoor. At ﬁrst the crowd gasped. Then it roar-
ed. Zehfuss had really given his all. ' I V‘ \

The past four stories were related by Myron Cope. f0I‘m€1"1Y Of
the Pitt News and the Pittsburgh .Post-Gazette. This next one I heard
from a friend of mine. - A '

One year the good doctor. had

his team down in Kentucky where

';i _,‘i ,_ they were meeting Adolph Rupp’s Wildcats. The Panthers were get-

ting the worst of it as far as the refereeing was going .and Carlson
was growing madder by the minute. At the start of the second half

in handing ‘them to Rupp ‘saying, “Here, you’ve stolen everything
else you might as well take these.” To this day it is said that the
‘Kentucky coach still has the Panthers warm-up suits. ,

7"“ It must have been quite and experience to be covering the Pitt
basketball ‘scene back when -Doc Carlson was coaching. ’Judging
from these stories-there was never a dull movement whenever a
Carlson coached team" was playing.‘

Now daysthe only thi_ng we have to look forwardito is Coach
Bob Timmons standing up and smiling as-he utters, “Ah come on ref.”
Well maybe someday Timmons will get mad enough to stand up and
lead a conga line past the referee,’ but I jdoubtit.  .

season inline fashion ‘by sweeping
Springﬁeld, West Virginia, and

Annapolis and West Point ‘respec-
tively. Without a doubt the two
