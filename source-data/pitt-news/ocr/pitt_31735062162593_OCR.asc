Invites Chancellor’
To Give Opinions

_“Izvestia,” Moscow‘ newspaper,
and the official organ of the Com-
munist party has invited Chancel-
lor Litchﬁeld to set forth his

.views “as to the signiﬁcance of

the competition between Russia
and the United States.”

‘ The chancellor feels that he
mustianswer in his reply three
questions concerning higher edu-
cation. First, iwhether knowledge
is more important to the Russian
people or the Americans. Second-
ly, “Who will contribute a greater
portion of the national wealth to
the pursuit of knowledge, to the

A transmission of knowledge?” and

thirdly, “Which of us is prepared
to work harder to achieve know-
ledge, to integrate knowledge, and
to apply knowledge.” V

. Litchﬁeld feels the last ques-

 

sophy. In addition to his many
articles in learned and popular
journals, Stace is the author of

such works as “A Critical History . .. V

of Greek Philosophy,” ’ “The

Meaning of Beauty,” “The Des-
tiny of Western Man,” “Religion
and the Modern Mind,,” and “Time

First Chronological Statistics

The University of Pittsburgh
Press has announced publication
on Oct. 2 of “Public Housing in
Action,” by Robert K. Brown, Ben
J. Massell Professor of real estate
at Georgia State,College.

This is the first book of its kind
in its chronological reporting of
the developing housing program
and its operating statistics, and
in its analysis of the impact of tax
exemption and the resultant crea-
tion of the local: subsidy.

.A portion of the book presents
a brief history of the legislative
development of the public hous-
ing program with attention to the
role of social, economic, and po-

litical factors. A case study of
the public housing program of
Pittsburgh is preesnted. _

The conclusion of the book
offers a rent subsidy program as
an alternative to the present pub-
lic housing program.

“Reﬂections on a Changing Image”

Ladius and gentlemen of the
university it has become our cus-
tom at this time of the academic
year to assemble and discuss the
state of the university . . . Today
I should like to review the routes
we have travelled together and
call attention to-some of the land-
marks “I think we" can‘ see ahead.

There are several rgasons for
reviewing the -developments of
the last few years. In the ﬁrst
place much of the story is (new.
to many who are here today. In
the three years since we set out
together the partnership has
changed substantially. ’

One-third of our trustees are

. new to all of us. Of the“774 full-

time members of the university
"faculty, 300 were not with us

and 25 are new to the campus.
Only 18 per cent of the students

._who are heretoday with uswhen

this enterprise began . . .
States‘ ‘Philosophy 
The results of our efforts have
been so comprehensive and re-
sulting from reasons as compli-
cated as the institution itself, to-
day I think we can say that there

‘has been the change as funda-

mental in character
reaching in aspects . . .
As I share in the leadership of
our undertaking, I would like
to offer my own philosophy of
institutional change for your
consideration. In doing so I re-
spectfully suggest that it is not
only the substance of -the philo-
sophy that counts, it is also our
willingness» to permit that pri-
.losophy to actually guide our
behavior. _ ‘

In ‘formulating an institutional
attitude towards change ‘may .I
suggest that we recognize in the
ﬁrst place that rapid change is
part of our atmosphere. The
world of higher education is in
ferment; it is the result of a great
demand of a rising population
and a lesser supply-’ of faculty and
resources with_ which_to meet the
demarfd . . . . _ ‘

Change_ Is‘ Symbol '

But most important, change is
a symbol —- a symbol of man’s
endless search for a better life,
-for higher values, for greater
truths and for a more perfect un-
derstanding. _ .

Formulating our attitude to-
wards change, is it not. also im-
portant to remind ourselves that
an institution is no more static
than life itself? . Change is not
something I suggest to tolerate
but something to postulate,
something ‘to affirm as an in-
tegral part of out strategy of in-
stitutional growth . . .

Finally, in our attitude toward
change, may I again suggest to
you that we remind ourselves that
with rapid change comes increase
in the probability of disagree-
ment and often, perhaps necessa_r-
ily, open conflict. We try to mini-
mize this by open discussion, by
adopting methods of communica-,
tion among ourselves . . .

and \ far

On the. other hand, only a most -

sacralyn WOI‘ship of the modern
cult of human relations should
close our eyes to the inevitability
of some disagreement at some-
time. Our prob1er_n is to minimize
it where we can, and to live with
it where we cannot. . . .
Many Possible Ways. .
We could go in several direc-
tions. We could be a regional in-
stitution or we could turn our
back on our community and seek
only national and international
support and fame. We could." be

4called a professional school and

 

turn to the liberal education
which has been the darling of so

xcerp is From

much of the academic world,. . .

We could develop one profes-
sional school at the expense of
the others and have a one—sided
institution, (planted) in one area,
but poor in others . . .

Let us choose an image, an out-
line as broad and bold as our
opportunity is broad in prospect.
In part we have already made our
choice; we have already begun to
create this image. In doing so we
deliberately chose to commit our-
selves to several propositions . . .
These objectives, I think, ‘ are
three that are primary, and one
that is secondary. ‘

First we are committed to ex-
cellence in education, excellence
in our teaching,‘ excellence in‘
our research, excellence in our
effort to integrate and apply
knowledge, excellence in a sense
that we would be SECOND TO
NONE. ‘ ‘

mitted to an institution which is
dedicated to its community. We
‘variously define community —— in
some cases it is a ratherinarrow
geographical area. In others, as in
the ﬁeld of business education, it
surely is as broad as the indus-
trial region of which we are a
part

Still others, areas of research,
subsequent areas’ such as public
administration, p u b l i (2 health,
surely the community is broader
than the nation and even the
wbrld. . . . ’ -

Contribute to Education

Third, I think we are commit-

ted to the proposition that this is

contribution in the ﬁeld of higher
educaion itself. Of course, a con-
tribution to excellence and of
course a contribution to the serv-
ice of our community, but a con-
tribution beyond that. .A contri-
bution in the sense that we face
and ﬁnd solutions to some of the
troubling problems in engineering
in the ﬁeld of ‘higher education.
A secondary objective "and.

committment "is our committ-

ment to-what we refer to as a

(total -institution. A total insti-

tution as a way of achieving the

ﬁrst three" primary objectives.

Lets.review the record and see
what we’ve done to meetthese
committments which we have so
boldly, and perhaps so frequently,
taken upon ourselves. . . . ' 

V Let us speak of the last one
ﬁrst -— committments to the con-
cept_ of a"total institution. . . .

The creation of the College of
the Academic Disciplines was the
ﬁrst major institutional effort, not
only in this university but any
place in this country, any place
for that matter in the world in
modern times, to re—establish the
role of the disciplines as central
in a body of (ground). . . . A

I would. suggest that il;’s been
rather. easy to_ develop a concept
and develop the structure; it will
be’ much harder in the three
years a-head. I shall report to you
on this again ——- to make this
structure actually work.

Visualize Total Process

There is another aspect of our
committment to the concept of
the total institution -— that is the
concept of higher education as in-
cluding a liberal and professional
education for every citizen. This,
then, visualizes the total process
and the total institution in realiz-
ing that culture.

To make signiﬁcant moves
here I congratulate the faculties
of the School of Business,~. School .
of Education, School of Nurs-
ing and several others in our
efforts to move to the point
where there is opportunity for a
liberal education. before the
: professional education is super-
imposed. ’

I should say that our success
here has been signiﬁcant, but by
no means as widespread as one
might hope to have it. . . . . .
Within the administration we
have" grouped similar things to-

   

gether under vice chancellors to
the end that wewould be able to

In the second place we are com- ‘

an institution seeking to make a .

 

a more thoughtful review of those
problems at the vice chancellor
level than you would everﬁnd in
the chancellor’s office. " ' T

_ Ofﬁce Aids Students

We’ve had a groupingof prob-
lems having to do with the student
as a total human being into the
oﬁice of Student Affairs, so that
a whole concept might have a uni-
ﬁed leadership.

In the administrationwe have
seen the emergence of a Dean’s
Council, at ﬁrst a rather rudi-
mentary body. Gradually now I
think it's taking on more sub-
stance in its discussions and I
think will change as we come to
know one another better to ‘the

have decisio‘ns more quickly andend that a greater degree of aca-

dem’l'c and not just administrative
co-ordination is possible in that
group . . . ' Z = ’
What is new here is that this
is now a total institutional com-
mittment. Also new perhaps is
the concept that excellence is
now at the level of SECOND
TO NONE. Obviously this com-
mittment is going to take us a.
generation to realize. It will
take determined efforts and sus-
tained support and if I may say
so, frugal living in order to
achieve it . . . .
Let’s speak ﬁrst of all of ex-
cellence in the student body. Let’s
speak of quality_ in the students.
This is important in. itself where

 

the good student represents that, ~ it
mucl- improvement within the in<~

stitution.

It is important also . . . because  
as the quality of students im- 

proves, we have a reﬂectionv of the
changing attitude of parents of
students, secondary school people
‘and of education generally to the
changing image ofthe University
of Pittsburgh. Here are a few in
dices of change. ’
Classes Better Others
Every class since 1956, every

entering class, has been better 
(They

and the lowest of the eight com-
petitors, which the Board of
Trustees-selected for us to coin-
pete with, that is the eight best
institutions in the country, was

’ 148 points.

 1" It’s 103 today. More than 25 per
cent of the gap between us and
the leaders in the nation has been
changed in terms of the demon-

..-strated academic ability of the

,,,:.m_en and women who .come into

our "freshman class.

‘  If you want further evidence of
‘it-7-in 1956 only 38 per cent of our
' entering students were in the top
‘_quintile of their graduating class.
_'— Today 51 per cent are in that cate-
ygory. In 1956 we took between
. “four and ﬁve per cent of our peo-
ple who were in the lower quintile;
today only a fraction of one per
cent. . . .
Funds Increased
In an effort to assist the stu-
dent ‘to spend more hours in
study, assist others to come who
couldn't otherwise come . .
scholarships spent by the uni-

versity have increased in that per-‘

iod 141,000 dollars to,314,000;
loans from 6,000 to 284,000; fel-

lowships at the doctoral .level»

which were ‘too few to 150,000

and the fellowships at the post-

doctoral level which were non-
.» existent to over 50,000 dollars.

Not enough, but a signiﬁccnt
change . . . ’

Thus, you have one indication
of behavioral difference. Library
attendance is up over 40 per cent
over the period of 1956. Use of
some materials such as govern-
ment documents is up as much as
150 per cent. . . .

There are still far too many
able students in this Upper Ohio
Valley region who do not come

,__to the University of Pittsburgh

The difference be-.

 

or go any place elsento colleges
or universities. This loss of our

gion and direct responsibility of
any university that hopes to as?
sume leadership in this area.
Thereare problems as far as
our residential students are con-
cerned. Problems of ﬁnding dor-
mitories fast enough. Problems of
creating the contemporative at-
mosphere, which every great uni-
versity should have. . . .
Problems of increasing the
scholarship funds from where
they are now to twice what they
are today, the loan funds from
284,000 (dollars) to at least a half
million, the fellowships from a
total of 185,000 for.all levels, to at
least a half million dollars in the
next three years before I shall
report on this again. ‘

_ Beneﬁts Improved

Let us look at the institution’s
committment to the faculty. . . .
You recall . . . that we didn’t
have sabbatical leavesthree years
ago; we have them now. The
salaries on the average are — in

. the health areas -— 22‘per cent

higher, in other professional
schools,’ 26 per cent higher and in
the disciplines, 33 per cent high-
er -

The fringe beneﬁts are up from
the total institutional commit-
ment in 1956 of only 250,000 do_l—
lars to a committment today in
excess of 560,000 or an increase
of 120 per cent.

The university’s retirement con-
tributions have gone up 54 per
cent and the life insurance cov-
crage up 84 per cent. . . . ‘

Still with reference to the
faculty, may I point out to you
that while we never wish to
eliminate some of our part-time
people, for they will always be
important to us, it is important
to eliminate the excessive num-
ber we had. Since l956 our

  K The Wealr link

The'ch'ancellor’s' convocation speech was a clear, honest

appraisal of the program achieved during the ﬁrst three
‘ years of his controversial administration.-

In his inaugural speech of 1957, Dr. Litchﬁeld outlined
the bold strokes of a regenerative program designed to pro-_
pel the university to the front ranks. of academic excellence.
At that time he hopefully proposed a “ten-year plan” dur-
ing which fund-raising and re—evaluation of the institutional
philosophy would be of paramount importance.

no mention made’ of that “ten-

' year program.” However, the problemsof ﬁnance and ad-

nly among the foremost topics
ﬁscal accomplishments of the

past months, he philosophically observed, “,We must avoid

the feeling that money solves all our problems.” . .
This statement reﬂects a significant shift in emphasis,

perhaps as a result of the understanding that only experi-

ble to “buy” excellence in ed-
The process of academic im-

 _ provement requires scholars, time and cooperation.
 Of the three, time may be the variable which does not

permit one to say that within

ten years we will have reached

the goals. The targets must be set and labored.toward un-
ceasingly. With constant diligence to the task, time will take

 i .care of itself.

In the eyes of the chancellor, cooperation is a three-way
proposition :administration,. faculty and students. Undoubt-
edly, the ﬁrst two groups are with the chancellor..It is dif-
ﬁcult to know if the students are.

Certainly they were not

sufficiently interested in their

share of the partnership to go and just listen to the chan-
cellor’s report. If only‘500 students attended the convocation

in the pitifully empty Memo

rial Hall, this is not a sign of

 " participation,-by any means. With the exception of the Mid-

day Series’ drawing power,

this initial trimester marks a

low in student interest in anything.

Dr." Iuitbhﬁeld pointed with pride to the improved qual-
ity of the student body as indicated by the upward slope of
college board scores in the last four years. This accolade
sounded ironically hollow as his very words bounced around
.in the vacant auditorium. If this void was an expression

_of the sentiment of a “new,

number of full-time people has
increased from 628 to 774, or
more than 25 per cent.

While much has been done with
reference to salaries, to please our
good faculty, and to augment it,
salaries must be inﬁnitely better;
they are only barely competitive
today. The fellowships must be
more numerous at the graduate
level in order to please existing
and encourage new faculty to
come.

Faculty housing is non-existent;
our general physical facilities are
spotty indeed and that all im-
portant resource for scholars, the
library, has had all too little
attention for more than a century.

‘Faculty Lags

We’ve done very little to reduce
teaching loads. If I may sosto the:
members of the faculty, I think
we alsohave a problem'of too few
inter-faculty seminars and re-
search programs. There is a great
deal to be done for the faculty.
There.is also, in my judgment, a
great deal that the faculty can
do for themselves.

As far asexcellence in educa-
tion is concerned, we are also
committed‘ to what is perhaps
the mostgimportant thing’ here
———the improvement of curricula
in teaching . . . We’ve been
through the process during the

hole institution of- the philoso-
phy and general objectives of"
the school and faculty, of spe-
ciﬁc teaching objectives, for
principal student groups, princi-

. pal levels of -instruction, of cur- ,

ricula, course‘ offerings and a
preview of teaching’ procedures
in each of those courses. ‘
It’s too early to draw many con-
clusions.‘ Some areas have pur-
sued with vigorous constructive
ﬁgures. Some parts of the faculty,
less sq. It’s hard for any ofius to
see that this is a problem not-only
of the substance of the\ course_
materials, but there is an import-
ance behavioral aspect in terms
of intellectuals skills that are in-
volved as well. I
' Evaluation Nears
We’,re preparing’ for a general
evaluation of the institution in
the fall of 1960 when the Middle
States Assn. comes for accredit-

.last year of the review in the '

ing purposes and when the pro-
_fessional societies in all of ‘the
schools that are represented here
‘will also come to again review, in
their own speciﬁc way, the quality
of the instructional program of
the University of Pittsburgh.

I would like to invite speciﬁc-
ally the students here to comment
to their faculty colleagues on their
views as to what needs to be done
about curricula, about individual
courses and about the teaching
methods employed therein. I
would like to encourage other
members of the faculty to com-
ment in ﬁelds other than their
own, about things that they think
are important that other facul-
ies do. . . . ‘

Until we arevsatisﬁed that all
of our curricula are" SECOND
' T0 NONE in the nation," then
. there is time for urgent review.
When we .are.satisﬁed that we
have achieved that position of
leadership, the urgency becomes.
even greater.

In terms _of excellence in edu-
cation, weare also committed to
the concept of year-round‘educa-
tion. . . ,. ' ’

It’s too. early to appraise the
probable results. There are a few
scattered" straws in the wind. We
know this year’s present class is
larger because the idea has caught
the fancy and perhaps there serv-
ice therefore is servicing the needs
of those who are coming on to the
university‘ today. ’

' "Calendar Holds Interest

Weknow that there is a virtual
avalanche of interest in other fac-
-ulties in other parts of the coun-
try in what we’re attempting t_o

‘ ‘do. Whether, or not this is the real

answer we’ll know better when I
report again threeyears from
now. . . .’

Essential to the committment to
excellence are many types of sup-
port.. Library support, plant and
equipment support, support of .a
contemplative, atmoshere. Let’s
look at the record as far as these
points are concerned.

Library appropriation for all
libraries ‘on ‘the campus today
‘compared with 1956 is up 172
per “cent per (course). The seaff
_costs in library ‘ which are . in
some cases almost as‘ -important‘
asthe books . . . are up 54’ per
cent. Overall institutional in-
vestment in libraries, all things
are considered, is up 81 per cent.

We are spending today better

7General Studies

than half a million dollars on our
library. Not enough, but a ‘very
distinct improvement . . . '1 i

of our committment to date for

two hundred thousan'd dollars . . .
We need to invest at least 12

million dollars in a central library;
the Student Union . . . is still in
need of drastic expansion . . .
And the two long—negelected areas,
Engineering and the Sciences, we
have a long way to go . . . .

‘ Must Avoid Things

Whether (contributions) con-
tinue I tink depends apparently
upon avoiding several things . . .
avoiding feelings that money solv-
es all our problems . . . avoiding
the concept that they owe us te
money . . .
people with the magnitude of
our requests. . .

‘Apathetic’ One Gives

Pros, Cons of News
Editor, the Pitt News: ,

I am one of the “apathetic”
students at Pitt. You may won-
der why I’m “apathetic.” ﬁI
didn’t get out my turkey quill
and scribble a protest note about
Mr. K’s visit because I approved.
At least for ‘a few short days I
wasn’t afraid of getting blown
to high heaven) by the Russians.

His visit didn’t do me any
personal harm, except the swol-
len feet I got waiting for Mr.
Khrushchev to appear. There
must have been someone in
school who/didn’t cotton to the
idea of Mr. K. coming, but why
should he write to you? ’

In the four issues of the Pitt
News that I have here — Sept.
28, and Oct. 5, 7 and 12 —— I
ﬁnd no letters to the editor
column. The only letter that ‘I

printed is one of the head cheer-

leader, Knobby Knouse. Print

something by a few average stu-

dents and maybe you’ll get
enough letters to support this
type of column.

If you think that we are all
apathetic and don’t notice any-'
thing, I’ll give you some of my
complaints about your paper that
you may think we “apathetic”
students have overlooked: '

1. I could write a funnier col-
umn than Deborah Willson with
my inkwell tied behind my
back. — -
2. In your front page story on
Oct. ,12..concerning the address
by "Dr. Litchﬁeld, full detail is

  
 
 

can remember that I’ve seen _

   
  

1 given, to what'..the chancellor and ~

faculty are supposed to do, but
_the complete omission of what
the students are to do and
where they are to go makes this
story almost useless.

3. Ina Amdur’s column about
death and philosophy -was as in-
teresting as a thesis on the sex
habits of a ladybug. ,

. Now that I’ve.given you a few
of my complaints,‘ I would like
to ‘pass out a few medals. One
will go to the photographer who
covered the Khrushchev ‘visit.
Those pictures are excellent. ,

Your sports. coverage is good.

.You cover not only soccer and
football, but also cross country‘.
The only exception to your ﬁne
sports’ coverage is “The Game
of the Weak.” It is neither in-
formative nor funny. The Yogi
game lends some sport to sports.

If I knew some of these people .

a little better, it might be still
more interesting. —

The last blow that I deliver
will be your comment on the
voting. "How are the freshmen
supposed to choose the best can-
didate from among people they
don’t know? I'was surprised that
‘the freshmen led in the voting.
It must- be the novelty of the
thing. There is no excuse for the
sophomores on up not voting. It
seems to me that there is too
much apathy at Pitt.

true, but the examples given
were misleading asthe reason-
ing, or lack of it. If we investi-
gate this subject closely, the
season for this apathy is obvious.
Pitt is not a campus school. Its
students (the majority) com-
mute and therefore lead lives
outside of the campus; they
work, have many non-college
friends, etc.

Then to the typical Pitt stu-
dent, school is a serious busi-
ness; it is a means to an end.

Participating in extra-curricular .'

activities is also a part of school,
but to haul off in demonstration
against Mr.‘ K., when our‘ own
President tells -us to welcome
him favorably or quietly, is in
bad taste. ' ‘ .

Wouldn’t it be astonishing if
after Mr. Khrus_hchev’ss entire
tour without incident, he was
suddenly verbally attacked by a
group of college students? Why
hang Mr. Michelosen in effigy
when his team lost to Nebraska?
Do we give him— a bonus when
"his team beats a favorite? Does
this football loss ‘lower the
quality of our hard-earned‘ di-
plomas?

We at Pitt do not need a-Pied
Piper to lead us in campus de-
struction.- We are leaders; not
followers. We do not have time
for such college pranks. This is

"-The Republican Party ha

"the last 25 years.”— That was

Councilman David Olbum in
Thursday afternoon.

Olbum substituted for Stat
cratic candidate for mayor of

s not had an» original idea in
the lead statement made by
a speech delivered here last

e Senator Joseph Barr, Demo-
Pittsburgh. Barr was unable

to attend the meeting because the¢
legislature in Harrisburg is still
in session. -

Olbum stated that the Repub-
lican party is not aware of the

election is whether the party that
is given power ‘will continue the
Pittsburgh redevelopment pro-
gram. Then, if so, will the people
of Pittsburgh be persuaded that
the same services will be pro-
vided with no increase in taxes?”

Gateway Financed Privately

The students were reminded by
Olbum that the entire Pittsburgh
redevelopment program was plan-
ned and carried out by the Demo-
cratic party, in cooperation with
civic—minded citizens. He continu-

C_enter'redevelopment was com-
pletely ﬁnanced by private capital,
not one centof public funds be-
ing used.

There was at least one skep-
tical student in the audience,
however. “I’ve been in Pitts-
burgh for two years and I
haven’t seen a horse,” this stu-
dent commented. “I can’t un-
derstand it, either; the streets
here are maintained in a condi-
tion conducive to travel by
horse.” ,

Olbum’s reply was, “I believe
Pittsbugrh streets are maintained
in a condition comparabl_e to any
other city of comparable size and
population.” He was hissed by the
crowd, however.

Urges Large Turnout

Finally, Olbum urged everyone
of voting age to participate in
this fall’s elections.

. Olbum is a graduate of Schen-

Iey High School and the Uni-

a degree in law and in business
- administration.

He has served as a member of ,
the. Department of Elections of

Allegheny County, Director of
Public Safety, and a member (if
the Allegheny County Sanitary
Authority. ‘

This political speech by David
.Olbum and the previous talk by
Paul Reinhold were sponsored by
the School. of Engineering and
Mines of the university.

“Breather” Beemes
 Cats in 23-15 Shocker it   4;  
   West Virginia Outplays

, By TED COLTON
Nebraska came early this year for the Panthers, as they
vwere upset by a ﬁred up West Virginia team 23-15 at Mor-
gantown, W. Va., Saturday before an estimated homecoming

crowd of 30,000.

 Last year a bowl bound Panther team traveled westward
for their only “breather” of the season, Nebraska. ‘They were

‘beaten 14-6; Saturday the CatsO"r----'-~-

traveled southward,‘ they were
-not bowl bound,’ and it was earlier
'irz‘the season. ' A
(‘West Virginia was the “breath-
é'i"’,befo1'e the rough’ part of their
‘schedule. The situation was sim-
ilar and ,the results were the
same. . V’
_ Rated As Underdogs

, The Mountaineers, who had
looked like anything but a good
football team i.n their first four
outings were listed as a 14 point
underdog.

The Panthers held West Vir-
ginia on the first three plays.
.Fred Riddle took the punt and
"ran it back to the Cats’ 49 yard
line. ’ .

On the next four plays the
Panthcrsran through the Moun-
taineers line as though it were
water. The ball ended up on
WVU’s 16 yard line.

Then‘ the Panthers . received
quite a shock. Art Lewis, Moun-
taineer coach, had started ten
sophomores and one junior.'He

.quickly sent in the number one

unit and the picture ‘changed
rapidly.

. _ First Quarter Typical

‘ The Panthers moved to the sev-
en but lost the ball on downs.
The rest of the first quarter was
a typical Panther first period with
both teams battling between the
25 yard markers. .

Early in the second quarter
"the Cats got their only break of
the ball game when WVU tried
a quick kick .deep in their own
territory. It was the sophomore,
again. who was in there.

Norton Seaman, Panther Guard,
broke ~through and blocked the
kick and teammate Dick Mills
giavthered it up on about the seven
and took it over for the score.
Seamen added the extra point.

‘From there the Mountaineers

took-over. Last Tuesday at the

Pitt Football luncheon at Frankie
Gustine-’s, Coach Steve Petro who
had scouted the Mountaineers
most of the year stated, “This
team has real good quarterback-

 

‘,\Typical 1F"Le

   
   

TYPICAL OF INTERFRATENITY plays is Harvey Katofski’s pass

ing. They like to run the ball and
throw w-hi1_e'they are on the run.”

‘V Watch Williams, Coach Says

He continued, “The boy we are
going to have to watch Saturday
is Danny Williams. He is ,a real
good one.” "Well, it so happened
that Williams had only seen limit-
ed action-.in all of the WVU games
so far this season. '

Petro’s quotes drew many
chuckles from the writers who
were present but it was Petro
who had the last laugh. Wil-
liams turned in a magnicent job
as he ran and threw the Moun-
ties to victory. ‘

The Panthers ends could not
cope with‘ Williams as he rolled
out and wouldeither throw, if
the secondary would come up, or
he would run if the Cats dropped
back. - '

C o a c h Johnny Michelosen’s
squad was not completely out-
classed by the Mountaineers as
they showed signs of being a 14
point favorite throughout the
game. But everytime the Panth-
ers would get a drive going they
would lose the ball on either a
fumble or i_ntercepted pass.

Rushed on Passes

Mostly it was the latter as
Quarterback Ivan Toncic had ﬁve
of his aerials caught by the West
Virginians. Toncic was rushed on
most of his tosses and as a result
they were short or else a line-
man would get a piece of the ball
and send it up into the air like a
free-for-all pass. When the ball
came down it was usually a
Mountaineer who was under it.

The Mountaineers scored on a
roll out’ pass from Williams to

Back John Marra. The play

covered 12 yards. Kicking Spe-

cialist John Thackston added the

extra point and then ‘kicked a

30 yard ﬁeld goal, all in the

second.-period. In the third

quarter Williams went over
from the one and Thackston
again added the point.

Meet  30  
A gain.-St W V U

_ By DAVID LEVINE
Panther’ harrier Ron Rush

Cross-country record in the
Cats 26-30 loss to the ’Moun-
taineérs last Saturday after-
noon. 'Rush negotiated the
4.2 mile course in 21:21, smashing
the old mark by a half minute.
After assuming a commanding
lead at the 2 mile -mark, Rush
easily coasted home the winner.
A key factor‘ in the Panther
loss was Blue and Gold harrier
Reed Clarke. Clarke, who has
been suffering with the flu, was
not able to place better than elev-

\

'enth. _A healthy Clarke would

have had no trouble, placing in
the top five.‘ _
The runners were spread out
all over the course and there
wasn’t a close finish in the -meet.
Also placing for the Cats were
Bob Stuck, Bill I-Iinchberger, and
Mickey Jupina, ‘who. placed
fourth, fifth and ninth respective-
ly. ‘ l

  

The Panther freshmen team

beat the highly touted Moun-
taineer frosh 24-31.
Not to be out done by Varsity
star Rush, freshman Harry
A Stokes broke the ‘existing rec-
ord for the 3.1 mile frosh course.

Stokes wrecked the old stand-
ard by 36 seconds, completing the
run in 17:01.-Running second to
Stokes was Vance Carter.

Neither Stokes nor Carter had
had any previous cross-country
experience prior to attending col-
lege. Yet both of them are easily
outclistancing veteran runners.

John Pringle, Bob Tarkany
and Jon Hart placed ﬁfth, sev-
enth and ninth respectively for
the Panthers.

The win gives the Cats frosh
team a 2-1 record. '

of the _whole national work

the disciplining force of Purit-

a ﬁnal exam. This will give stu-
dents an opportunity to see Eu-

Study of Art and A Architecture.
of Western Europe, and the Civ-

cost of round trip transportation
will be approximately one half
of the lowest commercial prices.’
The plane will leave from
Greater Pittsburgh Airport on

Aug. 2 and return Sept. 7. This
will eliminate the cost of trans-
portation to New York and will
allow the students to return in
time for the third tri-mester at
the university.
New Dimension Added

According to Dr. Kolbert, “the
whole purpose of this European
idea _is to_ provide the student of
the university with what "has
often been called an “Internation-
al Dimension.” .

It. is a cliche to call the
world, a shrinking globe, yet
there is a great deal of truth in
many cliches. It is almost un-

thinkable for a student in 1960 o
' tohave a first class liberal edu- ‘

cation without contact with cul-
’ ture and civiliiation of the coun-

  ran:

‘ lightened group. Dr. Jack Kolbert, chairman of, the Modern

tries which helped form our own
culture and civilization.”

A number of faculty members
are being considered for the trip,
but a number of.‘ seats are being
reserved for students. Students
wishing to go will have enough
time to brush up on their lan-
g11a.g€S- _

- More Trips

In the future the university
hopes to sponsor four, six, and
eight week trips, but because of
limited equipment this will be ‘the
only.trip available this year.

Applications may be obtained
from Marilyn Olsen, at the Office
of Cultural Exchange, Building
A- Preference will be given to
those students who apply first.

-To remain on the list a stu-
dent .must deposit $25 (non-re-
fundable) by Dec. 1; $70 by Jan.
1; and $100 by Feb. 1. The total
cost for the round-trip, includ-
ing taxes and insurance, ‘will be
$295.

In his speech Menderes stress-

nomic advances of the Turkish

' _ people and their desire for a
long and lasting 1? r e e d o m
throughout the entire world.

' “We in Turkey are determined‘

to continue to advance in demo-
cratic freedom to enhance our
economy and raise‘ the standard
of living of our _people in order
to discharge fully our duties and
responsibilities within the com-
munity of freEdom-loving na-

' Peace Sought
_ ‘_‘In our endeavors we are con-
scious and proud of the fact that
we. are marching forward hand-
in-hand with the United States
in the pursuit of a just and dur-
' able peace.” . .
Mederes came into the inter-
national limelight almost imme-
diately after forming his first
I cabinet in 1950. In 1945 he had
resigned from the single ruling
party, the People’s Party, and
together with Cola] Bayar (now
President of Turkey) formed the
Democratic Party. »
iThis party, which stood for a
more liberal and democratic re-
gime, won a landslide victory in
1950, in the ﬁrst free and fair
’ e1e'ction in Turkish history.’

He is a graduate of the Amer-
ican College in Izmir and the
Ankara Law School. Before he
entered law school," he spent
three years as a member of the
guerilla forces ﬁghting "the" ar-
mies which invaded Turkey in
1920.

Later he was commissioned as

"a ‘reserve officer and served gal-

lantly in the Liberation Army.
He could only resume school after
their victory in 1923.
