Graduation date finalized despite student opposition

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Despite protests from Jewish
students, the Student Government
Board and the Black Action
Society, the University of
Pittsburgh has ﬁnalized plans to
change April's graduation date to
a Saturday.

“We are disturbed that the
university has made a. decision
that obviously shuts off a great
many people. In its final decision
they have a made a statement of

exclusion,” said Leon Morris, a
senior religious studies major.
Morris protested to university
officials after hearing reports in
the beginning of the winter term
that the date would be changed
from Sunday, April 29 to
Saturday, April 28. University
officials had tentatively switched
the date because of a scheduling
problem with the Civic Arena
involving the hockey playoffs.
“After meeting with university
ofﬁcials to discuss the problem
and talk about options, we are

grateful to them for exploring
some options but we are still
upset about the decision to have
the ceremonies on the date of the
Sabbath,” said Morris.

The Sabbath is a totally spiritual
day which does not depend on
the mechanics of the outside
world; therefore, a function like
graduation on a Saturday would
pose a problem for all Jews,
regardless of denomination,
according to Rabbijose ph Levine,
director of Pitt’s B’nai B’rith Hillel.

“This day is unique in that it

emphasizes the idea that time
and space are suspended in order
for us to reflect,” said Levine.

The university is offering a
private presentation of diplomas
for students who cannot attend
for religious reasons.

“Anyone who wishes to attend
can participate in the private
ceremony. We explored all
options exhaustively before
making this decision, and it has
been determined that Saturday is
the only viable option,” said Bob
Reteshka of University Relations.

  

The date change also poses
problems for the Black Action
Society, who scheduled their
annual senior banquet for that
Saturday.

“We are now sending out
letters to seniors to see if they
will be staying that night so that
they can attend the dinner. I've
had an opportunity to speak
with someone from the
university about this, and I now
understand the reasons why they
had to change it,” said Terri

Censorship awareness promoted on Pitt campus

By Jenifer Crook
Asst. News Editor

Hoping to help end all forms of
censorship, including the passage
of a state bill that would require
warning labels on music with
“offensive” lyrics, a group of Pitt
students sponsored Censorship
Awareness Day in the William
Pitt Union on Monday.

“We are concerned, even
frightened, by attacks on our right
to learn, listen to music, and
express art,” said Mark Smith,

coordinator of the event. “When
a few censors make a big deal
over a Madonna ad, when a small
group is able to dictate to the
whole American public what they
can see, that’s wrong.”

The group is especially angered
by a bill, sponsored by Rep. Ron
Gamble, which recently passed
through the Pennsylvania House
of Representatives. If approved
by the state senate, record retailers
will be responsible for labeling
offensive music and will be
penalized if caught selling labeled

items to minors.

At their booth, the Pitt students
stopped passers-by and asked
them to sign petitions against
Gamble’s proposal.

Mike Mikelas, a Pitt freshman,
said that he is concerned about
the bill.

“You aren’t forced to listen to
anything that you don’t want to.
This kind of censorship just takes
away from your choices,” he said.

Freshman Pete Kovacs agreed.

“I've known it’s been going on,
and I'm glad that someone is

finally doing something about
this at Pitt.” Sponsors of
Censorship Awareness Day,
including students from many
campus organizations such as the
Common Ground Coalition, the
Bisexual Gay and Lesbian Alliance
and the Campus Women's
Organization, also cited other
examples of censorship,
including:

-The three major networks’
refusals to air birth-control
advertisements, even condom
ads, because “a few extremist

censors threaten the networks.”
oABC’s “thirtysomething”
coming under attack because two
gay male characters “touched and
were portrayed in a positive
manner.” Because of viewer
pressure on advertisers, ABC has
lost $1.5 million in revenue.
-The efforts of censorship
groups to ban certain books from
public schools. “Concerned
Women for America fought to
remove The Wizard of Oz from a
public-school library because of

Campus organizations
receive a new FRIEND

By Iaurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

Hoping to solve some of the
social problems that plague
a new club
called FRIEND has formed on
campus.

Standing for Friends Resolving
Issues through Education,
Negotiation and Discussion, the
club is a result of a class called the
History of Blacks andJews, which
is taught by Barbara Burstin, club
adviser, and Ron Glasco.
According to Therston Winbush,
club president and co-founder,
the class centralized on how both
histories are similar, and they
decided to originate the club based
on these similarities.

“The actual concept came from
Cindy Goodman-Leib, who works

.with Pitt’s Jewish Social

Organization Hillel and who also
is a co-founder of the FRIEND
club. She is the mother of this
club. Originally, the club was
going to be a black and Jewish
club, but we decided to involve
all cultures due to the high degree
of separation on campus,” said
Timothy Jackson, co-founder of
FRIEND. . 1

Through FRIEND, various
opinions and cultures can come
together, said Jackson.

“We saw a need for this
organization on campus,” Jackson
added.

“People have misconceptions
about other cultures,” said
Winbush.

According to Winbush, there
are approximately 42 members
involved in the club. Presently,
the membership participation is

the occult references; they didn’t
like the witches,” said Smith.

“They should just change the
channel if they don’t like the
show,” said WPTS’ Chuck Van
Keuren, who was working at the
booth. “Just say you don’t like it;
that’s free speech. But don’t try
and force me to do what I don’t
want to do.”'

“These censors are pushing
their religious views on us. They
think they can tell everyone what
is okay, ” said Hyla Urbany, adding
that she and other students are
attempting to form an official
campus anti—censorship group.

“I don’t think enough people
are aware that this is going on,”
Urbany said. “It doesn’t really
affect you until it hits home in
your ownstate, and it’s happening
right here, right now.”

low because it is a new
organization. The main function
of the club is to act as a bridge for
other groups on campus, said
Winbush.

Recently, the FRIEND club
joined the Black Action Society
and Hillel to have a Shabbat
Dinner in honor of Dr. Martin
Luther King and the civil—rights
movement. The dinner also
involved students from Carnegie
Mellon University.

On Jan. 19, approximately 30
people from Pitt met in front of
the William Pitt Union where a
candlelight ceremony started the
event as they walked to Hillel on
North Craig Street to meet with
CMU students, Winbush said.

“lAs a result oil the Shabbat
Dinner, a young lady from the
Jewish Chronicle wants the
FRIEND club to help work out a
strategy centralizing on the Israeli/
Egyptian Pact hoping to help end
the war,” said Jackson.

Winbush added, “We want to
become more visible on campus
so other groups and organizations
know we can function with them.
If they need someone to work
with them, we can work as go-
betweens.”

A, definite short-term goal of
the FRIEND club is to increase
membership. Winbush is
interested in recruiting members
of other organizations.

“The only way to break
ignorance is to get people talking
and communicating. People
basically have the same wants
and needs. No one wants to feel
as if he or she is less than another

person because he or she is a

different color,” said Winbush.

In the long run, Winbush hopes
the FRIEND club will function
with other campuses in a
networking fashion.

Polish students adjust to Pitt

By Jennifer Shusko
For The Pitt News

For the four new Polish
exchange students studying at
Pitt, introduction to American

life ' was anything but
encouraging.
Their ﬂight from New York

to Pittsburgh was delayed two
days because of the weather.
When the students ﬁnally
arrived in Oakland, they still
had to face one of every Pitt
students’ worst nightmares:
registration.

“I like the computer stuff,
but at the same time there's
too much bureaucracy,” said
Agnieszka Bovdzinska.

Bovdzinska didn’t have any

problems getting special-
permission slips for her classes,
but walking from Thackeray
Hall to the Cathedral of Learning
and other buildings on campus
took even longer than it does
for most students since she’s
not yet accustomed to the
campus.

“In Poland it’s different,” she
added. “When we study, our
program is set. I know at the
end of one year my program,
my schedule and my teachers.”

Unlike the other three Polish
students who are assigned to
stay in Bruce Hall, Malek
Jedlinski is living in McCormick.

“I’ve never lived in a dorm
before, and I was shocked.
There was a lot of trash on the

floor_ and dirt. I wanted to
change where I was staying
and live with my friends. Idid
it quite easily. It wasn’t much
of a problem, but just the first
impression I had was scary,”
said Jedlinski.

This is the first time Pitt has
had exchange students from
Poland on an undergraduate
level. In previous years, Pitt
has exchanged graduate
students and faculty members
with the University of Lodz in
Poland.

“Since we have close
connections with the
University of Lodz from
‘previous years of exchanging

The Pitt News

For students looking to gain some
practical work experience, Pitt's internship
ofﬁce on the Cathedral of Learning’s ninth
ﬂoor can start them off in the right direction.

“A student should come to the ofﬁce at
least two or three, months before the actual
starting date of the internship. This gives
them time to get the paperwork done and
enough time to ﬁnd a faculty sponsor. This
also avoids waiting until the last minute to
get everything done,” said Mary Kujawski,
assistant to the director of Special Student
Programs.

Once students decide to intern, they
should make sure that they are eligible.
Students in the College Of Arts and Sciences
should have at least a 2.0 QPA and at least
55 credits. They also must have completed
at least two courses in the department in
which they hope to receive credit.

After fulfilling the qualifications
necessary for an internship, further
information may be found at the internship
office, where students will find registration
forms to complete. The student then must
decide on what kind of internship would

be most beneﬁcial .

Binders in the internship office provide
varied information concerning available
internships. Career options are classiﬁed
according to the student’s area of study,
such as business, communications and
engineering. Students are encouraged to
go through these binders and pick out the
internships that appeal to them.

After they have chosen what type of
internship best suits their interests, students
should read about the particular employer

L who will accept them. Then the intern

should contact the employer and set up
an interview.

Julie Longenecker, a senior
communications major, is entering her
second internship this semester.

“I applied for [my first internship] at the
beginning of the winter term,” said
Longenecker, adding that she was under
the impression that she would be interning
during the semester she applied. As it
turned out, she wound up interning for
Pittsburgh Magazine between April and
July of her junior year.

After being accepted by the employer,
the prospective intern then reports back
to the internship office. The intern then
has to find a full- time faculty sponsor that

THE Pl'I'I' NEWS, Wednesday, January 24, 1990

Internships provide experience and career insight

will determine the amount of credits that
will be counted toward the internship.

Kujawski warns students that the number
of hours that they put into their internship
may not be the same number of hours for
which they receive credit “The credits
that they receive for their internship are
determined by the faculty sponsor and
the academic work that they do for that
faculty sponsor, not the number of hours
they do at the internship site," she said.

After meeting with the faculty sponsor,
the intern then has to come back to the
ofﬁce for a contract. The contract consists
of signatures from the faculty sponsor,
intern, department chairman and
supervisor. The site supervisor must also
complete a part of the contract.

“There are many companies that we
deal with. We do deal with many of the
larger companies [in the Pittsburgh areal,”
said Kujawski. “We deal with USX, some
of the major hospitals and United Parcel
lservicel."

The internship ofﬁce has many
opportunities posted. Employers range
from Mobay to Newsweek. Many
companies even set up special programs
for the interns.

“I really wasn't sure what I would be

doing. I did work for the marketing
coordinator, public relations, and account
executives [at Pittsburgh Magazmel,” said
Longenecker. “I got the feel of how the
whole thing works on that side of

advertising. ” 1-

As she enters her second internship,
with W/inter’s Advertising in Mt. Lebanon,
Longenecker has learned, “If you could
just sit down [with a potential employer]
and tell them what you want to get out of
it, I think they’ll be really understanding."

“Some [interns] are paid, and some are
volunteers,” states Kujawski. The salary
for each internship is determined by the
employer of the intern. Some interns are
hired during the summer, and other
students choose to do their internships
during the academic school year.

Longenecker has also realized the
advantage of working for a small company.

“[In a smaller company] you tend to get
more one—on—one experience». I'm seeing
every aspect of advertising, whereas if you
work for a big company, specialization is
more common."

Kujawski concludes, “It gives them an
opportunity to see if the job that they are
seeking after graduation is what they want
to do.”

’W/ormmg’ his way to prison

A 12—person jury convicted former Cornell University
graduate student Robert T. Morris yesterday on federal
computer-tampering charges. A little over a year ago, the
former graduate student unleashed an electronic “worm,”
also referred to as a computer “virus,” that wiggled into a
federal computer network and caused millions of dollars
in down-time and damage. The worm shut down com-
puter systems nationwide, including some National
Aeronautics and Space Administration systems.

Morris is the first person to be convicted under the
Computer Fraud Act of 1986. He faces a possible sentence
of up to five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000.

Now, at first glance these penalties may sound a bit severe '

for a young, mischievous college student who committed
a nonviolent crime. After all, Morris may not have received

as harsh a sentence if he had raped and threatened to kill ~

NASA employees.

However, strict enforcement of this measure is impor- .

tant and necessary. The federal government must demon-
strate that it is serious about this matter. Morris committed
a federal offense that inflicted some temporary but
potentially very detrimental problems. His actions de-
served more than a misdemeanor requiring the proverbial
slap on the wrist. _

Let’s say, for instance, that some four-eyed, four-brained
computer whiz with 1500-plus SAT scores decides to
amuse himself some late night by unleashing a computer
worm on the computer systems of the Department of
Defense (which is highly possible) and hence shuts down
the systems responsible for the nation’s national security.
It would be rather humiliating, and worse yet, tragic, if the
computers which launch U.S. ICBM and ABM missiles in
defense of a Soviet attack couldn’t do so because their

systems had been shut down by some nerd’s computer

worm.

Five years in a rninimum-security prison —— of which
he’d probably serve about three —— is not too severe a
punishment for this crime.

If Morris’ prosecution and subsequent punishments are
fully carried out, they will probably be more to make an
example of the young man than anything else. Bu
perhaps that is necessary. '

Abortion: too involved in politics

This article is probably going
to upset a lot of pro-choicers, but
please bear with me. I do not
take a stand on the issue of
abortion. I am neither pro-life
nor pro-choice. My reasons for
this are both political and per-
sonal. Nevertheless, because of
my stand on abortion {or lack
thereof), I vowed never to write
an article on the issue. The events
of November 1989 surrounding
the Pennsylvania law on abor-
tion have caused me, however,
to address the issue.

Abortion has become too large
in America today. Granted, it is a
very important and signiﬁcant
issue, but it is so heavily weighted
in society in its sensitivity that it
is very harmful and dangerous.

Being as objective as I possibly
can, I truly believe that state
Representative Steven Freind’s
bill on abortion that became law
in November is a fair law. The bill
allows for abortions and estab-
lishes standards and requirements
that are not unreasonable. The
requirements that it establishes
were originally the following: 1)
An abortion cannot be received
on account of the sex of the
baby; 2) There is a 24-hour wait-
ing period between the times of
requesting and receiving an
abortion; 3) An abortion cannot
be received after the 25th week
of pregnancy; 4) The woman
must notify the father of the baby
that she is getting an abortion.
These are not unreasonably re-
strictive measures. However, in
response to this law, the pro-
choice groups in Pennsylvania
challenged it, and the state Su-
preme Court made changes in
the law. Points two and four
were eliminated. The original law
was a fair one, but once again the
issue of abortion has been com-
promised.

Sure, you might say that I feel
this way because I am a man.
That is a load of crap. It is an all-
purpose phrase thrown around
by women to explain those male
members of the population who
do not wholeheartedly agree with
them on abortion. Regardless of
whether or not certain factions of
our society are willing to ac-

knowledge it, abortion is a hu-
man issue, and not just a female
or male one. ‘
On a November episode of
“Pi_ttsburgh’s Talking” on WTAE
Channel 4, I watched a panel
discussion between several pro-
lifers, several pro-choicers, Freind
and Ann Devlin, the hostess of
the television show. What began
as a civil, intelligent discussion

 

degenerated to a personal battle
fought primarily between local
Democratic National Committee
member Jeanne Clarke and
Freind. Clarkewas melodramatic
and personally insulting. Freind
was able to carry on, or attempt to
carry on, a reasonable discussion
of his bill and abortion in the
midst of a barrage of criticism by
Clarke. I was not impressed by
her lack of professionalism.
Pro-lifers certainly have a ten-
dency to be far too radical in their
methods of protest. However,
personal attacks on either pro-
lifers or state legislators are a
poor way for pro-choicers to

_ defendtheir viewpoint.

Unfortunately, abortion is a
political issue in our country. In
theory, it probably should not be.
It is a humanity issue. Being that
it is political, we should not allow
this issue to be the single criteria
by which we judge our politi-
cians. Gov. Robert Casey may
well have lost his chance for re-
election in 1990 by following his
feelings about abortion. Pro-
choicers throughout Pennsylva-
nia, many of whom are Demo-
crats, have vowed to lead the
fight to defeat Casey next year.
These democrats may well vote
for Barbara Hafer, the Republi-
can candidate, simply because
she is pro-choice. They may well
disregard that she is probably not
qualified for the position at this
time in her political career.

In addition, many political
experts think that President Bush

may well have drastically hurt his
chances for re-election in 1992 as
well as those of Republican
members of Congress because of
their feelings about abortion. Bush
has not taken a firm stand on
abortion. The president has stated
that he is personally against it
with exceptions, but that he is
still not sure politically. This
uncertainty. and his personal
feelings have caused him to be
labeled “anti-abortion" or “pro-
life.”

‘No one issue should ever de-
cide an election, whether it be
the environment, education, the

, war on drugs or taxes. Abortion

is not worthy of such a vast
responsibility. No election on any
level in politics should be de-
cided purely on abortion.

Not only is this issue not wor-

thy of such lofty political value,
but it is also not a partisan issue.
Being a Democrat does not nec-
essarily mean a person is pro-
choice, and being a Republican
does not necessarily ’mean a
person is pro-life. This single
issue has the potential power to
completely change our political
process for elections and make it
not partisan or issue—oriented,
but rather based on one issue.
, The stand on abortion taken by
political figures in our nation
does not indicate the level of
ability of those individuals.

Pro-choicers have not lost the
battle over abortion as a result of
the Pennsylvania law or the
Supreme Court decision to give
states the power to make laws.
Abortion is still legal in America.
Roe vs. Wade has not been over-
turned.

All Americans have got to take
a step back and analyze and view
the issue of abortion as objec-
tively as as humanly possible.
This includes pro-lifers, pro-
choicers, women and men. This
issue has become far too volatile
and powerful in our society to-
day. Abortion must not be an
issue that will single-handedly
destroy America.

Pitt thumped again in the Big Ea

By Sean Heilman
and Ron Ledgard
The Pitt News

SYRACUSE, N.Y.— Itis tough
to handle any team when four
players must play the entire game.
Even tougher is doing it against
the 12th-ranked basketball team
in the nation.

But the Pitt Panthers found
themselves in that position last
night, and it cost them. The
Syracuse Orangemen pulled
away from a halftime tie to defeat
Pitt 85-74, before 30,023 in the
CarrierDome.

The Panthers substituted only
once in the first half, that for the
last 20 seconds of the period. But
with a 42-42 tie ath the
intermission, no one was
complaining.

But that playing time may have
taken its toll in the second half.
As Syracuse substituted, the
Panthers began to make mistakes.
Turnovers. Poor shot selection.
A crumbling interior defense.
The players denied that fatigue
was a problem.

“They just made a great run
[in the second halfl,” Panther
forward Bobby Martin said.

“I think we just picked it up
a notch [in the second halﬂ,”
reiterated Syracuse guard Tony
Scott. “The first half we weren’t

getting back [on defensel.”

“We did a good job back in
the zone in the second half,” said
Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim.

The loss dropped the Panthers
to 6-10 overall, 1-5 in the Big
East. Syracuse climbed to 14-3, 4-
3 in the conference.

Forward Brian Shorter led the
Panthers with 23 points and 11
rebounds while swingman Billy
Owens had 23 points and 10
boards for the Orangemen.

Both teams made runs at each
other in the first half, but neither
squad could get its running game
in gear. Both settled into a patient
ball-control game.

Pitt center Darren Morningstar
— starting in place of Rod Brookin,
who played for the first time
since dislocating his shoulder
nearly two weeks ago — put in a
good effort. He had ﬁve rebounds
and seven points and frustrated
the Syracuse defense in the first
half.

“Our centers, in the first half,
just didn’t rebound,” said
Boeheim. “Morningstar looked
like an All-American in the first
half.”

Billy Owens helped Syracuse
keep pace, shooting 7-for-7 in
the first half.

Syracuse went to a 2-3 zone
defense in the second half, forcing
Pitt to take its game to the

After an impressive first half, Pitt was unable to go the distance with Syracuse.

perimeter. The plan worked, as
missed shots and poor passes by
Pitt led to a Syracuse run.

A Derrick Coleman layup
and subsequent foul shot broke
a 56-56 tie and sent the Panthers
reeling.

Shortly after a Syracuse steal
led to a three-on-one break,

Stephen Thompson missed the
layup but Owens followed to
give Syracuse a six—point lead, 62-
56, with 12 minutes left.

“Our zone was good enough
to force them into shots they
didn’t want,” said Boeheim. “We
got the ball and were able to get
some fast breaks.

Pitt’s‘defense was not able to
handle Syracuse inside in the
second half. “Without Brookin
they only have to guard Martin,”
said Panther coach Paul Evans.

Syracuse put the lead to 75-
65 on a Thompson basket with
six minutes left.

The experts agree on Niners talent; disagree on outcome

Let me start by saying that San Francisco is the better team. The 49ers rolled through
the regular season with little difficulty and so far have made the playoffs look even
easier. They made a total mockery of the Minnesota Vikings’ No. 1 defense and then
took pity on the Los Angeles Rams by not making the score worse than 30-3.

But let me also say that the San Francisco 49ers won’t win Super Bowl XXIV.
Everyone says that they have so much at stake: repeating as champions, four Super
Bowl victories in a decade, being tagged the undisputed “team of the '80s,” covering
the monster 12-point spread. All the hype is going to the 49ers and Joe Montana. I’m

sick and tired of seeing red jerseys and blue eyes :

on the covers of The Sporting News and USA Today. *
Reporters, bookies and most fans already have a I
49er win scratched in. Fact is, most people thought 
the AFC playoffs were just a technicality to see who ‘

Is it really true that all the AFC-champion Denver Broncos have to look forward to
is another case of chronic Super Bowl humiliation? Are they really worthy to be 12-point
underdogs to the fantastic San Francisco 49ers on the Vegas line? Should Denver have,
as shameful a thought as it is, intentionally lost the 1989 AFC title game to Cleveland
to avoid further league ridicule, to preserve the battle cry “We’re a young team, so wait
until next year," ".0 avoid their third Super Bowl obituary in four years?

Look at it this way: if you happen to make first—time eye contact with the girl of your
dreams while you’re blowing your nose, are you
even a tad bit embarrassed? Do you wish you never
had that cold? Do you wish she would have given
you the eye yesterday when you were all spiffied
up for your mock interview with Pittsburgh Nipple
Works? Even to just have had a new tissue at the

DENVER VS. SAN FRANCISCO

San Fran would destroy.

All this is exactly why Denver will win. They
have nothing to lose. If they come up on the short
end of the score, so what? — it’s expected of them.
But Dan Reeves doesn’twant to lose anotbersuper

 

Bowl. So he’ll pull out all the stops. He can’t go

wrong here. He’ll call Flea-Flickers and reverses,
and why not? If they don’t work, he could just say he was trying to get something going
against the “unstoppable” 49ers.

George Seifert doesn’t have that luxury. If he tries a trick play, and it goes wrong,
what excuse does he have? His team is thought to be so good that he doesn’t have to
fool around. Reporters would be all over the first-year coach for calling an unconventional
Play‘ . . .

But the Broncos won’t just resort to trickery. John Elway will hit Vance Johnson on
simple pass routes. A near-healthy Bobby Humphrey will have plenty of four-, five- and
six-yard runs to peck away at the 49er defense. The Broncos will have their share of
time-consuming scoring drives. Don’t get me wrong; they won’t dominate San Fran’s
defense (no one can), but they will be effective against them. But they have to avoid
the costly turnover that the 49er defense is so adept at causing, which I think they will.

Now, to convince everybody that Denver's defense will shut down Montana, Rice,
Taylor, Craig and the rest of the San Francisco offense: well, honestly, they won’t. No
one has stopped them all year, and the Broncos won’t. But they will contain them. The

time?

The Broncs are in a heap of horse manure — 49
feet of it, to be exact.

“Hey, there isn’t any pressure on us,” said Denver
quarterback John Elway. “We have no chance to
win, remember,” he added facetiously.

Anytime a team feels that if its best chance to win is by having no chance to win,
somebody is due to turn red — beet red —— and make like an ostrich with the old head-
in-the-sand technique, i.e., upsets pop up like weeds in these conditions.

The best Denver head coach Dan Reeves, who twice before has slithered off Super
Bowl sidelines with his tail between his legs, can promise? “We’ll show up.”

Not exactly, “I guarantee it.”

Now what kind of championship do we have to look forward to when the coach of
the underdog team assures his men won’t be spending the day at King’s Dominion?

Other than in title, are we even dealing with a championship game here?

History says others like it have been played with quite surprising outcomes.

Pitt to grapple CSU

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team will attempt to even their 0-1 EWL
record tonight in Cleveland against the Cleveland State Vikings.
The Panthers, 3-?) overall, beat the Vikings last year, 27-17.

“I don’t know a whole lot about them, except that they beat
Boise State,” Coach Rande Stottlemyer said. The Panthers lost
to Boise State 24-12 on Jan. 6 at Fitzgerald Field House.

Stottlemyer does know, however, that the Vikings are
usually scrappy. “Cleveland State is always tough at home. We
are capable of beating them, and we’re looking forward to
wrestling them. /

“The [Pitt] team knows that league meets count double. We
are prepared for the challenge,” Stottlemyer said.

Stottlemyer noted that Cleveland State might not be as young
as the Panthers, but they did lose a few seniors from last year.
“Mike McKeon at 158 [pounds], Jim Lightner at 126 and
heavyweight Jeff Schmera should all be tough for Cleveland
State,” Stottlemyer said.

Simpson provides leadership

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team has
been struggling this season. When
a team is struggling, it usually
depends on the upperclassmen
to provide the leadership and
drive to get back on track.

This point has been stressed
by coach Rande Stottlemyer.

“In terms of effort and
performance, our upperclassman
obviously have to do a lot better
than what they’ve been doing if
we’re going to win,” Stottlemyer
said. However, Sophomore
Bobby Simpson has been
performing very well, and
consequently has been forced
into a leadership role.

“I think there is pressure on me
to provide leadership,” said
Simpson, the Panther starter at
126 pounds. “The pressure is
there in terms of hustling and
doing well. [Senior] Alan Utter is
our practice room motivator, and

This is evident by the type of
season Simpson is having. As of
Wednesday, he is 17-9 overall,
and an impressive 6-0 in dual
meet matches. “I’ve been
wrestling a lot better lately, and
I’m in better physical shape than
last year,” he said.

As a freshman, Simpson was
called upon to be an instant
contributor. He had a solid debut
season, compiling an 18-1 2 record
at 118 pounds.

Simpson said there are
advantages to wrestling at the

“The kids are a lot bigger at '

126, and I’m small for the weight
class. It’s been hard in terms of
strength, but good conditioning
has been to my advantage. I've
been able to try and wear them
out.

A “The kids at 118 are just as
quick, but quickness has been
my biggest advantage at 126,” he

said.

Simpson also noted that it has
helped that Stottlemyer wrestled
in his weight class. Stottlemyer
was a three-time A1l—American at
Pitt.

“It helps that he wrestled at the
lower weights,” Simpson said.
“The heavier weight classes
wrestle with a different style.
Coach Stottlemyer can help me
because he can relate to my style. "

Most recently, Simpson used
his style and speed to beat Lock
Haven’s Dan Smith. With two
seconds left and the score tied,
Simpson scored an escape to win
the match 4-3.

“We wrestled earlier in the year
at the Mattown Tournament in
Lock Haven and he beat me 6-5,
so I knew this was going to be a
tough match, ” Simpson said. After
the match, Stottlemyer praised
Simpson for his effort and
determination.

The Panthers will attempt to
even their EWL record (0-1)

tonight at Cleveland State. Even
though Pitt beat the Vikings last
year 27-17, there are no push-
overs in the EWL. 0

Pitt finished second in the EWL
Championships last season. “We
may not ﬁnish that high this year,
but we’re not going to quit. We
have a good reputation in the
EWL and we’re not going to give
it up,” Simpson said.

Pitt faces
challenges
in ski meet

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt ski-racing team

 encountered unseasonably warm

temperatures and lousy course
conditions en route to a fourth-
place men’s finish and a sixth-
place women’s ﬁnish this past
weekend at its first slalom

I competition of the season at
Tussey Mountain in State College,
Pa.

Sixteen colleges competed in
the National Collegiate Skiing
Association-sponsored race, of
which there will be five more,
including both slalom and giant
slalom.

Pitt’s Carl Skylling finished third,
and Panther‘ Karin Helm took
second to lead their respective
teams.

“The men’s team had good
racers this year, and we ’re looking
to be No. 1 and to qualify for the
regionals,” said co-president
Jeffrey Smith.

“Considering the team is only
two years old, that would be a
great accomplishment, ” he added.

It rained during the weekend,
making the course soft and rutty,
which resulted in sub-par times
by many racers. Pitt suffered a
few falls on the course which set
the team back.

Penn State’s Rick Cellich tore
up the course with a combined
time of 69:42, leading his closest

competitor by more than four .

seconds.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, January 24, 1990

San Francisco

Continued from page 7
crowd around me was saying
there was no way the Colts could
lose. By the second quarter, they
started quieting down. Then by
the third quarter, they really
weren’t too sure.

“By the fourth quarter, when it
was evident the Jets were going
win, I was saying to myself, ‘Yeah,
we can play with [the NFL]. Sure
we can!’”

In the very next year’s Super
Bowl, Dawson’s Chiefs had no
chance
Minnesota Vikings; a 13 and a 1/
2-point spread plainly spelled that
out. Unsurely enough, KC went
ahead and knocked the stuffing
out of the Vikes, 23-7.

So in 1990, the question is,
since the Broncos have absolutely
no chance, do they, in fact, have
a chance?

The first strike against them is
that they don’t play in the AFL;
they play in the AFC, and in
recent history, when AFC teams

Denver

in beating the NFL.

are supposed to get scrunched in
a Super Bowl, they follow suit
rather well.

Second strike against the
Broncos is that they aren't as
good as the 49ers, which is about
the best reason to presume they
have no chance.

Their offensive line is marginal
(Gerald Perry aside, who himself
is terrible). Their linebacking,
aside from All-Pro Karl
Mecklenberg, is mediocre. Their
defensive line was recently
shredded by a fullback named
Merril from Idaho State. Their
best running back, Bobby
Humphrey, has broken ribs and
will not even have the chance to
become a factor.

The 49ers are better in every
aspect.

Ball one is quarterback John
Elway, high and away.-Elway is a
future Hall of Famer. He is the
sole reason this team is in the
Super Bowl in the first place.
Elway wins football games, many

times in spectacular fashion. If
any player can do it single-
handedly, it’s him.

(However, the Reflective
Theory also applies here: Denver
is Elway; therefore, Elway is
Denver. In many cultures, this
would be considered a blatant
strike.)

The third (or fourth, depending
on how you keep score) strike:
The 1989 San Francisco 49ers are
being hailed as one of the greatest
teams of all time, right up there
with the Steelers of 1978, the
Dolphins of 1972 and the Packers
of 1966. The A.P.B. out on this
team says to look out for a red
and gold juggernaut, a massive
inexorable force or object that
crushes whatever is in its path.

Yep, that’s the 49ers all right.
Saw ‘em on TV last week.

The fourth strike —- no, this
isn't baseball; theoretically, you
can have as many strikes as you’d

like until the game is officially
played and over with before being
called out —- is “The One For The
Pinkie In ’89" motivation factor.
Joe Montana, Ronnie Lott, Mike

Wilson, Keena Turner and Eric '

Wright are the only remaining
‘Niners who will have played in
all four San Francisco Super
Bowls. They need this win to
solidify S.F.’s claim to being the
overall greatest team of all time.
Their motivation will trickle down
to the others on the team.

If you have any sense of
perception at all, you should be
able to sense a team on a mean
mission.

Do the Broncos have a chance?
They’re a decent football team.
They made it all the way to the
Super Bowl all by their lonesome.

I say they do.

But now that they have a chance
 San Francisco, 33-14. 1

Syracuse-

Continued from page 7

Only a pair of Jason Matthews
three-pointers kept Pitt close late
in the game.

Syracuse began to run and
was easily able to put on a show
for the crowd in the final minutes.

NOT ES: Derrick Coleman had
10 rebounds for the game, giving
him 605 for his career in the Big
East Conference. He is the all-
time leader in that category
displacing Georgetown’s Patrick
Ewing, who collected S97
rebounds in his career.
Freshman walk—on Brian Brush
saw time for the second
consecutive contest . . . Shorter,
Martin, Matthews and Darelle
Porter played all forty minutes of

the game . . . Porter set a personal ,

and Panther single game mark in
assists with 14. Porter leads the
Big East in assists . . . The Panthers
will take on the Arizona Wildcats
Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Civic
Arena. The Wildcats defeated Pitt

I 88-62 last season.

Continued from page 7
Montana-to-Rice connection and
the Montana-to-Taylor
connection have burned defenses
for the long touchdown play
countless times this season. That
little slant pattern that they do has
been unstoppable (not to mention
great for padding Montana’s stats).
They will run that slant but not
get touchdowns off them; the
Broncos will hold that play to 10-

I to 15-yard gains. Denver will not

allow San Fran the big play, and
will therefore force the 49ers to

F attempt more field goals than

they want.

Obviously the under-
confidence cracks that Reeves
and Elway are making aren't to
be taken to heart. Actually, I

think they love being the double-
digit underdogs; it keeps them
loose and worry-free. With all the
talk about the 49ers’ impressive
streaks, people seem to have
forgotten the dubious streaks the
Broncos could be on the verge
of. The Broncs have to love that.

If San Francisco wins, two
records will be tied. The 49ers
will tie the Steelers for the best
record in Super Bowl history at 4-
0, and Denver will tie the
Minnesota Vikings for the worst
record in Super Bowl history at 0-
4. The Vikings will continue to
hold their distinction alone.
