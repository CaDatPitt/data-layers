By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

Pitt sophomore Sam Kaufman was
elected president of the Resident Stu-
dent Association this week. Kaufman
defeated Jennifer Hitchings and will
replace outgoing President Evan
Levow. ’

Approximately 850 students voted in
the election, which took place Monday.
Tuesday and Wednesday. This figure
represents 20 percent of the 4,200 resi-
dent students at Pitt. “Turnout was ex-
cellent," Levow said.

“I hope we can enlarge RSA next
year and make it more interesting,”

said Kaufman, .announcing his plans for A

the organization. “I’d like to get us

started earlier, so more people know
what RSA is. When I first got here, I
didn't know what RSA was until
around October," he said.

The RSA is the representative
organization for the 4,200 students liv— .
ing in Pins 10 residence halls.

In the other returns, Holly Celio
defeated Larry Bradly and Howard
Fleischer in the vice—presidential race.
Jeff Carpenter and Beth Anne Gentile

going to bring to the RSA a sense of
enthusiasm. Through Sam. I can see
RSA becoming a’ major voice on cam-
pus.

State House Speaker

urges Pitt divestment  

By Shannon Smuts
Staff Writer

Pennsylvania House Speaker K.
Leroy Irvis spoke yesterday at a press
conference at Pitt on the need for
universities to divest of all holdings in
companies whichdo business in South
Africa.

The annual budget hearings at the
General Assembly in Harrisburg in
which colleges and universities request
the amount of money they want from
the state, are approaching. Irvis, who
sits on this assembly, will request that
Pitt divest from South Africa as a
prerequisite for obtaining the money it
seeks from the state budget.

In mid—February, Pitt’s board of
trustees maintained that Pitt would not
divest of its South African holdings.
Representative Irvis and various stu-
dent groups in opposition to Pitt’s in-
vestment are working to get the board
to change their opinion.

Irvis is approaching the board from
a moral point of view. “It’s not the
amount you invest,” he said. “but
rather the fact that you invest at all."

According to Irvis, this is a moral
issue. “It is right that black people

. should be free," said Irvis. “And it’s
stupid of white people to think that
blacks will fight among themselves.
They don’tneed white masters.”

The students at the press conference.
however, expressed an interest in ap-
proaching the board of trustees from

a business perspective. One memberiof

Some 250 miles from here, Congress
is awash in one of the most heated con-
frontations with the Reagan administra-
tion over foreign policy since the
Marines were deployed in Lebanon.
The issue this time is an administration

sponsored war against the Nicaraguan
government.

release its investment portfolio.

The students intend to show that Pitt
can divest at little or no financial loss
by formulating a new “South African-
Free” portfolio.

Irvis said he had recentlywspoken
with the trustees and felt they were in-
ﬂuenced by the idea that they might
lose money by divesting. Responding
to the students‘ questions, Irvis said,
“I will try to get those reports for you,
But if they’re only interested in mak-
ing money, why don’t they sell co-
caine? They’re not just doing this for
the money."

Encouraging students to press their
district representatives to support
divestment, Irvis offered the names,
addresses and phone numbers of Penn-
sylvania representatives. Each member
is up for re—election this year and, as
Irvis expressed, “would not want a
group of students against him.”

By convincing students from each
district to call their delegates and try
to change their views without blatantly
attacking their opinions, Irvis hopes to
get results.

Each delegate has a vote on the floor
of the General Assembly — 102 votes
out of 203 are necessary to pass any
motion, Irvis said. Citing the potential
for positive results through direct
pressure from students, Irvis stated that
he felt that students “ended the Viet-
nam War and drove a president out of
office.”

At a faculty assembly meeting on
Feb. 27, the assembly passed a resolu-
tion supporting divestment. This was
the first university senate body to sup-
port Pitt’s divestment.

Poe impersonator performs

By John Zaphyr

Assistant News Editor

Edgar Allan Poe is alive and well and
performing in the body of Conrad
Pomerleau.

Pomerleau, in a one man perform-
ance last night at the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room, brought the
revered poet back to life.

Pomerleau not only recited some of
Poe’s most popular works such as
“The Raven“ and “Bells.” but also
portrayed Poe as he would have been
seen a century ago.

“I do not just read the poetry,” said
Pomerleau. “But I try to give the im-
pression to my audiences that if they
were living in the 1840s or 1850s they
would want to see this show — thus the
idea of ‘Poe In Person’.”

Pomerleau, a gifted actor of stage
and screen who has appeared in such
films as “Amadeus,”“Kramer vs.
Kramer” and “The Amityville Hor-

. ror,” has been performing a§"iPoe for

nearly nine years. He began portray-
ing Poe because he was fascinated with
“ the man. v

“As an actor, I found his life very
interesting,” said Pomerleau. “And
characters are not interesting to do on
stage if they aren’t interesting people.”

Poe is bestknown as the master of
the macabre. His short stories of hor-
ror, “The Fall of the House of Usher”
and “The Red Masque of Death” to
name only a few, have gained him the
most recognition and fame, but it is
Poe’s humor that Pomerleau tried to
bring out in his performance.

“ I want to try to show the lighter
side of Poe,” said Pomerleau.
“Everyone knows about the dark side
of the man, the side that Hollywood
played up and actors like Vincent Price
made popular, but no one knows that
Poe had a very good and dry sense of
humor.”

‘Conrad Pomerleau bouh  Alan back to life last night

works. -- - --

Pomerleau also touched on some of
Poe’s past ~ remarking about his bouts
with drunkenness after his wife’s death
and his relationship with his foster
parents.

“I try to get into a lot of extraneous
dialogue while I am on stage,” said
Pomerleau. “I try to tell about Poe’s
life as Poe would have told it himself.”

Some of those that experienced the
performance were surprised at its

content.

“Lthought he was just going to read
from Poe’s.work,” said Linda Schwan-
benbauer, a Pitt junior. “I was
pleasantly surprised though, and I think
it was well-acted. I think his inﬂections

were what made the performance.” E

“I thought it was very good,” said
Rebecca Shultz, a Pitt student. “I
didn’t really know what to expect but
it was better than I expected.”

Breast cancer awareness pushed

By Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer

An 18-year-old college freshman
girl’s worries surround midterms,
dieting and guys. However, the thought
of breast cancer would probably not
enter her mind unless she noticed an
abnormality. One woman said, “I
never thought it would happen to me."

official to speak at Pitt

Meanwhile, here at Pitt, Nicaragua’s
Minister of Foreign Trade and Com-
merce Alejandro Martinez Cuenca,
will speak on the economic policies his
government has enacted to compensate
for a U.S. trade embargo which has
been in effect since Reagan took ofﬁce
in 1981.

The contrast is stark and the
simultaneous events are no doubt
related. “It is important to hear what
Martinez has to say,” said Prof. Jules
Lobel of Pitt’s law school, “because
it is important for someone to counter
the current disinformation campaign of

the Reagan administration.” Lobel was
a central figure in bringing Martinez
to the Pitt campus.

Much of the current debate in
Washington was initiated by ad-
ministration accusations last month that
the Nicaraguan government was im-
plementing an orchestrated plan to
sway American public opinion in their
favor. The plan, according to various
reports, is being carried out by a small
New York firm called Agendas Inter-
national, acting under the aegis of the
Nicaraguan government.

She was taking a bath when she
noticed a lump on her breast. “Right
away, I thought of sitting in a doctor’s
waiting room looking at all of the
brochures that they usually have. I saw
the ones on cancer and the frightening
thought of breast cancer entered my
mind,” she said. “I told my mother
and she insisted that I be examined. I
went alone to the doctor's office,
because I was so upset that I didn’t even
want my mom going with me. After the
doctor examined me, I was taken
directly to the hospital operating room
where my parents were waiting. I
didn’t care about the cancer at that
point, I just thought of my family and
my life.” The growth that she had was
removed and found not to be cancer,
but only tissue and muscle which had
formed a tumor.

In the United States, breast cancer is
the No. 1 form of cancer in women as
well as being the No. 2 killer of
women, according to the American
Cancer Society. One out of every 11
women in the United States will get
breast cancer. It is important to alert
the public to the existence of this deadly
disease and how to recognize it in its
early stage.

It is critical that breast lesions be
detected early, accurately diagnosed
and promptly treated, according to
Katherine L. Chipman and Idolia Cox
Collier, authors of “Breast Disorders”
in the book “Medical-Surgical Nurs-
ing: Assessment and Management of
Clinical Problems.” Only about 25
percent of breast cancer cases are
curable, primarily because they are
first seen by the clinician when the
disease has already become advanced.

The three methods of breast cancer
early detection include mammography,
a professional exam or breast self-
examination, according to Dr. Lisa
Begg Marino, assistant professor of
epidemiology at the Graduate School
of Public Health. »

Mammography is the technique of
X—raying the breast to determine ‘if
there are any cancerous growths. The
first mammogram should be obtained
by age 40, according to ACS guide-
lines. If there is a history of breast
disorders in the family, they recom-
mend screening at an earlier age.

The professional exam is ad-
ministered by a physician, and ‘accord-
ing to “Medical-Surgical Nursing,”

Reagan gets go- ahead on Contra money

WASHINGTON — After three re-
jections, President Reagan squeezed a
favorable vote from Congress on his
request for $100 million to back
Nicaraguan rebels. The House Armed
Services Committee approved the re-
quest after the Appropriations Commit-
tee voted no, the third House Commit-
tee to do so. The Armed Services Com-
mittee voted by voice, and Represen-
tative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado
said members “did not want to go on
the record" on the aid issue.

Palestine terrorists
foil assassination

Lebanon —~ The Palestinian terrorist
group headed by Abu Nidal says it
foiled a_ plot to kill three of its mem-
bers in Lebanon. The statement, pub-
lished in a Beirut newspaper, also
charged Jordan, Iraq and the PLO with
collaborating against Nidal by passing
information about the terrorist group
to other countries.

Soviet probe
photographs comet

— A Soviet space probe penetrated
Halley’s comet yesterday morning. The
Soviet Vega—1 space probe hurtled
through the dust surrounding Halley’s
Cornet to transmit man’s first view of
the nucleus of the famous celestial
visitor. Soviet and American scientists
at the space research institute in the
Soviet Union applauded as a nucleus,
estimated at only two to two and one
half miles across, burst into view on
their control room television screens.

After six years of planning, the mis-
sion came down to a tense 30-minute
dash from a distance of 60,000 miles
from the core. Racing toward Halley’s
Comet at 48 miles a second, the space
probe began encountering increasing
amounts of particles that could have
proved fatal, but scientists at the con-
trol room, and television viewers
across the Soviet Union watched as the
Vega-1 reached its nearest point to the

  

core with its instruments still working.
The computer image of Halley’s
Comet showed a yellow center sur-
rounded by a hard blue and then a
lighter purple halo. One color-en-
hanced photo showed a jagged—edged
blue mass with a greenish center sur-
rounded by a pinkish corona. In others,
the outer area of the egg-shaped mass
was blue, turning toward the center to
green, red and finally white. Scientists
said the colors indicated varying inten-
sity of light and perhaps greater mass
toward the center of the comet.

Soviet congress

MOSCOW ~ A shake—up occurred
at the close of the 10-day Soviet Com-

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
dumped two octogenarian non-voting
members of the ruling politburo and
promoted a series of associates. Among
them is Anatoly Dobrynin, the veteran

fled his homeland rather than kill
blacks protesting the apartheid policies
of the white-rule Pretoria government.
He arrived in the United States in
September and requested asylum.

Butler-Smith said his only contact

from immigration officials has been a
letter saying he can stay in the United
States while his case is pending. He
complained that Soviet bloc defectors
have often received asylum immediate-
ly, while he has not even received a

Pitt to
replace

steam
tunnels

_Construction will soon begin on a
$2.2 million project to replace aging
steam lines to.the Cathedral of Learn-
ing with a new steam tunnel. The tun-
nel. which will also provide steam heat
to Carnegie Institute. the newly ac-
quired Bellefield Annex and the Pitts-
burgh Board of Education Building.
will connect with an existing steam tun-
nel under the corner of Forbes and
Bellefield Avenues. From there it will
extend north along the west side of
Bellefield Avenue past Heinz Chapel.
where it will meet existing steam lines.
and then turn west until it connects with
the Cathedral of Learning.

Project coordinator Linda McGinnis
of the University of Pittsburgh’s
Physical Plant office said the existing
steam pipes were installed in 1934 and
had far outlived their original life ex-
pectancy of 25 years. The badly dete-
riorated steel pipes will be ‘replaced
with a 7—foot diameter concrete tunnel
that will have a life expectancy of 50
years.

While construction is under way.
much of the west side of Bellefield
Avenue and the Cathedral lawn from
the north side of Heinz Chapel to the
Cathedral of Learning will be dug up
as the concrete tunnel sections are put

begin March 10 and to be completed
by July.

The university receives its heat from
the Bellefield generating plant located
behind Carnegie Library. The plant
was built in 1907 to provide heat. light
and power to the library. In 1933. the
University of Pittsburgh. Carnegie In-
stitute. Carnegie Library and the

agreed to share ownership in the plant
for mutual benefit. Now it is owned
jointly by several Oakland institutions

portunity, Reagan, irritated by ques-
tions about Ferdinand Marcos. quiet-

was picked up on an open microphone.
Some reporters showed up this week

WASHINGTON — A Constitutional

Stern Outlook On Drugs

The drug problem in baseball is apparently
becoming quite serious, and baseball commis-
sioner Peter Ueberroth has taken prompt and
decisive action to resolve it. In order to deter
further drug abuse in professional baseball,
Mr. Ueberroth has dealt out some rather stern

penalties. Seven players implicated in the

federal drug investigation that took place in
Pittsburgh last year face the stiffest penalties.
They were given the option of accepting
suspension for one year or of paying a fine
of 10 percent of their 1986 salaries. In addi-
tion they were required to volunteer their ser-
vices to community drug rehabilitation centers.
Whether these harsh measures will prove ef-
fective deterrents against substance abuse re-
mains to be seen. But for those current and
future victims of drug addiction in baseball
Mr. Ueberroth has sent out a fearful message.
What can a player expect who now comes for-
ward and confesses his misdeeds? Will he get
the sought—after help? No, he can now expect
neither compassion nor treatment but rather
punishment and public embarassment.
From this quarter, it is feared that Mr.
Ueberroth’s decision will cow ballplayers
stricken with the curse of drug addiction.
Those who have fallen to this disease are vic-
tims, not criminals. It is only just that they be
given every opportunity for rehabilitation. As
it stands now, confession promises to be
punished in a manner most severe.

Crucial Role Of

Church In Poland

I am writing this letter in response
to Jack Burkman‘s article entitled "Is
Polish freedom alive?” (The Pitt News
Monday. March 3).

Mr. Burkman‘s assessment of last
Thursday's address by former National
Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski.
although accurate. seems. to be miss-
ing one important consideration: the
critically important role of the Roman
Catholic Church in contemporary
Poland.

Having had the opportunity to study
in Poland this past summer. I witnessed
first—hand the dramatic inﬂuence of the
church on everyday Polish life. The
church is where both cultural and
spiritual exercise takes place. The
church grounds are where well-known
actors who prefer not to work in state-
run companies perform to gathered
thousands. It is where Sunday mass. or
any mass for that matter. is so well at-
tended that only the old and sick sit in
the few available rows of seats —
everyone else must stand.

In political terms. the church
represems the only symbol of na-
tionalism in a country where the

government is viewed as a puppet of

the Kremlin. For without the church
and its unique position in Polish socie-
ty. the outlawed Solidarity movement
could 1101 operate. as it has been still

Swollen Glands

To John Picone:

Before I attack you personally, I am
compelled to comment on the fact that
the inclusion of such excreta as “The
Trouble With Asking Girls Out” (The
Pitt News. March 3) indicates a more
serious lack of publishable articles.
Since these two pages (Opinions) are
usually the only ones worthy of my
precious reading time. I would like to
see less of this morose rambling and

more polemic from the likes of Adam
Eiscnstat. -

Now, as to your opinion. Aside from
advertising the fact that you are a
borderline sociopath. your pitiful
ejaculate-stained ideas carom from
misogyny to bald sexism and back.
Perhaps some advice is in order:
Before you can ask a girl out. you have
to find out her name and make sure she
could pick you out of any police lineup
(after you date—rape her). Oh. and next
time you decide to include all males in
your masturbatory experiences ‘ — is
this the male bonding you spoke of? —
don’t. You’re not a loser. John. It's just
that your glands are so swollen they're
choking off the blood supply to your
brain.

Dear Sun. Thank you for being
so patient. In a place as short-
tempered as my planet. it‘s nice to
know how long you wait before
I erupting. It gives us some time to
l work some things out and even to
look elsewhere long before our
eviction notice. Yesterday morning
was beautiful. It was a day of
mourning for me because someone
dear to me died. The beautiful
morning reminded me of grace and
lightened the burden. I believe it
was also a reminder to write. to
give the report I'd been putting off
about the condition of life on this
planet that you warm. I‘m sorry to
tell you that the family of humans
has been burning down the house.

The most hostile pessimism
comes from our two largest govern-
mental bureaucracies: America and

the Soviet Union. This is because
the leaders of these countries are
still abusing their power. Mean-
while. I will tell you that worldwide
citizens of the world and the
academics in many universities
have been looking for solutions to
the problems of ecological ruin.
which still goes on and on. and
poverty. which has been healing
some places but worsening others.
Best estimates place the future
population as stabilizing under
auspicious circumstances at 7.5
billion people. under current trends
at l4 billion. Considering the liv-
ing standards being maintained but
not being spread quickly enough by
the bankrupt cosmopolitans in the
superpower countries. I‘m afraid
that the holocaust of neglect is go-
mg to continue. and perhaps
worsen. because education and sen-

sitivity are grossly undervalued by 
us humans. Although we pride 1
ourselves on qualities ranging from '
selﬁshness to altruism. very few in-
deed see that both oneself. others
and. most under-represented. the
future. depend entirely upon :1
healthy planet.

Humans cannot manage their
own house very well and are kill-
ing off millions of species. This has
been known for almost a decade.
yet not a single species bank has
emerged in the world anywhere.
Frankly. the me_n are too concerned
about getting laid and the Womcn
too preoccupied with politics I0
concern themselves with practical
considerations. I‘m afraid that it
looks very bleak right now. and yet
I hope for the best.

What Was Woodstock?

Alvin Lee is coming home. The Who
sound terrible.. but they play like they
really mean it. Jimi Hendrix is unbe-
lievably loud as his guitar screams and
bowls through “The Star-Spangled
Banner." Carlos Santana plays like his
very life depended on it. Joe Cocker
gets by with a little help from his
friends. Richie Havens pounds his
acoustic as his voice grates like sand
paper: "Freedom! Freedom!“ There's
no make-up here. This is Woodstock:
this is music.

Every time I watch the Woodstock
movie. I feel like I really should have
been there. And even though I was
barely walking when it actually hap-
pened. I feel a certain sense of iden-
tification with it. I grew up listening to
older rock music. and I identify with
the message of peace and the sound of
the extended jam — it means something
to me.

Let’s forget the thoughts of utopian

society. people living in peace for three
days. Forget the politics and labels of
Woodstock. just concentrate on the
music. When you get down to it. the
music was the main thing of Wood-
stock; that‘s what made it so great.

The people who attended Woodstock
tall 300.0()() of them) listened to
possibly the most awesome collection
of musicians in history. These were
performers who hadn't sold out yet.
and they played rock and roll. Santana
— before the radio dragged him into
the adult contemporary scene. Amaz-
ingly. they all had fun. No pretensions.
no reputations. just playing for a pur-
pose --- for peace. Whether or not you
think that playing music in the name
of peace helps peace along. it‘s still a
real nice thought.

Let‘s compare Woodstock to Live

- Aid. I.ive Aid had a purpose: to help

raise money to help the starving in
Africa. It sounded like it might be
another Woodstock when I first heard

about it; I really looked forward to it.
As I watched the show. I didn‘t feel like
I w as experiencing a rock festival.
After all. how can you watch MTV and
actually think you‘re seeing a rock
festival‘? The \'Js all look like they ‘re
trying to be Madonna. C‘mon. now.

At Woodstock. the bands came on
mostly stoned. but they didn't try to
hide it. They screwed up songs some-
times and they knew it. but they didn't
really’ seem to care. In fact. that added
something to the whole atmosphere *
a certain rawness. Rock and roll was
still the music of rebellion: it was raw.
sometimes obnoxious and always an
acquired taste. Back then. rock music
wasn't sugar-coated for mass consuinp—
tion -— most parents didn‘t like the
Stones. but nowadays. a lot think that
Duran Duran is cute. Isn't that nice‘?
Yeah. but it ain't rock and roll.

No wonder I had trouble getting in-
to Live Aid as I watched Duran Duran
plod lifelessly though their contrived

Washingt0nP0st Writers Group/Richard Cohen

"rock and roll" songs. Worst of all.
how can you have Madonna at a ruck
festiyall’ Instead of a rock celebra-
tion. Live Aid seemed more like a
Rock-Stars—Compete-For-the-Most-
Coverage show. There just wasn't any
sense of musical comraderie. What we
need is a rock festival without inake-
up — invite some hardcore bands.
some reggae bands. some garage rock
bands and George Harrison‘. we'll
leave out Loverboy. Bon Jovi and the
joke-rock crew.

After all this harping on Live Aid.
I have to make it clear that I am only
criticing the musical side. I think it’s
amazing and very noble that so much
money was raised through a pop music
festival. Live Aid‘s premises were very
positive. I commend Live Aid‘s organ-
izers; they had a higher purpose in
mind than Woodstock’s organizers did
(who just wanted to make money).

Still. I can’t help thinking that there
was no real feeling of peace or rock and

roll spirit at Live Aid. Even if
Woodstock’s peace was completely
chemically induced. what the hell’?
Peace is peace. And there is no deny-
ing that Woodstock was (and still is)
the rock and roll spirit incarnate. Live
Aid struck me as a huge advertising ex-
po. I felt like I was being used and
manipulated by the media. It had too
much acceptance to be a real. valid
statement against war. hunger. famine

- or whatever. What it did have in its
favor was results.

Still. Live Aid didn't have nearly the
emotional effect on me that watching
the Woodstock movie does. even after
seeing it 10 times. Seeing the Wood-
stock movie makes me feel like rebel-
ling again (though I only have myself
to rebel against now).

It‘s more than Ten Years After. but
the memory‘ still lives for some people.
Who in the hell is Alvin Lee anyway‘?
Havens knows. -

Deregulation Endangers Airline Safety

Aside from an inexplicable urge to
apply for the Journalist in Space pro-
gram. (I sat down until the feeling
passed.) there was never the slightest
chance I would ever rocket out of this
Earth to become weightless and bab-
ble Spacespeak — that clipped non-
language in which the death of seven
persons is being called an “anomaly. "
Given enough anomalies. you could
have World War III.

But I do ﬂy quite a bit. I used to do
it mostly’ for fun. now I do it almost
entirely for business. And I worry a lot
that I will descend in a ﬂaming anoma-
ly. So. I see the investigation into the
explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger as something that applies
not only to the space program but to
all air transportation. The witnesses

I chose TWA totally at random. I
could have chosen Eastern or Amer-
ican. United or Pan Am. In fact. I
could have chosen any of the airlines.
which. since deregulation. have been
cutting fares. hammering their
employees. offering bonus miles. All
this suggests in the process that safety
is not job one. Making a buck is.

Just recently. for instance. leaders of
the airline pilots union said that United
Airlines. the nation's largest. was cut-
ting costs by observing only minimal
safety standards. Maybe. Union
leaders. for bargaining purposes.
sometimes say things they can not
substantiate. United responded by
citing its safety record —— not a single

serious incident in I985. Similar
charges were leveled at Continental.
Western and Eastern Airlines. And
American Airlines paid a S15 million
fine to the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration in settlement of charges
that its maintenance program was not
up to snuff. It denied any violations.

The NASA investigation is. of
course. about the shuttle — the one that
goes into space. not the steerage class
one that scurries between Boston. New
York and Washington for Eastern
Airlines. But even on the nonprofit
space shuttle there were pressures. The
program was behind schedule. There
had been criticism. The president was
going to refer to the shuttle in his State
of the Union message. Morton Thiokol
Inc.. the maker of the rocket. was

negotiating a SI billion NASA con-
tract. A plucky and winning school-
teacher was being kept waiting.

No enterprise. no company‘. can ever
be totally shielded from financial
pressures —— nor. probably. should it
be. But deregulation has put enormous
pressure on U.S. airlines. Eastern. a

Texas Air to avoid bankruptcy. Con-
tinental went bust in one life.
reorganized and returned sans its old
unions. TWA is buying Ozark. and
mighty Pan Am. for decades an
American presence in the Pacific and
Manhattan. had to sell both its office
building and its once-storied routes to
the Orient. The curse of Darwin is
upon the airline industry: only the fit-
test are surviving.

There are many lessons to be drawn

Ruth said that it is hard for her to

She said that she did not paint the dark
shadows on "Liberty Avenue" to
represent gloominess or corruption.
The pedestrians’ lowered heads may
not be illustrative of inward feelings of
guilt. Ruth said that when she paints.
she does not consciously think about it,
she is just reproducing images in her

“It’s easier for me to deal with visual
images than to verbalize." she said. “I

Ruth’s mother Irma shares her spon-
taneity in painting. Born in Germany
in 1903. Irma Freeman immigrated to
the U.S. when she was 18. She was an
artist but had to raise a family while
in her 20s. Irma gave up her artwork
until Ruth was old enough to study at
the St. Joseph School of Fine Arts.

The two studied side by side, even
though Ruth was a teen—ager and her
mother was over 50. They both earned
a degree at St. Joseph’s, and Irma
followed her daughter to the Carnegie
Institute of Technology, where Ruth
had a scholarship in painting and
SCulDture.

The two formed a mentor relation-
ship with their instructor, the re-
knowned painter Samuel Rosenburg.
Ruth said that Rosenburg’s impres-
sionistic paintings inﬂuenced both her
and her mother's styles.

While lmia’s bold use of vibrant col-
or may make her paintings seem more
impressionistic than her daughter's.
Ruth said that she sometimes vents her
emotions on the canvas.

Home and Garden Showto feature expensive tastes

The sights and scents of spring will
arrive early for gardening enthusiasts
at the Pittsburgh Home & Garden
Show. March 14-23 at the David
Lawrence Convention Center
downtown.

An acre of elaborate landscaping in-
side the Convention Center is a popular
attraction at the annual event. Sur-
rounding this year’s model home,
“The Manor," will be thousands of
new and unique plants, ﬂowers, shrubs
and full-size trees. Begonias, primrose.
forsythia. azaleas, ﬂowering crabapple
trees and nearly a hundred other
varities will present an oasis of lavish
greenery.

The 1986 show gardens will be
created by D. Santoro Landscaping of
Allison Park. According to Dave San-
toro. the country-traditional styling of
the model home has inspired a land-
scape design resembling a wooded
area. “The setting will be spring in the
country," he said. “Show visitors will
stroll through our lush landscape sur-
rounded by leafy green trees and
masses of fragrant color. They'll cer-
tainly forget that it's still winter out-
side the Convention Center!"

A special feature amid the ﬂowering
gardens will be a rushing waterfall.
From a pool at its base, a babbling
brook meanders through the wooded
scene. Along its path are unusual new
varities of rhododendron and azaleas,
as well as fields of hyacinths and
daffodils.

Beyond the trees, yet another 1986
highlight will be the “Rainbow
Garden.” Thousands of tulips in full
bloom will be arranged in bands of col-

The same ﬁrm. in fact. is responsi-
ble for bringing Martinez to the United
States.

In response to accusations of an of-
ficial disinformation campaign, the
minister counselor of the Nicaraguan
Embassy told The New York Times, “It
only responds to our need to get our
viewpoint across."

That indeed seems to be the case with
Martinez’s presentation at Forbes
Quadrangle tonight. “The main objec-
tive in bringing Martinez here," said

Breast cancer

continued from page 17

“An annual examination by a profes-
sional is recommended for adult
females, especially after a person has
begun birth control. However, the fre-
quency of these exams should be deter-
mined by a clinician according to the
patient’s age and family history.”

However, the most important prac-
tice for women, according to the
“Medical-Surgical Nursing" book, is
the regular performance of proper
breast self-exams.

This procedure is most often taught
by doctors or nurses during a routine
physical exam. However. there are
several women's magazines and books
which also detail the technique. Here
at the university. a student can make
an appointment at Forbes Clinic for the
instruction on an individual basis or
receive the instruction as part of a
physical exam.

Even though there are these three
methods of detecting abnormalities ear-
ly. “[the proportion of] cases which are
diagnosed in the earlier stages are on-
ly changing slightly.“ said Dr. Lewis
Kuller, chairman and professor of
epidemiology at the Graduate School
of Public Health. One reason why more
cancers are not diagnosed early is that

the percentage of women using or hav-
ing knowledge about early detection
techniques is relatively low.

For instance. in 1979. the Office of
Cancer Communications reported on-
ly 19 percent of women had ever had
a mammogram. “The [problem is the]
whole component of ignorance," said
Marino. “People don‘t know the pro-
cedures [of detecting breast cancer] are
around."

Speciﬁcally. Marino emphasized the
importance of the breast self-exam.
“Women often do not perfomi the BSE
because of a lack of confidence in the
ability to detect the disease, lack of
knowledge or the anxiety of someday

or. forming a beautiful living rainbow.
At the end of the rainbow, a tranquil
garden patio is the setting for the world
debut of the Pittsburgh Tulip. Devel-
oped especially for the Pittsburgh
Home & Garden Show, this new
ﬂower has deep gold petals with a star-
burst black center. Never seen before
outside its breeding laboratory in
Holland, the Pittsburgh Tulip's
premiere appearance will also provide
an opportunity for show visitors to
select its ofﬂcial name. The public will
vote for one of eight names as diverse
as “The Allegheny Gold," “The Pride
of Pittsburgh" and “The Terrible
Tulip."

The most popular garden area at the
show each year has been expanded for
1986. The Competition Landscape
Gardens showcase the work of profes-
sional landscapers and allow the public
to vote for their favorite. This year
seven different gardens will vie for the
attention of show visitors, from a
shaded sunken patio to an oriental tea
garden.

For gardeners. plant lovers and
everyone else who loves ﬂowers, the
Green Thumb Theater offers con-
tinuous live presentations throughout
the shows 10 days. Area experts will
show and discuss landscape design.
ﬂower arranging. indoor plant care and
dozens of topics from bonsai to roses.
Of special interest will be programs
devoted to lawn care and rock gardens.

The 1986 Home & Garden Show
even has a few special surprises as part
of its 10-day preview of spring. On Fri-
day. March 14, the show will celebrate
its opening day by distributing

Art McDonald. a-Ph.D. candidate in
Pitt’s religious studies department. “is
to reach the establishment in the United
States." McDonald also played a key
role in bringing Martinez to Pitt.

Martinez’s credentials seem to speak
for McDonald‘s claim. Martinez holds
a Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt
University and a master’s degree in
economics from the University of
South Carolina.

McDonald said that Martinez has
been lecturing to organizations such as
the World Affairs Council and the

Press Club in Boston as part of his lec-
ture circuit in the United States.

“He’ll most likely be talking about
how the Nicaraguan economy func-
tions," McDonald said. “and the trade
relations they have sought with other
countries in an attempt to remain non-
aligned."

Martinez will speak tonight at 7:30
p.m. in IP56 Forbes Quadrangle. He
was brought to Pittsburgh by the
Religious Task Force on Central
America and invited to speak at Pitt by
the Center for Latin American Studies.

“These women must understand breast
cancer is not cured by ignoring it."

The main question being raised in the
medical community, said Kuller,‘ is:
“Once diagnosed, is there a cure?"

The ACS guidelines say, “There is
a general agreement that the earlier
breast cancers are detected and treated,
the greater likelihood that more women

will be cured."

Studies in the area of breast disorders
continue all over the world, including
among Pitt's faculty. However, said
Kuller, “Since the 1930s, there has
been no reduction, in the United States
or other countries, of breast cancer. In
this year alone, 123,000 new cases of
the disease will be reported in the
United States with 7.600 of those cases
being located in Pennsylvania.”

Pitt mascot created in 1908

When people think of Pitt. one im-
age immediately comes to mind: the
Pitt Panther. Splashed across shirts.
bumper stickers and notebooks. this
symbol represents the university and its
students. But how much do we really
know about the panther and its counter-
part the “Owl,” the former name for
our senior yearbook?

Digging into the Pitt archives. I
discovered that the panther was adopted
as a symbol in 1908 when Pitt moved
its campus from Allegheny to the
Schenley area. The new surroundings
and conditions of the school at that time
created a large amount of apathy
among students and faculty. To solve
the apathy problem a self—appointed
committee of alumni and students met
and determined that a school mascot

A was needed.

Dr. Cyril Wecht, noted pathologist
and authority on the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. will
discuss the assassination at Pitt on
Tuesday. March 11. at 7:30 p.m. in
David Lawrence Auditorium.

Wecht. the first non-governmental
pathologist permitted by the Kennedy
family to examine evidence of the
shooting on file at the National Ar-
chives, will discuss his theories con-
cerning the assassination. Wecht goes

their selection of a mascot was that it
must be distinct from the mascots of
other colleges and universities in the
area. and be a beast whose natural
habitat was western Pennsylvania. The
committee unanimously decided that
the panther represented the most for-
midable animal in Pennsylvania with
a unique fighting spirit and therefore
should be named as the official school

beyond the official answers surround-
ing the assassination and probes the in-
consistencies in the official version of
the Warren Commission Report.

Wecht's findings indicate that as many g

as four shots were fired during the
assassination.

Wecht’s presentation will be the first
of two events focusing attention on the
controversy which still surrounds the
Kennedy assassination. The second will
be the screening of the ﬁlm “Executive

mascot. Its coat represented the color
of the old gold of the school. and its
qualities of being noble. courageous.
strong and intelligent were represen-
tative of Pitt‘s alumni and students. The
first panther costume was made in
Denver from five Rocky Mountain
Panther pelts at a cost of $600.

A popular misconception about the
panther as a mascot has been that it was
chosen because of its association with
Panther Hollow and the four bronze
statues that guard the approach to the
bridge. The bronze statues were not
erected until three years after the pan-
ther made his first appearance as Pitt’s
official mascot and therefore did not in-
fluence the committee’s choice.

Why was the senior yearbook
formerly named the “Owl”? No one
knows for sure. The “Owl” yearbook,
dedicated to recording impressions and
details of senior—year life, was first

‘printed in 1907 and sold for $2.25. The

owl, which symbolizes wisdom and is
frequently portrayed wearing a mortar
board, represents our yearbook and
was published by the junior class until
1931. when the senior class took over
its publication.

While the Peace Corps is able to
utilize the skills of people with a wide
variety of backgrounds, Area Re-

said. college graduates with degrees in
certain scarce skill areas are most
needed. A volunteer with a degree in
nutrition might find work on a village
maternal and infant health project.
while graduates in the fields of biology
and botany might receive additional

Other degrees that are particularly
valuable overseas are agriculture.
engineering. mathematics. chemistry.

Many symphony orchestras operate,

in one way or another, over the course

of a whole year, necessitating the crea-

O tion of the music administrator. His job

entails selecting the season’s reper-

toire and scheduling the guest artists

and conductors. Bruce Carr, music ad-

A/\ ministrator for the Pittsburgh Sym-

phony, recently discussed the

/'\~/\ monumental task of putting a season
together.

Plans for a Pittsburgh Symphony
season begin more than three years in
advance by blocking out the 24-week
subscription series on a week-by-week
basis. An essential first step is know-
ing what weeks the music director or
principle conductor will be available to
the Pittsburgh Symphony, andwhat
weeks will be devoted to national or in-
ternational commitments.

Working within that framework, the
next step is to decide which major ar-
tists to invite, based upon either their
long absence from the Pittsburgh con-

cert circuit or audience demand.

The need to accommodate both the
opera and ballet into the season’s
schedule compounds the problem. It
is a factor that will be somewhat eased
by the opening of the Benedum
Center, the future home of both the
ballet and the opera. But even then,
the symphony does not want to split
the Pittsburgh audience between the
two houses.

“There’s no point,” explains Carr,
“in having Kiri Te Kanawa sing
Strauss songs at Heinz Hall the same
night that Sherrill Milnes is performing
with the opera at the Benedum
Center.”

heavy input from Marshal Turkin,

Down With Steve

This letter regards the review of
Falco’s “Rock Me Amadeus” by
Stephen Morrison. I don’t understand
how ‘you can call Falco a “sleazy
teutonic birdbrain” when you obviously
don’t know the first thing about him.
Falco is in fact a very (and I mean very)
talented musician, and even though he
has never achieved a lot of fame in
America, abroad his music has
brought him great success. I know
because l’ve been there.

I have been a fan of Falco’s since
the release of “Der Kommissar.” The
reason for this is because his music
contains distinctive characteristics of
its own. As for saying that Falco tries
“to cash in on the Mozart craze a year
late,’’ the fact is that the single “Rock
Me Amadeus” was on the top of the
Austrian music charts way back in

May-June of 1985.

i think that you, Mr. Morrison, should,

Attention: Stephen Morrison

l have enjoyed reading your column
since its first appearance in The Pitt
News, but you seem to have lost a lot
of your wit and common sense lately.
There are three main areas where the
deterioration of your reviews is most
evident.

First, your writing style has become
appalling and almost unbearable. To
refer to a singer as a “weird bimbo”

or to an artist’s fans as “numbsku|ls” '

is not only unprofessional, it is
downright unacceptable.

p.m. and Sunday at 6 and 8 p.m.
at the Fulton.

 

Second, as of late, you have been
making some uninformed critiques of
artists. In your Sex as a Weapon
review, for example, you chastised
Neil Geraldo for his writing of the song.
Unfortunately, Stephen, Neil had no
part in either the music or the lyrics of
that song. Errors such as this are an-
noying to your readers who know bet-
ter. It seems that you wrote this par-
ticular review with the sole intention of
degrading Neil Geraldo’s writing
abilities. Next time you decide to
criticize a songwriter or singer you
should make certain that they had
something to do with the song.

Third, you are too cynical. You

would be on probation were you a pro- '

fessor at this university because you
hand out far too many C's, D’s and F’s.
You should loosen up a little and try
to get a more optimistic outlook on life.
Please correct whatever difficulty it is
you are having in your life and cheer
up.

The Groveling Gourmand tastes Babylon

BABYLON RESTAURANT
239 Atwood Street

Pittsburgh (Oakland) Pa. 15217
682-9226 Tel.

Any restaurant that has a picture of
Pieter Bruegel’s “The Tower of Babel”
on the cover of their dinner menu
deserves at least one rating star,
before the food is tasted. But as one
proceeds into the business at hand —
eating the delicious home-cooked Mid-
eastern fare — more stars seem to be
in order.

Babylon’s food is heftily portioned,
home-cooked (even the pita bread and
desserts are made here) somewhat ex-
otic food, using unique ingredients
rarely used in American kitchens, like
bulgar, grape leaves, mashed chick-
peas, mint, yogurt, okra and kale.

Dinner prices are fairly inexpensive;
luncheon prices even more so. But
don't let the unfamiliarity scare you;
there’s plenty of items to satisfy the
palate of the less adventurous —
chicken, lamb, spinach pie, cheese
pie, steak — all done with a Syrian (the
owners are Syrian) touch. There are
even french fries for the gastronomical-
ly timid.

But our culinary consortium of critics
chose to go Syrian all the way, starting
with a cold appetizer called Maza, an

‘ array of Hommos Bithenee, Baba

Ganouge, Tabulee, M’Taume, feta
cheese and imported olives ($3.95). If
you have any difficulty understanding
the items, the English description is
printed on the menu for convenience.
The best thing about the platter was

that it could amply feed two people.
The next best thing was the taste.
M’Taume was a mixture of cold,
cooked dandelion greens, flavored
with a light touch of lemon, full of
flavor, not to mention vitamins.

The Hommos Bithenee is a concoc-

tion of mashed chickpeas, olive oil and
spices —— a smooth, tangy paste just
right for dipping the accompanying pita
bread.

The Tabulee was designed for fresh-
ing up the taste buds, being chopped
fresh parsley mixed with tomato,
bulgar, lemon, olive oil and spices.
Again, an item to spread over one’s
bread.

The Baba Ganouge was a stupen-
dous version of mashed eggplant
mixed with olive oil and spices.

Everything on the cold platter can be
ordered separately as an a la carte
item but with the Maza you can try a
variety of selections. The same holds

true for our next choice, the Assorted
Platter (4.95). This one is served hot
— thermal not spicy —- and is a medley
of stuffed cabbage, stuffed grape
leaves, “mushroom delicacy” and
Iubia.

The food is served on a large plat-
ter, again amply portioned.

What the owners call “mushroom
delicacy” was none other than gently
sauteed mushrooms embellished with
onions and undetermined spices.

The Iubia was fresh green beans (no
canned or frozen veggies here) mixed
with slivers of chicken and oozing with
butter.

The stuffed grape leaves were
almost pencil thin rolls filled with
ground lamb and rice. The leaves were
tender, only slightly bitter and flavored
with a light squeeze of lemon.

The stuffed cabbage were thinly
rolled cylinders of lean ground lamb
mixed with rice covered by a wrapping
of supple cabbage leaves, cooked in
a tomato sauce.

Flexibility in ordering is almost a
trademark of the restaurant. You can
order a plate of only one of your
favorite foods, a combination plate giv-
ing you a variety of choices or a din-
ner that includes a large salad or can
be built to include coffee and pastry.

If you’re feeling brave try the Kibbe
Nayee (1.95) — a small plate of raw
ground prime lamb, served with
spices, a touch of olive oil and raw
onion. This dish is guaranteed‘ to put

hair on your chest and an entry in your '

diary.
For our entrees, we tried the Baked

Chicken Dinner (6.95), two large legs
baked with lemon sauce and herbs,
served on a mound of rice pilaf (saffron
and pine nuts flavoring the rice). The
chicken was juicy and flavorful enough
but much too American-tasting for our
expectations.

The Shish-Ka-Bob (6.45) was a
skewer of marinated cubed lamb char-
coal broiled with green pepper, tomato,
onion and mushrooms. Again, it was
served on a plate of rice pilaf.

The Syrian Steak (6.25) was a large
patty of ground lean lamb (My guess
is that it weighed about 10 oz.) with
herbs and spices covered with a
tomato sauce. Rice came with the
dish. Try the steak only if you like your
meat highly seasoned.

All the dinners came with a salad of
iceberg lettuce and tomato covered
with an exceptional oil and lemon
dressing dusted with finely chopped
mint leaves.

If you still have room after the entree
we suggest that you try one of the
Baby|on’s three homemade desserts
— a Bakawa (ground walnuts baked in
filo dough covered with honey syrup),
Kanafa (ground nuts covered with
shredded wheat and honey syrup) and
an Almond Mamora. As I said before,
the pastries are made on the premises
and are delicious.

Anyone ordering dinner ($7
minimum) can receive a free dessert
simply by saying The Pitt News. This
offer is good thru March 31, 1986.

One further note, Babylon does
serve beer, wine and cocktails. Lunch
minimum is $5.

Blood and Cliche Carry the Day in The Hitcher

By Michael Fay

I guess the greatest accomplish-
ment of the modern horror film is that
it’s brought the thrills a little closer to
home. When successful, they’ve im-
planted all sorts of irrational fears into
our heads about a lot of very normal
things. Camping, babysitting, stopping
in very small towns or at remote road-
side motels, buying old houses and the
whole idea of hitchhiking have all
become very suspect in the wake of
these films. The idea is to play on our
fear of being singled out. To show that
one day your calm and complacent
world may turn on you. Perhaps some-
one you meet in passing at a party will
follow you home and kill you. lt’s not
likely, but it’s possible, and that’s why
these films often work.

Hitcher is very definitely in this
genre. Here, we have a kid, Jim Halsey
(C. Thomas Howell) who is driving
someone’s red Seville from Chicago to
San Diego, and a hitchhiker, John
Ryder (Rutger Hauer) who leaves
everyone but Jim’s body mangled
alongside the stretch of Texas
highway where the story takes place.

There are at least two ways in which
a film of this sort can be successful.
One has to do with story and/or
character development, and the other
with maintaining dramatic tension.
Hitcher falls short to a different degree
in both areas.

A coherent and ultimately believable

By Susan Washburn

A retrospective of potter Robert
Turner’s works is on exhibition at the
Carnegie Institute. The display
features approximately 40 works by
Turner tracing the artist's evolution
from making functional pottery to
creating ceremonial vessel forms.

‘‘It may take patience to come to an
understanding of these pots, for they
reveal themselves slowly, often better

story with well-defined human
characters is essential before you can
create a truly frightening movie. Au-

dience disbelief is, without doubt, the
quickest way to undermine the impact
of a horror film. Poorly developed
characters, especially, have been a
problem with many recent horror films,
probably beginning with Halloween.

privately, and indeed even out of the
corner of one’s eye,” warns Kenneth
Wesphal of the University of Wiscon-
sin at Madison. And, indeed, this is

_ true. For the most part, Turner’s work

consists of variations on the same
theme. He uses one basic shape and
varies the size and colors. The colors
range from white to black with various
shades in between. Other works are
done in brown hues. The names are
as common as the shape. One display

mysterious and cold-blooded. He

establishes a presence which is felt
strongly by the audience for at least
the first half of the movie; and then it
falls apart, as he is unable to draw the
audience in any further. Instead of
becoming more human, more realistic
and thus more threatening, he

Raw and Natural Pottery Appeal

Turner’s scratches and stamped im-
pressions give his pottery character.
“There is nothing accidental or ar-
bitrary in Turner’s pots, and yet there
is nothing in them that is forced or con-
trived,” according to Westphal. It is the
rawness and naturalness of Turner’s
work that gives it appeal. It is unfor-
tunate that there is not more variety of
shape to maintain the viewer's initial
interest.

becomes more shallow and predict-
able. At one point it is suggested that
Jim and Ryder have developed an
almost telepathic relationship. After be-
ing played with and released by Ryder
several times and witnessing over and
over his brutality, Jim appears, through
his manner, to have evolved into a dif-
ferent, more dominant character who
may even understand Ryder’s twisted
mind. Unfortunately, this is only sug-
gested and soon fades away in the
gore.

Aside from these shortcomings,
Hitcher almost makes it on a superficial
level. That is, the pacing and dramatic
tension maintained for much of the film
almost carries you through it, in a sort
of “thrills-a-minute” sense. There are
a lot of surprises and twists in the first
half of the film. Where and how Ryder
will appear next becomes somewhat of
an issue. Although these devices
aren’t very sophisticated, they do keep
you on edge for a while, until the film
finally gets out of hand. This occurs
when the filmmmaker opted out of do-
ing anything dangerous and settled for
creating a boy vs. killing machine
scenario. From this point on, the film
sinks quickly into a mire of blood and
guts.

Overall, this is not a very frightening
film but there are a couple of good
chases and fights and a lot of blood.
If you like that sort of thing, then Hitch-
er might be up your alley.

Pretty in Pink is Just the Cutest Love Story

By Lori Faiella

Sometimes when something
shouldn't happen it suddenly becomes
inevitable, as does the relationship be-
tween Andie and Blane in Pretty In
Pink.

Andie and Blane are different, quite
different. They are from opposite sides

of town. He is a “richy” and a

“square.” She is “poor trash” and in-
to new and wild things. Everything is
against them from the beginning. His
friends don’t approve of her and hers
don’t approve of him.

They meet formally through a com-
puter. He asks her out and after one
rather tragic date he pops the big
question, “Will you go to the prom?”
She accet.

What at first glance shows a suc-

I cessful artist’s visit to her parents’

home before they move out, goes on
to reveal the complex family landscape
of Painting Churches. Mags Church
does not merely paint her parents’ por-
trait, but replaces old impressions with
new realities stroke by stroke.

The basic story line is not anything
new or original but what embellishes
it — the music and the characters —
are enough to give it a spark. Because
it’s a John Hughes production, Pretty

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 

Playwrite Tina Howe renders the
Churches with a rich palette of
characteristics —— eccentric, senile,
daft, flightly, even poetic. Fanny and
Gardner Church, elderly and with
dwindling funds (“the money of the
Pultizer he won is gone”), prepare to
move from their Boston townhouse to
their vacation cottage on Cape Cod.
Their daughter Mags pays her yearly
visit — this time to paint their portraits

In Pink has a great soundtrack. From
the very first scene tunes like Otis Red-
ding’s “Try a Little Tenderness” and
“Pretty in Pink” by the Psychedelic
Furs pull you right in.

The actors in Pretty In Pink work well
together creating a comic montage of
amusing characters. Molly Ringwald
stars as Andie. She wears crazy
clothes which she makes herself,
drives an old pink car and hangs
around with a goof better known as the
“Duck Man.” Ringwald is good in the
part, and like her previous roles in The
Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles
she plays a young girl in the midst of
a teenage crisis. She is dramatic and
humorous.

Duckie (Jon Cryer) is the kind of guy
who talks four miles a minute throwing
off phrases like ‘‘I’m off like a dirty

while still in their old surroundings. But
there’s more than meets the eye.
She’s there not just to capture her
parents’ images on canvas, but to per-
suade them of .her talent, to gain their
approval. And in the process of paint-
ing, she faces some bitter truths about
them.

The play opens with Fanny Church

funky hats); she’s packing some fami-

shirt,” when he is about to leave. The
two of them grew up together and their
friendship, though it falters slightly dur-
ing the movie, proves to be
untouchable.

Blane (Andrew McCarthy) is the rich
boy who shows Andie that he isn’t
quite like the rest of his rude, pompous
friends. Steff (James Spader) is one
example; he is Blane’s best friend and
the biggest jerk. He is one of the ma-
jor problem causers for Andie and
Blane.

Pretty In Pink is a cute love story.
There areseveral touching parts in the
film like when Andie and her father
discuss their problems and scenes that
show the relationship that Andie and
Duckie have. it is not exactly a great
movie but it is a lot of fun to see and
you will probably enjoy it.

THE BLIND LEADING THE NAKED
Violent Femmes
Slash Records

I once had a friend describe the
music of Violent Femmes in the follow-
ing manner: “They have a folky sound,

only in a creepy sort of way.” Gordon '

Gano’s voice invariably conjures up
the image of an axe-wielding Jack
Nicholson during the final scene of The
Shining. At the same time, that voice
is one of the most expressive in-
struments you’ll ever hear emanating
from a slab of vinyl.

No recording artist has ever
depicted post-adolescent anxieties as
accurately as this Milwaukee trio did
on their 1983 debut. The soundtrack
to Gano’s confessions was a spare
and unique brand of acoustic power
popabilly that was expanded to include
banjos, fiddles and horns on 1984’s in-
triguing Hallowed Ground. As a result,
high expectations preceded the
release of their new album, The Blind
Leading the Naked. Unfortunately, on

Giving a damn
about the ugly  

LIVES IN THE BALANCE
Jackson Browne
Asylum Records

Jackson Browne was the pro-
totypical sensitive singer-songwriter of
the ’70s. But, by the turn of the
decade, he decided to trade in his
acoustic guitar, faded bell—bottoms and
sandals for an aqua blue leather jacket
and a much lighter lyrical approach
typified by the truly mindless
“Somebody’s Baby.” His latest album,
Lives in the Balance, could never
match the acute political insights of
Bruce Cockburn’s~Stealin Fire.

   

 

 

However, the man who Dave Marsh
has called “the most accomplished
lyricist of the ’70s,” displays more
commitment to his material than just
about any artist you can find on your
radio dial.

During the summer of 1985 when
most of the nation vacationed with their
2.5 kids in Myrtle Beach, Jackson
Browne spent several weeks in Cen-
tral America. The time he spent in that
war-ravaged region has filled him with
an anger which he has never vented
so spiritedly through his work. The
focus of his frustration on Lives in-the

Balance is the U.S. government’s con-
tinued support of oppressive Third

first listen, the disappointment l ex-
perienced was as if a good friend had
punched me in the stomach.

By no means is this a bad album. In
fact, several of the cuts here are
outstanding, as impassioned as earlier
Femmes classics such as “Add it Up”
and “Gone Daddy Gone.” The
number-one complaint against The

A Blind Leading the Naked is its complete

lack of continuity and consistency.

_ The album’s first single is a clumsy
remake of T. Rex’s “Children of the
Revolution.” The following track,
“Good Friend,” is one of the group’s
nifty Velvet Underground tributes,
complete with Gano’s now-perfected
Reedian inflections. There are con-
stant peaks and valleys of inspiration
throughout the album. “Faith” is a
gospel-blues which features an idiotic
“faith call” — /said “F”  “F”Isaid
“A”  “A” — as a sign of Gano’s
religious convictions. Then,
the Femmes blast us with “Breaking
Hearts,” which sounds like the group
has stumbled upon a great lost Buddy
Holly demo. The Blind Leading the

World governments in order to protect
American business interests.

Unlike Springsteen's “Born in the
U.S.A.,” no one could mistake his first
single, “For America,” as an attempt
at flag-waving. With this track, as well
as “Soldier of Plenty” and “Lives in
the Balance,” Browne implores this
nation’s leaders to wake up and ex-
amine their dying consciences. At
times, Browne appears insecure in his
role as a demagogue. There is a heavy
reliance on tired cliches, especially the
awkward references to our world as
“long on hunger and short on joy.” But
what allows the listener to be forgiving
is that even though Browne isn’t land-
ing all of his punches, he is still
swinging. .

Musically, Browne seems more
comfortable than he was on 1983’s
Lawyers in Love. His L.A. session
group plays tastefully as expected with
a slightly increased use of layered syn-
thesizers. Their sound is sharply
focused with the glaring exception be-
ing “Till I Go Down,” a miserably failed
attempt at reggae. For the longtime
Browne devotee, however, there is
more than enough to satisfy. ‘‘Black
and White” features an extremely
evocative slide guitar solo that is
reminiscent of Browne’s longtime part-
nership with David Lindley.

Lives in the Balance is a record of
great merit mainly because it proves
Jackson Browne gives a damn about
our often ugly world situation. There is
no worse sin than apathy, and he
knows it. Besides, as mainstream
albums go, Lives in the Balance is a
pretty good listen.

Who is he?

WHO AM I
Todd Sharp
MCA Records
Though Todd Sharp seems cast
from the same mold as, S8)’, F-'°h“

Naked is definitely a roller-coaster ride.

A piece of advice: Sit close to your
turntable while listening to The Blind
Leading the Naked, because you’ll
need to lift the ~needle frequently.
Violent Femmes have taken a sizable

Cougar Mellencamp, that may only be
mere trick of the light. Thanks to a face
that looks like it belongs on General
Hospital, he emerges instead as more
of a second-rate Rick Springfield.
Though he’s done notable work in the
past with artists like Hall and Oates,
Mick Fleetwood and Bob Welch, Who
Am I is_a debut album that falls short
of reaching the thanklessly mediocre
heights it aims for.

Sharp’s specialties (playing guitar
and songwriting) are not all that ap-
parent on Who Am I. His optimism as
a songwriter never quite balances out
with-his adventurousness; he's writing
songs that seem like they could have
been written by Springsteen at age 12.
And though his guitar crackles with fire
at times, it’s not at all distinguishable
against the exuberant, overly active,
rock ‘n’ roll arrangements. 

There is energy, though, on Who Am
I. The opening cut, ‘‘I Want Something
More,” bolts out of the starting gate
like a premium racehorse, and “Alone,
But Not Lonely” finds Sharp sounding
inspired and animated. But what’s
missing here is a sense of dynamics
and a sense of humor. The guitars are
busy, but they never sweat. And
though Sharp is human enough to find
faults in his own character, he never
wants to make fun of them. None of the
10 songs on Who Am I are the least bit
fun, most are, in tact, hauntingly
biographical. There’s nothing wrong
with that perspective, but it doesn’t cut
it.

Fleetwood Mac’s Christine Movie
chimes in here and there, but the prob-
lem with her background harmonies is
it’s hard to tell her deep, disciplined
voice from Sharp’s immediate,
Nashville-esque pop delivery. This is
especially evident on the duet “We
Were Lonely,” — one of the better cuts
— a sensible, heartfelt song about two
lovers playing while the spouse is
away. She was awful pretty/ So young
and volatile, Sharp sings, almost sar-
castically. I was loneIy/ She was lone-
/y/ So what else could we do? How
about a nice game of chess?

step backwards with this release.

That’s frustrating news, because the

loss still leaves them several steps,
ahead of their competition.

JOHN MCCOMBE

Perhaps if Todd Sharp releases a
second album, he’|l realize that finding
oneself amidst a whirlwind of rock ‘n’
roll cliches is not as important as find-
ing an audience. Even now he readily
admits, he’s just a rock ‘n’ roller from
Ohio. ‘‘I was a little cockier then, but
I haven't changed that much,” he said.
Really.

Strange Behavior

ANIMOTION
Strange Behavior
Polygram Records

Just when you thought it was safe
to bop back onto the dancefloor, along
comes Animotion’s sequel to their
debut album which boasted the
masterful Holly Knight song “Obses-
sion” and established the band as
tough competitors on the ‘dance
charts. Don ’t count on me/ I engineer/
On every move we make from here
sings Astrid Plane who shares leading
vocals with band member Bill
Wadhams on Animotion’s Strange
Behavior. Every move Animotion
makes from here on out is certainly
something to sing about since a hit like
“Obsession” is a tough act to follow.

But Strange Behavior is something
to cheer about; it finds Animotion in
daring form, tossing out style in for-
midable amounts. Consequently,
though the results are mostly promis-
ing, Animotion sometimes fall flat on
their faces, at least on senseless cuts
like “The Essence” and “One Step
Ahead.” Still, give them credit for tak-
ing chances and give them due
recognition for adopting producer
Richie Zito (Berlin, The Motels) who’s
a master puppeteer at pulling the prop-
er dance strings. After all, this is not
an easy album to make; Animotion is

a rock group singing tunes oriented for
the nightclubs without alienating the

pop crowd.

If you’re looking for another “Obses-
sion,” you will not find it. Songwriter
Holly Knight’s contribution is the non-
chalant “l Engineer.” What it lacks in
the promiscuous, one-on-one combat
a la “Obsession,” it makes up in in-
stantly catchy, sing-songish choruses.
lt’s not the best out from the album,
and not a wise choice for a first single.
It alsoproves that one of the unfor-
tunate consequences of Strange
Behavior is Astrid P|ane’s failure to
catch the ears of the listeners as a
scheming, teasing bitch, like she did
on “Obsession.”

But there is plenty to get the
adrenalin going on “Strange
Behavior.” The title out, along with
“Out of Control,” are likeable. The ar-
rangements on “Anxiety” propel an
otherwise mediocre song into dance
heaven, with Astrid Plane wrapping

~ her voice around a wonderful plead on

the opening cut, “l Want You” — I
can ’t concentrate/ You ‘re the only feel-
ing /can find. Plane can definitely sing;
the deepness in her voice on “Strange
Behavior” and her harmonies on
“Staring Down The Demons” certain-
ly attestto that. Still, her best material
—— a Madonna-like tune entitled
“Stranded” — isn’t given the pain and
power a more accomplished singer
may have achieved. If an Annie Len-
nox were given “Stranded,” one could
not help but think how the walls would
have vibrated.

Though Strange Behavior is an
above-average effort from Animotion,
the underlying problem is clear. What
the group does best ‘is mostly aban-
doned. Though the sounds on Strange

Behavior are cultured, confined and

revealed within their own boundaries
of talent, you cannot quite erase
“Obsession” from the mind. You are

A damn good
——frisbee

Artless should switch their name to
something more suitable, like
Musicless. They play, or perhaps I
should say bang, generic punk that
sounds as if it were recorded in an
aquarium, along with the fish and
water.

There are eight songs, all under a
minute, with lyrics as emblematic as
the music. Count on pathetic titles like
“How Much Punk Rock Do You Hear
in Russia,” and “We Want a Nuclear
War!”

Surprisingly, the band’s members
are mostly from good hardcore bands
from the past. Daryll was guitarist of
the Bad Brains, a reggae core alliance

from Washington, D.C. Gary Miller
played for  K_no_w., who wereﬁknown

for making speedcore fashionable in
East Los Angeles. And vocalist Mykel
Board is a writer for Maximum Rock
and Roll (America’s premiere hardcore
fanzine).

All in all, this punk found Artless’
failure to be a pretty lousy crack at
vinyl history, but a damn good frisbee.

songs. Drummer Matt Chaikin is
steady throughout but really kicks in-
to high gear on the pounding “The
Other World,” and Kevin Kipnis' bass
playing sparkles especially on
“Haunt.” Margaret Arana’s blipping
synthesizers highlight “The Vision And
The Voice,” while serving as more
subtle textuiring on other tracks. The in-
struments come together best on the
album-opening “Something Inside Me
Has Died;” Mata’s trebly, distorted
guitar blasts in on the chorus over the
humming keyboard and slick, buoyant
bass, punctuating his echoing words.

lt’s the lyrics to Kommunity FK’s
songs that cause problems. The
band’s vision is so dark and bleak that
one tires of so much overt pessimism.
The blackest words often come with
the most droning, heavy musical ac-
companiments, too. Worst are the
bland, distant “Junkies” (I’m so far
away/ There ’s no help left for me) and
the dull “They.”

Kommunity FK’s best compositions
have bright-sounding music that
almost betrays their lyrical gloom. The
major chord progression and simple,
airy keyboard of “Trollops” aid this
song about a mate with hair as black
as tires and a uniquely compelling sex
of its own. Despite the hopeful chorus
You and Eye will live forever in “You
and Eye” being shattered (You are a
child and I know /’ll never see you
again), it too compels. And the hard-
core/psych instrumental “Debauch-
ery” builds to a point where it rocks
almost joyously.

Close One Sad Eye certainly
showcases Kommunity FK as a tight,
aggressive musical outfit. And while
their sense of darkness sometimes
leads them down uninteresting paths,
more often their talent for creating in-
tense, affecting songs comes through.
Artfully avoiding mainstream rock
cliches, Kommunity FK proves that
there still is vitality and originality left
to be mined in America’s underground.

Building a New Season

managing director, and Lorin Maazel,
music advisor — also selects the
musical repertoire for the season. The
principle purpose of the symphony is
to construct a repertoire that provides
attractive, entertaining classical music
that will draw an audience. With this
in mind the Symphony Society ques-
tioned its audience to find out what
they preferred to hear.

“By far, the overwhelming
preference was for Beethoven, close-
ly followed by Mozart,” said Carr.
“Further down the line on a lower
preference level was the music of
Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Rachmaninoff
and Dvorak, and on a still lower level
came such composers as Debussy
and Haydn. Only a small but vocal
minority called for 20th century com-
posers.”

But other factors, besides audience
preference, go into forming the reper-
toire. One factor includes the
preferences and strengths of the guest
conductors and guest artists. For in-
stance, Paavo Berglund, the Finnish
conductor who is scheduled for two
weeks during the 86-87 season, has

of Sibelius was performed here in Pitts-
burgh just last season, it received a
low priority grade for the 86-87 season.
Tapiola, however, Sibelius’ last major
orchestral work, has never been done,
and so it was included in one of
Berglund’s two scheduled concert

programs.

Another of the symphony’s goals is
to attain an international balance be-
tween the British, Slavic, Italian,
Germano-Austrian and American com-
posers. A considerable effort goes in-
to flavoring the season with a

The Pittsburgh Symphony Society
recently announced its 1986-87
season during which it will celebrate a
triple anniversary — the 90th anniver-
sary of the Orchestra’s founding, the
60th continuous season of subscrip-
tion concerts and the 15th anniversary
of the opening of Heinz Hall.

Principal Guest Conductor and
Music Advisor, Lorin Maazel, will be on
on the podium for the Sept. 5 opening
night performance of both Beethoven’s
eighth. and ninth symphonies. The
renowned Mendelssohn choir of Pitts-

_ burgh will provide the choral finale to

the ninth symphony.

1986-87 season

Along with masterworks by some of
the world’s most beloved composers,
the season will be highlighted by two
world premieres, Violin Concerto by
Pulitzer Prize winning composer
Stephen Albert, commissioned by the
Pittsburgh Symphony Society for re-
tiring Concertmaster Fritz Siegal, and
Classical Variations on Colonial
Themes by Morton Gould, a work com-
missioned by the Post-Gazette to
celebrate the newspaper’s 200th an-
niversary. An American premiere, Arvo
Paert’s Symphony No 2, is also
scheduled. Of 14 guest conductors
scheduled, five will be making their
Pittsburgh debut. Of 33 soloists, 13 will
be appearing here for the first time.

tries. And not to be overlooked in
selecting the repertoire are the
strengths and preferences of the music
director. William Steinberg, for in-
stance, gave the symphony its strong
Germanic impetus, preferring the com-
positions of Mahler, Bruckner, Mozart
and Beethoven. Andre Previn, on the
other hand, favored Russian, French
and even American compositions.

Input from the guest artists and con-
ductors is given weighty consideration.
In fact, the Wvorinen Piano Concerto
— now included in the anniversary
season’s repertoire — was recom-
mended by guest conductor Michael
Tilson Thomas, who will lead the or-'
chestra in Garrick Oh|sson’s January
1987 performance. Both Thomas and
Ohlsson performed the piece together
elsewhere, and Thomas’ strong ad-
vocacy of the work led to its inclusion
on the program.

Balancing all these factors to weave
a season together seems to be a titanic
undertaking. Congratulations are in
order for Turkin, Maazel and Carr on
planning a stellar 1986-87 anniversary
program that promises to give Pitts-
burghers a truly memorable and
outstanding concert series.

By Stephen Morrison

The first robin of spring has
been killed by a BB gun. I saw
it happen. I cried. Then I thought,
“Oh hell, I’/I just go to Miami.
That’s where the poor damn bird
should have stayed to begin
wit 

In Florida, naturally, I was shot
at by drug smugglers and an in-
coherent Don Johnson. I re-
turned home, defeated but
enriched. On the flight back I
listened to some new tunes, and
here are the reviews.

Topper Headon: ‘Leave it to Luck

Shortly after completion of Combat
Rock, The Clash’s underrated last hur-
rah, drummer Topper Headon left the
band due to “ideological differences.”
Everyone assumed, naturally, that he
had been fired, that he had grown tired
of the lifestyle or something of the sort.

Guitarist/songwriter Mick Jones left

‘The Clash a year later, effectively end-

ing the band as we knew it, and went
on to form the uninspired state-of—the-
boring-techno-art Big Audio Dynamite.
Meanwhile Joe Strummer (whom I and
many others had considered the
original Clash’s heart and soul) got
together a new band that he insists
upon calling The Clash — we know
better — whose music is mostly uncut
crap. Seems that Headon got out just
in the nick of time.

And what of Headon? Funny that
you should ask. He’s emerged with an
album that is not only better than
anything Strummer‘ or Jones have
done infour years, but its first single
is one of the freshest things anybody’s
released in ages. This in itself is not ex-
actly a bolt out of the blue — it was
Headon, remember, who wrote some
of The Clash’s most delightfully quirky
numbers (“Rock the Casbah,” “lvan
Meets GI Joe”) —— but what is in-

   
_ _ - — . - —
   

teresting is the musical medium he’s
embraced. It isn’t punk, it isn’t heavy
rock, it isn’t even rock at all, really: lt’s
straight up, four-on-the-floor, drink-
your-damn-beer R&B, and it’s terrific.
What a pleasant surprise.

Heart: These Dreams

That Heart, after 11 years, have now
hit it big might be a touching rags-to-.
riches story, were it not for the fact that
they have always been such a God-
damn sleazy band. (Scary people,

" these Wilson sisters: involvement with .

the Reverend Moon? Before that, the
Manson Family? I’m not pointing any
fingers, mind ...) Still, they do sound
better than ever before. Of course, you
have to clean up your act if you want
hits, and Heart sure want hits. Well,
'they’ve got ‘em now. Way to go,
America.

Siouxsie and the Banshees:
Candyman

lt’s probably doomed to obscurity,
but this hypnotic follow-up to the an-
noying “Cities in Dust” is one of the
best things this band has recorded to
date. Propelled by a really cool (can’t
think of a better word, sorry) guitar line
and featuring an otherworldly melody
that somehow makes Miss Sioux
sound exactly like The Pretenders’
Christine Kerr, “Candyman” is a
distillation of everything good about
the Banshees without any sign of the

many elements that usually conspire ’

to make them obnoxious and unlisten-
able. ln fact, it’s the one thing I've ever
heard them do that I sincerely like.
Perhaps after nearly a decade
together, Siouxsie and the Banshees
have finally found their sound. It would
be nice to think so.

Public Image Ltd: Rise

What’s this? John Lydon singing? A
melody? And then  a harmony? This
isn’t the Public Image we know,
surely?

Yes, it is, and it isn’t so shocking, ac-
tually —-— PIL have never been strang-
ers to melody. Even the grating “This
is Not a Love Song” was more musical
than it seemed on the surface. For all
their lip service to “minimalism”
(whatever that is), PlL are accom-
plished musicians whose songs are
buoyed by 30 years of changing styles,
revolution and evolution: They are as
thoroughly modern as any band now
recording, but don’t believe everything
John Lydon may claim (or disclaim) in
interviews. He knows exactly what he’s
doing, and although he might not tell
you, he likes doing it. Care to know
where rock music is in the spring of

1986? Give this a listen.

Simple Minds: All the Things She Said

“Sanctify Yourself” is a fine song,
but if you were thinking of buying it,
don’t. in an ideal scenario, you would
buy the album (Once Upon a Time,
A&M), which consists of eight uniform-
ly excellent songs; but if it is a single
you must have, this is the one. Here
you’ll find some of Scotland’s favorite
sons in peak form, effortlessly weav-
ing chesty vocal lines, guitar and syn-
thesizers in and out of a mesmerizing
superstructure of sound that leaves
you breathless. Don’t mistake Simple
Minds, now that they’ve achieved long-
overdue popularity, for just another
Top 40 factory. They have much more
to offer.

Violent Femmes: Children of the
Revolution

The Violent Femmes may be the
greatest band in the history of
American music. That is not hype. it is

 

   

my considered opinion. Then again,
they may be just another eccentric
group of musicians whose idiosyn-
cracies are easily mistaken for genius.
lt’s difficult to say.

I tend to think that there is some
truth in both statements. Their first two
records, especially their debut, com-
pare favorably with “classic” albums,
music that has withstood the test of
time, such as Bob Dylan’s mid-’60s
period. The Femmes, if nothing else,
are completely original; that at least is
clear. Their new LP, or what l’ve heard
of it so far, seems to be consistent in
quality with their other records: It com-
bines rock, country and gospel with a
claustrophobic angst that is at once
compelling and irritating; both brilliant
and banal. “Children of the Revolu-
tion” (not written, incidentally, by one
of the three core Femmes) is a very
good song, a progression in the band’s
sound and so on  but it makes me
uneasy. Do I really like it? I think I do.
Then again, everything this band has
ever done has made me uneasy, and
l’ve never liked any of their stuff right
away. Of course, l always seem to
grow to love it. I think my overall feel-
ings about the Femmes can be con-
densed into this statement, take it or
leave it: Their songs are the aural
equivalent of Flannery O’Connor’s
short stories —— simple on the surface,
arrogant, infuriating, often frightening
and utterly, utterly American; and
whether or not you like them, they
leave an indelible impression. A

l’ve told my secretary to hold all calls
for the next few months. l’ll be locked
away, listening to the new Femmes
album, trying to figure it out.

designer original. \

They bicker like children. Gardner
puts his robe on over his clothes and
shuffles around the living room drop-
ping pages of his manuscript. Fanny
flits from couch to china closet, packs
a tray and drops it into a box.

Loaded with easel and backpack,
Mags arrives and begins to set up
shop while under fire from her mother
for dying her hair. Her father tries to

‘smooth things over by paying Mags

absent-minded compliments.
As all three prepare for the painting
sessions, they reminisce about the

past. Mags recalls painful childhood -

experiences. Ironically, she stuffs
herself with food after remembering

how her mother had “banished her
from the dinner table for six months.”

Fanny adds a zany story of herself
and her husband sledding down
Beacon Hill and Gardner’s mind trails
off into lines from a Wallace Stevens
poem. The family profile takes shape
along with the portrait. '

Denise Huot renders a harshly nut-
ty Fanny under Marc Masterson’s
direction. Near the end of the play,
when Tina Howe gets to the core of
Fanny Church, this cacophonous por-
trayal begins to make sense. When a
horrified Mags accuses her mother of
cruelty for mocking her father, she
discovers a new dimension in her —
Fanny rummages around thrift shops
to hide from her loneliness; she plays

 

silly games with her husband, because
that’s the only way to touch base with
him.

Masterson, who’d once seen Mags
played as a wooden character, pre-
ferred a more emphatic style for this
production. Under his direction, Kelly
Maurer plays a forceful Mags. Unfor-

 

tunately, often the appropriate emotion
for some of the most poignant lines
was lost. But when Mags pleadingly
tried to convince her parents of her
abilities, when she cried out in defense
of her father, Maurer shone —- she
captured her audience.

Bingo O’Ma|ley’s shuffling,
disoriented Gardner drew lots of
chuckles; no pity. Gardner’s state of
mind makes him childlike, oblivious to
the sharper edges of life. And that’s
how O’Mal‘ley portrayed him.

Painting Churches runs atthe New
City Theater, Bouquet and Sennott ,
through March 29. Performances are

‘Panthers fall short at buzzer

The Pitt News. March 7‘. 1986

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

NEW YORK — Pitt‘s hopes for an
4‘-NCAA bid expired yesterday when the
Panthers suffered a heartbreaking
57-56 loss to the Georgetown Hoyas in
the first round of the Big East tourna-
ment at Madison Square Garden.

Demetreus Gore's desperation
jumper was blocked by Ralph Dalton
as time expired, and the Panthers,
perhaps, closed the season with a 15-13
record.

Pitt had their chances to win, but it
seemed that it was not meant to be.
Trailing 57-56 with 27 seconds remain-
ing. the Panthers worked for a poten-
tial game—winning last shot. Gore drove
the lane. was bumped, spun and threw

1‘. _;A desperation shot in the air. Air was
all he hit; the official made no call.

Georgetown’s David Wingate cap-
tured the ball and was fouled by Pitt’s
Jerome Lane with six seconds remain-
ing on the clock. Wingate. usually one
of Georgetown's steadiest players.
went to the foul line and missed the
front end of a one—and-one.

Charles Smith rebounded and kicked
it out to Curtis Aiken. who pushed it
Lip court while dodging a roll of toilet
paper simultaneously. Controversy
ensued as the clock was stopped to rid
the floor of the toilet paper. Two
seconds showed on the clock. and the
officials ruled it should remain so. Pitt
head coach Roy Chipman was livid.

“I thought there should have been
four seconds on the clock,” Chipman
said.

“The clock is stopped as soon as
there is interference on the shooter,"
officiating crew chief Dick Paparo add-
ed. “We had definite knowledge that
there were two seconds left on the
clock when [interference] happened.”

Regardless of the outcome, it was a
gutsy showing by the Panthers. Pitt
proved that it had more than recovered
from the 93-62 loss it suffered last
Saturday at Georgetown.

Chipman started a smaller, quicker
lineup with Lane at power forward and
Smith at center. The change paid off.

“We did exactly what we wanted
to,” Chipman said.

Officials not  

Keith Armstrong hits
Georgetown.

Indeed they did. The Panthers
jumped out to an early five-point lead
of 30-25 with four minutes to go in the

first half. It was short-lived. however. '

 the I-loyas stormed back and took a
38-34 lead into the locker room at
halftime. Reggie Williams’ 10 first-half
points sparked the Hoyas.

Pitt was handcuffed by the end of the
ﬁrst half by an injury to Joey David and
by foul trouble to Gore. Chipman went
with the same five players through
much of the first half.

“We lost Joey David in the first half
and got into some foul trouble with
Demetreus and Keith Armstrong,”
Chipman said. “But we stuck
together.”

Georgetown came out firing early in
the second half. Williams and Wingate
hit four long jumpers in a row as the
Hoyas lead increased to sixsat 46-40
with 15:45 remaining.

The Panthers climbed back behind
the play of Lane and Aiken until they
led 53-50 with 6:40 left in the game.

Both teams traded misses time and
again as the clock wound down. The
Hoyas finally took the lead for good
with Perry McDonald's three-point
play at 2:19. bringing the score to
55-53. Ralph Dalton added a layup for
Georgetown to finish the Hoya scoring.

David came off the bench to shoot
a free throw for an injured Lane. cut-
ting the Georgetown lead to three.
Then Lane came back to add two foul
shots, ending the scoring.

That set the stage for Gore‘s two
misses in the final minute.

“We wanted to get the ball inside to
Demetreus,” Chipman said. “He’s
strong inside, and he‘s our best free
throw shooter. He got bumped on both
shots, but there was no call.”

The Panthers were led by Aiken’s 12
points. Smith added 11 points and nine
rebounds, while Armstrong had 11
points off the bench. The freshman
Lane pumped in eight points, grabbed
nine rebounds and had five steals.
Williams paced Georgetown with 16
points.

The hopes of a NIT bid still exist for
Pitt. Chipman hinted that a bid would
be accepted should it be extended.

“I don‘t think there are 90 teams in

I the nation better than us," Chipman

said.

only cause for loss

NEW: YORK —— Anyone who
watched Thursday aftemoon’s Big East

tournament first—round matchup be— H

tween Pitt and Georgetown can
reasonably believe that perhaps the
Panthers were robbed of a victory. Not
once, not twice but three times the of-
ficials — Dick Paparo and Fred Hikel
and Tim Higgins — made controver-

sial calls that went Georgetown’s way.

Demetreus Gore may have been
bumped when he drove to the basket
with nine seconds remaining in the
game and Pitt trailing 57-56. There was
no call made and Georgetown gained
control of the ball.

Maybe there should have been two
seconds placed back on the clock after
a roll of toilet paper was thrown on the
court as Curtis Aiken pushed the ball
up the floor in the final seconds of the
game. Time was not placed back on the
clock and Pitt was forced to hurry their
potential game-winning last shot.

Finally, maybe Gore was hacked on
his final desperation shot as time ex-
pired. Again. no call was made, and
the Panthers lost to Georgetown 57-56.

To say everybody on the Pitt bench
looked at the three officials with disgust
would be an understatement. Assistant
coach John Calipari rushed onto the
floor as the horn sounded at the end of
the game to protest the officiating.

Well, the officiating may have had
a hand in the Pitt loss, but there were
a few other important factors worth

‘ noting. With the margin of defeat be—

ing only one point, it is easy to pick
out factors that contributed to the loss.

The big one that comes to mind is
the breakaway half—dunk, half—layup
that Jerome Lane missed in the first
half. Lane had clear sailing, but seemed
to get stuck in mid—air and consequently
missed the shot. If he dunked that ball,
like he had so many other times this
year, perhaps the final score would be
58-57 Pitt.

Jim Urban

1 Another factor tnat comes to mind is
the four traveling calls on Gore.

Georgetown capitalized on two of
those turnovers — that‘s a four—point
swing in the final score.

Another factor is the seven foul shots
that Pitt missed. Charles Smith missed
three and Curtis Aiken two. Aiken’s
misses came late in the second half
when the game was on the line.

I don’t want to dwell on the

negatives, because Pitt played a fine
basketball game for the first time in
weeks, so I will leave it at that. Yester-

day’s game was typical of the entire  —

season of the Pitt basketball team — so
close but yet so far.

“We didn’t have a good season,”
Pitt head coach Roy Chipman said.
“This was a chance to redeem
ourselves.”

The Panthers came close to total
redemption, but this game, like others
in the past, slipped through Pitt’s
fingers. The Panthers proved that they
have talent and that they can play with
anyone. But once again, they proved
they can’t win the close game.

The mark of a good team is the team
that wins the one-point ball games. The
Panthers are young and somewhat in-
experienced. Perhaps that accounts for
how they somehow find a way to lose
the close games. M

So right now, the Panthers can won'y
about doing the little things like mak-
ing the free throws, converting the
layups and minimizing the turnovers,
instead of worrying about the
officiating.

It may have seemed like the Panthers
lost -yesterday’s game in the final
minute, but they really lost it in the ﬁrst
half.

Some thoughts on Pittsburgh sports

By Jim Pietras
Assistant Sports Editor

Here are some thoughts on a snowy
afternoon in Pittsburgh:

Mike Gottfried, Pitt’s new head foot-
ball coach, deserves to be commend-
ed for his open call for walk-ons. A
move such as this not only generates
better student involvement in the pro-
gram, but also allows Pitt to be able to
get its own bunch of crazies on the
field. in the same manner as the kickoff
team does down at Texas A&M under
former Pitt mentor Jackie Sherrill.

The current search to replace Dr.
Roy Chipman as head basketball coach
has drawn an interesting mix of names
such as George Karl, the current
Cleveland Cavaliers coach. I think
another Pittsburgh native deserves

some attention, however. What about
Connie Hawkins? Anybody who has
done as much for the city of Pittsburgh
and basketball should at least get some
mention.

Anybody who watches the National
Hockey League should give their vote
to Mario Lemieux for Most Valuable
Player. Nobody has done as much for
a team in such a short span as he has,
not even the Great One. The Penguins
would not be half the team they cur-
rently are without Lemieux. Not even
the Edmonton Oilers can say that about
Wayne Gretzky. Sure, Gretzky is
valuable. but Lemieux is undoubtedly
the most valuable.

One of the few bright spots in an
otherwise thoroughly mediocre season
for the Panthers has been the much-
improved play of Demetreus Gore." The

_ sophomore guard from Michigan is in

  MlRl\lOFF ’

~:N"COMEDlAN E

the top 10 in the three Big East
categories: average, ﬁeld goal percen—
tage and free throw percentage. His
play is such a drastic change from last
year that he deserves to be the team’s
most improved player, with Curtis
Aiken coming in a close second.

Pitt’s tennis coach, George Dieffen—
bach, hit the nail on the head when he
said that the Panther tennis team needs
an indoor facility to ever be com-
petitive. Anybody who has ever played
at Trees Courts knows what he is talk—
ing about. Unfortunately, tennis is not
considered to be worthy of such a
healthy expenditure. Maybe a few
Golden Panthers could come to his
rescue.

The most dominating athlete on Pitt‘s
campus this year is Lee McRae. Every
weekend he goes against the best this
nation has to offer, and he shows them

what he is made of. His performances
pretty much guarantee that Pitt will
have a representative at the 1988 Sum’
mer Games in Seoul. Korea.

Women’s head coach Kirk Bruce,
despite this year’s 11-16 record, is
what that program needs to be suc—
cessful. Thrown in at a very tough
time, Bruce has shown his class in the
handling ofthe current season. If he is
able to have a strong recruiting year.
next season will be quite a different
story.

Former Pitt offensive lineman Bill
Fralic and Jimbo Covert will join
William "The Refrigerator“ Perry and
Ed “Too Tall" Jones in the ring for
a 20—man Battle Royale during Wrestle-
mania II. I don’t care how fake pro

‘Ueberroth making right moves

to the

With his decision about the players
in last year’s drug trials, Peter Ueber-
roth has revealed himself to be the best
commissioner in all of sports. He was
firm, yet reasonable. He could not have
made a better decision.

Ueberroth, as usual, had only one
consideration. What would be in the
best interests of baseball? He knew that

. his decision would turn a lot of peple

against him, but being the baseball
lover that he is, he could not sacrifice
the good of the game for political
reasons. That is what makes him one
of the greatest commissioners in
baseball history.

He has taken that all-important step
toward defeating drugs. It was one
small step for a commissioner. one
giant step for the grand ol’ game of
baseball.

Not all of the players are against drug
testing. It is foolish for an innocent
player not to want to clear his name and
the name of the sport which he loves.
If baseball is ever going to clear its
name, then those players who are for
testing are going to have to come for-
ward and make a stand against Donald
Fehr.

Baseball needs to get rid of drugs.
That means that the players must first
get rid of Fehr. I can only hope that
someday soon, they will realize that
Fehr’s stand against drug testing is do-
ing them far more harm than good.
Don’t be naive. Common sense will tell
you that mandatory drug testing is of
vital importance to the game that is our
national pastime.

We are now faced with the onset of
spring. Relief is in sight from the dark,
cold winter. The baseball world is cur-
rently experiencing the same outlook.
Therejis justification for the baseball
purists to rejoice inthe general consen-
sus that the sport will eliminate the role
of the designated hitter before 1990.
During last season (though nothing is
ever for sure), it was evident that the
pro—DH people were a rapidly dwin-
dling group.

On July 19, 1846, the very first pro-
fessional baseball game was played.
Compared to other games, baseball has
hardly changed at all in the last 140
years. It is relatively the same game.

Very few of Alexander Cartwright’s
original rules have ever been changed.
There never was, and never will be, a
need for major change. The DH
removes a vital part of the game for
two players. The pitcher does not have
to bat, and the DH does not have to
field.

What would Cartwright have to say?

What would Cartwright say about
baseball being played indoors? I know
what he would say about it, but that
kind of language would create a scan-

dal if published.

Please, I can’t stand our national an-
them, “ The Star-Spangled Banner."
Now before any of you take this the
wrong way, let me first state that I am

not a communist sympathizer, nor am
I a spy for Colonel Khadafy. Lord
knows that people have gotten weird
ideas about things that I’ve written, and
I’ve been accused of some really
ludicrous things because of this
column.

Sorry, but I’m not even all that wild
about Bruce Springsteen. I prefer John
Cougar Mellencamp. It it‘s un-
American not to laud the merits of our
national anthem and “The Boss,” then
please excuse me. (However. baseball
is my favorite sport and apple pie is my
favorite dessert.)

It’sjust that, musically, "The Star-
Spangled Banner" is a horrendous
song! This song is supposed to repre-
sent the United States of America. Why
couldn’t we at least have a decent song
to represent our country? I can think
of other patriotic songs that are better.

I would much rather have “America
The Beautiful"played before every
baseball game. People might not take
this seriously, but a national anthem is
a national song. Would you want a
sewer rat to be our national animal?

I’d like to relate two stories loosely
connected to the “turf vs. grass” argu-
ment as far as baseball surfaces are
concerned.

During the summer of 1982, I
worked at the North Park Golf Course
as part of the maintenance crew. Dur-
ing that time, I received a first-hand
education as to the upkeep of a grass
surface. Those of you who’ve seen that

speciﬁc golf course know what ﬁne

condition that it is kept in. (Remember,
a golf course needs to be kept in better
condition than a baseball ﬁeld does.)

It didn’t take much time to keep that
course in great condition, especially
since those guys knew what they were
doing. If that course can be kept in such
great condition with a handful of
workers, then will somebody please ex-
plain to me why we don’t have grass
in all of the major league ballparks? It
would take even less work, and less
people. It’s not hard with a little effort.

My parents have been friends with
this other couple since childhood. So
it’s only natural that every summer, we
spend weekends going up to their cabin
in the country. One hundred yards from
the camp, you’ll find these baseball
fields that were built a few years back
to enable some “weekend warriors" to
play softball. There are no painstaking
hours of groundskeeping that go on to
keep these fields in perfect condition.
In fact, they are rarely touched, other
than to cut the grass. Yet, they are in
remarkable condition considering the
meager amount of work that goes into
them. Why? Because when they were
built, the builders did spend painstak-
ing hours manicuring the ground. As
a result, weather has very little effect
on them.

Let me ask you: If fields were prop-
erly constructed in the first place. don’t
you think that with a little effort. all

major—league ballclubs could finance
grass fields? From what I’ve seen
firsthand, I’d say so. The problem is,
people are too lazy.

Too bad, baseball was meant to be
played on grass.

Here’s a rule that I‘d like to see on
all levels of baseball: Once a pitcher
hits three batters in the same game, he’s
ejccted..On the lower levels, he would
just be taken off the mound, but al-
lowed to continue the game at another
position.

Why do people take this so lightly?
I was recently on a bus talking to this
kid about his older brother who was in
Little League with me. I‘ll never forget
that his brother once pitched a no-
hitter, but walked 12 and hit nine bat-
ters! The reason that he got the no-
hitter was that everyone was afraid to
get near the plate! Is this baseball?

That got me to thinking that
something has to be done. In Little
League, some kids have very low

.thresholds of pain. In the major

leagues, players can get killed by 90
m.p.h. fastballs. Why is it that some
maniacs are allowed to throw at bat-
ters? I am thinking especially of a cer-
tain player who has a bit of a temper
and was recently traded.

This is one issue in which I won’t
even bother to listen to the other side.
This is not part of the game! If you
think so, then why can’t batters throw
the bats at pitchers?

I know, it’s a judgement call, and my
rule won’t Solve the problem. But
would it hurt?

Baseball has fewer faults than any
other sport. That’s why it’s my
favorite. But that’s no reason to not try
to change those few faults.

We want to hear

what you think!

Apartheid: Facts and Responses

A Teach—ln at Carnegie Mellon University

March 10, 1986

By John Enright
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther basketball team
struggled to an 11-16 record and a
sixth—place finish in the Big East con-
ference this season, but head coach
Kirk Bruce had no complaints with his
players.

“Our kids really played to the best
of their abilities. We got the most out
of a lot of players on this team," said
Bruce. “Individually, our five starters
had pretty good years, maybe they

’didn’t combine to make a good season

for us, but individually they did well."

Bruce was also pleased with his
team’s effort but not with the less—than—
mediocre record. “There were a few
games I thought we should have won.
Anytime you lose more games than you
win, you‘re never really satisfied,"

added Bruce. “But with a lot of the .,

young, inexperienced players that we
have, we hung in there with a lot of
teams we probably shouldn’t have."
Bruce’s biggest problem next season
will be replacing his two senior guards.
Kim Tirik and Kim Gannis. “It’s go-
ing to be tough to replace their scor-
ing and leadership,” said Bruce. “But
I’m hoping we will get a lot of leader-
ship from our front-court people.”
Indeed, the Lady Panthers should be

able to dojust that. as the entire front-
court returns next season. The follow-
ing players will be returning next year:
6-0 forward Sally Sheerer. 5-10 for-
ward Jane Plake, 6-5 center Jenny
Tyner and 5-11 Tabatha Long.

To add to the Lady Panthers‘ attack.
Bruce has already signed two local high
school stars. Jenny Schingler. a'5—7
guard from Altoona. and Lorri
Johnson. a 5-11 guard/forward from
New Castle, both signed with Pitt last
November.

Schingler and Johnson are regarded
as two of the top four high school
players in the state this season. and
Bruce couldn’t be any more pleased
that they will attend Pitt. “Jenny isjust
a good. solid player. and she's not go-
ing to make mistakes,” said Bruce.

Johnson. who scored 53 points in a
game this season, received the highest
praise from her soon—to~be college
coach. “There‘s no question about
Lorri‘s ability. She has to be one of the
top five [high school] players in the
East." commented Bruce. “And I rank
her up there with Edna Campbell [a
high school All—America from Pitts-
burgh’s Taylor—Allerdice High School]
ability wise.”

Pitt will have a hard time finding
replacements at the guard positions,
although 5-5 Valerie Halesworth and
5-7 Jill Sitlinger should have an edge

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

  

because of the experience they both‘

gained this season.

Halesworth. a talented but
sometimes erratic player. could be the
starting point guard for the Lady Pan—
thers next year. but Bruce sees an area
she must improve on.

“She has to come back here with a
better attitude [next season]. She had
a good attitude this season, but at times

it faltered because she wasn’t playing _

that much,” said Bruce.
If Sitlinger and Halesworth don't

come through. the possibility could‘?

exist that either Schingler or Johnson
would start as a freshman. “I'm not
one to say a freshman cannot come in
and start. I don’t like that [starting a
freshman] mainly because they haven’t
adjusted to the college game in my
opinion.“ said Bruce. “However,
there are exceptions to that rule."

Bruce will also have a difficult time
replacing Gannis and Tirik's leadership
qualities, but he has high hopes for next
year’s senior class of Tyner, Plake,
Paul and Novosel.

“We expect our four [returning]

seniors to be ready to go next year. We

expect them to play all summer,” said
Bruce. ‘‘I don’t want four seniors sit-
ting on the bench. I don't want any of

them on the bench. I’m looking for S

Tyner, Plake, Paul and Novosel to
show a lot of leadership next year.”
The future sounds bright for the
Lady Panther basketball program.
Bruce is a good, young coach and has
taken the necessary steps to upgrade the
program. First of all, Bruce has
eliminated the “cupcakes” from Pitt’s
non—conference schedule. Next season,
the Lady Panthers play Penn State and
Stanford at home, while going on the
road for tough games at Marshall and
Eastern Kentucky. Bruce took NAIA
schools Gannon and St. Vincent’s off
the schedule.
, Improving the schedule was a
necessity, and it was most likely in-

strumental in Bruce’s ability to landir

top-quality players like Schingler and
Johnson.

“You have to start playing the bet-
ter talent. then you have to bring in the
better players yourself. You always
want to play the best,” added Bruce.

Pitt now has the talent to go along
with next season’s difficult schedule.
Hopefully, the 1986-87 Lady Panthers
will be able to defeat some of their
powerful opponents, something they
failed to do this season.

Track teams head to championships

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

This Saturday and Sunday, the men’s
track team will be competing in the
65th annual IC4A track meet at Prince-
ton University. There will be 24 men
participating in the events over the two-
day period against a host of qualiﬁers
from over 100 other schools in the
eastern portion of the United States.
According to men‘s head coach John
Vasvary, this is one of the most

prestigious meets held in the country
and at one time was considered to be
the national championship. It is con-
sidered to be quite an accomplishment
to place among the finalists in this
meet, and this year, Pitt has a very
good chance of doing just that.

The men who Vasvary feels have the
best chance of doing well in the meet
are mainly involved in the sprints, but
there is a distance man included as well
as both of the relay teams.

People who have a chance of plac-

ing are: Lee McRae and Zeke Gadsen
in the 55—meter dash; Eric Cannon,
Calvin Holmes, Jason Harris and
George Ifill in the 55—meter hurdles;
Thomas Boggan in the 800—meter run;
Joe Daniels, Tim Manes, Dave Moore
and Bob Weiner of the two-mile relay
team; and Dorell Hilliman, Alan Laws,
Jesse Mikell and Vernon Reed of the
mile relay team.

Vasvary was very enthusiastic about
the way he felt the team would do in
competition. In fact, he feels very
strongly about the way his hurdlers
should perform. “Calvin Holmes and
Jason Harris were in the finals last
year, and they. along with Eric Can-
non, are expected to do something in
the hurdles." Vasvary stated.

The men finished 12th in the overall
standings in last year’s competition,

this year. “Our main goal is to move
up from last year’s finish, but this will
also be a good test of the athletes to see
how they perform under pressure,“
Vasvary commented.

and they are hoping to do even better

“Our main goal is to move
up from last year ’s ﬁnish, but
this will be a good test of the
athletes to see how they per-
form under pressure. ”

While the men are competing in
Princeton, the women will be at Yale
University competing in the Eastern
Track and Field Championships for the
first time since 1984. It will also be a
two—day meet held on March 8 and 9.

Altogether, there will be nine women
who will be competing, but some were

These nine will be going up against
some very stiff competition that will be

eastern half of the United States. For
the women, this will be the most com-

Although it would be nice for the
women to come home having done well
as a team at the meet, head coach Steve
Lewis does not want that to be his main
objective. “We are going to take this
meet on an individual level, culmi-
nating in the opportunity for the kids
to run on a higher level with our main
objective to be to enhance perform-
ances in their best events,” Lewis said.

“But,” he added, “if everybody has
a good day, we could score well in the
