Biddle Named

Service Head
For Veterans

The University has appointed
Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle
in complete charge of the school’s
program for veterans. As Direct-
or of Personnel Service for Vet-
erans,»Dean Biddle will handle
all matters pertaining to dis-
discharged servicemen and wom-
en in any way. V
A Under present regulations there
are two laws under which veter-
ans may receive educational aid.
The -ﬁrst is ‘Public Law 16, the
Veterans’ Disability Act, which
provides government payments to
those servicemen disabled in any
way. Payments will be made to
cover the expenses of schooling
for as much as four years, includ-
ing purchase of s-upplies, support
while in school, and support for
dependants during that time._ A
disabled veteran may receive $50-
a month or more.

All servic-emen not included un-
der the provisions of the disability
Act will come under the provi-
sions of Public Law 346, the GI
Bill. Each man who has served
at lea-st 90 days in the armed
services, and is under 25 years of
age, may receive payments cov-

"“=ering the costs“ of schooling for

as many months as he was in
active service plus twelve. Thus,
a soldier who served for 15
months may expect the govern-
ment to pay for 27 months of
schooling, which, assuming nine
months to the school year, would,
in extent of time, [be three full
school years. A veteran may re-
ceive as much as $50 a month, but
not more than $500 in any normal
school year.

Free Association

Rules Revised

Rules for free association be-
tween fraternity women and non-
fraternity women were revised
duringthe summer by Panhellenic
Council, headed by Dodie I-Iurrell,
C. Georgette Zinser, C, secretary
of Panhel, has sent a copy of the
rules to every fraternity woman.

There will be no rushing until
February 22, 1945 with the excep-
tion of a fall tea November 14,
1944.

Freshmen women and new
transfers will have no luncheon
dates on Mondays or Wednesdays.
These days are reserved for lunch-
eons with senior mentors and other
freshmen. Sophomores, Juniors,
and Seniors may make luncheon
dates with freshmen women for
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays
only.

 H. S.Diploma
 Not Required

Of Veterans

The University of Pittsburgh has
arranged to use tests provided by
the United States Armed Forces

Navy agency, to supplement the
high school records of veterans
returning from the armed serv-
ices. "The Armed Forces Insti-
tute, whose work is approved by
the American Council on Educa-
tion and by the Various regional
accrediting agencies, will provide
any veteran upon request with a
set of credentials for his educa-
tional experience in the armed
for-ces plus the s-cores of the stand-
ardized tests of educational com.-
petence which he has taken.

Many veterans already were
high school graduates when they
entered the armed services, and a
large number had completed some
college work. These will be ad-
mitted by the University in the
regular way and will receive ad-
vanced standing credit for suita-
ble courses completed while in the
service. Many others , _‘WhO were
not high school gr.adVates'v‘vhe‘n
they were inducted will be able to
get diplomas from their high
schools by presenting the AFI cre-
dentials and tests scores. The vet-
erans who thus become high school
graduates: can then apply for ad-
mission in the regular way.

In some cases, where the vet-_
eran is unable to make such ar-
rangements with his high
school, the University when-
ever possible will recognize ed-
ucational competence which, as
revealed by the AFI, represents
the equivalent of high school
graduation. Individuals who
have not taken these tests while
in the service may take them at
the University.

Veterans who are more than 21
years of age may be admitted
without credentials as adult spec-
ial students, but they will be ex-
pected later to present evidence of

in’

having approximated the usual en-
trance requirements before‘ they
can become candidates for de-
grees.

Van Meter Leaves
Faculty Position

Dr. C. T. Van Meter, professor
of chemistry and physics at the
Pitt School of Pharmacy, has re-
signed his position to become Di-
rector of Chemical Research for
the Reed & Carnrick Company in
Jersey City, New Jersey.

Dir. Van Meter came to Pitts-
burgh from East Liverpool, Ohio,
in 1924. After graduating from
the .Schoo-l of Pharmacy in 1926,
he joined the faculty and has
taught there continuously since
that time. ‘Meanwhile, he obtain-
ed his degree of Doctor of Philos-
ophy from the University where
he majored in organic chemistry.

Dr. Van Meter is widely known
in pharmaceutical, chemical and
educational circles in this district.
Within recent years he has also
taken a very active interest in
plastics; at present he is on the
Board o-f Directors of the Pitts-
burgh Plastics Engineers Society.

In his new position, Dr. Van
Meter will head the recently cre-
ated chemical research depart-
ment of Reed & Carnrick, which
will have as its main objective the
synthesis of new medicinal sub-
stances. He expects to assume his
new duties about October 15.

Theodore W. Biddle as his per-
sonal oﬂice, will revert to class-
room use.

The Pitt News, Men's Debating
Association, Pitt Players, and the
YMCA will, by the end of this
week, be set up in their new
quarters on the eighth floor of
the Cathedral. It is planned that
the eighth ﬂoor shall be designed
as the permanent home of ac-
tivities. The exact place each
will occupy on the ﬂoor, how-
ever, has been decided only ten-
tatively, and present space ar-
rangements may be regarded as

only temporary.

The Pitt News will be located
in the entire wing of the building
on the Forbes Street side.

~Men’s Debating Association will
be stationed in an office leading
offthe Pitt News on the Belle-
ﬁeld side of the Cathedral. Both
Pitt Players and the YMCA‘ are
placed in the wing of the build-
ing on the Belleﬁeld side..

The Owl is temporarily to loc-
cupy both its present ofﬁce and
the former Pitt News oﬂice on
the ground ﬂoor. However, with-
in a short time, it will join the
other activities in permanent of-
ﬁces on the eighth ﬂoor.

What’s the best known vehicle on your college campus? You will
probably agree it’s the Railway Express truck. And one of the best-

There's a good reason why these trucks are on the campus so fre-

Panthers Open Against West Virginia

Begin ’44« Card
At Stadium

The 1944 football edition of the
Pitt Panthers will take the Sta-
dium ﬁeld this Saturday to open
its schedule against the Mountain-
eers from the University of West
Virginia. Ignoring the fact that
many colleges throughout the
country ﬁnd it impossible to con-
tinue under the heavy pressures
caused by the war, our footballers
are again ready to carry on, despite

‘terriﬁc odds, and ﬁeld their third

wartime eleven.

It will be the second season for
Coach -Clark D. Shaughnessy at
Pitt, and the renowne-d master of
the “T” formation has been work-
ing desperately to round his squad
of 17-year olds, freshmen, 4-F’s,
and what few Navy men there are

- into shape.

With the Qontest being the
opener for the Mountaineers as
well as the “Cats,” it is impossi-
ble to predict the favorite, but
past performances favor Pitt.
Dating away back to 1895 when
West Virginia captured an 8-0 win
over Pitt, the two teams have met
36 times. Pitt has been victorious
in 27 engagements, while the Men
from the Mountain have won but
six. Three contests have ended in
a deadlock. The Panthers have
taken 12‘ straight triumphs over

YWest Virginia, including a 20-0

win last season.

There will be a preliminary
meeting for all basketball ap-
plicants at 4:30 Tuesday after-
noon, October 3rd, in the Sta-
-dium. A chalk talk and possi-
ble workout are slated and all
those interested are urged to
attend.

Wlhen summer practice began
last June, s-ome 17 holdovers from
last year’s squad put in an appear-

ance. Shaughnessy used them as
nucleus around which he built
this year’s squad-. To these he
added some 45 freshmen and for
ﬁnal good luck threw in Angelo
Carlaccini and Larry Braner two
veterans; from ’42 who are to be
discharged from the ASTP in
Dental School. Aided: by Hartwig,
Fortmann, Olenn, and Hoel, he

mixed well, worked hard, and on
‘Saturday will put on displayhis
product, the 1944 edition of the
Golden Panthers.

Despite all the optimism sur-
rounding the team it must be re-
membered the Pitts as a whole are
still an untried team and are lack-
ing in experience in some key’ po-
sitions. Also the -caliber of teams
we are facing is tops. Army will
have the most powerful team in

its history. Penn State is very

Dr. Raschen Writes
Song For ‘Infantry

It was a iﬁne situation! Of all
the important branches of the
service only the Infantry lacked a

Marines had their famous Hymn;
the Navy bellowed Anchors
Aweigh; the Air Corps ﬂew off
into “the wide blue yonder;” even
the Sea-Bees could “whistle while
they worked.” But the Infantry-—
ha! All the poor guys ‘had was the
aging “'Made.moise11e from Armen-

So, Dr. J. F. L. Raschen, of the
University’s German department
-decided to do something for the
foot soldier who wanted to sing
but -couldn’t. He knew what a
lively tune and lusty words
would do for droo.ping morale.

The Song of G.'I. Joe

On Attu——thirty below—
Mile by mile up from Messina
(Slugs and charges IG. 1. Joe.
Never napping, never slacking,
Though his dogs are caked with
mud‘,
At the Nips and J erries whacking,
E-Ie ‘plods on through stench and
blood.

Yes, the slugging G. I. Joe

Major In Aviation Offered
Pitt Students This Year

Future students in the College of the University of Pittsburgh

can be graduated with a “major” in aviation, that is with at least 24 p
of the 120' credits required for graduation earned in navigation, me— .

teorology, or geography.

In the freshman and sophomore
years, certain subjects will be re-
quired. In the junior and senior
years, however, the program is to
be ﬂexible, changing with changes
in the aviation industry. It will
include opportunities for ﬂight
training. Since all other under-
graduate schools of the university
can contribute special instruction,
the committee recommended the
new program be established on a
university-wide basis.

The committee is headed by Dr.
James S. Taylor and has as mem-

or

bers Dr. Whitford'B. Shelton, Dr.
Richard Hope, and Dr. Florence
Teagarden.

Students may elect aviation as
a major subject with the opening
of the fall semester September 25.

Besides the aviation “majors” a
number of elective courses. are
open to students specializing in
other ﬁelds. These electives in-
clude civil air regulations, ele-

mentary meteorology, geography’

for aviation, the history of air
power, navigation, physics, and
ﬂight and climate.
