New Engineering Dean Announced

Identification Card
Committee Set

SENATOR John Dugan, vice-president of Student Union Board, gives
a Spirit Committee report before Student Union. The committee de-
cided on the elimination of basketball games and Winter Weekend
from the list of events to be judged.

By FRED FRANK _
Student Government unanimously passed a resolution
appointing a committee to study the possibility of initiat-

‘ ing an all-purpose identiﬁcation card. In further action at

last Thursday night’s meeting James Golding was named
clfairrnan of Pitt Preview.

Senator Martin Engels, who proposed the ID‘ card bill
and who will chair the committee, stated .that he hoped the

 
   

Dr. Harold E. Hoels cher Named;

Dr. Harold E. Hoelscher of the Johns
Hopkins University has been named dean
of the Schools of Engineering and Mines at
the University.

The new dean,’ known for his contribu-
tions to the changing needs of engineering
education, will assume his post July 1, Chan-
cellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld announced today. At
present, Walter R. Turkes, professor and chairman
of industrial engineering, is acting dean of the
school.

Dr. Hoelscher’s appointment closely follows the
start of the University’s planned engineering com-
plex, which will rise in the heart of the science and
engineering areas on campus.

Presently, Dr. Hoelscher is professor and chair-
man of the chemical engineering department at
Johns Hopkins, where he has been on the faculty
for 12 years. Two years ago, he was Senior Ful-
bright Lecturer in the Alagappa Chettiar College
at the University of Madras, India. He also has
served as consultant to a number of industrial
concerns.

“We are most pleased to have Professor Hoels-
cher join us,” Chancellor Litchﬁeld said. “His broad
background in scientiﬁc and engineering research
and development makes his appointment particular-
by ﬁtting in the light of the University’s increasing
emphasis on interdisciplinary research and the
‘spin-off’ of rearch ﬁndings to area industry _

“We feel sure that Professor Hoelscher will play
a signiﬁcant role in the acceleration of research and
in developingwhat we hope will become an impor-
tant research base for the economy of the region,”
the Chancellor added. '

  Assumes New Position On Julyl

In his areas of specialization—heat and mass
transfer, and reactor dynamics—Dr. Hoelscher has
published widely in technical and professional iour-
nals. His views on education also have been widely
published and last year his paper. “B6301!!! Today's
Frontier," was distributed overseas by the United
State Information Service. Other titles dealing with
engineering education are “Science, Engineering and
Change,” “The Education and Training of Engi-

neers,” and “The University Contribution to the '

Success of an Engineer.”

Professor Hoelscher received his Ph.D. in chemi- '
cal engineering from Washington University. He is
a graduate of Princeton University, and he has
served on t-he faculties of Washington University
and the University of Cincinnati.

The new dean is a registered professional engi-
neer in the states of Ohio and Maryland and has
served as consultant to a number of chemical com-
panies. In 1962, he was special master (an oﬁicer
of the bench) to the Chief Justice of the U.S. Fed-
eral Court in Baltimore, Md. He has served as con-
sulting editor of the Addison-Wesley" Publishing
Co., and as a consultant to the Heyden-Newport
Chemical Corp. of New York and American'Cyana-
mid Co.

Among his professional activitiesare: the Amer-
ican Institute of Chemical Engineers, president of
local section, 1962-63, and chairman" of the com-
mittee on kinetics and reactor design; the American
Chemical Society; the Instrument Society of Ameri-
ca; the American Society of Engineering Education;
the Society for Applied Anthropology. He is also
a member of Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, Phi Lambda

. Upsilon and Alpha Chi Sigma.

 

card could serve the purpose that

 the Athletic Identiﬁcation Card,

I 3. the academic invoice and build-

ing passes now serve. The pro-
posed card would last for four
years and would be renewed each
year.

Senator Marcia Bernstein said
that if the all-purpose card were
used it could be distributed at

5‘the beginning of the trimester.

She reminded the senators of the
many problems arising when ‘a
student does not have a validated
invoice until the second or third
week of the term.
Despite Senator Engels’ point
‘ that similar systems had worked
at the University of Michigan and
Pennsylvania, State University,
Senator Janet McKeever doubted
that any card could last through
four years of use. Mark Senick
reminded the senators that it

tions and urged the -end of the
debate.

Student Government also allo-
cated $250 for the annual “S”
Award, given to an outstanding

_member of the student body for
‘study abroad during the summer
months.

The senate invited Dr. Doug-
lass S. Thompson, director of the
Student Health Service, and Fred
S. Robie, director of Alumni Ac-
tivities, to speak at future sen-

HEP Recruiting Drive
Concludes Tomorrow

By NANCY FUCHS
The Hill Education Project (HEP) is making rapid
strides toward its recruitment goal of 100 additional tutors.
Approximately 40 prospective tutors have signed up at the
HEP booth which will remain open until 4 p.m. tomorrow,
gpplosite the Student Desk in the ground ﬂoor of the Cathe-
ra .
They will join some 100 tutors from last trimester. In

addition, HEP hopes to interest 20 or 30 more students in
team teaching and at least ten in settlement house work, swelling the

ranks to some 250 persons. The increased numbers will enable HEP
to spread its activities from Heldman Center on Center Ave. to Wads-
worth Hall and Soho. ,

An orientation program for prospective tutors will be held
Wednesday at 8 p.m. in the Student Union Supper Room. Students
who do not sign up at the booth before it is taken down tomorrow

‘afternoon may apply at the program. A movie of the technique for

teaching the new mathematics will be shown. According to Irv
Garfinkel, co-chairman of HEP, the math technique can be carried
over into the teaching _ of other subjects.

David Epperson, co-ordinator for the Equal Educational Oppor-
tunities Program and HEP advisor. will orient new tutors to what he
terms the “disadvantaged community” of the Hill. At the end of the
program, students will separate into small buzz sessions.

Tutors are especially needed in mathematics and science. The
majority of tutees are of high school age. Tutors are expected to
devote a minimum of two hours per week to the job, however, two
two-hour sessions per week are preferred,

Students also do team teaching in elementary schools during
school time. Others are involved with settlement house work: lead-
ing club groups, teaching arts and crafts, or directing interest groups
such as drama or cooking.

The newest phase is the teaching of the new mathematics, con-
ducted primarily‘ through the efforts of Dr, Henry Cohen, assistant
professor of mathematics, and other faculty members.

HEP began as a pilot project of college students home in Pitts- .

burgh for the summer of 1963. That fall the project was taken over
by University students and in a year and a half has become what
“largest student movement on campus."

A PM Series .Hits Sour Note Thursday

By BARRY SHAW

For the most part, one might
just have well stayed home for
the Pittsburgh Symphonetta’s
concert Thursday at the PM
Series. Although intimacy was
aﬁorded by a large orchestra in
a small room, this was a detri-
mental factor to the group since
it only pointed up their ﬂaws.

The Syria Mosque has bad
acoustics, but at least it covers‘
up mistakes.

After a brief overture by Ros-
sini, the Symphonetta, under the
direction of I-Iaig Yaghjian, went
barrelling into Mozart’s “Sym-
phony No. 35.” Only here did the
proximity of the orchestra serve
to highlight a piece, as the
throaty quality of the strings
was brought forth in the ﬁrst
and last movements.

Unfortunately if one doesn’t like
Mozart played with hard violins,
and if one doesn’t like Mozart
played with the ﬁre of Beetho-
ven, the Mozart performance was
a letdown. Yaghjian rushed
through the piece without breath-
ing once so that the subtlety and
near gentility of Mozart was lost.

The ﬁrst section of the concert
closed with a satisfactory per-
formance of the “Moto Perpetuo”
by Paganini.

The major work of the evening

A was the Mendelssohn Violin Con-

cert with Samuel Thaviu, soloist.
In going to hear a symphony or

5 especially, a concerto, one ex-

pects that at least the ‘soloist will

Outstanding  

{Prof Contest

To Be Held

Students may vote for their
choice of the outstanding pro-
fessors of the University during
“Owl Week,” Jan. 25-29.

Voting forms will be available
on the ground ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral and Towers lobby, and space
will be provided for ﬁrst, second
and third choice. Invoices must
be presented in order to vote.

The results will be published
in the.“Great Professors” secton
of The Owl, a practice started
by the yearbook in 1963.

hit the right notes so that the
listener can make judgments on
his insight into the music.

Thaviu did not even afford this
reviewer that courtesy. He was
both sharp and ﬂat at various in-
stances throughout the piece, and
unnecessarily brilliant or un-
steady during the longer holds.
‘He did not even hit most of the
notes solidly. At some points dur-
ing the evening Thaviu did seem
to settle down, but somehow he
lost it iigain, making the experi-
ence even more exasperating.

Thaviu did have insight; he
showed a light touch at times
‘and made some blending in-
nuendos. But on the whole, the
performance was poor. At times,
especially during the coda, of the
ﬁrst movement, the soloist and
orchestra sounded no better than
hurdy-gurdy and the last move-
ment was saved by the merits of
the music alone.

The Symphonetta then played
Brahms’ “Hungarian Dance No.
1.” Here at least, the orchestra
was part of the music and re-
sponded to Yaghjian’s call for a
strong Hungarian rhythm. But,
whether due to the acoustics or
to the haphazard sound of the
Woodwinds, the scoring for this
section at times did not blend
well. They ﬂuttered above the
orchestra producing a distracting
effect. Nevertheless this piece was
done competently and was the

« best performed work of any merit.

The concert closed with se-
lections from “My Fair Lady.”

New Academic Year

Studied at Williams

(Collegiate Press Service) ,

A faculty committee at Williams College, Williams-
town, Mass., has begun the study of a possible tri-partite
academic year, termed the 4-2-4 plan, it was announced by

President John E. Sawyer.

The decision to undertake a two-year study follows a
year-long consideration by‘ the faculty of the development
of a capacity for self-education in students.

Under the new program being
studied, students would take four
courses in the ﬁrst period (fall),
two courses in the middle term

_ (winter), and four courses in the
ﬁnal period (spring). Individual
faculty members will experiment
in their classrooms, particularly
at the freshman and sophomore
level. _ ‘A

Under the arrangement to be
studied,‘ a student would nor-
mally take ten units of work in
any academic year, as he does
now, however, he would take no

more than four at one time.

Despite the Peace Corps, the

ment of the Presidential cam-
paign year, most American col-
lege students remain politically
passive, a Stanford educator con.
tends. But the small minority of
so-called activists — the ones who
inspire talk of a political revival
on campus — have gained great-
er respectability among their fel-
low students, says Prof. Nevitt
Sanford, director of the Institute
for the Study of Human Prob-
lems.

provement it has made in its reg-
istration process within the past

' ’ few years.

As a graduate student I can_

' remember ﬁghting long line after
’ long line in the Syria Mosque or

the Commons Room. Then pre-
registration came, but this didn't
to make too much of an improve-
ment.

But apparently the University,
with the help of some IBM ma-
chines, has ironed out all of the
ﬂaws.

I am happy to say it took me
about ten minutes to complete
the entire registration process

. this term.

A Biology Course H

Receives Praise
Editor, The Pitt News:

A There «has been much discus-

I sion latey about weaknesses in

the Distribution of Studies pro-

gram. I, as most other students,
" have had my share of poor dis-

tribution courses and was con-

, sequently pleasantly surprised this

fall trimester with a course that
had for me, ominous potential-
ities.

The ‘ course was Biology 80
which turned out to be one of
the most rewarding and inter-
esting courses I have encountered
at this University. Even though
approximately one half of the
students enrolled in the course
were potential Biology majors,

" ~ the- course ; was broad in; -scope

and yet comprehensible to the
student with no or very little
background in the natural sci-
ences.

Part of the merit of the course
was due to the organization of
the material and the manner in
which it was presented, but the
primary value of the course was
derived from the attitude and
interest of the instructor, Dr.
Cumrnins.

His lectures were stimulating,
and with an enrollment of close
to 400 students, he urged each
one to make an appointment to

see him at least once during the,

term to discuss any aspect of the
course. It was clear throughout
the term that his primary inter-
est was that of being a “teacher”
in the true sense of the word
and that his lectures were pre-
sented TO the students .and not
AT them.

My only regret is that Dr. Cum-

mins is the only professor of this ’"

caliber that I have encountered
in the Distribution of Studies
program. Perhaps the reaction of
students to this program would
become more favorable if more
of the courses could demonstrate
the quality of Biology 80.

AiPhi|os-ophicalQuestion 

In viewing the recent proposals for changed women’s housing regulations, people
seem more optimistic about the success of letting 21-year-old women live off-campus
than they do about removing curfews for those seniors who choose to live in the dorms.

In actual practice, there should be no technical problem with the women living off-
campus, assuming all of them were in University approved housing. But the second pro-

posal involves two objections that might be enough to veto it.

First of all is the armoyance of having girls trouping into the dormitories “at all
hours of the night.” This might involve some additional bookwork and responsibility
for the men sitting at the desks and the policemen on duty in the Quadrangle, the oppon-
ents point out. But actually, the number of girls who would be trouping in would be rela-
tively small. These women will be attending school with the same responsibilities for get-

ting up for 8 and 9:00 classes as when they had curfews. Late nights would be excep-

tions, but this in no way affects the fact that these women should have the privilege to

stay out if they choose.

The mechanics for late entry into the dorms is already set up in part for graduate
students; it would only need some expansion. Men sit at the desks in most of the dorms
all night so that these girls would have no trouble getting in. For the other buildings,
a campus policeman is on duty at all times in the Quadrangle when the doors are locked
after 1 :00 a.m. on weekdays and 3:00 on weekends. The sign-out procedure could be com-
pleted as usual on the same rationals that it was instituted: if in emergency that girl is
needed, she can be found. In this cause there would simply be no curfew but a sign-in
check for the head resident to know if the girl is in the dorm or still out.

Another drawback is supposedly the stir the senior might make living in a suite
with underclassmen. This is a fallacy; girls can make just as much disturbance if they
are in the dorm at 8 p.m. as if they came in late. In fact, girls kept in by curfews with a
great deal of pent up energy might do better to release it outside the dorm than to
bother those who want to study inside it.

This request must be judged on the basis of philosophy: Does the administration
feel that University women are mature enough to handle this responsibility? As for the
technical problem and the matter of consideration—these are splitting hairs.

 S Dilemma 

s   Problems of

Being Popu ar 

 by Alex D’Ippolito

With the new year and the

89th Congress still in the in-
fancy stage, Lyndon John-
son may have more trouble
ahead of him than his No-
vember vote would seem to
indicate..

Although the President
has large enough majorities
to get almost any program
 I “  he needs to
' ' ’ make his so-
  ciety great,
_' the problem
V __ lies in the

‘ fact that too
 many people
j with diver-
gent views all
feel Johnson

DTPP01-ITO is on their
side and therefore expect
him to be the genie to all
their special needs.

This is a trick that even
Lyndon’s magic wand may
have trouble performing.

With the millions of dol-
lars organized labor poured
into LBJ’s campaign, unions
-can be expected to press a
little harder than usual for
pet projects like the 35 hour
work week, repeal of section
14 (b) of the ‘Taft-Hartly
Act which allows states to
pass right-to-work laws, and
raising the minimum wage
to two dollars an hour.

BUT AT THE same time
many businessmen who sup-
ported Johnson expect him to
help in holding the line on
wage increases and strikes.
These same men also hope
that the word “profit” will
be looked upon with more
favor from Washington.

Also, the congressmen and
senators from the 20 states
which do have right—to-work
laws (the majority of these
states, of course, gave their
electoral votes to Johnson)
can be expected to ﬁght hard
against anything which
would repeal their state’s
laws.

ised that Uncle will pay some
of their medical bills while
youngsters have been prom-
ised that they will be able
to keep more of the money
they earn; but at the same
time their social security
taxes will have to be in-
creased to pay for the old-
sters’ medical bills.

The public is told that pov-
erty will be eliminated, that
education will be improved,
that slums will be elimin-
ated, that urban transporta-
tion problems will be solved,-
that farm incomes will rise,
that solutions to heart dis-
ease will be found, and that
cancer will be cured (with-
out even giving up smoking)
—and at the same time grass
will be planted on the banks

. of the Pedernales River and

auto junkyards will be re-
moved so Lady Bird won’t
have to get sore eyes on trips
any more.

WHILE THE Federal bud-
get grows to pay for all
these goodies, expenditures
will be kept to a minimum,
taxes will be cut, and the
budget will be balanced to
satisfy those who worry
about more academic things
like gold ﬂow, balance of pay-
ments, sound currency, and
inﬂation.

On the foreign front the
President admits a few prob-
lems like South Viet Nam, _
Panama, and the Congo, but

   
  

  

efforts will be madeto solve 1

these problems.

The Russian leaders will
visit America and speak to
the American people on TV
“so they can learn about our
country at ﬁrst hand.” After
this “misunderstanding”
about America is cleared up
we will be able to live as
brothers in the world.

JOHNSON HAS thus prom-
ised to be ﬁrm and strong
for those who feel we should
be ﬁrm and strong (like
munitions manufacturers
and war-mongers), while at
the same time sponsoring a
television show for
who desire peace. This makes
everybody happy, and hap-
piness is Lyndon’s business.

Lyndon J ohnson’s problem
is not one of popularity but
that of deciding which
friends are more important
and which ones will be fav-
ored. I

By promising everything
to everybody Johnson is in a
position of being unable to
satisfy anyone completely.
He may even ﬁnd himself up .
the; mainstream without a
paddle or a canoe.

 Professor Bromberger Discusses-if   it

‘Why’ - Questions, Explanation

By PETE HORN
“Why”—questions and ex-
planations were discussed by

Professor Sylvain Bromberg-

er of the University of Chi-
cago in his Philosophy of
Science lecture last Wednes-
day night in Clapp Hall au-
itorium.

Bromberger’s eﬁorts were di-
rected toward providing a better
understanding of what there is
in general about “why” —— ques-
tions that enables them to be

answered in a relevant way.
Basically, he said, this is done

by providing the asker with a

more complete law than he had
realized existed.‘

When someone asks, “Why is
the sky purple today?” we ﬁrst
inquire, “Is the slqr purple to-

day?” If it is, then we ask, “Why
shouldn’t the sky be purple to-

day?” This trivial-sounding ques-

tion forces the asker to tell us
the law which he believes is now
being contradicted. Thus, he
might have believed that the sky
is never purple.

In order to provide him with

a correct (relevant) explanation,
we tell him, “On sunny days the
sky is indeed blue unless there
exists a certain set or sets of
circumstances, in the event of
which the sky is not blue.” «We
may continue, for instance, “We
are now looking at the world
through rose-colored glasses, and
so the sky looks purple.”

The “fact” of the purple sky
has then been deducted from the
more complete law and the given I
conditions, and thereby “explain-
ed.” The original law would be,
“On sunny-days the sky is blue
and not another color.” But the
fact is, the sky is (or seems) an-
other color—purple. So‘ we are
asked “Why?”

Bromberger showed we set up
an explanation in the form, “Sun-
ny days are blue-sky days unless
certain conditions prevail, and
these other conditions are now
prevalent.” The explanation com-
pletes the asker’s knowledge by

‘telling him what information

must be added to his original in-
formation in order to enable him
to deduce the existing fact.

Professor Bromberger claimed
that his method, .a modiﬁed ver-
sion of Carl Hempe1’s “deductive
nomological” explanation model,
is sufficient for providing an ex-
planation.

Syracuse Monsters
Dominate Mat Meet

By BILL CABIN
Syracuse's “big" men dominated the Wrestling
meet Saturday at Syracuse, defeating the matmen,
23-11. Lou Roberts, Gerry Everling, and Jim Nance
scored 15 of the Orangemen’s 23 points in their up-

Disaster struck after the 157-pound match,
with the matmen holding a 9-6 lead. Roberts began the up-
per-weight demolition, pinning George Huson with a cradle
at 1:04 in the ﬁrst period of the 167-pound match.

Bill Beck continued his winless streak of last year, losing
the 191-pound match to Everling, Everling, who was injured
most of last year, pinned Beck with a body press at 8:08.

Nance won the heavyweight match by default. Bill Bo-
dle was scheduled to wrestle, but suffered a bruised rib dur-
ing practice and did not make the trip. Coach Rex Peery
indicated he might use a lower weight man instead of de-
faulting, but he felt Nance was too good to risk an inillry
to his already depthless squad.

Lee Hall salvaged the only match in the upper weights,
by gaining a draw with Tom Chlendorf in the 177-pound
division. Chlendorf," rated as the best 177-pounder in the East
prior to the meet, having two victories against last year’s

Syracuse coach John Carlin anticipated the outcome
prior to the meet. “Our boys are tougher in the upper-
weights, but four of our ﬁve wrestlers in the 123 to 157

The matmen took advantage of the Orangemen’s inex-
perience in the lower weights, winning three of the ﬁve

against Manns, a native of West Mifflin, makes him the only

Mike Johnson showed his championship form in his ﬁrst
match of the season, defeating sophomore Dick Azone, 17-8.
Peery said before the meet, “Johnson will not wrestle against
Syracuse.” However, a knee 1111111‘! to Dino Boni made it
imperative that Johnson wrestle in the 137-pound match.

outlasted him for the 7-4 decision. Syracuse sophomore Kurt

record of 22.3 held by an ex-
Panther Rick Petterson.

Gary Martin placed third in
both the 100 and 200-yard free-
style events besides swimming in
the relay with James. “He is a
very ﬁne swimmer,” said coach
Ben Grady, “. . . and can do all
four strokes but’ is weakest in
the breaststroke. He and James
are pretty strong swimmers.”

Another member of the ﬁrst

of 2:162, 11.5 seconds off the pool
record.

Stymies Hoopsters

By FRANK SMIZIK
A poor shooting ﬁrst half
by the Panthers and excel-
lent shooting by the Cadets
of Army enabled the West

Pointers to knock off the

Panthers, 88-63. The Pan-
thers trailed at halftime, 46-18.

They only shot 26 per cent in
the ﬁrst half and could not re-
bound, either. At one time dur-
ing the first half, coach Bob Tim-
mons pulled both of his top re-

bounders, Jim LaValley and Bob
Lovett out of the game. At this
point Army went ahead to stay.

Timmons gave his boys a pep
talk at intermission and they out-
scored_ and outrebounded Army
in the second half. The Panthers
scored 45 points in the second
half to the Cadets 40, but the
ﬁrst half lead was too much to
overcome.

Sparked by the shooting of
Brian Fisher and Bob Lovett in
the second half the hoopsters
pulled to within 13 points. Then
the pressing defensive work of
Army guards Joe Kosciousko and
Dennis Shantz forced the Pan-
thers into mistakes and the Ca-
dets built on their lead.

The Panthers had trouble bring-
ing the ball up court the whole
game against the Cadets’ press.
Starting guards Dave Blyshak
and Larry Szykowny threw the
ball away inumerable times. Bly-
shak, who is usually a forward
and who had 17 points at the
guard position against West Vir-
ginia, was held to only three
points, all in the second half.

Besides the pressing defense
the Panthers were ineffective off
the boards. Army grabbed 48 re-
bounds to the Panthers’ 31. High
man for Army was Mike Silliman
with 20 rebounds and high man
for Pitt was guard Larry Szy-
kowny who had seven.

DABYLE RUBY

Scores 16 points against Cadets

Scoring wise, Dick Murray of
the Cadets was high for the Ca-
dets with 20 points. Dave Ritch
had 17 points and Silliman had
15. Bob Lovett was high scorer
for the Panthers with 18 points
and Daryle Ruby and Larry
Szykowny had 16 and 13, respec-
tively.

Tom Roantree, who was im-
pressive in his few appearances
this season, especially rebound-
ing did not make the trip to West
Point. Roantree, at six-foot-ﬁve
had proved an able replacement
at either forward or center, and
in the Bucknell game led the
team in rebounds.

Frosh Cagers

The freshman basketball team
lost its third straight game at
Steubenville Saturday night, 80-
66.

According to coach Carl Peter-
son only one Cub played well.
“Ken Bollens looked real good,”
Peterson said. “_He was hitting
hits shots but with everyone else
ice cold we couldn’t do too
much.” Bollens led the frosh with
36 points.

“Steubenville didn't overwhelm
us,” noted Peterson. “We outshot
them and we outrebounded them.
They had a boy 6-9 and we han-
dled him real well. We just
couldn't put the ball through the
hoop. Another problem was Frank
Famularo’s knee. He couldn’t
run and we had no guard capable
of substituting for him. Eli Dro-

Beaten by Steubenville

bitis was simply too tight. His
shooting was way off.

“Our other guard Tom Beck-
ett,” Peterson continued, “is
coming on and we tried Rich
Hein at both guard and forward
that night. We’re still trying to
get out feet on the ground with
the new lineup.”

With Bill Borellis and Bill Buck
ineligible for play because of
academic difficulty, the Cubs
scoring power has been weak-
ened.

A revamped lineup will try to
regain some of the lost scoring
punch and break the losing streak
as well tomorrow night against
Duquesne at the Civic Arena.

just Dave McKinnis, losing to
Syracuse, 71%-48%, Saturday.
McKtnni_s captured ﬁrst, sec-

fourths and two ﬁfths, Jim_ Sacco
won his third straight all-around

cuse.

the side horse and Tom Mlsage
' was rated third on the horizontal
hat. The Panthers highest finish-

A er on the trampoline was Gary

The gymnasts outscored the 1
Orangemen 12-4 on the sidehorse .

    New Event  

ByALJANEZIC _
Coach Warren N eiger has
two guys on his gymnastic
team who are bounding
around like a couple of
wounded gazelles. In fact,

once they start jumping, he
has four gyrrmasts who stand
around just to catch them. Neig-
er encourages it, and it’s under-
standable. This is the ﬁrst year
in the history of the school that
trampoline competition has been
included in gymnastics, and he is
taking no chances. He doesn’t
want any of his jumping gazelles
injured.

Trampolining has not been
popular in the East, and in the
past Eastern colleges have not
included it in gynmastic compe-
tition. But this year the Eastern
Intercollegiate Athletic League
and the National Collegiate Ath-
letic Assn. got together and de-
cided a change was in order.
Even so, Coach Neiger isn’t ex-
actly ecstatic about it.

“The Big Ten loves it (tram-
polining), but the East doesn’t,”
he said. “The Big Ten started
trampolining competition,_ were
successful and are proud of it.
So they kept it. But many coach-
es believe its dangerous and fear

The result of this feeling is
Neiger is
such a stickler on preventing in-
juries.

“I yell til‘ I'm blue in the face
about caution in practice,” he
said.

He probably remembers back
to 1962 when he saw a gymnastic
meet at the University of Al-
buqerque in New Mexico when a
boy ﬂew oﬁ the trampoline and
hit his head on the ﬂoor, suffer-
ing serious injury._ Before that
time there were no mats under
