EU names Pitt ‘Center for Excellence‘

. S by Brandon Ellis
Staﬂ Writer

A commission from the Euro-

pean Union named Pitt as a European I

Union Center for Excellence, makingit
one of . 11 US. universities to hold such
a distinction "

The University competed with
'23 other US. colleges for a three—year
grant from the EU. The grant is worth
3.42 million euros, or about $4.6 rnil—
lion.

The EU will divide the grant mon-

relations and EU policy initiatives

When the program began in 1998, -

Pitt won the first national competition

_ to host an EU studies center,and it has

retained its hosting status since then,
while some schools have lost it

Every three years, the EU evaluates
whether or not US. universities have
spent their grant money wisely Each
year Pitt was evaluated, the University
passed the test with more than average
marks

Despite economy, city

cultural district still strong

by Justin Jacobs
Co/ztributi/zg Er)£tor

The people of Pittsburgh get it The economy ,

is in the gutter. Economic woe is in the newspaper,
on TV and on the lips of anyone concerned about
where all their money just went I

One place you won’t ﬁnd the woe, though, is in
Pittsburgh’s cultural disttict, where ticket sales are
as  as ever

In fact, just last weekend, as part of the cityfs
International Festival of Firsts, the US. premiere
of BalletMa1ibor—a dance take on “Romeo and

Juliet” set to Radiohead songs — sold out the his— ’

toiic Byham Theater. Twice -

And with seats   snapped up for
upcoming local touting Broadway productions of
“Mamma Mia” and ‘jerseyBoys,”it seems like the
debt and despair  rampant on \X/all Street
hasn’t yet stiﬂed the pulse of Pittsburgh ‘ .

Or at least not the cityfs theatrical heart A

"1 have to think twice tight rrew_'1 could be
spending my money on something else, like gas,”
said Sandy Rice-Fritsch of Aspinwall. “But I love

Last year, they responded to 40 calls, one-

said.

The scene

Henderson asked students to leave the
classroom before he set up the “kill room,”
an exercise to teach them how to notice un-
usual items in their surroundings.

The students hesitantly entered the room
a few minutes later. They pointed out several
things wrong with the scene -—— a pipe bomb

' . on the ﬂoor, a strange kit on the window-
_ sill, a grenade on the piano -—— and then, one

student stepped in front'of a motion sensor
attached to the wall.

' “You’re dead,” said Henderson. The .class
laughed, but many students still seemed'hesi-
tant to patrol the room.

‘‘We’re always looking around,” said Hen-
derson. “Always scanning the area, always
moving.” ' '

The truck

\When the squad gets a call, they get a
short message on their pagers with the details
of "the situation, said Detective Fred Craw-
ford.

Then, they get in the bomb truck to re-
spond. ,

It is a 5-ton vehicle with blinding red-and-
blue flashing lights and tires that appeared
to be about 2 feet tall. Inside, the detectives
stored their bomb suits and equipment A

bot’s gun should pierce the object before
the bomb can explode. That discharges the
bomb instead of “detonating” it, as the pub-
lic often thinks bomb technicians do, said

_ Henderson.

Williams said explosions -are categorized’
based on high order —— that is, if the bomb
accomplished its purpose — and low order,
if it did not. i

He turned to the students watching the
robot and asked, “Can this area withstand a
high order detonation?” V

A couple of students asked about the

I strength of the building and the bomb be-

fore  an answer.

“The first thing ‘people think about is
construction and the size of the bomb,” said
\X/illiams. “But the answer is ‘No.’ There is
life in here.” ’ ~_

Henderson said the bomb squad’s ﬁrst
priority is to evacuate the area. But even with
a robot, one member of the team, dressed in
a 70—pound bomb suit, will have to inspect
the area where the potential bomb is locat-

_ ed.

age and it blows up,” said Crawford, 7‘the

EDITORIAL

In the nation’s most historically
signiﬁcant election, Americans will
soon choose a president to take
chatgeofanationthathaschanged
dramatically in the past eight years
Under the leadership of the Bush
administration, we have witnessed the
continual  of a weak health
care system, the deterioration of the
economy and an unnecessary, costly
and deadly war in 

It is clear that the United States
needs a-new direction

Both Sen. Barack Obama and
Sen. John McCain have claimed
to be candidates for change But
only Obama has the policies and
the outlook that can truly revitalize
America — both at home and on the
world stage

Throughout his political career,
Obama has displayed poised and
responsible leadership skills that can
serve to unite the country and put the
United States on the path to success
in an uncertain future.

Unlike McCain, Obama presents
a government—run health care plan
that would expand coverage to more
Americans Today, millions of US.
citizens are without health insurance.
Under an Obama administration,

Americans if they opt for it Because
the plan is governmer1t—run, it
will operate more efficiently than
McCain’s policy, whichwillgiveevery
fami1ya$5,000taxcreditt:o buy their

Amid the worst
economic crisis since the
Great Depression, it is
important that Americans
elect a candidate who
understands the economy
and the steps that must
be taken to ensure that
such a ﬁnancial 
will not happen 
Obama demonstrates the
best insight in ﬁnancial
policy. By surrounding
himself and cooperating ,
with economic experts, Obama can
lead the US. economy on the path to
recovery.

. When it comes to foreign
policy, the differences between
Obama and McCain are drastic.
While Obama has always opposed
thewarinIraq,warnir1gof “an
occupation of undetermined
length, with undetermined costs
and undetermined consequences,”

    

McCain aligned with Bush in
supporting the war and has stated
his willingness to keep troops in Iraq
indeﬁnitely.

’ For eight years, the Bush
administration has remained
 in its opposition to 

'? 1 
to America’s world foes Obama,
however,haspromisedtoclrangetl1is
He has emphasized the importance
of meeting with global leaders In
a world  closer and closer to

globalization, a diplomatic policy’

that opens the doors to discussion
also opens the doors to opportunity
and global progress It will forge

The Pitt News endorses Barack Obama for president

On energy and the environment,
Obarna’s policy will make the United
Statesaﬁontrunnerin climatechange
While both candidates now support

the need for a comprehensive energy
plan, one that includes measures
for alternative energy
methods He will
implement a capand—
trade program that will
auction all pollution
credits and invest the
proceeds in energy
reform programs that
will guide the United
States to a cleaner,
greener future

During Bush’s
two terms in ofﬁce,
America’s 
abroad has worsened dramatically.
ThewarsinIraqandAfghanistan, the
Abu Ghraib controversy and Bush’s
refusal to engage in diplomacy have
fueled anti—Americanism throughout

popularity in Europe was a hopeful
sign that the United States can shed
the negative  ﬁieled by eight
years of failed foreign policy.

But the Obama appeal is not
restricted to Europe, however. The
New York Trrnes columnist Thomas
Friedman wrote that people in the
Middle East were also 
“Obama—mania.” Obama’s
nomination, Friedman wrote, shows
“how much many foreigners  still
hunger for the ‘idea of America’ —
this open, optimistic and, indeed,
revolutionary place so radically
different from their own societies”

That open, optimistic place
is precisely the America Obama

done it alone

In this manner, affirmative action
does nothing to alleviate, and might
even entrench, racist attitudes in this
nation If minorities advance with
no outside help, then there can be
no doubt or question that they have
advanced based on their own merits
When this merit is recognized as such,
a small chunk of the  facade of
racismiis broken— when somebody

not because of his skin He sure does
a better job than you do.

The second problem with afﬁr-
rnative action, especially’ in the realm
of college admissions, is that it sets
people up for failure It is implicit in
giving someone an advantage that that
person is not as qualiﬁed as someone
of a different race Otherwise, the af-
ﬁrrnative action would not be neces-
sary, as the person would be admitted
on qualiﬁcarion alone, and the entire

question of race is wholly irrelevant
Finally, the central tenet of afﬁr—
rnative action — that we are compen-
sating for past discrimination — leads
to all sorts of difﬁcult questions Who
gets these privileges? If past discrirni—
nation is a qualiﬁer for present afﬁr-
mative action, then the Irish, Poles,
Germans,]ews, Catholics, Anabaptists
and other previously aggrieved white
people could  Now, I realize dis-

crimination was not as severe toward

these groups as toward other racial rni- .

norities, but how do we  that
difference? ‘ T

One could argue it isn’t fair to help
some previously aggrieved groups
and not others. It is easier to avoid the
question altogether.

This isnot to say that the gov-
ernment should do nothing to help
disadvantaged minorities It’s ‘just that
the real solutions lie elsewhere There

should be rigid enforcement of anti-
discrimination statutes, to ensure that

everyone has an equal chance at suc— I

secondary education, providing more

P theEditor

Dear Editor,

The bias shown in Tuesday’s editorial, “Palin’s trooper troubles,” is disap-
pointing. Although I agree that any person running for a public ofﬁce should
be scrutinized, I must also point out that they should be given a fair and
impartial review. This is something numerous political candidates have not
received from the media lately. The snide remarks throughout the editorial
reﬂect that The Pitt News, too, is included. K

Lines such as, “Perhaps Palin doesn’t know the meaning of the word un-
ethical,” may be true. But perhaps The Pitt News doesn’t know the meaning
of the word “unbiased.” The accusations you make might all be valid, but is
she not innocent until proven guilty? The point of your editorials should be
to supply material and let the reader make their own opinions based on the
given information.

Dear Editor,

In response to Steve Kaszycki’s letter about Pitt’s sexual health rating and his concerns about free
condoms, Student Health does not hand out free condoms in mass quantities. So it can hardly be said
that Pitt has a “free condom program” as implied by Kaszycki. There are some student groups that
provide free condoms, but that is the prerogative of each group, most of which are led by under-
graduates — not administrators. Even where free condoms are available, it is most often up to the
student to take the initiative and obtain them. This is still teaching students to take responsibility for
their sexual health, even if they don’t need to pay for condoms.

Kaszycki stated that college students need to learn responsibility. Though we pay for most of our
meals, we greatly appreciate it when we occasionally get one for free. I believe the same is true of
most students and condoms. There is nothing irresponsible about taking advantage of a free meal or
a free condom. The irresponsible choice is to use no protection at all and to engage in unsafe sexual
practices.

Kaszycki’s assertion that “a better measure of sexual health is commitment to single sexual part-
ners” shows remarkable ignorance of the plethora of lifestyles practiced not only by college students,
but also by other responsible adults. Many very responsible people practice serial monogamy, keeping
one partner for a length of time that might be as short as a few days, during which they are sexually
exclusive. This is to say nothing of polyamory, in which one person may have multiple seriously com-
mitted romantic and sexual partners and engage in responsible sexual practices with all of them. Peo-
ple in any situation should practice safer sex, which for many includes condoms or other barriers.

Dear Editor,

In response to Tony ]ovenitti’s article, “Penguins cut through discounted
-ticket plan,” in yesterday’s issue, I understand the frustration of students
who wish there were more student rush tickets available, but the “I need my
Sidney” whines need to stop. ‘

First of all, the Pens training camp practices and scrimmages were open
to the public (other numerous practices throughout the season are open,
too). Second, the arena opened up to the public for viewing one of the
NHL premiere games. Third, student rush was added for yesterday’s game
against the Philadelphia Flyers and for Thursday’s game against the Wash-
ington Capitols, in addition to the other four regular season games. It’s likely
that other games will become available as the date gets closer, especially the
weekday games. i

I don’t blame them for trying to sell as many tickets as possible at actual
cost. It is still a business and not some school sport that caters to students.
The Penguins are having great success,  we should be grateful they bother
to set aside any tickets for way below cost. Enjoy the games and stop com-
plaining. Go Pens. A '

Dear Editor,

Steve Kaszycki’s letter displays astounding ignorance about the consequences of STDs and the
usefulness of providing condoms to sexually active individuals. He claims that by receiving free con-
doms, Pitt students are abandoning responsibility for their choices. Making something convenient
and free for students hardly implies that they will not be responsible in procuring these items at
another time. ‘

His statement that “we allow students to fail academically when they make poor choices, so let’s
permit them to. fail sexually” is callous and ignores the fact that universities provide resources for
students, should they choose to use them, to ensure academic success. Much like office hours or
writing centers, having condoms available gives students another tool to act responsibly. Addition-
ally, when a student fails academically, it does not affect the broader community, while the spread of
STDS certainly does. P ,

Lastly, we would like to point out the inaccuracy of Kaszycki’s claim that the best measure of
sexual health is to have only one partner. \While any health professional  tell you that a monoga-
mous relationship between uninfected partners is the safest sex, this is not the only way to be healthy.
Condoms are an effective way to preserve one’s sexual and reproductive health, and we hope that
Kaszycki will realize that providing them to college students is simply a way to contribute to their
well-being.

 Swedish
 B ;t Blackstrap’s new al-
 /‘*3 bum Steal A/I} Horses
 and R1172 is the musical
equivalent of a painting with no
focal point — there isn’t anything
especially bad about it, but it’s not
spectacular enough to hang over a
fireplace.

Blackstrap strives for gritty
pop rock on its sophomore al-
bum, Steal My H arm‘ and R1172. The
album’s songs are good, but not
great. It’s background music rather

     

than something to really sit down
and listen to.

Some tracks fail to fully draw
in listeners with catchy choruses
and big hooks. Maybe this is what
Blackstrap wanted —— rebellion
against the countless other bands
that alter its songs to something
more radio friendly.

While this is admirable, the
album might leave listeners itch-
ing for something that leaves a bit
more of an impact.

Lately, Sweden has practically
become synonymous with “up and
coming,” and Blackstrap certainly
found its place among the slew of
fresh talent constantly emerging
from the countryfs chilly depths.

 Harm walks a dangerous line of sound-

ing homogenous. If it weren’t for the contin-
uous turn—taking between Linden and Westh
for lead vocals, many of the tracks -would
sound exactly the same. \While the ballads
aren’t bad, they don’t leave a whole lot of
resonance.

“Still Sore,” though an exception to the
aforementioned monotony as the album’s
only acoustic track, seems almost out of
placein its delicacy. Even Linden’s vocals
can’t rescue this skippable track.

Blackstrap recorded Steal My Horses and
Run in Amsterdam m 2006, but it wasn’t
until the spring of this year that the album
ﬁnally made its way overseas. The band will
follow its album and begin its North Ameri-
can tour, which includes a stop in Pittsburgh
on Oct. 19.

it would be too freezing. It was an intense pe-
riod. Most of the songs were written during the
summer and fall, and then we started record-
ing in late fall/ early winter. We recorded our
basic tracks live in the studio. Did some over-
dubs. We recorded mine and Maria’s vocals in
my apartment in Stockholm by ourselves. Our
friend Sebastian Forslund produced and mixed
the record together with me. It took a very long
time until I got satisﬁed with the mix. Almost
half a year, so it was a relief when the record
finally was done.

TPN: Sweden has been exporting a lot of

JW: I think Sweden has an old tradition of
getting kids into music. We all had to do some
music during school, and almost everyone
picked up an instrument (for a while) and took
lessons that were supported by the Swedish

Basketball stars come to Pittsburgh

Celtics beat Cavaliers in exhibition

by Adarn Littman
Senior Staﬂ Wrt'ter

Pittsburgh, the Cleveland Cavaliers
want to be your NBA team.

They don’t want to move here, but
it seems theywouldverymud1lil<eif
you’d consider pledging your fandom
to them.

Tuesday night; the Cavaliers played
their fourth preseason game in the past
ﬁve years in Pittsburgh, but for the
first time, the game took place at the

‘Petersen Events Center Every other

time, the team played at Mellon Arena.
This year, Cleveland faced the defend-
ing champion Boston Celtics

The Cavaliers tried their hardest
to make it a home game, as Cleveland
is only about two hours away from
Pittsburgh They brought along their
mascot, Moondog, their cheerlead-

Crump mentioned the team, they
weren’t “the Cleveland Cavaliers,” but
“your Cleveland Cavaliers” At one
point he wanted the fans to cheer for
their hometown team, but felt it nec-
essary to include the current town the
team was playing in by saying: “Come
on Pittsburgh, Pa, cheer for your
hometown team.’ " -—

The game didn’t sell out, like many
men’s games at the Pete since it opened
in 2002, but a majority of the 12,500
seats in the arena were ﬁlled It was a
calmer side of the Petersen Events
Center, without one overwhelming
 interest or the Oakland Zoo to
create the loud frenzy associated with
basketball games that take place at the
arena.

Those who went saw a close game,
with the Celtics  90-86. Le-

and Ray Allen both played more than
20. Gamett scored 11 points and had
seven rebounds, while Pierce netted
14, and Allen scored 15. Leon Powe
led Boston with 17 points and 
a layup attempt by Vernon Hamil-
ton with about four seconds left that
would’ve tied the game at 88.

Even though _it was  a

( Iaval1ers' homegame,Pittwas featured '

predominately throughout the night.
Around the arena and in the team
store at the front entrance of the build-
ing, a few Cleveland items could be
purchased, but Panther gear was still
much more prevalent Two of the
biggest receptions of the night came
from  Pitt coachjamie Dixon
and the men’s and women’s basketball
teams on the big screen, with Dejuan
Blair getting the loudest reaction when

Pitt defeats Youngstown State

by Randy Lieberman
' Staff W/rite/'

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
beat Youngstown State at the Fitzger-
ald Field House Tuesday night, 3-1,
to avoid a potential letdown loss and
springboard the team into its rivalry
match on Fiiday against West Vir-
girlie

Senior Kelly Campbell, named the
Big East Player of the Week for her ef-
fortin last weekend’s twrrgame sweep,
led all players with a season—high 26
kills and added 14  for her ninth
double—double of the season

Campbell tallied 38 kills over the
weekend and leads the team with 103
in conference play. She led the Pan-
thers (13—8, 5-1) with 22 kills in a 3-1
win against Notne Dame on Sunday
and 16 kills against DePaul Saturday.

“It was great,” said Campbell of
 the honor

It was Campbell’s ﬁrst time 
named Big East Player of the Week

Coach Toby Rens lauded Camp-
bell’s achievements as well.

“Kelly was outstanding over the
weekend and probably better tonight,’ ’
said Rens. “She hit .490 for the match,

5» .

and that’s exceptional, especially be-
ing a rniddle—hitter and often facing a
double block.”

Senior Jessica Moses added to
Campbell’s doubledigit kill count with
12, along with junior Meagan Dooley
with 11 and sophomore Amy Town
with 14.

Pitt won the dose—fought match
against Youngstown State, overcom-
ing a different style of play than usual.

“This team is a very different style
than were accustomed to in our Big
East games,” said Rens “They tend
to exploit the corners and throw a lot
more, and we had trouble adjusting to
that at ﬁrst”

The women’s volleyball team’s ren-
dition of the Backyard Brawl kicks off
this Fiiday at 7 pm. at the Fitzgerald
Field House.

The win would extend Pitt’s slim
lead in the Big East against a Moun-
taineers squad thatis winless in the Big
East so far.

‘We certainly have to come to
play, its a big  and a conference
match,” said Rens “It’s all about 

one win closer to  the regular-
season championship and

for the conference tournament”

Campbell agreed with her coach.

“We want to be the hardest work-
ing team in the Big East,” said Carnp—
bell “If we accomplish that goal, it
will put us in good position to con-
tend for the Big East regular—season
championship, qualifying for the Big
East tournament and then the NCAA
Tournament.”

The Panthers won their match
with scores of 25-21, 25-19 and 25-23,
losing the third set, 22-25.

The Penguins tied the score at
13 in the fourth and final set. The
Panthers used a 4-2 run capped by a
Youngstown tip to make the score 19-
15 and force a Penguins timeout.

Campbell recorded her second
ace of the match out of the timeout
Later, Campbell recorded the final
two kills to give the Panthers a 25-21
victory in the game and a 3-1 Victory
in the match.

Unlike the majority of Pitt’s rnatch—
es this year, it was outblocked, 114.

Are you suffering from Bulimia Nervosa?

 

The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center announces a new clinical psychotherapy

champs, the Celtics

Although the crowd mostiy favored the Cava-
liers, the Celtics certainly weren’t underrepresent-

It certainly didn’t have the feeling of a Pitt— t

Georgetown game as far as the crowd goes, but
the players on both sides showed some

tempt by Anderson Varejao out of bounds and
proceeded to yell at him. Varejao looked toward
Garnett, and the two came nose-to—nose They
exchanged words that probably weren’t tips on
hair styling, where to buy pants for extremely tall
men or what to order at the 0 after the game

\When Garnett left the court after the next
substitution, he was greeted with a loud cheer
from the fans, as he was most of the night. Along
with James, Garnett was  the most popular
player on the court, in terms of fan reaction and
jerseys worn to the game

a “I thoughtwe were received well,” said Cleve-
landcoachl\/IikeBrown.“Theiansseemedtoget
a kick out of the game, and that’s what you want
[when you play at a neutml site] .”

Brown, along with Varejao, thought playing
in Pittsburgh was an opportunity for the team to
help extend its fan base

“It was a great experience,” said Varejao

Possibly the biggest reaction from the crowd
appeared when Moondog came out during a

until he took off thejersey to reveal a Steelers
shirt.

"The Cleveland-Pittsburgh  is deﬁnitely
