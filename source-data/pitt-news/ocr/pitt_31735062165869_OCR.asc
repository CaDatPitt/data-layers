 Studies Deferred
Rush, New Rush Rules _

_, « _ By VIJAY «JAIN

The question of switching to deferred rush was the main
issue on the agenda of the Interfraternity Council last week.

Bob Byran,‘ who investigated the matter, presented his
report before I_F. The report presented quotes from deans of
other institutions that had transferred from_ immediate rush
as at ‘the University to deferred rush, The ﬁnancial aspect
was also noted in the report and ﬁgures su'pported_the thesis
that deferred rush will not result in loss of revenues for the
fraternal organizations. A ~

Anti-Parking Meter
Campaign Underway .

The Pitt News-sponsored

petition campaign against the.

installation of additional parking meters in the Oakland area

‘will begin today with the distribution of petitions for all stu-

dents and interested faculty members to sign.

Booths will be set uplat the SU desk, at the student desk‘
CL, at the Scaife Hall desk, and in Engineering Hall. The

booths will be open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day and. will
be manned by representatives of the various student organi-
zations supporting The Pitt News in this campaign;

‘ Booths Remain Open

Matthew Swetonic, news

stated that “the booths will re-9
main open until every student—‘

both graduate and undergraduate
——has had an opportunityvto sign
the petitions in opposition to the
proposed City ordinance.” ,
The petition, as preparedby
Swetonic, Matthew Nesvisky,
editor-in-chief of The Pitt
News, and Peter Bijur, Student
~(_;}overnment A Parking Commit-
tee chairman, states that:
“Whereas the University of
Pittsburgh is the largest trafﬁc
generator in Oakland and
“Whereas the students and fac-
ulty members of the University
have a more legitimate reason for

parking ‘all day in the area than

other all-day parkers who use
the Oakland district for free park-
ing and travel to other parts of
town for the day and
“Wheieas limited time park'-
ing would be unfeasible for
most daytime students and fac-
ulty members and '
“Whereas the installation of two

and-four hour parking meters in
Schenley Plaza, Bigelow Blvd.,

editorof The Pitt News, has

 

rules.to suit the change over. An elaborate and lengthy dis-

cussion followed the presentation
of the report. ’

In answed to a question from
Mark Bebko, IF president, Ery-

J an stated that colleges similar

_ to the University on deferred
and immediate ‘rush had not re-
plied to questionaires sent to-
them about the relative merits
of the two systems. -

Bryan 1 stressed that. freshmen

could not be oriented to both
the fraternity and his studies.
“Often parents ‘of the freshmen
hold them back till they can pro-
duce grades, and they themselves
are afraid of taking this step.”
‘On the Other Hand’ ,

“On the other hand, it could
either rejuvenate us or kill us
ﬁnancially. The smaller will get
smaller and the big will get big-
ger. Possibly, cliques _may get
formed.”

Nick Antonichio said. “We
can’t afford to have these guys
look at us for a trimester. We
have to take them into our'fold'
and mold them to our way. We
have a bad reputation. on the
campus.”

Bebko asked the representatives
to take the proposal back to their
houses,-’ discuss it and come pre-
pared for further discussion at

Student Government voted
to support the parking peti-
tion proposed by The Pitt
News at Thursday’s meeting.
Peter Bijur, chairman of the
parking committee, explained
to the senators the circumstances
surrounding the petitions. “The
era of free parking is over. The

public street is not a garage,”
.Bijur said.

“City Council’s major reason
for proposing ‘parking meters in
the Oakland campus is not
revenue, but the poor turnover of

. ears in unmctered areas,” continu-

ed Bijur. Most or the meters

would operate on a two hour basis - I
and all would require five cents,

per half-hour according to the
Council proposal.

Administrative Backing
“We have the administration
behind us in our attempt to lower
the rate and raise the time limit,”
Bijur concluded.

Chooses Emblem

.The Student Organization of
the Graduate Library Science
School ‘has passed a new con-
stitution and has chosen a school
emblem. ~

The constitution, according to
Ronald Wiley, head of Student
Relations, freezes the existing
practices of the organization. The
new emblem is a variation of the
University Seal, with the words
“Graduate Library School” be-
low ‘the shield.

The group has also decided to
hold a series of informal semin-
ars, beginning next week. Three
or four groups of two faculty
members and ﬁve or ten students
will meet at noon for lunch and

the Student Seminar Committee.

 

 

 

 

ons. However, with new advances
in science, “Atomic” was changed
to “American.”
The main concern of the fed-
_eration, as stated by Dr. Janis
is “withthe social and political
concerns of science. We try to
inform the public, as, well‘ as
Congress, of the scientific basis
of problems that come up before-
the public eye. _

“We make public" statements
and recommendations to Congress
and to the public as to what we
feel should be done as well ‘as
explain the scientiﬁc basis behind
this.” -

Commuter Disgusted

By Meter Proposal

Editor, The Pitt News: ‘
The proposal to install park-
ing meters in the vicinity of
th e University of Pittsburgh
may seem to be the answer to
0akland’s parking problems. In

‘my opinion, however, it will

only be the beginning of a ser-
ies of problems which the ad-
ministration and those students
who commute by automobile
‘will have to face.

As a commuter,.I would like
the answers to the following
questions: ‘

Who will supply the nickels
to feed the parking meters?

Who will supply the time
needed to run from the Univer-
sity to a meter and back to
class?

These questions should have
been asked and resolved long
before the parking meter pro-
posal reached the development
stage. The parties who recom-
mended the establishment of
these hellish slot machines have
shown the commuter no con-
sideration whatsoever in this
important matter.

One of these conspirators, Mr.
Katsur, has expressed his opin-
ion on the proposal. His opin-
ion disgusts me. Mr. Katsur
states_ that enough facilities ex-
ist to accommodatemthose wish-
ing all-day parking in the Oak-
land area.

But is his opinion- an unbiased
one? As the owner of six park-
ing lots in the district, the stu-

The

  

A I =-Lu
Om of Ammm'nH Grew

dents’ ﬁnancial loss would be his
gain. If Mr. Katsur will allow
students to park in his lots‘at
no cost, or if the University/ will
supply parking facilities, I will
support the proposal for addi-
tional parking meters.

After receiving three ﬁnes for
overtime « parking while attend-
ing classes, I have acquired a
strong dislike forthe mayor and
police ‘officers of this City.

Whether this antipathy spreads-

to the administration will de-
pend on their policy concerning
the establishment of parking
meters in the vicinity of the
University campus.

It's The Cat's Paiamas . ..

Four-Legged Nudists

G. Clifford Prout, Jr., president of the Society
for Indeeeney to Naked Animals, has been bom-
barding this newspaper office with propaganda for
his organization. Among hisleaﬂets, newspaper
tear-sheets, news releases and
sheet music is a cryptic note in
which Prout states: “I will be on
your campus to organize a Stu-
dent SINA Chapter during
March. Would appreciate your
mentioning this.”

It is unknown whether or not
Prout will campaign» at the Uni-
versity. It is also unknown
whether or not Prout and his
50,000 ca_rd-carrying supporters
(his ﬁgures) actually constitute .
an actual, serious organization. It is known, how-
ever, that in every interview to (late, Prout has

never cracked a smile about the purposelof‘ his-

group and most newspapers have been treating

SINA as a genuine, ‘if somewhat odd, movement.
In brief, the Society for Indecency to Naked

Animals advocates stamping out animal nudity.
Pushing this campaign because “Decency To-

day Means Morality Tomorrow,” SINA links the ,

sight of naked animals to most of the country’s

major ills. Indiscreet beasts are a contributing
«factor to our suicide and alcoholism rates as well

as juvenile delinquency, adult crime, and the Beat
Generation, Prout said in San Francisco last sum-
mer. _
Doggie Skirts? , c ,
His non-profit organization, which was found-
ed by his father four years ago, is based in New
York and has several unique activities. SINA, for
example, will. happily send ‘ patterns, for doggie
skirts, cow bikinis, and elephant trousers to any
blushingapet-owner who requests them..Prout also
claims that “Sina has 14 dmergency clothesmobiles
spotted around the U.S. to rushlinto -any area
where animal morality is low.” And one of -their
neatest tricks is issuing a “summons” ~to'~ owners of
nude quadrupeds: A

L “This summons has been issued" by ia-',qualiﬁ_ed
SINA oﬁicer .and (or) member in goodstanding

for your violation of Article II of the SINA CON-

STITUTION for appearing in public with a naked,

cat, dog, horse, cow or any domestic animal_~£th_a‘t
stands higher than four inches or is longer than six
inches.

 

By Matthew ‘ Nesvisky

“The SINA CONSTITUTION requires that you
answer this summons in person or through a sworn
statement before the Executive Board of SINA, the
Society for Indecency to Naked Animals, withing
ten days after issuance, setting forth a complete
explanation of your actions.

 

.  - . . . 7-x-~.
‘ “If this summons IS ignored then In the name‘:

of decency you shall be deemed unworthy of ever
appearing on the SINA membership rolls and, if
you are presently enrolled, you shall be forthwith
and also permanently expelled from our organiza-
tion without delay or prejudice.

“In accordance with rules and regulations pre-
scribed by our SINA CONSTITUTION, I. G. Clif-
ford Prout, hereby do affix. my seal and my signa-
ture.” A A

This statement -is _ accofrdingly followed by
Prout’s‘ super—pretentious signature and his seal,
which is a carefully designed black blob. Prout
claims that he handed such a summons to a
mounted cop in New York's Central Park for rid-
ing a nookid hoss after the cop had tried to tag
Prout for holding a rally without a permit.

Prout made the front pages last week when
some of his followeds picketed the White House
with, the _ two-foldivpurpose of .“adhering to the
President’s physical. ﬁtness program” and “protest-
ing against Mrs. Kennedy and daughter Caroline
for riding nude horses.”

the world’s’ sha-me_less animals - remains doubtful, -

b however, because of theidoubtful logic which moti-

vates his organization: he believes that all animals
have a buil.t-in sense ‘of modesty and-' that-7 they
prefer to wear clothes,’ and that our. children must
be “protected”ifr'om the sight of animal exhibition-
ism. , , ,. -\
If Prout, who has promised to’ visit the Uni-

’_ versity this month, is pulling oﬁ a vast joke with

his o1‘ganization,"I’ll belly-laugh along with him.
But if he is really serious (which I want to doubt,
although he has given no indication of being any-

’thing,but serious), then I must control my laugh-

ter and view this man as unparalleled fear, and
ignorance on two feet, trying to clotheeverything
on four.

Election in Restrospect . . .

Ineffective Campaigning  

Nearly 1500 students voted in the Student Gov-
ernment elections. This ﬁgure represents a con-
siderable improvement over last year. Yet, con-
sidering this and the fact that SG has not had time
to reach full stature in the minds '
of many students, the election .
results were not as high as they
should have been. Perhaps the 4
major "reason is the ineffective- A
ness of the campaigns.

Early-— planning and the per-
sonal approach should head the 

After speaking to many students, _=
I have found the consensus to be, ,
that both techniques were almost ’
totally lacking. ‘ A

Signs were not put up and_ presidential plat-
forms were not mentioned until a week and a half
before the election. Campaign literature beganto
dribble off the press at the same time, but it was
not well distributed. » ' 0‘
Some Life lniected

The election atmosphere was quiet and ‘rather
dead until The Pitt News editorial urging a split
ticket injected some life Into it. Then the ﬁreworks
began. But it was too late. '

 

From that time on the campaign took on a more

personal aspect, but there also appeared a some-
what frantic, last-minute drive for votes -- a cycle
of cause and effect, recrimination and retaliation.
Judy Diethorn, present SG vice-president, sent out
a letter endorsing Martin Landy, but few copies
were available. Both presidential. candidates spoke
to fraternities and sororities Monday night, but
“Greeks” compose less than a third of the students,

leaving the rest unapproached.

TA list of Able Party candidates and qualiﬁca-

tions appeared Tuesday. It was an excellent idea
. but should -have «been . done earlier ,and-' distributed,

better. That same night, party candidates tele-
phoned commuters to get out the vote.

Election 'morning brought ‘a batch of Bijur
circulars denying “ridiculous rumors” that Bijur
was anti-Greek and favored abolishing Greek Week.

The average student walked to the polls without
seeing most of the campaign literature and knew
little aboutany of the candidates. Handbills urging

' a vote for a particular candidate were lying on
. tables near the polls, and were actually distributed

with -the "ballot by a “non-partisan”-‘manning the
polls at Engineering Hall during lunch. ’

V The average voter was not familiar enough with B"
-the liberal arts candidates to vote for 12. ’ Not all of

the pictures were posted at the polls, through no

fault of the candidates, however.

Even; though the candidates did not campaign
actively enough on their own, other factors not
under the control acted against them. "Signs read-
ing “Vote for Steve, Bijur” were posted; in the
Nurses’ Residence. Several names were mis-
spelled on the ballot, also.

QPA Misunderstonding , T,

There seemed to be considerable niisunde1'stand-
ing about the quality point average qualiﬁcation= for
senators. A 2.5 QPA is required.‘ Several names

7 were crossed off the ballot, supposedly for failure

to meet this requirement. Why didn’t the iOﬁ'ici,es

of Dean of Women and the Dean of Men check the

candidate’s QPA’s before the ballots were printed?

Imagine the consternation of an L. A. sena-
torial candidate who was told the night before the
election that she was ineligible because of her QPA.
By the time that she found. out she was eligible,
her picture had been torn up.

Only 29 percent of the students voted. Most of
the fault ‘lay in the conduction of campaigns. More
must be said to »more people. But election pro.
cedure must also be improved next year if we are

BALLERINA Marta Becket takes a blister break during Midday.

Mime Charms Midday
With Original Style.

, By ‘KATHIE EDWARDS

Marta Becloet, ballet dancer and mime, completely
charmed her audience, small though it was, at Wednesday’s
Midday Series program in Stephen Foster Memorial. _.

Miss Becket’s highly original style of dancing combined
expert pantomime with the grace of, ballet to create a de-
lightfully humorous and yet tender mode of expression.

_ ‘Curtain Raiser’

The performance began with
“Curtain Raiser,” in which Miss
Becket portrayed three charac-
ters: Columbine, Harlequin, and
Pierrot. This dance concerned the
“eternal triangle,” but _was still
light and gay throughout.

Miss Becket then performed‘

“Divertissement,”. a classical_
ballet dance of the Romantic
period, skillfully executed to
the music of Chopin. “La
,Grande Performance” followed,
in which she portrayed a baller-
ina of the Degas era, preparing
for her great‘ solo in, the opera
Faust. Expert technique and
humorous , pantomime again
were again evident.

A classic court dance of Spain,
“Cancion Triste,” held the ‘spot-
light next. Miss Becket incorpo-
rated ballet with ease into the
‘strong Spanish ﬂavor of the dance,
complete with clicking castenets
and stamping feet. “Gossip” fol-
lowed, with Miss Becket again
portraying three ‘people- This
time, she _became two women. gos-
sips and a “scarlet” cabaret
dancer. This dance sketch showed
excellent use of characterizing de-
tails and was full of satiric humor.

I Czech Folk, Dance

“Slavonic Dance” was a highly
variation of an old
Czechoslovakian _folk dance, done
to the music of Dvorak.

’After a. brief" intermission,

Miss ‘Becket returned to the

A
T

from a storyby Maxim Gorky.
‘In this work, the emphasisiwas
not on footwork as much "as it
was on the emotions expressed
through’ her hands and facial
movements.

Miss Becket’s major work, “The
Mirror, the Carpet, and the
Lemon,” a Turkish fairy tale, con-
cluded the program. The choreog-
raphy, costuming, set designing,
and story/were all originated by
the dancer, using,Ethnic, Turkish,
Hindu, and Chinese music. She
portrayed’ the nine characters in
her fairy tale quite cleverly and
with undeniable skill.

General’s Ankle Remains Questionable 1

Cagers Confident AboutBig Game

By JIM O'BRIEN

PHILADELPHIA Bas-
ketball coach Bob Timmons
left,the Sheraton Hotel last
night at 11 o'clock and took a
long walk down Pennsylvania
Boulevard here. He said he
wanted to walk for a while; then
he would go back to the hotel and
play some gin later.

Timmons said- he was not
worrying about tonight's NCAA
basketball game with New York
University at the Penn Palestra at
6 p.m. ,

“All the thinking is done,” said
Timmons. “We formulated our
plan ahead of time. So I won't
h a v e a n y problems tonight.
They’ll all come tomorrow night.”

Relaxed and Confident

Timmons said his team was not
overwrought about tonight’s game
either. “They‘re pretty relaxed

about it,” he said. “They’re pretty
confident, too. This club’s never
got too overawed by anyone we
played.” ,

Most of his players stayed in
their hotel rooms last night and
watched TV. A few went to the
movies. They had an 11:30 p.m.
curfew.

Earlier in the evening —- at 7
p.m. — the team had a light drill
at the Palestra. There was no
contact in the workout, probably
because Dave Roman was injured
on that floor the night before the
Temple game and could not play
against the Owls. I

Take No Chances

“We just did a little shooting
and a little running,” Timmons
said. “We weren’t going to tempt
Provi_dence.” Hetﬁgured he had
enough grief after worrying about
the physical condition of Brian
Gencralovich.

“The better General runs. the

better we look,” he said. “We’ve
got to battle NYU on the boards.
They get a lot of tap-ins. They
just put it up and go after it.
They’re a real strong inside ball
club. That's why we need the
General. we need his rebound-
ing strength. He’ll give us some
authority in there.”

Timmons said NYU was ready
to go, too. “They feel pretty con-
fident,” he said. “They're highly
incensed because the magazines
have conceded Duke the Eastern
Regional championship and have
them in Louisville already. They
have a p r e t t y _good opinion of
themselves. V

Scouted By Timmons

Timmons justified their feelings
when he read some excerpts from
his scouting report when he saw
them play St. John’s last Thurs-
day night in New York. .

“People in New York had
been pretty high on them be-

fore Fordham' "knocked them
off," he said.‘ “Fordham ended
up winning the city champion-
ship. They’ve won’ nine straight .
since we beat them.”
NYU will probably play a man-
to-man defense against the Pan-

thers tonight, according to Tim-

mons, and this could mean
trouble. Four of the ﬁve teams
that have beaten the [Panthers this
winter have used that kind of a
defensive set-up. West Virginia
was the only zone-defense team
that won.

Timmons’ team is not highly
concerned about this, however.
They have other plans for today.
They had breakfast at 10 a.m.
They will have their pre-game
meal at 3 p.m. and a meeting will
follow.

They they will leave the hotel

at 4:30 p.m. heading for, the Pal--

estra-where 9,800 people will see
how their plan works out.

avenged his only loss of the season by whipping Penn State’s

pound finals. The Panther captain
was at his season's best in the
semi-ﬁnals, where he trounced
Gary Sirota of Syracuse, 6-1, and
the ﬁnals, as he ﬁnally took the

title that had eluded him for two
years. .

Mike Johnson and Ken Barr
were not as fortunate in‘ the finals.
Johnson, after beating Bethe]

Greenhalgh of Syracuse in the

l30—pound semi-ﬁnals, 4-3, was
the victim of a brilliant perform-
ance by Lehigh’s defending cham-
pion Pat Smartt and “lost 5-3.
Smartt won on riding time, as he
rode Johnson for the entire sec-
ond period.
Barr Tires
Barr, at 177-pounds, looked-far

 
 

5-1, in the 167-9-

better than he did in dua1—meet.s
at l91—pounds, but tired badly
after taking a 4-0 first period lead
and was pinned in overtime by
Navy’s Gerry Franzen.

Frank 0‘Korn, John Carr and
Tim Gay took thirds at 137, 147
and 157-pounds, respectively.
0'Korn was eliminated in the
semi-ﬁnals by champion Mike
Harman, but came back to win
two consolation bouts.

Carr and Gay did’ the same,
with Carr losing to champion
Mike Natvig of Army and Gay to

runnerup Dave Carey of Navy.
Gay's third-place wasquite a feat
considering that the tourney was

 

 

his first varsity appearance. _

Duff Killian, at 123-pounds and
Lee Britten, at 191-pounds both
lost to the eventual champions in
the first round. Killian lost to Bill
Merriam of Lehigh and Britten to
Bob Radar of Rutgers. Killian
came back to win one consolation
match.

Jeff Ware bowed to runnerup
Ed Scharer of Rutgers in the
second round after getting a
bye. Jim Nance of Syracuse was
heavyweight champion.

Lehigh’s Kirk Pendleton won
the 157-pound title for the third
straight year and the outstanding
wrestler trophy for the second
straight time.

Rossini has said, “Harold Hairston and Barry Kramer’ will each average 25 points
a game. We’ll depend on the rest of the team. .to get out another 30 points each time. And
then we’ll hold the opposite to 79.”

So far this season this formula
has worked true to Rossini’s pre-
diction. All-American Kramer has
been averaging 29.2 ppg. and
Hairston 25.1. '
.The defense
has been doing
its job, limiting
opponents to
under the 79
point total.

Since his re-
turn after be-
i n g sidelined
by , scholastic

ties, Hairston
has been aver-
aging over 30 points a game.
While he was out, NYU was just
another team. His return has put
them among the top ten teams in

 

Barry Kramer

the country with a '17-3 mark.

although therest of the team
is scoring 30 points a. game,
NYU is basically a two-man
ballclub. The players look for
Kramer and Hairston all the
time. These two take well over
half of NYU’s shots.

NYU’s two starting guards, Neil

O'Neil and Steve Jordan, ‘are like .

their countreparts at Cincinnati
and Duke. Both pass oﬁ to the
big men up front and only shoot
on fast breaks or when they have
the good shot.
Guards Score, Too

Jordan has averaged 10.6 ppg,
and O’Neil, 7.5. The other starter,
forward Bob Williams is the only

senior in the starting lineup. The _

6-foot-4, 210-pounder has averag-
ed 10.9 for the Violets.

Both teams have players av.
eraging in. double ﬁgures, Pitt
with ﬁve and NYU with four.
The Panthers, however, play
more as a_ team and do not
count on individuals as much
as their oponents. This was evi-
denced throughout the year as
six different players led the
scoring.

[Tom'ght’s contest will be aired
in Pittsburghtover station WIIC,

‘Hairston has answered the Viol-
ets’ prayer for a big man..“I-Iap-
Dy” is 6-‘foot-7, three inches taller
than any of his teammates. -

With Brian Generalovich still
not in top shape physically, the
rebounding burden rests with
Paul Krieger. While Krieger led
the Panthers in rebounding‘ this

season, many of his rebounds
were grabbed while the (General
had “cleared out” under the
boards.

Coach Bob Timmons has said,
“Dave Roman has made it a lot
easier _on the big men under the
boards. The opposition can’t leave
him alone. But it will take a team
effort to win. Bad ankle or not,
the General must play a good

game.”

Coach Harry Litwack -of Tem-
ple says that guard Dave Roman
will be the ditference. with ‘his

Park, Md., may be a reality if
Generalovich and Roman can off-
set NYU’s twin-scorers.

Tangle for IM‘ Crown

Stars Upset Previously Unbeaten Buckeyes;
ﬂluniors Outlast MBA, 67-47, Delta Sigs, 59-52

The Dental freshmen All-Stars meet the Dental Juniors
in the Intramuralchampionship basketball game Wednes-

 day at Fitzgerald Field House. The Juniors defeated the ‘MBA,

67-47, and Delta Sigma Phi, 59-52, to gain the ﬁnals berth.
The All-Stars earned the right to play against the Juniors
by upsetting the powerful Buckeyes, 66-52. 1'

According to Ed Rosenberry,°
several. new rules will_ be used
in Wednesday’s champion-
ship game. The game will be
played full court with 12 minute
quarters and a stop clock. The
All—Stars were never behind in
their contest with the Buckeyes,
and were only tied once in the
entire game. The Stars dominated
the boards, and outshot the Buck-
eyes in the victory.

'Miles Ranc and Clint Logan
did the rebounding and scoring
for the Stars. Ranc scored 26
points, and Logan 17 in the up-
set.

The Buckeyes, who lost their
first game in two- years here,
couldn’t contain 'their frustra-
tions in the second half. When
JimTraﬁcant committed his fifth"
personal foul, he refused to leave
the game, accusing the referees
of cheating. ‘ '_

The Stars allowed Traﬁcant to
stay in the game, however, be-
cause the Buckeyes didn’t "have
a substitute. John Chisdak, All-
Star substitute, explained their
strategy. “We knew we could

beat them, and we didn’t want
to win by a foreﬁt.”

Director Leo Bemis commented
on the relative abilities of the
teams after the game. “On a big
court the Buckeye’s size and
roughness ddesn’t mean much.
The A11—Stars simply had more
basketball ability, and that counts
a. lot more than size.”

On T1'aﬁcant’s basketball prow-
ess, the soccer coach said, “Tran-
cant is a gunner, but playing full
court at the Stadium gym, he had

got tired in the second half. That
made it a lot harder for him to
gun.”

'The Buckeyes defeated Apart-
ment “C” on the previous night,
95-69. Traﬁcant scored 41 points
to lead the devastating Buckeye
assult. _

The “C” boys were only down
by two at the half, but couldn’t
overcome the Buckeye bulk of
Lou Slaby, ET-raficant and Al

Jim lAntonini led the Apart-
ment in scoring with 22. points.

Sykes Reed, Steve Mehalik and
Don Davis combined togive the
Juniors consecutive wins over
Delta Sig, and the MBA. Reed
scored 15, Mehalik ‘17, and Da-

Businessmen. *

Sam Mudie, usually a strong
rebounder for MBA, had troublle
getting inside against Reed, as
the Dentists dominated the boards.
Fred Kellinger had 16 points,
and Mudie 15, in the loser’s vain
effort to gain a finals berth.

The Juniors held John Jenkins
to seven points in their victory
over the Delta Sigs. Davis scored
20, Reed 14, and Mehalik 13.

John Pignetti scored 15 and

Cioffi, Riccuiti Named Captains

Of Panther Diamond Squad

First—baseman John Cioffi and shortstop Al Riccuiti have

been named co-captains of the

Panther baseball team. It is

the second straight year that Cioiti has been accorded this

honor.

In addition to his baseball duties, .Ciof’fi carries a 3.2 QPA
in marketing and is married-‘ and the "father of albaby girl.

Ciofﬁ played the outﬁeld as a?
sophomore’; but mad_e the switch
to first base with remarkable ease;
He was originally slated to handle
that position for only a few games
until the freshman became eli-
gible, but i.mpressed Coach Bob
Lewis so much with his glove,
that me remained a permanent
fixture at first.

,'_I‘he switch of position did not
bother Cio_lﬁ’s batting average
either. He hit a solid .292 on a
tealn that had only four hit-
ters over. .260, despite an 11-6
record. 

Riccuiti has been the ,“big
stick” for Lewis ever since he

first donned a ‘uniform in 1961.

He hit ‘over .400 in his ﬁrst ’

year of competition and .392

last year, even though pitch-

ers were hesitant-to throw him
anything good. '

Riccuiti, a physical education
major, has had major league
scouts following him for two
years thanks to his booming bat
and smooth ﬁelding. He is ex-
pected to sign a contract when
he graduates,

The two captains were elect-‘

ed by: vote of the team's 13

returning lettermen.

 

John Cioﬁi
Team Leaders

"Al Riccuiti

‘-‘The team made a good choice,”

said Coach Bob Lewis. “Both
boys are solid team leaders.
They’ve -both hustled -to keep
their positions and both are

clutch‘ ballplayers. They should_

set a goodexample for the team
to follow this season.”

Squash Tourney

Dave O’Loughlin, the N0; 1
man on the.squash team, was re-
cently defeated in, the quarter-
finals’ of ,the National Int_ercol-
legiate Squash Tournament.-

He blew 14-9 and l1—9’lefads
against second-seeded Vic Nieder-

P"'loNsi 5
s R°VI°W5'

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

James Baldwin is back and
he’s bolder, brassier and more
bitter than ever in his latest
essay collection, The V Fire
Next Time( Dial Press; 120

_ pp.; $3.50).

The slender volume is actually
one long essay and one brief let-

‘ ter to Baldwin's nephew, written

on the one hundredth anniversary
of the Emancipation Proclamation.
Both deal with the American
Negro’s problem of ﬁnding .a way
to live in the insane world the
whites have created for him.

The shorter piece is Baldwin’s
writing at its absolute best.
Where the main" portion of the

‘book rambles and baektracks a

bit, the letter is straight-forward,
simple and clean. In it, he out-
lines the situation of the Negro
as he sees it for his nephew, and
advises him, without patronizing
or being dogmatic, on how to ﬁnd

' the courage, or better, the reason,

for living. _
Approaches Poetry

The letter, which unquestion-
ably approaches poetry in its
rhythm, balance and construction,
sets the stage for the longer
piece; an essay which deals with
the same subject‘ but which il-
lustrates Baldwin’s cleverness,
bitterness, his eye for reality and
his eye for beauty.

The prize-winning novelist
discusses Negroes as he knows
_them and touches on two main
subjects: the role of religion in
his life and the role of the.
Black Muslim movement of re-
cent years.‘

The ﬁrst part of the essay re—'

iterates what doors religion, pro-
mised,him and other inhabitants
of his boyhood Harlem, and his
own religious experiences, which

he wrote about in his ﬁrst novel,

Go Tell it on The Mountain, are
again covered In regard to the
color quesiton.
Helps Understanding

He ﬁnds his religious training
helpful in understanding the
Black Muslims, a violently anti-
white movement. His description
of his visit with Elijah, the head
of the national organization, re-
veals the various manifestations
of Negro bitterness today and
how his own anger ‘differs from
that of the militant Muslims.

Baldwin hates the situation

which the American Negro is in

‘The Fire

Next Time’  

today, but while religion has
not “saved” him, it has given
him a background for channel-
ing his bitterness into allowing
him to thinkand see for him-
self.
And what he sees is a beauty in
the agony of the Negro’s part of

American history, a beauty which"

causes him to class the Black
Muslims with the old-time Har-
lem curbside tub-thumpers; a
beauty in his race which, if any-
thing,» intensiﬁes his acrimonious
view of discrimination, but which
still leaves him miles ‘ahead of‘
Negro “organizers” and “philo-
sophers” of today. Baldwin says
it this way in the end of his essay:

“When I was young, and was
dealing with my buddies in those
wine-and urine-stained hallways,
something in me wondered What
will happen to all that beauty?
. . . And when I sat at Elijah’s
table . . . and we talked of . . .
vengeance, I wondered, when that
vengeance comes, What will hap-
pen to all that beauty?”

And still bitter and still proud,
Baldwin’ stirringly demands, as
his‘ ﬁnal note, that conscious
blacks and whites not falter in
ending the racial nightmare, be-
cause: " ,

“If we do not dare everything,
fulfillment of that prophecy, re-
created from the Bible in song by
a slave, is upon us: ‘God gave
Noah the rainbow sign, no more
water, the ﬁre next time!”
